5
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:26,287
Okay, let's--
let's just hear her out.

6
00:00:27,766 --> 00:00:29,377
After the assassination
of the archduke,

7
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,857
Europe's rival alliances
declared war on each other.

8
00:00:31,901 --> 00:00:34,077
This singular murder
led to 20 million deaths.

9
00:00:34,121 --> 00:00:35,992
The assassination
of the archduke, therefore,

10
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,081
is what is known
as a fixed point in history.

11
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:39,517
Sorry, a fixed point?

12
00:00:39,561 --> 00:00:41,258
Fixed point. Noun.

13
00:00:41,302 --> 00:00:43,434
An occurrence
so pivotal to history

14
00:00:43,478 --> 00:00:45,871
that no time travel
is allowed on or near it.

15
00:00:45,915 --> 00:00:48,048
I'm a little fuzzy
on my time travel logic.

16
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:49,962
How is this a good idea?

17
00:00:50,006 --> 00:00:51,964
Yes, I appreciate
your resolve, Miss Gideon,

18
00:00:52,008 --> 00:00:54,619
but, you see, we can't just go
and prevent the Great War.

19
00:00:54,663 --> 00:00:56,230
Now, you were the ones
that taught me that.

20
00:00:56,273 --> 00:00:57,970
Well, exactly.
Fixed points

21
00:00:58,014 --> 00:00:59,929
are shrouded in mystery,
even to evil Gideon.

22
00:00:59,972 --> 00:01:02,453
Still, she and her robots
won't be able to resist

23
00:01:02,497 --> 00:01:04,760
restoring the timeline,
and we will let them.

24
00:01:04,803 --> 00:01:08,459
Oh, so we're not actually
going to stop the World War.

25
00:01:08,503 --> 00:01:10,418
We're just gonna let her
think we are to lure her in.

26
00:01:10,461 --> 00:01:13,116
And the assassination was
a notoriously chaotic event,

27
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,814
Which will give us the window
we need to take back the ship.

28

Making the robots do the work

That is diabolical, Gideon.

31
00:01:22,647 --> 00:01:25,215
- I learned from the best.
- All right, gang.

32
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:28,697
I know it has been a rough road
since we lost our Waverider,

33
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,873
but that ends now.

34
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:33,005
This time we're gonna win,

35
00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:36,966

36
00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:38,402
All right, gang-gang.

37
00:01:38,446 --> 00:01:40,448
The assassination
was such a famous fiasco,

38
00:01:40,491 --> 00:01:44,016
I kindly decided to draw you
a diagram to help explain.

39
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,758
Ooh, I didn't know
you were an artist.

40
00:01:46,802 --> 00:01:48,586
And now I see why.

41
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:51,372
No, I get it.
It's...abstract.

42
00:01:51,415 --> 00:01:54,288
Okay, so my drawing skills
are a little rusty.

43
00:01:54,331 --> 00:01:56,028
You don't have to be
so insensitive, you jerks.

44
00:01:56,072 --> 00:01:57,856
Now just shut up and focus.
- Sorry.

45
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,337
All right, so there are
members of a secret society

46
00:02:00,381 --> 00:02:02,905
called the Black Hand
on the scene that day,

47
00:02:02,948 --> 00:02:06,604
<i>including the eventual</i> <i>
assassin Gavrilo Princip.</i>

48
00:02:06,648 --> 00:02:08,258
The assassin set up a course

49
00:02:08,302 --> 00:02:09,868
from the archduke's
motorcade route in Sarajevo.

50
00:02:09,912 --> 00:02:11,435
Copy.

51
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:13,959
Where does the hippopotamus
come into play?

52
00:02:14,003 --> 00:02:16,223
That's the archduke's car.

53
00:02:16,266 --> 00:02:18,529
<i>He's waving.</i>

54
00:02:18,573 --> 00:02:21,532
Oh, very abstract.

55
00:02:22,577 --> 00:02:26,058
Okay, so we will set up here
next to the balloon salesman.

56
00:02:26,102 --> 00:02:29,323
That is the assassin,
and he's holding a grenade.

57
00:02:30,454 --> 00:02:32,195
The assassin tossed
the grenade at the motorcade,

58
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,590
<i>but it bounced off the car</i> <i>
and blew up nearby.</i>

59
00:02:35,633 --> 00:02:37,374
So Princip,
with his mission a bust,

60
00:02:37,418 --> 00:02:39,333
went to a nearby sandwich shop.

61
00:02:39,376 --> 00:02:41,552
Hey, I see that sandwich,
and you know what?

62
00:02:41,596 --> 00:02:43,859
That is some attention
to detail on the lettuce.

63
00:02:43,902 --> 00:02:46,122
Good job, bud.
- Yeah.

64
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,906
That's an explosion.

65
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,647
The motorcade
took a wrong turn

66
00:02:49,691 --> 00:02:52,215
<i>and went straight past</i> <i>
Princip's lunch spot.</i>

67
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:54,261
<i>So Princip</i> <i>
sees the archduke,</i>

68
00:02:54,304 --> 00:02:57,612
<i>realizes this is his moment,</i>

69
00:02:57,655 --> 00:02:59,440
<i>and shoots him point-blank.</i>

70
00:02:59,483 --> 00:03:04,314
Okay, so our surest shot
at unfixing the fixpoint

71
00:03:04,358 --> 00:03:07,274
is to take out
the three assassins.

72
00:03:07,317 --> 00:03:09,885
And the best place to do that
is at the Cosic Tavern

73
00:03:09,928 --> 00:03:11,495
where the assassins
went that morning.

74
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:13,454
Okay, so we'll knock out
the Black Hand

75
00:03:13,497 --> 00:03:15,325
just long enough
that they miss the motorcade.

76
00:03:15,369 --> 00:03:17,980
Meanwhile, we'll need
to hide the time machine.

77
00:03:18,023 --> 00:03:19,503
Astra can work
her Permuto spell,

78
00:03:19,547 --> 00:03:20,809
turn it into something
more portable,

79
00:03:20,852 --> 00:03:22,071
and bring it back here.

80
00:03:22,114 --> 00:03:23,638

- Nice

81
00:03:23,681 --> 00:03:25,814
And then the team
will get into position.

82

- By that swimming pool.
- Field, Gary.

83
00:03:28,382 --> 00:03:30,514
Field. And when
Gideon sends her robots

84

the 20th century on course,

85

161
00:08:17,758 --> 00:08:19,107
kills you.

162
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,891
Time can do that?

163
00:08:20,935 --> 00:08:23,938
No one's ever even made it
to the last assassin.

164
00:08:23,981 --> 00:08:27,942
But if you're so determined,
you're in the queue,

165
00:08:27,985 --> 00:08:31,249
and by the look
of today's competitors,

166
00:08:31,293 --> 00:08:33,251
your turn will be up soon.

167
00:08:33,295 --> 00:08:38,909
<i>♪</i>

168
00:08:42,434 --> 00:08:43,914
All right, Gwyn,

169
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:45,437
if we're gonna save Alun,
we have to be smart.

170
00:08:45,481 --> 00:08:46,830
We can't cause any ripples
that might affect

171
00:08:46,874 --> 00:08:48,528
the larger timeline.
- I understand.

172
00:08:48,571 --> 00:08:50,268
And I have to say,
I am mightily appreciative

173
00:08:50,312 --> 00:08:52,140
that you've changed
your mind on this, Miss Sharpe.

174
00:08:52,183 --> 00:08:53,707
Thank you.
- We would be dead

175
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,230
if it weren't for you.
We can give you this.

176
00:08:55,273 --> 00:08:57,232
My divine mission
is almost complete.

177
00:08:57,275 --> 00:08:58,581
Now let me show you.

178
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:00,583
This is where Alun
was ambushed.

179
00:09:00,627 --> 00:09:02,019
Oh, perfect.
Here you go.

180
00:09:02,063 --> 00:09:03,281
Ooh!

181
00:09:03,325 --> 00:09:05,066
Oh, little soldiers.
- Yes.

182
00:09:05,109 --> 00:09:06,633
I found them in the attic.

183
00:09:06,676 --> 00:09:08,112
Constantine was a bit of a hoarder.

184
00:09:08,156 --> 00:09:10,462
Ooh, seems like
a very peculiar fellow.

185
00:09:10,506 --> 00:09:11,812
Mr. Green!
- Hm?

186
00:09:13,204 --> 00:09:14,249
What?
Is the Waverider here?

187
00:09:14,292 --> 00:09:15,772
Uh, not yet.

188
00:09:15,816 --> 00:09:18,253
I'm just here to drop off
Gwyn's time machine.

189
00:09:19,646 --> 00:09:21,299
Astra said
it should change back soon.

190
00:09:21,343 --> 00:09:23,475
Well, I'll assume
that that makes sense then.

191
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,781
No, that makes
absolutely no sense.

192
00:09:24,825 --> 00:09:26,000
What happened
with the archduke?

193
00:09:26,043 --> 00:09:27,654
Oh, we're still waiting
our turn

194
00:09:27,697 --> 00:09:30,526
in a sort of time travel
"Cheers" meets Thunder Dome.

195
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,311
- What's a Thunder Dome?
- Uh, you don't want to know.

196
00:09:33,355 --> 00:09:35,226
Wait, stop, is everyone, uh...
- No, no, we're fine.

197
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:38,055
We're fine. It's a pub
filled with time travelers.

198
00:09:38,099 --> 00:09:39,927
Yeah, people like us

199
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:41,668
who are there
to save the archduke.

200
00:09:41,711 --> 00:09:43,495
A whole community
of time travelers

201
00:09:43,539 --> 00:09:45,497
all with
the same aim and purpose.

202
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:47,369
Wow, Gwyn, none of this

203
00:09:47,412 --> 00:09:49,632
would exist
without your invention.

204
00:09:51,678 --> 00:09:53,854
Wait a s--
uh-oh.

205
00:09:53,897 --> 00:09:55,638
None of this would exist
without your invention,

206
00:09:55,682 --> 00:09:57,205
which means
if we go on to save Alun,

207
00:09:57,248 --> 00:09:58,336
you never invent time travel,
which means

208
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,729
no Waverider, no Legends.

209
00:09:59,773 --> 00:10:00,991
And no one to go back
to save Alun

210
00:10:01,035 --> 00:10:03,080
in the first place?

211
00:10:03,124 --> 00:10:05,082
Ah, I can't deal with
all these time loops

212
00:10:05,126 --> 00:10:06,518
and paradoxes all in one day.

213
00:10:06,562 --> 00:10:09,130
I'm just gonna leave this
in the foyer.

214
00:10:09,173 --> 00:10:11,785
Okay, okay, okay,
so, uh, it's not as simple

215
00:10:11,828 --> 00:10:13,395
as saving Alun
from the Germans, right?

216
00:10:13,438 --> 00:10:14,701
But we just have to
make sure that you go on

217
00:10:14,744 --> 00:10:16,224
to invent time travel.

218
00:10:16,267 --> 00:10:17,921
Oh, I've already
solved that, Miss Sharpe.

219
00:10:17,965 --> 00:10:20,750
You see,
my mission is to save Alun.

220
00:10:20,794 --> 00:10:23,753
However, my younger self
must never find out.

221
00:10:23,797 --> 00:10:25,929
I must always end up here.

222
00:10:27,365 --> 00:10:29,280
What? But...

223
00:10:29,324 --> 00:10:31,282
that means he'd be
out there alive, and you'd be--

224
00:10:31,326 --> 00:10:33,284
Alone.

225
00:10:33,328 --> 00:10:36,592
So let me show you
where he was ambushed.

226
00:10:37,201 --> 00:10:39,160
Time is killing people?

227
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:42,380
I don't even understand
how time can have this power.

228
00:10:42,424 --> 00:10:43,599
But I suppose
I've never questioned

229
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,209
what made
a fixed point fixed.

230
00:10:45,253 --> 00:10:47,690
Who knew time travel
could be this complicated?

231
00:10:47,734 --> 00:10:49,170
I don't know how you've wrapped

232
00:10:49,213 --> 00:10:50,911
your human brains around it
all these years.

233
00:10:50,954 --> 00:10:53,261
Oh, wait.
Yes, I do.

234
00:10:53,304 --> 00:10:54,871
I need a drink.

235
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,309
Hey, I mean,
we could grab a--

236
00:10:58,353 --> 00:11:00,050
Do you want to go check out
the betting tables?

237
00:11:00,094 --> 00:11:01,573
- You bet.
- Right, well, I'll see you.

238
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,361
I mean, we could hang out
or something.

239
00:11:06,404 --> 00:11:07,841
Unless you have some plans.

240
00:11:07,884 --> 00:11:10,234
No, yeah, we, uh...

241
00:11:10,278 --> 00:11:14,064
you know, we have never done
the one-on-one...

242
00:11:14,108 --> 00:11:15,370
thing.

243
00:11:15,413 --> 00:11:17,111
Yeah. We should...
after you.

244
00:11:17,154 --> 00:11:18,765
- O-okay, I'll go.
- Okay.

245
00:11:18,808 --> 00:11:20,984
Ah, what can I get you folks?

246
00:11:21,028 --> 00:11:24,074
Two stouts, please.
Anything for you?

247
00:11:24,118 --> 00:11:28,122
Oh, uh,
I'll just have the one.

248
00:11:29,427 --> 00:11:30,472
Thank you.

249
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:34,781
Now, when you say time's
out there killing people,

250
00:11:34,824 --> 00:11:36,434
like, you can't mean literally,

251
00:11:36,478 --> 00:11:38,349
'cause that
doesn't make any sense.

252
00:11:38,393 --> 00:11:40,177
Well, I know
it's a lot to take in,

253
00:11:40,221 --> 00:11:42,397
but you've gotta
trust me on this one.

254
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,138
I've been in
the time travel game

255
00:11:44,181 --> 00:11:47,271
for a long...time.

256
00:11:47,315 --> 00:11:49,273
Oh, you've been in it
for a long time.

257
00:11:49,317 --> 00:11:51,319
Okay, well, then I guess
that makes you the authority.

258
00:11:51,362 --> 00:11:52,712
Well...

259
00:11:53,451 --> 00:11:56,716
I guess that does
make you the authority.

260
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:58,195
All these years,

261
00:11:58,239 --> 00:11:59,762
I never even knew
the fixed point had a bar.

262
00:11:59,806 --> 00:12:01,416
Oh, don't be
too hard on yourself.

263
00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:04,114
It's always been
a word-of-mouth kinda place,

264
00:12:04,158 --> 00:12:05,768
and besides, you're young.

265
00:12:05,812 --> 00:12:09,032
You can't expect to know
all there is to know.

266
00:12:10,555 --> 00:12:12,209
You're right.

267
00:12:12,253 --> 00:12:13,907
Here I am thinking
I've infinite knowledge,

268
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,561
but, I mean, what do I know?
What do I know, Gary?

269
00:12:16,605 --> 00:12:18,259
Hmm? Okay, for example, okay,

270
00:12:18,302 --> 00:12:21,305
what is a--a pickleback, hm?

271
00:12:21,349 --> 00:12:23,960
Oh, does that come in large?

272
00:12:26,658 --> 00:12:28,835
This is--this is great.

273
00:12:28,878 --> 00:12:30,227
- Mm-hmm.
- Right?

274
00:12:30,271 --> 00:12:32,534
I mean, this is great.

275
00:12:32,577 --> 00:12:35,232
I mean, like, us.
Finally.

276
00:12:35,276 --> 00:12:36,886
Right? I--
Yeah.

277
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:39,236
You know, it usually gets
so crazy around here,

278
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,936
we never get a chance
to just...hang.

279
00:12:42,979 --> 00:12:44,764
Totally, totally.

280
00:12:44,807 --> 00:12:46,983
Yeah, 'cause, you know,
what--what people do together

281
00:12:47,027 --> 00:12:49,594
is they...

282
00:12:49,638 --> 00:12:50,813
they talk.

283
00:12:50,857 --> 00:12:52,597
- Yeah. Yes.
- Right? About...

284
00:12:55,644 --> 00:12:56,863
Topics.

285
00:12:56,906 --> 00:12:58,255
Right.
Yes, yes.

286
00:12:58,299 --> 00:13:00,040
I mean, we all
love topics, right?

287
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:02,825
I mean, you know, there's--
there's things like...

288
00:13:04,566 --> 00:13:05,828
Makeup.

289
00:13:05,872 --> 00:13:07,569
Right, yeah?
- Ah, I do.

290
00:13:07,612 --> 00:13:09,789
Yeah, I like makeup,
but, you know,

291
00:13:09,832 --> 00:13:12,400
we can also talk about, uh...

292
00:13:12,443 --> 00:13:13,662
guns.

293
00:13:13,705 --> 00:13:15,751
Yeah. Yeah, we could.

294
00:13:17,492 --> 00:13:18,449
Yeah.

295
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:25,543
The second assassin
is this salt shaker, okay?

296
00:13:25,587 --> 00:13:27,850
Now, he'll get distracted
when this motorcade--

297
00:13:27,894 --> 00:13:29,156
Okay, wait, wait, wait.
I got it.

298
00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:30,766
I got the plan
that not even time

299
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:34,204
is going to see coming.
A true Legends plan.

300
00:13:34,248 --> 00:13:36,206
No. No way!

301
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,382
Are you--are you guys
the Legends Of Tomorrow?

302
00:13:38,426 --> 00:13:41,733
It makes sense we'd be known
around these parts, I guess.

303
00:13:41,777 --> 00:13:43,387
We get around.

304
00:13:49,393 --> 00:13:51,482
Yeah, a bunch
of washed-up superheroes

305
00:13:51,526 --> 00:13:54,398
who think they can beat
the fixed point--cute.

306
00:13:54,442 --> 00:13:56,574
Okay. Calm down.

307
00:13:56,618 --> 00:13:58,838
We are basically
the same age as you.

308
00:14:02,537 --> 00:14:04,800
Sick burn!

309
00:14:06,062 --> 00:14:07,455
Oh, he said that you--

310
00:14:07,498 --> 00:14:09,152
No one cares
what he said, all right?

311
00:14:09,196 --> 00:14:11,198
Why don't you guys go giggle
at your own table?

312
00:14:11,241 --> 00:14:12,939
'Cause we have
adult things to do.

313
00:14:12,982 --> 00:14:15,332
- Wow, aggressive.
- Okay, sorry.

314
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,206
Number 71.

315
00:14:19,249 --> 00:14:21,034
Okay, all right.

316
00:14:21,077 --> 00:14:22,992
Forget those guys...
- Yeah.

317
00:14:23,036 --> 00:14:24,124
Because they do not matter.

318
00:14:24,167 --> 00:14:25,821
All that matters is our plan.

319
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,214
Hear me out.
- Go.

320
00:14:27,257 --> 00:14:28,737
Three assassins fan out.

321
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:29,999
I follow the guy
with the grenade.

322
00:14:30,043 --> 00:14:32,045
Then here, I untie the dog

323
00:14:32,088 --> 00:14:33,176
that's tied to the lamp pole--

324
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,569
And it knocks off the steak

325
00:14:34,612 --> 00:14:36,049
from the table
at the corner café?

326
00:14:36,092 --> 00:14:38,399
Exactly,
and then I use that--

327
00:14:38,442 --> 00:14:40,531
As a distraction
to steal the bike?

328
00:14:40,575 --> 00:14:42,794
Yeah, you got it.
How do you know this?

329
00:14:42,838 --> 00:14:44,971
He's doing it right now.

330
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:48,583
Okay, well, whatever,

331
00:14:48,626 --> 00:14:51,107
because my plan
has a second steak

332
00:14:51,151 --> 00:14:53,544
that I will slip
into the assassin's pocket--

333
00:14:53,588 --> 00:14:56,025
and that's exactly
what he's doing?

334
00:14:56,069 --> 00:14:57,940

No.

476
00:22:27,737 --> 00:22:30,218

out there again and again

the best way to beat time.

What guy with the top hat?

Hey, gang,
we were just in the tavern,

582
00:28:24,615 --> 00:28:26,182
and Spooner
saw this guy in a top hat,

583
00:28:26,226 --> 00:28:27,967
but when I turned to look
at him, he disappeared.

584
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:29,533
Yeah, so we walked over
to where he was standing,

585
00:28:29,577 --> 00:28:32,536
and my bad guy radar went off,
big time.

586
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,190
- A man in a top hat?
- Yeah.

587
00:28:34,234 --> 00:28:37,063
And I swear
I've seen him along the route.

588
00:28:37,106 --> 00:28:39,152
Maybe he's on the film.

589
00:28:46,072 --> 00:28:47,769
Stop.
There.

590
00:28:47,813 --> 00:28:49,075
Rewind the film.

591
00:28:51,425 --> 00:28:52,731
Stop.

592
00:28:54,428 --> 00:28:56,038
Can you go to the next frame?

593
00:28:58,824 --> 00:29:01,914
Hm, he's only
in that one frame.

594
00:29:01,957 --> 00:29:03,480
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

595
00:29:03,524 --> 00:29:04,917
He appears right before Sara
makes a move,

596
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,527
and then he disappears,
so maybe--

597
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:10,139
It's not time fixing itself.

598
00:29:10,183 --> 00:29:12,533
It's a person.

599
00:29:16,972 --> 00:29:19,061
So it's a person fixing time,

600
00:29:19,105 --> 00:29:20,976
not actually time
like we thought.

601
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:23,849
Yes! I knew it!

602
00:29:23,892 --> 00:29:25,764
Did I do that right?

603
00:29:25,807 --> 00:29:27,766
Sorry, I'm just relieved that
it's a person and not time.

604
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:30,333
Existential crisis averted.
Carry on.

605
00:29:30,377 --> 00:29:32,466
All right, so we got
to figure out how Mr. Peanut

606
00:29:32,509 --> 00:29:35,121
keeps fixing time,
then disappearing.

607
00:29:38,211 --> 00:29:41,344
It is like he's stopping time.

608
00:29:44,347 --> 00:29:45,914
What if he is?

609
00:29:45,958 --> 00:29:48,612
Breakthrough.
Sara's having a breakthrough.

610
00:29:48,656 --> 00:29:52,051
What is this top hat guy
has the ability to freeze time?

611
00:29:52,094 --> 00:29:55,794
And then he fixes the timeline,
and then he restarts it

612
00:29:55,837 --> 00:29:57,665
without anyone knowing
he was there.

613
00:29:57,708 --> 00:30:00,494
- Called it.
- Nice.

614
00:30:00,537 --> 00:30:01,974
Right, how are we supposed
to beat someone

I just wish there was some way

to his time-freezing powers.

618
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,505
Well, there is one way.

619
00:30:13,507 --> 00:30:16,118
Dr. Davies, do you think
you could let us borrow

620
00:30:16,162 --> 00:30:18,077
the CR-055 superconductor?

want that for then?

an anti-time manipulator.

624
00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:25,736
What do you need
an anti-time manipulator for?

625
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:28,130

I do, and I don't know
what that feels like, okay?

638
00:31:11,957 --> 00:31:15,308
But I do know
that if--if there is a God,

639
00:31:15,351 --> 00:31:20,269
he or she or they--or
whatever pronoun they prefer--

loving whoever it is
you choose, Gwyn,

643
00:31:31,063 --> 00:31:33,804
because love is love

644
00:31:33,848 --> 00:31:37,896
is love is love
is love is love is love.

645

771
00:38:25,781 --> 00:38:27,392
I just need to stop it
long enough

772
00:38:27,435 --> 00:38:29,524
to attract the attention
of our timeship

773
00:38:29,568 --> 00:38:31,613
so we can steal it back
from the evil AI

774
00:38:31,657 --> 00:38:34,312
that's controlling it
and her army of evil robots.

775
00:38:36,749 --> 00:38:39,142
I'm just trying
to get everyone home.

776
00:38:41,144 --> 00:38:45,192
You may be determined to
protect this point in history,

777
00:38:45,235 --> 00:38:47,803
but my drive
to keep my family safe

778
00:38:47,847 --> 00:38:49,718
will break you down.

779
00:38:49,762 --> 00:38:53,200
So unless you have another idea

780
00:38:53,243 --> 00:38:55,376
to get me out of your hair,

781
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:58,292
I guess we should get back

782
00:39:00,381 --> 00:39:02,035
Well...

783
00:39:04,298 --> 00:39:06,561
There is one other idea.

784
00:39:08,215 --> 00:39:09,956
I might be able
to buy you some time

785
00:39:09,999 --> 00:39:11,392
by making it look like

786
00:39:11,436 --> 00:39:13,307
the assassination
was prevented.

787
00:39:14,221 --> 00:39:15,527
How?

788
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:17,311
I'll make it
so Gabriela Princip

789
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,357
will still assassinate
the archduke,

790
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,880
only in 40 minutes,

791
00:39:20,923 --> 00:39:23,056
but your ship's AI
won't know that.

792
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:26,538
It'll just think that there's
been a five-alarm aberration.

793
00:39:26,581 --> 00:39:28,888
40 minutes is plenty of time
for us to get our ship back.

794
00:39:28,931 --> 00:39:31,412
Fair warning, though,
you go one second over,

795
00:39:31,456 --> 00:39:34,807
and I will have no choice
but to try and kill you again,

796
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:38,071
and if you kill me,
you must swear

797

to take up my post
and protect the fixed point.

00:39:47,733 --> 00:39:49,082
You have a deal.

799
00:40:01,964 --> 00:40:03,749
You got 40 minutes,
Sara Lance.

00:40:06,795 --> 00:40:13,802

801
00:40:26,511 --> 00:40:29,644
Yes!
Yes!

802
00:40:29,688 --> 00:40:32,168
They actually did it.

803
00:40:32,212 --> 00:40:33,692
Now what happens?

804
00:40:33,735 --> 00:40:37,130
Oh, time is being rewritten
as we speak.

805
00:40:38,392 --> 00:40:41,482
<i>- Get into your positions.</i>
- Hey, you two, stay here.

806
00:40:41,526 --> 00:40:43,702
Oh, yes, Dr. Haywood.
Yes, of course.

807
00:40:43,745 --> 00:40:45,312
Oh! Oh, my lord.

808
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,577
I've always wanted
to do that.

809
00:40:49,621 --> 00:40:50,970
Me too.

810
00:40:52,101 --> 00:40:54,147
Wow.
Okay, fantastic.

811
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,888
Ooh, oh.

812
00:40:55,931 --> 00:40:59,152
We'll, uh,
hold the fort, as it is.

813
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:06,551
There she is.

814
00:41:09,641 --> 00:41:15,473
Get ready, Legends.
This time, there's no do-overs.

815
00:41:37,451 --> 00:41:38,539
Greg, move your head.
