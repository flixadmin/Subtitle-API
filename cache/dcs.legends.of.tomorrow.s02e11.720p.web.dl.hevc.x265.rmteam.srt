1
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:04,540
- Seriously, you idiots haven't
figured this out by now?

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:06,540
It all started
when we blew up the time pigs,

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:08,510
the time masters,

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,850
now history's all screwed up,
and it's up to us

5
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:12,050
to unscrew it up.

6
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:15,220
Half the time,
we screw things up even worse.

7
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:18,220
So don't call us heroes,
we're something else.

8
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:19,720
We're legends.

9
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,290
Who writes this crap anyway?

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,260
- Previously on
"legends of tomorrow"...

11
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,870
- Have either of you gentlemen
heard of the spear of destiny?

12
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:31,070
- Yes, it was the spear
that was purportedly used

13
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:34,040
to penetrate the side of Christ
after he died on the cross.

14
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,740
- And now, it can be used
to rewrite reality itself.

15
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,080
- Then what would the speedster
need the spear of destiny for?

16
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,050
He could just go back
and change history himself.

17
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:45,180
- Changes to history cause
timequakes and aberrations,

18
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:46,650
which we can undo.

19
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,120
Changes to reality, however,
those are permanent.

20
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,320
- Who's coming for you?

21
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,660
- It's not a who.
It's a...

22
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,630
It's a what.

23
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:55,660
He can sense the speed force.

24
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,600
- And it's trying to kill me.

25
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:03,200
- You created an interface
between a mystical relic

26
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,010
from the first century and
a 22nd-century supercomputer.

27
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:08,970
- A deep scan reveals
that captain hunter's

28
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:11,180
neural architecture
has been reprogrammed

29
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,710
with a new identity.

30
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,280
- It's a mnemonic archive,
designed to store memories.

31
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:19,620
Rip hunter's.

32
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,420
Including the locations
of the other pieces

33
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,950
of the spear, I hope.

34
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,520
- We would hardly be doing
captain hunter any favors

35
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,860
if we just restored the memories
without taking the Liberty

36
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,860
to address
some of his shortcomings.

37
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:32,500
- Can I help you
with something, soldier?

38
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,600
- No, general Washington,
I'm fine.

39
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,940
You, on the other hand...

40
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:44,310
Stand at ease.

41
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,110
Gentlemen, general Washington
is dead.

42
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:48,710
All: Hooray!

43
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,480
- Now, I know you would all like
nothing more than to return home

44
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,850
from these godforsaken colonies,

45
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:57,020
but the rebellion
is not yet quelled.

46
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,190
The fight is not yet finished.

47
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:04,960
But that doesn't mean we have to
fight fair, now does it?

48
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,270
These Americans...

49
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,240
They call themselves patriots,

50
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,240
but they will die as traitors.

51
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,180
Grab yourselves a rifle, lads.

52
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:24,520
After all, it's Christmas.

53
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,960
- You killed George Washington.

54
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,460
- Yes, I know.

55
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,360
Well, that should get
my former teammates' attention,

56
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,060
and when they travel
back in time to save him,

57
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,260
I'll be there waiting for them
with open arms.

58
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,630
- Well, not too open, I hope.

59
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,270
- No, have no fear, Mr. thawne.

60
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,440
I have no lingering attachment.

61
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,740
- Ah, in that case,
kill them all,

62
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,170
collect their fragment
of the spear of destiny,

63
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,780
and bring it to me.

64
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:58,720
- Whoever knew time travel
would be so much fun?

65
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:10,090
- how long till Lily's interface
tracks down another piece

66
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,460
of the spear of destiny?

67
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,630
- I don't know.
I'm beginning to think

68
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,570
our supercomputer
is not so super.

69
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,000
- I heard that.

70
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,300
You try processing
1.2 zettabytes of data.

71
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,110
- Rip's probably being tortured
by the legion of doom right now.

72
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:23,540
The sooner we can locate
another piece of the spear,

73
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,710
the sooner we can set a trap
and rescue him.

74
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,780
- I could always
reroute power to my sub-neural

75
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,310
processing unit
by shutting off life support.

76
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,820
- Oh, you're lippy
this morning, Gideon.

77
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,120
I like it.

78
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,790
- I wasn't joking.

79
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,160
- Old buddy, old pal?

80
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,990
New news, I found
rat droppings in my room.

81
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,630
- And you're telling me
this because?

82
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,260
- 'Cause rats follow crumbs.
Crumbs you drop

83
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,800
any time you eat anything.

84
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,060
- What would you
have me do then,

85
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:47,270
use a knife and fork?

86
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,470
- I would have you clean up
after yourself.

87
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:50,740
We've been all over time.

88
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,740
That rat could have
bubonic plague.

89
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,940
Ah!

90
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,180
I've overstepped.
I see that now.

91
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,750
- You know, I thought I was
gonna hate Ray's chore wheel,

92
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,680
but breakfast duty's
kind of fun.

93
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:09,050
And it tastes way better
than a food fabricator.

94
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,260
- It feels almost normal.
- Right?

95
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,860
- I don't know
what day of the week it is.

96
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,660
That I don't know
how they got used to.

97
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,730
- See, that's the problem
with the temporal zone.

98
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,700
You don't know if it's Sunday.
You don't know if it's Monday.

99
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,770
And Sunday should feel
different than Monday.

100
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:22,700
I love what we do.
I do.

101
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:26,270
It's just sometimes I just wish
I could get off this ship.

102
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,940
- Yeah, exactly.
- Yeah.

103
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:32,110
- I just wanna breathe some
fresh air and see some trees.

104
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:34,880
You know, when I first moved
from zambesi to D.C.,

105
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,220
I used go camping every weekend.

106
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,650
I just love being outside,
under the stars.

107
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:42,190
- That sounds terrible
and cold and miserable.

108
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:45,660
I'm a city guy, and that
does not work for me whatsoever.

109
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,460
- What, is there
something on my face?

110
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,330
- A little.

111
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:52,600
- Can you please get it off?

112
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,000
Okay.

113
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:02,470
Um... I should go get the...
- no, um...

114
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:08,810
- Um, what was that?

115
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,180
- Did you guys
feel that timequake?

116
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,050
It must have been
a monster aberration.

117
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,250
Gideon?

118
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,520
- The shock wave's
point of origin

119
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,160
was December 25th, 1776.

120
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,620
- That's the night
George Washington

121
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,390
led the continental army
across the Delaware.

122
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,960
- Huh.
- I'm afraid not.

123
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,030
General Washington
was murdered that Christmas.

124
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,370
- This is a trap.

125
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:29,070
It's Chicago all over again.

126
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:32,740
Thawne and his buddies
are trying to lure us into 1776.

127
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,810
- Very effectively, I might add.
- Yeah.

128
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:38,010
- You wish to speak, Mr. Rory?
I noticed the death

129
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:40,310
of our forefather hasn't
diminished your appetite.

130
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,010
- Mm, Washington's a punk.

131
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,580
- He led America to independence
and became its first president.

132
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:47,180
- Well, without Washington,
America wouldn't have democracy.

133
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,820
Or "Hamilton."

134
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,490
- If Washington's so cool,
why his he on the $1 bill

135
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:52,920
and Franklin's on the $100 bill?

136
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,130
Now he's cool.

137
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:56,090
- He is cool, but he didn't
lead the troops

138
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,760
across the Delaware
in a sneak attack.

139
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,200
Washington did.
And, if that offensive fails,

140
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,800
the American revolution fails,
and the United States

141
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,540
ceases to exist.
- Like I said, trap.

142
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,810
- Well, surely you're not
suggesting we do nothing.

143
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:10,780
- No, we have to
save Washington.

144
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:14,110
We just need to be
careful about it.

145
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:16,810
Let's buckle up.

146
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,020
- Wait, how do we even know
where to find Washington?

147
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,690
- The night before
crossing the Delaware,

148
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:23,920
Washington was in Pennsylvania
at the home of William Keith.

149
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,560
- So we're just gonna
break into someone's house

150
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,030
on Christmas Eve?
- Yep, just like Santa.

151
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,960
- Keith would've thrown
a Christmas banquet

152
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,330
for Washington and his men.

153
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,530
- Ooh, secret mission
on Christmas Eve.

154
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:35,530
- Congratulations, Mick,
you just became

155
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,070
a private in the U.S. army.

156
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:39,900
Nate, Amaya, you two will pose
as wealthy newlyweds

157
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:43,070
eager to make a contribution
to the revolutionary cause.

158
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,180
Jax and Stein,
quarterback the mission

159
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,680
from the ship.
At the first sign of trouble,

160
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,180
you firestorm up.

161
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,310
Ray, I need you to miniaturize
down in the atom suit...

162
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,380
A toy in a Christmas stocking.

163
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,990
- And run reconnaissance.

164
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:58,790
All right,
let's go save America.

165
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,620
- a Christmas banquet in 1776.
This is so...

166
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,020
- stupid.

167
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:32,720
- Where's your Christmas spirit?
- Ho-ho-ho.

168
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,260
- Ah, you're from Boston.
- Mm-hmm.

169
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:43,130
- Tell me, are you familiar
with the sons of Liberty?

170
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:46,140
- Oh, intimately,
my wife and I are avid...

171
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:49,410
We're... we're avid supporters.

172
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:51,340
- This is your wife?

173
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,080
- Yes.
- We're newlyweds, actually.

174
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,280
- Brand new.

175
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,550
- Ah, well, they, um,
they certainly do things

176
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:59,520
differently up in Boston.

177
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,190
- Could I interest you
in a glass of eggnog, ma'am?

178
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,950
- Thanks.

179
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:07,990
It's got a kick.

180
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,930
- It's my wife Martha's recipe.

181
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:12,160
A little heavy on the rum,
but, in these trying times,

182
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:15,100
I believe extra rum
is warranted.

183
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:15,900
- Martha...

184
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,500
You're George Washington.

185
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,970
- At your service.

186
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:24,240
Now tell me, from which
of our 13 fair colonies

187
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,710
do you hail from?

188
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,040
- The first one.

189
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:29,150
- Get him out of there, Sara.

190
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:31,180
General Washington,
we have to go.

191
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,650
I don't have time to explain,
but your life is in danger.

192
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,630
- Hold position!

193
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:42,790
- We need to go.

194
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,500
- I will not retreat.

195
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,570
- I insist.

196
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,170
- Georgie, out the back, now.

197
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,370
- You are a most unusual woman.

198
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:53,440
- Oh!

199
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,310
- Shall we dance?
- What?

200
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,850
- Dip.

201
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:04,680
- Merry Christmas!

202
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:14,960
- oof!

203
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:21,830
- what happened to the power?

204
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:23,030
- How would I know?

205
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,370
You're supposed to be
the engineer.

206
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:26,470
- Ah, oof.
Oh.

207
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:28,540
Guys, my suit just died.

208
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,810
Guys?
Hello?

209
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:33,310
Whoa, hey!
Ah!

210
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,950
Nate, Nate!

211
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:40,650
Hey, hey, look down here!

212
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,150
- Ray?

213
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,420
- My gun, it's fried!
- We should turn back.

214
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,860
- Protecting you
is our first priority.

215
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:52,300
Rip?

216
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,930
Rip.

217
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:57,470
How did you get here?
- I don't like this.

218
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:58,840
- Rip.

219
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,540
- Hello, Sara.

220
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:06,510
Good-bye, Sara.

221
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:07,510
- Son of a bitch.

222
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:10,010
- Mr. Rory, we meet again.

223
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,680
- What the hell is
wrong with you?

224
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,380
- On the contrary,
nothing has ever been

225
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:15,220
more right.

226
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:20,830
If anything, we're a bit more
alike now, aren't we?

227
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:21,990
Take them away!

228
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,450
- Come on, hang in there, Sara.
Hang in there.

229
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:45,550
- Don't worry, died once.
Wasn't a fan.

230
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,620
- We need Gideon's
medical capabilities

231
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:50,650
to extract the bullet
and repair any internal damage.

232
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:53,320
- If we merge, we can use
firestorm's nuclear energy

233
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:55,630
to repair the time drive
and get Gideon back online.

234
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:56,860
- Brilliant.

235
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:02,370
- What's happening?

236
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,200
- Whatever fried the ship
must've done the same thing

237
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,340
to our quantum splicer,
like an emp.

238
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,970
- Which explains
why Raymond is stuck

239
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:09,840
in a miniaturized state.

240
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,040
- Jax...
- I'll find another way

241
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,680
to get Gideon online,
you just...

242
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,710
You just hang in there.

243
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,780
- Jax...

244
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,780
It was rip.

245
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:21,250
- What?
No, no, no, that's not possible.

246
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,790
- The legion must've found
some way to turn him.

247
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,460
- No, they could never...

248
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:29,090
- well, apparently, they have,
but our mission remains clear.

249
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,100
We must save Washington.
- And Rory.

250
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,730
- That was implied.

251
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:35,900
- Whatever the legion's done
to rip, we gotta get him back.

252
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:40,070
- Jax,
I'm putting you in charge.

253
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:41,970
- Well... me?
But, i...

254
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:43,970
- you got this.

255
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,250
- Sara?
Sara!

256
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,580
Grey, do something.
- She's still alive.

257
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:53,050
I'll try to stabilize her,
but we need Gideon.

258
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,620
- I don't know how
to be a captain, man.

259
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,790
- Yes, you do, Jefferson.

260
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,630
Okay.

261
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,700
Sara's still hanging on,
and grey's taking care of her.

262
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,400
And she's put me in charge.

263
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,100
Me and mini ray will work on
restoring the ship's power.

264
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,870
You and Amaya
need to rescue Washington

265
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,340
so he can cross the Delaware.

266
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,940
- Saving a president, a nation,
and Christmas.

267
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:21,910
- And Rory.
- That was implied.

268
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:25,620
- Listen, rip's out there too,
but his brain's been scrambled

269
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,650
by the legion, so we need
to bring him back.

270
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:29,220
- I mean,
if he's been brainwashed, then...

271
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:33,990
- no, we gotta save him.
No matter what it takes.

272
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,530
- Okay.

273
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,900
- I'm gonna find
that skinny little englishman

274
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,240
and strangle him to death.

275
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,240
You take the front,
I take the rear.

276
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,280
- If we face them now, they will
surely kill us, private.

277
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,910
- They're gonna kill us anyway.

278
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:56,710
- If the British wanted us dead,
they'd have done it already.

279
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,350
When we reach camp, I will talk
to their commanding officer

280
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:01,250
and arrange a prisoner exchange.

281
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,950
There are rules to war.

282
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,720
- Yeah, kill or be killed.

283
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,960
- British high command
will treat us honorably,

284
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,490
just as I treat prisoners,
with honor.

285
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,130
- Now I know why
Franklin's on the $100 bill.

286
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:13,800
I bet you 100 yous you're wrong.

287
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,800
- Excuse me?

288
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,500
- Oh, forget it.

289
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,500
I hate Christmas.

290
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,110
- Wait, so rip became Phil,

291
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:23,140
and now he's rip again,
but evil?

292
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,980
- They went this way.

293
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,080
- How do you know that?
Are you using

294
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,340
your magical animal powers?

295
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,880
- No, I figured that out
by following

296
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,310
Rory's trail of trash.

297
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,980
- Huh.

298
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,350
Smell that fresh air?

299
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,590
We're outside.
Back on the ship,

300
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,290
you said you wanted to
be outside.

301
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:37,720
- It's kind of hard
to appreciate the scenery

302
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,820
when you're tracking
George Washington at the Eve

303
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:41,160
of the American revolution.

304
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,160
- Good point.

305
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,090
We are not in Kansas anymore.

306
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,700
- Wait, I know that one.

307
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,900
That's from a movie called
"the wizard of oz."

308
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,430
- Right, when I was a kid,
I would run out of the room

309
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,270
any time the flying monkeys
come on.

310
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:54,470
I do not care
for flying monkeys.

311
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:57,740
- I saw that with Bobby padusky.

312
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:00,880
- Wait a minute,
so there was life before Rex?

313
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,450
What was dating like in 1939?

314
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:04,310
- Dating?

315
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,320
You mean courting?

316
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,850
- Okay, courting, yeah.

317
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:09,620
- Well, Bobby was always
the perfect gentleman.

318
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,760
I never got to see the end
of "the wizard of oz" though.

319
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,820
- He got freaked out
by the flying monkeys too, huh?

320
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,190
- No, Hitler invaded Poland,

321
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:17,330
and the jsa had to
ship out to Europe.

322
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:20,330
Hitler ruins everything.

323
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:22,630
- Okay, the time core's
inside the engine room,

324
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,440
but with the power off,
I can't get past

325
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,640
the door security.
- This is where I come in.

326
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,270
I'll go through the main duct,
take a left at this l-bracket,

327
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,910
this vent opens
into the engine room,

328
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,140
where I can flip the breaker.

329
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,440
I get that rip
is now somehow evil,

330
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:34,780
but does he really
have to try to kill

331
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,010
Washington on Christmas?

332
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,310
- Any progress?

333
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,520
- No, we're working on it.

334
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,650
How's Sara?

335
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:41,920
- I'm afraid she can't
wait any longer.

336
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,820
We need to remove
the bullet now.

337
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:44,820
- Okay.

338
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:49,160
- Uh, guys, what was that?

339
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,130
- Someone's at the door.

340
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,760
- Heave!

341
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,740
Put your backs into it!
Heave!

342
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,540
- It's rip.
He's trying to get in.

343
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,770
- And thanks to his emp,
every weapon on this ship

344
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,270
has been rendered useless.

345
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,310
No doubt the legion
has tasked him with recovering

346
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:07,680
our fragment of the spear.

347
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,710
- I'll handle rip.
You operate on Sara.

348
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,580
- Damn it, Jefferson,
I'm a physicist, not a doctor.

349
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:14,620
- And I'm a mechanic,
not a captain.

350
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,620
So I guess we're both
trying out new things today.

351
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:23,890
- So what's dating like in 2017?
You still go to the movies?

352
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,430
- Uh, sure, but, you know,
you gotta work up to it.

353
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:28,130
Two hours is
a big-time commitment.

354
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:29,900
- It is?
- Yeah, nowadays,

355
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,470
we got dating down to a science.

356
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:33,470
There's an app on your phone.
If you like somebody,

357
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:35,010
you swipe right.
If you don't, you swipe left.

358
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:37,670
And if you both swipe right,
you send each other a message.

359
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,840
- So you use a telephone
to find a wife?

360
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:41,480
- Wife?
No, no wife.

361
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,950
People don't date for marriage.

362
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:46,020
They just date for,
you know, fun.

363
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,180
- Fun.

364
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:49,390
- Okay, future history lesson.

365
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:51,620
Back in the 1960s,
there was a social movement

366
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,360
called the sexual revolution
where women

367
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,630
could have sex for pleasure.

368
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:59,100
Nowadays, relationships
are just... Chill.

369
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,960
- Chill?
- Yeah.

370
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,940
- We're being watched.

371
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:10,870
- You sure you heard someone?
- Shh.

372
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,140
- I mean, I hear
the sound of rushing water,

373
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:17,980
but I don't think
anyone else is out here.

374
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,750
- aah!

375
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:22,990
- Hessians.

376
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:24,660
That's cool.

377
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,140
- Nate?

378
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,510
- The hessians must've planned
to camp here for the night.

379
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,920
- Oh, I'm so cold.
I've never been so cold.

380
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,420
Why aren't you cold?
- 'Cause I'm stronger than you.

381
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:59,120
And I summoned the ashe
of a seal as I dove in.

382
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,660
- Seals are cute.

383
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,360
- You're suffering
from hypothermia.

384
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,900
You're not thinking clearly.

385
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,060
- You're not thinking clearly.
You're the one

386
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:09,730
who doesn't think
seals are cute.

387
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:13,140
Whatever, I'm tired of
arguing with you.

388
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,300
I'm just gonna take a nap.

389
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,340
- No, Nathaniel, stay awake.

390
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,180
- I'm awake.
I'm up.

391
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,940
No, I'm not.

392
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:23,250
- You need skin on skin contact.

393
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,950
My body heat will keep you warm.

394
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:28,550
- This isn't how I pictured
getting you naked.

395
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:30,190
- You pictured getting me naked?

396
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:32,090
- Mm-hmm.

397
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:34,760
- Nate?
Nate?

398
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,790
Nate.

399
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,630
- You're pretty.

400
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:45,200
And... and you're so warm.

401
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,940
You're so warm.

402
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:51,170
- For england!

403
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:53,310
Come on, you bastards, heave!

404
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:59,920
- And this is why
I avoided medical school.

405
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:03,990
All right, Martin,
hold it together.

406
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:06,520
You can do this.

407
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:09,290
You have to do this.

408
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,660
- Whoa, the ship looks
a lot different

409
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:15,400
when you're the size
of an action figure.

410
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,590
- mm, it's good to be home.

411
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:37,350
Fan out.

412
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,160
Kill anyone you find.

413
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,810
- Ooh, very clever.

414
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:38,180
Now, which one of my former
teammates could possibly

415
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:41,820
be fighting back, hmm?

416
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:44,450
Well, I believe
Ms. Lance is dead.

417
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,390
Professor Stein is
a little over the hill

418
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:47,760
for these sort of shenanigans,

419
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:54,200
and doctor Palmer is
a trifle too small.

420
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,900
Give it up, Jax!

421
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:00,270
I taught you everything
you know about the waverider.

422
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,480
There's nowhere to hide, Jax.

423
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:15,050
I know every nook and cranny
on this ship.

424
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:24,630
- General Washington,
as I live and breathe.

425
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:26,860
- Lieutenant general cornwallis.

426
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:29,570
I would've preferred to meet you
on the field of battle.

427
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:31,770
- I must give credit
where credit is due.

428
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:34,270
I have a new colonel
who's most impressive.

429
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:36,170
One might say
he's ahead of his time.

430
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:39,210
- If you two are done yapping,
I'd like my last meal.

431
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:42,810
- Take these men to my tent,
and have them well fed.

432
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,820
You'll both be hung
in the morning.

433
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:47,280
- Sounds exciting.
What'd I tell you, Georgie boy?

434
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:50,650
- I am an officer
in the continental army, sir.

435
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:53,520
You must treat me
as a prisoner of war

436
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:55,960
in a manner which is
befitting of my rank.

437
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,800
- This is not a war.
This is a rebellion.

438
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,360
And you will be hanged
for treason

439
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:03,670
against king George III.

440
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:06,140
- Wait, you mustn't punish him.

441
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,640
This man is only guilty
of following orders.

442
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,540
- I'm guilty of
a lot more than that.

443
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:13,540
- He will be returned
to his regiment tomorrow

444
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:15,280
with news of your death.

445
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,300
Is my underwear out there?

446
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:42,310
- You weren't wearing any.

447
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:44,740
That's embarrassing.

448
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,610
Just so you know,
that water was very cold,

449
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:48,780
so if you happened
to have sneaked a peek,

450
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,150
it's not
a fair representation of...

451
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:52,750
- Nate,
I wasn't looking down there.

452
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:56,190
- Because that would be
unprofessional.

453
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,820
- We'll wait for our clothes
to dry and then continue

454
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,990
tracking Rory and Washington.

455
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:02,290
- Wait.

456
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:04,460
You're gonna wait out there?

457
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:07,730
- It's warm by the fire.

458
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:10,230
- It's warmer in the tent.

459
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,100
- If you're implying
what I think you're implying,

460
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:15,440
you don't think
that's a little fast?

461
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,440
Even by your modern standards?

462
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,610
- No.

463
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:25,650
- I suppose,
after all we've been through,

464
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:27,780
a kiss would seem quaint.

465
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:30,350
- It would seem old-fashioned.

466
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:41,330
- Mr. Jackson!

467
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:43,830
- Man, this guy's really
starting to piss me off.

468
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,840
- You can't run forever,
Mr. Jackson.

469
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:08,490
Hmm, something tells me
I'm getting warmer.

470
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:14,300
- nope, colder.

471
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:19,140
- Man, the legion really must've
fried your brain.

472
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,800
I bet you couldn't even
find your own ass

473
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:22,840
with both hands
and a flashlight.

474
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:26,240
- I don't want to hurt you, Jax.

475
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,380
- Yeah, says the guy
who shot Sara.

476
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,480
- A small price to pay
for the spear of destiny,

477
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,120
don't you think?

478
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:36,620
Imagine the power we would wield
if we reunited the fragments.

479
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:39,360
- You mean eobard thawne.
You're just his errand boy.

480
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,160
- It's a job that the legion
will reward me handsomely for,

481
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,760
as they would you.

482
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,700
- You think you can bribe me?

483
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:46,960
I'm not a traitor like you.

484
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:48,500
There's nothing
you could offer me.

485
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,700
- What,
not even your father's life?

486
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:54,000
Think about it, Jax.

487
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:58,210
The spear allows us
to rewrite reality.

488
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:00,910
Now, if you were to help me,
your father no longer

489
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:02,710
has to ship off to battle.

490
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:06,250
He would no longer
have to die in that ambush.

491
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:08,180
Your mother would no longer
be a widow, and you...

492
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:09,920
- the only way
you're getting that spear

493
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,060
is by prying it
from my cold, dead hands.

494
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,690
- Oh, well, that works too.

495
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:27,570
- When they change shifts,
I'm gonna bust us out of here.

496
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:29,240
- Are you really
so anxious to die?

497
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,240
I argued for your life,
Mr. Rory.

498
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,640
- That's why
I'm taking you with me.

499
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:34,980
- I'd rather die a gentleman

500
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:37,550
than return to mount Vernon
a scoundrel.

501
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:39,750
I trust that I may
depend on you to deliver this

502
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,690
to my wife, Martha?

503
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:45,760
Consider it a last request.

504
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,930
- Listen, you fop.
You can give it to her yourself.

505
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:52,600
Or are you too much of a pansy?

506
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,930
- I've been a soldier
since I was 20 years old,

507
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:58,840
but our cause
is the cause of all men:

508
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,000
To be treated equally,
regardless

509
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:03,410
of hereditary privilege.

510
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:05,440
We must prove to the world
that you don't need

511
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,180
a title to be a gentleman.

512
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:11,880
The British may be dishonorable,
but I am not.

513
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,980
By my death,
I will prove to the crown

514
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:16,190
what it means to be an American.

515
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:20,160
- You don't know the first thing
about being an American.

516
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:25,430
We're misfits, outcasts,
and we're proud of it.

517
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:28,360
If they attack in formation,
we pop them off from the trees.

518
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:31,870
If they challenge you to a duel,
you raid their camp at night.

519
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:34,440
And if they're gonna hang you,
you fight dirty

520
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,670
and you never, ever give up.

521
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,180
That's the American way.

522
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,880
What's it gonna be, George?

523
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,830
- Hi.
- Hi.

524
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:02,700
How long were we asleep?

525
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,000
- Maybe an hour?

526
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,370
- An hour?
- Yeah.

527
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:07,740
- What about general Washington
and Rory?

528
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:10,610
- All right, slow down.

529
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:11,880
- We have to go.

530
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,040
- I'm up,
just need to get dressed,

531
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:18,050
unless you think we
have time for, you know...

532
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:21,580
We have a job to do.

533
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:27,490
- Okay,
please don't let this kill me.

534
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,600
- Ah, you managed
to turn on the auxiliary power,

535
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,230
Mr. Jackson.
Well done.

536
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,770
- Hey, come on, man.

537
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:39,340
You're captain rip hunter.

538
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,600
- The man who recruited
a bunch of reject super heroes

539
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:43,140
to not save his family?

540
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:46,410
Don't tell me you miss
that self-righteous idiot.

541
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:49,180
- This isn't you.

542
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,710
Whatever the legion's done
to turn you

543
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,920
into their puppet, you...

544
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,580
- captain rip hunter
was the puppet!

545
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:56,890
First of the time masters,
and then to some misguided duty

546
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:58,720
to protect history.

547
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,690
Can't you see, Jax?

548
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:03,930
My new allies, they freed me.

549
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:08,930
Looks like this will be
your last Christmas.

550
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:12,800
- Wait, I know where
the piece of the spear is.

551
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:16,340
- Hmm.
Smart play.

552
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:19,840
Show me.

553
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:37,590
- Oh, rats.

554
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:44,270
- You're a good man, rip.

555
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,970
Even when you disappeared,
we carried on

556
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:47,400
because that's what you wanted.

557
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:49,210
- No, because the old rip
was a fool for believing

558
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:52,540
that time is worth saving,
and you were even bigger fools

559
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,840
for believing him.

560
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:56,810
Now, my Patience
is wearing thin.

561
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,650
Where's the spear fragment?

562
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:01,850
- In the same place you left it.

563
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:03,990
- Humph.

564
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:06,760
I think I'll let you
do the honors.

565
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,000
- oh, you.

566
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:22,610
I underestimated you, Jax.

567
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,640
And I won't
make that mistake again.

568
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,970
Aw.

569
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:56,740
Well, I'm sorry to interrupt
this tender moment.

570
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:14,390
- Get away from her.
- Not another step.

571
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:19,300
Now, one last time,
where's the piece of the spear?

572
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,800
Don't make me ask you again.

573
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:27,140
- I'm not telling you nothing.

574
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,140
Very well.

575
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:32,610
There's no reason both of you
have to die tonight.

576
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:35,680
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

577
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,650
The piece of the spear's
inside your telescope.

578
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:41,820
Now just... just let her go.

579
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:44,150
Rip.

580
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,860
Rip, it's Sara.

581
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:49,560
Come on, it's Sara.

582
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:59,100
- you say her name as if
she's supposed to matter to me.

583
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:02,810
She doesn't.

584
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:15,050
- no, no, no, no, no.
Sara, Sara.

585
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:37,810
- honest to a fault, Jax.

586
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,980
Jefferson?

587
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:49,250
- I told him.

588
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:53,120
I told him where to find
the piece of the spear.

589
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,130
He just killed her anyway.

590
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:57,790
- Where's Raymond?

591
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,760
- It's too late.

592
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:02,570
- Where are you going?

593
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:04,830
- I'm gonna find rip,
and I'm gonna kill him.

594
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,070
- No, Jefferson, wait.

595
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:07,740
Raymond, if you can hear me,

596
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,110
you must get
the main power online.

597
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:12,880
Without Gideon,
I can't save her.

598
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:16,080
- This is why we have
a chore wheel!

599
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:29,060
Whoa!

600
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:33,060
Whoa, that is a long way down,

601
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:34,730
but you weren't captain

602
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:37,100
of the varsity diving team
for nothing.

603
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,100
Oh, man.

604
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,800
Three, two, one.

605
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,980
One!
Come on.

606
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,240
Whoa!
Aah!

607
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:49,850
Yes!
Ha!

608
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:52,680
- Hello, professor,
how can I be of assistance?

609
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,080
- Gideon, thank god.

610
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:56,050
Ms. Lance is, uh,
how shall I put this...

611
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:57,050
- Dead?

612
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:58,590
- Delicate, as always.

613
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:01,190
- Luckily, her brain cells
are still functioning.

614
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:04,460
Let's see what I can do,
shall we?

615
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:08,230
- Um, guys?
A little help here?

616
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:11,030
Guys?
Hello?

617
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:15,710
- Any last words?

618
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:19,680
- In fact, I've learned
a new word from my private.

619
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,680
- Kaboom.

620
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:33,290
- Take them down!

621
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:36,290
- All right.

622
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:45,000
Come on, Georgie boy.

623
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:48,600
Whoa.

624
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:52,980
If you're expecting me to blink,
it's gonna be a long day.

625
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:55,650
- Oof!

626
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:00,320
- A gentleman
would stay and fight,

627
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,850
but as an American,
I suggest we run.

628
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:13,130
- don't move!

629
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,170
- you haven't got it in you.

630
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:18,730
- You didn't have to kill her.

631
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:21,840
Sara wasn't supposed to die,
not like that, not by you.

632
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:26,310
- There's no rhyme nor reason
to any of this, Jax.

633
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,840
History is war and slavery

634
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:29,710
and holding your dead son
in your arms.

635
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:32,450
There's no point
in protecting history,

636
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:35,380
so we might as well
just burn it all down.

637
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:37,050
I haven't got all day for this.

638
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:40,690
If you're gonna shoot me,
then, please, get on with it.

639
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:44,060
I will make it easier for you.

640
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,140
No?

641
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:55,670
Well, it's just as I thought.

642
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:58,010
You're weak.

643
00:33:58,010 --> 00:34:01,240
Just like your old captain.

644
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:03,610
- Don't.

645
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,750
- Sara?

646
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,550
What?

647
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:10,990
- Gideon and Stein saved me.

648
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:15,290
It looks like rip put together
a pretty good team.

649
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:16,860
Will you put the gun down, Jax?

650
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,030
- No.

651
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:20,230
- I think you should
listen to your friend.

652
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:21,630
- Shut up!

653
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:23,330
He's with the legion now.

654
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:26,470
The rip we know is gone.

655
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:30,910
- You know what day it is, Jax?

656
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:34,180
It's December 25th.

657
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:37,350
It's Christmas.

658
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:41,480
It's when we remember
to be our best selves.

659
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:44,420
- Why are you protecting him?

660
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:48,020
- I'm not protecting him.

661
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:50,260
I'm protecting you.

662
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:53,800
- gah.

663
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:59,270
- Speaking of
Christmas miracles,

664
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:01,600
the British are coming.

665
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:17,390
- To fighting like an American.

666
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:19,520
- I always do.

667
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:25,160
Ah, it's not bad.

668
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,030
Listen, Georgie,

669
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:29,570
I got some thoughts on
the criminal justice system...

670
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:30,800
- this is last of them.

671
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,570
You should be back
to a fair fight now.

672
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:34,840
- Your troops are waiting for
you outside, general Washington.

673
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,670
- I don't understand
much of what I've seen,

674
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:40,480
but the world is changing.

675
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,350
- And you are
no small part of that.

676
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:45,480
- Sir.

677
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:48,480
- Well, Georgie, it's...
It's been a pleasure.

678
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:52,760
But, uh...

679
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,060
Mm.

680
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:58,360
Oh, uh, you can deliver
this love letter yourself.

681
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,660
- This is no love letter.

682
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:03,500
It's a battle strategy.

683
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,300
I wanted to ensure my men
would receive it

684
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,340
in the event of my death.

685
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,800
The hessians will be receiving

686
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:10,510
a Christmas surprise
this evening.

687
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:12,410
- Ah, you sneaky bastard.

688
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:14,940
You're not such
a gentleman after all.

689
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:17,450
- Your rebel spirit,
your steadfastness,

690
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:21,580
your crass yet effective
use of language,

691
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:25,020
you, Mr. Rory,
represent the best

692
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:28,260
of what our new nation can be.

693
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:31,330
- Yes, yes, I do.

694
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:32,330
All right.

695
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,400
- Gideon,
is the American revolution

696
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,700
back on track?

697
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,740
- Yes,
history has been restored.

698
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,340
Though there is now

699
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:43,810
a statue in the nation's capital

700
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:45,440
that bears
a striking resemblance

701
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,180
to Mr. Rory.

702
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:56,320
- So, how you feeling, captain?

703
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,050
- Good, considering.

704
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:02,190
- Well,
it's good to have you back.

705
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:05,900
And I think I'm just about done
being in charge for a while.

706
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,560
- Oh, I don't know.

707
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:09,770
I think you did
a pretty good job.

708
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:11,970
- I told rip where to find
the piece of the spear.

709
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:13,040
I...

710
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,140
How do you do it?

711
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:20,440
How do you make the right choice
even when there isn't one?

712
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:28,320
- you remember the mission.

713
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,560
And what you're fighting for.

714
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,960
And you try to hold on
to your humanity.

715
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,590
- And surround yourself
with people

716
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,660
who remind you of that,

717
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,900
even in your darkest hour.

718
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:50,440
- Gah!
- Whoa!

719
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,870
- Whoo!

720
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,710
- well, would you care
to do the honors?

721
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,780
You certainly know your way
around a knife.

722
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:02,750
- Well, the league
never covered poultry,

723
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:04,450
but I'll give it a shot.

724
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:06,160
- Ouch!

725
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,690
- Whoa!

726
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:09,690
- I'm certainly glad
to be human sized again.

727
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:11,330
- Man,
it's good to have you back.

728
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:14,600
This Christmas dinner idea?
It might be your best one yet.

729
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,930
It makes it feel
kind of like home.

730
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:18,270
- Yeah, right down
to the drunk uncle.

731
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:21,470
- Careful, haircut.
I'm your forefather now.

732
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:24,510
- That's true.
- Hey, I got you a gift.

733
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:27,110
- Ah.

734
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:29,110
- Dude, the hell?

735
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:31,250
- A rat.

736
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:32,620
- We made friends.

737
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:34,180
I got you something too.
- No, no, no, no, no.

738
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:36,220
If that's a mouse,
then I'm good, homie.

739
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:43,160
- hey,
I had the fabrication room

740
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,590
working overtime on this.
- Nathaniel...

741
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,330
- What?
Can't one teammate get another

742
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:49,270
a perfectly meaningless gift?

743
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:50,530
- Is this meaningless?

744
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,670
- I don't know, maybe,
maybe not.

745
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:55,100
- Look, I'm glad
last night happened.

746
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:56,910
It was fun.
- It was a lot of fun.

747
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:59,540
- But I still think teammates
shouldn't fraternize.

748
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,550
- I totally agree.

749
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:05,410
- This is what
you wanted, right?

750
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:08,080
I mean, you said
the future was "chill."

751
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:12,890
- Me,
I am the ambassador of chill.

752
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:15,090
Merry Christmas, Amaya.

753
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:17,860
- yeah.

754
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:31,370
- All right, merry Christmas,
happy holidays,

755
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:35,910
and whatever people say
who exist outside the timeline.

756
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:39,720
Now, I know that
it may seem like

757
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:42,120
we don't have
anything to celebrate.

758
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,620
Rip's been brainwashed
and took our piece

759
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:46,620
of the spear of destiny.

760
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:50,730
There's a monument
in Washington D.C. to Rory.

761
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:55,200
But... We saved America,

762
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,730
and we're gonna save rip

763
00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:00,770
and get back
the rest of the spear,

764
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:05,310
because as powerful
as the legion may be,

765
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:08,910
they don't have this.

766
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:10,880
Family.

767
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:15,150
And we all know
nobody fights like family.

768
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:17,150
- Here, here.

769
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:18,150
- Cheers.

770
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,360
All: To family.

771
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:43,250
- Greg, move your head.
