1
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:10,051
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

2
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:57,534
<i>( birds chirping )</i>

3
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:33,027
I'll give you one try, girl.

4
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,615
Kill me and you're free.

5
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:41,619
But if I live,
I'll break both your hands.

6
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:45,582
Go on, hit me.

7
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:48,334
<i>Hit me hard.</i>

8
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,096
Sulk all you want.

9
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:02,849
The truth is,
you're lucky.

10
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:06,728
You don't want to be
alone out here, girl.

11
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:09,564
Someone worse than me
would find you.

12
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:11,566
There's no one
worse than you.

13
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:13,818
Ha, you never knew
my brother.

14
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:16,279
He once killed a man
for snoring.

15
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,698
There's plenty
worse than me.

16
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:21,409
There's men who like
to beat little girls,

17
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:23,453
men who like
to rape them.

18
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,872
I saved your sister
from some of them.

19
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,750
You're lying.

20
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,877
Ask her, if you
ever see her again.

21
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,795
Ask her who
came back for her

22
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,715
when the mob
had her on her back.

23
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,843
They would have
taken her every which way

24
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:41,804
and left her there
with her throat cut open.

25
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,312
Is that the Blackwater?

26
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,814
The Blackwater?

27
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,108
Where do you think
I'm taking you?

28
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:58,655
Back to King's Landing
to Joffrey and the queen.

29
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,824
Fuck Joffrey.
Fuck the queen.

30
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,660
That's the Red Fork.

31
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,245
I'm taking you
to the Twins.

32
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,248
But why?

33
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,960
Because your mother
and brother will be there

34
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:14,295
and they'll pay me for you.

35
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:18,591
Why would they be
at the Twins?

36
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:22,512
( chuckles )
Those outlaws you love
so much never told you?

37
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:25,139
The whole countryside
is yapping about it.

38
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:29,727
Your uncle is marrying
one of the Frey girls.

39
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,562
So quit trying
to bash my skull in

40
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:34,691
and we might
just make it there
in time for the wedding.

41
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,784
( horses neighing )

42
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,752
Men who fight for gold
have neither honor
nor loyalty.

43
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:56,629
<i>They cannot be trusted.</i>

44
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:59,590
Jorah:
<i>They can be trusted to kill</i>
<i>you if they're well paid.</i>

45
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,884
<i>The Yunkish</i>
<i>are paying them well.</i>

46
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,720
You know these men?

47
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:06,389
Only by the broken swords
on their banners.

48
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:09,183
They're called
the Second Sons.

49
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:12,145
A company led by
a Braavosi named Mero,

50
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:14,689
"The Titan's Bastard."

51
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:17,233
Is he more titan
or bastard?

52
00:05:17,316 --> 00:05:19,652
He's a dangerous man,
khaleesi.

53
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,863
They all are.

54
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:24,782
How many?

55
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:27,618
Barristan:
<i>2,000, Your Grace.</i>

56
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,162
<i>Armored and mounted.</i>

57
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:31,664
Enough to make
a difference?

58
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,879
It's hard to collect
wages from a corpse.

59
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:40,840
I'm sure the sellswords
prefer to fight for
the winning side.

60
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:42,717
I imagine you're right.

61
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,263
I'd like to talk
to the Titan's Bastard
about winning.

62
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:48,806
He may not agree
to meet.

63
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,475
He will.

64
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:54,520
A man who fights
for gold can't afford
to lose to a girl.

65
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:57,065
Barristan:<i> Your Grace,</i>
<i>allow me to present</i>

66
00:05:57,148 --> 00:06:00,151
<i>the captains</i>
<i>of the Second Sons--</i>

67
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:03,279
Mero of Braavos,

68
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:06,449
Prendahl na Ghezn,

69
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:07,742
and...

70
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:10,495
Daario Naharis.

71
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,417
You are the Mother
of Dragons?

72
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:20,463
I swear I fucked you once
in a pleasure house in Lys.

73
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:23,299
- Mind your tongue.
- Mero:<i> Why?</i>

74
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:25,676
I didn't mind hers.

75
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,888
She licked my ass
like she was born to do it.

76
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,390
( laughs )

77
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:34,268
You, slave girl,
bring wine.

78
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,604
We have no slaves here.

79
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:38,773
You'll all be slaves
after the battle

80
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:40,817
unless I save you.

81
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:45,113
Take your clothes off
and come and sit
on Mero's lap

82
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:46,823
and I may give you
my Second Sons.

83
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:49,617
Give me your Second Sons
and I may not have you gelded.

84
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:53,037
Ser Barristan, how many men
fight for the Second Sons?

85
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:55,581
Under 2,000, Your Grace.

86
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,166
We have more,
don't we?

87
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,627
Barristan:
<i>10,000 Unsullied.</i>

88
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,754
I'm only a young girl,
new to the ways of war,

89
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,798
but perhaps a seasoned
captain like yourself

90
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:07,301
can explain to me
how you propose
to defeat us.

91
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:10,346
I hope the old man
is better with a sword
than he is with a lie.

92
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:13,516
You have 8,000 Unsullied.

93
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,687
You're very young
to be a captain.

94
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,314
He's not a captain.
He's a lieutenant.

95
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,316
Even if your numbers
are right,

96
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,735
you must admit the odds
don't favor your side.

97
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,571
The Second Sons have faced
worse odds and won.

98
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:29,782
The Second Sons have
faced worse odds and run.

99
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,869
Or you could
fight for me.

100
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:35,663
( Mero laughs )

101
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:37,415
We've taken
the slavers' gold.

102
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:39,458
We fight for Yunkai.

103
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:42,837
- Daenerys:<i> I would pay</i>
<i>you as much and more.</i>
<i>- ( sniffs )</i>

104
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:45,923
Our contract
is our bond.

105
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,466
If we break our bond,

106
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,635
no one will hire
the Second Sons again.

107
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,722
Ride with me and you'll
never need another contract.

108
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:56,350
You'll have gold and castles
and lordships of your choosing

109
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:57,894
when I take back
the Seven Kingdoms.

110
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,605
You have no ships.
You have no siege weapons.

111
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:02,273
You have no cavalry.

112
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:04,734
A fortnight ago,
I had no army.

113
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,403
A year ago,
I had no dragons.

114
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,866
You have two days
to decide.

115
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:17,663
Show me your cunt.
I want to see if it's
worth fighting for.

116
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:21,292
( speaking Valyrian )

117
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,339
You seem to be
enjoying my wine.

118
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:28,841
Perhaps you'd like
a flagon to help you ponder.

119
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,760
Only a flagon?

120
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,678
And what are my brothers
in arms to drink?

121
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,431
- A barrel, then.
- Good.

122
00:08:35,514 --> 00:08:39,018
The Titan's Bastard
does not drink alone.

123
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:43,606
In the Second Sons,
we share everything.

124
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:46,192
After the battle,
maybe we'll all share you.

125
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,908
I'll come looking for you
when this is over.

126
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,788
Ser Barristan,

127
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:02,959
if it comes to battle,
kill that one first.

128
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,294
Gladly, Your Grace.

129
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:00,891
Half Robert,
half lowborn.

130
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,978
Show the boy
to his chambers.

131
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:07,690
<i>Have the maids draw him</i>
<i>a bath and find him</i>
<i>some decent clothes.</i>

132
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,901
I'll come visit you soon.

133
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,036
What do you mean
to do with him?

134
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,579
You know what I mean
to do with him.

135
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,789
Then why bathe him
and dress him in fine clothes?

136
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,709
If it needs to be done, do it.
Don't torture the boy.

137
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:29,045
Have you ever slaughtered
a lamb, my king?

138
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,713
No.

139
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:33,966
If the lamb
sees the knife,

140
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,052
she panics.

141
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,220
Her panic seeps
into her meat,

142
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,556
darkens it,
fouls the flavor.

143
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:42,808
You've slaughtered
many lambs?

144
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:46,145
And none have seen
the blade.

145
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:56,697

Melisandre's returned.

I didn't know
she'd been gone.

174

00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:44,263
She says there's power
in king's blood.

178
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:47,183
She's going to kill him.

179
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,517
Sacrifice him.

180
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,227
Forgive me, Your Grace,
I'm not a learned man,

181
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:53,606
but is there a difference
between kill and sacrifice?

182
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,316
The boy is your nephew.

183
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:57,610
What of it?
We're at war.

184
00:12:57,693 --> 00:13:00,821
Why should I spare the son
of some tavern slut

185
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:03,657
Robert bedded
one drunken night?

186
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:05,910
Because he has
your blood in his veins.

187
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,706
So did Renly.

188
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:12,791
Renly wronged you.

189
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,586
Renly declared himself
king when the throne
belonged to you.

190
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:18,255
He raised an army,
stole your bannermen.

191
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,382
This boy has
done you no harm.

192
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,052
- He's an innocent.
- How many boys live
in Westeros?

193
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:26,597
How many girls?
How many men?
How many women?

194
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,058
The darkness will devour
them all, she says.

195
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,018
The night that never ends.

196
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:32,895
Unless I triumph.

197
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,480
I never asked for this.

198
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:36,232
No more than I asked
to be king.

199
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:39,693
We do not choose
our destiny,

200
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:42,112
but we must do
our duty, no?

201
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:45,074
Great or small,
we must do our duty.

202
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:50,496
What's one bastard boy
against a kingdom?

203
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,668
Your Grace,

204
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:57,711
why did you come
to see me today?

205
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:00,422
I came to free you.

206
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:04,426
If you swear never
to raise your hand to
the Lady Melisandre again.

207
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,471
I swear it.

208
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,640
I can't swear never
to speak against her.

209
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:11,767
You have little regard
for your own life.

210
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,936
Quite little, Your Grace.

211
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,272
Verging on none.

212
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:19,984
You could have
freed me yesterday
or tomorrow,

213
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:22,695
but you came to me now
before this boy is put
to the knife

214
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:26,365
because you knew
I'd counsel restraint.

215
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:30,953
You came to hear me
say it because you
believe it yourself.

216
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,622
You're not a man
who slaughters innocents

217
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,041
for gain or glory.

218
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:42,923
When my son was five
he said to me,

219
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,384
"I don't ever
want to die."

220
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:48,470
I wanted to say to him,
"You won't, child.
You won't ever."

221
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:53,809
<i>I hated the idea</i>
<i>of him lying awake</i>
<i>in the dark, afraid.</i>

222
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,315
I think mothers and fathers
made up the gods

223
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:02,776
because they wanted
their children to sleep
through the night.

224
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,822
I saw a vision
in the flames.

225
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:11,827
A great battle
in the snow.

226
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,746
I saw it.

227
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:19,752
And you saw whatever
she gave birth to.

228
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:23,839
<i>I never believed,</i>
<i>but when you see the truth,</i>

229
00:15:23,922 --> 00:15:26,342
when it's right there
in front of you

230
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,761
as real as these iron bars,

231
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:32,056
how can you deny
her god is real?

232
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:38,687
- ( horse neighs )
- ( people chatting )

233
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,496
Little dragon bitch.
She talks too much.

234
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,039
You talk too much.

235
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,541
She won't talk so much
when she's choking on my cock.

236
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,586
8,000 Unsullied stand
between her and your cock.

237
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,214
( laughs )
My cock will find a way.

238
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:08,300
Tell him.
Is there any place
that my cock can't reach?

239
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,886
She'll tell me
whatever you pay her
to tell me.

240
00:16:10,969 --> 00:16:14,223
Daario Naharis, the whore
who doesn't like whores.

241
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:17,393
I like them very much.
I just refuse to pay them.

242
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:20,396
And I'm no whore,
my friend.

243
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,564
She sells her sheath
and you sell your blade.

244
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:25,317
- What's the difference?
- I fight for beauty.

245
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:26,360
For beauty?

246
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:28,278
We fight for gold.

247
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:32,491
The gods gave men
two gifts to entertain
ourselves before we die--

248
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:35,703
the thrill of fucking a woman
who wants to be fucked

249
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:38,831
and the thrill of killing
a man who wants to kill you.

250
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:40,416
You'll die young.

251
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,126
Prendahl:<i> What do we do</i>
<i>about the dragon girl?</i>

252
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:44,837
We can't beat 8,000 Unsullied
on the battlefield.

253
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,423
There won't be a battle.
And we don't have to deal
with her eunuchs.

254
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,216
We only have
to deal with her.

255
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:51,635
- She's well guarded.
- Mero:<i> Tonight's a new moon.</i>

256
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:55,806
One of us slips
into her camp past her
Unsullied and her knights.

257
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:59,393
Which one of us?

258
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:02,438
Close your eyes, love.

259
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:10,779
Three coins.

260
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,865
A coin from Meereen,

261
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:14,950
a coin from Volantis,

262
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:16,660
and a coin from Braavos.

263
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,495
The Braavosi
does the deed.

264
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,960
One for each
of us, darling.

265
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,838
No peeking.

266
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:45,230
Do you hear me?

267
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:48,776
Follow my voice.
I'm right here.

268
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,362
You have
something for me?

269
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,869
Valar morghulis.

270
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,291
<i>( knock at door )</i>

271
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,679
( sighs )

272
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,518
Lady Sansa.

273
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:25,771
You look very handsome,
my lord.

274
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:27,356
Oh, yes.

275
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,691
The husband
of your dreams.

276
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,736
But you do
look glorious.

277
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,618
Perhaps we could have
a moment alone.

278
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:41,328
Do you mind?

279
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:46,583
Podrick, could you escort
Lady Stark's handmaiden?

280
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,892
My lady,

281
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,562
I want you to know

282
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,689
I didn't ask for this.

283
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:11,775
I hope I will not
disappoint you, my lord.

284
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,235
No, don't.

285
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:16,238
You don't have to speak to me
as a prisoner anymore.

286
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,407
You won't be a prisoner
after today.

287
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,409
You'll be my wife.

288
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:24,913
I suppose
that's a different
kind of prison.

289
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,500
I just wanted to say--

290
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:32,337
I'm just trying
to say very badly--

291
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,924
I just--

292
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,969
just want to say
I know how you feel.

293
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:44,266
I doubt that
very much, my lord.

294
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,644
You're right.

295
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,855
I have no idea
how you feel.

296
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:52,441
And you have no idea
how I feel.

297
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:02,534
But I promise you
one thing, my lady.

298
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:06,163
I won't ever hurt you.

299
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,544
Do you drink wine?

300
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,922
When I have to.

301
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:18,425
Well, today you have to.

302
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,601
Margaery:
<i>You look radiant,</i>
<i>Your Grace.</i>

303
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:30,103
Radiant?
Why radiant?

304
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:32,022
It's the word
that came to mind.

305
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:33,982
( chuckles )

306
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,068
We're going
to be sisters soon.

307
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:38,570
We should be friends.

308
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:41,031
You're a musical girl,
aren't you?

309
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:43,784
I imagine you have
a lovely voice.

310
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:46,745
A better dancer
than a singer,
I'm afraid.

311
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:49,456
Ah, but you know the song
"The Rains of Castamere"?

312
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:52,960
Of course.
They play it so often
here at court.

313
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:56,004
So you know the story
of House Reyne of Castamere?

314
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,548
Not as well as you,
I'm sure.

315
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,884
House Reyne
was a powerful family.

316
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,135
Very wealthy.

317
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:04,471
The second wealthiest
in Westeros.

318
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:09,017
Aren't the Tyrells
the second wealthiest
family in Westeros now?

319
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,728
Of course,
ambitious climbers
don't want to stop

320
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,855
on the second highest rung.

321
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,692
If only you could take
that final step,

322
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,528
you'd see further
than all the rest.

323
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:22,698
You'd be alone with nothing
but blue sky above you.

324
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:25,867
So Lord Reyne
built a castle

325
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,869
as grand as Casterly Rock.

326
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,329
He gave his wife diamonds

327
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:31,873
larger than any
my mother ever wore.

328
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,209
And finally one day,

329
00:21:34,292 --> 00:21:36,670
he rebelled
against my father.

330
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:39,423
Do you know where
House Reyne is now?

331
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:40,882
Gone.

332
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,218
Gone.

333
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:45,554
A gentle word.

334
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,889
Why not say slaughtered?

335
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,851
Every man, woman,
and child

336
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:53,353
put to the sword.

337
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,439
I remember seeing
their bodies hanging

338
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:57,983
high above the gates
of Casterly Rock.

339
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:01,111
My father let them rot
up there all summer.

340
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:03,572
It was a long summer.

341
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:07,242
"And now the rains
weep o'er their halls,

342
00:22:07,325 --> 00:22:09,536
and not a soul to hear."

343
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,501
If you ever
call me sister again,

344
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:19,337
I'll have you strangled
in your sleep.

345
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,762
<i>( doors open )</i>

346
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,704
What are you doing?

347
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:54,372
Your father's gone.

348
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:57,375
As the father
of the realm,

349
00:22:57,459 --> 00:23:00,921
it is my duty
to give you away
to your husband.

350
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:25,463
You may now
cloak the bride

351
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:28,842
and bring her
under your protection.

352
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:45,734
<i>( light laughter )</i>

353
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,485
( snickers )

354
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:49,779
( laughter )

355
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:51,740
( laughter stops )

356
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,831
Could you...

357
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,797
Thank you.

358
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:15,597
Your Grace,
Your Grace,

359
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,974
<i>my lords, my ladies,</i>

360
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:21,269
<i>we stand here in the sight</i>
<i>of gods and men</i>

361
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:24,564
<i>to witness the union</i>
<i>of man and wife.</i>

362
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:28,818
<i>One flesh, one heart,</i>
<i>one soul,</i>

363
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:31,863
now and forever.

364
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:50,674
Have you ever
seen one like it?

365
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:53,802
I've never seen anything
like any of this.

366
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,637
Not in my life.

367
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,264
It's shocking, isn't it,

368
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:59,307
the first time
you encounter real wealth?

369
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:03,478
When I was your age,
I lived on one bowl
of stew a day.

370
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:06,481
And stew
is a kind word for it.

371
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:10,110
In Flea Bottom
we called them
bowls of brown.

372
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:14,447
We'd pretend that the meat
in them was chicken.

373
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:17,701
We knew
it wasn't chicken.

374
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:26,793
<i>( liquid pouring )</i>

375
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:32,173
Here, taste this.

376
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,843
You think I'm trying
to poison you?

377
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,658
That's good.

378
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,830
That's really good.

379
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:06,041
<i>Where do you think</i>
<i>it's from?</i>

380
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:07,709
I couldn't even guess.

381
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:09,586
Doesn't matter, does it?

382
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:11,546
It's the real thing
or it's not.

383
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:15,091
You only need a tongue
to tell the difference.

384
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:19,554
Go on,
have some more.

385
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,685
You still
don't trust it.

386
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,604
You think this
is all a mistake

387
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:30,648
and that you'll have
to pay somehow for
every bite you take.

388
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:33,109
That thought had
crossed my mind, yeah.

389
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:37,113
There are no mistakes.

390
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:39,199
Not for us.

391
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,619
I'm a mistake.

392
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:44,704
I'm only here because
my father grabbed my mother

393
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:46,581
instead of the girl
next to her in the tavern.

394
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:50,627
Your father chose
your mother because
the Lord of Light willed it.

395
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:53,463
He willed it so you
could be here right now

396
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:55,715
with a power inside you

397
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:58,760
you can't even begin
to understand.

398
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:03,765
And He brought me here
to draw it from you

399
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,975
and birth it
into the world.

400
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:11,064
We're both a part
of His plan.

401
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:13,650
He wants this for us.

402
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:16,903
No, He demands
this of us.

403
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,867
I don't understand.
This--

404
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,744
this doesn't seem
very religious.

405
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:27,497
According to whom?

406
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,667
The Silent Sisters?

407
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,544
With their stern looks,

408
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:36,214
muzzled mouths,
and dried-up cunts?

409
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:40,093
What have their gods
done for you?

410
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:42,053
Hmm?

411
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:43,805
When you pray to them,

412
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:46,057
what's their answer?

413
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,768
A god is real
or he's not.

414
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:52,856
You only need eyes
to see.

415
00:28:56,776 --> 00:29:00,155
Death is coming
for everyone and everything.

416
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:03,199
A darkness that will
swallow the dawn.

417
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:08,329
And we can stop it,
you and I.

418
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:34,689
( breathing heavily )

419
00:29:34,772 --> 00:29:38,485
Let me show you
what you have inside you.

420
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:40,737
Come fight death with me.

421
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:46,910
( both moaning )

422
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:12,018
What are you doing?

423
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:17,106
You have to trust me.

424
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:41,881
What--?

425
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:44,008
Get it away.

426
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,552
Get it off me.

427
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:48,429
Don't fight, don't fight.
They won't take much.

428
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:51,224
Why are you
doing this?

429
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:55,436
I told you there's power
in the blood of kings.

430
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,438
And you have so much blood.

431
00:30:57,522 --> 00:31:00,650
No. No, no, no, no!

432
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,737
Not there.
Not there!

433
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:12,245
You can blame Ser Davos.

434
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:15,123
He didn't believe in
the power of king's blood.

435
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,168
He wanted a demonstration.

436
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:22,630
Gendry:<i> Please.</i>
<i>Please, Your Grace.</i>

437
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:25,091
<i>My lord!</i>

438
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:44,986
( cries out )

439
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:03,254
The usurper Robb Stark.

440
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:08,885
The usurper Balon Greyjoy.

441
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:15,767
The usurper
Joffrey Baratheon.

442
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:21,898
-<i> ( music playing )</i>
<i>- ( people chatting )</i>

443
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:37,205
So their son
will be your nephew.

444
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,707
After you're wed
to Cersei, of course.

445
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:44,337
And you will be
the king's stepfather

446
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,714
and brother-in-law.

447
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,424
When you marry the king,

448
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:52,387
<i>Joffrey's mother will</i>
<i>become his sister-in-law</i>

449
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:56,557
<i>and your son</i>
<i>will be Loras' nephew?</i>

450
00:32:56,641 --> 00:33:00,186
Grandson?
I'm not sure.

451
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:02,772
But your brother will become
your father-in-law.

452
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:05,316
That much
is beyond dispute.

453
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:21,916
( snorts )

454
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:28,005
Will you pardon me,
my lord?

455
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:32,009
Of course. Of course.
En-- enjoy.

456
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:39,767
Perhaps you could talk
to your bride-to-be instead.

457
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,689
I've got a lifetime for that.

458
00:33:56,033 --> 00:33:57,952
Stay.

459
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:08,629
You seem rather drunk.

460
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:11,549
Rather less
than I plan to be.

461
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:14,510
Isn't it a man's duty to be
drunk at his own wedding?

462
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:16,012
Tywin:
This isn't about
your wedding.

463
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:18,473
Renly Baratheon
had a wedding.

464
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:20,516
Your wife needs a child,

465
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,561
a Lannister child,
as soon as possible.

466
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:26,689
- And?
- If you're going
to give her one,

467
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:28,733
you need to perform.

468
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:31,527
What did you once call me?

469
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:33,863
A drunken little
lust-filled beast.

470
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:36,741
- More than once.
-<i> There you have it.</i>

471
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:38,659
Nothing to worry about.

472
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,995
Drinking and lust,

473
00:34:41,078 --> 00:34:43,581
no man can match me
in these things.

474
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:46,959
I am the god
of tits and wine.

475
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:50,588
I shall build
a shrine to myself

476
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:52,465
at the next brothel
I visit.

477
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:55,718
You can drink,
you can joke,

478
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:58,262
you can engage
in juvenile attempts

479
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:00,014
to make your father
uncomfortable,

480
00:35:00,097 --> 00:35:03,100
but you will do your duty.

481
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:43,724
Well...

482
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:49,438
My father once told me--

483
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:52,775
Nobody cares what
your father once told you.

484
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:17,091
Congratulations,
my lady.

485
00:36:17,174 --> 00:36:18,634
Thank you,
Your Grace.

486
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:21,429
Well, you've done it.
You've married a Lannister.

487
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,306
Soon you'll have
a Lannister baby.

488
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:26,767
It's a dream come true
for you, isn't it?

489
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,644
What a glorious day.

490
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:29,937
Yes, Your Grace.

491
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:32,440
I suppose it doesn't
really matter

492
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:34,942
which Lannister
puts the baby into you.

493
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:38,070
Maybe I'll pay you
a visit tonight

494
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:40,698
after my uncle
passes out.

495
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:42,700
How'd you like that?

496
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:46,412
You wouldn't?

497
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:49,832
That's all right.
Ser Meryn and Ser Boros
will hold you down.

498
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,669
( claps )

499
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:55,796
Time for the bedding
ceremony.

500
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,048
<i>( cheering )</i>

501
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:58,716
There will be
no bedding ceremony.

502
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:01,719
Where's your respect
for tradition, Uncle?

503
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:03,262
Come, everyone.

504
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:05,514
Pick her up and carry her
to her wedding bed.

505
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:09,310
Get rid of her gown.
She won't be needing
it any longer.

506
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:12,313
Ladies, attend to my uncle.
He's not heavy.

507
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:14,148
There will be
no bedding ceremony.

508
00:37:14,231 --> 00:37:17,652
There will be
if I command it.

509
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:22,156
Then you'll be fucking
your own bride

510
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:25,493
with a wooden cock.

511
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,455
What did you say?

512
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:37,421
What did you say?!

513
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:40,800
I believe we can dispense
with the bedding, Your Grace.

514
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:45,680
<i>I'm sure Tyrion did not mean</i>
<i>to threaten the king.</i>

515
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:53,354
( laughs )

516
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:55,690
A bad joke, Your Grace.

517
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:59,485
Made out of envy
of your own royal manhood.

518
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:03,197
Mine is so small.

519
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,033
My poor wife won't
even know I'm there.

520
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:09,578
Your uncle is clearly
quite drunk, Your Grace.

521
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:11,914
Tyrion:
<i>I am.</i>

522
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:14,333
Guilty.

523
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:17,211
But--

524
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:20,798
but it is my wedding night.

525
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:25,344
My tiny drunk cock
and I have a job to do.

526
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,890
Come, wife.

527
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:35,521
I vomited on a girl once

528
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:36,939
in the middle of the act.

529
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:38,691
Not proud of it.

530
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:41,569
But I think honesty
is important

531
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:44,030
between a man and wife,
don't you agree?

532
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:46,741
Come, I'll tell you
all about it.

533
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:48,743
Put you in the mood.

534
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,902
Is that wise,
my lord?

535
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:25,654
Tyrion, Sansa.

536
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:27,782
My name is Tyrion.

537
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:30,910
Is that wise, Tyrion?

538
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:38,209
Nothing was ever wiser.

539
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:52,389
Astoundingly long.

540
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:54,642
What?

541
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,393
Neck.

542
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:58,312
You have one.

543
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,817
How old are you exactly?

544
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,236
14.

545
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:13,244
Well, talk won't
make you any older.

546
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:23,712
My lord father
has commanded me

547
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:26,799
to consummate this marriage.

548
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:46,837
Stop.

549
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,382
I can't.

550
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:55,763
I could, I won't.

551
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:57,181
But your father--

552
00:41:57,264 --> 00:41:59,767
If my father wants
someone to get fucked,

553
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:02,311
I know where he can start.

554
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:09,401
I won't share your bed.

555
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:14,990
Not until you want me to.

556
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:20,412
What if I never
want you to?

557
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:33,592
And so my watch begins.

558
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:47,022
<i>( thuds )</i>

559
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:55,322

560
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:28,981
19?

561
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:30,232
Yes, Your Grace.

562
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:33,068
How can anyone
speak 19 languages?

563
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:36,655
It only took Your Grace
a year to learn Dothraki
reasonably well.

564
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:38,699
Yes, well, it was
either learn Dothraki

565
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:41,994
or grunt at my husband
and hope--

566
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:45,497
what do you mean
reasonably well?

567
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:49,793
Dothraki is difficult
for the mouth to master.

568
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:51,962
So guttural and harsh.

569
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:55,966
( speaking Dothraki )

570
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:03,724
<i>Athjahakar.</i>

571
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:06,185
Athjahaka.

572
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:08,729
Ath-ja-hakar.

573
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:11,148
Athjahakar.

574
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:15,944
Well, I suppose
I'm a bit out of practice.

575
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:19,323
Your High Valyrian
is very good, Your Grace.

576
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:22,576
The gods could not devise
a more perfect tongue.

577
00:44:22,659 --> 00:44:25,829
<i>It is the only proper</i>
<i>language for poetry.</i>

578
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:29,708
<i>( Missandei gasps )</i>

579
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:34,296
No screaming or she dies.

580
00:44:47,684 --> 00:44:48,936
What do you want?

581
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:51,897
You.

582
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:53,524
Let her go.

583
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:55,818
Don't scream,
lovely girl.

584
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:04,868
You were sent here
to kill me?

585
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:06,787
( chuckles )

586
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,705
So why haven't you?

587
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:10,207
I don't want to.

588
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:13,335
What do your captains
have to say about that?

589
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:15,838
You should ask them.

590
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:22,136
Why?

591
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:24,888
We had philosophical
differences.

592
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:27,307
- Over what?
- Your beauty.

593
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:30,394
<i>It meant more to me</i>
<i>than it did to them.</i>

594
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:32,312
You're a strange man.

595
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:34,398
I'm the simplest man
you'll ever meet.

596
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:35,774
I only do
what I want to do.

597
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:37,860
And this is supposed
to impress me?

598
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:40,195
Yes.

599
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:44,533
Why would I trust a man
who murders his comrades?

600
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:47,035
They ordered me
to murder you.

601
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,329
<i>I told them</i>
<i>I preferred not to.</i>

602
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:51,582
<i>They told me</i>
<i>I had no choice.</i>

603
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:53,834
I told them
I am Daario Naharis.

604
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:56,795
I always have a choice.

605
00:45:57,921 --> 00:46:00,799
They drew their swords

606
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:02,926
and I drew mine.

607
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:36,627
Will you fight for me?

608
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:45,344
Swear to me.

609
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:50,766
The Second Sons are yours
and so is Daario Naharis.

610
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:53,727
My sword is yours,
my life is yours,

611
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:56,480
my heart is yours.

612
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:04,279
<i>( door opens )</i>

613

614
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:16,875
You really
ought to knock.

615
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:19,419
I brought your breakfast.

616
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:55,122

( cawing )

620
00:48:36,913 --> 00:48:38,582
It's getting dark.

621
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:40,959
We could stay here
for the night.

622
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:42,878
( baby fussing )

623
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:03,607

625
00:49:07,944 --> 00:49:10,113
( stones clacking )

626
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:16,662
How hard can it be
to build a fire?

627
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:18,789
It doesn't matter.

628
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:21,625
Come under the furs.
We can keep each other warm.

629
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:36,682
<i>( baby fusses )</i>

630
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:42,938
He winked at me before.

631
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:47,984
- I doubt it.
- I saw him wink at me.

632
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:50,320
He blinked.

633
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:53,198
I suppose it's a rather
philosophical difference

634
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:55,283
between a wink
and a blink.

635
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:57,828
A what?

636
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:03,792
Well, I mean,
there's no real difference.

637
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:08,880
A wink is on purpose.

638
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,468
You thought of a name yet?

639
00:50:16,638 --> 00:50:20,016
It would be easier to refer
to him if he had a name.

640
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:23,437
Sometimes do you talk fancy
on purpose to confuse me?

641
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,939
What? No.

642
00:50:26,022 --> 00:50:28,817
This is just
the way I talk.

643
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:34,239
I'll build that fire.

644
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:44,750
Don't you think
he should have a name?

645
00:50:46,042 --> 00:50:49,212
I don't know
many boys' names.

646
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:50,714
Let's see,

647
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:52,799
there's Duncan,

648
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:55,969

Feldan,
Tristifer.

651
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:02,976
Craster.

652
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:04,936
Uh, yes.

653
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:07,647
Maybe that's not--

654
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:09,608
Mormont.

655
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:12,194
That's a lovely idea,

656
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:14,154
but Mormont's a last name.

657
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:17,073
Why is it a last name?

658
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:19,910
Well, it's a family name.

659
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:24,581
For instance,
I'm Samwell Tarly.

660
00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:26,666
Samwell is my birth name

661
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:30,170
and Tarly
is my family name.

662
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:34,758
You see?
So my father
is also a Tarly.

663
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:38,345
His name
is Samwell Tarly, too?

664
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:41,264
No, Randyll Tarly.

665
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:43,350
Randyll is a handsome name.

666
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:46,520
Please don't
name him Randyll.

667
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:52,526
Is your father
cruel like mine?

668

<i>( crows cawing )</i>

669
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:59,658

Don't go out there.

674
00:52:41,157 --> 00:52:42,993
I'll be back.

675
00:52:43,076 --> 00:52:45,203
I just want to look.
