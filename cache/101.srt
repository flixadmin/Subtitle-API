1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:07,880
The global mentality is moving toward 
free world trade and increased market liberalism.

2
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,540
A world full of opportunities.
A world where dreams can come true.

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,640
It sounds fantastic,
and it is fantastic.

4
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:20,780
For a very small percentage of us.

5
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:32,000
But for the vast, poor majority, the capitalist
 system only means one thing: death and suffering.

6
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:39,340
While we live out our days thoughtlessly,
and stuff ourselves with cheap food..

7
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:43,260
.. the poor people of the earth struggle
in factories.

8
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:47,720
Wages are forced down to the minimum,
while the work hours keep increasing.

9
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,560
Unionization is illegal,
 and the working conditions are intolerable.

10
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:56,540
Before applauding freedom,
we must remember one thing:

11
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:00,800
Our over consummating society stands
on the shoulders of the coffee beans from Peru.

12
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:07,120
We gorge on cheap food produced 
by underpaid children's hands from India-

13
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,860
Was it good?
-So good!

14
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:17,520
Should I change the title to:
Working conditions are inhumane?

15
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,700
No, it was good the way it was.
-Yeah?

16
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,580
Are there other things you thought of?

17
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,500
You know you wrote
 "gorge on cheap food" twice in a row?

18
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,680
Maybe you could change that.

19
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,540
No, that's the point. 
To write it twice.

20
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,960
I use repetition as a
literary tool to emphasize..

21
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,940
Was it good?
-Yeah, that was good.

22
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,440
Cleverly written.

23
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,440
I got a 5.

24
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,380
5+? Nice. Really good!

25
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,140
Eva, what did you get?

26
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,920
I don't want to talk about it.

27
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:21,700
The thing is, that Jonas is your boyfriend.
So you have to tell him everything.

28
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:25,340
Jonas tells me everything.
So I'll know anyway.

29
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,240
It's true.

30
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,900
Okay, yeah. 
I got a 4 minus.

31
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,340
You got a 4 minus?

32
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:38,040
That's bad.
-Yeah, yeah. You're good a a lot of other things.

33
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:44,620
You're able to dress yourself,
you can brush your teeth by yourself. Think of that.

34
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,600
Jonas, we're leaving.

35
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,740
Now?
-Yeah.

36
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,740
Where are you going?
-To Elias.

37
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,500
I'll call you later.
-Okay.

38
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,780
<i>[Phone is turned off..]</i>

39
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,440
Hello!
-Hey!

40
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,920
What's up?
-Nothing special, really.

41
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,320
Are you with Jonas?
-No, not now.

42
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,240
Weren't you going to Elias?

43
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,780
Yeah but that was a while ago.

44
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:43,260
Did you see Sara's picture?
I think she got fake lashes.

45
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,440
No!
-Yeah, check the picture on Facebook.

46
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,980
Have you heard they
started their bus already?

47
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:53,860
No.

48
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,800
One month into high school
and they started their bus.

49
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,240
With who?

50
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,480
With Rodrigues maybe,
they're calling themselves Papsi Max.

51
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,540
You know you can
just talk to her, right?

52
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,800
She doesn't bite.

53
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,560
Jonas is here.
I have to go.

54
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,900
What are you gonna do?

55
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:34,400
I tried to call you,
but you never answered your phone.

56
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,820
My battery was dead.

57
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,180
Can't you just charge it at home?
-I wasn't home.

58
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,460
Where were you then?

59
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,320
I was at Elias'.

60
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,440
Until now?

61
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:51,320
I talked to Isak. He said
you guys left Elias' a long time ago.

62
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:56,480
So many questions!
Isak left, I stayed.

63
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,280
Don't you trust me?

64
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,860
Don't you trust me?

65
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,200
Huh?

66
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,420
Why don't you trust me?

67
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:15,220
3+? You said you got a 4 minus!
-It's almost the same.

68
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,540
"Whoever has expelled.."
-Jonas!

69
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:25,400
".. must be blamed for their behavior."
-Jonas!

70
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:34,880
"A state one experiences"?
That was really sweet.

71
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,900
What do you think you're doing?
-A kiss.

72
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,260
What's your name?
-Ingrid.

73
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,740
Are you guys in the same class.
-1STA, yeah.

74
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,120
It costs 10 Kroner per ticket.

75
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,920
It'll be good.
Are you guys excited?

76
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,560
Hi!

77
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,560
Will you be at the show?

78
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,840
We're from the theater
group, and we want to have you!

79
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,340
What do you do at the theater group?

80
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,260
We have a pre-party tomorrow.
Are you going to the party?

81
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,060
You have to, everyone will go!

82
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:18,980
You're a first year. This is when you'll
lay the foundation for your social future for the next three years!

83
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,040
Wake up!

84
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,780
But if you want to be at
the pre-party, add me on Facebook.

85
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,020
Argentina etc..

86
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,980
I don't think anyone actually likes him.

87
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:45,040
When the teacher asks obvious questions..

88
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,360
Hey you..

89
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,260
Can't we go to the party?

90
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,520
Why?

91
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:55,000
Because the entire school is going.
And we are first years.

92
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:58,580
This is when we have to
lay the foundation for our social life.

93
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,800
Foundation for our social life?

94
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:05,860
Come on! It'll be so much fun!

95
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:12,040
I promise.
-Yeah okay, I'll come.

96
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,880
If.. Isak can come
to the cabin next week.

97
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:25,120
I know it would be just the two of us,
but Isak has nothing to do.

98
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,920
He'll just walk around,
completely by himself.

99
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,740
You can take a friend as well.

100
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,120
What do you say?

101
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:50,040
Okay, Isak will be allowed to come with.

102
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,160
Come with to what?

103
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,960
The cabin, man!

104
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,520
Cabin? I'm going to the cabin?

105
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,760
On one condition..

106
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,020
That you guys come to the party tomorrow.

107
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,340
We can't.

108
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,100
Why not?

109
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,000
Kindred Fever tickets.

110
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,880
I completely forgot!

111
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:13,620
Seriously, I didn't even remember it.

112
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,220
Hi! You came!

113
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,600
You can't ignore me forever.

114
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,940
We're bound to talk.

115
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,300
Ingrid..

116
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,340
I miss you.

117
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,560
Say something.

118
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,320
I would've lost the eyeliner.

119
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,840
You look like a slut.

120
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,880
She snapped.

121
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,040
NOORA

122
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:13,040
We have Spanish together. Noora.

123
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,580
Eva.

124
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:23,720
Girls who call other girls sluts
have 90% more chance to get chlamydia.

125
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,300
Seriously?

126
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,200
No.

127
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,020
But it would've
been cool if it were true.

128
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,980
Are you okay, or?

129
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,900
Yeah.. Yeah.

130
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,120
Are you sure?

131
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,920
Maybe..

132
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,720
Maybe I can get a friend?

133
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,900
Can you maybe get Chris?

134
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,380
Chris?

135
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:06,920
It was 40.000 Kroner.
I don't have that money!

136
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,740
It's toilet paper, Vilde! Toilet paper!

137
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,540
It's not that bad.

138
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,200
We're not going to use
that much toilet paper.

139
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:19,280
I don't mean to interrupt,
but I got Chris for you.

140
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:20,800
Here I am!

141
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,840
This is Chris.
-I am Chris.

142
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,300
Are you also called Chris?

143
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,440
Oh my god!

144
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,600
Twin names!
-Yeah, twin names!

145
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,160
We were actually in
the middle of something..

146
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,720
Yes, of course.

147
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,620
Come, we're going.

148
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,440
What happened?
We're not going to talk?

149
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,540
You! Where are you going?

150
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,180
Don't be a dick tease.
