1
00:01:59,755 --> 00:02:01,491
Okay, let's see
what we got here.

2
00:02:01,491 --> 00:02:03,427
Seen it. Seen it.

3
00:02:03,427 --> 00:02:05,726
Huh. What's this about?

4
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:07,596
<i>At the dawn...
dawn... dawn...</i>

5
00:02:07,596 --> 00:02:08,960
<i>dawn... dawn... dawn...</i>

6
00:02:22,316 --> 00:02:23,975
Ah. Here we go.

7
00:02:23,975 --> 00:02:25,614
<i>At the dawn of time,</i>

8
00:02:25,614 --> 00:02:29,189
<i>there was our gracious
and powerful creator,</i>

9
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,884
<i>Primus.</i>

10
00:02:31,884 --> 00:02:36,086
<i>To protect our universe,
he sacrificed his life force,</i>

11
00:02:36,086 --> 00:02:39,892
<i>transforming himself
into our planet,</i>

12
00:02:40,796 --> 00:02:42,664
<i>Cybertron.</i>

13
00:02:42,664 --> 00:02:45,436
<i>From within Cybertron's core,</i>

14
00:02:45,436 --> 00:02:49,000
<i>Primus birthed
the first Transformers</i>

15
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,311
<i>known as the Primes,</i>

16
00:02:52,311 --> 00:02:54,379
<i>the most powerful
Transformers,</i>

17
00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:58,251
<i>appointed to lead and protect
future generations.</i>

18
00:02:58,251 --> 00:03:02,981
<i>To assist them, Primus created
an entity of great power,</i>

19
00:03:02,981 --> 00:03:05,181
<i>the Matrix of Leadership.</i>

20
00:03:05,181 --> 00:03:08,184
The Matrix, there it is. Okay.
Good. Come on. Keep going.

21
00:03:08,184 --> 00:03:10,857
<i>With the Matrix
in the Primes' possession,</i>

22
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:17,369
<i>Cybertron's natural power source,
Energon, flowed in abundance,</i>

23
00:03:17,369 --> 00:03:20,735
<i>sustaining life
across the planet.</i>

24
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:27,379
<i>Attention! Unauthorized
movement detected in archival vault.</i>

25
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:28,677
<i>Sector J-3.</i>

26
00:03:28,677 --> 00:03:30,745
KDQ-12 to KDK-1.

27
00:03:30,745 --> 00:03:32,582
Breaching archives
in ten seconds.

28
00:03:32,582 --> 00:03:37,422
<i>For generations,
there was peace and prosperity,</i>

29
00:03:37,422 --> 00:03:40,854
<i>until the Matrix
of Leadership was lost,</i>

30
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:44,561
<i>causing Energon
to no longer flow.</i>

31
00:03:44,561 --> 00:03:48,730
Why does every legend
about the Matrix end right there?

32
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,996
One of these
has to say what happened.

33
00:03:50,996 --> 00:03:53,262
<i>Halt,
criminal! Prepare to be detained!</i>

34
00:03:53,262 --> 00:03:55,407
- Oh, hey there.
<i>- Halt, criminal! Prepare to--</i>

35
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:57,970
Uh-oh.

36
00:04:00,612 --> 00:04:02,106
- Freeze!
- Get down!

37
00:04:02,106 --> 00:04:04,680
Well, hello, guys.
I'm so glad you're here.

38
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,077
Which way is the exit?

39
00:04:06,077 --> 00:04:07,617
I must've taken a wrong turn.

40
00:04:07,617 --> 00:04:10,455
It's that defective mining bot,
Oreon Pix!

41
00:04:10,455 --> 00:04:11,918
- Orion Pax.
- Who cares?

42
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,953
We told you
to never come back here!

43
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:16,923
- Why are we all yelling?
- I'm gonna smash you!

44
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,596
Hold on. Whoa, whoa, hold on.
No need for violence.

45
00:04:19,596 --> 00:04:23,226
How about this: I run away,
you chase me. We play that game. Huh?

46
00:04:23,226 --> 00:04:25,261
Come on. You're bigger, faster.
It'll be fun.

47
00:04:25,261 --> 00:04:28,099
He doesn't have a cog.
Let's give him a head start.

48
00:04:28,099 --> 00:04:30,970
Why not? It's not
like he can transform.

49
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:31,938
Oh, yeah?

50
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,940
Well, watch this.

51
00:04:37,647 --> 00:04:39,110
Get him!

52
00:04:42,214 --> 00:04:43,620
I-- I-- Uh...

53
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,314
Something that flies.
Something that flies.

54
00:04:45,314 --> 00:04:46,953
<i>Prepare to be detained!</i>

55
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,724
<i>Halt, criminal!
Prepare to be detained!</i>

56
00:04:48,724 --> 00:04:50,154
<i>Halt, criminal!</i>

57
00:05:03,334 --> 00:05:04,674
Come on! Start! Come on!

58
00:05:04,674 --> 00:05:07,347
Whoa!

59
00:05:12,684 --> 00:05:14,717
Whoa. No, no, no, no!

60
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:18,490
There he is!

61
00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:25,189
Ha-ha! So long, suck--

62
00:05:26,795 --> 00:05:28,357
Ooh, Energon.

63
00:05:28,357 --> 00:05:30,161
Evening, everyone.
Pardon me.

64
00:05:37,577 --> 00:05:38,972
Hey!

65
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,550
Whoa!

66
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:48,388
- Ah, it's Orion.
- Seriously, again?

67
00:06:00,996 --> 00:06:03,062
Okay, fellas!
Thanks for the head start.

68
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:04,503
You want to give me
another one?

69
00:06:04,503 --> 00:06:06,901
- You're dead!
- I'll take that as a no.

70
00:06:06,901 --> 00:06:08,738
Hey!
Watch where you're going!

71
00:06:08,738 --> 00:06:10,575
Oh...
What did you say, no-cog?

72
00:06:10,575 --> 00:06:12,137
Sorry, sir,
I didn't mean you.

73
00:06:12,137 --> 00:06:14,007
I was referring to the
bot who was behind you.

74
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:15,514
What? Where'd he go?

75
00:06:15,514 --> 00:06:16,977
The filthy
red and blue bot?

76
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:18,946
Has a big mouth,
squeaky joints,

77
00:06:18,946 --> 00:06:20,651
gives off a corroded
metallic stench?

78
00:06:20,651 --> 00:06:22,345
- Where is he?
- He went that way.

79
00:06:22,345 --> 00:06:24,523
When I get
my hands on that bot...

80
00:06:33,457 --> 00:06:35,259
All right, all clear.

81
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:37,899
Okay, D-16,
I may be a little rusty,

82
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:39,571
but "corroded"?
That is too far.

83
00:06:39,571 --> 00:06:41,705
Let me guess. Chased
out of the archives?

84
00:06:41,705 --> 00:06:43,773
Yeah. I had to jump
out of a window this time.

85
00:06:43,773 --> 00:06:45,577
Almost died.
It was wild.

86
00:06:45,577 --> 00:06:47,810
And digging through ancient
data is worth dying for?

87
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,174
Yes, it is.

88
00:06:49,174 --> 00:06:50,648
I need a new best friend.

89
00:06:50,648 --> 00:06:52,551
If there are clues
in our recorded history

90
00:06:52,551 --> 00:06:54,652
that can help locate
the Matrix of Leadership,

91
00:06:54,652 --> 00:06:56,049
they're in the archives.

92
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:59,415
Sentinel Prime,
the Sentinel Prime,

93
00:06:59,415 --> 00:07:01,527
is up on the surface
right now,

94
00:07:01,527 --> 00:07:04,761
risking his life for us
in search of the Matrix.

95
00:07:04,761 --> 00:07:07,863
That's exactly what I'm doing.
I'm trying to help him.

96
00:07:07,863 --> 00:07:09,425
Yeah, okay.

97
00:07:09,425 --> 00:07:11,196
The sooner Energon
flows again,

98
00:07:11,196 --> 00:07:13,363
the sooner we won't
have to mine for it.

99
00:07:13,363 --> 00:07:15,706
Don't you want to choose your own path,
do whatever you want?

100
00:07:15,706 --> 00:07:18,368
We're miners.
We mine, that's all.

101
00:07:18,368 --> 00:07:22,878
No, there has got to be something
more I can do. I can feel it.

102
00:07:22,878 --> 00:07:24,913
Oh, yeah? Like the time
you had a "feeling"

103
00:07:24,913 --> 00:07:26,684
you could transform
without a cog?

104
00:07:26,684 --> 00:07:28,477
You said you were never
gonna mention that again.

105
00:07:28,477 --> 00:07:30,919
Took me three days
to pry you open.

106
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:32,052
Your feelings
get you in trouble.

107
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:33,592
Yeah, yeah.

108
00:07:33,592 --> 00:07:35,825
- Just trust in Sentinel Prime.
- I do trust in him.

109
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:39,488
Hey, if we did have cogs--

110
00:07:39,488 --> 00:07:41,765
I'd transform into a
shovel and beat you.

111
00:07:41,765 --> 00:07:43,701
I don't like how fast
you answered that.

112
00:07:43,701 --> 00:07:46,605
But listen, if you did beat me,
I couldn't give you this awesome

113
00:07:46,605 --> 00:07:48,871
Megatronus Prime thing
I have here. It's cool.

114
00:07:48,871 --> 00:07:51,841
- I'll give it to someone else.
- What Megatronus Prime thing?

115
00:07:51,841 --> 00:07:53,711
Ah, it's nothing.
Just a, you know,

116
00:07:53,711 --> 00:07:57,011
mint-condition Megatronus Prime
decal, first edition.

117
00:07:57,011 --> 00:07:58,617
What?

118
00:07:58,617 --> 00:08:00,476
If you don't want it,
I can just throw it away.

119
00:08:00,476 --> 00:08:02,082
Throw it away? Don't--
That's not funny. Let me see.

120
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:04,480
Wait. Don't grab.
You're gonna crease it.

121
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:09,122
You know, Sentinel says
Megatronus was the--

122
00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:11,025
The strongest Prime
to ever live.

123
00:08:11,025 --> 00:08:12,521
I know, buddy.

124
00:08:12,521 --> 00:08:16,701
- Looks good on you.
- Ah, it's really cool.

125
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:20,573
- Thanks.
- Always got your back.

126
00:08:21,235 --> 00:08:22,971
No matter what.

127
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:29,142
<i>Approaching
sublevel station. Stand clear of doors.</i>

128
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:31,078
<i>Mining teams,
prepare to unload.</i>

129
00:08:50,968 --> 00:08:53,562
Metal to the pedal, drill bits.
This is it.

130
00:08:53,562 --> 00:08:56,037
How much Energon have you mined
under my leadership?

131
00:08:56,037 --> 00:08:57,368
So much, Elita-1!

132
00:08:57,368 --> 00:08:59,370
And how perfect
is my mining record?

133
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:00,877
So perfect, Elita-1!

134
00:09:00,877 --> 00:09:03,242
We are a mere
30 units of Energon away

135
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:05,277
from my promotion to supervisor.

136
00:09:05,277 --> 00:09:06,850
Are you happy for me?

137
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,247
So happy, Elita-1!

138
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:11,019
Elita-- I mean Captain,

139
00:09:11,019 --> 00:09:13,725
you are looking especially shiny
this morning. New polish?

140
00:09:13,725 --> 00:09:15,727
Orion Pax,
I'm sorry that I somehow

141
00:09:15,727 --> 00:09:17,520
gave you the impression
that we're friends.

142
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,994
Apology accepted.

143
00:09:18,994 --> 00:09:20,732
Light up that wall!
Let's go! Ten seconds!

144
00:09:20,732 --> 00:09:22,360
Happy to take
the lead today, Captain.

145
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,999
Feeling like I have
enough power in me

146
00:09:23,999 --> 00:09:25,902
to drill down
and touch Primus myself.

147
00:09:25,902 --> 00:09:27,563
You don't have
the touch or the power.

148
00:09:27,563 --> 00:09:29,774
Ready positions,
rust buckets! Let's go!

149
00:09:29,774 --> 00:09:31,710
- She's in a good mood today.
- Mm-hmm.

150
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:33,437
- You ready?
- Always ready.

151
00:09:33,437 --> 00:09:35,076
Let's punch in.

152
00:09:35,076 --> 00:09:36,781
Here we go.
This one won't be open long.

153
00:09:36,781 --> 00:09:38,112
Brace it up!

154
00:09:38,719 --> 00:09:41,049
Here we go! Bridge!

155
00:09:41,049 --> 00:09:42,281
Brace up!

156
00:09:43,724 --> 00:09:45,625
Lower channel is open.

157
00:09:50,487 --> 00:09:52,390
Drill power
on max!

158
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,490
Low bridge!

159
00:09:59,069 --> 00:10:00,266
Drill it out!

160
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:03,632
I tapped a vein!

161
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,474
It's unstable!
We got to go, we got to move!

162
00:10:17,888 --> 00:10:19,516
Evacuate!

163
00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:23,124
Everyone out!
Evacuate immediately!

164
00:10:23,124 --> 00:10:24,796
The tunnel is closing.

165
00:10:24,796 --> 00:10:27,799
I repeat, the tunnel is closing!

166
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:30,967
- You with me, D?
- On your six! Keep going!

167
00:10:31,772 --> 00:10:32,936
Look out!

168
00:10:37,072 --> 00:10:38,304
Jazz is stuck!

169
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,470
Elita, we've got
a trapped miner.

170
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,340
I'm falling back to assist.

171
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,111
<i>Negative.
Do not break protocol. Evacuate!</i>

172
00:10:43,111 --> 00:10:45,245
We're gonna need more lift.

173
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:47,610
It's closing!
Just grab your pack and go.

174
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:48,853
Yeah. Good idea.

175
00:10:48,853 --> 00:10:51,185
What? No, I didn't mean it!

176
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:55,827
Pull him clear!

177
00:11:00,064 --> 00:11:01,624
<i>Pax, what's happening?</i>

178
00:11:01,624 --> 00:11:04,330
Nothing much. Just normal
protocol-following stuff.

179
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,936
It's all good.

180
00:11:05,936 --> 00:11:09,269
Oh, that's not good.

181
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:11,843
Orion Pax, could you please exit
the tunnel of death?

182
00:11:11,843 --> 00:11:13,944
<i>Elita, it's about
to get messy out there!</i>

183
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,083
Go, go, go!

184
00:11:24,647 --> 00:11:25,890
Run! Run!

185
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:27,716
Hurry!
We're not gonna make it!

186
00:11:27,716 --> 00:11:29,828
Come on! Go, go, go!

187
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:38,694
What the hell, Pax?
I told you to evacuate.

188
00:11:38,694 --> 00:11:41,268
- I did, eventually.
- If I get fired because of you--

189
00:11:41,268 --> 00:11:43,237
Oh, please.
They're not gonna fire you.

190
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,668
Elita-1, you're fired.

191
00:11:45,668 --> 00:11:48,737
What? Why? I followed
protocol to the letter.

192
00:11:48,737 --> 00:11:50,673
That is true. I was the
one who broke the rules.

193
00:11:50,673 --> 00:11:52,345
No one asked you!

194
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:54,644
Darkwing, please,
I've worked too hard for this.

195
00:11:54,644 --> 00:11:57,713
You are no-cog bots
with limited options.

196
00:11:57,713 --> 00:12:00,386
Report to waste management
immediately.

197
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,058
Waste management?

198
00:12:02,058 --> 00:12:04,060
- Elita...
- Next time, why don't you stop and think

199
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,589
before you ruin someone's life?

200
00:12:05,589 --> 00:12:06,755
I'm sorry!

201
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:10,132
- Hey, Darkwing!
- Don't do it.

202
00:12:10,132 --> 00:12:13,366
I may not have a cog,
but my finger can transform.

203
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:16,303
Guess which one? I'll
give you a "limited option."

204
00:12:18,736 --> 00:12:19,944
Excuse me, sir.

205
00:12:19,944 --> 00:12:21,847
Allow me.

206
00:12:21,847 --> 00:12:24,278
I apologize
on his behalf for the--

207
00:12:24,278 --> 00:12:26,819
Why?

208
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:42,692
That really hurt.

209
00:12:42,692 --> 00:12:44,232
What'd you expect?
He's metal.

210
00:12:44,232 --> 00:12:45,904
You know you were
out of line,

211
00:12:45,904 --> 00:12:48,137
talking back
to a superior like that.

212
00:12:48,137 --> 00:12:50,304
Darkwing was out of line.
He deserves it.

213
00:12:52,108 --> 00:12:54,605
Aren't you tired of being
treated like we're nothing?

214
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:59,049
He had every right
to hit me. I interfered.

215
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,779
Hey, and I appreciate
you having my back.

216
00:13:05,123 --> 00:13:06,892
I'm glad
you were there with me

217
00:13:06,892 --> 00:13:08,487
to get punched in the face.
That was fun.

218
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:10,720
Anytime,
buddy.

219
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,623
<i>Attention, all sectors.</i>

220
00:13:12,623 --> 00:13:15,758
<i>Stand by for a live
transmission from Sentinel Prime.</i>

221
00:13:15,758 --> 00:13:18,662
- He's back? He's back already?
- Maybe he found the Matrix.

222
00:13:22,734 --> 00:13:25,240
<i>Is it on? Okay, thank you.</i>

223
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,077
<i>Hello, my friends.</i>

224
00:13:27,077 --> 00:13:28,639
<i>Hello, Iacon City!</i>

225
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,279
<i>Hello to our saviors,
the industrious miners</i>

226
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,282
<i>who toil selflessly to maintain
our Energon reserves.</i>

227
00:13:34,282 --> 00:13:37,219
<i>I celebrate you.</i>

228
00:13:37,219 --> 00:13:40,585
Humility and presence!
That's leadership!

229
00:13:40,585 --> 00:13:42,554
Ah! Nobody does it better!

230
00:13:42,554 --> 00:13:45,326
<i>Once again, I have narrowly
returned with my fleet</i>

231
00:13:45,326 --> 00:13:46,998
<i>after another
treacherous expedition</i>

232
00:13:46,998 --> 00:13:50,364
<i>across the desolate, dangerous
surface of our planet.</i>

233
00:13:50,364 --> 00:13:52,905
<i>I departed with hopes of
finding the Matrix of Leadership,</i>

234
00:13:52,905 --> 00:13:55,105
<i>the key to bringing balance
to Cybertron.</i>

235
00:13:55,105 --> 00:13:57,140
<i>I regret to inform you</i>

236
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,537
<i>that we've
returned empty-handed.</i>

237
00:13:59,802 --> 00:14:03,179
<i>This is a setback,
but not a failure.</i>

238
00:14:03,179 --> 00:14:06,215
<i>Rest assured, I will find
the Matrix of Leadership,</i>

239
00:14:06,215 --> 00:14:08,679
<i>so that Energon can flow again.</i>

240
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:10,483
<i>But that's in the future.</i>

241
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:13,783
<i>Right now,
I think we all deserve a little fun!</i>

242
00:14:13,783 --> 00:14:16,324
<i>Tomorrow,
there will be no work. All shifts off</i>

243
00:14:16,324 --> 00:14:20,031
<i>because tomorrow
is the Iacon 5000!</i>

244
00:14:20,031 --> 00:14:23,364
Whoo! Whoo-hoo!

245
00:14:23,364 --> 00:14:24,860
<i>My favorite event.</i>

246
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:27,896
<i>A high-octane race
all across Iacon City.</i>

247
00:14:27,896 --> 00:14:32,175
<i>Let's all see which competitor can prove
they are truly more than meets the eye.</i>

248
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:41,811
D.

249
00:14:42,385 --> 00:14:44,583
Psst! Hey, D.

250
00:14:53,163 --> 00:14:55,462
Oh, good, you're up.
Come on, I have an idea.

251
00:14:55,462 --> 00:14:58,399
Whatever this is,
it better be good.

252
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,104
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay. Listen.

253
00:15:00,104 --> 00:15:02,205
All right, what if...
What if...

254
00:15:02,205 --> 00:15:04,702
What if tomorrow

255
00:15:04,702 --> 00:15:08,541
we ran
in the Iacon 5000, huh?

256
00:15:09,577 --> 00:15:11,511
What if kill you
for waking me up?

257
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:13,249
No, no, no, hear me out.

258
00:15:13,249 --> 00:15:14,712
We don't even have to win!

259
00:15:14,712 --> 00:15:16,087
Oh, that's good,
because we wouldn't.

260
00:15:16,087 --> 00:15:19,288
But-- But if we beat
just one Transformer,

261
00:15:19,288 --> 00:15:21,290
it proves
we're just as good as they are.

262
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:23,424
Not only would we
go down in history,

263
00:15:23,424 --> 00:15:26,757
the mining bots
that did the impossible,

264
00:15:26,757 --> 00:15:28,627
but we would show everyone
that we're--

265
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:30,695
we're capable
of so much more!

266
00:15:30,695 --> 00:15:32,037
Or we get
publicly humiliated

267
00:15:32,037 --> 00:15:33,764
and then busted
back to tier one.

268
00:15:33,764 --> 00:15:36,701
Yeah, but at least we would've
done something, you know?

269
00:15:36,701 --> 00:15:38,340
- Pax...
- Come on, D.

270
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,803
Pax.

271
00:15:39,803 --> 00:15:42,674
We're mining bots
who can't transform.

272
00:15:42,674 --> 00:15:45,908
We can't fly,
we can't roll,

273
00:15:45,908 --> 00:15:47,250
we can't race.

274
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,317
Come on, let's go.

275
00:15:49,813 --> 00:15:51,320
All right, fine.

276
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,058
Yeah, maybe you're right.

277
00:15:57,823 --> 00:15:59,130
Maybe.

278
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,695
The Iacon 5000
is finally here!

279
00:16:03,695 --> 00:16:05,268
I have a surprise for you.
Come on.

280
00:16:05,268 --> 00:16:07,468
Where are you going?
The stadium's that way.

281
00:16:07,468 --> 00:16:09,140
Yeah, yeah, I know.
Follow me.

282
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,241
Great.
We're gonna be late now.

283
00:16:11,241 --> 00:16:13,375
I wanted good seats.

284
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:16,246
We came all this way to miss the
opening ceremony. This is wonderful!

285
00:16:16,246 --> 00:16:18,017
Trust me,
I know what I'm doing.

286
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:20,085
Hold up!

287
00:16:23,352 --> 00:16:26,784
Get caught in one of those,
it'll launch you halfway across the city.

288
00:16:26,784 --> 00:16:28,390
Okay,
where are you taking me?

289
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,790
Don't be a glitch, this will be
totally worth it. Trust me.

290
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,132
Hey, you don't be a glitch.

291
00:16:34,132 --> 00:16:35,826
Look, I know this is, like,
fun for you,

292
00:16:35,826 --> 00:16:37,399
like, we're joking around,

293
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:39,995
but if you make me miss
any part of the Iacon 5000,

294
00:16:39,995 --> 00:16:43,570
I swear I will smelt
your face right off your...

295
00:16:46,278 --> 00:16:50,346
<i>Welcome to the Iacon 5000.
There they are.</i>

296
00:16:50,346 --> 00:16:55,648
<i>Put your hands together as today's
competitors are taking the field.</i>

297
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:58,618
Look! There's Thunderglide
and Behemoth!

298
00:16:58,618 --> 00:17:02,292
This is unbelievable!
I feel like I'm in the race!

299
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,055
You did this for me?

300
00:17:07,055 --> 00:17:08,166
No.

301
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,168
I did this for us.

302
00:17:14,636 --> 00:17:17,703
<i>And now the moment
you've all been waiting for.</i>

303
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,441
<i>The icon of Iacon!</i>

304
00:17:20,378 --> 00:17:22,576
<i>The savior of Cybertron!</i>

305
00:17:22,576 --> 00:17:26,184
<i>Quintessons fear him,
but we love him!</i>

306
00:17:26,184 --> 00:17:29,352
<i>Our leader,
the one and only...</i>

307
00:17:29,352 --> 00:17:31,156
<i>Sentinel Prime!</i>

308
00:17:31,156 --> 00:17:32,454
I love you, Sentinel!

309
00:17:35,052 --> 00:17:39,164
Yes! It feels so good
to be here with you all today.

310
00:17:42,598 --> 00:17:45,698
My friends.
My Cybertronian family.

311
00:17:46,864 --> 00:17:49,064
It has been
precisely 50 cycles

312
00:17:49,064 --> 00:17:51,605
since the Quintessons
attacked our home.

313
00:17:51,605 --> 00:17:55,147
Fifty cycles since we lost
the Matrix of Leadership

314
00:17:55,147 --> 00:17:57,776
and our Energon supply
dried up.

315
00:17:57,776 --> 00:18:01,846
Fifty cycles since the battle
that killed the other Primes,

316
00:18:01,846 --> 00:18:03,815
my brothers
and sisters in arms.

317
00:18:03,815 --> 00:18:08,050
Today we honor the Primes
who gave their lives for ours

318
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:11,757
and we show them that the strength
of Cybertron will never be diminished.

319
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:18,599
Racers, on your marks!

320
00:18:23,408 --> 00:18:26,244
I can't believe we get to watch
from the starting line.

321
00:18:26,244 --> 00:18:28,774
The best seats in the house!

322
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:29,874
Why'd you bring jetpacks?

323
00:18:29,874 --> 00:18:31,612
<i>Get set!</i>

324
00:18:31,612 --> 00:18:34,417
It's time to show them
we are more than meets the eye.

325
00:18:34,417 --> 00:18:35,814
Oh, no.

326
00:18:37,552 --> 00:18:38,883
<i>And they're off!</i>

327
00:18:45,329 --> 00:18:47,925
- Are you crazy?
- Sure feels like it.

328
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:52,930
<i>The Iacon 5000 has begun!</i>

329
00:18:55,242 --> 00:18:57,803
I'm sorry, are those
miners in the race?

330
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,245
Miners! Those are miners,
like us!

331
00:19:00,245 --> 00:19:03,138
<i>I can't believe what
I'm seeing here! Miners trying to run</i>

332
00:19:03,138 --> 00:19:04,843
<i>- in the Iacon 5000!</i>
- You've got to be kidding me.

333
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:06,944
<i>This is insane!</i>

334
00:19:06,944 --> 00:19:09,584
- There are miners in the race!
- Miners?

335
00:19:09,584 --> 00:19:10,816
- No way!
- They can't even transform!

336
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,653
It's Orion Pax and D-16!

337
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:19,055
<i>This is a first
in Iacon 5000 history.</i>

338
00:19:19,055 --> 00:19:21,156
<i>How are they going to survive?</i>

339
00:19:23,532 --> 00:19:26,029
If we survive this,
I'm gonna kill you!

340
00:19:26,029 --> 00:19:27,503
I accept those terms.

341
00:19:32,906 --> 00:19:35,874
<i>It's Tailwind pulling
into the lead down the main stretch</i>

342
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:38,646
<i>followed by Strafe and Skyfire!</i>

343
00:19:40,142 --> 00:19:41,649
Hey, look out!

344
00:19:44,214 --> 00:19:46,753
- I owe you one.
- More like a thousand.

345
00:19:49,219 --> 00:19:50,955
I can't believe
we're not in last place!

346
00:19:53,828 --> 00:19:56,026
Eat it, miner!

347
00:19:56,026 --> 00:19:59,029
<i>- Darkwing delivers a devastating blow!</i>
- Gotcha!

348
00:20:05,939 --> 00:20:08,203
- We're not fast enough!
- Improvise!

349
00:20:13,617 --> 00:20:16,321
- Hey! Get off!
- Spinout! Big fan!

350
00:20:16,321 --> 00:20:18,587
- Hey!
- Jetstorm, I'm so sorry. Big fan!

351
00:20:19,557 --> 00:20:21,216
Get off!

352
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:34,262
Time it just right!

353
00:20:34,262 --> 00:20:36,132
And... now!

354
00:20:37,608 --> 00:20:38,937
Move!

355
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:45,207
<i>And the miners
have fallen way behind.</i>

356
00:20:45,207 --> 00:20:48,078
<i>We can now focus on the
real contenders in this race.</i>

357
00:21:05,735 --> 00:21:09,374
<i>I don't believe it!
The miners take down Darkwing!</i>

358
00:21:10,608 --> 00:21:12,069
Oh, miners!

359
00:21:12,069 --> 00:21:13,807
Great effort,
Darkwing!

360
00:21:13,807 --> 00:21:15,644
That worked!
It actually worked!

361
00:21:15,644 --> 00:21:17,811
Is this the dumbest thing
we've ever done?

362
00:21:17,811 --> 00:21:19,351
Oh, yeah, it's up there!

363
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:27,282
No, no, no!

364
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:29,823
Whoa!

365
00:21:33,398 --> 00:21:34,663
Wait!

366
00:21:34,663 --> 00:21:35,895
Go, go, go!

367
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:40,163
<i>A four-bot pileup
in the magnetic tunnel</i>

368
00:21:40,163 --> 00:21:43,474
<i>and the two miners are now
in first position!</i>

369
00:21:43,474 --> 00:21:46,444
<i>This is unbelievable!</i>

370
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,845
Ah!

371
00:21:51,845 --> 00:21:53,209
D!

372
00:21:53,209 --> 00:21:55,211
No. Go. Leave me!

373
00:21:55,211 --> 00:21:57,521
No, we do this together.

374
00:21:57,521 --> 00:21:59,622
<i>One miner is now
carrying the other</i>

375
00:21:59,622 --> 00:22:01,987
<i>mere steps
from the finish line</i>

376
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:05,760
<i>in the most amazing, sensational,
dramatic, heartrending, exciting,</i>

377
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,729
<i>thrilling finish
in the history of--</i>

378
00:22:11,636 --> 00:22:13,504
<i>We have a winner!</i>

379
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:16,639
<i>Chromia comes from behind
to take the prize.</i>

380
00:22:16,639 --> 00:22:19,004
<i>Talk about an Iacon 5000
for the ages.</i>

381
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,777
Well, second place
is still pretty good.

382
00:22:26,783 --> 00:22:29,784
<i>Paging Dr. Ratchet.
Dr. Ratchet to Medical Bay 94.</i>

383
00:22:29,784 --> 00:22:31,885
Do not worry. You will
be fixed up in no time.

384
00:22:31,885 --> 00:22:34,184
Did I win?

385
00:22:34,184 --> 00:22:35,823
You participated.

386
00:22:35,823 --> 00:22:37,121
Yay!

387
00:22:38,927 --> 00:22:40,729
So...

388
00:22:40,729 --> 00:22:42,896
how long do you think
we'll be here?

389
00:22:42,896 --> 00:22:44,161
I'm not talking to you.

390
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:51,366
You know what? I can't
believe you made me do that.

391
00:22:51,366 --> 00:22:53,841
- We are so screwed!
- Thought you weren't talking to me.

392
00:22:53,841 --> 00:22:56,976
Hey, look, I know it's all a
big joke to you. But not me.

393
00:22:56,976 --> 00:22:59,209
I was paying my dues.
I was going places.

394
00:22:59,209 --> 00:23:00,584
And now they're gonna
bust me down

395
00:23:00,584 --> 00:23:02,047
I-- I don't even know
how many tiers!

396
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,851
I'm sorry, D.

397
00:23:03,851 --> 00:23:05,589
But come on,
didn't you feel it?

398
00:23:05,589 --> 00:23:07,690
Even for just a second,
didn't you feel liberated?

399
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:09,318
Didn't you feel like
you were something else?

400
00:23:09,318 --> 00:23:12,189
Like you could be more
than what they say you are?

401
00:23:12,189 --> 00:23:14,895
Yeah, I felt it. I did.

402
00:23:16,129 --> 00:23:17,568
But it doesn't matter.

403
00:23:17,568 --> 00:23:19,933
We're going to get
punished and demoted.

404
00:23:19,933 --> 00:23:23,035
Sentinel Prime
saw the whole thing.

405
00:23:23,035 --> 00:23:25,301
This is so embarrassing.

406
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:39,986
It's clear.

407
00:23:44,058 --> 00:23:45,420
Orion Pax.

408
00:23:46,192 --> 00:23:47,895
D-16.

409
00:23:47,895 --> 00:23:49,534
What you two did today

410
00:23:49,534 --> 00:23:52,130
was one of the craziest
things I've ever seen.

411
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:54,638
Sir, this is all my idea,
and we're so sorry.

412
00:23:54,638 --> 00:23:56,068
I loved it!

413
00:23:56,068 --> 00:23:57,135
You did?

414
00:23:57,135 --> 00:23:59,005
How could anyone
not love it?

415
00:23:59,005 --> 00:24:01,777
You gave my best racers
a real run for their money.

416
00:24:01,777 --> 00:24:04,175
So we're not
getting demoted?

417
00:24:04,175 --> 00:24:05,374
Demoted?

418
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,479
Demoted.

419
00:24:12,755 --> 00:24:14,482
What is happening?

420
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:19,289
The fact of the matter is
we're halfway into the first shift

421
00:24:19,289 --> 00:24:24,668
since the race ended and that mining
crew has already reached 150% quota.

422
00:24:24,668 --> 00:24:26,802
You inspired them
to work harder!

423
00:24:26,802 --> 00:24:28,903
Sentinel Prime, sir,

424
00:24:28,903 --> 00:24:33,171
we joined the race
to show everyone our potential.

425
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:35,107
That we bots can do
more than just mine--

426
00:24:35,107 --> 00:24:38,440
Outstanding! I love a bot
that can think for himself.

427
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,178
Perhaps you two
could tour the mines,

428
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:42,477
speak to your brethren, and
help them see their potential.

429
00:24:42,477 --> 00:24:44,622
Wow! Okay, great.

430
00:24:44,622 --> 00:24:46,415
That sounds incredible.

431
00:24:46,415 --> 00:24:48,318
- I would love to--
- Sir, it's time.

432
00:24:48,318 --> 00:24:49,957
Ah, yes.

433
00:24:49,957 --> 00:24:51,629
I'm sorry, friends.

434
00:24:51,629 --> 00:24:53,697
We're preparing our
next travel to the surface.

435
00:24:53,697 --> 00:24:56,491
But in the meantime,
I've got a treat for you.

436
00:24:56,491 --> 00:24:59,637
Hang tight. Airachnid,
have someone escort these heroes

437
00:24:59,637 --> 00:25:01,496
to my personal
service facilities.

438
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:04,499
Best care in Iacon.

439
00:25:04,499 --> 00:25:06,336
Until next time, legends.

440
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:14,113
Sentinel Prime.
The Sentinel Prime!

441
00:25:14,113 --> 00:25:16,214
- You still mad at me?
- I am less mad at you.

442
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:18,854
I'm telling you, D. I got a feeling
that everything's gonna change

443
00:25:18,854 --> 00:25:20,020
and we're gonna go--

444
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:22,858
Miners!

445
00:25:23,388 --> 00:25:25,927
Hi, Darkwing.

446
00:25:26,996 --> 00:25:29,491
- Oh, no, no, no.
- No!

447
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:33,066
Wait, wait!
You don't understand!

448
00:25:33,066 --> 00:25:35,563
We were supposed to go
to Sentinel Prime's service pod!

449
00:25:35,563 --> 00:25:38,874
You two dolts aren't going
to see anyone ever again.

450
00:25:38,874 --> 00:25:40,370
I'll make sure of that.

451
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:42,680
You're making a mistake!
Ask Sentinel!

452
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,814
I hate that guy!

453
00:25:58,588 --> 00:26:00,357
You! How did you get down here?

454
00:26:00,357 --> 00:26:02,095
There's no access to this level.

455
00:26:02,095 --> 00:26:04,130
There is nobody
down here but me.

456
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:06,671
Oh, my gosh, you're real!

457
00:26:06,671 --> 00:26:09,905
You're others!
You're not... me!

458
00:26:09,905 --> 00:26:12,644
You're here,
and you're not me!

459
00:26:14,877 --> 00:26:16,879
- Uh, yeah.
- Awesome!

460
00:26:16,879 --> 00:26:19,376
I am so sorry. That must
have been weird for you.

461
00:26:19,376 --> 00:26:21,576
I just haven't had
a lot of company

462
00:26:21,576 --> 00:26:23,688
since they put me
down here in sublevel 50.

463
00:26:23,688 --> 00:26:26,955
Fifty? But there
are only 40 sublevels.

464
00:26:26,955 --> 00:26:28,616
That's what I thought!

465
00:26:28,616 --> 00:26:31,586
Turns out there are ten more,
and they are not pleasant.

466
00:26:31,586 --> 00:26:33,357
Probably why nobody ever
really talks about them.

467
00:26:33,357 --> 00:26:34,765
How long have you
been down here?

468
00:26:34,765 --> 00:26:36,426
How long have I been here?

469
00:26:36,426 --> 00:26:39,627
Let's see, somewhere
between a long time and forever?

470
00:26:39,627 --> 00:26:43,367
I mean, I had other jobs,
but I kept getting reassigned

471
00:26:43,367 --> 00:26:45,237
'cause I'm so good
at what I do.

472
00:26:45,237 --> 00:26:48,273
Oh! I'm B-127, by the way.

473
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:49,747
But you can call me B.

474
00:26:49,747 --> 00:26:51,408
And I'm actually
working on some nicknames.

475
00:26:51,408 --> 00:26:54,114
The one I'm floating right now
is Badassatron.

476
00:26:54,114 --> 00:26:57,887
Which is actually pronounced...
"Badassatron."

477
00:26:57,887 --> 00:26:59,251
But if you have any critiques--

478
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:02,254
Yeah, great.
How do we get out of here?

479
00:27:02,254 --> 00:27:04,190
Great question. You don't.

480
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:05,796
- We don't?
- Nope.

481
00:27:05,796 --> 00:27:08,095
We have limited access
to the waste management area,

482
00:27:08,095 --> 00:27:12,165
but the new shift manager there
does not like distractions.

483
00:27:12,165 --> 00:27:15,201
No, they prefer we stay here
on the task at hand.

484
00:27:15,201 --> 00:27:16,774
- Which is?
- Oh!

485
00:27:16,774 --> 00:27:19,711
The scrap comes in
from the chute there

486
00:27:19,711 --> 00:27:21,504
onto the conveyor belt.

487
00:27:21,504 --> 00:27:24,441
Our job is to look for anything
that might be worth salvaging

488
00:27:24,441 --> 00:27:27,147
before it hits the furnace
and gets smelted.

489
00:27:27,147 --> 00:27:29,182
So you watch garbage burn.

490
00:27:29,182 --> 00:27:30,678
Yes!

491
00:27:30,678 --> 00:27:32,317
It is so great
that you're here now.

492
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,220
I can't wait to learn
everything about you.

493
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,057
And then tell you
everything about me!

494
00:27:36,057 --> 00:27:38,961
I have a lot of hopes and dreams
that I am just dying to share

495
00:27:38,961 --> 00:27:40,292
with one or two
new best friends.

496
00:27:40,292 --> 00:27:42,492
Uh, yeah, I would love to--

497
00:27:42,492 --> 00:27:44,164
Where are my manners?

498
00:27:44,164 --> 00:27:45,968
Come on, I'll introduce you
to the rest of the crew.

499
00:27:45,968 --> 00:27:47,970
Hey, guys, we've got company!

500
00:27:49,204 --> 00:27:51,776
This is EP-508,

501
00:27:51,776 --> 00:27:55,538
this is A-A-Tron,
and this fella here is Steve.

502
00:27:55,538 --> 00:27:57,947
- "Steve"?
- Yeah, he's foreign.

503
00:27:57,947 --> 00:27:59,916
Question:
Do they talk back to you?

504
00:27:59,916 --> 00:28:02,215
Um, they're not real.

505
00:28:02,215 --> 00:28:04,855
Jeez, you think I'm that crazy?

506
00:28:04,855 --> 00:28:06,318
It's just
you've been down here a--

507
00:28:06,318 --> 00:28:07,891
No, I was talking to Steve.

508
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,520
Classic Steve.

509
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,324
- What is that?
- Look at this guy.

510
00:28:12,324 --> 00:28:15,360
It's coming from inside.

511
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,868
Oh! Steve! No!

512
00:28:17,868 --> 00:28:21,069
- I am so sorry.
- Steve, no!

513
00:28:21,069 --> 00:28:23,170
- We can fix it, don't worry.
- My Steve!

514
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:28,076
<i>Quintesson ambush!</i>

515
00:28:28,076 --> 00:28:31,211
<i>Calling the High Guard for
immediate support. Immediate support!</i>

516
00:28:31,884 --> 00:28:33,477
That's Alpha Trion.

517
00:28:33,477 --> 00:28:35,017
One of the Primes?

518
00:28:35,017 --> 00:28:37,349
<i>Repeat,
Zeta Prime has fallen!</i>

519
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:40,187
- It's an SOS message.
<i>- Protect the Matrix!</i>

520
00:28:40,187 --> 00:28:43,454
<i>Sending location coordinates.
Sending location coordinates.</i>

521
00:28:46,965 --> 00:28:49,361
Holy Primus!

522
00:28:49,361 --> 00:28:52,661
Those are coordinates
to a location on the surface.

523
00:28:52,661 --> 00:28:57,270
This could be where the Primes
died in the Quintesson war.

524
00:28:57,270 --> 00:29:00,702
Which means
this is where we could find

525
00:29:00,702 --> 00:29:03,045
the Matrix of Leadership.

526
00:29:03,045 --> 00:29:06,576
What are you talking about? It's an old
beacon inside a statue made of garbage.

527
00:29:06,576 --> 00:29:08,215
Or it's a clue
of how we could find

528
00:29:08,215 --> 00:29:10,987
- the Matrix of Leadership.
- No. No way. Absolutely not!

529
00:29:10,987 --> 00:29:13,781
Hey, D, come on, this could be our
chance to show everyone we're not--

530
00:29:13,781 --> 00:29:15,222
You already tried
to "show everyone"

531
00:29:15,222 --> 00:29:16,751
in the race you
tricked me into running,

532
00:29:16,751 --> 00:29:18,126
which got us
stuck down here

533
00:29:18,126 --> 00:29:20,557
in this waste hole
with this, uh...

534
00:29:21,791 --> 00:29:23,494
really cool guy.

535
00:29:23,494 --> 00:29:25,727
- Oh, thank you.
- I'm just saying--

536
00:29:25,727 --> 00:29:27,531
There's a reason no
one goes to the surface.

537
00:29:27,531 --> 00:29:29,269
It's dangerous!

538
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:31,634
I'm waiting right here until
Sentinel Prime finds us.

539
00:29:31,634 --> 00:29:33,504
Oh, okay. Yeah. Hmm.

540
00:29:33,504 --> 00:29:36,573
Well, we'll just stay here forever.
That cool with you, B?

541
00:29:36,573 --> 00:29:37,981
Forever? This is great!

542
00:29:37,981 --> 00:29:40,214
I have new coworkers
and roommates.

543
00:29:40,214 --> 00:29:42,150
There's plenty of room
now that Steve is dead.

544
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:44,284
I usually sleep on the conveyor belt,
but you can totally have it.

545
00:29:44,284 --> 00:29:45,813
I'll sleep in the corner
next to A-A-Tron.

546
00:29:45,813 --> 00:29:47,551
Plenty of room
for you to stretch out, too,

547
00:29:47,551 --> 00:29:49,960
'cause you're taller than I am.
Know what I mean?

548
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:54,063
Hey, D, what do you think Sentinel's reaction
would be if you personally handed him

549
00:29:54,063 --> 00:29:57,033
the Matrix of Leadership
that you found?

550
00:29:57,033 --> 00:29:59,937
Okay, stop.
I know what you're trying to do.

551
00:29:59,937 --> 00:30:02,203
And it's definitely working.
I'm in.

552
00:30:02,203 --> 00:30:04,733
- Hah, ha! Yeah, buddy.
- How do we get to the surface?

553
00:30:04,733 --> 00:30:06,911
Pfft! You kidding me?
The surface?

554
00:30:06,911 --> 00:30:09,045
Easy. I know a way.

555
00:30:10,213 --> 00:30:11,806
But it won't be easy.

556
00:30:12,776 --> 00:30:14,776
Why is there so much trash? Ah!

557
00:30:14,776 --> 00:30:17,152
Warn me next time,
please. My mouth was open.

558
00:30:17,152 --> 00:30:19,649
Only 49 sublevels to go!

559
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:22,817
Waste-disposal trains
are the only vehicles

560
00:30:22,817 --> 00:30:24,995
that go all the way
to the surface.

561
00:30:24,995 --> 00:30:27,459
Yeah, but they don't allow
passengers. The trains are autonomous.

562
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:29,857
Yeah, that's the
"won't be easy" part.

563
00:30:29,857 --> 00:30:32,332
It's perfect. We'll be
safe inside the train.

564
00:30:39,803 --> 00:30:41,440
That's the last one.
Send 'er up!

565
00:30:46,711 --> 00:30:49,184
Hold up! One more.

566
00:30:53,256 --> 00:30:54,552
I'll lock it down.

567
00:31:02,628 --> 00:31:05,860
Thanks for being an idiot,
whoever you are.

568
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:09,006
Turning you in will definitely get
me promoted back up a rank or two.

569
00:31:09,006 --> 00:31:11,041
Got her!

570
00:31:11,041 --> 00:31:12,240
No, wait, I--

571
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,571
Elita! Stop!

572
00:31:13,571 --> 00:31:15,375
- Orion?
- Hold on, let me--

573
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:16,607
Security! Sound the ala--

574
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:24,923
- She's headed to the engine!
- Don't worry, I got this.

575
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:29,257
Hold on, let me explain!
We're on a mission!

576
00:31:29,257 --> 00:31:31,424
So am I. To ruin your life.

577
00:31:41,964 --> 00:31:45,042
Elita, wait. We found a message.
We know where--

578
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:47,902
This bot is crazy! Who is she?

579
00:31:47,902 --> 00:31:50,443
Dead end, Elita.
There's no way...

580
00:31:50,443 --> 00:31:51,642
Well, she's gone.

581
00:32:06,494 --> 00:32:07,922
Whoa!

582
00:32:07,922 --> 00:32:10,859
Why? Why am I doing this?
Why am I doing this?

583
00:32:10,859 --> 00:32:12,003
Climb faster!

584
00:32:26,976 --> 00:32:28,316
Gotcha!

585
00:33:01,582 --> 00:33:03,681
Ah, the surface.

586
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:06,222
It's beautiful.

587
00:33:08,094 --> 00:33:12,162
I am speechless.

588
00:33:13,462 --> 00:33:15,660
Elita, listen to me.

589
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,926
We know where
the Matrix of Leadership is.

590
00:33:17,926 --> 00:33:19,961
Oh, sure.
And I'm really a Prime.

591
00:33:19,961 --> 00:33:23,371
I just prefer loading
crates of toxic waste.

592
00:33:23,371 --> 00:33:25,868
Whoa.
Where did you get this?

593
00:33:25,868 --> 00:33:27,639
From my friend Steve.
Orion killed him.

594
00:33:27,639 --> 00:33:30,114
- I did not kill Steve.
- He was never alive.

595
00:33:30,114 --> 00:33:31,511
- What?
- Look.

596
00:33:31,511 --> 00:33:33,711
Sentinel told us
he was going to the surface,

597
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:35,614
and then we found this message.

598
00:33:35,614 --> 00:33:37,847
We figured that we could
hand deliver it to him

599
00:33:37,847 --> 00:33:40,850
or scout
the locations ourselves.

600
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:42,159
Whichever comes first.

601
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,723
This was too important to wait.

602
00:33:46,528 --> 00:33:48,429
It will change all of our lives.

603
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,234
No, no, no, no.

604
00:33:51,234 --> 00:33:54,534
I'm not going to get demoted
again because of you.

605
00:33:54,534 --> 00:33:56,404
I'm turning this rig around
and I'm notifying the--

606
00:33:56,404 --> 00:33:58,340
Hey, guys? Guys?

607
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,407
What is that?

608
00:34:03,347 --> 00:34:05,039
Is it getting bigger?

609
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:07,877
Or closer?

610
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,953
No, no, no, no, no, no!

611
00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:22,562
Are you closing?
Don't close. Stop closing.

612
00:34:22,562 --> 00:34:23,563
It's closed!

613
00:34:23,563 --> 00:34:24,762
Oh, come on!

614
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:33,804
Oh, now I know why
no one comes to the surface!

615
00:34:57,401 --> 00:34:58,565
<i>Elita?</i>

616
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:01,898
Elita?

617
00:35:01,898 --> 00:35:03,372
You okay?

618
00:35:05,838 --> 00:35:07,640
Please stop
punching me in the face.

619
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,839
Can you help?

620
00:35:08,839 --> 00:35:10,676
Iacon-- The train--

621
00:35:10,676 --> 00:35:13,910
- Where's the train?
- Relax, okay? Here it comes.

622
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:15,945
And there it goes.

623
00:35:15,945 --> 00:35:19,080
Okay, I was wrong about that.
It was going the other way.

624
00:35:26,727 --> 00:35:31,268
Okay,
so I think this is us,

625
00:35:31,268 --> 00:35:33,798
- and if we follow the path to--
- Now you listen to me,

626
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:36,372
Mr. "Zero Seconds
Since My Last Accident"!

627
00:35:36,372 --> 00:35:39,474
I'll go on your little quest
because I don't have a choice.

628
00:35:39,474 --> 00:35:43,346
But I carry the map, I navigate,
and if this leads to nothing,

629
00:35:43,346 --> 00:35:45,942
then I'm dragging you
and those two idiot go-bots

630
00:35:45,942 --> 00:35:47,350
back to Iacon City

631
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:50,012
and to the first
supervisor depot we see,

632
00:35:50,012 --> 00:35:52,982
at which point you will explain
everything that's happened,

633
00:35:52,982 --> 00:35:54,786
using words that reflect me

634
00:35:54,786 --> 00:35:57,052
in a very positive light!
Got it?

635
00:35:57,052 --> 00:35:59,329
Yeah, okay.
Deal. Great. All right.

636
00:35:59,329 --> 00:36:01,661
- Let's go!
- She's joining us?

637
00:36:01,661 --> 00:36:03,300
Fantastic!

638
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:06,699
Hi there. Uh, Elita, right?
Am I saying that right?

639
00:36:06,699 --> 00:36:08,965
Wanted to formally
introduce myself.

640
00:36:08,965 --> 00:36:12,639
I'm B-127. You kneed me
in the face earlier, back there.

641
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:15,312
You can call me B,
or Badassatron.

642
00:36:15,312 --> 00:36:17,072
It's a nickname
some of the guys gave me.

643
00:36:17,072 --> 00:36:19,481
I don't know. I didn't give it
to myself or anything.

644
00:36:19,481 --> 00:36:22,583
Actually, it's pronounced...
"Badassatron,"

645
00:36:24,246 --> 00:36:25,685
in case you were wondering.

646
00:36:26,688 --> 00:36:28,985
Badassatron.

647
00:36:28,985 --> 00:36:30,987
You like that, right?

648
00:36:30,987 --> 00:36:33,187
- Badass--
- I'm gonna need you to talk less.

649
00:36:33,187 --> 00:36:34,958
Sure! No-- Yeah, no problem.

650
00:36:34,958 --> 00:36:36,663
What am I talking less about,
my nickname?

651
00:36:36,663 --> 00:36:38,962
That's fine with me.
Got some mountains over here...

652
00:36:38,962 --> 00:36:40,865
Hey. You're thinking
about what you'll say

653
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,834
when you hand the Matrix
to Sentinel, aren't you?

654
00:36:42,834 --> 00:36:44,132
I can't help it.

655
00:36:44,132 --> 00:36:46,409
D, we're really doing this.

656
00:36:46,409 --> 00:36:49,874
So glad I'm out here with you.
This was a great idea.

657
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,513
I'm just having a good time.

658
00:36:51,513 --> 00:36:53,075
How much further
is the Matrix on the map?

659
00:36:53,075 --> 00:36:54,582
Make an educated guesstimate.

660
00:36:54,582 --> 00:36:56,551
This is the coolest thing
that has ever happened

661
00:36:56,551 --> 00:36:58,520
to anyone anywhere,
I'm telling you!

662
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,918
<i>♪ Not one, not two,
not three, but four ♪</i>

663
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:04,185
<i>♪ Four best friends who are
walking through the door ♪</i>

664
00:37:04,185 --> 00:37:05,593
There's no doors,
we're outside.

665
00:37:05,593 --> 00:37:07,089
Hey, look,
there's more of it over here.

666
00:37:07,089 --> 00:37:09,696
- What is it?
- It's not metal.

667
00:37:09,696 --> 00:37:13,161
It's like some kind
of weird nature. It's weird.

668
00:37:13,161 --> 00:37:14,569
So are they.

669
00:37:14,569 --> 00:37:16,164
<i>♪ Going to the Matrix ♪</i>

670
00:37:16,164 --> 00:37:17,704
<i>♪ With my best friends ♪</i>

671
00:37:17,704 --> 00:37:19,739
What was that?

672
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:32,081
Um...

673
00:37:32,081 --> 00:37:34,622
I think this is not right.
We should go.

674
00:37:34,622 --> 00:37:36,459
- Yeah, good idea.
- Run!

675
00:37:36,459 --> 00:37:38,527
What are we running from?

676
00:38:03,244 --> 00:38:05,587
- What is that?
- Oh, no.

677
00:38:05,587 --> 00:38:07,754
- It's a Quintesson ship.
- What?

678
00:38:07,754 --> 00:38:10,460
- What do we do? What do we do?
- Shh! Quiet.

679
00:38:21,033 --> 00:38:23,341
It's scanning for life-forms.
Move, move!

680
00:38:29,006 --> 00:38:30,304
Wait!

681
00:38:33,683 --> 00:38:35,144
Go, go, go, go!

682
00:38:43,187 --> 00:38:44,285
Come on!

683
00:38:44,285 --> 00:38:46,023
They're not gonna make it.

684
00:38:55,001 --> 00:38:56,297
Whoa.

685
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:15,184
What-- What were they
searching for?

686
00:39:15,184 --> 00:39:17,021
Someone to hug, B.
How should I know?

687
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,089
I'm not waiting around
to find out.

688
00:39:19,795 --> 00:39:21,465
This way.
We're close.

689
00:39:21,465 --> 00:39:24,259
Quintessons haven't
been here for 50 cycles.

690
00:39:24,259 --> 00:39:26,932
It doesn't make sense.
There's nothing out here.

691
00:39:49,451 --> 00:39:52,529
A cave with teeth.
Nothing scary about that.

692
00:39:59,703 --> 00:40:02,198
Knives coming
out of the ceiling. Amazing.

693
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,706
Everyone,
do we have to go insi--?

694
00:40:04,706 --> 00:40:06,774
Okay, yep, we're going in.

695
00:40:06,774 --> 00:40:09,073
Why shouldn't we? Just walking
into the scariest place

696
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,580
I've ever seen
in my entire life.

697
00:40:12,375 --> 00:40:13,649
This is ridiculous.

698
00:40:37,301 --> 00:40:39,004
I don't believe it.

699
00:40:39,776 --> 00:40:41,138
The Primes.

700
00:40:42,779 --> 00:40:43,910
We're here.

701
00:41:19,849 --> 00:41:21,882
Megatronus Prime.

702
00:41:36,294 --> 00:41:37,667
Zeta Prime.

703
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:42,001
The Matrix!

704
00:41:45,303 --> 00:41:46,577
It's gone.

705
00:41:49,043 --> 00:41:50,504
Let's keep looking.

706
00:42:17,709 --> 00:42:18,741
Hey, guys!

707
00:42:36,794 --> 00:42:38,629
It's Alpha Trion!

708
00:42:39,357 --> 00:42:40,730
He's powered down.

709
00:42:41,557 --> 00:42:44,393
But his spark is still lit.

710
00:43:02,479 --> 00:43:04,787
Quintesson ambush!

711
00:43:04,787 --> 00:43:06,382
Attack!

712
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:10,617
Message before--

713
00:43:10,617 --> 00:43:12,828
Whoa, whoa, it's okay!
It's okay.

714
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:14,665
You're safe now.

715
00:43:15,261 --> 00:43:16,392
The war is over.

716
00:43:37,954 --> 00:43:40,383
I failed you, old friend.

717
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:45,388
You deserved
so much better than this end.

718
00:43:45,388 --> 00:43:47,995
No, you didn't fail.

719
00:43:47,995 --> 00:43:50,833
We heard your message.
We've come to find the Matrix.

720
00:43:50,833 --> 00:43:54,034
Your transformation cogs.
What happened to you?

721
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:55,937
Who are you?

722
00:43:55,937 --> 00:43:58,302
We're cogless miners,
from Iacon.

723
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:01,404
Miners? Why?

724
00:44:01,404 --> 00:44:02,845
Well, we've had
to drill for Energon

725
00:44:02,845 --> 00:44:04,979
ever since
it stopped flowing.

726
00:44:04,979 --> 00:44:06,277
Impossible.

727
00:44:06,277 --> 00:44:08,510
That's why we came.
To fix things.

728
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:10,578
If we find
the Matrix of Leadership

729
00:44:10,578 --> 00:44:12,316
and get it to Sentinel Prime,
he can fix--

730
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:15,693
Sentinel is no Prime.

731
00:44:17,059 --> 00:44:19,455
- What?
- He's broken. Fantastic.

732
00:44:19,455 --> 00:44:21,292
What are you talking about?
Why would you say that?

733
00:44:21,292 --> 00:44:23,195
Sentinel Prime
is our protector.

734
00:44:23,195 --> 00:44:25,329
He's been saving us from
the Quintessons ever since--

735
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:29,300
You have not been saved.
You've been living a lie.

736
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:32,303
I saw the truth
with my own eyes.

737
00:44:32,303 --> 00:44:35,438
Come. I will show you.

738
00:44:41,413 --> 00:44:44,920
For thousands of cycles,
the war with the Quintessons

739
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:48,022
had been a brutal conflict.

740
00:44:52,259 --> 00:44:56,228
<i>Until Sentinel,
the principal aide to the Primes,</i>

741
00:44:56,228 --> 00:44:59,231
<i>intercepted an enemy transmission.</i>

742
00:44:59,231 --> 00:45:04,137
<i>There was going to be a secret
gathering of Quintesson commanders.</i>

743
00:45:04,137 --> 00:45:06,909
<i>Their elimination
could end the war.</i>

744
00:45:06,909 --> 00:45:13,080
It was a mission so important,
we Primes took it on ourselves.

745
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:17,348
We agreed to meet Sentinel for
his sensitive intel in secret,

746
00:45:17,348 --> 00:45:19,988
here in this cave.

747
00:45:19,988 --> 00:45:21,748
But we were not alone.

748
00:45:24,058 --> 00:45:25,587
- Quintessons!
- They're here!

749
00:45:25,587 --> 00:45:27,094
- It's a trap!
- Battle positions!

750
00:45:27,094 --> 00:45:29,558
- Hold the line!
- Primus be with us!

751
00:45:32,398 --> 00:45:34,662
For Cybertron!

752
00:45:41,242 --> 00:45:43,374
<i>We were outnumbered,
but stood as one.</i>

753
00:45:45,642 --> 00:45:47,609
<i>Our victory was near.</i>

754
00:45:51,219 --> 00:45:53,087
<i>Until we were betrayed.</i>

755
00:46:17,914 --> 00:46:20,576
Sentinel, why?

756
00:46:20,576 --> 00:46:23,117
For all the power
of Cybertron.

757
00:46:26,353 --> 00:46:32,687
<i>But Sentinel never understood
the true power of what he desired.</i>

758
00:46:32,687 --> 00:46:36,757
<i>The Matrix of Leadership
can only be wielded</i>

759
00:46:36,757 --> 00:46:41,729
<i>by one that Primus himself
deems worthy.</i>

760
00:46:42,831 --> 00:46:47,438
<i>And Sentinel
most certainly was not.</i>

761
00:46:47,438 --> 00:46:49,506
No!

762
00:46:52,478 --> 00:46:58,812
Wait. Hold on. You're saying that
the Matrix of Leadership just vanished?

763
00:46:58,812 --> 00:47:00,484
No.

764
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:02,893
No, no, no. That is impossible.
I don't believe it.

765
00:47:02,893 --> 00:47:04,752
Why would Sentinel
do that?

766
00:47:04,752 --> 00:47:06,358
To make a bargain.

767
00:47:06,358 --> 00:47:08,294
A bargain? With who?

768
00:47:11,033 --> 00:47:14,531
With the new rulers
of Cybertron.

769
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,505
The Quintessons.

770
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:22,737
There are so many.

771
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:46,068
He's here.

772
00:47:47,005 --> 00:47:49,302
Sentinel Prime is here.

773
00:48:22,403 --> 00:48:25,437
- Keep your eyes open.
- They always are.

774
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,018
I load those crates.

775
00:49:08,018 --> 00:49:10,449
Those are filled
with contaminated metal.

776
00:49:10,449 --> 00:49:12,154
I don't understand.

777
00:49:12,154 --> 00:49:14,783
What do the Quintessons
want with toxic waste?

778
00:49:19,328 --> 00:49:21,130
Our Energon.

779
00:49:28,073 --> 00:49:29,336
- Traitor!
- D, no.

780
00:49:41,977 --> 00:49:44,516
I know
what I promised you

781
00:49:44,516 --> 00:49:47,651
but our mines,
they're running out!

782
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:49,851
There's barely
enough Energon for us.

783
00:49:52,425 --> 00:49:54,658
I swear I will
get you the rest.

784
00:50:00,369 --> 00:50:02,204
Triple-time
every mining shift.

785
00:50:02,204 --> 00:50:04,899
No miner gets a break
until I get my Energon.

786
00:50:04,899 --> 00:50:06,571
All of it! Let's go.

787
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:26,426
Now you have seen the truth.

788
00:50:29,893 --> 00:50:31,365
Every day...

789
00:50:32,401 --> 00:50:37,965
Every single day
of my life

790
00:50:37,965 --> 00:50:40,539
has been a lie.

791
00:50:41,377 --> 00:50:43,036
My God, I knew it!

792
00:50:43,036 --> 00:50:45,907
Deep down,
I always felt something was off.

793
00:50:45,907 --> 00:50:48,415
He deceived everyone.

794
00:50:48,415 --> 00:50:53,585
Sentinel bought himself power and
then put us to work paying off his debt.

795
00:50:53,585 --> 00:50:55,356
I can't believe it.

796
00:50:55,356 --> 00:50:56,885
Well, obviously,
I can believe it,

797
00:50:56,885 --> 00:50:58,722
I just saw it,
but I still...

798
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:00,757
I can't believe it.

799
00:51:00,757 --> 00:51:03,760
Sentinel lied

800
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,894
- to my face.
- It was all a sham.

801
00:51:05,894 --> 00:51:08,732
How could we
have been so gullible?

802
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:12,373
Oh, this-- this is going
to change everything.

803
00:51:17,072 --> 00:51:19,380
You just had to do it,
didn't you?

804
00:51:19,976 --> 00:51:21,712
Me? What did I do?

805
00:51:21,712 --> 00:51:23,549
You just had
to go to the surface,

806
00:51:23,549 --> 00:51:25,584
had to enter the Iacon 5000.

807
00:51:25,584 --> 00:51:28,158
You just had to break protocol!

808
00:51:28,158 --> 00:51:30,424
- Who cares about protocol?
- I do!

809
00:51:30,987 --> 00:51:32,591
I care!

810
00:51:32,591 --> 00:51:35,231
Because nothing bad happens
when you stay on protocol!

811
00:51:35,231 --> 00:51:36,727
Sentinel Prime
has been forcing us

812
00:51:36,727 --> 00:51:39,092
to work in the mines
until our gears strip,

813
00:51:39,092 --> 00:51:42,799
and all the while he's been giving the
Energon away to our greatest enemies!

814
00:51:42,799 --> 00:51:45,802
And what do you think he's going to
do to us when he finds out that we know?

815
00:51:45,802 --> 00:51:47,903
I'm not thinking about
what he's going to do,

816
00:51:47,903 --> 00:51:49,575
I'm thinking about
what we're going to do.

817
00:51:49,575 --> 00:51:51,346
That's the whole thing!

818
00:51:51,346 --> 00:51:53,744
You're never thinking about
anything else, just yourself!

819
00:51:53,744 --> 00:51:58,078
Fantastic! Another Orion Pax
master plan. I can't wait to hear this.

820
00:51:58,078 --> 00:51:59,453
Don't you want
to stop him?

821
00:51:59,453 --> 00:52:01,356
No, I want to kill him!

822
00:52:02,623 --> 00:52:04,293
I want to put Sentinel in chains

823
00:52:04,293 --> 00:52:05,954
and march him
through the mines

824
00:52:05,954 --> 00:52:09,496
so everyone can see him
for the false Prime that he is!

825
00:52:09,496 --> 00:52:13,434
I want him to suffer
and then to die in darkness.

826
00:52:14,701 --> 00:52:16,129
But we all know
that it doesn't matter

827
00:52:16,129 --> 00:52:17,768
what I want, right, Pax?

828
00:52:17,768 --> 00:52:21,376
The fact is,
we're just cogless bots. Right?

829
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:28,218
We had limited
options, and now... now we have none.

830
00:52:29,518 --> 00:52:34,488
No son or daughter of Cybertron
is born without a cog.

831
00:52:34,488 --> 00:52:37,425
Oh, yeah. I've been with
myself since I came online,

832
00:52:37,425 --> 00:52:40,395
and this slot's
always been empty.

833
00:52:40,395 --> 00:52:42,430
What are you saying?
Are you saying--

834
00:52:42,430 --> 00:52:46,027
No. No way. Nobody could be that evil,
not even Sentinel.

835
00:52:46,027 --> 00:52:50,471
He removed your cogs
before you came online.

836
00:52:50,471 --> 00:52:55,674
We were born with transformation cogs,
but he...

837
00:52:55,674 --> 00:52:57,643
He took them from us.

838
00:52:57,643 --> 00:53:00,877
What defines a Transformer...

839
00:53:00,877 --> 00:53:03,352
...is not the cog
in his chest

840
00:53:03,352 --> 00:53:08,390
but the spark
that resides in their core.

841
00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:13,725
A spark that gives you the will
to make your world better.

842
00:53:14,629 --> 00:53:18,224
My fellow Primes had that spark.

843
00:53:18,224 --> 00:53:22,272
And I see their strength
in you.

844
00:53:23,836 --> 00:53:30,346
Take their cogs and
access your full potential.

845
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,480
Prima.

846
00:53:33,945 --> 00:53:35,010
Onyx.

847
00:53:35,617 --> 00:53:37,144
Alchemist.

848
00:53:37,916 --> 00:53:39,355
Micronus.

849
00:53:39,355 --> 00:53:45,185
Warriors of noble spirit,
loyalty, strength.

850
00:53:45,185 --> 00:53:49,189
Their uniqueness
enhanced by these.

851
00:54:16,053 --> 00:54:20,462
They were one. You are one.

852
00:54:20,462 --> 00:54:23,333
All are one!

853
00:54:36,513 --> 00:54:39,976
Wait. We have...
You-- You gave us...

854
00:54:39,976 --> 00:54:43,485
The ability
to change your world.

855
00:54:43,485 --> 00:54:48,655
How you choose to use
that power is up to you.

856
00:54:53,594 --> 00:54:54,925
They've found us.

857
00:54:54,925 --> 00:54:57,631
Oh, yes!
Time to fight back!

858
00:54:57,631 --> 00:55:01,503
No. You must return to
Iacon City and alert everyone.

859
00:55:04,706 --> 00:55:08,004
Embedded in this are the
records I have shown you.

860
00:55:08,004 --> 00:55:10,479
Use it to reveal the truth.

861
00:55:11,647 --> 00:55:12,844
We will.

862
00:55:12,844 --> 00:55:14,978
This tunnel leads
to the mountains.

863
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:17,849
Cybertron's future
is in your hands.

864
00:55:17,849 --> 00:55:19,345
We're out of time.

865
00:55:19,345 --> 00:55:20,984
We got to move!

866
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:23,756
Wait, we can't just
leave you here.

867
00:55:23,756 --> 00:55:26,319
Your fight will come,
my friend.

868
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:29,696
Primus has a purpose
for us all.

869
00:55:29,696 --> 00:55:31,632
But this fight...

870
00:55:31,632 --> 00:55:33,535
This fight is mine.

871
00:55:33,535 --> 00:55:36,032
Now go!

872
00:55:47,045 --> 00:55:48,451
Stand down, old timer.

873
00:55:48,451 --> 00:55:51,454
Ah. Old, you say?

874
00:56:21,277 --> 00:56:23,244
Not too old for you.

875
00:56:29,087 --> 00:56:30,251
We need to hurry!

876
00:56:30,251 --> 00:56:31,956
I still think
we have better odds

877
00:56:31,956 --> 00:56:33,727
fighting than outrunning them.

878
00:56:33,727 --> 00:56:36,763
Wait! We have cogs.
We can transform now.

879
00:56:36,763 --> 00:56:39,733
- That's right. Everyone ready?
- I was born ready.

880
00:56:39,733 --> 00:56:41,394
On three. One--

881
00:56:49,976 --> 00:56:50,876
Ah!

882
00:56:56,684 --> 00:56:58,213
How do we use these things?

883
00:56:58,213 --> 00:57:00,149
I don't know. Just try.

884
00:57:02,052 --> 00:57:04,725
It's working. Ha! It's working!

885
00:57:05,486 --> 00:57:06,562
My head! My head!

886
00:57:06,562 --> 00:57:07,629
Whoa!

887
00:57:07,629 --> 00:57:09,466
Help! Help!

888
00:57:14,132 --> 00:57:16,671
This is not faster!

889
00:57:19,806 --> 00:57:21,577
Oh, come on!

890
00:57:21,577 --> 00:57:24,679
And transform!

891
00:57:26,978 --> 00:57:28,716
Wheels! I need wheels!

892
00:57:38,519 --> 00:57:39,419
Whoa.

893
00:58:00,145 --> 00:58:02,684
Ha!

894
00:58:05,621 --> 00:58:07,150
Oh, wow.

895
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:08,690
- We're alive!
- I've never moved that fast.

896
00:58:08,690 --> 00:58:11,484
- That was incredible!
- Did you see me slide all over?

897
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:19,932
Yes!

898
00:58:22,968 --> 00:58:24,530
Hey, whoa, buddy.
You okay?

899
00:58:24,530 --> 00:58:28,204
I'm great. Are you kidding me?
We can transform!

900
00:58:28,204 --> 00:58:30,371
We transform!

901
00:58:30,371 --> 00:58:32,010
Oh, hey! I know.

902
00:58:32,010 --> 00:58:34,111
We're wasting time.
We have to get back to Iacon.

903
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:35,310
Looks like the fastest way

904
00:58:35,310 --> 00:58:37,048
- back to Iacon is--
- Here, I got it.

905
00:58:37,048 --> 00:58:38,544
Hey, what are you doing?

906
00:58:38,544 --> 00:58:40,249
- Don't worry, I got it.
- Yeah, but be careful.

907
00:58:40,249 --> 00:58:43,087
Our proof is inside and
you're spilling it everywhere.

908
00:58:44,387 --> 00:58:49,764
I... got... it.

909
00:58:51,768 --> 00:58:53,031
Okay.

910
00:58:56,938 --> 00:58:58,300
Follow me.

911
00:59:05,241 --> 00:59:07,408
Alpha Trion!

912
00:59:07,408 --> 00:59:10,246
You are still alive.
Would you look at that?

913
00:59:11,117 --> 00:59:13,051
You look horrible.

914
00:59:13,823 --> 00:59:18,188
Traitor.
You are a disgrace.

915
00:59:18,188 --> 00:59:21,455
- Primus will surely--
- Uh-huh. Yes. Shut up.

916
00:59:21,455 --> 00:59:25,261
I seized an opportunity
to take control of my future.

917
00:59:25,261 --> 00:59:26,735
Anything to get
out of working for you

918
00:59:26,735 --> 00:59:29,100
and that boring
council of elders.

919
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:31,300
Seriously,
I would watch you Primes

920
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:33,434
spend half the day
losing a war

921
00:59:33,434 --> 00:59:38,274
and the other half sitting around
waxing poetic about loyalty and honor.

922
00:59:38,274 --> 00:59:39,572
And now look at you.

923
00:59:39,572 --> 00:59:43,411
Hear my words:
You will fall.

924
00:59:43,411 --> 00:59:45,479
And a new Prime will rise--

925
00:59:45,479 --> 00:59:47,019
There you go again.

926
00:59:47,019 --> 00:59:49,956
I don't want to listen
to any more speeches.

927
00:59:51,287 --> 00:59:52,761
There were others
in the cave with you.

928
00:59:52,761 --> 00:59:53,828
Who are they?

929
00:59:53,828 --> 00:59:56,963
They are to be your undoing.

930
00:59:56,963 --> 01:00:01,396
You've lost, Sentinel.
Nothing you can do--

931
01:00:07,371 --> 01:00:10,504
Oh, didn't I just say
no speeches?

932
01:00:10,504 --> 01:00:12,143
You heard me, right?

933
01:00:12,143 --> 01:00:14,574
This is what I'm talking about.
Unbelievable.

934
01:00:14,574 --> 01:00:17,478
All of them are like that.
So disrespectful.

935
01:00:19,084 --> 01:00:21,317
Okay. Hunt down the others.

936
01:00:21,317 --> 01:00:22,659
With pleasure.

937
01:00:39,304 --> 01:00:40,501
Hey, buddy.

938
01:00:41,174 --> 01:00:42,536
Oh. Hey.

939
01:00:44,210 --> 01:00:47,343
You've been a little quiet.
Are you all right?

940
01:00:47,343 --> 01:00:51,677
All I can think about
is Sentinel's smirking face.

941
01:00:51,677 --> 01:00:55,516
He must pay for what he's done.
Someone has to do something.

942
01:00:55,516 --> 01:00:59,729
We are. With Alpha's proof inside that
device, we will show everyone the truth.

943
01:00:59,729 --> 01:01:02,831
You honestly believe
it'll be that easy?

944
01:01:02,831 --> 01:01:04,833
Iacon doesn't want
to hear the truth.

945
01:01:04,833 --> 01:01:07,099
They worship Sentinel.

946
01:01:07,099 --> 01:01:09,134
There's got to be a better
way to bring him down.

947
01:01:09,134 --> 01:01:11,840
We have to trust everyone will
believe what we show them.

948
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:13,941
I trusted Sentinel!

949
01:01:14,537 --> 01:01:15,635
With everything.

950
01:01:16,814 --> 01:01:22,114
I will never trust
a so-called leader ever again.

951
01:01:24,712 --> 01:01:26,448
There's only one bot
I know I can trust--

952
01:01:37,098 --> 01:01:39,296
All right,
wake them up.

953
01:02:02,222 --> 01:02:05,487
Now, are you spies

954
01:02:06,622 --> 01:02:09,799
or just incompetent lackeys?

955
01:02:09,799 --> 01:02:12,626
- We're not spies.
- But he is incompetent.

956
01:02:12,626 --> 01:02:16,971
Scanning electrical impulses.
He speaks the truth.

957
01:02:16,971 --> 01:02:21,536
That just means he believes himself,
like any spy would.

958
01:02:23,538 --> 01:02:26,079
Uh, why is he gagged?

959
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:27,773
He wouldn't stop talking.

960
01:02:27,773 --> 01:02:29,313
Even when he was unconscious?

961
01:02:29,313 --> 01:02:31,546
Especially when
he was unconscious!

962
01:02:31,546 --> 01:02:32,789
Enough!

963
01:02:33,451 --> 01:02:35,385
Two options for you!

964
01:02:35,385 --> 01:02:40,093
One, we slowly dismantle each
of you one bolt and screw at a time,

965
01:02:40,093 --> 01:02:42,755
and really make sure
you feel it.

966
01:02:42,755 --> 01:02:43,899
Or two:

967
01:02:43,899 --> 01:02:45,692
In exchange
for a quick death,

968
01:02:45,692 --> 01:02:48,134
you give us intel
on the Energon trains,

969
01:02:48,134 --> 01:02:50,136
access to the mines

970
01:02:50,136 --> 01:02:53,843
or anything else that could
hurt your boss, Sentinel Prime.

971
01:02:53,843 --> 01:02:55,372
Who exactly are you guys?

972
01:02:57,077 --> 01:02:58,144
Ah!

973
01:02:58,144 --> 01:03:01,213
The Cybertronian High Guard!

974
01:03:01,213 --> 01:03:03,116
I told you
it wasn't tight enough!

975
01:03:03,116 --> 01:03:06,251
- Prestigious defenders of Iacon.
- Prestigious?

976
01:03:06,251 --> 01:03:08,990
He's right. I read all
about you in the archives.

977
01:03:08,990 --> 01:03:12,422
You were the most legendary
warriors in all of Cybertron.

978
01:03:12,422 --> 01:03:14,226
Look, look, look!
That's Starscream,

979
01:03:14,226 --> 01:03:17,130
and you're Shockwave,
and Soundwave.

980
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:19,759
Raise your hand if "wave" is in
your name. There's a lot of "waves."

981
01:03:19,759 --> 01:03:21,332
Silence!

982
01:03:21,332 --> 01:03:23,466
The yellow annoying one
is correct.

983
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:24,467
Whoo!

984
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:26,304
We were once the High Guard.

985
01:03:26,304 --> 01:03:30,044
We witnessed Sentinel's betrayal,
saw the Primes fall.

986
01:03:30,044 --> 01:03:32,948
Since that day, we've been
fighting from the shadows,

987
01:03:32,948 --> 01:03:35,676
doing whatever we can
to sabotage Sentinel.

988
01:03:35,676 --> 01:03:37,414
That's great! We're--
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

989
01:03:37,414 --> 01:03:41,121
Okay, okay. We're good.
Everyone relax.

990
01:03:41,121 --> 01:03:43,618
I'm just saying we're allies.

991
01:03:43,618 --> 01:03:45,686
We were on our way
back to Iacon,

992
01:03:45,686 --> 01:03:49,756
and now with your help, we can
unify Cybertron against Sentinel Prime.

993
01:03:49,756 --> 01:03:53,903
The idea of a unified
Cybertron is a myth.

994
01:03:53,903 --> 01:03:58,765
All that counts is the strength
of one bot over another!

995
01:04:00,734 --> 01:04:03,638
Okay. So, these guys
are a little intense.

996
01:04:03,638 --> 01:04:05,574
Yeah. Just a little.

997
01:04:05,574 --> 01:04:06,949
Hey!

998
01:04:06,949 --> 01:04:08,511
What are you doing?

999
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:13,747
I tell you
what I'm not doing.

1000
01:04:13,747 --> 01:04:17,685
I'm not cowering in some busted ship,
playing king of the throne.

1001
01:04:17,685 --> 01:04:19,885
I'm not pretending
like I'm making a difference

1002
01:04:19,885 --> 01:04:22,624
by throwing one punch
and then running away to hide!

1003
01:04:22,624 --> 01:04:24,890
I found out
that Sentinel is rotten today,

1004
01:04:24,890 --> 01:04:26,892
and I'm gonna
make him pay for it.

1005
01:04:26,892 --> 01:04:28,399
Today!

1006
01:04:28,399 --> 01:04:32,007
You think you can insult me
and just walk away?

1007
01:04:32,007 --> 01:04:36,044
No one leaves here
unless I say so.

1008
01:04:36,044 --> 01:04:37,705
Is that right?

1009
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:40,873
Well, how can you say so

1010
01:04:40,873 --> 01:04:42,842
with my head in your teeth?

1011
01:04:42,842 --> 01:04:44,514
D!

1012
01:04:51,424 --> 01:04:52,456
Whoa!

1013
01:04:57,595 --> 01:04:58,924
Hit me!

1014
01:04:58,924 --> 01:05:02,202
Do it! Come on! Yeah, more!

1015
01:05:02,202 --> 01:05:05,733
D-16! D-16! D-16!

1016
01:05:07,935 --> 01:05:12,905
You want to see the strength
of one bot over another? Huh?

1017
01:05:12,905 --> 01:05:14,984
Is that
all you've got, tough bot?

1018
01:05:14,984 --> 01:05:17,778
Let's go! Do it! Come on!

1019
01:05:35,435 --> 01:05:37,501
Please! I beg you!

1020
01:05:37,501 --> 01:05:40,339
Stop!
D, he's not the enemy!

1021
01:05:42,673 --> 01:05:44,805
Bear witness!

1022
01:05:44,805 --> 01:05:47,610
This is the last time
I show mercy!

1023
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:50,283
Decide right now:

1024
01:05:50,283 --> 01:05:54,914
You can stay here in hiding,
bowing before your pathetic leader,

1025
01:05:54,914 --> 01:05:58,258
or follow me
as we march on Iacon

1026
01:05:58,258 --> 01:06:01,822
and I take down Sentinel
once and for all!

1027
01:06:04,297 --> 01:06:08,895
D-16! D-16! D-16!

1028
01:06:35,759 --> 01:06:36,989
B, come on!

1029
01:07:02,016 --> 01:07:04,786
Engage all hostiles!
I've got the bridge!

1030
01:07:36,556 --> 01:07:37,456
Elita, get down!

1031
01:08:00,074 --> 01:08:02,712
I feel like someone
dropped a cliff on me.

1032
01:08:02,712 --> 01:08:05,253
Where are the others?

1033
01:08:05,253 --> 01:08:09,048
Sentinel's troops took as many
prisoners as they could carry.

1034
01:08:09,048 --> 01:08:10,852
They got D-16 and B.

1035
01:08:10,852 --> 01:08:12,722
Oh, no.

1036
01:08:12,722 --> 01:08:15,296
And half of those
High-Guard nutjobs.

1037
01:08:17,298 --> 01:08:19,025
Our proof.

1038
01:08:19,025 --> 01:08:20,466
It's gone.

1039
01:08:21,337 --> 01:08:23,601
So, what do we do now?

1040
01:08:23,601 --> 01:08:25,207
D was right.

1041
01:08:25,207 --> 01:08:27,803
- About what?
- Everything.

1042
01:08:27,803 --> 01:08:31,444
Look at it. Look around.
This is a disaster.

1043
01:08:32,007 --> 01:08:33,182
It's all my fault.

1044
01:08:33,182 --> 01:08:35,107
I should have
stayed on protocol.

1045
01:08:41,390 --> 01:08:44,787
Listen to me.
I really want you to hear this.

1046
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:45,854
Are you listening?

1047
01:08:48,463 --> 01:08:49,858
I'm better than you.

1048
01:08:50,861 --> 01:08:52,498
Yeah, okay,
I'm hearing you.

1049
01:08:53,369 --> 01:08:55,127
I'm better than you
in every way,

1050
01:08:55,127 --> 01:08:57,635
except you have hope.

1051
01:08:57,635 --> 01:09:01,342
You always have. You went back
into the mine to rescue Jazz.

1052
01:09:01,342 --> 01:09:05,313
You snuck up to the surface
to find the Matrix of Leadership.

1053
01:09:05,313 --> 01:09:07,139
Yeah,
and how'd that work out?

1054
01:09:07,139 --> 01:09:08,910
My point is,

1055
01:09:08,910 --> 01:09:13,178
that your instincts tell you
to break protocol for a reason.

1056
01:09:13,178 --> 01:09:16,291
This blind optimism
that you have

1057
01:09:16,291 --> 01:09:20,658
is why you make such bold
and courageous choices,

1058
01:09:21,727 --> 01:09:23,529
that are also extremely stupid.

1059
01:09:23,529 --> 01:09:26,092
First time
giving a pep talk?

1060
01:09:26,092 --> 01:09:27,863
You're inspiring.

1061
01:09:27,863 --> 01:09:31,240
You can envision a better future
that no one else can see.

1062
01:09:32,309 --> 01:09:35,343
And if we ever want to see
B and D-16 again,

1063
01:09:35,343 --> 01:09:39,380
that is the Orion Pax
that we need right now.

1064
01:09:40,581 --> 01:09:41,613
Listen to me.

1065
01:09:42,517 --> 01:09:43,714
We can do this.

1066
01:09:45,751 --> 01:09:49,390
Those Energon trains will
be heading back to Iacon.

1067
01:09:49,390 --> 01:09:52,118
If we intercepted one--

1068
01:09:52,118 --> 01:09:55,330
Hell yes, I can reroute it.
What else do we need?

1069
01:09:55,330 --> 01:10:00,060
Well, my bold instincts tell me
we have to recruit some nutjobs.

1070
01:10:02,097 --> 01:10:04,405
I was afraid
you'd say that.

1071
01:10:04,405 --> 01:10:08,002
Uh, Shockwave, Soundwave.
You in the back.

1072
01:10:08,002 --> 01:10:11,280
In order to save our captured friends,
we have to act now.

1073
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:13,579
How about I blast you
back to Iacon?

1074
01:10:13,579 --> 01:10:17,011
Oh! She punched me in my eye!

1075
01:10:17,011 --> 01:10:20,256
Everyone, shut up!
All of you. Listen to him.

1076
01:10:21,721 --> 01:10:24,084
Most likely, our friends
are being held captive

1077
01:10:24,084 --> 01:10:25,756
at the top
of Sentinel's tower.

1078
01:10:25,756 --> 01:10:28,792
A surprise attack would
give us a chance to rescue them.

1079
01:10:28,792 --> 01:10:33,764
Impossible. We do not have
enough soldiers or a way inside.

1080
01:10:33,764 --> 01:10:36,932
Elita will get us in.
And I will get more troops.

1081
01:10:36,932 --> 01:10:38,571
Why should we follow you?

1082
01:10:39,739 --> 01:10:41,409
We will follow you.

1083
01:10:41,409 --> 01:10:44,643
Attention, High Guard.
Prepare for battle.

1084
01:10:44,643 --> 01:10:46,678
What is our first move?

1085
01:10:46,678 --> 01:10:47,844
We roll out.

1086
01:10:49,419 --> 01:10:50,451
What?

1087
01:10:50,451 --> 01:10:51,881
Louder.

1088
01:10:51,881 --> 01:10:54,323
Transform and roll out!

1089
01:11:04,225 --> 01:11:07,864
I don't understand.
Why are we still alive?

1090
01:11:07,864 --> 01:11:11,472
Look at this rowdy bunch!
The High Guard!

1091
01:11:11,472 --> 01:11:13,342
You know, you guys
have been tough to find.

1092
01:11:13,342 --> 01:11:16,939
Every trip to the surface,
I've been searching for you.

1093
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:19,480
Tracking the bots in the cave
led me right to them.

1094
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:20,811
Oh-ho-ho!

1095
01:11:20,811 --> 01:11:23,748
- You captured Starscream!
- It was too easy.

1096
01:11:23,748 --> 01:11:25,948
I'm going to
rip you apart piece by piece

1097
01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:27,455
so that your death
is painful!

1098
01:11:27,455 --> 01:11:28,753
You'll regret
the day you were--

1099
01:11:28,753 --> 01:11:30,722
You sound ridiculous.
It's weird.

1100
01:11:30,722 --> 01:11:33,758
Oh, D-16,
what a tragic story you'll be.

1101
01:11:33,758 --> 01:11:37,663
Atop the leaderboard in your
sector and secretly a traitor.

1102
01:11:37,663 --> 01:11:39,764
I'm not a traitor.
You're the traitor.

1103
01:11:39,764 --> 01:11:42,503
Nuh-uh. You, all of you,
are traitors.

1104
01:11:42,503 --> 01:11:46,199
You've been working with the
Quintessons to sabotage my expeditions.

1105
01:11:46,199 --> 01:11:48,641
You're the reason why I haven't
found the Matrix of Leadership yet.

1106
01:11:48,641 --> 01:11:49,939
None of that is true!

1107
01:11:49,939 --> 01:11:51,545
Oh, trust me,
it'll be very true

1108
01:11:51,545 --> 01:11:54,482
when I'm executing you
in front of all of Iacon.

1109
01:11:54,482 --> 01:11:58,310
Because down here,
the truth is what I make it.

1110
01:12:07,057 --> 01:12:09,464
Well, well.
What's this about?

1111
01:12:10,324 --> 01:12:13,028
I'm not kneeling
in front of you.

1112
01:12:13,028 --> 01:12:14,997
Feeling confident, are we?

1113
01:12:14,997 --> 01:12:18,231
You don't scare me.
You want to know why?

1114
01:12:18,231 --> 01:12:19,331
Please.

1115
01:12:20,543 --> 01:12:23,577
Because I don't have
anything left to lose.

1116
01:12:23,577 --> 01:12:25,744
You took it all.

1117
01:12:27,110 --> 01:12:28,483
I sure did.

1118
01:12:31,552 --> 01:12:33,950
Ah, Megatronus Prime.

1119
01:12:35,349 --> 01:12:38,427
Of course you were a fan.
Megatronus was the coolest Prime!

1120
01:12:38,427 --> 01:12:41,320
The biggest!
The baddest! The toughest!

1121
01:12:42,565 --> 01:12:44,796
That's why,
after I killed him,

1122
01:12:45,832 --> 01:12:48,063
I took his cog for myself.

1123
01:12:48,063 --> 01:12:50,571
He was greater
than you'll ever be!

1124
01:12:50,571 --> 01:12:52,870
I don't know. I'm pretty great.

1125
01:12:52,870 --> 01:12:55,741
But I can understand why you'd
want to wear his face over mine.

1126
01:12:55,741 --> 01:12:56,808
Here.

1127
01:12:58,042 --> 01:13:01,274
Let's make sure
it doesn't come off.

1128
01:13:20,031 --> 01:13:22,570
Okay.

1129
01:13:22,570 --> 01:13:25,133
I can do this.

1130
01:13:38,786 --> 01:13:42,282
You can't be serious. We
just worked 22 shifts without a break!

1131
01:13:42,282 --> 01:13:44,020
These miners need rest
and time to repair and--

1132
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:46,319
Sentinel Prime
wants more Energon.

1133
01:13:46,319 --> 01:13:49,762
So get back in the mines before
I make you get back in the--

1134
01:13:55,427 --> 01:13:57,429
- Who was that?
- Did you see who that was?

1135
01:13:57,429 --> 01:13:58,639
That can't be him.

1136
01:13:58,639 --> 01:13:59,739
Is that...

1137
01:14:00,841 --> 01:14:02,434
It can't be.

1138
01:14:02,434 --> 01:14:04,975
- Orion?
- Jazz.

1139
01:14:04,975 --> 01:14:06,405
Is it really you?

1140
01:14:06,405 --> 01:14:08,814
Yeah, I know I, uh,
look a little different.

1141
01:14:08,814 --> 01:14:10,409
"Little"?

1142
01:14:10,409 --> 01:14:12,246
There's nothing
"little" about you.

1143
01:14:12,246 --> 01:14:14,116
Uh, how is this possible?

1144
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:16,954
Sentinel told us you died
from your race injuries.

1145
01:14:17,792 --> 01:14:19,924
Sentinel is a liar.

1146
01:14:19,924 --> 01:14:21,959
- What?
- Huh?

1147
01:14:21,959 --> 01:14:24,126
Look, I know how this will sound
coming from me.

1148
01:14:24,126 --> 01:14:27,635
I was never
the most focused miner.

1149
01:14:27,635 --> 01:14:30,099
But as you can see,
everything is different now.

1150
01:14:37,944 --> 01:14:42,177
I went to the surface
and I learned the truth.

1151
01:14:43,653 --> 01:14:45,312
My friends,

1152
01:14:45,312 --> 01:14:49,415
we were all born
with transformation cogs.

1153
01:14:50,451 --> 01:14:53,628
And then Sentinel,
he stole them from us.

1154
01:14:53,628 --> 01:14:57,027
He took away our ability
to make our own decisions.

1155
01:14:57,027 --> 01:14:59,194
He stole our freedom.

1156
01:15:03,002 --> 01:15:08,841
But now, I'm offering you
your first real choice.

1157
01:15:08,841 --> 01:15:12,977
You can work a 23rd shift
and mine yourself to death

1158
01:15:14,684 --> 01:15:17,509
or fight back
against Sentinel with me.

1159
01:15:18,050 --> 01:15:20,182
Right now.

1160
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:23,559
- How are we supposed to do that?
- We can't fight. We don't have cogs.

1161
01:15:25,893 --> 01:15:29,829
What defines a Transformer
is not the cog in its chest

1162
01:15:29,829 --> 01:15:32,799
but the spark
that resides in their core.

1163
01:15:32,799 --> 01:15:36,968
A spark that gives you the will
to make your world better.

1164
01:15:36,968 --> 01:15:40,840
And that spark,
Sentinel can never take from us.

1165
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:43,238
There's not enough of us.
We'd need an army.

1166
01:15:43,238 --> 01:15:47,011
And we have one.
Elita is bringing troops.

1167
01:15:47,011 --> 01:15:49,079
We are not alone in this.

1168
01:15:49,079 --> 01:15:51,884
If we want to be in control
of our own destiny,

1169
01:15:51,884 --> 01:15:53,545
we will have to
fight for it.

1170
01:15:53,545 --> 01:15:56,922
Now is the time
for us to stand up...

1171
01:15:56,922 --> 01:15:58,924
...for ourselves.

1172
01:16:01,258 --> 01:16:03,192
Stand up for this injustice.

1173
01:16:05,392 --> 01:16:09,099
I promise you
this fight will be worth it.

1174
01:16:10,036 --> 01:16:11,772
Follow me.

1175
01:16:11,772 --> 01:16:14,676
Nothing can stop us
when we stand together.

1176
01:16:14,676 --> 01:16:18,207
Together as one.

1177
01:16:18,207 --> 01:16:22,717
Orion Pax! Orion Pax! Orion Pax!

1178
01:16:22,717 --> 01:16:25,214
<i>Elita, it's time.</i>

1179
01:16:25,214 --> 01:16:26,545
You got it.

1180
01:16:26,545 --> 01:16:28,822
Buckle up, Blinky.
We're going in.

1181
01:16:42,233 --> 01:16:43,463
Not a good idea.

1182
01:16:45,632 --> 01:16:47,808
D, stay down.

1183
01:16:59,613 --> 01:17:01,448
Well, that's a shame.

1184
01:17:01,448 --> 01:17:03,417
You really were
a great miner.

1185
01:17:07,929 --> 01:17:10,358
We've got a breach!
Protect Sentinel!

1186
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:22,172
They spotted us.
It's about to get bumpy.

1187
01:17:23,109 --> 01:17:24,812
High Guard, eject.

1188
01:17:24,812 --> 01:17:26,781
Come on! Move out!

1189
01:17:41,655 --> 01:17:43,798
There's
too many. We have to abort!

1190
01:17:49,432 --> 01:17:50,497
We're not gonna make it.

1191
01:17:53,370 --> 01:17:54,336
Whoo-hoo!

1192
01:17:54,336 --> 01:17:55,942
Metal to the pedal, miners!

1193
01:17:55,942 --> 01:17:57,702
Let's break some protocol!

1194
01:17:57,702 --> 01:17:59,473
That's what
I'm talking about, Pax!

1195
01:18:09,021 --> 01:18:11,386
Whoa! That's intense.

1196
01:18:11,386 --> 01:18:16,094
You can't win, miner.
I see everything!

1197
01:18:17,361 --> 01:18:18,998
That's right, you do.

1198
01:18:18,998 --> 01:18:21,737
Except the tower we're
about to crash into.

1199
01:18:34,708 --> 01:18:36,378
What's going on?

1200
01:18:40,547 --> 01:18:41,757
Hey!

1201
01:18:47,226 --> 01:18:49,028
What has he done to you?

1202
01:18:49,028 --> 01:18:51,899
This is nothing compared to
what I'm gonna do to Sentinel.

1203
01:18:52,836 --> 01:18:55,100
Soundwave,
free the prisoners.

1204
01:18:59,766 --> 01:19:02,107
I know how to stop him.
Airachnid is the answer.

1205
01:19:02,107 --> 01:19:03,878
- I'm doing this my way.
- D!

1206
01:19:09,413 --> 01:19:10,445
Yes!

1207
01:19:10,445 --> 01:19:11,512
Whoa!

1208
01:19:11,512 --> 01:19:13,052
Whoa-ho-ho!

1209
01:19:13,052 --> 01:19:14,416
I got a battle mask!

1210
01:19:16,154 --> 01:19:18,090
Elita! Battle mask!

1211
01:19:18,090 --> 01:19:21,060
It appeared
when this guy tried to--

1212
01:19:21,060 --> 01:19:23,095
Knife hands?
I have knife hands!

1213
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:27,165
What the--?

1214
01:19:30,168 --> 01:19:31,972
Badassatron.

1215
01:19:37,276 --> 01:19:39,177
Where's Sentinel?

1216
01:19:41,885 --> 01:19:43,984
You pathetic little twits.

1217
01:19:43,984 --> 01:19:48,318
Did you really think that you could
knock down everything I've built?

1218
01:19:48,318 --> 01:19:52,157
- It's over, Sentinel. You can't escape the truth.
- What truth?

1219
01:19:52,157 --> 01:19:54,863
That I plucked the cogs
from your newborn chests?

1220
01:19:54,863 --> 01:19:57,063
Forced you to mine so that I
could pay off the Quintessons

1221
01:19:57,063 --> 01:19:58,427
and live like a king?

1222
01:19:58,427 --> 01:20:01,430
None of that matters!
Because the truth...

1223
01:20:01,430 --> 01:20:05,434
...is what I make it.

1224
01:20:07,636 --> 01:20:08,536
Incoming!

1225
01:20:10,441 --> 01:20:11,704
Whoa!

1226
01:20:15,479 --> 01:20:17,116
- He's too strong.
- I have a plan.

1227
01:20:17,116 --> 01:20:19,316
- We need Airachnid.
- Airachnid?

1228
01:20:19,316 --> 01:20:21,582
- We need her memory.
- Where is she?

1229
01:20:21,582 --> 01:20:23,188
Found her!

1230
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:25,685
Elita!

1231
01:20:26,556 --> 01:20:27,962
<i>Do not break her.</i>

1232
01:20:27,962 --> 01:20:29,293
<i>Bring her
to the broadcast station.</i>

1233
01:20:29,293 --> 01:20:30,525
<i>We'll meet you there.</i>

1234
01:20:30,525 --> 01:20:32,494
Easier said than done.

1235
01:20:51,548 --> 01:20:52,811
<i>I said, don't break her!</i>

1236
01:20:52,811 --> 01:20:55,847
Relax! I'm being very gentle.

1237
01:21:00,161 --> 01:21:03,030
Orion! Orion, look!
I have knife hands!

1238
01:21:03,030 --> 01:21:04,625
I can see that.

1239
01:21:04,625 --> 01:21:06,825
I'm gonna cut these guys.
Watch. Come here!

1240
01:21:06,825 --> 01:21:08,695
You can jab them later.
We got to go.

1241
01:21:12,041 --> 01:21:13,073
Yeah!

1242
01:21:32,356 --> 01:21:34,589
Uh, excuse me.
You can't be in here.

1243
01:21:41,862 --> 01:21:43,532
B!

1244
01:21:43,532 --> 01:21:46,370
- These are not the bad guys.
- Why did you cut the door?

1245
01:21:46,370 --> 01:21:49,010
What? No, I didn't--
That was an-- I--

1246
01:21:49,010 --> 01:21:50,638
It was already like that.
Right?

1247
01:21:50,638 --> 01:21:51,980
- Yes, that's right.
- That's right, yes.

1248
01:21:51,980 --> 01:21:54,081
- Yeah, it was already like--
- Yes. Mm-hmm.

1249
01:21:58,747 --> 01:22:00,615
<i>Attention, Iacon City.</i>

1250
01:22:00,615 --> 01:22:03,992
<i>Stand by for a live
transmission from Sentinel Prime.</i>

1251
01:22:09,791 --> 01:22:11,362
What's wrong, D-16?

1252
01:22:12,299 --> 01:22:13,463
Rise up!

1253
01:22:17,172 --> 01:22:19,106
<i>That's why after I killed him--</i>

1254
01:22:19,106 --> 01:22:23,242
<i>That's why after I killed him,
I took his cog for myself.</i>

1255
01:22:23,242 --> 01:22:25,574
<i>...cog for myself.</i>

1256
01:22:25,574 --> 01:22:29,413
<i>What truth? That I plucked the
cogs from your newborn chests?</i>

1257
01:22:29,413 --> 01:22:31,118
<i>Forced you to mine
so that I could pay off</i>

1258
01:22:31,118 --> 01:22:32,977
<i>the Quintessons
and live like a king?</i>

1259
01:22:32,977 --> 01:22:34,682
<i>What truth?</i>

1260
01:22:34,682 --> 01:22:36,618
<i>That I plucked the cogs
from your newborn chests?</i>

1261
01:22:36,618 --> 01:22:38,323
<i>Forced you to mine
so that I could pay off</i>

1262
01:22:38,323 --> 01:22:40,490
<i>the Quintessons
and live like a king?</i>

1263
01:22:40,490 --> 01:22:42,327
<i>I'm working my miners
as hard as I can.</i>

1264
01:22:42,327 --> 01:22:45,297
<i>I swear I will
get you the rest!</i>

1265
01:22:45,297 --> 01:22:47,464
<i>I'm working my miners
as hard as I can.</i>

1266
01:22:47,464 --> 01:22:50,269
<i>I swear I will get you
the rest!</i>

1267
01:22:50,269 --> 01:22:52,634
<i>I'm working my miners
as hard as I can, I swear--</i>

1268
01:22:52,634 --> 01:22:54,273
Liar!

1269
01:22:57,036 --> 01:22:58,937
We trusted you!

1270
01:22:59,610 --> 01:23:00,642
Traitor!

1271
01:23:00,642 --> 01:23:02,710
Pax, we did it.

1272
01:23:14,328 --> 01:23:15,492
D!

1273
01:23:43,390 --> 01:23:44,422
D-16.

1274
01:23:45,260 --> 01:23:47,722
We can lead Cybertron together!

1275
01:23:47,722 --> 01:23:49,130
Don't do this!

1276
01:23:55,367 --> 01:23:56,533
What are you doing?

1277
01:23:56,533 --> 01:23:58,172
It's over, D.

1278
01:23:58,172 --> 01:24:00,339
Everyone in Iacon
knows the truth.

1279
01:24:00,339 --> 01:24:02,000
So do I!

1280
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,179
He took everything from us!
I have to do this!

1281
01:24:05,179 --> 01:24:06,840
No, you don't.

1282
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:10,547
Rebuilding Iacon cannot
begin with an execution.

1283
01:24:10,547 --> 01:24:13,077
He deserves to die!
Can't you see that?

1284
01:24:13,077 --> 01:24:16,091
We're better than this.
Don't be like Sentinel.

1285
01:24:18,051 --> 01:24:19,754
Pax,

1286
01:24:19,754 --> 01:24:23,824
you need to move out of my
way before I move you myself.

1287
01:24:23,824 --> 01:24:26,024
D, listen--

1288
01:24:34,133 --> 01:24:35,407
Stop!

1289
01:24:47,289 --> 01:24:48,387
No!

1290
01:24:48,387 --> 01:24:50,455
No, no, no, no. Why?

1291
01:24:51,524 --> 01:24:53,887
Why did you do that? Why?

1292
01:25:03,303 --> 01:25:05,998
D, no.

1293
01:25:12,072 --> 01:25:13,544
I'm done saving you.

1294
01:26:53,448 --> 01:26:56,482
The Age of Primes has ended!

1295
01:26:56,482 --> 01:26:58,847
No more false prophets!

1296
01:26:58,847 --> 01:27:03,115
Follow me and you will
never again be deceived.

1297
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:06,459
Rise up!

1298
01:27:06,459 --> 01:27:08,527
Rise up! Rise up!

1299
01:27:08,527 --> 01:27:11,728
Rise up! Rise up!
Rise up!

1300
01:27:11,728 --> 01:27:14,093
<i>Orion Pax,</i>

1301
01:27:14,093 --> 01:27:17,228
<i>your noble sacrifice
for the greater good</i>

1302
01:27:17,228 --> 01:27:21,276
<i>has proven you worthy
in the eyes of Primus.</i>

1303
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:24,543
<i>He entrusts in you</i>

1304
01:27:24,543 --> 01:27:27,447
the future of Cybertron

1305
01:27:27,447 --> 01:27:33,079
and the Matrix of Leadership!

1306
01:27:34,278 --> 01:27:37,688
I will lead us all
into the future!

1307
01:27:54,707 --> 01:27:55,772
I...

1308
01:27:56,544 --> 01:27:57,609
am...

1309
01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:00,315
Megatron!

1310
01:28:01,010 --> 01:28:02,944
<i>Arise...</i>

1311
01:28:03,650 --> 01:28:06,079
<i>Optimus Prime.</i>

1312
01:28:09,051 --> 01:28:10,952
Burn it down!

1313
01:28:11,625 --> 01:28:12,954
All of it!

1314
01:28:18,357 --> 01:28:21,534
All hail Megatron!

1315
01:28:23,439 --> 01:28:25,934
- He's gonna kill everyone.
- We have to stop him. Come on.

1316
01:28:27,443 --> 01:28:29,135
Stop! It's over.

1317
01:28:29,135 --> 01:28:32,908
It's over when every last one
of his followers is dead!

1318
01:29:06,372 --> 01:29:07,844
Impossible.

1319
01:29:10,519 --> 01:29:14,378
Primus gave you the Matrix.

1320
01:29:14,378 --> 01:29:16,589
We could've built
the future together.

1321
01:29:16,589 --> 01:29:18,624
I'll build it myself.

1322
01:29:18,624 --> 01:29:22,221
After I tear down
everyone in my way!

1323
01:30:03,803 --> 01:30:04,835
Ah!

1324
01:31:06,965 --> 01:31:10,164
We were given the power
to change our world

1325
01:31:10,164 --> 01:31:12,672
and you chose to destroy it.

1326
01:31:12,672 --> 01:31:14,135
Just like Sentinel.

1327
01:31:14,135 --> 01:31:18,007
You have betrayed Cybertron
and its citizens.

1328
01:31:19,681 --> 01:31:22,473
And you betrayed me.

1329
01:31:33,552 --> 01:31:34,628
Go.

1330
01:31:35,488 --> 01:31:38,159
Take the High Guard
and leave.

1331
01:31:39,393 --> 01:31:42,999
You are banished from Iacon.

1332
01:31:47,874 --> 01:31:50,204
It didn't have to end
this way.

1333
01:31:52,538 --> 01:31:56,012
This isn't over, Prime.

1334
01:32:03,351 --> 01:32:05,923
High Guard, follow me!

1335
01:32:19,532 --> 01:32:22,071
<i>The line
between friend and enemy</i>

1336
01:32:22,071 --> 01:32:25,239
<i>is not as clear
as I once believed.</i>

1337
01:32:25,239 --> 01:32:29,177
<i>Once it's crossed,
there's no going back.</i>

1338
01:32:29,177 --> 01:32:33,214
<i>Because some transformations
are permanent.</i>

1339
01:32:33,214 --> 01:32:35,084
Hey, Megatronus Prime.
Nice.

1340
01:32:35,084 --> 01:32:37,251
Oh, yeah.
Well, he's my hero.

1341
01:32:37,251 --> 01:32:39,088
The greatest Prime
to ever live.

1342
01:32:40,826 --> 01:32:43,587
- I'm D-16.
- Orion Pax.

1343
01:32:43,587 --> 01:32:45,996
You ever mine Energon before?

1344
01:32:45,996 --> 01:32:47,393
No. You?

1345
01:32:47,393 --> 01:32:49,604
No. I hear it's dangerous.

1346
01:32:50,299 --> 01:32:51,705
Well, I'll tell you what.

1347
01:32:51,705 --> 01:32:54,235
You watch my back,
I promise to watch yours.

1348
01:32:54,235 --> 01:32:55,434
All right.

1349
01:32:56,041 --> 01:32:58,272
Thanks, Pax.

1350
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:13,617
A new beginning
for Cybertron.

1351
01:33:13,617 --> 01:33:15,729
And a new leader.

1352
01:33:15,729 --> 01:33:17,731
Yes, about that.

1353
01:33:17,731 --> 01:33:22,736
I could use some help from a bot
who is better than me in every way.

1354
01:33:22,736 --> 01:33:24,705
Who, me? Oh, no, no.

1355
01:33:24,705 --> 01:33:27,103
I have a pretty sweet gig
working in waste management.

1356
01:33:27,103 --> 01:33:30,106
Well, Captain,
I do owe you a promotion.

1357
01:33:30,106 --> 01:33:32,878
How's Major Elita sound?

1358
01:33:32,878 --> 01:33:35,441
How about Commander?

1359
01:33:35,441 --> 01:33:37,410
Even better.

1360
01:33:37,410 --> 01:33:41,381
And I'm sorry, B, but I cannot
let you go back to sublevel 50.

1361
01:33:41,381 --> 01:33:43,218
I may be a Prime now,

1362
01:33:43,218 --> 01:33:44,956
but I'm gonna need you
by my side.

1363
01:33:44,956 --> 01:33:48,454
Are you serious? This is
the greatest day of my life.

1364
01:33:48,454 --> 01:33:50,654
I get to work
for the government.

1365
01:33:50,654 --> 01:33:54,295
Okay. So that's new.

1366
01:33:54,295 --> 01:33:55,967
I'm sorry,
what is happening?

1367
01:34:26,395 --> 01:34:30,133
<i>And now we
stand here together as one...</i>

1368
01:34:32,533 --> 01:34:35,666
<i>proving we all have
the power to transform,</i>

1369
01:34:35,666 --> 01:34:38,911
<i>to become
who we were destined to be,</i>

1370
01:34:38,911 --> 01:34:43,608
<i>to right wrongs,
to make our world better.</i>

1371
01:34:43,608 --> 01:34:46,787
<i>Because here,
freedom and autonomy</i>

1372
01:34:46,787 --> 01:34:49,515
<i>are the rights
of all sentient beings.</i>

1373
01:34:50,617 --> 01:34:55,092
<i>Here,
all are truly Autobots.</i>

1374
01:34:56,557 --> 01:35:00,163
<i>This message is a warning
to all Quintessons.</i>

1375
01:35:00,163 --> 01:35:05,564
<i>If you dare return to Cybertron,
the Autobots will be waiting.</i>

1376
01:35:05,564 --> 01:35:08,501
<i>I will be waiting.</i>

1377
01:35:08,501 --> 01:35:12,340
<i>I am Optimus Prime.</i>

1378
01:35:40,203 --> 01:35:42,700
Hey, guys! Great news,
the Energon's back!

1379
01:35:42,700 --> 01:35:44,977
And I have a cog
and I can transform!

1380
01:35:44,977 --> 01:35:46,913
It's a long story.
I'll fill you in later.

1381
01:35:46,913 --> 01:35:50,477
Oh! And here's the best part.
My hands are straight-up knives.

1382
01:35:50,477 --> 01:35:52,314
Watch this. Knife hands!

1383
01:35:54,219 --> 01:35:55,251
No!

1384
01:43:20,093 --> 01:43:23,996
<i>Sentinel the betrayer is dead.</i>

1385
01:43:23,996 --> 01:43:27,736
<i>But his death has given life
to a new enemy.</i>

1386
01:43:27,736 --> 01:43:29,936
<i>A stronger enemy.</i>

1387
01:43:29,936 --> 01:43:32,070
<i>A personal enemy.</i>

1388
01:43:33,205 --> 01:43:37,383
<i>We will not be blinded
by his deception.</i>

1389
01:43:37,383 --> 01:43:40,045
<i>We are the ones who are...</i>

1390
01:43:40,883 --> 01:43:42,883
Decepticons!

1391
01:43:42,883 --> 01:43:44,720
Rise up!

1392
01:43:44,720 --> 01:43:48,218
Rise up! Rise up!
