1
00:00:01,395 --> 00:00:03,291
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,596
After 5 years in Hell,
I returned home

3
00:00:05,597 --> 00:00:08,064
with only one goal--
to save my city.

4
00:00:08,065 --> 00:00:09,865
But I couldn't honor that
commitment

5
00:00:09,867 --> 00:00:12,968
and honor the promise I made
to the mother of my son,

6
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:15,103
so I asked the best man I know
to help.

7
00:00:15,105 --> 00:00:16,671
His name is John Diggle,

8
00:00:16,673 --> 00:00:20,308
and he is the Green Arrow.

9
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,043
Previously on "Arrow"...

10
00:00:22,045 --> 00:00:24,145
Could you tutor me
some more before the test?

11
00:00:24,147 --> 00:00:25,146
See you soon.

12
00:00:25,148 --> 00:00:26,548
She's pretty cool.

13
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:30,018
His life will be better
with you in it

14
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,120
just like mine.

15
00:00:32,122 --> 00:00:34,422
Cayden James--he's the most skilled hacker
the world has ever known.

16
00:00:34,424 --> 00:00:35,924
8 months ago, he was
scooped up by Argus,

17
00:00:35,926 --> 00:00:38,159
and now he's being held
without cause,

18
00:00:38,161 --> 00:00:39,895
being tortured,
who knows what else?

19
00:00:39,897 --> 00:00:41,563
Helix is about to extract
Cayden James.

20
00:00:41,565 --> 00:00:42,631
-1...
-2...

21
00:00:42,633 --> 00:00:43,798
3.

22
00:00:45,502 --> 00:00:47,669
Bad Laurel--
she wasn't dead

23
00:00:47,671 --> 00:00:49,871
when we found her
back on Lian Yu.

24
00:01:19,636 --> 00:01:21,836
Buy you a drink?

25
00:01:21,838 --> 00:01:24,639
Whiskey, neat.

26
00:01:24,641 --> 00:01:26,274
Are you waiting
for someone?

27
00:01:26,276 --> 00:01:29,811
Is it too cheesy
if I say you?

28
00:01:29,813 --> 00:01:32,814
I'll let it slide
this time.

29
00:01:32,816 --> 00:01:35,350
What about you?

30
00:01:35,352 --> 00:01:37,519
Let me guess.
You're a numbers guy.

31
00:01:37,521 --> 00:01:39,054
You sit in front
of a computer all day,

32
00:01:39,056 --> 00:01:40,889
and you came here
to blow off some steam.

33
00:01:40,891 --> 00:01:44,559
You got me pegged.

34
00:01:44,561 --> 00:01:46,227
I think the bartender
forgot your order.

35
00:01:49,232 --> 00:01:51,066
I have a better idea.

36
00:02:00,043 --> 00:02:04,245
Uh-oh. Looks like
I know your dirty, little secret.

37
00:02:04,247 --> 00:02:05,580
Oh, it's...

38
00:02:05,582 --> 00:02:07,048
Shh.

39
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:10,652
I won't tell
if you won't tell.

40
00:02:10,654 --> 00:02:15,457
All right. You know
my secret. Now...

41
00:02:17,561 --> 00:02:19,561
Tell me one of yours.

42
00:02:21,098 --> 00:02:23,431
Ok.

43
00:02:23,433 --> 00:02:26,901
Only if you promise
not to tell anyone.

44
00:02:26,903 --> 00:02:29,204
Cross my heart
and hope to die.

45
00:02:29,228 --> 00:02:33,228
<b><font color="#00FF00">♪ Arrow 6x04 ♪</font></b>

Original Air Date on November 2, 2014

47
00:02:42,219 --> 00:02:44,919
Well, William did an
excellent job picking out your tie.

48
00:02:44,921 --> 00:02:46,121
Yeah. He was
very excited.

49
00:02:46,123 --> 00:02:48,623
He wanted to come
to dinner.

50
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:50,925
I told him that Raisa
was his date tonight.

51
00:02:50,927 --> 00:02:53,561
Oh. Well, she's
a lucky woman.

52
00:02:53,563 --> 00:02:57,599
Has it, um,
really been 3 years

53
00:02:57,601 --> 00:02:59,567
since the first time
we did this?

54
00:02:59,569 --> 00:03:01,102
Yeah. Let's just hope
that this date goes

55
00:03:01,104 --> 00:03:02,437
better than that one.

56
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:03,772
I think it will.

57
00:03:03,774 --> 00:03:05,573
Don't jinx it.

58
00:03:05,575 --> 00:03:08,109
Masked gunmen could
come through the door,

59
00:03:08,111 --> 00:03:10,211
and it would have been
better than our first dinner.

60
00:03:10,213 --> 00:03:13,281
Only because we were
not being blown up.

61
00:03:13,283 --> 00:03:16,251
Well, you know, also
because I wasn't ready,

62
00:03:16,253 --> 00:03:19,487
not the way I am now.

63
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:21,289
Well, now the time
is right.

64
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:22,424
Yeah.

65
00:03:22,426 --> 00:03:23,591
Mr. Mayor.

66
00:03:23,593 --> 00:03:25,960
- Yes?
- I--I'm sorry to interrupt.

67
00:03:25,962 --> 00:03:28,730
I just wanted to say
that I'm voting

68
00:03:28,732 --> 00:03:31,966
against that awful
anti-vigilante referendum.

69
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,768
Oh, that's
very nice to hear.

70
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,704
Are you two
back together?

71
00:03:37,274 --> 00:03:39,140
Such a sweet couple.

72
00:03:39,142 --> 00:03:41,976
Uh, well, enjoy
your dinner.

73
00:03:41,978 --> 00:03:44,879
Thank you. Don't forget
to vote, ok?

74
00:03:48,185 --> 00:03:50,185
You pay her
to say that?

75
00:03:50,187 --> 00:03:53,221
I had absolutely nothing
to do with that.

76
00:03:53,223 --> 00:03:56,324
Hmm. Well, I am the mayor's
girlfriend now,

77
00:03:56,326 --> 00:03:59,994
so does that get me
a break on my taxes

78
00:03:59,996 --> 00:04:02,664
or maybe a pass
on jury duty?

79
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:05,066
I mean, I--I was gonna
offer to bring you

80
00:04:05,068 --> 00:04:07,068
to a fundraiser.

81
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,203
Ehn.

82
00:04:08,205 --> 00:04:09,838
I can not tell you
what it is

83
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,006
if you're gonna keep
making that face.

84
00:04:12,008 --> 00:04:15,810
No. Sorry.
It's just, you know...

85
00:04:15,812 --> 00:04:16,945
With Overwatch

86
00:04:16,947 --> 00:04:18,813
and the startup
with Curtis

87
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:24,853
and, you know, our old
but new relationship,

88
00:04:24,855 --> 00:04:26,654
maybe we could...

89
00:04:28,058 --> 00:04:30,692
Ease into
some of the things.

90
00:04:30,694 --> 00:04:32,794
Of course, of course.

91
00:04:32,796 --> 00:04:35,196
I love rolling
to those things solo.

92
00:04:35,198 --> 00:04:37,398
Yeah, you're lying.

93
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,368
I'm kidding.
I'm--I'm really happy

94
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:42,871
that you're busy,
and I'm especially excited

95
00:04:42,873 --> 00:04:44,506
for--for this thing
with Curtis

96
00:04:44,508 --> 00:04:46,875
because it--
truth be told,

97
00:04:46,877 --> 00:04:48,176
it is important that
you have something

98
00:04:48,178 --> 00:04:50,178
in your life that is not
just the--

99
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,513
The team.

100
00:04:51,515 --> 00:04:53,414
Yes.

101
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:55,216
No. I mean...

102
00:04:55,218 --> 00:04:57,385
The team.

103
00:04:57,387 --> 00:04:59,087
This is how it felt
to be you, isn't it?

104
00:04:59,089 --> 00:05:01,723
Oh, yeah.

105
00:05:01,725 --> 00:05:03,258
I'm sorry.

106
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,692
Go.

107
00:05:12,068 --> 00:05:13,568
What's going on?

108
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:15,403
Body dropped outside
of a bar.

109
00:05:15,405 --> 00:05:18,439
Dinah's on the scene
with SCPD.

110
00:05:18,441 --> 00:05:21,009
The Vic was
dead on arrival.

111
00:05:23,914 --> 00:05:25,613
Paramedics are calling it
internal hemorrhaging,

112
00:05:25,615 --> 00:05:28,082
but I'd recognize this kill
from a mile away.

113
00:05:28,084 --> 00:05:30,518
Sonic scream did this
an inch from his ear.

114
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,887
- Ouch.
- Laurel.

115
00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:35,190
Witnesses saw the Vic
leaving with a woman, a brunette.

116
00:05:35,192 --> 00:05:36,925
Maybe Laurel got
a wig.

117
00:05:36,927 --> 00:05:38,593
According to witnesses,
they were very handsy

118
00:05:38,595 --> 00:05:40,328
with each other
on the way out.

119
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:41,963
What do you guys think?

120
00:05:41,965 --> 00:05:43,865
Black Siren turned
black widow?

121
00:05:43,867 --> 00:05:45,834
You know, because she
mates and then kills.

122
00:05:45,836 --> 00:05:47,535
Mm-hmm.

123
00:05:47,537 --> 00:05:49,671
Dinah, thanks.
We'll take it from here.

124
00:05:51,308 --> 00:05:53,708
Victim was an accountant
named Jackson Klimavich.

125
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:56,311
No criminal record,
boring job,

126
00:05:56,313 --> 00:05:57,979
really boring
Upswipz profile.

127
00:05:57,981 --> 00:06:00,982
Well, he was married,
so maybe not so boring.

128
00:06:00,984 --> 00:06:02,851
Boring and scummy.

129
00:06:02,853 --> 00:06:05,086
Sorry. Had to help Lance
finish up the polling analysis.

130
00:06:05,088 --> 00:06:07,322
Star City stands
at 70% against

131
00:06:07,324 --> 00:06:09,724
the anti-vigilante
legislation.

132
00:06:09,726 --> 00:06:11,893
That's 70%
for us, accounting

133
00:06:11,895 --> 00:06:13,728
for the double negative
you just used.

134
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:15,730
Yeah, but after everything this team
has done for the city--

135
00:06:15,732 --> 00:06:17,365
- You'd think it'd be higher.
- Yeah.

136
00:06:17,367 --> 00:06:18,566
What'd I miss?

137
00:06:18,568 --> 00:06:20,168
Evil Laurel seduced
a guy

138
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:21,369
and then killed him.

139
00:06:21,371 --> 00:06:22,770
Why?

140
00:06:22,772 --> 00:06:23,938
That's what we
have to figure out,

141
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,340
but first,
we have to find her.

142
00:06:25,342 --> 00:06:26,975
Laurel's been in the wind
way too long.

143
00:06:26,977 --> 00:06:28,309
We're on it.

144
00:06:28,311 --> 00:06:29,644
Speaking of being on it,
did you mail out

145
00:06:29,646 --> 00:06:31,813
our articles
of incorporation? Heh.

146
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,350
For our startup.
The documents required

147
00:06:35,352 --> 00:06:37,151
to, you know,
start it up.

148
00:06:37,153 --> 00:06:38,753
Oh, my God. They are
in a Manila envelope

149
00:06:38,755 --> 00:06:40,755
on my countertop
with every intention of mailing them.

150
00:06:40,757 --> 00:06:43,291
I was just telling Oliver how
I'm being stretched too thin.

151
00:06:43,293 --> 00:06:44,826
Wait a minute.
What do you mean by just?

152
00:06:44,828 --> 00:06:46,828
We were at dinner, and
then I got your text.

153
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,963
- Felicity.
- No. It's the job. It's ok.

154
00:06:48,965 --> 00:06:50,265
No, no, no.
This is all on me.

155
00:06:50,267 --> 00:06:52,166
I 911ed you over
one dead body.

156
00:06:52,168 --> 00:06:53,601
Can you still make it
out to dessert?

157
00:06:53,603 --> 00:06:55,803
Well, no. We have to
find evil Laurel.

158
00:06:55,805 --> 00:06:57,171
No, no, no. I will find
evil Laurel.

159
00:06:57,173 --> 00:06:58,640
You go out there
and take your ass back

160
00:06:58,642 --> 00:06:59,807
and get your man.

161
00:06:59,809 --> 00:07:01,175
- Are you sure?
- Are you kidding me?

162
00:07:01,177 --> 00:07:02,577
I was, like, you guys'
bigger shipper.

163
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:03,811
I feel like the reconciliation
taking effect

164
00:07:03,813 --> 00:07:05,380
is, like, kind of
on me.

165
00:07:05,382 --> 00:07:07,315
- You're amazing.
- All right. I'm terrific.

166
00:07:07,317 --> 00:07:08,650
- Well...
- Is that getting old?

167
00:07:08,652 --> 00:07:10,385
- I kind of like it.
- You like?

168
00:07:10,387 --> 00:07:12,627
- Yeah. Oh, I need this.
- Still cool. All right. Go, go.

169
00:07:26,136 --> 00:07:30,071
Finally. I thought you were gonna
keep me waiting here all night.

170
00:07:30,073 --> 00:07:33,641
Patience is how wars
are won, miss Lance.

171
00:07:33,643 --> 00:07:35,777
Well, first battle's
already over.

172
00:07:35,779 --> 00:07:37,712
Hmm.

173
00:07:37,714 --> 00:07:39,213
Look. I don't know

174
00:07:39,215 --> 00:07:41,182
if this is your first
clandestine meeting,

175
00:07:41,184 --> 00:07:44,519
but at this point,
most people would say "thank you."

176
00:07:44,521 --> 00:07:46,888
For foe item
or for leaving a body

177
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:48,423
for the police to find?

178
00:07:48,425 --> 00:07:50,758
Better than a witness
to question.

179
00:07:59,803 --> 00:08:01,636
Any reservations,

180
00:08:01,638 --> 00:08:04,072
concerns about what
comes next?

181
00:08:04,074 --> 00:08:06,574
Of course not.

182
00:08:06,576 --> 00:08:09,077
This one shouldn't
be a problem.

183
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:11,079
Glad to hear it.

184
00:08:11,081 --> 00:08:13,081
Till we meet again.

185
00:08:20,457 --> 00:08:22,457
I'm so sorry that I had to
bail on dinner,

186
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:26,127
but I'm--I'm home now
if you want to, uh, come by

187
00:08:26,129 --> 00:08:28,930
for some dessert.

188
00:08:28,932 --> 00:08:32,934
Yes. Yes. That was
intentionally suggestive.

189
00:08:32,936 --> 00:08:35,103
Ok. Uh, well, good.
I'll see you soon.

190
00:08:41,711 --> 00:08:44,278
Nice try,
but I wasn't born--

191
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,613
- Alena.
- You always announce

192
00:08:45,615 --> 00:08:47,248
your attacks
like that?

193
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,916
What are you doing
in my apartment?!

194
00:08:48,918 --> 00:08:50,551
You think a computer
hacker would know better

195
00:08:50,553 --> 00:08:52,720
than to install
a smart-lock on her door.

196
00:08:52,722 --> 00:08:55,089
I mean, what are you
doing...here?

197
00:08:55,091 --> 00:08:56,624
I need your help.

198
00:08:56,626 --> 00:08:59,160
You you
or--or Helix you?

199
00:08:59,162 --> 00:09:00,928
- Does it matter?
- Let's pretend for a second

200
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,697
that it does.

201
00:09:03,967 --> 00:09:05,700
Who gave you that?

202
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:09,670
Cayden James.

203
00:09:09,672 --> 00:09:11,939
He's working
on something terrible,

204
00:09:11,941 --> 00:09:15,443
something that will hurt
the entire world,

205
00:09:15,445 --> 00:09:18,946
and I need your help
to stop him.

206
00:09:26,195 --> 00:09:27,556
I helped you break
Cayden James out

207
00:09:27,557 --> 00:09:28,506
of Argus custody.

208
00:09:28,507 --> 00:09:30,821
I went against my friends,
I went against my team

209
00:09:30,822 --> 00:09:34,457
because you told me
that Cayden James was a good man.

210
00:09:34,459 --> 00:09:37,260
You did it because Cayden could
help you find Adrian Chase,

211
00:09:37,262 --> 00:09:38,962
and he delivered.

212
00:09:38,964 --> 00:09:40,664
So at what point did he become
a criminal mastermind?

213
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:42,365
I don't know.
At some point

214
00:09:42,367 --> 00:09:44,768
during his 8 months
in Argus custody.

215
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:48,371
They held him in a glorified
shipping container, Felicity.

216
00:09:48,373 --> 00:09:50,907
Nutrition withholding,
sensory deprivation.

217
00:09:50,909 --> 00:09:52,642
They broke him.

218
00:09:52,644 --> 00:09:54,010
Well, in that case,
he should be

219
00:09:54,012 --> 00:09:55,512
in a funny farm
somewhere.

220
00:09:55,514 --> 00:09:57,013
He shouldn't be planning
the end of the world.

221
00:09:57,015 --> 00:09:58,548
Actually, how do I know
that you being here

222
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:59,916
isn't part of his plan?

223
00:09:59,918 --> 00:10:01,584
Because I could never
go along with what

224
00:10:01,586 --> 00:10:03,253
I suspect he's planning,
Felicity.

225
00:10:03,255 --> 00:10:06,823
I am a hacktivist,
not a monster.

226
00:10:06,825 --> 00:10:12,829
You say he has plans
to hurt the world? How?

227
00:10:12,831 --> 00:10:14,564
I don't know exactly
what he is planning,

228
00:10:14,566 --> 00:10:16,800
but I saw
a casualty estimate,

229
00:10:16,802 --> 00:10:19,636
and the most conservative
estimate is 4% collateral damage.

230
00:10:19,638 --> 00:10:22,305
4% of what?

231
00:10:22,307 --> 00:10:24,841
The world population.

232
00:10:24,843 --> 00:10:28,244
That's almost
300 million people.

233
00:10:28,246 --> 00:10:29,979
If we try and hack
his servers,

234
00:10:29,981 --> 00:10:32,382
we might be able to
figure out what he's planning.

235
00:10:32,384 --> 00:10:33,616
Ok. Where is he now?

236
00:10:33,618 --> 00:10:36,453
Corto Maltese,
but I came here because...

237
00:10:36,455 --> 00:10:38,822
I didn't know who else
to reach out to.

238
00:10:41,393 --> 00:10:43,259
Will you help me?

239
00:10:45,731 --> 00:10:47,397
We set Cayden James
loose, Alena.

240
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:49,099
Of course
I'm helping.

241
00:10:56,174 --> 00:10:58,174
Looks like the same M.O.

242
00:10:58,176 --> 00:11:02,345
Did Laurel also
make out with this one first?

243
00:11:02,347 --> 00:11:04,681
It's a legitimate
investigatory question.

244
00:11:04,683 --> 00:11:06,249
Cause of death was the same.

245
00:11:06,251 --> 00:11:07,650
This was
definitely Laurel.

246
00:11:07,652 --> 00:11:09,419
Yeah. Victimology
was similar, too,

247
00:11:09,421 --> 00:11:11,354
insofar that this woman
is just as boring as the first guy.

248
00:11:11,356 --> 00:11:13,356
College librarian
may even be more boring.

249
00:11:13,358 --> 00:11:14,691
Maybe Laurel's
killing for sport.

250
00:11:14,693 --> 00:11:16,426
Doesn't sound like her.

251
00:11:16,428 --> 00:11:19,095
Black Siren's not the Laurel you
remember, remember?

252
00:11:19,097 --> 00:11:20,296
Any word on
tracking her down?

253
00:11:20,298 --> 00:11:22,098
Nothing useable
from the CCTV cams

254
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,733
we found on either
crime scene.

255
00:11:23,735 --> 00:11:25,168
Forensics is
a dead end, as well.

256
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:26,836
- And Felicity?
- I tried texting her,

257
00:11:26,838 --> 00:11:28,404
but she hasn't
hit me back.

258
00:11:28,406 --> 00:11:29,873
Fine. Let's hit
the streets.

259
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,441
Someone has to be
able to help us find Laurel.

260
00:11:31,443 --> 00:11:34,344
What about me?
Um, I want to hit the streets, too,

261
00:11:34,346 --> 00:11:36,212
and maybe a couple
of bad guys.

262
00:11:36,214 --> 00:11:38,281
Curtis, with Felicity AWOL,
we need tech.

263
00:11:38,283 --> 00:11:40,250
Keep working
that angle.

264
00:11:40,252 --> 00:11:44,287
I--I've been working
that angle.

265
00:11:48,026 --> 00:11:49,125
Another dead end.

266
00:11:49,127 --> 00:11:50,527
Did you try spoofing
the subarray?

267
00:11:50,529 --> 00:11:51,961
- Yeah.
- Ok. What about the--

268
00:11:51,963 --> 00:11:53,530
Yeah, but these
firewalls are crafted.

269
00:11:53,532 --> 00:11:55,298
I mean, the protection
protocols are just...

270
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,699
- Art.
- Well, I was gonna say

271
00:11:56,701 --> 00:11:58,902
impenetrable,
but yeah, that, too.

272
00:11:58,904 --> 00:12:02,305
Cayden'd be the only one
who could get onto Cayden's system.

273
00:12:02,307 --> 00:12:05,074
Oh, my God.
You're a genius.

274
00:12:05,076 --> 00:12:06,910
You're a genius.

275
00:12:06,912 --> 00:12:09,145
We need to convince
Cayden's system that we're him.

276
00:12:09,147 --> 00:12:11,581
That's like saying
all we need is a trillion dollars.

277
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:13,316
No, no, no. We have to work
off Cayden's system.

278
00:12:13,318 --> 00:12:15,018
I told you he's
in Corto Maltese.

279
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,319
Yeah, but Helix
is right here.

280
00:12:16,321 --> 00:12:17,720
We cleared the place
out, Felicity.

281
00:12:17,722 --> 00:12:18,855
- It's sanitized.
- But what about the wiring,

282
00:12:18,857 --> 00:12:20,523
the digital
infrastructure?

283
00:12:20,525 --> 00:12:22,058
That's proprietary,
Cayden's own design.

284
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,326
We left that in place.

285
00:12:23,328 --> 00:12:25,662
That'll work.
Let's get the gear.

286
00:12:25,664 --> 00:12:27,497
Does that include
a ghost drive

287
00:12:27,499 --> 00:12:29,098
because we're gonna need that to get
into Cayden's system.

288
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,767
I know a guy.

289
00:12:30,769 --> 00:12:32,902
Whoa! What's all this?

290
00:12:32,904 --> 00:12:34,337
Oh, just some stuff
for a startup

291
00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:35,371
that Curtis and I are
trying to start up.

292
00:12:35,373 --> 00:12:36,372
Oh, good for you.

293
00:12:36,374 --> 00:12:38,041
You guys are funded?

294
00:12:38,043 --> 00:12:39,642
Well, seed money
from our reputation

295
00:12:39,644 --> 00:12:41,344
of being geniuses at Palmer Tech,
though I'd feel

296
00:12:41,346 --> 00:12:43,179
more like a genius
if I knew what we were starting up.

297
00:12:43,181 --> 00:12:44,981
We're thinking something
in the smarthome area.

298
00:12:44,983 --> 00:12:47,217
- You're joking.
- No.

299
00:12:47,219 --> 00:12:48,418
You left Helix--

300
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,453
I was kicked out
of Helix by you.

301
00:12:50,455 --> 00:12:51,754
To make home appliances?

302
00:12:51,756 --> 00:12:53,189
I thought you wanted
to change the world.

303
00:12:53,191 --> 00:12:54,757
I thought you wanted
to change the world,

304
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:55,992
and look where you
ended up.

305
00:12:55,994 --> 00:12:57,594
Sorry. That's--
I didn't--

306
00:12:57,596 --> 00:12:59,362
No. We should go.

307
00:12:59,364 --> 00:13:01,698
We should go.

308
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,533
Ok. We good?

309
00:13:03,535 --> 00:13:04,968
Mm-hmm.

310
00:13:06,204 --> 00:13:08,671
Oliver!

311
00:13:08,673 --> 00:13:10,640
Hi. What are you
doing here?

312
00:13:10,642 --> 00:13:13,042
You invited me.

313
00:13:13,044 --> 00:13:14,210
That's right.

314
00:13:14,212 --> 00:13:16,412
What is she
doing here?

315
00:13:16,414 --> 00:13:18,781
Hi. Heh.

316
00:13:18,783 --> 00:13:21,384
I'm just gonna
go over there.

317
00:13:21,386 --> 00:13:23,453
Ok. Come in.

318
00:13:23,455 --> 00:13:26,289
I know how much you love
to say, "I told you so"--

319
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:28,157
- No, that's you.
- So consider this

320
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:29,392
an early Christmas gift.

321
00:13:29,394 --> 00:13:30,860
Cayden James is
a bad person,

322
00:13:30,862 --> 00:13:32,595
and he's planning on
doing a bad thing.

323
00:13:32,597 --> 00:13:35,565
Are you sure that
you can trust her?

324
00:13:35,567 --> 00:13:37,634
I wouldn't exactly
use the word "trust."

325
00:13:37,636 --> 00:13:39,936
Then wherever you're
going, I'm going, too.

326
00:13:39,938 --> 00:13:42,238
No. This isn't your life
anymore. No.

327
00:13:44,376 --> 00:13:47,577
At least tell the team
what you're doing.

328
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:50,346
I will tell them.
I will call them on my way,

329
00:13:50,348 --> 00:13:53,549
and then when I am done,
we can finish dinner, starting with dessert.

330
00:13:53,551 --> 00:13:54,951
Alena!

331
00:13:58,556 --> 00:14:00,156
Didn't you know you guys
were back together.

332
00:14:00,158 --> 00:14:01,691
Sure are.

333
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,374
Excuse me.

334
00:14:18,376 --> 00:14:19,642
Ohh!

335
00:14:21,479 --> 00:14:25,281
Here you go.

336
00:14:25,283 --> 00:14:26,683
I'm such a klutz.

337
00:14:26,685 --> 00:14:29,018
Don't worry. Me, too.

338
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,487
I love your shoes.
They're so cute.

339
00:14:31,489 --> 00:14:33,356
Custom-designed.

340
00:14:33,358 --> 00:14:36,793
Girls can rock limited edition
kicks, too, right?

341
00:14:36,795 --> 00:14:39,729
Absolutely.
I'm Dinah, by the way.

342
00:14:39,731 --> 00:14:41,397
Jenny.

343
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:43,366
It's really nice
to meet you.

344
00:14:46,338 --> 00:14:48,471
I don't know why
I didn't think of this sooner.

345
00:14:48,473 --> 00:14:50,373
Laurel's cry resonates
in the terahertz range,

346
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:53,876
which can be triangulated
according to geography.

347
00:14:53,878 --> 00:14:55,712
Was I supposed to
understand a single word of that,

348
00:14:55,714 --> 00:14:57,914
or are you talking
to yourself?

349
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:01,150
Sorry. Short version is
I think I figured out a way

350
00:15:01,152 --> 00:15:04,153
to find evil Laurel
by tracking her Sonic cry.

351
00:15:04,155 --> 00:15:06,522
Meaning if we she uses
it we can find her.

352
00:15:06,524 --> 00:15:08,057
Yeah, only problem
being it means someone's

353
00:15:08,059 --> 00:15:09,959
probably in trouble--whoa!

354
00:15:12,263 --> 00:15:13,730
Talk about timing.

355
00:15:13,732 --> 00:15:14,931
Yeah. So that means
she just used it, right?

356
00:15:14,933 --> 00:15:17,400
- Mm-hmm.
- Where?

357
00:15:17,402 --> 00:15:19,836
A parking garage
between Marleau and Hainesly.

358
00:15:19,838 --> 00:15:21,537
- I'll tell John and Rene.
- Mm-hmm.

359
00:15:26,945 --> 00:15:28,244
Nothing on level C.

360
00:15:28,246 --> 00:15:29,712
D is clear.

361
00:15:29,714 --> 00:15:31,714
A is empty,
except for a sweet-ass Corvette

362
00:15:31,716 --> 00:15:32,882
someone left overnight.

363
00:15:32,884 --> 00:15:34,217
Guys...

364
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,556
We're too late.

365
00:15:40,558 --> 00:15:42,058
Actually,
you're right on time.

366
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:49,532
My mistake for dawdling,
I guess.

367
00:15:49,534 --> 00:15:53,669
It's just--it's just
she's so, so pretty.

368
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,240
I really wanted to
hold her hand

369
00:15:57,242 --> 00:15:59,075
until the end came.

370
00:15:59,077 --> 00:16:01,144
You are one
twisted bitch.

371
00:16:01,146 --> 00:16:03,946
That really
hurts my feelings.

372
00:16:03,948 --> 00:16:05,581
Unh.

373
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:15,825
- She's gone.
- Good work tracking her down.

374
00:16:15,827 --> 00:16:17,360
Don't give me points
for being late.

375
00:16:17,362 --> 00:16:19,028
Call it in.

376
00:16:38,216 --> 00:16:41,284
Ok. You couldn't have
told me to change?

377
00:16:41,286 --> 00:16:43,252
Well,
you look great.

378
00:16:43,254 --> 00:16:46,222
We here for a GMD or
an acid trip-techno freak show?

379
00:16:46,224 --> 00:16:47,824
Both if you want.

380
00:16:47,826 --> 00:16:50,159
Ok. So the dealer's
name is Amnesiac,

381
00:16:50,161 --> 00:16:52,695
but I have no idea
how to find him.

382
00:16:52,697 --> 00:16:54,297
Well...

383
00:16:54,299 --> 00:16:56,399
Whoa! Ok. Rude.

384
00:16:56,401 --> 00:16:59,702
Maybe that door guarded by the 3
scary dudes with chains for brains.

385
00:17:01,906 --> 00:17:03,673
They look friendly.

386
00:17:11,816 --> 00:17:13,483
Hello.

387
00:17:13,485 --> 00:17:17,787
- You lost?
- No. We're here to see...

388
00:17:17,789 --> 00:17:20,156
- Amnesiac.
- Mm-hmm. Yep.

389
00:17:23,161 --> 00:17:24,494
Now.

390
00:17:26,764 --> 00:17:28,231
Ok! That turned!

391
00:17:28,233 --> 00:17:29,499
I don't think we
should go in here.

392
00:17:29,501 --> 00:17:32,668
Hands off!
Easy, chrome dome!

393
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:35,972
Forgive
my thuggish compatriots.

394
00:17:35,974 --> 00:17:39,175
I pay them to uphold
a certain aesthetic.

395
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,079
You're Amnesiac?

396
00:17:43,081 --> 00:17:45,014
Your shock is exactly
what this establishment

397
00:17:45,016 --> 00:17:47,216
aims to cultivate.

398
00:17:47,218 --> 00:17:51,020
Now what brings you here?

399
00:17:51,022 --> 00:17:52,989
We need a ghost
mirror drive.

400
00:17:52,991 --> 00:17:55,158
- What for?
- That's our business.

401
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,759
And selling
illegal tech is mine,

402
00:17:56,761 --> 00:17:58,928
and I only get to stay
in business by avoiding

403
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:01,030
legal entanglements.

404
00:18:01,032 --> 00:18:03,799
Everything about you two
screams narc.

405
00:18:03,801 --> 00:18:04,800
Well...

406
00:18:24,455 --> 00:18:26,389
No, no, no!
Don't shoot. It's me!

407
00:18:26,391 --> 00:18:28,457
Oliver?

408
00:18:28,459 --> 00:18:29,926
Are you ok?

409
00:18:29,928 --> 00:18:32,295
No! What the hell
are you doing here?

410
00:18:32,297 --> 00:18:33,596
Trying to keep you safe.

411
00:18:33,598 --> 00:18:35,598
I saw the guys take you!

412
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,333
Yeah. Those guys
were taking me to this guy,

413
00:18:37,335 --> 00:18:39,168
who was gonna give us
what we needed to stop Cayden James,

414
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:43,606
but now they won't because you kicked
the crap out of them.

415
00:18:43,608 --> 00:18:45,074
God.

416
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:48,144
You screwed up
everything.

417
00:18:55,037 --> 00:18:56,670
He said he thought
you were police.

418
00:18:56,672 --> 00:18:58,782
You know, me not
wanting your help tonight

419
00:18:58,783 --> 00:19:01,088
doesn't have to do with me
just needing to do this alone.

420
00:19:01,188 --> 00:19:02,888
It has to do with me
wanting to protect you.

421
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:05,391
I was trying to
protect you.

422
00:19:05,393 --> 00:19:06,691
You are under
24/7 surveillance

423
00:19:06,692 --> 00:19:07,791
from the FBI right now.

424
00:19:07,793 --> 00:19:09,026
What if somebody
saw you?

425
00:19:09,028 --> 00:19:10,427
I can handle it!

426
00:19:10,429 --> 00:19:11,962
What I cannot handle
and will not stand for

427
00:19:11,964 --> 00:19:13,964
is you going off
after a criminal without backup.

428
00:19:13,966 --> 00:19:17,835
I get that,
but I don't need that right now.

429
00:19:17,837 --> 00:19:19,403
What I need...

430
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,073
What I need is
a ghost mirror drive,

431
00:19:23,075 --> 00:19:25,709
and I need to get Alena out of here
before they all come to.

432
00:19:25,711 --> 00:19:28,312
- Felicity.
- We will talk about this later.

433
00:19:32,018 --> 00:19:33,851
Another boring
person.

434
00:19:33,853 --> 00:19:35,686
Disrespect
the dead much?

435
00:19:35,688 --> 00:19:38,022
He's right. No connections,
no money to speak of,

436
00:19:38,024 --> 00:19:40,491
no apparent benefit
to killing 3 different people at random.

437
00:19:40,493 --> 00:19:42,126
They weren't random.

438
00:19:42,128 --> 00:19:44,361
Autopsies finally came
back on all 3 victims.

439
00:19:44,363 --> 00:19:46,163
Apart from all 3
being thoroughly unremarkable,

440
00:19:46,165 --> 00:19:47,798
they had one other
thing in common.

441
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,034
All 3 had traces
of Dimotex 75 on their hands.

442
00:19:50,036 --> 00:19:51,669
Dimotex is
an adhesive polymer.

443
00:19:51,671 --> 00:19:53,804
It's used on the streets
to rip off fingerprints.

444
00:19:53,806 --> 00:19:56,240
Laurel was stealing
fingerprints.

445
00:19:56,242 --> 00:19:57,808
Why would
somebody want to collect

446
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:59,310
the fingerprints
of 3 nobodies?

447
00:19:59,312 --> 00:20:01,345
And I disrespect
the dead?

448
00:20:02,615 --> 00:20:04,782
They're not nobodies.

449
00:20:06,219 --> 00:20:07,685
They're invisible.
Boring jobs,

450
00:20:07,687 --> 00:20:09,086
no connection
to community.

451
00:20:09,088 --> 00:20:10,354
What makes them remarkable
is just how

452
00:20:10,356 --> 00:20:12,223
unremarkable they are.

453
00:20:12,225 --> 00:20:15,826
What are you saying,
Hoss--I mean, boss?

454
00:20:15,828 --> 00:20:19,430
What if these people's
backgrounds are just a cover?

455
00:20:19,432 --> 00:20:22,800
They're boring
by design to be invisible.

456
00:20:22,802 --> 00:20:24,768
So you're saying they're all
some kind of covert operatives?

457
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:26,770
They could be anything,

458
00:20:26,772 --> 00:20:28,272
but whatever they're
dealing with is big enough

459
00:20:28,274 --> 00:20:29,740
that they needed a cover.

460
00:20:29,742 --> 00:20:31,508
Be nice to know.
Then we could figure out

461
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:33,210
who Laurel's going
after next.

462
00:20:33,212 --> 00:20:35,746
Anybody got
a crystal ball?

463
00:20:35,748 --> 00:20:38,582
I might not be able
to figure out where she's headed,

464
00:20:38,584 --> 00:20:40,584
but I might be able
to figure out where she was.

465
00:20:40,586 --> 00:20:42,820
Now, Sonic cries leave
ripples in the air.

466
00:20:42,822 --> 00:20:45,022
I might be able to
backtrace where Laurel's been

467
00:20:45,024 --> 00:20:46,624
and maybe even find out
a pattern,

468
00:20:46,626 --> 00:20:48,325
maybe even determine where
she's operating out of.

469
00:20:48,327 --> 00:20:50,694
I heard two mights
and two maybes, but I'll take it.

470
00:20:50,696 --> 00:20:53,097
In the meantime,
I'll try to raise Felicity.

471
00:20:53,099 --> 00:20:54,865
If anyone can hack
through these covers

472
00:20:54,867 --> 00:20:57,268
to these people's
real identities, it's her.

473
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,240
Wow. Love what you
haven't done with the place.

474
00:21:03,242 --> 00:21:05,075
The cat-5 hookups are
there and back there.

475
00:21:06,245 --> 00:21:08,812
Yeah. One sec.
Hey, John.

476
00:21:08,814 --> 00:21:10,414
Hey. Did you decide
to take a vacation?

477
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:12,783
Uh, no. Sorry. I just
have a situation here.

478
00:21:12,785 --> 00:21:14,718
Yeah. Well, Curtis
told me about the startup.

479
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,787
No. This isn't
about the company.

480
00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:18,489
This is about Cayden James,
and I don't have time to talk to you about it

481
00:21:18,491 --> 00:21:19,923
right now,
but you were right,

482
00:21:19,925 --> 00:21:21,325
and I was wrong about
breaking him out of Argus.

483
00:21:21,327 --> 00:21:22,926
- Felicity, listen.
- I'm in Helix right now.

484
00:21:22,928 --> 00:21:24,561
I'm just gonna clear up
the situation real quick.

485
00:21:24,563 --> 00:21:26,297
I will be back at the bunker
before you know it, I promise.

486
00:21:26,299 --> 00:21:28,799
All right, but get back here
soon. We need you.

487
00:21:28,801 --> 00:21:31,068
I'm on it.

488
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:34,972
Got it! The mights
and maybes have paid off.

489
00:21:36,242 --> 00:21:38,876
Ok. Backtracing Laurel's
sound waves produced

490
00:21:38,878 --> 00:21:41,845
a probabilistic curve
of geolocations, which I canvassed

491
00:21:41,847 --> 00:21:44,014
by means of cameras
of various sorts.

492
00:21:44,016 --> 00:21:46,350
Curtis, less how,
more what.

493
00:21:46,352 --> 00:21:47,918
I found
a probable location

494
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,687
for Laurel's
base of operation.

495
00:21:49,689 --> 00:21:52,156
Tasking
a keyhole satellite.

496
00:21:54,126 --> 00:21:55,693
When was this?

497
00:21:55,695 --> 00:21:58,395
10 seconds ago.

498
00:21:58,397 --> 00:22:00,130
Anybody know that guy?

499
00:22:02,902 --> 00:22:03,934
How about that one?

500
00:22:03,936 --> 00:22:05,369
Never seen him
before.

501
00:22:05,371 --> 00:22:08,238
I have. We should go.
Felicity's in trouble.

502
00:22:09,575 --> 00:22:12,142
Every file
in here is labeled Arclight.

503
00:22:12,144 --> 00:22:14,445
Must be a code name
for whatever James is planning.

504
00:22:14,447 --> 00:22:17,648
Now the question is,
what is the plan?

505
00:22:27,393 --> 00:22:29,193
You're supposed to
be in Corto Maltese.

506
00:22:29,195 --> 00:22:30,227
This is Cayden James?

507
00:22:30,229 --> 00:22:31,995
No, miss Smoak.

508
00:22:36,435 --> 00:22:38,736
I'm Cayden James.

509
00:22:39,972 --> 00:22:42,673
Very nice to finally
make your acquaintance.

510
00:22:46,967 --> 00:22:48,931
In case you're curious
about why I'm here,

511
00:22:48,932 --> 00:22:51,266
it's not nostalgia.

512
00:22:53,302 --> 00:22:56,831
It's you. We never
finished our conversation

513
00:22:56,832 --> 00:22:59,099
in Corto Maltese,
which is

514
00:22:59,101 --> 00:23:00,934
where you thought I was,

515
00:23:00,936 --> 00:23:05,238
because you've been
pinging my cell.

516
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:08,341
I was hurt, truly.

517
00:23:08,343 --> 00:23:12,279
Not the betrayal
so much as the naivete

518
00:23:12,281 --> 00:23:15,916
of someone I thought
had potential.

519
00:23:15,918 --> 00:23:17,718
I'm sorry, miss Smoak.

520
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,954
I'm afraid you're what's
known as collateral damage.

521
00:23:20,956 --> 00:23:23,056
Horrible waste
of talent.

522
00:23:25,294 --> 00:23:27,461
Make it as humane
as possible.

523
00:23:31,567 --> 00:23:35,602
One shot.
You won't even know.

524
00:23:36,739 --> 00:23:38,672
Get down!
Get down.

525
00:24:28,157 --> 00:24:29,689
How'd you guys
know we needed you--

526
00:24:29,691 --> 00:24:30,891
not that I'm complaining.

527
00:24:30,893 --> 00:24:32,359
Felicity.

528
00:24:35,397 --> 00:24:37,030
Oh! Alena!

529
00:24:37,032 --> 00:24:38,999
Call an ambulance!

530
00:24:39,001 --> 00:24:40,333
Stay with me.
Stay with me.

531
00:24:40,335 --> 00:24:42,269
Stay with me.
Alena.

532
00:24:42,271 --> 00:24:44,538
It's bad.
It's really bad.

533
00:24:46,241 --> 00:24:47,741
Alena!

534
00:24:51,046 --> 00:24:52,879
How is she?

535
00:24:52,881 --> 00:24:54,548
Stabilized.

536
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:57,117
The next couple hours
will tell her story.

537
00:24:57,119 --> 00:24:59,119
Um, I air-gapped
her IC room just in case.

538
00:24:59,121 --> 00:25:00,587
If Cayden
tried to kill her

539
00:25:00,589 --> 00:25:01,988
by hacking her
hospital equipment, he can't.

540
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:03,957
Hey.
You all right?

541
00:25:03,959 --> 00:25:06,359
Am I all right
that I broke

542
00:25:06,361 --> 00:25:07,861
a genius madman
out of prison

543
00:25:07,863 --> 00:25:09,329
who's apparently working

544
00:25:09,331 --> 00:25:11,164
with the psychopath
version of Laurel?

545
00:25:11,166 --> 00:25:12,999
Am I ok that I didn't
see what was right in front of my face

546
00:25:13,001 --> 00:25:14,501
and now Alena
might die?

547
00:25:14,503 --> 00:25:16,403
What the hell
do you think?

548
00:25:17,873 --> 00:25:20,640
Sorry. It's not you
I'm mad at.

549
00:25:20,642 --> 00:25:23,777
I know that,
but right now, we need you.

550
00:25:23,779 --> 00:25:26,446
I know. Curtis.

551
00:25:26,448 --> 00:25:29,316
All set. Did everything just
like you told me.

552
00:25:29,318 --> 00:25:33,019
I softened the beach, so now you can,
you know, do your thing.

553
00:25:33,021 --> 00:25:35,055
Well, I couldn't do that before
because of Cayden.

554
00:25:36,291 --> 00:25:37,257
All right.

555
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,560
I'm in.

556
00:25:40,562 --> 00:25:41,862
Oh, John was right.

557
00:25:41,864 --> 00:25:43,230
They were hiding
their identities

558
00:25:43,232 --> 00:25:44,965
because they are
really important.

559
00:25:44,967 --> 00:25:47,100
John thought they were
some kind of spies or something.

560
00:25:47,102 --> 00:25:49,202
More like something.

561
00:25:49,204 --> 00:25:52,172
All 3 are access managers to the IDND,
International Domain Name Directory.

562
00:25:52,174 --> 00:25:53,840
Let's just pretend
for a second

563
00:25:53,842 --> 00:25:55,575
only you and Felicity
know what that is.

564
00:25:55,577 --> 00:25:57,177
The Internet is run
on domain names.

565
00:25:57,179 --> 00:25:58,879
You start messing
with them,

566
00:25:58,881 --> 00:26:00,747
and you start collapsing
whole parts of the Internet.

567
00:26:00,749 --> 00:26:02,082
So Laurel's stealing
fingerprints?

568
00:26:02,084 --> 00:26:03,250
To gain access, I guess.

569
00:26:03,252 --> 00:26:04,851
But why steal 3 sets
of fingerprints?

570
00:26:04,853 --> 00:26:06,386
Wouldn't one
do the job?

571
00:26:06,388 --> 00:26:07,888
No. The Internet is
divided into sections

572
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:09,089
so not one person can
take it down all at once,

573
00:26:09,091 --> 00:26:11,024
and each manager
controls a section.

574
00:26:11,026 --> 00:26:13,059
And all 3 would be needed
to access the master vault,

575
00:26:13,061 --> 00:26:15,262
which oversees
all sections.

576
00:26:15,264 --> 00:26:16,930
All right. So Cayden James wants to
take down the Internet.

577
00:26:16,932 --> 00:26:18,398
Can he actually do that?

578
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,034
If you destroy
the vault, yes.

579
00:26:21,036 --> 00:26:22,836
And then what,
I can't send an e-mail?

580
00:26:22,838 --> 00:26:24,137
I mean, so what?

581
00:26:24,139 --> 00:26:25,605
No. The Internet controls
everything now--

582
00:26:25,607 --> 00:26:27,607
electricity, water supply,
hospital equipment.

583
00:26:27,609 --> 00:26:29,709
Also planes, trains,
and automobiles.

584
00:26:29,711 --> 00:26:32,078
Alena said that Cayden's
casualty estimate was

585
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,847
300 million people.

586
00:26:33,849 --> 00:26:35,315
Actually, that sounds low.

587
00:26:35,317 --> 00:26:37,317
Yeah. I don't disagree.

588
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:38,885
This is all my fault.

589
00:26:38,887 --> 00:26:40,520
All right.
Let's keep our focus here.

590
00:26:40,522 --> 00:26:42,422
So James and his
people want to hit this vault.

591
00:26:42,424 --> 00:26:44,291
Do we have
a location on it?

592
00:26:44,293 --> 00:26:46,059
The location is
so classified

593
00:26:46,061 --> 00:26:48,261
that they don't even
have a word for how classified it is.

594
00:26:48,263 --> 00:26:49,763
Be that as it may,
I have a hack running

595
00:26:49,765 --> 00:26:51,097
that will give us
the location soon.

596
00:26:51,099 --> 00:26:52,532
Good, which
means you can get home,

597
00:26:52,534 --> 00:26:53,967
take a shower,
clear your head maybe.

598
00:26:53,969 --> 00:26:55,101
I'm fine.

599
00:26:55,103 --> 00:26:57,304
It's not a request,
Felicity.

600
00:27:06,848 --> 00:27:08,782
- Hey.
- Hey.

601
00:27:08,784 --> 00:27:10,617
John told me
what happened.

602
00:27:10,619 --> 00:27:13,320
Hmm. So I'm guessing
this little visit

603
00:27:13,322 --> 00:27:15,956
is his idea
of therapy.

604
00:27:15,958 --> 00:27:18,892
Actually, I'm thinking
that he probably

605
00:27:18,894 --> 00:27:20,994
wanted you to speak
to one of the world's leading experts

606
00:27:20,996 --> 00:27:24,631
in guilt and regret.

607
00:27:24,633 --> 00:27:26,032
Hmm.

608
00:27:27,669 --> 00:27:30,770
What's happening now
is not your fault.

609
00:27:30,772 --> 00:27:32,806
Is that what I sounded
like all these years?

610
00:27:32,808 --> 00:27:35,075
No. You sounded
smarter.

611
00:27:35,077 --> 00:27:36,810
How did you do it?

612
00:27:36,812 --> 00:27:38,979
How did you balance
being the Green Arrow,

613
00:27:38,981 --> 00:27:40,981
the mayor, a boyfriend,
a brother?

614
00:27:40,983 --> 00:27:42,349
How did--

615
00:27:44,653 --> 00:27:47,220
How did you do it
all by yourself?

616
00:27:47,222 --> 00:27:52,058
I--I d--I didn't
do it all by myself.

617
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,860
I had you.

618
00:27:53,862 --> 00:27:55,362
Yeah. Well, I know
you're just saying that

619
00:27:55,364 --> 00:27:58,064
to get boyfriend points,
and it's working.

620
00:27:58,066 --> 00:27:59,799
I'm being serious,
Felicity.

621
00:27:59,801 --> 00:28:02,802
Even if we weren't
together,

622
00:28:02,804 --> 00:28:05,305
you were always
there with me,

623
00:28:05,307 --> 00:28:07,407
always there to talk
me out of stuff,

624
00:28:07,409 --> 00:28:09,709
to help me being
the Green Arrow.

625
00:28:09,711 --> 00:28:13,213
You were literally
in my ear

626
00:28:13,215 --> 00:28:15,715
every second
that I was in the field,

627
00:28:15,717 --> 00:28:17,150
and that's why I
followed you

628
00:28:17,152 --> 00:28:20,020
to the club tonight--
because I--I wanted

629
00:28:20,022 --> 00:28:22,155
the chance to be there
for you

630
00:28:22,157 --> 00:28:25,025
the way that you've
been there for me.

631
00:28:25,027 --> 00:28:29,362
Well, then what
would I say to you

632
00:28:29,364 --> 00:28:31,765
in this situation?

633
00:28:31,767 --> 00:28:37,270
You would tell me
that when I--you--

634
00:28:37,272 --> 00:28:42,409
ahem--freed Cayden James,
"I did it" because

635
00:28:42,411 --> 00:28:45,078
at the moment,
at that time in your heart,

636
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,280
you thought it was right.

637
00:28:47,282 --> 00:28:48,748
Yeah.

638
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:50,383
But you would tell me
not to live in the past.

639
00:28:50,385 --> 00:28:54,120
You would tell me
to make it right in the present.

640
00:28:54,122 --> 00:28:56,389
You would tell me
to trust myself.

641
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,661
Well, I am very smart,
apparently.

642
00:29:01,663 --> 00:29:03,430
So smart.

643
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:11,571
Sorry. This is
becoming a habit.

644
00:29:11,573 --> 00:29:16,443
It is, and I am
incredibly proud.

645
00:29:31,493 --> 00:29:33,993
Please.

646
00:29:33,995 --> 00:29:37,397
I have a wife
and two little girls.

647
00:29:37,399 --> 00:29:42,869
Shh. I know.
I had a family once.

648
00:29:45,173 --> 00:29:46,773
I appreciate your zeal,
miss Lance,

649
00:29:46,775 --> 00:29:50,143
but we just need people
down, not dead.

650
00:29:50,145 --> 00:29:52,679
Do I question
your method?

651
00:29:52,681 --> 00:29:54,814
Oh, a little
gratitude, please.

652
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:57,350
Were it not for me,
you would have either starved

653
00:29:57,352 --> 00:29:59,819
or bled to death
on Lian Yu.

654
00:30:05,694 --> 00:30:10,263
The pre-Socratic philosopher
Thales of Miletus,

655
00:30:10,265 --> 00:30:13,133
known as the father
of science,

656
00:30:13,135 --> 00:30:15,268
believed that
for any event

657
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:17,904
there was a natural cause,
even if we couldn't see it...

658
00:30:19,107 --> 00:30:22,842
And he thought that
with perfect knowledge

659
00:30:22,844 --> 00:30:24,844
man could control
anything...

660
00:30:30,318 --> 00:30:32,152
everything.

661
00:30:44,499 --> 00:30:47,767
You're just full of surprises,
aren't you?

662
00:30:47,769 --> 00:30:49,736
Oh, I'm just beginning.

663
00:30:57,812 --> 00:31:00,280
Welcome
to the inner sanctum.

664
00:31:22,398 --> 00:31:23,731
He's gone.

665
00:31:23,733 --> 00:31:25,966
Biometric hand scanners.

666
00:31:25,968 --> 00:31:28,936
So cool except
for the dead body part.

667
00:31:29,939 --> 00:31:31,505
Stay sharp.

668
00:31:32,675 --> 00:31:34,475
This place
is huge.

669
00:31:34,477 --> 00:31:35,876
Yeah. Well, it has
to be big to hold,

670
00:31:35,878 --> 00:31:37,111
you know,
the whole Internet.

671
00:31:37,113 --> 00:31:38,512
This way.

672
00:31:41,684 --> 00:31:43,517
Cayden's overclocking
the vault CPU.

673
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:45,019
- English, Felicity.
- He put a virus in the system

674
00:31:45,021 --> 00:31:46,520
that's gonna make
the whole thing explode.

675
00:31:46,522 --> 00:31:48,088
That's a bit
too much English.

676
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:50,190
How much time do we have
before the vault goes boom?

677
00:31:50,192 --> 00:31:51,892
6 minutes. I think
I can stop the virus.

678
00:31:51,894 --> 00:31:54,295
I just need-- I just need one--
I just need one minute.

679
00:31:54,297 --> 00:31:55,696
There's no way Cayden James and Laurel
are gonna let you

680
00:31:55,698 --> 00:31:57,131
just stand there
and do that.

681
00:32:00,136 --> 00:32:01,902
You weren't wrong.

682
00:32:06,742 --> 00:32:08,475
Your men have
engaged the targets.

683
00:32:08,477 --> 00:32:10,277
Our men, miss Lance.

684
00:32:10,279 --> 00:32:12,713
This partnership is
a democracy after all.

685
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:19,453
Oh. Miss Smoak just
appeared on the server.

686
00:32:19,455 --> 00:32:22,056
Clever girl.

687
00:32:22,058 --> 00:32:25,726
Her ingenuity
never disappoints.

688
00:32:25,728 --> 00:32:30,264
I'm coding a little
something to occupy her...

689
00:32:31,601 --> 00:32:33,434
While I take my leave.

690
00:32:34,937 --> 00:32:37,304
Do the same
for her friends, would you?

691
00:32:41,777 --> 00:32:43,143
No, no, no, no, no.

692
00:32:43,145 --> 00:32:45,145
"No" is not what we
want to hear right now.

693
00:32:45,147 --> 00:32:46,780
Cayden just used the processor's
firewall to block me out.

694
00:32:46,782 --> 00:32:49,116
I can't take down
the virus remotely now.

695
00:32:49,118 --> 00:32:50,751
I'm gonna have to do it on site before
he turns this whole place into an ashtray,

696
00:32:50,753 --> 00:32:52,152
not to mention, you know,
the Internet.

697
00:32:52,154 --> 00:32:53,754
- Where's the processor?
- Northwest quadrant.

698
00:32:53,756 --> 00:32:56,156
Fine. We'll cover
you. Delta formation.

699
00:33:06,636 --> 00:33:08,369
Fall back!

700
00:33:09,939 --> 00:33:12,306
We're
outgunned here.

701
00:33:12,308 --> 00:33:13,941
We've got you covered.
Can you handle this?

702
00:33:13,943 --> 00:33:15,709
I can handle it. Just keep
them off me for 4 minutes.

703
00:33:15,711 --> 00:33:17,611
Go, go, go, go, go!

704
00:33:27,423 --> 00:33:29,523
Maybe doing this solo
wasn't such a good idea.

705
00:33:29,525 --> 00:33:31,158
Good thing you're
not alone.

706
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,993
- Oliver?
- Well, technically,

707
00:33:32,995 --> 00:33:34,795
if I'm in this chair,
that makes me Overwatch.

708
00:33:34,797 --> 00:33:36,797
- You're in the bunker?
- I am. You ok with that?

709
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:38,265
I am all right with that.
I am so all right with that.

710
00:33:38,267 --> 00:33:39,700
I'm epically
all right with that,

711
00:33:39,702 --> 00:33:41,201
especially if you have
eyes on this complex.

712
00:33:41,203 --> 00:33:43,604
I think I do.
You've automated the system

713
00:33:43,606 --> 00:33:45,205
to the point that William could
basically operate it.

714
00:33:45,207 --> 00:33:48,008
Do you see the room
in the far northwest quadrant?

715
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:50,878
I do, but I also see
10 hostiles between you and it,

716
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,880
so let me put you
on the safest path.

717
00:33:54,817 --> 00:33:58,886
Take the corridor
to your left.

718
00:33:58,888 --> 00:34:00,988
Are you sure
about that?

719
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:03,824
Sorry. Right. Right.
My left. Your right.

720
00:34:03,826 --> 00:34:05,693
There's a little
bit of a learning curve here.

721
00:34:07,363 --> 00:34:09,563
Overwatch, sitrep.

722
00:34:09,565 --> 00:34:11,031
Overwatch, what's
your situation?

723
00:34:11,033 --> 00:34:13,333
She's fine.

724
00:34:13,335 --> 00:34:14,668
Stop.

725
00:34:16,505 --> 00:34:18,539
Go right.

726
00:34:18,541 --> 00:34:20,007
Under the door.

727
00:34:20,009 --> 00:34:22,543
3, 2, 1.

728
00:34:23,846 --> 00:34:25,279
Coast is clear.

729
00:34:25,281 --> 00:34:26,747
Good.

730
00:34:29,285 --> 00:34:31,051
I'm in.

731
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:36,223
Cayden's not here.

732
00:34:36,225 --> 00:34:38,559
Time to get to work.

733
00:34:46,068 --> 00:34:48,068
Company,
nine o'clock.

734
00:34:52,908 --> 00:34:55,509
I knew you would be
around here somewhere.

735
00:34:55,511 --> 00:34:57,377
Well, I couldn't
stay away from you

736
00:34:57,379 --> 00:34:59,713
except for you've
changed something about yourself.

737
00:34:59,715 --> 00:35:02,382
I just can't quite put
my finger on it.

738
00:35:02,384 --> 00:35:04,485
Here. Let me
help you with that.

739
00:35:15,531 --> 00:35:19,433
So it's a crossbow.
That's cute.

740
00:35:19,435 --> 00:35:21,168
Two more hostiles inbound.

741
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:22,636
Ohh!

742
00:35:25,107 --> 00:35:27,107
Oh! Thank you for that!

743
00:35:27,109 --> 00:35:28,308
Just wanted to give you
a little time.

744
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:29,777
Yeah. Well, I'm gonna
need it.

745
00:35:29,779 --> 00:35:31,311
I have to break
through the processor's

746
00:35:31,313 --> 00:35:33,046
protective firewall to stop
Cayden's virus,

747
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:35,616
and the fact that the processor
is exponentially overclocking

748
00:35:35,618 --> 00:35:37,584
and he's disabled
the cooling system.

749
00:35:37,586 --> 00:35:41,588
Did not understand
a single word that you just said.

750
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:43,423
Oh, well, you understand
blaring noises

751
00:35:43,425 --> 00:35:45,359
and really scary
lights, right?

752
00:35:45,361 --> 00:35:47,694
I know this.

753
00:35:47,696 --> 00:35:50,297
You can do it.

754
00:35:50,299 --> 00:35:51,799
I believe in you.

755
00:36:00,009 --> 00:36:01,208
Time to go.

756
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:10,350
- Thanks.
- No problem.

757
00:36:11,854 --> 00:36:13,153
If this place is
gonna go boom,

758
00:36:13,155 --> 00:36:14,354
let's not be here
when it does.

759
00:36:14,356 --> 00:36:16,056
Overwatch, how we
doing?

760
00:36:16,058 --> 00:36:18,392
Overwatch?

761
00:36:22,531 --> 00:36:24,398
Good job.

762
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,300
And we're not dead.

763
00:36:26,302 --> 00:36:27,801
Told you.

764
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:34,474
You know, if this whole
role reversal thing sticks around,

765
00:36:34,476 --> 00:36:35,976
you're really gonna have to
adopt my saying

766
00:36:35,978 --> 00:36:37,945
of not saying
"I told you so."

767
00:36:37,947 --> 00:36:40,180
You tell me
you told me so.

768
00:36:40,182 --> 00:36:43,450
Yeah, but not
all the time. Heh.

769
00:36:43,452 --> 00:36:45,018
Thank you.

770
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:47,888
Well, I'm just glad
I found a way to help.

771
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:50,691
Heh. You always do.

772
00:36:54,465 --> 00:36:56,726
Thank God we saved
the Internet.

773
00:36:57,641 --> 00:37:01,176
My fantasy football team
was killing it this year.

774
00:37:01,178 --> 00:37:03,645
So this new
partnership--

775
00:37:03,647 --> 00:37:05,147
is it permanent?

776
00:37:05,149 --> 00:37:06,448
Certainly hope not.

777
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:07,850
I think mayor Queen's
probably too busy

778
00:37:07,852 --> 00:37:09,318
to be moonlighting
as tech support.

779
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,954
Besides, after all
those years in the field,

780
00:37:11,956 --> 00:37:14,289
it'd be a shame if you
went down for carpal tunnel.

781
00:37:15,526 --> 00:37:18,293
All kidding aside--
ahem--

782
00:37:18,295 --> 00:37:19,895
we need to focus
on why Laurel has aligned

783
00:37:19,897 --> 00:37:21,663
herself with Cayden James.

784
00:37:21,665 --> 00:37:23,098
Those operatives,
they were the same ones

785
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,867
that we took out
last month.

786
00:37:27,171 --> 00:37:31,707
Sorry. Old habits.

787
00:37:31,709 --> 00:37:33,575
I will leave you to it.

788
00:37:33,577 --> 00:37:34,943
I'll come with you.

789
00:37:34,945 --> 00:37:36,845
Gonna go tell Alena
the good news.

790
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:42,885
Thank you.

791
00:37:42,887 --> 00:37:44,353
No, no. No need
to thank me.

792
00:37:44,355 --> 00:37:46,321
Saving the world is
kind of what we do,

793
00:37:46,323 --> 00:37:48,624
that and fixing
our mistakes.

794
00:37:48,626 --> 00:37:50,893
None of this is
on you, Felicity.

795
00:37:50,895 --> 00:37:52,461
I vouched for Cayden.

796
00:37:52,463 --> 00:37:53,996
You were just
backing my play.

797
00:37:53,998 --> 00:37:56,932
Yeah. Well, like you
said, he changed.

798
00:37:56,934 --> 00:37:58,400
Yeah.

799
00:37:58,402 --> 00:38:00,335
Now that you're
no longer working

800
00:38:00,337 --> 00:38:03,572
for an evil uberhacker--
I'm just assuming--

801
00:38:03,574 --> 00:38:05,307
Mm-hmm.

802
00:38:05,309 --> 00:38:06,909
Do you know what you're gonna do
when you get out of here?

803
00:38:06,911 --> 00:38:11,513
Oh. I'm gonna
take some time

804
00:38:11,515 --> 00:38:15,884
and gain some
much needed perspective

805
00:38:15,886 --> 00:38:20,355
and then maybe,
if you'll have me,

806
00:38:20,357 --> 00:38:21,924
come work
for you at your startup.

807
00:38:21,926 --> 00:38:23,392
Yeah. That'd be great.

808
00:38:23,394 --> 00:38:24,927
- Yeah?
- Yeah, you should.

809
00:38:24,929 --> 00:38:26,695
I mean, maybe
in a year or two,

810
00:38:26,697 --> 00:38:28,163
Curtis and I will actually have an idea
of what to develop.

811
00:38:28,165 --> 00:38:30,566
Oh, I actually--I have
a pitch for you on that.

812
00:38:30,568 --> 00:38:32,901
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

813
00:38:32,903 --> 00:38:34,803
Why did you get fired
from Palmer Tech?

814
00:38:34,805 --> 00:38:38,173
Well, besides me being
lousy at balancing my time

815
00:38:38,175 --> 00:38:39,741
and working
with the team,

816
00:38:39,743 --> 00:38:41,777
the board actually
violently resisted my--

817
00:38:41,779 --> 00:38:45,047
efforts to replicate
your spinal implant.

818
00:38:45,049 --> 00:38:46,915
Yeah.

819
00:38:46,917 --> 00:38:48,550
You've been looking
for something to work on,

820
00:38:48,552 --> 00:38:51,320
something that
would change the world,

821
00:38:51,322 --> 00:38:55,457
and you've literally been sitting
on the right idea this whole time.

822
00:38:55,459 --> 00:38:56,758
I couldn't figure out
a way to affordably

823
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,393
mass produce the implant
at Palmer Tech.

824
00:38:58,395 --> 00:39:00,896
Now you have Curtis
and no board oversight.

825
00:39:03,334 --> 00:39:05,300
You know, Curtis and I
have actually had a really hard time

826
00:39:05,302 --> 00:39:06,935
coming up with a name
for the company,

827
00:39:06,937 --> 00:39:08,971
almost as hard of a time
as we've had for a concept,

828
00:39:08,973 --> 00:39:10,873
so I was wondering
how you would feel

829
00:39:10,875 --> 00:39:15,210
about me appropriating
the name Helix?

830
00:39:15,212 --> 00:39:17,412
Well, I think you don't
generally need to worry

831
00:39:17,414 --> 00:39:18,780
about criminal hackers
coming after you

832
00:39:18,782 --> 00:39:20,816
for trademark
infringement...

833
00:39:20,818 --> 00:39:22,284
That's true.

834
00:39:22,286 --> 00:39:24,219
And I think it
would be really nice

835
00:39:24,221 --> 00:39:26,522
to see something good
come out of that name.

836
00:39:26,524 --> 00:39:28,323
Helix Dynamics.

837
00:39:28,325 --> 00:39:30,225
That rolls off
the tongue nicely.

838
00:39:30,227 --> 00:39:32,995
Cool logo possibilities,
easily engravable on a Nobel medal.

839
00:39:32,997 --> 00:39:35,397
Funny. Those are
Curtis' criteria, too.

840
00:39:35,399 --> 00:39:37,332
- Heh heh.
- It's possible.

841
00:39:42,072 --> 00:39:44,439
A reward for a job
only half done?

842
00:39:44,441 --> 00:39:45,941
A means of preventing them
from tracking you

843
00:39:45,943 --> 00:39:47,643
by way of your
Sonic scream,

844
00:39:47,645 --> 00:39:50,612
and the job was done
to perfection.

845
00:39:50,614 --> 00:39:52,581
I thought the objective
was to take down the Internet.

846
00:39:52,583 --> 00:39:54,483
No. The objective was
to take down the firewall

847
00:39:54,485 --> 00:39:56,919
protecting the vault,

848
00:39:56,921 --> 00:40:02,157
and miss Smoak was
most adept in complying.

849
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:04,493
Why couldn't you
find a way to do it yourself?

850
00:40:04,495 --> 00:40:07,996
I've been doing this
too long to leave trails, miss Lance.

851
00:40:07,998 --> 00:40:10,332
Much safer to have miss Smoak's
digital fingerprints

852
00:40:10,334 --> 00:40:12,267
on the processor,
not mine,

853
00:40:12,269 --> 00:40:14,503
and once she had
taken down the firewall,

854
00:40:14,505 --> 00:40:19,074
I was able to upload
a critical piece of code

855
00:40:19,076 --> 00:40:21,076
to Arclight.

856
00:40:21,078 --> 00:40:22,644
What happens now?

857
00:40:22,646 --> 00:40:24,513
We take the next step.

858
00:40:38,562 --> 00:40:40,796
Mmm. Dinner went
better than expected.

859
00:40:40,798 --> 00:40:44,366
Can't believe we got
through the whole thing, no interruptions...

860
00:40:44,368 --> 00:40:46,602
No armed assassins...

861
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:51,640
I, um...

862
00:40:51,642 --> 00:40:53,575
I still have room
for dessert.

863
00:40:53,577 --> 00:40:54,876
So do I.

864
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,879
Wait.
That's ok.

865
00:41:04,755 --> 00:41:07,055
- Oh, sorry.
- It's ok.

866
00:41:07,057 --> 00:41:08,590
- Sorry.
- That's ok.

867
00:41:08,592 --> 00:41:10,592
- Sorry.
- Ok. Oh!

868
00:41:10,594 --> 00:41:12,728
Sorry. Not mine.

869
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:15,163
- Thank you.
- Oh.

870
00:41:15,165 --> 00:41:17,299
- One sec.
- Yep.

871
00:41:17,301 --> 00:41:18,734
Ok.

872
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:21,403
Hello.

873
00:41:23,941 --> 00:41:25,474
Hi.

874
00:41:28,278 --> 00:41:29,645
Ok.

875
00:41:32,716 --> 00:41:35,317
I'll be there.

876
00:41:35,319 --> 00:41:37,252
Uh-uh. All right.

877
00:41:38,722 --> 00:41:40,922
That didn't sound like
John or the team.

878
00:41:40,924 --> 00:41:42,891
It wasn't.

879
00:41:42,893 --> 00:41:45,093
What's going on?

880
00:41:45,095 --> 00:41:47,129
That was Slade Wilson.

881
00:41:49,188 --> 00:41:51,088
He needs my help.

882
00:41:55,138 --> 00:42:02,038
== sync, corrected by <font color="#00FF00">elderman</font> ==
<font color="#00FFFF">@elder_man</font>

883
00:42:19,187 --> 00:42:20,887
Greg!
Move your head.
