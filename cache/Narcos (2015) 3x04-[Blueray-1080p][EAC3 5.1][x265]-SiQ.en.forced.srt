1
00:01:06,613 --> 00:01:08,574
Please, pay attention!

2
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:12,744
I need you to put your cell phones,
beepers, and radios in the container.

3
00:01:16,915 --> 00:01:18,250
Please. I'll take that.

4
00:01:37,853 --> 00:01:40,063
<i>-Gracias.</i>
-Okay.

5
00:01:41,023 --> 00:01:44,151
For the next three hours,
we'll be running silent.

6
00:01:44,776 --> 00:01:48,530
-My colleagues and I will take the lead.
-And the target?

7
00:01:49,448 --> 00:01:52,618
I'll just say that it's everything
you've trained for.

8
00:02:07,633 --> 00:02:09,009
Gentlemen, you heard!

9
00:02:09,718 --> 00:02:12,137
I need you to be tight and right.

10
00:02:12,512 --> 00:02:14,097
-Understood?
-Yes, sir!

11
00:02:14,264 --> 00:02:15,182
Let's go.

12
00:03:35,387 --> 00:03:37,639
So, what are we doing here?

13
00:03:40,308 --> 00:03:42,686
We're arresting
one of the godfathers of Cali.

14
00:05:39,135 --> 00:05:42,138
<i>Applauded by the multitude
present on 10th street,</i>

15
00:05:45,267 --> 00:05:48,270
<i>president-elect Ernesto Samper Pizano
is welcomed by the people of Colombia...</i>

16
00:06:00,282 --> 00:06:02,367
It's too early.

17
00:06:02,534 --> 00:06:05,537
-I rise early. I'm up with the sun.
-Up all right!

18
00:06:29,936 --> 00:06:30,937
Hi!

19
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,732
How did it go, honey?

20
00:06:34,983 --> 00:06:36,651
Very good! Look, what a beauty.

21
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:52,959
<i>Look at that pass. Goal!</i>

22
00:06:53,126 --> 00:06:55,837
Damn it, what sort of defence is that?
Piece of shit!

23
00:06:56,004 --> 00:06:57,422
I'm paying your fucking salaries!

24
00:07:04,679 --> 00:07:06,014
Thank you.

25
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:18,026
I can help you expand your businesses...

26
00:07:20,445 --> 00:07:22,614
I could help you make millions.

27
00:07:57,649 --> 00:08:00,110
Two units: Calderón's and mine.

28
00:08:00,276 --> 00:08:03,488
Breach one here. Breach two... here.

29
00:08:04,155 --> 00:08:07,701
Feistl, Van Ness: pool.
You come in from the back.

30
00:08:09,953 --> 00:08:12,372
-All right, let's do this already.
-Okay.

31
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:16,501
If anyone kills the godfather,
I kill you.

32
00:08:17,335 --> 00:08:20,714
We can't repeat what happened
with Escobar. I want him alive.

33
00:08:21,423 --> 00:08:22,674
Understood?

34
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:52,912
Go.

35
00:09:31,409 --> 00:09:33,119
What do you think? What do we do?

36
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,997
I think there could be hideouts here.

37
00:09:36,164 --> 00:09:38,833
-We have to check the house again.
-All right.

38
00:09:41,169 --> 00:09:44,172
Gentlemen, we're going to search
every corner of this house, understood?

39
00:09:52,514 --> 00:09:54,641
It's an elegant house in Palmira, boss.

40
00:09:54,808 --> 00:09:57,185
I don't know whose it is,
but it's not one of ours.

41
00:09:57,352 --> 00:10:00,355
Very good. Get out of there
and make sure no one sees you.

42
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:11,825
Sir.

43
00:10:15,036 --> 00:10:17,038
I need you to do something important.

44
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,041
When you leave your house,
you'll find Navegante.

45
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:21,918
He knows where you have to go.

46
00:10:23,545 --> 00:10:27,090
Of course, sir, but what should I do
with the operation I'm monitoring?

47
00:10:28,216 --> 00:10:31,553
Cordova. Give it to Cordova.

48
00:10:34,597 --> 00:10:37,100
-Be careful.
<i>-Of course, sir.</i>

49
00:10:47,443 --> 00:10:50,196
He's one of my best men.
He'll take care of it.

50
00:10:55,076 --> 00:10:56,703
You're a man of your word.

51
00:11:34,574 --> 00:11:37,452
So close to heaven and so far from God.

52
00:11:38,703 --> 00:11:40,371
Impressive.

53
00:11:41,831 --> 00:11:45,251
I'm so glad you brought me
to see the eighth wonder of the world.

54
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,965
Don't be an asshole, Pacho.

55
00:11:52,175 --> 00:11:54,761
El Paso, Texas
is what I wanted you to see.

56
00:11:55,386 --> 00:11:57,764
Fucking NAFTA changed everything, Pacho.

57
00:11:58,848 --> 00:12:01,392
It's been around for what?
Two years, more or less?

58
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:04,562
More than two million trucks
have crossed already, many of them ours.

59
00:12:05,897 --> 00:12:07,315
Filled to the brim.

60
00:12:07,982 --> 00:12:10,568
Do you know how many trucks
the Americans check?

61
00:12:11,277 --> 00:12:14,280
Less than ten percent.
It's insane. They don't have the manpower.

62
00:12:15,907 --> 00:12:17,450
Assholes opened the floodgates

63
00:12:17,617 --> 00:12:21,496
and now they stand there
with a baby's bucket to try and stop it.

64
00:12:23,957 --> 00:12:26,501
This is the right business.
I already know this, man.

65
00:12:26,668 --> 00:12:28,336
No, man. What I'm saying is,

66
00:12:28,503 --> 00:12:32,507
you're getting out of the right business
at the exact wrong time.

67
00:12:32,674 --> 00:12:34,467
And you're going to regret it.

68
00:12:36,761 --> 00:12:37,762
You want some?

69
00:12:42,642 --> 00:12:46,229
Amado, are you suggesting
that I betray my partners?

70
00:12:46,396 --> 00:12:49,399
No. No way. Why betray?
They want to get out.

71
00:12:52,193 --> 00:12:56,114
I'm proposing that we start something new,
you and I.

72
00:12:57,115 --> 00:13:00,535
Just imagine it:
You send it to me, I get it across.

73
00:13:00,702 --> 00:13:03,705
In two years, we'll be flooding
this fucking shitty country.

74
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:09,752
Think about it, all right? Think about it.

75
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:12,755
Just don't take too long,
because in six months,

76
00:13:12,922 --> 00:13:14,424
I need to secure a new supply.

77
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,012
Hopefully, it will be with you.

78
00:13:30,732 --> 00:13:32,400
Give it another once-over?

79
00:14:00,511 --> 00:14:01,804
Thirty seconds.

80
00:14:10,104 --> 00:14:12,065
Hey! You can't park there!

81
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:14,692
Damn truck.

82
00:14:15,526 --> 00:14:17,779
These fucking trucks
are always breaking down.

83
00:14:17,945 --> 00:14:18,821
What's up? You can't park here.

84
00:14:18,988 --> 00:14:20,907
Let me just grab the cables
and I'll move it.

85
00:14:21,074 --> 00:14:22,200
Move the fucking truck.

86
00:14:32,418 --> 00:14:33,878
-That's the one Lady Di uses.
-Really?

87
00:14:36,923 --> 00:14:38,925
Someone's ringing the doorbell!

88
00:14:40,843 --> 00:14:44,138
-Careful.
-Sorry, wait just a moment.

89
00:14:44,305 --> 00:14:46,849
Let me get the door.

90
00:14:47,392 --> 00:14:48,226
Look.

91
00:14:58,444 --> 00:15:01,447
Police! Back up. Quickly! Move it!

92
00:15:03,282 --> 00:15:04,367
Quickly! Move it!

93
00:15:04,534 --> 00:15:06,452
What's going on?

94
00:15:07,036 --> 00:15:09,997
Sit down, ladies.
Sit down, ladies, I won't say it again.

95
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,377
You can't come in here. Get out.

96
00:15:22,343 --> 00:15:23,636
He's fucking running!

97
00:15:41,654 --> 00:15:44,157
Get up! Look at my face!

98
00:15:46,075 --> 00:15:46,868
Let's go.

99
00:15:47,034 --> 00:15:50,955
-Sit down, miss.
-I already told you, Gilberto is not home.

100
00:15:51,122 --> 00:15:52,665
Did he contact anyone?

101
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:55,334
-No one, Colonel.
-No? All good?

102
00:15:56,043 --> 00:15:59,797
Mrs. Rodriguez, I have a federal warrant
signed and executed by myself,

103
00:15:59,964 --> 00:16:02,925
as representative
of the Colombian National Police.

104
00:16:05,595 --> 00:16:08,389
The question is, will you cooperate?

105
00:16:39,212 --> 00:16:40,379
Are you all right?

106
00:16:41,797 --> 00:16:42,757
Yes.

107
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,512
It's good here.

108
00:16:56,395 --> 00:16:58,731
The only thing left
is to demolish the house.

109
00:17:07,031 --> 00:17:09,200
I'm sorry, I thought we had something.

110
00:17:09,909 --> 00:17:11,202
Welcome to my world.

111
00:17:12,912 --> 00:17:13,913
Well...

112
00:17:32,181 --> 00:17:35,268
Look, when we get there,
I think it's better if I go in alone.

113
00:17:36,477 --> 00:17:37,853
These people are angry.

114
00:17:38,854 --> 00:17:41,857
What we're asking of them,
it's an insult on top of their grief.

115
00:17:46,153 --> 00:17:48,155
You're different, Jorge Salcedo.

116
00:17:51,117 --> 00:17:52,535
Different? How?

117
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:56,914
You're crippled. You don't carry a gun.

118
00:18:00,126 --> 00:18:02,295
Most people don't carry guns.

119
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:07,758
Yeah... but you're not most people.

120
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:12,138
And that's why it's so weird. Interesting.

121
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,807
That you never carry a gun.

122
00:18:18,769 --> 00:18:20,605
I see. Why do you think that is?

123
00:18:21,355 --> 00:18:22,356
I don't know.

124
00:18:23,733 --> 00:18:24,817
Maybe you're scared.

125
00:18:30,489 --> 00:18:33,993
Fear... of what you could do with it.

126
00:18:35,328 --> 00:18:39,165
That you've been walking around a killer
and never knew it.

127
00:19:00,978 --> 00:19:02,188
Pedrito, go in the house!

128
00:19:05,274 --> 00:19:08,903
Good afternoon, Mrs. Salazar.
Calm down, Mrs. Salazar. Calm down.

129
00:19:09,987 --> 00:19:12,990
My name is Jorge Salcedo.
I'd like to speak with you, if I could.

130
00:19:15,368 --> 00:19:17,578
Go right back to where you came from

131
00:19:17,745 --> 00:19:21,540
and tell that whore
if she wants my grandson,

132
00:19:21,707 --> 00:19:24,043
she can come looking for him.

133
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:25,795
I just came to talk.

134
00:19:26,545 --> 00:19:28,172
If you don't like what I have to say,

135
00:19:28,339 --> 00:19:30,341
I'll go back to Cali
and deliver whatever message you want.

136
00:19:30,508 --> 00:19:32,551
I'm unarmed. I'm here to talk.

137
00:19:33,344 --> 00:19:36,347
Your boss murdered my son...
to take up with his whore wife.

138
00:19:39,308 --> 00:19:42,311
And now you come to take my grandson
far from the only family he has left.

139
00:19:44,021 --> 00:19:47,525
I know this is not what you want to hear.
But she is his mother.

140
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:50,486
And Miguel Rodriguez is protecting her.

141
00:19:51,404 --> 00:19:52,571
Protecting?

142
00:19:54,031 --> 00:19:55,825
Is that what they call it now?

143
00:19:57,201 --> 00:19:58,744
And he will be protected as well.

144
00:19:58,911 --> 00:20:01,914
And if you let me take him back, I promise
you can see him whenever you'd like.

145
00:20:04,834 --> 00:20:07,670
You promise. How nice of you.

146
00:20:09,296 --> 00:20:11,465
Who told you I would do that?

147
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:14,802
I have him here and I can see him
whenever I want and protect him.

148
00:20:16,387 --> 00:20:18,556
That bitch made her choice.

149
00:20:19,932 --> 00:20:23,602
Mrs. Salazar... please accept my offer.

150
00:20:24,478 --> 00:20:28,190
The next men who come... won't be asking.

151
00:20:28,357 --> 00:20:29,608
There will be war.

152
00:20:34,655 --> 00:20:37,825
Why don't you ask my sons?
See what they think.

153
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:10,191
What is this?

154
00:21:21,577 --> 00:21:23,329
-Colonel Martinez.
-Captain.

155
00:21:24,205 --> 00:21:26,123
You know what's happening here?

156
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:28,042
Yes, I think I know.

157
00:21:28,209 --> 00:21:30,169
I'm giving you one chance

158
00:21:30,711 --> 00:21:34,173
to do the right thing
and not fuck up this operation.

159
00:21:40,971 --> 00:21:42,515
You think you're clever?

160
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:46,894
You're in Cali. Cali is my city.
This isn't Bogotà.

161
00:21:47,686 --> 00:21:49,688
You're way out of line here, Hugo.

162
00:21:51,941 --> 00:21:52,900
Perhaps.

163
00:22:05,746 --> 00:22:07,039
He's here. We'll find him.

164
00:22:10,876 --> 00:22:12,044
Watch him.

165
00:22:19,552 --> 00:22:21,011
I'm unarmed. I didn't come for a fight.

166
00:22:21,178 --> 00:22:23,764
We're going to send your fucking head
back to Miguel in a fucking box.

167
00:22:24,473 --> 00:22:27,101
-Walk, motherfucker.
-Let's go.

168
00:22:33,649 --> 00:22:34,859
Bring out the car.

169
00:22:35,484 --> 00:22:39,238
Pedro. Let's go. I'm taking you
to your mother. Take my hand.

170
00:22:40,656 --> 00:22:43,826
-Very good.
-Shut your fucking mouth or I kill her.

171
00:22:46,495 --> 00:22:49,665
All right, my lady.
Make like a statue or I shoot your ass.

172
00:22:50,249 --> 00:22:51,750
I'm getting in first, you hear?

173
00:22:52,751 --> 00:22:53,961
Real still.

174
00:22:54,128 --> 00:22:57,464
You're taking the boy.
What else do you want?

175
00:22:57,631 --> 00:22:58,549
Relax.

176
00:22:58,716 --> 00:23:00,676
-Stop!
-Mama!

177
00:23:00,843 --> 00:23:02,219
What else, motherfucker?

178
00:23:05,222 --> 00:23:06,640
Fucking asshole!

179
00:24:43,028 --> 00:24:43,862
Drop the weapon.

180
00:24:51,036 --> 00:24:52,246
Drop the weapon.

181
00:24:57,084 --> 00:24:58,210
Don't shoot.

182
00:24:59,294 --> 00:25:00,963
I'm a man of peace.

183
00:25:20,524 --> 00:25:21,400
Let's go.

184
00:26:20,626 --> 00:26:22,211
Hey! Stop!

185
00:26:23,462 --> 00:26:25,339
Colonel! Calderón took off.

186
00:26:31,929 --> 00:26:34,014
-Do you have a phone in there?
-Yes, in there.

187
00:26:44,274 --> 00:26:46,276
They got Gilberto and they're moving
towards the aerial base.

188
00:26:46,443 --> 00:26:48,278
The whole workforce is on this.

189
00:26:49,363 --> 00:26:52,366
<i>They're not going to leave the city.
Tell all the men to be alert. Understood?</i>

190
00:27:12,469 --> 00:27:13,679
Move it, asshole.

191
00:27:21,687 --> 00:27:24,148
They'll try to take us on the road.

192
00:27:24,731 --> 00:27:25,899
Guns out!

193
00:27:28,777 --> 00:27:32,281
<i>Cleaning, cooking, working.</i>

194
00:27:34,867 --> 00:27:35,701
Hello.

195
00:27:36,243 --> 00:27:39,246
<i>-Don Miguel... something's happened.</i>
-What happened?

196
00:27:40,581 --> 00:27:43,584
I'm outside Gilberto's house.
They got him. They got your brother.

197
00:28:17,701 --> 00:28:20,579
<i>We've got a visual.</i>

198
00:28:23,248 --> 00:28:25,083
Surround him in the market!

199
00:28:47,147 --> 00:28:49,566
Look! There he goes! Faster!

200
00:28:51,318 --> 00:28:53,153
Let's get him on the next turn!

201
00:28:59,117 --> 00:29:01,370
Hold your fire!

202
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:09,878
Driver! Put your hands
where I can see them!

203
00:29:11,505 --> 00:29:12,506
Driver!

204
00:29:15,008 --> 00:29:16,343
Out further!

205
00:29:17,678 --> 00:29:18,637
<i>Further'.</i>

206
00:29:26,895 --> 00:29:28,814
Get out.

207
00:29:29,731 --> 00:29:30,732
Open the back.

208
00:29:30,899 --> 00:29:33,110
-Okay. Let me get the keys.
-Open it.

209
00:29:47,791 --> 00:29:48,667
Open it.

210
00:30:01,305 --> 00:30:05,225
Those American sons of bitches tricked us.
We've got the wrong fucking truck!

211
00:30:06,018 --> 00:30:07,853
They're going to the air field.
We'll get them there.

212
00:30:09,313 --> 00:30:10,814
I took care of security.

213
00:30:10,981 --> 00:30:13,984
Let those sons of bitches
try to touch us again.

214
00:30:16,445 --> 00:30:18,864
Send Salcedo's beeper another message.

215
00:30:35,881 --> 00:30:37,966
Uncle! It's me, Nicolas!

216
00:30:41,636 --> 00:30:42,596
Come in.

217
00:30:45,432 --> 00:30:46,850
-Nicolas.
-Uncle.

218
00:30:52,272 --> 00:30:54,399
-Is it true?
-Yes.

219
00:30:56,193 --> 00:30:57,444
They got him.

220
00:30:58,695 --> 00:31:01,114
Nicolas, why don't you go home
and wait there?

221
00:31:01,281 --> 00:31:03,408
Once something happens, I'll call you.

222
00:31:03,575 --> 00:31:05,202
No, sir, I have to help.

223
00:31:07,579 --> 00:31:08,538
Come.

224
00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:12,584
You know your dad
doesn't want you mixed up in this.

225
00:31:13,585 --> 00:31:16,463
We have to have faith that your dad
won't be taken out of Cali.

226
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:17,381
And if he is?

227
00:31:17,547 --> 00:31:20,550
Why did we waste all of that money
on my education? I'm a lawyer.

228
00:31:21,968 --> 00:31:23,887
I'm taking the first flight to Bogotà.

229
00:31:24,054 --> 00:31:25,430
I want to help him.

230
00:31:26,556 --> 00:31:28,725
Let's hope that's not necessary.

231
00:32:51,516 --> 00:32:52,893
Sir, please don't come any closer.

232
00:32:53,059 --> 00:32:56,062
Your men are impeding the transport
and arrest of a fugitive under warrant.

233
00:32:59,316 --> 00:33:00,400
You know it.

234
00:33:01,067 --> 00:33:02,444
And that means prison.

235
00:33:07,491 --> 00:33:09,117
What you do today...

236
00:33:10,702 --> 00:33:12,329
what you do this moment...

237
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:14,664
defines you.

238
00:33:15,332 --> 00:33:17,000
For the rest of your lives.

239
00:33:22,631 --> 00:33:24,174
Are you police or not?

240
00:33:33,975 --> 00:33:35,268
That's better.

241
00:34:40,458 --> 00:34:41,585
Shit!

242
00:34:45,672 --> 00:34:46,881
<i>What's up? It's me.</i>

243
00:34:47,382 --> 00:34:50,135
-About fucking time.
-/ was out of <i>range.</i>

244
00:34:50,302 --> 00:34:51,928
<i>They arrested Gilberto.</i>

245
00:34:53,638 --> 00:34:55,557
-What?
-They got him, Jorge.

246
00:34:56,057 --> 00:34:57,475
They got Gilberto.

247
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:03,607
-You were monitoring the raid.
<i>-But</i> they never mentioned <i>Gilberto</i> 's name.

248
00:35:03,773 --> 00:35:07,569
Even so, we checked all the tapes.
It's impossible.

249
00:35:14,618 --> 00:35:17,621
Brother... they got him.
They took him away.

250
00:35:19,623 --> 00:35:20,665
We got beat.

251
00:35:21,291 --> 00:35:22,792
Get back here quick.

252
00:35:46,608 --> 00:35:47,567
Take that.

253
00:35:58,244 --> 00:36:00,497
Five seconds to take photos, no more.

254
00:36:00,664 --> 00:36:01,873
Congratulations.

255
00:36:02,749 --> 00:36:04,918
But you know this won't hold up.

256
00:36:05,335 --> 00:36:08,922
You're fucking with things
that are much bigger than you are.

257
00:36:11,049 --> 00:36:14,886
Smile, Gilberto. You're about to be on TV.

258
00:36:19,474 --> 00:36:22,435
Mr. Rodriguez, do you have a response
to the charges against you?

259
00:36:22,602 --> 00:36:25,188
Conspiring to export cocaine
and illegal enrichment?

260
00:36:25,355 --> 00:36:26,481
Enough. Let's go.

261
00:36:26,648 --> 00:36:30,402
Do you have anything to say
to the people of Cali? Mr. Rodriguez.

262
00:38:23,723 --> 00:38:25,308
-My love!
-Mom my!

263
00:38:29,854 --> 00:38:32,106
-Are you hungry? No?
-No.

264
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:37,028
How cute. Looks a lot like his dad.

265
00:38:40,323 --> 00:38:43,284
Come on.
Mom will read you a story in a bit.

266
00:38:43,451 --> 00:38:44,828
Go. I'll be right there.

267
00:38:46,538 --> 00:38:47,997
Thanks for showing up, Jorge.

268
00:38:53,962 --> 00:38:56,506
Sir, we don't know how much the DEA knows.

269
00:38:56,673 --> 00:39:00,552
We need to assume
all your current homes are... unsafe.

270
00:39:03,096 --> 00:39:04,597
I'll stay here for now.

271
00:39:10,019 --> 00:39:10,895
We all need to talk.

272
00:39:15,191 --> 00:39:18,194
What did you expect? A warrant
by definition authorizes the police...

273
00:39:20,029 --> 00:39:23,825
Wait. Let's not lie to ourselves.

274
00:39:23,992 --> 00:39:27,579
This operation was run
by the Drug Enforcement Administration

275
00:39:27,745 --> 00:39:28,997
of the United States.

276
00:39:29,163 --> 00:39:32,000
The takedown, Mr. Attorney General,
was National Police.

277
00:39:32,584 --> 00:39:34,377
The transport was by our police.

278
00:39:34,544 --> 00:39:36,629
The booking was by our police.

279
00:39:36,796 --> 00:39:39,173
So a war started by National Police?

280
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:41,509
Look, as Attorney General,

281
00:39:41,676 --> 00:39:44,679
my main... concern is achieving
a peaceful settlement with the godfathers.

282
00:39:47,265 --> 00:39:49,726
And the arrest
of Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela

283
00:39:49,893 --> 00:39:53,688
means we now have new leverage
to negotiate with.

284
00:39:54,772 --> 00:39:57,901
The President of Colombia, Ernesto Samper.

285
00:40:02,906 --> 00:40:04,991
I hate to be late to a good debate.

286
00:40:05,491 --> 00:40:08,995
You know us, might as well
try to smooth rough water with a hammer.

287
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,833
I've been apprised by Minister Botero

288
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,628
about our newly-incarcerated
Cali godfather.

289
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:21,215
-With all due respect, Mr. President?
-Go ahead, Miguel.

290
00:40:22,383 --> 00:40:26,137
We've worked for months
to negotiate this surrender.

291
00:40:27,347 --> 00:40:30,725
We recommend the immediate release
of Mr. Rodriguez Orejuela.

292
00:40:33,436 --> 00:40:35,271
Colombia is a nation of laws.

293
00:40:36,356 --> 00:40:37,732
Not of concessions.

294
00:40:38,983 --> 00:40:41,819
If I give a pass to the largest criminal
organization in the world...

295
00:40:42,862 --> 00:40:45,573
the trust of the people
will be lost forever.

296
00:40:48,284 --> 00:40:50,662
Mr. Rodriguez is entitled
to the same due process

297
00:40:50,828 --> 00:40:52,789
as any Colombian citizen.

298
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,292
Let's see where due process gets him.

299
00:40:59,253 --> 00:41:00,254
For now...

300
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:03,591
his arrest stands.

301
00:41:05,009 --> 00:41:06,094
Thank you, gentlemen.

302
00:41:25,697 --> 00:41:27,031
Thank you very much.

303
00:41:59,731 --> 00:42:03,568
We talked about this.
I don't want the stink of this on you.

304
00:42:03,735 --> 00:42:04,736
Relax, Dad.

305
00:42:05,153 --> 00:42:08,781
I'm a lawyer. I'm the only one
in the family who can visit you.

306
00:42:12,577 --> 00:42:15,580
Besides, I thought you could use
a friendly face.

307
00:42:18,332 --> 00:42:21,335
What I could really use
is a tumbler of whiskey about this big.

308
00:42:28,551 --> 00:42:29,510
How's it look?

309
00:42:31,596 --> 00:42:33,347
The warrants are old.

310
00:42:34,891 --> 00:42:37,185
-Invalid?
-Vulnerable.

311
00:42:38,603 --> 00:42:42,065
I have a lunch tomorrow at 1:00 pm.
with the Colombian Board of Pharmacies.

312
00:42:42,231 --> 00:42:44,233
8:00 a.m., latest, I'm out.

313
00:42:45,151 --> 00:42:48,154
Dad, you're here until our lawyers
get you in front of a judge.

314
00:42:48,821 --> 00:42:51,824
And he'll hold you here in Bogotà
due to the conspiracy charge.

315
00:42:54,952 --> 00:42:56,120
I don't get it.

316
00:42:56,704 --> 00:42:58,790
This is a mistake, a blunder.

317
00:42:58,956 --> 00:43:02,543
A gross overstep
by a rogue American agent!

318
00:43:03,127 --> 00:43:05,046
That's what you want to believe.

319
00:43:05,296 --> 00:43:07,340
But if that was the case,
you'd be out by now.

320
00:43:10,718 --> 00:43:13,387
-Dad, this is real.
-No, money is real.

321
00:43:13,554 --> 00:43:15,431
And what about all I've paid?

322
00:43:16,766 --> 00:43:19,519
Sons of bitches
can't leave me confined here.

323
00:43:23,523 --> 00:43:26,901
How the fuck did they surprise us
like that, gentlemen?

324
00:43:27,527 --> 00:43:28,569
It was Calderón.

325
00:43:31,197 --> 00:43:33,366
Dad, I say we tear him to pieces.

326
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:36,953
-And his fucking family and his children.
-David, please.

327
00:43:38,496 --> 00:43:41,666
Obviously, there's responsibility
on all sides.

328
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,962
-Cordova...
-Sir, just as we realized...

329
00:43:46,129 --> 00:43:47,421
By the time you realized,

330
00:43:47,588 --> 00:43:50,591
Colonel Martinez had already been
in my brother's house for 30 minutes.

331
00:43:53,219 --> 00:43:55,721
Don Miguel. The failure's mine.

332
00:43:55,888 --> 00:43:58,474
When it comes to the DEA,
Cordova counts on me.

333
00:44:00,893 --> 00:44:03,896
Wait. Cordova, you're my brother's
personal head of security.

334
00:44:06,732 --> 00:44:07,733
Yes, sir.

335
00:44:08,484 --> 00:44:10,653
Then you should've been there.

336
00:44:11,946 --> 00:44:15,408
Your men should've been there.

337
00:44:16,576 --> 00:44:19,579
Your guards were fooled
by a fucking chicken truck.

338
00:44:22,915 --> 00:44:25,168
I want to know what the fuck
is happening here.

339
00:44:25,793 --> 00:44:28,796
Because I'm starting to believe
that none of us are safe.

340
00:44:32,425 --> 00:44:33,384
Not your families...

341
00:44:37,889 --> 00:44:38,848
and not mine.

342
00:44:40,224 --> 00:44:41,267
My family.

343
00:44:47,273 --> 00:44:50,860
Thank you, Attorney General Valdivieso,
Defence Minister Botero.

344
00:46:16,487 --> 00:46:18,239
Colonel, please.

345
00:46:19,073 --> 00:46:20,366
Thanks.

346
00:46:39,135 --> 00:46:40,469
What are you talking about?

347
00:47:18,424 --> 00:47:20,843
I turned in my weapon and my badge.

348
00:47:24,138 --> 00:47:25,222
Good luck.

349
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:27,641
Colonel...

350
00:47:30,644 --> 00:47:31,729
I'm sorry.

351
00:47:38,778 --> 00:47:41,781
Men like me would give our lives
to arrest a man like him.

352
00:47:46,035 --> 00:47:47,453
You did everything right, Peña.

353
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:51,207
But now you're all alone.

354
00:48:22,947 --> 00:48:25,074
We need to talk about your security.

355
00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:28,911
Let me be in charge.

356
00:48:30,788 --> 00:48:32,206
I'll protect you, Dad.

357
00:48:35,709 --> 00:48:38,170
Now's not the time for a change.

358
00:48:43,843 --> 00:48:47,221
We need to keep things on track
until your uncle is back.

359
00:48:52,017 --> 00:48:53,561
What if he doesn't come back?

360
00:49:29,013 --> 00:49:31,348
-They got Gilberto.
<i>-I don't understand.</i>

361
00:49:31,515 --> 00:49:34,226
I thought Gilberto
had this all under control.

362
00:49:34,602 --> 00:49:35,769
<i>So did I.</i>

363
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:38,981
And what now?

364
00:49:39,565 --> 00:49:40,941
<i>This could get messy.</i>

365
00:49:41,108 --> 00:49:44,111
<i>Stay where you are.
Right now, we look out for ourselves.</i>

366
00:49:46,238 --> 00:49:49,366
<i>Pacho... be smart.</i>

367
00:49:51,494 --> 00:49:52,912
<i>For now, we wait.</i>

368
00:49:53,412 --> 00:49:55,581
You stay there a while longer.

369
00:49:56,207 --> 00:49:58,751
We have to keep everything running.

370
00:49:59,627 --> 00:50:02,630
<i>The health of the business
has never been more important. Understand?</i>

371
00:50:06,050 --> 00:50:07,134
Yes. Of course.

372
00:50:10,429 --> 00:50:12,431
You listening to me, motherfucker?
