1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,168
Previously on "The Flash"...

2
00:00:01,171 --> 00:00:03,935
- Caitlin!
- Dad.

3
00:00:03,938 --> 00:00:05,838
I'll always love you.

4
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,640
You took our daughter
back to the future?

5
00:00:07,642 --> 00:00:09,342
I can't trust her.

6
00:00:09,344 --> 00:00:11,770
Thawne is manipulating her.

7
00:00:11,773 --> 00:00:14,347
Follow my instructions
and we will defeat Cicada,

8
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:15,575
destroy his dagger,

9
00:00:15,578 --> 00:00:16,783
and save your father.

10
00:00:16,785 --> 00:00:19,385
- You created your own Speed Force?
- Yes, I did.

11
00:00:19,387 --> 00:00:21,421
And I can access it to go back in time.

12
00:00:21,423 --> 00:00:23,523
- How could he leave me?
- Nora...

13
00:00:23,525 --> 00:00:25,491
How could he stop loving me?

14
00:00:26,661 --> 00:00:28,795
- She's gone.
- Gone where?

15
00:00:28,797 --> 00:00:31,697
I don't know where.
I only know when: 2019.

16
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,843
Gideon, scan servers for blueprints

17
00:00:43,845 --> 00:00:46,446
from McCulloch Technologies.

18
00:00:49,684 --> 00:00:51,751
Gotcha.

19
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:03,563
Gideon, infiltration analysis.

20
00:01:03,565 --> 00:01:05,898
Yes, Nora West-Allen.

21
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,134
The odds of accessing
this location on your own

22
00:01:08,136 --> 00:01:09,735
are 1 in 3 million.

23
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:12,071
Shall I send a request to Barry Allen?

24
00:01:12,073 --> 00:01:13,506
No, Gideon.

25
00:01:13,508 --> 00:01:15,820
I need people who can actually help me.

26
00:01:15,823 --> 00:01:19,176

27
00:01:27,622 --> 00:01:28,988
Tachyon scanners set up

28
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:31,157
at every half-mile
interval across the city.

29
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:33,226
And the seismometer is
searching for sonic booms

30
00:01:33,228 --> 00:01:34,861
in the hundred-megahertz range.

31
00:01:34,863 --> 00:01:37,797
As for the satellites,
I've got Carrie, Charlotte,

32
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:39,966
Miranda, and Samantha scanning

33
00:01:39,968 --> 00:01:42,034
for her yellow-purple
lightning signatures.

34
00:01:42,036 --> 00:01:44,270
I am clearly the Samantha
of this group, right?

35
00:01:44,272 --> 00:01:46,272
- Yeah, okay, Miranda.
- Ugh.

36
00:01:46,274 --> 00:01:49,175
So, technically, if Nora
uses the Speed Force...

37
00:01:49,177 --> 00:01:51,410
We'll find her.

38
00:01:56,417 --> 00:01:58,084
Kinda thought she'd pop right up.

39
00:01:58,086 --> 00:01:59,118
If she's even here.

40
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,586
How can you guys be so sure

41
00:02:00,588 --> 00:02:02,823
that she even came back from
the future in the first place?

42
00:02:02,825 --> 00:02:04,141
Because Thawne sent her.

43
00:02:04,144 --> 00:02:05,644
He showed her a new way to time-travel,

44
00:02:05,646 --> 00:02:07,142
something that can't be detected.

45
00:02:07,145 --> 00:02:09,095
But as soon as she starts running again,

46
00:02:09,098 --> 00:02:10,396
we're gonna be able to bring her home.

47
00:02:10,398 --> 00:02:12,198
Well, Team Flash,

48
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,735
Nora West-Allen is not the
only time traveler who's absent.

49
00:02:15,737 --> 00:02:17,138
We've been running down
abandoned buildings,

50
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,504
- foreclosed condos...
- Anywhere that Grace Gibbons

51
00:02:19,507 --> 00:02:21,173
may have hidden her younger self, but...

52
00:02:21,175 --> 00:02:22,141
We got bupkis.

53
00:02:22,143 --> 00:02:23,275
And we have no idea why

54
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:25,378
she stole the Cryo-Atomizer,

55
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:29,012
except that it was
worth killing my dad for.

56
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:31,350
Hey, if you need more time...

57
00:02:31,352 --> 00:02:33,486
Yeah, we're more than capable of chasing

58
00:02:33,488 --> 00:02:36,589
a wild goose or two on our own.

59
00:02:36,591 --> 00:02:38,520
Thank you, I'm fine.

60
00:02:38,523 --> 00:02:40,256
I'd rather be working.

61
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:41,861
On that note, I'm happy to help you

62
00:02:41,863 --> 00:02:43,195
follow that lead on the atomizer.

63
00:02:43,197 --> 00:02:44,597
Really?

64
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:47,733
- What about... Sherluck?
- Sherloque.

65
00:02:47,735 --> 00:02:49,969
Do you think any of you will
get this right at any point

66
00:02:49,971 --> 00:02:51,604
at any time in your life? Sherloque.

67
00:02:51,606 --> 00:02:54,573
No, I'm going to continue
the quest for Nora West-Allen.

68
00:02:54,575 --> 00:02:58,911
I... feel somewhat responsible.

69
00:02:58,913 --> 00:03:00,546
Hmm.

70
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:03,916
Hey, it's CCPD... There was a break-in

71
00:03:03,918 --> 00:03:05,851
at an architecture firm
on 34th and Williamson.

72
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:06,986
Meta-suspect.

73
00:03:06,988 --> 00:03:08,788
Citizens reporting an explosion there.

74
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:11,323
Sounds like you guys might
need an extra set of hands.

75
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:12,992
I'll grab my gear.

76
00:03:12,994 --> 00:03:15,261
Oh.

77
00:03:15,263 --> 00:03:17,563
There's an alert at my
dad's old lab in the Arctic.

78
00:03:17,565 --> 00:03:19,432
We should check it out.

79
00:03:19,434 --> 00:03:20,900
Yeah, better wash my long johns.

80
00:03:20,902 --> 00:03:22,168
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

81
00:03:23,204 --> 00:03:24,203
You gonna get that or...

82
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:25,204
Yeah, I'm going to get it,

83
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:26,972
but I know already it's Renée Aldler...

84
00:03:26,974 --> 00:03:28,059
- Adler.
- Adler.

85
00:03:28,062 --> 00:03:30,876
With these emoticon pictogram
things that she send me.

86
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:34,180
Oh, master detective like
you can't decode a few emojis?

87
00:03:34,182 --> 00:03:36,515
I can decode these
emojis no problem, huh?

88
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:38,851
Heart, she like me. Kissy
face, want to kiss me.

89
00:03:38,853 --> 00:03:41,120
Peach, eggplant, she
like fruit and vegetable.

90
00:03:41,122 --> 00:03:43,222
At this point with the
other Renée Aldlers,

91
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:45,391
we are not keeping
secrets from one another.

92
00:03:45,393 --> 00:03:46,459
Well, I did it.

93
00:03:46,461 --> 00:03:50,029
Every exercise, every intention,

94
00:03:50,031 --> 00:03:52,231
and now that Kamilla
and I are hunky-dory...

95
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:54,266
You have completed the Book of Ralph.

96
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:55,935
- I sure did.
- Thank you for your service,

97
00:03:55,937 --> 00:03:57,618
old friend, but your job isn't done yet.

98
00:03:57,621 --> 00:03:58,885
Shirley, I think you could use this.

99
00:03:58,887 --> 00:04:00,039
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

100
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,474
What, do you think I
need help with a breakup?

101
00:04:01,476 --> 00:04:03,074
Oh, come on. Look, Addendum C...

102
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:04,436
Appendix four.

103
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:06,545
A guide to taking your
relationship to the next level.

104
00:04:06,547 --> 00:04:08,047
It worked for Cisco.

105
00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:09,849
Barely worked for young Ralph Macchio.

106
00:04:09,851 --> 00:04:11,879
No, no, no. This guy,
he's chicken, right?

107
00:04:11,882 --> 00:04:13,385
Even in his current relationship,

108
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:14,587
he's too afraid to tell this girl

109
00:04:14,589 --> 00:04:15,821
that he's actually Vibe, right?

110
00:04:15,823 --> 00:04:17,156
I'm actually not afraid.

111
00:04:17,158 --> 00:04:19,225
I'm gonna tell her when I'm ready.

112
00:04:19,227 --> 00:04:20,459
It's just hard to navigate

113
00:04:20,461 --> 00:04:22,161
the meta-life, personal-life balance.

114
00:04:22,163 --> 00:04:23,974
More like chicken-life balance, hmm?

115
00:04:23,977 --> 00:04:26,076
Man, you're a chicken
personal-life balance.

116
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:27,569
I can tell her whenever I want.

117
00:04:27,572 --> 00:04:29,108
Well, then tell her
right now, why don't you?

118
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,243
You want me to tell her right now?

119
00:04:30,245 --> 00:04:31,345
- Yeah.
- I'll tell her right now.

120
00:04:31,347 --> 00:04:32,747
I just got... well, you know.

121
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,817
I have spotty reception in the elevator.

122
00:04:33,819 --> 00:04:34,730
Come on out and do it.

123
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:35,719
Well, you know, I gotta get to work.

124
00:04:35,721 --> 00:04:38,179
- Come on out and do it.
- I gotta get to work.

125
00:04:42,126 --> 00:04:43,892
I just talked to one
of the architects here,

126
00:04:43,895 --> 00:04:45,917
and G. Simone & Associates used to do

127
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,920
all of this high-profile design work...

128
00:04:47,922 --> 00:04:49,601
Casinos, banks, military bases...

129
00:04:49,604 --> 00:04:52,757
But apparently, last
year, they had been working

130
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,147
with an anonymous client.

131
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,194
So because our thief covered his tracks,

132
00:04:56,197 --> 00:04:57,997
we have no idea who
that client might be.

133
00:04:57,999 --> 00:04:59,698
Hey.

134
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,500
Look at this.

135
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:03,135
Look at these hard drives.

136
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:06,169
Fried from the inside, like
in a massive power surge.

137
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:08,371
A server like this would
have a surge protector, right?

138
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:10,009
A typical metal-oxide varistor

139
00:05:10,011 --> 00:05:12,011
protects against a thousand joules.

140
00:05:12,013 --> 00:05:14,380
How many joules does
a lightning bolt have?

141
00:05:14,382 --> 00:05:15,347
A billion.

142
00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:16,582
What, you think this was Nora?

143
00:05:16,584 --> 00:05:18,179
No, this couldn't have been.

144
00:05:18,182 --> 00:05:20,035
I mean, our scanners
would've picked her up.

145
00:05:20,038 --> 00:05:22,721
Yeah, about that... I
just picked up a frak-ton

146
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:24,523
of background particle radiation.

147
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:27,426
Particles? Tachyons?

148
00:05:27,428 --> 00:05:28,427
Negative tachyons.

149
00:05:28,429 --> 00:05:29,530
That's a thing?

150
00:05:29,533 --> 00:05:30,566
I mean, negative tachyons

151
00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:31,901
can't generate lightning, right?

152
00:05:31,904 --> 00:05:33,832
Unless negative tachyons

153
00:05:33,835 --> 00:05:36,435
don't just offset positive
ones like we thought.

154
00:05:36,437 --> 00:05:39,271
Maybe they actually
siphon positive tachyons.

155
00:05:39,273 --> 00:05:43,275
Stealing speed from the
Speed Force like a parasite?

156
00:05:43,277 --> 00:05:45,110
That's what Thawne taught her how to do.

157
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:48,080
She's using negative tachyons
to run and avoid our scanners.

158
00:05:48,082 --> 00:05:50,282
Yeah, but why would Nora
be trying to avoid us?

159
00:05:50,284 --> 00:05:52,718
I don't know, but if
she's stealing blueprints,

160
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,487
this ain't gonna be her last stop.

161
00:06:07,635 --> 00:06:08,968
Pretty paint job.

162
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,637
Predators know these
colors get you stung.

163
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,530
Yeah, it's always a great idea

164
00:06:13,533 --> 00:06:15,340
for a thief to draw
attention to herself.

165
00:06:15,343 --> 00:06:18,277
At least I don't fly around
in a fuzzy green sweater.

166
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:21,847
Didn't think I'd recognize
Weather Wizard's kid?

167
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:24,783
It's Weather Witch. I have a name, okay?

168
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:26,061
Bug-Eyed Bandit.

169
00:06:26,064 --> 00:06:29,299
Don't call me that. That's their name.

170
00:06:29,302 --> 00:06:32,191
I heard you took your
robot bee act to Star City.

171
00:06:32,193 --> 00:06:34,441
Something about curing a spinal tumor?

172
00:06:34,444 --> 00:06:37,647
Well, I heard you and your
other half were in Bolivia.

173
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:40,598
Or did Silver Ghost ditch you?

174
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:42,268
Van Zandt talked a big game.

175
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,203
She tried to recruit me too.

176
00:06:44,205 --> 00:06:45,804
What did she want to call us?

177
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:46,739
Young...

178
00:07:05,426 --> 00:07:06,992
Rag Doll, right?

179
00:07:06,994 --> 00:07:09,140
You blew up the Seaver Building.

180
00:07:09,143 --> 00:07:10,962
Bee-utiful.

181
00:07:10,965 --> 00:07:15,868
And whom do I thank for
my mysterious invitation?

182
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:20,439
Wait, I got an anonymous offer too.

183
00:07:20,441 --> 00:07:21,573
This wasn't your job?

184
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:23,142
I thought this was your job.

185
00:07:23,144 --> 00:07:25,671
Actually, I invited you.

186
00:07:30,411 --> 00:07:32,561
You want us to work for you?

187
00:07:32,564 --> 00:07:35,231
Not for me. With me.

188
00:07:35,234 --> 00:07:37,616
One big score split four ways.

189
00:07:37,619 --> 00:07:39,586
What's the catch, goody two shoes?

190
00:07:39,588 --> 00:07:43,690
No catches, no tricks.
Just one condition.

191
00:07:43,692 --> 00:07:45,058
No killing.

192
00:07:46,561 --> 00:07:48,895
Well, this has been
really fun, guys, I'm out.

193
00:07:48,897 --> 00:07:51,230
If anybody dies, the
cops will be all over us.

194
00:07:51,233 --> 00:07:53,155
Yeah, you would love that, huh?

195
00:07:53,158 --> 00:07:55,335
I was surprised that the
Flash isn't already here.

196
00:07:55,337 --> 00:07:56,770
I'm not working with him anymore.

197
00:07:56,772 --> 00:07:58,171
Look, you can put on your leather

198
00:07:58,173 --> 00:08:00,105
and you can act like a
bad girl all you want,

199
00:08:00,108 --> 00:08:01,841
but you will never be one of us.

200
00:08:01,843 --> 00:08:03,655
What about the ice patch?

201
00:08:03,658 --> 00:08:04,757
If you don't trust me,

202
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,025
why did you stop that test car

203
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:08,116
from running me over?

204
00:08:08,119 --> 00:08:09,885
Is she for real?

205
00:08:09,888 --> 00:08:11,955
It was cold.

206
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,118
Water freezes.

207
00:08:13,121 --> 00:08:15,321
Not like that, it doesn't.

208
00:08:15,323 --> 00:08:19,693
Look, these past few months,
I have been through a lot.

209
00:08:19,695 --> 00:08:21,561
I'm not the same person I was.

210
00:08:23,265 --> 00:08:25,632
Okay. Prove it.

211
00:08:25,635 --> 00:08:27,633
What's the job?

212
00:08:30,806 --> 00:08:32,254
McCulloch Technologies.

213
00:08:32,257 --> 00:08:33,608
It's the largest manufacturer

214
00:08:33,611 --> 00:08:35,796
of military-grade
weapons in the country.

215
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,744
So why does a speedster need our help

216
00:08:37,746 --> 00:08:39,679
to pull off a smash-and-grab?

217
00:08:39,681 --> 00:08:42,324
McCulloch builds and tests
all of their weapons here.

218
00:08:42,327 --> 00:08:43,750
The Forge.

219
00:08:43,752 --> 00:08:45,518
And it's protected by
a meta-human dampener

220
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,793
that makes A.R.G.U.S.'s
look like a bug zapper.

221
00:08:47,796 --> 00:08:51,691
So, you need us for our tech,
because it won't be affected.

222
00:08:51,693 --> 00:08:53,727
McCulloch's hosting an expo tonight.

223
00:08:53,729 --> 00:08:55,495
That'll give us cover
to get on the property,

224
00:08:55,497 --> 00:08:58,932
but breaking into the Forge
is where things get tricky.

225
00:08:58,934 --> 00:09:01,134
There's no way this
score is worth the risk.

226
00:09:01,136 --> 00:09:03,476
Look. See these weapons?

227
00:09:03,479 --> 00:09:05,846
There's a hundred
more like these inside.

228
00:09:05,849 --> 00:09:09,108
Each will go for a million
on the black market, easy.

229
00:09:09,111 --> 00:09:13,246
We just need to make
one quick pit stop first.

230
00:09:13,248 --> 00:09:15,782
We need to rob the Flash.

231
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:23,627
Okay, pretty safe
bet She-Cada was here.

232
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,726
Better check it out.

233
00:09:24,729 --> 00:09:26,762
See if we can figure out what she took.

234
00:09:26,765 --> 00:09:30,163
Yeah, that is if I can get my
fingers to start moving again.

235
00:09:30,165 --> 00:09:31,382
Whew.

236
00:09:31,385 --> 00:09:34,453
You think there's any chance
Frost could help us out

237
00:09:34,456 --> 00:09:36,589
with some sealant up there?

238
00:09:36,592 --> 00:09:39,426
I don't think she's coming out today.

239
00:09:39,429 --> 00:09:41,975
She still having a tough
time with your dad's death?

240
00:09:41,977 --> 00:09:44,110
I mean, Frost protected me for so long

241
00:09:44,112 --> 00:09:46,933
that I don't think she's ever
felt pain of her own before,

242
00:09:46,936 --> 00:09:48,124
not like this.

243
00:09:48,127 --> 00:09:50,628
Well, I-I think I could help with that.

244
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,300
Here.

245
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:58,071
"Ralph's 27 Steps to a Better Mourning"?

246
00:09:58,074 --> 00:09:59,541
I don't think Frost would respond

247
00:09:59,544 --> 00:10:01,110
very well to a pamphlet.

248
00:10:01,113 --> 00:10:02,412
Oh, come on. Look.

249
00:10:02,415 --> 00:10:04,936
Uh, number 10: go see
your dentist because

250
00:10:04,939 --> 00:10:06,533
you should be doing that
at least twice a year

251
00:10:06,535 --> 00:10:07,700
and you've been slacking,

252
00:10:07,702 --> 00:10:08,835
and it'll give you something to do

253
00:10:08,837 --> 00:10:10,603
other than dwell on the pain.

254
00:10:13,408 --> 00:10:16,676
There. Now will you shut up?

255
00:10:20,782 --> 00:10:23,516
Told you I'd get her to come out.

256
00:10:23,518 --> 00:10:24,882
Guess what?

257
00:10:24,885 --> 00:10:27,219
G. Simone & Associates
has spent the last year

258
00:10:27,222 --> 00:10:29,371
working for McCulloch Technologies.

259
00:10:29,374 --> 00:10:30,473
The weapons manufacturer?

260
00:10:30,476 --> 00:10:31,391
- Mm-hmm.
- Hmm.

261
00:10:31,393 --> 00:10:33,304
They just built a factory in Keystone.

262
00:10:33,307 --> 00:10:36,575
Missing blueprints. Top-secret facility.

263
00:10:38,314 --> 00:10:40,532
I think we might have
a heist on our hands.

264
00:10:40,535 --> 00:10:42,413
You think Nora's going
after these weapons?

265
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:44,336
No, maybe she's just trying
to get them off the market.

266
00:10:44,338 --> 00:10:46,136
You know, like the time
that Barry and Ralph

267
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:48,746
were gonna buy the Toastmasters.

268
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:50,477
She's on a mission for Thawne.

269
00:10:50,479 --> 00:10:52,746
He doesn't think that small.

270
00:10:52,749 --> 00:10:56,449
Hey, Barry is scanning
for negative tachyons.

271
00:10:56,452 --> 00:10:57,574
Why don't you and I dig

272
00:10:57,577 --> 00:10:59,953
into what kind of weapons
McCulloch is making?

273
00:10:59,955 --> 00:11:01,721
I know this whistleblower
down at the DOD.

274
00:11:01,723 --> 00:11:03,246
Maybe she could offer some insight.

275
00:11:03,249 --> 00:11:06,226
Uh...

276
00:11:06,228 --> 00:11:09,529
Iris, are you sure
there isn't anything else

277
00:11:09,531 --> 00:11:12,766
you'd like to talk about?

278
00:11:14,436 --> 00:11:18,238
Look... when I saw Nora in 2049,

279
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,041
she was so upset and so angry,

280
00:11:21,043 --> 00:11:24,744
but she knew that I
wanted to bring her back.

281
00:11:24,746 --> 00:11:26,046
Then she comes back to this time

282
00:11:26,048 --> 00:11:28,048
and... and she doesn't even come home?

283
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:29,649
I mean, even if she's mad at Barry

284
00:11:29,651 --> 00:11:32,819
or she wanted some
kind of sci-fi weapon...

285
00:11:32,821 --> 00:11:38,224
Then why didn't she just come
to the rest of us for help?

286
00:11:38,226 --> 00:11:41,294
There's gotta be a good reason.

287
00:11:41,296 --> 00:11:43,463
I know it.

288
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:47,367
Come on, Nora.

289
00:11:47,369 --> 00:11:51,104
She's avoiding us. She's
stealing blueprints.

290
00:11:51,106 --> 00:11:53,506
I mean, she could really
get into trouble out there.

291
00:11:53,508 --> 00:11:55,832
But you think she'll
return if you do find her?

292
00:11:55,835 --> 00:11:58,344
After all, she has good reason
to be angry at all of us.

293
00:11:58,346 --> 00:12:00,680
Uh, what? Don't lump me in with you two.

294
00:12:00,682 --> 00:12:02,082
I was pissed. She was pissed.

295
00:12:02,084 --> 00:12:05,513
But we've both had
time to... get over it,

296
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:06,848
and she's still Nora.

297
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,354
If I tell her she can come home again,

298
00:12:08,356 --> 00:12:10,348
I'm sure she'll stop
working with Thawne.

299
00:12:12,427 --> 00:12:13,593
Is that Nora?

300
00:12:13,595 --> 00:12:14,694
It has to be.

301
00:12:14,696 --> 00:12:16,329
She's in the Starchives.

302
00:12:24,206 --> 00:12:26,306
Nora.

303
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,313
Hi, Dad.

304
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:37,016
Hey, where you going?

305
00:12:37,018 --> 00:12:39,152
Nora is my responsibility as well.

306
00:12:39,154 --> 00:12:41,020
I must speak with her.

307
00:12:41,022 --> 00:12:42,272
Hey, hold that!

308
00:12:46,081 --> 00:12:47,480
One of our motion sensors

309
00:12:47,483 --> 00:12:49,763
just got tripped in the sewage system.

310
00:12:49,765 --> 00:12:51,197
Sewage system?

311
00:12:51,199 --> 00:12:53,199
Mais non. Nobody could fit down there.

312
00:13:03,578 --> 00:13:05,845
Is that Spencer Young's phone?

313
00:13:05,847 --> 00:13:09,215
What are you doing?

314
00:13:09,217 --> 00:13:12,318
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

315
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,355
Nora...

316
00:13:15,357 --> 00:13:20,160
I shouldn't have left
things the way that I did.

317
00:13:20,162 --> 00:13:21,694
All right?

318
00:13:23,064 --> 00:13:26,199
I want you to come home.

319
00:13:26,201 --> 00:13:28,835
We all do.

320
00:13:28,837 --> 00:13:32,138
You just have to stop
working with Thawne.

321
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:35,041
Target acquired.

322
00:13:35,043 --> 00:13:37,110
Copy that.

323
00:13:37,112 --> 00:13:40,647
Are you talking to someone?

324
00:13:42,417 --> 00:13:44,951
What do you think,
I'm talking to Thawne?

325
00:13:44,953 --> 00:13:47,253
He's in the future, Dad. I
can't exactly call him up.

326
00:13:47,256 --> 00:13:48,258
I didn't say that.

327
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:49,766
Yeah, but you did say
that I couldn't come home

328
00:13:49,768 --> 00:13:52,290
if I was still working with him.

329
00:13:52,293 --> 00:13:55,267
- You still don't trust me.
- Nora, trust takes time.

330
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:57,504
Then what's to stop
you from sending me back

331
00:13:57,507 --> 00:13:59,899
the next time you get pissed at me?

332
00:13:59,901 --> 00:14:01,434
Nothing.

333
00:14:01,436 --> 00:14:04,304
Because you've given up on me again.

334
00:14:04,306 --> 00:14:08,741
Given up on me like you do every time!

335
00:14:08,743 --> 00:14:10,043
Nora, what are you doing?

336
00:14:10,045 --> 00:14:13,313
You know, I came back here to meet you.

337
00:14:13,315 --> 00:14:16,410
And the second I got here,
you started pushing me away.

338
00:14:16,413 --> 00:14:18,685
And then you left me in the future.

339
00:14:18,687 --> 00:14:20,753
You just dumped me in
the middle of the street

340
00:14:20,755 --> 00:14:22,121
and walked away!

341
00:14:22,123 --> 00:14:23,155
You have to stop.

342
00:14:23,158 --> 00:14:25,058
And you didn't come with
Mom to bring me back.

343
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:29,095
Because you don't want me
here. You don't want me at all!

344
00:14:29,097 --> 00:14:30,530
- Nora, please!
- I hate you!

345
00:14:41,243 --> 00:14:43,077
Nora broke into the Starchives.

346
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:45,112
I'm sorry, what happened?

347
00:14:45,114 --> 00:14:47,281
Nora broke into the Starchives.

348
00:14:47,283 --> 00:14:49,550
I thought I could stop
her, but I couldn't.

349
00:14:49,552 --> 00:14:51,004
She stole Spencer Young's phone.

350
00:14:51,007 --> 00:14:52,902
Spencer Young's hypnotizing phone?

351
00:14:52,905 --> 00:14:54,735
- Yes.
- Barry, it's okay.

352
00:14:54,738 --> 00:14:56,605
Did you at least find
out what she's doing?

353
00:14:56,608 --> 00:14:57,858
No, no. I tried.

354
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,561
I-I thought I could
convince her to come home.

355
00:15:00,563 --> 00:15:01,929
But...

356
00:15:01,931 --> 00:15:04,598
her face started vibrating, and...

357
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,967
and then her eyes...

358
00:15:06,969 --> 00:15:09,436
her lightning...

359
00:15:09,438 --> 00:15:11,538
it was red.

360
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,140
Just like his.

361
00:15:13,142 --> 00:15:15,052
I thought we had time to reach her,

362
00:15:15,055 --> 00:15:15,988
but he got to her.

363
00:15:15,991 --> 00:15:17,574
Thawne really got to her.

364
00:15:17,577 --> 00:15:18,912
Uh, guys,

365
00:15:18,914 --> 00:15:22,116
there's a blinky red light
thing on the computer.

366
00:15:22,118 --> 00:15:25,786
Another alarm went off at S.T.A.R. Labs.

367
00:15:25,788 --> 00:15:27,688
Guys, this was only five minutes ago.

368
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:29,623
Joss Jackam and Peter Merkel?

369
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:31,324
How would they get into S.T.A.R. Labs?

370
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:33,093
Nora had someone in her ear.

371
00:15:33,095 --> 00:15:36,196
It was a coordinated assault.

372
00:15:36,198 --> 00:15:38,999
But that would mean
that she's working...

373
00:15:39,001 --> 00:15:40,067
with them.

374
00:15:47,209 --> 00:15:48,709
Barium.

375
00:15:48,711 --> 00:15:50,344
We're in Keystone City.

376
00:15:50,346 --> 00:15:53,046
Well, we got a Rag Doll,

377
00:15:53,048 --> 00:15:55,849
a Weather Witch, and, uh...

378
00:15:55,851 --> 00:15:58,452
hold up, is that crazy bee girl?

379
00:15:58,454 --> 00:16:00,921
Hey, girl! What's going on?

380
00:16:00,923 --> 00:16:02,856
What a throwback.

381
00:16:02,858 --> 00:16:04,691
What the hell is he doing here?

382
00:16:04,693 --> 00:16:06,660
What the hell are you doing here?

383
00:16:06,662 --> 00:16:08,462
Oh, no.

384
00:16:08,464 --> 00:16:09,863
She's with them.

385
00:16:09,865 --> 00:16:12,232
I said I wanted Ramon. No one else.

386
00:16:12,234 --> 00:16:13,434
Yeah, well, they were together,

387
00:16:13,436 --> 00:16:15,869
and you said no killing,
so here they are.

388
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:17,304
Killing?

389
00:16:17,306 --> 00:16:19,832
This phone was synced
to Spencer Young's DNA.

390
00:16:19,835 --> 00:16:22,242
We need you to hack past the
coding so we're able to use it.

391
00:16:23,512 --> 00:16:25,179
Why are you laughing?

392
00:16:25,181 --> 00:16:26,547
I'm sorry, I don't mean to blow up

393
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:28,668
your spot, fangirl, you
see, it's just, um...

394
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:31,793
I've done this exact same thing before.

395
00:16:31,796 --> 00:16:35,222
We need to hack a weapon.
Let's kidnap Cisco.

396
00:16:35,224 --> 00:16:38,355
I mean, what, did you join a
Rogues cover band or something?

397
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,799
How's this for a cover band?

398
00:16:50,506 --> 00:16:52,840
Oldie but a goodie.

399
00:16:52,842 --> 00:16:57,110
Look, XS, I owe you an apology, hmm?

400
00:16:57,112 --> 00:16:59,313
Never should've exposed
your secret the way I did.

401
00:16:59,315 --> 00:17:02,449
I put my pride in front of
the family that took me in...

402
00:17:02,451 --> 00:17:05,586
Your family... And
your family loves you.

403
00:17:05,588 --> 00:17:07,196
I'm sure you heard.

404
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,176
Your father told you
as much today, right?

405
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:11,022
You saw your father?

406
00:17:11,025 --> 00:17:13,325
You said you were robbing the Flash.

407
00:17:13,328 --> 00:17:16,329
No. No, don't you get it?

408
00:17:16,332 --> 00:17:18,165
Her old man is the Flash.

409
00:17:20,601 --> 00:17:23,746
Look, you don't have to
worry about the Flash, okay?

410
00:17:23,749 --> 00:17:26,473
Just get Ramon started on that phone.

411
00:17:30,713 --> 00:17:32,279
Hey.

412
00:17:32,281 --> 00:17:34,681
Boot scuff marks.

413
00:17:34,683 --> 00:17:36,316
I'm thinking she hit this thing.

414
00:17:36,318 --> 00:17:39,286
Yeah.

415
00:17:39,288 --> 00:17:41,421
Intravenous electrolytes.

416
00:17:41,423 --> 00:17:44,051
I mean, those can be used
to treat coma patients.

417
00:17:44,054 --> 00:17:46,393
So maybe she grabbed
them for Grace Junior.

418
00:17:46,395 --> 00:17:47,961
Hell, yeah.

419
00:17:47,963 --> 00:17:51,865
I knew your "Grey's Anatomy"
thing would come in handy.

420
00:17:51,867 --> 00:17:54,468
Ralph, why did you really bring me here?

421
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:57,104
Was it to help Killer Frost and me?

422
00:17:57,106 --> 00:17:59,806
The same way you helped
Cisco get over Gypsy

423
00:17:59,808 --> 00:18:02,910
and Sherloque with Renée?

424
00:18:02,912 --> 00:18:05,610
What are you talking
about? I mean, we're a team.

425
00:18:05,613 --> 00:18:07,079
It's what we do. We help each other.

426
00:18:07,082 --> 00:18:09,082
Yeah, but the minute you
got the Book of Ralph back

427
00:18:09,085 --> 00:18:11,818
from Cisco, you tried
to give it away again.

428
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,324
Don't you want to use it?

429
00:18:13,327 --> 00:18:15,722
Try and find someone
special for yourself?

430
00:18:18,093 --> 00:18:20,227
Caitlin...

431
00:18:20,229 --> 00:18:21,862
look...

432
00:18:21,864 --> 00:18:24,064
Book of Ralph...

433
00:18:24,066 --> 00:18:27,401
works great for other people, but...

434
00:18:27,403 --> 00:18:31,071
never actually worked for me.

435
00:18:31,073 --> 00:18:34,575
I know I'm not...

436
00:18:34,577 --> 00:18:36,977
built for love.

437
00:18:38,647 --> 00:18:40,847
And that's okay.

438
00:18:42,351 --> 00:18:48,055
Ralph Dibny, you are kind,
intelligent, and compassionate.

439
00:18:48,057 --> 00:18:49,389
And most of all,

440
00:18:49,391 --> 00:18:52,826
you put the needs of
others before yourself.

441
00:18:52,828 --> 00:18:56,530
So that means you are built for love,

442
00:18:56,532 --> 00:18:59,533
and you deserve someone
who loves you back.

443
00:19:04,506 --> 00:19:07,407
Caitlin...

444
00:19:09,712 --> 00:19:12,223
I'm sorry, I just don't
feel that way about you.

445
00:19:12,226 --> 00:19:14,324
Ugh. Gross!

446
00:19:14,327 --> 00:19:15,849
Oh, come on, you idiot.

447
00:19:15,851 --> 00:19:17,751
Sorry, I got my... I
got my wires crossed.

448
00:19:17,753 --> 00:19:19,953
Jeez.

449
00:19:19,955 --> 00:19:23,123
Hey...

450
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:25,626
I think this might be the fridge

451
00:19:25,628 --> 00:19:27,027
that Cisco was telling me about,

452
00:19:27,029 --> 00:19:31,231
the one that he rewired as an incubator.

453
00:19:31,233 --> 00:19:33,033
And now the top shelf is empty.

454
00:19:33,035 --> 00:19:34,968
Okay, what was on the top shelf?

455
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:38,839
Cisco's prototypes for
the meta-human cure.

456
00:19:40,509 --> 00:19:44,478
I think I know what Cicada is planning.

457
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,446
Last time a group of women

458
00:19:46,448 --> 00:19:47,948
had me tied up like this...

459
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:50,017
They were your ex-wives?

460
00:19:50,019 --> 00:19:51,852
No, their attorneys, actually.

461
00:19:51,854 --> 00:19:53,720
Am I gonna end up like you?

462
00:19:53,722 --> 00:19:55,155
Married to the job?

463
00:19:55,157 --> 00:19:57,207
Keeping secrets from everyone I know?

464
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:59,059
Well, actually, in my current romance,

465
00:19:59,061 --> 00:20:00,494
I'm not the one keeping secrets.

466
00:20:00,496 --> 00:20:02,429
No, no, I meet Renée Aldler...

467
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:05,532
- Adler...
- And then I discover...

468
00:20:05,534 --> 00:20:09,536
she's a meta-human.

469
00:20:09,538 --> 00:20:11,129
And she hasn't told you yet?

470
00:20:11,132 --> 00:20:13,051
No, monsieur. Can you believe that?

471
00:20:13,054 --> 00:20:15,777
So if you know the truth,
and you're bottling it in,

472
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:19,980
doesn't that mean you're
kind of being dishonest?

473
00:20:21,684 --> 00:20:23,583
Chicken recognize chicken.

474
00:20:23,585 --> 00:20:24,785
Hmm.

475
00:20:24,787 --> 00:20:26,687
And yet, are you really a chicken...

476
00:20:26,689 --> 00:20:28,221
Monsieur Bawk?

477
00:20:28,223 --> 00:20:31,725
Or are you not sharing your
secret identity with Kamala...

478
00:20:31,727 --> 00:20:33,560
- Kamilla.
- Because...

479
00:20:33,562 --> 00:20:37,497
you're not super-satisfied
with your secret identity?

480
00:20:39,568 --> 00:20:41,879
Are you saying I don't want to be Vibe?

481
00:20:41,882 --> 00:20:44,471
Well, let's examine
the evidence, shall we?

482
00:20:44,473 --> 00:20:47,541
You spent this past year sans
powers for the first part,

483
00:20:47,543 --> 00:20:50,143
and the second part curing powers.

484
00:20:50,145 --> 00:20:52,079
Perhaps being honest with Kamala...

485
00:20:52,081 --> 00:20:53,246
Kamilla.

486
00:20:53,249 --> 00:20:55,043
Begins with being honest with yourself.

487
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:56,616
Think about that.

488
00:21:00,089 --> 00:21:02,489
So what we know is that
Nora put together a team

489
00:21:02,491 --> 00:21:06,358
to break into here,
McCulloch Technologies,

490
00:21:06,361 --> 00:21:07,694
a weapons manufacturer.

491
00:21:07,696 --> 00:21:10,328
But not just any weapons.

492
00:21:10,331 --> 00:21:12,164
The city has contracted
these guys to clean up

493
00:21:12,167 --> 00:21:14,034
the shrapnel from the
S.T.A.R. Labs satellite.

494
00:21:14,037 --> 00:21:15,270
Let me guess: none of that crap

495
00:21:15,272 --> 00:21:16,570
ended up in the dump.

496
00:21:16,572 --> 00:21:19,754
They used it to make meta-tech
like Spencer Young's phone.

497
00:21:19,757 --> 00:21:22,042
My source says that
McCulloch is debuting

498
00:21:22,044 --> 00:21:25,066
a new line of products tonight.

499
00:21:25,069 --> 00:21:27,948
That's a perfect cover-up for a break-in.

500
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:29,957
We have any theory on Nora's motive?

501
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,619
Actually, Cicada's dagger
dampens the abilities

502
00:21:32,621 --> 00:21:34,154
of meta-humans nearby,

503
00:21:34,156 --> 00:21:36,523
but it wouldn't have
any effect on meta-tech.

504
00:21:36,525 --> 00:21:40,113
So maybe Nora wants to catch Cicada?

505
00:21:40,116 --> 00:21:42,128
Or do something worse.

506
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:44,304
Barry, there's no way.

507
00:21:44,307 --> 00:21:47,099
This is exactly what
I was afraid of, Iris.

508
00:21:47,102 --> 00:21:48,802
Thawne's been manipulating her.

509
00:21:48,804 --> 00:21:51,271
Now she's acting like
him, talking like him.

510
00:21:51,273 --> 00:21:53,506
That doesn't mean that she's
capable of killing Cicada.

511
00:21:53,508 --> 00:21:55,041
She's working with Rogues.

512
00:21:55,043 --> 00:21:56,676
She kidnapped Cisco and Sherloque.

513
00:21:56,678 --> 00:21:59,012
We don't know what she's capable of.

514
00:21:59,014 --> 00:22:00,968
So what do you want to do, Barr?

515
00:22:00,971 --> 00:22:02,282
We bring her in.

516
00:22:02,284 --> 00:22:03,683
We use Cisco's force fields,

517
00:22:03,685 --> 00:22:05,619
Ray's nanites... We're bringing her in,

518
00:22:05,621 --> 00:22:08,355
before she steps anywhere
near that building.

519
00:22:08,357 --> 00:22:10,790
Hey, Barry. Hold on.

520
00:22:10,792 --> 00:22:12,559
Hey.

521
00:22:12,561 --> 00:22:14,262
We can't keep treating Nora

522
00:22:14,265 --> 00:22:15,586
like she's some kind
of super-villain, okay?

523
00:22:15,588 --> 00:22:16,755
We're just gonna push her away.

524
00:22:16,757 --> 00:22:17,797
What are we supposed to do?

525
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:19,512
Just let her keep
taking advantage of us?

526
00:22:19,515 --> 00:22:21,601
No. We see where she's coming from.

527
00:22:21,603 --> 00:22:23,418
We try to figure out
why she's doing this.

528
00:22:23,421 --> 00:22:25,338
It doesn't matter why, Iris!

529
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,640
This is Thawne.

530
00:22:26,642 --> 00:22:27,965
It's his plan.

531
00:22:27,968 --> 00:22:30,310
Well, maybe his plan isn't so bad.

532
00:22:32,525 --> 00:22:33,780
What?

533
00:22:35,416 --> 00:22:36,683
Maybe...

534
00:22:36,685 --> 00:22:37,984
I thought...

535
00:22:37,986 --> 00:22:40,453
I thought we were past this, it's...

536
00:22:40,455 --> 00:22:44,591
It's not okay for her
to work with Thawne.

537
00:22:44,593 --> 00:22:46,793
You saw him. You said
he's manipulating her.

538
00:22:46,795 --> 00:22:48,457
And I said that he cares about her.

539
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,700
He's worried about her safety...

540
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:52,035
No, he needs her, Iris. He needs her.

541
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:55,268
Or... he's changed.

542
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:59,051
Barry, Thawne is the one that
convinced me to come back home

543
00:22:59,054 --> 00:23:02,676
and try and patch things up with you.

544
00:23:02,678 --> 00:23:04,945
Thawne.

545
00:23:04,947 --> 00:23:06,613
Thawne gave you advice?

546
00:23:08,483 --> 00:23:11,051
Look, I know it sounds insane,

547
00:23:11,053 --> 00:23:14,421
and I know this must
be hard for you to hear,

548
00:23:14,423 --> 00:23:16,256
but, Barry, ever since I got back home,

549
00:23:16,258 --> 00:23:19,793
the same question keeps
running through my mind.

550
00:23:19,795 --> 00:23:22,028
What if Nora is right?

551
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:24,564
What if Thawne really is
trying to redeem himself

552
00:23:24,566 --> 00:23:26,170
and that he does want to stop Cicada

553
00:23:26,173 --> 00:23:28,238
and the only reason that
Nora hasn't come back home

554
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:32,539
is because she knows
that you don't trust her?

555
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:34,140
Look...

556
00:23:34,143 --> 00:23:36,926
Barry, having Nora in our lives

557
00:23:36,929 --> 00:23:39,713
has made us better people.

558
00:23:39,715 --> 00:23:41,514
Isn't it possible

559
00:23:41,516 --> 00:23:43,882
that she did the same thing to Thawne?

560
00:23:57,736 --> 00:23:59,803
Jenni Ognats?

561
00:23:59,806 --> 00:24:02,196
I thought the idea was
to not draw attention.

562
00:24:02,199 --> 00:24:03,932
Oh, what, so now that you
know my dad's the Flash,

563
00:24:03,934 --> 00:24:05,000
you don't trust me?

564
00:24:05,002 --> 00:24:07,169
Hey, you're the one
who doesn't trust us.

565
00:24:07,171 --> 00:24:08,971
Isn't that right...

566
00:24:08,973 --> 00:24:10,639
Nora?

567
00:24:10,641 --> 00:24:15,477
Yeah, your secret identity,
it's really not worth much.

568
00:24:26,023 --> 00:24:29,491
Feels like nothing about
me is worth much lately.

569
00:24:29,493 --> 00:24:31,994
My dad left me,

570
00:24:31,996 --> 00:24:36,965
after everything that I've
done to try and help him.

571
00:24:36,967 --> 00:24:39,601
You know what the most
embarrassing part is?

572
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:41,770
There's this tiny,
little, weak part of me

573
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:44,106
that still wants him to
walk through that door

574
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:45,874
and take me home.

575
00:24:52,082 --> 00:24:58,053
My dad left my mom
at the maternity ward.

576
00:24:58,055 --> 00:25:01,190
She couldn't look at
me without seeing him.

577
00:25:01,192 --> 00:25:03,425
She made sure I knew it too.

578
00:25:03,427 --> 00:25:06,528
So the day I turned 13, I ran.

579
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:07,996
I didn't leave town at first.

580
00:25:07,998 --> 00:25:11,567
I stayed under the overpass
with all the other runaways.

581
00:25:11,569 --> 00:25:14,603
And I thought for sure,

582
00:25:14,605 --> 00:25:17,539
one night, I'd look up

583
00:25:17,541 --> 00:25:19,975
and I'd see my mom.

584
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:22,978
She never showed.

585
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,347
- Sorry.
- I'm not.

586
00:25:25,349 --> 00:25:27,182
When people tell you that

587
00:25:27,184 --> 00:25:30,219
family is always gonna be there for you,

588
00:25:30,221 --> 00:25:32,955
they're full of it.

589
00:25:32,957 --> 00:25:35,857
Mentors will always
let you down eventually.

590
00:25:35,859 --> 00:25:38,727
Parents will break you.

591
00:25:38,729 --> 00:25:39,928
Yeah.

592
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:42,364
That's why we have to stick together.

593
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:45,534
- Yeah.
- Hey, it's done.

594
00:25:45,536 --> 00:25:47,836
Come on. Nerd's done with the phone.

595
00:25:52,142 --> 00:25:55,177
One reprogrammed meta-tech phone,

596
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:58,947
now with visual and auditory
hypnosis capabilities.

597
00:26:00,485 --> 00:26:02,352
Plus unlimited data.

598
00:26:05,789 --> 00:26:07,269
You gonna let us go now?

599
00:26:07,272 --> 00:26:09,335
What, so you can run
right back to the Flash?

600
00:26:09,338 --> 00:26:12,094
How stupid do you think I am?

601
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:13,644
Any bugs in there?

602
00:26:13,647 --> 00:26:15,230
- It's clean.
- Good.

603
00:26:15,232 --> 00:26:18,066
Now make sure they
can't try anything else.

604
00:26:28,812 --> 00:26:29,978
Come on.

605
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:32,281
This score's not gonna steal itself.

606
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:43,258
You're not gonna get away with this.

607
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:43,976
Hey.

608
00:26:43,979 --> 00:26:45,343
I'm not gonna get away with it?

609
00:26:45,346 --> 00:26:47,546
Cisco's old speedster trap.

610
00:26:47,549 --> 00:26:49,831
You think that's gonna work for Nora?

611
00:26:49,833 --> 00:26:51,400
I don't know.

612
00:26:51,402 --> 00:26:55,069
I'm not sure I'm ready
to find out, though.

613
00:26:55,072 --> 00:26:57,606
Hey, look, I'm sorry about, um...

614
00:26:57,608 --> 00:27:00,809
how I was acting earlier, I just...

615
00:27:00,811 --> 00:27:03,230
seeing Nora looking so much like him...

616
00:27:03,233 --> 00:27:05,314
No, I get it, Barr.

617
00:27:05,316 --> 00:27:07,549
That guy's always gonna be in your head.

618
00:27:07,551 --> 00:27:09,518
Mine too.

619
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,053
And you were right.

620
00:27:11,055 --> 00:27:12,788
Nora broke the law.

621
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:15,691
And there should be
repercussions for that.

622
00:27:15,693 --> 00:27:19,861
But whenever you guys
step out of bounds,

623
00:27:19,863 --> 00:27:21,830
I always have to remind myself,

624
00:27:21,832 --> 00:27:25,300
the detective side says there's the law.

625
00:27:25,302 --> 00:27:29,438
But the father side says
there's also what's right.

626
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:35,510
And... I'm always gonna
choose to be your father first.

627
00:27:38,916 --> 00:27:40,376
Maybe that's my problem.

628
00:27:40,379 --> 00:27:41,678
What?

629
00:27:44,254 --> 00:27:47,356
I was ready to give up on her.

630
00:27:47,358 --> 00:27:50,559
You know, I mean, If
I'm ready to do that,

631
00:27:50,561 --> 00:27:52,427
it makes me feel like...

632
00:27:52,429 --> 00:27:54,796
even after everything
we've been through,

633
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:56,498
I'm not a good parent.

634
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,316
You know, I mean, maybe I never will be.

635
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:00,869
Come on, Barry. You
know that's not true.

636
00:28:00,871 --> 00:28:04,090
You're going to be an amazing father.

637
00:28:04,093 --> 00:28:06,508
I wanted her to leave.

638
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:10,612
The second that she
got here, I did, I...

639
00:28:10,614 --> 00:28:12,748
I've held back from her.

640
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:15,751
It still doesn't feel
right when she calls me Dad.

641
00:28:15,753 --> 00:28:19,988
Well, you didn't call me Dad till...

642
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:22,051
It was here, in this room,

643
00:28:22,054 --> 00:28:24,526
right after you got your powers.

644
00:28:24,528 --> 00:28:26,628
But you know why that was.

645
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:29,913
You already had a dad. Henry.

646
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:31,800
And when the whole world thought that

647
00:28:31,802 --> 00:28:35,036
that man was a criminal, Barr, you...

648
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:41,810
You thought he was perfect.

649
00:28:41,812 --> 00:28:44,613
Do you think Iris is right?

650
00:28:44,615 --> 00:28:48,850
Nora's plan, Thawne's plan...

651
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:50,352
could be a good thing?

652
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:52,721
I don't trust that man.

653
00:28:52,723 --> 00:28:55,424
I never have and I never will.

654
00:28:55,426 --> 00:28:57,659
But I do...

655
00:28:57,661 --> 00:29:00,662
trust my granddaughter.

656
00:29:00,664 --> 00:29:04,065
And if we're gonna
bring Nora home, Barr...

657
00:29:04,067 --> 00:29:06,568
you're gonna have to trust her too.

658
00:29:17,481 --> 00:29:19,014
Oh, thank Crom.

659
00:29:19,016 --> 00:29:20,549
I might've given you unlimited data,

660
00:29:20,551 --> 00:29:22,617
but I also gave you spotty reception.

661
00:29:22,619 --> 00:29:23,733
Nice work.

662
00:29:23,736 --> 00:29:25,454
All right. The bees are in drone mode.

663
00:29:25,456 --> 00:29:28,590
So if we move very, very slowly...

664
00:29:28,592 --> 00:29:30,392
Man, what in the world?

665
00:29:30,394 --> 00:29:31,626
What?

666
00:29:31,628 --> 00:29:33,028
I was trained in the art of escape

667
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,855
by Thaddeus Brown from Earth-51.

668
00:29:34,858 --> 00:29:36,441
Yeah, well, help me escape!

669
00:29:36,444 --> 00:29:38,300
That's a good plan.

670
00:29:38,302 --> 00:29:39,554
So, um...

671
00:29:39,557 --> 00:29:41,803
- Count backwards from ten.
- Ten...

672
00:29:41,805 --> 00:29:42,737
Ow!

673
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:43,944
How did you do that?

674
00:29:43,947 --> 00:29:45,273
- Trade secret.
- Okay.

675
00:29:46,777 --> 00:29:48,210
So...

676
00:29:48,212 --> 00:29:50,316
You're not fireproof,
are you, Monsieur Ramon?

677
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:51,847
Am I fire... Oh, God.

678
00:29:53,676 --> 00:29:54,942
Oh.

679
00:29:54,945 --> 00:29:56,611
Ah.

680
00:29:56,614 --> 00:29:57,986
No, no.

681
00:29:57,988 --> 00:29:59,354
Hey!

682
00:30:08,632 --> 00:30:09,798
That's all of them?

683
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,266
- I think so.
- Good.

684
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:13,473
Because Nora West-Allen
is in grave danger.

685
00:30:24,365 --> 00:30:26,683
Thank you for your patience,
ladies and gentlemen.

686
00:30:26,686 --> 00:30:29,351
With the kind of technology
we're displaying tonight,

687
00:30:29,353 --> 00:30:32,220
security is our highest priority.

688
00:30:32,222 --> 00:30:33,488
Visitor IDs, please.

689
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:35,156
You bet.

690
00:30:42,031 --> 00:30:44,804
Okay, here we go.
Right this way, ladies.

691
00:30:44,807 --> 00:30:46,401
The last ten months have been

692
00:30:46,403 --> 00:30:48,670
very exciting here at McCulloch.

693
00:30:48,672 --> 00:30:51,239
Buyers from the Army and Navy
are already waiting for us

694
00:30:51,241 --> 00:30:52,941
in our state-of-the-art demo room.

695
00:30:52,943 --> 00:30:56,011
Uh, what's behind that door?

696
00:30:56,013 --> 00:30:57,279
Ah.

697
00:30:57,281 --> 00:30:59,394
That's what our engineers
have dubbed the Forge.

698
00:30:59,397 --> 00:31:01,950
It's where we develop
and test our new weapons.

699
00:31:01,952 --> 00:31:04,619
Unfortunately, it's only
accessible to employees

700
00:31:04,621 --> 00:31:07,956
with the highest security clearance.

701
00:31:13,535 --> 00:31:15,035
Remember.

702
00:31:15,038 --> 00:31:16,371
No killing.

703
00:31:22,439 --> 00:31:25,540
That's a Montgomery
4000, 30-ton vault door.

704
00:31:25,542 --> 00:31:27,142
It'll only open from the inside,

705
00:31:27,144 --> 00:31:30,612
so the only way into the
Forge is through there.

706
00:31:55,439 --> 00:31:58,106
Mm, cozy.

707
00:31:58,108 --> 00:31:59,874
Ready, clown?

708
00:32:02,278 --> 00:32:04,912
Are you sure you can
fit through that thing?

709
00:32:06,483 --> 00:32:11,624
This shall be my aria.

710
00:32:11,627 --> 00:32:13,985
Remember, once you
get to the other side,

711
00:32:13,988 --> 00:32:15,988
the dampener will take away your powers,

712
00:32:15,991 --> 00:32:18,426
so get out quick.

713
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:28,670
Yeah, I'm gonna vomit.

714
00:32:32,776 --> 00:32:34,409
Mm, mm, mm...

715
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:43,284
Open, sesame.

716
00:32:45,489 --> 00:32:49,991
Stay with the hostages.
We'll grab you on the way out.

717
00:32:49,993 --> 00:32:52,627
See you soon.

718
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:02,537
That's one serious meta-dampener.

719
00:33:05,342 --> 00:33:07,008
Whoa.

720
00:33:12,549 --> 00:33:14,616
Last part of the plan.

721
00:33:14,618 --> 00:33:17,252
Load up.

722
00:33:17,254 --> 00:33:19,754
Sorry, XS.

723
00:33:21,825 --> 00:33:23,525
Change of plans.

724
00:33:28,814 --> 00:33:31,203
Good evening, Central City.

725
00:33:31,206 --> 00:33:33,094
We've prepared a special show for you.

726
00:33:33,097 --> 00:33:34,341
Tonight's festivities

727
00:33:34,343 --> 00:33:38,612
will feature several
expendable worker bees...

728
00:33:38,614 --> 00:33:43,416
The employees of McCulloch Technologies.

729
00:33:43,418 --> 00:33:45,685
Unless the Flash comes down
here in the next 30 seconds

730
00:33:45,687 --> 00:33:47,821
and reveals his identity to the world.

731
00:33:47,823 --> 00:33:48,922
Gucci?

732
00:33:50,526 --> 00:33:51,758
You don't want the money?

733
00:33:52,794 --> 00:33:54,394
Oh, no. We want the money.

734
00:33:54,396 --> 00:33:56,531
We just wanted to make a
name for ourselves first.

735
00:33:56,534 --> 00:34:00,567
So, what, outing my dad
makes you legitimate Rogues?

736
00:34:00,569 --> 00:34:01,668
I trusted you.

737
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:05,005
Oh, God.

738
00:34:05,007 --> 00:34:07,174
You sound just like Silver Ghost...

739
00:34:07,176 --> 00:34:09,976
when I left her in Bolivia.

740
00:34:09,978 --> 00:34:12,379
At least you'll die fast.

741
00:34:12,381 --> 00:34:14,581
I'd say it's been
about 30 seconds, right?

742
00:34:14,583 --> 00:34:16,483
- Yeah.
- Right?

743
00:34:16,485 --> 00:34:18,485
Okay.

744
00:34:18,487 --> 00:34:20,487
Wait!

745
00:34:23,325 --> 00:34:25,358
I am here.

746
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,127
All right, Speedy.

747
00:34:27,129 --> 00:34:29,394
Show us your true identity. Mask off.

748
00:34:29,397 --> 00:34:31,296
Dad, please. You do not have to do this.

749
00:34:31,299 --> 00:34:32,798
I have to.

750
00:34:32,801 --> 00:34:38,038
I am a man sitting alone
at the dinner table.

751
00:34:40,709 --> 00:34:41,975
Is he drunk?

752
00:34:41,977 --> 00:34:45,645
See, when you're in position

753
00:34:45,647 --> 00:34:48,515
to feed the world,

754
00:34:48,517 --> 00:34:51,017
it can make it hard to be a father.

755
00:34:51,019 --> 00:34:52,852
You have to constantly ask yourself,

756
00:34:52,855 --> 00:34:56,957
is what's right for the world
what's right for your child?

757
00:34:56,959 --> 00:34:58,305
Hey, can we get on with it?

758
00:34:58,308 --> 00:35:00,602
Yes, um... yeah, uh...

759
00:35:00,605 --> 00:35:02,247
- No.
- What?

760
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:05,016
Did you seriously think I
was gonna fall for this again?

761
00:35:09,838 --> 00:35:11,171
Ha!

762
00:35:11,173 --> 00:35:12,939
I phase right through your blast.

763
00:35:12,941 --> 00:35:14,586
Ha! You can't stop the Flash!

764
00:35:14,589 --> 00:35:16,910
No, I think the jig is up.

765
00:35:16,912 --> 00:35:18,612
Confused?

766
00:35:18,614 --> 00:35:19,879
Don't be.

767
00:35:24,753 --> 00:35:26,219
Holy shrap.

768
00:35:26,221 --> 00:35:27,821
How the hell is this even possible?

769
00:35:27,823 --> 00:35:28,855
We bypassed security

770
00:35:28,857 --> 00:35:30,757
while you were busy with General Cloud.

771
00:35:30,759 --> 00:35:32,875
And then you walked us
worker bees right inside.

772
00:35:32,878 --> 00:35:36,329
You're outnumbered,
ladies. Drop your weapons.

773
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,933
Don't let them hit that dampener.

774
00:35:39,935 --> 00:35:41,201
Get the hostages out of here.

775
00:35:41,203 --> 00:35:42,636
We'll handle the Rogues.

776
00:35:43,772 --> 00:35:45,338
Okay, this way.

777
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:50,910
- We gotta get back in there.
- Yeah.

778
00:35:52,848 --> 00:35:55,982
What the hell is that?

779
00:35:55,984 --> 00:35:57,784
You don't want to know.

780
00:36:08,997 --> 00:36:10,730
Cisco, we need our powers back.

781
00:36:10,732 --> 00:36:12,299
Can you do something about these bees?

782
00:36:12,301 --> 00:36:13,933
Hold tight.

783
00:36:13,935 --> 00:36:15,615
Iris!

784
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:33,887
All right, we're not gonna
last here much longer.

785
00:36:33,889 --> 00:36:34,954
I'm gonna create a diversion.

786
00:36:34,956 --> 00:36:36,242
Get ready to shoot the dampener.

787
00:36:36,245 --> 00:36:37,791
No, no. Dad, it's too dangerous!

788
00:36:39,161 --> 00:36:41,294
Dad!

789
00:36:47,969 --> 00:36:50,670
He's lucky I don't
throw his ass off a roof.

790
00:36:50,672 --> 00:36:52,205
Nobody out-techs me.

791
00:37:00,749 --> 00:37:02,688
Damn it. Ramon's in my phone.

792
00:37:02,691 --> 00:37:05,573
She's not getting out of this one alive.

793
00:37:05,576 --> 00:37:07,230
Nora, wait!

794
00:37:15,097 --> 00:37:16,329
Dad! You've been hit.

795
00:37:19,334 --> 00:37:22,869
Are you okay?

796
00:37:22,871 --> 00:37:25,038
Yeah.

797
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,240
I'm not the only one.

798
00:37:30,379 --> 00:37:32,212
You were here with me.

799
00:37:32,214 --> 00:37:33,613
The whole time.

800
00:37:33,615 --> 00:37:35,148
I abandoned you once.

801
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:37,183
I'm never gonna do it again.

802
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:41,254
So we should probably...

803
00:37:41,256 --> 00:37:43,016
Oh, yeah. Definitely.

804
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:56,746
The Young Rogues.

805
00:37:56,748 --> 00:37:58,774
Not the nicest friends
you made there, kiddo.

806
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:03,286
Yeah, I... thought I could control them,

807
00:38:03,288 --> 00:38:05,288
steal the weapons back
after we lifted them,

808
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:08,024
but I got in over my head.

809
00:38:08,026 --> 00:38:09,959
Even if it was for a good reason.

810
00:38:09,961 --> 00:38:12,729
Nora, killing Cicada
is not a good reason.

811
00:38:12,731 --> 00:38:15,198
No, I-I wasn't trying to kill Cicada.

812
00:38:22,707 --> 00:38:24,667
I needed this.

813
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:27,343
It's a weapon built from
the solar reflector panels

814
00:38:27,345 --> 00:38:29,188
from the S.T.A.R. Labs satellite,

815
00:38:29,191 --> 00:38:32,281
capable of destroying any
object down to its atoms,

816
00:38:32,283 --> 00:38:36,386
and it's the only thing that
can destroy Cicada's dagger.

817
00:38:38,556 --> 00:38:40,823
Nora, why didn't you just tell us this?

818
00:38:40,825 --> 00:38:43,493
Because I wouldn't have believed her.

819
00:38:43,495 --> 00:38:45,495
'Cause it's Thawne's plan.

820
00:38:45,497 --> 00:38:47,830
I knew how angry Dad was.

821
00:38:47,832 --> 00:38:51,034
And then you came to
the future without him.

822
00:38:51,036 --> 00:38:53,441
I just thought he'd never believe me.

823
00:38:53,444 --> 00:38:56,339
Plus, I had to stay in a
seriously unschway headspace

824
00:38:56,341 --> 00:39:00,243
to use the negative Speed Force.

825
00:39:00,245 --> 00:39:02,412
But I know now.

826
00:39:02,414 --> 00:39:04,714
I don't ever want to
leave you guys again.

827
00:39:04,716 --> 00:39:08,017
And if that means not following
through with Thawne's plan,

828
00:39:08,019 --> 00:39:10,086
I'm okay with that.

829
00:39:15,093 --> 00:39:17,326
I think we should use it.

830
00:39:17,328 --> 00:39:20,163
- You what?
- Barr, are you sure?

831
00:39:20,165 --> 00:39:21,597
We have to stop Cicada.

832
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:24,567
I'm never gonna like
where this plan comes from.

833
00:39:24,569 --> 00:39:27,570
But if this thing works...

834
00:39:27,572 --> 00:39:29,872
sounds like our best shot.

835
00:39:29,874 --> 00:39:32,942
You really believe him?

836
00:39:32,944 --> 00:39:35,945
I believe in you, Nora.

837
00:39:37,482 --> 00:39:41,684
And I'm sorry that I
made you feel otherwise.

838
00:39:41,686 --> 00:39:43,086
Dad...

839
00:39:43,088 --> 00:39:44,253
that stuff I said earlier...

840
00:39:44,255 --> 00:39:46,522
I deserved it.

841
00:39:46,524 --> 00:39:48,624
I-I...

842
00:39:48,626 --> 00:39:51,461
I shouldn't have left you in the future.

843
00:39:51,463 --> 00:39:55,965
I shouldn't have put
conditions on you coming home.

844
00:39:55,967 --> 00:39:58,034
I'm sorry.

845
00:39:58,036 --> 00:40:01,170
I love you.

846
00:40:03,074 --> 00:40:05,508
We both do.

847
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:08,344
We're never gonna leave you again, Nora.

848
00:40:08,346 --> 00:40:10,913
I promise.

849
00:40:18,523 --> 00:40:19,956
So what's the verdict?

850
00:40:19,958 --> 00:40:21,406
Nora's story checks out.

851
00:40:21,409 --> 00:40:23,593
This thing has got a prismatic battery

852
00:40:23,595 --> 00:40:25,628
supercharging its reflector panels.

853
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:28,064
So if anything's gonna
destroy that dagger,

854
00:40:28,066 --> 00:40:31,033
it's this mirror gun.

855
00:40:31,035 --> 00:40:32,768
That may be easier said than done.

856
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:33,878
Why's that?

857
00:40:33,881 --> 00:40:35,972
We figured out what Cicada
took from my dad's lab.

858
00:40:35,974 --> 00:40:38,141
It's your cure prototypes.

859
00:40:38,143 --> 00:40:40,292
Why would she need those?
They're just prototypes.

860
00:40:40,295 --> 00:40:41,828
No, they're not just prototypes.

861
00:40:41,831 --> 00:40:44,814
They're failed, broken
versions of the cure.

862
00:40:44,816 --> 00:40:47,583
If a meta-human takes that
without the proper treatment...

863
00:40:47,585 --> 00:40:49,352
They would die.

864
00:40:49,354 --> 00:40:51,854
Cicada has a lethal virus on her hands.

865
00:40:51,856 --> 00:40:53,356
That's why she stole the atomizer.

866
00:40:53,358 --> 00:40:54,891
So she can spread the virus.

867
00:40:54,893 --> 00:40:57,226
She has weaponized the cure.

868
00:40:57,228 --> 00:40:59,662
This is it.

869
00:40:59,664 --> 00:41:01,364
This is the nightmare.

870
00:41:01,366 --> 00:41:05,334
Cicada's gonna kill every
meta-human in the city.

871
00:41:16,748 --> 00:41:20,449
A rare, old bird is the pelican,

872
00:41:20,451 --> 00:41:26,756
whose beak can hold
more than his belly can.

873
00:41:26,758 --> 00:41:29,725
He can hold in his beak...

874
00:41:29,727 --> 00:41:33,396
enough food for a week.

875
00:41:33,398 --> 00:41:37,733
- But I'm...
- Darned...

876
00:41:37,735 --> 00:41:40,870
if I know...

877
00:41:40,872 --> 00:41:44,440
how the hell he can.

878
00:41:44,442 --> 00:41:49,534
