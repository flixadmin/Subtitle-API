00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,360
Yes.

647
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:36,040
And you will restore the heart!

648
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,560
All right. I'm out.

649
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,040
Oh, come on!

650
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:57,720
What is your problem?

651
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:01,240
Are you afraid of it?

652
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:02,880
No! No.

(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
I'm not afraid.

654

Stay out of it
or you're sleeping in my armpit.

655

You, stop it.

656
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:14,400
That is not a heart. It is a curse.

657
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,680
The second I took it,
I got blasted outta the sky...

658
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,040
and I lost my hook.

659
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,360
Get it away from me.

660
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,200
Get this away?

661
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,320
Hey, hey, hey! I'm a demigod, okay?

662
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:25,160
Stop that. I will smite you!

Listen, that thing doesn't give you
power to create life...

If you don't put it away,
bad things are gonna come for it.

668
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,360
Come for this? The heart?

669
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:39,600
You mean this heart right here?

670

Don't, you can't
raise your voice like that!

We'd never make it without my hook.
Not past Te Kā.

747
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:52,160
Then we get your hook.

748

We get your hook, take out Te Kā,
restore the heart.

it's that beady-eyed bottom-feeder.

And it's not just sails and knots...

767
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:02,360
it's seeing where you're going
in your mind.

-No.

<i>I'll never hide</i>
<i>I can't</i>

979
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:22,920
<i>I'm too shiny</i>

980
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:26,040
<i>Watch me dazzle</i>
<i>Like a diamond in the rough</i>

981
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:29,560
<i>Strut my stuff</i>
<i>My stuff is so shiny</i>

984
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:38,600
<i>You can try, try, try</i>
<i>But you can't expect a demigod</i>

985
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:41,600
<i>To beat a decapod</i>
<i>Look it up</i>

986
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:43,560
<i>You will die, die, die</i>

987
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,560
<i>Now it's time for me to take apart</i>

988
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:48,080
<i>Your achin' heart</i>

989
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:52,840
<i>Far from the ones who abandoned you</i>

990
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:57,720
<i>Chasing the love of these humans</i>

991
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:00,800
<i>Who made you feel wanted</i>

992
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:03,600
<i>You tried to be tough</i>

993
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:07,800
<i>But your armor's just not hard enough</i>

994
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:11,760
<i>Maui</i>
<i>Now it's time to kick your heinie</i>

995
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:15,560
<i>Ever seen someone so shiny</i>

996
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:18,840

01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:26,520
<i>Just for me</i>

01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:30,280
<i>You'll never be quite as shiny</i>

-Huh?

1004
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:40,960
I got something shiny for ya!

1005
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:45,480
The heart of Te Fiti.

1006
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:47,960
You can't run from me!

1007
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:50,160
Oh, you can. You keep surprising me.

1008
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:54,840
There's only so far you can get
on those two little legs.

01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,600
The power of creation...

1012
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:03,440
for a crustacean.

1013
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:05,080
Where is it? Where is it?

1014
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:07,320
We gotta go!

1015
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,000
What about the heart?

1016
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:11,680
He can have it. I've got a better one.

1017
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,320
Yes, I have the...

1018
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:15,480
Wait a minute.

1019
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:18,480
I see, she's taken a barnacle
and she's covered it in...

1020
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:21,840
bioluminescent algae as a diversion.

1021
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:25,200
Come back here!

1022
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:32,000
Cheeeehoooo!

1023
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:34,160
Hey!

1024
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:35,840

We're alive!

1028
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:48,880
Listen...

1029
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:50,960
I appreciate what you did down there.

1030
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:52,280
Mm-hmm.

1031
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:53,400
-Took guts.
-Mm-hmm.

1032
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:54,760
-But...
-Mm-hmm.

1033
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:55,920
I'm sorry.

1034
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:59,120
I'm trying to be sincere for once,
and it feels like you're distracted.

1035
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:01,200
No, no. No way!

1036
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:03,640
Really? Because you're looking at me
like I have a...

(GASPS)

1038
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:07,720
shark head.

1039
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:11,040
What? Do you have a shark head?

1040
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:12,920
Look, the point is...

1041
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:15,960
for a little girl, child, thing,
whatever...

1042
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:18,680
who had no business
being down there...

1043
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:20,600
you did me a solid.

1044
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:22,840
But you also almost died.

1045
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:25,080
And I couldn't even beat that dumb crab.

1046
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:27,400
So, chances of beating Te Kā?

1047
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:28,720
Bupkis.

1048
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:32,160
We're never making it to Te Fiti.
This mission is cursed.

1049
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:33,560
It's not cursed.

1050
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:35,280
Shark head.

1051
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:38,160
It is not cursed.

1052
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,000
(GROANS)

1053
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:53,360
Cursed.

1054
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:59,600
<i>What can I say except</i>

1055
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:01,600
<i>We're dead soon</i>

1056
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:03,280
<i>We're dead soon</i>

1057
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:06,240
Can you at least try?

1058
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:10,600
Giant hawk.

1059
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:15,560
<i>Hey, it's okay, it's okay</i>
<i>We're dead soon</i>

1060
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:18,360
All right, break time's over.

1061
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:19,520
Get up.

1062
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:22,040
Why? Are you gonna
give me a speech?

1063
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:25,960
Tell me I can beat Te Kā
'cause I'm "Maui?"

1064
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:28,800
Take a hike, Tiny.

1065
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:37,320
How do you get your tattoos?

1066
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:39,920
They show up. When I earn them.

1067
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:43,720
How'd you earn that one?
What's that for?

1068
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:47,200
That's man's discovery of Nunya.

1069
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:48,480
What's Nunya?

1070
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:50,000
Nunya business.

1071
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:52,960
I'll just keep asking.

1072
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:56,200
What's it for?

1073
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:59,000
You need to stop doing that.

1074
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:05,360
-Back off.
-Just tell me what it is.

1075
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:07,000
I said back off.

1076
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:08,840
Is it why your hook's not working?

1077
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:27,600
You don't wanna talk, don't talk.

1078
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:30,040
You wanna throw me off the boat...

1079
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:32,120
throw me off.

1080
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:35,600
You wanna tell me
I don't know what I'm doing...

1081
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:37,760
I know I don't.

1082
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:41,880
I have no idea why the ocean chose me.

1083
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:43,760
You're right.

1084
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:48,360
But my island is dying...

1085
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:52,200
so I am here.

1086
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:55,280
It's just me and you.

1087
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:58,080
And I want to help...

1088
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:02,560
but I can't if you don't let me.

1089
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:07,880
(SIGHS)

1090
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:10,480
MAUI: I wasn't born a demigod.

1091
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:13,280
I had human parents.

1092
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:19,600
They took one look and decided...

1093
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:22,240
they did not want me.

1094
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:24,720
They threw me into the sea...

1095
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:28,280
like I was nothing.

1096
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:33,280
Somehow, I was found by the gods.

1097
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:35,080
They gave me the hook.

1098
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:36,920
They made me...

1099
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:38,760
Maui.

1100
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:42,800
And back to the humans I went.

1101
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:47,160
I gave them islands, fire, coconuts.

1102
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:50,440
Anything they could ever want.

1103
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:53,440
You took the heart for them.

1104
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:57,040
You did everything for them.

1105
01:09:57,880 --> 01:09:59,680
So they'd love you.

1106
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:03,440
It was never enough.

1107
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:14,880
Maybe the gods found you for a reason.

1108
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:18,200
Maybe the ocean brought you to them...

1109
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:22,480
because it saw someone
who was worthy of being saved.

1110
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:27,320
But the gods aren't the ones
who make you Maui.

1111
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,240
You are.

1112
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:40,520
Okay, okay.

1113
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:44,000
I love you, too, buddy.

1114
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:35,040
Cheeeehoooo!

1115
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:50,960
Yeah!

1116
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:17,800
Next stop, Te Fiti.

1117
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:05,640
What?

1118
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:07,320
I figured it out.

1119
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:12,360
You know, the ocean used to love
when I pulled up islands...

1120
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:16,320
'cause your ancestors
would sail her seas and find 'em.

1121
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:19,920
All those new lands, new villages.

1122
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:22,760
It was the water that connected 'em all.

1123
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:24,800
And if I were the ocean...

1124
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:29,080
I think I'd be looking for
a curly-haired non-princess...

1125
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:31,680
to start that again.

1126
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:36,200
That is literally the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

1127
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:39,360
Probably should have saved it
for Te Fiti.

1128
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,080
I did.

1129
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:47,080
Moana of Motunui...

1130
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:52,880
I believe you have officially
delivered Maui across the great sea.

1131
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,520
Moana! Moana! Moana!

1132
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:58,760
You're so amazing!

1133
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:01,560
It's time.

1134
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:21,440
Go save the world.

1135
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:24,560
Cheeeehoooo!
