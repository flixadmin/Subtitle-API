you get out there

Where's Emiko?

Well, if I told you that,
Mr. Queen,

19
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,153
she'd have me head.
[Laughs]

That Virgil is
damn slippery.

26
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,996
At least now we know what
he's trying to acquire.

27
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,952
A.R.G.U.S. vault drive,

triple-level encryption
for eyes-only documents.

29
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,034
If someone at
the agency's leaking

30
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,376
classified intel to
The Ninth Circle...

31
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,776
right. But if we have
some indication

32
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,951
as to what they're
planning finally,

33
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,350
it might help me
find Emiko.

34
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,558
Dinah: And you said
you didn't need any backup.

35
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,869
Yeah. Well, we
lost Virgil,

36
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,394
but we got what
he was after.

37
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,600
This drive feels like our
best lead at finding Emiko,

38
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,920
at least
until Archer's back up.

39
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,553
Alena is pulling
all-nighters

40
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,696
to get Archer
back up and running,

41
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,599
and once it is, we will
be able to find Emiko.

42
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,640
And finally tell her that
Dante killed her mother.

43

Rene: And, hopefully,
she'll come to her senses

44

about The Ninth Circle.

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,416
Felicity: Well, that
would be enough for me

46
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,656
to turn myself against
the evil organization

47
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,080

- What's that? What's wrong?

50
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,696
Felicity: The drive has
a security failsafe

51
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,056
that fried all the files,
probably to prevent

52
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,480
someone like me
from trying to do

53
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,153
what I am trying to do.

54
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,960
But these aren't
A.R.G.U.S.-encrypted protocols.

55
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,176
Someone else must've written the
security program for this drive.

56
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,839
Wait. If it's not
A.R.G.U.S., who is it?

57
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,936
Well, I have hacked enough
government servers in my day

58
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,336
to know that this is the
department of defense.

59
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,376
Not that I do that anymore,
because I work with the SCPD.

60
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,720
But this branch is
the D.I.A.

61
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,976
What would
The Ninth Circle want

62
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,440
with the defense
intelligence agency?

63
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,480
We need to find out.

64
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,096
You're married to
the A.R.G.U.S. director.

65
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,156
Maybe she can help.

66
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,376
Yeah, well, any inquiries to
A.R.G.U.S. will send up red flags,

67
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,234
paint an even bigger target on
Lyla's back than there already is.

68
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,279
I think I might have an
old contact at the D.I.A.

69
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,190
A General.

70
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,476

what's going on?

You're acting like we're
being sent

74
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,160
to the principal's office.

75
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,680
This guy can be
a real hard-ass.

76
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,280
Just let me do the talking.

77
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,238
OK. How do you know him?

78
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,996
Ah. I must say,
I was surprised to hear from you, John.

79
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,639
Well, sir, I wouldn't
have made the call

80
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,155
unless it was very,
very important.

81
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,631
No, I imagine you
wouldn't have.

82
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,679
You must be
Oliver Queen...

83
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,797
the legendary
Green Arrow.

84
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,473
I'm General Stewart.

85
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,616
A pleasure to meet you,
General Stewart.

86
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,736
Thank you for taking
the time.

87
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,400
I'm not gonna lie, son.
I wasn't always a fan.

88
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,914
But since you
got out of prison,

89
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,595
you seem like a changed man,
and I respect that.

90
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,796
Thank you, sir.

91
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,056
Sir, we made the call
because we were hoping

92
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,296
you could tell us what
was on this.

93
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,880
Ah. Where'd
you get it?

94
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,520
We intercepted a handoff
between an A.R.G.U.S. agent

95
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,480
and a man that works for a
group called The Ninth Circle.

96
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,040
The terrorist
financiers.

97
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,395
I heard they
were just a rumor.

98
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,676
No, sir,
they are very real.

99
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,736
And we have reason to suspect
they are planning something.

100
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,797
We were hoping you had
intel that you could give us

101
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,155
and the SCPD.

102
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,596
I'm afraid I can't.
[Sighs]

103
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,275
But even if I did,
John, you know

104
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,471
I can't just hand over
classified intel,

105
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,153
not without
proper clearance,

106
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,590
which you no longer have
since you left A.R.G.U.S.

107
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,176
Of course. But, sir, we
were still hoping that maybe

108
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,520
you could, uh...

109
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,751
you were on a path
destined for the Pentagon,

110
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,150
maybe even a post with
the joint chiefs.

111
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,674
Now where are you?

112
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,672
Working with the cops,
playing vigilante?

113
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,877
That's no career.
That's a dead end.

114
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,189
No offense.

115
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,636
John: <i>I wasn't even sure you
were keeping tabs on me.</i>

116
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,189
Sir, I had my reasons
for leaving A.R.G.U.S.

117
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,680
You left to protect
your wife.

118
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,275
I know you better
than you think.

119
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,319
And I'm sorry to say
you lost your way.

120
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,837
John: I didn't leave
A.R.G.U.S. for my career.

121
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,877
I left to protect
my family.

122
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,416
And that's not something
you would understand,

123
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,113
is it, sir?

124
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,590
John,
we should probably go.

125
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,713
Again, thank you
for your time, General.

126
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,315
I always have time
for my family.

127
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,914
Excuse me?

128
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,754
Oh, John didn't
tell you.

129
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,314
I'm his stepfather.

130
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,277
Frak! Ugh!

131
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,714
[Moans]

132
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,840
Well, I guess I don't have
to ask how this is going.

133
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,634
Well, as glad as I am that
you both got to meet Laurel,

134
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,360
her cry really did
a number on this helmet.

135
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,159
How did it go
at the bunker?

136
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,835
Good. The bombs we stole from
Galaxy One are now secure.

137
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,718
Roy and Dinah are
setting up a perimeter

138
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,336
in case they ever come
looking for them.

139
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,056
And William is making sure
they can't be detonated

140
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,151
unless,
well, we say so.

141
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,436
Mia: Although maybe
he'd be more useful

142
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,670
helping you out with this?

143
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,796
The helmet is inlaid

144
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,376
with this highly
advanced circuitry mesh

145
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,517
and retinal display,
and I will not be able

146
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,216
to figure out why until I
get it up and running.

147
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,376
What do you think
you'll find?

148
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,280
Hopefully, whatever
Galaxy One has planned next,

149
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,676
if they haven't stopped from
making the city go boom-boom.

150
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,672
Well,
can't we just ask our man on the inside?

151
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,976
No. We can't come in
contact with Rene

152
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,480
until we get
the go-ahead from Zoe.

153
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,800
They're at Glades
city hall now,

154
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,360
and we don't want to
blow their cover.

155
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,991
OK, so how do we get this
piece of junk up and running?

156
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,753
The power module
is comprised

157
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,797
with an alloy
proprietary to Galaxy One.

00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,473
I've been trying
to work around it,

00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,313
but I can't without
the real thing.

160
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,496
Wait. I thought
this helmet was

161
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,874
a one-of-a-kind
prototype.

162
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,656
As far as we know. But
the power module is not,

163
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,319
which means we
need to find one.

All right, public enemy

You know she's not

175
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,317
Of course
she's not.

176
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,960
No. I am just so glad
that we were able

177
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,679
to start building the
program out again.

178
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,877
It feels wrong confining
Archer to just one tablet,

179
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,960
even temporarily.

Oliver's evil half-sister.

Speaking of
spreading wings, um,

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,596
I think I've found a way to
help Smoak Tech really soar.

Oh, yeah?

185
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,376
Yeah. There's someone interested
in buying the company.

186
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,536
It's just you, me,
and Archer.

187
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,976
I mean, who would be
interested in that?

188
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,434
Dr. Will Magnus.

My friend at Magnus Labs
says that Archer

196
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,599
could really help Doc Magnus with
these new a.I.S he's building.

197
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,990
I could set a meeting.

200

Oh, my god. With their backing,
we could expand Archer to be

201
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,856
more than just
a genetic tracking system

202
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,976
or surveillance
for the SCPD.

203
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,674
I mean, it could be a bigger and
better overwatch system. I mean...

of a Ninth Circle mole
inside A.R.G.U.S.

Since then, we've
made it a point

00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,192
of tracking their
activity, including

244
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,033

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,311
A list of assets we have
in the field...

252
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,036
special operatives with
high-level security clearance.

253

Felicity: <i>That's why
Emiko took Archer,</i>

254
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,234
so that she could
hunt them down

255
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,816
and then gain access
to what they know,

256
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,433
which she could
pretty much do

257
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,637
with anybody now that
she has their DNA.

258

It's only a matter of time before
they find everyone on that list.

259

We need to make sure
those assets are secure.

260

We have protocols in place.

268

That's not like you, John.

269
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,718
You expect me to say
"yes, sir" to that man?

to know why you won't.

And...

272
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,920
I would like to know
why you never...

273
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,437
never mentioned that
you had a stepfather.

274
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,840
I didn't see much
of a need to.

275
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,714
That man has not
been in my life

276
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,797
since I left home
and joined the military.

277
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,314
OK. I just met him.

278
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,993
All I have is my
first impression,

279
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,280
and my first
impression is that

280
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,913
he doesn't seem like
that bad of a guy.

281
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,311
Oliver, when I first met
the General,

282
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,157
he was a lieutenant,

283
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,711

a covert military op

284

to quell an insurgency
in vlatava.

285
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,559

<i>The unit was pinned down</i>

287

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,518

291
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,313
So do you blame him
for your father's death?

292
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,836
It was his op.
He should've stayed behind.

Six months, Oliver.

296
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,990
I didn't know.

297
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,275
It was bad enough that, uh,

298
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,556
he just appeared
in our lives, but...

299
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,629
Once he and my mom
got married,

300
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,871
he had me and Andy running

301
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,078
Spartan survival drills he
learned as a recon marine.

302

<i>trying to find our way out of
the woods without a compass.</i>

304
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,352
He called it "tough love."

305
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,440
Said he didn't care how we
felt about him

306
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,874
as long
as it made us strong.

307
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,872
I don't know.
If he was so strong,

308
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:54,476
how could he just abandon
the first rule of the corps

309
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,675
and leave my father behind?

310
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,355
- Thanks. Owe you one.
- You got it.

311
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,236
You get a lead?

312

afraid to talk.

00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,790
for his father's death
during a mission

473
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,678
they were both on
in vlatava.

474
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,592
Oh, yeah. That would be
enough to alienate

475
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,275
someone like John,
and why he wouldn't have told us about him,

476
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,591
but it's not true.

477
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,716
Which part?

478
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,096
According to the Pentagon's
official account,

479
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,736
the vlatava mission was
so successful that

480
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,536
the General was actually,
for a stint of time,

481
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,994
appointed Head of DARPA.

482
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:42,596
But if... If the mission
was a success,

483
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,797
why would he lie
to John about it?

484
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,234
To protect him?

485
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,399
It's been a long time since we've
seen each other, agent Diggle.

486
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,520
Go to hell.

487
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,795
Hold that thought.

488
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,951
I want the codes to

to do with him.

Give me the codes or...

You all right,
John?

512
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,278
Why did you give him
the code?

513
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,074
A thank you would
be good enough.

Cygnus X-1 anyway?

Something we don't want The
Ninth Circle to know about.

anything I taught you, do you?

for giving up that info
to Dante.

You don't leave

Sooner or later, they're gonna
send someone looking for us.

Oliver: What'd The Ninth Circle
want from you, General?

542
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,075
Access to an experimental
weapon I oversaw

543
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,594
during my tenure at DARPA...

544
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,751
Cygnus X-1.

545
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,230
The project was shelved
because it was too dangerous

546
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,198
and unstable.

547
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,875
The goal was to genetically
engineer bacteria

548
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,435
to consume the by-product
of nuclear fission.

eat through anything.

551
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,918
- That's terrifying.
- Yeah.

552
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,776
A weapon like that falls in the
hands of the Ninth Circle, we're...

553
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,190
it won't.
We're gonna stop them.

554
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,715
The problem is
I don't know where it is.

- Archer.
- Great.

556
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,873
They are going to use

557
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,314
the intel they get
from the assets

558
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,110
to locate the DNA of the
people involved in Cygnus X-1.

559
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,520
That DNA
can lead them

560
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,398
to exactly where
that weapon is.

Lead us right
to them.

564
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,757
It's like we're tracking
the DNA of a DNA tracker.

This is so meta.

We need to be ready the moment
they reactivate Archer.

It's the only way
to locate her signature.

568
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,680
Yeah, like one of
those FBI movies

the kidnapper on the line

to trace the call.

571
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,736
Yeah, except the kidnapper
is the tech I invented,

572
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,274
which almost makes me
wish I hadn't.

all the bad that
she could do.

00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,056
I wanted to invent something
that would help save the city,

00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,640

that can destroy it.

We just need to get
Archer back,

599
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,593

how to make sure that
your beautiful creation

was trying to protect you.

he deserves a little bit more of your trust.

Well, technically,

Yup, that's definitely
a secret weapons depot.

OK, well, now that
we know where we're going,

The moment you
set foot onsite,

The Ninth Circle will
know that you're there.

00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,994
If I'm a hero...

791
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,114
It was all because
of you...

792
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,913
Sir.

793
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,793
- John.
- Yes, sir.

794
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,394
Call your mother.

795
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,856
Felicity: I figured out
the silver lining

796
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,918
to the whole torpedoing
our only viable product is

797
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,656
that we are gonna save
so much money on servers

798
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,672
because Archer was
a power suck.

799
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,710
Not even a chuckle.

800
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,856
I guess I'm not
really in the mood

801
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,109
for the whole
dark humor thing,

802
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,481
what with our only viable
product being destroyed and all.

803
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,871
I'm sorry I destroyed
our golden goose.

804
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,156
Golden egg. Goose?

805
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,833
You know, we could rebuild.

806
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:22,039
Make it better,
less stealable.

807
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,315
Heh.

808
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,193
When you were uploading
the self-destruct code,

809
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:31,432
I copied Archer's root code.

810
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:37,753
But with that and your notes,
we could start over.

811
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:41,436
No. I appreciate that.

812
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,696
But as long as Archer's
out there,

813
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,315
it could fall into
the wrong hands. And...

814
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,856
I don't know what my
legacy's going to be,

815
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,917
but it can't be that.

816
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,195
Well, that sounds
like someone

817
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,640
who hasn't heard
Doc Magnus' offer.

818
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,194
[Low whistle]

819
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,079
Relax. I know.

820
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,950
Legacy trumps payday.

821
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,816
Well, I'm really glad you're
the cto and not the cfo,

822
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,056
because the cfo wouldn't
be so chill

823
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:04,073
about me deleting our
only, only asset.

824
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,356
I have a question.
Do we have a cfo?

825
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,238
No. Quick question,
do we need one?

826
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,073
Hmm, I think we should
probably focus

827
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,919
on coming up
with our next project,

828
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,719
one that makes us
a lot of money.

829
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,792
Yes. One that
can help people

830
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,554
but also not lead
to mass destruction.

831
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,790
[Sighs] If we have to.

832
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,634
Yes, we do. We must.

833
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,679
Hey, for what it's worth,
being overwatch

834
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,280
won't be your only legacy.

835
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:31,400
It'll be whatever you do
next here at Smoak Tech.

836
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,589
Because it's not Archer that was
destined to change the world.

837
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,514
It's you... Felicity Smoak.

838
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,750
Thank you.

839
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,800
[Alena chuckles]

840
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,640
Felicity:
All right, madame helmet,

841
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,558
let's see what
you're hiding.

842
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,154
Here goes nothing.

843
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,640
It seems like it worked.

844
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,995
That's not possible.

845
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,080
What is it?

846
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,096
This helmet is a satellite
to a much larger network.

847
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,952
Galaxy One was able
to expand Archer.

848
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,236
Hold on. I know big brother
getting bigger

849
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:14,996
isn't exactly great, but isn't Archer
just a surveillance program?

850
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,136
No, not if you
weaponize it.

851
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,216
Wearing one of these
would be like

852
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,416
wearing an a.I.
- Powered sixth sense.

853
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:21,319
Pair that with tech-enhanced
strength and agility.

854
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,198
<i>One of those troopers
was able to take out</i>

855
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,794
<i>half the canaries.</i>

856
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,556
<i>A whole army of them,
they'll be unstoppable.</i>

857
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:40,076
Acquiring that weapon
was a great victory,

858
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,755
but Oliver Queen is
still a threat.

859
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,696
You need to deal with your
brother before he jeopardizes

860
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,154
the last phase of
the plan.

861
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,999
I couldn't
agree more.

862
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,798
But first things
first.

863
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:59,440
You lied to me,
you betrayed me,

864
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,789
and you killed
my mother.

865
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,030
[Grunts]

866
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,520
[Coughs and groans]

867
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,479
Emiko, you
don't understand.

868
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,200
Stop lying...

869
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:12,358
- [Groans]
- And tell me why.

870
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:15,672
She was the last reminder
of your former life.

871
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,672
Your mother was making
you weak

872
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,240
just like your father did.

873
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,835
And I needed you strong

874
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,313
to lead The Ninth Circle.

875
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,279
She was the only
family I had.

876
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,113
No, we are
your family.

877
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,193
Don't you see?
I did it for you.

878
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:35,159
[Grunts]

879
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:40,156
This is for my mother.

880
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,720
Rot in hell.

881
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,634
Man:
<i>Greg, move your head.</i>
