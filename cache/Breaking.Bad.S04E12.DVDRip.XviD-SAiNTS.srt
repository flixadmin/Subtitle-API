1
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,748
They're here, out front.

2
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,996
- How many?
- Nelson Brey, three others.

3
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,474
- His toothbrush?
- Got it.

4
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,795
What about your stuff?

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,958
Oh, we'll talk to them
about stopping at your place.

6
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,116
Skyler. Skyler.

7
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,435
- What?
- I'm not going.

8
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,996
- What?
- I'm not going to Hank and Marie's.

9
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,839
- We're in danger.
- Yes, that's true. Because of me.

10
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,519
It doesn't matter.

11
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,995
All that matters
is the rest of you are safe.

12
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,873
And that's why
I'm not going with you.

13
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,149
I'm the real target.

14
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,272
- But we'll all be safer at Hank's.
- No, no, no.

15
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,994
No one will be safe at Hank's
if I'm there.

16
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,668
Walt, it's the DEA.

17
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,996
Skyler, you don't know these people.

18
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,519
- I -
- No. Skyler, please.

19
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,075
Trust me. This is how it has to be.

20
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,431
Those agents outside.
They're not gonna just leave you here.

21
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,119
It's protective custody.

22
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,915
All they know is that Hank
is the only person that's in danger.

23
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,351
They're including us as a courtesy
to Marie, to keep her happy.

24
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,475
How am I supposed to explain that
to Marie or Junior? Or Hank?

25
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,079
I don't know.

26
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,350
But you'll do it. You'll figure it out.

27
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,350
Hank knows that Marie
will be overreacting.

28
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,352
Except she's not.

29
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:49,275
I'll talk to Hank. You just back me up
with everyone else.

30
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:53,712
You really expect me to say,
"Okay, Walt, sure. Just stay here and"...

31
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,793
No.

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,752
There's gotta be another way.

33
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,949
There isn't.

34
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,552
There was.

35
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,997
But now there isn't.

36
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,152
Walt...

37
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,550
...how long till you're safe?

38
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,115
Till you can work this out?

39
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,077
Oh, Skyler.

40
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,795
No.

41
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,673
- Skyler.
- No.

42
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,829
I have lived under the threat of death
for a year now.

43
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:31,359
And because of that,
I've made choices.

44
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,391
- I -
- Listen to me.

45
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,831
I alone should suffer the consequences
of those choices, no one else.

46
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,193
And those consequences...

47
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,438
...they're coming.

48
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,638
No more prolonging the inevitable.

49
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,590
Feed that belt through
those seatbelt holders.

50
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,836
Hank, I've got a car wash to run.

51
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:08,272
I mean, you don't honestly believe
that I'm in danger, do you? Me?

52
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,871
Oh, Jesus, it's gonna go over like a
lead balloon. It'll be Marie that kills me.

53
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,072
Well, just know that I'll get there
as soon as I can.

54
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,590
And let Steve Gomez know.
I told his guys.

55
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,631
And just stay safe.

56
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,479
Oh, please.
Whole thing's just a giant jerk-off.

57
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,753
Yeah, yeah. But keep your head down
anyway, all right?

58
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,439
All right.

59
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,870
All right, buddy. Take care.

60
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,959
I know.

61
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,673
Okay, sweetie.

62
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,311
Okay, my love. Okay. Okay.

63
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,794
Okay, my darling. It's okay.

64
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,228
All right.

65
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,237
Okay.

66
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,593
He's gonna risk his life
over a stupid car wash?

67
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,394
Does he understand
what's going on with Uncle Hank?

68
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,192
He'll come when he's able.

69
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,436
That's pathetic. I -

70
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,200
How hard did you even try
or did you?

71
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,597
- Hey, hey, hey. Lay off your mom.
- Well, you know, Hank.

72
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,032
We wouldn't be arguing about this if
you and Steve would make him come.

73
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,958
Why didn't you put him
in the car?

74
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,197
- It's not Nazi Germany, all right?
- Oh, you- Nazi Germany.

75
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,995
If I had a dollar for every time
I heard that. I'm gonna call him.

76
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:11,159
He's gonna get his behind here.
Immediately. End of story.

77
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,590
Thank you,
at least somebody is listening.

78
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,190
- Because we are all in danger here.
- We're not all in danger here.

79
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,154
Will you stop saying that?
That is asking for trouble.

80
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,273
Come on, Walt.

81
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,753
He's not picking up.

82
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,032
Look, could we just take this down
a notch, okay? Everybody?

83
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,549
You guys can stay here
as long as you like.

84
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,909
We got plenty of room.

85
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,511
I wouldn't worry about any danger
to Walt or any of us, okay?

86
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,069
This whole thing
is just a damn smoke screen.

87
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:48,114
- How do you mean "a smoke screen"?
- An anonymous threat against me?

88
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,788
I'm stuck in a wheelchair,
I'm not even on the job.

89
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,709
No, someone didn't like the way
I've been spending my free time.

90
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,717
What? Minerals?

91
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,430
Timing seem a bit odd to you, huh?

92
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,198
I start looking...

93
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,153
...into Fring,
I'm under lockdown for my protection.

94
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,032
- Did you say-?
- Gus Fring?

95
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,151
- What-?
- From the chicken restaurant?

96
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,476
Hank, what are you talking about?

97
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,198
Just one man's humble opinion,
that's all.

98
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,470
I think Los Pollos Hermanos
is a front...

99
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,592
...for the biggest meth distributor
in the Southwest.

100
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,156
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Steve, are you even looking into this?

101
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,830
We're looking into everything.
But we work on fact, not conjecture.

102
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:36,477
And the fact is that the scumbags
that hit you first were Mexican cartel...

103
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,148
...not some German multinational
whatever.

104
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,952
Definitely not Colonel Sanders.

105
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,196
Now, if we even had a shred of proof -

106
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,516
Isn't that what you get paid
to go get?

107
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,390
From that laundry I told you about.
I'd start there.

108
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,669
- Come on, man.
- Jesus.

109
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,757
It's the perfect spot
for a meth superlab.

110
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,279
Oh, my God.

111
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,674
Hey...

112
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,469
...what if I'm right?

113
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,319
Even if you were right- And you ain't.

114
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,512
- There's no way a judge
is gonna give me a warrant.

115
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,030
Warrant? What happened
to good old-fashioned knock and talk?

116
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,673
Oh, that's right.

117
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,869
I forgot.

118
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,799
You were never very good at those,
were you?

119
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,393
- Can I help you?
- Yes, sir.

120
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,034
We wondered
if we could take a look around.

121
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,229
Why?

122
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,271
- Sorry, what's your name?
- Dennis.

123
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,314
Dennis. Hey. I'm Steve Gomez.
I'm with the DEA. Drug Enforcement.

124
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,635
Is there a problem?

125
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,068
For you? No. No problem.

126
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,078
We were just wondering
if we could take a look around.

127
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,037
Can I tell you a story?

128
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,832
- Yeah.
- I bust this chef.

129
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,359
Well, he says he's a chef.

130
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,916
Because you work at a restaurant
that charges $14 for a burger...

131
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,192
...that don't make you a chef.
Makes you a burger-flipper.

132
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,799
- Least in my book.
- Yeah.

133
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,673
Anyway, so we bust this chef,
heroin possession.

134
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:24,476
He says, "Just because you found heroin
in my chef whites doesn't make it mine.

135
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:28,355
Maybe it came from the place that
launders my chef whites. " This place.

136
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,597
- We don't do that stuff over here.
- I know, I know.

137
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,313
I'll say it for you.

138
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,193
His story is a big load
of steaming horse shit.

139
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,631
We're gonna find heroin here
like we're gonna find Jimmy Hoffa.

140
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,989
Right?

141
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,751
The thing is that this chef's daddy
is a United States senator.

142
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,713
I'm not gonna tell which one,
but you know who he is.

143
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:53,232
So now I gotta waste my time
checking out this burger-flipper's story.

144
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,670
If I don't,
his old man's gonna jam me up...

145
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,110
...my ASAC, my whole entire office.

146
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,912
Politics, huh?

147
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,235
So, what do you think?

148
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,556
Listen, I have to check
on my boss.

149
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,957
He's out of town. I can't promise
I'll reach him anytime soon.

150
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,276
Well, yeah.
That's probably the way to go.

151
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,313
I'll have to go get a warrant
and we'll do it official.

152
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,351
You have to close down for the day.

153
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,518
- What-? Why?
- Twenty agents poking around?

154
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,756
It'd be less trouble if it was just us.

155
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,758
But your call.

156
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,676
Just the two of you?
You make it quick, right?

157
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,394
Dennis, we'll be like the wind.

158
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,756
- Okay.
- Could you tell him?

159
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,633
- Okay.
- Okay.

160
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,949
Can you clear out
some of your people for us?

161
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,435
Confuses the dog's nose.

162
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,793
So...

163
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,789
...how long we gotta be quiet
down here?

164
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,272
And what happens after this?

165
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,711
Provided they don't find their way
in here and bust our asses?

166
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,311
I gotta be, like, snuck down here in a
laundry hamper for the rest of eternity?

167
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,955
Now, I'm going on record.

168
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,628
This blows.

169
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,113
Hello.

170
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,919
For you.

171
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,118
Yeah?

172
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,749
Do you know
what's happening upstairs?

173
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,951
I have a pretty good idea.

174
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,993
This is all the result
of your former partner.

175
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,836
Do you understand now?

176
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,153
Do you see why this can't continue?

177
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,669
I get it.
The guy is a complete and total dick.

178
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,950
But I can't.

179
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,151
I'm not signing off.

180
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,238
Okay?

181
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,197
Like I said...

182
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:17,953
...if something final happens
to Mr. White...

183
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,315
...we're going to have a problem.

184
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,875
So, what are you gonna do?

185
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,589
There will be
an appropriate response.

186
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,518
Appropriate? What does that mean?

187
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,153
Hello?

188
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,393
They're gone.

189
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,078
We're good.

190
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,478
You have reached Walter White.

191
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,797
Please state your name, number
and the reason for your call.

192
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,274
Thank you.

193
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,318
You have six new messages.

194
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,353
Hey, kid. It's me, Goodman.
Give me a call, would you?

195
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,990
Hey, need to hear from you.
Hope I made myself clear about that.

196
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,714
Call me as soon as you can.

197
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,596
Pinkman, get over here. Stat, pronto.

198
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,429
Don't call, just get over here.
Would you just, please?

199
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,870
I don't know
if I'm speaking English here -

200
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,475
- What's up? He's waiting for me.
- Hold up. Hold up.

201
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,874
What the hell, man?

202
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,550
Get off of me. Hey, Goodman.
Get out here.

203
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,718
- Hey. Yo, get your goon off me.
- Not him, moron. Drop.

204
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:39,310
Leave it. Go lie down. Sorry.
You can't be too careful these days.

205
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,748
Come on, come on.

206
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,679
Lock the door, Frisky. Jesus.

207
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,398
Take a break, H.T. Let's go.

208
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,194
Stop calling me that
or I'll hang you by your tie.

209
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,630
Yeah, yeah.
Stop showing off for the client.

210
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,957
Honey Tits. I say it's endearing.

211
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,358
So, what's so important?

212
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,835
Well, they're here.
The end times, kid.

213
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,270
- End times.
- What does that mean?

214
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,913
Why'd you drag me here for?

215
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,476
You want your money, don't you?
I assume that you do.

216
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,795
That couldn't wait?

217
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,594
Ever hear of the expression,
"A fart in the wind"?

218
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,839
Inside of an hour, that will be me,
I'm hitting the road. I'm out of here.

219
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,000
- What, for, like, good?
- For as long as it takes.

220
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,794
I don't like my heat so hot
if you catch my drift.

221
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,036
I'm not catching anything
you're saying.

222
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,389
What is your problem?

223
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,751
- You haven't talked to your partner?
- Not since last night.

224
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:36,078
Today, he didn't show up to work
and the DEA just happened to raid us.

225
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,479
Yeah, some coincidence, huh?

226
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,752
Yeah, I don't know about that.

227
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:45,475
All I know is when he tells me
that your employer took him out...

228
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,353
...threatening to murder his family,
I take notice.

229
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,790
Because after all,
what am I, if not family?

230
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,719
What are you talking about?
When did that happen?

231
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,799
I don't know. Forget it.

232
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,230
I mean, he exaggerates, right?
He does that.

233
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,317
Hey, listen. Do me a favour.

234
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:06,469
Put in a good word for me with Fring.
I mean, just for old time's sake.

235
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,717
I can't afford
to butter the wrong bread here.

236
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,993
Yeah?

237
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,475
Hey.

238
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,033
Hey.

239
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,709
Nothing, huh?

240
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,319
Clean as a whistle...

241
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,956
...so he says.

242
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,073
You've reached Walter White.

243
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,192
State your name, number
and the reason for your call.

244
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,833
Thank you.

245
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,678
It's me again.

246
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,510
I really wish you'd pick up.

247
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,272
God, I just...

248
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,238
Call me back, okay?

249
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,668
Just...

250
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,676
Just call me back, please.

251
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,396
Hi. I'm sorry. Is it okay
if I come out here for a few minutes?

252
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,076
Sure.
Just stay up here, if you would.

253
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,633
Okay.

254
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,517
Excuse me.

255
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,514
I wonder if you have a -
An extra cigarette.

256
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,234
I sure could use a smoke
right about now.

257
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,919
Sure.

258
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,713
Thank you.

259
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,918
Thanks.

260
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,275
Hey, what's up?

261
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,274
What?

262
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,074
Hey. Hey.

263
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,198
What's wrong with him?

264
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,758
What hospital?

265
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,073
Andrea.

266
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,633
Jesse.

267
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,149
- Where's Brock?
- Inside. Grandma's with him.

268
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:32,355
- They got me filling all this paperwork.
- How is he doing? Tell me.

269
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,279
The doctors,
they don't know what it is exactly.

270
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,392
It's like he's got the flu.

271
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:42,070
But he just keeps getting worse.

272
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,590
Jesse, I don't understand.

273
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,677
He was fine this morning.

274
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,673
He was fine.

275
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,517
- Andrea Cantillo?
- Right here.

276
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,713
Miss Cantillo, we're gonna go
admit your son to the Paediatric ICU.

277
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,956
- You can bring that with you.
- Okay.

278
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,549
- Sir, you're the boy's father?
- No.

279
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,116
Okay. Sorry. It's just we try to keep it
to two visitors maximum.

280
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,756
Go, go, go. I'll be out here
if you need me. Go. Go ahead.

281
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,552
No.

282
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,718
No, no.

283
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,036
No. No. No.

284
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,390
Come on. Come on.

285
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,073
Come on.

286
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,509
No. No!

287
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,152
Andrea!

288
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,349
Andrea.

289
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,278
- Hey. No yelling.
- I need to -

290
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,914
- We can't have you here.
- I need to talk to her.

291
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,429
- I need to tell her -
- Take this outside.

292
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,756
- My son is sick in here.
- No, just- Come here.

293
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,678
Jesse...

294
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,078
What is it?

295
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,828
Jesse, I can't go out.
My son's in here.

296
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:32,591
Okay. I'm thinking Brock
may have been poisoned, okay?

297
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,869
What?

298
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,356
There's this stuff,
this stuff called ricin.

299
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,472
Sounds like rice. You need
to tell the doctors about it.

300
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,113
What? How do you know?

301
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,278
Doesn't matter.
Just tell them it's a guess. Okay?

302
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,914
Ricin.
They'll know what you're talking about.

303
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,635
Jesse, if there's something
you're not saying, you have to tell me.

304
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,671
I gotta go. I gotta go see someone.

305
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,598
- Jesse.
- I'm sorry, I gotta go.

306
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,279
Just tell them, okay?

307
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,357
Now. Just do it.

308
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,148
Hello. Could you buzz me in, please?

309
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,316
Buzz me in!

310
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,478
What do you want?

311
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,432
We need to talk.

312
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,150
- Who's with you?
- No one. Just me.

313
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,395
Let me in.

314
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,228
I don't know what you're thinking
coming here.

315
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,791
Oh, Christ.

316
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,831
What does it matter?

317
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:10,510
Everything, it's all coming to an end.

318
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,029
Do you even know
what's happening?

319
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,435
The full scope of what's happening?

320
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,510
They took me out into the desert.

321
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,392
They put a hood over my head...

322
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,034
...and drove me out into the desert
on my knees.

323
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,789
They threatened my family
and not just Hank.

324
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,154
My wife, my children.

325
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,114
It's just a matter of time now.

326
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,991
I was able to protect them for now,
but...

327
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,308
Gus is gonna make his move.

328
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:07,599
And I don't- I don't know when.

329
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:11,395
I don't know where or how.

330
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,879
All I know is it's gonna happen.

331
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,354
And I'm powerless to stop him.

332
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,639
What are you doing?

333
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,871
Why did you do it?

334
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,832
- Why?
- Jesse.

335
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,278
Gus gave me no choice.

336
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,950
I had to call the DEA to protect
my family. What else could I do-?

337
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:46,436
No. No, you son of a bitch.
You know what you did.

338
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,232
Okay, look, just -

339
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,272
Just put the gun down, okay?

340
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,994
Just put it down and we'll talk,
all right?

341
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,033
You tell me
what it is you think I did.

342
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,355
Brock.

343
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,709
Why did you poison him?

344
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,798
- Who's Brock?
- You saw him in my living room.

345
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,959
You came and you looked right at him,
so don't tell me you don't know him.

346
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,798
The boy?

347
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,151
Jesse, I have no idea
who these people are.

348
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,349
Now, please.

349
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:16,109
Okay,
that's Brock and he was poisoned?

350
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,753
The ricin.

351
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:21,350
He's dying because someone gave it
to him.

352
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:26,270
And only you and I were the only two
people on earth who knew about it.

353
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,959
No, wait a minute.

354
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,594
Wait a minute.
Maybe he went into your pockets -

355
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,870
No! I had it.

356
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:36,550
I had the cigarette with the ricin
in my pack this morning.

357
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,069
The last time I saw Brock
was last night.

358
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,317
And this morning, I switched
the cigarette into a new pack.

359
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,431
There's no way Brock took it himself.

360
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,756
Jesse, you're not thinking clearly.

361
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,758
You said it yourself
that you had it this morning.

362
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,030
When could I have possibly
gotten it?

363
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,435
You had Saul do it.

364
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,914
- What?
- Yeah.

365
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,872
Yeah. I went to his office.

366
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,957
He called me in,
had to see me today.

367
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,037
His big bodyguard patted me down.

368
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,993
That's when he must have stole it
off me. Right?

369
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,954
That's the plan? Was that the plan?

370
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,359
Jesse.

371
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,359
Why?

372
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,518
Why in God's name
would I poison a child?

373
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,870
To get back at me.

374
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,437
Because I'm helping Gus...

375
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:28,236
...and this is your way of ripping my
heart out before you're dead and gone.

376
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,158
Just admit it.

377
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:33,511
Admit what you did. Admit it.

378
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,711
- I did not do this!
- Shut up!

379
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,714
Stop lying!

380
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,831
Look, I'm not lying.

381
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:44,033
I'm not lying. Just listen to me.
What would I have to gain?

382
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,471
What possible-? Possible could I-?

383
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,875
Who-? Who would-?

384
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,192
Oh, my God.

385
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,039
Hey.

386
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,110
Stop laughing.

387
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,834
Stop laughing!

388
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,310
I have been waiting -

389
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,594
I've been waiting all day...

390
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:21,516
...waiting for Gus
to send one of his men to kill me.

391
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,958
And it's you.

392
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:32,399
Who do you know
who's okay with using children?

393
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:37,549
Jesse, who do you know who's allowed
children to be murdered?

394
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,193
Gus.

395
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,719
He has been 10 steps ahead of me
at every turn.

396
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:47,833
And now, the one thing
that he needed to finally get rid of me...

397
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:51,271
...is your consent.
And, boy, he's got that now. He's got it.

398
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,516
And not only does he have that...

399
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:56,678
...he manipulated you
into pulling the trigger for him.

400
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,519
No, only you and I knew about the ricin.

401
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,711
No, you don't even believe that.

402
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,589
Gus has cameras everywhere.
Please.

403
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,313
Listen to yourself.

404
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,954
No, he has known everything
all along.

405
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,071
Where were you today? In the lab?

406
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:15,831
You don't think it's possible that Tyrus
lifted the cigarette out of your locker?

407
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,553
Come on.

408
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,998
Don't you see?

409
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,634
You are the last piece of the puzzle.

410
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,910
You are everything that he's wanted.

411
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,917
You're his cook now.

412
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:31,113
You're the cook and you have proven
that you can run a lab without me.

413
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:34,153
And now that cook
has a reason to kill me.

414
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,748
Think about it.

415
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,030
It's brilliant.

416
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,992
So go ahead.

417
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,273
Go on.

418
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,233
If you think that I am capable
of doing this...

419
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,873
...then go...

420
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:54,395
...put a bullet in my head
and kill me right now.

421
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,394
- I'll do it.
- Do it!

422
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,676
- Do it.
- I'll do it.

423
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,359
Do it.

424
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,478
Do it.

425
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,354
- Where are you going?
- Find the son of a bitch...

426
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,232
- ...and I'm gonna kill him.
- No.

427
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,154
Don't.

428
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,316
He'll see you coming.

429
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,393
You'll die
before you get anywhere near him.

430
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,589
I don't care.

431
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,358
Jesse.

432
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,072
Jesse, just get in your car.

433
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,554
Just go.

434
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,557
Just drive.

435
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,593
No.

436
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:04,395
I'm going to do this
one way or another, Mr. White.

437
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,876
Then let me help.

438
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:41,876
Jesus. Mr. Pinkman,
I'm not gonna keep telling you.

439
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,709
Unless the family wants you in there,
you're not allowed.

440
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,798
You can't keep coming in here
like this.

441
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,513
You hear me?

442
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,199
You understand?

443
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,710
Mr. Pinkman, I'm gonna call security.

444
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,119
All right, here I go.

445
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,558
Come on now.

446
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:09,475
Mr. Pinkman, final warning.

447
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,238
Hey.

448
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,039
You need to be at work, now.

449
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:46,598
I already told you. I'm not going.

450
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,512
Got a batch that'll be ruined...

451
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:55,429
...and an employer who will be
very upset if that happens.

452
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:58,916
And I could give a shit.

453
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,798
I'm not leaving here.

454
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:05,512
If my employer has a problem with that,
he can tell me himself.

455
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,597
Not his errand boy.

456
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,354
Idiot.

457
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,633
Hey, I don't know this guy.

458
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:20,230
Call security. I'm being attacked.

459
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,749
Yeah.

460
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,278
That's right.

461
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,872
We've got a situation.

462
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,396
He'd like to speak with you.

463
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,229
I told you, I'm not leaving.

464
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,556
He's downstairs.

465
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,315
Tyrus told me what's happening.

466
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,551
The sick child.

467
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:11,192
I understand your preoccupation,
but, Jesse, I am running a business.

468
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,788
I need you back at the lab
to complete the cook.

469
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,397
You can return when you're done.

470
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,632
I can't.

471
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:26,359
It is, as you must know,
in both of our best interests.

472
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:32,559
That little boy upstairs is dying.

473
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:37,075
I can't be away.
I don't even wanna be here now.

474
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,669
I can't be away,
if something happens, if he -

475
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,314
I am very sorry.

476
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,473
Is there anything I can do?

477
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,035
I am on the board of this hospital.

478
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,595
I can recommend doctors...

479
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,394
...make sure he gets
whatever he needs.

480
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,033
The best treatment.

481
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,111
He's not sick.

482
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,511
He was poisoned.

483
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,153
How did that happen?

484
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,551
The doctors...

485
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,471
...they don't know.

486
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,715
This current batch...

487
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:33,111
...is surely ruined now, correct?

488
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,711
Stay with the boy.

489
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,029
Tyrus will dump what's there
and clean the tanks.

490
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:59,189
You will start a new batch
when you are ready to return.

491
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,914
Next week.

492
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,351
There you are.

493
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,078
There you are.

494
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,309
Keep going.

495
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,669
Why did you stop?

496
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,590
Why did you stop?

497
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,509
Why did you stop?

498
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,511
Come on. Come on.

499
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,479
Come on. Come on.

500
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,960
No, no, no.
Don't go, don't go, don't go.

501
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,196
No. No.

502
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,750
Oh, shit.

503
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,399
No.
