2
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,500
Najid, cut the horses loose!

3
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,090
We have to turn back.

4
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,310
We have been riding
for six months.

5
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,310
And we've lost 20 men.

6
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,760
But we survived.

7
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,730
Yes. By chance.

8
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:10,150
Any one of us could
have met that same fate.

9
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,310
We were the strongest.

10
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,320
Remember why you're here.

11
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:18,230
In the West, we would be enemies,
and I would have to kill you.

12
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,150
At least here,
we have a common goal.

13
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:21,440
Oh, yes.

14
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,120
This black powder.

15
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,620
It turns air into fire.

16
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,410
And kills a dozen men
at one time.

17
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,410
It is the weapon of our dreams.

18
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,000
And what if it's just a myth?

19
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,010
Men have sent word
that it's real.

20
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,300
And those men are dead.

21
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:37,750
And we are next.

22
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,710
We have no maps,

23
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:41,180
no medicine

24
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,420
and no food.

25
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,180
No one is going back.

26
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,220
We take inventory
of what we have left

27
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,510
and finish what we started.

28
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:52,690
There's not much here.

29
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,730
The moon is strong.

30
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,850
When the horses
are fresh, we move.

31
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,810
- To where?
- North.

32
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:02,450
If they keep after us,
we'll kill them in the mountains.

33
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,940
The magnet.

34
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:07,740
Too heavy.

35
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,000
Useless.
I'll have it.

36
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,160
It's all yours.

37
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:21,000
Amigo, only you would carry a
stupid magnet through the desert.

38
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,680
I can use it to make a compass.

39
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,550
Rizzetti won't make it.

40
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,550
The wound is festering.

41
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:32,140
We'll be dragging a corpse.

42
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,320
I heard that.

43
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,390
He's earned the right
to die where he wants.

44
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:40,940
I've been left for dead twice.

45
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,190
It was bad luck.
For who?

46
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:44,990
The people who left me.

47
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,990
Maybe Rizzetti's right.

48
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,140
Where are they?

49
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,900
Hill tribes?

50
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,910
It's no man.

51
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,910
Then what is it?

52
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:34,750
Whatever it is, it's hunting.

53
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:47,460
What was that?
I don't know.

54
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:49,640
I took its hand.

55
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:52,140
- We need to move.
- Agreed.

56
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,510
I'll take the hand with us.

57
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:54,890
What the hell for?

58
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,180
So someone can tell me
what I just killed.

59
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:17,000
Persistent bastards,
aren't they?

60
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,670
We'll take the rise,
make a stand there.

61
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:24,510
What a long shitting
way to go to die.

62
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:13,180
Mother of God.

63
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:52,850
I have no need
to go down fighting.

64
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,430
Agreed.

65
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,440
I say we take our chances with
the gents in front of us.

66
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:01,100
I haven't surrendered
in a while, eh?

67
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,150
It'll come back to you.

68
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:14,740
Follow my lead, we'll be fine.

69
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,910
Of course, my friend.

70
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,740
Where you go, I follow.

71
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,750
You're doing such
a great job already.

72
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,170
They know what it is.

73
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,670
And they don't
look happy to see it.

74
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,500
All the more reason to get
the hell out of here.

75
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,550
Our weapons are on that table.

76
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:14,180
Have you lost your mind?

77
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:16,680
I can take out the guards on
the perimeter with my bow.

78
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:18,610
You cut the legs out
from under the officers.

79
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:21,180
I must confess, this is
not my favorite plan.

80
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,600
Where was this found?

81
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,860
You speak English.

82
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,530
Fantastic.

83
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,530
Where was this found?

84
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:37,030
It wasn't found.

85
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,860
It was taken.

86
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,240
That thing killed three men
before we took it down.

87
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,460
Where?

88
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,880
Two days' ride.

89
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:47,580
North, in the mountains.

90
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,610
Two of you, you did this?

91
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,610
Well...

92
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,940
I killed it.

93
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:11,440
Alone?

94
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,370
Tell me how.

95
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:24,750
A swing of the sword.

96
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,910
The hand, it came away clean.

97
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,960
The beast fell back
into a chasm.

98
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,130
Why are you here?

99
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,970
We came to trade.

100
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,050
We were ambushed.

101
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,350
You are soldiers.

102
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,080
Mmm.

103
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,650
Are you killing us, sister?

104
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,870
Two lost travelers?

105
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,170
I think she'd like that.

106
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,470
If it is death, my dear,
we need time to pray.

107
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,260
I'm trying here.

108
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,840
Sister, I know a siege
when I see one.

109
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,010
What comes at you so hard
you need a wall like this?

110
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,930
What the hell
did we kill out there?

111
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,550
Tao Tei.

112
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,570
You killed a Tao Tei scout.

113
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:56,020
You killed it alone.

114
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:57,860
You're correct.

115
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,360
We are under siege.

116
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,740
But we did not expect the
attack for another nine days.

117
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:05,070
Attack?
Tao Tei.

118
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:07,450
What the hell is a Tao Tei?

119
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,820
Many things about your
story have importance.

120
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,780
You are not to die today.

121
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:58,870
The black are the foot soldiers.

122
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:00,170
And the red?

123
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,450
Those are the archers.

124
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:19,940
And the blue?

125
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,520
They're all women.

126
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:22,850
What the hell do they do?

127
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,070
Look at this army.

128
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:41,910
Have you ever seen
anything like this?

129
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,620
Incredible.

130
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:05,400
They look nervous.

131
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:09,270
It's a big wall
to be so nervous.

132
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:29,210
Do you hear it?

133
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,450
William, over there.

134
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:07,960
Why isn't he tied up?

135
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:10,910
There's our escape.

136
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,070
We need to move!

137
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,710
We need to move or we die!

138
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:03,740
Go, go!

139
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:06,570
Go and fight!

140
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,790
Cut me loose!

141
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,590
Fight or run?

142
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,680
Run where?

143
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,260
Aim for the eyes!

144
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,680
William!

145
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,120
Hey! Bitch!

146
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,350
William.

147
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,840
I need a shot.

148
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,730
What god made those things?

149
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,570
None that we know.

150
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:08,260
Think they'll hang us now?

151
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:10,460
I could use the rest.

152
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,890
You've earned
General Shao's praise.

153
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,450
Will they come back?

154
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:42,590
Yes.

155
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:45,790
All we can do is prepare.

156
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,970
Who are you?

157
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:29,060
Easy.

158
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:33,940
I'm Ballard. Hmm?

159
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,280
William.

160
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,530
This is Tovar.

161
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,450
What are you doing here?

162
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,580
We came looking
for black powder.

163
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:46,910
I bet you did.

164
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,740
I came with mercenaries
for the same thing.

165
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,450
Twenty-five years ago.

166
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,420
And did you find it?

167
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:56,710
Finding it and leaving with it
alive are two different things.

168
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:03,720
You saved the west turret.
That was extremely diplomatic.

169
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:05,770
We weren't being diplomatic.

170
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,560
We were trying to stay alive.

171
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:12,810
You smell like animals.
Thank you.

172
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:19,700
Clean up

173
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,360
and they'll feed you.

174
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,580
He knows where the powder is.

175
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:29,830
Then why is he still here?

176
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:32,120
He needs help getting out?

177
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,760
Right.

178
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,460
We play our part,

179
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:39,550
take the powder and go home.

180
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:42,430
I didn't sign up for this.

181
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,590
Which part?

182
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:47,520
Well, all of it.
But mostly the monsters.

183
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,810
There's a lot of them.

184
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:55,230
We really do smell.

185
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,430
General Shao welcomes
you as honored guests

186
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:34,730
of the Nameless Order and thanks
you for your skill and courage.

187
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:40,400
We are honored to be honored.

188
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,190
Is that the best you've got?

189
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:03,110
Commander Chen thinks your bow

190
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,920
is not worthy of your skill.

191
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,880
Tell him there's no
better weapon here.

192
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,610
They wish to see you shoot.

193
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,120
In here?

194
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:34,370
What was that?

195
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,710
He thinks you have fear.

196
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,540
Too many people.

197
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,130
Get one of the cups.

198
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,540
Now?
Get one of the cups.

199
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,640
I want to eat.

200
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:54,770
You remember how to do this?

201
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:57,020
Last time didn't go so good.
We were drunk.

202
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:58,820
How high?

203
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:01,820
Ten yards.
Six hands to the right.

204
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:03,070
Turn around.

205
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,480
No, I'll do it this way.

206
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,530
On my count.
Amigo...

207
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,190
One.

208
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:09,330
Two.

209
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,660
Three.

210
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:14,740
Pull.

211
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,700
Good luck with that.

212
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:53,530
I want food.

213
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,080
Who taught you English?

214
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:56,700
Sir Ballard.

215
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,160
English and Latin.

216
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:03,370
Heard he's been here
for 25 years.

217
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:05,500
You won't let him leave.

218
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:07,340
He must stay here.

219
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:09,170
What about us?

220
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:13,800
Pace yourself.

221
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,350
The meals are regular here.

222
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:17,890
I hope not to stay that long.

223
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:19,430
I like your thinking,

224
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:22,350
but I suggest you keep
your plans private.

225
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,360
You aren't the first Westerners

226
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:26,360
to come here looking
for black powder.

227
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,700
We'll discuss it tonight.
Bring your partner.

228
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:32,280
How long have you been here?

229
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:33,450
Always.

230
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:36,660
I was not five years old
when I came here.

231
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,920
I have no other family.

232
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:40,750
We're the same.

233
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,800
I was given to an army
before I can remember.

234
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,170
As a soldier?

235
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:48,090
Worse.
As a gleaner.

236
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:51,050
Packs of children,
we'd clean the battlefields.

237
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:53,220
After, when the fighting's over.

238
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:56,600
I became a page,
a pikeman's boy...

239
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:58,640
For your country?

240
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:01,430
No. I fought for food.

241
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,980
You fight to eat.

242
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:06,560
You live long enough,
you fight for money.

243
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:09,860
How many flags do you fight for?

244
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,900
I don't know.

245
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:17,320
I fought for Harold
against the Danes.

246
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:20,790
I saved a Duke's life.
I fought for him until he died.

247
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:23,950
Fought for Spain
against the Franks.

248
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,960
Fought for the Franks
against Boulogne.

249
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:27,830
I fought for the Pope.

250
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:31,800
Many flags.

251
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,140
We are not the same.

252
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:46,820
Meet me on the Wall.
I have something to show you.

253
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:52,650
He should be careful with her.

254
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,320
She's very powerful here.

255
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:56,860
Then it is a fair contest.

256
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,500
Come.

257
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,930
Hmm.
You wish to try?

258
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,860
She says men
have so much to teach us.

259
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:42,200
I don't think
that's what she said.

260
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,330
You know what I think?

261
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,410
I think you're afraid.

262
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:50,870
You said that this morning.

263
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,130
And yet,

264
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:55,720
here I am.
Yes.

265
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,010
Here you are.

266
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:16,690
Will you jump?
Or not?

267
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:21,570
These men know
what they're doing?

268
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:22,740
Wrong question.

269
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,710
Whether or not
the cable is attached,

270
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,840
that is the question.

271
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,040
And the answer?

272
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,420
Xin ren.

273
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:45,180
Xin ren
means trust. To have faith.

274
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:48,810
Here, in this army,

275
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,100
we fight for more
than food or money.

276
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:54,650
We give our lives
to something more.

277
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:58,940
Xin ren is our flag.

278
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,330
Trust in each other.

279
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:05,450
In all ways, at all times.

280
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,220
Well, that's all well and good,
but I'm not jumping.

281
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:25,640
I'm alive today
because I trust no one.

282
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:28,970
A man must learn to trust

283
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:31,520
before he can be trusted.

284
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:33,610
Then you were right.

285
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,110
We're not the same.

286
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,960
My God!

287
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:54,380
A taste, a glimpse.

288
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:59,300
A few pilfered grains from Strategist
Wang's supply of black powder.

289
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:04,840
He's mastered the transmutation
of these elements.

290
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,300
People speak of a weapon.

291
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,180
There are many weapons here.

292
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:09,640
Why have we not seen them?

293
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:12,940
There are many
things you have not seen.

294
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:16,390
And many things you should
pray will not be needed

295
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:18,940
before the siege is through.

296
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:24,030
The Tao Tei will return.

297
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,580
When the drums call to battle,

298
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:31,160
the guards leave their posts and
take their positions on the Wall.

299
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,870
That is our moment.

300
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,250
We want to be riding away

301
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,710
as the battle rages.

302
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:43,920
And the armory doors?
You have keys?

303
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,840
I have black powder.

304
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,890
Enough for several doors.

305
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,890
He brings us in.
We get us out.

306
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,900
As you fought,
where was this stone?

307
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:01,400
In my bag.

308
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:05,270
Its unseen force is powerful.

309
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:08,740
I believe this strange
stone could help us.

310
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,540
We try everything.

311
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:15,910
Where are the Tao Tei now?

312
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:18,460
The mountains, regrouping.

313
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:21,710
Where do they come from?

314
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,420
About 20 centuries ago,

315
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:29,340
there was an emperor whose greed brought
deep suffering to all of China.

316
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,720
The heavens sent the meteor
that struck Gouwu Mountain,

317
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:36,140
turning it green
and releasing the Tao Tei.

318
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,230
From that day on, the Tao
Tei rise every 60 years

319
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:43,150
to scourge the north of China.

320
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:48,940
They come to remind us of what
happens when greed is unchecked.

321
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:52,610
They eat anything,
alive or dead,

322
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:54,910
and take food to their queen.

323
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:58,290
She depends on her
soldiers to feed her.

324
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:03,170
Only with the food they provide
is she able to multiply.

325
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:10,510
The capital, and its two million
people, is only 800 li away.

326
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,350
If the Tao Tei ever had
that much nourishment,

327
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,810
no corner of the world
would be safe.

328
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,820
You can't hunt them?

329
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,180
Men try.

330
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:22,690
They disappear.

331
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,560
We never find their bones.

332
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:16,300
This is envoy
Shen from the palace.

333
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,860
He has brought important records
to help with the coming battle.

334
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:26,450
A 900-year-old
battle report.

335
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,560
At the Hansha gates,

336
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:32,710
three beasts mounted the Wall.

337
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:36,630
They killed many men
as they went forward.

338
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,390
Then, by the grace
of the ancient gods,

339
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,800
the beasts stopped...

340
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:48,970
and sat peacefully
as we slaughtered them.

341
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:56,650
At the Hansha Gate,
was a magnet just like this one.

342
00:44:56,740 --> 00:45:01,450
I believe that magnet was the
reason that two of you Westerners

343
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:03,620
killed the Tao Tei so easily.

344
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:08,040
I believe the magnet
makes the Tao Tei deaf.

345
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:11,580
Without instruction,
they fall still.

346
00:45:15,970 --> 00:45:17,210
How can we be sure?

347
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:19,920
Why not try it?

348
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:22,680
Capture a Tao Tei.

349
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:24,010
See if it works.

350
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:27,690
How?

351
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:29,800
No net is strong enough.

352
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:32,100
Hunt them.
Like a whale.

353
00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:34,270
You know what that is.

354
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,400
Uh... A water beast.

355
00:45:36,030 --> 00:45:39,190
Hundred times
the size of a Tao Tei.

356
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:43,370
A spear that grabs.
Hook the bone. Pull them up.

357
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,740
I've seen it done in Spain.

358
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:56,710
What the hell are you doing?

359
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,480
We need to be free
when the attack comes.

360
00:45:58,510 --> 00:46:00,150
How many chances do you
think we will get?

361
00:46:02,810 --> 00:46:06,300
Be injured. Be missing.
Be a coward.

362
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:08,010
Get out of this.

363
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:10,560
We did enough.

364
00:48:04,010 --> 00:48:05,070
He'll be here.

365
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:07,260
When?
When it's over?

366
00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:09,090
We start and he will find us.

367
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:10,220
Start?

368
00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:12,010
We're jumping off a cliff here.

369
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:16,020
I have everything.
Powder, tools, maps.

370
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:18,180
It's all hidden and
arranged along the route.

371
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:19,600
Once we start,

372
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:22,230
there's no going back.

373
00:50:06,590 --> 00:50:08,420
I'll find him.
Forget him.

374
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:11,300
He'd rather die trying to
impress the new general

375
00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:16,090
than grab the key to every counting
room and brothel in the world.

376
00:50:16,770 --> 00:50:18,800
Good God, man.
The time is now!

377
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:20,600
I can't go without him.

378
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:22,090
More the spoils for us!

379
00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:24,180
We need his bow!

380
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:50,100
No, no, no. Stop!

381
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,550
There's too much tension.

382
00:51:51,570 --> 00:51:53,030
Chain will break.

383
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:54,690
That way. That way.

384
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:56,060
Let him run!

385
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,440
Stop! Stop!

386
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:03,910
We need longer for the
sleeping potion to work.

387
00:52:08,590 --> 00:52:09,590
That way. That way.

388
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:14,120
We need to isolate it.
Separate it from the others.

389
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:34,860
The chain won't hold much longer!

390
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:46,310
William, wait.

391
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:53,170
These arrows will
scream as the Tao Tei run.

392
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:55,790
Aim for the sound.

393
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:23,460
I'm only saving
you so I can kill you myself.

394
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:27,260
Grab an ax,
we're fighting blind.

395
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:38,900
Not yet.
I know what to do!

396
00:55:09,230 --> 00:55:10,510
The fire's not
holding them back.

397
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:12,430
Die well, brother.

398
00:55:19,530 --> 00:55:20,690
What the hell are you doing?

399
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:21,940
She's listening.

400
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:04,540
Did it work?

401
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:07,220
Yes. The beast
was captured.

402
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:10,250
My friend...

403
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:12,220
He was unharmed.

404
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:25,230
Why did you go over the Wall?

405
00:57:33,330 --> 00:57:34,910
Did I say it right?

406
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,240
Thank you.

407
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:48,510
Black powder.

408
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:52,260
It is a terrible weapon.

409
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:56,930
It would be better if
you had never seen it.

410
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:04,400
I know very little
of the outside world.

411
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:06,560
But it seems to me,

412
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:10,110
the greed of men is not that
different from the Tao Tei.

413
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,610
Is that true?

414
00:58:13,950 --> 00:58:16,570
The strong take what they want.

415
00:58:27,550 --> 00:58:29,960
Forget what you have seen.

416
00:59:52,430 --> 00:59:53,460
Hmm?

417
00:59:54,510 --> 00:59:56,390
You're much
braver than they think.

418
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:26,660
You wounded?

419
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:31,090
I was looking for you.

420
01:00:32,010 --> 01:00:33,170
To say thank you.

421
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:40,750
You feel good, huh?

422
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:44,180
Maybe you sing
a little song, eh?

423
01:00:45,310 --> 01:00:46,970
I will join you.

424
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:50,270
We can sing together how you
saved the grateful chinos.

425
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,810
You saw what happened out there
and that's what you say?

426
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:54,020
I see black powder.

427
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:57,100
I see a man forget his friends.

428
01:00:57,780 --> 01:00:59,740
The black powder's
not going anywhere.

429
01:00:59,830 --> 01:01:01,910
What goes nowhere is you.

430
01:01:05,710 --> 01:01:07,990
You'll never get
what you want from this.

431
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,460
You think they see you
as some kind of hero?

432
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:13,630
A man of virtue?

433
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:16,540
Maybe you can fool them,

434
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:18,630
but I know what you are.

435
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:22,300
You know what you are.

436
01:01:23,230 --> 01:01:24,680
A thief,

437
01:01:25,270 --> 01:01:26,600
a liar,

438
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:30,310
and a killer.

439
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:35,400
And you can never undo
the things you have done,

440
01:01:35,990 --> 01:01:37,190
and you will never be anything.

441
01:01:45,870 --> 01:01:47,490
Good to see you again, amigo.

442
01:02:08,690 --> 01:02:10,470
Nothing?
No.

443
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:11,870
How do you know
he won't betray us?

444
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:13,010
I don't.

445
01:02:13,110 --> 01:02:14,920
They'll kill him.
They'll kill him no matter what.

446
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:16,900
The time they spend killing him

447
01:02:18,030 --> 01:02:20,190
is time they are not chasing us.

448
01:03:02,370 --> 01:03:05,400
Careful with that.
There's powder here.

449
01:03:17,590 --> 01:03:19,080
Tovar.

450
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:21,150
Have a look.
See if it's gone out.

451
01:04:21,530 --> 01:04:22,640
Is it safe?

452
01:04:22,820 --> 01:04:24,310
Of course it is.

453
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:55,550
Shake it off, man.
To work.

454
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:01,230
I thought you said it was safe?

455
01:05:02,150 --> 01:05:03,730
We're in, aren't we?

456
01:05:15,580 --> 01:05:16,950
You're here.

457
01:05:17,540 --> 01:05:19,080
We've come to our senses, eh?

458
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:20,990
Ballard has planned well.

459
01:05:21,090 --> 01:05:22,950
Getting out is easy.

460
01:05:23,050 --> 01:05:25,380
There's a gate.
20 miles west.

461
01:05:25,550 --> 01:05:27,380
We dodge the hill tribes.

462
01:05:28,550 --> 01:05:29,550
We can make it.

463
01:05:30,930 --> 01:05:32,050
They need us here.

464
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:33,930
They need more than us.

465
01:05:34,890 --> 01:05:36,220
These people are doomed.

466
01:05:36,350 --> 01:05:37,390
Don't be a fool.

467
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:38,520
I've been a fool.

468
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:40,300
I'm done with it.

469
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:42,230
Brother, please.

470
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:45,390
We've been fighting for nothing.

471
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:47,520
For greed.

472
01:05:48,070 --> 01:05:51,280
Amigo, after all the blood,

473
01:05:51,370 --> 01:05:53,860
and cold, and pain,

474
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,360
with this black powder
in our saddle bags,

475
01:05:56,460 --> 01:05:57,950
we win.

476
01:05:59,250 --> 01:06:00,460
You come with me.

477
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:03,490
I can't do that now.

478
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:06,750
Stay and fight.

479
01:06:08,180 --> 01:06:09,420
William...

480
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:15,050
Think he's dead?

481
01:06:15,140 --> 01:06:17,180
It'd take a lot more than that.

482
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:10,480
Come on.

483
01:07:10,990 --> 01:07:12,020
Hyah.

484
01:08:35,410 --> 01:08:38,240
I tried to stop them...
You dare to speak to me?

485
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:41,480
I didn't do this.

486
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:45,070
And you came here to trade.

487
01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:47,080
And you knew nothing
of black powder.

488
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:51,710
What a fool you must think I am.

489
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:54,040
If I was with them,
why would I be here?

490
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:55,370
I tried to stop them.
I tried...

491
01:08:57,930 --> 01:08:59,290
You lie.

492
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:03,060
Some part of you knows
that's not true.

493
01:09:03,140 --> 01:09:08,060
If I were not the General,
I would kill you myself.

494
01:10:27,270 --> 01:10:29,010
Which way, left or right?

495
01:10:29,690 --> 01:10:32,470
Go up and take a look
from the high ground.

496
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:46,030
Hyah!

497
01:10:47,370 --> 01:10:48,450
No!

498
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:51,530
No! Bastard!

499
01:12:12,830 --> 01:12:14,230
What happened?

500
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:18,410
What happened?

501
01:12:18,550 --> 01:12:20,380
We have failed.

502
01:12:20,550 --> 01:12:22,960
The Tao Tei are in the Kingdom.

503
01:12:23,550 --> 01:12:26,960
You are free to leave.
Take what you wish and go.

504
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:29,130
This was the
General's final order.

505
01:12:29,270 --> 01:12:30,430
Where is she?

506
01:12:35,020 --> 01:12:36,430
To do what?

507
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:37,640
To fight?

508
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:39,060
Is there a chance?

509
01:12:39,190 --> 01:12:40,310
There's only one.

510
01:12:40,820 --> 01:12:42,810
Kill the Queen.

511
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:45,070
Kill the Queen, or we all die.

512
01:12:46,910 --> 01:12:47,990
Leave.

513
01:12:48,580 --> 01:12:50,660
Tell the world
what you have seen,

514
01:12:50,750 --> 01:12:52,910
and tell them what is coming.

515
01:13:15,940 --> 01:13:17,550
I'll need my bow.

516
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:23,850
If I'm to join you,
I'll need my bow.

517
01:13:35,410 --> 01:13:37,450
He wishes to join us.

518
01:15:31,950 --> 01:15:32,980
No.

519
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:34,070
No.

520
01:15:38,750 --> 01:15:39,750
No.

521
01:15:44,630 --> 01:15:45,630
No.

522
01:15:47,170 --> 01:15:50,160
No, don't throw
that thing near fire!

523
01:17:09,420 --> 01:17:10,790
Above you!

524
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:26,600
Behind you!

525
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:40,780
I set you free.

526
01:17:41,790 --> 01:17:43,120
And here I am.

527
01:17:44,830 --> 01:17:45,950
There's the Queen!

528
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:53,330
They will not attack
while the Queen is feeding.

529
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:55,380
We have a chance!

530
01:17:55,470 --> 01:17:56,550
Hold on!

531
01:19:18,550 --> 01:19:20,430
There is
an underground canal here.

532
01:19:20,550 --> 01:19:22,380
Has it been breached?

533
01:19:22,470 --> 01:19:23,990
The Tao Tei should
all be above ground.

534
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:25,890
And the one we captured?

535
01:19:26,390 --> 01:19:27,590
We load it up.

536
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:29,850
We feed it.

537
01:19:29,940 --> 01:19:31,890
And it will return to its Queen.

538
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:33,100
Good.

539
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:44,590
You'll have one hell of
a scar, but you'll live.

540
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:49,420
We'll come back for him.

541
01:21:07,450 --> 01:21:08,910
They've broken through!

542
01:22:31,410 --> 01:22:34,020
Patience, William.

543
01:22:51,010 --> 01:22:54,090
And it will go to the
Queen when it's done?

544
01:22:54,350 --> 01:22:55,550
It should.

545
01:22:58,100 --> 01:22:59,140
It will.

546
01:23:11,110 --> 01:23:12,110
Let it in.

547
01:23:36,180 --> 01:23:37,470
I can get a shot from above.

548
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:44,810
Go! I'll hold them back.

549
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:09,330
Wait. Not yet.

550
01:24:17,930 --> 01:24:19,010
Hit.

551
01:24:28,190 --> 01:24:29,190
Go higher.

552
01:24:29,230 --> 01:24:30,690
I'll get a better shot.

553
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,000
General!

554
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:46,370
It's up to you now!

555
01:25:39,260 --> 01:25:40,880
We have one black
powder weapon left.

556
01:25:40,970 --> 01:25:42,430
Give me the spear.

557
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:46,060
I've trained for
this my whole life.

558
01:25:53,110 --> 01:25:54,470
I'll get you the shot.

559
01:26:40,370 --> 01:26:41,650
I've got you.

560
01:27:59,570 --> 01:28:01,650
So, how's life without me?

561
01:28:02,910 --> 01:28:04,320
A little slow.

562
01:28:07,580 --> 01:28:09,190
You're a hero after all.

563
01:28:09,750 --> 01:28:10,990
Well, it looks that way.

564
01:28:11,080 --> 01:28:13,410
You seem pleased with yourself.

565
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:15,910
And what are they giving you
for all of your troubles?

566
01:28:16,090 --> 01:28:17,090
A bag of gold?

567
01:28:17,670 --> 01:28:19,830
A victory parade
along the top of the Wall?

568
01:28:20,420 --> 01:28:22,330
All the black powder
I can carry.

569
01:28:22,930 --> 01:28:25,630
And a cavalry escort
to get me home safely.

570
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:28,090
Well, congratulations.

571
01:28:28,180 --> 01:28:30,010
Thank you.

572
01:28:30,100 --> 01:28:33,390
So what is this? You're
here to rub my nose in it?

573
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:35,010
Well, would you blame me?

574
01:28:35,110 --> 01:28:37,470
The last time I saw you,
you left me for dead.

575
01:28:37,610 --> 01:28:39,520
And the time before that,
I saved your life.

576
01:28:39,610 --> 01:28:40,940
True.

577
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:45,860
You know, the Emperor
gave me a choice.

578
01:28:45,950 --> 01:28:48,160
I could take the black powder,

579
01:28:48,330 --> 01:28:50,660
or I could take you.

580
01:28:52,500 --> 01:28:54,450
Please tell me
you chose the powder?

581
01:29:01,720 --> 01:29:03,420
I don't even know you anymore.

582
01:29:06,140 --> 01:29:07,750
The horses are
saddled and waiting.

583
01:29:07,850 --> 01:29:10,130
Best we ride before nightfall.

584
01:29:15,650 --> 01:29:17,310
I'll be inside.

585
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:19,260
Don't leave without me.

586
01:29:29,990 --> 01:29:31,150
I came to say goodbye.

587
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:36,740
I understand congratulations
are in order.

588
01:29:36,920 --> 01:29:39,160
General of the
northwest territory.

589
01:29:39,340 --> 01:29:41,000
That's quite an honor.

590
01:29:43,510 --> 01:29:45,620
Seems you've made your choice.

591
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:46,840
Him?

592
01:29:47,010 --> 01:29:49,880
Believe me, I'm already thinking about
trading him back for the powder.

593
01:29:50,060 --> 01:29:52,010
I heard that.

594
01:29:57,690 --> 01:30:00,800
Perhaps we were both wrong.

595
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:04,020
We are more similar
than I thought.

596
01:30:09,700 --> 01:30:11,410
Thank you, General.

597
01:30:37,350 --> 01:30:39,390
Are you sure you don't
want to go back?

598
01:30:40,060 --> 01:30:41,060
Of course I do.

599
01:30:42,230 --> 01:30:44,720
I just don't trust you to
make it out of here alone.
