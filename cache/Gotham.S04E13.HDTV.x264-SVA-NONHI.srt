1
00:00:00,234 --> 00:00:02,601
<i>Previously on "Gotham"...</i>

2
00:00:02,796 --> 00:00:05,483
I'm arresting you
for the murder of the boy you blew up

3
00:00:05,508 --> 00:00:06,882
under the Crown Point Bridge.

4
00:00:06,914 --> 00:00:09,282
And how can <i>you</i> help me?

5
00:00:09,317 --> 00:00:12,264
What do you say, pal? Give me a smile.

6
00:00:13,801 --> 00:00:15,400
I'm not who my parents might've

7
00:00:15,436 --> 00:00:17,336
wanted me to be, and I'm okay with that.

8
00:00:17,371 --> 00:00:18,770
I'm not okay with it.

9
00:00:18,806 --> 00:00:20,272
I went to my lawyer and him draw up

10
00:00:20,307 --> 00:00:21,620
emancipation papers.

11
00:00:21,709 --> 00:00:22,841
Alfred, you're fired.

12
00:00:22,876 --> 00:00:24,543
Now get the hell out of my house.

13
00:00:24,578 --> 00:00:26,278
I am in control!

14
00:00:26,313 --> 00:00:27,679
But why would you want that?

15
00:00:27,715 --> 00:00:29,748
We had so much fun when we were me.

16
00:00:30,985 --> 00:00:32,951
Surprise.

17
00:00:32,987 --> 00:00:34,720
I needed the police to turn on Penguin.

18
00:00:34,755 --> 00:00:37,122
So you sent this monster to my city.

19
00:00:40,294 --> 00:00:42,127
I need you at the head of the GCPD.

20
00:00:42,162 --> 00:00:43,695
Let them think you're a hero.

21
00:00:43,731 --> 00:00:45,297
This is Gordon.

22
00:00:45,332 --> 00:00:47,966
I just shot and killed the Pyg.

23
00:00:48,002 --> 00:00:49,101
Ivy?

24
00:00:51,171 --> 00:00:52,971
What happened to you?

25
00:00:53,007 --> 00:00:54,273
I've been reborn.

26
00:00:56,844 --> 00:00:57,876
And I will never

27
00:00:57,911 --> 00:00:59,478
be underestimated or ignored

28
00:00:59,513 --> 00:01:00,612
ever again.

29
00:01:00,648 --> 00:01:03,181
Let's make Gotham our bitch.

30
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:23,236
Can I help you?

31
00:01:28,777 --> 00:01:31,663
You're so beautiful.

32
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:34,748
Thanks. Now move.

33
00:01:37,953 --> 00:01:39,412
Hey, Dad, let me tell you
what happened at school.

34
00:01:39,459 --> 00:01:40,551
Oh, my God, you're gonna love this.

35
00:01:40,576 --> 00:01:42,021
- Mm-hmm.
- Can I just tell him, please?

36
00:01:42,057 --> 00:01:43,123
Wait, no, can I tell him?

37
00:01:43,158 --> 00:01:44,190
- Just let me tell him.
- Nice score.

38
00:01:44,226 --> 00:01:46,626
Cindy? Who are these...

39
00:01:50,932 --> 00:01:52,929
Well,

40
00:01:53,101 --> 00:01:55,935
what a charming young lady.

41
00:01:55,971 --> 00:01:57,404
She's so beautiful, Mom.

42
00:01:57,743 --> 00:01:59,009
And cool.

43
00:01:59,072 --> 00:02:03,367
So your perfume turns people
into your superfans?

44
00:02:03,404 --> 00:02:05,170
Like all good things, it'll fade.

45
00:02:05,213 --> 00:02:06,212
But until then,

46
00:02:06,248 --> 00:02:07,447
they're mine.

47
00:02:08,417 --> 00:02:09,883
Freeze.

48
00:02:24,674 --> 00:02:26,307
Not bad.

49
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:28,635
I'll check out the rest of the house.

50
00:02:36,912 --> 00:02:40,079
My friend thinks we're here to rob you,

51
00:02:40,115 --> 00:02:44,017
but I know who you work for,
Roland Charles, PhD.

52
00:02:47,656 --> 00:02:51,925
How you... torture plants

53
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,407
in the name of science.

54
00:03:05,807 --> 00:03:07,273
Do you ever wonder

55
00:03:07,309 --> 00:03:08,608
how those plants feel?

56
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,837
Soon, you'll share more with them...

57
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,894
...than you ever could've imagined.

58
00:03:36,499 --> 00:03:39,171
What did you do to him?

59
00:03:39,674 --> 00:03:41,674
I gave him what he deserves.

60
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:02,536

61
00:04:03,565 --> 00:04:06,299
Captain. Captain Gordon.

62
00:04:06,334 --> 00:04:07,700
Yoo-hoo!

63
00:04:07,736 --> 00:04:10,336
Captain. Captain Gordon.

64
00:04:10,372 --> 00:04:13,373
- Chaz Carmichael.
- Congratulations.

65
00:04:13,408 --> 00:04:15,174
Boss ain't gonna be happy I'm in here.

66
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:16,843
Let's say I got a lot of responsibility

67
00:04:16,878 --> 00:04:18,105
in my organization.

68
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:20,317
Yeah, you seem like
a real responsible guy.

69
00:04:20,415 --> 00:04:23,426
My boss is Sofia Falcone.

70
00:04:28,456 --> 00:04:30,707
Oh, yeah? What's that got to do with me?

71
00:04:30,754 --> 00:04:31,871
Easy.

72
00:04:31,949 --> 00:04:33,973
All I know is she told me
if I ever got pinched,

73
00:04:34,059 --> 00:04:35,528
to tell you to give her a call.

74
00:04:37,552 --> 00:04:38,851
- Is that so?
- You can't do this.

75
00:04:38,876 --> 00:04:39,899
I got rights.

76
00:04:39,935 --> 00:04:40,967
Oh, yeah? How about you exercise

77
00:04:41,002 --> 00:04:42,955
your right to remain silent.

78
00:04:43,206 --> 00:04:45,340
Hey, Cap.

79
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,106
Got something.

80
00:04:47,142 --> 00:04:49,208
Victim was Roland Charles.

81
00:04:49,244 --> 00:04:51,800
Ran R&D, Wayne Enterprises, Biotech.

82
00:04:51,847 --> 00:04:53,546
Did you know him from
when you worked at Wayne?

83
00:04:53,582 --> 00:04:55,014
I'd met him in passing.

84
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:56,549
Not that I recognized him right away.

85
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,221
It's like the tweaker
we found last week.

86
00:05:01,623 --> 00:05:03,957
The toxin entered the bloodstream
through the cuts on the neck.

87
00:05:03,992 --> 00:05:05,858
If it is the same as the last victim,

88
00:05:05,894 --> 00:05:07,602
the toxin creates vines that feed off of

89
00:05:07,649 --> 00:05:09,682
the victim's body, while also
attacking the hippocampus,

90
00:05:09,717 --> 00:05:12,477
like some plant-based psychedelics.

91
00:05:12,502 --> 00:05:14,654
So it kills you
and makes you hallucinate.

92
00:05:15,863 --> 00:05:17,698
Any witnesses?

93
00:05:17,792 --> 00:05:19,659
The family's saying
that it was two women,

94
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,661
a redhead and a brunette.
The redhead used

95
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:23,362
some kind of hypnosis on them,

96
00:05:23,398 --> 00:05:25,097
and the brunette wore a leather whip.

97
00:05:25,133 --> 00:05:27,033
Selina Kyle?

98
00:05:27,068 --> 00:05:30,436
Murder's not really her thing.
The family says

99
00:05:30,471 --> 00:05:32,089
the redhead killed Roland.

100
00:05:32,144 --> 00:05:33,305
She left with his briefcase.

101
00:05:34,191 --> 00:05:36,335
Well, if his briefcase is missing,

102
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,860
maybe this is related
to his work at Wayne Biotech?

103
00:05:38,885 --> 00:05:39,799
Doubtful.

104
00:05:39,824 --> 00:05:44,251
He oversaw standard projects:
pharmaceuticals, pesticides...

105
00:05:45,618 --> 00:05:48,087
- What?
- Nothing.

106
00:05:49,321 --> 00:05:51,357
I'll track down Selina.

107
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,200
<i>This is Bruce. Leave a message.</i>

108
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:04,537
Bruce, I know we
haven't talked in a while,

109
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:07,216
but someone just killed Roland Charles.

110
00:06:07,537 --> 00:06:09,482
We may have a problem.

111
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,648
Roland Charles asked for clearance

112
00:06:15,683 --> 00:06:19,051
for some top secret biotech experiment.

113
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,020
Project M.

114
00:06:21,055 --> 00:06:23,022
Ivy, you think I care about that?

115
00:06:23,057 --> 00:06:26,759
You just killed a man
in front of his family.

116
00:06:27,003 --> 00:06:29,662
He had it coming. You have no idea

117
00:06:29,697 --> 00:06:31,230
what these people do.

118
00:06:33,524 --> 00:06:36,626
We need to find out everything
we can about Project M.

119
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,776
And whatever it is,

120
00:06:38,822 --> 00:06:41,407
all access would have
had to have been approved

121
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:44,778
- by Bruce Wayne.
- You know, I-I-I really thought

122
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:48,047
that doing a crime spree
with you would be fun,

123
00:06:48,082 --> 00:06:50,971
but... I was wrong.

124
00:06:51,219 --> 00:06:52,351
Selina!

125
00:06:52,386 --> 00:06:53,953
Leave me alone.

126
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:57,089
Enjoy your shrubs.

127
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:07,600
We don't need her.

128
00:07:11,405 --> 00:07:14,640
Now let's show everyone
just how strong we are.

129
00:07:25,719 --> 00:07:29,539
Pour me another shot.
Pour me another shot.

130
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,060
Party time.

131
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,429
Party time.

132
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:39,524
Shut up.

133
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:42,802
Gonna throw up. Gonna throw up.

134
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,804
You know, I've had some crazy nights,

135
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,273
but I've never bought a talking bird.

136
00:07:48,976 --> 00:07:51,222
Sorry. Party's over.

137
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:52,812
I wasn't at the party.

138
00:07:55,817 --> 00:07:58,083
I've seen you before.

139
00:07:58,119 --> 00:08:00,886
At The Sirens. What are you...
What are you doing here?

140
00:08:04,292 --> 00:08:06,959
I'm here to speak for those

141
00:08:06,994 --> 00:08:08,759
who can't speak for themselves, Bruce.

142
00:08:08,816 --> 00:08:12,651
I'm here to speak for the plants.

143
00:08:12,733 --> 00:08:15,000
Okay.

144
00:08:15,788 --> 00:08:17,469
My head hurts.

145
00:08:17,757 --> 00:08:19,913
Please get out.

146
00:08:24,345 --> 00:08:26,097
First...

147
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,761
tell me about Project M.

148
00:08:31,768 --> 00:08:33,118
How do you know about that?

149
00:08:33,154 --> 00:08:36,661
Oh, I know a lot of things...

150
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:39,191
Billionaire Boy.

151
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:41,527
Ivy?

152
00:08:47,668 --> 00:08:49,887
You're so...

153
00:08:50,538 --> 00:08:52,176
beautiful.

154
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,073
Now, Project M.

155
00:09:02,116 --> 00:09:03,887
Next.

156
00:09:14,768 --> 00:09:16,528
Hey, there.

157
00:09:17,338 --> 00:09:18,660
Get him off...

158
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:35,576
Is this seat taken?

159
00:09:35,662 --> 00:09:37,449
If I say yes, will it make a difference?

160
00:09:37,485 --> 00:09:39,551
You know, I've always been a fan.

161
00:09:39,587 --> 00:09:41,253
When you got locked up

162
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,756
in this loony bin,
I expected great things.

163
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:47,295
A murder or two, maybe a...

164
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,154
prison break.

165
00:09:49,931 --> 00:09:54,633
But all you've done is mope
for the last six weeks.

166
00:09:58,434 --> 00:09:59,872
You must know, I cannot escape.

167
00:09:59,907 --> 00:10:01,240
Why?

168
00:10:02,343 --> 00:10:04,642
None of your business.

169
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:10,337
Because Sofia Falcone is holding
someone important to me captive,

170
00:10:10,384 --> 00:10:11,978
and if I escape, she will kill him.

171
00:10:12,017 --> 00:10:15,587
Wow, what a boring story.

172
00:10:15,623 --> 00:10:16,922
If there's one thing

173
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:20,299
I can't stand, it's someone boring.

174
00:10:22,096 --> 00:10:25,345
The last person
who bored me was Dietrich.

175
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,433
I had to sneak into his

176
00:10:27,468 --> 00:10:30,736
shock therapy session
and goose the juice.

177
00:10:30,771 --> 00:10:32,071
Now he pees himself

178
00:10:32,106 --> 00:10:33,996
ten times a day, and sometimes, uh...

179
00:10:36,889 --> 00:10:39,290
...poos himself.

180
00:10:42,979 --> 00:10:45,182
Well, that's very sad.

181
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:53,453
I'm gonna cure you
of this attitude, Oswald.

182
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:59,999
I'm gonna find that entertaining
guy I know is inside of you.

183
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:01,881
And when I do,

184
00:11:01,969 --> 00:11:03,435
ooh,

185
00:11:03,764 --> 00:11:07,606
we are gonna have so much fun together.

186
00:11:13,347 --> 00:11:15,848
That's quite a story.

187
00:11:17,091 --> 00:11:19,658
Not what I was expecting.

188
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,487
You're just so easy to talk to.

189
00:11:24,658 --> 00:11:25,991
Normally, I would make this quick,

190
00:11:26,027 --> 00:11:27,359
like I did with Roland,

191
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,695
but it's your name on the company

192
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,630
that murders my little green friends.

193
00:11:32,026 --> 00:11:34,768
I'm so sorry, Ivy.

194
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:37,369
I would never want to upset you.

195
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,505
But you have, Bruce.

196
00:11:42,043 --> 00:11:44,543
Hide out here all you want.

197
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:50,015
Bury your head in the sand.

198
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,753
You're still guilty.

199
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,029
It'll be slow.

200
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:10,836
And it'll be painful.

201
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:15,908
But it's what you deserve.

202
00:12:24,752 --> 00:12:28,153
I'm just sorry I won't be here
to see you bloom.

203
00:12:52,242 --> 00:12:54,104
No.

204
00:12:54,323 --> 00:12:55,610
No.

205
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:57,478
No.

206
00:12:57,513 --> 00:13:00,151
- None of these will do.
- Where's Ivy?

207
00:13:00,176 --> 00:13:01,208
What did she do to me?

208
00:13:01,255 --> 00:13:02,754
- Where am I?
- Ah.

209
00:13:04,676 --> 00:13:07,626
- Just the thing.
- Ra's al Ghul?

210
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:09,595
"Ra's al Ghul."

211
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:10,974
Nope. Never heard of him.

212
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:12,502
I'm Dr. Greenthumb.

213
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:14,592
Just here to do a little
light pruning, really.

214
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:17,068
No. No!

215
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:18,863
No!

216
00:13:22,222 --> 00:13:23,932
There.

217
00:13:24,315 --> 00:13:26,729
That's better.

218
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:30,374
Ah.

219
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:31,821
Mommy always used to say:

220
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:33,744
a little pruning encourages growth.

221
00:13:35,462 --> 00:13:37,229
Where are you taking that?

222
00:13:37,298 --> 00:13:38,482
Thanks, poppet.

223
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:40,284
Where are you taking my face?

224
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:42,086
Please.

225
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:44,255
What's happening to me?

226
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,534
My dear boy.

227
00:13:46,684 --> 00:13:48,869
You're dying.

228
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:51,262
Just hold still,
while I put these in place.

229
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:52,997
- No.
- Good Lord.

230
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:55,158
No!

231
00:14:06,817 --> 00:14:08,150
Jim.

232
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:09,613
What a pleasant surprise.

233
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:11,882
- I'm looking for Selina.
- Haven't seen her.

234
00:14:11,918 --> 00:14:14,012
She's more of an alley cat
than a house cat.

235
00:14:14,051 --> 00:14:16,173
- Now, I'm just in the middle of something.
- Let him in.

236
00:14:20,952 --> 00:14:22,503
Hello, James.

237
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,528
It's been a while.

238
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:27,556
Barbara, can you give us a moment?

239
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:29,633
Sure.

240
00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:31,669
Have fun, lovebirds.

241
00:14:37,364 --> 00:14:39,343
What is your business with Barbara Kean?

242
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:42,187
You're worried that I told her
about our arrangement?

243
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,763
I know how to keep a secret.

244
00:14:45,794 --> 00:14:47,826
Now, I want my man Carmichael released

245
00:14:47,861 --> 00:14:50,762
- from GCPD custody.
- That wasn't the deal.

246
00:14:50,797 --> 00:14:53,787
- You run the underworld.
- I run the GCPD.

247
00:14:53,818 --> 00:14:56,015
Your guy got arrested. That's on him.

248
00:14:56,101 --> 00:14:58,536
Let me make something clear.

249
00:14:58,788 --> 00:15:01,969
Our deal is whatever I say it is.

250
00:15:02,024 --> 00:15:03,891
Unless you want people to know

251
00:15:03,953 --> 00:15:06,044
you're responsible
for bringing the Pyg to town.

252
00:15:07,095 --> 00:15:09,849
You brought him to Gotham.
I was just trying to stop Penguin.

253
00:15:09,904 --> 00:15:13,302
But you covered it up and
took credit for killing him.

254
00:15:13,365 --> 00:15:15,039
Word gets out, you're destroyed.

255
00:15:15,075 --> 00:15:18,176
Along with your beloved GCPD.

256
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:22,949
And if I go down... so will you.

257
00:15:23,037 --> 00:15:25,749
And I think you like being
queen of the underworld.

258
00:15:25,821 --> 00:15:29,423
You still think you know
what I will and won't do.

259
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:31,258
I know a bluff when I see one.

260
00:15:34,997 --> 00:15:36,596
I have a job to do.

261
00:15:39,768 --> 00:15:41,549
Selina!

262
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:44,604
Oh, hey, Jim. I found Selina.
She went that way.

263
00:15:50,612 --> 00:15:52,579
No, no, no!

264
00:15:52,614 --> 00:15:54,504
Shut your beak.

265
00:15:54,692 --> 00:15:57,826
No! No. No. No...

266
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:09,996
- What do you want?
- I told you, Pengy.

267
00:16:10,032 --> 00:16:13,033
I'm gonna cure you
of this sad sack mopey act.

268
00:16:13,068 --> 00:16:14,935
And the best cure

269
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:17,734
is the laughing cure.

270
00:16:20,509 --> 00:16:21,975
Make me laugh.

271
00:16:22,304 --> 00:16:24,478
Make him laugh! Make him laugh!

272
00:16:24,513 --> 00:16:27,147
So, what'll you be performing?

273
00:16:27,182 --> 00:16:29,316
Uh, contortionism?

274
00:16:29,351 --> 00:16:31,151
Juggling act? A tight five?

275
00:16:31,186 --> 00:16:33,620
Oh, what's that?

276
00:16:34,513 --> 00:16:37,014
You want to do a clown dance?

277
00:16:37,201 --> 00:16:39,201
- Yeah!
- Wonderful.

278
00:16:41,864 --> 00:16:43,530
I will not!

279
00:16:44,533 --> 00:16:46,333
- Huh?
- No.

280
00:16:47,369 --> 00:16:49,669
Hands off... No!

281
00:16:49,705 --> 00:16:51,404
Make him laugh!

282
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,639
Make him laugh!

283
00:16:52,674 --> 00:16:55,375
Make him laugh! Make him laugh!

284
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:57,811
Make him laugh!

285
00:16:57,846 --> 00:16:59,546
- Ugh...
- In your own time.

286
00:17:03,185 --> 00:17:05,898
You have no idea how I've suffered.

287
00:17:06,023 --> 00:17:10,090
The betrayals I've endured.
Just... just leave me alone.

288
00:17:11,426 --> 00:17:13,226
- Leave me alone.
- Cut!

289
00:17:17,633 --> 00:17:19,032
Hey.

290
00:17:19,568 --> 00:17:22,123
Oswald, Oswald, Oswald.

291
00:17:22,178 --> 00:17:25,405
You are trapped in a prison.

292
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,674
In here.

293
00:17:27,912 --> 00:17:30,701
And I'm offering you the key.

294
00:17:30,746 --> 00:17:33,246
So... dance.

295
00:17:33,282 --> 00:17:37,250
Make him laugh! Make him laugh!
Make him laugh!

296
00:17:37,286 --> 00:17:39,619
Now we're talking.

297
00:17:39,655 --> 00:17:41,188
I can feel the funny coming.

298
00:17:41,223 --> 00:17:42,389
Here it comes!

299
00:17:42,424 --> 00:17:44,925
Here comes the funny. Okay.

300
00:17:49,932 --> 00:17:51,431
And you're down.

301
00:17:54,903 --> 00:17:56,703
Fred Astaire you are not.

302
00:17:58,807 --> 00:18:02,642
- We'll try again tomorrow.
- Come on!

303
00:18:20,028 --> 00:18:22,495
Ow! What the hell, man?

304
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:24,011
Why were you running, Selina?

305
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:25,839
'Cause a jerk with a badge
was chasing me.

306
00:18:25,868 --> 00:18:27,634
So not because you were
in Roland Charles's house

307
00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:29,603
last night when he was
turned into a tree?

308
00:18:29,801 --> 00:18:32,001
His family saw a redhead and a brunette.

309
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:34,380
The brunette was carrying a
leather whip just like yours.

310
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:35,871
Tell me I'm crazy.

311
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:38,812
I swear, I was only there
to rob the place.

312
00:18:38,847 --> 00:18:40,480
So what about the redhead?

313
00:18:40,515 --> 00:18:42,749
She killed some tweaker in
the Narrows the same way.

314
00:18:42,784 --> 00:18:44,417
I need a name.

315
00:18:44,453 --> 00:18:46,286
Ivy Pepper.

316
00:18:46,321 --> 00:18:48,455
Try again. I know Ivy.

317
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:50,023
No, Gordon, she's changed.

318
00:18:50,052 --> 00:18:51,785
Like, a lot.

319
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:54,361
She can use plants
to hypnotize people, and poison them.

320
00:18:55,146 --> 00:18:56,630
So why'd she want to kill Roland?

321
00:18:56,665 --> 00:18:58,365
'Cause he works for Wayne Enterprises.

322
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,860
- Wayne Enterprises.
- She's obsessed with this

323
00:19:00,885 --> 00:19:02,665
super secret project they're doing.

324
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:07,264
Lucius lied. Come on. Let's go.

325
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:15,648
Admiring my handiwork?

326
00:19:15,751 --> 00:19:17,484
Excuse me?

327
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:22,470
Look how beautiful he became.

328
00:19:24,726 --> 00:19:26,967
And all it took...

329
00:19:27,195 --> 00:19:30,030
was a little scratch.

330
00:19:30,499 --> 00:19:32,327
Oh...

331
00:19:32,668 --> 00:19:35,038
Well, what do you want from me?

332
00:19:35,085 --> 00:19:37,037
I want to know about Project M.

333
00:19:38,233 --> 00:19:40,307
- What is Project M?
- Mm-mm-mm.

334
00:19:40,342 --> 00:19:42,242
Bruce Wayne told me everything.

335
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:44,744
How he didn't even trust himself
with the location,

336
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,546
but that you know where it is.

337
00:19:48,617 --> 00:19:51,418
And you're going to take me to it.

338
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:57,310
But first,

339
00:19:57,888 --> 00:20:00,248
you probably want to tell me
I'm beautiful.

340
00:20:00,287 --> 00:20:01,428
Yeah.

341
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,259
Yes.

342
00:20:08,634 --> 00:20:10,307
Help!

343
00:20:11,225 --> 00:20:13,826
Help! Somebody help me!

344
00:20:31,415 --> 00:20:33,915
Jim. Jim, you need to help me.

345
00:20:33,955 --> 00:20:35,415
Ouch.

346
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:37,622
Looks like you cut yourself
shaving, old man.

347
00:20:37,657 --> 00:20:39,557
Jim, it's me, it's Bruce.

348
00:20:39,593 --> 00:20:41,459
I'm Bruce Wayne.

349
00:20:42,896 --> 00:20:46,097
Honey, I think we'd know
if you were Bruce Wayne.

350
00:20:46,132 --> 00:20:47,599
He's the one throwing this shindig.

351
00:20:47,634 --> 00:20:50,301
That's him yonder.

352
00:20:50,337 --> 00:20:52,604
Bruce, you're incorrigible.

353
00:20:52,639 --> 00:20:54,606
I may bust a gut.

354
00:20:54,641 --> 00:20:57,024
Luckily, I am a doctor.

355
00:20:57,244 --> 00:21:00,778
Ain't he the cat's pajamas?

356
00:21:01,204 --> 00:21:02,712
Come on.

357
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:07,884
Easy there, sport.

358
00:21:07,922 --> 00:21:10,155
- That's Italian velvet.
- What did you do?

359
00:21:10,194 --> 00:21:12,062
Where's Ra's al Ghul?

360
00:21:12,124 --> 00:21:13,653
Ra's al who?

361
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,683
That's my face. He gave you my face.

362
00:21:15,738 --> 00:21:16,823
That's my face!

363
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:18,825
Think you've been hitting the gin.

364
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:22,296
Give me back my face! I'm Bruce Wayne!

365
00:21:22,571 --> 00:21:26,094
Get off of me. You're ruining my fun.

366
00:21:28,274 --> 00:21:30,804
Everything all right, Master Bruce?

367
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:32,639
Yes, thank you.

368
00:21:32,674 --> 00:21:34,207
Just getting rid of the riffraff.

369
00:21:41,082 --> 00:21:42,449
Ha, ha!

370
00:21:43,363 --> 00:21:46,160
Dude, what is it with you
and the arm-grabbing?

371
00:21:46,199 --> 00:21:47,796
Harper. I need keys to lockup.

372
00:21:47,821 --> 00:21:49,052
- And is Lucius in his office?
- Let go.

373
00:21:49,087 --> 00:21:51,890
Lucius? No, he left with Ivy
a little while ago.

374
00:21:51,952 --> 00:21:53,156
Ivy Pepper?

375
00:21:53,191 --> 00:21:54,858
- She was here?
- Yeah.

376
00:21:54,893 --> 00:21:56,793
She asked me
to introduce her to everyone.

377
00:21:56,828 --> 00:21:58,461
Isn't she the coolest?

378
00:21:58,497 --> 00:21:59,863
She's a psycho

379
00:21:59,898 --> 00:22:01,821
who turned a guy into a potted plant.

380
00:22:01,891 --> 00:22:03,900
What's going on with you?

381
00:22:04,591 --> 00:22:06,860
Did he just say Ivy's a psycho?

382
00:22:07,274 --> 00:22:08,738
But Ivy's the best.

383
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:14,452
Is this the, uh, hypnosis
I've been hearing about?

384
00:22:14,477 --> 00:22:16,112
I'm gonna say yeah.

385
00:22:16,148 --> 00:22:18,715
And until it fades,
they'll do anything for her.

386
00:22:18,907 --> 00:22:20,977
And think she's the coolest.

387
00:22:23,321 --> 00:22:25,751
What do you mean by "Ivy's a psycho"?

388
00:22:25,791 --> 00:22:28,258
Hold that thought, Harper.

389
00:22:28,294 --> 00:22:29,993
We'll be right back.

390
00:22:30,431 --> 00:22:33,055
You hear what the captain
said about Ivy?

391
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,981
- But Ivy's awesome.
- Yeah, she is the coolest.

392
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,350
No more, no more!

393
00:22:48,495 --> 00:22:50,436
You have a visitor.

394
00:22:57,838 --> 00:22:59,867
Hello, Oswald.

395
00:23:01,351 --> 00:23:03,241
I see Arkham's treating you well.

396
00:23:05,512 --> 00:23:07,012
I take it you're here to gloat.

397
00:23:07,273 --> 00:23:08,947
You are correct.

398
00:23:09,983 --> 00:23:11,906
And why not?

399
00:23:12,186 --> 00:23:14,686
I am in an insane asylum.

400
00:23:15,956 --> 00:23:18,490
Being pummeled by lunatics.

401
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:23,261
Then again, at least I'm not a moron.

402
00:23:25,332 --> 00:23:27,836
I may not be the man I once was.

403
00:23:28,852 --> 00:23:30,860
But I have many things
that you do not have.

404
00:23:30,904 --> 00:23:32,971
A purpose.

405
00:23:32,996 --> 00:23:34,272
Friends.

406
00:23:34,308 --> 00:23:35,507
You have neither of those.

407
00:23:36,007 --> 00:23:38,043
And I wanted you to see that.

408
00:23:42,186 --> 00:23:44,022
No.

409
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,183
I know you.

410
00:23:46,256 --> 00:23:48,639
There's something else going on.

411
00:23:48,784 --> 00:23:50,417
Something else brought you here.

412
00:23:52,726 --> 00:23:54,392
There's nothing else.

413
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:57,062
I wanted you to see how well

414
00:23:57,097 --> 00:23:58,263
I am doing.

415
00:23:58,298 --> 00:24:00,332
And I wanted to see
how miserable you are.

416
00:24:00,367 --> 00:24:02,834
Mission accomplished.

417
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:04,489
Ed.

418
00:24:05,272 --> 00:24:06,805
I'm gonna be out of here soon.

419
00:24:07,246 --> 00:24:09,207
And once I am,

420
00:24:09,243 --> 00:24:14,713
I am going to wipe that smile

421
00:24:14,748 --> 00:24:16,236
off of your face.

422
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:18,110
Preferably with a chain saw.

423
00:24:18,185 --> 00:24:19,384
Ow.

424
00:24:19,419 --> 00:24:21,153
How are you gonna do that?

425
00:24:21,188 --> 00:24:23,255
You have no friends.

426
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:25,472
No one to help you escape.

427
00:24:26,066 --> 00:24:28,394
You are utterly alone.

428
00:24:30,731 --> 00:24:32,564
Good-bye, Oswald.

429
00:24:34,301 --> 00:24:35,500
Sorry,

430
00:24:35,536 --> 00:24:38,003
but I don't put too much stock

431
00:24:38,038 --> 00:24:40,939
in the opinions of simpletons!

432
00:24:55,289 --> 00:24:57,189
"I am held captive all day.

433
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,212
"My brilliance locked away.

434
00:24:59,326 --> 00:25:01,274
"This prison must be broken.

435
00:25:01,395 --> 00:25:03,173
"The key?

436
00:25:05,399 --> 00:25:07,299
My name, which must be spoken."

437
00:25:12,168 --> 00:25:14,401
You're still in there.

438
00:25:17,304 --> 00:25:19,442
That's why you came.

439
00:25:19,744 --> 00:25:22,112
You're still there.

440
00:25:22,249 --> 00:25:25,083
And you're gonna help me
find a way out of here.

441
00:25:25,118 --> 00:25:26,718
Hello?

442
00:25:26,753 --> 00:25:28,019
We should be leaving.

443
00:25:28,054 --> 00:25:30,378
Not until we find out
where Ivy took Lucius.

444
00:25:30,411 --> 00:25:32,078
There has to be something.

445
00:25:42,669 --> 00:25:45,103
<i>You know where it is and
you are going to take me to it.</i>

446
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:48,173
<i>Mmm. You're so incredible.</i>

447
00:25:48,208 --> 00:25:49,474
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

448
00:25:49,509 --> 00:25:51,943
<i>Where is Project M?</i>

449
00:25:51,979 --> 00:25:53,845
<i>Wayne Biotech has a secret facility</i>

450
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,231
<i>outside the city
at the edge of Kane Park.</i>

451
00:25:56,285 --> 00:25:58,519
Good man, Lucius.

452
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,325
In here.

453
00:26:01,121 --> 00:26:02,654
Hey, Cap.

454
00:26:02,689 --> 00:26:04,319
The boys and I were talking.

455
00:26:04,351 --> 00:26:05,721
And we didn't really like the way

456
00:26:05,746 --> 00:26:07,288
that you were talking about Ivy.

457
00:26:07,327 --> 00:26:09,343
I told you we should have left.

458
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:13,298
Look, I think you misinterpreted
what I was saying.

459
00:26:14,868 --> 00:26:16,434
You called Ivy a psycho.

460
00:26:16,837 --> 00:26:19,504
That's a term of endearment.

461
00:26:19,539 --> 00:26:21,626
I love Ivy. I think she's great.

462
00:26:21,742 --> 00:26:23,275
What about you?

463
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:24,476
Do you love Ivy?

464
00:26:24,511 --> 00:26:26,511
Yeah.

465
00:26:26,546 --> 00:26:28,346
I love Ivy.

466
00:26:29,314 --> 00:26:32,088
- How much?
- I love Ivy

467
00:26:32,158 --> 00:26:35,210
so much that I wish I could be her.

468
00:26:37,391 --> 00:26:38,823
You're not really selling it.

469
00:26:39,155 --> 00:26:40,659
And you think you did?

470
00:26:41,187 --> 00:26:42,794
Run.

471
00:26:42,829 --> 00:26:43,828
Get 'em!

472
00:26:46,109 --> 00:26:47,499
Selina!

473
00:26:49,915 --> 00:26:51,523
Break it down!

474
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:12,791
All right, Oswald, ole buddy, ole pal.

475
00:27:12,926 --> 00:27:15,326
Tonight we're gonna cure you.

476
00:27:15,385 --> 00:27:17,685
Make me laugh or else.

477
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:22,613
Let's call this the sudden death round.

478
00:27:27,703 --> 00:27:29,636
Dietrich?

479
00:27:40,768 --> 00:27:43,658
Okay, that was clever-ish.

480
00:27:47,386 --> 00:27:49,274
Yeah, that's a spoon.

481
00:27:49,597 --> 00:27:51,210
It is also a fork!

482
00:27:51,245 --> 00:27:53,245
Looks like you got some
fight in you still,

483
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,581
but it's just too little, too late,

484
00:27:55,616 --> 00:27:58,617
too... boring.

485
00:27:58,668 --> 00:28:00,652
Lobotomize the little bird.

486
00:28:00,894 --> 00:28:03,191
Wait, wait.

487
00:28:03,853 --> 00:28:07,822
You said this prison is all in my mind.

488
00:28:07,928 --> 00:28:11,523
Maybe I'm in a prison right now,

489
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:15,634
a prison where you can't get to me.

490
00:28:31,236 --> 00:28:33,329
Okay.

491
00:28:35,181 --> 00:28:37,456
You really are nuts.

492
00:28:47,361 --> 00:28:49,039
Clack!

493
00:28:49,638 --> 00:28:51,838
Clackety, clack, clack! Clack!

494
00:28:58,045 --> 00:28:59,278
Ah.

495
00:29:04,885 --> 00:29:06,652
- Thank you.
- Oh.

496
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:15,517
Oh, yeah!

497
00:29:23,771 --> 00:29:27,076
Try laughing now, you ginger sap!

498
00:29:27,241 --> 00:29:28,709
Yes!

499
00:29:38,786 --> 00:29:41,820
See? I told you I'd cure you.

500
00:29:41,856 --> 00:29:43,722
Don't flatter yourself!

501
00:29:43,757 --> 00:29:45,324
One more.

502
00:29:50,784 --> 00:29:52,364
And so, I said

503
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:54,333
to the guy...
you want to know what I said?

504
00:29:54,368 --> 00:29:56,428
I said, "What is this?

505
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:58,537
A three-ring circus?"

506
00:30:02,949 --> 00:30:04,916
And keep 'em coming.

507
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:14,933
How long do you think
you can hide in here?

508
00:30:15,589 --> 00:30:17,780
Look.

509
00:30:17,958 --> 00:30:19,725
Out there.

510
00:30:20,794 --> 00:30:23,553
He's going to find you eventually.

511
00:30:23,882 --> 00:30:25,882
I don't understand.

512
00:30:25,933 --> 00:30:27,699
Who's going to find me?

513
00:30:39,024 --> 00:30:40,352
Alfred?

514
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:43,196
Special Agent Pennyworth
to you, you scumbag.

515
00:30:43,235 --> 00:30:44,750
Package secured.

516
00:30:44,785 --> 00:30:48,016
- Requesting extraction.
- No!

517
00:30:55,062 --> 00:30:57,162
Just be careful in here.

518
00:30:57,198 --> 00:30:59,498
We're gonna go this way.

519
00:31:01,535 --> 00:31:03,388
This way.

520
00:31:07,808 --> 00:31:10,505
So, this is it.

521
00:31:10,738 --> 00:31:12,473
Project M.

522
00:31:15,449 --> 00:31:17,012
Also...

523
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,518
called Lazarus Water.

524
00:31:19,553 --> 00:31:21,787
It belonged to a man
known as Ra's al Ghul.

525
00:31:21,822 --> 00:31:24,886
It stimulates cell growth
at an alarming rate.

526
00:31:25,025 --> 00:31:27,597
We've yet to figure out how.

527
00:31:29,964 --> 00:31:31,863
I assumed Project M killed plants,

528
00:31:31,899 --> 00:31:33,932
but it's the opposite.

529
00:31:35,169 --> 00:31:36,535
Just like humans

530
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:38,786
to lock up something so beautiful.

531
00:31:39,073 --> 00:31:41,039
What are you going to do with it?

532
00:31:43,736 --> 00:31:46,393
I'm going to make miracles happen.

533
00:31:56,253 --> 00:31:58,320
Release me!

534
00:32:00,622 --> 00:32:02,293
Listen to me. I'm Bruce Wayne!

535
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,528
I can pay you whatever you want.

536
00:32:03,553 --> 00:32:05,083
You need to let me go now!

537
00:32:05,108 --> 00:32:07,004
Sorry, I can't do that, my old love.

538
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:08,520
You see, I have a mission.

539
00:32:08,536 --> 00:32:09,868
What mission?

540
00:32:09,904 --> 00:32:13,372
For me to bring you to him.

541
00:32:16,243 --> 00:32:17,910
What is that?

542
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,046
Well, giddyup, son.

543
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:44,286
What do you want?

544
00:32:44,371 --> 00:32:45,838
Why did you bring me here?

545
00:32:45,873 --> 00:32:47,673
This is where my parents were killed!

546
00:32:47,708 --> 00:32:49,508
No.

547
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:52,203
This is where I was born.

548
00:32:56,417 --> 00:32:57,555
No!

549
00:33:06,339 --> 00:33:07,779
That's far enough.

550
00:33:10,764 --> 00:33:12,464
Jim Gordon.

551
00:33:12,499 --> 00:33:13,599
Ivy Pepper?

552
00:33:13,634 --> 00:33:15,367
It's been a long time.

553
00:33:15,402 --> 00:33:18,203
I'm not the same kid you remember.

554
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,272
The kid whose father

555
00:33:20,307 --> 00:33:21,540
you and your partner killed,

556
00:33:21,575 --> 00:33:23,108
all those years ago.

557
00:33:24,835 --> 00:33:26,544
How is this possible?

558
00:33:26,575 --> 00:33:29,114
Well, first, I was a seed.

559
00:33:29,926 --> 00:33:32,217
Then a sprout.

560
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,519
Now I've bloomed.

561
00:33:35,438 --> 00:33:36,937
Drop your gun.

562
00:33:37,958 --> 00:33:39,424
- Or your friend Lucius...
- Hmm.

563
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:41,418
...becomes a flower arrangement.

564
00:33:50,572 --> 00:33:52,373
Lucius, you okay?

565
00:33:53,207 --> 00:33:55,807
I'm in the sweet embrace of one
of my favorite people, Jim.

566
00:33:55,843 --> 00:33:57,793
Never been better.

567
00:33:57,825 --> 00:33:59,693
Now, I know you're tenacious,

568
00:33:59,739 --> 00:34:01,380
Jim Gordon, gun or no gun.

569
00:34:01,567 --> 00:34:03,551
You'll come after me.

570
00:34:04,018 --> 00:34:07,653
But then... Bruce Wayne will die.

571
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,409
What have you done to him?

572
00:34:10,456 --> 00:34:13,003
I went to Wayne Manor
and planted a seed.

573
00:34:13,362 --> 00:34:15,727
I imagine he's about to bloom.

574
00:34:15,763 --> 00:34:17,095
But if you let me go,

575
00:34:18,462 --> 00:34:21,251
you may have a chance

576
00:34:21,353 --> 00:34:23,402
to get him the antidote.

577
00:34:27,775 --> 00:34:29,107
This isn't over.

578
00:34:29,143 --> 00:34:31,376
You have no idea how right you are.

579
00:34:32,713 --> 00:34:34,907
I love you.

580
00:34:35,649 --> 00:34:37,215
Lucius, give me the antidote.

581
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,619
Uh, let's just wait until
Ivy's at a safe distance.

582
00:34:40,654 --> 00:34:42,387
Give me the antidote. Come on.

583
00:34:43,295 --> 00:34:45,173
- Don't make me hit you.
- Jim.

584
00:34:45,225 --> 00:34:48,525
I must warn you,
I'm a black belt in jiu-jitsu.

585
00:34:48,595 --> 00:34:50,662
- Since when?
- Night classes.

586
00:34:58,272 --> 00:35:00,356
- The Lazarus Water.
- Come on.

587
00:35:00,402 --> 00:35:01,974
We got to get to Bruce Wayne.

588
00:35:02,009 --> 00:35:03,308
Let's go.

589
00:35:27,634 --> 00:35:29,568
Help!

590
00:35:31,138 --> 00:35:33,720
Somebody help!

591
00:35:35,609 --> 00:35:37,970
Who's there?

592
00:35:38,548 --> 00:35:40,512
Show yourself!

593
00:35:47,921 --> 00:35:49,888
Who are you?

594
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:54,706
I am the one you cannot escape.

595
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:58,124
The one you cannot kill.

596
00:36:00,718 --> 00:36:02,990
You're me.

597
00:36:03,737 --> 00:36:04,803
Please.

598
00:36:04,838 --> 00:36:07,739
You're scared. You should be.

599
00:36:13,781 --> 00:36:15,948
It's okay, Bruce. It's all right.

600
00:36:16,183 --> 00:36:18,050
You're safe now.

601
00:36:26,081 --> 00:36:27,738
According to Lucius,

602
00:36:27,816 --> 00:36:31,027
Ivy's toxin attacks the brain
like a hallucinogen.

603
00:36:31,702 --> 00:36:34,476
So, whatever you went through,

604
00:36:34,522 --> 00:36:35,941
I doubt it was pleasant.

605
00:36:36,024 --> 00:36:37,929
But it wasn't real.

606
00:36:39,202 --> 00:36:41,672
I think I saw who I really am.

607
00:36:44,366 --> 00:36:46,188
I know what you're gonna say,

608
00:36:46,368 --> 00:36:49,068
but what I saw... it was real.

609
00:36:51,695 --> 00:36:53,762
Well, then you're lucky.

610
00:36:54,025 --> 00:36:56,078
Most people go their whole lives
not ever knowing

611
00:36:56,111 --> 00:36:58,267
- who they really are.
- I'm not lucky.

612
00:36:58,713 --> 00:37:00,680
You didn't see it.

613
00:37:07,455 --> 00:37:09,422
I've seen my own darkness.

614
00:37:11,393 --> 00:37:12,969
I'll say this.

615
00:37:13,547 --> 00:37:16,792
You have people around you
who care for you.

616
00:37:18,363 --> 00:37:20,229
Don't fight this alone.

617
00:37:20,264 --> 00:37:21,731
Trust us.

618
00:37:24,035 --> 00:37:25,801
I'll leave men outside tonight.

619
00:37:26,306 --> 00:37:28,638
I'll come by tomorrow, check in on you.

620
00:37:30,408 --> 00:37:31,707
Jim?

621
00:37:33,778 --> 00:37:35,344
When I was under,

622
00:37:36,028 --> 00:37:37,505
I saw you.

623
00:37:38,929 --> 00:37:40,942
You had a moustache.

624
00:37:45,075 --> 00:37:47,189
Well, clearly,
that's a very dangerous toxin.

625
00:38:04,308 --> 00:38:06,199
Alfred, it's...

626
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:08,285
it's me, it's Bruce. I...

627
00:38:12,121 --> 00:38:14,528
I need your help, Alfred.

628
00:38:15,403 --> 00:38:16,981
Please call me.

629
00:38:31,048 --> 00:38:32,535
We're not hypnotized.

630
00:38:32,725 --> 00:38:33,915
Just embarrassed.

631
00:38:36,267 --> 00:38:37,963
Good to have you back.

632
00:38:38,943 --> 00:38:40,548
All right, listen up.

633
00:38:40,892 --> 00:38:43,548
I want an APB on Ivy Pepper.

634
00:38:43,595 --> 00:38:45,448
Finding her is our top priority.

635
00:38:45,483 --> 00:38:46,949
All right, you heard him, people.

636
00:38:46,984 --> 00:38:48,584
Let's get to work.

637
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:50,319
What do you want?

638
00:38:50,354 --> 00:38:51,921
<i>I thought about what you said.</i>

639
00:38:51,956 --> 00:38:53,789
How if I used the Pyg to destroy you,

640
00:38:53,825 --> 00:38:55,748
I'd also destroy myself.

641
00:38:55,773 --> 00:38:56,897
<i>And?</i>

642
00:38:57,224 --> 00:39:00,099
And... you're right.

643
00:39:00,298 --> 00:39:02,898
I've come to enjoy
being the queen of Gotham.

644
00:39:02,934 --> 00:39:04,166
Glad we understand each other.

645
00:39:04,202 --> 00:39:06,001
<i>Not quite. You see, I also realized</i>

646
00:39:06,037 --> 00:39:07,337
<i>I don't need the Pyg.</i>

647
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,941
There are other ways for me to hurt you.

648
00:39:19,494 --> 00:39:21,197
Thank you so much for coming.

649
00:39:21,479 --> 00:39:23,596
I thought we were overdue for a chat.

650
00:39:23,737 --> 00:39:25,855
How could I say no to my sister-in-law?

651
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,604
So I strangled him with his lower...

652
00:39:45,118 --> 00:39:47,190
Relax, buddy.

653
00:39:47,411 --> 00:39:49,044
You gave me what I needed.

654
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,380
The laugh of the century.

655
00:39:52,717 --> 00:39:54,483
Ah.

656
00:39:56,187 --> 00:39:57,925
Tell me something.

657
00:39:58,189 --> 00:40:00,604
You appear to have everyone here
under your thumb.

658
00:40:00,644 --> 00:40:02,358
The guards, the inmates.

659
00:40:02,393 --> 00:40:05,161
What can I say? I'm a charismatic guy.

660
00:40:07,263 --> 00:40:09,031
You could escape anytime.

661
00:40:09,066 --> 00:40:10,299
Why stay?

662
00:40:10,334 --> 00:40:11,997
Hmm.

663
00:40:12,503 --> 00:40:14,170
Why indeed?

664
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,573
You're planning something.

665
00:40:17,608 --> 00:40:19,708
Righty-o, old boy.

666
00:40:19,919 --> 00:40:22,004
Something...

667
00:40:22,413 --> 00:40:25,080
spectacular.

668
00:40:25,262 --> 00:40:27,583
See, I'm in this funny farm
'cause I need to find

669
00:40:27,618 --> 00:40:29,910
the crème de la crazy.

670
00:40:33,891 --> 00:40:36,225
Which is why I need you.

671
00:40:43,935 --> 00:40:45,568
Ah, you get it.

672
00:40:45,603 --> 00:40:48,070
But when we're done,

673
00:40:48,105 --> 00:40:50,551
the world out there...

674
00:40:50,731 --> 00:40:53,301
that'll be the asylum.

675
00:40:53,744 --> 00:40:55,411
What do you say?

676
00:40:57,593 --> 00:41:00,027
Thank you for your kind offer.

677
00:41:00,085 --> 00:41:01,894
Mm-hmm.

678
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,521
I don't expect to be here very long.

679
00:41:08,043 --> 00:41:09,871
Hmm.

680
00:41:12,363 --> 00:41:14,840
You'll come around.

681
00:41:15,633 --> 00:41:18,131
They always do.

682
00:41:29,647 --> 00:41:31,483
Nope.

683
00:42:02,621 --> 00:42:04,569
Where did these plants come from?

684
00:42:04,668 --> 00:42:07,871
Get out. Before we call the police.

685
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:39,115
Oh, friends,

686
00:42:39,539 --> 00:42:41,840
you're all so beautiful.

687
00:42:43,195 --> 00:42:48,195
