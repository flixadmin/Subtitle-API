1
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,300
Rachel, let me see.

2
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,510
{\a1\pos(135,288)}- Can I see?
- Finders keepers. And I found it.

3
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,220
In my garden.

4
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,770
Finders keepers.

5
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:14,240
Bruce?

6
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,950
Bruce?

7
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:25,750
Mom! Mr. Alfred!

8
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:50,860
Did you have dream?

9
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:53,190
Nightmare.

10
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,030
Worse than this place?

11
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:23,010
They are going to fight you.

12
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,010
{\a1\pos(150,288)}- Again?
- Until they kill you.

13
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,020
Can they kill me before breakfast?

14
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,230
You are in hell, little man.

15
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:40,320
And I am the devil.

16
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,160
You're not the devil.

17
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:46,700
You're practice.

18
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,460
Solitary.

19
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,540
{\a1\pos(160,288)}- Why?
- For protection.

20
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,590
{\a1\pos(140,288)}- I don't need protection.
- Protection for them.

21
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,260
Get in.

22
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,260
Are you so desperate
to fight criminals...

23
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:51,100
...that you lock yourself in
to take them on one at a time?

24
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:56,270
Actually, there were seven of them.

25
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,730
I counted six, Mr. Wayne.

26
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:03,740
How do you know my name?

27
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,950
The world is too small for someone
like Bruce Wayne to disappear...

28
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,450
...no matter how deep
he chooses to sink.

29
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,790
Who are you?

30
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:14,120
My name is merely Ducard,
but I speak for Ra's al Ghul...

31
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:17,920
...a man greatly feared
by the criminal underworld.

32
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:19,670
A man who can offer you a path.

33
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:23,090
What makes you think I need a path?

34
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:26,090
Someone like you
is only here by choice.

35
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,640
You have been exploring
the criminal fraternity...

36
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,270
...but whatever
your original intentions...

37
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,310
...you have become truly lost.

38
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:40,650
And what path can Ra's al Ghul offer?

39
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:44,820
The path of a man
who shares his hatred of evil...

40
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:48,200
...and wishes to serve true justice.

41
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,790
The path of the League of Shadows.

42
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:56,170
{\a1\pos(155,288)}- You're vigilantes.
- No, no, no.

43
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:00,500
A vigilante is just a man lost in
the scramble for his own gratification.

44
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:04,340
He can be destroyed or locked up.

45
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:10,510
But if you make yourself more
than just a man...

46
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,680
...if you devote yourself to an ideal...

47
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:16,350
...and if they can't stop you...

48
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:19,190
...then you become
something else entirely.

49
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,400
Which is?

50
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,860
Legend, Mr. Wayne.

51
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,820
Tomorrow, you will be released.

52
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:32,370
If you are bored of brawling with petty thieves
and want to achieve something...

53
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:36,040
...there is a rare blue flower
that grows on the eastern slopes.

54
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,870
Pick one of these flowers.

55
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,000
If you can carry it
to the top of the mountain...

56
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:44,090
...you may find what you were
looking for in the first place.

57
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,010
And what was I looking for?

58
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,680
Only you can know that.

59
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:01,460
You turn back. You go back.

60
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:11,070
Ra's al Ghul?

61
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:22,870
Wait.

62
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,170
What are you seeking?

63
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,090
I seek...

64
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:33,880
...the means to fight injustice.

65
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,390
To turn fear...

66
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,560
...against those
who prey on the fearful.

67
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,330
To manipulate the fears in others...

68
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,590
...you must first master your own.

69
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:10,920
Are you ready to begin?

70
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,420
I can... I can barely stand.

71
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,930
Death does not wait
for you to be ready!

72
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:20,260
Death is not considerate or fair!

73
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:25,390
And make no mistake,
here you face death.

74
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,610
Tiger.

75
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:34,030
Jujitsu.

76
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,280
Panther.

77
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,120
You're skilled. But this is not a dance.

78
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,130
And you are afraid.

79
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:54,960
But not of me.

80
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,930
Tell us, Mr. Wayne...

81
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:08,600
...what do you fear?

82
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,160
Bruce?

83
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:24,330
It's okay. It's okay.

84
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,000
You'll be okay.

85
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,540
Will we be needing an ambulance,
Master Wayne?

86
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:31,710
No, I'll set the bone
and take him for an x-ray later.

87
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,130
Very good, sir.

88
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:37,300
{\a1\pos(135,288)}- I'm very sorry, sir. I've told...
- Don't worry. It's fine.

89
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,550
Took quite a fall, didn't we,
Master Bruce?

90
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,010
And why do we fall, Bruce?

91
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:46,430
So we can learn to pick ourselves up.

92
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:53,060
Just a little fall.
It's just a small fracture.

93
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,870
The bats again?

94
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,160
You know why they attacked you,
don't you?

95
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,710
{\a1\pos(140,288)}- They were afraid of you.
- Afraid of me?

96
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,880
All creatures feel fear.

97
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,380
Even the scary ones?

98
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,420
Especially the scary ones.

99
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,590
I got something to show you.

100
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:28,220
{\a1\pos(130,288)}- You think your mother will like them?
- Yeah.

101
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:31,060
{\a1\pos(140,288)}- I think it's time to get up.
- Maybe.

102
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,850
No going back to bed.

103
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,190
Did you build this train, Dad?

104
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:43,070
Gotham's been good to our family,
but the city's been suffering.

105
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,740
People less fortunate than us
have been enduring very hard times.

106
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:50,870
So we built a new, cheap, public
transportation system to unite the city.

107
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,750
And at the center...

108
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,750
...Wayne Tower.

109
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,800
{\a1\pos(140,288)}- Is that where you work?
- No, I work at the hospital.

110
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,170
I leave the running of our company
to much better men.

111
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,220
{\a1\pos(175,288)}- Better?
- Well...

112
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,640
...more interested men.

113
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,440
Can we go?

114
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,320
Please.

115
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,950
Okay. Let's go.

116
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:22,050
{\a1\pos(150,288)}- What's wrong, Bruce?
- No, no. It was me.

117
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:24,340
I just needed some fresh air.

118
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:27,680
A little bit of opera goes a long way.
Right, Bruce?

119
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,020
Come on. Let's go.

120
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,230
Wallets, jewelry. Come on, fast.

121
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,770
{\a1\pos(170,288)}- That's fine.
- Fast.

122
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,530
Take it easy.

123
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,740
Take it easy.

124
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:47,990
Here you go.

125
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:53,580
It's fine. It's fine.

126
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:57,580
Now just take it and go.

127
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,540
{\a1\pos(160,288)}- I said, jewelry.
- Hey...

128
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,920
Thomas!

129
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:12,560
Bruce.

130
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,560
It's okay.

131
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:21,440
Don't be afraid.

132
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,060
Is this your father's?

133
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,730
It's okay.

134
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,560
Come here.

135
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,480
There you go.

136
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:11,610
It's okay.

137
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,290
It's okay.

138
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:20,790
Gordon.

139
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,470
Hey.

140
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:32,300
Good news.

141
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,640
We got him, son.

142
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,160
You're in excellent hands.

143
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:00,000
We'll be watching the empire.

144
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,170
When you grow up,
it'll be waiting for you.

145
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:22,310
I thought I might prepare
a little supper.

146
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,570
{\a1\pos(170,288)}- Very well.
- Alfred?

147
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:35,530
{\a1\pos(140,288)}- Yes, Master Bruce?
- It was my fault, Alfred.

148
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,370
{\a1\pos(135,288)}- I made them leave the theater.
- No.

149
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:40,580
{\a1\pos(140,288)}- If I hadn't gotten scared...
- It was nothing that you did.

150
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:45,040
It was him, and him alone.

151
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,040
Do you understand?

152
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:53,220
I miss them, Alfred.
I miss them so much.

153
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,390
So do I, Master Bruce.

154
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,060
So do I.

155
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:04,140
And do you still feel responsible
for your parents' death?

156
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:06,440
My anger outweighs my guilt.

157
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:08,560
Come.

158
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,950
You have learned to bury
your guilt with anger.

159
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:19,160
I will teach you to confront it
and to face the truth.

160
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:26,620
You know how to fight six men.
We can teach you how to engage 600.

161
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,750
You know how to disappear.

162
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,130
We can teach you
to become truly invisible.

163
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,470
Invisible?

164
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:44,100
The ninja understands that invisibility
is a matter of patience and agility.

165
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,780
Always mind your surroundings.

166
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:04,160
Ninjitsu employs explosive powders.

167
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,920
{\a1\pos(160,288)}- As weapons?
- Or distractions.

168
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,420
Theatricality and deception
are powerful agents.

169
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,920
You must become more than just a man
in the mind of your opponent.

170
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,340
{\a1\pos(160,288)}- Who is he?
- He was a farmer.

171
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:21,760
Then he tried to take his neighbor's land
and became a murderer.

172
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:24,220
{\a1\pos(150,288)}- Now he is a prisoner.
- What'll happen to him?

173
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:26,810
Justice. Crime cannot be tolerated.

174
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:30,940
Criminals thrive on the indulgence
of society's understanding.

175
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,820
Your parents' death
was not your fault.

176
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,410
It was your father's.

177
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:11,150
Anger does not change the fact
that your father failed to act.

178
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:13,520
{\a1\pos(150,288)}- The man had a gun.
- Would that stop you?

179
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,530
I've had training.

180
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:17,530
The training is nothing!

181
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,360
Will is everything!

182
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,000
The will to act.

183
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,010
Yield.

184
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,720
You haven't beaten me.

185
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,590
You have sacrificed sure footing
for a killing stroke.

186
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,020
Rub your chest.

187
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,400
Your arms will
take care of themselves.

188
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,690
You are stronger than your father.

189
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,990
You didn't know my father.

190
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,450
But I know the rage that drives you.

191
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,910
That impossible anger
strangling the grief...

192
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,750
...until the memory
of your loved one is just...

193
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,920
...poison in your veins.

194
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,540
And one day, you catch yourself wishing
the person you loved had never existed...

195
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,420
...so you'd be spared your pain.

196
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,800
I wasn't always here in the mountains.

197
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:30,480
Once, I had a wife.

198
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,350
My great love.

199
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,650
She was taken from me.

200
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:40,030
Like you, I was forced to learn
there are those without decency...

201
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:43,490
...who must be fought
without hesitation, without pity.

202
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,620
Your anger gives you great power.

203
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,660
But if you let it, it will destroy you...

204
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:54,120
...as it almost did me.

205
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:57,000
{\a1\pos(160,288)}- What stopped it?
- Vengeance.

206
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:59,130
That's no help to me.

207
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,130
Why, Bruce?

208
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,970
Why could you not
avenge your parents?

209
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,270
Will you be heading back to Princeton
after the hearing, sir...

210
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:14,100
...or can I persuade you to stay on
for a day or two?

211
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:16,480
I'm not heading back at all.

212
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,690
{\a1\pos(140,288)}- You don't like it there?
- I like it fine.

213
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:21,900
They just don't feel the same way.

214
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:26,360
{\a1\pos(135,288)}- I've prepared the master bedroom.
- No.

215
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:27,950
My room will be fine.

216
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,660
With all due respect, sir,
Wayne Manor is your house.

217
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,660
No, Alfred, it's my father's house.

218
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:35,210
{\a1\pos(140,288)}- Your father is dead.
- This place is a mausoleum.

219
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:38,420
If I have my way, I'll pull
the damn thing down brick by brick.

220
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:42,670
This house, Master Wayne, has sheltered
six generations of your family.

221
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,550
Why do you give a damn, Alfred?
It's not your family.

222
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:50,260
I give a damn because a good man
once made me responsible...

223
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:53,100
...for what was
most precious to him...

224
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,520
...in the whole world.

225
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,020
Miss Dawes has offered
to drive you to the hearing.

226
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:03,230
She probably hopes
to talk you out of going.

227
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,860
Should I just bury the past out there
with my parents, Alfred?

228
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:10,120
I wouldn't presume to tell you
what to do with your past, sir.

229
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:14,330
Just know that there are those of us who
care about what you do with your future.

230
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,210
Haven't given up on me yet?

231
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,380
Never.

232
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:11,340
Alfred still keeps the condensed milk
on the top shelf.

233
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,140
Hasn't he noticed
you're tall enough to reach now?

234
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,600
Old habits die hard, I guess.

235
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:18,560
{\a1\pos(135,288)}- Never used to stop us anyway.
- No, it didn't.

236
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,600
How's your mom?

237
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:23,270
She misses this place.

238
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,280
So do I.

239
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:27,940
Yeah.

240
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:31,110
But it's nothing without the people
who made it what it was.

241
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,280
{\a1\pos(140,288)}- Now there's only Alfred.
- And you.

242
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:38,000
{\a1\pos(135,288)}- I'm not staying, Rachel.
- You're just back for the hearing.

243
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:45,800
Bruce, I don't suppose there's any way
to convince you not to come.

244
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:49,630
Someone at this proceeding...

245
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,470
...should stand for my parents.

246
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,760
We all loved your parents, Bruce.

247
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:58,140
{\a1\pos(130,288)}- What Chill did is unforgivable.
- Then why is your boss letting him go?

248
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,770
In prison, he shared a cell
with Carmine Falcone.

249
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:06,610
He learned things, and he will testify
in exchange for early parole.

250
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:09,440
Rachel, this man killed my parents.

251
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,160
I cannot let that pass.

252
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,200
And I need you
to understand that, please.

253
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:19,160
Okay.

254
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:23,580
The depression hit working people,
like Mr. Chill, hardest of all.

255
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:26,960
His crime was appalling, yes,
but it was motivated not by greed...

256
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,960
...but by desperation.

257
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:33,050
And given the 14 years served,
as well as his extraordinary level of cooperation...

258
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,850
...with one of this office's
most important investigations...

259
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:39,140
...we strongly endorse his petition
for early release.

260
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:42,440
Mr. Chill?

261
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,690
Your Honor...

262
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:51,690
...not a day goes by that I don't wish
I could take back what I did.

263
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,580
Sure, I was desperate,
like a lot of people back then...

264
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:00,080
...but that don't change what I did.

265
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:08,380
I gather there is a member
of the Wayne family here today.

266
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,840
Has he got anything to say?

267
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,400
{\a1\pos(135,288)}- He's coming out the side!
- He's coming out the side, guys!

268
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,370
Bruce Wayne!

269
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,410
Joe! Hey, Joe!

270
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,080
Falcone says hi.

271
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:59,010
Come on, Bruce.
We don't need to see this.

272
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,310
I do.

273
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,440
The DA couldn't understand
why Judge Faden...

274
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:10,440
...insisted on making the hearing public.

275
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:13,030
Falcone paid him off
to get Chill out in the open.

276
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:14,490
Maybe I should be thanking them.

277
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:17,240
{\a1\pos(135,288)}- You don't mean that.
- What if I do, Rachel?

278
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:19,320
My parents deserved justice.

279
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:22,410
You're not talking about justice.
You're talking about revenge.

280
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:25,460
{\a1\pos(130,288)}- Sometimes, they're the same.
- No, they're never the same, Bruce.

281
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:29,210
Justice is about harmony.
Revenge is about you making yourself feel better.

282
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:32,670
{\a1\pos(130,288)}- It's why we have an impartial system.
- Your system is broken.

283
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,600
You care about justice?
Look beyond your own pain, Bruce.

284
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:44,470
This city is rotting.

285
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,440
They talk about the depression
as if it's history and it's not.

286
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,100
Things are worse than ever here.

287
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:51,810
Falcone floods our streets
with crime and drugs...

288
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:54,940
...preying on the desperate,
creating new Joe Chills every day.

289
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:57,650
Falcone may not have killed
your parents, Bruce...

290
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,780
...but he's destroying everything
that they stood for.

291
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:08,210
You wanna thank him for that?
Here you go.

292
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,130
We all know where to find him.
As long as he keeps the bad people rich...

293
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:15,380
...and the good people scared,
no one'll touch him.

294
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:19,840
Good people like your parents,
who'll stand against injustice, they're gone.

295
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:23,720
What chance does Gotham have
when the good people do nothing?

296
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:28,020
{\a1\pos(120,288)}- I'm not one of your good people, Rachel.
- What do you mean?

297
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:33,310
All these years, I wanted to kill him.

298
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,690
Now I can't.

299
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,290
Your father would be ashamed of you.

300
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:39,260
You're taller than you look
in the tabloids, Mr. Wayne.

301
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:41,590
No gun? I'm insulted.

302
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:48,560
{\a1\pos(120,288)}- You could've just sent a thank-you note.
- I didn't come here to thank you.

303
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,480
I came to show you that
not everyone in Gotham's afraid of you.

304
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,270
Only those who know me, kid.

305
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,110
Look around you.
You'll see two councilmen...

306
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:59,280
...a union official,
couple off-duty cops...

307
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:01,320
...and a judge.

308
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:05,780
Now, I wouldn't have a second's hesitation of blowing
your head off right here and right now in front of them.

309
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:08,660
Now, that's power you can't buy.

310
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:10,750
That's the power of fear.

311
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,410
I'm not afraid of you.

312
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,500
Because you think you got
nothing to lose.

313
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,330
But you haven't thought it through.

314
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:19,590
You haven't thought about your
lady friend down in the DA's office.

315
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:22,170
You haven't thought about
your old butler. Bang!

316
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,640
People from your world...

317
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:31,180
...have so much to lose.

318
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:35,690
Now, you think because your mommy
and your daddy got shot...

319
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:38,820
...you know about the ugly side of life,
but you don't.

320
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:41,110
You've never tasted desperate.

321
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,820
You're... You're Bruce Wayne,
the prince of Gotham.

322
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:47,410
You'd have to go 1000 miles to meet
someone who didn't know your name.

323
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:51,870
So don't come here with your anger,
trying to prove something to yourself.

324
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,160
This is a world
you'll never understand.

325
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:56,330
And you always fear...

326
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,960
...what you don't understand.

327
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,210
All right.

328
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:13,680
Yeah, you got spirit, kid.
I'll give you that.

329
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:15,850
More than your old man anyway.

330
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:20,320
In the joint, Chill told me about
the night he killed your parents.

331
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,690
He said your father begged for mercy.

332
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,820
Begged.

333
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,360
Like a dog.

334
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:42,000
Should've tipped better.

335
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:53,850
{\a1\pos(170,288)}- For what?
- Your jacket.

336
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:56,020
Okay.

337
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:00,560
Hey, hey, hey. Let me have it.
It's a nice coat.

338
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:02,860
Be careful who sees you with that.

339
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,360
{\a1\pos(130,288)}- They're gonna come looking for me.
- Who?

340
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,530
Everyone.

341
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,570
It's...

342
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,740
It's a nice coat.

343
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:36,430
When you lived among the criminals,
did you start to pity them?

344
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:40,270
The first time I stole
so that I wouldn't starve, yes.

345
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:45,940
I lost many assumptions about
the simple nature of right and wrong.

346
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,320
And when I traveled...

347
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:52,200
...I learned the fear before a crime...

348
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:55,540
...and the thrill of success.

349
00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:59,290
But I never became one of them.

350
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:05,670
Fool. What the hell do I care what your name is?
You're a criminal.

351
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:08,920
Tell that to the guy who owned these.

352
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:16,100
You've traveled the world to understand
the criminal mind and conquer your fears.

353
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:22,310
But a criminal is not complicated.

354
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,820
And what you really fear
is inside yourself.

355
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:28,530
You fear your own power.

356
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:29,990
You fear your anger...

357
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:34,700
...the drive to do great
or terrible things.

358
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:38,330
Now you must journey inwards.

359
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,170
You are ready.

360
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:46,590
Breathe.

361
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,010
Breathe.

362
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,850
Breathe in your fears.

363
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,520
Face them.

364
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:12,820
To conquer fear,
you must become fear.

365
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:16,370
You must bask in the fear
of other men.

366
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:21,250
And men fear most
what they cannot see.

367
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:41,350
You have to become a terrible thought.

368
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,110
A wraith.

369
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:55,200
You have to become an idea!

370
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,120
Feel terror cloud your senses.

371
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:10,090
Feel its power to distort.

372
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:13,260
To control.

373
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:20,140
And know that this power
can be yours.

374
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:35,360
Embrace your worst fear.

375
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:44,660
Become one with the darkness.

376
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:06,180
Focus.

377
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,650
Concentrate.

378
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:10,940
Master your senses.

379
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:41,470
You cannot leave any sign.

380
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,050
I haven't.

381
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:53,360
Impressive.

382
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,530
We have purged your fear.

383
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,330
You are ready to lead these men.

384
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:11,040
You are ready to become a member
of the League of Shadows.

385
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:17,840
But first, you must demonstrate
your commitment to justice.

386
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,940
No.

387
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,690
I'm no executioner.

388
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:42,910
Your compassion is a weakness
your enemies will not share.

389
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,580
That's why it's so important.

390
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:47,580
It separates us from them.

391
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:50,120
You want to fight criminals.
This man is a murderer.

392
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:52,080
{\a1\pos(140,288)}- This man should be tried.
- By whom?

393
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:53,960
Corrupt bureaucrats?

394
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:56,630
Criminals mock society's laws.

395
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:59,090
You know this better than most.

396
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,590
You cannot lead these men...

397
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:06,760
...unless you are prepared to do
what is necessary to defeat evil.

398
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,770
And where would I be leading
these men?

399
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:11,600
Gotham.

400
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:13,810
As Gotham's favored son...

401
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:18,320
...you will be ideally placed
to strike at the heart of criminality.

402
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:22,450
{\a1\pos(145,288)}- How?
- Gotham's time has come.

403
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:25,950
Like Constantinople
or Rome before it...

404
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:30,330
...the city has become a breeding ground
for suffering and injustice.

405
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:34,120
It is beyond saving
and must be allowed to die.

406
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:39,460
This is the most important function
of the League of Shadows.

407
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:42,840
It is one we've performed
for centuries.

408
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:44,930
Gotham...

409
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:47,970
...must be destroyed.

410
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:52,810
You can't believe in this.

411
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:57,560
Ra's al Ghul rescued us from
the darkest corners of our own hearts.

412
00:37:57,730 --> 00:38:02,150
What he asks in return is the courage
to do what is necessary.

413
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:05,700
I will go back to Gotham
and I will fight men like this...

414
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:08,450
...but I will not
become an executioner.

415
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,160
Bruce, please.

416
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:13,160
For your own sake,
there is no turning back.

417
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:48,070
{\a1\pos(140,288)}- What are you doing?
- What's necessary, my friend.

418
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:07,630
I will tell him you saved his life.

419
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,900
Master Wayne,
you've been gone a long time.

420
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:31,360
{\a1\pos(140,288)}- Yes, I have.
- You look very fashionable.

421
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:34,360
Apart from the mud.

422
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:37,280
Are you coming back to Gotham
for long, sir?

423
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:38,700
As long as it takes.

424
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:40,370
I want to show the people of Gotham...

425
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:43,960
...their city doesn't belong
to the criminals and the corrupt.

426
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:47,340
In the depression, your father nearly
bankrupted Wayne Enterprises...

427
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,710
...combating poverty.

428
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:53,420
He believed his example could inspire
the wealthy of Gotham to save their city.

429
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,340
Did it?

430
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:57,930
In a way.

431
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:01,180
Their murder shocked the wealthy
and the powerful into action.

432
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:06,230
People need dramatic examples
to shake them out of apathy...

433
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,060
...and I can't do that as Bruce Wayne.

434
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:09,770
As a man...

435
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:12,360
...I'm flesh and blood,
I can be ignored, I can be destroyed.

436
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,450
But as a symbol...

437
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:18,580
As a symbol, I can be incorruptible.

438
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:21,370
{\a1\pos(150,288)}- I can be everlasting.
- What symbol?

439
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:24,620
Something elemental...

440
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:26,420
...something terrifying.

441
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:28,710
I assume as you're taking
on the underworld...

442
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:34,010
...this symbol is a persona to protect
those you care about from reprisals?

443
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:35,550
You're thinking about Rachel?

444
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,090
Actually, sir, I was thinking of myself.

445
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,850
Have you told anyone
I'm coming back?

446
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:46,270
I just couldn't figure the legal ramifications
of bringing you back from the dead.

447
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,310
{\a1\pos(135,288)}- Dead?
- You've been gone seven years.

448
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,770
You had me declared dead?

449
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:52,820
Actually, it was Mr. Earle.
He's taking the company public.

450
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:55,240
He wanted to liquidate
your majority shareholding.

451
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:57,780
Those shares are worth
quite a bit of money.

452
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:00,660
Well, it's a good thing
I left everything to you, then.

453
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,830
Quite so, sir.

454
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:06,750
And you can borrow the Rolls, if you like.
Just bring it back with a full tank.

455
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:21,510
In my opinion, Mr. Zsaz is as much
a danger to himself as to others...

456
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:26,480
...and prison is probably not the best
environment for his rehabilitation.

457
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:31,360
{\a1\pos(170,288)}- Dr. Crane.
- Miss Dawes.

458
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,820
You really think a man who butchers people
for the mob doesn't belong in jail?

459
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:37,650
I would hardly have testified to that otherwise,
would I, Miss Dawes?

460
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:40,910
This is the third of Carmine Falcone's thugs
you've had declared insane...

461
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:42,490
...and moved into your asylum.

462
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:47,330
The work offered by organized crime
must have an attraction to the insane.

463
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:50,880
Or the corrupt.

464
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:54,710
Mr. Finch.

465
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:56,840
I think you should check
with Miss Dawes here...

466
00:43:57,010 --> 00:44:01,390
...just what implications your office
has authorized her to make. If any.

467
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:07,680
{\a1\pos(140,288)}- What are you doing, Rachel?
- What are you doing, Carl?

468
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:09,230
Looking out for you.

469
00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:14,650
Falcone has half the city
bought and paid for.

470
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:16,860
{\a1\pos(150,288)}- Drop it.
- How can you say that?

471
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:20,740
Because as much as I care about getting Falcone,
I care more about you.

472
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:22,200
That's sweet.

473
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:30,000
We've been through all that.

474
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:57,530
Blessed bat again, sir.

475
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:00,400
They nest somewhere in the grounds.

476
00:46:58,270 --> 00:47:00,980
No more favors.
Someone is sniffing around.

477
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:04,110
Hey, I scratch your back,
you scratch mine, doc.

478
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,650
I'm bringing in the shipments.

479
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,570
We are paying you for that.

480
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:10,240
Maybe money isn't as interesting
to me as favors.

481
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:17,540
I am more than aware that you are
not intimidated by me, Mr. Falcone.

482
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:20,790
But you know who I'm working for,
and when he gets here...

483
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,880
He... He's coming to Gotham?

484
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:24,510
Yes, he is.

485
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:27,130
And when he gets here,
he's not going to wanna hear...

486
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:32,390
...that you've endangered our operation
just to get your thugs out of a little jail time.

487
00:47:33,390 --> 00:47:36,730
{\a1\pos(130,288)}- Who's bothering you?
- There's a girl at the DA's office.

488
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:39,020
{\a1\pos(155,288)}- We'll buy her off.
- Not this one.

489
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:42,070
Idealist, huh?

490
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:43,940
Well, there's an answer to that too.

491
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:47,280
{\a1\pos(150,288)}- I don't want to know.
- Yes, you do.

492
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:54,910
No, we are showing very healthy growth
in these sectors.

493
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:58,250
I don't think Thomas Wayne would have
viewed heavy-arms manufacture...

494
00:47:58,410 --> 00:48:00,580
...as a suitable cornerstone
for our business.

495
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:05,760
Well, that's 20 years ago, Fredericks.

496
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:09,260
I think after 20 years
we can allow ourselves...

497
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:12,260
...to stop thinking about what
Thomas Wayne would have done.

498
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:14,310
Good morning, Mr. Earle's office.

499
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:17,770
Oh, yes, he's confirmed for
the dinner tomorrow evening.

500
00:48:17,930 --> 00:48:21,270
Good morning.
I'm here to see Mr. Earle.

501
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,940
Name?

502
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,070
Bruce Wayne.

503
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:30,450
Thomas would probably not
have taken the company public.

504
00:48:30,610 --> 00:48:34,700
But that is what we,
as responsible managers, are going to do.

505
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:36,950
Jessica?

506
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,580
Jessica? Where are you?

507
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:45,000
{\a1\pos(130,288)}- Eye on the ball, and...
- Why is no one answering the phone?

508
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:48,840
It's Wayne Enterprises, Mr. Earle.
I'm sure they'll call back.

509
00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:51,680
Bruce? You're supposed to be dead.

510
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:53,800
I'm sorry to disappoint.

511
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:56,680
{\a1\pos(130,288)}- I need you to take a look at this.
- Have you seen him yet?

512
00:48:56,970 --> 00:48:58,520
{\a1\pos(175,288)}- Who?
- Wayne.

513
00:48:58,850 --> 00:49:00,940
It's been all over the news.
He's back.

514
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:07,780
I'm sure you realize
I can't stop the big machine.

515
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:09,190
Too many wheels turning.

516
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:11,360
{\a1\pos(150,288)}- We're going public.
- I understand.

517
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:14,660
And I'll be handsomely rewarded
for my shares.

518
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:17,370
I'm not looking to interfere.

519
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:19,950
{\a1\pos(145,288)}- I am looking for a job.
- Oh?

520
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:23,170
I just want to get to know the company
that my family built.

521
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:25,250
Any ideas where you would start?

522
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:28,130
Applied Sciences caught my eye.

523
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,210
Fox's department.

524
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:32,380
I'll let him know you're coming.

525
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:36,050
You look like him. Your dad.

526
00:49:36,850 --> 00:49:39,520
You're the only one left
of the Wayne family.

527
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:43,650
This is where you belong.
Welcome home.

528
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:48,480
Environmental procedures,
defense projects, consumer products.

529
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:51,690
All prototypes. None in production.

530
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:54,530
{\a1\pos(140,288)}- On any level whatsoever.
- None?

531
00:49:55,530 --> 00:49:57,370
What did they tell you this place was?

532
00:49:57,530 --> 00:49:59,580
They didn't tell me anything.

533
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:05,500
Earle told me exactly what it was
when he sent me down here.

534
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:07,420
Dead end.

535
00:50:07,590 --> 00:50:10,920
Place to keep me from causing
the board any more trouble.

536
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,380
Come on.

537
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:16,010
{\a1\pos(140,288)}- You were on the board?
- When your father ran things.

538
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:18,050
{\a1\pos(150,288)}- You knew my father?
- Oh, yeah.

539
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:19,890
Helped him build his train.

540
00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:22,100
Here we are.

541
00:50:25,770 --> 00:50:27,400
Kevlar utility harness.

542
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:29,730
Gas-powered, magnetic grapple gun.

543
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:32,240
The 350-pound test monofilament.

544
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:37,740
Wonderful project, your dad's train.

545
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:42,870
Routed it right into Wayne Tower,
along with the water and power utilities.

546
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:46,250
Kind of made Wayne Tower
the unofficial center of Gotham City.

547
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:49,090
Of course, Earle let it go to rot.
Here we are.

548
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,090
Nomex survival suit
for advanced infantry.

549
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:56,050
Kevlar biweave, reinforced joints.

550
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:58,760
{\a1\pos(135,288)}- Tear-resistant?
- This sucker will stop a knife.

551
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:01,140
{\a1\pos(135,288)}- Bulletproof?
- Anything but a straight shot.

552
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:04,180
{\a1\pos(120,288)}- Why didn't they put it into production?
- Bean counters didn't think...

553
00:51:04,350 --> 00:51:06,730
...a soldier's life was worth 300 grand.

554
00:51:07,810 --> 00:51:11,270
So, what's your interest in it,
Mr. Wayne?

555
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:13,440
I want to borrow it.

556
00:51:13,610 --> 00:51:15,400
For spelunking.

557
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:17,570
Spelunking?

558
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:19,450
Yeah, you know, cave diving?

559
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:23,410
You expecting to run into
much gunfire in these caves?

560
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:29,000
Look, I'd rather Mr. Earle
didn't know about me borrowing...

561
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:30,420
Mr. Wayne...

562
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:32,550
...the way I see it...

563
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,470
...all this stuff is yours anyway.

564
00:51:38,430 --> 00:51:40,930
Okay. Give it a try.

565
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,310
Charming.

566
00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:50,940
At least you'll have company.

567
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:56,820
This must be the lowest foundation
of the southeast wing.

568
00:52:09,290 --> 00:52:13,460
In the Civil War, your great-great-grandfather
was involved in the Underground Railroad...

569
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:16,630
...secretly transporting freed slaves
to the North...

570
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,510
...and I suspect these caverns
came in handy.

571
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:35,360
Alfred! Come up here!

572
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:38,530
I can see everything all right from down here, sir,
thank you very much.

573
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:01,220
We order the main part
of this cowl from Singapore.

574
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:02,890
Via a dummy corporation.

575
00:53:03,050 --> 00:53:04,890
Indeed. And then, quite separately...

576
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:10,020
...we place an order
to a Chinese company for these.

577
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:13,520
{\a1\pos(140,288)}- Put it together ourselves.
- Precisely.

578
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:17,730
They'll have to be large orders,
to avoid suspicion.

579
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:20,450
{\a1\pos(170,288)}- How large?
- Say 10,000.

580
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:25,870
{\a1\pos(135,288)}- Well, at least we'll have spares.
- Yes.

581
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:45,050
Don't suppose you want a taste.

582
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:48,390
I just keep offering,
thinking maybe someday you'll get wise.

583
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:50,730
There's nothing wise
in what you do, Flass.

584
00:53:50,890 --> 00:53:54,270
Well, Jimbo, you don't take the taste,
makes us guys nervous.

585
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,270
I'm no rat.

586
00:53:59,030 --> 00:54:02,740
In a town this bent,
who's there to rat to anyway?

587
00:54:32,430 --> 00:54:34,560
Don't turn around.

588
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:38,230
You're a good cop.
One of the few.

589
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,020
What do you want?

590
00:54:40,190 --> 00:54:43,360
Carmine Falcone brings in
shipments of drugs every week.

591
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:45,320
Nobody takes him down. Why?

592
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:48,870
He's paid up with the right people.

593
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:51,950
What will it take to bring him down?

594
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:55,080
Leverage on Judge Faden...

595
00:54:55,790 --> 00:54:58,170
...and a DA brave enough
to prosecute.

596
00:54:58,590 --> 00:55:00,210
Rachel Dawes.

597
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:01,920
Who are you?

598
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:03,970
Watch for my sign.

599
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:08,680
You're just one man?

600
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:10,510
Now we're two.

601
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,230
We?

602
00:55:29,870 --> 00:55:31,620
Freeze!

603
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,720
What the hell was that?

604
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:54,850
Just some nut.

605
00:55:58,270 --> 00:56:01,060
Well, what is it today?
More spelunking?

606
00:56:01,230 --> 00:56:03,730
No. Today it's BASE-jumping.

607
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:05,940
BASE-jumping.

608
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:09,070
{\a1\pos(150,288)}- That like parachuting?
- Kind of.

609
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:13,080
Do you have any lightweight fabrics?

610
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:15,910
You know,
I think I have just the thing.

611
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:19,710
It's called memory cloth.
Notice anything?

612
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:24,920
Regularly flexible...

613
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:27,470
...but put a current through it...

614
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:32,640
{\a1\pos(120,288)}- ...molecules realign, it becomes rigid.
- What kind of shapes can you make?

615
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:35,930
Can be tailored to fit any structure
based on a rigid skeleton.

616
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:37,310
Too expensive for the Army?

617
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:42,230
I don't think they ever tried to market it
to the billionaire, spelunking, BASE-jumping crowd.

618
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,190
{\a1\pos(160,288)}- Look, Mr. Fox.
- Yes, sir?

619
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:46,230
If you're uncomfortable...

620
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:49,610
Mr. Wayne, if you don't want to tell me
exactly what you're doing...

621
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:51,740
...when I'm asked, I don't have to lie.

622
00:56:53,490 --> 00:56:56,080
But don't think of me as an idiot.

623
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:59,540
Fair enough.

624
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:03,290
What's that?

625
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:07,300
The Tumbler?

626
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,760
Oh, you wouldn't be interested in that.

627
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:17,680
She was built as a bridging vehicle.

628
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:24,110
During combat, two of these
would jump over a river, towing cables.

629
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:30,280
Over here on the throttle,
flip that open and throttle up.

630
00:57:30,490 --> 00:57:33,030
This will boost you into a rampless jump...
Not now!

631
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:37,990
Not... Not now, sir.

632
00:57:40,830 --> 00:57:42,710
Afterburner disengaged.

633
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:46,130
We never could get
the damn bridge to work...

634
00:57:46,290 --> 00:57:48,000
...but this baby works just fine.

635
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:58,810
So, what do you think?

636
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:02,060
Does it come in black?

637
00:58:02,690 --> 00:58:05,060
I need you at the docks Thursday.

638
00:58:05,310 --> 00:58:07,190
{\a1\pos(140,288)}- Problems?
- I don't want any trouble...

639
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:09,480
{\a1\pos(140,288)}- ...with the last shipment.
- Sure.

640
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:14,740
Word on the street is you got a beef
with somebody in the DA's office.

641
00:58:14,910 --> 00:58:17,330
{\a1\pos(135,288)}- Is that right?
- And that there's a fat prize...

642
00:58:17,490 --> 00:58:20,200
...waiting for anybody willing
to do anything about it.

643
00:58:20,370 --> 00:58:22,330
So, what's your point, Mr. Flass?

644
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:24,040
Have you seen the girl?

645
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:27,210
It's a cute little assistant DA.

646
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:31,050
Don't you think that's a little too much
heat to bring down, maybe?

647
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:34,550
{\a1\pos(135,288)}- Even for this town.
- Never underestimate Gotham City.

648
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:37,550
People get mugged coming home
from work every day of the week.

649
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:40,350
Sometimes...
Sometimes things just go bad.

650
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:46,020
It's a problem with the graphite, sir.

651
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:48,900
The next 10,000
will be up to specifications.

652
00:58:49,070 --> 00:58:51,650
{\a1\pos(135,288)}- At least they gave us a discount.
- Quite.

653
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:57,450
In the meantime, sir, may I suggest
you try to avoid landing on your head?

654
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:36,490
Why bats, Master Wayne?

655
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:37,990
Bats frighten me.

656
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,580
It's time my enemies shared my dread.

657
01:00:08,270 --> 01:00:10,190
What is this?

658
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:15,320
Continue.

659
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:22,490
Looks fine out there.

660
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:24,830
The bears go straight to the dealers.

661
01:00:24,990 --> 01:00:27,660
Yeah, and the rabbits go
to the man in the Narrows.

662
01:00:27,830 --> 01:00:30,830
{\a1\pos(135,288)}- What's the difference?
- Ignorance is bliss, my friend.

663
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,170
Don't burden yourself
with the secrets of scary people.

664
01:00:50,020 --> 01:00:53,020
Hey. Steiss.

665
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:15,800
Steiss?

666
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:29,350
What?

667
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:31,560
What the...?

668
01:01:40,570 --> 01:01:42,410
I better check it.

669
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:56,960
There's a problem out here.
You better bail.

670
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:27,910
Where are you?!

671
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:29,120
Here.

672
01:02:50,180 --> 01:02:53,480
Get going. Oh, shit.

673
01:03:11,660 --> 01:03:13,790
What the hell are you?

674
01:03:16,830 --> 01:03:18,000
I'm Batman.

675
01:03:26,340 --> 01:03:28,300
Nice coat.

676
01:03:30,010 --> 01:03:31,560
Thanks.

677
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:13,850
Hold it.

678
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:18,440
That's right, you better run.

679
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:29,240
Falcone sent them to kill you.

680
01:04:30,370 --> 01:04:32,950
{\a1\pos(150,288)}- Why?
- You rattled his cage.

681
01:04:36,750 --> 01:04:38,290
{\a1\pos(170,288)}- What's this?
- Leverage.

682
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:40,080
{\a1\pos(150,288)}- For what?
- To get things moving.

683
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:42,380
Who are you?

684
01:04:42,750 --> 01:04:44,000
Someone like you.

685
01:04:44,170 --> 01:04:46,210
Someone who'll rattle the cages.

686
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:54,810
Ma'am? Everything okay?

687
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:01,600
{\a1\pos(160,288)}- Falcone's men?
- Does it matter?

688
01:05:01,770 --> 01:05:04,070
We'll never tie him to it anyway.

689
01:05:04,270 --> 01:05:06,400
I wouldn't be too sure of that.

690
01:05:19,460 --> 01:05:21,290
What the hell is that?

691
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:32,140
Cut him down.

692
01:05:54,740 --> 01:05:55,990
Unacceptable.

693
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:59,000
Now, I don't care if it's rival gangs,
Guardian Angels...

694
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:01,120
...or the goddamn Salvation Army...

695
01:06:01,370 --> 01:06:03,710
...get them off the street
and off the front page.

696
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:06,460
They say it was just one guy.
Or a creature.

697
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:09,340
It was some asshole in a costume.

698
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:11,510
{\a1\pos(140,288)}- Yeah?
- This guy did deliver us...

699
01:06:11,670 --> 01:06:14,470
...one of the city's biggest crime lords.

700
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:18,140
No one takes the law
into their own hands in my city.

701
01:06:18,310 --> 01:06:19,520
Understand?

702
01:06:19,810 --> 01:06:22,270
{\a1\pos(120,288)}- No way to bury it now.
- Maybe so, but there's still Judge Faden.

703
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:25,520
{\a1\pos(110,288)}- I've got Faden covered.
- Okay, what about this bat they're babbling about?

704
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:28,820
Even if these guys will swear in court
to being thrashed by a giant bat...

705
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:31,150
...we've got Falcone at the scene.

706
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:34,530
Drugs, prints, cargo manifests.
This bat character gave us everything.

707
01:06:34,950 --> 01:06:36,490
Okay. Let's do it.

708
01:06:39,910 --> 01:06:42,040
{\a1\pos(150,288)}- Bats are nocturnal.
- Bats may be.

709
01:06:42,210 --> 01:06:45,630
But even for billionaire playboys,
3:00 is pushing it.

710
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:49,550
The price for leading a double life,
I fear.

711
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:53,300
Your theatrics made an impression.

712
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:57,720
Theatricality and deception...

713
01:06:57,890 --> 01:07:01,100
...are powerful weapons, Alfred.
This is a good start.

714
01:07:01,270 --> 01:07:04,060
If those are to be the first
of many injuries to come...

715
01:07:04,230 --> 01:07:07,060
...it would be wise
to find a suitable excuse.

716
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:08,730
Polo, for instance.

717
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:10,570
I'm not learning polo, Alfred.

718
01:07:10,820 --> 01:07:14,490
Strange injuries,
a nonexistent social life.

719
01:07:14,650 --> 01:07:16,110
These things beg the question...

720
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:20,540
...as to what exactly does Bruce Wayne
do with his time and his money.

721
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:22,290
What does someone like me do?

722
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:27,460
Drive sports cars, date movie stars.

723
01:07:28,130 --> 01:07:29,710
Buy things that are not for sale.

724
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:33,420
Who knows, Master Wayne,
you start pretending to have fun...

725
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:36,050
...you might even have a little
by accident.

726
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:40,220
Sir.

727
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:42,720
{\a1\pos(150,288)}- We have a situation.
- All right.

728
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:46,940
The Coast Guard picked up
one of our cargo ships last night...

729
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:52,280
...heavily damaged, all crew missing,
probably dead.

730
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:56,700
The ship was carrying
a prototype weapon.

731
01:07:56,910 --> 01:07:58,700
It's a microwave emitter.

732
01:07:58,870 --> 01:08:01,830
It's designed for desert warfare,
but it...

733
01:08:03,490 --> 01:08:05,080
It looks like somebody...

734
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:10,960
...turned it on.

735
01:08:15,130 --> 01:08:19,590
It uses focused microwaves to
vaporize the enemy's water supply.

736
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:30,480
The damage to the ship
was catastrophic.

737
01:08:30,650 --> 01:08:33,650
The weapon itself is...

738
01:08:34,940 --> 01:08:36,440
Missing?

739
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:38,530
Yeah.

740
01:08:39,820 --> 01:08:41,780
Mr. Wayne.

741
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:46,960
Nice car.

742
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:48,500
You should see my other one.

743
01:08:58,510 --> 01:09:00,470
He's done something
the police have never done.

744
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:02,930
You can't take the law
into your own hands.

745
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:05,680
Well, at least he's getting
something done.

746
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:08,180
Bruce, help me out here.

747
01:09:08,350 --> 01:09:12,690
Well, a guy who dresses up
like a bat clearly has issues.

748
01:09:13,730 --> 01:09:15,980
But he's put Falcone behind bars.

749
01:09:16,150 --> 01:09:18,530
And now the cops wanna bring him in.
So what does that tell you?

750
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:19,900
They're jealous.

751
01:09:20,070 --> 01:09:22,700
Sir, the pool is for decoration...

752
01:09:22,870 --> 01:09:26,240
...and your friends
do not have swimwear.

753
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:30,040
Well, they're European.

754
01:09:31,870 --> 01:09:34,250
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

755
01:09:35,170 --> 01:09:38,630
{\a1\pos(135,288)}- It is not a question of money.
- Well, you see...

756
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:41,010
...I'm buying this hotel...

757
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:47,220
...and setting some new rules
about the pool area.

758
01:09:48,390 --> 01:09:50,770
I think the Batman deserves a medal.

759
01:09:50,940 --> 01:09:53,060
And a straitjacket to pin it on.

760
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:01,150
Thank you.

761
01:10:02,910 --> 01:10:04,240
Bruce?

762
01:10:07,830 --> 01:10:09,620
Rachel?

763
01:10:09,790 --> 01:10:11,210
I'd heard you were back.

764
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:14,750
What are you doing?

765
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:19,920
Just swimming here.
Wow, it is good to see you.

766
01:10:20,090 --> 01:10:21,630
You were gone a long time.

767
01:10:22,220 --> 01:10:25,140
{\a1\pos(145,288)}- I know. How are things?
- The same.

768
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:28,720
Job's getting worse.

769
01:10:28,890 --> 01:10:31,600
Can't change the world on your own.

770
01:10:31,770 --> 01:10:33,850
What choice do I have...

771
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:36,270
...when you're too busy swimming?

772
01:10:37,610 --> 01:10:39,650
Rachel, all of...

773
01:10:39,940 --> 01:10:41,610
All this...

774
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:47,080
It's... It's not me. It's...

775
01:10:47,490 --> 01:10:50,120
Inside, I am...

776
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:53,290
I am more.

777
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:55,500
Come on, Bruce. Come on.

778
01:10:55,670 --> 01:10:59,460
Bruce, we have some more hotels
for you to buy.

779
01:11:00,510 --> 01:11:01,970
Bruce...

780
01:11:03,130 --> 01:11:06,640
...deep down you may still be
that same great kid you used to be.

781
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:11,640
But it's not who you are underneath...

782
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:13,850
...it's what you do that defines you.

783
01:11:26,410 --> 01:11:27,990
Dr. Crane, thanks for coming.

784
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:31,040
Not at all. He cut his wrists?

785
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:34,870
Probably looking for the insanity plea.
But if anything should happen...

786
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:38,000
Of course, better safe than sorry.

787
01:11:41,420 --> 01:11:45,010
Yeah, Dr. Crane, I can't take it anymore.
It's all too much.

788
01:11:45,170 --> 01:11:47,640
The walls are closing in.
Blah, blah, blah.

789
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:50,680
A couple of days of this food,
it'll be true.

790
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:53,350
{\a1\pos(160,288)}- What do you want?
- I wanna know...

791
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:56,020
...how you're gonna convince me
to keep my mouth shut.

792
01:11:56,190 --> 01:11:58,350
About what?
You don't know anything.

793
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:02,690
I know you don't want the cops to take
a closer look at the drugs they seized.

794
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:07,030
And I know about your experiments
with the inmates of your nut house.

795
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:10,870
See, I don't go into business with a guy
without finding out his dirty secrets.

796
01:12:11,450 --> 01:12:14,370
And those goons you used.

797
01:12:14,540 --> 01:12:16,370
I own the muscle in this town.

798
01:12:16,540 --> 01:12:19,920
Now, I've been bringing
your stuff in for months...

799
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:24,670
...so whatever he's planning,
it's big, and I want in.

800
01:12:25,970 --> 01:12:29,090
Well, I already know what he'll say.

801
01:12:29,510 --> 01:12:30,890
That we should kill you.

802
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:36,060
Even he can't get me in here.
Not in my town.

803
01:12:42,020 --> 01:12:43,570
Would you like to see my mask?

804
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:46,570
I use it in my experiments.

805
01:12:49,070 --> 01:12:53,530
Now, I'm probably not very frightening
to a guy like you.

806
01:12:53,910 --> 01:12:56,750
But these crazies, they can't stand it.

807
01:12:57,660 --> 01:12:59,620
So when did the nut
take over the nut house?

808
01:13:00,580 --> 01:13:03,250
They scream and they cry...

809
01:13:04,250 --> 01:13:05,880
...much as you're doing now.

810
01:13:08,220 --> 01:13:11,430
Well, he's not faking. Not that one.

811
01:13:11,590 --> 01:13:14,140
I'll talk to the judge
and see if I can get him moved...

812
01:13:14,310 --> 01:13:17,730
...to the secure wing at Arkham.
I can't treat him here.

813
01:13:39,750 --> 01:13:41,250
Storm's coming.

814
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:48,840
The scum is getting jumpy
because you stood up to Falcone.

815
01:13:49,010 --> 01:13:52,550
It's a start.
Your partner was at the docks with Falcone.

816
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:55,430
Well, he moonlights
as a low-level enforcer.

817
01:13:55,810 --> 01:13:59,600
They were splitting the shipment in two.
Only half went to the dealers.

818
01:13:59,770 --> 01:14:01,690
Why? What about the other half?

819
01:14:02,150 --> 01:14:04,560
{\a1\pos(160,288)}- Flass knows.
- He won't talk.

820
01:14:05,190 --> 01:14:06,770
He'll talk to me.

821
01:14:06,940 --> 01:14:09,990
Commissioner Loeb set up
a massive task force to catch you.

822
01:14:10,450 --> 01:14:12,990
{\a1\pos(140,288)}- He thinks you're dangerous.
- What do you think?

823
01:14:14,740 --> 01:14:17,160
I think you're trying to help.

824
01:14:22,170 --> 01:14:24,500
But I've been wrong before.

825
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:32,010
Come on, I ain't got all night.

826
01:14:35,350 --> 01:14:37,180
Flass, I have kids to feed.

827
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:39,810
What, they don't like falafel?

828
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:56,910
Where were the other drugs going?

829
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:00,370
I never knew. I don't know.

830
01:15:00,540 --> 01:15:02,750
{\a1\pos(160,288)}- I swear to God.
- Swear to me!

831
01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:11,380
I don't... I don't know.
I never knew. Never.

832
01:15:11,670 --> 01:15:15,130
They went to some guy for a couple days
before they went to the dealers.

833
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:16,590
Why?

834
01:15:17,260 --> 01:15:20,850
There was something...
Something else in the drugs...

835
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:22,600
{\a1\pos(150,288)}- ...something hidden.
- What?

836
01:15:22,770 --> 01:15:26,100
I never went to the drop-off point.
It was in the Narrows.

837
01:15:26,270 --> 01:15:29,570
{\a1\pos(120,288)}- Cops only go there when they're in force.
- Do I look like a cop?

838
01:15:29,730 --> 01:15:31,530
No...

839
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:47,170
This is the one I'm talking about.

840
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:49,750
{\a1\pos(140,288)}- What's your problem with it?
- It shouldn't exist.

841
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:53,760
This ship left Singapore with 246 containers,
but arrived with 247.

842
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:56,300
So I'm guessing there's something
I'm not supposed to find in there.

843
01:15:56,470 --> 01:15:59,890
Listen, counselor, we don't wanna
know what's in Mr. Falcone's crate.

844
01:16:00,050 --> 01:16:03,390
Things are working a little
differently now. Open it up.

845
01:16:12,980 --> 01:16:14,240
What the hell is this?

846
01:16:56,820 --> 01:16:59,990
It's you, isn't it?
Everybody's been talking about you.

847
01:17:00,570 --> 01:17:02,330
Get in here!

848
01:17:02,950 --> 01:17:05,080
The other kids won't believe me.

849
01:17:28,180 --> 01:17:30,310
Get rid of all traces.

850
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:33,520
{\a1\pos(135,288)}- Better torch the whole place.
- All right.

851
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:11,350
Having trouble?

852
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:14,400
Take a seat. Have a drink.

853
01:18:15,110 --> 01:18:18,360
You look like a man
who takes himself too seriously.

854
01:18:22,070 --> 01:18:25,070
Do you want my opinion?
You need to lighten up.

855
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:20,760
Alfred, help me.

856
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:34,020
Blood. Take. Take poison.
Blood poison.

857
01:19:34,190 --> 01:19:37,190
Poisonous. Poisonous.

858
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:43,190
Bruce...

859
01:19:44,490 --> 01:19:45,660
...why do we fall?

860
01:19:57,750 --> 01:20:01,050
{\a1\pos(150,288)}- How long was I out?
- Two days.

861
01:20:01,460 --> 01:20:03,300
It's your birthday.

862
01:20:04,630 --> 01:20:05,880
Many happy returns.

863
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:14,890
I've felt these effects before,
but this was so much more potent.

864
01:20:15,100 --> 01:20:19,650
It was some kind of hallucinogen,
weaponized, in aerosol form.

865
01:20:19,860 --> 01:20:22,780
You have been hanging out
in the wrong clubs, Mr. Wayne.

866
01:20:22,980 --> 01:20:26,030
I called Mr. Fox when your condition
worsened after the first day.

867
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:27,570
I analyzed your blood...

868
01:20:27,780 --> 01:20:31,240
...isolating the receptor compounds
and the protein-based catalyst.

869
01:20:31,450 --> 01:20:33,200
Am I meant to understand any of that?

870
01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:36,750
Not at all.
I just wanted you to know how hard it was.

871
01:20:37,370 --> 01:20:41,040
{\a1\pos(120,288)}- Bottom line, I synthesized an antidote.
- Could you make more?

872
01:20:41,250 --> 01:20:43,800
You planning on gassing yourself
again, Mr. Wayne?

873
01:20:44,010 --> 01:20:47,180
Well, you know how it is, Mr. Fox.
You're out at night, looking for kicks...

874
01:20:47,380 --> 01:20:50,140
...someone's passing around
the weaponized hallucinogens...

875
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:53,720
I'll bring what I have.
The antidote should inoculate you for now.

876
01:20:53,930 --> 01:20:56,270
Alfred, always a pleasure.

877
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:58,100
Lucius.

878
01:21:02,650 --> 01:21:05,320
{\a1\pos(130,288)}- You sure you don't want to come in?
- I have to get back.

879
01:21:05,490 --> 01:21:07,150
{\a1\pos(145,288)}- I wanted to leave this.
- Thank you.

880
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:08,700
Rachel?

881
01:21:10,110 --> 01:21:13,280
Looks like someone's been
burning the candle at both ends.

882
01:21:13,490 --> 01:21:16,160
{\a1\pos(135,288)}- Must've been quite an occasion.
- It is my birthday.

883
01:21:16,370 --> 01:21:20,000
I know. I'm sorry I can't come tonight.
I was just dropping off your present.

884
01:21:20,210 --> 01:21:23,630
{\a1\pos(120,288)}- You've got better plans?
- My boss has been missing for two days...

885
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:27,510
...which in this town means that I should
probably start by looking at the bottom of the river.

886
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:29,180
{\a1\pos(170,288)}- Rachel.
- Excuse me.

887
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:33,300
Rachel Dawes.

888
01:21:33,930 --> 01:21:37,520
Who authorized that? Get Crane down there right now.
Do not take no for an answer.

889
01:21:37,730 --> 01:21:41,560
Call Dr. Lehmann, tell him we need our
own assessment on the judge's desk by morning.

890
01:21:42,020 --> 01:21:43,820
{\a1\pos(165,288)}- What's wrong?
- It's Falcone.

891
01:21:44,020 --> 01:21:46,480
Dr. Crane moved him to Arkham Asylum
on suicide watch.

892
01:21:46,690 --> 01:21:49,650
You're going to Arkham now?
It's in the Narrows, Rachel.

893
01:21:50,950 --> 01:21:52,740
You enjoy your party, Bruce.

894
01:21:52,950 --> 01:21:55,660
{\a1\pos(140,288)}- Some of us have work to do.
- You be careful.

895
01:21:57,450 --> 01:21:59,000
Happy birthday.

896
01:22:18,430 --> 01:22:20,520
But, Master Wayne,
the guests will be arriving.

897
01:22:20,730 --> 01:22:22,310
Keep them happy until I arrive.

898
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:24,690
Tell them that joke you know.

899
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:05,230
Having fun?

900
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:10,940
Bill? Now, what's a big shot like you
doing in a place like this?

901
01:23:11,150 --> 01:23:12,400
I need some information.

902
01:23:12,610 --> 01:23:17,370
The Wayne Enterprise 47-B, 1-ME.

903
01:23:18,700 --> 01:23:20,160
1-ME.

904
01:23:20,370 --> 01:23:24,080
It's a microwave emitter.
It was designed to vaporize an enemy's water supply.

905
01:23:24,290 --> 01:23:28,500
Rumor was they tested dispersing
water-based chemicals into the air...

906
01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:30,590
...but isn't that illegal?

907
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:36,550
I want all the information
on the development of this project...

908
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:40,720
...all data, files, backup disks,
on my desk right away.

909
01:23:41,140 --> 01:23:42,770
Did you lose one?

910
01:23:43,850 --> 01:23:47,440
I'm merging your department
with Archives.

911
01:23:48,690 --> 01:23:49,940
And I am firing you.

912
01:23:52,110 --> 01:23:54,070
Didn't you get the memo?

913
01:24:01,330 --> 01:24:02,950
Scarecrow.

914
01:24:06,290 --> 01:24:08,130
Scarecrow.

915
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:12,800
Scarecrow.

916
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:18,010
Miss Dawes, this is most irregular.

917
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:21,100
I have nothing further to add
to the report I filed with the judge.

918
01:24:21,310 --> 01:24:23,520
{\a1\pos(130,288)}- I have questions about your report.
- Such as?

919
01:24:23,730 --> 01:24:27,980
Isn't it convenient for a 52-year-old man
who has no history of mental illness...

920
01:24:28,190 --> 01:24:31,770
...to suddenly have a complete psychotic breakdown
just when he's about to be indicted?

921
01:24:31,980 --> 01:24:36,200
As you can see for yourself,
there is nothing convenient about his symptoms.

922
01:24:40,870 --> 01:24:42,240
{\a1\pos(150,288)}- Scarecrow.
- What's "scarecrow"?

923
01:24:42,740 --> 01:24:46,330
Patients suffering delusional episodes
often focus their paranoia...

924
01:24:46,540 --> 01:24:48,630
...on an external tormentor...

925
01:24:48,830 --> 01:24:52,000
...usually one conforming
to Jungian archetypes.

926
01:24:52,250 --> 01:24:54,630
In this case, a scarecrow.

927
01:24:56,130 --> 01:25:00,260
{\a1\pos(120,288)}- He's drugged?
- Psychopharmacology is my primary field.

928
01:25:00,430 --> 01:25:01,800
I'm a strong advocate.

929
01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:04,890
Outside, he was a giant.

930
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:07,520
In here, only the mind
can grant you power.

931
01:25:07,730 --> 01:25:09,440
You enjoy the reversal.

932
01:25:09,650 --> 01:25:12,610
I respect the mind's power
over the body.

933
01:25:12,820 --> 01:25:14,360
It's why I do what I do.

934
01:25:14,530 --> 01:25:19,410
I do what I do to keep thugs like Falcone
behind bars, not in therapy.

935
01:25:19,610 --> 01:25:22,870
I want my own psychiatric consultant
to have full access to Falcone...

936
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:26,370
...including blood work.
Find out what exactly you put him on.

937
01:25:26,580 --> 01:25:29,040
{\a1\pos(140,288)}- First thing tomorrow, then.
- Tonight.

938
01:25:29,250 --> 01:25:32,670
I've already paged Dr. Lehmann
at County General.

939
01:25:34,090 --> 01:25:35,880
As you wish.

940
01:25:41,430 --> 01:25:43,350
This way, please.

941
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:46,140
There's something
I think you should see.

942
01:25:57,070 --> 01:25:59,650
This is where we make the medicine.

943
01:26:06,490 --> 01:26:10,370
Perhaps you should have some,
clear your head.

944
01:26:35,650 --> 01:26:37,230
Who knows you're here?

945
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:39,900
Who knows?

946
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:48,370
He's here.

947
01:26:48,580 --> 01:26:49,790
Who?

948
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,920
The Batman.

949
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:55,630
{\a1\pos(150,288)}- What do we do?
- What anyone does...

950
01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:58,590
...when a prowler comes around.

951
01:26:59,550 --> 01:27:02,090
{\a1\pos(145,288)}- Call the police.
- You want the cops here?

952
01:27:02,680 --> 01:27:05,430
At this point, they can't stop us.

953
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:09,140
But the Batman
has a talent for disruption.

954
01:27:09,350 --> 01:27:12,520
Force him outside,
the police will take him down. Go.

955
01:27:12,730 --> 01:27:14,810
{\a1\pos(150,288)}- What about her?
- She hasn't got long.

956
01:27:15,020 --> 01:27:16,940
I gave her a concentrated dose.

957
01:27:17,150 --> 01:27:19,690
The mind can only take so much.
Now go.

958
01:27:22,240 --> 01:27:24,490
The things they say about him.

959
01:27:24,700 --> 01:27:26,240
Can he really fly?

960
01:27:26,410 --> 01:27:28,450
I heard he can disappear.

961
01:27:28,660 --> 01:27:31,660
Well, we'll find out.

962
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:33,580
Won't we?

963
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:23,050
Taste of your own medicine, doctor?

964
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:31,560
What have you been doing here?

965
01:28:34,680 --> 01:28:37,060
Who are you working for?

966
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:43,860
Ra's... Ra's al Ghul.

967
01:28:44,070 --> 01:28:48,910
Ra's al Ghul is dead.
Who are you working for?

968
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:50,120
Crane.

969
01:28:52,620 --> 01:28:55,540
Dr. Crane isn't here right now.

970
01:28:56,120 --> 01:28:58,000
But if you'd like to make
an appointment...

971
01:29:11,050 --> 01:29:13,930
Batman, put down your weapons
and surrender.

972
01:29:14,680 --> 01:29:16,060
You're surrounded.

973
01:29:21,650 --> 01:29:24,400
{\a1\pos(140,288)}- What are you waiting for?
- Backup.

974
01:29:25,150 --> 01:29:27,530
{\a1\pos(150,288)}- Backup?
- The Batman's in there.

975
01:29:27,740 --> 01:29:29,860
SWAT's on the way.
But if you wanna go in now...

976
01:29:30,070 --> 01:29:31,620
...I'll be right behind you, sir.

977
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:34,620
SWAT's on the way.

978
01:29:35,750 --> 01:29:37,000
- Hey.
- Hey.

979
01:30:19,540 --> 01:30:21,210
What's happened to her?

980
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:27,670
Crane poisoned her with a psychotropic hallucinogen,
a panic-inducing toxin.

981
01:30:29,720 --> 01:30:33,430
{\a1\pos(130,288)}- Let me get her down to the medics.
- They can't help her, but I can.

982
01:30:37,390 --> 01:30:39,520
Get her downstairs.
Meet me in the alley on the Narrows' side.

983
01:30:47,530 --> 01:30:50,360
Crane's been smuggling his toxin
hidden in Falcone's drugs...

984
01:30:50,570 --> 01:30:52,700
...and they're dumping it
into the water supply.

985
01:30:53,240 --> 01:30:54,870
{\a1\pos(150,288)}- What was he planning?
- I don't know.

986
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:56,410
Was he working for Falcone?

987
01:30:56,910 --> 01:30:59,410
He mentioned someone else,
someone worse.

988
01:30:59,620 --> 01:31:02,170
I need to get her the antidote
before the damage becomes permanent.

989
01:31:02,370 --> 01:31:04,540
{\a1\pos(145,288)}- How long does she have?
- Not long.

990
01:31:08,460 --> 01:31:10,220
What is that?

991
01:31:11,630 --> 01:31:13,890
{\a1\pos(170,288)}- Backup.
- What the...?

992
01:32:32,130 --> 01:32:33,630
Excuse me.

993
01:32:38,430 --> 01:32:41,640
{\a1\pos(140,288)}- How is she?
- She's fading. We gotta go.

994
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:44,980
I'll get my car.

995
01:32:45,140 --> 01:32:46,940
I brought mine.

996
01:32:47,350 --> 01:32:48,980
Yours?

997
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:00,120
I've gotta get me one of those.

998
01:33:01,370 --> 01:33:03,490
{\a1\pos(150,288)}- He is in a vehicle.
- Make and color?

999
01:33:03,700 --> 01:33:06,040
It's a black...

1000
01:33:07,370 --> 01:33:08,670
...tank.

1001
01:33:11,340 --> 01:33:12,670
Stay calm.

1002
01:33:13,380 --> 01:33:15,130
You've been poisoned.

1003
01:33:17,880 --> 01:33:19,180
I'm on him.

1004
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:28,650
Breathe slowly.

1005
01:33:38,780 --> 01:33:39,860
Hold on.

1006
01:33:54,380 --> 01:33:55,710
{\a1\pos(150,288)}- What are you doing?
- Shortcut.

1007
01:34:04,260 --> 01:34:06,020
Air One to ground, block that ramp.

1008
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:12,190
He's got no way off that roof.

1009
01:34:13,610 --> 01:34:16,690
Turn off your engine.
Step away from the car.

1010
01:34:19,070 --> 01:34:21,820
{\a1\pos(140,288)}- Trust me.
- Weapons system activated.

1011
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:41,010
Who is this guy?

1012
01:34:41,340 --> 01:34:43,050
{\a1\pos(160,288)}- Where's he going?
- He's on the roof.

1013
01:34:57,480 --> 01:34:59,650
{\a1\pos(140,288)}- What street is he taking?
- He's not on a street.

1014
01:34:59,860 --> 01:35:01,570
He's flying on rooftops.

1015
01:35:40,820 --> 01:35:43,030
At least tell me what it looks like.

1016
01:35:46,070 --> 01:35:47,490
Never mind.

1017
01:35:51,410 --> 01:35:52,750
Got him.

1018
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:05,220
Coming right up on his butt.

1019
01:36:29,950 --> 01:36:32,370
We're tracking suspect vehicle
heading west on I-17.

1020
01:36:37,670 --> 01:36:39,340
{\a1\pos(155,288)}- Air One to ground.
- I lost him.

1021
01:36:39,540 --> 01:36:41,380
We've lost visual. Exit 9 is blocked.

1022
01:36:41,590 --> 01:36:43,550
We'll loop back to check
the frontage road.

1023
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:45,840
Stealth mode activated.

1024
01:36:46,510 --> 01:36:47,720
Stay with me.

1025
01:36:53,930 --> 01:36:55,390
What...? There he is.

1026
01:37:15,120 --> 01:37:16,580
Just hold on.

1027
01:37:20,540 --> 01:37:21,710
Rachel!

1028
01:37:54,490 --> 01:37:56,830
{\a1\pos(120,288)}- They get any of this crap into the mains?
- Oh yeah.

1029
01:37:57,040 --> 01:37:59,870
Notify the water company.
There's gotta be a way of isolating the area.

1030
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:02,920
No. You don't understand.
They put it all in. They must've been at this for weeks.

1031
01:38:03,130 --> 01:38:06,670
{\a1\pos(115,288)}- Gotham's entire water supply is laced with it.
- Why haven't we felt the effects?

1032
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:09,130
Must be a compound that has
to be absorbed through the lungs.

1033
01:38:19,390 --> 01:38:21,060
How do you feel?

1034
01:38:23,860 --> 01:38:25,320
Where are we?

1035
01:38:25,860 --> 01:38:29,610
{\a1\pos(120,288)}- Why did you bring me here?
- If I hadn't, your mind would now be lost.

1036
01:38:29,820 --> 01:38:31,820
{\a1\pos(155,288)}- You were poisoned.
- It was...

1037
01:38:32,030 --> 01:38:35,620
{\a1\pos(145,288)}- It was Dr. Crane.
- Rest. Gordon has Crane.

1038
01:38:35,830 --> 01:38:37,910
Is Sergeant Gordon your friend?

1039
01:38:38,790 --> 01:38:40,420
I don't have the luxury of friends.

1040
01:38:41,330 --> 01:38:44,630
I'm gonna give you a sedative.
You'll wake up back at home.

1041
01:38:44,840 --> 01:38:48,760
When you do, get these to Gordon,
and Gordon alone. Trust no one.

1042
01:38:48,970 --> 01:38:50,680
{\a1\pos(160,288)}- What are they?
- The antidote.

1043
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:54,180
One for Gordon to inoculate himself,
the other for mass production.

1044
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:55,850
Mass production?

1045
01:38:56,060 --> 01:38:59,180
Crane was just a pawn.
We need to be ready.

1046
01:39:25,170 --> 01:39:28,550
When you told me your grand plan
for saving Gotham...

1047
01:39:28,760 --> 01:39:31,630
...the only thing that stopped me
from calling the men in white coats...

1048
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:34,300
...was when you said
it wasn't about thrill-seeking.

1049
01:39:34,510 --> 01:39:37,510
{\a1\pos(140,288)}- It's not.
- What would you call that?

1050
01:39:39,390 --> 01:39:42,060
{\a1\pos(134,288)}- Damn good television.
- It's a miracle no one was killed.

1051
01:39:42,270 --> 01:39:45,900
I didn't have time to observe
the rules of the road, Alfred.

1052
01:39:46,110 --> 01:39:49,190
You're getting lost inside
this monster of yours.

1053
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:53,780
I'm using this monster to help other people,
just like my father did.

1054
01:39:53,990 --> 01:39:55,530
For Thomas Wayne, helping others...

1055
01:39:55,740 --> 01:39:58,620
...wasn't about proving anything to anyone,
including himself.

1056
01:39:59,120 --> 01:40:02,460
It's Rachel, Alfred. She was dying.

1057
01:40:02,910 --> 01:40:05,500
She's downstairs, sedated.
I need you to take her home.

1058
01:40:05,830 --> 01:40:09,420
Well, we both care for Rachel, sir,
but what you're doing has to be beyond that.

1059
01:40:09,750 --> 01:40:12,630
It can't be personal,
or you're just a vigilante.

1060
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:14,680
{\a1\pos(155,288)}- Is Fox still here?
- Yes, sir.

1061
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:16,510
We need to send these people away now.

1062
01:40:16,720 --> 01:40:19,640
Those are Bruce Wayne's guests out there, sir.
You have a name to maintain.

1063
01:40:19,850 --> 01:40:21,640
I don't care about my name.

1064
01:40:21,850 --> 01:40:24,980
It's not just your name, sir.
It's your father's name.

1065
01:40:26,770 --> 01:40:29,110
And it's all that's left of him.

1066
01:40:31,070 --> 01:40:32,610
Don't destroy it.

1067
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:50,090
{\a1\pos(150,288)}- Mr. Earle.
- Happy birthday, Bruce.

1068
01:40:50,300 --> 01:40:51,670
Thank you.

1069
01:40:52,010 --> 01:40:54,010
How did the stock offering go?

1070
01:40:54,300 --> 01:40:55,470
Prices soared.

1071
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:56,890
Who was buying?

1072
01:40:57,090 --> 01:40:58,970
All kinds of funds and brokerages.

1073
01:40:59,180 --> 01:41:00,850
It's a bit technical.

1074
01:41:01,060 --> 01:41:02,720
The key thing is...

1075
01:41:02,930 --> 01:41:04,890
...our company's future is secure.

1076
01:41:06,770 --> 01:41:07,770
Great.

1077
01:41:21,490 --> 01:41:23,790
A little the worse for wear, I'm afraid.

1078
01:41:29,540 --> 01:41:31,290
What was the plan, Crane?

1079
01:41:31,500 --> 01:41:33,710
How were you gonna get
your toxin into the air?

1080
01:41:34,130 --> 01:41:37,380
Scarecrow. Scarecrow.

1081
01:41:37,590 --> 01:41:39,390
Who were you working for, Crane?

1082
01:41:41,510 --> 01:41:43,680
Oh, it's too late.

1083
01:41:44,310 --> 01:41:46,390
You can't stop it now.

1084
01:41:51,480 --> 01:41:53,020
Here.

1085
01:41:53,190 --> 01:41:55,150
{\a1\pos(150,288)}- Happy birthday, Bruce.
- Thank you. Thanks.

1086
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:58,240
And thank you for that item.

1087
01:41:59,780 --> 01:42:00,990
You're welcome.

1088
01:42:01,200 --> 01:42:03,950
{\a1\pos(135,288)}- I know you'll put it to good use.
- I already have.

1089
01:42:04,240 --> 01:42:08,040
How long would it take
to manufacture on a large scale?

1090
01:42:08,620 --> 01:42:09,710
Weeks. Why?

1091
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:13,040
Somebody's planning to disperse
the toxin using the water supply.

1092
01:42:14,090 --> 01:42:17,130
The water supply won't help you
disperse an inhalant.

1093
01:42:18,090 --> 01:42:19,470
What?

1094
01:42:19,680 --> 01:42:22,180
Unless you have a microwave emitter
powerful enough...

1095
01:42:22,390 --> 01:42:25,220
...to vaporize all the water
in the mains.

1096
01:42:25,680 --> 01:42:28,940
A microwave emitter like the one
Wayne Enterprises just misplaced.

1097
01:42:29,390 --> 01:42:30,560
Misplaced?

1098
01:42:30,770 --> 01:42:34,230
Earle just fired me for asking
too many questions about it.

1099
01:42:36,280 --> 01:42:39,740
I need you to go back to Wayne Enterprises right now
and start making more of that antidote.

1100
01:42:39,950 --> 01:42:43,030
I think the police are gonna need
as much as they can get their hands on. Okay?

1101
01:42:43,240 --> 01:42:45,290
My security clearance
has been revoked.

1102
01:42:45,490 --> 01:42:47,450
That wouldn't stop a man like you now,
would it?

1103
01:42:47,910 --> 01:42:49,580
I suppose not.

1104
01:42:51,670 --> 01:42:56,300
{\a1\pos(110,288)}- Bruce, there's somebody here you simply must meet.
- Not now, Mrs. Delane.

1105
01:42:56,500 --> 01:42:59,340
Now, am I pronouncing this right...

1106
01:42:59,550 --> 01:43:01,970
...Mr. Ra's al Ghul?

1107
01:43:07,640 --> 01:43:09,390
You're not Ra's al Ghul.

1108
01:43:10,980 --> 01:43:12,230
I watched him die.

1109
01:43:12,440 --> 01:43:15,440
But is Ra's al Ghul immortal?

1110
01:43:18,230 --> 01:43:20,650
Are his methods supernatural?

1111
01:43:25,240 --> 01:43:29,620
Or cheap parlor tricks to conceal
your true identity, Ra's?

1112
01:43:31,500 --> 01:43:35,960
Surely a man who spends his nights
scrambling over the rooftops of Gotham...

1113
01:43:36,170 --> 01:43:38,170
...wouldn't begrudge me
dual identities.

1114
01:43:39,050 --> 01:43:40,800
I saved your life.

1115
01:43:41,010 --> 01:43:43,470
I warned you about compassion, Bruce.

1116
01:43:46,680 --> 01:43:48,850
Your quarrel is with me.

1117
01:43:49,770 --> 01:43:52,230
You let these people go.

1118
01:43:52,520 --> 01:43:55,770
You are welcome to explain
the situation to them.

1119
01:43:58,070 --> 01:43:59,650
Everyone.

1120
01:44:00,490 --> 01:44:02,320
Everybody?

1121
01:44:04,950 --> 01:44:06,780
I...

1122
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:11,500
I want to thank you all for coming here
tonight and drinking all of my booze.

1123
01:44:13,620 --> 01:44:15,290
No, really.

1124
01:44:16,380 --> 01:44:19,090
There's a thing about being a Wayne...

1125
01:44:19,300 --> 01:44:22,840
...that you're never short of
a few freeloaders, like yourselves...

1126
01:44:23,050 --> 01:44:26,680
...to fill up your mansion with.
So here's to you people. Thank you.

1127
01:44:26,890 --> 01:44:29,470
{\a1\pos(150,288)}- That's enough, Bruce.
- I'm not finished.

1128
01:44:29,850 --> 01:44:31,520
To all of you...

1129
01:44:31,720 --> 01:44:36,060
All of you phonies,
all of you two-faced friends...

1130
01:44:36,270 --> 01:44:41,320
...you sycophantic suck-ups
who smile through your teeth at me...

1131
01:44:41,530 --> 01:44:45,070
...please, leave me in peace.

1132
01:44:45,280 --> 01:44:47,870
Please go.

1133
01:44:48,240 --> 01:44:51,620
Stop smiling, it's not a joke.
Please leave.

1134
01:44:51,830 --> 01:44:54,000
The party's over, get out.

1135
01:44:54,210 --> 01:44:57,420
The apple has fallen very far
from the tree, Mr. Wayne.

1136
01:45:02,300 --> 01:45:04,550
He's turning into a jerk.

1137
01:45:10,890 --> 01:45:12,600
Amusing.

1138
01:45:12,930 --> 01:45:16,350
But pointless.
None of these people have long to live.

1139
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:20,020
Your antics at the asylum
have forced my hand.

1140
01:45:20,230 --> 01:45:22,360
So Crane was working for you.

1141
01:45:22,570 --> 01:45:26,360
His toxin is derived from the organic
compound found in our blue flowers.

1142
01:45:26,740 --> 01:45:28,740
He was able to weaponize it.

1143
01:45:28,950 --> 01:45:30,910
He's not a member of
the League of Shadows?

1144
01:45:31,120 --> 01:45:35,620
Of course not. He thought our plan
was to hold the city to ransom.

1145
01:45:36,370 --> 01:45:40,880
But really, you are gonna release
Crane's poison on the entire city.

1146
01:45:41,090 --> 01:45:45,090
Then watch Gotham tear itself apart
through fear.

1147
01:45:57,980 --> 01:45:59,850
You're gonna destroy millions of lives.

1148
01:46:00,100 --> 01:46:03,400
Only a cynical man would call
what these people have "lives," Wayne.

1149
01:46:03,610 --> 01:46:05,400
Crime. Despair.

1150
01:46:05,610 --> 01:46:07,650
This is not how man
was supposed to live.

1151
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:11,450
The League of Shadows has been
a check against human corruption...

1152
01:46:11,660 --> 01:46:13,120
...for thousands of years.

1153
01:46:13,330 --> 01:46:16,870
We sacked Rome.
Loaded trade ships with plague rats.

1154
01:46:17,080 --> 01:46:18,460
Burned London to the ground.

1155
01:46:18,670 --> 01:46:21,460
Every time a civilization reaches
the pinnacle of its decadence...

1156
01:46:21,670 --> 01:46:23,590
...we return to restore the balance.

1157
01:46:23,800 --> 01:46:25,340
Gotham isn't beyond saving.

1158
01:46:26,670 --> 01:46:29,340
Give me more time.
There are good people here.

1159
01:46:29,550 --> 01:46:31,340
You're defending a city so corrupt...

1160
01:46:31,550 --> 01:46:34,680
...we have infiltrated
every level of its infrastructure.

1161
01:46:45,820 --> 01:46:47,150
Time to play.

1162
01:46:51,360 --> 01:46:54,030
When I found you in that jail,
you were lost.

1163
01:46:54,200 --> 01:46:56,290
But I believed in you.

1164
01:46:56,490 --> 01:47:00,210
I took away your fear,
and I showed you a path.

1165
01:47:00,500 --> 01:47:02,710
You were my greatest student.

1166
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:06,170
It should be you standing by my side,
saving the world.

1167
01:47:07,010 --> 01:47:09,590
I'll be standing where I belong.

1168
01:47:10,260 --> 01:47:13,340
Between you
and the people of Gotham.

1169
01:47:15,050 --> 01:47:17,640
No one can save Gotham.

1170
01:47:21,020 --> 01:47:25,650
When a forest grows too wild,
a purging fire is inevitable and natural.

1171
01:47:26,900 --> 01:47:31,530
Tomorrow the world will watch in horror
as its greatest city destroys itself.

1172
01:47:32,110 --> 01:47:35,330
The movement back to harmony
will be unstoppable this time.

1173
01:47:35,660 --> 01:47:37,830
{\a1\pos(140,288)}- You attacked Gotham before?
- Of course.

1174
01:47:38,080 --> 01:47:40,750
Over the ages our weapons
have grown more sophisticated.

1175
01:47:40,910 --> 01:47:43,750
With Gotham we tried a new one.
Economics.

1176
01:47:44,210 --> 01:47:48,880
But we underestimated certain
of Gotham's citizens...

1177
01:47:49,340 --> 01:47:51,510
...such as your parents.

1178
01:47:55,600 --> 01:47:59,060
Gunned down by one of the very people
they were trying to help.

1179
01:47:59,350 --> 01:48:02,100
Create enough hunger
and everyone becomes a criminal.

1180
01:48:02,310 --> 01:48:04,730
Their deaths galvanized the city
into saving itself...

1181
01:48:04,940 --> 01:48:07,610
...and Gotham has limped on
ever since.

1182
01:48:07,820 --> 01:48:09,570
We are back to finish the job.

1183
01:48:10,320 --> 01:48:13,530
And this time no misguided idealists
will get in the way.

1184
01:48:13,740 --> 01:48:17,280
Like your father, you lack the courage
to do all that is necessary.

1185
01:48:17,620 --> 01:48:20,450
If someone stands in the way
of true justice...

1186
01:48:20,660 --> 01:48:24,710
...you simply walk up behind them
and stab them in the heart.

1187
01:48:29,750 --> 01:48:31,880
{\a1\pos(150,288)}- I am gonna stop you.
- You never did learn...

1188
01:48:32,090 --> 01:48:34,090
...to mind your surroundings.

1189
01:48:36,300 --> 01:48:38,260
Justice is balance.

1190
01:48:38,470 --> 01:48:40,600
You burned my house
and left me for dead.

1191
01:48:43,310 --> 01:48:45,440
Consider us even.

1192
01:49:01,870 --> 01:49:03,580
No one comes out. Make sure.

1193
01:49:13,510 --> 01:49:14,970
They're all gone?

1194
01:49:15,130 --> 01:49:17,890
{\a1\pos(135,288)}- How many from maximum security?
- Every one of them.

1195
01:49:18,050 --> 01:49:19,800
Serial killers, rapists.

1196
01:49:20,050 --> 01:49:22,890
Get them to raise the bridges.
We don't want any getting off the island.

1197
01:49:23,060 --> 01:49:24,480
Yeah, I'll raise the bridges...

1198
01:49:24,680 --> 01:49:28,900
...when I get every available unit out here
to catch the homicidal maniacs...

1199
01:49:29,110 --> 01:49:31,940
{\a1\pos(130,288)}- ...that are running loose out there.
- Come on!

1200
01:49:55,170 --> 01:49:57,930
I hope you're not a member
of the fire brigade.

1201
01:50:03,930 --> 01:50:06,020
Master Wayne! Master Wayne!

1202
01:50:10,560 --> 01:50:14,900
What is the point of all those pushups
if you can't even lift a bloody log?

1203
01:50:53,400 --> 01:50:55,440
What have I done, Alfred?

1204
01:50:56,480 --> 01:50:58,400
Everything my family...

1205
01:50:58,610 --> 01:51:00,490
...my father, built...

1206
01:51:02,910 --> 01:51:06,790
The Wayne legacy is more
than bricks and mortar, sir.

1207
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,210
I wanted to save Gotham.

1208
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:11,920
I failed.

1209
01:51:13,170 --> 01:51:14,420
Why do we fall, sir?

1210
01:51:17,630 --> 01:51:21,090
So that we can learn
to pick ourselves up.

1211
01:51:23,600 --> 01:51:25,720
You still haven't given up on me?

1212
01:51:27,640 --> 01:51:29,100
Never.

1213
01:51:30,180 --> 01:51:31,480
Down!

1214
01:51:31,690 --> 01:51:34,560
Harassment! I see harassment!

1215
01:51:34,770 --> 01:51:36,820
Maybe you'd like to see
some excessive force?

1216
01:51:37,030 --> 01:51:38,900
Madman with a gun.

1217
01:51:40,110 --> 01:51:43,410
With residents furious at the
unprecedented show of police strength...

1218
01:51:43,620 --> 01:51:46,990
{\a1\pos(115,288)}- ...to round up the inmates, the situation...
- Woah, lady! We're about to raise these bridges.

1219
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:50,790
Officer, I am a Gotham City district attorney.
Let me pass.

1220
01:51:58,210 --> 01:52:00,470
{\a1\pos(150,288)}- Just shut up!
- Hey, Flass, cool it!

1221
01:52:00,670 --> 01:52:01,930
Hold these people back.

1222
01:52:02,130 --> 01:52:05,090
Hey, Gordon.
Somebody here to see you.

1223
01:52:05,300 --> 01:52:07,680
{\a1\pos(130,288)}- What are you doing here?
- Our mutual friend sent me with this.

1224
01:52:07,890 --> 01:52:09,310
It counteracts Crane's toxin.

1225
01:52:09,520 --> 01:52:10,980
Hopefully you won't need it.

1226
01:52:11,180 --> 01:52:14,310
Not unless he's got some way
of getting that crap into the air.

1227
01:52:15,480 --> 01:52:17,900
All right, last one across.

1228
01:52:18,610 --> 01:52:22,490
People, they want this bridge up
in no more than three minutes!

1229
01:52:22,740 --> 01:52:26,070
Better get you off the island before
they raise the bridges. Patrolman!

1230
01:52:26,740 --> 01:52:27,740
Go!

1231
01:52:54,560 --> 01:52:56,350
I can't find my mom.

1232
01:52:56,730 --> 01:52:58,190
Hey!

1233
01:53:06,610 --> 01:53:08,320
What the hell are you doing?

1234
01:53:09,870 --> 01:53:11,410
Gentlemen...

1235
01:53:11,870 --> 01:53:14,370
...time to spread the word.

1236
01:53:16,120 --> 01:53:17,500
And the word is...

1237
01:53:18,790 --> 01:53:20,500
...panic.

1238
01:53:44,610 --> 01:53:46,200
Jesus. The pressure, it's spiking.

1239
01:53:47,240 --> 01:53:48,530
Right there.

1240
01:53:48,870 --> 01:53:51,080
That water main
is right under the Narrows.

1241
01:54:08,050 --> 01:54:09,590
It's okay.

1242
01:54:42,460 --> 01:54:43,960
This is Commissioner Loeb.

1243
01:54:44,170 --> 01:54:45,840
Come on, somebody talk to me.

1244
01:54:46,050 --> 01:54:47,470
Come on!

1245
01:55:07,190 --> 01:55:09,200
Loeb, Loeb. This is Gordon.

1246
01:55:09,530 --> 01:55:10,820
What the hell is going on?

1247
01:55:11,030 --> 01:55:14,450
We need reinforcements.
TAC teams, SWAT, riot cops!

1248
01:55:14,660 --> 01:55:18,830
Gordon! All the city's riot police
are on the island with you!

1249
01:55:19,040 --> 01:55:21,040
Well, they're completely incapacitated!

1250
01:55:21,370 --> 01:55:25,340
It's okay, it's okay.
No one's gonna hurt you.

1251
01:55:26,210 --> 01:55:27,840
Of course they are!

1252
01:55:28,050 --> 01:55:31,010
{\a1\pos(160,288)}- Crane?
- No. Scarecrow.

1253
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:34,180
Gordon...

1254
01:55:34,390 --> 01:55:36,600
...there's nobody left to send in.

1255
01:55:38,180 --> 01:55:39,850
So I'm on my own?

1256
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:45,610
The Narrows is tearing itself to pieces.

1257
01:55:45,820 --> 01:55:48,360
This is just the beginning.
If they hit the whole city with toxin...

1258
01:55:48,570 --> 01:55:51,280
...there's nothing to stop Gotham
tearing itself apart from mass panic.

1259
01:55:51,490 --> 01:55:53,360
{\a1\pos(140,288)}- How are they gonna do that?
- They'll be using the train.

1260
01:55:53,570 --> 01:55:57,370
The monorail follows the water mains to
the central hub beneath Wayne Tower.

1261
01:55:57,580 --> 01:55:59,250
If they get the machine into Wayne station...

1262
01:55:59,450 --> 01:56:02,920
...it'll cause a chain reaction
that'll vaporize the entire city's water supply.

1263
01:56:03,120 --> 01:56:04,670
Covering Gotham in this poison.

1264
01:56:04,880 --> 01:56:08,050
I'm gonna stop him from loading that train,
but I may need your help.

1265
01:56:08,250 --> 01:56:10,010
{\a1\pos(150,288)}- What do you need?
- Can you drive stick?

1266
01:56:16,300 --> 01:56:17,930
There you are!

1267
01:56:18,140 --> 01:56:20,100
There is nothing to fear...

1268
01:56:20,310 --> 01:56:22,020
...but fear itself!

1269
01:56:23,100 --> 01:56:25,400
I am here to help!

1270
01:56:56,640 --> 01:56:58,760
Batman will save us. He'll come.

1271
01:57:04,020 --> 01:57:05,900
{\a1\pos(170,288)}- He'll come.
- Don't peek.

1272
01:57:14,570 --> 01:57:17,910
This is Gordon.
Prepare to lower the bridge.

1273
01:57:23,830 --> 01:57:25,920
I told you he'd come.

1274
01:57:30,960 --> 01:57:32,550
Wait.

1275
01:57:33,550 --> 01:57:35,130
You could die.

1276
01:57:35,340 --> 01:57:36,590
At least tell me your name.

1277
01:57:42,020 --> 01:57:44,180
It's not who I am underneath...

1278
01:57:45,180 --> 01:57:49,480
...but what I do that defines me.

1279
01:57:49,860 --> 01:57:51,150
Bruce?

1280
01:58:24,890 --> 01:58:28,190
Well, well. You took my advice
about theatricality a bit literally.

1281
01:58:28,390 --> 01:58:30,860
{\a1\pos(135,288)}- It ends here.
- For you and the police, maybe.

1282
01:58:31,060 --> 01:58:33,360
My fight, however,
lies with the rest of Gotham.

1283
01:58:33,570 --> 01:58:36,860
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a city to destroy.

1284
01:58:37,070 --> 01:58:40,740
{\a1\pos(135,288)}- I can't beat two of your pawns?
- As you wish.

1285
01:58:53,590 --> 01:58:55,880
GPS online.

1286
01:59:02,760 --> 01:59:04,930
In 100 yards.

1287
01:59:35,840 --> 01:59:37,090
Gentlemen.

1288
02:00:04,530 --> 02:00:06,740
Who the hell authorized this?

1289
02:00:17,340 --> 02:00:19,380
Distance to Wayne Tower, three miles.

1290
02:00:26,680 --> 02:00:29,270
The pressure's moving along the mains,
blowing the pipes.

1291
02:00:29,470 --> 02:00:30,810
If that pressure reaches us...

1292
02:00:31,020 --> 02:00:33,980
...the water supply right across
the whole city is gonna blow!

1293
02:00:44,490 --> 02:00:47,330
At the next intersection, turn right.

1294
02:01:12,060 --> 02:01:13,520
You will never learn.

1295
02:01:21,070 --> 02:01:22,070
Sorry.

1296
02:01:26,070 --> 02:01:29,030
{\a1\pos(130,288)}- Familiar. Don't you have anything new?
- How about this?!

1297
02:01:45,840 --> 02:01:48,090
You have arrived at Wayne Tower.

1298
02:02:01,440 --> 02:02:02,650
Evacuate the building.

1299
02:02:02,900 --> 02:02:05,360
We're right on top of the main hub
and it's gonna blow.

1300
02:02:14,290 --> 02:02:16,460
Weapons system activated.

1301
02:02:20,590 --> 02:02:21,590
Nice ride.

1302
02:02:36,850 --> 02:02:37,850
Armed.

1303
02:02:49,820 --> 02:02:51,280
Don't be afraid, Bruce.

1304
02:02:54,080 --> 02:02:55,450
Come on. Come on.

1305
02:03:00,210 --> 02:03:02,250
You are just an ordinary man in a cape.

1306
02:03:02,460 --> 02:03:06,300
That's why you couldn't fight injustice,
that's why you can't stop this train.

1307
02:03:06,510 --> 02:03:09,050
Who said anything about stopping it?

1308
02:03:14,890 --> 02:03:16,390
Yes!

1309
02:03:24,610 --> 02:03:27,990
You never learned
to mind your surroundings!

1310
02:03:35,870 --> 02:03:38,330
Have you finally learned to do
what is necessary?

1311
02:03:38,660 --> 02:03:40,920
I won't kill you...

1312
02:03:45,380 --> 02:03:47,510
...but I don't have to save you.

1313
02:05:02,710 --> 02:05:05,750
{\a1\pos(135,288)}- The meeting's already started.
- What meeting?

1314
02:05:10,050 --> 02:05:12,920
Fox, I seem to remember firing you.

1315
02:05:13,470 --> 02:05:15,010
You did.

1316
02:05:15,220 --> 02:05:17,260
I got another job.

1317
02:05:18,140 --> 02:05:19,600
Yours.

1318
02:05:20,060 --> 02:05:21,720
On whose authority?

1319
02:05:22,390 --> 02:05:24,270
Batman may have made
the front page...

1320
02:05:24,520 --> 02:05:27,400
...but Bruce Wayne
got pushed to page eight.

1321
02:05:34,240 --> 02:05:35,240
Bruce Wayne.

1322
02:05:35,450 --> 02:05:39,200
What makes you think you can decide
who's running Wayne Enterprises?

1323
02:05:39,410 --> 02:05:42,120
{\a1\pos(140,288)}- The fact that I'm the owner.
- What are you talking about?

1324
02:05:42,410 --> 02:05:44,290
The company went public a week ago.

1325
02:05:44,500 --> 02:05:45,960
And I bought most of the shares.

1326
02:05:46,330 --> 02:05:49,750
Through various charitable foundations
and trusts and so forth.

1327
02:05:49,960 --> 02:05:53,130
Look, it's all a bit technical,
but the important thing...

1328
02:05:53,380 --> 02:05:56,630
...is that my company's future
is secure.

1329
02:05:57,050 --> 02:05:58,430
Right, Mr. Fox?

1330
02:05:58,640 --> 02:06:00,430
Right you are, Mr. Wayne.

1331
02:06:02,680 --> 02:06:04,230
Didn't you get the memo?

1332
02:06:23,200 --> 02:06:26,370
{\a1\pos(130,288)}- I'm sorry I didn't tell you, Rachel.
- No. No, Bruce...

1333
02:06:26,580 --> 02:06:27,920
...I'm sorry.

1334
02:06:28,830 --> 02:06:31,500
The day that Chill died, I...

1335
02:06:33,380 --> 02:06:34,960
I said terrible things.

1336
02:06:35,510 --> 02:06:37,220
But true things.

1337
02:06:37,880 --> 02:06:39,680
I was a coward with a gun...

1338
02:06:39,890 --> 02:06:43,640
...and justice is about more
than revenge, so thank you.

1339
02:06:44,720 --> 02:06:47,390
I never stopped thinking about you.

1340
02:06:48,900 --> 02:06:50,480
About us.

1341
02:06:51,150 --> 02:06:53,070
And when I heard you were back, I...

1342
02:06:53,940 --> 02:06:56,110
I started to hope.

1343
02:07:20,220 --> 02:07:22,890
But then I found out about your mask.

1344
02:07:24,100 --> 02:07:26,890
Batman's just a symbol, Rachel.

1345
02:07:27,560 --> 02:07:29,190
No. This...

1346
02:07:30,400 --> 02:07:32,060
...is your mask.

1347
02:07:34,070 --> 02:07:37,570
Your real face is the one
that criminals now fear.

1348
02:07:38,440 --> 02:07:40,410
The man I loved...

1349
02:07:41,160 --> 02:07:42,570
...the man who vanished...

1350
02:07:43,830 --> 02:07:45,950
...he never came back at all.

1351
02:07:50,460 --> 02:07:53,130
But maybe he's still
out there somewhere.

1352
02:07:55,300 --> 02:07:58,970
Maybe someday,
when Gotham no longer needs Batman...

1353
02:08:00,050 --> 02:08:01,970
...I'll see him again.

1354
02:08:13,060 --> 02:08:15,940
{\a1\pos(140,288)}- Proved me wrong, you know.
- About what?

1355
02:08:18,820 --> 02:08:21,240
Your father would be
very proud of you.

1356
02:08:21,490 --> 02:08:23,070
Just like me.

1357
02:08:50,100 --> 02:08:51,940
What will you do?

1358
02:08:53,350 --> 02:08:54,900
Rebuild it.

1359
02:08:55,810 --> 02:08:58,150
Just the way it was, brick for brick.

1360
02:09:05,030 --> 02:09:06,240
Just the way it was, sir?

1361
02:09:08,370 --> 02:09:09,580
Yeah, why?

1362
02:09:09,790 --> 02:09:12,580
I thought this might be
a good opportunity for...

1363
02:09:12,790 --> 02:09:15,210
...improving the foundations.

1364
02:09:15,420 --> 02:09:18,340
{\a1\pos(140,288)}- In the southeast corner?
- Precisely, sir.

1365
02:09:34,060 --> 02:09:36,900
{\a1\pos(135,288)}- Nice.
- I couldn't find any mob bosses.

1366
02:09:37,900 --> 02:09:40,570
{\a1\pos(150,288)}- Well, sergeant?
- It's "lieutenant" now.

1367
02:09:40,940 --> 02:09:42,400
You really started something.

1368
02:09:42,610 --> 02:09:44,570
Bent cops running scared.

1369
02:09:44,780 --> 02:09:46,160
Hope on the streets.

1370
02:09:46,450 --> 02:09:50,030
{\a1\pos(150,288)}- But?
- The Narrows is lost.

1371
02:09:50,580 --> 02:09:54,410
And we still haven't picked up Crane or
half the inmates of Arkham that he freed.

1372
02:09:55,120 --> 02:09:56,710
We will.

1373
02:09:56,960 --> 02:09:58,590
We can bring Gotham back.

1374
02:09:58,790 --> 02:10:01,250
{\a1\pos(150,288)}- What about escalation?
- Escalation?

1375
02:10:01,460 --> 02:10:05,760
We start carrying semiautomatics,
they buy automatics.

1376
02:10:05,970 --> 02:10:10,260
We start wearing Kevlar,
they buy armor-piercing rounds.

1377
02:10:10,470 --> 02:10:13,730
{\a1\pos(140,288)}- And?
- And you're wearing a mask...

1378
02:10:14,180 --> 02:10:16,020
...and jumping off rooftops.

1379
02:10:17,480 --> 02:10:19,480
Now, take this guy.

1380
02:10:19,770 --> 02:10:21,770
Armed robbery, double homicide.

1381
02:10:21,980 --> 02:10:25,200
Got a taste for the theatrical, like you.

1382
02:10:25,490 --> 02:10:27,410
Leaves a calling card.

1383
02:10:33,330 --> 02:10:35,120
I'll look into it.

1384
02:10:38,630 --> 02:10:40,080
I never said thank you.

1385
02:10:45,170 --> 02:10:47,220
And you'll never have to.
