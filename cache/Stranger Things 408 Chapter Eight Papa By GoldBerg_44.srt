when I stumbled on her in the woods,

I knew… I knew that was him.

He was sending us a message,

And this creature wasn't alone.

There were so many monsters.

358

He's a number like Eleven,

only a sick, evil, male, child-murdering
version of her with really bad skin.

436
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,340
But my… my point is, he's super powerful.

437
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:42,390
Could turn us inside out with a snap
of his fingers. It's not a fair fight.

438
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:43,970
<font color="#138ce9">DUSTIN:</font> Then why fight fair?

439
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:47,390
You're right. He's like Eleven.
But that gives <i>us</i> an upper hand.

440
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,140

441
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:51,270

she goes into
this sort of trance-like state.

445
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:59,400
I bet the same is true of Vecna.

446
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:01,620
That would explain
what he was doing in that attic.

447
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,080
Exactly. When he attacks his next victim,

448
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,620
I'll bet you he's back in that attic,
physical body defenseless.

449
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,790
Defenseless? What about the army of bats?

450
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:12,130
True. We'll have to find a way past them.

451

- No idea.

They were at… They were at Max's house.

They're planning to kill him.

when One kills, he doesn't simply kill.

He takes everything from his victims.

Everything they are

And we do not know
where he's been these lost years.

639

But if he has survived this long,

we can only assume

641
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:43,590
that he has grown in strength.

642
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,930
To underestimate him,

00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:48,840
to act rashly,

You will need to do more than run.

I can call Stinson. She's got connections
at Nellis. That's two hours away.

00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:39,020
And if we hustle, I'll bet we can be
in Hawkins before nightfall.

662
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,520
That would be a grave mistake.

663
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,860
Waiting would be an even greater mistake.

664
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,280
What if One makes his move

665
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,490
before we've had a chance
to throw a punch?

666
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:48,110
Then what is the point of all this?

667
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,200
That's a risk we're going to have to take.

668
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,410
We pushed her before
and look what happened.

669
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:56,950
She lifted a 10,000-pound tank
into the goddamn air.

670
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,910
You don't understand what he's capable of!

671
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,880
Maybe you're right.
Or maybe you are overestimating him.

672
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:05,500
Either way, doesn't matter
because this is not our choice.

673
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:07,670
We agreed this was not gonna be a prison.

674
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,010
We'll show her what this is,

what we can offer,

676
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:14,010
and then it is her choice
whether she wants to stay or go.

Right, Doc?

two of the three of Vecna's victims
were seeing Ms. Kelley, right?

- Yeah.
- Okay.

So I figure there's a good chance
Vecna cursed another one of her students.

722
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:03,020
We go back to her office.
We read all of her files.

Look for mentions of headaches,
nosebleeds, nightmares.

00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:08,520
- We identify his most likely next victim.
- Lucas.

725
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,240
- We stake out his house...
- Lucas, stop.

726
00:42:10,810 --> 00:42:12,900
We don't have time for any of that, okay?

727
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,530
And even if we did,

728
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,490
even if your plan did work,

729
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,910

what they're up against.

731
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:24,870
I do.

732
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,920
He uses my memories against me.

733
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:32,340
But… only my darkest memories.

734
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:35,670
- Same with Chrissy and Fred, right?
- Right.

735
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,300
It's like he only sees the darkness in us.

736
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:43,640
So, I'll just run
in the opposite direction.

737
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:46,810
Run to the light.

to find me there.

740
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:54,690
Now, how exactly
do you plan on doing this?

was a building and not a small woman?

It's not a small woman.

Yes, they're right.

- She's a genius, Jonathan.

- Well, she didn't.

she could fit behind a small tree.
