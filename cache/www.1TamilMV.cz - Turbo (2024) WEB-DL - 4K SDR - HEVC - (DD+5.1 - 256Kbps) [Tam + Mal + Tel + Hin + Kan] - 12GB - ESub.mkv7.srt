Are you out here to die?

Come on. Get in.

Shut up, you cheat!

when I was in trouble!

-Sorry, Chettayi!
-Give it to me!

I'm so stressed that
I won't sleep tonight without a drink!

Why are there more lights
in front of my house?

560
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,600
Did that old hag set the house on fire
because she was mad at me?

561

I didn't go there. Why fish more trouble?

turn out to be the villain here?

Well, no point in blaming him.

00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,960
And you are teaching me rules?!

717
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,400
-Relax and come, sir.
-Let go of me!

718
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,760
Denying me a loan? I'll show you!

719
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,480
Where do these people come from?

720
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:40,640
When you enter an office,
you should have some dignity, right?

721
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,680
My dear Jose, I told you
the location of my bank by mistake!

722
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,800
And you're already here?

723
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:48,040
How can you say such things?

724
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,120
We came to an agreement last night

725
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,800
about returning to Kerala today.

726
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,600
Yet you left without telling me?

727
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,360
Don't you know my situation, Jose?

728
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,480
I've irked my whole family,

729
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,880
what excuse should I tell them
if I go back there?

730
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,240
That my boyfriend dumped me?

731
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,720
But how can you say that?
What will I tell my mom?

732
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,360
Call your mom. Let me talk to her.

733
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,080
Mom won't believe that.

734
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,720
She'll say I pushed you to say it.

735
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,520
Mom won't trust me until the cops
confirm that you reached back home.

736
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,920
That's not gonna work.

737
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,040
Catch the next bus and go back home.

738
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,400
You don't know this place well.

739
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,760
Better to avoid wandering here.

740
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,040
That's not gonna work, girl.

741
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,240
For me to step foot to Idukki,
you must be with me.

742
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,480
I've already told you
whatever I have to say.

743
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,680
Now, you may please leave.

744
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,480
Dare you talk to me in English!

745
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:32,000
Since this is a bank,
I'm keeping it cool and humble

746
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,360
and it doesn't work for her!

747
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,360
I'll just...

748
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,080
You're not my dad or brother
to show such responsibility!

749
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,440
I put up with you all night yesterday,
thinking you were innocent.

750
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,600
What will you do if I don't come with you?

751
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,880
I hunt down wild bison
weighing over 2000 kilograms,

752
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,760
and carry the whole animal all by myself.

753
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,680
Compared to them,
you're as puny as a poppy seed.

754
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:53,480
Taking you with me would be
a piece of cake. Wait and watch!

755
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,280
-Please come, sir.
-Go away!

756
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,600
Don't you touch me!
Don't you dare touch Jose!

757
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,520
No wonder why people cuss you out!

758
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,320
You're just pure evil!

759
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,880
Ammachi, I'm in Chennai now.

760
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,120
She is perfectly fine.

761
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,720
She even rejoined her job.

762
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,520
I don't wanna know all that.

763
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,760
Don't come here
until that girl gets back home.

764
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,280
I'd instead end up dead on the streets
of this unfamiliar city!

765
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,760
Yeah. I'll conduct your funeral
there itself, then.

766
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,720
Brother, you want a room?
It's just 300 rupees.

767
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,720
-Bro, you got 'Muri'?
-What?!

768
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,720
-Room? Room?
-Yeah.

769
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,240
-You got?
-Yes.

770
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,440
-Is hot water available?
-Yes. Hot water.

771
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,760
-Available 24 hours.
-Okay.

772
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,160
You said hot water would be available 24/7,
but there's no water at all!

773
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,640
The corporation water tanker
hasn't come today, sir.

774
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,880
How do I take a bath then?

775
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,200
Even I didn't take a bath.

776
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,000
Huh? But what about the boy's claims?

777
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,520
That hot water is available 24 hours.

778
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,240
If the boy said so, ask him!

779
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,440
Damn it!

780
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,520
Give me my money back.
I'll go take a bath elsewhere.

781
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,760
Sir...

782
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,280
No refund.

783
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,840
No refund?

784
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:04,760
Yeah.

785
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,040
No refund, huh?

786
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,040
[NUNGAMBAKKAM POLICE STATION]

787
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,000
He beat me
because he didn't get hot water!

788
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,280
Did he use any weapons?

789
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,440
Excuse me, sir.

790
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,760
I'm Indulekha. I was summoned here.

791
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,200
Yes. Please sit.

792
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,800
Madam...

793
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,200
Do you know him?

794
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,880
When I asked him,

795
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,040
he said you're the only person he knows
in Chennai.

796
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,480
Madam, you work at ICB bank, right?

797
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,600
Yes.

798
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,000
You do this.

799
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,680
Pay 10,000 rupees to the complainant,

800
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,960
and another 15,000 rupees to me

801
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,320
for not filing a case.

802
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,000
Madam...

803
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,360
You shouldn't pay it here.

804
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,720
There are cameras around us.

805
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,840
You do this.

806
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,640
There's a head constable officer
in front of the bathroom.

807
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:05,000
He'll give you the Google pay number.
Pay him the money.

808
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,480
Okay.

809
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,360
And madam, he shouldn't cause
any trouble from now on.

810
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,920
If he does, you'll be held responsible.

811
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,240
Wait up, girl.

812
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,000
I didn't start it this time.

813
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,800
As I looked new to the town,
they tried to scam me.

814
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,000
They offered hot water,
but not even running water was there!

815
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,640
When I asked for a refund,
he tried to assault me.

816
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,240
Will I just take it?
I gave him a handful in return!

817
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,840
I didn't cause any trouble.
I'm on the fair side here.

818
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:28,360
My dear Jose,
I'm saying this because I care for you.

819
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,480
Some bad stuff went down,

820
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,080
but neither of us is to blame.

821
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,600
Forget about it all.

822
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,560
Don't stay here and get into more trouble.

823
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:39,080
With your nature,
more such problems are sure to follow.

824
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,200
I won't come and help you
if you cause any more trouble.

825
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,360
I've got work to do!

826
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,640
This is the first and the last.

827
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,440
Yes. My plan was to catch a bus
tonight itself.

828
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,960
But I had a long journey.

829
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,640
Shouldn't I at least take a bath?

830
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,360
Oh!

831
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,160
-Did you eat anything?
-No!

832
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,360
Come with me then. Hop on.

833
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,160
-How much?
-30 rupees, madam.

834
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,600
Here you go.

835
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,000
What's the news back home?

836
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,840
It's such a hot mess there.

837
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,640
Two of them are still at the hospital.

838
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,080
A police case has been filed.

839
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,520
And uncle and brother are raging in fury.

840
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,840
I barely managed to escape from there.

841
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,600
I can't miss my exams, after all!

842
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,760
And yeah, I met Jerry on the flight.

843
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,520
Yes, I talked to him.

844
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,680
What's wrong with it?

845
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,880
I don't see anything gravely wrong
in whatever he did.

846
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:34,080
If you show up at his home
without prior notice, what can he do?

847
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,920
And don't you know that

848
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,960
his dad is a heart patient?

849
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,880
He had already suffered two heart attacks.

850
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,880
Thank goodness he didn't get his third

851
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,360
when you barged in that night!

852
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,760
I see! You're here
after stirring up all this chaos!

853
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,960
What was even the need for all this?

854
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,600
Jerry says he'll kill you
if he sees you ever again!

855
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,320
What to say, girl? It all just happened.

856
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,360
-So, off I go.
-Wait. Keep this.

857
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,680
Get a new pair of clothes.

858
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,720
And there's enough for the food
and the bus ticket.

859
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,240
Oh, I don't need your money.

860
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,720
Just make a phone call,
money will reach me via 'Google'!

861
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,000
Well...

862
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,720
You're taking it back the moment I refuse?

863
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,280
Can't you insist?
Push a bit, and I'll take it!

864
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,560
Keep it!

865
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,000
That's all!

866
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,880
-[Doorbell rings]
-Alright then.

867
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:28,200
So, you lovers have a word.

868
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,040
I don't want to be a third wheel.

869
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,360
Listen to me, Indu.

870
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,200
I agree that you felt terrible.

871
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,520
But why aren't you trying to
understand my situation?

872
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,080
We've discussed this several times.

873
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,160
We decided
to register our marriage privately

874
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,440
to avoid complications
with our families finding out.

875
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,120
Didn't I tell you that

876
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,440
I'd handle it, even if
your engagement goes ahead?

877
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:53,400
Why did you leave your home
when that dimwit Jose chettayi ask you to?

878
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,480
Why aren't you saying anything?

879
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:03,600
I left my home for you,
yet you said you don't know me.

880
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,200
-I forgive you for that.
-Okay!

881
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,720
After I left your home,

882
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:09,400
you didn't come looking for me that night.

883
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,280
-I forgive you for that too.
-Okay.

884
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,920
But who are 'Indu Tinder'
and 'Indu Bumble'?

885
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,000
Eh?!

886
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,120
That...

887
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,400
I don't know!

888
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,720
Don't you know?

889
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,400
[Indu slaps Jerry]

890
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,480
Oh no! Is this what they mean
by 'nowhere to go'?

891
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,000
I'm such a walking jinx!

892
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,080
You were here, Jose chettayi?

893
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,040
I...  just...

894
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,120
I went to take a leak.

895
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,240
Near the temple?

896
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:49,520
That's why I came back.

897
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,440
-Jose chettayi...
-What happened?

898
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:54,280
Was it you who told her
about the girls in my contact list?

899
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:57,680
Dear...  I just went with the flow
and blurted it out.

900
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:58,600
Ugh!

901
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,360
What kind of a person are you?

902
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:03,400
Those are things of the past,
long before I met her.

903
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,960
-Sorry, dear. Sorry.
-Shut up!

904
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:07,760
Hey...  Sorry. Hey!

905
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,560
Jose chettayi, what did she say?

906
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,560
Things are messed up here.

907
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,560
In short, I'm on the streets.

908
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:19,600
I'm coming back.

909
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:22,760
Chennai streets are better than
the jail here.

910
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,280
If you come here,
the cops will arrest you for sure.

911
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,920
They will remand you for 15 days.

912
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:28,120
Arrest me?

913
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,160
But what did I even do?

914
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,520
That girl has agreed to tell the cops that

915
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,360
she came with me willingly.

916
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,000
Why don't you understand?

917
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:37,640
That's not gonna fix anything.

918
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,960
Trespassing and assault are also added
in the FIR.

919
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,840
House-breaking and attempt to murder.

920
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,280
They are unbailable offences!

921
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,600
Plus, her family is connected
with the SP officer,

922
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,000
and he's putting pressure on me.

923
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,080
Uh-oh! One hell of a tight spot!
What a pain!

924
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,560
Whatever you say, don't come here

925
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,240
until the situation clears up.

926
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:58,640
At what cursed moment
did this wretched idea cross my mind?!

927
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,480
What's wrong with all of you?

928
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:04,760
God! The RMO!

929
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:06,120
I just can't wrap my head around it.

930
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,640
Is this a kindergarten or something?

931
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:09,920
Sithu...  How's the weather?

932
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,040
As usual, she's furious.

933
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:15,440
Jerry?

934
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,080
I want all of this done in one hour.

935
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,560
Now, why are you standing
and staring at me? Leave!

936
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:21,720
-Madam?
-Okay, Madam.

937
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,040
Good afternoon

938
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:28,120
Is this the time
you come to the office, Jerry?

939
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,240
You are the branch manager.
What's your explanation?

940
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:33,320
You're not gonna give me
all this kind of nonsense!

941
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:35,720
What the hell have all of you
been doing here?

942
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,120
I guess she's completely lost it.
She was swearing like a trumpet!

943
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,360
Deposit that money back, Jerry.

944
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:58,920
Huh? What money?

945
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,160
Seventy lakh rupees has been transferred

946
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,240
to this account using your passkey.

947
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:05,720
It was done manually, not online.

948
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:09,000
Once caught, you'll rot in prison
for the rest of your life.

949
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,320
It's not a joke!

950
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:11,920
Hey...

951
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:13,600
What are you rambling on about?

952
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:14,840
Don't you know?

953
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:15,920
Sithu...

954
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:18,080
Stop scaring me and tell me the matter.

955
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,360
Tell me!

956
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:24,080
When you were on leave
for the church feast,

957
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,760
a family visited our branch.

958
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:29,800
Venkatesh, a distributor
at some tyre company.

959
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,080
-Hello, madam.
-Yes. sir.

960
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:35,600
I'm Venkatesh. She's my wife, Janani.

961
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,240
It's been eight years
since her father passed away.

962
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:41,160
But last night, we got a message
from your bank that

963
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,760
Seventy lakh rupees were transferred

964
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:45,280
from her dad's account to another account.

965
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,440
We've never got such messages
from the bank before.

966
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:49,640
In fact, my dad...

967
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,200
They weren't aware that
her father had this bank account.

968
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:55,240
They had kept his phone active
for sentimental reasons.

969
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,000
But it was the first time
they received such a message.

970
00:46:58,120 --> 00:46:59,160
It's strange.

971
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,200
Ten transactions in an hour.

972
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:02,920
Seven lakhs each, totalling to 70 lakhs.

973
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,440
Yes, madam. We got scared and came here.

974
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,240
Give me a detailed complaint.
I'll forward it.

975
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,320
Okay, ma'am.

976
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:11,840
I forwarded their complaint to the manager
on the same day.

977
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:13,800
And when I checked the system
with the complaint copy,

978
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:17,160
I noticed that the funds were sent
using your passkey.

979
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:18,880
That family never came back.

980
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,720
Was anybody here with similar complaints?

981
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,440
-Not to my knowledge.
-No?

982
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,640
[Bus honking]

983
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,280
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

984
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:06,480
Jerry, my dear!

985
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:08,760
What do you want now?

986
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,240
It was a small slip from my end.

987
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:11,960
Please forgive me.

988
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,480
A small slip?

989
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,640
If you want me to talk to you ever again,

990
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,640
talk to Indu and find a compromise.

991
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:18,680
Else, you may leave!

992
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,200
But I can't go back now!

993
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,560
The cops are looking for me!

994
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,160
You're the reason for all that, right?

995
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,600
Where do I go now?

996
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,000
You may live here then.

997
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,400
But don't you ever talk to me!

998
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:33,120
-Let's go?
-Okay.

999
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,200
Really?!

1000
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:39,280
If he ditched that girl
and is with this girl now,

1001
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,040
why should I bother
mediating for a compromise?

1002
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,160
Awesome!

1003
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:47,680
I can't discuss this at the bank.

1004
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:49,160
That's why I asked you to meet outside.

1005
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:53,360
It's not a technical glitch
or a random incident, as we thought.

1006
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:55,080
Within the last year,

1007
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:57,240
Around 10 crores of rupees were transferred

1008
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:58,800
using my passkey alone,

1009
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,920
to dead or inactive accounts.

1010
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,880
I checked the whole system. Have a look.

1011
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:07,560
Money's been sent to various accounts

1012
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,000
from these dormant bank accounts.

1013
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,200
Jerry...

1014
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:13,920
I don't understand.

1015
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,400
Sithu...

1016
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,680
For instance, in your home-town,

1017
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,920
just in the Thiruvalla area,

1018
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,400
roughly 6,000 crores of rupees

1019
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,400
are stranded in such dormant accounts.

1020
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:27,600
Then,

1021
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:31,000
imagine how huge it would be
at a big city like Chennai?

1022
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,640
What if a person or a syndicate

1023
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,600
starts targetting such accounts?

1024
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:38,880
Accounts like Venkatesh's father's,

1025
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:40,720
what if somebody hacks them?

1026
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:43,080
What if there's an insider who can

1027
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:48,120
fetch them the details of
inactive accounts with money?

1028
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:50,320
Somebody who can influence

1029
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,520
the internal systems of our bank?

1030
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,080
The bond between our parties
'TA MA KA' and 'MU TA KA'

1031
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,400
isn't just a recent thing,

1032
00:49:58,440 --> 00:49:59,840
it's been a fifty-year partnership.

1033
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:02,400
The public has elected us
only because of that trust.

1034
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,040
Go tell your boss

1035
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:06,280
that until I take my last breath,

1036
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:10,200
not even one person from these 24 MLAs
will ever join him.

1037
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:13,560
Master...  Please don't be impulsive

1038
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:17,240
and think about the benefits
if you accept the offer.

1039
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,720
Thangasamy...
Don't you poke your nose in this.

1040
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,520
It's our party, the 'Murpokk Tamilar Kachi'

1041
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,480
who gave you
the finance minister's position.

1042
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:26,600
He must have offered you the CM position
if you betray our party.

1043
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:29,040
You can be the chief minister
only after becoming an MLA, right?

1044
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,480
Don't get lost in dreams.

1045
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:31,520
Master...

1046
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,320
Don't take a decision immediately.

1047
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:36,800
Vetri sir will meet you in person.

1048
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,680
Please take whatever decision you want,
after that.

1049
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:41,160
His Highness Vetrivel sir!

1050
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:46,120
Tell him this house won't open
even with his golden keys!

1056
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:21,200
I've bought all your 24 MLAs.

1057
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:24,600
I could take over this entire party
before you even see it coming!

1058
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:27,440
But I've got my own way of doing things.

1059
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:34,680
I, Vetrivel Shanmuga Sundaram,

1060
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:36,960
all I want is 'Vetri', that is victory.

1061
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:40,640
Whoever stands in my way
will meet their end.

We used to stay

I was seven or eight years old then.

Our house is on the slope of a mountain.

1273
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:54,160
It was Christmas.

1274
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:56,560
My mom and I were inside

1275

while Dad and my younger sister
sat on the veranda outside.

1276

After a while, what we see is

1277
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:03,680
a whole mountain coming towards our house.

1278
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:05,920
I mean, it collapsed onto our house
like this...

1279
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:08,320
It slid down
with all the mud and water below.

1280

As I tried to climb,
my legs kept sinking deeper into the mud

1284

As I searched with my hands,
suddenly, I saw my mother's hand.

1285

I immediately grabbed onto it.

1286
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,320
She slowly lifted me out of the mud.

1287
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:27,240
She stood there like that until morning.

1288
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:29,920

the villagers came, cleared the mud,
and rescued both of us.

My mom was unconscious.

They sprinkled water
and brought her back to consciousness.

1295
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:49,040
my father and sister left us.

1296

After that, for many days,

1297
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:55,920
I could only sleep
with my mother's hand on my chest.

1298
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:59,840
Then she took me to the priest
and later to a counsellor.

1299

They said I was suffering from
something like...  'drama release... '

Why sorry?

1582
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:10,680
You go home.

1583
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:13,480
Well, let me meet Jose and then come there.

1584
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:14,560
Okay.

1585
01:25:23,480 --> 01:25:24,600
Hello?

1586
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:25,760
Hey, stop! Stop!

1587
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:27,600
Stop! I said stop!

1588
01:25:27,640 --> 01:25:28,640
Stop!

1589
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:29,800
I said stop! Hey!

1590
01:25:29,960 --> 01:25:31,560
-Get down, everyone.
-Get down.

1591
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:33,520
All of you, out!

1592
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:36,120
-Quick! Go, go, go!
-[Indistinct screams]

1593
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:38,480
Make it quick.

1594
01:25:39,240 --> 01:25:40,360
Hey!

1595
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:42,320
Tell him to start the bus.

1596
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:44,600
Start the bus now. Go, go!

1597
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:57,600
Sit there, you!

1598
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:08,040
[Thud on railing]

1599
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:25,320
Hey! Is this how you stop the vehicle?

1600
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:27,720
-Why did you pull over?!
-Kick him out and you drive.

1601
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:31,560
[Suspenseful music]

1602
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:32,960
[Engine revs]

1603
01:26:34,120 --> 01:26:35,480
[Leaves rustling]

1604
01:26:49,480 --> 01:26:50,680
[Glass shatters]

1605
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:16,320
[Click of gun]

1606
01:27:57,520 --> 01:27:58,840
[Ratchet sound]

1607
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:06,840
This is some big issue.

1608
01:28:07,640 --> 01:28:09,480
It wasn't just a facade to scare you,

1609
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:12,320
but a pre-planned, solid attempt
to murder you.

1610
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:13,920
First, there was Jerry's incident

1611
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:16,040
then you lost your job
without any prior notice,

1612
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:18,360
and now some strangers are
up to murder you.

1613
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:20,200
I don't understand a damn thing!

1614
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:23,120
Just tell me what monkey business
you all have gotten involved in.

1615
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:24,880
I don't understand any of this, Jose.

1616
01:28:24,920 --> 01:28:26,040
[Doorbell buzzes]

1617
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:30,440
[Buzzing continues]

1618
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:32,000
Stay there.

1619
01:28:38,120 --> 01:28:39,520
Sithara?

1620
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:42,560
Jose, this is Sithara.

1621
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:44,040
I know, I have seen her.

1622
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:45,840
You guys talk. I will wait outside.

1623
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:48,880
C...  come inside.

1624
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:52,920
Please come.

1625
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:54,120
I don't have much time.

1626
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:57,640
I'm catching tonight's flight to Dubai
to my sister's place.

1627
01:28:57,720 --> 01:28:59,960
Before I leave,
I have to tell you all there.

1628
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,080
Otherwise, I wouldn't have peace
in this life.

1629
01:29:02,120 --> 01:29:04,120
What's the matter, Sithara?

1630
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:08,640
I've been awake for two days straight
because of fear.

1631
01:29:08,720 --> 01:29:11,000
I'm sure they're chasing me.

1632
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:13,240
Who?

1633
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:14,880
The gang who killed Jerry.

1634
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:15,920
What?

1635
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:22,600
What are you saying, Sithara?

1636
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:25,080
A few days ago,

1637
01:29:25,480 --> 01:29:28,400
two complainants came to our bank.

1638
01:29:29,720 --> 01:29:34,120
That was a massive scam committed
using Jerry's passkey.

1639
01:29:34,760 --> 01:29:36,800
It deeply upset him initially.

1640
01:29:36,920 --> 01:29:40,520
Jerry was determined to track down
the culprits behind this.

1641
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:42,640
Finally, we figured out

1642
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:45,160
who the mastermind behind this is.

1643
01:29:45,640 --> 01:29:47,680
Vetrivel Shanmuga Sundaram?

1644
01:29:47,720 --> 01:29:48,720
Yes.

1645
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:51,160
His main account is in our branch.

1646
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:54,320
Jerry knew that
if Vetrivel's syndicate broke,

1647
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:56,240
your bank would be in trouble.

1648
01:29:56,440 --> 01:29:59,800
Jerry came to see you that day
to inform you about this.

1649
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:01,960
But...

1650
01:30:04,680 --> 01:30:06,520
Indu, please, listen to me once.

1651
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:17,680
I warned him numerous times
not to intervene

1652
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:18,960
and to let things be.

1653
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:20,200
But he didn't listen to me.

1654
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:23,240
He called me after leaving your bank too.

1655
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:25,960
But she's not picking up my call.

1656
01:30:26,240 --> 01:30:27,920
If possible, you try calling her once.

1657
01:30:28,040 --> 01:30:29,600
And forward her the files.

1658
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:31,880
How can I call her?

1659
01:30:31,880 --> 01:30:33,240
Hold on a second, Sithu.

1660
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:36,040
Ammachi, did Jose chettayi come?

1661
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:37,400
Not yet, Jerry.

1662
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:38,920
The house key is below the doormat.

1663
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:40,920
You take it, son.
I'll come after some time.

1664
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:42,920
Let me shed a bit of calorie.

1665
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:44,280
Okay.

1666
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:46,040
Tell me, Sithu.

1667
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:47,920
I am not friends with Indu, Jerry.

1668
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:49,880
I have met her only once.

1669
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:52,160
Yet, I will try calling her.

1670
01:30:52,440 --> 01:30:54,160
Are you sure you are okay?

1671
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:56,640
Yeah. One minute.

1672
01:30:58,480 --> 01:30:59,920
Switch it to video call.

1673
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:06,840
See, I am all fine.

1674
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:08,320
Don't stress yourself out.

1675
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:09,840
I have reached Jose chettayi's flat.

1676
01:31:09,960 --> 01:31:11,880
Now, nobody will lay a finger on me.

1677
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:14,600
Jose chettayi will take care of everything.
[Doorbell rings]

1678
01:31:14,640 --> 01:31:16,720
Sithu, I think he is here.

1679
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:21,000
[Door opens]

1680
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:30,600
[Running and struggling]

1681
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:44,960
Argh!

1682
01:31:53,640 --> 01:31:54,640
[Panting]

1683
01:32:01,160 --> 01:32:02,840
[Suffocates, struggling to breathe]

01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:06,480
[Sithara sobs]

01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:30,520
[Sithara pants]

1686
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:39,600
[Sithara whimpering]

1687
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:42,720
[Sombre music]

1688
01:32:58,640 --> 01:33:02,720
Jerry believed
that Jose chettayi could save him.

1689
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:06,000
But...

1690
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:09,880
Jose chettayi...

1691
01:33:11,280 --> 01:33:13,280
-Hey...  Sorry...  please...
-No!

1692
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:24,800
This is the evidence that Jerry found.

1693
01:33:25,480 --> 01:33:27,920
I'm not sure
if this is even useful anymore.

1694
01:33:28,120 --> 01:33:31,520
But he told me to give it to you, Indu.

1695
01:33:35,320 --> 01:33:36,360
Let me go.

1696
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:38,040
Or I'll miss my flight.

1697
01:33:38,040 --> 01:33:39,400
That's my friend with me.

1698
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:41,000
He'll drop me off at the airport.

1699
01:33:41,720 --> 01:33:42,720
Okay.

1700
01:33:51,240 --> 01:33:53,040
Sir, sir, one minute, please.

1701
01:33:53,320 --> 01:33:54,560
What's the matter?

1702
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:57,480
I thought I would meet the CM
regarding the road to my apartment.

1703
01:33:57,520 --> 01:33:59,720
Our state is in turmoil now
and CM is burning in anger.

1704
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:01,520
and yet you're here with this petty issue?

1705
01:34:03,480 --> 01:34:04,720
What happened, Moorthy?

1706
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:07,160
Three hours ago,
two more people joined the other side.

1707
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:09,720
See, thirty has become thirty-two now.

1708
01:34:12,120 --> 01:34:14,960
Did you figure out where they hid the MLAs?

1709
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:16,120
We traced the location, CM.

1710
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:19,600
But every time we reach there,
they keep changing the location.

1711
01:34:19,680 --> 01:34:23,080
They've kept their phones off
to avoid being traced.

1712
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:24,840
How do they know this?

1713
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:27,880
Sir, I think, there's someone
leaking information from our side.

1714
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:32,920
Find that person immediately.

1715
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:33,960
Sir.

1716
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,160
What happened?

1717
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:44,920
The CM knows everything.

1718
01:34:45,200 --> 01:34:46,840
He just couldn't find it yet

1719
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:48,440
as it is your personal resort.

1720
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:50,640
But if we don't get hold
of the party by tomorrow,

1721
01:34:50,680 --> 01:34:52,040
everything will be ruined.

1722
01:34:52,080 --> 01:34:53,080
Leave it.

1723
01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:54,840
There's a much graver issue here.

1724
01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:57,400
These losers will visit the governor

1725
01:34:57,440 --> 01:35:00,000
only if we pay them
the whole sum by 10 AM tomorrow.

1726
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,160
That's their latest demand!

1727
01:35:01,160 --> 01:35:02,360
What will we do now?

1728
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:03,400
Don't worry.

1729
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:07,200
The hard cash we need
is stored in a couple of banks.

1730
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:08,920
I have made arrangements to bring it.

1731
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:13,000
Just come to collect the money
when I give you a call.

1732
01:35:21,240 --> 01:35:24,640
Sister, Sithara is the sole witness
to Jerry's murder.

1733
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:27,440
She said she's not interested
in going behind this case.

1734
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:29,760
So, what's the point
in reporting this to the police?

1735
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:32,800
What do you mean,
should we hush up such a big crime?

1736
01:35:33,240 --> 01:35:34,280
Andrew sir is calling.

1737
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:36,320
I told him you lost your job.

1738
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:38,480
He said he'll check into it
and give us a call.

1739
01:35:40,240 --> 01:35:41,280
Andrew sir...

1740
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:43,840
Jose, Indu's job termination

1741
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:45,680
is part of a larger scheme.

1742
01:35:47,360 --> 01:35:50,760
Have you heard of
Vetrivel Shanmuga Sundaram?

1743
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:52,440
Yeah, I saw just now.

1744
01:35:52,640 --> 01:35:55,600
Vetrivel is an unknown kingmaker
of Chennai.

1745
01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:58,160
He usually doesn't come into the limelight.

1746
01:35:58,160 --> 01:36:00,560
But his syndicate...  what can I say...

1747
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:04,560
there's this widespread...
blanket of fear surrounding it.

1748
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:07,840
Killing is just a sport for him, man.

1749
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:11,000
Indu madam lost her job as per his demand.

1750
01:36:11,080 --> 01:36:13,680
Jose, tell Indu to get out of Chennai.

1751
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:15,520
You also, move from here.

1752
01:36:15,560 --> 01:36:17,480
If Vetrivel is behind this,

1753
01:36:17,680 --> 01:36:20,200
not a single soul will be left alive.

1754
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:22,400
Never come back to this city.

1755
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:25,080
If you need money, just let me know.
I'll transfer it.

1756
01:36:25,120 --> 01:36:26,120
Okay, sir.

1757
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:28,080
Hurry up, pack your things.

1758
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:30,600
I'll bring my mother and come here.
Let's quickly leave for our hometown.

1759
01:36:30,640 --> 01:36:32,360
Why?! Why should we run away?

1760
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:33,920
Or else? Gonna file a police case?

1761
01:36:33,960 --> 01:36:35,000
What are you even saying?

1762
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:36,680

This isn't a fantasy world.

1764

I know someone who's an honest cop.

1765
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:42,800
All we need is to get a case registered.

1766
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:44,160
If not, we'll go to the media.

1767
01:36:44,160 --> 01:36:46,680
This isn't a casual street brawl
at a church fair

1768
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:48,280
that I can tackle easily.

1769
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:49,560
This could be fatal.

1770
01:36:49,560 --> 01:36:52,600
Not a dog will stand up for us
if they find all of us dead on the street.

1771
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:53,440
So, hurry up.

1772
01:36:53,480 --> 01:36:55,000
Wait Jose, let me try.

1773
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:02,280
Hello, Sukumar sir?

1774
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:17,640
-Hello sir.
-Hello, Indu madam.

1775
01:37:17,720 --> 01:37:19,000
I was out when you called.

1776
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:21,880
-I'm not late, right?
-That's okay. We just reached here.

1777
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:25,280
From what you said on the phone,
this sounds serious.

1778
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:27,240
That's why I wanted to meet you in person.

1779
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:30,800
Vetrivel has spies both inside and outside
the police department.

1780
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:34,400
We must lock him up before this news leaks.

1781
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:36,040
-Okay, thank you, sir.
-Sir.

1782
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:37,920
-This is CI Sakthivel.
-Hello.

1783
01:37:38,040 --> 01:37:39,240
No, no. You can trust him.

Explain everything in detail to her.

1785
01:37:41,400 --> 01:37:43,280
I'll return
before you start recording the FIR.

1786
01:37:43,320 --> 01:37:44,840
I have a conference call
with the police commissioner.

1787
01:37:44,840 --> 01:37:45,880
Just ten minutes.

1788
01:37:50,720 --> 01:37:52,960
Give this copy to the inspector.

1789
01:37:55,560 --> 01:37:58,200
So, after Sithara's statement,
you started suspecting

1790
01:37:58,320 --> 01:38:01,640
Jerry's death was a murder, didn't you?

1791
01:38:01,880 --> 01:38:03,840
Not suspicion, sir. I'm sure of it.

1792
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,320
We suspect a major scam.

1793
01:38:06,760 --> 01:38:08,160
Before Jerry's death,

1794
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:10,440
a man named Venkatesh and his family

1795
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:12,200
were killed in connection to this.

1796
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:14,280
Vetrivel Sundaram.

1797
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:16,440
He's the one behind all this.

1798
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:19,280
Jerry had collected
all the necessary evidence against him.

1799
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:29,480
It was 'Auto Billa'
who committed the murder..

1800
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:31,600
No sir. He was framed.

1801
01:38:31,720 --> 01:38:34,160
Jose talked to this guy, Auto Billa
in person.

1802
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:41,520
At the time of Jerry's death,
Billa went to the flat searching for Jose.

1803
01:38:42,040 --> 01:38:45,800
On his way back,
he spotted Vetrivel's henchmen there.

1806
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:55,920
I've recorded the complaint you gave.

1807
01:38:56,200 --> 01:38:58,160
and checked out
the evidence you gave me as well.

1808
01:38:58,600 --> 01:38:59,840
But...

1809
01:39:00,440 --> 01:39:01,840
for my clarity,

1810
01:39:02,480 --> 01:39:04,440
can I ask you a couple of questions?

1811
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:08,320
You and this guy, Jerry who passed away...

1812
01:39:09,120 --> 01:39:10,840
what was your relationship with him?

1813
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:12,520
He was my boyfriend, sir.

1814
01:39:12,600 --> 01:39:13,600
Boyfriend?

1815
01:39:14,680 --> 01:39:16,360
The who's this guy? New boyfriend?!

1816
01:39:16,600 --> 01:39:17,600
What?

1817
01:39:20,280 --> 01:39:21,280
No.

Madam...

1819
01:39:23,560 --> 01:39:26,240
Your boyfriend just passed away
barely two days ago,

1820
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:28,560
and you're already with someone new?!

1821
01:39:30,920 --> 01:39:33,680
Jerry hanged himself in his house.

1822
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:36,320
I can very well assume that
you and your new boyfriend

1823
01:39:36,360 --> 01:39:37,920
made a foolproof plan

1824
01:39:37,960 --> 01:39:40,800
and murdered your old boyfriend, right?

1825
01:39:40,840 --> 01:39:42,400

-Yes, sir.

But you're not clever.

1840
01:41:15,320 --> 01:41:19,120
You should've escaped
at the first opportunity.

1841
01:41:20,840 --> 01:41:22,760
And see, you've fished all these troubles

1842

01:49:05,200 --> 01:49:07,000
Iron man...  That's a movie character.

1932
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,560
Oh, Ammachi! I've told you a million times

1933
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:12,080
to stop watching this damn cartoon!

1934
01:49:12,200 --> 01:49:14,720
Get lost, you fool!
This isn't a cartoon, it's comics!"

1935
01:49:14,720 --> 01:49:16,200
Whatever damn it is!

1936
01:49:16,240 --> 01:49:18,640
Ammachi, please listen carefully
to what I'm about to say.

1937
01:49:18,840 --> 01:49:19,840
Will you?

1938
01:50:15,080 --> 01:50:16,480
[Suspenseful music]

1939
01:50:31,440 --> 01:50:32,520
Shit!

1940
01:50:32,600 --> 01:50:34,360
[Explosion]

1941
01:50:35,960 --> 01:50:38,600
[Goons fall from impact]

1942
01:50:41,440 --> 01:50:43,360
[Emergency siren wailing]

1943
01:50:43,400 --> 01:50:46,280
[Crowd chattering in emergency and despair]

1944
01:50:56,840 --> 01:50:58,160
Run! Run!

1945
01:50:58,680 --> 01:51:00,080
Run fast!

1946
01:51:01,800 --> 01:51:03,000
Classic!

1947
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:08,040
[Tyres screeching]

1948
01:51:10,440 --> 01:51:12,000
Hey, stop.

1949
01:51:17,280 --> 01:51:18,480
[Door opens]

1950
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:31,400
Why are you here?

1951
01:51:32,360 --> 01:51:34,600
Billa bro, why are you in this house?

1952
01:51:34,840 --> 01:51:36,000
This is my house.

1953
01:51:36,160 --> 01:51:38,280
Me and my gang are boozing here.

1954
01:51:38,400 --> 01:51:39,440
What brand do you want?

1955
01:51:39,640 --> 01:51:40,640
No, bro...

1956
01:51:40,680 --> 01:51:43,360
we were told there's a girl here...

1957
01:51:43,560 --> 01:51:44,720
That's why we came here.

1958
01:51:45,080 --> 01:51:47,040
Not one, but two girls were here.

1959
01:51:47,080 --> 01:51:48,520
They needed money,

1960
01:51:48,560 --> 01:51:50,840
so they rented out this place to me
for a small sum.

1961
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:51,880
With furniture.

1962
01:51:52,440 --> 01:51:56,400
I also decided
to move to this decent setup.

1963
01:51:57,240 --> 01:51:58,520
Nice deal, right?

1964
01:51:58,680 --> 01:52:00,120
Super deal, bro!

1965
01:52:00,400 --> 01:52:01,440
I know.

1966
01:52:01,440 --> 01:52:02,800
It's a slight misunderstanding.

1967
01:52:02,920 --> 01:52:04,520
Sorry, brother. Sorry, brother.

1968
01:52:04,560 --> 01:52:06,160
Please carry on.
Hey, all of you, come.

1969
01:52:06,200 --> 01:52:07,400
-See you, bro.
-Go, man!

1970
01:52:07,440 --> 01:52:08,440
Come.

1971
01:52:10,160 --> 01:52:11,800
Sister, come out.

1972
01:52:12,200 --> 01:52:13,680
We need to leave immediately.

1973
01:52:13,680 --> 01:52:15,800
They'll certainly come back.

1974
01:52:15,960 --> 01:52:18,160
Just tell them I've gone out.

1975
01:52:18,560 --> 01:52:19,680
Come, dear. Let's go.

1976
01:52:19,880 --> 01:52:21,160
Come.

1977
01:52:26,480 --> 01:52:28,600
Did you search the whole house?

1978
01:52:28,640 --> 01:52:31,840
Nobody can unnecessarily
barge into Auto Billa's house, sir.

1979
01:52:32,120 --> 01:52:35,360
Even if we try,
we'll end up in big trouble.

1980
01:52:42,080 --> 01:52:43,800
Where's that Auto Billa now?

1981
01:52:57,400 --> 01:52:59,000
-Sister..
-Are you alright? - Yeah.

1982
01:52:59,040 --> 01:53:00,360
The police are all over the road.

1983
01:53:00,360 --> 01:53:02,760
I have no clue how to get out of here
and make it back to my hometown.

1984
01:53:02,800 --> 01:53:03,960
Don't worry.

1985
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:07,560
A car shipment
from a familiar factory outside the city

1986
01:53:07,600 --> 01:53:09,760
is heading to Kerala via Salem.

1987
01:53:09,960 --> 01:53:11,760
I will send you there.

1988
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:12,720
Okay.

1989
01:53:12,760 --> 01:53:13,760
What about my car?

1990
01:53:13,920 --> 01:53:15,720
They know its number all the damn details.

1991
01:53:15,840 --> 01:53:17,280
Leave your car to me.

1992
01:53:17,400 --> 01:53:18,800
You can take my car.

1993
01:53:18,960 --> 01:53:20,360
I'll send you the location and address.

1994
01:53:20,400 --> 01:53:21,960
Don't waste time. Come, get in.

1995
01:53:31,440 --> 01:53:33,280
[Police siren wailing]

1996
01:53:36,440 --> 01:53:37,640
[Phone rings]

1997
01:53:43,760 --> 01:53:45,720
Vetrivel Shanmugha Sundaram here.

1998
01:53:48,560 --> 01:53:49,800
You are smart!

1999
01:53:49,960 --> 01:53:51,880
I underestimated you a bit.

2000
01:53:52,120 --> 01:53:54,880
But you've bloody impressed me! Wow!

2001
01:53:55,200 --> 01:53:56,760
You won this round as well.

2002
01:53:57,080 --> 01:53:58,560
Good Job.

2003
01:53:58,960 --> 01:54:00,520
I'll offer you a reward.

2004
01:54:00,720 --> 01:54:02,080
This is a one-time offer.

2005
01:54:02,760 --> 01:54:05,760
I know that your mom means a lot to you.

2006
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,520
You may go home with your mom,

2007
01:54:08,680 --> 01:54:10,800
and you can take
that younger girl along too.

2008
01:54:11,440 --> 01:54:14,480
But Indulekha...  I want her.

2009
01:54:15,840 --> 01:54:17,200
She's so adamant,

2010
01:54:17,200 --> 01:54:20,040
and you know,
she's not the 'giving up' type!

2011
01:54:20,360 --> 01:54:22,400
So, hand her over to me,

2012
01:54:22,960 --> 01:54:25,000
and you can go wherever you want.

2013
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:27,440
I don't care.

2014
01:54:30,560 --> 01:54:32,400
We care, you bitch!

2015
01:54:43,160 --> 01:54:46,000
Hey! You don't know what I'm capable of!

2016
01:54:46,040 --> 01:54:49,800
My henchmen will chop all your heads off!

2017
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:02,000
Vetri sir...

2018
01:55:03,680 --> 01:55:06,160
What were you saying?
What will happen to me if I kill you?

2019
01:55:06,280 --> 01:55:07,720
If you kill me...

2020
01:55:07,960 --> 01:55:11,080
not even a dog will bark for me, sir.

2021
01:55:14,120 --> 01:55:15,240
Where's Jose?

2022
01:55:15,280 --> 01:55:16,440
Sir!

2023
01:55:16,640 --> 01:55:18,360
He's my buddy.

2024
01:55:18,520 --> 01:55:21,320
This Billa, that's me,
will never betray a friend!

2025
01:55:22,360 --> 01:55:24,280
Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir!

2026
01:55:24,600 --> 01:55:27,880
He's not my buddy or anything!

2027
01:55:27,880 --> 01:55:30,080
I will tell you everything in detail.

2028
01:55:30,280 --> 01:55:32,040
Vincent, take him with you.

2029
01:55:32,320 --> 01:55:33,600
It's not a game.

2030
01:55:33,640 --> 01:55:35,080
I want all of them

2031
01:55:35,160 --> 01:55:37,120
Not tomorrow, not in two hours.

2032
01:55:37,120 --> 01:55:38,880
I want them now!

2033
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:40,320
Want them now!

2034
01:55:40,400 --> 01:55:41,720
Want them now!

2035
01:55:42,080 --> 01:55:43,240
Now! Now! Now!

2036
01:55:44,080 --> 01:55:45,320
[Music begins]

2037
01:56:30,920 --> 01:56:33,200
[Muffled chattering]

2038
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:41,880
How did you trip and get such bad wounds?

2039
01:56:42,200 --> 01:56:43,360
I fell out of nowhere.

2040
01:56:43,400 --> 01:56:45,160
How could I predict where I'd get a wound?

2041
01:56:45,440 --> 01:56:47,040
After falling on one side of your face,

2042
01:56:47,040 --> 01:56:48,960
did you also fall on the other side?!

2043
01:56:49,240 --> 01:56:50,600
You have bruises on both sides.

2044
01:56:50,640 --> 01:56:53,160
Yeah! I was mad that I fell,
so I intentionally fell again!

2045
01:56:53,280 --> 01:56:54,280
Sit calmly.

2046
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:16,080
This is the place, sir.

2047
01:57:25,720 --> 01:57:27,160
-He's coming, sir.
-Let him.

2048
01:57:50,440 --> 01:57:51,560
[Fearful whimpering]

2049
01:57:52,600 --> 01:57:54,080
Please, sir, don't fire the gun!

2050
01:57:54,120 --> 01:57:56,600
Jose, claiming to be your aide,
gave us money and this vehicle

2051
01:57:56,640 --> 01:57:57,960
and instructed us to come here.

2052
01:57:58,000 --> 01:57:59,040
Where's he?

2053
01:57:59,040 --> 01:58:00,480
He said he was leaving for Dubai.

2054
01:58:00,520 --> 01:58:02,120
We don't know anything else.

2055
01:58:02,920 --> 01:58:04,640
Please don't hit me, sir.

2056
01:58:04,920 --> 01:58:07,120
Before I conned him,

2057
01:58:07,160 --> 01:58:09,200
he had already stabbed me in the back, sir!

2058
01:58:09,400 --> 01:58:10,400
Bloody scum!

2059
01:58:10,400 --> 01:58:12,880
THEN WHERE THE HELL ARE THEY?

2060
01:58:16,680 --> 01:58:19,200
Oh, no! Please don't be scared, sister.

2061
01:58:19,240 --> 01:58:20,840
I'm not here to cause any trouble.

2062
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:22,480
Our stunts are already over.

2063
01:58:22,480 --> 01:58:24,120
See, he left the gun here so carelessly.

2064
01:58:24,160 --> 01:58:25,520
How are you feeling now, sir?

2065
01:58:25,800 --> 01:58:28,120
Does it hurt?
Have you applied any medicine?

2066
01:58:28,480 --> 01:58:29,880
Where is he? Let me meet him once.

2067
01:58:29,880 --> 01:58:30,920
Ah!

2068
01:58:31,480 --> 01:58:32,840
Here you are!

2069
01:58:33,160 --> 01:58:34,160
Sir...

2070
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:35,600
Did you have tea?

2071
01:58:36,160 --> 01:58:38,240
Sister, to be honest...

2072
01:58:38,800 --> 01:58:41,160
his behaviour is a little questionable.

2073
01:58:41,640 --> 01:58:44,840
Sir got us into a pickle
and now we're scrambling to save ourselves.

2074
01:58:45,080 --> 01:58:46,960
Jose, you don't realise
the consequences of this!

2075
01:58:46,960 --> 01:58:49,520
I stopped caring about the consequences
a long time ago!

2076
01:58:49,560 --> 01:58:50,880
So, forget it.

2077
01:58:51,840 --> 01:58:53,600
Your daughter is Shivani, right?

2078
01:58:54,040 --> 01:58:55,800
Hey, don't be scared!

2079
01:58:55,800 --> 01:58:58,640
Saw her downstairs,
returning from a birthday party.

2080
01:58:58,880 --> 01:59:01,320
Quite coincidental!
Just exchanged pleasantries, that's all!

2081
01:59:01,360 --> 01:59:02,400
No, Jose!

2082
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:04,080
It's not a big deal, sir!

2083
01:59:04,400 --> 01:59:06,800
We're all going on a trip together.

2084
01:59:07,160 --> 01:59:08,360
You'll drive the car, sir.

2085
01:59:08,400 --> 01:59:11,160
Because if I drive,
the cops you've lined up all along the way

2086
01:59:11,560 --> 01:59:14,880
won't let us reach the destination on time.

2087
01:59:14,920 --> 01:59:17,360
Jose, a kidnapping case
will also be filed against you.

2088
01:59:17,400 --> 01:59:18,560
There he goes!

2089
01:59:18,800 --> 01:59:20,760
He's already framed me
with a fake murder case.

2090
01:59:20,800 --> 01:59:22,520
Now, the police station attack case
as well.

2091
01:59:22,560 --> 01:59:25,360
Adding an extra kidnapping charge
won't make much difference!

2092
01:59:25,720 --> 01:59:28,560
Like a drop in the ocean!

2093
01:59:31,080 --> 01:59:32,480
Walk forward, sir!

2094
01:59:43,120 --> 01:59:44,120
Sir...

2095
01:59:44,440 --> 01:59:46,440
Don't try pulling off any tricks!

2096
01:59:46,560 --> 01:59:49,520
The bullets will go through
the little girl, Shivani's chest!

2097
01:59:49,560 --> 01:59:51,040
Will see everything else later.

2098
01:59:54,920 --> 01:59:56,160
He's just bragging, my child.

2099
01:59:56,200 --> 01:59:57,440
He won't even touch you.

2100
01:59:57,480 --> 01:59:58,800
He's harmless.

2101
01:59:58,880 --> 02:00:02,400
Just one glare from me
and he'll wet his pants!

2102
02:00:02,680 --> 02:00:03,680
Darn!

2103
02:00:03,680 --> 02:00:04,720
Ammachi!

2104
02:00:04,720 --> 02:00:05,880
That's the truth, isn't it?

2105
02:00:06,800 --> 02:00:08,400
Ammachi is just impossible!

2106
02:00:23,920 --> 02:00:24,960
Sir.

Man, DCP sir has no mother or sister.

02:14:28,840 --> 02:14:30,040
and you'll be the star!

2286
02:14:30,120 --> 02:14:31,280
Not just an ordinary star,

2287
02:14:31,280 --> 02:14:32,480
but a superstar!

2288
02:14:32,720 --> 02:14:33,760
Okay.

2289
02:14:48,200 --> 02:14:49,200
And Jose...

2290
02:14:51,160 --> 02:14:53,880
He doesn't start...

2291
02:14:53,880 --> 02:14:55,640
anything he can't finish, sir!

2292
02:14:55,840 --> 02:14:57,040
[Car crashing]

2293
02:15:16,720 --> 02:15:18,080
Release the girl, you!

2294
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:20,200
[Indu screams]

2295
02:15:46,200 --> 02:15:47,320
Jose!

2296
02:15:52,680 --> 02:15:53,760
Jose!

2297
02:16:00,400 --> 02:16:01,560
Wow!

2298
02:16:13,080 --> 02:16:14,600
So you've decided

2299
02:16:14,880 --> 02:16:17,920
this girl is more important to you
than your mother!

2300
02:16:18,560 --> 02:16:20,360
Are you that cheap, Jose?

2301
02:16:20,880 --> 02:16:23,480
Don't underestimate Jose like that, sir!

2302
02:16:24,360 --> 02:16:27,880
You still don't get it, sir.
I'm not like those other local fighters.

2303
02:16:28,560 --> 02:16:31,680
I don't go around pounding on people
and making enemies.

2304
02:16:32,200 --> 02:16:35,760
Everyone I've had a brawl with
ends up being my buddy.

2305
02:16:38,360 --> 02:16:41,720
And Andrew sir called you
just like I told him to.

2306
02:16:41,960 --> 02:16:44,320
So that you could send
some of your goons there.

2307
02:16:54,320 --> 02:16:55,560
That's brilliant!

2308
02:16:55,600 --> 02:16:57,280
A variety move indeed!

2309
02:16:57,440 --> 02:16:58,440
Sir...

2310
02:16:58,760 --> 02:17:00,640
everyone is not
that business or money-minded!

2311
02:17:00,880 --> 02:17:03,080
So, what's next?

2312
02:17:03,480 --> 02:17:05,200
Nothing much, sir.

2313
02:17:05,400 --> 02:17:08,640
I am not that hardcore
to chop down hundreds of folks at once.

2314
02:17:08,680 --> 02:17:10,800
I might not make it
out of this place alive.

2315
02:17:11,720 --> 02:17:14,120
But if I fall here,

2316
02:17:14,920 --> 02:17:17,600
at least ten or fifteen people
will go down with me.

2317
02:17:18,360 --> 02:17:19,680
And one of them...

2318
02:17:20,560 --> 02:17:21,840
is gonna be you!

2319
02:17:28,400 --> 02:17:29,600
Move aside, dear.

2320
02:17:29,640 --> 02:17:31,040
No settlement is possible in this.

2321
02:17:31,040 --> 02:17:32,880
Let it just happen as it goes!

2322
02:18:09,560 --> 02:18:10,720
Jose!

2323
02:18:19,280 --> 02:18:20,480
[Stabbing]

2324
02:18:41,960 --> 02:18:43,320
[Gunshots]

2325
02:20:14,200 --> 02:20:15,440
[Indu screams]

2326
02:20:33,320 --> 02:20:34,960
Did they all drop from the sky?

2327
02:20:35,160 --> 02:20:36,760
Is there no end to this?

2328
02:20:46,320 --> 02:20:47,600
[Swords clashing]

2329
02:21:29,920 --> 02:21:31,200
[Music begins]

2330
02:22:56,680 --> 02:22:58,120
[Engine revs]

2331
02:23:58,280 --> 02:24:02,720
I believe everyone deserves
a second shot at life

2332
02:24:04,400 --> 02:24:05,880
But Vetrivel...

2333
02:24:05,920 --> 02:24:07,560
I can't offer you that.

2334
02:24:08,840 --> 02:24:10,880
You've run out of chances!

2335
02:25:11,880 --> 02:25:15,400
Jose, what you're saying is scary.

2336
02:25:15,560 --> 02:25:17,800
Could similar things happen
in our state's banks as well?

2337
02:25:17,840 --> 02:25:19,200
The rules have changed now.

2338
02:25:19,200 --> 02:25:20,400
[Power supply shutting down]

2339
02:25:20,440 --> 02:25:21,800
The power supply is gone?

2340
02:25:21,920 --> 02:25:22,960
[Knocking]

2341
02:25:23,080 --> 02:25:24,080
Who's that?

2342
02:25:31,240 --> 02:25:32,240
A box?

2343
02:25:34,240 --> 02:25:35,360
But wait...

2344
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:36,880
Oh, no!

2345
02:25:36,920 --> 02:25:38,040
Jesus!

2346
02:25:38,320 --> 02:25:39,760
O Holy Mother!

2347
02:25:52,800 --> 02:25:54,120
Turbo Jose...

2348
02:25:54,400 --> 02:25:55,760
Congrats.

2349
02:25:55,920 --> 02:25:57,520
Hope you like my gift.

2350
02:25:57,920 --> 02:25:59,760
You've successfully hunted down

2351
02:25:59,800 --> 02:26:01,520
a small fish from the vast sea.

2352
02:26:04,040 --> 02:26:06,040
But have you ever faced a deadly shark?

2353
02:26:06,200 --> 02:26:07,240
You surely will!

2354
02:26:07,240 --> 02:26:09,120
You won just a battle.

2355
02:26:09,600 --> 02:26:11,800
Welcome to the bloody war, man!
