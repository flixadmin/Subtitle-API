1
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:25,641
Pod.

2
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,943
Pod!

3
00:02:31,701 --> 00:02:33,492
Find Bronn or Varys.

4
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:36,991
Tell them I am here with Maester Pycelle.

5
00:02:37,623 --> 00:02:40,196
Tell them I am very much alive.

6
00:02:40,668 --> 00:02:41,782
Yes, my lord.

7
00:02:44,213 --> 00:02:46,834
Would you like something for the pain?

8
00:02:48,884 --> 00:02:50,295
What happened?

9
00:02:50,386 --> 00:02:53,387
The murderer and traitor Stannis Baratheon

10
00:02:53,472 --> 00:02:57,173
suffered a stunning defeat
at the hands of your father.

11
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:01,177
Where am I?

12
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:04,224
These are your new chambers.

13
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:09,065
A little cramped, perhaps,
but you don't need much room, do you?

14
00:03:10,781 --> 00:03:13,272
You are no longer Hand of the King.

15
00:03:22,376 --> 00:03:24,001
For your trouble.

16
00:03:48,235 --> 00:03:51,402
I, Joffrey of the House Baratheon,
first of my name,

17
00:03:52,072 --> 00:03:55,276
the rightful King of the Andals
and the First Men,

18
00:03:56,118 --> 00:03:59,618
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm,

19
00:03:59,705 --> 00:04:01,994
do hereby proclaim my grandfather,

20
00:04:02,082 --> 00:04:07,041
Tywin Lannister, the saviour of the city
and the Hand of the King.

21
00:04:20,476 --> 00:04:21,804
Thank you, Your Grace.

22
00:04:32,363 --> 00:04:34,770
Lord Petyr Baelish, step forward.

23
00:04:36,283 --> 00:04:39,403
For your good service and ingenuity

24
00:04:39,495 --> 00:04:42,116
in uniting the Houses of Lannister and Tyrell,

25
00:04:42,373 --> 00:04:45,457
I declare that you shall be granted
the castle of Harrenhal

26
00:04:45,543 --> 00:04:47,582
with all its attendant lands and incomes

27
00:04:48,212 --> 00:04:52,625
to be held by your sons and grandsons
from this day until the end of time.

28
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,469
You honour me beyond words, Your Grace.

29
00:04:57,304 --> 00:05:00,424
I shall have to acquire
some sons and grandsons.

30
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:06,603
Ser Loras Tyrell.

31
00:05:12,069 --> 00:05:14,441
Your house has come to our aid.

32
00:05:14,822 --> 00:05:17,823
The whole realm is in your debt,
none more so than I.

33
00:05:17,908 --> 00:05:20,993
If your family would ask anything of me,
ask it,

34
00:05:21,453 --> 00:05:23,327
and it shall be yours.

35
00:05:23,497 --> 00:05:24,872
Your Grace,

36
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:29,291
my sister Margaery,
her husband was taken from us before...

37
00:05:31,755 --> 00:05:32,918
She remains innocent.

38
00:05:34,049 --> 00:05:36,719
I would ask you to find it in your heart
to do us the great honour

39
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:39,176
of joining our houses.

40
00:05:40,389 --> 00:05:43,010
Is this what you want, Lady Margaery?

41
00:05:46,061 --> 00:05:48,268
With all my heart, Your Grace.

42
00:05:49,273 --> 00:05:51,645
I have come to love you from afar.

43
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:56,315
Tales of your courage and wisdom
have never been far from my ears.

44
00:05:57,197 --> 00:06:01,147
And those tales have taken root
deep inside of me.

45
00:06:04,747 --> 00:06:08,875
I, too, have heard tales
of your beauty and grace,

46
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:13,337
but the tales do not do you justice, my lady.

47
00:06:14,924 --> 00:06:17,675
It would be an honour to return your love,

48
00:06:18,385 --> 00:06:20,508
but I am promised to another.

49
00:06:22,431 --> 00:06:24,009
A king must keep his word.

50
00:06:24,099 --> 00:06:25,475
Your Grace,

51
00:06:25,684 --> 00:06:30,180
in the judgement of your Small Council,
it would be neither proper nor wise

52
00:06:30,272 --> 00:06:33,855
for you to wed the daughter
of a man beheaded for treason,

53
00:06:33,943 --> 00:06:38,403
a girl whose brother is in open rebellion
against the throne as we speak.

54
00:06:39,281 --> 00:06:42,864
For the good of the realm,
your councillors beg you

55
00:06:45,913 --> 00:06:48,404
to set Sansa Stark aside.

56
00:06:50,876 --> 00:06:52,584
Margaery!
We want Margaery!

57
00:06:57,132 --> 00:07:01,047
I would like to heed your wishes
and the wishes of my people,

58
00:07:01,136 --> 00:07:03,674
but I took a holy vow.

59
00:07:04,431 --> 00:07:05,676
Your Grace,

60
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:09,470
the gods do indeed hold betrothal solemn,

61
00:07:09,812 --> 00:07:14,059
but your father, blessed be his memory,

62
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:20,274
made this pact before the Starks
revealed their falseness.

63
00:07:21,615 --> 00:07:24,237
I have consulted with the High Septon

64
00:07:24,576 --> 00:07:28,325
and he assures me
that their crimes against the realm

65
00:07:28,998 --> 00:07:32,201
free you from any promise
you have made to them

66
00:07:32,918 --> 00:07:35,753
in the sight of the gods.

67
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:39,249
The gods are good.

68
00:07:39,591 --> 00:07:41,584
I am free to heed my heart.

69
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:45,512
Ser Loras, I will gladly wed your sweet sister.

70
00:07:46,807 --> 00:07:48,005
You will be my queen

71
00:07:49,476 --> 00:07:53,640
and I will love you from this day
until my last day.

72
00:08:16,545 --> 00:08:17,790
My lady.

73
00:08:19,423 --> 00:08:21,415
My sincerest condolences.

74
00:08:22,634 --> 00:08:24,461
They're right. I'm not good enough for him.

75
00:08:24,636 --> 00:08:26,380
You shouldn't say that.

76
00:08:26,555 --> 00:08:29,046
You'll be good enough for many things.

77
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:30,849
He'll still enjoy beating you.

78
00:08:31,643 --> 00:08:33,719
And now that you're a woman,

79
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:37,479
he'll be able to enjoy you
in other ways as well.

80
00:08:37,566 --> 00:08:39,974
But, if he's not marrying me...

81
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:42,026
He'll let you go home?

82
00:08:43,864 --> 00:08:47,315
Joffrey's not the sort of boy
who gives away his toys.

83
00:08:48,118 --> 00:08:52,496
You have a tender heart,
just like your mother did at your age.

84
00:08:52,581 --> 00:08:55,037
I can see so much of her in you.

85
00:08:56,627 --> 00:08:58,750
She was like a sister to me.

86
00:09:00,589 --> 00:09:04,290
For her sake, I'll help get you home.

87
00:09:08,097 --> 00:09:10,338
King's Landing is my home now.

88
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:13,975
Look around you.

89
00:09:14,728 --> 00:09:16,520
We're all liars here.

90
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,644
And every one of us is better than you.

91
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:33,449
Come in.

92
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:36,488
Make yourself comfortable.

93
00:09:43,257 --> 00:09:45,748
That doesn't look very comfortable.

94
00:09:46,593 --> 00:09:49,049
Here, watch me.

95
00:09:53,308 --> 00:09:55,978
- No need for that, my dear.
- You sure?

96
00:09:56,812 --> 00:09:58,520
Most men like what they see.

97
00:09:58,605 --> 00:10:00,397
I'm not like most men.

98
00:10:00,607 --> 00:10:02,730
That's what most men say.

99
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:06,442
If you don't want what most men want,

100
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:09,899
then you'd better tell me
what you'd like me to do.

101
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:11,784
I would like you

102
00:10:11,869 --> 00:10:16,198
to tell me if working for Lord Baelish
has been all you'd hoped it would be.

103
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,625
Have we met?

104
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:22,117
You wouldn't remember me if we had?

105
00:10:22,212 --> 00:10:23,671
I meet a lot of men.

106
00:10:23,755 --> 00:10:25,914
And I think you remember all of them.

107
00:10:26,717 --> 00:10:29,634
I think your true talents are wasted on them.

108
00:10:30,137 --> 00:10:32,176
You're very kind, my lord.

109
00:10:32,931 --> 00:10:34,675
Allow me to return the favour.

110
00:10:41,982 --> 00:10:43,476
You're afraid.

111
00:10:44,151 --> 00:10:46,606
Why? Nothing dangerous down there.

112
00:10:47,905 --> 00:10:49,185
I know who you are.

113
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:54,655
And, unlike your current employer,
I protect those who work for me.

114
00:10:55,454 --> 00:11:00,080
I don't abuse them to satisfy royal whims
or force them to abuse each other.

115
00:11:01,376 --> 00:11:02,574
How do you know about that?

116
00:11:03,795 --> 00:11:05,788
I thought you said you knew who I was.

117
00:11:08,008 --> 00:11:09,882
What can I do for you, Lord Varys?

118
00:11:23,148 --> 00:11:27,062
Littlefinger looks at you
and sees a collection of profitable holes.

119
00:11:28,195 --> 00:11:30,271
I see a potential partner.

120
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:34,908
- I'm afraid of him.
- Oh, you should be.

121
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,161
He's a dangerous man.

122
00:11:39,414 --> 00:11:41,822
But everyone has their weaknesses.

123
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:45,169
Your current employer hides his very well,

124
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:48,663
but not as well as he thinks.

125
00:11:53,178 --> 00:11:55,254
You're a virgin, I take it?

126
00:11:55,555 --> 00:11:56,670
Walk.

127
00:11:59,101 --> 00:12:01,508
Childhood must have been awful for you.

128
00:12:01,603 --> 00:12:04,390
Were you a foot taller than all the boys?

129
00:12:04,815 --> 00:12:07,436
They laughed at you, called you names?

130
00:12:07,567 --> 00:12:09,690
Some boys like a challenge.

131
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:13,190
One or two must have tried
to get inside Big Brienne.

132
00:12:13,282 --> 00:12:14,941
One or two tried.

133
00:12:15,033 --> 00:12:16,575
Ah.

134
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,534
But you fought them off.

135
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,529
But maybe you wished one of them could

136
00:12:20,622 --> 00:12:23,991
overpower you, fling you down,
tear off your clothes.

137
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:26,500
But none of them were strong enough.

138
00:12:26,586 --> 00:12:28,959
- I'm strong enough.
- Not interested.

139
00:12:29,047 --> 00:12:32,962
Of course you are. You'd love to know
what it feels like to be a woman.

140
00:12:36,221 --> 00:12:37,419
Ah.

141
00:12:37,514 --> 00:12:39,423
"They lay with lions."

142
00:12:39,599 --> 00:12:41,473
Tavern girls, I'd say.

143
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,967
Probably served my father's soldiers.

144
00:12:44,521 --> 00:12:47,439
Maybe one of them gave up a kiss and a feel.

145
00:12:47,941 --> 00:12:50,017
That's how they earned this.

146
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:53,944
The glorious work of
the Northern freedom fighters.

147
00:12:54,197 --> 00:12:56,237
Must make you proud to serve the Starks.

148
00:12:56,325 --> 00:12:58,317
I don't serve the Starks.

149
00:12:58,702 --> 00:13:00,529
I serve Lady Catelyn.

150
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:03,989
Tell yourself that tonight
when they swing in your dreams.

151
00:13:07,794 --> 00:13:10,001
- What are you doing?
- Burying them.

152
00:13:10,213 --> 00:13:13,417
We shouldn't stay here.
We should get back on the river.

153
00:13:14,134 --> 00:13:15,593
I think these women would understand if...

154
00:13:15,677 --> 00:13:17,088
I don't care what you think.

155
00:13:17,637 --> 00:13:19,547
I didn't leave it here. I had me dagger.

156
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:20,838
Untie me. Now!

157
00:13:20,932 --> 00:13:23,720
I gave it to you to cut the rope,
and now I don't have me dagger no more.

158
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:26,348
So unless it got stuck in your arse
on its way to your cunt,

159
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:29,273
it stands to reason that it's gone. Whoa.

160
00:13:31,026 --> 00:13:32,401
What's your business here?

161
00:13:33,195 --> 00:13:34,357
Travelling a prisoner.

162
00:13:37,949 --> 00:13:39,942
- You're a woman.
- A woman!

163
00:13:40,035 --> 00:13:41,577
Well, fuck me!

164
00:13:42,871 --> 00:13:45,077
If you've quite finished up...

165
00:13:47,834 --> 00:13:50,456
- All right, we'll be going.
- Whoa. Whoa!

166
00:13:52,214 --> 00:13:53,328
Who do you fight for?

167
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:55,961
The Starks.

168
00:13:57,636 --> 00:13:59,178
What did he do?

169
00:14:00,764 --> 00:14:04,762
- Apparently eating is now a crime. Who knew?
- No, stealing is a crime.

170
00:14:04,851 --> 00:14:07,425
But it's not a crime to starve.
That's justice for you.

171
00:14:07,521 --> 00:14:09,264
- Where are you taking him?
- To Riverrun.

172
00:14:09,564 --> 00:14:11,107
Why Riverrun?

173
00:14:11,191 --> 00:14:13,943
Steal from the Tullys,
it's their dungeons you rot in.

174
00:14:14,027 --> 00:14:16,269
- Why not kill him?
- For stealing a pig?

175
00:14:16,988 --> 00:14:18,566
I don't give the orders.

176
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:20,068
He must be important to someone.

177
00:14:20,158 --> 00:14:22,993
Sending him with you?
How important could he be?

178
00:14:24,371 --> 00:14:26,613
All right, have it your way,

179
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:28,864
my lady.

180
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,755
- Do I know you?
- Have you been to Ashemark?

181
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,498
- No.
- Then you don't know me.

182
00:14:37,926 --> 00:14:40,595
Do you ever go to the river market
at Salt Rock?

183
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:42,968
- Is it near Ashemark?
- No.

184
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:44,635
I've never been there.

185
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:47,177
What do you think of these beauties?

186
00:14:49,229 --> 00:14:50,807
I hope you gave them quick deaths.

187
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,682
Two of them we did, yeah.

188
00:14:55,944 --> 00:14:57,023
Wait.

189
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:01,984
I do know you.

190
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:04,777
That's Jaime Lannister.

191
00:15:05,495 --> 00:15:07,571
I wish someone had told me.
I wouldn't have had to steal that pig.

192
00:15:07,664 --> 00:15:10,072
If this is the Kingslayer,
I think I'd know about it.

193
00:15:10,167 --> 00:15:11,709
How do you know what
the Kingslayer looks like?

194
00:15:12,335 --> 00:15:14,494
I was at Whispering Wood. I saw him.

195
00:15:14,588 --> 00:15:17,043
They dragged him out of the woods
and threw him down before the king.

196
00:15:17,132 --> 00:15:19,623
He's not the Kingslayer.
Sorry to disappoint you.

197
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:21,627
If he was, I'd only be travelling his head.

198
00:15:22,053 --> 00:15:24,011
I have a question for you both.

199
00:15:24,097 --> 00:15:26,469
And I want you to answer it at the same time.

200
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:28,716
I count to three, you both answer.

201
00:15:29,352 --> 00:15:30,930
What's his name?

202
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:32,809
One.

203
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:36,057
Two. Three.

204
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,125
Two quick deaths.

205
00:16:21,363 --> 00:16:23,154
Those were Stark men.

206
00:16:23,657 --> 00:16:25,649
I don't serve the Starks.

207
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:28,445
I serve Lady Catelyn.

208
00:16:28,745 --> 00:16:32,577
I told you I'd take you to King's Landing,
and that's what I'm going to do.

209
00:16:35,126 --> 00:16:36,241
Stay.

210
00:16:54,563 --> 00:16:57,314
Walder Frey is a dangerous man to cross.

211
00:16:57,899 --> 00:16:59,097
I know that.

212
00:16:59,401 --> 00:17:01,607
And you mean to do it anyway?

213
00:17:05,198 --> 00:17:06,573
I love her.

214
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:09,652
I know that seems important to you.

215
00:17:09,744 --> 00:17:11,322
It is important to me.

216
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:16,582
Your father didn't love me when we married.

217
00:17:17,168 --> 00:17:19,410
He hardly knew me or I him.

218
00:17:21,506 --> 00:17:24,127
Love didn't just happen to us.

219
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,918
We built it slowly over the years,

220
00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:29,674
stone by stone,

221
00:17:30,098 --> 00:17:33,514
for you, for your brothers and sisters,
for all of us.

222
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,854
It's not as exciting as
secret passion in the woods,

223
00:17:39,566 --> 00:17:41,309
but it is stronger.

224
00:17:42,485 --> 00:17:44,063
It lasts longer.

225
00:17:45,947 --> 00:17:49,233
And that is what would be in store for me
with one of Walder Frey's daughters,

226
00:17:49,326 --> 00:17:51,733
- What you and father had?
- Why not?

227
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:53,781
Because she's not beautiful?

228
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:55,781
Because she's not exotic and exciting?

229
00:17:55,915 --> 00:17:58,786
Now you're arguing just to argue
because you arranged it.

230
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:00,704
And you agreed to it.

231
00:18:02,213 --> 00:18:04,087
You gave him your word.

232
00:18:04,758 --> 00:18:08,376
Treat your oaths recklessly,
and your people will do the same.

233
00:18:08,678 --> 00:18:10,137
If your father lived his life for one thing...

234
00:18:10,221 --> 00:18:11,881
My father is dead.

235
00:18:13,183 --> 00:18:17,015
And the only parent I have left
has no right to call anyone reckless.

236
00:18:37,165 --> 00:18:39,870
You said you saw my victory in the flames.

237
00:18:39,959 --> 00:18:41,122
I did.

238
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,327
- I still see it.
- The flames lied.

239
00:18:45,465 --> 00:18:47,707
And I'm no better than a savage

240
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:49,835
trusting in a fire God.

241
00:18:52,806 --> 00:18:55,557
I fought for your God in Blackwater Bay.

242
00:18:55,975 --> 00:18:58,976
I led my men to the gates of the seventh hell

243
00:18:59,354 --> 00:19:02,059
as their brothers burned alive, and for what?

244
00:19:03,191 --> 00:19:06,192
Attacked from behind
by Tywin Lannister and the Tyrells.

245
00:19:06,277 --> 00:19:08,187
If you see so much in your flames,
why didn't you warn me?

246
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:10,106
The Lord of Light only allows me glimpses.

247
00:19:10,198 --> 00:19:12,523
You claimed to speak for a God.

248
00:19:12,617 --> 00:19:14,775
Will you quit the war
just because you've lost a battle?

249
00:19:14,869 --> 00:19:17,195
You talk about war as if you understand it.

250
00:19:17,288 --> 00:19:19,246
I've been fighting far longer than you.

251
00:19:19,332 --> 00:19:20,495
Have you?

252
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:22,834
Show me how you fight.

253
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:27,584
Show me.

254
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,888
Where's your God now?

255
00:19:37,684 --> 00:19:39,308
Will he save you?

256
00:19:40,854 --> 00:19:42,514
Where is your God?

257
00:19:44,941 --> 00:19:46,316
Inside you.

258
00:19:56,661 --> 00:19:58,535
I murdered my brother.

259
00:20:06,963 --> 00:20:08,541
We murdered him.

260
00:20:09,758 --> 00:20:11,216
Share the weight with me.

261
00:20:11,301 --> 00:20:13,174
He wasn't your brother.

262
00:20:18,391 --> 00:20:20,431
This war has just begun.

263
00:20:20,727 --> 00:20:22,636
It will last for years.

264
00:20:23,396 --> 00:20:25,887
Thousands will die at your command.

265
00:20:27,567 --> 00:20:30,105
You will betray the men serving you.

266
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:33,402
You will betray your family.

267
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,241
You will betray everything
you once held dear.

268
00:20:39,287 --> 00:20:41,363
And it will all be worth it

269
00:20:42,123 --> 00:20:45,160
because you are the Son of Fire.

270
00:20:45,251 --> 00:20:47,707
You are the Warrior of Light.

271
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:53,418
You will sweep aside
this pretender and that one.

272
00:20:55,303 --> 00:20:56,928
You will be king.

273
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:03,217
You promise these things,

274
00:21:05,021 --> 00:21:06,729
but you don't know.

275
00:21:07,565 --> 00:21:09,190
None of us know.

276
00:21:10,151 --> 00:21:11,729
Let me show you.

277
00:21:21,204 --> 00:21:23,327
Look into the fire, my king.

278
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:24,904
Look.

279
00:21:26,793 --> 00:21:28,916
- I see fire.
- Keep looking.

280
00:21:37,554 --> 00:21:38,929
Do you see?

281
00:21:40,765 --> 00:21:42,556
Do you see, my king?

282
00:22:01,452 --> 00:22:02,567
Yes.

283
00:22:13,798 --> 00:22:15,589
I will kill that man.

284
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:19,465
I don't care how many arrows
they feather me with,

285
00:22:19,554 --> 00:22:21,760
how many spears they run through me,

286
00:22:21,848 --> 00:22:24,968
I will kill that horn-blowing cunt before I fall.

287
00:22:25,643 --> 00:22:28,265
They want you to know you're surrounded.

288
00:22:28,354 --> 00:22:29,896
I know I'm surrounded.

289
00:22:30,189 --> 00:22:32,562
I know that because
I stood on the battlements

290
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:34,643
and saw I was surrounded.

291
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:36,266
They don't want you to sleep.

292
00:22:36,654 --> 00:22:38,232
They want to sap your spirit before...

293
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:40,446
Thank you, wise bald man.

294
00:22:42,243 --> 00:22:45,161
Thank you for explaining siege tactics to me.

295
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:50,993
No word from my father?

296
00:22:52,754 --> 00:22:53,785
No.

297
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:56,797
Send more ravens.

298
00:22:58,384 --> 00:23:00,377
You killed all the ravens.

299
00:23:03,973 --> 00:23:06,381
The first time I saw Winterfell...

300
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:14,313
First time I saw Winterfell,

301
00:23:15,818 --> 00:23:19,863
it looked like something
that had been here for thousands of years

302
00:23:20,198 --> 00:23:23,816
and would be here for thousands of years
after I was dead.

303
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:27,946
I saw it and I thought,

304
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:32,954
"Of course, Ned Stark crushed our rebellion
and killed my brothers.

305
00:23:34,671 --> 00:23:36,747
"We never stood a chance against
the man who lives here."

306
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:39,544
Lord Stark went out of his way
to make it your home.

307
00:23:39,634 --> 00:23:44,260
Yes, my captors were so very kind to me.
You love reminding me of that.

308
00:23:46,099 --> 00:23:50,677
Everyone in this frozen pile of shit
has always loved reminding me of that.

309
00:23:53,606 --> 00:23:58,351
You know what it's like to be told
how lucky you are to be someone's prisoner?

310
00:23:59,904 --> 00:24:02,276
To be told how much you owe them?

311
00:24:05,118 --> 00:24:08,202
And then to go back home
to your real father...

312
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:13,620
I will kill that man.

313
00:24:13,751 --> 00:24:15,210
I swear to the Drowned God,

314
00:24:15,294 --> 00:24:16,789
the Old Gods, the New Gods,

315
00:24:16,879 --> 00:24:21,007
to every fucking God
in every fucking heaven, I will kill that man.

316
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:22,835
Theon, listen to me.

317
00:24:24,137 --> 00:24:25,845
I serve Winterfell.

318
00:24:26,639 --> 00:24:28,596
Now Winterfell is yours.

319
00:24:29,225 --> 00:24:31,514
I'm bound by oath to serve you.

320
00:24:31,811 --> 00:24:34,267
And what's your counsel, trusted friend?

321
00:24:34,814 --> 00:24:35,893
Run.

322
00:24:37,233 --> 00:24:40,982
Five hundred Northmen
wait outside the walls. You have 20 men.

323
00:24:41,779 --> 00:24:43,238
You can't win.

324
00:24:43,322 --> 00:24:44,982
Wait for nightfall and run.

325
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:47,323
There's nowhere to run.

326
00:24:47,827 --> 00:24:49,784
I'd never make it back to the Iron Islands.

327
00:24:49,871 --> 00:24:55,113
And even if I did, even if by some miracle
I slipped through the lines and made it home,

328
00:24:55,668 --> 00:24:57,293
I'd be a coward.

329
00:24:58,004 --> 00:24:59,795
The Greyjoy who ran.

330
00:25:02,008 --> 00:25:03,965
The shame of the family.

331
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:07,631
Don't go home.

332
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:11,049
Join the Night's Watch.

333
00:25:13,478 --> 00:25:15,885
Once a man has taken the black,

334
00:25:17,815 --> 00:25:19,974
he's beyond reach of the law.

335
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:23,560
All his past crimes are forgiven.

336
00:25:25,948 --> 00:25:28,071
I won't make it to the Wall.

337
00:25:28,201 --> 00:25:31,320
I won't make it 10 feet past
the Winterfell gates.

338
00:25:31,412 --> 00:25:32,954
There are ways.

339
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:37,787
Hidden passageways built
so the Lords of Winterfell could escape.

340
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:41,246
The road will be dangerous.

341
00:25:43,674 --> 00:25:45,667
But with a little luck...

342
00:25:49,013 --> 00:25:52,714
The Night's Watch
is an ancient, honourable order.

343
00:25:54,811 --> 00:25:57,136
You'll have opportunities there.

344
00:25:58,606 --> 00:26:02,224
The opportunity for Jon Snow
to cut my throat in my sleep.

345
00:26:03,152 --> 00:26:06,438
The opportunity to make amends
for what you've done.

346
00:26:09,033 --> 00:26:11,156
I've done a lot, haven't I?

347
00:26:12,578 --> 00:26:15,200
Things I never imagined myself doing.

348
00:26:17,792 --> 00:26:20,876
I've known you many years, Theon Greyjoy.

349
00:26:23,756 --> 00:26:26,674
You're not the man you're pretending to be.

350
00:26:29,345 --> 00:26:30,543
Not yet.

351
00:26:34,725 --> 00:26:36,385
You may be right.

352
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:42,897
But I've gone too far
to pretend to be anything else.

353
00:26:52,076 --> 00:26:53,570
You hear that?

354
00:26:55,037 --> 00:26:57,742
That's the mating call of the Northmen.

355
00:26:58,374 --> 00:26:59,749
They want to fuck us.

356
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:04,669
Well, I haven't had a good fuck in weeks.
I'm ready for one.

357
00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:09,668
They say every ironborn man
is worth a dozen from the mainland.

358
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,840
Aye!

359
00:27:11,804 --> 00:27:14,046
- You think they're right?
- Aye.

360
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:18,141
We die today, brothers.

361
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,391
We die bleeding from 100 wounds

362
00:27:22,481 --> 00:27:26,147
with arrows in our necks
and spears in our guts,

363
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:30,321
but our war cries will echo through eternity.

364
00:27:31,574 --> 00:27:34,195
They will sing about the battle of Winterfell

365
00:27:34,285 --> 00:27:36,990
until the Iron Islands
have slipped beneath the waves.

366
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:41,030
Every man, woman
and child will know who we were

367
00:27:41,125 --> 00:27:42,999
and how long we stood.

368
00:27:44,128 --> 00:27:45,788
Aggar and Gelmarr,

369
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,255
Wex and Urzen,

370
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,297
Stygg and Black Lorren.

371
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:52,633
Ironborn warriors will cry out our names

372
00:27:52,803 --> 00:27:56,172
as they leap onto the shores
of Seagard and Faircastle.

373
00:27:56,265 --> 00:27:57,380
Aye!

374
00:27:57,516 --> 00:28:00,007
- Mothers will name their sons for us.
- Aye!

375
00:28:00,102 --> 00:28:03,020
Girls will think of us
with their lovers inside them.

376
00:28:03,105 --> 00:28:04,220
Aye!

377
00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:09,606
And whoever kills that fucking horn-blower
will stand in bronze above the shores of Pyke!

378
00:28:09,737 --> 00:28:10,816
Aye!

379
00:28:10,905 --> 00:28:14,523
- What is dead may never die!
- What is dead may never die!

380
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:20,824
Thought he'd never shut up.

381
00:28:22,166 --> 00:28:24,787
It was a good speech. Didn't want to interrupt.

382
00:28:28,673 --> 00:28:30,131
What is this?

383
00:28:30,549 --> 00:28:31,794
What are you doing?

384
00:28:38,307 --> 00:28:39,801
Let's go home.

385
00:28:42,728 --> 00:28:44,009
Come on.

386
00:28:53,406 --> 00:28:54,781
Why should I believe you?

387
00:28:54,865 --> 00:28:56,692
Why would I lie about it?

388
00:28:56,784 --> 00:28:58,777
To create strife between my sister and me.

389
00:28:58,869 --> 00:29:01,574
Where before there was nothing but love.

390
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:06,240
Ser Mandon Moore tried to kill you
on your sister's orders.

391
00:29:07,128 --> 00:29:10,461
If it weren't for your squire's bravery,
you'd be a dead man.

392
00:29:12,049 --> 00:29:14,457
- Pod.
- Yes, my lord?

393
00:29:15,636 --> 00:29:20,464
Would it be excessive of me to ask you
to save my life twice in a week?

394
00:29:22,059 --> 00:29:24,384
- No, my lord.
- You're a good lad.

395
00:29:25,688 --> 00:29:26,968
Get Bronn, tell him

396
00:29:27,064 --> 00:29:30,350
I want four of his most loyal gold cloaks
outside my door at all times.

397
00:29:30,443 --> 00:29:34,061
I'm afraid your friend has been relieved
of his command of the City Watch.

398
00:29:35,323 --> 00:29:39,901
The gold cloaks are now firmly in the hands
of your father or your sister.

399
00:29:41,037 --> 00:29:43,243
It varies from cloak to cloak.

400
00:29:43,664 --> 00:29:46,202
- Then my hill tribesmen.
- Have gone home.

401
00:29:47,376 --> 00:29:50,081
Your father paid them quite handsomely.

402
00:29:52,923 --> 00:29:57,217
I'm afraid we won't be seeing each other
for some time, my lord.

403
00:29:58,596 --> 00:30:01,680
Don't want to swim too close
to a drowning man?

404
00:30:02,558 --> 00:30:04,883
And I thought we were friends.

405
00:30:05,019 --> 00:30:06,217
We are.

406
00:30:07,355 --> 00:30:09,312
Podrick, would you mind?

407
00:30:25,498 --> 00:30:30,243
There are many who know that without you
this city faced certain defeat.

408
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:33,585
The king won't give you any honours,

409
00:30:33,672 --> 00:30:35,879
the histories won't mention you,

410
00:30:37,134 --> 00:30:39,043
but we will not forget.

411
00:30:41,764 --> 00:30:42,962
Come along now, Podrick.

412
00:30:47,978 --> 00:30:49,223
My love.

413
00:30:50,314 --> 00:30:52,141
It was good of you to come.

414
00:30:52,233 --> 00:30:54,439
Good of me? Of course I come.

415
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:02,325
- I want to see you.
- Believe me, you don't.

416
00:31:02,952 --> 00:31:04,529
Have you looked?

417
00:31:05,996 --> 00:31:07,455
I will be the first.

418
00:31:31,981 --> 00:31:33,060
Well?

419
00:31:34,942 --> 00:31:36,222
You are a mess.

420
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:40,818
I'm a monster as well as a dwarf.

421
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:44,276
- You should charge me double.
- You think I'm here for money?

422
00:31:44,368 --> 00:31:46,195
That was the arrangement we made.

423
00:31:46,829 --> 00:31:48,905
I pay you and you lie to me.

424
00:31:48,998 --> 00:31:50,409
Oh.

425
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:52,830
I'm a poor little rich man
and nobody loves me,

426
00:31:52,918 --> 00:31:55,705
so I make jokes all the time
and pay them to laugh.

427
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,457
Fuck your money.

428
00:31:59,049 --> 00:32:00,544
- Let's leave.
- Leave?

429
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:04,466
Leave King's Landing. They tried to kill you.
They will try again.

430
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:07,971
Going into wars, fighting soldiers,
you're terrible at this.

431
00:32:09,894 --> 00:32:12,515
Let's take a boat to Pentos
and never come back.

432
00:32:12,605 --> 00:32:15,724
- You don't belong here.
- What would we do in Pentos?

433
00:32:15,983 --> 00:32:17,892
Eat, drink,

434
00:32:19,069 --> 00:32:20,398
fuck, live.

435
00:32:25,242 --> 00:32:27,116
I want to go with you.

436
00:32:27,411 --> 00:32:28,656
So do it.

437
00:32:28,746 --> 00:32:32,909
Your father, your sister, all these bad people,
they can't stop you.

438
00:32:33,209 --> 00:32:35,534
Forget about them. Come with me.

439
00:32:38,047 --> 00:32:39,245
I can't.

440
00:32:40,758 --> 00:32:42,418
I do belong here.

441
00:32:43,636 --> 00:32:46,921
These bad people are what I'm good at.

442
00:32:47,264 --> 00:32:49,091
Outtalking them, outthinking them.

443
00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:51,476
It's what I am.

444
00:32:53,479 --> 00:32:54,973
And I like it.

445
00:32:56,649 --> 00:32:59,603
I like it more than anything I've ever done.

446
00:33:04,615 --> 00:33:06,524
Are you going to leave?

447
00:33:12,831 --> 00:33:14,741
You have a shit memory.

448
00:33:17,503 --> 00:33:19,792
I am yours and you are mine.

449
00:33:32,393 --> 00:33:34,385
In the sight of the Seven,

450
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:37,812
I hereby seal these two souls,

451
00:33:39,191 --> 00:33:43,189
binding them as one for eternity.

452
00:33:47,241 --> 00:33:49,032
Look upon one another

453
00:33:49,952 --> 00:33:51,612
and say the words.

454
00:33:55,666 --> 00:33:57,409
- Father, smith...
- Father, smith...

455
00:33:57,543 --> 00:33:59,286
- Warrior, mother...
- Warrior, mother...

456
00:33:59,587 --> 00:34:02,338
- Maiden, crone, stranger.
- Maiden, crone, stranger.

457
00:34:03,257 --> 00:34:05,795
- I am hers and she is mine...
- I am his and he is mine...

458
00:34:05,884 --> 00:34:09,503
- From this day until the end of my days.
- From this day until the end of my days.

459
00:34:33,621 --> 00:34:38,117
A house of ghosts, Khaleesi. It is known.

460
00:34:54,141 --> 00:34:55,968
Where are the guards?

461
00:34:56,060 --> 00:35:01,600
No guards.
The warlocks kill with sorcery, not steel.

462
00:35:02,399 --> 00:35:04,855
Let them try.

463
00:35:17,915 --> 00:35:19,575
Is this a riddle?

464
00:35:59,873 --> 00:36:01,783
Khaleesi!

465
00:36:03,168 --> 00:36:04,497
Khaleesi!

466
00:36:07,756 --> 00:36:09,001
Khaleesi!

467
00:36:13,178 --> 00:36:16,298
Are you trying to frighten me
with magic tricks?

468
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,638
You want me? Here I am.
Are you afraid of a little girl?

469
00:36:45,627 --> 00:36:47,287
How did he find us?

470
00:37:12,154 --> 00:37:14,989
- What are you doing here?
- Waiting for you.

471
00:37:15,699 --> 00:37:18,190
How did you know we'd come this way?

472
00:37:18,368 --> 00:37:21,868
After all the things you have seen,
this is your question?

473
00:37:22,164 --> 00:37:24,370
How did you kill those guards?

474
00:37:24,958 --> 00:37:26,369
Was it hard?

475
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:29,880
No harder than taking a new name,
if you know the way.

476
00:37:29,963 --> 00:37:31,374
Show me how.

477
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:35,756
- I want to be able to do it, too.
- If you would learn, you must come with me.

478
00:37:36,094 --> 00:37:37,257
Where?

479
00:37:37,387 --> 00:37:40,388
Far and away across
the Narrow Sea to Braavos.

480
00:37:41,266 --> 00:37:43,223
My dancing master was from Braavos.

481
00:37:43,936 --> 00:37:48,230
To be a dancing master is a special thing,
but to be a faceless man,

482
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:50,310
that is something else entirely.

483
00:37:51,735 --> 00:37:53,893
The girl has many names on her lips.

484
00:37:53,987 --> 00:37:56,395
Joffrey, Cersei, Tywin Lannister,

485
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,567
Ilyn Payne, the Hound.

486
00:37:59,034 --> 00:38:01,406
Names to offer up to the Red God.

487
00:38:02,663 --> 00:38:05,829
She could offer them all one by one.

488
00:38:08,627 --> 00:38:09,955
I want to.

489
00:38:13,131 --> 00:38:14,542
But I can't.

490
00:38:15,676 --> 00:38:18,249
I need to find my brother and mother.

491
00:38:19,763 --> 00:38:21,257
And my sister.

492
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,057
I need to find her, too.

493
00:38:26,353 --> 00:38:28,013
Then we must part.

494
00:38:28,397 --> 00:38:30,389
A man has duties as well.

495
00:38:31,066 --> 00:38:32,940
- Here.
- What is it?

496
00:38:34,403 --> 00:38:36,276
A coin of great value.

497
00:38:37,906 --> 00:38:39,698
Could it buy a horse?

498
00:38:39,825 --> 00:38:42,612
It is not meant for the buying of horses.

499
00:38:42,911 --> 00:38:44,619
Then what good is it?

500
00:38:44,705 --> 00:38:46,993
If the day comes
when you must find me again,

501
00:38:47,082 --> 00:38:50,416
just give that coin to any man from Braavos
and say these words to him,

502
00:38:51,169 --> 00:38:52,794
"Valar Morghulis."

503
00:38:53,714 --> 00:38:55,291
Valar Morghulis.

504
00:38:59,469 --> 00:39:01,129
Please don't go, Jaqen.

505
00:39:04,808 --> 00:39:06,302
Jaqen is dead.

506
00:39:07,269 --> 00:39:09,511
Say it again. Valar Morghulis.

507
00:39:10,314 --> 00:39:11,938
Valar Morghulis.

508
00:39:13,609 --> 00:39:14,688
Good.

509
00:39:22,034 --> 00:39:23,825
Farewell, Arya Stark.

510
00:39:48,602 --> 00:39:51,271
Osha, what are you doing?

511
00:41:15,856 --> 00:41:17,564
Tell us what medicine
to get from your chambers.

512
00:41:17,733 --> 00:41:20,520
- We'll make you better.
- I feel just fine.

513
00:41:24,156 --> 00:41:27,275
They burned it down. They burned everything.

514
00:41:27,367 --> 00:41:30,037
Not everything. Not you.

515
00:41:33,707 --> 00:41:35,616
But they may come back. You have to go.

516
00:41:36,209 --> 00:41:37,668
Put on your warmest clothes.

517
00:41:37,753 --> 00:41:39,994
Pack as much food as you can carry
and go north.

518
00:41:40,088 --> 00:41:41,962
North's the wrong way.

519
00:41:42,299 --> 00:41:43,959
And Mother and brother are south.

520
00:41:44,092 --> 00:41:45,836
We don't know where.

521
00:41:46,136 --> 00:41:48,841
There are too many enemies in the south.

522
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:50,966
Go to the Wall, to Jon.

523
00:41:51,183 --> 00:41:53,887
He'll look after you
and let your mother know you're safe.

524
00:41:53,977 --> 00:41:55,970
I don't want to leave you.

525
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:59,352
No more than I want to leave you.

526
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,729
I pulled you into the world.

527
00:42:03,528 --> 00:42:04,643
Both of you.

528
00:42:05,489 --> 00:42:08,406
I've seen both your faces
almost every day since.

529
00:42:08,492 --> 00:42:11,065
And for that, I consider myself very,

530
00:42:11,995 --> 00:42:13,324
very lucky.

531
00:42:14,998 --> 00:42:17,121
Go now with Hodor. Go on.

532
00:42:18,168 --> 00:42:19,911
I'll be right here.

533
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:28,834
Osha.

534
00:42:30,097 --> 00:42:31,970
You must protect them.

535
00:42:32,307 --> 00:42:34,430
You're the only one who can.

536
00:42:37,145 --> 00:42:40,265
You may have to protect them
against your own kind.

537
00:42:40,357 --> 00:42:42,812
I've got no great love for my own kind.

538
00:42:46,154 --> 00:42:48,443
I'll get you milk of the poppy.

539
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:52,275
- Tell me where to find it.
- I don't want milk of the poppy.

540
00:43:02,879 --> 00:43:04,160
Do it quickly.

541
00:47:05,538 --> 00:47:07,116
Moon of my life.

542
00:47:17,801 --> 00:47:21,881
This is dark magic, like the magic
that took you from me.

543
00:47:22,806 --> 00:47:25,760
Took you from me before I could even...

544
00:47:27,852 --> 00:47:31,684
Maybe I am dead and I just don't know it yet.

545
00:47:31,773 --> 00:47:35,058
Maybe I am with you in the Night Lands.

546
00:47:35,151 --> 00:47:39,813
Or maybe I refused to enter the Night Lands
without you.

547
00:47:39,948 --> 00:47:46,235
Maybe I told the Great Stallion to go fuck
himself and came back here to wait for you.

548
00:47:46,871 --> 00:47:49,825
That sounds like something you would do.

549
00:47:59,342 --> 00:48:04,847
Or maybe it is a dream.
Your dream, my dream...

550
00:48:04,973 --> 00:48:06,764
...I do not know.

551
00:48:08,518 --> 00:48:11,851
These are questions
for wise men with skinny arms.

552
00:48:14,441 --> 00:48:17,276
You are the moon of my life.

553
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:20,195
That is all I know...

554
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:23,281
...and all I need to know.

555
00:48:25,535 --> 00:48:27,943
And if this is a dream...

556
00:48:28,788 --> 00:48:33,035
...I will kill the man who tries to wake me.

557
00:48:56,941 --> 00:49:00,441
Until the sun rises in the west
and sets in the east,

558
00:49:03,156 --> 00:49:05,113
until the rivers run dry

559
00:49:05,909 --> 00:49:08,993
and the mountains blow
in the wind like leaves.

560
00:49:50,703 --> 00:49:52,613
They miss their mother.

561
00:49:53,957 --> 00:49:55,499
They want to be with you.

562
00:49:55,583 --> 00:49:57,375
Do you want to be with them?

563
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:58,871
You will be.

564
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:03,962
When your dragons were born,
our magic was born again.

565
00:50:04,467 --> 00:50:05,961
It is strongest in their presence.

566
00:50:06,844 --> 00:50:09,170
And they are strongest in yours.

567
00:50:10,473 --> 00:50:12,347
You will be with them,

568
00:50:13,184 --> 00:50:15,307
through winter, summer,

569
00:50:16,271 --> 00:50:17,895
winter again.

570
00:50:18,648 --> 00:50:21,139
Across a thousand, thousand seasons

571
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:22,984
you will be with them.

572
00:50:23,069 --> 00:50:26,189
And we will be with you
until time comes to an end.

573
00:50:32,161 --> 00:50:35,032
Welcome home, Daenerys Stormborn.

574
00:50:35,957 --> 00:50:37,581
This is not my home.

575
00:50:37,667 --> 00:50:41,083
My home is across the sea,
where my people are waiting for me.

576
00:50:41,421 --> 00:50:43,294
They will be waiting a long time.

577
00:51:01,274 --> 00:51:02,519
Dracarys.

578
00:51:51,157 --> 00:51:53,399
We should be there by sundown.

579
00:51:53,951 --> 00:51:57,949
Won't be a fun night for you.
Mance knows how to make crows sing.

580
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:04,035
If you know what to say,
you might just make it through the night.

581
00:52:06,798 --> 00:52:09,289
Not talking's not the way to go.

582
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:12,677
Careful with that.

583
00:52:12,762 --> 00:52:14,671
You might cut yourself.

584
00:52:15,765 --> 00:52:17,674
Never swung a sword before, have you?

585
00:52:17,767 --> 00:52:19,345
You look like a baby with a rattle.

586
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:20,592
Enough of that!

587
00:52:31,447 --> 00:52:33,107
- Stop!
- Why, traitor?

588
00:52:33,491 --> 00:52:36,694
So you can give Mance Rayder
an invitation to Castle Black?

589
00:52:36,786 --> 00:52:37,949
Let 'em fight.

590
00:52:58,558 --> 00:53:01,131
That's it? That's what you can do?

591
00:53:01,686 --> 00:53:03,228
You little shit.

592
00:53:08,651 --> 00:53:10,311
Your traitor father teach you that?

593
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,067
Or was it your whore mother?

594
00:53:34,635 --> 00:53:37,802
We are the watchers on the Wall.

595
00:53:51,027 --> 00:53:52,687
You can tell Mance

596
00:53:53,863 --> 00:53:56,401
that's the man who killed Qhorin Halfhand.

597
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,837
- Burn the body.
Aye.

598
00:54:13,007 --> 00:54:15,925
You don't want this one coming back for you.

599
00:54:29,357 --> 00:54:31,065
Come along, Jon Snow.

600
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:59,929
Time to meet the King-beyond-the-Wall.

601
00:55:46,642 --> 00:55:47,971
What the...

602
00:55:54,817 --> 00:55:56,276
Khaleesi, please.

603
00:55:56,652 --> 00:55:58,396
He said you'd never leave Qarth alive.

604
00:55:58,487 --> 00:55:59,519
Come.

605
00:56:31,354 --> 00:56:32,599
Nothing.

606
00:56:40,696 --> 00:56:43,401
Thank you, Xaro Xhoan Daxos.

607
00:56:44,325 --> 00:56:46,650
Thank you for teaching me this lesson.

608
00:56:49,872 --> 00:56:53,122
I am king of Qarth.
I can help you now, truly help you.

609
00:56:53,709 --> 00:56:55,085
We can take the Iron Throne.

610
00:56:55,169 --> 00:56:57,541
- I'll bring you a thousand ships.
- Please, Khaleesi, I beg you.

611
00:56:57,630 --> 00:56:59,504
All that you have dreamed
is within your reach!

612
00:56:59,590 --> 00:57:01,250
I beg you, please!

613
00:57:02,843 --> 00:57:05,251
- Khaleesi.
- Please! Please!

614
00:57:05,346 --> 00:57:07,173
Khaleesi!

615
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:28,904
It's all a lie.

616
00:57:30,329 --> 00:57:32,286
Looks real enough to me.

617
00:57:36,919 --> 00:57:38,959
Real enough to buy a ship?

618
00:57:40,381 --> 00:57:42,954
Aye, a small ship.

619
00:57:48,931 --> 00:57:53,392
Take all the gold and jewels.

620
00:58:27,303 --> 00:58:30,506
I thought we were coming north
to fight wildlings.

621
00:58:33,517 --> 00:58:34,976
Is this goat?

622
00:58:35,811 --> 00:58:37,140
It's moose.

623
00:58:38,439 --> 00:58:41,309
People shouldn't live anywhere
you need to burn shit to keep warm.

624
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:44,485
Well, you see a tree, let me know.

625
00:58:47,656 --> 00:58:49,863
If you step back and think about it,

626
00:58:49,950 --> 00:58:52,157
the thing about Gilly that's so interesting is...

627
00:58:52,244 --> 00:58:54,320
- Just bloody kill me.
- No, truly.

628
00:58:54,872 --> 00:59:00,328
The thing about her that I find so interesting
is that after all that Craster's done to her,

629
00:59:00,628 --> 00:59:02,916
she's still got hope that life might get better.

630
00:59:03,005 --> 00:59:06,125
The thing about Gilly
that you find so interesting

631
00:59:06,217 --> 00:59:08,672
is that she said six words to you.

632
00:59:09,512 --> 00:59:12,548
And the thing about you
that I find so interesting

633
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,467
is absolutely nothing.

634
00:59:17,978 --> 00:59:20,730
It's Jon and the Halfhand. They're back.

635
00:59:25,402 --> 00:59:27,146
Two blasts is wildlings.

636
00:59:27,238 --> 00:59:30,108
You're not fighting them alone. Come on.

637
00:59:34,411 --> 00:59:35,787
Three blasts?

638
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:37,325
Run!

639
00:59:44,046 --> 00:59:46,252
Wait! Wait for me!

640
00:59:50,094 --> 00:59:51,208
Grenn!

641
00:59:52,847 --> 00:59:53,878
Edd!
