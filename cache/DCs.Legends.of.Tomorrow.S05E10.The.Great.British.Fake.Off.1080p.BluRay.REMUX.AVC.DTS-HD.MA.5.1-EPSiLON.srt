00:00:01,712 --> 00:00:03,392
<i>Previously on</i>
Legends of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:03,463 --> 00:00:05,066
- How did you do that?
- How did I do that?

3
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:06,425
Remember when we dented history?

4
00:00:06,508 --> 00:00:09,052
By building Heyworld,
we changed the future.

5
00:00:09,136 --> 00:00:12,055
<i>What you think of as a haunting
is a temporal echo.</i>

6
00:00:12,139 --> 00:00:13,891
<i>She is the you before... you.</i>

7
00:00:13,974 --> 00:00:15,058
<i>Sara, no.</i>

8
00:00:15,142 --> 00:00:16,268
<i>My sister...</i>

9
00:00:16,351 --> 00:00:18,437
- You can't kill me.
- No!

10
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,520
<i>I'm a god.</i>

11
00:00:22,442 --> 00:00:24,044
We're being hunted
by a pair of bloody gods.

12
00:00:24,067 --> 00:00:26,069
<i>This situation just got
a hell of a lot more dicey.</i>

13
00:00:26,153 --> 00:00:28,906
Behrad, he's dead.
Can that Loom bring him back?

14
00:00:28,989 --> 00:00:30,365
If we get the last piece, yeah.

15
00:00:40,667 --> 00:00:41,835
Oh, there you are.

16
00:00:41,919 --> 00:00:44,713
It's always the artsy types with you,
ain't it?

17
00:00:44,796 --> 00:00:46,506
How many times must I tell you

18
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,551
my powers are not a tool
for your amusement, Clotho?

19
00:00:49,635 --> 00:00:50,904
<i>Wait, wait, wait... time-out.</i>

20
00:00:50,928 --> 00:00:52,864
But you did look different at the time,
though, right?

21
00:00:52,888 --> 00:00:54,473
Shapeshifter. 'Course I did.

22
00:00:54,556 --> 00:00:57,351
But it makes the story easier
to imagine, if you just picture me.

23
00:00:57,434 --> 00:00:59,144
- Yeah, just pay attention.
- Yeah, yeah.

24
00:00:59,228 --> 00:01:01,605
Anyway, then she said her magic word...

25
00:01:02,022 --> 00:01:03,523
Enchantress.

26
00:01:07,736 --> 00:01:11,323
I imagine this has something to do
with your theft of the Loom of Fate?

27
00:01:11,657 --> 00:01:12,824
You disapprove?

28
00:01:14,076 --> 00:01:15,410
No.

29
00:01:15,494 --> 00:01:19,164
Humanity's status quo should be
shaken up every few millennia.

30
00:01:19,248 --> 00:01:20,582
It's good for them.

31
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:25,504
Well, I'm glad you think so,
because this is a pretty big shake-up.

32
00:01:25,587 --> 00:01:27,589
I need to make sure
that no one ever finds this.

33
00:01:28,257 --> 00:01:30,592
Not even me,
and especially not Lachesis.

34
00:01:30,676 --> 00:01:32,836
- You think you can do that?
<i>- Question.</i>

35
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,888
- La-who?
- Lachesis.

36
00:01:34,972 --> 00:01:38,183
She's my older sister
and also the leader of the Fates.

37
00:01:38,267 --> 00:01:40,269
Now, she's a real master manipulator.

38
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:42,396
Atropos kills because Lachesis wills it.

39
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,816
It is you, Clotho,
that has the difficult task.

40
00:01:46,191 --> 00:01:47,693
What, running and hiding?

41
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:49,653
I am relieving you
of a piece of the Loom

42
00:01:49,736 --> 00:01:52,114
that has been your entire reason
for existence.

43
00:01:52,197 --> 00:01:54,491
Now, that you are free of it...

44
00:01:54,574 --> 00:01:56,827
it will be up to you
to determine what, if anything,

45
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,745
is left of Clotho in its wake.

46
00:01:59,288 --> 00:02:02,916
All I need is to make sure that
that ring is never found.

47
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,544
Existential actualization
can come later.

48
00:02:09,798 --> 00:02:11,758
You cannot run forever, Clotho.

49
00:02:14,136 --> 00:02:15,846
And that's the last thing I remember.

50
00:02:15,929 --> 00:02:18,432
You have no idea
what spell Enchantress cast?

51
00:02:18,515 --> 00:02:21,226
That would defeat the whole point
of goin' to her, now, wouldn't it?

52
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,895
Charlie, all we need is the third ring
to bring Behrad back.

53
00:02:23,979 --> 00:02:26,064
And now, you're telling us
it's impossible to find?

54
00:02:26,148 --> 00:02:29,151
Maybe you could have mentioned that
before your sister got on the ship.

55
00:02:29,234 --> 00:02:31,129
See, this is exactly the kind of thing
I was afraid would happen.

56
00:02:31,153 --> 00:02:32,111
Stop!

57
00:02:32,112 --> 00:02:34,281
Passing blame
is not gonna help anything.

58
00:02:35,324 --> 00:02:36,366
I'm sorry, Z.

59
00:02:36,867 --> 00:02:39,286
This Enchantress is a witch, right?

60
00:02:39,453 --> 00:02:40,537
Well, we have...

61
00:02:41,121 --> 00:02:42,497
whatever it is you are.

62
00:02:42,581 --> 00:02:44,791
So, do some hocus-pocus
and find the ring.

63
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:47,794
Yeah, well, it's not as simple
as finding Atropos' ring, love.

64
00:02:47,878 --> 00:02:50,589
Locating something hidden by someone
as powerful as Enchantress,

65
00:02:50,672 --> 00:02:52,232
that can take months, maybe even years.

66
00:02:52,299 --> 00:02:54,301
I don't accept that.

67
00:02:54,384 --> 00:02:56,219
Behrad is gone and he's not coming back

68
00:02:56,303 --> 00:02:57,888
until you find the ring.

69
00:02:58,263 --> 00:03:00,432
So, figure it out, magic man.

70
00:03:02,225 --> 00:03:03,477
Fast.

71
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,001
Hey.

72
00:03:29,378 --> 00:03:30,545
You know,

73
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,465
I'm here for you if you ever
want to talk about Behrad.

74
00:03:34,424 --> 00:03:36,009
We're getting him back.

75
00:03:37,386 --> 00:03:41,056
There's no point in dwelling on it,
because everything's going to be fine.

76
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:42,139
Totally.

77
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:46,103
By the way, when I went on
that totem journey thing...

78
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,481
I met the other me.

79
00:03:50,857 --> 00:03:51,858
Really?

80
00:03:54,653 --> 00:03:55,821
How... how is she?

81
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:00,075
She's great. Tough, cool...

82
00:04:00,951 --> 00:04:03,537
You must have a thing for warrior women.

83
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:08,166
Only if they're from another time period
and eventually will leave me. Sure.

84
00:04:09,794 --> 00:04:11,670
Did she have a message for me?

85
00:04:12,712 --> 00:04:13,713
No.

86
00:04:17,592 --> 00:04:21,012
But I can tell
she really cares about you.

87
00:04:21,972 --> 00:04:23,390
I really care about her.

88
00:04:24,266 --> 00:04:26,226
And just so you know, I, uh...

89
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:27,936
care about you, too.

90
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:34,192
Oh, all right, lovebirds,
look, I think I've got something.

91
00:04:34,276 --> 00:04:36,611
Now, it won't be pretty,
but it might just work.

92
00:04:36,695 --> 00:04:37,904
So, come on. Chop-chop.

93
00:05:01,219 --> 00:05:02,679
Sara! Are you there?

94
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,140
Hey, Sara!

95
00:05:06,391 --> 00:05:07,391
Sara?

96
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:10,645
- You all right?
- Yeah. I just, um...

97
00:05:13,315 --> 00:05:16,151
It was nothing. I'm good.

98
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:20,197
Listen, you got hit full-force
with the power of Atropos.

99
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,781
- Yeah?
- I know you survived,

100
00:05:21,865 --> 00:05:23,342
but there still could be repercussions.

101
00:05:23,366 --> 00:05:27,787
Charlie... look, I'm telling you,
I'm completely fine. All right?

102
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:29,873
Assassin's honor.

103
00:05:30,415 --> 00:05:31,415
Fine.

104
00:05:33,084 --> 00:05:34,804
All right, you lot.
Listen up.

105
00:05:34,836 --> 00:05:37,964
Lachesis' ring could be anywhere
in space and time.

106
00:05:38,048 --> 00:05:40,693
I'm going to need to borrow a little bit
of magical energy off you lot

107
00:05:40,717 --> 00:05:42,511
to help amplify the summoning spell.

108
00:05:42,761 --> 00:05:45,138
- Exactly how does that work?
- That's easy.

109
00:05:45,222 --> 00:05:46,616
All you need to do
is keep your mouths shut

110
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,767
and let me use your auras
like batteries.

111
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,578
- Is this safe? It doesn't sound safe.
- It isn't.

112
00:05:50,602 --> 00:05:53,355
Any more questions? Good.
Let's hold hands.

113
00:06:07,077 --> 00:06:09,996
- Whoa. This feels weird!
- It is weird.

114
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,123
Kinda like that time
we went mushroom picking.

115
00:06:12,207 --> 00:06:14,459
Focus, or you'll botch the bloody spell!

116
00:06:37,691 --> 00:06:39,192
- Sara!
- Focus!

117
00:07:05,802 --> 00:07:07,429
Where is everyone?

118
00:07:10,473 --> 00:07:12,225
Wait. Something happened.

119
00:07:12,809 --> 00:07:14,019
Oh, bollocks.

120
00:07:14,477 --> 00:07:16,438
When everyone lost focus,
I had successfully

121
00:07:16,521 --> 00:07:17,641
bound the ring to the house,

122
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:20,066
but I was still working
to anchor it temporally.

123
00:07:20,775 --> 00:07:24,154
So, you, me and the ring
have been whooshed into the past?

124
00:07:24,237 --> 00:07:25,488
Good work.

125
00:07:25,614 --> 00:07:28,742
It's magic, love.
It's more of an art than a science.

126
00:07:28,825 --> 00:07:31,745
Oh, my, are those guests?

127
00:07:31,828 --> 00:07:33,663
I didn't hear the bell ring.

128
00:07:34,122 --> 00:07:38,209
Well, hello! I'm Mrs. Hughes.
I'm so sorry to keep you waiting.

129
00:07:38,335 --> 00:07:40,211
Oh, no bother, love.

130
00:07:40,587 --> 00:07:43,256
This is a lovely... boarding house.

131
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,383
You know,
I could see myself living here.

132
00:07:45,467 --> 00:07:48,553
Now, wherever did my etui get to?

133
00:07:48,637 --> 00:07:49,679
Is it that?

134
00:07:51,681 --> 00:07:52,932
Thank you, my dear.

135
00:07:53,016 --> 00:07:56,061
I would have found it eventually.

136
00:07:56,144 --> 00:07:59,064
Sometimes, one just needs
to stop looking.

137
00:07:59,147 --> 00:08:00,690
Right, totally.

138
00:08:00,774 --> 00:08:03,610
Oh, is that another guest already?

139
00:08:04,527 --> 00:08:06,321
It is, indeed.

140
00:08:06,488 --> 00:08:08,114
Doctor White at your service.

141
00:08:09,908 --> 00:08:11,910
Were you two
going to book a room, or...

142
00:08:11,993 --> 00:08:14,371
Right you are. Yes.
Me and my wife here...

143
00:08:14,454 --> 00:08:17,666
Oh, we're not married.

144
00:08:17,749 --> 00:08:20,168
Well, I'm afraid I'm a bit traditional.

145
00:08:20,251 --> 00:08:23,963
I don't allow single women
to stay in my establishment.

146
00:08:24,964 --> 00:08:27,592
But we are engaged. Yay!

147
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,887
My sincerest congratulations!

148
00:08:31,346 --> 00:08:33,890
- Please sign here.
- Oh, yes, of course.

149
00:08:36,476 --> 00:08:39,896
And you will be in
room number three, upstairs.

150
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:41,898
Supper is at 8:00, sharp.

151
00:08:42,357 --> 00:08:44,359
All right, thank you. Mr. White.

152
00:08:49,406 --> 00:08:53,243
Huh. You know, you should take note.
This place can actually look decent

153
00:08:53,326 --> 00:08:54,953
with a bit of TLC.

154
00:08:55,036 --> 00:08:56,847
See what a difference a nice set
of curtains can make?

155
00:08:56,871 --> 00:09:00,083
Yeah, all right. Now, let's take stock
of our situation, shall we?

156
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,669
Now, I'm assuming you can wield
the totem like Behrad.

157
00:09:02,794 --> 00:09:04,629
Mm-mm.
I'm just holding onto this for him.

158
00:09:04,713 --> 00:09:05,964
I don't have a superpower.

159
00:09:06,256 --> 00:09:08,758
- Unless you count having flawless brows.
- I don't.

160
00:09:09,217 --> 00:09:10,510
Oh, and by age 15,

161
00:09:10,593 --> 00:09:13,513
I built a social media empire
valued at over 500 million dollars.

162
00:09:13,596 --> 00:09:15,741
<i>The New York Times</i> called me
the most influential influencer

163
00:09:15,765 --> 00:09:18,560
- of my generation.
- Oh, <i>The New York Times,</i> eh?

164
00:09:18,643 --> 00:09:20,496
Yeah, it's, like,
an app that tells you the news.

165
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:25,567
So, your superpower
is that you're sort of popular?

166
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:29,571
Oh, calling me "sort of" popular is like
calling da Vinci "sort of" a genius.

167
00:09:29,654 --> 00:09:31,948
Great. Got it.

168
00:09:32,657 --> 00:09:35,243
What about you?
What exactly do you do,

169
00:09:35,326 --> 00:09:38,329
besides wear the same outfit everyday,
and screw up spells?

170
00:09:38,413 --> 00:09:41,541
I've banished demons, slain dragons
and walked through the fires of Hell.

171
00:09:41,624 --> 00:09:43,978
I'm a sneaky bastard and
the greatest sorcerer that ever lived.

172
00:09:44,002 --> 00:09:45,730
Cool, cool, cool. Do you wanna go ahead
and "sorcer" something

173
00:09:45,754 --> 00:09:47,514
so, we can find the ring
and get out of here?

174
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:50,467
- Hmm. Yeah.
- Yeah.

175
00:10:00,727 --> 00:10:03,021
Okay. So, does that mean it's in there?

176
00:10:03,104 --> 00:10:05,690
Yeah, it seems so.
This is the doctor's room.

177
00:10:05,774 --> 00:10:09,319
Maybe you could, uh, "influence" him out
while I go check it out?

178
00:10:09,444 --> 00:10:11,529
Mm. See? You need my skill set already.

179
00:10:12,822 --> 00:10:15,158
Yeah, all right. Good luck.

180
00:10:23,249 --> 00:10:24,250
Can I help you?

181
00:10:26,544 --> 00:10:29,547
I seem to have come down
with something, Doctor.

182
00:10:29,631 --> 00:10:31,841
Might you be able to give me a checkup?

183
00:10:31,925 --> 00:10:33,802
Of course. I'd be happy to help.

184
00:10:34,344 --> 00:10:36,179
Please. Come in.

185
00:10:37,055 --> 00:10:39,641
Perhaps we could go down
to the sitting room.

186
00:10:39,724 --> 00:10:42,352
I am a newly-engaged woman, after all.

187
00:10:42,435 --> 00:10:45,104
I understand. One moment.

188
00:10:48,775 --> 00:10:51,569
Ah. Hmm!

189
00:10:58,785 --> 00:10:59,869
No ring?

190
00:11:00,537 --> 00:11:02,455
We're still looking for one.

191
00:11:02,539 --> 00:11:05,124
And you arrived with no luggage,
if I'm not mistaken.

192
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:06,852
Couldn't wait to get away
from the city.

193
00:11:06,876 --> 00:11:08,628
Yes, I could see why your betrothed

194
00:11:08,711 --> 00:11:11,714
would want to get you to himself
as quickly as possible.

195
00:11:11,798 --> 00:11:14,342
- You have a beautiful face.
- Oh, thank you.

196
00:11:14,425 --> 00:11:16,886
- I moisturize.
- It's not like my face.

197
00:11:17,971 --> 00:11:19,722
No one remembers my face.

198
00:11:20,849 --> 00:11:21,849
Huh.

199
00:11:21,891 --> 00:11:25,103
You know, you could, uh, look into
getting a rebranding specialist.

200
00:11:26,604 --> 00:11:29,148
I'm afraid your case is worse
than I thought.

201
00:11:29,232 --> 00:11:33,278
I must insist we return to my room
for a more thorough examination.

202
00:11:35,154 --> 00:11:39,075
Oh, my gosh. Look at that.
No more cough!

203
00:11:40,243 --> 00:11:42,412
You're a real miracle worker, Doc.

204
00:11:42,662 --> 00:11:46,124
You should just stay here, relax,
have a drink. And I'm gonna...

205
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:48,126
Okay, bye-bye.

206
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:55,174
Ew.

207
00:12:08,605 --> 00:12:09,605
John?

208
00:12:10,064 --> 00:12:11,064
John!

209
00:12:11,316 --> 00:12:14,027
It seems we did end up
in my room, after all.

210
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:16,321
Shall we begin the examination?

211
00:12:34,672 --> 00:12:36,090
John, you killed him!

212
00:12:36,174 --> 00:12:38,760
'Course I did.
He's Jack the bloody Ripper!

213
00:12:40,386 --> 00:12:41,471
Behind you!

214
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,100
Blimey!

215
00:12:47,101 --> 00:12:48,937
Old leather apron here
must be an Encore.

216
00:12:49,604 --> 00:12:51,124
Hand me some rope now, will you, love?

217
00:12:54,359 --> 00:12:55,360
Cheers.

218
00:12:55,693 --> 00:12:59,072
Captain Lance is experiencing
unusual activity in the striatum,

219
00:12:59,155 --> 00:13:00,949
a region of the brain
that processes time.

220
00:13:01,324 --> 00:13:04,410
I'm continuing to run tests
to determine the cause.

221
00:13:04,869 --> 00:13:08,581
So, Atropos not only killed Behrad,
but also managed to put Sara in a coma.

222
00:13:08,665 --> 00:13:10,142
I don't think the team's gonna survive

223
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:11,644
another run-in
with your sister, Charlie.

224
00:13:11,668 --> 00:13:14,438
If we had it my way, we never would've
run into her in the first place.

225
00:13:14,462 --> 00:13:16,941
Pardon me, but Dr. Heywood
and Mr. Green are requesting

226
00:13:16,965 --> 00:13:18,091
your presence on the bridge.

227
00:13:18,174 --> 00:13:20,969
The Prognosticator is showing
unusual Encore activity.

228
00:13:21,052 --> 00:13:22,052
Hey.

229
00:13:23,262 --> 00:13:24,555
You got this, Captain.

230
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:26,139
Right...

231
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:28,558
"Captain."

232
00:13:32,063 --> 00:13:34,107
All the Encores are moving through time.

233
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:37,652
More specifically, they're all heading
towards a particular point.

234
00:13:37,735 --> 00:13:40,571
- Looks like they're hunting something.
- Or someone.

235
00:13:40,655 --> 00:13:42,407
Astra must have sent
the Encores after John.

236
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:44,490
Gideon, pinpoint
where and when they're converging.

237
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:46,720
See, guys? I knew all my time spent

238
00:13:46,744 --> 00:13:48,430
creating the Prognosticator
would be worth it.

239
00:13:48,454 --> 00:13:51,874
- Ava Sharpe saves the day again!
- I'm sorry, Captain.

240
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,918
It appears that
the Prognosticator is not equipped

241
00:13:54,002 --> 00:13:55,920
to handle time-traveling Encores.

242
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:58,881
Ava, take a deep breath.

243
00:13:58,965 --> 00:14:00,651
You know what, we don't even know
if Sara's gonna wake up.

244
00:14:00,675 --> 00:14:02,987
And if she does, she's going to find out
that two of the Legends are missing.

245
00:14:03,011 --> 00:14:04,429
This is beyond unacceptable.

246
00:14:04,512 --> 00:14:05,888
Let's just sit down.

247
00:14:05,972 --> 00:14:08,057
I'll bring you a cup
of your favorite herbal tea...

248
00:14:08,141 --> 00:14:09,868
I'm not just gonna sit around
and do nothing.

249
00:14:09,892 --> 00:14:11,269
If we can't track the Encores,

250
00:14:11,352 --> 00:14:13,604
we have to go after them
at the source... Astra.

251
00:14:13,688 --> 00:14:15,165
I seriously doubt she's just gonna agree

252
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:17,275
to stop doing whatever
her current evil plan is.

253
00:14:18,401 --> 00:14:20,403
That's why I'm not going
to give her a choice.

254
00:14:21,988 --> 00:14:23,197
Nighty-night, Jackie-boy.

255
00:14:23,281 --> 00:14:25,408
Sweet dreams of disembowelment
and all that jazz.

256
00:14:25,491 --> 00:14:26,868
What the hell, John?

257
00:14:27,785 --> 00:14:29,596
Astra must have sent him here
after me.

258
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,831
You know, not everything is about you.

259
00:14:31,914 --> 00:14:34,876
Well, it'd be a big, bloody coincidence
if an Encore just happened

260
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,379
to show up in the same time and place
as us for no apparent reason.

261
00:14:38,463 --> 00:14:40,715
Okay, fine. But I thought
you and Astra had a deal.

262
00:14:40,798 --> 00:14:42,717
Clearly, she got impatient, all right?

263
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,636
Yeah, I know the feeling.
Did you find the ring?

264
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:49,390
It wasn't in his room. Now something
is interfering with my magic.

265
00:14:49,891 --> 00:14:51,809
Yeah, some great sorcerer...

266
00:14:51,893 --> 00:14:53,728
Ooh, some great influencer.

267
00:14:53,811 --> 00:14:55,873
You could barely keep him
distracted for ten minutes.

268
00:14:55,897 --> 00:14:59,067
Oh, I'm sorry, should I have
let myself be serial killed,

269
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:01,736
so, you would've had five more minutes
to not find the ring?

270
00:15:02,695 --> 00:15:05,415
You know what, we should split up,
so we can both find this in peace.

271
00:15:05,531 --> 00:15:07,241
Fine by me, sweetheart.

272
00:15:14,874 --> 00:15:18,044
- Howdy, ma'am. My name's Clyde Barrow.
- And my name's Bonnie.

273
00:15:18,586 --> 00:15:20,506
And we're in need
of some accommodations.

274
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:22,965
Bloody hell. They're all Encores.

275
00:15:28,763 --> 00:15:29,907
All right. While I'm down there,

276
00:15:29,931 --> 00:15:31,891
you two need to work on
fixing the Prognosticator,

277
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:33,374
so we can track down Zari and John.

278
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:34,977
Well, tech is not really...

279
00:15:35,061 --> 00:15:36,187
Charlie!

280
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,688
Sure. We'll figure it out.

281
00:15:38,314 --> 00:15:39,914
Um, I feel like somebody has to ask you.

282
00:15:39,941 --> 00:15:42,985
Are you 100% certain
you want Gary to take you to Hell?

283
00:15:43,069 --> 00:15:44,463
I was kinda wondering the same thing.

284
00:15:44,487 --> 00:15:46,364
Look, Gary is the only wizard
I have access to.

285
00:15:46,447 --> 00:15:47,925
And besides, I'm not only
taking Gary down there.

286
00:15:47,949 --> 00:15:49,469
I'm gonna need some extra muscle, too.

287
00:15:49,534 --> 00:15:51,869
Well, thank you for noticing
the extra reps

288
00:15:51,953 --> 00:15:54,431
- I've been putting on the lat machine.
- You ready, Mick?

289
00:15:54,455 --> 00:15:55,373
- Oh.
- Mick,

290
00:15:55,374 --> 00:15:57,392
I thought you were taking
some time off to hang out with the kid.

291
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:59,544
She told me to go to Hell.
Where are we headed?

292
00:15:59,627 --> 00:16:02,588
The portal to Hell is ready, Captain.
All that's left is for...

293
00:16:03,631 --> 00:16:05,466
me to drink some of this demon blood.

294
00:16:05,925 --> 00:16:07,260
- Come on, Gary.
- Yeah.

295
00:16:09,137 --> 00:16:10,137
Ugh.

296
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:15,560
- Oh. It's actually quite tangy.
- Okay. How do we do this?

297
00:16:16,144 --> 00:16:18,784
I will say some words, and then
the sigil will transport us to Hell

298
00:16:18,813 --> 00:16:21,482
for precisely four hours.

299
00:16:21,566 --> 00:16:23,693
After that,
we'll be transported right back here.

300
00:16:23,776 --> 00:16:24,986
Sounds good to me.

301
00:16:25,695 --> 00:16:26,696
Enter.

302
00:16:35,454 --> 00:16:37,123
"Flesh become my flesh.

303
00:16:37,206 --> 00:16:39,167
Soul become my soul.

304
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,961
Hades, firstborn of Cronus and Rhea...

305
00:16:42,044 --> 00:16:43,546
I call upon you."

306
00:16:44,964 --> 00:16:46,604
All right, Mick,
get ready to light it up.

307
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:53,306
- Beer?
- Yeah.

308
00:16:55,975 --> 00:16:57,852
This was a terrible idea.

309
00:16:57,935 --> 00:16:59,854
Should have worn
shoulder pads to blend in.

310
00:16:59,937 --> 00:17:01,731
I like it. There's fire.

311
00:17:01,814 --> 00:17:03,274
Let's just find Astra.

312
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:04,817
About time we killed the bitch.

313
00:17:04,901 --> 00:17:07,778
No! John has been working so hard
to rehabilitate her.

314
00:17:07,862 --> 00:17:09,423
Also, I thought we didn't use
that word anymore.

315
00:17:09,447 --> 00:17:11,049
You know what, I'm gonna let the B-word
slide this time.

316
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:12,634
She sent a bunch of criminals
after our friends.

317
00:17:12,658 --> 00:17:14,511
How do we even find her?
What are we supposed to do,

318
00:17:14,535 --> 00:17:16,287
just ask a random demon off the streets?

319
00:17:18,956 --> 00:17:20,625
- Where's Astra?
- She's at her club.

320
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:22,919
Uh, it's two streets down, make a left.

321
00:17:23,961 --> 00:17:26,881
Wow. I didn't expect that to work.
Thanks, Micky!

322
00:17:35,848 --> 00:17:38,243
Oh, it's times like this that
I wish I hadn't given up smoking.

323
00:17:38,267 --> 00:17:40,853
Yeah, well, I wish I had brought
my own hairbrush.

324
00:17:40,937 --> 00:17:42,104
Guess we're both out of luck.

325
00:17:42,188 --> 00:17:44,065
Why would Astra send
so many Encores after me?

326
00:17:44,148 --> 00:17:46,525
I mean... seems like overkill.

327
00:17:46,817 --> 00:17:49,153
Again, maybe it's not all about you.

328
00:17:49,237 --> 00:17:50,655
What if they're after the ring?

329
00:17:51,822 --> 00:17:53,842
You know, I never told Astra
about the Loom of Fate,

330
00:17:53,866 --> 00:17:55,284
but you might be onto something.

331
00:17:56,911 --> 00:17:59,914
Oh, look at that. Suppertime!

332
00:18:00,248 --> 00:18:02,875
You're not
seriously suggesting

333
00:18:02,959 --> 00:18:04,627
we go dine with Hell-people?

334
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:07,713
I'm seriously suggesting that
you stay here, while I handle it.

335
00:18:07,797 --> 00:18:11,509
I'm part of this,
and possess far superior social skills.

336
00:18:11,592 --> 00:18:13,970
Yeah. Well, you bottled it
when Jack the Ripper attacked.

337
00:18:14,053 --> 00:18:15,429
Look, I can't look after you

338
00:18:15,513 --> 00:18:17,513
and figure out what Astra's up to
at the same time.

339
00:18:18,182 --> 00:18:20,059
This might be Behrad's totem,

340
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:22,353
but there is a little warrior me
inside here

341
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:24,563
from a different timeline,
and she's gonna protect me.

342
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:27,400
I don't even know what to say to that.

343
00:18:27,483 --> 00:18:28,776
But I will say this.

344
00:18:29,402 --> 00:18:31,988
Even if I have to tie you up myself,

345
00:18:32,071 --> 00:18:33,281
you're staying here.

346
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:43,624
What are you doing?

347
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:46,502
Well, I can't exactly go out there
as John Constantine now, can I?

348
00:18:48,796 --> 00:18:50,089
I think I have an idea.

349
00:18:52,883 --> 00:18:56,721
Clyde and I were tortured
by Manaxos the Mutilator himself.

350
00:18:56,804 --> 00:19:00,057
Your pain was a mere trifle compared
to what the Norfulthing did to me.

351
00:19:00,141 --> 00:19:03,352
And I thought the Hellhounds
were the worst evil a man could suffer.

352
00:19:03,436 --> 00:19:06,230
Who exactly are you
that you were worth Norfulthing's time?

353
00:19:06,772 --> 00:19:08,649
I am, of course, King Henry VIII,

354
00:19:08,983 --> 00:19:11,193
ruler of the British Empire.

355
00:19:11,277 --> 00:19:13,237
And what crime sent you to Hell?

356
00:19:13,738 --> 00:19:15,865
- Hmm...
- We rob banks.

357
00:19:15,948 --> 00:19:18,117
And I plunder boats.

358
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,452
You may have heard of me.

359
00:19:19,744 --> 00:19:21,495
The name's Black Caesar.

360
00:19:21,912 --> 00:19:22,830
Caesar?

361
00:19:22,831 --> 00:19:25,207
Ah, and you must be Brutus.

362
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:28,044
I always favored beheadings
over stabbing someone in the back.

363
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,337
Less cowardly.

364
00:19:30,296 --> 00:19:32,423
Supper is ready!

365
00:19:33,049 --> 00:19:35,384
Now, stop dilly-dallying
and come and have a seat,

366
00:19:35,468 --> 00:19:37,094
before the food gets cold.

367
00:19:49,023 --> 00:19:50,524
Excuse me, Miss Astra?

368
00:19:50,608 --> 00:19:52,735
I found this scum
lurking by the entrance.

369
00:19:53,361 --> 00:19:55,821
"Lurking" seems like an overly
sinister way to describe...

370
00:19:55,905 --> 00:19:57,406
Why are you here, twerp?

371
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:59,450
John Constantine is outside.

372
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:02,703
He knows you're impatient with him,
but he has the thing he promised you.

373
00:20:02,787 --> 00:20:04,681
But he doesn't want to come in here
and risk being seen.

374
00:20:04,705 --> 00:20:06,123
So, if you could take a quick break

375
00:20:06,207 --> 00:20:09,168
from eating bugs, and come with me...

376
00:20:09,251 --> 00:20:11,962
Waste my time,
and I'll let my demonic friends here

377
00:20:12,046 --> 00:20:14,423
use you as a human piñata.

378
00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:23,474
So, that's where Genghis Khan's
sword went.

379
00:20:23,557 --> 00:20:24,892
It's over, Astra.

380
00:20:24,975 --> 00:20:27,375
We know you sent your Encores
after John, so, don't play coy.

381
00:20:27,436 --> 00:20:28,476
What the hell's an Encore?

382
00:20:28,896 --> 00:20:30,582
It's what we've been calling
the corrupted souls that

383
00:20:30,606 --> 00:20:32,108
you've been sending back to Earth.

384
00:20:32,441 --> 00:20:37,029
I haven't sent a single "Encore" back
to Earth since John and I last spoke.

385
00:20:37,113 --> 00:20:38,948
- Kill her already.
- Good idea.

386
00:20:39,031 --> 00:20:40,199
Wait, Ava!

387
00:20:40,825 --> 00:20:42,410
What if she's telling the truth?

388
00:20:42,493 --> 00:20:45,329
Come inside and I'll prove it to you.

389
00:20:50,251 --> 00:20:52,962
Ah, just in time.

390
00:20:53,045 --> 00:20:54,922
Oh, I love a good carving.

391
00:20:55,005 --> 00:20:57,125
And who the devil
are you supposed to be?

392
00:20:57,174 --> 00:21:00,302
I, my friend, am Jack the Ripper.

393
00:21:00,386 --> 00:21:02,138
You've got quite the reputation, Jack.

394
00:21:02,388 --> 00:21:03,848
- Join us.
- Cheers, mate.

395
00:21:08,811 --> 00:21:10,062
My mistake, sugar.

396
00:21:10,146 --> 00:21:13,149
I would have noticed if the ring
was sitting directly in front of me.

397
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:15,734
So, we are all here for the ring.

398
00:21:16,152 --> 00:21:19,488
I don't share me treasure
with anyone but me crew.

399
00:21:19,572 --> 00:21:21,157
We've been set up.

400
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,742
I assume that we all have
the same deal, yeah?

401
00:21:23,826 --> 00:21:26,370
The ring in exchange
for free reign on Earth.

402
00:21:26,454 --> 00:21:29,623
It would appear,
we're in direct competition.

403
00:21:30,249 --> 00:21:32,376
So, then what the hell are we doing
eating dinner?

404
00:21:48,726 --> 00:21:51,061
Oh, that's a bit on the nose,
isn't it, Bruty?

405
00:21:52,313 --> 00:21:54,482
Just so we're all on the same page here,

406
00:21:54,565 --> 00:21:56,775
each one of us has a Hell weapon,

407
00:21:56,859 --> 00:22:00,154
and we could well and truly
end each other right here, right now.

408
00:22:00,446 --> 00:22:02,865
Clyde, the way I see it,
this here Jack the Ripper,

409
00:22:02,948 --> 00:22:04,241
is our greatest competition.

410
00:22:04,325 --> 00:22:06,076
Yeah, I think you're right, peaches.

411
00:22:06,619 --> 00:22:08,913
Jack here never was
caught by the police.

412
00:22:17,421 --> 00:22:18,672
Greetings, subjects.

413
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:22,843
I am your Queen, Cleopatra.

414
00:22:31,268 --> 00:22:32,728
Yes, I see.

415
00:22:33,354 --> 00:22:36,941
They're very big and impressive.

416
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:39,735
That's not what I came here for.

417
00:22:40,945 --> 00:22:43,447
Great, you all have scary weapons.
Now that we know that,

418
00:22:43,948 --> 00:22:47,576
is it really necessary for everyone
to get cramps in their arms?

419
00:22:48,577 --> 00:22:51,580
You, of course, remember Brutus?

420
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,291
Yes. Of course.

421
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:56,710
"It was not that I loved Caesar less,

422
00:22:57,336 --> 00:22:59,380
but that I loved Rome more."

423
00:23:00,548 --> 00:23:03,425
We never had
the chance of meeting before.

424
00:23:03,926 --> 00:23:07,513
But I would have thought my murder
of your lover would be unforgivable.

425
00:23:07,596 --> 00:23:10,140
Damn skippy. Kill him!

426
00:23:10,224 --> 00:23:12,893
I'm not a petty despot
ruled by past grievances.

427
00:23:12,977 --> 00:23:14,979
I'm a strategist.

428
00:23:15,062 --> 00:23:17,147
The most sensible thing to do...

429
00:23:18,065 --> 00:23:20,317
is to work together.

430
00:23:20,401 --> 00:23:22,486
As soon as one of us finds the ring,

431
00:23:22,903 --> 00:23:24,947
it's off to the pits for the rest.

432
00:23:25,531 --> 00:23:27,074
You're just gonna accept that?

433
00:23:27,533 --> 00:23:30,452
As soon as we have the ring
in our hands, we have all the power.

434
00:23:30,536 --> 00:23:34,039
We can march right into Hell
and demand our freedom!

435
00:23:34,123 --> 00:23:37,209
Hey! Hear, hear to that, eh?

436
00:23:37,293 --> 00:23:38,293
All right.

437
00:23:39,295 --> 00:23:41,589
Now, let's eat. Okay?

438
00:23:41,672 --> 00:23:42,672
Okay.

439
00:23:48,512 --> 00:23:50,139
So, where's the lughead?

440
00:23:50,222 --> 00:23:53,225
Rory is guarding our exit,
and he's enjoying some entertainment.

441
00:23:53,309 --> 00:23:56,353
Yeah, I'll definitely be seeing
that one again down here.

442
00:23:58,063 --> 00:23:59,773
Oh, you're no fun.

443
00:24:00,441 --> 00:24:02,776
Now, this is where I keep
all my soul coins.

444
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:05,738
And as you can see, they're all right...

445
00:24:08,449 --> 00:24:09,658
Did you lose something?

446
00:24:12,745 --> 00:24:15,831
No one with an "executive privacy"
button has good intentions.

447
00:24:16,749 --> 00:24:18,542
My vault is empty.

448
00:24:18,626 --> 00:24:22,755
Besides me, you're the only one
with access, Tiberius. Care to explain?

449
00:24:22,838 --> 00:24:24,256
Is this one of those human pranks?

450
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:26,508
You had me take them out
for you last week.

451
00:24:26,592 --> 00:24:27,885
Like hell I did.

452
00:24:27,968 --> 00:24:30,346
I swear it, I saw you myself.

453
00:24:31,889 --> 00:24:34,516
A shapeshifter. Damn it!

454
00:24:39,521 --> 00:24:42,524
Oh, don't look at me like that.
He'll be fine in a few hours.

455
00:24:42,858 --> 00:24:45,361
Better, even, 'cause he'll have learned
to be less gullible.

456
00:24:45,444 --> 00:24:47,571
At least
the most valuable one is still...

457
00:24:53,494 --> 00:24:55,704
Who the hell is Vandal Savage?

458
00:24:55,788 --> 00:24:58,332
- Oh, I actually know that one. He's...
- Shut up!

459
00:25:00,668 --> 00:25:02,503
I can't believe she did this to me.

460
00:25:02,586 --> 00:25:04,380
Wait. You know who stole your coins?

461
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:06,130
Yeah.

462
00:25:07,424 --> 00:25:08,634
But she is...

463
00:25:10,177 --> 00:25:12,596
too powerful for me to take on.

464
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,598
Okay. What if you had backup, you know?

465
00:25:14,682 --> 00:25:16,266
"Enemy of my enemy" sort of thing.

466
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,352
Fine.

467
00:25:18,435 --> 00:25:20,354
But this will require stealth.

468
00:25:20,437 --> 00:25:24,149
Wakey-wakey.

469
00:25:25,442 --> 00:25:26,819
The boys stay here.

470
00:25:31,532 --> 00:25:34,326
Now, that was influencing.

471
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:36,330
You really think
there's a saint's chance in Hell

472
00:25:36,412 --> 00:25:37,412
that your truce is gonna hold?

473
00:25:37,413 --> 00:25:39,873
May I remind you
that one of them is ruddy Brutus!

474
00:25:39,957 --> 00:25:41,917
Sorry, was that some weird
British-y way of saying

475
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,812
"Thank you for saving my life, Zari"?

476
00:25:43,836 --> 00:25:46,130
Yeah, okay. All right.
I was in a bit of a pickle.

477
00:25:46,213 --> 00:25:48,674
I admit it,
but may I suggest that we use

478
00:25:48,757 --> 00:25:50,342
the few minutes that you bought us

479
00:25:50,426 --> 00:25:52,052
- to go and look for the ring?
- Shh.

480
00:26:09,695 --> 00:26:11,905
Sorry about this, hon.

481
00:26:11,989 --> 00:26:13,574
Please, don't.

482
00:26:13,657 --> 00:26:15,284
Don't be scared.

483
00:26:15,367 --> 00:26:18,996
"The evil that men do lives after them,"
and all that.

484
00:26:23,667 --> 00:26:25,186
So, who's this being we're going to see?

485
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:27,296
The woman
who found me terrified and alone

486
00:26:27,379 --> 00:26:29,506
when John left me to rot down here.

487
00:26:29,673 --> 00:26:33,051
She took me in, raised me,
taught me how to make it in Hell.

488
00:26:33,135 --> 00:26:35,179
Wow. And now she's betrayed you.

489
00:26:35,262 --> 00:26:38,140
She was the one person
I thought I could trust.

490
00:26:38,223 --> 00:26:40,058
Everything I am, I owe to her.

491
00:26:41,477 --> 00:26:43,747
You know, I don't know if that is
some sob story or what, Astra,

492
00:26:43,771 --> 00:26:45,230
but I know how you feel.

493
00:26:45,314 --> 00:26:46,482
- Really?
- Yeah.

494
00:26:46,565 --> 00:26:48,066
I think it's a pretty specific story.

495
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:51,779
Yeah, well, I had a mentor once.
The guy's name was Rip.

496
00:26:51,862 --> 00:26:53,782
I trusted him with my life
until I found out that

497
00:26:53,822 --> 00:26:57,034
he fabricated all my memories
to make me good at my job.

498
00:26:57,117 --> 00:27:00,204
That's awful. So what did you do
when you found out, did you kill him?

499
00:27:00,287 --> 00:27:01,622
Ooh.

500
00:27:01,705 --> 00:27:03,207
I wanted to so bad.

501
00:27:04,374 --> 00:27:06,335
But, you know,
the one thing that I learned is...

502
00:27:06,418 --> 00:27:08,738
the only way to keep going
is to take control of your life.

503
00:27:09,004 --> 00:27:11,399
Stop letting everybody act like
they know what's best for you

504
00:27:11,423 --> 00:27:12,966
and make your own choices, you know?

505
00:27:13,926 --> 00:27:14,926
What the...

506
00:27:17,971 --> 00:27:19,556
So, it was a sob story, after all.

507
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:23,519
No, it was the truth.
Thanks for the therapy session.

508
00:27:23,602 --> 00:27:25,646
Don't have too much fun
without me, boys.

509
00:27:26,063 --> 00:27:27,356
I'll be back soon.

510
00:27:39,535 --> 00:27:42,162
Show me the treasure I seek!

511
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:48,210
That compass must have
some sort of Hell powers.

512
00:27:48,293 --> 00:27:49,670
He's using it to track the ring.

513
00:27:49,753 --> 00:27:52,631
- Okay, then we need to get the compass.
- All right. I'll grab it.

514
00:27:52,714 --> 00:27:54,466
Hey. I'm going with you.

515
00:27:56,677 --> 00:27:58,095
All right. Follow me.

516
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:15,570
Hey.

517
00:28:19,616 --> 00:28:23,287
Well, that was
bloody convenient, wasn't it?

518
00:28:29,418 --> 00:28:31,545
I tried to fight them. Just like Rory.

519
00:28:31,628 --> 00:28:33,964
You folded like
a cheap deck of cards, you bum.

520
00:28:34,172 --> 00:28:36,258
Easy.

521
00:28:36,967 --> 00:28:39,386
It's okay, Gary.
I totally got played by Astra.

522
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:44,325
On the bright side,
there's not much time left on the sigil.

523
00:28:44,349 --> 00:28:46,226
We'll pop back
to the <i>Waverider</i> soon enough.

524
00:28:46,518 --> 00:28:50,188
Um, about that...
I'm the one who cast the spell.

525
00:28:50,272 --> 00:28:52,917
So, I'll pop back to the <i>Waverider,</i>
along with anyone who's touching me

526
00:28:52,941 --> 00:28:54,401
when the time runs out.

527
00:28:55,068 --> 00:28:56,068
I'm sorry.

528
00:28:56,987 --> 00:28:59,197
- Didn't I mention that?
- No!

529
00:28:59,281 --> 00:29:01,867
Listen, you dweeb.
I gotta get out of here. I got a thing.

530
00:29:02,326 --> 00:29:03,326
What thing?

531
00:29:04,661 --> 00:29:06,204
Lita has a soccer match.

532
00:29:06,288 --> 00:29:08,790
She didn't invite me,
but I'm inviting myself.

533
00:29:08,874 --> 00:29:09,875
Sorry, Rory.

534
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:12,544
And I refuse to die here
without getting to know my daughter.

535
00:29:13,545 --> 00:29:15,088
Do we understand each other?

536
00:29:16,131 --> 00:29:18,133
- What position does she play?
- Gary.

537
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,389
Hold on,
we were here just a minute ago.

538
00:29:24,473 --> 00:29:26,224
John, we are going in circles.

539
00:29:26,308 --> 00:29:29,037
Yeah, it seems like it's not just
my magic that's wonky in this place.

540
00:29:29,061 --> 00:29:31,521
Magic or no, there's so many people
looking for this ring,

541
00:29:31,605 --> 00:29:33,023
it should've turned up by now.

542
00:29:33,106 --> 00:29:35,609
It's like
it doesn't want to be found.

543
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:39,863
Hold on a minute,
you might be onto something.

544
00:29:40,948 --> 00:29:43,700
"Sometimes you just have
to stop looking," right?

545
00:29:43,784 --> 00:29:44,952
Why would we stop looking?

546
00:29:45,035 --> 00:29:46,578
Because I'm beginning to suspect

547
00:29:46,662 --> 00:29:49,456
that the spell on the ring
is of a particular breed.

548
00:29:49,539 --> 00:29:51,667
So, if you want to find the ring...

549
00:29:52,292 --> 00:29:53,502
you can't find it.

550
00:29:56,254 --> 00:29:59,591
You've gotta hand it to Enchantress,
she is a crafty one.

551
00:29:59,675 --> 00:30:03,178
Okay, it's not just gonna
slip our minds. So, what do we do?

552
00:30:05,931 --> 00:30:07,015
We drink.

553
00:30:16,692 --> 00:30:18,402
I know what you did, Lachesis.

554
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:25,742
- Who's she?
- Astra, my dear,

555
00:30:25,826 --> 00:30:28,161
I'd like you to meet my sister, Atropos.

556
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:31,248
I've wanted you two to meet
for quite some time now.

557
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,125
Your sister?

558
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:36,420
We've worn many faces in our long lives,

559
00:30:36,503 --> 00:30:38,130
but we are family.

560
00:30:38,213 --> 00:30:40,674
Anything you need to say to me,
you can say in front of her.

561
00:30:41,508 --> 00:30:43,593
I know you stole my soul coins.

562
00:30:44,761 --> 00:30:47,514
Of course I did. I had to.

563
00:30:47,597 --> 00:30:50,225
Astra, they were becoming a distraction.

564
00:30:50,308 --> 00:30:53,687
You'd amassed all this power
for what? Parties?

565
00:30:54,146 --> 00:30:55,731
Gambling?

566
00:30:55,814 --> 00:30:59,735
- You need to think in grander terms.
- Much grander.

567
00:31:00,694 --> 00:31:03,739
You see, Astra, my sister and I...

568
00:31:04,698 --> 00:31:06,825
are two of the three Fates.

569
00:31:08,201 --> 00:31:09,911
The Loom of Fate belongs to us.

570
00:31:09,995 --> 00:31:11,496
It is our birthright.

571
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:16,168
- Why... why didn't you tell me?
- You weren't ready.

572
00:31:17,169 --> 00:31:20,005
Oh, Astra, making soul coins

573
00:31:20,088 --> 00:31:23,717
and using them to control
the denizens of Hell

574
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,720
was a cheap reflection
of my former glory.

575
00:31:27,345 --> 00:31:30,849
Now, that the Loom of Fate
is within reach...

576
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:34,352
I want you to become one of us.

577
00:31:34,436 --> 00:31:36,480
Become our third sister.

578
00:31:37,773 --> 00:31:39,858
You'd have the power of a god.

579
00:31:40,525 --> 00:31:43,570
Astra, this is what
I have been preparing you for

580
00:31:43,653 --> 00:31:45,530
ever since I took you in
as a young girl.

581
00:31:46,364 --> 00:31:48,408
But what about my mom?

582
00:31:48,742 --> 00:31:50,952
John had promised that
he'd use the Loom of Fate

583
00:31:51,036 --> 00:31:52,370
to make it so she never died.

584
00:31:52,454 --> 00:31:57,626
Astra, you need to move beyond
these petty human desires!

585
00:31:58,168 --> 00:32:02,798
I am offering you the power
to design destiny.

586
00:32:03,715 --> 00:32:05,926
You once sought to rule over Hell...

587
00:32:06,551 --> 00:32:09,513
Now, you can rule over the whole cosmos.

588
00:32:10,555 --> 00:32:12,057
Will you join us?

589
00:32:13,809 --> 00:32:15,185
What do you say, girl?

590
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,646
Trust me, Astra.
I know what's best for you.

591
00:32:17,729 --> 00:32:19,022
Sister always knows best.

592
00:32:21,608 --> 00:32:23,777
Of course, I'll join you.

593
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:26,905
How could I ever turn down
so much power?

594
00:32:26,988 --> 00:32:28,323
Good girl.

595
00:32:28,406 --> 00:32:30,450
There's just one thing.

596
00:32:31,243 --> 00:32:33,870
John Constantine's coin.

597
00:32:33,954 --> 00:32:35,455
He's mine to toy with.

598
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,333
Seems like a fair trade.

599
00:33:05,777 --> 00:33:07,004
I took care of Brutus.

600
00:33:07,028 --> 00:33:08,905
And I got our pirate friend, Caesar.

601
00:33:09,614 --> 00:33:10,699
Any luck with the ring?

602
00:33:10,782 --> 00:33:12,492
Damn thing might as well be invisible.

603
00:33:12,576 --> 00:33:15,620
Well, Bonnie, guess we got no choice
but to make the rest

604
00:33:15,704 --> 00:33:17,664
- of our fellow guests disappear.
- Mmm.

605
00:33:26,298 --> 00:33:28,842
Now, what do we have here?

606
00:33:28,925 --> 00:33:30,552
Another Hell-ian to kill?

607
00:33:30,635 --> 00:33:32,137
Lucky us.

608
00:33:33,638 --> 00:33:35,515
- I'm Jack the Ripper.
- Nice try.

609
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:36,808
We already met Jack.

610
00:33:36,892 --> 00:33:39,102
That Jack's an imposter. Worse...

611
00:33:39,561 --> 00:33:42,355
- It's John Constantine.
- That liar!

612
00:33:42,439 --> 00:33:44,039
He must be here to send us back to Hell.

613
00:33:44,107 --> 00:33:46,026
Now, don't lose your temper, Bonnie.

614
00:33:46,109 --> 00:33:48,320
We'll teach that grifter a lesson, okay?

615
00:33:52,949 --> 00:33:54,784
Good old Mrs. Hughes.

616
00:33:54,868 --> 00:33:57,370
Okay, I'm not thinking about the ring.

617
00:33:57,454 --> 00:33:59,372
I'm not thinking about the ring.

618
00:33:59,456 --> 00:34:01,082
Yeah, that's not gonna work.

619
00:34:01,166 --> 00:34:03,752
So, you're just gonna accept failure
when we are this close?

620
00:34:03,835 --> 00:34:04,961
I'm not giving up.

621
00:34:05,045 --> 00:34:07,380
Oh, I don't see it as giving up,
so much as...

622
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:10,133
accepting reality.

623
00:34:10,425 --> 00:34:11,593
I know myself.

624
00:34:12,135 --> 00:34:16,181
I'm a ripe old mix of guilt and torment.

625
00:34:16,264 --> 00:34:19,184
If the Loom of Fate offers me
even one glimmer of hope

626
00:34:19,267 --> 00:34:21,728
of redemption for all my past sins,

627
00:34:22,854 --> 00:34:24,481
particularly Astra, then...

628
00:34:26,024 --> 00:34:27,859
I'll never not be thinking about it.

629
00:34:30,362 --> 00:34:32,239
You know, it's funny,
I'm usually an expert

630
00:34:32,322 --> 00:34:34,532
at getting things out of my head.

631
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:40,747
Boyfriend cheating on me
with my assistant/best friend?

632
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:44,417
No time to cry,
I have a fall fashion line to plan.

633
00:34:45,752 --> 00:34:48,421
Overhearing my mother tell a friend
she's embarrassed

634
00:34:48,505 --> 00:34:51,049
her daughter is so shallow
and self-absorbed?

635
00:34:51,132 --> 00:34:55,679
Definitely can't process that,
I will check my Cat-Chat analytics.

636
00:35:01,977 --> 00:35:05,480
But my baby brother dying
because he was trying to protect me?

637
00:35:08,525 --> 00:35:10,944
There is nothing that can get that
out of my head.

638
00:35:16,908 --> 00:35:19,661
I was wearing the totem when he died.

639
00:35:22,414 --> 00:35:24,249
If I hadn't been, maybe he...

640
00:35:27,085 --> 00:35:28,878
Maybe he would have had a chance.

641
00:35:34,134 --> 00:35:36,261
Look, you can take it from an expert...

642
00:35:40,307 --> 00:35:43,935
Nothing good ever comes
from beating yourself up, love.

643
00:35:44,477 --> 00:35:45,854
Don't try to make me feel better.

644
00:35:50,442 --> 00:35:51,443
John.

645
00:35:52,444 --> 00:35:54,779
What if we don't find the ring?

646
00:35:54,863 --> 00:35:56,448
What if I never get him back?

647
00:35:57,407 --> 00:35:59,075
Yoo-hoo!

648
00:35:59,367 --> 00:36:02,871
- John friggin' Constantine!
- We know who you are,

649
00:36:02,954 --> 00:36:05,749
and there's someone here
you'll be just dying to meet.

650
00:36:05,832 --> 00:36:09,002
They do say imitation
is the sincerest form of flattery.

651
00:36:14,841 --> 00:36:17,510
This passage leads outside.
I'll distract them while you escape.

652
00:36:18,136 --> 00:36:19,846
- No, come with me.
- Go.

653
00:36:20,221 --> 00:36:23,183
This is my house
and I'm just crazy enough to defend it.

654
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,768
And listen...

655
00:36:24,851 --> 00:36:26,478
you can get Behrad back, Zari.

656
00:36:26,561 --> 00:36:28,831
I truly believe that. But unless
you get out of here right now,

657
00:36:28,855 --> 00:36:30,648
then neither of you stand a chance.

658
00:36:32,901 --> 00:36:33,902
Okay.

659
00:36:54,506 --> 00:36:58,218
Ava, I'd just like to say,
you're the best boss I've ever had.

660
00:36:58,885 --> 00:37:00,553
Well, the only boss I've ever had.

661
00:37:00,637 --> 00:37:03,723
I'm more apprentice
than employee with John.

662
00:37:03,807 --> 00:37:05,100
And before the Bureau, well...

663
00:37:05,225 --> 00:37:08,144
Ah! Finally, you've come to kill us.

664
00:37:08,686 --> 00:37:10,939
About time. I was getting bored!

665
00:37:16,027 --> 00:37:17,070
Get out of here.

666
00:37:18,446 --> 00:37:19,966
Astra, what made you change your mind?

667
00:37:20,031 --> 00:37:21,631
You're helping John
find the Loom for me.

668
00:37:21,658 --> 00:37:22,909
Might as well let you.

669
00:37:22,992 --> 00:37:25,495
Either he'll come through,
or Lachesis is bound to.

670
00:37:25,578 --> 00:37:27,789
Did you say "Lachesis"? The Fate?

671
00:37:28,498 --> 00:37:29,833
Wait, how do you know who...

672
00:37:29,916 --> 00:37:31,501
It's a small underworld after all.

673
00:37:31,584 --> 00:37:33,336
- Time's almost up!
- Come with us.

674
00:37:34,003 --> 00:37:34,921
- What?
- What?

675
00:37:34,922 --> 00:37:36,690
Astra, it's time
for you to take control.

676
00:37:36,714 --> 00:37:37,714
Don't wait for them.

677
00:37:37,757 --> 00:37:40,027
You can help us find the Loom
and save your mother yourself.

678
00:37:40,051 --> 00:37:41,136
Ten seconds left!

679
00:37:42,387 --> 00:37:43,388
The choice is yours.

680
00:37:46,266 --> 00:37:49,144
Wait, did she ever channel an animal
while you were, you know...

681
00:37:49,644 --> 00:37:50,644
She did once.

682
00:37:50,687 --> 00:37:51,688
But it was...

683
00:37:56,317 --> 00:37:57,986
- Is that...
- Meet Astra.

684
00:37:58,403 --> 00:37:59,529
Why does she have the sword?

685
00:37:59,612 --> 00:38:01,292
There's no time to explain.
We got to move.

686
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,911
Where's the ring, John?

687
00:38:06,995 --> 00:38:08,663
I don't know where the ring is.

688
00:38:08,746 --> 00:38:11,291
And even if I did,
I wouldn't tell you muppets.

689
00:38:11,374 --> 00:38:13,751
John. John, be reasonable.

690
00:38:13,835 --> 00:38:15,795
We are going to kill you, regardless.

691
00:38:15,879 --> 00:38:18,840
But it's up to you
how painful that death has to be.

692
00:38:19,842 --> 00:38:22,344
You'd be surprised how long
you can stay alive without...

693
00:38:23,511 --> 00:38:24,511
certain organs.

694
00:38:28,057 --> 00:38:30,018
- You want your coat back, don't ya?
- Mm.

695
00:38:30,101 --> 00:38:31,936
You can all go to Hell!

696
00:38:33,396 --> 00:38:34,396
Hmm.

697
00:38:37,525 --> 00:38:38,735
Stop!

698
00:38:40,528 --> 00:38:41,528
Cleopatra?

699
00:38:42,363 --> 00:38:43,490
Yes.

700
00:38:43,573 --> 00:38:45,408
I order you to stop.

701
00:38:45,492 --> 00:38:47,219
You don't have
that kind of power here, honey.

702
00:38:47,243 --> 00:38:49,204
Are you both serious? She's with him!

703
00:38:49,287 --> 00:38:50,747
Is that so?

704
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:52,373
Maybe this will make you talk.

705
00:38:52,457 --> 00:38:54,250
I don't know
where the ring is, all right?

706
00:38:54,667 --> 00:38:57,879
Funny, I believe you. What a shame.

707
00:38:58,588 --> 00:39:01,799
- Cheer up, darlin'. We can kill him now.
- Mmm.

708
00:39:01,883 --> 00:39:03,593
No!

709
00:39:13,853 --> 00:39:14,854
You come back...

710
00:39:43,633 --> 00:39:46,135
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

711
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:52,642
Blimey.

712
00:39:54,852 --> 00:39:55,852
What?

713
00:39:56,521 --> 00:39:58,022
The bloody ring.

714
00:40:04,279 --> 00:40:06,656
Must have been here
the whole time.

715
00:40:07,156 --> 00:40:09,284
I guess I stopped thinking about it.

716
00:40:12,495 --> 00:40:14,455
Guys! We're here to save you!

717
00:40:15,081 --> 00:40:16,165
But, uh...

718
00:40:17,333 --> 00:40:19,669
it looks like you took care of that
on your own.

719
00:40:19,752 --> 00:40:21,605
Thank God. Please tell me
that you found the ring?

720
00:40:21,629 --> 00:40:24,632
We did. Thanks to Zari.

721
00:40:24,841 --> 00:40:27,093
- Fantastic.
- Good.

722
00:40:27,176 --> 00:40:29,178
Wait a second.
Are those Hell weapons?

723
00:40:29,262 --> 00:40:30,262
Yeah.

724
00:40:30,263 --> 00:40:31,931
We could use those, especially...

725
00:40:32,015 --> 00:40:33,815
Yeah, let's just get them
and get out of here.

726
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:36,352
Good morning!

727
00:40:36,436 --> 00:40:38,187
Are those even more guests?

728
00:40:38,313 --> 00:40:41,608
Oh! Um, no.
So sorry, ma'am, we were just leaving.

729
00:40:46,446 --> 00:40:47,614
And, uh...

730
00:40:48,197 --> 00:40:50,658
here's me thinking
you weren't allowed to meddle anymore.

731
00:40:51,576 --> 00:40:53,369
You could've been a touch more direct.

732
00:40:53,453 --> 00:40:55,622
I'm sure I don't know what you mean.

733
00:40:56,289 --> 00:40:58,750
Yeah. Right.

734
00:41:05,089 --> 00:41:07,842
See you around, John Constantine.

735
00:41:11,846 --> 00:41:13,514
So, you got the totem to work?

736
00:41:13,598 --> 00:41:15,433
Yeah, I did. It was amazing.

737
00:41:15,516 --> 00:41:17,310
Terrifying, but amazing.

738
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:21,230
And I sort of felt like
Behrad was there with me.

739
00:41:21,731 --> 00:41:25,068
He'd be so proud of you.
I'm so proud of you. Congratulations.

740
00:41:26,527 --> 00:41:27,445
John!

741
00:41:27,446 --> 00:41:28,572
You're safe!

742
00:41:28,655 --> 00:41:31,699
All right, Gary. Oh! Okay, all right.
Calm down, all right?

743
00:41:31,783 --> 00:41:33,326
I'm happy to see you, too, mate.

744
00:41:33,409 --> 00:41:34,619
Hey, how's Sara doing?

745
00:41:35,286 --> 00:41:37,830
Oh, she's still unconscious.
Charlie is sitting with her now.

746
00:41:37,914 --> 00:41:40,958
I'm gonna try to distract myself
by fixing the Prognosticator.

747
00:41:41,125 --> 00:41:42,728
Technical skills aren't
Charlie and I's strong suit.

748
00:41:42,752 --> 00:41:45,296
- I know.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on a tick.

749
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:48,007
If that contraption is broke,
how the hell did you find us?

750
00:41:48,091 --> 00:41:49,842
Uh, about that...

751
00:41:50,218 --> 00:41:51,469
Hey, John.

752
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:56,683
I hear we have a Loom to build.
