1
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:24,733
NYSSA:
Oliver Queen is still alive.

2
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,528
Somehow Ta-er al-Sahfer's killer
still yet breathes.

3
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:30,989
RA'S AL GHUL:
Yes, I know.

4
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:33,325
He has returned to Starling City, apparently.

5
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:35,369
Why did you not tell me?

6
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:38,247
I had a right to know
that justice has not been done.

7
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:40,791
Because Oliver Queen
did not murder Ta-er al-Sahfer.

8
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:45,212
Do you not believe his own confession
because you doubt his motives?

9
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:48,006
Or because you don't approve of my grief?

10
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:51,134
-Sara was your beloved.
-And you've never approved.

11
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:55,013
I knew Sara would leave us, leave you...

12
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:57,432
...one way or the other.

13
00:00:57,599 --> 00:01:01,687
I didn't approve of the love that I knew
would end only in heartbreak.

14
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:05,107
Whether Queen killed Sara or not...

15
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:09,194
...he challenged you, he defied you.

16
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:12,155
For that alone, he must die.

17
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,795
Coordinate your attacks.

18
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:30,424
If you don't fight in unison,
your numbers become my advantage.

19
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:39,308
You both have a long way to go.

20
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:41,977
Particularly you, Oliver.

21
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:46,148
You've spent years preparing
to bring a bow and arrow to a swordfight.

22
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:50,193
That's almost funny coming from you.
You're the reason the League is targeting us.

23
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,654
Thea has the club closed for renovations.

24
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:56,033
I've reinforced all the entrances
with A.R.G.U.S. tech. We're secure.

25
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:59,828
-John.
-My friends call me Dig.

26
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:02,039
You shouldn't even speak to me.

27
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:10,422
If the club is secure as Dig says,
perhaps you and Thea should relocate here.

28
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:13,592
We discussed that.
Thea wants to stay in the loft.

29
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:16,178
I have been able to survive
in Starling City...

30
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:19,097
...because the League has no idea
where in the city I am.

31
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:20,807
We are not leaving the loft.

32
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,352
You and your sister
have the same stubbornness.

33
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:26,563
Clearly it comes from
your mother's side of the family.

34
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:32,152
It's pretty amazing how much Malcolm
taught you in such a short time.

35
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,448
Yeah. He's father of the year.

36
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:39,076
Your fighting style, it...

37
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:40,911
It reminds me a bit of Sara.

38
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:47,751
That's probably because the same people
taught Malcolm and her to fight.

39
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:50,462
I need to take a shower.

40
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,514
What?

41
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:04,183
I was gonna ask for a favor,
but I'm really more concerned...

42
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,603
-...about you at the moment, Oliver.
-I'm fine.

43
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:11,483
You've been pushing it hard
with Malcolm lately.

44
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:15,612
-When's the last time you got a decent sleep?
-I will sleep when this is over.

45
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:28,083
We recovered the Omega
from Chien Naa Wei.

46
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:32,295
We stole the Alpha from the Hong Kong
military and gave it to Amanda Waller.

47
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:36,633
Look, no matter how many times you make
me say it, it's not gonna be any less true.

48
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:40,011
-That's enough. You're relieved.
SOLDIER: Yes, sir.

49
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,889
Sorry. Waller's a little too thorough
for her own good.

50
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,517
And by "thorough,"
I think you know I mean paranoid.

51
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:48,061
Well, I've gotten used to it by now.

52
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:49,938
Where is she, anyway?

53
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:53,442
Well, the mop-up of the Alpha-Omega
bioweapons problem...

54
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,694
...has become a United States Army
operation.

55
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:58,822
Ms. Waller's participation is concluded.

56
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:01,408
I'm sure that comes
as a profound disappointment.

57
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,243
Oh, like you wouldn't believe.

58
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:07,205
I apologize for the invasiveness
of your debrief.

59
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:10,083
And now that it's over, you're free to go.

60
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:14,004
The Yamashiros have been released too.
They're returning to Japan.

61
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:17,132
You go with them, and from there
you can return to Starling...

62
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:20,218
...or go wherever else on earth you wish.

63
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:22,345
Thank you, General Shrieve.

64
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,556
After what you did, son...

65
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,059
...that's the least I can do.

66
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:43,283
This is hardcore.

67
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:46,036
When Dig said he was fortifying the club...

68
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:49,247
...I figured there'd just be
a few extra locks and cameras. Heh.

69
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:54,878
-Are you okay?
-No, no.

70
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:57,339
-Not really.
-What's wrong?

71
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:00,675
Ollie told me that I can't tell anyone.

72
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:05,430
Whatever it is, you have to be able
to talk about it with someone.

73
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:07,891
Someone who's not your brother.

74
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,896
I killed Sara.

75
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,234
-It was Malcolm, he...
-I know.

76
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:20,237
And none of you told me?

77
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:23,824
You know last year when I kind of
went off the rails for a bit?

78
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,827
-Yeah.
-I was also under the influence of something.

79
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:31,122
And just like you, I killed someone.

80
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:33,250
A cop.

81
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,585
-Roy...
-They didn't tell me either.

82
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:39,923
-And when I found out...
-You wished that you didn't know.

83
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,093
I'm not gonna lie and tell you
that the feeling ever goes away...

84
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,762
...but I can tell you that it gets easier, Thea.

85
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:52,644
You don't have to see that cop's family
almost every single day.

86
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:55,564
I can't imagine
that it's gonna get any easier.

87
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:59,484
And I don't think that it should.

88
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:05,574
[BELLS CHIME]

89
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,877
So he is alive. There were doubts.

90
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:21,172
Any idea what happens to the stock of Palmer
Technologies when Palmer goes missing...

91
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,091
...for a week?

92
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:26,303
Whoa.

93
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,387
It's been a week?

94
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:30,891
I've been a little distracted.

95
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:34,227
Can't get the modulator
to interface with the system.

96
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:36,730
-I've been working the problem but...
-Stop.

97
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:40,650
I imagined you'd say that. This is the step
toward the suit becoming operational.

98
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,945
-A little facial hair is a small price to pay...
-Stop.

99
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:49,034
This is a subsonic ionizer. If you try to use
it on quad-band circuitry, it could result...

100
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,747
In a catalytic reaction that could destroy
the entire building. Oops.

101
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:58,168
You need to get some sleep.

102
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:01,296
-I will once I've cracked the problem.
-Or blow yourself up.

103
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:03,548
-Whichever comes first.
-Ray.

104
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:07,218
When those men killed Anna...

105
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:11,097
...I promised myself I would never
feel that helpless again.

106
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:15,602
So can you imagine how I felt when Brick's
men took a portion of the city hostage?

107
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:18,146
Lousy. We all did.

108
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:22,275
-But if you're punishing yourself...
-I'm not punishing myself.

109
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,611
I'm focused on the task at hand.

110
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,155
Too focused, clearly.

111
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:30,325
I'm sorry, but I've got a lot of work to do.

112
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,673
Hey, Dad, it's me again.

113
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:48,426
Listen, I know you're upset,
and you have every right to be...

114
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:53,264
...but it's been over a week,
and now that you know the truth...

115
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:58,645
...neither of us should go through
this alone, so please call me back.

116
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,438
I love you.

117
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:07,320
Hey. What are you doing here?

118
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,948
I need to talk to you.

119
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,617
-Is everything all right?
-No.

120
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:14,744
It's about Sara.

121
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,998
Okay.

122
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:22,377
Malcolm drugged me.

123
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:25,880
He gave me something...

124
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:31,845
...that made me susceptible
to suggestion, and I...

125
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,555
Thea...

126
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:35,640
...what are you talking about?

127
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,893
I killed Sara.

128
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:43,273
I didn't know what I was doing, okay?

129
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,566
It wasn't me.

130
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,444
I'm so sorry, Laurel.

131
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,947
If Merlyn drugged you...

132
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,659
...then it wasn't your fault.

133
00:08:57,203 --> 00:09:01,166
But how could you work with him?
How could you stand by his side?

134
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,918
Because of the threat of the League.

135
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,212
We have to work with him.

136
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:08,798
I don't have a choice.

137
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:11,342
Yes, you do.

138
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,722
What happened wasn't your fault, Thea,
because it wasn't your decision.

139
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:20,185
If you want to make this right,
what you do from now on...

140
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:22,604
...that is.

141
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:40,288
I can't remember Sara's smile.
It's weird, isn't it?

142
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:46,961
I mean, I know Sara used
to smile and laugh, but...

143
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:49,798
But when I close my eyes
and I try and picture it...

144
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:52,801
...all I see is the way that I found her.

145
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,721
Sometimes the only thing
that keeps me going...

146
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:59,432
...is the thought
of one day finding her killer.

147
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,934
We will.

148
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,561
I promise.

149
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,484
How do you do that?

150
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:12,946
-Do what?
-Lie.

151
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:14,489
Right to my face.

152
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:18,952
Thea told me, Oliver.
She told me everything.

153
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:21,371
How could you keep this from me?

154
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:24,582
After what you wanted to do
to Lacroix and Merlyn...

155
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,918
...do you really need to ask me
that question?

156

You have two options, Ray.

310
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:44,386
Option one: You can find a way to break
the encryption I used to lock up your server...

311
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:50,684
...which by my calculations
will take you roughly 6.25 hours.

312
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:57,900
Or you can use that time
to eat a proper meal, take a shower...

313
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:00,277
...and get no less than five hours of sleep...

314
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:04,156
...at the completion of which
I will give you the password.

316

It's your choice,
but I highly recommend option two...

317
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:12,581
...because this whole situation
has gone from endearingly eccentric...

318
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:15,709
...to creepily not okay.

319
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:20,172
If I had the energy
I think I'd be getting angry right now...

320
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,091
...but instead I'll just take option two.

321
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:24,093
That's a wise choice.

322
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:29,807
After your dinner and a shower,
I am taking you straight to bed.

323

change the way you view the entire world?

329

What did Oliver say?

330

Did you ask him?

331

-Oliver has other things on his mind.
-Like what?

332

He's going to Nanda Parbat.

333

Cheating death once
wasn't enough for him?

334
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:11,807
Well, he's convinced
he's doing the right thing.

335
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,727

337

Oliver has to do what's right by his family.
I have to do what's right by mine.

338

340

you blamed yourself.

And the only reason you think
you can live with Malcolm's death...

359

...and he was dazzling,
magnificent, powerful.

And then, nearly half a century later,
I stumbled upon this man again.

He was withered...

Please don't do this.

383
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:25,375
There is a price you must pay
for your crimes...

384
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:28,837
...that can only be measured
in agony and blood.

385

But know I will take no pleasure in this.

To do that
you have to be in a certain mindset.
