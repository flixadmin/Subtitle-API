BARRY: My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:10,220
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

3
00:00:10,384 --> 00:00:13,058
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

4
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:16,100
I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.

5
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:18,772
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

6
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:21,905
but in doing so,
I opened up our world to new threats.

7
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:25,405
And I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

8
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:27,614
I am the Flash.

is the Speed Force.

00:00:32,865 --> 00:00:35,039
Your past, your present, your future.

12
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:38,421
- Say, Iris, you look amazing.
- Thanks, Tony.

13
00:00:38,704 --> 00:00:41,457
His skin changed. lt turned to metal.

14
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:44,548
Tony might have been a bully,
but he didn't deserve to die.

15
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,301
Barry, you've always had
someone to come home to.

16
00:00:47,463 --> 00:00:50,262
I can't help but wonder, maybe,
we were meant to be together.

17
00:00:50,424 --> 00:00:53,395
- You lost your powers?
- I gave them up to save Wally.

18
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:56,932
I can recreate the circumstances
to get you your speed back.

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,656
I didn't...

24
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:14,658
I'm so sorry.

25
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:16,867
We lost him.

No, no, no.

27
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,879
He could've gotten knocked somewhere,

28
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:22,623
or maybe even run there.

No, the Breach Room
was designed to be sealed off.

All right, look, if it's me that he wants,

485
00:29:19,715 --> 00:29:21,343
- I'll just lead him away.
- No, you won't.

and still wants you,

he's gonna let you go now?

you'll give me your answer.

642
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:40,856
If you're still here,
I'll know you've chosen to stay with me.

643
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:43,072
But if you're not here,

644
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:47,027
I'll know you've chosen
your friends instead.

645
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:52,000
And I will show you exactly as much mercy

646
00:40:52,157 --> 00:40:55,503
as I will show them
when we next see each other.

647
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:59,248
So, there you have it.

648
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:02,338
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

649
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,382
I need to go.

650
00:41:18,101 --> 00:41:20,820
(DISTORTED) My brothers and sisters.

651
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,981
My friends.

652
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:28,364
I've brought us to this new world,

653
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:32,077
which lay before us defenseless,

654
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:34,626
ours for the taking.

655
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:40,878
The humans think
that this planet belongs to them.

656
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:45,295
- Whose world is this?
- ALL: (CHANTING) Our world!
