1
00:00:02,869 --> 00:00:04,236
Jade: Help!

2
00:00:04,238 --> 00:00:06,805
Jackie, can't hang on!

3
00:00:06,807 --> 00:00:10,609
Need...Food.

4
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:13,278
You are not starving
to death, Jade.

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,081
You could have
some of uncle's
mung beans.

6
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,518
I'll never be <i> that</i> hungry.

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,588
Unh! Tohru went to get
dinner forever ago.

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,824
What, did he get attacked
by ninjas or something?

9
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:35,334
(Chanting)

10
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:49,048
(Chanting)

11
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:53,052
(Gasps)

12
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:46,705
(Chanting)

13
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:53,912
(Tohru roars)

14
00:01:53,914 --> 00:01:56,081
Ayah!

15
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:58,984
Tohru, no! He is
a holy man!

16
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:03,689
(Whimpers)

17
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:10,262
Heh. Welcome
to uncle's rare finds.

18
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:21,140
Kindly forgive the brutish
behavior of my apprentice.

19
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:25,677
He offers you his meal
as an apology.

20
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,747
(Slurping)

21
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:32,251
Ooh, we would never
eat <i> his</i> food.

22
00:02:32,253 --> 00:02:34,253
You do not like mushu?

23
00:02:34,255 --> 00:02:36,788
We monks
of the Ben shui order

24
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,891
have followed signs
and omens

25
00:02:38,893 --> 00:02:41,760
to this place in search
of the chosen one.

26
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:44,730
Haven't seen him.
You?

27
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:46,498
Wha...
- Hey!

28
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,835
Accept this offering,
o chosen one.

29
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,039
But he can't be
your leader.

30
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:55,874
He's our tohru.

31
00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:59,444
The chosen one has lived
a thousand lifetimes.

32
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:01,580
When one life
has run its course,

33
00:03:01,582 --> 00:03:04,283
the chosen one's
life energy--his chi--

34
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,986
returns in a new vessel.

35
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:09,788
That's why tohru's
so big.

36
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,323
All that extra chi.

37
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:14,793
Why did you not tell me you
were a leader of holy men?

38
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:16,195
I did not know.

39
00:03:16,197 --> 00:03:18,964
No doubt it is due
to my good influence.

40
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:21,967
Come.
We must journey

41
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:23,569
to our temple
in Bhutan,

42
00:03:23,571 --> 00:03:24,970
where
the high mystic

43
00:03:24,972 --> 00:03:27,072
will awaken
your chi.

44
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:29,074
You're leaving now?

45
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:30,576
The chosen one's chi

46
00:03:30,578 --> 00:03:32,744
is vulnerable
while it sleeps.

47
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:36,481
If the dark forces were
to destroy him now--

48
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:37,983
destroy?

49
00:03:37,985 --> 00:03:39,518
Let 'em try.

50
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,687
Big t can take care
of himself.

51
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:43,322
(All gasp)
Oh, no, no, no.

52
00:03:43,324 --> 00:03:45,824
The chosen one
is a being of peace,

53
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:47,526
not of war.

54
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:49,428
It is foretold
that a champion

55
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,464
will come forward
to defend him.

56
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,033
Huh?

57
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,070
Uh, so, uh,

58
00:03:58,072 --> 00:04:00,939
what sort of dark forces
are we talking about?

59
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:20,292
The Ben shui have located
the chosen one.

60
00:04:20,294 --> 00:04:23,028
I, tao LAN wong,
cannot allow

61
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,830
his chi to be awakened,

62
00:04:24,832 --> 00:04:27,399
for evil must prevail.

63
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:30,636
Dark chi must reign!

64
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:35,641
Gon! Chui! Ran!

65
00:04:35,643 --> 00:04:38,543
Seek out the chosen one
and annihilate him!

66
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,640
All: Ohh!

67
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:11,810
The chosen one
is a river
of enlightenment,

68
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,679
not a beast
of burden.

69
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:17,883
Ahh.

70
00:05:17,885 --> 00:05:20,018
The champion
will serve.

71
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,820
Huh? Unh! Uhh! Oof!

72
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:25,390
Behold, chosen one...
- But--

73
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:27,392
your sacred garments.

74
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:30,395
Silk. Very chic.

75
00:05:30,397 --> 00:05:32,864
I am losing
my assistant
shopkeeper.

76
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:35,534
Jackie will just
have to help more
around the shop.

77
00:05:35,536 --> 00:05:38,537
Come, you will
both serve
- the chosen one well.

78
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:40,439
Uh, serve?

79
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,149
Really, this is
not necessary.

80
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:53,719
Ohh! The chosen
one's glory

81
00:05:53,721 --> 00:05:57,089
must be celebrated,
not concealed.

82
00:05:57,091 --> 00:05:59,791
Tch! So those dark forces
can find him?

83
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,895
Unh! Ohh! Argh!

84
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:06,531
Rise, champion.

85
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:09,101
Our temple is still
many miles away.

86
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:11,002
(Yawns)

87
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:14,139
Ohh! The chosen one
requires rest.

88
00:06:14,141 --> 00:06:16,241
We will stop
for the night.

89
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:17,776
Grr.

90
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,782
Uncle is too old
for this.

91
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:25,851
Tch! I'm too old
for this.

92
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:29,988
Let's just try to make
the best of--oh!

93
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,059
When the chosen one
sleeps well,

94
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:36,194
everyone is rested.

95
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:38,130
(All grumbling)

96
00:06:38,132 --> 00:06:40,065
(Snoring and wheezing)

97
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,136
Ohh.

98
00:06:44,138 --> 00:06:47,939
Ooh...Tohru,
uncle has the willies.

99
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:49,274
Willies?

100
00:06:49,276 --> 00:06:51,209
Dark chi must be near.

101
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:53,145
How near?

102
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:04,523
Ohh!

103
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:10,495
Whoa! Freaky eyes.

104
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:12,397
A dark chi warrior!

105
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:15,567
Chi master fung warned me
of such dark entities.

106
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:24,743
Uh-uh-uh!

107
00:07:24,745 --> 00:07:27,245
The chosen one is
a being of peace.

108
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:29,147
Ohh.

109
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:35,320
Pillow fight--unh!

110
00:07:35,322 --> 00:07:37,055
You are too young
to wage battle

111
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:38,924
with the forces
of darkness!

112
00:07:38,926 --> 00:07:40,058
Aww!

113
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,644
One more thing...

114
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:02,547
Both warrior and weapon
share the same dark chi.

115
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:04,416
They function as one.

116
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:07,352
How nice for them.

117
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:17,696
Gone! Jackie,
you smoked him!

118
00:08:17,698 --> 00:08:20,198
This was
but a test.

119
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,400
And Jackie
aced it, right?

120
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:24,035
Hmm, let us say

121
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:26,905
more extreme
challenges lie ahead.

122
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:28,106
Tohru:
Not anymore.

123
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:29,774
We are
going home.

124
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:31,309
I do not
want anyone
to be hurt

125
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:32,844
on my behalf.

126
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:35,113
Ohh! Such selflessness

127
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:37,382
in the face of danger!

128
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:39,417
There can be no doubt.

129
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,653
He <i> is</i> the chosen one!

130
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:43,655
Auughh.

131
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,330
Jade: Are we there yet?

132
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:56,635
Are we there yet?

133
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,140
Patience.

134
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:04,609
Before the chosen one
reaches our temple,

135
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:06,878
he must greet
his worshippers.

136
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:08,680
Worshippers?

137
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:10,215
Man: It's
the chosen one!

138
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:11,650
Woman: Look,
it's him!

139
00:09:11,652 --> 00:09:13,351
(All calling out)

140
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:18,557
W-what do they want?

141
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:20,492
To bask in your glory.

142
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:24,162
Villagers, chanting:
Chosen one!

143
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:25,964
Chosen one!

144
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:27,399
Chosen one!

145
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:32,804
Ohh! Where did he go?

146
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:35,206
Ohh! The chosen one
has vanished!

147
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:37,075
Tohru!

148
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,610
Ow!

149
00:09:38,612 --> 00:09:40,512
You are
a lousy champion!

150
00:09:40,514 --> 00:09:43,248
You let the chosen one
out of your sight!

151
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,983
We must find him.

152
00:09:44,985 --> 00:09:48,053
Who knows
- what the dark forces
intend to do?

153
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:52,223
Tohru? Tohruuu!

154
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,727
Big t, where are you?

155
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:02,734
Dark forces, huh?

156
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,302
Ahem!

157
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:08,640
(Imitating monk)
The chosen one is
a cleanser of souls,

158
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:10,442
not a washer
of dishes.

159
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:14,279
(Sighs) But I do not <i> want</i>
to be the chosen one.

160
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:17,515
Tch! Why not?
You have your own
personal champion

161
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:19,784
and servants
who wait on you
hand and foot.

162
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:23,321
I am not accustomed
to such treatment, Jade.

163
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:25,123
I enjoy serving people,

164
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,359
especially those I like.

165
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:29,194
Well, maybe
washing dishes

166
00:10:29,196 --> 00:10:30,795
isn't the only way
to help.

167
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:33,298
Did you see
how happy you made
those villagers?

168
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,467
The chosen one
serves, too,

169
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:37,669
in a...Different
kind of way.

170
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:40,105
Ohh, perhaps you are right.

171
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:41,673
Good, 'cause you
missed a spot.

172
00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:43,375
You are <i> so</i> fired.

173
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:48,880
Jackie? Uncle?
I've found--

174
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:52,984
trouble.

175
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,426
Dark chi guy brought
some freaky-eyed friends.

176
00:11:01,428 --> 00:11:03,028
Let's take 'em.

177
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,830
But the chosen one is
not allowed to fight.

178
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,699
Eh! Nobody's lookin'.

179
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:10,902
Ohh!

180
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:24,849
Wah!

181
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:25,984
Bah!

182
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:32,223
Hyah!

183
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:36,161
You are still
too young!

184
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:37,395
Ohh...

185
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:50,375
Chopped salad.

186
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:03,588
You're fixing a snack?

187
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,223
How can uncle
cast a chi spell

188
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,125
without
the ingredients?

189
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:12,130
Ooh, you better
get cooking!

190
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,233
Huh!

191
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:23,908
Daaaah!

192
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:25,376
Huh?

193
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:26,978
(Both chanting)

194
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:41,192
Ohh.

195
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:43,595
We really smoked 'em
this time. Right, uncle?

196
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:46,364
My disappearing spell
is only temporary.

197
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:54,105
Our temple is near.

198
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,740
The chosen one
will be safe

199
00:12:55,742 --> 00:12:58,343
once the high mystic
awakens his chi.

200
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:07,552
So, a champion is not
enough for the chosen one.

201
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:11,422
He brings his own
chi wizard as well.

202
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:13,792
Then it will take
a chi wizard

203
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:15,660
to beat a chi wizard.

204
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:24,169
Do not worry,
champion.

205
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:26,805
Good chi protects
our temple.

206
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:29,774
The dark entities
cannot enter from outside.

207
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,479
Greetings, friend.

208
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:37,248
Are you prepared
to accept your destiny?

209
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:42,387
(Chanting)
Chosen one. Chosen one.

210
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:46,658
I am.

211
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,460
Then let us begin
the awakening ceremony.

212
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:55,533
Ah...Mmm...

213
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:57,936
When you awaken
from this trance,

214
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,774
your chi will
awaken as well.

215
00:14:02,776 --> 00:14:05,577
You will remember
your thousand lifetimes

216
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:08,880
and lead us once again.

217
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:11,115
(Chanting)

218
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:16,855
(All chanting)

219
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,101
(Chanting)

220
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:35,306
Ooh, the willies.

221
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:39,444
(Gasps)

222
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:40,979
The dark warriors!

223
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:42,380
But I thought
the dark entities

224
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,015
could not enter
from outside.

225
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:45,583
A dark chi trick.

226
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:47,485
They were summoned
from <i> within</i> the temple.

227
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:49,721
If the dark ones
destroy the vessel,

228
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:52,857
the chosen one's chi
will be lost forever!

229
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:55,159
(Gasps) And we'll
lose tohru forever.

230
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:57,128
Destroy the chosen one!

231
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:04,636
Unh! Ha! Unh! Ha!

232
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:10,942
Step aside, wizard!

233
00:15:10,944 --> 00:15:13,344
Your tepid spells
cannot stop me.

234
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:16,614
Be warned.

235
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:19,117
I was a student
of chi master fung.

236
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:22,153
And I am tao LAN wong,

237
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:26,057
the dark master
who defeated fung.

238
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:28,326
(Gasps)
You will pay for that!

239
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:36,935
(Chants)

240
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:41,572
Hyah! Nyuh! Uhh!

241
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:45,910
Mine!

242
00:15:45,912 --> 00:15:47,145
Yours.

243
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,547
(All chant)

244
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:13,771
Ooh...

245
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:15,773
How did you do that?

246
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:17,875
Master fung
taught me well.

247
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:39,163
How long is this ritual?!

248
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:42,600
This walking stick belonged
to the previous chosen one,

249
00:16:42,602 --> 00:16:45,470
the yak Shepherd chop yep.
It will help you.

250
00:16:45,472 --> 00:16:46,604
How?

251
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:48,773
It is full
of his good chi.

252
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:51,809
Use your chi
to control it.

253
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:53,611
How?!

254
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:55,446
Heh. I have a stick.

255
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:58,016
Doh! Uhh! Oh! Ooh!

256
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,420
A very good stick.

257
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,993
If it works for them...

258
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:11,796
Yes!

259
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:13,765
No! Ohh!

260
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,367
(Gasps)

261
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:18,102
Stop!

262
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:21,039
Whoa.

263
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:24,075
Waah! Hyah!

264
00:17:24,077 --> 00:17:25,243
Cool.

265
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,317
There goes my chi.

266
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:36,020
No! Leave him alone!

267
00:17:36,022 --> 00:17:37,488
(Chanting)

268
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:38,623
Huh?

269
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,162
No.

270
00:17:44,164 --> 00:17:46,097
(Grunts)

271
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:49,233
The awakening is complete,
great leader.

272
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,636
Your memories
have been restored.

273
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:53,538
They have?

274
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,507
You do not remember
your thousand lifetimes?

275
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:00,078
Mm-mmm.

276
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:07,118
Not even your once trusty
walking stick

277
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,220
or your most favorite yak?

278
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:13,324
Mmm...I am sorry.

279
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:15,393
No.

280
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:20,531
He is not the chosen one.

281
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:22,467
I am not?

282
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,104
I am not!

283
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:30,408
Guess what that means?

284
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:37,048
(Tohru growls)

285
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:38,950
Rahhrrrr!

286
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:50,394
When the true
chosen one is found,

287
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:52,930
I shall return.

288
00:18:52,932 --> 00:18:54,899
That is what you think!

289
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:58,736
Ow!

290
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:03,307
Yaaah!

291
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:08,379
Go, uncle.

292
00:19:08,381 --> 00:19:10,581
Now your temple is safe.

293
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,817
Tao long
and his dark warriors

294
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:14,652
may not enter again.

295
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,093
Duh! Grr...

296
00:19:22,095 --> 00:19:23,561
Gyuh...Gyuh!

297
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:27,431
I insist.

298
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:33,604
Um, my apologies
about the mix-up.

299
00:19:33,606 --> 00:19:35,706
The chosen one
will be found

300
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,675
when the time is right.

301
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,244
Go in peace, friend.

302
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:48,452
Could it be that you
found the right place,

303
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:50,888
but the wrong vessel?

304
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,823
Did you see
how the girl child

305
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:55,526
wielded the chosen one's
walking stick?

306
00:19:57,462 --> 00:20:01,632
It is as if her chi
and his were one.

307
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:07,705
Perhaps we should see
if she remembers the yak.

308
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:14,645
Hey, Jackie.

309
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:15,780
Yes?

310
00:20:15,782 --> 00:20:16,847
Are the characters
in the show

311
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:18,482
based on people
you know?

312
00:20:18,484 --> 00:20:20,651
I think, yes.

313
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:22,286
When I look at the uncle,

314
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:24,322
the way he speak,
"ooh, ooh, ooh."

315
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:27,959
Half like my father,
half like my manager.

316
00:20:27,961 --> 00:20:31,862
Jade, yes. So many young
girls like the niece.

317
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:34,365
Of course, not the bad guy.
The shadowkhan.

318
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:36,634
He's got--that's--
that's--you make somebody.

319
00:20:36,636 --> 00:20:37,868
Tohru?

320
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:40,404
One of my stunt guys.

321
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:43,507
The character of myself,
sometimes very comedy,

322
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:44,909
sometimes very serious.

323
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:45,910
That's me.
