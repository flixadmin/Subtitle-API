1
00:00:02,085 --> 00:00:04,087
<i>My name is Damien Darhk.</i>

2
00:00:04,421 --> 00:00:06,139
<i>In 2016</i>

3
00:00:06,298 --> 00:00:08,141
<i>I was murdered by the Green Arrow.</i>

4
00:00:08,592 --> 00:00:11,687
<i>But I was removed from the timeline
31 years before my death</i>

5
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:15,270
<i>by a speedster from the future
named Eobard Thawne.</i>

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,194
<i>Together with Malcolm Merlyn, the former
head of the League of Assassins,</i>

7
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:22,527
<i>the three of us are going to locate
the Spear of Destiny,</i>

8
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:26,364
<i>a mystical object
which can rewrite reality itself.</i>

9
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:30,623
<i>With the Spear in our possession,
we will change our past and our future</i>

10
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:33,000
<i>and the world as you know it.</i>

11
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:35,994
RIP: <i>Previously, on</i>
Legends of Tomorrow...

12
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:37,333
GIDEON: <i>A deep scan reveals that.</i>

13
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,791
<i>Captain Hunter's neural architecture
has been reprogrammed</i>

14
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:40,999
<i>with a new identity.</i>

15
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:42,463
<i>The Longinus Medallion.</i>

16
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:46,630
WHITE CANARY: <i>Rip!</i>

17
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:50,301
EOBARD: <i>I know that you're one of
the protectors of the Spear of Destiny.</i>

18
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:53,353
And I know that you know
where the other pieces are hidden.

19
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,972
You're gonna torture me, aren't you?

20
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:56,355
I'm not going to torture you.

21
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:57,724
<i>They are.</i>

22
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:08,653
REPORTER: <i>Damien Darhk, the man
behind tonight's siege of Star City,</i>

23
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:12,198
<i>was killed by the masked vigilante
known as the Green Arrow.</i>

24
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:14,833
<i>Amateur cell phone video
captured his final moments,</i>

25
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:17,666
<i>putting an end to the chaos
that has gripped the city.</i>

26
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:41,026
This is the great Malcolm Merlyn?

27
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:42,276
I am unimpressed.

28
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:44,029
EOBARD: Well, he's fallen on hard times.

29
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:46,189
But this man used to be Ra's al Ghul.

30
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:51,245
We haven't met. I'm Eobard Thawne.

31
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:52,871
I'm from the future.

32
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:56,371
What the hell is going on here?

33
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,293
Excellent question. Here's another.

34
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:00,625
Do you believe in second chances?

35
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,956
I just watched you die.

36
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:07,427
Yeah, I hear 2016's not my best year,
but I plan on fixing that.

37
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,466
EOBARD: But the question for you, Malcolm,

38
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:12,884
is do you wish to see your fortunes
similarly reversed?

39
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,386
By time travel?

40
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:17,388
No. No.

41
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,061
Something much better.

42
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:41,416
- Well?
- No luck so far.

43
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:44,256
It's not that
Captain Hunter's uncooperative,

44
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:47,418
it's that he's not fully in possession
of his marbles.

45
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:50,508
So he won't tell us where
the rest of the Spear of Destiny is.

46
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,259
Eh, It's more like "can't."

47
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,095
Which wouldn't be such a problem

48
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:56,430
if you two idiots hadn't lost
the Longinus Medallion.

49
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:59,847
I seem to remember
you being there as well.

50
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,105
Until you weren't.

51
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,692
I hate when he does that.

52
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,353
If you have something
to say to me, Malcolm,

53
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,613
I suggest you keep it to yourself.

54
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:09,815
I'm sorry.

55
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,866
Am I supposed to be afraid of you?

56
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,493
Oh, I would be.

57
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:16,622
Considering I can kill you
before you even knew I was doing it.

58
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,781
Ah, yes.

59
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:20,201
But then you wouldn't get what you want.

60
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:23,962
You brought me and Damien
into your little quest for a reason.

61
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:25,373
Without the Medallion,

62
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:28,008
Hunter is our only way
to get the rest of the Spear.

63
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,134
You need me to get it out of him.

64
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,837
We already tried torture.

65
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:33,505
MALCOLM: <i>I'm not talking about torture.</i>

66
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,344
I'm talking about hypnosis.

67
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:37,513
Regression therapy.

68
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:43,186
Hunter's mind is locked away.

69
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:44,641
I've got the key.

70
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:52,862
Is this some technique you picked up
with the League of Assassins?

71
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,869
The League didn't call me
"the Magician" for nothing.

72
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:57,575
EOBARD: <i>Well, be quick about it.</i>

73
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,494
Speedsters aren't known
for their patience.

74
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:05,996
What's to keep Hunter's crew
from finding the rest of the Spear

75
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:08,916
before Merlyn finishes
unscrambling Hunter's brain?

76
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,835
The workings of the Medallion
are lost to history.

77
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:14,672
Trying to get it to reveal
its secrets will prove difficult.

78
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:17,512
Plus, we have
an additional advantage over them.

79
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:19,055
Enlighten me.

80
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,344
They're idiots.

81
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,347
- You're all idiots.
- AMAYA: Excuse me?

82
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:24,685
Pot, meet kettle.

83
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:26,850
Yeah, Mick, given your glass house,
you shouldn't throw stones.

84
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:29,019
Mixing metaphors isn't going
to solve anything.

85
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:30,187
How about instead of bickering,

86
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,693
we figure out our next move
against the speedster and his allies?

87
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:34,449
"Legion of Doom" has a sexier ring to it.

88
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:35,780
I'm not calling them that.

89
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,787
And we need to figure out
a way to rescue Rip.

90
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:42,283
All you got to do is trade the amulet
or the Medallion for the Englishman.

91
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:43,621
It's really simple.

92
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:45,286
The only thing is
I don't know how it works.

93
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:47,371
Mmm, you're an idiot.

94
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:49,877
You want to put an artifact
that can rewrite reality

95
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,087
into the hands of the enemy

96
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:52,671
- and we're the idiots?
- Mmm-hmm.

97
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:55,129
Our priority has to be
identifying this speedster.

98
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:56,550
Of course you'd say that.

99
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,932
I mean, he is the one
that killed your boyfriend, so...

100
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,137
He's at the center of this

101
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:01,930
and you can't defeat an enemy
that you don't know.

102
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:04,938
Look, Amaya's right.
And, I hate to say it, but so is Mick.

103
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,097
BOTH: I'm not an idiot.

104
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,728
Not about being idiots.

105
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:10,311
About using the Medallion as leverage.

106
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,605
But first, we need to figure out
how it works.

107
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,444
Well, in my defense,
it's a mystical object.

108
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:16,074
It doesn't come
with a set of instructions.

109
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:17,234
Maybe that's been the problem.

110
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,277
Approaching it from a mystical vantage

111
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,446
instead of leaning into our strengths
which are...

112
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:22,910
- Technological.
- Exactly.

113
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:25,576
And, as it happens,
I have a colleague in Central City

114
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,666
whose knowledge
might prove to be advantageous.

115
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:32,416
Gideon, set a course
for Central City, 2017.

116
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:33,925
Jax, stick with Martin.

117
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:36,803
And let's work on
putting a name to our speedster.

118
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,684
Aw! Here comes a man
who looks like he just struck out.

119
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:44,470
Don't get smug with me, Damien.

120
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:47,435
I may not have all my prior resources,
but at least I'm not dead.

121
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,808
Look, I couldn't get Hunter to remember

122
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:52,444
because his memories
aren't buried or locked away.

123
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:54,604
They're gone.

124
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:57,449
It's like his old self didn't exist.

125
00:05:57,983 --> 00:05:59,326
Are you sure about that?

126
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,779
Do you think you can do any better?
You are welcome to try.

127
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:03,288
We already tried torture.

128
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:04,823
<i>You know what I love about torture?</i>

129
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,618
I'm not sure if we have enough time
for me to list all the reasons,

130
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:11,459
but mainly it's because
there's always another gear to find.

131
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,879
This is what I get for relying
on a washout and a dead man.

132
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:20,464
I don't like that guy.

133
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:26,888
Hmm. You know, I'll be honest.

134
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,140
Which, I have to admit,
I don't have much practice in.

135
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,650
I don't like this situation.

136
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:34,986
Not one bit.

137
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,487
For one thing,

138
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:39,570
Mr. Thawne has this habit
of treating me like a henchman.

139
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:45,414
Do you know what all henchmen
have in common, Captain Hunter?

140
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:47,706
No thoughts on this one?

141
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:52,584
The thing that all henchmen have in common
is that they all end up dead.

142
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:56,713
A fate that I am fastidiously
trying to avoid.

143
00:06:57,042 --> 00:07:00,342
Maybe it's that I just hate taking orders
or being threatened.

144
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:02,677
You don't like being threatened, do you?

145
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:03,840
Hmm?

146
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:06,176
What's that? Oh, sorry.

147
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:11,023
<i>- Oh, God. No.
- Yeah, neither do I.</i>

148
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:16,529
Which is why I need your cooperation
to end Mr. Thawne's tedious threats.

149
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:20,028
Look, I...
I don't know anything. I swear...

150
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,191
Shh!

151
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:24,741
I can't take your word for it.
But don't worry.

152
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:27,865
I'll start you off with an easy question.

153
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:33,419
Right eye or left eye?

154
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,214
Please. Please. Don't. I'll do anything!

155
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:38,876
I'll tell you anything you want to know
even if I don't know.

156
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:40,635
- Please don't!
- Shh.

157
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,220
Second question,

158
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:45,720
when was the last time
you had any dental work done?

159
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:49,302
What? No. No, God.

160
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,820
It may not be in the best condition,
but then again,

161
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,276
Captain Hunter is British.

162
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,274
You pulled out his tooth.

163
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:05,486
As torture goes,
isn't that kind of bush league?

164
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:06,782
Look closer.

165
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:08,906
Thank you, but no.

166
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:18,165
There's some markings on here
like a bar code.

167
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:19,749
Account information.

168
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,294
From a security deposit box
in Switzerland.

169
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,425
Who puts that kind of information
on a tooth?

170
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,507
A Time Master.
That's no ordinary security box.

171
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,176
My thinking exactly.

172
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,596
Now, it's possible the box could contain
his son's birth certificate and the like.

173
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,436
But given the exotic nature of the care
that's been taken here,

174
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,521
- I would have to assume...
- It's the rest of the Spear.

175
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,987
- When was it last accessed?
- January, 2025.

176
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:44,824
Oh, you got somewhere to go?

177
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,944
Funny. Just like clockwork.

178
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:53,451
Take the Time Sphere back to 2025
and secure the rest of the Spear.

179
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:57,124
The next one of you who screws up
will lose more than just a tooth.

180
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,130
Well, I'd hate to see you
lose another hand, Malcolm.

181
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,309
JAX: <i>Seriously, Grey?</i>

182
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,726
I know you didn't bring me to 2017

183
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,141
just so we could get lattes
and Frappuccinos, man.

184
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:18,308
Of course not.

185
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:21,820
It's just my colleague merely frequents
this establishment at this hour.

186
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,486
Sorry, Jefferson.
You should go back to the <i>Waverider.</i>

187
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:26,695
I can handle things from here.

188
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,819
What the hell is going on with you, man?

189
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,032
LILY: <i>Dad?</i>

190
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:31,996
I didn't know you were coming to town.

191
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:33,323
"Dad"?

192
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,367
- <i>Well, I wanted to surprise you.</i>
- LILY: Oh.

193
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:38,002
Wait, your colleague is your daughter?

194
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:41,415
Lily, this is my friend Jefferson.
Jefferson, this is my daughter.

195
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,673
Nice to meet you.

196
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,334
Hi.

197
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,503
- Shall we sit down?
- Yeah.

198
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:49,677
- Over here.
- This is so weird.

199
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:53,722
Because I didn't think
I'd get the chance to meet you.

200
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,017
Like, ever, but, uh, here we are.

201
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,357
Uh, I was explaining to Jefferson

202
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,193
how you might be able
to assist us with the, um...

203
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,528
Research project.

204
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,364
Sort of like <i>Indiana Jones.</i>

205
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:07,941
- Yeah, sort of.
- Mmm-hmm.

206
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,285
You brought it to a coffee shop?

207
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:15,907
Oh, well, for one thing,

208
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:19,040
it's throwing off
low levels of ionic radiation.

209
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:21,463
Is that an ionic transmographer?

210
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,373
I've never seen one smaller than a house.

211
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,383
Yeah, I had an idea
for hyperminiaturization

212
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:26,543
when I was in Tahiti.

213
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,715
I don't vacation well.

214
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:34,969
You know, I'm thinking
a shortwave ionic pulse might...

215
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,061
Hey.

216
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:45,486
Perhaps we should, uh,
take our little research project

217
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,273
somewhere a bit more private.

218
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:56,661
A temporal navigation vessel. L...
I absolutely cannot believe it.

219
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:57,953
Urn, hello, who are you?

220
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:00,915
Oh, hi, I'm Lily. I'm Martin's daughter.

221
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,829
We didn't know Martin had a daughter.

222
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,126
Yeah, you told me you didn't have kids.

223
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:06,587
Well, I like to keep
my private life private.

224
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:09,423
There's private and there's lying.
Sara, did you know about this?

225
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:12,631
Oh, I know all about this.

226
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:18,015
What are you doing?

227
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:19,680
I'm trying to make up my mind.

228
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:23,441
I mean, Eobard has such a delicious
selection of killing devices.

229
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,649
We can't just storm into the bank
and demand to see the deposit box.

230
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,104
We absolutely can.

231
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:29,864
We're former members
of the League of Assassins.

232
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:33,197
This operation requires subtlety,
not a bloodbath.

233
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,446
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm not up
on current events,

234
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:39,162
but might this squeamishness
that I'm witnessing

235
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:40,951
be the cause of your downfall?

236
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:42,202
Hunter is an asset,

237
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,292
one that we can use
to gain access to our objective.

238
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:47,503
To not use him is foolish.

239
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:49,467
Oh. Well, in that case

240
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:53,301
I would have to defer
to your superior expertise in foolishness.

241
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,174
But if your plan goes south,

242
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:59,636
it's not our speedster friend
you need to worry about.

243
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:03,390
One thing I hate more
than taking orders from him

244
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:06,977
is being threatened by you.

245
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,697
Luckily, Damien,

246
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,076
I don't find you threatening.

247
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:21,532
Hmm.

248
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:33,961
What's the big deal?

249
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:36,677
The professor didn't have a kid
and now he does.

250
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,307
- <i>Mazel tov.</i>
- Thank you.

251
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:43,306
The big deal is Lily is a Time Aberration,
which was all well and good

252
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:47,442
until you plucked her out of 2017
and showed her a Timeship,

253
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,728
which could cause more Aberrations.

254
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:52,989
- Hey, what are you looking at me for?
- Because you were with him.

255
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,115
I, quite simply, missed my daughter.

256
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:58,700
If Lily's presence on the <i>Waverider</i>
posed any temporal issues,

257
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,613
I'm sure Gideon would have detected them.

258
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:04,284
Plus, Grey said Lily could
hook the Medallion up with Gideon so...

259
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,002
Wait, she wants to try networking
the ancient amulet

260
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,459
with an advanced Al system?

261
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:10,999
I'm totally helping.

262
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:13,543
Fine. Then I would appreciate it if you...

263
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:17,639
If none of you would reveal to her
that she's an Aberration.

264
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,265
Why are you looking at me?

265
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:21,017
So where are we
on identifying the speedster?

266
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:23,303
I think the technical term is "nowhere".

267
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,473
All the speedsters that Flash faced
are either dead or his friends.

268
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,267
Or people he thought were his friends,
and are now dead.

269
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:30,981
SARA: <i>Okay, we will figure this out.</i>

270
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:33,818
And in the meantime,
you and Lily keep working with the amulet

271
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,948
to figure out where
the rest of the Spear is.

272
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,820
Who's to say he won't kill us anyway,

273
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:43,160
even after we've gotten
his precious Spear?

274
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:46,372
Oh, forget it. Why am I asking you?

275
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,036
I don't know, man. I don't know anything.

276
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:51,502
I don't even know why you're getting me
to wear this... This... This...

277
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:52,711
This monkey suit.

278
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:55,423
- And my mouth is so sore...
- Quit whining.

279
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:59,969
Fact of the matter
is we have something in common, Rip.

280
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:02,096
- My name is Phil.
- Whatever.

281
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,477
We are both dealing
with unstable individuals.

282
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:07,058
And that is not something I enjoy.

283
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:10,391
Hey, this is not exactly
a walk in the park for me either.

284
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:11,855
Which is why

285
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:16,819
you will do exactly as I say.

286
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,526
Then maybe, just maybe,

287
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:21,828
you'll make it through this alive.

288
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,701
Cool. All right. Um...

289
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:27,033
What... What is it you want me to...
To do?

290
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:30,875
Tell me, Phil,
have you ever been to Switzerland?

291
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:43,175
MALCOLM: Put this in your ear.

292
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:45,510
- What is it'?
- Communication device.

293
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,804
Really? It's so small.

294
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,438
Do it or I'll shove it down your throat.

295
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,641
MALCOLM: It will allow us to monitor you.

296
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,268
This is very simple.

297
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,107
You go to the bank associate

298
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:58,569
and you tell them
you want to access security box 4587.

299
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,826
4587, right. What do I do then?

300
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,863
Bring the contents of said box back to us.
If you don't, you'll be killed.

301
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,121
- Really?
- What?

302
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,873
I'm motivating him.

303
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:09,993
In and out.
Take no longer than five minutes.

304
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,581
You will be fine.

305
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:12,870
I'll be fine.

306
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,548
I'll be fine. Okay.

307
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:18,380
This would be easier
if we just killed everybody.

308
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:22,638
Hi, how are you?

309
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:25,926
I'd like box 4587, please.

310
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:28,557
Sure. Have a seat.

311
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:31,893
MALCOLM: <i>What do you think
is going on with him?</i>

312
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,685
It's simple. His mind is pudding.

313
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,233
Not Hunter. Thawne.

314
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:40,239
It's strange how he never stays
in one place for very long.

315
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:42,821
Perhaps that's why they refer to them
as "speedsters".

316
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:46,321
What, you think he left us behind
in 1967, Los Angeles,

317
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:48,831
<i>because he had a more pressing engagement?</i>

318
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:50,784
What about what he said to us earlier?

319
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,247
That he wanted to kill one of us?

320
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,504
No. That he didn't know
why he was relying on us.

321
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,543
I mean, fair question.

322
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,759
Why does a time-traveling speedster
need to rely on anyone?

323
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:01,878
Thawne's hiding something.

324
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,222
Wouldn't you like to know what it is?

325
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,976
Thawne said we knew each other
back in 2016.

326
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,435
Do I really become so stupid

327
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,183
that you think
these mind tricks will work on me?

328
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,347
I am not trying...

329
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:15,646
A trio such as ours
turning one against each other

330
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,436
for your own benefit
is not only obvious but cliché.

331
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,109
Thawne does not treat us as equals to him.

332
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:24,074
And until he does,
neither of us is getting what he wants.

333
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:29,409
All right, let's go over this again.

334
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,290
- I've already been over it, Sara.
- Mmm-hmm.

335
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,205
- Again and again.
- And again.

336
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,790
We're obviously dealing with a new player.

337
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:37,254
Whoever this speedster is,

338
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,541
it's someone you and your friends
haven't encountered before.

339
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:42,301
Which means this speedster
is from the future which makes sense

340
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,007
because speedsters can time travel.

341
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:46,681
Then what would the speedster
need the Spear of Destiny for?

342
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,183
He could just go back
and change history himself.

343
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:52,102
But not reality.
That's why he needs the Spear.

344
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,973
Question is,
what is this speedster trying to change?

345
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:58,355
Or fix.

346
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,478
That's the question.

347
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:03,109
He knows what we want to do
with the Spear of Destiny,

348
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,240
<i>but he's being very coy about his plans.</i>

349
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:16,002
Here you are, Mr. Hunter.

350
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,251
Please lean towards the panel,
if you would.

351
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:22,754
- Excuse me?
- A retinal scan.

352
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,840
- Rectal scanner?
- What?

353
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:26,258
MALCOLM:
<i>It's an eye scan.</i>

354
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:28,006
Part of the bank's security.

355
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:30,509
You know,
this whole situation sucks,

356
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:33,053
but man, I love being in the future.

357
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:34,391
- What?
- What?

358
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:37,515
Retinal scan. Right.

359
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:51,533
Why, uh... Why is it not working?

360
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:55,496
Voice ID is next.
You need to speak your access code.

361
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:57,539
"Access code"?

362
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:58,828
Oh, boy.

363
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:00,246
Oh, boy.

364
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:03,541
Yes, sir. The one you set
when you opened your account.

365
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:04,750
Uh...

366
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:07,174
- MALCOLM: <i>Get out of there now.</i>
- Yeah.

367
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:09,805
No. Don't.

368
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,760
MALCOLM: <i>Go. Move.</i>
DARHK: <i>Don't.</i>

369
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:19,599
- This was your plan.
- Which I am trying to execute.

370
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,234
And failing spectacularly per usual.

371
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,520
We can't just let them call security.

372
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:26,906
I'm calling security.

373
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:30,193
Great idea, security... No...
Security is awesome.

374
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,825
You weren't planning on going rogue
on us now, were you, Rip?

375
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:40,002
I have told you, my name is Phil!

376
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:41,583
All right, Phil.
It was lovely knowing you.

377
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:42,918
Don't! We still need him.

378
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:44,339
He's useless to us.

379
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,000
Hey, I can be more useful.

380
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,503
Damn it. Security's gonna be
on top of us at any moment.

381
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,763
Might I suggest you kill them instead?

382
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:55,139
Try and run and I will find you
and feed you your testicles.

383
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:56,302
Okay.

384
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:58,429
Oh, my God.

385
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,074
Reinforcements are on their way.

386
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:20,622
Let's get the hell out of here.

387
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:40,062
LILY: <i>Okay. That should just about do it.</i>

388
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:42,185
RAY: Now we just have to
activate the Medallion,

389
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,768
- and see if Gideon can access its data.
- Okay.

390
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,488
So, what are we waiting for?

391
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:52,237
Nothing.

392
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,620
It's just... If we've underestimated
the size of the artifact's data-stream...

393
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:58,577
We'll fry the ship's CPU
and we'll all spend the rest of our lives

394
00:19:58,739 --> 00:19:59,786
stranded in the Temporal Zone?

395
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:02,043
<i>The ship's CPU has a name.</i>

396
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,202
Sorry, Gideon.

397
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:05,246
<i>Can we at least talk about this
before you connect...</i>

398
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,627
Gideon?

399
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:12,758
You still there?

400
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,048
- Oh, my God, we killed her.
- Oh...

401
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:19,644
<i>Artificial intelligences cannot,
by definition, be killed, Dr. Palmer.</i>

402
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:21,395
- Yes, I know.
- It's pretty remarkable

403
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:25,104
considering we just mainlined
1.2 zettabytes directly into her brain.

404
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:26,267
Yeah.

405
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:29,108
<i>I'm processing the Medallion's
temporal output as we speak.</i>

406
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:33,032
- Ah! Nice work, Doctor.
- Doctor.

407
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,993
You don't happen to have
any champagne on this ship, do you?

408
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:42,287
Ah, 1998 Blanc de Noirs.

409
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,539
- Mmm.
- But I like beer.

410
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:46,875
Gets me drunk.

411
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,668
To Lily.

412
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:53,551
- To Gideon.
- Hmm.

413
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,767
Wow. That tastes real!

414
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,102
It's completely synthetic.

415
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,229
The food fabricator can make anything.

416
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:05,639
Except American cheese,

417
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,524
which is pretty much
synthetic to begin with.

418
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:09,397
Beluga caviar?

419
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,437
Fake food never tasted so good.

420
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:14,190
Fake food for a fake person.

421
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:18,326
What did you say?

422
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,787
He didn't say anything.

423
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:25,459
Everyone has been looking at me weird
ever since I came on board the ship.

424
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,754
What are you not telling me?

425
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:32,462
Cat's out of the bag, Haircut.
You may as well tell her.

426
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:33,672
Tell me what?

427
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,673
Tell me what?

428
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:42,227
Sweetheart, I don't wanna
rain on your parade, but you're a, uh...

429
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,136
How would the professor put it?

430
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,143
An abrasion. No, that's not it. Um...

431
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:48,645
Asphyxiation.

432
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:52,395
Aberration. You're a Time Aberration.

433
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:54,313
You're a Time Aberration.

434
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,358
Ray?

435
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,319
What is a Time Aberration?

436
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,821
Um...

437
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,073
I think maybe you should talk to your dad.

438
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,334
Perhaps we could all just talk about

439
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:12,714
- what went wrong.
- Shh.

440
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:15,543
Oh, I know what went wrong.
I listened to him.

441
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,094
If you'd have listened to me,

442
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:19,381
<i>we would have walked out of that bank
instead of being chased out.</i>

443
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:21,845
Either way, we came out empty-handed.

444
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:26,187
I seem to remember Eobard mentioning
how he was going to punish your failure.

445
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:28,022
If anyone's a failure, it's you.

446
00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:31,017
You were the one who learned
about Hunter's secret account,

447
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,982
yet seemed not to know about a passcode.

448
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,521
<i>Sloppy, Damien.</i>

449
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:37,690
No wonder they passed you over for Ra's.

450
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:41,493
You see this is where he reminds me
that he was Ra's al Ghul.

451
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:43,654
Poor Malcolm, always living in the past.

452
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:46,165
This is when I remind you
about your future.

453
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:47,992
Aw...

454
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,452
That's right. I've been there.

455
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:52,584
I've seen how pathetic you are.

456
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:57,384
In this future that you're from,
do I at least have two hands?

457
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:01,255
Either way, I intend to change my future,

458
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:03,720
but look at you now. You're pathetic.

459
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:06,352
I don't even know why Thawne recruited you
in the first place.

460
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:09,973
We could argue all night, Damien,
but I don't want to bore our guest here

461
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:13,017
with your impotent insults
and recriminations.

462
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:16,271
What are you suggesting?

463
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:18,572
You recall how we resolve disputes
within the League?

464
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:19,773
Mmm-hmm.

465
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:21,074
Now...

466
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:27,157
I suggest you choose a blade
that matches that sharp tongue of yours.

467
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,124
Excuse me for a second.

468
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,747
Gladly.

469
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:34,963
PROFESSOR STEIN:
<i>You did it, my darling!</i>

470
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:37,500
You created an interface
between a mystical relic

471
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:41,091
from the first century
and a 22nd-century supercomputer.

472
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,172
Only a Stein could be so brilliant.

473
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,299
What is a Time Aberration?

474
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:48,344
- I'm sorry, what?
- You heard me, Dad.

475
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:56,353
An Aberration is an unnatural alteration
of history as a result of time travel.

476
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:58,521
Dad?

477
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,488
Am I...

478
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:03,155
Am I an Aberration?

479
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:09,373
That word could never describe who you are
or how much you mean to me.

480
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,666
- So it's true.
- Please let me explain.

481
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:15,204
That's why you were acting so weird

482
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:17,957
when you visited Central City
the first time.

483
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:20,627
The reason you were treating me
like a stranger...

484
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:22,340
Was because you didn't even exist

485
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:25,632
the last time I boarded this ship
and left 2016.

486
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:28,551
But now you do exist.
And that's all that matters.

487
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:29,809
How could this be happening?

488
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:32,013
Well, it's really quite simple.

489
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:36,897
You see, I interacted
with my younger self back in 1987,

490
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:40,063
who then interacted
with your mother's former self,

491
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:43,574
and when two former selves
love each other...

492
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,860
Okay, Dad, we've already had
the birds-and-bees talk.

493
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,152
I was 10.

494
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:48,904
Or did we?

495
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:50,994
That's a very interesting point.

496
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:54,251
I mean, who's to say
which of our realities is real

497
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,663
and which one is aberrant?

498
00:24:56,829 --> 00:25:00,083
It's really a matter of perspective.
Actually, it's quite fascinating...

499
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:02,343
This is not fascinating, Dad!

500
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:04,754
This is a nightmare.

501
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:07,257
Lily, I'm so sorry.

502
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:09,266
This is not how I wanted you to find out.

503
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:11,052
No. No, I get it.

504
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:15,765
You didn't want kids
when you first came on board this Timeship.

505
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,777
But now you have me.

506
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:45,135
You just reminded me of something.

507
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:46,295
Which is?

508
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:47,967
How much I've missed this.

509
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:15,491
Okay, stop, stop! Time-out! Time-out!

510
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:18,498
Can't you see
that this is what your boss wants?

511
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:21,171
For his underlings
to be at one another's throats?

512
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,173
Like, literally?

513
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,462
He is not our boss.

514
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:25,672
Did he call us "underlings"?

515
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:27,511
Oh, I'm sorry. Uh...

516
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:29,671
"Henchmen"?

517
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:31,340
Try again.

518
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:34,101
Wait, wait, wait. What if he's right?

519
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:37,183
You actually care what this
pudding-brained hippie has to say?

520
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,019
It's just like the movie,
<i>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.</i>

521
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,108
Three bad guys, no one knows who to trust,

522
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,361
so they all end up
screwing each other over.

523
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:46,275
It's an interesting theory.

524
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,482
- Which one are we?
<i>- The point is</i>

525
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:50,026
that neither of you are Clint Eastwood,

526
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:53,537
and so neither of you
end up going home with the gold.

527
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,034
We're not after the gold.

528
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:57,370
I know, I know. I know what you're after.

529
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:59,786
You, you want to change your past.

530
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:03,000
And you, you want to change your future.

531
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:07,711
And the fast guy is the only one
who can make those two things happen.

532
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:12,055
I told you.
Thawne doesn't treat us as equals.

533
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:14,682
Even the hippie knows it.
And he also knows

534
00:27:14,842 --> 00:27:17,721
that the only way to stop Thawne
from screwing us over

535
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:20,184
is for us to work together.

536
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:23,692
Two former members
of the League of Assassins

537
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:25,353
versus a speedster.

538
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:29,072
I am liking those odds.

539
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:42,290
- Dude. What is going on with you?
- What do you mean?

540
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:43,954
And don't call me "dude".

541
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:45,919
I've gotten used
to sharing a brain with you,

542
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:49,676
but this, whatever this is,
this is something new.

543
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:52,255
Just enjoying a cup of Earl Grey.

544
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:54,469
Is that whiskey?

545
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:55,887
Of course it's not whiskey!

546
00:27:56,717 --> 00:27:58,685
It's brandy.
What do you take me for, a sailor?

547
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:01,601
Okay, let's start this over. Hmm?

548
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,141
Come on.

549
00:28:06,894 --> 00:28:08,020
Fine.

550
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,194
I made a terrible mistake.

551
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:14,610
I should never have brought Lily
on board this ship.

552
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:19,624
She found out.
She knows she is an Aberration.

553
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:23,377
Sir Rory spilled the beans, as predicted.

554
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:27,547
So what you gonna do?

555
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,301
What can I do?

556
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,136
Just tell her how you feel.

557
00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:35,263
She knows how I feel.
It goes without saying.

558
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:39,427
Yeah, for us it does.
We have a psychic connection, but for her?

559
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:42,809
<i>She just hears whatever comes out
of that big brain of yours.</i>

560
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:47,810
Just tell her you love her.
That's what dads do.

561
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:50,070
Clearly, you never met my father.

562
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:54,908
You know, the...

563
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:57,991
The reason Clarissa and I chose
not to have children

564
00:28:58,153 --> 00:28:59,905
the first time around was because...

565
00:29:01,615 --> 00:29:04,118
I feared that history would repeat itself,

566
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:08,084
that I would be
the kind of father that he was.

567
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:12,672
We're Legends, Grey.

568
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:15,463
Changing history is what we do.

569
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:27,441
Why would a speedster
need to change reality?

570
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,943
How many times
are you gonna ask that question?

571
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:31,445
Until we have an answer.

572
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:33,355
She's right.

573
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:35,616
Speedsters can time travel,
so what's stopping him

574
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,993
from changing history
even without the Spear?

575
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:43,331
Unless he doesn't exist.

576
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:46,038
Okay, so what, he's a ghost?

577
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:48,420
What if he's a Temporal Aberration
just like...

578
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:50,080
Excuse me,
have any of you have seen my daughter?

579
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:52,466
- One second, Professor.
- Sorry, this is quite urgent.

580
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:56,174
Look, what if instead of creating a person
like you did with Lily,

581
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:58,634
our mystery speedster
erased himself from history?

582
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:00,974
- Why would he want to do that?
<i>- I don't know.</i>

583
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:04,603
But it would explain why we don't have
any evidence of his existence.

584
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,439
Okay, so we just need to ID
someone who doesn't exist.

585
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:09,979
Eobard Thawne.

586
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:13,191
- Um, is... Is he okay?
- I'm fine.

587
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:17,574
Eobard Thawne is a name.
The name of a speedster who...

588
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:18,942
Who what?

589
00:30:21,445 --> 00:30:24,244
PROFESSOR STEIN: <i>Thawne was erased
from existence when his progenitor,</i>

590
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:27,543
<i>Eddie Thawne, committed suicide
in order to stop him.</i>

591
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:31,380
Which would explain why the Time Masters
didn't have a file on him.

592
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,253
But if Thawne doesn't exist then how...

593
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,167
He was protected from his ancestor's death

594
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:37,257
because he was a member
of the Speed Force.

595
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,593
- It's a little complicated.
- A little.

596
00:30:48,055 --> 00:30:49,807
Oh, and for the record,
this is how I wanted

597
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,566
to approach things in the first place.

598
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:53,898
Only because you enjoy
killing a lot of people.

599
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:55,278
DARHK: As if you don't.

600
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:02,945
<i>All right,
that's pretty impressive, Malcolm,</i>

601
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:04,454
but how did you get Hunter's passcode?

602
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:05,739
It's not Hunter's.

603
00:31:05,906 --> 00:31:08,534
It's the bank manager's
security override code.

604
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:11,287
- It only cost him three fingers.
- Ah.

605
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:17,292
Yes.

606
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:18,502
Ow!

607
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:28,428
Going somewhere?

608
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:30,229
No.

609
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:34,777
Yes. What do you expect me to do?

610
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,609
Your partners just left me here
all tied up.

611
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:39,981
Where are they?

612
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:45,120
They told me not to tell you.

613
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:48,824
The bank, they're... They're at the bank.

614
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:52,585
Look, you could help yourself
to whatever is in that safe deposit box.

615
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:57,090
But please, please just let me go, man.
Let me go.

616
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,144
Does this look like a Spear to you?

617
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:18,486
It most certainly does not.

618
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:20,359
It's a mnemonic archive.

619
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:22,650
I'm sorry.
Are we supposed to know what that means?

620
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:24,693
Since it won't be invented
for a century, no.

621
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,862
This device is designed to store memories.

622
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,697
Rip Hunter's, I'd assume.

623
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:32,459
Guys, I think I just figured it out,

624
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:35,962
why a seemingly invincible speedster
would need to take on partners.

625
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:38,006
By all means, Dr. Heywood,
please enlighten us.

626
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:40,709
Okay, what if Thawne
isn't just chasing us?

627
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:42,674
What if he's running from something?

628
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:44,512
But running from what?

629
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:47,474
- Time.
- And time takes time to harden.

630
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:51,887
And if Thawne ceased to exist the moment
his great-great whatever killed himself,

631
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:54,055
then maybe he has to keep moving

632
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:57,852
in order for his own nonexistence
not to catch up with him.

633
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,060
Boom.

634
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:01,480
That doesn't even begin to make
any kind of sense.

635
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:02,898
I don't know. It could work.

636
00:33:03,857 --> 00:33:05,700
Professor, what do you think?

637
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:08,820
Per the scientific method,
there's only one way to prove it.

638
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:13,367
You'd have to trap Thawne in one place
and then see what happens.

639
00:33:16,203 --> 00:33:17,420
What do you think you're doing?

640
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:19,840
Renegotiating the terms
of our partnership.

641
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:23,085
And it is going to be a partnership.

642
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,753
We need a bit more of a guarantee

643
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,423
that you're going to uphold
your end of our bargain.

644
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:32,852
I'll guarantee you one thing.

645
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,729
If you don't open that door,

646
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:37,107
- I'll kill you.

647
00:33:37,891 --> 00:33:41,566
Yes, but I'm the only one
who knows the code to open it.

648
00:33:44,606 --> 00:33:46,574
Perhaps you can persuade
our friend to cooperate.

649
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,781
Me? No. I'd rather see how this plays out.

650
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:51,279
Oh...

651
00:33:52,072 --> 00:33:53,790
It seems you two have formed an alliance.

652
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:55,784
There's just one problem.

653
00:33:55,951 --> 00:33:58,124
That you're the only one who can
give us what we want. Yes, we know.

654
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:02,048
You're always so quick to remind us
how much we need you, Eobard.

655
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:04,084
But, clearly, you need us.

656
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:07,220
You could have gotten in this vault
all by yourself. Why didn't you?

657
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:10,298
And for that matter,

658
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:14,394
why would a man who can travel
through time always be in such a hurry?

659
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:15,808
We don't have time for this.

660
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:18,315
Oh, I've got all the time in the world.

661
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,489
Okay! Okay. You two have made your point.

662
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:33,663
I need you as much
as you need me, all right?

663
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:37,122
But if you do not open that door,
he is going to kill us!

664
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:38,456
He is coming for me!

665
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:40,621
- Who's coming for you?
- It's not a who.

666
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:43,503
It's a... It's a... A what.

667
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:45,338
- A thing.
- What thing?

668
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,843
Can you be a little more specific?

669
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:50,632
My ancestor kills himself
in an effort to erase my very existence.

670
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:53,016
Well, you look pretty spry despite it.

671
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:54,513
The Flash pulled me from the timeline.

672
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:56,553
He held me captive for months.

673
00:34:56,845 --> 00:35:01,726
And when I finally got loose,
I found myself pursued by something.

674
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:04,064
I thought it was a time wraith,

675
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:07,322
the monsters that hunt speedsters
who mess with time.

676
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:13,244
<i>But whatever is hunting me
is far worse than a time wraith.</i>

677
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:19,659
It can sense the Speed Force.

678
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:22,545
And it's trying to kill me.

679
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:25,253
Interesting. So that's why
you keep running out on us.

680
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:28,548
Huh. So you're kind of like a shark
who'll die if you stay in one place.

681
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,678
We are all going to die if you don't...

682
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:34,174
It's too late.

683
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:36,217
It's here.

684
00:35:37,052 --> 00:35:39,271
Well, the good news is
you two finally got what you wanted,

685
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:40,931
you managed to balance
our partnership.

686
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:42,394
We're now all equally dead.

687
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:44,226
Oh, I wouldn't worry about that.

688
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:47,066
This isn't the first scary speedster
that we had to put in its place.

689
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:50,236
MALCOLM: <i>We're gonna get you
out of this bank vault, Eobard.</i>

690
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:51,779
But on one condition.

691
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:54,035
You stop treating us like lackeys.

692
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:59,453
You think you can stop that? Good luck.

693
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:01,242
Was that a yes?

694
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,255
- Yes.
- Great. Let's go to work.

695
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:09,418
All right, so you say this thing
is attracted to the Speed Force?

696
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:11,420
What if you don't use it?

697
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,467
What are you suggesting?

698
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,132
That you stop running.

699
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:32,945
It knows I'm here.

700
00:36:33,108 --> 00:36:35,861
MALCOLM: <i>Good.
'Cause we've only got one shot at this.</i>

701
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:46,877
Remember, as long as you stay still,
he can't sense you.

702
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,148
Easy, Eobard.

703
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:27,333
Easy.

704
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:53,530
It won't stay trapped for long.
We have to go.

705
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:55,402
"We?"

706
00:37:57,192 --> 00:37:58,739
We.

707
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:00,528
Partners.

708
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:02,197
Better.

709
00:38:08,328 --> 00:38:10,831
LILY: Gideon, can you please
take the ship back to Central City?

710
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:12,712
GIDEON: <i>If your goal is to return to 2017,</i>

711
00:38:12,874 --> 00:38:16,344
<i>I'm afraid your father has instructed me
not to permit you to leave the ship.</i>

712
00:38:16,503 --> 00:38:19,598
Well, considering he never wanted
to be my father,

713
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:23,059
that should draw his parental dictates
into question, wouldn't it?

714
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:25,895
You share my fondness for erudition.

715
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:29,895
You truly are my daughter.

716
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:33,437
Well, I am sorry about that.

717
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:36,026
No, I'm... I'm the one who's sorry.

718
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:38,358
For what?

719
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,027
It's not your fault I'm a mistake.

720
00:38:41,361 --> 00:38:43,204
I've made many mistakes in my life, Lily,

721
00:38:43,363 --> 00:38:46,958
but you most certainly
are not one of them.

722
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:51,209
The apology that I owe you
is for not telling you

723
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:54,215
about the unique circumstances
of your conception.

724
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:57,586
You didn't want me to know
that you didn't want me.

725
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:01,422
No.

726
00:39:01,631 --> 00:39:03,304
You're right, I...

727
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:05,218
I didn't want children.

728
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:13,060
But if there's one thing my travels
aboard the <i>Waverider</i> have taught me,

729
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:17,151
it's that time often doesn't provide us
with what we want.

730
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:20,988
But it's quite adept
at giving us what we need.

731
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:26,748
And I needed you in my life.

732
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:33,622
In ways that I could
never even dare to imagine.

733
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:42,965
I just don't want there to be
any more secrets between us.

734
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:47,935
Well, in that spirit,
I suppose I should tell you

735
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:53,476
that I am one-half of a nuclear-powered
superhero called Firestorm.

736
00:39:56,019 --> 00:39:57,942
That is so not funny, Dad.

737
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:04,320
Anyway, as fun as this was,

738
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:07,656
I probably should be getting home.

739
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:10,200
You're sure you can't stay?

740
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:12,164
I... I would, I just...

741
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:15,297
I'm working on a series
of synthetic proteins

742
00:40:15,455 --> 00:40:17,833
that are not going to
fold themselves, so...

743
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:21,173
So, then I guess this is goodbye.

744
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:25,678
Good luck folding those proteins.

745
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:28,222
- Good luck rescuing your friend Rip.
- Hmm.

746
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:36,900
Bye, Dad.

747
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:56,212
DARHK: <i>Feel no pressure to tell us
what all this techno-crap is about.</i>

748
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,839
I'm sure we can figure it out ourselves.

749
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:02,923
This, uh, techno-crap,
as you so eloquently put it,

750
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:05,505
is Captain Hunter's memories.

751
00:41:05,672 --> 00:41:08,892
Including the locations
of the other pieces of the Spear, I hope.

752
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:10,893
That is my working assumption, yes.

753
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:14,431
All we have to do now is upload
his memories to his cerebral cortex.

754
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:17,229
And that's not happening now because...

755
00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:20,646
Well, we'd hardly be doing
Captain Hunter any favors

756
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:23,235
if we just restored the memories
without taking the liberty

757
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:25,150
to redress some of his shortcomings.

758
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,952
What, like stopping him biting his nails?

759
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:31,577
Not exactly.

760
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:48,260
Can I help you with something, soldier?

761
00:41:49,132 --> 00:41:51,430
Uh, no, General Washington. I'm fine.

762
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:54,470
You, on the other hand...
