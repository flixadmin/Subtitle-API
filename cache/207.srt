1
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,180
Nikolai. William's brother.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,700
She's not my girlfriend,
and she's leaving now.

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,840
I wonder how many girls William
will sleep with during Russetiden.

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:16,360
You're going to be sleeping around.
-Then you know more than me.

5
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:20,020
I won't hurt you.
And if you really want to meet my brother..

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,020
.. then I'll introduce you to him.

7
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,900
I don't think it's you Isak has feelings for.

8
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:33,680
Are that Chris and Isak?
Isn't that a little strange?

9
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:44,120
My phone battery is..

10
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:49,680
It's so bad.
-Yeah I know. Same with mine.

11
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:59,180
The Riot Club? Isn't that a bit of a weak concept?
-I don't know.

12
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:07,040
Russ concepts are not really my specialty. 

13
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:12,140
Looks like they had fun at
the release party.

14
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:20,900
What are you looking at?
-Chris' instagram.

15
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,840
I saw something strange yesterday.

16
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:34,680
What?

17
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:42,200
Isak and Penetrator Chris were together.

18
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,280
What? Together how?

19
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:55,760
No. Isak got into the car
of Penetrator Chris.

20
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,180
Are you kidding?
-No!

21
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:04,640
Where was that?
-On the right side of school.

22
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:15,340
Imagine if they're in a relationship!
How crazy would that be?

23
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:21,740
Yeah but you don't have to be in a relationship
if you sit in a car together.

24
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:30,100
It's still a bit weird, you know?
-Because it seemed like they were trying to hide it.

25
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:34,240
Hide what?
-Nothing.

26
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,300
Say it!

27
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:40,920
Hey, tell me Noora.
Hide what?

28
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,120
Huh?
-Nothing!

29
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,940
Did you tell Eskild about Isak?
-No.

30
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,740
Who is Isak?
-No one.

31
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:58,420
Eva, don't start.

32
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:02,940
Don't say anything to Eskild. You don't 
know what he's capable of.

33
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,960
Eva. Eskild

34
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,420
Friends!
She's just pissed.

35
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,040
Don't try to come between us.
It's jealousy.

36
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,020
Eva, say it to Eskild.
Cutie!

37
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,460
I can't hold it in!

38
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,100
Okay, we have a friend
who we think is gay.

39
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,640
Who is it?

40
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,080
Isak.

41
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:35,680
He's always together with a lot of girls
but we found gay porn on his phone.

42
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,960
Eh.. he's gay!

43
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:42,360
Excuse me, you think that everyone's gay Eskild.

44
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,160
I do not.
-You do!

45
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,860
Let me see pictures of him.
Give me some visuals.

46
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,540
I'll find one.

47
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,820
Okay, look at this.

48
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,880
Isakyaki? Okay.

49
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,900
Yeah, he's gay. I chatted with him
on Grindr last week.

50
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,760
Seriously?

51
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,720
I'm messing. He looks sweet thouhg.

52
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,280
Pouty, handsome.

53
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,500
So nice that he's gay!

54
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,500
He isn't gay.
You don't know..

55
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,000
We don't even know if he is.

56
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,760
I'm gonna find out.

57
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,960
Eskild!

58
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,960
You won't find out anything.
You're not a part of this.

59
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:38,740
I can chat with him if I want to.
You don't own Instagram. Jesus!

60
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,280
Do you know what you've started, huh?

61
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:26,040
I have to hurry..
for English.

62
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,000
Can't have more absences. 

63
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,820
Hurry then.

64
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,580
See you after school?

65
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:44,460
Tomorrow. I have bus stuff tonight.

66
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,380
Maybe I can stay at your place.

67
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,780
Okay.

68
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,560
What is it?
-I can't leave now.

69
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,640
I have a hard-on,
so we have to stand here for a bit.

70
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,400
Don't be delicious.

71
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:23,000
It's physically impossible for me
to not be delicious, so..

72
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,940
True.

73
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,680
Say something that will turn me off.

74
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,980
When will I meet your brother?

75
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,660
Before the weekend, maybe.

76
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,780
I got a message from Vilde.

77
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:54,820
She was wondering if you guys could
party on our bus with us on Friday.

78
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,420
Are you keen?

79
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,080
No.

80
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,240
Why not?

81
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:05,820
William, I can't be on that bus
with you and Vilde.

82
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:11,840
Well okay. I have to go.

83
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,660
Don't touch me.

84
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,480
I heard you can get 
chlamydia in your eye.

85
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:34,600
I don't want to..
-Oh, I get it.

86
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,600
I don't want to have 
chlamydia in my mouth.

87
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:44,900
Tell me if you get it,
so we don't spread it.

88
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:49,060
Maybe we have it in our mouths.
-You think so?

89
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,240
I don't know. From Jonas?

90
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,180
Hello!

91
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,840
What is it?

92
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:13,440
Your lipstick is just a bit smudgy.

93
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,680
Oh yeah. I just ate, so..

94
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,620
Ate? Ate what? Dick?

95
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:43,720
Vilde has arranged that we can party on
the Penetrators bus on Friday.

96
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:47,160
The Riot Club.
-To me they'll always be the Penetrators.

97
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,500
We were talking about
who we want to hook up with.

98
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,120
Who do you want to hook up with?

99
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,360
Eh, no one.
-No..

100
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,360
Noora, it just so happens that we get
to go on the bus.

101
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,420
The situation there is a little different.
It's give and take.

102
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,460
<i>[Now Vilde's saying that we're partying
 with you guys. You have to stop it.]</i>
The situation there is a little different.
It's give and take.

103
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,260
<i>[Now Vilde's saying that we're partying
 with you guys. You have to stop it.]</i>

104
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,260
We have to give something back.

105
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,320
Vilde, that's the dumbest
thing I've heard.

106
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,420
There's no need to hook up with anyone.
I don't have to..

107
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:37,840
What about Julian? He's kind of your
type. He's the sweetest.

108
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,620
A little bit.. feminine?

109
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,800
What are you talking
about now, Vilde?

110
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:53,760
I'll fix it. You, Noora Amalie Saætre,
will get hook a up.

111
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:57,460
No, Vilde!
-I'll fix it, okay?

112
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,280
Yeah, so this is my room.

113
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,960
This is your room?
-Yeah.

114
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,280
Nice.

115
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,520
Thanks.

116
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,980
Remember when you said you
wouldn't have sex before you got married?

117
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:14,500
Eh, yes. I remember that.

118
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,360
That was really funny.

119
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:30,160
Yeah, but it wasn't a joke.

120
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,100
No..

121
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,000
No.
-No.

122
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,740
Yeah, same for me.

123
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,600
I think it's cool to wait.

124
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,520
Do you mean that?

125
00:11:59,340 --> 00:11:59,960
No.

126
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,640
Okay..

127
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:16,660
Eskild! You can't just come into my
room whenever it suits you.

128
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,620
Who's that?

129
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:29,860
William. Eskild.
Eskild, William.

130
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,640
William, Eskild.
-I see.

131
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,780
What do you want?

132
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:40,600
I was chatting to that Isak guy.
He's not gay.

133
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,880
Eskild!

134
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,500
What?

135
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:53,700
Is it a secret that he
isn't gay, or what?

136
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,000
Fucking hell.

137
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,220
She's so uptight.
Can you do something about it?

138
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,640
Believe me, I'm trying.

139
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,940
You need dick, Noora. Dick.

140
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,840
Eskild!

141
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,360
<i>[Now I know who you can hook up with.
Maksin! He's so handsome!]</i>

142
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,800
Hey you.

143
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:28,280
Vilde still thinks that we're going
to party on your bus.

144
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,540
And.. you have to stop it.

145
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,000
Yeah but the guys are excited about partying 
with a muslim, so it's still on.

146
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,620
Sana?

147
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,320
Yes.

148
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,220
Why?

149
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,320
Why not?

150
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:56,780
Okay, but you know I can't be on
that bus with you and Vilde.

151
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:01,240
We know this isn't going
to go well.

152
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,280
Then you'll stay home.

153
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,240
<i>[I know I promised you'd meet Nico, but he's gone back 
to Stockholm. You'll meet him in the summer.]</i>

154
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,980
So what exactly did Eskild say?
<i>[I know I promised you'd meet Nico, but he's gone back 
to Stockholm. You'll meet him in the summer.]</i>

155
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,360
<i>[I know I promised you'd meet Nico, but he's gone back 
to Stockholm. You'll meet him in the summer.]</i>

156
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:41,540
He just said that he chatted with him,
and that he really wasn't gay.

157
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,320
How does he know he's gay or not?

158
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:51,900
I don't know. They have their
own language or something?

159
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,460
Did you ask what they talked about?

160
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,240
Eh, no.

161
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:04,820
I was just relieved that Eskild wasn't convinced,
or he would have started stalking him.

162
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,820
There's Chris.

163
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:15,000
Oh my god. They're gonna
talk in secret characters.

164
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,900
Did you see that?

165
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,860
Eh, yes!

166
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,580
That was the call-me sign!

167
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:33,520
That was such an obvious sign!

168
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,740
They're in a relationship.

169
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:43,620
It's not certain that they are.
-It is! What else?

170
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,640
You know what?

171
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:52,960
I will try to hook up with Chris
in the bus on Friday.

172
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:59,520
If he doesn't want to hook up with me,
then I'm convinced.

173
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,740
That's the plan.

174
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:56,480
Noora, this here is Julian.
He has been in Madrid.

175
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,980
She's a virgin.
Virgin!

176
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,460
Hi. Noora.

177
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,700
So you've been in Madrid, huh?
-Yeah.

178
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,380
Noora! Do you know what happened?

179
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:17,300
I hooked up with Chris, and his
phone started ringing.

180
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:21,960
"Isak calling" is what it said on the display.

181
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:26,460
So then he just pulled away.

182
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,840
Fucking hell, really!

183
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,580
What's going on?

184
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,540
Just stay here.

185
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,060
Okay?

186
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,420
Okay..

187
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,260
You promise?

188
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,500
What are you going to do?

189
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,780
Just stay here.

190
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,140
What's going on?

191
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,000
We have to stay here.

192
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,700
It's the Yakuza guys.
