1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,300
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:02,501 --> 00:00:03,701
Father Creel.

3
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:07,505
You have
the Wayne boy?
Not yet.

4
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:09,440
There are some
practical matters

5
00:00:09,477 --> 00:00:11,410
that have to be resolved first.

6
00:00:11,412 --> 00:00:12,578
Whoa!

7
00:00:13,647 --> 00:00:14,913
(gasping)

8
00:00:14,915 --> 00:00:15,748
Mr. Penguin?

9
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,116
Help me.

10
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:18,417
THEO:
This is the name

11
00:00:18,419 --> 00:00:20,352
of the man
who killed your parents.

12
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:21,520
Sell me your company.

13
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:23,722
I will give you this
as a signing gift.

14
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:25,858
I've been a very bad girl.

15
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,292
GORDON: You're a good woman.
You're just sick.

16
00:00:30,064 --> 00:00:31,196
(gasps)

17
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:33,565
I knew you still had
feelings for me.

18
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:34,800
I want to
show you something.

19
00:00:34,802 --> 00:00:35,868
GORDON:
You're under arrest!

20
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:39,738
May I ask what
the charge is?

21
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,206
The kidnapping and torture
of Aubrey James.

22
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,776
No! Tell me who killed them!

23
00:00:44,845 --> 00:00:46,278
Can you believe it still fits?

24
00:00:49,183 --> 00:00:50,616
Don't make me
kill you.

25
00:00:50,618 --> 00:00:52,084
Do it, Jim. Do me.

26
00:00:52,086 --> 00:00:53,585
Kill him!

27
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:56,588
GORDON:
It's over.

28
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:57,723
Not yet.

29
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:01,927
Hold on.

30
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:03,062
I love you, baby.

31
00:01:04,265 --> 00:01:05,798
No!

32
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:10,736
(siren wailing in distance)

33
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:13,072
(thunder rumbling softly)

34
00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:24,650
MAN:
Here you go!

35
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,493
(talking quietly)

36
00:01:42,403 --> 00:01:44,369
(doorbells jingle)

37
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:53,178
Morning.

38
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,180
Help you?

39
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:57,282
I was told to order
a Highsmith Royale.

40
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:58,984
Bit early, don't you think?

41
00:01:58,986 --> 00:02:01,487
I said Highsmith Royale.

42
00:02:01,489 --> 00:02:03,155
No ice.

43
00:02:20,574 --> 00:02:22,541
(lively chatter, music playing)

44
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:32,084
There you go, man.

45
00:02:32,086 --> 00:02:33,886
(man speaking indistinctly
over phone)

46
00:02:43,797 --> 00:02:45,264
How may I help you?

47
00:02:45,266 --> 00:02:47,232
I need somebody killed

48
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:49,401
and I heard
that you employ the best.

49
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:52,337
Oh, yes, I know you.

50
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,540
Our illustrious
mayor's sister.

51
00:02:54,542 --> 00:02:56,875
Or should I say "ex-mayor"?

52
00:02:56,877 --> 00:02:58,610
Word is,
you're quite

53
00:02:58,612 --> 00:03:00,746
the deadeye yourself.

54
00:03:00,748 --> 00:03:02,181
Why come to us?

55
00:03:02,183 --> 00:03:04,349
Had an accident. My aim is off.

56
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,018
Hmm.

57
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,520
Is this business, personal...?

58
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,289
What's it matter to you?

59
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:11,590
Personal costs extra.

60
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:13,225
There's always complications.

61
00:03:13,227 --> 00:03:16,295
It's business.

62
00:03:16,297 --> 00:03:18,530
A cop.

63
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:20,199
Seems personal to me.

64
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:22,968
Anyhow, cops also cost extra.

65
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,770
Fine.

66
00:03:24,772 --> 00:03:26,104
I want it done today.

67
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:30,776
What kind of guarantee do I get?

68
00:03:30,778 --> 00:03:33,779
I accept the job,
the job gets done. Period.

69
00:03:33,781 --> 00:03:36,715
You see, I believe in the
beauty of extreme measures.

70
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,951
So who's the lucky fellow?

71
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:52,898
DOCTOR: Ms. Kean has yet
to regain consciousness.

72
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,133
With this kind of trauma,

73
00:03:55,135 --> 00:04:00,072
we have no idea
when she might wake up.

74
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:03,408
If ever.

75
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,110
But the medical
wing at Arkham

76
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:07,646
is fully equipped
to handle her condition.

77
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,451
Will you be riding
over with her?

78
00:04:12,453 --> 00:04:14,319
No.

79
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,131
Hello, sleepyhead.

80
00:04:27,201 --> 00:04:28,867
(panting)

81
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:30,135
Where am I?

82
00:04:30,137 --> 00:04:31,603
Rapid movement
and elevated heart rate

83
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,605
are counterproductive
to the healing process.

84
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,607
No! No! Don't kill me!

85
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:36,541
Apologies in advance.

86
00:04:44,285 --> 00:04:47,185
Rest up, my feathered friend.

87
00:04:47,187 --> 00:04:50,188
We have a big night ahead of us.

88
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:03,168
Looking for this?

89
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:06,672
Thank you.

90
00:05:06,674 --> 00:05:07,973
You left before I woke up.

91
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:10,242
I know. Couldn't sleep.

92
00:05:10,244 --> 00:05:11,343
Was I snoring?

93
00:05:11,345 --> 00:05:12,811
No.

94
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:13,845
Are you sure?

95
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:15,881
My big, loud, rumbling,
barnyard snore?

96
00:05:15,883 --> 00:05:17,716
I've heard complaints--
neighbors,

97
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:18,817
airplanes...

98
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,819
You don't snore.

99
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,187
Look,

100
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:25,824
I'm glad Galavan's
been arrested,

101
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,060
but he should pay
for everything he's done.

102
00:05:28,062 --> 00:05:30,662
I'm on my way to meet Barnes
at Galavan's penthouse.

103
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:33,098
Hopefully, we can
find some evidence

104
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,100
to corroborate
Aubrey James' testimony.

105
00:05:35,102 --> 00:05:36,234
I got a call.

106
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:38,437
They're transferring
Barbara to Arkham.

107
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:41,406
I know. I stopped by
Gotham General.

108
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:45,877
You went to see her?

109
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:47,012
She's a witness
against Galavan.

110
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:49,047
I wanted to check
on her condition.

111
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:51,350
Her condition is
she's in a coma.

112
00:05:52,953 --> 00:05:54,920
We never talked about
what happened

113
00:05:54,922 --> 00:05:56,755
with you and Barbara
in that interrogation room.

114
00:05:56,757 --> 00:05:58,857
I know. Tonight?

115
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,425
Sure, tonight.

116
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:01,727
Or right now.

117
00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:03,595
Lee, I went over to see her
as a part of

118
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:04,696
the case against Galavan,
that is it.

119
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,531
This isn't jealousy.

120
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,200
That woman is...

121
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:09,701
How do I put this?

122
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:10,869
She's the devil.

123
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,437
No, she is.
She's the devil.

124
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,939
Lee...

125
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:17,109
you think I wanted things
to go the way they did?

126
00:06:17,111 --> 00:06:18,643
I had to play her game.

127
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:19,644
I know.

128
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:20,879
Uh, forget
about Barbara.

129
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:22,948
Most people fight
their dark side.

130
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,617
Lately, you find ways
to give in to it.

131
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:27,953
That's a problem.

132
00:06:27,955 --> 00:06:29,955
For you and for us.

133
00:06:29,957 --> 00:06:31,723
I know.

134
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:34,159
I hear you.

135
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:36,261
Can we please just not
talk about this right now?

136
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:38,263
I'm late to meet Barnes.

137
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:39,598
I'll be fine.

138
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:51,109
I wasn't sure you'd ever
want to see me again.

139
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:54,279
When you called...

140
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:57,582
You don't believe what
they're saying about my uncle...

141
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:58,917
do you?

142
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,352
No.

143
00:07:00,354 --> 00:07:01,520
Of course not.

144
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:05,290
Silver, I asked you here
because I need your help.

145
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:07,092
Anything.

146
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:10,162
Before he was arrested,
your uncle made me an offer.

147
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:12,831
I want...
ALFRED:
Right, Master Bruce!

148
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,166
On your feet.
Bought us a lovely

149
00:07:14,168 --> 00:07:15,333
couple of rakes
from the ironmonger's.

150
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:17,469
I suggest we get
outside and get...

151
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,007
Hello, Ms. St. Cloud.

152
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:25,477
Did not expect to see you here.

153
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:27,112
Hello, Alfred.
That must have been

154
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:29,114
your car I saw,
idling on the main road.

155
00:07:30,384 --> 00:07:31,483
Now, in light of

156
00:07:31,485 --> 00:07:32,818
recent events, I suggest

157
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,519
you get in it and you leave.

158
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:35,520
Immediately.

159
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,491
I invited her,
and I want her to stay.

160
00:07:39,493 --> 00:07:40,959
And I'm ordering her to leave.

161
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,327
And it's my house,
and I give the orders.

162
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:44,229
Oh, is that so?

163
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:46,064
It's okay.

164
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:47,732
I don't want to cause
any trouble.

165
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:48,967
Smart girl.

166
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,570
Off you pop.

167
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:57,042
(whispers):
I'm at the Kane Hotel.

168
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,352
You had no right to do that.

169
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:10,522
I had every right.

170
00:08:10,524 --> 00:08:12,090
What were you thinking,
asking her up here?

171
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:14,392
(door closes in distance)

172
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:16,061
Oh, wait, you...

173
00:08:16,063 --> 00:08:19,731
think she was gonna
tell you something.

174
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:22,200
If Galavan really has the name
of my parents' killer

175
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:23,768
in that envelope,
it's worth a shot.

176
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,036
Well, my guess is

177
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:26,404
there was absolutely nothing
in that envelope.

178
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:28,707
It was just a ruse to get you
to sign away the company.

179
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:31,109
Galavan is smart.

180
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:32,911
He wouldn't enter
a multibillion-dollar offer

181
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:35,447
without his end of the bargain.

182
00:08:35,449 --> 00:08:36,915
He has the name.

183
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:38,049
And you think that little minx

184
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:39,117
is gonna tell you something,
do you?

185
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:41,686
We're friends.

186
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,221
No, you're not.

187
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:45,090
Getting information

188
00:08:45,092 --> 00:08:47,759
out of a girl like that
requires a level of deception

189
00:08:47,761 --> 00:08:50,195
that you do not yet possess,
Master Bruce.

190
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,798
It is too dangerous.

191
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,799
It's worth the risk.

192
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:57,269
No.

193
00:08:57,271 --> 00:09:00,539
You will not see
Ms. St. Cloud again

194
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,240
or pursue Galavan's
wild claims.

195
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:05,043
You have no right
to make that decision for me.

196
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:07,112
Well, someone has to.

197
00:09:07,114 --> 00:09:10,315
If you force me
to be your jailer...

198
00:09:10,317 --> 00:09:12,317
then that is who I will be.

199
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:23,895
(elevator bell dings)

200
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:26,565
(sighs)

201
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:33,238
Excuse me. Thank you.

202
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:36,274
(elevator bell dings)

203
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:38,276
Press 56, please?

204
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:43,448
(muzak playing)

205
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,450
You live here?

206
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,852
No.

207
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:50,155
Me neither.

208
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:53,425
Lady's baby grand
is flat, so...

209
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:54,993
I don't mind
making house calls.

210
00:09:54,995 --> 00:09:57,462
I like my work.

211
00:09:57,464 --> 00:09:58,964
You like your work?

212
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:02,467
Yeah. I do.

213
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:04,469
I guess we're lucky.

214
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:14,346
Caramel?

215
00:10:14,348 --> 00:10:16,715
No, I'm good.

216
00:10:16,717 --> 00:10:18,883
You're missing out;
they're good.

217
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,290
(grunting)

218
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:46,678
Where the hell is Gordon?

219
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,879
(grunting)

220
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,520
(elevator bell dings,
grunting continues)

221
00:10:57,524 --> 00:10:59,024
(elevator bell dings)

222
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:16,074
(panting)

223
00:11:16,076 --> 00:11:17,442
(grunting)

224
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:20,612
Who is that?

225
00:11:20,614 --> 00:11:22,414
No idea.

226
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,749
But he just tried to kill me.

227
00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:27,118
He tell you why?

228
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,687
Wasn't random.

229
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:30,121
Piano wire.

230
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:31,289
Guy's a pro.

231
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:33,792
(phone ringing)

232
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:42,534
(ringing continues)

233
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:44,536
No, wait, wait.

234
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:46,037
(phone beeps)

235
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:50,775
(Gordon breathing)

236
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:00,885
You feeling lucky, Ned?

237
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:01,886
(blows)

238
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:03,655
MAN:
You got this!

239
00:12:03,657 --> 00:12:05,390
(crowd gasps)

240
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:08,827
THE LADY:
Listen up.

241
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:10,495
Who wants a shot
at eighty-sixing

242
00:12:10,497 --> 00:12:11,796
one of Gotham's finest?

243
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,600
I'm waiving
any collateral fines.

244
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:17,635
Just do what you have to do,

245
00:12:17,637 --> 00:12:22,140
but Jim Gordon doesn't see
the sun... rise.

246
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:32,617
(footsteps approaching)

247
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:34,352
(car passing outside)

248
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,859
(gasping softly)

249
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:42,827
You drugged me.

250
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:44,996
That was for your own benefit,
Mr. Penguin.

251
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:46,765
You have extensive injuries.

252
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:49,534
I know you.

253
00:12:49,536 --> 00:12:51,836
Ed.

254
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:53,004
Nygma.

255
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:54,939
We met once before,

256
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:56,207
at the GCPD.

257
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:57,208
You're not a cop.

258
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,209
Oh, no, no, no.

259
00:12:58,211 --> 00:12:59,210
(laughs)

260
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:00,512
No, I'm in forensics.

261
00:13:04,084 --> 00:13:06,117
Do you believe in fate?

262
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,719
Where are my clothes?

263
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:09,354
Oh, I threw them away.
They smelled.

264
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:11,689
Oh, no. Oh, my.

265
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:13,358
Uh, I'm afraid, sir,
that you can't leave.

266
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,560
You sedate me again,
and I swear, I will...

267
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:17,462
Sir!

268
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:18,863
You are a wanted man.

269
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:20,198
You can try and run,

270
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,233
but with your condition,
you'll get about three blocks.

271
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:24,869
I'm afraid that you're
stuck here until you recover.

272
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:33,211
(pants softly)

273
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:34,913
Now, drink up.

274
00:13:34,915 --> 00:13:36,581
It's just water.

275
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,716
Dehydration is common after
prolonged outdoor exposure.

276
00:13:43,924 --> 00:13:45,323
What do you want from me?

277
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:48,226
Remember I had mentioned fate?
(chuckles)

278
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:51,863
Recently,
I've been going through

279
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:53,731
a sort of change.

280
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:56,568
"What kind of change?" you ask.

281
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:57,435
I didn't.

282
00:13:57,437 --> 00:13:59,003
I've started murdering people.

283
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:02,373
(laughs)

284
00:14:06,213 --> 00:14:07,545
Wow!

285
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:10,915
That is thrilling
to say out loud.

286
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:13,751
(laughs)

287
00:14:13,753 --> 00:14:15,753
How many people?

288
00:14:15,755 --> 00:14:17,455
Three in total.
(scoffs, chuckles)

289
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:18,790
Two of them
I didn't really care for.

290
00:14:18,792 --> 00:14:21,926
But one was my girlfriend,
Ms. Kringle.

291
00:14:23,897 --> 00:14:25,864
She was the love of my life.

292
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:27,265
If you're planning on
killing me,

293
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:28,600
could you get
on with it?

294
00:14:28,602 --> 00:14:30,702
At this point, it would
come as a welcome relief.

295
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:33,238
Oh, heavens.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

296
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,473
I have no ill intentions
toward you.

297
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:37,442
Then what are your intentions?

298
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:40,311
I need advice,

299
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:43,414
Mr. Penguin.

300
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:47,318
These murders...

301
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,787
changed me.

302
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:51,789
And like the butterfly,

303
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:54,158
I've come to realize
that I cannot be a caterpillar

304
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,426
once again.

305
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:56,794
And you're one of

306
00:14:56,796 --> 00:14:58,463
the city's
most notorious killers.

307
00:14:58,465 --> 00:15:00,465
I brought you here, in part,

308
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:05,003
because I was hoping you could
guide me on this new path.

309
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:09,073
(laughs)

310
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:10,074
Listen, friend...

311
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,142
Ed.

312
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:15,146
Whatever.

313
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:23,121
(helicopter passing in distance)

314
00:15:23,123 --> 00:15:24,756
My empire is in ruins.

315
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,193
I'm a wanted man
with no friends.

316
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:34,499
And my mother...

317
00:15:34,501 --> 00:15:36,668
the one person
I swore to protect is dead

318
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:39,203
because of my weakness.

319
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:41,372
(inhales sharply)

320
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:43,675
Believe me when I tell you
that this path you're on

321
00:15:43,677 --> 00:15:45,944
leads to nothing
but destruction and pain.

322
00:15:47,914 --> 00:15:51,049
So...

323
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:53,351
wanted or not...

324
00:15:53,353 --> 00:15:54,686
I'm leaving.

325
00:15:58,892 --> 00:16:00,358
(gasps)

326
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:04,629
Oh, my.

327
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:07,899
Rise and shine.

328
00:16:07,901 --> 00:16:09,667
Hell with this.

329
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:10,668
(grunts)

330
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:14,505
Who sent you? Huh?

331
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:16,574
Who sent you?!

332
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:18,076
Your mother.

333
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:20,712
(laughs)

334
00:16:20,714 --> 00:16:22,814
That's what I was hoping
you would say.

335
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:26,250
No! Don't!

336
00:16:26,252 --> 00:16:28,386
(screaming)
Talk!

337
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:30,722
Detective Gordon, stand down!

338
00:16:30,724 --> 00:16:32,090
(screaming)

339
00:16:32,092 --> 00:16:34,392
Stand down right now!

340
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:36,027
Parks, watch the perp.

341
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:37,395
Cortez, you shut
the window.

342
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:39,397
Come over here!

343
00:16:43,203 --> 00:16:45,436
You know damn well I don't
tolerate that type of behavior,

344
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:47,739
and yet you pull that crap
right in front of me?

345
00:16:47,741 --> 00:16:49,507
GORDON:
I'm sorry, sir.

346
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:50,775
BARNES: Are you
losing it, Gordon?

347
00:16:50,777 --> 00:16:53,745
Has that church incident
messed with your mind?

348
00:16:53,747 --> 00:16:54,946
No, sir.

349
00:16:54,948 --> 00:16:56,047
BARNES: 'Cause if I
remember correctly,

350
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:57,281
you disobeying
my orders

351
00:16:57,283 --> 00:16:58,783
is what landed you there
in the first place.

352
00:16:58,785 --> 00:17:01,352
I ordered you to turn
that car around,

353
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:04,022
and you ignored me and drove
straight into an ambush.

354
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:06,424
And ended the day
putting Galavan behind bars.

355
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:08,026
We need to push the boundaries.

356
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:10,695
PARKS:
Captain!

357
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:23,941
(laughing)

358
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:29,447
My employer has
a strict protocol.

359
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:30,982
(laughs)

360
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:36,254
If the first guy
doesn't succeed,

361
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:38,456
keep sending men
till the job is done.

362
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:43,094
None of you is making it
out of here alive.

363
00:17:43,096 --> 00:17:45,129
(laughing)

364
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:56,007
BARNES: When you get
here, move carefully.

365
00:17:56,009 --> 00:17:57,141
We don't know how many

366
00:17:57,143 --> 00:17:58,342
active skells
we're dealing with.

367
00:17:58,344 --> 00:17:59,744
All right.

368
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:01,145
Two units on
the way here.

369
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:02,980
We just have to hold out
till they get here.

370
00:18:02,982 --> 00:18:05,016
Hey, Cortez,
kill the lights.

371
00:18:05,018 --> 00:18:06,617
Sir, I'm forensics.

372
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:07,785
I don't have a gun.

373
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:09,520
Grab something
you can use as a weapon,

374
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:11,756
and stay behind us
as best you can, all right?

375
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:13,091
Parks, take cover

376
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:15,026
behind the desk.

377
00:18:15,028 --> 00:18:16,928
Hey. Remember your training.

378
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,830
Aim for center mass.
Right. Center mass.

379
00:18:18,832 --> 00:18:20,298
And don't stop firing
until you're sure.

380
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,299
And, Parks...

381
00:18:21,301 --> 00:18:22,433
Yes, sir?

382
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:23,768
Breathe.

383
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,670
(exhales)

384
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:28,873
(knocking)

385
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:30,875
(door handle rattling)

386
00:18:38,985 --> 00:18:40,985
(quiet creak)

387
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:49,827
(grunts)

388
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:51,362
CORTEZ:
Help me!

389
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:52,363
Drop the knife!

390
00:18:56,503 --> 00:18:57,902
(grunting)

391
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:02,540
(gunfire)

392
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:15,887
(grunting)

393
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:37,909
I'm leaving.

394
00:19:37,911 --> 00:19:39,911
Not gonna happen.
Try to stop me.

395
00:19:39,913 --> 00:19:42,413
I'll lop off her
pretty little head.

396
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:46,851
You know what I like
about those glasses?

397
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:48,452
(shell casing clatters on floor)

398
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:52,590
They look like bull's-eyes.

399
00:19:54,561 --> 00:19:56,294
Are you okay?
I am.

400
00:19:56,296 --> 00:19:57,962
Okay!

401
00:19:57,964 --> 00:19:59,363
We're not gonna
hang around for round two.

402
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:00,631
Everybody load up,

403
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:02,266
and let's get
the hell out of here.

404
00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:03,401
I'm not leaving.

405
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:05,469
That wasn't a request.

406
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:08,139
This place is still our best bet
for evidence against Galavan.

407
00:20:08,141 --> 00:20:09,574
We leave, they'll destroy it.

408
00:20:09,576 --> 00:20:11,042
Now you're just
looking for a fight.

409
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:15,112
Parks, make sure
the staircase is clear.

410
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,450
I've got a civilian who's dead

411
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:21,819
and a rookie who's scared
half out of her mind.

412
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:23,421
You think we're gonna
survive the next attack

413
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,889
with just a few handguns?

414
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:26,657
We have to get
out of here.

415
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:27,825
(quiet clatter)

416
00:20:28,995 --> 00:20:30,494
Wait.

417
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:37,835
A monk's cassock?

418
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,839
What the hell
is this about?

419
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:43,241
BARNES:
I don't know,

420
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:44,508
but we have to get out of here.

421
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,509
Let's go!

422
00:20:45,511 --> 00:20:46,310
Captain...

423
00:20:46,312 --> 00:20:47,979
Captain!

424
00:20:47,981 --> 00:20:49,981
This could be exactly
what we're looking for.

425
00:20:49,983 --> 00:20:51,115
Knife!

426
00:20:51,117 --> 00:20:52,650
(grunts)

427
00:20:55,188 --> 00:20:57,188
(screams)
Captain!

428
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,923
Captain!
You okay?

429
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:00,291
It's just a scratch.

430
00:21:00,293 --> 00:21:01,492
Let's get out of here.
No, no.

431
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:02,493
(groans)

432
00:21:02,495 --> 00:21:04,328
The knife punctured
an artery.

433
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,097
You move,
it could tear.

434
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:08,165
What are you, a doctor now?
I can move.

435
00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:09,600
(groans)
You stand up,

436
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:11,168
you'll bleed out in
a matter of minutes.

437
00:21:18,144 --> 00:21:20,144
(muffled grunting)

438
00:21:25,418 --> 00:21:27,385
(muffled whimpering)

439
00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:29,820
Ta-da!

440
00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:31,689
(laughs)

441
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:34,458
Who is that?

442
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,294
This is Mr. Leonard.

443
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:37,728
You were talking
in your sleep last night

444
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:39,530
about Galavan
killing your mother.

445
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:40,731
I was?

446
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:42,566
Yes.

447
00:21:42,568 --> 00:21:44,201
Mr. Leonard...

448
00:21:44,203 --> 00:21:45,636
(Leonard whimpers)

449
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:46,871
...works for Galavan.

450
00:21:46,873 --> 00:21:48,572
Well, before he was
arrested, of course.

451
00:21:48,574 --> 00:21:50,408
Arrested?

452
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,076
Detective Gordon
arrested Galavan

453
00:21:52,078 --> 00:21:54,245
for kidnapping
Mayor James.

454
00:21:54,247 --> 00:21:55,713
He's in Blackgate!

455
00:21:55,715 --> 00:21:56,847
(laughing)

456
00:21:56,849 --> 00:21:59,483
Huh.

457
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:00,484
(chuckles)

458
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:03,220
Oh, I thought you'd be pleased.

459
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:09,427
It doesn't matter anymore.

460
00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:11,562
Why is he here?

461
00:22:11,564 --> 00:22:13,731
He was a gift for you.

462
00:22:13,733 --> 00:22:17,401
And what exactly am I supposed
to do with a Leonard?

463
00:22:17,403 --> 00:22:19,203
Kill him.
(muffled grunting)

464
00:22:19,205 --> 00:22:21,505
I thought it might be nice
to get some retribution

465
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:22,907
for your mother's death.

466
00:22:22,909 --> 00:22:24,175
That it might

467
00:22:24,177 --> 00:22:26,110
cheer you up a little.

468
00:22:26,112 --> 00:22:27,111
No?

469
00:22:35,488 --> 00:22:36,787
(muffled whimpering)

470
00:22:55,575 --> 00:22:56,640
I'm done.

471
00:22:58,478 --> 00:23:01,278
I need some rest.

472
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,215
And then I'm leaving
Gotham forever.

473
00:23:11,324 --> 00:23:13,457
I really thought
he would like you.

474
00:23:13,459 --> 00:23:15,126
(muffled grunt)

475
00:23:15,128 --> 00:23:17,128
What to do now?

476
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:19,130
(muffled whimpering)

477
00:23:25,605 --> 00:23:28,239
(Oswald humming a tune)

478
00:23:40,219 --> 00:23:42,186
(muffled screaming)

479
00:23:45,691 --> 00:23:47,691
MAN:
<i>Please! Please!</i>

480
00:23:47,693 --> 00:23:48,692
Not my...!

481
00:23:48,694 --> 00:23:50,361
(blade slices, man screaming)

482
00:23:50,363 --> 00:23:53,130
EDUARDO: Why just smell
the fear on your victim

483
00:23:53,132 --> 00:23:55,433
when you can
taste it, right?

484
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:57,435
(phone ringing,
man continues screaming)

485
00:23:59,405 --> 00:24:01,272
(panting)

486
00:24:01,274 --> 00:24:02,773
Help me!

487
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:05,342
Help! Help!

488
00:24:05,344 --> 00:24:06,844
(screaming)

489
00:24:08,881 --> 00:24:09,847
<i>Hola.</i>

490
00:24:09,849 --> 00:24:11,715
<i>Hola, Eduardo.</i>

491
00:24:11,717 --> 00:24:13,150
Long time.

492
00:24:13,152 --> 00:24:14,618
Yes.

493
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,187
(screaming)

494
00:24:16,189 --> 00:24:18,055
Just a moment, please.

495
00:24:18,057 --> 00:24:20,357
Help! Help!

496
00:24:23,729 --> 00:24:26,330
(chuckles) Are you on a job?

497
00:24:26,332 --> 00:24:28,966
It's not a job
if you love what you do.

498
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:30,734
Oh, fair enough.

499
00:24:30,736 --> 00:24:34,071
Listen, um, I'm in a bit
of a pinch over here.

500
00:24:34,073 --> 00:24:35,639
I thought my membership

501
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:36,807
was revoked.

502
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:38,542
Bygones, darling.

503
00:24:38,544 --> 00:24:40,044
Live and let live.

504
00:24:40,046 --> 00:24:41,245
So you eat people.

505
00:24:41,247 --> 00:24:43,514
Who am I to judge?

506
00:24:43,516 --> 00:24:46,517
The target is
a Detective Gordon.

507
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:48,486
I'll make it worth your while.

508
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:51,722
Send me the address.

509
00:24:51,724 --> 00:24:53,224
(phone beeps)

510
00:25:02,502 --> 00:25:03,534
(groans loudly)

511
00:25:03,536 --> 00:25:05,402
Death squads have
softer touches than you.

512
00:25:05,404 --> 00:25:07,071
(grunting)

513
00:25:11,644 --> 00:25:14,044
At least Galavan
goes top shelf.

514
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:18,249
The EMTs should
be on their way.

515
00:25:18,251 --> 00:25:20,084
Yeah, sure.

516
00:25:20,086 --> 00:25:22,853
They'll be here about
the same time as our backup.

517
00:25:27,393 --> 00:25:31,128
So you want to tell me what
the hell's going on with you?

518
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:36,734
In the church that day,

519
00:25:36,736 --> 00:25:39,270
Barbara accused me
of having a monster inside me.

520
00:25:39,272 --> 00:25:42,039
And?

521
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:43,374
Lee seems to agree.

522
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:45,409
She thinks I'm ready
and willing to give in to it.

523
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:47,111
What do you think?

524
00:25:47,113 --> 00:25:49,213
There was a moment.

525
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:53,217
When I had the shotgun
on Barbara.

526
00:25:53,219 --> 00:25:56,787
She was taunting me
to pull the trigger.

527
00:25:56,789 --> 00:25:59,123
If Galavan's people
hadn't busted in...

528
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:05,563
...I don't know.

529
00:26:05,565 --> 00:26:07,731
But they did bust in.

530
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:08,933
I nearly crossed the line.

531
00:26:08,935 --> 00:26:10,634
"The line."

532
00:26:13,205 --> 00:26:15,973
Let me tell you something
about the line.

533
00:26:15,975 --> 00:26:19,476
My third tour, we were
stationed in the desert.

534
00:26:19,478 --> 00:26:23,314
We captured three insurgents,
when this sandstorm kicks up.

535
00:26:23,316 --> 00:26:25,983
Zero visibility.

536
00:26:25,985 --> 00:26:28,419
Then we start taking fire.
We're getting lit up.

537
00:26:28,421 --> 00:26:30,421
Suddenly, I'm alone.

538
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:32,790
I come across
one of our prisoners.

539
00:26:32,792 --> 00:26:34,458
He's a kid.

540
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,961
His hands are zip-tied.

541
00:26:36,963 --> 00:26:39,930
But he figures, what the hell,
he's gonna use the sandstorm

542
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:41,298
to try to escape.

543
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,133
So I jump him.

544
00:26:43,135 --> 00:26:47,004
And I take my gun
and I jam it in his mouth.

545
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:51,775
I figured
it was just a threat.

546
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:54,211
Show him who's boss,
you know?

547
00:26:54,213 --> 00:26:56,547
Next thing I know...

548
00:26:58,584 --> 00:27:00,951
...I just pulled the trigger.

549
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:04,888
Blew his head off.

550
00:27:10,096 --> 00:27:12,062
(panting)

551
00:27:15,735 --> 00:27:18,702
That kid woke me up
every night for years.

552
00:27:20,906 --> 00:27:22,873
Until I made my peace with him.

553
00:27:25,645 --> 00:27:28,846
See, I come to find out
I'm just a man.

554
00:27:28,848 --> 00:27:32,249
And at the right moment,

555
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:34,418
a man might do anything.

556
00:27:36,455 --> 00:27:38,055
Any man.

557
00:27:40,026 --> 00:27:42,593
There is no line.

558
00:27:42,595 --> 00:27:44,428
There's just the law.

559
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:47,865
That's what separates us
from the animals.

560
00:27:47,867 --> 00:27:51,168
There is no line.

561
00:27:58,144 --> 00:27:59,677
Alfred?

562
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,750
I thought about what you said.

563
00:28:06,752 --> 00:28:08,919
And you're right.

564
00:28:08,921 --> 00:28:11,288
Pursuing Galavan on my own
is too risky.

565
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:13,223
Well, you don't say.

566
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:14,425
Best course of action

567
00:28:14,427 --> 00:28:16,427
is call Detective Gordon
in the morning.

568
00:28:16,429 --> 00:28:17,594
Enlist his help.

569
00:28:17,596 --> 00:28:20,030
At last, some sense.

570
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:23,534
You're thinking of retiring,
are you, sir?

571
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:26,603
Yeah, yeah. Very tired.

572
00:28:26,605 --> 00:28:28,739
Right, can I get you anything
to eat before you go to bed?

573
00:28:28,741 --> 00:28:30,107
No.

574
00:28:30,109 --> 00:28:31,375
No, thank you, Alfred.

575
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:34,278
Right, well, sleep well.
Oh, and, uh, Master Bruce?

576
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,780
I sent that car off that's
parked at the end of the lane.

577
00:28:36,782 --> 00:28:37,981
You know, the taxi.

578
00:28:37,983 --> 00:28:40,651
Don't worry, I gave
him a right good tip.

579
00:28:40,653 --> 00:28:45,322
I mean, after all, he did drive
all the way up here, didn't he?

580
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:47,658
I didn't call a taxi.

581
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:50,427
You really are the most...

582
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:52,563
terrible liar, aren't
you, Master Bruce?

583
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:59,670
I will not stop
pursuing this, Alfred.

584
00:28:59,672 --> 00:29:01,438
I'm never
going to give up.

585
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,806
And nor will I.

586
00:29:05,511 --> 00:29:08,112
Good night, sir.

587
00:29:08,114 --> 00:29:09,279
(groans)

588
00:29:14,286 --> 00:29:19,423
WOMAN (over recording):
♪ The fire has gone out ♪

589
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:23,627
♪ Wet from snow above ♪

590
00:29:23,629 --> 00:29:28,165
NYGMA (singing along): ♪ But
nothing will warm me more ♪

591
00:29:28,167 --> 00:29:34,505
♪ Than my, my mother's love ♪

592
00:29:34,507 --> 00:29:39,276
♪ I light another candle ♪

593
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:43,847
♪ To dry the tears
from my face... ♪

594
00:29:43,849 --> 00:29:45,849
Why are you
playing this song?

595
00:29:45,851 --> 00:29:48,285
(woman continues singing
over recording)

596
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:50,287
I can bring tears
to your eyes

597
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:52,389
and resurrect the dead.

598
00:29:52,391 --> 00:29:55,559
I form in an instant
and last a lifetime.

599
00:29:55,561 --> 00:29:57,294
What am I?

600
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:58,695
A memory.

601
00:29:58,697 --> 00:30:00,063
So what?

602
00:30:00,065 --> 00:30:03,066
You were humming this
under your covers.

603
00:30:03,068 --> 00:30:04,968
I figure it has meaning for you.

604
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,970
(chuckles softly)

605
00:30:09,508 --> 00:30:12,176
(sniffles)

606
00:30:12,178 --> 00:30:14,311
Every night when I was young,

607
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:16,380
my mother would sing
that song to me

608
00:30:16,382 --> 00:30:18,816
when I was
going to bed.

609
00:30:18,818 --> 00:30:22,419
And every time,
she would tell me...

610
00:30:22,421 --> 00:30:24,221
(music fades,
helicopter passing in distance)

611
00:30:24,223 --> 00:30:26,223
"Oswald...

612
00:30:30,696 --> 00:30:34,531
"...don't listen
to the other children.

613
00:30:34,533 --> 00:30:38,035
"You're handsome and clever.

614
00:30:39,705 --> 00:30:41,772
And some day,
you will be a great man."

615
00:30:41,774 --> 00:30:44,775
(both chuckle softly)

616
00:30:44,777 --> 00:30:48,512
She said that every time.

617
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:50,914
(sniffles)

618
00:30:50,916 --> 00:30:53,083
That's all I
have left now.

619
00:30:53,085 --> 00:30:55,552
Memories.

620
00:30:55,554 --> 00:30:58,188
And they're like
daggers in my heart.

621
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,757
Not forever.

622
00:31:02,862 --> 00:31:06,630
These were Ms. Kringle's.

623
00:31:06,632 --> 00:31:09,433
It's all I have left
to remember her by.

624
00:31:09,435 --> 00:31:12,970
But when I look at these,
I don't feel sadness anymore.

625
00:31:12,972 --> 00:31:15,439
I feel gratitude.
And do you know why?

626
00:31:15,441 --> 00:31:18,909
No. And I don't care.

627
00:31:18,911 --> 00:31:20,911
This little
visit is over.

628
00:31:22,915 --> 00:31:25,082
I will just
simply bid you

629
00:31:25,084 --> 00:31:27,217
adieu.

630
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:30,120
Mr. Penguin.

631
00:31:31,924 --> 00:31:35,092
For some men, love is
a source of strength.

632
00:31:35,094 --> 00:31:36,827
But for you and I,
it will always be

633
00:31:36,829 --> 00:31:38,061
our most crippling weakness.

634
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:40,163
Move aside, Ed!

635
00:31:40,165 --> 00:31:41,832
We are better off unencumbered.

636
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:46,737
What did you say?

637
00:31:46,739 --> 00:31:49,172
You said it yourself.

638
00:31:49,174 --> 00:31:54,244
Your mother is dead
because of your weakness.

639
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:57,948
But what you need to realize
is that your weakness

640
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:59,983
was her.

641
00:32:01,387 --> 00:32:02,619
(grunts)

642
00:32:02,621 --> 00:32:05,355
My mother was a saint!

643
00:32:05,357 --> 00:32:07,491
The only person who
truly cared about me,

644
00:32:07,493 --> 00:32:09,660
and now she's gone!

645
00:32:09,662 --> 00:32:11,328
And I have nothing left!

646
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:14,131
A man with nothing
that he loves...

647
00:32:16,969 --> 00:32:18,969
...is a man
who cannot be bargained.

648
00:32:18,971 --> 00:32:22,506
A man that cannot be
betrayed.

649
00:32:22,508 --> 00:32:25,175
A man who answers to no one...

650
00:32:25,177 --> 00:32:26,543
but himself.

651
00:32:26,545 --> 00:32:31,815
And that is the man
that I see before me.

652
00:32:34,153 --> 00:32:36,853
A free man.

653
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:59,576
(sirens wailing)

654
00:32:59,578 --> 00:33:01,745
GORDON (over radio):
Are the EMTs with you?

655
00:33:01,747 --> 00:33:03,380
Captain Barnes needs
immediate attention.

656
00:33:03,382 --> 00:33:04,915
Ambulance is
still inbound.

657
00:33:04,917 --> 00:33:07,751
We'll secure the perimeter...
Wait, wait, hold on!

658
00:33:07,753 --> 00:33:09,019
OFFICER 2:
Behind you!

659
00:33:09,021 --> 00:33:10,153
(gunfire over phone)
Officer?

660
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:11,221
(shouting)

661
00:33:11,223 --> 00:33:12,389
Officer?!

662
00:33:12,391 --> 00:33:14,391
(gunfire, screaming)

663
00:33:15,761 --> 00:33:18,328
EDUARDO:
<i>Hola.</i>

664
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,830
Detective Gordon, I presume?

665
00:33:19,832 --> 00:33:21,565
Who is this?

666
00:33:21,567 --> 00:33:23,000
This is Eduardo Flamingo.

667
00:33:23,002 --> 00:33:25,502
Is that name supposed to mean
something to me?

668
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,837
