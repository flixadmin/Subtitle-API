622
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:24,404
If you ever need anything,
I will race over in a heartbeat.

623
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:26,990
Same. Well, as fast as I can run.

624
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:29,534
Which may take me a while,
but I will still come.

625
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:39,335
Bye, Felicity.

626
00:39:59,856 --> 00:40:01,691
Bye, Barry.

627
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:04,027
BARRY:
Whoo-hoo!

628
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:13,202
SNART: I know it's been a while
since we pulled that job.

629
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:16,414
I know it didn't go so well for you.

630
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:19,709
And I know I said we were finished,
but things have changed.

631
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:24,172
If I wanna keep working in Central City,
I'm gonna need a new kind of crew.

632
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:26,716
I'm gonna need someone like you.

633
00:40:26,883 --> 00:40:31,137
You're tolerant of extremes,
you have certain skills.

634
00:40:31,304 --> 00:40:34,140
You just need some direction.

635
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:37,810
And I can give that to you.

636
00:40:38,728 --> 00:40:41,064
You still like playing with fire?

637
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:43,149
You're gonna love this.

638
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:45,735
So...

639
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:49,238
...are you in, Mick, or are you out?

640
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:50,907
[MICK CHUCKLES]

641
00:40:51,074 --> 00:40:53,451
MICK:
Yeah, buddy, I'm in.
