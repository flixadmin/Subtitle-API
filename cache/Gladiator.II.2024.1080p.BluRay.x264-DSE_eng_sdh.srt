Emperor Geta.

Emperor Caracalla.

183
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:39,240
General Acacius.

184
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:42,330
I have taken Numidia
in your names

185
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,240
that your dominion
may eclipse that

186
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,510
of every emperor
that came before you.

187
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,120
Crown him with laurels, brother.

[monkey hooting softly]

191
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:08,700
[Geta] In honor
of your conquest,

192
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,790
there will be games
in the Colosseum.

193
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:15,580
I require no games
in my honor.

194
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:19,190
Serving the Senate
and the people of Rome

195
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:21,020
is honor enough for me.

196
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:23,890
You are too modest,
Acacius.

197
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:27,160
It does not suit a general
as accomplished as yourself.

198
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:32,160
The glory is yours,
not mine.

199
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:35,340
I only ask for
some respite from war

200
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:36,950
to spend time
with my wife.

201
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,470
Your wife, yes. [sniffs]

202
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:41,210
Remember the privileges
we have granted her?

[sword scraping]

204
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:44,870
Where is she now
to ignore such an occasion?

205
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,700
There are victories
yet still to come.

206
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,880
Persia.

207
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:53,140
India.

[chuckles]

209
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:58,010
Both... must be conquered.

210
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:02,450
Rome has so many subjects.

211
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:04,500
She must feed them.

212
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,980
They can eat war.
[laughs]

213
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,990
Your triumphs
will be celebrated

214
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:17,250
as a tribute
to the greatness

215
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:19,340

of the conquered enemies
of Rome:

The barbarian Numidians

To the wall.

[trainer] The arena

For the bravest of you,

the road to glory
runs through the arena.

273
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,400
The arena turns slaves
into gladiators

274
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:24,400
and gladiators into free men.

275

You have worms.

Hanno, get up.

What is
your native language?
I speak them all.

289

You don't answer because
you can't or because you won't?

290
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,730
Mm, all right.

291
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:26,610
Violence...
is the universal language.

292
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:29,390
Viggo,
put him through his paces.

293
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:33,350
He can fight an ape.
Let's see if he
can fight a man.

Very good.

305
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,350
Hose him down.

You will do well.

315
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:27,820
It is an art,

316
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:29,820
choosing gladiators.

317
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,470
Some choose entertainers.

318
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:35,610
Some choose brute force.

319
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,220
I choose rage.

320

[Macrinus chuckles]

Crowd loves blood.

322
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,050
And they love those who
love blood as much as they do.

323
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:47,620
And you, my friend, rage

324
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,580
pours out of you like...

325
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:53,580
like milk...

326
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,500
from a whore's tit.

327
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:59,240
You will be
quite the fighter.

328
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:00,890
Not for you.

329
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:03,070
You're right,
you do not fight for me.

330
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,510
I put you in the ring,
you fight or you die.

331
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,770
The choice is yours.

332
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:09,810
But whose head
could I give you

333
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:13,510
that would satisfy this fury?

334
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:15,520
The entire Roman Army's.

335
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:17,690
[hearty laugh]

336
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,130
Too much.

337
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,830
Mm.

338
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
The general will do.

339
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,090
General?

340
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:28,440
- General Acacius?
- Mm.

341
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,320
Use your rage
in my service,

342
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:37,230
and you will have his head
ready for your sword.

343
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:41,540
Serve me and I will serve you.
Deny me...

344
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:45,420
and you will die.

345
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:47,420
[thunder rumbles
in distance]

346
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:50,160
There are times I wished
you'd abandoned me

347
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:52,030
rather than
fight their wars.

348
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,160
I've made my choice.

349
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:58,080
I can live with it.

350
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:05,130
But my patience with those two
is at an end.

351
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,090
Leta?

352
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:13,700
You may go
to your quarters now.
We need nothing more.

353
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:22,450
To hear wives and mothers
mourning their dead

354
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:24,280
on that beach at Numidia...

355
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:28,460
Lucilla.

356
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,070
No more.

357
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:39,560
I will not waste

358
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:43,210
another generation
of young men for their vanity.

359
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,960
If I fight another campaign,
it must be to depose them.

360
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,960
When will your troops
arrive?

361
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:56,090
They land at Ostia
in ten days.

362
00:37:56,270 --> 00:38:00,190
How many of them will be
loyal to you alone?

363
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,230
All of them.

364
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:08,890
The emperors do not have
the support of the people.

365
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:13,720
The people are weary
of the madness, the tyranny.

366
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,680
[sighs]

367
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:20,860
What is the dream of Rome
if her people are not free?

everyone,

00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,800
to excess!

374
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:50,850
Thank you. Thank you.

Oh!

00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:07,910
[laughs] Please, drink.

378
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,870
Ah! Excuse me. Macrinus!

379
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:14,830
I knew the provinces
were not enough for you.

380
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,090
I'm just here
- for the games.
- Ah, well,

381
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,790
you won't be disappointed.

382
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:23,090
Rome has all the games
that men like you like to play.

383
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:25,450
Men like me, Thraex?
Men like us.

384
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:29,010
I know nothing happens
in Rome unless you've
tasted it first.

[both laughing]

386
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,160
What is my purpose here?

387
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,690
You'll find out soon enough.

388
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:55,480
What's this we hear
about you being interested

389
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:59,260
in standing for election
to the Senate, Macrinus?

390
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,870
Me? No, I'm, uh...

391
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:04,440
I don't even know how
to use an abacus.

392
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:06,310
But I do understand that

393
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:08,840
it's customary
for your guests

394
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:11,530
to make wagers
at these affairs?

395
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:13,880
How large a sum
did you have in mind?

396
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:16,930
A thousand gold denarii?

397
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:18,410
Two.

398
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:21,540
Two?

Lords, ladies and gentlemen,

- This is your gladiator?
- It is.

[Thraex] Three rounds,
hand to hand.

Swords!

415

We want swords.
A fight to the death.

416
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:32,570
No quarter to be offered...
or given.

From where do you hail?

Speak.

I said speak.

He is from the colonies,
Your Majesty.

446
00:43:50,970 --> 00:43:52,840
to come back from hell

and view the cheerful skies,

I've grown so bored,
but you surprise me.

To amuse you is my only wish.

A captured Roman officer.

470
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:22,370
I was posted guard over him
and he used to tell us tales

00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:24,370
to pass the time.

472
00:45:25,370 --> 00:45:26,500

Oh, we ate him.

As barbarians do.

[chuckling]
As barbarians do.

And where were you born?

477
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:37,430
Why does my past matter
if it is my future

Tell me what use have I
for Roman money.

480

A gladiator

can buy his own freedom.

His liberty.[chuckles]

No, the slave dreams
not of freedom

but of a slave
to call his own.

Is that what you were
raised on, Macrinus?

What did you have to do
for Roman money?

489

You promised me a head.

490

and you can have
anyone's head.

Better times will come.

And why are we here?

501
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:25,930
[Acacius]
To take back the city.

And restore Rome
to where she should be.

503

Five thousand soldiers
loyal to me...

00:47:46,470 --> 00:47:48,770
will enter Rome
and then the Colosseum,

508
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:50,780
where they will
arrest the emperors

509

for their crimes
against the Senate

00:47:55,960 --> 00:48:00,870
Uh, this plan
is ambitious and risky.

512
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:03,700
Rome will be yours
to administer and to--

513
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:08,450
Marcus Aurelius talked
of restoring power
to the Senate,

514
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:12,840
but that was a generation ago.
Much has changed.

515
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:16,850
The people
have not seen hope

516
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:18,330
for many years.

517
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:22,070
But with time...
and guidance...

518
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,630
[sighs sharply]

519
00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:27,120
Lucilla, you are the daughter
of Marcus Aurelius.

520
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:29,290
He had my loyalty.

521
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:32,990
And so do you.

522
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:36,780
Senator Thraex?

523
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:41,910
Politics follows power,
my lady.

524
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:46,050
Take back
what is rightfully yours...

525
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:49,100
and the Senate
will support you.

526
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:51,400
Thank you.

527
00:49:07,550 --> 00:49:08,940
Food! Food!

528
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:15,900
When I was told of this place,

529
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:18,210
they never mentioned
the stink.

530
00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:21,340
That would be Hanno.

531
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:24,610
[laughter]

532
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:27,480
Well, you'll have to
put up with me as I am.

533
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:29,050
[laughing]

534
00:49:32,790 --> 00:49:35,840
And what's that up there?
A wolf?

535
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:40,760
The twins there,
they were outcasts.

536
00:49:40,930 --> 00:49:42,580
Left in the hills to die.

537
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:47,720
That wolf found them
and she suckled them
on her milk.

538
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:51,290
Raised by an animal.
It's in their blood.

539
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:54,250
How do you know this place?

540
00:49:55,470 --> 00:49:57,420
I know the chaos
they brought.

541
00:49:58,730 --> 00:50:01,430
This city infects
everything it touches.

542
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,600
I never dreamt
it would be so big.

543
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:05,430
Don't fall for it.

544
00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:07,560
This city is diseased.

545
00:50:08,910 --> 00:50:11,000
[peasants] Food! Food!

546
00:50:13,530 --> 00:50:15,960

551
00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:45,120
[woman] Help me.
Please, help me!

00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:49,300

[crows squawking]

555
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:23,160
- Ah!
- Thraex.

556
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:27,990
About our wager.

557
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:29,860
Ah. The barbarian.

558
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:31,260
Yes, I haven't forgotten,
I always repay my debts.

559
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:33,220
I was merely
going to suggest

560
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:35,260
that perhaps your luck
might change.

561
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,790
Shall we say
double or quits?

562
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:43,440
- Ah.
- Ah.

563
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:45,530
[both laughing]

Line up! Line up!

Emperor Caracalla.

[crowd cheering]

576
00:53:16,930 --> 00:53:19,930
These sacred games

577
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:23,240
are held to honor
the victory of Rome

578
00:53:23,410 --> 00:53:26,420
over the barbarians of Numidia.

Rome's legionary commander,

General Justus Acacius!

00:53:41,870 --> 00:53:43,260

00:54:14,510 --> 00:54:15,460
Speak to them.

00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:18,030
[man faintly]
Speak to us!

595
00:54:23,470 --> 00:54:26,130
[cheering ebbs]

596
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:29,000
I am not an orator

597
00:54:29,170 --> 00:54:30,700
or a politician.

598
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,610
I am a soldier.

599
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:41,320
I have seen bravery
in men and women during war.

600
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:43,840
And even once in this arena.

601
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:47,100
So if you ask anything
of the gods...

602
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:51,370
ask for that same bravery.

603
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:55,810
Because Rome needs it now.

681
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:04,720
The road to freedom
doesn't run
through the arena.

682
01:02:05,540 --> 01:02:07,070
It leads to this.

683
01:02:11,590 --> 01:02:13,510
Go to your cells.

684
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:17,250
[all cheering, clapping]

685
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:20,910
Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

686
01:02:23,390 --> 01:02:25,170

[dog whimpers]

688
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:39,190
Come on, let's go.

689
01:02:52,460 --> 01:02:55,680
"Gates of hell
are open night and day.

690

[voice wavering]
Smooth is the descent...

691
01:02:58,470 --> 01:03:00,340
[crying]
...easy is the way."

692
01:03:04,470 --> 01:03:06,780
[boy]
There, there, there, there.

693
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:08,210
And I've got you.

694
01:03:08,390 --> 01:03:10,960
I'm Maximus,
the savior of Rome!

695
01:03:30,580 --> 01:03:32,590
Scatto and Argento.

696
01:03:34,810 --> 01:03:37,500
[people cheer, echoing]

697
01:03:40,940 --> 01:03:42,680
[gasping softly]

698
01:03:46,340 --> 01:03:47,690
Lucius is safe?

699
01:04:05,530 --> 01:04:06,580
[Lucilla] Lucius!

700
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:18,460
[horse whinnies]

701
01:04:19,290 --> 01:04:21,110
[Lucilla] Lucius,

702
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:24,200
you're the sole heir
to the throne now.

703
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:27,250
There are men
who want to kill you

704
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:28,860
so they can take power.

705
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:33,730
I promise I'll bring you back
as soon as it's safe.

706
01:04:33,910 --> 01:04:37,430
Mother, why can't you
come with me?

707
01:04:37,610 --> 01:04:39,960
[crying] I... I have to
stay here for your sake.

708
01:04:40,130 --> 01:04:42,050
[sniffles]
And for the sake of Rome.

709
01:04:42,220 --> 01:04:44,610
Remember who you are.

710
01:04:44,790 --> 01:04:46,660
And that I love you.

711
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:48,750
I love you.

712
01:04:49,660 --> 01:04:50,710
[man] Come.

713
01:04:53,970 --> 01:04:55,320
Give me your leg.

714
01:04:57,190 --> 01:04:58,850
Go. Go!

715
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:00,370
[horse whinnies]

716
01:05:05,590 --> 01:05:07,070
[doctor] So...

717
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:09,680
[Hanno grunts]

718
01:05:10,420 --> 01:05:11,860
What's your name?

719
01:05:13,510 --> 01:05:14,510
[exhales]

720
01:05:14,690 --> 01:05:17,210
I'm Ravi. I'm a doctor.

721
01:05:18,470 --> 01:05:21,910
Because... more men die
of infected wounds

722
01:05:22,090 --> 01:05:24,610
than out there, in the arena.

723
01:05:26,050 --> 01:05:28,830
This needs to be cleaned,
it needs to be stitched and

724
01:05:29,010 --> 01:05:31,570
[exclaims softly]
it is going to hurt.

725
01:05:31,750 --> 01:05:32,880
Mm.

726
01:05:33,050 --> 01:05:36,060
This is Devil's Breath
and opium.

727
01:05:36,710 --> 01:05:38,190
It's for the pain.

728
01:05:39,190 --> 01:05:40,890
You should breathe in.

729
01:05:42,150 --> 01:05:43,020
[inhales sharply,
grunts]

730

[deep inhale]

731
01:05:46,890 --> 01:05:48,330
[Ravi] I've been here
so long now,

732
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:50,900
I don't even notice anymore.

733
01:05:51,070 --> 01:05:53,770
I've done more amputations
than I can count.

734
01:05:54,990 --> 01:05:57,510
Where'd you
- learn your trade?
- Why do you ask?

735
01:05:57,690 --> 01:05:59,300
You've got a heavy hand.

736
01:06:00,730 --> 01:06:02,130
I used to be
a gladiator myself.

737
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:03,610
Ah.

738
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:05,780
And would you have bested me?[Ravi chuckles]

739
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:07,440
In your prime, of course.

740
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:11,270
In your current state,
I could best you now.

741
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:12,960
[laughs]

742
01:06:13,140 --> 01:06:16,270
Luckily for you,
I have put down my sword.

743
01:06:16,450 --> 01:06:18,580
So now I spend my days[groaning]

744
01:06:18,750 --> 01:06:21,230
saving lives
instead of taking them.

745
01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:22,670
[inhales, grunts]

746
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:25,280
And why such a change
so late in life?

747
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:28,330
What we do in life

748
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:30,850
echoes in eternity.

749
01:06:31,030 --> 01:06:32,850
[panting softly]

750
01:06:34,590 --> 01:06:36,160
I feel like
I know those words.

751
01:06:36,340 --> 01:06:38,820
[Ravi chuckles]
I can't take credit.

752
01:06:38,990 --> 01:06:41,470
It's written on
one of the tombs.

753
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:44,260
Over the bones of a gladiator.

754
01:06:44,430 --> 01:06:45,650
[sharp grunt of pain][Macrinus] My champion!

755
01:06:45,820 --> 01:06:47,910
I smell Devil's Breath!

01:06:48,090 --> 01:06:50,260
[laughing]

757
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:53,790
My... champion.

758
01:06:54,790 --> 01:06:56,490
Did you hear that crowd?

759
01:06:59,530 --> 01:07:01,710
- Did you hear that crowd?
- Mm-hm.

760
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:05,800
You have something.
I knew it from the start.

761
01:07:05,970 --> 01:07:09,800
- Did you now?
- Yes. The Greeks call it...

762
01:07:10,590 --> 01:07:12,070
thymos.

763
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:13,550
Smoke.

764
01:07:14,290 --> 01:07:15,640
Rage.

765
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:18,680
That rage is your gift.

766
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:22,120
Like the great Achilles.

767
01:07:22,290 --> 01:07:24,560
Never let it go.

768
01:07:24,730 --> 01:07:27,470
It will carry you
to greatness,

769
01:07:27,650 --> 01:07:29,430
my champion.

[horses whinny, snort]

01:07:48,890 --> 01:07:50,890
Thank you

772
01:07:51,060 --> 01:07:52,930
for inviting me.

773
01:07:53,110 --> 01:07:55,070
This is truly an honor.

774
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:02,030
I hear you are
the talk of the court.

775
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:03,470
[kissing hand]

776
01:08:04,420 --> 01:08:05,420
Yes.

777
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:07,770
We've met before.

778
01:08:08,510 --> 01:08:10,520
- Have we?
- Long ago.

779
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,520
Where?

780
01:08:13,690 --> 01:08:15,520
I was in the service
of your father's army

781
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:17,700
on his African campaign.

782
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:20,960
You served
with my father?

783
01:08:21,530 --> 01:08:23,180
[groaning]

784
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:25,790
Mm.

785
01:08:26,490 --> 01:08:28,490
I had the privilege

786
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:31,060
of reading
his "Meditations."

787
01:08:31,230 --> 01:08:32,450
Mm.

788
01:08:35,450 --> 01:08:37,370
"The best revenge

789
01:08:38,540 --> 01:08:41,760
is to be unlike him
who performed the injury."

790
01:08:44,070 --> 01:08:46,550
I hear you've been
arming half the legions

791
01:08:46,730 --> 01:08:51,730
in the entire empire,
and here, now, in Rome...

792
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:55,950
you're gaining influence
by sponsoring gladiators.

793
01:08:56,130 --> 01:08:58,130
I do it for the love
of the sport.

794
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:01,260
And where did you find
these gladiators?

795
01:09:02,260 --> 01:09:05,010
They're usually
prisoners of war.

796
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:09,360
Or vagrants.
Why do you ask?

797
01:09:09,530 --> 01:09:12,230
A man can choose to fight...

798
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:15,760
and stay alive.

799
01:09:15,930 --> 01:09:19,020
It's the same in life as it is
in the arena, is it not?

800
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:23,070
Who is this?

801
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:25,590
That is my father
as a youth.

802
01:09:28,810 --> 01:09:29,990
[Macrinus]
She had a child?

803
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:31,860
Mm. [swallows]

804
01:09:32,030 --> 01:09:34,340
It's common knowledge.
When Commodus was killed,

805
01:09:34,510 --> 01:09:36,250
- the boy disappeared.
- Mm.

806
01:09:36,430 --> 01:09:38,390
- But who would care?
- Lucilla would care.

- More wine!
- More wine!

808
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:46,050
He was of the royal bloodline,
after all.

809
01:09:47,790 --> 01:09:49,050
And his father?

810

[senator] Ostensibly,
Lucius Verus.

811
01:09:54,050 --> 01:09:55,710
See, it was
an arranged marriage.

812
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:56,930
She was 14.

813
01:09:57,100 --> 01:10:00,370
- Mm.
- Females were not his taste.

814
01:10:00,540 --> 01:10:01,800
- Nor mine, some days.
- Nor yours!

[both laugh]

816
01:10:03,590 --> 01:10:07,720
No, no, no.
By rumor, you see,
she took lovers.

817
01:10:07,890 --> 01:10:12,030
And by rumor,
the real father...
was Commodus.

818
01:10:13,030 --> 01:10:15,380
Brotherly love,
- you see?
- Yeah.

819
01:10:15,550 --> 01:10:17,210
If he died,

820
01:10:18,250 --> 01:10:20,600
- there has to be remains.
- Mm.

821
01:10:20,780 --> 01:10:24,040
And if he lived,
that would make him about...

822
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:26,220
Um, well,
let's work it out.

823
01:10:26,390 --> 01:10:29,700
He was about 12
- when he died?
- Yes.

824
01:10:29,870 --> 01:10:34,140
So that would make him...

01:11:36,850 --> 01:11:37,810
do you know me?

833
01:11:46,250 --> 01:11:47,560
Do you have a family?

834
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:53,300
A wife. Arishat.

835
01:11:54,870 --> 01:11:56,260
Arishat.

836
01:11:56,440 --> 01:11:59,610
She was killed
under your husband's command.

in its own blood.

And yet you enjoy
the pleasures of the Colosseum.

or none that I can remember.

845
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:32,600
[sniffles]

846
01:12:34,690 --> 01:12:36,650
[crying] I'm so sorry.

847
01:12:36,830 --> 01:12:38,830
If your son were here,
I feel sure he would tell you

848
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,830
not to grieve him.

849
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,660
For he would not be the boy
that you sent away.

850
01:12:42,830 --> 01:12:44,790
That boy is dead.

851
01:12:47,230 --> 01:12:49,320
You may think
I have little worth.

852
01:12:50,970 --> 01:12:52,970
You may think
I betrayed you.

853
01:12:54,970 --> 01:12:56,720
But I need you to know...

854
01:12:58,190 --> 01:13:01,070
if you will not have
your mother's love,

855
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:04,070
then take
your father's strength.

856
01:13:05,290 --> 01:13:06,640
You need it.

857
01:13:08,990 --> 01:13:13,170
His name was
Maximus Decimus Meridius.

858
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:15,950
And I see him in you.

859
01:13:16,130 --> 01:13:17,480
Get out.

860
01:13:19,650 --> 01:13:22,090
[Gracchus]
My lady, we must go at once!

861
01:13:22,830 --> 01:13:24,310
[Lucilla sobs]

862
01:13:25,570 --> 01:13:27,920
Lucius, you were loved

863
01:13:28,090 --> 01:13:31,140
by myself
and by your father.

864
01:13:31,310 --> 01:13:32,270
[sniffles]

865
01:13:32,450 --> 01:13:33,800
Your name
was on his lips--

866
01:13:33,970 --> 01:13:35,750
Get out!

867
01:13:40,670 --> 01:13:41,890
[panting]

868
01:13:42,060 --> 01:13:43,940
[door shuts]

869
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:54,640
[Lucilla exhales]

870
01:14:01,820 --> 01:14:03,700
Lucius is alive.

871
01:14:06,090 --> 01:14:07,790
Are you certain?

872
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:09,270
Yes.

873
01:14:10,220 --> 01:14:11,530
I know my son.

874
01:14:14,620 --> 01:14:16,450
I spoke to him
tonight.

875
01:14:19,890 --> 01:14:22,930
He may be lost to me
for what I did,

876
01:14:24,190 --> 01:14:25,850
but he lives.

877
01:14:27,110 --> 01:14:29,630
The third day of the games
is tomorrow.

878
01:14:29,810 --> 01:14:31,290
Most fighters won't survive.

879
01:14:31,460 --> 01:14:32,810
Acacius,

880
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:35,680
you must help him.

881
01:14:36,550 --> 01:14:38,430
Help him?[crying] Yes.

882
01:14:40,950 --> 01:14:43,430
I failed him then.

883
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,480
I know I did.

884
01:14:47,300 --> 01:14:49,440
I cannot fail him now.

885
01:14:52,090 --> 01:14:53,440
The army is in Ostia.

886
01:14:53,610 --> 01:14:56,310
If we wait a few days...

887
01:14:56,490 --> 01:14:58,490
He could be dead
by then.

888
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:01,840
Acacius,

889
01:15:02,010 --> 01:15:05,580
I would willingly
give my life for Rome,

890
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:09,200
but I will not
give my son's.

891
01:15:15,420 --> 01:15:17,640
[Viggo] And one.

892
01:15:18,510 --> 01:15:20,250
And two.

893
01:15:20,420 --> 01:15:23,040
And one.[all groaning with effort]

894
01:15:23,210 --> 01:15:26,040
Together.
Timing, timing, timing!

895
01:15:27,340 --> 01:15:30,390
And one. And two.

896
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:32,960
And one.

897
01:15:33,130 --> 01:15:35,000
Pause, pause!

898
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:39,050
We won't get far
like this.

899
01:15:39,230 --> 01:15:40,660
[all laughing]

900
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:43,140
Just him. You go.

901
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:45,010
Go!

902
01:15:45,190 --> 01:15:48,580
Let's see how far you can go
on your own without your team.

903
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:51,760
Ready?

904
01:15:51,930 --> 01:15:53,150
One!

905
01:15:54,070 --> 01:15:54,940
And two!

906
01:15:55,110 --> 01:15:57,160
Timing, timing!

907
01:15:57,900 --> 01:15:59,250
Come on, more!

908
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:01,550
[grunts]

909
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,080
[Viggo] More!

910
01:16:13,910 --> 01:16:15,870
[Lucius groans loudly]

911
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,750
[heavy grunt]

912
01:16:23,010 --> 01:16:24,140
Leave him.

913
01:16:24,310 --> 01:16:26,320
[indistinct chatter]

914
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:29,230
[huffs, grunts]

915
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:40,720
[cork pops]

916
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:46,510
[stammering]
It's just vinegar,
my friend.

917
01:16:47,250 --> 01:16:48,380
[pained groan]

918
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:50,990
There will be
no more opium for you.

919
01:16:52,390 --> 01:16:56,000
There is plenty of pain waiting
for you in the next life.

920
01:16:56,170 --> 01:16:59,480
I don't know why
you are so greedy for it
in this one.

921
01:17:04,220 --> 01:17:05,570
Are you a free man, Ravi?

922
01:17:05,750 --> 01:17:07,570
[dry chuckle] "Free."

923
01:17:09,270 --> 01:17:11,620
I am. Mm.

924
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:13,280
I laid down my sword

925
01:17:13,450 --> 01:17:15,360
and I swore never
to pick it up again.

926
01:17:15,540 --> 01:17:16,980
And yet
you choose this hell?

927
01:17:17,150 --> 01:17:18,720
Mm-hm.

928
01:17:18,890 --> 01:17:20,200
What was your home before?

929
01:17:21,460 --> 01:17:22,810
Varanasi.

930
01:17:22,980 --> 01:17:25,160
And why don't you go back?

931
01:17:25,330 --> 01:17:26,720
I wish I could.

932
01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:28,600
[breath hissing]
But...

933
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:33,170
I met a woman.
[laughs]
Ah.

934
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:36,430
- It's always a woman.
- Always.

935
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:40,430
She is from Londinium.
Britannia. You know.

936
01:17:40,610 --> 01:17:42,390
So now...

937
01:17:42,570 --> 01:17:45,440
our sons,
they speak only Latin.

938
01:17:45,610 --> 01:17:47,920
My daughter's eyes,
they are as blue as yours.

939
01:17:48,090 --> 01:17:49,490
[chuckles lightly]

940
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:52,230
We are Romans now.

941
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:56,010
I grew up hearing stories
at my grandfather's knee.

942
01:17:57,230 --> 01:18:00,540
He used to talk
of the dream that was Rome.

943
01:18:02,890 --> 01:18:06,760
It was so fragile,
you could only whisper it...

944
01:18:09,110 --> 01:18:10,860
or it would vanish.

945
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:13,210
[whispering] So,

946
01:18:13,380 --> 01:18:14,990
what was this dream?

947
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:19,650
A Rome where all could live
under fair law and be protected.

948
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:22,480
A Rome of the Senate.

949
01:18:24,130 --> 01:18:25,650
A Rome of hope.

950
01:18:28,790 --> 01:18:33,010
Your grandfather,
he sounds like
a dangerous man.

951
01:18:33,180 --> 01:18:34,400
Hm.

952
01:18:37,140 --> 01:18:39,270
The odds are against you.

[light chuckle]

954
01:18:41,670 --> 01:18:43,670
The odds
are always against me.

955
01:18:44,630 --> 01:18:45,760
Don't worry, old man.

956
01:18:45,930 --> 01:18:47,670
Eh?[both laughing]

[muttering]

958
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:53,380
You should
- get some rest. Hm?
- Mm.

959
01:18:54,510 --> 01:18:56,900
Your men will need you
to lead them tomorrow.

This is about survival.

Survive!

They have archers.

Be ready.
Listen for my commands.

Stay together
and pull as one, yes?

[crowd exclaiming]

1017
01:23:15,900 --> 01:23:17,900
Praetorians!

[crowd chanting]
Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

1019
01:23:21,820 --> 01:23:22,690
Move, move.

1020
01:23:22,860 --> 01:23:25,300
[chanting continues]

1021
01:23:29,700 --> 01:23:32,790
[announcer]
In the name of the emperors...

1022
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:37,530
the victor is Hanno!

1023
01:23:40,230 --> 01:23:42,450
[all chanting in support]

1024
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:51,110
Who did this?

1025
01:23:53,890 --> 01:23:56,110
Who did this?!

1026
01:23:56,810 --> 01:23:58,940
- It was me!
- I did it!

1027
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:00,940
- I did it! I did it! I did it!
- It was me!

1028
01:24:05,510 --> 01:24:07,600
Geta will want retribution
for all of you.

1029
01:24:08,690 --> 01:24:09,870
Did you learn to shoot
in the same place

1030
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:11,430
you learned to recite poetry?

1031
01:24:11,610 --> 01:24:12,690
Be glad it wasn't me,

1032
01:24:12,870 --> 01:24:14,130
or that arrow
would have found you.

1033

[faint music playing]

1036
01:24:30,020 --> 01:24:31,450
Be seated.

1037
01:24:33,980 --> 01:24:35,370
I have news for you.

1038
01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:41,330
He's here, sir.

1039
01:24:42,290 --> 01:24:44,340
[door opens]

1040
01:24:44,510 --> 01:24:46,470
[Macrinus]
Oh, still here.

1041
01:24:47,210 --> 01:24:48,470
[Thraex laughs nervously]

1042
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:49,990
Macrinus.

1043
01:24:50,170 --> 01:24:52,260
[Macrinus chuckles]
Welcome.

1044
01:24:53,870 --> 01:24:56,090
Yes, I'm listening.

1045
01:24:56,260 --> 01:24:58,780
You know
this is my house now.

1046
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:01,180
Your debt to me is
over 10,000 denarii.

1047
01:25:01,350 --> 01:25:02,660
You know that.

1048
01:25:02,830 --> 01:25:05,360
[chuckles, stammers]
I have other things. Uh...

1049
01:25:05,530 --> 01:25:07,230
Cattle. Art!

1050
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:08,920
Truth, then.

1051
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:10,620
What do you... want?

1052
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:13,410
Truth.
That's what I want.

1053
01:25:13,580 --> 01:25:17,980
Nothing happens in Rome
without your knowledge.

1054
01:25:19,150 --> 01:25:21,150
You have
the senators' trust.

1055
01:25:22,020 --> 01:25:24,160
You have
Lucilla's trust.

1056
01:25:24,330 --> 01:25:26,990
More importantly,
you have my trust.

1057
01:25:29,030 --> 01:25:32,910
You wish my... loyalty?

1058
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:34,730
I own...

1059
01:25:36,170 --> 01:25:37,950
your house.

1060
01:25:38,130 --> 01:25:40,740
I want your loyalty.

1061
01:25:44,530 --> 01:25:45,920
I...

1062
01:25:47,140 --> 01:25:48,830
- Tell me.
- I have heard...

1063
01:25:49,010 --> 01:25:51,660
of a plot...

1064
01:25:52,580 --> 01:25:55,190
- to dethrone the emperors.
- Yes.

1065
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:57,760
But the plan
has been delayed, uh...

1066
01:25:57,930 --> 01:26:00,980
A gladiator is to be rescued
from the arena.

1067
01:26:01,150 --> 01:26:02,500
- Tonight.
- Mm.

1068
01:26:02,670 --> 01:26:05,760
- I don't know why.
- I know why. I know who.

1069
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:09,200
Pack.

1070
01:26:12,860 --> 01:26:14,380
Quickly.

1071
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:43,410
[pounding on gate][man] Open up!

1072
01:26:43,580 --> 01:26:45,630
[rats squeaking]

1073
01:26:58,690 --> 01:27:00,250
[mastiffs growling]

1074
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:05,520
[man] Open for
the emperors' guard!

1075
01:27:05,690 --> 01:27:07,220
[pounding on door]

1076
01:27:29,940 --> 01:27:31,420
[heavy knocking]

1077
01:27:33,070 --> 01:27:36,510
My Lady, come with us.

1078
01:27:47,340 --> 01:27:49,000
[all grunting with impact]

1079
01:28:21,900 --> 01:28:24,080
Thanks to the civic virtue

1080
01:28:24,250 --> 01:28:26,820
of men like Thraex
and Macrinus,

1081
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:29,820
your insurrection

1082
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:32,480
has been revealed.

1083
01:28:34,390 --> 01:28:35,700
The honor,

1084
01:28:36,830 --> 01:28:40,660
the dignitas that Rome
has bestowed upon you...

1085
01:28:43,180 --> 01:28:46,140
all this you have forfeited
by your treachery.

1086
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:48,270
Please, Emperor Geta.

1087
01:28:48,970 --> 01:28:50,800
Torture me if you want,

1088
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:53,060
but do not lecture me.

1089
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:56,630
Your name
will be forgotten!

1090
01:28:57,760 --> 01:29:00,770
Lost... to history.

1091
01:29:02,770 --> 01:29:04,070
You are damned,
General.

1092
01:29:04,250 --> 01:29:05,990
[laughing]

1093
01:29:06,900 --> 01:29:08,820
[Geta]
- You laugh.
- You damn me?

1094
01:29:09,990 --> 01:29:11,650
I don't care.

1095
01:29:11,820 --> 01:29:15,210
Everything is forgotten in time.
Empires fall. So do emperors.

1096
01:29:15,390 --> 01:29:17,040
[Caracalla] Why wait?

1097
01:29:17,220 --> 01:29:20,310
- I will gut him right now!
- No, no, no!

1098
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:23,700
Let them be. Come! Come!

1099
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:25,620
His death must be public.

1100
01:29:25,790 --> 01:29:27,230
Public? [grunts]

1101
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:30,140
Hang his entrails
from the city gates!

1102
01:29:30,320 --> 01:29:31,880
And crucify her!

1103
01:29:32,620 --> 01:29:34,020
Crucify her!

1104
01:29:34,190 --> 01:29:36,060
Take them away!

1105
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:39,540
[Caracalla yells][Geta] Shh! Shh! Shh!

1106
01:29:52,730 --> 01:29:53,860
Thank you, Macrinus.

1107
01:30:00,220 --> 01:30:01,520
Come on.

1108
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:06,790
In these last days,

1109
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:10,100
I have come to think of you
not as a subject

1110
01:30:10,270 --> 01:30:12,400
but as a true friend.

1111
01:30:12,580 --> 01:30:14,190
Thank you.

1112
01:30:14,360 --> 01:30:16,930
Thank you so much.
But as a friend,

1113
01:30:17,100 --> 01:30:19,760
I must counsel caution.

1114
01:30:19,930 --> 01:30:22,890
Acacius is a hero of Rome.

1115
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:27,160
Crucifixion
is for thieves.

1116
01:30:27,330 --> 01:30:28,460
Christians.

1117
01:30:29,640 --> 01:30:32,510
- It's too common.
- He is a traitor.
He must die.

1118
01:30:32,680 --> 01:30:33,990
I agree.

1119
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:39,860
Let the gods decide
his fate in the Colosseum.

1120
01:30:46,260 --> 01:30:47,870
Let the gods decide.

1121
01:30:50,740 --> 01:30:54,710
You know, last night I woke,
dreaming of a dark river.

1122
01:30:56,320 --> 01:30:58,140
This time,
for the first time,

1123
01:30:58,320 --> 01:30:59,800
I was crossing it.

1124
01:31:00,620 --> 01:31:02,230
[Ravi] Hm.

1125
01:31:02,410 --> 01:31:04,800
Well, you know,
where I come from,

1126
01:31:04,980 --> 01:31:07,890
crossing a river,
it represents forgiveness.

1127
01:31:08,070 --> 01:31:10,980
Represents... salvation.

1128
01:31:11,160 --> 01:31:14,120
Where I come from,
it means
you're already dead.

1129
01:31:14,290 --> 01:31:16,990
[chuckles]

1130
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:25,000
But as I saw it,
I was not afraid.

1131
01:31:26,740 --> 01:31:28,350
For...

1132
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:31,350
For someone was waiting
for me on the other side.

1133
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:34,700
There. [sniffs]

1134
01:31:45,020 --> 01:31:46,500
Who is this man?

1135
01:31:47,890 --> 01:31:49,320
Scratched out?

1136
01:31:50,240 --> 01:31:52,280
Maximus.

1137
01:31:55,070 --> 01:31:57,030
I saw him fight once.

1138
01:31:58,120 --> 01:31:59,640
- He was magnificent.
- Mm.

1139
01:31:59,810 --> 01:32:02,690
Yeah. My time in the arena,
it was after his,

1140
01:32:02,860 --> 01:32:06,990
but many still talked of him
in whispers, you know?

1141
01:32:07,170 --> 01:32:09,390
Spoke of him.

1142
01:32:10,170 --> 01:32:11,830
What he did.

1143
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:13,870
I met him once.

1144
01:32:15,700 --> 01:32:17,220
He was kind.

1145
01:32:19,530 --> 01:32:21,400
He bowed to no one.

1146
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:26,450
Come with me.

1147
01:32:26,620 --> 01:32:29,630
- Hmm?
- Come. With me.

1148
01:32:48,780 --> 01:32:52,870
When a rebel gladiator dies,
we bury them here.

1149
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:57,440
"What we do in life
echoes in eternity."

1150
01:33:15,150 --> 01:33:16,930
This is Argento.

1151
01:33:17,110 --> 01:33:18,590
This is Scatto.

1152
01:33:25,770 --> 01:33:28,690

Cheers.

1157
01:34:01,330 --> 01:34:02,720
And stop.

1158
01:34:04,420 --> 01:34:08,420
For his treason
against the lives

1159
01:34:08,590 --> 01:34:12,550
of the emperors
and the Roman state,

From the vanquished city
of Numidia,

1178
01:35:44,650 --> 01:35:49,780
the victor of two conquests
in the Colosseum...

1179
01:35:49,960 --> 01:35:52,480
Go now. Vae victis.

Oh, Lord, any honor I have,

1183
01:36:05,100 --> 01:36:06,710
- I will give it to you!
- It's too late.

1184
01:36:06,890 --> 01:36:10,060
[announcer]
The Roman traitor or

1185
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:12,500
the barbarian hero.

1186
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:14,980
Let the gods decide.

1187
01:36:15,160 --> 01:36:16,810
Lucius... wait.

1188
01:36:18,330 --> 01:36:19,460
Wait! Wait!

I am a vessel.

1192
01:36:33,610 --> 01:36:35,830
Fill me with vengeance

1193
01:36:36,830 --> 01:36:39,050
and vanquish the betrayer.

Acacius
has raised his hand!

1212
01:38:03,610 --> 01:38:05,830
He has surrendered.

[monkey screeching]

1216
01:38:33,080 --> 01:38:35,910
The gods have rendered
their judgment.

1217
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:40,520
Do what you must.

1218
01:38:41,650 --> 01:38:44,000
But on my death,
you have to know...

1219
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:47,830
I love your mother,
Lucilla.

1220
01:38:49,310 --> 01:38:50,660
And your father...

1221
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:54,450
Maximus.

1222
01:38:55,790 --> 01:38:57,840
I would have died
for him.

1223
01:38:58,010 --> 01:38:59,800
Kill him!

1224

Please!

Kill him!

Damn you!

[breath heaving]

1244
01:39:54,110 --> 01:39:55,990
Death will be
too good for you!

1245
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:04,690
Is this how Rome
treats its heroes?

1246
01:40:08,690 --> 01:40:10,170
Tell me!

1247
01:40:12,350 --> 01:40:16,790
If his life has no value,
what are yours worth?

1248
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:21,920
The gods have spoken!

[crowd booing]

1253
01:40:55,090 --> 01:40:58,050
For our own safety,
we should return to the palace.

[Lucius, faintly] Arishat!

[door opens]

1263
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:33,450
We had a bargain.

1264
01:42:37,150 --> 01:42:40,320
I gave him to you.
You let him live.

1265
01:42:40,500 --> 01:42:42,110
And you got
what you wanted.

1266
01:42:42,280 --> 01:42:44,810
I always get what I want.
Why did you let him live?

1267
01:42:44,980 --> 01:42:47,810
You bought a gladiator,
not a slave.

1268
01:42:49,550 --> 01:42:51,290
My will is my own.

1269
01:42:53,550 --> 01:42:54,860
Ah...

1270
01:42:55,030 --> 01:42:57,640
How blue is your blood?

1271
01:42:57,820 --> 01:43:00,300
Perhaps the heart of a Roman

1272
01:43:00,470 --> 01:43:02,690
beats in that chest.
[chuckles]

1273
01:43:08,390 --> 01:43:11,180
The greatest temple
Rome ever built.

1274
01:43:11,350 --> 01:43:12,830
The Colosseum.

1275
01:43:13,010 --> 01:43:15,230
Because this is
what they believe in.

1276
01:43:15,400 --> 01:43:16,970
Power.

1277
01:43:17,140 --> 01:43:19,750
They gather here to watch
the strong strike down the weak.

1278
01:43:19,930 --> 01:43:21,710
There has to be
- something else.
- There is nothing else.

1279
01:43:21,890 --> 01:43:24,630
There has to be
- another Rome.
- There is no other Rome.

1280
01:43:26,150 --> 01:43:27,670
- The "dream"?
- Mm.

1281
01:43:27,850 --> 01:43:29,680
The dream of Rome?

1282
01:43:29,850 --> 01:43:31,330
It's an old man's fantasy.

1283
01:43:33,160 --> 01:43:34,510
Who are you?

1284
01:43:37,640 --> 01:43:40,600
What was your name
before you traded it
for a Roman one?

1285
01:43:41,690 --> 01:43:43,120
You'll never know.

1286
01:43:45,950 --> 01:43:47,520
I have a destiny.

1287
01:43:51,050 --> 01:43:53,350
The gods delivered you to me.

1288
01:43:56,400 --> 01:43:58,050
You will be my instrument.

1289
01:43:58,230 --> 01:44:01,490
I will never be
your instrument,
in this life or the next.

1290
01:44:09,800 --> 01:44:12,980
[door opening]
That will not be my destiny.

1291
01:44:15,030 --> 01:44:16,590
But I will see your end.

1292

[monkey chittering]

1294
01:44:37,700 --> 01:44:39,490
What else could I do?

1295
01:44:39,660 --> 01:44:41,400
He and his bitch
were plotting to kill us.

1296
01:44:41,570 --> 01:44:44,140
Don't you hear them?
They're calling for our heads!

1297
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:46,280
The Praetorians
will put down this crowd.

1298
01:44:46,450 --> 01:44:48,100
- Like they have every other.
- You brought this on us.

1299

Filthy ape![monkey squeaking in fear]

1300
01:44:54,370 --> 01:44:57,020
[Macrinus]
Perhaps you should, uh,

1301
01:44:57,200 --> 01:45:01,510
take Dondus elsewhere
to comfort him?

1302
01:45:11,130 --> 01:45:13,350
Forgive
my brother's outburst.

1303
01:45:15,300 --> 01:45:16,740
The disease
that infects his loins

1304
01:45:16,910 --> 01:45:18,790
has spread to his brain.

1305
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:21,960
- Every day he gets worse.
- I will reason with him.

[all yelling, shouting]

[Dondus hooting]

1308
01:45:38,330 --> 01:45:41,370
[singsong] I see you.

1309
01:45:41,550 --> 01:45:43,550
I see you.

1310
01:45:44,990 --> 01:45:47,070
Caracalla, Caracalla!

1311
01:45:47,250 --> 01:45:48,820
Come on, stand up.

1312
01:45:48,990 --> 01:45:50,990
Get up, get up.
Not you.

1313
01:45:51,170 --> 01:45:52,910
All right,
there you go.

1314
01:45:54,650 --> 01:45:56,910
Now, listen to me.

1315
01:45:57,080 --> 01:45:58,560
What's the matter?

1316
01:45:58,740 --> 01:46:01,310
[panting]
Nothing's ever mine.

1317
01:46:01,480 --> 01:46:03,740
Everything is ours, always.

1318
01:46:03,920 --> 01:46:07,090
Even in the womb...
[stammering] he tried...

1319
01:46:07,970 --> 01:46:11,230
to cut my umbilicus

1320
01:46:11,400 --> 01:46:13,140
so that I couldn't have
any more air.

1321
01:46:13,320 --> 01:46:15,490
You remember that,
- do you?
- Certainly.

1322
01:46:15,670 --> 01:46:17,930
- Come, sit.
- One cannot forget.

1323
01:46:18,110 --> 01:46:20,240
My conscience compels me.

1324
01:46:20,410 --> 01:46:21,760
What?

1325
01:46:21,940 --> 01:46:23,070
Sit.

1326
01:46:23,240 --> 01:46:24,590
Your brother

1327
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:26,980
means to blame you

1328
01:46:28,030 --> 01:46:30,340
in front of
the entire Senate...

1329
01:46:30,510 --> 01:46:31,820
But I did not do it!

1330
01:46:31,990 --> 01:46:33,470
...for what's happening
in the streets.

1331
01:46:33,640 --> 01:46:35,950
- The chaos!
- He's lying!

1332
01:46:36,120 --> 01:46:37,860
No testimony
can be more damning

1333
01:46:38,040 --> 01:46:41,390
than one brother
against another.

1334
01:46:41,560 --> 01:46:44,130
That's a lie!
He always lies!

1335
01:46:44,310 --> 01:46:46,700
He can be very persuasive.

1336
01:46:46,870 --> 01:46:49,530
So?
What will they do to me?

1337
01:46:49,700 --> 01:46:52,360
Oh, I don't dare imagine.
But imagine this:

1338
01:46:52,530 --> 01:46:54,530
What will they do to Dondus?

1339

What will they do

01:47:00,630 --> 01:47:01,930
to Dondus?

Put down the blade.

1347
01:47:49,890 --> 01:47:50,940
You lie.

1348
01:47:51,110 --> 01:47:52,810
- Give it to me.
- You always lie!

1349

Give it-- [grunts]

[Geta exclaiming]

Look at me.
Look at me. Look at me.

- Lie!
- Listen to me.
Break the spell.

- Lie!
- Break the spell!

1355

I've always protected you.
Because I love you.

1356

Come back. Help me.

[hinges creaking]

1362
01:48:56,440 --> 01:48:58,960
Never could have imagined
the fates would lead us here.

[Lucius chuckles dryly]

1364

And yet here we are.

1365

Everything has
brought us full circle.

1366
01:49:06,490 --> 01:49:09,490
You sent me away
and yet fate

1367
01:49:09,670 --> 01:49:12,110
brought me back
to the very ground
where he died.

[Lucilla] This ring...

1369
01:49:18,020 --> 01:49:19,680
belonged to my father.

1370
01:49:23,810 --> 01:49:26,770
He gave it
to your father,
Maximus,

1371
01:49:26,950 --> 01:49:28,770
as a token of trust.

1372
01:49:30,210 --> 01:49:33,170
I gave it to Acacius
for his valor.

1373
01:49:37,700 --> 01:49:39,870
This ring belonged to my wife.

1374
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:44,360
I shall wear it next to yours.

1375
01:49:58,630 --> 01:50:01,070
I am truly sorry for Acacius.

1376

I could not see the man.

[sniffles]

1378
01:50:07,420 --> 01:50:09,250
He was a soldier of Rome.

1379
01:50:11,250 --> 01:50:12,600
There was a plan.

1380
01:50:13,910 --> 01:50:15,210
He was readying troops
at Ostia

1381
01:50:15,390 --> 01:50:18,350
under the command
of Darius Sextus.

1382
01:50:18,520 --> 01:50:21,520
Troops he was to lead
against the emperors.

1383

Acacius. Maximus.
Marcus Aurelius.

1384
01:50:29,100 --> 01:50:31,450
They lived and died
for Rome.

1385
01:50:32,190 --> 01:50:33,620
We all do.

1386
01:50:35,710 --> 01:50:38,020
Is it true
they intend to kill you?

[chuckles lightly]

One man or another
has had a sword
against my neck

1389
01:50:43,150 --> 01:50:45,460
since the day
my father died.

1390

But now
that I've found you,

it doesn't matter.

1392
01:50:54,690 --> 01:50:56,380
I am not afraid.

1393

I've become well versed
in losing the things
that I love.

1394

But now that I've found you,

1395

I have no desire
to lose you again.

I do not have his strength.

I wish that were true.

I wish I were telling you
to flee this place.

my First Consul

1413

to administer the military

of the Empire.

There will be

with good fortune
and not a little skill...

[all gasping, murmuring]

01:54:05,310 --> 01:54:07,570
I can speak logic to it...

01:54:12,360 --> 01:54:14,840
and tame the madness
in the street. But...

to restore order...

1446
01:54:21,500 --> 01:54:23,330
I must have power...

01:54:29,810 --> 01:54:31,770
over the Praetorian Army.

You can sit down.

[Macrinus] Rome must fall.

1456
01:55:20,300 --> 01:55:22,300
I need only
give it a push.

01:55:25,390 --> 01:55:27,570
[Lucilla]
And after Rome falls...

1458
01:55:28,530 --> 01:55:30,920
[dry chuckle]
...what then?

1459
01:55:33,050 --> 01:55:35,050
You are
your father's child.

1460
01:55:37,100 --> 01:55:40,490
His dream of Rome
was never a dream.

1461
01:55:40,670 --> 01:55:42,580
It was a fiction.

1462

"The best revenge is

to become unlike the one
who did the injury."

1464
01:55:49,150 --> 01:55:54,030
I have made myself
unlike your father.

1465
01:55:54,200 --> 01:55:57,680
He spoke of dreams,
I speak of truth.

1466
01:55:57,860 --> 01:56:00,250
And the only truth
in my Rome

1467
01:56:01,860 --> 01:56:03,860
is the law
of the strongest.

1468
01:56:06,170 --> 01:56:07,520
I was owned

1469
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:10,520
by an emperor.

1470
01:56:13,530 --> 01:56:15,620
Now I control an empire.

1471
01:56:16,700 --> 01:56:19,970
Where else but in Rome
can a man do that?

1472
01:56:25,280 --> 01:56:29,760
Do you recognize
your father's mark on me?

1473
01:56:34,590 --> 01:56:35,900
If there is anything

1474
01:56:36,590 --> 01:56:37,990
you need...

1475
01:56:39,730 --> 01:56:41,380
in these last hours,

1476

we will provide.

01:56:49,780 --> 01:56:52,480
Your death will clear my path
to the throne.

Tomorrow
there will be games.

And at them...

1480
01:56:59,960 --> 01:57:01,660
I will prevail.

What is in Ostia?

There is an army.

I'm asking you
to risk yourself, my friend,

in the service
of something greater.

01:58:23,050 --> 01:58:25,090
Should I?Yes.

1504
01:58:32,010 --> 01:58:34,710
Ravi! I need your keys.

1505
01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:42,500
Thank you.

1506
01:59:20,370 --> 01:59:22,800
Stop! Come back!

1507
01:59:35,290 --> 01:59:37,340
[panting]

1508
01:59:44,520 --> 01:59:45,700
[inhales sharply]

1509
01:59:53,570 --> 01:59:54,700
Who gave you this?

1510
01:59:55,710 --> 01:59:57,840
Lucius Verus Aurelius.

1511
01:59:59,060 --> 02:00:00,280
The Prince of Rome.

1512
02:00:21,770 --> 02:00:23,780
[horses snort, whinnying]

1513
02:00:28,870 --> 02:00:31,220
[crowd cheering
in distance]

1514
02:00:53,460 --> 02:00:56,510
[whispering]
Must we kill Lucilla?

1515
02:00:58,160 --> 02:01:01,900
[quietly] Until she dies,
you will never know peace.

1516
02:01:03,770 --> 02:01:04,820
Ever.

1517
02:01:07,910 --> 02:01:10,000
[horns playing fanfare]

1518
02:01:15,740 --> 02:01:18,270
The people love her.
Her death will incite the mob.

1519
02:01:18,440 --> 02:01:20,920
If she dies and the streets
rise up in anger,

1520
02:01:21,090 --> 02:01:22,490
I shall deliver them
Caracalla's head

1521
02:01:22,660 --> 02:01:24,010
and the people
shall acclaim me.

1522
02:01:24,180 --> 02:01:27,750
That, my friend,
is politics.

1523
02:01:30,580 --> 02:01:32,410
- Shall we?
- Yes.

1524
02:01:47,690 --> 02:01:49,780
Today will be
your last fight, champion.

1525
02:01:50,910 --> 02:01:52,520
And our master
has bestowed on you...

1526
02:01:54,910 --> 02:01:57,310
the wooden sword of freedom.

1527
02:02:01,310 --> 02:02:03,270
But you have to
earn it first.

1528
02:02:03,440 --> 02:02:05,750
Today, you're gonna
defend your mother.

1529
02:02:12,450 --> 02:02:14,580
[soldier shouting][grunting]

1530
02:02:14,760 --> 02:02:16,980
[all yelling]

1531
02:02:25,460 --> 02:02:28,510
[grunting explosively]

1532
02:02:28,680 --> 02:02:31,510
Wood or steel,
a point is still a point!

1533
02:02:34,040 --> 02:02:35,730
[arrows whistling]

1534
02:02:58,800 --> 02:03:00,320
[Lucius] Wait for me.

1535
02:03:19,130 --> 02:03:20,820
In honor

1536
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:25,260
of the acclamation
of Emperor Caracalla,

1537
02:03:25,440 --> 02:03:31,310
First Consul Dondus
and Second Consul Macrinus,

1538
02:03:31,490 --> 02:03:35,970
and as punishment
for her conspiracy
against the empire,

1539
02:03:36,140 --> 02:03:40,500
for her calumnies against
the emperor's imperial bloodline

1540
02:03:40,670 --> 02:03:42,850
and for fomenting
military mutiny

1541
02:03:43,020 --> 02:03:44,410
along with her husband,

1542
02:03:44,590 --> 02:03:48,200
the queen will face
divine justice

1543
02:03:48,370 --> 02:03:52,420
at the hands
of the Praetorian Guard.

1544
02:03:56,690 --> 02:03:59,120
[crowd cheering faintly]

1545
02:04:16,920 --> 02:04:18,450
I am not a general.

1546
02:04:20,140 --> 02:04:23,630
But we are all soldiers.

1547
02:04:25,630 --> 02:04:27,370
And up until now,

1548
02:04:27,540 --> 02:04:31,720
we have fought for nothing more
than another day's survival.

1549
02:04:31,890 --> 02:04:33,720
What will you
have us do?

1550
02:04:35,070 --> 02:04:36,250
Well, you can return
to your cells

1551
02:04:36,420 --> 02:04:38,340
if you do not wish
to fight this battle.

1552
02:04:38,510 --> 02:04:40,820
[all laughing]
Or...

1553
02:04:42,560 --> 02:04:43,910
you can join me.

1554
02:04:45,210 --> 02:04:47,520
And fight for a freedom
far beyond these walls.

1555
02:04:47,690 --> 02:04:49,220
[all] Aye!

1556
02:04:49,390 --> 02:04:53,520
There once was a time when
honor meant something in Rome.

1557
02:04:55,220 --> 02:04:56,750
In this Rome

1558
02:04:57,660 --> 02:04:59,750
I no longer believe
that exists.

1559
02:04:59,920 --> 02:05:01,840
We must find it!

1560
02:05:02,010 --> 02:05:04,010
[all murmuring in agreement]

1561
02:05:04,190 --> 02:05:05,840
[Lucius] And know this:

1562
02:05:07,190 --> 02:05:10,930
Where death is, we are not.

1563
02:05:12,940 --> 02:05:14,850
Where we are,

1564
02:05:15,590 --> 02:05:17,330
death is not!

1565
02:05:20,330 --> 02:05:21,600
By my sword.

1566
02:05:23,510 --> 02:05:25,210
Strength and honor.

1567
02:05:25,380 --> 02:05:27,210
[all] Strength and honor!

1568
02:05:27,380 --> 02:05:28,990
Strength and honor!

1569
02:05:29,170 --> 02:05:31,000
Strength and honor!

1570
02:05:40,570 --> 02:05:43,100
[indistinct shouting]

1571
02:05:43,270 --> 02:05:45,140
[growling]

1572
02:05:50,410 --> 02:05:52,540
[snarling]

1573
02:05:55,720 --> 02:05:57,760
Let it not be said

1574
02:05:57,940 --> 02:06:00,980
that the emperor
is not merciful.

1575
02:06:01,160 --> 02:06:06,600
The queen will be granted
a single gladiator

1576
02:06:06,770 --> 02:06:10,430
to defend her against
the Praetorian Guard.

1577
02:06:10,600 --> 02:06:12,780
[crowd jeering]

1578
02:06:20,480 --> 02:06:24,400
The champion, Hanno!

1579
02:06:24,570 --> 02:06:26,570
[crowd roars]

1580
02:06:28,360 --> 02:06:31,840
[people chanting]
Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

1581
02:06:51,210 --> 02:06:53,380
[all booing]

1582
02:07:24,940 --> 02:07:26,810
[all shouting]

1583
02:07:35,510 --> 02:07:37,300
[grunting]

1584
02:07:37,470 --> 02:07:39,210
Yes!

1585
02:07:43,430 --> 02:07:45,260
Summon the cavalry.
Put this down at once.

1586
02:07:46,780 --> 02:07:49,180
This is war! Real war!

1587
02:07:54,180 --> 02:07:57,530
The army of Acacius
is advancing
just outside of Rome, sir.

1588
02:08:00,190 --> 02:08:01,580
We can still
outflank them.

1589
02:08:01,760 --> 02:08:04,060
They have only
5,000 troops, no more.

1590
02:08:05,410 --> 02:08:06,850
How many are we?

1591
02:08:07,020 --> 02:08:08,330
Six thousand.
Perhaps more.

1592
02:08:08,500 --> 02:08:10,070
Ride to the gate
and hold them.

1593
02:08:10,240 --> 02:08:12,160
[aggressive grunting]

1594
02:08:20,210 --> 02:08:21,650
[cheering]

1595
02:08:35,570 --> 02:08:36,880
[screams]

1596
02:08:37,050 --> 02:08:39,140
[yelps, whimpering]

1597
02:08:45,150 --> 02:08:46,100

02:08:46,280 --> 02:08:48,760
[all shouting angrily]

02:08:52,680 --> 02:08:53,980
[screams]

1600
02:08:56,330 --> 02:08:58,070
[arrow whistles][grunts]

1601
02:09:01,900 --> 02:09:02,950
Filthy scum!

1602
02:09:16,830 --> 02:09:18,350
[Lucilla] Lucius!

1603
02:09:20,140 --> 02:09:21,180
Give me the bow.

1604
02:09:24,580 --> 02:09:26,190
[bow creaking]

1605
02:09:30,800 --> 02:09:32,890
[both gasp]

1606
02:09:44,990 --> 02:09:47,430
Go, my son. Lucius--

1607
02:09:47,600 --> 02:09:48,650
Shh-sh-sh-sh...

1608
02:09:48,820 --> 02:09:50,210
Horse!

1609
02:09:50,390 --> 02:09:52,520
[people shouting, clamoring]

1610
02:09:57,570 --> 02:09:59,610

02:10:15,240 --> 02:10:17,070
[feet marching]

1613
02:10:17,240 --> 02:10:19,720
[man shouting cadence]

1614
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,050
Will nothing
kill this barbarian?

1615
02:11:25,220 --> 02:11:27,700
My name is
Lucius Verus Aurelius!

1616
02:11:27,880 --> 02:11:30,140
[Macrinus]
A man does not become
emperor by bloodline alone.

1617
02:11:30,310 --> 02:11:32,970
It must be taken by force
and kept by force.

1618
02:11:33,140 --> 02:11:34,930
Are you such a man
as this?

1619
02:11:35,100 --> 02:11:36,450
[Lucius]
I don't fight for power.

1620
02:11:36,620 --> 02:11:39,280
I fight to free Rome
from men like you

1621
02:11:39,450 --> 02:11:40,890
and to return it to them.

1622
02:11:41,060 --> 02:11:43,800
The gods themselves
want Rome reborn.

1623
02:11:43,980 --> 02:11:46,850
They sent me...
to fulfill that task.

1624
02:11:47,020 --> 02:11:50,460
And what if your gods
sent me here to kill you?

1625
02:11:50,640 --> 02:11:51,680
Huh?

1626
02:11:52,860 --> 02:11:55,030
It's time to end this, Macrinus!

1627
02:11:55,210 --> 02:11:57,120
[aggressive yell]

1628
02:12:03,130 --> 02:12:05,170

Hah![screams]

02:12:34,420 --> 02:12:35,290

[blade clanging
against breastplate]

1635
02:13:00,050 --> 02:13:03,060
[metallic clangs echoing]

1636
02:13:03,230 --> 02:13:04,710
[Lucilla]
Strength and honor,

1637
02:13:05,320 --> 02:13:06,840
my son.

1638
02:13:09,190 --> 02:13:10,240
[grunts]

1639
02:13:23,770 --> 02:13:24,990

02:13:26,860 --> 02:13:28,000
[groans in pain]

02:13:55,410 --> 02:13:56,680
[panting]

1642
02:13:56,850 --> 02:13:58,680
[pained groan]

1643
02:14:40,200 --> 02:14:41,940
You look to me to speak.

1644
02:14:44,160 --> 02:14:45,770
I know not what
to say other than

1645
02:14:45,940 --> 02:14:47,940
we have all known
too much death.

1646
02:14:49,210 --> 02:14:52,690
Let no more blood be spilt
in the name of tyranny.

1647
02:14:56,650 --> 02:14:59,130
My grandfather,
Marcus Aurelius,

1648
02:14:59,300 --> 02:15:02,090
talked of a dream
that would be Rome.

1649
02:15:03,130 --> 02:15:05,050
A dream that my father,

1650
02:15:06,270 --> 02:15:09,010
Maximus Decimus Meridius,

1651
02:15:09,180 --> 02:15:10,710
died for.

1652
02:15:11,920 --> 02:15:13,540
An ideal.

1653
02:15:16,320 --> 02:15:20,590
A city for the many
and a refuge
for those in need.

1654
02:15:20,760 --> 02:15:23,240
A home worth fighting for.

1655
02:15:24,370 --> 02:15:28,640
A home that Maximus
spent his life defending.

1656
02:15:30,730 --> 02:15:32,550
That dream is lost.

1657
02:15:38,520 --> 02:15:40,130
But dare we...

1658
02:15:41,690 --> 02:15:44,310
rebuild that dream
together?

1659
02:15:56,230 --> 02:15:58,010
What say you?

1660
02:16:04,370 --> 02:16:06,200
Aye!

1661
02:16:07,370 --> 02:16:08,680
Aye!

1662
02:16:09,420 --> 02:16:10,590
Aye!

1663
02:16:10,770 --> 02:16:15,120
[all] Aye! Aye! Aye! Aye!

1664
02:16:17,430 --> 02:16:20,820
[all chanting]

1665
02:17:19,790 --> 02:17:21,010
Mother.

1666
02:18:13,580 --> 02:18:15,760
Speak to me, Father.
