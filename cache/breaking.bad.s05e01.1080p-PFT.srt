00:15:27,524 --> 00:15:29,224
Jesus.

169
00:15:30,527 --> 00:15:32,861
What is it with you guys?

170
00:15:32,896 --> 00:15:34,797
Honest to God.

171
00:15:36,866 --> 00:15:38,066
May I?

172
00:15:40,036 --> 00:15:44,238
Look. Whatever differences
you and I have, they'll keep.

173
00:15:44,272 --> 00:15:46,741
Right now we've got
bigger fish to fry.

174
00:15:47,843 --> 00:15:49,477
Bigger fish.

175
00:15:49,511 --> 00:15:51,078
The video cameras.

176
00:15:51,112 --> 00:15:53,981
Gus kept cameras on us
at the lab,

177
00:15:54,015 --> 00:15:56,451
at the laundry,
God only knows where else.

178
00:15:56,485 --> 00:15:57,885
And, of course,
when I say "us,"

179
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,219
including you.

180
00:15:59,254 --> 00:16:00,554
Mike.

181
00:16:01,856 --> 00:16:04,157
Mike, if he taped
all that shit--

182
00:16:04,191 --> 00:16:06,927
Us cooking, you picking up...

183
00:16:06,961 --> 00:16:10,564
If Gus had a record of that and the
police get to it before we do...

184
00:16:10,598 --> 00:16:13,467
- You son of a bitch.
- Mike, it's all on tape somewhere,

185
00:16:13,501 --> 00:16:16,134
or a hard drive.

186
00:16:16,169 --> 00:16:17,636
Where?

187
00:16:17,671 --> 00:16:19,071
Where did he keep it?

188
00:16:22,241 --> 00:16:27,546
He had a laptop in his office.
He kept it at the back of the restaurant.

189
00:16:28,915 --> 00:16:31,016
It all fed straight to there.

190
00:16:39,191 --> 00:16:40,692
What?

191
00:16:40,726 --> 00:16:42,627
Keys, scumbag.

192
00:16:42,661 --> 00:16:45,763
It's the universal symbol
for keys.

193
00:17:16,714 --> 00:17:17,880
<i>[Mike] Meter fraud.</i>

194
00:17:17,914 --> 00:17:20,350
Yes, yes, it's a big deal.

195
00:17:20,384 --> 00:17:23,353
Guy rigs his meter
so he's paying two cents less

196
00:17:23,387 --> 00:17:25,221
for first-class postage.

197
00:17:25,256 --> 00:17:26,955
I'm here to tell you

198
00:17:26,989 --> 00:17:29,891
that the USPS
takes that very seriously.

199
00:17:29,925 --> 00:17:33,962
It's money out of your pocket.
It's money out of my pocket.

200
00:17:33,996 --> 00:17:37,566
I was hoping--
Now, look, sarge.

201
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,668
Do you think we could work
together on this thing?

202
00:17:39,702 --> 00:17:41,303
You folks have it over there?

203
00:17:41,337 --> 00:17:43,170
Could you tell me that,
at least?

204
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:47,708
Yeah.

205
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:49,977
Yeah.

206
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,614
Well, thanks for your help.

207
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:56,116
Uh, Inspector Clark,
Inspector Dave Clark,

208
00:17:56,151 --> 00:17:57,918
like the Dave Clark Five?

209
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:01,154
Oh, before your time.

210
00:18:01,188 --> 00:18:04,557
Well, you feel free to call me
day or night at this number.

211
00:18:04,592 --> 00:18:09,562
Yes, sir.
No, you as well.

212
00:18:12,099 --> 00:18:13,466
Oh, yeah.

213
00:18:13,501 --> 00:18:16,468
We're boned.
[Cell phone snaps]

214
00:18:20,139 --> 00:18:21,239
Well...

215
00:18:23,343 --> 00:18:24,910
You know how they say

216
00:18:24,944 --> 00:18:26,712
"it's been a pleasure"?

217
00:18:27,947 --> 00:18:29,315
It hasn't.

218
00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:32,750
Are you going to tell us
about the laptop?

219
00:18:32,785 --> 00:18:36,688
- Where you going?
- I'm gettin' the hell out of dodge, kid,

220
00:18:36,722 --> 00:18:37,988
and so should you.

221
00:18:38,023 --> 00:18:39,757
It's just a matter of time.

222
00:18:39,792 --> 00:18:41,359
Mike,

223
00:18:41,393 --> 00:18:43,260
where is the laptop?

224
00:18:43,295 --> 00:18:44,595
What the hell difference
does it make?

225
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:46,363
They got it. End of story.

226
00:18:53,338 --> 00:18:57,140
APD, Northwest area command,
on 2nd.

227
00:18:57,174 --> 00:18:59,175
They tagged it, they filed it,

228
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:00,744
it's in the system,

229
00:19:00,778 --> 00:19:03,078
and they locked it
in their evidence room.

230
00:19:03,112 --> 00:19:06,114
All right.

231
00:19:06,149 --> 00:19:10,319
All right. So...
Describe the building.

232
00:19:10,354 --> 00:19:12,722
[Chuckles]
Describe the--

233
00:19:12,756 --> 00:19:14,757
How about I describe Fort Knox?

234
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:16,392
And what are you going to do?

235
00:19:16,426 --> 00:19:20,428
Are you going to put on your black leotard
and go dangling on a close line?

236
00:19:20,463 --> 00:19:23,130
It's a building full of cops.
What else do you need to know?

237
00:19:23,165 --> 00:19:26,234
And why in the hell
am I talking to you?

238
00:19:26,268 --> 00:19:28,903
Mike, we gotta do something.

239
00:19:30,138 --> 00:19:32,374
I am doing something.

240
00:19:32,408 --> 00:19:34,775
He's good with this stuff.
Just give him a chance.

241
00:19:34,809 --> 00:19:36,943
Now, you look.

242
00:19:36,978 --> 00:19:40,146
That laptop might as well
be on the Moon.

243
00:19:40,181 --> 00:19:41,815
They build these evidence rooms

244
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:44,551
like bank vaults
because guess what.

245
00:19:44,586 --> 00:19:47,621
Lunatics like you
want to break into them.

246
00:19:47,655 --> 00:19:53,466
But unlike a bank vault this is a place
that is guarded 24 hours a day

247
00:19:53,494 --> 00:19:55,327
by the police.

248
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:57,764
There's no way you're
getting it out of there.

249
00:19:57,798 --> 00:20:04,804
Who said that we have to
get it out of there?

250
00:20:04,838 --> 00:20:07,439
We just need to destroy
what's on it.

251
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,241
Oh, so now you want
to blow up a police station.

252
00:20:10,276 --> 00:20:12,176
I don't believe
I said that, no.

253
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:15,113
Nursing home full of old folks
just whet your appetite.

254
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:16,481
Now you want to kill
a bunch of cops.

255
00:20:16,516 --> 00:20:18,983
I've never said anything
about killing anybody.

256
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:22,120
I am, however, considering
the possibility of a device.

257
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:24,422
- A device.
- Yes, a small device.

258
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:27,625
Say this device
gets filed into evidence.

259
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:29,226
Now, it is inside that room.

260
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,628
What about a magnet?

261
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:31,896
You want to commit
a whole other crime

262
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:33,831
just to get this bomb
of yours into evidence.

263
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:35,933
Who said bomb?
I said a device.

264
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:38,201
- Yo, what about, like, a magnet?
- An incendiary device.

265
00:20:38,236 --> 00:20:40,036
One quick fire
is all it would take.

266
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,704
You don't think they have
fire suppression?

267
00:20:41,739 --> 00:20:42,906
I'm not talking
about sprinklers.

268
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:46,241
I'm talking about halon, because
halon doesn't destroy evidence.

269
00:20:46,275 --> 00:20:47,910
- A magnet, though, maybe like--
- All right, so a bomb, then.

270
00:20:47,944 --> 00:20:50,278
Maybe we plant a bomb outside.

271
00:20:50,313 --> 00:20:52,614
Oh, actually I knew
a crew out of Fort Worth

272
00:20:52,649 --> 00:20:55,083
that tried to blow up an
evidence room from outside.

273
00:20:55,117 --> 00:20:57,553
About all they did was
take out a couple of hedges.

274
00:20:57,587 --> 00:20:59,955
You are probably talking
about 2 feet

275
00:20:59,989 --> 00:21:01,656
of reinforced concrete.

276
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:03,290
Or what about a magnet?

277
00:21:03,325 --> 00:21:05,660
What magnet?
What about it?

278
00:21:05,694 --> 00:21:08,496
You know, just a...
[Whooshes, smacks]

279
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:09,864
[Pops]

280
00:21:23,077 --> 00:21:26,480
[Walt] So what do you think?

281
00:21:26,514 --> 00:21:27,647
Expensive.

282
00:21:27,682 --> 00:21:29,983
Leaving aside engineering,

283
00:21:30,017 --> 00:21:32,953
rigging some kind of
alternate power source,

284
00:21:32,987 --> 00:21:36,989
my primary sticking point
is I actually need the thing,

285
00:21:37,023 --> 00:21:38,557
as you gentlemen can see,

286
00:21:38,592 --> 00:21:40,025
it's paying the bills.

287
00:21:40,059 --> 00:21:43,596
But I mean it's
feasible, doable?

288
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:45,030
Hey, we're living in a time

289
00:21:45,064 --> 00:21:47,867
of, uh, string theories
and God particles.

290
00:21:47,901 --> 00:21:51,002
Feasible, doable?
Yeah, sure, why not?

291
00:21:51,036 --> 00:21:52,370
Expensive.

292
00:21:54,106 --> 00:22:00,812
What would you put it in?

293
00:22:00,846 --> 00:22:03,715
What about that?
Does it run?

294
00:22:03,749 --> 00:22:05,949
We can get it running.

295
00:22:05,984 --> 00:22:08,418
What's the box made of?

296
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:10,420
Plywood and aluminum--
just what you need.

297
00:22:12,624 --> 00:22:15,025
All right,
so you want to talk money?

298
00:22:17,194 --> 00:22:18,529
Step into my office.

299
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,967
[Walt]
Hey, listen. Um...

300
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:28,704
I don't actually have
any money right now.

301
00:22:30,106 --> 00:22:34,076
My wife-- There's
an IRS issue anyway.

302
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:36,345
I'd appreciate it if you
could spot me my share.

303
00:22:36,379 --> 00:22:40,081
- I'll pay you back.
- Yeah, whatever.

304
00:22:40,115 --> 00:22:41,416
Right.

305
00:22:44,186 --> 00:22:45,453
You coming?

306
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:47,856
If you have any brains,

307
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:49,424
you'll take that money you save

308
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:51,660
and you'll skip town--

309
00:22:51,694 --> 00:22:53,528
Today. Right now.

310
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,597
You don't think this can work?

311
00:22:56,631 --> 00:22:59,166
Is that a serious question?

312
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,301
Mike,
this is a three-man job.

313
00:23:01,335 --> 00:23:03,136
The only way I know
it won't work for sure

314
00:23:03,171 --> 00:23:04,738
is if we don't have you.

315
00:23:36,836 --> 00:23:38,236
[Knock on door] [Gasps]

316
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:40,005
[Sighs] Come in.

317
00:23:42,374 --> 00:23:43,774
[Whispering]
Oh. Get in.

318
00:23:43,809 --> 00:23:45,743
Close the door.

319
00:23:45,777 --> 00:23:48,546
[Normal voice] What did we
say about you coming here?

320
00:23:48,581 --> 00:23:51,616
Yeah, speaking of things
that tend to rile you up,

321
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:54,419
uh, the police--They may call.

322
00:23:54,453 --> 00:23:56,087
Let me--
let me back up a little.

323
00:23:56,122 --> 00:23:58,522
Can I s-- can I sit down?
I'm going to sit down.

324
00:23:58,556 --> 00:24:01,558
Okay, w-w-why are
the police going to call?

325
00:24:01,593 --> 00:24:04,495
May call you. Distant,
outside possibility.

326
00:24:04,529 --> 00:24:07,697
But on the off chance I want you
thinking one thought--

"I know nothing.
I see nothing."

330

Do you remember how he--
I want you like that.

331
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:20,009
- Okay, Saul, why are the police--
- There was a incident, with Beneke...

332
00:24:20,043 --> 00:24:21,710
Oh, God.

333
00:24:21,745 --> 00:24:24,514
- And it's--
- Oh, Jesus. What incident?

334
00:24:24,548 --> 00:24:26,048
An act of God.

I mean, it just--
that's the best phrase.

337
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:34,689
It fits, but we got a problem.

No. No, no.

What's up with that,
by the way?

352
00:25:16,418 --> 00:25:18,185
Why would anybody
wanna put a metal ring

353
00:25:18,219 --> 00:25:19,553
through the end of the prick?

You want that plastic working,
come Miller Time.

You know, I can foresee a lot of
possible outcomes to this thing,

involves Miller Time.

How many batteries is this?

so 21 times 12, 252 volts.

00:36:00,922 --> 00:36:03,624
I'm supposed to
take that on faith?

495
00:36:03,658 --> 00:36:05,426
Yeah?

496
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,727
Why?

497
00:36:06,761 --> 00:36:09,897
How do we know?

498
00:36:09,931 --> 00:36:11,398
Because I say so.

Roofing hammer.

503
00:36:48,396 --> 00:36:50,630
Undamaged. Bag still sealed.

Samsung laptop computer.

507
00:37:03,543 --> 00:37:06,879
Damaged. Glass screen
is broken and in pieces.

508
00:37:06,914 --> 00:37:08,447
Bag still sealed.

509
00:37:16,957 --> 00:37:20,559
11-58-73317.

510
00:37:20,594 --> 00:37:22,027
Fring, Gustavo.

Framed photograph of two men.

[Glass rattles] Damaged.

513
00:37:24,897 --> 00:37:27,132
The glass is broken,

514
00:37:27,166 --> 00:37:29,335
and photo has slipped
out of its frame.

515
00:37:29,369 --> 00:37:32,871
Bag appears to be slightly
punctured by broken glass.

516
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,574
Hm. Check it out.

517
00:37:38,777 --> 00:37:40,144
That's not on the manifest.

518
00:37:41,847 --> 00:37:43,381
[Saul] All right, so first off,

519
00:37:43,415 --> 00:37:45,082
I'm not a marriage counselor.

520
00:37:45,117 --> 00:37:46,684
Nor do I takes sides
in this thing.

521
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:51,222
And, not taking sides, mind you, but
you did put her in charge of your money,

522
00:37:51,257 --> 00:37:54,258
which I advised against,
if you'll recall,

523
00:37:54,292 --> 00:37:57,294
all of which is not to be
construed as an "I told you so".

524
00:37:57,328 --> 00:37:59,964
I'm just walking you
through my mental process,

525
00:37:59,998 --> 00:38:01,899
so to speak.

526
00:38:05,536 --> 00:38:07,537
So she comes to me
with a problem.

527
00:38:07,572 --> 00:38:09,205
She's been cooking
Beneke's books,

528
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,774
he's in Dutch with the IRS,

529
00:38:10,808 --> 00:38:12,108
and once they audit,

530
00:38:12,143 --> 00:38:14,144
it's "Rio de caca"
for the both of them,

531
00:38:14,178 --> 00:38:18,648
to which I say "hey, let's involve
Walt in this discussion,"

532
00:38:18,682 --> 00:38:21,751
to which she says, "no,
let's cut Beneke a check

533
00:38:21,786 --> 00:38:23,753
so's he can pay off the IRS."

534
00:38:23,787 --> 00:38:25,687
Again, not taking sides,

535
00:38:25,721 --> 00:38:27,956
but she really was
trying to protect you.

536
00:38:31,194 --> 00:38:33,528
A little feedback here
might be nice.

537
00:38:35,598 --> 00:38:38,767
"Let's involve Walt
in this discussion."

538
00:38:38,802 --> 00:38:40,467
Yeah, that's what I told her.

539
00:38:40,502 --> 00:38:41,903
She said no.

540
00:38:41,937 --> 00:38:44,238
And you didn't argue the point.

541
00:38:44,273 --> 00:38:46,307
You didn't think to contact me.

542
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,144
You were a tad preoccupied

543
00:38:50,179 --> 00:38:52,579
at the time, if you'll recall.

544
00:38:52,614 --> 00:38:57,317
Okay. So you took it
upon yourself

545
00:38:57,351 --> 00:39:02,222
to give away $622,000
of my money

546
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:05,758
to a man who had been
sleeping with my wife.

547
00:39:05,793 --> 00:39:09,930
She's my client, same as you.

548
00:39:09,964 --> 00:39:12,898
Does this arrangement get
a little tricky at times?

549
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:17,402
Absolutely. But I try my best,
you know, ethically, my duty...

550
00:39:17,437 --> 00:39:22,507
Ethically? I'm sorry, I must be
hearing things.

551
00:39:22,542 --> 00:39:27,479
Did you actually just use the
word "ethically" in a sentence?

552
00:39:27,513 --> 00:39:29,981
You're not Clarence Darrow,
Saul.

553
00:39:30,015 --> 00:39:32,583
You're a two-bit
bus-bench lawyer,

554
00:39:32,617 --> 00:39:34,252
and you work for me.

555
00:39:34,286 --> 00:39:36,654
Yeah, well, Clarence didn't ever
have a client like you

556
00:39:36,688 --> 00:39:38,656
ask him for something...

557
00:39:40,326 --> 00:39:41,425
like this.

558
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:44,828
Okay? Yeah, I put my ass
on the line for you.

559
00:39:44,863 --> 00:39:46,496
Huell, too. Huh?

560
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:48,131
He's got fingers like hotdogs.

561
00:39:48,166 --> 00:39:49,900
He could've easily busted
this in two

562
00:39:49,934 --> 00:39:53,237
and killed everyone in the
office, but do I complain?

563
00:39:53,271 --> 00:39:56,073
No. Beg, borrow, or steal,
I'm your huckleberry.

564
00:39:56,107 --> 00:39:58,976
I go the extra mile.

565
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:03,346
Only you never told me that the kid
would wind up in the hospital.

566
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:05,447
You know--

567
00:40:05,482 --> 00:40:07,950
Take that thing and get
the hell out of here.

568
00:40:07,985 --> 00:40:09,418
You and me, we're done.

569
00:40:27,169 --> 00:40:28,836
Come on. Hey.

570
00:40:28,871 --> 00:40:30,171
Hey.

571
00:40:32,607 --> 00:40:33,740
H--

572
00:40:35,443 --> 00:40:37,177
We're done

573
00:40:37,212 --> 00:40:39,513
when I say we're done.

574
00:41:19,786 --> 00:41:21,186
[Holly squeaks]

575
00:41:30,096 --> 00:41:31,629
I heard what happened to Ted.

576
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:36,234
He's not going to talk.

577
00:41:36,269 --> 00:41:37,768
Yeah.

578
00:42:03,294 --> 00:42:04,894
I forgive you.
