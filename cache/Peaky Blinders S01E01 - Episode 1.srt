1
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,670
Sir? This is her.

2
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,790
The girl who tells fortunes?

3
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:05,590
They're doing a magic spell
to make her win a race.

4
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:17,590
The horse's name's Monaghan Boy.
Kempton, three o'clock, Monday.

5
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:20,990
You ladies have a bet yourselves
but don't tell anyone else.

6
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:49,350
"And Abraham made his home in a cave,

7
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,510
"but it was good

8
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:54,270
"because God resided there with him.

9
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:57,190
"You see, children, God does not care

10
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:00,910
"if you live in a slum
or in a mansion.

11
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:05,150
"God does not care
if you are rich or you are poor.

12
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,150
"You are still God's..."

13
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,830
Morning, sir.

14
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,630
Morning, Mr Shelby.

15
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:04,340

16
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:12,350
Come on, lad. Morning, sir.

17
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:14,550
Morning, Mr Shelby.
Come on, hurry up!

18
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,470
Finn?

19
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,710
Arthur's mad as hell.

20
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:42,350
What does a ten-year-old
know about hell, eh?

21
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,110
I'm 11 Sunday.

22
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:59,710
Place your bets here now
for the 2:30 at Kempton.

23
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,510
Down to fours...

24
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:09,750
OK, girls and boys,
you want to push that now, mate.

25
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:13,630
Thanks very much.

26
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:19,550
2-1, get your bets in now.

27
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:23,390
What d'you say? We've got Sovereign,
he's an old favourite, 4-1.

28
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,830
Tommy. Tommy!

29
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:30,630
Tommy, look at the book. Just look.

30
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,230
Tommy! All on Monaghan Boy.
Good work, John.

31
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:36,390
Tommy! Get in here, now!

32
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:41,510
That'll be six pennies, Nipper.
That's ten bob you'll see for that.

33
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:54,990
You was seen doing the powder trick
down at Garrison Court.

34
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,150
Times are hard.

35
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:59,110
People need a reason to lay a bet.

36
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,150
There was a Chinese.

37
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:05,590
The washer women say she's a witch.
It helps them believe.

38
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:07,510
We don't mess with Chinese.

39
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,950
Look at the book...

40
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:11,870
Chinese have cutters of their own.

41
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,150
We agreed, Arthur.

42
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,990
I'm taking charge
of drumming up new money.

43
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:21,550
What if Monaghan Boy wins, Tommy?

44
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:24,630
You fixing races now?

45
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:28,550
Do you have permission from Billy
Kimber to be fixing races, hm?

46
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:30,990
Then what's got into you?

47
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:37,270
You think we can take on
the Chinese and Billy Kimber.

48
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,390
Billy's got a bloody army!

49
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:43,350
I think... Arthur. That's what I do.

50
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,470
I think...

51
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,350
so that you don't have to.

52
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,990
There's news from Belfast.

53
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,950
Down from tens over eights...

54
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:06,870
I'm calling a family council
tonight at eight o'clock.

55
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,190
I want all of us there.

56
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:11,710
You hear me?!
There's trouble coming.

57
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,990
All right, shut up now. Shut up.

58
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,790
Comrades...

59
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:22,150
we're here today to take
a vote on strike action. MEN: Yes!

60
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:24,310
But before we have a show
of hands for that...

61
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:28,790
let's have a show of hands
from all those who fought in France,

62
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:32,190
all those who stood side-by-side
with your comrades

63
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:35,430
and watched your comrades fall.
Raise your hands.

64
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:43,590
The blood shed on Flanders fields,

65
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,870
the sweat of YOUR brows!

66
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,390
Who reaps the rewards?

67
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,750
No.

68
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,870
No!

69
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:57,030
- Who, then? Do they stand among us?
- No!

70
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:01,150
Or do they sit at home, comfortable,
with a full belly

71
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:06,070
while you scrape to find enough to
put shoes on your children's feet!

72
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:09,550
Yes!
And what is the reward they offer
you for your sacrifices made?

73
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:13,270
A fucking cut in your wages!

74
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:15,270
THAT is your reward!

75
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:17,830
Raise a hand, all those
who want to strike!

76
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:20,670
Yeah!

77
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:14,630
On the house, Mr Shelby.

78
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:36,750
I'll take a mild. Right.

79
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:58,870
Cheers, Thomas.

80
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:00,030
Good health to you.

81
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,990
The crown of a prince.

82
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:14,150
Soon to be King, I'd bet.
You don't bet.

83
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:17,830
No, but these past few days
I've been speculating.

84
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:22,990
About what?

85
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:26,470
One of my Union comrades
has a sister,

86
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:29,350
works in the telegraph office
at the BSA factory.

87
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:32,190
She says over the past week
they've had messages

88
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:36,190
coming up from London to the brass -
from Winston Churchill himself.

89
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:43,110
Something about a robbery.

90
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,710
"A robbery of national
significance", it said.

91
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:52,590
She found the list of names
left on the telegraph machine.

92
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,790
And on that list was your name
and my name together.

93
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:04,630
What kind of a list would have
the name of a Communist and the name
of a bookmaker side-by-side?

94
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:12,510
Perhaps it's a list of men
who give false hope to the poor.

95
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:16,950
The only difference
between you and me, Freddie,

96
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:18,990
is that sometimes...

97
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:20,710
my horses stand a chance of winning.

98
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:31,070
You know, there are days
when I hear about the cuttings

99
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:34,830
and beatings that I really wish I'd
let you take that bullet in France.

100
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:39,710
Believe me, there are nights
I wish you had.

101
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:52,390
They're going to get me!
On three. One, two, three, down!

102
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,990
Breathe, Danny, breathe!

103
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:58,310
They're going to kill me!

104
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,430
Danny!

105
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:02,990
Danny! Danny, you're home.
We're all home in England.

106
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,950
You're not in France.

107
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:08,790
You're not an artillery shell,
Danny, you're a man. Eh?

108
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:11,990
You're not a whizz bang.
You're a human being, Danny.

109
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:16,870
You're all right, you're all right,
you're all right.

110
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,830
Up! Up!

111
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:25,430
It's all right, it's all right.

112
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:31,550
Oh, hell. Did I do it again?

113
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:34,910
You did it again, Danny.

114
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:39,590
Got to stop doing this, man.

115
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:43,630
It's all right.
Oh, God, Mr Shelby, I'm sorry...

116
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:47,030
It's all right. You go home
to your wife now, Danny.

117
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:49,990
Try and get all that smoke
and mud out of your head, eh.

118
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,710
Yes, Mr Shelby. I'm sorry.

119
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:54,350
Go on.

120
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:01,390
Mr Shelby, you have to do
something about him.

121
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:02,950
Damn right, Harry.

122
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:05,710
You pay the Peaky Blinders
a lot of money for protection.

123
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:10,030
You're the law around here now,
Tommy, aren't you?

124
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:14,270
Maybe you should put a bullet
in Danny Whizz Bang's head
like they do with mad horses.

125
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:19,590
Maybe you'll have to put a bullet
in my head someday, too.

126
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:33,030
Bring the bill to the Peaky
Blinders. We'll take care of this.

127
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:53,950
Look at the gun.

128
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:56,950
Recognise it?

129
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:00,710
Oof!

130
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:03,310
Get up off your arse,
you mumping pig!

131
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:05,470
Aunt Pol! What the fuck
d'you do that for?!

132
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:09,270
Finn was playing with this this
afternoon by the cut. It was loaded.

133
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:11,350
He nearly blew Ada's tits off.

134
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:13,190
It must've fell out of my pocket.

135
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:17,310
He said he found it on the sideboard
of the betting shop...
with bullets in it.

136
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:20,070
Ma... I must've been drunk.

137
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,070
When are you not drunk?

138
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:25,670
Look, Aunt Pol, I'm sorry.

139
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,710
I'm... I'm sorry.

140
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,710
We'll keep this between ourselves

141
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:33,070
if you swear not to leave guns
lying around.

142
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:40,070
Look, I know having four kids
without a woman is hard.

143
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:42,390
But my boot's harder.
Now, come on, we're late.

144
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,470
'Right,

145
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:49,110
'I've called this family meeting
because I've got some
very important news.'

146
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:52,790
Scudboat and Lovelock got back
from Belfast last night.

147
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,950
They were buying a stallion
to cover their mares.

148
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:59,710
They were in a pub
on the Shankhill Road yesterday,

149
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:02,270
and in that pub,
there was a copper...

150
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,070
handing out these.

151
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:10,870
"If you're over five feet
and can fight, come to Birmingham."

152
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:16,510
They're recruiting Protestant
Irishmen to come over here
as Specials.

153
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:19,750
To do what?
To clean up the city, Ada.

154
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,270
He's a Chief Inspector.

155
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:26,030
The last four years, he's been
clearing the IRA out of Belfast.

156
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:28,350
How do you know so bloody much?

157
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,790
Cos I asked the coppers
on our payroll.

158
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,310
And why didn't you tell me?

159
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,350
I'm telling you.

160
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:39,950
So why are they sending him
to Birmingham?

161
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:42,670
Well, there's been all these
bloody strikes at the BSA...

162
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:44,630
and the Austin works lately.

163
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:47,230
Now the papers are talking
about sedition.

164
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:49,150
And revolution.

165
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:51,310
I reckon it's Communists he's after.

166
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:54,270
So this copper's going to
leave us alone, right?

167
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:57,950
There are Irishmen in Green Lanes
who left Belfast to get away
from him.

168
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:01,150
They say Catholic men who crossed
him used to disappear in the night.

169
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:04,670
Yeah, but we ain't IRA.
We bloody fought for the King.

170
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:09,430
Anyway, we're Peaky Blinders.
We're not scared of coppers.

171
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:12,870
He's right. If they come for us,
we'll cut them a smile each.

172
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:14,230
So, Arthur...

173
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:16,990
is that it?
What do you think, Aunt Pol?

174
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,790
This family does everything open.

175
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:23,470
You've nothing more to say
to this meeting, Thomas?

176
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:24,590
No.

177
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:27,590
Nothing that's women's business.

178
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:31,830
This whole bloody enterprise
was women's business
while you boys were away at war.

179
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:33,590
What's changed?

180
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:36,550
We came back.

181
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:41,150
And the Lord will smite the unholy
when the great judgment comes.

182
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:43,870
And judgment is coming, my friends.

183
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:47,030
Judgment is coming
to this wicked city.

184
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:51,630
And your wickedness and your
fornication will be revealed.

185
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:54,790
You cannot hide from the Creator.

186
00:17:54,790 --> 00:18:01,110
You cannot hide from the Almighty
Himself. The Creator sees all.

187
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:04,870
You cannot hide
from the true and living God...

188
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:06,390
Get off with yer!

189
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,390
Fuck off!

190
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,950
That's it, I don't go any further.

191
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,830
I have ten minutes.
What do you want?

192
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,470
An explanation.

193
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:05,110
I've always been able to tell when
you're hiding something.

194
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:09,110
People round here talk.

195
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:12,950
Some of them work at the BSA.

196
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:15,670
I've been talking to the wives
of factory hands.

197
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:18,830
Detectives have been asking questions
in the proofing shops.

198
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:24,510
Nothing happens in that factory
without you knowing about it.

199
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:26,630
Speak.

200
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:28,750
God and Aunt Polly are listening.

201
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:40,630
It was meant to be routine.

202
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:46,830
I had a buyer in London
for some... motorcycles.

203
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:50,990
I asked my men to steal me four
bikes with petrol engines.

204
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:55,430
I'm guessing my men were drunk.

205
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:59,150
There's a still inside the factory
makes tram-line gin.

206
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:05,270
They picked up the wrong
fucking crate.

207
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:10,350
The boys dropped it at Charlie
Strong's yard as agreed.

208
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:12,590
They must've taken it from
the proofing bay

209
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:14,110
instead of the export bay.

210
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:22,790
Holy sweet baby of Mary!

211
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:25,990
Inside we found 25 Lewis
machine guns,

212
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:28,950
10,000 rounds of ammunition,

213
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:33,190
50 semi-automatic rifles,
200 pistols with shells.

214
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,470
Jesus, Tommy!

215
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:37,470
All bound for Libya.

216
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,590
Sitting right there in Charlie
Strong's yard.

217
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:47,630
Tell me you threw them in the cut.

218
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:50,110
We put 'em in the stables,
out of the rain.

219
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,950
The guns hadn't been greased yet.

220
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:58,710
So that's why they sent a copper
from Belfast.

221
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,630
Maybe, maybe not.

222
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:07,390
Thomas, you're a bookmaker,
a robber, a fighting man,

223
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:09,030
you're not a fool.

224
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:12,630
You sell those guns to anyone who
has use to 'em, you will hang!

225
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,870
Dump them somewhere the police
can find them.

226
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:23,870
Maybe if they know they haven't
fallen into the wrong hands

227
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:25,510
this might blow over.

228
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:27,670
Tell Charlie to dump them tonight.

229
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:31,910
No. He won't move contraband
under a full moon.

230
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:34,310
Three days until it wanes.

231
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:36,510
Then you'll do the right thing?

232
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:43,750
You have your mother's common sense,
but your father's devilment.

233
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,830
I see them fighting.

234
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,710
Let your mother win.

235
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:42,750
I got tickets for the Penny Crush.
They're showing a Tom Mix picture.

236
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,230
I'm not in the mood for the pictures
tonight, Ada.

237
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:48,670
Well, I'm not doing it here again.
I got covered in mud last time.

238
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:50,390
Let's just walk a bit.

239
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:52,830
If we go down as far as Greet,
we could go to a pub.

240
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:55,310
Your brothers have friends in Greet.

241
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:58,150
They have friends everywhere.
We'd have to walk to London.

242
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:01,830
I'm with you because you're the only
man round here not scared of them.

243
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:04,030
Oh, I'm scared of them all right.

244
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:06,550
But you love me more than
you fear them, right?

245
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:10,270
I don't want to be
always sneaking about.

246
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:13,710
Soon, we'll tell them. When?

247
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:20,310
How did the family meeting go?

248
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:27,030
Usual. There's a new copper coming.
I heard.

249
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,870
Hmm. And Tommy says he's after
the likes of you.

250
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:35,230
So maybe you should burn your books
and stop making speeches.

251
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:37,510
Oh, my Ada.

252
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:41,990
The only princess of the royal
family of the Kingdom of Small Heath.

253
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:44,750
I'm just a poor communist frog
with a big mouth.

254
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:51,670
Give me a kiss, Princess Ada.
SHE LAUGHS

255
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:36,310
I'm here about the job as a barmaid.

256
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:41,590
Are you mad? Am I what?

257
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:45,430
Do you know about this place?
I saw it in an advertisement.

258
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:48,230
Job's been filled.
It was in yesterday's paper.

259
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:50,990
Believe me, love,
I'm doing you a favour.

260
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:54,310
I'm not asking for favours,
I'm asking for employment.

261
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:00,830
You're too... nice.

262
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:04,350
How would you know? And too pretty.

263
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:06,590
They'd have you up against a wall.

264
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:10,030
I have experience and references.

265
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:16,870
What part of Ireland are you from?

266
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:19,190
Galway. Ah!

267
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:20,710
I worked in Dublin.

268
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:24,030
Me mother was from Galway.

269
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:28,310
You're too pretty.

270
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:30,950
Watch.

271
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:32,830
And listen.

272
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:41,030

279
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,710
Well, I hope you know
a lot of songs.

280
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:15,630
Babies...

281
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:20,110
discarded... with the fish bones
and eggshells.

282
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:26,310
Girls, 11 years old...

283
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:32,950
pierced and punctured by old men
for thruppence a time!

284
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:36,510
Rutted upon like animals!

285
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:39,110
Degradation.

286
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:44,750
Fathers with their daughters,
brothers and sisters sharing beds.

287
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:49,030
Beggars and thieves left to run
in the streets.

288
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:54,870
And astride the whole stinking
pile of wounds and rotten flesh...

289
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:58,190
your masters!

290
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:01,230
The men who you touch your cap to.

291
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:05,390
The Peaky Blinders!

292
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:11,270
The vicious... merciless gangs

293
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:17,190
who blind those that see and cut out
the tongues of those who talk.

294
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:20,870
You are worse than them!

295
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:28,470
Those of you who have taken their
bribes these years since the war,

296
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:35,510
those of you who look the other way,
you... are worse than them!

297
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:40,670
God damn you for soiling
your uniforms!

298
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:51,390
And then... there are the IRA Fenians
and the Communists.

299
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:54,030
Blacker hearts still.

300
00:28:54,030 --> 00:29:01,150
They feed on the puss of all this
corruption like maggots in a corpse.

301
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:07,350
And like maggots, if left to swell
they will eventually swarm like flies

302
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:13,310
and spread their rotten philosophy
across the country
and across the world!

303
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:18,110
Those then... are our enemies!

304
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:22,110
A three-headed beast.

305
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:27,270
It is my job to decapitate each one
and by God I will do it!

306
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:36,950
I don't trust any of yous
until you earn my trust!

307
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:41,150
And that takes some earning.

308
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:49,070
These are the new men
who will bolster your ranks.

309
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:52,670
Good men...

310
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:55,110
from God-fearing families.

311
00:29:57,310 --> 00:30:02,550
By the time the sun sets, they will
be sworn in and in uniform.

312
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:06,230
And by sunrise tomorrow,
they will be on the streets.

313
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:12,910
God help those who stand in our way!

314
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:20,390
Sorry, Mr Shelby.

315
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:24,030
Right. Move out of the way for Mr
Shelby. Mr Shelby. This way.

316
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:28,230
You see, ladies,

317
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:31,790
when you're out with a Blinder,
you don't have to queue.

318
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:39,590
Right... I want a blow job
off both of you

319
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:42,030
before they let
the ordinary people in.

320
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:44,110
Away you go. Take your hat off.

321
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,830
What the fuck?!

322
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:48,430
Who the fuck are you?!

323
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:51,310
I'm Arthur-fucking-Shelby!

324
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:16,390
Arthur Shelby.

325
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:20,310
Lead pack dog of the Peaky Blinders.

326
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:33,590
Look at me.

327
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,790
Bastard!

328
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:03,710
Your uniform?

329
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:05,870
Terrifying, I'm sure.

330
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:11,430
Did he have a gun? No gun. A knife
in his sock, cosh in his belt.

331
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:18,830
Now, Mr Shelby...

332
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:24,030
I want you to see this as me
introducing myself to you.

333
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:26,070
Understand?

334
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:32,470
In all the world the only thing
that interests me is the truth.

335
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:34,430
So...

336
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:39,430
what do you know about the robbery?

337
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:41,190
What robbery?

338
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:52,030
I will ask you again.

339
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:56,830
What do you know... about
the robbery?

340
00:32:56,830 --> 00:33:00,830
I swear to God, I don't know
what you're talking about.

341
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:03,070
What fucking robbery?

342
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:07,550
Argh!

343
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:18,310
Aye, after 35 years of dealing
with animals like you,

344
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:23,630
I can tell just by sniffing the
air... whether or not you're lying.

345
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:27,270
I'm not fucking lying!

346
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:29,870
All right? I'm not fucking lying!

347
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:40,230
I know.

348
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:47,670
I see nothing of interest behind
the blood in your eyes.

349
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:50,670
And no blood in your veins

350
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:55,910
that could carry... even a trace
of cunning or guile.

351
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:59,830
But understand this.

352
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:08,310
It is well within my power to have
you and the rest of your scum family

353
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:11,550
face down in the canal
before the year is out.

354
00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:17,390
On the other hand...

355
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:22,470
we can help each other.

356
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:41,630
Is it always this busy on a daytime?
No. These boys are on their way
to St Andrews.

357
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:45,470
To pray? That'll be the day.
St Andrews is a football ground.

358
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:48,510
The Blues are playing.
That's the forward line there.

359
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:51,790
And that's the goalie,
believe it or not. Hello!

360
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:58,310
I need a bottle of rum.

361
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:01,070
Grace, whatever it is,
it's on the house.

362
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:04,350
A whole bottle? Yeah.
White or dark rum? Don't care.

363
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:06,750
Right, lads, what'll it be? Two?

364
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:09,790
Thank you.

365
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:13,230
Harry said it's on the house.

366
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:16,830
Are you a whore?

367
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:23,030
Cos if you're not,
you're in the wrong place.

368
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:31,790
He's one of them
you warned me about?

369
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:35,110
Look, Grace, you're a friendly girl
but be careful.

370
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:38,950
If I say something's on the house,
then say nothing
to whoever you're serving.

371
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:43,630
If they decide that they want you,
then there's nothing
anybody could do about it.

372
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:48,070
Lucky for you, since he got back
from France, Tommy doesn't want
anybody at all.

373
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:49,710
Yes, lads?

374
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:56,030
John, wipe the blood out of his eye.
Since when did you give orders?

375
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:59,750
I'm a trained nurse. Don't make me
laugh, it hurts me face.

376
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:03,550
I bloody am! You went to one
first-aid class in the church hall

377
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:05,270
and got thrown out for giggling.

378
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:09,350
Not before I learnt how to stop
somebody from choking.
I'm not bloody choking, am I?

379
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:12,430
You will be when I wrap this cloth
round your neck.

380
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:14,710
Let me see him.

381
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:16,670
All right, have this.

382
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:21,070
Give me that.

383
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:26,670
You're all right.

384
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:32,030
He said Mr Churchill
sent him to Birmingham.

385
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:35,870
National interest, he said.

386
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:38,030
Something about a robbery.

387
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:44,350
He said he wants us to help him.
We don't help coppers.

388
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:47,350
He knew all about our war records.

389
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:50,790
He said we're patriots... like him.

390
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:55,230
He wants us to be his eyes and ears.

391
00:36:56,990 --> 00:37:00,270
I said...

392
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:04,830
I said we'd have a family meeting
and take a vote.

393
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:18,230
Well, why not? Hmm? We've no truck
with Fenians or communists.

394
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:25,950
What's wrong with you?

395
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:28,750
What the fuck is wrong
with him lately?!

396
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:32,550
If I knew, I'd buy the cure
from Compton's Chemists.

397
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:36,590

409

410
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:36,790
Why do you think that is, Harry?

411
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:16,110
So did Arthur say what kind of deal
this new copper offered him?

412
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:21,590
God! The second your balls are empty
it's back onto politics.

413
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:30,830
What did Tommy say?

414
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:33,710
He didn't say anything.
You know what he's like.

415
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:35,390
Yeah, I know what he's like.

416
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:37,790
He likes to take his fights
onto the mud.

417
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:39,670
Doesn't like to stand and wait.

418
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:42,390
You know what he'd do
if he found out about us.

419
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:43,910
He could try.

420
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:46,950
Sometimes, it's like you're with me
just to show you can.

421
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:53,390
One day me and Tommy will be
on the same side again.

422
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:17,350
Tommy...! Aargh.

423
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:20,870
Hey, what you do?
We're closed. Go home.

424
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:25,270
Go home, crazy man.

425
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:27,350
I said go home, crazy man!

426
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:31,910
I said go home.

427
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:33,870
Fix bayonets!!!

428
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:11,750
Secretary of State,
this is Chief Inspector Campbell.

429
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:21,270
Mr Churchill, sir, may I say what
a great honour it is to meet you.

430
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:24,270
Bit of a whistle stop tour.

431
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:29,230
Love the hat, by the way.
Thank you. It's beaver.

432
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:33,550
So, how are you settling in?

433
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:36,910
I have set up a command network.

434
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:39,470
I have agents in place
across the city

435
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:42,190
who will act as my eyes and ears.

436
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:47,630
And I have begun to interrogate
suspects vigorously.

437
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:53,870
You were in Belfast. I understand
you broke a few Fenian hearts.

438
00:43:53,870 --> 00:43:55,470
A rat's nest, sir.

439
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:59,990
So who do you think stole the guns?
Fenians or Communists?

440
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:05,110
If it is IRA Fenians, I will
find them and find the guns.

441
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:08,430
If it is Communists, I will find them
and find the guns.

442
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:12,750
If it is common criminals,
I will find them and find the guns.

443
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:15,830
To me there are no distinction
between any of the above.

444
00:44:18,310 --> 00:44:20,870
We chose you
because you are effective.

445
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:24,590
But remember this, Mr Campbell.
This is England, not Belfast.

446
00:44:24,590 --> 00:44:28,790
Bodies thrown in the rivers,
wash up in the papers here.

447
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:32,110
We must keep the existence of these
stolen guns out of the news

448
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:35,110
otherwise we will simply be
advertising them for sale.

449
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:42,990
If there are bodies to be buried,
dig holes and dig them deep.

450
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:48,710
I want everything accounted for
down to the last bullet.

451
00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:05,870
Uncle Charlie, a word.

452
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:08,150
They are aboard. There's no moon.

453
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:12,830
We can take them out to the turning
point beyond Gas Street

454
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:14,830
and leave them on the bank.

455
00:45:14,830 --> 00:45:17,270
They'll be found by railway men
first thing.

456
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:25,350
Is that agreement?

457
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:29,070
I changed my mind.

458
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:31,990
You what?

459
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:35,670
I have an alternative strategy.

460
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:41,270
Tell Curly to take her out
to the old tobacco wharf.

461
00:45:41,270 --> 00:45:44,070
There's a lock up mooring
we used to keep cigarettes.

462
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:46,150
He knows it.

463
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:49,590
When the boat leaves your yard,
it's no longer your concern.

464
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:53,670
Have you lost your fucking mind?

465
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:56,790
Have you not seen the streets?

466
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:59,270
They've sent a fucking army
to find these things...

467
00:45:59,270 --> 00:46:02,270
That's right.
They've shown their hand...

468
00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:03,630
Their hand?

469
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:06,870
If they want them back this bad,
they'll have to pay.

470
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:08,750
That's the way of the world.

471
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:11,630
Fortune drops something
valuable in your lap,

472
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:14,390
you don't just dump it
on the bank of the cut.

473
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:18,870
You're blood, Tommy.

474
00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:21,270
I've always looked out for you
like a dad.

475
00:46:23,390 --> 00:46:26,590
You're going to bring holy hell
down on your head.

476
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:30,430
This copper takes no prisoners.

477
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:33,270
I'm told he didn't serve.

478
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:36,590
Reserved occupation.

479
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:42,030
Is it another war
you're looking for, Tommy?

480
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:46,590
The tobacco wharf.

481
00:46:46,590 --> 00:46:49,230
By order of the Peaky Blinders.

482
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:21,270
Are you in position?

483
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:25,990
I am, sir.

484
00:47:27,870 --> 00:47:29,390
Your first impressions?

485
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:32,550
I am quite shocked at how
these people live.

486
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:38,710
Have you found anything
out that might help me?

487
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:43,310
I interrogated the head of the Peaky
Blinders. He didn't know anything.

488
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:44,950
A brute.

489
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:48,670
It strikes me that it isn't Arthur
who heads the Shelby family.

490
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:51,030
It is the younger one, Thomas.

491
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:57,550
They say he won two medals
for gallantry in the war.

492
00:47:57,550 --> 00:47:59,070
You sound fascinated.

493
00:48:02,270 --> 00:48:05,310
However, my opinion has not changed.

494
00:48:05,310 --> 00:48:07,950
The bookmaker gangs
have other business

495
00:48:07,950 --> 00:48:10,710
and the Communists are too weak
to have planned this.

496
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:14,990
I believe the guns
were taken by the IRA.

497
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:21,990
You must not let your personal
history cloud your judgment.

498
00:48:26,390 --> 00:48:27,830
What history?

499
00:48:29,790 --> 00:48:33,950
That the IRA murdered my father
will not affect my judgment.

500
00:48:38,270 --> 00:48:42,150
If you see any guns, check the
serial numbers against that list.

501
00:48:47,350 --> 00:48:52,950
Your father was the finest officer
I ever worked with.

502
00:48:52,950 --> 00:48:55,790
I know he would be very,
very proud of you.

503
00:49:25,070 --> 00:49:29,870
Danny, as you know, the man
you killed was Italian.

504
00:49:29,870 --> 00:49:32,670
And those two men
over there are his brothers.

505
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:38,830
If I let the Italians do this,
Danny,

506
00:49:38,830 --> 00:49:42,350
they'll cut off your manhood
and let you drain.

507
00:49:42,350 --> 00:49:44,390
That's how those bastards do things.

508
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:49,190
So, to stop a war breaking
out between us and the Italians...

509
00:49:51,670 --> 00:49:54,390
and to save you from
their barbarity...

510
00:49:57,110 --> 00:49:59,910
I said I would
dispatch you myself.

511
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:03,470
They are here to witness.

512
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:14,350
I died over there anyway, Tommy.

513
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:17,070
I left my fucking brains in the mud.

514
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:22,510
You have any last requests, comrade?

515
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:31,270
You'll look out for my Rosie
and my boys?

516
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:39,110
See they get apprenticeships.
At the BSA factory or the Austin.

517
00:50:42,270 --> 00:50:46,030
They'll make foremen.
I know they will.

518
00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:47,750
Just ordinary...

519
00:50:49,470 --> 00:50:50,830
Just ordinary men.

520
00:50:51,910 --> 00:50:54,950
And they won't get told
to do this shit...

521
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:57,870
This shit... This shit
that we got told to do.

522
00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:12,510
I suppose I ought to pray now.

523
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:21,070
Those fucking guns blew God
right out of my head.

524
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:30,110
Is that boat for me?

525
00:51:33,550 --> 00:51:36,350
We have to get your body out
of the city, Danny.

526
00:51:36,350 --> 00:51:37,990
This new copper, you know...

527
00:51:37,990 --> 00:51:41,870
Don't bury me anywhere
where there's mud. OK?

528
00:51:41,870 --> 00:51:43,510
Promise me.

529
00:51:46,390 --> 00:51:49,750
Bury me on a hill
and tell Rosie where.

530
00:51:53,430 --> 00:51:57,070
You were a good man
and a good soldier.

531
00:52:00,990 --> 00:52:02,910
Yes, Sergeant Major.

532
00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:27,310
In the bleak midwinter.

533
00:52:44,990 --> 00:52:47,190
GUNSHOT

534
00:53:16,590 --> 00:53:18,070
Where are you?

535
00:53:21,790 --> 00:53:23,630
It bloody won!

536
00:53:23,630 --> 00:53:26,070
Monaghan Boy bloody won!

537
00:53:27,430 --> 00:53:29,510
Yeah. It won.

538
00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:33,670
And word will spread.

539
00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:37,110
So next time we do the powder trick
it won't just be The Garrison

540
00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:40,470
that'll bet on the horse,
it'll be the whole of Small Heath.

541
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:44,110
And you know what?
The horse will win again.

542
00:53:44,110 --> 00:53:46,310
And the third time we do it

543
00:53:46,310 --> 00:53:48,630
we'll have the whole of Birmingham
betting on it.

544
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:51,950
A thousand quid bet
on the magic horse.

545
00:53:51,950 --> 00:53:57,190
And that time, when we are ready,
the horse will lose.

546
00:54:01,670 --> 00:54:04,070
Think about it.

547
00:54:41,430 --> 00:54:42,910
You OK, Danny?

548
00:54:42,910 --> 00:54:44,830
I'm still in shock.

549
00:54:46,670 --> 00:54:48,990
You sure this isn't heaven?

550
00:54:48,990 --> 00:54:51,390
If it was heaven,
what would I be doing here?

551
00:54:54,710 --> 00:54:56,950
Tommy wanted you to think
it was real

552
00:54:56,950 --> 00:54:59,790
to try and knock some
sense into you.

553
00:54:59,790 --> 00:55:02,590
A shell full of sheep brains
hurts pretty bad.

554
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:04,070
It was meant to.

555
00:55:06,310 --> 00:55:09,150
So where are you taking me?
London.

556
00:55:09,150 --> 00:55:12,390
Tommy has a little job for you.
Give you chance to say thanks.

557
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:19,110
You're a Peaky Blinder now, Danny.

558
00:55:32,510 --> 00:55:33,710
A bad week.

559
00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:39,030
There was no moon last night.
I checked.

560
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:40,830
Did you do the right thing?

561
00:55:40,830 --> 00:55:43,070
Yes, I did the right thing.

562
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:55,360
