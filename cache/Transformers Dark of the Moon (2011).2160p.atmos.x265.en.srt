1
00:00:43,689 --> 00:00:46,363
<i>We were once a peaceful race

2
00:00:46,454 --> 00:00:49,958
<i>of intelligent, mechanical beings.

3
00:00:50,042 --> 00:00:53,012
<i>But then came the war

4
00:00:53,093 --> 00:00:56,643
<i>between the Autobots,
who fought for freedom

5
00:00:56,743 --> 00:01:00,247
<i>and the Decepticons,
who dreamt of tyranny.

6
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:06,175
<i>Overmatched and outnumbered,

7
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:08,949
<i>our defeat was all but certain.

8
00:01:22,732 --> 00:01:25,235
<i>But in the war's final days,

9
00:01:25,325 --> 00:01:28,124
<i>one Autobot ship escaped the battle.

10
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:30,838
<i>It was carrying a secret cargo,

11
00:01:30,938 --> 00:01:33,782
<i>which would have changed
our planet's fate.

12
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:46,402
<i>A desperate mission.

13
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:49,114
<i>Our final hope.

14
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:04,508
<i>A hope that vanished.

15
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:15,102
One up there. One over there.

16
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,312
And one more down there.

17
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,607
What you got?

18
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,742
<i>Impact detected.

19
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:44,423
We have impact confirmed.
Contact at 2250 GMT.

20
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:45,916
What?

21
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,590
Get me SecDef on the
phone right away.

22
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:08,109
<i>Mr McNamara,
the President is expecting you.

23
00:03:09,624 --> 00:03:10,716
Get Bobby in here.

24
00:03:10,804 --> 00:03:13,273
Mr President, designation, top secret.

25
00:03:13,356 --> 00:03:15,529
We believe a UFO has
crashed into the Moon.

26
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,783
We think the Russians
are onto it as well.

27
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:20,368
Well, then you tell NASA
to move heaven and earth.

28
00:03:20,468 --> 00:03:21,685
We need to get to the moon.

29
00:03:22,086 --> 00:03:23,687
<i>We're going to attempt a manned mission.

30
00:03:23,777 --> 00:03:25,700
NASA said it would take five years.

31
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,802
You get there before the Russians.

32
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,378
<i>I believe that this nation
should commit itself

33
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:33,259
<i>to achieving the goal

34
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,716
<i>before this decade is out

<i>Liftoff. We have a liftoff.

40
00:03:51,955 --> 00:03:55,676
<i>Thirty-two minutes past the hour.
Liftoff on Apollo 11.

<i>Neil Armstrong reporting Apollo 11
on proper heading.

Apollo 11 is on the way, riding that

<i>pillar of flame

44

<i>from the Saturn V out there,
250,000 miles away,

46
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:13,438
for man's first arrival.

47
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:18,263
Houston, you're a go for landing.
Over.

48
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:22,812
<i>Forty feet, down two and a half.
Picking up some dust.

49

<i>Thirty feet, two and a half down.
Faint shadow.

<i>Capcom, flight.

Drifting to the right a little.

<i>Okay, engine stop.

<i>Houston, Tranquility Base here.

<i>We copy you down, Eagle.

<i>Perhaps 400 million persons

<i>Okay, I'm gonna step off the LEM now.

65
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:16,237
<i>That's one small step for man,

66
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:20,078
<i>one giant leap for mankind.

67
00:05:21,884 --> 00:05:23,306
- Are we good?
- Yes, sir.

68

<i>Unofficial time on the first step, 109...

<i>Apollo 11? This is Houston, overt.

70

Eagle, we're getting a signal interference.
Do you copy?

71
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:42,701
<i>We now have had confirmation

72
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:43,927
of loss of signal

<i>Mission is a go.

My God.

79

<i>It's some sort of giant metal face.

Jesus.

81
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:59,128
Control, we are inside the ship.

82
00:07:03,148 --> 00:07:05,242
<i>Extensive damage.

83
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:07,970
<i>Way too big to check the entire ship.

84
00:07:13,453 --> 00:07:16,127
Everything's dead in here, Houston.

85
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:18,070
No signs of life anywhere.

86
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,025
These things are massive.

87
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,617
We copy. You've got seven minutes
on your oxygen.

88
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,078
<i>We are not alone after all, are we?

89
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,955
No, sin We're not alone.

90
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,187
<i>Go ahead, Mr President.

91
00:07:34,275 --> 00:07:37,870
<i>Hello, Neil and Buzz.
I'm talking to you by telephone

<i>from the Oval Room
at the White House.

93
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:45,591
<i>And this certainly has to be the most
historic telephone call ever made.

94
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:50,805
<i>I just can't tell you how proud
we all are of you.

95
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:54,892
<i>For every American, this has to
be the proudest day of our lives.

96
00:07:55,871 --> 00:07:57,919
<i>Because of what you have done...

97
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,612
<i>We have splashdown.

98
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:02,257
<i>...the heavens have become a part

99
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:03,950
<i>of man's world.

100
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,328
<i>For one priceless moment

101
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:10,324
<i>in the whole history of man

102
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:15,412
<i>all the people on this Earth
are truly one.

103
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:20,041
<i>One in their pride in
what you have done.

104
00:08:22,144 --> 00:08:24,613
<i>It inspires us to redouble our efforts

105
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:28,308
<i>to bring peace and tranquility to Earth.

106
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:05,379
My hero needs to wake up.

107
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:20,768
What is that?

108
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,942
This is your new lucky bunny.

109
00:09:28,106 --> 00:09:29,386
It's a beautiful thought, Carly,

110
00:09:29,477 --> 00:09:31,855
but I don't think it's the
whole bunny that's lucky.

111
00:09:31,955 --> 00:09:33,753
You see,
it's just this section here.

112
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,410
You see, it's just the
rabbit foot that's lucky.

113
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:42,549
Well, it's just a good luck charm.
To help you think positive?

114
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,418
Today's important.

115
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:47,779
Come on, get up.

116
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:50,007
- Hey, wear that nice tie.
- Yeah.

117
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:52,179
You need any money for lunch?

118
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:57,522
No, I don't need any money for lunch.
I have money from yesterday's lunch.

119
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,813
You love it, don't you? I'm
just your American boy toy.

120
00:10:01,543 --> 00:10:03,420
A lover boy toy.

121
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,433
You know how demoralizing it is
to have saved the world twice

122
00:10:05,484 --> 00:10:06,805
and still be grovelling for a job?

123
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:09,125
People don't know you
saved the world, Sam.

124
00:10:09,198 --> 00:10:10,996
I mean, I do. I believe you.

125
00:10:11,074 --> 00:10:12,951
The government knows. I mean,
they could hook me up with a job

126
00:10:13,028 --> 00:10:14,120
right here in D.C.

127
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,848
I mean, I should be working with the
Autobots, otherwise it's not fair.

128
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:21,126
Come on, they paid for your college.
The President gave you a hero medal.

129
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,299
<i>Thank you, man. Great job.

130
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:28,987
That's the coolest thing
that ever happened to me.

131
00:10:29,075 --> 00:10:30,292
All right, guys.

132
00:10:30,378 --> 00:10:33,131
- What the fuck!
- Wow.

133
00:10:33,231 --> 00:10:36,735
And, as I recall, that wasn't
even the highlight of your day.

134
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,518
Mr Ambassador, here.

135
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,919
British Embassy, you're up next.

136
00:10:46,709 --> 00:10:49,758
No, you don't wear it.
See, you've gotta... The box.

137
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:50,976
I couldn't, even if I wanted to.

138
00:10:51,063 --> 00:10:52,690
You're supposed to leave
it in the box, right?

139
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:55,009
You keep it in this.
What a gorgeous box.

140
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:05,628
Oh, yeah. My medal.
You know who gave that to me?

141
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,259
- Who?
- POTUS.

142
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,508
President of the United States.

143
00:11:15,404 --> 00:11:17,202
Babe, it's hard for
everybody to get a job.

144
00:11:17,293 --> 00:11:19,421
I don't have time. You see,
my parents are gonna be here in a week

145
00:11:19,504 --> 00:11:21,598
on their road trip
Partybus World Tour.

146
00:11:21,698 --> 00:11:23,871
If my dad gets here and
I don't have a job,

147
00:11:24,242 --> 00:11:26,586
he's gonna spank me.
You know, it's go time for me.

148
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,814
All right, tonight, I'll give you a job.

149
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:34,031
Romance me with a nice dinner
and maybe you can get that bonus.

150
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,416
- Get lucky.
- Get him out of here.

151
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:42,627
Wait. No, no, no, no.

152
00:11:43,682 --> 00:11:45,980
- Oh, he's gross!
- She's good.

153
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,868
They're stranded here.
Somebody's got to watch out for them.

154
00:11:47,968 --> 00:11:50,312
Yesterday, that one was
in my underwear drawer.

155
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,462
Did research. Looking real good, too.

156
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,072
No need to hit me.

157
00:11:54,163 --> 00:11:57,167
- You are not a normal boyfriend.
- That's what you love about me.

158
00:11:57,254 --> 00:11:59,382
- Crybaby.
- We're not at the love word yet.

159
00:11:59,482 --> 00:12:02,406
Maybe a little bit closer
when you're covering your half of the rent.

160
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:04,307
Good-bye.

161
00:12:04,915 --> 00:12:07,293
Frickin' shorting my circuits out here!

162
00:12:07,381 --> 00:12:10,851
It's inhumane, what it is!
Make us live in a box

163
00:12:10,934 --> 00:12:14,234
on a balcony, right next to a beast!
Like a common animal!

164
00:12:14,314 --> 00:12:15,406
Stop, okay?

165
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:17,908
You and your creepy sidekick
can't be in here without permission.

166
00:12:17,989 --> 00:12:19,867
According to who?
Miss Blondie Blonde?

167
00:12:19,967 --> 00:12:21,844
Giddyup, little doggie!

168
00:12:24,226 --> 00:12:27,105
- Yo, Brains, wassup?
- Doing good.

169
00:12:27,195 --> 00:12:30,870
Shit, I seen this one.
It's the one where Spock goes nuts.

170
00:12:30,956 --> 00:12:33,835
You know, Sam, I don't know about
moving in with this chick.

171
00:12:33,935 --> 00:12:35,812
What if she dumps us like the last girl?

172
00:12:36,314 --> 00:12:37,907
She was mean. Didn't like her.

173
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,554
Us guys got to stick together.

174
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:42,186
We are family.

175
00:12:44,284 --> 00:12:47,083
No, we are not family.
You're a political refugee,

176
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,503
and I have finally found someone
who appreciates me for me.

177
00:12:49,826 --> 00:12:51,546
Well, you tell her
that we're not your pets,

178
00:12:51,636 --> 00:12:52,933
and we're not your toys!

179
00:12:53,033 --> 00:12:56,162
All right? We're an advanced,
genius alien race just looking for a home.

180
00:12:58,774 --> 00:13:01,055
- Maybe it wasn't such a good idea.
- Didn't have to stop.

181
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,795
Come on.
What're they going to do, tow it?

182
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,371
Where is he?

183
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,377
Sammy!

184
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:10,381
- Come on, that's funny!
- Sam.

185
00:13:10,936 --> 00:13:12,609
I missed you guys so much.

186
00:13:12,697 --> 00:13:14,540
Sure, you did.
What do you think?

187
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:15,877
- Look at that.
- Cute.

188
00:13:15,957 --> 00:13:17,425
- You look old.
- Stop it.

189
00:13:17,488 --> 00:13:18,609
Feel like I can see the end.

190
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:20,773
I love your little tie.
Hey, where's my girl?

191
00:13:20,849 --> 00:13:22,476
- Where's my beautiful Carly?
- She's at work, Ma.

192
00:13:22,555 --> 00:13:24,808
She's got a new job. You guys said
you were gonna be here in a week.

193
00:13:24,886 --> 00:13:26,229
The 21st, not the 11th, Dad, remember?

194
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,648
We just hauled ass in this thing.

195
00:13:27,748 --> 00:13:30,592
- We stopped for gas.
- This thing. The love tub, it flies.

196
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:34,547
Are we keeping you from something?
Like, say, your job?

197
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,991
Well, it's about time.
You had us worried.

198
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,241
I have job interviews.

199
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,456
That's good.

200
00:13:44,758 --> 00:13:45,975
- That sucks.
- Stop it.

201
00:13:46,065 --> 00:13:47,988
You don't have to be so negative, Dad.
You know, you're in D.C.

202
00:13:48,074 --> 00:13:49,326
You're here with your son
and your family.

203
00:13:49,407 --> 00:13:51,375
- I mean, it's a good time.
- It sucks that you don't have a job.

204
00:13:51,453 --> 00:13:53,171
Yeah, but there's good things
to do here, too, right?

205
00:13:53,252 --> 00:13:55,004
Right? Museums and monuments, okay?

206
00:13:55,104 --> 00:13:56,945
- I'll see you tonight.
- I'm bagging the gift.

207
00:13:57,033 --> 00:13:59,502
Sam, I think for an interview
you should wear real pants.

208
00:13:59,587 --> 00:14:01,839
I think for life,
you should wear real pants.

209
00:14:01,923 --> 00:14:04,301
What happened to Bumblebee?

210
00:14:04,368 --> 00:14:06,529
He's off on his missions.
I had to get this for backup.

211
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,319
- Your car has a job, huh?
- Stop.

212
00:14:09,394 --> 00:14:11,192
What does it change into?

213
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:13,317
It doesn't change into anything.
It's a collector's item, Ma.

214
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,362
I got it for a steal.
It just needs some work. Trust me.

215
00:14:15,462 --> 00:14:18,181
No, I think it's darling.
It reminds me a lot of Bumblebee,

216
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:21,277
if Bumblebee were a sad piece of shit.

217
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:26,291
Come on, we'll give you a ride!

218
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:31,020
<i>In the years since our arrival,
our new home, Earth,

219
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,248
<i>has seen much change.

220
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:36,422
<i>Energon detectors guard its cities now.

221
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:40,221
<i>Long-range defence systems
watch the skies.

222
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:46,512
{\an8}<i>So now we assist our allies
in solving human conflicts,

223
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:50,978

224
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:12,704
On the ground, <i>per favore!</i>
And stay there!

225
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:32,183
<i>We work in secret teams on various
missions around the globe.

226
00:15:33,207 --> 00:15:34,709
<i>And all the while

227
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:38,814
<i>we search for signs of our
true enemies' return.

228
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:45,636
<i>I am Voshkod, General Counsel with
Ukrainian Department of Energy.

229
00:15:45,728 --> 00:15:47,605
<i>My government will officially deny

230
00:15:47,693 --> 00:15:49,695
that we're having this conversation.

231
00:15:49,776 --> 00:15:53,246
At one of our decommissioned facilities,
a discovery was made,

232
00:15:53,346 --> 00:15:56,816
which I fear may be alien in nature.

233
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:02,629
The facility's name is Chernobyl.

234
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:22,399
Mr Voshkod.

235
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:25,322
So, uninhabited since '86.

236
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,909
I hear it won't be livable again
for another 20,000 years?

237
00:16:29,134 --> 00:16:32,308
At least.
Ukraine was the most fertile land.

238
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:33,705
It's a tragedy.

239
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,210
This way.

240
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:38,689
Gear up!
We have 60 minutes on the ground.

241
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,837
Watch your radiation levels.

242
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,469
Mr Voshkod, where's your protective gear?

243
00:16:52,032 --> 00:16:54,330
Where's your protective gear?

244
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,522
It would not matter.

245
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:58,334
For me, it's only a matter of time.

246
00:16:58,434 --> 00:16:59,731
Through the school.

247
00:17:01,579 --> 00:17:04,674
Yuri will take you below.
And one other thing, Colonel.

248
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:07,698
In private,
there were some energy experiments.

249
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,077
It can wait.

250
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,677
Keep moving. Stay tight.

251
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:31,884
Okay, right here.
I think I found it.

252
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,137
Optimus, we got a visual.

253
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:41,144
Looks like the object's clamped
in some kind of a metal harness.

254
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:45,231
What's this? Guys!

255
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:47,923
Why does this thing have Soviet
space program markings on it?

256
00:17:49,339 --> 00:17:50,386
<i>Sputnik?

257
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:53,114
Energon readings, sir.
It's strong.

258
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:57,664
Below us. It's coming fast.

259
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,460
Contact, contact!

260
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,517
Get topside now!
Move, move, move!

261
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:51,343
- Let's go!
- Weapons up! Heavy weapons up!

262
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,174
Stay behind me!

263
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:56,685
Optimus!

264
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:03,392
Fall back!

265
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:05,895
It's circling around us!

266
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:07,738
It's taking our flank!

267
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,162
Get the heavy weapon!

268
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:19,326
Optimus!

269
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,059
What the hell was that thing?

270
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:39,437
That

271
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:41,556
is Shockwave.

272
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:44,942
Why was he after this?

273
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:47,354
It's impossible.

274
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:53,110
This is an engine part
from a long lost Autobot ship.

275
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:19,761
Pleasure working with you.

276
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:24,561
Interviews. This is so exciting.

277
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:26,459
Honey, do you want some gum?

278
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,312
Your breath gets really gnarly
when you're nervous.

279
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:33,115
- Mr Witwicky?
- Yeah. Search is over.

280
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:34,992
I'm Mr Whitley.

281
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:37,032
Mr...

282
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:39,622
- Is anybody else joining?
- No.

283
00:20:40,139 --> 00:20:42,016
No? You want me to
move right there?

284
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:43,756
- I'll move right there.
- I'd prefer not.

285
00:20:44,514 --> 00:20:46,187
Ready? Begin.

286
00:20:46,277 --> 00:20:48,700
Graduated this year. Majored in geopolitics.
Minor in tech studies.

287
00:20:48,785 --> 00:20:50,207
Very interested in
government and technology,

288
00:20:50,287 --> 00:20:51,630
how that's gonna intersect and co-exist.

289
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:52,924
Shape the future.

290
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:55,927
Why did we bother sending
him to an Ivy college for?

291
00:20:56,007 --> 00:20:58,260
Three months out of school
and he can't find a job?

292
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:01,097
Mr Masuhisu... Matsumoto.

293
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:02,724
- Matsumoto.
- Moto.

294
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,601
- Martha, can I call you Martha?
- No, you may not.

295
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,603
Okay, Jack, there's two types
of people in this world.

296
00:21:06,703 --> 00:21:09,047
There's thinkers, there's doers.

297
00:21:10,285 --> 00:21:13,255
There's winners, there's dreamers,
and there's buddies.

298
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,357
What about some weaknesses?

299
00:21:16,092 --> 00:21:17,218
I don't...

300
00:21:17,306 --> 00:21:18,523
You have a very trustworthy face.

301
00:21:18,623 --> 00:21:21,046
You remind me of like an
Asian Colonel Sanders.

302
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:22,598
A man I can trust.

303
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:23,670
He's a millennial.

304
00:21:23,747 --> 00:21:26,250
That means they're the, you know,
like lost generation.

305
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:28,193
Why was the FBI looking for you?

306
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,147
The what?

307
00:21:30,207 --> 00:21:31,647
Yeah, FBI.
Good of you to flag that.

308
00:21:31,715 --> 00:21:34,809
It was during all that alien craziness
when you were 14.

309
00:21:34,889 --> 00:21:37,050
I mean, they were very kind to me,
found me in a jiffy.

310
00:21:37,128 --> 00:21:39,972
And that's all been expunged.
Obama gave me a medal, actually.

311
00:21:40,052 --> 00:21:42,555
I'm just saying.
It's always good to have a medal guy

312
00:21:42,655 --> 00:21:44,032
in the office, with a medal.

313
00:21:44,283 --> 00:21:45,705
- From Obama?
- Yeah.

314
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:49,605
In this office,
we're mostly Republicans, so...

315
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,127
I'm not feeling too good.

316
00:21:51,219 --> 00:21:52,220
- No?
- No.

317
00:21:52,307 --> 00:21:54,309
Why don't you get a little dipping
tray and dip the dog in Pepto?

318
00:21:54,393 --> 00:21:55,565
That's a solution.

319
00:21:55,646 --> 00:21:57,068
I got another one. We got to go.

320
00:21:57,168 --> 00:21:58,294
- Come on.
- Really?

321
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:00,782
Sit.

322
00:22:01,257 --> 00:22:05,182
Got myself a Mr Sam Witwicky,
recent college graduate.

323
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:07,785
Previous experience, next to zero,

324
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:11,790
yet he has a recommend letter
from our board?

325
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:14,083
WTF to that.

326
00:22:14,391 --> 00:22:16,610
- Do I know somebody on your board?
- Here's the deal.

327
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,623
You know who we are.
Accuretta Systems,

328
00:22:18,706 --> 00:22:23,177
global leader in telecom, aerospace,
17 billion in profit last year.

329
00:22:23,256 --> 00:22:26,601
We contract for DARPA,
NASA, JPL, you name it.

330
00:22:26,682 --> 00:22:29,435
You perform here,
doors open for you anywhere.

331
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:32,189
First job out of college is critical, kid.

332
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:35,067
You either take a step down
the correct career path

333
00:22:35,167 --> 00:22:38,637
or you fall into a life-sucking abyss.

334
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:43,238
So it all depends on how you respond
to my next two words.

335
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:45,114
Impress me.

336
00:22:46,174 --> 00:22:48,017
- Now?
- Impress me.

337
00:22:48,109 --> 00:22:49,235
You catch me off guard.

338
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,617
- I don't know where to begin.
- Impress me.

339
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,997
I'm an open book.
Ask me any question you like.

340
00:22:52,076 --> 00:22:54,044
- So you're a go-getter, ramrod...
- Yes, sir.

341
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:55,251
Take-charge kind of guy?

342
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:58,048
I'm a killer.
A stone-cold killer.

343
00:22:58,129 --> 00:22:59,255
So, take-charge guy?

344
00:22:59,335 --> 00:23:01,884
Take-charge, Viking, barbarian,
of course, that's me.

345
00:23:01,984 --> 00:23:03,486
Pow! I'm here.

346
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,398
We are not looking for that here.

347
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:16,145
No brown-nosing. No suck up.
No toolery. I...

348
00:23:19,503 --> 00:23:21,050
Yes, Mr Brazos.

349
00:23:21,139 --> 00:23:26,066
Why is Shontel using what
appears to be a red cup

350
00:23:26,152 --> 00:23:27,529
from the red floor

351
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:30,079
- when we are on the yellow floor?
- I'm on it.

352
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:34,855
It is a visual and, therefore,
a visceral betrayal.

353
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:36,628
Stop it!

354
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:38,751
Such a dumb-ass.

355
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:40,886
Disgusting!

356
00:23:41,528 --> 00:23:43,280
Thank you!

357
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,678
It's total anarchy around here.

358
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:51,477
The e-mail I read said administrative aide?

359
00:23:51,722 --> 00:23:53,269
Nope. Mailroom.

360
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:56,269
I'm gonna go.

361
00:23:57,043 --> 00:24:00,923
Do you have any idea how many
Ivy League Phi Beta Kappas

362
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:04,231
- would kill to...
- Mister, I saved your life twice. Okay?

363
00:24:04,314 --> 00:24:06,737
I can't tell you how or when or why,

364
00:24:06,807 --> 00:24:08,128
but I have done shit that matters

365
00:24:08,228 --> 00:24:11,607
and I'd just kind of like a job
where I matter again.

366
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,915
So thank you,
but no, thank you, okay?

367
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:17,210
You know what I think?
You want the job after this job.

368
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:20,384
But, son, this is the job
that's standing in your way.

369
00:24:20,481 --> 00:24:23,781
And that's why you're gonna be
so very, very good at it.

370
00:24:23,881 --> 00:24:26,384
'Cause when I look at you,
I see a younger me.

371
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:50,290
<i>All arriving Autobots, in par,
training and debriefing in 15 minutes.

372
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:55,748
<i>Dino, report to Bay 23.

373
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:59,248
<i>Sideswipe, Bay 37
for weapons assessment.

374
00:25:02,143 --> 00:25:03,736
Senator, I suggest you remember that

375
00:25:03,824 --> 00:25:06,168
when the NSA wants funding, they call me.

376
00:25:06,253 --> 00:25:08,756
When the CIA is gonna take out a target,

377
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,592
they ask first for my permission.

378
00:25:10,672 --> 00:25:11,889
And when the President wants to know

379
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:14,098
which members of Congress
are politically vulnerable

380
00:25:14,176 --> 00:25:18,022
in terms of, let's say,
undiscovered criminal conduct,

381
00:25:18,103 --> 00:25:19,355
I'm the number he dials.

382
00:25:19,436 --> 00:25:21,940
<i>U.S. agencies say they have
been monitoring the blast.

383
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,714
<i>But if in fact, this was a
covert military strike,

384
00:25:24,813 --> 00:25:27,094
<i>- no nation has claimed responsibility.</i>
- CIA is up my ass

385
00:25:27,185 --> 00:25:28,687
about this mystery raid
in the Middle East.

386
00:25:28,774 --> 00:25:32,028
So, it's time to come clean.
Was your unit involved?

387
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:33,239
I'm not sure, ma'am.

388
00:25:33,339 --> 00:25:37,435
All right, guys. This is how you do
a Decepticon head kill shot.

389
00:25:38,687 --> 00:25:40,314
As Director of
National Intelligence,

390
00:25:40,406 --> 00:25:42,283
I'm a really big fan of
intelligent answers.

391
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:45,874
I can't really tell you definitively.
These Autobots are like teenage kids.

392
00:25:45,959 --> 00:25:47,711
They like to sneak out of the
house every once in a while.

393
00:25:47,792 --> 00:25:49,009
Colonel Lennox, are you in command
or are you not?

394
00:25:49,087 --> 00:25:50,430
Yes, ma'am, I am.

395
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:52,474
Stop with the "ma'am."
Enough with the "ma'am."

396
00:25:52,554 --> 00:25:53,931
Do I look like a "ma'am"?

397
00:25:54,031 --> 00:25:56,125
No, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. Yes.

398
00:25:56,705 --> 00:25:58,958
This gun is my perfect invention,
Ironhide.

399
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:00,051
Right.

400
00:26:00,151 --> 00:26:01,869
Good, you're here!

401
00:26:01,961 --> 00:26:03,053
Me name's Que.

402
00:26:03,139 --> 00:26:05,938
I do hope you have answers for him.
I've never seen him so upset.

403
00:26:06,018 --> 00:26:08,362
Optimus, you remember Charlotte Mearing?

404
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:10,615
Our Director of National Intelligence?

405
00:26:10,715 --> 00:26:14,345
He's in a bad mood.
He's not talking to anybody today.

406
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:17,893
What is this,
the silent treatment?

407
00:26:17,983 --> 00:26:20,657
- We've seen that and this is not that.
- Definitely not.

408
00:26:20,739 --> 00:26:22,457
This is worse.

409
00:26:22,557 --> 00:26:25,026
Prime!
Make something of yourself!

410
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:27,343
He's pissed.

411
00:26:33,651 --> 00:26:34,868
You lied to us.

412
00:26:34,958 --> 00:26:39,134
Everything humans know of our planet
we were told had all been shared.

413
00:26:39,234 --> 00:26:41,987
So why was this found
in human possession?

414
00:26:42,166 --> 00:26:44,294
We were in the dark on this also.

415
00:26:44,386 --> 00:26:47,390
It was Director Only clearance
at Sector 7 until now.

416
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:48,582
The bag.

417
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:52,407
- Which bag?
- Hermés. Birkin. Green ostrich!

418
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:54,864
Oh, my God.

419
00:26:56,173 --> 00:27:00,394
This is a secret few men knew,
and fewer still remain alive.

420
00:27:00,485 --> 00:27:01,988
Allow me to please introduce to you

421
00:27:02,071 --> 00:27:04,665
two of NASA's founding
mission directors

422
00:27:04,744 --> 00:27:06,963
and astronaut Dr Buzz Aldrin,

423
00:27:07,043 --> 00:27:09,466
one of the first two men
to step foot on the moon.

424
00:27:09,566 --> 00:27:12,319
Sir? Optimus Prime.

425
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:17,870
From a fellow space traveller,
it's a true honour.

426
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,392
The honor is mine.

427
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:24,402
Our entire space race of the 1960s,
it appears, was in response to an event.

428
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:30,241
Our astronauts investigated
a crashed alien ship.

429
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:31,859
<i>No survivors on board.

430
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:35,120
We were sworn to secrecy
by our Commander in Chief.

431
00:27:35,462 --> 00:27:38,932
This was a mission you
will never speak of.

432
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,112
I understand, sir.

433
00:27:40,194 --> 00:27:44,415
A total of 35 people
knew the real plan at NASA.

434
00:27:44,515 --> 00:27:47,485
Soviets managed to
land unmanned probes.

435
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,836
Somehow they must have
picked up that fuel rod.

436
00:27:51,232 --> 00:27:53,280
We believe the Russians deduced

437
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:55,418
that the rod
was a fissionable fuel assembly,

438
00:27:55,518 --> 00:27:58,613
believed they had it mastered, and
tried to harness it at Chernobyl.

439
00:27:58,902 --> 00:28:00,996
We landed six missions in all.

440
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:03,724
<i>We took hundreds of photos
and samples.

441
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:05,605
We locked them away forever;

442
00:28:05,705 --> 00:28:07,503
And the moon program
was shut down.

443
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:09,856
Well, did you search
the crash vault?

444
00:28:12,712 --> 00:28:15,511
The ship's name was the <i>Ark</i>.

445
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:18,535
I watched it escape Cybertron myself.

446
00:28:18,881 --> 00:28:23,227
It was carrying an Autobot technology
which would have won us the war.

447
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:25,329
And its captain.

448
00:28:26,105 --> 00:28:27,231
Who was its captain?

449
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:31,246
The great Sentinel Prime,
the technology's inventor.

450
00:28:31,332 --> 00:28:35,087
He was commander of the Autobots
before me.

451
00:28:35,187 --> 00:28:36,814
It's imperative that I find it

452
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:39,806
before the Decepticons
learn of its location.

453
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,810
Our Autobot spacecraft
has the ability to get there.

454
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:47,484
And you must pray it's in time.

455
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:03,117
Hi. I'm here to see Carly Spencer.

456
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:08,839
Carly!

457
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:15,904
- You got the job?
- This is Crazy.

458
00:29:15,994 --> 00:29:17,166
- You really got it?
- Yes.

459
00:29:17,266 --> 00:29:19,519
See, what did I tell you?
It's the bunny.

460
00:29:20,408 --> 00:29:21,785
You are so welcome.

461
00:29:21,877 --> 00:29:24,005
- Do you like me more?
- A little bit, yeah.

462
00:29:24,092 --> 00:29:25,218
You said you were his
assistant curator,

463
00:29:25,299 --> 00:29:26,767
you didn't say the guy
owns Space Mountain.

464
00:29:26,849 --> 00:29:31,104
I know. Isn't it beautiful in here?
And he's the coolest guy. Ever.

465
00:29:31,187 --> 00:29:32,313
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

466
00:29:32,413 --> 00:29:33,505
Sam.

467
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:36,776
Dylan Gould.

468
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:40,179
Hey. A pleasure to meet you.

469
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:43,274
Pleasure meeting you. Carly's
told me a lot about you.

470
00:29:43,357 --> 00:29:45,701
Well, vice versa. It's a
beautiful building you got.

471
00:29:45,783 --> 00:29:47,330
It's like the <i>Starship Enterprise</i>
in here.

472
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,957
Thank you very much. It leaks.

473
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,916
Before Carly came to help
run the collection,

474
00:29:50,995 --> 00:29:52,712
it was just a complete mess.

475
00:29:52,793 --> 00:29:55,046
But now,
the restorations are back on track.

476
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,173
We're going to Pebble Beach
this year,

477
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:58,301
and we're gonna get a trophy
for that stand right there.

478
00:29:58,401 --> 00:30:01,245
You know why?
Because this woman right here

479
00:30:01,571 --> 00:30:03,619
- is my secret weapon.
- Okay.

480
00:30:03,708 --> 00:30:07,133
Mr Gould, please, you exaggerate.
All I've done is get you organised.

481
00:30:07,233 --> 00:30:09,782
You've done much more than that,
my Duchess.

482
00:30:10,704 --> 00:30:12,377
Nicknames, that's fun.

483
00:30:12,469 --> 00:30:14,471
Yeah. The Duchess.

484
00:30:14,571 --> 00:30:15,663
She's adorable.

485
00:30:15,767 --> 00:30:18,008
You know, when I stole her away
from the British Embassy,

486
00:30:18,092 --> 00:30:19,693
I said,
"It's easy to manage a country."

487
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:22,154
"Try managing
a priceless collection of art."

488
00:30:22,233 --> 00:30:26,955
Take a look at this
1939 Delahaye 165 Cabriolet.

489
00:30:27,055 --> 00:30:28,147
Designed by a Frenchman.

490
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:32,419
Look at the curves. Elegant, isn't it?
Beautiful.

491
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:35,050
Sensual.

492
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:37,386
Built to evoke the body
of the ideal woman.

493
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:40,088
Come on.

494
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:44,719
My dad had a $10 desk and a dream,
and he built it into an empire.

495
00:30:45,194 --> 00:30:46,411
Wow.

496
00:30:46,503 --> 00:30:48,756
We're the largest
accounting firm in the U.S.

497
00:30:48,843 --> 00:30:52,848
I started up the venture side after he passed.
Invest in the future.

498
00:30:52,933 --> 00:30:55,185
Try and bet on the winners.

499
00:30:55,285 --> 00:30:58,038
See, collecting cars
helps me keep my sanity.

500
00:31:04,738 --> 00:31:06,490
You guys look great.

501
00:31:09,517 --> 00:31:10,894
That was a great day, Mr Gould.

502
00:31:10,984 --> 00:31:13,032
- I haven't seen that one.
- No. Me, neither.

503
00:31:13,132 --> 00:31:14,759
Jeans are tight.

504
00:31:15,727 --> 00:31:19,152
Here we go. Here we go.
You see that?

505
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:20,746
Judgment.
Judging a man by his car?

506
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:22,423
And you're gonna wave at him
while he's judging me?

507
00:31:22,502 --> 00:31:25,722
What's with you? He's my boss.
This job pays for our food, our rent.

508
00:31:25,797 --> 00:31:28,438
No, I totally understand. I'm totally fine.
I get it. I'm well fed.

509
00:31:28,513 --> 00:31:30,231
And guess what?
I'm not your boy toy any more.

510
00:31:30,306 --> 00:31:32,024
I got my big boy pants on.
You see them?

511
00:31:32,088 --> 00:31:33,328
In the car. Thank you, Duchess.

512
00:31:33,428 --> 00:31:36,147
Oh, my God.
Are you threatened by him?

513
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:43,593
Threatened? What am I threatened by?
His money? His power? His good looks?

514
00:31:43,685 --> 00:31:45,062
None of the above. Check!

515
00:31:45,147 --> 00:31:47,195
God!
Your temper tantrums are so sexy.

516
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,407
Get in the car, please.

517
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:52,494
Sam, he's hardly the first
man to ever smile at me.

518
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,873
- I think I can handle it.
- Hold on, hold on.

519
00:31:53,954 --> 00:31:57,209
It's the smiling back part that gets me.
Okay?

520
00:31:57,309 --> 00:31:59,027
No more smiles. Never again.
I promise.

521
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:00,840
That works for me.

522
00:32:07,908 --> 00:32:10,912
Easy! Easy!
You're not gonna get it started that way.

523
00:32:11,002 --> 00:32:14,051
Well, I was just getting it ready.
I'm about 32% done with my restoration.

524
00:32:14,151 --> 00:32:16,312
Some chrome work, put a spoiler on the back.
Done deal.

525
00:32:16,487 --> 00:32:19,087
You know, Carly's been telling me
you've been struggling job-wise.

526
00:32:19,175 --> 00:32:20,267
Just so you know,

527
00:32:20,367 --> 00:32:23,712
I'm on the board for Accuretta Systems,
and I put in a call for you.

528
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:26,869
Let's keep it between us, okay?
She's so proud of you.

529
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:29,331
You're a lucky man.

530
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:35,663
<i>Xanthium approaching Tranquility Base.

531
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:38,465
<i>You're a go for landing.

532
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,178
Ratchet, let's roll.

533
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:06,697
We're entering the <i>Ark</i>.

534
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:31,014
His levels are faint.

535
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:37,775
He locked himself away
to guard the pillars.

536
00:33:38,225 --> 00:33:39,647
Sentinel.

537
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:43,272
You're coming home, old friend.

538
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:27,529
All hail Megatron.

539
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:37,577
My master! Yes, my master! Yes!

540
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:46,836
Don't be greedy, my fragile ones.

541
00:34:50,147 --> 00:34:52,115
My poor master.

542
00:34:52,207 --> 00:34:56,212
How it pains me to see you
so wounded, so weak.

543
00:34:56,297 --> 00:34:59,597
Spare me, you gaseous sycophant!

544
00:34:59,697 --> 00:35:02,667
You know what you are told,
which is nothing.

545
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:13,094
Soundwave reporting, Lord Megatron.

546
00:35:13,184 --> 00:35:17,109
And what news
from your little assassin?

547
00:35:17,191 --> 00:35:19,410
Autobots have taken the bait!

548
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:23,105
They've discovered the <i>Ark</i>
and returned with its cargo.

549
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:28,043
You did me great honour
tracking that ship to the moon.

550
00:35:29,002 --> 00:35:33,599
Your human collaborators
have served their purpose, Soundwave.

551
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:37,849
It's time to eliminate loose ends.

552
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:42,023
<i>Laserbeak, kill them all.

553
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:43,646
<i>With pleasure.

554
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:58,324
Is your daddy home?

555
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:01,372
- "Then Madeline said..."
- Madeline!

556
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:04,125
Hello, Mom.

557
00:36:08,896 --> 00:36:10,193
Get out of the house!

558
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:13,137
- What are you doing in my house?
- Just visiting.

559
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:32,885
What is this hoochie-mama outfit?

560
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:37,679
No, this is the aerospace division!
We do not allow that here!

561
00:36:37,766 --> 00:36:39,861
New guy! You see that?
That's a Latin meltdown, okay?

562
00:36:39,946 --> 00:36:42,324
You ever show up in my office
with a hoochie-mama outfit, you're fired.

563
00:36:42,406 --> 00:36:43,453
You got that?

564
00:36:43,533 --> 00:36:45,707
Okay, you're gonna be on this cart
for two-and-a-half years, okay?

565
00:36:45,806 --> 00:36:47,526
I want you to live it, love it
and name it.

566
00:36:47,588 --> 00:36:50,188
There's no ladder climbing in my office.
I run a tight ship. Okay?

567
00:36:50,288 --> 00:36:51,631
- Yes, sir.
- Move!

568
00:37:10,499 --> 00:37:13,548
I found that paper
I was telling you about.

569
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,366
- What are we looking at?
- Shut up!

570
00:37:19,112 --> 00:37:20,992
You do that to me again,
and I'll kick your ass!

571
00:37:23,466 --> 00:37:24,934
Hi.

572
00:37:25,026 --> 00:37:26,152
Hi, angel.

573
00:37:26,252 --> 00:37:27,629
- How are you?
- Good.

574
00:37:27,937 --> 00:37:30,565
I had a meeting downtown.
Was it okay for me to stop by?

575
00:37:30,654 --> 00:37:32,703
I don't know.
My 500-page employee conduct manual

576
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:33,916
isn't exactly a page turner.

577
00:37:33,999 --> 00:37:35,046
This is great.

578
00:37:35,125 --> 00:37:37,844
Yeah, Autobots are off saving the world,
and I have organised four binders.

579
00:37:37,944 --> 00:37:39,366
I'm living the dream. Come on.

580
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,806
Visitor violation.

581
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:48,142
- You okay?
- Absolutely.

582
00:37:51,853 --> 00:37:53,150
I'm next.

583
00:37:54,998 --> 00:37:58,343
Listen. Saturday.
Dylan's throwing a party at his house.

584
00:37:58,431 --> 00:38:00,024
It's a work thing,
but he's invited you, too.

585
00:38:00,109 --> 00:38:01,111
Did he?

586
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:02,572
I want you to come
and laugh at my bad jokes.

587
00:38:02,626 --> 00:38:04,187
It would really mean a lot to me,
okay?

588
00:38:04,287 --> 00:38:06,085
I'd love to go. How'd
you get over here?

589
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:08,958
- Car.
- You don't have a car.

590
00:38:09,349 --> 00:38:12,148
- Yes, I do.
- What, did you win it in a raffle?

591
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,617
He gave me one.

592
00:38:13,701 --> 00:38:14,793
He gave you a car?

593
00:38:14,872 --> 00:38:16,465
Yeah, I think it was a work perk.

594
00:38:16,547 --> 00:38:17,673
A work perk.

595
00:38:17,773 --> 00:38:22,324
- What kind of car did he give you?
- A Mercedes SLS AMG.

596
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:24,644
Really throaty engine.

597
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,772
<i>Mercedes-Benz SLS

598
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:30,358
<i>- combines breathtaking performance...</i>
- You drove this here?

599
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:32,944
That's a $200,000 car.

600
00:38:33,916 --> 00:38:34,963
I know.

601
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:37,463
You know how long it would take
me to afford a car like this?

602
00:38:37,795 --> 00:38:39,968
- A long time?
- Yeah, like 53 years.

603
00:38:40,058 --> 00:38:41,354
He said it was for both of us.

604
00:38:41,454 --> 00:38:43,854
Then what we should do is, we
should sell it and buy a house.

605
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:47,408
You're frustrated, I know.

606
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:48,727
I've been there.

607
00:38:48,816 --> 00:38:52,366
It's called paying your dues.
Good things will happen.

608
00:38:52,451 --> 00:38:53,748
Ladies and gentlemen,

609
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:56,334
I need some lunch time filing done, stat.

610
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:59,546
Who would like to score
some Bruce Brazos points?

611
00:38:59,646 --> 00:39:01,694
Bruce, you found your guy.

612
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,763
Witwicky!

613
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:07,599
The man who makes
this company run.

614
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:09,873
Now, who have we here?

615
00:39:09,961 --> 00:39:12,805
Is it a sister, Facebook friend,
Twitter tweeter?

616
00:39:12,886 --> 00:39:15,105
- Carly, this is Bruce. Bruce.
- Hi.

617
00:39:15,183 --> 00:39:17,527
I'm his girlfriend. A pleasure to meet you.
Sam was right.

618
00:39:17,604 --> 00:39:19,322
You really do have a
smashing head of hair.

619
00:39:19,422 --> 00:39:20,799
Well, thank you.

620
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,365
- Sam, I got to run.
- Yeah.

621
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:26,243
Here, your present.

622
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:28,704
Your favorite colour.

623
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:32,295
- Nice to meet you, Mr Brazos.
- And you.

624
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,215
See you, boys.

625
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:44,365
I'm still stewing about
that binder incident, Jerry.

626
00:39:44,457 --> 00:39:47,586
May I finish my Shuhua milk,
Donny?

627
00:39:47,686 --> 00:39:50,940
I don't care about your exotic milk.
I care about respect!

628
00:40:10,433 --> 00:40:11,810
I know who you are!

629
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,503
Witwicky! Witwicky!

630
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:17,044
- I'm talking to you!
- Excuse me. Thank you.

631
00:40:18,766 --> 00:40:20,109
Slow down, tiger.

632
00:40:20,197 --> 00:40:22,040
You showed up in the background
of six different photos,

633
00:40:22,126 --> 00:40:23,753
two continents, with aliens.

634
00:40:23,853 --> 00:40:28,233
That was you in Egypt, right?
Because you know the aliens.

635
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:29,893
See you!

636
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:33,189
Give me my jacket!

637
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:44,193
I'm Wang. Deep Wang. Deep Wang.

638
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:45,759
You're not getting it.
Deep Throat.

639
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:48,037
Watergate?
I'm talking code to you...

640
00:40:48,488 --> 00:40:49,614
Damn it.

641
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,492
They watch and listen.

642
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:56,379
I can't go to the government,
but you can!

643
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,774
Because shit's going down, son!
It is Code Pink, as in Floyd!

644
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:02,548
Dark Side! Why do you think no
one's been up there since 1972?

645
00:41:02,852 --> 00:41:06,072
I know you're speaking English,
it's just a very strange English.

646
00:41:06,162 --> 00:41:08,335
That's why I'm not...

647
00:41:08,435 --> 00:41:10,108
Don't. I'm gonna hit you.

648
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:11,853
I'm gonna hit you right back, son.

649
00:41:12,345 --> 00:41:13,813
It's my manifesto.

650
00:41:14,076 --> 00:41:15,123
They're whacking us out,

651
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:16,816
everyone who knows
what's on the dark...

652
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:20,979
Your alien friends are in danger,
you know, the good ones. It's up to you.

653
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:23,026
Calm down.

654
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,737
Easy, Sam!

655
00:41:34,885 --> 00:41:36,853
What are you looking at?

656
00:41:36,943 --> 00:41:38,365
Yo, dawg.

657
00:41:38,465 --> 00:41:41,765
Are you up in my shit?
Who are you working for?

658
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:45,341
Staredown, you and me.

659
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:48,423
Guess I won.

660
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:53,011
Moon satellites.

661
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,264
The Russian space program.

662
00:41:57,265 --> 00:41:58,482
Experts dead.

663
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,275
Space program ends.

664
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:03,154
Dark side...
Dark side of the moon.

665
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:06,090
Look what I found outside the bathroom.
Is it yours?

666
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,238
- Deal with this.
- Yes, sir.

667
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:12,576
I did everything you want!

668
00:42:12,676 --> 00:42:14,349
I really think we should talk,
'cause some of the stuff...

669
00:42:14,441 --> 00:42:16,193
Whoa! Knock first!

670
00:42:16,293 --> 00:42:17,590
Can't you see I'm busy?

671
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:19,670
Who are you? Who are you?

672
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,082
You straddled me in the stall.

673
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:25,047
That's happened to me once in this life.
I wouldn't forget it.

674
00:42:25,818 --> 00:42:27,820
From the bathroom stall.
You took your package out.

675
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,299
- You took your package out.
- Whoa! We are not boyfriends, okay?

676
00:42:31,403 --> 00:42:33,701
One phone call from me
and I'll have you fired.

677
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:35,644
Yes, I will, Gaylord!

678
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:37,229
Are you okay?

679
00:42:38,372 --> 00:42:40,124
Hemorrhoids!

680
00:42:40,216 --> 00:42:41,968
Should I come back?
When should I come back?

681
00:42:42,068 --> 00:42:43,820
Come back when you
learn some manners!

682
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:50,568
I don't know him!
I would never say anything!

683
00:42:54,214 --> 00:42:56,057
Okay, okay!
I sabotaged the mapping satellite,

684
00:42:56,147 --> 00:42:57,194
just like I promised,

685
00:42:57,277 --> 00:42:58,995
I can put a blind spot
in the program as a bonus.

686
00:42:59,075 --> 00:43:00,873
What more do you want from me?

687
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:04,753
Jerry, you are my favourite.

688
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:06,424
I'll do whatever you want me to do.

689
00:43:06,524 --> 00:43:10,495
I know,
but my superiors need me to...

690
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,759
- Please, you don't have to...
- ...suicide you.

691
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:18,354
What did you say to Witwicky?

692
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,057
Shit!

693
00:43:22,951 --> 00:43:24,919
Who wants some chicken dinner now,
bitch?

694
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:28,193
'Cause somebody messed
with the wrong Wang today!

695
00:43:29,649 --> 00:43:31,743
Come on! You want some of me?

696
00:43:43,266 --> 00:43:46,691
I don't need any more
didactic lectures from Chuck.

697
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:47,883
Jesus!

698
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:54,886
Get legal.

699
00:43:56,651 --> 00:43:57,994
That's Jerry!

700
00:43:58,084 --> 00:44:00,382
Come on, people.
Yes, a workmate died,

701
00:44:00,466 --> 00:44:02,639
but looking out the window
is not going to bring him back.

702
00:44:02,721 --> 00:44:03,893
The man was depressed.

703
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:05,021
Don't take a picture!

704
00:44:05,102 --> 00:44:07,355
You can keep watching him,
but he's not getting up.

705
00:44:07,455 --> 00:44:09,958
You all read "Humpty Dumpty".
Okay?

706
00:44:10,707 --> 00:44:12,300
Witwicky.

707
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,243
I'm spearheading the press.
You clean up.

708
00:44:14,669 --> 00:44:18,139
Wang is everywhere.
He is in the bistro.

709
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:20,583
He's in the bamboo.
He's on the balustrade.

710
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:23,582
You see the sidewalk down there?
Man!

711
00:44:24,015 --> 00:44:26,689
Box up his personals.
Get his name off his parking space.

712
00:44:26,777 --> 00:44:28,495
Hey, when did we
get a new copier?

713
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:30,708
Listen, I'm not gonna say anything
about what I saw.

714
00:44:30,792 --> 00:44:34,672
Who you share a toilet stall with
is totally your business.

715
00:44:34,772 --> 00:44:37,525
This is exceedingly Japanese.

716
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:42,225
They never make it easy,
do they?

717
00:45:19,867 --> 00:45:22,120
- What is with you?
- This is the real deal, Carly, okay?

718
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:25,565
I need you to stay composed.
It's real life. I'll explain it to you later.

719
00:45:28,689 --> 00:45:31,129
We've got an emergency.
You gotta get Colonel Lennox out here.

720
00:45:31,216 --> 00:45:32,810
I'm reporting a Decepticon.
The Decepticons are back.

721
00:45:32,891 --> 00:45:33,984
You gotta open that gate right now.

722
00:45:34,066 --> 00:45:36,569
Easy, sir.
This is Health and Human Services.

723
00:45:36,652 --> 00:45:38,154
Right. Packing M4s?

724
00:45:38,236 --> 00:45:39,613
What are you protecting,
colostomy bags?

725
00:45:39,713 --> 00:45:41,153
- Bedpans? Throat lozenges?
- Babe...

726
00:45:41,305 --> 00:45:42,557
Where'd you get that hat from,
nursing school?

727
00:45:42,645 --> 00:45:44,362
So, you're nurses and foot-powder protectors?
Fantastic.

728
00:45:44,444 --> 00:45:45,536
- Babe.
- Yes.

729
00:45:45,615 --> 00:45:46,707
I don't think we're in the right place.

730
00:45:46,769 --> 00:45:47,809
We are in the right place.

731
00:45:47,879 --> 00:45:49,927
We're in the right place
and I'm gonna talk to Optimus right now.

732
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:50,967
- You're gonna get Optimus out here.
- Sir.

733
00:45:51,045 --> 00:45:52,046
Sir, you got the wrong building.

734
00:45:52,127 --> 00:45:53,128
I don't know what you're talking about.

735
00:45:53,206 --> 00:45:54,924
What part of "Decepticons are back"
do you not understand?

736
00:45:55,001 --> 00:45:57,595
Yo! You being a smartass?

737
00:45:57,695 --> 00:46:00,699
Do not hit my car!
It's a collector's item!

738
00:46:00,901 --> 00:46:01,993
I wouldn't do that.

739
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:03,345
You're crazy!

740
00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:06,956
We got an Energon reading!

741
00:46:07,046 --> 00:46:08,593
We've got aliens in the vehicle!

742
00:46:08,678 --> 00:46:11,851
You move, you're dead!
Out! Out!

743
00:46:11,951 --> 00:46:13,828
Got aliens in the vehicle!

744
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:17,258
- Freeze! Get out!
- We're freezing!

745
00:46:17,346 --> 00:46:20,357
Are you... Are you kidding me?

746
00:46:20,457 --> 00:46:22,050
Sam, they've got guns!

747
00:46:24,115 --> 00:46:27,210
- I got him. Go!
- Bee! Is Bee in there?

748
00:46:28,310 --> 00:46:29,937
Okay, all right!

749
00:46:30,027 --> 00:46:32,576
This how you treat Autobots?
We're on the same team.

750
00:46:32,658 --> 00:46:35,252
Yeah, enjoy your next job at 7-Eleven,
dickhead.

751
00:46:35,331 --> 00:46:37,174
- That's right.
- A-hole.

752
00:46:37,274 --> 00:46:39,026
How's your car now?

753
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:49,436
That's my car.

754
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:51,918
Come here.

755
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:53,011
Come here!

756
00:46:53,098 --> 00:46:55,100
Come on. Sam.

757
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,417
What is your deal?

758
00:46:56,922 --> 00:46:58,174
I know your black ops stuff
is important to you.

759
00:46:58,233 --> 00:47:00,593
I'm not trying to diminish it
or guilt-trip you or anything,

760
00:47:00,663 --> 00:47:02,165
I just never see you any more.

761
00:47:02,238 --> 00:47:04,582
You can't come to the garage
and just hang out one night?

762
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:06,788
Sam. That makes me feel bad.

763
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:08,441
I hope you feel bad.
You should feel bad.

764
00:47:08,505 --> 00:47:11,223
Look at the jalopy I'm driving now.
I feel bad every single day.

765
00:47:11,293 --> 00:47:13,637
Yo, let's go, both of you.
Lennox wants to see you.

766
00:47:13,713 --> 00:47:15,090
What, we not good enough
for you any more?

767
00:47:15,169 --> 00:47:18,548
I'm sorry, babe.
They were very rude, all right?

768
00:47:18,648 --> 00:47:21,618
And you're fixing my car.
You don't think so?

769
00:47:21,747 --> 00:47:23,908
Raise your hand if you had a
flying psycho-ninja copier

770
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,001
trying to kill you today!

771
00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:26,200
Those are my brass knuckles.

772
00:47:26,251 --> 00:47:28,211
That's my anklet.
Do I have to take that off, too?

773
00:47:28,311 --> 00:47:29,358
And my toe rings?

774
00:47:29,576 --> 00:47:31,249
<i>All NEST officials clear the floor.

775
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:33,443
<i>We have 10 minutes
until attempted contact.

776
00:47:33,918 --> 00:47:35,795
We've taken possession
of the five devices

777
00:47:35,882 --> 00:47:38,601
that were hidden in the ship
with Sentinel Prime.

778
00:47:38,701 --> 00:47:41,375
They're some kind of prototype
Autobot technology.

779
00:47:41,875 --> 00:47:44,845
They say Sentinel
was the Einstein of his civilization,

780
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:46,345
so we're gonna keep these locked up

781
00:47:46,436 --> 00:47:48,109
until we know what
we're dealing with.

782
00:47:48,209 --> 00:47:51,509
Right now, no one gets access.
No one.

783
00:47:51,936 --> 00:47:54,689
This Wang guy recognized me.
He told me to warn you.

784
00:47:54,777 --> 00:47:55,994
He was talking about the
dark side of the moon,

785
00:47:56,078 --> 00:47:57,125
- then they killed him.
- Wait a minute.

786
00:47:57,206 --> 00:47:59,254
- He mentioned the moon?
- Yeah, dark side of the moon.

787
00:47:59,332 --> 00:48:01,926
But why would Decepticons
want to kill humans?

788
00:48:02,005 --> 00:48:04,053
I thought their war was
with the Autobots.

789
00:48:04,132 --> 00:48:06,305
And that is when he made his first
quick-look science report.

790
00:48:06,384 --> 00:48:08,056
That's what we want...

791
00:48:08,136 --> 00:48:09,308
Who's the chick? Okay.

792
00:48:09,385 --> 00:48:11,353
Excuse me! Colonel Lennox?

793
00:48:11,431 --> 00:48:13,855
Director Mearing,
this is Sam Witwicky...

794
00:48:13,935 --> 00:48:17,064
I know his name, Colonel.
I wanna know who gave him clearance?

795
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:18,691
Who gave me clearance?
How about Optimus Prime,

796
00:48:18,791 --> 00:48:20,509
when he touched down in suburbia
looking for my house?

797
00:48:20,755 --> 00:48:22,883
This is the National Intelligence Director.

798
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:24,200
In case you...

799
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:27,263
- Hi.
- Disrespecting a federal officer?

800
00:48:27,350 --> 00:48:28,819
Maybe that'll get you somewhere.
Who's she?

801
00:48:28,919 --> 00:48:30,136
She's my girlfriend.

802
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:31,788
What is this, like, a date?

803
00:48:32,118 --> 00:48:34,478
She knows all about the Autobots, okay?
She knows Bumblebee.

804
00:48:34,566 --> 00:48:37,035
And she comes from a military family.
I can vouch for her.

805
00:48:37,118 --> 00:48:39,792
Hey, I have an idea.
How about we get back to the important topics,

806
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:42,253
like the fact that I almost had my face cut off
by a Decepticon?

807
00:48:42,329 --> 00:48:44,929
As a taxpayer, I'd like to lodge a complaint,
as a matter of fact.

808
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:46,097
Okay, listen, all right?

809
00:48:46,175 --> 00:48:48,223
One of the software engineers
at Sam's office was murdered today.

810
00:48:48,323 --> 00:48:50,124
He was involved in NASA's
lunar mapping probe.

811
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:52,346
Here's the thing, Colonel Lennox.

812
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:55,474
We cannot entrust national security
to teenagers

813
00:48:55,850 --> 00:49:00,196
unless I missed a policy paper.
Are we doing that now? No. Good.

814
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:01,947
I don't care who you are.

815
00:49:02,126 --> 00:49:05,801
If you breathe a word of what you see
in here, you will do time for treason.

816
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:06,948
Do you understand me?

817
00:49:07,403 --> 00:49:10,407
I'll take my orders from the Autobots.
I know them. I don't know you.

818
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:12,579
You will.

819
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:16,045
Sentinel Prime.

820
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:19,544
These things run on Energon,
and he's out of it. He's in a

821
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,042
sort of a sleep mode.

822
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:22,926
Let us begin.

823
00:49:31,427 --> 00:49:33,600
That's the great Matrix of Leadership.

824
00:49:34,889 --> 00:49:38,735
He holds the only thing in the universe
that can repower a Transformer's spark.

825
00:49:39,727 --> 00:49:41,400
This is incredible.

826
00:49:42,188 --> 00:49:43,735
Sentinel Prime,

827
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:47,235
we bid you return.

828
00:49:57,061 --> 00:49:58,187
Hold your fire!

829
00:49:58,287 --> 00:50:00,005
Stop! Sentinel!

830
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,963
It is I, Optimus Prime!

831
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:06,921
It is all right. You are safe.

832
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:10,090
There is nothing to fear.

833
00:50:11,217 --> 00:50:13,219
We are here.

834
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:16,559
You are home, Sentinel.

835
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:23,566
The war... The war!

836
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:25,947
The war was lost.

837
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:29,410
Cybertron is now but
a barren wasteland.

838
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:32,659
We have taken refuge here,
on planet Earth.

839
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:35,286
Its human race is our ally.

840
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:38,352
My ship. We came under fire.

841
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:41,706
The pillars.
Where are the pillars?

842
00:50:42,355 --> 00:50:45,985
You saved five of them,
including the control pillar.

843
00:50:46,085 --> 00:50:47,382
Only five?

844
00:50:48,271 --> 00:50:49,864
We once had hundreds!

845
00:50:49,952 --> 00:50:51,169
Excuse me, gentlemen.

846
00:50:51,252 --> 00:50:54,051
May I ask, what is this technology
you're looking for?

847
00:50:54,131 --> 00:50:56,975
It is the ability to
reshape the universe.

848
00:50:57,075 --> 00:50:59,703
Together the pillars
form a space bridge.

849
00:50:59,952 --> 00:51:03,502
I designed, and I alone,
can control it.

850
00:51:03,590 --> 00:51:05,558
It defies your laws of physics

851
00:51:05,644 --> 00:51:08,272
to transport matter
through time and space.

852
00:51:08,356 --> 00:51:11,360
You're talking about a teleportation device,
aren't you?

853
00:51:11,441 --> 00:51:14,240
Yes, for resources, for refugees.

854
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:18,245
Refugees, or troops of soldiers,
weapons, maybe bombs!

855
00:51:18,323 --> 00:51:21,167
A means of an instant strike!
That's its military function, isn't it?

856
00:51:21,245 --> 00:51:25,421
It is our technology
and it must be returned.

857
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:27,923
Yes. If humans say so.

858
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,971
You can't just bring weapons of mass destruction
into our atmosphere!

859
00:51:32,049 --> 00:51:33,471
You kind of have to clear customs first!

860
00:51:33,571 --> 00:51:37,041
A little formality called paperwork
kind of separates us from the animals.

861
00:51:37,236 --> 00:51:40,581
I will overlook your condescending tone

862
00:51:40,672 --> 00:51:43,301
if you heed the gravity of mine.

863
00:51:43,401 --> 00:51:46,701
The Decepticons must never know
the space bridge is here.

864
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:47,938
For in their hands,

865
00:51:48,397 --> 00:51:52,118
it would mean the end of your world.

866
00:51:53,402 --> 00:51:54,699
"Total Nightmare" file.

867
00:51:55,675 --> 00:51:58,599
So, the investigation is open.
We've sent agents to your office.

868
00:51:58,699 --> 00:52:01,659
And, for the time being, we're gonna
send you home with Autobot protection.

869
00:52:02,185 --> 00:52:03,562
Who do I need to speak to

870
00:52:03,649 --> 00:52:06,620
to get you guys to understand that I can help,
that I can contribute?

871
00:52:06,705 --> 00:52:07,957
Hey, we can all help.
Want to tell you what I know?

872
00:52:08,038 --> 00:52:10,712
I could tell you about the solar system,
all the fun planets to hang out in.

873
00:52:10,795 --> 00:52:11,796
Get off my desk, please.

874
00:52:11,875 --> 00:52:14,594
You pulling out guns?
I can't help you out now. She angry.

875
00:52:14,674 --> 00:52:15,766
Oh, my God.

876
00:52:15,819 --> 00:52:17,499
What do you envision for me?
I go home now?

877
00:52:17,567 --> 00:52:19,569
I go back to work? I make copies?
I mean...

878
00:52:19,644 --> 00:52:21,897
This is a unit for veteran intelligence officers

879
00:52:21,976 --> 00:52:23,478
and Special Forces,

880
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:25,730
not for boys who once owned
special cars.

881
00:52:25,828 --> 00:52:27,421
That's a bit harsh, isn't it, ma'am?

882
00:52:27,511 --> 00:52:29,014
Don't call me ma'am.
I'm not a ma'am.

883
00:52:29,114 --> 00:52:30,616
Well, you're a woman, aren't you?

884
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:33,946
So, are those yours?

885
00:52:34,502 --> 00:52:35,970
Yeah. CIA.

886
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:39,119
I only ask 'cause I also have a medal,
from the President.

887
00:52:39,597 --> 00:52:42,476
Yeah. Great.
So, it's not that complicated, right?

888
00:52:42,564 --> 00:52:45,158
No one gets to work with the Autobots
unless I approve it.

889
00:52:45,258 --> 00:52:46,698
You're breaking my chain of command.

890
00:52:48,978 --> 00:52:51,652
Come on, let's go.
You've done what you came for.

891
00:52:51,742 --> 00:52:54,666
With all due respect, young man,
I appreciate what you did.

892
00:52:54,750 --> 00:52:55,922
But you're not a soldier.

893
00:52:56,022 --> 00:52:58,022
You're a messenger.
You've always been a messenger.

894
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:00,636
He's a hero.

895
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:09,194
Bee, you take the freight elevator.
I'll see you up there.

896
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:16,594
This blows.
That lady officially kicked us out.

897
00:53:16,686 --> 00:53:19,439
Yeah.
Witness Protection Program sucks.

898
00:53:19,522 --> 00:53:22,617
Yeah, but we're a whole lot safer
with big yellow and his cannons.

899
00:53:22,717 --> 00:53:24,560
That dog can't protect crap.

900
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,167
Bee?

901
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,803
You miss hanging out?

902
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:37,138
Yeah, me, too.

903
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,662
That woman,
she called me a messenger.

904
00:53:43,754 --> 00:53:46,381
Can you believe that?
After everything I've done, I'm a messenger.

905
00:53:46,469 --> 00:53:49,222
I believe it.
I tell you, Sammy, we feel the same way.

906
00:53:49,322 --> 00:53:51,040
The disrespect on this rock is criminal.

907
00:53:52,371 --> 00:53:55,215
We should do something about it.

908
00:53:55,305 --> 00:53:59,481
Bee, I need to know why
they're killing humans.

909
00:53:59,567 --> 00:54:01,569
I say we call in the expert.

910
00:54:01,652 --> 00:54:04,451
<i>My next guest is a former
American intelligence operative

911
00:54:04,534 --> 00:54:06,411
<i>who has dared to speak out

912
00:54:06,490 --> 00:54:10,211

913

00:55:08,726 --> 00:55:09,978
<i>You want a piece of me, Bill?

938
00:55:10,059 --> 00:55:11,436
<i>- You want to get naked? I'm ready!</i>
- Wow.

939
00:55:11,518 --> 00:55:14,397
{\an8}<i>- Interview is over! You, out of my house.
- You're sounding like a pinhead, agent.

940
00:55:14,479 --> 00:55:16,231
{\an8}<i>- And I've got a suggestion for you.
- It's oven Understand?

941
00:55:16,310 --> 00:55:17,527
{\an8}<i>- Damage control.</i>
- Dutch!

942
00:55:17,606 --> 00:55:19,529
You have obviously upset Mr Simmons!

943
00:55:19,606 --> 00:55:21,825
You have 23 seconds
to leave the property.

944
00:55:21,903 --> 00:55:23,325
I have called the police!

945
00:55:23,406 --> 00:55:25,909
{\an8}You are peasant people
throwing rocks at a giant!

946
00:55:25,977 --> 00:55:27,298
What's up next?
What have we got?

947
00:55:27,372 --> 00:55:28,669
Book signing, Midtown, noon.

948
00:55:28,753 --> 00:55:30,994
Then we pitch your reality show
to the Discovery Channel.

949
00:55:31,076 --> 00:55:34,125
And I have this.... Witwicky
who keeps calling me.

950
00:55:34,205 --> 00:55:35,252
Five times today.

951
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:36,504
Kid? What does he want?

952
00:55:36,581 --> 00:55:38,049
I called you because
the Decepticons are back.

953
00:55:38,129 --> 00:55:39,506
I want to know why,
and I need your help.

954
00:55:39,587 --> 00:55:41,841
They're back?

955
00:55:41,921 --> 00:55:43,343
Well, that's good for business.

956
00:55:43,422 --> 00:55:45,346
What if I told you I know a
50-year-old alien secret

957
00:55:45,446 --> 00:55:46,663
that nobody ever told you.

958
00:55:47,094 --> 00:55:52,100
Do not tempt my addiction.
I have gone through withdrawal, kid.

959
00:55:52,224 --> 00:55:54,977
- Dutch, is this line secure?
- No.

960
00:55:57,458 --> 00:56:00,507
Don't take the risk.
I'm rich, why should I?

961
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:02,985
Do not relapse. I won't.

962
00:56:03,510 --> 00:56:06,013
Do not let the demons win.

963
00:56:06,113 --> 00:56:07,239
Got it.

964
00:56:08,574 --> 00:56:10,872
What kind of secret?

965
00:56:11,385 --> 00:56:14,104
Apollo. Moon. Aliens. Cover-up.

966
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:16,332
Future tech. Assassinations.
That kind of stuff.

967
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:18,542
Apollo.

968
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:20,965
Dutch!

969
00:56:27,676 --> 00:56:30,676
Tell Megatron... "Let's tango."

970
00:56:41,732 --> 00:56:44,861
So majestic and peaceful, this planet.

971
00:56:45,381 --> 00:56:48,555
Unlike the final days of Cybertron.

972
00:56:48,643 --> 00:56:51,362
I've wondered what might have been

973
00:56:51,462 --> 00:56:55,342
if you had fought the final battle,
instead of me.

974
00:56:55,930 --> 00:56:58,524
Never mourn the past,
young warrior.

975
00:56:58,624 --> 00:57:02,629
Thanks to you, our race survives.

976
00:57:04,525 --> 00:57:07,074
You were our leader, Sentinel.

977
00:57:07,162 --> 00:57:10,006
It is your right to lead us again.

978
00:57:10,090 --> 00:57:12,388
In a world I do not know,

979
00:57:12,488 --> 00:57:17,460
I am no longer your teacher, Optimus.
You are mine.

980
00:57:21,313 --> 00:57:23,657
You've got to break this case down.

981
00:57:23,755 --> 00:57:25,678
What we have here
is an astronaut epidemic.

982
00:57:25,765 --> 00:57:29,235
MIA. Dead. Died in a car accident.
Killed. DOA. Car death.

983
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:30,446
It's like these guys can't drive.

984
00:57:30,546 --> 00:57:32,827
They can fly into outer space,
but they can't drive a car.

985
00:57:33,325 --> 00:57:36,579
- Procured your information, Witwicky.
- Thank you, Bruce.

986
00:57:37,537 --> 00:57:38,880
Now,

987
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:42,717
let me see one right now.
One time.

988
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:44,336
- Quick.
- Very.

989
00:57:50,384 --> 00:57:52,011
Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter.

990
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:54,642
It says NASA launched it in 2009.

991
00:57:55,130 --> 00:57:57,291
See, forensics show Wang may
have messed with the code,

992
00:57:57,379 --> 00:57:58,972
preventing it from mapping
the far side of the moon,

993
00:57:59,057 --> 00:58:00,309
which is also the dark side.

994
00:58:00,391 --> 00:58:01,813
Fucking awesome.

995
00:58:01,892 --> 00:58:05,487
They infiltrate us, intimidate us,
coerce us to do their dirty work.

996
00:58:05,587 --> 00:58:07,464
And once they're done,

997
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:10,282
a double-tap to the cerebellum.

998
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:12,580
So humans are working
for the Decepticons.

999
00:58:13,177 --> 00:58:15,225
I don't think this is
about the Decepticons

1000
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:17,748
looking for something
on the moon.

1001
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:22,048
I think it's about something
they wanted to hide.

1002
00:58:22,666 --> 00:58:24,168
Come to Daddy.

1003
00:58:25,293 --> 00:58:26,385
Come on, throw down.

1004
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:30,460
Did you eat a lot of paint
chips when you were a kid?

1005
00:58:31,008 --> 00:58:32,055
He's a freak.

1006
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:34,394
- Like it?
- Get back!

1007
00:58:37,556 --> 00:58:38,773
I'm ticklish!

1008
00:58:40,037 --> 00:58:44,338
Sir! We are having a pretty high-level
alien intel confab here

1009
00:58:44,429 --> 00:58:47,683
that I don't think you're cleared for,
errand boy.

1010
00:58:47,768 --> 00:58:48,815
Yeah, you're right.

1011
00:58:48,898 --> 00:58:51,321
- It's a bitching robot.
- I think it's time to go, Bruce.

1012
00:58:51,421 --> 00:58:53,970
- Thank you so much for this. And...
- Got to go, Bruce.

1013
00:58:56,116 --> 00:58:59,541
I'm smoking over here.
Downloading missing Russian cosmonauts.

1014
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:02,501
Turns out the Soviets cancelled
a manned mission to the moon.

1015
00:59:02,723 --> 00:59:04,441
The moon, in 1972.

1016
00:59:04,533 --> 00:59:06,911
And two of their cosmonauts
went into hiding in America.

1017
00:59:06,994 --> 00:59:08,712
And I just found them alive.

1018
00:59:08,812 --> 00:59:10,029
You're a genius, Brains.

1019
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:17,354
That was smooth, Bumblebee.

1020
00:59:20,724 --> 00:59:22,647
Missed it by that much.

1021
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:26,813
Hi.

1022
00:59:27,056 --> 00:59:29,257
Would somebody care to tell
me what the hell's going on?

1023
00:59:29,345 --> 00:59:31,439
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

1024
00:59:31,539 --> 00:59:34,088
Who am I? Who is that?
Dutch! Frisk her!

1025
00:59:34,508 --> 00:59:35,555
Certainly.

1026
00:59:35,643 --> 00:59:37,736
No. Dutch.

1027
00:59:37,822 --> 00:59:39,074
Don't touch me.

1028
00:59:39,174 --> 00:59:40,721
- I'm not gonna touch her.
- Sam?

1029
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:42,587
Angel.

1030
00:59:43,939 --> 00:59:45,941
I was working.
I'm sorry about this.

1031
00:59:46,041 --> 00:59:48,590
- Great. We're homeless.
- She lives here? Wow.

1032
00:59:49,064 --> 00:59:50,862
You had your chance
to frisk her.

1033
00:59:50,954 --> 00:59:53,958
- I have a girlfriend.
- Really? What's her name?

1034
00:59:54,058 --> 00:59:55,230
Índia.

1035
00:59:56,652 --> 00:59:58,620
We're supposed to be at Dylan's party,
remember?

1036
00:59:58,707 --> 01:00:00,176
I do remember,
but these are my friends.

1037
01:00:00,257 --> 01:00:01,726
They need me.
I have to be here right now.

1038
01:00:01,806 --> 01:00:05,106
So, what, the Autobots and the military,
they can't handle this on their own?

1039
01:00:05,187 --> 01:00:07,440
You know what I liked about
your war stories, Sam?

1040
01:00:07,518 --> 01:00:09,611
It's that they were stories,
they were in the past.

1041
01:00:09,692 --> 01:00:11,444
Look, I know you're thinking
about your brother; Okay?

1042
01:00:11,498 --> 01:00:14,140
And you're thinking about your family.
And it's not that situation.

1043
01:00:14,208 --> 01:00:15,210
- No?
- No.

1044
01:00:15,286 --> 01:00:18,039
Why not? Why isn't it, Sam?

1045
01:00:18,139 --> 01:00:21,109
You think we'd rather have his medals,
or we'd rather have him?

1046
01:00:22,386 --> 01:00:25,981
I hear you. I get it.
Where are you taking my bunny? Stop!

1047
01:00:26,069 --> 01:00:27,412
Just stop for a second.

1048
01:00:27,493 --> 01:00:28,961
You think I could sleep last night?

1049
01:00:29,041 --> 01:00:31,339
And then it hit me.
No, Sam wants to be in danger.

1050
01:00:31,439 --> 01:00:34,033
- He doesn't know who he is without it.
- I just want to matter.

1051
01:00:35,173 --> 01:00:36,800
You matter to me.

1052
01:00:42,531 --> 01:00:44,291
I know you're worried.
I know you're worried.

1053
01:00:44,391 --> 01:00:46,485
But I promise you,
I can handle this.

1054
01:00:47,202 --> 01:00:48,795
Can you? You can promise it?

1055
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:50,238
I promise.

1056
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:54,905
Sam, I don't want to lose you,
and I know where this leads.

1057
01:00:57,571 --> 01:00:59,539
I'm not ready for this.

1058
01:01:00,924 --> 01:01:02,642
Are you coming with me?

1059
01:01:02,742 --> 01:01:04,164
I can't.

1060
01:01:05,579 --> 01:01:06,671
Okay.

1061
01:01:12,043 --> 01:01:13,511
Hey.

1062
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:19,301
Here's your foot.

1063
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:32,606
The warrior's path is a solitary one.

1064
01:01:33,749 --> 01:01:35,717
How the hell
did she afford that car?

1065
01:01:35,809 --> 01:01:38,187
- Her boss.
- Rich bastards!

1066
01:01:38,287 --> 01:01:40,756
I used to hate them.
Now, it's...

1067
01:01:42,598 --> 01:01:45,852
Going to a gig on the hunt
for two Russian cosmonauts.

1068
01:01:45,944 --> 01:01:48,072
Nothing like driving in a Maybach.

1069
01:01:48,172 --> 01:01:50,140
Germans know how to make cars,
let me tell you.

1070
01:01:51,766 --> 01:01:55,987
My Dutchman,
former NSA cybersleuth extraordinaire,

1071
01:01:56,087 --> 01:01:57,339
tracked them down here.

1072
01:01:58,941 --> 01:02:01,660
So, these cosmonauts went into hiding.
Why?

1073
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:03,137
Bingo. I got a match.

1074
01:02:04,446 --> 01:02:06,039
You're a German Shepherd, Dutch.

1075
01:02:06,131 --> 01:02:09,385
The thing about Russians is,
they never like to talk.

1076
01:02:09,485 --> 01:02:12,238
It's gonna take a little of the
"international language."

1077
01:02:17,776 --> 01:02:19,653
That means "good-bye."

1078
01:02:33,667 --> 01:02:35,089
Stay loose.

1079
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:38,005
Dutch, give me something tough.

1080
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:42,008
Baryshnikov.

1081
01:02:42,217 --> 01:02:43,389
We do speak English.

1082
01:02:43,677 --> 01:02:45,179
Dutch, you suck.

1083
01:02:45,995 --> 01:02:48,248
It's a Cyrillic alphabet.

1084
01:02:48,348 --> 01:02:51,352
It's like all the buttons
you never push on a calculator!

1085
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:53,712
I don't suck.

1086
01:02:53,803 --> 01:02:56,932
Agent Seymour Simmons, Sector
Eight, formerly Seven.

1087
01:02:57,015 --> 01:02:59,985
We know who you are,
cosmonautchiks.

1088
01:03:00,066 --> 01:03:01,113
So what?

1089
01:03:01,191 --> 01:03:04,161
You were supposed to travel
to the dark side of the moon,

1090
01:03:04,261 --> 01:03:06,980
then it all got shut down.

1091
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:11,750
The question is, why?

1092
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:18,845
"Can my child smoke in here?"

1093
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:27,853
Okay, all right. Okay.

1094
01:03:29,097 --> 01:03:30,144
Go ahead, shoot me.

1095
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:33,643
I'm willing to die for my country.
Are you?

1096
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:36,146
Really?

1097
01:03:36,482 --> 01:03:38,882
You are beautiful. Has anyone
ever told you you're beautiful?

1098
01:03:38,982 --> 01:03:40,154
She's a beautiful woman.

1099
01:03:44,904 --> 01:03:46,076
Hey!

1100
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:51,248
Dutch! Back in the cage.

1101
01:03:52,412 --> 01:03:54,380
Dutch! Hold, Dutch, hold!

1102
01:03:54,636 --> 01:03:56,316
Control your boy, please.
Control your boy.

1103
01:03:56,416 --> 01:03:57,588
Dutch, stop!

1104
01:04:03,114 --> 01:04:05,367
I'm so sorry.
That is the old me.

1105
01:04:05,459 --> 01:04:07,211
Okay, let's everybody
just calm down!

1106
01:04:07,311 --> 01:04:10,781
Let's lower the heat, lower the guns.
Let's relax. World War II is over.

1107
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:17,275
You are about to see one of
the biggest Soviet secrets.

1108
01:04:18,830 --> 01:04:21,174
America first to send
man to the moon.

1109
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:23,948
But USSR first to send camera.

1110
01:04:24,757 --> 01:04:27,806
In 1959, our Luna 3

1111
01:04:27,906 --> 01:04:31,160
take picture of the dark,
the shadow side.

1112
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:33,628
Sees nothing.

1113
01:04:34,771 --> 01:04:38,275
But in 1963, Luna 4 sees...

1114
01:04:38,366 --> 01:04:40,494
- Strange rocks.
- Yeah.

1115
01:04:40,579 --> 01:04:43,628
Around the ship.
Hundreds of them.

1116
01:04:43,728 --> 01:04:45,480
Yeah, show picture.

1117
01:04:46,299 --> 01:04:49,223
With some drag marks.

1118
01:04:53,181 --> 01:04:55,342
I've seen these.
These aren't rocks, these are pillars.

1119
01:04:55,784 --> 01:04:58,003
Alien pillars for a space bridge.

1120
01:04:58,061 --> 01:05:00,381
We know about them because
the Autobots have five of these.

1121
01:05:00,451 --> 01:05:04,581
The Decepticons must have raided the ship
before Apollo 11 ever got there,

1122
01:05:04,656 --> 01:05:07,079
took the pillars, and hid them.

1123
01:05:07,156 --> 01:05:08,203
It doesn't make sense.

1124
01:05:08,283 --> 01:05:10,285
The Decepticons have the ship.
They have all those pillars.

1125
01:05:10,329 --> 01:05:11,489
Why would they leave Sentinel

1126
01:05:11,589 --> 01:05:13,432
when he's the only one
who can use them?

1127
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:15,253
Unless...

1128
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:17,588
He's the one thing they still need.

1129
01:05:18,039 --> 01:05:20,959
We've got to meet up with Sentinel,
rendezvous with him and keep him safe.

1130
01:05:21,034 --> 01:05:23,594
Mearing, I just picked up Sentinel.
Optimus is 10 minutes behind.

1131
01:05:23,694 --> 01:05:24,820
We're coming to NEST now.

1132
01:05:27,233 --> 01:05:29,034
Mr Witwicky, I thought
I made it clear to you

1133
01:05:29,125 --> 01:05:30,627
that I did not want you
calling this phone.

1134
01:05:30,711 --> 01:05:33,430
<i>Listen, the whole thing has been
a setup since the beginning.

1135
01:05:33,513 --> 01:05:35,641
The Decepticons wanted
Optimus to find Sentinel

1136
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:37,438
because only Optimus
could revive him.

1137
01:05:37,519 --> 01:05:39,271
But we have the space bridge.

1138
01:05:39,353 --> 01:05:42,607
Mearing, you have five pillars. I
just learned that they have hundreds.

1139
01:05:42,688 --> 01:05:43,985
<i>You're doing exactly what
they wanted you to do.

1140
01:05:44,063 --> 01:05:45,280
<i>What do you need me
to say to you?

1141
01:05:45,380 --> 01:05:47,883
The Decepticons are coming
for Sentinel Prime!

1142
01:05:48,027 --> 01:05:49,119
We're going to NEST.

1143
01:05:53,971 --> 01:05:55,393
<i>We have an Energon alert.

1144
01:05:55,493 --> 01:05:57,871
<i>Energon readings detected
on the D.C. parkway.

1145
01:05:59,164 --> 01:06:01,883
Currently tracking three black Suburbans.

1146
01:06:36,201 --> 01:06:38,681
Bee, you got to get Sentinel out of here!
You got to guard him!

1147
01:06:47,795 --> 01:06:49,923
Oh, <i>mein Gott!</i> I'm fired!

1148
01:06:54,511 --> 01:06:55,791
Watch out! Watch out! Watch out!

1149
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:14,281
Got you!

1150
01:07:15,448 --> 01:07:17,416
Shoot him! Shoot him!
Shoot him, Bee!

1151
01:07:45,937 --> 01:07:47,905
Bee, you've got to move faster!
Faster, Bee! Go!

1152
01:07:51,568 --> 01:07:52,740
Bee!

1153
01:08:14,841 --> 01:08:15,967
All right, back to NEST!

1154
01:08:23,391 --> 01:08:24,938
Dino, I got him!

1155
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:34,986
Ironhide!

1156
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:01,353
Is there a problem?

1157
01:09:02,722 --> 01:09:04,895
A little Mexican standoff we got here.

1158
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:06,818
Weapons down.

1159
01:09:07,101 --> 01:09:09,945
And we'll let you escape
with your dignity.

1160
01:09:14,233 --> 01:09:15,530
Drop them.

1161
01:09:17,403 --> 01:09:18,825
That's good.

1162
01:09:22,742 --> 01:09:24,540
Ironhide, watch out!

1163
01:09:30,124 --> 01:09:31,751
Ironhide, catch!

1164
01:09:37,423 --> 01:09:38,800
Behind you!

1165
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:44,188
Decepticon punk!

1166
01:09:52,313 --> 01:09:53,940
Class dismissed.

1167
01:09:59,779 --> 01:10:02,578
- Get inside! Let's go!
- Move! Keep moving!

1168
01:10:03,304 --> 01:10:04,851
- Lennox!
- Go, go, go!

1169
01:10:04,906 --> 01:10:06,106
We got Decepticons everywhere.

1170
01:10:06,206 --> 01:10:08,526
I've got my whole team deployed
looking for them. Ironhide!

1171
01:10:09,105 --> 01:10:10,857
Protect Sentinel! Get
him locked up inside!

1172
01:10:10,948 --> 01:10:12,200
Consider it done!

1173
01:10:12,286 --> 01:10:14,584
Hey, you've got to guard him, 'cause
he's the key to the whole thing.

1174
01:10:14,668 --> 01:10:19,424
Indeed, I am. What you must realize,
my Autobot brothers,

1175
01:10:19,524 --> 01:10:22,152
is we were never going to
win the war.

1176
01:10:22,677 --> 01:10:27,103
For the sake of our planet's survival,
a deal had to be made

1177
01:10:28,099 --> 01:10:29,601
with Megatron.

1178
01:10:36,399 --> 01:10:39,323
- Get back!
- What have you done?

1179
01:10:40,486 --> 01:10:43,706
I hereby discharge you from duty.

1180
01:10:49,787 --> 01:10:50,959
- Bee!
- Get back!

1181
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:08,748
Rally all NEST forces back to the base!
Come on!

1182
01:11:08,848 --> 01:11:09,849
No...

1183
01:11:18,542 --> 01:11:19,634
Get a medic down here!

1184
01:11:19,734 --> 01:11:23,238
We don't have enough men!
Do not engage Sentinel!

1185
01:11:23,613 --> 01:11:24,865
Just go to the back gate.

1186
01:11:30,328 --> 01:11:31,705
Take cover!

1187
01:11:35,249 --> 01:11:36,501
Watch left! Watch left!

1188
01:11:36,834 --> 01:11:38,711
Let's go! Follow me!

1189
01:11:48,158 --> 01:11:50,081
- Director, don't go there!
- Stand down!

1190
01:11:50,181 --> 01:11:51,273
Hey, Sentinel!

1191
01:11:51,371 --> 01:11:53,044
- Director!
- What is going on?

1192
01:11:53,144 --> 01:11:54,441
What do you think you are doing?

1193
01:11:57,714 --> 01:11:59,716
I am a Prime!

1194
01:11:59,816 --> 01:12:02,194
I do not take orders from you.

1195
01:12:03,503 --> 01:12:04,595
Director Mearing, come on.

1196
01:12:04,684 --> 01:12:06,483
We can't fight him. Let's go.
We have to go.

1197
01:12:06,583 --> 01:12:10,053
Now return what belongs to me!

1198
01:12:11,702 --> 01:12:13,579
Oh, my God!

1199
01:12:27,635 --> 01:12:29,979
- You guys okay?
- Is everybody out?

1200
01:12:30,304 --> 01:12:32,352
Everybody, stay calm.
You're gonna be fine.

1201
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:45,094
Yeah, take a look, Optimus!
This is all on you!

1202
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:47,196
Sentinel hit the vault!
Took the pillars.

1203
01:12:48,763 --> 01:12:52,518
Come on, let's go.
All right, notify the 101st Airborne!

1204
01:12:52,618 --> 01:12:54,962
We need to hunt this thing down!

1205
01:13:01,127 --> 01:13:02,299
Carly!

1206
01:13:05,423 --> 01:13:07,300
Hot from our little campfire.

1207
01:13:07,633 --> 01:13:09,431
S'mores. Isn't that great?

1208
01:13:09,635 --> 01:13:11,353
We're really living off the land.

1209
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:14,223
Mom, Dad, have you guys
seen Carly come home yet?

1210
01:13:14,464 --> 01:13:16,584
Excuse me. Can you knock, please?
This is our bedroom.

1211
01:13:16,657 --> 01:13:17,778
Why wouldn't she be at home?

1212
01:13:17,854 --> 01:13:20,778
We had a fight and we
might have broken up,

1213
01:13:20,854 --> 01:13:21,947
or be on a break.
I don't really know.

1214
01:13:22,023 --> 01:13:24,242
- What? No.
- Look, I can't talk about it right now.

1215
01:13:24,321 --> 01:13:26,573
I can't go into details, Mom.
I have to find her.

1216
01:13:26,673 --> 01:13:29,643
Sit down. We're having a family meeting.
Family meeting!

1217
01:13:29,764 --> 01:13:30,890
You may not know this,

1218
01:13:30,980 --> 01:13:33,403
but your father and I were not always
this perfectly happy.

1219
01:13:33,488 --> 01:13:34,910
You know, there was
a time in our marriage

1220
01:13:35,010 --> 01:13:36,690
when I thought this was
not gonna work out.

1221
01:13:36,913 --> 01:13:38,711
- Can we please not?
- She's damaging him.

1222
01:13:38,890 --> 01:13:41,359
You break up with one
world-class hottie...

1223
01:13:41,451 --> 01:13:42,953
No. Stop. Stop, okay?
She dumped me,

1224
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:45,042
I moved on to something better. That's it.
I'm a happier person.

1225
01:13:45,127 --> 01:13:46,128
The second beautiful girl,
and you lose her.

1226
01:13:46,228 --> 01:13:47,229
Why don't you help me?

1227
01:13:47,489 --> 01:13:49,617
- They had an argument.
- One fight.

1228
01:13:49,708 --> 01:13:52,587
You're not gonna get a third one,
I mean, unless you have like a big...

1229
01:13:52,674 --> 01:13:53,926
What the... Ma!

1230
01:13:54,009 --> 01:13:56,432
Maybe you just don't know
what you're doing.

1231
01:13:56,511 --> 01:13:58,605
- I don't want to talk about this any more.
- You need the book.

1232
01:13:58,684 --> 01:14:00,732
- Tell him about the book.
- You're always wrong. Get used to it.

1233
01:14:00,809 --> 01:14:02,611
Okay. You've gotta read this.
She Comes First.

1234
01:14:02,689 --> 01:14:04,737
- There's some killer shit in here.
- No. No.

1235
01:14:04,837 --> 01:14:07,306
- That's it, I'm going.
- No! No!

1236
01:14:07,526 --> 01:14:09,949
Sit down, sit down! Back me up!

1237
01:14:10,504 --> 01:14:12,723
- Happy wife, happy life.
- Heck yeah.

1238
01:14:12,811 --> 01:14:16,281
Unhappy wife,
stone-cold misery for the rest of your...

1239
01:14:16,381 --> 01:14:17,633
- Stop.
- It's true.

1240
01:14:17,828 --> 01:14:19,876
All I'm saying is,
do you love this girl?

1241
01:14:20,373 --> 01:14:22,546
- She's the one.
- Then you gotta go get her.

1242
01:14:22,729 --> 01:14:24,902
I mean, your dad and I,
when we had troubles,

1243
01:14:24,992 --> 01:14:27,666
he moved heaven and earth
to find me.

1244
01:14:27,748 --> 01:14:30,342
Say what you said. Say it.

1245
01:14:30,442 --> 01:14:33,070
"I will follow you
to the end of time."

1246
01:14:33,528 --> 01:14:34,620
Does that suck or what?

1247
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:36,760
- It's like a bad sci-fi film.
- No. It is so sweet.

1248
01:14:37,334 --> 01:14:40,334
I want you to get out of the city.
You get as far away from here as you can.

1249
01:14:40,434 --> 01:14:41,435
You understand?

1250
01:14:41,769 --> 01:14:42,770
I love you.

1251
01:15:02,981 --> 01:15:06,360
My master!
Such a brilliant scheme!

1252
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:10,636
So when Sentinel left Cybertron,
it was to defect?

1253
01:15:10,906 --> 01:15:14,410
He was meant to rendezvous
with me here on Earth

1254
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:16,763
before fate waylaid us both.

1255
01:15:17,030 --> 01:15:19,624
The only way to revive him,

1256
01:15:19,724 --> 01:15:22,603
we needed Prime and his Matrix.

1257
01:15:22,768 --> 01:15:24,770
Excellent strategy.

1258
01:15:33,946 --> 01:15:35,823
Mine, mine!

1259
01:15:37,033 --> 01:15:39,786
So he is now your partner, master?

1260
01:15:39,969 --> 01:15:43,439
He is my greatest triumph.

1261
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:44,836
So impressive.

1262
01:15:45,166 --> 01:15:47,419
Commencing transport.

1263
01:15:47,522 --> 01:15:50,321
Stop! No! No, Sentinel!

1264
01:15:50,421 --> 01:15:51,889
Forgive me.

1265
01:15:55,860 --> 01:15:57,828
Here we are.

1266
01:15:57,928 --> 01:15:59,805
Fight us now.

1267
01:16:38,828 --> 01:16:39,829
Contact!

1268
01:16:39,929 --> 01:16:41,977
Watch out! Move it! Move it!

1269
01:16:45,184 --> 01:16:47,357
Autobots, retreat!

1270
01:17:14,505 --> 01:17:16,052
Why, Sentinel, why?

1271
01:17:16,507 --> 01:17:19,181
For Cybertron! For our home!

1272
01:17:19,613 --> 01:17:24,790
What war destroyed, we can rebuild!
But only if we join with the Decepticons.

1273
01:17:24,878 --> 01:17:29,975
No, it's not the only way. This is our home!
We must defend the humans!

1274
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:32,438
So lost you are, Optimus.

1275
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:34,568
On Cybertron, we were gods.

1276
01:17:34,651 --> 01:17:38,155
And here, they call us machines.

1277
01:17:38,255 --> 01:17:41,976
Let the humans serve
us, or perish.

1278
01:17:44,535 --> 01:17:49,257
You're lucky I didn't kill you.
In time you'll see.

1279
01:17:50,416 --> 01:17:52,418
It's not over.

1280
01:17:55,087 --> 01:17:59,263
Now, if I were him, I wouldn't let you
out of my sight for one second.

1281
01:18:01,332 --> 01:18:03,412
It's funny.
I was just thinking on the way over here,

1282
01:18:03,502 --> 01:18:05,550
I could really use some advice from Dylan,
and there he is.

1283
01:18:05,635 --> 01:18:07,182
- Can I speak to you, Carly?
- Welcome. Please, sit down.

1284
01:18:07,282 --> 01:18:08,408
Have a drink.

1285
01:18:08,742 --> 01:18:11,712
You know what, I don't need a drink.
Or a car, or a job.

1286
01:18:11,802 --> 01:18:13,224
I just need
to speak to my girlfriend alone.

1287
01:18:13,324 --> 01:18:14,964
Is that okay with you, Mr Inappropriate?

1288
01:18:16,817 --> 01:18:18,114
Excuse me.

1289
01:18:20,821 --> 01:18:23,165
- What's going on?
- I'll tell you outside.

1290
01:18:23,761 --> 01:18:25,434
I really think I can help you, Sam.

1291
01:18:25,522 --> 01:18:28,116
I remember a talk I had with my dad once
about tough choices.

1292
01:18:28,198 --> 01:18:30,041
Yeah, now's not the time.
We'll set something up, though.

1293
01:18:30,123 --> 01:18:32,376
Of course, it was way back,
when my dad's firm was in charge

1294
01:18:32,476 --> 01:18:35,195
of budget review and accounting for NASA.

1295
01:18:36,262 --> 01:18:37,863
You see,
the thing that he taught me was,

1296
01:18:37,963 --> 01:18:41,137
when it's not your war,
you join the side that's going to win.

1297
01:18:43,077 --> 01:18:44,078
Move.

1298
01:18:44,166 --> 01:18:45,634
Too direct? Or is it just me?

1299
01:18:45,734 --> 01:18:46,781
Certainly not you, sir.

1300
01:19:00,611 --> 01:19:01,863
You're mine!

1301
01:19:02,613 --> 01:19:03,660
No!

1302
01:19:06,784 --> 01:19:08,627
- Get help!
- Sam, I can't get out!

1303
01:19:08,866 --> 01:19:10,146
- Someone get help!
- Good night!

1304
01:19:10,236 --> 01:19:11,283
Good night, Mr Dylan.

1305
01:19:11,383 --> 01:19:13,385
Get me out of here!

1306
01:19:16,727 --> 01:19:19,071
Help! Get help!

1307
01:19:19,171 --> 01:19:22,175
- He's young. He will learn. Good night.
- Get me out!

1308
01:19:22,299 --> 01:19:23,516
It was a fun night.

1309
01:19:23,988 --> 01:19:28,289
You really think you're the first man
ever asked to join the noble alien cause?

1310
01:19:28,377 --> 01:19:29,720
Who are you?

1311
01:19:29,820 --> 01:19:32,915
Do you know why we've not
been back to the moon since 1972?

1312
01:19:33,043 --> 01:19:34,795
Because these two,

1313
01:19:34,885 --> 01:19:37,934
they came to my dad and they told him
to do some creative accounting.

1314
01:19:38,017 --> 01:19:40,611
Make it way too expensive to ever go back.
So, he and the others

1315
01:19:40,690 --> 01:19:43,034
shut down the American and
Russian space programs.

1316
01:19:43,115 --> 01:19:45,116
And they've been our clients ever since.

1317
01:19:45,214 --> 01:19:47,894
- You helped them kill people?
- You think they'd give you a choice?

1318
01:19:47,994 --> 01:19:49,667
Besides,
it's not like I personally participated.

1319
01:19:49,868 --> 01:19:51,791
I am a liaison. I liaise.

1320
01:19:55,374 --> 01:19:56,717
It's hostile takeover time, Sam.

1321
01:19:59,295 --> 01:20:00,547
Sam!

1322
01:20:03,482 --> 01:20:05,576
- Sam!
- Let her go!

1323
01:20:05,676 --> 01:20:07,849
Sam!

1324
01:20:10,889 --> 01:20:12,891
I've had my eye on you
for years, Sam.

1325
01:20:13,034 --> 01:20:15,002
You're the one spy I've
never been able to provide

1326
01:20:15,102 --> 01:20:16,570
as someone close to the Autobots.

1327
01:20:20,045 --> 01:20:22,218
Sam! Don't do what he wants!

1328
01:20:22,310 --> 01:20:23,937
Yes, he will.

1329
01:20:24,037 --> 01:20:25,084
They all do.

1330
01:20:27,806 --> 01:20:29,558
They will slaughter her,
you understand me?

1331
01:20:29,648 --> 01:20:33,198
In the time it takes you to blink,
they'll do it to her and they'll do it to me.

1332
01:20:33,282 --> 01:20:35,080
So you show a little respect

1333
01:20:35,180 --> 01:20:37,433
when someone offers you a job!

1334
01:20:38,751 --> 01:20:40,048
Wrist.

1335
01:20:40,686 --> 01:20:42,279
You are to track down Optimus Prime,

1336
01:20:42,371 --> 01:20:44,248
because you're the one human
he trusts,

1337
01:20:44,334 --> 01:20:45,881
and you will ask one question.

1338
01:20:45,981 --> 01:20:50,031
How does he intend to fight back?
Strategies, tactics, everything!

1339
01:20:55,576 --> 01:20:58,170
Has a nasty little bite, doesn't it?
It's very high-tech.

1340
01:20:58,260 --> 01:21:00,809
It lets us see what you see,
hear what you hear

1341
01:21:00,891 --> 01:21:02,234
and it taps your nervous system.

1342
01:21:02,334 --> 01:21:04,712
So, if you so much as try and signal...

1343
01:21:07,004 --> 01:21:08,597
I don't know what to tell you, Sam.

1344
01:21:08,687 --> 01:21:11,736
Relationships have consequences.
I am here because of my father.

1345
01:21:11,836 --> 01:21:13,258
She is here because of you.

1346
01:21:15,788 --> 01:21:18,132
Stop, stop! Stop! Stop!

1347
01:21:18,749 --> 01:21:20,001
Soundwave, would you please?

1348
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:26,223
Sam, do your job.

1349
01:21:26,632 --> 01:21:29,135
She'll be safe.
I give you my word.

1350
01:21:31,845 --> 01:21:34,473
I'll kill you. You have my word.

1351
01:21:37,309 --> 01:21:40,483
Combatant Commands are now at DEFCON 1.

1352
01:21:40,771 --> 01:21:43,320
Approximately 200 Decepticons
are now in hiding.

1353
01:21:43,757 --> 01:21:45,259
Energon detectors have been triggered

1354
01:21:45,359 --> 01:21:47,532
as far away as South America and China.

1355
01:21:47,886 --> 01:21:50,639
The U.N. just received
an encrypted audio file.

1356
01:21:50,731 --> 01:21:53,484
They say it's from the leader
of the Autobots.

1357
01:21:53,568 --> 01:21:55,161
Defenders of Earth.

1358
01:21:55,242 --> 01:21:57,916
We have come for your natural resources

1359
01:21:58,016 --> 01:22:00,144
to rebuild our damaged planet.

1360
01:22:01,058 --> 01:22:03,152
When we have transported all we need,

1361
01:22:03,242 --> 01:22:06,291
we will leave your world in peace.

1362
01:22:06,375 --> 01:22:08,298
For such peace to exist,

1363
01:22:08,398 --> 01:22:13,154
you must immediately exile
the Autobot rebels you have harbored.

1364
01:22:14,012 --> 01:22:15,514
Nonnegotiable.

1365
01:22:16,014 --> 01:22:17,516
Renounce the rebels.

1366
01:22:18,058 --> 01:22:20,481
We await your reply.

1367
01:22:21,162 --> 01:22:22,755
We'll debrief you in transit.

1368
01:22:22,844 --> 01:22:24,267
Yeah, I really don't see how
I can be of any help.

1369
01:22:24,350 --> 01:22:25,442
I mean, you guys seem pretty busy.

1370
01:22:25,542 --> 01:22:27,385
We could just do this another time,
I think.

1371
01:22:30,842 --> 01:22:33,015
I have underestimated you at every turn.

1372
01:22:33,107 --> 01:22:34,359
What?

1373
01:22:34,442 --> 01:22:36,285
You warned us that they
were using humans.

1374
01:22:36,366 --> 01:22:38,039
And you knew that Sentinel
was the key.

1375
01:22:38,139 --> 01:22:39,356
Director!

1376
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:43,050
Who am I? Hey, you're the expert.
I'm just a walking security risk.

1377
01:22:49,256 --> 01:22:50,428
Are you all right?

1378
01:22:52,384 --> 01:22:53,510
Yes.

1379
01:22:53,753 --> 01:22:55,954
- No, you're not. You're sweating.
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

1380
01:22:56,046 --> 01:22:57,172
I'm sweating because I'm nervous.

1381
01:22:57,255 --> 01:22:59,349
I'm nervous because you got me in here
with this information.

1382
01:22:59,431 --> 01:23:00,728
Okay, I'm a Twitter junkie.
I blog everything.

1383
01:23:00,810 --> 01:23:02,562
- I can't keep a secret to save my life.
- You wouldn't dare.

1384
01:23:02,662 --> 01:23:05,742
- That's the truth. I'm telling you.
- Director, the Pentagon's calling in 15.

1385
01:23:07,232 --> 01:23:09,272
- What are you doing?
- Nothing. What are you doing?

1386
01:23:10,253 --> 01:23:11,470
Get away from me.

1387
01:23:11,558 --> 01:23:14,402
<i>It's been a remarkable series of events
today at the Capitol.

1388
01:23:14,486 --> 01:23:16,534
<i>Just moments ago,
legislation was passed

1389
01:23:16,613 --> 01:23:19,499
<i>to exile the Autobots
from American shores.

1390
01:23:19,578 --> 01:23:22,878
<i>The U.S. Military alliance with them
is officially overt.

1391
01:23:22,959 --> 01:23:24,711
<i>In the words of the
House Majority Leader...

1392
01:23:24,793 --> 01:23:26,545
<i>The sponsor of today's resolution,

1393
01:23:26,626 --> 01:23:27,798
<i>- "”We cannot in good conscience..."</i>
- Okay.

1394
01:23:27,876 --> 01:23:29,594
What? They can't do this.

1395
01:23:29,670 --> 01:23:32,640
- You gotta tell them. They can't do that.
- Okay. It's official. It's a go, people.

1396
01:23:32,718 --> 01:23:35,016
These are our allies. The Autobots fought for us.
They fought with us.

1397
01:23:35,094 --> 01:23:36,142
And where are we now?

1398
01:23:36,220 --> 01:23:37,767
Facing an enemy invasion

1399
01:23:37,867 --> 01:23:40,541
with an enemy that has the means
to deploy countless more.

1400
01:23:44,036 --> 01:23:45,504
If there is any more you know,

1401
01:23:45,604 --> 01:23:48,107
anything at all about
the enemy's intentions,

1402
01:23:49,483 --> 01:23:50,780
now is the time to tell.

1403
01:23:52,110 --> 01:23:53,953
Autobots have no way of
leaving this planet.

1404
01:23:54,446 --> 01:23:55,948
And that is where you're wrong.

1405
01:23:56,990 --> 01:23:58,992
Its name is the <i>Xanthium</i>.

1406
01:23:59,499 --> 01:24:01,019
It brought the second
wave of Autobots

1407
01:24:01,119 --> 01:24:03,622
and it's been under NASA's
care and study ever since.

1408
01:24:04,439 --> 01:24:06,191
We linked it with a
decommissioned shuttle

1409
01:24:06,281 --> 01:24:08,955
to maintain military control
until they're gone.

1410
01:24:09,041 --> 01:24:13,171
Gonna be 10,000 pounds of torque
on that itsy-bitsy bolt, not 19!

1411
01:24:13,271 --> 01:24:15,649
You're gonna risk the lives of all me mates!
I'll ball you!

1412
01:24:16,485 --> 01:24:19,204
These guys are the Wreckers.
They take care of the <i>Xanthium</i>.

1413
01:24:19,291 --> 01:24:21,385
We don't let them off the base much,
'cause they're assholes.

1414
01:24:21,469 --> 01:24:23,517
You gotta pull that,
ya nancy wanker!

1415
01:24:23,596 --> 01:24:25,064
It's time to kill him!

1416
01:24:25,143 --> 01:24:27,066
I'm just trying to help, you know.
Just doing my job.

1417
01:24:27,144 --> 01:24:29,612
Just calm down. Leave him alone.
This is a human being.

1418
01:24:29,688 --> 01:24:31,782
- Epps!
- You are ridiculous!

1419
01:24:31,862 --> 01:24:33,114
- Is that you?
- What up, man?

1420
01:24:33,193 --> 01:24:34,991
What are you doing here?

1421
01:24:35,091 --> 01:24:36,684
I retired from the Air Force.

1422
01:24:37,155 --> 01:24:38,498
Can you let my hand go?

1423
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:41,043
What the hell was that?

1424
01:24:41,301 --> 01:24:43,395
Now I just consult
to run interference for them.

1425
01:24:43,487 --> 01:24:44,739
Well, you're not helping!

1426
01:24:44,823 --> 01:24:48,124
No more combat and aliens shooting
at my ass. I got a dream job.

1427
01:24:48,206 --> 01:24:50,129
Time to get off this planet.

1428
01:24:50,229 --> 01:24:53,608
Kicking the Autobots out.
Can you believe this is happening?

1429
01:24:54,464 --> 01:24:57,183
- Where do you think it's taking them?
- Any planet but here.

1430
01:25:00,637 --> 01:25:02,731
I wanna talk to whoever's in charge here!

1431
01:25:03,682 --> 01:25:07,528
Well, well, well.
Charlotte Mearing.

1432
01:25:07,832 --> 01:25:10,255
Agent Simmons.
Former Agent Simmons.

1433
01:25:10,347 --> 01:25:12,600
So I see you survived Washington

1434
01:25:12,700 --> 01:25:16,671
Washington, Egypt, heartbreak.
I survive. I will survive.

1435
01:25:17,404 --> 01:25:21,034
They're bringing everybody in, kid.
Putting all the intel on the table.

1436
01:25:21,344 --> 01:25:26,396
And if you think deporting nine Autobots
is gonna solve a damn thing...

1437
01:25:26,496 --> 01:25:27,748
It's out of my hands.

1438
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:30,292
Moving up in the world?

1439
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:34,384
Your booty looks excellent.

1440
01:25:37,775 --> 01:25:39,243
If you ever say a word to anyone

1441
01:25:39,343 --> 01:25:41,023
about what happened
that night in Quantico,

1442
01:25:41,511 --> 01:25:42,763
I'll cut your heart out.

1443
01:25:43,513 --> 01:25:44,890
You already did.

1444
01:25:45,578 --> 01:25:48,627
Sammy, listen to me.
Don't let them exile us.

1445
01:25:48,727 --> 01:25:51,446
- Don't let them take us, Sam.
- It's a Decepticon trap.

1446
01:26:28,183 --> 01:26:31,278
Check the nitrogen levels.
We're booking out of here.

1447
01:26:33,939 --> 01:26:34,940
Optimus?

1448
01:26:35,107 --> 01:26:39,613
What your leaders say is true.
This was all my fault.

1449
01:26:40,153 --> 01:26:44,329
I told them whom to trust.
I was so wrong.

1450
01:26:44,533 --> 01:26:47,294
That doesn't make it your fault.
It just makes you human for a change.

1451
01:26:47,494 --> 01:26:48,837
Remember this.

1452
01:26:49,538 --> 01:26:51,791
You may lose your faith in us,

1453
01:26:52,457 --> 01:26:55,461
but never in yourselves.

1454
01:27:02,467 --> 01:27:04,344
I need to know how
you're gonna fight back.

1455
01:27:06,037 --> 01:27:08,665
I know this is strategy,
I know you're coming back

1456
01:27:08,765 --> 01:27:10,885
with reinforcements, something.
I know there's a plan.

1457
01:27:14,980 --> 01:27:17,324
You can tell me. No other
human will ever know.

1458
01:27:19,067 --> 01:27:20,489
There is no plan.

1459
01:27:22,154 --> 01:27:24,795
If we just do what they want,
how are we gonna live with ourselves?

1460
01:27:26,616 --> 01:27:28,664
You are my friend, Sam.

1461
01:27:29,661 --> 01:27:31,163
You always will be.

1462
01:27:31,872 --> 01:27:34,170
But your leaders have spoken.

1463
01:27:35,959 --> 01:27:37,427
From here,

1464
01:27:38,545 --> 01:27:40,639
the fight will be your own.

1465
01:27:54,311 --> 01:27:55,528
Make it short.

1466
01:27:56,521 --> 01:27:57,738
We're loading up.

1467
01:27:58,648 --> 01:28:02,369
All right, hustle up!
We're launching at dawn.

1468
01:28:05,672 --> 01:28:09,393
We're gonna do whatever we can.
Make it like it was.

1469
01:28:09,493 --> 01:28:12,747
You will always be my friend, Sam.

1470
01:28:13,580 --> 01:28:15,173
I gotta be going on.

1471
01:28:29,888 --> 01:28:31,765
Years from now,
they're gonna ask us,

1472
01:28:33,099 --> 01:28:35,227
"Where were you
when they took over the planet?"

1473
01:28:37,479 --> 01:28:38,856
We're gonna say...

1474
01:28:40,649 --> 01:28:42,401
"We just stood by and watched."

1475
01:28:56,373 --> 01:28:58,751
You should really look at this
as a partnership.

1476
01:28:59,646 --> 01:29:01,319
You have to stand on the side of progress

1477
01:29:01,419 --> 01:29:02,887
if you wanna be a part of history.

1478
01:29:15,934 --> 01:29:21,607
<i>Seven, six, five, four, three, two,

1479
01:29:22,065 --> 01:29:23,612
<i>one, zero.

1480
01:29:31,950 --> 01:29:33,543
<i>Go ahead and throttle up.

1481
01:29:51,553 --> 01:29:52,914
You wanted an answer.
You got one.

1482
01:29:53,346 --> 01:29:56,520
<i>I always get what I want, Sam.
We just needed to be sure.

1483
01:29:57,225 --> 01:29:58,317
Sure of what?

1484
01:29:58,435 --> 01:29:59,835
That they would go
without a fight.

1485
01:30:10,322 --> 01:30:12,165
<i>- Say again.
- We're tracking an incoming object.

1486
01:31:04,876 --> 01:31:06,316
We all work for the Decepticons now.

1487
01:31:11,646 --> 01:31:14,327
I need your help to track a phone call.
There's a man on this phone.

1488
01:31:14,416 --> 01:31:16,465
He's the head of their human operations
and he has Carly hostage.

1489
01:31:16,565 --> 01:31:18,408
I want you to sit down.
Don't move.

1490
01:31:20,642 --> 01:31:21,814
Follow me.

1491
01:31:22,727 --> 01:31:24,274
I'm watching him drive up right now.

1492
01:31:27,958 --> 01:31:29,801
The call was placed en route.

1493
01:31:29,901 --> 01:31:32,154
I'm hacking into the
phone's camera now.

1494
01:31:32,437 --> 01:31:34,598
There, that's it.
That's a live stream from the camera.

1495
01:31:34,698 --> 01:31:37,042
Someplace... Hold on.
I can triangulate this.

1496
01:31:38,243 --> 01:31:40,416
Okay, it's Chicago cell sites.
There, I've got it.

1497
01:31:40,745 --> 01:31:43,214
Trump Tower, Chicago.
Lower penthouse.

1498
01:31:43,373 --> 01:31:44,716
We're on.

1499
01:31:47,026 --> 01:31:48,778
- I'm going.
- You sure?

1500
01:31:48,845 --> 01:31:51,606
She's done nothing but try to help me,
and I can be there in 15 hours.

1501
01:31:51,706 --> 01:31:53,959
You're not going alone.

1502
01:31:56,403 --> 01:31:58,872
I still got my NEST friends out there.

1503
01:31:58,961 --> 01:32:00,885
I'll round them up,
we'll find your girlfriend,

1504
01:32:00,985 --> 01:32:02,328
we're gonna bring this guy in.

1505
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:03,977
Why are you helping me?

1506
01:32:04,644 --> 01:32:07,318
'Cause that asshole
killed my friends, too.

1507
01:32:23,430 --> 01:32:26,775
They said they were here for our resources,
to rebuild their planet.

1508
01:32:26,866 --> 01:32:30,120
Yes,
but really one resource in particular.

1509
01:32:30,220 --> 01:32:32,222
One unique to our planet.

1510
01:32:33,923 --> 01:32:35,220
Us?

1511
01:32:37,030 --> 01:32:38,703
You're very smart.

1512
01:32:38,803 --> 01:32:41,056
You see,
they can't rebuild without a slave labor force.

1513
01:32:41,622 --> 01:32:44,876
How many rocks up there in the universe
offer six billion workers?

1514
01:32:44,976 --> 01:32:48,150
What are you talking about?
We can't transport people.

1515
01:32:49,105 --> 01:32:51,654
They're not shipping people.
They're shipping their planet here.

1516
01:32:57,655 --> 01:32:59,077
Oh, my God.

1517
01:33:00,099 --> 01:33:01,726
What's Sentinel doing here?

1518
01:33:01,817 --> 01:33:05,572
Watch. They're spreading hundreds of
pillars around the globe right now.

1519
01:33:05,656 --> 01:33:08,250
In just a few hours,
they're gonna launch them into orbit

1520
01:33:08,332 --> 01:33:11,587
and bring Cybertron into our atmosphere.

1521
01:33:11,670 --> 01:33:13,798
The red one there controls the rest.

1522
01:33:13,879 --> 01:33:15,927
He triggers that,
it starts the whole thing.

1523
01:33:16,027 --> 01:33:19,907
Be gone, insect operative.
Your work is done.

1524
01:33:20,178 --> 01:33:22,351
Your Excellency.
He's such a dick.

1525
01:33:27,126 --> 01:33:30,130
- You want this to happen?
- I want to survive. I want 40 more years.

1526
01:33:30,219 --> 01:33:32,893
You think I asked for this?
I inherited a client.

1527
01:33:32,979 --> 01:33:35,607
Yeah, and when Cybertron's here
and we're all their slaves,

1528
01:33:35,665 --> 01:33:37,345
I guess they'll still need
a human leader.

1529
01:33:37,445 --> 01:33:39,789
Don't jinx me.
You want to survive, you listen to me.

1530
01:33:56,818 --> 01:34:01,619
It is time for the slaves of Earth
to recognize their masters.

1531
01:34:01,719 --> 01:34:03,346
Seal off the city.

1532
01:34:58,902 --> 01:35:01,121
Get the dogs outta here now!
Get them in the back!

1533
01:35:02,593 --> 01:35:04,766
I guess they didn't tell you about this part,
did they?

1534
01:35:04,853 --> 01:35:07,197
You think I'm at every meeting?

1535
01:35:07,283 --> 01:35:09,536
Look, I'm safe.

1536
01:35:09,636 --> 01:35:10,979
They said I was safe.

1537
01:35:22,675 --> 01:35:23,722
Let's roll!

1538
01:35:30,475 --> 01:35:31,977
We had a signal earlier.

1539
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:33,903
It's not working.

01:36:36,294 --> 01:36:38,843
We have Special Forces
trying to gain access to the city,

1552
01:36:39,026 --> 01:36:40,778
<i>and infantry is staging at the perimeter.

1553
01:36:40,868 --> 01:36:43,542
Excuse me, excuse me,
it just doesn't make sense!

1554
01:36:43,628 --> 01:36:46,131
Can't we get any eyes in there at all?

1555
01:36:46,214 --> 01:36:48,012
They Keep shooting down our drones.

1556
01:36:48,112 --> 01:36:49,455
<i>They want us blind.

1557
01:36:49,783 --> 01:36:52,582
<i>But we do have a couple of mini-drones
we're gonna try.

1558
01:36:52,672 --> 01:36:54,970
Well, whoever's manning these UAV drones,

1559
01:36:55,053 --> 01:36:57,021
can we try to redirect them
toward Trump Tower?

1560
01:36:57,121 --> 01:36:59,499
The kid, Witwickety,
was on his way to Chicago.

1561
01:36:59,772 --> 01:37:03,652
Said some point-man human op is there
for the Decepticons!

1562
01:37:04,202 --> 01:37:05,803
Listen, if I know anything,
I know this,

1563
01:37:05,903 --> 01:37:09,032
that kid is an alien-bad-news magnet.

1564
01:37:50,114 --> 01:37:51,707
My God.

1565
01:37:52,596 --> 01:37:55,270
We came here to find her
in the middle of all that?

1566
01:37:55,360 --> 01:37:57,783
Are we really going out there, Epps?

1567
01:37:57,883 --> 01:37:59,226
I'm not going in there.

1568
01:38:00,291 --> 01:38:01,634
No one's going in.

1569
01:38:08,383 --> 01:38:09,555
I am.

1570
01:38:11,052 --> 01:38:12,474
With or without you, I'll find her.

1571
01:38:13,471 --> 01:38:16,725
You're gonna get yourself killed, Sam.
Is that what you want?

1572
01:38:16,974 --> 01:38:18,351
Is that what you want?

1573
01:38:18,705 --> 01:38:21,504
You came all the way out here
to get yourself killed? Huh?

1574
01:38:21,594 --> 01:38:22,640
Listen to what I'm saying.

1575
01:38:22,727 --> 01:38:24,479
She's here because of me.
Do you understand?

1576
01:38:24,564 --> 01:38:28,319
Listen, if you go in this building,
that's if she's even still alive,

1577
01:38:28,402 --> 01:38:29,779
there's no way you're gonna
be able to reach her!

1578
01:38:29,879 --> 01:38:31,722
What do you suggest I do?

1579
01:38:32,824 --> 01:38:34,167
It's over.

1580
01:38:36,244 --> 01:38:37,917
I'm sorry, but it's over.

1581
01:38:38,538 --> 01:38:39,664
No.

1582
01:38:39,956 --> 01:38:41,549
Incoming!

1583
01:39:29,046 --> 01:39:31,219
We will kill them all.

1584
01:39:35,887 --> 01:39:38,060
Wreckers, kill him!

1585
01:39:40,224 --> 01:39:41,817
This is going to hurt!

1586
01:39:42,143 --> 01:39:43,941
A lot!

1587
01:39:49,379 --> 01:39:52,178
Your leaders will now understand.

1588
01:39:52,278 --> 01:39:55,578
Decepticons will never
leave your planet alone.

1589
01:39:56,324 --> 01:39:59,498
And we needed them to believe
we had gone.

1590
01:39:59,806 --> 01:40:02,980
For today, in the name of freedom,

1591
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:05,424
we take the battle to them!

1592
01:40:28,189 --> 01:40:30,612
- I saw your ship blow up!
- The ship?

1593
01:40:30,715 --> 01:40:35,221
We were never in the ship!
We designed the damn thing, didn't we?

1594
01:40:35,311 --> 01:40:38,360
We were hidden in the first
booster rocket to separate.

1595
01:40:38,446 --> 01:40:42,076
Splashed down back in the Atlantic,
just as planned.

1596
01:40:42,176 --> 01:40:43,803
We ain't going nowhere.

1597
01:40:43,913 --> 01:40:46,792
Yeah, no one's exiling us.

1598
01:40:48,834 --> 01:40:52,930
The Autobots are staying right here.
We're gonna help you win this war.

1599
01:40:53,147 --> 01:40:56,117
They're surrounding the city
to make a fortress

1600
01:40:56,209 --> 01:40:59,463
so that no one can see
what they're up to inside.

1601
01:40:59,548 --> 01:41:03,098
Our only chance
is the element of surprise.

1602
01:41:03,198 --> 01:41:04,871
I think I know where to look!

1603
01:41:06,852 --> 01:41:09,696
<i>Mini-drone is on approach
to Trump Tower.

1604
01:41:13,150 --> 01:41:15,323
You're telling me Sam's headed into that?

1605
01:41:15,987 --> 01:41:17,079
Poor kid.

1606
01:41:18,489 --> 01:41:20,583
Probably never got close.

1607
01:41:21,075 --> 01:41:22,452
So, you can fly this thing, right?

1608
01:41:23,995 --> 01:41:26,214
What is that... What is that?
What is that? So-so?

1609
01:41:27,206 --> 01:41:29,675
So you so-so can fly this.
That feels terrible.

1610
01:41:31,919 --> 01:41:33,262
We're right behind you.

1611
01:41:40,094 --> 01:41:41,437
All right, we're going in!

1612
01:42:06,724 --> 01:42:09,273
The city is secure.

1613
01:42:09,361 --> 01:42:12,331
The humans cannot stop us.

1614
01:42:12,412 --> 01:42:14,756
As the afternoon falls,

1615
01:42:14,836 --> 01:42:18,136
the rest of the pillars
will reach their launch position.

1616
01:42:18,236 --> 01:42:23,083
This is the victory I promised you
so many years ago,

1617
01:42:23,220 --> 01:42:28,067
where we rebuild Cybertron together!

1618
01:42:28,434 --> 01:42:31,278
I have deigned to work with you

1619
01:42:32,250 --> 01:42:34,799
that our planet may survive!

1620
01:42:34,899 --> 01:42:38,244
I will never work for you!

1621
01:42:38,569 --> 01:42:41,789
You would be wise
to remember the difference.

1622
01:43:03,260 --> 01:43:06,264
I'm so sick of this.
I'm just sick of waiting.

1623
01:43:09,642 --> 01:43:10,768
Where is she?

1624
01:43:11,310 --> 01:43:12,402
Where is she?

1625
01:43:14,146 --> 01:43:15,272
You've got some balls.

1626
01:43:27,451 --> 01:43:28,794
No, Sam!

1627
01:43:30,705 --> 01:43:34,585
No! No, no!

1628
01:43:38,462 --> 01:43:39,714
Carly!

1629
01:43:41,215 --> 01:43:42,262
Carly!

1630
01:43:44,927 --> 01:43:46,304
Jump!

1631
01:44:20,254 --> 01:44:22,256
Bee, fire!

1632
01:44:22,590 --> 01:44:23,967
Bee!

1633
01:44:47,448 --> 01:44:49,792
Autobots! They're alive!

1634
01:44:50,701 --> 01:44:53,705
Decepticons, defend the pillar!

1635
01:44:55,206 --> 01:44:59,552
Raise the bridges! Find them!

1636
01:45:14,558 --> 01:45:15,605
Sam.

1637
01:45:17,545 --> 01:45:18,671
You found me.

1638
01:45:18,771 --> 01:45:20,114
I'd follow you anywhere.

1639
01:45:32,760 --> 01:45:35,229
Form a perimeter!
Let's go, let's go!

1640
01:45:35,329 --> 01:45:36,672
Well, you're crazy.

1641
01:45:38,123 --> 01:45:39,966
What is that? Is that us?

1642
01:45:40,751 --> 01:45:43,880
This thing's a military UAV.
Stone, check and see if it's still working.

1643
01:45:44,067 --> 01:45:45,364
Yeah, it's still got power.

1644
01:45:45,464 --> 01:45:46,841
Flight Control, do you copy?

1645
01:45:47,258 --> 01:45:49,556
Can... Can you rotate?
Can you do something?

1646
01:45:49,902 --> 01:45:51,245
I think we got something.

1647
01:45:51,345 --> 01:45:53,097
Epps! We got Epps!

1648
01:45:54,118 --> 01:45:55,916
<i>Come on, work! Work!

1649
01:45:55,999 --> 01:45:57,519
All right,
turn the volume up on that!

1650
01:45:57,602 --> 01:45:58,728
The kid!

1651
01:45:58,828 --> 01:46:00,956
<i>Can you rotate or something?

1652
01:46:02,043 --> 01:46:04,842
Yes, yes! Okay, okay, okay.
They can see us.

1653
01:46:04,933 --> 01:46:06,686
<i>Chicago is ground zero,
do you understand?

1654
01:46:06,772 --> 01:46:09,195
<i>- Can you hear us? You understand?</i>
- Witwicky.

1655
01:46:09,278 --> 01:46:10,656
<i>Please listen.
Sentinel Prime is here

1656
01:46:10,736 --> 01:46:12,204
<i>and he has the pillars
to his space bridge.

1657
01:46:12,285 --> 01:46:13,787
They're on top of a building
on Chicago River.

1658
01:46:13,867 --> 01:46:15,289
It's owned by Hotchkiss Gould Investments.

1659
01:46:15,389 --> 01:46:18,188
<i>Now, the pillar that controls everything
is in the southeast cupola.

1660
01:46:18,430 --> 01:46:20,649
<i>You've got to destroy the pillar.
You have to shoot down the pillar

1661
01:46:20,711 --> 01:46:23,232
<i>or they're going to transport Cybertron here,
do you understand?

1662
01:46:23,303 --> 01:46:24,600
<i>- Do you understand?</i>
- What?

1663
01:46:24,672 --> 01:46:28,393
Give me a GPS on the building and on that drone!
Let's go!

1664
01:46:28,493 --> 01:46:30,533
Mensurate those coordinates.
Shorten the kill chain.

1665
01:46:30,651 --> 01:46:32,244
Guys on the tarmac, five minutes.

1666
01:46:32,334 --> 01:46:33,381
<i>The southeast cupola.

1667
01:46:33,481 --> 01:46:34,778
All right!

1668
01:46:35,789 --> 01:46:38,292
We need to move
before the fighters spot us.

1669
01:46:38,392 --> 01:46:40,645
Wait here until we scout
a route ahead.

1670
01:46:40,978 --> 01:46:42,821
- Let's roll.
- Ratchet, cover high.

1671
01:46:43,956 --> 01:46:46,675
Hey, think we could use that rocket
to shoot down the pillar?

1672
01:46:46,775 --> 01:46:49,449
We're eight blocks away.
We got to get closer to take a shot.

1673
01:46:49,612 --> 01:46:52,661
Not closer. Higher.
We need a clear line of sight.

1674
01:46:52,823 --> 01:46:55,827
And it's across the river.
Gonna have a hell of a time trying to sneak up.

1675
01:46:56,201 --> 01:46:57,578
We only got one shot.

1676
01:46:58,662 --> 01:47:00,335
One shot's all we need.

1677
01:47:01,185 --> 01:47:03,734
We got to be able to see around that building
from the ground.

1678
01:47:03,822 --> 01:47:06,666
Get NSA to send service specs
for any cameras in that area.

1679
01:47:06,766 --> 01:47:07,813
Maybe some are working.

1680
01:47:08,213 --> 01:47:11,012
Traffic lights. ATMs. Anything.

1681
01:47:11,675 --> 01:47:14,224
Listen up. You want to hit back?

1682
01:47:14,678 --> 01:47:18,558
We're gonna have to wingsuit in.
It's the only way to get close.

1683
01:47:19,099 --> 01:47:22,273
I can't promise anyone a ride home,
but if you're with me,

1684
01:47:22,645 --> 01:47:24,693
the world needs you now.

1685
01:47:25,314 --> 01:47:27,692
I'll find my own ride home, sir.

1686
01:47:30,527 --> 01:47:31,653
Who else?

1687
01:47:34,890 --> 01:47:36,016
General Morshower,

1688
01:47:36,108 --> 01:47:38,611
requesting diversionary action
to the south of the city.

1689
01:47:38,711 --> 01:47:41,071
<i>We're coming north and low.
You guys drive them to the east.

1690
01:47:58,055 --> 01:48:00,274
Autobot victory!
Autobot victory!

1691
01:48:32,690 --> 01:48:35,534
That is one scary-ass Decepticon!

1692
01:48:35,634 --> 01:48:39,639
They got my trailer.
I need that flight tech.

1693
01:48:40,097 --> 01:48:44,273
Shockwave can't hunt all of us at once.
Wreckers,

1694
01:48:44,952 --> 01:48:46,670
we need a diversion.

1695
01:48:46,770 --> 01:48:49,444
- Let's get some!
- You got that right.

1696
01:48:49,797 --> 01:48:52,676
Listen, we're gonna circle around
to that glass building.

1697
01:48:52,776 --> 01:48:54,744
And we'll get high enough
to make the rocket shot

1698
01:48:55,004 --> 01:48:56,347
while you guys draw his fire.

1699
01:48:56,439 --> 01:48:57,941
- Let's move!
- Wait a minute!

1700
01:48:58,024 --> 01:49:01,369
I'm not letting you go out there
without my urban combat prototypes.

1701
01:49:01,469 --> 01:49:03,142
- We got to go, Que!
- Come on.

1702
01:49:03,232 --> 01:49:05,200
They're great inventions for kicking ass!

1703
01:49:05,282 --> 01:49:06,375
What are these?

1704
01:49:06,457 --> 01:49:10,212
Those are boom-sticks.
Armed in 30 seconds.

1705
01:49:10,312 --> 01:49:12,030
Grapple gloves, for climbing.

1706
01:49:12,904 --> 01:49:14,406
Go, go! Move your ass!
Move, move!

1707
01:49:14,506 --> 01:49:17,100
Move, move! Go, go, go!

1708
01:49:22,347 --> 01:49:24,145
- Move, move!
- Let's go!

1709
01:49:36,111 --> 01:49:37,613
Let's go! Run!

1710
01:49:44,514 --> 01:49:46,355
- Hey, hey, hey. Where you going?
- No, no, no!

1711
01:49:46,447 --> 01:49:48,950
- Where you going?
- Stop, stop, stop! Don't leave!

1712
01:49:49,050 --> 01:49:52,896
You never leave a 'bot behind!
Shockwave's coming!

1713
01:49:57,616 --> 01:49:58,742
Go for the stairs!

1714
01:49:58,842 --> 01:50:00,469
Epps, this way!

1715
01:50:01,870 --> 01:50:03,622
<i>Breaking right.

1716
01:50:03,722 --> 01:50:05,065
<i>Bead. Rolling in.

1717
01:50:09,975 --> 01:50:11,296
We got another one coming around.

1718
01:50:11,384 --> 01:50:13,478
Coming around on the left side,
coming around on the right side.

1719
01:50:13,563 --> 01:50:15,941
We're going to use
Willis Tower for cover!

1720
01:50:16,025 --> 01:50:17,902
Once we make altitude, we jump!

1721
01:50:18,002 --> 01:50:20,926
- A lot of airplanes out here!
- Contact off the nose.

1722
01:50:23,042 --> 01:50:24,643
<i>Mayday!
I don't think he's gonna make it.

1723
01:50:24,743 --> 01:50:27,371
<i>- Mayday mayday! Six-one going down.</i>
- Heads up! Heads up!

1724
01:50:31,917 --> 01:50:33,385
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

1725
01:50:42,574 --> 01:50:44,997
<i>- Tally on the left.
- Got him.

1726
01:50:45,085 --> 01:50:47,053
<i>Time on target... 20 seconds.

1727
01:50:47,153 --> 01:50:49,326
Here we go! Here we go!

1728
01:50:49,581 --> 01:50:51,003
Keep it tight!

1729
01:50:51,103 --> 01:50:52,229
<i>Coming around.

1730
01:50:52,437 --> 01:50:54,439
All right, focus, focus, focus.

<i>Threat above towel; Six o'clock!

Get them out, get them out,
get them out!

1737

- Everybody out, out, out!
- Jump, jump, jump!

1738
01:51:23,319 --> 01:51:25,037
Get out, get out!

1739
01:51:25,137 --> 01:51:26,184
I'm stuck!

<i>Now. Get them out now!

01:52:16,063 --> 01:52:18,031
Six hundred feet.

1745

Check your six! Check your six!

1746
01:52:35,249 --> 01:52:38,594
He's on our ass!
Watch out, watch out!

1747
01:52:42,673 --> 01:52:43,720
Sharp right!

1748
01:52:49,346 --> 01:52:50,518
Building dead ahead!

1749
01:52:50,806 --> 01:52:52,149
Thread the needle!

Pull, pull!

1751
01:53:05,788 --> 01:53:08,348
- Come on, we're high enough!
- This is a mother getting up here!

1752
01:53:08,448 --> 01:53:10,246
- Get your fat ass over here!
- I'm coming.

1753
01:53:16,290 --> 01:53:17,963
Set up the rocket!

1754
01:53:18,859 --> 01:53:20,861
- They're coming.
- Weapons status?

1755
01:53:20,961 --> 01:53:23,055
29 Bot-busters, 20 piercing D-Bot.

1756
01:53:25,382 --> 01:53:28,636
There, the building with the dome.

1757
01:53:28,802 --> 01:53:32,306
For our brothers,
let's make this trip worth it.

1758
01:53:35,434 --> 01:53:36,481
Oh, God.

1759
01:53:39,354 --> 01:53:40,856
The building!

1760
01:53:44,901 --> 01:53:46,744
They're shooting at the building!

1761
01:53:50,007 --> 01:53:51,099
This is not a good idea.

1762
01:53:51,191 --> 01:53:52,818
- What?
- This is not a good idea.

1763
01:53:52,902 --> 01:53:54,370
- This building is unstable.
- Listen, stop for a second.

1764
01:53:54,470 --> 01:53:56,518
If we don't do what we came to do,
it doesn't matter, we all die.

1765
01:53:56,621 --> 01:53:58,623
Right? That's your target.
Come on, man!

1766
01:53:58,732 --> 01:54:00,484
I don't even care if the building collapses.

1767
01:54:00,584 --> 01:54:02,086
I'm having a heart attack anyway.

1768
01:54:03,695 --> 01:54:05,322
The building is going over!

1769
01:54:05,422 --> 01:54:06,765
- Hang on!
- Take cover!

1770
01:54:11,219 --> 01:54:13,096
Keep your hands up!

1771
01:54:24,775 --> 01:54:25,947
It's okay! It stopped!

1772
01:54:26,376 --> 01:54:27,844
Guys, look!

1773
01:54:27,944 --> 01:54:30,618
- Incoming, incoming!
- Everybody hide!

1774
01:54:58,767 --> 01:55:01,065
Don't move.

1775
01:55:06,274 --> 01:55:07,491
Go, go.

1776
01:55:14,470 --> 01:55:15,517
Run!

1777
01:55:15,617 --> 01:55:17,164
Cover fire!

1778
01:55:19,496 --> 01:55:22,875
Shoot the glass!
Jump out the window!

1779
01:55:29,339 --> 01:55:30,431
Jump!

1780

Sam, I can't stop!

1782
01:55:53,697 --> 01:55:55,574
Shoot the glass!

1783
01:56:21,224 --> 01:56:22,316
Sam!

1784
01:56:47,768 --> 01:56:50,112
Is everybody okay?

1785
01:56:50,202 --> 01:56:51,249
You okay?

1786
01:56:51,349 --> 01:56:52,692
What the hell was that?

1787
01:56:52,923 --> 01:56:55,893
Driller-bot is thirsty.

1788
01:56:59,262 --> 01:57:01,264
- This evil thing's looking at me!
- What?

1789
01:57:14,252 --> 01:57:16,471
It's even got an uglier Decepticon with it!

1790
01:57:16,571 --> 01:57:17,823
We have to evac!

1791
01:57:36,424 --> 01:57:40,145
- Sergeant Epps, the stairs are blocked!
- We're trapped!

1792
01:57:40,612 --> 01:57:42,831
Okay. How do we get out of here?
Hey! Come on!

1793
01:57:42,931 --> 01:57:45,229
Oh, Lord Jesus,
let me just get out of this alive.

1794
01:57:56,003 --> 01:57:57,721
Move! We got to move!

1795
01:57:57,812 --> 01:57:59,940
Why do the Decepticons
always get the good shit?

1796
01:58:00,040 --> 01:58:01,883
- Move!
- We're about to be eaten, people!

1797
01:58:24,389 --> 01:58:26,187
We're gonna die!

1798
01:58:41,948 --> 01:58:44,292
- Hold on!
- Give me your hand!

1799
01:58:44,434 --> 01:58:45,936
- I'm swinging that way!
- Got her!

1800
01:58:46,026 --> 01:58:47,572
Oh, my God!

1801
01:58:47,672 --> 01:58:50,050
I'm dropping you on the fire escape!

1802
01:59:07,432 --> 01:59:08,479
Sam!

1803
01:59:09,726 --> 01:59:11,603
We gotta move!

1804
01:59:24,824 --> 01:59:27,623
I'm coming for you!

1805
02:00:22,524 --> 02:00:23,867
Optimus!

1806
02:00:23,967 --> 02:00:26,641
- Wreckers!
- We're coming!

1807
02:00:27,786 --> 02:00:30,665
Decepticons around the world,

1808
02:00:30,765 --> 02:00:32,733
launch the pillars.

1809
02:01:03,653 --> 02:01:06,076
We are so lost!

1810
02:01:06,176 --> 02:01:07,519
Always left out.

1811
02:01:08,678 --> 02:01:10,430
Ka-ching!

1812
02:01:12,582 --> 02:01:14,334
It's time to lay down the law.

1813
02:01:14,434 --> 02:01:15,981
About to bring some hurt now.

1814
02:01:23,943 --> 02:01:26,366
It's starting! You see it?

1815
02:01:29,574 --> 02:01:31,247
Look out!

1816
02:01:39,292 --> 02:01:41,135
Where are Sam and Carly?

1817
02:01:43,213 --> 02:01:44,931
We'll go this way.

1818
02:01:51,951 --> 02:01:53,373
I give you one thing to do,

1819
02:01:53,461 --> 02:01:55,429
one thing to do,
and you drop the ball on that?

1820
02:01:55,514 --> 02:01:57,142
I ain't signed up for all this!

1821
02:01:57,222 --> 02:01:59,441
Got aliens blasting at me,
running around, chasing me!

1822
02:01:59,522 --> 02:02:01,775
I'm ducking through churches and buildings
and all that kind of crap!

1823
02:02:01,853 --> 02:02:04,823
This is bullshit!
I ain't signed up for this, Epps.

1824
02:02:04,923 --> 02:02:06,163
I'm trying to keep it together.

1825
02:02:10,281 --> 02:02:13,876
- What a treat! You and me, alone!
- Carly!

1826
02:02:19,249 --> 02:02:20,751
Come on, come on! Run!

1827
02:02:23,169 --> 02:02:25,968
Okay. He's after me, not you.

1828
02:02:26,589 --> 02:02:27,932
Run!

1829
02:02:29,425 --> 02:02:31,848
You can't hide, boy!

1830
02:02:34,747 --> 02:02:39,002
I just love it when your little insect feet
try to run!

1831
02:02:39,102 --> 02:02:40,570
- Sam!
- Run!

1832
02:02:45,859 --> 02:02:48,112
I thought you were working for us, boy?

1833
02:02:52,115 --> 02:02:54,664
No! Sam!

1834
02:03:04,127 --> 02:03:05,754
My eye!

1835
02:03:18,057 --> 02:03:19,604
My eye!

1836
02:03:22,145 --> 02:03:24,773
Target the Decepticon!

1837
02:03:31,821 --> 02:03:33,038
Sam!

1838
02:03:37,977 --> 02:03:39,354
Please, you've got to save Sam!

1839
02:03:39,454 --> 02:03:41,574
- You've got to save him!
- What the hell is he doing?

1840
02:03:44,417 --> 02:03:46,010
This better work.

1841
02:03:46,127 --> 02:03:48,221
D-Bots! D-Bots!

1842
02:04:01,225 --> 02:04:03,728
I can't see! I can't see!

1843
02:04:03,832 --> 02:04:04,879
Sam!

1844
02:04:04,971 --> 02:04:06,848
It's on my hand! Grab the knife!
Knife!

1845
02:04:06,948 --> 02:04:08,245
- I'm trying!
- Knife, knife, knife, knife, knife!

1846
02:04:08,707 --> 02:04:12,428
The bomb's gonna blow!
The bomb's gonna...

1847
02:04:12,516 --> 02:04:14,484
You human scum!

1848
02:04:14,568 --> 02:04:16,491
- We got 20 seconds on that bomb!
- What bomb?

1849
02:04:16,591 --> 02:04:17,638
You see that bomb?

1850
02:04:17,951 --> 02:04:20,124
- Cut it, cut it, cut it!
- I got it!

1851
02:04:20,244 --> 02:04:22,087
How long do we have?

1852
02:04:22,872 --> 02:04:25,671
I'm gonna kick you!

1853
02:04:34,217 --> 02:04:35,639
Cut, cut, cut!

1854
02:04:37,095 --> 02:04:39,223
I'm gonna kill...

1855
02:04:56,072 --> 02:04:58,040
Well, he's dead.

1856
02:05:00,218 --> 02:05:02,562
Hey, Bee's going to run
with the rest of the Autobots

1857
02:05:02,662 --> 02:05:04,702
- and meet us at the edge of the river.
- All right.

1858
02:05:32,567 --> 02:05:35,616
It sucked me in!
There was nothing I could do!

1859
02:05:37,321 --> 02:05:38,948
This is a total cluster...

1860
02:05:39,598 --> 02:05:42,101
We got to get across the river.

1861
02:05:42,177 --> 02:05:43,877
You see that?
She said the control pillar was in that first cupola.

1862
02:05:43,977 --> 02:05:44,733
All right.

1863
02:05:45,705 --> 02:05:48,299
Let's go! Move! Let's move!

1864
02:05:48,833 --> 02:05:50,881
<i>Tomahawks are inbound.

1865
02:05:52,107 --> 02:05:53,529
<i>ETA: 20 minutes.

1866
02:05:53,629 --> 02:05:55,302
I'm in the traffic cameras.

1867
02:05:56,132 --> 02:05:58,180
<i>Four Autobots are captured.

1868
02:05:58,384 --> 02:06:00,307
Oh, my God. We're helpless.

1869
02:06:00,445 --> 02:06:03,164
Whatever's set to happen,
with those pulses getting faster,

1870
02:06:03,264 --> 02:06:04,481
it's gonna happen soon.

1871
02:06:05,141 --> 02:06:06,768
<i>No sign of Optimus.

1872
02:06:07,643 --> 02:06:10,066
How do we get these bridges down?

1873
02:06:10,855 --> 02:06:13,108
Spread out. Check in there.

1874
02:06:16,006 --> 02:06:18,054
Epps, I've been looking for your ass.
How you doing?

1875
02:06:18,142 --> 02:06:20,736
Retirement is wack. Even worse,

1876
02:06:20,821 --> 02:06:22,573
we can't get across the river
to that building,

1877
02:06:22,673 --> 02:06:24,596
and the Autobots are upstairs, surrounded.

1878
02:06:30,715 --> 02:06:32,235
Just pan the camera around, all right?

1879
02:06:32,335 --> 02:06:34,258
All right. Pan... Pan right.
That's you.

1880
02:06:35,338 --> 02:06:37,466
Try getting into the bridge control room.

1881
02:06:39,488 --> 02:06:41,661
What are they doing?
They're just standing there.

1882
02:06:41,761 --> 02:06:45,686
Hang on. Dutch, see if you
can hack into the bridge.

1883
02:06:46,532 --> 02:06:48,626
Sir, SEALS are here.

1884
02:06:48,714 --> 02:06:50,557
It's a good day, boys!
What do you got?

1885
02:06:50,642 --> 02:06:52,770
Got a 10-man SEAL unit, sir,
tasked with vectoring Tomahawks.

1886
02:06:52,870 --> 02:06:53,871
- How long?
- Fifteen.

1887
02:06:54,065 --> 02:06:57,740
- You're my prisoners!
- Take it easy. We surrender.

1888
02:06:58,528 --> 02:06:59,871
Get off me.

1889
02:07:00,530 --> 02:07:02,203
Get off me!

1890
02:07:02,636 --> 02:07:05,476
All right, you're gonna need your 40 Mike-Mikes and frags.
Go full auto.

1891
02:07:05,567 --> 02:07:09,447
The vibrations jack up their circuits.
Snipers, shoot for the eyes.

1892
02:07:09,547 --> 02:07:12,221
All right, your target is up on top
of that building, that cupola.

1893
02:07:12,525 --> 02:07:15,278
How doomed you are, Autobots.

1894
02:07:15,368 --> 02:07:17,791
You simply fail to understand

1895
02:07:17,891 --> 02:07:22,237
that the needs of the many
outweigh the needs of the few.

1896
02:07:22,510 --> 02:07:25,059
Activating the bridge.

1897
02:07:36,566 --> 02:07:38,409
They happy about something.

1898
02:07:38,759 --> 02:07:40,636
We're in the heart of their ship.

1899
02:07:40,724 --> 02:07:42,692
Let's give 'em a little ride.

1900
02:07:42,792 --> 02:07:45,136
We gonna screw this ship up.

1901
02:07:45,491 --> 02:07:47,914
It's a 128K binary encryption code.

1902
02:07:49,245 --> 02:07:50,918
It's difficult.

1903
02:07:51,497 --> 02:07:54,501
But not for me. I'm in.
Bridge down.

1904
02:07:56,002 --> 02:07:58,425
The bridge is coming down!
Someone's watching over us!

1905
02:07:59,046 --> 02:08:00,593
Come on! Let's go!

1906
02:08:00,781 --> 02:08:03,284
"Pleasure working with you, Seymour."

1907
02:08:03,384 --> 02:08:05,102
I believe you're supposed to say.

1908
02:08:05,928 --> 02:08:07,430
Good job, Dutch.

1909
02:08:14,270 --> 02:08:15,863
Get off me!

1910
02:08:40,671 --> 02:08:43,265
Hurry!
They're triggering the pillars!

1911
02:08:44,508 --> 02:08:46,681
Prisoners?
You're keeping prisoners?

1912
02:08:47,011 --> 02:08:48,979
Yes.

1913
02:08:49,180 --> 02:08:50,807
You need to teach them about respect.

1914
02:08:51,140 --> 02:08:53,781
This was all business, but now it's personal,
do you understand me?

1915
02:08:54,977 --> 02:08:59,983
I understand.
No prisoners, only trophies.

1916
02:09:00,816 --> 02:09:04,446
Bee, I think they're going to kill us.

1917
02:09:05,470 --> 02:09:08,724
- You, your time is up.
- Wait, wait, wait!

1918
02:09:08,814 --> 02:09:11,112
We surrendered!
We're your prisoners.

1919
02:09:11,195 --> 02:09:13,414
- Move it!
- Can't we talk this out?

1920
02:09:13,514 --> 02:09:17,144
We're all a bunch of good chaps!
I mean you no...

1921
02:09:19,835 --> 02:09:21,883
Why did you...

1922
02:09:28,970 --> 02:09:30,972
Good-bye, my old friend.

1923
02:09:32,181 --> 02:09:34,024
You're mine now.

1924
02:09:47,530 --> 02:09:48,873
Get off me!

1925
02:09:49,532 --> 02:09:51,000
- I got to help him.
- What?

1926
02:09:51,801 --> 02:09:53,269
What are you doing?

1927
02:09:53,369 --> 02:09:55,872
- I got to help him.
- Sam, you can't help him.

1928
02:10:03,879 --> 02:10:06,132
Turn around.

1929
02:10:15,057 --> 02:10:17,651
We... We gave 'em a hell of a run.

1930
02:10:33,559 --> 02:10:35,186
We did it, Brains! We did it!

1931
02:10:35,286 --> 02:10:36,833
Rip this ship apart!

1932
02:11:15,451 --> 02:11:18,079
- We had a nice run, Brains, you and me.
- Yeah, we gonna die.

1933
02:11:34,762 --> 02:11:37,481
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Okay, baby!
You all come with us!

1934
02:11:38,116 --> 02:11:40,835
Go!
You guys, follow that ground team! Go!

1935
02:11:40,935 --> 02:11:44,189
- Move, move, move!
- Epps, third floor! We're going to 45!

1936
02:11:49,819 --> 02:11:51,446
All right.
Two snipers, right here!

1937
02:11:53,489 --> 02:11:54,490
All right, dock up!

1938
02:11:56,117 --> 02:11:57,994
We jump in three minutes!

1939
02:12:01,080 --> 02:12:03,003
Set up shop right here.

1940
02:12:07,586 --> 02:12:08,712
Setup.

1941
02:12:10,614 --> 02:12:11,991
I'm downstairs.

1942
02:12:12,091 --> 02:12:14,685
We got five targets and
Shockwave right below us.

1943
02:12:14,910 --> 02:12:16,662
<i>Stand by to jump!

1944
02:12:16,762 --> 02:12:19,106
All right, let's go!
Get ready, get ready.

1945
02:12:32,403 --> 02:12:34,030
Go!

1946
02:12:43,873 --> 02:12:45,625
Snipers, take out their eyes.

1947
02:12:49,378 --> 02:12:50,979
All right, demo team,
let's crank steel.

1948
02:12:59,096 --> 02:13:01,144
Turning steel!

1949
02:13:37,259 --> 02:13:38,681
Don't fire till I tell you!

1950
02:13:49,522 --> 02:13:50,944
Go!

1951
02:13:52,796 --> 02:13:54,343
Good job, kid!

1952
02:13:54,443 --> 02:13:55,490
Fire!

1953
02:14:07,748 --> 02:14:09,295
- We got him!
- Yeah!

1954
02:14:10,459 --> 02:14:12,086
He's on the run!

1955
02:14:14,421 --> 02:14:16,515
Autobots, attack!

1956
02:14:21,804 --> 02:14:23,772
Mortar that bridge!

1957
02:14:27,434 --> 02:14:29,778
It's our world now!

1958
02:14:30,646 --> 02:14:32,648
Commence transport!

1959
02:14:44,660 --> 02:14:47,288
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1960
02:15:01,927 --> 02:15:03,270
Optimus!

1961
02:15:38,213 --> 02:15:40,215
You die!

1962
02:15:48,223 --> 02:15:49,520
No!

1963
02:16:00,090 --> 02:16:02,388
Get down here, Sentinel!

1964
02:16:02,488 --> 02:16:06,580
Optimus, you forget your place!

1965
02:16:13,415 --> 02:16:17,090
I bring you
Cybertron, your home,

1966
02:16:17,899 --> 02:16:21,073
and still you choose humanity.

1967
02:16:21,173 --> 02:16:25,098
You were the one who taught me
freedom is everyone's right.

1968
02:16:28,580 --> 02:16:30,833
I will retrigger that pillar!

1969
02:16:30,933 --> 02:16:34,028
Then you'll have
to go through me!

1970
02:16:38,006 --> 02:16:39,508
Okay, I've got to try and help.

1971
02:16:39,598 --> 02:16:41,521
- I have to. You stay here.
- Don't you go. Don't go.

1972
02:16:41,621 --> 02:16:45,000
You'll be fine, okay? I promise.
I got to get to that pillar.

1973
02:16:47,216 --> 02:16:49,059
Charge the pillar!

1974
02:16:49,159 --> 02:16:50,502
We got Autobots!

1975
02:17:07,779 --> 02:17:09,747
Reinforcements!

1976
02:17:09,847 --> 02:17:12,691
Decepticon ships,
fire at Optimus!

1977
02:17:17,229 --> 02:17:19,903
We're taking fire! I need
those Tomahawks now!

1978
02:17:20,149 --> 02:17:21,776
First wave inbound.

1979
02:17:27,906 --> 02:17:30,534
We've got to cover for Optimus!

1980
02:17:44,673 --> 02:17:47,847
Decepticons, trigger the pillar!

1981
02:17:48,552 --> 02:17:50,554
Restart that pillar!

1982
02:17:51,013 --> 02:17:52,435
Trigger the pillars.

1983
02:17:53,307 --> 02:17:57,562
I can't hold them! The
ships have us pinned!

1984
02:17:58,270 --> 02:17:59,692
No!

1985
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,549
Inbound, 10 seconds!
Danger close!

1986
02:18:02,639 --> 02:18:04,937
Mark-Lima-Echo-Echo, 14250!

1987
02:18:05,023 --> 02:18:06,275
Positive surface contact.

1988
02:18:06,375 --> 02:18:07,877
<i>- Target I.D.</i>
- Target acquired.

1989
02:18:36,433 --> 02:18:39,027
- Dylan! Wait!
- No!

1990
02:18:42,022 --> 02:18:43,069
Dylan!

1991
02:18:44,149 --> 02:18:45,571
Stop! Stop!

1992
02:18:45,901 --> 02:18:47,153
No!

1993
02:18:47,736 --> 02:18:49,659
You can't do this, okay?

1994
02:18:50,280 --> 02:18:52,248
There's only one future for me.

1995
02:19:16,181 --> 02:19:22,530
Cybertron, you are
saved, at last.

1996
02:19:31,530 --> 02:19:34,659
Have you come to surrender?

1997
02:19:35,055 --> 02:19:37,478
- Was it all worth it?
- Obviously.

1998
02:19:37,578 --> 02:19:41,628
All your work to bring Sentinel back
and now clearly he has all the power.

1999
02:19:41,978 --> 02:19:43,776
It's actually almost tragic.

2000
02:19:43,867 --> 02:19:46,996
You dare lecture me, slave?

2001
02:19:47,079 --> 02:19:49,673
Your Decepticons finally
conquering this planet,

2002
02:19:49,724 --> 02:19:51,124
and yet,
their leader won't be you!

2003
02:19:51,224 --> 02:19:55,570
It will be me!
It will always be me.

2004
02:19:56,571 --> 02:19:58,665
In any minute now,

2005
02:19:58,765 --> 02:20:02,611
you'll be nothing but Sentinel's bitch.

2006
02:20:09,776 --> 02:20:11,449
Rocket!

2007
02:20:12,905 --> 02:20:14,122
Die!

2008
02:20:26,668 --> 02:20:28,011
You chose sides?

2009
02:20:29,129 --> 02:20:30,176
You chose wrong.

2010
02:20:36,345 --> 02:20:39,189
Always the bravest of us!

2011
02:20:42,184 --> 02:20:44,733
But you could never make
the hard decisions!

2012
02:20:47,773 --> 02:20:50,822
Our planet will survive!

2013
02:20:51,777 --> 02:20:52,994
No!

2014
02:21:02,871 --> 02:21:05,920
We were gods once. All of us.

2015
02:21:06,018 --> 02:21:08,362
- But here...
- Please!

2016
02:21:08,462 --> 02:21:10,885
There will only be one!

2017
02:21:21,807 --> 02:21:25,528
This is my planet!

2018
02:21:36,238 --> 02:21:38,206
I just saved a whole other world.

2019
02:21:38,407 --> 02:21:41,251
You think you're a hero, huh?
You think you're a hero?

2020
02:21:41,576 --> 02:21:44,045
No. I'm just a messenger.

2021
02:21:51,420 --> 02:21:53,138
The pillar's still connected!

2022
02:21:55,048 --> 02:21:56,470
Bring it up!

2023
02:21:56,733 --> 02:21:58,952
- Bee! Let's do this!
- Let's go, let's go! Move, move!

2024
02:21:59,044 --> 02:22:00,671
Pillar's still connected!

2025
02:22:00,771 --> 02:22:03,024
Rip that pillar down!

2026
02:22:26,270 --> 02:22:30,025
Now, we need a truce.

2027
02:22:30,114 --> 02:22:33,539
All I want is to
be back in charge.

2028
02:22:33,621 --> 02:22:35,715
Besides,

2029
02:22:35,796 --> 02:22:39,596
who would you be without me, Prime?

2030
02:22:39,696 --> 02:22:42,119
Time to find out.

2031
02:23:04,600 --> 02:23:07,729
Optimus, all I ever wanted

2032
02:23:07,829 --> 02:23:10,332
was the survival of our race.

2033
02:23:10,724 --> 02:23:15,070
You must see why
I had to betray you.

2034
02:23:15,170 --> 02:23:17,514
You didn't betray me.

2035
02:23:18,006 --> 02:23:20,350
You betrayed yourself.

2036
02:23:20,675 --> 02:23:22,222
No, Optimus!

2037
02:24:18,400 --> 02:24:19,993
Sam.

2038
02:24:59,274 --> 02:25:02,118
I love you.

2039
02:25:03,041 --> 02:25:04,721
You're the only thing
I need in this world,

2040
02:25:04,821 --> 02:25:07,449
and I'll do anything to make it up to you,
I promise.

2041
02:25:08,057 --> 02:25:10,685
I'm going to hold you to that.

2042
02:25:10,785 --> 02:25:12,287
Just never let me go.

2043
02:25:13,205 --> 02:25:14,832
I promise.

2044
02:25:20,128 --> 02:25:21,596
Rings.

2045
02:25:29,387 --> 02:25:30,980
I love this car.

2046
02:25:31,264 --> 02:25:35,064
Bee, you've got to slow it clown.
You got to slow way down, okay?

2047
02:25:35,936 --> 02:25:37,188
I'm just trying to help out.

2048
02:25:39,314 --> 02:25:44,111
<i>In any war
there are calms between storms.

2049
02:25:44,795 --> 02:25:46,012
You fought bravely.

2050
02:25:46,104 --> 02:25:48,732
<i>There will be days when we lose faith.

2051
02:25:48,832 --> 02:25:51,676
<i>Days when our allies turn against us.

2052
02:25:52,327 --> 02:25:56,753
<i>But the day will never come
that we forsake this planet

2053
02:25:56,998 --> 02:25:59,501
<i>and its people.

2054
02:26:20,814 --> 02:26:25,035
That's what I call the start
of a beautiful future.

2055
02:26:26,194 --> 02:26:28,162
Arrest him.

2056
02:26:28,300 --> 02:26:29,347
It was worth it!

2057
02:26:29,447 --> 02:26:31,541
- Get him out of here!
- I'd go to jail for love! I don't care!

2058
02:26:31,724 --> 02:26:34,603
Go ahead, take me in! I want to go in!
Let's go in.

2059
02:26:34,703 --> 02:26:36,546
Come on, Charlotte,
take me in right now!
