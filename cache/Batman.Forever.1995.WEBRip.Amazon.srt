He's holding innocent people

No. He'll slaughter them

welcome to the Greatest

553
00:33:31,792 --> 00:33:34,795
Bruce, who is this
beautiful young woman
you're with?

554
00:33:34,838 --> 00:33:36,536
Dr Chase Meridian.

555
00:33:36,579 --> 00:33:39,321
A doctor?
What kind of doctor?

unimaginable aerial skill,

562
00:33:58,166 --> 00:34:00,603
the flying Graysons!

563
00:34:54,396 --> 00:34:56,833
Listen, I'm going
rock climbing
this weekend.

564
00:34:56,877 --> 00:34:58,661
Would you
like to join me?

565
00:34:58,705 --> 00:35:00,272
Oh, um...

566
00:35:00,315 --> 00:35:02,796
I'd like to.
I--I--I love climbing.

567
00:35:02,839 --> 00:35:05,059
I mean,
I really love it.

568
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,669
But?

569
00:35:06,713 --> 00:35:08,323
I've met someone.

570
00:35:08,367 --> 00:35:12,153
That's fast work.
You just moved here.

571
00:35:12,197 --> 00:35:14,460
Well, you could say
he just kind of

572
00:35:14,503 --> 00:35:18,116
dropped out of the sky,
and...bang.

573
00:35:19,421 --> 00:35:21,510
I think he felt it,
too.

574
00:35:21,554 --> 00:35:23,208
Sure did.

575
00:35:23,251 --> 00:35:24,339
What?

576
00:35:25,819 --> 00:35:27,081
Well, who wouldn't?

577
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,475
And now...

578
00:35:31,085 --> 00:35:34,828
Richard, the youngest
flying Grayson,

579
00:35:34,871 --> 00:35:39,137
will perform the
awe-inspiring death drop.

582
00:36:02,943 --> 00:36:04,336
Okay. Let's go.

583
00:36:04,379 --> 00:36:06,294
You'll
be all right?

584
00:36:24,138 --> 00:36:25,879
[Cheers and applause]

Ladies and gentlemen!

The new management

invites you to forget
this good clean wholesome
all-American fun

588
00:36:51,513 --> 00:36:53,298
and join us
in a celebration

589
00:36:53,341 --> 00:36:56,953

and true justice!

590
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,219

 <i>Tonight, a new act for</i>

00:37:14,188 --> 00:37:18,714
We call it massacre

594
00:37:18,758 --> 00:37:19,846
Ha ha ha!

00:37:19,889 --> 00:37:21,717
If we may
direct your attention

596
00:37:21,761 --> 00:37:23,719
to the middle
of the center ring.

597
00:37:23,763 --> 00:37:26,156
Inside this
harmless-looking orb

598
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:30,987
are 2--that's 2--
hundred sticks of TNT,

599
00:37:31,031 --> 00:37:33,338
and in our innocent hand,

600
00:37:33,381 --> 00:37:35,905
a radio detonator.

601
00:37:35,949 --> 00:37:37,907
What the hell
do you want?

602
00:37:37,951 --> 00:37:39,779
Want, Mr. Mayor?

603
00:37:39,822 --> 00:37:42,956
One simple thing--Batman,
bruised, broken, bleeding.

604
00:37:42,999 --> 00:37:44,305
In a word--

605
00:37:44,349 --> 00:37:45,741
dead!

606
00:37:45,785 --> 00:37:49,310
Ah ha ha ha ha ha
ha ha ha ha ha!

607
00:37:49,354 --> 00:37:51,486
Batman?

608
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:53,749
Who do we have
before us?

609
00:37:53,793 --> 00:37:55,708
Gotham's finest--

610
00:37:55,751 --> 00:37:57,927
well-to-do, influential.

611
00:37:57,971 --> 00:38:00,452
Surely one of you knows
who Batman is.

612
00:38:00,495 --> 00:38:05,021
Hell, odds are one of you
pasty-faced twits is Batman!

613

Ha ha! Ha ha ha!

618
00:38:36,401 --> 00:38:38,968
We could stop him.
Go out on the rigging.

619
00:38:39,012 --> 00:38:40,883
Be careful,
boys.
Don't worry, mom.

620
00:38:59,075 --> 00:39:01,643
Go to work,
boys! Ha ha!

621
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,708
Ha!

622
00:39:22,751 --> 00:39:24,840
Our kind of day!

623
00:39:32,979 --> 00:39:35,155
Reach for it! Stop it!

624
00:39:41,422 --> 00:39:43,598
Oh, my God.

00:39:43,642 --> 00:39:46,296
Aah!
Aah!

00:39:54,479 --> 00:39:56,045
Ha ha!

[Gasp]

628
00:41:21,783 --> 00:41:24,438
Bruce, good of you
to take him in.

629
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,309
He hasn't anyone now.

630
00:41:26,353 --> 00:41:28,355
We've had him
filling out papers
all day.

631
00:41:28,398 --> 00:41:30,488
He hasn't slept.
He hasn't even eaten.

632
00:41:41,803 --> 00:41:43,588
Welcome, Master Grayson.

633
00:41:43,631 --> 00:41:44,937
I'm Alfred.

634
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,721
How you doing, Al?

635
00:41:48,201 --> 00:41:50,333
There's a room prepared
for you upstairs.

636
00:41:50,377 --> 00:41:52,771
Perhaps you'd like
something to eat first.

637
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:57,079
Okay. I'm out of here.

638
00:41:58,472 --> 00:42:00,039
Excuse me?

639
00:42:00,082 --> 00:42:02,171
Telling that cop
I'd stay here

640
00:42:02,215 --> 00:42:04,957
saved me a truckload
of social service interviews
and charities,

641
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,569
so, uh, no offence,
but no, thanks. See you.

642
00:42:08,613 --> 00:42:10,615
Take it easy, Al.

643
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:22,888
Where will you go?

644
00:42:22,931 --> 00:42:26,152
The circus
must be halfway to
Metropolis by now.

645
00:42:26,195 --> 00:42:29,459
Get a fix on Two-Face,
then I'll kill him.

646
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:32,288
Killing Two-Face won't
take the pain away.

647
00:42:32,332 --> 00:42:34,377
It'll make it worse.

648
00:42:34,421 --> 00:42:37,076
Look, spare me the sermon,
all right, Bruce?

649
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:40,906
I don't need your advice
or your charity.

650
00:42:40,949 --> 00:42:42,647
Nice bike.

651
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:44,997
Hang out at a lot
of biker bars?

652
00:42:47,347 --> 00:42:50,611
You're almost on empty.
Why don't you fill it up
in the garage?

653
00:42:50,655 --> 00:42:52,918
There's
not a gas station
around for miles.

654
00:43:01,013 --> 00:43:02,971
Pump's over here.

655
00:43:03,015 --> 00:43:05,974
Is this a garage
or a car museum,
Bruce?

656
00:43:08,673 --> 00:43:10,196
Wow.

657
00:43:14,026 --> 00:43:16,071
It's a 1917 Harley.

658
00:43:16,115 --> 00:43:17,246
Yep.

659
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:20,554
Indian classic.
Fully restored.

660
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:23,209
This is a Vincent
Black Knight.

661
00:43:23,252 --> 00:43:25,254
They only made like
a hundred of these.

662
00:43:25,298 --> 00:43:28,040
101, actually.
She's my favorite.

663
00:43:28,083 --> 00:43:30,085
You've got
two of them.

664
00:43:30,129 --> 00:43:32,435
Yeah. That one
doesn't run, though.

665
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:34,699
Throttle
sticks on this one.

666
00:43:34,742 --> 00:43:37,179
Alfred's actually
a very good mechanic,

667
00:43:37,223 --> 00:43:40,052
but some of these
need a lot of work.

668
00:43:40,095 --> 00:43:41,836
Someone
were to fix them up,

669
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:45,623
they could
keep one as a fee.

670
00:43:45,666 --> 00:43:47,668
Anyway, have a nice trip.

671
00:43:49,061 --> 00:43:51,106
I'm sure you'll
land on your feet.

672
00:43:53,979 --> 00:43:56,111
Is the young master
leaving?

673
00:43:56,155 --> 00:43:57,765
Pity.

674
00:43:57,809 --> 00:43:59,941
I'll just toss this
away, then.

675
00:43:59,985 --> 00:44:02,291
Perhaps
the dogs are hungry.

676
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:07,514
Hey, Al, wait up.

Master Bruce.

Just like my parents.

out of the night.

688

A scream, two shots.

689
00:46:17,905 --> 00:46:20,212
I killed them.

690
00:46:20,255 --> 00:46:21,866
What did you say?

691
00:46:21,909 --> 00:46:23,476
He killed them.

Two-Face.

693
00:46:24,999 --> 00:46:27,393

No. No, you said "I."

695
00:46:30,309 --> 00:46:32,267
"I killed them."

697
00:46:42,756 --> 00:46:45,106

700
00:46:58,293 --> 00:46:59,773
No.

701
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:02,254
Thanks. I won't
be staying long.

702
00:47:02,297 --> 00:47:04,734
Oh.

703
00:47:04,778 --> 00:47:06,693
Is this a robin?

704
00:47:09,957 --> 00:47:12,394
My brother's wire
broke once.

705
00:47:12,438 --> 00:47:15,006
I, uh, swung out
and grabbed him.

706
00:47:15,049 --> 00:47:17,835
My father said
I was his hero.

707
00:47:17,878 --> 00:47:20,576
I flew in
like a robin.

708
00:47:22,622 --> 00:47:26,017
Some hero
I turned out to be.

709
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:28,671
Ah, but your father
was right.

710
00:47:28,715 --> 00:47:31,283
You are a hero,
I can tell.

711
00:47:37,637 --> 00:47:39,813
Throw this away,
will you, Alfred?

712
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:42,163
I won't be
needing it anymore.

713
00:47:44,165 --> 00:47:47,429
I think I'll just
put it in here.

714

mend in time.

1084
01:11:04,172 --> 01:11:06,392
Edward,
how does it feel
to be the city's

1085
01:11:06,436 --> 01:11:08,525
newest, most
eligible bachelor?

1086
01:11:08,568 --> 01:11:11,092
Gotham must know!

1087
01:11:11,136 --> 01:11:14,313
Oh! There's Bruce Wayne!

1088
01:11:14,357 --> 01:11:15,532
Brucie!

1089
01:11:15,575 --> 01:11:17,055
Over here!Bruce Wayne!

1090
01:11:17,098 --> 01:11:20,232
Oh, Eddie,
he is too cute.

1091
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:23,104
How come you
don't look so good
in that suit?

1092
01:11:23,148 --> 01:11:25,890
Shut up.
You're here to work.

1093
01:11:25,933 --> 01:11:27,587
How's my mole?Fine.

1094
01:11:27,631 --> 01:11:29,894
Mr. Wayne.
What about rumors

1095
01:11:29,937 --> 01:11:32,113
of a Nygma Tech take-over
of Wayne Enterprises?

1096
01:11:32,157 --> 01:11:35,291
Nygma Tech stock
is outselling Wayne
Enterprises 2 to 1.

1097
01:11:35,334 --> 01:11:37,728
Are you yesterday's
news, Bruce?

1098
01:11:37,771 --> 01:11:39,469
Yes, yes, yes!

1099
01:11:39,512 --> 01:11:41,035
Bruce, old man.

1100
01:11:41,079 --> 01:11:42,733
The press
were just wondering

1101
01:11:42,776 --> 01:11:44,952
what it feels like
to be outsold, outclassed,

1102
01:11:44,996 --> 01:11:47,303
outcoifed, and...

1103
01:11:47,346 --> 01:11:50,044
generally outdone
in every way.

1104
01:11:50,088 --> 01:11:52,177
Hello, Edward.
Congratulations.

1105
01:11:52,220 --> 01:11:53,570
Great party.

1106
01:11:53,613 --> 01:11:54,658
Nice suit.

1107
01:11:54,701 --> 01:11:56,660
Oh. Wit. Good.

1108
01:11:57,965 --> 01:11:59,358
And you are?

1109
01:11:59,402 --> 01:12:00,446
Chase.

1110
01:12:02,013 --> 01:12:04,450
And what a grand pursuit
you must be.

1111
01:12:07,758 --> 01:12:09,325
I'm Bruce Wayne, Miss...

1112
01:12:09,368 --> 01:12:11,239
Oh. Ha ha.

1113
01:12:11,283 --> 01:12:13,720
You can call me
anything you want.

1114
01:12:15,069 --> 01:12:17,289
Ladies and gentlemen...

1115
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:18,943
the future!

1116
01:12:18,986 --> 01:12:22,207
My new, improved box
offers fully interactive

1117
01:12:22,250 --> 01:12:24,557
holographic
fantasies.

1118
01:12:29,432 --> 01:12:30,433
[Fanfare]

1119
01:12:30,476 --> 01:12:31,999
[Woman]
Oh!

1120
01:12:35,873 --> 01:12:37,440
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!

1121
01:12:37,483 --> 01:12:40,225
[Applause]

1122
01:12:40,268 --> 01:12:41,487
Oh!
Oh!

1123
01:12:41,531 --> 01:12:44,011
[Applause]

1124
01:12:44,055 --> 01:12:47,624
Edward, you're dashing
and a genius.

1125
01:12:47,667 --> 01:12:50,714
How do you create
these images, Hon?

1126
01:12:50,757 --> 01:12:53,369
That, my dear, is
my little secret.

1127
01:12:54,587 --> 01:12:56,589
Oh!
Oh!Oh!

1128
01:12:56,633 --> 01:12:58,504

[Applause]

1129
01:13:00,637 --> 01:13:03,074
Fully interactive
holographs.

1130
01:13:03,117 --> 01:13:04,902
Only a high frequency
carrier wave

1131
01:13:04,945 --> 01:13:06,904
beamed directly
into the brain

1132
01:13:06,947 --> 01:13:08,645
could create
such images.

1133
01:13:08,688 --> 01:13:11,212
Yeah, and you wish
you thought of it.

1134
01:13:11,256 --> 01:13:13,258
Don't be
a sore loser.

1135
01:13:13,301 --> 01:13:15,521
Step inside.
Give it a try.

1136
01:13:15,565 --> 01:13:17,741
Edward...

1137
01:13:17,784 --> 01:13:20,221
if you can introduce
images into the mind,

1138
01:13:20,265 --> 01:13:23,747
what prevents you
from extracting images
out of the mind?

1139
01:13:23,790 --> 01:13:26,010
Ohhh...

1140
01:13:26,053 --> 01:13:29,230
too timid to try
my machine?
Just say so.

1141
01:13:30,928 --> 01:13:33,452
Shall we dance?

1142
01:13:54,517 --> 01:13:57,215
Naughty, naughty.

1143
01:13:57,258 --> 01:13:58,956
Looking
for something?

1144
01:13:58,999 --> 01:14:01,698
I was just--
just wondering
how you turn it off.

1145
01:14:03,526 --> 01:14:05,484
Ah.

1146
01:14:05,528 --> 01:14:07,312
Clever.

1147
01:14:07,355 --> 01:14:10,228
Thanks.
My pleasure.

1148
01:14:39,213 --> 01:14:40,998
 <i>Good evening, Mr. Wayne.</i>

1149
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:45,002
 <i>Relax.</i>

1150
01:14:45,045 --> 01:14:47,178
 <i>Tell me...</i>

1151
01:14:47,221 --> 01:14:49,485
 <i>your dreams.</i>

1152
01:14:50,964 --> 01:14:52,836
 <i>Tell me...</i>

1153
01:14:52,879 --> 01:14:56,317
 <i>your fantasies.</i>

1154
01:14:56,361 --> 01:14:59,146
 <i>Tell me your secrets.</i>

1155
01:15:01,061 --> 01:15:03,716
 <i>Tell me...</i>

1156
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:05,631
 <i>your deepest...</i>

1157
01:15:05,675 --> 01:15:07,241
 <i>darkest...</i>

 <i>fears.</i>

1159
01:15:25,085 --> 01:15:27,523
No! No! No! No!

1160
01:15:31,048 --> 01:15:32,745
[Crowd shouting]

1161
01:15:35,052 --> 01:15:36,053
Ha ha!

1162
01:15:36,096 --> 01:15:37,315
[Blows into gun]

1163
01:15:38,795 --> 01:15:40,666
[Two-Face]
Relax, folks!

1164
01:15:40,710 --> 01:15:44,104
It's only an old-fashioned,
low-tech stickup!

1165
01:15:44,148 --> 01:15:46,324
We're interested
in the basics--

1166
01:15:46,367 --> 01:15:49,370
cash, jewellery,
cellular telephones.

1167
01:15:49,414 --> 01:15:51,503
Hand them over
nice and quietly,

1168
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:53,549
and no one
will be hurt!

1169
01:15:58,641 --> 01:16:01,078
Emergency, Alfred.

1170
01:16:01,121 --> 01:16:02,558
Yes, sir.

1171
01:16:04,037 --> 01:16:07,693
Be calm, everybody!
Just be calm!

1172
01:16:07,737 --> 01:16:09,565
Excuse me.

1173
01:16:09,608 --> 01:16:12,089
[Screaming
and shouting]

1174
01:16:12,132 --> 01:16:13,830
You're ruining
my big party!

1175
01:16:13,873 --> 01:16:16,093
Are you insane?

1176
01:16:16,136 --> 01:16:19,183
We're sick of waiting
for you to deliver
the Batman, dear boy.

1177
01:16:19,226 --> 01:16:21,228
Patience,
o bifurcated one.

1178
01:16:21,272 --> 01:16:23,230
Patience, hell!
We want him dead!

1179
01:16:23,274 --> 01:16:25,232
And nothing brings
out the Batman

1180
01:16:25,276 --> 01:16:27,408
like a little
murder and mayhem, baby.

1181
01:16:27,452 --> 01:16:29,933
At least you could've
let me in on the caper.

1182
01:16:29,976 --> 01:16:32,196
We could've
organized this,
planned it...

1183
01:16:32,239 --> 01:16:34,198
presold
the movie rights.

1184
01:16:34,241 --> 01:16:36,156
[Glass breaking]

1185
01:16:38,463 --> 01:16:40,813
Batman! Yeah!

1186
01:16:47,907 --> 01:16:50,083
Your entrance was good.
His was better.

1187
01:16:58,701 --> 01:17:01,529
The difference?
Showmanship.

1188
01:17:08,188 --> 01:17:10,800
Emergency, Alfred.

1189
01:17:10,843 --> 01:17:15,108
Oh, sir. I could
be fired for this, sir.

1190
01:17:15,152 --> 01:17:17,720
Perhaps they'll have me
back at Buckingham Palace.

1191
01:17:25,728 --> 01:17:28,426
Hee hee hee hee.

1192
01:17:28,469 --> 01:17:30,254
Hee hee hee--aah!

1193
01:17:30,297 --> 01:17:32,648
All right, boys,
phase two!

1194
01:17:36,913 --> 01:17:38,915
My place...midnight.

1195
01:17:43,397 --> 01:17:45,791
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

1196
01:17:50,013 --> 01:17:51,101
Ha ha!

1197
01:17:51,144 --> 01:17:52,493
Hee hee ha!

1198
01:18:00,327 --> 01:18:01,328

Hee ha!

1199
01:18:01,372 --> 01:18:02,416
Whoo!

1200
01:18:02,460 --> 01:18:03,417

Ha ha!

1201
01:18:05,419 --> 01:18:07,595
Ha ha!

1202
01:18:20,304 --> 01:18:22,523
Ha ha ha ha ha.

1203
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:35,232
Ha ha ha ha! Whoo!

1204
01:18:38,235 --> 01:18:40,367
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1205
01:18:50,769 --> 01:18:53,641
Nothing like a bad
case of gas. Ha ha!

1206
01:19:06,829 --> 01:19:10,136
Ah ha ha ha ha
ha ha ha!

1207
01:19:12,704 --> 01:19:14,619
Ha ha ha--

1208
01:19:25,717 --> 01:19:28,589
Why can't you just die!

1209
01:19:42,168 --> 01:19:44,780
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1210
01:19:44,823 --> 01:19:46,303
Ha ha ha ha!

1211
01:20:20,380 --> 01:20:21,729

Hi.

1212
01:20:28,606 --> 01:20:30,216
What the hell
were you doing?

1213
01:20:30,260 --> 01:20:32,740
You got a real
gratitude problem.

1214
01:20:32,784 --> 01:20:36,309
I need a name--
Batboy, Nightwing.

1215
01:20:36,353 --> 01:20:38,616
What do you think?
What's a good
sidekick name?

1216
01:20:38,659 --> 01:20:40,618
How about "Dick Grayson,
college student?"

1217
01:20:40,661 --> 01:20:41,967
Screw you!

1218
01:20:42,011 --> 01:20:44,448
I just saved your life.
You owe me.

1219
01:20:44,491 --> 01:20:46,493
You're totally
out of control.

1220
01:20:46,537 --> 01:20:48,060
You're looking
at your new partner.

1221
01:20:48,104 --> 01:20:49,670
No!

1222
01:20:49,714 --> 01:20:51,934
Whenever
you go out at night,
I'll be watching.

1223
01:20:51,977 --> 01:20:54,719
Wherever Batman goes,
I'll be right
beside him.

1224
01:20:54,762 --> 01:20:56,460
How will you stop me?

1225
01:20:56,503 --> 01:20:58,984
I can stop you.

1226
01:20:59,028 --> 01:21:00,725
Ahem.

1227
01:21:00,768 --> 01:21:02,901
Al,

1228
01:21:02,945 --> 01:21:05,208
hang this next
to the Batsuit...

1229
01:21:05,251 --> 01:21:07,297
where it belongs.

1230
01:21:11,605 --> 01:21:14,478
And you're
encouraging him.

1231
01:21:14,521 --> 01:21:18,395
Young men with a mind
for revenge need
little encouragement.

1232
01:21:18,438 --> 01:21:21,441
They need guidance.

1233
01:21:21,485 --> 01:21:25,576
You, above all, should
know the consequences
of the life you choose.

1234
01:21:33,627 --> 01:21:36,804
Even Chase calls
being Batman a curse.

1235
01:21:36,848 --> 01:21:39,633
Perhaps the lady is just
what the doctor ordered.

1236
01:21:39,677 --> 01:21:42,593
She seems
lovely and wise.

1237
01:21:42,636 --> 01:21:45,813
I've never been
in love before, Alfred.

1238
01:21:45,857 --> 01:21:48,904
Go to her.

1239
01:21:48,947 --> 01:21:50,906
Tell her how you feel.

1240
01:21:50,949 --> 01:21:53,560
She wants Batman,
not Bruce Wayne.

1241
01:21:53,604 --> 01:21:56,215
Let the lady
decide, hmm?

1242
01:22:49,703 --> 01:22:53,098
I'm sorry. I...

1243
01:22:53,142 --> 01:22:55,100
I can't
believe this. I...

1244
01:22:55,144 --> 01:22:58,190
I've imagined this moment
since I first saw you.

1245
01:22:58,234 --> 01:23:01,454
Your...your eyes.

1246
01:23:01,498 --> 01:23:03,717
Your lips.

1247
01:23:03,761 --> 01:23:05,850

Your body.

1248
01:23:08,418 --> 01:23:11,595
And now I
have you, and...

1249
01:23:11,638 --> 01:23:14,250
I'm wishing you
were somebody else.

1250
01:23:17,296 --> 01:23:19,429
Oh!

1251
01:23:19,472 --> 01:23:22,606
I guess a girl has
to grow up sometime.

1252
01:23:24,738 --> 01:23:26,784
I've met someone.

1253
01:23:26,827 --> 01:23:28,394
He's...

1254
01:23:31,049 --> 01:23:33,791
Well, he's--
he's not you.

1255
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:37,969
I hope you
can understand.

1256
01:23:43,540 --> 01:23:45,411
I understand.

1257
01:23:49,415 --> 01:23:51,243
Well...

1258
01:24:07,390 --> 01:24:08,391
Aah!

1259
01:24:08,434 --> 01:24:10,567
[Sobbing]

1260
01:24:13,483 --> 01:24:16,225
That's just what I said.

1261
01:24:16,268 --> 01:24:19,880
Then I taught my doggy
a new trick.

1262
01:24:19,924 --> 01:24:21,969
How to map
the human mind.

1263
01:24:22,013 --> 01:24:23,841
Would you like to see

1264
01:24:23,884 --> 01:24:27,671
what Bruce Wayne
has in his head? Hmm?

1265
01:24:27,714 --> 01:24:29,890
Whooooo!

1266
01:24:39,248 --> 01:24:41,380
Riddle me this.

1267
01:24:41,424 --> 01:24:45,776
What kind of a man
has bats on the brain?

1268
01:24:45,819 --> 01:24:49,040
Ooh ooh ooh!
Ha ha ha!

1269
01:24:49,084 --> 01:24:51,390
Go ahead,
you can say it.

1270
01:24:51,434 --> 01:24:54,089
You're a genius.
Oh, stop!

1271
01:24:56,526 --> 01:24:59,964
So, from this day on,

1272
01:25:00,007 --> 01:25:02,184
Batman is no more.

1273
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:06,927
You can't just quit.
There's monsters out there.

1274
01:25:06,971 --> 01:25:09,495
Batman has to
protect the innocent.

1275
01:25:09,539 --> 01:25:13,195
I've dedicated my life
to helping strangers
I've never met,

1276
01:25:13,238 --> 01:25:15,197
faces I've never seen.

1277
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:19,723
Well, the innocent
aren't faceless anymore.

1278
01:25:19,766 --> 01:25:21,507
You can't tell me

1279
01:25:21,551 --> 01:25:24,293
what I'm going to do
with the rest of my life.

1280
01:25:24,336 --> 01:25:27,339
My dad told me that
every man goes his own way.

1281
01:25:27,383 --> 01:25:29,950
Well, my way
goes to Two-Face.

1282
01:25:29,994 --> 01:25:32,257
You got to help me.

1283
01:25:32,301 --> 01:25:34,172
And if you
do find Harvey

1284
01:25:34,216 --> 01:25:36,696
and then you kill him,
what next?

1285
01:25:38,002 --> 01:25:39,917
[Sighs]

1286
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:42,572
Exactly.

1287
01:25:42,615 --> 01:25:44,704
Then you'd be alone,
like me.

1288
01:25:47,490 --> 01:25:50,145
No, you've
got to let this go.

1289
01:25:50,188 --> 01:25:52,147
Listen to me, Dick,
I'm your friend.

1290
01:25:52,190 --> 01:25:54,758
I don't need a friend.
I need a partner.

1291
01:25:54,801 --> 01:25:57,717
Two-Face
has got to pay.

1292
01:25:57,761 --> 01:25:59,458
Please.

1293
01:26:01,330 --> 01:26:03,288
Chase is coming over
for dinner.

1294
01:26:03,332 --> 01:26:05,682
I'm going
to tell her...

1295
01:26:05,725 --> 01:26:07,553
everything.

1296
01:26:09,381 --> 01:26:11,427
Come on upstairs.
We'll talk.

1297
01:26:26,268 --> 01:26:27,791
Good evening,
Dr Meridian.

1298
01:26:27,834 --> 01:26:29,140
Good evening, Alfred.

1299
01:26:29,184 --> 01:26:30,533
Happy Halloween.

1300
01:26:30,576 --> 01:26:32,709
Happy Halloween
to you.

1301
01:27:06,786 --> 01:27:08,788
Well, I asked you
here tonight

1302
01:27:08,832 --> 01:27:11,791
because there's something
I wanted to tell you.

1303
01:27:11,835 --> 01:27:14,403
I wanted to tell you
something, too.

1304
01:27:14,446 --> 01:27:15,447
Um...

1305
01:27:15,491 --> 01:27:17,362
What I wanted--

1306
01:27:17,406 --> 01:27:19,712
Go ahead.
You go first.

1307
01:27:19,756 --> 01:27:21,671
All right, okay., um...

1308
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:25,936
trick or treat!

1309
01:27:27,590 --> 01:27:30,288
All my life,
I have been...

1310
01:27:30,332 --> 01:27:33,248
I've been attracted to
a certain kind of man.

1311
01:27:33,291 --> 01:27:35,162
Uh, the wrong
kind of man.

1312
01:27:35,206 --> 01:27:38,122
And, I mean, look
what I do for a living,
right?

1313
01:27:40,255 --> 01:27:44,781
And since--
since I met you, I...

1314
01:27:46,652 --> 01:27:48,524
Oh, God.

1315
01:27:48,567 --> 01:27:50,917
Why am I so nervous?

1316
01:27:50,961 --> 01:27:51,962
Oh!

1317
01:27:58,273 --> 01:28:00,231
And don't eat
too much tonight,

1318
01:28:00,275 --> 01:28:02,886
or you'll be sick
in your beds.

1319
01:28:33,482 --> 01:28:36,441
Happy Halloween!

1320
01:28:49,193 --> 01:28:51,064
Bruce, what's wrong?

1321
01:28:51,108 --> 01:28:53,023
It's happening again.

1322
01:28:53,066 --> 01:28:55,242
Flashes--my...

1323
01:28:55,286 --> 01:28:57,419
parents' death.

1324
01:28:57,462 --> 01:29:00,422
Your memories are
trying to break through.
Don't fight them.

1325
01:29:00,465 --> 01:29:02,424
I want to
tell you something,

1326
01:29:02,467 --> 01:29:04,295
something I've
never told anyone.

1327
01:29:04,339 --> 01:29:05,905
It's all right.

1328
01:29:05,949 --> 01:29:08,125
It's all right.
I'm here.

1329
01:29:14,305 --> 01:29:16,133
I'm here.

1330
01:29:16,176 --> 01:29:18,004
And where
there is wrong,

1331
01:29:18,048 --> 01:29:20,224
I may bring
the spirit
of forgiveness.

1332
01:29:20,267 --> 01:29:22,705
 <i>The night of</i> 
<i>my parents' wake,</i>

1333
01:29:22,748 --> 01:29:25,098
 <i>the priest's words</i> 
<i>gave no comfort.</i>

1334
01:29:27,013 --> 01:29:29,842
 <i>Of course...</i>

1335
01:29:29,886 --> 01:29:31,714
 <i>there on</i> 
<i>my father's desk,</i>

1336
01:29:31,757 --> 01:29:33,933
 <i>the red book.</i>

1337
01:29:33,977 --> 01:29:38,068
 <i>His journal.</i> 
<i>He'd written in it</i> 
<i>every day of my life.</i>

1338
01:29:38,111 --> 01:29:41,767
 <i>But now he'd never</i> 
<i>write in it again.</i>

1339
01:29:41,811 --> 01:29:44,248
 <i>At that moment I knew</i>

1340
01:29:44,291 --> 01:29:47,033
 <i>my life would</i> 
<i>never be the same.</i>

1341
01:29:52,778 --> 01:29:55,651
 <i>I raced out</i> 
<i>into the storm,</i>

1342
01:29:55,694 --> 01:29:57,609
 <i>trying to</i> 
<i>outrun the rage,</i>

1343
01:29:57,653 --> 01:29:59,829
 <i>the pain.</i>

1344
01:29:59,872 --> 01:30:02,962
 <i>And then I fell.</i>

1345
01:30:03,006 --> 01:30:06,357
 <i>I fell forever.</i>

1346
01:30:06,401 --> 01:30:09,621
 <i>The cave was monstrous.</i>

1347
01:30:09,665 --> 01:30:12,668
 <i>It must have been</i> 
<i>there for centuries.</i>

1348
01:30:14,496 --> 01:30:17,847
 <i>And there,</i> 
<i>deep in the shadows...</i>

1349
01:30:20,589 --> 01:30:22,504
 <i>I saw...</i>

1350
01:30:24,506 --> 01:30:26,638
 <i>it was coming toward me.</i>

1351
01:30:26,682 --> 01:30:29,598
 <i>I was scared at first,</i> 
<i>but only at first.</i>

1352
01:30:31,077 --> 01:30:35,125
 <i>The figure in the dark</i> 
<i>was my destiny.</i>

1353
01:30:35,168 --> 01:30:37,867
 <i>It would change</i> 
<i>my life forever.</i>

1354
01:30:39,259 --> 01:30:41,348
 <i>I would use its image</i>

1355
01:30:41,392 --> 01:30:44,308
 <i>to strike terror</i> 
<i>into the hearts of</i> 
<i>those who did evil.</i>

1356
01:30:44,351 --> 01:30:46,789
 <i>I would ensure</i> 
<i>what happened to me</i>

1357
01:30:46,832 --> 01:30:49,444
 <i>would never happen</i> 
<i>to anyone else again.</i>

1358
01:30:49,487 --> 01:30:51,576
 <i>I would have my revenge.</i>

1359
01:30:55,275 --> 01:30:58,844
Bruce, what are you
trying to tell me?

1360
01:30:58,888 --> 01:31:00,977
Chase, I--I'm...

1361
01:31:36,099 --> 01:31:38,971
Trick or treat!

1362
01:31:44,455 --> 01:31:45,935
Trick.

1363
01:31:45,978 --> 01:31:47,676
Ha ha ha.

1364
01:31:53,116 --> 01:31:54,900
Remember the plan--

1365
01:31:54,944 --> 01:31:56,989
seize and capture.

1366
01:31:57,033 --> 01:31:58,338
No killing.

1367
01:31:58,382 --> 01:32:00,732
That goes
double for you.

1368
01:32:00,776 --> 01:32:02,342
Ha ha ha ha.

1369
01:32:03,561 --> 01:32:05,955
If I was a superhero,

1370
01:32:05,998 --> 01:32:08,523
where would I hide?

1371
01:32:12,570 --> 01:32:14,746
Spank me.

1372
01:32:27,454 --> 01:32:29,674
 <i>Intruder alert!</i> 
<i>Intruder alert!</i>

1373
01:32:29,718 --> 01:32:32,068
 <i>Intruder alert!</i> 
<i>Intruder alert!</i>

1374
01:32:32,111 --> 01:32:35,462
Intruder alert!
Intruder alert!

1375
01:32:35,506 --> 01:32:37,421
Shut up!

1376
01:32:47,126 --> 01:32:50,042
Now that's impressive!

1377
01:33:05,014 --> 01:33:07,103
You know,
it's always risky

1378
01:33:07,146 --> 01:33:10,236
introducing a tamed
animal into the wild.

1379
01:33:20,812 --> 01:33:22,901
Hee hee hee hee hee.

1380
01:33:22,945 --> 01:33:27,558
They may have trouble
adapting to their new
environment.

1381
01:33:39,048 --> 01:33:40,745
Hmm.

1382
01:33:42,268 --> 01:33:45,663
Hee hee hee hee hee
hee hee hee.

1383
01:33:56,152 --> 01:33:57,893
Yeah!

1384
01:34:05,030 --> 01:34:07,206
Somebody
tell the fat lady

1385
01:34:07,250 --> 01:34:09,121
she's on in five.

1386
01:34:27,444 --> 01:34:29,489
Joygasm!

1387
01:34:46,724 --> 01:34:48,117
Aah!

1388
01:34:50,772 --> 01:34:52,730
Get the girl!

1389
01:35:02,522 --> 01:35:04,481
No!

1390
01:35:04,524 --> 01:35:06,483
Don't kill him.

1391
01:35:07,919 --> 01:35:09,704
If you kill him...

1392
01:35:18,538 --> 01:35:20,932
he won't learn nothin'.

1393
01:35:28,723 --> 01:35:30,420
Bruce!

1394
01:35:30,463 --> 01:35:31,595
Bruce!

1395
01:35:31,638 --> 01:35:33,031

Bruce!

1396
01:35:33,815 --> 01:35:35,512
Bruce!

1397
01:35:35,555 --> 01:35:37,079
Bruce!

1398
01:35:55,837 --> 01:35:57,708

Master Bruce?

1399
01:36:00,667 --> 01:36:02,495
Master Bruce?

1400
01:36:05,063 --> 01:36:07,631
How are you,
young man?

1401
01:36:07,674 --> 01:36:11,026
You haven't called me
that for a long time.

1402
01:36:11,069 --> 01:36:13,376
Old habits
die hard.

1403
01:36:13,419 --> 01:36:15,421
Are you
all right?

1404
01:36:15,465 --> 01:36:17,815
Where's Chase?

1405
01:36:17,859 --> 01:36:20,209
I'm afraid they've
taken Dr Meridian.

1406
01:36:20,252 --> 01:36:22,907
Master Dick
has run away,

1407
01:36:22,951 --> 01:36:25,040
the cave has
been destroyed,

1408
01:36:25,083 --> 01:36:28,043
and there's
another riddle.

1409
01:36:37,966 --> 01:36:39,445
Uhh!

1410
01:36:39,489 --> 01:36:41,752
I'm coming,
my sweet.

1411
01:36:43,275 --> 01:36:44,711
Hah!

1412
01:36:44,755 --> 01:36:47,323
Like the jacket?

1413
01:36:47,366 --> 01:36:50,456
It keeps me safe
when I'm jogging
at night.

1414
01:36:50,500 --> 01:36:51,762
Ha ha ha.

1415
01:36:51,806 --> 01:36:54,591
Batman will
come for me.

1416
01:36:54,634 --> 01:36:57,202
[English accent]
Batman?

1417
01:36:57,246 --> 01:36:59,770
Batman, you say?

1418
01:36:59,814 --> 01:37:01,946

Coming for you?

1419
01:37:01,990 --> 01:37:03,730
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

1420
01:37:03,774 --> 01:37:05,341
Rrrr! Rrrr!

1421
01:37:05,384 --> 01:37:07,125
I'm...

1422
01:37:07,169 --> 01:37:09,214
counting on it!

1423
01:37:13,392 --> 01:37:16,787
What is that?
Where's that coming from?

1424
01:37:16,831 --> 01:37:18,615
There!

1425
01:37:18,658 --> 01:37:20,791
Who the hell's
doing that?

1426
01:37:20,835 --> 01:37:22,837
The Riddler.

1427
01:37:30,932 --> 01:37:34,892
In a-e-i-o-u.

1428
01:37:34,936 --> 01:37:36,415
Vowels.

1429
01:37:36,459 --> 01:37:38,287
Not entirely
unclever, sir,

1430
01:37:38,330 --> 01:37:40,942
but what do a clock,
a match,

1431
01:37:40,985 --> 01:37:43,074
chess pawns, and vowels
have in common?

1432
01:37:43,118 --> 01:37:44,641
What do
these riddles mean?

1433
01:37:44,684 --> 01:37:47,165
Every riddle has a
number in the question,

1434
01:37:47,209 --> 01:37:48,863
and they arrived
in this order--

1435
01:37:48,906 --> 01:37:51,648
13, 1, 8, and 5.

1436
01:37:51,691 --> 01:37:55,347
13, 1, 8, and 5.
What do they mean?

1437
01:37:55,391 --> 01:37:57,175
Perhaps letters
of the alphabet.

1438
01:37:57,219 --> 01:37:59,961
Of course,
13 is "M."

1439
01:38:00,004 --> 01:38:03,051
1 would be "A,"
8 would be "H,"
5 would be "E."

1440
01:38:03,094 --> 01:38:06,228
M-a-h-e.

1441
01:38:06,271 --> 01:38:09,144
Perhaps 1 and 8
are 18.

1442
01:38:09,187 --> 01:38:12,016
18 is "R."

1443
01:38:12,060 --> 01:38:14,889
M-r-e.

1444
01:38:14,932 --> 01:38:17,021
How about...

1445
01:38:17,065 --> 01:38:18,501
"Mr. E."?

1446
01:38:18,544 --> 01:38:19,545
Mystery.

1447
01:38:19,589 --> 01:38:20,938
An another name
for mystery?

1448
01:38:20,982 --> 01:38:22,461
Enigma.

1449
01:38:22,505 --> 01:38:24,420
Mr. E. Nygma.

1450
01:38:24,463 --> 01:38:26,726
Edward Nygma.

1451
01:38:26,770 --> 01:38:30,556
Stickley's suicide
was obviously
a computer-generated forgery.

1452
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:34,299
You really
are quite bright,
despite what people say.

1453
01:38:34,343 --> 01:38:36,606
Were all the Batsuits
destroyed, Alfred?

1454
01:38:36,649 --> 01:38:39,957
All except the prototype
with the sonar modifications
you invented.

1455
01:38:40,001 --> 01:38:42,046
But you haven't
tested it yet.

1456
01:38:42,090 --> 01:38:44,309
Tonight's
a good night.

1457
01:38:56,365 --> 01:38:58,845
What do you suggest,
Alfred, by sea...

1458
01:39:00,238 --> 01:39:02,284
or by air?

1459
01:39:06,070 --> 01:39:07,985
Why not both?

1460
01:39:16,776 --> 01:39:18,735
Who's your tailor?

1461
01:39:18,778 --> 01:39:20,824
I took
the liberty, sir.

1462
01:39:23,435 --> 01:39:26,177
"R"?
What's that stand for?

1463
01:39:28,397 --> 01:39:30,442
Robin.

1464
01:39:30,486 --> 01:39:33,576
Riddler and Two-Face
can make a pretty lethal
combination.

1465
01:39:33,619 --> 01:39:35,491
I figured you
could use a hand.

1466
01:39:35,534 --> 01:39:37,710
Two against two
are better odds.

1467
01:39:37,754 --> 01:39:41,018
I can't promise
I won't kill Harvey.

1468
01:39:41,062 --> 01:39:43,412
A man's got
to go his own way.

1469
01:39:43,455 --> 01:39:45,675
A friend taught me that.

1470
01:39:45,718 --> 01:39:47,677
Not just a friend...

1471
01:39:50,158 --> 01:39:51,681
A partner.

1472
01:40:07,566 --> 01:40:09,568
Ohh! Whoo-hoo!

1473
01:40:10,917 --> 01:40:12,658
Whoa!

1474
01:40:24,975 --> 01:40:27,238
He's not coming.

1475
01:40:27,282 --> 01:40:29,284
Shut it down.

1476
01:40:39,163 --> 01:40:41,122
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!

1477
01:40:47,258 --> 01:40:48,390
Hey!

1478
01:40:48,433 --> 01:40:49,565
Go!

1479
01:40:49,608 --> 01:40:50,609

Go!

1480
01:40:53,395 --> 01:40:55,353
Go! Go!

1481
01:41:16,983 --> 01:41:18,072
Hee hee hee.

1482
01:41:18,115 --> 01:41:20,248
Ha ha ha ha.

1483
01:41:20,291 --> 01:41:22,076
A-14.

1484
01:41:27,211 --> 01:41:29,648
Hit!Sweet.

1485
01:41:29,692 --> 01:41:30,823
B-12.

1486
01:41:34,871 --> 01:41:37,308
Hit! And my favorite
vitamin, I might add.

1487
01:41:37,352 --> 01:41:39,745
Ha ha ha.

1488
01:41:39,789 --> 01:41:42,183
Oh. Ha ha ha.

1489
01:41:47,449 --> 01:41:49,842
Oh, that
sinking feeling.

1490
01:41:49,886 --> 01:41:52,584
I like this game.
C-9.

1491
01:42:01,767 --> 01:42:03,595
Aah!

1492
01:42:03,639 --> 01:42:07,121
You sunk my battleship!Who, me?

1493
01:42:07,164 --> 01:42:08,861

Ha ha ha ha ha!

1494
01:42:32,189 --> 01:42:35,149
This is your captain speaking.
Please return to your seats.

1495
01:42:35,192 --> 01:42:38,108
We will be experiencing
turbulence.

1496
01:42:38,152 --> 01:42:40,676
Ha ha ha ha!

1497
01:42:43,722 --> 01:42:45,855
Aah!

1498
01:42:45,898 --> 01:42:47,117
I got him!

1499
01:42:53,950 --> 01:42:56,648
I hope they can find
the little black box.

1500
01:43:41,737 --> 01:43:43,129
Now...

1501
01:43:45,306 --> 01:43:48,700
the real game begins.

1502
01:43:55,054 --> 01:43:56,578
Holy rusted metal,
Batman!

1503
01:43:56,621 --> 01:43:57,840
Huh?

1504
01:43:57,883 --> 01:43:59,929
The ground--
it's all metal.

1505
01:43:59,972 --> 01:44:01,844
It's full
of holes, you know?

1506
01:44:01,887 --> 01:44:03,237
Holy.

1507
01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:04,673
Oh.

1508
01:44:07,589 --> 01:44:09,504
Robin, wait!

1509
01:44:11,027 --> 01:44:12,942
The whole island's
moving.

1510
01:44:59,510 --> 01:45:01,425
Ha ha!
Looking for us?

1511
01:45:05,951 --> 01:45:08,127
That was
for my mother!

1512
01:45:08,171 --> 01:45:10,173
My father!

1513
01:45:11,870 --> 01:45:14,438
My brother!

1514
01:45:14,482 --> 01:45:17,180
And this is
for me!

1515
01:45:17,223 --> 01:45:18,224
Aah!

1516
01:45:18,268 --> 01:45:19,922
Aah!

1517
01:45:46,905 --> 01:45:50,039
Finally,
justice is served.

1518
01:45:51,127 --> 01:45:53,216
Let us die.

1519
01:46:01,311 --> 01:46:04,488
You're a man
after our own heart, son.

1520
01:46:04,532 --> 01:46:06,708
I'll see you in hell.

1521
01:46:12,148 --> 01:46:14,280
I'd rather see you
in jail.

1522
01:46:18,459 --> 01:46:21,462
Oh, good boy.
Good boy.

1523
01:46:21,505 --> 01:46:23,551
The Bat has taught him
very well.

1524
01:46:23,594 --> 01:46:27,163
Noble.
Stupid, but noble.

1525
01:47:12,469 --> 01:47:16,125
Riddle me this,
riddle me that.

1526
01:47:16,168 --> 01:47:19,781
Who's afraid
of the big black bat?

1527
01:47:19,824 --> 01:47:22,131
No more tricks,
Edward.

1528
01:47:22,174 --> 01:47:24,089
Very well, then.

1529
01:47:28,267 --> 01:47:30,313
Let's get real.

1530
01:47:30,356 --> 01:47:32,489
Release Chase.
This is between
you and me.

1531
01:47:32,533 --> 01:47:33,664
And me.

1532
01:47:33,708 --> 01:47:35,840
And me!

1533
01:47:35,884 --> 01:47:38,539
Ha ha ha ha!

1534
01:47:38,582 --> 01:47:40,410
You've been sucking
Gotham's brain waves,

1535
01:47:40,454 --> 01:47:43,979
and now you've
devised a way
to read men's minds.

1536
01:47:44,022 --> 01:47:47,112
Ha ha ha!
You betcha!

1537
01:47:47,156 --> 01:47:50,333
Soon my little box
will be
on countless TVs

1538
01:47:50,376 --> 01:47:52,117
around the world,

1539
01:47:52,161 --> 01:47:54,729
feeding me
credit card numbers,

1540
01:47:54,772 --> 01:47:56,687
bank codes,

1541
01:47:56,731 --> 01:47:58,515
sexual fantasies,

1542
01:47:58,559 --> 01:48:01,518
and little
white lies.

1543
01:48:01,562 --> 01:48:03,607
Into my head
they'll go.

1544
01:48:03,651 --> 01:48:06,392
Victory
is inevitable.

1545
01:48:06,436 --> 01:48:09,178
For if knowledge
is power,

1546
01:48:09,221 --> 01:48:11,049
then a god...

1547

[Deep voice]

[Inhaling]

1550
01:48:21,364 --> 01:48:24,541
Was that over the top?
I can never tell.

1551
01:48:24,585 --> 01:48:27,109
Ha ha ha ha!

1552
01:48:27,152 --> 01:48:29,894
By the way,
I've seen your mind.

1553
01:48:29,938 --> 01:48:31,287
Freak!

1554
01:48:31,330 --> 01:48:33,332
Yours is the greatest
riddle of all.

1555
01:48:33,376 --> 01:48:37,336
Can Bruce Wayne and Batman
ever truly co-exist?

1556
01:48:37,380 --> 01:48:39,556
We'll find out today!

1557
01:48:39,600 --> 01:48:41,732
But first...

1558
01:48:41,776 --> 01:48:44,256
let's meet our contestants.

1559
01:48:44,300 --> 01:48:49,523
Behind curtain
number one...

1560
01:48:52,134 --> 01:48:56,094
the absolutely fabulous
Dr Chase Meridian.

1561
01:48:56,138 --> 01:48:59,054
She enjoys hiking,
getting her nails done,

1562
01:48:59,097 --> 01:49:03,188
and foolishly hopes
to be the love of Bruce's life.

1563
01:49:03,232 --> 01:49:04,233
Ha ha!

1564
01:49:04,276 --> 01:49:06,017
Ha!

1565
01:49:06,061 --> 01:49:08,716
And behind curtain
number two...

1566
01:49:12,981 --> 01:49:15,592
Fatman's
one-and-only partner.

1567
01:49:15,636 --> 01:49:17,333
This acrobat-turned-orphan

1568
01:49:17,376 --> 01:49:19,335
likes Saturday
morning cartoons

1569
01:49:19,378 --> 01:49:21,293
and dreams
of one day

1570
01:49:21,337 --> 01:49:24,079
being bare naked
with a girl.

1571
01:49:24,122 --> 01:49:25,123
Ha!

1572
01:49:25,167 --> 01:49:26,603
Hee hee!

1573
01:49:26,647 --> 01:49:29,606
And below
these contestants,

1574
01:49:29,650 --> 01:49:32,000
my personal favorite--

1575
01:49:32,043 --> 01:49:36,004
a watery grave!

1576
01:49:36,047 --> 01:49:38,572
Just one little touch

1577
01:49:38,615 --> 01:49:40,661
and five seconds later,

1578
01:49:40,704 --> 01:49:42,924
these two day-players
are gull feed

1579
01:49:42,967 --> 01:49:44,969
on the rocks below.

1580
01:49:45,013 --> 01:49:46,797
Ha!

1581
01:49:46,841 --> 01:49:49,626
Not enough time
to save them both.

1582
01:49:49,670 --> 01:49:51,585
Ooh!

1583
01:49:53,064 --> 01:49:55,545
Which one will it be,
Batman,

1584
01:49:55,589 --> 01:50:00,028
Bruce's love,
or the Dark Knight's
junior partner?

[Imitates clock ticking]

1586
01:50:02,552 --> 01:50:06,295
There is no way for me
to save them or myself.

1587
01:50:06,338 --> 01:50:09,080
This is all
one giant death trap.

1588
01:50:09,124 --> 01:50:10,125
Judges?

1589
01:50:10,168 --> 01:50:12,214
[Imitates buzzer]

1590
01:50:12,257 --> 01:50:15,957
I'm sorry. Your answer
must be in the form
of a question.

1591
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,263
Wait.

1592
01:50:18,307 --> 01:50:20,352
I have a riddle
for you.

1593
01:50:20,396 --> 01:50:22,267
For me?

1594
01:50:22,311 --> 01:50:24,269
Really?

1595
01:50:24,313 --> 01:50:27,795
Ha ha ha!

1596
01:50:27,838 --> 01:50:29,405
Tell me.

1597
01:50:32,234 --> 01:50:35,019
I see without seeing.

1598
01:50:35,063 --> 01:50:38,022
To me, darkness
is as clear as daylight.

1599
01:50:39,720 --> 01:50:41,809
What am I?

1600
01:50:41,852 --> 01:50:44,028
Please!

1601
01:50:44,072 --> 01:50:46,727
You're as blind
as a bat!

1602
01:50:46,770 --> 01:50:48,772
Exactly.

1603
01:50:53,864 --> 01:50:55,649
Aah!

1604
01:50:55,692 --> 01:50:56,693
Nooooo!

Eeeeeaaaaah!

1609

Bummer.

All those heroics
for nothing.

01:52:55,203 --> 01:52:57,335
Aren't you forgetting
something, Harvey?

1617
01:52:57,379 --> 01:53:00,208
Your coin.

1618
01:53:00,251 --> 01:53:03,472
You're always of two minds
about everything.

1619
01:53:03,515 --> 01:53:05,822
Yes, of course.
You're right, Bruce.

1620
01:53:05,866 --> 01:53:08,607
Emotion's
always the enemy
of true justice.

1621
01:53:08,651 --> 01:53:11,001
Thank you.
You've always been
a good friend.

1622
01:53:15,092 --> 01:53:17,225
Aah!

1623
01:53:17,268 --> 01:53:18,792
Aah!

1624
01:53:18,835 --> 01:53:20,532
Aah!

1625
01:53:23,361 --> 01:53:25,189

Aah!

1626
01:53:57,831 --> 01:53:59,876
Why?

1627
01:53:59,920 --> 01:54:04,054
Why can't I kill you?

1628
01:54:05,664 --> 01:54:08,450
Ohh.
Too many questions.

1629
01:54:08,493 --> 01:54:10,844
Too many questions.

1630
01:54:10,887 --> 01:54:12,889

Poor Edward.

1631
01:54:12,933 --> 01:54:15,326
I had to save them
both.

1632
01:54:15,370 --> 01:54:19,287
You see, I'm both
Bruce Wayne
and Batman,

1633
01:54:19,330 --> 01:54:21,376
not because
I have to be.

1634
01:54:21,419 --> 01:54:24,553
Now, because
I choose to be.

1635
01:54:30,341 --> 01:54:32,909
Aah!

1636
01:54:32,953 --> 01:54:35,042
Aah!

1637
01:54:35,085 --> 01:54:38,959

Aah!

1638
01:54:48,446 --> 01:54:50,927
Thank you
for responding
to my request

1639
01:54:50,971 --> 01:54:52,929
for a consultation,
Dr Meridian.

1640
01:54:52,973 --> 01:54:56,193
Edward Nygma
has been screaming
for hours

1641
01:54:56,237 --> 01:54:59,936
that he knows
the true identity
of Batman.

1642
01:55:13,297 --> 01:55:15,560
Edward?

1643
01:55:15,604 --> 01:55:19,390
Who...is it?

1644
01:55:21,175 --> 01:55:25,222
It's Dr Meridian.
Chase.

1645
01:55:25,266 --> 01:55:27,746
Do you remember me?

1646
01:55:29,052 --> 01:55:30,967
How could I forget?

1647
01:55:32,490 --> 01:55:38,148
Dr Burton tells me
you know who Batman is.

1648
01:55:38,192 --> 01:55:41,935
I can't tell you
if you don't say please.

1649
01:55:41,978 --> 01:55:47,114
Edward, please,
who is Batman?

1650
01:55:48,506 --> 01:55:52,206
I'm Batman!

1651
01:55:52,249 --> 01:55:54,338
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1652
01:55:55,949 --> 01:55:57,907
Ha ha ha ha!

1653
01:55:59,953 --> 01:56:03,478

Ha ha ha ha!

1654
01:56:03,521 --> 01:56:06,220
Ha ha ha ha!

1655
01:56:18,014 --> 01:56:22,801
Your secret is safe.
He's definitely a wacko.

1656
01:56:22,845 --> 01:56:26,370
Wacko? Is that
a technical term?

1657
01:56:26,414 --> 01:56:27,589
[Laughs]

1658
01:56:27,632 --> 01:56:28,764
Listen...

1659
01:56:32,289 --> 01:56:34,552
I won't be needing
this anymore.

1660
01:56:37,729 --> 01:56:40,515
Thank you
for giving me
a new dream.
