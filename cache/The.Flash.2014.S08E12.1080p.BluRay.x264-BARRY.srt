1
00:00:07,675 --> 00:00:09,344
<i>The universe is on fire.</i>

2
00:00:11,304 --> 00:00:13,806
<i>Heat, burning.</i>

3
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:19,354
<i>A perfect inferno set against
cold, endless nothing.</i>

4
00:00:20,605 --> 00:00:24,067
<i>But within some dimensions
there exists an aberration...</i>

5
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:26,611
<i>Life.</i>

6
00:00:30,281 --> 00:00:31,282
I owe you a real ring.

7
00:00:32,408 --> 00:00:33,408
I love you, Ronnie.

8
00:00:38,331 --> 00:00:42,669
<i>I have come to end that life.</i>

9
00:00:45,755 --> 00:00:49,634
<i>I am Deathstorm.</i>

10
00:00:58,476 --> 00:00:59,476
What are you?

11
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:01,813
Complete, thanks to you.

12
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:05,858
Now I'll return the favor.

13
00:01:36,514 --> 00:01:37,515
Get away from her!

14
00:01:46,566 --> 00:01:47,859
It's still not enough.

15
00:01:48,276 --> 00:01:52,530
But I'll be back,
and this life of yours will end.

16
00:01:57,994 --> 00:01:59,037
Caity?

17
00:02:00,204 --> 00:02:02,244
What the hell was that thing?

18
00:02:02,832 --> 00:02:04,542
I don't know.
Whatever it was,

19
00:02:04,626 --> 00:02:06,252
my lightning didn't affect it.

20
00:02:06,461 --> 00:02:07,545
What's wrong with her?

21
00:02:13,092 --> 00:02:14,092
How do you feel?

22
00:02:14,886 --> 00:02:18,598
Lucky to be alive. So fine, I guess.

23
00:02:19,015 --> 00:02:20,808
Hold on. It burned her?

24
00:02:20,892 --> 00:02:24,062
But she looks okay,
and there aren't any marks or anything.

25
00:02:24,354 --> 00:02:25,355
Let's just call it a win.

26
00:02:27,065 --> 00:02:28,983
What was that thing anyway?

27
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:32,654
It calls itself Deathstorm.

28
00:02:37,617 --> 00:02:39,202
Like Firestorm, only...

29
00:02:39,285 --> 00:02:40,662
It wasn't Ronnie.

30
00:02:41,371 --> 00:02:42,413
It never was.

31
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:43,955
How do you know that?

32
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:45,291
Because it told me.

33
00:02:46,334 --> 00:02:49,087
Then what exactly is it,
and where did it come from?

34
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:52,006
I don't know. But whatever
we brought back from Piedmont Park,

35
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:54,008
that thing, it isn't human.

36
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:58,096
It said Ronnie's death gave him life.

37
00:02:58,262 --> 00:03:00,348
And when Ronnie was gone,
it became something more.

38
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:02,433
Something incomplete.

39
00:03:03,935 --> 00:03:06,521
And that I helped make it whole again.

40
00:03:07,605 --> 00:03:10,024
That's why it wanted you
to modify the Firestorm Matrix.

41
00:03:10,108 --> 00:03:12,828
So that I could bring it back
from whatever hell it's been hiding in.

42
00:03:13,528 --> 00:03:15,279
Barry, I'm so sorry.

43
00:03:15,446 --> 00:03:17,566
You were right this whole time,
and I wouldn't listen.

44
00:03:17,782 --> 00:03:19,534
Hey, it's okay.

45
00:03:19,617 --> 00:03:21,744
You just did what any one of us
would have done.

46
00:03:21,828 --> 00:03:24,455
No. Ronnie's been dead for seven years.

47
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:27,667
And now this thing is back in his place,

48
00:03:27,792 --> 00:03:29,001
all because of me.

49
00:03:29,085 --> 00:03:31,546
You're okay now
and that's all that matters.

50
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:32,989
Barry, if Caitlin's right,

51
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:36,467
if Deathstorm wanted Caitlin
for some creepy resurrection...

52
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:39,429
Why is he trying to kill her now?
He got what he wanted.

53
00:03:39,512 --> 00:03:40,972
That's what we need to find out.

54
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:44,684
Well, Chuck is using satellites to try
and figure out where this thing went.

55
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:47,645
But if Frost is right
and it's coming back for Caity,

56
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,272
we need to keep her safe.

57
00:03:49,355 --> 00:03:50,523
We will.

58
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,580
And we're gonna send this thing back
to whatever hell it came from.

59
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:58,072
How? The Cold Fusion Sphere
has been destroyed.

60
00:03:58,156 --> 00:03:59,365
We'll find another way.

61
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:01,492
Until then, Frost?

62
00:04:01,576 --> 00:04:02,576
I'm way ahead of you.

63
00:04:02,577 --> 00:04:05,205
If this matchhead thinks
he's getting anywhere near my sister,

64
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:06,831
he's got to go through me first.

65
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:14,756
Hey, I heard what happened.
How can I help?

66
00:04:14,839 --> 00:04:19,010
Thank you. But we're not even sure
what we're dealing with yet.

67
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:20,094
Barry...

68
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:23,240
Look, from the second
I walked into S.T.A.R. Labs,

69
00:04:23,264 --> 00:04:26,726
I could feel how worried you are.

70
00:04:27,393 --> 00:04:29,479
But what I'm sensing,

71
00:04:29,562 --> 00:04:32,356
it's way more than just concern.

72
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,611
You're hurting. Badly.

73
00:04:38,446 --> 00:04:39,739
Honey, what's going on?

74
00:04:40,865 --> 00:04:41,866
It's Iris.

75
00:04:42,742 --> 00:04:43,700
Is she okay?

76
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:45,077
That's just it. I don't know.

77
00:04:45,578 --> 00:04:48,015
What's even worse is I don't even know
where she is right now.

78
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:50,792
What are you talking about? I thought
she was in Coast City with Sue.

79
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,376
Yeah, she was. Only now...

80
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:56,297
Oh, thank...

81
00:04:56,298 --> 00:04:57,924
Cecile, I...
Iris is back. I gotta go.

82
00:05:03,179 --> 00:05:05,282
Iris, thank God you're back.
Sue said you'd vanished...

83
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:06,307
No, Barry!

84
00:05:08,726 --> 00:05:09,726
What's wrong?

85
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:14,148
Renee Wazzo.

86
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:17,401
Tinya's mom.
I'm the last person that she touched.

87
00:05:17,485 --> 00:05:18,736
And she's...

88
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:23,157
gone, because of me,
because of my time sickness.

89
00:05:26,035 --> 00:05:27,161
Okay.

90
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,957
But then Sue said that
Tinya attacked you,

91
00:05:31,082 --> 00:05:33,960
that she made you disappear on purpose.

92
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:35,795
So how did you survive?

93
00:05:37,797 --> 00:05:38,797
Your time sickness.

94
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:44,846
It must have pulled you into
the Still Force at that exact moment.

95
00:05:45,471 --> 00:05:48,349
So whatever is making her sick
might have also saved her life.

96
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:50,643
Okay, that's... that's freaky.

97
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:53,437
I'm gonna give you guys some space.

98
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:55,439
I'll be back, okay?

99
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:05,116
Barry, what happened to Tinya's mom,
I didn't mean to...

100
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,702
I know that. Look, it's gonna be okay.

101
00:06:07,785 --> 00:06:08,785
Hey.

102
00:06:09,412 --> 00:06:10,412
I'm not afraid.

103
00:06:16,335 --> 00:06:17,335
What is it?

104
00:06:18,504 --> 00:06:21,382
Barry, the Still Force,
it's supposed to be a place where

105
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,469
all time exists.
Past, present and future.

106
00:06:25,553 --> 00:06:27,096
But when I was there,

107
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:31,976
I saw moments from before,
even when I was a little girl up to now.

108
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:36,647
But I didn't see my future.

109
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:40,985
What if I don't have one anymore?

110
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:42,153
You do.

111
00:06:45,156 --> 00:06:46,156
With me.

112
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:13,683
Hello?

113
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:18,731
Who's there?

114
00:07:41,963 --> 00:07:45,424
So, how does one summon a Force god?

115
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:49,261
Well, I mean,
they've had appointments before,

116
00:07:49,345 --> 00:07:52,932
but usually all Iris has to do
is concentrate and Deon knows to appear.

117
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,817
A few weeks ago, I gave Captain Kramer
an emergency alert to summon the Flash,

118
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,319
and this is the first time
she's used it. Which means...

119
00:08:05,403 --> 00:08:07,822
It's serious.
As in, "you gotta go" serious.

120
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:10,116
Yeah, but, Iris,
I can't leave you here alone.

121
00:08:11,951 --> 00:08:13,619
Hey, she won't be.

122
00:08:14,453 --> 00:08:15,913
Yeah. No, it's okay.

123
00:08:15,997 --> 00:08:17,498
Okay. But...

124
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:20,251
Barry, with everything that's happening,
and now with Deathstorm,

125
00:08:20,668 --> 00:08:22,003
people need you more than ever.

126
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:24,672
Go.

127
00:08:32,263 --> 00:08:33,263
Yeah, I get it.

128
00:08:34,265 --> 00:08:35,474
Waiting sucks.

129
00:08:37,143 --> 00:08:38,663
You know what might make
it suck less?

130
00:08:39,437 --> 00:08:42,523
A five-course meal from Angelino's
delivered straight to your door.

131
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:43,983
We could eat our problems away.

132
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:46,027
Food as a distraction?

133
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,114
- You're a bad influence.
- I'll take that as a yes.

134
00:08:51,866 --> 00:08:52,866
Thank you.

135
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:54,367
You're welcome.

136
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,849
A skull-faced thing flew down
from the sky and took your wife?

137
00:08:58,873 --> 00:09:01,459
Ma'am, please, try to remain calm.

138
00:09:02,043 --> 00:09:03,335
And nothing else was burned?

139
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:04,670
Just the body?

140
00:09:05,463 --> 00:09:07,048
Can you describe the figure?

141
00:09:08,466 --> 00:09:09,717
A living skeleton?

142
00:09:14,305 --> 00:09:16,766
This is the tenth burn victim
in half as many months,

143
00:09:16,849 --> 00:09:18,849
and now you're saying
it's going to get even worse?

144
00:09:19,727 --> 00:09:20,853
It already has.

145
00:09:22,188 --> 00:09:25,524
Sorry to interrupt, Captain. Joe, Flash.

146
00:09:25,608 --> 00:09:29,153
But we've got three more confirmed
burn vics downtown, another two uptown,

147
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,280
and at least four reported
on the Lower East Side.

148
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:34,700
And the phones are ringing off the hook
about a skull-faced demon.

149
00:09:34,784 --> 00:09:36,744
He calls himself Deathstorm.

150
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:39,538
Have Matlin call in every unit
for backup.

151
00:09:39,622 --> 00:09:41,016
We need all hands on deck for this.

152
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,040
Copy.

153
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:43,821
Glad to have you with us, Flash.

154
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:47,838
So, why is this thing
burning people alive?

155
00:09:47,922 --> 00:09:51,008
We're not sure.
But the current theory is...

156
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:53,677
to feed off their grief.

157
00:09:55,096 --> 00:09:56,347
How do we fight him?

158
00:09:57,098 --> 00:09:58,099
We don't know yet.

159
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:01,936
One thing I do know about Team Flash
is they'll find a way.

160
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:04,230
I don't know what's more terrifying,

161
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,732
that this Deathstorm
can turn up anywhere

162
00:10:06,816 --> 00:10:09,235
or that not even the Flash
is powerful enough to stop him.

163
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:11,320
Look, Kristen,
I know this seems hopeless, but...

164
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:13,072
It's not just that.

165
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:16,200
Joe, how the hell did you
use to deal with this?

166
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:20,121
For the past 17 years,
I've been either a soldier or a cop,

167
00:10:20,204 --> 00:10:22,581
and nothing I've done
prepared me for this.

168
00:10:22,665 --> 00:10:24,542
Look, I hear you. When I was captain,

169
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:27,211
I fought evils in this town
I didn't know existed.

170
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:28,963
So I know exactly where you are.

171
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:33,050
Looking out into the unknown
at something that you cannot stop.

172
00:10:33,134 --> 00:10:37,263
But I always had a friend
to watch my back.

173
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:38,806
Just like you do now.

174
00:10:39,557 --> 00:10:40,557
Joe's right.

175
00:10:40,558 --> 00:10:43,270
Everyone has a weakness.
Deathstorm does, too.

176
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:44,728
We just have to find it.

177
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:47,064
Until then, what's the plan?

178
00:10:47,148 --> 00:10:49,066
I'll use my speed
to keep searching the city.

179
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:51,277
I can help you coordinate protocols,

180
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,989
so all of our officers are safe
and they can actually do their job.

181
00:10:55,906 --> 00:10:57,616
What, are you my adviser now, Joe?

182
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,118
That would be up to you, Captain.

183
00:11:00,411 --> 00:11:02,955
Remember, if you or any of your officers
see this thing...

184
00:11:03,038 --> 00:11:04,038
Don't worry.

185
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:06,584
You'll be the first to know.

186
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:08,294
I'll let you know what I find on my end.

187
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:12,423
Have faith.

188
00:11:13,299 --> 00:11:14,425
He'll find a way.

189
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:18,637
Until he does,
you and I have to lock down the city.

190
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:20,264
Let's get to work.

191
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,433
Listen up, everyone.

192
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:25,811
Our city is under attack.

193
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:27,229
Captain, is it true?

194
00:11:27,313 --> 00:11:28,582
There's some kind of fire ghost?

195
00:11:28,606 --> 00:11:31,233
Yes, and I suppose
that's as good a description as any.

196
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:34,445
To be honest,
we don't know much about our enemy.

197
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:36,864
But I can confirm
that the streets aren't safe

198
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:38,490
for anyone who is currently grieving.

199
00:11:38,824 --> 00:11:40,951
So if you've had
any upsetting news recently

200
00:11:41,035 --> 00:11:43,412
about a family member,
friend or loved one,

201
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:46,373
please see myself or Joe immediately.

202
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:48,125
You're not safe on the streets.

203
00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:50,628
The rest of us will be working
with the Flash and his team

204
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:52,129
to take this threat down together.

205
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:54,673
So, your orders are as follows.

206
00:11:54,757 --> 00:11:57,259
Do not engage this monster.

207
00:11:57,343 --> 00:12:01,013
We need to protect this city
by keeping civilians out of harm's way.

208
00:12:01,597 --> 00:12:03,682
The Flash and his team
will do the heavy lifting.

209
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:05,684
Now, Martinez, Howe,

210
00:12:05,768 --> 00:12:07,311
send out a city-wide lockdown alert.

211
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:08,812
We need everyone off the streets.

212
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:12,691
Korber, Matlin, gather teams
to set up a perimeter grid.

213
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:15,653
I want eyes and ears
on every street corner we can manage.

214
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:17,029
Anyone sees this thing,

215
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:19,156
call it in,
then get yourselves to safety.

216
00:12:20,783 --> 00:12:23,744
I have looked through all the evidence
on Deathstorm's past attacks

217
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:25,996
and still no clues as to where he went.

218
00:12:26,664 --> 00:12:29,375
So far, every grid
has turned up nothing.

219
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,543
And satellites are still a dead end.

220
00:12:31,669 --> 00:12:34,046
Hey, what about the CCC Media tip line?

221
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:36,548
Nothing yet.
And I have the bullpen on alert.

222
00:12:36,674 --> 00:12:41,679
It's like he shows up just to feed
and then disappears into thin air.

223
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:43,681
It's like a ghost.

224
00:12:44,265 --> 00:12:47,017
It's not a ghost,
so he's got to be hiding somewhere.

225
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:50,562
Hey. How you guys doing?

226
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:54,316
Never mind. I already know.

227
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,520
I can feel your frustration
from the med lab. Chester,

228
00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:59,530
I thought that we had a way
to track these black fires.

229
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:00,614
We did.

230
00:13:00,698 --> 00:13:04,201
But ever since our new big bad
turned from black flames

231
00:13:04,285 --> 00:13:06,954
into a fiery walking-and-talking corpse,

232
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:09,456
he's become untraceable.

233
00:13:10,082 --> 00:13:11,083
How's Caitlin?

234
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:14,295
She and Frost are moving
into the speed lab.

235
00:13:15,087 --> 00:13:17,214
Physically, Caitlin is fine.

236
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:19,216
But she's still pretty shaken up.

237
00:13:20,551 --> 00:13:22,886
Yeah, because even though
you can hide emotions,

238
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,555
you can't get rid of them.

239
00:13:26,682 --> 00:13:30,102
Guys, we don't need the satellites
to search for Deathstorm.

240
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:36,567
Cecile, you're going to help us
find him.

241
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:51,290
So, wait. You want to use Cecile
as, like, a Deathstorm compass?

242
00:13:51,457 --> 00:13:54,293
Think about it.
Deathstorm absorbs grief.

243
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,254
Grief is an emotion.

244
00:13:57,379 --> 00:13:58,380
My powers.

245
00:13:58,714 --> 00:14:02,718
My powers feel other people's emotions,
even from a distance.

246
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:05,763
If we could figure out a way
to interface Cecile's empath powers

247
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:07,306
with S.T.A.R.'s search systems,

248
00:14:07,723 --> 00:14:10,059
it would be like using
a wireless neurogenic array,

249
00:14:10,142 --> 00:14:13,729
synced with the med lab's
synaptic monitoring relay.

250
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:16,774
Holy Paschal Beverly Randolph.

251
00:14:17,316 --> 00:14:18,317
Barry, this could work.

252
00:14:19,151 --> 00:14:20,486
Yeah, but...

253
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,781
syncing Cecile's mind up
with that thing,

254
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:25,824
it sounds pretty dangerous.

255
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:27,450
Allegra's right.

256
00:14:27,993 --> 00:14:30,371
Tapping into a pool of emotion
that large,

257
00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:32,664
it could overload your neural synapses.

258
00:14:35,084 --> 00:14:36,460
You sure you're okay with this?

259
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:41,215
This murderous bastard has
already killed more than a dozen people.

260
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:44,551
So, yeah, try and stop me.

261
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,474
I can't believe
I was so blind.

262
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:53,685
Frost, this all my fault.
I let that thing out.

263
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:55,771
No, I'm not going to let you go there.

264
00:14:56,397 --> 00:14:59,817
I mean, come on, we're on lockdown
because I went rogue.

265
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:02,528
All because I was so obsessed with...

266
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:04,571
reconnecting with the past.

267
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:07,866
Ronnie wasn't just your past.
He was your husband.

268
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:09,034
And Deathstorm knew that.

269
00:15:09,118 --> 00:15:11,846
Which is why he knew he could use it
to manipulate you into bringing him back

270
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:14,289
from whatever hellscape he comes from.

271
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:16,500
This isn't your fault, okay?

272
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:19,253
Isn't it? I mean, the whole city's
paying for my mistakes.

273
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:21,422
And as stupid as it sounds,

274
00:15:22,673 --> 00:15:25,884
I... I just feel like
I lost Ronnie all over again.

275
00:15:28,512 --> 00:15:29,888
Why does this hurt so much?

276
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,391
Because you loved him.

277
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:33,684
Hmm.

278
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:36,562
And even though it's been a long time,

279
00:15:37,396 --> 00:15:38,856
he'll always be a part of you,

280
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:40,732
and that's okay.

281
00:15:59,168 --> 00:16:01,044
- Oh, thank God.
- Oh.

282
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:03,714
Let me guess. The Still Force?

283
00:16:04,006 --> 00:16:05,006
Call me Deon.

284
00:16:05,424 --> 00:16:07,092
My headaches. They're getting worse.

285
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:09,470
Okay. I... I'll see what I can do.

286
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:12,639
You also said to tell you
if something happened.

287
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:14,725
Well, it did.

288
00:16:14,726 --> 00:16:16,852
Ah. Tinya's mom. I already know.

289
00:16:17,311 --> 00:16:18,729
Oh. Right.

290
00:16:19,271 --> 00:16:21,565
'Cause you can see past,
present and future.

291
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:22,774
Not in this case.

292
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:25,777
I actually only saw what happened
to Tinya's mom

293
00:16:25,861 --> 00:16:27,362
once it became part of the past,

294
00:16:27,446 --> 00:16:29,823
which ain't how things
are supposed to work.

295
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:35,454
My time sickness,
it's spreading into the Still Force.

296
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:37,456
That's why it took me so long
to get to you.

297
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:39,458
I've infected you, too, haven't I?

298
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,346
It's probably why
I didn't see this coming.

299
00:16:42,127 --> 00:16:43,462
Somehow I...

300
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:45,464
Somehow I'm getting sick, too.

301
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:48,175
What about Tinya's mom?

302
00:16:48,342 --> 00:16:51,595
Once I get my strength back,
I'll look for her. But, Iris...

303
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:55,974
I can see everyone's future
except for yours.

304
00:16:58,227 --> 00:17:00,312
We've got to slow down
whatever's happening,

305
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:02,147
because if we don't...

306
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:04,316
Iris is going to disappear again.

307
00:17:05,317 --> 00:17:07,736
Maybe for good this time.

308
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:12,365
Okay.

309
00:17:13,242 --> 00:17:14,409
Okay, okay.

310
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:18,163
We just...
We got to find a way to bring her back,

311
00:17:18,247 --> 00:17:21,500
because if she gets lost in space,
we need a way to find her.

312
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:31,426
Yeah. You remember that tracking app
that you guys used to find Tinya?

313
00:17:31,552 --> 00:17:33,053
- Yeah.
- Maybe I could do the same.

314
00:17:34,805 --> 00:17:37,516
Okay, it's pretty far out,
but, I mean, if it works...

315
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:39,225
Do it.

316
00:18:00,706 --> 00:18:02,466
I should be able to track
your movements now.

317
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:04,042
And in the meantime, you know,

318
00:18:04,126 --> 00:18:05,752
fight as hard as you can to stay here.

319
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,047
And do whatever you can
to just anchor yourself to the present.

320
00:18:14,595 --> 00:18:15,804
Yo, something's wrong.

321
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:35,073
Okay, so, I've linked up
a wireless neurogenic monitoring system

322
00:18:35,157 --> 00:18:36,408
to your cerebral cortex.

323
00:18:37,576 --> 00:18:38,576
You can do that?

324
00:18:38,869 --> 00:18:41,189
I'm pretty sure given enough time,
Chester can do anything.

325
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:43,373
Aw. Thanks, Barr.

326
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:45,375
So, yeah, all you need to do is

327
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:47,878
concentrate on
any large pockets of grief.

328
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,212
If we're right,

329
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:51,733
then that will lead us right to where
Deathstorm's been hiding.

330
00:18:51,757 --> 00:18:54,384
Once you get a hit,
I'll triangulate real time coordinates,

331
00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:55,926
find the location...

332
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:57,137
Then the Flash will take over.

333
00:18:57,763 --> 00:18:58,764
Works for me.

334
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:00,724
Are you ready?

335
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:04,101
Yeah.

336
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:05,437
Okay.

337
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:18,784
Oh, it's working. Keep going, Cecile.

338
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:34,633
Wait. There must be a glitch
or something. It says that...

339
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:36,510
It's coming from S.T.A.R. Labs.

340
00:19:52,734 --> 00:19:54,254
You're wasting your time.

341
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:57,823
You won't find me until I'm ready.

342
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:01,470
- Shut it down now. Shut it down.
- It won't work!

343
00:20:03,245 --> 00:20:04,746
The empath and I are one.

344
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:08,374
Deathstorm.

345
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:11,252
If you hurt her...

346
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:18,844
Don't bother with hollow threats.

347
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:21,221
You can't stop me.

348
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:27,602
The truth is, there is only one way
all of you survive...

349
00:20:27,686 --> 00:20:29,080
We're never going to give you Caitlin.

350
00:20:29,104 --> 00:20:30,647
Then I'll take her from you!

351
00:20:35,485 --> 00:20:41,408
I can taste the tiniest bits of sorrow
coming from you both.

352
00:20:42,868 --> 00:20:43,868
Mm.

353
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:46,621
They are so delicious.

354
00:20:47,873 --> 00:20:49,499
And exactly what I need.

355
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:51,084
You don't scare us.

356
00:20:53,211 --> 00:20:55,380
And you can't control us anymore.

357
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:57,382
We've already faced our grief.

358
00:20:57,716 --> 00:21:02,888
And yet, there's always
the smallest morsel left behind,

359
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,974
long after the loved one has passed.

360
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:12,773
Which is why you can't stop me.

361
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:23,742
Cecile?

362
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:25,410
Deathstorm!

363
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:29,581
He overwhelmed my emotions.
It... it was...

364
00:21:30,332 --> 00:21:32,167
It was horrible.

365
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:34,669
All that matters right now
is you're back with us.

366
00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:36,337
Okay?

367
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:38,215
Yeah.

368
00:21:40,091 --> 00:21:41,092
Barry,

369
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,930
I could feel his determination.

370
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:48,892
His sheer force of will.

371
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:56,274
Barry, he's never, ever gonna give up
on trying to get Caitlin.

372
00:22:18,964 --> 00:22:20,006
Esperanza.

373
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:11,683
Which would
make you his bitch.

374
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:16,521
Be careful, <i>prima.</i>
The juvie in you is starting to show.

375
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:18,481
Yeah, we're done.

376
00:23:23,194 --> 00:23:24,110
What was that?

377
00:23:24,112 --> 00:23:25,864
A localized explosion of some kind.

378
00:23:26,197 --> 00:23:28,825
Oh, if Pyro Pazuzu is back,
we could be under attack.

379
00:23:31,161 --> 00:23:32,913
Guys, I'm picking up a category three

380
00:23:32,996 --> 00:23:35,373
spectrum discharge
four levels beneath us.

381
00:23:35,874 --> 00:23:37,083
What could cause that?

382
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:39,878
A light-based detonation
on the electromagnetic spectrum.

383
00:23:40,337 --> 00:23:41,337
Allegra.

384
00:23:42,923 --> 00:23:43,923
What happened?

385
00:23:44,007 --> 00:23:45,508
Barry. Watch out, that thing...

386
00:23:45,967 --> 00:23:47,510
It looks like my cousin, but it isn't.

387
00:23:50,889 --> 00:23:54,684
It was right there. One of those
grief freaks, like Chuck's dad.

388
00:23:54,768 --> 00:23:56,436
But this time it looked like Esperanza.

389
00:23:59,189 --> 00:24:00,189
I...

390
00:24:00,273 --> 00:24:03,234
I knew it wasn't my cousin
as soon as I saw it.

391
00:24:03,318 --> 00:24:06,363
But when I fired, it fired back.

392
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:08,698
The blast knocked both of us out.

393
00:24:09,658 --> 00:24:10,700
Now it's gone.

394
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,040
Well, I'm just glad you're safe.

395
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:19,459
Yeah. Yeah, me, too.

396
00:24:20,377 --> 00:24:24,798
Only why is Deathstorm
trying to haunt me all of a sudden?

397
00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:33,389
We have no idea
what happened to Deon.

398
00:24:34,516 --> 00:24:35,642
Whatever's going on with me,

399
00:24:35,725 --> 00:24:37,727
it's not just my problem anymore.

400
00:24:38,061 --> 00:24:39,938
It's time fracturing itself.

401
00:24:40,397 --> 00:24:41,397
Okay.

402
00:24:42,691 --> 00:24:44,571
There's not much we can do
about that right now.

403
00:24:46,403 --> 00:24:49,406
But obsessing over it,
it's only gonna make things worse.

404
00:24:50,448 --> 00:24:54,619
Say, did I ever tell you about the time
that I crashed a royal wedding?

405
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,121
Spoiler alert,

406
00:24:56,204 --> 00:24:58,081
they don't arrest you
if you buy the castle.

407
00:25:00,417 --> 00:25:02,585
Right. Not the time.

408
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:04,963
More like not enough time.

409
00:25:06,297 --> 00:25:08,842
Do you know that being
married to a speedster

410
00:25:08,925 --> 00:25:12,762
affords you the ability to live
an entire day in a second?

411
00:25:14,764 --> 00:25:16,964
Makes you think that you have
all the time in the world.

412
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:20,185
We don't.

413
00:25:22,105 --> 00:25:23,481
And every moment is precious.

414
00:25:24,274 --> 00:25:25,274
Agreed.

415
00:25:26,109 --> 00:25:28,737
You know, I used to think
that Barry and I and our children,

416
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,822
that we had so much ahead of us. But...

417
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:35,118
Now it feels like I have no future.

418
00:25:35,493 --> 00:25:37,537
Look, you are Iris West-Allen.

419
00:25:38,496 --> 00:25:40,206
You are your own force of nature.

420
00:25:40,832 --> 00:25:44,294
I promise,
whatever time this world has left,

421
00:25:44,461 --> 00:25:46,629
it's not done with you yet,
not by a long shot.

422
00:25:52,135 --> 00:25:53,636
Okay, Iris, stay with me.

423
00:25:55,638 --> 00:25:57,098
This time stream, it's too strong.

424
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:01,978
Just remember what Deon said.

425
00:26:03,897 --> 00:26:07,400
Concentrate on being
right here, right now with me.

426
00:26:07,525 --> 00:26:09,027
I can't. I can't fight it.

427
00:26:09,152 --> 00:26:10,152
Hell yes, you can.

428
00:26:10,653 --> 00:26:11,654
You know why?

429
00:26:11,988 --> 00:26:14,199
Because you have
way too much to live for.

430
00:26:17,577 --> 00:26:20,497
Barry, Nora and Bart.

431
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:22,999
They need you, Iris.

432
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:25,919
You're their future and they're yours.

433
00:26:26,628 --> 00:26:27,828
Are you gonna give up on that?

434
00:26:28,171 --> 00:26:29,422
- No.
- No.

435
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:31,508
So fight this.

436
00:26:31,674 --> 00:26:33,510
You say that you can't see a future?

437
00:26:34,135 --> 00:26:35,845
Fine, anchor yourself to them.

438
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:38,807
Write yourself a new future.

439
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:41,351
Starting right now. You got that?

440
00:26:56,616 --> 00:26:57,616
Better?

441
00:26:58,701 --> 00:26:59,786
I'm still here.

442
00:27:00,078 --> 00:27:01,078
Yeah.

443
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:13,633
I know that look.

444
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,886
Kramer had it earlier.

445
00:27:19,222 --> 00:27:21,724
You're wondering
what to do now, too, huh?

446
00:27:24,561 --> 00:27:27,564
Using grief to track Deathstorm
was our best shot.

447
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:32,652
A long time ago,

448
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:39,242
I met someone who was
as unprepared as it gets.

449
00:27:40,577 --> 00:27:46,541
Young, inexperienced,
thrust into this whole new world

450
00:27:46,624 --> 00:27:51,421
that was sink or swim.
You know what happened?

451
00:27:53,256 --> 00:27:54,757
That he didn't see coming next?

452
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:59,721
DeVoe, Zoom,

453
00:28:01,264 --> 00:28:04,434
Cicada, Bloodwork.

454
00:28:06,978 --> 00:28:08,458
And you're still standing, ain't you?

455
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:10,773
What's happening now?

456
00:28:11,107 --> 00:28:14,611
Deathstorm's going after Caitlin.
I mean, how do we stop this thing

457
00:28:14,694 --> 00:28:16,696
if we don't even know
why she's the target?

458
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:17,780
Barr,

459
00:28:18,031 --> 00:28:20,992
all the resources, weapons
and planning in the world

460
00:28:21,075 --> 00:28:23,703
ain't going to help you prepare
for a monster like this.

461
00:28:24,787 --> 00:28:28,499
All that you can do
is be who you already are.

462
00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:32,462
Somebody willing to fight,
no matter what the odds are.

463
00:28:33,838 --> 00:28:36,466
So believe me when I say, don't worry.

464
00:28:37,967 --> 00:28:43,848
In due time, you will find a way
to get the advantage over Deathstorm.

465
00:28:44,349 --> 00:28:47,060
- And until that happens?
- You do what you do best.

466
00:28:48,728 --> 00:28:54,734
Run... into the unknown,
and trust yourself.

467
00:28:56,236 --> 00:29:00,240
Believe me, you're better prepared
than you think.

468
00:29:20,343 --> 00:29:21,343
Cait...

469
00:29:53,418 --> 00:29:56,212
Now your life ends.

470
00:30:03,386 --> 00:30:04,386
What happened?

471
00:30:04,762 --> 00:30:06,723
Deathstorm, he... he got in somehow.

472
00:30:07,348 --> 00:30:08,558
- Caitlin?
- He took her.

473
00:30:09,183 --> 00:30:10,184
What about Frost?

474
00:30:10,393 --> 00:30:11,393
Well, I scanned her vitals.

475
00:30:11,394 --> 00:30:13,896
She's still in the speed lab.
Alive, but not responding.

476
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:16,441
Hey, Barry, I'm tracking the GPS
on Caitlin's phone.

477
00:30:16,524 --> 00:30:19,444
Deathstorm's moving with her fast,
headed to who knows where.

478
00:30:19,569 --> 00:30:21,329
If we don't catch him
before he disappears...

479
00:30:21,362 --> 00:30:22,840
Check on Frost.
I'm gonna go after Caitlin.

480
00:30:22,864 --> 00:30:23,822
Chester, stay on comms.

481
00:30:23,823 --> 00:30:25,075
Yeah.

482
00:30:33,416 --> 00:30:34,416
Found 'em.

483
00:30:45,261 --> 00:30:46,804
He's too high, I can't reach him.

484
00:30:47,889 --> 00:30:50,266
Chester, my boots can redirect
most energy sources.

485
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,728
Does that include currents equal to
the kinetic output created when I run?

486
00:30:54,062 --> 00:30:57,065
Uh, it should, and the force
of those two equal energies

487
00:30:57,148 --> 00:30:59,067
would probably cancel each other out.

488
00:30:59,275 --> 00:31:00,835
It'd be like running into a brick wall.

489
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:02,320
I'm counting on it.

490
00:31:02,653 --> 00:31:04,280
Hold up. Hold on.

491
00:31:04,655 --> 00:31:06,592
Are you about to do
what I think you're about to do?

492
00:31:06,616 --> 00:31:08,701
<i>Yeah.
Time to ride the lightning.</i>

493
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:52,120
Chester, I've lost Caitlin.
Where'd they go?

494
00:31:52,703 --> 00:31:53,871
Uh, I don't know.

495
00:31:53,955 --> 00:31:56,475
One second you almost had them,
then they completely disappeared.

496
00:31:56,499 --> 00:31:57,500
We have to find them.

497
00:33:13,951 --> 00:33:16,621
If you're going to kill me,
just get it over with.

498
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:18,623
Why would I do that?

499
00:33:18,789 --> 00:33:21,667
I traveled across the stars
to transform you,

500
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:24,045
so you could end my loneliness.

501
00:33:25,505 --> 00:33:29,217
Because tonight, you become my bride.

502
00:33:43,981 --> 00:33:45,942
Uh, Flash, Caitlin just popped back up.

503
00:33:46,025 --> 00:33:49,362
She's at the Ripley's Wild World,
just outside the city.

504
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:04,961
Caitlin, what happened?

505
00:34:06,587 --> 00:34:07,713
Where's Deathstorm?

506
00:34:09,173 --> 00:34:10,173
Caitlin?

507
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:17,890
He said I'm not ready yet.

508
00:34:34,448 --> 00:34:35,741
It's incredible.

509
00:34:35,992 --> 00:34:39,453
All my vitals are elevated.
My blood pressure is lower

510
00:34:39,537 --> 00:34:40,681
and so is my body temperature.

511
00:34:40,705 --> 00:34:42,105
But that's not the strangest thing.

512
00:34:42,665 --> 00:34:46,627
My cells are in
a constant state of regenesis.

513
00:34:46,711 --> 00:34:50,715
It's like I'm not aging at all,
at least not the way I'm supposed to be.

514
00:34:51,632 --> 00:34:54,218
Why? Why would Deathstorm
try to make you stronger?

515
00:34:55,177 --> 00:34:56,177
Ow.

516
00:34:57,096 --> 00:34:58,389
Uh, Caitlin.

517
00:35:00,141 --> 00:35:04,228
I'm sensing a massive amount of grief
inside of you.

518
00:35:04,312 --> 00:35:05,312
It's...

519
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:07,898
It's enough for an entire family.

520
00:35:09,609 --> 00:35:12,945
When I found you at the park,
there were four more charred bodies.

521
00:35:13,654 --> 00:35:15,031
Deathstorm's calling card.

522
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:18,200
Okay, here's what I don't get.
The black flames that he emits,

523
00:35:18,284 --> 00:35:19,535
how come they don't hurt you?

524
00:35:19,702 --> 00:35:23,831
I don't think that they're supposed to.
I think that that's what's changing me.

525
00:35:25,207 --> 00:35:27,793
When Deathstorm attacked me again,

526
00:35:27,877 --> 00:35:31,380
he said "I traveled across the stars
to be with you."

527
00:35:32,423 --> 00:35:37,219
But that my transformation wasn't
complete, that I wasn't ready yet.

528
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,846
Ready for what?

529
00:35:40,222 --> 00:35:41,891
To be his bride?

530
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:54,278
I think he wants us to be together
in wherever it is that he's from.

531
00:35:55,237 --> 00:35:59,158
And that what's happening to me now
is something that he has to do

532
00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:01,077
to make sure I'm prepared.

533
00:36:02,745 --> 00:36:04,121
He was never trying to kill you.

534
00:36:05,331 --> 00:36:10,002
Barr, I know it sounds crazy,
but if Deathstorm is using the grief

535
00:36:10,086 --> 00:36:15,424
he consumes to change me
and he's saying he needs more...

536
00:36:16,592 --> 00:36:17,760
He's gonna feed again.

537
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:20,471
And as soon as he's full,
he's gonna come back for you.

538
00:36:21,097 --> 00:36:22,097
Okay, that's it.

539
00:36:22,098 --> 00:36:24,266
I am done waiting around
for the bachelor from hell

540
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:25,601
to come give Caity a rose.

541
00:36:25,685 --> 00:36:28,270
We need to find this sicko
and end him

542
00:36:28,479 --> 00:36:30,314
before he does anything worse
to my sister.

543
00:36:31,023 --> 00:36:32,023
Argh!

544
00:36:32,483 --> 00:36:33,609
- Ah.
- Hey.

545
00:36:34,443 --> 00:36:35,361
You okay?

546
00:36:35,362 --> 00:36:38,656
It's fine. I'm gonna be okay.
I just, uh... I gotta rest.

547
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:42,868
Frost, Cecile, stay with her.

548
00:36:43,661 --> 00:36:44,662
What are you gonna do?

549
00:36:44,787 --> 00:36:48,165
I'm going to find a way to end this.
We're more than just Team Flash.

550
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:49,291
We're a family.

551
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,353
And if anyone tries to hurt
a member of this family,

552
00:36:51,377 --> 00:36:53,129
we do whatever we can to stop them.

553
00:37:04,765 --> 00:37:07,184
Okay, Barr. So what now?

554
00:37:07,601 --> 00:37:08,787
Yeah, we might not have a plan,

555
00:37:08,811 --> 00:37:10,813
but now we know something
we didn't before.

556
00:37:10,896 --> 00:37:12,165
Something I'm hoping can help us.

557
00:37:12,189 --> 00:37:13,189
What's that?

558
00:37:14,567 --> 00:37:16,944
Where Deathstorm goes
when he disappears.

559
00:37:17,862 --> 00:37:20,197
So, when I was chasing Deathstorm,
he opened a portal.

560
00:37:20,281 --> 00:37:23,534
And even though I couldn't get
to Caitlin, I saw inside of it.

561
00:37:23,993 --> 00:37:25,035
Just for a moment.

562
00:37:25,745 --> 00:37:28,456
And guys, I've seen
space like that before.

563
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,419
Inside your singularity,
right before you joined the team.

564
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:36,088
Oh, no.

565
00:37:36,672 --> 00:37:38,758
So what this means
is when Deathstorm disappears,

566
00:37:38,841 --> 00:37:40,593
he's not just teleporting around town.

567
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:44,930
No, he is jumping back and forth
between points in dimensional space.

568
00:37:45,055 --> 00:37:47,016
I think I know what happened now.

569
00:37:51,312 --> 00:37:54,857
<i>When Ronnie's grief traveled
through that singularity,</i>

570
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:58,277
<i>it created Deathstorm.</i>

571
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:03,449
Only he's been trapped there,

572
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:08,454
trying to get back across the stars
to Caitlin ever since.

573
00:38:08,537 --> 00:38:10,977
And now that he's complete,
he can move back and forth between

574
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,210
that hell dimension and here, at will.

575
00:38:14,418 --> 00:38:18,005
All this time, we've been wondering why
Deathstorm would come after Caitlin

576
00:38:18,088 --> 00:38:19,548
seven years after Ronnie died.

577
00:38:19,882 --> 00:38:22,176
He's been searching for his plus-one
this whole time.

578
00:38:22,343 --> 00:38:25,012
It took him this long
because of how far he had to travel.

579
00:38:25,262 --> 00:38:29,391
So, a death monster
from another dimension,

580
00:38:29,517 --> 00:38:30,976
traveling through outer space

581
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:33,729
to find his death bride.
Yeah, it's official.

582
00:38:33,813 --> 00:38:35,564
I've heard everything now.

583
00:38:36,065 --> 00:38:38,234
Great Benjamin Banneker.

584
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,362
Trans-dimensional particles.

585
00:38:42,446 --> 00:38:44,198
Okay, now you're just making stuff up.

586
00:38:44,281 --> 00:38:45,741
No, no, no, look, now that I know

587
00:38:45,825 --> 00:38:48,577
that his powers
are literally from out of this world,

588
00:38:50,162 --> 00:38:52,042
it makes me think
that we need something cosmic.

589
00:38:52,623 --> 00:38:55,334
And folks, I know just the gadget
that we can augment

590
00:38:55,459 --> 00:38:57,461
and use to defend ourselves
against this thing.

591
00:39:01,549 --> 00:39:03,133
The Mental Augmentation Chamber.

592
00:39:03,217 --> 00:39:06,136
The MAC saved my ass
by absorbing the entire mass

593
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:10,724
of black hole energy that I accidentally
unleashed a couple years ago.

594
00:39:10,808 --> 00:39:11,888
I'm sorry about that again.

595
00:39:12,518 --> 00:39:15,688
And black holes are composed
of trans-dimensional particles.

596
00:39:15,771 --> 00:39:18,440
Exactly. Now, this is
going to sound a little nuts.

597
00:39:18,983 --> 00:39:23,445
But what if we adjust the MAC
so that instead of absorbing

598
00:39:23,612 --> 00:39:27,449
trans-dimensional energy,
it emits cosmic craziness instead.

599
00:39:27,533 --> 00:39:29,293
We'd finally be able
to fight fire with fire.

600
00:39:29,368 --> 00:39:30,368
Yeah.

601
00:39:31,579 --> 00:39:34,456
Yeah, but it's not like
we can just turn the MAC

602
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,792
into a portable cannon or shield.

603
00:39:38,919 --> 00:39:40,588
What we would really need is...

604
00:39:40,671 --> 00:39:43,632
A person to contain all the energy.

605
00:39:44,425 --> 00:39:45,968
Done and donner.

606
00:39:48,262 --> 00:39:50,407
Look, I don't speak geek,
but I understand enough to realize

607
00:39:50,431 --> 00:39:54,268
that you guys need an anti-Deathstorm
in order to take down the real thing.

608
00:39:54,643 --> 00:39:58,230
Frost and Deathstorm's powers
are both based on cold fusion.

609
00:39:58,856 --> 00:40:01,150
That could be the key
to pull this whole thing off.

610
00:40:01,483 --> 00:40:03,652
Yeah, but Frost, this is right up there

611
00:40:03,736 --> 00:40:06,456
with some of the most dangerous stuff
we've ever attempted as a team.

612
00:40:06,822 --> 00:40:08,240
We can't ask you to do this.

613
00:40:08,824 --> 00:40:11,827
You don't have to. It's like I told Mom.

614
00:40:12,286 --> 00:40:15,122
Dad created me for one reason,
to keep Caity safe.

615
00:40:16,206 --> 00:40:18,000
I was literally born for this.

616
00:40:24,381 --> 00:40:27,718
So, let's extinguish the son of a bitch.

617
00:41:26,735 --> 00:41:27,735
Iris.

618
00:41:29,905 --> 00:41:30,905
Thank God.

619
00:41:35,411 --> 00:41:36,912
It's so good to see you.
