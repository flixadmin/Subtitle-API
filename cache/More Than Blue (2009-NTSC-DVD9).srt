00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:46,737
Hey, Jung-sik?

7
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:47,981
How is it?

8
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:49,516
What do you think.

9
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:51,851
I need it for the drama next week

10
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:53,286
so tell him it's great!

11
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:55,121
Like Seung-chul ever listens to me.

12
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:58,424
Then make him. He's gotta do this song.

13
00:00:58,424 --> 00:01:01,723
But the lyrics are weak, man.

14
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:04,330
What the suits say
goes. That's show biz.

15
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,321
Whatever, man!

16
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:08,201
- Hold up!
- What is it?

17
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:09,335
You like this song?

18
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:10,570
Of course! Why?

19
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:14,174
Singing about a girl to
come back to me at my age?

20
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:16,876
My heart this and tears that...

21
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:17,877
Isn't it childish?

22
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:21,147
No! It's perfect! Don't you think?

23
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:21,848
It's great.

24
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:24,083
Make your fans really
feel the song, man!

25
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:26,085
But I don't feel anything!

26
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:29,789
You can do it, man. Feel me?

27
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:30,790
- It's great!
- No.

28
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,781
It's not working for me.

29
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:37,197
Seung-chul! Come on!

30
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:39,529
Get him!

31
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:40,929
Seung-chul!

32
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:42,600
Yes, director.

33
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:44,402

39
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:54,441
Nothing but the best
from LEE Seung-chul.

40
00:01:54,847 --> 00:01:56,382
Of course.

You always do this to me.

49
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:16,970
Please?

50
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,638

What about 'Hee-ya'?

54

'Hee-ya, please look at me.'

55
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:28,181
Give me a break.

56
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:30,817
That was a hit only cuz you sang it.

57
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,353
Wanna hear this song I got?

58
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:34,454
What is it?

59
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:36,856
It's off a flopped album.

60
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:39,058
Forget it, kid!

61
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:41,361
Let's hear it.

62
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:43,625
Really? Turn it on.

63

<i>To give you everything
and all my love...</i>

64
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:54,440
Who wrote this? The lyrics are great.

65
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,137
Really? Then let's ask
them to write our lyrics.

66
00:02:58,378 --> 00:02:59,746
Who wrote this?

67
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:03,216
Not sure. I got this off someone.

68
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:04,017
Who?

69
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,552
Min-chul. He used to
work for KIM Gap-sik.

70
00:03:06,552 --> 00:03:08,782
Gap-sik? I know him well.

71
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:13,825
Hey, didn't he leave the biz?

72
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,094
Who does your friend work for now?

73
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:17,363
He left the biz, too.

74
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:18,398
What does he do?

75
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:20,593
He runs a cafe in Chung-pyung.

76
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:23,494
Wanna go over, Seung-chul?

77
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:25,968
- Know where it is?
- Yes.

78
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:26,773
Lead the way.

79
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:29,333
<i>Director WON</i>

80
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:34,204
Got the album?

81
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:35,542
Ah, here.

82
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:39,617
What's the title?

83
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:41,515
It's the second track.

84
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:44,085
Second track?

85
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:51,631
'No one else like Thee' by Cream?

86
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:53,030
What's her real name?

87
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:57,967
I think it was EUN
Won. Yeah, that' s it.

88
00:03:58,204 --> 00:03:59,967
Got her number?

89
00:04:00,606 --> 00:04:01,607
She's gone.

90
00:04:01,607 --> 00:04:03,910
Gone? To where?

91
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,579
Right after KANG Chul-kyu left...

92
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:10,743
KANG knows her well?

93
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:15,712
Of course. He was
totally in love with her.

94
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,217
Do you have KANG's number?

95
00:04:19,992 --> 00:04:21,857
- He died.
- He's dead?

96
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,229
When?

97
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:26,721
About a month after
he married off EUN Won.

98
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,864
Mr. KANG!

99
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,430
What was the name of his show?

100
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:35,508
'Ugly Ducklings in Love'.

101
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:37,844
Yeah, that's it!

102
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:41,047
He married off the woman he loved?

103
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:43,914
- What does that mean?
- Well...

104
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:48,150
Tell us what happened.

105
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:51,518
It's a long story.

106
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:43,238
Hi, Chul-kyu!

107
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:59,323
<i>KANG said he saw stars</i>

108
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:00,693
<i>when he first met Cream.</i>

109
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,684
Why you little punk!

110
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:11,136
<i>Like he'd been slapped
on the back of his head.</i>

111
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:14,362
<i>He said it was love
at first sight.</i>

112
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:17,208
<i>Without even talking to her.</i>

113
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:19,903
<i>I asked,</i>

114
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:22,877
<i>'Shouldn't you at least
say a few words, first? '</i>

115
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,573
<i>Then he said...</i>

116
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:29,478
<i>If you need words,
then how can mutes love?</i>

117
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:46,806
How did you know my name?

118
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:51,038
Isn't it a waste living
in this big place alone?

119
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:55,843
Want me to live with you?

120
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:16,502
Think of a name for me,
and I'll make one for you.

121
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:18,595
We can't change our names.

122
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:20,496
Why not?

123
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:23,974
<i>Her name is Cream
and my name is K.</i>

124
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:26,879
<i>She was cold like ice cream,</i>

125
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:29,682
<i>- but also sweet like ice
cream. - The curtains won't do.</i>

126
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:30,883
We're changing everything.

127
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:33,477
<i>And she was
soft like ice cream.</i>

128
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:39,787
<i>And I'm not A, B, C,
D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K...</i>

129
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,854
<i>But just K.</i>

130
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:57,802
<i>We had a lot in common.</i>

131
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:02,237
<i>We were the same age.
We both liked noodles.</i>

132
00:08:04,216 --> 00:08:06,912
<i>We loved listening to
music on rainy days.</i>

133
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:10,816
<i>We loved coffee.</i>

134
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:15,590
<i>We hated school.</i>

135
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:21,896
<i>She liked me.</i>

136
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,902
<i>And I liked her.</i>

137
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:28,973
<i>And we were both orphans.</i>

138
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:34,413
<i>Prison and love...</i>

139
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:37,280
<i>Once you're stuck,
you can't get out.</i>

140
00:08:41,887 --> 00:08:45,448
<i>I fell in love with Cream.</i>

141
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:51,260
<i>Even the very air she breathed.</i>

142
00:08:57,837 --> 00:09:00,670
<i>Romeo must've been so worried...</i>

143
00:09:00,906 --> 00:09:05,707
<i>Ioving Juliet, but
afraid he might lose her.</i>

144
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:13,884
<i>Why did he drink the poison?</i>

145
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,450
<i>Perhaps he knew.</i>

146
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:22,261
<i>To love someone</i>

147
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:24,491
<i>- is to give her
everything. - I'll visit often.</i>

148
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:34,000
<i>I received so much from her
like the catcher who gets the ball.</i>

149
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:38,377
<i>Love was like dry ice.
Sometimes cold, sometimes hot.</i>

150
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:39,435
Wait!

151
00:09:39,578 --> 00:09:41,375
<i>Cream was so loveable.</i>

152
00:09:42,948 --> 00:09:49,148
<i>But I couldn't tell her
that I loved her.</i>

153
00:09:50,556 --> 00:09:57,792
<i>Cuz I had cancer cells in me
ready to strike at any time.</i>

154
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:06,300
<i>More than Blue</i>

155
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:45,277
Thank you, Mr. KIM.

156
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:48,748
It's the least I can do.

157
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:52,118
Writers need to eat well
to do all that thinking.

158
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:57,656
Have some soup with the
Kimbap and chew carefully.

159
00:10:57,656 --> 00:10:59,759
Is this your new singer?

160
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:06,187
Greet them, girl. They're
the best writers in SBC.

161
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:11,504
Hello, I'm Cat Girl. I
promise to sing my heart out.

162
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,699
Damn right you should.

163
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:16,041
Great outfit.

164
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:19,135
It's a new concept. She's a cat.

165
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,447
It's Cat Girl.

166
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:25,918
This gal's got brains.

167
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:29,021
She's a student at Seoul University.

168
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,682
Really?

169
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:34,026
It's Seoul University of Arts.

170
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,051
Who's side are you on?

171
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,831
You could get in trouble for
lying about schools these days.

172
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:43,335
If you're so holy, go be a cop instead.

173
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:44,393
Sorry.

174
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:49,071
Mr. Kang!

175
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:50,075
How are you?

176
00:11:50,075 --> 00:11:54,273
Here's Seung-chul's
new album. It's deep.

177
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:57,883
- It's a sure hit.
- I'm sure it's great.

178
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:58,951
- Say hi.
- Hello.

179
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:00,213
Call me K.

180
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,588
Let's go for drinks some time.

181
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:04,317
- Sounds great.
- Bye.

182
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:08,194
Seoul Univ. of Arts. Same difference.

183
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:09,495
That's right.

184
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:10,928
Did you eat, sir?

185
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,932
Mr. Kang!

186
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:15,234
- How've you been?
- I waited so long for you.

187
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:18,904
She's Cats. Damn, I keep forgetting.

188
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,997
It's Cat Girl, sir.

189
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:24,904
Go on and introduce yourself, girl.

190
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:29,815
I'm Cat Girl. I promise
to sing my heart out.

191
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:30,983
Thank you.

192
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:33,645
Of course you should.

193
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,889
Let's go some place
quiet to talk, Mr. Kang.

194
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:39,221
See you folks later.

195
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:44,029
- Come on, what are pals for.
- I can't.

196
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:47,965
It's just a show of my appreciation.

197
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:49,768
The album's finished?

198
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:53,472
I put together all the
best songwriters around.

199
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:56,703
You know me, I get what I want.

200
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:58,377
How is she?

201
00:12:58,377 --> 00:13:01,881
Oh, her? Not bad.

202
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:05,885
But she has trouble getting
along with the others.

203
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:08,220
Still she's got talent. Be nice.

204
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,815
Of course. Anything for you.

205
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:16,061
- But do this for me.
- I can't.

206
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:18,552
It's not much. Please, take it!

207
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:25,804
I can't sleep at the thought of you.

208
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:31,174
My dear love.

209
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:38,684
That part you just sang. Try
not to scream it this time.

210
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:40,675
You'll scare 'em off.

211
00:13:41,553 --> 00:13:44,317
How, sir?

212
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:51,029
How would you feel if someone
screamed they loved you?

213
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:56,700
You know, softly and
tenderly? You're good at that.

214
00:13:56,802 --> 00:14:01,398
What? Not that. Stop making me do it.

215
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:06,136
- That's not what I meant!
- Roll it!

216
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:17,520
What's she so good at?

217
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:21,518
Drop it will ya, man?

218
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,959
Come on. Just between us?

219
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:33,400
She's my future. That's
all I can tell ya, man.

220
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:39,075
Did you fix the second verse?

221
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,678
What?

222
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:43,413
The climax on the second verse.

223
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:45,846
'AIways like yesterday'?

224
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:49,112
It's a little corny, isn't it?

225
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:54,019
'A world without love? ' How's that?

226
00:14:56,996 --> 00:15:00,022
Like that's not corny?

227
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,867
It's just a suggestion.

228
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:12,968
Let's not get too excited here.

229
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:20,616
You two write it, then. I'm out.

230
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,685
What?

231
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,923
So feisty.

232
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:54,683
Do you have to become a singer?

233
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:57,178
What?

234
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:04,593
Got enough medication left?

235
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:22,272
My damn connection to your family.

236
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:29,612
First your father, now you.

237
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:34,517
There are too many illnesses
that can't be cured.

238
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:54,776
What's wrong?

239
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,149
What is it?

240
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:05,356
Don't cry.

241
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:07,882
Stop crying.

242
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:12,320
The bastards told me to rewrite it.

243
00:17:18,036 --> 00:17:22,029
'lf I could live again'.
How's that for the title?

244
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:25,173
'lf I could live again? '

245
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:31,177
If you could, what would
you like to be reborn as?

246
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:34,316
Besides a person?

247
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:37,049
Anything.

248
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:41,224
Well...

249
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:45,125
If I could live again...

250
00:17:48,066 --> 00:17:49,368
A ring?

251
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:50,767
Wait.

252
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,102
Start over.

253
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:04,843
If I could be born again...

254
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,415
A ring.

255
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:10,512
A pair of glasses.

256
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,651
A bed.

257
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,190
A diary.

258
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:20,832
Born again as things like
that? What fun is that?

259
00:18:20,832 --> 00:18:25,394
You can buy me. It'll
always be fun at your side.

260
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:29,173
So sensible.

261
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:31,599
Did you eat?

262
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:33,504
Of course, I did.

263
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:36,344
Well, I didn't.

264
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,281
Then let's eat.

265
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:47,692
Is there anything you want to tell me?

266
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:49,424
Like what?

267
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:53,298
A deep, dark secret?

268
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:57,564
Think of it as a confession
at a Catholic church.

269
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:01,366
I'll be the priest and listen.

270
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:04,309
A deep, dark secret?

271
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,914
Say anything. I'm ready to listen.

272
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:10,541
I like you.

273
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:17,688
I want to ask you something.

274
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:20,619
Do you have a wish?

275
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,418
A wish?

276
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:26,325
If you could have anything in the world?

277
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:29,190
First, hold up your spoon.

278
00:19:33,538 --> 00:19:35,199
Then?

279
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:37,902
Eat all your food.

280
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:48,377
Then?

281
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:50,885
Meet a great guy and get married.

282
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,353
Can't I marry you?

283
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,517
I'm not a great guy.

284
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:02,701
It wasn't my choice, but heaven's will,

285
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:06,071
to fall in love with you.

286
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:13,500
I was born to love you.
Heaven sent me to love you.

287
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:15,905
ID: Little Mermaid.

288
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:20,747
Now, for the requested song.

289
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:34,858
Your second toe is longer
than the first one like mine.

290
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:38,432
That means your mom will outlive you.

291
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:43,167
Who says that?

292
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:49,405
I think I read it somewhere.

293
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:51,405
It's a lie.

294
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,278
Why?

295
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:56,982
Cuz my Mom and Dad died on the same day.

296
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:01,716
If you...

297
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,556
If you die before me, I'll kill you!

298
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:15,429
<i>Here's another requested song.</i>

299
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:50,837
Are you finished?

300
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:54,803
Excuse me?

301
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,637
The coffee.

302
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,654
Then can I have the cup?

303
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:31,315
Which side did you drink from?

304
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,415
Pardon?

305
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,360
This isn't kissing, is it?

306
00:22:57,609 --> 00:23:00,442
- Hey.
- Yeah?

307
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:07,578
- You know the guest doctor?
- Yeah?

308
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,022
What kind of doctor is he?

309
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:13,783
Huh?

310
00:23:18,663 --> 00:23:22,463
We need to fill a cavity.
Amalgam is stronger than resin.

311
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,672
We kiss on the first day.

312
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:39,316
You see inside me, on the second day.

313
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,282
What should we do on the third day?

314
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:54,564
What?

315
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:58,596
We'll decide when the time comes.

316
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:09,671
I'm in love!

317
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:15,075
A guest on another show. He's a dentist.

318
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:23,023
Pass me the toothbrush?

319
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:34,499
You're listening to 'Happy Hour'.

320
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:37,936
- As you're out driving...
- Did you eat?

321
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:40,372
Oh, hi.

322
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:43,000
- Got a show to record, today?
- No.

323
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:48,241
The guest doctor on your show...

324
00:25:48,446 --> 00:25:52,212
Who? You mean CHA Joo-hwan?

325
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:54,285
How is he?

326
00:25:54,285 --> 00:25:57,379
He's a great guy. Why?

327
00:25:57,689 --> 00:26:00,725
Just wondering.

328
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:06,925
His family's rich, he's nice,
and he makes a ton of money.

329
00:26:07,098 --> 00:26:09,965
And he's a famous dentist.

330
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:13,435
You look a little sad today.

331
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:16,241
Good job, bro.

332
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,009
It was fun.

333
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:21,746
- Great show.
- Cut it short.

334
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:24,306
Hey, nice seeing you.

335
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:26,284
Let's go out for drinks.

336
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:28,687
Not if it's just a few drinks.

337
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:32,646
- How much then?
- All night?

338
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:34,224
All night! Alright!

339
00:26:36,194 --> 00:26:38,162
<i>What's his social
security number?</i>

340
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:42,400
<i>- 730313105...
- 730313...</i>

341
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:47,205
Sure you can get his medical records?

342
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:49,765
<i>Insurance companies
get everything.</i>

343
00:26:49,874 --> 00:26:52,243
<i>But why do you want
to check out a guy?</i>

344
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:53,945
I'll tell you later.

345
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:59,440
<i>Bingo! He's got life
and medical insurance.</i>

346
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:02,987
<i>No record of family illness
or any operations.</i>

347
00:27:02,987 --> 00:27:06,858
<i>He has an impeccable
health record.</i>

348
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:08,193
You sure?

349
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:10,595
<i>Insurance companies know
how to make money, man.</i>

350
00:27:10,595 --> 00:27:11,362
KANG!

351
00:27:11,362 --> 00:27:13,865
<i>If he has a hospital
record, we'll see it.</i>

352
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:14,899
KANG!

353
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:16,764
Thanks. I owe you one.

354
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,005
Got a minute Mr. KIM?

355
00:27:21,005 --> 00:27:23,872
For you, any time!

356
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:31,137
It's a gift.

357
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:37,353
Ah, thank you.

358
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:40,384
Just a thank you?

359
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:46,658
First my lips, then my insides...

360
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:49,826
Now, you're in my head.

361
00:27:50,401 --> 00:27:52,266
Buy me a drink?

362
00:27:58,243 --> 00:27:59,642
A drink?

363
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:03,576
I don't get it.

364
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:11,053
Who would've thought I'd use my
former dark roots to help you?

365
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:16,594
No need to worry. Now about Cats.

366
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:20,899
Man, I gotta change that name!

367
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:22,867
It's Cat Girl, sir.

368
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:28,032
I know! It's up here
but I can't say it right!

369
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:32,043
Call me whatever you want, hon.

370
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,807
Who cares if it's a cat or a dog?

371
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:38,947
That's my pretty.

372
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:42,118
My sweet Cats.

373
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:46,090
We're changing the name.

374
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:51,196
- Ah, sir?
- I said, I know!

375
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:53,391
Not that. The phone.

376
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:58,832
Sorry, Producer KANG! I checked and...

377
00:29:00,371 --> 00:29:03,738
You kids scram for a sec.

378
00:29:04,742 --> 00:29:07,336
I gotta take this call. Go!

379
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:14,919
CHA Joo-hwan's family's loaded!

380
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:18,523
He even has a hot fiancé.

381
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:21,890
He's got it made.

382
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:23,294
<i>Fiancé?</i>

383
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:26,195
Is something up?

384
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:35,766
Oh, you dropped your candy.

385
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:39,000
Let's put it in your pocket.

386
00:29:52,023 --> 00:29:54,116
Have you ever been in love?

387
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:59,357
Like a rock thrown into the river.

388
00:30:03,801 --> 00:30:05,393
Give me the ring.

389
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:06,828
Excuse me?

390
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:08,599
Your ring.

391
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:24,750
Like this.

392
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:42,834
Someone to pull you out. Like this.

393
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:47,473
I'm engaged.

394
00:30:57,422 --> 00:30:59,219
It doesn't matter.

395
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:00,786
Let's keep drinking.

396
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,893
It's so cold.

397
00:31:14,572 --> 00:31:16,540
Did you drink?

398
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:29,408
What do you like so much about him?

399
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:34,590
I feel like I'm being sterilized.

400
00:31:37,328 --> 00:31:39,421
Sterilized?

401
00:31:40,965 --> 00:31:42,489
Sterilized.

402
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:19,264
Perfect.

403
00:32:32,183 --> 00:32:35,118
- Let's eat.
- Sorry, I gotta run.

404
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:38,982
- You're not eating?
- I can't.

405
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:41,214
What about all this food?

406
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:43,193
You eat it all.

407
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:47,587
I'll see you later.

408
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:21,796
ABCDEFGHIJK...

409
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,397
Hello?

410
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:02,673
<i>Is this EUN Won's number?</i>

411
00:34:02,673 --> 00:34:06,370
Yes, it is.

412
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:09,336
<i>May I speak to her, please?</i>

413
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:11,344
She's not here.

414
00:34:13,751 --> 00:34:15,987
<i>My name's CHA Joo-hwan.</i>

415
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:18,456
<i>We were supposed
to meet today</i>

416
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:22,660
<i>but something came
up at the clinic.</i>

417
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:25,396
<i>Is there any way
I can reach her?</i>

418
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:27,830
Where were you going to meet?

419
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:11,807
So cold.

420
00:35:13,477 --> 00:35:14,637
Hey.

421
00:35:14,712 --> 00:35:16,145
He can't come.

422
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:17,775
Who?

423
00:35:17,848 --> 00:35:19,338
Him.

424
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:24,554
The doc.

425
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,661
Where are you going?

426
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:32,322
I gotta go.

427
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:36,122
Sit down. The curry here is great.

428
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:40,004
You know I don't eat curry.

429
00:35:40,004 --> 00:35:41,138
Then what do you want?

430
00:35:41,138 --> 00:35:42,273
What else is there?

431
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:44,264
What do you want to eat?

432
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:46,937
Kimbap.

433
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,674
So boring.

434
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:51,678
Just eat curry.

435
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:56,476
You're buying.

436
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:03,754
Come on Producer KANG. Spill it.

437
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:06,192
Did he rip you off or something?

438
00:36:06,397 --> 00:36:09,833
Then, why didn't you say so!

439
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:17,565
My boys can get the money
back before lunch in no time.

440
00:36:17,808 --> 00:36:19,332
It's not that.

441
00:36:19,443 --> 00:36:22,378
Then what is it?

442
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:28,177
Why would someone like you want
the dirt on some guy's fiancé even?

443
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:34,289
Are you interested in his fiancé?

444
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:37,087
Just find out, please.

445
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:38,855
Fine, then.

446
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:46,331
Anyway, Cats' album's
startin' to get noticed, now.

447
00:36:46,904 --> 00:36:49,707
Let's cook up something with your show

448
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:53,074
and sell 'em like hot pancakes!

449
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,146
I'm sure it'll do well.

450
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:56,909
Of course.

451
00:36:57,248 --> 00:36:58,613
Hey, Min-chul!

452
00:36:59,116 --> 00:37:00,811
Did you like the house?

453
00:37:01,252 --> 00:37:04,415
Mother said she liked it.

454
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,455
It's not bad.

455
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:09,021
I heard you stopped holding exhibitions.

456
00:37:09,593 --> 00:37:11,891
I'm tired of putting on shows.

457
00:37:13,597 --> 00:37:16,065
And there's nothing to take pictures of.

458
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:23,102
I'm sorry I'm not more fun to be around.

459
00:37:23,274 --> 00:37:27,938
Don't worry. I like
to have fun by myself.

460
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,441
That's sad.

461
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:36,311
- Let's have fun together from now on.
- Sure.

462
00:37:37,621 --> 00:37:40,954
Can I get an ashtray here?

463
00:37:41,325 --> 00:37:44,226
I'm sorry. There's no smoking here.

464
00:37:45,863 --> 00:37:48,457
The world's such a bore.

465
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:51,433
Get her an ashtray to
put that out, please.

466
00:37:51,535 --> 00:37:53,560
Yes, sir.

467
00:37:55,272 --> 00:37:56,899
Interesting.

468
00:37:57,241 --> 00:37:58,640
Keep smoking.

469
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:05,176
Should've known. She's
really somethin' all right.

470
00:38:05,883 --> 00:38:09,148
She's got men coming out of her ears.

471
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:12,823
I told 'em to take some good pics.

472
00:38:12,823 --> 00:38:14,024
It won't be long.

473
00:38:14,024 --> 00:38:17,661
<i>How did you pose
for your album cover?</i>

474
00:38:17,661 --> 00:38:20,931
I posed like I practiced
with my boss last night.

475
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:23,033
Exactly how?

476
00:38:23,033 --> 00:38:25,136
<i>- Here?
- Pardon?</i>

477
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:28,697
Men are all the same.

478
00:38:30,107 --> 00:38:31,699
Okay, then.

479
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:38,107
First, I open my eyes like a cat.

480
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:39,750
Like this.

481
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:42,319
- Ah, Cat Girl?
- Then...

482
00:38:42,319 --> 00:38:45,423
I hold my hands up and
open my mouth like this.

483
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:48,392
Look at her. She's a natural born star!

484
00:38:48,392 --> 00:38:50,155
You can just tell us.

485
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:53,063
But my boss said a star

486
00:38:53,063 --> 00:38:55,599
<i>- has to speak with
the body. - See that?</i>

487
00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:01,038
Girls like her adjust so quickly.

488
00:39:01,038 --> 00:39:04,633
That foxy babe. Who wouldn't love her?

489
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:10,080
- Ah, sir?
- KANG!

490
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,048
- What's wrong?
- KANG!

491
00:39:21,826 --> 00:39:23,657
Where is he?

492
00:39:26,597 --> 00:39:28,656
- Hey!
- I'm dead beat.

493
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:30,494
What's wrong with you!

494
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:32,459
What's with you!

495
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:36,302
Don't start.

496
00:39:38,342 --> 00:39:42,142
Why does he keep fainting like this?

497
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:47,451
It's hereditary, but it could also be

498
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:50,054
not enough calcium in his diet.

499
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:56,760
We've been eating the same food
in the same house for years!

500
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,228
Why are you the only
one who keeps fainting!

501
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:03,630
You eat way more than I do.

502
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:08,100
You're only eating anchovies
from now on, got that!

503
00:40:27,157 --> 00:40:28,647
You!

504
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:30,660
Yes?

505
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,752
What did he just say?

506
00:40:34,164 --> 00:40:37,930
To break off your engagement...

507
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:42,300
- Stop! Please!
- Who are you!

508
00:40:42,907 --> 00:40:46,673
What the hell are you trying to pull!

509
00:40:49,179 --> 00:40:52,876
You don't wanna mess with me!

510
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:56,950
Get the hell out of my sight!

511
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,723
I said, get lost.

512
00:41:26,717 --> 00:41:28,878
Why are you doing this?

513
00:41:30,287 --> 00:41:31,811
Huh?

514
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:36,953
You're a successful radio show producer.

515
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:40,528
Trailing a woman and
getting slapped like that.

516
00:41:41,765 --> 00:41:43,634
Aren't you embarrassed?

517
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:46,102
I don't have time to be embarrassed.

518
00:41:47,504 --> 00:41:50,064
What are you talking about?

519
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:55,208
One mountain after
another. But no time to go.

520
00:41:59,483 --> 00:42:01,644
Ow, my head.

521
00:42:04,121 --> 00:42:05,952
Does it hurt?

522
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,988
I'm hurt, too.

523
00:42:13,063 --> 00:42:15,327
What's with me today?

524
00:42:16,266 --> 00:42:18,257
It's cuz we're sad.

525
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:24,497
Then cry instead of making jokes.

526
00:42:25,142 --> 00:42:27,372
I don't want to cry.

527
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:31,445
Don't wanna make someone cry even more.

528
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:40,254
I'm dying. Just like my dad.

529
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:45,589
Chul-kyu!

530
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:55,764
<i>Mom left me a year
after Dad died.</i>

531
00:42:59,276 --> 00:43:02,177
<i>It probably wasn't
cuz she resented me.</i>

532
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,605
<i>She was sick of
everything cuz of Dad.</i>

533
00:43:07,584 --> 00:43:12,317
<i>I understand. I was
sick of everything, too.</i>

534
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:18,191
<i>But when she left me all alone...</i>

535
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,625
<i>I was so Ionely.</i>

536
00:43:25,335 --> 00:43:27,064
<i>People...</i>

537
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:30,172
should never be alone.

538
00:43:59,436 --> 00:44:01,028
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

539
00:44:02,172 --> 00:44:04,231
<i>I want you to leave your fiancé.</i>

540
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:07,678
<i>The girl that I love
is in love with him.</i>

541
00:44:07,678 --> 00:44:10,238
<i>- Medical records- The girl
that I love is in love with him.</i>

542
00:44:12,082 --> 00:44:13,674
<i>I beg you.</i>

543
00:44:21,725 --> 00:44:23,590
Under one condition.

544
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,098
But...

545
00:44:28,098 --> 00:44:29,656
But?

546
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:39,202
No, please! Tell me.

547
00:44:50,587 --> 00:44:52,817
I want to take your pictures.

548
00:44:55,959 --> 00:45:01,454
Your medical records said
you don't have much time left.

549
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:07,500
Now, that's an interesting model.

550
00:45:11,308 --> 00:45:13,572
I think it'll be fun.

551
00:45:13,777 --> 00:45:16,371
I don't think it'll be fun.

552
00:45:18,849 --> 00:45:20,783
Then the deal's off.

553
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:26,913
Drink up, first!

554
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:30,887
Give me a drink, too!

555
00:45:38,001 --> 00:45:40,868
- Hi! Hi!
- Hi! You're late!

556
00:45:45,442 --> 00:45:49,208
Hello. I spoke to you on the phone.

557
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,348
Oh, hi.

558
00:45:51,348 --> 00:45:52,610
I'm KANG Chul-kyu.

559
00:45:52,783 --> 00:45:54,045
CHA Joo-hwan.

560
00:45:54,151 --> 00:45:56,585
- Thanks again for that day.
- Anytime.

561
00:45:57,187 --> 00:45:58,552
You know him?

562
00:45:58,956 --> 00:46:00,321
The sterilizer?

563
00:46:03,393 --> 00:46:06,163
- Did you eat?
- No, I'll eat now.

564
00:46:06,163 --> 00:46:07,926
Why are you so late?

565
00:46:08,031 --> 00:46:10,465
- Still recording a show.
- What?

566
00:46:10,567 --> 00:46:12,035
You said you're done.

567
00:46:12,035 --> 00:46:14,560
Not yet. I gotta go back.

568
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:18,935
- Here.
- Thank you.

569
00:46:22,379 --> 00:46:25,177
The song's great.

570
00:46:26,183 --> 00:46:27,650
'lf I can live again'?

571
00:46:27,751 --> 00:46:29,810
Of course, I wrote it.

572
00:46:31,255 --> 00:46:33,655
Sorry, I gotta run.

573
00:46:33,724 --> 00:46:37,717
- Come on.
- Don't go.

574
00:46:37,828 --> 00:46:39,227
I'll see you later.

575
00:46:39,696 --> 00:46:40,822
Bye.

576
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:44,161
- See you next time, then.
- Sure.

577
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:51,031
Be careful in the snow!

578
00:47:35,217 --> 00:47:38,311
Why are you back so early?

579
00:47:38,453 --> 00:47:41,616
Aren't you supposed
to be recording a show?

580
00:47:42,691 --> 00:47:44,659
Change of plans.

581
00:47:44,893 --> 00:47:47,760
Me, too.

582
00:47:52,802 --> 00:47:54,429
Drink this.

583
00:48:01,177 --> 00:48:02,769
Didn't you eat?

584
00:48:03,079 --> 00:48:07,175
I did, but I'm still starving.

585
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:16,388
Why are you eating
noodles instead of rice?

586
00:48:16,659 --> 00:48:20,618
Just wanted something simple.

587
00:48:21,864 --> 00:48:23,161
It's good, huh?

588
00:48:26,369 --> 00:48:29,566
If you could stop time,
what would you do first?

589
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:36,634
If everyone else is frozen
and only you can move?

590
00:48:37,813 --> 00:48:41,112
If time stopped, you wouldn't die.

591
00:48:44,153 --> 00:48:45,950
Don't you want to live?

592
00:48:50,326 --> 00:48:52,089
Not talking to me?

593
00:48:54,630 --> 00:48:58,657
Too sorry to die and leave
the girl you love alone.

594
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:03,668
Okay, I can understand that much.

595
00:49:05,241 --> 00:49:06,868
But still...

596
00:49:08,677 --> 00:49:12,238
How can you marry her
off to someone else?

597
00:49:13,449 --> 00:49:16,543
Isn't that going overboard?

598
00:49:20,122 --> 00:49:22,522
You're not dead, yet.

599
00:49:24,693 --> 00:49:27,719
- How can you watch that?
- Ah, Jenna?

600
00:49:28,898 --> 00:49:31,628
Let's just stick to ourjobs.

601
00:49:32,034 --> 00:49:35,367
What's love?

602
00:49:42,745 --> 00:49:44,679
Like brushing your teeth.

603
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:46,845
Brushing your teeth?

604
00:49:48,184 --> 00:49:50,286
But you do that alone.

605
00:49:50,286 --> 00:49:52,584
Do you brush to show someone?

606
00:49:56,225 --> 00:49:58,785
Why didn't you come yesterday?

607
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:04,588
Pardon?

608
00:50:14,577 --> 00:50:17,068
I said, did you wait for me?

609
00:50:17,379 --> 00:50:24,410
Well, just wondering
why you didn't come.

610
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:27,614
You fell in love with me, didn't you?

611
00:50:27,957 --> 00:50:29,083
What?

612
00:50:29,091 --> 00:50:33,994
Love makes you wonder
and wait for that person.

613
00:50:35,297 --> 00:50:39,502
It's not that. If a patient
doesn't come, I wait.

614
00:50:39,502 --> 00:50:42,096
Do you wonder about every patient?

615
00:50:42,771 --> 00:50:44,295
Well...

616
00:50:45,541 --> 00:50:49,443
You're blushing. It's love all right.

617
00:50:51,447 --> 00:50:52,914
Hey, KANG Chul-kyu!

618
00:50:53,015 --> 00:50:54,573
Yes, boss.

619
00:50:54,783 --> 00:50:57,718
How much did you get from KIM Gap-sik?

620
00:50:59,121 --> 00:51:01,790
Should've been more discreet!

621
00:51:01,790 --> 00:51:04,350
Cat Girl's on your show 10 times a week!

622
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:07,429
Think people will stay still?

623
00:51:07,863 --> 00:51:13,631
Someone wrote in to audit your show!

624
00:51:13,802 --> 00:51:17,397
What's got into you all of a sudden?

625
00:51:17,506 --> 00:51:21,499
You of all people!

626
00:51:25,848 --> 00:51:27,941
When are you going to break it off?

627
00:51:28,984 --> 00:51:30,508
In a rush?

628
00:51:31,554 --> 00:51:33,545
You saw my medical records.

629
00:51:36,192 --> 00:51:38,558
I want to keep playing.

630
00:51:40,095 --> 00:51:44,589
But I guess you don't have that luxury.

631
00:51:49,738 --> 00:51:51,763
Under one condition.

632
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:00,314
Now, what.

633
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:03,414
I'll tell you after I break it off.

634
00:52:03,919 --> 00:52:06,114
A promise is a promise.

635
00:52:21,237 --> 00:52:24,832
Since when was it no smoking in here.

636
00:52:28,010 --> 00:52:29,807
No idea.

637
00:52:38,854 --> 00:52:42,881
Our parents will be shocked.

638
00:52:53,435 --> 00:52:59,875
I should be really angry
at a time like this, right?

639
00:52:59,875 --> 00:53:04,209
Yell at you or something?

640
00:53:07,082 --> 00:53:15,285
Funny, somehow I feel a little grateful.

641
00:53:17,526 --> 00:53:19,619
I'm going out for a smoke.

642
00:53:22,998 --> 00:53:24,363
So uncomfortable.

643
00:53:28,404 --> 00:53:30,167
My engagement's off.

644
00:53:38,781 --> 00:53:41,181
I don't have parents.

645
00:53:44,119 --> 00:53:47,646
I was studying late at high
school in my senior year.

646
00:53:48,857 --> 00:53:52,258
My homeroom teacher came
in and stared right at me.

647
00:53:52,528 --> 00:54:01,232
Like someone who came
to take me on death row.

648
00:54:02,705 --> 00:54:05,299
Like in the movies, you know?

649
00:54:06,675 --> 00:54:10,441
Anyway, he told me

650
00:54:10,713 --> 00:54:15,047
to go to the hospital right away.

651
00:54:15,384 --> 00:54:18,353
When I asked why...

652
00:54:18,587 --> 00:54:21,657
if he said my parents and

653
00:54:21,657 --> 00:54:25,093
sister died in a car accident...

654
00:54:25,627 --> 00:54:30,894
then I wouldn't have gone
and seen them like that.

655
00:54:32,801 --> 00:54:36,134
I see...

656
00:54:36,638 --> 00:54:39,368
K's been with me ever since.

657
00:54:40,342 --> 00:54:41,809
K?

658
00:54:44,046 --> 00:54:48,142
You saw him, Producer KANG Chul-kyu?

659
00:54:48,984 --> 00:54:52,818
His name sounds too corny
so I just call him K.

660
00:54:56,592 --> 00:55:00,824
At home, he's my Mom
At work, he's my Dad.

661
00:55:01,063 --> 00:55:03,258
When I'm sad, he's my brother.

662
00:55:04,032 --> 00:55:07,991
Sometimes he's like a lover.
Though he always chickens out.

663
00:55:09,605 --> 00:55:12,768
Can I kiss you?

664
00:55:14,476 --> 00:55:16,967
You wanna kiss me?

665
00:55:25,587 --> 00:55:26,952
Stupid.

666
00:55:28,257 --> 00:55:30,657
Let me see.

667
00:55:33,128 --> 00:55:34,186
Oh, no.

668
00:55:34,296 --> 00:55:36,321
That's right, I'm stupid!

669
00:55:45,207 --> 00:55:48,233
Open the door. Are you okay?

670
00:55:59,188 --> 00:56:01,418
<i>Don't look! Stupid!</i>

671
00:56:13,602 --> 00:56:15,695
<i>Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!</i>

672
00:56:43,665 --> 00:56:46,168
<i>I was born to love you.</i>

673
00:56:46,168 --> 00:56:50,229
<i>Heaven sent me to love you.</i>

674
00:56:52,174 --> 00:56:54,576
<i>Cat Girl's 'lf
I could live again'</i>

675
00:56:54,576 --> 00:56:56,737
<i>requested by
ID: Little Mermaid.</i>

676
00:56:56,912 --> 00:56:58,914
- You wrote this song, Cream?
- Yes.

677
00:56:58,914 --> 00:57:01,474
Let's hear, 'lf I could live again'.

678
00:57:10,759 --> 00:57:12,351
(Did you eat?)

679
00:57:14,463 --> 00:57:16,454
(I'm almost done!)

680
00:57:32,981 --> 00:57:34,550
Yes, boss.

681
00:57:34,550 --> 00:57:38,320
<i>Come to my office, now.</i>

682
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:39,617
Okay.

683
00:57:47,629 --> 00:57:50,996
Producer KANG!

684
00:57:52,701 --> 00:57:53,827
KANG!

685
00:57:54,136 --> 00:57:59,675
I heard everything. I'm going to
speak with the boss, right now!

686
00:57:59,675 --> 00:58:04,669
How can he fire a genius like you!

687
00:58:04,846 --> 00:58:06,748
I'm not getting fired.

688
00:58:06,748 --> 00:58:09,551
Same difference.

689
00:58:09,551 --> 00:58:12,247
- You can't go like this!
- I'm taking a break.

690
00:58:12,321 --> 00:58:17,960
Really? That's not what I heard.

691
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:21,589
I'm going to the States
to study for a while.

692
00:58:21,697 --> 00:58:28,865
Really? Guess there's
no use going to the boss.

693
00:58:29,638 --> 00:58:33,542
Thank you for everything, Mr. KIM.

694
00:58:33,542 --> 00:58:36,978
- Anytime. - You
too, Min-chul.

695
00:58:37,212 --> 00:58:40,477
Give him the demo tape, Min-chul.

696
00:58:41,717 --> 00:58:45,619
Producer CHOI! Hold on! Wait!

697
00:58:53,629 --> 00:58:55,256
Min-chul...

698
00:59:21,323 --> 00:59:22,585
It's a ballad.

699
00:59:23,091 --> 00:59:24,524
Write up a good song.

700
00:59:33,235 --> 00:59:34,930
What's marriage?

701
00:59:37,239 --> 00:59:38,729
Marriage?

702
00:59:39,174 --> 00:59:40,539
Marriage.

703
00:59:44,946 --> 00:59:47,540
- Marriage...
- Wait!

704
00:59:59,995 --> 01:00:02,054
A toothbrush holder.

705
01:00:03,131 --> 01:00:04,894
What?

706
01:00:05,667 --> 01:00:10,104
There's only one holder,
but many toothbrushes.

707
01:00:12,074 --> 01:00:14,474
What's that got to do with marriage?

708
01:00:14,743 --> 01:00:21,706
Being together as one like
toothbrushes in a holder.

709
01:00:25,287 --> 01:00:27,755
Then I must be married, already.

710
01:00:29,091 --> 01:00:32,583
Stupid! You can't be
married without a wedding.

711
01:00:35,297 --> 01:00:36,764
Really?

712
01:00:39,067 --> 01:00:40,557
I gotta pee.

713
01:01:09,765 --> 01:01:11,665
<i>No one else but Thee.</i>

714
01:01:18,173 --> 01:01:20,300
'Thee' is a lucky person.

715
01:01:24,045 --> 01:01:25,945
Wanna hear it?

716
01:02:00,081 --> 01:02:05,644
EUN Won and I living
together probably got to you.

717
01:02:06,555 --> 01:02:08,256
But there's nothing to worry about.

718
01:02:08,256 --> 01:02:09,917
I'm okay with that.

719
01:02:10,592 --> 01:02:16,360
I'm thankful for
everything you did for her.

720
01:02:16,631 --> 01:02:20,226
Let's get together often.

721
01:02:20,535 --> 01:02:22,867
Go on trips together and stuff.

722
01:02:23,538 --> 01:02:25,005
Sounds good.

723
01:02:26,842 --> 01:02:31,643
She says she wants to pick
out her wedding dress with you.

724
01:02:31,913 --> 01:02:33,642
Gotta love her wild ideas.

725
01:02:33,748 --> 01:02:35,773
Why me?

726
01:02:36,051 --> 01:02:39,782
I want what she wants.

727
01:02:42,691 --> 01:02:45,251
Please do it for her.

728
01:02:47,395 --> 01:02:56,133
And I hope it's the last
thing you ever do for her.

729
01:02:58,306 --> 01:03:01,969
Sure. Please take good care of her.

730
01:03:02,110 --> 01:03:06,206
Of course. She's my woman, now.

731
01:03:06,514 --> 01:03:07,879
Let's drink.

732
01:03:23,565 --> 01:03:25,123
What do you think?

733
01:03:31,273 --> 01:03:32,763
Very pretty.

734
01:03:36,311 --> 01:03:40,543
It's time for the groom-to-be
to try on his suit.

735
01:03:42,417 --> 01:03:43,852
I'm not the groom.

736
01:03:43,852 --> 01:03:45,444
Try it on.

737
01:03:54,129 --> 01:03:55,391
Come up here.

738
01:03:58,667 --> 01:04:02,660
Come here. Can you take a picture of us?

739
01:04:02,804 --> 01:04:06,331
On three. One, two, three!

740
01:04:15,083 --> 01:04:17,916
Wait out there. I'll
try on something else.

741
01:06:53,675 --> 01:06:56,200
Why are all the clocks stopped?

742
01:06:56,611 --> 01:06:57,908
No reason.

743
01:07:01,416 --> 01:07:03,782
Can I turn one on?

744
01:07:07,889 --> 01:07:09,322
Why?

745
01:07:10,091 --> 01:07:11,388
No reason.

746
01:07:13,328 --> 01:07:14,886
No reason?

747
01:07:16,197 --> 01:07:17,459
Sure.

748
01:07:43,458 --> 01:07:48,122
Jenna? I have a big favor to ask.

749
01:07:49,197 --> 01:07:50,664
What is it?

750
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:58,470
I need to send flowers on her
anniversary for a few years.

751
01:08:01,609 --> 01:08:05,545
She'll get suspicious, if
I lose touch altogether.

752
01:08:09,184 --> 01:08:11,948
I had one more condition. Remember?

753
01:08:14,956 --> 01:08:16,753
What is it?

754
01:08:39,647 --> 01:08:41,774
Please die at my side.

755
01:08:49,224 --> 01:08:52,489
You booked the tickets?

756
01:08:55,663 --> 01:08:58,325
I'm running low on battery.

757
01:08:59,968 --> 01:09:01,162
Hey.

758
01:09:03,605 --> 01:09:04,902
What are you making?

759
01:09:09,677 --> 01:09:12,669
My phone battery ran out.

760
01:09:13,348 --> 01:09:19,617
I'll charge it and call you back later.

761
01:09:19,787 --> 01:09:21,189
Bye.

762
01:09:21,189 --> 01:09:22,486
Hi.

763
01:09:26,995 --> 01:09:30,624
Why'd you leave me there like that?

764
01:09:31,766 --> 01:09:33,233
It's for you.

765
01:09:43,878 --> 01:09:45,641
Who do you think you are!

766
01:09:46,247 --> 01:09:47,976
What's with you?

767
01:09:48,149 --> 01:09:50,982
Who says you can touch my phone!

768
01:09:53,254 --> 01:09:55,085
The hell you...

769
01:09:58,359 --> 01:10:00,953
Who says you can do
whatever you want with me!

770
01:10:34,696 --> 01:10:35,993
Can I help you?

771
01:10:36,097 --> 01:10:37,724
Is K home?

772
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:40,927
K?

773
01:11:04,559 --> 01:11:06,322
Someone's here.

774
01:11:25,146 --> 01:11:29,640
She's pretty. I can
see why you love her.

775
01:11:31,052 --> 01:11:36,046
You think she's happy?

776
01:11:37,125 --> 01:11:39,025
What are you saying?

777
01:11:39,794 --> 01:11:41,853
She didn't seem happy.

778
01:11:43,931 --> 01:11:47,298
Can you send this for the next 3 years?

779
01:11:49,137 --> 01:11:50,570
It's pretty.

780
01:11:51,939 --> 01:11:53,804
Maybe too pretty.

781
01:11:57,078 --> 01:12:00,206
It looks fake. Like your love.

782
01:12:01,282 --> 01:12:03,216
Then what's real?

783
01:12:07,288 --> 01:12:08,721
Real?

784
01:12:11,192 --> 01:12:15,185
If you're hungry, you eat.
If you're hurting, you cry.

785
01:12:15,563 --> 01:12:20,557
If you're having fun, you
laugh. Not hold it in like you.

786
01:12:22,003 --> 01:12:24,631
You really wanna die like this?

787
01:12:27,375 --> 01:12:28,865
No!

788
01:12:31,078 --> 01:12:32,943
I don't want to die like this.

789
01:12:34,348 --> 01:12:36,543
I want to live a happy life.

790
01:12:39,187 --> 01:12:41,451
I want to be the one marrying EUN Won...

791
01:12:42,590 --> 01:12:44,615
...instead of him, tomorrow.

792
01:12:48,963 --> 01:12:50,430
But...

793
01:12:51,699 --> 01:12:53,360
That's just a dream.

794
01:12:54,035 --> 01:12:55,730
A sad dream.

795
01:12:59,140 --> 01:13:02,303
I'm done with dreaming.

796
01:13:57,632 --> 01:14:00,192
<i>Sleep tight and sweet dreams.</i>

797
01:14:20,521 --> 01:14:23,581
<i>Did you eat?
- Cream</i>

798
01:14:27,662 --> 01:14:28,993
Thanks.

799
01:14:48,215 --> 01:14:50,274
<i>I'm not talking to you.</i>

800
01:14:58,726 --> 01:15:00,250
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

801
01:15:07,301 --> 01:15:08,734
<i>For what?</i>

802
01:15:11,606 --> 01:15:13,164
<i>For everything.</i>

803
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:21,711
<i>I'm sorry, too.</i>

804
01:15:22,450 --> 01:15:23,747
<i>For what?</i>

805
01:15:24,852 --> 01:15:26,149
<i>For everything.</i>

806
01:15:29,457 --> 01:15:32,517
<i>I love you...</i>

807
01:15:36,631 --> 01:15:38,064
<i>I like you.</i>

808
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:40,731
<i>Me, too.</i>

809
01:18:02,276 --> 01:18:04,141
That's some story.

810
01:18:06,413 --> 01:18:09,746
KANG... amazing guy. I had no idea.

811
01:18:11,385 --> 01:18:17,813
Is there anyway to reach
them? What about the dentist?

812
01:18:24,198 --> 01:18:27,497
Wonder what happened to her.

813
01:18:34,775 --> 01:18:38,074
Let's record it.

814
01:18:39,914 --> 01:18:42,610
Really? I'll call right now.

815
01:18:42,783 --> 01:18:45,980
No, the other song.

816
01:18:47,321 --> 01:18:49,846
Oh, that song.

817
01:20:15,309 --> 01:20:17,077
I gotta go, I'm late.

818
01:20:17,077 --> 01:20:20,444
Get up and eat. I made breakfast.

819
01:21:18,038 --> 01:21:19,403
<i>What's this?</i>

820
01:21:20,641 --> 01:21:25,010
<i>Ah, Vitamin ABC. It
helps me get smarter.</i>

821
01:22:12,092 --> 01:22:15,220
Where'd you get these pills?

822
01:22:15,696 --> 01:22:17,891
They're my friends' pills.

823
01:22:18,599 --> 01:22:23,059
Since when did your
friend start taking this?

824
01:22:23,971 --> 01:22:25,495
Why?

825
01:22:26,173 --> 01:22:30,473
The pain must've been
severe to take these pills.

826
01:22:31,945 --> 01:22:33,037
What?

827
01:22:33,580 --> 01:22:39,109
They're painkillers for
patients with cancer or leukemia.

828
01:22:39,420 --> 01:22:41,479
<i>Terminal patients.</i>

829
01:22:42,790 --> 01:22:46,521
<i>Have you heard of
the hospice ward?</i>

830
01:22:47,461 --> 01:22:51,261
<i>It's where dying patients stay...</i>

831
01:22:51,698 --> 01:22:55,759
<i>with consent from their families.</i>

832
01:23:10,751 --> 01:23:12,013
Mom!

833
01:23:12,152 --> 01:23:14,755
Watch the house while we're out.

834
01:23:14,755 --> 01:23:17,155
See you later, sis!

835
01:23:23,330 --> 01:23:24,763
No!

836
01:23:49,490 --> 01:23:52,550
<i>When I found out what
Vitamin ABC really was...</i>

837
01:23:52,793 --> 01:23:56,661
<i>When I finally realized
what they were...</i>

838
01:23:56,897 --> 01:24:01,459
<i>When my whole world
turned pitch dark before me...</i>

839
01:24:01,902 --> 01:24:03,369
What's wrong?

840
01:24:03,604 --> 01:24:06,300
<i>I died before K.</i>

841
01:24:09,209 --> 01:24:16,945
<i>I met K a year after my
whole family passed away.</i>

842
01:24:18,685 --> 01:24:22,678
<i>Though almost 3 hours passed...</i>

843
01:24:24,024 --> 01:24:27,118
<i>he stood there frozen like stone.</i>

844
01:24:27,361 --> 01:24:30,964
<i>Crying and looking in the
direction his mother went.</i>

845
01:24:30,964 --> 01:24:35,765
<i>This will be enough to support you
till you're an adult, Chul-kyu.</i>

846
01:24:36,837 --> 01:24:42,935
<i>He looked sadder
and more hurt than me.</i>

847
01:24:44,378 --> 01:24:47,176
<i>He needed a hug
more than me.</i>

848
01:24:48,182 --> 01:24:50,446
Is there anything you want to tell me?

849
01:24:51,218 --> 01:24:52,742
Like what?

850
01:24:55,923 --> 01:24:59,620
A deep, dark secret?

851
01:25:02,296 --> 01:25:05,857
Say anything. I'm ready to listen.

852
01:25:07,467 --> 01:25:08,900
I like you.

853
01:25:09,203 --> 01:25:11,831
<i>Stupid idiot.</i>

854
01:25:12,439 --> 01:25:14,236
Do you have a wish?

855
01:25:14,341 --> 01:25:15,909
What's with you?

856
01:25:15,909 --> 01:25:19,037
Just curious all of a sudden.

857
01:25:20,781 --> 01:25:24,547
If you could do anything
you want in the world.

858
01:25:25,152 --> 01:25:27,143
<i>K is dying.</i>

859
01:25:27,487 --> 01:25:29,955
Meet a great guy and get married.

860
01:25:30,123 --> 01:25:31,992
Can't I marry you?

861
01:25:31,992 --> 01:25:34,187
I'm not a great guy.

862
01:25:34,361 --> 01:25:36,663
Then who is?

863
01:25:36,663 --> 01:25:40,565
Someone who is healthy and nice.

864
01:25:41,134 --> 01:25:43,625
Who knows how to take
care of his family.

865
01:25:44,838 --> 01:25:48,035
<i>I already met a great guy.</i>

866
01:25:48,875 --> 01:25:52,538
<i>But K told me to
meet someone else.</i>

867
01:25:53,013 --> 01:25:56,505
<i>He said that was his wish.</i>

868
01:25:58,085 --> 01:26:02,021
<i>KANG Chul-kyu</i>

869
01:26:05,692 --> 01:26:08,786
<i>When I heard K fainted...</i>

870
01:26:09,296 --> 01:26:13,062
<i>I rushed over,
afraid I'll go crazy.</i>

871
01:26:14,735 --> 01:26:16,532
<i>But I...</i>

872
01:26:17,471 --> 01:26:19,072
<i>... couldn't even go crazy.</i>

873
01:26:19,072 --> 01:26:21,074
No, doc.

874
01:26:21,074 --> 01:26:23,736
But she should know.

875
01:26:24,711 --> 01:26:27,202
What are you going to do?

876
01:26:27,914 --> 01:26:29,973
I don't know.

877
01:26:34,388 --> 01:26:37,289
It feels like a needle
stuck in my throat.

878
01:26:40,627 --> 01:26:42,356
Right here.

879
01:26:44,131 --> 01:26:46,258
It gets stuck right here.

880
01:26:47,734 --> 01:26:50,362
I can't say it.

881
01:26:52,072 --> 01:26:58,875
She'll live on. Think of yourself.

882
01:26:59,680 --> 01:27:02,080
She's different.

883
01:27:03,417 --> 01:27:05,510
She needs someone beside her.

884
01:27:20,834 --> 01:27:23,325
- Hello.
- There goes Mr. Perfect.

885
01:27:24,638 --> 01:27:27,038
Glowing from head to toe!

886
01:27:31,878 --> 01:27:34,142
<i>I picked a man.</i>

887
01:27:43,924 --> 01:27:46,085
Which side did you drink from?

888
01:27:49,196 --> 01:27:50,430
Pardon?

889
01:27:50,430 --> 01:27:52,830
I'm engaged.

890
01:27:53,367 --> 01:28:00,739
<i>Stupid. You think I care
whether you're engaged or not?</i>

891
01:28:02,042 --> 01:28:05,637
<i>Just play along and
meet me. For K.</i>

892
01:28:06,713 --> 01:28:08,738
<i>Am I a bitch?</i>

893
01:28:09,449 --> 01:28:11,952
<i>I don't have time
to worry about that!</i>

894
01:28:11,952 --> 01:28:14,318
<i>The man I love is dying!</i>

895
01:28:25,198 --> 01:28:31,000
<i>If I could be born again...
A ring? A pair of glasses?</i>

896
01:28:32,706 --> 01:28:36,802
<i>A bed? A diary?</i>

897
01:28:37,277 --> 01:28:40,974
<i>Born again as things like
that? What fun is that?</i>

898
01:28:41,248 --> 01:28:45,878
<i>You can buy me. It'll
always be fun at your side.</i>

899
01:29:01,902 --> 01:29:05,702
What's wrong? Are you okay?

900
01:29:07,808 --> 01:29:09,070
Let me see your hand.

901
01:29:16,450 --> 01:29:17,940
Where are you going?

902
01:29:37,671 --> 01:29:39,639
<i>I made a deal with myself.</i>

903
01:29:40,373 --> 01:29:42,841
<i>If he turns around,
I'd tell him everything.</i>

904
01:29:44,377 --> 01:29:48,746
<i>If he turns around, I'd
hug him and stop everything.</i>

905
01:29:50,484 --> 01:29:53,476
<i>But K didn't look back.</i>

906
01:29:54,821 --> 01:29:58,279
<i>And there was nothing
I could do.</i>

907
01:30:03,964 --> 01:30:06,432
Why are you eating
noodles instead of rice?

908
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:09,595
Just wanted something simple.

909
01:30:13,106 --> 01:30:15,700
- It's good, huh?
- Yeah.

910
01:30:19,779 --> 01:30:22,873
<i>As I sat eating the
noodles with him...</i>

911
01:30:24,050 --> 01:30:26,453
<i>I'd think, 'Don't
die you bastard'</i>

912
01:30:26,453 --> 01:30:29,320
<i>and drank some water instead.</i>

913
01:30:29,823 --> 01:30:34,590
<i>'Tell me. Let me hold you!
I'll die with you! '</i>

914
01:30:34,928 --> 01:30:39,388
<i>'I'll follow you and pay you back
for everything you did for me! '</i>

915
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:43,397
<i>Instead, I just drank the water.</i>

916
01:30:44,437 --> 01:30:47,065
<i>And finished the noodles.</i>

917
01:30:51,244 --> 01:30:56,876
There's only one holder,
but many toothbrushes.

918
01:30:58,485 --> 01:31:01,283
What's that got to do with marriage?

919
01:31:02,155 --> 01:31:08,719
Being together as one like
toothbrushes in a holder.

920
01:31:12,499 --> 01:31:14,797
Then I must be married, already.

921
01:31:16,269 --> 01:31:20,137
Stupid! You can't be
married without a wedding.

922
01:31:22,142 --> 01:31:23,632
Really?

923
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:56,240
Can we get married, soon?

924
01:32:21,668 --> 01:32:24,398
Wait out there. I'll
try on something else.

925
01:33:00,874 --> 01:33:02,967
The hell you...

926
01:33:05,979 --> 01:33:08,777
Who says you can do
whatever you want with me!

927
01:33:19,125 --> 01:33:20,717
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

928
01:33:27,367 --> 01:33:30,393
<i>I want to tell him I love him.</i>

929
01:33:30,804 --> 01:33:35,173
<i>I want to open my mouth
and say I love him.</i>

930
01:33:36,643 --> 01:33:40,511
<i>But I knew tears will fall
before I could say it.</i>

931
01:33:40,847 --> 01:33:44,248
<i>So I kept silent, again.</i>

932
01:33:57,630 --> 01:33:59,825
When are you going to talk to me?

933
01:34:01,334 --> 01:34:05,828
Didn't you hear me screaming
at you all this time?

934
01:34:06,439 --> 01:34:07,872
What?

935
01:34:09,375 --> 01:34:11,036
Stupid.

936
01:34:11,778 --> 01:34:13,712
I didn't hear anything.

937
01:34:14,748 --> 01:34:17,046
Then how can mutes love?

938
01:34:29,295 --> 01:34:31,092
I love you.

939
01:34:36,035 --> 01:34:37,502
Me, too.

940
01:35:02,228 --> 01:35:04,822
<i>We became a real couple.</i>

941
01:35:05,064 --> 01:35:07,191
<i>Cuz we made it down the aisle.</i>

942
01:36:39,459 --> 01:36:41,654
<i>Heaven's Gate Resting Place</i>

943
01:37:00,613 --> 01:37:01,739
Wait!

944
01:37:01,814 --> 01:37:03,179
You never learn!

945
01:37:04,284 --> 01:37:06,149
How can you write
with a brain like that?

946
01:37:15,395 --> 01:37:17,795
This isn't kissing, is it?

947
01:37:29,976 --> 01:37:31,534
Can you take a picture of us?

948
01:37:31,778 --> 01:37:34,212
On three. One, two, three!

949
01:37:36,115 --> 01:37:44,181
<i>I was born to love you.
Heaven send me to love you.</i>

950
01:38:43,583 --> 01:38:46,552
<i>- EUN
Won -</i>

951
01:38:46,719 --> 01:38:48,287
<i>I'm making noodles.
Want some?</i>

952
01:38:48,287 --> 01:38:50,356
<i>No, I gotta work.</i>

953
01:38:50,356 --> 01:38:51,724
<i>You sure?</i>

954
01:38:51,724 --> 01:38:53,487
<i>Yes, I'm working!</i>

955
01:38:53,593 --> 01:38:57,586
<i>- Then I'm just making
one! - Okay.</i>

956
01:38:58,464 --> 01:39:00,295
<i>Don't come beggin'later.</i>

957
01:39:00,433 --> 01:39:02,435
<i>- Hey!
- What?</i>

958
01:39:02,435 --> 01:39:05,598
<i>No eggs! Give me that.</i>

959
01:39:08,041 --> 01:39:10,566
<i>Wonder who invented noodles.</i>

960
01:39:10,777 --> 01:39:13,279
<i>You said you didn't want any.</i>

961
01:39:13,279 --> 01:39:14,871
<i>Changed my mind.</i>

962
01:39:15,782 --> 01:39:17,306
<i>Is there any rice?</i>

963
01:39:19,118 --> 01:39:22,349
<i>Hold on. There's
some in the fridge.</i>

964
01:39:23,556 --> 01:39:28,619
<i>Chul-kyu...
I'm coming to you.</i>

965
01:39:29,962 --> 01:39:32,430
<i>Don't worry.</i>

966
01:39:33,533 --> 01:39:37,867
<i>I trust you. You
were always my compass.</i>

967
01:39:39,605 --> 01:39:44,710
<i>Remember when I said
I can see you</i>

968
01:39:44,710 --> 01:39:47,907
<i>even when you're not with me?</i>

969
01:39:49,682 --> 01:39:52,014
<i>Go wherever you want.</i>

970
01:39:52,985 --> 01:39:55,818
<i>I'll find you, soon.</i>

971
01:39:57,723 --> 01:40:01,591
<i>Don't get mad when you see me.</i>

972
01:40:03,062 --> 01:40:10,662
<i>Don't ask me why I followed
you or get angry at me.</i>

973
01:40:12,038 --> 01:40:19,069
<i>After everything to come to
you, if you get mad I'll cry.</i>

974
01:40:20,413 --> 01:40:25,441
<i>When we meet again on the other
side, let's not cry again.</i>

975
01:40:25,618 --> 01:40:28,610
<i>Wait for me.
I'll be right there.</i>

976
