00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,295
Lt. Carapax, tell me
that you found Carabusul.

2
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,920
Cut it now

3
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:28,503
This thrilling!

4
00:01:28,586 --> 00:01:32,378
It's been working non-stop since I dug it up
two weeks ago.

5
00:01:32,461 --> 00:01:36,003
Good. Let's keep it a secret
until we present it to the board.

6
00:01:36,086 --> 00:01:39,211
Miss Kord. Miss Kord! Sorry.

7
00:01:39,295 --> 00:01:42,503
- Dr. Sanchez, hello!
- Hi! That's not my name.

8
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:46,836
- How long will it last?
- We reach the core before sunrise.

9
00:01:47,211 --> 00:01:48,711
Work harder!

10
00:01:49,211 --> 00:01:52,420
Am căutat 15 ani.
Nu vreau să mai aștept nicio secundă.

11
00:01:52,503 --> 00:01:55,128
I searched for 15 years.
I don't want to wait another second.

12
00:01:55,211 --> 00:01:56,503
Is there.

13
00:01:58,711 --> 00:02:00,461
I feel it.

Welcome to PALMERA CITY

VOTED #1 FOR LOWEST FEES

30
00:04:28,836 --> 00:04:30,586
Excuse me, sir! How do I look?

31
00:04:31,378 --> 00:04:33,253
Like you're 6 figures in debt.

32
00:04:35,128 --> 00:04:36,128
Good.

33
00:04:37,628 --> 00:04:39,503
(in italian)

34
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:45,170
You know. We're not saying anything for now.

35
00:04:45,253 --> 00:04:47,545
Let's enjoy this moment!
Before he found out.

36
00:04:47,836 --> 00:04:48,711
I tell him.

37
00:04:48,795 --> 00:04:49,795
(in italian)

38
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,003
What the hell? Why not?

39
00:04:52,086 --> 00:04:56,503
(in italian)

40
00:04:56,628 --> 00:04:58,086
And that's bad news.

41
00:04:58,378 --> 00:04:59,628
I can be happy.

42
00:05:00,086 --> 00:05:01,336
Your job is the balloon.

43
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,461
I hope I can handle it.

44
00:05:03,545 --> 00:05:04,545
What?

45
00:05:05,461 --> 00:05:08,711
Hey, the graduate is here!

46
00:05:09,753 --> 00:05:11,253
- How was the flight?
- Good.

47
00:05:11,336 --> 00:05:13,006
- Are you hungry?
- Sure.

48
00:05:13,007 --> 00:05:14,678
Here you go! That was all they had.

49
00:05:14,761 --> 00:05:15,710
A LITTLE BOY

50
00:05:15,711 --> 00:05:17,503
- Welcome back, brother!
- Thank you.

51
00:05:21,295 --> 00:05:23,253
(in italian)

52
00:05:23,586 --> 00:05:24,878
(in italian)

53
00:05:24,961 --> 00:05:25,961
Now we hug!

54
00:05:27,836 --> 00:05:29,378
Where's Uncle Rudy?

55
00:05:46,795 --> 00:05:49,545
That's it! Welcome, damned student!

56
00:05:49,628 --> 00:05:53,170
- Come down to hug me!
- Not. They're following us.

57
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:55,961
- There are rooms. Facial recognition.
- I knew you were going to say something.

58
00:05:56,045 --> 00:05:57,045
Body scans.

59
00:05:57,128 --> 00:05:59,420
Yes, and they are all happy
that I finally catch you

60
00:05:59,503 --> 00:06:02,378
See? This style of speaking
it's going to screw us all up.

61
00:06:02,461 --> 00:06:04,461
- Where did you get this?
- I got it for Jaime.

62
00:06:04,836 --> 00:06:07,104
A boy? We know it's a boy.
It probably has a microphone in it.

63
00:06:07,128 --> 00:06:08,503
Come on! What are you doing?

64
00:06:21,128 --> 00:06:24,795
God! How I missed it!

65
00:06:26,211 --> 00:06:28,711
It's good to know that some things
does not change.

66
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:31,490
Mom and Dad have something to tell you.

67
00:06:32,253 --> 00:06:33,753
- Miraculous.
- What the?

68
00:06:33,836 --> 00:06:36,503
He ate his taco,
now tell him the truth!

69
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,253
The truth? What is it?

70
00:06:39,711 --> 00:06:40,711
- We...
- We...

71
00:06:40,961 --> 00:06:41,961
We are losing our house.

72
00:06:42,795 --> 00:06:43,670
Ce?

73
00:06:43,753 --> 00:06:47,461
- Do you see? He didn't take it that badly.
- No, are we losing the house? What do you mean?

74
00:06:47,545 --> 00:06:51,670
- The owner tripled the rent.
- We give him the money in three months or we leave.

75
00:06:51,753 --> 00:06:53,711
I'm so sorry, flaquito.

76
00:06:53,795 --> 00:06:56,711
No. But don't worry!
It's not your fault.

77
00:06:56,795 --> 00:07:00,461
It just means you will have to
let's work hard at the service.

78
00:07:01,336 --> 00:07:02,545
The service is no more.

79
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:05,295
- How?
- Thank Kord.

80
00:07:05,378 --> 00:07:07,128
- Brother.
- I couldn't handle it.

81
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,420
Especially since your father...

82
00:07:09,503 --> 00:07:10,920
He had...

83
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:13,795
- A...
- Dad had a heart attack.

84
00:07:13,878 --> 00:07:14,795
Ce?

85
00:07:14,878 --> 00:07:16,086
I'm fine!

86
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,628
(in italian)

87
00:07:17,711 --> 00:07:19,420
(in italian)

88
00:07:19,795 --> 00:07:21,878
At least the food is the same.
No, cabezón?

89
00:07:21,961 --> 00:07:23,711
Wait, why didn't you tell me?

90
00:07:23,795 --> 00:07:26,128
You worked so hard, my love.

91
00:07:26,211 --> 00:07:28,503
We didn't want to disturb you from school.

92
00:07:28,586 --> 00:07:30,545
Mom, I could have done something.

93
00:07:30,628 --> 00:07:34,211
I could have turned back.
I could have been here. I could have...

94
00:07:34,295 --> 00:07:35,378
Cheer up, Jaime!

95
00:07:35,461 --> 00:07:38,461
We managed. We always do.

96
00:07:39,003 --> 00:07:41,836
We have a lot to be for
grateful. Mira...

97
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:44,003
(in italian)

98
00:07:44,086 --> 00:07:45,670
(in italian)

99
00:07:45,753 --> 00:07:47,461
Yes. And the last one!

100
00:07:47,545 --> 00:07:49,628
Yes, because you didn't sign up.

101
00:07:49,711 --> 00:07:51,628
To be in debt for life?

102
00:07:51,711 --> 00:07:52,711
No thanks.

103
00:07:55,836 --> 00:07:58,670
Ce? 25%?

104
00:07:58,753 --> 00:08:01,420
Mi amor, these people
he doesn't earn anything anymore.

105
00:08:01,961 --> 00:08:03,545
We are broke.

106
00:08:03,628 --> 00:08:06,045
Let's do it tomorrow
worry about money.

107
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:09,211
Welcome to EDGE KEYS

108
00:08:09,295 --> 00:08:11,711
OUT THE CORD

109
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:23,295
You remember how my mother used to teach us
salsa right here on the porch?

110
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:27,836
- You were always better than me.
- Know. You still don't know how to dance.

111
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,086
- Yes, I am hindered. I have nothing to do.
- Yes.

112
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:33,836
Do you remember your 21st birthday?

113
00:08:34,461 --> 00:08:36,086
I remember the first part.

114
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:38,628
I can't believe we're losing this place.

115
00:08:38,961 --> 00:08:40,128
It was hard.

116
00:08:40,961 --> 00:08:42,461
Yes, I won't go again.

117
00:08:44,045 --> 00:08:45,461
And college?

118
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,503
It won't help the family.

119
00:08:48,586 --> 00:08:50,420
I can't accumulate more debt.

120
00:08:51,128 --> 00:08:53,170
Cheer up, brother!

121
00:08:53,253 --> 00:08:55,670
You always fall on your feet.

122
00:08:55,753 --> 00:08:57,170
You are Jaime.

123
00:08:58,128 --> 00:08:59,711
Thanks, but...

124
00:09:01,795 --> 00:09:04,295
It wasn't meant to be, Mili.

125
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,378
What was supposed to happen?

126
00:09:06,461 --> 00:09:08,086
I had to leave.

127
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,461
Get us all out of here.

128
00:09:10,545 --> 00:09:12,878
Thanks bro, but I like it in the Keys.

129
00:09:15,003 --> 00:09:17,503
- You know what i mean.
- Yes.

130
00:09:20,045 --> 00:09:22,711
Don't mind me talking
about progress and they take everything,

131
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:25,045
while we impoverish here?

132
00:09:25,128 --> 00:09:28,128
You're Mexican in the Edge Keys, carnal.

133
00:09:28,211 --> 00:09:30,461
That progress is not for us.

134
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,586
Good? The poor stay here, the rich stay here,

135
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,920
until the rich come here and drive us out.

136
00:09:36,378 --> 00:09:39,420
I had the area behind the rails
and now they want that one too.

137
00:09:39,503 --> 00:09:41,045
I have a degree, right?

138
00:09:41,128 --> 00:09:42,378
It must matter.

139
00:09:42,461 --> 00:09:44,128
I'm going to get a job.

140
00:09:44,211 --> 00:09:46,628
Not just any, but a good one.

141
00:09:47,711 --> 00:09:49,461
Yes, I will make money
to save this place.

142
00:09:51,961 --> 00:09:54,920
Don't look at me like that!
Look, Mili...

143
00:09:55,003 --> 00:09:58,670
In five years, we'll be bathed in money.
This will be just one of our houses.

144
00:09:58,753 --> 00:10:00,920
We will have a villa on the water,

145
00:10:01,003 --> 00:10:03,711
with marble throughout, infinity pool.

146
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:07,420
Yes, you will see, Mili.

147
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,711
You'll see.

148
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,128
Excuse me, Mr. Reyes?

149
00:10:38,128 --> 00:10:40,378
Finished scraping the gum off the chaise longue?

150
00:10:43,586 --> 00:10:45,295
What crap!

151
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:49,295
Wow! "Thank you, Milagro,
for finding me this job! "

152
00:10:49,795 --> 00:10:52,670
It's not my fault that your future
it didn't turn out the way you wanted.

153
00:10:53,378 --> 00:10:56,086
How to experience
when no one gives me work?

154
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:57,628
That sounds like your problem.

155
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:01,878
Really?

156
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:04,128
What the? They give us work, newbie!

157
00:11:04,211 --> 00:11:07,836
Yes, I finally found it.
Dr. Sanchez is doing tests now.

158
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,670
With the code in hand,
we can pass the prototype phase.

159
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:11,795
Pay attention!

160
00:11:12,045 --> 00:11:13,586
Yes Yes.

161
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,128
Look at Victoria Kord.

162
00:11:15,211 --> 00:11:17,295
Look at that walk!

163
00:11:17,378 --> 00:11:21,545
She's sexy like Cruella,
Kardashian's.

164
00:11:22,295 --> 00:11:23,711
- I will greet her.
- Not...

165
00:11:23,795 --> 00:11:25,211
Hello ma'am!

166
00:11:25,295 --> 00:11:27,336
If you want, we could.

167
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,920
It's the discovery
which I was waiting for, general.

168
00:11:32,003 --> 00:11:34,586
We are invisible
for people like them, Jaime.

169
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,211
It's our superpower.

170
00:11:36,836 --> 00:11:38,753
Good. Back to work!

171
00:11:38,836 --> 00:11:42,086
Agree. It's a waste of time
but, general, I tell you,

172
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:46,378
what I'm going to show you tomorrow night
it will leave you alone.

173
00:11:46,461 --> 00:11:49,003
Yes. I can't wait too.

174
00:11:49,086 --> 00:11:50,086
Pa!

175
00:11:50,795 --> 00:11:52,253
Aunt Vicki.

176
00:11:56,545 --> 00:12:00,878
Jennifer, what are you doing here?
I didn't know you were coming.

177
00:12:00,961 --> 00:12:05,503
Carapax, she's Ted's daughter.
My favorite niece, Jennifer.

178
00:12:05,586 --> 00:12:09,836
So how do I get this unexpected pleasure?

179
00:12:12,753 --> 00:12:14,920
The world has changed.

180
00:12:15,003 --> 00:12:18,336
Kord Industries faces off
an unprecedented challenge,

181
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:23,003
to secure our goods
from here and abroad

182
00:12:23,086 --> 00:12:25,628
from our promethium mines
from Guatemala

183
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:30,170
to development projects
from Palmera City.

184
00:12:30,253 --> 00:12:34,461
ntroducing the future of private policing,

185
00:12:34,586 --> 00:12:38,545
OMAC, a man as much as an army.

186
00:12:39,378 --> 00:12:40,711
where are we going

187
00:12:40,795 --> 00:12:43,295
Gotta lighten up, bro.
I want you to hold six.

188
00:12:43,378 --> 00:12:45,211
The staff bathroom is there.

189
00:12:45,295 --> 00:12:48,961
Yes, I deserve to relieve myself in luxury now too.

190
00:12:49,045 --> 00:12:50,628
(in italian)

191
00:12:51,128 --> 00:12:52,128
Eu...

192
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:56,045
Using Kord symbiotechnology
revolutionary,

193
00:12:56,128 --> 00:12:59,295
OMAC connects directly to the human brain

194
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:02,420
to create
an autonomous warfare unit,

195
00:13:02,503 --> 00:13:06,961
allowing a single soldier
to have the power of legions.

196
00:13:07,795 --> 00:13:11,253
OMAC ensures safety
that Kord can count on.

197
00:13:11,961 --> 00:13:14,170
A future we can control.

198
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:17,253
OMAC-ul.

199
00:13:19,086 --> 00:13:20,836
It goes well, don't you think?

200
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:25,878
This project has been stopped
years ago.

201
00:13:25,961 --> 00:13:27,545
Why did you relaunch it?

202
00:13:27,628 --> 00:13:30,670
Jennifer, the OMAC
is the future of this company.

203
00:13:30,753 --> 00:13:32,086
You should be excited.

204
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:36,461
No no no. I really want to know
What's on Pago Island?

205
00:13:37,253 --> 00:13:38,586
This is top secret.

206
00:13:39,378 --> 00:13:40,586
It's a secret.

207
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:44,003
But I'll tell you what's not a secret:
what happens at this party

208
00:13:44,086 --> 00:13:47,045
It's going to be an amazing evening,
with very interesting people.

209
00:13:47,128 --> 00:13:50,045
If you want to come, bring someone
and it's going to be fun.

210
00:13:50,128 --> 00:13:51,503
Okay, see you later.

211
00:13:53,003 --> 00:13:55,128
I know what you're doing, Vicki.

212
00:13:55,253 --> 00:13:57,045
We don't make weapons anymore.

213
00:13:57,836 --> 00:13:59,753
We?

214
00:13:59,836 --> 00:14:02,170
Us, who?

215
00:14:02,253 --> 00:14:04,711
You are nothing in this company.
You are an expense.

216
00:14:04,795 --> 00:14:07,045
A treat on the spot
from her father's counsel,

217
00:14:07,128 --> 00:14:10,545
who travels for pleasure through the world
on company money...

218
00:14:10,628 --> 00:14:13,045
- doing "charity works".
- Dad wouldn't be...

219
00:14:13,128 --> 00:14:16,628
Your father got a company
built by me, my company,

220
00:14:16,711 --> 00:14:18,753
which he then buried

221
00:14:18,836 --> 00:14:22,586
with his stupid inventions
and reckless administration,

222
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,628
and after that you know what he did?

223
00:14:24,711 --> 00:14:28,670
He disappeared and left me
to gather the remains

224
00:14:28,753 --> 00:14:31,128
Your father abandoned this company.

225
00:14:32,795 --> 00:14:34,378
And he abandoned you.

226
00:14:34,461 --> 00:14:36,420
I won't let you do that.

227
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,878
Don't get in my way, Jennifer!

228
00:14:42,961 --> 00:14:44,378
Back off!

229
00:14:44,961 --> 00:14:46,420
I'm not afraid of you.

230
00:14:47,128 --> 00:14:48,836
Maybe you should be.

231
00:14:53,211 --> 00:14:55,711
He said back off ma'am.

232
00:15:00,086 --> 00:15:02,003
It was divine!

233
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:03,670
Oh damn!

234
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:08,836
And who are you, handsome?

235
00:15:09,461 --> 00:15:11,378
Jaime Reyes.

236
00:15:11,461 --> 00:15:15,378
I think it's time to find out
a new job, jaime reyes.

237
00:15:15,461 --> 00:15:18,170
- I...
- And you, toilet. Go away!

238
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,461
Thanks.

239
00:15:25,545 --> 00:15:26,920
where is the car

240
00:15:27,003 --> 00:15:28,545
47 minutes.

241
00:15:31,711 --> 00:15:33,545
Are you ok? That was...

242
00:15:33,628 --> 00:15:37,003
I appreciate the cavalry,
but I can take care of myself.

243
00:15:37,086 --> 00:15:41,336
Absolute. But what a pain, right?

244
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:44,003
It's a Kord. They are all impatient.

245
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:46,253
Jenny Kord.

246
00:15:48,128 --> 00:15:49,336
We are not all insufferable.

247
00:15:49,878 --> 00:15:52,128
Clar. From the.

248
00:15:52,628 --> 00:15:55,878
Look... I'm so sorry about that.

249
00:15:55,961 --> 00:15:57,086
It's fine.

250
00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:00,795
- Give me the phone, I'll give you my number.
- Good. Yes.

251
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,878
- Yes. Come to Kord Tower tomorrow.
- Good.

252
00:16:03,961 --> 00:16:07,003
I might be able to give it to you
a job in the company.

253
00:16:07,086 --> 00:16:08,795
Yes. God, that would be great!

254
00:16:08,878 --> 00:16:10,628
I'll do anything. Wow.

255
00:16:11,295 --> 00:16:12,670
Anything?

256
00:16:13,836 --> 00:16:15,253
You know he has a degree, right?

257
00:16:15,336 --> 00:16:17,170
- Right.
- I do.

258
00:16:17,253 --> 00:16:20,253
- Do you need lawyers?
- Good.

259
00:16:20,336 --> 00:16:22,420
- Message me!
- Good.

260
00:16:22,503 --> 00:16:25,878
I thought it was good, Jaime Reyes.

261
00:16:29,336 --> 00:16:30,503
Me too...

262
00:16:31,586 --> 00:16:32,670
Jenny Kord.

263
00:16:33,336 --> 00:16:34,795
I think he likes you.

264
00:16:35,795 --> 00:16:37,003
What the? Not.

265
00:16:37,711 --> 00:16:38,711
Pa!

266
00:16:39,753 --> 00:16:42,336
- Believe?
- Yes. Yes.

267
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:45,836
He took a look
at your young mexican ass

268
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,003
hero of the moment and he liked it.

269
00:16:49,086 --> 00:16:50,336
You know what?

270
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:53,461
Maybe it will get you out of poverty
as in María la del Barrio.

271
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:56,961
Except she's rich white
and you are María!

272
00:16:57,045 --> 00:16:58,420
Yes. Good.

Hey Jenny! This is Jaime Reyes.
I will accept your offer.

See you tomorrow.

Don't tell mom!

279
00:18:11,628 --> 00:18:12,920
You can not sleep?

280
00:18:13,878 --> 00:18:14,878
Not.

282
00:18:19,753 --> 00:18:23,461
I planted those nopales with nana,
when you were a baby

283
00:18:25,211 --> 00:18:26,503
Check them out now!

284
00:18:26,586 --> 00:18:30,253
Like you and Mili, big and beautiful.

285
00:18:33,461 --> 00:18:34,753
Are you ok?

286
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,711
And.

287
00:18:38,378 --> 00:18:42,128
I'm sorry, apá, it's just that everything now
seems unachievable and…

288
00:18:44,836 --> 00:18:46,420
I feel like I've disappointed you.

289
00:18:51,336 --> 00:18:53,086
We're on a journey, Jaime.

290
00:18:54,545 --> 00:18:58,461
Casa asta, nopales, the auto shop.

291
00:18:58,545 --> 00:18:59,878
Everything.

292
00:19:00,795 --> 00:19:03,211
I'm just a stop on that journey.

293
00:19:03,961 --> 00:19:06,378
But that is not the destination.

294
00:19:06,461 --> 00:19:07,836
But which one is it?

295
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,920
I do not know.

296
00:19:09,795 --> 00:19:13,295
The important thing is that we go
traveling together.

297
00:19:14,545 --> 00:19:16,753
Things don't last.

298
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:20,128
It's in the family forever.

299
00:19:20,211 --> 00:19:22,003
That remains.

Everyone has a purpose.

302
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:33,211
You just haven't found yours.

303
00:19:33,961 --> 00:19:35,670
So what is your goal?

304
00:19:37,545 --> 00:19:39,295
I'm still looking too.

305
00:19:41,086 --> 00:19:43,586

- It's Jaime, but...
- Here you go?

335
00:21:48,253 --> 00:21:50,128
Yes, I have a date.

- No, it's okay.

358
00:24:14,711 --> 00:24:16,753
But yesterday you said you were thinking
give me a job

359
00:24:16,836 --> 00:24:19,503
and I can't live without one,
although it sounds too...

360
00:24:19,586 --> 00:24:23,670
- Can you stop for a moment? Please...
- Jaime, this is really a bad time.

361
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:26,170
Good. Let's talk while you eat.

362
00:24:26,253 --> 00:24:27,336
Please...

363
00:24:28,211 --> 00:24:29,211
Keep in touch!

364
00:24:32,461 --> 00:24:34,295
- You said you'd do anything, right?
- Yes.

365
00:24:34,378 --> 00:24:36,545
- Basically, anything.
- Here you go!

366
00:24:37,336 --> 00:24:38,920
- Guard it with your life!
- Good.

367
00:24:39,003 --> 00:24:42,211
But don't open it! Don't touch it!
Don't even look at him!

368
00:24:42,295 --> 00:24:45,420
- Okay, I'll just defend him with my life.
- Yes, you learn quickly.

369
00:24:45,503 --> 00:24:46,795
- Yes.
- Good. Now go!

370
00:24:46,878 --> 00:24:48,461
- Good. Good!
- Go, go!

371
00:24:50,836 --> 00:24:53,503
Lock the southern entrances!
You two, with me!

372
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:04,586
Ok, let's go!

373
00:25:06,586 --> 00:25:07,920
Guard the outer gate!
​

374
00:25:14,545 --> 00:25:18,961
So you went to get us a job
and you only came back with a hamburger?

375
00:25:19,878 --> 00:25:21,211
I don't think it's a burger.

376
00:25:21,295 --> 00:25:22,670
Didn't you look?

377
00:25:22,753 --> 00:25:25,086
He said not to open it. I...

378
00:25:25,628 --> 00:25:26,670
- It's not here.
- What the?

379
00:25:26,753 --> 00:25:29,795
(in italian)

380
00:25:32,378 --> 00:25:34,711
Okay, okay, a look.

381
00:25:34,795 --> 00:25:37,253
You are so childish!

382
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:39,628
what the hell is that

383
00:25:40,624 --> 00:25:43,043
(in italian)

384
00:25:43,545 --> 00:25:44,878
Why was he hiding it?

385
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,420
I do not know.

386
00:25:48,878 --> 00:25:49,961
It's kind of disappointing.

387
00:25:50,045 --> 00:25:51,795
The biggest tick in the world.

388
00:25:52,461 --> 00:25:55,295
Okay, you guys wanted to see.

389
00:25:56,503 --> 00:25:59,503
Miraculous. Okay, look...
Very mature, but he said not to open it.

390
00:25:59,586 --> 00:26:02,336
- Please no...
- He said not to open it.

391
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,503
Finish!

392
00:26:05,545 --> 00:26:06,670
- It's tough.
- Good.

393
00:26:06,753 --> 00:26:07,670
I will use a motor.

394
00:26:07,753 --> 00:26:08,836
- I'm taking my drill.
- Stay!

395
00:26:09,211 --> 00:26:11,295
Leave the drill! What are you doing?

396
00:26:11,378 --> 00:26:13,128
God, I hate it when you do that.

397
00:26:15,753 --> 00:26:18,461
Is that the new Tamagotchi?

398
00:26:20,961 --> 00:26:22,670
How did you get him to do that?

399
00:26:22,753 --> 00:26:24,003
I do not know.

400
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,211
I think he likes me.

401
00:26:29,961 --> 00:26:30,961
What the hell?

402
00:26:33,003 --> 00:26:33,878
Do not like me!

403
00:26:33,961 --> 00:26:36,920
Jaime, it's on your face! It's on your face!

404
00:26:37,586 --> 00:26:38,795
Take it from me!

405
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:40,753
Alberto!

406
00:27:04,086 --> 00:27:05,086
What the hell?

407
00:27:12,378 --> 00:27:14,003
Where did he go? Where did he go?

408
00:27:14,503 --> 00:27:17,045
God! I'm trying to help you, cabezón!

409
00:27:17,128 --> 00:27:18,628
I think it's in me.

410
00:27:20,295 --> 00:27:21,753
God! It's in me!

411
00:27:22,211 --> 00:27:24,253
In you? How?

412
00:27:24,978 --> 00:27:26,480
(in italian)

413
00:27:40,753 --> 00:27:42,003
He's possessed!

414
00:27:53,461 --> 00:27:54,461
Dear good!

415
00:27:56,586 --> 00:27:57,670
James!

416
00:27:58,253 --> 00:27:59,420
Miracle!

417
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,295
James!

418
00:28:04,211 --> 00:28:07,503
Rudy, what's going on?

419
00:28:12,628 --> 00:28:13,461
Moves.

420
00:28:13,545 --> 00:28:14,795
- Jaime?
- Moves.

421
00:28:14,878 --> 00:28:16,836
No no no! Not!

422
00:28:21,461 --> 00:28:22,920
Damn it! Hell!

423
00:28:23,003 --> 00:28:24,795
It scared me because I did it myself.

424
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,211
are you ok mijo

425
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:33,170
Jaime.

426
00:28:51,836 --> 00:28:54,295
What the hell'...?

427
00:28:54,378 --> 00:28:56,628
Host acquired.

428
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:58,044
Who said that?

429
00:28:58,045 --> 00:29:00,128
System configuration initialization.

430
00:29:00,211 --> 00:29:01,295
Wait! Don't you hear that?

431
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:03,073
Don't look him in the eye!

432
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:04,378
Host analysis.

433
00:29:06,045 --> 00:29:08,170
I hear a voice in my mind.

434
00:29:08,253 --> 00:29:11,753
- Hi Jaime!
- What happens?

435
00:29:13,336 --> 00:29:16,461
- Checking systems in three...
- Checking systems?

436
00:29:16,545 --> 00:29:18,628
Two, one.

437
00:29:18,711 --> 00:29:19,961
Thrusters activated.

438
00:29:20,045 --> 00:29:22,336
It's fine. It will be okay!

439
00:29:31,461 --> 00:29:33,086
What are you doing?

440
00:29:33,961 --> 00:29:36,670
- What happens?
- Escape velocity activated.

441
00:29:36,753 --> 00:29:38,503
Where are you taking me?

442
00:29:38,586 --> 00:29:40,545
We cross atmospheric layers.

443
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,670
- Stop!
- Pressure adjustment for host.

444
00:29:48,545 --> 00:29:51,753
Ay, virgencita, I'm in space.
I'm in space.

445
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,420
God, I'm in space!

446
00:30:00,461 --> 00:30:03,045
What the heck is happening?

447
00:30:03,128 --> 00:30:05,878
- Wait, is that my house?
- Testing re-entry systems.

448
00:30:05,961 --> 00:30:07,545
Wait, wait! No no no!

449
00:30:14,086 --> 00:30:16,128
No no no!

450
00:30:17,628 --> 00:30:20,420
God! Oh God! I caught fire!

451
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:23,836
Stop it! Oh God!

452
00:30:24,878 --> 00:30:26,295
Fly! Fly!

453
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,128
- Not. No no no.
- We are approaching contact.

454
00:30:32,211 --> 00:30:34,086
- God, I'm going to die!
- 300 m.

455
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:36,378
200 m.

456
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:38,920
100 m.

457
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,753
Full brake system check.

458
00:30:43,836 --> 00:30:45,670
Thank God it's over!

459
00:30:45,753 --> 00:30:47,461
Okay, you can take me home now.

460
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:48,920
Flight systems activated.

461
00:30:49,003 --> 00:30:50,920
Wait, wait, wait... Don't activate them!

462
00:30:51,836 --> 00:30:53,961
Stop, stop!

463
00:30:57,753 --> 00:30:58,670
Hear me out!

464
00:30:58,753 --> 00:31:00,253
You got the wrong person!

465
00:31:00,336 --> 00:31:03,753
I swear! I'm nobody!

466
00:31:07,128 --> 00:31:08,961
Oh come on!

467
00:31:12,086 --> 00:31:13,878
Testing acceleration systems.

468
00:31:13,961 --> 00:31:15,461
Too fast! Too fast!

469
00:31:21,545 --> 00:31:23,045
Careful! Careful!

470
00:31:23,628 --> 00:31:24,920
What was that?

471
00:31:25,003 --> 00:31:26,211
I don't know what I'm doing!

472
00:31:29,003 --> 00:31:30,170
I'm sorry about that.

473
00:31:30,878 --> 00:31:32,295
Flight control adjustment.

474
00:31:35,961 --> 00:31:37,211
Take care! Take care!

475
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:39,253
Pick up! Pick up!

476
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:43,003
Why are you doing this?

477
00:31:43,086 --> 00:31:47,128
- The host overreacts.
- Exaggerated? You kidnapped me!

478
00:31:50,661 --> 00:31:53,121
(in italian)

479
00:31:54,003 --> 00:31:55,211
20 minutes ago, I think.

480
00:31:55,295 --> 00:31:57,003
- Does it work for you?
- Not.

481
00:31:57,086 --> 00:31:58,878
- Because I don't have it.
- Not.

482
00:31:59,003 --> 00:32:00,836
- Does it work for you?
- No, man.

483
00:32:06,753 --> 00:32:08,045
My back!

484
00:32:08,628 --> 00:32:10,753
Full landing systems check.

485
00:32:13,295 --> 00:32:14,975
- Are you OK?
- What did you do to my car?

486
00:32:15,045 --> 00:32:16,378
Do you have insurance, man?

487
00:32:16,461 --> 00:32:17,545
I was sick of the trouble.

488
00:32:17,628 --> 00:32:19,253
A threat is approaching.

489
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,086
What the hell?

490
00:32:42,795 --> 00:32:44,711
Oh no! What you did?

491
00:32:44,795 --> 00:32:46,836
Successful host protection.

492
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,045
Look, did anyone get hurt?

493
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:50,420
Oh no! Calm down! I can explain.

494
00:32:50,503 --> 00:32:51,878
Do not worry!

495
00:32:51,961 --> 00:32:54,920
Oh my God, look a child!
It wasn't me, I swear.

496
00:32:55,003 --> 00:32:56,961
It will seem crazy,
but i'm not in control...

497
00:32:57,045 --> 00:32:58,711
Full systems check.

498
00:32:59,503 --> 00:33:01,003
Oh no, not again!

499
00:33:08,003 --> 00:33:09,420
I think it worked.

500
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:16,045
Let me explain myself one more time.

501
00:33:16,128 --> 00:33:19,378
Basically, she's not a missing person,
but it disappeared.

502
00:33:19,461 --> 00:33:22,086
- But it's also...
- Possessed!

503
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:28,253
It shot through the roof.
With rockets behind.

504
00:33:28,336 --> 00:33:30,045
Shouldn't we be looking for him?

505
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:34,670
And I'm waiting.

506
00:33:36,836 --> 00:33:38,586
Successful return landing.

507
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:40,545
Leave it! I found him.

508
00:33:42,981 --> 00:33:44,525
(in italian)

509
00:33:45,836 --> 00:33:48,961
Come on, hide those huevos!

510
00:33:49,071 --> 00:33:50,155
(in italian)

511
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:51,836
(in italian)

512
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,545
(in italian)

513
00:33:53,628 --> 00:33:55,211
It's Jamie, not Jaime.

514
00:33:57,586 --> 00:33:58,795
Oh no!

515
00:34:14,378 --> 00:34:15,670
What are you doing?

516
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,934
(in italian)

517
00:34:19,586 --> 00:34:22,795
Jaime. Are you feeling good, mijo?

518
00:34:25,503 --> 00:34:28,795
Not. No way.

519
00:34:30,003 --> 00:34:31,086
Jaime, listen!

520
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:33,170
- Do you have something on...
- Not now, Milagro.

521
00:34:33,253 --> 00:34:35,086
- I'm serious.
- Not now, Milagro.

522
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:36,336
- Not now!
- Have something...

523
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:39,420
Jaime, hold that blanket now
that chorizo touched you.

524
00:34:39,503 --> 00:34:40,586
What happens?

525
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:42,420
You can't fly.

526
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:45,670
You can't fly. Superman flies.

527
00:34:45,795 --> 00:34:48,003
Those on the bus were fine.

528
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:52,420
Good. That probably
that happens all the time.

529
00:34:52,503 --> 00:34:56,836
Yeah, they shouldn't do this to me.
Yes. Good.

530
00:35:04,253 --> 00:35:05,253
I tried to tell him.

531
00:35:06,378 --> 00:35:10,128
I need to find Jenny Kord.
She'll know how to get this out of me.

532
00:35:10,211 --> 00:35:11,836
where are my shoes

533
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,336
Come on, where are my... shoes?

534
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,336
Not basketball!

535
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,128
They were my favorites.

536
00:35:19,211 --> 00:35:20,586
Good good.

537
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:23,920
- Jaime, what happened? Where did you go?
- Well, I don't know.

538
00:35:24,003 --> 00:35:26,170
I think I cut a bus in half and...

539
00:35:26,253 --> 00:35:28,128
- What the?
- I flew into orbit.

540
00:35:28,253 --> 00:35:30,003
- Cómo que flew into orbit?
- Well, I don't know.

541
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:31,771
- That's why I have to find Jenny Kord.
- I'll call the police.

542
00:35:31,795 --> 00:35:33,836
No no. Don't call the police!

543
00:35:34,461 --> 00:35:36,336
He works for Kord.

544
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,836
What do you think Kord will do
when will he realize it

545
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:42,670
that a Mexican kid is like that
of military technology in it?

546
00:35:43,711 --> 00:35:45,170
They will close it.

547
00:35:45,253 --> 00:35:48,003
And they're going to wipe our brains,
not to tell anyone.

548
00:35:48,086 --> 00:35:50,526
And it's not like when the government
he's not used to locking up mexicans.

549
00:35:50,586 --> 00:35:53,628
We are talking about sci-fi. We're talking about the CIA.

550
00:35:53,711 --> 00:35:58,336
- From Area 51!
- Rudy, focus! What do you want to say?

551
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:02,336
I say that the government and Kord
she'll be riding us

552
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:04,378
and after that they will ask for documents.

553
00:36:04,461 --> 00:36:07,295
And you, nana. And to you, Alberto.

554
00:36:08,336 --> 00:36:10,545
Okay, then I'll go alone.

555
00:36:10,628 --> 00:36:13,670
- Don't leave this house!
- Well, I'm 22 years old!

556
00:36:13,753 --> 00:36:16,003
- And if he's in danger?
- In danger?

557
00:36:16,086 --> 00:36:18,545
- Jaime, you flew through the roof.
- You do not understand.

558
00:36:18,628 --> 00:36:20,545
- She likes it.
- Absolutely.

559
00:36:20,628 --> 00:36:22,003
I do not like it.

560
00:36:22,086 --> 00:36:23,812
- Followed his Instagram account.
- Where is...?

561
00:36:23,836 --> 00:36:25,753
She's Brazilian.
Lives at Regent Tower.

562
00:36:25,836 --> 00:36:27,961
And she's single, by the way.

563
00:36:28,045 --> 00:36:30,503
A bit lonely, in my opinion.

564
00:36:30,586 --> 00:36:31,961
is she alone

565
00:36:32,045 --> 00:36:33,711
You didn't seem to like it.

566
00:36:33,795 --> 00:36:35,755
- What are you doing with my phone?
- You left it unlocked.

567
00:36:35,821 --> 00:36:37,614
(in italian)

568
00:36:37,698 --> 00:36:39,658
(in italian)

569
00:36:39,741 --> 00:36:42,077
(in italian)

570
00:36:41,846 --> 00:36:42,877
Yes, he is Maria.

571
00:36:42,878 --> 00:36:45,045
Yes, I said the same thing.
But María la del Barrio.

572
00:36:45,163 --> 00:36:46,456
(in italian)

573
00:36:47,249 --> 00:36:49,418
(in italian)

574
00:36:49,543 --> 00:36:51,837
(in italian)

575
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,839
(in italian)

576
00:36:54,214 --> 00:36:57,551
(in italian)

577
00:36:57,628 --> 00:36:59,628
- Do you hear that, dude?
- Rudy!

578
00:37:04,295 --> 00:37:05,586
Not. No no.

579
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:08,003
Not. Not. Not!

580
00:37:08,086 --> 00:37:09,086
James!

581
00:37:09,128 --> 00:37:13,128
Not! Not! Not!

582
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:16,111
(in italian)

583
00:37:16,711 --> 00:37:18,628
Don't be silly! Rudy!

584
00:37:31,045 --> 00:37:33,586
What a scratch!

585
00:37:34,045 --> 00:37:35,045
Good.

586
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:39,795
You can not!

587
00:37:40,545 --> 00:37:42,128
What the...?

588
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:44,753
Wait, what...?

589
00:37:45,753 --> 00:37:46,753
Jenny?

590
00:37:48,378 --> 00:37:49,378
Oh God!

591
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,836
What are you doing here?

592
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,253
- Let it go, I'm coming!
- Who?

593
00:37:53,628 --> 00:37:54,628
They!

594
00:37:55,586 --> 00:37:57,295
- Oh God! Good!
- Come on! Come on!

595
00:37:57,378 --> 00:37:59,045
Good good. Oh God!

596
00:37:59,128 --> 00:38:01,878
- I told you to go!
- You should have said they have guns.

597
00:38:03,253 --> 00:38:04,461
Take care!

598
00:38:09,128 --> 00:38:10,586
Rudy is going to kill me!

599
00:38:15,211 --> 00:38:17,420
My headlights!

600
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:19,503
Not! My mirrors!

601
00:38:19,795 --> 00:38:21,211
what the hell man

602
00:38:22,795 --> 00:38:25,586
What's up with you? Cabezón!

603
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:27,128
do you want some water

604
00:38:27,211 --> 00:38:30,211
- My tailgate!
- No thanks.

605
00:38:30,295 --> 00:38:31,420
Good.

606
00:38:33,836 --> 00:38:35,628
What did you do with Taco?

607
00:38:36,295 --> 00:38:38,711
- He's Rudy too.
- My name is César, okay?

608
00:38:38,795 --> 00:38:40,795
And only my friends call me Rudy.

609
00:38:40,961 --> 00:38:43,461
- I'm Jenny.
- “I'm Jenny. ” Hi Jenny!

610
00:38:43,545 --> 00:38:45,711
We know who you are. What are you doing here?

611
00:38:45,795 --> 00:38:48,170
You are thinking of making this house
a nuclear plant?

612
00:38:48,253 --> 00:38:50,961
I went swimming near the waves
does your family have company

613
00:38:51,045 --> 00:38:53,711
My testicles are seven times bigger.

614
00:38:53,795 --> 00:38:55,961
You shouldn't loot cobalt

615
00:38:56,086 --> 00:38:58,545
from a developing country Jenny?

616
00:38:59,586 --> 00:39:01,336
- Where is it?
- Yes.

617
00:39:02,253 --> 00:39:03,628
Let me!

618
00:39:04,378 --> 00:39:05,961
Rudy! What the?

619
00:39:06,045 --> 00:39:07,670
- What are you doing?
- Rudy!

620
00:39:10,628 --> 00:39:12,628
I thought chingaderas was going to come out.

621
00:39:12,795 --> 00:39:13,961
- To leave?
- God!

622
00:39:14,045 --> 00:39:16,253
- What is he talking about?
- About it.

623
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:19,836
I forgot how bad it looks.

624
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:23,197
(in italian)

625
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,197
(in italian)

626
00:39:23,253 --> 00:39:24,253
I've seen worse.

627
00:39:24,961 --> 00:39:26,628
- Where?
- You do not want to know.

628
00:39:26,711 --> 00:39:28,461
Okay, what the hell is this thing?

629
00:39:28,545 --> 00:39:30,211
It's called Carabus.

630
00:39:30,295 --> 00:39:33,003
Dad got it when I was little.

631
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,753
It's a kind of weapon
destroyer of worlds.

632
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,270
How pretty!

633
00:39:37,295 --> 00:39:39,295
- Weapon?
- What did he say?

634
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,920
What the?

635
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:43,086
And you knew what was going to happen
with my brother

636
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:45,836
when you gave him this gun
destroyer of worlds?

637
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,820
No, I swear I had no idea.

638
00:39:47,821 --> 00:39:48,835
It's like this...

639
00:39:48,836 --> 00:39:51,503
Dad said it can't be activated
by anyone.

640
00:39:51,586 --> 00:39:53,086
They have to choose you.

641
00:39:54,295 --> 00:39:58,503
- I guess he chose you.
- No more meetings with strangers.

642
00:39:58,586 --> 00:40:02,628
- Good. And how do we make them stop choosing me?
- I do not know.

643
00:40:02,836 --> 00:40:04,211
But we'd better get moving

644
00:40:04,295 --> 00:40:06,420
because my aunt
he's going to kill us just to get him.

645
00:40:06,503 --> 00:40:07,628
Will it kill us?

646
00:40:07,711 --> 00:40:09,062
I am not sorry.
I didn't mean that.

647
00:40:09,086 --> 00:40:10,836
She sent the assassins.

648
00:40:12,621 --> 00:40:14,456
(in italian)

649
00:40:15,836 --> 00:40:18,461
I'm sorry I put you in this situation.

650
00:40:18,586 --> 00:40:22,378
I didn't know it would activate.
Even. I did not know.

651
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:25,461
- How convenient!
- He already said he didn't know.

652
00:40:25,545 --> 00:40:27,586
It's a Kord! Do you really trust her?

653
00:40:29,586 --> 00:40:33,128
We will find a solution.
We always do.

654
00:40:33,711 --> 00:40:36,503
Come on, we're the Reyes family.

655
00:40:37,003 --> 00:40:39,170
We have faced harder things.

656
00:40:39,253 --> 00:40:40,253
Yes?

657
00:40:42,753 --> 00:40:45,795
Cheer up! We can do this.

658
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:49,170
Yes. Yes, father.

659
00:40:49,253 --> 00:40:50,670
Is right.

660
00:40:50,753 --> 00:40:55,503
Okay, so how are we going to get this out of me?

661
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:57,920
Before they give us another hole in the house.

662
00:40:58,003 --> 00:40:59,295
Exact.

663
00:41:00,211 --> 00:41:02,836
There is a place
where we could find answers.

664
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:07,586
- But we need the key.
- Okay, and where's the key?

665
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:12,295
In the Kord building. And they probably are
on alert since I took Carabus.

666
00:41:12,378 --> 00:41:15,878
So what are we talking about?
Laser based security systems?

667
00:41:15,961 --> 00:41:18,253
Moving image detection
on large areas, maybe?

668
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:19,836
Photonic emitters?

669
00:41:20,961 --> 00:41:23,586
- Not really...
- Because I worked on something...

670
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:26,961
what I think would help us
and it's almost done.

671
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:30,503
If I get the mechanical structure.

672
00:41:30,586 --> 00:41:31,461
I love you mom.

673
00:41:31,545 --> 00:41:33,211
Give me a few hours!

674
00:42:03,711 --> 00:42:05,420
Are you aware that
if you do the OMAC,

675
00:42:05,503 --> 00:42:08,086
you will be the strongest
arms manufacturers in the world.

676
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:10,753
Invest and you can tell me what you want.

677
00:42:10,836 --> 00:42:13,086
That I was talking about the wolf...

678
00:42:14,086 --> 00:42:16,336
General, he is Lt. Carapax.

679
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:19,128
It was crucial
for prototype development,

680
00:42:19,211 --> 00:42:22,253
and I personally chose it
for his courage

681
00:42:22,336 --> 00:42:27,753
during anti-terrorist operations,
anti-communists from Guatemala.

682
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:32,211
It's the perfect container for OMAC,
and a product of the School of the Americas.

683
00:42:32,295 --> 00:42:34,378
Nice to meet you, lieutenant.

684
00:42:35,086 --> 00:42:38,003
I can't wait to see him in action.

685
00:42:38,711 --> 00:42:39,795
When it will be done?

686
00:42:39,878 --> 00:42:43,753
It's ready, right?
We just have a few more details to finish.

687
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:45,628
We have a problem.

688
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:47,961
Excuse us!

689
00:42:48,045 --> 00:42:51,461
Smoke a cigar!
They are made by real Cubans.

690
00:42:53,253 --> 00:42:55,711
have you lost it How?

691
00:42:56,170 --> 00:43:00,795
- Someone helped her.
- I want to know who he is working with now.

692
00:43:01,086 --> 00:43:04,086
Because, without Carabus,
we cannot complete the OMAC.

693
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:06,795
I take care I'm going to bring the Carabus back.

694
00:43:07,836 --> 00:43:11,003
- This time, I will do it personally.
- I hope so, Carapax.

695
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:15,003
Otherwise, all your sacrifices
they will have been in vain.

696
00:43:15,086 --> 00:43:18,753
Think about how much suffering
your body passed.

697
00:43:18,836 --> 00:43:21,086
I am aware of what you did to them.

698
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:24,170
God! What we did to him.

699
00:43:24,878 --> 00:43:28,628
Ignacio, I'm on your side.

700
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:33,753
You don't remember what it was like
when did i find you

701
00:43:34,336 --> 00:43:36,711
How stupid were you?

702
00:43:37,336 --> 00:43:38,920
How broken?

703
00:43:40,545 --> 00:43:44,170
I'm trying to fix you.

704
00:43:44,586 --> 00:43:45,670
Good?

705
00:43:48,961 --> 00:43:49,961
Good.

706
00:43:50,003 --> 00:43:52,086
I have to get back to the party.

707
00:43:53,961 --> 00:43:55,961
Bring me that Carabusa!

708
00:44:05,586 --> 00:44:06,753
That's it?

709
00:44:07,378 --> 00:44:10,170
I call him El Chapulín.

710
00:44:11,545 --> 00:44:12,545
Why?

711
00:44:13,503 --> 00:44:17,086
You know, when you do something cool,
you can call it whatever you want.

712
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:19,628
Please make yourself useful! Hold this!

713
00:44:20,795 --> 00:44:21,795
Are you sure it works?

714
00:44:22,628 --> 00:44:24,253
Thank you. Yes.

715
00:44:24,336 --> 00:44:28,253
Unlike the crap made
by Kord, my technology works.

716
00:44:28,378 --> 00:44:32,170
- You could just say yes.
- Good. Sweetie, do you hit the switch?

717
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,461
- The yellow one.
- I did it.

718
00:44:37,753 --> 00:44:41,211
Good. At least I don't have to open it
that annoying tailgate.

719
00:44:41,295 --> 00:44:42,586
Enter at your own expense.

720
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,961
Make some room!

721
00:44:45,045 --> 00:44:46,420
I have to give it a…

722
00:44:50,086 --> 00:44:51,586
- That's sexy!
- That's great!

723
00:44:51,961 --> 00:44:54,503
That's great! So it goes.

724
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:57,586
Yes, it works.

725
00:44:57,670 --> 00:44:58,753
I'll keep the engine running.

726
00:44:59,336 --> 00:45:00,336
Come on!

727
00:45:01,295 --> 00:45:04,086
Mira nomás. "So it works"?

728
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:08,295
guys...

729
00:45:10,128 --> 00:45:11,128
Something is happening.

730
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:18,003
what the hell is this

731
00:45:24,711 --> 00:45:29,378
Join me and my little friends,
and Kord branches...

732
00:45:29,461 --> 00:45:30,378
The key is here.

733
00:45:30,461 --> 00:45:34,670
Worldwide,
to build a better future.

734
00:45:35,336 --> 00:45:37,211
A future Kord.

735
00:45:39,628 --> 00:45:41,295
She looked so different then!

736
00:45:42,211 --> 00:45:45,295
Vicki and my grandfather founded
Kord Industries together

737
00:45:46,211 --> 00:45:48,420
and they transformed it
in a military power.

738
00:45:49,086 --> 00:45:51,461
Then when my grandfather died,

739
00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:54,378
Victoria thought she would get the company.

740
00:45:55,503 --> 00:45:58,336
But he left everything to my father.

741
00:45:59,086 --> 00:46:00,836
- It seems somewhat...
- Sexist?

742
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:03,461
Yes.

743
00:46:04,086 --> 00:46:08,003
But dad wanted a different direction
for the company.

744
00:46:08,086 --> 00:46:11,836
So Victoria became obsessed
to erase my father's legacy.

745
00:46:13,628 --> 00:46:15,170
can you help me here

746
00:46:16,295 --> 00:46:18,128
Yes, sorry. what do you need

747
00:46:18,211 --> 00:46:19,711
- Hold this!
- Good.

748
00:46:20,295 --> 00:46:23,378
A signal is jamming our transmission.
We are jammed.

749
00:46:27,086 --> 00:46:29,628
Lt. Carapax, we have a problem.

750
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:39,628
- Is that the key?
- Yes.

751
00:46:41,545 --> 00:46:43,586
- Ok, let's go!
- Let's go!

752
00:46:46,836 --> 00:46:49,295
TED CLOCK
PROTOTYPE DESIGNED BY TED KORD

753
00:46:56,586 --> 00:46:58,961
That's why I don't let anyone drive Taco!

754
00:47:00,670 --> 00:47:04,336
Honestly, I didn't think Chapulín would go.

755
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:07,086
Yes, that's right Rudy.
It's like a Mexican Doc Brown.

756
00:47:07,170 --> 00:47:08,420
Really?

757
00:47:08,503 --> 00:47:09,863
- Good.
- Is that all you need?

758
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,170
- Yes.
- Dear good!

759
00:47:12,253 --> 00:47:14,878
I don't know why I thought so
that it will be much harder.

760
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:16,795
Oh damn!

761
00:47:17,461 --> 00:47:19,961
The car, now!

762
00:47:20,045 --> 00:47:21,295
what is he doing here

763
00:47:23,295 --> 00:47:26,503
Let's run away? Don't slow down.
Take care!

764
00:47:40,628 --> 00:47:42,211
God! how did you do that

765
00:47:42,295 --> 00:47:43,711
I have no idea.

766
00:47:48,586 --> 00:47:50,461
He got angry.

767
00:48:07,795 --> 00:48:09,503
What the hell is that thing?

768
00:48:09,586 --> 00:48:10,753
the OMAC.

769
00:48:13,295 --> 00:48:15,253
You will regret this.

770
00:48:16,295 --> 00:48:17,711
Host defense.

771
00:48:17,795 --> 00:48:19,920
God! Quick! Go to Rudy's!

772
00:48:20,003 --> 00:48:22,545
- Attacking the threat.
- Attack? Not!

773
00:48:24,545 --> 00:48:25,878
Oh damn!

774
00:48:30,253 --> 00:48:32,420
Okay, wait, wait! No, no, wait! Not!

775
00:48:35,586 --> 00:48:38,003
What did you do that for?
I told you not to attack.

776
00:48:48,795 --> 00:48:50,711
I have an arsenal at my disposal.

777
00:48:50,795 --> 00:48:51,878
Not! No weapons.

778
00:48:56,295 --> 00:48:57,878
It's my song too!

779
00:48:59,836 --> 00:49:00,836
- Caesar!
- What the?

780
00:49:01,295 --> 00:49:02,961
- What the hell, where is the cabezón?
- There!

781
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,253
Hey! Calm down!

782
00:49:13,003 --> 00:49:14,920
- Damn it! Go! Go! Go!
- C'mon C'mon!

783
00:49:20,253 --> 00:49:21,378
I will talk to him.

784
00:49:21,461 --> 00:49:24,170
Verbal communication is not recommended
in a combat scenario.

785
00:49:24,253 --> 00:49:26,628
Man, I think this is just a misunderstanding...

786
00:49:28,878 --> 00:49:32,545
I didn't mean to hit you.
I swear I wouldn't...

787
00:49:33,253 --> 00:49:34,836
I don't control this thing.

788
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:37,128
No, let me explain!

789
00:49:38,128 --> 00:49:39,586
Leave! Do not listen.

790
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:41,420
Permission to take over the host.

791
00:49:41,503 --> 00:49:42,753
Yes! Anything!

792
00:49:51,878 --> 00:49:53,503
Watch and learn, Jaime!

793
00:49:55,628 --> 00:49:57,045
Where are you going?

794
00:49:57,128 --> 00:49:58,128
Come on!

795
00:49:59,086 --> 00:50:00,295
What the hell?

796
00:50:10,503 --> 00:50:12,545
Oh God! My hands are weapons.

797
00:50:16,545 --> 00:50:18,253
Threat neutralized.

798
00:50:19,336 --> 00:50:20,545
What's with the swords?

799
00:50:23,878 --> 00:50:25,086
Elimination of the threat.

800
00:50:25,170 --> 00:50:26,961
No no no. Put down the swords!

801
00:50:27,045 --> 00:50:29,045
Would you like to use another weapon?

802
00:50:29,128 --> 00:50:31,170
Not. No need to kill him.

803
00:50:31,253 --> 00:50:34,003
- Elimination of the threat.
- You are listening to me?

804
00:50:34,086 --> 00:50:35,503
Elimination of the threat.

805
00:50:35,586 --> 00:50:37,420
Stop it! I'm not a killer.

806
00:50:37,961 --> 00:50:39,503
Order accepted.

807
00:50:43,628 --> 00:50:44,545
Cabezón!

808
00:50:44,628 --> 00:50:45,961
James!

809
00:50:46,628 --> 00:50:47,628
Uncle Rudy.

810
00:50:49,878 --> 00:50:50,878
Not!

811
00:50:51,836 --> 00:50:52,836
God!

812
00:50:54,253 --> 00:50:55,461
Rudy!

813
00:50:56,503 --> 00:50:58,545
Where do you think you're going?

814
00:51:00,253 --> 00:51:02,586
You have to get out of here!

815
00:51:07,586 --> 00:51:09,170
What's with this guy?

816
00:51:09,995 --> 00:51:11,044
What the?

817
00:51:11,045 --> 00:51:12,503
Stupid boy!

818
00:51:12,586 --> 00:51:14,086
Do you think you could beat me?

819
00:51:15,253 --> 00:51:16,920
I recommend lethal measures.

820
00:51:17,003 --> 00:51:19,378
I told you, I'm not...

821
00:51:20,253 --> 00:51:22,420
Warning: Concussion detected.

822
00:51:32,586 --> 00:51:35,378
You should have liquidated me
when you had the chance.

823
00:51:36,795 --> 00:51:38,045
It's going to kill him.

824
00:51:46,628 --> 00:51:49,503
Not. He won't do it.

825
00:51:49,795 --> 00:51:50,795
Hold on!

826
00:51:54,170 --> 00:51:57,795
Please don't hurt my family.

827
00:51:57,878 --> 00:52:02,461
Love to your family
makes you weak

828
00:52:02,545 --> 00:52:04,420
Caesar! What are you doing?

829
00:52:04,503 --> 00:52:05,795
Okay, Kord girl,

830
00:52:05,878 --> 00:52:08,878
when i tell you
pull hard on the handbrake!

831
00:52:10,295 --> 00:52:11,855
- Are you ready?
- God, this is crazy!

832
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:15,336
Three, two, one.

833
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:16,420
Now!

834
00:52:25,836 --> 00:52:27,920
Cabezón, let's get out of here!

835
00:52:38,586 --> 00:52:41,045
It's good? James! James!

836
00:52:41,128 --> 00:52:43,045
Jenny! Snap out!

837
00:52:43,128 --> 00:52:44,961
- Good.
- Do not look!

838
00:52:45,045 --> 00:52:46,670
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

839
00:52:48,836 --> 00:52:50,170
I'm fine, Rudy. Thank you.

840
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:55,378
Good. All right.

841
00:52:55,461 --> 00:52:56,461
God...

842
00:52:57,170 --> 00:52:59,378
That psychopath was going to kill me.

843
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:03,670
Did you get the key?

844
00:53:04,170 --> 00:53:05,003
- All right.
- Yes.

845
00:53:05,086 --> 00:53:07,753
Good. Now let's take it out
The nerd in you.

846
00:53:08,253 --> 00:53:09,586
Khaji- Yes.

847
00:53:10,295 --> 00:53:11,961
The Carabao's name is Khaji-Da.

848
00:53:12,461 --> 00:53:13,461
How do you know?

849
00:53:14,545 --> 00:53:16,420
Something happened there.

850
00:53:16,503 --> 00:53:19,170
I can feel it in my mind. Is it crazy?

851
00:53:21,128 --> 00:53:22,670
Become symbiotic.

852
00:53:23,253 --> 00:53:25,003
- What the?
- Okay, where now?

853
00:53:27,211 --> 00:53:28,670
- Take that exit!
- What the? Stay!

854
00:53:28,753 --> 00:53:29,753
No no no!

855
00:53:32,503 --> 00:53:34,753
Does anyone know how to drive in this town?

856
00:53:48,211 --> 00:53:50,003
Won't he look for you here?

857
00:53:50,086 --> 00:53:52,420
There was no one here
since I was eight years old.

858
00:54:15,795 --> 00:54:17,795
Yes I understand. Makes sense.

859
00:54:23,211 --> 00:54:26,003
So your dad was obsessed with ghosts?

860
00:54:30,003 --> 00:54:31,045
Where we are?

861
00:54:36,836 --> 00:54:37,920
You can not!

862
00:54:40,586 --> 00:54:41,920
Stay!

863
00:54:42,003 --> 00:54:44,545
Was Ted Kord Blue Beetle?

864
00:54:47,670 --> 00:54:49,211
What the hell is Blue Beetle?

865
00:54:49,295 --> 00:54:52,336
You were a child. He's Palmera's superhero.

866
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:55,503
Like Superman in Metropolis
and Flash in Central City.

867
00:54:55,628 --> 00:54:56,878
But...

868
00:54:57,378 --> 00:55:00,503
I don't know, maybe not as good.

869
00:55:01,586 --> 00:55:03,836
I can't believe it was Blue Beetle.

870
00:55:04,378 --> 00:55:05,545
But I understand.

871
00:55:05,961 --> 00:55:09,211
Eccentric billionaire, a genius.

872
00:55:11,503 --> 00:55:14,378
Your father was a great man.
I did not know.

873
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:18,336
You can call me César or Rudy.
As you wish, I don't care.

874
00:55:19,253 --> 00:55:20,878
How about all this...?

875
00:55:23,003 --> 00:55:25,461
- Are you ok?
- Yes.

876
00:55:26,336 --> 00:55:28,128
What were you saying?

877
00:55:28,211 --> 00:55:33,003
- How come these don't look anymore...?
- Beautiful? Less ridiculous?

878
00:55:33,086 --> 00:55:34,836
No, but I mean...

879
00:55:36,670 --> 00:55:39,586
Look at this!
It's like Batman's...

880
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:42,461
if he had ADHD.

881
00:55:42,545 --> 00:55:43,836
Batman is a fascist.

882
00:55:44,461 --> 00:55:47,628
Blue Beetle had a sense of humor.

883
00:55:48,961 --> 00:55:51,711
Dad never could
to unlock Carabus.

884
00:55:51,795 --> 00:55:55,628
Instead, he made his own equipment
to fight like Blue Beetle.

885
00:55:56,170 --> 00:55:58,753
If there's a way to get it out, it's there.

886
00:55:59,336 --> 00:56:00,961
Let's crack this one!

887
00:56:04,961 --> 00:56:07,295
- Damn you!
- This is your shirt.

888
00:56:07,378 --> 00:56:09,920
Come on, I think I am
some of dad's clothes upstairs.

889
00:56:10,003 --> 00:56:12,128
It is a good idea.
This is going to take a while.

890
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,336
God!

891
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:21,336
When will this day end?

892
00:56:35,545 --> 00:56:36,920
Everything is okay?

893
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,170
Yes. Yes. I'm going out right away.

894
00:56:41,461 --> 00:56:45,045
Yeah, I think... I think I'm coming.

895
00:56:45,128 --> 00:56:46,753
And they're comfortable too, so…

896
00:56:49,295 --> 00:56:50,336
Good.

897
00:56:51,378 --> 00:56:54,170
It must have been really cool
to grow up here, right?

898
00:56:54,253 --> 00:56:57,961
Honestly, it was...
I was quite alone most of the time.

899
00:56:59,795 --> 00:57:02,128
- Was it just the three of you here?
- Yes.

900
00:57:02,211 --> 00:57:04,545
That was my mother's last painting.

901
00:57:05,086 --> 00:57:06,170
Why did it stop?

902
00:57:06,628 --> 00:57:08,503
My mother died when I was six years old.

903
00:57:11,628 --> 00:57:12,961
We do not...

904
00:57:13,045 --> 00:57:15,336
- I am sorry that...
- No, it's okay.

905
00:57:17,836 --> 00:57:18,836
what was it like

906
00:57:20,253 --> 00:57:21,711
She was great.

907
00:57:23,836 --> 00:57:25,086
She was great.

908
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:30,295
It changed my dad's life.

909
00:57:30,753 --> 00:57:33,961
She taught him that the world is a place
what needs to be protected.

910
00:57:34,045 --> 00:57:35,253
Beautiful!

911
00:57:37,378 --> 00:57:41,170
But when my mother died,
it really got lost.

912
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:49,295
He was obsessed with Carabusul
and disappeared for days on end.

913
00:57:51,295 --> 00:57:53,253
Sometimes weeks.

914
00:57:54,045 --> 00:57:55,420
And one day...

915
00:57:57,128 --> 00:57:58,461
he left and...

916
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:01,670
he never came back.

917
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:04,545
I'm so sorry, Jenny.

918
00:58:08,878 --> 00:58:10,420
You are very lucky.

919
00:58:11,545 --> 00:58:15,586
This house... is full of stuff.

920
00:58:16,545 --> 00:58:19,003
Your house is full of love.

921
00:58:22,045 --> 00:58:23,253
A family.

922
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:26,420
Yes.

923
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:27,670
That's a dorm.

924
00:58:32,003 --> 00:58:34,128
I am sorry. I am so sorry.

925
00:58:34,795 --> 00:58:36,128
For what?

926
00:58:36,211 --> 00:58:40,128
I didn't talk about it anymore
for a very long time.

927
00:58:42,378 --> 00:58:44,378
Sounds like fun to do, doesn't it?

928
00:58:46,503 --> 00:58:47,795
Thank you.

929
00:58:48,253 --> 00:58:49,253
Yes.

930
00:58:49,670 --> 00:58:51,253
You know how to listen.

931
00:58:53,003 --> 00:58:55,253
Mom says it is
because of the big ears.

932
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:04,503
Look, I found something...

933
00:59:04,586 --> 00:59:06,711
- Nothing happened.
- Her mother died.

934
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:09,961
I found something you need to see.

935
00:59:10,045 --> 00:59:13,086
Perfect! That's great! Come on!

936
00:59:14,461 --> 00:59:15,878
Nice pajamas, güey.

937
00:59:20,461 --> 00:59:21,461
Good.

938
00:59:22,253 --> 00:59:23,628
I looked through the files.

939
00:59:24,128 --> 00:59:27,795
So, Ted had a teacher,
a guy named Dan Garrett.

940
00:59:27,878 --> 00:59:31,961
The bastard chose this Garrett
before they choose you.

941
00:59:32,045 --> 00:59:34,961
And pinche Ted was testing it
to see

942
00:59:35,045 --> 00:59:37,378
how Carabus reacted to the human body.

943
00:59:37,461 --> 00:59:39,753
When the Carabus sticks in someone's ass...

944
00:59:40,170 --> 00:59:41,586
It didn't bother me.

945
00:59:41,961 --> 00:59:46,753
Okay, it connects through the brain
and that's what he's trying to do to you, Jaime.

946
00:59:46,878 --> 00:59:48,711
Try to be one with you.

947
00:59:48,795 --> 00:59:49,711
Why?

948
00:59:49,795 --> 00:59:52,628
Ask him yourself! It has its own will.

949
00:59:53,086 --> 00:59:54,128
He is aware.

950
00:59:54,211 --> 00:59:55,961
That's why it chooses a host.

951
00:59:56,045 --> 00:59:59,003
That's why sometimes it does what you want
and sometimes not.

952
00:59:59,336 --> 01:00:01,420
Who made it? can i help us

953
01:00:01,711 --> 01:00:03,170
It wasn't made on Earth, cabezón.

954
01:00:03,253 --> 01:00:04,586
- You can not!
- Sure.

955
01:00:05,045 --> 01:00:08,420
- It's alien.
- I don't really like the term.

956
01:00:08,586 --> 01:00:10,878
- You can use it, but...
- It doesn't matter, Rudy.

957
01:00:10,961 --> 01:00:13,878
What happened to Ted's teacher?
How did he get it out?

958
01:00:14,711 --> 01:00:16,461
You might want to sit down.

959
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:20,128
Or not. Good...

960
01:00:20,211 --> 01:00:22,562
- Rudy, please! Concentrate!
- I have good and bad news.

961
01:00:22,586 --> 01:00:24,878
The good news is that I figured it out
how to remove it.

962
01:00:24,961 --> 01:00:25,961
Good.

963
01:00:26,253 --> 01:00:28,711
And the bad news
it's that you must be dead.

964
01:00:29,503 --> 01:00:30,836
- What the?
- Dead.

965
01:00:31,295 --> 01:00:32,503
What do you mean "dead"?

966
01:00:32,586 --> 01:00:36,545
Look, Jaime, now merge
with every cell in your body.

967
01:00:36,628 --> 01:00:39,003
It's completely wrapped around your brain.

968
01:00:40,045 --> 01:00:42,170
And nothing on Earth
he could not remove it.

969
01:00:42,253 --> 01:00:45,961
It is made to defend its host.
To keep her alive.

970
01:00:46,045 --> 01:00:50,670
- So this is in me forever?
- No, it's not forever.

971
01:00:50,753 --> 01:00:54,503
Only until you... die.

972
01:00:55,795 --> 01:01:00,211
Sounds cool to me, right?
You're basically a superhero, cabrón.

973
01:01:00,295 --> 01:01:04,170
- I am so sorry! I had no way...
- You did not know.

974
01:01:04,253 --> 01:01:05,836
So what options do I have now?

975
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:10,128
Option one is to become an android
for the rest of the life.

976
01:01:10,253 --> 01:01:14,045
Or option two is to volunteer
a psychopathic billionaire criminal?

977
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:16,170
I just wanted a job.

978
01:01:16,253 --> 01:01:18,711
- Pérate, güey. Maybe it's a...
- Maybe what, Rudy?

979
01:01:18,795 --> 01:01:21,878
It's all bad news.
That does not improve our situation.

980
01:01:21,961 --> 01:01:23,628
I don't understand why you can't...

981
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:25,503
God!

982
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:29,378
Finally. I'm going to take two steps.

983
01:01:29,461 --> 01:01:30,545
Jaime, just...

984
01:01:31,128 --> 01:01:33,253
I talk to him.
I think I know where this is going.

985
01:01:33,670 --> 01:01:35,795
Cabezón, wait!

986
01:01:46,086 --> 01:01:47,170
God!

987
01:01:52,670 --> 01:01:56,003
Look at him! I knew I would find you here.

988
01:01:56,628 --> 01:01:58,128
Like a cat, Jaime.

989
01:02:06,670 --> 01:02:09,961
Forgive me for yelling at you, Rudy.
I shouldn't have, but...

990
01:02:10,878 --> 01:02:16,336
It doesn't escape me that your situation
it's a bit unusual.

991
01:02:19,128 --> 01:02:20,128
Yes we are...

992
01:02:20,586 --> 01:02:22,336
We are resilient people.

993
01:02:22,711 --> 01:02:25,670
Life will keep hitting us

994
01:02:26,545 --> 01:02:28,586
and the difference is that it makes us
stronger.

995
01:02:29,961 --> 01:02:34,253
Look at your father!
He brought me here from Sonora.

996
01:02:34,378 --> 01:02:38,211
I was ten years old. He was 19 I think.

997
01:02:39,253 --> 01:02:41,670
And people think that crossing the border is difficult.

998
01:02:41,753 --> 01:02:43,836
Yes, it's hard, but you know what's even harder?

999
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:47,170
The next 20 years, on the leash.

1000
01:02:48,378 --> 01:02:53,045
But your viejo worked 16 hours a day,
he was scolding himself.

1001
01:02:53,128 --> 01:02:55,253
Any grief caught.

1002
01:02:55,336 --> 01:02:57,628
Jornalero, waiter, waiter.

1003
01:02:57,711 --> 01:03:00,878
He was a mechanic, he was a todo,
dishwasher.

1004
01:03:02,253 --> 01:03:05,711
And it brought us all here
and held us all together.

1005
01:03:06,503 --> 01:03:09,128
And not that he wanted to, but that he had to.

1006
01:03:10,170 --> 01:03:11,420
We go from there.

1007
01:03:12,253 --> 01:03:14,503
The universe sent you a gift, Jaime.

1008
01:03:16,128 --> 01:03:18,128
And you'll have to see what you're going to do with it.

1009
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:21,336
Maybe it happened for a reason.

1010
01:03:22,378 --> 01:03:25,753
Maybe it's time we had our own hero.

1011
01:03:27,003 --> 01:03:29,128
Not just kicks in the ass.

1012
01:03:30,503 --> 01:03:31,503
But what do I know?

1013
01:03:31,586 --> 01:03:35,628
I'm just a broken promise
who sleeps in his brother's living room.

1014
01:03:36,753 --> 01:03:38,295
Don't say that, man!

1015
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:40,461
You are not a broken promise.

1016
01:03:40,545 --> 01:03:43,128
Come on, you're the best! You know this.

1017
01:03:43,211 --> 01:03:44,628
- I am the best.
- Yes.

1018
01:03:46,253 --> 01:03:48,836
And I love you.

1019
01:03:50,003 --> 01:03:52,711
I love you too, cabezón.
OK.

1020
01:03:53,295 --> 01:03:55,170
- Yes.
- Guys?

1021
01:03:56,503 --> 01:03:57,878
Do you hear that?

1022
01:03:59,378 --> 01:04:00,503
It's Victoria.

1023
01:04:06,003 --> 01:04:07,336
Where are they going?

1024
01:04:09,586 --> 01:04:10,961
The home.

1025
01:04:12,378 --> 01:04:14,795
You are wasting too much water.

1026
01:04:25,586 --> 01:04:26,836
It's always my fault.

1027
01:04:40,631 --> 01:04:41,673
(in italian)

1028
01:04:55,378 --> 01:04:56,545
Hear...

1029
01:04:58,378 --> 01:05:00,045
I think there's someone at the window.

1030
01:05:09,295 --> 01:05:11,586
Jaime Reyes, come out with your hands up!

1031
01:05:11,670 --> 01:05:14,836
Surrender! We are authorized
to use lethal force.

1032
01:05:18,769 --> 01:05:20,337
(in italian)

1033
01:05:22,836 --> 01:05:24,253
Good. Good.

1034
01:05:26,003 --> 01:05:27,878
I will fly. I will fly.

1035
01:05:28,336 --> 01:05:29,753
Let's do this!

1036
01:05:31,836 --> 01:05:33,003
Yes!

1037
01:05:35,420 --> 01:05:37,045
Yeah, no chance.

1038
01:05:39,503 --> 01:05:40,628
Now!

1039
01:05:41,378 --> 01:05:44,045
Man, don't worry! Do not rush.

1040
01:05:44,046 --> 01:05:44,960
Thank you, Jenny.

1041
01:05:44,961 --> 01:05:47,295
- You have to force him out.
- What the...?

1042
01:05:53,961 --> 01:05:56,503
- You are a genius.
- Know. What I said?

1043
01:05:56,586 --> 01:05:59,336
You said you were going to protect me, right?
He won't let me die?

1044
01:05:59,420 --> 01:06:00,795
No no. When you die...

1045
01:06:01,211 --> 01:06:02,854
- Let's see if it works.
- I wouldn't test this.

1046
01:06:02,878 --> 01:06:04,961
- No, no, no, Jaime!
- Wait, Jaime!

1047
01:06:24,128 --> 01:06:27,211
- We're going back to Tacoma, I guess.
- Yes.

1048
01:06:33,586 --> 01:06:36,003
We surrounded the Reyes' house.
The family is inside.

1049
01:06:36,086 --> 01:06:37,628
You know what you have to do.

1050
01:06:38,295 --> 01:06:39,711
Take them!

1051
01:06:39,795 --> 01:06:41,961
Penetration team, go!

1052
01:06:42,086 --> 01:06:43,128
With me!

1053
01:06:46,378 --> 01:06:47,420
I entered.

1054
01:06:49,086 --> 01:06:51,211
Spread yourself out! The light!

1055
01:06:52,170 --> 01:06:53,170
Free!

1056
01:06:53,878 --> 01:06:55,670
- The light!
- I'm defending your left.

1057
01:06:57,378 --> 01:06:58,753
Back room, free!

1058
01:06:59,336 --> 01:07:00,336
Free!

1059
01:07:01,878 --> 01:07:03,378
Hands on head. Don't move!

1060
01:07:03,461 --> 01:07:04,878
- Good good.
- Don't move!

1061
01:07:04,961 --> 01:07:06,229
- Don't touch my family!
- Get up!

1062
01:07:06,253 --> 01:07:07,836
Come on! Up, up!

1063
01:07:08,211 --> 01:07:09,961
Hands up! Watch out on the right!

1064
01:07:10,753 --> 01:07:12,711
Miss Kord, we found the family.

1065
01:07:15,003 --> 01:07:17,670
- I'm going out now.
- Take them out! Come on!

1066
01:07:18,795 --> 01:07:19,836
Force them out!

1067
01:07:22,295 --> 01:07:24,253
Come on! Move!

1068
01:07:25,003 --> 01:07:26,003
Move!

1069
01:07:28,586 --> 01:07:30,336
C'mon C'mon!

1070
01:07:36,795 --> 01:07:38,003
Do not oppose!

1071
01:07:46,836 --> 01:07:48,670
Down! Down!

1072
01:07:49,045 --> 01:07:51,670
Down now! Come now!

1073
01:07:54,336 --> 01:07:55,753
The kid isn't there.

1074
01:07:56,420 --> 01:07:58,003
Find him!

1075
01:07:59,253 --> 01:08:00,253
Is he in?

1076
01:08:00,831 --> 01:08:01,999
(in italian)

1077
01:08:02,045 --> 01:08:03,045
Where is it?

1078
01:08:04,295 --> 01:08:05,670
Where is it?

1079
01:08:06,253 --> 01:08:08,295
Where is it?

1080
01:08:12,295 --> 01:08:16,086
- I could use the arsenal now.
- I didn't think you would ask again.

1081
01:08:16,170 --> 01:08:17,170
Hell yes!

1082
01:08:24,545 --> 01:08:25,420
Well done Khaji!

1083
01:08:25,503 --> 01:08:26,503
Are you OK?

1084
01:08:27,045 --> 01:08:29,211
- Jaime?
- Sorry I'm late, mom.

1085
01:08:29,586 --> 01:08:30,961
Magnificent!

1086
01:08:31,045 --> 01:08:32,545
wait what?

1087
01:08:33,836 --> 01:08:36,253
Don't shoot! I don't want to hurt you.

1088
01:08:36,836 --> 01:08:38,045
Fire!

1089
01:08:38,586 --> 01:08:39,586
Damn it!

1090
01:08:39,628 --> 01:08:40,920
I said don't shoot!

1091
01:08:44,670 --> 01:08:46,795
God, I'm bulletproof.

1092
01:08:47,128 --> 01:08:48,878
Let's see what you can do!

1093
01:08:49,461 --> 01:08:50,920
Target the family!

1094
01:08:51,836 --> 01:08:53,503
- Attack!
- Liquidate them!

1095
01:08:56,503 --> 01:08:58,336
I'll protect you, no worries!

1096
01:08:58,420 --> 01:08:59,961
It will be okay.

1097
01:09:01,586 --> 01:09:03,211
Okay, let's see what you can do.

1098
01:09:03,295 --> 01:09:04,586
Threat removal.

1099
01:09:04,670 --> 01:09:06,795
What the? No, Khaji, we don't kill them!

1100
01:09:07,795 --> 01:09:09,420
Yes, that's how it goes!

1101
01:09:19,128 --> 01:09:20,128
Leave here!

1102
01:09:20,336 --> 01:09:21,336
Run away!

1103
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:25,878
- Threat level analysis.
- Okay, let's do this!

1104
01:09:36,253 --> 01:09:37,295
Hell yes!

1105
01:09:38,878 --> 01:09:39,878
Down to earth!

1106
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:41,711
- Daddy!
- Honey!

1107
01:09:41,795 --> 01:09:42,795
I caught one.

1108
01:09:43,517 --> 01:09:44,643
(in italian)

1109
01:09:44,711 --> 01:09:46,211
Down! Do not move!

1110
01:09:47,086 --> 01:09:48,128
Stay where you are!

1111
01:09:49,628 --> 01:09:50,628
- Not!
- I caught another one.

1112
01:09:50,670 --> 01:09:51,920
Father!

1113
01:09:53,503 --> 01:09:54,878
Come to my father!

1114
01:09:59,336 --> 01:10:00,878
Carapax, prepare the claw!

1115
01:10:10,836 --> 01:10:12,378
Daddy, I'm scared.

1116
01:10:13,045 --> 01:10:14,795
Everything will be alright.

1117
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:17,920
- Jaime, your family.
- Sit down!

1118
01:10:19,336 --> 01:10:20,336
Get up!

1119
01:10:21,628 --> 01:10:23,045
Okay, come on, papi!

1120
01:10:23,878 --> 01:10:26,211
Mili, get dad out of here! Go!

1121
01:10:26,753 --> 01:10:28,670
- Go!
- Good. Let's go!

1122
01:10:31,253 --> 01:10:32,336
Prepare her!

1123
01:10:34,753 --> 01:10:37,586
They have a gun. I suggest we retreat.

1124
01:10:37,670 --> 01:10:41,003
No way! attack my family
we're going to finish this.

1125
01:10:41,795 --> 01:10:43,295
And...

1126
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:48,128
Father...

1127
01:10:48,211 --> 01:10:50,545
Dad, no! Dad, what is it?

1128
01:10:50,628 --> 01:10:51,878
Father! Father!

1129
01:10:52,003 --> 01:10:54,670
No no no! Father!

1130
01:10:54,753 --> 01:10:56,461
Not!

1131
01:10:56,545 --> 01:10:57,878
No no no!

1132
01:10:58,211 --> 01:10:59,961
- Father!
- Not!

1133
01:11:00,045 --> 01:11:01,045
Now!

1134
01:11:04,503 --> 01:11:05,878
What happens?

1135
01:11:06,461 --> 01:11:10,003
- Symbiotic systems... critical.
- Khaji, do something!

1136
01:11:14,170 --> 01:11:15,878
Dad, no!

1137
01:11:16,170 --> 01:11:18,336
Father! The water!

1138
01:11:25,295 --> 01:11:28,461
Not. No no no.

1139
01:11:28,545 --> 01:11:29,545
Not.

1140
01:11:29,628 --> 01:11:31,295
No, Jaime.

1141
01:11:31,378 --> 01:11:33,128
Jaime, watch out!

1142
01:11:34,711 --> 01:11:36,378
You! You!

1143
01:11:36,836 --> 01:11:38,711
What do you want from us?

1144
01:11:41,211 --> 01:11:42,295
What are you doing?

1145
01:11:42,670 --> 01:11:45,170
Take that away from me, psycho!

1146
01:11:45,961 --> 01:11:48,086
Mother!

1147
01:11:49,045 --> 01:11:50,878
- Mommy!
- Honey!

1148
01:11:51,503 --> 01:11:52,878
Alberto!

1149
01:11:54,211 --> 01:11:55,086
Alberto!

1150
01:11:55,170 --> 01:11:56,461
Let me go!

1151
01:11:57,253 --> 01:11:59,711
- Khaji, do something!
- I caught him. Let's go!

1152
01:12:23,045 --> 01:12:24,961
- Rudy. Rudy, Rudy.
- Hermano, wake up!

1153
01:12:29,295 --> 01:12:30,878
The water!

1154
01:12:32,503 --> 01:12:34,920
I'll come... I'll come get you.

1155
01:12:46,003 --> 01:12:47,336
Call an ambulance!

1156
01:13:07,211 --> 01:13:08,211
Free!

1157
01:13:10,961 --> 01:13:12,461
Free! Free!

1158
01:13:54,476 --> 01:13:56,395
(in italian)

1159
01:13:58,939 --> 01:14:02,484
(in italian)

1160
01:14:03,318 --> 01:14:04,695
(in italian)

1161
01:14:05,028 --> 01:14:07,322
(in italian)

1162
01:14:21,587 --> 01:14:23,297
(in italian)

1163
01:14:24,339 --> 01:14:26,717
(in italian)

1164
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:28,719
(in italian)

1165
01:14:29,511 --> 01:14:31,138
(in italian)

1166
01:14:31,711 --> 01:14:34,253
But not now.

1167
01:14:36,894 --> 01:14:38,812
(in italian)

1168
01:14:38,896 --> 01:14:41,857
(in italian)

1169
01:14:42,711 --> 01:14:46,253
Nana is right, Mili.
We have to save Jaime.

1170
01:14:46,336 --> 01:14:47,378
How?

1171
01:14:47,461 --> 01:14:49,878
We don't even know where they took him.

1172
01:14:50,628 --> 01:14:52,420
I might know where it is.

1173
01:14:56,253 --> 01:14:57,295
Please!

1174
01:14:58,253 --> 01:14:59,753
Come with me!

1175
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:03,253
I can help.

1176
01:15:07,086 --> 01:15:08,378
Be careful!

1177
01:15:29,586 --> 01:15:30,586
Good.

1178
01:15:31,086 --> 01:15:32,253
Let's do this!

1179
01:15:36,420 --> 01:15:38,170
Miraculous, hurry up. Come on!

1180
01:15:38,253 --> 01:15:39,586
Good good.

1181
01:15:40,086 --> 01:15:41,253
Enough enough.

1182
01:15:43,503 --> 01:15:44,836
Good.

1183
01:15:45,253 --> 01:15:47,420
Let's hope the Kord technology works.

1184
01:15:54,211 --> 01:15:55,378
Stay like that!

1185
01:16:00,461 --> 01:16:01,586
Man!

1186
01:16:13,045 --> 01:16:15,045
- Done.
- Welcome back to the Beetle Ship, Teddy!

1187
01:16:15,128 --> 01:16:17,253
- That's sexy!
- Look at you!

1188
01:16:17,336 --> 01:16:18,628
- It's crazy!
- Thrusters!

1189
01:16:26,545 --> 01:16:28,229
- Let's get our boy!
- Let's do this!

1190
01:16:28,253 --> 01:16:29,253
Jenny.

1191
01:16:34,370 --> 01:16:35,419
Good.

1192
01:16:35,420 --> 01:16:37,253
Good, good, good. Good.

1193
01:16:43,836 --> 01:16:46,211
And what's the plan when we get there?

1194
01:16:47,711 --> 01:16:51,086
- We burn that bridge when we get there.
- That's not how they say it...

1195
01:17:01,003 --> 01:17:03,003
Amá, fly!

1196
01:17:08,878 --> 01:17:14,253
After 15 years, everything I've done,
all the sacrifices

1197
01:17:14,336 --> 01:17:16,795
they drove at this point.

1198
01:17:17,336 --> 01:17:21,336
Finally, the power of Carabus
it will be ours.

1199
01:17:21,420 --> 01:17:22,711
Almost ready.

1200
01:17:22,795 --> 01:17:25,795
We're going to change the world, Carapax.

1201
01:17:25,878 --> 01:17:27,336
Are you ready?

1202
01:17:27,420 --> 01:17:28,586
I'm ready.

1203
01:17:35,072 --> 01:17:37,241
(in italian)

1204
01:17:37,295 --> 01:17:38,920
Is that bulletproof?

1205
01:17:41,620 --> 01:17:45,207
(in italian)

1206
01:17:48,336 --> 01:17:52,045
Do you want to see daddy's toys?

1207
01:17:56,295 --> 01:17:59,003
Wait, is that Kabloom gum?

1208
01:17:59,086 --> 01:18:01,003
No no. It's not what you think.

1209
01:18:01,086 --> 01:18:02,086
Kabloom CHEWING GUM!

1210
01:18:02,461 --> 01:18:07,336
It's just a special prototype
designed by dad.

1211
01:18:07,878 --> 01:18:09,586
Do these work?

1212
01:18:11,003 --> 01:18:14,003
Some. Sometimes.

1213
01:18:19,461 --> 01:18:21,128
That's the Beetle Shield.

1214
01:18:21,211 --> 01:18:23,045
Try pressing another button.

1215
01:18:29,836 --> 01:18:32,753
Yeah, you know what?
I think I'll keep this one.

1216
01:18:36,545 --> 01:18:40,878
Okay, so how do we learn to use these?

1217
01:18:43,128 --> 01:18:44,128
Nanny?

1218
01:18:45,086 --> 01:18:48,003
How do you know how to hold that perfectly?

1219
01:18:51,106 --> 01:18:54,359
(in italian)

1220
01:18:59,586 --> 01:19:01,628
This is where they took Jaime.

1221
01:19:01,711 --> 01:19:04,878
Pago is an island in the Caribbean,
near the Cuban coast,

1222
01:19:04,961 --> 01:19:08,086
which Kord bought
from Batista in the 50s.

1223
01:19:08,170 --> 01:19:09,961
It's a fortress.

1224
01:19:10,045 --> 01:19:11,628
How the hell are we going to get in there?

1225
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:14,505
(in italian)

1226
01:19:14,586 --> 01:19:15,670
What the hell?

1227
01:19:15,753 --> 01:19:18,753
Mili, one day we will have to talk
about grandma's revolutionary past.

1228
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:19,669
Here you go?

1229
01:19:19,676 --> 01:19:21,845
(in italian)

1230
01:19:24,515 --> 01:19:27,726
That's where we enter!

1231
01:19:29,553 --> 01:19:31,813
(in italian)

1232
01:19:31,897 --> 01:19:34,233
(in italian)

1233
01:19:34,316 --> 01:19:36,360
directly to the basement.

1234
01:19:36,420 --> 01:19:37,836
Yes, the generators are here.

1235
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:40,461
We can burn them, leave them without electricity.

1236
01:19:42,908 --> 01:19:45,619
(in italian)

1237
01:19:45,702 --> 01:19:48,205
(in italian)

1238
01:19:48,622 --> 01:19:49,957
(in italian)

1239
01:19:51,336 --> 01:19:52,628
Damn it, nana!

1240
01:20:16,628 --> 01:20:17,628
Who are you?

1241
01:20:18,753 --> 01:20:19,878
What are you doing?

1242
01:20:19,961 --> 01:20:21,503
Get me out of this please!

1243
01:20:21,878 --> 01:20:23,503
Is there a problem, Sanchez?

1244
01:20:23,586 --> 01:20:25,045
I am sorry.

1245
01:20:25,128 --> 01:20:28,878
You're sorry! What this means?
Tell him to snap me out of it!

1246
01:20:31,795 --> 01:20:33,920
It's fine.

1247
01:20:34,003 --> 01:20:36,420
Yes. Listen, kid!

1248
01:20:37,003 --> 01:20:40,295
The bastard chose you.
This is true.

1249
01:20:40,378 --> 01:20:45,211
But it doesn't belong to you.
It belongs to me.

1250
01:20:45,295 --> 01:20:47,586
But now that you've activated it,

1251
01:20:47,670 --> 01:20:51,378
we can transfer his code
directly in OMAC.

1252
01:20:51,461 --> 01:20:52,670
What are you talking about?

1253
01:20:52,753 --> 01:20:55,045
No, no, Miss Kord. It could kill him.

1254
01:20:55,128 --> 01:20:56,336
Nasty!

1255
01:20:56,420 --> 01:21:00,336
But sacrifices must be made
for the greater good.

1256
01:21:00,420 --> 01:21:03,670
And this is yours, Jaime Reyes.

1257
01:21:04,045 --> 01:21:05,253
Do it, Sanchez!

1258
01:21:05,336 --> 01:21:07,545
With all due respect,
my name is not Sanchez

1259
01:21:07,628 --> 01:21:08,461
Hey, hey!

1260
01:21:08,545 --> 01:21:10,003
Get me out of this!

1261
01:21:14,503 --> 01:21:15,503
Damn it!

1262
01:21:29,086 --> 01:21:30,086
Beetle.

1263
01:21:30,211 --> 01:21:32,086
- Rudy.
- Yes, I see him.

1264
01:21:35,545 --> 01:21:36,628
You're going too fast!

1265
01:21:38,211 --> 01:21:39,503
There is no death attempt!

1266
01:21:39,586 --> 01:21:40,670
AIR BRAKES

1267
01:21:41,711 --> 01:21:44,045
Hold on!

1268
01:21:45,503 --> 01:21:48,086
Good. Good.

1269
01:21:50,086 --> 01:21:51,711
It's coming!

1270
01:21:51,795 --> 01:21:53,045
Prepare for impact!

1271
01:22:07,545 --> 01:22:08,920
Come on, come on!

1272
01:22:09,545 --> 01:22:12,003
At the wall! Attack! Attack!

1273
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:18,461
Rudy, do something!

1274
01:22:18,545 --> 01:22:20,586
Rudy, we have to move.

1275
01:22:21,836 --> 01:22:22,836
BEAST MODE

1276
01:22:33,628 --> 01:22:34,795
Let's go!

1277
01:22:41,045 --> 01:22:42,128
Good good.

1278
01:22:57,845 --> 01:22:58,795
To one side!

1279
01:22:58,878 --> 01:22:59,878
I am sorry!

1280
01:23:05,211 --> 01:23:07,045
- It's like I can't miss!
- There!

1281
01:23:12,075 --> 01:23:13,035
(in italian)

1282
01:23:13,086 --> 01:23:14,336
Twenty points!

1283
01:23:26,961 --> 01:23:28,836
I activate the camouflage system.

1284
01:23:30,795 --> 01:23:32,586
Activate cockroach.

1285
01:23:40,545 --> 01:23:41,711
Not from here!

1286
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:16,628
- Yes, this way!
- Good.

1287
01:24:16,711 --> 01:24:18,420
Hey, come on!

1288
01:24:19,461 --> 01:24:21,045
I know you hear me.

1289
01:24:24,420 --> 01:24:25,795
Let me go!

1290
01:24:36,586 --> 01:24:38,253
I'll keep him safe.

1291
01:24:39,128 --> 01:24:40,170
Start the transfer!

1292
01:24:40,253 --> 01:24:42,628
And when it's done, kill the kid!

1293
01:24:43,503 --> 01:24:44,503
Get me out of here!

1294
01:24:44,545 --> 01:24:46,854
But we could learn a lot
from his connection with Carabus.

1295
01:24:46,878 --> 01:24:49,128
We can learn a lot more
from his corpse.

1296
01:24:49,211 --> 01:24:52,170
Let me go! Not! Not!

1297
01:25:10,211 --> 01:25:11,961
Miracle! Hide!

1298
01:25:22,378 --> 01:25:23,586
God!

1299
01:25:24,628 --> 01:25:26,336
Okay, I guess that's okay.

1300
01:25:28,045 --> 01:25:29,045
What the...?

1301
01:25:34,420 --> 01:25:38,128
Victoria, you damn fool!

1302
01:25:38,878 --> 01:25:40,795
what the hell is this

1303
01:25:40,878 --> 01:25:45,253
Fully functional OMAC systems.
Enough to make an army.

1304
01:25:59,795 --> 01:26:01,420
Miss Kord, this doesn't look good.

1305
01:26:01,503 --> 01:26:02,420
What happens?

1306
01:26:02,503 --> 01:26:05,003
Oh, no. Downloading Carabus
generates too much energy.

1307
01:26:05,086 --> 01:26:06,253
Systems are at full capacity.

1308
01:26:06,336 --> 01:26:07,545
What this means?

1309
01:26:07,628 --> 01:26:09,920
The transfer is killing him.

1310
01:26:10,045 --> 01:26:12,545
He can't die
before the transfer is complete.

1311
01:26:12,628 --> 01:26:13,753
His pulse drops.

1312
01:26:13,836 --> 01:26:15,545
Straighten it up!

1313
01:26:37,253 --> 01:26:39,211
Hey, flaco.

1314
01:26:50,253 --> 01:26:51,336
Father.

1315
01:26:54,461 --> 01:26:55,795
What happens?

1316
01:26:59,795 --> 01:27:01,461
What are you doing here?

1317
01:27:05,378 --> 01:27:06,378
Know...

1318
01:27:08,211 --> 01:27:10,545
Not. The water.

1319
01:27:14,109 --> 01:27:16,195
(in italian)

1320
01:27:23,795 --> 01:27:25,836
Miracle, here.

1321
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:27,420
Help me with these!

1322
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:53,003
Jaime.

1323
01:27:55,961 --> 01:27:57,503
It's not your time yet.

1324
01:27:58,336 --> 01:27:59,670
You have to go back.

1325
01:28:00,364 --> 01:28:01,782
(in italian)

1326
01:28:02,420 --> 01:28:03,420
Please!

1327
01:28:04,128 --> 01:28:06,295
I understand everything now.

1328
01:28:07,711 --> 01:28:10,878
I was meant to be here with you.

1329
01:28:11,211 --> 01:28:12,378
At this point.

1330
01:28:13,670 --> 01:28:15,795
To help you pass.

1331
01:28:17,297 --> 01:28:19,800
(in italian)

1332
01:28:20,092 --> 02:56:40,598
(in italian)

1333
01:28:22,761 --> 01:28:24,555
(in italian)

1334
01:28:25,795 --> 01:28:27,878
That's your goal.

1335
01:28:55,510 --> 01:28:58,547
(in italian)

1336
01:28:59,210 --> 01:29:02,547
Time to accept your destiny, Jaime.

1337
01:29:16,628 --> 01:29:18,878
How am I going to do this without you?

1338
01:29:19,693 --> 01:29:22,529
(in italian)

1339
01:29:23,295 --> 01:29:25,378
How will I know what to do?

1340
01:29:25,741 --> 01:29:29,036
(in italian)

1341
01:29:39,463 --> 01:29:40,964
(in italian)

1342
01:29:42,670 --> 01:29:44,878
I love you too, papi.

1343
01:30:04,586 --> 01:30:05,711
Something is happening.

1344
01:30:06,336 --> 01:30:07,378
What the?

1345
01:30:07,461 --> 01:30:09,941
His brainwaves are synchronizing
with the Carăbușului frequency.

1346
01:30:10,378 --> 01:30:12,295
There. It's connecting.

1347
01:30:16,878 --> 01:30:19,128
I need you, Khaji!

1348
01:30:22,170 --> 01:30:23,961
I become one.

1349
01:30:35,253 --> 01:30:36,253
Did I get the code?

1350
01:30:36,336 --> 01:30:38,753
The transfer is complete. The code is ours.

1351
01:30:38,836 --> 01:30:40,253
It works!

1352
01:30:56,378 --> 01:30:57,378
Oh no!

1353
01:30:59,586 --> 01:31:01,045
Go! Go! Go!

1354
01:31:18,586 --> 01:31:20,670
Good. We let it go!

1355
01:31:40,045 --> 01:31:41,503
- OK, come on!
- Yes.

1356
01:31:58,461 --> 01:32:00,295
Not. No no no!

1357
01:32:02,670 --> 01:32:04,545
Sanchez, stop him!

1358
01:32:04,961 --> 01:32:05,961
Oh damn!

1359
01:32:17,753 --> 01:32:18,753
What the?

1360
01:32:19,128 --> 01:32:21,211
Take your family and run off the island!

1361
01:32:21,295 --> 01:32:22,128
Stay! The family?

1362
01:32:22,211 --> 01:32:24,545
- Quick!
- What do you mean "family"?

1363
01:32:25,461 --> 01:32:26,378
Go!

1364
01:32:26,461 --> 01:32:29,170
Sanchez, you idiot! What are you doing?

1365
01:32:30,670 --> 01:32:33,836
My name is not Sanchez, pendeja!

1366
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:37,586
It's Jose Francisco Morales
Rivera de la Cruz!

1367
01:32:40,503 --> 01:32:42,128
What are you doing?

1368
01:32:44,420 --> 01:32:45,878
Stop him, Carapax!

1369
01:32:47,503 --> 01:32:50,336
Go! I will be fine.

1370
01:32:53,711 --> 01:32:55,253
Okay, Khaji, come on!

1371
01:32:57,128 --> 01:32:59,045
Good. All right, Khaji, activate!

1372
01:32:59,128 --> 01:33:00,420
Reboot.

1373
01:33:00,503 --> 01:33:03,128
Reboot? You're kidding?

1374
01:33:05,045 --> 01:33:07,503
Oh God! Oh no! Oh no!

1375
01:33:14,711 --> 01:33:16,545
- Go, go!
- Good good.

1376
01:33:19,503 --> 01:33:20,545
Milagros, wait!

1377
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:23,128
- Oh, no, no!
- What? What?

1378
01:33:23,211 --> 01:33:24,211
No, no, be careful!

1379
01:33:33,170 --> 01:33:34,211
Jenny.

1380
01:33:35,378 --> 01:33:36,753
Jenny?

1381
01:33:38,378 --> 01:33:39,628
Jenny!

1382
01:33:45,961 --> 01:33:49,795
I can finally feel it.

1383
01:33:59,211 --> 01:34:04,211
This image really suits you.

1384
01:34:07,878 --> 01:34:09,086
Good.

1385
01:34:10,378 --> 01:34:12,503
Okay, Khaji. All right, Khaji-Da.

1386
01:34:12,586 --> 01:34:14,836
You can do this. You can do this.

1387
01:34:14,920 --> 01:34:17,461
Come on! Let's go! Come on!

1388
01:34:18,045 --> 01:34:19,128
Still rebooting.

1389
01:34:19,211 --> 01:34:20,461
Come on!

1390
01:34:37,961 --> 01:34:38,961
Do not move!

1391
01:34:40,753 --> 01:34:41,795
Stand there!

1392
01:34:43,670 --> 01:34:44,670
Come on!

1393
01:34:45,295 --> 01:34:46,295
Do not move!

1394
01:34:48,336 --> 01:34:49,545
Knock him down!

1395
01:35:02,086 --> 01:35:03,086
Nanny?

1396
01:35:05,205 --> 01:35:06,790
(in italian)

1397
01:35:06,836 --> 01:35:07,961
Good.

1398
01:35:08,503 --> 01:35:10,586
Where did you learn to shoot like that?

1399
01:35:11,295 --> 01:35:12,254
(in italian)

1400
01:35:31,295 --> 01:35:32,336
Open your eyes!

1401
01:35:40,032 --> 01:35:42,159
(in italian)

1402
01:35:53,212 --> 01:35:54,505
(in italian)

1403
01:36:18,170 --> 01:36:19,336
Miracle!

1404
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:27,711
Jennifer, Jennifer, Jennifer.

1405
01:36:28,170 --> 01:36:31,336
What a disaster you have created!

1406
01:36:32,045 --> 01:36:34,170
Come on! Standing! Get up!

1407
01:36:46,723 --> 01:36:47,724
(in italian)

1408
01:36:51,470 --> 01:36:52,544
Miraculous.

1409
01:36:52,545 --> 01:36:53,502
Where is it?

1410
01:36:53,503 --> 01:36:56,045
- Milagro and Jenny are there.
- You can not!

1411
01:36:56,420 --> 01:36:58,128
Okay, I have to go back.

1412
01:36:58,211 --> 01:36:59,128
Yes. And the suit?

1413
01:36:59,211 --> 01:37:00,812
It doesn't work now.
I can't deal with him.

1414
01:37:00,836 --> 01:37:02,128
- Jaime.
- Yes?

1415
01:37:04,086 --> 01:37:05,086
Good.

1416
01:37:05,545 --> 01:37:07,795
What is the name of that chongo?

1417
01:37:07,878 --> 01:37:08,878
Khaji- Yes.

1418
01:37:09,378 --> 01:37:10,378
Yes.

1419
01:37:11,170 --> 01:37:13,211
I know you hear me, Khaji-Da.

1420
01:37:14,586 --> 01:37:16,878
I want you both to come to your senses!

1421
01:37:17,003 --> 01:37:18,878
Find your strength, mijito!

1422
01:37:19,378 --> 01:37:23,378
Use the pain we feel
and turn it into power!

1423
01:37:23,795 --> 01:37:26,003
I want you back there...

1424
01:37:27,097 --> 01:37:30,475
(in italian)

1425
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:35,420
I found one of them.

1426
01:37:42,795 --> 01:37:44,003
Trouble!

1427
01:37:44,503 --> 01:37:46,586
- Drop the gun!
- Damn it!

1428
01:38:11,753 --> 01:38:13,336
Full reboot.

1429
01:38:13,420 --> 01:38:15,378
Get the hell away from my sister!

1430
01:38:15,670 --> 01:38:16,753
I'm out of ammo.

1431
01:38:17,795 --> 01:38:18,795
Are you ready, Khaji?

1432
01:38:18,774 --> 01:38:20,734
(in italian)

1433
01:38:21,545 --> 01:38:23,461
Come on them!

1434
01:38:23,545 --> 01:38:24,628
who's first

1435
01:38:32,170 --> 01:38:33,586
Want more?

1436
01:38:41,295 --> 01:38:42,420
Wait, watch out!

1437
01:38:42,503 --> 01:38:43,795
Attack the target!

1438
01:38:50,836 --> 01:38:51,920
Come on!

1439
01:39:02,253 --> 01:39:03,420
God, there are more!

1440
01:39:18,420 --> 01:39:19,461
Catch him!

1441
01:39:20,378 --> 01:39:22,503
What the hell? Get them off me!

1442
01:39:22,586 --> 01:39:23,586
With pleasure.

1443
01:39:25,961 --> 01:39:27,753
- Thank you, Khaji.
- No way.

1444
01:39:28,420 --> 01:39:29,545
Stay!

1445
01:39:29,878 --> 01:39:31,211
One more.

1446
01:39:33,253 --> 01:39:34,628
Get over here!

1447
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:46,545
Come on!

1448
01:39:47,461 --> 01:39:48,461
Nice slap!

1449
01:39:52,201 --> 01:39:53,785
(in italian)

1450
01:39:54,920 --> 01:39:56,920
Okay, I deserved that.

1451
01:39:58,628 --> 01:40:00,420
I thought I would never see you again.

1452
01:40:04,003 --> 01:40:05,670
I told you I'm not going anywhere.

1453
01:40:05,753 --> 01:40:07,753
- But you left...
- I wasn't there...

1454
01:40:09,753 --> 01:40:11,795
Rudy! Rudy!

1455
01:40:11,878 --> 01:40:14,670
Dear God! You are safe.
I thought I lost you.

1456
01:40:14,753 --> 01:40:16,670
No no. Look!

1457
01:40:18,586 --> 01:40:19,795
Stay! where is jenny

1458
01:40:20,420 --> 01:40:22,086
We were separated. I do not know.

1459
01:40:22,170 --> 01:40:23,461
Okay, we have to find her.

1460
01:40:23,545 --> 01:40:25,305
We will find her
before others, because...

1461
01:40:25,336 --> 01:40:26,545
Careful!

1462
01:40:31,170 --> 01:40:32,253
What the hell was that?

1463
01:40:34,253 --> 01:40:36,586
- OMAC is coming, Jaime.
- Damn it!

1464
01:40:43,961 --> 01:40:45,003
Give it up!

1465
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:48,628
Okay, let's do this, Khaji!
Give me rockets or something!

1466
01:40:48,711 --> 01:40:50,253
Detach blasters.

1467
01:40:53,336 --> 01:40:54,670
Okay, now give me the swords!

1468
01:40:55,461 --> 01:40:56,920
Okay, now give me...

1469
01:40:59,836 --> 01:41:01,354
Watch out, he's stronger than before.

1470
01:41:01,378 --> 01:41:02,378
Okay I understand.

1471
01:41:06,795 --> 01:41:09,128
- Okay, where are we going?
- At Ship-Bug! It's beyond.

1472
01:41:09,211 --> 01:41:12,128
- But where are you going?
- To take Cabezón. Go!

1473
01:41:23,586 --> 01:41:24,878
Critical wing damage.

1474
01:41:25,003 --> 01:41:27,503
You will help me? I'll help you too.

1475
01:41:35,795 --> 01:41:36,878
Okay, strongman!

1476
01:41:43,545 --> 01:41:45,253
You don't deserve this power!

1477
01:41:51,545 --> 01:41:53,753
I thought you hit harder than that!

1478
01:41:56,711 --> 01:41:58,753
Okay, we need something else, Khaji!

1479
01:41:58,836 --> 01:42:01,086
Power reactor access.

1480
01:42:02,378 --> 01:42:03,961
Like this!

1481
01:42:11,003 --> 01:42:12,878
Okay, do you want to dance?

1482
01:42:12,961 --> 01:42:14,420
Now give me a sword.

1483
01:42:16,670 --> 01:42:19,045
So I can make whatever weapons I want?

1484
01:42:19,128 --> 01:42:22,003
Anything you can imagine I can create.

1485
01:42:22,086 --> 01:42:23,336
Let's party!

1486
01:42:30,003 --> 01:42:31,003
Good choice!

1487
01:42:31,086 --> 01:42:32,170
Come on!

1488
01:42:34,545 --> 01:42:35,628
On time!

1489
01:42:48,461 --> 01:42:49,503
Yes!

1490
01:42:51,753 --> 01:42:52,961
Come on! Is that all you can do?

1491
01:42:53,045 --> 01:42:55,170
Let's not rush, Jaime!

1492
01:42:55,253 --> 01:42:57,920
Khaj, don't worry! We can do this.

1493
01:43:10,336 --> 01:43:12,545
Okay, it's a little harder than I thought.

1494
01:43:17,628 --> 01:43:19,753
Critical regenerative systems.

1495
01:43:19,836 --> 01:43:22,836
- What the hell?
- There can only be one of us.

1496
01:43:23,128 --> 01:43:24,920
Khaji, do something!

1497
01:43:30,545 --> 01:43:32,128
What? Can't you breathe?

1498
01:43:51,628 --> 01:43:54,211
Jaime, I can't protect you anymore.

1499
01:43:55,711 --> 01:43:57,045
I am sorry.

1500
01:44:01,253 --> 01:44:03,253
Khaji, Khaji, stay with me!

1501
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:06,170
You're still a scared little boy!

1502
01:44:21,086 --> 01:44:22,628
I told,

1503
01:44:22,711 --> 01:44:26,336
the love you feel
for your family it makes you weak.

1504
01:44:30,836 --> 01:44:31,836
Hey!

1505
01:44:32,147 --> 01:44:33,398
(in italian)

1506
01:44:34,836 --> 01:44:36,586
Come on! Come get me!

1507
01:44:36,670 --> 01:44:38,586
Aquí te lo tengo, man Come on!

1508
01:44:40,336 --> 01:44:41,336
Rudy.

1509
01:44:42,253 --> 01:44:43,336
Damn it!

1510
01:44:43,878 --> 01:44:44,878
Not!

1511
01:44:45,878 --> 01:44:47,628
Rudy!

1512
01:45:04,920 --> 01:45:08,670
Khaji-Yes!

1513
01:45:20,420 --> 01:45:22,753
Your OMAC has failed.

1514
01:45:22,836 --> 01:45:25,253
Jennifer, you don't know what OMAC is.

1515
01:45:25,336 --> 01:45:27,586
Carapax is just a prototype.

1516
01:45:27,670 --> 01:45:30,961
That's the only important thing.
The Code of Carabus.

1517
01:45:31,045 --> 01:45:34,545
With this, I can make a thousand Carapaxi.

1518
01:45:34,628 --> 01:45:36,795
It's the culmination of my life's work.

1519
01:45:36,920 --> 01:45:41,878
It's Kord's legacy. It is our heritage.

1520
01:45:42,711 --> 01:45:46,045
Not mine. I'll make sure of that.

1521
01:45:46,586 --> 01:45:51,461
You will coalesce
with that junk in Edge Key

1522
01:45:51,545 --> 01:45:53,420
instead of your family?

1523
01:45:55,503 --> 01:45:57,378
That trash from Edge Key

1524
01:45:57,545 --> 01:46:01,253
knows more about a family
than you will ever know.

1525
01:46:01,670 --> 01:46:04,253
I know. I know about family.

1526
01:46:04,336 --> 01:46:08,170
I know about my family,
who overlooked me

1527
01:46:08,253 --> 01:46:12,378
just like you are doing now
because you are just like your pitiful father.

1528
01:46:12,461 --> 01:46:17,170
Which he didn't have the courage to do
what was needed for the greater good.

1529
01:46:17,795 --> 01:46:21,253
I wish Ted was here now,
to see this.

1530
01:46:21,757 --> 01:46:23,050
(in italian)

1531
01:46:54,128 --> 01:46:56,336
Not! I'm not finished!

1532
01:47:02,753 --> 01:47:06,003
Jaime, the disarmed threat.

1533
01:47:06,086 --> 01:47:07,420
You lose control.

1534
01:47:08,003 --> 01:47:09,628
Do you think you could beat me?

1535
01:47:10,586 --> 01:47:13,378
You should have finished me
when you had the chance.

1536
01:47:16,670 --> 01:47:20,753
OMAC neutralized.
I recommend ceasing the attack.

1537
01:47:28,211 --> 01:47:29,795
What are you doing?

1538
01:47:29,878 --> 01:47:33,878
We are not murderers, Jaime. Let her go!

1539
01:47:34,711 --> 01:47:36,211
And dad?

1540
01:47:37,586 --> 01:47:39,420
And Rudy?

1541
01:47:40,086 --> 01:47:43,628
During transfer,
I unlocked his memories.

1542
01:47:44,336 --> 01:47:46,211
Let me show you.

1543
01:47:50,128 --> 01:47:52,128
What if he doesn't survive the operation?

1544
01:47:52,211 --> 01:47:53,795
Then we'll get another one.

1545
01:47:53,878 --> 01:47:54,961
It could kill him.

1546
01:47:55,045 --> 01:47:57,211
Sacrifices must be made
for the greater good.

1547
01:47:59,753 --> 01:48:02,420
This country is facing
with a brutal challenge,

1548
01:48:02,503 --> 01:48:06,920
from armed guerilla troops,
supported by others outside Guatemala.

1549
01:48:07,003 --> 01:48:10,336
The United States is determined
to restore democracy

1550
01:48:10,420 --> 01:48:13,961
and solve basic problems
of violent insurgency.

1551
01:48:14,045 --> 01:48:18,253
We know the problems in Guatemala.

1552
01:48:19,503 --> 01:48:21,545
Perfect! Collect them!

1553
01:48:31,670 --> 01:48:33,420
Mother!

1554
01:48:34,545 --> 01:48:36,670
Ignacio!

1555
01:48:57,878 --> 01:48:59,753
Now understand?

1556
01:49:11,753 --> 01:49:14,003
Hey! Cabezón!

1557
01:50:06,920 --> 01:50:08,253
You're wrong.

1558
01:50:11,086 --> 01:50:14,086
That love that I have
for my family...

1559
01:50:17,545 --> 01:50:19,545
that makes me strong.

1560
01:50:31,545 --> 01:50:33,753
Okay, give it to me! Come on!

1561
01:50:33,836 --> 01:50:35,420
- To stay?
- Yes, that one.

1562
01:50:40,128 --> 01:50:41,295
Not!

1563
01:50:41,378 --> 01:50:42,836
What you did?

1564
01:50:42,920 --> 01:50:45,253
Not! No no!

1565
01:50:45,336 --> 01:50:46,336
Jenny!

1566
01:50:47,920 --> 01:50:49,170
It's fine.

1567
01:50:49,836 --> 01:50:51,170
Carapax, kill them!

1568
01:50:51,253 --> 01:50:52,628
Kill them both!

1569
01:51:00,994 --> 01:51:02,663
(in italian)

1570
01:51:02,996 --> 01:51:03,705
(in italian)

1571
01:51:04,211 --> 01:51:05,378
Good.

1572
01:51:05,711 --> 01:51:07,045
What are you doing? We don't...

1573
01:51:07,128 --> 01:51:08,336
Good.

1574
01:51:09,795 --> 01:51:10,628
Not.

1575
01:51:10,711 --> 01:51:11,920
Wait, Jenny, wait!

1576
01:51:12,003 --> 01:51:13,729
Return to the Beetle Ship.
I'll come right away too.

1577
01:51:13,753 --> 01:51:14,878
- What the?
- I promise.

1578
01:51:15,336 --> 01:51:16,711
We can be partners.

1579
01:51:19,045 --> 01:51:21,711
I'll fix it. I'm going to direct you.

1580
01:51:21,795 --> 01:51:24,045
We can find another Sanchez.

1581
01:51:27,670 --> 01:51:30,086
Do you remember everything I did for you?

1582
01:51:34,027 --> 01:51:38,240
(in italian)

1583
01:51:43,128 --> 01:51:43,961
Khaji, what is he doing?

1584
01:51:44,045 --> 01:51:46,461
It maximizes its
the power reactor in the suit.

1585
01:51:46,545 --> 01:51:47,878
I advise you to move away.

1586
01:51:55,670 --> 01:51:56,753
Ignacio.

1587
01:52:00,470 --> 01:52:01,638
(in italian)

1588
01:52:03,795 --> 01:52:05,211
What the? What the?

1589
01:52:05,295 --> 01:52:07,670
What not! What are you doing?

1590
01:52:07,753 --> 01:52:10,086
Stop it! Not!

1591
01:52:10,856 --> 01:52:12,858
(in italian)

1592
01:52:14,336 --> 01:52:17,086
Sacrifices must be made
for the greater good.

1593
01:52:17,170 --> 01:52:19,128
Not! Please! Not!

1594
01:52:19,211 --> 01:52:21,586
Ignacio, no!

1595
01:52:21,670 --> 01:52:23,503
I suggest we run.

1596
01:52:24,045 --> 01:52:25,295
Good. Damn it!

1597
01:52:43,753 --> 01:52:45,378
Milagros, shoot!

1598
01:52:54,295 --> 01:52:55,670
Rocío!

1599
01:53:11,920 --> 01:53:13,128
Are you ok?

1600
01:53:36,170 --> 01:53:37,420
Miles

1601
01:53:39,336 --> 01:53:40,336
Cabezón.

1602
01:53:41,128 --> 01:53:42,128
Rudy?

1603
01:53:43,586 --> 01:53:44,586
Rudy?

1604
01:53:48,920 --> 01:53:50,920
- How?
- Yes. Know...

1605
01:53:51,081 --> 01:53:52,791
(in italian)

1606
01:54:02,676 --> 01:54:04,386
(in italian)

1607
01:54:30,545 --> 01:54:34,545
It's a delicate moment
for Kord Industries.

1608
01:54:34,628 --> 01:54:38,378
And of course we mourn
the loss of Victoria Kord.

1609
01:54:38,503 --> 01:54:40,170
But I look ahead.

1610
01:54:40,253 --> 01:54:43,920
As I said, we will no longer make weapons.

1611
01:54:44,003 --> 01:54:47,211
What I want to do
it's to honor my father's legacy.

1612
01:54:47,295 --> 01:54:50,503
It's not about destruction,
but of building a better future.

1613
01:54:50,586 --> 01:54:54,086
It's not about taking from the community,
but to give back to the community.

1614
01:55:04,920 --> 01:55:06,378
What are we going to do now?

1615
01:55:11,378 --> 01:55:12,836
Come on, Rudy, okay?

1616
01:55:14,378 --> 01:55:16,003
We'll get through this.
As always.

1617
01:55:17,920 --> 01:55:19,753
Hey! Reyes are here.

1618
01:55:20,961 --> 01:55:22,086
Hear...

1619
01:55:37,771 --> 01:55:39,690
(in italian)

1620
01:56:19,503 --> 01:56:20,545
Nana

1621
01:56:34,578 --> 01:56:36,663
(in italian)

1622
01:56:37,670 --> 01:56:39,711
Where? We don't have a house.

1623
01:56:39,795 --> 01:56:42,086
Rudy, one half of the Edge Keys
they are in our yard now.

1624
01:56:42,211 --> 01:56:43,670
They will certainly be happy to help us.

1625
01:56:43,753 --> 01:56:46,003
Yes, of course. Of course they will help.

1626
01:56:46,086 --> 01:56:50,211
- Yes, until when? Until Kord kicks us out?
- I wouldn't worry about that.

1627
01:56:51,295 --> 01:56:52,295
Jenny, Jenny.

1628
01:56:53,972 --> 01:56:55,641
(in italian)

1629
01:56:55,711 --> 01:56:59,253
I think it's time to bring back Edge Keys
to those who made it great.

1630
01:56:59,336 --> 01:57:02,670
Apparently the Reyes family is influencing her
a little Jenny Kord huh?

1631
01:57:02,753 --> 01:57:04,920
Kord has a lot to learn from Edge Keys.

1632
01:57:06,045 --> 01:57:07,211
Starting with you, Rudy.

1633
01:57:07,295 --> 01:57:10,086
- Wait, you told him to say that?
- Rudy, I didn't say anything.

1634
01:57:10,170 --> 01:57:12,378
Sounds like something you would tell him to tell me.

1635
01:57:12,461 --> 01:57:16,420
And don't worry! Kord Industries
he will fix it up and give you your house back.

1636
01:57:19,211 --> 01:57:20,461
Excuse me!

1637
01:57:21,128 --> 01:57:22,670
- Here you go!
- Thank you.

1638
01:57:22,753 --> 01:57:24,628
- Welcome, Rudy!
- What is this?

1639
01:57:24,753 --> 01:57:28,253
I felt very stupid,
so i bought you a new hatchback.

1640
01:57:32,128 --> 01:57:33,753
Do you like it sweetie?

1641
01:57:34,586 --> 01:57:36,920
Wow, it's blue. A bit obvious, right?

1642
01:57:37,003 --> 01:57:39,045
- Rudy.
- Rudy. "Thank you".

1643
01:57:39,128 --> 01:57:41,545
- I will think about it.
- Yes, look!

1644
01:57:41,628 --> 01:57:43,748
- Come on, help me like it.
- Okay, I inherit it.

1645
01:57:45,336 --> 01:57:46,878
OK I have to go.

1646
01:57:48,503 --> 01:57:49,545
Yes.

1647
01:57:50,170 --> 01:57:51,961
How about driving you?

1648
01:57:52,795 --> 01:57:54,711
- Yeah sure.
- Good.

1649
01:58:03,336 --> 01:58:07,420
And... when will I see you again?

1650
01:58:08,211 --> 01:58:10,295
Soon. I hope

1651
01:58:12,336 --> 01:58:13,336
Where are you going?

1652
01:58:14,128 --> 01:58:15,503
Dad's home.

1653
01:58:15,878 --> 01:58:18,211
I want to look at my mother's paintings again.

1654
01:58:19,420 --> 01:58:21,253
I forgot how beautiful they are.

1655
01:58:21,878 --> 01:58:23,170
Good. Good.

1656
01:58:27,378 --> 01:58:28,670
What if I took you?

1657
01:58:35,586 --> 01:58:36,670
How?

1658
01:58:36,753 --> 01:58:39,211
I can feel your blood rushing
in the middle part.

1659
01:58:39,295 --> 01:58:40,420
Finish!

1660
01:58:41,836 --> 01:58:43,003
No no no. Not you.

1661
01:58:48,670 --> 01:58:49,670
What does it say?

1662
01:58:49,753 --> 01:58:50,961
Nothing.

1663
01:59:18,878 --> 01:59:19,878
Good.

1664
01:59:20,670 --> 01:59:21,670
Hold on!

1665
01:59:23,586 --> 01:59:24,753
Good.

1666
02:00:57,003 --> 02:00:59,003
Hello? Hello?

1667
02:00:59,086 --> 02:01:01,170
God, it works! Good.

1668
02:01:01,586 --> 02:01:05,461
Whoever turned on my computer
to give a message to my daughter Jenny.

1669
02:01:05,545 --> 02:01:06,628
Jenny Kord.

1670
02:01:07,170 --> 02:01:09,753
Please tell her I love her

1671
02:01:09,836 --> 02:01:11,378
and that I'm sorry

1672
02:01:11,461 --> 02:01:14,211
and that her father is alive.

1673
02:01:15,461 --> 02:01:18,461
Ted Kord is alive.

1674
02:06:51,253 --> 02:06:53,253
TRANSLATION AND ADAPTATION
ANDREA PUTICIU

1675
02:07:16,628 --> 02:07:18,545
Oh, that's sexy!
