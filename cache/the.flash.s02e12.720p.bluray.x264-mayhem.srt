1
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:06,136
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:10,181
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

3
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:13,097
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

4
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:16,437
I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.

5
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:18,773
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

6
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:22,236
but in doing so,
I opened up our world to new threats.

7
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:25,446
And I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

8
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:28,112
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:30,246
Previously on The Flash...

10
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:33,333
Is this why you came to Central City?
This nonsense?

11
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:35,210
I don't actually have to
explain myself to you.

12
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:36,461
This is illegal. I'm a cop.

13
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,293
The detective who didn't know
he had a son.

14
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:40,924
I saw Mom today.
She says you haven't been by in a while.

15
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:42,585
She thinks it's because
you're angry with her.

16
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:43,752
I have every right to be angry.

17
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:45,762
- I'm leaving Central City.
- What?

18
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:47,764
I was accepted into
the Forensic Science program

19
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:49,140
at Midway City University.

20
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:50,801
We got Turtle locked up in the pipeline.

21
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:53,596
All we gotta do is use him to figure out
how to steal Zoom's speed,

22
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:55,014
and then we'll get your daughter back.

23
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,023
That might take longer than we thought.

24
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:58,308
Because Tunfle's dead.

25
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,193
Now decide.

26
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:03,447
In return for your daughter's life.

27
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:06,654
I will help you steal The Flash's speed.

28
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:11,822
People think of tar now as
mainly a roofing product.

29
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:13,491
Fun fact, it's also been used as

30
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:16,206
medicine and flavoring for
candy and liquor.

31
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:19,963
I bet what you're thinking right now
isn't "yummy," is it?

32
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:22,667
What I hope you're thinking is,

33
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:26,963
"Wow. Clay is serious about wanting
to know where I put that money."

34
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,592
"I think I'll give him
that account number now"

35
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:31,429
"so he doesn't drop me
into this vat of boiling tar."

36
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:34,845
Hmm. I'm sorry, what?

37
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:40,643
Central City Bank, account
five-four-six-three-seven-two-eight.

38
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:45,697
Please. Please, pull me up now.
I'm so sorry...

39
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,954
I thought you said
you weren't gonna kill him.

40
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:55,870
I say a lot of things.

41
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:00,121
Where's Joey?

42
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:02,210
Wishing he were somewhere else. Let's go.

43
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:05,342
Get in the car, let's go!

44
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:08,132
Drive! Drive, man!

45
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,209
There's this song lyric I like,

46
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:45,750
"All the broken hearts
in the world still beat."

47
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,802
Mine's beating, but bruised.

48
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,507
Hopefully, not for long.

49
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:54,429
The one thing I do know is
time changes everything.

50
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,219
I didn't think about

51
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:58,933
how many crazy things police see.

52
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:00,393
And can't unsee.

53
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,565
- You always wanna be a cop?
- Yeah.

54
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:05,068
My dad was one, he was my hero, so...

55
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:06,729
I never thought of being anything else.

56
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,738
- What about you?
- No, uh...

57
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,899
I wanted to be an astronaut.

58
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:12,742
- Wait, that's what Barry wanted to be.
- Mmm.

59
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,653
Really? Well, probably not
for the same reasons.

60
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,164
Going to space is like the fastest
a human being can go.

61
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:19,871
So it was either an astronaut or, like...

62
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,910
- Have you heard of scramjets?
- Mmm-mmm.

63
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:25,381
Okay. They're like supersonic
on oxygen, dude.

64
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:26,540
It's nuts.

65
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,630
You're right.
Not the same reason as Barry.

66
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:30,920
You are really all about the speed, huh?

67
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:32,258
Yeah, I mean, it's what I love.

68
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:34,094
Is that why you're still drag racing?

69
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:38,803
You are, aren't you?

70
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:40,846
Isn't that a little dangerous?

71
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,431
Yeah.

72
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:44,770
For the people that race against me.
Sure is.

73
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:49,025
Look, thanks for the hang, but I gotta go.

74
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,947
It's early. Don't leave yet.

75
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:52,779
No, I got some stuff to do.

76
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:54,609
I'll see you later.

77
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,251
Why'd you do that?

78
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:05,705
"Thanks for the hang"?

79
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:08,165
Is he your son
or your age-inappropriate buddy?

80
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:12,052
Look, I know the dynamic is weird.
I'm just trying to figure it out.

81
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,963
From my perspective, it seems like
you're ignoring something that could...

82
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,098
Oh, I don't know, get Wally killed.

83
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:20,511
The fact that Wally even wants to
get to know me is the big win here.

84
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,601
So, in the future, could you try
not chasing him out of the house?

85
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:26,187
Look, Dad, I'll play along
if that's what you want.

86
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:30,024
But which "you," exactly,
are you trying to let him get to know?

87
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,607
Because the person that I saw tonight?

88
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:34,775
I don't recognize that dad.

89
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:42,658
Journal entry one-fourteen.
Turtle's brain.

90
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:44,376
So...

91
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:48,209
What I learned from
Turtle's brain matter and

92
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,207
the Reverse-Flash, as it turns out,

93
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,046
has allowed me to complete a device that,

94
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:55,713
when installed inside the Flash's suit,

95
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:57,886
will let me harness his speed,

96
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:02,554
so that the next time
he taps into the Speed Force,

97
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:09,063
I can begin the collection.

98
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:13,397
I wish there were another way,
but there's not.

99
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:15,941
- Oh, Hey.
- Hey.

100
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,404
You're here late.

101
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,703
As are you. Shouldn't you be 0ut...

102
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,281
Doing whatever it is

103
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,075
that twenty-six-year-olds do
on a Thursday night?

104
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:27,411
- Um, I am recently single.
- Ah.

105
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:30,418
So I thought I would tackle
the breach problem,

106
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,708
and see if I could figure out
how to close them.

107
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,918
- Looks like you had the same idea.
- Oh. Right.

108
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:38,255
I work better alone.

109
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,844
No. Haven't you heard the expression,
"Two heads are better than one"?

110
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,759
- No.
- Must be an Earth-1 thing.

111
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,266
You understand, for me,
that my earth is Earth-1.

112
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:46,930
- Yeah.
- Your earth has yet to create

113
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:48,349
CFL Quark Matter, and so it would

114
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:49,937
take you too long
to catch up on the science.

115
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,444
So I'll do it by myself.

116
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:56,280
- This science?
- Yes, that science.

117
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,151
Watch this.

118
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:05,658
That's annoying.

119
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,334
Wow. All right, I'm all caught up.

120
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,461
Forthe next, like, 30 minutes,
give or take.

121
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:12,418
Looks like I missed one, though.

122
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,466
All right. You can assist.

123
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,168
But I'm in charge.

124
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:17,961
Yeah, you're in charge.

125
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,233
Check that out!

126
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,399
Uh...

127
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:43,988
What the hell are you doing here?
Aside from trying to send me to therapy?

128
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:45,656
I told you I did some research.

129
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:48,746
I thought it would be a good idea
for a story for the paper.

130
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:52,413
Plus, I thought this would be a great way
for us to really get to know each other.

131
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:57,676
I mean, I want to know what's so great
about this that you can't let go, bro.

132
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:01,092
No one here is eager to get their picture
in the paper, you got me?

133
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,596
In which part of the paper?

134
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:06,347
The part where they put the mug shots
or in the back, in the obituary section?

135
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,682
Yo, why don't you just take
a page out of your dad's book,

136
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,438
let me do what I'm gonna do, okay?

137
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:11,769
I don't need a big sister.

138
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,605
I know, you're gonna need an undertaker.

139
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,023
Last race of the night, people.

140
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:19,531
Our reigning champ, Tail Lights!

141
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,279
Oh...

142
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:29,791
What? No "good luck"?

143
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,937
We'll have
the latest on Oliver Queen's

144
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,818
mayoral campaign coming up.

145
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:59,571
In local news, Roofing Tar Industries,

146
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,652
which was devastated by the S.T.A.R. Labs

147
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:04,489
Particle Accelerator explosion
two years ago,

148
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,904
is finally set to reopen.

149
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:16,580
Guys! Clean up before you leave!

150
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,938
Two years!

151
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:40,612
Two years I was trapped in the ground.

152
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,272
In that blackness.

153
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:43,611
I couldn't see.

154
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,320
I couldn't feel.

155
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,785
But I could still hate.

156
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:51,619
Joey?

157
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:52,873
Did you ever wonder what it felt like

158
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:55,502
when you dropped me
in that vat of boiling tar?

159
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:57,962
Since I went in head-first,

160
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:00,920
I actually felt my ears and nose burn off.

161
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,631
The pain of my eyeballs searing
was unimaginable.

162
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:06,512
But it was the way
that it burned down my throat

163
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:10,801
as I tried to breathe
that I thought was really special.

164
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:12,726
Please.

165
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,764
Why don't I Just show you?

166
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:25,907
- Excuse me. Barr, you good?
- Hey.

167
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:27,821
Yeah. Yeah, no, it'sjust...

168
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,328
You know, it's weird Patty's not here.

169
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,826
Just not for the same reasons,
but I miss Patty, too.

170
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:34,157
What have we got?

171
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:37,328
Uh, victim's name is Daniel Burge.

172
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:39,371
Not exactly a boy scout,

173
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:43,337
but managed to
buy this garage two years ago.

174
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,052
It looks like he was dipped in a volcano.

175
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,179
Oh, yeah.

176
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:51,425
Actually, the depth and uniformity
of the burn pattern

177
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:54,344
is something you would see if the body was

178
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:57,685
covered in something like lava
but with a lower burn temp.

179
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,895
And an added chemical characteristic.

180
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:02,811
The fire investigator didn't find
a secondary accelerant.

181
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:04,984
Yeah, he probably wouldn't, with a meta.

182
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:08,032
All right, I'm gonna take
a sample back to S.T.A.R. Labs,

183
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:09,613
have Cisco run some tests.

184
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:11,528
Good. I'm gonna go meet Iris for lunch.

185
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,196
She wants to talk to me about Wally.

186
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:15,081
Yeah, how's that going? You and him?

187
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,038
Great! Well, good.

188
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:19,206
I don't know, baby steps.

189
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:20,621
I'm trying to give him space.

190
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:24,291
I mean, hejust lost his mom,
just met me and his sister.

191
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:25,833
He's got a lot on his plate.

192
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,885
Yeah, hejust found the best dad
he could've wished for.

193
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,796
Oh, you say that now,
but you didn't always think that.

194
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,466
Well, you were pretty strict,
that's for sure.

195
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,259
But strict isn't always a bad thing,

196
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,052
especially when you know
it's coming from love.

197
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:39,894
- L'll talk to you later.
- Yeah.

198
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,234
Ugh. It's disgusting.

199
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,201
Okay. Now, click here.

200
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:04,919
Bam! That's my app. See?
The app just went live.

201
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:13,803
So, you can sync up all social media
postings about meta-human activity.

202
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:15,763
Somebody sees something cray
in Central City?

203
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,223
- I get an alert about it.
- Yo, man.

204
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:19,853
You have too much time on your hands.

205
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,560
Oh, I thought you were
going to say it was cool.

206
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,657
I'm just saying, you can't judge me.

207
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,409
Didn't your girlfriend just
break up with you?

208
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:35,536
- Yeah?
- Pretty sure she just did.

209
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:36,821
Hey, Harry.

210
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:39,624
Wait, so if that app gives you
eyes and ears all over the city,

211
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,205
then why don't you use it
to find the next Ms. Right?

212
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,625
- Did I Just make the meta-human Tinder?
- Mmm-hmm.

213
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,331
Nope. Not starting that fetish.

214
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:49,091
Stop checking your profile.
This is not a place for that.

215
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:52,880
Hey, baby.

216
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:54,218
Hey.

217
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,968
- Looks like you're working hard.
- I am.

218
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:00,429
I'm researching a story.

219
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:02,146
One that you'll find

220
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:04,148
- interesting, actually.
- Mmm.

221
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,069
This is Curran Roberts.

222
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,611
After his head went through
the windshield of his hot-rod,

223
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:14,117
he was in a coma for six months.

224
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:18,162
This kid, he died.

225
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:22,334
He wrapped his car around a tree
at a 110 miles per hour.

226
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:25,959
They were all street racers, Dad,
and Wally could be the next one.

227
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:30,425
What do you want me to do, Iris,
lock him up?

228
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,548
Or stop the races.

229
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,757
Look, I learned a long time ago,

230
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,593
you can't stop your kids
from being who they are.

231
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,048
Really?

232
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,226
Why won't you be his parent, Dad?

233
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:42,265
What are you so afraid of?

234
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,104
All right, you're right.

235
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:45,686
I'm afraid.

236
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:48,936
I'm afraid he'll reject me. Us.

237
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:51,150
Look, the last time
I confronted him about the races,

238
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,655
it didn't go so well, remember?

239
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:54,441
And I need it to go well with Wally.

240
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,359
I mean, after all these years lost,

241
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:58,324
lwant him in our lives.

242
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:03,249
Look, let me get him to trust me.

243
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:06,244
Then I can do something about it.

244
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,087
Okay.

245
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:12,250
Oh...

246
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,552
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

247
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:15,883
What's the matter?

248
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,338
Um...

249
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:20,718
No... I jus... I can't remember,
is the helicity of a particle left-handed

250
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:23,056
If its spin and motion is
the same or opposite?

251
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,062
- It's...
- No, hold on! lgot it, hold on,

252
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,473
I'll find the answer to that.

253
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,233
Opposite. I knew that.

254
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:35,319
You know that's really annoying.

255
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,654
It's... You know, just gotta,

256
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,070
recharge the old short-term
every once in a while.

257
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,536
- You know, this feels like old times.
- Okay.

258
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:50,251
Yeah, I mean, I know, obviously,
this is our first time working together,

259
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:53,257
but I am learning a lot from you.

260
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:56,590
The last Wells was a real mentor.

261
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:59,506
He believed that I could do anything,
made me believe it.

262
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:02,759
- Okay.
- He opened up whole new worlds to me.

263
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:05,596
Guess he really was
like another father, almost.

264
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,431
- Stop n, all right?
- What?

265
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:10,396
I did not ask for your help, okay?

266
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,686
I certainly did not ask to be your mentor!

267
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:14,612
Okay, relax. I wasjust talking ab0ut...

268
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:16,648
You know what, I have a kid already,
I don't need another one.

269
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:19,112
So, scram. Let me finish this by myself.

270
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:22,954
All right.

271
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,129
Hey, I ran your crime scene sample
six ways from Sunday...

272
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,965
- What's wrong with you?
- I just...

273
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,593
Nothing. What's up?

274
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:42,174
Two things, very strange.

275
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,468
One, definitely meta-human cells
in the oil.

276
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:47,683
And two, he didn't die from his burns.
It was suffocation.

277
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,142
Suffocation?

278
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,524
That makes sense, actually.

279
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:54,060
The burns indicated that the body
was covered in something.

280
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,654
Cross-referencing O2 levels
in the organic matter,

281
00:14:56,813 --> 00:15:00,192
I found a direct match to animals trapped
and preserved in an asphalt seep.

282
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:01,826
The guy was fossilized.

283
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,152
Whoa.

284
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:07,158
So, whoever killed him
is like a walking tar...

285
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:10,668
Tar pit. Mmm, too slow. It's okay.

286
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:14,589
So, he's basically drowning them in tar.

287
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:17,171
God, that's a horror show.

288
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,502
Why did he target Daniel Burge?

289
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:24,428
Oh, it's my meta-human social media app.
That's right.

290
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,552
There's an attack in progress,
Sixth and Bell, downtown.

291
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,382
Remember me, Clay?

292
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,386
We killed you.

293
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:06,470
I bet right now
you're not thinking... "Yummy."

294
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,602
Oh, you guys seeing this?

295
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,350
Oh, Yeah. We see it.

296
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:21,614
All right. Any ideas?

297
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:23,991
The viscosity of asphalt lowers
as its temperature lowers...

298
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,151
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And it hardens.

299
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,241
Hey! Find a way to cool him down!

300
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:36,709
Hey, Barbecue! Hit me with your best shot!

301
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,388
Oh, yeah! Team Flash!

302
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,064
Hey, buddy.

303
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:58,818
I've got some questions for you. Let's go.

304
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,776
You're coming home, Jesse.

305
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:08,779
You're coming home.

306
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:15,664
All right, so Tar Pit...
"Tar Pit," that's what we're calling him?

307
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:19,171
- That's right.
- Tar Pit, uh, was after one Clay Stanley.

308
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:21,378
Stanley, as it turns out,
is a suspected hitman

309
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,384
that the C.C.P.D.
has been trying to track for a while.

310
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,136
But they haven't been able to
make anything stick.

311
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,467
No pun intended.

312
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,348
Do we know why he was attacked?

313
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:32,519
Stanley wouldn't answer any of my
questions. He was pretty scared.

314
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:34,679
When a hitman is scared,
you know something's wrong.

315
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:36,472
Hey, did you get an ID on our meta-human?

316
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:37,811
Yeah, I'm running it through

317
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:40,147
five different facial-recognition systems
right now.

318
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,401
So, it should take a minute.

319
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:45,732
And there it is. Who's the best hacker
in the world, people?

320
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,320
- Felicity Smoak.
- Felicity Smoak.

321
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:49,615
What is wrong with you two?
That's not friendship.

322
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,156
Our meta-human's name
is Joseph Monteleone.

323
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,074
Oh, he looks friendly.

324
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:57,084
Monteleone was reported missing...

325
00:17:57,243 --> 00:18:00,463
Surprise, surprise, the night of the
particle accelerator explosion.

326
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:03,500
And what's the connection between
Monteleone and the two victims?

327
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,674
I'll call Joe, have him run
background checks on all three guys.

328
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:08,554
Okay, I'm gonna run some tests
on the tar sample,

329
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:10,340
see if I can find his weakness.

330
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,972
Hey. You feeling okay?

331
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:19,686
Yeah. Why?

332
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:20,850
You're going slower than normal.

333
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:22,940
You clocked in at 1415 miles an hour.

334
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,570
I'm sorry. How fast do I usually run?

335
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:26,481
1500. Are you getting enough to eat?

336
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,570
Yes! Yeah, dude. I'm fine. Seriously.

337
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:30,076
The difference seems negligible.

338
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:31,823
Fast is fast, right?

339
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:35,240
- See ya.
- Yeah.

340
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:44,040
Just overtake him, you idiot.

341
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:51,547
Clark Bronwen?

342
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:53,387
Who's asking?

343
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:54,717
Oh...

344
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,562
You're that chick
who was hanging around Tail Lights.

345
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:05,236
I'm a reporter for CCPN.

346
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,696
I want you to stop holding the races.

347
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:12,327
Sweetheart, unless you can find
me another way to make five grand a night,

348
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:13,987
it ain't gonna happen.

349
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:20,334
Here's a preview of the expose
that I am writing.

350
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:21,915
You are the star of the piece.

351
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:25,214
I had a little chat with
some of your previous associates

352
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:27,467
and dug up some revealing details
about you.

353
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:30,720
Like the gambling rings you run
or the thefts you've been involved with.

354
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:34,090
I'm sure the C.C.P.D.
will be interested in this one.

355
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,884
You're forgetting something in here.

356
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:40,138
Aggravated assault.

357
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:43,771
You think you're the only one
that can play this game?

358
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,109
I can find out where you live,

359
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,771
what you eat, when you sleep...

360
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:51,316
Every little detail about your life.

361
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:53,859
Hmm?

362
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:58,247
Publish that trash,
we'll see what happens to you.

363
00:19:58,531 --> 00:19:59,532
Mmm.

364
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:06,381
This entire conversation is being recorded
and sent to CCPN.

365
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,545
If you or any one of your people
lay a hand on me,

366
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,382
my colleagues will send this
to the cops immediately.

367
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,464
Get out of my office.

368
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:26,893
You got a death wish?

369
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:29,650
You are not the first person to
accuse me of that, so maybe.

370
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,527
Going down there? Threatening them?

371
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,488
These people, Iris, they live in the dark.

372
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,822
They're cockroaches.

373
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:37,737
Except they don't scatter
when someone turns on the lights.

374
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:38,950
They're looking to bite.

375
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:41,912
If they are so dangerous, Wally,
then why are you in so deep with them?

376
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:43,617
I'm not.

377
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:44,952
I can stop when I want.

378
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:46,666
So why don't you?

379
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:48,380
You said that you were only street racing

380
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:50,883
to earn money
for Francine's medical bills.

381
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,418
Well, there are no medical bills anymore.

382
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,178
So why are you still doing it?

383
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:57,181
Look, I am not gonna pretend

384
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,558
that Francine meant to me
what she did to you.

385
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:01,264
But in the short time
that I got to spend with her,

386
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,429
I saw what kind of person she had become.

387
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,353
She was smart and kind and loving.

388
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:09,234
So I can't even imagine
how much you miss her.

389
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,237
You don't know what I'm feeling.

390
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:14,190
Well, let me tell you how I feel.

391
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:17,910
I know that you are trying really hard to
convince everyone that you are a badass,

392
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:20,321
but I know that you're a good kid, Wally.

393
00:21:20,488 --> 00:21:22,240
And you didn't get that way
raising yourself.

394
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,204
You had a single mother who cared for you.

395
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,835
So my dad and I care
whether you wrap yourself around a tree

396
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:28,792
or get shot by one of these gangsters.

397
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:34,006
Having someone care about your well-being
cannot be a new sensation for you.

398
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:41,892
Show up there again
and I won't be able to protect you.

399
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,779
I'm just going over some research.

400
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:57,074
Ten-year-old determination.

401
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:59,072
What?

402
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:01,870
When my daughter was ten, she...

403
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,409
Science teacher had her do a project.
You know, this...

404
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:09,203
Project... I spent
every waking hourtinkering,

405
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:12,340
perfecting her solar-powered oven.

406
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:14,124
Mmm.

407
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:18,175
Anyway, ten-year-old determination.
You remind me of her.

408
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:24,263
Did you scold her as well?

409
00:22:27,555 --> 00:22:28,727
- Yes.
- Mmm.

410
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,686
Look, I know that this has been
hard for you.

411
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:35,275
But you're not in it alone.

412
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:37,735
Yes, I am, Allen. Yes, I am. I...

413
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:40,025
As much as you all want me
to be part of your team,

414
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,444
that's never going to happen.

415
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:44,284
I'm always going to be a father first.

416
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:46,449
And one day,

417
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:49,585
Zoom is gonna make me choose
between you and my daughter,

418
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:51,791
and every time,
unblinkingly, unflinchingly,

419
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:54,958
I would choose my daughter.
I will betray you.

420
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:59,466
That's binary thinking.
It doesn't have to be either-or.

421
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:02,177
Life is either-or.

422
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,559
Yes-no. Black-white. Love...

423
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:07,268
Hate.

424
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:10,056
From the dawn of time,
till this moment right now.

425
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:15,026
I guess I Just have more faith in you
than you have in yourself.

426
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:18,196
And by the way,
I came up with an idea, or...

427
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:23,490
A notion, rather, on how we could
close the breaches for good.

428
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:31,744
This is...

429
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:36,169
- This... Who wrote this?
- You did.

430
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:39,218
Yeah, the other you.

431
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:42,346
Evil, not stupid.

432
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:44,678
I think the answer might be in the

433
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,434
electromagnetic insulator
of the quark matter.

434
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:51,476
Like I said, we are a team.

435
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,312
I'm gonna take a look at this.

436
00:23:57,645 --> 00:24:00,740
I'm gonna stick around,
run some computer sims on the formula.

437
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,325
See you tonight.

438
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:06,199
Yeah, see you later.

439
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:26,386
Drink up.

440
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:42,071
Had enough?

441
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:44,529
Not even close.

442
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:46,911
Give me back my daughter
and I'll get you the rest.

443
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:51,074
You're not in a position to negotiate.

444
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,742
You won't kill me.

445
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,080
And you won't kill my daughter.

446
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:57,087
Because if you do,
then you won't get what you want.

447
00:24:57,246 --> 00:25:00,125
I don't need to kill your daughter...

448
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:04,345
I can torture her,

449
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:09,009
bring her right up to the edge of death,

450
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:15,265
so I can do it again
the next day and the next...

451
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:18,901
Bring me the rest of Flash's speed.

452
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:34,954
Hey.

453
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:38,254
I ran background checks on everyone
involved in this Tar Pit mess,

454
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:40,005
came up empty.
I mean, they all have records,

455
00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:42,292
but they're sealed, so... Can't read them.

456
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:45,302
Well, that's 'cause you're bound
by ethics, Detective West.

457
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:48,556
How many felonies are we committing
breaking into sealed court records?

458
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:51,391
Three or four. No, five.

459
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,975
Well, they were sealed because
the records are all juvenile offenses.

460
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:56,229
They weren't arrested together.

461
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,435
No, but look at this.

462
00:25:57,598 --> 00:25:59,692
They served in the same
juvenile detention facility.

463
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:02,569
Actually, Monteleone and victim one
were bunkmates.

464
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:04,651
Who do we have shackeol up with vic two?

465
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,694
Bronwen, comma, Clark.

466
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:08,700
Well, good luck finding him,
he has a ton of addresses,

467
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:10,657
and I can't seem to find anything current.

468
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,742
I'll run his picture through
facial recognition.

469
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:14,327
That won't be necessary.

470
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,709
In this case, I am facial recognition.

471
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:18,835
I know exactly where we can find that guy.

472
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:21,080
And, Dad, you are not gonna like how.

473
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,378
Okay, you can tell me about it on the way.

474
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:26,752
What is that?

475
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:28,554
Breach implosion reactor.

476
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:29,846
Sorry I asked.

477
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:32,053
- You ready?
- Yeah, let's do it.

478
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:34,093
Have fun fixing the universe, you two.

479
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,728
Hey, Harry. What's going on?
You seem like you're in pain.

480
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,098
No, no. I have a headache.

481
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:43,026
- If our calculations are correct...
- And they are.

482
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:45,563
And they are. When this device detonates,

483
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:48,528
it'll collapse the event horizon
on this side of the breach,

484
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:52,365
thereby shutting off any connection
to Earth-2 permanently.

485
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:55,697
You Okay?

486
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:56,956
Yeah, I'm just a little tired.

487
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:58,743
I don't feel like myself.
I'm good, though.

488
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:01,829
Yeah.

489
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:05,716
- It's gonna work, Harry.
- Yeah. Yeah. Okay, you ready?

490
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,376
Yeah, give it to me.

491
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:22,141
Come on!

492
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:30,320
We did it!

493
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:33,573
Come on!
You just rewrote the laws of physics.

494
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:35,408
Don't smile or anything.

495
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:36,947
I guess that was pretty cool.

496
00:27:37,114 --> 00:27:38,707
Yeah, I'd say so.

497
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:40,368
One down, 51 to go.

498
00:27:41,535 --> 00:27:42,707
Yeah.

499
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:44,664
Allen...

500
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,206
Yeah?

501
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:47,708
Thank you.

502
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:50,003
It's just the first step in
getting your daughter back.

503
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:52,759
Come on!

504
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:04,941
Welcome to the wrong side
of the wrong side of the tracks.

505
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,443
So where's Clark?

506
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:08,278
- That's him.
- Oh.

507
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:13,442
Come on, man!

508
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:17,780
There's Wally.

509
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:23,581
Now, if our fly flag girl can step up,

510
00:28:23,744 --> 00:28:25,417
we're ready to begin!

511
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,482
What the...

512
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:55,943
- Call Barry!
- Okay.

513
00:28:57,527 --> 00:29:00,246
You good? You've been a little quiet
ever since we closed the breach.

514
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:01,873
Listen, Allen, I ha...

515
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:04,410
Hey, sorry. lt's... Real quick.

516
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,328
Hey, let me call you back, Iris, I...

517
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:09,415
I gotta go.

518
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:20,743
Iris!

519
00:30:22,404 --> 00:30:24,077
Get her to the hospital!

520
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:43,426
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.

521
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,017
You all right?

522
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:46,978
What happened?

523
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:49,106
Piece of glass from that car

524
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:50,641
- pierced your shoulder.
- Mmm.

525
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:52,605
But you're gonna be all right.

526
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:55,608
I hate hospitals.

527
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:02,114
Wally, hi.

528
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:04,996
Hey. Can I come in?

529
00:31:05,906 --> 00:31:06,907
Uh...

530
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:08,746
I got you some flowers.

531
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:11,708
I don't know what kind or anything...
I Just...

532
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:14,623
Or maybe you're allergic.

533
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,258
Is she allergic to flowers?

534
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,961
No, I'm not, Wally. Thank you.

535
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,588
Cool. Uh...

536
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:25,642
I'll just leave them here.

537
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:35,986
It's okay, Wally.

538
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,783
Um, feel better.

539
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:43,865
I'll be back.

540
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:47,448
Hey. Hey, hold up a minute.

541
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:48,661
I got somewhere to be.

542
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:50,167
Yeah, you do.

543
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:51,998
At your sister's bedside.

544
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:55,042
Iris came to that race last night
because she cares about you.

545
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:57,837
Look man, this ain't on me.
I didn't tell her to go to that race.

546
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:59,967
Look, I know you didn't.
This ain't a blame thing.

547
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:01,504
Just hear me out, okay?

548
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:07,138
Look, I know you've just lost your mother,

549
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,598
you've just found us,
it's been like a whirlwind.

550
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,514
Now I can't tell you
how to live your life,

551
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:15,355
but I can tell you this, you're not alone.

552
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:20,109
You have people that sit up at night
worried sick about you.

553
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:22,695
And they're not gonna stop
worrying about you.

554
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:25,990
That's what a family does.

555
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,037
They put up with each other.

556
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:30,665
And they put each other first,
before ourselves.

557
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:32,621
So you're not mad at me?

558
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,166
For being reckless with your life? Yeah.

559
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,545
Hell, yeah, I'm mad at you.

560
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:39,049
But I'm more mad at myself
for being something I'm not.

561
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:41,505
I'm not your friend, Wally.

562
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:43,549
I'm your father.

563
00:32:45,172 --> 00:32:46,469
And I ain't letting you go.

564
00:32:48,175 --> 00:32:49,222
Okay.

565
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,146
It's Barry.

566
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:56,900
Go. I'll stay with her.

567
00:32:57,476 --> 00:32:58,648
You sure?

568
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:01,571
She's my sister, right?

569
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:03,986
That's my boy.

570
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:11,618
Don't worry. We're gonna get him.

571
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:13,250
I'm sorry, dude. What?

572
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:14,576
Tar Pit.

573
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:16,871
You shouldn't worry.
We're gonna get him. With these.

574
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:19,964
With these nitrous grenades.

575
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:23,502
Each of these has 10 times the
concentration of a hot-rod's nitrous tank,

576
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,170
and is triggered by extreme heat.

577
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:28,762
We're talking 650 degrees,
that's the boiling point of asphalt.

578
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:32,178
So, one of these puppies makes contact?

579
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,475
You got a Tar Pit popsicle for dessert.

580
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,898
All right. That's great. Um...

581
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:38,768
Hey, look.

582
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,773
I think that maybe you were right.

583
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:43,109
I felt slower tonight.

584
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:44,773
You know, not by much, but enough.

585
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,692
Do you think there's something wrong
with the suit, maybe?

586
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,235
It's unlikely.

587
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:49,948
The readings from the suit are normal.

588
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,237
You know I take care of that thing.

589
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:53,406
Yeah, what? Am I sick?

590
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,788
I don't know. Do you feel any different?

591
00:33:56,451 --> 00:34:00,672
No. Not really. I mean,
I know that I'm slower in the moment,

592
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,924
but I can't tell by how much.

593
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:04,380
Two percent.

594
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,713
Tests on the components in your blood
show the Speed Force

595
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,348
at a 100% for the last 60 days.

596
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:12,760
Until today. lt dropped to 98.

597
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:14,473
Zoom stole Jay's speed.

598
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:16,809
Do you think maybe
during your fight with Zoom,

599
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:18,064
yours might have diminished?

600
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:19,270
But that was weeks ago.

601
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:21,935
Why would I Just be feeling
those effects now?

602
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:23,441
- Doctor Wells.
- Yeah?

603
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:25,856
You've studied the Speed Force
more than anyone.

604
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:27,615
What do you think could have happened?

605
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:29,492
It could be any number of things.

606
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,032
Yeah, all right...

607
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:37,163
It's just... Look, I mean,
Iris could've died tonight.

608
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,702
She's gonna be okay, Barry.

609
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:42,589
You know, this time. But the fact is,
she is hurt right now because of me.

610
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:46,718
I wasn't fast enough to protect Iris
just from some meta-human tonight.

611
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:51,674
When Zoom attacks again,
I need all of my speed, and then some.

612
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:55,344
I can't lose anyone else.

613
00:34:58,179 --> 00:34:59,396
You won't.

614
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:03,523
- I did it.
- What?

615
00:35:09,149 --> 00:35:10,571
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What is that?

616
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:17,874
I stole your speed.

617
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:20,543
I gave it to Zoom.

618
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:24,502
No. This isn't...
What, are... You're working with Zoom?

619
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:26,041
No. Not at first.

620
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,964
We trusted you. I trusted you!

621
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:32,888
Joe, stop!

622
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,097
Why'd you put him in there?

623
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:42,436
Because if I didn't,
lwould've killed him.

624
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:44,351
Now, let's go find this tar freak.

625
00:35:57,947 --> 00:36:00,075
- Yo! What the hell, man!
- Shut up.

626
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:02,711
I thought I was being transferred.

627
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:06,082
You're not being transferred.
You're the bait.

628
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:08,041
What?

629
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:19,473
This is for two years ago, Clay!

630
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:40,157
Stay.

631
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:57,382
You know, it's ironic.

632
00:36:57,674 --> 00:37:00,769
I wasjust saying how much you remind me
of the old Wells.

633
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:03,851
And now, here we are,
just like I did with him,

634
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:08,268
standing on either side of this glass
with me asking you why.

635
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,858
I'm doing what I have to do
to save my daughter.

636
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,397
Yeah, at any cost, right?

637
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:13,690
At the cost of Joe's daughter?

638
00:37:13,857 --> 00:37:16,485
I told you I would betray you.

639
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:19,329
I told you I would have to choose.

640
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:20,659
You chose wrong.

641
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:24,409
Really, Detective?
Because I just sacrificed my daughter.

642
00:37:24,701 --> 00:37:27,671
Because I Just sentenced my daughter
to death to save your son.

643
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:29,081
You want a pat on the back?

644
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,749
I want you to send me home.

645
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:33,634
Send me back to Earth-2.

646
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:35,215
Think about it.

647
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:37,927
Zoom wants you to get faster,

648
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:41,559
he wants you to have more Speed Force
in you for when he finally takes it.

649
00:37:41,718 --> 00:37:44,517
Send me back, use the Implosion Reactor
to shut down the breach.

650
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,602
Shut down all the breaches.

651
00:37:46,848 --> 00:37:48,191
Close them all.

652
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:53,321
And Zoom will never be
able to cross over, ever again.

653
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:55,652
And that'll be the end of it.

654
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:57,359
What about your daughter?

655
00:37:59,486 --> 00:38:01,534
Jesse's my battle to fight. Not yours.

656
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:24,723
Hey. How are you feeling?

657
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:28,808
Mmm, like I could
use some pizza right now.

658
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:34,063
But they're letting you out tomorrow,
so I can get you any kind you want.

659
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:35,731
- From anywhere you want.
- Deal.

660
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:39,735
You know, um,

661
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:45,157
growing up, we didn't have a lot of money
to go to the movies or buy toys.

662
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:50,670
Instead, she would just take me in the car
and we'd go for these long drives.

663
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:52,957
Just her and I and her music.

664
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:57,590
I remember being on the road with her
and just...

665
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:02,432
Watching the scenery flash by
and feeling so happy.

666
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:07,766
Now, when I race,

667
00:39:09,222 --> 00:39:11,441
feeling that rush of speed, it's like...

668
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:16,487
It's like I get to go back to those days.

669
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:24,029
I didn't want to stop, because if I do...

670
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:33,292
See? That wasn't so hard.

671
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,218
Actually, it was pretty hard.

672
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:46,719
This is a sample of Barry's cells
after whatever Harry did to them.

673
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:49,183
As you can see,
not only is it drained of the Speed Force

674
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:52,690
but it's also presenting itself
as chromosomal damage.

675
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:55,352
If Harry kept doing what he was doing,

676
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:58,488
he could have taken
your powers permanently.

677
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:01,153
Even Evil Wells couldn't figure out
how to do that one.

678
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:02,533
Well, look.
Somebody better send his ass back

679
00:40:02,692 --> 00:40:04,069
to where he came from
or I'm gonna shoot him.

680
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,657
- Amen.
- No.

681
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:07,830
What do you mean, "no"?

682
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,335
What would we have done,
ifwe were in his position?

683
00:40:12,869 --> 00:40:15,543
I mean, what would you do
if it was Iris, Joe?

684
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,208
Cisco, when Snart kidnapped you,

685
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:20,797
threatened to kill your brother
unless you helped, you did.

686
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:24,259
And none of us judged you for that.
We still don't.

687
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:26,052
Because when it comes to family,

688
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:29,059
when it comes to the people
that we all love,

689
00:40:30,178 --> 00:40:33,022
we're all vulnerable. None of us are
above making a wrong decision.

690
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:36,688
He could have done it,
he could've stolen my speed,

691
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,853
gotten away with it.
None of us would've even known.

692
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,192
But he didn't.

693
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:43,484
And now his daughter's gonna die
and we're okay with that?

694
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:45,075
I can't just give up on her.

695
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:47,862
I can't give up on a world.

696
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:51,283
This is a world full of people
who are facing death.

697
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:56,087
I don't know, I mean, I may not be
fast enough to beat Zoom yet, but...

698
00:40:57,538 --> 00:41:01,133
I'm not gonna just close the breaches
and forget about it.

699
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:05,304
We have to help Wells.

700
00:41:07,924 --> 00:41:09,392
Look, guys, I...

701
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:12,679
I was the one that trusted him first.

702
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:13,892
I own that.

703
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:17,184
I let him stay when literally all of you
told me not to.

704
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:19,853
So everything that's happened up
until this point, it's on me.

705
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:22,238
But this has to be a group decision.

706
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:29,616
Come on.

707
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:39,539
Well...

708
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,880
I guess this is good-bye.

709
00:41:44,544 --> 00:41:46,262
No. It's not.

710
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,132
I told you we're a team.

711
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:51,009
Now you're a part of it.

712
00:41:52,385 --> 00:41:55,184
We're gonna help you save Jesse.
We're not sending you through alone.

713
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:57,982
We're going to Earth-2.
