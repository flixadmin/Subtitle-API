Why would I go with you?

793
00:31:09,351 --> 00:31:11,219
Because, unfortunately,

794
00:31:11,253 --> 00:31:12,588
I need you,

795
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:16,693

my entire world needs you.

On your left, baby girl.

And bonus, he's actually
wearing a costume

836
00:32:44,679 --> 00:32:45,915
like he's not embarrassed to be

837
00:32:45,948 --> 00:32:47,316
in a superhero movie for once.

838
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,985
I don't understand.

839
00:32:49,018 --> 00:32:50,220
You said my universe is dying

840
00:32:50,254 --> 00:32:52,687
because this sack of nuts
got himself killed.

841

- Well, problem solved.
- My God.

842
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:59,796
You actually think you can
replace an Anchor Being

843
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:01,798
with this?

844
00:33:01,832 --> 00:33:04,399
I wouldn't have accepted
any other Wolverine, BT dubs.

845
00:33:04,432 --> 00:33:06,433
But you have outdone yourself

846
00:33:06,468 --> 00:33:08,671
and brought me
the worst Wolverine!

847
00:33:08,704 --> 00:33:09,939
What do you mean, the worst one?

848
00:33:09,972 --> 00:33:11,440
Mr. Wilson.

849
00:33:11,473 --> 00:33:15,443
This Wolverine let down
his entire world.

850
00:33:15,477 --> 00:33:17,847
He's the stuff of legend,
but not in a good way.

851
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,116
And what he did,

00:33:19,149 --> 00:33:20,515

beyond forgiveness.

Okay.

855
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:29,424
How do I... How do I make
this right? I'll do anything.

856
00:33:29,458 --> 00:33:32,427
I gave you
a chance at greatness.

857
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:35,063
Because my superiors
deemed you "special."

858
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:36,565
Clearly not special
in a good way.

859
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:37,633
Apparently you have some

860
00:33:37,667 --> 00:33:39,836
important future purpose
to serve.

861

With Thor. He holds me.

862
00:33:41,004 --> 00:33:42,804
But I did my duty.

863
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:44,874
I gave you the opportunity
to be somebody.

864
00:33:44,907 --> 00:33:46,876
And instead of
accepting my offering

865
00:33:46,909 --> 00:33:49,377
with humility and gratitude,
you broke my nose.

[sighs] It looks great.

867
00:33:50,478 --> 00:33:52,414
And you decimated
dozens of my men

868
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:54,050
with the exhumed corpse
of a hero.

869
00:33:54,083 --> 00:33:56,418
Dishonoring not only
his remains but his memory.

870
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:57,786
What are you, the Internet?

871
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:00,056

The humane thing to do

is to make it quick.

876
00:34:07,661 --> 00:34:09,564
Is the thought
of vaporizing my universe

877

making you peckish?

that I've ever cared about

I wanna talk to your boss.

I want you to get him
on the phone

01:10:28,702 --> 01:10:30,637
what, two days ago?

1738
01:10:30,670 --> 01:10:32,973
[Deadpool] Ugh. That's so sad.

1739
01:10:33,006 --> 01:10:35,742
Wherever this Johnny fella is,
I'm sure he's thriving.

1740
01:10:35,776 --> 01:10:36,911
[Wolverine chuckles]

1741
01:10:36,944 --> 01:10:39,180
Look, there's...
there's strength in numbers.

1742
01:10:39,213 --> 01:10:40,314
All right? Us...

1743
01:10:40,348 --> 01:10:41,680
plus, you guys.
We can put Cassandra

1744
01:10:41,714 --> 01:10:43,985
over our knee and force her
to let us out of The Void.

1745
01:10:44,018 --> 01:10:45,685
I know what it means
to feel self-doubt.

1746
01:10:45,719 --> 01:10:47,255
- I don't feel that at all.
- I'm good.

1747
01:10:47,288 --> 01:10:49,523
[Deadpool] Gnawing at your gut
like a coked-up tapeworm.

1748
01:10:49,555 --> 01:10:51,092
It's like you're holding up
a mirror to my soul.

1749
01:10:51,125 --> 01:10:52,460
[Deadpool] You guys
may not have been able

1750
01:10:52,493 --> 01:10:54,227
to save your universes.

1751
01:10:54,261 --> 01:10:56,432
But you can avenge them.

1752
01:10:56,464 --> 01:10:57,764
It's what Johnny
would have wanted.

1753
01:10:57,798 --> 01:11:00,834
Wait. You knew Johnny?

1754
01:11:01,635 --> 01:11:02,869
[chuckles] Oh, yeah.

1755
01:11:02,903 --> 01:11:04,871
Dickhead here talked him
into a team-up,

1756
01:11:04,906 --> 01:11:07,508
and Johnny came down with
a little case of the deads.

1757
01:11:07,542 --> 01:11:08,843
[Deadpool] No, no, no.
We don't know that.

1758
01:11:08,876 --> 01:11:11,079
It was just a flesh wound.
He may have survived.

1759
01:11:11,112 --> 01:11:13,881
If he survived that,
he is prayin' for death.

1760
01:11:13,915 --> 01:11:15,550
[Deadpool] Thank you,
Doctor Wolverine!

1761
01:11:15,582 --> 01:11:17,751
- Spill it!
- What'd you do to Johnny, huh?

1762
01:11:17,784 --> 01:11:18,953
Talk or I'm gonna start dealin'.

1763
01:11:18,986 --> 01:11:20,654
[Deadpool] Okay. Okay.
Hey, hey, hey.

1764
01:11:21,121 --> 01:11:21,955
Look.

1765
01:11:21,988 --> 01:11:24,424
He ran his fat-ass mouth
about Cassandra.

1766
01:11:24,458 --> 01:11:26,226
Then she zip-zapped his skin,

1767
01:11:26,259 --> 01:11:28,396
leaving his organs to splash
crudely onto the ground

1768
01:11:28,429 --> 01:11:31,365
while the soil greedily drank
his blood. It was horrible.

1769
01:11:31,399 --> 01:11:33,166
He was like a brother to me.

1770
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:36,336
Look, he died before he could
make a difference. But...

1771
01:11:36,369 --> 01:11:37,405
- [laughs]
- Look, maybe you couldn't

1772
01:11:37,438 --> 01:11:38,873
save your worlds, but...

1773
01:11:38,906 --> 01:11:41,641
but Jesus Christ,
you can save mine!

1774
01:11:41,675 --> 01:11:44,144
I don't give a shit
about your world, but

1775
01:11:44,177 --> 01:11:47,116
if these two made it out of
there alive, maybe together,

1776
01:11:47,148 --> 01:11:49,050
we can get back in
and take her down.

1777
01:11:49,083 --> 01:11:52,053
Where I come from,
we call that suicide, <i>Chere.</i>

1778
01:11:52,086 --> 01:11:54,055
[Deadpool] If we can block
her psychic powers,

1779
01:11:54,088 --> 01:11:55,956
we can get a leg up.
I know it.

1780
01:11:55,989 --> 01:11:58,025
Now, I know Magneto's dead.

1781
01:11:58,059 --> 01:12:00,660
But I'd venture to guess
that his helmet is lying

1782
01:12:00,694 --> 01:12:02,729
- around here somewhere...
- Cassandra melted the helmet.

1783
01:12:02,762 --> 01:12:03,930
- [Deadpool] Fuck!
- After she killed him.

1784
01:12:03,964 --> 01:12:05,932
- [Deadpool] Fuck!
- She don't play.

1785
01:12:05,966 --> 01:12:07,400
She knows that helmet
was the only way

1786
01:12:07,434 --> 01:12:09,069
to protect anyone
from her powers.

1787
01:12:09,102 --> 01:12:10,971
The only other helmet that
strong is Juggernaut's,

1788
01:12:11,004 --> 01:12:12,240
but he works for Cassandra.

1789
01:12:12,273 --> 01:12:13,772
[Deadpool] Juggernaut's
helmet. That's it.

1790
01:12:13,806 --> 01:12:15,475
Yeah, and we done be knowing
that lid ain't comin' off

1791
01:12:15,509 --> 01:12:16,910
without that dome
gonna come off wit'it.

1792
01:12:16,943 --> 01:12:18,212
[Deadpool] I'm so sorry,
beautiful.

1793
01:12:18,246 --> 01:12:19,113
I want this to be gentle.

1794
01:12:19,147 --> 01:12:21,414
Who is your dialect coach?
The Minions?

1795
01:12:21,448 --> 01:12:24,717
I feel like we are missing
critical exposition here.

1796
01:12:25,919 --> 01:12:28,890
I'm sick of this shit.
I'm sick of hiding.

1797
01:12:29,924 --> 01:12:31,958
Let's face it,
our worlds forgot about us.

1798
01:12:31,992 --> 01:12:33,792
Or never learned about us.

1799
01:12:33,827 --> 01:12:35,262
The heroes we were.

1800
01:12:35,295 --> 01:12:36,596
Lives we saved.

1801
01:12:36,630 --> 01:12:37,998
Or wanted to save.

1802
01:12:38,031 --> 01:12:40,067
Maybe these two are our chance.

1803
01:12:40,101 --> 01:12:41,401
[gurgling]

1804
01:12:41,434 --> 01:12:43,170
To be remembered.

1805
01:12:43,203 --> 01:12:44,271
The way we deserve.

1806
01:12:45,405 --> 01:12:46,473
[Deadpool] Yes.

1807
01:12:46,506 --> 01:12:48,307
An ending.

1808
01:12:48,340 --> 01:12:49,544
- Legacy.
- [Deadpool] Yes!

1809
01:12:49,577 --> 01:12:51,044
Yes! Let this man cook.

1810
01:12:51,077 --> 01:12:52,580
This is what I'm talking about.

1811
01:12:52,613 --> 01:12:54,581
Big slow-motion fights,
sad music.

1812
01:12:54,614 --> 01:12:55,815
Everybody working together.

1813
01:12:55,849 --> 01:12:57,683
Who knows if you live or die?
That sorta thing.

1814
01:12:57,716 --> 01:12:59,853
- Who's ready?
- I was born ready.

1815
01:12:59,886 --> 01:13:01,155
[Deadpool] Yes!
Gambit?

1816
01:13:01,189 --> 01:13:02,123
I ain't know my daddy,

1817
01:13:02,156 --> 01:13:04,124
but I'm sure I shot out
of his dick ready.

1818
01:13:04,157 --> 01:13:06,059
[Deadpool] Jesus Christ,
that is graphic.

1819
01:13:06,092 --> 01:13:08,028
Yeah. He was layin' them
buttery nuts all up in my mama

1820
01:13:08,061 --> 01:13:10,064
and I shot out there
and I said, "What's up, Doc?"

1821
01:13:10,097 --> 01:13:12,533
[Deadpool laughs]
Johnny must have loved you.

1822
01:13:12,567 --> 01:13:14,834
X-23, what's it gonna be?

1823
01:13:14,868 --> 01:13:16,102
The name's Laura.

1824
01:13:16,136 --> 01:13:18,938
- Let's fucking go.
- [Deadpool] Let's fucking go!

1825
01:13:18,971 --> 01:13:20,208
It's on like chicken and corn.

1826
01:13:20,241 --> 01:13:21,740
- [Deadpool] Yeah!
- We're doing this.

1827
01:13:21,774 --> 01:13:22,842
You're all fuckin' dead.

1828
01:13:22,876 --> 01:13:25,212
[Deadpool] My God!
Read the room.

1829

[exhales]

1831
01:13:36,056 --> 01:13:39,191
Hey, hey. I'm not lookin'
for company. Get out of here.

1832
01:13:41,362 --> 01:13:42,862
You remind me of him.

1833
01:13:42,896 --> 01:13:44,730
Angry. Drunk. Mean...

1834
01:13:44,763 --> 01:13:46,932
- Sounds like a great guy...
- Wasn't finished.

1835
01:13:48,733 --> 01:13:50,338
Showed up when
it mattered the most.

1836
01:13:52,572 --> 01:13:54,241
Couldn't help it.

[sighs]

1838

You might not know it, but...

1839
01:13:59,813 --> 01:14:01,248
you're a good man, Logan.

1840
01:14:01,281 --> 01:14:02,282
[chuckles]

1841
01:14:03,284 --> 01:14:04,951
You might not know it,
but apparently,

1842
01:14:04,985 --> 01:14:06,386
I'm the worst Logan.

1843
01:14:08,221 --> 01:14:10,124
I got to have a life
because of you.

1844
01:14:13,027 --> 01:14:14,760
I got to grow up because of you.

1845
01:14:16,762 --> 01:14:18,330
A lot of kids did.

1846
01:14:18,364 --> 01:14:20,500
A lot of kids didn't grow up
because of me.

1847
01:14:22,702 --> 01:14:24,304
Trust me, kid, I'm no hero.

1848
01:14:25,639 --> 01:14:27,707
That suit says different.

1849
01:14:27,741 --> 01:14:29,875
- Yeah. Do you like it?
- Mm.

1850
01:14:31,745 --> 01:14:33,446
Scott used to beg me to wear it.

1851
01:14:35,715 --> 01:14:38,318
So did Jean, Storm, Beast.

1852
01:14:40,386 --> 01:14:42,422
All of them.

1853
01:14:42,455 --> 01:14:46,192
They wanted me to be part
of the team, but I wouldn't.

1854
01:14:46,226 --> 01:14:49,529
Told 'em they all look
fucking ridiculous. I mean...

1855
01:14:51,365 --> 01:14:54,134
I couldn't have 'em thinkin'
I wanted to be there.

1856
01:14:59,804 --> 01:15:01,842
And then one day,
while I was off on my own,

1857
01:15:01,876 --> 01:15:03,143
the humans came...

1858
01:15:03,711 --> 01:15:05,145
and went mutant hunting.

1859
01:15:06,412 --> 01:15:07,580
I can guess the rest.

1860
01:15:07,614 --> 01:15:08,815
No, no, let me...

1861
01:15:10,049 --> 01:15:11,250
Let me say it. I...

1862
01:15:13,853 --> 01:15:15,055
I need to say it.

1863
01:15:17,524 --> 01:15:20,193
By the time I stumbled home
shitfaced from the bar,

1864
01:15:20,226 --> 01:15:21,527
it was too late.

1865
01:15:25,332 --> 01:15:27,033
They were dead. Every...

[♪ mournful music playing]

This suit's all I got to
remind me of who they were.

1868
01:15:38,278 --> 01:15:39,312
And what I did.

1869

[sniffles]

1870
01:15:52,291 --> 01:15:54,094
We're headed to Cassandra's
at sunup.

1871
01:15:54,894 --> 01:15:56,930
Have fun. Not my fight.

1872
01:16:00,165 --> 01:16:01,900
We won't pull this off
without you.

Hey. Whoever you think I am,
you got the wrong guy.

You were always the wrong guy.

Alioth didn't get them.
[sniffs]

1879

Cassandra wanted to
play with them herself first.

- Did they find the others?
- No.

Good. All right. Phew.

- Oh, very cute.

Well done, Pyro.

- Relax.

If they come after Nova,
she'll handle it.

1887

Cassandra is
a lunatic wild card.

Why do you think we put her
there in the first place?

Thank God she's never chosen
to leave The Void.
