1
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,959
This afternoon at 5:00.

2
00:00:41,084 --> 00:00:44,087
Il Duce will speak to the nation!

3
00:00:44,212 --> 00:00:46,089
You are ordered
to turn your radios on!

4
00:00:46,297 --> 00:00:52,220
All of you who have radio sets
and radio gramophones...

5
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,557
are ordered to turn them on.

6
00:00:55,682 --> 00:00:59,477
Mussolini will speak to

7
00:00:59,602 --> 00:01:02,230
all Italians!

8
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,026
You are authorized by order
of the Fascist government...

9
00:01:07,068 --> 00:01:11,322
to interrupt your work. This afternoon at
5.00... Il Duce will speak to the nation.

10
00:01:11,698 --> 00:01:16,703
<i>I was twelve and a half
when I saw her for the first time.</i>

11
00:01:16,911 --> 00:01:19,289
<i>And my mind plays tricks on me,
I remember it well.</i>

12
00:01:19,956 --> 00:01:23,543
<i>That day, Mussolini declared war
on France and Great Britain...</i>

13
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:27,589
<i>and I got my first bicycle.</i>

14
00:01:27,714 --> 00:01:31,175
The frame is British, the gears are German,

15
00:01:31,217 --> 00:01:34,053
the pedals are French,

16
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:38,224
and the brakes are from...
I forget.

17
00:01:38,349 --> 00:01:41,686
But the chain is Sicilian...
always keep it greasy.

18
00:01:41,811 --> 00:01:43,187
Are you sure it's safe?

19
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:45,064
I have new bikes too.

20
00:01:45,607 --> 00:01:49,611
Mimi, we're at war.
Who can afford a new bicycle?

21
00:01:51,613 --> 00:01:53,072
Fightingmen,

22
00:01:54,866 --> 00:01:58,119
on land, on sea and in the air,

23
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:02,248
Black shirts of the revolution,

24
00:02:02,707 --> 00:02:04,626
men and women of Italy...

25
00:02:04,834 --> 00:02:08,004
and the Kingdom of Albania, hear this:

26
00:02:35,406 --> 00:02:36,699
The hour...

27
00:02:38,785 --> 00:02:40,036
of decisions from which

28
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:44,415
there is no return.

29
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:48,211
Pino, think this ant knows he's dead meat?

30
00:02:48,336 --> 00:02:49,337
Who knows?

31
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:52,340
If he's like you, he doesn't know shit.

32
00:02:52,715 --> 00:02:55,468
The declaration of war...

33
00:02:55,968 --> 00:03:00,348
has already been delivered
to the ambassadors.

34
00:03:17,073 --> 00:03:22,495
I'm free from misery.
Mary's son is my Lord.

35
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:26,833
Hey, guys!

36
00:03:31,254 --> 00:03:32,964
Lucky bastard.

37
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:37,093
- He got a new bicycle!
- Man, she's beautiful!

38
00:03:38,136 --> 00:03:40,847
Custom-made, just like the racers.

39
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:44,767
- Now you're a man, like us.
- So I can join the gang?

40
00:03:44,851 --> 00:03:47,019
- "Don Agostino"?
- Okay by me.

41
00:03:47,145 --> 00:03:49,856
- "Don Nicola"?
- I'd let him in.

42
00:03:50,148 --> 00:03:52,108
- "Don Tonino"?
- Sure.

43
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:53,776
And you, "Don Sasa"?

44
00:03:53,818 --> 00:03:57,280
I don't want some kid
poking into our business.

45
00:03:57,363 --> 00:04:00,283
- Why? What are you doing?
- Can you keep your mouth shut?

46
00:04:06,497 --> 00:04:07,498
She's coming!

47
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:13,171
What's going on?

48
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:18,259
If you wanna be one of us,
just shut up and watch.

49
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:10,895
Who is she?

50
00:05:10,895 --> 00:05:13,189
The daughter of the deaf
guy, our new Latin teacher.

51
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:16,442
- What's her name?
- What a wonderful ass!

52
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,340
What I wouldn't give for an hour with her!

53
00:06:21,591 --> 00:06:25,511
- Too bad she's married.
- If she weren't...

54
00:06:26,137 --> 00:06:27,138
What's her name?

55
00:06:27,263 --> 00:06:31,267
Malèna, the most beautiful ass
in Castelcuto.

56
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:40,234
The sun is bigger than the moon.

57
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:44,280
"<i>Sole magnum est quam lunam.</i>"

58
00:06:44,363 --> 00:06:47,909
Or "<i>Sol maior est Luna.</i>"

59
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:50,995
Can I screw your daughter,
you deaf old fart?

60
00:06:51,162 --> 00:06:52,371
Yes, but hurry.

61
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:57,418
I love honesty more than wealth.

62
00:06:58,294 --> 00:07:03,007
"<i>Magis diligo onestatem quam divitias.</i>"

63
00:07:03,174 --> 00:07:07,637
Or "<i>Magis diligo onestatem divitiis.</i>"

64
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:42,296
- Seven thumbs long!
- Seven and a half thumbs!

65
00:07:42,338 --> 00:07:44,423
- Mine's a bazooka!
- I got eight!

66
00:07:44,674 --> 00:07:48,552
Eight is nothing!
That's just tickling a woman.

67
00:07:48,594 --> 00:07:52,223
One, two... three and two is five,
two is seven and two is nine.

68
00:07:52,348 --> 00:07:53,724
Torpedo!

69
00:07:53,933 --> 00:07:56,978
My submarine will rip Malèna in half!

70
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,190
Once I skipped school
and went by Malèna's house.

71
00:08:01,357 --> 00:08:05,361
She was at the window,
and she called out to me.

72
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:09,573
I thought she wanted me
to get her some cigarettes.

73
00:08:10,074 --> 00:08:12,576
I went up for the money,
and her robe fell open.

74
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:17,123
And there she was...
naked as the day she was born.

75
00:08:17,248 --> 00:08:19,125
Holy shit! She did it
on purpose to excite me.

76
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:24,046
I was an idiot.
I should have jumped at the chance.

77
00:08:24,088 --> 00:08:27,508
If it happens again,
I'll bang her brains out.

78
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:31,345
She'd quit smoking first.
She knows you've got no balls.

79
00:08:31,387 --> 00:08:35,558
You little runt, you've been
here for two hours...

80
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:37,685
and you still haven't measured yourself.

81
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:39,937
Measure it!

82
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:42,898
One, two,

83
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:46,193
three, four, five...

84
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:47,695
Only six!

85
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,574
You know what they say
about a kid in short pants?

86
00:08:51,699 --> 00:08:53,492
Short pants: short dick!

87
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,412
Fuck off. My thumbs are
twice as big as yours!

88
00:08:56,454 --> 00:08:57,705
Bullshit!

89
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:04,336
- Who's got the biggest dick now, runt?
- You do!

90
00:09:04,587 --> 00:09:06,547
No, I am II Duce!
Nobody's bigger than me!

91
00:09:13,304 --> 00:09:15,431
- Ooh. Renato's skipping school.
- Shh!

92
00:10:11,112 --> 00:10:14,740
You, come here!
I need some cigarettes.

93
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:26,877
What cigarettes do you want?

94
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:29,922
Macedonia Extra.

95
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:52,570
I remember this suit very well.
It's your father's.

96
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:56,657
I sewed it 20 years ago,
and it still looks brand-new.

97
00:10:56,824 --> 00:11:00,703
He only wore it to his wedding.
He wants to keep it for his funeral.

98
00:11:00,828 --> 00:11:05,207
If he's buried in this suit,
he'll go straight to heaven!

99
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:06,667
My father's still young.

100
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:10,087
And you're too young
for long pants.

101
00:11:10,212 --> 00:11:12,339
I didn't ask for your opinion, sir.

102
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:14,842
- Does he know about this?
- Of course he does!

103
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:18,554
You little scoundrel,
what the hell is this?

104
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:23,601
Come here, mister.
So you want to skip school?

105
00:11:23,601 --> 00:11:26,103
Fine. Who didn't at your age?

106
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:29,106
- Leave him alone!
- I know what I'm doing.

107
00:11:31,609 --> 00:11:35,237
And you let your friends beat you up.

108
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:39,825
Even though when I was your age,
I'd beat my friends up!

109
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:44,455
But stealing trousers from your father...

110
00:11:44,622 --> 00:11:48,834
and getting them altered for yourself
is just plain wrong.

111
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,252
But, Papa, you don't understand!

112
00:11:50,753 --> 00:11:53,464
Understand?
Who said you could speak?

113
00:11:53,756 --> 00:11:55,966
I'm ashamed to wear short pants!

114
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:58,135
What about knickers?
They're almost long pants!

115
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,095
Enough!
He's still a child!

116
00:12:00,221 --> 00:12:04,892
I'll tell our party secretary you won't
let me go to the Fascist exercises!

117
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:12,691
Let's make a deal.

118
00:12:13,776 --> 00:12:18,113
The day someone cracks the skull
of "Our Great Leader,"

119
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:22,159
then you'll get long pants.

120
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:23,535
Swear it.

121
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:03,946
A beautiful young woman
all alone here. It's a crime.

122
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:08,075
- Who's he talking about?
- Malèna Scordia, Nino's sexy new wife.

123
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:11,161
She must have somebody
on the side... it's inevitable!

124
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:13,288
- Number fifteen!
- Me.

125
00:15:13,789 --> 00:15:16,959
Right. Nino brings her from
her village with her ailing father.

126
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:21,088
And then a month later...
boom... Nino's called to the war.

127
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:23,841
Who here wants to bet
she's sleeping all alone?

128
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:25,801
Not me!

129
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:31,056
Why don't you let me
sit with the others?

130
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:35,185
You're too young to sit
in the adult chair.

131

But, son, if you don't know
the title, how can I help you?

144
00:18:54,843 --> 00:18:57,012
It's that pretty, romantic one...

145
00:19:00,766 --> 00:19:03,852
Ma L'Amore No.
Why didn't you say so?

146
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:09,107
Ten lire.
Pay at the cashier's.

147
00:19:09,232 --> 00:19:10,609
- Don't you test it?
- What for?

148
00:19:10,734 --> 00:19:13,779
- It might be defective.
- It's brand-new!

149
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,634
Miss Malèna, this heart of mine,
on fire, has written so many letters,

150
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:45,055
and if I didn't have the courage
to send them to you,

151
00:21:45,263 --> 00:21:47,933
it was only because
I didn't want to do you harm.

152
00:21:48,683 --> 00:21:52,187
So forgive me if I dare
to send you this one.

153
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:55,273
I want you to know that
this town has many gossips...

154
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,153
who say bad things about you...
that you have a secret lover.

155
00:22:00,195 --> 00:22:03,657
I know it's not true.
You don't have anyone.

156
00:22:03,698 --> 00:22:07,702
After your husband,
the only man in your life is me.

157
00:22:44,447 --> 00:22:47,617
I have to go.
I'll see you at school tomorrow.

158
00:22:48,618 --> 00:22:51,621
So long!

159
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:17,457
Don't get lost!

160
00:24:17,582 --> 00:24:20,210
Mr. Lawyer!
Your newspaper's upside down!

161
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:21,670
Mind your own fucking business!

162
00:24:31,972 --> 00:24:36,309
Good morning, Signora Malèna.
Are you well? How is your father?

163
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:12,262
The show's over!
She's gone now!

164
00:26:07,942 --> 00:26:09,277
I forgot the key.

165
00:26:25,543 --> 00:26:28,463
So it's true what people say!

166
00:26:28,588 --> 00:26:30,715
What's the matter with you?
You look so strange.

167
00:26:30,924 --> 00:26:32,300
You've poisoned me with your lies.

168
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:35,345
What lies?
I've never spoken to you.

169
00:26:35,845 --> 00:26:40,975
I knew it from the start...
you're a loose woman.

170
00:26:41,184 --> 00:26:44,187
But I've never done anything wrong.

171
00:26:44,312 --> 00:26:47,315
Liar! I've been following
you on my bicycle!

172
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,692
- I know where you went. I know everything!
- No!

173
00:26:50,443 --> 00:26:52,987
- The lawyer, the dentist!
- No, Renato, I love only you!

174
00:26:53,238 --> 00:26:54,697
Liar!

175
00:26:59,494 --> 00:27:01,329
- Amoroso.
- Here!

176
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:02,497
- Cali.
- Here!

177
00:27:03,123 --> 00:27:04,249
- Costanza.
- Here!

178
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:08,253
Professor, can I put my dick
between Malèna's tits?

179
00:27:08,378 --> 00:27:10,713
Can I put mine in her mouth?

180
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,841
Can I put mine
between her legs?

181
00:27:13,758 --> 00:27:15,593
Okay, but one at a time!

182
00:27:24,602 --> 00:27:26,521
Do you spit instead of oiling it?

183
00:27:26,604 --> 00:27:31,151
No. I use cooking oil.

184
00:27:31,276 --> 00:27:32,694
If you come, I will give it to you.

185
00:27:32,735 --> 00:27:35,905
Used machine needs oil, fool.
Or grease, which is better.

186
00:27:35,989 --> 00:27:38,783
Do you know grease?
Keeps the chain slippery!

187
00:27:49,294 --> 00:27:52,255
Why didn't she marry
someone from her own village?

188
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,923
I'm sure no one wanted her.

189
00:28:00,013 --> 00:28:01,806
They say she's a seamstress.

190
00:28:01,931 --> 00:28:04,017
But she's so vulgar.

191
00:28:13,276 --> 00:28:15,153
My son says she looks fake.

192
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:17,697
My husband says he wouldn't touch
her with a ten-foot pole.

193
00:28:17,697 --> 00:28:21,910
The Baron Bonta's mistress
IS much nicer.

194
00:28:22,202 --> 00:28:24,287
At least Gina does everything
in the open.

195
00:28:24,329 --> 00:28:28,082
The baron screws her once a week
and then goes back to Palermo.

196
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:32,086
Malèna acts so superior.
Like we don't know what she's up to.

197
00:28:32,212 --> 00:28:34,172
Wait and see.
She'll get hers.

198
00:29:24,097 --> 00:29:27,392
The headquarters of
the armed forces communicates...

199
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,770
Our brave and invincible Fightingmen
have delivered a powerful blow...

200
00:29:30,853 --> 00:29:34,274
to the faceless war machine
unleashed by the Allies.

201
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:38,653
In order to ensure the continued
strength and vitality...

202
00:29:38,778 --> 00:29:43,866
of our forces at the front,

203
00:29:44,033 --> 00:29:49,539
all payment of civic pensions...
will again be postponed...

204
00:29:56,796 --> 00:29:58,548
- It's ready.
- Thank you.

205
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,958
You will go blind!

206
00:31:24,217 --> 00:31:25,259
Malèna.

207
00:31:25,468 --> 00:31:27,595
Right rank!
Eyes front!

208
00:31:27,637 --> 00:31:30,848
Arms put, arms high,
In quick succession!

209
00:31:31,015 --> 00:31:34,268
One, two! One, two!

210
00:31:34,477 --> 00:31:38,981
Have you heard?
Malèna's husband was killed.

211
00:31:39,148 --> 00:31:41,109
Malèna is available!

212
00:32:11,013 --> 00:32:13,391
Comrades of Castelcuto,

213
00:32:13,558 --> 00:32:16,060
we are gathered here today...

214
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:20,440
to share in the tragic
but honorable mourning...

215
00:32:20,565 --> 00:32:22,900
which has struck our town.

216
00:32:23,276 --> 00:32:26,487
To express our deepest condolences...

217
00:32:26,529 --> 00:32:29,282
for the loss of Lt. Nino Scordia...

218
00:32:29,574 --> 00:32:34,203
heroically killed in action...
in Northern Africa...

219
00:32:35,455 --> 00:32:37,582
and to his bride Maddalena,

220
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:42,170
who, stricken with grief,
unfortunately isn't here with us.

221
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:46,799
- She's already out looking!
- She'll need a warm bed now!

222
00:32:47,091 --> 00:32:51,220
But she is with us in spirit,
because Sicilian women...

223
00:32:51,596 --> 00:32:54,348
with their hardships,
with their sacrifices,

224
00:32:54,474 --> 00:32:56,726
march shoulder to shoulder
with Fightingmen!

225
00:33:02,356 --> 00:33:04,400
The martyrdom of our
fellow citizen in defense

226
00:33:04,442 --> 00:33:06,444
of his country was
not a useless sacrifice.

227
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:11,782
Lt. Cadet is so handsome.

228
00:33:11,908 --> 00:33:13,743
A lucky girl will catch him!

229
00:33:13,951 --> 00:33:17,246
That will carry us to the
final victory of the Fascist Empire!

230
00:33:26,756 --> 00:33:28,508
For Victory!

231
00:33:28,633 --> 00:33:29,634
Long live Il Duce!

232
00:34:55,344 --> 00:34:58,014
From now on I'll be at your side.

233
00:34:58,139 --> 00:35:00,850
Forever. I promise.

234
00:35:00,891 --> 00:35:03,227
Just give me time to grow up.

235
00:35:58,407 --> 00:36:00,034
Now she'll take a lover for sure.

236
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:03,120
Once in the sack,
there's no looking back!

237
00:36:03,287 --> 00:36:06,123
She knows that. She's 27 years old.

238
00:36:06,332 --> 00:36:08,334
She knows her way
around the block!

239
00:36:08,417 --> 00:36:11,170
Cusimano, the dentist,
has gone crazy for her.

240
00:36:11,295 --> 00:36:13,339
One day he was distracted by her
ass as she walked by...

241
00:36:13,589 --> 00:36:17,468
and pulled a healthy tooth
instead of the rotten one!

242
00:36:18,427 --> 00:36:21,722
Dentist or not, why haven't
we seen her lately?

243
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:24,975
Guess she's too busy!

244
00:36:27,728 --> 00:36:31,023
They say she's fooling
around with a shopkeeper in Catania...

245
00:36:31,065 --> 00:36:32,608
with subversive tendencies.

246
00:36:32,692 --> 00:36:35,986
Some say Cusimano, the dentist.

247
00:36:36,112 --> 00:36:40,491
- A family man. It's disgraceful!
- When you're a born whore...

248
00:36:40,616 --> 00:36:45,454
I hear the priest has received
anonymous letters...

249
00:36:45,621 --> 00:36:47,998
saying her lover
is this man, that man.

250
00:36:48,207 --> 00:36:49,917
The voice of the people
is the voice of God!

251
00:37:23,617 --> 00:37:26,412
I can't talk to anyone about
my personal problems.

252
00:37:26,412 --> 00:37:28,372
They're too intimate.

253
00:37:28,414 --> 00:37:31,625
But you seem nice.
I'd like to confide in you.

254
00:37:31,751 --> 00:37:33,544
Every day,
I'll light a candle for you.

255
00:37:39,675 --> 00:37:45,264
I'll even come to Mass on Sunday.

256
00:37:45,306 --> 00:37:49,560
But you must protect
Malèna Scordia from the town.

257
00:37:49,685 --> 00:37:53,314
Yes, the widow... at least for
a few years. Then I'll take over.

258
00:38:17,338 --> 00:38:19,840
Don't you like the movie?

259
00:38:45,491 --> 00:38:49,620
I am always at your service.

260
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,872
- Renewed condolences, Malèna.
- Condolences.

261
00:39:01,257 --> 00:39:03,509
What a piece of ass!

262
00:39:05,511 --> 00:39:06,595
Son of a bitch!

263
00:39:09,765 --> 00:39:11,016
You little runt!
Come back here!

264
00:39:29,994 --> 00:39:33,914
- Can't you sing in Italian?
- Can't you speak German?

265
00:41:53,887 --> 00:41:56,432
I cannot live without my life.

266
00:41:56,557 --> 00:41:59,309
I cannot die without my soul.

267
00:42:04,064 --> 00:42:06,066
Renato, it's late.

268
00:42:06,275 --> 00:42:08,444
Renato, get up.

269
00:42:16,827 --> 00:42:18,287
Monster!

270
00:42:18,454 --> 00:42:20,581
You're a fetishist,

271
00:42:20,706 --> 00:42:22,958
a sadomasochist,
or even worse, a pervert!

272
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:27,963
- What is that?
- It's just a French hat, Ma!

273
00:42:30,966 --> 00:42:32,051
Shame on you!

274
00:42:32,176 --> 00:42:36,430
Shame on you!
Can I keep this?

275
00:42:38,557 --> 00:42:42,853
What are you looking at?
Get out of here!

276
00:42:42,978 --> 00:42:44,605
Come here, you little pig!

277
00:42:46,106 --> 00:42:47,983
- Goddamn pervert!
- What did I do?

278
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:54,490
You're not permitted to sit
at the table with us, understand?

279
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:57,201
- Answer me!
- Okay!

280
00:43:00,579 --> 00:43:04,333
You no longer have the right
to speak to your sisters, understand?

281
00:43:04,458 --> 00:43:08,003
Lock me up!
I'll show you!

282
00:43:09,004 --> 00:43:12,216
You're not to leave this room
until further notice!

283
00:43:12,966 --> 00:43:17,012
Son, at least have some soup.
It will do you good.

284
00:43:17,387 --> 00:43:20,224
Pietro, he hasn't eaten
for three days.

285
00:43:20,265 --> 00:43:24,103
In the Soviet Union,
they never eat.

286
00:43:25,145 --> 00:43:26,355
Still... What is this shit?

287
00:43:26,396 --> 00:43:30,526
The Fascists gave it to us.
At least it looks like coffee.

288
00:43:30,776 --> 00:43:32,528
Sure, and I look
like Vittorio De Sica.

289
00:43:32,653 --> 00:43:35,531
Everything they give us is terrible!

290
00:43:35,531 --> 00:43:38,659
Look at these pockets.
They're always ripping open!

291
00:43:38,909 --> 00:43:41,286
This cheap thread
doesn't hold the stitches!

292
00:43:41,411 --> 00:43:43,288
The thread isn't the problem!

293
00:43:43,413 --> 00:43:46,625
While our son recites poetry,
his hands go to work in his pockets!

294
00:43:46,667 --> 00:43:49,545
What does that mean?

295
00:43:50,295 --> 00:43:52,297
Do you get it now'?

296
00:43:52,756 --> 00:43:55,425
Just as well! Don't fix them.
Sew the pockets closed!

297
00:43:55,551 --> 00:43:58,470
But he'll have no pockets.

298
00:43:58,512 --> 00:44:01,140
He'll work it out.
It will be good for his health!

299
00:44:02,766 --> 00:44:05,519
Lights out!

300
00:44:05,936 --> 00:44:11,150
"That the weary spirit may
never repose in more restful harbor--"

301
00:44:11,316 --> 00:44:14,444
- Has he gone crazy?
- I think he's gone blind.

302
00:44:20,534 --> 00:44:22,953
While upon women's work
you sat intent,

303
00:44:23,579 --> 00:44:26,331
content with the vague future
you held in mind...

304
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:30,544
was the scented May, and thus
you used to spend your days.

305
00:44:31,587 --> 00:44:34,047
This child needs air.

306
00:44:34,089 --> 00:44:36,300
- Air?
- Air.

307
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:06,830
Good morning, Professor.

308
00:45:19,885 --> 00:45:22,012
This letter is for you.

309
00:45:23,263 --> 00:45:25,515
It says "urgent."

310
00:45:35,859 --> 00:45:39,863
You're dishonored. Your daughter
Malèna is sleeping with the whole town.

311
00:45:59,174 --> 00:46:01,176
It was an anonymous letter,
but I read it!

312
00:46:01,301 --> 00:46:04,012
It says Malèna is a whore
with everyone in town!

313
00:46:04,179 --> 00:46:06,431
So there's hope for us too!

314
00:46:08,433 --> 00:46:10,060
Take it back!

315
00:46:10,185 --> 00:46:13,730
I'll bust your ass,
Mr. Short Pants!

316
00:46:55,689 --> 00:46:57,232
Tonight was wonderful.

317
00:46:58,734 --> 00:47:02,738
- For me too.
- I know it's been only ten months since.

318
00:47:02,863 --> 00:47:06,700
- But maybe I can see you again.
- All right. You win.

319
00:47:06,783 --> 00:47:10,120
- Tomorrow.
- Okay, as long as I'm not on duty.

320
00:47:10,245 --> 00:47:11,913
- Thanks for the flowers.
- You're welcome.

321
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:26,511
Take care of yourself.

322
00:47:33,894 --> 00:47:37,230
So see you tomorrow?

323
00:47:37,272 --> 00:47:38,398
Yes.

324
00:47:40,025 --> 00:47:42,152
- Until then.
- Good night, Leone.

325
00:47:44,529 --> 00:47:46,531
What time?

326
00:47:48,784 --> 00:47:51,411
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening, my ass!

327
00:47:51,536 --> 00:47:55,791
How dare you
pester my fiancee!

328
00:47:55,916 --> 00:47:59,044
There must be a misunderstanding.
I was invited.

329
00:47:59,169 --> 00:48:01,254
You're a liar and a bastard!

330
00:48:01,922 --> 00:48:04,800
Because I'm in uniform,
I can not retaliate, sir.

331
00:48:04,925 --> 00:48:08,053
- But you will answer to me.
- Anytime.

332
00:48:09,429 --> 00:48:14,267
- Coward, Scoundrel!
- Get up.

333
00:48:14,393 --> 00:48:16,436
Come here!
I'll tear you apart, you coward!

334
00:48:16,561 --> 00:48:19,689
I'll break you in two!

335
00:48:20,941 --> 00:48:24,027
Let me go! Or I'll have
to get tough with you!

336
00:48:26,446 --> 00:48:30,450
- Here's the adulterer!
- My wife!

337
00:48:30,575 --> 00:48:33,829
Officer, look! He's cheating on me!
With a man?

338
00:48:34,037 --> 00:48:37,207
With a traitor!

339
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:39,835
You said you wouldn't touch her
with a ten-foot pole!

340
00:48:40,043 --> 00:48:41,044
It's the dentist.

341
00:48:44,089 --> 00:48:46,675
I've been spying on you
a long time, you bastard!

342
00:48:46,967 --> 00:48:49,094
And as for you,

343
00:48:49,219 --> 00:48:52,597
go steal husbands from
your own village, you whore!

344
00:49:03,984 --> 00:49:06,486
We knew she had one lover, but two?

345
00:49:06,695 --> 00:49:09,698
But where does
the dentist fit in?

346
00:49:09,823 --> 00:49:11,241
He fits in between her legs!

347
00:49:11,241 --> 00:49:15,245
Her father was forced
to quit the school in disgrace.

348
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:18,248
He never wants to see
his daughter Malèna again.

349
00:49:18,373 --> 00:49:21,626
And the dentist's wife
kicked him out of his house.

350
00:49:21,751 --> 00:49:27,215
That dragon of a wife
will drag him into court!

351
00:49:27,257 --> 00:49:30,594
What's the dentist
got to do with it, Door guy?

352
00:49:30,719 --> 00:49:33,889
Malèna's the whore!
She should be taken to court!

353
00:49:34,139 --> 00:49:36,892
That Lt. Cadet seemed
like such a gentleman.

354
00:49:37,017 --> 00:49:39,269
How could he get mixed up in this?

355
00:49:39,394 --> 00:49:42,772
Everyone knows
she's a home wrecker.

356
00:49:42,981 --> 00:49:45,150
The lieutenant was asking for it!

357
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:47,736
She's not from here.
She forgets where she is.

358
00:49:47,736 --> 00:49:48,862
Will they go to court?

359
00:49:48,904 --> 00:49:54,367
Of course, she could go to jail.
He's a married man!

360
00:49:54,409 --> 00:49:58,997
The dentist needed
three stitches in his head.

361
00:49:59,164 --> 00:50:02,542
But the dentist
swore at the soldier first.

362
00:50:02,667 --> 00:50:04,669
That's insulting an officer.

363
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:07,047
We'll all end up in court!

364
00:50:07,422 --> 00:50:10,133
While we were
watching her caboose,

365
00:50:10,175 --> 00:50:13,553
the lieutenant and the dentist
were riding the train!

366
00:51:24,708 --> 00:51:26,710
She's either going
to the lawyer's or the notary's.

367
00:51:26,751 --> 00:51:29,629
Sure, but what will she do
with two old men like them?

368
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:33,633
- Excuse me.
- Come in.

369
00:51:35,343 --> 00:51:36,595
Can I help you?

370
00:51:36,636 --> 00:51:39,347
May I speak to Lawyer Centorbi?

371
00:51:39,848 --> 00:51:41,266
Please have a seat.

372
00:51:44,269 --> 00:51:46,646
Sir, it's the widow Scordia!

373
00:51:46,771 --> 00:51:50,650
Can it be true?
Beautiful Madonna!

374
00:52:01,870 --> 00:52:03,163
Have her come in.

375
00:52:03,872 --> 00:52:05,290
- Go in.
- Thank you.

376
00:52:06,291 --> 00:52:08,293
Please sit down.

377
00:52:08,668 --> 00:52:10,170
Charmed.

378
00:52:15,675 --> 00:52:19,471
We now continue with the testimony
of Maddalena Bonsignore,

379
00:52:19,512 --> 00:52:22,807
the widow Scordia called Malèna.

380
00:52:24,392 --> 00:52:26,186
She could get two years in prison.

381
00:52:28,521 --> 00:52:30,690
Everything will be fine, trust me.

382
00:52:37,697 --> 00:52:38,948
Sit down.

383
00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:51,211
You're accused of involving
Dr. Gaspare Cusimano...

384
00:52:51,336 --> 00:52:55,090
in a secret and
amorous relationship...

385
00:52:55,215 --> 00:52:57,425
aimed at breaking up
his family.

386
00:52:57,592 --> 00:53:00,470
Do you know Dr. Cusimano?

387
00:53:01,721 --> 00:53:02,722
Yes.

388
00:53:02,806 --> 00:53:07,602
Are you or have you ever...
been his fiancee?

389
00:53:07,936 --> 00:53:10,188
Absolutely not.

390
00:53:10,355 --> 00:53:12,857
How could I be engaged
to a married man?

391
00:53:12,982 --> 00:53:16,695
Why was Cusimano,
at that unusual hour...

392
00:53:16,736 --> 00:53:18,822
on his way to your house?

393
00:53:18,863 --> 00:53:20,073
I don't know.

394
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:24,327
Had he been in your company
on previous evenings?

395
00:53:40,510 --> 00:53:42,220
Yes, once.

396
00:53:47,517 --> 00:53:49,853
- Where?
- At my house.

397
00:53:57,026 --> 00:53:59,738
Jumped right in, the dentist did.
He looks stupid, but...

398
00:53:59,904 --> 00:54:05,368
- How long did he stay?
- Not long.

399
00:54:05,535 --> 00:54:06,536
What did you do?

400
00:54:08,538 --> 00:54:11,166
He brought me some medicine
for my father.

401
00:54:13,293 --> 00:54:17,046
If it was for your father,
why did he bring it to you?

402
00:54:17,547 --> 00:54:18,548
I don't know.

403
00:54:19,799 --> 00:54:23,762
What did you do after
he gave you the medicine?

404
00:54:23,887 --> 00:54:26,055
He said good-bye and left.

405
00:54:30,393 --> 00:54:34,397
Then why has Cusimano,
an able professional,

406
00:54:34,564 --> 00:54:36,357
who, five years ago...

407
00:54:36,399 --> 00:54:40,445
had the honor of extracting
one of Il Duce's teeth...

408
00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:42,697
publicly declared
that he is your fiance?

409
00:54:42,947 --> 00:54:47,327
He made that up.
I had nothing to do with it.

410
00:54:47,577 --> 00:54:49,204
Your husband's crazy.

411
00:54:49,454 --> 00:54:54,250
What kind of relationship
did you have with Lt. Cadet?

412
00:54:57,086 --> 00:55:02,342
I'm a widow. My business
and that of Lt. Cadet...

413
00:55:02,467 --> 00:55:04,677
are no concern of the law.

414
00:55:06,679 --> 00:55:10,350
All right.
Did you know that,

415
00:55:10,725 --> 00:55:14,354
as a result of these affairs,
Lt. Cadet was transferred to Albania?

416
00:55:14,479 --> 00:55:15,522
One down.

417
00:55:15,563 --> 00:55:19,067
And before his departure,
he was questioned in judicial inquiry.

418
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:20,443
Clerk.

419
00:55:20,485 --> 00:55:22,946
He declared to have encountered

420
00:55:23,071 --> 00:55:27,492
the widow Scordia only twice...
in her home,

421
00:55:27,492 --> 00:55:31,955
and to have had
no amorous relationship...

422
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:36,459
considering their relationship
"just a casual friendship."

423
00:55:40,255 --> 00:55:41,464
Son of a bitch.

424
00:55:41,589 --> 00:55:45,635
Lt. Cadet was received by my client...

425
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:50,265
and she makes no secret
about having had for him...

426
00:55:50,515 --> 00:55:53,017
certain feelings.

427
00:55:53,142 --> 00:55:56,646
But unlike the married Cusimano,

428
00:55:57,021 --> 00:56:01,776
who was, let's face it, guilty...

429
00:56:01,985 --> 00:56:04,654
of senile dimming of the senses...

430
00:56:05,405 --> 00:56:07,657
of an intoxicating
kaleidoscope of desires...

431
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:13,288
Unlike the family man Cusimano...

432
00:56:13,371 --> 00:56:15,498
Cadet is...

433
00:56:15,748 --> 00:56:19,752
and was...

434
00:56:20,003 --> 00:56:21,170
a bachelor... a bachelor!

435
00:56:21,379 --> 00:56:23,381
Clever, that lawyer.

436
00:56:23,882 --> 00:56:25,425
He's a bachelor himself.

437
00:56:25,925 --> 00:56:30,763
Careful investigation
of the facts tell us, therefore...

438
00:56:31,055 --> 00:56:34,183
that the Scordia woman
committed no other crime...

439
00:56:34,309 --> 00:56:36,936
than that of being ill-fated,

440
00:56:37,186 --> 00:56:40,815
alone and beautiful.

441
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:43,067
Here is her crime - her beauty!

442
00:56:43,192 --> 00:56:44,736
And from here, the envy,

443
00:56:44,777 --> 00:56:47,322
the lies, the disgrace,

444
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:50,867
that have deprived her
even of a father's trust!

445
00:56:50,909 --> 00:56:55,538
And yet, she herself
is still in silent agony...

446
00:56:56,372 --> 00:56:59,417
mourning over
that unmarked war grave...

447
00:57:00,335 --> 00:57:05,715
in faraway East Africa.

448
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:10,178
In the beating heart of our argument...

449
00:57:10,303 --> 00:57:14,933
is an audacious,
but nonetheless valid, thesis...

450
00:57:15,224 --> 00:57:17,060
which asks just one question

451
00:57:17,101 --> 00:57:19,312
Can a young woman...

452
00:57:19,437 --> 00:57:24,275
after the odyssey of a widowhood
endured for the love of country...

453
00:57:24,317 --> 00:57:29,489
hope for protection
in the shelter of a new life?

454
00:57:29,614 --> 00:57:32,992
Does she have the right
to yearn for, and to write...

455
00:57:33,201 --> 00:57:36,245
a new ending to her own love story?

456
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:39,082
Your Honor,

457
00:57:39,248 --> 00:57:41,459
the citizens of Castelcuto reply:
"Yes!"

458
00:57:52,887 --> 00:57:55,139
Will Cusimano
leave me alone now?

459
00:57:55,348 --> 00:58:00,103
Of course. He's been put
into a psychiatric clinic.

460
00:58:00,269 --> 00:58:03,272
He wants to volunteer
for the Forces in East Africa.

461
00:58:03,898 --> 00:58:08,236
He doesn't realize
we lost Africa ages ago!

462
00:58:08,361 --> 00:58:12,281
But let's forget Cusimano
and the fickle Lt. Cadet.

463
00:58:12,532 --> 00:58:14,659
Let's get to us!

464
00:58:17,662 --> 00:58:20,748
I know it's not much.

465
00:58:20,873 --> 00:58:24,460
But it's all I have.
They've cut my pension.

466
00:58:24,919 --> 00:58:26,921
Don't you understand?

467
00:58:27,130 --> 00:58:29,674
That's peanuts!

468
00:58:30,299 --> 00:58:32,552
My fee is much more than that.

469
00:58:32,885 --> 00:58:36,556
You'll never have enough money!

470
00:58:36,681 --> 00:58:39,684
But how will I ever repay you?

471
00:58:39,809 --> 00:58:42,687
It's very easy, my sweet.

472
00:58:42,770 --> 00:58:47,066
- What are you saying?
- Be with me, my love!

473
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,027
I'm in love with you!

474
00:58:54,323 --> 00:58:56,409
A woman shouldn't be alone
during these hard times.

475
00:58:57,201 --> 00:58:59,787
I am a wealthy man.
You won't find better.

476
00:59:02,457 --> 00:59:05,001
I'll take care of your father.
You'll never have to worry again.

477
00:59:28,983 --> 00:59:33,488
I forgive her. She did it
to pay her lawyer's fees

478
00:59:33,571 --> 00:59:35,114
only once and never again.

479
00:59:35,239 --> 00:59:37,492
But you didn't keep our agreement.

480
00:59:39,368 --> 00:59:41,204
Now we're even.

481
01:01:52,126 --> 01:01:55,087
Signora Malèna,
a more capable person than me...

482
01:01:55,254 --> 01:01:59,008
wrote that the only true love
is unrequited love.

483
01:01:59,133 --> 01:02:00,885
Now I understand why.

484
01:02:01,219 --> 01:02:04,138
It's been so long since you
last came out of your house.

485
01:02:04,263 --> 01:02:07,767
But the longer we are apart,
the stronger my love becomes.

486
01:02:08,351 --> 01:02:12,521
They say you're about to marry
Centorbi, the lawyer.

487
01:02:12,647 --> 01:02:14,649
I know how badly
they treat you here,

488
01:02:14,774 --> 01:02:18,236
how the women in the market
won't sell you any good food...

489
01:02:18,402 --> 01:02:20,780
and no man would hire you
for fear of his wife.

490
01:02:20,905 --> 01:02:25,159
But how will you manage to live
with a fat, old man...

491
01:02:25,368 --> 01:02:28,496
so ugly that no girl
ever wanted him?

492
01:02:28,746 --> 01:02:33,501
They say he never washes
and stinks like a goat.

493
01:02:33,793 --> 01:02:36,712
How will your smooth, white skin...
bear rubbing against

494
01:02:36,879 --> 01:02:38,923
the sweat of an old man...

495
01:02:39,173 --> 01:02:42,927
who never does anything
without his mother's consent?

496
01:03:08,828 --> 01:03:11,038
Is it true you're getting married?

497
01:03:11,956 --> 01:03:14,417
What are you writing?

498
01:03:14,458 --> 01:03:17,545
Give me that!
Let me see!

499
01:03:18,087 --> 01:03:19,672
Get out!

500
01:03:42,611 --> 01:03:44,613
Stand up straight.

501
01:03:44,697 --> 01:03:46,741
A little longer, Don Placido.

502
01:03:46,866 --> 01:03:50,870
More room in the waist,
for when he gets bigger.

503
01:03:50,953 --> 01:03:52,121
Will they be ready tomorrow?

504
01:03:52,204 --> 01:03:56,000
The war has ruined
my business, but it still takes time.

505
01:03:56,125 --> 01:03:58,377
As Allied bombings continue.

506
01:04:05,384 --> 01:04:06,385
Wait for me.

507
01:04:09,638 --> 01:04:12,641
Lord, help me with my mother,
I beg you.

508
01:04:18,856 --> 01:04:21,025
Moron! Idiot!

509
01:04:21,233 --> 01:04:22,360
Idiot!

510
01:04:22,526 --> 01:04:24,528
You can't treat me like a child.
I'm a grown man!

511
01:04:24,904 --> 01:04:27,239
Get this straight.
Your father's good name...

512
01:04:27,281 --> 01:04:30,910
will never belong
to that disgusting whore!

513
01:04:30,910 --> 01:04:33,245
Never! Never!

514
01:04:33,287 --> 01:04:37,541
Never!

515
01:05:01,816 --> 01:05:03,776
The lawyer was left
high and dry!

516
01:05:03,901 --> 01:05:07,321
His mother still bathes him
every Saturday!

517
01:05:07,863 --> 01:05:10,825
Malèna always has someone
throwing a wrench in the works!

518
01:05:10,908 --> 01:05:14,578
It won't be hard finding someone
to replace the lawyer!

519
01:05:14,829 --> 01:05:20,292
- Come on, sit down.
- The next in line already has a plan.

520
01:05:20,334 --> 01:05:22,837
Yeah, his plan
is in his pants.

521
01:05:23,671 --> 01:05:25,881
- A cut and shave.
- Right away, sir.

522
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:52,384
Good morning, Antonio.

523
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:55,304
I brought some sugar and flour.

524
01:06:55,513 --> 01:06:57,681
- What about the bread?
- The best.

525
01:07:02,436 --> 01:07:05,689
- I can't pay right now.
- That's no problem.

526
01:07:05,814 --> 01:07:08,901
I'm sure we can find a way
to make you some money.

527
01:08:15,718 --> 01:08:18,262
Hurry, there's someone else over here!

528
01:08:39,867 --> 01:08:41,994
It's Professor Bonsignore.

529
01:08:43,203 --> 01:08:45,247
Malèna's father.

530
01:09:51,063 --> 01:09:52,773
I'm here for you.

531
01:09:55,776 --> 01:09:57,444
Condolences, Signora Scordia.

532
01:09:59,697 --> 01:10:01,699
Condolences.

533
01:10:06,578 --> 01:10:08,330
Step aside, kid.

534
01:10:08,330 --> 01:10:11,041
Signora, what can we do?
We're in the Lord's hands.

535
01:10:11,083 --> 01:10:12,084
Don't forget my offer.

536
01:12:58,834 --> 01:13:01,128
- Who is it?
- It's me.

537
01:13:01,378 --> 01:13:02,880
- Me who?
- Salvatore. Antonio sent me.

538
01:13:02,963 --> 01:13:05,716
I brought you some more food.

539
01:13:06,967 --> 01:13:08,135
Come in.

540
01:13:22,774 --> 01:13:25,110
- Your hair looks terrific.
- Do you like it?

541
01:13:25,277 --> 01:13:29,114
- Yes, it makes you look younger.
- Thank you.

542
01:13:43,795 --> 01:13:45,672
I can come every Thursday!

543
01:13:45,923 --> 01:13:47,507
As long as you bring the food.

544
01:14:21,333 --> 01:14:25,212
Never before in our history have
we been called upon to band together.

545
01:14:25,295 --> 01:14:28,215
Just a few years ago,
Il Duce promised

546
01:14:28,298 --> 01:14:31,885
that the Nazis would
never occupy Sicily.

547
01:14:31,927 --> 01:14:33,804
Look! The Germans are everywhere!

548
01:14:35,097 --> 01:14:36,974
Look who's here.

549
01:14:59,746 --> 01:15:01,123
She's a redhead now.

550
01:15:01,873 --> 01:15:04,001
Look how she's put together.

551
01:15:04,126 --> 01:15:06,461
I'd like to cut off that hair.

552
01:15:18,348 --> 01:15:19,766
How disgusting!

553
01:17:12,504 --> 01:17:14,339
Now she's even screwing the Germans.

554
01:17:14,464 --> 01:17:18,343
- Who's that?
- Malèna Scordia, the slut.

555
01:17:18,385 --> 01:17:21,638
She's teamed up
with that other whore, Gina.

556
01:17:21,763 --> 01:17:24,516
But with the Germans?

557
01:17:24,766 --> 01:17:28,145
Seems there are gymnastics
at the Moderno Hotel.

558
01:17:28,603 --> 01:17:31,398
The two whores run
from room to room...

559
01:17:31,982 --> 01:17:35,360
servicing a dozen officers at a time.

560
01:17:35,485 --> 01:17:37,279
Holy shit!

561
01:18:08,643 --> 01:18:11,938
My good woman, this child
is possessed by the devil!

562
01:18:13,190 --> 01:18:14,316
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

563
01:18:23,533 --> 01:18:24,534
Rosa!

564
01:18:27,662 --> 01:18:29,206
Come here!

565
01:18:30,707 --> 01:18:32,417
That's enough!

566
01:18:32,709 --> 01:18:35,670
It looks like you're posing
for Michelangelo's Pieta of the poor!

567
01:18:36,338 --> 01:18:37,339
No.

568
01:18:37,839 --> 01:18:40,967
Evil eye on blood is fed.
Hold on fast till death is past.

569
01:18:41,092 --> 01:18:44,346
Exorcise the devil
from this child.

570
01:18:44,554 --> 01:18:46,306
Goat red, on wood fed,
hold on fast.

571
01:18:46,431 --> 01:18:48,975
Head and tail,
evil eye release this child.

572
01:18:49,351 --> 01:18:51,478
Cast the devil into the wild.

573
01:18:52,729 --> 01:18:54,231
Shameful!

574
01:18:54,356 --> 01:18:57,859
Disgraceful!

575
01:18:57,984 --> 01:19:02,989
They cured my uncle this way...
and he had cholera!

576
01:19:03,114 --> 01:19:05,867
Your son's not sick!
He's becoming a man!

577
01:19:05,951 --> 01:19:09,120
With a dick this big,
he needs to fuck!

578
01:19:18,463 --> 01:19:19,631
Renato!

579
01:19:26,137 --> 01:19:28,014
Renato, wait here for me.

580
01:19:35,522 --> 01:19:38,358
Come here. Come on.
Close the door.

581
01:19:38,525 --> 01:19:40,902
- My father?
- He's coming.

582
01:19:41,528 --> 01:19:43,738
Ladies!

583
01:19:43,780 --> 01:19:45,657
Choose the one you like.

584
01:19:45,740 --> 01:19:48,743
Ladies!

585
01:19:48,868 --> 01:19:50,745
What do we have here?

586
01:19:50,912 --> 01:19:52,789
Fresh young meat.

587
01:20:59,189 --> 01:21:01,483
Lupetta, up to the room.

588
01:21:04,861 --> 01:21:06,237
Treat him right.

589
01:21:14,579 --> 01:21:16,831
- What's your name?
- Amoroso Renato.

590
01:21:16,956 --> 01:21:18,833
Amoroso. What a romantic name!

591
01:21:19,125 --> 01:21:23,630
Tonight we either die in a bombing
or end up in jail.

592
01:21:28,259 --> 01:21:29,469
Go ahead.

593
01:23:14,199 --> 01:23:16,826
- Is it your first time?
- No.

594
01:23:18,578 --> 01:23:20,497
I've imagined it many times.

595
01:24:42,078 --> 01:24:45,665
Let's go give that shameless whore
what she deserves.

596
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:53,715
Stay back.
This is between the women.

597
01:26:22,637 --> 01:26:25,765
Now you'll see what happens
when you steal our men...

598
01:26:36,150 --> 01:26:38,319
and sleep with the filthy Germans.

599
01:26:41,072 --> 01:26:43,032
It's the end of spreading
your legs, whore!

600
01:27:00,341 --> 01:27:02,093
Now let's see
what men make of you!

601
01:27:08,349 --> 01:27:10,727
The madame is served.

602
01:28:20,129 --> 01:28:21,422
Get lost!

603
01:28:22,298 --> 01:28:24,383
Disappear!

604
01:32:18,659 --> 01:32:21,537
I know that face.
Who is it?

605
01:32:24,290 --> 01:32:26,667
Nino Scordia,
Malèna's husband.

606
01:32:26,876 --> 01:32:30,046
Malèna, the one who did it
with the Germans.

607
01:32:36,302 --> 01:32:40,264
Poor guy.
He was better off dead.

608
01:32:46,687 --> 01:32:48,314
Isn't that Malèna's husband?

609
01:33:15,466 --> 01:33:18,803
Hey, Giovanni,
there's a strange guy.

610
01:33:28,104 --> 01:33:29,730
Do you know Malèna Scordia?

611
01:33:30,606 --> 01:33:31,690
Who's she?

612
01:33:31,857 --> 01:33:34,276
Who are you?
This is my family's house!

613
01:33:34,318 --> 01:33:36,237
We don't know anything.

614
01:33:36,362 --> 01:33:39,073
When we came,
no one was living here.

615
01:33:39,198 --> 01:33:40,699
No one?

616
01:33:56,132 --> 01:33:58,843
Poor guy. No one
will tell him the truth.

617
01:33:58,884 --> 01:34:02,847
What would you say,
"I hear your wife is a prostitute"?

618
01:34:02,888 --> 01:34:06,600
I hear she's still
a great piece of ass.

619
01:34:06,767 --> 01:34:10,146
I lost an arm.
I wasn't dead!

620
01:34:10,271 --> 01:34:14,650
Then I was taken prisoner in India
and I contracted malaria. Tell him.

621
01:34:14,859 --> 01:34:17,361
Sir, he lost his arm...

622
01:34:17,528 --> 01:34:19,780
Hey, kid, what are
you doing here? Go away.

623
01:34:20,406 --> 01:34:21,657
Me "boy-bar." Coffee.

624
01:34:21,782 --> 01:34:25,703
I have to get the coffee cups.
Understand?

625
01:34:25,744 --> 01:34:26,912
Okay, okay.

626
01:34:27,913 --> 01:34:30,916
My family has lived in this town
for generations.

627
01:34:31,041 --> 01:34:33,252
Now no one will talk to me.

628
01:34:33,294 --> 01:34:35,796
My house is a refugee camp,
and my wife has disappeared.

629
01:34:35,838 --> 01:34:38,883
No one in town knows
where she is.

630
01:34:39,300 --> 01:34:41,886
His wife was the woman

631
01:34:41,927 --> 01:34:44,638
we saw beaten up
on the day we arrived here.

632
01:34:44,805 --> 01:34:47,558
Everybody says she's
a prostitute in a whorehouse.

633
01:34:47,766 --> 01:34:49,935
Help me find her.
I want to bring her home.

634
01:35:12,958 --> 01:35:17,838
Excuse me. Don't you remember me?
I'm Nino Scordia.

635
01:35:18,047 --> 01:35:21,800
- You mistake me for someone else.
- Could I have a light?

636
01:35:21,967 --> 01:35:26,639
You were the Fascist's secretary,
and you were his deputy.

637
01:35:26,847 --> 01:35:28,265
You can help me. Do you know
what happened to my wife?

638
01:35:28,307 --> 01:35:31,018
Didn't she join the Communist Party?

639
01:35:32,228 --> 01:35:36,357
She was photographed
with her arms around the Commie leader.

640
01:35:39,068 --> 01:35:41,612
You're a family of heroes!

641
01:35:43,697 --> 01:35:45,324
You're right.

642
01:35:45,866 --> 01:35:49,912
Those who fought the war
for you bastards aren't heroes.

643
01:35:51,372 --> 01:35:54,458
Go take a walk through
the brothels of Sicily.

644
01:35:54,583 --> 01:35:58,128
You may find your wife there!

645
01:36:58,689 --> 01:37:02,651
Wait a minute. Come back!

646
01:37:08,782 --> 01:37:10,451
<i>Dear Signor Scordia,</i>

647
01:37:10,659 --> 01:37:14,455
<i>forgive me if I don't have
the courage to speak man to man.</i>

648
01:37:14,788 --> 01:37:17,291
<i>These last months have
taught me much about</i>

649
01:37:17,333 --> 01:37:19,793
<i>courage, even if I
have found little myself.</i>

650
01:37:20,210 --> 01:37:22,963
<i>I'm the only one who knows
the truth about your wife.</i>

651
01:37:23,088 --> 01:37:27,343
<i>Around here, they only say
bad things about her.</i>

652
01:37:27,593 --> 01:37:31,597
<i>But believe me, your wife
Malèna was faithful to you.</i>

653
01:37:31,722 --> 01:37:35,559
<i>You are the only man she loved.
This is the honest truth.</i>

654
01:37:35,934 --> 01:37:38,520
<i>It is true,
a lot of things happened,</i>

655
01:37:38,562 --> 01:37:41,940
<i>but back then,
you had been dead a long time.</i>

656
01:37:42,232 --> 01:37:46,987
<i>The last time I saw her, she was
on a tram for Messina.</i>

657
01:37:47,237 --> 01:37:51,450
<i>I should sign "a friend,"
like all anonymous letters,</i>

658
01:37:51,617 --> 01:37:53,494
<i>but my name is Renato.</i>

659
01:38:26,402 --> 01:38:28,737
A year later

660
01:38:32,908 --> 01:38:35,661
Good morning, Judge.

661
01:38:37,663 --> 01:38:39,164
All is well, thank God.

662
01:38:41,166 --> 01:38:42,751
Eat up, my sweet pea.

663
01:38:55,556 --> 01:38:59,143
- Sons of bitches!
- Look who's here!

664
01:38:59,184 --> 01:39:01,145
Giorgio, look who's here!

665
01:40:02,873 --> 01:40:05,626
Why are you all
looking at that woman?

666
01:40:05,751 --> 01:40:07,252
It's nothing.

667
01:40:35,405 --> 01:40:38,283
I saw them in the square.
They were walking arm in arm.

668
01:40:38,367 --> 01:40:40,410
Quiet. She's here!

669
01:40:41,870 --> 01:40:44,915
It took a lot of courage to come back.

670
01:40:45,791 --> 01:40:47,417
Look who's here.

671
01:40:49,795 --> 01:40:51,547
I heard it,
but I didn't believe it.

672
01:40:51,672 --> 01:40:54,550
- What have they got to look at?
- They should leave her in peace.

673
01:40:57,553 --> 01:41:00,013
She's got some wrinkles
around her eyes.

674
01:41:00,180 --> 01:41:01,807
She's put on weight, too.

675
01:41:04,393 --> 01:41:06,311
But she's still beautiful.

676
01:41:06,645 --> 01:41:08,814
Good morning, Mrs. Scordia.

677
01:41:24,913 --> 01:41:26,164
Good morning.

678
01:41:28,333 --> 01:41:31,545
Want some nice tomatoes?
They cost less over there.

679
01:41:31,587 --> 01:41:33,964
- Good morning.
- Thank you.

680
01:41:37,050 --> 01:41:39,052
Nice things here!

681
01:41:39,928 --> 01:41:42,848
- Like it, Signora Malèna?
- Yes.

682
01:41:42,973 --> 01:41:45,350
- Try it on.
- No, that's okay.

683
01:41:45,475 --> 01:41:47,477
- It's no problem.
- Another time.

684
01:41:48,061 --> 01:41:51,857
Give me your bag.
We'll discuss it later.

685
01:41:51,982 --> 01:41:54,818
- Thank you.
- Good day.

686
01:42:54,920 --> 01:42:56,380
It's okay. I'll get it.

687
01:43:01,051 --> 01:43:02,427
Thank you.

688
01:43:05,555 --> 01:43:06,807
Thank you for your help.

689
01:43:13,146 --> 01:43:15,190
Good luck, Signora Malèna.

690
01:43:45,345 --> 01:43:48,849
<i>I pedaled as fast as I could</i>

691
01:43:49,057 --> 01:43:51,101
<i>as if I were escaping...</i>

692
01:43:51,226 --> 01:43:54,229
<i>from longing,
from innocence, from her.</i>

693
01:43:54,438 --> 01:43:56,857
<i>Time has passed,
and I have loved many women.</i>

694
01:43:57,190 --> 01:44:00,110
<i>And as they've held me close...</i>

695
01:44:00,360 --> 01:44:04,698
<i>and asked if I will
remember them,</i>

696
01:44:04,740 --> 01:44:09,995
<i>I've said,
"Yes, I will remember you."</i>

697
01:44:10,203 --> 01:44:14,082
<i>But the only one I've never forgotten
is the one who never asked...</i>

698
01:44:14,207 --> 01:44:15,375
<i>Malèna.</i>
