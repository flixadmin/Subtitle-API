1
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,785
You're in, lover.

2
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:26,458
You are too talented.

3
00:00:34,734 --> 00:00:36,565
This beautiful little battery...

4
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:41,235
...will power suburban homes
for 10 years, for next to nothing.

5
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:46,872
And by the time Star Labs
realizes it's missing...

6
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:50,539
...their competition will have it
in production already.

7
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:56,288
- You're a genius.
- I know. Let's go.

8
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,592
Oh, Stasia. I'm very disappointed.

9
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,137
But frankly, not totally surprised.

10
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:16,741
You see, I expected it.

11
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,477
So did I.

12
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,893
No hard feelings. Right, Sam?

13
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:51,034
Red Line express,
door-to-door delivery.

14
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:53,076
Hurry up and change.
We're running late.

15
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:55,646
Me? We could've taken the car
like normal people...

16
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:58,010
...if you hadn't changed
so many times.

17
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:01,015
What's the matter?

18
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:04,213
Nothing's the matter. It's only
the end of the world as I know it.

19
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:07,951
- Don't you think you're overreacting?
- You don't know my mother.

20
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:13,958
Tina, slow down.

21
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:18,771
- Barry, did you have to wear this jacket?
- She's not my mother.

22
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:28,244
Know how your father drives you nuts?
That's me and my mother.

23
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:32,180
My friends thought she was so cool,
dropping in from Paris with the latest trend.

24
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:35,082
She sounds interesting.
Hipper than my dad anyway.

25
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:39,021
I could never keep up with her.
I think I really disappointed her.

26
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:41,353
- There you are, Tina.
- Hello, Mother.

27
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:43,462
Hello, darling.

28
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:48,491
Why don't you call me Jocelyn.
After all, we're both adults.

29
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,898
My mother, Jocelyn Weller.
This is Barry Allen.

30
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,698
- I think I mentioned him in...
- Oh, the Boy Scout.

31
00:02:57,644 --> 00:02:59,236
My mistake.

32
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:01,136
Jerk.

33
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:12,253
- And what do you do, Barry?
- I don't believe it. Barry Allen?

34
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:17,326
Barry!

35
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:21,062
I see that you do rather well.

36
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:42,104
Don't tell me
you don't remember me.

37
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,774
- Stasia Masters.
- It's been a long time, huh, Barry?

38
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,618
- I haven't seen you since...
- High school.

39
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:51,617
I just got back in to town
for a few days...

40
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,589
...and I guess I was just overwhelmed
to see a friendly face.

41
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,626
Barry, do you mind?

42
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,797
It's been terrific seeing you, Barry.
Bye.

43
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,928
Barry, who was that?

44
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:07,300
Oh, I did her homework
in high school.

45
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,907
You did her homework,
or you were her homework?

46
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:12,374
Now, help us with the luggage.

47
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:15,275
I'll bet you have
an interesting secret life.

48
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:18,815
Maybe this trip
won't be so dull after all.

49
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:25,784
Thank you, darling. I'm here for the new
postmodern reconstructivist show.

50
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:31,454
- I thought you had a car.
- Oh, it's at the lab. We'll have to stop.

51
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,330
That's funny, my wallet's gone.

52
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,604
This crystal is on loan from
the government.

53
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,078
I had to pull a lot of strings
to get it here.

54
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:53,275
As you can see, it focuses the laser
onto an even tighter beam...

55
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:57,014
...allowing more accurate nucleic
manipulation of the sample tissue.

56
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:01,524
Yes, well, I'm sure that's very nice,
darling.

57
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:05,960
But how can you stand working
in a place that's so sterile?

58
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:08,259
It's a laboratory, Mother.

59
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:12,393
Star Labs has been very good to me.
They encourage me to work on my own.

60
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:16,235
Any daughter of mine
could lock herself away in such...

61
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:21,176
...an antiseptic environment... But then,
you are your father's daughter as well.

62
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:24,510
- No cracks about Daddy.
- Sorry.

63
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:28,620
There are research firms in
more civilized cities. Like New York.

64
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:32,087
- Central City has a lot to offer. It...
- That's true.

65
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:35,853
Did you know the corn dog
was invented here?

66
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,331
Yeah. Okay. Wow, look at the time.

67
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:43,299
I've got morning duty at my lab.
I'll just be...

68
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:45,460
So you play this game too?

69
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:49,072
Police sciences, forensic criminology.

70
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,403
- Really?
- Scout's honor.

71
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:57,248
From Tina's description, I expected
something rather more heroic.

72
00:06:57,784 --> 00:06:59,376
Really?

73
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,714
Heroic. Yeah.

74
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:06,856
I don't care.

75
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:11,222
Look, we have a deal,
and you better live up to it.

76
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:13,962
No.

77
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:16,995
No.

78
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,168
Listen, Fletcher, the only reason
I came back to this town...

79
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:22,432
...was to hook up with you.

80
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,940
What do you mean, two days?

81
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:28,410
Look, I think one of Sam's goons
is on to me.

82
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:32,608
How? I don't know how.
But if I can't unload this battery...

83
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:38,788
I'd like a romantic table for two,
next to that lovely blond.

84
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:40,885
I gotta go.

85
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:55,470
- Well, what looks good, Marceau?
- I don't know.

86
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:59,702
How about the poached shark?
Or the eel?

87
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:02,571
Or the rat?

88
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:05,683
Buy you lunch, Stasia?

89
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:09,083
Talent. How's it going?

90
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:13,919
Doll face, Sam said you'd
be passing through town.

91
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:16,960
Yeah? Well, give him my best.

92
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:22,465
He also said you had something of his.
Maybe it's in here, huh?

93
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:41,146
I can't believe you junk-food junkies
never had a Lucky Dog.

94
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,788
These are the best,
and I should know. Go ahead.

95
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:47,517
I want two chili dogs with everything,
especially that orange, shiny sauce.

96
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:50,753
- Oh, Murph, that is pure grease.
- To you, Bellows.

97
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:54,661
- To me, it's secret sauce. Join me?
- No, thanks.

98
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:58,167
Corn dog, please.
See, I support our city's heritage.

99
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:09,573
- Hey, those guys are packing.
- Stay low, Barry. We'll handle this.

100
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:16,053
Freeze and drop them!

101
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:21,259
Cover me!

102
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:53,654
Hey, get out of the street.

103
00:09:57,897 --> 00:10:00,127
Go. Go!

104
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:04,298
Murph, I lost the other guy.

105
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,030
Things really got nuts after
that cowboy showed up.

106
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:09,003
- Cowboy?
- Yeah.

107
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:13,635
- Right before the Flash saved my neck.
- Oh, now it's the Flash and Pecos Bill.

108
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:17,681
Partner, your brain
is a-jingle-jangle-jingling.

109
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,978
Fletcher. I was right,
Tom's got a line on me.

110
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:24,816
Now look, if I'm gonna wait for you,
I'm gonna need some help.

111
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:27,983
What do you mean,
that's my problem?

112
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,226
Okay. Okay, I'll handle it, Fletcher.

113
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:34,628
But you've got exactly 48 hours
to show up...

114
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,394
...or I'm gonna throw this damn battery
in the river.

115
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,970
Yeah, I love you too.

116
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,607
I'm dead. I'm dead.

117
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:45,505
I gotta find someplace to hide. L...

118
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:49,841
I've gotta find someone to help me.

119
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:54,884
Out of nowhere, this woman
plants a lip-lock on me, right?

120
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:59,320
It's Stasia. Haven't seen her in 15 years,
since she streaked high school graduation.

121
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:02,188
- You two were an item?
- No, she ran with a different crowd.

122
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:05,194
Bikers, outlaws.
I tutored her in chemistry.

123
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:07,161
- When you guys getting together?
- What?

124
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,665
Come on, dinner, dancing,
skydiving, whatever.

125
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,962
- This isn't high school.
- That's the thing.

126
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:14,072
It was so fast,
I didn't get her number.

127
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,676
Who says you don't get
a second chance in this life?

128
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,471
Stasia.

129
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,644
You know, I never would've
figured you for a cop, Barry.

130
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:25,647
I thought you'd be teaching
somewhere.

131
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:30,221
Helping all those eager young coeds
with their homework.

132
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:32,857
What are you doing here?

133
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,583
Must have fallen into my purse.

134
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:37,891
You know, when we were kissing.

135
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:41,266
Every penny's there. You can count it.

136
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:48,034
Stasia Masters, this is Julio Mendez.

137
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,004
Hi. I heard a lot about you.

138
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:53,339
It's hard to believe you and Barry
were in the same class.

139
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:59,615
Yeah. Well, I better go. There's
a science crime I have to prevent.

140
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:03,050
- It was nice meeting you.
- Likewise.

141
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:08,286
So who would have thought,
after all these years, huh?

142
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:14,661
Well, a lot of things have changed
around here. The city, me.

143
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:16,930
Tell me about it.

144
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:21,730
- Well...
- What about this Flash?

145
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,704
I mean, where'd this guy come from?

146
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:28,009
Your guess is as good as mine, really.

147
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:31,445
Unclassifiable urban phenomena,
you know.

148
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:35,144
- Real mystery man, huh?
- Yeah.

149
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,223
What made you come back
to Central City?

150
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,627
Rendezvous with an old boyfriend.

151
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:46,726
I thought something was still there...

152
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,598
...but things went bad real fast.

153
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,104
He became very abusive.

154
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:57,605
Story of my life, huh?

155
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:03,145
Maybe I wouldn't be so screwed up if
I'd dated someone like you in high school.

156
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:07,617
Anyway, now that my plans
have been shot to hell...

157
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,051
...I gotta figure out
what I'm gonna do next.

158
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:13,749
I tried calling a couple of my old friends,
but I didn't have much luck.

159
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,788
I guess I should try
and find a hotel...

160
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:22,056
...but hotels are so cold. Lonely.

161
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,400
Well, I...

162
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:30,633
You could stay at my...
You could stay with me.

163
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:33,134
- Really?
- Yeah.

164
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:38,816
Oh, Barry, you are a lifesaver.
Thank you.

165
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:06,304
Hey, you.

166
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:10,641
I didn't hear you, Sam.
You scared the pants off...

167
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:14,049
You.

168
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:17,816
- Keep your pants on, Talent.
- How the hell do you do that?

169
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:20,255
It's all done with mirrors...

170
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,891
...and stolen technology.

171
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:27,729
- Where's Stasia?
- Well, I had her, but I lost her.

172
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:31,427
A little interference from
a local creep. The Flash.

173
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:34,539
The guy gives me the willies.
Comes out of nowhere, then, zip...

174
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:39,371
...he's gone. Can't be human.
Ectoplasm, that's what I think.

175
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:43,208
Well, Flash or no Flash, I want you
to find Stasia and bring her to me.

176
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:47,614
Sure. But I'm telling you, as a friend,
that girl is no-good.

177
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:52,348
Just find Stasia. And make sure
she has the battery, okay?

178
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:55,922
- Okay.
- The Central City Star Labs...

179
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:59,462
...has something of interest.
I think I'll put in an appearance.

180
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:09,302
Better check that guy
for ectoplasm too.

181
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,940
Mother... Jocelyn.

182
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:14,045
I'm on my way home.

183
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:16,143
Where are you going?

184
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:18,848
But I was cooking dinner tonight.

185
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:21,984
Okay.

186
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:24,179
You have the spare keys?

187
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:28,190
Right. Fine.

188
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:06,329
McGee, you forget your keys again,
you're fired.

189
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:15,269
Oh, my God!

190
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:47,471
Damn it. Wrong one.

191
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,050
I tried the extinguisher,
but it didn't work.

192
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:07,187
What is this damn mime doing here?
He just popped out of nowhere.

193
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,301
Hey, where are you going?
Put the fire out.

194
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:19,294
Wait!

195
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:33,016
I'm losing my mind.

196
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:41,250
- Dinner was sensational. Thank you.
- Yeah, what I could see of it.

197
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:45,454
- Was that place dark enough?
- Oh, it wasn't that bad.

198
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:50,892
Listen, I want to thank you
for letting me stay here.

199
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,937
I really do feel safe with you.

200
00:17:56,208 --> 00:18:00,235
So bottom line on this Flash,
did somebody build him?

201
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,039
- Build him?
- Yeah.

202
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:04,580
What do you mean?
Like some kind of...

203
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:09,312
...mad scientist? Some Professor Zoom...?
- Sure. Some eccentric professor...

204
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:14,118
...in some top-secret lab somewhere. Think
of the fortune to be made on that research.

205
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:17,319
You know, all we did through dinner
was talk about the Flash.

206
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:20,590
- I'm feeling left out.
- Yeah?

207
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,097
- Yeah.
- Are you jealous?

208
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:25,259
- A little.
- Good.

209
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:32,371
Hello?

210
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:35,813
Yeah, this is his place. Who's this?

211
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,678
Hold on a second.

212
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:42,116
- Tina.
- Tina? Tina, hi.

213
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:44,983
Slow down.

214
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:47,522
What?

215
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,890
All right, yeah. I'll be right over. Yeah.

216
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:53,293
Yeah, sure. Bye. Bye.

217
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:57,100
- I gotta go.
- What, are you and Tina...?

218
00:18:57,269 --> 00:19:01,467
Just friends. We're intimate,
yet platonic.

219
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:05,006
You know something,
you really are a nice guy.

220
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:07,145
Yeah, well...

221
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,904
- Make yourself at home.
- Okay.

222
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:11,072
- I might be a while.
- All right.

223
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,343
- Hurry back.
- Yeah.

224
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:15,947
Bye.

225
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:26,158
Yes.

226
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:32,235
Don't even think about using this
as a chew toy, Fido...

227
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:34,429
...or you're not gonna have a tail
to wag.

228
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:37,131
You see what I mean? No burns, nothing.

229
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:40,472
- Mimes, vanishing firemen.
- You're not the only one hallucinating.

230
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:43,945
I saw a cowboy, complete with rope tricks,
evaporate in front of me.

231
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:46,516
I don't know your excuse is,
but I think my mother...

232
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:49,813
...is pushing me over the edge.
- What? Come on. She just got here.

233
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:52,479
Yes, and we quarreled all afternoon.

234
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:54,956
- You need some tea.
- The heating coils are broken.

235
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:56,856
Not a problem.

236
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:05,729
It's as if she resents me for not going
with her when she left my father.

237
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:07,667
Why didn't you?

238
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:10,831
I was 13 years old. He was crushed.

239
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:14,172
All of a sudden, I had to play grownup
and take care of him.

240
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:17,179
I didn't think Mother wanted
to be burdened with a daughter...

241
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:18,976
...while she was finding herself.

242
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:22,181
Here, have some tea.

243
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:27,918
Tina, what's this?

244
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:37,502
I guess you're not so crazy
as you thought.

245
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:40,832
That's the most sophisticated
image projection I've ever seen.

246
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:45,500
- But why? Some practical joke?
- Maybe, it's a distraction for a theft.

247
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:48,405
That crystal in the laser sight.

248
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,571
- But it's still in its housing.
- Is it?

249
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:02,491
Tina, you've been robbed.

250
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:05,824
That crystal's irreplaceable.
It cost a fortune.

251
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:08,762
- Between this and the California robbery...
- California?

252
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:13,301
A prototype long-term generator was
taken from our Silicon Valley branch.

253
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:15,167
My God, Barry,
what am I gonna do?

254
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:18,303
- It's not your fault.
- Yes, it is.

255
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:23,141
The Research Bureau didn't want the crystal
to leave Washington, but I insisted.

256
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:26,443
If we don't get this crystal back,
I'm gonna lose my job.

257
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,142
Then we'll get it back.

258
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:33,453
Now, a stone that unique would probably
have to be cut before it was sold, right?

259
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:37,693
A high-density crystal, if it could be
cut at all, would need a powerful laser.

260
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:40,826
All right, then if the thief
is attempting to cut it...

261
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:44,162
...we can track abnormal power surges
through the city.

262
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:46,861
I can break into Water and Power.

263
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,201
Fox and Broom.

264
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:57,511
The hotel on Fantino.

265
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:14,465
Damn it. It's useless. I can't cut it.

266
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:18,626
- It's gonna be hard to sell at that size.
- Yeah, but not impossible.

267
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:23,639
It's just gonna take a little more time
to find the right buyer. But when I do...

268
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:25,834
Seven figures?

269
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,740
Maybe eight.

270
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,747
Now, what about the girl?

271
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:35,182
- She dropped out of circulation.
- Find her, Talent. You owe me.

272
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:40,351
You know, maybe if I try splitting
the crystal on a different axis.

273
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,459
Sam...

274
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:45,460
...I don't think you should slice
the rock at all.

275
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:48,599
I'd rather sell it for one big score.

276
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:50,200
Be smart, Talent.

277
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:53,600
You haven't the faintest idea how
to move that stone into the market.

278
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:55,706
I'll learn.

279
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:59,472
Hey. Where do you
think you're going?

280
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:02,876
Well, since you're obviously
not working for me anymore...

281
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:06,916
...I guess I'll have to find Stasia myself.
- It's not gonna work that way, Sam.

282
00:23:07,652 --> 00:23:13,852
Oh, really? What are you gonna do,
kill me right here? I don't think so.

283
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:19,961
In here, gentlemen. He's the one
who stole the Star Labs crystal.

284
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:24,831
Hold on. You got the wrong guy.
What's the deal here?

285
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:28,939
You're bought, aren't you?
Scudder, you lousy...

286
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:35,106
Thank you, officers.

287
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:39,243
I hope you didn't disturb
the other guests.

288
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:48,689
Well, the Flash.

289
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,351
Did you know that
three East Coast crime families...

290
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:54,795
...have commissioned studies on you?
- I want the Star Labs' crystal.

291
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:58,367
- Who put you on to me? Was it the girl?
- What girl?

292
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:01,002
Look...

293
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:04,308
...how much for you to forget
you ever saw me, take a walk?

294
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:06,569
I'm not for sale.

295
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:08,536
Everybody has his price.

296
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:17,986
- I've seen this picture.
- I don't think I'm there anymore.

297
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:46,816
Come on, Fletcher.

298
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,051
It's me.

299
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:54,691
Yeah, I still got the battery.

300
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:57,954
But the longer I have to squat in
this burg, the higher the price.

301
00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:01,496
You don't show by tomorrow night,
the deal is off.

302
00:25:08,406 --> 00:25:12,001
You know, some things
I'll put up with.

303
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:15,675
But getting double-crossed
by the woman I love...

304
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:19,442
...is definitely not one of them, babe.

305
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:22,115
- Sam, you don't know how good...
- What?

306
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:26,223
"How good it is to see you"?
You left me for the wolves, Stasia.

307
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:29,958
If I'd have been out 10 seconds longer,
they would've caught me.

308
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:31,459
But you...

309
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,723
...you were too confident.

310
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:36,959
You left a trail like a tracer bullet.

311
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:39,035
All I had to do was...

312
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:43,197
...check your credit cards,
call your travel agent.

313
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:47,069
Sam, you gotta believe me, baby.

314
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:50,976
I didn't wanna do it. I was in trouble.
I owed some people money.

315
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:53,743
Save it. Save it for a new sucker.

316
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,251
I want the battery. Now.

317
00:25:57,088 --> 00:25:59,249
- I sold it.
- Yeah, you sold it?

318
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:02,120
- I got a line on something...
- You always got a line.

319
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:05,661
I do, baby. I got a line on
the mother lode this time.

320
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,593
Make me believe.

321
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:09,728
I can get you the Flash.

322
00:26:28,186 --> 00:26:29,517
You're lying.

323
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:31,718
- No. I'm not.
- Yeah, you're lying.

324
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:36,156
I swear to you. I sold the battery
to this eccentric scientist.

325
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:40,765
- Guy calls himself Professor Zoom.
- Professor Zoom?

326
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:43,799
Yeah. Turns out he's the guy
who created the Flash.

327
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:47,700
Some sort of bioengineering process,
something like that.

328
00:26:47,872 --> 00:26:51,399
And he's willing to give you
the formula, huh?

329
00:26:51,676 --> 00:26:55,669
Well, come on, baby,
I can convince him. You know?

330
00:26:56,715 --> 00:27:01,175
Don't be too persuasive, love. Okay?

331
00:27:02,587 --> 00:27:05,852
Come on, he's the paranoid type.
You know how these geniuses are.

332
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:08,015
- Yeah?
- I'll probably have to be alone...

333
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:10,093
...to arrange a meet.
- Yeah?

334
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:14,857
But just think of it. Think of the price
the Flash will bring on the market.

335
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:17,365
Think of the money.

336
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:21,004
You can play with my heart...

337
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:25,074
...but messing with my business
is gonna get you hurt.

338
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:27,803
I have a reputation to uphold.

339
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:31,471
You have 24 hours.

340
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:35,912
But the next few, they belong to me.

341
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:56,133
You must have had a great time
last night to look this wasted.

342
00:27:57,075 --> 00:28:01,171
- I got no sleep at all last night, all right?
- You dog.

343
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:05,339
- Come on, give me details.
- No details, no story.

344
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:09,715
I left the apartment for a couple of hours.
And when I got back, she was gone.

345
00:28:09,888 --> 00:28:11,719
- That's not a good sign.
- No.

346
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:15,155
Stasia's playing some kind of a game.
I'm being used.

347
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:19,387
I'd be willing to bet the farm
that you'd stand in line for more abuse.

348
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:21,862
Barry.

349
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:23,466
Barry, look.

350
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:27,230
Every guy has a woman in his life that
will pop up out of nowhere and just...

351
00:28:27,405 --> 00:28:32,138
...turn his whole world upside down.
In my case, it was Elena Tobias.

352
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:35,609
I don't have any idea what
she's been up to for the last 15 years.

353
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:40,547
Well, if it's bad, we're definitely
in the position to find out.

354
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:44,085
No.

355
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:47,380
Oh, no. No, Julio, come on,
that wouldn't be right.

356
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,993
Come on. No one would know
that you're checking.

357
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:51,594
How bad could it be?

358
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:57,596
- Anastasia Masters.
- All right.

359
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:05,405
Hey, look, you have no choice, pal.
You're a cop, all right?

360
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:10,605
Take a look. Just petty larceny.
Six months served when she was 20.

361
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:14,149
Until you get to her last arrest
four years ago.

362
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:17,982
Industrial sabotage. Hooked up
with a guy named Scudder.

363
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:22,490
Used high-tech holograms.
Nicknamed Mirror Master.

364
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,719
The file on him is very thin.

365
00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:28,195
So your dream date and Scudder
are connected.

366
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:31,665
Her dance cards and our mug books
have a lot in common.

367
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:36,335
I don't wanna believe Stasia's involved
with the crystal theft...

368
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:40,376
...but anything new on those mirror disks?
- Stolen from a government laboratory...

369
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:44,072
...along with a holographic camera
small enough to wear on your wrist.

370
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:47,412
Oh, I'm so depressed about this robbery,
I can barely talk about it.

371
00:29:47,585 --> 00:29:51,351
I didn't actually see the crystal in
the hotel room, but I believe it was there.

372
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:54,356
And I'm sure the man
was Samuel Scudder.

373
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:58,758
I'll get that crystal back for you.
And the first step is to find Stasia.

374
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:02,889
- Meanwhile, how do I deal with this?
- Oh, this. Well...

375
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:07,436
...the way to get through these things is,
you never talk much about the work. Okay?

376
00:30:07,605 --> 00:30:11,439
And when you do, try to use "duality"
and "juxtaposition" in the same sentence.

377
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:15,568
It is without a doubt
a skillful juxtaposition of duality.

378
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:19,979
This is one of the most
beautiful paintings I've ever seen.

379
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:24,247
A perfect marriage of line and color.

380
00:30:24,422 --> 00:30:27,858
I will take it, sir. It's magnificent.

381
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:38,666
I'm glad you both could make it.
The work's going over awfully well.

382
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:44,707
- This city's starved for culture.
- I'm just starved. See you in a minute.

383
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:49,804
I must say, Barry's quite a surprise.

384
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:53,382
- He's not like the men you used to date.
- How would you know?

385
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:56,076
You were never around to see the men
I went out with.

386
00:30:56,254 --> 00:30:59,917
Well, they were so straight
and academic. Like your husband.

387
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:04,391
You never knew David. He was
a sweet, funny, passionate man.

388
00:31:04,562 --> 00:31:06,792
You never even made it to the funeral.

389
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:10,360
- I meant to. I was just in the middle of...
- Damned right.

390
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,594
- Always in the middle of something.
- Tina!

391
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:16,297
You ran out on my father and you ran
out on me. If you want a daughter...

392
00:31:16,474 --> 00:31:18,101
...start acting like a mother.

393
00:31:26,484 --> 00:31:28,418
You going after her?

394
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:32,079
- I have a show to deal with.
- Jocelyn, wait.

395
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,550
Tina's going through a hard time
right now.

396
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,492
She might lose her job
over the crystal robbery.

397
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:42,997
I think it would help
if you would just talk to her.

398
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:45,662
Let her know you're concerned.

399
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:49,235
Yes, I suppose I should.

400
00:31:49,874 --> 00:31:52,638
Perhaps when I'm through
with all of this.

401
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:55,836
Oh, it looks like they're selling
another picture.

402
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:00,348
Excuse me.

403
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:07,990
You probably hate me, huh?

404
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:16,157
I'm sorry I disappeared on you
last night.

405
00:32:16,801 --> 00:32:19,998
- I guess you think I'm pretty terrible.
- According to your rap sheet.

406
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:22,503
- My rap sheet?
- Yeah, when you didn't come back...

407
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:25,939
...I guess my cop instincts took over,
what can I say?

408
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:31,882
All right, Barry. I admit it. I'm no angel.
But I've gone straight.

409
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:37,588
- I have. Honestly.
- What about your boyfriend, Scudder?

410
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:40,121
- I can explain that.
- Explain it to the feds.

411
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:43,783
No, wait a second, Barry.
You can't do that.

412
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:48,558
Okay. Okay, Scudder and I
were involved.

413
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:52,560
But I wanted to get out of that life.
But he's tracked me here.

414
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:57,265
That's why I left last night. I only just
got away from him, and now he's back.

415
00:32:57,442 --> 00:33:01,708
Please, Barry. You gotta protect me
from him. Please?

416
00:33:03,214 --> 00:33:05,774
I don't trust you, Stasia.

417
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:09,643
But Scudder stole something
from a friend of mine at Star Labs...

418
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,584
...and I want it back.

419
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:16,226
So helping me is gonna help you too.
Right?

420
00:33:19,897 --> 00:33:22,798
He's really a cool dude.
I think he'll lend you the money.

421
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:26,027
- What? You want me to do what?
- Be Professor Zoom.

422
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:28,604
You'll pretend to be the guy
who invented the Flash.

423
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:31,765
Oh, come on. Why would
Scudder ever buy that?

424
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:35,344
Because the Flash has a big secret,
which means he's a valuable commodity.

425
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,105
Scudder can't afford to pass it up.

426
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:41,342
So, what we're gonna do is get him to
trade the crystal for the Flash's formula.

427
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:46,278
- It will never work.
- Trust me. Come on.

428
00:33:46,457 --> 00:33:50,086
All right, how are we gonna convince
Scudder that I'm Professor Zoom?

429
00:33:50,261 --> 00:33:54,391
Attitude, baby. Attitude. Now, wait.
Now let's lose these immediately.

430
00:33:54,565 --> 00:33:55,930
Put these on.

431
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,398
Very nice. Where did you get these,
a trash can?

432
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:02,096
Don't be such a baby. Now remember,
you are Professor Zoom.

433
00:34:02,273 --> 00:34:04,833
- I am Professor Zoom.
- Brilliant and unstable.

434
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:07,375
I want you to stay here.
I'm gonna go find Scudder.

435
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,570
Keep an eye on him, please.
Give him a drink.

436
00:34:09,747 --> 00:34:11,772
A kamikaze.

437
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:27,524
You meet me at Central Rail Station tonight.
I'm not gonna last another day here.

438
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:30,929
Now, you don't show,
you can forget about the battery.

439
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:36,665
Oh, and if I play my cards right, I might
just have something else to sell you.

440
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:40,800
Something that sparkles. Be there.

441
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:59,089
- Barry? You see what I mean?
- It is you.

442
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:01,959
- That's a nice 'do, man.
- Act like you don't know me.

443
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:04,533
- That won't be tough.
- Wait, wait. Wait a minute.

444
00:35:04,702 --> 00:35:06,932
Are you undercover,
or is this your secret life?

445
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:11,439
No! If you don't want Garfield to find out
who used the lab for a stag party...

446
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:12,837
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

447
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:15,376
What? You told me Roger
wasn't having a stag party.

448
00:35:15,546 --> 00:35:18,276
He didn't. I wouldn't lie to you.

449
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:22,215
- Come on. We'll meet him in the back.
- Okay.

450
00:35:25,723 --> 00:35:27,281
Back here.

451
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:32,396
- Now remember, be Zoom.
- I am Zoom.

452
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,190
- No, thanks.
- Nothing.

453
00:35:37,101 --> 00:35:40,036
Sometimes it's hard to believe
anything you see.

454
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:43,204
Anything.

455
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,973
These you can believe.

456
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:53,747
So you're Zoom.

457
00:35:55,086 --> 00:36:00,353
- How come I've never heard of you?
- I try to keep a low profile.

458
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:02,652
A man of my talent would be
swamped...

459
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:06,490
...with requests and offers.
I do not like the attention.

460
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:10,725
- And you created the Flash?
- Among other things.

461
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:14,770
You may not know, but I
also invented the video game...

462
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:18,397
...the LaserDisc, the microwave oven,
the digital watch.

463
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:23,013
- Of course, others take credit for...
- Shall we get down to business, please?

464
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,411
I think the three of us
should work together.

465
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:28,711
And just what am I supposed
to bring to this deal?

466
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:35,288
I understand that you have...

467
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:39,054
...the laser crystal that disappeared
from Star Labs.

468
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:42,260
The secrets of the Flash
for the crystal?

469
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,461
Exactly.

470
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:50,372
May I see the crystal?

471
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:55,138
A show of good faith is gonna
require a little more than that.

472
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:57,747
- The battery she sold you.
- Battery?

473
00:36:57,915 --> 00:36:59,542
The battery she sold...

474
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:03,751
- She's played us both for suckers.
- Stop! Central City Police.

475
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:06,219
You're under arrest for dealing
in stolen goods.

476
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:14,160
Snakes! Snakes!

477
00:38:10,921 --> 00:38:14,857
Interesting look, Barry. But aren't you
a few years ahead of yourself on the hair?

478
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:18,484
- Where have you been?
- I went over to Tina's apartment...

479
00:38:18,663 --> 00:38:21,393
...but she wasn't there.
She hasn't been back, has she?

480
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:22,827
No.

481
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:27,567
What an evening. I did well tonight.

482
00:38:27,738 --> 00:38:30,571
These kids are gonna be
very successful.

483
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:34,575
- It doesn't really matter, though.
- It doesn't matter?

484
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:38,412
What difference does it make
if I've ruined my relationship with Tina?

485
00:38:38,582 --> 00:38:41,073
Why don't you just talk to her?

486
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:45,379
Oh, excuse me, Father,
the gallery's closed.

487
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:57,190
Barry!

488
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:03,237
An art gallery is a great front.

489
00:39:03,407 --> 00:39:05,068
And you must be their dealer.

490
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:08,040
Yes, I'm a dealer.

491
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:14,014
- What's this all about?
- English, huh?

492
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:20,488
It's an international operation. Okay,
Your Highness, you're coming with me.

493
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:29,199
Zoom. Or should I say...

494
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,597
...Barry Allen?

495
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:37,132
Now, tell me, what's a cop doing
trafficking in stolen technology?

496
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,639
Let her go. She has nothing
to do with this.

497
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:43,211
Answer a few questions then.
The Flash at my hotel room?

498
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:47,482
- Cooperating with the police.
- And the tricks at the bar?

499
00:39:47,651 --> 00:39:51,883
- Sleight of hand rigged for the sting.
- I think I missed something.

500
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:54,957
- What happened at what bar?
- Let her go, Scudder.

501
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:59,562
Don't be silly. She's Stasia's
European connection.

502
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:03,791
I heard her tell you on the phone the other
night to meet her at Central Station.

503
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:06,903
You think I'm a black marketeer?

504
00:40:07,471 --> 00:40:10,998
- Oh, that's funny.
- The battery at Star Labs West...

505
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:15,703
...Stasia stole it from you.
- And now she's played you for a sap too.

506
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:19,008
She thought she could get her hands
on the battery and the crystal.

507
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:23,679
I think I'll head her off at the station.

508
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:27,414
Imagine her surprise when she sees me
instead of you.

509
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:33,889
Oh, by the way, if you look in the mirror,
you'll see I've left something for you.

510
00:40:34,498 --> 00:40:36,659
The laser couldn't cut through
the crystal...

511
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:41,362
...but it's more than able to cut a nice
clean hole through the two of you.

512
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:44,099
Reflecting the beam is just a flourish.

513
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:47,506
They don't call me the Mirror Master
for nothing.

514
00:40:47,678 --> 00:40:50,545
You've got about
three and a half minutes.

515
00:40:51,882 --> 00:40:53,782
Enjoy them.

516
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:13,100
- Where's Barry? And where's my mother?
- I don't know. Maybe they eloped.

517
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:17,673
With your boyfriend? I'm fed up
with your games. I'm calling the police.

518
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:19,571
Put it down.

519
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:21,377
Now!

520
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:25,705
Now, I want you to sit down
and shut up.

521
00:41:25,883 --> 00:41:29,216
I don't want you to make a move
until I'm out that door. You hear me?

522
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:35,583
- Thanks, doll.
- Wait a second. Wait a second.

523
00:41:35,759 --> 00:41:39,957
You turn me into the cops, you are never
gonna find your mother and Barry.

524
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:43,299
Think about it.

525
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:45,760
Start talking.

526
00:41:46,136 --> 00:41:49,970
I'm supposed to meet my fence
at Central Station to sell him the battery.

527
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:53,166
Scudder's been second-guessing me
ever since I got to this place.

528
00:41:53,477 --> 00:41:57,004
- So maybe he knows about the meet.
- Maybe he doesn't.

529
00:41:57,181 --> 00:42:01,914
I'm the only shot you've got, McGee.
So I suggest we get going.

530
00:42:02,086 --> 00:42:03,951
What do you say?

531
00:42:19,136 --> 00:42:20,933
- What's happening?
- I don't know...

532
00:42:21,105 --> 00:42:23,699
...but I think I'm getting loose.

533
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:33,206
- Does this happen to you a lot?
- Yeah.

534
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:36,478
But usually Tina's around
to help me out.

535
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:38,121
Tina?

536
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:39,756
Yeah.

537
00:42:39,924 --> 00:42:42,188
There's more to your daughter
than you realize.

538
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:45,328
- Yes, I suppose there is.
- Right now, you call the police.

539
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:47,964
I'm headed to Central Station.

540
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:05,146
- Stasia.
- Oh, Fletch, baby.

541
00:43:05,316 --> 00:43:09,150
You don't know how good it is to
see you. Did you bring the money?

542
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,481
- Who's your friend?
- This is Tina.

543
00:43:11,655 --> 00:43:13,350
She's gonna be working with us.

544
00:43:13,524 --> 00:43:15,788
- Show me the battery.
- It belongs to Star Labs.

545
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,951
Now put the briefcase down
and hands up.

546
00:43:18,128 --> 00:43:20,358
Oh, nice move, McGee. Now what?

547
00:43:20,531 --> 00:43:23,022
Now I take the cash and the battery.

548
00:43:24,802 --> 00:43:27,430
I love double jeopardy.
Come on, the battery.

549
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:33,540
Wrong, Scudder.
This is the lightning round.

550
00:43:33,711 --> 00:43:37,670
Yeah? Let's see how well you do
in a crowd.

551
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:06,837
I've had enough of you. All 12 of you.

552
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,926
Here's your crystal. Where's Stasia?

553
00:44:26,096 --> 00:44:28,564
I don't know,
but she's got the money.

554
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:40,472
Baby, I am rid of Scudder at last.

555
00:44:40,644 --> 00:44:43,374
What do you say we just take
this money and run away to...?

556
00:44:43,547 --> 00:44:45,606
Oh, I don't know.
How about Istanbul?

557
00:44:45,783 --> 00:44:48,718
No, I've been there.
How about Mexico?

558
00:44:48,886 --> 00:44:52,344
I hear Leavenworth's lovely
this time of year.

559
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:55,724
Come on, buddy, let's go.
You're coming with us.

560
00:44:55,893 --> 00:44:57,827
Oh, Barry.

561
00:44:57,995 --> 00:45:02,830
How come I always fall
for the right guy at the wrong time?

562
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:05,658
Bad study habits maybe?

563
00:45:05,969 --> 00:45:08,733
All right, lady, you too.
Out of the cab.

564
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:16,244
- Thanks for the lift to the train station.
- Don't be silly.

565
00:45:16,413 --> 00:45:18,108
It's the least I could do.

566
00:45:18,282 --> 00:45:20,807
And really, best of luck
with this group of artists.

567
00:45:20,984 --> 00:45:24,750
You too. Best of luck
with your research.

568
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:29,249
This is idiotic. You're my mother,
for God's sakes.

569
00:45:29,426 --> 00:45:31,451
I don't want to do this anymore.

570
00:45:31,628 --> 00:45:35,086
And don't you run out on me again.
Please.

571
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,792
Oh, sweetie.

572
00:45:38,435 --> 00:45:40,903
I had to leave your father.

573
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:45,641
But leaving you hurt the most.
I never felt part of your life.

574
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:48,567
And when David died, l...

575
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:51,938
I just didn't know what to say.

576
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:54,508
Look, we've got so much to talk about.

577
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:57,085
I need a vacation soon.
We could meet in New York.

578
00:45:57,488 --> 00:45:58,978
I have to go to London...

579
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:04,083
I'll cancel it.

580
00:46:04,695 --> 00:46:06,492
New York would be fabulous.

581
00:46:06,663 --> 00:46:11,293
You know, Mother, you can be
a real pain sometimes. But I love you.

582
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:16,906
I've had it with both of you.

583
00:46:17,074 --> 00:46:21,067
I'm only gonna say this once.
I am freezing in here! So just...

584
00:46:21,245 --> 00:46:24,646
Just stop it with
the cool British reserve, all right?

585
00:46:24,815 --> 00:46:28,410
- You're family, for God's sake.
- He's so American.

586
00:46:28,585 --> 00:46:31,076
Barry, relax. It's all under control.

587
00:46:31,255 --> 00:46:33,450
- It is?
- Don't make me use this.

588
00:46:33,724 --> 00:46:36,989
Oh, not the mime.
Anything but the mime.

589
00:47:48,432 --> 00:47:50,423
