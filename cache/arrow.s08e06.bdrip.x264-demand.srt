1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,314
Previously on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,239
This place looks exactly
like it did when I was 13.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,636
We had planned to come
back here with both of you.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,313
Yeah. That didn't
really work out.

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,197
Because I died.

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,914
Have you come to doubt your
commitment to this mission?

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,991
It might help if I
actually knew why.

8
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,759
The recovery of your universe

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,877
will require a single task.

10
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,037
You must betray Oliver Queen.

11
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,429
If saving it means going back

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,670
to the person that I used to be,

13
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,319
then what the hell is the point?

14
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,231
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,518
Tark drives the lane.

16
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,393
Kicks it to Aldrich in
the corner for three.

17
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,151
Bingo! Count it and the foul.

18
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,150
Ohh.

19
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,550
Comets, who have
stormed all the way back

20
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,393
to tie it up in the
fourth quarter.

21
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,995
No way. It tastes the same.

22
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,117
I'm telling you these Big
Belly Burgers are just better.

23
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,310
I think he's right.

24
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,954
This is pre-Gwespin
Foods merger.

25
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,191
Dad, what are you
still doing here?

26
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,234
How did we get here?

27
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,435
What do you mean?

28
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,116
Uh, I was on a roof
with John and Laurel,

29
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,034
and we were tranged.

30
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,873
Yeah. By Lyla.

31
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,230
Look, Dad said it was all
just a big misunderstanding.

32
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,155
Ahem. What did we do with
Burov's plan for the weapon?

33
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,958
You said we didn't
need it anymore.

34
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,599
Why? The Monitor's
still out there.

35
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,795
He's still a threat.

36
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,190
Dad, are you okay?

37
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,749
You--you look like you
don't remember any of this.

38
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,633
I need to talk to John.

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,718
That should be easy.

40
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,837
He's waiting for you
at that fancy fundraiser.

41
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,190
What fundraiser?

42
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,271
The one you're very late for.

43
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,196
I mean, you do remember
you're Oliver Queen, right?

44
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,913
Hey, Queen,
what's the difference

45
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,798
between a cop and
the Green Arrow?

46
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,151
Cop doesn't need to
play dress-up to do his job.

47
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,273
Ha. Yeah, sure thing. Ohh!

48
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,078
-'m so sorry, Mr. Queen.
-It's fine, it's fine.

49
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,475
There you are, man.

50
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,871
Party started an
hour ago, Oliver.

51
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,754
Do you remember
getting tranged last night?

52
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,432
Yeah. Um, Lyla
feels awful about that.

53
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,270
By the way, that
wasn't last night.

54
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,716
-That was two days
ago. ‘What? No.

55
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,076
No, no. That-- John,
that is the last thing

56
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,992
that I remember before waking up

57
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,798
in my apartment earlier tonight.

58
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,995
You okay, man?

59
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,993
No. This is--this--
is this the--

60
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,150
this is the Monitor.

61
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,513
Oliver. Your wife is working

62
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,994
with the Monitor, John. What--

63
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,275
I thought we
already settled this.

64
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,869
I have been working with the
Monitor but as a double agent,

65
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,678
which I told you on the roof.

66
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,194
I don't--l don't remember that.

67
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,555
I'm not remembering anything.

68
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,949
Oliver, look. Just maybe
you should go home, man,

69
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,555
get a little sleep,
okay, just some rest.

70
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,791
Oliver, there you are. Mayor's
looking for you. Come on.

71
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,755
What?

72
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,471
“What happened there? Oh.

73
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,358
Can't give a speech
with a stained shirt.

74
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,471
Give a s--what speech?
I'm giving a speech?

75
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,870
Very funny. Your joint
remarks with the mayor.

76
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,674
Rene, um, serious question.

77
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,670
When did Palmer
Tech get rebuilt?

78
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,431
You really need to drop
this amnesia routine quick.

79
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,477
This fundraiser is our
only chance to take

80
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,234
the SCPD Vigilante
Pilot Program global.

81
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,994
The mayor needs
you to be on point.

82
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,434
-He's waiting for you. He who?

83
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,153
Isn't--isn't Pollard the mayor?

84
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,794
In her dreams maybe.

85
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,472
What's the matter, Oliver? You
look like you've seen a ghost.

86
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,396
So listen. I was
thinking about making

87
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,834
a few changes to the speech,

88
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,759
so I figured I should
run it by you first.

89
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,510
This is not possible. This is...

90
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,192
What? Don't tell
me you're scared

91
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,998
of a little last-minute
memorization, Oliver.

92
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,433
It's been a while
since I've seen you.

93
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,879
Couple of days maybe. You're
looking at me like it's been years.

94
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,229
No. You're right. A couple days.

95
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,757
Right. So listen. I was thinking

96
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,672
about adding a line
about, you know,

97
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,036
me telling you it was
a bad idea to unmask,

98
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,316
but, you know, maybe
a joke about how

99
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,595
you'd rather take it to supermax

100
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,750
than take my advice.

101
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,433
Heh. You know?
What do you think?

102
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,553
You know that I
went to Slabside?

103
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,234
Uh...yeah. What's that,

104
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,913
your way of saying I should
have come visit more often?

105
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,317
Quentin, right before
I turned myself in...

106
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,358
Diaz shot you, right?

107
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,510
Oh. Yeah.

108
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,113
That son of a bitch
almost killed me.

109
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,472
Almost died in the O.R.
You don't remember?

110
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,918
I remember it differently.

111
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,792
Well, the doctors
called it a miracle.

112
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,280
I was without
oxygen for so long,

113
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,834
I should have
been six feet under.

114
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,555
Felt like I escaped
my fate or something.

115
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,632
Hey. There's something
you need to see.

116
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,071
So...there's a hostage
situation at the SCPD.

117
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,878
The leader's demanding
to meet with the mayor.

118
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,070
No. You can't go down there.

119
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,799
We'll call in a
special-ops team.

120
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,879
I'm the mayor, Nobody
does my dirty work for me.

121
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,269
Give my apologies to the guests.

122
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,113
I'm--I'm gonna come with you.

123
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,237
Okay, but you might want
to bring a change of clothes

124
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,237
because something tells me
we're gonna need the green guy.

125
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,112
Get the feds on the line.
Tell them I need backup

126
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,600
-here now, right now.
-Yes, ma'am.

127
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,830
What's the situation, Captain?

128
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,479
Armed mercs stormed my precinct,

129
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,711
took a dozen of my guys hostage.

130
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,274
How did they get by your men?

131
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,636
It's a long story that I
don't have time to tell.

132
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,958
The only demand was
to speak to the mayor.

133
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,275
All right. Well,
I'll go talk to them.

134
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,434
I appreciate that,
but there is no way

135
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,635
I'm sending you in there.

136
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,359
Listen. I wore the
blues along time

137
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,715
before I wore this
monkey suit, okay?

138
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,479
- can hold my own.
-l know, sir.

139
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,789
It's not the point.

140
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,229
She's right. It's too risky.

141
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,915
Says the man who risks
his life every day for this city?

142
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,718
Give me a vest. I'l go in there,

143
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,870
I'll distract the
son of a bitch,

144
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,519
and in the meantime,
you sneak around the back

145
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,755
and do your thing, okay?

146
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,989
The longer this drags on,

147
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,594
the worse it gets.

148
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,749
Let me do this.

149
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,075
I'll have his back.

150
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,717
I want you on
comms the whole time.

151
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,910
Sure.

152
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,749
All units, be advised

153
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,194
Mayor Lance is
entering the building.

154
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,271
I repeat Mayor Lance
is entering the building.

155
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,793
This is Mayor Quentin Lance.

156
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,434
I'm unarmed. I'm coming in.

157
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,879
-That's far enough.
-All right.

158
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,633
Just--just take it easy, okay?

159
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,150
Take it easy.

160
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,797
I'm in position.
Keep him talking.

161
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,598
You asked for me. Here I am.

162
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,715
What do you want
to talk about with me?

163
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,995
You're the Mayor. You're a guy

164
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,230
who can make things happen.

165
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,716
Why don't you let a few of
these guys go while we talk?

166
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,359
So I can get
stormed by the cops?

167
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,079
No, thanks. I'm not stupid.

168
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,430
But it would show that you
don't want anybody to get hurt

169
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,829
because if anybody gets hurt,

170
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,035
you're in real trouble.

171
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,038
Actually, I think you're
already in trouble.

172
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,560
I'm the one holding the gun.

173
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,631
Not for long. Put it down.

174
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,674
Agh. Err.

175
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,390
This...is...over.

176
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,631
This isn't over until
you stop it, Oliver.

177
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,194
That's the only way out.

178
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,789
What are you talking about?

179
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,469
-No! Quentin!

180
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,475
Ahh!

181
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,274
Tark drives the lane.

182
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,238
Kicks it to Aldrich in
the corner for three.

183
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,518
Bingo! Count it and the foul.

184
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,038
That's an 8-0 run by the Comets,

185
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,793
who have stormed
all the way back

186
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,678
to tie it up in the
fourth quarter.

187
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,993
88 apiece. What a
comeback for the Comets,

188
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,634
and there's a timeout...

189
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,191
No way. It tastes the same.

190
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,237
I'm telling you this Big
Belly Burger's just better.

191
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,390
I think he's right.

192
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,994
This is pre-Gwespin
Foods merger.

193
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,431
Ooh, Dad. What are
you still doing here?

194
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,394
I'm late for a fundraiser.

195
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,920
Yeah. Really late.

196
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,710
You want a burger? Those
things never have good food.

197
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,315
Did something happen at
the SCPD headquarters?

198
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,039
Like what?

199
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,230
Never mind.

200
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,230
Hey, Queen.
What's the difference

201
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,118
between a cop and
the Green Arrow?

202
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,796
Cop doesn't need to
play dress-up to do his job.

203
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,640
Ooh! Nice reflexes,
Mr. Queen. ~Thank you.

204
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,798
There you are. You know the
party started an hour ago, right?

205
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,235
I need to speak with you.

206
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,834
Uh, this is gonna sound crazy.

207
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,595
Um... have been here
before. So have you.

208
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,110
What are you talking about?

209
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,873
About the Monitor dropping
me into some sort of

210
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,839
alternate reality t-time
loop or something,

211
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,116
where everything is different,
where Lance is still alive.

212
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,789
Oliver, Lance has
always been alive.

213
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,110
No, he hasn't. You
just don't remember

214
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,550
because the Monitor has done
something to people's memories,

215
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,438
but I--1 think I know
the way out of this,

216
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,991
but I--I need to stop
a bomb at the SCPD.

217
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,231
Oliver, will you just
calm down, man?

218
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,630
If there was a bomb,
we would know about it.

219
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,109
Lyla would know about it.

220
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,350
Lyla's a part of this.

221
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,510
Part of what?

222
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,229
Oliver seems to
think that he's caught

223
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,390
in some sort of time loop.

224
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,710
If we're traveling back in time,

225
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,075
I'd like to revisit my 20s.

226
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,674
I--I need to speak with Quentin,

227
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,877
The mayor's waiting for me.

228
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,355
Yeah. How'd you know?

229
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,875
Mr. Mayor.

230
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,399
Oh. Hey, Oliver. Listen.

231
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,359
I, uh--l made a few last-minute
changes to the speech, so--

232
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,114
“We need to talk. -Sure. Let's.

233
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,280
Uh, yeah. I wanted to run
these changes by you anyway.

234
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,037
You want to add a
joke about Slabside,

235
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,231
about how I would
rather spend time

236
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,789
in a supermax than
take your advice.

237
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,237
You steal a copy of my
speech or something?

238
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,117
We've had this exact
conversation already.

239
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,350
What are you talking about?

240
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,197
Fully aware of how
this is going to sound.

241
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,679
Quentin, I am trapped in
some sort of...time loop,

242
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,078
where the same events just
keep repeating themselves.

243
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,838
-Like "Groundhog Day." Sure,

244
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,640
except this one ends
in a lot of people dead,

245
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,474
including the two of us.

246
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,909
Okay. How can I help?

247
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,514
Do you actually believe me?

248
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,474
Oliver, I've seen
one daughter die

249
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,393
and come back to life twice.

250
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,312
I've seen another come
from some other Earth.

251
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,552
I've seen a guy in red run
so fast he can reverse time.

252
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,280
This is not exactly
outside the norm, is it?

253
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,273
Also, I'm done learning my
lesson about doubting you

254
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,795
because that always
bites me in the ass. Heh.

255
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,070
What happens now?

256
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,317
Very shortly, we
are gonna learn that

257
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,949
there is a hostage
situation at the SCPD.

258
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,430
They're going to insist that
they talk to you and only you.

259
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,749
And how does it go south?

260
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,191
There's a hidden
explosive device

261
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,550
that I didn't know about
the first time through,

262
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,758
and judging from the blast,
it's underneath the building.

263
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,150
-Eh. So you find it. Yeah.

264
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,310
You keep us from going boom,

265
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,198
What then?
- break out of the loop.

266
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,510
Great.

267
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,949
Here you are. There's
something you need to see.

268
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,350
Get the feds on the line.

269
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,113
-Tell them I need backup now.
-Yes, ma'am.

270
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,395
What's the situation, Captain?

271
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,914
Armed mercs
stormed the precinct,

272
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,070
took a dozen of my guys hostage.

273
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,670
They have a bomb.

274
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,998
We already did a sweep
of the entire building.

275
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,719
It's not in the building.
It's underneath it.

276
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,919
How could you
possibly know that?

277
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,151
I trust him. Instinct thing.

278
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,315
So what do you want to do?

279
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,159
This is Mayor Quentin Lance.

280
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,514
I'm unarmed. I'm coming in.

281
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,193
Stop right there.

282
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,072
Oh. It's you. Would you relax?

283
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,072
We are both here
for the same thing.

284
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,992
Hey. How did you know
to come down here?

285
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,310
I may have learned
about the existence

286
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,551
of this place as a
part of a former career.

287
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,629
How did you know about the bomb?

288
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,552
You wouldn't believe
me if I told you.

289
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,476
Well, actually, since you're
not going to remember anyway,

290
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,429
there is a crazy space god who
has me trapped in a time loop.

291
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,034
Yeah? Me, too.

292
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,752
It's my second time through.
-Same.

293
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,758
- wake up in the bunker.
-I wake up in my apartment,

294
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,433
so clearly, the
Monitor is doing this.

295
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,159
-You mean punishing us? Yeah.

296
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:54,719
We are the two people who have
royally pissed him off the most.

297
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,791
In Russia, I disobeyed him,

298
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,399
and you--you
tried to destroy him.

299
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,949
At least we're in
it together now.

300
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,838
I think disarming that
is the way out of here.

301
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,478
How long do you think
until this thing goes boom?

302
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,359
Oh. Your guess
is as good as mine.

303
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,238
Quentin's upstairs
buying us some time.

304
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,598
-Quentin--he's here?
-Yeah.

305
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,997
I think we just activated
some kind of failsafe.

306
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,639
Look. We need more time
on the next loop, Laurel.

307
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,438
It would probably help if we
found each other faster next time.

308
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,590
There's a party at the
Palmer Tech building.

309
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,159
Meet me there, -Are we
talking formal wear or--

310
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,475
Tark drives the lane.

311
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,751
Kicks it to Aldrich in
the corner for three.

312
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,910
Bingo!

313
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,071
No way. It's the same.

314
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,072
I'm telling you. This Big
Belly Burger is just better.

315
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,275
Guess you realized you're late.

316
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,430
Something like that.

317
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,155
Hey, Queen.
What's the difference

318
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,310
between a cop and
the Green Arrow?

319
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,153
Cop doesn't need to
play dress-up to do his job.

320
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,310
Sorry.

321
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,715
Mr. Mayor?

322
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,430
Hey, Oliver. Listen. I made a few
last-minute changes to the speech.

323
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,835
And you figured you
should run them by me first.

324
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,035
Yeah, exactly.

325
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,589
Hey, baby girl.

326
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,031
1 didn't think you
were gonna make it.

327
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,795
Me either.

328
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,994
You okay, honey?

329
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,039
I'm just really
happy to see you.

330
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,390
Oh. I'm happy to see you, too.

331
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,789
Though I got to
say I'm glad you left

332
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,950
the black lipstick
at home tonight.

333
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,879
You know that
I'm Earth-2 Laurel.

334
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,190
Who else would you be?

335
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,634
Look. I'm really
sorry to interrupt,

336
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,199
but you and I need to go.

337
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,919
You're coming with
us. We need your help.

338
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,115
What do you mean there's a bomb?

339
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,191
I know how to stop it,
but you have to trust me.

340
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,395
I'm gonna need a vest.

341
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,835
Not this time, Quentin.

342
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,754
This is Mayor Quentin Lance.

343
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,079
You wanted to talk. Let's talk.

344
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,760
The detonator operates
on an oscillating frequency.

345
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,309
If we can find the right one,
we should be able to disrupt it.

346
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,670
Vincent, listen to me.

347
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,549
I know you don't
really want to do this.

348
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,199
And I know that if
you don't get in here

349
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,919
these men are gonna die.

350
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,035
I have an idea.

351
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,470
We did it.

352
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,034
Okay. Fine. You did it.

353
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,997
We stopped the bomb. What
the hell are we still doing here?

354
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,275
I don't----

355
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,274
we must have missed something.

356
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,040
No!

357
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,833
No! No!

358
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,313
Tark drives the lane.

359
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,193
Kicks it to Aldrich in
the corner for three.

360
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,390
Bingo!

361
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,757
Lovely to have you
here this evening.

362
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,555
Thanks for coming out.

363
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,117
All right. Quentin's
death is the reset point,

364
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,315
which means that

365
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,719
saving him must be the key.

366
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,918
What kind of sick game
is the Monitor playing?

367
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,479
I don't know. We
need to find out

368
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,438
who is behind this
hostage situation.

369
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,160
If it's just about killing
Quentin, then why plant a bomb?

370
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,879
It seems like a
lot of extra work.

371
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,394
Maybe whoever
is behind this wants

372
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,834
their involvement kept a secret.

373
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,310
Do you really think there's
a larger conspiracy here?

374
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,959
Those were mercenaries, Laurel,

375
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,952
which means that
somebody had to hire them.

376
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,112
Great, and I'm sure they're
gonna be really easy to find, too.

377
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,509
Any idea where to start?

378
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,310
Let's get Quentin out of here.

379
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,515
Why don't you take
him to the bunker?

380
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,515
What about you?

381
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,313
I'm gonna go take
a look at that bomb.

382
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,159
Laurel, I didn't think
you'd make it tonight.

383
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,197
Iam really not in the
mood for small talk

384
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,395
with the Monitor's bestie.

385
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,392
Excuse me.
-It turns out tranq darts,

386
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,870
they don't feel so good.

387
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,680
1 told you that was a
big misunderstanding.

388
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,150
Well, understand this.
The second I get out

389
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,436
of this sadistic "Edge
of Tomorrow" reboot,

390
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,869
I am going to make
sure to tell everyone

391
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,509
exactly what kind of
traitor you really are.

392
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,274
Laurel, I truly have no idea
what you're talking about,

393
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,392
but whatever it is
you're feeling toward me,

394
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,550
that's on you.

395
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,110
Thank you for the
advice, Dr. Phil,

396
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,120
and now here's some for you.

397
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,231
The next time you decide
to double-cross someone,

398
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,755
don't pick a woman who
specializes in revenge.

399
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,349
You're threatening me.

400
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,959
Yes. Yes, I am, but don't worry.

401
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,235
You won't remember anyway,

402
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:10,038
and by the way, I pull off the
short hair way better than you do.

403
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,555
What are you doing here?

404
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,834
Well, word came down that the
Green Arrow called in a bomb threat,

405
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,519
so I thought to myself,
"How did he know about that,

406
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,670
and why didn't he call me?"

407
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,672
Because the Monitor has
me trapped in a time loop.

408
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,470
Already told you that.

409
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,917
Okay. Definitely not the
answer I was expecting,

410
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,556
but if the Monitor's
involved, anything is possible.

411
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,949
Any idea how to break out?

412
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,154
I have to save Quentin's life.

413
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,679
I thought that this
was the key to it,

414
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,239
but I'm not finding anything.

415
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,630
Well, has to be something.
No case is unsolvable.

416
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,069
This might be impossible.

417
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,270
Well, you'll figure it out.

418
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,958
I do wish I was
as sure as you are.

419
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,474
You want to know
what makes me so sure?

420
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,790
Huh? “You.

421
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,551
You, Oliver. You
always figure it out.

422
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,910
You never stop fighting.
You never give up.

423
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,195
You always keep at it.

424
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,239
Why should this
be any different?

425
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,913
Whatever version this is of you,

426
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,833
you still give the best advice.

427
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,158
Yeah. I'm flattered.
Well, AR.G.US. has

428
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,670
some more sophisticated
analytical equipment.

429
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,439
Any chance you
can get me in there?

430
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,919
Yeah. I bet I can
make a few calls.

431
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,631
So you're telling me we're in
some kind of a alternate reality

432
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,996
based on the plot of
a Bill Murray movie?

433
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,352
Well, I was gonna go with a
Tom Cruise flick but basically.

434
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,914
Also just really glad
that you believe me.

435
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,032
Well, it's not the craziest
thing you ever told me.

436
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,554
I mean, I'm just
glad this Monitor guy

437
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,875
just kept me as mayor, you know?

438
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,758
What is it? What's that look?

439
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:51,315
It--it's just that,
uh, in my world

440
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,071
or in the real world, uh,
you're not mayor anymore.

441
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,079
Really? Pollard.

442
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,237
She always had it in for me.

443
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,150
There something else?

444
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,031
Laurel. Sweetheart, I
always know when you're

445
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,190
hiding something from me.

446
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,475
Please tell me. What is it?

447
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,438
It--it's a year and a half ago

448
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,591
when Diaz-- when he shot you

449
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,235
in--in the real
reality or whatever,

450
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,471
you--you didn't exactly, um--

451
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,634
1 didn't recover.

452
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,910
No. No. You died to save me.

453
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,599
Best way I could have gone.

454
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,235
What?! I'm sorry.
I basically just

455
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,358
told you you're a ghost, and
you're completely okay with that?

456
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,796
It doesn't--it doesn't faze
you? You're completely calm?

457
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,236
I always felt like I cheated
death with that one.

458
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,193
Guess that's because I didn't.

459
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,678
Fate's just tricky like that.

460
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,033
-It's Oliver. Yeah?

461
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,158
He figure out who wants me dead?

462
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,880
Not yet, but he did
figure out the location

463
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,030
of the mercs' hideout.

464
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,316
Okay. So we better go.

465
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,709
How'd you find this place?

466
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,873
Uh, we analyzed the bomb

467
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,640
and traced the chemical
signature back to this building.

468
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,120
Interesting.

469
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,230
What?
-Your mouth but Felicity's words.

470
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,029
It still doesn't tell us
who hired these bozos.

471
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,194
Maybe this will help.

472
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,790
Bomb!

473
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,357
Uh, w-what the
hell are you doing?

474
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,591
Helping you. You're
missing the point, Oliver.

475
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,473
What? -You can't fight this.

476
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,110
Ugh.

477
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,190
Lyla!

478
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,239
Tark drives the lane.

479
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,033
Kicks it to Aldrich in
the corner for three.

480
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,433
Bingo! Count it and the foul.

481
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,551
No sign of Lyla anywhere. You?

482
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,515
John just told me
she got called away

483
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,829
on a last-minute
AR.G.U.S. mission,

484
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,190
meaning she's
never even been here.

485
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,075
Maybe the Monitor
deleted her for going rogue.

486
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,754
Wouldn't that be so, so sad?

487
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,871
She's clearly helping him.
There's no reason for her

488
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,155
to switch sides right now.

489
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,311
So why reveal her
hand? It makes no sense.

490
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,675
All right. You spoke with her.

491
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,433
Was there anything,

492
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,517
anything at all in the
conversation that stood out?

493
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,069
She said how I feel
towards her was on me.

494
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,596
Like it's my fault
that I'm stuck here.

495
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,554
1 told you the
Monitor's punishing us.

496
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,830
I'm not so sure.

497
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,879
We've had to watch Quentin
die over and over again,

498
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,519
and we can't save him.

499
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,673
If had to design
hell, this would be it.

500
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,672
But right before
Lyla disappeared,

501
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,556
she told me she
was trying to help me.

502
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,314
She also told you
you can't fight this.

503
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,954
It seems pretty clear to me
that we're not supposed to win.

504
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,952
The first time that
I met Mar Novu,

505
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,960
it felt--it felt the same.

506
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,396
It was like I was put in a situation
where there was no way out,

507
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,153
but it was a test, Laurel.

508
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,789
It was a test just
like I think that this is.

509
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,633
-A test of what?
-l don't know,

510
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,518
but there is a way out of here,

511
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,230
and I'm gonna find it.

512
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,438
-You just never give up, do you?
-No, I don't.

513
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,195
Are you with me?

514
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,950
Fine.

515
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,270
What's our play?

516
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,114
We go back to
the mercs' hideout.

517
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,554
We know where the
danger is this time,

518
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,199
so we can do things differently.

519
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,593
You grab Quentin,
and I'll meet you there.

520
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,830
Okay.

521
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,390
So you're telling me
we've been here once

522
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,119
and still came back for more?

523
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,835
At least now we
know what not to do.

524
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,070
Okay.

525
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,111
All right. That should
disable the bomb.

526
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,078
Well, I certainly hope
so because I am getting

527
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,992
sick and tired of
getting blown up.

528
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,873
- All right.
- Okay. So now what?

529
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,396
We find out who hired
those mercs to kill you.

530
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,950
Money leads to a man
named Anderson White.

531
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,310
Never heard of him.

532
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,675
Looks like he's been accused

533
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,035
of not too many nice things--

534
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,757
money laundering, racketeering.

535
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,037
Doesn't explain why
he'd want me dead.

536
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,395
Well, that's what
we're gonna find out.

537
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,914
CEO of a company
named Global Solutions.

538
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,400
They have a warehouse
down by the docks.

539
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,550
Let's go.

540
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,034
We need to find White.

541
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,230
Back this way!

542
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,151
- Come on, come on.
- I got you. I got you.

543
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,634
I'll take care of the rest.

544
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,118
Err! Ugh.

545
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,634
Oh, I'm sorry, baby girl.

546
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,599
Looks like we lost this round.

547
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,754
No. No! I am not
letting you die again.

548
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,674
t's too late. «No.

549
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,478
It--it's-it's time
to say good-bye.

550
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,073
I'm not giving up
on you, Quentin.

551
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,151
Quentin, I am not
giving up on you.

552
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,199
You never gave up on me.

553
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,836
You believed in me
when nobody else did.

554
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,709
Well, that's what
dads do. They believe.

555
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,639
I want you to know

556
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,189
that you are the reason
that I'm trying to be a hero.

557
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,679
It's because of you.

558
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,913
Sweetheart... you are a hero.

559
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,670
You are.

560
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,029
Thank you.

561
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,109
Thank you. I never had
the chance to tell you

562
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,873
how much you mean to me.

563
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,354
Well... ~Thank you.

564
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,233
I think you just did.

565
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,950
I'love you. I love you.

566
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,879
Good-bye.

567
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,675
Damn it.

568
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,994
All right. Okay.
All right, Laurel.

569
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,197
We fix this next
time. We'll fix it.

570
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,237
I can't do this again.

571
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,229
I'm done, Oliver.

572
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,354
All I have ever
wanted was a chance

573
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,880
to say good-bye to Quentin.

574
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,079
Now I have.

575
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,440
Tark drives the lane.

576
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,638
Kicks it to Aldrich in
the corner for three.

577
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,396
Bingo! Count it and the foul.

578
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,635
Laurel?

579
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,354
Laurel!

580
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,475
She's not here.

581
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,199
“Where is she? Gone.

582
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,192
What did you--what
did you do, Lyla?

583
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,795
I didn't do anything. Laurel
got what she needed from this.

584
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,314
I don't have time for
these games, Lyla,

585
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,273
so whatever this is, get
me out of here right now!

586
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,515
I can't do that, Oliver.

587
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,353
Mar Novu needs you to understand

588
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,158
no good will come from struggle.

589
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,079
The only way to win is
to accept the inevitable.

590
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,237
I have no idea what that means.

591
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,789
Learn that, and this will end.

592
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,590
Lyla!

593
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,878
So if me dying is the problem,

594
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,156
maybe bringing me into
the lion's den isn't so smart.

595
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,993
Couldn't think of a better
way to keep you safe.

596
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,430
Yeah. That makes sense.

597
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,950
Huh!

598
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,430
Ah-ah-ah-ah, Unless
you want a hole for a head.

599
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,039
Are you Anderson White?

600
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,399
You really think
Mr. White would be here?

601
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,437
He ordered a hit
on my friend. Why?

602
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,674
I guess the clock's ticking.

603
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,635
Looks like a list of hits.

604
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,518
And clients. Coded
and anonymous.

605
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,034
White's just the middleman.

606
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,032
A CEO with a healthy
side business brokering

607
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,599
hits for wealthy asshats,

608
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,955
All right. We're
back to square one.

609
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,838
We have no idea how
deep this rabbit hole goes.

610
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,115
We got to get going.

611
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,430
Unh!

612
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,913
Get down! Get down!

613
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,394
Hey. You okay?
You all right? Okay.

614
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,714
Come on. Come on.

615
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,875
Come on.

616
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,718
Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay.

617
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,315
Whoa!

618
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,032
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

619
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,475
Aah!

620
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,913
Get them. -Go, go, go.

621
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,159
Let's go. Come on.

622
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,999
Get down, get down!

623
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,355
Over there!

624
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,600
Down, Quentin!

625
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,077
Ohh. Oh, it's the last one.

626
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,393
How many arrows you got left?

627
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,509
Not enough.

628
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,478
Oh, boy. Aren't we the couple?

629
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,150
We are gonna find
a way out of this.

630
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,958
There has to be a way to fix it,

631
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,475
and we are gonna
find it, Quentin.

632
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,313
It doesn't matter how many
times. We're gonna find it!

633
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,630
Yeah? Sure. What's it gonna be,

634
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,438
60 times, 100 times?

635
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,433
It's gonna be however
many times it takes!

636
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,958
You know, getting
hunted like this

637
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,279
in a space like
this is kind of like

638
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,272
what I was doing to
you all those years ago.

639
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,635
Remember?

640
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,600
Sort of makes sense I'd go
out like this now, don't you think?

641
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,273
Would you please
just save your strength?

642
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,194
For what?

643
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,596
Oliver, you take
care of these guys,

644
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,795
there'll be more behind them,

645
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,950
there will be more behind them.

646
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,958
There is no saving me from this!

647
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:58,037
Okay? You ever
think that's the point?

648
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,753
Maybe you're not supposed to.

649
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,314
I'm not giving up...

650
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,318
and you're not giving up either.

651
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,831
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm not giving up.

652
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,753
Maybe I'm giving in.

653
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,640
You see, I've been outrunning
death for a while now.

654
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:21,149
The siege, the island,

655
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,274
but when Diaz shot
me, that felt different

656
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,349
like I was finally at the end,

657
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,153
and I made my peace with that.

658
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,874
And maybe it's
time you did, too.

659
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,798
It looks like fate's knocking.

660
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,718
You just get ready to move.

661
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,919
I'll see you on the
other side, Oliver.

662
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,710
Quentin,

663
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,034
Tark drives the lane.

664
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,197
Kicks it to Aldrich in
the corner for three.

665
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,398
Bingo! Count it and the foul.

666
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,398
That's an 8-0 run by the Comets,

667
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,637
who have stormed all the
way back fo tie it up here

668
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,790
in the fourth quarter.

669
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,155
88 apiece.

670
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,879
What a comeback for the Comets,

671
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,030
and there's a timeout.

672
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,669
No way. It tastes the same.

673
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,200
Dad, what are you
still doing here?

674
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,398
Hey, guys. I'm just
heading out the door.

675
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,989
Wanted to let you
know, all of you know

676
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:27,040
what a--just what a gift

677
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,152
getting to know
you all has been.

678
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,909
Dad, you're going
to a fundraiser.

679
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,635
It's not like you're
going into war.

680
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,310
Although I guess I
can see the similarities.

681
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,838
I think he's talking
about Crisis.

682
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,117
I'm just really proud
of all you guys.

683
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,550
I'm really proud.

684
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,670
1 got to go.

685
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,715
Dad...

686
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,629
you're gonna be fine.

687
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,555
So are you,

688
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,870
All of you will be

689
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,994
whatever happens.

690
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,754
Hey, Queen.
What's the difference

691
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,514
between a cop--hey!

692
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,230
Yeah. Lovely.

693
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,549
Quentin, excuse me.

694
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,470
Hey.

695
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,835
What's the matter, Oliver?

696
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,514
You look like
you've seen a ghost.

697
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,910
Maybe I did.

698
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,958
May I speak with
you for a second?

699
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,310
Sure.

700
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,752
Uh, yeah, you want
to go over the speech?

701
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,594
‘Cause I was thinking
about adding a few lines.

702
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:50,675
I have a question for you.

703
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:51,990
Sure.

704
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,390
Back when I was running
around as the Hood,

705
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,630
you were trying to arrest me.

706
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,473
You remember that?

707
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,950
Ah. Yeah. The good old days.

708
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,594
How could I ever forget?

709
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,479
The question is...

710
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,791
what made you
decide that I wasn't

711
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,639
your enemy anymore?

712
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,919
What changed your mind?

713
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,039
Huh. Oh, you know,
my daughters for one.

714
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,875
Because I didn't raise dummies,

715
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,189
and, uh, you know, if
they were okay with you,

716
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,749
then I figured I should be, too.

717
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,991
-Yeah, -They trusted me,

718
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,430
and you trusted them.

719
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,034
Yeah. They got me to
listen to what I always knew

720
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,157
in my gut, that we
were on the same side

721
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,033
and fighting for the same goal,

722
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:42,631
and it just took me
a while to get there.

723
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,790
Sorry.

724
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,510
It's okay.

725
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,119
Oliver, is there any
particular reason

726
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,475
for this trip down memory lane?

727
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,430
Yeah.

728
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,317
God, I've been hanging
on to something.

729
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,477
Someone told me
just recently that, uh...

730
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,998
it's about time I
made peace with it.

731
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:12,317
Okay. Sounds like
a smart someone.

732
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,630
Yeah.

733
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,555
Oh, I shouldn't have to
say good-bye to you again.

734
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,350
Good-bye?

735
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,119
Evening's just getting started.

736
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,470
Yeah.

737
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,351
Thank you, Quentin
for everything.

738
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,230
Mr. Mayor.

739
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,313
We're gonna see each
other again, Oliver.

740
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,470
Mr. Mayor!

741
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,879
Hostage situation.

742
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,514
I hope so.

743
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,119
Congratulations, Oliver.

744
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,314
Now you understand.

745
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,952
I couldn't change
Quentin's fate.

746
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,391
I can't change
mine either, can I?

747
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,749
No. I'm sorry.

748
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:42,198
Why did the Monitor go
to all of this trouble just to...

749
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,514
just to prove a point?

750
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,034
You've always been
aman who needed to

751
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,594
see things for himself,

752
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,079
Telling you wouldn't
have been enough.

753
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,074
How long have
you worked for him?

754
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,710
Awhile.

755
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,349
You lied to us, Lyla.

756
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,794
You...

757
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,349
you lied to John.

758
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,669
Keeping this from John has been

759
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,154
the hardest thing
I've ever had to do.

760
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,310
Then why do it?

761
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:10,040
The same reason
you left Felicity and Mia

762
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,079
in that cabin-- to
protect my family.

763
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,197
Do you honestly
believe that working

764
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,079
with the Monitor is
the best way to do that?

765
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,514
It's the only way.

766
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,479
The Crisis is coming.
There is no stopping it.

767
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,711
All we can do is
try to survive it.

768
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,075
Okay, help me out here, Lyla.

769
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,794
1 don't even know what it is.

770
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:32,914
I know, but you will...soon.

771
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,554
What I can tell you

772
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,518
is there is an evil
coming that is greater

773
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,591
than anything we've
ever had to face.

774
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,869
Can we stop it?

775
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,590
I don't know...

776
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,357
but you are the only
chance we have.

777
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,513
So everything I've done

778
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,474
from the moment
I left that cabin,

779
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,512
this has all been some...

780
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,433
bigger part of a test?

781
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,751
He needed to be
sure you were ready.

782
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,639
He's just been sending
me on useless missions.

783
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,189
They weren't useless.

784
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,510
The dwarf star
particles, Dr. Wong,

785
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,393
even the antimatter weapon,

786
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,994
they all have a purpose,

787
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,271
just not the one
you were expecting.

788
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,797
Why did he involve my children?

789
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,474
Time is a gift.

790
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,790
What now?

791
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,038
You complete your final mission.

792
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,669
I'll see you there.

793
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,630
Ohh.

794
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,549
Where are we?

795
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:07,950
You okay?

796
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,080
I have a killer headache.

797
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,714
The last thing that I
remember is Quentin...

798
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,478
dying in that warehouse.

799
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,553
I was wearing these on the roof

800
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,917
when we got ranged,
so does that mean that

801
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,030
We got out.

802
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,870
How?

803
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,589
We learned our lessons.

804
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,596
I got out after I said good-bye.

805
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,551
Why would the Monitor let
me see Quentin one last time?

806
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:41,080
It was a reward for
not betraying me.

807
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,196
Didn't really think
rewards were his brand.

808
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:47,637
No. We were wrong about him.

809
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,914
And Lyla was right?

810
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,799
That's annoying.

811
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,791
So why did you have
to learn to let Lance go?

812
00:40:56,080 --> 00:41:00,074
Because deep
down, I still believed

813
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,231
that I could fight my fate.

814
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,633
Now I know I can't.

815
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,676
Lyla said we had
one last thing to do,

816
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,553
one final mission.

817
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,276
I can't wait to find
out what that is.

818
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,399
Where that is.

819
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,993
We're not in Star City.

820
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,510
Dad.

821
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,675
You okay?

822
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,274
Where the hell are we?

823
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,950
We're on Lian Yu.

824
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,873
Greg, move your head!
