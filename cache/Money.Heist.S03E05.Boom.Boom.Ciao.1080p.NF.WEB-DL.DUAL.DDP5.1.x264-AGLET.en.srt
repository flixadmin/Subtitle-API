1
00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:24,125
Good God!

2
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:32,916
No, it's not going down.
Give me another one. Another!

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,833
- Come on!
- Another!

4
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:36,000
Another shot!

5
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:48,958
Please, please, please.

6
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:50,416
What's happening?

7
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,125
Okay, that's it.

8
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:00,458
That's it, that's it.

9
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,291
How long?

10
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:07,500
Five seconds.

11
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:18,875
Doors are unlocked.
Everyone, get ready. Come on!

12
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:24,125
Get ready!
You need to put on your mask, now!

13
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:44,958
Ready! Now!

14
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,375
Quiet!

15
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:08,500
Be quiet, fuck!

16
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:10,083
It's only smoke.

17
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:15,916
Don't do it yet. Hold on.

18
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:21,083
Helicopters, I need you ready
in 30 seconds.

19
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:32,666
Now! Everyone outside. Let's go!

20
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,375
Out! Now. Quick. Everybody out.

21
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:37,708
Come on, come on, come on. Get out.

22
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,791
Everybody out, let's go.
Move, move, move!

23
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:44,000
Get out! Come on!

24
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,666
Come on, come on! Outside!

25
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,625
Move it!

26
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:05,541
What the fuck?

27
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:06,833
Son of a bitch.

28
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:08,166
We have to abort.

29
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,625
I don't give a shit about the balconies.

30
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,125
If the hostages are there,
we knock down the main door.

31
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:16,041
Armored unit, advance now!

32
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:50,416
Let's go, let's go! Tie poles to the door.

33
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,041
I'm gonna open the door and you go out
holding up these boxes.

34
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:55,416
Is that right, little orphan?

35
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:58,333
Motherfucker.

36
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:05,791
They're opening the doors.

37
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:08,875
That's better. Everybody go in. Now!

38
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:16,416
Get out there now.

39
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,041
Nobody is moving.

40
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:19,625
I said get the fuck out there!

41
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:23,208
Special forces are about to arrive.
No one move.

42
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:39,500
What are you gonna do?

43
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,541
Are you gonna shoot us,
like we shot your papa?

44
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:47,583
Don't move!

45
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:50,250
Denver! Denver, what are you doing?

46
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:51,416
Denver!

47
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:53,250
Denver!

48
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:54,708
Denver, stop!

49
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,666
And here's the beauty of the surprise.
It's just like you're thinking.

50
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:02,666
We surrender!

51
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,125
We surrender!

52
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,333
We surrender!

53
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:07,875
What?

54
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:09,833
PROFESSOR: What's he doing?

55
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:11,750
What's he doing?

56
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,333
We surrender!

57
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,375
We surrender!

58
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:18,875
Target in sight.

59
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,458
Denver!

60
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:38,125
I have a shot at him.
Target in the crosshairs.

61
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:40,208
Requesting permission to fire, sir.

62
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:44,333
Permission to shoot.
I repeat, permission to shoot.

63
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:49,750
<i>The state will permit you</i>

Do you know why?

00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:54,500
{\an8}It's obvious.

124
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:56,291
{\an8}There are no women.

125
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,708
{\an8}You're not a homosexual,
you're a misogynist.

126
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,583
{\an8}You were brewed in a cauldron, not a womb.

127
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:02,583
{\an8}No, señorita.

128
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:06,333
{\an8}Don't confuse misogyny with biology.
It's about facts. It's simple.

129
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:10,250
{\an8}Look, men need
to expel their poison. Okay?

130
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:12,750
{\an8}Every few hours, we need to boom boom.

131
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:16,416
{\an8}And after, we feel such repulsion
for the body we dumped in.

132
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,291
{\an8}It doesn't matter who it is,
we feel repulsion.

133
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:20,333
{\an8}So, we say, "Ciao."

134
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,958
{\an8}Boom, boom, ciao.

135
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,666
{\an8}- Precious.
- Homosexual sex.

136
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,666
{\an8}Sex between women is also homosexual.

137
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:30,166
{\an8}Boom, boom, ciao<i>. </i>Two men meet
each other and relieve one another.

138
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,541
Boom, boom, ciao. They don't even
share names. It's marvelous.

139
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:35,875
Do you know what's marvelous?

140
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:38,000
The incredible fucking women can do.

141
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:40,416
And we can do it ten times in a row.

142
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,375
- Or more.
- Multi-orgasmically.

143
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:45,500
We can go for hours,
not just five seconds.

144
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,416
I'm not saying God didn't provide you
with the possibility of pleasure,

145
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,333
that would be misogyny.

146
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:54,625
I am simply saying it's not a necessity.

147
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:55,666
Oh, sure.

148
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:59,416
It's not an organic need for you
like it is for men. Think about it, okay?

149
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:01,791
- The world is full of saunas…
- Sure.

150
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,916
…where men meet up and relieve each other.

151
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,541
Public parks and restrooms,
where we meet and boom boom and ciao<i>.</i>

152
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:08,875
Fundamentally selfish.

153
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:11,625
- Where are the women's saunas?
- We don't need them.

154
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:13,458
- Oh, no.
- Of course not.

155
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:17,791
There aren't any. Where can you find
restrooms where you can rub beavers?

156
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,291
Where are they? They don't exist.

157
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:22,750
I'll tell you why. And it's controversial.

158
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:27,125
It's that sex for females
is conditioned by procreation.

159
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:28,250
Really.

160
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:30,041
In one way or another,

161
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:34,291
you are ultimately looking
for a man to exchange genes with.

162
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:38,083
To form a family. Ugh, repulsive.

163
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:40,125
You have too many things in your head.

164
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:42,958
We only have one. Ejaculation.

165
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:45,041
So, we have the boom, boom, ciao<i>.</i>

166
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:47,458
Boom, boom, ciao. Boom, boom, ciao.

167
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:48,958
Homosexual sex!

168
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:50,458
Boom, boom, ciao.

169
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:53,666
Look, your theory is complete bullshit,
but it's got a nice ring to it.

170
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:54,583
I'm done.

171
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,625
- Boom, boom, ciao.
- I'm out.

172
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:58,500
Boom, boom, ciao.

173
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,125
- Professor!
- Boom, boom, ciao.

174
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:01,708
- Come on.
- Boom, boom, ciao.

175
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:02,958
The Professor!

176
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:04,375
Boom, boom, ciao.

177
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:05,458
Boom, boom, ciao.

178
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:07,458
- Boom, boom, ciao.
- Na, na, na…

179
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:10,208
- Loosen up, Professor!
- MEN: Boom, boom, ciao.

180
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:11,208
Boom, boom, ciao.

181
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,500
Boom, boom, ciao.

182
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,166
Boom, boom, ciao…

183
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:27,583
Goodnight. All right?

184
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:33,708
If you want that. No problem.

185
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,083
All right.

186
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:45,958
Look, we have
to be practical, Helsinki. Okay?

187
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,125
You're great. You're a titan, it's true.
I acknowledge that.

188
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:52,875
But we're professionals, you and I.

189
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,750
Unlike the rest of the morons
in the gang, right?

190
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:58,541
You're right.

191
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:01,583
Can you really imagine going in there
with emotional baggage?

192
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:04,125
It's absurd, right? We got our poison out.

193
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:05,875
We made boom, boom. And now…

194
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:07,041
And now, ciao.

195
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:09,291
No baggage.

196
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,625
Well, now we're blood brothers.

197
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:16,791
Brothers, comrades, isn't that right, huh?

198
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:17,708
Yeah.

199
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:18,625
Hmm?

200
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:25,041
Yeah, brothers.

201
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:48,500
What's wrong?

202
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,416
Better I sleep here.

203
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:54,041
Tomorrow is a big day.

204
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:56,750
He fucked you and then tossed you out.

205
00:14:58,458 --> 00:14:59,708
Fucking disgusting!

206
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:02,708
- It's like this between men.
- You're not like that.

207
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:06,375
We've been everywhere together
for the past two years

208
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:08,166
and you're a teddy bear, my love.

209
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:12,125
You're the type to spend 12 hours
latched to someone, like a koala,

210
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:13,333
and good for you.

211
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,333
We're comrades. Brothers.

212
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,791
How can you be his brother?

213
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:21,875
Helsinki!

214
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:25,208
You have to love yourself more.

215
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,583
Forget this fuck boy,
he treats you like shit.

216
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:35,166
The next time he tells you "Boom, boom,"
you have to say "Ciao."

217
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,791
And he can boom, boom
in someone else's asshole.

218
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,083
Okay, okay.

219
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:47,208
Helsi.

220
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,208
Are you in love?

221
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:03,291
Men take care of men.

222
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,583
Fuck my life.

00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:40,583
<i>"Is this hell?"</i>

229
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:44,833
<i>"What have I done wrong?" Nothing.</i>

233
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:56,541
Governor?

234
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,791
Governor?

235
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:02,250
Mr. Governor, your heart almost burst.

236
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:06,458
We've injected you with enough Diazepam
for a whole family. Please, lie down.

237
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:07,708
I'm perfectly fine.

238
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:10,500
Okay, okay, okay.

239
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:11,541
Be careful. Please.

240
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:13,041
Take it easy.

241
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:16,041
Well, I guess, if you're okay…

242
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:19,500
Come on. Let me show you
this little number we've set up.

243
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:21,500
Come, Mr. Governor. Look here.

244
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,583
What does it smell like?
Do you smell that?

245
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:26,000
What's that smell?

246
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:33,833
That's right! Nothing!
Industrial extractors.

247
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:36,458
We take the gases,
then we pass them through the machine

248
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:41,375
and we liquefy them and then…

249
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,625
…all the way to the vault.

250
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:46,958
Currently, our carbon footprint is zero.

251
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,333
We have to be a little careful
because tomorrow the zinc

252
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,666
and the carbon dioxide
will probably be crazy.

253
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,666
Right here

254
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:57,750
we're currently melting 52 bars per hour.

255
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:59,666

258
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,583
And we're not missing a drop of it.

259
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:09,500
We've melted 1,600 kilograms
so far. Heaven.

260
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,458
How many days was I unconscious?

261
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,000
Four hours.

00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,916

Look here, look here.

00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,875
Take a look, Mr. Governor.
Watch as the magic happens.

268
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,916
Watch it come out.
Ay, yai, yai. Oh, marvelous.

269
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:37,083

272
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,916
In here, we turn the liquid gold
into little granules.

273
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:52,208
Small pellets, you know,
like little grains of rice.

274
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:56,166
And we do it all with bubbles, you see?

275
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,291

Top-quality birdseed, Governor.

278
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:16,833
Listen to me, what you're doing
will have many, many consequences.

279
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:20,416
<i>And that's the lesson,</i>
<i>nothing is free.</i>

<i>Everything you do has consequences.</i>

281

<i>Almost a million people</i>

<i>The pressure on the government</i>
<i>is overwhelming.</i>

283
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:31,958
<i>And the big question, Sara Solomando,</i>
<i>what was in those boxes</i>

284
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:34,541
<i>that caused the police and army</i>
<i>to stop the attack?</i>

285
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:38,375
<i>At the moment Cristina,</i>
<i>the only official response is silence.</i>

286
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:40,583
<i>But since the attack</i>
<i>was brought to a halt,</i>

<i>official cars at the highest level</i>
<i>have not stopped arriving.</i>

the Minister of the Interior,

289
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,333
the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs

290
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:50,291
and the Chief of Staff of Defense.

291
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:53,000

00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:07,000
<i>The Minister of the Interior,</i>
<i>the defense staff,</i>

299
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,666
instead of one million people,

00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,000
The European Union
is demanding information.

301
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:27,416
Do the contents of the boxes involve them?

302
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,166
Of course it involves them,
can't they deduce that?

303
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,625
Your job is to lower diplomatic pressure.

Because if you don't, I can't do my job.

305
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:37,041
The problem is
they know this is really big.

306
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:41,500

00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:59,583
<i>The king and the rest</i>
<i>of the state institutions threatened.</i>

313
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:08,916
<i>The content of those 24 boxes took</i>
<i>less than an hour to reach Pakistan.</i>

314
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:13,916
<i>Our legion of hackers opened</i>
<i>a secure, undetectable back door</i>

315
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,458
<i>through a clear satellite.</i>

316
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:19,041
<i>If we published that information,</i>
<i>they were dead.</i>

317
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:21,291
<i>And they knew it.</i>

318
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,875
What's the actual size of this leak?

319
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,333
Colonel?

320
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:33,500
Minister?

321
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:42,083
The size of this leak…

322
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:47,958
Europe provoking a war in Libya
for private interests.

323
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:51,166
Payments to Morocco to abandon
immigrants in the desert.

324
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:54,583
A confidential agreement to
look the other way in the Mediterranean.

325
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:58,333
Seventy-four shipwrecks that could've
been avoided, hundreds of drownings.

326
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:01,375
Old news, but all the details
on the creation of a group of terrorists

327
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:03,541
in the south of France. Want me to go on?

328
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:07,833
The contents of these boxes condemn
the government and those before it.

329
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:11,125
It will fill Spain,
the European Union and NATO up with shit.

330
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:13,916
And what's worse,
we shoot ourselves in the head.

331
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,583
You, you, you and me.

332
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:19,958
Are we ready
to end up standing before a judge?

333
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:21,708
Is that what this president wants?

334
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:25,666
Is there a prime minister in Europe
who wants to go to jail? Huh?

335
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:33,166
That's the fucking size of this leak.

336
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:35,291
We can't negotiate with that man.

337
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:39,833
As long as he has secrets,
he'll continue to be a threat.

338
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:42,125
Okay, then.

339
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,000
What do you suggest?

340
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,458
There's only one thing to do.

341
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:51,333
And you're fully aware of that.

342
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:16,000
Good afternoon, I'm Alicia Sierra,
for those of you who don't know me.

343
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:18,875
And I'll be taking over the negotiation
of the heist.

344
00:23:18,958 --> 00:23:20,791
Let's get this party started.

345
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:25,291
I want three little teeny tiny things
that I know you all can handle.

346
00:23:25,375 --> 00:23:31,083
To know how much gasoline they have
in there to feed the emergency generator.

347
00:23:31,583 --> 00:23:33,083
Secondly,

348
00:23:34,583 --> 00:23:36,416
bring the underground equipment.

349
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,333
Tell me exactly what's down there.

350
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:42,291
Tunnels, galleries, sewers. Yeah?

351
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:43,208
And third,

352
00:23:44,541 --> 00:23:45,500
Antoñanzas.

353
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:48,000
Antoñanzas?

354
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:48,916
Inspector?

355
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,875
Great.

356
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:54,333
Donuts, licorice, lollipops and gum.

357
00:23:54,416 --> 00:23:56,125
Melon flavored. Burns your tongue.

358
00:23:56,208 --> 00:23:57,666
My hormones are fired up.

359
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:01,541
I need to look like a sweet woman while
dealing with that emasculated Professor.

360
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:03,083
Everything okay?

361
00:24:03,166 --> 00:24:05,208
Absolutely perfect. You're in command.

362
00:24:07,166 --> 00:24:08,541
Okay. Let's go.

363
00:24:13,791 --> 00:24:14,875
Martínez.

364
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:17,625
Inspector, we're trying
to triangulate the calls.

365
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:18,958
Inspector.

366
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:21,083
<i>In what country</i>
<i>was he being held?</i>

367
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:23,250
{\an8}<i>Why was he brought into Spain</i>
<i>on a secret plane?</i>

368
00:24:23,333 --> 00:24:25,333
{\an8}The pregnant woman who tortures.

369
00:24:25,416 --> 00:24:27,708
{\an8}Even the monkeys in Madagascar
will recognize me.

370
00:24:27,791 --> 00:24:29,416
He dropped like a rag doll.

371
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:34,041
Go on and get me gum.

372
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:36,500
{\an8}ALLEGED ILLEGAL INTERROGATION

373
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:38,666
I look fat.

374
00:24:41,458 --> 00:24:42,375
I look fat.

375
00:24:44,291 --> 00:24:47,375
Well, yesterday
we were looking at ways

376
00:24:47,458 --> 00:24:49,916
to stall for time
if they stop us here in Spain.

377
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,291
But what happens
if we manage to rob the Mint,

378
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:55,083
flee with the money and after some time,

379
00:24:55,166 --> 00:24:57,666
Interpol stops us in a foreign country?

380
00:24:58,166 --> 00:25:02,833
In all likelihood, they will want
to detain us in another country to…

381
00:25:02,916 --> 00:25:07,125
Well, to apply what they consider
improved interrogation techniques.

382
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,333
Torture.

383
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:12,958
The only good news is that

384
00:25:13,041 --> 00:25:15,750
at any given time,
we can use that to our advantage.

385
00:25:15,833 --> 00:25:18,791
Torture to our advantage? Great.
Why didn't I think of that?

386
00:25:18,875 --> 00:25:20,458
Even if they ignore the law,

387
00:25:20,541 --> 00:25:22,833
and the rights
and guarantees of law are waived,

388
00:25:23,333 --> 00:25:25,708
sooner or later,
they have to bring us back to Spain.

389
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:28,125
There will be transfers,
there will be vans.

390
00:25:28,666 --> 00:25:32,083
That is when you have to show yourself
as being completely destroyed,

391
00:25:32,166 --> 00:25:34,208
because there's always going
to be someone watching.

392
00:25:35,375 --> 00:25:37,750
And if people see and feel that brutality…

393
00:25:38,375 --> 00:25:40,916
That's when we have
an opportunity to negotiate.

394
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,458
Where you in the bathroom?

395
00:25:46,458 --> 00:25:47,291
Yes.

396
00:25:48,708 --> 00:25:52,250
You went at noon to deposit
your solid waste in the shared bathroom?

397
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:55,750
To shit. Yeah, I went to shit.
What about it?

398
00:25:55,833 --> 00:25:59,125
In the one we all use,
what happens I have to go in there now?

399
00:25:59,208 --> 00:26:01,458
Then light a match, I mean…

400
00:26:02,291 --> 00:26:05,541
Or you plug your nose with that finger
you always got up your ass.

401
00:26:05,625 --> 00:26:07,791
In other words, you got options.

402
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,083
Do you know what that smell is?
It's made up of particles.

403
00:26:12,166 --> 00:26:15,083
Your particles were in the sludge
of your intestines,

404
00:26:15,166 --> 00:26:16,500
floating around peacefully.

405
00:26:16,583 --> 00:26:18,333
Now they've departed

406
00:26:18,416 --> 00:26:22,625
along with your waste through
your filthy anus, devastating everything!

407
00:26:22,708 --> 00:26:25,500
And now I must accept that
entering my lungs?

408
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:27,041
So, cover your fucking nose.

409
00:26:27,125 --> 00:26:28,375
Why? You don't poop?

410
00:26:28,458 --> 00:26:32,458
Every day, religiously,
like clockwork, but at dawn.

411
00:26:32,541 --> 00:26:35,875
First, for privacy,
but fundamentally out of respect.

412
00:26:35,958 --> 00:26:38,375
- Respect, really?
- Out of respect.

413
00:26:38,458 --> 00:26:42,500
Because I don't think anyone should have
to inhale the particles of my shit.

414
00:26:42,583 --> 00:26:43,916
Let's not get all high and mighty.

415
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,166
It starts with a turd taboo and ends with
you addressing each other as "my liege."

416
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:49,291
- I don't mind being called "liege."
- You don't say.

417
00:26:49,375 --> 00:26:51,083
Look, uh…

418
00:26:52,291 --> 00:26:56,750
I know I'm not an elegant man like you.

419
00:26:57,333 --> 00:27:00,333
And I don't know as many things as you.

420
00:27:01,208 --> 00:27:05,958
I only know how to open holes
where even God wouldn't be able to.

421
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:07,666
Most importantly,

422
00:27:08,333 --> 00:27:12,666
I know how to lay my life on the line
for my team, if needed.

423
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,416
The question is whether

424
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,166
you are on my team or not.

425
00:27:20,791 --> 00:27:22,708
The question is
whether I'd risk my life for you.

426
00:27:22,791 --> 00:27:24,000
That's my question.

427
00:27:25,916 --> 00:27:27,083
The answer is that,

428
00:27:27,166 --> 00:27:31,750
despite your crude living habits
and your fondness for crossword puzzles,

429
00:27:32,458 --> 00:27:34,583
if the two of us go in together…

430
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,125
we come out together.

431
00:27:54,583 --> 00:27:57,291
Great, are we friends again? Yes?

432
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:01,166
Good.

433
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:03,958
Because what we were talking about
is very important.

434
00:28:05,916 --> 00:28:08,666
All of us, we're all at risk
of being arrested.

435
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:13,375
Let's see.

436
00:28:18,458 --> 00:28:21,625
Palermo?
Can you see anything with this eye?

437
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,791
I see your Russian Orthodox beard,
you fucking Serbian.

438
00:28:26,666 --> 00:28:28,125
Or is it Jeremiah Johnson?

439
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,708
I don't see the fucking mule though,
where is she? Huh?

440
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:34,583
- I can see, fat man.
- Let's check the other.

441
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:37,958
How about this?

442
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:50,083
It's all right, just has to heal.
Tomorrow you'll see better.

443
00:28:51,458 --> 00:28:52,708
We'll put a patch on.

444
00:29:00,208 --> 00:29:01,333
I'll go find a cane.

445
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:09,583
{\an8}ALLEGED ILLEGAL INTERROGATION

446
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,041
Palermo, are you there?

447
00:29:20,375 --> 00:29:22,833
- The all-seeing eye is here, Professor.
- Is Tokyo close?

448
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:27,125
Yeah, she's here.

449
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,333
Professor.

450
00:29:42,208 --> 00:29:43,375
Tokyo,

451
00:29:46,416 --> 00:29:47,500
Rio is in Spain.

452
00:29:59,083 --> 00:29:59,916
Thank you.

453
00:30:01,875 --> 00:30:03,541
I hope I'll be able to hug you

454
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:06,125
<i>and thank you in person really soon.</i>

455
00:30:06,208 --> 00:30:08,041
Of course you will.

456
00:30:13,541 --> 00:30:17,000
<i>Tokyo, the hardest part</i>
<i>is still ahead of us, but we'll get there.</i>

457
00:30:18,833 --> 00:30:19,916
We're gonna do it.

458
00:30:32,375 --> 00:30:33,708
<i>All actions,</i>

459
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:36,958
<i>all of them, have consequences.</i>

460
00:30:37,791 --> 00:30:39,041
<i>And for the police…</i>

461
00:30:39,125 --> 00:30:39,958
Colonel!

462
00:30:40,041 --> 00:30:41,875
<i>…in the darkest moment,</i>

463
00:30:41,958 --> 00:30:43,291
<i>a light would</i> <i>appear.</i>

464
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:46,416
- We've started to triangulate the signal.
- Like for a cell phone?

465
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:50,166
It's not precise, not even close.
But ITU has receivers throughout Spain.

466
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,250
The signal is reaching Galicia,
Alicante and even the rest of Europe.

467
00:30:54,333 --> 00:30:57,291
But the important thing is that
it's stronger south of the peninsula.

468
00:30:58,083 --> 00:31:01,208
- I think they're broadcasting from there.
- How precise is this?

469
00:31:02,833 --> 00:31:03,875
This is the radius.

470
00:31:06,458 --> 00:31:09,916
He's directing the robbery from a beach?
While on vacation with his cousin Rosita?

471
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,833
Come on, man!

472
00:31:10,916 --> 00:31:14,583
Colonel, just think about it. It doesn't
make sense for them to be close.

473
00:31:14,666 --> 00:31:17,500
He did that last time. He knows we'll scan
the buildings near the bank.

474
00:31:17,583 --> 00:31:20,750
So they could be in Portugal,
Andalusia or Morocco?

475
00:31:20,833 --> 00:31:24,583
Anywhere is safer than Madrid…
All they need is a phone and a radio.

476
00:31:26,791 --> 00:31:28,458
Colonel, they know our protocols.

477
00:31:29,208 --> 00:31:32,208
And they know that we're incapable
of investigating a robbery

478
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:34,541
600 kilometers away from a hostage crisis.

479
00:31:35,375 --> 00:31:36,708
I think you better head out there.

480
00:31:37,541 --> 00:31:40,375
- Sure, that's a large area…
- What the fuck, Ángel!

481
00:31:40,458 --> 00:31:43,208
- Let's at least narrow it down first.
- You're going down there now.

482
00:31:44,416 --> 00:31:46,375
I need your absolute discretion. Got it?

483
00:31:46,958 --> 00:31:49,583
If you find there's something to this,
I'd prefer you're there

484
00:31:49,666 --> 00:31:52,500
and not a couple of hick Civil Guards
who will scare them off.

485
00:31:52,583 --> 00:31:54,458
- Martínez, come here!
- Yes.

486
00:31:56,625 --> 00:31:58,291
You're going to give him support.

487
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:01,500
I want you to study
this signal exclusively. Nothing else.

488
00:32:01,583 --> 00:32:02,583
All right.

489
00:32:02,666 --> 00:32:05,041
Don't say anything to anyone.

490
00:32:25,291 --> 00:32:28,833
I'd love to travel somewhere with you,
like a weekend trip.

491
00:32:29,666 --> 00:32:31,708
But without having to rob something.

492
00:32:31,791 --> 00:32:34,625
- Oh, yes, it could be our honeymoon.
- Yeah.

493
00:32:36,416 --> 00:32:39,333
Well, we would have to get married first.

494
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:42,541
I already live with your mother.
Marrying you isn't a big deal.

495
00:32:42,625 --> 00:32:43,500
Excuse me?

496
00:32:45,041 --> 00:32:47,208
- What the fuck are you saying?
- Pardon?

497
00:32:47,291 --> 00:32:49,625
Marrying me isn't such a big deal for you?

498
00:32:49,708 --> 00:32:51,958
What is that?
The marriage proposal of a pussy?

499
00:32:52,041 --> 00:32:54,666
Why buy a cow
if you can get the milk for free, right?

500
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:56,250
I didn't mean anything by it.

501
00:32:56,333 --> 00:32:58,208
Forget it, you're making it worse.

502
00:32:59,166 --> 00:33:00,291
Call Marseille now.

503
00:33:01,708 --> 00:33:02,541
Of course.

504
00:33:02,625 --> 00:33:03,500
And listen,

505
00:33:04,458 --> 00:33:05,916
if you wanna marry me,

506
00:33:07,333 --> 00:33:10,041
make sure next time
you ask me the right away.

507
00:33:12,333 --> 00:33:14,166
Find somewhere to stop, come on.

508
00:33:49,666 --> 00:33:51,208
Inspector. It's him.

509
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:04,833
Professor.

510
00:34:07,541 --> 00:34:10,583
Inspector Sierra, how nice.
I was looking forward to speaking to you.

511
00:34:11,958 --> 00:34:15,583
Yeah, I know how much you like negotiating
with female police officers.

512
00:34:15,666 --> 00:34:18,333
Aren't you gonna ask me
about what I'm wearing?

513
00:34:18,416 --> 00:34:19,791
Maternity clothes, I presume.

514
00:34:19,875 --> 00:34:22,250
Oh, you're so antiquated!

515
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,416
Are you the kind of guy
that wears a wifebeater?

516
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,458
Well, to be honest, I do, but…

517
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:32,583
Inspector, you can't go wrong
with a classic. Don't you agree?

518
00:34:32,666 --> 00:34:36,166
Plus, you know, an undershirt
can make you feel like Pablo Escobar

519
00:34:36,791 --> 00:34:38,958
or Marlon Brando in
<i>Streetcar Named Desire.</i>

520
00:34:39,041 --> 00:34:41,416
Touché.

521
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,208
Tell me something.

522
00:34:43,291 --> 00:34:45,625
Have you ever
recorded yourself making love?

523
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:48,166
Let me think about that…

524
00:34:51,083 --> 00:34:52,875
No, the truth is I haven't.

525
00:34:54,208 --> 00:34:57,458
I imagine that's because I haven't
suggested it, I'm a timid man.

526
00:34:57,541 --> 00:34:59,500
If that's the case, perhaps I can help.

527
00:35:00,041 --> 00:35:01,166
Raquel!

528
00:35:03,708 --> 00:35:04,916
You're listening to me, right?

529
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:06,833
Raquel?

530
00:35:09,208 --> 00:35:11,541
Hello, Alicia. Been a long time.

531
00:35:11,625 --> 00:35:12,958
A long time, yeah.

532
00:35:13,791 --> 00:35:16,375
Seems like your Professor
has reservations about

533
00:35:16,458 --> 00:35:17,833
<i>asking you to make a sex tape.</i>

534
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:21,375
But you did that in your second year
of academy with Hortigosa.

535
00:35:21,458 --> 00:35:24,083
Fuck me! Well…

536
00:35:24,166 --> 00:35:25,541
Alicia, you disappoint me.

537
00:35:25,625 --> 00:35:26,958
<i>Look,</i>

538
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:29,208
I'm gonna tell you
what you're trying to do.

539
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,208
You're trying hard to take control
over the conversation

540
00:35:35,291 --> 00:35:39,416
with nice words and then
drop a bomb trying to divide us.

541
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:41,750
Negotiation 101.

542
00:35:41,833 --> 00:35:45,000
Not at all. I was just having fun.

543
00:35:46,625 --> 00:35:48,875
The bomb comes now.

544
00:35:50,458 --> 00:35:54,250
Since you're classified as terrorists,
I've got the CIA, Europol,

545
00:35:54,333 --> 00:35:57,333
<i>and Christ himself looking</i>
<i>for </i>y<i>our mother and your daughter.</i>

546
00:35:58,083 --> 00:35:59,500
<i>I don't know where they are,</i>

547
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:03,958
but I'm guessing
you didn't escape to Norway,

548
00:36:04,708 --> 00:36:08,833
probably some tropical paradise
with useless, ineffective police.

549
00:36:10,208 --> 00:36:12,541
Southeast Asia, for example.

550
00:36:13,833 --> 00:36:15,000
I would do the same.

551
00:36:16,291 --> 00:36:19,333
Do you know what the bad part is
about those countries, Raquel?

552
00:36:19,833 --> 00:36:21,208
You tell me, Alicia.

553
00:36:25,041 --> 00:36:26,000
The jails there.

554
00:36:29,291 --> 00:36:30,208
<i>So foul.</i>

555
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,916
<i>Overcrowding, infections,</i>

556
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,500
<i>drugs, murders.</i>

557
00:36:34,583 --> 00:36:37,333
<i>Everything</i>
<i>And your mother in there…</i>

558
00:36:37,416 --> 00:36:39,875
With her age and how confused she gets.
And Paula?

559
00:36:40,583 --> 00:36:41,625
Oh, Paulita.

560
00:36:42,208 --> 00:36:45,208
<i>Considering I could stall the extradition,</i>
<i>I can't imagine how she'd feel.</i>

561
00:36:45,291 --> 00:36:46,750
<i>Well, I can imagine it.</i>

562
00:36:46,833 --> 00:36:48,916
Crying every night
in an orphanage in Jakarta.

563
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Shit, that poor baby.

564
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:54,666
<i>My congrats, Raquel. You've done great.</i>
<i>You won a little puppet man.</i>

565
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:57,666
And I'm sure you get
at least one screw a month.

566
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:59,000
But you lost a family.

567
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:03,458
If you give me the Professor,
I'll leave them alone.

568
00:37:12,875 --> 00:37:14,083
Why did you say that to her?

569
00:37:14,166 --> 00:37:17,416
Because this is a game of cards,
and I just played a flush.

570
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:21,083
Hmm? And now they'll be fucked
for a little bit. That's what's is about.

571
00:37:21,958 --> 00:37:22,875
Fucking with them.

572
00:37:25,708 --> 00:37:26,541
No?

573
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:49,000
Calm down.

574
00:37:50,416 --> 00:37:53,041
- She's bluffing.
- You called her and lost control.

575
00:37:53,125 --> 00:37:54,500
You took control from me.

576
00:37:54,583 --> 00:37:57,666
- And she beat you. Manipulated you.
- She manipulated you.

577
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:01,000
- She manipulated you!
- She played you like a puppet!

578
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:03,958
She hung up
and we didn't even play our hand.

579
00:38:07,791 --> 00:38:10,208
She went after you
because you're the weakest link.

580
00:38:41,833 --> 00:38:44,708
Hey, mongrels! Get me some water.

581
00:38:44,791 --> 00:38:46,000
What'd you just call me?

582
00:38:47,833 --> 00:38:48,666
Mongrel.

583
00:38:49,166 --> 00:38:54,500
But I could also call you kebab,
fortune teller or melon-peddler.

584
00:38:57,041 --> 00:38:59,666
Do you really think you're in the position
to bust my balls?

585
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:00,750
Nah.

586
00:39:00,833 --> 00:39:04,708
I don't wanna be anywhere close
to your foul-smelling cunt.

587
00:39:09,666 --> 00:39:10,833
Gandía. Correct?

588
00:39:20,208 --> 00:39:23,458
Is it just me or is there
a certain negativity in the air?

589
00:39:23,541 --> 00:39:25,208
Very bad vibrations.

590
00:39:25,833 --> 00:39:27,708
Bring me to him, I wanna talk.

591
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:31,208
And leave me alone with him.

592
00:39:33,583 --> 00:39:35,708
He's sitting on the ground
in front of you.

593
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,250
Smells like shit.

594
00:39:50,708 --> 00:39:52,166
I can't see well…

595
00:39:54,666 --> 00:39:56,750
but I'm developing my other senses.

596
00:39:59,666 --> 00:40:02,375
And my intuition tells me
you don't respect us.

597
00:40:03,375 --> 00:40:06,166
When clowns put on masks
that's what they get.

598
00:40:06,666 --> 00:40:08,208
They don't deserve respect.

599
00:40:11,333 --> 00:40:14,583
A very logical thought coming
from someone of your rank,

600
00:40:14,666 --> 00:40:16,750
but you're wrong my skinny friend.

601
00:40:17,958 --> 00:40:20,333
Or you watched too much TV
and you think we're Robin Hood?

602
00:40:21,083 --> 00:40:23,458
That we're lovable stuffed animals
with a Dalí mask.

603
00:40:24,375 --> 00:40:25,333
Is that it?

604
00:40:26,333 --> 00:40:29,333
No, I think
you're just a mother fucking faggot,

605
00:40:29,416 --> 00:40:32,166
one-eyed, piece of shit, worthless <i>sudaca</i>.

606
00:40:35,416 --> 00:40:36,333
<i>Sudaca.</i>

607
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:41,166
From South America, that's right.

608
00:40:43,166 --> 00:40:46,000
But from a German school.
The school of Berlin.

609
00:40:47,583 --> 00:40:48,750
Stay there.

610
00:40:49,166 --> 00:40:50,791
Oh, how I love piñatas.

611
00:40:51,958 --> 00:40:52,916
Quiet.

612
00:40:53,458 --> 00:40:55,125
Son of a bitch!

613
00:40:55,208 --> 00:40:57,541
- Palermo!
- Don't move! Stay still.

614
00:40:57,625 --> 00:41:01,500
The <i>sudaca </i>who has come to reclaim
the gold you looted, you son of a bitch.

615
00:41:01,583 --> 00:41:04,666
- Denver, stop him!
- Stay where you are.

616
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:06,750
Palermo! Denver, stop him!

617
00:41:06,833 --> 00:41:10,833
Gold bathed in the blood
of South Americans! Satanic rites!

618
00:41:10,916 --> 00:41:13,666
- Fucking reptile!
- That's enough!

619
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:15,791
You better fucking try and kill me,

620
00:41:15,875 --> 00:41:19,250
or I'll use pliers to pull your guts
out of your ass, you motherfucker!

621
00:41:19,333 --> 00:41:21,041
You mother fucker! Come on!

622
00:41:21,125 --> 00:41:23,583
- I'm gonna kill him!
- Nobody move! Stay still!

623
00:41:23,666 --> 00:41:27,000
Come fucking hit me, come hit me!
You motherfucker!

624
00:41:27,791 --> 00:41:30,625
Motherfucker! Come on!

625
00:41:31,833 --> 00:41:35,208
You've brought us all down
to the same fucking level as the Taliban.

626
00:41:35,833 --> 00:41:37,666
What were you trying to demonstrate?

627
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:38,583
Authority?

628
00:41:39,291 --> 00:41:41,666
Beating the crap out of
a guy who's all tied up?

629
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:44,208
The only thing that demonstrates
is you're a piece of shit!

630
00:41:44,291 --> 00:41:46,750
Let him go and send him over.
I'll take him on with one hand.

631
00:41:46,833 --> 00:41:48,583
I will fuck him up. Bring him in!

632
00:41:48,666 --> 00:41:52,041
Professor put a crazy person in charge.
We can't keep listening to this psycho.

633
00:41:52,125 --> 00:41:56,375
No, no, no. Listen to me, Palermo.
We've got a plan and this plan has rules.

634
00:41:56,458 --> 00:41:58,166
Implemented by the Professor.

635
00:41:58,250 --> 00:41:59,541
And we don't break them.

636
00:41:59,625 --> 00:42:01,375
Oh, yeah? Where is the Professor?

637
00:42:01,458 --> 00:42:05,083
Where is Mr. Professor?
He's never around, Mr. Professor!

638
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:08,333
Raise your hand if you have
the scepter of command!

639
00:42:08,416 --> 00:42:10,500
I have the scepter! I'm in charge!

640
00:42:10,583 --> 00:42:11,708
- I'm the boss. Silence!
- Hey.

641
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:25,833
I'll explain one thing about the laws
that govern in here now.

642
00:42:27,375 --> 00:42:29,500
For any mother fucker here

643
00:42:30,958 --> 00:42:35,000
who fucking dares to insult one of us,
I will break his head open.

644
00:42:36,916 --> 00:42:39,375
And you, mongrel,
better learn to shut your mouth.

645
00:42:40,708 --> 00:42:44,583
Unless you wanna open your mouth
to thank me for the fact

646
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:48,041
that I stepped in to defend you
for instance, no?

647
00:42:49,083 --> 00:42:53,625
I do not need a piece of trash like you
to defend me.

648
00:42:53,708 --> 00:42:55,208
Haven't you been paying attention?

649
00:42:55,291 --> 00:42:57,625
The same way you hit a defenseless guy,

650
00:42:57,708 --> 00:43:01,250
I could take my gun,
smack you in the head, knock you out

651
00:43:02,333 --> 00:43:03,208
and take command.

652
00:43:05,125 --> 00:43:06,041
Oh, yeah?

653
00:43:08,458 --> 00:43:09,541
Helsinki, tie her up.

654
00:43:11,708 --> 00:43:15,500
Tie her hands and her feet and take her
down to the forge for mutiny. Right now.

655
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:20,666
Don't even think about it. Helsi, Helsi!

656
00:43:21,291 --> 00:43:22,125
- Nairobi.
- Helsi.

657
00:43:22,208 --> 00:43:23,166
"Helsi?"

658
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:26,333
"Ay, Helsi."

659
00:43:27,041 --> 00:43:27,875
Excuse me.

660
00:43:28,375 --> 00:43:33,416
Is it just me? Or are you speaking to him
from your emotional baggage, is that it?

661
00:43:35,708 --> 00:43:39,083
Do you secretly
wanna be Ms. Helsinki?

662
00:43:42,958 --> 00:43:44,041
Why, Nairobi…

663
00:43:44,125 --> 00:43:47,958
Why chase an impossible love?
Why would you do that? Huh?

664
00:43:48,458 --> 00:43:52,958
Aren't you cheating yourself, genius?
Huh? Or are you just playing mama?

665
00:43:56,125 --> 00:43:58,958
I'm sorry to say that
the only thing you can do now

666
00:43:59,041 --> 00:44:01,458
is to assume the role
of the faggot's friend.

667
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:03,916
You're the fucking straight friend.

668
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,416
I'm sorry,
but Helsinki loves me. Doesn't he?

669
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:07,625
I apologize.

670
00:44:07,708 --> 00:44:11,250
Look, I'll tell you a couple of things
that you probably already know.

671
00:44:11,333 --> 00:44:12,875
You're certainly old enough.

672
00:44:12,958 --> 00:44:15,375
In matters of the heart,
there is the lover

673
00:44:16,083 --> 00:44:17,041
and the beloved.

674
00:44:17,125 --> 00:44:19,250
The lover lives with passion,

675
00:44:19,333 --> 00:44:22,375
with full commitment and romanticism.

676
00:44:22,458 --> 00:44:23,416
The beloved

677
00:44:24,833 --> 00:44:26,791
is limited to being idolized.

678
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:30,875
I'm not saying that being a lover is bad.
Don't get me wrong.

679
00:44:30,958 --> 00:44:32,666
But you have to know what happens.

680
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:35,750
You suffer a lot, my dear.

681
00:44:35,833 --> 00:44:36,833
Hmm?

682
00:44:37,791 --> 00:44:39,708
I'm the one having the better time.

683
00:44:39,791 --> 00:44:42,708
In our relationship, the only thing
I get out of it is sexual.

684
00:44:43,375 --> 00:44:46,125
It's the law of love.
I'm sorry. That's the way it is.

685
00:44:51,666 --> 00:44:56,416
The only pathetic one in this entire story

686
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:58,333
is you.

687
00:44:59,041 --> 00:45:03,583
With your talk about love,
about "Boom, boom, ciao." Wow.

688
00:45:04,958 --> 00:45:08,583
Could it be
because you'll never admit the truth?

689
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:12,875
The only truth is what is real.

690
00:45:13,666 --> 00:45:17,458
Let me explain.
Look. You love the fat guy.

691
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:19,583
The fat guy loves me.

692
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:21,958
And I love no one.

693
00:45:22,041 --> 00:45:23,791
And that's precisely why

694
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:26,458
you hate me.

695
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:29,375
Oh, really? You love no one?

696
00:45:31,291 --> 00:45:33,166
Of course not, honey.

697
00:45:35,291 --> 00:45:36,833
You don't have the balls.

698
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:39,958
You need courage to love.

699
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,250
And as for me? Watch.

700
00:45:44,625 --> 00:45:46,125
Helsinki…

701
00:45:48,041 --> 00:45:51,166
I love you. I love you so much…

702
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:55,000
that I would build a family with you.

703
00:45:57,208 --> 00:45:59,750
You see? That's bravery.

704
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,041
I feel it and I say it.

705
00:46:05,791 --> 00:46:06,625
That's what

706
00:46:07,208 --> 00:46:08,500
you're not capable of.

707
00:46:10,083 --> 00:46:11,541
Because how long has it been?

708
00:46:12,083 --> 00:46:15,208
Ten years
that you've been in love with Berlin?

709
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:17,875
And you never dared to open your mouth.

710
00:46:20,625 --> 00:46:25,208
You worshiped him like a god.
You followed him around like a little dog.

711
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:27,583
But you said nothing.

712
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:30,833
And now what?

713
00:46:31,708 --> 00:46:33,041
You're stuck with nothing.

714
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:35,500
He's gone forever.

715
00:46:38,458 --> 00:46:39,500
And you're empty.

716
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:44,791
The only thing you can do now
is hide behind bullshit speeches…

717
00:46:44,875 --> 00:46:46,625
"Boom, boom, ciao" because…

718
00:46:49,333 --> 00:46:50,375
Because you know

719
00:46:51,583 --> 00:46:53,958
that you've been
left behind forever, my friend.

720
00:47:05,375 --> 00:47:06,791
Let's get back to work.
