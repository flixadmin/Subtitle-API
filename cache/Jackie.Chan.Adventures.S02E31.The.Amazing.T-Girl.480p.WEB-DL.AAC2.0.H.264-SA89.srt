1
00:00:00,767 --> 00:00:02,968
(Alarm blares)

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:04,036
The main vault.

3
00:00:04,038 --> 00:00:05,537
I apologize in advance

4
00:00:05,539 --> 00:00:08,707
if Jade has been on
one of her "talisman raids."

5
00:00:10,143 --> 00:00:11,243
(Alarm stops)

6
00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:12,978
Alarm circuit
disengaged.

7
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,980
I'm sorry.
Do you have clearance?

8
00:00:14,982 --> 00:00:16,248
Captain black.

9
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,683
You did know
my technicians

10
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:18,817
would be installing

11
00:00:18,819 --> 00:00:20,719
the new vault
security system today?

12
00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:22,554
Must have missed
the memo, hirsch.

13
00:00:22,556 --> 00:00:25,824
Ooh, I bet the higher-ups
heard I cracked
the old system.

14
00:00:25,826 --> 00:00:26,892
Heh heh.

15
00:00:26,894 --> 00:00:29,361
Jade has a very active
imagination.

16
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:30,763
(Whirring)

17
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:35,901
What are <i> those?</i>

18
00:00:35,903 --> 00:00:38,370
<i>Those</i> would be
level 3 classified.

19
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:39,571
The kid's right.

20
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:41,140
Sorry, hirsch.

21
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:44,810
Classified or no,

22
00:00:44,812 --> 00:00:46,845
<i>those</i> are not
on my list, captain.

23
00:00:46,847 --> 00:00:48,013
They will have to go.

24
00:00:48,015 --> 00:00:49,114
What?!
- What?!

25
00:00:49,116 --> 00:00:51,150
I'll handle this,
Jackie.

26
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,787
You are so busted.

27
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:57,356
(Blows raspberry)

28
00:00:57,358 --> 00:00:58,724
Black here.

29
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:01,026
Operations is insisting
we remove level 3 classifieds

30
00:01:01,028 --> 00:01:02,628
from the vaul--

31
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:04,129
the talismans, sir.

32
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:06,231
Right.

33
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:08,167
The magic ones.

34
00:01:08,169 --> 00:01:09,234
Mm-hmm.

35
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:10,502
Mm-hmm.

36
00:01:10,504 --> 00:01:11,603
I see.

37
00:01:11,605 --> 00:01:12,671
Well?
- Well?

38
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:14,540
We have to clear
the talismans

39
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:16,041
out of the vault.

40
00:01:16,043 --> 00:01:17,309
Pronto.

41
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:13,532
Captain black is trying

42
00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:15,100
to pull strings
with Washington,

43
00:02:15,102 --> 00:02:17,136
but it does not look
promising.

44
00:02:17,138 --> 00:02:18,203
Hmm.

45
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:19,304
What's
the big whoop?

46
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:20,973
We can keep
the talismans here

47
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:22,374
in one of uncle's
magic boxes.

48
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:24,343
The risk is too great.

49
00:02:24,345 --> 00:02:26,178
The talismans
will be safest

50
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,913
from dark forces

51
00:02:27,915 --> 00:02:30,682
on sacred ground.

52
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:33,852
We must take them
to the Ben-shui temple.

53
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:37,256
But--but isn't that,
like, near China?

54
00:02:37,258 --> 00:02:40,125
Jade, the talismans
are unpredictable,

55
00:02:40,127 --> 00:02:41,393
dangerous.

56
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:42,895
You should not be
playing with them

57
00:02:42,897 --> 00:02:44,129
in the first place.

58
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:45,831
(Blows raspberry)

59
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:11,456
(Snip)

60
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:20,299
Testing.

61
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:25,837
I'm in.

62
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:30,309
I'm gonna miss you guys.

63
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:32,211
How about one last
hurrah,

64
00:03:32,213 --> 00:03:34,046
for old times' sake?

65
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:44,856
Hmm.

66
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:50,896
(Hydraulic humming)

67
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,633
Uh-oh.

68
00:03:58,304 --> 00:03:59,438
Huh?

69
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:04,843
Aah! Ooh--

70
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:06,612
(groaning)

71
00:04:06,614 --> 00:04:10,482
Man: Section 13's a long way
from Washington,
captain black.

72
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:13,819
Black: I promise your trip
will be worthwhile, sir.

73
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:18,857
(Gasps)
Black: Follow me.

74
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:21,660
Once you see
just how powerful
these talismans are,

75
00:04:21,662 --> 00:04:24,796
I'm sure you'll agree
it's imperative
we keep them here,

76
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:26,765
under lock and laser.

77
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:28,000
Whew.

78
00:04:28,002 --> 00:04:29,868
Those guys must be blind.

79
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,703
Observe.

80
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:33,305
The power of...

81
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:35,540
Invisibility.

82
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,379
Astonishing, isn't it?

83
00:04:40,381 --> 00:04:43,015
I could be over here.

84
00:04:43,017 --> 00:04:45,751
Or perhaps
I'm over here.

85
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,962
Hmm. Must not be
doing it right.

86
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:58,063
Never mind.

87
00:04:58,065 --> 00:04:59,531
Let's try...

88
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:02,000
Levitation.

89
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:06,505
(Grunting)

90
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:10,042
Uhh...

91
00:05:10,044 --> 00:05:11,977
I...Don't understand.
It's--

92
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:13,312
running a section

93
00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:15,614
can be very stressful,
captain black.

94
00:05:15,616 --> 00:05:18,684
I'm authorizing 2 weeks
of r and r,

95
00:05:18,686 --> 00:05:20,919
effective immediately.

96
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:24,256
I suggest you get
as far away from here

97
00:05:24,258 --> 00:05:25,724
as possible.

98
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:33,198
I'm very sorry
about this.

99
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,533
You should be sorry.

100
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:37,269
We are not used to
traveling with outsiders.

101
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:39,538
You are ruining
our feng shui.

102
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,040
Uh...I meant
about the talismans.

103
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:44,943
I just couldn't
get the rocks
to work their magic.

104
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:47,245
You gotta have
the right touch.

105
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:49,381
Jade...

106
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:54,419
Not even for
demonstration purposes?

107
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:55,520
No.

108
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:57,122
Rats!

109
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,761
Now, be a good girl
and play with your moose.

110
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:05,964
Guh-huh!

111
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:07,999
Right on,
Mr. mean jeans.

112
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:09,701
Yes...

113
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:12,237
Magic approaches.

114
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:13,772
Potent magic.

115
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:16,408
Huh?

116
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:19,244
The talismans
of shendu!

117
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:27,452
Gan. Chui. Ren.

118
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:30,355
Reclaim the talismans

119
00:06:30,357 --> 00:06:32,524
for the forces of darkness.

120
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:40,198
(Groans)

121
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,767
We must rest now.

122
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:43,902
Because the sun is high?

123
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,871
Because uncle
is pooped.

124
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,874
Right.
I'll scout ahead.

125
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:52,577
I'm not tired.
I'll scout, too.

126
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:01,086
Last one up the trail
is a monkey's talisman.

127
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:04,923
Ahoy there!

128
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:16,935
(Gasps)

129
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,574
Ahh!

130
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:26,278
You must be
the Ben-shui monks.

131
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,047
No! They're daolon wong's
dark warriors!

132
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:31,116
Hello!

133
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:32,451
Evil forces ahead.

134
00:07:32,453 --> 00:07:34,286
Bad chi rising.

135
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:36,288
Why are you ignoring me?

136
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,622
What a coinkidink.

137
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,791
We were just on our way
to your temple

138
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,259
to give you these.

139
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:42,527
Jackie!

140
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,598
Jackie! Jackie!

141
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,666
Wake up!

142
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:49,334
Wake up!
- (Snoring)

143
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:50,535
Aah!

144
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:52,471
What am I doing there?

145
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:54,706
Astral projection?

146
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,174
But I didn't touch
the tal--

147
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:58,043
talk to myself later.

148
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,413
Jackie! Wake up!

149
00:08:01,415 --> 00:08:02,481
(Sputtering)

150
00:08:02,483 --> 00:08:03,582
What?

151
00:08:03,584 --> 00:08:04,783
What is it?

152
00:08:04,785 --> 00:08:06,918
Dark warriors!
That way!

153
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,854
You guys sure don't
talk much.

154
00:08:08,856 --> 00:08:10,455
Vow of silence?

155
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,660
Jackie:
Captain black, no!

156
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,762
Uncle: They are impostors!

157
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,501
(All gasp)

158
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:24,035
Whoa, Nellie.

159
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,438
Jackie!

160
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,349
Take the talismans
to the temple, quickly!

161
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:40,819
Uncle! Jackie!

162
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:42,821
You won't believe this,
but--

163
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:44,356
wha--

164
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,525
no! The talismans!

165
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:48,426
The <i> talismans!</i>

166
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,097
Daah!

167
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:12,551
Hand over the talismans!

168
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:20,692
Huh?

169
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:21,960
Broken?

170
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:23,295
Told you.

171
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:24,963
Ohh!

172
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:31,870
The forces of darkness

173
00:09:31,872 --> 00:09:34,873
have just grown
more powerful.

174
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,250
Do not be concerned,
friends.

175
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,953
The power of the talismans
lies within.

176
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:49,988
You got them back?

177
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,623
Jackie, Jackie.

178
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:54,726
The holy man speaks
in the mystical sense.

179
00:09:54,728 --> 00:09:57,796
As in, "may the force
be with you."

180
00:09:57,798 --> 00:09:59,764
Or, "we are the world."

181
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:01,433
Right?

182
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:02,734
Oh, no, no.

183
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:04,569
The power of the talismans

184
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:06,104
truly lies...

185
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:07,872
Within.

186
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:14,613
Jade: Jackie, check it out!

187
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:16,314
I'm super strong.

188
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,416
Super fast.

189
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:20,051
Super gone.

190
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:21,753
Super chimp.

191
00:10:21,755 --> 00:10:23,722
Super talisman powered.

192
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,127
I'm t-girl!

193
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,162
H-h-h-how?

194
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:32,831
Not sure, but I think

195
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:35,133
each finger controls
a different power,

196
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,402
which would leave 2
unaccounted for.

197
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:39,504
Not what I meant!

198
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:42,073
Oh. Not sure <i> how</i>
it happened.

199
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:43,408
Maybe...

200
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,844
(Gasp) When I got zapped
in the vault.

201
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:46,945
Duh.

202
00:10:46,947 --> 00:10:49,714
Aah!
Aah!
- Aah!

203
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,249
Whoa.

204
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:53,585
So that's how I do
heat beam eyes.

205
00:10:53,587 --> 00:10:56,054
Maybe dragon blast
is my bellybutton.

206
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:57,856
No, Jade!
No dragon blast!

207
00:10:57,858 --> 00:11:01,259
The powers must be
returned to their
proper vessels,

208
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:03,194
with a restoration spell.

209
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:04,529
Ohh...

210
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:07,899
But we must first retrieve
the talismans themselves.

211
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:10,435
Well, what are we waiting for?

212
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:13,271
Let's find wong and stomp
his ancient, shriveled--

213
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:14,773
but, Jackie,

214
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:16,641
I have the power.

215
00:11:16,643 --> 00:11:18,443
Which daolon wong wants.

216
00:11:18,445 --> 00:11:20,712
Which is why
you must stay here...

217
00:11:20,714 --> 00:11:21,880
Safe.

218
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:27,318
The power of...

219
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,853
Invisibility.

220
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,456
Am I over here?

221
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:33,992
Or perhaps over here?

222
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:38,463
Uuh?

223
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,533
Pah!

224
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,669
Dragon blast!

225
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:46,404
(Exasperated snort)

226
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:48,006
Heat beam eyes!

227
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:50,709
Forgeries!

228
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:52,577
We have been tricked!

229
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:58,850
(Sighs)

230
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:02,020
Rooster, ox, snake,
rabbit, sheep,

231
00:12:02,022 --> 00:12:04,155
monkey, tiger, dog,
horse...

232
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:05,290
Rat!

233
00:12:05,292 --> 00:12:07,892
Haven't put <i> that</i> bad boy
to the test.

234
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,464
Motion to the motionless.

235
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:14,999
Guh-huh.

236
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,839
Why are we stopping?

237
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:23,241
Uncle has the willies.

238
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:26,678
Daolon: That's not all
that you have, old man.

239
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,047
Surrender the talismans
and--

240
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:30,215
let me guess.

241
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:32,217
No one gets hurt.

242
00:12:32,219 --> 00:12:33,952
Who is this joker?

243
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:38,056
Whoa!
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

244
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:40,792
Daolon wong
is a very powerful

245
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:42,460
dark chi master.

246
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,829
No joke.

247
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:46,898
Now, where have you hidden

248
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,834
the real talismans,
chi wizard?

249
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:52,804
That would be
none of your beeswax.

250
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:54,906
Very well.

251
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:56,040
Ren!

252
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:02,881
Hyah!

253
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:07,819
Jade--

254
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:08,887
thank me later.

255
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:10,789
And, please, call me...

256
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,056
T-girl!

257
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:13,925
And let's hear it

258
00:13:13,927 --> 00:13:16,594
for her trusty sidekick
supermoose!

259
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:17,662
Guh-huh.

260
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:18,830
So...

261
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:20,765
The talisman powers

262
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,500
reside within <i> you.</i>

263
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:27,105
Jade, no!

264
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:28,339
Horse and dog, Jackie.

265
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:29,507
I'm self-healing...

266
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:31,242
And immortal to boot.

267
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:32,644
Seize her!

268
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:34,946
Guh-huh.

269
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:36,214
Antler action!

270
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:37,348
Pow!

271
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:38,917
Bam!

272
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,328
Ooh! Uhh! Uhh...

273
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:54,999
Ooh...

274
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,534
Heartbreaker.

275
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:02,373
(Sniffing)

276
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:08,279
Whoa--

277
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,216
uhh! Hey!

278
00:14:11,218 --> 00:14:13,618
My warriors can smell
your magic.

279
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,522
Huh! Huh!

280
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:20,592
Huh! Hyah! Huh! Whoa!

281
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:22,527
Hyah! Hyah!

282
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,696
Lion!

283
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,011
And this one's
for the moose.

284
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:43,948
Aah!
- Aah!
- Aah!

285
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:46,918
Jade!

286
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,220
Heh. Had heat beams
in my eyes.

287
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,357
Huh!

288
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,659
Timber.

289
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,561
(Chanting)

290
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:01,199
All right, chi whiz.

291
00:15:01,201 --> 00:15:02,867
Are you gonna go
quietly,

292
00:15:02,869 --> 00:15:05,470
or do I have to
smoke you, too?

293
00:15:05,472 --> 00:15:06,671
Wha--

294
00:15:06,673 --> 00:15:08,339
uhh! What the hey?

295
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:10,341
I...Can't...Move!

296
00:15:10,343 --> 00:15:12,944
From the neck down
like your helpless friends,

297
00:15:12,946 --> 00:15:15,146
so that you may not
draw power

298
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:17,215
from your fingertips.

299
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:19,384
Jackie: Jade! No!

300
00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:21,986
Black: Don't make me
come over there.

301
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,623
Jade: Jackie!

302
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:34,732
(Grunting)

303
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,801
(Grunting)

304
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:39,070
Do not waste your strength.

305
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:40,672
Someone will come.

306
00:15:40,674 --> 00:15:42,974
Let us hope
it is not a wolf.

307
00:15:42,976 --> 00:15:44,375
Or a yeti.

308
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:48,313
Well, they have those
here, right?

309
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:50,181
Guh-huh.

310
00:15:50,183 --> 00:15:53,084
This is a job
for supermoose.

311
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,753
(Humming)

312
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:01,559
I told you
someone would come.

313
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,998
Let...Me...Go!

314
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,268
I had hoped to possess
the talismans,

315
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,870
but I shall instead,
like yourself,

316
00:16:12,872 --> 00:16:14,973
become them.

317
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:17,675
Yeah? Too bad you can't
get them out of me.

318
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:18,977
Can't I?

319
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:22,847
(Sniffing)

320
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:24,315
Hope he knows
where he's going.

321
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,450
Ow!

322
00:16:25,452 --> 00:16:27,285
He is born
of talisman magic!

323
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:30,254
And magic seeks magic.

324
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:38,029
(Chanting)

325
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:44,035
Supermoose:
Da da da dah ta-dah!

326
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:46,971
Antler action!

327
00:16:46,973 --> 00:16:48,106
Ohh!

328
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,609
Uhh! Gaach!

329
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:52,777
Whoa!

330
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:56,214
Gan! Ren! Chui!

331
00:16:58,584 --> 00:16:59,817
(Gasp)

332
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:06,924
Ooh, let's rumble!

333
00:17:06,926 --> 00:17:08,092
Right beside ya.

334
00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:09,160
No!

335
00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:11,329
Uncle needs
your assistance!

336
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:15,066
Jackie. Hello!

337
00:17:15,068 --> 00:17:17,568
I may be a rag doll,
but I'm still t-girl.

338
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:18,703
Ohh!

339
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,745
Booster from
the rooster.

340
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,615
My pinky!

341
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:32,016
Chihuahua!

342
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,053
(Yipping)

343
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:36,154
Cute.

344
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:40,425
Dragon blast would be nice
right about now.

345
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:44,829
But heat beam eyes will do.

346
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,467
Hand over the girl.

347
00:17:49,469 --> 00:17:51,269
Come and get me.

348
00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:52,970
(Blows raspberry)

349
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:56,841
Whoa.

350
00:17:56,843 --> 00:17:59,243
The tongue
is dragon blast. Wha--

351
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:00,645
(chanting)

352
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:02,547
T-girl!

353
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:03,948
Ohh!

354
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,349
(Chanting)

355
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:08,786
Guh-huh.

356
00:18:08,788 --> 00:18:11,022
(Repeating chant)

357
00:18:11,024 --> 00:18:12,590
(All chanting)

358
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,761
(Chanting)

359
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:19,664
(Blows raspberry)

360
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:22,200
Save your breath,
child.

361
00:18:22,202 --> 00:18:24,802
The absorption process
has begun.

362
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:27,572
(Black, uncle,
and supermoose chanting)

363
00:18:27,574 --> 00:18:29,407
(Chanting continues)

364
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:34,011
You are too late.

365
00:18:34,013 --> 00:18:36,047
I have become
the talismans--aah--

366
00:18:36,049 --> 00:18:37,148
(chanting continues)

367
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:47,792
Guh-huh.

368
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:54,332
Got my bones back.

369
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:58,936
I will have my revenge,
old man.

370
00:18:58,938 --> 00:19:00,104
Nice spell.

371
00:19:00,106 --> 00:19:03,040
All that daolon
absorbed from Jade

372
00:19:03,042 --> 00:19:05,409
was a taste of
his own dark chi.

373
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:08,613
And the talisman powers

374
00:19:08,615 --> 00:19:11,215
have returned to
their proper places.

375
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:13,751
Jade: Ohh...

376
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,124
Do we have to leave
the talismans here?

377
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:21,459
Yes, Jade,

378
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:23,027
I'm afraid that we do.

379
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:24,295
(Cell phone rings)

380
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:25,663
Black here.

381
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:26,797
Mm-hmm.

382
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,466
Mm-hmm.

383
00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:30,501
Yes, Mr. vice president.

384
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:34,872
I fired off a memo
about the talismans

385
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:36,674
before we left, and...

386
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:39,844
Let's just say
the veep's very intrigued

387
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:41,946
and wants a demonstration.

388
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,516
Jackie, I think
we should celebrate

389
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:48,386
by using
the horse talisman
to heal moosey.

390
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:53,157
The little fella
did dig us out

391
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:54,825
of a real mess, Jackie.

392
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:56,827
Seems the least
we could do.

393
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:58,029
(Sighs)

394
00:19:58,031 --> 00:19:59,964
This is the last time.

395
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:03,601
Cool!

396
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:06,971
(Gasp)

397
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:08,105
Oh, boy.

398
00:20:08,107 --> 00:20:09,974
Uh, what was
the dragon blast doing

399
00:20:09,976 --> 00:20:11,375
in the horse talisman?

400
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:12,476
(Gasp) Uncle,

401
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:14,745
I fear there has been
a mix-up.

402
00:20:14,747 --> 00:20:16,214
Hmph!

403
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:18,482
This never happened
to t-girl.

404
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:26,490
Hey, Jackie!

405
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:27,758
Yes.

406
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,127
What sorts of things
do you do to stay in shape?

407
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:32,230
Basically, training
with my stunt guy,

408
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:34,232
with my student,
3 hour a day.

409
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:35,366
Lift weight.

410
00:20:35,368 --> 00:20:37,468
Fast--choo-choo-choo
choo-choo.

411
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,636
Badminton's good.

412
00:20:38,638 --> 00:20:39,804
Almost nonstop.

413
00:20:39,806 --> 00:20:40,371
Shoo! Shoo!

414
00:20:40,373 --> 00:20:41,505
Ping-pong.

415
00:20:41,507 --> 00:20:42,840
Move your whole body.

416
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:44,575
Pah! Hah! Hah! Sha!

417
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:45,810
Also boxing.

418
00:20:45,812 --> 00:20:47,445
The rhythm--
bam-bam-bam-bam.
Bam! Bam!

419
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:49,447
Training is very
important, yes.
