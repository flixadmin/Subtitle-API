1
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:56,371
<i>People will say I am
a monster for what I've done.</i>

2
00:01:57,576 --> 00:01:59,044
<i>And maybe they're right.</i>

3
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,548
<i>I always thought
that I'd have more...</i>

4
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,838
- time.
- Dad?

5
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,586
Dad!

6
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:08,837
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

7
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:11,715
Peter?

8
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:28,983
He likes to sleep
with the light on at night.

9
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:30,734
Mary, we have to go.

10
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:35,660
Dad.

11
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,118
Be good.

12
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:52,506
I found a safe place for us to spend
the night at Lake Geneva.

13
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,726
- Are you uploading it?
- To Roosevelt. All of it.

14
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,595
Just in case we...

15
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:02,107
We're gonna be fine, Mary.

16
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,772
Did you see his face?
He's never gonna understand.

17
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,645
Mary, we've been through this.

18
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,697
Our life as we know it is over.

19
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:13,493
We're gonna spend every day
from now on looking over our shoulders.

20
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,663
Never feeling safe.
We can't do that to him.

21
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:18,661
He's just a little boy.

22
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,750
I know, I know.
But it's gonna be okay.

23
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,287
It's gonna be all right.

24
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,017
No rest for the weary, huh?

25
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:43,231
No, I'm afraid not.

26
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,483
Occupational hazard, I guess.

27
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,524
What is it you're working on?

28
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:55,327
Uh, just planning ahead.
Do you think I could speak with the pilot?

29
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:57,450
Something you need?

30
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,030
Perhaps I can help.

31
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:02,677
I'd just like to radio ahead
and make sure everything's in order

32
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:04,040
for when we land.

33
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:09,818
I think we both know
that's not an option, Dr. Parker.

34
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:26,600
Richard.

35
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,852
- They say you're a genius.
- Richard!

36
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:31,525
Not if you thought
you could escape.

37
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:32,318
Richard!

38
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:35,024
Mary!

39
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,415
Mary!

40
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,760
Mary.

41
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:05,147
It's okay. It's okay.
That's okay. It's okay.

42
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,562
I got you. I have you, okay? Okay?

43
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,193
Just gonna make you safe.

44
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,904
It's done. It's done.
Can you breathe? Mary?

45
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:15,775
- Roosevelt.
- What?

46
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,116
Roosevelt.

47
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:28,649
- It's back up. It's back up.
- Oh...

48
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:31,298
It's back up, okay? Hey, hey, hey.

49
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,752
We're gonna be all right, okay?
You stay with me.

50
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,331
Whoo!

51
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,953
Ow!

52
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,382
Yee-hee! Hoo-hoo!

53
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,265
What do you got for me today, New York?

54
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:48,431
<i>Reporting live from New York 1 chopper.</i>

55
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:51,897
<i>An Oscorp truck carrying
plutonium has been hijacked.</i>

56
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,936
<i>A police chase is in progress.</i>

57
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,559
All right. Let's get to work.

58
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,733
Say hello to Aleksei Sytsevich!

59
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,185
Spider-Man!

60
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,982
Hello, pedestrians.

61
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:55,828
Knock, knock.

62
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,833
Mr. Criminal?

63
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:01,462
Hey, my name is Spider-Man. You can call me
Web-Head, you can call me Amazing,

64
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,562
just don't call me late for dinner. You get it?

65
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,722
Not a shaker? Are you a hugger?

66
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,387
- I am killer!
- Whoa! Okay.

67
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:13,512
<i>Warning. Plutonium-238 is
a radioactive material</i>

00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:15,355
<i>and is highly explosive.</i>

69
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,326
Excuse me.

70.1

70
00:09:17,672 --> 00:09:19,676
There's more room on
the sidewalk folks, please.

71
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,566
- I got blueprints here.
- Watch it, man.

72
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:22,817
A little help?

73
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,190
A little help please!

74
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,529
You having a problem with your gun?
Let me help you out with that.

75
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,204
Whoa, coming through!

76
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:35,541
Too much work.

77
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:38,282
Oh, this is bad.

78
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:39,712
I'm gonna be right back!

79
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,252
Heads up. Watch out.

80
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:49,799
Woo! Okay, okay. There you go.

81
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:52,801
- You okay? You all right?
- You're Spider-Man.

82
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:55,349
Costume gives it away huh?
These look pretty important, Max.

83
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,438
"Max"? How do you know my name?

84
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,852
It's written on your... badge.

85
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,100
I'm a nobody.

86
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,569
Hey, you're not a nobody.
You're a somebody.

87
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:03,482
Lick that.

88
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,071
All right. Listen to me.

89
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:06,360
- Now, I need you.
- Really?

90
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,126
- You're my eyes and ears out here.
- Okay.

91
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:09,316
- All right?
- All right.

92
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:10,576
I'll see you out there!

93
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,872
<i>Warning. Violation of protocol.</i>

94
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:46,650
Hands up!

95
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:52,906
Get him, Spidey!

96
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,124
Oh, gotcha. Gotcha.
Nope, got you too.

97
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,622
Hey. No. You. Don't.
You're not going anywhere!

98
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:05,374
Come here. Come here.
Come to Daddy.

99
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:09,966
Get the hell out of the way!

100
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:13,715
Okay. Stop it! Stop it! Whew.

101
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:15,433
Oh, come on.

102
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,602
Hey, wait. Come back here.

103
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,513
Heel!

104
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:22,890
I got you.

105
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:37,824
Hey, I'm sorry, I'm running a bit late.
I got stuck in some traffic.

106
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,870
Your timing is terrible.
It started already.

107
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,459
<i>- I know, I'm sorry.</i>
- Where are you?

108
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,419
<i>1st and Broadway, 2nd and Broadway,
3rd and Broadway.</i>

109
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,254
Uh, five minutes. Ten tops.

110
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,212
- Are those sirens?
- <i>No.</i>

111
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,505
- Peter?
- <i>No.</i>

112
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,253
- Peter?
<i>- No sirens.</i>

113
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:52,929
No—

114
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:54,714
<i>Peter.</i>

115
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:56,516
<i>What is happening?</i>

116
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:57,884
<i>Peter.</i>

117
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,431
<i>Peter.</i>

118
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:05,774
<i>Hello</i>?

119
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:10,234
- Peter? Pe—
<i>- I'll be right there. Promise.</i>

120
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,860
This year's Valedictorian,
please welcome Gwen Stacy.

121
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,092
Good morning, esteemed faculty,

122
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:33,211
and families of my fellow graduates.

123
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,680
It's an honor to be
standing up here today.

124
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:43,846
Hello.

125
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,519
- Hey! Get off!
- I told you.

126
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,563
I am running a bit late.

127
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:49,402
It's over, Spider.

128
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:50,645
Really?!

129
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,863
I know we all think that we're immortal.

130
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:54,733
We're supposed to feel that way.

131
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:56,075
We're graduating.

132
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:59,988
But, like our brief
four years in high school,

133
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:02,491
what makes life valuable

134
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,868
is that it doesn't last forever.

135
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:07,541
What makes it precious is that it ends.

136
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,605
And I know that now more than ever.

137
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,635
And I say it,

138
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,383
today of all days,

139
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,265
to remind us that time is luck.

140
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,560
So don't waste it living someone else's life.

141
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:29,480
Make yours count for something.

142
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,860
Fight for what matters to you.

143
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:33,355
No matter what.

144
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,990
Because even if we fall short,

145
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:38,948
what better way is there to live?

146
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,549
I'll take that. That's not yours.

147
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:58,337
Huh?

148
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:03,559
This is not end, Spider!

149
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,061
Michael Oates.

150
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,445
Julia Orchard-Heymans.

151
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,070
Alexis Ortiz.

152
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,031
Bo Parisi.

153
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,121
Peter Parker.

154
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,502
Hey, I think I know that guy.

155
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:31,917
Peter Park...

156
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,709
I'm sorry.

157
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:50,057
Wait, do that again! Do that again!

158
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:55,107
Peter, for Lord's sakes! I almost stole
a cap and gown to run up there myself.

159
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:58,527
I'd love to have seen that. That would've
been awesome. No, no, this is for you.

160
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:00,525
- Oh, I am so proud of you!
- You earned it.

161
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:03,153
Sweetheart, I'm so proud of you.

162
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:05,992
I know the first thing
your Uncle Ben would say.

163
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,240
Yeah, I know too.

164
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:10,619
"You better hurry up, party's over.
You gotta get a job."

165
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:14,964
The second thing he would say,
"Don't just follow the path, make your own trail."

166
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:16,458
Ralph Waldo Emerson.

167
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,254
- No.
- What do you mean "no"?

168
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:20,679
Ben told me he made it up.

169
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:24,306
You really did learn something here.

170
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:29,854
I wish your uncle could have been here.

171
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,266
Yeah, me too.

172
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,435
And my folks.

173
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,400
Yeah. Yeah.

174
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:43,200
- Would've been good.
- Perfect da—

175
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,949
- All right, you can go. Go on.
- Huh?

176
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,196
I'll be right back, okay?

177
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:50,167
- Oh. Okay, guys. Get together,
get together, right now.
- Hi!

178
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,911
A quick one. All right. Cheese.

179
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:54,754
Cheese.

180
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:57,920
- Okay. I'll just be over here.
- Yeah, just give me two seconds.

181
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,759
- Don't go too far.
- It's good to see you.

182
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:01,469
- All right.
- All right.

183
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:03,345
Hey.

184
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:08,676
Did your um... Did your traffic jam
have anything to do with the Russian Mob

185
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:11,805
and machine guns by any chance?
Why didn't you just tell me?

186
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:14,056
I can't. What am I gonna do?
You're about to do your speech.

187
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,025
- Gwen, honey. Family photo.
- Yes?

188
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:17,267
Okay.

189
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,274
Hey. You coming to dim sum?

190
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,280
Can't keep me away.

191
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:22,864
It's at 8:00. Don't be late.

192
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,324
- I won't be.
- Okay.

193
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:28,905
And I'm gonna do my speech for you.

194
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,373
- All night? I wanna hear it all night long.
- I'm gonna do my speech for you.

195
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:33,664
- Over and over again, all night long.
- Okay.

196
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,578
- Oh, my gosh.
- It was pretty good.

197
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,798
Great, Peter? Join us? Come on.

198
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:44,592
I gotta find my aunt, I gotta find my aunt but uh,
I'm gonna catch up... later, thank you.

199
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,680
Hi.

200
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,268
<i>You're gonna make enemies.</i>

201
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,304
<i>People will get hurt.</i>

202
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,233
<i>So I want you to promise me something, okay?</i>

203
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:01,358
Leave Gwen out of it.

204
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:05,116
<i>Promise me that.</i>

205
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,069
She's gonna take one quick picture, okay?

206
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:23,255
Peter's outside.
I'm gonna go see if he's okay.

207
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:27,221
What are you doing? What are you...

208
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,682
Peter.

209
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:34,850
What is it?

210
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:38,394
- Hey.
- What's wrong?

211
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:39,730
Are you all right?

212
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:41,353
I don't know what I'm doing.

213
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,527
It's my father, isn't it?

214
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:47,199
Yeah.

215
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,489
I see him everywhere I go.

216
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:54,286
I can't... I don't know what to do.
And I can't get him out of my head.

217
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:57,331
- Yeah, but we've talked about this.
- I know, but Gwen...

218
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,454
- It's not his choice.
- Gwen.

219
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:03,625
I promised him that
I would keep away from you.

220
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,879
And now I'm gonna come
and eat dinner with your family.

221
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:10,264
How can I do this?
What does that—What does this make me?

222
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,758
I don't know, what does that make you?

223
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:15,387
It makes me not able to live with myself.

224
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,268
- I thought that it meant you loved me.
- I do love you.

225
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:25,650
I love you.

226
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,108
Then why isn't that enough?

227
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:30,735
Huh?

228
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:32,953
Because what if something happens to you

229
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,698
just like it happened
to him because of me?

230
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:39,122
- No. Wait, wait, wait.
- Listen. No, n—

231
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,041
I cannot let that happen.

232
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:42,918
Listen to me.

233
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:44,837
You're Spider-Man...

234
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:47,631
and I love that.

235
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:52,132
But I love Peter Parker more.

236
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:56,810
That's worth it to me.

237
00:18:58,012 --> 00:18:59,889
I can't lose you too.

238
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:04,815
If because you can't lose me,
we can't be together,

239
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,399
who does that work out for, Peter?

240
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,828
I can't. I'm sorry, Gwen.

241
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,324
Wow.

242
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:21,127
You have done this to me

243
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:25,840
again and again, Peter.

244
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:28,335
I can't live like this.

245
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,429
I break up with you.

246
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,934
I break up with you.

247
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,426
<i>Good morning, New Yorkers.</i>

248
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:21,020
<i>Looking for another
beautiful day here in the city.</i>

249
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:22,559
<i>A few clouds to start us off...</i>

250
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:26,059
<i>The steady increase in sightings of
Spider-Man has sparked a national debate</i>

251
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,686
<i>over the role of vigilantism
in American crime fighting.</i>

252
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:29,937
<i>How about that Spider-Man?</i>

253
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:32,565
<i>Last night on the Manhattan Bridge,
he saved a dozen lives.</i>

254
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:34,408
<i>We wanna hear your calls.</i>

255
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,995
<i>I think without Spider-Man,
be no hope for this city.</i>

256
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,366
<i>Who do you think pays the bills
for all the damages he causes, huh?</i>

257
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:42,707
It's you and me, taxpayers.

258
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,497
- You make this?
- Yeah.

259
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,624
This is a wind turbine.

260
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:49,294
You made this? No way.

261
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:50,966
This is amazing.

262
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:53,673
It's good as new, right?

263
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:55,805
I'll walk you home.

264
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,848
- What's your name?
- Jorge.

265
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,309
Jorge? I'm Spider-Man.

266
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:03,475
<i>I don't feel like my kids
are safe with him out there.</i>

267
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:06,565
<i>Get out of the way
and let the police do their job.</i>

268
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:10,607
<i>Some folks think that there
might be more than one Spider-Man.</i>

269
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:13,401
<i>What do you think?</i>

270
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,320
<i>One guy or many?</i>

271
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:18,410
<i>I'd love to know
who's behind that mask.</i>

272
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:19,653
Hey.

273
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:21,372
- Nice outfit.
- Thanks.

274
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:24,774
<i>We have a caller on the line named Max.
He says he knows Spider-Man.</i>

275
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,829
<i>Listen, I'm upset. Spider-Man
to me, is being misunderstood.</i>

276
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:30,422
<i>He's a very, very good person.
He's protecting us.</i>

277
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:32,883
<i>Not only that, but
he saved my life one time.</i>

278
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,365
<i>We sort of became best friends.</i>

279
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:37,463
How much?

280
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:38,930
Hey, you're that spider guy!

281
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:40,299
I'm Spider-Man.

282
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:41,716
Huh?

283
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:47,147
I'm Spider-Man.

284
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:50,268
<i>This Spider-Man guy... He's not
the police, he's not</i> a <i>fireman.</i>

285
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:53,317
<i>What gives him the right to get
involved in other people's business?</i>

286
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:26,433
Peter, honey?

287
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:28,605
Can I come in?

288
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,600
No!

289
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:33,899
Peter, the final starts at 9, honey.

290
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,230
And you said you would
take my car into the shop

291
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,948
because it keeps dying, remember?

292
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,114
Give me a second, Aunt May! I'm gonna
get the door, just give me a second.

293
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,158
Peter, please just let me in. All right?

294
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:44,405
I'm trying to get my...

295
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:47,829
You said your final was at 9, and
you're gonna take my car into the shop.

296
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:50,749
No! You can't come in. I'm so naked.

297
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:56,627
Peter! For goodness sakes, you said you're gonna
take my car into the shop because it kee—

298
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:59,846
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. I'm okay.

299
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:01,213
I'm just...

300
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,007
I'm very naked right now.

301
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,475
What happened to your face? It's filthy.

302
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,807
- It is?
- Yes.

303
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,852
Oh, yeah, yeah, I was cleaning the chimney.

304
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:12,941
We have no chimney.

305
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,477
What?

306
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:16,195
- You're late.
- I know, I'm late.

307
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:18,064
- Downstairs, now.
- I can't.

308
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:21,067
- Can you leave? Because I'm naked here.
- All right, I'm leaving.

309
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:24,699
- Morning, I love you.
- I love you too. Hurry up.

310
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:08,038
Whoa. Well, look who's here.

311
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,452
Spidey.

312
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:11,284
How was your morning?

313
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:13,627
Aces, Max. Aces.

314
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,871
I've been out saving the world.

315
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:17,460
Protecting everybody.

316
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:20,459
But is someone celebrating a birthday today?

317
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:24,012
That's why you're here.

318
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:26,178
You remembered my birthday.

319
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,599
All the crime-fighting you've
been doing, and all of a sudden,

320
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,849
you take time out to come visit
little old me, Max. It's amazing to...

321
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:37,901
But, of course you would.

322
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,653
Why wouldn't you visit me?

323
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:41,735
We're best friends.

324
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:48,071
What are you doing?
You made me a cake?

325
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,520
People don't get a chance to see these
small, kind things that you do for people.

326
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,538
I know what they say
about you in the press

327
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:55,912
but it doesn't matter to me
because I know the real you.

328
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,754
Because you're amazing.

329
00:24:57,997 --> 00:25:01,046
Wow. That's what the press needs.

330
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:04,135
They should call you
The Amazing Spider-Man.

331
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,221
You like that, Spidey?

332
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,386
I like it a lot, Max.

333
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:11,310
Good. Because today

334
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:13,099
is going to be...

335
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,346
Amazing.

336
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:18,108
Yeah. Circuit 39.

337
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:24,982
I'm not late, Harvey.
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

338
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:28,202
I just wanna know if you
can find another waitress

339
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:32,122
to replace me because I start
my training rounds at the hospital.

340
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,913
And don't mention this to Peter.
I don't want him to know.

341
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:36,456
Because he'll worry.

342
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:39,080
Uh, yeah. Yeah. Okay, you got it.

343
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:40,876
Uh, double shift on Thursday.

344
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:42,628
Okay, bye.

345
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:47,133
- Who was that?
- Harvey.

346
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:51,426
- Doing a double shift, huh?
- Sometimes.

347
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,928
Got nothing else to do. I like the girls.

348
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:57,557
I miss Ben. Gives me
a little extra in the cookie jar.

349
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:02,986
Well, I sold another couple of photos
to the Bugle, so that ought to help.

350
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:06,323
Yeah, it would really help if
that guy would pay you a fair wage.

351
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,033
Oh, Jameson. Jameson pays me a fair wage.

352
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:10,619
If it was 1961, he pays me a fair wage.

353
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:14,286
Hey, wait. What are you doing?
What are you doing? No, I do the laundry.

354
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:16,533
- I'm doing my laundry.
- No, I do the laundry.

355
00:26:16,784 --> 00:26:20,288
No, this is my job. I've been doing
your laundry since you were 6 years old.

356
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:22,164
I understand that. I'm in college now.

357
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:25,133
I think it's time that I took care
of my own dirty underwear.

358
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:27,935
Last time you did the laundry,
you turned everything blue and red

359
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:29,129
- so no!
- That was a mistake.

360
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:32,383
Because I was washing
the... American flag.

361
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:35,682
- My... Can I please just...?
- No one washes a flag.

362
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:36,968
I do, and I won't anymore.

363
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:39,181
- Forget it. Fine. Can I  just do my—it's just underwear!
- This is my machine.

364
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,854
This is my laundry, my home, my machine.

365
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:43,398
Back off, eat your breakfast.

366
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:48,281
All right, laundry sheriff.
I'll do it later.

367
00:26:48,524 --> 00:26:49,867
- I'll do it.
- No, forget it.

368
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:51,907
- Give it to me.
- No, I'll do it some other time.

369
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:54,570
Hey. Excuse me.

370
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,872
Jerk.

371
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:58,992
Not gonna make it.

372
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:04,665
Logjam. Come on, come on, come on.

373
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,797
- Watch it, buddy.
- Hey, let's go.

374
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:13,925
<i>Oscorp Industries</i>

375
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:18,600
<i>is proud to announce the world's
first electromagnetic power grid.</i>

376
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:23,184
<i>By converting aging power stations
into a field of hydroelectric towers,</i>

377
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:26,937
<i>we are generating clean,
green, sustainable energy</i>

378
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:29,656
<i>to power Manhattan,

379
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:32,196
<i>and eventually the world

380
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:35,446
Dillon. You're late.
Doggone trains are so slow, sir.

381
00:27:35,696 --> 00:27:37,539
Don't you realize that
Oscorp is now responsible

382
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:39,328
for the entire city's
energy supply?

383
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:41,543
I submitted a lot of designs
for the power grid

384
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:43,913
and they used a lot of them,
and I noticed that,

385
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:46,666
and those power grids
were designed by me.

386
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:48,166
You designed them?

387
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:50,468
Sure you did.

388
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:52,216
And I'm Spider-Man.

389
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:55,508
You're no Spider-Man!
He's a Leo, you're a Sagittarius!

390
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:58,886
You besmirch him again, I'm gonna
rip your well-groomed head off!

391
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:01,104
Now, get to work.

392
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,562
<i>What floor, please?</i>

393
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:07,111
- Seventy four.
- <i>Thank you.</i>

394
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:08,645
Oh, hold that!

395
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:11,111
- Can you hold that, please?
- I got it.

396
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,324
Thank you, you're a real gentleman.

397
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:15,365
Most people would have
just let those close.

398
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:17,238
Yeah, well most people
don't notice other people.

399
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:19,865
- <i>What floor, please?</i>
- Um, ahem... Sixty-three...

400
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,708
I got it. I got it. What is it?

401
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:22,997
Uh, sixty-three.

402
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,128
Sixty-three, please.

403
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,417
- <i>Thank you.</i>
- In a hurry.

404
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,882
Thank you very much.

405
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:34,925
Um... I'm Max. Max Dillon.

406
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:36,515
I'm Gwen.

407
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:38,555
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

408
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:41,012
Is it your birthday?

409
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:46,229
Oh. Oh yeah, uh... well, I, uh...
They... uh, friends of mine made this flyer up.

410
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:48,318
I'm having... a birthday
party at the big club.

411
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,028
- A lot of celebrities.
- Wow.

412
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:53,319
Would love to invite you,
it's just that the guest list is closed.

413
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:56,739
Oh, got it. Got it.
Well, thank you anyway.

414
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,745
- That's exciting.
- <i>This guy, dressed up like Spider-Man</i>

415
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:00,201
<i>hanging out near the blaze.</i>

416
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:03,872
It must be cool, huh? To have
the whole world look at you like that?

417
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:07,337
You know, Spider-Man
saved my life one time.

418
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:11,667
Out of all the people
in the whole city, he saved me.

419
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:13,551
He said he needed me.

420
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:16,805
That must be a good feeling.

421
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,345
<i>Sixty-third floor.</i>

422
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:21,844
Oh. It was nice to meet you, Max.

423
00:29:24,805 --> 00:29:26,557
Wait. She remembered my name.

424
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,250
Welcome home.

425
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:58,676
It's dark in there.

426
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:01,008
Your eyes will adjust.

427
00:30:02,676 --> 00:30:04,178
It's better this way.

428
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:34,545
Dad.

429
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:44,222
This is not how I imagined I would die.

430
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:49,644
Looking at my son
and seeing a stranger.

431
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:54,565
You have such potential, Harry.

432
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:58,490
Such fierce intelligence,

433
00:30:58,732 --> 00:31:00,575
and you're throwing it all away.

434
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,819
No, you threw me away.

435
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:08,242
You kicked me off to
boarding school when I was 11.

436
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:12,045
On my 16th birthday,

437
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:14,005
you sent me Scotch.

438
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:16,341
Or one of your assistants did.

439
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:19,424
I'm pretty sure because the card read:

440
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:24,054
"With compliments, Norman Osborn."

441
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:28,770
I don't expect forgiveness from you anymore.

442
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,607
I don't believe in miracles.

443
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:35,568
How could you possibly understand

444
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:39,611
that your childhood
had to be sacrificed

445
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:41,608
for something greater?

446
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:44,282
And not just for me.

447
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:45,953
For you!

448
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:51,160
Has your hand started to twitch yet?

449
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:56,707
When you lay awake and you feel it coming,

450
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:59,760
hiding under your skin,

451
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:03,092
waiting to show itself.

452
00:32:03,964 --> 00:32:08,723
To show you who you really are.

453
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:15,521
Retroviral hyperplasia.

454
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,817
I never told you...

455
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:23,074
that it's genetic.

456
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:26,741
Our disease,

457
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:30,074
the Osborn curse.

458
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:33,460
And it began at your age.

459
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,246
Let me see it.

460
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:40,337
Your hand. Give it to me.

461
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:53,931
The greatest inheritance
I can give you isn't merely money.

462
00:32:54,181 --> 00:32:55,182
It's this.

463
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:59,357
A sum total of all my work.

464
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:03,574
Everything I did to stay alive.

465
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:08,528
Maybe you could succeed where I failed.

466
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:36,728
<i>It's just in, Norman Osborn, the legendary
founder and CEO of Oscorp Industries has died,</i>

467
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:38,646
<i>the Osborn estate has confirmed.</i>

468
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:41,190
<i>He is survived by his
only son, Harry Osborn</i>

469
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:44,280
<i>who is the sole heir
of the Oscorp corporate empire.</i>

470
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:45,740
Harry.

471
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:49,202
<i>Osborn fundamentally changed the medical
profession's approach to human healing</i>

472
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:51,830
<i>and affected the lives of millions.</i>

473
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:56,535
<i>I started Oscorp because I looked at
the world around me and I thought:</i>

474
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:59,254
<i>“We can do better.
And we should do better."</i>

475
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:04,878
<i>Einstein said, “The world cannot be
changed without changing our thinking."</i>

476
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:07,629
<i>But change isn't just a slogan.</i>

477
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:09,764
<i>It begins with hard work.</i>

478
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:13,431
<i>Change begins with
persistence and commitment.</i>

479
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:17,184
Mr. Osborn changed the world.

480
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:21,685
And now it's up to each of us to ensure
that his hopes and dreams remain alive.

481
00:34:22,043 --> 00:34:23,144
But not today.

482
00:34:24,304 --> 00:34:25,730
Today is for mourning.

483
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:28,109
- Hello?
<i>- Is this Gwen Stacy?</i>

484
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:29,484
Yes, it is. Who's calling?

485
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:33,534
<i>I'm calling from the Oxford Scholars
Program. We have some exciting news.</i>

486
00:34:38,285 --> 00:34:40,913
- Whoa, Dillon. You stay here.
- What?

487
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:44,082
There's a current flow problem in the genomics lab.
Why don't you stay and take a look at that?

488
00:34:44,124 --> 00:34:46,764
It is my birthday. Everybody else
is leaving. Why do I have to stay?

489
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:49,304
- Because you're special.
- Smythe.

490
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:50,923
I mean, Mr. Smythe.

491
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:52,720
Happy birthday.

492
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:02,897
<i>The generation of electricity
by living organisms to fend off...</i>

493
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:05,193
Let's see what's going
on with you. Hey guys.

494
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:06,637
<i>The genetically manipulated...</i>

495
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:08,523
At least somebody's partying.

496
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,360
All right. Just a little sick.

497
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:14,947
Mm-hm. I got your medicine, though.

498
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:19,626
I'm so sick that I can't get to my birthday
after all I put together for this company.

499
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:20,915
Designed the grid...

500
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,810
I should've stretched.

501
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,629
<i>- Malfunction in Sector 5A.</i>
- I know. Just a little indigestion.

502
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:29,378
I bet you didn't know it was
my birthday huh, did you, Kari?

503
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:31,596
Think you can sing
"Happy Birthday" for me?

504
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,806
I'll just have to sing it for myself.

505
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:35,300
- Gilbert?
<i>- What?</i>

506
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:39,054
It's Max. Can we shut down uh...
power on Sector uh... 32, please?

507
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:40,430
<i>Forget it. I'm out the door.</i>

508
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,480
What do you mean? Listen,
I'm up here. It's dangerous.

509
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:44,067
<i>- Sorry, Max.</i>
- Hello?

510
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:49,899
Fine. I'll do it myself.
And sing my birthday song too.

511
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:51,866
This is crazy.

00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:55,597
Harry,

519
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:57,682
Oscorp's been under
intense public scrutiny

520
00:36:57,924 --> 00:37:01,435
in the wake of Dr. Connors'
recent uh... breach of trust.

521
00:37:01,678 --> 00:37:03,021
You mean people are pissed off

522
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:06,187
because he tried to turn everyone
in New York City into giant lizards.

523
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,686
Given that,

524
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:13,361
all the animal hybrid programs
he was involved in were destroyed

525
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:15,859
to restore investor confidence.

526
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:19,704
Ah. That is the Osborn way.

527
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:23,541
Whatever's inconvenient around
here just get rid of it, right?

528
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:27,292
Much of that scrutiny
may fall on you now.

529
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:30,670
We felt that plausible
deniability was your best option.

530
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,667
Sure, sure. I get it.

531
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:35,174
Twenty-year-old kid.

532
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,096
Two hundred billion dollar company.

533
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:38,931
What was Dad thinking?

534
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:41,684
I mean, you're all lawyers right?

535
00:37:43,603 --> 00:37:47,353
Surely, someone must've
questioned his sanity in the end.

536
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,728
Someone must've thought about having
him declared legally incompetent.

537
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:53,196
It would've made this
conversation a lot easier.

538
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:55,736
- Harry.
- It's Mr. Osborn.

539
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:59,115
We're not friends.

540
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:05,830
Hi.

541
00:38:10,497 --> 00:38:12,591
You were his assistant, right?

542
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,051
Mm-hm.

543
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:17,553
What's your name?

544
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:19,465
Felicia.

545
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:20,886
Felicia.

546
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:26,767
From now on, everybody
at this table works for Felicia

547
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:30,563
because Felicia works for me.

548
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:33,900
Would anybody like to speak up?

549
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:39,526
Well, good. Then you can
all keep your jobs a little longer.

550
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:44,163
Sir, there's a Peter Parker here to see you.

551
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:55,591
Felicia, I wanna see
every file on this list.

552
00:38:57,252 --> 00:38:58,845
Every single one.

553
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:07,895
Peter Parker.

554
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:11,266
It's like seeing a ghost.

555
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:13,769
Hey, Harry.

556
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:15,819
Random.

557
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:18,649
- What, 10 years.
- It's eight.

558
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:21,242
But, you're close.

559
00:39:22,402 --> 00:39:23,574
What's up?

560
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,913
I saw the news, man.

561
00:39:26,573 --> 00:39:29,372
I heard about your dad
and I wanted to come and...

562
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:33,622
Just wanted to come and see you.
Check to see how you were doing.

563
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,374
I'm with some people.

564
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:41,129
I'm in a...

565
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:42,923
I'm in a meeting.

566
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:44,765
I'm sorry, I don't wanna intrude.

567
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:46,510
I know it's been a long time.

568
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:49,809
I kind of know exactly what
you're going through right now.

569
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:52,648
And you were so there
for me when my parents...

570
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,985
Well, that's why I'm here for you.

571
00:39:56,686 --> 00:39:57,812
Thank you.

572
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:01,904
Ah, it's good to see you, man.

573
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,612
It's good to see you.

574
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,406
I'm sorry about your dad.

575
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,537
You got your braces off.

576
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:20,878
Now there's nothing to
distract from your unibrow.

577
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,802
There he is.

578
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:28,380
There he is.

579
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:30,804
You still blow-dry
your hair every morning?

580
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:35,776
Um, you know, one of my
manservants holds the hair dryer

581
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:37,815
but I work the comb, okay?

582
00:40:38,061 --> 00:40:42,066
So, at least I'm not completely helpless.

583
00:40:42,315 --> 00:40:44,317
You're stupid.

584
00:40:50,073 --> 00:40:53,202
After graduation, I went
to Brazil, then Singapore.

585
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:54,452
- That's right, yeah.
- Yeah.

586
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,500
And then Europe.
You know, I went to Europe.

587
00:40:56,746 --> 00:40:57,872
I saw you.

588
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:00,042
What do you mean, you saw me?

589
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,451
I saw you in some magazine
with some French supermodel.

590
00:41:02,669 --> 00:41:04,421
You know what I'm talking about?

591
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:06,344
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

592
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:09,342
Dude, that whole model
thing is so exhausting.

593
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:10,889
I know.

594
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:16,565
What? You got a lady?

595
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:20,194
Uh...

596
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:22,905
That's a question.

597
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:25,449
That's a question.

598
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:26,944
Whoa, buddy.

599
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:29,537
No, I don't.

600
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:31,702
Yeah.

601
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,166
I don't know. It's, uh...

602
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:39,547
I don't know. It's complicated.

603
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:41,632
Yeah, I don't do complicated.

604
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:46,595
Uh, what's her name? Who is she?

605
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:47,964
Her name's Gwen.

606
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,886
Gwen Stacy.

607
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:53,390
- Gwen Stacy.
- She works for you.

608
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:55,104
Really? She works for me?

609
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:58,646
- At Oscorp, she does work-study at Oscorp.
- Wow. Is she a model employee?

610
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,857
You know, when my father sent me away

611
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:05,983
I tried to forget
everything about this place.

612
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:10,404
I guess that kind of included you.

613
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:16,034
You ain't gotta explain
anything to me, man.

614
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:19,329
We both got dumped.

615
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:25,335
You ever figure out
why your parents bailed?

616
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:31,094
My dad left a briefcase.

617
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:34,098
That's all I got,
briefcase full of junk.

618
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:36,687
Whatever. I don't know.
I try not to think about it.

619
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:38,681
How's that working out for you?

620
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:40,725
Perfectly.

621
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:49,109
Dude. Nice arm.

622
00:42:49,776 --> 00:42:51,995
It's just the wrist.
It's just all in the wrist, buddy.

623
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:54,409
<i>You could do it too
if you just strengthened up that.</i>

624
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:55,956
<i>Yeah, right.</i>

625
00:42:56,491 --> 00:42:59,711
<i>You gotta admit, though. Things
have gotten crazy around here, man.</i>

626
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:02,046
<i>Giant lizards</i>

627
00:43:02,622 --> 00:43:04,545
and spider guys.

628
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:09,470
Just one guy. Just one spider man.

629
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:13,012
Or woman. We don't know for sure.

630
00:43:13,466 --> 00:43:17,346
Whatever, dude. He wears spandex
to rescue kittens from trees.

631
00:43:18,221 --> 00:43:19,689
I'm so impressed.

632
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:22,025
I kind of like to think
he gives people hope.

633
00:43:22,642 --> 00:43:23,894
For what?

634
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:26,862
Maybe eventually
everything's gonna be all right.

635
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:29,483
Yeah, I just wish
I had time for "eventually."

636
00:43:33,653 --> 00:43:34,825
Who was he?

637
00:43:35,071 --> 00:43:37,824
Maxwell Dillon.
Electrical engineer.

638
00:43:38,658 --> 00:43:40,831
No associates or friends to speak of.

639
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:44,419
He submitted specs for
the grid that we appropriated.

640
00:43:44,664 --> 00:43:47,754
The guy was invisible.

641
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:52,593
Wall Street's nervous enough
with that child Harry, taking over.

642
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:54,841
We've gotta find a way to get him out.

643
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:58,262
In the meantime, if the press
gets hold of this accident,

644
00:43:58,511 --> 00:43:59,728
our stock will crater.

645
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:03,817
So make sure this
Mr. Dillon stays invisible.

646
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:08,445
This could prove useful
for us in the future.

647
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:16,672

660
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:12,149
I'm sorry for the spontaneous
outreach. It was kind of...

661
00:46:12,395 --> 00:46:14,864
No. I don't... I... spontaneous...

662
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:17,233
is all right. You know.

663
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:19,952
Well, I just figured it was time.

664
00:46:21,237 --> 00:46:22,284
You know?

665
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:24,453
Time that we try to be friends.

666
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:27,117
Yeah.

667
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:31,209
Friends. Yeah. That's...

668
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:33,332
great.

669
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:35,835
I just don't want us to be complicated.

670
00:46:36,085 --> 00:46:38,258
I was just saying that
to someone. I hate complicated.

671
00:46:38,671 --> 00:46:40,093
Keep it simple.

672
00:46:41,382 --> 00:46:44,056
Okay. Great, great.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right.

673
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:45,554
Well, I mean...

674
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:52,690
If we're gonna be friends, I think
we gotta establish some ground rules.

675
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:54,858
Some ground rules?
Yeah, some ground rules.

676
00:46:56,104 --> 00:46:56,822
Like that.

677
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:58,281
Like what?

678
00:46:59,692 --> 00:47:01,786
- That laugh. That laugh.
- What?

679
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:03,575
That's off the table.

680
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:05,619
- My laugh is off the table?
- That laugh is off the table.

681
00:47:05,865 --> 00:47:07,913
You gotta figure out
a more annoying laugh.

682
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:12,251
That's still adorable.

683
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:14,999
- That was not adorable.
- It's adorable.

684
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:16,466
No, it's not adorable.

685
00:47:16,709 --> 00:47:19,383
- Okay, I have a ground rule. Um...
- Oh, good.

686
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:21,175
- What is it?
- Uh...

687
00:47:21,422 --> 00:47:23,766
Don't tell me that I look amazing.

688
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:28,058
With your big brown doe eyes. Okay?

689
00:47:28,888 --> 00:47:31,107
I'm really serious about that one.

690
00:47:32,433 --> 00:47:34,310
- Oh, no.
- What?

691
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,403
I just figured out
the next ground rule.

692
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:37,771
What?

693
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:39,524
No more of this.

694
00:47:39,774 --> 00:47:41,776
No more of this little
nose rub that you do.

695
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:43,573
- This?
- Don't think I haven't—Hey.

696
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:46,538
What am I supposed to do?
It's allergy season.

697
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:48,203
This is killing me.

698
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:50,952
You're just spitting in the face
of my ground rules. I'm out.

699
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:52,454
Come on.

700
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:56,461
First we get ice cream, and then I'm out.

701
00:48:35,371 --> 00:48:36,543
Um, yeah. So I did that.

702
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:41,670
And I got completely addicted to
this place that has Korean meatballs.

703
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:44,593
- Yeah. No, I know.
- Have you been there? It's mind-blowing.

704
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:47,217
That place on 6th. I know.
You love it there.

705
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:51,687
How do you know that?

706
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:56,563
- Hm?
- How do you know I love it there?

707
00:48:57,435 --> 00:48:58,527
Because, um...

708
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:02,402
Because you told me.

709
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:07,702
It just opened last month.

710
00:49:11,532 --> 00:49:13,284
Have you been following me?

711
00:49:18,873 --> 00:49:20,125
I knew it.

712
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:22,001
How often?

713
00:49:25,713 --> 00:49:27,090
Just once a day.

714
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:28,682
Sometimes.

715
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:32,766
Sometimes more.

716
00:49:37,266 --> 00:49:38,893
Oh, boy.

717
00:49:39,268 --> 00:49:40,394
Why?

718
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:46,487
Make sure I'm safe?

719
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,202
- And...
- And what?

720
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:52,870
And because it's the closest
I can get to still being with you.

721
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:07,217
I'm moving to England.

722
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:16,847
What?

723
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:18,808
Yeah. Um...

724
00:50:19,225 --> 00:50:22,855
I have a... I'm up for
a scholarship to Oxford.

725
00:50:24,063 --> 00:50:27,112
In molecular medicine. And it's
between me and this other kid.

726
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:29,235
There's this oral exam
that we have to do

727
00:50:29,485 --> 00:50:32,238
and he's, like, a freshman
in college, but he's 14.

728
00:50:32,488 --> 00:50:34,365
And... um...
And it's... It could be him.

729
00:50:34,615 --> 00:50:36,413
But it might be me. I hope it's me.

730
00:50:36,659 --> 00:50:39,959
And I'm thinking that I'm going too—
that I'll be moving to England.

731
00:50:41,205 --> 00:50:43,173
- Wow.
- Yeah.

732
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:45,175
And I'm really excited.

733
00:50:46,627 --> 00:50:47,924
That's, uh...

734
00:50:51,215 --> 00:50:52,512
England.

735
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:56,679
What?

736
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:55,120
Station, I need a 10-85.

737
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:58,411
Send out additional units to
the south-end corner of Duffy Square.

738
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:00,500
Folks, could you step to the side?

739
00:52:00,743 --> 00:52:02,871
Everybody get out of the way
please! Get out of the way!

740
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:06,749
Sir, get your hands away
from the cables right now!

741
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:09,919
Sir! Get your hands away from the cables!

742
00:52:10,169 --> 00:52:12,137
Let me see your hands, please!

743
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:15,181
You stay right where you are!

744
00:52:15,424 --> 00:52:16,641
Do not move!

745
00:52:16,884 --> 00:52:19,012
Freeze! Get down! On the ground!

746
00:52:36,779 --> 00:52:38,531
Get down on the ground, now!

747
00:52:38,781 --> 00:52:39,782
Stop!

748
00:52:40,032 --> 00:52:41,454
Get your ass down on the ground! Now!

749
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,373
- It's not my fault!
- Sir!

750
00:52:43,619 --> 00:52:45,179
- Stop!
- I'm gonna need for you

751
00:52:45,204 --> 00:52:46,922
- Please!
- to get down on the ground, now!

752
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:50,338
For your own safety and the safety
of the other patrons in this area.

753
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:54,258
Oh, my gosh.

754
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:58,308
They see me. You see me.

755
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:01,812
You see me.

756
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:03,897
They see me.

757
00:53:16,068 --> 00:53:17,945
- No! No! Stop!
- On the ground now!

758
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:20,823
- Don't do that! Please!
- It's over, freak!

759
00:53:21,073 --> 00:53:23,371
Wait! It's not my fault.

760
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:24,659
It's not my fault!

761
00:53:27,955 --> 00:53:29,002
I said stop!

762
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:38,119
I'm glad you're not one of
those cops that rides a horse.

763
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:47,357
All team members, hold
your fire and wait for my call.

764
00:53:50,811 --> 00:53:54,315
All units, hold your fire!
I repeat, hold your fire! Stand down!</i>

765
00:53:56,734 --> 00:53:58,361
Stop. Stop it!

766
00:53:58,610 --> 00:53:59,736
Yo, Sparkles!

767
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:02,660
Hey, how you doing?

768
00:54:03,866 --> 00:54:06,164
- It's you?
- Yeah, I know it's me.

769
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:07,410
Who are you?

770
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:10,330
You don't remember me?

771
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:12,712
No. Should I?

772
00:54:13,459 --> 00:54:16,759
I walked into the street. The car
almost hit me. You swooped me up.

773
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:18,426
You saved me.

774
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:20,345
You said you needed me.

775
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:23,265
- You're the guy with the blueprints.
- Yes.

776
00:54:23,719 --> 00:54:24,720
Blueprints.

777
00:54:25,137 --> 00:54:29,859
Yes, I remember you. Of course
I remember you. You're my eyes and ears!

778
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,899
- Uh, what's your name again?
- How could you forget me?

779
00:54:33,145 --> 00:54:35,568
- Oh, I do. I know it, I know it, don't tell me.
- It's Max.

780
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:37,612
- Is it "Max"?
- Yes.

781
00:54:37,858 --> 00:54:39,781
I'm sorry I didn't
recognize you with the...

782
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,703
You look different.

783
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:43,413
How are you?

784
00:54:43,781 --> 00:54:45,499
I don't know what's going on with me.

785
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:47,792
I can see that. I can... I believe you.

786
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:53,333
It's strange. The power I feel, I got so much...

787
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:55,501
I got so much anger.

788
00:54:55,751 --> 00:54:58,504
I can see that. I can see you don't
wanna be here and I see you're scared.

789
00:54:58,754 --> 00:55:00,514
I see you don't know
what's happening to you.

790
00:55:00,756 --> 00:55:02,508
I can see that you
don't want to hurt anybody.

791
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:05,352
- It's gonna be all right.
- Got a clear shot. Standing by.

792
00:55:05,594 --> 00:55:07,554
- I don't want them shooting me anymore.
- They're not gonna shoot you.

793

<i>You're looking at the world's

01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:28,217
<i>The hope is to extract
the venom from their glands</i>

<i>and turn that into a cure.</i>

<i>And if I can be cured, imagine
what this could do for other diseases</i>

<i>like Alzheimer's, even cancer.</i>

923
01:05:45,233 --> 01:05:48,032
They never made it to human trials.

924
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:51,991
It's 14 years of research,
and nothing to show for it.

925
01:05:55,243 --> 01:05:56,460
Except maybe this.

926
01:06:04,586 --> 01:06:06,088
Spider-Man.

927
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:08,340
What about him?

928
01:06:09,007 --> 01:06:12,011
He was bitten by one of
those things, and it worked.

929
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:16,265
I don't know how and
I don't know why but...

930
01:06:16,848 --> 01:06:20,148
He can do everything else a spider can,

931
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:22,521
including self-heal.

932
01:06:22,896 --> 01:06:24,489
I need to find him.

933
01:06:25,273 --> 01:06:26,866

934
01:06:42,373 --> 01:06:43,750
You need...

935
01:06:44,792 --> 01:06:47,011
Spider-Man's blood?

936
01:06:50,590 --> 01:06:52,638
It'll save my life.

937
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:54,978
It may not, Harry.

938
01:06:55,512 --> 01:06:57,560
It may not be that simple.

939
01:06:57,805 --> 01:06:59,565
You saw what happened
to Curt Connors, right?

940
01:06:59,807 --> 01:07:00,808
Connors was weak.

941
01:07:01,476 --> 01:07:03,319
This is me, Peter.

942
01:07:03,561 --> 01:07:05,655
I don't think you can
just set up an event

943
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:07,815
and have him donate.

944
01:07:08,066 --> 01:07:13,288
I mean, I'm sure he's sensitive
about people shoving needles and...

945
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:14,656
Ah he's sensitive, okay.

946
01:07:15,156 --> 01:07:19,912
Well then, maybe you could just
sensitively tell me where he is,

947
01:07:20,161 --> 01:07:22,459
and I will go ask him myself.

948
01:07:23,081 --> 01:07:24,081
What?

949
01:07:27,001 --> 01:07:28,969
- You took his picture.
- So?

950
01:07:29,587 --> 01:07:31,214
- You know him.
- Harry,

951
01:07:31,464 --> 01:07:36,226
I took a picture from a long way away.
I used a long lens. I don't know him.

952
01:07:38,555 --> 01:07:41,024
I put together what you said at the river.

953
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:45,312
- What I—
- About how he gives people hope.

954
01:07:47,438 --> 01:07:48,735
Come on.

955
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:03,542
What in the...?

956
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:10,048
Just say yes.

957
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:18,887
Don't turn your back on me!

958
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:22,686
I don't wanna end up
like my father, Peter.

959
01:08:24,392 --> 01:08:25,814
Please.

960
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:29,030
Peter, please.

961
01:08:29,272 --> 01:08:30,649
I can't.

962
01:08:34,652 --> 01:08:35,699
Please.

963
01:08:40,533 --> 01:08:44,712
I'm gonna try and find Spider-Man.

964
01:08:55,006 --> 01:08:56,726
Hey, what's security doing over here?

965
01:08:56,758 --> 01:08:57,759
That's so weird.

966
01:08:58,009 --> 01:08:59,009
She's right over there.

967
01:09:06,309 --> 01:09:07,777
Hey! Miss Stacy!

968
01:09:24,035 --> 01:09:25,036
Hi.

969
01:09:25,286 --> 01:09:26,538
Hi.

970
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:28,168
What are you doing here?

971
01:09:28,706 --> 01:09:30,333
- What are you doing here?
- Oh.

972
01:09:32,126 --> 01:09:33,298
Come here.

973
01:09:40,093 --> 01:09:41,936
She's not here. Check another floor.

974
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:43,725
- Got it.
- Yes, sir!

975
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:45,018
You're in trouble.

976
01:09:45,264 --> 01:09:46,436
- Yeah.
- Who's that guy?

977
01:09:46,683 --> 01:09:49,444
There was an accident in the genomics
lab, and they're covering it up.

978
01:09:49,686 --> 01:09:52,940
And I found out. That guy
from Times Square last night?

979
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:56,363
I met him. He was an electrical
engineer in the building.

980
01:09:56,609 --> 01:09:59,579
And he loved Spider-Man by the way.
He was like, a fanatic.

981
01:09:59,821 --> 01:10:03,451
I didn't get love vibes. I got more of a
"want to kill me with his electricity" vibe.

982
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:05,748
That's actually kind of
what it's like to love you.

983
01:10:06,953 --> 01:10:10,048
I was searching for him in the
computer and all the files, he's erased.

984
01:10:10,289 --> 01:10:11,541
- My God.
- He's completely erased.

985
01:10:11,791 --> 01:10:12,963
That's Oscorp.

986
01:10:14,001 --> 01:10:15,173
And what about you?
Why are you here?

987
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:16,421
Harry.

988
01:10:16,671 --> 01:10:18,139
- Osborn?
- He's dying.

989
01:10:18,715 --> 01:10:19,932
- What do you mean?
- He's dying.

990
01:10:20,174 --> 01:10:22,597
And he thinks the only thing
that's gonna save his life

991
01:10:22,969 --> 01:10:25,518
is my blood, is Spider-Man's blood.

992
01:10:25,763 --> 01:10:28,232
And as far as I know, if I
give it to him, it could kill him.

993
01:10:28,474 --> 01:10:30,272
Or something worse.

994
01:10:30,935 --> 01:10:32,061
I know.

995
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:34,780
This is the maintenance closet, Gwen.

996
01:10:35,314 --> 01:10:38,193
This is the most clichéd
hiding place you could've chosen.

997
01:10:38,443 --> 01:10:40,411
- This is the stupidest hiding place.
- I'm sorry.

998
01:10:40,653 --> 01:10:44,624
I didn't take us to
the Bahamas of hiding places.

999
01:10:44,866 --> 01:10:48,621
I gotta talk to you about England
I guess, because I don't...

1000
01:10:58,337 --> 01:11:01,432
- You just kissed me.
- I know, I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.

1001
01:11:02,383 --> 01:11:03,475
How'd you like it?

1002
01:11:03,968 --> 01:11:05,311
It felt a little bit rushed.

1003
01:11:05,553 --> 01:11:07,681
I know, I know. I know.

1004
01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:11,689
This is the plan: you get to the elevator.
I'm gonna distract him, okay?

1005
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:12,934
Okay.

1006
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:29,498
- Ooh! God! Damn it!
- I'm so...

1007
01:11:29,744 --> 01:11:32,964
I just spilled a hot latte all over your...
I didn't mean to do that. Oh no!

1008
01:11:33,206 --> 01:11:35,049
And you too? I'm sorry.

1009
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:36,793
- Miss! Stay right there!
- Sir.

1010
01:11:37,043 --> 01:11:39,296
- Just stay right—
- Wait, wait, wait.

1011
01:11:39,545 --> 01:11:40,546
Hey! Stop!

1012
01:11:43,007 --> 01:11:44,087
All right, on your way.

1013
01:11:44,258 --> 01:11:46,511
I'm sorry. I'm all thumbs today.

1014
01:11:51,349 --> 01:11:53,477
- Gwen Stacy.
- Oh my God.

1015
01:11:54,435 --> 01:11:55,732
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

1016
01:11:55,978 --> 01:11:57,321
No, it's okay.

1017
01:11:58,147 --> 01:12:00,491
Uh, I'm... I'm Harry.

1018
01:12:01,067 --> 01:12:02,193
Yeah.

1019
01:12:02,902 --> 01:12:06,577
I'm an old friend of Peter's.
Yeah, I know who you are. Sorry.

1020
01:12:06,823 --> 01:12:08,450
I was kind of rushing.

1021
01:12:08,699 --> 01:12:11,122
No, I'm sorry he never introduced us.

1022
01:12:11,369 --> 01:12:13,463
I thought you two had broken up.

1023
01:12:14,205 --> 01:12:15,331
Oh.

1024
01:12:16,249 --> 01:12:18,672
Yeah. Yes, we had.

1025
01:12:18,918 --> 01:12:20,465
And it's...

1026
01:12:20,711 --> 01:12:22,588
- It's complicated.
- Complicated. Yeah.

1027
01:12:22,839 --> 01:12:26,059
I mean, it's Peter. Everything's
always complicated with Peter.

1028
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:27,301
Yeah.

1029
01:12:27,844 --> 01:12:29,096
Yeah.

1030
01:12:29,804 --> 01:12:31,272
Yeah, you're right.

1031
01:12:31,848 --> 01:12:33,566
But that's why he needs you.

1032
01:12:35,268 --> 01:12:36,440
Right?

1033
01:12:38,604 --> 01:12:41,107
To help him make his choices clear.

1034
01:12:44,944 --> 01:12:45,945
Nice to meet you, Harry.

1035
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:49,199
Yeah, it's such a pleasure, Gwen.

1036
01:13:45,046 --> 01:13:48,141
You've been in a terrible accident.

1037
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:51,393
I'm Dr. Kafka.

1038
01:13:52,053 --> 01:13:53,976
I'm here to help you.

1039
01:13:54,347 --> 01:13:55,940
Course you are, doc.

1040
01:13:56,974 --> 01:14:01,070
That's why you're preparing
military-grade biostim electrodes.

1041
01:14:01,771 --> 01:14:03,648
High-intensity capacitors.

1042
01:14:04,607 --> 01:14:06,109
The kind they make at Oscorp.

1043
01:14:06,692 --> 01:14:09,286
All of this 'cause
you're trying to help me.

1044
01:14:09,528 --> 01:14:10,700
You are correct.

1045
01:14:11,072 --> 01:14:13,040
I'm here to study you.

1046
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:17,958
To understand what you are, why you are.

1047
01:14:18,204 --> 01:14:20,081
Und I will get results.

1048
01:14:25,628 --> 01:14:26,675
I always do.

1049
01:14:29,757 --> 01:14:31,475
You do realize...

1050
01:14:31,968 --> 01:14:33,891
you locked me in a prison

1051
01:14:34,428 --> 01:14:35,725
that runs...

1052
01:14:36,389 --> 01:14:37,811
on electricity?

1053
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:42,941
Mmm, I can feel it in the walls.

1054
01:14:43,229 --> 01:14:45,106
I can feel it in my veins.

1055
01:14:45,982 --> 01:14:48,656
No matter what you do doc,
you can't contain it.

1056
01:14:50,152 --> 01:14:51,244
It's a force of nature.

1057
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:53,906
Like me.

1058
01:15:01,372 --> 01:15:02,874
You wanna know how powerful I am?

1059
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:05,376
Well, so do I.

1060
01:15:05,626 --> 01:15:06,673
Ooh!

1061
01:15:10,798 --> 01:15:15,010
I'm dying to know, doc.

1062
01:15:15,845 --> 01:15:18,769
But you better make damn
sure you kill me this time.

1063
01:15:19,015 --> 01:15:20,517
Because if you don't,

1064
01:15:21,142 --> 01:15:23,190
I'm gonna kill the light.

1065
01:15:23,561 --> 01:15:27,907
<i>So everyone in this city is gonna know
how it feels to live in my world.</i>

1066
01:15:28,399 --> 01:15:30,618
<i>A world without power.</i>

1067
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:33,238
A world without mercy.

1068
01:15:33,654 --> 01:15:35,031
A world...

1069
01:15:35,281 --> 01:15:36,908
without Spider-Man.

1070
01:15:37,408 --> 01:15:41,709
And everyone will be able
to see me for who I truly am.

1071
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:44,373
And who are you?

1072
01:15:44,915 --> 01:15:46,383
Don't you know?

1073
01:15:47,043 --> 01:15:48,260
I'm Electro.

1074
01:15:53,632 --> 01:15:56,806
<i>Warning. Electrical
restraint capacity reached.</i>

1075
01:15:57,053 --> 01:15:59,806
<i>Initiate lockdown procedure immediately.</i>

1076
01:16:00,056 --> 01:16:01,683
Very impressive,

1077
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:04,314
Electro.

1078
01:16:05,061 --> 01:16:06,938
<i>Lockdown initiated.</i>

1079
01:16:19,909 --> 01:16:19,955
Aunt May?

1080
01:16:19,956 --> 01:16:21,167
Aunt May?

1081
01:16:26,624 --> 01:16:27,921
What are you doing?

1082
01:16:28,375 --> 01:16:29,797
When did you do this?

1083
01:16:39,303 --> 01:16:41,931
There's something
you're not telling me, Aunt May.

1084
01:16:42,181 --> 01:16:45,185
Every time I mention
my parents, your eyes go down.

1085
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:48,734
I know that you're not telling me something.
You lie to me. I know you love me.

1086
01:16:48,979 --> 01:16:50,822
- I don't lie.
- I know you love me, but you do.

1087
01:16:51,065 --> 01:16:52,442
Aunt May. Aunt May.

1088
01:16:53,442 --> 01:16:55,240
You have to tell me, May.

1089
01:16:56,237 --> 01:16:57,454
That's my father.

1090
01:16:57,696 --> 01:16:59,118
Yes, he was your father.

1091
01:16:59,365 --> 01:17:01,993
But that didn't seem to stop him
from leaving you...

1092
01:17:02,701 --> 01:17:03,873
here.

1093
01:17:05,538 --> 01:17:07,006
I need the truth.

1094
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:11,992
The truth is, your parents
left you here, on our doorstep.

1095
01:17:12,244 --> 01:17:13,996
And you were this
little boy whose whole world

1096
01:17:14,046 --> 01:17:16,765
was turned upside down
with no explanation.

1097
01:17:17,007 --> 01:17:21,763
We did the best we could,
your Uncle Ben and I.

1098
01:17:22,304 --> 01:17:25,604
I mean, who else was gonna care for you,
and protect you and worry about you?

1099
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:27,102
Your father?

1100
01:17:27,434 --> 01:17:28,526
No.

1101
01:17:28,769 --> 01:17:32,899
I was the one who wiped your nose,
and made you brush your teeth,

1102
01:17:33,149 --> 01:17:35,823
and do your homework,
or washed your dirty underwear. Me!

1103
01:17:36,193 --> 01:17:40,790
Your stupid, non-scientific aunt, who
doesn't know how to make ends meet,

1104
01:17:41,031 --> 01:17:42,658
who has to take nursing classes

1105
01:17:42,908 --> 01:17:45,787
with 22-year-old kids so I can
pay for you to go to college.

1106
01:17:46,036 --> 01:17:48,130
And I don't know how
to do this without Ben.

1107
01:17:48,372 --> 01:17:49,898
I don't know how and...

1108
01:17:50,291 --> 01:17:53,465
And you're dreaming about
your perfect father,

1109
01:17:53,711 --> 01:17:56,385
who was never here? No.

1110
01:17:57,548 --> 01:17:59,095
No, I won't tell you.

1111
01:17:59,383 --> 01:18:00,475
You're my boy.

1112
01:18:00,718 --> 01:18:03,062
As far as I'm concerned, you're my boy.

1113
01:18:03,304 --> 01:18:04,396
And I won't hurt you.

1114
01:18:14,023 --> 01:18:15,741
I'm your boy.

1115
01:18:16,192 --> 01:18:17,739
You're my everything.

1116
01:18:19,069 --> 01:18:22,448
You're enough.
You're more than enough.

1117
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:25,121
That's not what this is about.
Don't get that twisted.

1118
01:18:26,243 --> 01:18:28,996
- I love you so much.
- I know.

1119
01:18:33,876 --> 01:18:35,219
It's okay.

1120
01:18:36,587 --> 01:18:37,679
It's okay.

1121
01:18:40,633 --> 01:18:41,805
May,

1122
01:18:44,929 --> 01:18:47,102
I need to know.

1123
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:52,944
All right.

1124
01:18:56,565 --> 01:18:58,408
I'll tell you everything I know.

1125
01:19:01,403 --> 01:19:02,871
But it will hurt you.

1126
01:19:03,948 --> 01:19:05,074
Okay.

1127
01:19:07,785 --> 01:19:10,208
A few days after the funeral,

1128
01:19:10,454 --> 01:19:14,209
two government men
came to see us.

1129
01:19:16,293 --> 01:19:19,172
<i>They said the genetics research</i>

1130
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:22,891
<i>that your father was doing with
Norman Osborn was very valuable,</i>

1131
01:19:23,133 --> 01:19:25,761
<i>and that people
would pay a lot for it.</i>

1132
01:19:26,011 --> 01:19:28,013
<i>And that's why he ran off with it.</i>

1133
01:19:28,264 --> 01:19:29,982
<i>They said he was a traitor.</i>

1134
01:19:30,224 --> 01:19:31,976
I couldn't believe it, Peter.

1135
01:19:32,309 --> 01:19:35,153
They told us he betrayed
his best friend, all of us,

1136
01:19:35,521 --> 01:19:36,864
for the money.

1137
01:19:38,148 --> 01:19:39,240
I don't...

1138
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:44,097
Oh, I don't get it. No, I don't...
This doesn't make sense.

1139
01:19:44,321 --> 01:19:47,951
Yes, I know. I know. I didn't
believe it either. I didn't believe it.

1140
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:49,452
It doesn't make any sense.

1141
01:19:49,702 --> 01:19:50,919
Peter, I don't know.

1142
01:19:51,328 --> 01:19:54,377
For so long, I would play it over
and over and over in my head.

1143
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:56,876
What had I missed?
What had I missed?

1144
01:19:57,126 --> 01:19:59,629
He was just this
normal, unassuming guy.

1145
01:19:59,878 --> 01:20:02,973
He wore the same ratty
lab coat for 20 years.

1146
01:20:03,215 --> 01:20:05,889
He took the D train to work
at 7 every morning.

1147
01:20:06,135 --> 01:20:08,308
Came home at 6 every night.

1148
01:20:09,388 --> 01:20:10,890
I don't know.

1149
01:20:11,432 --> 01:20:14,686
Maybe everyone has
a part of themselves they hide.

1150
01:20:15,978 --> 01:20:18,231
Even from the people they love.

1151
01:20:24,528 --> 01:20:25,620
Peter.

1152
01:20:28,907 --> 01:20:30,159
Peter.

1153
01:20:34,204 --> 01:20:35,706
Mr. Osborn.

1154
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:41,886
Look up.

1155
01:20:43,088 --> 01:20:44,635
Think you're looking for me.

1156
01:20:47,384 --> 01:20:49,557
I cannot believe my eyes.

1157
01:20:51,305 --> 01:20:52,602
Spider-Man.

1158
01:20:59,897 --> 01:21:01,899
Just the man I wanted to see.

1159
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:06,036
You, um...

1160
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:08,951
talked to Peter?

1161
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:10,912
Yeah.

1162
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:20,213
I wanna help you, Mr. Osborn.
I really, really do.

1163
01:21:21,293 --> 01:21:24,923
I can't give you my blood.
Not right now.

1164
01:21:25,172 --> 01:21:26,298
Excuse me?

1165
01:21:27,257 --> 01:21:29,009
It's too dangerous.

1166
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:32,263
If our blood is incompatible, you could die.

1167
01:21:33,722 --> 01:21:35,520
I'm already dying.

1168
01:21:36,850 --> 01:21:39,273
Your blood can't make me die more.

1169
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:41,272
But it could do something worse.

1170
01:21:44,024 --> 01:21:45,196
Okay.

1171
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:48,575
All right, how much?

1172
01:21:48,821 --> 01:21:51,119
How much what?
How much do you want? Name it.

1173
01:21:51,365 --> 01:21:55,336
You want a boat? You want a plane?
You want money? How much do you want?

1174
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:58,831
- I don't want your money.
- Come on. Everybody wants my money!

1175
01:21:59,665 --> 01:22:00,666
I don't.

1176
01:22:03,210 --> 01:22:04,382
I thought you...

1177
01:22:05,212 --> 01:22:07,556
I thought you were
supposed to save people.

1178
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:12,265
I thought that's what you do,
is you save people's lives.

1179
01:22:12,511 --> 01:22:14,809
You're... You're just gonna let me die.

1180
01:22:15,055 --> 01:22:18,275
- I'm trying to protect you right now.
- No. No, you are not.

1181
01:22:18,517 --> 01:22:20,940
You're trying to protect yourself.

1182
01:22:21,478 --> 01:22:25,733
Look, we just need a bit more time

1183
01:22:25,983 --> 01:22:27,903
- to figure out something else.
- I do not have time!

1184
01:22:35,492 --> 01:22:36,584
I'm sorry.

1185
01:22:45,711 --> 01:22:48,490
You're a fraud, Spider-Man!

1186
01:23:02,986 --> 01:23:04,438
- Hey! Hi.
- Hi.

1187
01:23:04,688 --> 01:23:07,612
- Hi, I gotta talk to you for a second.
- I'm running late right now.

1188
01:23:07,858 --> 01:23:10,452
- It's just gonna take a second.
- I can't. I'm sorry, Peter.

1189
01:23:10,694 --> 01:23:13,994
Just give me one minute. I just
wanna say one thing and I'm gone.

1190
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:16,239
- Everything's a mess. Everything's insane.
- Shh. Shh.

1191
01:23:16,450 --> 01:23:18,669
My dad, my mom.
Everything I thought about them? Lies.

1192
01:23:18,911 --> 01:23:21,835
Ha! Lies. Lies, lies, lies.
Nothing makes any sense anymore.

1193
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:23,960
So here we are, I gotta figure out
what I'm gonna do with Harry.

1194
01:23:24,166 --> 01:23:25,634
Of course I wanna save him. You know?

1195
01:23:25,876 --> 01:23:27,516
I wanna save him
because he's my best pal.

1196
01:23:27,753 --> 01:23:30,597
And what if my blood works?
But what if it doesn't?

1197
01:23:30,839 --> 01:23:32,307
I don't know. I got no idea.

1198
01:23:34,218 --> 01:23:36,846
- Oh, God.
- I got nothing. I got nothing.

1199
01:23:37,095 --> 01:23:39,814
The only thing I keep
coming back to, Gwen, is...

1200
01:23:41,475 --> 01:23:42,647
Ms. Stacy?

1201
01:23:43,268 --> 01:23:44,440
Shall I take you upstairs?

1202
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:47,064
Yes. I'm so sorry.

1203
01:23:47,314 --> 01:23:51,490
I'm so sorry. I'm already late.
Can I have just one more minute?

1204
01:23:51,735 --> 01:23:53,533
- Okay.
- Thank you. I'm sorry.

1205
01:23:54,988 --> 01:23:56,956
I'm... Ahem. Okay,
I have to be...Where are we?

1206
01:23:57,199 --> 01:23:58,576
I'm at my...

1207
01:23:59,326 --> 01:24:02,000
last interview for Oxford right now.

1208
01:24:03,455 --> 01:24:05,332
- Oxford. I didn't know.
- Yeah.

1209
01:24:05,582 --> 01:24:07,801
Oh. Okay, well...

1210
01:24:08,043 --> 01:24:10,546
- I'm sorry to bother you, uh...
- What?

1211
01:24:10,796 --> 01:24:12,389
my fair lady... Madam.

1212
01:24:12,631 --> 01:24:14,383
But um... uh, who am I?

1213
01:24:14,633 --> 01:24:16,180
I mean, who am I? I'm John Hopkins.

1214
01:24:16,426 --> 01:24:18,474
- I'm one of the young professors at Harvard,
- What?

1215
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:21,690
- and I've been trying to get her to be in my...
- What?

1216
01:24:22,349 --> 01:24:24,647
Be a part of my team for a while now.

1217
01:24:24,893 --> 01:24:26,490
And she's just the best person I know

1218
01:24:26,491 --> 01:24:27,817
- and a scientific genius.
- Okay.

1219
01:24:28,063 --> 01:24:29,064
And...

1220
01:24:29,314 --> 01:24:30,736
Anyway, God save the queen.

1221
01:24:30,983 --> 01:24:32,781
- I'm sorry everything's happening...
- Peter, can you just wait for one second?

1222
01:24:33,026 --> 01:24:34,528
Peter. Peter.

1223
01:24:34,778 --> 01:24:36,371
What do you want to say to me?

1224
01:24:37,197 --> 01:24:38,665
What's the "one thing"?

1225
01:24:42,744 --> 01:24:44,587
I have to go to England, Peter.

1226
01:24:46,582 --> 01:24:47,959
It's important to me.

1227
01:24:52,337 --> 01:24:55,967
I mean, I don't know. Maybe we're
just—Maybe we're on different paths right now.

1228
01:24:56,633 --> 01:24:58,727
You know? I don't know.

1229
01:24:58,969 --> 01:25:00,312
Maybe we're just...

1230
01:25:00,846 --> 01:25:02,348
going different ways. I don't...

1231
01:25:02,598 --> 01:25:04,692
I've gotta go. I gotta go.

1232
01:25:08,103 --> 01:25:09,103
Gwen.

1233
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:13,112
Good luck.

1234
01:25:16,653 --> 01:25:18,906
Hi. Sorry.

1235
01:26:19,132 --> 01:26:22,477
<i>He took the D train
every morning at 7 to work.</i>

1236
01:26:22,969 --> 01:26:25,518
<i>Came home at 6:00 every evening.</i>

1237
01:26:33,146 --> 01:26:35,023
"Roosevelt's secret station.

1238
01:26:35,273 --> 01:26:37,651
Track 61, a secret
subterranean extension

1239
01:26:37,901 --> 01:26:40,620
of New York's D Line train
under Pershing Square

1240
01:26:40,862 --> 01:26:44,492
originally built to transport President
Franklin Roosevelt away from the public eye,

1241
01:26:44,741 --> 01:26:48,166
to keep his polio hidden
from the American people."

1242
01:26:58,338 --> 01:26:59,635
Mr. Osborn?

1243
01:27:01,466 --> 01:27:02,513
You all right?

1244
01:27:02,759 --> 01:27:05,262
Is there anything I can get you?

1245
01:27:05,512 --> 01:27:08,516
No, not unless you can
bring those spiders back to life.

1246
01:27:09,182 --> 01:27:10,229
Spiders?

1247
01:27:10,475 --> 01:27:12,443
The ones that they destroyed...

1248
01:27:13,603 --> 01:27:16,777
"to restore investor confidence."

1249
01:27:18,191 --> 01:27:19,989
Go home, Felicia.

1250
01:27:20,235 --> 01:27:21,532
Take the day off.

1251
01:27:23,822 --> 01:27:24,914
Harry.

1252
01:27:27,033 --> 01:27:30,833
I think there may be another way
to get what you're looking for.

1253
01:27:33,123 --> 01:27:37,469
I overheard Menken talking
with one of our security heads.

1254
01:27:38,545 --> 01:27:40,343
Before they destroyed the spiders,

1255
01:27:41,298 --> 01:27:42,925
they had the venom extracted.

1256
01:27:43,925 --> 01:27:46,724
Uh... what?

1257
01:27:49,014 --> 01:27:50,436
What are you saying?

1258
01:27:50,682 --> 01:27:52,525
That way, they could
comply with the lawsuits,

1259
01:27:52,768 --> 01:27:55,612
but still keep the data
in case it ever became useful.

1260
01:27:56,980 --> 01:27:57,981
Where is it?

1261
01:27:58,356 --> 01:28:00,154
It's somewhere in the building.

1262
01:28:01,651 --> 01:28:05,201
It's somewhere off-books
called "Special Projects".

1263
01:28:07,616 --> 01:28:09,038
<i>Special Projects.</i>

1264
01:28:09,316 --> 01:28:10,538
<i>Most recent entry.</i>

1265
01:28:10,952 --> 01:28:12,849
<i>One hour ago.</i>

1266
01:28:12,913 --> 01:28:15,166
"Approved by Harry Osborn."

1267
01:28:17,626 --> 01:28:20,345
<i>Accessing Ravencroft Archive.</i>

1268
01:28:25,258 --> 01:28:27,260
<i>File 713.</i>

1269
01:28:30,138 --> 01:28:31,139
What the hell?

1270
01:28:32,516 --> 01:28:34,143
<i>File 71.</i>

1271
01:28:34,392 --> 01:28:36,611
<i>Subject: Dillon, Max.</i>

1272
01:28:36,853 --> 01:28:38,355
<i>And then I'm gonna kill the light</i>

1273
01:28:38,605 --> 01:28:42,701
<i>so everyone in this city is gonna
know how it feels to live in my world.</i>

1274
01:28:42,943 --> 01:28:44,911
<i>A world without power.</i>

1275
01:28:45,153 --> 01:28:46,370
<i>A world...</i>

1276
01:28:46,613 --> 01:28:48,286
<i>without Spider-Man.</i>

1277
01:28:48,513 --> 01:28:50,086
<i>Warning.</i>

1278
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:52,202
<i>Your user access has been revoked.</i>

1279
01:28:52,619 --> 01:28:55,293
He's busy.
You can't go in there. He's busy.

1280
01:28:56,456 --> 01:28:57,548
What did you do?

1281
01:28:57,791 --> 01:29:00,214
The more relevant question is, what did you do?

1282
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:04,510
An employee is killed and in your
first action as CEO, you cover it up.

1283
01:29:04,756 --> 01:29:09,136
No, you covered it up. Then you
buried him in the bughouse using my name.

1284
01:29:09,386 --> 01:29:13,186
Ravencroft is a timeworn institution
devoted to mental improvement.

1285
01:29:13,431 --> 01:29:15,354
You are experimenting on people in there.

1286
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:17,773
Progress has its stepping stones.

1287
01:29:18,019 --> 01:29:20,818
Now, in light of your deceptive
criminal actions, you've been...

1288
01:29:21,064 --> 01:29:22,657
How do I put this gently?

1289
01:29:22,899 --> 01:29:23,900
Fired.

1290
01:29:24,359 --> 01:29:27,283
You are not going to bury me too.

1291
01:29:27,529 --> 01:29:30,203
Looks to me like you're
halfway in the ground already.

1292
01:29:30,991 --> 01:29:32,618
It's only a matter of time.

1293
01:29:33,285 --> 01:29:35,538
You're going to die a horrible death.

1294
01:29:35,871 --> 01:29:37,544
Like your father.

1295
01:29:38,206 --> 01:29:39,753
The difference is,

1296
01:29:40,208 --> 01:29:42,085
no one is gonna miss you.

1297
01:29:45,130 --> 01:29:46,131
Get him out.

1298
01:29:46,381 --> 01:29:47,382
Wait. Wait.

1299
01:29:54,723 --> 01:29:56,396
I know my way out.

1300
01:30:07,110 --> 01:30:08,657
A hundred dollars.
Can you believe that?

1301
01:30:08,904 --> 01:30:11,077
Tell you why, you should
put the lid on that but quick.

1302
01:30:11,323 --> 01:30:12,666
I tried. Good luck.

1303
01:30:12,908 --> 01:30:15,988
You should tell her to come down
here and find one of those alligators.

1304
01:32:39,929 --> 01:32:41,146
<i>Test.</i>

1305
01:32:41,765 --> 01:32:43,483
<i>My name is Richard Parker.</i>

1306
01:32:44,309 --> 01:32:45,811
<i>Whatever lies will be told about me,</i>

1307
01:32:46,061 --> 01:32:47,938
<i>I would like the world
to know the truth.</i>

1308
01:32:48,897 --> 01:32:52,151
<i>Oscorp was already a leader
in genetic research</i>

1309
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:57,247
<i>when Norman Osborn made a deal
with a foreign military organization</i>

1310
01:32:57,489 --> 01:32:59,992
<i>to continue funding my research.</i>

1311
01:33:00,241 --> 01:33:02,619
<i>And I discovered what
they were going to use it for.</i>

1312
01:33:02,952 --> 01:33:05,421
<i>Weapons.
Biological weapons, of course.</i>

1313
01:33:05,663 --> 01:33:07,006
<i>So I refused.</i>

1314
01:33:07,248 --> 01:33:10,377
<i>And now, to eliminate
me from the picture,</i>

1315
01:33:10,627 --> 01:33:14,507
<i>Norman Osborn has
falsified evidence against me</i>

1316
01:33:14,756 --> 01:33:18,260
<i>in order to take control of my work.</i>

1317
01:33:21,763 --> 01:33:23,015
Can I help you?

1318
01:33:23,389 --> 01:33:25,562
Uh yeah, you can open the gate.

1319
01:33:25,809 --> 01:33:27,106
I'm Harry Osborn.

1320
01:33:27,352 --> 01:33:31,357
Now, there's a patient in that
Isolation Wing that I need to see.

1321
01:33:31,606 --> 01:33:34,485
Joe, this is Mr. Osborn of Oscorp.

1322
01:33:34,734 --> 01:33:37,694
Sorry sir, without a yellow badge,
I can't let anyone past this point.

1323
01:33:41,032 --> 01:33:43,455
<i>But it doesn't matter because
there's something else...</i>

1324
01:33:44,494 --> 01:33:46,292
<i>that Norman doesn't know.</i>

1325
01:33:47,789 --> 01:33:52,632
<i>The human DNA that
I implanted in the spiders...</i>

1326
01:33:54,504 --> 01:33:55,630
<i>was my own.</i>

1327
01:33:58,133 --> 01:34:00,431
<i>Which means that without me,</i>

1328
01:34:00,677 --> 01:34:02,350
<i>without my bloodline,</i>

1329
01:34:03,012 --> 01:34:07,233
<i>Oscorp can never replicate
or continue my experiments.</i>

1330
01:34:07,642 --> 01:34:10,020
Keep Electro incubated

1331
01:34:10,270 --> 01:34:14,446
with 400 milligrams of sodium
thiopental und phenobarbital.

1332
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:20,275
<i>I have destroyed as much
as possible from the archives.</i>

1333
01:34:20,655 --> 01:34:22,793
<i>But I didn't have time
to kill all of the spiders.</i>

1334
01:34:22,866 --> 01:34:26,086
<i>So as a scientist,
my choice is very clear now.</i>

1335
01:34:26,327 --> 01:34:30,127
<i>I have to disappear. I have to get
as far away from here as I can.</i>

1336
01:34:30,373 --> 01:34:32,171
<i>But as a father,</i>

1337
01:34:32,542 --> 01:34:35,671
<i>it means I may not see my boy again.</i>

1338
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:40,016
<i>And nothing is as important to me</i>

1339
01:34:40,758 --> 01:34:42,760
<i>as my son, Peter.</i>

1340
01:34:43,136 --> 01:34:44,888
<i>Nothing in this world.</i>

1341
01:34:45,513 --> 01:34:47,481
<i>But I have a responsibility to</i>

1342
01:34:47,724 --> 01:34:49,772
<i>protect the world
from what I've created,</i>

1343
01:34:50,018 --> 01:34:52,988
<i>and to protect him from
what I know Osborn is capable of.</i>

1344
01:34:53,855 --> 01:34:56,233
<i>People will say I am a monster</i>

1345
01:34:57,233 --> 01:34:58,826
<i>for what I've done.</i>

1346
01:35:00,528 --> 01:35:02,030
<i>And maybe they're right.</i>

1347
01:35:04,782 --> 01:35:06,910
<i>I always thought
that I'd have more...</i>

1348
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:08,252
<i>time.</i>

1349
01:35:08,494 --> 01:35:10,371
Dad? Dad!

1350
01:35:10,622 --> 01:35:11,919
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1351
01:35:30,850 --> 01:35:32,443
<i>Sedation off.</i>

1352
01:35:33,978 --> 01:35:35,025
Psst.

1353
01:35:39,359 --> 01:35:41,361
I'm gonna get you out of here.

1354
01:35:41,778 --> 01:35:43,780
All right?
But we don't have much time.

1355
01:35:44,697 --> 01:35:45,698
Who are you?

1356
01:35:45,949 --> 01:35:49,078
I'm Harry Osborn.
I wanna make you a deal.

1357
01:35:50,870 --> 01:35:52,122
I should kill you.

1358
01:35:52,372 --> 01:35:54,090
Oh, come on.

1359
01:35:54,582 --> 01:35:56,505
Think bigger, Max.

1360
01:35:56,751 --> 01:35:58,753
I'm not the one you want.

1361
01:35:59,003 --> 01:36:00,300
You want Spider-Man.

1362
01:36:01,798 --> 01:36:03,641
And I can give him to you.

1363
01:36:03,883 --> 01:36:08,559
But I need something first.

1364
01:36:09,931 --> 01:36:12,150
I need you to get me into Oscorp.

1365
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:14,022
Get you in?

1366
01:36:14,477 --> 01:36:15,569
You own it.

1367
01:36:16,812 --> 01:36:18,190
Uh, not anymore.

1368
01:36:18,439 --> 01:36:19,691
Oscorp betrayed us both,

1369
01:36:19,941 --> 01:36:23,787
so I can't get in there without you and
you can't get out of here without me.

1370
01:36:24,737 --> 01:36:25,408
What's happening?

1371
01:36:25,655 --> 01:36:27,415
Someone pulled an
alarm in the lso Unit.

1372
01:36:27,573 --> 01:36:30,122
Get a containment team up there now.

1373
01:36:30,785 --> 01:36:32,503
You couldn't possibly know what I want.

1374
01:36:32,745 --> 01:36:34,463
You submitted the design for the grid,

1375
01:36:34,706 --> 01:36:36,583
and they stole it.
And now you want it back.

1376
01:36:36,833 --> 01:36:38,631
You just wanna take back what's yours.

1377
01:36:38,876 --> 01:36:41,595
- How?
- It is all the power in the city, Max,

1378
01:36:41,838 --> 01:36:43,761
and it's right at your fingertips.

1379
01:36:44,007 --> 01:36:45,805
And then once you
shut down the grid,

1380
01:36:46,050 --> 01:36:49,975
Spider-Man will come to you,
and I want you to make him bleed.

1381
01:36:51,931 --> 01:36:52,978
Break it! Break it!

1382
01:36:56,060 --> 01:36:57,653
Max, we don't have much time!

1383
01:36:57,895 --> 01:37:00,239
Go! Go, go! Go!

1384
01:37:00,481 --> 01:37:02,529
Give me one reason
why I should trust you.

1385
01:37:02,775 --> 01:37:03,822
Because I need you!

1386
01:37:05,737 --> 01:37:06,738
You need me?

1387
01:37:06,988 --> 01:37:09,912
Yes. I need you.

1388
01:37:10,241 --> 01:37:14,291
You are my only chance
that I have at surviving.

1389
01:37:14,537 --> 01:37:15,537
You need me?

1390
01:37:15,705 --> 01:37:17,628
Yes! I need you.

1391
01:37:18,708 --> 01:37:19,880
I need you, please! Please!

1392
01:37:21,753 --> 01:37:22,800
Please!

1393
01:37:23,129 --> 01:37:25,006
I know what it's like to be thrown away!

1394
01:37:25,256 --> 01:37:26,257
Please, Max!

1395
01:37:26,507 --> 01:37:28,430
I need you! I need you!

1396
01:38:18,851 --> 01:38:19,852
No!

1397
01:38:23,898 --> 01:38:25,525
You wanna be my friend?

1398
01:38:26,192 --> 01:38:28,365
I thought we were already friends.

1399
01:38:29,987 --> 01:38:31,409
I had a friend once.

1400
01:38:32,490 --> 01:38:34,242
It didn't work out.

1401
01:38:35,159 --> 01:38:36,456
Yeah, me too.

1402
01:38:37,954 --> 01:38:40,048
Then let's go catch a spider.

1403
01:38:43,459 --> 01:38:45,962
<i>You have one new voice message.</i>

1404
01:38:48,256 --> 01:38:50,054
<i>Hi, Peter. It's me.</i>

1405
01:38:50,967 --> 01:38:54,597
<i>Uh, I got in to Oxford.</i>

1406
01:38:54,846 --> 01:38:59,067
<i>Woo-ho! It's very exciting.</i>

1407
01:38:59,559 --> 01:39:02,904
<i>I came by your house
a little bit ago and I, um...</i>

1408
01:39:03,521 --> 01:39:04,568
<i>You weren't there,</i>

1409
01:39:04,814 --> 01:39:08,193
<i>and so I'm on my way
to the airport right now,</i>

1410
01:39:08,443 --> 01:39:11,117
<i>because there's this early
summer class that I found out about,</i>

1411
01:39:11,362 --> 01:39:14,457
<i>and I thought that
it would somehow</i>

1412
01:39:14,824 --> 01:39:18,829
<i>be easier, I guess, this way.</i>

1413
01:39:19,412 --> 01:39:22,837
<i>I think that maybe it's time</i>

1414
01:39:23,082 --> 01:39:25,255
<i>to let this go.</i>

1415
01:39:25,918 --> 01:39:28,216
<i>And that's not
because I don't love you.</i>

1416
01:39:28,463 --> 01:39:31,763
<i>It's actually because I do, so um...</i>

1417
01:39:32,383 --> 01:39:33,760
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

1418
01:39:48,274 --> 01:39:50,697
We have to move, now.
Why? What's happened?

1419
01:40:03,623 --> 01:40:05,250
Remember me?

1420
01:40:09,629 --> 01:40:10,972
Oh, my, oh, my.

1421
01:40:11,214 --> 01:40:13,182
How the tables have turned.

1422
01:40:13,758 --> 01:40:16,136
I know it's hard to admit but,

1423
01:40:16,385 --> 01:40:20,731
how spectacular a move is this?

1424
01:40:21,974 --> 01:40:24,568
- Am I right?
- Right as rain.

1425
01:40:26,187 --> 01:40:28,815
Okay, so, Fairy Godmother,

1426
01:40:29,065 --> 01:40:31,864
it is time to grant me a wish.

1427
01:40:32,109 --> 01:40:36,330
- I want in to Special—
- How dare you come back in here?

1428
01:40:37,532 --> 01:40:41,002
You recalcitrant, unworthy, defective,

1429
01:40:41,244 --> 01:40:43,212
urchin freaks.

1430
01:40:45,790 --> 01:40:50,967
Oh, God. I'm sorry. That's just not
the answer we were looking for.

1431
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:05,647
Clear.

1432
01:41:07,478 --> 01:41:10,027
Welcome back to the bonus round!

1433
01:41:11,566 --> 01:41:14,945
Hey, let's take a walk, shall we?

1434
01:41:19,282 --> 01:41:22,081
The grid is all yours.

1435
01:41:54,358 --> 01:41:56,827
The spider venom. Give it to me.

1436
01:42:02,825 --> 01:42:04,247
What is all this stuff?

1437
01:42:04,493 --> 01:42:05,995
The future.

1438
01:42:19,759 --> 01:42:20,976
Load one up.

1439
01:42:25,640 --> 01:42:26,812
It won't work.

1440
01:42:27,058 --> 01:42:30,733
We ran every diagnostic test
apart from human trials.

1441
01:42:30,878 --> 01:42:34,949
So you've actually already run human trials.
You're just too stupid to know it.

1442
01:42:38,986 --> 01:42:41,034
Do it. Now.

1443
01:43:00,675 --> 01:43:02,518
You had it all this time.

1444
01:44:32,349 --> 01:44:33,726
It's Spider-Man!

1445
01:44:39,690 --> 01:44:40,862
Stop the cab.

1446
01:44:41,108 --> 01:44:43,156
Lady, I ain't even moving.

1447
01:45:08,135 --> 01:45:09,135
Whoa!

1448
01:45:13,766 --> 01:45:15,313
- Hi.
- Hi.

1449
01:45:16,018 --> 01:45:17,978
- Did you get my message?
- What message?

1450
01:45:18,020 --> 01:45:20,694
- The message right there.
- Oh, that. That was you?

1451
01:45:20,940 --> 01:45:22,738
- Don't do that.
- I couldn't make it out.

1452
01:45:22,983 --> 01:45:25,111
I'll tell you what it says.
It says, "I love you."

1453
01:45:26,779 --> 01:45:28,497
'Cause I love you.

1454
01:45:29,532 --> 01:45:31,955
- And no offense, but you're wrong.
- I'm wrong about what?

1455
01:45:32,201 --> 01:45:34,044
You're wrong about us
being on different paths.

1456
01:45:34,286 --> 01:45:36,630
We're not on different paths.
You're my path.

1457
01:45:37,706 --> 01:45:39,879
And you're always gonna be my path.

1458
01:45:40,835 --> 01:45:44,385
And I know there's a million reasons why
we shouldn't be together. I know that.

1459
01:45:44,713 --> 01:45:46,386
But I'm tired of them.

1460
01:45:49,009 --> 01:45:51,307
I'm tired of every single one of them.

1461
01:45:51,804 --> 01:45:53,727
We all gotta make a choice.

1462
01:45:55,641 --> 01:45:57,109
Right? Well, I choose you.

1463
01:45:59,728 --> 01:46:00,980
So,

1464
01:46:01,230 --> 01:46:02,777
here's my thought.

1465
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:05,743
England.

1466
01:46:07,069 --> 01:46:08,412
Both of us.

1467
01:46:10,281 --> 01:46:11,874
I'm following you now.

1468
01:46:12,408 --> 01:46:14,251
I'm just gonna follow you everywhere.

1469
01:46:14,827 --> 01:46:16,795
I'm just gonna follow you
the rest of my life.

1470
01:46:17,955 --> 01:46:21,175
I mean, they got crime there in England.

1471
01:46:21,417 --> 01:46:23,090
- Yeah.
- They got tons of crime, it seems.

1472
01:46:23,335 --> 01:46:25,258
- Tons.
- They got uh,

1473
01:46:25,921 --> 01:46:27,415
Jack the Ripper.

1474
01:46:28,299 --> 01:46:29,300
What?

1475
01:46:29,550 --> 01:46:32,053
They haven't caught Jack the Ripper yet.
You didn't know that?

1476
01:46:52,156 --> 01:46:53,328
What the hell is that?

1477
01:47:03,959 --> 01:47:05,506
Is that Max?

1478
01:47:06,086 --> 01:47:08,339
He must have cut
the power to the whole city.

1479
01:47:16,931 --> 01:47:18,649
PNA 322, you are...

1480
01:47:19,016 --> 01:47:21,064
- I'm black.
- I have nothing.

1481
01:47:21,310 --> 01:47:23,654
Hey, I need Tech Ops up here right now.

1482
01:47:23,896 --> 01:47:26,399
The phones are down. Somebody
go down and grab Tech Ops.

1483
01:47:26,774 --> 01:47:28,572
Hey, write down
what you remember, people.

1484
01:47:28,817 --> 01:47:32,572
There's gotta be some kind of blackout
plan, right? Some kind of backup?

1485
01:47:32,821 --> 01:47:35,665
There's an emergency reset
at the power plant.

1486
01:47:35,908 --> 01:47:38,752
If he cuts the transmission lines,
they're never gonna get this back up.

1487
01:47:38,994 --> 01:47:41,755
How will I stop him? Every time I get
close, he fries my web shooters.

1488
01:47:41,914 --> 01:47:43,882
- Have you tried grounding them?
- Tried everything.

1489
01:47:44,124 --> 01:47:46,172
- Rubber, plastic...
- Did you try magnetizing them?

1490
01:47:46,418 --> 01:47:48,887
I didn't try magnetizing them.

1491
01:47:49,129 --> 01:47:51,302
Okay well, remember
8th grade science class?

1492
01:47:51,966 --> 01:47:54,594
If you magnetize a nail with a battery...

1493
01:47:55,010 --> 01:47:56,887
- It holds an electric charge.
- Yes.

1494
01:47:59,264 --> 01:48:02,484
New York Approach. This is
Pan National 273 on approach.

1495
01:48:02,726 --> 01:48:04,023
How do you hear?

1496
01:48:05,020 --> 01:48:06,363
Approach, do you copy?

1497
01:48:06,605 --> 01:48:08,573
Radio's working. It's not us.

1498
01:48:15,489 --> 01:48:20,165
Do not panic!
Everyone, please return to your vehicles.

1499
01:48:20,411 --> 01:48:22,288
Go back to your cars.

1500
01:48:22,746 --> 01:48:23,963
Remain calm.

1501
01:48:25,416 --> 01:48:28,010
Do not panic.
Everyone return to your vehicles.

1502
01:48:28,252 --> 01:48:29,720
- Go into your homes.
- Officer!

1503
01:48:30,129 --> 01:48:31,255
- Spider-Man!
- Oh!

1504
01:48:31,505 --> 01:48:33,758
My father was Captain George
Stacy of the 19th Precinct.

1505
01:48:34,008 --> 01:48:36,761
- Yeah, I knew who he was. What can we do for you?
- Jumper cables.

1506
01:48:37,011 --> 01:48:39,139
- Jumper cables?
- Yes. And copper wire.

1507
01:48:39,388 --> 01:48:41,811
Am I talking louder
than I usually talk right now?

1508
01:48:42,558 --> 01:48:44,060
- Yes.
- Whoo!

1509
01:48:44,393 --> 01:48:46,753
- Your suit will ground you.
- All right, do it.

1510
01:48:49,815 --> 01:48:52,694
Okay, good. Try, try, try.
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

1511
01:48:52,943 --> 01:48:53,944
Okay it works, good.

1512
01:48:54,194 --> 01:48:55,874
And that is why you were
number two at Midtown.

1513
01:48:56,113 --> 01:48:57,113
Rub it in. Okay.

1514
01:48:59,366 --> 01:49:00,959
- I gotta go.
- I'm coming with you.

1515
01:49:01,201 --> 01:49:03,044
- No, you're not coming with me.
- Yes, I am.

1516
01:49:03,287 --> 01:49:04,539
- Why? It's too dangerous.
- I'm coming with you.

1517
01:49:04,788 --> 01:49:07,211
I've seen the grid specs and
I know how to reset the entire system.

1518
01:49:07,458 --> 01:49:11,429
- I'm coming with you! You know that you need me!
- Okay, okay. Uh... You're coming with me!

1519
01:49:11,670 --> 01:49:12,922
Shut the thing.

1520
01:49:13,297 --> 01:49:15,049
Sorry, I love you. Don't hate me.

1521
01:49:16,842 --> 01:49:18,185
Peter!

1522
01:49:18,427 --> 01:49:20,270
We still don't have
backup generators.

1523
01:49:20,512 --> 01:49:21,889
Get me Engineering!

1524
01:49:22,264 --> 01:49:23,464
I need a respirator right now.

1525
01:49:23,682 --> 01:49:25,525
They're battery-operated. I'll get it.

1526
01:49:25,768 --> 01:49:26,940
Hang on.

1527
01:49:27,686 --> 01:49:28,733
Okay.

1528
01:49:51,543 --> 01:49:53,796
<i>Do you see me now, Spider-Man?</i>

1529
01:49:54,088 --> 01:49:57,342
<i>It's time to meet our destiny.</i>

1530
01:50:12,481 --> 01:50:14,921
Tower, we're experiencing
some kind of electrical disturbance.

1531
01:50:15,150 --> 01:50:17,653
Instruments are going haywire.
Radar is down.

1532
01:50:18,112 --> 01:50:20,331
We're flying blind out here.
Do you copy?

1533
01:50:24,952 --> 01:50:27,375
I repeat, we are standby only.
What is happening?

1534
01:50:27,621 --> 01:50:30,875
Sir? There are two inbound
flights on intersecting paths.

1535
01:50:31,125 --> 01:50:32,843
Time to impact?
Four and a half minutes.

1536
01:50:33,085 --> 01:50:34,411
Clock it. Clock it right now.

1537
01:50:48,183 --> 01:50:50,356
You're too late, Spider-Man.

1538
01:50:50,686 --> 01:50:52,359
I designed this power grid.

1539
01:50:52,604 --> 01:50:56,157
Now I'm gonna take back
what is rightfully mine.

1540
01:50:56,525 --> 01:50:58,698
I will control everything.

1541
01:50:58,944 --> 01:51:02,574
And I will be like a god to them.

1542
01:51:02,823 --> 01:51:04,120
A god named Sparkles?

1543
01:51:14,459 --> 01:51:15,756
Not this time.

1544
01:51:16,128 --> 01:51:17,846
Is that all you got? Come on!

1545
01:51:37,691 --> 01:51:38,863
Come on!

1546
01:51:43,113 --> 01:51:44,285
You ready to give up?

1547
01:51:54,958 --> 01:51:57,461
Oh, thank you, Gwen Stacy.

1548
01:52:08,180 --> 01:52:09,807
Just shake it off.
It's just your bones,

1549
01:52:10,057 --> 01:52:12,536
and your muscles and your organs.

1550
01:52:15,854 --> 01:52:17,322
Oh, boy.

1551
01:52:24,696 --> 01:52:25,697
I hate this song!

1552
01:52:46,677 --> 01:52:47,678
Spider-Man,

1553
01:52:48,095 --> 01:52:49,438
bet you never saw this coming.

1554
01:52:57,104 --> 01:52:58,902
Really? You web me to a car?

1555
01:52:59,231 --> 01:53:00,528
What are you, a caveman?

1556
01:53:00,774 --> 01:53:01,991
You shouldn't be here.

1557
01:53:02,234 --> 01:53:04,828
You tie me up to go off to war!
I know how to help you!

1558
01:53:05,070 --> 01:53:07,198
- What are you doing here?!
- I know the grid specs!

1559
01:53:07,447 --> 01:53:08,744
I can reset the system!

1560
01:53:08,991 --> 01:53:11,210
You can't be here right now.
I'm not messing around.

1561
01:53:11,451 --> 01:53:13,171
You can't be here right now.
This is insane!

1562
01:53:13,412 --> 01:53:16,382
Nobody makes my decisions
for me. All right? Nobody.

1563
01:53:16,623 --> 01:53:18,671
This is my choice, okay?

1564
01:53:19,376 --> 01:53:21,799
- My choice. This is mine.
- Oh!

1565
01:53:22,087 --> 01:53:24,260
- Now, how do we stop him?
- Okay. So he's electric,

1566
01:53:24,506 --> 01:53:25,974
he's like a battery.

1567
01:53:26,216 --> 01:53:27,889
So what happens if
you overcharge a battery?

1568
01:53:28,135 --> 01:53:29,136
- It explodes.
- Right.

1569
01:53:29,386 --> 01:53:30,986
So we use his power against him. Perfect.

1570
01:53:31,221 --> 01:53:33,064
- Okay.
- I think I can reconnect the power lines.

1571
01:53:33,307 --> 01:53:34,775
But what I need you to do?
I need you to reset the system.

1572
01:53:35,058 --> 01:53:37,902
Okay. When I say you turn
that power on, you turn it on.

1573
01:53:38,145 --> 01:53:40,443
- No matter what. No matter what.
- Peter.

1574
01:53:45,485 --> 01:53:46,828
Go, go!

1575
01:54:38,872 --> 01:54:40,920
Sixty seconds to impact.

1576
01:55:15,534 --> 01:55:16,535
Now, Gwen. Now!

1577
01:55:16,785 --> 01:55:17,911
Do it now!

1578
01:55:43,520 --> 01:55:44,692
Uni 687...

1579
01:55:55,824 --> 01:55:58,623
This is LaGuardia Tower.
Turn immediately to heading 280.

1580
01:55:59,327 --> 01:56:02,331
You have incoming traffic. I repeat, 280.

1581
01:56:02,581 --> 01:56:03,878
<i>Defend immediately.</i>

1582
01:56:14,593 --> 01:56:15,936
Whoo!

1583
01:56:19,389 --> 01:56:20,390
Yes!

1584
01:56:21,016 --> 01:56:23,256
All right, people, back to work.
Let's land these planes.

1585
01:56:23,477 --> 01:56:24,854
I'll be back in a minute.

1586
01:56:25,395 --> 01:56:27,648
Oh, thank God. All right!

1587
01:56:27,898 --> 01:56:29,900
All right, we're back.
Everyone, let's go.

1588
01:57:05,936 --> 01:57:07,734
I think we can still make your flight.

1589
01:57:16,571 --> 01:57:17,697
Gwen, stay there.

1590
01:57:43,765 --> 01:57:45,187
Peter.

1591
01:57:46,101 --> 01:57:49,275
When you said Spider-Man said no,

1592
01:57:49,771 --> 01:57:53,821
you meant you said no.

1593
01:57:54,067 --> 01:57:56,490
Harry, what did you do?

1594
01:57:56,736 --> 01:57:58,738
What you made me do.

1595
01:57:59,281 --> 01:58:03,581
You were my friend and you betrayed me!

1596
01:58:03,868 --> 01:58:04,994
No.

1597
01:58:05,453 --> 01:58:07,376
- I was trying to protect you.
- Oh.

1598
01:58:08,123 --> 01:58:09,375
Look at me!

1599
01:58:09,624 --> 01:58:11,718
Hey, it's gonna be okay.
This is gonna be all right.

1600
01:58:12,127 --> 01:58:13,727
You don't give people hope.

1601
01:58:14,087 --> 01:58:15,634
You take it away.

1602
01:58:15,880 --> 01:58:16,927
No, Harry.

1603
01:58:17,507 --> 01:58:19,475
I'm gonna take away yours.

1604
01:58:19,718 --> 01:58:21,215
No! Gwen, run!

1605
01:58:21,511 --> 01:58:22,683
Harry!

1606
01:58:23,305 --> 01:58:24,602
Harry, put her down!

1607
01:58:41,531 --> 01:58:43,374
Harry, stop this right now!

1608
01:58:43,407 --> 01:58:46,336
This isn't you, Harry. This is not you!
Harry, put her down!

1609
01:58:46,911 --> 01:58:48,834
- Harry.
- Harry is dead!

1610
01:58:49,080 --> 01:58:52,050
Harry, this is between you and me.
You wanna fight?

1611
01:58:52,292 --> 01:58:54,340
Fight me! Let her go!

1612
01:58:54,878 --> 01:58:56,004
Okay.

1613
01:58:57,213 --> 01:58:58,213
No!

1614
01:59:06,139 --> 01:59:07,892
You okay?

1615
01:59:12,854 --> 01:59:14,982
I got you, Gwen. I'm gonna
put you down right here.

1616
02:00:35,228 --> 02:00:36,228
Peter?

1617
02:01:39,876 --> 02:01:42,095
Hey. Hey-

1618
02:01:45,340 --> 02:01:46,387
Gwen?

1619
02:01:49,052 --> 02:01:50,053
Hey.

1620
02:01:50,428 --> 02:01:51,554
Hey!

1621
02:01:56,392 --> 02:01:57,484
Gwen?

1622
02:01:59,521 --> 02:02:00,522
Hey.

1623
02:02:04,067 --> 02:02:05,114
Breathe.

1624
02:02:06,653 --> 02:02:08,576
Hey, Gwen.

1625
02:02:09,572 --> 02:02:10,573
Hey.

1626
02:02:14,327 --> 02:02:15,374
Hey.

1627
02:02:17,789 --> 02:02:19,086
You're okay.

1628
02:02:22,836 --> 02:02:23,928
Gwen?

1629
02:02:29,843 --> 02:02:31,345
Stay with me, stay with me.

1630
02:02:31,594 --> 02:02:33,972
Stay with me, stay with me.
You stay with me.

1631
02:02:39,727 --> 02:02:40,819
Gwen.

1632
02:02:43,523 --> 02:02:44,570
Gwen!

1633
02:02:47,569 --> 02:02:50,118
No, please. Please.

1634
02:02:52,657 --> 02:02:54,034
Please.

1635
02:03:00,915 --> 02:03:03,168
I can't do this without you.

1636
02:05:05,832 --> 02:05:07,254
Leave us.

1637
02:05:11,546 --> 02:05:13,139
You've made progress.

1638
02:05:13,381 --> 02:05:16,601
I've identified several
worthy candidates.

1639
02:05:16,843 --> 02:05:18,937
Now that Spider-Man's gone,

1640
02:05:19,178 --> 02:05:22,227
this city will never be the same.

1641
02:05:22,473 --> 02:05:25,022
Oh, I'm counting on that.

1642
02:05:25,268 --> 02:05:26,861
Speaking of progress,

1643
02:05:27,303 --> 02:05:28,650
you're looking better.

1644
02:05:29,105 --> 02:05:30,948
It comes and goes.

1645
02:05:32,650 --> 02:05:34,118
Tell me more.

1646
02:05:34,694 --> 02:05:36,241
How many men did you have in mind?

1647
02:05:36,487 --> 02:05:38,489
I wanna keep it small.

1648
02:05:38,740 --> 02:05:42,119
Everything you need
is already at Oscorp.

1649
02:05:44,078 --> 02:05:45,580
<i>Access granted.</i>

1650
02:05:45,830 --> 02:05:47,753
<i>Welcome, Mr. Fiers.</i>

1651
02:05:48,041 --> 02:05:49,759
<i>Who's our first volunteer?</i>

1652
02:05:50,001 --> 02:05:51,799
<i>Aleksei Sytsevich.</i>

1653
02:05:52,045 --> 02:05:54,218
<i>Currently serving a life sentence.</i>

1654
02:05:54,464 --> 02:05:58,176
<i>He is most eager to join us.</i>

1655
02:05:59,010 --> 02:06:00,307
<i>Good.</i>

1656
02:06:00,970 --> 02:06:02,972
<i>Start with him.</i>

1657
02:06:03,473 --> 02:06:05,020
<i>Russian gangster Aleksei Sytsevich</i>

1658
02:06:05,266 --> 02:06:07,189
<i>was broken out of
a classified penitentiary</i>

1659
02:06:07,435 --> 02:06:10,609
<i>known simply as the Vault
by an unknown team of men.</i>

1660
02:06:10,855 --> 02:06:13,278
<i>It's yet another example
of increased criminal activity</i>

1661
02:06:13,524 --> 02:06:16,698
<i>since the disappearance
of Spider-Man five months ago.</i>

1662
02:06:16,944 --> 02:06:20,198
<i>The web-slinger's absence has left
a hole in the heart of the city.</i>

1663
02:06:20,448 --> 02:06:23,042
<i>Believe it or not, even the New
York City Police Department</i>

1664
02:06:23,284 --> 02:06:25,286
<i>has joined the chorus
of New Yorkers in hoping</i>

1665
02:06:25,536 --> 02:06:27,630
<i>for the return of the web-slinger.</i>

1666
02:06:27,872 --> 02:06:30,045
<i>The entire world seems to be
asking the same question:</i>

1667
02:06:30,708 --> 02:06:32,085
<i>Where is Spider-Man?</i>

1668
02:06:33,337 --> 02:06:36,510
Oh. Too bad about that spider guy.

1669
02:06:38,049 --> 02:06:40,928
Too bad he's disappeared. Seems
like everybody really needs him.

1670
02:06:42,929 --> 02:06:44,226
Where you going?

1671
02:06:45,431 --> 02:06:48,105
- Eat my cereal.
- Peter.

1672
02:06:48,518 --> 02:06:50,191
Where you going?

1673
02:07:00,154 --> 02:07:01,201
I don't know.

1674
02:07:03,491 --> 02:07:05,164
You know, it's so funny. I've been...

1675
02:07:05,910 --> 02:07:08,754
I've been trying to clean up
around here, get organized,

1676
02:07:09,163 --> 02:07:13,384
and been putting
some of Ben's stuff in boxes.

1677
02:07:14,168 --> 02:07:17,889
And it's so funny, the heavier
the box gets, the lighter I feel.

1678
02:07:18,631 --> 02:07:20,679
- You're throwing his stuff away?
- No.

1679
02:07:20,925 --> 02:07:22,142
No. God, no.

1680
02:07:22,510 --> 02:07:25,639
I couldn't do that. It's part of me.

1681
02:07:26,514 --> 02:07:31,902
I'm just findinga better place for it.

1682
02:07:35,648 --> 02:07:37,571
I'm gonna take one last look,

1683
02:07:39,026 --> 02:07:40,653
and I'm gonna put it
where it belongs.

1684
02:08:05,928 --> 02:08:10,149
<i>It's easy to feel hopeful
on a  beautiful day like today.</i>

1685
02:08:11,350 --> 02:08:14,229
<i>But there will be
dark days ahead of us too.</i>

1686
02:08:15,062 --> 02:08:17,611
<i>There will be days
where you feel all alone.</i>

1687
02:08:20,151 --> 02:08:22,574
<i>And that's when hope
is needed most.</i>

1688
02:08:24,030 --> 02:08:26,078
<i>No matter how buried it gets,</i>

1689
02:08:26,908 --> 02:08:29,002
<i>or how lost you feel,</i>

1690
02:08:29,243 --> 02:08:30,961
<i>you must promise me</i>

1691
02:08:31,204 --> 02:08:34,549
<i>that you will hold onto hope.</i>

1692
02:08:36,250 --> 02:08:37,502
<i>Keep it alive.</i>

1693
02:08:38,419 --> 02:08:41,047
<i>We have to be greater
than what we suffer.</i>

1694
02:08:41,297 --> 02:08:45,135
<i>My wish for you is to become hope.</i>

1695
02:08:45,593 --> 02:08:47,061
<i>People need that.</i>

1696
02:08:48,387 --> 02:08:50,355
<i>And even if we fail,</i>

1697
02:08:50,723 --> 02:08:52,771
<i>what better way is there to live'?</i>

1698
02:08:54,352 --> 02:08:56,104
<i>As we look around here today</i>

1699
02:08:56,479 --> 02:08:59,699
<i>at all of the people
who helped make us who we are,</i>

1700
02:09:00,399 --> 02:09:02,822
<i>I know it feels like
we're saying goodbye.</i>

1701
02:09:03,361 --> 02:09:06,035
<i>But we will carry
a piece of each other</i>

1702
02:09:06,280 --> 02:09:09,033
<i>into everything that we do next,</i>

1703
02:09:10,701 --> 02:09:13,705
<i>to remind us of who we are,</i>

1704
02:09:15,581 --> 02:09:17,208
<i>and of who we're meant to be.</i>

1705
02:09:19,669 --> 02:09:21,842
<i>I've had a great four years with you.</i>

1706
02:09:22,088 --> 02:09:24,090
<i>I'll miss you all very much.</i>

1707
02:09:39,397 --> 02:09:40,398
Whoa!

1708
02:09:46,487 --> 02:09:47,579
Let's go! Move it.

1709
02:09:55,955 --> 02:09:57,423
Get down! Take cover!

1710
02:10:01,252 --> 02:10:05,553
<i>I'm here live on Park Avenue and
56th Street where it is complete chaos.</i>

1711
02:10:05,798 --> 02:10:08,017
<i>A man in some son of
weaponized armored suit</i>

1712

<i>is wreaking havoc on Midtown.</i>

1713
02:10:13,723 --> 02:10:16,351
I am the Rhino!

1714
02:10:16,600 --> 02:10:19,023
I told you I would be back!

1715
02:10:30,281 --> 02:10:32,409
- No! No!
- A kid!

1716
02:10:37,621 --> 02:10:38,621
Hold your fire!

1717
02:10:38,998 --> 02:10:40,625
Everybody, hold your fire.

1718
02:10:41,459 --> 02:10:44,554
<i>Unit 2, stand down. Stand down.
Civilian in our line of sight.</i>

1719
02:10:48,507 --> 02:10:49,554
Kid! You gotta get...

1720
02:10:51,719 --> 02:10:53,517
Look, New York!

1721
02:10:53,763 --> 02:10:55,606
Spider-Man is back.

1722
02:10:56,182 --> 02:10:57,183
Leave the kid alone!

1723
02:10:57,433 --> 02:10:59,356
That's my baby, please.

1724
02:11:02,438 --> 02:11:04,532
Brave boy, huh?

1725
02:11:04,815 --> 02:11:07,159
Does Aleksei scare you, little boy?

1726
02:11:24,460 --> 02:11:25,962
Hey, Spider-Man.

1727
02:11:36,389 --> 02:11:37,686
I knew you'd come back.

1728
02:11:38,182 --> 02:11:40,526
Yeah. Thanks for stepping up for me.

1729
02:11:40,768 --> 02:11:42,862
You're the bravest kid I've ever seen.

1730
