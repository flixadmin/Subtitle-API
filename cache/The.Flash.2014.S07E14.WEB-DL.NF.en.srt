You grew up in some mansion

She's more than just my cousin.

even if they're your family.
- How can you say that?

366
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:37,713
You fought Black Hole
to save your parents.

- That is not the same thing.
- Why not?

Why is your family good enough
to save, but mine isn't?

369

- Because I didn't save them.

370
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:50,226
By the time I got my parents
out of Black Hole,

it was way too late.

The people that raised me
were gone.

373
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:06,284
Carver put my parents in charge
of all international accounts.

374
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,161
He gave them 10%,

375
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:11,413

Black Hole's overseas assets

hidden from
the U.S. government.

377
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:20,047
Carver bought my parents'
loyalty for billions.

378
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:25,636
And once they got a taste,
they needed more.

- And what happened,
once Carver was gone?

380
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:33,644
- My parents were in too deep.

381
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:38,107
And worse, they got used
to this lifestyle.

382
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:42,862
And no matter how hard I tried,
I could not pull them out.

383
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:48,408
- Because they didn't want out.

384
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:54,748
Which is why you have to pull
with everything you have.

385
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,378
When I first met Team Flash,
it was in handcuffs.

386

When they first met you,
you were robbing a bank.

Okay. Sorry. Look, I know

We couldn't track Ultraviolet's

399
00:23:52,265 --> 00:23:54,892
But you and Ultraviolet
have the same powers,

400
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:57,019
so if we use you
as an input signal,
