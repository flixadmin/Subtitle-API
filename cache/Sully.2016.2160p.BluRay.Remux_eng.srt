1
00:00:05,423 --> 00:00:06,716
Cactus 1549.

2
00:00:06,883 --> 00:00:08,593
Runway four. Cleared for takeoff.

3
00:00:09,093 --> 00:00:11,513
Cactus 1549. Cleared for takeoff.

4
00:00:28,029 --> 00:00:30,281
Mayday, mayday. Cactus 1549.

5
00:00:30,448 --> 00:00:32,951
We've lost both engines. Both engines.

6
00:00:37,622 --> 00:00:38,957
No relight on one or two.

7
00:00:39,123 --> 00:00:40,333
Cactus 1549,
if we can get it for you,

8
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,126
do you wanna try to land runway 1-3?

9
00:00:42,293 --> 00:00:43,336
Departure control, we can make it.

10
00:00:43,503 --> 00:00:45,755
We're turning back towards LaGuardia.

11
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:04,983
LaGuardia Tower, Cactus 1549,
trying to make 1-3.

12
00:01:05,149 --> 00:01:06,693
Sully, we're too low.

13
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:08,361
Sully, we're too low!

14
00:01:08,528 --> 00:01:09,737
Come on.

15
00:01:20,415 --> 00:01:21,541
Just a little farther.

16
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:24,586
Come on.

17
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:31,926
Sully!

18
00:01:32,176 --> 00:01:33,344
Lorrie, I love you.

19
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,403
What the hell's the matter with you?

20
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:19,992
The onboard count, 150 passengers,

21
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,370
three flight attendants
and two pilots, one of whom,

22
00:03:22,537 --> 00:03:25,415
the senior pilot, drew on
all of his experience and skill,

23
00:03:25,581 --> 00:03:27,959
which combined with
near-miraculous good luck

24
00:03:28,126 --> 00:03:29,877
and a result that was,
frankly, astounding.

25
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:31,838
There were some non-critical injuries,

26
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:34,090
but everyone, everyone, survived.

27
00:03:34,257 --> 00:03:37,343
The first pictures
of US Airways Flight 1549 reveal...

28
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:40,847
You think that you're gonna die.
That's what you think.

29
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:43,558
And then, miraculously, you don't.

30
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,601
Thank you, Captain.

31
00:03:45,977 --> 00:03:48,354
Thank you, thank you.

32
00:03:59,741 --> 00:04:01,659
Okay, thank you,
everybody, thank you.

33
00:04:01,826 --> 00:04:03,870
Thank you, Captain Sullenberger,
for being here today.

34
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:06,164
We also wanna welcome
First Officer Skiles.

35
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,665
I'm glad you could make it in
this morning.

36
00:04:07,874 --> 00:04:09,792
Not as glad as we are.

37
00:04:11,586 --> 00:04:12,879
For the record,
we had an Aircraft Systems Team

38
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:14,046
on this investigation.

39
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:15,882
Also Aircraft Structures, MRT,

40
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:17,925
Aircraft Performance, ATC,

41
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:21,053
Wildlife Factors, Survival Factors
and Emergency Response.

42
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,849
Today, we begin with our operation
and human performance investigation

43
00:04:25,016 --> 00:04:27,268
on the crash of US Airways Flight 1549.

44
00:04:27,435 --> 00:04:29,687
- Water landing.
- Captain?

45
00:04:29,854 --> 00:04:31,689
This was not a crash
and it wasn't a ditching.

46
00:04:32,565 --> 00:04:34,942
We knew what we were
trying to execute here.

47
00:04:35,109 --> 00:04:36,152
It was not a...

48
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:38,446
It was not a crash.
It was a forced water landing.

49
00:04:38,863 --> 00:04:41,449
Why didn't you attempt
to return to LaGuardia?

50
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:45,411
There simply was not enough altitude.

51
00:04:45,578 --> 00:04:48,206
The Hudson was the only place
that was long enough and smooth enough

52
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:50,708
and wide enough to even attempt
to land the airplane safely.

53
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:51,876
Air Traffic testified

54
00:04:52,043 --> 00:04:53,795
that you stated
you were returning to LaGuardia,

55
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:55,546
but you did not.

56
00:04:56,464 --> 00:04:59,383
As I began the left turn,

57
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,053
I realized I couldn't make it back

58
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,013
and it would have eliminated
all the other options.

59
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,057
Returning to LaGuardia
would have been a mistake.

60
00:05:06,224 --> 00:05:08,601
Okay, well, let's get into how you
calculated all those parameters.

61
00:05:08,768 --> 00:05:09,936
There was no time for calculating.

62
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:13,648
I had to rely on my experience
of managing the altitude and speed

63
00:05:13,815 --> 00:05:15,900
of thousands of flights over four decades.

64
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:17,485
You're saying you didn't do any...

65
00:05:17,652 --> 00:05:19,111
I eyeballed it.

66
00:05:19,612 --> 00:05:21,447
You eyeballed it?

67
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:23,491
Yes.

68
00:05:23,658 --> 00:05:26,619
The best chance those passengers had
was on that river.

69
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:28,621
And I'd bet my life on it.

70
00:05:28,788 --> 00:05:30,081
In fact, I did.

71
00:05:30,623 --> 00:05:31,999
And I would do it again.

72
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:33,960
Aviation engineers are theorizing

73
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:36,170
you had enough energy
to make it back to a runway.

74
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:39,799
Well, engineers are not pilots.

75
00:05:39,966 --> 00:05:41,592
They're wrong.

76
00:05:42,051 --> 00:05:43,511
And they weren't there.

77
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,013
Regardless, we have to follow up
on all implications

78
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,765
as part of our investigation.

79
00:05:47,932 --> 00:05:50,434
Our computers will run
return scenario algorithms.

80
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:53,145
It'll generate simulations
with your exact parameters.

81
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:55,189
The dual engine loss, the altitude.

82
00:05:55,356 --> 00:05:57,608
Everything you faced
when you made your decision.

83
00:05:57,775 --> 00:06:00,069
I would like to oversee
those computer simulations.

84
00:06:00,236 --> 00:06:01,696
Not possible during an investigation.

85
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:04,574
You stated that it was
a dual engine failure

86
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,034
due to multiple bird strikes?

87
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:09,036
That would be unprecedented.

88
00:06:09,579 --> 00:06:13,499
Well, everything is unprecedented
until it happens for the first time.

89
00:06:16,794 --> 00:06:18,462
How much sleep did you get
the night before?

90
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:20,047
Eight hours. Enough.

91
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:21,924
Is it possible your blood sugar was low?

92
00:06:22,091 --> 00:06:24,969
I was rested, alert
and completely aware of my surroundings.

93
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:27,138
When was your last drink,
Captain Sullenberger?

94
00:06:27,305 --> 00:06:28,306
Nine days ago.

95
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:29,473
Drugs?

96
00:06:29,682 --> 00:06:30,683
No. Never.

97
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:32,143
First Officer Skiles?

98
00:06:33,394 --> 00:06:35,313
Don't drink. Never have.

99
00:06:37,857 --> 00:06:41,611
Captain, have you had
any troubles at home lately?

100
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:44,780
No more than anyone else.

101
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:46,991
And nothing that affected my work.

102
00:06:51,871 --> 00:06:53,748
It's bullshit.

103
00:06:53,915 --> 00:06:57,418
Why are they looking for something
we did wrong when it all turned out right?

104
00:06:57,585 --> 00:06:58,669
It didn't turn out all right
for the airline

105
00:06:58,836 --> 00:07:00,129
and their insurance company.

106
00:07:00,296 --> 00:07:02,006
We should expect some blowback.

107
00:07:02,173 --> 00:07:05,051
Come on, Mike. What are they gonna say?
That he shouldn't have saved everybody?

108
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:07,845
It's not personal.
NTSB's just doing its job.

109
00:07:08,012 --> 00:07:10,890
Once they have all the facts,
it'll calm down.

110
00:07:11,057 --> 00:07:12,183
Sully,

111
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:15,478
they should pin on the medal
and send you back to work.

112
00:07:15,645 --> 00:07:17,021
Sorry. This mailbox is full.

113
00:07:17,188 --> 00:07:20,358
I didn't call Lorrie since this morning.
Apparently everyone else did.

114
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:23,903
Not meaning to bother, but I have to say,

115
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,030
it is an honor driving you today.

116
00:07:26,364 --> 00:07:27,782
Thank you.

117
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:29,700
What has it been this year so far?

118
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:33,496
Bernie Madoff, two wars without end.
Many million new people with no work.

119
00:07:33,663 --> 00:07:35,873
And that's just the first
two weeks of January.

120
00:07:36,332 --> 00:07:39,877
Friday's headline? This is beautiful.

121
00:07:42,505 --> 00:07:45,383
Hey, Mike. How about we add
the driver as a character witness?

122
00:07:57,436 --> 00:07:58,479
Finally!

123
00:07:58,646 --> 00:08:00,231
Yeah, finally.

124
00:08:00,398 --> 00:08:02,692
The NTSB had us tied up all day.

125
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:04,443
I know.

126
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:06,612
I just needed to hear your voice.

127
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:08,447
I've been hearing everybody else's.

128
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:10,866
You'd be amazed how many cousins you have.

129
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:14,286
It doesn't feel much like family here.

130
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:20,543
Pretty quiet here, too.

131
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:25,756
The reporters want me to give an update
inside the mind of Sully.

132
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:27,299
What should I tell them?

133
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:29,051
Lorrie, tell them you're not
allowed to talk to anybody.

134
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:30,803
- Look, I can't hear you.
- Lorrie, I...

135
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:32,847
- I can't hear you. Call me back.
- I'm trying to tell you

136
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:34,098
you do not have to talk to anybody.

137
00:08:34,265 --> 00:08:35,933
I can't hear you. Call me back.

138
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,810
Lorrie, I'm trying to tell...

139
00:08:43,566 --> 00:08:44,775
Hey, Captain Sully!

140
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:46,360
- Captain Sully!
- Sully!

141
00:08:50,573 --> 00:08:51,866
How does it feel to be a miracle maker?

142
00:08:52,033 --> 00:08:53,325
Sully, one question!

143
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:55,536
- How did you pull off the impossible?
- Sully!

144
00:08:55,703 --> 00:08:57,913
Captain Sully! Sully!

145
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:00,207
Pardon me.

146
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:03,586
Captain Sully!

147
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:12,178
I'm thinking about
running over the press with the car.

148
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:14,513
Self-defense.
You think a jury would convict?

149
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,973
Just do what you have to do.

150
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:19,185
You know, I'm taking that as permission.
The cops'll be coming after you.

151
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:21,020
Sullenberger couldn't be here.

152
00:09:21,187 --> 00:09:23,189
He is not able to speak to the media

153
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:26,984
while the NTSB
is conducting its investigation.

154
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:29,528
Sully, are you listening to me?

155
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:31,781
Maybe we should talk later.

156
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,993
Honey, it is later.
I've been waiting all day.

157
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,328
Are you okay?

158
00:09:37,495 --> 00:09:39,705
Yeah, just tired, that's all.

159
00:09:39,872 --> 00:09:41,415
How are the girls?

160
00:09:41,624 --> 00:09:42,625
Well, they're...

161
00:09:44,168 --> 00:09:47,463
They're a little overwhelmed.
It sounds like you are, too.

162
00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:49,340
Yeah...

163
00:09:50,216 --> 00:09:51,884
Yeah, well, they'll be all right.

164
00:09:52,051 --> 00:09:53,177
It is a lot.

165
00:09:53,344 --> 00:09:54,595
Yes, it is.

166
00:09:54,762 --> 00:09:55,721
Those missing engines

167
00:09:55,888 --> 00:09:57,556
were definitely not
what investigators wanted...

168
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,309
The whole world is talking about you.

169
00:10:00,518 --> 00:10:01,811
My Sully.

170
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:04,897
God, I just can't believe this.

171
00:10:05,064 --> 00:10:08,067
Lorrie, I have to stay here longer

172
00:10:08,234 --> 00:10:09,902
for the NTSB investigation.

173
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:13,864
Did I tell you that already?
I apologize if I didn't tell you.

174
00:10:14,532 --> 00:10:18,577
There is no need for you to apologize.
You are right where you need to be.

175
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:24,041
I want you to know,
I did the best I could.

176
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:29,880
Of course you did. You saved everyone.

177
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:35,553
Maybe we should
just talk in the morning. I'm tired.

178
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:38,305
I'm overwhelmed by all this attention.

179
00:10:41,225 --> 00:10:42,768
I'm gonna be on TV in the morning.

180
00:10:42,935 --> 00:10:44,812
What are they gonna ask me?
What am I gonna say?

181
00:10:44,979 --> 00:10:47,064
Sully, do you want me to come be with you?

182
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:49,150
No, Lorrie.

183
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:51,777
Thanks, but the girls need you.

184
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:54,238
Tell them I love them.

185
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:57,575
I love you. Get some sleep.

186
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:59,326
Yeah.

187
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:01,912
Hey, maybe when I wake up,
it'll be January 14th.

188
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,247
Wouldn't that be good?

189
00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:06,625
I love you.

190
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:15,843
Why Captain Sullenberger
made that fateful decision

191
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:18,512
to turn the Hudson into a runway?

192
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:20,306
Well, only he can answer.

193
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:24,101
But we now know it was the wrong choice.

194
00:11:24,602 --> 00:11:28,355
A choice that endangered the lives
of all of those onboard.

195
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:32,276
So, while much of the country
hails him as a hero,

196
00:11:32,443 --> 00:11:35,487
this new information will certainly
change everyone's understanding

197
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:40,034
of the so-called "Miracle on the Hudson."

198
00:11:40,201 --> 00:11:45,122
Sully Sullenberger,
are you a hero or a fraud?

199
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:05,976
- Hello?
- Jeff?

200
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:07,686
I'm sorry to call so late.

201
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:10,189
It's okay.
There's no sleep in this room either.

202
00:12:11,357 --> 00:12:14,193
Can you believe they charge
$5 for a Snickers?

203
00:12:15,486 --> 00:12:18,030
I could bankrupt the airline
in about four bites.

204
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,909
Just thought
maybe you would want to...

205
00:12:22,076 --> 00:12:23,077
Talk?

206
00:12:23,244 --> 00:12:24,620
Absolutely.

207
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:27,665
Let's get some air.

208
00:12:28,374 --> 00:12:29,416
Great.

209
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:32,211
All right. Be down there in five minutes.

210
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:39,718
You enjoying the shakes?

211
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:42,179
The nightmares, rapid heartbeat.

212
00:12:42,346 --> 00:12:43,347
A little bit.

213
00:12:43,514 --> 00:12:45,307
Union's offering us counseling.

214
00:12:45,516 --> 00:12:47,518
Yeah. What are they gonna say?

215
00:12:47,935 --> 00:12:49,728
"You were in a plane crash and lived.

216
00:12:49,895 --> 00:12:52,273
"It may have a minor impact
on your day-to-day."

217
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:55,693
I don't like not being
in control of the process.

218
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:57,861
- I want my self back.
- Yeah.

219
00:12:58,362 --> 00:13:00,406
I'm hoping six months from now,
we'll just be laughing

220
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:02,700
about how we got to meet David Letterman.

221
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:07,121
We're doing David Letterman?

222
00:13:07,288 --> 00:13:09,373
Yeah. Right after the next NTSB interview.

223
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:10,582
Letterman.

224
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:13,294
I'm guessing Dave
is gonna be slightly funnier.

225
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,712
This is so surreal.

226
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:16,755
I guess I'm having a little trouble

227
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:19,717
separating reality
from whatever the hell this is.

228
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:21,051
Yeah.

229
00:13:21,218 --> 00:13:23,387
This is two men freezing their asses off.

230
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:27,099
Sully.

231
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,561
Don't worry. You did a great thing.

232
00:13:30,728 --> 00:13:32,896
It's gonna be remembered
for a very long time.

233
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:34,773
Here's the funny thing.

234
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:38,235
I've delivered a million passengers
over 40 years in the air,

235
00:13:39,111 --> 00:13:43,073
but in the end,
I'm gonna be judged on 208 seconds.

236
00:13:46,243 --> 00:13:48,203
Come on. Tomorrow's gonna be a good day.

237
00:13:48,746 --> 00:13:52,166
Computer sims will prove you were right.
We can all put our wings back on.

238
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:53,667
You wanna run?

239
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:55,085
Yeah, let's run.

240
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:00,632
Fucking cold out here.

241
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:02,760
It was obvious.

242
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:04,303
It was a critical situation,

243
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:08,932
losing thrust in both engines
at a low altitude

244
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:13,270
over one of the most densely
populated areas of the planet.

245
00:14:13,771 --> 00:14:18,609
But choosing to land on the Hudson,
that was still a big "if."

246
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:21,362
I was sure I could do it.

247
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:22,946
You were?

248
00:14:23,322 --> 00:14:24,531
Yes.

249
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,202
How do you feel
when people call you a hero?

250
00:14:29,161 --> 00:14:31,455
I don't feel like a hero.

251
00:14:31,622 --> 00:14:34,958
I'm just a man who was doing his job.

252
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:37,878
The right man for the job
at the right time.

253
00:14:39,463 --> 00:14:42,800
You've been flying for what,
nearly 40 years?

254
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:46,011
Forty-two. It's been my life.

255
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,764
My whole life.

256
00:14:58,482 --> 00:14:59,983
Your aircraft.

257
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:02,528
My aircraft.

258
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,502
I'll be busy crop dusting
in the Super Cub rest of the summer.

259
00:15:18,669 --> 00:15:21,338
So, you can take the plane up, I guess,
when you please.

260
00:15:21,505 --> 00:15:23,590
Still six bucks an hour.
I'll consider it lesson time.

261
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:27,261
A pilot never stops acquiring knowledge.

262
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:30,347
You'll make mistakes, everyone does.
Just learn from them.

263
00:15:30,514 --> 00:15:31,849
Yes, sir.

264
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:34,852
And never forget,
no matter what's happening,

265
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:36,520
to fly the airplane.

266
00:15:36,687 --> 00:15:37,813
Absolutely, sir.

267
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:42,276
One other thing,
and this is important.

268
00:15:42,443 --> 00:15:44,778
- Sir?
- You can go ahead and smile.

269
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,406
All right.

270
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:58,375
- I apologize for the perspiration.
- No.

271
00:15:58,625 --> 00:15:59,626
After what you did,

272
00:15:59,877 --> 00:16:01,712
I'd think that Katie
couldn't be too intimidating.

273
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:03,088
It wasn't Katie.

274
00:16:03,255 --> 00:16:06,216
It was the lights and the camera
that she brought with her.

275
00:16:06,717 --> 00:16:08,177
Okay. All done.

276
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,431
That was from my mom.

277
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:13,724
Her name is Brenda,

278
00:16:13,891 --> 00:16:16,643
she says to say "thank you"
and that she's single.

279
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:20,230
Well, you tell Brenda thank you,
but I've got a girl at home.

280
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:23,442
- Lucky woman.
- Thank you.

281
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:00,687
Sully.

282
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:02,940
Sully. Sully!

283
00:17:04,942 --> 00:17:06,652
Sully, where are you?

284
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:09,196
I'm standing here calling your name.

285
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:11,865
What's up with you?

286
00:17:15,327 --> 00:17:17,037
You need to get focused.

287
00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:20,290
Because the media request
avalanche continues.

288
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:21,667
Yeah. Yeah.

289
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:25,128
Larry Rooney volunteered to jump in

290
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:27,339
and ride shotgun with you
the rest of the way.

291
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:29,633
Thought you might need a friend.

292
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,969
He'll take you to today's NTSB meeting.

293
00:17:32,678 --> 00:17:35,305
Airbus completed their
computer simulations as well.

294
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:37,391
Good. Good, that'll help.

295
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:40,602
There's something else.
Arnie Gentile called.

296
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:42,646
He has the ACARS data.

297
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:45,148
The left engine
was still operating at idle.

298
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:48,318
Not possible. I felt it go.

299
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:50,237
It was like we were stopped in midair.

300
00:17:50,404 --> 00:17:52,906
Arnie said there was a chance
it was sub-idle,

301
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:54,866
that it still could've had thrust.

302
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:58,829
I'm just letting you know
since the NTSB already does.

303
00:18:09,298 --> 00:18:10,799
Is retirement next?

304
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:13,760
What's next for you? What's next?

305
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:15,512
Some room, please.

306
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:17,180
Sully! Over here!

307
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,934
Hey, Larry. Good to see a friendly face.

308
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:24,313
Might be the last one you see today.

309
00:18:26,982 --> 00:18:29,484
You've got to be kidding me.
We've been through all this before.

310
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:30,944
Look,
I'm sorry if you're frustrated,

311
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:34,156
but our job is to investigate
how a plane ended up in the Hudson River.

312
00:18:34,323 --> 00:18:35,991
On the Hudson River.

313
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:42,831
Isn't it a little early in the year
to go fishing?

314
00:18:42,998 --> 00:18:45,500
Seeking the facts
is hardly "fishing," Mr. Skiles.

315
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:47,127
Okay,
then here's the most important fact.

316
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:49,588
There's only two people who know
what happened in the cockpit that day

317
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:50,797
and I'm one of them.

318
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:52,174
And we appreciate your perspective.

319
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,302
Why do you even think we're here today?

320
00:18:56,428 --> 00:19:00,015
It's because Captain Sullenberger
did not head back to LaGuardia.

321
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:04,728
Look, I just finished training on the A320
and I can tell you,

322
00:19:04,895 --> 00:19:06,730
the only reason the plane operated
as well as it did,

323
00:19:06,897 --> 00:19:08,440
that the aircraft could land anywhere,

324
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:11,234
is because Captain Sullenberger
turned on the Auxiliary Power Unit.

325
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:13,528
He was simply following the QRH.

326
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:15,155
No. No, he wasn't.

327
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:17,115
He wasn't following
proper procedure at all.

328
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:19,493
And I know, because
I had the QRH in my hands.

329
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:22,579
He switched on the APU immediately
after engine rollback.

330
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:26,541
According to Airbus,
that's the 15th thing on the list to do.

331
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,043
Fifteenth.

332
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:30,879
If he had followed the damn rules,
we'd all be dead.

333
00:19:33,048 --> 00:19:34,800
Maybe that's the part you don't like.

334
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:37,010
You're not used to having
answers to your guesses.

335
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:39,846
Look, what Jeff is saying

336
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:44,142
is that I know the A320,
what it does and what it doesn't do.

337
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:48,063
I have read countless CVR transcripts
of deceased pilots

338
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,816
and I have significant
accident investigation experience.

339
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:53,235
There is no question

340
00:19:53,485 --> 00:19:57,656
that you are a talented, dedicated,
experienced professional.

341
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:00,367
But all the flights you piloted
before January 15th

342
00:20:00,534 --> 00:20:03,870
and every crash you investigated
are not the purview of this investigation.

343
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:07,040
Only US Airways 1549 matters today.

344
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,584
Your union has been advised.

345
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:13,296
ACARS data relayed that the left engine

346
00:20:13,463 --> 00:20:15,340
continued to turn throughout the flight.

347
00:20:15,507 --> 00:20:17,092
Then the ACARS data is wrong.

348
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:18,927
The evidence shows that the left engine

349
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:22,347
was at idle or sub-idle
immediately following the bird strike.

350
00:20:22,514 --> 00:20:25,892
You show me the left engine,
I'll show you dead birds and no power.

351
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:30,272
The left engine was lost in the crash
due to excessive damage on touchdown.

352
00:20:30,439 --> 00:20:32,649
But we can circle back to that later.

353
00:20:32,816 --> 00:20:35,694
Let's just assume that it was,
as you say,

354
00:20:35,861 --> 00:20:38,363
a dual engine loss due to bird strike.

355
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:41,491
Your weight was 151,510 pounds,

356
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:44,661
wind and temperature
north, northwest, 21°.

357
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:48,081
Speed and altitude
200 knots at 2,818 feet.

358
00:20:48,874 --> 00:20:50,292
- Agree?
- Correct.

359
00:20:50,459 --> 00:20:52,502
We were able to run
all the algorithms concurrently.

360
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:57,132
And the resulting computer simulations
of US Airways Flight 1549

361
00:20:57,299 --> 00:21:00,093
show that the aviation engineers
were correct.

362
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:03,430
There was enough altitude and speed
after the bird strike

363
00:21:03,597 --> 00:21:05,974
for a successful return to LaGuardia.

364
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:07,893
Successful?

365
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:10,395
The plane landed at LaGuardia.

366
00:21:10,854 --> 00:21:11,897
Intact.

367
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:13,940
Undamaged.

368
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:16,151
You got that from one computer simulation?

369
00:21:16,318 --> 00:21:17,360
No.

370
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:18,695
From 20.

371
00:21:18,862 --> 00:21:22,199
Including attempts made for
Teterboro runways 1-9

372
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:25,660
and LaGuardia runways 2-2 and 1-3.

373
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:29,539
Every computer simulation
with the exact flight parameters

374
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:33,126
demonstrated that a return
to LaGuardia was possible.

375
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:34,878
And not just possible, probable.

376
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:42,052
Does anyone need to hear
further computer evidence?

377
00:21:44,638 --> 00:21:46,348
Captain Sullenberger?

378
00:21:47,557 --> 00:21:48,809
First Officer Skiles?

379
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:50,769
Not at this time.

380
00:21:51,686 --> 00:21:55,774
I would like to go over
the parameters that were used.

381
00:21:56,691 --> 00:21:58,401
We will make them available to the union.

382
00:21:58,568 --> 00:21:59,569
Thank you.

383
00:21:59,736 --> 00:22:01,530
Once the investigation is complete,

384
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:04,449
we'll be able to share
the actual computer simulations.

385
00:22:04,616 --> 00:22:06,451
For now, they remain confidential.

386
00:22:06,618 --> 00:22:08,495
We cannot afford a leak to the press.

387
00:22:09,955 --> 00:22:12,415
There's been far too much talk
in the press already.

388
00:22:16,711 --> 00:22:19,589
When the complete cockpit
voice recording is compiled,

389
00:22:19,756 --> 00:22:22,968
along with ATC
and all onboard transcripts combined,

390
00:22:23,635 --> 00:22:25,136
we will call you back.

391
00:22:26,596 --> 00:22:28,473
Thank you, gentlemen. Good day.

392
00:22:30,934 --> 00:22:32,102
Thank you.

393
00:22:39,484 --> 00:22:40,735
They're playing Pacman.

394
00:22:40,902 --> 00:22:43,488
You were flying a plane
full of human beings.

395
00:22:44,281 --> 00:22:47,617
Somehow, that's not how I remember it.

396
00:22:48,243 --> 00:22:49,578
It just doesn't seem right.

397
00:22:49,744 --> 00:22:51,746
It's because it's not right.

398
00:22:51,913 --> 00:22:54,457
Sully, you did everything you could
and it was more than enough.

399
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,710
Ask the passengers.

400
00:22:56,877 --> 00:22:59,170
Ask your wife and kids. Ask mine.

401
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:26,573
So what was the first thing
you heard from the cockpit?

402
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,700
- "Brace for impact." Yes.
- "Brace for impact."

403
00:23:29,618 --> 00:23:31,620
Now, ever hear that before
coming out of a cockpit?

404
00:23:31,786 --> 00:23:33,204
No, not ever.

405
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:39,336
Ever hear that in any other
aspect of your lives?

406
00:23:42,881 --> 00:23:44,132
I don't know.

407
00:23:44,674 --> 00:23:46,259
I don't know.

408
00:23:50,138 --> 00:23:52,724
They could take this show away from me.

409
00:23:54,476 --> 00:23:56,561
Jeff was relaxed and funny.

410
00:23:57,145 --> 00:23:58,772
He should be getting
all of our interview requests.

411
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:00,148
Are they paying you

412
00:24:00,649 --> 00:24:02,150
for all this media stuff at least?

413
00:24:02,317 --> 00:24:03,860
It's news, Lorr.

414
00:24:04,027 --> 00:24:05,612
No payment is necessary.

415
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:07,614
I wish the bank felt the same way.

416
00:24:07,781 --> 00:24:09,157
Why? What do you mean?

417
00:24:09,324 --> 00:24:10,575
It's just...

418
00:24:11,743 --> 00:24:15,330
We got another notice
about the space in Butte County.

419
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:19,501
We'll find a tenant.

420
00:24:19,668 --> 00:24:20,835
It just takes time.

421
00:24:21,002 --> 00:24:22,629
Yeah, you've been saying that
for nine months, Sully.

422
00:24:22,796 --> 00:24:23,880
It's still vacant.

423
00:24:24,047 --> 00:24:25,715
The economy has to take a turn.

424
00:24:26,216 --> 00:24:30,971
It feels like if we lose that space,
the next domino to fall is the house.

425
00:24:31,596 --> 00:24:34,015
Lorr, we're not gonna lose the house.

426
00:24:34,182 --> 00:24:35,475
I'm sorry.

427
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:37,268
I'm sorry.

428
00:24:37,477 --> 00:24:39,062
I'm just anxious

429
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:41,898
and I'm alone and not enough sleep.

430
00:24:42,232 --> 00:24:43,233
Yeah, I know.

431
00:24:43,441 --> 00:24:45,610
Not a lot of sleep going on here either.

432
00:24:45,777 --> 00:24:47,612
I'm sorry if I'm adding to your stress.

433
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:50,156
But just tell me
you'll be back in the air soon.

434
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:53,660
Not until the NTSB
is finished with their investigation.

435
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:55,787
We need you flying.

436
00:24:55,954 --> 00:24:58,915
Lorr, if this goes badly,

437
00:24:59,082 --> 00:25:04,087
my career as a safety expert
will end as a website and a business card.

438
00:25:04,254 --> 00:25:06,506
I'm more worried
about your career as a pilot.

439
00:25:10,593 --> 00:25:12,595
What if I did blow this?

440
00:25:13,013 --> 00:25:14,639
What are you saying?

441
00:25:15,515 --> 00:25:19,144
What if I did get this wrong,
so close to the end of my career?

442
00:25:19,936 --> 00:25:23,189
If I endangered the lives
of all those passengers?

443
00:25:23,648 --> 00:25:28,361
Sully, watch the news. You're a hero.

444
00:25:28,528 --> 00:25:31,114
Everyone's gonna have to get used to it,
including the NTSB.

445
00:25:32,615 --> 00:25:34,284
Worst case scenario,

446
00:25:34,451 --> 00:25:37,162
the NTSB lists me as the probable cause.

447
00:25:37,328 --> 00:25:39,956
That's immediate retirement. No pension.

448
00:25:40,623 --> 00:25:41,666
My life's work gone.

449
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:44,961
Okay, you're scaring me now, Sully.
What is going on?

450
00:25:45,712 --> 00:25:49,007
The left engine might have
still been idling.

451
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:51,885
And the Airbus simulations say

452
00:25:52,052 --> 00:25:55,013
I could've made it back
to LaGuardia safely.

453
00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:57,182
But that doesn't make sense.

454
00:25:57,682 --> 00:26:01,644
Doesn't jibe with everything
I felt in the cockpit.

455
00:26:02,353 --> 00:26:04,522
Then why did you do it, Sully?

456
00:26:05,732 --> 00:26:07,484
What, land in the water?

457
00:26:08,485 --> 00:26:10,904
Wasn't that the most dangerous thing
you could have done?

458
00:26:18,161 --> 00:26:20,663
Good afternoon, Gursimran.

459
00:26:22,832 --> 00:26:24,918
The tuna basil
or the ham and cheddar?

460
00:26:25,085 --> 00:26:27,545
Tuna basil, Mr. Sully. Very fresh.

461
00:26:31,174 --> 00:26:33,093
- Thank you.
- Be careful up there.

462
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:35,220
Too cold today. Too much cold.

463
00:26:35,386 --> 00:26:37,722
When are you gonna come fly with me?

464
00:26:37,931 --> 00:26:40,850
When US Air starts flights to Hyderabad.

465
00:26:41,184 --> 00:26:44,521
I will talk to the chairman,
see what we can work out.

466
00:26:46,523 --> 00:26:48,608
- Oh, for heaven's sakes, Diane!
- No!

467
00:26:48,775 --> 00:26:50,443
- It's his birthday!
- Come on! No, Mom!

468
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:52,028
Just a little something.

469
00:26:52,195 --> 00:26:54,405
The suitcase is already overstuffed
with gifts for Will.

470
00:26:54,572 --> 00:26:56,491
It's always fun to get
something from the airport.

471
00:26:56,741 --> 00:26:58,535
Feels like you've traveled, too.

472
00:26:58,701 --> 00:27:00,453
Ma, he's turning one.

473
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:03,373
Don't think he'll be discerning
what gift came from where.

474
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:04,916
But I will.

475
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:06,960
Maybe a snow globe.

476
00:27:07,127 --> 00:27:09,629
Something he'll remember.
Something "New York."

477
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:12,048
Were you this generous when we were kids?

478
00:27:12,215 --> 00:27:13,383
Okay, sweetheart.

479
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:15,885
I'll get you a snow globe, too.

480
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:19,055
Fine. Come on.

481
00:27:30,775 --> 00:27:32,610
- Good afternoon, Sheila.
- Captain.

482
00:27:34,904 --> 00:27:36,239
- Hello, Donna.
- Captain.

483
00:27:36,406 --> 00:27:38,366
- Jeff.
- Hey, Sully. How are ya?

484
00:27:43,204 --> 00:27:44,414
Hey, guys! Jeff!

485
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:45,748
We're not gonna make it!

486
00:27:45,915 --> 00:27:47,083
I've been waiting for a year
for this trip, Dad.

487
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:49,460
I'm not gonna miss this flight.
Just meet us at the gate, okay?

488
00:27:49,627 --> 00:27:51,296
We'll see you there, Uncle Robbie.

489
00:27:53,756 --> 00:27:55,967
Altimeter is verified. 3-0-2-3.

490
00:27:56,134 --> 00:27:58,261
3-0-2-3.

491
00:28:01,556 --> 00:28:03,433
Start checklist complete.

492
00:28:06,936 --> 00:28:08,897
You really think they'll release us?

493
00:28:09,606 --> 00:28:10,773
I've checked the latest reports.

494
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,400
We're clear all the way to Charlotte.

495
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,278
Then steaks.

496
00:28:15,445 --> 00:28:17,155
Del Frisco's. On me.

497
00:28:17,488 --> 00:28:18,781
Never been.

498
00:28:19,115 --> 00:28:20,283
And I hear good things.

499
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:24,245
The rib eye'll break your heart.

500
00:28:25,455 --> 00:28:26,956
I'm more of a porterhouse man.

501
00:28:27,624 --> 00:28:29,918
The porterhouse will stop your heart.

502
00:28:30,585 --> 00:28:32,712
We are now closed
for US Airways flight 1549,

503
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:33,796
service to Charlotte...

504
00:28:33,963 --> 00:28:34,964
Wait, wait!

505
00:28:35,131 --> 00:28:36,424
- You got it.
- Wait, wait, wait!

506
00:28:36,966 --> 00:28:38,134
Hi. I'm sorry.

507
00:28:38,635 --> 00:28:39,969
Spirit sent us.

508
00:28:40,136 --> 00:28:41,971
We got canceled and they said
that we were re-routed.

509
00:28:42,138 --> 00:28:43,431
That you guys had some seats?

510
00:28:43,598 --> 00:28:44,641
Flight is closed.

511
00:28:44,807 --> 00:28:47,310
Wait, see that old guy
limping up right there?

512
00:28:47,477 --> 00:28:49,646
That's my dad. It's an emergency.
He's gotta be on this flight.

513
00:28:49,812 --> 00:28:51,481
What kind of emergency?

514
00:28:51,648 --> 00:28:54,275
- Golf emergency.
- This flight canceled?

515
00:28:54,442 --> 00:28:55,818
Oughta be.

516
00:28:56,694 --> 00:28:58,321
- ID's please.
- Oh, my God!

517
00:28:58,488 --> 00:28:59,489
How many people are traveling?

518
00:28:59,656 --> 00:29:00,782
Three. Thank you.

519
00:29:00,949 --> 00:29:02,492
Nothing together.

520
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:04,327
That's all right.
Hell, I'll fly on the wing.

521
00:29:04,702 --> 00:29:06,829
Here we go.

522
00:29:06,996 --> 00:29:08,289
22A,

523
00:29:08,456 --> 00:29:09,499
6A

524
00:29:09,874 --> 00:29:11,125
and 6C.

525
00:29:11,292 --> 00:29:12,627
- Thank you. Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

526
00:29:12,835 --> 00:29:13,836
Thank you.

527
00:29:14,003 --> 00:29:16,130
- Yes! What!
- Happy ending.

528
00:29:16,506 --> 00:29:19,008
- She gave me the eye.
- You charming bastard!

529
00:29:19,175 --> 00:29:20,343
- Ahoy.
- Welcome aboard.

530
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:21,511
- How's it going?
- Lucky you made it.

531
00:29:21,678 --> 00:29:22,971
- Yeah, no kidding.
- All right.

532
00:29:23,137 --> 00:29:24,305
- Thank you. Sorry.
- Thank you!

533
00:29:24,472 --> 00:29:26,683
- We're in six, Jeff.
- No. That's all Jimmy.

534
00:29:26,849 --> 00:29:28,518
I was up till 3:00.
I gotta get some sleep.

535
00:29:28,685 --> 00:29:29,936
You can sleep here.

536
00:29:30,103 --> 00:29:31,854
Not with you verbally running
the course the whole time.

537
00:29:32,021 --> 00:29:33,773
"I think I'll play
the seven iron on the 9th."

538
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,275
No. Good night.

539
00:29:38,069 --> 00:29:39,737
Sorry. Excuse me.

540
00:29:43,116 --> 00:29:44,701
Here. There you go.

541
00:29:44,867 --> 00:29:46,536
- Thanks.
- Yeah, of course.

542
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,540
Hey, guys, I'm in here.

543
00:29:50,707 --> 00:29:51,791
I'm so sorry.

544
00:29:51,958 --> 00:29:53,209
He likes to throw everything.

545
00:29:53,376 --> 00:29:55,378
That's perfect.
I like to catch everything.

546
00:29:56,296 --> 00:29:57,630
Hey, little man.

547
00:29:58,089 --> 00:29:59,549
I googled you last night.

548
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:03,303
Read all about your company
on your website.

549
00:30:04,637 --> 00:30:05,722
It's impressive.

550
00:30:06,431 --> 00:30:07,432
Thanks.

551
00:30:09,225 --> 00:30:12,353
I thought I was
a good bullshitter, but you?

552
00:30:12,854 --> 00:30:13,938
You could go pro.

553
00:30:14,147 --> 00:30:15,148
Hey.

554
00:30:15,315 --> 00:30:16,899
I'm only teasing.

555
00:30:17,066 --> 00:30:18,151
The site does make it sound

556
00:30:18,318 --> 00:30:20,903
like your air safety consulting business
has got about 100 employees

557
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:24,115
and headquarters in three states.

558
00:30:24,282 --> 00:30:25,658
Then when I dug a little deeper,

559
00:30:25,825 --> 00:30:28,244
I realized it's only you.

560
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,455
Go easy.

561
00:30:30,621 --> 00:30:32,582
I'm just getting it going.

562
00:30:33,249 --> 00:30:34,959
I'm not usually accused
of being a bullshitter.

563
00:30:35,752 --> 00:30:37,754
Don't get me wrong.
Actually, it's a compliment.

564
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,757
Off that website? I'd hire you.

565
00:30:40,923 --> 00:30:42,925
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

566
00:30:43,092 --> 00:30:45,303
Welcome onboard US Airways Flight 1549

567
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:46,846
with service to Charlotte.

568
00:30:47,013 --> 00:30:50,099
Please review the safety instruction card
in the seatback pocket in front of you.

569
00:30:50,266 --> 00:30:52,602
It explains the safety features
of this aircraft

570
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:56,022
as well as the location and operation
of the exit and flotation devices.

571
00:30:56,189 --> 00:30:58,775
Your seat cushion serves
as a flotation device.

572
00:30:58,941 --> 00:31:02,195
LaGuardia ramp, Cactus 1549.
Ready for pushback at gate 21.

573
00:31:02,362 --> 00:31:04,364
Cactus 1549, gate 21 cleared to push.

574
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:05,865
Spot 28, ground for taxi.

575
00:31:13,373 --> 00:31:15,124
Be sure you turn that off.

576
00:31:16,459 --> 00:31:17,794
Tray table up.

577
00:31:34,852 --> 00:31:38,147
Just once I'd like to
get out of LaGuardia on time.

578
00:31:38,689 --> 00:31:41,150
Well, you know the only way to
get out of LaGuardia on time.

579
00:31:41,317 --> 00:31:42,527
Yeah, what's that?

580
00:31:42,693 --> 00:31:44,821
Fly out of JFK.

581
00:31:44,987 --> 00:31:45,988
Funny.

582
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,500
Takeoff minimum fuel quantity verify.

583
00:31:57,667 --> 00:31:58,668
19,000 pounds required.

584
00:31:58,835 --> 00:32:00,169
We got 21.8 onboard.

585
00:32:00,336 --> 00:32:03,047
19,000 pounds required. 21.8 onboard.

586
00:32:03,214 --> 00:32:06,259
Cactus 1549.
Runway 4. Cleared for takeoff.

587
00:32:06,926 --> 00:32:09,011
Cactus 1549. Cleared for takeoff.

588
00:32:15,476 --> 00:32:16,853
TO/GA.

589
00:32:17,019 --> 00:32:18,354
TO/GA set.

590
00:32:42,044 --> 00:32:43,171
Positive rate.

591
00:32:43,754 --> 00:32:45,006
Gear up, please.

592
00:32:46,674 --> 00:32:47,675
Gear up.

593
00:32:58,227 --> 00:32:59,896
Nice view of the Hudson.

594
00:33:00,688 --> 00:33:03,441
I'll never get over
how beautiful it is up here.

595
00:33:04,275 --> 00:33:06,152
Life's easier in the air.

596
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:07,987
I guess it is.

597
00:33:10,448 --> 00:33:11,449
Birds!

598
00:33:20,249 --> 00:33:21,918
Shit.

599
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,461
Yeah.

600
00:33:29,842 --> 00:33:31,511
It's just turbulence, probably.

601
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:32,970
I'll check the cabin.

602
00:33:33,471 --> 00:33:34,639
What do you think's going on?

603
00:33:36,766 --> 00:33:37,767
It's okay.

604
00:33:38,267 --> 00:33:41,604
Everyone, might be a good idea
just to keep your seat belts on.

605
00:33:44,106 --> 00:33:45,858
We got one rolling back.

606
00:33:48,194 --> 00:33:50,446
We have both of them rolling back.

607
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:56,035
Ignition start.

608
00:34:03,376 --> 00:34:04,669
Oh, my God.

609
00:34:06,128 --> 00:34:07,463
I'm starting the APU.

610
00:34:11,634 --> 00:34:13,302
Just double-check your seat belts, please.

611
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:14,470
Seat belt. Relax.

612
00:34:14,637 --> 00:34:15,972
Can I make sure
your seatbelts are fastened?

613
00:34:16,138 --> 00:34:17,640
Make sure
your seat belts are fastened.

614
00:34:20,017 --> 00:34:21,394
Seat belts.

615
00:34:25,231 --> 00:34:28,067
- What do you think that was?
- I think it was a bird strike.

616
00:34:28,693 --> 00:34:30,820
- Then we're going back to LaGuardia.
- Yeah.

617
00:34:31,779 --> 00:34:32,780
Get out the QRH.

618
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:35,074
Loss of thrust on both engines.

619
00:34:35,533 --> 00:34:37,660
Mayday, mayday, mayday.
This is Cactus 1549.

620
00:34:37,827 --> 00:34:38,828
We hit birds.

621
00:34:38,995 --> 00:34:40,830
Maintain 1-5000, Delta 3-3-1.

622
00:34:40,997 --> 00:34:44,417
We've lost thrust on both engines.
We are turning back towards LaGuardia.

623
00:34:44,584 --> 00:34:46,377
Okay, you need to return to LaGuardia?

624
00:34:46,836 --> 00:34:48,879
- Turn left heading 2-2-0.
- 2-2-0.

625
00:34:49,046 --> 00:34:50,506
Which engine did you lose?

626
00:34:50,673 --> 00:34:51,841
Both. Both engines.

627
00:34:52,008 --> 00:34:53,009
- Supe?
- Yeah?

628
00:34:53,175 --> 00:34:54,635
I have an emergency.

629
00:34:56,887 --> 00:34:57,888
What's the report?

630
00:34:58,097 --> 00:34:59,140
Both engines.

631
00:34:59,348 --> 00:35:01,517
- What?
- Both engines gone. No thrust.

632
00:35:03,853 --> 00:35:04,854
All right.

633
00:35:05,021 --> 00:35:07,523
LaGuardia says go to runway 1-3.

634
00:35:07,857 --> 00:35:10,318
Tower, stop your departure.
Got an emergency returning.

635
00:35:10,484 --> 00:35:12,111
1549, bird strike.

636
00:35:12,278 --> 00:35:14,071
He lost both engines.
Returning immediately.

637
00:35:14,238 --> 00:35:15,239
Which engine?

638
00:35:15,448 --> 00:35:17,742
He lost thrust in both engines, he said.

639
00:35:18,284 --> 00:35:21,787
Cactus 1549, if we can get it for you,
do you wanna try to land runway 1-3?

640
00:35:23,414 --> 00:35:25,625
We are unable.
We may end up in the Hudson.

641
00:35:27,543 --> 00:35:29,754
I got an A320 diving for the river.

642
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,589
Al, stack all the inbounds to LaGuardia.

643
00:35:31,756 --> 00:35:33,382
Let's put a hold on the tower, please.

644
00:35:33,549 --> 00:35:34,759
Come on, guys, stay on point.

645
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:35,968
What about over to our right?

646
00:35:36,135 --> 00:35:38,387
Anything in New Jersey? Maybe Teterboro?

647
00:35:38,554 --> 00:35:39,555
Teterboro tower, I need a runway.

648
00:35:39,722 --> 00:35:41,349
Cactus 1549 needs to go
to the airport right now.

649
00:35:41,515 --> 00:35:42,892
Newark tower, what have you got?

650
00:35:43,059 --> 00:35:44,685
You have runway 2-9 cleared and ready.

651
00:35:44,852 --> 00:35:46,228
- You need emergency landing?
- Yes.

652
00:35:46,395 --> 00:35:47,396
Okay, yeah.

653
00:35:47,647 --> 00:35:49,565
Off your right side is Teterboro airport.

654
00:35:53,611 --> 00:35:54,862
Shit.

655
00:35:55,696 --> 00:35:57,406
This is the Captain.

656
00:35:57,573 --> 00:35:59,116
Brace for impact.

657
00:35:59,283 --> 00:36:00,409
Oh, my God.

658
00:36:00,576 --> 00:36:01,702
What?

659
00:36:01,911 --> 00:36:03,454
Brace, brace, brace!

660
00:36:03,788 --> 00:36:06,290
Heads down, stay down!

661
00:36:06,707 --> 00:36:08,876
Brace, brace, brace!

662
00:36:09,043 --> 00:36:11,504
Heads down, stay down!

663
00:36:11,671 --> 00:36:13,631
Cactus 1549, turn right 2-8-0.

664
00:36:13,798 --> 00:36:15,466
You can land runway one Teterboro.

665
00:36:15,633 --> 00:36:16,759
We can't make it.

666
00:36:16,926 --> 00:36:18,469
We're gonna end up in the Hudson.

667
00:36:18,636 --> 00:36:20,596
I'm sorry. Say again, Cactus?

668
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:27,978
Cactus 1549, radar contact lost.

669
00:36:28,479 --> 00:36:29,897
KC, come on over here.

670
00:36:30,064 --> 00:36:33,109
You also got Newark off your two o'clock
in about seven miles.

671
00:36:34,819 --> 00:36:36,362
Don't go in the river.

672
00:36:36,529 --> 00:36:38,114
- Sir?
- Plug in.

673
00:36:41,701 --> 00:36:43,202
Cactus 1549, if you can,

674
00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:45,788
you got runway 2-9 available at Newark.

675
00:36:45,955 --> 00:36:47,790
It'll be two o'clock in seven miles.

676
00:36:48,457 --> 00:36:49,500
Come on.

677
00:36:50,251 --> 00:36:51,627
Please, God.

678
00:36:55,673 --> 00:36:56,882
I'm sorry, Patrick.

679
00:36:57,049 --> 00:36:59,301
He's inbound to Newark, I know it.
He just went off the box to focus.

680
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:00,511
Patty.

681
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,054
He'll come back up.

682
00:37:02,221 --> 00:37:03,931
He's heading to Teterboro.

683
00:37:04,098 --> 00:37:06,016
We need other eyes and ears.

684
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:09,061
Attention, all aircraft
in the vicinity of the GW.

685
00:37:11,105 --> 00:37:12,940
When we come up
around this bend up here,

686
00:37:13,107 --> 00:37:14,859
we'll see the USS Intrepid.

687
00:37:15,025 --> 00:37:16,944
We got an A320 on emergency descent.

688
00:37:17,111 --> 00:37:20,740
Cactus 1549 is low level above the Hudson.

689
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:24,535
This is helicopter 1-6-7, Mike Tango.
I've got eyes on him.

690
00:37:24,702 --> 00:37:26,203
Okay. I got a chopper with visuals.

691
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:28,289
I'm staying on this.

692
00:37:28,456 --> 00:37:29,957
He's out there.

693
00:37:30,833 --> 00:37:34,754
He's headed to Newark, seven miles.
It's only seven miles.

694
00:37:35,713 --> 00:37:41,051
Cactus 1549, this is departure control.
On guard, do you read?

695
00:37:41,802 --> 00:37:43,471
He's going down.

696
00:37:44,346 --> 00:37:46,265
Cactus 1549, do you read me?

697
00:37:46,432 --> 00:37:50,311
Shit! He's going down!
He's gonna hit the water.

698
00:37:51,687 --> 00:37:54,064
- KC, take his seat.
- Sure.

699
00:37:59,779 --> 00:38:00,905
Tester's gonna come down.

700
00:38:01,197 --> 00:38:04,241
Breathalyzer, urine samples,
it's standard.

701
00:38:04,742 --> 00:38:06,702
His voice was so calm.

702
00:38:07,745 --> 00:38:10,206
When he said the Hudson,
I didn't believe it.

703
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,459
This isn't happening.

704
00:38:14,418 --> 00:38:16,921
People don't survive
water landings, Henry.

705
00:38:21,842 --> 00:38:25,805
Pull up. Pull up.

706
00:38:25,971 --> 00:38:27,223
We're gonna brace.

707
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:28,974
Pull up! Pull up!

708
00:38:29,225 --> 00:38:30,267
Thirty.

709
00:38:30,935 --> 00:38:32,102
Twenty.

710
00:38:32,895 --> 00:38:33,896
Ten.

711
00:38:38,234 --> 00:38:39,735
I'd better go.

712
00:38:41,278 --> 00:38:44,031
I am so sorry. I love you.

713
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:47,326
Yeah. I gotta go.

714
00:38:58,087 --> 00:39:00,673
It had just taken off
from New York's LaGuardia Airport,

715
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,925
bound for Charlotte, North Carolina,

716
00:39:03,092 --> 00:39:04,927
and then a mid-air disaster

717
00:39:05,094 --> 00:39:08,264
struck US Airways Flight 1549.

718
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:12,226
It's possible that birds flew into
both of the aircraft engines.

719
00:39:12,393 --> 00:39:16,105
The pilot quickly realized he could not
return to the airport and land.

720
00:39:16,272 --> 00:39:18,107
His options severely limited,

721
00:39:18,274 --> 00:39:21,235
the only place he could go down
was the Hudson River.

722
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:37,126
Choosing to land
on the Hudson, that was a big "if."

723
00:39:37,293 --> 00:39:39,253
Have you had
any troubles at home lately?

724
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,922
Why'd you do it, Sully?
Land in the water?

725
00:39:42,089 --> 00:39:44,341
Sully, you did everything
you could. It was more than enough.

726
00:39:44,508 --> 00:39:48,095
Every computer simulation
demonstrated that a return was possible.

727
00:39:48,262 --> 00:39:50,222
The left engine
was still operating at idle.

728
00:39:50,389 --> 00:39:53,934
There was enough altitude and speed
for a successful return to LaGuardia.

729
00:39:54,101 --> 00:39:56,228
Wasn't that the most
dangerous thing you could have done?

730
00:40:20,419 --> 00:40:22,504
This is Tasty 1-1.
Abort test bombing run.

731
00:40:22,671 --> 00:40:24,298
I have an emergency
flight control malfunction.

732
00:40:24,465 --> 00:40:25,799
Two, join on me.

733
00:40:25,966 --> 00:40:28,010
Roger that.
Two joining on you.

734
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:31,513
- Feels like hydraulics.
- Sir, do we need to punch out?

735
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,224
No, I can still fly.
I'm running a control test.

736
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:36,143
Get the checklist.

737
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:37,519
We have the checklist, sir.

738
00:40:37,686 --> 00:40:39,271
Increasing thrust.
We need altitude.

739
00:40:39,438 --> 00:40:40,731
Hold on, we're gonna climb.

740
00:40:44,777 --> 00:40:46,028
Nellis Tower, this is Tasty 1-1

741
00:40:46,195 --> 00:40:47,571
with an emergency
flight control malfunction.

742
00:40:47,738 --> 00:40:48,822
We need a straight-in approach.

743
00:40:49,865 --> 00:40:50,950
Roger, Tasty 1-1.

744
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:53,494
Turn left 2-0-0 to runway 3.

745
00:40:53,661 --> 00:40:55,829
Unable.
I repeat, I need a straight-in approach.

746
00:40:56,121 --> 00:40:57,122
Okay.

747
00:40:57,373 --> 00:40:58,832
Proceed straight ahead to runway 2-1.

748
00:40:58,999 --> 00:41:00,542
2-1, Tasty 1-1.

749
00:41:03,379 --> 00:41:05,130
Two, I'm decreasing speed.

750
00:41:05,297 --> 00:41:07,132
Clear the board for a damage check.

751
00:41:14,306 --> 00:41:17,017
One, you look clean and dry,
but you're still trailing smoke.

752
00:41:17,184 --> 00:41:19,395
Roger that, Two.
Approach runway 2-1.

753
00:41:19,937 --> 00:41:22,231
One, I'll maintain chase
and follow you in.

754
00:41:30,739 --> 00:41:31,740
I have visual on the runway.

755
00:41:31,907 --> 00:41:33,075
What's our heading?

756
00:41:33,242 --> 00:41:35,577
Heading 0-2-0.
Five miles out, sir.

757
00:41:36,245 --> 00:41:37,830
All right. Gear in three.

758
00:41:42,501 --> 00:41:44,211
Tasty 1-1, check air speed.

759
00:41:44,378 --> 00:41:46,213
Looks like you're coming in hot.

760
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,173
Nellis Tower,
I need speed to maintain control.

761
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:50,259
Avoiding a stall.

762
00:41:53,429 --> 00:41:55,889
One, check your heading.
You're not gonna make the runway.

763
00:41:56,056 --> 00:41:57,099
I got it.

764
00:41:57,766 --> 00:41:59,268
I'm bringing her back.

765
00:42:16,952 --> 00:42:19,246
That was a hell of a landing, sir.

766
00:42:19,413 --> 00:42:21,540
I didn't think we were gonna make it.

767
00:42:50,611 --> 00:42:52,446
I'm gonna start charging you
for this stuff, all right?

768
00:42:52,613 --> 00:42:54,281
- Get out of here.
- You hear me?

769
00:42:54,615 --> 00:42:55,824
- Thanks, Pete.
- Thanks, Pete.

770
00:42:55,991 --> 00:42:56,992
You got any nuts?

771
00:42:57,701 --> 00:42:59,036
- Hey.
- Hey.

772
00:42:59,203 --> 00:43:01,163
Let me know if you need anything.

773
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:03,582
But what still seems so hard to believe

774
00:43:03,749 --> 00:43:06,376
is that everyone
aboard the plane survived,

775
00:43:06,543 --> 00:43:09,546
including two shivering babies
who were found in a life raft...

776
00:43:09,797 --> 00:43:10,798
Hey...

777
00:43:12,174 --> 00:43:13,884
Is that you?

778
00:43:14,051 --> 00:43:16,345
- Are you the pilot? Sully?
- Yeah.

779
00:43:16,512 --> 00:43:18,263
- That is you, right?
- Yeah.

780
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:20,516
Hey, it's a pleasure to meet you.

781
00:43:21,975 --> 00:43:23,894
That was unreal,
what you did the other day.

782
00:43:24,061 --> 00:43:26,355
- That was really something.
- Yeah, he's a hero.

783
00:43:26,522 --> 00:43:28,565
A real pleasure to meet you.

784
00:43:28,732 --> 00:43:30,234
You know, we invented a drink after you

785
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,985
as soon as that happened.
Ain't that right, Johnny?

786
00:43:32,152 --> 00:43:33,946
Yeah, you did. In fact, I'll take one.

787
00:43:34,488 --> 00:43:36,240
The Sully!

788
00:43:37,533 --> 00:43:39,118
It's a shot of Grey Goose

789
00:43:40,744 --> 00:43:42,287
with a splash of water.

790
00:43:42,454 --> 00:43:44,206
Splash of water.

791
00:43:46,458 --> 00:43:48,794
Hey, listen.

792
00:43:49,545 --> 00:43:51,171
To January 15th.

793
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:52,965
Best day of the year.

794
00:43:53,382 --> 00:43:54,383
- To Sully.
- Sully.

795
00:43:59,721 --> 00:44:00,722
Hey, Pete.

796
00:44:00,889 --> 00:44:03,142
Sully's here, and he's there!

797
00:44:03,308 --> 00:44:05,602
Damn, Pete. He's everywhere!

798
00:44:06,436 --> 00:44:07,437
Yeah!

799
00:44:07,604 --> 00:44:08,772
Sully!

800
00:44:10,899 --> 00:44:13,068
You're like a real hero, man.
You know that?

801
00:44:22,161 --> 00:44:24,246
Keep it coming, Paulie.
I'll see you on One.

802
00:44:24,413 --> 00:44:25,414
Agreed.

803
00:44:31,503 --> 00:44:32,671
Twenty-one people onboard, Cap.

804
00:44:32,838 --> 00:44:34,548
Last report says
there's ice out by the GW.

805
00:44:34,715 --> 00:44:36,758
- All right, thanks. Roger that.
- All right.

806
00:44:36,925 --> 00:44:39,344
Twenty-one on the TJ,
departing Midtown, slip Seven.

807
00:44:51,607 --> 00:44:52,608
Unbelievable.

808
00:44:53,483 --> 00:44:54,985
I cannot believe
you have the sack to say that.

809
00:44:55,152 --> 00:44:57,029
That's literally like giving
the entire city the finger.

810
00:44:57,196 --> 00:44:58,197
I'll say it again.

811
00:44:58,405 --> 00:44:59,448
Dennis Eckersley is without question

812
00:44:59,615 --> 00:45:01,742
the greatest relief pitcher
in the history of baseball.

813
00:45:01,909 --> 00:45:03,285
Are you blinded by the leg kick?

814
00:45:03,452 --> 00:45:05,495
Is that what it is? Or is it the mustache?

815
00:45:05,662 --> 00:45:07,372
You're just jealous he was never a Yankee.

816
00:45:07,539 --> 00:45:08,540
Jealous?

817
00:45:08,999 --> 00:45:10,125
Yeah.

818
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:33,315
Now, let's turn to page seven...

819
00:45:46,495 --> 00:45:48,413
Brace, brace, brace!

820
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:49,581
Heads down, stay down!

821
00:45:49,748 --> 00:45:51,250
Let me hold him.

822
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:52,668
- Brace, brace, brace!
- It's okay. Let me hold him.

823
00:45:52,834 --> 00:45:54,002
Okay.

824
00:45:54,169 --> 00:45:56,046
Heads down, stay down!

825
00:45:56,213 --> 00:45:58,215
Brace, brace, brace!

826
00:45:58,382 --> 00:45:59,424
Heads down, stay down!

827
00:45:59,591 --> 00:46:01,677
- We're not gonna make it, Uncle Robbie.
- It's okay.

828
00:46:01,843 --> 00:46:02,844
Brace, brace, brace!

829
00:46:03,011 --> 00:46:04,346
I love you, Mom.

830
00:46:04,513 --> 00:46:06,890
- Heads down, stay down!
- To the moon and the stars

831
00:46:07,057 --> 00:46:08,850
- and all the way back.
- And all the way back.

832
00:46:09,017 --> 00:46:11,687
Heads down, stay down!

833
00:46:37,087 --> 00:46:38,463
What do we do, darling?

834
00:46:53,145 --> 00:46:54,313
Oh, my God.

835
00:46:58,650 --> 00:46:59,860
Evacuate.

836
00:47:02,112 --> 00:47:03,196
Evacuate.

837
00:47:04,406 --> 00:47:05,782
Grab your life vests, please.

838
00:47:05,949 --> 00:47:07,576
Opening forward door.

839
00:47:16,418 --> 00:47:17,836
It's flooding back here!

840
00:47:18,003 --> 00:47:19,463
Rob Kolodjay!

841
00:47:19,629 --> 00:47:21,590
- Dad!
- Go, go, go!

842
00:47:23,592 --> 00:47:26,470
Everyone! The aft exits are unusable.

843
00:47:26,636 --> 00:47:29,014
Move forward to the overwing exits!

844
00:47:29,181 --> 00:47:31,433
And don life vests now!

845
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:43,528
Go! Exit! Go, go!

846
00:47:45,155 --> 00:47:46,156
Move forward.

847
00:47:46,365 --> 00:47:47,366
Move forward to the right
or left exit door.

848
00:47:47,532 --> 00:47:48,533
Jeff!

849
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:49,868
He's back there, can you see him?

850
00:47:50,285 --> 00:47:51,620
Dad!

851
00:48:00,879 --> 00:48:02,297
- Everyone, come forward.
- Jump!

852
00:48:04,716 --> 00:48:07,469
Sir, evacuate the plane right now! Go!

853
00:48:12,516 --> 00:48:13,975
Sheila, the raft didn't deploy.

854
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:20,482
Sir! Come back, sir!

855
00:48:21,733 --> 00:48:22,984
Calm down. You'll be fine.

856
00:48:23,151 --> 00:48:24,486
The rafts are waiting.

857
00:48:29,324 --> 00:48:30,659
Come on, come on, come on.

858
00:48:30,826 --> 00:48:32,077
Hurry up!

859
00:48:32,244 --> 00:48:33,829
It's gonna be bitter out there.
Here you go.

860
00:48:33,995 --> 00:48:36,748
Here. Gonna be bitter out there.

861
00:48:38,959 --> 00:48:39,960
Slowly.

862
00:48:40,168 --> 00:48:41,420
You need to get off this plane now.

863
00:48:41,586 --> 00:48:43,213
Feet first.
Slide slowly and gently.

864
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:45,048
- Plenty of room.
- Come on, people.

865
00:48:49,594 --> 00:48:52,722
Okay. It's good now. Jump! Jump!

866
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:10,240
Oh, my God. Is that gas?

867
00:49:11,408 --> 00:49:12,534
We have to jump.

868
00:49:12,951 --> 00:49:14,202
No, no, no, wait!

869
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,047
You seeing this?

870
00:49:26,214 --> 00:49:28,425
Yeah. Holy Christ, that's a plane.

871
00:49:28,592 --> 00:49:30,927
Deploy that
man overboard ladder right away.

872
00:49:31,094 --> 00:49:32,262
All right, I'm on it.

873
00:49:32,471 --> 00:49:33,555
Shit.

874
00:49:34,389 --> 00:49:35,640
Mayday, mayday, mayday.

875
00:49:35,807 --> 00:49:38,393
Coast Guard sector New York,
channel 1-6, Thomas Jefferson.

876
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:41,646
We have a passenger airliner
in the north river.

877
00:49:41,813 --> 00:49:44,107
We're en route. We will advise.

878
00:49:44,566 --> 00:49:46,985
Let's go, let's go!

879
00:50:02,083 --> 00:50:04,836
Jimmy, Jeff's still on that plane!

880
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:06,671
We can't leave him there!

881
00:50:06,838 --> 00:50:08,423
Robbie, Robbie. Robbie!

882
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:10,800
Robbie! The crew will grab him, okay?

883
00:50:10,967 --> 00:50:12,260
- The crew will get him, okay?
- He's in there!

884
00:50:12,427 --> 00:50:15,013
He'll be okay. He'll be okay.

885
00:50:15,347 --> 00:50:18,099
I'm okay, Mom. I'm okay.

886
00:50:21,436 --> 00:50:22,771
- Ma!
- Just leave me.

887
00:50:22,938 --> 00:50:24,773
Keep moving forward!

888
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:26,608
Follow your instructions.

889
00:50:26,775 --> 00:50:28,610
- It's all right.
- There's water in the back.

890
00:50:28,777 --> 00:50:30,153
- We're doing fine.
- Come on. Let's get out!

891
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:32,614
One after another. Keep moving forward.
Keep moving forward.

892
00:50:32,781 --> 00:50:34,282
This way. I'll help you out.

893
00:50:34,449 --> 00:50:35,575
You go ahead, sweetheart.

894
00:50:35,784 --> 00:50:36,785
Come on. She can't move.

895
00:50:36,952 --> 00:50:38,078
- Sir! Can you come help us?
- Yes, ma'am?

896
00:50:38,245 --> 00:50:39,246
Right there.

897
00:50:39,412 --> 00:50:41,790
Here's a floatation device.
Take that.

898
00:50:42,666 --> 00:50:44,793
Everyone, keep moving forward.

899
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,753
Over the wings.

900
00:50:48,088 --> 00:50:50,423
If you have a life vest, put it on!

901
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:53,093
All series near the Intrepid,
plane down.

902
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:56,346
We got passengers on the wings.
Approach with caution.

903
00:51:01,226 --> 00:51:02,936
Stay calm and you'll all get out.

904
00:51:04,437 --> 00:51:05,438
Thank you.

905
00:51:07,732 --> 00:51:09,192
Move forward, move forward.

906
00:51:15,907 --> 00:51:17,033
Come on!

907
00:51:17,784 --> 00:51:18,952
Come on!

908
00:51:26,334 --> 00:51:27,919
Put a blanket on her leg.

909
00:51:28,169 --> 00:51:29,671
She needs a tourniquet.

910
00:51:29,838 --> 00:51:31,798
You're gonna be fine, honey. Go slow.

911
00:51:32,257 --> 00:51:33,550
Go slowly. Blanket.

912
00:51:34,384 --> 00:51:36,803
Wrap this around her leg. Make it tight.

913
00:51:38,555 --> 00:51:40,557
It's so cold out here.

914
00:51:43,435 --> 00:51:45,353
Get those first-aid kits
up to the bow

915
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,272
and get some extra life jackets out there.

916
00:51:47,564 --> 00:51:49,441
We're here! We're here!

917
00:51:52,485 --> 00:51:54,279
It's all right. We're here.

918
00:51:59,868 --> 00:52:01,161
Give me a countdown, Victor.

919
00:52:01,328 --> 00:52:02,704
All right.

920
00:52:04,164 --> 00:52:05,165
Three,

921
00:52:05,832 --> 00:52:07,042
two...

922
00:52:08,376 --> 00:52:10,045
We're good. We're good.

923
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:13,131
Come on, buddy.

924
00:52:15,258 --> 00:52:17,510
Hold it right there, baby. Come on.

925
00:52:17,677 --> 00:52:18,887
Easy. Go easy.

926
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,600
Come on. One at a time.

927
00:52:25,602 --> 00:52:27,395
We're gonna get everybody, guys.

928
00:52:59,761 --> 00:53:02,931
This is Yogi Berra.
We're 30 seconds out.

929
00:53:03,098 --> 00:53:06,726
With a water temperature of 36 degrees
and a wind chill of minus 5,

930
00:53:06,893 --> 00:53:09,771
the surviving passengers of Flight 1549

931
00:53:09,938 --> 00:53:12,273
literally have minutes to live.

932
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:15,110
We're five out.
We have visual on aircraft.

933
00:53:20,323 --> 00:53:21,324
All right, give me your hand.

934
00:53:21,491 --> 00:53:23,827
If anybody's got any problems,
just wait down there.

935
00:53:23,993 --> 00:53:26,579
We got some really good people
coming on their way, all right?

936
00:53:40,301 --> 00:53:41,845
Stand by.

937
00:53:48,059 --> 00:53:50,186
Fifty yards, go!

938
00:54:04,743 --> 00:54:05,827
You okay?

939
00:54:05,994 --> 00:54:07,912
I got you. You're gonna be okay.
All right?

940
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:09,080
Got you.

941
00:54:11,791 --> 00:54:13,376
Is anyone still here? Come forward.

942
00:54:13,543 --> 00:54:15,086
Captain! Come back!

943
00:54:15,253 --> 00:54:16,713
Come forward!

944
00:54:21,342 --> 00:54:23,344
We need to get off the plane now.

945
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:33,354
Captain!

946
00:54:34,689 --> 00:54:37,108
Captain! We have to go!

947
00:54:37,275 --> 00:54:39,277
It's time to get off the plane, right now!

948
00:54:49,996 --> 00:54:53,166
All right, you guys go. Go.
I'll be right behind you.

949
00:55:06,805 --> 00:55:08,681
Sully, we gotta go.

950
00:55:22,821 --> 00:55:23,822
Thank you.

951
00:55:27,992 --> 00:55:30,829
Everybody's okay.
Help is on the way.

952
00:55:32,705 --> 00:55:35,333
Twenty-six passengers
going to Port Imperial.

953
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:37,502
Nineteen headed to Pier 81.

954
00:55:37,669 --> 00:55:41,130
We got 24 passengers onboard
headed to Port Imperial.

955
00:55:41,297 --> 00:55:43,258
Whoever has miraculously survived

956
00:55:43,424 --> 00:55:45,552
this plummet from the skies
into the icy Hudson

957
00:55:45,718 --> 00:55:48,763
has about 300 of New York's finest
ready to help them.

958
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:52,183
The only question remaining
is will it be too late?

959
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:54,644
In Manhattan, Bobby Cuza, New York One.

960
00:55:54,811 --> 00:55:55,937
Come on, sir. Give me your hand.

961
00:55:56,104 --> 00:55:57,105
Grab on.

962
00:55:57,272 --> 00:55:58,898
Give me your hand, sir. It's okay.

963
00:55:59,107 --> 00:56:00,525
We got you.

964
00:56:02,235 --> 00:56:03,903
- My hands.
- Gotta warm them up.

965
00:56:04,362 --> 00:56:05,947
Get him a blanket, fast.

966
00:56:13,705 --> 00:56:15,373
I was sure I was gonna die.

967
00:56:15,957 --> 00:56:18,167
Hey, no one dies today.

968
00:56:22,422 --> 00:56:23,715
Give me your hand.

969
00:56:30,221 --> 00:56:32,640
Here you go, Captain. This way.

970
00:56:33,975 --> 00:56:35,143
Give us your hand, sir.

971
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:36,644
Sully, wrap it around your arms.

972
00:56:38,146 --> 00:56:39,647
- Climb out now.
- Give me your hand.

973
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:47,113
Can we get
a couple more blankets over here?

974
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:48,281
Thank you.

975
00:56:48,489 --> 00:56:50,742
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

976
00:56:51,242 --> 00:56:52,285
Give him some room.

977
00:56:52,452 --> 00:56:53,703
You're welcome.

978
00:57:15,308 --> 00:57:16,351
Hello?

979
00:57:16,517 --> 00:57:18,311
I wanted to call to say I'm okay.

980
00:57:18,478 --> 00:57:20,355
Good. Are you still on the 5:50 home?

981
00:57:20,521 --> 00:57:21,648
There's been an incident.

982
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:24,859
I'm okay, not a scratch somehow.

983
00:57:25,318 --> 00:57:26,611
Turn on the television.

984
00:57:26,861 --> 00:57:29,030
What do you mean "Turn on the television"?

985
00:57:29,364 --> 00:57:30,698
Lorrie, I can't talk right now.

986
00:57:30,865 --> 00:57:33,034
I will call you from the pier
when things quiet down.

987
00:57:34,535 --> 00:57:37,163
I had to land in the Hudson.

988
00:57:38,373 --> 00:57:40,541
Sully, I don't understand.

989
00:57:40,959 --> 00:57:44,545
I love you, and I'm okay.
Tell the girls I am okay.

990
00:57:46,381 --> 00:57:48,007
But I have to go.

991
00:57:50,134 --> 00:57:51,719
Girls, turn on the TV.

992
00:57:54,389 --> 00:57:56,516
An extensive rescue effort is underway

993
00:57:56,683 --> 00:57:59,894
after a US Airways Flight
crashes into the Hudson River,

994
00:58:00,061 --> 00:58:02,605
- sending passengers scrambling for safety.
- Oh, my God.

995
00:58:24,252 --> 00:58:25,545
If you have any wet clothing on,
take it off

996
00:58:25,712 --> 00:58:27,922
and wrap up in a blanket
from the Red Cross.

997
00:58:38,433 --> 00:58:40,435
You're gonna be okay. Okay, Lucille?

998
00:58:40,601 --> 00:58:43,062
I'm gonna take you right
to the ambulance, all right?

999
00:58:45,982 --> 00:58:48,276
Maybe he's here.
Maybe he beat us somehow.

1000
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:51,696
There's lots of boats! Jeff!

1001
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:55,241
Sully!

1002
00:58:55,491 --> 00:58:56,534
Dan!

1003
00:59:00,204 --> 00:59:03,875
Dan, I need to know who's hurt
and how badly, and I need a count.

1004
00:59:04,042 --> 00:59:06,669
155, that's my number.
That's passengers and crew.

1005
00:59:06,836 --> 00:59:08,337
Okay. How are you?

1006
00:59:08,504 --> 00:59:11,049
I'll answer that question
when we've counted 155.

1007
00:59:11,215 --> 00:59:12,300
All right.

1008
00:59:12,467 --> 00:59:14,260
Honey, it's me.

1009
00:59:15,344 --> 00:59:17,513
Sort of. I won't be home tonight.

1010
00:59:19,348 --> 00:59:22,018
Sherri, I cannot believe
I am talking to you.

1011
00:59:28,524 --> 00:59:31,194
Captain. I'm here to escort you
to meet with Mayor Bloomberg

1012
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:32,904
and Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly.

1013
00:59:33,071 --> 00:59:34,947
If the Mayor wants to say hello,
he'll have to come down here.

1014
00:59:35,114 --> 00:59:36,115
We're still working.

1015
00:59:36,282 --> 00:59:38,409
Sully, I can keep assembling the count.

1016
00:59:39,035 --> 00:59:40,036
Jeff.

1017
00:59:40,203 --> 00:59:42,205
Jeff, I need a count.
We've gotta have a count.

1018
00:59:42,371 --> 00:59:43,664
There's no way to get
a real count out here, Sully.

1019
00:59:44,248 --> 00:59:45,249
Sully, Jeff's right.

1020
00:59:45,416 --> 00:59:47,251
Let's get you in some dry clothes
before you freeze to death.

1021
00:59:47,418 --> 00:59:50,004
Captain, what if the Mayor and Chief Kelly
come down here to meet with you?

1022
00:59:50,296 --> 00:59:52,173
Dan, because it was a domestic flight...

1023
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:53,674
Yeah, we got no manifest.

1024
00:59:53,841 --> 00:59:56,552
We're gonna have to track
the passenger information down one by one.

1025
00:59:56,719 --> 00:59:58,012
- Can you help?
- Yeah.

1026
00:59:58,179 --> 00:59:59,847
I'm gonna call John Carey.
We're gonna get you a count.

1027
01:00:00,264 --> 01:00:02,850
But, Sully, listen. You've done enough.
Let me take it from here.

1028
01:00:14,487 --> 01:00:16,572
- Jeff?
- Pop!

1029
01:00:16,739 --> 01:00:17,824
I'm okay.

1030
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:19,992
I was on the other wing.
They brought us to Jersey.

1031
01:00:20,409 --> 01:00:23,412
I couldn't see you. I couldn't find you.

1032
01:00:23,579 --> 01:00:25,373
I could hear you shouting
my name the whole time.

1033
01:00:26,624 --> 01:00:28,376
I shouted back. I guess the river...

1034
01:00:28,876 --> 01:00:29,877
Are you okay?

1035
01:00:30,044 --> 01:00:31,337
I love you, son.

1036
01:00:33,131 --> 01:00:34,924
I love you, too.

1037
01:00:35,883 --> 01:00:37,552
Can you believe we made it?

1038
01:00:40,012 --> 01:00:41,722
I mean, the plane crashed

1039
01:00:41,889 --> 01:00:43,683
on the river!

1040
01:00:43,975 --> 01:00:45,434
Are you kidding me?

1041
01:00:49,647 --> 01:00:50,648
So unbelievable.

1042
01:01:08,332 --> 01:01:11,502
I've never been so happy
to be in New York in my life.

1043
01:01:23,014 --> 01:01:24,015
Hey, Patty.

1044
01:01:24,307 --> 01:01:25,600
Supe sent me looking for you.

1045
01:01:25,766 --> 01:01:27,226
Everyone's going nuts up top.

1046
01:01:27,393 --> 01:01:29,604
- Aren't you coming?
- I guess you didn't hear.

1047
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:32,231
I lost Cactus 1549 in the Hudson.

1048
01:01:32,982 --> 01:01:36,152
I guess you haven't heard.
He landed the son of a bitch!

1049
01:01:36,444 --> 01:01:37,695
What?

1050
01:01:37,862 --> 01:01:40,281
Everyone's been pulled off.
It's a miracle!

1051
01:01:40,448 --> 01:01:42,325
I thought I lost them all.

1052
01:01:42,491 --> 01:01:44,619
- They've got to get a TV in here.
- Yeah. Seriously.

1053
01:01:47,079 --> 01:01:49,248
What is my pulse rate?

1054
01:01:49,832 --> 01:01:51,459
It's 110.

1055
01:01:52,168 --> 01:01:54,045
My normal resting is 55.

1056
01:01:54,212 --> 01:01:55,421
110...

1057
01:01:56,255 --> 01:01:57,548
That's not good.

1058
01:01:57,715 --> 01:02:00,259
You are right. 110 is not good.

1059
01:02:00,426 --> 01:02:03,721
After what you just went through,
110 is extraordinary.

1060
01:02:03,888 --> 01:02:05,681
How is Doreen?

1061
01:02:05,848 --> 01:02:07,266
Fairly severe laceration.

1062
01:02:07,433 --> 01:02:09,060
But we'll keep her a day or two
to stem the infection.

1063
01:02:09,227 --> 01:02:10,353
But she'll be okay?

1064
01:02:10,519 --> 01:02:12,897
She'll have a scar
and a hell of a story to tell.

1065
01:02:13,064 --> 01:02:14,065
Although no one'll believe her.

1066
01:02:14,232 --> 01:02:16,525
Hell, I'm standing here with you right now
and I don't believe it.

1067
01:02:16,692 --> 01:02:18,361
You landed a plane on the Hudson.
Not a scratch on you.

1068
01:02:18,527 --> 01:02:19,570
Arnie.

1069
01:02:20,947 --> 01:02:23,741
The union is pulling out
all the big guns today, huh?

1070
01:02:25,243 --> 01:02:26,577
Talked to Dan Britt, Sully.

1071
01:02:27,662 --> 01:02:28,955
Got a count.

1072
01:02:29,956 --> 01:02:31,249
155.

1073
01:02:33,918 --> 01:02:35,169
155.

1074
01:02:35,336 --> 01:02:36,504
It's official.

1075
01:02:36,754 --> 01:02:38,756
- 155.
- 155.

1076
01:02:42,927 --> 01:02:44,303
155.

1077
01:02:44,929 --> 01:02:46,555
Thank you, Arnie.

1078
01:03:18,421 --> 01:03:20,298
- Hey, Carl.
- Jeff.

1079
01:03:21,424 --> 01:03:22,800
- Sully.
- Carl.

1080
01:03:22,967 --> 01:03:24,719
Hell of a thing you pulled off
out there today.

1081
01:03:24,885 --> 01:03:25,928
Well, we're here.

1082
01:03:26,095 --> 01:03:27,972
It's about all I know at the moment.

1083
01:03:28,431 --> 01:03:30,057
This is Ms. May, with the hotel.

1084
01:03:30,224 --> 01:03:31,642
Wanted to have a quick word with you.

1085
01:03:31,809 --> 01:03:33,060
I won't take your time, gentlemen.

1086
01:03:33,227 --> 01:03:34,312
This is only to say that my staff and I

1087
01:03:34,478 --> 01:03:35,730
are committed to protecting your privacy.

1088
01:03:35,896 --> 01:03:38,399
So, if there's anything I can do at all...

1089
01:03:38,566 --> 01:03:41,736
If it's possible, I'd love to have
my uniform dry-cleaned overnight.

1090
01:03:41,902 --> 01:03:43,321
It's the only clothing that I have.

1091
01:03:43,487 --> 01:03:44,488
Dry-cleaning?

1092
01:03:44,655 --> 01:03:46,240
If it's too much... If it's too late...

1093
01:03:46,407 --> 01:03:47,575
Are you kidding?

1094
01:03:47,742 --> 01:03:50,619
Captain Sullenberger,
I'd give you this whole hotel if I could.

1095
01:03:53,331 --> 01:03:54,415
Okay.

1096
01:03:55,458 --> 01:03:57,585
Well, thank you, Evelyn.
Thank you very much.

1097
01:03:57,752 --> 01:03:59,587
- Anything for Sully.
- Okay.

1098
01:03:59,754 --> 01:04:01,172
Have a blessed day.

1099
01:04:03,591 --> 01:04:04,967
What just happened?

1100
01:04:05,134 --> 01:04:07,345
You just got hugged by a total stranger.

1101
01:04:08,763 --> 01:04:10,264
Come on, Sully.

1102
01:04:10,431 --> 01:04:12,433
When's the last time you heard of someone

1103
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:14,602
landing a jet plane on the water

1104
01:04:15,102 --> 01:04:16,437
and everybody lived?

1105
01:04:18,939 --> 01:04:19,940
Exactly.

1106
01:04:20,441 --> 01:04:24,111
I got shaving cream,
razor blades, toothpaste.

1107
01:04:25,488 --> 01:04:27,281
And new clothes.

1108
01:04:28,783 --> 01:04:30,826
What, did you think we were ninjas?

1109
01:04:30,993 --> 01:04:32,661
Kmart was the only store open.

1110
01:04:32,828 --> 01:04:33,996
It's Queens. It's 10:00 in the evening.

1111
01:04:34,163 --> 01:04:36,624
- You find a Brooks Brothers.
- Yeah.

1112
01:04:38,125 --> 01:04:39,126
Sully.

1113
01:04:39,794 --> 01:04:41,545
What are you even still doing in uniform?

1114
01:04:41,796 --> 01:04:43,547
You know, I don't know.

1115
01:04:43,714 --> 01:04:47,301
Look, guys. It's been a long day.
Why don't you get some rest?

1116
01:04:47,468 --> 01:04:51,305
Mike Cleary will be over in the a.m.
and make sure you're both doing okay.

1117
01:04:52,139 --> 01:04:54,266
- Thank you, Carl.
- Yeah, thank you, Captain.

1118
01:04:55,059 --> 01:04:57,478
It's been a while since
New York had news this good.

1119
01:04:59,271 --> 01:05:00,523
Especially with an airplane in it.

1120
01:05:10,366 --> 01:05:11,826
I'll see you later, Sully.

1121
01:05:34,265 --> 01:05:37,601
The word city officials
keep repeating is "timing."

1122
01:05:37,768 --> 01:05:40,896
The perfect timing of the NYPD scuba units

1123
01:05:41,063 --> 01:05:43,065
and of the ferry boat captains,

1124
01:05:43,232 --> 01:05:47,403
and of course, the inexplicably
precise timing of the pilot.

1125
01:05:47,570 --> 01:05:50,948
Captain "Sully" Sullenberger,
who, with almost no time,

1126
01:05:51,115 --> 01:05:53,367
became a man for all time.

1127
01:05:53,617 --> 01:05:54,618
This is Kristine Johnson...

1128
01:05:54,827 --> 01:05:55,828
The timing.

1129
01:05:56,036 --> 01:05:57,580
...reporting live from the Hudson River.

1130
01:05:57,788 --> 01:05:58,789
New York One Minute.

1131
01:05:58,998 --> 01:06:00,916
The coast guard released this new video
of Flight 1549

1132
01:06:01,167 --> 01:06:03,127
making its emergency landing
on the Hudson.

1133
01:06:03,294 --> 01:06:06,213
Meanwhile, the search is launched
for the engine of the aircraft.

1134
01:06:08,966 --> 01:06:10,551
Hey, Sully. Let me...

1135
01:06:17,725 --> 01:06:19,101
Come on. Answer.

1136
01:06:19,810 --> 01:06:20,936
Answer!

1137
01:06:21,770 --> 01:06:25,441
Larry, the CVR is in two days.
How fast can you arrange a favor?

1138
01:06:25,691 --> 01:06:26,734
Sully?

1139
01:06:26,942 --> 01:06:30,571
I know that Airbus has simulations
scheduled for the S22 sim at the factory.

1140
01:06:30,738 --> 01:06:34,325
But that's next week in Toulouse.
Can you get them to reschedule?

1141
01:06:34,492 --> 01:06:35,743
It's 1:30 in the morning.

1142
01:06:35,910 --> 01:06:37,036
I need you to make it happen

1143
01:06:37,244 --> 01:06:38,621
before we listen to the CVR.

1144
01:06:38,787 --> 01:06:40,748
Before our testimony is complete.

1145
01:06:40,915 --> 01:06:42,082
Why?

1146
01:06:42,750 --> 01:06:45,628
I have a right to see the simulations
and I have a feeling that

1147
01:06:45,794 --> 01:06:49,173
with human pilots and not a computer,
the results are going to be different.

1148
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:51,759
What if they show the exact same result?

1149
01:06:53,093 --> 01:06:55,262
If they do,
then I'll hand you my wings myself.

1150
01:06:55,429 --> 01:06:56,805
It's all about the timing, Larry.

1151
01:06:56,972 --> 01:06:58,933
You can accomplish anything
if you're never in a hurry.

1152
01:06:59,099 --> 01:07:00,851
I sure as hell agree with that.

1153
01:07:01,018 --> 01:07:03,312
The CVR is on Wednesday. That's 36 hours.

1154
01:07:03,479 --> 01:07:04,813
Can you make it happen?

1155
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:07,608
I'll try.
It's a lot of phone calls to make.

1156
01:07:07,775 --> 01:07:09,276
It's already 7:30
in the morning in France,

1157
01:07:09,443 --> 01:07:10,569
so you better get started.

1158
01:07:10,736 --> 01:07:12,613
Thank you, Larry. Thank you.

1159
01:07:31,382 --> 01:07:32,383
Hey, Lorrie.

1160
01:07:32,591 --> 01:07:35,678
Hi. I'm sorry to bother you
before the hearing.

1161
01:07:35,844 --> 01:07:38,264
Sweetheart, what happened?

1162
01:07:39,557 --> 01:07:45,271
I realized just now,
for the first time, that there were...

1163
01:07:46,188 --> 01:07:50,192
There were 155 people
on that plane and you were one of them.

1164
01:07:51,569 --> 01:07:53,445
We almost lost you.

1165
01:07:54,071 --> 01:07:57,074
Yeah, but you didn't. I'm right here.

1166
01:07:58,701 --> 01:08:00,494
How are you holding up?

1167
01:08:00,661 --> 01:08:02,204
I'm holding up.

1168
01:08:02,371 --> 01:08:04,248
Please tell me this is almost over.

1169
01:08:04,748 --> 01:08:06,333
It's almost over.

1170
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:07,501
Okay.

1171
01:08:07,668 --> 01:08:08,794
I love you.

1172
01:08:08,961 --> 01:08:10,379
I love you, too.

1173
01:08:10,546 --> 01:08:12,715
I'll call you when they're done with me.

1174
01:08:41,368 --> 01:08:43,329
- Sully.
- Let's go, Larry.

1175
01:08:54,006 --> 01:08:56,342
- Good morning, Sully.
- Jeff.

1176
01:08:56,925 --> 01:08:58,344
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen,
and welcome.

1177
01:08:58,552 --> 01:08:59,720
My name is Charles Porter.

1178
01:08:59,928 --> 01:09:02,556
I've been assigned by the
National Transportation Safety Board

1179
01:09:02,765 --> 01:09:05,100
to conduct this public hearing here today.

1180
01:09:05,392 --> 01:09:07,144
We have a lot of material to cover.

1181
01:09:07,728 --> 01:09:10,397
But before we listen to
the cockpit voice recording...

1182
01:09:10,564 --> 01:09:12,441
And we will be listening to it
for the first time

1183
01:09:12,608 --> 01:09:14,068
along with you, gentlemen.

1184
01:09:14,234 --> 01:09:17,613
Per the request of
Captain Sullenberger and the union,

1185
01:09:17,780 --> 01:09:19,990
Airbus has agreed to link us via satellite

1186
01:09:20,157 --> 01:09:22,242
to today's piloted simulations.

1187
01:09:22,409 --> 01:09:24,078
Upload link, please.

1188
01:09:24,912 --> 01:09:26,580
They're just simulations, Sully.

1189
01:09:26,747 --> 01:09:28,999
Won't change my mind
about what happened up there.

1190
01:09:29,667 --> 01:09:31,418
Might change theirs.

1191
01:09:41,011 --> 01:09:42,054
Birds.

1192
01:09:43,972 --> 01:09:45,599
Number one's rolling back. And number two.

1193
01:09:45,766 --> 01:09:46,934
Auto pilot's off.

1194
01:09:47,434 --> 01:09:49,478
- Pilot off.
- Flight Director's off.

1195
01:09:49,645 --> 01:09:50,813
Flight Director is off.

1196
01:09:50,979 --> 01:09:53,774
All right. LaGuardia, Cactus 1549,
dual engine failure.

1197
01:09:53,941 --> 01:09:55,275
We have to return to the field.

1198
01:09:55,442 --> 01:09:58,112
Okay. I'm gonna left turn
back to LaGuardia 1-3.

1199
01:09:58,278 --> 01:10:00,114
I'll activate the approach for you.

1200
01:10:00,823 --> 01:10:02,366
It's activated.

1201
01:10:02,533 --> 01:10:03,951
Runway 1-3.

1202
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:07,996
Glide slopes coming in nicely.

1203
01:10:08,747 --> 01:10:10,708
- Flaps two.
- Flaps two.

1204
01:10:12,042 --> 01:10:13,711
Sink Rate 900.

1205
01:10:16,839 --> 01:10:18,549
Too low, flaps.

1206
01:10:19,049 --> 01:10:20,467
Flight slow.

1207
01:10:20,634 --> 01:10:22,136
Too low, flaps.

1208
01:10:22,302 --> 01:10:25,514
Forty, 30, 20...

1209
01:10:33,021 --> 01:10:36,191
Successful landing
at LaGuardia, runway 1-3.

1210
01:10:37,651 --> 01:10:38,652
For the record,

1211
01:10:38,861 --> 01:10:41,864
the pilots and the computer
sims bear the same result.

1212
01:10:43,157 --> 01:10:45,367
Let's try for Teterboro now, please.

1213
01:10:46,493 --> 01:10:48,162
Upload the second run.

1214
01:10:52,541 --> 01:10:53,834
Birds.

1215
01:10:58,589 --> 01:10:59,965
Give me a heading 3-1-0.

1216
01:11:00,215 --> 01:11:01,759
Heading 3-1-0.

1217
01:11:03,761 --> 01:11:05,304
I'm gonna give you direct to Teterboro.

1218
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:06,722
Direct Teterboro.

1219
01:11:14,188 --> 01:11:15,189
One thousand.

1220
01:11:15,898 --> 01:11:17,107
Flaps two.

1221
01:11:17,274 --> 01:11:18,484
Flaps two.

1222
01:11:23,822 --> 01:11:25,574
Too low, terrain.

1223
01:11:25,824 --> 01:11:27,326
Too low, terrain.

1224
01:11:27,618 --> 01:11:28,911
Too low, terrain.

1225
01:11:30,245 --> 01:11:34,291
Fifty, 40, 30, 20...

1226
01:11:38,003 --> 01:11:40,464
Successful landing
at Teterboro, runway 1-9.

1227
01:11:44,593 --> 01:11:48,388
Multiple airports, runways,
two successful landings.

1228
01:11:49,932 --> 01:11:53,018
We are simply mimicking
what the computer already told us.

1229
01:11:53,769 --> 01:11:57,147
A lot of toes were stepped on
in order to set this up for today.

1230
01:12:00,317 --> 01:12:02,945
And frankly, I really don't know
what you gentlemen plan to gain by it.

1231
01:12:03,487 --> 01:12:05,614
Can we get serious now?

1232
01:12:07,407 --> 01:12:08,450
Captain?

1233
01:12:08,617 --> 01:12:10,160
We've all heard about
the computer simulations

1234
01:12:10,369 --> 01:12:12,913
and now we are watching actual sims.

1235
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:15,249
But I can't quite believe

1236
01:12:16,124 --> 01:12:20,379
you still have not taken
into account the human factor.

1237
01:12:20,712 --> 01:12:22,047
Human piloted simulations

1238
01:12:22,214 --> 01:12:24,049
showed that you could
make it back to the airport.

1239
01:12:24,508 --> 01:12:25,801
No, they don't.

1240
01:12:26,468 --> 01:12:29,137
These pilots were not behaving
like human beings,

1241
01:12:29,304 --> 01:12:31,807
like people who are experiencing this
for the first time.

1242
01:12:31,974 --> 01:12:33,600
Well, they may not be reacting
like you did.

1243
01:12:33,767 --> 01:12:35,352
Immediately after the bird strike

1244
01:12:35,519 --> 01:12:37,062
they are turning back for the airport.

1245
01:12:37,229 --> 01:12:39,189
Just as in the computer sims, correct?

1246
01:12:39,356 --> 01:12:40,357
That is correct.

1247
01:12:40,524 --> 01:12:43,819
They obviously knew the turn
and exactly what heading to fly.

1248
01:12:43,986 --> 01:12:45,320
They did not run a check.

1249
01:12:45,487 --> 01:12:46,822
They did not switch on the APU.

1250
01:12:46,989 --> 01:12:49,283
They had all the same
parameters that you faced.

1251
01:12:49,449 --> 01:12:51,076
No one warned us.

1252
01:12:52,202 --> 01:12:55,038
No one said,
"You are going to lose both engines

1253
01:12:55,205 --> 01:12:57,833
"at a lower altitude
than any jet in history.

1254
01:12:58,500 --> 01:12:59,626
"But be cool.

1255
01:12:59,793 --> 01:13:02,170
"Just make a left turn for LaGuardia

1256
01:13:02,337 --> 01:13:04,590
"like you're going back
to pick up the milk."

1257
01:13:05,257 --> 01:13:08,135
This was dual engine loss at 2,800 feet

1258
01:13:08,302 --> 01:13:10,470
followed by an immediate water landing

1259
01:13:10,637 --> 01:13:13,223
with 155 souls onboard.

1260
01:13:13,390 --> 01:13:17,185
No one has ever trained
for an incident like that.

1261
01:13:17,352 --> 01:13:18,353
No one.

1262
01:13:19,396 --> 01:13:22,691
The Teterboro landing,
with its unrealistic bank angle

1263
01:13:22,941 --> 01:13:25,235
we were not the Thunderbirds up there.

1264
01:13:25,777 --> 01:13:28,071
I'd like to know how many times
the pilot practiced that maneuver

1265
01:13:28,238 --> 01:13:30,324
before he actually pulled it off.

1266
01:13:31,617 --> 01:13:33,201
I'm not questioning the pilots.

1267
01:13:33,368 --> 01:13:34,786
They're good pilots.

1268
01:13:35,871 --> 01:13:38,874
But they've clearly been instructed
to head for the airport

1269
01:13:39,041 --> 01:13:40,834
immediately after the bird strike.

1270
01:13:41,376 --> 01:13:44,171
You've allowed no time for analysis
or decision-making.

1271
01:13:44,588 --> 01:13:48,508
In these simulations, you've taken
all of the humanity out of the cockpit.

1272
01:13:49,468 --> 01:13:53,555
How much time did the pilots
spend planning for this event?

1273
01:13:53,722 --> 01:13:55,265
For these simulations?

1274
01:13:58,769 --> 01:14:01,104
You are looking for human error.

1275
01:14:02,522 --> 01:14:04,232
Then make it human.

1276
01:14:09,196 --> 01:14:11,281
This wasn't a video game.

1277
01:14:11,448 --> 01:14:13,200
It was life and death.

1278
01:14:13,742 --> 01:14:15,911
Sully's right. That's worth a few seconds.

1279
01:14:16,078 --> 01:14:18,538
Please ask how many
practice runs they had.

1280
01:14:19,456 --> 01:14:20,916
Seventeen.

1281
01:14:27,089 --> 01:14:28,799
Seventeen?

1282
01:14:30,050 --> 01:14:35,555
The pilot who landed at Teterboro
had 17 practice attempts

1283
01:14:35,722 --> 01:14:38,392
before the simulation we just witnessed.

1284
01:14:43,063 --> 01:14:45,816
Your reaction decision time
will be set at 35 seconds.

1285
01:14:47,484 --> 01:14:49,736
Thirty-five seconds.
That's not enough time.

1286
01:14:50,278 --> 01:14:52,948
We only had 208 seconds total,

1287
01:14:53,907 --> 01:14:55,242
so I'll take it.

1288
01:14:55,659 --> 01:14:56,910
Upload the link.

1289
01:14:57,077 --> 01:14:58,453
Return to LaGuardia.

1290
01:14:58,620 --> 01:15:01,164
Now with an added
35-second delay in response time.

1291
01:15:06,294 --> 01:15:08,171
- Birds.
- Okay, I saw them.

1292
01:15:08,422 --> 01:15:10,298
- Give me 35 seconds.
- Thirty-five seconds.

1293
01:15:17,931 --> 01:15:19,016
Time's up.

1294
01:15:19,182 --> 01:15:20,350
Here we go.

1295
01:15:21,768 --> 01:15:23,020
Flight path vector.

1296
01:15:28,608 --> 01:15:29,693
Going for 1-3.

1297
01:15:29,860 --> 01:15:30,861
Okay.

1298
01:15:31,319 --> 01:15:32,529
Activate confirm.

1299
01:15:32,696 --> 01:15:34,823
All right. You are confirmed.

1300
01:15:36,992 --> 01:15:38,785
We're heading right for the airport.

1301
01:15:47,461 --> 01:15:48,712
Caution, obstacle.

1302
01:15:49,629 --> 01:15:51,131
Caution, obstacle.

1303
01:15:51,465 --> 01:15:53,842
We're about
seven miles from the runway.

1304
01:15:55,802 --> 01:15:57,512
Caution, obstacle.

1305
01:15:57,971 --> 01:15:59,556
Terrain, terrain.

1306
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:02,059
Pull up.

1307
01:16:03,268 --> 01:16:04,269
Pull up.

1308
01:16:05,604 --> 01:16:06,605
Pull up.

1309
01:16:08,273 --> 01:16:09,274
Pull up.

1310
01:16:09,858 --> 01:16:11,693
Too low, terrain.

1311
01:16:12,152 --> 01:16:13,653
We got a little extra speed.

1312
01:16:13,820 --> 01:16:14,821
You want some flaps?

1313
01:16:15,572 --> 01:16:16,990
Too low, terrain.

1314
01:16:17,157 --> 01:16:18,325
No, leave the flaps up.

1315
01:16:20,035 --> 01:16:21,745
Too low, terrain.

1316
01:16:22,037 --> 01:16:23,330
Too low, terrain.

1317
01:16:23,830 --> 01:16:25,040
Too low, terrain.

1318
01:16:26,208 --> 01:16:30,212
Fifty, 40, 30, 20...

1319
01:16:43,767 --> 01:16:45,435
Let's try Teterboro.

1320
01:16:47,521 --> 01:16:48,772
Upload the link, please.

1321
01:16:52,692 --> 01:16:53,735
Birds.

1322
01:16:53,902 --> 01:16:55,570
Auto pilot off.
Flight Director off.

1323
01:16:55,737 --> 01:16:56,738
Hack the time.

1324
01:16:56,988 --> 01:16:58,615
- Thirty-five seconds.
- Thirty-five seconds.

1325
01:17:00,367 --> 01:17:02,035
Engine one and two fail.

1326
01:17:06,373 --> 01:17:07,374
Turn.

1327
01:17:07,749 --> 01:17:08,750
Okay.

1328
01:17:10,877 --> 01:17:12,712
Let's see if we can make it.

1329
01:17:17,092 --> 01:17:18,301
Heading sub 2-9-8.

1330
01:17:18,468 --> 01:17:19,928
You seeing Teterboro out there?

1331
01:17:20,095 --> 01:17:21,263
I do.

1332
01:17:25,559 --> 01:17:27,060
Way too low.

1333
01:17:29,938 --> 01:17:31,731
Obstacle, obstacle.

1334
01:17:32,566 --> 01:17:33,900
Pull up.

1335
01:17:34,901 --> 01:17:35,944
Pull up.

1336
01:17:36,903 --> 01:17:37,904
Pull up.

1337
01:17:39,072 --> 01:17:40,073
Pull up.

1338
01:17:41,449 --> 01:17:42,450
Pull up.

1339
01:17:43,827 --> 01:17:45,954
Not gonna work, not gonna work.

1340
01:17:46,121 --> 01:17:47,122
Pull up.

1341
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:49,416
Pull up.

1342
01:17:49,916 --> 01:17:51,751
Pull up.

1343
01:18:06,516 --> 01:18:09,269
Does anyone need to see more simulations?

1344
01:18:13,106 --> 01:18:15,859
Now that we've seen
what could have happened,

1345
01:18:16,026 --> 01:18:18,445
can we listen to what actually did?

1346
01:18:18,862 --> 01:18:21,823
We will look at all
the results at a later date.

1347
01:18:23,116 --> 01:18:24,326
Elizabeth.

1348
01:18:24,784 --> 01:18:25,994
For the record,

1349
01:18:26,161 --> 01:18:29,664
this is the CVR of US Airways Flight 1549,

1350
01:18:29,831 --> 01:18:32,125
January 15th, 2009.

1351
01:18:32,292 --> 01:18:34,711
Gentlemen, headsets.

1352
01:19:01,988 --> 01:19:02,989
Birds!

1353
01:19:09,871 --> 01:19:11,539
Shit.

1354
01:19:11,873 --> 01:19:13,124
Yeah.

1355
01:19:14,668 --> 01:19:16,336
We got one rolling back.

1356
01:19:19,506 --> 01:19:21,800
We have both of them rolling back.

1357
01:19:26,221 --> 01:19:27,222
Ignition start.

1358
01:19:33,603 --> 01:19:34,896
I'm starting the APU.

1359
01:19:41,569 --> 01:19:43,154
- My aircraft.
- Your aircraft.

1360
01:19:43,655 --> 01:19:44,864
Get out the QRH.

1361
01:19:45,031 --> 01:19:46,533
Priority left.

1362
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:48,034
Loss of thrust on both engines.

1363
01:19:48,326 --> 01:19:50,412
Mayday, mayday, mayday.
This is Cactus 1549.

1364
01:19:50,578 --> 01:19:52,539
Hit birds.
We've lost thrust on both engines.

1365
01:19:52,706 --> 01:19:54,374
We are turning back towards LaGuardia.

1366
01:19:54,874 --> 01:19:56,042
Okay, you need to return to LaGuardia?

1367
01:19:56,209 --> 01:19:57,877
- Turn left heading 2-2-0.
- 2-2-0.

1368
01:19:58,044 --> 01:20:00,463
- Which engine did you lose?
- Both. Both engines.

1369
01:20:10,098 --> 01:20:12,017
"If fuel remaining, engine mode,
select your ignition."

1370
01:20:12,225 --> 01:20:13,560
- Ignition.
- Ignition.

1371
01:20:13,727 --> 01:20:16,104
- Thrust levers, confirm idle.
- Idle.

1372
01:20:16,271 --> 01:20:18,690
Airspeed. Optimum relight, 300 knots.

1373
01:20:19,274 --> 01:20:21,693
- We don't have that.
- No, we don't.

1374
01:20:23,278 --> 01:20:24,988
Cactus 1549,
if we can get it for you,

1375
01:20:25,155 --> 01:20:26,614
do you wanna try to land runway 1-3?

1376
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:31,036
We are unable.
We may end up in the Hudson.

1377
01:20:32,412 --> 01:20:35,206
Emergency electrical power,
emergency generator not online.

1378
01:20:35,373 --> 01:20:36,916
Online.

1379
01:20:37,083 --> 01:20:39,878
ATC notified. Squawk 7700.

1380
01:20:40,045 --> 01:20:41,713
Distress message transmit. We did that.

1381
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:44,758
Cactus 1549,
it's gonna be left traffic, runway 3-1.

1382
01:20:45,258 --> 01:20:46,259
Unable.

1383
01:20:46,426 --> 01:20:47,886
Okay. What do you need to land?

1384
01:20:48,053 --> 01:20:49,137
Wind shear.

1385
01:20:49,429 --> 01:20:51,264
FAC 1 off, then on.

1386
01:21:04,611 --> 01:21:06,780
Been 10 seconds, Captain. Come on.

1387
01:21:06,946 --> 01:21:08,156
Talk to me.

1388
01:21:08,323 --> 01:21:09,532
Cactus 1549,

1389
01:21:09,741 --> 01:21:12,577
runway 4's available if you wanna make
left traffic to runway 4.

1390
01:21:12,744 --> 01:21:14,162
I don't think we can make any runway.

1391
01:21:14,329 --> 01:21:16,289
What about over to our right?

1392
01:21:16,456 --> 01:21:17,832
Anything in New Jersey? Maybe Teterboro?

1393
01:21:17,999 --> 01:21:20,001
Okay, yeah.
Off your right side is Teterboro airport.

1394
01:21:20,668 --> 01:21:23,296
LaGuardia Departure,
got an emergency inbound.

1395
01:21:23,463 --> 01:21:25,006
This is Teterboro tower. Go ahead.

1396
01:21:25,173 --> 01:21:27,133
Cactus 1549 over the GW Bridge.

1397
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:28,593
Needs to go to the airport right now.

1398
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:30,011
Check. Does he need assistance?

1399
01:21:30,178 --> 01:21:32,305
Yes. Bird strike.
Can I get him in for runway 1?

1400
01:21:39,479 --> 01:21:40,563
Cactus 1549, you wanna

1401
01:21:40,730 --> 01:21:41,815
try and go to Teterboro?

1402
01:21:42,982 --> 01:21:44,109
Obstacle. Obstacle.

1403
01:21:48,154 --> 01:21:49,697
Obstacle. Obstacle.

1404
01:21:51,157 --> 01:21:52,158
Pull up.

1405
01:21:52,325 --> 01:21:53,660
Clear of conflict.

1406
01:21:53,827 --> 01:21:56,496
"No relight after 30 seconds,
engine master one and two, confirm off."

1407
01:21:56,663 --> 01:21:57,664
Off.

1408
01:21:58,498 --> 01:21:59,999
"Wait 30 seconds."

1409
01:22:00,166 --> 01:22:01,626
Too low, terrain.

1410
01:22:02,293 --> 01:22:03,378
Too low, terrain.

1411
01:22:04,295 --> 01:22:05,296
Too low, terrain.

1412
01:22:05,964 --> 01:22:07,048
Too low, terrain.

1413
01:22:15,181 --> 01:22:16,683
This is the captain.

1414
01:22:17,308 --> 01:22:18,685
Brace for impact.

1415
01:22:22,021 --> 01:22:23,189
Five hundred.

1416
01:22:30,697 --> 01:22:32,365
Cactus 1549, turn right 2-8-0.

1417
01:22:32,532 --> 01:22:34,075
You can land runway one Teterboro.

1418
01:22:34,242 --> 01:22:35,535
We can't make it.

1419
01:22:35,702 --> 01:22:37,370
Okay. Which runway
would you like at Teterboro?

1420
01:22:37,537 --> 01:22:38,830
Go ahead. Try number one.

1421
01:22:38,997 --> 01:22:40,498
Number one.

1422
01:22:40,707 --> 01:22:42,167
No relight.

1423
01:22:43,209 --> 01:22:44,502
We're gonna end up in the Hudson.

1424
01:22:44,669 --> 01:22:45,670
Too low, terrain.

1425
01:22:45,837 --> 01:22:47,255
I'm sorry. Say again, Cactus?

1426
01:22:48,381 --> 01:22:49,382
Too low, terrain.

1427
01:23:00,894 --> 01:23:03,062
All right, let's put the flaps out.
Put the flaps out.

1428
01:23:03,229 --> 01:23:04,230
Flaps out.

1429
01:23:04,397 --> 01:23:06,024
Cactus 1549, radar contact lost.

1430
01:23:06,191 --> 01:23:08,902
You also got Newark off your two o'clock
in about seven miles.

1431
01:23:09,068 --> 01:23:10,195
Got flaps out.

1432
01:23:10,361 --> 01:23:12,030
Two hundred fifty feet in the air.

1433
01:23:17,660 --> 01:23:19,871
170 knots. Got no power on either one.
Try the other one.

1434
01:23:20,038 --> 01:23:21,039
Try the other one.

1435
01:23:21,247 --> 01:23:22,874
1549? Still up?

1436
01:23:23,082 --> 01:23:24,417
One hundred and fifty knots.

1437
01:23:24,876 --> 01:23:27,253
- Got flaps two. You want more?
- No. Let's stay at two.

1438
01:23:27,420 --> 01:23:28,755
You got runway 2-9 available at Newark.

1439
01:23:28,922 --> 01:23:30,131
It'll be two o'clock in seven miles.

1440
01:23:30,298 --> 01:23:32,091
You got any ideas?

1441
01:23:32,592 --> 01:23:33,593
Actually not.

1442
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:35,220
Terrain, terrain.

1443
01:23:35,386 --> 01:23:36,763
Pull up. Pull up.

1444
01:23:37,388 --> 01:23:38,389
Pull up.

1445
01:23:39,557 --> 01:23:40,558
Pull up.

1446
01:23:41,476 --> 01:23:42,477
Pull up.

1447
01:23:43,436 --> 01:23:44,437
Pull up.

1448
01:23:44,938 --> 01:23:45,939
Pull up.

1449
01:23:50,068 --> 01:23:51,319
We're gonna brace.

1450
01:23:51,653 --> 01:23:52,654
Pull up.

1451
01:23:52,904 --> 01:23:53,905
Thirty...

1452
01:23:58,117 --> 01:23:59,118
Twenty...

1453
01:23:59,494 --> 01:24:00,495
Pull up.

1454
01:24:38,658 --> 01:24:41,661
I need to take a quick break.

1455
01:24:55,883 --> 01:24:57,510
What did you think?

1456
01:24:58,636 --> 01:25:01,347
Hearing the CVR just now?

1457
01:25:03,850 --> 01:25:05,685
Let me tell you what I think.

1458
01:25:07,729 --> 01:25:09,314
I'm just so damn proud.

1459
01:25:11,024 --> 01:25:13,860
And you, you were right there,
through all that distraction.

1460
01:25:14,027 --> 01:25:15,862
With so much at stake.

1461
01:25:18,406 --> 01:25:20,867
We did this together. We were a team.

1462
01:25:22,869 --> 01:25:24,078
Thanks, Sully.

1463
01:25:24,495 --> 01:25:26,581
- We did our job.
- We did our job.

1464
01:25:45,683 --> 01:25:47,685
Hey, you did good.

1465
01:25:48,227 --> 01:25:49,228
All right, folks.

1466
01:25:49,395 --> 01:25:50,772
I'd like to call this hearing
back to order.

1467
01:25:50,938 --> 01:25:52,607
If we could settle, please.

1468
01:25:54,567 --> 01:25:56,069
Take your seats.

1469
01:26:02,784 --> 01:26:04,911
That is honestly the first time

1470
01:26:05,078 --> 01:26:06,913
that I have listened to a crash recording

1471
01:26:07,997 --> 01:26:09,582
while actually sitting

1472
01:26:09,749 --> 01:26:11,417
with the captain and the first officer.

1473
01:26:14,170 --> 01:26:15,672
It's extraordinary.

1474
01:26:17,215 --> 01:26:19,717
That was no simulation.

1475
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:22,136
No, it wasn't.

1476
01:26:23,763 --> 01:26:25,014
Gentlemen,

1477
01:26:25,556 --> 01:26:29,268
I want to inform you that
the left engine has been recovered.

1478
01:26:30,228 --> 01:26:32,605
We just received a comprehensive report.

1479
01:26:35,274 --> 01:26:36,943
There was extensive damage

1480
01:26:37,110 --> 01:26:39,612
to both the guide vanes
and fan blades of the engine.

1481
01:26:39,779 --> 01:26:42,573
Five compressor blades were fractured

1482
01:26:42,865 --> 01:26:46,786
and eight variable guide vanes missing.

1483
01:26:47,412 --> 01:26:49,205
So, no thrust?

1484
01:26:49,372 --> 01:26:50,456
As you testified,

1485
01:26:51,124 --> 01:26:53,292
it was completely destroyed.

1486
01:26:53,459 --> 01:26:55,628
The ACARS data was wrong.

1487
01:27:00,466 --> 01:27:03,261
I'd like to add something
on a personal note.

1488
01:27:03,886 --> 01:27:05,763
I can say with absolute confidence

1489
01:27:05,930 --> 01:27:08,933
that after speaking
with the rest of the flight crew,

1490
01:27:09,684 --> 01:27:12,270
with bird experts, aviation engineers,

1491
01:27:12,645 --> 01:27:15,273
after running through every scenario,

1492
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:17,692
after interviewing each player,

1493
01:27:18,151 --> 01:27:20,611
there is still an "X" in this result

1494
01:27:21,487 --> 01:27:24,157
and it's you, Captain Sullenberger.

1495
01:27:24,323 --> 01:27:29,328
Remove you from the equation,
and the math just fails.

1496
01:27:30,997 --> 01:27:32,749
I disagree.

1497
01:27:34,333 --> 01:27:37,170
It wasn't just me. It was all of us.

1498
01:27:37,336 --> 01:27:40,131
It was Jeff and Donna
and Sheila and Doreen

1499
01:27:40,965 --> 01:27:44,510
and all of the passengers,
the rescue workers,

1500
01:27:44,677 --> 01:27:46,971
air traffic control,

1501
01:27:47,138 --> 01:27:49,515
ferry boat crews and the scuba cops.

1502
01:27:51,642 --> 01:27:53,478
We all did it.

1503
01:27:54,437 --> 01:27:56,522
We survived.

1504
01:27:59,942 --> 01:28:04,030
First Officer Skiles, is there
anything you'd like to add?

1505
01:28:05,531 --> 01:28:07,658
Anything you would have done differently

1506
01:28:08,826 --> 01:28:10,495
if you had to do it again?

1507
01:28:11,537 --> 01:28:12,705
Yes.

1508
01:28:13,331 --> 01:28:14,957
I would have done it in July.

1509
01:29:50,636 --> 01:29:52,305
7F. 11F.

1510
01:29:52,471 --> 01:29:53,472
9D.

1511
01:29:53,681 --> 01:29:54,682
1C.

1512
01:29:54,849 --> 01:29:56,809
- 25B.
- 26B.

1513
01:29:57,101 --> 01:29:59,145
- 10B.
- 9A.

1514
01:29:59,312 --> 01:30:02,231
- 13C.
- 21A and B.

1515
01:30:02,815 --> 01:30:04,483
155 is a number,

1516
01:30:05,067 --> 01:30:08,571
but when you can put faces to it

1517
01:30:08,738 --> 01:30:13,075
and not just 155 faces,
but the other faces,

1518
01:30:13,242 --> 01:30:17,163
the wives, the daughters, the sons,
the fathers, the mothers, the brothers,

1519
01:30:17,663 --> 01:30:19,624
it gets to be a pretty big
number pretty quickly.

1520
01:30:19,957 --> 01:30:21,751
Th is is you r captai n speaki ng.

1521
01:30:26,172 --> 01:30:31,344
I think today was as much and as good
for me and my crew as it was for you.

1522
01:30:31,677 --> 01:30:35,973
And because of the events
of January 15, 2009,

1523
01:30:36,140 --> 01:30:41,604
I'm convinced that we will be joined
in our hearts and in our minds forever.

1524
01:31:37,159 --> 01:31:39,328
I am the keeper of the mail.

1525
01:31:40,079 --> 01:31:43,541
So I read when people
from across the country write to us.

1526
01:31:43,708 --> 01:31:47,336
And I open the letters
that come to our house from your families.

1527
01:31:47,503 --> 01:31:49,088
And I open the Christmas cards.

1528
01:31:49,255 --> 01:31:50,756
So, thank you so much

1529
01:31:50,923 --> 01:31:54,093
for the gratitude that you've
expressed to our families

1530
01:31:54,260 --> 01:31:56,595
and the letters and the cards

1531
01:31:56,762 --> 01:32:00,391
because they really do make
a difference to us as well.

1532
01:32:00,558 --> 01:32:01,892
So, thank you.
