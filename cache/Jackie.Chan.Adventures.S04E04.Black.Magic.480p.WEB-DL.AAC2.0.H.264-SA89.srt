1
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:05,537
Uncle:
We will find next oni-mask

2
00:00:05,539 --> 00:00:11,877
in pacific northwest,
near base of cascade
mountains.

3
00:00:13,713 --> 00:00:16,615
Why did I let you
talk me into this?

4
00:00:16,617 --> 00:00:20,252
You said it yourself,
Jackie, you're too fat.

5
00:00:20,254 --> 00:00:23,422
I said I am too heavy
to climb the totem pole

6
00:00:23,424 --> 00:00:25,858
without risk of
damaging it, Jade.

7
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,793
Heavy, fat--same diff.

8
00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:32,664
Hey! He looks
just like his mug shot.

9
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,635
He will fit snugly...

10
00:00:36,637 --> 00:00:38,771
Upon my face!

11
00:00:38,773 --> 00:00:41,440
Flying squirrel
cracks acorn!

12
00:00:41,442 --> 00:00:43,142
Unh!

13
00:00:43,144 --> 00:00:44,309
Whoa!

14
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:47,146
Jade!

15
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:48,947
Aah!

16
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:42,067
Aaah!

17
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:43,402
Jade!

18
00:01:43,404 --> 00:01:44,703
(Grunts)

19
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:51,043
Hang on!

20
00:01:51,045 --> 00:01:53,212
(Growls)

21
00:01:53,214 --> 00:01:57,015
You there! Chop chop!

22
00:01:57,017 --> 00:01:58,917
Fetch the mask...

23
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:02,754
While I destroy chan.
Hyah!

24
00:02:02,756 --> 00:02:03,856
Yaah!

25
00:02:03,858 --> 00:02:05,924
Unh!

26
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:08,594
Hunh!
Flying dragon corkscrew!

27
00:02:08,596 --> 00:02:09,995
(Grunting)

28
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:16,435
Make it easy on
yourself, kiddo.

29
00:02:16,437 --> 00:02:18,504
We just want the mask.

30
00:02:18,506 --> 00:02:20,806
Then come and get it.
(Echoing)

31
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:28,180
Tohru, is mask removal
potion ready?

32
00:02:28,182 --> 00:02:29,982
Uh, almost, sensei.

33
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:35,787
So, what's the deal with
these oni-masks anyway?

34
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:39,224
You worry about driving.
Let uncle worry about masks.

35
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:50,335
Uh, sorry, dude.

36
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:53,071
Uh, rocks
crush paper.

37
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:55,207
Ohh!

38
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:03,248
Unh! (Growls)

39
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:05,317
Hunh!

40
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:08,620
Wait a minute!
Paper covers rock.

41
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:12,858
(Grunts)

42
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:21,567
End of the line, chans.

43
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:24,903
(Trees falling)

44
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:33,378
Aiyaa!

45
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,614
It...Jostled.

46
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:39,751
(Gasps) Ingredient
for mask removal spell
was very rare!

47
00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:40,886
Ow!

48
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:44,156
Who told you to
drive like hot shot?

49
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:49,094
With no potion,
we must ensure that
no one wears mask.

50
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:50,395
Will do.

51
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:51,563
Hunh!

52
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,233
Hyah!

53
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:57,135
Oof!

54
00:03:57,137 --> 00:03:59,371
Look out!

55
00:03:59,373 --> 00:04:00,505
Captain black!

56
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:03,208
I said look <i> out,</i>
not up.

57
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:06,111
(Groaning)

58
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:08,914
Tiger snatches mask
before it sticks!

59
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,216
Guess again, kitty cat.

60
00:04:11,218 --> 00:04:12,618
Huh?

61
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,987
(Grunting)

62
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:17,022
Captain black's
got game.

63
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,793
Huh!
- Hey!

64
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,797
Unh!

65
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:27,466
Exit's that way.

66
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:29,768
(Yelling)

67
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,173
Happy trails.

68
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:38,243
(Yelling)

69
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:47,953
Captain black,
are you...All right?

70
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:49,488
Never better.

71
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:51,957
(Coughing and sputtering)

72
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:54,993
Finn: Tarakudo's gonna
be one unhappy camper.

73
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:59,331
Well, it ain't my fault.
I was paper.

74
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:01,700
Ahem.

75
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:04,836
What is not your fault?

76
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:07,339
We never had a chance,
big head honcho, sir.

77
00:05:07,341 --> 00:05:09,975
That oni mask,
it's defective.

78
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:12,277
Yeah, captain black's
wearing it,

79
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:14,913
but he didn't
go all dark side.

80
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:16,748
<i>The</i> captain black?

81
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,016
All: Uh-huh.

82
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:22,387
Then we now have
a man on the inside.

83
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:24,256
Whoa!
Captain black.

84
00:05:24,258 --> 00:05:25,624
Your face...

85
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:28,060
Relax.
It's only a mask.

86
00:05:28,062 --> 00:05:29,761
Does it come off?

87
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:31,530
Why would I want it to?

88
00:05:31,532 --> 00:05:32,931
(Grunting)

89
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:36,902
Whoa.

90
00:05:36,904 --> 00:05:39,271
Jade:
He's...Peppy.

91
00:05:39,273 --> 00:05:41,473
But he does not
seem evil.

92
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:45,210
Because captain black's
inherent goodness
is keeping

93
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:47,312
the dark forces
within him at bay...

94
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:50,048
For the moment.

95
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:54,319
But we must remove
the mask before
it corrupts his chi.

96
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:59,358
And to accomplish that,
we must acquire more
spell ingredient.

97
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,426
Apologies, sensei.

98
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:02,894
One more thing!

99
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:04,896
While tohru and I
are away,

100
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:07,632
it is essential
that captain black

101
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:11,737
not learn the full extent
of the mask's magic.

102
00:06:11,739 --> 00:06:16,041
He must not summon
his shadowkhan.

103
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:17,609
So what are we
supposed to do,

104
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:20,278
distract captain hornhead
with videos and board games?

105
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,413
(Alarm sounds)

106
00:06:21,415 --> 00:06:22,681
Code blue.

107
00:06:22,683 --> 00:06:25,384
3 dozen tourists have been
abducted on Alcatraz.

108
00:06:25,386 --> 00:06:26,585
All right,
let's go!

109
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:28,019
Roger that!

110
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:31,757
Take 5, boys.

111
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,859
I'll handle
this one solo.

112
00:06:33,861 --> 00:06:37,195
Uh, maybe that is not
such a good idea.

113
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:38,497
What's wrong, Jackie?

114
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:41,199
don't think
ol' black magic
is up to it?

115
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:51,109
(Grunting)

116
00:06:58,117 --> 00:06:59,684
Help! Help us!

117
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:02,487
Help us!

118
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:10,195
Jade!

119
00:07:10,197 --> 00:07:13,198
You watch
captain black's back,
I watch yours.

120
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:17,436
Help us!

121
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:23,742
Help us! Help!

122
00:07:23,744 --> 00:07:26,711
Oh, captain black!

123
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:28,580
We've never been
formally introduced.

124
00:07:28,582 --> 00:07:30,882
I am tarakudo,
king of all shadowkhan.

125
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:32,017
You may bow.

126
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:34,486
The only king
I bow to is Elvis,

127
00:07:34,488 --> 00:07:38,190
and I don't
see you wearing
blue suede shoes.

128
00:07:38,192 --> 00:07:41,960
And I don't see you
wearing your mask
at full throttle,

129
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:45,530
and I can help you unleash
its true potential.

130
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:47,766
No sale, helium head.

131
00:07:47,768 --> 00:07:51,303
(Sighs)
Oh, well. Plan b.

132
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:53,772
Ha! You'd better
cook up plan c.

133
00:07:53,774 --> 00:07:56,641
I already ate your goons
for breakfast.

134
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,210
He's being
straight, t.K.

135
00:07:58,212 --> 00:08:00,011
We can't beat him.

136
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:01,580
Wait for it...

137
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,056
(Grunting)

138
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,027
Now watch
as the good captain

139
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:18,897
gets in touch
with his dark side.

140
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:23,635
(Grunts) This is black!
I need backup! Now!

141
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:36,381
Shadowkhan.

142
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:37,716
Big ones.

143
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:43,855
(Gasps)

144
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:55,800
I thought these guys
were supposed to be
on our side.

145
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:58,003
Eee-tai!

146
00:08:58,005 --> 00:08:59,137
Aah!

147
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:03,675
Aaah!

148
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:08,980
Black here.
Cancel that backup.

149
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:12,684
Whoa! Captain black
has new recruits.

150
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:17,689
Ahh, things are going
exactly as I envisioned.

151
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:21,059
This is the plan?!

152
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:23,628
You have the right
to remain busted!

153
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:33,738
Jackie, why didn't you
tell me I could summon
these shadow guys?

154
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,174
They're gnarly.

155
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:40,845
Heh heh. Must have
slipped my mind.

156
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,748
(Gasping)

157
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:47,319
Ohh...

158
00:09:47,321 --> 00:09:50,455
These midday swims
are getting to be

159
00:09:50,457 --> 00:09:53,491
quite the habit with you,
aren't they, hak foo?

160
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:57,963
Uhh...Black has
beaten us...Again!

161
00:09:57,965 --> 00:10:01,099
Calm down. By summoning
his shadowkhan,

162
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:04,069
black has sealed
his promotion from captain

163
00:10:04,071 --> 00:10:06,638
to demon general.

164
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:16,081
Where did
all the agents go?

165
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:18,550
Black: Mandatory
leave of absence.

166
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:25,256
Meet the next generation
of law enforcement, Jackie.

167
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:27,726
Captain black,
they are ninjas.

168
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:32,097
My ninjas...Obeying
my every command.

169
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:37,602
Loyal, efficient, tireless.

170
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:40,438
Even as we speak,
they're out there,

171
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,275
cleansing
the streets of scum.

172
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:46,378
He-hey!
We got another one!

173
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,913
But I didn't
do anything!

174
00:10:48,915 --> 00:10:52,150
I'm telling you,
I'm innocent!

175
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:55,387
Yeah, yeah,
save the drama
for your mama.

176
00:10:55,389 --> 00:10:56,755
Good work, men!

177
00:10:56,757 --> 00:10:59,758
Uh, what did
all these people do?

178
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,727
It's what
they <i> didn't</i> do, Jackie.

179
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:04,529
I'm sorry?

180
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:06,898
(Softly)
They're not one of us.

181
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,833
(Softly)
- How can you be sure?

182
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:12,237
(Whispers)
The mask tells me.

183
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:15,440
It knows who's
naughty and nice.

184
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:19,177
It tells me
who to punish.

185
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:25,250
Where is uncle?

186
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,587
(Grunting)

187
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:37,829
Here is where we will
find more rare seaweed

188
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:40,265
for removal spell, tohru.

189
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:43,735
Oh, I hate fish.

190
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:52,944
(Thump)

191
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:55,447
Aiyaa!

192
00:11:56,716 --> 00:12:00,251
If the oni-mask keeps
"talking" to captain black,

193
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:02,353
who knows what
it will tell him next?

194
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:05,457
If we keep him inside
section 13 until
uncle gets back,

195
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:07,759
what's the worst
that could happen?

196
00:12:07,761 --> 00:12:10,962
(Gasps)
The other oni masks!

197
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:12,831
We have to snag
those face-huggers

198
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:15,300
before captain black
remembers they're
in the vault!

199
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:17,068
Jackie:
Easier said than done.

200
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:21,372
Section 13 is crawling
with his shadowkhan police.

201
00:12:21,374 --> 00:12:24,542
We must act like
nothing is wrong.

202
00:12:24,544 --> 00:12:27,412
Bad move, Jackie.

203
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,255
Gaah!

204
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,824
Where you off to, <i> buddy?</i>

205
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:45,163
Ha ha! Captain black!
Just out for a stroll.

206
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:48,933
Hmm. Like to...
The vault?

207
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,668
Uh, no.

208
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,737
Jackie, Jackie, Jackie.

209
00:12:52,739 --> 00:12:55,240
I thought
I could trust you.

210
00:12:55,242 --> 00:12:59,310
I thought
we were friends.

211
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:02,480
We are friends.
That is why
you must listen to me.

212
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:05,617
The mask is turning
you into one of
tarakudo's generals!

213
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:08,086
You must resist it!

214
00:13:08,088 --> 00:13:09,687
Nonsense.

215
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:12,524
The mask lets me
see things clearly.

216
00:13:12,526 --> 00:13:15,193
Like the fact that
you want to betray me.

217
00:13:15,195 --> 00:13:18,863
And since you're not
one of us, Jackie,

218
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:21,065
you can join the others.

219
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:23,101
Please! Listen to me!

220
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:24,769
Not to the mask!

221
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:26,271
(Electronic beeps)

222
00:13:26,273 --> 00:13:27,372
Hmm?

223
00:13:27,374 --> 00:13:30,208
Come on, come on! Unh!

224
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:32,010
(Grunts)

225
00:13:32,012 --> 00:13:37,448
Oh, Jade! don't go
and make captain black mad!

226
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:42,887
"Black." A fine name.
The color of darkness.

227
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:45,690
(Grunts) Denied!

228
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:47,158
(Growls) No!

229
00:13:55,701 --> 00:14:00,438
Duh, Jade, they're shadows.

230
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:06,911
You weren't planning
on stealing my masks,

231
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:08,746
now, were you, Jade?

232
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,252
You're getting kind
of greedy, aren't you,
captain black?

233
00:14:14,254 --> 00:14:16,287
You only have one face.

234
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:22,126
But 3 partners in darkness,
itching for a makeover.

235
00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:24,495
The captain black I know
would never do that!

236
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:30,001
The captain black you know
is on permanent vacation.

237
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:35,406
Well, he's about to catch
the next flight back!

238
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:38,710
Unh!

239
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:49,621
Ohh. Haven't been
feeling quite myself.

240
00:14:49,623 --> 00:14:52,624
Your other self isn't
quite yourself, either.

241
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,793
Whoa, Nelly!

242
00:14:55,795 --> 00:15:00,498
So you've gone and yanked
my yin from my Yang.

243
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:04,269
Feels like
a burden's been lifted.

244
00:15:04,271 --> 00:15:06,037
Now what?

245
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:07,305
Hello?!

246
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:12,944
(Crash)

247
00:15:12,946 --> 00:15:16,981
Hey! The power of
an ox in my pinkie!

248
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:19,784
Jackie's behind bars
and uncle's m.I.A.,

249
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:21,286
so it's up to us!

250
00:15:21,288 --> 00:15:24,322
Let's go kick my butt!

251
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:26,658
What's the matter,
chan?

252
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,293
don't you
like your room?

253
00:15:28,295 --> 00:15:33,932
Heh heh heh heh.
Maybe you should
complain to the management.

254
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:38,136
Boys, I come
bearing gifts.

255
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:39,871
No! Unh! Uhh! Uhh!

256
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:45,710
Put on a happy face.

257
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,446
Huh?
- Huh?
- Huh?

258
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:49,614
Rahr!

259
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,083
You've been jacked...

260
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:53,584
By the rabbit.

261
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:54,919
Catch her!

262
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:57,989
If you can!

263
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,226
Huh?

264
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:03,962
Uhh!

265
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:05,563
Rrr...

266
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:07,298
Facial!

267
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,368
Rrr...Rrr...

268
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,103
Tiger talisman?

269
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:14,939
Brought out
the best in me.

270
00:16:14,941 --> 00:16:16,074
Ohh.

271
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:17,742
They keys!

272
00:16:17,744 --> 00:16:19,143
(Grunting)

273
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:21,512
Rrr!

274
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:34,125
The bigger they are...

275
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:35,960
The slower they are.

276
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:47,171
Hyuh! Uhh!

277
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,473
Uhh!

278
00:16:48,475 --> 00:16:49,741
(Gulps)

279
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:52,443
Rrr...Uhh!

280
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:04,489
Ha ha ha!

281
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:07,291
I'm as strong
as any one of you bruisers.

282
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:16,667
Ooh!

283
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,338
Uhh!

284
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:30,181
Evil captain black:
Oh, captain black...

285
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:39,524
I don't think
section 13 is big enough
for the both of us.

286
00:17:39,526 --> 00:17:42,527
Then I'm afraid
I'll have to ask you
to leave.

287
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:52,003
Hurry, uncle.

288
00:17:52,005 --> 00:17:53,604
Quickly, tohru!

289
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:56,941
(Grunting)

290
00:17:56,943 --> 00:17:58,076
Eee!

291
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:02,647
Tohru: Aah!
- Uncle: Aiyaa!

292
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:11,923
Uhh!

293
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,595
Warning--
I may look small,

294
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:19,430
but I'm a giant
can of butt whoop

295
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:21,499
just waiting
to be opened.

296
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:38,349
Weakling.

297
00:18:38,351 --> 00:18:39,517
(Pow)

298
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:50,595
Ohh...

299
00:18:50,597 --> 00:18:54,432
I'm embarrassed
that we're even related.

300
00:18:54,434 --> 00:18:55,967
Ah, my masks.

301
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:00,338
Psst!

302
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:04,709
Jackie!

303
00:19:04,711 --> 00:19:08,379
I told you--do not
allow captain black

304
00:19:08,381 --> 00:19:10,815
to summon
shadowkhan!

305
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:15,319
Captain black doesn't
live here anymore, <i> old man.</i>

306
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,121
Guess again,
sparky.

307
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:28,166
Give up yet?

308
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:29,367
Uhh!

309
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:30,801
Thought so.

310
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,642
Look, I know we've been
at each other's throats,

311
00:19:37,644 --> 00:19:39,210
but...Friends?

312
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,321
No agents.

313
00:19:50,323 --> 00:19:52,523
Security here stinks.

314
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,192
Heh heh heh heh.

315
00:19:56,595 --> 00:20:00,298
Jade, you may
want to add this
to your collection.

316
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,700
It's good to have you
back, captain black.

317
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,802
It's good to be good.

318
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:06,537
Uncle: One more thing!

319
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:09,807
We must find phone booth
removal potion!

320
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:21,352
Hey, Jackie, have you ever had
a disagreement with a
good friend?

321
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:24,121
There's so many,
- so many times that happened.

322
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:25,356
Either one,
you have to call,

323
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:27,858
"hey, are you
angry about me?"

324
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,994
If I do something wrong,
I say, "sorry."

325
00:20:29,996 --> 00:20:33,631
Because very hard
to make a friend,
a good friend.

326
00:20:33,633 --> 00:20:37,401
When you have a good friend,
I would never let go.

327
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:40,905
Besides, parents important,
friends also important.

328
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:44,041
All those years,
I travelled so many places,

329
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:45,610
the friends helped me.

330
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:50,414
So friendship, friendship
is very, very important.
