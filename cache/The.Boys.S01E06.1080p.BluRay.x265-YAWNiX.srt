1
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,589
Obviously, a lot of it's temp.

2
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:47,548
I love it.

3
00:00:47,632 --> 00:00:50,718
If we're airing on TLC
between My 600-lb Life

4
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:53,262
and Little People, Big World.
But we're not.

5
00:00:53,346 --> 00:00:56,849
Because we're not cheap reality garbage.

6
00:00:56,933 --> 00:00:58,392
Sorry, Courtenay, I thought...

7
00:00:58,476 --> 00:01:01,062
I was trying to go for something
a bit more personable,

8
00:01:01,145 --> 00:01:02,980
- down-to-earth.
- Not this down-to-earth.

9
00:01:03,064 --> 00:01:05,942
I need them to look like
someone you'd want in the Army.

10
00:01:06,025 --> 00:01:11,364
We here are not fucking Heidi and Spencer.
We are the Seven, James.

11
00:01:11,447 --> 00:01:13,866
And why isn't there anything on Starlight?

12
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,119
She actually hasn't really made
herself available to the crew.

13
00:01:17,203 --> 00:01:18,663
Where the hell is she?

14
00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:21,082
Has a heavenly body lost her lustre?

15
00:01:21,165 --> 00:01:24,710
Two weeks after Starlight's shocking appearance
at the Believe Expo...

16
00:01:24,794 --> 00:01:28,506
Social media is still buzzing
about her controversial speech.

17
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:29,674
Was it a breakdown

18
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:31,425
- or a triumph?
- Of course,

19
00:01:31,509 --> 00:01:34,387
my thoughts are with Starlight,

20
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,347
and I support her in every way.

21
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,725
What I want to know, who's that dude
that stuck his **** in her face?

22
00:01:39,809 --> 00:01:41,852
She should **** that ****er in the ***hole.

23
00:01:42,645 --> 00:01:44,897
Okay.

24
00:01:44,981 --> 00:01:48,109
Of everything that I said,
that's what they focus on.

25
00:01:48,192 --> 00:01:50,319
Hey. Eye of the tiger.

26
00:01:50,403 --> 00:01:52,822
You and me, we have a Panera gift card to win.

27
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:56,242
- No distractions. Come on.
- Good one here.

28
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:58,077
Before joining the Seven,

29
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,705
which hero led a search-and-rescue team...

30
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:04,166
- Oh, my God.
- After the 1994 Northridge earthquake?

31
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,336
Isn't it your job to know this kind of stuff?

32
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,463
- It's Lamplighter.
- Thank you.

33
00:02:09,547 --> 00:02:12,091
- Yeah, I had all the trading cards.
- Of course you did.

34
00:02:13,551 --> 00:02:14,468
Hughie?

35
00:02:16,262 --> 00:02:18,347
- Hey.
- Where the hell have you been?

36
00:02:18,431 --> 00:02:21,517
After Gary's store, we all thought that...

37
00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:25,479
Hi. Anthony.

38
00:02:25,563 --> 00:02:27,523
Hughie's best-looking friend since 4th grade.

39
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:30,693
Hi, I'm Annie. It's nice to meet you.

40
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:32,069
You look familiar.

41
00:02:32,153 --> 00:02:35,281
- Did you go to Kennedy?
- She's new in town.

42
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:38,284
Fantastic. So, what are we drinking,
New-to-Town Annie?

43
00:02:40,453 --> 00:02:42,580
So, Gretchen Scaramucci...

44
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:46,250
- No, no.
- She was bigger than all the guys.

45
00:02:46,334 --> 00:02:48,627
Like André the Giant-big.
So when Gretchen says

46
00:02:48,711 --> 00:02:52,381
she wants to beat
the living fuck out of this guy

47
00:02:52,465 --> 00:02:54,467
for making a crack about her girlfriend...

48
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,177
- Oh, you didn't.
- Hughie gives her

49
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:59,221
this Clint Eastwood stare, like...

50
00:02:59,305 --> 00:03:03,768
And then, bam, runs, like Forrest Gump-runs,

51
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:06,270
five blocks down into a pet store

52
00:03:06,354 --> 00:03:08,814
where he hides behind this jumbo bag

53
00:03:08,898 --> 00:03:13,569
of Kibbles 'n Bits for four hours.

54
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:14,612
I'll be right back.

55
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:19,033
I know it! I know this!

56
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:22,036
- Surprised to run into you here, man.
- Yeah. Same goes for you.

57
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:23,954
I've been worried, asshole.

58
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:26,540
Ever since Robin, you...

59
00:03:26,624 --> 00:03:28,667
You weren't answering your phone.

60
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:31,003
Like, for all I knew, you were chugging Drano.

61
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:34,965
- I'm sorry, man.
- Yeah, you should be.

62
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:38,427
- No, really, I should've called.
- You think?

63
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:42,890
I'm okay. Really. I just...

64
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:45,142
needed a fresh start.

65
00:03:45,226 --> 00:03:46,977
Fresh start?

66
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:54,402
Your fresh start is way out of your league.

67
00:03:54,485 --> 00:03:58,364
- You know that, right?
- I am aware, yes.

68
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:00,241
Annie's great, man.

69
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:01,867
Live your life.

70
00:04:01,951 --> 00:04:03,994
That's what Robin would want.

71
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,878
Sync mark.

72
00:04:12,962 --> 00:04:14,004
We're good.

73
00:04:14,088 --> 00:04:16,841
- You rolling?
- And... action.

74
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:19,885
My grandfather built this place
with his bare hands.

75
00:04:19,969 --> 00:04:21,303
He was an amazing man.

76
00:04:21,387 --> 00:04:23,639
Oh, the old piano.

77
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:27,059
Every night, Mom would sit here
and she would play some songs and...

78
00:04:27,143 --> 00:04:29,728
I got to be honest, most of the time,
me and my dad would be...

79
00:04:29,812 --> 00:04:31,564
We'd be making model planes.

80
00:04:31,647 --> 00:04:34,984
I can almost smell the... silver paint.

81
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:41,282
I really wish he'd lived long enough
to see me fly with the Blue Angels.

82
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:43,242
That would have blown his mind.

83
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:45,578
That's me in the middle.

84
00:04:47,455 --> 00:04:49,957
Love you, Mom, Dad.

85
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,461
Welcome to my bedroom.
The Baseball Hall of Fame, you might call it.

86
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:54,837
Hasn't changed a bit.

87
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,755
Oh, there they are, the Tigers.

88
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:58,466
It's my little team.

89
00:04:58,549 --> 00:04:59,925
I played shortstop. Of course,

90
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:02,595
I couldn't show everything I had.

91
00:05:02,678 --> 00:05:04,430
But... let's just say we...

92
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:06,557
We did a lot of winning.

93
00:05:07,725 --> 00:05:10,060
This is just...

94
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:16,400
Really just...
It's so special to come back.

95
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:23,657
- I'm sorry, why is that there?
- Sorry?

96
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:26,202
Who put the fucking blanket on the bed?

97
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:28,204
- Randy Set-Dec, I think.
- Who's Randy Set-Dec?

98
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:29,371
He's over there.

99
00:05:29,455 --> 00:05:32,374
Randy, why? You fucking asshole.

100
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,710
Amateur fuck.

101
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:35,753
What just happened?

102
00:05:41,717 --> 00:05:43,469
Samaritan's Embrace,

103
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:46,764
led by Ezekiel but bankrolled by Vought,

104
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:51,185
has been shipping Compound V
to 53 hospitals across the country

105
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:54,313
since 1971 and gift wrapping it...

106
00:05:57,983 --> 00:05:59,443
Gift wrapping it

107
00:05:59,527 --> 00:06:01,195
- as polio vaccine.
- Are you telling me

108
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:04,657
God's not reaching up the twats
of American girls and blessing babies?

109
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,909
Butcher, can you leave God out of this?

110
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:09,703
Hold on, hold on. So, no hero was born?

111
00:06:09,787 --> 00:06:13,832
None of them? They're all just kids
dosed with the blue shit.

112
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,793
- I mean, even...
- Even fucking Starlight.

113
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:23,634
Do you think they know...

114
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,261
what really happened to them?

115
00:06:26,512 --> 00:06:27,846
What about Homelander?

116
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:31,183
Homelander's a black hole.
Never had any public records and never will.

117
00:06:31,267 --> 00:06:33,060
However, every single other Supe?

118
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:34,770
Juiced-up lab rats.

119
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:37,356
My God. I'm trying to give

120
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:40,901
a tremendous fucking TED Talk here,
and this...

121
00:06:40,985 --> 00:06:44,530
- Frenchie, can you control her, please?
- I do not control her.

122
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:49,410
- Do you see what I'm dealing with?
- Well, spot on, M.M.

123
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:52,288
We got Vought for child endangerment,
drug trafficking,

124
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:56,125
and possibly the largest fraud
in American fucking history.

125
00:06:57,293 --> 00:06:59,295
Raynor's gonna love it.

126
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:01,171
You better hope she does.

127
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:06,594
Hi.

128
00:07:11,307 --> 00:07:12,808
Hughie, no!

129
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:14,184
No, no, no.

130
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:15,978
Not if you're attached to that hand, no.

131
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:20,107
It's okay. Yeah.

132
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:23,235
Well, you know, all of this, it's...

133
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:25,821
But it's only part of the story, no?

134
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:29,325
I mean, what about
our petite Lazarus here?

135
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:30,701
She's not an infant.

136
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:34,288
And she was injected in a basement,
not a hospital.

137
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:36,957
And there is the small matter
of that she rose from the dead.

138
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:39,501
Well, your feral pixie dream girl
ain't exactly dictating

139
00:07:39,585 --> 00:07:41,211
her fucking memoirs, is she, Frenchie?

140
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:43,964
I'm feeling she's trying to communicate.

141
00:07:44,048 --> 00:07:46,508
I mean, she's been doing this for...

142
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:47,968
Maybe that means something, huh?

143
00:07:48,052 --> 00:07:50,137
- Maybe they're chicken scratches.
- Let's find out.

144
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,973
Nah, you've been burned.
It's not safe out there for you.

145
00:07:53,057 --> 00:07:55,100
M.M.'s right. You got to fucking stay put, son.

146
00:07:58,562 --> 00:08:00,481
- All right, I'm off.
- Okay.

147
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:04,318
I'll just keep on Starlight then, right?

148
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,364
Her phone's been tits-up for a week.

149
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,866
You wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

150
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:14,244
No.

151
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:16,622
But I can... I can check.

152
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:22,753
All right.

153
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,296
You're with me.

154
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,048
- He is?
- I am?

155
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:28,384
What, to the CIA lady?

156
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:31,261
No. We're gonna go on a little detour.

157
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:33,597
You'll love it.

158
00:08:33,681 --> 00:08:34,932
Come on.

159
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,727
No, I have been working with her!

160
00:08:38,811 --> 00:08:41,271
I've been fucking working with her!
I can't believe this.

161
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:45,859
Who the fuck are you gonna get to replace me?
I'd like to see what bitch that is!

162
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:48,445
You okay?

163
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:55,828
You know that pledge
you mentor during rush week

164
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:58,372
because she seems sweet and a little naive

165
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:01,291
and she doesn't know
she's not supposed to wear UGGs?

166
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:04,420
And then once she's active,
she stabs you in the back,

167
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:06,004
gets you kicked out of the house?

168
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:09,466
I'm sorry. I don't...

169
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:13,303
It was my big idea to book you
for the Believe Expo.

170
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:15,139
What could go wrong, I thought.

171
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:18,142
You were playing to your base.

172
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:22,604
At least I don't have to kiss your ass anymore.

173
00:09:27,735 --> 00:09:29,194
Come in.

174
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:32,322
Thank you for coming, Starlight.

175
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:34,491
You fired Ashley?

176
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:36,660
It was actually a mutual decision.

177
00:09:36,744 --> 00:09:39,121
She wanted to explore different career paths,

178
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:41,123
and we wished her well.

179
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:43,584
So, I would like you to take this

180
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:47,629
in the constructive spirit that it is intended.

181
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:49,465
Okay.

182
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:52,718
You are a selfish, arrogant child.

183
00:09:54,762 --> 00:09:55,804
Back in Iowa,

184
00:09:55,888 --> 00:09:58,390
I bet you watched a lot
of Queen Maeve's movies, right?

185
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,185
I did.

186
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:03,020
She was a rebel.

187
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,397
Didn't take anyone's shit,
didn't play by the rules.

188
00:10:05,481 --> 00:10:09,443
That's what you wanted to be.
That's what American heroes are.

189
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:11,069
But it's a myth.

190
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:13,989
I should know, because I wrote it.

191
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:18,452
The truth is,
dozens of people in this company

192
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:24,249
spent hundreds of hours
to create the thing that is you.

193
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:25,918
I never asked for that.

194
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:31,256
Then why don't you burn the sparkly outfit
and become a cop?

195
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:35,302
You want to be a superhero.

196
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,137
You want to be famous.

197
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,641
But nobody's famous alone.

198
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:45,771
So, why don't you cut the petulant diva shit,

199
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:47,648
show a little fucking gratitude,

200
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:49,233
and let us do our job?

201
00:10:56,073 --> 00:10:57,282
No.

202
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,035
I'm sorry.

203
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:02,621
I mean, I don't mean to be ungrateful.

204
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:06,124
But... no red carpets,

205
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,168
no reality TV,

206
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:10,337
and no Noxzema commercials.

207
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,965
And I want my old uniform back.

208
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:15,801
I'm gonna save people.

209
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:21,014
Then I think we may need to reconsider
your position in the Seven.

210
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:28,730
And I think that firing an employee
after she reported sexual assault on live TV

211
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:30,274
might tank your stock price.

212
00:11:32,568 --> 00:11:35,362
Well, I hope
we can count on your discretion.

213
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:38,991
I'm sorry, I don't do discretion anymore.

214
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:42,327
If anyone asks me who did it,
I'm gonna answer honestly.

215
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:45,330
Well, I think it's great
that you want to tell the truth.

216
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:47,291
I just don't know to whom you're referring.

217
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:49,334
Oh, I think you know.

218
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:53,547
I think you've known for a long time.

219
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:58,927
Thank you so much for coming, Starlight.

220
00:11:59,011 --> 00:12:00,512
I have a lot to think about.

221
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:17,487
Okay.

222
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:19,489
I mean, you take
Tek Knight's Knightracer?

223
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:22,200
Had a carbon footprint the size of a 727.

224
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:24,328
The thing literally shot fire.

225
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:26,246
Thanks to me, now he drives a hybrid.

226
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:28,624
That's what the Green Crusader
initiative is all about.

227
00:12:28,707 --> 00:12:33,003
To respect what's beautiful in the world.

228
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:37,090
- What's up?
- Hi.

229
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:43,180
So... everything.

230
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:44,848
So beautiful.

231
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:48,060
Good. Let's reset.
Trash back on the beach, please.

232
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:50,062
Background, put the trash back
on the beach.

233
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:52,606
All right.

234
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:56,485
Well, we lost my dad at a young age,
and my mom, she worked two jobs,

235
00:12:56,568 --> 00:13:00,906
so, it was my older brother, Nathan,
who pretty much raised me up.

236
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:04,826
And when I was 3, these guys started shooting
in front of my building

237
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,495
and I outran the damn bullet.

238
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:08,080
That's kind of how I figured out...

239
00:13:08,163 --> 00:13:10,040
Can I stop you right there for a second?

240
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,584
What if we ixnay the gun violence?

241
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:14,962
Maybe make it a click more upbeat?

242
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:18,090
Yeah, yeah.

243
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:20,425
All right, little bro,
I know you're the fastest man

244
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:22,678
in the world and all that,
but your work ain't done.

245
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:24,888
Set. Go.

246
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,685
Nope. You're off, bro.

247
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:31,061
Go again.

248
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:33,230
Go.

249
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:34,398
Nope. Go.

250
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,149
No.

251
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:37,693
No?

252
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:39,861
What is going on with you, man?

253
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:45,617
Here comes the A-Train!

254
00:13:45,701 --> 00:13:48,787
Hey, you knew Popclaw, right?

255
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,580
What? I don't...

256
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:52,624
You guys were in Teenage Kix together?

257
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:55,168
You heard she passed away, yeah?

258
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:57,629
Yeah, they're saying it was a stroke,

259
00:13:57,713 --> 00:14:00,090
but between you and me,

260
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:02,009
I think it was probably a drug overdose.

261
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:06,513
You want to maybe say
a little something in her honour?

262
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:13,270
I haven't seen her in years, so, you know...

263
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:30,871
Boy, you're really milking this thing
for all it's worth.

264
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:34,291
- Excuse me?
- This empowerment act.

265
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,585
I mean, every time I'm on a red carpet now,

266
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:40,088
they're asking me
how I'm supporting Starlight.

267
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,925
But, hey, as long as you're trending, right?

268
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:45,802
I know that you might not get this,

269
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:48,388
but it's not an act.

270
00:14:48,472 --> 00:14:50,015
I'm just trying to be honest.

271
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:52,684
Okay. Yeah.

272
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:57,439
When I was younger,

273
00:14:57,522 --> 00:15:02,069
I read your autobiography
so many times that I wore it out.

274
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:04,279
I had to buy a second one.

275
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:08,241
I wanted to live my life exactly like yours.

276
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:11,870
Because you didn't just break all the bones
in your right arm

277
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:14,998
stopping that school bus
from falling off of a bridge,

278
00:15:15,082 --> 00:15:19,711
but you also went to every kid's
physical therapy afterwards.

279
00:15:19,795 --> 00:15:22,589
Just to show the world
that they were heroes, too.

280
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,717
You really stood for something.

281
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:28,887
But now...

282
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:33,642
I'm pretty sure that was just written
by the marketing guys.

283
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,899
...hunting for his own food.

284
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:44,444
When fully mature, this immense
predator of the sea

285
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:47,906
can reach sizes of up to 25 feet in length

286
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:49,825
and over 4,000 pounds.

287
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:54,329
They can reach speeds
of up to 35 miles per hour...

288
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:56,123
Mon coeur...

289
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:00,961
would you like me to change it?

290
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:10,971
You talked to me.

291
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:12,889
- She talked to me.
- That's talking?

292
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:14,474
Well, she communicated anyway.

293
00:16:14,558 --> 00:16:16,643
- She likes Shark Week, huh?
- I'll call BuzzFeed.

294
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:19,437
I wonder if she lived by the water.

295
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:27,571
You know, you can't fool me.

296
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:32,117
Who is she? What does she want?
Why is she here?

297
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,910
She could be the key to it all.

298
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:36,997
- That's what you think, huh?
- No, that's not what I think.

299
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,624
Yes, you do. It torments you. It's okay.

300
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,626
Listen, I got one word for you.

301
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,920
It's a sure-fire way to solve this puzzle.

302
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:46,089
Once and for all.

303
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:47,340
Tell me.

304
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:48,550
Mesmer.

305
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:50,510
Mesmer?

306
00:16:50,594 --> 00:16:52,387
You want help from a Supe?

307
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:56,099
He despise Vought, hates them,
hates the other Supes.

308
00:16:56,183 --> 00:16:57,726
And the enemy of your enemy...

309
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:01,062
Frenchie, what part of "you're burned"
do you not understand?

310
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:02,772
Oh, come on. It's a quick trip.

311
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:04,441
She and I will hide in the van.

312
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:05,901
Let's go. In, out, boom, bing.

313
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:08,820
Boom, bing? Look, I'll tell you what I can do.

314
00:17:08,904 --> 00:17:12,157
I can... possibly...

315
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:14,826
tattoo "fuck no" on your ass.

316
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:15,869
Come on.

317
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:17,829
Best I can do.

318
00:17:17,913 --> 00:17:19,331
You know...

319
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,001
I've seen you eat ice cream.

320
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:25,045
- Oh, my God.
- Chunky Monkey, I believe.

321
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:26,755
- Where is this going?
- Well, you know,

322
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:28,757
you take a spoonful, a chunk of fudge.

323
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,051
But then I see you
with the surface is uneven.

324
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:32,886
So what do you do?
You take another scoop,

325
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:36,723
you try to even it out, which, tragically,
creates a corresponding divot.

326
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:39,559
Ultimately, there is only
but one choice for you, no?

327
00:17:39,643 --> 00:17:41,353
To consume the entire pint.

328
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:43,647
No, you don't want to,
you don't want to.

329
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:44,898
But you must.

330
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:46,483
And I tell you why, my friend,

331
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:49,778
because you cannot bear things
out of order.

332
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:54,324
And she...

333
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:57,577
She's out of order.

334
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:04,209
All right. You want to tell me
where we're going?

335
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:08,296
You don't do it anymore.

336
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,590
- What?
- You know that feeling you get

337
00:18:10,674 --> 00:18:12,968
when you tip your chair back too far,

338
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:15,679
and you catch yourself
just before you fall?

339
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:16,596
Yeah?

340
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,182
You used to look like that all day long.

341
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:20,684
But now look at you,

342
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:24,187
neck-deep in shit, cool as a cucumber.

343
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:28,400
You ain't half the twat
I thought you were, Hughie.

344
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:32,779
You know, you're always calling
people "cunts" or "twats."

345
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:35,031
But I never really got how that's an insult.

346
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:37,659
They're flexible, take a pounding,

347
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:41,788
and they're the reason behind, like,
98 percent of my life decisions.

348
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:43,873
You're doing good, Hughie.

349
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:46,084
And you're a good cunt.

350
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:51,840
Well, here we are.

351
00:18:51,923 --> 00:18:52,757
Church?

352
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:57,304
Seek and ye shall find, my son.

353
00:18:58,555 --> 00:18:59,556
Come on.

354
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:05,979
Some days are harder than others, obviously.

355
00:19:09,232 --> 00:19:14,279
You know, the other day, I wanted to talk
to my friend about all this, but I couldn't.

356
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:16,364
That's why this group is so great.

357
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:17,824
It's so important.

358
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:21,453
I know it's wrong to feel angry.

359
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:25,373
After all, Tek Knight saved me.

360
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:30,378
I just wish he'd been a little more gentle
with my spine.

361
00:19:31,421 --> 00:19:34,257
It's about acceptance, isn't it?

362
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:36,509
Letting go. Moving on.

363
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:41,973
Seth, you're up.

364
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:50,982
- Hey. Hey, everybody.
- Hey, Seth.

365
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:53,276
So I'm kind of a writer.

366
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,569
I work in marketing.

367
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:57,447
There's this one hero,
who shall remain nameless,

368
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,907
but has ice powers.

369
00:20:00,575 --> 00:20:02,660
Ice Princess.

370
00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:05,413
I'm not allowed to say.

371
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:08,750
Anyway, she took a liking to me.

372
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,835
It was heady, man.

373
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:13,004
Intoxicating.

374
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:15,215
No one wants to fuck the writer.

375
00:20:16,508 --> 00:20:19,427
Needless to say, I fell for her, bigtime.

376
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:21,971
What kind of nobber falls for a Supe?

377
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:26,309
Anyway, we were, you know, being intimate,

378
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:30,563
when she climaxed
and accidentally turned into ice.

379
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:32,399
Just for a second,

380
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:34,818
but I was...

381
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:38,530
still in there,

382
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:41,282
at negative 346 degrees.

383
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:44,494
Same temperature as liquid nitrogen.

384
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:47,205
As you can imagine...

385
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,126
it snapped off.

386
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:57,590
The crazy thing is, I still miss her.

387
00:20:57,674 --> 00:21:02,053
It's like, that's the cost of a mortal like me

388
00:21:02,137 --> 00:21:05,098
for being with a god like her.

389
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:07,892
If a Supe done that
when she was happy,

390
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:09,894
imagine what one would do if she found out

391
00:21:09,978 --> 00:21:11,771
you'd been lying to her from the get-go?

392
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:14,482
Excuse me.

393
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:19,487
- You have something you'd like to share?
- No, no. Apologies.

394
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:23,032
Please do continue the Ice Capades.

395
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:26,453
We don't make jokes or judgements here.

396
00:21:26,536 --> 00:21:29,789
Why don't you take the talking stick
and tell us your story?

397
00:21:30,832 --> 00:21:32,667
Nah, I'm good.

398
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,878
You know, I've seen guys like you before.

399
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:36,171
Oh, I seriously doubt that.

400
00:21:36,254 --> 00:21:39,883
The smirk, the jokes,
it's all a defence mechanism.

401
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:43,928
But you don't have to do that here.
This is a safe space.

402
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:48,600
I said I'm good. Time to move on.

403
00:21:49,851 --> 00:21:52,061
Go ahead, Seth. Give him the stick.

404
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:58,902
You, back off, or I'll shove this stick
where your dick used to be.

405
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:03,740
You're a bunch of pathetic
Supe-worshipping cunts.

406
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:07,535
I bet you'd thank a Supe if they shat
on your mom's best china.

407
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:11,331
Did it ever occur to you
that they split your spine

408
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:14,459
or broke your dick just for a laugh?

409
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:18,463
Where's your fucking rage?

410
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:20,882
Your self-respect?

411
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:24,969
Sitting here in your little share circle.

412
00:22:25,887 --> 00:22:28,389
Having a little whinge and a moan.

413
00:22:28,473 --> 00:22:29,891
Fuck "letting go."

414
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:32,143
You should be out there
with a fucking chain saw,

415
00:22:32,227 --> 00:22:33,228
going after them!

416
00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:38,274
Just a bunch of scared
fucking rabbits.

417
00:22:40,151 --> 00:22:41,528
Supes are all the same.

418
00:22:41,611 --> 00:22:43,196
Every fucking one of them.

419
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:49,619
He's...

420
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:52,038
Sorry.

421
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:01,047
Oh, Ms Stillwell, hey,
you wanted to see me, right?

422
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,591
- Yeah, I'm running late. Can you walk with me?
- Yeah, sure.

423
00:23:03,675 --> 00:23:06,928
Hey, look, I brought a little present
for your little guy.

424
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:10,098
Never too young to start saving the world, right?

425
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:13,017
I'm gonna need you to make a public apology.

426
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:15,853
And you're going to be taking
a sabbatical from the Seven.

427
00:23:15,937 --> 00:23:18,314
- What?
- We are going to be stationing you

428
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:20,441
in Sandusky, Ohio for a while.

429
00:23:20,525 --> 00:23:25,863
Okay, okay, look, I know my brain wasn't
in the right place, but my heart was.

430
00:23:25,947 --> 00:23:27,574
And it's just that damn Oceanland.

431
00:23:27,657 --> 00:23:29,659
- They wouldn't...
- This is not about the dolphin.

432
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:31,494
This is about Starlight.

433
00:23:31,578 --> 00:23:33,955
Starlight? What are you...?
What about Starlight?

434
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:37,166
Everybody seems to want to know
who she was referencing in that speech,

435
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,127
and it is not going away.

436
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:42,589
It's only a matter of time
before she, or, let's be honest,

437
00:23:42,672 --> 00:23:44,799
some of the other women, speak up.

438
00:23:44,882 --> 00:23:47,552
- So we need to get ahead of it.
- Okay.

439
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:50,221
There may have been
a misunderstanding, I know that,

440
00:23:50,305 --> 00:23:52,223
but can't you just...

441
00:23:52,307 --> 00:23:55,393
you know, handle it? Like you do?

442
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:58,938
This is the way we are handling things now.

443
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:05,528
I'm in full support of women

444
00:24:05,612 --> 00:24:08,489
and their ongoing bravery in speaking out.

445
00:24:11,868 --> 00:24:13,328
I'm sorry. Let me start that over.

446
00:24:13,411 --> 00:24:15,830
I'm in full support of women
and their ongoing bravery...

447
00:24:16,998 --> 00:24:19,626
Fuck, I'm sorry.
Yeah, let's just cut. I'm sorry.

448
00:24:19,709 --> 00:24:21,044
Scene take two. Alpha mark.

449
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:24,255
Starlight, I hope you can forgive me.

450
00:24:24,339 --> 00:24:26,424
- Harder to sell.
- To sell it. Yeah.

451
00:24:26,507 --> 00:24:27,842
- A little harder.
- Perfect.

452
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:30,553
Speaking out.
We can all become stronger...

453
00:24:30,637 --> 00:24:32,180
by listening. Okay.

454
00:24:33,765 --> 00:24:38,144
I realise that my behaviour has caused Starlight
a great deal of pain,

455
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:41,939
and I sincerely apologise for this.

456
00:24:42,023 --> 00:24:44,942
Though at the time I believed
that our encounter was consensual,

457
00:24:45,026 --> 00:24:47,987
I now realise that I misread the moment...

458
00:24:48,071 --> 00:24:50,239
Our new movie, Insurrection,
it's really exciting.

459
00:24:50,323 --> 00:24:52,075
It's my first movie with the...

460
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:55,203
in the Vought Cinematic Universe, the VCU.

461
00:24:55,328 --> 00:25:00,083
New York. The hearts of 7 million men and women
beat inside this city.

462
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:03,044
But there's only one person
who can see inside their hearts

463
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:05,463
and read their minds.

464
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:06,964
This man is the rapist.

465
00:25:12,053 --> 00:25:14,263
There are no secrets from me.

466
00:25:14,287 --> 00:25:16,287
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

467
00:25:47,505 --> 00:25:49,882
Thank you so much.
Thank you. Thank you.

468
00:25:49,966 --> 00:25:51,843
Okay. "There are no secrets from me."

469
00:25:51,926 --> 00:25:54,595
- There are no secrets from me.
- There are no secrets from me.

470
00:25:55,596 --> 00:25:56,931
Hey.

471
00:25:58,099 --> 00:25:59,976
What number am I thinking of?

472
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:03,438
Eight sixty-seven?

473
00:26:03,521 --> 00:26:04,814
Fucking amazing.

474
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:07,900
This guy's fucking amazing.

475
00:26:07,984 --> 00:26:10,153
So, what am I thinking of?

476
00:26:12,822 --> 00:26:14,824
I'm thinking the same thing.

477
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:16,534
Cool.

478
00:26:16,617 --> 00:26:19,579
- Now, why don't I put this down?
- Okay.

479
00:26:19,662 --> 00:26:21,038
- Yeah. Okay.
- Cool.

480
00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:23,040
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

481
00:26:23,124 --> 00:26:25,209
- Mr Mesmer.
- Just Mesmer.

482
00:26:25,293 --> 00:26:26,836
No "mister" necessary.

483
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:28,963
- You know, I'm a big fan, man.
- Thanks.

484
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:31,132
- Weren't you in Teenage Kix with A-Train?
- Yep.

485
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:33,259
Yeah. Yo, A-Train's really blown up, hasn't he?

486
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:36,053
- He's doing his thing.
- Yeah, I'm really happy for him.

487
00:26:36,137 --> 00:26:38,473
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

488
00:26:38,556 --> 00:26:40,183
You a fan of the show?

489
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:42,101
Oh, nah, man. I've never seen it.

490
00:26:42,185 --> 00:26:44,812
- Okay.
- You know what I'm a fan of?

491
00:26:44,896 --> 00:26:46,314
Your insider trading.

492
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:51,152
The way you brushed your hand
up against that Wall Street guy?

493
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:53,905
Brother, that shit right there,
now, that was ruthless.

494
00:26:53,988 --> 00:26:56,240
Vought dropped you
like a hot potato afterwards,

495
00:26:56,324 --> 00:26:58,701
which I think is some bullshit,
but with the SEC coming...

496
00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:00,244
Who the fuck are you?

497
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,499
Why don't you take a peep and see?

498
00:27:12,215 --> 00:27:13,966
How do you know about Cleo?

499
00:27:15,676 --> 00:27:18,221
There are no secrets from me.

500
00:27:18,304 --> 00:27:20,848
Well, I work for Child Services.

501
00:27:20,932 --> 00:27:24,227
My colleague Tina, she owes me a favour.

502
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:27,814
See, she, just like I,
believe in second chances.

503
00:27:27,897 --> 00:27:29,524
Cut the shit.

504
00:27:29,607 --> 00:27:31,234
I lost custody three years ago.

505
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:34,612
Nobody believes in second chances
for fuck-ups like me.

506
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:44,705
She's waiting on you.

507
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:50,253
Tina. Hey.

508
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:52,255
- Hi.
- It's good to see you.

509
00:27:52,338 --> 00:27:54,298
Good to see you, too.

510
00:27:54,382 --> 00:27:57,093
Five minutes. Next time you owe me.

511
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:58,845
I do.

512
00:27:58,928 --> 00:28:00,221
Hey, Cleo.

513
00:28:03,766 --> 00:28:05,560
You remember your old man?

514
00:28:05,643 --> 00:28:07,186
Hi, Charles.

515
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:21,033
I'm sorry that...

516
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:28,958
I'm gonna try and be
in your life a little bit more.

517
00:28:30,418 --> 00:28:31,752
Would that be okay?

518
00:28:31,836 --> 00:28:33,004
I guess.

519
00:28:34,338 --> 00:28:36,465
Okay, Cleo.

520
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:38,551
We got to get back.

521
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:41,304
- Bye.
- Hey...

522
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:50,938
I just...

523
00:28:51,022 --> 00:28:52,648
I just want to know you don't hate me.

524
00:28:54,317 --> 00:28:56,611
I don't really know you.

525
00:29:02,783 --> 00:29:05,244
Hey, wait...

526
00:29:09,165 --> 00:29:11,292
So you can know me a little better.

527
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:13,878
I don't have a DVD player.

528
00:29:15,963 --> 00:29:17,465
Bye.

529
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:20,927
Thanks again. I'll call you next week.

530
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:22,845
Okay. You all right?

531
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,186
I can see her every month?

532
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:34,190
One hour, supervised. You clean?

533
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:36,192
- I can be.
- Good.

534
00:29:37,318 --> 00:29:39,195
Who do you want me to read?

535
00:29:41,489 --> 00:29:43,324
What are we doing here?

536
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:52,583
My wife, Becca, used to hum the Spice Girls.

537
00:29:52,667 --> 00:29:55,962
Drove me round the fucking bend,
you know.

538
00:29:56,045 --> 00:29:57,463
All day long,

539
00:29:57,546 --> 00:30:00,174
walking around the house, humming.

540
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:01,884
She was happy.

541
00:30:03,469 --> 00:30:06,847
Now, fuck know why she was happy with me...

542
00:30:06,931 --> 00:30:09,016
but she was happy.

543
00:30:25,616 --> 00:30:27,994
Homelander raped her.

544
00:30:35,251 --> 00:30:36,961
Jesus.

545
00:30:42,842 --> 00:30:44,552
I'm sorry.

546
00:30:54,145 --> 00:30:57,314
Not long after that,
she came and sat right here.

547
00:31:00,026 --> 00:31:03,362
I know this because she got tagged
in that security camera right there.

548
00:31:10,036 --> 00:31:12,413
She sat here for three hours.

549
00:31:14,457 --> 00:31:16,751
Didn't move a muscle.

550
00:31:21,297 --> 00:31:24,550
Then she just got up and walked away.

551
00:31:30,598 --> 00:31:32,808
That was eight years ago.

552
00:31:34,518 --> 00:31:36,228
And nobody's seen her since.

553
00:31:40,107 --> 00:31:42,568
Either Homelander killed her

554
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:45,696
or she killed herself. Same difference.

555
00:31:52,036 --> 00:31:53,829
You see,

556
00:31:53,913 --> 00:31:56,540
I know what it's like to lose someone.

557
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:03,589
You and me, we're in this together.

558
00:32:06,592 --> 00:32:07,927
For Robin...

559
00:32:08,969 --> 00:32:10,846
and Becca.

560
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:18,854
That is why you can't allow yourself

561
00:32:18,938 --> 00:32:21,774
to be distracted by another bird.

562
00:32:23,984 --> 00:32:26,320
Especially not a Supe.

563
00:32:36,831 --> 00:32:38,624
Just remember...

564
00:32:41,252 --> 00:32:43,129
who your friends

565
00:32:44,171 --> 00:32:46,382
and who your enemies are.

566
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:15,953
That is gonna kill somebody
when it lands in Boston.

567
00:33:19,248 --> 00:33:21,792
Look, I heard what happened.

568
00:33:23,377 --> 00:33:25,921
I am so, so sorry.

569
00:33:27,131 --> 00:33:29,133
What kind of place did you grow up in?

570
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:31,093
Well, I moved around a lot,

571
00:33:31,177 --> 00:33:33,262
so, it was a bunch of condos.

572
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:36,557
So, what if I took you to a house

573
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:41,979
you'd never seen before, full of photos
of parents you never met,

574
00:33:42,062 --> 00:33:44,607
toys you never played with,

575
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:47,902
Hardy Boy books that you never read?

576
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:51,864
And then I asked you

577
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:55,701
how much all that fake
fucking bullshit meant to you?

578
00:33:57,578 --> 00:34:00,372
How would that make you feel?

579
00:34:00,456 --> 00:34:02,291
I wouldn't like that.

580
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:10,341
I'm really sorry about the blanket.

581
00:34:10,424 --> 00:34:12,468
It never should have been there,

582
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:14,511
and Randy Set-Dec
has already been terminated.

583
00:34:17,014 --> 00:34:18,766
But right now...

584
00:34:20,601 --> 00:34:23,687
we need to finish that tour

585
00:34:25,064 --> 00:34:28,901
and to show how down-to-earth
and ready to serve you are.

586
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:32,780
And I need you to tell the mother story.

587
00:34:32,863 --> 00:34:34,031
Please.

588
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,789
Please do it for me.

589
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:47,503
It was actually my mom who dragged me along

590
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:50,047
to my first Little League practise,

591
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:52,299
and pretty soon after that,
I just loved the game

592
00:34:52,383 --> 00:34:54,635
more than anything else in the world.

593
00:34:54,718 --> 00:34:58,597
So every year
she would bake me a birthday cake

594
00:34:58,681 --> 00:35:00,432
in the shape of a baseball diamond.

595
00:35:00,516 --> 00:35:05,771
And... I got to tell you, it was perfect.

596
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:06,772
Perfect.

597
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:10,693
Everything, down to the last minute details.

598
00:35:12,695 --> 00:35:14,571
Just like her.

599
00:35:16,532 --> 00:35:19,576
Cut. Perfect. So great.

600
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:21,537
- So we're done?
- Yes.

601
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,038
Great.

602
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:38,846
So...

603
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:42,349
- she can't talk or won't talk?
- That's what you're gonna tell us.

604
00:35:42,433 --> 00:35:44,143
Anything in particular you want to know?

605
00:35:44,226 --> 00:35:46,895
- Everything there is to know.
- Well, that narrows it down.

606
00:35:46,979 --> 00:35:48,355
Mon coeur...

607
00:35:48,439 --> 00:35:50,316
will you come?

608
00:35:50,399 --> 00:35:51,942
Have a seat.

609
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,947
It's okay. Have a seat.

610
00:36:05,581 --> 00:36:06,665
Gentle.

611
00:36:06,749 --> 00:36:08,042
Yeah.

612
00:36:33,984 --> 00:36:35,319
- Jesus fucking...
- Goddamn it.

613
00:36:35,402 --> 00:36:37,279
- Relax!
- No.

614
00:36:37,363 --> 00:36:38,489
Everyone relax!

615
00:36:38,572 --> 00:36:40,282
- Just go walk it off.
- Walk it off?

616
00:36:40,366 --> 00:36:42,159
She broke my fucking wrist!

617
00:36:42,242 --> 00:36:43,994
She didn't intend any harm.

618
00:36:44,078 --> 00:36:46,121
Could have fooled me.

619
00:36:46,205 --> 00:36:49,333
- Get out! I'm going to the hospital.
- Not till we get what we came for.

620
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:51,210
- Fuck you! The session's over!
- Sit down!

621
00:36:53,629 --> 00:36:55,255
Okay, listen.

622
00:36:55,339 --> 00:36:57,299
I was a field medic.

623
00:36:57,383 --> 00:36:59,176
Don't look at her. Look at me.

624
00:36:59,259 --> 00:37:02,471
I can patch you up better than any of those
oxy junkies in the ER,

625
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:04,598
or I can break your other wrist.
You decide.

626
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:10,354
Good. Now, do you have
any bandages or a splint?

627
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:12,731
No, I don't have a goddamn splint!

628
00:37:16,193 --> 00:37:18,362
It's Butcher. Be quiet.

629
00:37:20,072 --> 00:37:21,990
- Butcher.
- Where are you?

630
00:37:22,074 --> 00:37:23,450
Shake Shack.

631
00:37:23,534 --> 00:37:24,785
Really?

632
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:26,954
Fucking magic, that place.

633
00:37:27,037 --> 00:37:29,456
- What'd you get?
- ShackBurger,

634
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:31,417
cheese fries,

635
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,710
- cookie dough concrete.
- Sounds good.

636
00:37:33,794 --> 00:37:35,003
Does it taste like lies?

637
00:37:35,087 --> 00:37:39,091
I got your phone linked
to my Find-Your-Shithead-Friends app.

638
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:41,218
Now, where the fuck are you?

639
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:53,647
Yes, this... This is a superhero.

640
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,983
- This is good.
- Okay.

641
00:37:56,066 --> 00:37:58,193
- We just keep...?
- Yeah, yeah.

642
00:37:58,277 --> 00:38:00,571
Well, people are always asking me, you know,

643
00:38:00,654 --> 00:38:03,198
what it's like to live with my co-workers,

644
00:38:03,282 --> 00:38:05,617
and the truth is, we're all great friends,

645
00:38:05,701 --> 00:38:08,287
you know, behind the scenes
just as much as we are to the...

646
00:38:10,456 --> 00:38:12,666
Oh, hey, Elena.

647
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:14,084
- Hey.
- This is my friend.

648
00:38:14,168 --> 00:38:15,627
I left a pile of messages for...

649
00:38:15,711 --> 00:38:17,588
Yeah, that's what we are. We're friends.

650
00:38:17,671 --> 00:38:21,300
- Can you ask them to turn that off, please?
- I'm gonna need five minutes, okay?

651
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:25,137
Yeah, we're doing a reality show.

652
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:28,932
- That's invasive.
- What are you even doing here?

653
00:38:29,016 --> 00:38:31,185
I would never turn up to your work.

654
00:38:31,268 --> 00:38:33,604
- I was worried about you.
- I had a bad night.

655
00:38:33,687 --> 00:38:36,690
This Teflon shit,
it might work for everybody else,

656
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:39,151
- but not with me.
- Will you keep your voice down?

657
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:42,154
Just tell me what's going on.

658
00:38:42,237 --> 00:38:44,490
Did you ever think that...

659
00:38:47,201 --> 00:38:49,119
maybe I was just looking for a hookup?

660
00:38:49,203 --> 00:38:50,579
I know you think you know me...

661
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:53,624
- I used to.
- Yeah, used to. I've changed.

662
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:55,834
Yeah.

663
00:38:55,918 --> 00:38:57,127
I still know you.

664
00:38:57,211 --> 00:38:59,838
- Oh, come on.
- Afraid to be seen with me.

665
00:38:59,922 --> 00:39:02,424
Afraid to ask for help.

666
00:39:02,508 --> 00:39:05,344
Just... afraid.

667
00:39:16,647 --> 00:39:18,273
Are you filming, Courtenay?

668
00:39:18,357 --> 00:39:20,651
I told you to turn
the fucking cameras off!

669
00:39:20,734 --> 00:39:23,904
We cut. We cut a while ago.
We're setting up a shot for later.

670
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:26,073
- Fucking bitch.
- B-roll on the building.

671
00:39:26,156 --> 00:39:27,866
All right, you can cut it, guys.

672
00:39:28,742 --> 00:39:29,868
It's okay.

673
00:39:29,952 --> 00:39:30,994
Everything is okay.

674
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:37,918
Gentlemen.

675
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,548
Wow, Mesmer.

676
00:39:42,631 --> 00:39:44,383
Hello.

677
00:39:44,466 --> 00:39:45,842
Big fan.

678
00:39:45,926 --> 00:39:47,678
Be with you in a minute.

679
00:39:47,761 --> 00:39:50,264
Well, now we got to kill him.

680
00:39:50,347 --> 00:39:52,224
No, we don't have to kill him.

681
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:54,059
Look, we made a deal with the guy.

682
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:56,687
If he keeps his trap shut,
he gets to see his kid.

683
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:58,647
He's just a dad with his kid.

684
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,357
He's a fucking Supe with a kid.

685
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,484
What the fuck were you thinking
coming here?

686
00:40:02,568 --> 00:40:05,237
- You know better than that.
- Sometimes you get further

687
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,864
with people by treating them like people.

688
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:13,203
Nice decor.

689
00:40:13,287 --> 00:40:16,456
'80s serial killer. Love it.

690
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,875
All right, then, let's get cracking.

691
00:40:34,641 --> 00:40:37,060
There's a camp in a jungle.

692
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:43,609
She's a soldier.

693
00:40:46,653 --> 00:40:49,531
There's a flag
with a two-headed snake on it.

694
00:40:49,615 --> 00:40:51,825
Two-headed snake?

695
00:40:51,908 --> 00:40:53,910
Like...?

696
00:40:53,994 --> 00:40:54,995
Yeah.

697
00:40:55,078 --> 00:40:57,039
- With red rays behind it?
- What does that mean?

698
00:40:57,122 --> 00:41:01,126
It's the flag of the Shining Light Liberation Army.
Frenchie...

699
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:02,961
you're dating a terrorist.

700
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,673
Is this true?

701
00:42:23,083 --> 00:42:25,961
There must be more to all of this.

702
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:27,838
She can't be a terrorist.

703
00:42:27,921 --> 00:42:30,173
Yeah, well, you just fucking
keep her under control.

704
00:42:30,257 --> 00:42:34,010
Okay, so they smuggle in
a top-shelf extremist recruit

705
00:42:34,094 --> 00:42:35,470
and pump her up with Compound V.

706
00:42:35,554 --> 00:42:37,931
When she's ready,
they cut her loose to wreak havoc.

707
00:42:38,014 --> 00:42:39,224
- She wouldn't.
- Wait.

708
00:42:39,307 --> 00:42:41,268
Why would Vought give
Compound V to terrorists?

709
00:42:41,351 --> 00:42:44,104
Because the only thing
more dangerous than a terrorist

710
00:42:44,187 --> 00:42:46,481
is a Supe terrorist,
and the only way to fight it...

711
00:42:46,565 --> 00:42:48,692
Is with Sergeant Fucking Homelander.

712
00:42:48,775 --> 00:42:51,361
Got to let the cunts in the Army now.

713
00:42:51,445 --> 00:42:54,531
Those fuckers are creating super villains.

714
00:42:54,614 --> 00:42:57,409
And maybe there's more of them,
God knows how many.

715
00:42:57,492 --> 00:42:58,326
Holy shit.

716
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:00,996
Okay, this is a clusterfuck, even for us.

717
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:03,790
No, listen to me, okay?
Maybe that's what they want her to be.

718
00:43:03,874 --> 00:43:05,959
But that's not who she is.

719
00:43:06,042 --> 00:43:08,003
- That's not what she wants.
- And you know this

720
00:43:08,086 --> 00:43:09,463
because she bends your ear off?

721
00:43:09,546 --> 00:43:12,382
She saved my life! She's not bad.

722
00:43:12,466 --> 00:43:13,967
She just want to go home.

723
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:16,261
She's a fucking Supe, just like the rest.

724
00:43:16,344 --> 00:43:19,431
How many times do I have to fucking say it, eh?

725
00:43:23,602 --> 00:43:25,812
Mon coeur, I know you understand me.

726
00:43:25,896 --> 00:43:27,814
Please. Please.

727
00:43:27,898 --> 00:43:29,316
Tell them who you are.

728
00:43:29,399 --> 00:43:30,734
Tell them what I see.

729
00:43:41,578 --> 00:43:42,662
No.

730
00:44:11,775 --> 00:44:16,321
The drawings are palm trees in front of the moon.
It's where she grew up.

731
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:21,368
They killed her parents.

732
00:44:21,451 --> 00:44:24,246
They kidnapped her and her brother.

733
00:44:24,329 --> 00:44:26,998
Forced them to be soldiers.

734
00:44:31,753 --> 00:44:32,838
No, Kimiko...

735
00:44:33,755 --> 00:44:35,215
You eat it.

736
00:44:35,715 --> 00:44:38,802
She just wants to go back
and get her brother out of there.

737
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:44,766
Her name's Kimiko.

738
00:44:50,897 --> 00:44:52,148
Kimiko.

739
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,155
Bonjour, Kimiko.

740
00:45:05,495 --> 00:45:08,623
All right, take her back to the safe house.

741
00:45:09,958 --> 00:45:11,626
Where you headed?

742
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:13,753
I'm gonna go see Raynor.

743
00:45:13,837 --> 00:45:16,965
We've got more than enough
to get the feds onboard now.

744
00:45:19,843 --> 00:45:23,555
You tell anyone what you saw
or heard here today,

745
00:45:23,638 --> 00:45:27,767
and I'll cut your hands off
and shove them so far up your ass,

746
00:45:27,851 --> 00:45:30,562
your fingers will give us a little wave
out your throat, yeah?

747
00:45:34,733 --> 00:45:36,985
Fuck off, wanker.

748
00:45:40,822 --> 00:45:44,200
Some controversial news today
as the Deep went public with his apology.

749
00:45:44,284 --> 00:45:46,077
I realise that my behaviour

750
00:45:46,161 --> 00:45:48,330
caused Starlight a great deal of pain...

751
00:45:49,831 --> 00:45:52,334
...and I sincerely apologise.

752
00:45:52,417 --> 00:45:55,086
Fuck you, fish dick!

753
00:45:56,546 --> 00:45:58,590
Keep speaking your truth!

754
00:45:59,591 --> 00:46:01,885
I'm in full support of women

755
00:46:01,968 --> 00:46:03,470
and their ongoing bravery...

756
00:46:04,512 --> 00:46:06,765
Never got the point of these.

757
00:46:06,848 --> 00:46:10,018
To me, they always looked
like Granddad's bollocks flopping in the wind.

758
00:46:12,896 --> 00:46:15,607
Do you have the Compound V or not?

759
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:17,817
I've got the Compound V...

760
00:46:19,069 --> 00:46:21,905
proof that Vought's injected babies
right across the country,

761
00:46:21,988 --> 00:46:24,574
and something even more fucking diabolical.

762
00:46:24,658 --> 00:46:26,159
Worse than dosing babies?

763
00:46:26,242 --> 00:46:28,370
Let's just say, with these cunts,

764
00:46:28,453 --> 00:46:30,080
there ain't no rock bottom.

765
00:46:31,623 --> 00:46:34,084
Let's get it to the lab...

766
00:46:34,167 --> 00:46:35,043
Not so fast.

767
00:46:38,588 --> 00:46:40,507
First things first, eh?

768
00:46:41,675 --> 00:46:43,259
A list of your demands.

769
00:46:43,343 --> 00:46:45,011
How in character.

770
00:46:46,429 --> 00:46:49,683
Exorbitant salary. Same for your team.
Office space,

771
00:46:49,766 --> 00:46:51,351
in the Flatiron Building, no less.

772
00:46:51,434 --> 00:46:53,478
Security clearance. Indemnity clause.

773
00:46:53,561 --> 00:46:55,021
Legal protection.

774
00:46:55,105 --> 00:46:57,857
A formal guarantee
that Homelander will be prosecuted

775
00:46:57,941 --> 00:46:59,901
under the full extent of the law.

776
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:03,363
Any of that a problem?

777
00:47:03,446 --> 00:47:05,490
No, gonna pass it up the chain.

778
00:47:05,573 --> 00:47:07,492
And while they hash it out,

779
00:47:07,575 --> 00:47:10,120
you and I go forward on good faith.

780
00:47:12,372 --> 00:47:14,499
I'm fresh out of good faith.

781
00:47:14,582 --> 00:47:18,253
Now, you and I both know
that you can rubber-stamp all of that.

782
00:47:18,336 --> 00:47:20,046
So what's it gonna be...

783
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:21,256
deputy director?

784
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:23,258
I can give you...

785
00:47:24,259 --> 00:47:26,553
everything you want on this list...

786
00:47:26,636 --> 00:47:28,972
Except?

787
00:47:29,055 --> 00:47:31,391
Except Homelander.

788
00:47:36,646 --> 00:47:37,981
You know what he's done.

789
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,369
I sympathise.

790
00:47:52,579 --> 00:47:53,788
I really do.

791
00:47:53,872 --> 00:47:55,665
- But it's suicide.
- Yeah, well,

792
00:47:55,749 --> 00:47:58,543
- that's a small fucking price to pay, isn't it?
- Not for you.

793
00:47:58,626 --> 00:48:01,337
For thousands of people
if you push him too hard.

794
00:48:01,421 --> 00:48:03,381
You're fucking scared.

795
00:48:03,465 --> 00:48:05,341
I'm fucking terrified.

796
00:48:05,425 --> 00:48:07,844
And you should be, too.

797
00:48:13,975 --> 00:48:14,934
Butcher!

798
00:48:16,352 --> 00:48:18,146
Butcher!

799
00:48:37,624 --> 00:48:39,751
This small-town girl next door

800
00:48:39,834 --> 00:48:41,878
wanted to change the world.

801
00:48:41,961 --> 00:48:46,299
Since when did hopeful
and naive become the same thing?

802
00:48:46,382 --> 00:48:49,552
But the world had other plans.

803
00:48:49,636 --> 00:48:51,429
Starlight, I hope you can forgive me.

804
00:48:51,513 --> 00:48:52,889
Battered and beaten,

805
00:48:52,972 --> 00:48:56,643
a phoenix rose from the ashes
with a message so loud,

806
00:48:56,726 --> 00:49:01,356
so raw, it couldn't come forth
as anything less than a roar.

807
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:04,192
Witness her power.

808
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:05,443
Hear her truth.

809
00:49:05,527 --> 00:49:07,779
And I'm done taking any more shit.

810
00:49:07,862 --> 00:49:12,617
Watch her stand up and fight back for all of us.

811
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:15,787
Citizen Starlight,
coming this fall from Vought.

812
00:49:16,913 --> 00:49:19,165
The house always wins.

813
00:49:24,712 --> 00:49:25,922
I'm sorry.

814
00:49:47,527 --> 00:49:51,030
I know you want to go back to your brother.

815
00:49:54,826 --> 00:49:57,537
But the people who did this to you...

816
00:49:57,620 --> 00:50:01,082
You know, they might be doing it to others.

817
00:50:01,166 --> 00:50:03,835
We can use your help stopping them.

818
00:50:12,135 --> 00:50:14,387
It's your choice.

819
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:18,725
You give me a nod, and we go
to the airport right now.

820
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:39,037
No. Baby, why you want to do me like that?

821
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:42,582
Because if you watch that episode
of Downton Abbey,

822
00:50:42,665 --> 00:50:44,083
then I'm gonna be one behind

823
00:50:44,167 --> 00:50:46,628
and we're not gonna be able
to binge watch together.

824
00:50:46,711 --> 00:50:48,922
Just hold off until I get home.

825
00:50:49,005 --> 00:50:52,634
There's a fight in the yard, baby.
I got to go. All right.

826
00:50:53,593 --> 00:50:54,844
How'd it go with Raynor?

827
00:50:56,012 --> 00:50:57,555
No dice.

828
00:50:57,639 --> 00:50:59,015
What?

829
00:50:59,098 --> 00:51:01,476
Said she got cold feet.

830
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:03,269
Well, why?
Did you tell her everything?

831
00:51:03,353 --> 00:51:06,439
Yeah, I laid it all out, even the sample of V.

832
00:51:06,522 --> 00:51:10,985
Said she couldn't fucking authorise
that kind of action against Vought.

833
00:51:11,069 --> 00:51:13,154
Too much of a risk.

834
00:51:14,197 --> 00:51:15,531
Did she?

835
00:51:15,615 --> 00:51:17,075
Fucking spineless cunt.

836
00:51:17,158 --> 00:51:19,035
So we are royally fucked.

837
00:51:20,536 --> 00:51:21,996
No, we ain't.

838
00:51:23,122 --> 00:51:26,167
Fuck them. We don't need them.

839
00:51:26,251 --> 00:51:30,588
We got everyone and everything
we need right here in this room.

840
00:51:30,672 --> 00:51:34,050
We'll take down Vought ourselves. Yeah?

841
00:51:38,972 --> 00:51:40,014
Where's Hughie?

842
00:51:42,809 --> 00:51:44,060
This is Tina Mitchell,

843
00:51:44,143 --> 00:51:46,145
Department of Child Protection
and Permanency.

844
00:51:46,229 --> 00:51:47,855
Leave a message.

845
00:51:47,939 --> 00:51:50,525
Tina, it's Mesmer.

846
00:51:50,608 --> 00:51:52,819
You met me earlier.

847
00:51:56,572 --> 00:51:59,492
Cleo didn't really want to see me today.

848
00:51:59,575 --> 00:52:02,620
She was just being polite.

849
00:52:04,247 --> 00:52:06,791
I'm pretty good at reading stuff like that, so...

850
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:10,336
You don't have to call me,

851
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:12,964
or any of that anymore.

852
00:52:14,299 --> 00:52:16,175
Just, it's okay.

853
00:52:16,259 --> 00:52:19,429
Just... Just... please...

854
00:52:20,805 --> 00:52:22,140
look after her.

855
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:25,059
Thank you.

856
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:37,405
I'm sorry. The elevator was out.

857
00:52:40,658 --> 00:52:42,827
You probably don't remember,
but we've met before.

858
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:49,208
- I would never try and read you.
- Let's be clear.

859
00:52:49,292 --> 00:52:52,879
I don't know you, and I don't want to.

860
00:52:53,921 --> 00:52:56,591
A-Train said
that you have some information.

861
00:52:56,674 --> 00:52:59,635
Yeah, we... We go back to the Teenage Kix days.

862
00:52:59,719 --> 00:53:01,679
- We still keep in touch.
- Oh, golly gee shucks.

863
00:53:01,763 --> 00:53:04,057
What makes you think I would
give two fucks about that?

864
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:07,977
Now, do you have something
for me or not?

865
00:53:08,061 --> 00:53:09,354
Yeah.

866
00:53:10,772 --> 00:53:17,320
He said you were looking for a French guy...
and a black guy...

867
00:53:19,113 --> 00:53:20,073
a skinny white guy,

868
00:53:20,156 --> 00:53:21,949
British guy.

869
00:53:24,118 --> 00:53:25,119
Where are these from?

870
00:53:25,203 --> 00:53:29,499
Shitty little $85 camera
I put in my doorbell casing.

871
00:53:29,582 --> 00:53:33,378
I know there's no reward, but I was hoping
you could put in a word for me at Vought.

872
00:53:34,921 --> 00:53:37,465
I'll take any posting.

873
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:39,926
Low five-figures would be fine.

874
00:53:41,677 --> 00:53:44,097
I just want to be one
of the good guys again.

875
00:53:59,904 --> 00:54:01,531
Oh, that's my phone.

876
00:54:05,076 --> 00:54:06,160
I mean, I don't remember,

877
00:54:06,244 --> 00:54:10,832
but my mom said that when I was born,
I almost blinded the doctor.

878
00:54:10,915 --> 00:54:15,002
So, I had powers from the start. Why?

879
00:54:15,086 --> 00:54:18,131
No, no, I'm just curious.

880
00:54:20,341 --> 00:54:22,760
Do you mind if we just...

881
00:54:22,844 --> 00:54:24,595
not talk about hero stuff tonight?

882
00:54:24,679 --> 00:54:26,722
Yeah, yeah. Bad day at work?

883
00:54:26,806 --> 00:54:28,933
Yeah. It's an understatement.

884
00:54:30,268 --> 00:54:31,602
You know,

885
00:54:32,812 --> 00:54:36,858
there's this beach in the Bahamas
where the sand is pink,

886
00:54:36,941 --> 00:54:39,444
like, cotton-candy pink.

887
00:54:39,527 --> 00:54:41,320
What's it called?

888
00:54:41,404 --> 00:54:42,738
Pink Sands.

889
00:54:42,822 --> 00:54:44,991
It's not the most creative name,

890
00:54:45,074 --> 00:54:48,578
but... let's just go.

891
00:54:48,661 --> 00:54:51,914
Yeah. No, I can learn how to play the steel drum.

892
00:54:51,998 --> 00:54:53,583
You can get cornrows.

893
00:54:53,666 --> 00:54:54,834
How about tonight?

894
00:54:54,917 --> 00:54:56,127
Book that ticket.

895
00:54:59,881 --> 00:55:02,091
Are we talking about this?

896
00:55:03,759 --> 00:55:05,970
I don't know. I...

897
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:07,346
I just know that...

898
00:55:08,723 --> 00:55:13,478
for me, New York has been such
an endless shit show.

899
00:55:13,561 --> 00:55:15,688
Except for you.

900
00:55:17,982 --> 00:55:20,776
Somehow, in the middle of it all...

901
00:55:24,447 --> 00:55:25,490
you found me.

902
00:55:53,392 --> 00:55:55,144
Hughie.

903
00:55:58,523 --> 00:55:59,690
I thought that was you.

904
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:03,277
Oh, I apologise.

905
00:56:03,361 --> 00:56:04,779
I didn't mean to interrupt.

906
00:56:04,862 --> 00:56:05,988
No.

907
00:56:06,072 --> 00:56:07,990
Hi, I'm Annie.

908
00:56:08,074 --> 00:56:10,493
Billy. Old mate of Hughie's.

909
00:56:10,576 --> 00:56:13,704
Oh, boy, you really have a lot of friends
showing up here.

910
00:56:13,788 --> 00:56:16,165
Yeah. Seems like it.

911
00:56:17,416 --> 00:56:20,378
You're that new girl in the Seven, ain't you?

912
00:56:20,461 --> 00:56:23,339
- Guilty.
- Wow, it is a pleasure to meet you.

913
00:56:23,422 --> 00:56:25,633
And I must say how marvellous it is

914
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:27,885
that so many more women are
in positions of power.

915
00:56:27,969 --> 00:56:29,637
You know what I mean?

916
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:32,890
You know, if I'm perfectly honest,

917
00:56:32,974 --> 00:56:36,602
Translucent's always been my favourite.

918
00:56:36,686 --> 00:56:38,688
What's he up to?

919
00:56:38,771 --> 00:56:40,481
I think he's on a mission.

920
00:56:40,565 --> 00:56:42,441
Yeah, I think I read that, actually.

921
00:56:42,525 --> 00:56:44,819
He's been gone a long time,
though, hasn't he?

922
00:56:44,902 --> 00:56:47,196
I do hope he's all right.

923
00:56:49,115 --> 00:56:52,994
You know what?
I'm gonna go get us a pitcher.

924
00:56:53,077 --> 00:56:54,203
Billy, you like...

925
00:56:54,287 --> 00:56:55,663
Let me guess. Guinness?

926
00:56:55,746 --> 00:56:57,957
I like what you like.

927
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:00,084
All right. Be right back.

928
00:57:02,503 --> 00:57:04,422
- Well, well, well.
- Butcher...

929
00:57:04,505 --> 00:57:06,841
She's quite tasty up close and personal.

930
00:57:06,924 --> 00:57:09,218
- I get what you see in her.
- That wasn't what...

931
00:57:09,302 --> 00:57:11,178
I thought we had an understanding.

932
00:57:11,262 --> 00:57:12,388
We do. We do.

933
00:57:12,471 --> 00:57:15,224
- It... It's not what...
- Not what it looks like?

934
00:57:15,308 --> 00:57:17,727
Because from where I'm sitting,
it looks like

935
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:20,563
you've got your tongue halfway down
the opposition's throat.

936
00:57:20,646 --> 00:57:22,857
She is not the opposition.

937
00:57:25,276 --> 00:57:27,194
She's a good person, okay?

938
00:57:27,278 --> 00:57:28,696
I mean, she could help us.

939
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:31,115
- Help us?
- Yeah.

940
00:57:33,451 --> 00:57:35,578
And what do you think she's gonna do

941
00:57:35,661 --> 00:57:38,456
when she finds out
you murdered Translucent?

942
00:57:40,583 --> 00:57:42,084
When she finds out?

943
00:57:46,714 --> 00:57:48,591
Give her my best.

944
00:57:53,638 --> 00:57:55,473
Where'd your friend go?

945
00:57:55,497 --> 00:58:03,497
