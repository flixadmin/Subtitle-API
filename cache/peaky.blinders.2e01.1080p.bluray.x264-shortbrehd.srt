1
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,889
I'll be in London one week,
at this address.

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,447
Finish your business here
and join me.

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,090
<i>"Dear Grace...</i>

4
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,726
<i>"Before the war, when I had
an important decision to make,</i>

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,004
<i>"I used to flip a coin.</i>

6

I will do again."</i>
<b><font color="#0A7C32">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

7
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,291
...and give him peace. Amen.

8
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,690
Amen.

9
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,167
I promised my friend
Freddie Thorne

10
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,642
that I'd say a few words
over his grave

11
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,404
if he should pass before me.

12
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,605
I made this promise before
he became me brother-in-law.

13
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,682
When we were in France,
fighting for the King.

14
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,886
Amen.

15
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,249
And in the end it
wasn't war that took Freddie.

16
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,005
--Pestilence took him.

17
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,442
Come here.

18
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:38,282
But Freddie passed on his soul
and his spirit to a new generation

19
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,131
- before he was cruelly taken.

20
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,008
We thought, now Freddie's gone,

21
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,126
- you might come back to Birmingham.

22
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,971
God, do you know how funny it is

23
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,566
that you've got
chauffeurs in uniform now?

24
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,882
It's just for the occasion, Ada.

25
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,004
Do you know how unfair it is

26
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,209
that you've got four Bugattis
when half the country's starving?

27
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,603
So now they've made you ashamed
of us, eh?

28
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,883
Sometimes when I think how I used
to be, it makes me embarrassed.

29
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,450
Karl's with his cousins.

30
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,326
I caught 'em trying
to pinch flowers off a grave.

31
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,681
Ada.

32
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,965
Are you coming home?

33
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,645
I'm going home.

34
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,525
It's all right, Poll.
We make Ada embarrassed.

35
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,284
That's not what I said.

36
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,722
There's another reason
we want you home.

37
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,203
We're planning an expansion.

38
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,203
- I'm taking premises in London...

39
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,282
Tommy, it's a funeral,
business can wait.

40
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,728
Polly, if Ada was
weeping then I'd stop.

41
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,165
But she's not.

42
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,482
The expansion means
it's going to be dangerous

43
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,324
to be a Shelby in London
for a while.

44
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,881
Yeah.

45
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,322
Well, I'm not a Shelby any more.

46
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,362
And I'm not a Thorne now, either.

47
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,446
I'm free.

48
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,809
I've got to get Karl home.

49
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,808
--I told you.

50
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,731
Let me do it.

51
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,371
It's all right.

52
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,610
I'll have some men watch her house
till the danger passes.

53
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,968
"Till the danger passes"?

54
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,165
That'll be the bloody day.

55
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,091
Go on, move away, go on.

56
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,331
It happened at, uh, exactly 7 a.m.

57
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,366
Nobody saw anything.
Our patrols were not in the area.

58
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,968
Mr Shelby, have you got
any idea who might've done it?

59
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,809
I'd say it was something to do
with the gas.

60
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,844
It's just been fitted.

61
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,366
Er, madam, the structure's
not yet declared safe.

62
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,371
--Madam!

63
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,963
This is all over the place.

64
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,040
Confetti.

65
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,840
You can go.

66
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,127
Right.

67
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,321
Who?

68
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,290
Who did this to us?

69
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,241
Whiskey. Irish.

70
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,167
I heard there was a bit of a bang
in your part of town.

71
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,243
Gas and electric don't mix.

72
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,364
Who'd have thought
they would, eh?

73
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,921
How's business otherwise,
Mr Shelby?

74
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,605
You know something?

75
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,402
In these times of hunger
and hardship,

76
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,369
business is surprisingly good.

77
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,480
Which one of you is
the Peaky Blinder devil?

78
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,085
Gentlemen.

79
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,809
Finn! Get in here.

80
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,201
Finn! Hold the phone. Come here.

81
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,049
- Take the odds.
-Yeah, sure.

82
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,800
Polly.

83
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,364
Did he say who did it?

84
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,363
He's gone to the Black Lion.

85
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,526
On his own?

86
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,367
Tommy does everything on his own.

87
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,080
- Should I go to the Black Lion?
-What?

88
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,640
- Should I go there and see him?
-No.

89
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,369
Where the fuck is Arthur?

90
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,171
Protecting the Garrison's
whisky from the police.

91
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,489
For fuck's sake!

92
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,851
Polly, it feels a little bit to me
like things are getting out of hand.

93
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,405
So get 'em in hand.

94
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,362
Do you know what Ada said to me
this morning?

95
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:47,127
She said we all look like we work
in a factory under the ground.

96
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,448
She said we look like ghosts.

97
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,846
She'll be back.

98
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,761
When?

99
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,731
When she needs us.

100
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,410
And anyway, who the fuck
would blow up our pub?

101
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,171
- Six.
-Six what?

102
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,601
Six questions since
you walked through the door.

103
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,243
Soon you're going to have to start
being the man with the answers.

104
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,367
Why?

105
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,446
Seven.

106
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,523
Because when London happens,
you'll have to hold up your end

107
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,403
or we'll find somebody else who can.

108
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,686
--Thomas Shelby.

109
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,245
You blew up my pub.

110
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,081
Anger defeats fear, good.

111
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,770
You blew up my pub.

112
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,240
Tommy has a reputation to uphold.

113
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,410
A reputation for not being
scared of anything.

114
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:08,969
In all the world, violent men
are the easiest to deal with.

115
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,564
So tell me, which brand
of rebel are you, eh?

116
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,569
I read somewhere that you Paddies

117
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,642
started fighting
amongst yourselves, now.

118
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,529
The King offers you a peace treaty
and you start a war about it.

119
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,651
That's funny, don't you think?

120
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,969
A war about peace.

121
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,926
So are you for the treaty
or against the treaty?

122
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,162
Forgive me, I get confused.

123
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,762
You are one decision away
from death, Mr Shelby.

124
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,688
So stop fucking smiling.

125
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,128
Your name is Irene O'Donnell.

126
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,728
You have a son at the
Cherrywood Road School in Harborne.

127
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,883
He has irons on his legs,
his name is Sean,

128
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:09,760
he comes last
in every race, poor boy.

129
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,322
Poor boy if the race was important.

130
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,289
Do you know what I mean,
Irene O'Donnell?

131
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,328
There are other ways of
carrying out this mission.

132
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,688
Please allow me to put a bullet
in this scum tinker's head.

133
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,681
No.

134
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,327
He researches his enemies,

135
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,529
that's why he's been chosen.

136
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,651
I am chosen?

137
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,281
I'm chosen.

138
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,203
Can the chosen one smoke?

139
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,925
A vacancy has appeared
and you're going to fill it.

140
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,691
Chosen by whom?

141
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,328
By an informed consensus.

142
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,685
I have things to do.

143
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,647
So perhaps you could tell
the chosen one

144
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,082
what he's been chosen for.

145
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,683
From now on, Mr Shelby,

146
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,324
you shut your fucking gypsy mouth
and listen to your instructions.

147
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,610
Fuck!

148
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,686
I need the area round
the co-operative stables

149
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,889
clear of coppers between
midnight and 4:00 tonight.

150
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,249
Right. Could I ask why?

151
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:30,644
Well, whatever it is you're
going to do, don't start any fires.

152
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,087
The firemen go out
on strike at midnight.

153
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,808
That's all. You can go.

154
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,289
I've got some information
you might be interested in.

155
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,240
No charge.

156
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,051
There's an old friend of ours
coming back to the city.

157
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,442
He's, uh, just passing through, he says.

158
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,606
Very grand these days.

159
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,251
He's head of some
secret department,

160
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,251
the Irish Desk.

161
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,770
So I doubt he'll be bothering
with the likes of us, eh?

162
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,404
I'll say good night, Tom.

163
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,165
I demand to speak
to a representative!

164
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,650
A representative of
His Majesty the King!

165
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,322
Father! Father!

166
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,449
It was the Ulsterman,
the man with the wolf head!

167
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,045
Get the fuck off me!

168
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,964
You must reconcile yourself
with the fate that awaits.

169
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,362
I demand to speak to a representative
of His Majesty the King!

170
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,726
Make your peace with God.

171
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,849
A representative of
His Majesty the King!

172
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,490
- Father.
-Come on.

173
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,528
Now, wait!
Where are you going?

174
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,405
Does someone here have
business with the King?

175
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,605
Major Campbell.

176
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,967
--About time.

177
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,569
I am a very busy man, Governor.

178
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,125
In seven and a half minutes,

179
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,885
the man in that cell
is due to be hanged for murder.

180
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,810
The murder of an Irish activist
in Whitechapel.

181
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,565
Does the case ring any bells,
Major Campbell?

182
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,126
No, Governor,

183
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,165
I hear no bells.

184
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,485
Since yesterday morning,

185
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,562
he's been claiming that the murder
was ordered

186
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,722
by the British
Secret Intelligence Service.

187
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,804
It's a little late
to be coming up with nonsense like that,

188
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,086
don't you think?

189
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,003
He was told if he kept
his mouth shut

190
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,003
there would be a last-minute pardon,

191
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,362
which has not materialised.

192
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,404
Forgive me, Governor,

193
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,726
but what business is this of mine?

194
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,005
He says the man who hired him

195
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,526
was an Intelligence Service
Chief of Staff,

196
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,891
an Ulsterman.

197
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,926
Carries a cane
with a wolf-head handle,

198
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,002
a bullet wound in his right leg.

199
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,921
No.

200
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,162
Still no bells. Governor,

201
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,089
you have a very clear remit.

202
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,246
Part of that remit is
to oversee the smooth completion

203
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,649
of executions
sanctioned by the Crown.

204
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,688
And in the next four minutes it is
your duty to escort that man

205
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,969
to the gates of hell.

206
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,006
Is that clear?

207
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,402
And if you should ever have
the desire

208
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,006
to discuss this matter
with anyone else

209
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,046
I know where you live.

210
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,767
Arthur, Tommy's
called a family meeting.

211
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,447
Arthur!

212
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,841
He just beat the shit out of
an apprentice.

213
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,400
I had to take half the kid away
in buckets.

214
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,846
Arthur.

215
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,165
2,000.

216
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,491
Come on.

217
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,491
Sit down, Finn.

218
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,204
- Where the bloody hell is Tommy?
-He's on his way.

219
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,246
All right then,
while we're waiting patiently...

220
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,882
Whisky.

221
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,727
Left over from the explosion.

222
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,170
It's good stuff, as well.

223
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,920
Right.

224
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,165
Before Tommy gets here,

225
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,168
I think there's a few things
we need to get straight

226
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,651
between the rest of us.

227
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,846
You think?

228
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,206
Yeah.

229
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,323
Yeah, I do. I want to know...

230
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,930
When did we all take a vote
on this expansion south?

231
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,408
You have anything to say,

232
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,290
you wait for Thomas.

233
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,691
Polly's fucking right.

234
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,330
I see all the books.

235
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,250
Legal and off track.

236
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,409
Sort of stuff you don't see.

237
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,885
And in the past year

238
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,490
the Shelby Company Limited

239
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:25,849
has been making £150

240
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,006
a day.

241
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,883
Right? A fucking day!

242
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,405
Sometimes more.

243
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,729
So what I want to know

244
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,249
is why are we changing things?

245
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,046
Polly, look what's happened already.

246
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,043
We haven't even set foot
in London yet

247
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,964
and they've already blown up
our fucking pub.

248
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,407
- Who said anything about cockneys?
-Who else?

249
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,209
Do you know who did it, do you?

250
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,927
- No, she doesn't know who did it.

251
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,647
I'm told only family
are allowed to speak.

252
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,969
Everyone's allowed to speak.

253
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:05,049
On your feet, Esme,
let's hear what you have to say.

254
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,044
I speak for our household.

255
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,886
- So...
-john, this company is

256
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,282
a modern enterprise and believes in
equal rights for women.

257
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,805
On your feet, Esme.

258
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,171
I'm not a blood member
of this family

259
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,127
but perhaps, indeed,
because I'm not a member

260
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,362
I can see things
in a different light.

261
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,165
So I'll get to my point.

262
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,970
That would be nice.

263
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,326
As my husband said,

264
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,131
Shelby Company Limited
is now very successful.

265
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,089
--But London...

266
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,011
I have kin in Shepherd's Bush
and Portobello.

267
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,326
It's more like wars
between armies down there.

268
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,765
And the coppers fight
side-by-side with them.

269
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,922
And there are foreigners
of every description

270
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,327
and the use of bombs
is the least of it.

271
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,450
I have a child,

272
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,321
blessed with the Shelby family
good looks.

273
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,802
I want John to see him grow up.

274
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:25,040
I want us to someday live somewhere
with fresh air and trees

275
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,209
and keep chickens or something.

276
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,366
But London is just smoke
and trouble, Thomas.

277
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,041
Thomas?

278
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,205
That's all I have to say.

279
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:45,530
That was a lot of words,
a lot of words.

280
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,488
Wash them down with a nice drink.

281
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,491
Thank you, Esme.

282
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,130
Firstly, the bang in the pub
had nothing to do with London.

283
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,486
Understood?

284
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,722
The bang is something
I'm dealing with on my own.

285
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,691
Secondly, we've nothing to fear
from the proposed business expansion

286
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,569
so long as we stick together.

287
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,086
And after the first few weeks,

288
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,401
nine tenths of what we do in London
will be legal.

289
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,522
The other tenth is in good hands.
Isn't that right, Arthur?

290
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,966
That's right.

291
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,201
Now, some of you in this room
have expressed your reservations.

292
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,486
Fair enough.

293
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,929
Any of you who want no part
in the future of this company,

294
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,571
walk out the door...

295
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,051
Right now.

296
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,404
Go raise your chickens.

297
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,682
For those of you with ambition

298
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,642
the expansion process
begins tomorrow.

299
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,925
Tomorrow?

300
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,085
I'm company treasurer,
you should speak to me first.

301
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,123
It's Newmarket tomorrow,
third busiest day of the year.

302
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,770
We have 18 staff.

303
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,161
Who you trust with 200 quid takings?

304
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,402
Oh, I changed the combination.

305
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,685
--So what's going on, Thomas?

306
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,648
Who'd you meet at the Black Lion?

307
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,648
Give me the combination, Polly.

308
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:38,084
Polly, give me the combination.

309
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,041
What happened to the pub
is Irish business.

310
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,488
We're in a situation where,
for everyone's safety,

311
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,450
it's best if some things
remain undisclosed.

312
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,651
So why tomorrow?

313
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,682
Like you say,
tomorrow's Newmarket.

314
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,922
All the London bosses
will be at the races.

315
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,282
What say you just roll up
and take the city?

316
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:08,002
No, we take the opportunity
to show our hand.

317
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,808
The Italian gangs
and the Jewish gangs

318
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,803
have been at war in London
for six months.

319
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,006
It's not our war.

320
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,401
The Jews have been having
the worst of it. They need allies.

321
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,847
- Yeah, but we don't.
-We need a foothold

322
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,002
at the southern end
of the Grand Union.

323
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,242
The Jews control Camden Town.

324
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,890
Your mother said,

325
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,408
"It's his cleverness
that'll kill him."

326
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,209
No-one gets killed, Polly.

327
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:45,162
We go down tomorrow when it's quiet
and we leave our message.

328
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,449
If Alfie Solomon
and his Camden boys come to us,

329
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,921
we'll negotiate the use
of a secure bonded warehouse

330
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,731
and then our legal activities
in London can begin.

331
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:57,885
Now please, open the fucking safe.

332
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,488
Do you know, it was a fine speech
you made in there,

333
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:11,682
about this company believing
in equal rights for women.

334
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,609
But when it comes to it,

335
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,802
you don't listen to a word we say.

336
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,004
Maybe you don't trust us.

337
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,604
She was one woman, Thomas.

338
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,841
Well, maybe it's time
you forgot about her.

339
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,410
Forgot about who?

340
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,966
You and the boys,
go and get yourselves killed.

341
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,443
Are you going to London now?

342
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,408
No, there's something
I have to do first.

343
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,931
Oh, I've got a typewriter like that.

344
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,244
I got it out of a catalogue.

345
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,286
I'm doing a correspondence course.

346
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,249
I'm learning to do it
with my eyes shut.

347
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,970
It's a test you have to do.

348
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,602
Will you come back before you go?

349
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,406
No.

350
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:42,324
I wish, just once,
you wouldn't pay me,

351
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,689
as if we were ordinary people.

352
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,161
Yeah.

353
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,525
Let's begin.

354
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,810
Hands on the table.

355
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,721
Tonight we have two
new pilgrims joining us.

356
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,962
So, let's welcome them.

357
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,805
Starting with you.

358
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,727
Who is it that
you're seeking to reach?

359
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,005
My husband.

360
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,770
He was taken six months ago
by the influenza.

361
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,451
I tried to reach him through
Mrs Breach at Sparkhill

362
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,364
but she kept getting
his middle name wrong.

363
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,530
Don't talk about Mrs Breach
in this house.

364
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,651
She's an unsanctified charlatan.

365
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,840
And you?

366
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,730
Who do you seek?

367
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,728
Well, truth...

368
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,770
Sorry, truth is,
I'm not even sure she's dead.

369
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,842
So I came here to find out.

370
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,800
Er...

371
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,002
You see, my son and my daughter

372
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:08,005
were taken from me
when they were very small.

373
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,044
Taken by the parish authorities

374
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,043
and I never knew
what happened to them.

375
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,124
But lately...

376
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,490
I've had a feeling.

377
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,005
Like, a feeling...

378
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,043
I can't put it into words.

379
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,206
And I keep having a dream.

380
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,410
I see a pretty girl,

381
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,130
about 18-yea rs-old.

382
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,446
She's standing
across the street

383
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,165
and she tells me
she's passed over.

384
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:56,805
Now, my daughter
would have been 18 this year.

385
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,841
On May 15th.

386
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:09,171
And this girl has dark eyes
like mine.

387
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:17,486
And she shouts and shouts.

388
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:23,210
And she tells me
she wants to talk to me

389
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,210
because I'm her mother.

390
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,925
Now, I don't even know
what name they gave her

391
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,368
after they stole her from me.

392
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,967
But if she does want
to say goodbye,

393
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,923
I thought this would be the place.

394
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,962
You're wearing the Black Madonna.

395
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,120
You're gypsy?

396
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,130
The part of me that dreams is gypsy.

397
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,082
My maiden name is Shelby.

398
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,886
So,

399
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,728
perhaps you could do me first.

400
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,685
No!

401
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,685
No!

402
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,930
No!

403
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,244
No...

404
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,885
Eamonn Duggan?

405
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,449
All right, Tommy's here.

406
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,330
Hang on!

407
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,520
John!

408
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,931
I'm coming!

409
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:44,005
7 o'clock, 12 o'clock,

410
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,809
10 if I'm still sober.

411
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,243
I got it from the doctor.

412
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,522
Keeps me nice and calm.

413
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,643
Same thing they gave us
in the trenches

414
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,484
to stop us fucking wanking.

415
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,164
Polly said it's good for me temper.

416
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,208
- It slows me down, Tom.
-Arthur,

417
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:04,086
there are some things
Polly doesn't understand.

418
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:08,006
- I need you fast. Not slow, eh?

419
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,804
She wouldn't let go
of my fucking leg.

420
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,484
I bet that's not all
she wouldn't let go of.

421
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:15,770
Right. You know she's against this, Tom.
She's got opinions.

422
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,524
Nothing wrong with opinions, john.
Come on.

423
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,284
- Get in the fucking car!
-Shut up.

424
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,611
Right!

425
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,604
The Peaky Blinders are going
on fucking holiday!

426
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,967
Sit down, you mad bastard.

427
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,961
You're against this
the same as me, aren't you?

428
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,966
Look out for anyone putting
big money on Divine Star

429
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,008
in the 3:30 at Newmarket.

430
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,205
She's one of ours.

431
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,244
Anything over a pound, tell me.

432
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,927
Polly,

433
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,447
I don't wish to pry
into your business,

434
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,770
but you should know something.

435
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,048
That woman is a trickster.

436
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,725
What woman?

437
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,886
Her sister was in
the washhouse early,

438
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:36,006
boasting there'd been
a Shelby at the table.

439
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,166
What woman?

440
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,969
Gypsies talk to each other.

441
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,729
What woman?

442
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,851
You went to see Mrs Price
in the Patch last night.

443
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,565
I'm sorry...

444
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,885
So what do you know?

445
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,884
I know they push the glass.

446
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,203
The man, it's her cousin.
He pushes the glass.

447
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,441
It's a trick.

448
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,048
They tell you what
you already believe.

449
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,924
She set up after the war
because of all the widows.

450
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:19,122
Polly, I just thought
you should know.

451
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,043
And in this fucking washhouse,

452
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,963
did they tell you why I went there?

453
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,888
You tell a soul in this family,

454
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:37,202
and I swear I will cut you.

455
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:43,324
I don't need a knife to stop me
telling secrets given in confidence.

456
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,489
It is a matter of honour.

457
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,124
Look at this! Look.

458
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,845
- I love it.

459
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,441
Your Esme was right
about one thing,

460
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,807
you can't beat the countryside.

461
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:20,567
You know, I think I want
to live in the country one day

462
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,610
and keep chickens.

463
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,322
Yeah, we'll see you
in London, Arthur.

464
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,480
- Oh, for fuck's sake!
-Take this.

465
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,491
We need to bury him.

466
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,164
Who the fuck is that?

467
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:40,891
It's Irish business.

468
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,201
I thought it best
if I deal with it on my own.

469
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,286
Come on, we did a thousand
of these in France.

470
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,725
John, grab his head.

471
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,048
So, we're not really
going to London?

472
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,290
Once we bury him,

473
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,484
then the holiday begins.

474
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,725
Much obliged.

475
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,327
It's a fucking freak show.

476
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:55,446
What the fuck is that racket?

477
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,807
This is what they call music
these days, brother.

478
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,041
Music?

479
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,401
oi!

480
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,926
Oi! Put it away.

481
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,365
Fuck off!

482
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,487
Fucking look at this spot, eh?

483
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,570
It's all right, isn't it?

484
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,480
Irish whiskey, a bottle.

485
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,810
And hurry UP!

486
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:45,530
Fucking hell,

487
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,602
I recognise a few of these lads.

488
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,769
That's Sabini's cousin, over there.

489
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,211
That's right, Arthur,
it's Sabini's club.

490
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:58,722
Jesus Christ,
everybody in here's a fucking face.

491
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:02,805
Just the lieutenants, john.
No sign of the officers.

492
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:06,044
Right, let's line them up.

493
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,086
Holiday!

494
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,528
Gentlemen, there's been a mistake.

495
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,568
I'm afraid you're going to
have to leave.

496
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,643
We just bought a fucking bottle.

497
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:22,088
Some of the men here recognise you
from the racetracks in the north.

498
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,487
Yeah, we get that a lot.

499
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,609
They say you have no business
coming south of the line

500
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,569
without prior agreement.

501
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:32,007
And what line would that be,
my friend?

502
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,646
They say this is provocation.

503
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:40,443
Right, well, you tell them
we're on holiday.

504
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:43,849
You're breaking the rules.

505
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:48,809
They say you are
the Peaky Blinders...

506
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,531
Peaky scum!

507
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:15,690
Who the fuck's next?

508
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:20,451
Come here!

509
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,809
Put some ice on 'em!

510
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,291
Get out.

511
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,086
Yeah?

512
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:44,851
Yeah?

513
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,440
Are you going to use that?

514
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,480
Didn't think so.

515
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:13,402
We came here
not to make enemies.

516
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:16,566
No.

517
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,571
We came here to make new friends!

518
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,167
Those of you who are last

519
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,802
will soon be first.

520
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:37,645
And those of you who are downtrodden
will rise up.

521
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:40,806
Yup.

522
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,209
You know where to find us.

523
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,729
I think I've lost a tooth.

524
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,646
I'll have none left at this rate!

525
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,609
Some fucking holiday this is.

526
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,923
Yeah? You all right without
your fucking medicine, Arthur?

527
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,480
- Here, this'll fix you.
-Give me that!

528
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:07,847
- You, john boy, eh? How are you?

529
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,491
- Or should I ask your fucking wife?
-Oh, give over!

530
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,085
No more talk of chickens,
do you hear me?

531
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,844
--Fuck the chickens.

532
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,649
I've 50 quid in me pocket.

533
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,085
Let's paint the town, eh?

534
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:21,522
- Come.

535
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:27,686
- Oh, dear God!
-Good Lord, I assumed

536
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,524
it was Betty with tea.

537
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:33,642
Forgive me, sir, but your secretary
was not at the desk.

538
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:36,963
No, because she takes lunch,
like normal people.

539
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,487
And you can turn around,

540
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:41,211
this lady is
a professional life model.

541
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,884
She does this for a living.

542
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,051
I... I'm more than happy
to come back later, sir.

543
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:50,124
No, no, no. Later on
I'm in the House. just, erm,

544
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:54,486
keep your back turned,
if you must.

545
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:55,925
Yes, sir.

546
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:03,888
I would guess you haven't been
exposed to Bohemian society, Major?

547
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,288
Well, I... I...
I play cards on occasion.

548
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:12,809
You're a stranger to cocaine and
exotic dancing, too, I would imagine.

549
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:17,324
I find the more obvious vices
the easiest to resist.

550
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:22,247
It's the sneaky little obscure ones
that bring you to your knees, yes?

551
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:26,766
So what business is so urgent
it trumps lunch?

552
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,048
Well, sir, our man in Birmingham

553
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:31,566
has passed his first test
with flying colours.

554
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:33,449
Oh, I'm horrible at faces.

555
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:36,524
So I think we can begin to
prepare him for...

556
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:38,851
The bigger task.

557
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,321
Expressions elude me,
I think too much.

558
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:42,561
Sir?

559
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,804
I need your authority

560
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:48,690
to proceed with all urgency

561
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,522
in preparing the new man
for the bigger task.

562
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:55,211
You're talking about
your bookmaker.

563
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:56,687
Yes, sir.

564
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:00,048
You have a history with this man.
Why did you choose him?

565
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:05,371
Well, to apply pressure on a man
for this type of work

566
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,044
you have to know his weaknesses

567
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:10,727
and I know this man's
weaknesses intimately.

568
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,007
And after "mission accomplished",

569
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:15,560
do we trust him
to keep his mouth shut?

570
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:18,009
Absolutely not, sir.

571
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:21,761
So when he's served his purpose,

572
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,684
he will be consigned to history

573
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,967
in exactly the same way
as his predecessor.

574
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,361
You mean at the end of a rope?

575
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:32,689
Well, the end of the rope has
been this man's destiny

576
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:35,688
since the night he was born.

577
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:05,931
You're early.

578
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,884
Shut your eyes, Lizzie.

579
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:10,801
What?

580
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:13,884
Shut your eyes.
Go on, shut your eyes.

581
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:18,080
Good. Now, come with me.

582
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,685
No, shut your eyes!

583
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,525
--This way.

584
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,284
What are you doing, Tom?

585
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,408
You've got to sit down
here. Right.

586
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:30,530
--Sit down. Now, okay...

587
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,804
- Type this.
-Why?

588
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,325
Lizzie, type this.

589
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:37,002
"If wi..."
Put your cigarette out.

590
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:40,088
Right. "If winter comes...

591
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:44,564
--"...then can spring be far behind?"

592
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:48,008
Why?
Did you say spring?

593
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,923
Lizzie, what comes after winter?

594
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:54,966
Let's see.

595
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:57,563
That's a question.
Where's the question mark?

596
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:58,971
Put in the question mark.

597
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,764
Now type this.

598
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:05,287
"Wanted, secretary
for expanding business."

599
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:06,646
Slow down!

600
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:09,644
"Must be able to take dictation
and touch type.

601
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,210
"Five days a week.

602
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:16,126
"Uh, eight pounds
and four shillings a month.

603
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,441
"Must be able to start immediately."

604
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,086
Are you serious?

605
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,722
Things are starting
to happen, Lizzie.

606
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:31,930
I need someone who can
look the other way sometimes.

607
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,441
And you can stop
the other work too, Lizzie.

608
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:45,241
All of it this time.

609
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,531
No exceptions.

610
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,724
Eight o'clock, Monday morning,
the upstairs office.

611
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:58,881
Don't be late.

612
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:13,524
Newmarket was profitable.

613
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:16,687
Arthur told me
how you left your message.

614
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:20,320
And when I asked him
where his medicine was,

615
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,606
he said you poured it away.

616
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:24,160
All I poured away was opium
and bromide.

617
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:27,162
Oh, that's how it works
in London, isn't it?

618
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:29,891
Every boss has to have
a mad dog at his side.

619
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:33,248
Yeah, somebody who can't be
predicted, somebody mad in the head.

620
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:35,368
But Thomas Shelby
uses his own brother.

621
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:38,489
- Stop fucking fighting me!
-Somebody has to.

622
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,330
That arrived an hour ago.

623
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:44,006
There's no name on it
but it comes from Camden Town.

624
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:46,251
I was going to burn it.

625
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:47,685
I should have.

626
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:50,963
Well done, Tommy,
you've picked a side.

627
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,362
Now you're at war with Sabini.

628
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,446
Ada, are you coming for a drink?

629
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:38,171
No, the woman upstairs
is looking after Karl.

630
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:39,969
She goes mad if I'm late!

631
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,568
- Ada Shelby?
-No.

632
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:23,685
Your brother broke the rules.

633
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,046
I don't have a fucking brother.

634
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:27,600
Me and my friends here need
a bit of female company.

635
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,284
- Let's go for a drive.
-No!

636
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:31,323
- Hold her steady, boys.
-Don't! Get off!

637
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,807
- Fucking hold him!

638
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:18,564
Tommy Shelby,
I missed you at my club.

639
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,962
I was at the races.

640
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:22,771
Sabini.

641
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:26,685
Don't say my name.

642
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:29,170
Jesus!

643
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:30,766
Franco,

644
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,448
take my name out of his mouth.

645
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:45,244
While you're in there,
do a bit of digging for gold.

646
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:46,526
Pay for the petrol.

647
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:04,169
You see how much I know about you?

648
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:07,843
I even know what's in
your fucking mouth.

649
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:10,523
Look at me.
Look at me!

650
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:12,720
Look at me.

651
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:16,203
You take up with the Jews.

652
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:18,760
Yeah, you think that's
what London's all about.

653
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:21,241
You can just come down,
pick a side.

654
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:23,448
You fucking clown!

655
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,968
Now your life is over.

656
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:30,531
My face is the last thing
you'll ever see on earth.

657
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:32,285
Your mistake.

658
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:34,647
You remember that
when you get to hell.

659
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:41,645
Finish him off.

660
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:48,926
--You! Get back here!

661
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:16,762
I suppose we should
see if the bastard's still alive.
