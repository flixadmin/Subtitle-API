1
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,446
Is that estermont?

2
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,949
Tarth, ser Jaime.

3
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:22,953
The sapphire isle.

4
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:30,711
Why are we on a merchant ship?
Why no Lannister sails?

5
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:35,549
This ship's sailing to oldtown.

6
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:38,301
We'll get off earlier,
not far from sunspear,

7
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,887
row ourselves to the dornish shore
in the night.

8
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,057
You ever been to dorne?

9
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:45,892
- No.
- I have.

10
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:47,686
The dornish are crazy.

11
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:50,272
All they want to do
is fight and fuck, fuck and fight.

12
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,441
You should be happy to go back then.

13
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:56,871
There's nothing like a good fight
to get you in the mood for fucking.

14
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:00,031
And there's nothing like
a fuck-mad dornish girl

15
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:02,576
to clear your head for the next fight.

16
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,369
It's how the two work together.

17
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:07,497
Now we're gonna be doing a lot of fighting.
Well, I am.

18
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:11,251
But I don't imagine
we'll get to stick around for the rest.

19
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,003
Not after we've kidnapped their Princess.

20
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,088
We're not kidnapping their Princess.

21
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:18,341
We're rescuing my niece,
bringing her back to her family.

22
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:19,426
Your niece?

23
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:30,228
I've been doing this a long time.

24
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:32,105
- I'm good at it.
- That's why you're here.

25
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:34,065
I know. Why are you here?

26
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,693
Why not send 40 of me? Or an army?

27
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:38,914
Unlike most folks, you've actually got one.

28
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:42,157
Because I don't want to start a war.

29
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:45,202
That still doesn't explain
what you're doing here.

30
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:49,498
It has to be me.

31
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:55,629
If I'm putting something
like this together,

32
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,547
a one-handed man who happens to be

33
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:00,217
one of the most recognizable faces
in Westeros is not...

34
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,968
It has to be me.

35
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,142
You set your brother free, didn't you?

36
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,480
I'll bet your sister didn't like that.

37
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:17,484
Varys set him free.

38
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:22,906
Well,

39
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:28,078
if you ever see the wee fucker,
give him my regards.

40
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:34,251
He murdered my father.

41
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:39,923
If I ever see him, I'll split him in two.

42
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:43,134
And then I'll give him your regards.

43
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:54,521
The iron bank has called in
one-tenth of the crown's debts.

44
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:57,148
Given the expense
of rebuilding the royal fleet...

45
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:58,692
How much can the crown afford?

46
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,110
With winter coming,

47
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:03,572
half what they ask? Less?

48
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:06,533
You're the master of coin.
How do we pay them?

49
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:11,162
Well, house Tyrell could front the gold,
and the crown would pay us back in time,

50
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:14,291
or I'd have words with my daughter.

51
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:21,548
You've already given us too much.

52
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:25,844
No, we must arrange better terms
with the iron bank.

53
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,304
- Absolutely.
- In person.

54
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,976
We must send an envoy to the iron bank,

55
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:36,646
someone of importance
to show these bankers our respect.

56
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,691
As the king's master of coin,
I can think of no one more qualified.

57
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,484
I would be honored, your grace.

58
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:45,572
The king's expressed concern about
his father-in-law's safety on this voyage.

59
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:53,079
He's ordered ser meryn
to personally lead your escort.

60
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:57,626
My very own kingsguard?
Please express my...

61
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:59,169
Safe travels, lord Tyrell.

62
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,171
Of course. Of course.

63
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:05,550
I'll give your regards to the
titan of braavos.

64
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:17,187
The small council
grows smaller and smaller.

65
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,980
Not small enough.

66
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:32,285
Cersei: May I offer you some wine?

67
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,877
The old high septon
would have asked the vintage.

68
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:44,130
I could say that our minds
are temples to the seven,

69
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:46,508
and should be kept pure.

70
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:49,719
But the truth is, I don't like the taste.

71
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,221
Hmm.

72
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,224
How may I serve?

73
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,145
All over Westeros
we hear of septs being burned,

74
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:01,064
silent sisters raped,

75
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,401
the bodies of holy
men piled in the streets.

76
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:08,571
Wars teach people to obey the sword,
not the gods.

77
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,907
Perhaps the gods need a sword of their own.

78
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,618
In the days before the targaryens,

79
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:17,038
the faith militant dispensed
the justice of the seven.

80
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:21,668
Well, the faith militant was disarmed
more than two centuries ago.

81
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:25,171
If I explain their holy purpose
to my son, the king,

82
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:29,426
I have no doubt he will sign a decree
arming the believers you felt worthy.

83
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:34,014
An army that defends
the bodies and souls of the common people?

84
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:36,516
An army in service to the gods themselves.

85
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,643
And to you, of course,

86
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,312
as the chosen representative of the seven.

87
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:44,065
An honor I never expected.

88
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:45,942
Or ever wished for.

89
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,569
Which is why you were chosen.

90
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,448
You and I both know how the world works.

91
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:56,202
Too often, the wicked are the wealthiest,
beyond the reach of justice.

92
00:08:56,286 --> 00:09:00,040
The king himself cannot always
punish those who deserve it most.

93
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:03,001
All sinners are equal before the gods.

94
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:11,885
What would you say if I told you
of a great sinner in our very midst?

95
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,804
Shielded by gold and privilege.

96
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,476
May the fatherjudge him justly.

97
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:54,177
What are you doing?

98
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,891
Help me! Help me!

99
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:09,609
Yeah. Yeah.

100
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,195
Get off me!

101
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:19,536
Come on.

102
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:22,372
Shut up! Move!

103
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,841
This is lord petyr baelish's establishment.

104
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:46,312
Faith militant: Cocksuckers.

105
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,065
Boy fucker.

106
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,693
You buggering filth!

107
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:55,864
There's a special place
in the seventh hell for your kind.

108
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:58,575
Man: Please. Please, I'll pay.

109
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:00,535
I'll pay all of you.

110
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:02,537
Yes, you will.

111
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,115
Seize him.

112
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,284
Sinner.

113
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:42,761
Loras: Get your hands off me.

114
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:46,164
Ser loras of house Tyrell,
you have broken the laws of gods and men.

115
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,000
Who do you think you are?

116
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:51,461
Jusfice.

117
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,887
Why is my brother in a cell?

118
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:01,971
I don't know.

119
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:05,183
I didn't order it.

120
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:06,434
We both know who did.

121
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:11,064
You told me
she was returning to casterly rock.

122
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,900
Are you saying my mother's behind this?

123
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:16,027
She's jealous you're not hers anymore.

124
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:19,364
Arresting my brother is her revenge.

125
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,449
Aren't you and mother getting along?

126
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:31,042
Oh, my sweet, sweet king.

127
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:35,838
Do you have any affection for me at all?

128
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:38,716
Of course I do.

129
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,219
You're my queen.

130
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:46,349
I can't bear to think of my brother
locked away in some grimy cell.

131
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:50,770
I'll set him free for you.

132
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,230
Do you promise?

133
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,739
I demand that ser loras be freed now.

134
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,449
Did I arrest him?

135
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,036
Well, no.

136
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,998
But you armed the faith militant.

137
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:13,084
You gave the high sparrow an army.

138
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,377
I did.

139
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:18,006
And your wife has every right to criticize.

140
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:22,593
We can't allow fanatics
to arrest the queen's brother,

141
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:24,512
no matter his perversions.

142
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:26,806
Then,

143
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:31,311
can I tell margaery
you'll have ser loras released?

144
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:33,896
I told you, I'm not holding ser loras.

145
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:35,982
You're the king.

146
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:40,028
I'm sure if you speak to the high sparrow,
he'll release the poor boy.

147
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:46,451
Halt!

148
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,810
His holiness is praying.
He will not be disturbed.

149
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,148
Give the order, and
we'll clear out this rabble.

150
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:21,527
You mean kill them?

151
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:24,030
Here, at the sept?

152
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:26,275
You'd be sending them
to meet the gods that they love.

153
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,163
Man 1: Bastard!

154
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,407
Man 2: You're an abomination!

155
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:41,547
Man 3: Born of sin!

156
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,883
Woman: Filthy bastard!

157
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,556
We'll find another way.

158
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:54,644
Man 4: Abomination!

159
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:01,984
My queen?

160
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:09,826
There was no way
to free ser loras without violence.

161
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:15,957
You're the king of the andals,

162
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,669
the lord of the seven kingdoms,
the protector of the realm,

163
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,880
and you let a band of fanatics
imprison your brother-by-law.

164
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,151
I'm going to speak with the high sparrow.

165
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,927
Are you? When?

166
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,180
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

167
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,559
He was praying just now.

168
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:39,397
I have to send word to grandmother.

169
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,233
Will you come back later?

170
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:47,029
I need to be with my family, your grace.

171
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:50,116
Of course.

172
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,871
Selyse: You think highly of this boy?

173
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:56,414
Good.

174
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,183
Stannis: Lord commander
of the night's watch.

175
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,169
And a bastard by some tavern slut.

176
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:04,046
Perhaps, but that wasn't ned stark's way.

177
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:09,886
I should have given you a son.

178
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:13,347
Not your fault.

179
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:14,891
Whose, then?

180
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,977
I gave you nothing but weakness

181
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,148
and deformity.

182
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:26,319
Those scars mean nothing
to the lord of light.

183
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,862
My lady.

184
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:31,073
Her father is the lord's chosen king,

185
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:33,659
and her father's blood
runs through her veins.

186
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,171
You march on winterfell soon?

187
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:48,508
We must to beat the snows.

188
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:54,263
Once before, you put your faith
in ser davos and left me behind.

189
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:58,851
I hope you won't make that mistake again.

190
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:00,102
I won't.

191
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:04,774
I need you.

192
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,235
You only need faith, my king.

193
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:13,616
And you. What do you need?

194
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:17,370
To serve my lord.

195
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,709
Lord ashford.

196
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,592
Lady caulfield.

197
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,930
Lord smallwood.

198
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:38,116
I've never even heard of these people.

199
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,017
They haven't heard of you, either.

200
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:43,020
But we need men, and they have some.

201
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:48,401
How many men does this lord mayzen
have to send us?

202
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,861
More than lord wibberley.

203
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:06,502
- Not him.
- I know. I'm sorry.

204
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,254
But we need men and supplies,

205
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:10,482
and roose Bolton's the warden of the north.

206
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:11,632
He murdered my brother.

207
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:14,510
We swore to be the watchers on the wall.

208
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,013
We can't watch the wall with 50 men.

209
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:22,602
And we can't get more men
without help from the warden of the north.

210
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,710
Apologies, my lady.

211
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,390
Lord commander.

212
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,185
How can I help you?

213
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,354
Come with us when we ride south.

214
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:09,398
None of us know the
castle as well as you do.

215
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:13,069
Its hidden tunnels, its
weaknesses, its people.

216
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:16,822
Winterfell was your home once.

217
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:20,785
Don't you want to chase the rats out of it?

218
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:26,040
Castle black is my home now.

219
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:29,543
The night's watch take no part
in the wars of the seven kingdoms.

220
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:31,087
There's only one war.

221
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:33,673
Life against death.

222
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:39,011
Come, let me show you
what you're fighting for.

223
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:41,097
You're gonna show me
some vision in the fire?

224
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:45,434
Forgive me. I don't trust in visions.

225
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:49,105
No visions. No magic.

226
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:51,774
Just life.

227
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:14,422
Do you feel my heart beating?

228
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:19,009
There's power in you.

229
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:22,930
You resist it, and that's your mistake.
Embrace it.

230
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:36,861
The lord of light made us male and female.

231
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,072
Two parts of a greater whole.

232
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:43,701
In ourjoining, there's power.

233
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:47,621
Power to make life,

234
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:50,249
power to make light,

235
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,334
and power to cast shadows.

236
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:56,046
I don't think Stannis
would like that very much.

237
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:58,507
Then we shouldn't tell him.

238
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:02,762
- I can't.
- Why?

239
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:04,680
I swore a vow.

240
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,393
I loved another.

241
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:12,146
The dead don't need lovers.

242
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:13,355
Only the living.

243
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:20,279
I know.

244
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:23,407
But I still love her.

245
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,591
You know nothing, Jon snow.

246
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,463
Are you lonely?

247
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:22,508
Just bored.

248
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:26,011
My father used to tell me that boredom
indicates a lack of inner resources.

249
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,763
Were you bored a lot, too?

250
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:31,892
I know castle black
is no place for a child, but...

251
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:34,603
I like it. I thought I'd be left at home.

252
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,439
I know mother didn't want to bring me.

253
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:39,733
Why do you say that?

254
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,737
She told me, "I don't want to bring you."

255
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:47,283
She shouldn't have said that.

256
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,295
Are you ashamed of me, father?

257
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:12,141
When you were an infant,

258
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:16,145
a dornish trader landed on dragonstone.

259
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:20,316
His goods were junk
except for one wooden doll.

260
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:25,112
He had even sewn a dress on it
in the colors of our house.

261
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:32,828
No doubt he'd heard of your birth
and assumed new fathers were easy targets.

262
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:39,335
I still remember how you smiled
when I put that do” in your cradle.

263
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,796
How you pressed it to your cheek.

264
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,640
By the time we burned
the do”, it was too late.

265
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:57,645
I was told you would die.

266
00:23:58,479 --> 00:23:59,813
Or worse,

267
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:02,816
the greyscale would go slow.

268
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:08,030
Let you growjust enough to know the world
before taking it away from you.

269
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,699
Everyone advised me to send you
to the ruins of valyria

270
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:12,952
to live out your short
life with the stone men,

271
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:15,871
before the sickness
spread through the castle.

272
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,458
I told them all to go to hell.

273
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:24,421
I called in every maester
on this side of the world.

274
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:27,549
Every healer. Every apothecary.

275
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:31,762
They stopped the
disease and saved your life.

276
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:36,350
Because you do not belong across the world
with the bloody stone men.

277
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:40,396
You are the Princess shireen
of house Baratheon.

278
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:45,025
And you are my daughter.

279
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,428
Littlefinger:
I thought I might find you here.

280
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,260
Your aunt lyanna.

281
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:56,221
Father never talked about her,

282
00:25:57,765 --> 00:26:00,601
but sometimes I'd find him down here
lighting the candles.

283
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:03,854
They say she was beautiful.

284
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:06,190
I saw her once.

285
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:09,443
I was a boy living with
your mother's family.

286
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:12,488
Lord whent held a great
tourney at harrenhal.

287
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,324
Everyone was there.

288
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:18,535
The mad king, your father,

289
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:20,204
Robert Baratheon,

290
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:22,331
and lyanna.

291
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,625
She was already promised to Robert.

292
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:30,506
You can imagine what it was like for me, a
boy from nowhere with nothing to his name,

293
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:34,218
watching these legendary men
tilting at the lists.

294
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:40,099
The last two riders were barristan selmy
and rhaegar Targaryen.

295
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:43,852
When rhaegar won,
everyone cheered for their prince.

296
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:45,914
I remember the girls laughing
when he took off his helmet,

297
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:48,107
and they saw that silver hair.

298
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:49,358
How handsome he was.

299
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:53,278
Until he rode right past his wife,

300
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:57,116
elia martell, and all the smiles died.

301
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,702
I've never seen so many people so quiet.

302
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:03,914
He rode past his wife,

303
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:09,294
and he lay a crown of winter roses
in lyanna's lap.

304
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:10,879
Blue as frost.

305
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:18,887
How many tens of thousands had to die
because rhaegar chose your aunt?

306
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:23,559
Yes, he chose her.

307
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:26,812
And then he kidnapped her and raped her.

308
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,488
Come.

309
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:39,658
Let's speak somewhere
the dead can't hear us.

310
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,123
You're dressed for riding.

311
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:47,207
I am.

312
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:50,711
Where are you going?

313
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:52,838
King's landing.

314
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:54,464
King's landing?

315
00:27:54,548 --> 00:27:56,633
Cersei sent for me.

316
00:27:56,717 --> 00:27:59,094
We mustn't let her sniff out any trouble.

317
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:00,971
You can't leave me here.

318
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,300
I know how hard it is
to live with people you despise.

319
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,391
Believe me.

320
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:06,393
But it won't be for long.

321
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:08,312
How do you know?

322
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:13,358
Stannis Baratheon
garrisons at castle black.

323
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:17,571
He'll march south to king's landing
before the winter snows block his way.

324
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:21,033
But first, he has to take winterfell.

325
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:23,452
- You don't know that.
- I do.

326
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,538
Once he liberates these lands
from the boltons,

327
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:29,124
he'll rally your father's bannermen
to his cause.

328
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:33,712
With the north behind him,
Stannis can finally take the iron throne.

329
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:35,714
You think he'll defeat the boltons?

330
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:38,175
He has a larger army.

331
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:40,886
He's the finest military commander
in Westeros.

332
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:44,723
A betting man would
put his money on Stannis.

333
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:47,226
I am a betting man.

334
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:50,187
And if you're right?

335
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,272
Stannis takes winterfell,

336
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:55,484
he rescues you from
the most despised family in the north.

337
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:58,528
Grateful for your late father's
courageous support of his claim,

338
00:28:58,612 --> 00:29:01,031
he names you wardeness of the north.

339
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,450
But I...

340
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:05,202
I wouldn't...

341
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:06,662
Wardeness of the north?

342
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,956
You are the last surviving stark.

343
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:10,457
He needs you.

344
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:14,378
And what if you're wrong?
What if Stannis never attacks winterfell?

345
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:17,130
Or he does, and the boltons defeat him?

346
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:20,717
Then you will take this Bolton boy, ramsay,
and make him yours.

347
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:22,928
I don't know how to do that.

348
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:24,763
Of course you do.

349
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:26,598
He's already fallen for you.

350
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,767
His father frightens me.

351
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,394
He should. He's a dangerous man.

352
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:35,524
But even the most dangerous men
can be outmaneuvered.

353
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:38,485
And you've learned to maneuver
from the very best.

354
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:43,448
I'll return before too long.

355
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:45,325
You be strong without me.

356
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,211
The north will be yours.

357
00:29:57,546 --> 00:29:58,922
Do you believe me?

358
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:05,095
I expect I'll be a married woman
by the time you return.

359
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:09,993
Breakfast.

360
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:16,124
That would have been a shit way to die.

361
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:19,544
As far as I've seen,
they're all shit ways to die.

362
00:31:19,628 --> 00:31:22,714
Aye, but your lot have
to give the singers a good ending.

363
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:25,634
I don't care
what's sung about me when I'm dead.

364
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:32,057
Two knights off to rescue a Princess.
Sounds like a good song to me.

365
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,517
Sounds like all the rest.

366
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:39,314
What about you?

367
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:41,650
What shit way would you choose?

368
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:48,031
In my own keep, drinking my own wine,
watching my sons grovel for my fortune.

369
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:51,743
How disappointing.

370
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:54,788
I thought you'd have
something more exciting planned.

371
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:59,167
I've had an exciting life.
I want my death to be boring.

372
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,754
How do you want to go?

373
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:05,257
In the arms of the woman I love.

374
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:10,011
She want the same thing?

375
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:17,686
Let's go.

376
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:31,241
The captain of that ship,
what was he, braavosi?

377
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:33,034
Jaime: Pentoshi.

378
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:34,661
Bronn: And he's headed to oldtown?

379
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:36,705
Jaime: As I said. Why?

380
00:32:37,414 --> 00:32:39,458
What's to stop him
from docking down the coast,

381
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:42,169
and telling the locals
that Jaime Lannister is in dorne?

382
00:32:42,252 --> 00:32:43,712
A bag of gold.

383
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:46,047
I'm not sure you understand

384
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:48,675
how much people hate your family
in this part of the world.

385
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:50,594
It was a heavy bag.

386
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:53,472
And I bet he swore all
kinds of oaths to get it.

387
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:55,682
But you won't be around if he breaks 'em.

388
00:33:05,442 --> 00:33:07,611
Bronn: How many you count?
Jaime: Four.

389
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:09,821
How many do you think you can take?

390
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:11,907
One, if he's slow.

391
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:17,162
Halt!

392
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:19,331
Over the hill.

393
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:23,502
Fucked in the ass.

394
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:28,965
Hyah!

395
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:34,346
Bronn: Morning, lads.

396
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:36,640
Glad we found you.

397
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:39,100
Who are you?

398
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:42,979
Cooper. This is Darnell.

399
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,689
You're from king's landing.

400
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:46,483
Accent gave me away?

401
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:50,362
Flea bottom, whelped and whipped.

402
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:51,488
Why are you here?

403
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:55,116
Our ship capsized in the night.
We managed to swim ashore.

404
00:33:55,951 --> 00:33:58,119
It was a near thing, really.

405
00:33:58,245 --> 00:34:00,413
Thought the sharks would get us.

406
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:03,375
There are no sharks in dorne.

407
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,295
Could have sworn those were shark fins.

408
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:10,090
Dolphins, maybe.

409
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:13,176
Throw your swords in the sand.

410
00:34:13,635 --> 00:34:15,971
Boys, there's no need for this.

411
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:20,100
Just point us in the right direction,
we'll find our way home.

412
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:22,352
Swords in the sand now.

413
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:43,873
Hyah! Hyah!

414
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:52,215
That one should be slow enough.

415
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:47,687
Bronn: Nice move.

416
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:50,857
Luck.

417
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:53,568
You had a wonderful teacher.

418
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:10,168
Always wanted a dornish stallion.

419
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:13,838
Beasts can run a day
and night without tiring.

420
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:17,008
We'll ride to the water gardens
with a nice breeze in our faces.

421
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:18,551
First we need to Bury these bodies.

422
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:21,137
Birds have to eat, too.

423
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:23,515
Corpses raise questions.
Questions raise armies.

424
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,475
We're not here to start a war.

425
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,937
Do you know how long it'll take us
to dig all those holes?

426
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:32,357
I can't dig very well with one hand.

427
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,401
Not at all, really.

428
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:05,974
Mama.

429
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:13,898
Nym, obara.

430
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:15,942
Will it be war?

431
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:18,570
Prince doran will weep for your father,
but nothing else.

432
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:21,114
We must avenge oberyn ourselves.

433
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:24,325
Without doran, we have no army
to march against the lannisters.

434
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:27,162
We don't need an army to start a war.

435
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:30,832
Queen Cersei loves her children,

436
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:32,834
and we have one of them.

437
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:34,711
You may have a problem.

438
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:43,261
A ship's captain
who found me in planky town

439
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:45,054
claiming he had information to sell.

440
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:48,933
He told me he smuggled
Jaime Lannister into dorne.

441
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,437
He's come for myrcella.

442
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:58,109
If he gets to her before we do,
we lose our only chance for revenge.

443
00:37:58,485 --> 00:38:00,028
You must choose.

444
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:03,448
Doran's way and peace,

445
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:06,326
or my way and war.

446
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:11,206
I'm with you always.

447
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,297
Obara?

448
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:24,302
When I was a child,
oberyn came to take me to court.

449
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:28,264
I had never seen this man,
and yet he called himself my father.

450
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:32,977
My mother wept, said I was too young
and a girl.

451
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:38,608
Oberyn tossed his
spear at my feet and said,

452
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:41,528
"girl or boy, we fight our battles,

453
00:38:41,611 --> 00:38:44,739
"but the gods let us choose our weapons."

454
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:49,410
My father pointed to the spear,
and then to my mother's tears.

455
00:38:57,252 --> 00:38:59,420
I made my choice long ago.

456
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:04,717
Tyrion: Will you untie me?

457
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:07,929
Will you please untie me?

458
00:39:08,638 --> 00:39:09,931
Will you please?

459
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:34,581
Thank you.

460
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:43,882
Who are you?

461
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:45,967
Your captor.

462
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:50,221
Do you have wine?

463
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:54,058
Can't sleep without wine.

464
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,643
Then stay awake.

465
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,818
You're going the wrong way.

466
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:10,158
My sister is in Westeros. Westeros is west.

467
00:40:10,283 --> 00:40:11,951
We're heading east.

468
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:14,245
I'm not taking you to your sister.

469
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,082
You said you were taking me to the queen.

470
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:22,921
I am. Queen Daenerys Targaryen.
She's the queen I serve.

471
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:32,513
What a waste of a good kidnapping.

472
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:35,016
It so happens I was heading there myself.

473
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:37,852
What business would you have
with the queen?

474
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:40,396
Gold and glory. Oh, and hate.

475
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:44,192
If you'd ever met my
sister, you'd understand.

476
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:48,571
So now that it's clear
we are on the same side...

477
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:04,379
A highborn knight from the north of
Westeros down on his luck in essos.

478
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:07,715
Dragon epaulets, bear sigil breastplate.

479
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:11,469
You're jorah mormont.

480
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:14,681
I have to ask.

481
00:41:14,764 --> 00:41:19,268
How exactly were you serving your queen
in a whorehouse half a world away?

482
00:41:19,936 --> 00:41:22,313
Is it possible that you were running?

483
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:27,110
Why would you be running?
And why would she have sent you away?

484
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,195
Oh, wait.

485
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:32,907
You were spying on her, weren't you?

486
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:35,660
It's all coming back to me.

487
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,763
I was drunk through
most of the small council meetings,

488
00:41:37,787 --> 00:41:39,539
but it's all coming back.

489
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:42,750
You passed notes to varys' little birds.

490
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,963
She found out, didn't she?

491
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:49,298
Found out and exiled you.

492
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:53,678
Now you hope to
win back her favor with a gift.

493
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,597
Risky scheme.

494
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:00,018
One might even say desperate.

495
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:04,856
You think Daenerys will execute me
and pardon you?

496
00:42:06,274 --> 00:42:08,776
I'd say the reverse is just as likely.

497
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:33,134
Everyone looks happy enough from up here.

498
00:42:34,177 --> 00:42:35,636
What?

499
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:38,723
I was thinking about
all the times your brother

500
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:42,226
made me go with him down from the red keep
into the streets of king's landing.

501
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:45,146
- Why?
- He liked to walk among the people.

502
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:46,814
He liked to sing to them.

503
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:48,775
He sang to them?

504
00:42:48,858 --> 00:42:50,526
Yes.

505
00:42:51,152 --> 00:42:56,532
Rhaegar would pick a spot on the hook,
or the street of seeds, and then he'd sing.

506
00:42:56,616 --> 00:42:57,968
Just like all the other minstrels.

507
00:42:57,992 --> 00:42:59,160
And what did you do?

508
00:42:59,494 --> 00:43:00,995
I made sure no one killed him.

509
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:04,332
And I collected the money.

510
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:06,417
What? He liked to see
how much he could make.

511
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:08,461
- He was good?
- He was very good.

512
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:09,796
Viserys never told you?

513
00:43:09,879 --> 00:43:12,381
He told me rhaegar
was good at killing people.

514
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:16,260
Rhaegar never liked
killing. He loved singing.

515
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:18,328
And what did you do with the money?

516
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:21,682
Well, one time, he gave it
to the next minstrel down the street.

517
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:24,227
One time, he gave it
to an orphanage in flea bottom.

518
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:28,022
One time, we got horribly drunk.

519
00:43:29,524 --> 00:43:30,566
Daario: Your grace.

520
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:35,696
Hizdahr is here,
waiting in the audience chamber.

521
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:37,615
How many others are there?

522
00:43:38,366 --> 00:43:39,784
Fifty? 100?

523
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:42,578
Will you be joining us?

524
00:43:42,662 --> 00:43:46,374
I think I can protect you
from hizdahr zo loraq.

525
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:48,876
I think I can protect me
from hizdahr zo loraq.

526
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:53,047
Go, ser barristan. Sing a song for me.

527
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:55,383
Your grace.

528
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:03,808
All men must die, but
not all can die in glory.

529
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:05,935
- Glory?
- Why else do men fight?

530
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:09,730
Why did your ancestors cross the narrow sea
and conquer the seven kingdoms?

531
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:12,316
So their names would live on.

532
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,236
Those who find victory in the fighting pits
will never become kings,

533
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:17,363
but their names will live on.

534
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:19,282
It's the best chance they'll ever have.

535
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:20,825
Is that what you used to tell men

536
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:23,786
before you set them
to butchering each other for sport?

537
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:26,664
Today is the traditional start
of the fighting season.

538
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:28,499
I do not recognize this tradition.

539
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:31,669
Traditions are the only thing
that will hold this city,

540
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:33,212
your city, together.

541
00:44:35,423 --> 00:44:38,801
Without them, former slaves and
former masters have nothing in common.

542
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:44,098
Nothing but centuries
of mistrust and resentment.

543
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:48,811
I can't promise
this is the answer to all our problems,

544
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:50,938
but it's a start.

545
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:29,393
Sons of the harpy.
