1
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:08,741
(French accent) Jackie.

2
00:00:08,743 --> 00:00:11,076
Amber, it is good
to see you again.

3
00:00:11,078 --> 00:00:12,878
I'm so pleased you could come.

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,247
The painting
is right through here.

5
00:00:16,483 --> 00:00:18,884
It is not listed in
our official inventory.

6
00:00:18,886 --> 00:00:22,121
It might be quite valuable,
if it is authentic.

7
00:00:22,123 --> 00:00:23,989
That is what I am here for.

8
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:29,828
Northern song dynasty,
11th century,

9
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:33,132
ink and pale color on silk.
It's beautiful.

10
00:00:33,134 --> 00:00:35,701
An authentic
Chinese masterpiece.

11
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:37,870
<i>C'est formidable.</i>

12
00:00:37,872 --> 00:00:41,206
One moment while I fetch
the authentication forms.

13
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:02,561
Hey!

14
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:04,897
Put that back.

15
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:08,434
Huh?

16
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:14,940
Yaah!

17
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:31,824
All right, Mr. fold-up man,

18
00:01:31,826 --> 00:01:33,992
thank you for showing
the painting some fresh air,

19
00:01:33,994 --> 00:01:35,861
but I will take that back now.

20
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:42,167
No!

21
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,681
Not fair.

22
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:54,006
You claim a fold-up man
stole ze painting,

23
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:55,741
slipped between the bars,

24
00:02:55,743 --> 00:02:59,278
transformed into a bird,
and flew away?

25
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,046
I'll show you.

26
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:02,981
He bend like this,
folded like that,

27
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:06,318
twisted over, then again,
then he look just like this.

28
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:09,555
Uh, but more bird-shaped.

29
00:03:09,557 --> 00:03:12,057
Monsieur chan,
I will thank you

30
00:03:12,059 --> 00:03:15,527
not to destroy my notes,
<i>s'il vous plait.</i>

31
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,796
Heh heh.

32
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,366
Hi, Jackie.

33
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:25,170
Jade, you were supposed to be
taking a tour of Paris.

34
00:03:25,172 --> 00:03:26,738
T'cha. You've obviously

35
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,907
never been on a tour bus
with uncle.

36
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:30,943
You drive too fast.

37
00:03:30,945 --> 00:03:32,744
How can uncle
see the sights?

38
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:34,479
Slow down.

39
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:36,481
I told him I was
having lunch with you.

40
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:37,716
He bought it.

41
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,551
What's with the look?

42
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,353
Did that painting
turn out to be bogus?

43
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:43,855
No. It was a true masterpiece.

44
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:46,992
But a fold-up man stole it,
turned into a bird,

45
00:03:46,994 --> 00:03:48,994
and flew away.

46
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,830
Fold-up man.

47
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:53,732
That is what
the police said, too.

48
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:57,402
Ah, poor Amber. She will be
in trouble with her bosses.

49
00:03:57,404 --> 00:04:00,806
I must retrieve
the painting somehow.

50
00:04:00,808 --> 00:04:02,107
Lucky you got me.

51
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:03,942
I read in
a comic book once--

52
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:06,511
to catch a thief,
- you must think like a thief.

53
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:09,414
But I am no good
at thinking like a thief.

54
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,682
Yeah, I know.

55
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:13,652
That's why I recommend
we find some expert help.

56
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:17,456
Viper!

57
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:18,890
Jade.

58
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:23,629
What's with him?

59
00:04:23,631 --> 00:04:25,631
Nothing. He's just
having a hissy

60
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:28,200
about you being
a bad influence on me
because you're a thief.

61
00:04:28,202 --> 00:04:30,168
<i>Former</i> thief.

62
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,638
Now
I'm a security consultant
for the becktul corporation.

63
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,940
And Jade tells me
you need some assistance.

64
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:36,408
No, thank you.

65
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:39,044
I have enough problems
with one criminal.

66
00:04:39,046 --> 00:04:41,713
Oh, come on, Jackie.
Viper's a good guy now.

67
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:42,814
Here, viper.

68
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:45,484
The painting stealer
left this behind.

69
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:48,153
Where did you find that?

70
00:04:48,155 --> 00:04:50,889
Ah, yes.
They call him origami.

71
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:51,957
Huh?

72
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,025
You know this guy?

73
00:04:53,027 --> 00:04:55,193
I've heard only a rumor
of a mastermind

74
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:57,429
who leaves origami animals
at all his thefts,

75
00:04:57,431 --> 00:04:58,797
like a calling card.

76
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:01,900
And can he fold himself
into different shapes?

77
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:03,568
I've never heard that.

78
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,405
There is one person
who might know more.

79
00:05:06,407 --> 00:05:07,572
But...

80
00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:09,107
But what?

81
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:11,510
But you don't want my help.

82
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:17,382
The fox. This is
home base for every
crook in Paris.

83
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:19,584
The proprietor
is an old friend.

84
00:05:19,586 --> 00:05:22,721
Cool. A wretched hive
of scum and villainy.

85
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:24,122
Come on.
Jade...

86
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:27,726
If I let you come inside,
you must do everything I say.

87
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:31,396
First, touch nothing.
Second, see nothing.

88
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:33,332
Third, talk to--

89
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:36,935
hey!
Ooh.

90
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:39,371
Excuse me.
- Just passing through.

91
00:05:39,373 --> 00:05:43,008
Waah...My bad.
Gooh! Do not get up.

92
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,143
I am new here.

93
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:47,412
I do not like this place.

94
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:51,283
(French accent) Viper,
I heard you went legit.

95
00:05:51,285 --> 00:05:52,417
You heard right.

96
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:55,387
Listen, fox,
I need some 411.

97
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:58,023
What can you tell me
about this?

98
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:00,759
Ah, <i> oui.</i> Origami.

99
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:04,296
He only steals the finest
of far-east art.

100
00:06:04,298 --> 00:06:07,999
They say he has
magical powers.

101
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:09,568
Cool.

102
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,503
The way I heard it told,

103
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:13,839
he was just a small-timer:

104
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:16,441
Vending machines,
picking pockets,

105
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:18,310
little penny-ante heists,

106
00:06:18,312 --> 00:06:20,445
until one day,

107
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:23,648
he found an enchanted
square of paper

108
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:27,486
with the power
- to transform the paper...

109
00:06:27,488 --> 00:06:33,492
Well, let's just say
it remade him.

110
00:06:33,494 --> 00:06:37,262
Now he has some kind
of folding power,

111
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:39,364
if you believe
that sort of thing,

112
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:40,632
which I don't.

113
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:44,436
But it is true. I saw origami
with my own eyes.

114
00:06:44,438 --> 00:06:47,038
(Gasps) Did you see
his henchmen:

115
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,409
The easter bunny
- and the tooth fairy as well?

116
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:53,412
That was useless.

117
00:06:53,414 --> 00:06:55,414
I already knew
the thief could fold up.

118
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:57,549
Yeah, but now
we also know

119
00:06:57,551 --> 00:07:00,752
he only steals
- the finest far-east art.

120
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:03,155
Hey, the kid's
a good listener.

121
00:07:03,157 --> 00:07:06,625
How come you never listen
to the things I say?

122
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:09,461
For example,
stay with uncle.

123
00:07:09,463 --> 00:07:10,996
Oh, man.

124
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,935
Kuniko kasahara
of kasahara exports.

125
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:20,238
He possesses more far-east art
than the far east itself.

126
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,742
It's just a matter of time
before origami shows up
to rob the place.

127
00:07:23,744 --> 00:07:26,111
Look, we have to warn
Mr. kasahara.

128
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:28,213
Have you never
heard of a stakeout?

129
00:07:28,215 --> 00:07:30,515
That means we hide
and keep watch,

130
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:32,350
with the emphasis on hide.

131
00:07:32,352 --> 00:07:33,552
Hey!

132
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:39,024
Hello, Jade.
Glad you could make it.

133
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:47,432
May I help you?

134
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:48,900
Mr. kasahara, sir,

135
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:51,036
your art collection
is in danger.

136
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:54,706
There is a thief who,
uh, is very resourceful.

137
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,908
I would like to offer
my assistance.

138
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:59,277
Please leave my doorstep,
mister...

139
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,545
Chan. Jackie chan.

140
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:02,981
Go away, chan Jackie chan.

141
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:05,050
I will not pay
for your protection.

142
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:08,186
My protection? I'm not
trying to blackmail anyone.

143
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:10,722
Huh? Viper?

144
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:16,528
Ahh, Jade?

145
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:24,269
You are supposed
to be with uncle.

146
00:08:24,271 --> 00:08:25,470
T'cha.

147
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:27,305
You are driving too slow.

148
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:30,375
I want to see all of Paris
before I get old.

149
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:31,810
Don't have a cow.

150
00:08:31,812 --> 00:08:33,712
I told him I was
meeting you for a movie.

151
00:08:33,714 --> 00:08:36,548
Shh! Someone's coming.

152
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,884
Oh, it's just
that kasahara dude.

153
00:08:38,886 --> 00:08:42,220
Jade should
not be running around
rooftops with thieves.

154
00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:43,522
I'm not a thief.

155
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:45,790
Better she learns how to
catch bad guys from a pro.

156
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:48,727
Jade does not need to know
how to catch bad guys.

157
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:50,395
But you do.

158
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:56,902
Whoa, he's folded.
He's origam--aah.

159
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:21,459
Ah, another masterpiece
for my eyes only.

160
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:26,798
It's him.
Kasahara is origami.

161
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:42,213
That painting does not
belong to you.

162
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,687
Ah, Mr. chan Jackie chan.

163
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:50,889
Return the painting
to the university.

164
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:53,224
Why? So it can end up
in a museum?

165
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,630
Aah!

166
00:09:58,632 --> 00:10:01,166
No more games.
I know who you are.

167
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:03,168
Origami.

168
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:06,037
I'm sure we both agree
there is nothing to be
gained

169
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:08,106
by my denying it!

170
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:17,849
Jackie!
Jade, wait.

171
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:19,417
Jumping into a fight
before you're needed

172
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:21,152
usually makes things worse.

173
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:22,287
But...

174
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:34,065
Ok, now he needs help,
but you stay here.

175
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:35,834
Oh, man.

176
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,867
Ow!

177
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:11,469
Ooh. Paper cut.
That's the worst.

178
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:16,608
Both: Yaah!

179
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,510
Unh.

180
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:31,890
Jackie, swords.

181
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:38,263
Scissor beats paper.

182
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:48,073
Police. Stay where you are.

183
00:11:48,075 --> 00:11:51,309
Detective, I found
the fold-up man.
He's over here.

184
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,080
What is this madness?

185
00:11:55,082 --> 00:11:57,482
Mr. kasahara, sir,
are you all right?

186
00:11:57,484 --> 00:11:59,851
This man is crazy.
He is dangerous.

187
00:11:59,853 --> 00:12:01,352
He destroyed my gallery

188
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:04,355
and attacked me with my own
12th-century swords.

189
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,126
No! He's lying.

190
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:09,861
He changed back
to a normal man.

191
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:11,096
It's true.

192
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:14,365
Kuniko kasahara is origami,
the master thief.

193
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:17,869
Mmm, are you not
a thief yourself, huh?

194
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:20,238
La viper, I believe.

195
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,440
Uh, run.

196
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:23,875
Huh?

197
00:12:23,877 --> 00:12:25,143
(Panting)

198
00:12:25,145 --> 00:12:26,911
After them!

199
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:33,752
Jade: Well, now we
know kasahara built such
a large collection

200
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:35,053
of far-east art.

201
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:38,256
But now the police think
I am crazy and dangerous.

202
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,691
You know what we have to do.

203
00:12:39,693 --> 00:12:43,194
We have to catch origami
in the act.

204
00:12:43,196 --> 00:12:45,330
You will stay with uncle.

205
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,401
Breaking into the louvre.

206
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:53,104
I've been planning this
in my head for years.

207
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:55,707
Remember, we are here
to catch origami.

208
00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:57,375
Do not steal anything.

209
00:12:57,377 --> 00:12:59,010
Don't you trust me?

210
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:01,346
No, I do not.

211
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:13,691
Jade?!

212
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:16,194
T'cha, like a daytime
tour with uncle
was so much fun,

213
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:18,296
you thought I'd wanna
go on a nighttime one?

214
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:21,166
It is too dark
to see anything.

215
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:23,201
Is not Paris
the city of lights?

216
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:25,336
Make it brighter.

217
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:28,807
And I actually told uncle I'd
be meeting you at the louvre.

218
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:30,742
You are a bad influence.

219
00:13:30,744 --> 00:13:32,377
<i>Moi?</i>

220
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:38,983
Aha. Right where
it's supposed to be.

221
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:43,955
The ming exhibit.

222
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:46,157
Be careful. Any one
of these paintings

223
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:49,160
could be origami incognito.

224
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:56,301
There he is!
(Alarm sounds)

225
00:13:56,303 --> 00:13:58,169
What?

226
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:04,442
Whoa.

227
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,658
Bad day, bad day, bad day!

228
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:26,965
Bad day, bad day, bad day!

229
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:32,437
Hyah!

230
00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:34,939
Viper!

231
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:37,108
I knew she would
betray us.

232
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:40,945
I heard that.

233
00:14:40,947 --> 00:14:43,514
See, Jackie? I told you
viper's a good guy now.

234
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,917
Hmm...

235
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:59,898
Halt! You are all
under arrest.

236
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,299
You don't want us.

237
00:15:01,301 --> 00:15:02,767
You want the fold-up man.

238
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:04,802
Eh, <i> oui, oui,</i>
à the paper fold-up man.

239
00:15:04,804 --> 00:15:07,505
I have heard all about it
for the last time.

240
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:10,275
No, no. He is right there.

241
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:15,079
(Grunting)

242
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,655
(Gasps) A fold-up man.

243
00:15:23,657 --> 00:15:26,658
The urn is too heavy
for him to fly away.

244
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,126
<i>S'arreter!</i>

245
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:31,062
Is this one of those times

246
00:15:31,064 --> 00:15:32,864
when it's better to wait
before jumping in?

247
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:34,699
No.

248
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,875
(Tires squeal)

249
00:16:17,877 --> 00:16:20,912
Oomph. Fine.
You take the wheel.

250
00:16:20,914 --> 00:16:22,780
I'll just take this.

251
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:37,261
(Car horn honking)

252
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:44,669
Sorry, uncle.
I'll see you later.

253
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:46,070
Don't miss the louvre.
Bye-bye.

254
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:55,613
Stealing a police car.
Shame on you.

255
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:57,048
Didn't you just
steal that urn

256
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,449
from Mr. kasahara?

257
00:16:58,451 --> 00:17:00,084
That is different.

258
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:06,290
Here he comes.

259
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:12,363
Uh, I can't see anything.

260
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:18,770
Stop. The tower
is closed.

261
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:26,944
Jade?

262
00:17:26,946 --> 00:17:28,579
I'm fine.

263
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:39,857
Viper, look after Jade.
Call the police.

264
00:17:39,859 --> 00:17:42,760
Wait. Did he just ask me
to look after you?

265
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:44,996
Duh. Jackie likes you.

266
00:17:44,998 --> 00:17:47,065
How about that?

267
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:49,600
Origami, look at me.

268
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:53,771
I have a rare porcelain urn
from the kilns of jingdezhen.

269
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,487
Ohh.

270
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:20,832
Come on, come on, come on.

271
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:24,435
Aah!

272
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:28,573
Ohh.

273
00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:30,508
Waah!

274
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:40,051
Uh, wrong floor.

275
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:45,923
Well, chan Jackie chan,

276
00:18:45,925 --> 00:18:48,826
it appears you are down
to 2 options--

277
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:51,062
hand over the urn or jump.

278
00:18:51,064 --> 00:18:52,830
The police already
know the truth.

279
00:18:52,832 --> 00:18:54,866
They saw you
try to fly away.

280
00:18:54,868 --> 00:18:57,935
They will think
it was only their eyes
playing tricks on them.

281
00:18:57,937 --> 00:19:01,706
No one believes there can be
a paper fold-up man.

282
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:04,442
All right.
You win.

283
00:19:04,444 --> 00:19:06,477
Hey! Ohh!

284
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,012
(Grunts)

285
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:17,555
Ah...

286
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:22,660
<i>Merci, Jackie.</i>

287
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:25,830
Was the thief a fold-up man,
like you said?

288
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:28,299
Uh, no. My eyes
played tricks on me.

289
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:30,001
It was just
a normal thief.

290
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:34,906
Just a normal thief,
huh?

291
00:19:34,908 --> 00:19:38,576
Then I guess you really
didn't need my help.

292
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:42,780
That is right. No help.

293
00:19:42,782 --> 00:19:45,049
I understand.

294
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:51,923
Ow.

295
00:19:51,925 --> 00:19:54,058
Do you know how long
I was stuck in that bus

296
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,927
with cheese on my face?

297
00:19:55,929 --> 00:19:58,462
I said I was sorry. Ow!

298
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,847
Hey, Jackie...
Yes?

299
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:18,783
Where did you grow up?

300
00:20:18,785 --> 00:20:20,952
I grow up in Hong Kong...

301
00:20:20,954 --> 00:20:26,123
In apartment...With...

302
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,391
French embassy.

303
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:30,194
My father was a cook,
my mother a maid.

304
00:20:30,196 --> 00:20:33,264
So when I was young,
I speak perfect French.

305
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:37,001
The ambassador--
she's very good.

306
00:20:37,003 --> 00:20:39,870
She loved me
playing with her children.

307
00:20:39,872 --> 00:20:43,674
Except when I sleep,
back to behind the kitchen.
