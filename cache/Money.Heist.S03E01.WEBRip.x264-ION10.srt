1
00:00:14,541 --> 00:00:19,711
MADRID
77 DAYS UNTIL D-DAY

2
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:37,173
He's here.

3
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:40,791
Come on! Come on!
We're 15 minutes late.

4
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:41,705
Come on!

5
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:45,828
- Just a second! Only the brows.
- Please. There's no time.

6
00:00:46,833 --> 00:00:47,713
Hey!

7
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:54,035
On the stage.

8
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:33,038
For the last two and a half years,
many of you have called me a hero.

9
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:35,211
- Hero!
- So brave!

10
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:37,501
No, you are wrong, I am no hero.

11
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,210
I'm just an ordinary man
who was brave enough

12
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:44,501
to refuse to kneel
before the terrorists.

13
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:50,286
That's why...
That's why I can be here today.

14
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:52,671
My dignity remains intact.

15
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:54,918
Meanwhile, those rats...

16
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:58,498
are still hiding in their holes.

17
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:03,423
GUNA YALA ISLANDS

18
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:28,246
Some people like those kidnappers.

19
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:30,165
- No way!
- Yes, believe me.

20
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,630
They find them funny.

21
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:35,168
And I keep wondering...
is a criminal funny?

22
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:36,503
- No!
- No!

23
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:39,831
Can a terrorist be considered a hero?

24
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:41,076
No!

25
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:43,996
How about the so-called
Professor Robin Hood?

26
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:46,213
- No!
- No! Helsinki...

27
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:49,826
the beast from the Balkans,

28
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:55,496
kept me suffering for 24 hours
with an explosive to my chest.

29
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:57,503
Can he be anyone's idol?

30
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:59,038
- No!
- No!

31
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:00,375
I just hope...

32
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:05,916
he feels guilty for what he did,
every single minute of his pathetic life.

33
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:13,078
PAMPAS
ARGENTINA

34
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:36,131
I rushed the so-called Denver,

35
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:38,128
with just a pair of blunt scissors.

36
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,003
He had an M16.

37
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:43,881
Suicidal?

38
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:48,625
Maybe, but as a result,
the first hostages could escape.

39
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,708
However, in exchange,
he took what I loved most.

40
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:54,036
Mónica Gaztambide.

41
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:55,291
- Forget her!
- My lover!

42
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,790
Yes, I've also made some mistakes.

43
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:01,375
I've also been one of the unfaithful.

44
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,788
One of the selfish and despicable.

45
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:05,831
As a result...

46
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,333
I lost everything.

47
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,251
Nowadays, every single morning,

48
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:14,921
I wake up and think
of whatever happened to my son.

49
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,420
JAVA
INDONESIA

50
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,625
Move over, you idiot!

51
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:26,423
Fuck you!
And your rotten bananas!

52
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,883
I love you!

53
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:33,498
Life...

54
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:36,963
Life is lost
if you don't make your mind up

55
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,000
and you let yourself go
with the flow.

56
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:46,206
I was a hostage, but we have all
been hostages to something.

57
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:47,828
Yes!

58
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:49,166
To face that,

59
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:51,918
you need to make up your mind.

60
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,251
I make up my mind!

61
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:57,036
I face my problems!
Repeat with me!

62
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,130
I make up my mind!

63
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:01,328
I face my problems!

64
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:04,956
I make up my mind!
I face my problems!

65
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:08,961
I make up my mind!
I face my problems!

66
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:13,290
I make up my mind!
I face my problems!

67
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:15,915
GUNA YALA BEACH
PELICAN ISLAND

68
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
77 DAYS LEFT UNTIL D-DAY

69
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:28,133
My name is Tokyo.

70
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:29,626
Remember me?

71
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,376
The Caribbean.

72
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:37,665
For over two years,
my life has been a romantic movie.

73
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,380
We fish our own food.

74
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:46,875
Naked, wild...

75
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:48,746
But with some luxury.

76
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:00,166
And all of this is about
to get fucked

77
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,710
by one simple thought
that's about to enter my head.

78
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:15,328
We've been here for more
than two years.

79
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,285
Two years in paradise.

80
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:23,205
Paradise is wonderful
when your life is dull...

81
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:25,208
and full of traffic jams...

82
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:27,668
so you go there sometimes.

83
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:37,921
You need a change of scenery,
don't you?

84
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,165
And I'm not a part of the plan...

85
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:44,455
Am I?

86
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:57,665
We had a good run.

87
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:04,173
Rio...

88
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,210
I need to get out of here.

89
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:11,326
I need the hubbub.

90
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:13,665
I need people.

91
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:18,038
I need not to know
where I'll be tomorrow.

92
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:21,076
I get it.

93
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,170
I'll also leave.

94
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:28,543
An adventure will do us both good.

95
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,380
It may be for a bit,
but I can't be sure.

96
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:37,666
Best to say it's forever.

97
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:46,036
In case we want to talk.

98
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:49,706
It's a satellite phone. I bought it
on the black market with Helsinki.

99
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:51,291
- Rio...
- It's unregistered.

100
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:54,828
Turn it on every three days,
at 6:00 p.m.

101
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:57,626
If either of us needs to call,
turn it on for five minutes

102
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,418
then off again
if there's no contact.

103
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:00,955
Okay?

104
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:06,458
My number is on the back.

105
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,710
011_8876_546E_32/47
I LOVE YOU

106
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:23,746
Come on...

107
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:25,576
It's going to get dark soon.

108
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,330
Rock on.

109
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,423
Rock on.

110
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,375
I can behave like a good girl
for a while.

111
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:15,083
But little by little,
my naughty side starts to come out

112
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:17,463
and eventually, it explodes.

113
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:22,375
And when I turn into a Sputnik,

114
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,420
three days fly by.

115
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:29,825
PANAMA
74 DAYS LEFT UNTIL D-DAY

116
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:33,746
They zip by so quickly that you forget
the only important thing you have to do.

117
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:16,875
SEARCHING SATELLITE

118
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:18,788
EUROPOL
THE HAGUE

119
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:47,455
Tokyo, pick up...

120
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,461
Shit, Tokyo, turn it on.

121
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,125
Shit!

122
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:35,246
Rio's position traveled from
the Guna Yala islands in the Caribbean,

123
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:36,503
to Europol in one second.

124
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:42,208
Then from Europol to the National
Intelligence Centre in 50 seconds.

125
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:43,328
Hello?

126
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:44,826
Less than a minute later,

127
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:46,995
Prieto was awake.

128
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:49,996
- Prieto.
- Colonel.

129
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:53,173
Europol has located Aníbal Cortés
on an island in Panama.

130
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:57,078
Contact the Panamanian police now!

131
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:05,171
Mine reached them even faster.

132
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:06,173
Target is out of town.

133
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,630
The phone was secure,

134
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,210
but the Libyan seller wasn't.

135
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,000
Eagle to Fox 1, we're taking off.

136
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:15,671
Hey, Rio.

137
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:16,710
That's her.

138
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:18,751
Hey, Tokyo.

139
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:20,501
Confirmed. It's Tokyo.

140
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:21,825
Police is on the way.

141
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,245
Sorry about the delay.

142
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:31,173
How are you?

143
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:35,041
I'm here. Three days watching time pass by
on this fucking island.

144
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:36,923
Police is in Cinta Costera.

145
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:38,383
Come on, come on!

146
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:44,538
I can't take it anymore.
I can't stand the Gunas' food.

147
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:49,915
For fuck's sake, I grew up eating
pizzas, burgers, fries, sausages...

148
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,880
That's what I want.
I don't want to be with these guys!

149
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,918
You can't even make them laugh!

150
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:01,001
Police is entering
the Torrillo neighbourhood.

151
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:01,995
Come on, come on!

152
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:07,626
I wanna party with you

153
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:14,078
and dance and get wasted
until our pupils look like a raccoon's.

154
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:15,916
That's what I want, Tokyo, fuck!

155
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,415
Even if it's just a date.

156
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:22,923
So you want a date?

157
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:25,003
Of course I want a date.

158
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,423
Then pick a city.

159
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,710
And I'll be there.

160
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:28,923
Rio de Janeiro.

161
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,921
- Shit!
- What?

162
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:40,826
- Patrol boats.
- What?

163
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:41,996
Patrol boats!

164
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:47,245
Run, Tokyo! They found us.

165
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:51,876
We are about to reach the plaza.

166
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,543
Alpha team, through the alley.

167
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:21,036
Back! Surround the building!

168
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,750
A COP IS NOT A FRIEND!

169
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:38,753
Alpha team through the passage!

170
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,750
Don't stop! Come on!

171
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,878
Eagle to Fox 1,
we can't see the target.

172
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:04,168
Clear. Moving forward.

173
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,000
Cubeta,
go through the Bodegón Alley,

174
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,423
in La Corrala del Muerto.

175
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:10,421
Come on! Come on!

176
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,578
Cubeta,
she's inside the courtyard.

177
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:16,963
We are surrounding her.

178
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:19,208
I got you, bitch!

179
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:20,631
Bravo 2 in position.

180
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:22,496
Bravo 1 in position.

181
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,750
- Ready.
- Go, go!

182
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,668
- Lower your guns!
- Lower your guns!

183
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,830
Easy. Lower your guns.

184
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:53,826
Negative. It's not her.

185
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:55,825
- Shit.
- Fuck.

186
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:56,788
Bitch.

187
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:24,826
That way!

188
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:28,960
Go, go, go!

189
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:36,043
Come on, go!

190
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:38,825
Guilty.

191
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:43,035
Guilty.

192
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:48,288
That's how I felt

193
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:51,536
while thinking about
every happy moment.

194
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:52,875
I had shared with Rio...

195
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:58,875
since we got free.

196
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,750
EDGE OF PORTUGAL'S TERRITORIAL WATERS
THREE YEARS LEFT UNTIL D-DAY

197
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:21,538
Ladies and gentlemen,

198
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:24,916
200 nautical miles.

199
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:30,963
We just made it
into international waters.

200
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35,916
There you go!

201
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:37,916
Hell yeah!

202
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,250
We're rich!

203
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:44,173
Rich!

204
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:46,496
Professor!

205
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:50,748
Come on!

206
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:53,915
Rich!

207
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:07,626
Finish the champagne.
We need new guidelines.

208
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:08,708
Professor...

209
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:10,246
Come on.

210
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:14,875
We have 10 million now.
Do you think we're going back to school?

211
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:19,881
We've managed to escape,
but now comes the most difficult part.

212
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:24,878
Staying alive.

213
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,170
Don't open them yet,
wait until you're on your own.

214
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:31,248
- What's this?
- Safe houses. Every couple has one.

215
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,213
So you and Helsinki
will stick together?

216
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:38,876
Of course.

217
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:39,788
Great.

218
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:42,625
You'll be under protection
and surveillance.

219
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:44,788
So, Interpol's reach will be
very weak.

220
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:47,495
- Not now, Denver.
- I didn't do anything.

221
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:51,206
Open them
when you're on your own.

222
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:56,673
I'm the only one who should know
your whereabouts at any given moment.

223
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,750
What are those numbers for?

224
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:05,246
Each number belongs to a continent.

225
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:10,043
A continent on which
you might find yourself in need of help.

226
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:11,825
Commit them to memory.

227
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,500
Now.

228
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:23,326
COLOMBIA
72 DAYS LEFT UNTIL D-DAY

229
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:50,083
These are phone numbers.

230
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:54,246
In an emergency, call the number
that corresponds with your location

231
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:57,133
to speak with your handler.

232
00:20:57,208 --> 00:21:00,578
The handlers are sleeper cells
that will bring you to me

233
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,750
safely.

234
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:03,793
Hello?

235
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:05,633
My name is Tokyo,

236
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,670
and I'm looking for my handler.

237
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:16,958
Not joining them?

238
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:18,955
In a moment.

239
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:28,166
What about you?

240
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:30,880
What about me?

241
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:33,998
Where are you going?

242
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:43,165
I hope you won't ever need
to find out, Miss Tokyo.

243
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:57,038
But that day came.

244
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:02,036
THAILAND
62 DAYS UNTIL D-DAY

245
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:04,495
I imagine the same happens
in every paradise.

246
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:06,881
In the end,
someone bites the apple

247
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:09,131
and everything goes to shit.

248
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:10,543
Let's go.

249
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:38,325
Go in.
They'll come for you.

250
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:08,035
It took me 11 days to reach the temple
where my handler left me.

251
00:23:08,666 --> 00:23:12,706
After an oil tanker, two cargo planes
and who knows how many buses...

252
00:23:12,916 --> 00:23:13,876
Miss Tokyo.

253
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:16,035
My guardian angel appeared.

254
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,130
Welcome to Thailand.

255
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:31,423
Hello.

256
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:35,001
I don't think I've ever been so happy
to see somebody.

257
00:24:01,666 --> 00:24:02,706
Professor...

258
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:06,248
Have you heard from Rio?

259
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:35,293
Mom!

260
00:24:35,916 --> 00:24:36,786
Mom!

261
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:38,495
PALAWAN
62 DAYS LEFT UNTIL D-DAY

262
00:24:38,583 --> 00:24:41,423
Mom! Mom, are you okay?

263
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,580
Are you okay?

264
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,460
Are you cold?

265
00:24:48,208 --> 00:24:50,498
Let's get out of the water.

266
00:24:52,333 --> 00:24:53,503
Come on.

267
00:24:54,041 --> 00:24:55,331
Yes, yes...

268
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:02,165
What happened, Mom?

269
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,460
It's okay, darling.
Grandma was just...

270
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:10,500
My mom was fully dressed
in the water again.

271
00:25:10,583 --> 00:25:12,213
The water felt so good...

272
00:25:13,875 --> 00:25:14,825
Raquel.

273
00:25:17,166 --> 00:25:18,916
How did your trip go, darling?

274
00:25:22,541 --> 00:25:23,711
Pack your bags.

275
00:25:24,666 --> 00:25:25,626
What's going on?

276
00:25:28,083 --> 00:25:28,923
Tokyo's here.

277
00:25:30,583 --> 00:25:32,083
Raquel, Raquel...

278
00:25:32,666 --> 00:25:34,456
Until we know for sure
what's happened,

279
00:25:34,541 --> 00:25:37,131
you must take your mother
and your daughter to Mindanao.

280
00:25:38,791 --> 00:25:41,711
And even though this place isn't safe,
you're going to stay.

281
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:43,631
It's for the best.

282
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,918
Because you have to fix a problem
for Tokyo.

283
00:25:48,708 --> 00:25:49,878
On your own.

284
00:26:07,416 --> 00:26:09,876
If you are thinking of hiding me
so she won't see me,

285
00:26:09,958 --> 00:26:11,628
you'd better think again.

286
00:26:38,625 --> 00:26:41,125
- What's that bitch doing here?
- Calm down. She's one of us now.

287
00:26:41,208 --> 00:26:42,918
Put it this way.
I changed sides.

288
00:26:44,291 --> 00:26:45,961
You know who changes sides
during a war?

289
00:26:46,041 --> 00:26:47,751
- Traitors.
- Tokyo...

290
00:26:47,833 --> 00:26:49,503
- The lowest of the low.
- Tokyo!

291
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,790
You know what happens
with those rats?

292
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:55,040
They can change sides
once, twice,

293
00:26:55,541 --> 00:26:56,881
a hundred million times.

294
00:26:56,958 --> 00:26:58,958
- Tokyo, please...
- She'll betray you!

295
00:26:59,958 --> 00:27:01,828
She'll betray you
as she betrayed them.

296
00:27:01,916 --> 00:27:03,206
- That won't happen.
- Why not?

297
00:27:03,916 --> 00:27:05,246
How can you know? Tell me!

298
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:06,253
- I know.
- Really?

299
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:08,713
- And I'm absolutely sure.
- Sure?

300
00:27:08,791 --> 00:27:09,671
Down in your pants?

301
00:27:12,583 --> 00:27:15,423
If the Professor tells you I'm one of you,
then I'm one of you.

302
00:27:16,125 --> 00:27:16,955
Is that clear?

303
00:27:17,583 --> 00:27:19,173
Nice smack you delivered.

304
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,130
We're not going to get along like that,
Inspector

305
00:27:26,625 --> 00:27:27,495
Lisbon.

306
00:27:28,166 --> 00:27:29,576
My name is Lisbon.

307
00:27:33,833 --> 00:27:37,713
Well, after this touching reunion,

308
00:27:37,791 --> 00:27:39,831
let's go have some tea.

309
00:27:42,666 --> 00:27:43,576
Please.

310
00:27:48,916 --> 00:27:49,876
- Hands up!
- Get down!

311
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,130
I told you to get down!

312
00:27:51,208 --> 00:27:53,578
Hands behind your back!

313
00:27:53,666 --> 00:27:54,876
Don't move!

314
00:27:58,625 --> 00:27:59,915
How long ago was that?

315
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,380
Eleven days.

316
00:28:03,833 --> 00:28:05,833
Where did you get
the satellite phones?

317
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:09,170
When we split into two ships,

318
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:11,290
we were in port in Casablanca
for 24 hours.

319
00:28:12,666 --> 00:28:14,286
He bought them
on the black market.

320
00:28:15,708 --> 00:28:16,708
From a Libyan.

321
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,540
In Casablanca...

322
00:28:19,625 --> 00:28:20,825
They were unregistered.

323
00:28:20,916 --> 00:28:22,496
Of course they were.

324
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:24,035
Not only that...

325
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:26,833
The vendor sold us out

326
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,380
for the reward money.

327
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,130
Professor...

328
00:28:33,541 --> 00:28:35,751
Are you completely sure
Rio's been caught?

329
00:28:37,041 --> 00:28:39,751
He'd have rung his handler like you.
Don't you think?

330
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:41,793
But nothing's been published.

331
00:28:43,916 --> 00:28:45,326
He was arrested 11 days ago.

332
00:28:46,125 --> 00:28:48,245
It's the best news
the government can announce.

333
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:52,330
Why would they keep it secret?
It's a bombshell.

334
00:29:02,583 --> 00:29:04,753
How long can they keep him hidden?

335
00:29:05,875 --> 00:29:07,325
Seventy-two hours.

336
00:29:09,583 --> 00:29:10,713
Where's he being held?

337
00:29:14,291 --> 00:29:15,381
They're not torturing him, are they?

338
00:29:16,583 --> 00:29:18,293
I don't know, Tokyo.
I don't know.

339
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:21,918
Of course he's being tortured.

340
00:29:22,875 --> 00:29:24,915
In any democratic country,

341
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,170
there's a backyard for playing dirty
in case things turn nasty.

342
00:29:29,541 --> 00:29:31,541
And we've made things
very nasty for them.

343
00:29:33,833 --> 00:29:35,503
Well, you did.

344
00:29:35,583 --> 00:29:37,043
They can't torture him.

345
00:29:38,041 --> 00:29:39,421
It's the 21st century.

346
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,540
Sure they can.

347
00:29:43,166 --> 00:29:46,286
At a height of 35,000 feet,
above any jurisdiction,

348
00:29:46,833 --> 00:29:50,213
on the CIA flights
or in Guantanamo.

349
00:29:50,291 --> 00:29:51,961
Even Spain had terrorist commandoes.

350
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:54,331
Are you fucking kidding me, Tokyo?
Were you born yesterday?

351
00:29:55,291 --> 00:29:56,461
Professor.

352
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:00,710
We need to get Rio out.

353
00:30:00,791 --> 00:30:02,001
Are you listening?

354
00:30:03,125 --> 00:30:04,455
We need to rescue Rio.

355
00:30:04,541 --> 00:30:06,291
Did you buy any more phones?

356
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,380
Yes. Helsinki.

357
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,210
We have to gather everyone.

358
00:30:32,791 --> 00:30:33,631
Professor!

359
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,003
Professor!

360
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:40,750
Tell me you're going to save Rio.

361
00:30:42,083 --> 00:30:43,463
How, Tokyo?

362
00:30:44,125 --> 00:30:48,665
We don't even know what country,
prison or goddamn hole he is in.

363
00:30:49,791 --> 00:30:51,131
We know nothing.

364
00:30:52,458 --> 00:30:53,378
Nothing.

365
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:33,383
Professor!

366
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:43,043
Professor!

367
00:31:46,291 --> 00:31:47,791
I'm so happy to see you.

368
00:31:47,875 --> 00:31:48,705
So happy.

369
00:31:48,791 --> 00:31:51,831
- Miss Gaztambide.
- You can say Mrs.! We got married!

370
00:31:52,416 --> 00:31:54,746
Balinese rites,
an elephant and everything.

371
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:57,670
Tokyo!

372
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,000
Tokyo!

373
00:32:00,125 --> 00:32:01,915
Tokyo! Tokyo!

374
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,420
Do you want to come with me?

375
00:32:18,416 --> 00:32:20,576
Professor!

376
00:32:21,791 --> 00:32:24,291
Professor!

377
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,420
Slow down, Helsinki!

378
00:32:28,375 --> 00:32:30,955
Slow down, this is not funny!

379
00:32:31,041 --> 00:32:31,921
Helsinki!

380
00:32:46,125 --> 00:32:47,455
Asshole!

381
00:32:48,083 --> 00:32:49,253
My dress!

382
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,130
What's up?

383
00:32:54,458 --> 00:32:56,248
Nobody is going to hug me or what?

384
00:33:04,041 --> 00:33:06,791
Let's toast in silence.
Don't wake the boy up.

385
00:33:06,875 --> 00:33:08,575
Say it with an Argentinian accent.

386
00:33:08,666 --> 00:33:11,826
Hey, boludo.
Listen to me, congratulations.

387
00:33:13,208 --> 00:33:16,078
The worst Argentinian accent
I've ever heard. For real.

388
00:33:16,166 --> 00:33:18,826
- Your house is so beautiful.
- It feels like heaven in here.

389
00:33:18,916 --> 00:33:20,166
- Where's Rio?
- He knows.

390
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,960
Rio isn't coming.

391
00:33:25,833 --> 00:33:26,963
He's been arrested.

392
00:33:29,291 --> 00:33:30,381
When was that?

393
00:33:30,458 --> 00:33:32,578
Seventeen days ago
on a Caribbean island.

394
00:33:34,041 --> 00:33:35,421
It hasn't made the papers.

395
00:33:36,666 --> 00:33:38,376
He's in some shithole,
being tortured.

396
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,500
How did they find him?

397
00:33:44,041 --> 00:33:45,631
He used a satellite phone.

398
00:33:51,333 --> 00:33:52,713
Was he in danger?

399
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,330
No.

400
00:33:59,666 --> 00:34:00,666
There were rules.

401
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:03,285
No Europe.

402
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:04,875
No phones.

403
00:34:05,125 --> 00:34:06,875
What the fuck are we doing here?

404
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,170
For safety reasons.

405
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:10,830
Safety reasons,
what safety reasons?

406
00:34:10,916 --> 00:34:12,576
Rio didn't know where we were.

407
00:34:12,666 --> 00:34:13,746
Guys...

408
00:34:15,416 --> 00:34:16,376
We must help him.

409
00:34:16,458 --> 00:34:20,498
Let's see...
What the fuck are we doing here?

410
00:34:21,291 --> 00:34:23,791
Do you really think
we're going to rescue Rio?

411
00:34:23,875 --> 00:34:24,825
Yes, Denver.

412
00:34:27,583 --> 00:34:28,633
That's exactly what I think.

413
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:38,290
Jesus Christ...

414
00:34:40,083 --> 00:34:43,253
You made me cross the world
with a small baby to tell me that shit?

415
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:45,173
Are you smoking opium
in Asia, Professor?

416
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,330
Please, sit down.

417
00:34:46,416 --> 00:34:49,166
This isn't a fucking video game.
You're not my boss.

418
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:50,130
Sit down.

419
00:34:50,541 --> 00:34:52,501
You owe me your fucking life!

420
00:34:53,083 --> 00:34:54,253
Do you understand that?

421
00:34:54,333 --> 00:34:58,043
You owe me all this. That fucking backyard
and even that fucking sea

422
00:34:58,125 --> 00:35:01,455
because you can't bring
my dad back, got it?

423
00:35:03,833 --> 00:35:05,253
Listen, I have a son.

424
00:35:05,333 --> 00:35:09,083
I fucking swear I won't let him suffer
as much as I did.

425
00:35:09,166 --> 00:35:10,786
Ask him yourself

426
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,210
if he wants his daddy to get riddled
with bullets.

427
00:35:14,291 --> 00:35:15,131
Denver.

428
00:35:16,833 --> 00:35:19,753
He's being plunged into a bathtub,
with a bag around his head.

429
00:35:19,833 --> 00:35:22,673
- Do you understand?
- Sorry but that's his fucking problem.

430
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:23,880
That face...

431
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,080
you're looking at

432
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:28,826
is the same face
your dad was looking at

433
00:35:28,916 --> 00:35:30,746
while you were trying
to dig the tunnel.

434
00:35:34,458 --> 00:35:36,458
She didn't leave his side,
not for a second.

435
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:40,080
Tokyo was there.

436
00:35:44,625 --> 00:35:46,035
Rio made a mistake.

437
00:35:49,458 --> 00:35:50,998
But you also made some mistakes.

438
00:35:52,166 --> 00:35:55,666
You dragged your dad to the rooftop.
You two could have been killed.

439
00:35:56,875 --> 00:35:58,245
But the gang was there.

440
00:36:00,208 --> 00:36:03,828
Helsinki, you took the car
to the scrapyard, but didn't crush it.

441
00:36:03,916 --> 00:36:05,126
We fixed it.

442
00:36:05,625 --> 00:36:07,165
The gang was there.

443
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:10,331
You stopped the machines late,

444
00:36:11,541 --> 00:36:12,421
Nairobi.

445
00:36:13,708 --> 00:36:15,248
And the police came in.

446
00:36:17,125 --> 00:36:19,825
And you could escape through the tunnel
because Berlin...

447
00:36:21,541 --> 00:36:24,421
stayed to hold them back.

448
00:36:24,875 --> 00:36:26,825
He gave us the seconds we needed.

449
00:36:27,875 --> 00:36:29,495
The gang was there.

450
00:36:31,833 --> 00:36:33,003
The one not here now...

451
00:36:37,583 --> 00:36:38,583
is Berlin.

452
00:36:40,416 --> 00:36:41,536
Neither is Oslo.

453
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:45,626
Nor Moscow.

454
00:36:54,791 --> 00:36:56,171
No way...

455
00:37:03,208 --> 00:37:04,418
She's one of us.

456
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,500
I made a mistake.

457
00:37:12,041 --> 00:37:13,171
I lost control.

458
00:37:14,458 --> 00:37:15,828
But the gang was there.

459
00:37:28,541 --> 00:37:32,211
Now Rio has made a mistake,
like we all have.

460
00:37:34,583 --> 00:37:37,463
I can't ask you
to feel what I feel, but...

461
00:37:40,166 --> 00:37:42,326
I feel truly responsible

462
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:46,750
that some son of a bitch...

463
00:37:48,875 --> 00:37:51,915
is giving him electric shocks
while he hangs from his ankles.

464
00:38:00,208 --> 00:38:01,248
I'll go!

465
00:38:05,166 --> 00:38:06,376
You're not going, Nairobi.

466
00:38:08,375 --> 00:38:10,785
Because if you're going,
I'm going too.

467
00:38:12,041 --> 00:38:13,461
Here we go again.

468
00:38:50,833 --> 00:38:52,173
How are we going to rescue Rio?

469
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:56,455
With a robbery.
That's what we're good at.

470
00:38:57,208 --> 00:38:59,208
A robbery?
That's how we'll rescue him?

471
00:38:59,291 --> 00:39:00,541
It will begin with...

472
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:02,210
a robbery.

473
00:39:03,333 --> 00:39:04,333
But...

474
00:39:06,416 --> 00:39:08,666
But we're really going
to defy the system.

475
00:39:11,666 --> 00:39:15,626
This time we won't be those guys
who kidnap people to make their own money.

476
00:39:17,541 --> 00:39:19,501
We'll be the guys who take a stand.

477
00:39:22,166 --> 00:39:24,666
The guys who say,
enough is enough.

478
00:39:25,166 --> 00:39:27,536
What they're doing to Rio
is a declaration of war.

479
00:39:28,916 --> 00:39:30,916
And we are the resistance.

480
00:39:31,791 --> 00:39:32,791
Right?

481
00:39:34,583 --> 00:39:36,003
What are we going to rob?

482
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:38,875
The gold.

483
00:39:38,958 --> 00:39:39,958
Gold?

484
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:42,130
Not just gold.

485
00:39:43,416 --> 00:39:44,376
The gold.

486
00:39:45,041 --> 00:39:46,461
The only gold that matters.

487
00:39:50,083 --> 00:39:52,253
The national reserve
of the Bank of Spain.

488
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,630
That's a big one, isn't it?

489
00:39:56,708 --> 00:39:58,328
Never bigger.

490
00:39:59,333 --> 00:40:02,083
And that idea just came to you now,
looking at the sunrise?

491
00:40:07,041 --> 00:40:08,461
No, it's not my plan.

492
00:40:09,083 --> 00:40:10,043
Your father's?

493
00:40:14,541 --> 00:40:16,041
No. It's not my father's.

494
00:40:21,916 --> 00:40:25,576
FLORENCE
5 YEARS LEFT UNTIL D-DAY

495
00:40:41,083 --> 00:40:42,043
Andrés.

496
00:40:48,083 --> 00:40:49,543
Little brother.

497
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,670
Welcome to Italy.

498
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:03,423
A country with art, class...

499
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:07,380
where people are stylishly dressed,
unlike you.

500
00:41:07,458 --> 00:41:09,168
You look like a traveling salesman.

501
00:41:13,875 --> 00:41:14,875
Follow me.

502
00:41:21,458 --> 00:41:23,038
I'm taking you to my humble abode.

503
00:41:23,875 --> 00:41:25,825
I've got so much to tell you.

504
00:41:35,625 --> 00:41:38,625
This is the humble abode
in the country you were going to rent?

505
00:41:39,625 --> 00:41:42,575
You begin a search for a house
with two bathrooms and a garden,

506
00:41:42,916 --> 00:41:45,246
and end up renovating a monastery.

507
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:51,790
I know how to break
into the Royal Mint.

508
00:41:51,875 --> 00:41:53,245
Through the door?

509
00:41:53,333 --> 00:41:56,253
The back door. On the truck
with the with the spools of paper.

510
00:41:59,791 --> 00:42:01,211
Andrés, there's people here.

511
00:42:01,291 --> 00:42:04,211
Don't worry, we don't cross paths.
They're the perfect neighbors.

512
00:42:04,291 --> 00:42:05,581
- They're monks!
- Cistercians.

513
00:42:06,166 --> 00:42:08,376
They live in one wing,
we're in the other.

514
00:42:08,458 --> 00:42:10,748
Besides, they swore a vow of silence.

515
00:42:10,833 --> 00:42:12,213
They swore to remain silent.

516
00:42:12,291 --> 00:42:14,631
Not before a gun, or a judge,

517
00:42:14,708 --> 00:42:16,458
but before God Almighty.

518
00:42:17,083 --> 00:42:18,963
Much more interesting, isn't it?

519
00:42:21,625 --> 00:42:22,535
And...

520
00:42:22,625 --> 00:42:23,955
what did you tell them?

521
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:27,253
That I'm an intellectual
in need of austerity and solitude

522
00:42:27,333 --> 00:42:29,923
so I can write a treaty
on theological philosophy.

523
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,130
Did they believe you?

524
00:42:31,208 --> 00:42:32,918
I also paid for the refurbishment

525
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
so they didn't have to turn this beauty
into a hotel.

526
00:42:36,083 --> 00:42:38,463
They don't need anything else.
They adore me.

527
00:42:38,916 --> 00:42:41,746
Sometimes I even sing
Gregorian chants with them.

528
00:42:43,208 --> 00:42:44,128
Watch your head.

529
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,580
Andrés, do you sleep in a cell?

530
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:51,706
I intended to.
But I fell in love...

531
00:42:53,791 --> 00:42:55,081
with this chapel.

532
00:43:00,375 --> 00:43:01,535
It's wonderful, isn't it?

533
00:43:28,458 --> 00:43:32,288
Sergio, my dearest friend.
Long time no see. Come here.

534
00:43:32,375 --> 00:43:33,285
What's all this?

535
00:43:34,166 --> 00:43:37,536
Do you remember the plan to rob the gold
from the Bank of Spain?

536
00:43:37,625 --> 00:43:41,745
It's amazing. We can obtain
up to 90 tonnes of gold from there.

537
00:43:41,833 --> 00:43:43,633
We found the answer.

538
00:43:43,875 --> 00:43:45,125
And I think you'll love it.

539
00:43:45,916 --> 00:43:49,576
It's the most intelligent piece of civil
engineering since the Panama Canal...

540
00:43:49,666 --> 00:43:51,036
Wait a minute.

541
00:43:51,125 --> 00:43:54,455
I've told you a million times,
you may get the gold, but, Andrés,

542
00:43:54,541 --> 00:43:56,881
there's no way
you'll leave the Bank of Spain alive.

543
00:43:58,583 --> 00:44:01,503
Those are just insignificant details.
The gold comes first.

544
00:44:01,583 --> 00:44:03,333
We'll deal with
the people after, okay?

545
00:44:03,416 --> 00:44:07,036
- What do you mean insignificant details?
- Let's think about it later.

546
00:44:07,125 --> 00:44:09,575
Don't you think
I look a bit different?

547
00:44:09,666 --> 00:44:12,076
- Well...
- I have to tell you about a woman.

548
00:44:14,666 --> 00:44:15,916
Look at this...

549
00:44:16,458 --> 00:44:17,578
little cutie.

550
00:44:18,583 --> 00:44:20,043
Let me introduce you to Tatiana.

551
00:44:21,083 --> 00:44:22,463
Yes, she's really pretty.

552
00:44:22,541 --> 00:44:24,251
She's madly in love.

553
00:44:25,458 --> 00:44:26,578
A goddess.

554
00:44:30,958 --> 00:44:32,878
The Professor never imagined

555
00:44:34,166 --> 00:44:35,286
that one day

556
00:44:36,083 --> 00:44:38,293
he would have to make
that suicidal plan his own.

557
00:45:39,916 --> 00:45:41,456
WELCOME

558
00:45:49,125 --> 00:45:51,125
BACK

559
00:45:54,291 --> 00:45:56,501
Okay.
Most of you know the rules,

560
00:45:56,583 --> 00:45:59,333
but since there are some new faces,
we'd better review them.

561
00:45:59,416 --> 00:46:02,326
First of all,
no personal relationships.

562
00:46:04,791 --> 00:46:06,461
Well, that rule's been...

563
00:46:08,708 --> 00:46:12,458
The second rule is,
no first or last names.

564
00:46:12,541 --> 00:46:13,631
Professor.

565
00:46:14,375 --> 00:46:18,205
Let's get down to business. How are we
going to break into the Bank of Spain?

566
00:46:32,083 --> 00:46:33,213
By making a racket.

567
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:37,831
MADRID
D-DAY

568
00:47:03,208 --> 00:47:04,288
Nowadays,

569
00:47:04,833 --> 00:47:06,963
wars start with bombings.

570
00:47:07,041 --> 00:47:08,211
Ours did as well.

571
00:47:30,458 --> 00:47:32,628
That day, 140 million euros

572
00:47:32,708 --> 00:47:34,038
poured out over Madrid.

573
00:47:50,083 --> 00:47:51,713
That was our way of saying...

574
00:47:52,833 --> 00:47:54,333
We're back.
