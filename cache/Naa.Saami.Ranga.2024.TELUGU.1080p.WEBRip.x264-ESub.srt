1
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:55,708
Hey, Anji!

2
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:57,958
Fresh up and come.
Food is waiting.

3
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:05,333
Who are you?

4
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,291
I am hungry, mother.

5
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,625
I haven't eaten in two days.

6
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:10,458
Oh! Please, eat.

7
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:15,208
What is your name?

8
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:17,708
Kishtaiah.

9
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:19,083
Have it, have it.

10
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:23,375
Come. come.
Come and have your food.

11
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:33,166
Sit down first.

12
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:37,541
Here.

13
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:54,166
Who is this brother, mom?

14
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:58,041
You have already called him brother.
Consider him as one.

15
00:02:59,125 --> 00:02:59,916
Brother...

16
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:14,833
Mom!

17
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:16,250
Have you made this?
-Yes!

18
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:19,416
You are such a darling!

19
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:20,541
What about me?

20
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:22,750
You are my darling.

21
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:34,208
Sir...
-Huh?

22
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:35,791
You know the chariot festival is approaching.
-Yes!

23
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:36,875
I need some loan.

24
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,083
Festivals are most important.

25
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:41,166
Unless festivals are here,
how would we make money?

26
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,166
Huh?
-Yes.

27
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:43,125
Here!

28
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:45,000
Hello! Put this and go.

29
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:46,375
Fine fellow you are!

30
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:47,583
Careful, careful.

31
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:51,000
Oh! It’s broken.
-Sorry, sir!

32
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:52,875
Wait, wait. Don’t touch it.

33
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:54,166
Ah, Goddess Lakshmi!

34
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:55,166
Hey!

35
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:56,750
Send word for Sattemma's son.

36
00:03:57,916 --> 00:03:59,708
“O, o, o…”

37
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:14,333
Brother, focus on the job.

38
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,666
-Sir, Sir!
-Ah!

39
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:21,833
It’s done, sir.
-Is it over?

40
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:22,916
Ah!
-Keep it aside.

41
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:24,458
Careful. Careful.

42
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:26,583
Sir...

43
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:28,958
Hm?
-Money, sir.

44
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:33,541
I will pass it for interest on
your mom's loan. Get going.

45
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:35,750
He wants money!

46
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:41,875
Anji...

47
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:59,166
This is Varalu.
With a heart of gold.

48
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:01,708
Who is this?

49
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,041
Kishtaiah.
My elder brother.

50
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,916
Hey, Anji! Your mom has died!

51
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:38,166
Mom…

52
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:40,833
Mom! Get up, mom!

53
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:43,791
Mom...

54
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:49,375
Mom...

55
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,125
Mom! Get up, mom!

56
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:53,500
Oho!
-Mom!

57
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Your mom...

58
00:05:57,583 --> 00:06:00,500
had mortgaged this hut
and took a loan.

59
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:03,208
Now she passed away
without settling it.

60
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:09,958
If you lift the bier quickly,
I will take over the house.

61
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,166
If you can give me some time…
-Huh?

62
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,583
I will somehow repay your loan.

63
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,416
And how would you?

64
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:17,541
Huh?

65
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:22,500
The kid talks out of ignorance.
Lift the bier.

66
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:23,625
Hey!

67
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:29,791
Touch her and I will hack the hand.

68
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,083
How are you concerned?

69
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:34,541
She is my mother.
And he is my younger brother.

70
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:38,708
Mom, please open your eyes.

71
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:42,083
Please, make way.

72
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:45,125
Please, come, sir.

73
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,708
What is the problem?

74
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:52,625
What can I tell you?
Times have changed.

75
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,666
I lent them money against the house…

76
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,833
and the warrior comes at me
with a kitchen knife!

77
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,333
That’s the situation.

78
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,166
Bring the documents to my house
and collect your money.

79
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:05,750
Don't you hear?

80
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:12,250
This house is always yours.

81
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:15,750
Mom!

82
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:17,291
Sir!

83
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,375
What is your name?

84
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:23,208
Kishtaiah, sir.

85
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:31,375
I'll take leave, sir.

86
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:43,250
Enough! Enough!

87
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:48,875
Hey, come!

88
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:49,791
Huh!

89
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:53,375
-Sit, brother.
-Yes!

90
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,166
Hey, what are you doing?
Get up!

91
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:56,833
Hey! Get up!

92
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:59,000
Come here.
It’s okay. Come.

93
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:00,416
Sit here.

94
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,500
Wife!
-Huh?

95
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:04,125
Serve them food.
-I am doing it, husband.

96
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:06,500
Will you eat dosa?
-Hmm.

97
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:07,208
Ah!

98
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:24,291
Brother!

99
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:25,916
Brother!

100
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:28,583
Brother, Varalu is coming.

101
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:30,541
Bare your heart to her.

102
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:35,333
Tell her like ANR told Savitri in
'Preminchi Chudu’ film.

103
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:36,875
Otherwise, I will lose my face.

104
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,791
Hey, Anji!

105
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,250
What are you waiting here for?

106
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,291
My brother wants to tell you something.

107
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:48,875
Something you would like to hear.

108
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,125
Is it so, boy?

109
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:51,541
Come on. Tell me.

110
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,958
Er...actually you...

111
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:58,666
Me...

112
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:01,291
Huh?

113
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:29,583
Master…master!

114
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:34,166
Hey, hey!

115
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:38,625
Hey! Come on!
Come on, man!

116
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:40,208
Come on! Hey!

117
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:35,916
Mom!

118
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:38,625
Hey...

119
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:40,291
Where is Gopalarao's house?

120
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:41,958
Go further down and it's
the tiled house on the corner.

121
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:43,458
Hmm!

122
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:55,500
Uh, greetings, sir.

123
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:57,500
Is Bhasker home?

124
00:10:58,458 --> 00:10:59,291
Bhaski!

125
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:03,666
Dad!

126
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,541
How presumptuous you are!

127
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:21,500
You step into our village last night…
for my niece...

128
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:24,666
and jump over the wall!

129
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:27,250
Follow me quietly
and only you will go with me.

130
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:28,416
Otherwise…

131
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:32,125
Why do you trouble yourself
so much? Take him along.

132
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:32,916
Huh?

133
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:34,875
Come, come, come.

134
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,458
Hey, hey, hey!
Who the heck are you?

135
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,666
Dump him in!
-Hey, you!

136
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,333
Why are you abducting my brother-in-law?

137
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:40,916
Hey, where are you taking him?

138
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,541
Hey, father-in-law! They are taking him…

139
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:44,833
They are taking him
and why are you nodding to the clarinet?

140
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:46,208
Is your brain frozen?

141
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:47,708
Let's lodge a complaint with the police.

142
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,333
Don't stress, son-in-law.
He will come home himself.

143
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:52,000
Son-in-law… Vada is getting cold.
Please, come.

144
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:54,750
Look at you cool as cucumber
when your son is being taken.

145
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:56,666
Come on fast.
They are getting cold.

146
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,083
Hey! Damn your vada getting cold!

147
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,833
What sort of family this is!

148
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:04,333
Throw them now. Wait.
-Hmm.

149
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:05,666
Who made vada?
You or your daughter?

150
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:06,541
It was me.

151
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:07,541
Saved me. Give them now.

152
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:11,000
Did you get it straight out of
boiling oil?

153
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,458
You’re not even worried about your son.

154
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:18,333
I wonder how they are handling him.
-Why do you worry so much, son-in-law?

155
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,875
We have our master to
protect all of us.

156
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:27,291
Who?
The aged president?

157
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,458
Did you see the goons?
They were like fierce tigers!

158
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:39,875
Every village has a god to protect it.

159
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:42,250
But our village has a hunk to protect it.

160
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:43,458
Who is he?

161
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:04,833
“God Himself…”

162
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,250
“In his own hand…”

163
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:15,416
“Writes a poem”

164
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:24,041
“Anji’s…and Kishtaiah’s…”

165
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:29,541
“Inseparable bonding”

166
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:37,416
“Their blooming, smiling friendship”

167
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:44,791
“Is a lesson of whistling to the soft breeze”

168
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,500
“With joy unending…”

169
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:59,875
Anji, I forgot the match box.
-“A journey that would go on until the end”

170
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:04,000
Bullebbai, where are they?

171
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:05,083
They went this way, sir.

172
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:06,750
Give me a match box.
-I don’t have it, sir.

173
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:08,708
Fine. Let’s light it over there.

174
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:10,125
Come.
-Okay, sir!

175
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:11,041
You can start, Anji.

176
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:37,916
Akashavani...Presenting now
'The Beating You Sought' programme.

177
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:58,916
Hey, Kittaiah!

178
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:00,708
Er…this is our personal issue.

179
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,708
Don't interfere.

180
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:04,666
Hmm.

181
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:08,125
Yes. By now, Anji must have
reached this guy's village.

182
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:17,875
Why did he go to my village?

183
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:22,125
To convey the news of your death.

184
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,750
Huh?
Don’t you understand?

185
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,416
On whose orders have you come here?

186
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:29,583
Gita for the Hindus, Quran for Muslims
and Bible for Christians.

187
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:31,666
For Kishtaiah...

188
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:34,875
it's master's word.

189
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:40,750
Hey…

190
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,208
Aunty!
-Oi!

191
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:54,041
Take a clean cloth and a fistful
of turmeric and go to the farm bund.

192
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:55,000
Why?

193
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:56,625
Your younger son’s head is broken.

194
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:57,916
What? When?

195
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,833
One...two...three!

196
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:01,875
Just now.

197
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:04,791
Hey!

198
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:21,041
Kishtaiah…

199
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:23,458
No!

200
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:30,250
“Goodness gracious”

201
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,666
“My goodness gracious”

202
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:37,500
Huh?

203
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,541
Hey, aunt!

204
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,000
Oi?

205
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:51,166
Are you not going to stop?

206
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:53,791
How?
Why would your uncle let me?

207
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,500
He is going to stop you from today.

208
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,250
Why? What for?

209
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,166
Hey!

210
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,958
Sister...
what are you up to?

211
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:17,041
I am making butter for
my husband, brother.

212
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,333
What would a spineless man
do with butter?

213
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,333
Eh?

214
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:28,166
So sad!

215
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:37,458
Come on, beat him up, Kishtaiah.

216
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:41,791
Hey, grandpa!
How come you are sitting idle?

217
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:43,916
No business, kid.

218
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,250
Wait for half an hour.
You will get as busy as a bee.

219
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:47,083
Hmm?

220
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:47,916
Huh!

221
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:57,208
Hey!

222
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:14,500
If I find your wheels on our roads again,

223
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:17,583
I will flay you all alive.

224
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,541
My goodness gracious!

225
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:03,125
“Meddle with us, try to mess with us…
You will be in for a shock”

226
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:05,833
"My goodness gracious
-My goodness gracious"

227
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:12,916
"Cross your line, get caught by us...
You will be in for a shock"

228
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:15,375
"My goodness gracious
-My goodness gracious"

229
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:17,875
"When we say one,
we mean the village"

230
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:20,625
"When we say village,
we mean each one"

231
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:23,458
"When we say one...
-we mean the village"

232
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:26,291
"When we say village...
-we mean each one"

233
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:31,708
"With us...with us...
pick a fight with us and"

234
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:35,083
“Goodness gracious!”
“My goodness gracious”

235
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:37,875
“Goodness gracious!”
“My goodness gracious”

236
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:40,625
"Goodness gracious
-My goodness gracious"

237
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:43,458
"Goodness gracious
-My goodness gracious"

238
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,416
"Goodness gracious
-My goodness gracious"

239
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:49,083
“Goodness gracious!”
“My goodness gracious”

240
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,583
"This air...is highly valiant"

241
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:17,416
"This soil...is most resolute"

242
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:20,166
"This water...is full of love"

243
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:25,666
"Drinking this water,
treading this soil,"

244
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:29,875
"and breathing this air...
grew up this body"

245
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:35,125
"As long as it breathes,
it shall be loyal"

246
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:40,916
"As long as it lives,
it shall love its people"

247
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:46,458
"With us...with us...
pick a fight with us and"

248
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,833
"Goodness gracious!"
"My goodness gracious"

249
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:52,625
"Goodness gracious
-My goodness gracious"

250
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:55,416
"Goodness gracious
-My goodness gracious"

251
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:58,250
"Goodness gracious
-My goodness gracious"

252
00:20:58,541 --> 00:20:59,875
"Goodness
-gracious"

253
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:01,166
"My goodness gracious"

254
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:02,625
"Goodness
-gracious"

255
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,000
"My goodness gracious"

256
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:20,208
Hey, hey!

257
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,458
Call Vijay.

258
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,458
Boss!
-I have heard about you. Let’s move it.

259
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,083
Just a little…
-Fine, go on.

260
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:32,583
Hold on!
-Ah!

261
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:57,541
Hey Kishtaiah, come!

262
00:21:57,625 --> 00:21:59,458
Master, you carry on.
-Hey! Come on, man!

263
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:02,666
We must agree Kishtaiah is great.

264
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:04,250
Master dotes on Kishtaiah.

265
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:11,250
Dad prioritizes servants
over his own sons.

266
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,666
Kishtaiah!
-Ha!

267
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:16,500
Take care of Bhasker
until the festival is over.

268
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:17,750
Hmm?

269
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:18,708
Ok, master!
-Fine!

270
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:20,666
Anji!
-I’ll take care, brother.

271
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:30,500
By the way,
why did you jump the wall?

272
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:31,875
Festival time, brother

273
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:33,625
She wanted braid tassels to
match her skirt, brother.

274
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:34,708
I jumped over to give them to her.

275
00:22:34,791 --> 00:22:37,083
If she asked you for something,
why would you jump over the president’s wall?

276
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:38,125
Why would you?

277
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:38,875
Brother!

278
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:41,250
This heart here…
Stays fine until it falls in love.

279
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:43,041
The moment it falls in love,
it loses all reasoning.

280
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:45,375
It makes you feel it’s okay to do anything
or give anything.

281
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:50,458
The smile on her face when I give it,
and the joy it gives me…wow, wow, wow!

282
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,791
Our legs go weak and we sway
like puppets.

283
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:57,208
Forget the president’s wall,
we get ready to jump over even the China wall.

284
00:22:57,916 --> 00:23:00,333
Brother, he's trying to say something
and I'm unable to understand.

285
00:23:00,416 --> 00:23:02,125
You raise the volume
and you say it clearly.

286
00:23:02,416 --> 00:23:07,833
“Why should one go to Brindavan
and Nandavan for honeymoon?”

287
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:17,208
“Why should one go to Rameswaram
and Varanasi for a pilgrimage?”

288
00:23:17,541 --> 00:23:22,583
“When your beloved husband is right before you,
why look for another God?”

289
00:23:25,416 --> 00:23:27,750
Shall we finish the story tomorrow?
-Huh?

290
00:23:27,916 --> 00:23:30,041
Then? Why do you simply stare?

291
00:23:30,166 --> 00:23:31,291
She’s leaving. Meet her.

292
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,833
“Why should one go to Rameswaram
and Varanasi for a pilgrimage?”

293
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:55,250
“My love’s face shines like the moon
Spreading moonlight in the day”

294
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:04,500
“With the soft gaze of the beloved,
Ooty has come down here”

295
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:10,833
“Why should one go to Kodaikanal
and Kashmir for honeymoon?”

296
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:18,958
"With the soft gaze of the beloved,
Ooty has come down here”

297
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:24,333
“Why should one go to Kodaikanal
and Kashmir for honeymoon?”

298
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,958
“Why should one go to Brindavan
and Nandavan for honeymoon?”

299
00:24:41,083 --> 00:24:43,500
Great, my boy!
Such girl deserves our very life.

300
00:24:46,708 --> 00:24:48,916
“Why should one go to Rameswaram
and Varanasi for a pilgrimage?”

301
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,666
Hey!

302
00:24:50,125 --> 00:24:51,333
What are you doing here?

303
00:24:51,541 --> 00:24:52,958
I was listening to his love story, brother.

304
00:24:53,083 --> 00:24:54,875
It was so beautiful.
-I see!

305
00:24:55,375 --> 00:24:57,166
What are you planning to jump next?

306
00:24:58,375 --> 00:25:01,375
Give a break to your love story
during the festival and sit at home.

307
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:03,333
Your father-in-law is already in a rage.

308
00:25:04,083 --> 00:25:05,000
Hmm!

309
00:25:07,291 --> 00:25:09,833
My love story has become
a comedy for Kishtaiah.

310
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:11,875
He'd know that pain if he
falls in love with someone.

311
00:25:12,083 --> 00:25:15,041
Hey, hey, if you know Kishtaiah’s story,
you wouldn’t say this.

312
00:25:15,291 --> 00:25:16,458
He is in love too.

313
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,000
Our Kishtaiah? No way.

314
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,833
He knows only slaying.
Not romance. I don’t believe this.

315
00:25:21,125 --> 00:25:22,916
Hey, Kishtaiah you know is different.

316
00:25:23,083 --> 00:25:24,541
I’ll tell you his love story, come.

317
00:26:26,958 --> 00:26:27,875
Hmm?

318
00:26:28,291 --> 00:26:29,250
Pick the card.

319
00:26:29,875 --> 00:26:31,666
Here comes the king!
-Show!

320
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:32,666
You simply rocked it.

321
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,000
Collect the money.
-Hey, hand over the money.

322
00:26:34,666 --> 00:26:37,041
Hey, I heard Varadarajulu’s daughter, Varalu,
has returned? -King made me win.

323
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:40,083
She went to Madras for studies
and returned after fifteen years.

324
00:26:43,166 --> 00:26:45,250
Mahalaxmi dear, don’t be worried.

325
00:26:45,458 --> 00:26:48,375
Go with grandma
and study well in the city.

326
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,666
And I will, of course,
come to see you every week.

327
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:52,208
Don’t get home sick.

328
00:27:01,625 --> 00:27:04,166
Her clothes...her styling...
What a change in her!

329
00:27:04,416 --> 00:27:06,541
She is pink in complexion they say.

330
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:09,125
She looks like a film heroine.

331
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:11,083
Why? How are we less?

332
00:27:16,666 --> 00:27:18,750
You can't take it when someone
is beautiful, can you?

333
00:27:18,916 --> 00:27:20,208
You will be damned!

334
00:27:21,291 --> 00:27:22,541
Don't cast your evil eye!

335
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:25,833
Why is he getting so upset?

336
00:28:00,208 --> 00:28:01,458
Namaste!
-Namaste!

337
00:28:06,916 --> 00:28:07,708
Master!

338
00:28:08,333 --> 00:28:09,416
Kishtaiah.
-Please come, Master…

339
00:28:10,958 --> 00:28:11,750
Master has arrived.

340
00:28:12,666 --> 00:28:14,583
Madam, please come.
Be seated.

341
00:28:14,666 --> 00:28:15,750
Namaste!
Please sit.

342
00:28:46,541 --> 00:28:47,416
Hey!

343
00:28:47,958 --> 00:28:49,041
Switch on the lights!

344
00:29:26,625 --> 00:29:27,708
This is Varalu….

345
00:29:34,958 --> 00:29:36,916
Hey, Varalu! Have you just come?
-Yes.

346
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,250
Sit.
-How is everyone?

347
00:29:44,875 --> 00:29:46,416
Varalu, did you notice?

348
00:29:46,541 --> 00:29:48,208
Our village has changed a lot.

349
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,333
Really?
-Hmm.

350
00:29:49,666 --> 00:29:52,083
They have even painted
the school we attended.

351
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:53,541
Do you at least know that?

352
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,625
They have replaced the old bridge
with a new one.

353
00:29:55,708 --> 00:29:56,666
Did you at least notice that?

354
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:57,375
No!

355
00:30:12,333 --> 00:30:13,250
Be blessed!

356
00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:21,583
Take his blessings too.

357
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:22,708
Manga, come here.

358
00:30:23,041 --> 00:30:24,375
Bless us, brother.
-Brother!

359
00:30:24,666 --> 00:30:25,541
Hey, hey!

360
00:30:26,083 --> 00:30:27,958
Only one of you should
call me brother.

361
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:39,750
Bah! This is such a torture!

362
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:45,833
Oho!

363
00:30:46,333 --> 00:30:48,166
“Here is the charming girl”

364
00:30:48,625 --> 00:30:51,041
“Watch her mischief, Anji”

365
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,833
“Here is the charming girl”

366
00:30:54,333 --> 00:30:56,625
“Watch her mischief, Anji”

367
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:02,416
“A lass from Nellore, Anji. She came
in my dreams and tugged at me"

368
00:31:03,166 --> 00:31:05,833
“She threw a challenge
and invited for a game”

369
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:08,708
“Here and there and everywhere
including the banana plantation"

370
00:31:08,958 --> 00:31:11,541
“She asked me to have
unlimited fun”

371
00:31:11,833 --> 00:31:13,750
“Here is the charming girl”

372
00:31:14,375 --> 00:31:16,708
“Watch her mischief, Anji”

373
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:19,333
“Here is the charming girl”

374
00:31:19,916 --> 00:31:22,500
“Watch her mischief, Anji”

375
00:31:27,666 --> 00:31:29,916
Hey, stop it. Stop it!
I said stop it!

376
00:31:30,333 --> 00:31:31,166
Hey, move! Move!

377
00:31:31,666 --> 00:31:32,916
It’s so blaring on the ears...

378
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:35,000
They started bleeding!

379
00:31:35,083 --> 00:31:37,250
We have a celebration in
our family after 25 years, sir.

380
00:31:37,291 --> 00:31:38,125
So?

381
00:31:38,291 --> 00:31:39,958
You expect the whole village
to dance?

382
00:31:40,541 --> 00:31:41,875
You have no parents.

383
00:31:41,958 --> 00:31:43,833
She has no parents either.

384
00:31:44,208 --> 00:31:44,875
Huh?

385
00:31:44,958 --> 00:31:46,500
There is nothing to say about
this guy.

386
00:31:46,541 --> 00:31:50,833
This is an orphan wedding and you
want songs on high watt mike set.

387
00:31:52,166 --> 00:31:54,708
You were two till now.
Now you are three.

388
00:31:54,791 --> 00:31:55,958
What is so big a change?

389
00:31:56,166 --> 00:31:57,583
This is not a home, man!

390
00:31:57,625 --> 00:31:58,958
This is an orphanage.

391
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,875
Shut up!

392
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,791
Why are you running your mouth?

393
00:32:04,583 --> 00:32:06,666
You can't understand
someone's tears.

394
00:32:06,875 --> 00:32:08,125
You can’t tolerate their smiles.

395
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:09,125
Hey!

396
00:32:09,416 --> 00:32:11,000
How are you even born human?

397
00:32:12,208 --> 00:32:15,750
Give me four names from the village...
who would carry your bier.

398
00:32:16,833 --> 00:32:17,958
Who is an orphan?

399
00:32:18,666 --> 00:32:20,666
Say that again and...

400
00:32:21,375 --> 00:32:22,666
My goodness gracious!

401
00:32:28,916 --> 00:32:30,500
What is this, brother? Why did
you pick a fight with him?

402
00:32:30,666 --> 00:32:32,125
After all he is your future
father-in-law.

403
00:32:32,166 --> 00:32:34,083
So? How are we orphans?

404
00:32:34,833 --> 00:32:36,750
I have you.
And you have me.

405
00:32:37,458 --> 00:32:38,625
Now we have that precious soul.

406
00:32:42,041 --> 00:32:43,875
Don't start crying now.
I would be blamed.

407
00:32:45,125 --> 00:32:46,791
Especially when there is
so much involved tonight.

408
00:32:54,875 --> 00:32:56,083
Why do you feel shy? Do it.

409
00:32:56,166 --> 00:32:57,125
Why don't you?

410
00:33:01,041 --> 00:33:02,208
Enough with the games.

411
00:33:02,291 --> 00:33:03,666
All of you leave now.
-Hey, hey!

412
00:33:03,791 --> 00:33:04,750
You remember, right?

413
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,791
Yes, I do.
Get going now.

414
00:33:08,916 --> 00:33:09,833
What about you?

415
00:33:09,958 --> 00:33:11,541
You want to supervise?
Get lost!

416
00:33:12,208 --> 00:33:13,958
I won't open the door till morning.

417
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:17,416
Sir?

418
00:33:17,541 --> 00:33:18,291
Hmm?

419
00:33:18,375 --> 00:33:21,458
Isn’t it Varadarajulu’s daughter
Varalu, you are in love with?

420
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:24,000
What is it now?

421
00:33:24,125 --> 00:33:24,916
It’s not that.

422
00:33:25,166 --> 00:33:27,875
You have lots of stories to say
about your love.

423
00:33:28,083 --> 00:33:30,750
But she didn't even look at you
in the wedding.

424
00:33:31,958 --> 00:33:34,625
And then you manhandled the man who is
supposed to give you his daughter’s hand.

425
00:33:34,958 --> 00:33:38,125
What you say and what I see
don’t sync at all.

426
00:33:38,666 --> 00:33:39,333
Hey…
-Huh?

427
00:33:39,458 --> 00:33:40,166
Get going.

428
00:33:40,833 --> 00:33:41,583
Hmm!

429
00:33:43,166 --> 00:33:44,833
Keep the radio here.
-Okay, sir!

430
00:33:45,166 --> 00:33:46,791
I only questioned him on what he said.
-Idiot...

431
00:33:46,916 --> 00:33:47,875
He must be offended.

432
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:54,083
“Some strange desires disturb my heart”

433
00:33:54,666 --> 00:34:01,625
"Those naughty jasmines
eavesdrop hiding behind the leaves"

434
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:04,958
But she didn’t even look at you
at the wedding.

435
00:34:14,125 --> 00:34:18,166
"Get up, get up, my dear"

436
00:34:18,791 --> 00:34:22,250
"Won't you get up?
Do you want me to wake you up?"

437
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,583
Who is waking me up?

438
00:34:26,166 --> 00:34:27,458
I will be right back.
Don’t go to sleep.

439
00:34:27,791 --> 00:34:28,708
Yes, coming...

440
00:34:31,166 --> 00:34:32,416
What is it, brother?
-Hey!

441
00:34:32,791 --> 00:34:35,458
Varalu didn’t recognize me, man.
Probably, she forgot.

442
00:34:35,541 --> 00:34:37,833
Is that so important now?
Why don’t we talk tomorrow?

443
00:34:37,916 --> 00:34:39,125
Hmm.

444
00:34:41,166 --> 00:34:44,083
"Up, get up, my dear"

445
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:48,916
"Please, wake up, my dear"

446
00:34:49,958 --> 00:34:53,583
"Won't you get up?
Do you want me to wake you up?"

447
00:34:55,833 --> 00:34:57,291
Brother, what is this?

448
00:34:57,916 --> 00:35:01,125
Hey, ever since I saw Varalu,
I have lost control of my heart.

449
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:03,625
I want to start wedding
arrangements fast.

450
00:35:04,416 --> 00:35:05,583
I would like to start too, brother.

451
00:35:05,708 --> 00:35:07,458
Today is the first day.
I will be blamed.

452
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,916
I imagined so many things, man.

453
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:10,625
I imagined lots of things
too, brother.

454
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:11,875
About all that I should do.

455
00:35:12,083 --> 00:35:13,625
Brother, let us discuss this tomorrow.

456
00:35:13,791 --> 00:35:14,500
Hmm.

457
00:35:17,083 --> 00:35:19,666
"Get up, get up, my dear"

458
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:23,458
"Please, get up, my dear"

459
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:30,166
“Won’t you wake up?
Do you want me to wake you up?”

460
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:32,125
Brother…

461
00:35:33,291 --> 00:35:36,708
Anji! From the moment I saw Varalu,
I just don't know what to do.

462
00:35:36,916 --> 00:35:39,541
I totally know what to do
but you won’t let me.

463
00:35:39,791 --> 00:35:41,000
It’s not that…
-Brother!

464
00:35:41,458 --> 00:35:44,208
All that I want to do inside,
you call me out and do exactly same.

465
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:46,083
We will sort this out in
the morning, okay? Here.

466
00:35:46,125 --> 00:35:47,333
Go, go.
-Sleep.

467
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:54,083
"Get up, get up, my dear"

468
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:58,500
"Please, get up, my dear"

469
00:35:59,458 --> 00:36:02,875
"Won't you get up?
Do you want me to wake you up?"

470
00:36:03,875 --> 00:36:06,708
I wanted to stay awake the whole night.
And look at you sleeping!

471
00:36:07,625 --> 00:36:08,500
Brother!

472
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:10,375
Sir, sir!
-Hmm.

473
00:36:10,583 --> 00:36:12,708
What is the secret behind
salt and basil water?

474
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:14,208
Silly fellow!

475
00:36:14,916 --> 00:36:17,750
When we give money with salt,
the loan never gets repaid.

476
00:36:18,291 --> 00:36:22,291
But when we sprinkle basil water,
this sinful money gets purified.

477
00:36:22,708 --> 00:36:24,666
That is the secret behind.
Get it?

478
00:36:24,791 --> 00:36:25,500
Ah…huh!

479
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:27,083
Move it.
You can go.

480
00:36:30,416 --> 00:36:31,458
Brother, come.

481
00:36:31,875 --> 00:36:32,791
Come on, brother.

482
00:36:32,916 --> 00:36:34,791
Why would she forget you just
because she studied in Madras?

483
00:36:34,958 --> 00:36:36,166
Anji, give me those glasses.

484
00:36:36,208 --> 00:36:37,083
Huh! Here!

485
00:36:45,166 --> 00:36:46,041
Hmm!

486
00:36:46,416 --> 00:36:49,458
How come the newly married groom
is knocking at our door early morning?

487
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:52,625
I mean…couldn’t greet you properly
at my wedding yesterday.

488
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:54,916
Have you recognized?
Kishtaiah... my elder brother.

489
00:36:56,375 --> 00:36:57,250
Kishtaiah?

490
00:36:57,416 --> 00:36:58,166
Didn’t I tell you?

491
00:36:58,291 --> 00:36:59,750
She won’t forget us though
she went to Madras.

492
00:37:00,666 --> 00:37:02,375
Ah…Kishtaiah?

493
00:37:02,666 --> 00:37:03,291
Hmm.

494
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:06,291
Was it you who caught my dad
by his collar?

495
00:37:06,333 --> 00:37:07,333
Huh?
-Was it you?

496
00:37:08,583 --> 00:37:11,125
You catch my dad’s collar...

497
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:12,583
and how dare you come home now?
-No, no, no.

498
00:37:12,708 --> 00:37:14,250
Don’t ever show your face to me!

499
00:37:23,916 --> 00:37:25,500
He would face a hundred
people alone.

500
00:37:25,666 --> 00:37:27,166
But he couldn’t face a girl.

501
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:28,583
That is what you call love, brother.

502
00:37:29,541 --> 00:37:30,833
Hey, stop it!

503
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:33,125
The older ones already got married.

504
00:37:33,291 --> 00:37:35,708
Anji too got married.

505
00:37:36,083 --> 00:37:37,875
Now only Das and you are left.

506
00:37:38,791 --> 00:37:40,666
We are also looking for
a nice match for Das.

507
00:37:41,375 --> 00:37:43,041
Wedding will be soon after
he returns from Dubai.

508
00:37:44,583 --> 00:37:46,041
Now, let’s come to you.

509
00:37:47,166 --> 00:37:48,333
Tell me who the girl is.

510
00:37:48,791 --> 00:37:49,916
I will go talk to them.

511
00:37:51,083 --> 00:37:53,000
But she should come to me
understanding my love for her.

512
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:54,500
Not because someone has
told her.

513
00:37:54,666 --> 00:37:57,833
If she does come for me,
I will bring her to you then.

514
00:37:58,416 --> 00:38:00,583
You can go talk to her father
and get us married.

515
00:38:00,666 --> 00:38:03,250
When will she look at you again?
And when will she feel your love?

516
00:38:03,541 --> 00:38:06,666
Anyway, she is like the hilsa fish.
Very difficult to catch her.

517
00:38:07,041 --> 00:38:08,250
Why would you say that?

518
00:38:08,583 --> 00:38:10,416
Don’t tell me she won’t fall
for my brother?

519
00:38:10,666 --> 00:38:13,083
He might fall after one more peg.
But she won’t fall for him.

520
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:16,375
It’s not the bulls in the village to
get scared of your brother and obey.

521
00:38:16,541 --> 00:38:18,833
She is a city bred college girl.
Not so easy.

522
00:38:19,083 --> 00:38:20,583
Hey…
-Hmm.

523
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:25,416
If I don’t take her on my
bicycle by this time tomorrow.

524
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,833
My goodness gracious...

525
00:38:36,666 --> 00:38:37,958
Sister Varalu! Sister Varalu!

526
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,916
They are beating up your dad
near the farm bund on the outskirts.

527
00:38:40,958 --> 00:38:42,250
Huh? My dad?

528
00:38:44,541 --> 00:38:45,250
Let's go!

529
00:38:49,625 --> 00:38:50,500
Hey, boy!

530
00:38:50,583 --> 00:38:51,916
Huh? What is it, girl?

531
00:38:52,541 --> 00:38:55,041
I need to go the farm bund on
the outskirts. Can you take me?

532
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:57,625
You told me not to show
my face to you.

533
00:38:58,166 --> 00:38:59,750
Find someone else.

534
00:39:01,625 --> 00:39:03,333
Damn!
They are thrashing my dad.

535
00:39:03,458 --> 00:39:04,250
Hey, girl!

536
00:39:04,541 --> 00:39:06,583
By the time you reach there
walking like a swan,

537
00:39:06,791 --> 00:39:08,500
your dad would have
a second round.

538
00:39:10,166 --> 00:39:13,125
If there is someone going that side
on a cycle, try hitching a hike.

539
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,166
Which way are you going?

540
00:39:15,291 --> 00:39:18,166
I am going to the farm on
the outskirts on some work.

541
00:39:18,916 --> 00:39:20,791
Why don’t you take me along then?

542
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:21,791
Huh?

543
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,500
There is no carriage at the back.

544
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,333
Is that okay?

545
00:39:30,458 --> 00:39:31,333
Hmm...?

546
00:39:33,166 --> 00:39:33,875
Hmm.

547
00:39:43,291 --> 00:39:44,125
Huh?

548
00:39:45,666 --> 00:39:47,208
What the heck!
He has managed to impress her.

549
00:39:48,166 --> 00:39:50,833
Hey, Bullabbai! You spoke about
some hilsa fish and how rare it is.

550
00:39:51,416 --> 00:39:53,500
Who knew you had such
a long fish pole?

551
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:54,708
The fish is not cooked yet.

552
00:39:54,958 --> 00:39:56,166
I will tell you when it is done.

553
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:57,916
When is the wedding?

554
00:39:57,958 --> 00:39:58,916
What wedding?

555
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:00,458
Oh, no! Your dad!
Come on.

556
00:40:00,625 --> 00:40:01,708
Great fish pole!

557
00:40:03,791 --> 00:40:05,000
Hey, stop! Stop!

558
00:40:05,166 --> 00:40:06,333
Stop!
-Oh, no!

559
00:40:07,083 --> 00:40:07,875
Hmm, hmm.

560
00:40:09,291 --> 00:40:10,916
You must be careful, right?
-Okay!

561
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:19,208
Hey!
-Huh?

562
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:21,375
You said she is from the city
and won’t relent?

563
00:40:22,416 --> 00:40:23,750
Who is he talking about?

564
00:40:24,166 --> 00:40:27,000
He says a heifer has come from
the city. And it can’t be handled.

565
00:40:28,083 --> 00:40:29,583
Why just the bulls?

566
00:40:29,791 --> 00:40:32,000
Even heifers listen to you.
I have just found out.

567
00:40:32,041 --> 00:40:33,333
You have found out just now.

568
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,375
They have known it for long.

569
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:38,958
Do you think I can manage
a heifer?

570
00:40:39,875 --> 00:40:41,541
Ah! Of course, it will give in.

571
00:40:41,666 --> 00:40:42,791
Ah! See?

572
00:40:43,041 --> 00:40:44,875
She says it will surrender.
The girl says so.

573
00:40:45,583 --> 00:40:46,375
What?

574
00:40:46,583 --> 00:40:49,416
Keep asking me all kinds of questions
and your dad will be beaten up more.

575
00:40:49,458 --> 00:40:50,625
Shall we go?
-Yes!

576
00:40:58,125 --> 00:40:58,916
Be at it!

577
00:40:59,041 --> 00:40:59,833
What’s happening?

578
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:02,125
He told me someone was
beating my dad?

579
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:08,500
So, did you do this purposely?

580
00:41:08,791 --> 00:41:11,666
The school you had attended...
does it look good after being painted?

581
00:41:13,208 --> 00:41:14,416
Hey, hey! Stop!

582
00:41:19,208 --> 00:41:22,125
Cycle ride on the new bridge...
was it good?

583
00:41:25,333 --> 00:41:26,250
Hey, girl!

584
00:41:32,333 --> 00:41:33,958
What are these?
-Toe rings!

585
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,000
Go, give them to your wife.

586
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:38,500
Look here.
-Hmm?

587
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,791
I'll store them safe on my heart
and give them after the wedding.

588
00:41:49,833 --> 00:41:54,083
“Clad in a sari in onion pink
and tucking the pleats high”

589
00:41:54,625 --> 00:41:58,791
“Clad in a sari in onion pink
and tucking the pleats high”

590
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:02,916
“Do you call yourself
a rich kid, beauty?”

591
00:42:03,708 --> 00:42:08,208
“Cute looking sweet little lady
Come forward dainty beauty”

592
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:12,958
“Cute looking sweet little lady
Come forward dainty beauty”

593
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:20,416
“Wearing a ridge gourd green blouse
And sporting a coin sized vermilion”

594
00:42:20,833 --> 00:42:25,083
“Wearing a ridge gourd green blouse
And sporting a coin sized vermilion”

595
00:42:25,625 --> 00:42:28,833
“Why do you say you won’t
step out, lady?”

596
00:42:30,166 --> 00:42:34,541
“Cute looking sweet little lady
Come forward dainty beauty”

597
00:42:34,875 --> 00:42:39,458
“Cute looking sweet little lady
Come forward dainty beauty”

598
00:42:42,791 --> 00:42:44,291
“Shall I carry you away?”

599
00:42:47,416 --> 00:42:49,291
“Shall I carry you away?”

600
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:54,083
“Glances that are sweet
and delicious”

601
00:42:54,583 --> 00:42:56,500
“Words harsh and pungent”

602
00:42:56,875 --> 00:43:01,250
“With a waist of a jasmine
and dame with style abundant”

603
00:43:01,708 --> 00:43:04,916
“As you walk ahead…
O o o o o …”

604
00:43:06,541 --> 00:43:10,083
“And as I stand watching you…
O o o o o ….”

605
00:43:10,958 --> 00:43:15,333
“I want to carry you away, girl!
I want to carry you away”

606
00:43:20,416 --> 00:43:24,875
“I want to carry you away, girl!
I want to carry you away”

607
00:43:25,375 --> 00:43:30,041
“Rolling you up, making a bundle,
carrying on my head, along Godavari”

608
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:34,416
“I want to carry you away, girl!
I want to carry you away”

609
00:43:34,958 --> 00:43:39,666
“Filling you in a pot, lifting your weight
Without letting you go, until death”

610
00:43:39,833 --> 00:43:44,083
“I want to carry you away, girl!
I want to carry you away”

611
00:43:44,833 --> 00:43:48,958
“I want to carry you away, girl!
I want to carry you away”

612
00:43:49,791 --> 00:43:51,125
“Shall I carry you away?”

613
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,250
“Shall I carry you away?”

614
00:44:18,583 --> 00:44:22,625
“As you amble along…
touched by your feet”

615
00:44:23,208 --> 00:44:27,000
“Clay-made balls
Have turned into tinkling bells”

616
00:44:27,958 --> 00:44:29,791
“When you smile…”

617
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:32,250
“The sweetness of your smile”

618
00:44:32,833 --> 00:44:36,416
“Makes the tree branches
turn into honeycombs”

619
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:41,708
“You are so, so, so very cute”

620
00:44:42,375 --> 00:44:46,333
“To put it in one, single word”

621
00:44:46,875 --> 00:44:49,166
“If the moon had kids…”

622
00:44:51,375 --> 00:44:57,416
“Hey, if the moon had kids, it’d
show you and feed them in joy”

623
00:44:58,541 --> 00:45:01,000
“What could I do when you
are so pretty?”

624
00:45:01,291 --> 00:45:05,625
“I want to carry you away, girl!
I want to carry you away”

625
00:45:06,041 --> 00:45:10,583
“I want to carry you away, girl!
I want to carry you away”

626
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:13,041
“You are the queen
of my heart’s fortress”

627
00:45:13,333 --> 00:45:15,625
“On the palanquin of my
two legs…”

628
00:45:15,833 --> 00:45:20,083
“I want to carry you away, girl!
I want to carry you away”

629
00:45:20,333 --> 00:45:25,125
“Until babies bloom from our love
and you carry them on your side,”

630
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:29,625
“I want to carry you away, girl!
I want to carry you away”

631
00:45:30,041 --> 00:45:34,541
“I want to carry you away, girl!
I want to carry you away”

632
00:45:44,291 --> 00:45:46,000
Why have you brought me
here now?

633
00:45:46,166 --> 00:45:48,500
Varalu asked you to meet, brother.
Please, go. I'll wait there.

634
00:46:18,125 --> 00:46:20,000
Why did you ask me to meet
in private?

635
00:46:20,458 --> 00:46:21,291
Urm…

636
00:46:21,583 --> 00:46:22,791
I want to tell you something.

637
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:24,291
Keep it to yourself.

638
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:26,208
Tell me. What is it?

639
00:46:27,375 --> 00:46:28,791
When I get married,

640
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:33,416
I should know how to be
with my husband, right?

641
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:34,666
Hmm.

642
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:37,666
That’s why… I asked my maid
for advice…

643
00:46:38,166 --> 00:46:42,000
Do this. There is a show at 5pm
in Bhaskar Talkies.

644
00:46:42,333 --> 00:46:44,291
Watch it.
You will know everything.

645
00:46:45,125 --> 00:46:46,083
Hmm…

646
00:46:50,208 --> 00:46:52,833
I mean…actually…

647
00:46:53,291 --> 00:46:55,250
Don’t tell me you want me to
take you to the movie?

648
00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:56,458
Hmm.

649
00:46:58,583 --> 00:47:00,375
Have you lost your mind?

650
00:47:00,583 --> 00:47:02,833
Hey, I asked you something
for the first time.

651
00:47:03,166 --> 00:47:04,291
Why can't you take me?

652
00:47:04,458 --> 00:47:06,166
I have some reputation here.

653
00:47:06,458 --> 00:47:08,291
If people come to know
we went to that kind of movie…

654
00:47:08,583 --> 00:47:09,875
Damn! I can’t do this.

655
00:47:11,333 --> 00:47:12,250
Hey, brother!

656
00:47:12,375 --> 00:47:14,166
Why do you look so dazed?
What did she ask for?

657
00:47:14,541 --> 00:47:17,791
If you hear what she asked, you will
be so shocked you will need a tablet.

658
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,500
Whatever. She has asked you
for something.

659
00:47:19,541 --> 00:47:21,333
Do it. Do it.
Otherwise, we will be blamed.

660
00:47:25,208 --> 00:47:25,875
Fine.

661
00:47:26,791 --> 00:47:28,166
Get ready for tomorrow evening.

662
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:30,500
Hmm.

663
00:47:57,625 --> 00:47:58,583
What's the matter?

664
00:47:59,041 --> 00:48:00,541
You got ready so well?

665
00:48:01,041 --> 00:48:03,166
We are going for the movies.
That’s why.

666
00:48:03,625 --> 00:48:05,625
We are not going for
a devotional movie.

667
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:07,416
It's a spicy movie.

668
00:48:07,541 --> 00:48:10,333
If you go to the movie like this,
my goodness gracious!

669
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:12,250
Hmm!
How should I get ready then?

670
00:48:25,791 --> 00:48:26,666
Hey, Anji!

671
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:28,625
Why are you sitting in the front
like a girl covering your face?

672
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:29,708
So that you can question me.

673
00:48:37,625 --> 00:48:38,541
Come fast.

674
00:48:38,625 --> 00:48:40,000
They might play the bits already.
-Hold on.

675
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:41,750
You shouldn’t walk in for
these films just like that.

676
00:48:41,791 --> 00:48:42,458
Then?

677
00:48:42,791 --> 00:48:44,250
He switches off the lights
when it’s time.

678
00:48:44,541 --> 00:48:46,291
I will count to three.
-Hmm.

679
00:48:46,375 --> 00:48:48,750
We should get in even
before we know.

680
00:48:49,125 --> 00:48:50,375
Hmm.
-Hmm.

681
00:48:52,166 --> 00:48:53,041
Fast!

682
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:55,041
One.

683
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:56,916
Two…what the heck!

684
00:48:57,041 --> 00:48:58,750
Hey, hey! Wait! Wait, wait.

685
00:48:58,833 --> 00:48:59,958
Hey!
-Huh?

686
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,375
Who will buy the tickets? Huh?
-What?

687
00:49:01,708 --> 00:49:03,083
Huh?
-Give two tickets.

688
00:49:03,875 --> 00:49:04,833
Come fast!

689
00:49:04,916 --> 00:49:05,916
Let’s go! Let’s go!

690
00:49:17,291 --> 00:49:18,791
I wonder when they will play
the bits.

691
00:49:26,583 --> 00:49:27,916
How come there are so many?

692
00:49:29,458 --> 00:49:30,333
Hunger.

693
00:49:30,541 --> 00:49:31,500
For so many?

694
00:49:31,708 --> 00:49:32,541
Hmm.

695
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:39,458
Did they play the bits, brother?
-Hmm?

696
00:49:41,208 --> 00:49:42,541
Brother, did they play any bits?

697
00:49:42,583 --> 00:49:43,458
Not yet, brother.

698
00:49:43,666 --> 00:49:45,916
No one is buying popcorn and samosa.
-Hey, hey!

699
00:49:46,041 --> 00:49:47,916
So, they will play the bits
after the intermission.

700
00:49:48,041 --> 00:49:49,541
I wonder when the intermission
will be.

701
00:49:54,416 --> 00:49:55,458
What’s so special about it?

702
00:49:55,916 --> 00:49:57,750
Everyone is watching like
a normal film.

703
00:49:58,208 --> 00:49:59,333
What is there to watch?

704
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:02,375
After the interval,
you will see real acting here.

705
00:50:09,375 --> 00:50:10,291
Bah, bah!

706
00:50:11,125 --> 00:50:12,541
All the youth seem to be here...

707
00:50:12,916 --> 00:50:14,750
Hey!
Aren’t you Chinnarao’s son?

708
00:50:15,083 --> 00:50:17,125
Are you not ashamed
to watch these films?

709
00:50:17,208 --> 00:50:18,958
Hey! Learn from my son.

710
00:50:19,083 --> 00:50:20,208
He is a diamond.
-Huh?

711
00:50:20,291 --> 00:50:21,916
He doesn’t step out of the house.

712
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:23,750
Huh?

713
00:50:24,083 --> 00:50:25,291
Sir, isn’t this your diamond?

714
00:50:25,416 --> 00:50:27,541
Bloody scoundrel!
You also had to land here! Sit down!

715
00:50:27,666 --> 00:50:28,708
Waste of ticket.

716
00:50:30,333 --> 00:50:32,708
When bits come, bend your head.
You are ruining my reputation.

717
00:50:32,833 --> 00:50:33,541
Damn it!
-Huh?

718
00:50:33,583 --> 00:50:34,791
Society is gone to dogs, brother.

719
00:50:34,875 --> 00:50:37,333
We shouldn’t blame them.
We should blame their teachers.

720
00:50:37,458 --> 00:50:38,208
I know.

721
00:50:38,875 --> 00:50:39,750
Hmm?

722
00:50:39,875 --> 00:50:41,916
Subbaiah sir! You are also here!

723
00:50:42,583 --> 00:50:46,291
I was stressed from teaching.

724
00:50:46,583 --> 00:50:47,666
That’s why...

725
00:50:48,958 --> 00:50:50,875
Stress... my foot! Thirst!

726
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,166
They began the screening.

727
00:51:20,666 --> 00:51:21,583
Enough. Let's go.

728
00:51:21,875 --> 00:51:22,833
Wait.

729
00:51:23,041 --> 00:51:24,333
It has just started.

730
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,041
I said enough.
I have understood.

731
00:51:27,083 --> 00:51:27,958
Aha…

732
00:51:28,166 --> 00:51:29,250
Bah, let's go!

733
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:32,916
Hey! Why are you leaving just
when the bits are being screened?

734
00:51:32,958 --> 00:51:34,750
Bend your head,
lower your head.

735
00:51:34,833 --> 00:51:35,833
Look at the screen, man.

736
00:52:11,041 --> 00:52:11,916
Brother!

737
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:15,041
Did you watch ‘Premnagar’?
-I saw.

738
00:52:16,291 --> 00:52:18,208
-Did you see 'Premambhishekam'?
-Yes!

739
00:52:18,541 --> 00:52:20,000
How touching they are!

740
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:22,208
Those are pure love stories.

741
00:52:23,041 --> 00:52:25,666
These two went to a spicy film
and they call theirs a love story.

742
00:52:26,625 --> 00:52:29,666
'A hasty groom made a pass
at a guest.'

743
00:52:30,125 --> 00:52:31,500
Listen to the complete story.

744
00:52:32,875 --> 00:52:34,333
Varalu called Kishtaiah again.

745
00:52:35,833 --> 00:52:37,791
Actually…that…

746
00:52:40,041 --> 00:52:41,166
Which movie this time?

747
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:43,708
Um hmm, not that.

748
00:52:54,708 --> 00:52:55,583
What is it?

749
00:52:55,625 --> 00:52:56,916
I want to wear those clothes.

750
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
There is a doctor named Gandham
Nagaraju at the end of the village.

751
00:53:03,708 --> 00:53:06,583
Until you see him,
don't walk among public.

752
00:53:07,125 --> 00:53:08,250
Why do you say that?

753
00:53:08,666 --> 00:53:10,083
Can't I wear those clothes?

754
00:53:10,375 --> 00:53:13,125
She is hardly wearing anything.
What is left there for you to wear?

755
00:53:15,666 --> 00:53:17,916
Anyway, I can't wear such clothes
once I am married.

756
00:53:18,416 --> 00:53:20,500
That’s why I want to wear them
at least once.

757
00:53:20,583 --> 00:53:21,958
A small wish, boy.

758
00:53:22,666 --> 00:53:25,416
You wanted clips yesterday.
Today it's clothes.

759
00:53:25,916 --> 00:53:27,333
Whatever you are up to!

760
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:32,375
What?
What did she ask you, brother?

761
00:53:33,791 --> 00:53:35,458
She doesn't know what to ask.

762
00:53:35,916 --> 00:53:37,583
You have no idea what
she is asking.

763
00:53:37,708 --> 00:53:39,041
I have no clue what I should do.

764
00:53:39,208 --> 00:53:40,583
Something. She has asked you.

765
00:53:40,666 --> 00:53:42,291
Go ahead and do it.
Or we will be blamed.

766
00:53:47,041 --> 00:53:48,750
"You and I..."

767
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:04,708
Is this murrel?
It’s so delicious!

768
00:54:04,833 --> 00:54:05,791
Who made it?

769
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,958
Why would I bring you curry
made by someone else?

770
00:54:08,375 --> 00:54:09,916
I cooked it with my own hands.

771
00:54:10,208 --> 00:54:14,291
After my mom, it's your cooking
that I am enjoying most.

772
00:54:15,416 --> 00:54:17,916
Enough with your butter.
Shall I come?

773
00:54:18,791 --> 00:54:21,375
It wouldn't be nice if I said that.
But please come.

774
00:54:39,583 --> 00:54:40,541
Is it good?

775
00:54:40,916 --> 00:54:41,958
To look at…

776
00:54:46,416 --> 00:54:47,541
I find it good.

777
00:54:47,833 --> 00:54:50,708
It's not that, boy.
What do you feel looking at me?

778
00:54:50,916 --> 00:54:54,166
How does it feel when piping hot rice
with fish curry is placed before you?

779
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:56,208
How does it feel?

780
00:54:56,750 --> 00:54:58,500
You feel like eating it up.

781
00:54:59,958 --> 00:55:00,875
What?

782
00:55:02,625 --> 00:55:03,750
Hmm. Anyway…

783
00:55:04,041 --> 00:55:07,916
Probably, my husband would
feel the same after I get married.

784
00:56:13,291 --> 00:56:15,166
It's past eight.
Why didn't you come?

785
00:56:16,333 --> 00:56:17,416
Why should I?

786
00:56:22,458 --> 00:56:24,041
I wanted to tell you about
my wedding.

787
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:28,875
What do you have in mind?

788
00:56:29,708 --> 00:56:31,583
You put all your strange wishes
before me.

789
00:56:31,958 --> 00:56:34,416
If I ask you why, you would say
who else could fulfil them.

790
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:35,791
After I fulfil them,

791
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:38,208
you ask me
if your husband would like it.

792
00:56:38,833 --> 00:56:41,625
Go to your husband then!

793
00:56:44,041 --> 00:56:46,333
Does drinking this bring
the truth out?

794
00:56:46,541 --> 00:56:48,000
For me it brings out all cuss words.

795
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:01,000
Hey!

796
00:57:06,625 --> 00:57:10,791
Why do I ask you what I should
be asking my husband?

797
00:57:11,125 --> 00:57:12,666
That's what beats me.

798
00:57:15,625 --> 00:57:17,541
How would I make you understand?

799
00:57:19,041 --> 00:57:22,375
I have liked you since I was
this small.

800
00:57:32,958 --> 00:57:38,500
As soon as my dad asked, I came here
not to see the canal or the new bridge.

801
00:57:41,333 --> 00:57:42,333
It was to see you.

802
00:58:07,208 --> 00:58:08,666
Will you marry me, Kishtaiah?

803
00:58:29,250 --> 00:58:36,166
“Further and further…
as distance keeps vanishing”

804
00:58:36,833 --> 00:58:43,833
“Further and further…
as souls keep getting close”

805
00:58:44,708 --> 00:58:52,375
“A strange feeling
peeps into the heart”

806
00:58:52,708 --> 00:58:57,000
“Erasing all silences”

807
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:05,333
“And greeting in words”

808
00:59:07,625 --> 00:59:10,666
“Looking at you…
-Looking at me”

809
00:59:11,375 --> 00:59:14,583
“Wanting to say this…
-Wanting to say…”

810
00:59:15,416 --> 00:59:19,000
“I feel…
-What?”

811
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:26,750
“That past wouldn’t come back
That there is no tomorrow”

812
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:31,916
“That right now I am yours”

813
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,375
Everything seems fine.
What disturbed their love story then?

814
00:59:39,416 --> 00:59:40,458
Exactly!

815
00:59:40,958 --> 00:59:43,625
If all is well, they call it a wedding.
Why would they call it a love story?

816
00:59:45,958 --> 00:59:48,833
Star Ashwini, fourth quarter,
No fault found...

817
00:59:49,083 --> 00:59:49,916
Sir!

818
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,750
Both their horoscopes are
a perfect match.

819
00:59:52,875 --> 00:59:55,041
This is a God chosen wedding.
-Okay!

820
00:59:55,166 --> 00:59:55,875
Ah!

821
01:00:03,541 --> 01:00:04,916
She is beautiful, isn't she?
-Yes!

822
01:00:05,583 --> 01:00:06,458
Hmm.

823
01:00:07,458 --> 01:00:08,958
-Cute, isn't she?
-The bride is beautiful, right?

824
01:00:09,583 --> 01:00:10,333
Come!

825
01:00:11,333 --> 01:00:12,083
Master!

826
01:00:12,875 --> 01:00:15,541
You asked me to bring them
to you when someone likes me.

827
01:00:16,125 --> 01:00:17,375
Here. I have brought her.

828
01:00:34,375 --> 01:00:35,916
Hey, Mahalakshmi!
What is this?

829
01:00:42,166 --> 01:00:47,750
He saved your house and raised
you for years and looked after you...

830
01:00:48,041 --> 01:00:51,583
And how can you eye
his future daughter-in-law?

831
01:00:56,333 --> 01:01:00,250
For being kind to orphans like you,
you have taught him a great lesson.

832
01:01:06,041 --> 01:01:07,750
Hey! Hey! Remove it.
Remove it!

833
01:01:08,458 --> 01:01:10,416
Sir? Why don’t you speak?

834
01:01:10,791 --> 01:01:13,041
Tell him! That she is your
would-be daughter-in-law.

835
01:01:15,916 --> 01:01:17,375
We wanted a wedding.

836
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:19,291
But they are in love.

837
01:01:20,291 --> 01:01:21,708
He is also my family.

838
01:01:24,666 --> 01:01:27,291
If she marries him,
he will take good care of her.

839
01:01:34,750 --> 01:01:35,958
Hey! Varadarajulu…

840
01:01:36,250 --> 01:01:36,958
Hello!

841
01:01:37,375 --> 01:01:40,541
You would probably shelter anyone
and everyone out of compassion.

842
01:01:40,791 --> 01:01:43,208
But I can’t make him my son-in-law
and invite him home.

843
01:01:43,541 --> 01:01:44,416
Damn!

844
01:01:45,583 --> 01:01:46,916
Great job you have done.
Come now!

845
01:01:47,375 --> 01:01:48,333
-Come on!
-Dad!

846
01:01:48,708 --> 01:01:50,166
-Come on now! Come!
-Dad!

847
01:01:50,750 --> 01:01:51,541
Hey!

848
01:02:17,833 --> 01:02:18,583
Hey!

849
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:21,708
When your mother died,
I was only 24.

850
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:26,375
Everyone would come and
ask me, “Marry my daughter.”

851
01:02:26,666 --> 01:02:28,250
I have such status and influence.

852
01:02:28,416 --> 01:02:31,958
But I didn’t relent because a stepmom
could never be your real mom.

853
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:36,083
Being a girl, you cannot express
everything after certain age.

854
01:02:36,166 --> 01:02:37,500
So, I sent you to your grandmother.

855
01:02:39,458 --> 01:02:42,333
Why do you think I collect interest
at the cost of others’ grief?

856
01:02:42,541 --> 01:02:45,041
Because I thought with lakhs,
I can get you a millionaire husband.

857
01:02:45,250 --> 01:02:47,041
And with crores,
I can get you a billionaire.

858
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:49,250
But you choose to go to a hut.

859
01:02:51,875 --> 01:02:54,333
We don’t even know where he
was born and to whom.

860
01:02:56,666 --> 01:02:59,458
What? Do you think I will simply
watch if you try to leave with him?

861
01:02:59,541 --> 01:03:00,291
Huh?

862
01:03:03,083 --> 01:03:04,125
You…

863
01:03:05,166 --> 01:03:06,083
You…

864
01:03:22,375 --> 01:03:23,208
Listen.

865
01:03:23,583 --> 01:03:24,583
Listen, Mahalakshmi!

866
01:03:24,708 --> 01:03:27,583
If you step out of the house,
consider me dead.

867
01:03:29,250 --> 01:03:32,750
Whether you laugh with him,
cry with him or do whatever…

868
01:03:33,041 --> 01:03:34,958
Remember it would all be
over my dead body.

869
01:03:36,416 --> 01:03:37,458
Look, Mahalakshmi!

870
01:03:42,583 --> 01:03:43,375
Dad!

871
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:45,291
Dad!

872
01:03:47,583 --> 01:03:48,333
Dad!

873
01:03:53,791 --> 01:03:54,791
Dad!

874
01:04:00,708 --> 01:04:01,666
Dad!

875
01:04:07,208 --> 01:04:08,333
Dad!

876
01:04:32,791 --> 01:04:34,041
Don’t be sad, Varalu.

877
01:04:34,583 --> 01:04:38,916
Brother will look after you so well
you will forget your dad.

878
01:04:45,375 --> 01:04:50,666
My dad said, if I step across the threshold,
I should consider him dead.

879
01:04:55,291 --> 01:05:00,875
Whether I laugh or cry or do
anything with Kishtaiah,

880
01:05:02,250 --> 01:05:04,708
it would be over my dad’s
dead body.

881
01:05:06,666 --> 01:05:08,041
Don’t overthink, Varalu.

882
01:05:09,791 --> 01:05:10,750
Listen to me.

883
01:05:14,958 --> 01:05:17,833
For just one statement, he has been
Waiting for her for eight years?

884
01:05:18,833 --> 01:05:20,208
He doesn't have to cross
an ocean.

885
01:05:20,625 --> 01:05:22,083
He could just jump over the wall.

886
01:05:22,458 --> 01:05:24,291
Shree Rama may be powerful
Enough to cross the ocean.

887
01:05:24,791 --> 01:05:26,208
But Sita should allow him, right?

888
01:05:28,583 --> 01:05:31,500
We must somehow unite them
before the festival, brother.

889
01:05:33,375 --> 01:05:34,041
Let's go.

890
01:05:55,541 --> 01:05:57,125
Brother-in-law!
I got a rooster ready for the fight.

891
01:06:03,916 --> 01:06:04,791
Sir!

892
01:06:06,625 --> 01:06:09,416
The knife is quite sharp.
Tie it to our fighter cock.

893
01:06:09,625 --> 01:06:10,541
Okay, Sir!

894
01:06:21,083 --> 01:06:25,291
If I find your wheels on our
roads again,

895
01:06:27,416 --> 01:06:29,125
My goodness gracious!

896
01:06:33,333 --> 01:06:36,666
Kishtaiah is arrogant
because of Master's support.

897
01:06:37,416 --> 01:06:38,958
Master is not Kishtaiah’s strength.

898
01:06:39,958 --> 01:06:42,166
Kishtaiah is Master’s strength
and support.

899
01:06:45,250 --> 01:06:49,750
I will show what Veerabhadrudu
can do once he makes up his mind.

900
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:52,625
We don’t have to take the trouble.

901
01:06:53,750 --> 01:06:56,708
Death awaits Krishnaiah at
Master’s house itself.

902
01:06:59,125 --> 01:07:01,458
Do you know what happened
during the last year’s festival?

903
01:07:08,041 --> 01:07:09,166
Hey, smile!

904
01:07:16,666 --> 01:07:18,083
Nice fragrance from perfume…

905
01:07:19,666 --> 01:07:20,458
Do you want it?

906
01:07:20,750 --> 01:07:21,666
Get me one, sir.

907
01:07:22,375 --> 01:07:23,250
This is for you.

908
01:07:23,958 --> 01:07:24,750
Thanks, sir.

909
01:07:27,250 --> 01:07:28,833
Do you know Rambabu?

910
01:07:29,041 --> 01:07:31,333
Yes. Coconut merchant, right?
Yes.

911
01:07:32,166 --> 01:07:33,583
He is my friend.
-Oh!

912
01:07:34,916 --> 01:07:37,666
I have got this for him.

913
01:07:38,416 --> 01:07:39,291
Nice, isn’t it?

914
01:07:39,375 --> 01:07:40,291
Terrific.

915
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:51,916
Hey, Dasu!

916
01:07:53,375 --> 01:07:55,166
Hey, Dasu! How are you?

917
01:07:55,375 --> 01:07:58,208
Have you come directly to
see me from Dubai?

918
01:07:58,750 --> 01:07:59,666
Sit down.

919
01:07:59,750 --> 01:08:00,875
Hey…
-Sir!

920
01:08:01,208 --> 01:08:02,333
- You guys leave.
- Okay, sir!

921
01:08:02,375 --> 01:08:03,166
Leave!

922
01:08:03,583 --> 01:08:05,041
I have got you something.
-Huh?

923
01:08:05,541 --> 01:08:06,458
For me?

924
01:08:09,833 --> 01:08:11,458
Terrific. Just like me.

925
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:12,625
Thanks, man.

926
01:08:15,958 --> 01:08:18,250
It’s been years since your
last visit.

927
01:08:18,375 --> 01:08:20,625
Have you met someone in Dubai?

928
01:08:22,541 --> 01:08:23,708
Get married soon.

929
01:08:23,958 --> 01:08:25,208
You are already greying.

930
01:08:27,416 --> 01:08:29,833
I have two kids already.

931
01:08:30,458 --> 01:08:33,083
I married our classmate, Geeta.

932
01:08:33,416 --> 01:08:36,000
The same Geeta you were after.

933
01:08:42,458 --> 01:08:44,250
Look at your fate, man!

934
01:08:44,541 --> 01:08:46,916
Geeta fell for you,
but I married her.

935
01:08:47,250 --> 01:08:49,750
Your wedding was fixed with Varalu,
but Kishtaiah got in the middle.

936
01:08:56,291 --> 01:08:59,625
When you like someone,
marry her immediately.

937
01:09:00,125 --> 01:09:04,083
Otherwise, someone else will
snatch her… like I did.

938
01:09:06,791 --> 01:09:08,750
But your horoscope is such.

939
01:09:12,041 --> 01:09:14,000
Your horoscope is such.

940
01:09:36,583 --> 01:09:37,791
Look at his horoscope!

941
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,250
Okay. Laugh now…

942
01:09:48,333 --> 01:09:49,958
Come on, laugh! Cheese…

943
01:09:55,958 --> 01:09:58,583
I tried to kill someone in Dubai
for laughing like this...

944
01:10:00,875 --> 01:10:02,458
And they jailed me for
nine years.

945
01:10:05,875 --> 01:10:07,958
That’s why it took me so long
to come here.

946
01:10:11,458 --> 01:10:12,625
You want a smoke?

947
01:10:16,916 --> 01:10:18,166
It doesn't suit you.

948
01:10:26,458 --> 01:10:27,583
Geeta too is mine.

949
01:10:47,666 --> 01:10:50,416
Spray this on your wife. You can
celebrate through the night.

950
01:10:56,250 --> 01:10:58,500
You know...Kishtaiah, right?

951
01:10:58,791 --> 01:11:00,458
Huh! I do, sir.

952
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:02,250
Hmm.

953
01:11:03,458 --> 01:11:04,500
He is also my friend.

954
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:07,791
What is it?

955
01:11:07,875 --> 01:11:09,083
We have reached home.

956
01:11:14,458 --> 01:11:15,625
After how long!

957
01:11:16,416 --> 01:11:17,333
Come!

958
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,041
Bless me, dad!

959
01:11:23,083 --> 01:11:25,166
He hasn't changed a bit, brother.
-Yes!

960
01:11:31,333 --> 01:11:33,083
Hey, had a comfortable journey?
-Hmm.

961
01:11:45,083 --> 01:11:46,541
I heard they didn’t get married?

962
01:11:50,458 --> 01:11:52,000
I mean…Kishtaiah…

963
01:11:53,833 --> 01:11:54,708
and Varalu.

964
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,875
If she didn’t marry him for
nine years,

965
01:12:00,208 --> 01:12:01,708
it means she won’t marry
him, right?

966
01:12:02,708 --> 01:12:03,958
Why don’t you ask her once?

967
01:12:04,583 --> 01:12:05,708
If she would marry me.

968
01:12:06,083 --> 01:12:08,416
That’s a wrong question
to ask someone’s wife.

969
01:12:09,916 --> 01:12:10,750
But why?

970
01:12:11,125 --> 01:12:12,458
They said they are not married.

971
01:12:13,083 --> 01:12:16,750
Whether they are married or not…
though they live in different houses...

972
01:12:17,125 --> 01:12:18,250
He is her husband.

973
01:12:19,250 --> 01:12:20,291
She is his wife.

974
01:12:35,041 --> 01:12:36,333
Mom!
-Huh?

975
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:40,125
Have this vada, it’s hot.
-I don’t want it.

976
01:12:41,250 --> 01:12:43,083
Pass me the kitchen knife once.
-Huh?

977
01:12:43,958 --> 01:12:45,875
Why do you want a kitchen knife?
-Give it here, mom.

978
01:12:46,208 --> 01:12:47,083
Oho...

979
01:12:49,541 --> 01:12:50,375
Here!

980
01:13:10,333 --> 01:13:12,750
Hey, hey, stop him.

981
01:13:13,875 --> 01:13:15,458
Hey, hey, Dasu!

982
01:13:15,541 --> 01:13:16,708
What is the kitchen knife for?

983
01:13:16,833 --> 01:13:17,875
Do you want to kill dad?

984
01:13:17,958 --> 01:13:21,000
Bloody! Why does he teach me
morals about Kishtaiah?

985
01:13:21,083 --> 01:13:23,083
Hey, it’s our dad!
That’s wrong.

986
01:13:23,625 --> 01:13:24,916
You call him dad? Ptui!

987
01:13:25,125 --> 01:13:26,875
Do you know the humiliation
I face because of him?

988
01:13:27,958 --> 01:13:28,833
Hey, Dasu!

989
01:13:29,041 --> 01:13:29,958
Dasu!

990
01:13:30,041 --> 01:13:32,000
What's the point in getting
angry with dad?

991
01:13:32,750 --> 01:13:35,333
Look!
It's the girl that you want, right?

992
01:13:35,416 --> 01:13:36,916
She is not married yet.

993
01:13:37,250 --> 01:13:38,125
Marry her.

994
01:13:38,833 --> 01:13:40,333
Do whatever you want.

995
01:13:40,875 --> 01:13:41,708
Hmm!

996
01:14:17,708 --> 01:14:18,416
Huh?

997
01:14:19,791 --> 01:14:20,916
Who the heck are you?

998
01:14:23,208 --> 01:14:24,041
Me?

999
01:14:24,541 --> 01:14:25,791
Huh? It’s Dasu!

1000
01:14:26,916 --> 01:14:30,083
Someone entitled to see
your beauty long ago!

1001
01:14:30,458 --> 01:14:33,125
If you don’t leave right now,
I will make mincemeat of you.

1002
01:14:35,791 --> 01:14:36,750
It’s because of this.

1003
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,958
It’s because of this that you
spotted me.

1004
01:14:43,416 --> 01:14:44,375
Do one thing, Varalu.

1005
01:14:44,958 --> 01:14:47,708
Imagine I am not here and start
from the beginning.

1006
01:14:47,791 --> 01:14:48,500
Ah!
-Huh?

1007
01:14:48,583 --> 01:14:52,125
I will hide myself right here.
Okay?

1008
01:15:36,208 --> 01:15:37,083
Damn!

1009
01:15:56,041 --> 01:15:56,791
Hey!

1010
01:16:11,875 --> 01:16:12,583
Ugh!

1011
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:37,458
You...

1012
01:16:51,791 --> 01:16:53,083
Hey, Anji! Stop!
It is Mr Dasu.

1013
01:16:53,250 --> 01:16:54,166
It’s master’s youngest son.

1014
01:16:54,208 --> 01:16:55,291
Who cares who he is?

1015
01:16:55,416 --> 01:16:56,333
This bloody rogue...

1016
01:16:57,166 --> 01:16:58,458
Stop!
-Don’t do it.

1017
01:16:58,625 --> 01:16:59,583
Hey, hey, hey!

1018
01:16:59,666 --> 01:17:00,500
Hey!

1019
01:17:00,625 --> 01:17:01,500
Hey Anji!

1020
01:17:13,458 --> 01:17:14,291
Come on!

1021
01:17:37,541 --> 01:17:38,791
Hey, Dasu!
-Hey!

1022
01:17:38,916 --> 01:17:40,250
What happened?
-What happened?

1023
01:17:46,791 --> 01:17:47,833
Hey!

1024
01:18:18,041 --> 01:18:18,750
Finish him!

1025
01:18:43,750 --> 01:18:44,625
Husband!

1026
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:47,916
Hey, Dasu!

1027
01:18:55,416 --> 01:18:56,291
Hey…

1028
01:18:56,333 --> 01:18:57,875
Kishtaiah!

1029
01:19:11,125 --> 01:19:12,083
Go, man!

1030
01:19:41,333 --> 01:19:44,333
"My goodness gracious"

1031
01:19:45,333 --> 01:19:46,666
Hey!
-Hey!

1032
01:19:58,583 --> 01:20:01,000
"My goodness gracious"

1033
01:20:01,458 --> 01:20:02,541
Mom!
-Hey!

1034
01:20:23,041 --> 01:20:26,041
Hey, Hey! Anji! Anji!
Hey, stop it. Stop it.

1035
01:20:26,083 --> 01:20:27,375
I will see his end.
-Anji…

1036
01:20:28,333 --> 01:20:29,708
He is our master’s son.
Leave him.

1037
01:20:29,750 --> 01:20:31,041
Do you know what he did?

1038
01:20:31,208 --> 01:20:32,125
What did he do?

1039
01:20:42,791 --> 01:20:44,000
Nothing. Let's go.

1040
01:20:44,625 --> 01:20:46,041
Someday I will get hold of him.
-Fine. Let's go.

1041
01:20:46,333 --> 01:20:47,250
Stop…
-Hey...

1042
01:20:48,125 --> 01:20:49,041
Hey…

1043
01:20:49,291 --> 01:20:50,166
Hey!

1044
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:58,875
Hey, Kishtaiah, stop it.
Stop, Kishtaiah. Stop. Kishtaiah, stop!

1045
01:20:59,666 --> 01:21:01,416
Hey, stop!
-Hey, stop Dasu.

1046
01:21:05,333 --> 01:21:07,583
I don’t know about these two.

1047
01:21:07,750 --> 01:21:10,000
But if I don’t kill you both
by next festival...

1048
01:21:13,583 --> 01:21:15,083
I am not my dad’s son.

1049
01:21:42,583 --> 01:21:43,375
Hey!

1050
01:21:44,125 --> 01:21:45,958
You kicked Anji on his chest.

1051
01:21:46,333 --> 01:21:50,208
And yet if you are alive,
it's because you are Master's son.

1052
01:21:51,250 --> 01:21:53,250
Or else, before this festival itself…

1053
01:21:53,875 --> 01:21:55,291
My goodness gracious!

1054
01:22:24,916 --> 01:22:29,041
As if last year's ruckus wasn't
enough, Das is back in the village.

1055
01:22:29,250 --> 01:22:32,750
The bonfire made every Pongal
dies down by evening.

1056
01:22:32,875 --> 01:22:35,958
But Dasu has been burning
for a year.

1057
01:22:36,041 --> 01:22:38,750
If he were not master’s son,
he would have died a year ago.

1058
01:22:38,791 --> 01:22:39,500
I know…

1059
01:22:39,583 --> 01:22:40,291
Who knows?

1060
01:22:40,375 --> 01:22:42,583
Big people have a lot of money.
They are capable of anything.

1061
01:22:48,625 --> 01:22:49,791
What's wrong with him?

1062
01:22:51,250 --> 01:22:51,958
Aunt!

1063
01:22:52,041 --> 01:22:53,416
There he goes.
-Why is he like that?

1064
01:22:56,416 --> 01:22:57,708
How is your Kishtaiah doing?

1065
01:22:58,541 --> 01:23:00,041
I told you not to come.

1066
01:23:00,625 --> 01:23:01,541
Why did you still come?

1067
01:23:02,458 --> 01:23:05,750
I have come to give him
a huge gift for his wedding.

1068
01:23:06,458 --> 01:23:07,125
Huh!

1069
01:23:32,166 --> 01:23:34,166
Why is the little one’s face fallen?

1070
01:23:34,333 --> 01:23:35,166
Look at him, brother.

1071
01:23:35,250 --> 01:23:37,166
I have been asking him to buy
her clothes for the festival.

1072
01:23:37,625 --> 01:23:39,000
But he wouldn’t respond.

1073
01:23:39,583 --> 01:23:41,708
I wonder if he would buy at least
for the chariot festival.

1074
01:23:43,708 --> 01:23:44,458
What, man?

1075
01:23:46,958 --> 01:23:47,625
Sinni!

1076
01:23:48,291 --> 01:23:49,916
Let’s go shopping. Come.

1077
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:50,791
Don’t, brother.

1078
01:23:51,083 --> 01:23:52,583
If you take her and buy her
a frock,

1079
01:23:52,625 --> 01:23:54,875
both of them will have a ball
with me until the next festival.

1080
01:23:55,083 --> 01:23:56,916
Once these sweets are ready, I’ll
go buy the clothes myself, brother.

1081
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:58,875
Tsk! Hey!

1082
01:23:59,833 --> 01:24:02,000
Decide which of you would
call me brother.

1083
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,041
Come, dear.
Let us go, buy mango jelly.

1084
01:24:28,458 --> 01:24:29,333
You had it good.

1085
01:24:54,291 --> 01:24:56,541
Hey! Who is that?
What are you doing?

1086
01:24:56,625 --> 01:24:57,625
-Husband!
-Stop!

1087
01:24:57,791 --> 01:24:58,625
Stop!

1088
01:25:01,708 --> 01:25:03,291
What is this inauspicious incident
on a festival day?

1089
01:25:03,375 --> 01:25:04,833
Hey, why do you cry?

1090
01:25:05,541 --> 01:25:07,833
Which man in this village is macho
enough to put us on the bier?

1091
01:25:12,541 --> 01:25:13,250
Hey!

1092
01:25:13,708 --> 01:25:15,458
Why did you send biers
to Kishtaiah’s house?

1093
01:25:15,916 --> 01:25:17,458
Have you lost your mind?
Huh?

1094
01:25:17,583 --> 01:25:20,041
He beat up your youngest son
last festival. Don’t you remember?

1095
01:25:20,375 --> 01:25:22,375
You only talk about Kishtaiah
beating him.

1096
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:24,791
Has he told you what he had
done yet?

1097
01:25:24,916 --> 01:25:25,833
I'll tell you. I'll tell you.

1098
01:25:25,916 --> 01:25:27,833
I am not sure whether we are
your sons or they are.

1099
01:25:28,125 --> 01:25:29,375
A hen is much better than you.

1100
01:25:29,916 --> 01:25:32,416
If someone goes near her chicks,
it pokes them to death.

1101
01:25:32,916 --> 01:25:34,625
He is the rooster who
protects us.

1102
01:25:38,166 --> 01:25:40,041
I know our own roosters
won't work.

1103
01:25:40,958 --> 01:25:42,458
So, I am getting hunting dogs
from jail.

1104
01:25:46,041 --> 01:25:47,625
They don't hear your
rooster's name.

1105
01:25:48,250 --> 01:25:49,666
They only see its head.

1106
01:25:54,041 --> 01:25:56,958
Cut throat criminals who
slit throats and drink the blood.

1107
01:26:14,250 --> 01:26:15,708
Greetings, sir.
-Ah…!

1108
01:26:23,958 --> 01:26:25,791
Anji and Kishtaiah...

1109
01:26:29,250 --> 01:26:30,791
I will talk to my boys
and get back to you.

1110
01:26:30,958 --> 01:26:31,625
Hmm.

1111
01:26:53,166 --> 01:26:55,708
We have to go past Kishtaiah
to kill Anji.

1112
01:26:56,833 --> 01:26:57,791
That is tough enough.

1113
01:26:58,625 --> 01:27:01,583
To kill Kishtaiah is walking
to death.

1114
01:27:05,375 --> 01:27:08,000
Kishtaiah is a life size weapon
and who can stop him?

1115
01:27:10,875 --> 01:27:11,916
It’s very difficult.

1116
01:27:15,375 --> 01:27:17,125
You better drop this idea too.

1117
01:27:17,958 --> 01:27:18,916
We take leave.

1118
01:27:26,166 --> 01:27:27,625
Who do you think he is?

1119
01:27:28,208 --> 01:27:29,250
Kishtaiah!

1120
01:27:34,875 --> 01:27:35,666
Damn!

1121
01:27:40,083 --> 01:27:41,875
Hey, Subbaiah…
-Yes, Kishtaiah…

1122
01:27:41,916 --> 01:27:43,541
A festival is all about chicken curry-
-Hmm.

1123
01:27:43,625 --> 01:27:45,333
Vada and a bottle of drink.

1124
01:27:45,833 --> 01:27:46,458
Of course.

1125
01:27:46,541 --> 01:27:47,583
Where is your drink?
-Kishtaiah!

1126
01:27:47,625 --> 01:27:48,458
I finished it long ago.

1127
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:50,291
He has sent biers home, Kishtaiah.
-Hmm.

1128
01:27:51,375 --> 01:27:52,833
Hey, what is this nuisance?

1129
01:27:53,166 --> 01:27:54,708
Kishtaiah, they sent home biers.

1130
01:27:55,583 --> 01:27:57,125
Then tell me...what shall we do?

1131
01:27:57,416 --> 01:27:58,375
Let's take a sip.

1132
01:27:58,458 --> 01:28:00,875
Then uncap the bottle.

1133
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:02,208
Yay!

1134
01:28:09,416 --> 01:28:12,541
“When the girl gives you a nod
-and the love track takes off”

1135
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:16,333
“When the monthly salary at rice mill
-gets a hike that’s unexpectedly high”

1136
01:28:16,583 --> 01:28:19,000
“When your favourite hero’s
film…”

1137
01:28:20,083 --> 01:28:22,458
“Runs house full”

1138
01:28:23,791 --> 01:28:25,625
“When India…
-Clinches the cup”

1139
01:28:25,833 --> 01:28:27,458
“And the wife...
-makes a compromise”

1140
01:28:27,708 --> 01:28:29,958
“When your neighbour runs
into loss..."

1141
01:28:30,833 --> 01:28:33,666
"and you get a chance to
wipe his tears”

1142
01:28:34,416 --> 01:28:37,916
“What should we do?
-Uncap the bottle”

1143
01:28:38,166 --> 01:28:41,541
“What should we do”
-Uncap the bottle”

1144
01:28:41,791 --> 01:28:45,291
“Do take a sip
and a sip after sip”

1145
01:28:46,041 --> 01:28:49,458
“When you are bored, try beer
when you are pained, try brandy”

1146
01:28:49,708 --> 01:28:55,041
“When you are vexed, have whisky,
when mood is out, drink all the three”

1147
01:28:55,291 --> 01:28:58,625
“With your wife, down the toddy
With your brothers, have some gin”

1148
01:28:58,833 --> 01:29:02,125
“Whoever calls you bro,
Have a drink mixed in soda”

1149
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:05,750
“Whoever is close to you
always have it raw”

1150
01:29:06,250 --> 01:29:09,000
“When someone older than
you comes”

1151
01:29:09,916 --> 01:29:12,875
“Butter up but drink in secret”

1152
01:29:13,625 --> 01:29:17,166
“The first peg makes you
feel intoxicated”

1153
01:29:17,458 --> 01:29:20,708
“With the second peg,
your body begins to float”

1154
01:29:21,083 --> 01:29:25,083
“When the third, fourth and
fifth pegs go down the throat”

1155
01:29:26,375 --> 01:29:27,791
“My goodness gracious”

1156
01:29:28,458 --> 01:29:30,750
“Strange things happen”

1157
01:29:31,125 --> 01:29:32,458
“My goodness gracious”

1158
01:29:33,041 --> 01:29:36,458
“The kitten in the backyard
begins to say bow-wow”

1159
01:29:36,791 --> 01:29:40,166
“The fish in the well is
found smoking cigar”

1160
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:43,958
“The fan in your hand looks like
a piece of chicken”

1161
01:29:44,208 --> 01:29:47,750
“The grinding stone in the corner
becomes a plate of silver”

1162
01:29:47,958 --> 01:29:51,333
“Ninety rupee note slips
from your pocket"

1163
01:29:51,583 --> 01:29:55,000
"The checkered lungi on you,
becomes a shirt”

1164
01:29:55,208 --> 01:29:59,125
“Grandpa dead a year ago
appears and…”

1165
01:30:00,708 --> 01:30:04,291
“Hey, boy! Aren’t you eating?
Not drinking anything?”

1166
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:07,583
“You have gone so thin!
What is happening?”

1167
01:30:07,958 --> 01:30:09,916
“He greets you thus”

1168
01:30:11,291 --> 01:30:13,708
“And warns you with love”

1169
01:30:15,291 --> 01:30:19,041
“The guy who invented liquor,
Wherever he is…”

1170
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:24,250
“Hey, the guy who invented liquor
Wherever he is…”

1171
01:30:24,541 --> 01:30:28,291
“To his eyes, nose, and ears
to his feet, mouth and arms”

1172
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:31,375
“I bow in respect…
-Hey, we bow in respect”

1173
01:30:31,750 --> 01:30:35,041
“What should we do?
-Uncap the bottle”

1174
01:30:35,291 --> 01:30:38,708
“What should we do?”
-Uncap the bottle”

1175
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:42,458
“Do take a sip
and a sip after sip”

1176
01:30:42,708 --> 01:30:46,375
“Do take a sip
and a sip after sip”

1177
01:30:50,666 --> 01:30:53,958
For me, for me, Kishtaiah!
Kishtaiah, for me.

1178
01:30:54,125 --> 01:30:55,041
Hey…

1179
01:30:58,583 --> 01:31:00,041
Brother…
-Hmm.

1180
01:31:01,250 --> 01:31:02,958
I have a doubt.
-What is it?

1181
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:08,000
How would Kishtaiah and Varalu
know about each other every day?

1182
01:31:09,375 --> 01:31:12,791
Like Narada in the Puranas,
there is someone here.

1183
01:31:12,833 --> 01:31:14,000
Who is it?
-It’s me!

1184
01:31:14,083 --> 01:31:15,541
Oh, no! Oh, no! How nasty!

1185
01:31:15,666 --> 01:31:17,583
Get up! Get up. Take it off.

1186
01:31:17,958 --> 01:31:19,333
Remove it from here. Up!

1187
01:31:19,750 --> 01:31:21,625
Hey, don’t you understand?
-What is your problem?

1188
01:31:21,875 --> 01:31:24,208
Remove this crap and throw it
into fire. Make it fast!

1189
01:31:29,708 --> 01:31:31,916
Brother…I have another doubt.
-What?

1190
01:31:32,208 --> 01:31:34,166
How is Varalu able to live alone
for eight years?

1191
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:35,375
What could she do?

1192
01:31:35,750 --> 01:31:39,250
Unable to stay alone at home,
she prays to God in the morning.

1193
01:31:40,208 --> 01:31:41,916
She cooks rice in the afternoon.

1194
01:31:42,750 --> 01:31:43,833
And at night…

1195
01:31:49,541 --> 01:31:50,833
She serves me drinks like this.

1196
01:31:51,958 --> 01:31:52,708
Hmm.

1197
01:31:53,625 --> 01:31:55,375
Here…
Manga has sent this for you.

1198
01:32:00,625 --> 01:32:02,625
What is he up to?
Your brother?

1199
01:32:02,875 --> 01:32:05,291
Only yesterday, he beat 20 guys
to pulp in the mango grove.

1200
01:32:05,958 --> 01:32:08,000
Does he feel he is still young?

1201
01:32:08,250 --> 01:32:09,333
Ask him to slow down.

1202
01:32:09,583 --> 01:32:10,416
Why should he?

1203
01:32:10,458 --> 01:32:11,583
Kishtaiah is ever green.

1204
01:32:13,916 --> 01:32:16,250
How can you praise him
sipping at my drink?

1205
01:32:17,833 --> 01:32:20,375
If you want to praise him,
keep the glass down.

1206
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,416
Were the injuries too bad?

1207
01:32:30,958 --> 01:32:33,666
Why do you stare without
answering?

1208
01:32:34,458 --> 01:32:35,583
Attend to that, first.

1209
01:32:39,541 --> 01:32:40,500
No injuries for my brother.

1210
01:32:40,625 --> 01:32:41,875
They had very bad injuries.

1211
01:32:42,666 --> 01:32:44,166
Who did you think I was
asking about?

1212
01:32:45,750 --> 01:32:46,750
Who is this boy?

1213
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:48,541
He's Bhaskar.
One of my boys.

1214
01:32:48,666 --> 01:32:50,625
He is in love with president’s
daughter from the other village.

1215
01:32:50,833 --> 01:32:52,083
Yesterday’s fight was about
this guy.

1216
01:32:52,250 --> 01:32:53,916
Master has left him with us
for safety.

1217
01:32:54,250 --> 01:32:54,958
What now?

1218
01:32:55,166 --> 01:32:57,833
If something happens to this boy,
your macho man is going to save him?

1219
01:32:58,166 --> 01:32:59,041
What do you think?

1220
01:32:59,250 --> 01:33:01,166
Who is man enough to
beat Kishtaiah?

1221
01:33:03,166 --> 01:33:03,958
By the way…

1222
01:33:04,041 --> 01:33:05,208
I noticed it the other day…

1223
01:33:06,125 --> 01:33:09,000
Has his hair gone a bit grey?
Your brother’s?

1224
01:33:09,208 --> 01:33:10,958
I have been telling him, Varalu,
to colour his hair.

1225
01:33:11,041 --> 01:33:12,500
Hey! He looks better this way.

1226
01:33:15,708 --> 01:33:16,458
Keep it.

1227
01:33:20,250 --> 01:33:23,083
When you love him so much,
why don’t you marry him?

1228
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:41,208
This bloody old...

1229
01:33:43,500 --> 01:33:44,208
That’s it.

1230
01:33:44,333 --> 01:33:47,333
Every evening…she serves me drinks
and keeps asking about my brother.

1231
01:33:47,625 --> 01:33:48,791
If I praise him, she scolds me.

1232
01:33:48,916 --> 01:33:50,041
If I say nothing, she sulks.

1233
01:33:50,625 --> 01:33:51,791
What about brother?

1234
01:33:54,916 --> 01:33:55,833
Let's go. I'll tell you.

1235
01:33:57,416 --> 01:33:58,250
Look there.

1236
01:33:59,250 --> 01:34:00,666
Watch our hero make his entry.

1237
01:34:05,958 --> 01:34:08,666
At the same time, the heroine
also steps out. Watch.

1238
01:34:12,416 --> 01:34:14,625
He will send a whiff of smoke
in her direction.

1239
01:34:18,875 --> 01:34:22,000
Watch our heroine's hair wave
because of the smoke.

1240
01:34:29,333 --> 01:34:31,541
A whole day of wait for a moment
of looking at each other?

1241
01:34:32,375 --> 01:34:33,500
A moment is not enough.

1242
01:34:33,916 --> 01:34:35,583
That’s why she grooms pigeons.
-What are the pigeons for?

1243
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:37,458
To make our guy look at
her longer,

1244
01:34:37,750 --> 01:34:40,125
she wakes up the sleeping
pigeons and feeds them.

1245
01:34:40,333 --> 01:34:41,250
Great lady!

1246
01:34:43,625 --> 01:34:45,666
They are just pigeons with tiny
stomachs. How much can they eat?

1247
01:34:46,083 --> 01:34:50,541
That’s why… she pours two pegs for
the plants just like she offers to me.

1248
01:34:50,708 --> 01:34:57,208
“Further and further…
as distance keeps vanishing”

1249
01:34:58,333 --> 01:35:00,833
She will unlock the gate and relock.

1250
01:35:00,916 --> 01:35:04,833
“Further and further…
as souls keep coming close”

1251
01:35:06,125 --> 01:35:13,166
“A strange feeling
peeps into the heart”

1252
01:35:13,833 --> 01:35:18,458
“Erasing all silences”

1253
01:35:19,250 --> 01:35:20,041
That’s all.

1254
01:35:20,458 --> 01:35:22,083
When it’s night, we go for a drink.

1255
01:35:22,416 --> 01:35:23,958
But their story doesn’t
move ahead.

1256
01:35:24,333 --> 01:35:26,000
They are just a call away.
-“And greeting in words”

1257
01:35:26,541 --> 01:35:28,125
But it’s been ten years
since the call was heard.

1258
01:35:29,250 --> 01:35:31,458
"Looking at you..."
-They pretend to be happy.

1259
01:35:31,541 --> 01:35:33,958
"looking at me..." -But they go through
hell within. Wanting to say this..."

1260
01:35:34,791 --> 01:35:36,541
"Wanting to say..."
Come. Let’s go.

1261
01:35:36,791 --> 01:35:38,833
“It makes me feel…”

1262
01:35:39,208 --> 01:35:40,750
“What?”

1263
01:35:41,125 --> 01:35:48,000
“That past wouldn’t come back
That there is no tomorrow”

1264
01:35:48,708 --> 01:35:53,541
“That right now I am yours”

1265
01:35:56,666 --> 01:36:03,750
“That past wouldn’t come back
That there is no tomorrow”

1266
01:36:04,333 --> 01:36:09,291
“That right now I am yours”

1267
01:36:12,625 --> 01:36:13,541
Why are you here?

1268
01:36:13,708 --> 01:36:15,375
I felt like seeing you.

1269
01:36:17,541 --> 01:36:19,583
You saw me when I was
locking the gate.

1270
01:36:19,875 --> 01:36:20,750
Not enough?

1271
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:22,375
What?

1272
01:36:22,500 --> 01:36:25,375
My life is here and what would
I do on the other side of the wall?

1273
01:36:25,541 --> 01:36:26,458
Hmm!

1274
01:36:26,541 --> 01:36:28,125
Enough with your sweet talk.

1275
01:36:28,583 --> 01:36:29,666
Hey! Come here.

1276
01:36:33,291 --> 01:36:40,375
“That past wouldn’t come back
That there is no tomorrow”

1277
01:36:40,958 --> 01:36:47,166
“That right now I am yours”

1278
01:36:55,375 --> 01:36:57,166
What curry is this? Murrel?

1279
01:36:58,833 --> 01:36:59,958
Hey, Varalu!

1280
01:37:00,458 --> 01:37:02,541
Wear some short clothes
just once.

1281
01:37:05,958 --> 01:37:07,166
You deserve a good lesson.

1282
01:37:11,083 --> 01:37:11,875
You!

1283
01:37:14,500 --> 01:37:15,625
Hey. Come here.

1284
01:37:31,416 --> 01:37:32,791
Are you not going to change ever?

1285
01:37:33,666 --> 01:37:35,750
The tree before your house
has changed.

1286
01:37:35,833 --> 01:37:36,916
This village has changed.

1287
01:37:37,125 --> 01:37:39,416
Even Anji has a daughter
and his life has changed.

1288
01:37:41,333 --> 01:37:42,333
Give it a thought.

1289
01:37:43,500 --> 01:37:45,250
May be your dad would be
born as our kid.

1290
01:38:00,208 --> 01:38:02,208
Do you want me to have a couple
of cardamoms and come?

1291
01:38:02,291 --> 01:38:03,166
Hmm?

1292
01:38:03,875 --> 01:38:04,833
You…

1293
01:38:05,083 --> 01:38:06,583
I am going to kill you!
Stop there!

1294
01:38:45,375 --> 01:38:46,208
Kumari...

1295
01:38:46,958 --> 01:38:48,541
Kumari! Look here once.

1296
01:38:50,541 --> 01:38:53,500
Don't look at me like that.
Like a gaff fitted fighter cock...

1297
01:38:53,666 --> 01:38:54,750
I will get slashed.

1298
01:38:55,833 --> 01:38:57,000
Why are you going away?

1299
01:38:59,583 --> 01:39:01,541
But uncle's upbringing
is commendable.

1300
01:39:02,291 --> 01:39:05,375
Fish in the pond and daughter at home...
See, how systematically he raised both!

1301
01:39:05,875 --> 01:39:06,708
Hey, brother!

1302
01:39:07,083 --> 01:39:09,916
When are you sending your daughter
to my house as my daughter-in- law?

1303
01:39:10,208 --> 01:39:12,500
When she was born, I never
thought a daughter was born.

1304
01:39:13,625 --> 01:39:15,291
I thought your daughter-in-law
was born.

1305
01:39:18,125 --> 01:39:18,916
Dad...

1306
01:39:20,041 --> 01:39:22,083
Bhasker and I...

1307
01:39:28,333 --> 01:39:32,500
Another word from you and
I will throttle you to death.

1308
01:39:33,375 --> 01:39:37,000
As a dad who killed his own daughter
for falling in love with the enemy...

1309
01:39:37,625 --> 01:39:39,125
my reputation will be intact.

1310
01:39:39,875 --> 01:39:41,666
What’s the point in throttling
her neck now?

1311
01:39:41,750 --> 01:39:43,250
You don't know how to take care of
shrimplets that reached count stage

1312
01:39:43,333 --> 01:39:45,125
or girls who have come of age.

1313
01:39:46,125 --> 01:39:48,625
When she went out smiling
wearing flowers, I knew...

1314
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:50,916
That she was going to make
a fool of you and me.

1315
01:39:52,083 --> 01:39:53,750
Hey! What is your confidence?

1316
01:39:53,875 --> 01:39:55,250
That Kishtaiah would come
to the rescue?

1317
01:39:55,833 --> 01:39:57,458
Tomorrow is the chariot festival.

1318
01:39:58,041 --> 01:40:01,583
They have to bring their chariot
to our village as per tradition.

1319
01:40:02,583 --> 01:40:06,125
As long as that village supports
your love,

1320
01:40:07,083 --> 01:40:10,791
so long I shall obstruct
those chariots..

1321
01:40:11,333 --> 01:40:13,750
If I don't, stop calling me
Jakkannakota Veerabhadrudu.

1322
01:40:16,916 --> 01:40:18,083
Greetings, Sir!

1323
01:40:21,500 --> 01:40:24,666
Every Kanuma, the tradition of
carrying chariots to Jaggannathota

1324
01:40:24,750 --> 01:40:26,500
has been in vogue for 400 years.

1325
01:40:26,916 --> 01:40:30,333
Twenty five years ago when it stopped,
entire village was swept away by floods.

1326
01:40:30,750 --> 01:40:32,916
Let us not mess with God, master.

1327
01:40:33,333 --> 01:40:34,416
Yes, sir!

1328
01:40:34,500 --> 01:40:37,833
This is like two bulls fighting
and crushing a calf by the side.

1329
01:40:38,375 --> 01:40:40,791
As this Bhaskar is in love with
Veerabhadrudu's daughter,

1330
01:40:40,875 --> 01:40:43,000
should the whole village pay
the price?

1331
01:40:44,083 --> 01:40:45,083
No point in blaming him.

1332
01:40:45,333 --> 01:40:46,666
Blame the person protecting him.

1333
01:40:50,291 --> 01:40:51,791
This village is like a mother to me.

1334
01:40:52,291 --> 01:40:56,291
If Injustice is done to the village
or Master is humiliated,

1335
01:40:56,625 --> 01:40:58,500
consider Kishtaiah dead that
very moment.

1336
01:41:01,041 --> 01:41:02,666
Kishtaiah makes you all a promise.

1337
01:41:03,083 --> 01:41:06,000
If they block our chariots from
going through Jaggannathota...

1338
01:41:06,583 --> 01:41:07,750
My goodness gracious!

1339
01:41:08,125 --> 01:41:11,333
It's not a river that our Lord Shiva
would cross. But, a river of blood!

1340
01:41:13,916 --> 01:41:15,333
Why should we get into
a fight, sir?

1341
01:41:16,083 --> 01:41:18,000
Collector sir has come to
Amalapuram.

1342
01:41:18,208 --> 01:41:20,416
Let us settle this before
the Collector.

1343
01:41:21,291 --> 01:41:22,166
Hmm.

1344
01:41:22,791 --> 01:41:24,208
Hey!
-Hey!

1345
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:34,791
Hey!

1346
01:41:40,625 --> 01:41:42,458
You tell me Mr Peddaiah.
What is the issue?

1347
01:41:42,541 --> 01:41:44,583
Collector sir,
how is he a gentleman?

1348
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,791
He is protecting the guy
who had jumped over my wall.

1349
01:41:47,833 --> 01:41:48,583
Hey,

1350
01:41:48,833 --> 01:41:51,541
if you blabber as you like,
I will cut off your tongue.

1351
01:41:53,291 --> 01:41:55,625
Put an end to this and let
the chariots pass through.

1352
01:41:55,666 --> 01:41:56,958
Huh?
What if we don't allow them?

1353
01:41:57,041 --> 01:41:58,208
What would you do? Huh?

1354
01:41:58,291 --> 01:41:59,791
If you don’t allow them what I…
-Kishtaiah.

1355
01:42:00,750 --> 01:42:03,916
When the procession was stopped
25 years ago there were disastrous floods.

1356
01:42:04,166 --> 01:42:05,583
And it is still discussed in
our village.

1357
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:09,083
This time, your village would
remember that Kishtaiah came.

1358
01:42:12,333 --> 01:42:13,208
Collector Sir,

1359
01:42:13,458 --> 01:42:15,916
Bhaskar is well educated and
a good boy.

1360
01:42:16,291 --> 01:42:17,750
That's why we are supporting him.

1361
01:42:17,958 --> 01:42:20,666
Hey! If you find him so good,
send him a girl from your family!

1362
01:42:21,708 --> 01:42:22,416
Hey,

1363
01:42:22,708 --> 01:42:24,708
I'll hack you down
if you cross your line.

1364
01:42:24,833 --> 01:42:26,750
You think we’re cowards?
-Hey, you think you can hack away?

1365
01:42:26,791 --> 01:42:29,083
And we will sit watching you do it?
Come on!

1366
01:42:29,166 --> 01:42:30,625
Hey!
-Come, let’s have it out.

1367
01:42:30,708 --> 01:42:31,833
Hey, stop it.

1368
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:32,875
Hey SI,

1369
01:42:33,583 --> 01:42:35,000
this is an issue related to
our two villages.

1370
01:42:35,125 --> 01:42:36,958
You have nothing to do here.
Get going.

1371
01:42:37,250 --> 01:42:38,416
Stop! Stop!

1372
01:42:38,750 --> 01:42:41,208
If it was a fight you wanted,
why did you even come to me?

1373
01:42:42,250 --> 01:42:43,791
Mr Veerabhadrudu, you tell me.

1374
01:42:43,833 --> 01:42:45,750
To allow the procession through
your village, what are your conditions?

1375
01:42:45,791 --> 01:42:46,625
Collector sir,

1376
01:42:46,875 --> 01:42:48,791
there's tradition in
both our villages.

1377
01:42:49,541 --> 01:42:51,541
Whoever commits a mistake
in either of our villages,

1378
01:42:51,916 --> 01:42:53,583
the culprit's supporter...

1379
01:42:57,666 --> 01:43:00,666
...must fall at the feet of the other
Person and ask for his forgiveness.

1380
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:02,166
You decide now...

1381
01:43:03,375 --> 01:43:05,583
Who should come forward
to touch whose feet...

1382
01:43:10,791 --> 01:43:11,666
Collector sir,

1383
01:43:12,375 --> 01:43:14,083
I understand their intention.

1384
01:43:15,791 --> 01:43:19,291
I’m ready to do anything for
the village.

1385
01:43:21,333 --> 01:43:24,166
Master, how can you touch
his feet?

1386
01:43:24,541 --> 01:43:26,083
He doesn't have to do that.

1387
01:43:26,708 --> 01:43:28,250
You stand in support of
your village.

1388
01:43:28,666 --> 01:43:30,166
You can come instead and do it.

1389
01:43:30,291 --> 01:43:31,625
Hey!

1390
01:43:37,083 --> 01:43:38,083
Come, come on!

1391
01:43:41,166 --> 01:43:42,708
Come, come on!

1392
01:43:42,875 --> 01:43:43,750
Yay!

1393
01:44:11,625 --> 01:44:13,208
Brother, the job you assigned
is done.

1394
01:44:13,458 --> 01:44:14,708
Otherwise we will be blamed.

1395
01:44:17,583 --> 01:44:18,375
Move!

1396
01:44:18,791 --> 01:44:21,750
Uncle! Kumari has run away
with that Bhaskar.

1397
01:44:22,500 --> 01:44:24,458
If your daughter herself has left,
you can't find fault with them.

1398
01:44:40,625 --> 01:44:42,625
Hey, did you expect us to
touch your feet?

1399
01:44:43,333 --> 01:44:45,791
I'll make you wash the feet
of the boy from our village.

1400
01:44:46,666 --> 01:44:48,166
And what sort of president
are you?

1401
01:44:48,750 --> 01:44:51,916
This could be resolved between us
but you involve the village and God!

1402
01:44:52,458 --> 01:44:53,458
Mr Collector!

1403
01:44:54,541 --> 01:44:58,583
Our chariots will go to his village
in a procession this time.

1404
01:44:59,416 --> 01:45:01,583
If you pull these tricks again…

1405
01:45:02,916 --> 01:45:04,708
My goodness gracious!

1406
01:45:07,583 --> 01:45:08,791
I almost forgot...

1407
01:45:09,458 --> 01:45:11,541
Happy Sankranthi to you all.

1408
01:45:15,750 --> 01:45:17,000
What’s this?
-Hey, shut up!

1409
01:45:50,125 --> 01:45:52,833
“The girl in one chair…”

1410
01:45:53,500 --> 01:45:56,583
“The boy in another…”

1411
01:45:57,208 --> 01:45:59,583
“The girl in one chair…”

1412
01:46:00,750 --> 01:46:03,125
“The boy in another…”

1413
01:46:04,333 --> 01:46:07,833
“Supporting their love
have come forward”

1414
01:46:08,125 --> 01:46:09,625
“Friends and relatives,
siblings and cousins"

1415
01:46:09,916 --> 01:46:11,583
Babies and toddlers,
and youthful gangs”

1416
01:46:11,833 --> 01:46:16,208
“Young and old, men and women
all come together to celebrate…”

1417
01:46:17,125 --> 01:46:19,583
“Great, gala party”

1418
01:46:20,083 --> 01:46:22,625
“Great, great, gala party”

1419
01:46:24,458 --> 01:46:26,625
“A noisy, gala party”

1420
01:46:26,958 --> 01:46:29,958
“Hey, it’s a grand gala party”

1421
01:47:00,666 --> 01:47:03,458
“Some whistle so loud,
some make a big noise”

1422
01:47:04,083 --> 01:47:07,083
“They scream aloud
Some shout out”

1423
01:47:07,625 --> 01:47:11,291
“More than screams, shouts,
the mischief and all the hubbub”

1424
01:47:12,833 --> 01:47:19,208
“Sound high in the couple’s heart
the drums of love and beats of amor”

1425
01:47:19,708 --> 01:47:26,458
“Sound high in the couple’s heart
the drums of love and beats of amor”

1426
01:47:26,708 --> 01:47:27,458
“Hear it…”

1427
01:47:28,666 --> 01:47:29,500
“When you hear the rhythm…”

1428
01:47:30,208 --> 01:47:31,250
“When you hear the rhythm…”

1429
01:47:32,125 --> 01:47:33,750
“Great, gala party”

1430
01:47:34,791 --> 01:47:37,458
“Great, great, gala party”

1431
01:47:39,375 --> 01:47:40,958
“A noisy, gala party”

1432
01:47:41,708 --> 01:47:44,750
“Hey, it’s a grand gala party”

1433
01:48:08,250 --> 01:48:10,166
“Great, gala party”

1434
01:48:11,833 --> 01:48:13,541
“Great, great, gala party”

1435
01:48:14,541 --> 01:48:16,833
“A noisy, gala party”

1436
01:48:57,750 --> 01:48:58,625
Varalu!

1437
01:49:13,333 --> 01:49:17,166
When beautiful girls like you
roam alone at night this way,

1438
01:49:17,541 --> 01:49:19,916
boys like me turn into criminals.

1439
01:49:53,833 --> 01:49:55,833
Sound horn if you have
the guts now.

1440
01:49:56,375 --> 01:49:57,458
You rogue!

1441
01:49:58,708 --> 01:50:01,041
What do you think of Varalu?
Huh?

1442
01:50:03,416 --> 01:50:04,291
Come, idiot!

1443
01:50:04,625 --> 01:50:08,833
Let me first deal with Kishtaiah
and then I will take care of you.

1444
01:50:09,791 --> 01:50:11,541
Be patient till then.

1445
01:50:11,791 --> 01:50:12,583
Come on!

1446
01:51:01,458 --> 01:51:02,250
Huh?

1447
01:51:02,458 --> 01:51:04,625
Hey Bhaski, this shirt would
Look better on me.

1448
01:51:04,875 --> 01:51:05,833
This is my wedding.

1449
01:51:06,458 --> 01:51:07,333
Yeah, right.

1450
01:51:09,500 --> 01:51:11,000
It looks very plain on you.

1451
01:51:11,458 --> 01:51:12,958
And you are also quite
plain looking.

1452
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:18,083
Dad, dad! I want a white frock.

1453
01:51:18,750 --> 01:51:20,333
Excuse me!
Please, take out that white frock.

1454
01:51:20,416 --> 01:51:21,875
This one, sir?
-No, not that. The next!

1455
01:51:21,958 --> 01:51:22,833
This one?
-Yes!

1456
01:51:24,791 --> 01:51:26,625
Fold it and put it in cover.
You pay up.

1457
01:51:30,833 --> 01:51:32,708
Watch it today itself.
Watch it today.

1458
01:51:32,916 --> 01:51:34,833
Chiranjeevi’s ‘Manchi Donga’!
New film.

1459
01:51:35,333 --> 01:51:36,125
Hey Bhaski!

1460
01:51:36,208 --> 01:51:38,000
Wait, wait.
We got to shop for Kumari.

1461
01:51:38,208 --> 01:51:39,708
We can shop tomorrow.
Come fast.

1462
01:51:40,750 --> 01:51:41,541
Here, sir!

1463
01:51:57,416 --> 01:51:58,458
Come on uncle, louder!

1464
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:00,875
Anji!

1465
01:52:03,458 --> 01:52:04,416
Anji!

1466
01:52:13,208 --> 01:52:15,000
Sister, can you get me two tickets?

1467
01:52:15,458 --> 01:52:17,125
Make your wife stand in queue
and get them.

1468
01:52:17,208 --> 01:52:18,833
My wife is five months
pregnant, sister.

1469
01:52:19,083 --> 01:52:20,750
The doctor advised her not to
stand in queue for long.

1470
01:52:20,791 --> 01:52:22,000
Idiot! That’s my sister.

1471
01:52:22,125 --> 01:52:23,375
Oh, your sister!

1472
01:52:24,833 --> 01:52:27,291
Sister, I will buy you a soda.
Can you get me two tickets?

1473
01:52:27,458 --> 01:52:28,333
Okay, brother.

1474
01:52:33,791 --> 01:52:35,083
Here are your tickets, brother.

1475
01:52:35,958 --> 01:52:36,666
Bhaski!

1476
01:52:38,583 --> 01:52:39,500
Great trick!

1477
01:52:45,291 --> 01:52:46,750
Uh, here.
These are our seats.

1478
01:52:52,750 --> 01:52:54,375
Whoever placed a seat
in front of legs is a donkey.

1479
01:52:56,750 --> 01:52:57,708
Look straight.

1480
01:53:00,250 --> 01:53:01,041
Oh, crap!

1481
01:53:01,166 --> 01:53:03,250
If we watch Chiranjeevi’s film
without bidi, I will be blamed.

1482
01:53:42,291 --> 01:53:43,791
Rogues! Who are you all?

1483
01:53:44,083 --> 01:53:45,291
Show yourselves if you have
the guts.

1484
01:53:50,166 --> 01:53:51,041
Hey!

1485
01:54:02,583 --> 01:54:03,625
Bhaski! Go away!

1486
01:54:04,666 --> 01:54:05,708
I said go away!

1487
01:54:22,291 --> 01:54:23,250
Inform Kishtaiah.

1488
01:54:41,458 --> 01:54:42,291
Hey!

1489
01:54:42,416 --> 01:54:44,208
Hey, stop!
Stop!

1490
01:54:46,541 --> 01:54:47,416
Come on!

1491
01:54:48,625 --> 01:54:49,583
Hey!

1492
01:56:16,333 --> 01:56:17,041
Wow!

1493
01:56:21,250 --> 01:56:22,375
What did he say?

1494
01:56:22,708 --> 01:56:23,541
Huh?

1495
01:56:24,291 --> 01:56:27,541
It’s not possible to kill Anji
while Kishtaiah is alive?

1496
01:56:30,708 --> 01:56:32,583
But we are hacking Anji here...

1497
01:56:33,458 --> 01:56:35,041
and why doesn’t Kishtaiah come?

1498
01:56:35,750 --> 01:56:36,708
Kishtaiah!

1499
01:56:36,916 --> 01:56:38,083
O, Kishtaiah!

1500
01:56:46,458 --> 01:56:47,916
What does that laugh mean?

1501
01:56:48,208 --> 01:56:48,916
Huh?

1502
01:57:00,416 --> 01:57:01,833
Hey Anji, come!

1503
01:57:07,958 --> 01:57:08,750
Hey, Dasu!

1504
01:57:09,250 --> 01:57:10,041
Dasu!

1505
01:57:22,750 --> 01:57:25,250
You saved my life
and I can’t kill you with my hands.

1506
01:57:26,666 --> 01:57:27,625
You are saved. Go!

1507
01:57:28,833 --> 01:57:29,583
Go on.

1508
01:57:37,500 --> 01:57:38,250
Hey!

1509
01:57:39,625 --> 01:57:42,291
Did you have a hope for life
for a moment?

1510
01:57:45,375 --> 01:57:52,208
When you kill someone who was
hoping to live… the high it gives…

1511
01:58:04,833 --> 01:58:05,625
Huh?

1512
01:58:06,208 --> 01:58:07,041
Manga!

1513
01:58:08,041 --> 01:58:09,500
Hey! No, no!

1514
01:58:09,708 --> 01:58:11,666
It's wrong.
She is your wife!

1515
01:58:12,833 --> 01:58:13,666
Hmm…!

1516
01:58:14,125 --> 01:58:14,916
Okay.

1517
01:58:15,375 --> 01:58:17,333
So, you want me to look after
Manga too!

1518
01:58:19,583 --> 01:58:20,541
Manga!

1519
01:58:21,666 --> 01:58:23,291
O, Manga!
-Dasu!

1520
01:58:24,208 --> 01:58:25,375
Dasu! Hey!

1521
01:58:26,666 --> 01:58:28,291
Dasu! Hey!

1522
01:58:28,541 --> 01:58:30,291
O, Manga!
-Dasu! Hey!

1523
01:58:59,291 --> 01:59:00,208
Anji…

1524
01:59:04,916 --> 01:59:06,958
Hey, hey! Anji!

1525
01:59:07,041 --> 01:59:09,083
Kishtaiah!
-Anji, Anji! I’m here.

1526
01:59:10,250 --> 01:59:11,375
Anji!
-Brother Anji!

1527
01:59:14,208 --> 01:59:15,666
Anji, talk to me.

1528
01:59:17,375 --> 01:59:18,250
Anji!

1529
01:59:18,458 --> 01:59:20,125
Hey, start the vehicle.

1530
01:59:20,458 --> 01:59:21,208
Anji!

1531
01:59:22,375 --> 01:59:24,000
Hey, get the vehicle.

1532
01:59:25,583 --> 01:59:26,958
Anji! Anji!

1533
01:59:31,291 --> 01:59:32,958
Hey, careful!

1534
01:59:33,416 --> 01:59:34,208
Careful!

1535
01:59:38,458 --> 01:59:41,916
“Two bosom friends greeting
with intimacy”

1536
01:59:42,250 --> 01:59:43,583
Brother, go fast.

1537
01:59:45,666 --> 01:59:47,500
“Pulling each other’s leg and
having fun”

1538
01:59:47,583 --> 01:59:48,333
Brother,

1539
01:59:49,291 --> 01:59:52,250
Chitti insisted on
a frock all of a sudden.

1540
01:59:53,375 --> 01:59:55,833
Probabaly, she knew I’d be gone.

1541
01:59:59,875 --> 02:00:03,125
Varalu has no one except
you, Kishtaiah.

1542
02:00:03,958 --> 02:00:08,750
Varalu has restrained herself because
her dad told her something while dying.

1543
02:00:09,416 --> 02:00:14,166
Now I want her to marry you
and tell her this is my dying wish.

1544
02:00:14,916 --> 02:00:16,125
That might melt her heart.

1545
02:00:16,250 --> 02:00:19,333
"Time has brought them together
with love"

1546
02:00:47,791 --> 02:00:48,541
Brother!

1547
02:00:53,291 --> 02:00:54,166
Brother!

1548
02:00:55,625 --> 02:00:56,541
Brother!

1549
02:00:59,541 --> 02:01:00,416
Brother!

1550
02:01:18,875 --> 02:01:19,708
What?

1551
02:01:19,958 --> 02:01:21,041
Has he sent this through you?

1552
02:01:28,916 --> 02:01:30,166
Wow, a frock!

1553
02:01:30,250 --> 02:01:31,541
Hey! Wear this
before your dad comes.

1554
02:01:31,666 --> 02:01:32,666
Okay!

1555
02:01:35,875 --> 02:01:37,041
What is this, brother?

1556
02:01:37,250 --> 02:01:39,333
He wants to roam around
even on the festival day.

1557
02:01:41,916 --> 02:01:44,041
Dad... here I come!

1558
02:01:45,541 --> 02:01:47,416
Hey, Bairi! Suri!

1559
02:01:47,500 --> 02:01:49,250
Hey! They have killed Anji, man!

1560
02:01:49,875 --> 02:01:51,166
Hey, they have killed Anji!

1561
02:01:51,666 --> 02:01:54,291
Hey! See what they have done
to Anji!

1562
02:01:54,666 --> 02:01:55,875
Oh, no!

1563
02:01:59,583 --> 02:02:01,500
Husband, husband!
-They have killed him, man!

1564
02:02:01,625 --> 02:02:02,958
Please, get up!
-They have killed him!

1565
02:02:03,125 --> 02:02:04,208
Oh, no! Oh, no!

1566
02:02:06,625 --> 02:02:09,000
What happened?
Oh, no! Oh, no.

1567
02:02:11,791 --> 02:02:12,708
Oh, no!

1568
02:02:12,958 --> 02:02:14,583
What happened? Speak!

1569
02:02:21,791 --> 02:02:23,166
What happened, brother?

1570
02:02:25,083 --> 02:02:26,083
Tell me, brother.

1571
02:02:26,833 --> 02:02:27,833
What happened?

1572
02:02:31,333 --> 02:02:33,375
How could he die
when you are with him, brother?

1573
02:02:41,458 --> 02:02:46,166
From tomorrow, only one of us
will call you brother.

1574
02:02:56,833 --> 02:02:58,666
Get up. Get up, husband.

1575
02:03:07,833 --> 02:03:11,708
Uncle, what happened to dad?

1576
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:13,916
Dad!

1577
02:03:14,208 --> 02:03:15,958
Chitti is calling you.
Please, get up.

1578
02:03:22,708 --> 02:03:23,958
Dad!
-Please, get up.

1579
02:03:34,500 --> 02:03:36,750
Dad… what happened to you dad?

1580
02:03:59,875 --> 02:04:00,708
Hey!

1581
02:04:02,208 --> 02:04:03,250
Our Anji…

1582
02:04:06,750 --> 02:04:07,833
It’s our Anji!

1583
02:04:40,916 --> 02:04:42,291
This shirt would look better
on you, brother.

1584
02:04:43,708 --> 02:04:44,541
Take it.

1585
02:04:45,333 --> 02:04:46,625
Please, get up once, brother.

1586
02:04:47,708 --> 02:04:48,666
Brother Anji!

1587
02:04:49,416 --> 02:04:50,791
Pease, get up once.

1588
02:05:27,250 --> 02:05:29,083
Anji died because of me, dad.

1589
02:05:34,166 --> 02:05:35,250
Even before he died…

1590
02:05:36,833 --> 02:05:40,958
...more than about his wife and kids,
he spoke about me.

1591
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:51,583
How do we deserve such people?

1592
02:05:51,750 --> 02:05:53,750
“God Himself…”

1593
02:05:54,750 --> 02:05:57,416
“In his own hand…”

1594
02:05:58,833 --> 02:06:03,291
Kishtaiah is all alone, dad.
-"Writes a beautiful poem"

1595
02:06:04,083 --> 02:06:06,375
Who else does he have, dad,
other than me?

1596
02:06:11,583 --> 02:06:12,750
I am going, dad.

1597
02:06:15,208 --> 02:06:16,166
Please, forgive me.

1598
02:06:51,333 --> 02:06:54,041
Not one man who had a hand
in Anji’s death should live.

1599
02:06:58,166 --> 02:07:00,541
But you... don’t die.

1600
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,333
Tut! Why should we run away
fearing him?

1601
02:07:33,416 --> 02:07:34,166
Hey!

1602
02:07:34,458 --> 02:07:38,500
Everyone knows about Rama’s wrath
against Ravana who had abducted Sita!

1603
02:07:38,916 --> 02:07:44,750
But had Ravana killed Hanuman for Sita,
I can visualise this Rama’s wrath.

1604
02:07:45,541 --> 02:07:46,541
Just once...

1605
02:07:47,666 --> 02:07:52,208
For saving his honour just once,
he watched this house for years.

1606
02:07:53,208 --> 02:07:57,333
Before his loyalty turns into vengeance
and swallows you, run for your life!

1607
02:07:57,583 --> 02:07:58,375
But dad…

1608
02:07:58,416 --> 02:07:59,750
Hey, who do you think he is?

1609
02:08:00,625 --> 02:08:01,750
He is Kishtaiah!

1610
02:08:06,708 --> 02:08:07,708
He will kill you!

1611
02:08:14,958 --> 02:08:16,083
Run away…

1612
02:08:23,791 --> 02:08:25,083
Run away!

1613
02:08:29,708 --> 02:08:32,750
Kishtaiah, they're not allowing
our chariots through their village.

1614
02:09:08,291 --> 02:09:10,000
I believe someone has killed Anji?

1615
02:09:10,875 --> 02:09:12,875
I wonder why no one has come
to file a case.

1616
02:09:13,041 --> 02:09:16,125
How could they when the killer
is not alive?

1617
02:09:17,375 --> 02:09:19,000
You mean Das?
Why would he...

1618
02:09:20,666 --> 02:09:22,416
So, Kishtaiah is going to kill
Das too?

1619
02:09:29,875 --> 02:09:33,208
But there should be no case
against Kishtaiah.

1620
02:09:34,250 --> 02:09:37,833
He is committing a murder. And if
you don't want me to file a case...

1621
02:09:55,791 --> 02:09:56,875
Hey, girl… girl!

1622
02:09:59,041 --> 02:10:01,041
So much money is not necessary
for a single murder.

1623
02:10:01,375 --> 02:10:02,583
Did I say one?

1624
02:10:18,500 --> 02:10:21,541
You told me not to involve our villages
over something we can resolve between us.

1625
02:10:22,041 --> 02:10:24,333
Why did you come with
the villagers then?

1626
02:10:33,291 --> 02:10:36,291
Every Kanuma festival…
we sacrifice goats.

1627
02:10:37,750 --> 02:10:41,208
But this time…
we'll sacrifice you.

1628
02:10:44,458 --> 02:10:45,375
Attack!

1629
02:11:26,916 --> 02:11:31,666
After the procession this evening,
go, count the severed heads.

1630
02:11:53,666 --> 02:11:55,125
"Goodness gracious"

1631
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:58,500
"My goodness gracious"

1632
02:12:15,166 --> 02:12:16,500
Kishtaiah!

1633
02:12:17,791 --> 02:12:18,750
Bhaskar!

1634
02:12:20,333 --> 02:12:21,208
Hey!

1635
02:12:30,458 --> 02:12:32,125
Hey, stop!
-Leave me, dad.

1636
02:12:33,583 --> 02:12:34,500
Leave me.

1637
02:12:39,916 --> 02:12:41,041
Kishtaiah!

1638
02:12:42,833 --> 02:12:44,333
O, Kishtaiah!

1639
02:14:26,625 --> 02:14:27,333
Hey!

1640
02:14:56,375 --> 02:14:57,333
Kishtaiah!

1641
02:15:40,583 --> 02:15:43,000
He said Anji could not be killed
as long as Kishtaiah was alive.

1642
02:15:43,250 --> 02:15:44,166
But I could kill him.

1643
02:15:46,166 --> 02:15:48,208
Now, I have killed Kishtaiah too.

1644
02:16:00,708 --> 02:16:03,416
None of Anji’s killers
should be alive.

1645
02:16:06,083 --> 02:16:08,291
But you... don't die.

1646
02:16:11,291 --> 02:16:14,958
“Abode of the destroyer”

1647
02:16:16,333 --> 02:16:19,083
“Abode of the destroyer”

1648
02:16:21,125 --> 02:16:24,458
“Abode of the destroyer”

1649
02:16:25,666 --> 02:16:29,541
"Abode of the destroyer"

1650
02:16:30,583 --> 02:16:34,041
“Abode of the destroyer”

1651
02:16:35,708 --> 02:16:39,250
“Abode of the destroyer”

1652
02:16:40,291 --> 02:16:44,333
“Abode of the destroyer”

1653
02:16:49,041 --> 02:16:53,458
"Lord Shiva comes for protection"

1654
02:16:56,250 --> 02:16:59,416
"This is his ferocious war"

1655
02:17:03,666 --> 02:17:07,791
"This is his protection from evil"

1656
02:17:10,916 --> 02:17:14,666
"Annihilating the monsters"

1657
02:17:19,666 --> 02:17:21,375
You keep chanting 'My Kishtaiah'.

1658
02:17:21,708 --> 02:17:23,041
But he is killing your sons there.

1659
02:17:25,833 --> 02:17:27,833
Master, you raised a snake
offering it milk.

1660
02:17:28,041 --> 02:17:29,000
He's killing everyone.

1661
02:17:33,166 --> 02:17:36,250
"He is in ferocious form"

1662
02:17:37,791 --> 02:17:41,250
"Against all the evil"

1663
02:17:42,791 --> 02:17:46,166
"This is the end of all demons"

1664
02:17:47,583 --> 02:17:50,916
"Protection for the humankind"

1665
02:17:56,833 --> 02:17:59,708
Your life was saved by Anji.

1666
02:18:00,666 --> 02:18:01,958
How can I kill you?

1667
02:18:03,083 --> 02:18:04,500
Live. Get lost.

1668
02:18:42,208 --> 02:18:42,958
Hey!

1669
02:18:43,541 --> 02:18:46,250
Did you hope for life for
a moment?

1670
02:18:48,416 --> 02:18:52,083
When you kill someone with
a hope to live, the high you get…

1671
02:18:52,833 --> 02:18:53,708
Hey!

1672
02:18:54,375 --> 02:18:56,125
My goodness gracious!

1673
02:19:40,541 --> 02:19:41,375
Master!

1674
02:19:49,833 --> 02:19:52,250
My sons are dead.

1675
02:19:53,083 --> 02:19:55,000
He killed my younger brother,
master.

1676
02:20:07,833 --> 02:20:10,791
So, are my sons
and that dog equal to you?

1677
02:20:30,291 --> 02:20:32,416
Hey! Master has killed Kishtaiah.

1678
02:20:32,666 --> 02:20:34,333
Hey, hey!
-Kishtaiah!

1679
02:20:35,125 --> 02:20:36,875
Hey, hey! Stop!

1680
02:20:38,458 --> 02:20:40,250
One step towards master
and I will kill you.

1681
02:20:40,583 --> 02:20:41,916
Get lost from here.

1682
02:20:42,125 --> 02:20:42,916
Go away.

1683
02:20:59,541 --> 02:21:01,500
Master, no problem.

1684
02:21:01,958 --> 02:21:03,000
You please go in.

1685
02:21:03,291 --> 02:21:04,625
Get inside! Please.

1686
02:21:04,916 --> 02:21:05,916
Go, master!

1687
02:21:06,375 --> 02:21:07,208
I'll kill you.

1688
02:21:52,583 --> 02:21:53,291
Kishtaiah!

1689
02:21:55,250 --> 02:21:56,083
Kishtaiah!

1690
02:22:00,083 --> 02:22:00,916
Kishtaiah!

1691
02:22:07,833 --> 02:22:09,833
Hey, don't cry.
Nothing happened to me.

1692
02:22:12,250 --> 02:22:13,250
After ten years,

1693
02:22:14,791 --> 02:22:16,083
you have asked me for something.

1694
02:22:16,583 --> 02:22:17,750
Not to die.

1695
02:22:19,291 --> 02:22:21,625
I wouldn’t die even after
ten more stabs from them.

1696
02:22:28,416 --> 02:22:29,208
Varalu!

1697
02:22:30,958 --> 02:22:32,208
Marry me.

1698
02:23:06,666 --> 02:23:07,708
Hey, Anji!

1699
02:23:09,041 --> 02:23:10,208
Daddy!

1700
02:23:16,375 --> 02:23:20,500
“Meddle with us, try to mess with us…
You will be in for a shock”

1701
02:23:20,750 --> 02:23:23,375
“My goodness gracious
-My goodness gracious”

1702
02:23:25,875 --> 02:23:30,041
“Cross your line, get caught by us…
You will be in for a shock”

1703
02:23:30,666 --> 02:23:33,041
“My goodness gracious
-My goodness gracious”

1704
02:23:33,416 --> 02:23:38,125
“When we say one, we mean the village
When we say village, we mean each one”

1705
02:23:38,625 --> 02:23:40,958
“When we say one…
-we mean the village”

1706
02:23:41,458 --> 02:23:43,833
“When we say village…
-we mean each one”

1707
02:23:44,083 --> 02:23:49,208
“With us…with us…
pick a fight with us and”

1708
02:23:49,958 --> 02:23:52,541
“Goodness gracious
-My goodness gracious”

1709
02:23:52,708 --> 02:23:55,458
“Goodness gracious
-My goodness gracious”

1710
02:23:55,625 --> 02:23:58,291
“Goodness gracious
-My goodness gracious”

1711
02:23:58,500 --> 02:24:01,166
“Goodness gracious
-My goodness gracious”

1712
02:24:01,333 --> 02:24:04,208
“Goodness...
-gracious”

1713
02:24:04,458 --> 02:24:06,875
“Goodness gracious
-My goodness gracious”
