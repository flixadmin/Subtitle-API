1
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,590
What a mess!

2
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:13,560
Krishna...Krishna...Krishna...

3
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,560
What am l going to do with this boy...?

4
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,180
Krishna...

5
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:44,670
Yes, grandma?

6
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,850
Whose sketch book is this?

7
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,680
Mine, grandma.

8
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,000
And who made these sketches?

9
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:55,010
Grandma, why do grown ups sometimes
ask childish questions...?

10
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,180
lf it's my sketch book, obviously,
l've made the sketches.

11
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:03,840
Grown ups talk like children when
children act like grown ups.

12
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:08,360
Tell me something, how did you make
such beautiful sketches?

13
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:09,300
With this.

14
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:13,180
Like l've made your
sketch right now. See?

15
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,680
Wow!

16
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,190
Let me see!

17
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,690
Rohit loved drawing too.

18
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,580
Papa made sketches too?

19
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:26,760
Yes.

20
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:33,030
When Rohit was your age and
he used to get tired studying

21
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,530
he used to sketch.

22
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,200
l want to be like my Papa too.

23
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,350
You are like your Papa!

24
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,860
Mrs Mehra, l've called you here
to tell you that...

25
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,680
we want to take Krishna's l.Q. test.

26
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,040
l.Q. test...?

27
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,030
But why, Father?

28
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:57,380
Krishna's absolutely normal.

29
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,710
No, Mrs Mehra.

30
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,030
He's not normal.

31
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,210
What are you saying, Father?

32
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,200
Are you telling me...

33
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,520
that Krishna is the same as
Rohit was in his childhood?

34
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:11,360
No, Father.

35
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,710
Krishna's a very bright child.

36
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:18,950
He scores very good marks, he
always gets A-plus grades.

37
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:22,680
He even does his homework
without any help.

38
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,610
And that of other children too.

39
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,190
What?

40
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,730
This is the notebook of
a Class 3 student.

41
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:36,890
This is...

42
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,660
...Krishna's handwriting.

43
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:41,730
Yes, Krishna has done this
child's math homework.

44
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:51,490
But how's that possible, Father?
Krishna's still in Class 1.

45
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,320
That's exactly why we wish to
take Krishna's l.Q. test...

46
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:02,230
so that we can ascertain just how bright,
sharp and ahead he is...

47
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,430
of other children his age

48
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,680
Krishna, how do you define amount?

49
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,300
Principle plus interest is equal to amount, sir

50
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:18,580
After what age does the brain
of a person stop growing?

51
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:22,760
Afterthe age of 15, Father.

52
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,810
What happened, Mrs Mehra?

53
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:48,380
The l.Q. test was going so well, Krishna
was answering all questions right...

54
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,280
That's exactly why l brought him away.

55
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,590
But why?

56
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:58,320
You ought to be proud that
your grandson is so brilliant.

57
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:01,520
He's a genius, a miracle child.

58
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,060
Earlier it was a hunch
but now l'm sure.

59
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:11,690
The powers that Jadoo
had bestowed on Rohit...

60
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,400
...have been inherited by Krishna.

61
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:22,060
You will see, Mrs Mehra.
Like his father...

62
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:25,700
...Krishna will also achieve
great success.

63
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,970
His name will appear in
the Guinness Book ...

64
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:32,330
...and the whole world will
speak highly of him.

65
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,460
That's exactly what l don't want, Father.

66
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,530
What did Rohit gain, after all?

67
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,210
They gave him medals, applauded him...

68
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,360
but everybody only used him..

69
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,280
...took advantage of him, Father.

70
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,410
And then...

71
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:03,940
...l lost my son and my daughter-in-law.

72
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,780
l don't want to lose Krishna now.

73
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:11,780
l don't want to lose him.

74
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:16,150
l can understand your concern and fears.

75
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,170
But destiny cannot be changed.

76
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:26,660
And talent is a gift which cannot be hidden.

77
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,750
l will hide it.

78
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:35,230
l'll take Krishna far away...

79
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,190
... very far.

80
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:34,440
Krishna... Krishna...

81
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:39,630
Coming, Grandma!

82
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,280
Toofan, let's see who gets home first.

83
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,850
Hey... what did you see?

84
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:48,160
As usual, l've seen nothing and
l won't say a word to anyone.

85
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,360
But as usual, l'll take
something from you.

86
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:53,500
Take this!

87
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,630
l hide all your secrets and you
always give me jaggery?

88
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,170
lt won't work today.

89
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:04,470
Ok, ok, come home...
l'll give you Bournvita.

90
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:05,540
Bournvita?

91
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,540
Yes. Don't you want to be like me?

92
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:08,690
Yes!

93
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,530
So go, wear something below and come.

94
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,050
Krishna...

95
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,350
You've come?

96
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,040
Grandma, how do you know l've come?

97
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,680
l make no sound at all!

98
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,180
l can hearyour heartbeats.

99
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,860
But how, Grandma?

100
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:42,980
Your eyes say that you've been
upto mischief again.

101
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:47,670
Mischief? Not at all, Grandma!

102
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,820
No mischief? Then why're you hiding
yourface like a thief?

103
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,150
Not hiding, just washing my face, Grandma

104
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,650
Ok ok.. lay the breakfast.

105
00:11:58,850 --> 00:11:59,640
l've come!

106
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,710
What happened?

107
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:35,540
Chintu dropped a glass, Grandma...

108
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,380
Me?

109
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:40,710
Chintu! Upto mischief again?

110
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:44,040
Tell herthe truth, Krishna, else l shall.

111
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,540
Sure, go ahead

112
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,170
l'll tell her since you've asked me to

113
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:53,180
Grandma, Krishna was running faster
than Toofan today

114
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:55,990
What? Fasterthan Toofan?

115
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,280
So? What's the big deal?

116
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,480
And how about that?

117
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:01,310
What?

118
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,490
You climbed the mountain faster
than the monkeys...

119
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:09,070
Grandma, you know that tall
mountain by the temple?

120
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,410
Krishna jumped from it
into the river.

121
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:15,260
l thought it was all over.
But he came back!

122
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,660
Krishna, why do you do such things?

123
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:24,630
l've forbidden you time and again!
Why do you still do such things?

124
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,460
What do l do Grandma?
You tell me!

125
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,560
How do l rid myself of loneliness?

126
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:32,890
Who do l make friends with?

127
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,580
Boys my age have gone away to the city,
to either study or earn a living

128
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:40,900
And those that are here don't
want be friends with me

129
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,410
They say... l'm not like them

130
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,070
So l've made friends with
animals and birds

131
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:57,080
Keep myself busy with nature.

132
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,410
But even out here in the open,
l sometimes feel stifled

133
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,920
l feel like running far away
from here.

134
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,420
Will you leave me and go away?

135
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:21,010
lt's because of you that l don't go!
Else, l'd have left long ago

136
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:38,250
Krishna has grown up, Rohit

137
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:45,090
l'm not sure how long l will be
able to hide him

138
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:50,760
Where is Sonia Mehra and her
grandson Krishna, Father?

139
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:56,270
lt's the third time in so many years
that l've come to ask you

140
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,770
And my answer is still the same.

141
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:04,100
l have no idea where Mrs Mehra is.
l really don't know!

142
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:08,100
Why do you keep coming to me again
and again and waste my time?

143
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:12,230
Because you are the last link to
Rohit Mehra's family...

144
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:16,450
and you're the last person Sonia Mehra
met before she went missing

145
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,440
You know where they are,
but you're lying.

146
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,580
What?

147
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:25,850
You are lying, Father.

148
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:31,310
When l asked you whether Krishna possessed
the powers Rohit had...

149
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,720
you said he didn't.

150
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,220
But l was told...that the son was
betterthan his father

151
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:43,420
That he possesses all of Rohit's powers.
So tell me, Father...

152
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,230
l'll pay any price you ask

153
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:49,280
How dare you! Mr Sinha,
this is a school!

154
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,620
We don't indulge
in business here!

155
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,190
Please leave now!

156
00:15:56,090 --> 00:16:00,250
You're making a mistake, Father.
A big mistake.

157
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,770
Krishna! Look!

158
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,370
What a huge kite!

159
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,530
But where's the string?

160
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,530
Must've snapped. Let's get it!

161
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:29,150
Don't scream! You needn't be afraid

162
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:35,500
Close your eyes and hold on to me tightly

163
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,670
Stop screaming!

164
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:58,000
Else, l'll drop you.

165
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:00,500
Close your eyes

166
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,170
Close your eyes, not widen them.

167
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,010
Close them!

168
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,840
Close!

169
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,340
The glider came this way!

170
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,510
There it is!

171
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,180
Where...?

172
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,190
Up there!

173
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:38,520
Oh my God! Where's Priya?

174
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:39,690
There!

175
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,360
She's breathing. She must've passed out

176
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,830
Let's take her back to the camp

177
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,370
The glider was at such a height,
Priya Ma'am was down here...

178
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:09,690
...and she's still breathing?
Just imagine!

179
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:15,030
Just imagine.

180
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,210
lmagine!

181
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:41,210
Where am l...?

182
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,210
You're alive and you're with us

183
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,210
Thank God you're alive.

184
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:49,210
Not God, it's that boy
we ought to thank

185
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:52,560
That boy...? Which boy?

186
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:56,390
The one who saved my life

187
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:59,380
A boy saved you?

188
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,720
But there was no one there

189
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,720
No sir! He must've been there!
We fell from the tree together.

190
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:10,380
Together...? But you went
in the glider alone.

191
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:13,390
How did he come on
the tree to rescue you...?

192
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,390
Did he fall from the skies?

193
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,220
Yes sir. That's where he came from!

194
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,400
Priya, trust me, you were all alone. Right?

195
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,220
Ghost!

196
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,050
What happened?

197
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,060
G-H-O-S-T !

198
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,230
Komal sir, ghost!

199
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:35,900
Ghost?

200
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,310
What are you blabbering, Bahadur?

201
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:51,310
No blabber, sir. lt's a chant.
To drive the ghost away.

202
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:54,640
What rubbish, Bahadur?
Ghost in broad daylight?

203
00:21:54,870 --> 00:22:00,310
This is a jungle, sir! Night
and day are all the same here

204
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,490
Priya Ma'am, was he tall?

205
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:03,650
Yes

206
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:05,820
Well built?

207
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:06,990
Yes!

208
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:08,310
Fair-skinned?

209
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:09,140
Yes!

210
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,140
Kalicharan!

211
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,150
Kalicharan...?

212
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:13,320
Kalicharan...?

213
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:16,320
Yes, sir! Kalicharan's ghost!

214
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:20,150
Been wandering in the mountains
for ages... upside down on trees

215
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:21,650
Just imagine!

216
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:22,650
What nonsense!

217
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:26,500
A ghost in ourtimes...?
l don't believe all this.

218
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,160
l also don't believe all this!

219
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,160
What happened?

220
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:32,500
What happened?

221
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:33,990
Relax...

222
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,150
Sir, it's either a sprain or a fracture

223
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,660
Oh no!

224
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:44,990
We're here on a 10-day
adventure camp...

225
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,820
...and you've already broken yourfoot!

226
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:51,830
Honey, take her into the tent
and give herfirst-aid

227
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:52,840
Careful...

228
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:03,100
Bahadur, go to your phone booth
and call for a car

229
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,110
We need to send Priya to
the city fortreatment

230
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:09,330
l'll go at night, sir.
l feel scared by day.

231
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,330
What?

232
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:12,340
Yes! Kalicharan's ghost.

233
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:14,850
Scares people by day
and sleeps at night.

234
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,020
Just imagine!

235
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:17,650
Easy, easy

236
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:20,010
Just relax. l'll organise a painkiller

237
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,510
C'mon guys. Let's go

238
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:47,280
You're always screaming!
Doesn't yourthroat hurt?

239
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:50,120
Your eyes are widening again!

240
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:56,460
You must never get scared...

241
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:59,950
What happened, Priya?
Why were you screaming?

242
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:03,800
Honey, he was here! ln this room!
He was here, Honey!

243
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:06,310
Who...? Who was here?

244
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,800
The boy who saved me
on the tree...

245
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:10,630
the one l told you about, sir...

246
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,460
God! What's happened to this girl?

247
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:18,280
Priya, it's just 2 seconds since l left...

248
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,970
Are you saying that someone came
and even went away in the meantime...?

249
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:24,470
You must've dozed off and
probably had a dream.

250
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,130
l didn't dream! Why doesn't
someone believe me?

251
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,140
The moment l closed my eyes,
he entered the tent...

252
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:34,140
he twisted my ankle and the pain...

253
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,470
Hey! The pain in my ankle is gone! See!

254
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,310
The pain has disappeared!

255
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:44,810
Oh my God sir! My foot is all right!

256
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,970
Look at this... l can jump!

257
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:51,650
My foot has become all right

258
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,820
Eitherthis girl has really gone mad,
or she's conning us!

259
00:24:55,990 --> 00:25:01,150
No, sir! l'm not conning you! See...
l can jump! Believe me!

260
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:05,490
l believe you! Kalicharan has
cured yourfoot

261
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:06,460
Just imagine!

262
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,650
Kalicharan...? So this ghost
is also a doctor?

263
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:10,820
Not is, was!

264
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:14,330
Kalicharan's father, Lalcharan.
Doctor Lalcharan.

265
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:19,990
There's no Kalicharan, there's
no Lalcharan... it's a pack of lies!

266
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:22,830
lt's some stupid local boy
playing a prank on me

267
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,000
l'm going to find him today,
bring him before everybody...

268
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,310
and prove to them that he's
just another boy!

269
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,160
Are you looking for someone?

270
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,330
What...?

271
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:34,170
You! l'm looking foryou!

272
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:37,530
Where do you keep disappearing?

273
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,440
Why don't you appear before others
as you appear before me?

274
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:44,000
And that stupid Bahadur keeps telling
them that you're a ghost!

275
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:47,840
You... you're not Kalicharan, are you?

276
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,670
You're human, aren't you?

277
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,640
Why are you kids giggling ?

278
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:58,440
Who are you talking to, aunty?

279
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:02,810
Aunty...? Firstly you call me aunty and
then you ask who l am speaking to?

280
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,490
l'm talking to this boy!

281
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:05,990
Which Boy?

282
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:10,150
Can't you see this boy here...?

283
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:13,650
That's a lamppost there, not a Boy,

284
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,820
That's a boy

285
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:17,480
Lamppost

286
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,150
Boy!

287
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:18,820
Lamppost!

288
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:19,810
Shut up!

289
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,480
One moment. Please Listen...

290
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,990
What do you see there?
A boy? Or a lamppost?

291
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:35,160
Well... there's neither a boy
there nor a lamppost.

292
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:36,330
Look carefully...

293
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:44,490
What happened...?

294
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:48,650
l'm feeling giddy.

295
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:51,160
You seem unwell

296
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:55,670
My house is nearby...
come rest there for a while

297
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,330
l'll get you a glass of water

298
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,000
Okay!

299
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,830
Why's his picture garlanded?

300
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:16,670
My son. He died 20 years ago

301
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:22,680
But how's that possible...?
Moments ago, l...

302
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:48,880
lt's a tragic tale that took place
20 years ago

303
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:52,320
Champa and Kalicharan

304
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:57,750
Kalicharan and Champa.
Madly in love with each other

305
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:00,420
They were like one soul two bodies.

306
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,930
And then one day...

307
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,430
What happened?

308
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,760
Kalicharan was putting some flowers
in Champa's hair...

309
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,930
Lalcharan happened to see them.

310
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:13,100
He went red with rage!

311
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:21,430
And one day, he deceived Champa into
drinking poison, in the name of medicine

312
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:27,440
And poor Champa! She screamed,
''Kali, Kali...''

313
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:31,780
... and died. Just imagine!

314
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:37,430
Kalicharan just could not bear
the pain of Champa's death

315
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:41,270
Overthere! Look at that peak!

316
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:48,940
From that very peak, Kalicharan
screamed, ''Champa, Champa...''

317
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,780
... and jumped to his death!

318
00:28:53,120 --> 00:29:00,140
Ever since, Kalicharan's spirit has
been looking for his Champa!

319
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:03,950
Why're you pointing towards me?

320
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:06,610
Because you are his Champa

321
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,120
Me...? Champa!

322
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:11,280
l mean, you look like Champa

323
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:16,300
l'm feeling terribly scared. We can't
stay here anymore, please

324
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,790
Nobody goes anywhere!

325
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:23,960
This silly Bahadurtalks a lot of nonsense...

326
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,790
...and you start imagining?

327
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:31,620
Bahadur, you're not telling these kids
anymore stories. Understand?

328
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:36,790
And now get ready. We're going
mountain-climbing

329
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:47,470
You will use ascenders to climb...

330
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,470
...descenders to come down.

331
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,800
And you will come rappelling, down.

332
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,300
'right sir.ok sir'

333
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:10,140
Ghost!

334
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:13,150
Priya!

335
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:35,320
What... what on earth is that?

336
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,820
Kalicharan!

337
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:40,820
Just imagine

338
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:43,160
Can't imagine

339
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,330
Temperature. 104 degrees

340
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,660
We had told you sir.

341
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:54,330
But you didn't listen.

342
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:56,180
Sorry, sorry

343
00:30:57,870 --> 00:30:59,870
We're not staying here any more

344
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:03,330
Bahadur, leave immediately.

345
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:08,000
And arrange for
ourtransportation. Go!

346
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:11,500
You've snatched my bread and butter.

347
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,010
l'm broke even before l could
make some money.

348
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,190
Just imagine!

349
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:20,370
Why did you climb the mountain
like that, in front of them?

350
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,180
What could l do? She screamed
so loudly...

351
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:28,350
..that l got scared

352
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:33,670
And now they are so scared,
that they're all going back.

353
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:38,100
Now keep searching foryour
Champa all your life!

354
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:42,090
What do we do, Bahadur?

355
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:46,190
How do l know? l did as you said

356
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,030
You think of a way now

357
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,360
ldea!

358
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,030
What?

359
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:54,020
Champa-ji...

360
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,850
My name is Priya.

361
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:01,870
ln this lifetime

362
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:06,350
ln your earlier six births you were
Kalicharan's Champa

363
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:08,040
This is your 7th birth.

364
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,860
lf you leave without meeting him,
he'll be very angry...

365
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:15,200
And he'll follow you
whereveryou go

366
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:16,520
Just imagine!

367
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:21,020
How will he follow her?
We're going back to Singapore

368
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:25,720
He can reach Singapore too!
He doesn't need airtickets

369
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:29,710
Bahadur, she's not meeting any ghost!
What if something happens to her?

370
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:35,040
This ghost is a gentleman, ma'am.
He hasn't harmed a soul

371
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:35,870
Am l right?

372
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:37,570
Yes

373
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:40,540
l leave the rest to you

374
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:43,540
Wait Bahadur!

375
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:47,530
Honey...

376
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,550
Yes?

377
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,050
l think he's right

378
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,050
You're going to meet him?

379
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:56,680
Yes. Only then will he find peace

380
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:59,040
And you better not stop her

381
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:04,190
if Kalicharan gets to know...
just imagine!

382
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:06,210
No! l wasn't stopping her!

383
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:09,540
l was only advising you, right...?

384
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:14,890
Listen, you must meet the ghost.
He's such a gentleman!

385
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:16,560
l'm off to sleep.
Bye, good night!

386
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:27,570
Champa... Champa...

387
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:59,230
Hello! Kalicharan ji...

388
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:00,920
Here l am...

389
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:04,080
... to help you get peace

390
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,750
Please... could you appear
before me?

391
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,760
''l feel scared''

392
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:17,920
Do ghosts also feel
scared nowadays?

393
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,400
''l'm not a ghost''

394
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:28,590
You aren't a ghost?

395
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:31,930
Oh yes, l get it...

396
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:36,250
it offends you when someone calls
you a ghost, isn't it?

397
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:41,920
And you're right! You've ended
your life for love

398
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:46,750
And those who end their lives
for love aren't ghosts...

399
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:49,930
They are... they are...

400
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:54,100
They're lovers! You're
a lover, aren't you?

401
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:55,940
l'm Krishna

402
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:10,100
Look... stay right there!

403
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:12,100
Don't come closer, okay?

404
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,110
You sent for me
and here l am.

405
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:17,440
You'll get peace now

406
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:18,950
May l go now?

407
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,940
All l want is friendship

408
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:24,110
Friendship...?

409
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,440
Hey... don't be afraid.
l'm as human as you are

410
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,740
Touch me if you can't
believe that.

411
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,440
Touch you?

412
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:39,790
l'm sorry

413
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:44,790
See? The colour of my blood
is red, too.

414
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,780
Are you convinced now
that l'm not a ghost?

415
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:51,620
lf you're not a ghost then
that picture?

416
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:56,950
That's my father's photograph.
He's no more

417
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:58,620
l look exactly like him.

418
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:00,280
l see

419
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:05,950
But the other day, how did you suddenly
get on that tree to save my life?

420
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:09,960
And yesterday! How did you climb
that mountain so fast?

421
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:14,140
Maybe because l've got used to it

422
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:20,700
Right from my childhood, l've grown up
playing among the trees and mountains...

423
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:23,300
...with the birds and the animals.
l spend most of my time here

424
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,710
l guess that's why they're my friends

425
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:28,310
Would you like to
meet my friends?

426
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:50,890
Wow! l still can't believe it!

427
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:56,110
l won't let you poke that pin again!
lt hurts because l'm not Kalicharan.

428
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:05,650
See? He's not Kalicharan!
l've always been saying that!

429
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:07,660
That's what you're still saying.

430
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:13,900
l'm Right!

431
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:20,560
Kalicharan! You're so cute!

432
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:25,650
Krishna, you really got us scared.
But that was a nice prank.

433
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:29,990
Boys and girls,
camping continues!

434
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:33,000
Krishna, you also join the group!

435
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:06,680
Just imagine!

436
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,680
C'mon! C'mon!

437
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:15,390
Come

438
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:54,890
From where are you getting a flower of
a new colour every time, Krishna?

439
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,210
From the rainbow.

440
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,890
The rainbow?

441
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,230
Yes

442
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,560
Look

443
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:19,560
Wow Krishna! lt's such
a beautiful sight

444
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:25,240
Had l not come here, l'd really
have regretted it

445
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:27,910
So would l

446
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:34,740
l've never seen such a lovely place.

447
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:42,740
lt's so beautiful. So pure,
so serene, so quiet

448
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:45,410
You should see this place in autumn.

449
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:47,920
lt's a riot of colours

450
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:52,760
When the sunrays touch the
fallen leaves, everything turns to gold

451
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:54,420
lt's so beautiful

452
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:58,110
Makes you realise what
a great artist God really is

453
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:02,320
Krishna, you speak English?

454
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,420
And with such fluency?

455
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:10,750
Grandma taught me. She's my
school, my college and my university

456
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:15,250
But you need talent to
learn anything, Krishna

457
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:17,100
And you possess amazing talent.

458
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:18,590
You're amazing!

459
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:22,930
You shouldn't be wasting your
talent in this remote village

460
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:24,930
You ought to get out of here.

461
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,930
People in the world out there...

462
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:30,760
...not just need talented people
like you, they appreciate them too

463
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:35,420
But my grandma is my world

464
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:39,440
l will never leave her.

465
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:43,100
You love your grandma
very much?

466
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:45,500
More than very much

467
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:48,040
Krishna, l want to meet
your grandma

Grandma... this is Priya.

493
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:31,390
Hello, Grandma

494
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:32,890
We've met before.

495
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:35,380
l remember. Tell me something...

496
00:46:35,870 --> 00:46:38,360
Why did you go away, the other day?

497
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:40,560
l fled, grandma! Out of fright

498
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:43,960
Krishna was playing a ghost
to scare us

499
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:45,120
Ghost...?

500
00:46:50,930 --> 00:46:55,300
And that well-built Komal Sir
was trembling in his boots!

501
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:58,260
He was down with 104 degrees fever!

502
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:00,070
What? 104 degrees?

503
00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:01,900
ls that true, Krishna?

504
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,090
You shouldn't play such pranks
on anyone, my son

505
00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:06,930
Why scare someone so much?

506
00:47:07,170 --> 00:47:10,900
Did you apologise?

507
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:13,410
Yes, Grandma. To everybody

508
00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:26,520
Priya ... tell me something about yourself

509
00:47:27,310 --> 00:47:29,970
l live in Singapore with my Mother.

510
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:32,450
My father is no more

511
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:35,300
l'm here in lndia on a vacation
with my friend...

512
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,020

Priya, for how many more days
are you here?

516
00:48:15,770 --> 00:48:18,320
Days...? we're leaving today.

517
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:19,770
ln fact, right now

518
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:22,630
Oh my God! l must leave now.

519
00:48:22,810 --> 00:48:24,610
Everyone must be waiting for me.

520

Here's my phone number.

to serve you again

523
00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:33,940
Where's Priya?

524
00:48:34,110 --> 00:48:34,970
There she is!

525
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:36,440
Hurry, we've got to leave.

526
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,000
C'mon, everybody! Get in!

527
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:40,210
Nice meeting you.

528
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:43,010
we really enjoyed your
company, Krishna.

529
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:44,440
We'd love to come back.

530
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:46,250
lt was great fun, Krishna.

531
00:48:51,450 --> 00:48:52,550
Thanks, Krishna!

532
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:54,940
l had a wonderful time with you.

533
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:58,880
l didn't even realize how ten days
have passed by

534
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:00,080
Really!

535
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:02,550
l'm going to miss this place...

536
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:05,340
And you, too.

537
00:49:06,990 --> 00:49:08,680
Look afteryourself, Kalicharan.

538
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:11,800
l have to go now.

539
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:15,090
May l?

540
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:19,800
May l go?

541
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:26,990
Krishna, how will she go,
if you don't leave her hand?

542
00:49:31,590 --> 00:49:32,690
Bye, Krishna

543
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:34,660
Bye

544
00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:56,540
Priya... See!

545
00:50:30,790 --> 00:50:33,590
Looks like you're no longer Priya.
You've become Radha.

546
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:36,130
Krishna's Radha.

547
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:38,820
What?

548
00:50:39,590 --> 00:50:44,260
l seriously think Krishna has
fallen in love with you.

549
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,230
l hope not...

550
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:24,800
Honey, pray that the boss' mood is ok,
we're five days late.

551
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:34,340
Hi! Honey. Hi! Priya

552
00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:38,240
We are saying hi to them,

553
00:51:38,430 --> 00:51:39,890
Why're they waving five fingers at us?

554
00:51:40,050 --> 00:51:42,680
Stupid! The five fingers
stand forfive days.

555
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:44,850
Oh my God! You mean boss too...

556
00:51:49,850 --> 00:51:51,650
You took a leave of 15 days...

557
00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:53,620
...and have come after 20!

558
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:57,190
So you girls are now fired!

559
00:51:58,170 --> 00:52:01,900
Why just lndia?
Go on a world tour! Go!

560
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:06,500
Stop, Priya.

561
00:52:07,870 --> 00:52:10,920
Sorry boss, but you can't insult us.

562
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:12,830
Yeah?

563
00:52:13,030 --> 00:52:13,900
Yeah!

564
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:19,530
Boss, you can't question
our integrity.

565
00:52:19,690 --> 00:52:21,670
Agreed we were on a leave
of 15 days

566
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:25,980
But on the 16th day we got to work

567
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:28,940
What amazing work have you done?

568
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:32,040
We have found an lndian superboy.

569
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:33,870
Honey! What are you saying?

570
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,640
Let me speak, please.

571
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:41,430
Boss, this boy scales high mountains
as if they were mere steps for him!

572
00:52:41,710 --> 00:52:43,470
He runs fasterthan a horse!

573
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:44,640
And guess what?

574
00:52:44,890 --> 00:52:47,370
He puts his hand in the river
and pulls out fish!

575
00:52:50,110 --> 00:52:55,710
Just think of it, if a boy as talented
as him were to come here...

576
00:52:56,390 --> 00:53:00,380
...your rating's are going to soar!
Just imagine!

577
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:07,060
l hope you're not trying to make
a fool out of me?

578
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:12,220
No way, boss!
You will believe it too...

579
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:16,870
...when you see him doing all those
incredible things here!

580
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:20,900
See him here! How? How's he going
to come here?

581
00:53:21,790 --> 00:53:24,880
l tried to stop you, but you just
wouldn't listen!

582
00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:30,960
Please, Priya! There was no other way
of saving our job.

583
00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:34,590
Besides, what's wrong if Krishna
comes here?

584
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:36,580
There you go again!

585
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:38,570
Relax! Sit down

586
00:53:38,830 --> 00:53:43,310
lf Krishna's talents are
showcased on our channel...

587
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:46,670
...he'd be the one who'd gain.
Name, fame, money...

588
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:50,470
He'll have everything!
He'll be a big man!

589
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:51,800
Just think!

590
00:53:54,850 --> 00:53:56,540
l know you're right, Honey...

591
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:00,610
...but Krishna will never leave
his grandma and come.

592
00:54:01,910 --> 00:54:03,540
She is his world.

593
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:07,410
But now you are a part
of his world too.

594
00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:14,070
l know. Now do as l say.

595
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:16,690
Call for Krishna!

596
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:19,580

He's coming!

600
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:31,590
Who's coming?

601
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:36,190
A boy? ls he an lndian?
Does he live here in Singapore?

602
00:54:36,490 --> 00:54:38,420
Have you finally chosen
someone, Priya?

603
00:54:38,590 --> 00:54:41,320
There you go again, Mom!
l haven't chosen anyone

604
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:42,620
So choose one!

605
00:54:42,790 --> 00:54:43,490

606
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:45,820
...please leave now,

607
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:46,830
And when will you settle down?

608
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:47,630
Tomorrow

609
00:54:47,810 --> 00:54:49,200
Call from Priya!

610
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:50,700
Priya?

611
00:54:51,670 --> 00:54:52,430
Hello, Krishna...

612
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:53,330
Priya...

613
00:54:54,950 --> 00:54:55,840
How are you?

614
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:59,260
l'm fine, but l don't like anything

615
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:01,440

Me too

620
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:16,750
He's not saying anything more than
'' Me too '', so what do l do?

621
00:55:16,910 --> 00:55:19,040
You continue reading,
read from here!

622
00:55:20,010 --> 00:55:21,740
Priya, why are you quiet?

623
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:25,940
Krishna, can't you come here
and meet my mother?

624
00:55:26,350 --> 00:55:27,220
Your mother?

625
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:30,440
Yes, if you don't meet my mother...

626
00:55:30,610 --> 00:55:33,380
...she'll get me married to
someone else.

627
00:55:34,630 --> 00:55:35,620
Someone else?

628
00:55:36,190 --> 00:55:38,280
No, l won't let that happen!

629
00:55:38,450 --> 00:55:40,920

630

00:55:47,730 --> 00:55:49,850
Yes... how will you get here?

632
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:54,580
Hello, Krishna! Don't worry.
Just give the phone to Bahadur?

633
00:56:09,090 --> 00:56:14,960
Krishna! Aircraft! Singapore!
Priya Ma'am!

634
00:56:15,130 --> 00:56:17,000

635

00:59:14,490 --> 00:59:18,710
''The world didn't matterto them
anymore''

649
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:24,770
''There was a boy
and there was a girl...''

650
00:59:26,510 --> 00:59:31,880
''she smiled, he smiled...''

651
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:38,450
''little did they know what
was happening''

652
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:42,990
''Come, let me tell you a love story''

653
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:49,550
''There was a boy and there was a girl...''

654
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:07,790
''There was no yearning,
there was no aching...''

655
01:00:07,970 --> 01:00:14,620
''they came together...
their hearts skipped a beat''

656
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:25,840
''There was no yearning,
there was no aching...''

657
01:00:26,010 --> 01:00:32,910
''they came together... their hearts
skipped a beat''

658
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:40,970
''What was destined happened...''

659
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:49,090
''They got lost in love''

660
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:53,600
''They got lost in love''

661
01:00:56,690 --> 01:01:00,740
''Oh, how one heart ruled the other!''

662
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:07,290
''There was a boy and there was a girl...''

663
01:01:15,930 --> 01:01:16,490
Grandma!

664
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:17,750
l am here

665
01:01:17,930 --> 01:01:19,430
Grandma!

666
01:01:20,590 --> 01:01:22,760
Grandma!

667
01:01:22,930 --> 01:01:23,750
Put me down

668
01:01:26,830 --> 01:01:27,990
What's the matter, Krishna?

669
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:30,160
You look very happy today.

670
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:32,930
Grandma, l got a call from Priya!

671
01:01:33,270 --> 01:01:35,280
You told me that she'd forget me?

672
01:01:35,610 --> 01:01:38,430
But it's not true, Grandma!
She misses me every moment.

673
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:41,770
She's always thinking of me!
And she keeps seeing me everywhere!

674
01:01:44,270 --> 01:01:47,270
And l nevertold you...

675
01:01:50,130 --> 01:01:51,610
...l've been in a similar state.

676
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:56,170
Ever since Priya has left,
l never liked anything.

677
01:01:58,050 --> 01:02:01,610
But today with her call,
l feel better.

678
01:02:02,380 --> 01:02:04,780
Grandma, Priya has called me
to Singapore

679
01:02:04,950 --> 01:02:06,460
She wants me to meet her mother.

680
01:02:06,950 --> 01:02:07,610
Her mother?

681
01:02:07,790 --> 01:02:08,440
Yes

682
01:02:08,610 --> 01:02:09,450
lf l don't go and ask for her hand...

683
01:02:09,610 --> 01:02:12,450
...her mother's going to get her
married to someone else

684
01:02:13,790 --> 01:02:15,950
l said l wouldn't let that happen,
l'm coming.

685
01:02:17,850 --> 01:02:20,780
l did the right thing, didn't l Grandma?
May l go, Grandma?

686
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:29,620
lt's only a matter of a few days, grandma

687
01:02:29,790 --> 01:02:33,130
l'll ask for Priya's hand in marriage
and bring her back with me

688
01:02:35,630 --> 01:02:36,720
May l go, Grandma?

689
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:43,020
You're not answering, Grandma

690
01:02:45,740 --> 01:02:48,290
When you've already decided to go...

691
01:02:49,530 --> 01:02:51,700
...why ask me?

692
01:02:52,630 --> 01:02:55,470
Go on. Go.

693
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:57,630
You aren't happy, Grandma?

694
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:01,300
Don't you like Priya?

695
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:04,290
l like Priya...

696
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:08,200
...but l don't like the idea
of you going so far.

697
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:11,730
lf Priya really loves you...

698
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:15,310
...she can also come here
with her mother

699
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:18,030
But you're not going there!

700
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:19,580
Why not?

701
01:03:21,070 --> 01:03:24,980
l said you're not going,
it means you're not going

702
01:03:26,980 --> 01:03:27,640
That's it!

703
01:03:27,980 --> 01:03:30,810
But why can't l go?
What's going to happen?

704
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:32,810
l've been hearing this since l was a child!

705
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:35,640
Don't go here, don't go there,
don't do this, don't do that...

706
01:03:35,820 --> 01:03:37,320
...don't go to the city with yourfriends!

707
01:03:37,930 --> 01:03:40,650
Forget the city, you don't even
allow me to go beyond the river...

708
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:41,590
Why?

709
01:03:44,820 --> 01:03:50,090
Now you've become so big that
l have to give explanations to you?

710
01:03:54,820 --> 01:03:56,490
You'll have to tell today, Grandma!

711
01:03:57,670 --> 01:03:58,890
Why do you keep stopping me?

712
01:03:59,330 --> 01:04:00,560
Why can't l go anywhere?

713
01:04:02,830 --> 01:04:06,170
Because l don't want to lose you

714
01:04:07,170 --> 01:04:08,490
So what do you want then?

715
01:04:08,830 --> 01:04:12,230
Cut me off from the world and
keep looking at yourface forever?

716
01:04:12,730 --> 01:04:14,660
Bang my head on trees
and mountains all my life...?

717
01:04:14,830 --> 01:04:17,160
You want me to be alone all my life?
ls that what you want?

718
01:04:24,510 --> 01:04:28,170
But l can't do l that, Grandma!
l have my own life too...

719
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:31,840
...my own dreams. l too want to
achieve something!

720
01:04:32,010 --> 01:04:33,500
l want an identity for myself!

721
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:41,840
You don't want to lose me,
even if l have to lose Priya

722
01:04:43,010 --> 01:04:45,170
You can't see me happy

723
01:04:46,690 --> 01:04:51,180
l have always obeyed you.
And you can't agree to my one request?

724
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:54,850
Today l realize, how selfish you are!

725
01:04:56,350 --> 01:04:59,350
You only think of yourself!
Only yourself!

726
01:05:00,350 --> 01:05:02,360
You don't care for me!

727
01:05:03,020 --> 01:05:06,690
Had my parents been alive,
they'd have understood my feelings!

728
01:05:06,850 --> 01:05:08,850
They'd have let me go,
they wouldn't have stopped me!

729
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:22,030
l wish your parents were alive.

730
01:05:24,030 --> 01:05:25,360
l wish!

731
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:54,940
l'm sorry, Grandma.

732
01:06:06,620 --> 01:06:08,710
See these stars, Krishna...

733
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:16,490
...with these infinite
twinkling stars in the sky...

734
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:23,310
...you, yourfather, your grandfather...

735
01:06:23,490 --> 01:06:25,460
...and l share a very deep relationship.

736
01:06:28,550 --> 01:06:30,890
Your grandfather was a space scientist

737
01:06:31,990 --> 01:06:38,450
One night, he started receiving a reply
to a signal he had sent to outer space

738
01:06:39,150 --> 01:06:41,290
Suddenly, we saw a flying saucer in the sky...

739
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:43,540
...the car swerved out of control

740
01:06:43,730 --> 01:06:46,560
l survived the accident...

741
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:48,230
...but your grandfather.

742
01:06:54,230 --> 01:06:56,300
l was pregnant with Rohit at that time...

743
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:00,730
...he had sustained a head injury
in the accident...

744
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:04,060
...because of which he was born abnormal.

745
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:10,400
...even when he grew up,
he had the l.Q. of a child.

746
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:16,420
One night, in our small town,
a huge spaceship descended.

747
01:07:18,810 --> 01:07:20,900
Some Aliens emerged from it...

748
01:07:21,580 --> 01:07:23,900
...but one could not go back.

749
01:07:24,910 --> 01:07:28,740
And that is how Rohit met Jadoo.

750
01:07:30,070 --> 01:07:33,400
Jadoo had supernatural powers...

751
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:37,590
...which he passed on to Rohit.

752
01:07:38,650 --> 01:07:40,680
Rohit changed completely.

753
01:07:42,190 --> 01:07:43,740
Jadoo eventually went away...

754
01:07:45,260 --> 01:07:50,190
...but he did not take back the powers
he had given to Rohit.

755
01:07:51,420 --> 01:07:56,260
And thereafter, everything changed forever.

756
01:07:57,600 --> 01:08:04,540
My son could do things that were impossible
for an ordinary human being.

757
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:10,460
lt was around then that Rohit
married your mother.

758
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:17,330
And very soon, his fame spread
across the world.

759
01:08:18,930 --> 01:08:23,090
The chairman of the world's largest
lnformation Technology Company...

760
01:08:24,110 --> 01:08:25,940
...invited Rohit abroad.

761
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:35,110
Thank You.

762
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:43,370
Welcome to Technotronics.

763
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:45,280
Come with me, Sir

764
01:08:54,790 --> 01:08:56,450
Dr Arya shall be here shortly

765
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:16,400
Mr. Rohit Mehra?

766
01:09:18,460 --> 01:09:20,120
l'm sorry to keep you waiting

767
01:09:20,790 --> 01:09:21,800
lt's all right, Sir.

768
01:09:22,130 --> 01:09:23,120
l was, this book...

769
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:28,960
Oh yes, that's the first copy of
my latest book.

770
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:31,360
Please read it and give your opinion.

771
01:09:31,790 --> 01:09:34,700
lt's a wonderful book, Sir.
You've done a lot of research.

772
01:09:35,470 --> 01:09:37,970
How can you say that without reading it?

773
01:09:38,130 --> 01:09:39,230
l've already read it, Sir.

774
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:42,310
Read it?

775
01:09:44,140 --> 01:09:48,100
There are printing errors on
page 126, 244 and 354

776
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:49,640
l've marked them.

777
01:09:50,370 --> 01:09:55,040
You've read this 400 page book
in just 10 minutes?

778
01:09:58,980 --> 01:10:01,580
l forgot who l was talking to.

779
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:05,810
Asking you such questions is
an insult to yourtalent.

780
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:08,480
lt's an honourto meet you.

781
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:10,910
The honour is mine, Sir.

782
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:13,470
l still can't believe...

783
01:10:13,820 --> 01:10:16,650
...that l'm standing face to face with a
great scientist and innovator like you.

784
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:19,480
Your achievements in the field of
wireless communication...

785
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:21,480
...is no less than a revolution, Sir.

786
01:10:21,890 --> 01:10:25,130
You've invented the palmtop.

787
01:10:25,690 --> 01:10:29,890
People can watch cricket matches
on their phones, thanks to you.

788
01:10:33,330 --> 01:10:37,480
l have a new dream, Rohit. A new vision...

789
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:46,270
...lf this dream comes true, it could change
the destiny of the world.

790
01:10:47,670 --> 01:10:51,330
And l need your help to realise this dream.

791
01:10:53,010 --> 01:10:58,660
l want to build a computer
that can see the future.

792
01:10:58,830 --> 01:11:00,270
That can see the future.

793
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:04,000
Future?

794
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:07,900
What would you like, tea or coffee?

795
01:11:16,580 --> 01:11:19,840
l understand your dream, your vision, Sir.

796
01:11:21,610 --> 01:11:26,180
You want to combine astrology,
astronomy and technology...

797
01:11:26,610 --> 01:11:30,170
...to build a computerthat can see the future.

798
01:11:30,340 --> 01:11:34,080
Exactly! That's precisely
why l've called you here.

799
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:38,510
Because the people l have here are trained...

800
01:11:39,620 --> 01:11:41,520
...not gifted like you.

801
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:57,350
What are you thinking, Rohit?

802
01:11:59,090 --> 01:12:06,630
Sir, if we can really build a computer
that can see the future then...

803
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:12,690
Then, think of the good we can do
forthis planet and mankind!

804
01:12:12,860 --> 01:12:14,200
Wars can be prevented

805
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:18,460
Earthquakes, famines, floods,
can be prevented.

806
01:12:18,630 --> 01:12:21,530
Even if we can't prevent them,
we can at least be prepared forthem.

807
01:12:21,710 --> 01:12:24,870
You've already started
seeing the future, Rohit.

808
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:26,710
Welcome!

809
01:12:27,540 --> 01:12:33,530
ln the hope that this union of brilliance
and vision will become history.

810
01:12:34,370 --> 01:12:35,880
Create history!

811
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:41,440
lt took him two whole years...

812
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:47,210
...but Rohit achieved the impossible...

813
01:12:48,710 --> 01:12:53,540
...he built a computer
that could see the future...

814
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:59,880
...lt was around the time
when you were going to be born.

815
01:13:00,210 --> 01:13:02,870
Hello?- Mom?

816
01:13:03,060 --> 01:13:04,720
Rohit, l've brought Nisha to the hospital.

817
01:13:04,890 --> 01:13:06,050
That's where l'm calling from.

818
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:09,320
Congratulations! You're going to
become a father anytime.

819
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:12,780
Come back soon.

820
01:13:12,970 --> 01:13:15,060
l'm coming, Mom...l'm coming!

821
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:22,050
Rohit? What's the matter?
You sound tense.

822
01:13:22,290 --> 01:13:26,390
l've been exploited. The world is very selfish

823
01:13:26,730 --> 01:13:30,130
But don't worry! l'll be back soon!

824
01:13:31,390 --> 01:13:33,560
But my son did not come back.

825
01:13:36,310 --> 01:13:40,800
Moments afteryou were born,
we received word

826
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:45,410
...that a fire broke out in the lab...

827
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:52,390
...and they couldn't save Rohit.

828
01:13:56,170 --> 01:13:58,730
Your mother couldn't bearthe shock...

829
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:03,330
...and passed away in a few days.

830
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:08,740
When you were five years old...

831
01:14:10,910 --> 01:14:15,750
...l got to know that you too were
born with extraordinary powers...

832
01:14:16,150 --> 01:14:20,580
...that Rohit had. l got scared.

833
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:29,760
l didn't want the world to know about you.

834
01:14:30,690 --> 01:14:33,690
And that's why l brought you here...

835
01:14:34,590 --> 01:14:36,260
...a place where nobody knew us.

836
01:14:38,420 --> 01:14:42,910
l didn't want to lose you at any cost, Krishna.

837
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:48,860
You no longer want to see my face...

838
01:14:51,770 --> 01:14:55,260
...but l'm living only foryou, Krishna

839
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:04,700
Yes, l'm selfish, very selfish.

840
01:15:41,790 --> 01:15:43,350
Grandma? What are you doing?

841
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:47,120
l've taken out some of
yourfather's clothes.

842
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:51,450
You can't go to Singapore like this!

843
01:15:54,790 --> 01:15:57,120
But Grandma?

844
01:16:00,790 --> 01:16:02,950
l could shield you from the world...

845
01:16:04,130 --> 01:16:05,700
...but not your heart.

846
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:11,130
Go, bring Priya here.

847
01:16:15,130 --> 01:16:16,400
Krishna...

848
01:16:19,460 --> 01:16:21,060
...stay carefully there

849
01:16:21,810 --> 01:16:26,810
Eat and sleep on time,
don't talk too much with anybody.

850
01:16:27,630 --> 01:16:29,470
And don't get into any trouble...

851
01:16:30,370 --> 01:16:34,610
...whateveryou do, make sure you
behave like any other man.

852
01:16:35,980 --> 01:16:41,570
Don't get carried away to do things
that make people realise...

853
01:16:43,570 --> 01:16:46,630
Who l am? Right, Grandma?

854
01:16:48,210 --> 01:16:49,150
Yes, my son.

855
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:52,480
Don't worry, Grandma.

856
01:16:53,420 --> 01:16:55,820
l won't let anybody know about me.

857
01:16:56,750 --> 01:17:02,470
l'll keep my strength, my abilities
and my talent... hidden.

858
01:17:06,490 --> 01:17:07,980
That's a promise, Grandma.

859
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:40,510
Welcome to Singapore, Sir.
- Thank you.

860
01:17:41,330 --> 01:17:45,670
Your welcome sounds different...
and nicer, today.

861
01:18:31,350 --> 01:18:32,020
Good afternoon, sir.

862
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:34,030
A very good afternoon, Dr. Mathur.

863
01:18:37,030 --> 01:18:39,360
But sir...
-Yes, yes, l know...

864
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:43,590
l've come a few days in advance.
But l couldn't help it.

865
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:44,790
l've waited so many years...

866
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:47,630
...but now that we're so close to success...

867
01:18:47,860 --> 01:18:52,030
...being patient is very difficult.

868
01:18:52,540 --> 01:18:55,540
Must say you and yourteam deserve credit...

869
01:18:55,700 --> 01:18:58,530
...for making my dream come true again.

870
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:02,130
Sir, the credit goes to Rohit Mehra...

871
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:05,710
lf it wasn't for his notes and research...

872
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:08,700
...it was impossible to build
that computer again.

873
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:13,380
Absolute genius!-You're right, sir

874
01:19:14,210 --> 01:19:16,710
The computerthat Rohit made in 2 years...

875
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:19,040
...has taken us so many years to make.

876
01:19:21,470 --> 01:19:24,380
That's why l still miss him.

877
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:27,210
Excuse me

878
01:19:45,890 --> 01:19:52,250
People say ''Who has seen the future?''

879
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:59,260
But in a few days, you and l...

880
01:20:00,060 --> 01:20:05,000
...will change this forever.

881
01:20:06,830 --> 01:20:09,490
Breaking news!

882
01:20:09,690 --> 01:20:12,990
Afteryears of struggle, hard work,
research and patience...

883
01:20:13,130 --> 01:20:19,190
...Dr. Siddhant Arya's most ambitious project
is about to be completed.

884
01:20:19,730 --> 01:20:23,710
According to our correspondent,
in just a few days...

885
01:20:23,870 --> 01:20:28,030
...Dr Arya will be able to predict the future of
individuals, countries and the world!

886
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:30,300
He'll also be able to change the
course of their destinies.

887
01:20:30,470 --> 01:20:33,950
And the truth is, one who can see
and change the future...

888
01:20:34,110 --> 01:20:36,500
...is considered like God!

889
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:40,100
Wrong!

890
01:20:41,770 --> 01:20:44,610
Not Like God...

891
01:20:45,350 --> 01:20:48,350
He is God!

892
01:20:50,110 --> 01:20:53,990
l will be God.

893
01:20:54,950 --> 01:20:58,250
Now no one can stop me.

894
01:21:33,100 --> 01:21:35,910
We're already late and then
this is how you park the car?

895
01:21:36,110 --> 01:21:38,040
l can't even open the door!
How am l going to get out?

896
01:21:38,230 --> 01:21:40,210
But neither can l!

897
01:21:40,270 --> 01:21:45,470
Great! Let's just sit in the car
and stare at each other!

898
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:48,430
You always mess things up!
Krishna's flight must have landed...

899
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:50,730
...he must be looking for us.

900
01:22:17,220 --> 01:22:18,710
l'm sorry, Sir!

901
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:20,580
You're not hurt, are you?

902
01:22:41,660 --> 01:22:42,380
Krishna

903
01:22:50,160 --> 01:22:54,000
Krishna, you're looking
is so good in these clothes.

904
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:57,360
They are my fathers.

905
01:22:58,660 --> 01:23:02,250
Krishna, welcome to Singapore!

906
01:23:02,630 --> 01:23:05,840
O my god! You look so handsome!

907
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:08,600
You two have come alone?

908
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:11,070
How can two people be 'alone'?

909
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:15,510
No! l mean, hasn't your mother
come with you?

910
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:16,510
Mother?

911
01:23:16,850 --> 01:23:18,170
ls she also coming here?

912
01:23:18,510 --> 01:23:19,670
lt would've been nice if she were here.

913
01:23:20,010 --> 01:23:24,280
l'd have asked foryour hand and
gone back to lndia immediately.

914
01:23:24,950 --> 01:23:26,250
Grandma's all alone, you see.

915
01:23:27,370 --> 01:23:28,840
He's in a tearing hurry!

916
01:23:29,010 --> 01:23:31,300
Has he brought a priest along to
solemnise the wedding?

917
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:32,100
Shut up!

918
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:33,620
What happened?

919
01:23:33,790 --> 01:23:37,550
Well actually, Mom, you know...

920
01:23:37,710 --> 01:23:39,450
Her mom's gone.

921
01:23:39,620 --> 01:23:40,680
Yeah she's gone...

922
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:41,770
Gone?

923
01:23:42,460 --> 01:23:43,980
To Hong Kong

924
01:23:44,150 --> 01:23:44,960
Yes, Hong Kong!

925
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:45,860
Hong Kong?

926
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:48,610
She'll be back in 10-15 days

927
01:23:48,780 --> 01:23:49,950
Yes, she'll come.

928
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:54,320
10-15 days? But what will l do here
for so many days?

929
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:58,610
Why Krishna? Didn't you take us around
your village when we came there?

930
01:23:58,790 --> 01:24:00,660
Now we'll show you our city.

931
01:24:04,230 --> 01:24:05,500
This is your apartment.

932
01:24:05,900 --> 01:24:07,690
This is your living room.

933
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:09,860
This is your bedroom

934
01:24:10,130 --> 01:24:12,180
And these clothes are foryou

935
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:13,930
This is your cell phone.

936
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:16,030
lt has all our numbers.

937
01:24:16,370 --> 01:24:18,420
You can call us anytime.

938
01:24:20,870 --> 01:24:24,370
But why can't l live with you
in your house, Priya?

939
01:24:25,740 --> 01:24:26,600
Well...

940
01:24:26,940 --> 01:24:29,370
Because mom...
- ...is not around

941
01:24:29,540 --> 01:24:31,830
Yes! Mom's not around
wouldn't be proper

942
01:24:35,980 --> 01:24:37,030
Hey! My phone is ringing!

943
01:24:37,670 --> 01:24:39,540
lt says 'Mama' how do l take the call?

944
01:24:39,940 --> 01:24:43,040
Looks like l gave you my cell phone
by mistake, Excuse me.

945
01:24:43,240 --> 01:24:45,510
Hello Priya, l have good news!

946
01:24:45,890 --> 01:24:47,350
l've found a boy foryou.

947
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:49,980
l'm busy right now.
l'll call you later, Mama.

948
01:24:50,150 --> 01:24:51,700
lt was your mom's call?
Let me say hello to her.

949
01:24:51,890 --> 01:24:53,480
No, it wasn't mom

950
01:24:53,650 --> 01:24:56,180
lt was my uncle.

951
01:24:56,990 --> 01:24:58,250
l could've said hello to him.

952
01:24:58,410 --> 01:24:59,820
Does he live here too?

953
01:24:59,980 --> 01:25:00,710
Yes...

954
01:25:01,410 --> 01:25:03,850
No! He lives in lndia.

955
01:25:04,020 --> 01:25:05,750
l see, where in lndia?

956
01:25:06,150 --> 01:25:08,480
Krishna, we've got to go to office.

957
01:25:08,660 --> 01:25:11,350
We'll give you her uncle's address later.

958
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:14,290
with pin code. But we've got to leave now. Bye!

959
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:17,490
Bye!- Bye

960
01:25:19,020 --> 01:25:21,540
How many lies do we have
to speak to cover up one lie?

961
01:25:21,740 --> 01:25:24,170
The excuse of an uncle saved us today!
- Tomorrow it'll be an aunt!

962
01:25:24,330 --> 01:25:26,660
There is no dearth of relatives. Relax!

963
01:25:27,420 --> 01:25:29,020
Did you see his eyes?

964
01:25:29,660 --> 01:25:31,680
They were full of love and trust.

965
01:25:32,390 --> 01:25:33,870
Honey, l can't do this!

966
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:35,840
l can't hurt Krishna anymore.

967
01:25:36,010 --> 01:25:39,440
Hurt? He's going to become a
celebrity thanks to you.

968
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:41,320
And we'll get a promotion.

969
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:45,380
And even if he gets to know,
a small lie is not going to hurt him

970
01:25:47,630 --> 01:25:48,500
What happened?

971
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:53,570
You? How did you get here from the 20th floor?

972

973
01:25:54,570 --> 01:25:56,010
Stairs?

Close your eyes.

978
01:26:20,090 --> 01:26:23,890
Priya, why do you widen your eyes
whenever l ask you to close them?

979
01:26:28,820 --> 01:26:29,720
Open them now

980
01:26:33,790 --> 01:26:36,130
May l put it on yourfinger?

981

Give me your hand

982

Ten days will go by in no time.

1006
01:30:30,190 --> 01:30:32,790
Tell me how are you finding it there?

1007
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:33,930
lts very nice, Grandma.

1008
01:30:34,090 --> 01:30:35,560
There are a lot of high rise buildings here.

1009
01:30:35,730 --> 01:30:38,250
And my apartment is on the 20th floor...

1010
01:30:38,420 --> 01:30:40,970
And l'm talking to you from the balcony right now.

1011
01:30:41,960 --> 01:30:43,960
Ok, ok, take care of yourself.

1012
01:30:44,120 --> 01:30:47,530
And give my love and blessings to Priya.

1013
01:30:47,860 --> 01:30:50,990
Just imagine! That's the
name of our new show.

1014
01:30:51,170 --> 01:30:57,500
Can you imagine a human being
climbing a tree fasterthan a monkey?

1015
01:30:57,660 --> 01:31:01,750
No... isn't it? Well after watching
our show today.

1016
01:31:01,930 --> 01:31:05,460
You won't just imagine,
but also believe that is possible.

1017
01:31:05,640 --> 01:31:09,930
Get set then! On one end is the
world famous orangutan Mao...

1018
01:31:10,470 --> 01:31:13,450
....who in a blink, will climb this pole.

1019
01:31:13,610 --> 01:31:16,310
And on the other side is
lndian superboy Krishna!

1020
01:31:17,670 --> 01:31:18,370
What's happening here, Priya?

1021
01:31:18,540 --> 01:31:19,240
What happened?

1022
01:31:19,410 --> 01:31:21,370
You brought me here to watch a shoot!

1023
01:31:21,550 --> 01:31:25,520
True. But then l thought if you can watch a shoot,
you can even perform in it!

1024
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:28,040
But how can l climb the pole fasterthan Mao?

1025
01:31:28,200 --> 01:31:31,430
Like you climbed the mountain!
The zigzag manner...remember?

1026
01:31:31,610 --> 01:31:33,890
But what if l lose to Mao?

1027
01:31:34,050 --> 01:31:35,920
l'm sure you won't.

1028
01:31:36,090 --> 01:31:37,140
But what if l do?

1029
01:31:37,710 --> 01:31:38,310
well...

1030
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:40,480
l'll marry Mao then.

1031
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:44,920
No! l'll never let that happen.

1032
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:47,380
So do it please! lt'll be great fun.

1033
01:31:53,850 --> 01:31:54,860
Fun it will be.

1034
01:31:55,820 --> 01:31:57,550
Sir we're ready

1035
01:31:57,720 --> 01:31:58,380
Ready is it?

1036
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:00,070
Chao, is Mao ready?

1037
01:32:00,230 --> 01:32:01,150
Ready

1038
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:03,900
Krishna...Ready?

1039
01:32:05,970 --> 01:32:09,730
Priya, there's just a pole's distance
between us and our success!

1040
01:32:09,890 --> 01:32:11,760
Not a pole, it's just a moment. Stupid!

1041
01:32:11,930 --> 01:32:13,030
Taking

1042
01:32:25,240 --> 01:32:26,210
Roll camera

1043
01:32:27,770 --> 01:32:28,540

1044
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:36,470
Cut!

1045
01:32:40,340 --> 01:32:42,670
What the hell is this?

1046
01:32:42,980 --> 01:32:45,070
Boss, it's all about brotherhood

1047
01:32:45,250 --> 01:32:46,430
Shut up!

1048
01:32:46,590 --> 01:32:47,670
Sorry, Sir

1049
01:32:48,410 --> 01:32:49,920
Come on Mao, come on

1050
01:32:50,110 --> 01:32:52,250
Roll camera... Action

1051
01:32:56,020 --> 01:32:56,710
Cut!

1052
01:32:59,380 --> 01:33:03,080
You stupid ape! l've paid a lot
of money foryou, okay?

1053
01:33:03,250 --> 01:33:05,260
And l'm tired of you monkeying around

1054
01:33:05,420 --> 01:33:08,750
You don't get your act together;
you're out of my show. Okay?

1055
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:14,770
l've straightened a lot of these smart alecs

1056
01:33:25,230 --> 01:33:26,280
Roll camera!

1057
01:33:27,320 --> 01:33:28,050
Action.

1058
01:33:36,870 --> 01:33:38,170
Where is the fish?

1059
01:33:38,630 --> 01:33:39,260
Cut!

1060
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:50,230
Roll camera!

1061

1062
01:34:08,740 --> 01:34:10,400
l'm not going to the circus with you.

1063
01:34:10,580 --> 01:34:13,350
Strange! Why vent your
anger against Mao, on me?

1064
01:34:13,510 --> 01:34:15,490
How can l help it if he refused
to climb the pole?

1065
01:34:15,750 --> 01:34:19,230
And the fish...instead of
coming into my hand...

1066
01:34:19,410 --> 01:34:21,730
They palmed off a can, a shoe and that...

1067
01:34:22,620 --> 01:34:24,790
Wow! Priya smile!

1068
01:34:31,750 --> 01:34:34,280
ln lndia you caught the fish so easily!

1069
01:34:34,450 --> 01:34:37,080
Actually those fish knew me,
they stood by me.

1070
01:34:37,240 --> 01:34:39,380
But you're not standing by me!

1071
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:43,690
l've come to stand by you for life, Priya.

1072
01:34:44,420 --> 01:34:46,980
For life? When my mother asks
you what you do?

1073
01:34:47,160 --> 01:34:48,490
What will you say?

1074
01:34:48,650 --> 01:34:49,850
l'll tell her what l do

1075
01:34:50,350 --> 01:34:51,350
Love you.

1076
01:34:53,690 --> 01:34:54,720
And...what else will you say?

1077

l'll fulfill all your wishes, look afteryou.

1078
01:34:59,320 --> 01:35:00,140
And...?

1079
01:35:01,590 --> 01:35:03,960
l'll never let a smile leave yourface.

1080
01:35:10,260 --> 01:35:11,050
And..?

1081
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:13,670
Whethertimes good or bad
we'll always be together.

1082
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:16,560
just like eyelashes are with the eyes.

1083
01:35:18,420 --> 01:35:19,260
And...?

1084
01:35:19,860 --> 01:35:23,130
You will dream and l'll fulfill them.

1085
01:35:25,630 --> 01:35:26,420
And...?

1086
01:35:26,730 --> 01:35:28,730
ln the scorching heat of the sun,
l'll be your shade.

1087
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:31,480
and in the cold, l'll give you warmth.

1088
01:35:32,490 --> 01:35:34,870
When the rains botheryou, l'll change
the course of the clouds.

1089
01:35:35,510 --> 01:35:38,200
and when a storm blows...
l'll turn the winds away.

1090
01:35:47,570 --> 01:35:49,800
That's how l shall protect
you all my life...

1091
01:35:50,950 --> 01:35:51,950
from every danger.

1092
01:35:52,940 --> 01:35:54,210
from every trouble.

1093
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:02,750
Now l hope your mother will agree?

Who...who are you?

1170
01:45:53,510 --> 01:45:54,380
Krrish

1171
01:45:57,820 --> 01:45:58,550
Friend

1172
01:46:00,030 --> 01:46:00,890
Friend

1173
01:47:13,850 --> 01:47:14,590
Priya!

1174
01:47:16,720 --> 01:47:17,780
Are you all right?

1175
01:47:18,850 --> 01:47:20,000
But how did you get here?

1176
01:47:20,180 --> 01:47:21,380
You had fainted.

1177
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:23,720
l had gone to get some waterforyou...

1178
01:47:24,190 --> 01:47:26,240
God! What a blaze! Come,
let's go home.

1179
01:47:37,820 --> 01:47:39,910
The most sensational news in
Singapore right now

1180
01:47:40,100 --> 01:47:43,300
is the circus blaze at Marina Bay
which took place last night

1181
01:47:43,460 --> 01:47:48,090
and the daredevil masked man saviour who, in a
flash, rescued many victims trapped in the fire

1182
01:47:48,260 --> 01:47:53,560
and has become every child's hero overnight but
his identity is still shrouded in mystery.

1183
01:47:53,960 --> 01:47:57,760
Till yesterday, we only had a description
and a picture of the masked man.

1184
01:47:58,200 --> 01:47:59,860
Today, we've got to know his name

1185
01:48:00,040 --> 01:48:04,310
and also got a piece of his mask.
Let's find out how.

1186
01:48:05,140 --> 01:48:06,690
He said his name is Krrish

1187
01:48:06,860 --> 01:48:09,830
and this piece of the mask broke
from his forehead.

1188
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:11,300
So his name is Krrish!

1189
01:48:11,470 --> 01:48:12,340
KRRlSH!

1190
01:48:12,500 --> 01:48:15,380
But his identity is still shrouded
in mystery.

1191
01:48:15,540 --> 01:48:22,950
Whoever Krrish is, a bravery award
and cash reward of 25000 dollars...

1192
01:48:23,110 --> 01:48:24,590
has been announced in appreciation
of his courage.

1193
01:48:24,750 --> 01:48:26,910
So how are we going to identify Krrish?

1194
01:48:27,070 --> 01:48:31,310
The one, whose mask this piece matches with,
will be considered to be Krrish.

1195
01:48:31,480 --> 01:48:34,150
And he'll be the one to be rewarded.

1196
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:38,410
Krrish! Krrish! After all who is this Krrish?

1197
01:48:39,480 --> 01:48:42,980
Listen carefully, our priority
at the moment is Krrish.

1198
01:48:43,110 --> 01:48:46,320
Only Krrish! Get that?

1199
01:48:46,550 --> 01:48:48,580
Krrish's identity...

1200
01:48:48,790 --> 01:48:52,090
Our channel should be the
first to reveal him!

1201
01:48:52,260 --> 01:48:53,630
Do you get that?

1202
01:49:03,090 --> 01:49:07,780
Our channel must be the first one to
unmask this masked Krrish!

1203
01:49:08,160 --> 01:49:12,640
Get it? Stop nodding and leave!
Go, get him! Go, go!

1204
01:49:15,640 --> 01:49:17,330
Where are the two of you going?

1205
01:49:17,490 --> 01:49:18,690
To look for Krrish.

1206
01:49:18,860 --> 01:49:22,130
Ah, forget Krrish. And look for a new job.

1207
01:49:22,700 --> 01:49:23,570
New job...?

1208
01:49:24,470 --> 01:49:25,630
You both are fired.

1209
01:49:25,800 --> 01:49:26,630
What?

1210
01:49:27,890 --> 01:49:28,910
You better go back to lndia...

1211
01:49:29,110 --> 01:49:32,070
and enjoy your Krishna's flute playing.

1212
01:49:32,580 --> 01:49:34,410
Don't waste yourtime, Go, go!

1213
01:49:35,350 --> 01:49:36,400
Out!

1214
01:49:37,940 --> 01:49:40,280
Thanks to Krishna we're jobless.

1215
01:49:40,640 --> 01:49:42,080
Now what do we do?

1216
01:49:42,980 --> 01:49:48,810
Honey, l think Krrish is none other
than our own Krishna.

1217
01:49:49,250 --> 01:49:50,170
What?

1218
01:49:50,570 --> 01:49:51,140
Yes, Honey!

1219
01:49:52,510 --> 01:49:55,640
At the circus, l saw Krrish from
such a close distance.

1220
01:49:56,660 --> 01:49:59,940
l have a strong feeling that Krishna is Krrish.

1221
01:50:01,150 --> 01:50:04,160
So why didn't you tell this to
boss at the meeting?

1222
01:50:04,320 --> 01:50:08,650
Because l wasn't sure, l need
to confirm it first.

1223
01:50:08,910 --> 01:50:10,650
Confirm? How?

1224
01:50:12,250 --> 01:50:15,020
Listen, l have an idea...

1225
01:51:22,610 --> 01:51:23,480
Honey, these guys...?

1226
01:51:23,650 --> 01:51:25,610
Priya! l've hired some actors.
But l'm a bit late...

1227
01:51:25,780 --> 01:51:26,870
l'll be there soon.

1228
01:51:27,040 --> 01:51:27,710
What?

1229
01:51:30,960 --> 01:51:31,920
So who are these guys?

1230
01:51:33,290 --> 01:51:36,190
Oh my God! Help!

1231
01:51:56,760 --> 01:51:58,520
This is now mine...bye!

1232
01:52:07,430 --> 01:52:10,960
l'm so sorry, Krishna. l'm so sorry.

1233
01:52:11,970 --> 01:52:17,300
l thought you were Krrish and
planned my own kidnapping.

1234
01:52:19,040 --> 01:52:22,880
But then, real goons turned up
instead of the hired ones.

1235
01:52:24,950 --> 01:52:25,910
Real goons?

1236
01:52:30,510 --> 01:52:32,480
But why didn't you hit back?

1237
01:52:35,440 --> 01:52:37,700
Why did you quietly take their beating?

1238
01:52:40,440 --> 01:52:41,470
l wanted to see...

1239
01:52:43,590 --> 01:52:48,980
whether it hurts you to see me in pain.

1240
01:52:53,150 --> 01:52:53,990
lt does.

1241
01:53:06,950 --> 01:53:07,980
Where's your ring?

1242
01:53:09,590 --> 01:53:11,000
Maybe they've...

1243
01:54:00,350 --> 01:54:04,050
Who's he? Why's he here?

1244
01:54:05,280 --> 01:54:08,180
l think he's the masked man.

1245
01:54:10,280 --> 01:54:12,680
Masked man?

1246
01:54:26,920 --> 01:54:27,820
Get him.

1247
01:55:52,290 --> 01:55:53,720
l'm sorry, sorry.

1248
01:56:34,310 --> 01:56:36,800
My friend Krrish!

1249
01:56:39,630 --> 01:56:44,080
l'll tell everyone, l'll tell my sister.

1250
01:56:44,250 --> 01:56:48,340
No, Kristian. Don't tell anyone.

1251
01:56:48,520 --> 01:56:54,110
Why? You become famous!
You'll get the reward.

1252
01:56:58,580 --> 01:57:01,920
Here, Kristian. You become Krrish.

1253
01:57:05,850 --> 01:57:11,420
Take it. Get the money foryour sister.

1254
01:57:13,020 --> 01:57:14,390
Make her legs good again.

1255
01:57:16,920 --> 01:57:17,750
Take it!

1256
01:57:24,930 --> 01:57:29,920
No, it's yours. You are the hero.

1257
01:57:31,770 --> 01:57:35,750
Every human being who fights for a
good cause is a hero, Kristian.

1258
01:57:37,030 --> 01:57:39,550
You... are fighting foryour sister.

1259
01:57:42,200 --> 01:57:43,430
You are a hero.

1260
01:57:48,710 --> 01:57:49,930
The biggest news of today!

1261
01:57:50,100 --> 01:57:52,900
Superhero Krrish has revealed his
identity to the media...

1262
01:57:53,070 --> 01:57:55,370
and the broken piece of the mask
fitting his mask

1263
01:57:55,550 --> 01:57:57,330
has confirmed his identity

1264
01:57:57,540 --> 01:58:01,100
Here today, Hero Honda is honouring
Krrish for his bravery

1265
01:58:03,840 --> 01:58:04,410
Well done young man.

1266
01:58:04,580 --> 01:58:05,160
Thank you

1267
01:58:24,490 --> 01:58:28,600
Not once did it occurto me that
Kristian could also be Krrish!

1268
01:58:28,790 --> 01:58:30,690
He was also there at the circus that night!

1269
01:58:31,720 --> 01:58:34,660
Had it struck me that night

1270
01:58:34,820 --> 01:58:36,380
l wouldn't have got a thrashing!

1271
01:58:38,480 --> 01:58:40,580
l've said sorry, haven't l?

1272
01:58:40,880 --> 01:58:42,120
What else do you want me to do?

1273
01:58:44,530 --> 01:58:45,680
Close your eyes...

1274
01:58:46,790 --> 01:58:48,050
again you...

1275
01:58:53,700 --> 01:58:54,630
Now open them.

1276
01:58:56,660 --> 01:58:58,080
How did you get it back?

1277
01:58:58,260 --> 01:59:00,660
Krrish, he's my friend.

1278
01:59:01,030 --> 01:59:02,000
Wouldn't he do this much for me?

1279
01:59:05,730 --> 01:59:06,990
Thank you, thank you

1280
01:59:16,730 --> 01:59:17,300
Take it

1281
01:59:18,640 --> 01:59:20,900
Won't you put it on my finger?

Priya, you're watching TV here and there boss has
ordered to vacate Krishna's apartment.

1337
02:05:07,880 --> 02:05:10,850
Hello! Are you listening?

02:05:10,980 --> 02:05:13,540
l am & am not.

1339
02:05:20,680 --> 02:05:22,210
What's this?

1340
02:05:23,110 --> 02:05:25,340
Rememberthe explosion at the circus?

1341
02:05:25,780 --> 02:05:28,900
l had passed out, but l think the
camera was still on.

1342
02:05:29,880 --> 02:05:33,320
Now switch off the TV and think
about Krishna! Please!

1343
02:05:38,620 --> 02:05:39,750
Oh my god!

1344
02:05:41,720 --> 02:05:42,590
What happened?

1345
02:05:42,760 --> 02:05:44,260
l'll rewind and show you.

1346
02:06:01,670 --> 02:06:03,260
Krishna is Krrish!

02:06:12,200 --> 02:06:13,540
Why are you girls screaming?

1349
02:06:14,700 --> 02:06:15,320
Where are you both going?

1350
02:06:15,500 --> 02:06:16,290
Mom Office! l'll see you okay.

1351
02:06:16,460 --> 02:06:16,970
Office?

1352
02:06:17,130 --> 02:06:18,020
Come on Honey

1353
02:06:18,210 --> 02:06:19,070
To get our jobs back!

1354
02:06:19,240 --> 02:06:20,100
Ok bye!

1355
02:06:21,980 --> 02:06:23,610
Priya, your mobile.

1356
02:06:24,610 --> 02:06:25,470
Hello Priya?

1357
02:06:26,050 --> 02:06:27,730
No, l'm Priya's mother

1358
02:06:29,310 --> 02:06:32,110
Mother...hello.

1359
02:06:32,540 --> 02:06:34,380
When did you return from Hong Kong?

1360
02:06:34,650 --> 02:06:38,620
Hong Kong? l didn't go anywhere...
l've been right here

1361
02:06:38,810 --> 02:06:40,640
And who are you?

1362
02:06:41,370 --> 02:06:44,350
lt's me, Krishna.

1363
02:06:44,790 --> 02:06:45,980
Krishna, who?

1364
02:06:48,020 --> 02:06:51,220
Priya has told you everything about me,
hasn't she?

1365
02:06:51,780 --> 02:06:55,050
No, Priya has said nothing about you.

1366
02:06:59,380 --> 02:07:01,410
You are Priya's mother aren't you?

1367
02:07:01,820 --> 02:07:03,850
Yes...l'm Priya's mother.

1368
02:07:05,880 --> 02:07:06,850
Where's Priya?

1369
02:07:07,020 --> 02:07:08,780
Priya left for office just now.

1370
02:07:11,060 --> 02:07:12,400
Office...

1371
02:07:12,560 --> 02:07:13,570
Right... Thank you

1372
02:07:18,220 --> 02:07:24,990
Priya, do you realise? Once this
footage is telecast....

1373
02:07:26,460 --> 02:07:30,690
Our Krishna will become a
world famous celebrity!

1374
02:07:31,700 --> 02:07:33,730
There's something about our Krishna!

1375
02:07:34,070 --> 02:07:36,430
He fooled us so convincingly.

1376
02:07:36,600 --> 02:07:39,700
ln lndia, as Kalicharan, and here, as Krrish!

1377
02:07:39,870 --> 02:07:43,000
Didn't l tell you Honey, the truth
always comes out?

1378
02:07:45,800 --> 02:07:49,070
Look Priya, the truth about Krishna
the world is about to discover...

1379
02:07:49,230 --> 02:07:50,430
...is because you lied!

1380
02:07:50,600 --> 02:07:54,900
The lie that you love him brought him
here all the way from lndia.

1381
02:07:55,080 --> 02:07:58,740
And imagine! Now we're going to
create a big sensation!

1382
02:07:59,740 --> 02:08:03,120
You're right. A lie sometimes leads
to very big gains.

1383
02:08:24,660 --> 02:08:27,080
You didn't even tell me!

1384
02:08:28,490 --> 02:08:29,690
What could l say?

1385
02:08:31,420 --> 02:08:35,950
When his honesty turned my feigned
love into a genuine one...

1386
02:08:38,020 --> 02:08:39,530
l didn't even realize

1387
02:08:42,830 --> 02:08:44,570
l'm in love with Krishna, Honey

1388
02:08:54,370 --> 02:08:56,420
Krishna, Krishna

1389
02:08:58,930 --> 02:09:00,600
The culprit has been caught at last!

1390
02:09:02,100 --> 02:09:05,190
He did his best to hide his identity, you know

1391
02:09:05,690 --> 02:09:09,230
But l finally discovered who the real Krrish is!

1392
02:09:10,540 --> 02:09:11,950
Why did you lie to me?

1393
02:09:13,110 --> 02:09:14,780
Why did you keep me in the dark?

1394
02:09:16,240 --> 02:09:19,140
Where was the need to hide behind
a mask, even with me?

1395
02:09:23,880 --> 02:09:25,140
You're asking this Priya?

1396
02:09:27,310 --> 02:09:29,170
Someone who has never been honest with me

1397
02:09:31,520 --> 02:09:33,780
Someone who kept me in the dark till today

1398
02:09:36,880 --> 02:09:38,580
l have been unmasked Priya.

1399
02:09:44,690 --> 02:09:45,680
What about you?

1400
02:09:48,110 --> 02:09:49,180
What do you mean?

1401
02:09:50,880 --> 02:09:53,190
Why did you lie to me that you loved me?

1402
02:09:55,150 --> 02:09:57,740
l took your lies forthe truth and came here.

1403
02:09:58,830 --> 02:10:00,530
to ask your motherforyour hand in marriage

1404
02:10:03,760 --> 02:10:06,130
But you lied about hertoo!

1405
02:10:08,070 --> 02:10:08,890
yes, Priya

1406
02:10:10,890 --> 02:10:12,700
l've spoken to your mother

1407
02:10:17,700 --> 02:10:18,460
Krishna...

1408
02:10:20,500 --> 02:10:21,460
l'm sorry

1409
02:10:24,070 --> 02:10:26,370
l admit, l lied to you in the beginning

1410
02:10:27,200 --> 02:10:27,990
But now...

1411
02:10:31,140 --> 02:10:32,970
l really love you Krishna

1412
02:10:33,140 --> 02:10:35,930
Stop it, Priya! Stop it!

1413
02:10:37,230 --> 02:10:39,430
you may have more lies to tell me

1414
02:10:41,400 --> 02:10:43,780
But l don't have the strength to take
them forthe truth anymore!

1415
02:10:43,950 --> 02:10:47,740
Listen to me, Krishna! l've done
all this only foryou

1416
02:10:47,920 --> 02:10:50,110
l wanted to see you become
a very big man

1417
02:10:50,280 --> 02:10:52,150
and that's about to happen in
just a few hours

1418
02:10:52,310 --> 02:10:54,610
the whole world will get to know about
your extraordinary powers and talent

1419
02:10:54,780 --> 02:10:56,180
that's exactly what l didn't want

1420
02:10:57,210 --> 02:10:59,810
Why do you think l wore the mask?

1421
02:11:01,080 --> 02:11:04,870
because l had promised grandma that
l'd keep my identity hidden

1422
02:11:05,710 --> 02:11:08,150
that l would not let anyone know
about my powers

1423
02:11:10,420 --> 02:11:11,360
and you

1424
02:11:16,720 --> 02:11:18,080
grandma was right

1425
02:11:19,150 --> 02:11:22,490
people in the world only use each other
fortheir own selfish reasons

1426
02:11:25,030 --> 02:11:26,420
She tried to stop me, but l...

1427
02:11:26,580 --> 02:11:28,960
But why does your grandmother
want to stop you?

1428
02:11:30,250 --> 02:11:33,170
Why does she always want you
in front of her eyes?

1429
02:11:34,800 --> 02:11:37,720
Why doesn't she want the whole
world to know of yourtalent?

1430
02:11:38,700 --> 02:11:39,500
ls she not being selfish?

1431
02:11:39,660 --> 02:11:40,400
Priya!

1432
02:11:44,840 --> 02:11:45,990
You really want to know?

1433
02:11:47,660 --> 02:11:48,670
Then listen!

1434
02:12:07,510 --> 02:12:12,000
having lost her son, grandma
did not want to lose me

1435
02:12:12,180 --> 02:12:13,650
because l posses the same powers

1436
02:12:21,180 --> 02:12:22,920
but she still let me come here

1437
02:12:25,190 --> 02:12:26,120
foryou

1438
02:12:27,910 --> 02:12:30,220
for my feelings, she gave in

1439
02:12:34,690 --> 02:12:36,520
But what do l tell her now?

1440
02:12:42,860 --> 02:12:45,220
Krishna, listen to me... Krishna!

1441
02:12:46,060 --> 02:12:48,500
Krishna...

1442
02:12:57,470 --> 02:12:59,160
Hello Honey

1443
02:12:59,290 --> 02:13:01,060
We've got to stop the telecast
of Krishna's tape

1444
02:13:01,190 --> 02:13:01,860
Why?

1445
02:13:02,460 --> 02:13:05,520
don't ask questions now, just
stop the telecast

1446
02:13:05,830 --> 02:13:07,910
but the tape is with boss

1447
02:13:09,600 --> 02:13:11,670
My god, where's boss?

1448
02:13:27,310 --> 02:13:31,500
l wish to thank all my investors
in Singapore

1449
02:13:32,210 --> 02:13:34,970
they are the ones who really
deserve this applause

1450
02:13:35,150 --> 02:13:37,760
for having had faith in my
various projects

1451
02:13:39,310 --> 02:13:43,550
l'm delighted to announce that
our company, Technotronics...

1452
02:13:43,750 --> 02:13:47,810
has made a profit of 400 million
dollars this year

1453
02:13:48,080 --> 02:13:51,610
l therefore announce100% dividend

1454
02:13:51,780 --> 02:13:53,810
to all our shareholders

1455
02:13:56,350 --> 02:13:57,970
Any questions?

1456
02:14:00,560 --> 02:14:01,290
Yes?

1457
02:14:03,420 --> 02:14:07,540
Dr. Arya, congratulations on the phenomenal
success of your company

1458
02:14:07,950 --> 02:14:09,150
my question is

1459
02:14:09,550 --> 02:14:13,030
20 years ago, you tried to make a computer

1460
02:14:13,190 --> 02:14:14,950
that could see the future

1461
02:14:17,030 --> 02:14:19,390
What happened to that dream of yours?

1462
02:14:23,170 --> 02:14:26,460
20 years ago, you must have had
a lot of dreams too...

1463
02:14:27,170 --> 02:14:28,670
Did they all come true?

1464
02:14:29,560 --> 02:14:30,160
Pardon me?

1465
02:14:31,230 --> 02:14:34,240
some questions hurt

1466
02:14:35,470 --> 02:14:37,460
the media ought to understand

1467
02:14:39,700 --> 02:14:46,360
that dream died with the death of my
genius friend, Rohit Mehra

1468
02:14:47,740 --> 02:14:51,180
But from what l've read and
heard of you, Dr. Arya...

1469
02:14:51,580 --> 02:14:53,450
you don't ever accept defeat

1470
02:14:53,710 --> 02:14:55,710
l'd have tried to win...

1471
02:14:57,110 --> 02:15:01,340
had my genius friend been alive

1472
02:15:03,910 --> 02:15:05,130
Any further questions?

1473
02:15:06,770 --> 02:15:07,740
excuse me

1474
02:15:07,910 --> 02:15:10,250
sir, l need to speak to that lady
for just one minute

1475
02:15:14,320 --> 02:15:15,080
Please!

1476
02:15:23,290 --> 02:15:24,050
Krishna

1477
02:15:31,930 --> 02:15:33,300
Anything left to say?

1478
02:15:36,160 --> 02:15:40,430
Yes...This gentleman has
something to say

1479
02:15:46,600 --> 02:15:47,350
Who are you?

1480
02:15:48,560 --> 02:15:49,930
My name is Vikram Sinha

1481
02:15:51,660 --> 02:15:52,600
What do you want?

1482
02:15:53,060 --> 02:15:58,600
Don't go back the way you came.

1483
02:15:59,540 --> 02:16:00,370
What does that mean?

1484
02:16:00,540 --> 02:16:03,170
l mean, you came alone

1485
02:16:03,940 --> 02:16:05,130
don't go back alone.

1486
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:14,170
Krishna, yourfather, Rohit Mehra,
is still alive.

1487
02:16:25,080 --> 02:16:25,980
What did you say?

1488
02:16:33,450 --> 02:16:38,010
This picture was taken when
yourfather worked for Dr Arya

1489
02:16:38,710 --> 02:16:41,550
And l was the Senior Security
Officer at Technotronics.

1490
02:16:42,650 --> 02:16:44,340
He was youngerto me in age,

1491
02:16:44,930 --> 02:16:46,780
and l was a junior in status.

1492
02:16:47,620 --> 02:16:49,320
And yet, we were very close friends.

1493
02:16:50,390 --> 02:16:52,400
not only because we were lndians

1494
02:16:53,530 --> 02:16:56,020
it was because of the sincerity in his smile

1495
02:16:57,720 --> 02:16:59,350
and the honesty in his eyes.

1496
02:17:01,390 --> 02:17:02,900
He was always smiling...

1497
02:17:06,940 --> 02:17:10,030
but someone cast an evil eye on him.

1498
02:17:11,730 --> 02:17:13,070
lt's been so many years,

1499
02:17:14,670 --> 02:17:15,860
but that time...

1500
02:17:17,360 --> 02:17:19,060
seems to have frozen.

1501
02:17:20,060 --> 02:17:22,470
That day, he was working till morning...

1502
02:17:22,970 --> 02:17:25,990
because he had to complete his
project and go back to lndia.

1503
02:17:26,490 --> 02:17:27,580
Good morning, chief

1504
02:17:28,730 --> 02:17:31,290
Mr. Vikram? Welcome!

1505
02:17:31,580 --> 02:17:32,570
How are you this morning?

1506
02:17:32,740 --> 02:17:34,150
l'm doing fine, chief

1507
02:17:34,650 --> 02:17:39,810
but if you keep working round the clock like this,
you're going to get insomnia

1508
02:17:41,210 --> 02:17:43,510
l won't have to do it aftertoday.

1509
02:17:44,510 --> 02:17:46,470
Once the computer is inaugurated today...

1510
02:17:46,700 --> 02:17:51,410
l'll hand it overto Dr Arya and return
to my family in lndia.

1511
02:17:53,080 --> 02:17:54,630
Don't mind, chief...

1512
02:17:54,990 --> 02:17:58,250
but l still can't believe that we
can see the future.

1513
02:17:58,520 --> 02:18:01,020
Not believing does not change
the truth, Mr. Vikram.

1514
02:18:01,950 --> 02:18:04,090
You will believe it, when you see it?

1515
02:18:04,250 --> 02:18:06,710
What? You mean you're going to...

1516
02:18:06,890 --> 02:18:07,910
Of course!

1517
02:18:09,180 --> 02:18:12,710
Come see tomorrow, today

1518
02:18:13,150 --> 02:18:16,210
and tell me how it feels to see the future.

1519
02:18:16,550 --> 02:18:17,440
Please hold this.

1520
02:18:39,990 --> 02:18:42,520
Retina scan, an identification of my eyes

1521
02:19:19,210 --> 02:19:21,780
These 2 identifications of mine are
the password forthis computer.

1522
02:19:21,950 --> 02:19:23,750
Without which, it won't start up.

1523
02:19:24,450 --> 02:19:29,010
But when you're not around, when
you've gone back to lndia?

1524
02:19:29,180 --> 02:19:31,690
l'll change the password before l leave

1525
02:19:31,860 --> 02:19:35,020
Afterthat, only Dr Arya will be able
to start the computer.

1526
02:19:38,120 --> 02:19:38,920
Tell me...

1527
02:19:40,190 --> 02:19:41,630
What would you like to see?

1528
02:19:41,890 --> 02:19:43,590
l...l don't want to see anything, chief!

1529
02:19:44,330 --> 02:19:46,780
But you said your wife is pregnant

1530
02:19:48,120 --> 02:19:52,150
Let's see whether l'm going to be an
uncle to a nephew or a niece?

1531
02:19:54,230 --> 02:19:57,460
Ok then...let's find out.

1532
02:20:25,600 --> 02:20:26,160
Nisha!

1533
02:20:30,240 --> 02:20:30,910
Nisha!

1534
02:20:32,510 --> 02:20:34,250
My darling baby...

1535
02:20:36,870 --> 02:20:40,140
Look, Nisha, your son looks just like Rohit.

1536
02:20:40,310 --> 02:20:47,180
Now go to your Mom. My son's
coming back to me.

1537
02:20:49,020 --> 02:20:53,420
Congratulations, chief! Your wife's
going to deliver a baby boy tomorrow!

1538
02:20:53,720 --> 02:20:56,500
But l'm going to distribute sweets
today! ln fact, right now?

1539
02:20:56,690 --> 02:20:57,620
What did you say?

1540
02:20:58,380 --> 02:20:59,720
What happened to my Rohit?

1541
02:21:00,150 --> 02:21:01,160
What happened, Mom?

1542
02:21:01,650 --> 02:21:04,480
No! That's impossible!

1543
02:21:05,290 --> 02:21:06,870
My Rohit can't be dead!

1544
02:21:08,190 --> 02:21:09,490
My Rohit is alive!

1545
02:21:09,730 --> 02:21:10,320
No!

1546
02:21:11,130 --> 02:21:11,790
No!

1547
02:21:12,860 --> 02:21:13,770
Which means, l...

1548
02:21:14,200 --> 02:21:18,720
Chief, the computer's malfunctioning!
Something's wrong with it!

1549
02:21:46,830 --> 02:21:47,860
Dr Arya!

1550
02:21:49,330 --> 02:21:54,330
lt's 6:40 there, it's 6:30 now!
This means, in just 10 minutes!

1551
02:21:54,520 --> 02:21:55,500
in this very room!

1552
02:22:01,210 --> 02:22:02,550
Look! Dr. Arya!

1553
02:22:03,950 --> 02:22:06,490
Have you heard of Shahjahan, Doctor Mathur?

1554
02:22:06,680 --> 02:22:08,580
Of course! He built the Taj Mahal.

1555
02:22:08,780 --> 02:22:10,480
lncomplete knowledge is always dangerous.

1556
02:22:10,780 --> 02:22:13,580
Shahjahan had the hands of workers
who built the Taj Mahal, chopped off!

1557
02:22:13,750 --> 02:22:16,070
so that there would never be another Taj Mahal.

1558
02:22:16,520 --> 02:22:19,980
Rohit Mehra is a workerfor me
and l'm his Shahjehan.

1559
02:22:20,920 --> 02:22:23,520
You mean, you're also going to
cut off Rohit's hands?

1560
02:22:23,690 --> 02:22:26,610
No...his brain!

1561
02:22:27,490 --> 02:22:33,120
because Rohit's brain will create problems,
for himself as well as for me.

1562
02:22:34,130 --> 02:22:37,520
Actually, l'm going to feel very sorry about
it because Rohit is a very good boy.

1563
02:22:37,690 --> 02:22:41,420
Sincere, honest, intelligent...

1564
02:22:41,590 --> 02:22:43,890
They're coming here, chief. Please leave!

1565
02:22:44,070 --> 02:22:46,610
No, no! l'm won't let this computer
go into the wrong hands.

1566
02:22:46,790 --> 02:22:48,060
l'll destroy everything!

1567
02:22:48,400 --> 02:22:48,960
All right!

1568
02:22:49,130 --> 02:22:51,070
l'll try and stop them!

1569
02:22:55,690 --> 02:22:56,350
Hello!

1570
02:22:56,530 --> 02:22:57,180
Mom?

1571
02:22:57,430 --> 02:23:00,370
Rohit? l've brought Nisha to the hospital.

1572
02:23:00,530 --> 02:23:03,600
Congratulations! You're going to
become a father anytime.

1573
02:23:03,770 --> 02:23:05,590
Come home soon, son

1574
02:23:05,760 --> 02:23:07,930
l'm coming, Mom! l'm coming!

1575
02:23:08,110 --> 02:23:13,380
Rohit...What's the matter? You sound tense?

1576
02:23:13,780 --> 02:23:17,970
l've been exploited, the world is very selfish!

1577
02:23:18,140 --> 02:23:21,770
Don't worry, l'll be back, l'll be back soon.

1578
02:24:25,430 --> 02:24:26,620
Rohit!

1579
02:24:28,070 --> 02:24:29,800
What have you done?

1580
02:24:32,910 --> 02:24:37,900
l've destroyed your dream...
l've destroyed everything!

1581
02:24:40,170 --> 02:24:42,300
because l've got to know of your intentions

1582
02:24:42,620 --> 02:24:49,380
But those who know me also
know that l never accept defeat.

1583
02:24:53,080 --> 02:24:54,980
l'll rebuild this computer

1584
02:24:55,980 --> 02:24:58,480
using your research.

1585
02:24:59,580 --> 02:25:02,590
But l don't need you anymore.

1586
02:25:05,580 --> 02:25:08,390
Thank you so much for everything, Rohit

1587
02:25:08,620 --> 02:25:09,490
Good bye

1588
02:25:10,720 --> 02:25:11,660
Hold it, sir!

1589
02:25:15,820 --> 02:25:18,090
Don't kill him, sir

1590
02:25:22,120 --> 02:25:27,460
lf you kill Rohit...then even if you
build the computer again

1591
02:25:27,790 --> 02:25:30,390
you'll never be able to start it

1592
02:25:32,630 --> 02:25:35,460
You need a password to start the computer

1593
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,560
and the password is Rohit himself.

1594
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:39,700
What?

1595
02:25:40,270 --> 02:25:41,030
Yes, sir

1596
02:25:41,870 --> 02:25:43,460
l've seen it with my own eyes.

1597
02:25:44,370 --> 02:25:49,840
Until scans of his retina and heartbeat
are fed into the computer...

1598
02:25:50,700 --> 02:25:52,470
the computer will not start.

1599
02:26:00,770 --> 02:26:02,710
This means, l'll have to keep you alive

1600
02:26:03,540 --> 02:26:07,130
till l don't build a new computer.

1601
02:26:10,840 --> 02:26:13,980
But die, you will.

1602
02:26:15,240 --> 02:26:16,460
Forthe world.

1603
02:26:21,150 --> 02:26:22,560
Breaking news.

1604
02:26:22,920 --> 02:26:24,680
Tragedy strikes!

1605
02:26:25,060 --> 02:26:28,110
Following a fire that broke out in
the lab of Technotronics...

1606
02:26:28,280 --> 02:26:33,060
The famous lndian genius Rohit Mehra
has met with a tragic death.

1607
02:26:33,850 --> 02:26:39,820
Let's observe a 2-minute silence,
so that Rohit Mehra's soul rests in peace.

1608
02:26:51,190 --> 02:26:55,520
Ever since, l had no choice but
to work for Dr Arya.

1609
02:26:57,190 --> 02:26:59,130
l couldn't even go to the police...

1610
02:27:01,530 --> 02:27:06,820
because if Dr Arya doubted me,
he would've killed me.

1611
02:27:08,300 --> 02:27:11,070
And l was the only man who could
get in touch with yourfamily.

1612
02:27:12,640 --> 02:27:16,620
That's exactly why l've been looking foryour
grandma and you for so many years.

1613
02:27:18,030 --> 02:27:20,770
And finally, l met you today, through Priya.

1614
02:27:56,190 --> 02:27:57,380
Dr Arya

1615
02:28:02,220 --> 02:28:03,390
20 years...

1616
02:28:06,520 --> 02:28:09,050
for 20 years, he's kept a
mother away from her son

1617
02:28:10,360 --> 02:28:12,590
and a son away from his father

1618
02:28:15,320 --> 02:28:17,720
lt's because of his lies that l lost my mother.

1619
02:28:27,160 --> 02:28:28,290
Where is my father?

1620
02:28:28,630 --> 02:28:30,000
Here in Singapore.

1621
02:28:30,730 --> 02:28:34,720
For 20 years Dr Arya has used
machines to keep him in a state

1622
02:28:34,940 --> 02:28:38,460
that only his brain is alive,
his body almost dead.

1623
02:28:42,340 --> 02:28:46,030
Good evening, my friend Rohit Mehra

1624
02:28:51,740 --> 02:28:53,750
How are you feeling today?

1625
02:28:56,340 --> 02:28:59,680
Are these machines taking good care of you?

1626
02:29:00,340 --> 02:29:01,250
Yes?

1627
02:29:03,910 --> 02:29:04,870
Good!

1628
02:29:06,010 --> 02:29:09,580
Tomorrow's the glorious and historic day

1629
02:29:09,750 --> 02:29:18,250
when my, sorry, our computer
will be inaugurated.

1630
02:29:19,020 --> 02:29:25,840
Yes! Ours, because nothing
was possible without you

1631
02:29:26,020 --> 02:29:30,920
For so many years, you have
shown such patience and understanding

1632
02:29:31,130 --> 02:29:33,330
and cooperated with me.

1633
02:29:34,030 --> 02:29:38,660
When the computer starts tomorrow

1634
02:29:41,290 --> 02:29:47,700
your utility will come to an end,
and so will your pain.

1635
02:29:52,730 --> 02:29:54,230
See you tomorrow

1636
02:30:04,040 --> 02:30:05,320
Breaking news!

1637
02:30:06,830 --> 02:30:09,840
Dr Arya has suddenly been
reminded of the poet Kabir.

1638
02:30:10,140 --> 02:30:11,700
Do today, what you must do tomorrow...

1639
02:30:11,870 --> 02:30:13,670
and do right now, what you must do today.

1640
02:30:13,840 --> 02:30:19,970
That's why, Dr Arya has decided
to start the computertoday itself.

1641
02:30:20,780 --> 02:30:24,080
and also end Rohit's life.

1642
02:30:25,240 --> 02:30:28,220
ls this where my father is kept?

1643
02:30:29,480 --> 02:30:34,880
Yes! But it's almost impossible
for a strangerto get there...

1644
02:30:35,420 --> 02:30:39,280
Dr. Arya has kept very tight security
everywhere on the island

1645
02:30:39,580 --> 02:30:43,050
So that now no one comes between
him and the computer

1646
02:30:43,260 --> 02:30:46,590
Krishna, if Dr. Arya starts the computer

1647
02:30:47,190 --> 02:30:58,620
how much havoc he can wreak and
the destruction he can cause, is unimaginable

1648
02:30:59,820 --> 02:31:09,070
mine... yours... ours, the worlds
destiny will come in his clutches.

1649
02:31:10,270 --> 02:31:13,100
That's why, Dr Arya has to be
stopped at any cost.

1650
02:31:14,200 --> 02:31:19,290
Now you have to save not only yourfather
but the whole mankind, Krishna.

1651
02:31:25,600 --> 02:31:26,210
Hello.

1652
02:31:26,560 --> 02:31:27,500
Krishna?

1653
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:29,900
Grandma!

1654
02:31:30,460 --> 02:31:33,510
Krishna, are you okay?

1655
02:31:35,740 --> 02:31:36,800
Yes, Grandma

1656
02:31:37,510 --> 02:31:41,500
l don't know why l'm feeling worried.

1657
02:31:42,140 --> 02:31:43,710
When are you coming back?

1658
02:31:44,310 --> 02:31:45,590
Come back soon

1659
02:31:47,140 --> 02:31:53,950
Yourfather's death anniversary is nearing,
you need to be here and fulfill the duties of a son.

1660
02:31:55,460 --> 02:32:00,120
l remember, Grandma. don't worry...

1661
02:32:02,490 --> 02:32:04,540
l'll fulfill all the duties of a son.

1662
02:32:35,690 --> 02:32:37,360
WELCOME TO THE FUTURE

1663
02:32:39,990 --> 02:32:41,300
Congratulations Sir!

1664
02:32:45,930 --> 02:32:50,070
See, Rohit l've won!

1665
02:32:52,470 --> 02:32:57,740
Now if you want you can end your life.

1666
02:33:01,570 --> 02:33:04,100
Or do you want me to help?

1667
02:33:08,610 --> 02:33:19,450
But what's the hurry? At least see how your
invention is going to make me God!

1668
02:34:12,300 --> 02:34:21,810
Rohit, we built this computer
so that we can see ourfuture

1669
02:34:21,980 --> 02:34:23,510
and change it!

1670
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:32,210
l will also change my future and show you
Today itself!

1671
02:34:41,080 --> 02:34:43,080
Dr Arya's gone to look forthe masked man

1672
02:34:45,020 --> 02:34:45,910
Masked man?

1673
02:35:07,990 --> 02:35:08,830
Kristian!

1674
02:35:15,300 --> 02:35:16,090
Krishna

1675
02:35:18,090 --> 02:35:19,460
Look Dr Arya!

1676
02:35:20,760 --> 02:35:21,630
Come on, let's go!

1677
02:35:37,170 --> 02:35:40,470
What had Kristian done? Why kill him?

1678
02:35:41,840 --> 02:35:46,530
Dr Arya has probably started the
computer and, he must've seen...

1679
02:35:46,700 --> 02:35:47,870
His future!

1680
02:35:49,470 --> 02:35:55,090
lt will be just as Dr Arya has seen.

1681
02:42:13,730 --> 02:42:17,020
l've changed my future!
l've changed my tomorrow!

1682
02:42:17,190 --> 02:42:19,170
There is no mask any longer...

1683
02:42:19,330 --> 02:42:25,600
Henceforth the new face of God is...
Dr Siddhant Arya!

1684
02:42:40,030 --> 02:42:42,340
How is this possible?

1685
02:42:43,610 --> 02:42:48,940
l've killed him with my own hands.
Then...who's this?

1686
02:42:50,210 --> 02:42:54,930
lts 9:15 there and it's 9 here.

1687
02:42:56,100 --> 02:42:58,610
This means, he'll be here in
the next 15 minutes.

1688
02:42:59,170 --> 02:43:02,180
that means he is already on the island!

1689
02:43:19,020 --> 02:43:19,720
Stop!

1690
02:43:23,950 --> 02:43:30,360
To capture him we need
planning not power.

1691
02:44:23,550 --> 02:44:27,570
Dr. Arya has kept very tight security
everywhere on the island.

1692
02:44:56,490 --> 02:45:02,430
You're good! Very good.
But l'm better

1693
02:45:09,900 --> 02:45:13,000
Yes, l am better

1694
02:45:14,490 --> 02:45:17,500
Because l have seen the future.

1695
02:45:23,140 --> 02:45:28,690
But due to lack of time what l
couldn't see is what l want to know...

1696
02:45:30,780 --> 02:45:32,650
Why do you want to kill me?

1697
02:45:34,970 --> 02:45:38,500
And why do you want to rescue Rohit Mehra?

1698
02:45:44,580 --> 02:45:45,840
Who are you?

1699
02:45:47,240 --> 02:45:51,410
Come to me and give me the answer.

1700
02:45:52,240 --> 02:45:53,050
come!

1701
02:46:05,510 --> 02:46:08,780
l've told you, l have seen the future

1702
02:46:09,280 --> 02:46:13,640
And l know who is with me...

1703
02:46:14,610 --> 02:46:15,520
Hello!

1704
02:46:16,180 --> 02:46:18,190
and who is against me

1705
02:46:19,430 --> 02:46:21,730
So...please cooperate

1706
02:47:24,260 --> 02:47:25,440
Who are you?

1707
02:47:28,240 --> 02:47:30,120
We'll get to know right now.

1708
02:49:35,430 --> 02:49:38,270
Who...are you?

1709
02:50:00,180 --> 02:50:02,920
Your son...Krishna!

1710
02:51:12,110 --> 02:51:12,880
Mom.

1711
02:52:49,810 --> 02:52:51,080
Thank you, Jadoo.

1712
02:52:53,160 --> 02:52:54,160
