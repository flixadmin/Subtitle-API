For the past five months,

2
00:00:01,661 --> 00:00:04,661
You've been waiting for things
to go back to the way things were.

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,658
A shark that does not swim, "drowns".

6
00:00:12,758 --> 00:00:14,158
If you don't move forward, you "die".

7
00:00:14,751 --> 00:00:16,151
I'm recruiting a new "team".

8
00:00:19,684 --> 00:00:21,924
The people that we're looking at
have some experiences on the street.

9
00:00:22,236 --> 00:00:23,396
You have the farthest
way to go.

10
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:24,480
I'm an "Olympian".

11
00:00:24,504 --> 00:00:28,604
It takes more than a few medals and
a mask to take on these streets.

12
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:33,450
They were "Bronze".

The "Green Arrow" cannot be stopped,

Unless we all work together.

What about "Oliver"?

19
00:00:52,946 --> 00:00:54,946
"Ollie" can take care of himself.

20
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,800
"Arrow"
