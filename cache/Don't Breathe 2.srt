1
00:03:22,328 --> 00:03:23,329
Yes.

2
00:03:30,753 --> 00:03:31,754
You failed.

3
00:03:31,838 --> 00:03:32,839
I didn't.

4
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:37,009
The gun is in my hand.

5
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:39,262
I thought I had it.

6
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:43,975
Sorry, Father. I'll make it next time.

7
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:46,185
Never take anything for granted.

8
00:03:47,395 --> 00:03:48,938
God will take it from you.

9
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,191
Is God bad?

10
00:03:55,778 --> 00:03:56,821
God is fair.

11
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:03,119
You almost got me, didn't you, boy?

12
00:04:23,848 --> 00:04:25,975
Did I get my white hair from you

13
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:27,226
or from Mom?

14
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:31,397
From your mother.

15
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:33,941
I can't believe
we don't have any pictures of her.

16
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:36,736
Everything was destroyed in the fire.

17
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:37,820
You know that.

18
00:04:38,488 --> 00:04:39,947
I could only save you.

19
00:04:44,452 --> 00:04:46,162
Was she beautiful?

20
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:52,752
She was smart.

21
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:56,506
Like you.

22
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,175
How many did I get?

23
00:04:59,258 --> 00:05:00,343
All of them.

24
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:05,807
So I get to go to town today, right?

25
00:05:08,935 --> 00:05:10,478
You failed survival.

26
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,315
It's been three months.

27
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:18,528
Plus, I just gave you a killer haircut.

28
00:05:19,195 --> 00:05:20,613
Trust me.

29
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:25,368
You need to pass all your tests first.

30
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:40,550
All right, apart from the usual,

31
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:43,261
I have an order of five ferns,

32
00:05:43,344 --> 00:05:44,554
two ficuses,

33
00:05:44,637 --> 00:05:47,098
and the Columnea grandiosa.

34
00:05:48,057 --> 00:05:49,057
Gloriosa.

35
00:05:49,475 --> 00:05:50,475
Gloriosa.

36
00:05:51,561 --> 00:05:53,396
Am I taking Phoenix today?

37
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:54,564
Not today.

38
00:05:54,647 --> 00:05:55,773
It's been a while.

39
00:05:56,482 --> 00:05:57,525
I said, no.

40
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:03,948
You either loosen up that leash,

41
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,367
or sooner or later, she'll bite it off.

42
00:06:20,715 --> 00:06:22,008
Go with Hernandez.

43
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:28,222
Back by sunset!

44
00:06:28,306 --> 00:06:29,306
I will.

45
00:06:33,811 --> 00:06:35,354
Hey, Hernandez.

46
00:06:35,438 --> 00:06:36,564
Hey, gorgeous.

I think my mom sang it to me
when I was little.

55

That first part's all I remember.

You wanna pay her a visit?

Yes.

105
00:11:20,806 --> 00:11:22,391

106
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:23,475
Yeah.

107
00:11:24,435 --> 00:11:26,604
No shortage of those around here.

108
00:11:41,035 --> 00:11:42,035
Follow them.

109
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:53,881
Thanks, Hernandez.

110
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:57,259
We had a lot of fun today.

111
00:11:57,343 --> 00:11:59,553
I'll take her again next week
if you're okay with that.

112
00:11:59,637 --> 00:12:00,637
No.

113
00:12:01,013 --> 00:12:02,097
Today is enough.

114
00:12:08,354 --> 00:12:10,074
Even I know it's none of my business, but I...

115
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:11,147
You're right.

116
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,399
It's not.

117

You're a bad man.

118
00:12:21,116 --> 00:12:23,077
A man who's done terrible things.

119
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:30,042
At least, I know you think that.

120
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:33,003

129
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:15,814
Yeah.

130
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:17,566
We all did too.

131
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:21,070
- Iraq?
- Yeah.

132
00:14:21,153 --> 00:14:24,782
Dishonorably discharged
from a dishonorable war.

133
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:30,913
I'd say that makes us honorable somehow.
Wouldn't you?

134
00:14:31,789 --> 00:14:32,789
No.

135
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,586
Can you move your truck off the road now?

136
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:42,633
Sure, baby.

137
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:44,802
Whatever you want.

138
00:15:58,292 --> 00:16:00,586
Lessons next month.

139
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:02,795
Okay.

140
00:16:03,297 --> 00:16:05,841
- I wanna go to school next year.
- Huh.

141
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:10,512
- This is school...
- A real school, with other kids like me.

142
00:16:10,596 --> 00:16:12,181
Homeschool is safer.

143
00:16:12,264 --> 00:16:14,141
I don't wanna be safe.

144
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:17,019
I wanna be normal. I wanna have friends.

145
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:18,770
- I wanna live a...
- Enough!

146
00:16:19,563 --> 00:16:20,563
Enough.

147
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:25,319
I already lost a daughter once.

148
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:27,070
I'm not losing you.

149
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:28,864
But I'm lonely.

150
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:33,285
You have no idea what it is to be alone.

151
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:36,121
You have me.

152
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:41,793

Shadow.

162
00:27:31,985 --> 00:27:32,985

163
00:27:34,612 --> 00:27:35,655
Open up!

164
00:30:02,176 --> 00:30:03,886
What the fuck?

165
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:05,513

166
00:30:08,766 --> 00:30:09,892

Breathe, brother.

170
00:30:51,809 --> 00:30:53,478
The guy's a Navy SEAL.

171
00:31:08,785 --> 00:31:10,661

172

00:32:25,528 --> 00:32:27,280
He's down there with you!

174
00:32:28,072 --> 00:32:30,158
Blind fuck is down there!

175
00:32:48,301 --> 00:32:49,343
Call Raylan.

176
00:33:25,213 --> 00:33:27,590
Metal box is almost full of water.

177
00:33:31,177 --> 00:33:32,970
You prefer to see the kid alive...

178
00:33:35,515 --> 00:33:37,058
you come in here.

179
00:33:40,061 --> 00:33:41,395
You think I'm fucking with you?

180
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:47,150
No.

181
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:51,989
There's a live wire
about to reach the water.

182
00:33:52,073 --> 00:33:53,574
Come out, or she's fried!

183
00:34:09,549 --> 00:34:11,008
Clever fuck.

184
00:34:11,968 --> 00:34:13,219
No guns, huh?

185
00:34:14,637 --> 00:34:15,638
No problem.

186
00:36:51,168 --> 00:36:52,336
You're tough.

187
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,673
But you're done.

188
00:37:07,935 --> 00:37:10,104
What the fuck?

189
00:37:10,187 --> 00:37:11,188
Yo, bro.

190
00:38:28,682 --> 00:38:31,018
Breathe.

191
00:38:31,101 --> 00:38:33,103
Come on, breathe.

192
00:38:34,563 --> 00:38:35,564
Breathe.

193
00:38:36,148 --> 00:38:37,148
Breathe.

194
00:38:43,948 --> 00:38:45,783
The old blind man did this?

195
00:38:45,866 --> 00:38:46,992
Uh-huh.

196
00:38:50,246 --> 00:38:51,413
Let's go.

197
00:39:08,013 --> 00:39:09,181
I can walk.

198
00:39:09,765 --> 00:39:11,225
I said, I can walk.

199
00:39:14,436 --> 00:39:15,437
What's happening?

200
00:39:27,533 --> 00:39:28,701
Cover the exits.

201
00:39:41,088 --> 00:39:42,548
What the fuck?

202
00:40:10,618 --> 00:40:12,286
They're still down here.

203
00:40:42,691 --> 00:40:43,984
What's happening?

204
00:40:45,444 --> 00:40:47,154
- Who are they?
- I don't know.

205
00:41:32,032 --> 00:41:34,451
You don't need to be afraid,
little girl.

206
00:41:36,704 --> 00:41:39,748
This has all just been
one big misunderstanding.

207
00:41:51,385 --> 00:41:53,554
It's not me you need to be scared of...

208
00:42:00,102 --> 00:42:02,062
but the man standing next to you.

209
00:42:05,232 --> 00:42:06,984
Now, I don't know who he is.

210
00:42:10,779 --> 00:42:12,197
But I know who he's not.

211
00:42:21,582 --> 00:42:22,666
Should I tell her or you?

212
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:31,175
Finish him, bro.

213
00:42:32,051 --> 00:42:33,052
No!

214
00:42:33,802 --> 00:42:36,305
- Dad! Dad, wake up.
- Aren't you something?

215
00:42:38,432 --> 00:42:39,641
Let me go!

216
00:42:41,685 --> 00:42:42,811
Come on.

217
00:42:43,812 --> 00:42:44,813
No, it's okay.

218
00:42:48,817 --> 00:42:50,194
Yeah, there you go.

219
00:42:50,819 --> 00:42:51,819
There you go.

220
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,074
You don't remember me, do you?

221
00:42:56,867 --> 00:42:58,619
Maybe this will help.

222
00:43:09,254 --> 00:43:10,254
See?

223
00:43:15,302 --> 00:43:16,302
What...?

224
00:43:19,389 --> 00:43:21,600
Years ago, there was a fire in our house.

225
00:43:22,392 --> 00:43:23,769
Cops blamed me.

226
00:43:24,603 --> 00:43:27,523
I spent eight years in prison,
wondering if I'd ever see you again.

227
00:43:32,111 --> 00:43:34,363
I didn't even know
if you were dead or alive.

228
00:43:39,284 --> 00:43:40,994
<i>This creep here must have...</i>

229
00:43:41,954 --> 00:43:44,039
<i>found you and kept you for himself.</i>

230
00:43:45,707 --> 00:43:47,209
<i>Up next in local news,</i>

231
00:43:47,292 --> 00:43:50,754
<i>a meth lab caught fire
in west Detroit this morning.</i>

232
00:43:50,838 --> 00:43:53,549
<i>Police were able
to arrest the primary suspect.</i>

233
00:43:53,632 --> 00:43:56,552
<i>The man was taken into custody
and could face charges</i>

234
00:43:56,635 --> 00:43:59,721
<i>for a large number of crimes committed
over the past several years.</i>

235
00:43:59,805 --> 00:44:03,016
<i>You have no idea how much
I've been waiting for this moment.</i>

236
00:44:19,116 --> 00:44:20,367
Did he hurt you?

237
00:44:22,369 --> 00:44:25,998
But he did steal you away from me,
and now he must die, you understand?

238
00:44:28,709 --> 00:44:29,710
Kill him.

239
00:44:30,419 --> 00:44:31,670
- No.
- Fuck are you doing?

240
00:44:32,629 --> 00:44:35,132
Not in front of my kid. Do it outside.

241
00:44:40,804 --> 00:44:43,515
Wake up, you blind fuck.

242
00:44:46,852 --> 00:44:47,810
Fuck!

243
00:45:10,042 --> 00:45:11,376
Fucking coward.

244
00:45:18,467 --> 00:45:21,845
Take her to the truck
while I hunt this motherfucker. Let's go.

245
00:45:28,352 --> 00:45:29,978
- Let me go!
- What's wrong with you?

246
00:45:31,104 --> 00:45:32,439
Fucking wanna go home?

247
00:45:58,757 --> 00:46:00,300
I don't care who you are.

248
00:46:00,384 --> 00:46:02,469
I'm gonna teach you some fucking manners.

249
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:04,972
You ungrateful little bitch.

250
00:46:23,991 --> 00:46:24,992
No.

251
00:46:33,375 --> 00:46:34,375
Stop.

252
00:46:35,294 --> 00:46:36,294
Please!

253
00:46:37,212 --> 00:46:38,463
Stop!

254
00:46:54,062 --> 00:46:55,647
Move. Go, go.

255
00:46:55,731 --> 00:46:57,441
Move. Now.

256
00:47:25,594 --> 00:47:26,845
Move!

257
00:47:39,608 --> 00:47:40,650
I'm sorry, man.

258
00:47:44,321 --> 00:47:47,824
- He's back in the house.
- I know. He wants us to follow him.

259
00:47:50,327 --> 00:47:52,079
Enough of these silly games.

260
00:48:09,763 --> 00:48:11,098
It's his jacket.

261
00:48:13,350 --> 00:48:14,266
Attaboy.

262
00:48:14,267 --> 00:48:15,645
Attaboy.

263
00:48:17,604 --> 00:48:18,647
Wait.

264
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:19,731
Stop.

265
00:48:22,234 --> 00:48:23,568
Is it true?

266
00:48:23,652 --> 00:48:24,778
Move.

267
00:48:24,861 --> 00:48:26,363
What's my real name?

268
00:48:26,446 --> 00:48:27,697
Get over here now!

269
00:48:27,781 --> 00:48:29,157
When's my birthday?

270
00:48:29,241 --> 00:48:31,159
- My real one?
- Stop it!

271
00:48:31,243 --> 00:48:32,577
No, you stop it!

272
00:48:42,212 --> 00:48:43,296
Go!

273
00:49:52,282 --> 00:49:53,282
Hey.

274
00:51:13,405 --> 00:51:14,614
Phoenix!

275
00:51:15,907 --> 00:51:17,576
Calm down, girl.

276
00:51:20,370 --> 00:51:21,370
Calm down.

277
00:51:41,933 --> 00:51:42,933
Stay.

278
00:51:58,575 --> 00:51:59,826
Put her in the truck.

279
00:52:23,642 --> 00:52:25,143
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

280
00:52:27,312 --> 00:52:28,438
What are you doing?

281
00:52:29,356 --> 00:52:31,900
- Your dog's in there.
- Dog's dead.

282
00:52:31,983 --> 00:52:33,568
You don't know that.

283
00:52:33,652 --> 00:52:35,195
You wanna go and find out?

284
00:53:32,544 --> 00:53:33,670
No!

285
00:56:28,970 --> 00:56:30,346
Good morning, princess.

286
00:56:39,147 --> 00:56:40,148
How you feeling?

287
00:56:45,528 --> 00:56:46,528
You all right?

288
00:56:48,656 --> 00:56:49,782
Wanna sit with me?

289
00:56:51,826 --> 00:56:53,453
Come, sit with me. Come on.

290
00:56:55,038 --> 00:56:56,080
Yeah.

291
00:56:57,165 --> 00:56:58,165
There you go.

292
00:56:58,708 --> 00:56:59,708
There you go.

293
00:57:00,919 --> 00:57:01,919
Yeah.

294
00:57:08,593 --> 00:57:09,594
Door's open.

295
00:57:11,304 --> 00:57:12,931
Not a prisoner anymore.

296
00:57:14,599 --> 00:57:17,310
You mean, I can go?

297
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:20,021
If you want.

298
00:57:22,357 --> 00:57:25,693
Or you can stay here
and find out who you really are.

299
00:57:34,494 --> 00:57:36,537
Do I have any brothers or sisters?

300
00:57:39,207 --> 00:57:40,625
Unfortunately, no.

301
00:57:43,461 --> 00:57:44,879
When's my birthday?

302
00:57:45,463 --> 00:57:46,589
February 20th.

303
00:57:49,217 --> 00:57:50,843
What was my mother's name?

304
00:57:53,221 --> 00:57:54,222
Josephine.

305
00:57:55,848 --> 00:57:57,058
Do I look like her?

306
00:58:00,895 --> 00:58:01,980
Yeah.

307
00:58:04,691 --> 00:58:05,691
You do.

308
00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:09,319
Tara.

309
00:58:10,697 --> 00:58:11,864
That's your real name.

310
00:58:13,950 --> 00:58:14,950
Tara.

311
00:58:16,911 --> 00:58:18,955
Everything that man told you is a lie.

312
00:58:20,248 --> 00:58:21,499
What happened to him?

313
00:58:23,167 --> 00:58:24,585
He got what he deserved.

314
00:58:26,754 --> 00:58:29,173
Hey. I'm not sorry.

315
00:58:29,841 --> 00:58:31,300
You shouldn't be either.

316
00:58:31,884 --> 00:58:32,885
I wanna go.

317
00:58:34,470 --> 00:58:36,305
Where? Where you gonna go?

318
00:58:36,389 --> 00:58:38,099
There's a shelter I know.

319
00:58:39,976 --> 00:58:43,521
Like I said,
you're not a prisoner anymore.

344
01:02:23,115 --> 01:02:25,159
Mm.

345
01:02:25,243 --> 01:02:26,577
There you are.

346
01:02:26,661 --> 01:02:31,624
You were such a beautiful baby.

347
01:02:42,218 --> 01:02:43,218
Get it out.

348
01:02:43,719 --> 01:02:44,971
Get it out. Come on.

349
01:02:45,554 --> 01:02:48,057
There you go. There you go.

350
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:49,392
- There you go.
- Sorry.

351
01:02:49,475 --> 01:02:51,686
Nothing to apologize for.

352
01:02:53,229 --> 01:02:54,563
Are you okay?

353
01:02:58,067 --> 01:03:01,237
The same fire that destroyed our family...

354
01:03:03,406 --> 01:03:06,033
it burned up my insides.

355
01:03:10,830 --> 01:03:13,499
Mom and Dad used to have a...

356
01:03:17,003 --> 01:03:18,003
kitchen...

357
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:21,757
in the basement of our house,

358
01:03:21,841 --> 01:03:24,552
where we used to cook.

359
01:03:28,681 --> 01:03:30,766
It was for our business.

360
01:03:35,187 --> 01:03:36,314
Are you thirsty?

361
01:03:51,329 --> 01:03:52,329
Tara?

362
01:03:54,415 --> 01:03:55,833
I'm dying.

363
01:03:55,916 --> 01:03:56,916
What?

364
01:03:58,544 --> 01:04:00,671
The smoke from the chemicals...

365
01:04:01,922 --> 01:04:05,593
poisoned my blood
and badly damaged my heart.

366
01:04:05,676 --> 01:04:08,554
I don't think I have much time left.

367
01:04:08,637 --> 01:04:10,514
Is there anything you can do?

368
01:04:20,066 --> 01:04:23,361
I heard you left flowers for me
at our old house.

369
01:04:27,073 --> 01:04:28,366
Is that true?

370
01:04:31,827 --> 01:04:32,828
Oh...

371
01:04:34,580 --> 01:04:40,211
Weren't you wishing
your mama was healthy and alive?

372
01:04:40,878 --> 01:04:41,878
Yes.

373
01:04:55,684 --> 01:04:57,436
I need a new heart, baby.

374
01:04:58,646 --> 01:05:00,314
But not just any heart.

375
01:05:00,981 --> 01:05:03,818
Doctor said it has to be a, um...

376
01:05:04,527 --> 01:05:06,570
It must be a...

377
01:05:08,030 --> 01:05:09,782
compatible donor.

378
01:05:13,953 --> 01:05:15,996
Like a direct relative.

379
01:05:18,707 --> 01:05:21,627
You hold the gift
that can save your mama's life.

380
01:05:25,881 --> 01:05:28,217
And, baby, I need that gift.

381
01:05:47,736 --> 01:05:50,531
We'll finally be together as one.

382
01:05:52,741 --> 01:05:57,413
You'll live on in me.

383
01:06:26,692 --> 01:06:27,608
Go home.

384
01:06:29,111 --> 01:06:31,322
Shh.

385
01:06:31,405 --> 01:06:33,032
Shh!

386
01:08:20,973 --> 01:08:21,973
Go away.

387
01:08:23,892 --> 01:08:25,102
I said, go home.

388
01:08:33,402 --> 01:08:34,402
Stay.

389
01:08:37,740 --> 01:08:38,740
Stay.

390
01:09:10,939 --> 01:09:11,939
Go home.

391
01:09:21,075 --> 01:09:22,159
Go home.

392
01:10:03,742 --> 01:10:06,954
I hope you understand
the high risks of this procedure.

393
01:10:08,664 --> 01:10:10,249
I think I pay you enough.

394
01:10:10,332 --> 01:10:11,917
Shut up and do your job.

395
01:10:13,711 --> 01:10:15,212
Why is she still alive?

396
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,966
If she's dead, so is her heart.

397
01:10:20,676 --> 01:10:24,346
I can't keep it fresh long enough
without the proper equipment.

398
01:10:25,931 --> 01:10:28,600
I have to cut it out of her
while she's still breathing.

399
01:10:30,978 --> 01:10:31,978
Hey.

400
01:10:32,771 --> 01:10:34,314
Hey, hey, hey.

401
01:10:34,398 --> 01:10:36,024
Hey, hey.

402
01:10:39,445 --> 01:10:40,446
<i>Thank you.</i>

403
01:11:01,341 --> 01:11:02,676
What's wrong with you?

404
01:11:04,636 --> 01:11:06,847
What they're doing in there is wrong.

405
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:09,808
She's our cook.

406
01:11:11,518 --> 01:11:13,854
If she dies, there's no product.

407
01:11:14,646 --> 01:11:17,024
If there's no product, there's no us.

408
01:11:19,485 --> 01:11:20,694
<i>Comprende?</i>

409
01:11:22,946 --> 01:11:24,615
Still fucking wrong.

410
01:11:32,831 --> 01:11:33,831
Hey.

411
01:11:35,375 --> 01:11:37,211
- You ready?
- Mm.

412
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:41,380
Let's go.

413
01:12:05,614 --> 01:12:06,865
What the fuck?

414
01:12:12,704 --> 01:12:13,914
Go check it out.

415
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:33,619
You killed my brother!

416
01:13:35,037 --> 01:13:37,039
You blind freak!

417
01:13:59,353 --> 01:14:02,940
I'm gonna carve your fucking head open
like a pumpkin, man.

418
01:14:59,496 --> 01:15:01,164
This is for Shadow.

419
01:15:03,250 --> 01:15:04,250
Oh, fuck.

420
01:15:04,793 --> 01:15:06,086
No!

421
01:15:12,884 --> 01:15:13,885
It's him.

422
01:15:19,349 --> 01:15:22,227
How the hell did he find...?

423
01:15:40,579 --> 01:15:42,497
Disloyal fucking animal.

424
01:15:42,581 --> 01:15:44,041
Is everything okay?

425
01:15:46,209 --> 01:15:48,045
Yeah, everything's okay.

426
01:15:48,587 --> 01:15:50,297
- Everything's okay, I promise.
- Baby...

427
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:51,649
- Mm-hm?
- ...should I be worried?

428
01:15:51,673 --> 01:15:53,341
No, no. Not at all.

429
01:15:53,425 --> 01:15:54,843
I got you. I got you.

430
01:15:54,926 --> 01:15:56,720
I can't work without power.

431
01:15:57,679 --> 01:15:58,679
Uh...

432
01:15:59,639 --> 01:16:00,974
Change of plans, then.

433
01:16:02,350 --> 01:16:04,227
Pack your things. Bring the girl.

434
01:16:04,311 --> 01:16:05,311
Raul.

435
01:16:07,355 --> 01:16:09,649
- Bring the men. Kill the blind man.
- How many of us?

436
01:16:10,233 --> 01:16:11,526
All of you!

437
01:16:15,489 --> 01:16:16,489
Let's go.

438
01:17:49,749 --> 01:17:50,792
They're gonna kill her.

439
01:17:56,047 --> 01:17:57,716
And that's not cool with me.

440
01:18:01,469 --> 01:18:02,762
They're leaving now.

441
01:18:02,846 --> 01:18:06,892
The ladder behind you leads
directly to them. You'd better hurry.

442
01:18:21,406 --> 01:18:22,406
Go left.

443
01:18:24,117 --> 01:18:25,117
That way.

444
01:18:28,663 --> 01:18:29,998
He'll kill you all.

445
01:18:39,925 --> 01:18:40,967
Fuck it. I'm out.

446
01:18:41,051 --> 01:18:42,093
Hey, hey!

447
01:18:42,177 --> 01:18:43,177
Hey!

448
01:19:08,495 --> 01:19:10,205
Good morning, motherfucker.

449
01:19:14,834 --> 01:19:16,586
- Baby.
- Shh, shh, shh.

450
01:19:16,670 --> 01:19:17,670
It's okay.

451
01:19:17,712 --> 01:19:18,755
Stop it.

452
01:19:52,622 --> 01:19:53,622
Baby?

453
01:19:55,417 --> 01:19:56,501
Hello?

454
01:19:56,584 --> 01:19:58,295
I can't see you.

455
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:09,222
Baby?

456
01:20:41,588 --> 01:20:43,340
Someone's here! Hurry!

457
01:20:44,924 --> 01:20:45,925
Baby?

458
01:21:10,033 --> 01:21:11,534
I got you, motherfucker.

459
01:21:23,421 --> 01:21:24,421
No.

460
01:21:24,839 --> 01:21:25,965
No!

461
01:21:26,049 --> 01:21:27,467
No!

462
01:21:36,267 --> 01:21:37,267
No.

463
01:21:39,687 --> 01:21:40,688
No!

464
01:22:32,907 --> 01:22:35,660
Phoenix!

465
01:23:07,484 --> 01:23:08,484
Now...

466
01:23:09,444 --> 01:23:11,321
you're gonna see

467
01:23:11,404 --> 01:23:12,822
what I see.

468
01:24:03,414 --> 01:24:04,415
Phoenix?

469
01:24:15,468 --> 01:24:16,468
Stop.

470
01:24:17,637 --> 01:24:18,637
Stop!

471
01:24:21,975 --> 01:24:22,975
You...

472
01:24:25,687 --> 01:24:27,522
You mustn't come near me.

473
01:24:33,987 --> 01:24:37,657
Everything he said...

474
01:24:40,868 --> 01:24:41,953
is true.

475
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:51,087
I am no father.

476
01:24:56,050 --> 01:24:57,969
I have killed.

477
01:25:03,975 --> 01:25:04,975
I...

478
01:25:06,102 --> 01:25:07,520
have raped.

479
01:25:08,813 --> 01:25:09,813
I...

480
01:25:13,401 --> 01:25:14,611
am nothing.

481
01:25:20,617 --> 01:25:21,617
Nothing...

482
01:25:23,911 --> 01:25:25,204
but a monster.

483
01:25:31,753 --> 01:25:32,753
And you...

484
01:25:33,546 --> 01:25:35,340
cannot be around me.

485
01:25:37,467 --> 01:25:38,467
Ever.

486
01:25:40,762 --> 01:25:41,762
So go.

487
01:25:45,266 --> 01:25:46,726
Now. Go.

488
01:25:48,019 --> 01:25:49,270
Go!

489
01:26:21,177 --> 01:26:23,096
Oh, God.

490
01:27:13,062 --> 01:27:14,647
Tara?

491
01:27:38,254 --> 01:27:39,255
No.

492
01:27:41,716 --> 01:27:42,716
No.

493
01:27:43,259 --> 01:27:44,259
No.

494
01:27:48,890 --> 01:27:49,890
Please.

495
01:27:55,021 --> 01:27:56,856
No, no, no.

496
01:27:58,483 --> 01:27:59,525
Let me help you.

497
01:28:01,694 --> 01:28:02,904
I can save you.

498
01:28:09,035 --> 01:28:10,745
You already have.

499
01:29:56,100 --> 01:29:57,100
Hey.

500
01:29:59,228 --> 01:30:00,228
Hey.

501
01:30:01,647 --> 01:30:03,566
Think there's room for one more?

502
01:30:05,109 --> 01:30:06,193
I'm sure there is.

503
01:30:08,237 --> 01:30:09,238
What's your name?

504
01:30:13,993 --> 01:30:15,620
My name is Phoenix.
