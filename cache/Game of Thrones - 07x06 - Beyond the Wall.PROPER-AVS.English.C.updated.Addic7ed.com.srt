2
00:02:32,047 --> 00:02:34,379
- You all right?
- Mm.

3
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,588
Ever been north before?

4
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:38,254
Never seen snow before.

5
00:02:38,255 --> 00:02:40,129
Beautiful, eh?

6
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:41,671
I can breathe again.

7
00:02:41,672 --> 00:02:43,838
Down south, the air
smells like pig shit.

8
00:02:43,839 --> 00:02:45,463
You've never been down south.

9
00:02:45,464 --> 00:02:47,379
- I've been to Winterfell.
- That's the North.

10
00:02:48,797 --> 00:02:50,921
How do you live up here?

11
00:02:50,922 --> 00:02:52,796
How do you keep your
balls from freezing off?

12
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:55,296
You got to keep moving.
That's the secret.

13
00:02:55,297 --> 00:02:59,338
Walking's good, fighting's
better, fucking's best.

14
00:02:59,339 --> 00:03:02,796
There's not a living woman
within a hundred miles of here.

15
00:03:02,797 --> 00:03:05,172
We have to make do with what we've got.

16
00:03:10,797 --> 00:03:13,379
This one is maybe not so smart.

17
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,296
Davos says he's a strong fighter.

18
00:03:15,297 --> 00:03:18,796
Good. That's more important
than being smart.

19
00:03:18,797 --> 00:03:22,005
Smart people don't come up
here looking for the dead.

20
00:03:23,547 --> 00:03:26,838
So, you met this Dragon Queen, huh?

21
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:28,212
And?

22
00:03:28,213 --> 00:03:31,588
She'll only fight beside
us if I bend the knee.

23
00:03:31,589 --> 00:03:34,004
You spent too much time
with the Free Folk.

24
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,714
Now you don't like kneeling.

25
00:03:38,672 --> 00:03:41,004
Mance Rayder was a brave man.

26
00:03:41,005 --> 00:03:42,838
A proud man.

27
00:03:42,839 --> 00:03:46,672
The King-beyond-the-Wall
never bent the knee.

28
00:03:48,005 --> 00:03:51,672
How many of his people
died for his pride?

29
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:07,004
You still mad at us, boy?

30
00:04:07,005 --> 00:04:09,046
You sold me to a witch.

31
00:04:09,047 --> 00:04:10,463
A priestess.

32
00:04:10,464 --> 00:04:13,379
I'll admit, it is a subtle distinction.

33
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:16,546
We're fighting a great war.
Wars cost money.

34
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:18,421
I wanted to be one of you.

35
00:04:18,422 --> 00:04:21,463
I wanted to join the
Brotherhood, but you sold me off

36
00:04:21,464 --> 00:04:23,421
like a slave.

37
00:04:23,422 --> 00:04:25,421
Do you know what she did to me?

38
00:04:25,422 --> 00:04:27,004
She strapped me down on a bed,

39
00:04:27,005 --> 00:04:29,838
- she stripped me naked...
- Sounds all right so far.

40
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:32,588
- and put leeches on me.
- Was she naked, too?

41
00:04:32,589 --> 00:04:34,046
She needed your blood.

42
00:04:34,047 --> 00:04:35,713
Yes, thank you. I know that.

43
00:04:35,714 --> 00:04:38,671
- Could have been worse.
- She wanted to kill me!

44
00:04:38,672 --> 00:04:40,707
They would have killed
me if wasn't for Davos.

45
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:42,672
But they didn't, did they?

46
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:44,588
So, what you whinging about?

47
00:04:44,589 --> 00:04:46,254
I'm not whinging.

48
00:04:46,255 --> 00:04:49,212
Your lips are moving and you're
complaining about something.

49
00:04:49,213 --> 00:04:51,254
That's whinging.

50
00:04:51,255 --> 00:04:53,046
This one's been killed six times.

51
00:04:53,047 --> 00:04:54,756
You don't hear him bitching about it.

52
00:05:04,963 --> 00:05:06,380
Good lad.

53
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:14,588
The first time I went north of
the Wall was with your father.

54
00:05:14,589 --> 00:05:16,212
He was a good man.

55
00:05:16,213 --> 00:05:19,338
He deserved a better son.

56
00:05:19,339 --> 00:05:21,379
Were you with him at the end?

57
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:24,463
I was a prisoner of the wildlings.

58
00:05:24,464 --> 00:05:26,463
But we avenged him.

59
00:05:26,464 --> 00:05:27,962
I want you to know that.

60
00:05:27,963 --> 00:05:30,962
Every mutineer found justice.

61
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:33,796
Can't think of a worse
way for him to go.

62
00:05:33,797 --> 00:05:35,296
The Night's Watch was his life.

63
00:05:35,297 --> 00:05:38,129
He would have died to protect
every one of those men.

64
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,588
And they butchered him.

65
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,796
I hate that he died that way.

66
00:05:42,797 --> 00:05:45,463
My father was the most
honorable man I ever met.

67
00:05:45,464 --> 00:05:48,254
He was good all the way through.

68
00:05:48,255 --> 00:05:51,504
And he died on the executioner's block.

69
00:05:51,505 --> 00:05:55,671
Your father wanted to
execute me, you know?

70
00:05:55,672 --> 00:05:57,212
I heard.

71
00:05:57,213 --> 00:05:59,504
He was in the right, of course.

72
00:05:59,505 --> 00:06:02,004
Didn't make me hate him any less.

73
00:06:02,005 --> 00:06:05,005
- I'm glad he didn't catch you.
- Me, too.

74
00:06:13,505 --> 00:06:15,254
Your father gave me this sword.

75
00:06:15,255 --> 00:06:18,797
Changed the pommel from
a bear to a wolf...

76
00:06:22,464 --> 00:06:24,047
but it's still Longclaw.

77
00:06:30,464 --> 00:06:32,338
Lord Commander Mormont

78
00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:34,963
thought you'd never
come back to Westeros.

79
00:06:36,464 --> 00:06:38,838
But you are back,

80
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:42,796
and it's been in your
family for centuries.

81
00:06:42,797 --> 00:06:44,589
It's not right for me to have it.

82
00:06:48,213 --> 00:06:50,171
He gave it to you.

83
00:06:50,172 --> 00:06:52,380
I'm not his son.

84
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,547
I brought shame onto my house.

85
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,255
I broke my father's heart.

86
00:07:07,047 --> 00:07:09,547
I forfeited the right
to claim this sword.

87
00:07:11,714 --> 00:07:13,379
It's yours.

88
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,505
May it serve you well...

89
00:07:16,881 --> 00:07:18,547
and your children after you.

90
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:47,254
Father used to watch us from up here.

91
00:07:47,255 --> 00:07:49,755
He wouldn't say much.

92
00:07:49,756 --> 00:07:51,129
You probably don't remember.

93
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:53,130
You were inside knitting all the time.

94
00:07:54,464 --> 00:07:55,881
I remember.

95
00:07:58,005 --> 00:08:00,963
One time, the boys were shooting
arrows with Ser Rodrik.

96
00:08:02,297 --> 00:08:04,588
I came out here after,

97
00:08:04,589 --> 00:08:06,838
and Bran had left his bow behind,

98
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:09,463
just lying on the ground.

99
00:08:09,464 --> 00:08:11,839
Ser Rodrik would have
cuffed him if he saw.

100
00:08:14,339 --> 00:08:17,421
There was one arrow in the target.

101
00:08:17,422 --> 00:08:21,087
There was no one around, just like now.

102
00:08:21,088 --> 00:08:22,963
No one to stop me.

103
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:26,588
So I started shooting.

104
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,962
And every shot, I had to go up there

105
00:08:28,963 --> 00:08:32,255
and get my one arrow and walk
back and shoot it again.

106
00:08:33,756 --> 00:08:35,505
I wasn't very good.

107
00:08:37,047 --> 00:08:40,046
Finally, I hit the bull's-eye.

108
00:08:40,047 --> 00:08:42,463
Could have been the
20th shot or the 50th.

109
00:08:42,464 --> 00:08:43,921
I don't remember.

110
00:08:43,922 --> 00:08:47,339
But I hit the bull's-eye,
and I heard this.

111
00:08:49,756 --> 00:08:51,254
I looked up,

112
00:08:51,255 --> 00:08:53,004
and he's standing right here,

113
00:08:53,005 --> 00:08:54,672
smiling down at me.

114
00:08:57,172 --> 00:09:00,254
I knew what I was doing
was against the rules.

115
00:09:00,255 --> 00:09:04,671
But he was smiling, so I
knew it wasn't wrong.

116
00:09:04,672 --> 00:09:06,213
The rules were wrong.

117
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,881
I was doing what I was meant
to be doing, and he knew it.

118
00:09:13,756 --> 00:09:15,505
Now he's dead.

119
00:09:17,005 --> 00:09:19,254
Killed by the Lannisters

120
00:09:19,255 --> 00:09:20,881
with your help.

121
00:09:24,547 --> 00:09:25,947
What?

122
00:09:35,547 --> 00:09:37,755
That's your pretty handwriting.

123
00:09:37,756 --> 00:09:39,588
Septa Mordane used to crack my knuckles

124
00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:41,339
'cause I couldn't write as well as you.

125
00:09:43,422 --> 00:09:47,379
"Robb, I write to you
today with heavy heart.

126
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,546
Our good King Robert is dead,

127
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:51,379
killed from wounds he
took in a boar hunt."

128
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,880
You don't have to read it. I remember.

129
00:09:52,881 --> 00:09:54,588
"Father has been charged with treason.

130
00:09:54,589 --> 00:09:57,546
He conspired with Robert's brothers
against my beloved Joffrey

131
00:09:57,547 --> 00:09:59,379
and tried to steal his throne.

132
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,212
The Lannisters are treating me well

133
00:10:01,213 --> 00:10:03,212
and providing me with every comfort.

134
00:10:03,213 --> 00:10:05,546
I beg you, come to King's Landing,

135
00:10:05,547 --> 00:10:07,421
swear fealty to King Joffrey,

136
00:10:07,422 --> 00:10:09,630
and prevent any strife
between the great houses

137
00:10:09,631 --> 00:10:11,421
of Lannister and Stark.

138
00:10:11,422 --> 00:10:13,630
Your faithful sister, Sansa."

139
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:16,046
They forced me to do it.

140
00:10:16,047 --> 00:10:17,212
Did they?

141
00:10:17,213 --> 00:10:19,504
With a knife at your throat?

142
00:10:19,505 --> 00:10:20,962
Did they put you on a
rack and stretch you

143
00:10:20,963 --> 00:10:22,671
until your bones started to pop?

144
00:10:22,672 --> 00:10:24,588
You don't know what it was like.
I was a child.

145
00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:28,421
So was I. I would have let them kill
me before I betrayed my family.

146
00:10:28,422 --> 00:10:31,254
They told me it was the
only way to save Father.

147
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:33,797
And you were stupid
enough to believe them.

148
00:10:35,547 --> 00:10:38,755
I remember you standing on that
platform with Joffrey and Cersei

149
00:10:38,756 --> 00:10:40,463
when they dragged Father to the block.

150
00:10:40,464 --> 00:10:42,087
I remember the pretty
dress you were wearing.

151
00:10:42,088 --> 00:10:44,464
I remember the fancy
way you did your hair.

152
00:10:46,297 --> 00:10:47,421
You were there?

153
00:10:47,422 --> 00:10:48,713
I was there.

154
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:51,588
Standing in the crowd
near Baelor's statue.

155
00:10:51,589 --> 00:10:53,379
And what did you do?

156
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,796
Did you come running to the rescue?

157
00:10:55,797 --> 00:10:58,588
Did you fight off the
Lannisters and save Father?

158
00:10:58,589 --> 00:11:01,212
- I wanted to.
- But you didn't, just like me.

159
00:11:01,213 --> 00:11:03,796
I didn't betray him. I
didn't betray Robb.

160
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:07,464
I didn't betray our entire
family for my beloved Joffrey.

161
00:11:09,797 --> 00:11:12,796
You should be on your
knees, thanking me.

162
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:16,671
We're standing in Winterfell
again because of me.

163
00:11:16,672 --> 00:11:18,880
You didn't win it back,
Jon didn't win it back.

164
00:11:18,881 --> 00:11:20,962
He lost the Battle of the Bastards.

165
00:11:20,963 --> 00:11:22,713
The Knights of the Vale won the battle,

166
00:11:22,714 --> 00:11:24,338
and they rode north for me.

167
00:11:24,339 --> 00:11:27,630
While you were off, where?
Traveling the world?

168
00:11:27,631 --> 00:11:30,463
- I was training.
- Training.

169
00:11:30,464 --> 00:11:32,338
Well, while you were training,

170
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:35,588
I suffered things you
could never imagine.

171
00:11:35,589 --> 00:11:38,213
Oh, I don't know about that.
I can imagine quite a lot.

172
00:11:40,047 --> 00:11:42,962
You never would have
survived what I survived.

173
00:11:42,963 --> 00:11:45,547
I guess we'll never know.

174
00:11:49,672 --> 00:11:51,505
What are you going to
do with that letter?

175
00:11:53,005 --> 00:11:54,464
I don't know yet.

176
00:11:56,005 --> 00:11:58,796
Who did you show it to?
Where did you find it?

177
00:11:58,797 --> 00:12:00,880
You're scared, aren't you?

178
00:12:00,881 --> 00:12:03,004
What are you scared of?

179
00:12:03,005 --> 00:12:05,004
You didn't commit any crimes.

180
00:12:05,005 --> 00:12:06,838
- No one's going to hang you.
- Well, Arya...

181
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:09,296
You're scared I'll show it
to Jon and he'll be angry.

182
00:12:09,297 --> 00:12:12,671
No, that's not Jon. He'll understand.

183
00:12:12,672 --> 00:12:14,630
You were just a scared little girl,

184
00:12:14,631 --> 00:12:16,838
all alone with the wicked Lannisters.

185
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:20,713
Do you know how happy Cersei would
be right now if she saw us fighting?

186
00:12:20,714 --> 00:12:22,713
This is exactly what she wants.

187
00:12:22,714 --> 00:12:24,796
This is what she's always wanted...
to tear us apart.

188
00:12:24,797 --> 00:12:27,380
You're scared the Northern
lords will read it.

189
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:30,588
They wouldn't think much of Lady Sansa

190
00:12:30,589 --> 00:12:33,588
if they knew how she
did Cersei's bidding.

191
00:12:33,589 --> 00:12:36,588
What would little Lyanna Mormont say?

192
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,755
She's younger than you
were when you wrote this.

193
00:12:39,756 --> 00:12:42,255
Are you going to say,
"But I was just a child?"

194
00:12:44,963 --> 00:12:46,838
You're angry.

195
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:50,046
Sometimes anger makes people
do unfortunate things.

196
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,672
Sometimes fear makes them
do unfortunate things.

197
00:12:54,672 --> 00:12:56,547
I'll go with anger.

198
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,463
You're the one they call "the Dog."

199
00:13:29,464 --> 00:13:31,296
Fuck off.

200
00:13:31,297 --> 00:13:33,087
They told me you were mean.

201
00:13:33,088 --> 00:13:35,504
Were you born mean or
you just hate wildings?

202
00:13:35,505 --> 00:13:37,880
I don't give two shits about wildings.

203
00:13:37,881 --> 00:13:39,588
It's gingers I hate.

204
00:13:39,589 --> 00:13:41,463
Gingers are beautiful.

205
00:13:41,464 --> 00:13:45,046
We are kissed by fire, just like you.

206
00:13:45,047 --> 00:13:47,963
Don't point your fucking finger at me.

207
00:13:52,213 --> 00:13:55,338
Did you trip into the fire
when you were a baby?

208
00:13:55,339 --> 00:13:57,087
I didn't trip, I was pushed.

209
00:13:57,088 --> 00:13:59,004
And ever since, you've been mean.

210
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,630
Will you fuck off?

211
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,588
I don't think you're truly mean.

212
00:14:02,589 --> 00:14:04,130
You have sad eyes.

213
00:14:05,422 --> 00:14:07,129
You want to suck my dick, is that it?

214
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,838
- Dick?
- Cock.

215
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,838
Ah, dick.

216
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,129
I like it.

217
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:15,171
I bet you do.

218
00:14:15,172 --> 00:14:17,796
Nope, it's pussy for me.

219
00:14:17,797 --> 00:14:20,796
I have a beauty waiting for
me back at Winterfell.

220
00:14:20,797 --> 00:14:22,921
If I ever get back there.

221
00:14:22,922 --> 00:14:25,671
Yellow hair, blue eyes,

222
00:14:25,672 --> 00:14:27,880
the tallest woman you've ever seen.

223
00:14:27,881 --> 00:14:29,339
Almost as tall as you.

224
00:14:31,505 --> 00:14:33,671
- Brienne of Tarth.
- You know her?

225
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:36,004
You're with Brienne of fucking Tarth?

226
00:14:36,005 --> 00:14:38,379
Well, not with her yet.

227
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:42,004
- But I see the way she looks at me.
- How does she look at you?

228
00:14:42,005 --> 00:14:44,463
Like she wants to carve you
up and eat your liver?

229
00:14:44,464 --> 00:14:46,212
You do know her.

230
00:14:46,213 --> 00:14:47,671
We've met.

231
00:14:47,672 --> 00:14:49,796
I want to make babies with her.

232
00:14:49,797 --> 00:14:52,796
Think of them... great big monsters.

233
00:14:52,797 --> 00:14:54,379
They'd conquer the world.

234
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:57,962
How did a mad fucker
like you live this long?

235
00:14:57,963 --> 00:14:59,714
I'm good at killing people.

236
00:15:02,631 --> 00:15:04,254
You don't look much like him.

237
00:15:04,255 --> 00:15:05,713
Who's that?

238
00:15:05,714 --> 00:15:07,755
Your father.

239
00:15:07,756 --> 00:15:09,838
I suppose you favor your mother.

240
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,212
You knew him?

241
00:15:12,213 --> 00:15:14,004
'Course I did.

242
00:15:14,005 --> 00:15:15,588
When he was Hand,

243
00:15:15,589 --> 00:15:17,962
he sent me off hunting for the Mountain.

244
00:15:17,963 --> 00:15:19,421
Your wildling friend told me

245
00:15:19,422 --> 00:15:21,713
the red woman brought you back.

246
00:15:21,714 --> 00:15:25,880
Thoros has brought me back six times.

247
00:15:25,881 --> 00:15:28,962
We both serve the same lord.

248
00:15:28,963 --> 00:15:30,880
I serve the North.

249
00:15:30,881 --> 00:15:32,921
The North didn't raise
you from the dead.

250
00:15:32,922 --> 00:15:34,921
The Lord of Light never spoke to me.

251
00:15:34,922 --> 00:15:36,296
I don't know anything about him.

252
00:15:36,297 --> 00:15:37,921
I don't know what he wants from me.

253
00:15:37,922 --> 00:15:41,296
- He wants you alive.
- Why?

254
00:15:41,297 --> 00:15:43,713
I don't know.

255
00:15:43,714 --> 00:15:47,087
That's all anyone can tell me...
"I don't know."

256
00:15:47,088 --> 00:15:48,921
So, what's the point in serving a god

257
00:15:48,922 --> 00:15:51,421
if none of us knows what he wants?

258
00:15:51,422 --> 00:15:54,129
I think about that all the time.

259
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:57,212
I don't think it's our
purpose to understand.

260
00:15:57,213 --> 00:16:00,588
Except one thing... we're soldiers.

261
00:16:00,589 --> 00:16:03,254
We have to know what we're fighting for.

262
00:16:03,255 --> 00:16:06,463
I'm not fighting so some
man or woman I barely know

263
00:16:06,464 --> 00:16:09,504
can sit on a throne made of swords.

264
00:16:09,505 --> 00:16:11,921
So, what are you fighting for?

265
00:16:11,922 --> 00:16:13,322
Life.

266
00:16:14,589 --> 00:16:16,421
Death is the enemy.

267
00:16:16,422 --> 00:16:19,714
The first enemy and the last.

268
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:22,947
But we all die.

269
00:16:24,631 --> 00:16:26,962
The enemy always wins.

270
00:16:26,963 --> 00:16:29,212
And we still need to fight him.

271
00:16:29,213 --> 00:16:31,171
That's all I know.

272
00:16:31,172 --> 00:16:34,630
You and I won't find much
joy while we're here,

273
00:16:34,631 --> 00:16:36,880
but we can keep others alive.

274
00:16:36,881 --> 00:16:39,672
We can defend those who
can't defend themselves.

275
00:16:42,963 --> 00:16:45,880
"I am the shield that
guards the realms of men."

276
00:16:45,881 --> 00:16:49,713
Maybe we don't need to
understand any more than that.

277
00:16:49,714 --> 00:16:51,921
Maybe that's enough.

278
00:16:51,922 --> 00:16:53,322
Aye.

279
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:56,631
Maybe that's enough.

280
00:17:04,422 --> 00:17:07,005
That's what I saw in the fire.

281
00:17:08,172 --> 00:17:10,213
A mountain like an arrowhead.

282
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:13,547
Are you sure?

283
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:18,005
We're getting close.

284
00:17:26,005 --> 00:17:28,005
Do you know what I like about you?

285
00:17:30,297 --> 00:17:33,504
- I honestly don't.
- You're not a hero.

286
00:17:33,505 --> 00:17:35,046
Oh.

287
00:17:35,047 --> 00:17:37,838
Well, I've been heroic on occasion.

288
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:40,630
I once charged through the Mud
Gate of King's Landing and...

289
00:17:40,631 --> 00:17:42,421
I don't want you to be a hero.

290
00:17:42,422 --> 00:17:45,713
Heroes do stupid things and they die.

291
00:17:45,714 --> 00:17:47,755
Drogo, Jorah, Daario,

292
00:17:47,756 --> 00:17:51,046
even this... Jon Snow...

293
00:17:51,047 --> 00:17:53,713
they all try to outdo each other.

294
00:17:53,714 --> 00:17:55,880
Who can do the stupidest, bravest thing.

295
00:17:55,881 --> 00:17:58,880
It's interesting, these heroes you name.

296
00:17:58,881 --> 00:18:01,087
Drogo, Jorah, Daario,

297
00:18:01,088 --> 00:18:04,004
even this... Jon Snow.

298
00:18:04,005 --> 00:18:06,129
They all fell in love with you.

299
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:09,087
- Jon Snow's not in love with me.
- Oh, my mistake.

300
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,796
I suppose he stares at you longingly

301
00:18:10,797 --> 00:18:13,714
because he's hopeful for a
successful military alliance.

302
00:18:17,213 --> 00:18:19,671
He's too little for me.

303
00:18:19,672 --> 00:18:21,504
I didn't mean...

304
00:18:21,505 --> 00:18:24,671
As heroes go, he is quite little.

305
00:18:24,672 --> 00:18:27,087
I know you're brave.

306
00:18:27,088 --> 00:18:29,047
I wouldn't have chosen
a coward as my Hand.

307
00:18:34,088 --> 00:18:36,962
So, if all goes well,

308
00:18:36,963 --> 00:18:39,255
I'll finally get to meet your sister.

309
00:18:40,797 --> 00:18:42,588
From everything you've
told me about her,

310
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:44,921
she'd rather murder me
than speak with me.

311
00:18:44,922 --> 00:18:48,755
Oh, first, she'd torture
you in some horrible way,

312
00:18:48,756 --> 00:18:50,156
then she'd murder you.

313
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:54,796
Nobody trusts my sister
less than I do, believe me.

314
00:18:54,797 --> 00:18:56,588
But if we go to the capital,

315
00:18:56,589 --> 00:18:59,421
we'll go with two armies,
we'll go with three dragons.

316
00:18:59,422 --> 00:19:03,171
Anyone touches you, King's Landing
burns down to the foundation stones.

317
00:19:03,172 --> 00:19:05,212
And right now, she's thinking
of how to set a trap.

318
00:19:05,213 --> 00:19:06,796
Of course she is.

319
00:19:06,797 --> 00:19:09,087
And she's wondering what
trap you're laying for her.

320
00:19:09,088 --> 00:19:10,546
Are we?

321
00:19:10,547 --> 00:19:12,714
Laying any traps?

322
00:19:14,714 --> 00:19:18,046
If we want to create a
new and better world,

323
00:19:18,047 --> 00:19:21,171
I'm not sure deceit and mass
murder is the best way to start.

324
00:19:21,172 --> 00:19:23,963
Which war was won without
deceit and mass murder?

325
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:27,755
Yes, you'll need to be ruthless

326
00:19:27,756 --> 00:19:29,630
if you're going to win the throne.

327
00:19:29,631 --> 00:19:31,671
You need to inspire a degree of fear.

328
00:19:31,672 --> 00:19:34,046
But fear is all Cersei has.

329
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:36,880
It's all my father had, and Joffrey.

330
00:19:36,881 --> 00:19:38,796
It makes their power brittle

331
00:19:38,797 --> 00:19:42,588
because everyone beneath
them longs to see them dead.

332
00:19:42,589 --> 00:19:45,129
Aegon Targaryen got quite
a long way on fear.

333
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:46,796
He did.

334
00:19:46,797 --> 00:19:49,421
But you once spoke to me
of breaking the wheel.

335
00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:50,880
Aegon built a wheel.

336
00:19:50,881 --> 00:19:53,087
If that's the kind of
queen you want to be,

337
00:19:53,088 --> 00:19:55,671
how are you different from all the
other tyrants that came before you?

338
00:19:55,672 --> 00:19:59,087
So we walk into the lions' den.

339
00:19:59,088 --> 00:20:00,755
My brother promised me he'd keep a grip

340
00:20:00,756 --> 00:20:02,379
on the Lannister forces.

341
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:06,254
Forgive me, but I don't care
about any Lannister promises.

342
00:20:06,255 --> 00:20:07,546
Except yours.

343
00:20:07,547 --> 00:20:09,671
And I promised him

344
00:20:09,672 --> 00:20:12,213
I'd keep you from doing
anything impulsive.

345
00:20:13,631 --> 00:20:15,031
Impulsive?

346
00:20:18,547 --> 00:20:21,254
This will be a difficult negotiation.

347
00:20:21,255 --> 00:20:24,796
We're sitting down with people who
want to see us both headless.

348
00:20:24,797 --> 00:20:27,296
My sister is likely to say
something provocative.

349
00:20:27,297 --> 00:20:29,838
- And?
- And you have been known

350
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:32,004
to lose your temper from time to time,

351
00:20:32,005 --> 00:20:33,338
as all great leaders do.

352
00:20:33,339 --> 00:20:35,755
When have I lost my temper?

353
00:20:35,756 --> 00:20:38,296
Burning the Tarlys, for instance.

354
00:20:38,297 --> 00:20:39,838
That was not impulsive.

355
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:42,671
That was necessary.

356
00:20:42,672 --> 00:20:44,588
- Perhaps.
- Perhaps?

357
00:20:44,589 --> 00:20:48,171
Perhaps the father needed
to die and not the son.

358
00:20:48,172 --> 00:20:50,880
Perhaps they both needed time
to contemplate their mistakes

359
00:20:50,881 --> 00:20:53,171
in the solitude of a cold cell.

360
00:20:53,172 --> 00:20:55,588
We had no time to discuss
the possibilities

361
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:57,630
before you ended their possibilities.

362
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,338
One could be forgiven for
thinking you're taking

363
00:20:59,339 --> 00:21:01,171
your family's side in this debate.

364
00:21:01,172 --> 00:21:03,004
I am taking their side.

365
00:21:03,005 --> 00:21:04,713
You need to take your enemy's side

366
00:21:04,714 --> 00:21:06,713
if you're going to see
things the way they do.

367
00:21:06,714 --> 00:21:08,671
And you need to see
things the way they do

368
00:21:08,672 --> 00:21:10,713
if you're going to
anticipate their actions,

369
00:21:10,714 --> 00:21:14,046
respond effectively, and beat them.

370
00:21:14,047 --> 00:21:16,379
Which I want you to do very much.

371
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:19,880
Because I believe in you and in
the world you want to build.

372
00:21:19,881 --> 00:21:22,546
But the world you want to build

373
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:24,129
doesn't get built all at once.

374
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:27,254
Probably not in a single lifetime.

375
00:21:27,255 --> 00:21:30,087
How do we ensure that
your vision endures?

376
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:33,047
After you break the wheel, how
do we make sure it stays broken?

377
00:21:35,589 --> 00:21:38,921
You want to know who sits on the
Iron Throne after I'm dead.

378
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:40,322
Is that it?

379
00:21:41,756 --> 00:21:43,671
You say you can't have children,

380
00:21:43,672 --> 00:21:46,962
but there are other ways
of choosing a successor.

381
00:21:46,963 --> 00:21:49,087
The Night's Watch has one method.

382
00:21:49,088 --> 00:21:51,463
The ironborn, for all their
many flaws, have another.

383
00:21:51,464 --> 00:21:54,171
We will discuss the succession
after I wear the crown.

384
00:21:54,172 --> 00:21:55,921
Your Grace, I saw hundreds of arrows

385
00:21:55,922 --> 00:21:58,254
fly towards you when you
fought on the Blackwater Rush,

386
00:21:58,255 --> 00:22:00,338
and I saw hundreds of arrows miss.

387
00:22:00,339 --> 00:22:02,962
But any one of them could have
found your heart and ended your...

388
00:22:02,963 --> 00:22:06,129
You've been thinking about my
death quite a bit, haven't you?

389
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,713
Is this one of the items you discussed

390
00:22:07,714 --> 00:22:09,421
with your brother in King's Landing?

391
00:22:09,422 --> 00:22:11,880
I'm trying to serve you by
planning for the long term.

392
00:22:11,881 --> 00:22:13,463
Perhaps if you planned
for the short term,

393
00:22:13,464 --> 00:22:15,505
we wouldn't have lost
Dorne and Highgarden.

394
00:22:18,589 --> 00:22:22,797
We will discuss the succession
after I wear the crown.

395
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:02,905
Look!

396
00:23:11,422 --> 00:23:12,822
A bear.

397
00:23:14,172 --> 00:23:15,839
Big fucker.

398
00:23:23,339 --> 00:23:25,672
Do bears have blue eyes?

399
00:25:30,505 --> 00:25:32,172
We have to get him back to Eastwatch.

400
00:25:34,505 --> 00:25:35,905
Flask.

401
00:25:54,963 --> 00:25:56,363
Go on.

402
00:26:12,797 --> 00:26:14,046
You all right?

403
00:26:14,047 --> 00:26:17,796
I just got bit by a dead bear.

404
00:26:17,797 --> 00:26:20,547
Aye, you did.

405
00:26:22,422 --> 00:26:24,339
Funny old life.

406
00:26:26,255 --> 00:26:28,087
Right, then.

407
00:26:28,088 --> 00:26:30,005
We're off.

408
00:26:55,922 --> 00:26:59,129
- Where did she get it?
- I don't know.

409
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:01,255
She seems very resourceful.

410
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:05,338
You're worried.

411
00:27:05,339 --> 00:27:07,004
We're asking 20,000 men

412
00:27:07,005 --> 00:27:10,755
to fight with us in the worst
winter any of them have ever seen.

413
00:27:10,756 --> 00:27:13,755
The weather will be the
least of their problems.

414
00:27:13,756 --> 00:27:16,546
Many of them will be happy to
find a good reason to go home.

415
00:27:16,547 --> 00:27:20,046
- You question their loyalty?
- Their loyalty is to Jon.

416
00:27:20,047 --> 00:27:22,671
Jon is not here. I haven't
heard from him in weeks.

417
00:27:22,672 --> 00:27:24,713
You're the Lady of Winterfell.

418
00:27:24,714 --> 00:27:27,422
The king chose you to
rule in his absence.

419
00:27:29,255 --> 00:27:31,212
And rule you have.

420
00:27:31,213 --> 00:27:34,546
Wisely, ably.

421
00:27:34,547 --> 00:27:37,296
They see that. They respect you.

422
00:27:37,297 --> 00:27:38,713
Some may even prefer you.

423
00:27:38,714 --> 00:27:40,129
Yes, they turned their backs on Jon

424
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:41,546
when it was time to retake Winterfell,

425
00:27:41,547 --> 00:27:43,212
then they named him their king,

426
00:27:43,213 --> 00:27:45,087
and now they're ready to turn
their backs on him again.

427
00:27:45,088 --> 00:27:47,338
How far would you trust men like that?

428
00:27:47,339 --> 00:27:49,421
They're all bloody wind vanes.

429
00:27:49,422 --> 00:27:51,463
If they found out that
I wrote that letter,

430
00:27:51,464 --> 00:27:52,962
a woman who's already married

431
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:56,504
not one, but two enemies of her house...

432
00:27:56,505 --> 00:27:59,546
By the time Jon comes back,
he'll have no army left.

433
00:27:59,547 --> 00:28:01,339
Arya's not like them.

434
00:28:03,756 --> 00:28:05,171
She's your sister.

435
00:28:05,172 --> 00:28:06,962
You may have disagreements,

436
00:28:06,963 --> 00:28:09,421
but she would never betray her family.

437
00:28:09,422 --> 00:28:11,962
She would if she thought I
was going to betray Jon.

438
00:28:11,963 --> 00:28:13,880
Is that what she thinks?

439
00:28:13,881 --> 00:28:15,796
I don't know what she thinks.

440
00:28:15,797 --> 00:28:17,839
I don't know her anymore.

441
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:22,672
Perhaps Lady Brienne could help.

442
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:29,129
She's sworn to protect both
of Catelyn Stark's girls,

443
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:30,530
is she not?

444
00:28:31,963 --> 00:28:33,380
She is.

445
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:41,713
And if one of you were planning
to harm the other in any way,

446
00:28:41,714 --> 00:28:43,839
wouldn't she be honor
bound to intercede?

447
00:28:46,881 --> 00:28:48,339
She would.

448
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:04,796
- Something I've always wanted to know.
- All right.

449
00:29:04,797 --> 00:29:09,046
How drunk were you when you charged
through the breach on Pyke?

450
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:12,839
If I'm being honest, I don't remember
charging through the breach.

451
00:29:14,714 --> 00:29:18,379
Some of the lads told me
about it the next morning.

452
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:20,755
Sounded like a good scrap.

453
00:29:20,756 --> 00:29:23,046
Aye.

454
00:29:23,047 --> 00:29:25,338
It was a proper scrap.

455
00:29:25,339 --> 00:29:28,713
The ironborn thought you
were some kind of god,

456
00:29:28,714 --> 00:29:31,047
the way you were waving
that flaming sword.

457
00:29:32,422 --> 00:29:36,129
I thought you were the
bravest man I ever saw.

458
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:38,005
Just the drunkest.

459
00:30:18,797 --> 00:30:20,212
Where's the rest of them?

460
00:30:20,213 --> 00:30:22,464
If we wait long enough, we'll find out.

461
00:32:52,589 --> 00:32:54,129
Run back to Eastwatch.

462
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:56,338
Get a raven to Daenerys,
tell her what's happened.

463
00:32:56,339 --> 00:32:59,714
- I'm not leaving you.
- You're the fastest. Go, now.

464
00:33:01,255 --> 00:33:03,630
You're faster without the hammer.
Give it.

465
00:33:03,631 --> 00:33:05,031
Give it!

466
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:15,463
- Come on!
- Run!

467
00:33:15,464 --> 00:33:16,963
Come on!

468
00:33:23,465 --> 00:33:25,005
Stop!

469
00:33:42,756 --> 00:33:44,156
Go!

470
00:36:31,464 --> 00:36:33,796
What happened?

471
00:36:33,797 --> 00:36:35,296
Where are the others?

472
00:36:35,297 --> 00:36:38,504
Raven, we need to send a raven.

473
00:36:38,505 --> 00:36:40,297
Get the maester, now!

474
00:37:21,756 --> 00:37:23,156
Thoros?

475
00:37:26,547 --> 00:37:28,005
Thoros.

476
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:48,339
They say it's one of
the better ways to go.

477
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:06,880
Lord of Light, show us the way.

478
00:38:06,881 --> 00:38:10,422
Come to us in our darkness and
lead Your servant into the light.

479
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:17,797
We have to burn his body.

480
00:38:20,839 --> 00:38:23,212
We'll all be close behind him

481
00:38:23,213 --> 00:38:27,088
unless the Lord of Light is kind
enough to send us a bit of fire.

482
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:38,630
Lord of Light,

483
00:38:38,631 --> 00:38:41,296
come to us in our darkness,

484
00:38:41,297 --> 00:38:44,005
for the night is dark
and full of terrors.

485
00:39:07,922 --> 00:39:09,797
We'll all freeze soon.

486
00:39:11,005 --> 00:39:12,922
And so will the water.

487
00:39:16,672 --> 00:39:19,630
When you killed the white walker,

488
00:39:19,631 --> 00:39:23,504
almost all the dead
that followed it fell.

489
00:39:23,505 --> 00:39:25,379
Why?

490
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:27,630
Maybe he was the one who turned them.

491
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:31,004
We can go for the walkers.

492
00:39:31,005 --> 00:39:33,797
No.

493
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:38,130
We need to take that thing back with us.

494
00:39:41,297 --> 00:39:43,755
There's a raven flying
for Dragonstone now.

495
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:47,171
Daenerys is our only chance.

496
00:39:47,172 --> 00:39:50,130
No. There's another.

497
00:39:52,797 --> 00:39:54,197
Kill him.

498
00:39:55,297 --> 00:39:57,005
He turned them all.

499
00:40:01,339 --> 00:40:02,739
You don't understand.

500
00:40:04,213 --> 00:40:05,921
The Lord brought you back.

501
00:40:05,922 --> 00:40:08,129
He brought me back.

502
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:11,212
No one else. Just us.

503
00:40:11,213 --> 00:40:13,589
Did He do it to watch
us freeze to death?

504
00:40:16,047 --> 00:40:19,254
Careful, Beric. You lost your priest.

505
00:40:19,255 --> 00:40:21,046
This is your last life.

506
00:40:21,047 --> 00:40:24,129
I've been waiting for the
end for a long time.

507
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,796
Maybe the Lord brought
me here to find it.

508
00:40:26,797 --> 00:40:30,671
Every lord I've ever met's been a cunt.

509
00:40:30,672 --> 00:40:33,547
Don't see why the Lord of Light
should be any different.

510
00:40:46,756 --> 00:40:48,156
My lady.

511
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:00,296
My lady?

512
00:41:00,297 --> 00:41:04,422
It's an invitation to King's Landing.

513
00:41:10,714 --> 00:41:12,755
My lady, you are the Lady of Winterfell.

514
00:41:12,756 --> 00:41:15,338
I am, and you will
represent my interests

515
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:16,921
at this gathering as you see them.

516
00:41:16,922 --> 00:41:20,297
They invited you. They want you there.

517
00:41:21,797 --> 00:41:23,838
I will not set foot in King's Landing

518
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:26,421
while Cersei Lannister is queen.

519
00:41:26,422 --> 00:41:28,129
If they want another Stark prisoner,

520
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:29,921
they can come and take me.

521
00:41:29,922 --> 00:41:32,671
Until then, I'll remain where I belong.

522
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:34,588
I have work to do here.

523
00:41:37,505 --> 00:41:39,212
It's not safe.

524
00:41:39,213 --> 00:41:41,046
Ser Jaime will be there.

525
00:41:41,047 --> 00:41:43,630
You said he treated
you honorably before.

526
00:41:43,631 --> 00:41:45,630
I'm not worried about me.

527
00:41:45,631 --> 00:41:48,796
It's not safe leaving
you with Littlefinger.

528
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:51,087
I have many guards who would happily

529
00:41:51,088 --> 00:41:52,546
imprison him or behead him

530
00:41:52,547 --> 00:41:53,921
whether or not you're here.

531
00:41:53,922 --> 00:41:56,129
And you trust their loyalty?

532
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:59,796
You trust he hasn't been speaking
to them all behind your back?

533
00:41:59,797 --> 00:42:03,171
Let me at least leave Podrick
behind to watch over you.

534
00:42:03,172 --> 00:42:04,796
He has become a competent swordsman...

535
00:42:04,797 --> 00:42:09,254
I do not need to be watched
over or minded or cared for.

536
00:42:09,255 --> 00:42:10,504
I'm not a child,

537
00:42:10,505 --> 00:42:13,421
I am the Lady of
Winterfell, and I am home.

538
00:42:13,422 --> 00:42:15,464
This is the safest place for me.

539
00:42:16,797 --> 00:42:18,962
My lady,

540
00:42:18,963 --> 00:42:22,819
I swore an oath to protect you and
your sister. If I abandon you...

541
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:24,970
The trip to King's Landing
is long, Lady Brienne,

542
00:42:25,005 --> 00:42:27,546
and you won't be traveling
on summer roads.

543
00:42:27,547 --> 00:42:30,672
The sooner you leave, the better
your chances of making it on time.

544
00:42:34,172 --> 00:42:35,572
Yes, my lady.

545
00:42:58,422 --> 00:43:00,379
You can't.

546
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:02,254
The most important person in the world

547
00:43:02,255 --> 00:43:04,962
can't fly off to the most
dangerous place in the world.

548
00:43:04,963 --> 00:43:07,004
- Who else can?
- No one.

549
00:43:07,005 --> 00:43:09,004
They knew the risks when they left.

550
00:43:09,005 --> 00:43:10,547
You can't win the throne if you're dead.

551
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:14,087
You can't break the
wheel if you're dead.

552
00:43:14,088 --> 00:43:16,379
So, what would you have me do?

553
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:18,171
Nothing.

554
00:43:18,172 --> 00:43:20,255
Sometimes nothing is the
hardest thing to do.

555
00:43:22,631 --> 00:43:26,047
If you die, we're all lost.

556
00:43:27,714 --> 00:43:30,962
Everyone, everything.

557
00:43:30,963 --> 00:43:34,630
You told me to do nothing
before and I listened to you.

558
00:43:34,631 --> 00:43:36,422
I'm not doing nothing again.

559
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:35,255
Dumb cunt.

560
00:44:56,464 --> 00:44:58,839
Oh, fuck.

561
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:38,922
Fuck it.

562
00:47:01,422 --> 00:47:02,822
Yah!

563
00:47:11,797 --> 00:47:13,197
Yah!

564
00:47:32,839 --> 00:47:34,239
Fall back!

565
00:47:35,756 --> 00:47:38,589
- Fall back!
- Come on!

566
00:48:04,839 --> 00:48:06,755
Help me!

567
00:51:02,505 --> 00:51:03,905
Go!

568
00:51:18,922 --> 00:51:20,322
Jon!

569
00:53:10,589 --> 00:53:12,087
Go!

570
00:53:12,088 --> 00:53:14,589
Go now! Leave!

571
00:56:11,505 --> 00:56:13,463
Uncle Benjen!

572
00:56:13,464 --> 00:56:14,864
How?

573
00:56:17,047 --> 00:56:19,796
- You ride for the pass.
- Come with me.

574
00:56:19,797 --> 00:56:21,755
There's no time.

575
00:56:21,756 --> 00:56:23,631
Go!

576
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:39,921
We'll meet again, Clegane.

577
00:57:39,922 --> 00:57:42,255
Fucking hope not.

578
00:58:11,881 --> 00:58:14,088
It's time to go, Your Grace.

579
00:58:16,005 --> 00:58:17,464
A bit longer.

580
00:58:41,297 --> 00:58:43,339
Rider approaching!

581
00:58:51,839 --> 00:58:54,046
Open the gate!

582
01:00:36,213 --> 01:00:38,213
Not what you're looking for?

583
01:00:39,963 --> 01:00:43,380
I have hundreds of men here at
Winterfell, all loyal to me.

584
01:00:45,172 --> 01:00:46,881
They're not here now.

585
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:51,630
What are these?

586
01:00:51,631 --> 01:00:53,047
My faces.

587
01:00:55,547 --> 01:00:57,379
Where did you get them?

588
01:00:57,380 --> 01:01:01,630
In Braavos, while I was
training to be a Faceless Man.

589
01:01:01,631 --> 01:01:03,797
What does that mean?

590
01:01:06,380 --> 01:01:08,296
Back in Braavos,

591
01:01:08,297 --> 01:01:10,962
before I got my first face,

592
01:01:10,963 --> 01:01:13,296
there was a game I used to play.

593
01:01:13,297 --> 01:01:15,504
The Game of Faces.

594
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:17,296
It's simple...

595
01:01:17,297 --> 01:01:19,796
I ask you a question about yourself,

596
01:01:19,797 --> 01:01:23,212
and you try to make lies
sound like the truth.

597
01:01:23,213 --> 01:01:26,254
If you fool me, you win.

598
01:01:26,255 --> 01:01:29,921
If I catch a lie, you lose.

599
01:01:29,922 --> 01:01:32,129
Let's play.

600
01:01:32,130 --> 01:01:35,212
I don't want to play.

601
01:01:35,213 --> 01:01:39,004
How do you feel about Jon being king?

602
01:01:39,005 --> 01:01:42,171
Is there someone else you think
should rule the North instead of him?

603
01:01:42,172 --> 01:01:46,087
Those faces, what are they?

604
01:01:46,088 --> 01:01:48,463
You want to do the asking?

605
01:01:48,464 --> 01:01:50,504
Are you sure?

606
01:01:50,505 --> 01:01:52,338
The Game of Faces
didn't turn out so well

607
01:01:52,339 --> 01:01:54,087
for the last person who
asked me questions.

608
01:01:54,088 --> 01:01:56,047
Tell me what they are.

609
01:01:59,172 --> 01:02:02,339
We both wanted to be other
people when we were younger.

610
01:02:03,505 --> 01:02:05,880
You wanted to be a queen,

611
01:02:05,881 --> 01:02:09,172
to sit next to a handsome,
young king on the Iron Throne.

612
01:02:10,672 --> 01:02:12,962
I wanted to be a knight,

613
01:02:12,963 --> 01:02:16,047
to pick up a sword like
Father and go off to battle.

614
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:22,212
Neither of us got to be
that other person, did we?

615
01:02:22,213 --> 01:02:25,839
The world doesn't just let girls
decide what they're going to be.

616
01:02:27,213 --> 01:02:28,838
But I can now.

617
01:02:28,839 --> 01:02:31,962
With the faces, I can choose.

618
01:02:31,963 --> 01:02:34,255
I can become someone else.

619
01:02:35,714 --> 01:02:38,046
Speak in their voice,

620
01:02:38,047 --> 01:02:39,672
live in their skin.

621
01:02:42,255 --> 01:02:44,881
I could even become you.

622
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:55,087
I wonder what it would feel like

623
01:02:55,088 --> 01:02:57,255
to wear those pretty dresses...

624
01:02:59,047 --> 01:03:01,464
to be the Lady of Winterfell.

625
01:03:03,922 --> 01:03:06,255
All I'd need to find out...

626
01:03:08,380 --> 01:03:09,780
is your face.

627
01:04:08,339 --> 01:04:09,963
I'm sorry.

628
01:04:12,297 --> 01:04:14,088
I'm so sorry.

629
01:04:25,672 --> 01:04:27,963
I wish I could take it back.

630
01:04:30,005 --> 01:04:32,005
I wish we'd never gone.

631
01:04:35,505 --> 01:04:37,005
I don't.

632
01:04:38,672 --> 01:04:41,005
If we hadn't gone, I wouldn't have seen.

633
01:04:43,005 --> 01:04:44,963
You have to see it to know.

634
01:04:46,756 --> 01:04:48,339
Now I know.

635
01:04:51,714 --> 01:04:54,671
The dragons are my children.

636
01:04:54,672 --> 01:04:57,338
They're the only
children I'll ever have.

637
01:04:57,339 --> 01:04:58,963
Do you understand?

638
01:05:04,756 --> 01:05:09,171
We are going to destroy the
Night King and his army.

639
01:05:09,172 --> 01:05:11,047
And we'll do it together.

640
01:05:12,963 --> 01:05:15,005
You have my word.

641
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:19,839
Thank you, Dany.

642
01:05:21,672 --> 01:05:23,046
"Dany"?

643
01:05:24,547 --> 01:05:26,714
Who was the last person
who called me that?

644
01:05:28,547 --> 01:05:31,379
I'm not sure. Was it my brother?

645
01:05:31,380 --> 01:05:34,213
Mm, not the company you want to keep.

646
01:05:35,380 --> 01:05:36,922
All right.

647
01:05:38,714 --> 01:05:40,114
Not "Dany."

01:05:44,213 --> 01:05:46,213
How about "my queen"?

649
01:05:49,672 --> 01:05:53,046
I'd, uh, bend the knee, but...

650
01:05:53,047 --> 01:05:56,212
What about those who
swore allegiance to you?

651
01:05:56,213 --> 01:05:59,422
They'll all come to see
you for what you are.

652
01:06:15,255 --> 01:06:16,922
I hope I deserve it.

653
01:06:18,922 --> 01:06:20,756
You do.

654
01:06:41,297 --> 01:06:42,963
You should get some rest.
