1
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,932
Barry! Please!

2
00:00:14,891 --> 00:00:16,059
That's not me!

3
00:00:22,065 --> 00:00:23,900
This can't be happening.

4
00:00:25,318 --> 00:00:26,598
Are you real?

5
00:00:27,237 --> 00:00:29,698
No. Of course you're not.

6
00:00:29,906 --> 00:00:33,118
That's it.
That's it, I've finally lost it.

7
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:35,078
It's okay. I'm real.

8
00:00:47,173 --> 00:00:49,884
I...

9
00:00:52,095 --> 00:00:56,182
I can't believe I'm talking
to another person. It's been so long.

10
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,769
Wait. I know you.
You and your husband, Joseph Carver,

11
00:00:59,853 --> 00:01:02,188
you founded McCulloch Technologies.
You're Eva McCulloch.

12
00:01:03,982 --> 00:01:05,358
But you're supposed to be dead.

13
00:01:06,401 --> 00:01:09,487
No. Not dead.

14
00:01:09,696 --> 00:01:11,740
Just trapped.

15
00:01:14,367 --> 00:01:15,952
Now so are you.

16
00:01:36,055 --> 00:01:41,019
You see, until now, this place was
a whole world with one inhabitant.

17
00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:44,481
- Me.
- This must be another Earth.

18
00:01:44,814 --> 00:01:46,816
Same Earth, another dimension.

19
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:50,153
You see, a mirror version
of Central City.

20
00:01:50,236 --> 00:01:53,782
Same city, same buildings,
just... empty.

21
00:01:56,326 --> 00:01:57,702
Who are you, anyway?

22
00:01:59,537 --> 00:02:02,373
I'm Iris West-Allen.
I'm a reporter for <i>The CC Citizen.</i>

23
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:06,252
Never heard of it. Not that it matters.

24
00:02:06,461 --> 00:02:09,923
God, it feels so good to have
a conversation that's not one-sided.

25
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:11,966
Everything is backwards.

26
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:16,638
Eva, you said
that this place was a mirror version

27
00:02:16,721 --> 00:02:18,473
of our own. How is that possible?

28
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,100
Think of it like this.

29
00:02:22,352 --> 00:02:24,896
Our reality is observed
by three dimensions

30
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:26,356
with depth and length.

31
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:30,610
But superstring theory posits
that there are other realities.

32
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:33,238
Fractal dimensions humans can't see.

33
00:02:34,113 --> 00:02:35,490
So...

34
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:37,700
two sides.

35
00:02:38,576 --> 00:02:40,537
One, our world.

36
00:02:40,954 --> 00:02:43,748
The other is just an empty reflection.

37
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:49,379
I'm a quantum engineer.
It's my wheelhouse.

38
00:02:56,094 --> 00:02:59,597
Yeah. That is a side effect
of this dimension.

39
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,100
I barely notice them anymore.

40
00:03:04,727 --> 00:03:06,354
How did you end up here, Eva?

41
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:11,192
Six years ago,
I was developing the technology

42
00:03:11,276 --> 00:03:13,903
to open doors
to other planes of existence.

43
00:03:14,112 --> 00:03:15,822
I was in my office

44
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,491
the night Harrison Wells' dream
went up in smoke.

45
00:03:30,295 --> 00:03:31,963
I've been here ever since.

46
00:03:32,463 --> 00:03:35,592
Dark matter must have washed over
that mirror and created a doorway.

47
00:03:36,676 --> 00:03:38,636
I was in this office
when I got pulled in, too.

48
00:03:39,512 --> 00:03:40,889
But that's not all.

49
00:03:41,764 --> 00:03:43,701
There is someone else
on the other side of that mirror.

50
00:03:43,725 --> 00:03:46,561
Another me. How is that possible, Eva?

51
00:03:46,853 --> 00:03:49,397
A fractal variable caused by the mirror.

52
00:03:49,856 --> 00:03:52,150
A duplicate of you.

53
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:54,673
You mean the mirror left
a fake clone of me in the real world?

54
00:03:55,445 --> 00:03:57,196
- We are getting out of here.
- I've tried.

55
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:00,825
For six years,
I've been in my own personal hell.

56
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,328
Eva, I have to go home.

57
00:04:03,578 --> 00:04:05,538
I'm sorry you're stuck here, but...

58
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,793
I thought I was gonna die here alone.

59
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:14,047
At least now, there's two of us.

60
00:04:16,591 --> 00:04:18,509
Investigation into the disappearance

61
00:04:18,593 --> 00:04:20,303
of socialite Sue Dearbon.

62
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:23,890
Day 274...

63
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:27,352
since her parents first hired me
to find her.

64
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:33,274
Status update. Nothing.

65
00:04:33,858 --> 00:04:35,652
Sue's trail went cold in Midway City

66
00:04:35,735 --> 00:04:38,571
after Remington Meister
provided a dead end.

67
00:04:38,655 --> 00:04:41,199
However, she was there.

68
00:04:41,366 --> 00:04:43,034
Meister confirmed that much.

69
00:04:43,493 --> 00:04:44,970
Hey,
what are you still doing here...

70
00:04:44,994 --> 00:04:46,162
Aw, seriously?

71
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:49,540
Ralph, when I left last night
you were standing here,

72
00:04:49,624 --> 00:04:52,627
staring at the exact same board,
same as the night before.

73
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,396
Honey, don't you think maybe
it's time you got a little help

74
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,713
and a shower?

75
00:04:55,797 --> 00:04:58,341
Cecile, this is my process.

76
00:04:58,424 --> 00:05:00,051
I work things out with the only person

77
00:05:00,134 --> 00:05:03,221
that can keep up
with my beautiful detective mind, me.

78
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:06,015
You could work with me.
We took down the FEMA guy together.

79
00:05:06,099 --> 00:05:09,060
That was so great.
You're not loving that. All right, um...

80
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:11,980
Cecile, you know me.
I like doing things my own way.

81
00:05:12,105 --> 00:05:15,817
Ralph, every Holmes needs a Watson.

82
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,694
- Hang on.
- Mmm-hmm.

83
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:22,073
What is it?

84
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:23,741
So, a couple of months ago,

85
00:05:23,825 --> 00:05:25,702
I put up these alerts
on Sue's bank accounts,

86
00:05:25,827 --> 00:05:27,328
trusts and credit cards.

87
00:05:27,537 --> 00:05:30,164
Apparently, she just made
a small deposit on...

88
00:05:31,082 --> 00:05:32,667
an apartment in Central City.

89
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,044
See? Told you.

90
00:05:35,128 --> 00:05:37,547
- Only partner I need is...
- this guy.

91
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,965
Mmm-hmm.

92
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:40,091
See you.

93
00:05:43,011 --> 00:05:45,221
Oh, wow, something definitely
just died in here.

94
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,732
Kara and Lex Luthor?

95
00:05:55,815 --> 00:05:58,568
Man, this post-Crisis world gets harder
to understand every day.

96
00:05:58,651 --> 00:06:00,903
- Right?
- Man.

97
00:06:01,487 --> 00:06:03,781
- What's wrong?
- I'm still sore

98
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:06,909
from our little double date
with Amunet and Goldface.

99
00:06:06,993 --> 00:06:08,161
This feels so weird.

100
00:06:08,286 --> 00:06:10,246
- Maybe you should stay home today.
- No, no.

101
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:13,332
Are you working
on more Black Hole stuff?

102
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:16,252
Yeah. I think I'm getting really close

103
00:06:16,335 --> 00:06:18,755
to taking this son-of-a-bitch down.

104
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:20,298
Hmm.

105
00:06:21,299 --> 00:06:22,257
This is the Mirror Gun.

106
00:06:22,258 --> 00:06:25,554
Yeah. It contains a bleeding-edge
reflective micro-chip technology.

107
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:27,013
If I can examine the gun up close,

108
00:06:27,096 --> 00:06:29,098
then maybe I can find
some kind of small clue

109
00:06:29,182 --> 00:06:32,852
that connects the gun to Black Hole,
since McCulloch created it.

110
00:06:34,103 --> 00:06:36,189
It's still in the Starchives, right?

111
00:06:36,564 --> 00:06:38,107
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

112
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:40,401
Could you, um, get it for me?

113
00:06:42,153 --> 00:06:43,237
Uh...

114
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:47,241
I mean, unlocking a weapon like that
sounds like a bad idea.

115
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,869
Barry, it's me.

116
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:53,372
I know, but, I mean, after what
just happened with you and Carver,

117
00:06:53,456 --> 00:06:55,416
what if the gun fell into
the wrong hands?

118
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,977
Just like
the Cold Gun fell into Snart's.

119
00:06:57,001 --> 00:06:58,836
It won't. Trust me.

120
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,255
Iris, look, you I trust,

121
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:05,802
but the guy who just tried to
have you assassinated, not so much.

122
00:07:05,927 --> 00:07:10,056
And if Black Hole had a weapon
as powerful as the Mirror Gun,

123
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:12,225
I mean, there's no telling
what could happen.

124
00:07:12,642 --> 00:07:15,686
Yeah, you're right.
I'll, um, try a different angle.

125
00:07:18,231 --> 00:07:19,524
I'm just being cautious.

126
00:07:19,899 --> 00:07:20,942
Yeah. No, I get it.

127
00:07:22,235 --> 00:07:23,402
Have fun.

128
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,070
Okay.

129
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,338
Not exactly the Ritz.

130
00:07:49,554 --> 00:07:50,596
Get down!

131
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,021
What the hell, lady?

132
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:00,648
Hey, I just saved your life.

133
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,233
You're welcome, by the way.

134
00:08:05,361 --> 00:08:06,487
Oh, my God.

135
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,657
It's you.

136
00:08:10,867 --> 00:08:12,451
You're Sue Dearbon.

137
00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:14,162
In the flesh.

138
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:16,330
And you are?

139
00:08:22,044 --> 00:08:24,172
No one followed us. We're clear.

140
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:27,842
Sue, I... I have been looking for you
for nine months.

141
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,344
Ouch. I hope you don't bill by the hour.

142
00:08:30,428 --> 00:08:33,723
Where have you been? And why did
your apartment explode in my face?

143
00:08:33,806 --> 00:08:35,266
Yeah. I hate it when that happens.

144
00:08:35,391 --> 00:08:37,351
Look, I'm serious.
Now, who set that bomb?

145
00:08:37,435 --> 00:08:38,620
Why are they trying to kill you?

146
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:40,730
And how long has this been going on for?

147
00:08:40,813 --> 00:08:44,483
Uh, my ex. Because I know too much.
About nine months.

148
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:47,111
- You done?
- No, I'm most certainly not done.

149
00:08:47,236 --> 00:08:50,364
Why is your ex sending you
explosive candygrams?

150
00:08:50,448 --> 00:08:53,242
Ooh, the cheap stuff.

151
00:08:56,579 --> 00:08:59,040
Look, drinks later.

152
00:08:59,123 --> 00:09:02,293
Spilling your guts to tell
a tragic story, that'd be now.

153
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:04,337
Fine. I fell in love with a murderer.

154
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:06,797
Happy?

155
00:09:12,637 --> 00:09:13,930
John Loring.

156
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:17,642
Turns out Mr. Dreamy Muscles
and Charisma for Miles

157
00:09:17,767 --> 00:09:20,519
was also a major arms dealer
on the black market.

158
00:09:20,603 --> 00:09:22,104
So why does Loring want you dead?

159
00:09:22,188 --> 00:09:26,525
Because I stumbled across
his client lists, weapons inventory

160
00:09:26,609 --> 00:09:29,654
and everything else that exposes him
for the bag of crap that he is.

161
00:09:29,946 --> 00:09:32,782
The first time he tried to kill me,
I was asleep.

162
00:09:33,783 --> 00:09:35,034
All right. Well...

163
00:09:36,911 --> 00:09:38,746
- Who are you calling, slick?
- Your parents.

164
00:09:38,913 --> 00:09:41,233
Let them know you're safe.

165
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,626
Hmm.

166
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:46,349
Come on. I just switched plans.

167
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:50,299
John can track your phone.
You call my parents, they're dead.

168
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:52,343
All right, then, uh,
we'll go to the police.

169
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:54,029
I know a precinct captain
who can help us.

170
00:09:54,053 --> 00:09:56,722
The last time I tried that,
they tried to kill me, too.

171
00:09:56,806 --> 00:10:00,059
John's got cops on the payroll
in every city he does business.

172
00:10:02,687 --> 00:10:05,273
Then, what's your plan
to get out of this?

173
00:10:05,815 --> 00:10:08,109
Sue, you can't run forever.

174
00:10:09,402 --> 00:10:10,611
Who says I'm running?

175
00:10:12,363 --> 00:10:14,282
You and Loring are hunting each other.

176
00:10:14,991 --> 00:10:16,534
That's why you're in Central City.

177
00:10:16,742 --> 00:10:18,828
John's in town for a massive sale.

178
00:10:18,911 --> 00:10:21,747
If I can get damning evidence
on what he's doing,

179
00:10:21,831 --> 00:10:22,999
he goes to jail.

180
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,083
And I go home.

181
00:10:25,126 --> 00:10:27,461
I smell a mystery.

182
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:31,215
I smell... expired milk.

183
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:32,776
Look, everything's gonna be fine.

184
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,560
Your parents hired me to do
whatever it takes

185
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:35,970
to bring you home safely,

186
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:37,471
and that's what I'm gonna do.

187
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:39,932
- How?
- Easy.

188
00:10:40,308 --> 00:10:42,476
I'm gonna find Loring.
I'm gonna get you evidence.

189
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,912
Then I'm going to take you to C.C.P.D.

190
00:10:43,936 --> 00:10:46,147
And after I do that,
I'm gonna take you home.

191
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:49,191
John's a killer.
You'd be risking your life.

192
00:10:50,109 --> 00:10:51,109
For me.

193
00:10:52,445 --> 00:10:54,697
If you get killed...

194
00:10:57,366 --> 00:10:59,201
my parents are out good money.

195
00:10:59,869 --> 00:11:00,869
I'm coming with you.

196
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:07,418
One thousand,
three hundred and twenty-two.

197
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:11,505
One thousand, three hundred
and twenty-two.

198
00:11:13,215 --> 00:11:15,634
Eva, there has got to be
a way out of here

199
00:11:15,718 --> 00:11:16,862
that we haven't thought of yet.

200
00:11:16,886 --> 00:11:18,512
There isn't.

201
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:21,223
There's only two options in this place.

202
00:11:21,307 --> 00:11:24,018
Survival or madness.

203
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:28,189
Eva, my husband will be
looking for me. Please...

204
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:31,776
This is how it all starts!
Don't you understand?

205
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:34,403
You sit here and you think
everything's going to work out!

206
00:11:34,487 --> 00:11:36,655
You cannot possibly stay here forever!

207
00:11:36,739 --> 00:11:40,284
And then, 1,322!

208
00:11:41,744 --> 00:11:43,746
That's how many times
I tried to escape this place!

209
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:46,957
That's how many times I failed!

210
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:49,835
One thousand, three hundred
and twenty-two reminders

211
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:52,254
that I am never leaving this place.

212
00:11:54,840 --> 00:12:00,096
So please don't... give me another one.

213
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:10,731
I'm having a really bad hair day.

214
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,237
I'm sorry.

215
00:12:17,655 --> 00:12:19,740
I've been alone for a very long time.

216
00:12:20,825 --> 00:12:22,284
Well, you're not anymore.

217
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:26,831
We just need one way out of here, Eva.
That's it.

218
00:12:31,836 --> 00:12:33,129
Sam Scudder.

219
00:12:34,422 --> 00:12:35,464
Who?

220
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,967
He was one of the bad guys.
He trapped...

221
00:12:38,968 --> 00:12:41,804
someone in a mirror, a few years ago,

222
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:44,932
and my friends got him out
by bringing it to absolute zero.

223
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:47,685
Eva, we just need to find
some liquid nitrogen.

224
00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:51,105
Well, I have a lab down the hall.
There should be some in there.

225
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:54,233
The nitrogen should slow down
the mirror's molecules

226
00:12:54,316 --> 00:12:58,195
to the lowest entropy state possible.
Oh, my God.

227
00:12:59,155 --> 00:13:00,573
This could work.

228
00:13:07,288 --> 00:13:09,165
Hey, Barr. Morning.

229
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:10,666
- Hi.
- You got a second?

230
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,085
Yeah. What's up, Captain?
That never gets old.

231
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:17,465
It kind of does.
Uh, listen, there was a house fire

232
00:13:17,548 --> 00:13:19,216
- on Baton Street last month.
- Okay.

233
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:21,760
The occupant died of smoke inhalation.

234
00:13:22,094 --> 00:13:24,597
Uh, I'm wondering
if you could take a second look.

235
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:26,849
Joe, this case was already declared
an accident.

236
00:13:27,016 --> 00:13:31,103
Yeah, I, uh, need a fresh pair
of eyes on it.

237
00:13:32,396 --> 00:13:34,440
Okay. I mean, what am I looking for?

238
00:13:34,565 --> 00:13:35,774
Whatever you find.

239
00:13:37,109 --> 00:13:40,112
Joe, I mean, I've got a mountain
of cases I need to go through,

240
00:13:40,196 --> 00:13:41,906
ones that haven't been solved already.

241
00:13:42,031 --> 00:13:46,535
Okay. All I can say is
that you'd be doing me a favor.

242
00:13:47,286 --> 00:13:50,372
And whatever you find, Barr,
bring it directly to me.

243
00:13:51,624 --> 00:13:52,625
Okay.

244
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:54,585
Thank you.

245
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:03,969
John owns that warehouse.
That's where the deal will go down.

246
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:05,970
Where are you going?

247
00:14:07,223 --> 00:14:09,266
- I'm going with you.
- No, no, no.

248
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:12,394
Oh, Look, I get it,
chivalry's your brand...

249
00:14:12,478 --> 00:14:14,313
You're an MIT grad, speak six languages,

250
00:14:14,438 --> 00:14:15,481
and you play polo.

251
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:17,125
You belong in a country club,
not in the field.

252
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:20,444
You belong
in the 19th century with your Victorian

253
00:14:20,528 --> 00:14:22,279
"save the damsel in distress" crap.

254
00:14:22,363 --> 00:14:26,617
Loring doesn't know that I'm coming,
so I have the element of surprise.

255
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:28,160
You, on the other hand,

256
00:14:28,244 --> 00:14:29,554
he might kind of know
that you're coming.

257
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:31,956
Translation, stay in the car. Please.

258
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:55,938
I hope Loring looks good in orange.

259
00:14:59,567 --> 00:15:02,027
Uh, I don't suppose
you're a fellow bird-watcher?

260
00:15:05,197 --> 00:15:06,448
Huh.

261
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,170
Hey, Vin Diesel!

262
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:26,844
You still want me to wait in the car?

263
00:15:38,522 --> 00:15:41,358
So, you mind telling me
how you know martial arts?

264
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:43,611
My parents sent me to Kyoto
for a summer.

265
00:15:43,736 --> 00:15:46,697
Trained with a blind sensei.
Taught me everything I know.

266
00:15:46,864 --> 00:15:48,240
- Really?
- No.

267
00:15:48,616 --> 00:15:50,326
I trained with a guy named Frank
at a YMCA.

268
00:15:52,036 --> 00:15:55,581
Will you relax? We're safe here.
John's not stupid.

269
00:15:55,706 --> 00:15:56,999
Killing me in a public place?

270
00:15:57,082 --> 00:15:58,268
Uh-uh,
It's not gonna happen.

271
00:15:58,292 --> 00:16:01,712
I'm sorry. I believe he blew up
an apartment to get to you.

272
00:16:01,837 --> 00:16:04,006
That building was scheduled
for demolition next month.

273
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:06,967
But he does know
that someone's after him now.

274
00:16:07,468 --> 00:16:09,970
It'll make him harder to get to,
thanks to you.

275
00:16:12,181 --> 00:16:13,349
Where are you going?

276
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:15,017
Sorry, slick.

277
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,536
I can't partner up with someone
who doesn't think

278
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,896
- I can pull my own weight.
- Hang on a second, Sue.

279
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:21,857
Hang on. Will you just hang on
one second, please?

280
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:25,319
Look, when I take a case,
I see it through to the end.

281
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:28,405
And this doesn't end until you're safe.

282
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:29,865
Do you trust me, Ralph?

283
00:16:31,909 --> 00:16:33,410
I just met you.

284
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:36,705
But you did save my keister, twice.

285
00:16:37,456 --> 00:16:38,916
And that means I owe you.

286
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:40,376
And I always pay my debts.

287
00:16:40,793 --> 00:16:42,002
I'll take that as a yes.

288
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:47,007
- So, without those pictures...
- We are back to square one.

289
00:16:47,216 --> 00:16:48,967
Fortunately,
we still have John's ledger.

290
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:51,970
He keeps a detailed record
of every deal he's ever made in it.

291
00:16:52,054 --> 00:16:53,263
Years of evidence against him.

292
00:16:53,389 --> 00:16:55,575
But his office is still on
the seventh floor of that warehouse.

293
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:57,285
Which has probably doubled
its security by now.

294
00:16:57,309 --> 00:16:58,787
The sewer system, that's a good way in.

295
00:16:58,811 --> 00:17:00,830
Those tunnels, they lead directly
to the center of the building.

296
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:02,707
And then we time our entry
for when the guards...

297
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:03,857
Change shifts.

298
00:17:03,941 --> 00:17:06,151
And then we mosey up the stairs
into Loring's office,

299
00:17:06,235 --> 00:17:07,528
we get the prize.

300
00:17:07,611 --> 00:17:08,946
Well, you are slick.

301
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:12,533
Oh, my God, Ralph, you found her!

302
00:17:13,242 --> 00:17:14,743
Oh, technically, I found him.

303
00:17:17,413 --> 00:17:18,997
Sue Dearbon.

304
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:20,081
- Hi.
- Hi.

305
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:21,583
Cecile Horton, metahuman attorney,

306
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:24,420
but I also have 20 years of experience

307
00:17:24,503 --> 00:17:25,587
defending non-metahumans.

308
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:27,631
The law is my game, Cecile is my name.

309
00:17:27,715 --> 00:17:29,776
I can cover you no matter what
you've had going on all this time...

310
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,803
- Could I get a quick word?
- Oh, gotcha. Just one sec.

311
00:17:35,139 --> 00:17:38,934
Listen, we're, we're kind of
in the middle of something.

312
00:17:39,435 --> 00:17:40,829
Uh, Sue's been on the run
for the last year.

313
00:17:40,853 --> 00:17:42,730
It turns out that someone's after her.

314
00:17:44,356 --> 00:17:47,109
And you're her knight in shining armor.

315
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:49,445
Ralph, I love it!

316
00:17:49,528 --> 00:17:51,905
By the way, you two, hmm...

317
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:54,950
When I read the both of you
with my powers,

318
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:57,077
I could barely tell you apart.

319
00:17:57,161 --> 00:17:59,455
Like, emotionally speaking,

320
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:03,625
you and Sue are definitely
surfing the same wave.

321
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:07,004
Just trying to keep her safe.
I mean, it's not like we're dating.

322
00:18:07,296 --> 00:18:08,630
Do you want more coffee?

323
00:18:08,964 --> 00:18:10,132
No.

324
00:18:13,177 --> 00:18:15,763
I can't believe
I didn't think of this before.

325
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,184
You would have, eventually.

326
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:35,032
What's happening?

327
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:45,417
No.

328
00:18:46,418 --> 00:18:47,669
It should have worked.

329
00:18:48,045 --> 00:18:49,087
No.

330
00:18:51,632 --> 00:18:52,716
No.

331
00:19:06,772 --> 00:19:09,316
I really thought
I was going back to my old life.

332
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:11,693
Eva, you will.

333
00:19:12,486 --> 00:19:15,280
Yeah, it doesn't even matter anymore.

334
00:19:17,741 --> 00:19:19,493
My sweet Joseph.

335
00:19:20,619 --> 00:19:22,162
We were so in love.

336
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:26,917
I saw him in the mirror.

337
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:33,423
I watched him for five years
as he mourned, grieved and...

338
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:36,885
moved on.

339
00:19:38,512 --> 00:19:40,472
And I can't. I...

340
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,517
I can't move on.

341
00:20:13,255 --> 00:20:15,215
Oh, my gosh, Nash.

342
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:19,011
I didn't think anyone else
would be down here.

343
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:21,889
I lost something down here, so...

344
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:26,560
Oh, right. Well, that makes sense.
These Starchives are so massive.

345
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:28,103
- Okay.
- Okay.

346
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:32,065
I'm sorry,
what were you doing down here?

347
00:20:32,441 --> 00:20:35,694
Cisco asked me to hold down the fort
while he, uh...

348
00:20:36,278 --> 00:20:39,281
He wanted me to take the inventory,
so I gotta do that. Sucks.

349
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:40,449
That's a lie.

350
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:46,955
Uh, what are you doing here?

351
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,459
I lost Nora's journal.
I haven't seen it for a couple of weeks.

352
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:55,213
And, um, you know, it's the only thing
I have left of my daughter.

353
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:57,299
- So...
- Uh, must be hard.

354
00:20:57,507 --> 00:20:58,675
You would know, wouldn't you?

355
00:21:00,218 --> 00:21:02,458
Now that I think about it,
that's probably...

356
00:21:02,638 --> 00:21:05,265
I am digging up the past and...

357
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:09,478
You know, maybe I should
start living in the present.

358
00:21:09,978 --> 00:21:11,331
- So should we all.
- Mmm-hmm.

359
00:21:11,355 --> 00:21:14,816
But it's difficult for you,
isn't it, Nash?

360
00:21:15,901 --> 00:21:17,945
With so much unfinished business.

361
00:21:18,946 --> 00:21:21,281
- Look, Nash, Barry...
- Right.

362
00:21:21,615 --> 00:21:23,492
...doesn't know about this.

363
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:24,575
He would be crushed

364
00:21:24,618 --> 00:21:26,012
if he knew that I lost
anything of Nora's.

365
00:21:26,036 --> 00:21:32,000
So could you maybe not mention
me being down here?

366
00:21:32,084 --> 00:21:34,795
Maybe you should mention
why you're down here.

367
00:21:35,504 --> 00:21:36,922
It'll be our little secret.

368
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:38,548
I always knew I liked you.

369
00:22:08,036 --> 00:22:09,997
Loring's office is
right up those stairs.

370
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:11,623
Last one there buys the Gingold.

371
00:22:14,001 --> 00:22:15,043
Hey!

372
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:16,795
Freeze! Stop or we'll shoot!

373
00:22:25,137 --> 00:22:26,805
- At least he's not a pack rat.
- Focus.

374
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,265
Uh...

375
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:32,936
- Not finding it.
- Search faster.

376
00:22:35,689 --> 00:22:37,649
- Think I've got something.
- That's not a ledger.

377
00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:40,068
No. It's a key for a safety deposit box

378
00:22:40,152 --> 00:22:41,570
at the CC Mercantile Bank,

379
00:22:41,737 --> 00:22:44,007
where I'm guessing your ex
hid the ledger for safekeeping.

380
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:47,242
Good point. Time to go.

381
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:57,461
Uh, we have a problem.

382
00:22:57,627 --> 00:22:59,504
- Do you trust me?
- Define "trust."

383
00:23:00,464 --> 00:23:01,923
Hang on.

384
00:23:02,007 --> 00:23:03,467
Are you crazy?

385
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:05,719
Sometimes. Don't let go.

386
00:23:19,357 --> 00:23:21,902
We just... You just...

387
00:23:23,653 --> 00:23:25,197
You're the Elongated Man?

388
00:23:25,363 --> 00:23:27,157
Yeah, I'm just full of surprises.

389
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,960
How did you become
the Elongated Man, anyway?

390
00:23:39,711 --> 00:23:42,798
I was brutally experimented on
by a covert organization for years.

391
00:23:42,964 --> 00:23:45,509
They forced me to consume
rubber-based polymer compounds.

392
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:47,469
- Seriously?
- No.

393
00:23:48,595 --> 00:23:49,638
I rode a bus.

394
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:54,976
So you're like
an honest-to-God superhero.

395
00:23:57,145 --> 00:23:59,481
- What's that like?
- It's like any other job you love.

396
00:23:59,564 --> 00:24:01,858
It's rewarding as hell.

397
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:05,570
But boy, the hours,
let me tell you.

398
00:24:05,654 --> 00:24:07,656
Seriously, you're like a...

399
00:24:10,283 --> 00:24:11,284
good person.

400
00:24:11,368 --> 00:24:13,411
I helped you get a key. It's no ledger.

401
00:24:13,537 --> 00:24:18,208
Well, Loring's ledger will definitely
be in the box that goes with this.

402
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:19,891
And now we know
where the box is located.

403
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,962
All we have to do is open it.

404
00:24:22,045 --> 00:24:23,755
And then, you can get back to your life.

405
00:24:24,756 --> 00:24:25,799
Listen...

406
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,761
I want you to know
how much I appreciate you...

407
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,139
trusting me with your secret.

408
00:24:33,223 --> 00:24:34,391
It means a lot.

409
00:24:38,854 --> 00:24:40,438
Uh...

410
00:24:40,522 --> 00:24:42,649
I can call my friends at C.C.P.D.
and get a warrant

411
00:24:42,732 --> 00:24:45,485
for Loring's deposit box.
Shouldn't take more than a day.

412
00:24:45,569 --> 00:24:47,279
We don't have a day.

413
00:24:47,362 --> 00:24:50,157
Loring's already spooked.
He can move that box at any minute.

414
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,368
I feel like our only chance...
No, it's too crazy.

415
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:55,213
Come on,
share your thoughts with the class.

416
00:24:57,414 --> 00:24:58,582
What if...

417
00:25:01,126 --> 00:25:03,712
we break into CC Mercantile Bank now.

418
00:25:04,212 --> 00:25:06,756
Just us,
and take the ledger for ourselves.

419
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,175
I believe that's called stealing.

420
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,093
Oh, come on, slick.

421
00:25:10,635 --> 00:25:11,970
You're also a PI.

422
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:14,723
You can't tell me
you've always operated by the book.

423
00:25:14,806 --> 00:25:17,184
No, but I can't commit a crime.

424
00:25:20,645 --> 00:25:21,730
I get it.

425
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:23,607
And I respect that.

426
00:25:24,316 --> 00:25:26,818
But, Ralph, I'm not a hero.

427
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:30,655
So if this is the only chance I have
to see my parents again...

428
00:25:31,656 --> 00:25:32,949
I have to take it.

429
00:25:34,284 --> 00:25:37,204
Sue, being a hero,

430
00:25:37,746 --> 00:25:40,248
it's about helping innocent people.

431
00:25:41,249 --> 00:25:43,168
I'm not going to let you do this alone.

432
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,420
- You're not?
- No.

433
00:25:45,879 --> 00:25:47,839
But we do this my way.

434
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:50,133
We get inside, get the ledger

435
00:25:50,258 --> 00:25:52,886
and immediately bring it
to my friends at C.C.P.D.

436
00:25:53,637 --> 00:25:55,805
Deal or no deal?

437
00:25:58,683 --> 00:25:59,768
Deal.

438
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:07,108
- So, what'd you find out?
- These scorch marks...

439
00:26:07,192 --> 00:26:08,252
- Yeah.
- ...they're giant burns,

440
00:26:08,276 --> 00:26:10,487
like sunlight
through a magnifying glass.

441
00:26:11,238 --> 00:26:13,782
So in your expert CSI opinion...

442
00:26:13,865 --> 00:26:16,326
The fire was started by UV light rays.

443
00:26:16,534 --> 00:26:18,870
Same way Dr. Light torched <i>The CC Citizen.</i>

444
00:26:21,998 --> 00:26:24,000
Joe, what's going on?

445
00:26:24,876 --> 00:26:28,672
Look, this isn't the only file
I've found where it looks like

446
00:26:28,755 --> 00:26:31,132
something has fallen through the cracks.

447
00:26:31,675 --> 00:26:35,512
All of these cases involve
accidental deaths.

448
00:26:35,595 --> 00:26:39,474
All the victims are associated
with this guy Joseph Carver.

449
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:43,270
I'm starting to think
that somebody here in C.C.P.D.

450
00:26:43,353 --> 00:26:45,063
is helping him cover this up.

451
00:26:49,192 --> 00:26:50,527
You think there's a mole here?

452
00:26:50,902 --> 00:26:52,696
Carver's influence runs deep, man.

453
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:56,199
Governors, Mayor, CEOs.

454
00:26:56,366 --> 00:26:57,617
Okay. Right, um...

455
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:02,163
Look, this is
what Iris is already investigating.

456
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:05,542
Her lead had to do
with the Mirror Gun that we stole

457
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:07,335
from McCulloch Technologies last year.

458
00:27:07,419 --> 00:27:09,421
It fell through
because I wouldn't give it to her.

459
00:27:10,213 --> 00:27:12,233
Why wouldn't you give it to her?
I mean, was it dangerous?

460
00:27:12,257 --> 00:27:14,050
Yeah. I mean,
it could put her in danger.

461
00:27:14,175 --> 00:27:16,655
I don't trust what the world might do
if the gun got out there.

462
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,388
You're right, the world is crazy,

463
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:21,641
but it's clear
that Carver is really dangerous.

464
00:27:21,725 --> 00:27:24,311
Iris is your partner and family.

465
00:27:24,436 --> 00:27:26,717
And I don't think we can
trust this right now with anybody

466
00:27:26,771 --> 00:27:29,316
other than family.

467
00:27:33,737 --> 00:27:35,423
I'm sorry you're not gonna see
your husband again,

468
00:27:35,447 --> 00:27:37,073
but it's easier if you just accept it.

469
00:27:37,157 --> 00:27:40,869
Eva, you said that you want
to go back to your old life.

470
00:27:41,703 --> 00:27:44,789
Look, maybe it's gone,
but you can start a new one.

471
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:47,834
I'm glad it's broken.

472
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:51,755
I'm glad it's broken.

473
00:27:54,924 --> 00:27:57,802
I'm tired of looking at a world
that doesn't want me anyway.

474
00:27:58,762 --> 00:28:02,766
I'm tired of waiting for someone
to come and rescue me.

475
00:28:02,849 --> 00:28:06,728
And I am sick and tired
of people telling me

476
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:09,689
that everything is gonna be all right
because it isn't.

477
00:28:10,315 --> 00:28:12,609
It's never gonna be all right!

478
00:28:13,318 --> 00:28:14,402
Never!

479
00:28:23,995 --> 00:28:25,205
What just happened?

480
00:28:27,791 --> 00:28:30,001
I think we just found
our way out of here.

481
00:28:32,462 --> 00:28:34,506
And you're sure this is necessary?

482
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:36,966
A credible tip came in to C.C.P.D.

483
00:28:37,092 --> 00:28:39,719
saying this branch was
a target for robbery, so yes.

484
00:28:39,844 --> 00:28:42,931
Well, this is
the only way in or out of the vault.

485
00:28:43,014 --> 00:28:46,101
The inner gate is fitted with
an anti-theft electrical system.

486
00:28:46,184 --> 00:28:48,895
Opening or closing it
without the manager's key

487
00:28:48,978 --> 00:28:51,940
automatically activates
a 50,000-volt fail-safe.

488
00:28:52,023 --> 00:28:53,733
An electric fence to keep the cattle in.

489
00:28:53,817 --> 00:28:56,277
- Yeah.
- Smart. Thanks, pal.

490
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:00,990
Sweet fancy Moses.

491
00:29:02,492 --> 00:29:03,743
Hmm.

492
00:29:05,245 --> 00:29:08,623
Oh, I understand why people
are grossed out when I do that.

493
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,291
Your turn, slick.

494
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:11,418
Oh, right.

495
00:29:17,382 --> 00:29:19,759
You know,
besides a passion for fisticuffs,

496
00:29:19,884 --> 00:29:21,594
you've got a real knack
for detective work.

497
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,972
You ever think about
getting behind a desk?

498
00:29:24,431 --> 00:29:27,267
Ugh, that sounds worse
than my boarding school.

499
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:30,395
Or the times my parents made me
take horseback riding lessons.

500
00:29:30,562 --> 00:29:34,941
Or learning French every Saturday
at the US embassy in Paris.

501
00:29:38,736 --> 00:29:41,281
Gee, your childhood sounds just awful.

502
00:29:43,032 --> 00:29:44,826
I didn't say it was awful.

503
00:29:45,618 --> 00:29:47,454
It just wasn't me.

504
00:29:48,788 --> 00:29:53,126
The truth is I always hated
the whole... socialite scene,

505
00:29:54,085 --> 00:29:57,797
which is why one day I woke up
and realized I had no idea who I was.

506
00:29:59,507 --> 00:30:02,260
Guess I still haven't figured out
exactly where I belong.

507
00:30:04,053 --> 00:30:06,723
Poor little rich girl.
How could she be so lost?

508
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:10,310
No, I... I get it.

509
00:30:11,394 --> 00:30:13,062
I used to wear that uniform
you've got on.

510
00:30:14,147 --> 00:30:16,107
I was a cop, and a damn good one.

511
00:30:16,983 --> 00:30:19,903
And then, that ended abruptly
and I got lost, too.

512
00:30:21,237 --> 00:30:24,407
Then I rode that bus
and found where I belong.

513
00:30:25,492 --> 00:30:27,827
So you're saying there's hope for me?

514
00:30:27,952 --> 00:30:29,329
There is from where I'm standing.

515
00:30:34,751 --> 00:30:37,212
So, partner.

516
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,966
It's a big moment.
You mind if I do the honors?

517
00:30:42,342 --> 00:30:43,468
Of course.

518
00:30:45,345 --> 00:30:46,554
You earned it.

519
00:30:57,565 --> 00:30:59,943
- Found it.
- Must be a tiny ledger.

520
00:31:00,068 --> 00:31:01,128
Now, what do you say we get out

521
00:31:01,152 --> 00:31:02,672
of here and play <i>Mario Kart...</i>

522
00:31:05,865 --> 00:31:07,867
What the hell?

523
00:31:11,454 --> 00:31:13,873
I guess you're not the only one
who's full of surprises.

524
00:31:22,173 --> 00:31:24,050
We are this close to taking down Loring.

525
00:31:24,175 --> 00:31:25,385
Ahh!

526
00:31:26,803 --> 00:31:29,013
Sue, why are you doing this?

527
00:31:29,722 --> 00:31:32,308
Who cares about Loring?
I don't even know the guy.

528
00:31:32,725 --> 00:31:36,437
I do, however,
know where he keeps his valuables.

529
00:31:40,692 --> 00:31:42,026
There never was a ledger.

530
00:31:42,902 --> 00:31:44,362
- Keep going.
- That's why you rented

531
00:31:44,445 --> 00:31:45,822
an apartment in Central City.

532
00:31:46,531 --> 00:31:51,286
You knew I was keeping tabs on you,
so you lured me in.

533
00:31:52,287 --> 00:31:54,289
You rigged your own apartment
to explode?

534
00:31:54,372 --> 00:31:58,167
For what? Just to sell the story
of a sympathetic socialite

535
00:31:58,251 --> 00:32:00,336
- running for her life?
- You bought it.

536
00:32:01,838 --> 00:32:05,008
But don't feel bad, you're a good guy.

537
00:32:05,717 --> 00:32:07,260
And a hero.

538
00:32:07,552 --> 00:32:09,387
You probably see the best in everyone.

539
00:32:09,512 --> 00:32:12,056
Me, I see what I want.

540
00:32:12,849 --> 00:32:14,058
And I take it.

541
00:32:15,018 --> 00:32:17,770
You used my detective mind
to track down Loring's deposit box.

542
00:32:19,355 --> 00:32:21,482
You, you played everyone.

543
00:32:22,358 --> 00:32:24,694
Your parents are desperate to find you.

544
00:32:26,821 --> 00:32:28,340
Do they even know what you really are?

545
00:32:28,364 --> 00:32:31,075
No. That's our little secret.

546
00:32:31,701 --> 00:32:35,246
If they found out
their only daughter was a thief,

547
00:32:36,289 --> 00:32:37,582
they'd be devastated.

548
00:32:38,124 --> 00:32:40,084
So you keep your mouth shut
about who I am,

549
00:32:40,168 --> 00:32:42,253
I keep mine shut about who you are.

550
00:32:42,754 --> 00:32:44,088
Deal, Elongated Man?

551
00:32:46,215 --> 00:32:48,760
Sue, was anything you told me real?

552
00:32:50,094 --> 00:32:51,346
Yes.

553
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,222
And no.

554
00:32:53,681 --> 00:32:54,891
See you around, slick.

555
00:33:10,323 --> 00:33:13,618
C.C.P.D. You're all under arrest.

556
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:18,206
Nice try, Officer, but I have
a silent alarm in my deposit box,

557
00:33:18,289 --> 00:33:20,375
so I know you stole that from me.

558
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:24,420
No phone.

559
00:33:24,504 --> 00:33:27,423
Can't stretch through these bars
without getting seriously toasty.

560
00:33:32,261 --> 00:33:33,596
Always come prepared.

561
00:33:34,472 --> 00:33:35,682
You don't want to do this.

562
00:33:35,807 --> 00:33:36,849
Yeah, I do.

563
00:33:37,183 --> 00:33:38,351
I'm that guy.

564
00:33:52,156 --> 00:33:53,908
You're not getting rid of me
that easily.

565
00:33:55,368 --> 00:33:57,203
- Give us a minute.
- Kill them both.

566
00:34:01,499 --> 00:34:02,959
I'm inside you?

567
00:34:03,042 --> 00:34:04,687
Do you have any idea
how disgusting this is?

568
00:34:04,711 --> 00:34:07,004
- I'm saving your life.
- No, you're not.

569
00:34:07,171 --> 00:34:09,590
We are not partners.
I've handled being shot at before.

570
00:34:09,716 --> 00:34:11,050
Why does that not surprise me?

571
00:34:11,134 --> 00:34:12,343
- Let me out.
- Sure.

572
00:34:12,427 --> 00:34:14,071
I'll let you out, and then
I'll take you to Iron Heights

573
00:34:14,095 --> 00:34:15,695
as soon as these idiots run out of ammo.

574
00:34:18,683 --> 00:34:21,936
- Ugh, do you ever shut up? Do something.
- I am doing something.

575
00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:24,206
What's your contribution
to this quaint little scenario?

576
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:27,191
Oh, wait, nothing.
This is all your fault.

577
00:34:29,944 --> 00:34:31,320
Always come prepared.

578
00:34:55,595 --> 00:34:57,395
Is there anyone
that doesn't want to kill you?

579
00:34:57,513 --> 00:34:58,639
Not really.

580
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,150
I have really gotta learn Spanish.

581
00:35:20,244 --> 00:35:21,329
You want the diamond?

582
00:35:22,622 --> 00:35:23,623
Come and get it.

583
00:35:23,647 --> 00:35:25,647
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

584
00:36:16,801 --> 00:36:18,521
Looks like we've both been had.

585
00:36:24,976 --> 00:36:26,269
She softened him up.

586
00:36:27,478 --> 00:36:28,896
Let's finish the job.

587
00:36:36,737 --> 00:36:38,865
- It's all yours, Captain West.
- Thanks, Flash.

588
00:36:39,198 --> 00:36:40,449
Clear this out, guys.

589
00:36:40,616 --> 00:36:41,826
Hey, bud.

590
00:36:42,326 --> 00:36:43,953
- Flash. It's him.
- Yeah?

591
00:36:44,036 --> 00:36:45,121
He's the one who robbed us.

592
00:36:45,496 --> 00:36:46,496
Excuse me?

593
00:36:46,539 --> 00:36:48,124
It's a case of mistaken identity, sir.

594
00:36:48,207 --> 00:36:49,834
I'm sure Captain West can explain.

595
00:36:51,335 --> 00:36:52,336
It's all right.

596
00:36:54,463 --> 00:36:56,424
Hey, man, I'm sorry. I got word late.

597
00:36:56,507 --> 00:36:58,467
But I searched the whole area.
Ultraviolet's gone.

598
00:36:58,593 --> 00:36:59,760
I couldn't stop her.

599
00:37:00,011 --> 00:37:02,430
Don't worry, we'll get her. I promise.

600
00:37:02,513 --> 00:37:04,265
I wasn't talking about Ultraviolet.

601
00:37:12,231 --> 00:37:14,901
Loring's in custody,
but facial recognition

602
00:37:14,984 --> 00:37:16,944
isn't picking her up
anywhere in Central City.

603
00:37:17,737 --> 00:37:20,197
Looks like Sue Dearbon has vanished.

604
00:37:20,656 --> 00:37:23,075
- Again.
- That's on me.

605
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:28,706
She played me, Iris,
like Coltrane's soprano sax.

606
00:37:28,873 --> 00:37:30,333
Ralph, you can't beat yourself up.

607
00:37:30,458 --> 00:37:32,698
I mean, it's not like you knew
who you were dealing with.

608
00:37:32,752 --> 00:37:35,630
I'm supposed to be a master detective.

609
00:37:35,713 --> 00:37:38,549
Ralph, we've all put our trust
in people who have betrayed us.

610
00:37:38,674 --> 00:37:39,759
God knows I have.

611
00:37:40,301 --> 00:37:42,136
I'm gonna go tear down my crime board.

612
00:37:47,058 --> 00:37:49,268
It's gonna take him awhile
to get over this one.

613
00:37:52,021 --> 00:37:55,399
Hey, Joe told me
that you came by C.C.P.D. today.

614
00:37:55,691 --> 00:37:57,485
I think I know why
you didn't come say hi.

615
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:12,833
What happened to it
falling into the wrong hands?

616
00:38:13,417 --> 00:38:15,002
These are the right hands.

617
00:38:16,545 --> 00:38:19,715
Joe and I found evidence
linking Carver's assassins

618
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,840
to more killings,

619
00:38:20,883 --> 00:38:23,094
crimes that C.C.P.D.
thought were accidents.

620
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:27,056
Black Hole is a lot more dangerous
than I even realized.

621
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:31,102
But if you can use this
in your investigation in any way

622
00:38:31,185 --> 00:38:33,229
to bring down Carver
and his people faster,

623
00:38:33,312 --> 00:38:35,940
then that's a good thing.

624
00:38:37,191 --> 00:38:40,236
And while I don't trust the world...

625
00:38:41,988 --> 00:38:44,991
I do trust you with everything.

626
00:38:51,122 --> 00:38:52,164
Thank you.

627
00:39:00,881 --> 00:39:04,593
You have a connection to the mirror
even when it's broken.

628
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:08,472
Now who sounds crazy?

629
00:39:09,557 --> 00:39:12,101
I've seen a lot of strange things
in the last six years.

630
00:39:12,309 --> 00:39:15,062
You being able to control that mirror
is the least of it.

631
00:39:15,479 --> 00:39:17,857
Sam Scudder could even
travel through them.

632
00:39:18,107 --> 00:39:20,401
Well, I'm not a meta-criminal
who jumps through mirrors

633
00:39:20,484 --> 00:39:22,778
- to rob banks.
- I know.

634
00:39:23,988 --> 00:39:25,281
You're much more than that.

635
00:39:25,656 --> 00:39:27,408
We're the only people in this world,
Eva,

636
00:39:27,491 --> 00:39:30,327
so trust me when I say
that you are stronger than you think.

637
00:39:31,579 --> 00:39:32,705
You're a survivor.

638
00:39:34,415 --> 00:39:35,541
Now, prove it.

639
00:39:46,927 --> 00:39:48,512
You did it. Now, keep going.

640
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,718
One thousand, three hundred
and twenty-three.

641
00:40:47,363 --> 00:40:48,697
I'm still with you.

642
00:41:02,044 --> 00:41:03,712
How did I do that?

643
00:41:08,968 --> 00:41:10,094
I don't know.

644
00:41:11,887 --> 00:41:13,806
But I promise you we will figure it out.

645
00:41:55,472 --> 00:41:56,557
Game on.

646
00:41:56,581 --> 00:42:04,581
