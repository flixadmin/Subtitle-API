I wish I hadn't told you.

162
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,200
Then think of marriage
as a beautiful road...

-It's hard to tell these days.

Do you love the woman?

167
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,560
Fucking what?

168
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,320
Well, then go and marry her
like the rest of us.

169
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,840
She doesn't want her family to know.

170
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,480
And she doesn't want to have the baby.

171
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,560
We know a woman.

172
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,240
-Shut up, John.
-Same woman who helped you out, twice.

173
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,880
-They weren't my women.
-Mmm-hmm.

174
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,960
That's why you had them fixed, Arthur.

175

Twenty minutes. Done.

182
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,840
And then this kid walks in, no shoes on,
says, "it's done".

183

shiny new shoes.

-And he shouts, "It's done, Arthur."
-And what?

186
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,960
She bought new shoes

187
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,600
with the money I gave her.

188
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,960
It was for a good cause.

via my own God
for abusing a very holy day

Really?

650
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,160
She did it.

JOHN: (GROANING)
I tell you what.

652
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,080
I tell you what, I swear at one point...

653
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:57,960
At one point, I looked down
at the top of her head

654
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:00,600
and I thought she was going to
pull me cock off in her hand

655
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:02,520
and fucking throw it out of the window.

656
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:06,120
Oh, she sucked me dry, I swear to God.

657
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,040
Like fucking spud water at the end...

658

(CLEARS THROAT)

659
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,920
You're quiet, Arthur, eh?

660
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

661
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:18,800
-Fuck off.
-How was your night, brother?

662
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:21,480
-You got all your buttons back, eh?
-Yeah, all right.

say about it, Arthur, eh?

00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,000
Fuck off, both of ya.

665
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,120
He tells Linda everything.

666
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:33,640
Every single thing.

667
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:36,160
Yeah, well, we'll see...

668
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:44,800
We're going to miss you when
you're gone now, Arthur.

669
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,760

675
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:38,960
Should I get them tea?

676
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,160
Get 'em beer.

677
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,800
They used to run on it
like cars on petrol.

678
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,720
Give them the black country stuff.

679
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,000
It's in the barrel with the tack.

680
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,760
They're going to fucking clean me out.

681
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,360
ARTHUR: Whatever they take,
they'll put back.

682
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:53,640
Good men.

683
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:55,160
John, Arthur.

684
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,240

685
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:02,600
Well, if it ain't the Tipton
Fucking Clay Kickers, eh?

686
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:05,320
-Clay Kickers.
-Come here, you.

687
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,400
-How are ya? Good to see ya.
-How are ya?

-Nice.

From the South African
Native Labour Corps.

691
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:19,000
Sent to Flanders from the
Bloemfontein diamond mines.

692
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:22,120
And the best tunneller I ever met.

693
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:24,400
So, there's three cellars
underneath the house.

694
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,480
Wine, kitchen and septic.

695
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,520
There's a tunnel here that runs

696
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:32,080
from the house underneath the river
to an underground strong room.

697
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,720
Now, this used to be
the palace treasury.

698
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,800
The tunnel runs directly west

699
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,760
and it's separated from
the house by three iron doors

700
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:41,680
with locks we can't open.

701
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,800
We need our tunnel to run from here
and hit the strong room, direct.

00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:35,560
Is Michael still there?

707
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,960
Right, would you tell him
that I have taken the car?

708
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:43,880
He can take the train.

709
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:47,800
And try and find out why
he's been so bloody sour lately.

I never got a chance to fire it.

And the gypsy rules
say it must be passed on...

It's not about rules, Pol.

720
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:44,560
It's about he asked me.

721
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,680
It's about he told me

722
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:50,280
why he wanted to do it.

723
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:52,720
Now, if I tell you,

724

I can't take the knowledge back.

he was with the parish...

Better off without it, Pol.

This is when he was with the Fathers.
