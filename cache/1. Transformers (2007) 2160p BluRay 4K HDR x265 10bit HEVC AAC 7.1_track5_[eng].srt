1
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:57,600
Before time began, there was the Cube.

2
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,228
We know not where it comes from,

3
00:01:00,311 --> 00:01:06,609
only that it holds the power
to create worlds and fill them with life.

4
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:10,196
That is how our race was born.

5
00:01:10,321 --> 00:01:12,740
For a time, we lived in harmony,

6
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:19,455
but like all great power,
some wanted it for good, others for evil.

7
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:22,667
And so began the war,

8
00:01:22,792 --> 00:01:27,838
a war that ravaged our planet
until it was consumed by death,

9
00:01:28,339 --> 00:01:33,052
and the Cube was lost
to the far reaches of space.

10
00:01:33,678 --> 00:01:39,433
We scattered across the galaxy,
hoping to find it and rebuild our home,

11
00:01:39,517 --> 00:01:44,063
searching every star, every world.

12
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:50,528
And just when all hope seemed lost,
message of a new discovery drew us

13
00:01:50,653 --> 00:01:55,074
to an unknown planet called Earth.

14
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:04,375
But we were already too late.

15
00:02:17,847 --> 00:02:19,890
Oh, God, five months of this.

16
00:02:20,016 --> 00:02:22,476
| can't wait to get a little taste of home.

17
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,645
A plate of mama's alligators efouffee.

18
00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:26,897
You've been talking
about barbecued 'gators and crickets

19
00:02:27,023 --> 00:02:30,151
for the last two weeks. I'm never going
to your mama's house, Fig. | promise.

20
00:02:30,234 --> 00:02:33,571
But Bobby, Bobby, 'gators are known
to have the most succulent meat.

21
00:02:33,696 --> 00:02:34,739
| understand.

22
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:40,619
English, please. English.

23
00:02:40,745 --> 00:02:44,415
| mean, how many times have we...
We don't speak Spanish. | told you that.

24
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,751
Why you got to ruin it for me, man?
That's my heritage.

25
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:50,755
Go with the Spanish. Whatever.

26
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:55,885
Hey, you guys remember weekends?
Huh? The Sox at Fenway.

27
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:58,721
-Cold hotdog and a flat beer.
-Perfect day.

28
00:02:59,722 --> 00:03:02,767
What about you, Captain?
You got a perfect day?

29
00:03:03,059 --> 00:03:05,853
| just can't wait to hold my baby girl
for the first time.

30
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:07,355
-He's adorable.
-That's too...

31
00:03:07,438 --> 00:03:08,606
Shut up!

32
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:29,460
Hey, I'm ready to do this.

33
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:32,463
Hey, any of y'all grow some balls,
come see me on the court, man.

34
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:33,672
Hey, hey!

35
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:37,968
Watch this crossover, baby.

36
00:03:38,094 --> 00:03:41,263
Like Jordan in his prime,
pushing through the front line.

37
00:03:42,098 --> 00:03:44,225
-Step aside, ladies.
-Oh, man. What?

38
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:46,602
-Lennox!
-Hey, what are you doing?

39
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:49,313
-Water?
-Thank you.

40
00:03:49,522 --> 00:03:50,981
Are you gonna help me with the gear?

41
00:03:58,114 --> 00:04:02,493
Colonel Sharp, we have an inbound
unidentified infiltrator, 10 miles out.

42
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:11,710
Unidentified aircraft, you are
in restricted US military airspace.

43
00:04:11,836 --> 00:04:14,630
Squawk ident and proceed east
out of the area.

44
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:20,553
Raptors one and two, snap to heading
two-five-zero to intercept.

45
00:04:20,678 --> 00:04:23,514
Bogie is in the weeds ten miles out,
not squawking.

46
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:33,107
Unidentified aircraft, we will escort you
to US SOCCENT airbase.

47
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,360
If you do not comply,
we will use deadly force.

48
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:39,655
Copy the bogie.

49
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:42,324
Tail 4500 X-ray.

50
00:04:42,408 --> 00:04:44,910
Sir, says here 4500 X
was shot down three months ago.

51
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:46,829
-Afghanistan.
-That's got to be a mistake.

52
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:48,998
-Check again, then recheck.
-1 did, sir.

53
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:51,083
A friend of mine was on that chopper.

54
00:04:51,876 --> 00:04:55,713
Unidentified aircraft, we will escort you
to US SOCCENT airbase.

55
00:04:57,882 --> 00:05:01,093
-Radar, where's the inbound?
-Bogie's five miles out, sir.

56
00:05:04,597 --> 00:05:06,390
-My wife on?
-Yes, Captain.

57
00:05:08,726 --> 00:05:10,394
-My ladies!
-Look.

58
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:12,438
Oh, my goodness. Look at her.
She's getting so big.

59
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:15,733
Look at those cheeks.
| just wanna chew on them.

60
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:17,526
Baby, we made a good-looking kid.

61
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,778
| know that people say that all the time,

62
00:05:19,904 --> 00:05:22,239
but, wow, we made
one good-looking kid. Nice work.

63
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:24,116
She has your laugh.

64
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:26,785
-She laughed?
-Her first one, yeah.

65
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:29,830
You sure she didn't just fart?

66
00:05:29,914 --> 00:05:31,749
No, she's a lady.

67
00:05:31,874 --> 00:05:34,376
She doesn't know you yet, but she will.

68
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,756
4500 X. Something's not right.

69
00:05:43,761 --> 00:05:45,471
Bogie's on the deck.

70
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:48,766
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Radar's jammed.

71
00:05:50,226 --> 00:05:52,102
It's coming from the chopper.

72
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:54,772
-Will?
-Sarah?

73
00:05:54,897 --> 00:05:58,734
Hey, Sarah, if you can hear me,
| love you and I'll be home soon.

74
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:04,448
-To the right. Go to the right.
-Check fire.

75
00:06:08,244 --> 00:06:11,497
MH-53 pilot, power down now.

76
00:06:15,334 --> 00:06:17,836
Have your crew step out
or we will kill you.

77
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:29,682
Hold your fire! Stand by to engage!

78
00:06:36,814 --> 00:06:37,982
My God.

79
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:58,210
They bombed the antenna farm!
We're under attack!

80
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:28,407
Go! Move! Move!

81
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:37,082
It's going after the files!

82
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:38,542
Cut the hard lines!

83
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:40,586
| need a key! It's locked!

84
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:44,089
Move! Move!

85
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:51,847
Here, come here! Come here!

86
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:08,906
Here, hide in here!

87
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:11,075
Oh, my God. Okay.

88
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:16,580
Ol

89
00:08:26,465 --> 00:08:28,300
Wil -

90
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:39,061
Epps, let's go!

91
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:01,500
Okay, Mr. Witwicky, you're up.

92
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:04,211
Sorry, | got a lot of stuff.

93
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:05,504
"Y1 elg

94
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:06,755
Okay.

95
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:09,341
For my family...

96
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:13,846
Who did... Who did that?
People! Responsibility.

97
00:09:17,141 --> 00:09:18,267
Okay.

98
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:21,270
So, for my family genealogy report,

99
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:24,481
| decided to do it
on my great-great-grandfather,

100
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:27,818
who was a famous man,
Captain Archibald Witwicky.

101
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:29,319
Very famous explorer.

102
00:09:29,445 --> 00:09:35,868
In fact, he was one of the first to explore
the Arctic Circle, which is a big deal.

103
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:43,167
In 1897, he took 41 brave sailors
straight into the Arctic Shelf.

104
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:48,338
Move faster, men! Move! Chop! Heave!

105
00:09:48,464 --> 00:09:53,844
The ice Is freezing faster than
it's melting! Chop faster! Heave, men!

106
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:58,724
Heave! No sacrifice, no victory!

107
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:01,226
We'll get to the Arctic Circle, lads!

108
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:04,438
So that's the story, right?

109
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,732
And here we have some of
the basic instruments and tools

110
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:08,692
used by 19th-century seamen.

111
00:10:10,027 --> 00:10:11,987
This here is the quadrant,
which you can get for 80 bucks.

112
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,363
It's all for sale, by the way.

113
00:10:13,489 --> 00:10:18,202
Like the sextant here.
$50 for this, which is a bargain.

114
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:20,788
These are pretty cool.
These are my grandfather's glasses.

115
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:23,624
| haven't quite gotten them appraised
yet, but they've seen many cool things.

116
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:25,959
Are you going to sell me his liver?

117
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:28,629
Mr. Witwicky, this isn't show and sell.
It's the 11th grade.

118
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:29,880
| don't think your grandfather would be

119
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,215
particularly proud of what you're doing.

120
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:34,551
| know. I'm sorry. | just, you know,
this is all going towards my car fund.

121
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:36,720
You can tell your folks. It's on eBay.
| take PayPal.

122
00:10:36,804 --> 00:10:38,138
Cold hard cash works, too.

123
00:10:38,222 --> 00:10:40,557
And the compass makes a great gift
for Columbus Day.

124
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:41,975
-Sam!
-Sorry.

125
00:10:42,184 --> 00:10:43,894
Unfortunately,
my great-great-grandfather,

126
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:48,816
the genius that he was, wound up
going blind and crazy in a psycho ward,

127
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,067
drawing these strange symbols

128
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:52,653
and babbling on about
some giant ice man

129
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:54,404
that he thought he'd discovered.

130
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:58,408
Okay. Might be a pop quiz tomorrow.
Might not.

131
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:00,744
-Sleep in fear tonight.
-Here, you want? Here, 50. 40?7 307

132
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:03,247
-Sam?
-Yeah. Sorry, sorry.

133
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,916
Okay. Pretty good, right?

134
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:10,254
I'd say a solid B-.

135
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:12,923
A B-?

136
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:15,092
You were hawking
your great-grandfather's crap

137
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,343
-In my classroom.
-No, kids enjoy...

138
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:17,678
-Look, can you do me a favor?
-What?

139
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:20,097
Can you look out the window
for a second? You see my father?

140
00:11:20,222 --> 00:11:21,765
-He's the guy in the green car.
-Yeah.

141
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,518
Okay, | wanna tell you about a dream.
A boy's dream.

142
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,353
And a man's promise to that boy.

143
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:29,273
He looked at me in the eye.
He said, "Son, I'm gonna buy you a car.

144
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:31,692
"But | want you to bring me $2,000
and three As."

145
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:33,944
Okay? | got the 2,000 and | got two As.

146
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:38,115
Okay? Here's the dream. Your B-.
Dream gone. Kaput.

147
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:42,953
Sir, just ask yourself,
what would Jesus do?

148
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:45,747
Yes! Yes, yes.

149
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:49,543
A-. It's an A, though.

150
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,378
Wait, wait, wait. | can't see. It's an A.

151
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,213
-So I'm good?
-You're good.

152
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:57,217
-| got a little surprise for you, son.
-What kind of...

153
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:59,553
Yeah, a little surprise.

154
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:04,141
No. No, no, no, no. Dad!

155
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:06,643
-Oh, you got to be kidding me.
-See?

156
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:09,646
Yeah. | am.
You're not getting a Porsche.

157
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:15,068
-You think that's funny?
-Yeanh, | think it's funny.

158
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:16,653
-What's wrong with you?
-You think I'd really get you

159
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:19,406
a Porsche for your first car?

160
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,658
| don't want to talk to you
for the rest of this whole thing.

161
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:25,329
-Oh, come on. It's just a practical joke.
-It's not a funny joke.

162
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:29,917
-Manny!
-What?

163
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:32,502
Get your cousin out of
that damn clown suit.

164
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:33,670
He's having a heat stroke again.

165
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:34,922
Scaring white folks.

166
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:37,549
I'm hot! Makeup's melting.
It hurts my eyes.

167
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:40,260
Here? No, no, no, what is this?
You said... You said half a car,

168
00:12:40,344 --> 00:12:41,929
not half a piece of crap, Dad.

169
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:44,431
When | was your age, I'd have been
happy with four wheels and an engine.

170
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:46,016
Okay, let me explain
something to you. Okay?

171
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,434
-You ever see 40-Year-Old Virgin?
-Yeah.

172
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:50,604
Okay, that's what this is.
And this is 50-year-old virgin.

173
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:52,522
-Okay.
-You want me to live that life?

174
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:54,775
-No sacrifice, no victory.
-Yeah, no victory. You know, | got it.

175
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:56,193
-The old Witwicky motto, Dad.
S a{lepd

176
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:57,361
Gentlemen.

177
00:12:58,362 --> 00:13:02,199
Bobby Bolivia, like the country,
except without the runs.

178
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:03,367
How can | help you?

179
00:13:03,492 --> 00:13:06,286
Well, my son here,
looking to buy his first car.

180
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:09,289
-You come to see me?
-l had to.

181
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:13,710
That practically makes us family.
Uncle Bobby B, baby. Uncle Bobby B.

182
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:16,213
-Sam.
-Sam, let me talk to you.

183
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:21,218
Sam, your first enchilada of freedom
awaits underneath one of those hoods.

184
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:25,305
Let me tell you something, son.
A driver don't pick the car.

185
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,307
The car'll pick the driver.

186
00:13:27,391 --> 00:13:30,227
It's a mystical bond
between man and machine.

187
00:13:30,352 --> 00:13:33,230
Son, I'm a lot of things,
but a liar's not one of them.

188
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:37,901
Especially not in front of my mammy.
That's my mammy. Hey, Mammy!

189
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:42,656
Don't be like that.
If | had a rock, I'd bust your head, bitch.

190
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,825
| tell you, man, she deaf, you know?

191
00:13:47,411 --> 00:13:52,416
Well, over here, every piece of car
a man might want or need.

192
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,001
This ain't bad.

193
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:57,337
-This one's got racing stripes.
-Yeah.

194
00:13:57,421 --> 00:13:58,755
It got racing...

195
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:01,258
Yeah, what's this?
What the heck is this?

196
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,093
| don't know nothing about this car.

197
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:04,428
-Manny!
-What?

198
00:14:04,553 --> 00:14:07,180
What is this? This car! Check it out!

199
00:14:07,264 --> 00:14:09,766
| don't know, boss! I've never seen it!
That's loco!

200
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,352
Don't go Ricky Ricardo on me, Manny!
Find out!

201
00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:14,021
Feels good.

202
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,608
-How much?
-Well,

203
00:14:20,444 --> 00:14:23,530
considering the semi-classic nature
of the vehicle,

204
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:25,449
with the slick wheels
and the custom paint job...

205
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:29,619
-Yeah, but the paint's faded.
-Yeah, but it's custom.

206
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:30,787
It's custom faded?

207
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:33,623
Well, this is your first car.
| wouldn't expect you to understand.

208
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:36,543
-Five grand.
-No, I'm not paying over four. Sorry.

209
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:38,545
Kid, come on, get out. Get out the car.

210
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:40,213
No, no, no.
You said cars pick their drivers.

211
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:43,467
Well, sometimes they pick a driver
with a cheap-ass father. Out the car.

212
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:46,803
Now, this one here
for four Gs is a beaut.

213
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:48,972
There's a Fiesta with racing stripes
over there.

214
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:51,725
No, | don't want a Fiesta
with racing stripes.

215
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,810
This is a classic engine right here.

216
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:56,313
| sold a car the other day...

217
00:14:58,315 --> 00:14:59,733
Gee. Holy cow.

218
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,318
-No, no, no. No worries.
-You all right?

219
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:05,155
I'll get a sledgehammer and knock
this right out. Hey, hey, Manny!

220
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:06,907
C11RY/eV ol o Vs WeTe 1N LT gl
and get some hammers

221
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:09,159
and come bang this stuff out, baby!

222
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:11,161
...greater than man...

223
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:14,414
That one's my favorite,
drove all the way from Alabammy.

224
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:32,474
$4,000.

225
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:46,446
Steve.

226
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,448
Hello, Mr. Secretary.

227
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:52,035
They're so young.

228
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:54,287
They're the top
subject matter experts, sir.

229
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:56,623
NSA's recruiting right out of
high school these days.

230
00:15:56,706 --> 00:16:00,127
Guys, that's the Secretary of Defense.

231
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:03,213
| am so underdressed.

232
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:06,341
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Secretary of Defense.

233
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:09,886
Please be seated.

234
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:12,889
I'm John Keller.

235
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:16,226
Obviously, you're wondering
why you're here, so these are the facts.

236
00:16:17,561 --> 00:16:19,563
At 1900 local time yesterday,

237
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:22,858
the SOCCENT Forward Operations
Base in Qatar was attacked.

238
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:26,319
ST R IERRYCR A
there were no survivors.

239
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:30,031
The objective of the attack
was to hack our military network.

240
00:16:30,574 --> 00:16:32,242
We're not sure
exactly what they're after,

241
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:35,745
but we do know that
they were cut off during the assault,

242
00:16:35,871 --> 00:16:39,749
which would lead us to assume
that they're going to try it again.

243
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:43,170
Now, no one's taken responsibility
for the attack.

244
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:47,257
And the only real lead we have so far
is this sound.

245
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,558
RaEEISSR ISR o gF=
that hacked our network.

246
00:16:57,934 --> 00:17:01,104
NSA's working at full capacity
to analyze it

247
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:02,689
and intercept further communications,

248
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:05,609
but we need your help
to find out who did this.

249
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:09,905
Now, you've all shown considerable
ability in the area of signals analysis.

250
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,616
We're on a hair-trigger here, people.

251
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:15,285
The President has dispatched
battle groups

252
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:19,539
to the Arabian Gulf and Yellow Sea.
This is as real as it's ever gonna get.

253
00:17:19,623 --> 00:17:21,291
Now I'm gonna leave you
to your officer-in-charge.

254
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:24,294
You'll break up into teams
and you'll start your work.

255
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:25,962
Good luck to us all.

256
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:38,808
All right, Mojo. | got the car.
Now | need the girl.

257
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:44,397
| need money to take out the girl
is what | need.

258
00:17:44,606 --> 00:17:45,690
Zero bids.

259
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,486
1= 1116 =}

260
00:17:49,611 --> 00:17:51,988
Come on, Mojo.
You want your pain pills?

261
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,325
No. Premature.

262
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:56,743
Good. What's up?

263
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:59,663
Nothing. You know, just driving my car.
Driving my car.

264
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:03,166
It's like clockwork.

265
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,834
All right, | know you get wasted
o a R aEI-R glaleFF

266
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,004
but If you piss in my bed again,
you're sleeping outside. Okay?

267
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:10,423
That's it for today. No more. Crackhead.

268
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:14,678
-Ron, this one is uneven.
-Yeah. Probably.

269
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:15,929
This one is wobbly.

270
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:20,183
-Yeah. I'll take care of that real soon.
-Couldn't we have hired a professional?

271
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:21,351
oY1
-What?

272
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:24,020
| do not like footprints on my grass.

273
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:26,356
-What foot... There's no footprints.
-That's why | built my path.

274
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,108
So why don't you go from my grass
onto my path, okay?

275
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:30,360
-It's family grass, Dad.
-Well, when you own your own grass,

276
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:32,445
-you'll understand.
-This... | can't do it anymore.

277
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:33,697
You're putting girl jewelry
on a boy dog.

278
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,781
Wi\ W4

279
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:37,242
He's got enough self-esteem issues
as a Chihuahua, Mom.

280
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:39,035
That's his bling.

281
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:41,037
| want you home at 11:00!

282
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:42,956
S LR Nglegd
-11:00!

283
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,208
Please, for the love of God, drive safely.

284
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,543
Seat belt on!

285
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:56,553
Wow. You are so cheap.

286
00:18:57,804 --> 00:19:00,682
Well, it's his first car.
Supposed to be like that.

287
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:11,067
At this time, we can't confirm
whether there were any survivors.

288
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:12,569
Oh, my God.

289
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:15,488
Our bases worldwide are, as of now,
El1gD I ®0 WDI= -

290
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:17,741
our highest readiness level.

291
00:19:19,034 --> 00:19:20,744
We're dealing with
a very effective weapons system

292
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:23,246
that we have not come across before.

293
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:26,166
But our prayers are with the families
of the brave men and women...

294
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:28,001
Honey, Daddy's gonna be okay.

295
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:31,671
I've never seen a weapons system
I CRGIEY

296
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:34,507
The thermal shows this weird aura
around the exoskeleton

297
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:37,594
like it's cloaked
by some kind of invisible force field.

298
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:39,929
That's impossible. There's no
such thing as invisible force fields

299
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:42,182
except in, like, comic book stuff, right?

300
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:43,600
-Man, | don't know.
-What is that?

301
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:45,852
My mama, she had the gift, you know?

302
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:48,897
She saw things. | got the gene, too,

303
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:52,901
and that thing that attacked us?
| got a feeling it ain't over.

304
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:55,528
How about you use
those magic voodoo powers

305
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:57,197
and get us the hell out of here, huh?

306
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,618
When | took that picture,
| think it saw me.

307
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:05,622
It looked right at me.

308
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:08,625
All right, we got to get this thing
back to the Pentagon right away.

309
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,126
They got to know what
we're dealing with here.

310
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:11,586
My radio’s fried.

311
00:20:12,087 --> 00:20:14,714
- got no communication with aerial.
-Hey, Mahfouz.

312
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:17,717
-How far do you live from here?
-Not far. Just up that mountain.

313
00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:19,386
-Do they have a phone?
-Yes.

314
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:21,137
RN le ol MRS H eI

315
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:26,893
Dude, are you sure
we're invited to this party?

316
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:30,939
Of course, Miles.
It's a lake. Public property.

317
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:33,817
Oh, my God.

318
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:37,487
Oh, my God, dude, Mikaela's here.
Just don't do anything weird, all right?

319
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,155
-I'm good, right?
-Yeah, you're good.

320
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:40,323
Okay.

321
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:46,913
Hey, guys, check it out.

322
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:48,373
Oh, hi.

323
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:52,585
Hey, bro. That car. It's nice. Hey.

324
00:20:57,674 --> 00:20:59,801
So, what are you guys doing here?

325
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:02,387
We're here to climb this tree.

326
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:04,973
| see that. It looks... It looks fun.

327
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:06,558
-Yeah.
-You know, | thought | recognized you.

328
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:09,644
You tried out for the football team
last year, right?

329
00:21:11,146 --> 00:21:12,480
Let's go call your mom.

330
00:21:12,564 --> 00:21:16,484
Oh, no, no, that... No.
That wasn't like a real tryout.

331
00:21:16,568 --> 00:21:19,320
| was researching a book | was writing.

332
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:20,697
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

333
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,158
Yeah? What's it about?
Sucking at sports?

334
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:28,329
No, it's about the link between
brain damage and football.

335
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:30,665
No, it's a good book.
Your friends'll love it.

336
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:33,918
You know, it's got mazes in it and,
you know, little coloring areas,

337
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:36,588
sections, pop-up pictures.
It's a lot of fun.

338
00:21:37,172 --> 00:21:38,381
That's funny.

339
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:41,176
Okay, okay. You know what? Stop.

340
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:46,264
Hey, guys, | know of a party.
Let's go, let's head.

341
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:48,433
You got to get out
of the tree right now. Get...

342
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:51,144
Just get out of the tree
right now, please.

343
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,271
What are you doing?

344
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:55,440
Did you see that dismount?
All the chicks were watching.

345
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:57,984
You're making me look like an idiot.
We both looked like idiots just now.

346
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:01,362
-Hey, how about you let me drive?
-Oh, no. No, no, no. This is not a toy.

347
00:22:01,446 --> 00:22:04,407
These 22s, | don't want you
grinding them. No.

348
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:07,535
Why doesn't my little bunny
just hop in the back seat?

349
00:22:08,453 --> 00:22:11,873
God, | can't even tell you how much
I'm not your little bunny.

350
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:14,542
Okay.

351
00:22:15,877 --> 00:22:17,378
You'll call me.

352
00:22:23,718 --> 00:22:26,679
Who's gonna drive you home, tonight?

353
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:28,264
Hey, man, what's wrong
with your radio?

354
00:22:28,348 --> 00:22:30,266
-I'm gonna drive her home tonight.
-What?

355
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:33,019
She's an evil jock concubine, man.
Let her hitchhike.

356
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:34,687
She lives 10 miles from here, okay?
It's my only chance.

357
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:36,105
You got to be understanding
here, all right?

358
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:37,607
All right. We'll put her in the back.
I'll be quiet.

359
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,359
-Did you say, "Put her in the back"?
-1 called shotgun.

360
00:22:39,442 --> 00:22:41,194
I'm not putting her in the back.
You got to get out of my car.

361
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:42,695
-That's a party foul.
-What rules?

362
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:43,947
Bros before hos.

363
00:22:44,072 --> 00:22:45,865
Miles, I'm begging you to get out
of my car. Okay?

364
00:22:45,949 --> 00:22:47,033
You can't do this to me.

365
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:48,618
You got to get out of my car right now.

366
00:22:52,956 --> 00:22:56,376
Who's gonna come around
when you break?

367
00:22:56,459 --> 00:22:59,379
Mikaela! It's Sam.

368
00:22:59,462 --> 00:23:00,547
Witwicky.

369
00:23:00,964 --> 00:23:03,049
| hope | didn't get you
stranded or anything.

370
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:04,217
You sure?

371
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,135
So, listen, | was wondering
if | could ride you home.

372
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:09,722
| mean, give you a ride home
in my car, to your house.

373
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:11,933
L EICRY/eiNso}

374
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:26,322
| can't believe that I'm here right now.

375
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:30,410
You can duck down if you want.
| mean, it won't hurt my feelings.

376
00:23:30,493 --> 00:23:32,495
Oh, no, no, no.
| didn't mean here with you.

377
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:37,834
| jJust meant here, like, in this situation,
this same situation that I'm always in.

378
00:23:37,959 --> 00:23:40,920
'Cause, | don't know, | guess I just
have a weakness for hot guys,

379
00:23:41,004 --> 00:23:44,591
for tight abs and really big arms.

380
00:23:45,008 --> 00:23:46,259
Big arms?

381
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:51,014
Well, there's a couple new additions
in the car.

382
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:53,600
Like, | just put in that light there.

383
00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:58,146
And that disco ball. And so the light
reflects off the disco ball.

384
00:24:00,023 --> 00:24:01,107
Yeanh.

385
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:07,614
Are you new to school this year?
It's your first year here?

386
00:24:07,697 --> 00:24:09,616
Oh, no, no.

387
00:24:09,699 --> 00:24:11,618
We've been in the same school
since first grade.

388
00:24:11,701 --> 00:24:12,994
-Really?
-Yeah.

389
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:14,704
Yeah, a long time.

390
00:24:14,829 --> 00:24:16,706
Well, do we have any classes together?

391
00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:18,374
-Yeah, yeah.
-Really? Which?

392
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:21,961
History. Language arts. Math. Science.

393
00:24:22,045 --> 00:24:23,338
Sl
-Sam. Yeah.

394
00:24:23,421 --> 00:24:26,883
-Sam Wilkicky.
RNV

395
00:24:27,008 --> 00:24:28,635
God, you know what? I'm so sorry.
| just...

396
00:24:28,718 --> 00:24:30,428
-No, it's cool.
-| just didn't recognize you.

397
00:24:30,553 --> 00:24:33,014
Yeah, well, | mean,
that's understandable.

398
00:24:34,182 --> 00:24:37,018
No, no, no. No. Come on.

399
00:24:38,353 --> 00:24:40,772
Sorry, I'm just working out the kinks.
You know, it's a new car.

400
00:24:41,731 --> 00:24:44,359
When | get that feeling
| want sexual healing

401
00:24:44,442 --> 00:24:47,195
This radio is, like, you know...
It's an old radio, too, so...

402
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:48,988
Sexual healing

403
00:24:49,072 --> 00:24:51,324
Look, this isn't something that I,
you know...

404
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:54,410
| can't get this radio to stop.
Look, | wouldn't try this on you.

405
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:56,913
'Cause this is like a romantic thing
that I'm not trying to do.

406
00:24:57,038 --> 00:24:58,706
Not that you're not worthy
of trying something like this on.

407
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,124
-No, of course not.
-I'm a friend of yours.

408
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:02,585
I'm not a romantic friend.
Romantic friends do this.

409
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:05,755
| mean, I'm not that friend.
| mean, we... | could be.

410
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,340
| feel good

411
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:08,883
Just pop the hood.

412
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:12,470
Stupid. Shut up, shut up, shut up.

413
00:25:14,931 --> 00:25:16,140
Whoa, nice headers.

414
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:17,809
You've got a high-rise
double-pump carburetor.

415
00:25:17,934 --> 00:25:20,311
That's pretty impressive, Sam.

416
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:21,646
Double-pump?

417
00:25:21,771 --> 00:25:24,482
It squirts the fuel in
SO you can go faster.

418
00:25:26,484 --> 00:25:28,277
| like to go faster.

419
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:32,281
And it looks like
your distributor cap's a little loose.

420
00:25:33,491 --> 00:25:35,243
Yeah? How'd you know that?

421
00:25:36,327 --> 00:25:40,331
My dad. He was a real grease monkey.
He taught me all about this.

422
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:43,876
| could take it all apart, clean it,
put it back together.

423
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,087
BRIl o
| just wouldn't peg you for mechanical.

424
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,296
Oh, my God.

425
00:25:47,422 --> 00:25:48,965
Well, you know,
| don't really broadcast it.

426
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:52,093
Guys don't like it when you know
more about cars than they do.

427
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:54,846
Especially not Trent. He hates it.

428
00:25:54,971 --> 00:25:57,807
Yeah, no, I'm cool with, you know,
females working on my engine.

429
00:25:57,932 --> 00:25:59,475
| prefer it, actually.

430
00:26:00,143 --> 00:26:02,437
-Okay. You want to fire it up for me?
-Oh, yeah, yeah, no problem.

431
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,731
-Thanks.
-You know, | was thinking.

432
00:26:04,814 --> 00:26:08,317
You know, if Trent's such a jerk,
why do you hang out with him?

433
00:26:10,528 --> 00:26:13,156
You know what? I'm just...
I'm gonna walk.

434
00:26:13,281 --> 00:26:14,949
Good luck with your car.

435
00:26:17,285 --> 00:26:18,369
All right.

436
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:20,455
Walking's healthy, right?

437
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:23,833
Oh, God, no, no, no, no, no, no.

438
00:26:24,167 --> 00:26:26,461
Come on, please.
Please, you gotta work for me now.

439
00:26:26,544 --> 00:26:29,380
Don't let her walk away. Come on,
come on, come on. Please, please.

440
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:34,010
Baby come back
any kind of fool could see

441
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:40,391
There was something
in everything about you

442
00:26:42,018 --> 00:26:44,562
Baby come back
you can blame it all on me

443
00:26:48,566 --> 00:26:50,318
Wait a second!

444
00:26:50,401 --> 00:26:53,905
| was wrong
and | just can't live without you

445
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:57,074
There it is.

446
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:01,579
| had fun.
So, you know, thanks for listening.

447
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:06,334
-Oh, yeah, yeah.
-You... You think I'm shallow?

448
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:10,588
| think you're... No, no, no. | think...

449
00:27:11,047 --> 00:27:15,343
| think there's a lot more
than meets the eye with you.

450
00:27:17,261 --> 00:27:18,387
Okay.

451
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:20,223
Yeanh.

452
00:27:20,348 --> 00:27:22,850
All right, I'll see you at school.

453
00:27:22,934 --> 00:27:24,060
All right.

454
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:31,400
That's stupid.

455
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:32,735
That was a stupid line.

456
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:35,696
"There's a lot more than meets
the eye with you." Stupid.

457
00:27:38,074 --> 00:27:39,408
Oh, God.

458
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:42,411
Oh, my God. | love my car.

459
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:58,970
Hey, guys, | think the other team
figured it out. Iran.

460
00:27:59,095 --> 00:28:02,765
Come on, man. This is way too smart
for Iranian scientists.

461
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:06,602
-Think about it.
-What do you think, kid? Chinese?

462
00:28:07,103 --> 00:28:09,313
No way. This is nothing like
what the Chinese are using.

463
00:28:12,942 --> 00:28:14,819
This is Air Force One.
Level of flight, level three-three-zero.

464
00:28:14,944 --> 00:28:16,988
We will hunt down this enemy.
And when we do,

465
00:28:17,113 --> 00:28:19,282
we'll know just what to do with them.

466
00:28:19,782 --> 00:28:21,993
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

467
00:28:38,801 --> 00:28:40,428
Apparently, there are
very few survivors.

468
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:41,721
Yes, Mr. President?

469
00:28:41,804 --> 00:28:44,807
Yeah, can you wrangle me up
some Ding Dongs, darling?

470
00:28:56,861 --> 00:29:00,990
| joined the Air Force to bring the man
Ding Dongs. I'll be in storage.

471
00:29:26,349 --> 00:29:27,516
Shoot.

472
00:29:41,447 --> 00:29:43,032
Gross.

473
00:30:10,226 --> 00:30:11,894
Do you hear that?

474
00:30:14,814 --> 00:30:16,399
Are you getting this?

475
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,068
| think they're hacking
the network again.

476
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:37,420
Oh, my God. This is a direct match
to the signal in Qatar.

477
00:30:37,503 --> 00:30:39,338
-Are you running a diagnostic?
-Should | be?

478
00:30:39,422 --> 00:30:41,424
-Yes, you should.
-So |l am.

479
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:54,854
Someone!
They're hacking into Air Force One!

480
00:30:54,937 --> 00:30:56,480
We need a senior analyst.

481
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:58,441
-1 think they're planting a virus.
-A virus?

482
00:30:58,524 --> 00:31:01,110
-It's streaming right now.
-They are planting a virus

483
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:04,405
and stealing a whole lot of data
from your system at the same time.

484
00:31:04,488 --> 00:31:06,032
Code Red. We have a breach.

485
00:31:06,115 --> 00:31:08,868
Air Force One, someone onboard
has breached the military network.

486
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:11,787
I'm in the cargo hold. Clear. Clear.

487
00:31:16,292 --> 00:31:17,752
-You got to cut the hard lines.
YV oP-\ 4

488
00:31:17,835 --> 00:31:20,963
-Whatever they want, they are getting it.
w4

489
00:31:21,047 --> 00:31:23,799
Permission to take down
the Defense Network.

490
00:31:23,883 --> 00:31:27,887
-Cut all server hard lines now.
-Cut all server hard lines now.

491
00:31:49,492 --> 00:31:52,328
Someone's tampered
with the POTUS mainframe.

492
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:53,871
Wil -

493
00:31:59,335 --> 00:32:01,754
Shots fired in the underdeck.
Repeat, shots fired.

494
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:04,673
Crew, prepare for emergency descent.

495
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:24,777
| want our President in that bunker.

496
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:28,906
And | don't want to discuss a damn
thing other till that becomes reality.

497
00:32:29,031 --> 00:32:32,118
That's our first priority.
That's our only priority right now.

498
00:32:32,201 --> 00:32:33,369
Air Force One is on the ground.

499
00:33:37,433 --> 00:33:40,102
Oh, God. No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

500
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:42,479
That's my car!

501
00:33:47,401 --> 00:33:48,485
No, no, no, no.

502
00:33:55,993 --> 00:33:58,120
Dad, call the cops!

503
00:33:59,914 --> 00:34:03,042
Where you going with my car, buddy?
Where you going?

504
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:06,879
Hello? 911 emergency!
My car has been stolen!

505
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:10,466
I'm in pursuit! Right?
| need all units, the whole squadron.

506
00:34:10,591 --> 00:34:13,344
Bring everyone!
No, don't ask me questions, all right?

507
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:16,138
My father's the head
of the neighborhood watch!

508
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:50,339
Oh, my God.

509
00:35:06,689 --> 00:35:08,148
My name is Sam Witwicky.

510
00:35:08,232 --> 00:35:12,194
Whoever finds this, my car is alive,
okay? You saw that?

511
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:15,030
Since this is my last words on Earth,
| just wanna say, Mom, Dad, | love you,

512
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:17,491
and if you find Busty Beauties
under my bed, it wasn't mine.

513
00:35:17,574 --> 00:35:19,576
I'm holding it for Miles.
No, no, wait that...

514
00:35:19,702 --> 00:35:22,371
Okay, that's not true. It's mine
and Uncle Charles gave it to me.

515
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:24,456
I'm sorry. Mojo, | love you.

516
00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:38,220
No! No! No! No!

517
00:35:41,724 --> 00:35:43,142
Oh, my God.

518
00:35:43,684 --> 00:35:46,228
No, you're a good dog!
Good dog! Good dog!

519
00:35:46,395 --> 00:35:47,563
Oh, my God.

520
00:35:50,816 --> 00:35:55,571
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey! All right! Oh!
No! No!

521
00:35:58,407 --> 00:35:59,825
Okay. Please, please don't kill me!

522
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:03,245
I'm sorry! Take the keys!
| don't want them! Car's yours!

523
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:07,499
Listen, listen, listen.

524
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:08,917
-Good, you're here.
-Let me see your hands!

525
00:36:09,043 --> 00:36:10,586
-No, no, no! It's not me!
-Let me see your hands.

526
00:36:10,711 --> 00:36:13,756
-The guy's inside.
-Shut up! Walk towards the car.

527
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:17,426
Put your head on the hood.

528
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:33,442
Whoever did this finally managed
to infiltrate our defense network,

529
00:36:33,567 --> 00:36:36,111
which is what they tried to do in Qatar,
only this time it worked.

530
00:36:36,195 --> 00:36:37,863
-What did they get?
-We still don't know.

531
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:41,033
-Talk to me about the virus.
-It's a Spider-bot virus.

532
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:43,786
We're not sure what it's going to do,
but it may cripple the system.

533
00:36:43,911 --> 00:36:45,871
-Can we stop it?
-Every time we try an antivirus,

534
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:48,540
it adapts and speeds up.
It's like it's not a virus anymore.

535
00:36:48,624 --> 00:36:49,708
It's become the system.

536
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:52,961
Obviously the first phase
of a major attack against the US.

537
00:36:53,087 --> 00:36:54,713
The only countries
with this kind of capability

538
00:36:54,797 --> 00:36:57,049
are Russia, North Korea, maybe China.

539
00:36:57,132 --> 00:37:00,135
-I'm sorry, that's not correct.
-Excuse me, young lady.

540
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:02,471
| didn't see you standing there.
You would be who?

541
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:04,390
I'm just the analyst
who detected the hack.

542
00:37:04,473 --> 00:37:07,643
Hold on. It was you? You did it?

543
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:10,729
-Her team.
-Sir, | was just trying to say,

544
00:37:10,813 --> 00:37:13,482
they hacked your firewall in 10 seconds.

545
00:37:13,607 --> 00:37:16,235
Okay. Even a supercomputer
with a brute force attack

546
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:18,070
would take 20 years to do that.

547
00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:20,656
Maybe you can explain, then,
how our latest satellite imagery

548
00:37:20,781 --> 00:37:23,075
shows North Korea
doubling its naval activity.

549
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:26,745
Maybe it's a precaution,
because isn't that what we're doing?

550
00:37:26,829 --> 00:37:30,165
The signal pattern is learning.
It's evolving on its own.

551
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:32,584
And you need to
move past Fourier transfers

552
00:37:32,668 --> 00:37:34,837
and start considering
quantum mechanics.

553
00:37:34,962 --> 00:37:37,256
There is nothing on Earth that complex.

554
00:37:37,339 --> 00:37:39,925
What about an organism?
A living organism?

555
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:42,428
Maybe some kind of
DNA-based computer?

556
00:37:42,511 --> 00:37:46,181
-And | know that that sounds crazy...
-That's enough. That's enough.

557
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:49,184
We have six floors of analysts
working on this thing.

558
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:51,603
Now, if you can find proof to back up
your theory,

559
00:37:51,687 --> 00:37:54,273
I'm gonna be happy to listen to you.
But if you don't get a filter

560
00:37:54,356 --> 00:37:58,277
on that brain-mouth thing, you're gonna
be off the team. You understand?

561
00:38:03,699 --> 00:38:07,202
Look, | can't be any clearer
than how crystal clear | am being.

562
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:10,456
-It just stood up.
-It just stood up.

563
00:38:11,957 --> 00:38:13,709
Wow. That's really neat.

564
00:38:14,668 --> 00:38:15,961
Okay, chiefie.

565
00:38:16,295 --> 00:38:19,131
Time to fill her up. And no drippy-drippy.

566
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:20,966
What are you rolling?

567
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:23,469
Whippets? Goofballs?
A little wowie sauce with the boys?

568
00:38:23,552 --> 00:38:25,888
-No, I'm not on any drugs.
-What's these?

569
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,516
Found it in your pocket. "Mojo."

570
00:38:30,726 --> 00:38:33,395
Is that what the kids are doing now?
Little bit of Mojo?

571
00:38:33,479 --> 00:38:37,149
-Those are my dog's pain pills.
-You know, a Chihuahua. A little...

572
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:42,362
What was that?

573
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:47,201
You eyeballing my piece, 50 Cent?

574
00:38:48,327 --> 00:38:51,830
You wanna go?
Make something happen. Do it.

575
00:38:51,914 --> 00:38:55,167
'‘Cause | promise you | will bust you up.

576
00:38:56,502 --> 00:38:57,711
Are you on drugs?

577
00:39:06,345 --> 00:39:08,597
Let's hope this telephone line works.

578
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:13,602
Hey, heads up!

579
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:17,356
Heads up! Hey! Heads up!

580
00:39:22,236 --> 00:39:24,238
\What the heck was that?

581
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:31,245
English, dude. English.

582
00:39:37,626 --> 00:39:38,794
Whoal!

583
00:39:39,419 --> 00:39:40,963
\Watch out!

584
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:49,721
-Open fire!
-Contact! Contact!

585
00:39:49,805 --> 00:39:50,889
Everybody, quiet. Settle.

586
00:39:50,973 --> 00:39:53,100
Whoa, mother... What the hell is...

587
00:40:00,816 --> 00:40:03,610
Get up! Get up! Come on!

588
00:40:10,701 --> 00:40:12,536
Go! Move it!

589
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:26,925
Take cover!

590
00:40:29,261 --> 00:40:31,305
Fig! Cover the rear!

591
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:36,852
Cover fire! Move it! Fig, cover the rear!
Epps! Cover the rear! Move it!

592
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:39,980
Come on! Give me a mag!

593
00:40:41,189 --> 00:40:42,816
Where's your papa?
Where's your papa?

594
00:40:42,899 --> 00:40:44,026
e-lel2

595
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:46,903
Sir, we need... | need a telephone.

596
00:40:46,987 --> 00:40:49,364
-Telephone, telephone, yes!
-Telephone!

597
00:40:49,448 --> 00:40:51,074
Hey, | need a mag! Give me a mag!

598
00:40:51,158 --> 00:40:52,451
-Cell phone!
-| don't know how to thank you.

599
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:53,619
Firel

600
00:40:54,703 --> 00:40:57,289
This is an emergency Pentagon call!
| need you to... Do you understand?

601
00:40:57,372 --> 00:40:59,916
It's an emergency Pentagon...

602
00:41:01,752 --> 00:41:03,920
| don't have a credit card!

603
00:41:04,338 --> 00:41:08,133
Sir, the attitude is not going to speed
things up any bit at all.

604
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:10,927
I'm going to ask you to speak
into the mouthpiece very clearly.

605
00:41:11,011 --> 00:41:15,307
I'm in the middle of a war!
This is frigging ridiculous!

606
00:41:16,642 --> 00:41:17,976

Hey, man, save my game.

How classified?

00:46:32,082 --> 00:46:36,169
Like "l will go to jail for the rest of
my life for showing you" classified.

681
00:46:36,419 --> 00:46:38,421
Yes! One quick peek.

682

-Well, the imager was damaged, sir.

The rangers are en route
with the imager,

685

but we also have a security issue.

of the network intrusion signal.

688
00:46:55,814 --> 00:46:59,150
The signal strength is through the roof.
Where did you say you got this?

689
00:46:59,234 --> 00:47:01,569
It hacked the national military

-No way.
-Yeah.

692
00:47:06,992 --> 00:47:11,413
Looks like there's a message embedded
in the signal. Let me work my magic.

Stop with the barking, Mojo.
It's too early. Please?

00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:08,960
We're gonna die!

762
00:52:14,966 --> 00:52:16,384
Oh, my God!

763
00:52:33,735 --> 00:52:34,902
We're locked in.

764
00:52:37,405 --> 00:52:40,867
The car won't start.
At least we ditched the monster, right?

765
00:52:46,748 --> 00:52:47,874
Okay.

766
00:52:49,417 --> 00:52:50,918
Time to start.

767
00:53:55,233 --> 00:53:56,567
He's got me! Oh, God!

768
00:54:03,074 --> 00:54:04,992
He's going to kill me!

769
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:09,789
No. No, no, no!

770
00:54:24,345 --> 00:54:25,513
Get offl

Get it, get it, get it, get it!

773
00:54:49,704 --> 00:54:51,706
Not so tough without a head, are you?

774
00:54:57,670 --> 00:54:59,130
Here, come on.

776
00:55:16,772 --> 00:55:18,232
It's a robot.

777
00:55:19,609 --> 00:55:20,943
But like a...

778
00:55:21,068 --> 00:55:24,572
Like a different...
You know, like a super-advanced robot.

779
00:55:25,907 --> 00:55:27,366
It's probably Japanese.

780
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:29,911
Yeah, it's definitely Japanese.

781
00:55:31,454 --> 00:55:33,247
What are you doing?

782
00:55:33,789 --> 00:55:37,001
| don't think it wants to hurt us.
It would have done that already.

783
00:55:37,084 --> 00:55:39,378
Really? Well, do you speak robot?

784
00:55:39,462 --> 00:55:42,924
Because they just had, like,
a giant droid death match.

785
00:55:44,258 --> 00:55:47,428
-I think it wants something from me.
-What?

786
00:55:47,553 --> 00:55:50,097
Well, 'cause the other one was
talking about my eBay page.

787
00:55:50,932 --> 00:55:53,726
You are the strangest boy
| have ever met.

788
00:55:54,143 --> 00:55:56,354
-Can you talk?
XM Satellite Radio...

789
00:55:56,437 --> 00:56:00,024
Digital cable brings you...
...Columbia Broadcasting System...

790
00:56:00,107 --> 00:56:01,901
So you... You talk through the radio?

791
00:56:01,984 --> 00:56:04,904
Thank you, you're beautiful.
You're wonderful, you're wonderful.

792
00:56:04,987 --> 00:56:06,989
S0, what was that last night?
What was that?

793
00:56:07,114 --> 00:56:08,574
Message from Starfleet, Captain...

Throughout the inanimate vastness
oI oL lel- 38

00:56:10,826 --> 00:56:12,787
Angels will rain down
like visitors from heaven! Hallelujah!

796
00:56:12,912 --> 00:56:15,039
Visitors from heaven? \What. ..

797
00:56:15,122 --> 00:56:17,291
What are you,
like, an alien or something?

798
00:56:23,089 --> 00:56:25,633
Anymore questions you want to ask?

799
00:56:26,259 --> 00:56:28,469
He wants us to get in the car.

800
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:30,972
And go where?

801
00:56:31,931 --> 00:56:33,683
Fifty years from now,
when you're looking back at your life,

802
00:56:33,808 --> 00:56:36,936
don't you want to be able to say
you had the guts to get in the car?

803
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:08,092
This car's a pretty good driver.

804
00:57:08,175 --> 00:57:09,343
| know.

805
00:57:12,013 --> 00:57:14,015
Why don't you go sit in that seat, there?

806
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:16,309
I'm not going to sit in that seat.
He's driving.

807
00:57:16,392 --> 00:57:17,518
Yeanh.

808
00:57:18,853 --> 00:57:20,354
You're right.

809
00:57:21,856 --> 00:57:24,859
-Well, maybe you should sit in my lap.
AW 0%

810
00:57:26,027 --> 00:57:29,864
Well, | have the only seat belt here.
You know, safety first.

-Yeah.
-Okay.

813
00:57:37,371 --> 00:57:39,415
There, see? That's better.

814
00:57:39,707 --> 00:57:41,167
-Okay.
-Okay.

815
00:57:44,837 --> 00:57:48,215
You know, that seat belt thing was
a pretty smooth move.

816
00:57:49,216 --> 00:57:50,343
Thank you.

817
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:53,429
You know what | don't understand?

818
00:57:53,554 --> 00:57:56,599
Why, if he's supposed to be, like,
this super-advanced robot,

819
00:57:56,724 --> 00:57:59,352
does he transform back
into this piece-of-crap Camaro?

820
00:58:00,728 --> 00:58:02,063
Whoa! Whoal!

821
00:58:02,188 --> 00:58:04,899
Oh, see? No. Get...
No, that doesn't work. See?

822
00:58:05,024 --> 00:58:06,067
Move it, you moron!

823
00:58:06,192 --> 00:58:08,235
Great, now... See?

825
00:58:10,863 --> 00:58:12,740
Now you pissed him off.

826
00:58:13,032 --> 00:58:14,492
That car is sensitive.

827
00:58:14,575 --> 00:58:16,786
| mean, $4000 just drove off.

828

Oh, my God!

831
00:59:50,421 --> 00:59:52,173
Come on, let's go.

832
00:59:57,011 --> 01:00:00,264
This is the coolest thing I've ever seen!
Explosions everywhere!

833
01:00:00,347 --> 01:00:03,851
This is easily a hundred times cooler
than Armageddon. | swear to God!

834
01:00:03,934 --> 01:00:06,187
Fire, fire, fire, fire!

835
01:00:20,117 --> 01:00:21,786
Whoa! Sweet!

836
01:00:21,869 --> 01:00:23,996
Oh, dude, | hope this guy's got
asteroid insurance,

837
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:25,372
'cause he Is so boned!

838
01:00:29,251 --> 01:00:30,628
What is that?

839
01:00:31,128 --> 01:00:32,755
There's something in the tree, dude.

840
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,965
No, there's something
in the thing by the tree!

841
01:00:35,049 --> 01:00:36,425
Could you guys just give me
a space rock?

842
01:01:11,794 --> 01:01:14,338
Excuse me, are you the tooth fairy?

843
01:01:15,589 --> 01:01:18,926
Hey, sweetheart, what are you doing
out here by yourself?

844
01:01:19,009 --> 01:01:21,512
Holy God! What happened to the pool?

845
01:02:54,021 --> 01:02:58,275
Are you Samuel James Witwicky,
descendent of Archibald Witwicky?

846
01:02:59,401 --> 01:03:01,195
They know your name.

847
01:03:02,029 --> 01:03:03,113
Yeanh.

848
01:03:03,197 --> 01:03:05,616
My name is Optimus Prime.

849
01:03:05,699 --> 01:03:09,787
We are autonomous robotic organisms
from the planet Cybertron.

850
01:03:09,870 --> 01:03:13,290
-But you can call us Autobots for short.
-Autobots.

851
01:03:13,457 --> 01:03:18,754
-What's cracking, little bitches?
-My first lieutenant. Designation, Jazz.

852
01:03:18,879 --> 01:03:22,383
This looks like a cool place to kick it.

853
01:03:22,925 --> 01:03:24,802
What is that?
How did he learn to talk like that?

854
01:03:24,885 --> 01:03:28,555
We've learned Earth's languages
through the World Wide Web.

855
01:03:29,974 --> 01:03:32,476
My weapons specialist, Ironhide.

856
01:03:33,394 --> 01:03:36,981
-You feeling lucky, punk?
-Easy, Ironhide.

857
01:03:37,064 --> 01:03:40,317
Just kidding.
| just wanted to show him my cannons.

858
01:03:41,485 --> 01:03:43,696
Our medical officer, Ratchet.

859
01:03:43,779 --> 01:03:47,950
The boy's pheromone level suggests
he wants to mate with the female.

860
01:03:50,327 --> 01:03:53,664
You already know
your guardian, Bumblebee.

861
01:03:53,914 --> 01:03:55,582
Bumblebee, right?

862
01:03:55,666 --> 01:03:57,376
Check on the rep
Yep, second to none

863
01:03:57,459 --> 01:03:59,837
So you're my guardian, huh?

864
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:05,175
His vocal processors were damaged
in battle. I'm still working on them.

865
01:04:09,972 --> 01:04:11,348
Why are you here?

866
01:04:11,432 --> 01:04:16,687
We are here looking for the All Spark.
And we must find it before Megatron.

867
01:04:16,979 --> 01:04:18,480
Mega-what?

868
01:04:27,990 --> 01:04:33,662
Our planet was once a powerful empire,
peaceful and just,

869
01:04:34,663 --> 01:04:39,543
until we were betrayed by Megatron,
leader of the Decepticons.

870
01:04:40,627 --> 01:04:43,922
All who defied them were destroyed.

871
01:04:44,006 --> 01:04:50,137
Our war finally consumed the planet,
and the All Spark was lost to the stars.

872
01:04:51,055 --> 01:04:57,144
Megatron followed it to Earth,
where Captain Witwicky found him.

873
01:04:58,228 --> 01:04:59,980
My grandfather.

874
01:05:00,064 --> 01:05:04,318
It was an accident
that intertwined our fates.

875
01:05:07,488 --> 01:05:09,031
Come back!

876
01:05:11,533 --> 01:05:14,161
| think the dogs have found something.

877
01:05:15,204 --> 01:05:16,997
The ice is cracking!

878
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:29,384
Captain! Grab my rope, Captain!

879
01:05:30,094 --> 01:05:32,179
I'm all right, lads!

880
01:05:33,263 --> 01:05:35,933
Can we throw you a rope, Captain?

881
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:48,403
|leEligo g Nele= B =Tglo=To
before he could retrieve the Cube.

882
01:05:51,949 --> 01:05:55,452
Men! We've made a discovery!

883
01:05:55,536 --> 01:05:59,957
He accidentally activated
his navigation system.

884
01:06:13,554 --> 01:06:19,393
The coordinates to the Cube's location
on Earth were imprinted on his glasses.

885
01:06:19,476 --> 01:06:21,520
How'd you know about his glasses?

886
01:06:21,603 --> 01:06:23,856
==\
=122

887
01:06:23,939 --> 01:06:27,109
If the Decepticons find the All Spark,

888
01:06:27,234 --> 01:06:33,073
they will use its power to transform
Earth's machines and build a new army.

889
01:06:33,157 --> 01:06:36,577
And the human race
will be extinguished.

890
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:42,124
Sam Witwicky,
you hold the key to Earth's survival.

891
01:06:45,294 --> 01:06:48,172
Please tell me
that you have those glasses.

892
01:06:52,259 --> 01:06:55,679
LG
a self-regenerating molecular armor.

893
01:06:55,762 --> 01:06:57,806
Look at the scorch mark
where the sabot round hit.

894
01:06:57,931 --> 01:06:59,141
Melted right through.

895
01:06:59,266 --> 01:07:02,477
Hey, aren't sabots hot-loaded for, like,
a 6,000-degree magnesium burn?

896
01:07:02,603 --> 01:07:04,813
Close to it. It melts tank armor.

897
01:07:04,938 --> 01:07:07,107
So this metal skin must react
to extreme heat.

898
01:07:07,441 --> 01:07:09,484
-Heads up!
Qs

899
01:07:10,194 --> 01:07:12,946
| thought you said
that thing was dead, man!

900
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:17,034
Strap it down! Strap it!
This thing is wicked.

901
01:07:17,117 --> 01:07:18,493
All right, get on the horn
with Northern Command.

902
01:07:18,619 --> 01:07:20,829
Tell them that our effective weapon
is high-heat sabot rounds.

903
01:07:20,954 --> 01:07:22,623
Recommend we load them
on all the gunships. Go.

904
01:07:27,628 --> 01:07:29,338
You want that piece?

905
01:07:29,463 --> 01:07:32,758
Okay, Maggie, look. Let me break
it down to you how it's gonna happen.

906
01:07:32,841 --> 01:07:34,927
They gonna come through that door
and be good cop, bad cop.

907
01:07:35,010 --> 01:07:38,347
Don't fall for that, all right?
That's why | ate their food.

908
01:07:38,472 --> 01:07:41,016
See, they put the plate of donuts
out here to test your guilt.

909
01:07:41,141 --> 01:07:43,602
If you don't touch it, you're guilty.

910
01:07:43,685 --> 01:07:47,522
| ate the whole plate.
The whole plate. Okay?

911
01:07:47,648 --> 01:07:48,815
It's me and you.

912
01:07:48,899 --> 01:07:51,735
They walk through that door,
you don't say nothing.

913
01:08:05,749 --> 01:08:08,835
She did it! She did it!
She's the one you want! All right?

914
01:08:08,919 --> 01:08:10,545
| was just sitting at home
watching cartoons,

915
01:08:10,671 --> 01:08:12,547
playing video games with my cousin,
and she came in there.

916
01:08:12,673 --> 01:08:13,757

-Glen, you freak.

01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:16,051
Hey! | am not going to jail for you
or anybody else!

918
01:08:16,176 --> 01:08:20,764
| have done nothing bad my entire life!
Hey, man, I'm still a virgin.

919
01:08:20,847 --> 01:08:21,932
Okay, so what?

920
01:08:22,015 --> 01:08:24,142
I've downloaded a couple of
thousand songs off the Internet.

921
01:08:24,226 --> 01:08:25,936
Who hasn't? Who hasn't?

922
01:08:26,019 --> 01:08:27,104
-l promise!
-Glen, shut up!

923
01:08:27,187 --> 01:08:31,024
No, you shut up! Don't talk to me!
Don't talk to me, criminal!

924
01:08:33,193 --> 01:08:35,362
-Oh, sugar rush.
-This is... This is not his fault.

925
01:08:35,487 --> 01:08:37,030
See? So can | go home now?

926
01:08:37,155 --> 01:08:39,366
-Oh, okay. | won't.
-But just listen to me.

927
01:08:39,491 --> 01:08:43,203
Okay, whoever hacked into your military
system downloaded a file, all right?

928
01:08:43,328 --> 01:08:45,622
It was something about
someone named Witwicky

929
01:08:45,706 --> 01:08:49,334
and some government group, right?
Named Sector Seven.

930
01:08:49,418 --> 01:08:51,169
You have to let me talk to
Defense Secretary Keller

931
01:08:51,253 --> 01:08:53,547
before you go to war
with the wrong country!

932
01:08:53,672 --> 01:08:56,508
Whatever fell out of the sky
ended up right behind...

933
01:08:56,591 --> 01:08:58,218
-What did he say?
YV oP-\ 4

934
01:08:58,343 --> 01:08:59,761
-Did he hear it, too?
-Yeah, Jack heard it, too. Yeah.

935
01:08:59,886 --> 01:09:02,431
-What does he think it is?
-He thinks it's a military experiment.

936
01:09:02,556 --> 01:09:03,932
-What a knucklehead.
-Yeah, well, | think it's a plane.

937
01:09:09,271 --> 01:09:11,148
Still no official word as to
what happened. You can see...

938
01:09:11,231 --> 01:09:12,441
-Yeah!
o110k

939
01:09:12,566 --> 01:09:14,109
-Yeah. Why?
-He should be home in 15 minutes.

940
01:09:14,234 --> 01:09:15,527
Well, I'll call him in 15 minutes.

941
01:09:15,610 --> 01:09:18,155
If you wait 15 minutes, he'll be late
and you'll have to ground him.

942
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:19,906
Well, | can't ground him
if he's not late, can |?

943
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:26,580
| need you to stay here, all right?

944
01:09:26,705 --> 01:09:27,748
You got to stay here
and you're gonna watch them.

945
01:09:27,873 --> 01:09:28,915
-Okay, okay.
-All of them.

946
01:09:29,041 --> 01:09:30,042
-Do you hear what I'm saying?
-Yeah, okay, okay.

947
01:09:30,125 --> 01:09:31,251
R alla V A= 1IN e | gl g

948
01:09:31,752 --> 01:09:34,755
-Thanks for staying on my path.
-Oh, yeah. No, no, Dad. Hey!

949
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:36,840
The... Oh, the path. I'm sorry.
| forgot about the path.

950
01:09:36,923 --> 01:09:38,592
I'm gonna sweep the whole thing
right now. How about that?

951
01:09:38,717 --> 01:09:40,969
-You know, | buy half your car...
-Yeah.

952
01:09:41,094 --> 01:09:44,765
...then I balil you out of jail and then
| just decided to do all your chores.

953
01:09:44,890 --> 01:09:46,433
-The chores.
-Yeah. Life is great, huh?

954
01:09:46,558 --> 01:09:49,394
Life... Life is fantastic, is how good it is.

955
01:09:49,478 --> 01:09:52,064
It's so... Oh, the trash cans. Sorry, Dad.
I'm gonna do the trash cans now.

956
01:09:52,147 --> 01:09:53,273
No, no, | don't want you
to strain yourself.

957
01:09:53,398 --> 01:09:54,816
No, no, | won't strain myself, Dad.

958
01:09:54,941 --> 01:09:56,401
-l do it.
-It would hurt my feelings if you do it.

959
01:09:56,485 --> 01:09:57,861
-You sure? | don't mind, | don't...
-l promise...

960
01:09:57,944 --> 01:09:59,196
No, no, no, I'm gonna do it.

961
01:09:59,279 --> 01:10:01,198
I'm gonna do the trash cans
and I'm gonna scrape the grill

962
01:10:01,281 --> 01:10:05,160
and I'm gonna... I'm gonna sweep up
the whole house right now.

963
01:10:05,285 --> 01:10:07,621
-Tonight, right now?
-Right now.

964
01:10:10,624 --> 01:10:13,126
| love you. God, | love you

965
01:10:13,251 --> 01:10:14,961
just so much right now.

966
01:10:15,087 --> 01:10:16,505
You know,
Mom wanted me to ground you.

967
01:10:16,630 --> 01:10:18,131
-You're three minutes late.
el ¢4

968
01:10:18,256 --> 01:10:20,092
Oh, well, just another thing
you did for me, Dad,

969
01:10:20,175 --> 01:10:21,551
because you're such a swell guy.

970
01:10:21,635 --> 01:10:22,803
One more thing, huh?

971
01:10:22,928 --> 01:10:25,972
All right, | love you!
Sleep good, handsome man!

972
01:10:26,973 --> 01:10:28,141
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

973
01:10:28,308 --> 01:10:31,561
No, watch the path! Watch the path!
Watch the... Please, please, please.

974
01:10:31,645 --> 01:10:34,523
No, no, wait. No, no, no! Oh, no!

975
01:10:34,648 --> 01:10:37,067
-Sorry. My bad.
-Oh, I... You couldn't...

976
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:39,152
You couldn't wait for five...
You couldn't wait for five minutes?

977
01:10:39,277 --> 01:10:42,114
| told you to just stay! Just stay! God!

978
01:10:45,325 --> 01:10:47,327
-| told you to watch them. | told you.
-Okay, you know what?

979
01:10:47,452 --> 01:10:51,498
-They seem to be in a little bit of a rush.
-Oh, this is bad. No!

980
01:10:52,707 --> 01:10:55,168
Mojo, Mojo! Off the robot! God!

981
01:10:55,669 --> 01:10:58,255
-Oh, wet.
-No, no, no, no, no! Easy! Easy!

982
01:10:58,338 --> 01:11:01,133
Hold on! Hold! This is Mojo.
This is Mojo. He's a pet of mine.

983
01:11:01,216 --> 01:11:04,010
He's a pet. Okay? That's all.
If you could just put the guns away...

984
01:11:04,136 --> 01:11:07,097
-Put the... Put them away. Please.
-You have a rodent infestation.

985
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:08,390
-A what?
-Shall | terminate?

986
01:11:08,515 --> 01:11:10,684
No, no, no, no.
He's not a rodent, he's a Chihuahua.

987
01:11:10,809 --> 01:11:13,979
This is my... This is my Chihuahua.
We love Chihuahuas! Don't we?

988
01:11:14,062 --> 01:11:16,815
He's leaked lubricants all over my foot.

989
01:11:18,233 --> 01:11:22,446
-He peed on you? Bad Mojo. Bad Mojo!
-Bad Mojo!

990
01:11:22,529 --> 01:11:24,030
I'm sorry.
He's got a male dominance thing.

991
01:11:24,156 --> 01:11:25,699
That's all it is.

992
01:11:25,824 --> 01:11:28,660
-My foot's gonna rust.
-All right.

993
01:11:29,661 --> 01:11:31,037
Okay, okay.

994
01:11:32,205 --> 01:11:34,875
-Shut up and go hide!
-Just hurry.

995
01:11:38,044 --> 01:11:39,671
Autobots, recon.

996
01:11:41,548 --> 01:11:44,176
| hope he's okay. He's in the kitchen.

997
01:11:44,259 --> 01:11:46,011
Got some ice on his nose.

998
01:11:46,094 --> 01:11:48,555
| had to slap him around a little bit.

999
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:50,056
You did not.

1000
01:11:51,266 --> 01:11:53,310
-You didn't even ground him.
-Almost, almost.

1001
01:11:54,186 --> 01:11:56,730
Where are they? No, no, no, no, no.

1002
01:11:58,773 --> 01:12:00,442
Come on, come on.

1003
01:12:05,238 --> 01:12:08,366
-What? What is this?
-Time is short.

1004
01:12:08,450 --> 01:12:11,036
-They really want those glasses.
-Come on. What are you doing?

1005
01:12:11,119 --> 01:12:12,829
-I'm gonna help you.
-Okay.

1006
01:12:12,913 --> 01:12:14,915
-Please hurry.
-Okay.

1007
01:12:16,249 --> 01:12:18,293
-Yeah, no, no. It's definitely gone.
-What do you mean?

1008
01:12:18,418 --> 01:12:19,419
My glasses were in the bag.

1009
01:12:19,544 --> 01:12:21,379
They were in the backpack
and now the backpack isn't here.

1010
01:12:21,463 --> 01:12:23,048
Well, they're gonna be pissed,
so what do you wanna do?

1011
01:12:23,131 --> 01:12:24,216
So what | think you should do is
you should...

1012
01:12:24,299 --> 01:12:26,510
You should check this whole...
This whole section here.

1013
01:12:26,593 --> 01:12:29,554
Just give it a clean sweep,
and I'll get the corner here.

1014
01:12:29,638 --> 01:12:32,057
Yeah, no, no, no. Not there.
That's my... That's my private...

1015
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:33,475
-Sorry. That's nothing.
-You just...

1016
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:34,684
-You just told me to look...
SR G2

1017
01:12:34,768 --> 01:12:36,144
but | didn't mean to look inside
of my treasure chest.

1018
01:12:36,269 --> 01:12:38,939
You should be way more specific
so | don't get in trouble in your room.

1019
01:12:39,064 --> 01:12:40,982
I'm already stressed out enough.

1020
01:12:41,107 --> 01:12:42,609
Okay. What now?

1021
01:12:44,945 --> 01:12:48,406
No. No, no. No, no, no.

1022
01:12:48,490 --> 01:12:52,327
This isn't hiding. This isn't hiding.
This is my backyard, not a truck stop.

1023
01:12:52,452 --> 01:12:53,578
Oh, God. Oh!

1024
01:12:53,662 --> 01:12:57,832
Okay, | saw it. The UFO landed
right here and now it's gone.

1025
01:12:57,958 --> 01:13:00,293
My moped's under there, man!
Who's gonna pay for that?

1026
01:13:01,670 --> 01:13:03,421
Sam? Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam.

1027
01:13:03,505 --> 01:13:06,466
-He's back here.
-l can't deal with this. | can't...

1028
01:13:06,591 --> 01:13:08,176
What? Oh, no, no, no.

1029
01:13:08,301 --> 01:13:09,344
-This iIs my mother's flower...
-Oops.

1030
01:13:09,469 --> 01:13:10,679
Okay, listen. You got to listen to me.

1031
01:13:10,804 --> 01:13:12,764
If my parents come out here
and see you, they're gonna freak out.

1032
01:13:12,847 --> 01:13:14,349
My mother's got a temper, okay?

1033
01:13:14,474 --> 01:13:16,017
We must have the glasses.

1034
01:13:16,142 --> 01:13:17,686
| know you need the glasses.
I've been looking everywhere.

1035
01:13:17,811 --> 01:13:20,021
They're not here.
They're definitely not here.

1036
01:13:20,146 --> 01:13:21,231
Keep searching.

1037
01:13:21,314 --> 01:13:22,983
| need you to be quiet for five minutes.

1038
01:13:23,108 --> 01:13:24,317
Ten minutes. Okay?

1039
01:13:24,442 --> 01:13:26,194
Please, I'm begging you. You got to...
You're making a racket.

1040
01:13:26,319 --> 01:13:28,280
| can't concentrate.
You want me to look and I'm hearing...

1041
01:13:28,363 --> 01:13:29,447
Calm down, calm down.

1042
01:13:29,531 --> 01:13:31,241
You got to do something here.
You got to do something here.

1043
01:13:31,324 --> 01:13:33,994
-Autobots, fall back.
-Thank you. Please, for five minutes.

1044
01:13:34,119 --> 01:13:35,870
Good? Good? Okay.

1045
01:13:35,996 --> 01:13:37,247
-Move!
-Get away!

1046
01:13:37,330 --> 01:13:39,040
What's the matter with you?
Can't you be quiet?

1047
01:13:39,165 --> 01:13:41,042
He wants us to be quiet.

1048
01:13:44,838 --> 01:13:48,675
Earthquake! Move, move, move, move,
move! Earthquake!

1049
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:52,637
Judy! Judy, get under the table! Move it!
Duck and cover right now!

1050
01:13:52,721 --> 01:13:54,639
How did you get over there so fast?

1051
01:13:55,682 --> 01:13:57,475
Wow! That was tingly!

1052
01:13:58,018 --> 01:14:00,979
-You got to try that!
-Yeah, that looks fun.

1053
01:14:05,817 --> 01:14:07,861
-Sam?
-Sammy?

1054
01:14:10,196 --> 01:14:12,907
-What the hell is that?
-1 don't know.

1055
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:15,493
-Sam?
-That's weird.

1056
01:14:15,577 --> 01:14:17,329
-Sam!
-Ratchet, point the light.

1057
01:14:17,412 --> 01:14:19,998
-Come on, hurry.
-Listen, we got a major issue in here.

1058
01:14:20,081 --> 01:14:21,166
What's with the light?
You gotta stop the light.

1059
01:14:21,249 --> 01:14:23,168
What's going on? Turn it off.
You gotta tell him to shut it off.

1060
01:14:23,251 --> 01:14:24,419
-Shut it off.
-Sam, are you in there?

1061
01:14:24,544 --> 01:14:25,587
How come the door's locked?

1062
01:14:25,712 --> 01:14:29,341
You know the rules.
No doors locked in my house!

1063
01:14:29,424 --> 01:14:30,634
You know he'll start counting

1064
01:14:30,717 --> 01:14:32,010
-If you don't open the door!
-One more chance. Five...

1065
01:14:32,093 --> 01:14:33,219
O M T

1066
01:14:33,345 --> 01:14:35,055
-Four. It's coming off the hinges, pal.
-He's counting!

1067
01:14:35,221 --> 01:14:36,473
-Sam, just open the door.
-Three.

1068
01:14:36,556 --> 01:14:37,641
S0l A1
-Two.

1069
01:14:37,724 --> 01:14:39,851
-He's counting.
-Stand back.

1070
01:14:40,268 --> 01:14:43,980
-What's up? What's with the bat?
-Who were you talking to?

1071
01:14:44,064 --> 01:14:47,067
-I'm talking to you.
-Why are you so sweaty and filthy?

1072
01:14:47,192 --> 01:14:48,777
I'm a child. You know, I'm a teenager.

1073
01:14:48,902 --> 01:14:51,112
We heard voices and noises
and we thought maybe you were...

1074
01:14:51,237 --> 01:14:53,073
It doesn't matter what we thought.
What was that light?

1075
01:14:53,198 --> 01:14:54,991
No, what light? What?
There's no light, Dad! There's no light!

1076
01:14:55,075 --> 01:14:56,576
You got two lights in your hand!
That's what it is.

1077
01:14:56,701 --> 01:14:57,952
-Maybe it bounced...
-There was light under the door.

1078
01:14:58,078 --> 01:15:00,080
Look, you can't... You can't just bounce
into my room like that.

1079
01:15:00,205 --> 01:15:01,581
You got to knock.
You got to communicate.

1080
01:15:01,706 --> 01:15:02,707
-We knocked for five minutes.
-I'm a teenager.

1081
01:15:02,791 --> 01:15:04,167
-We knocked.
-You didn't knock.

1082
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:05,710
-You were screaming at me, okay?
-No.

1083
01:15:05,794 --> 01:15:07,253
This is repression,
what you're doing here.

1084
01:15:07,379 --> 01:15:09,714
-You're ruining my youth, okay?
-Oh, for Pete's sakes!

1085
01:15:09,798 --> 01:15:14,302
You are so defensive!
Were you masturbating?

1086
01:15:16,054 --> 01:15:17,138
-Judy.
-Was I...

1087
01:15:17,263 --> 01:15:18,306
-No, Mom.
-Zip it, okay?

1088
01:15:18,431 --> 01:15:19,724
-It's okay.
-No, | don't masturbate!

1089
01:15:19,808 --> 01:15:20,892
That's not something for you
to bring up.

1090
01:15:20,975 --> 01:15:22,519
-That's a father-and-son thing, okay?
-Father-son thing.

1091
01:15:22,602 --> 01:15:25,438
| mean, you don't have to call it that
word if that makes you uncomfortable.

1092
01:15:25,563 --> 01:15:29,192
You can call it Sam's happy time or...

1093
01:15:29,275 --> 01:15:31,111
-Happy time?
-...my special alone time...

1094
01:15:31,236 --> 01:15:32,278
-Stop.
-Mom.

1095
01:15:32,404 --> 01:15:33,446
-Judy, stop.
A W \YETE

1096
01:15:33,571 --> 01:15:34,572
-Mom, you can't come in and...
-I'm sorry.

1097
01:15:34,656 --> 01:15:36,991
It's just been a weird night.
I've had a little bit to drink.

1098
01:15:37,117 --> 01:15:39,119
-No, no, Dad.
-Yeah, well, we saw a light.

1099
01:15:39,244 --> 01:15:40,995
Oh, parents.

1100
01:15:41,913 --> 01:15:44,749
| don't know where it was, but we saw it.

1101
01:15:45,792 --> 01:15:49,379
Earthquake! It's another one! Another
earthquake! Get in the doorway!

1102
01:15:49,462 --> 01:15:52,006
-Okay!
-Aftershock! Aftershock!

1103
01:15:52,132 --> 01:15:53,216
Oh, | hate these.

1104
01:15:53,299 --> 01:15:54,592
-Got to ride it out. Ride it out!
-Quick, hide.

1105
01:15:54,676 --> 01:15:55,719
-Hey, the lights are back on.
-Hide? What?

1106
01:15:55,802 --> 01:15:57,387
-Where?
-Come on, get out of that tub.

1107
01:15:57,470 --> 01:15:58,805
Can't you take safety seriously?

1108
01:15:58,930 --> 01:16:02,183
-Good Lord, this floor is filthy, Sam.
-Oh, oh, man! Man. Oh.

1109
01:16:02,308 --> 01:16:05,186
Oh, no! Look at the yard.
The yard is destroyed.

1110
01:16:10,275 --> 01:16:13,778
Judy? Better call the city.
We got a blown transformer!

1111
01:16:13,862 --> 01:16:16,406
Power pole's sparking all over
the place!

1112
01:16:16,489 --> 01:16:18,742
Oh, man. Yard's a waste.

1113
01:16:18,825 --> 01:16:20,535
Trashed. Gone.

1114
01:16:20,827 --> 01:16:22,287
-It's a wash. The whole yard.
-You're kidding.

1115
01:16:22,370 --> 01:16:24,414
The parents are very irritating.

1116
01:16:24,497 --> 01:16:26,249
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Can | take them out?

1117
01:16:26,332 --> 01:16:29,085
Ironhide, you know
we don't harm humans.

1118
01:16:29,169 --> 01:16:30,378
What is with you?

1119
01:16:30,503 --> 01:16:33,798
Well, I'm just saying we could.
It's an option.

1120
01:16:33,882 --> 01:16:35,592
We heard you talking
to somebody, Sam.

1121
01:16:35,675 --> 01:16:38,094
-We wanna know who.
-Mom, | told...

1122
01:16:38,178 --> 01:16:40,013
Hi. I'm Mikaela.

1123
01:16:40,722 --> 01:16:43,016
I'm a... I'm a friend of Sam's.

1124
01:16:44,476 --> 01:16:47,228
Gosh, you're gorgeous.
Isn't that the prettiest girl?

1125
01:16:47,353 --> 01:16:50,190
-She can hear you talking, Mom.
-Thank you.

1126
01:16:50,315 --> 01:16:53,359
Oh, my goodness. I'm sorry you had to
hear our little family discussion about...

1127
01:16:53,485 --> 01:16:54,944
-Sorry that we're bugging you.
-Do you have my backpack?

1128
01:16:55,028 --> 01:16:56,112
-Come on, hon. Let's go.
-Oh, it's in the kitchen.

1129
01:17:13,630 --> 01:17:16,966
Oh, yes. Okay. Okay.

1130
01:17:17,050 --> 01:17:18,885
-Yeah.
-Your mom's so nice.

1131
01:17:19,010 --> 01:17:20,136
| want you to distract my parents

1132
01:17:20,220 --> 01:17:22,555
while | slip out and get these glasses
to them, okay?

1133
01:17:28,478 --> 01:17:31,064
-Ronald Wickity?
-It's Witwicky. Who are you?

1134
01:17:31,147 --> 01:17:33,149
We're the government. Sector Seven.

1135
01:17:33,233 --> 01:17:35,401
-Never heard of it.
-Never will.

1136
01:17:35,527 --> 01:17:38,071
Your son's the great-grandson
of Captain Archibald Wickity, is he not?

1137
01:17:38,154 --> 01:17:39,322
It's Witwicky.

1138
01:17:39,405 --> 01:17:42,659
May | enter the premises, sir?

1139
01:17:42,742 --> 01:17:45,495
Ron, there's guys all over the front yard.

1140
01:17:45,578 --> 01:17:46,746
What the heck is going on here?

1141
01:17:46,830 --> 01:17:48,998
Your son filed a stolen car report
last night.

1142
01:17:49,082 --> 01:17:51,334
We think it's involved in
a national security matter.

1143
01:17:51,417 --> 01:17:52,836
-They're ripping up my rose bushes!
-National security?

1144
01:17:52,919 --> 01:17:54,003
That's right. National security.

1145
01:17:54,087 --> 01:17:55,755
My God, Ron, they're everywhere.

1146
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:58,174
LR AR RV ER=1 = 1e Vg o
the house! Look at this!

1147
01:17:58,258 --> 01:18:00,093
Could you stay off the grass?

1148
01:18:00,218 --> 01:18:01,678
Get me a sample
and some isotope readings.

1149
01:18:01,761 --> 01:18:03,346
They're pulling bushes out
of the ground!

1150
01:18:03,429 --> 01:18:06,683
Good Lord! They've got to get
their hands off my bush!

1151
01:18:06,766 --> 01:18:08,268
-Drop the bat, ma‘'am.
-Hey, hey, hey, that's my...

1152
01:18:08,393 --> 01:18:09,686
I'm carrying a loaded weapon.

1153
01:18:09,769 --> 01:18:11,187
But you'd better get those guys
out of my garden

1154
01:18:11,271 --> 01:18:13,439
or | am gonna beat the crap out of them!

1155
01:18:13,523 --> 01:18:16,526
Are you experiencing any flu-like
symptoms? Aching joints? Fever?

1156
01:18:16,609 --> 01:18:18,695
S\ e}
AV YRR 114

1157
01:18:18,778 --> 01:18:21,531
How you doing, son?
Is your name Sam?

1158
01:18:21,614 --> 01:18:23,116
-Yeah.
-Well, | need you to come with us.

1159
01:18:23,241 --> 01:18:24,450
Whoa, way out of line.

1160
01:18:24,576 --> 01:18:28,621
Sir, | am asking politely. Back off.

1161
01:18:28,705 --> 01:18:30,623
-You're not taking my son.
-Really?

1162
01:18:30,707 --> 01:18:31,791
You gonna try to get rough with us?

1163
01:18:31,875 --> 01:18:33,042
No, but I'm gonna call the cops

1164
01:18:33,126 --> 01:18:35,378
because there's something fishy
going on around here.

1165
01:18:35,461 --> 01:18:38,214
Yeah. There's something a little fishy
r=1oJo0 1 @YoV Ao V K-Tolo

1166
01:18:38,298 --> 01:18:42,218
your little Taco Bell dog and this
whole operation you got going on here.

1167
01:18:42,302 --> 01:18:44,554
-What operation?
-That is what we are gonna find out.

1168
01:18:44,637 --> 01:18:47,265
| think direct contact.

1169
01:18:52,645 --> 01:18:54,272
-Son?
-Yeah.

1170
01:18:55,273 --> 01:18:58,234
-Step forward, please.
-Just stand?

1171
01:19:03,948 --> 01:19:05,450
Fourteen rads.

1172
01:19:06,993 --> 01:19:08,494
Bingo! Tag them and bag them!

1173
01:19:09,245 --> 01:19:11,164
If you hurt my dog, I'll kick your ass!

1174
01:19:11,247 --> 01:19:12,916
Get me a sample on
that vegetation ASAP!

1175
01:19:12,999 --> 01:19:14,584
Sam! Do not say anything, Sam!

1176
01:19:14,667 --> 01:19:16,586
-Yeah.
-Not a word until we get a lawyer!

1177
01:19:23,426 --> 01:19:26,930
LadiesMan217.

1178
01:19:27,013 --> 01:19:30,433
That is your eBay username, right?

1179
01:19:30,516 --> 01:19:32,852
Yeah, but, you know,
it was a typo and | ran with it.

1180
01:19:32,977 --> 01:19:34,020
What do you make of this?

1181
01:19:34,145 --> 01:19:36,606
My name is Sam Witwicky, okay?
And my...

1182
01:19:36,689 --> 01:19:37,857
Is that you?

1183
01:19:37,941 --> 01:19:40,109
Yeah, that sounds like LadiesMan.

1184
01:19:40,193 --> 01:19:45,114
Last night at the station, you told
the officer your car transformed.

1185
01:19:46,366 --> 01:19:48,785
-Enlighten me.
-Well, here's what | said, okay?

1186
01:19:48,868 --> 01:19:53,289
'Cause this is a total misunderstanding
that my car had been stolen...

1187
01:19:53,373 --> 01:19:55,541
-Really?
-...from me, from my home,

1188
01:19:55,667 --> 01:19:58,628
but it's fine now because it's back!
It came back!

1189
01:19:58,711 --> 01:20:00,463
-Well, not by itself.
-Well, no.

1190
01:20:00,546 --> 01:20:04,008
Because cars don't do that
because that would be crazy.

1191
01:20:07,136 --> 01:20:08,721
That's funny. That is so funny.

1192
01:20:08,846 --> 01:20:11,349
So what do you kids know
about aliens, huh?

1193
01:20:12,517 --> 01:20:15,311
Oh, you mean, like a Martian?
Like what, E.T.? No.

1194
01:20:15,395 --> 01:20:16,896
-It's an urban legend.
-Yeah.

1195
01:20:16,980 --> 01:20:18,147
You see this?

1196
01:20:18,231 --> 01:20:20,817
This is an I-can-do-whatever-l-want
and-get-away-with-it badge.

1197
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:23,653
-Right.
-I'm gonna lock you up forever.

1198
01:20:23,736 --> 01:20:24,988
Oh, God. You know what?
Don't listen to him.

1199
01:20:25,071 --> 01:20:27,490
He's just pissy 'cause he's got to
get back to guarding the mall.

1200
01:20:27,573 --> 01:20:30,660
You, in the training bra, do not test me.

1201
01:20:30,743 --> 01:20:32,912
Especially with your daddy's parole
olepplgleio}

1202
01:20:32,996 --> 01:20:34,414
What? Parole?

1203
01:20:34,497 --> 01:20:37,834
-It's nothing.
-Oh, grand theft auto, that ain't nothing?

1204
01:20:37,917 --> 01:20:39,919
You know those cars my dad
used to teach me to fix?

1205
01:20:40,044 --> 01:20:41,754
Well, they... They weren't always his.

1206
01:20:41,879 --> 01:20:43,006
You stole cars?

1207
01:20:43,089 --> 01:20:44,757
Well, we couldn't always afford
a babysitter,

1208
01:20:44,882 --> 01:20:46,676
so sometimes he had to take me along.

1209
01:20:46,759 --> 01:20:49,095
She's got her own juvie record
to prove it!

1210
01:20:49,178 --> 01:20:51,848
She's a criminal. Criminals are hot.

1211
01:20:52,932 --> 01:20:57,603
That'd be a real shame if he had to rot
in jail the rest of his natural life.

1212
01:20:57,687 --> 01:21:00,023
It IS time to talk!

1213
01:21:06,738 --> 01:21:08,197
Big! It's big!

1214
01:21:12,910 --> 01:21:14,912
Go, go, go, go!

1215
01:21:15,288 --> 01:21:17,957
-l can't see it! | can't see it!
-Shift your weight towards the front!

1216
01:21:18,041 --> 01:21:19,459
All right! All right!

1217
01:21:34,057 --> 01:21:36,392
You A-holes are in trouble now.

1218
01:21:36,476 --> 01:21:42,982
Gentlemen, | want to introduce you
to my friend, Optimus Prime.

1219
01:21:45,234 --> 01:21:48,988
Taking the children was a bad move.

1220
01:21:49,113 --> 01:21:52,492
Autobots, relieve them of their weapons.

1221
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:57,830
Freezel

1222
01:21:58,456 --> 01:21:59,916
-Whoa! Whoal
-Give me those!

1223
01:21:59,999 --> 01:22:01,084
Whoal!

1224
01:22:02,460 --> 01:22:03,586
Whoal!

1225
01:22:14,305 --> 01:22:15,681
Hi, there.

1226
01:22:15,973 --> 01:22:20,686
You don't seem afraid.
Are you not surprised to see us?

1227
01:22:21,354 --> 01:22:26,359
Look, there are
S-Seven protocols, okay?

1228
01:22:26,943 --> 01:22:28,277
I'm not authorized
to communicate with you

1229
01:22:28,361 --> 01:22:30,613
except to tell you
| can't communicate with you.

1230
01:22:30,696 --> 01:22:33,324
-Get out of the car.
-All right.

1231
01:22:33,866 --> 01:22:35,034
-Me? You want me to get...
-Now!

1232
01:22:35,159 --> 01:22:36,619
All right, all right. Get out. Hey.

1233
01:22:36,702 --> 01:22:40,123
All right, I'm... I'm getting out.
I'm getting out. You see?

1234
01:22:40,206 --> 01:22:43,709
Very nifty how you put us down
without really killing us.

1235
01:22:43,835 --> 01:22:45,378
You're good with handcuffs, too,
now, huh?

1236
01:22:45,461 --> 01:22:46,462
How you doing?

1237
01:22:46,546 --> 01:22:48,297
-You weren't supposed to hear all that.
-How's it going, huh?

1238
01:22:48,381 --> 01:22:50,550
-Yeah.
NN

1239
01:22:50,675 --> 01:22:53,803
Now, listen. If | choose to engage
with him, mum is the word, all right?

1240
01:22:53,886 --> 01:22:57,723
Sam, | have a record
because | wouldn't turn my dad in.

1241
01:22:58,307 --> 01:23:02,520
When have you had to sacrifice
anything in your perfect little life?

1242
01:23:04,021 --> 01:23:05,731
Big guys. Big guys with big guns, huh?

1243
01:23:05,815 --> 01:23:08,651
What is Sector Seven? Answer me.

1244
01:23:08,734 --> 01:23:11,320
I'm the one who asks questions
around here. Not you, young man!

1245
01:23:11,404 --> 01:23:13,656
-How'd you know about the aliens?
-Where did you take my parents?

1246
01:23:13,739 --> 01:23:15,741
-l am not at liberty to discuss it.
-No?

1247
01:23:15,825 --> 01:23:17,660
Hey. You touch me,
that's a federal offense.

1248
01:23:17,743 --> 01:23:19,495
Do-whatever-you-want
and-get-away-with-it badge, right?

1249
01:23:19,579 --> 01:23:22,498
Yeah. Brave now all of a sudden, with
his big alien friend standing over there.

1250
01:23:22,582 --> 01:23:25,751
-Where is Sector Seven?
-Wouldn't you like to know?

1251
01:23:32,091 --> 01:23:35,011
Bumblebee, stop lubricating the man.

1252
01:23:35,094 --> 01:23:37,096
Get that thing to stop, huh?

1253
01:23:38,556 --> 01:23:41,851
-All right, tough guy, take it off.
-What are you talking about?

1254
01:23:41,934 --> 01:23:44,687
-Your clothes, all of it, off.
eIl 1 1 W4

1255
01:23:45,897 --> 01:23:47,732
For threatening my dad.

1256
01:23:50,776 --> 01:23:56,741
Little lady, this is the beginning
of the end of your life.

1257
01:23:58,451 --> 01:24:00,119
You're a criminal.

1258
01:24:00,786 --> 01:24:03,623
Let's face facts. It's in your gene pool.

1259
01:24:05,082 --> 01:24:07,877
Those are nice.
Now get behind the pole.

1260
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:09,045
All right.

1261
01:24:09,128 --> 01:24:11,255
This is such a felony, what you're doing.

1262
01:24:13,257 --> 01:24:15,134
-I will hunt you down, okay?
-He'll hunt you down.

1263
01:24:15,259 --> 01:24:17,470
-Without any remorse!
-No remorse.

1264
01:24:17,553 --> 01:24:18,804
-Enjoy.
-Okay?

1265
01:24:18,930 --> 01:24:23,392
-We have got to alert everyone.
-They already know. Speaker.

1266
01:24:29,899 --> 01:24:31,817
Optimus! Incoming!

1267
01:24:39,492 --> 01:24:40,785
Roll out.

1268
01:24:47,667 --> 01:24:51,003
Okay, I'm picking up rad readings
under that bridge right down there.

1269
01:24:53,839 --> 01:24:57,260
Okay, I'm getting really good rad
readings. Forty-two and higher.

1270
01:24:57,343 --> 01:24:58,761
SJoRY/elVNo<#

1271
01:25:03,432 --> 01:25:05,434
Okay, we're dropping in.

1272
01:25:09,438 --> 01:25:12,024
Really strong readings right down
below us. There he is.

1273
01:25:12,149 --> 01:25:14,318
Ship one and two, come on in.

1274
01:25:15,361 --> 01:25:18,030
That's it, right there.
Mark him, mark him.

1275
01:25:18,114 --> 01:25:21,367
Okay, there he is. 11:30. 11.:30.
Right off the nose.

1276
01:25:21,867 --> 01:25:23,494
gotit. 12:00.

1277
01:25:27,540 --> 01:25:29,000
Okay, I'm tracking him. I've got him.

1278
01:25:31,961 --> 01:25:34,171
Got him going down the street.

1279
01:25:37,717 --> 01:25:42,346
Okay. Where'd he go, guys? | lost him.
Got no IR signature. Where'd he go?

1280
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:44,849
Okay, | lost him. | lost him.

1281
01:25:45,391 --> 01:25:47,393
Okay, we're coming around.

1282
01:26:10,082 --> 01:26:11,667
Easy, you two.

1283
01:26:21,010 --> 01:26:24,263
No! No! No, Sam! Sam, don't drop me!

1284
01:26:24,889 --> 01:26:27,933
Sam, don't! Sam, don't! I'm slipping!
I'm slipping!

1285
01:26:29,101 --> 01:26:31,228
-Hold on!
-No!

1286
01:26:41,739 --> 01:26:44,867
All right, we've got him pinned.
We've got him pinned in the river.

1287
01:26:44,950 --> 01:26:46,285
I'm in for the shot.

1288
01:26:46,369 --> 01:26:47,787
Stop! Stop!

1289
01:26:48,954 --> 01:26:50,790
Wait! No!

1290
01:26:54,126 --> 01:26:56,796
-Take the shot, get him.
-Take the shot.

1291
01:27:14,605 --> 01:27:16,774
No! Stop!

1292
01:27:17,316 --> 01:27:18,651
Stop!

1293
01:27:19,235 --> 01:27:22,655
Get down on the ground! Get down!
Get down!

1294
01:27:23,656 --> 01:27:24,990
What? Okay.

1295
01:27:26,826 --> 01:27:29,078
Look, he's not fighting back!

1296
01:27:29,620 --> 01:27:31,831
Freeze it! Freeze it! Freeze it!

1297
01:27:38,170 --> 01:27:39,797
Stop hurting him!

1298
01:27:49,181 --> 01:27:50,933
Don't let him move!

1299
01:27:51,642 --> 01:27:53,185
| got him here!

1300
01:28:21,464 --> 01:28:23,299
Happy to see me again?

1301
01:28:24,717 --> 01:28:27,511
Put him in a car
with his little criminal friend.

1302
01:28:33,350 --> 01:28:36,479
| want that thing frozen
and ready for transport!

1303
01:28:44,570 --> 01:28:46,906
Hang back. Let me check it out.

1304
01:28:49,700 --> 01:28:51,160
Optimus,

1305
01:28:53,412 --> 01:28:55,915
are we just gonna stand here
and do nothing?

1306
01:28:56,040 --> 01:28:59,752
There's no way to free Bumblebee
without harming the humans.

1307
01:28:59,835 --> 01:29:02,671
-But it's not right. He...
-Let them leave.

1308
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:17,019
The Chinese and the Russians
are nearing our area of operations

1309
01:29:17,102 --> 01:29:18,270
In the western Pacific.

1310
01:29:18,354 --> 01:29:20,523
We feel like this could get
out of hand real fast.

1311
01:29:20,606 --> 01:29:23,442
But the next couple of hours
may just define his presidency.

1312
01:29:27,738 --> 01:29:30,616
US and Chinese task forces
approaching 100 nautical miles

1313
01:29:30,741 --> 01:29:32,034
of cruise missile range.

1314
01:29:32,117 --> 01:29:35,704
Tell the strike group commander that
he's not to engage unless fired on first.

1315
01:29:35,788 --> 01:29:37,790
-Yes, sir!
S\ I EST=Tel =1V

1316
01:29:40,125 --> 01:29:45,214
Tom Banachek. I'm with Sector Seven,
Advanced Research Division.

1317
01:29:45,297 --> 01:29:48,592
Never heard of it. I'm a little busy, Tom.
| think you can see that.

1318
01:29:51,637 --> 01:29:54,223
-What's going on here?
-1 don't know.

1319
01:29:57,810 --> 01:30:00,479
Sit rep! Talk to me!

1320
01:30:00,604 --> 01:30:02,982
-The whole room's gone down, sir.
- can see that!

1321
01:30:03,107 --> 01:30:04,817
The virus was coded to shut us down.

1322
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:07,319
-General?
-I'll take a seat.

1323
01:30:08,153 --> 01:30:09,321
What do you mean, "shut us down"?

1324
01:30:09,405 --> 01:30:12,408
They used our network to spread out
to the whole world.

1325
01:30:12,491 --> 01:30:13,659
The blackout's global.

1326
01:30:13,742 --> 01:30:16,579
We have no communications,
satellite and land lines are dead.

1327
01:30:16,662 --> 01:30:21,166
You mean to tell me that | cannot pick
up this telephone and call my family?

1328
01:30:27,131 --> 01:30:31,468
Mr. Secretary? I'm here under
direct order from the President.

1329
01:30:33,429 --> 01:30:35,848
You really need to see
what | have in the case.

1330
01:30:38,851 --> 01:30:40,436
You'll have to accept that
there are certain things

1331
01:30:40,519 --> 01:30:42,688
you won't understand right away.

1332
01:30:42,771 --> 01:30:46,108
Sector Seven is a special-access
division of the government

1333
01:30:46,191 --> 01:30:49,612
convened in secret under
President Hoover 80 years ago.

1334
01:30:50,446 --> 01:30:54,533
You may remember NASA JPL
lost the Beagle 2 Mars Rover.

1335
01:30:55,659 --> 01:30:59,955
We told them to report the mission
a complete failure. It wasn't.

1336
01:31:00,372 --> 01:31:02,833
Beagle 2 transmitted 13 seconds.

1337
01:31:03,375 --> 01:31:05,961
This was classified above top secret.

1338
01:31:20,893 --> 01:31:23,562
EDA ended at 170 hours, 48 minutes.

1339
01:31:23,646 --> 01:31:26,315
More than just a pile of Martian rocks.

1340
01:31:27,566 --> 01:31:29,693
This is the image from Mars.

1341
01:31:30,486 --> 01:31:33,238
Here's the image your
Special Ops team was able to retrieve

1342
01:31:33,364 --> 01:31:35,157
from the base attack.

1343
01:31:35,908 --> 01:31:39,036
We believe they are of
the same exoskeletal type,

1344
01:31:39,870 --> 01:31:42,665
and obviously not Russian
or North Korean.

1345
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:45,751
Are we talking about an invasion?

1346
01:31:45,834 --> 01:31:48,921
We intercepted the message
from your Special Ops team.

1347
01:31:49,004 --> 01:31:52,341
These things can be hurt by
our weapons and now they know it.

1348
01:31:52,424 --> 01:31:54,176
That's why the virus shut us down,

1349
01:31:54,259 --> 01:31:57,596
so we can't coordinate against
their next attack,

1350
01:31:57,680 --> 01:32:02,226
which | would bet my ridiculous
government salary is coming soon.

1351
01:32:06,063 --> 01:32:08,440
Get word to our fleet commanders
over the National Guard frequency.

1352
01:32:08,524 --> 01:32:11,944
It's a shortwave radio channel.
It might be still working.

1353
01:32:12,027 --> 01:32:15,364
Tell them to turn their ships around
and come home. ASAP!

1354
01:32:15,447 --> 01:32:18,450
And inform all commands to prepare
for imminent attack.

1355
01:32:28,627 --> 01:32:31,880
Captain Lennox, we need you and
your team to come with us right now!

1356
01:32:31,964 --> 01:32:33,090
Let's go!

1357
01:32:37,970 --> 01:32:39,471
She's in here.

1358
01:32:39,805 --> 01:32:41,557
What's going on?

1359
01:32:42,057 --> 01:32:43,934
You're coming with me.

1360
01:32:44,309 --> 01:32:47,062
-You're going to be my advisor.
-Me, too?

1361
01:32:47,980 --> 01:32:49,398
Who's this?

1362
01:32:50,149 --> 01:32:53,277
-He's my advisor.
-He comes, too.

1363
01:33:04,496 --> 01:33:06,999
-S0...
-What'd they get you for?

1364
01:33:08,083 --> 01:33:12,337
| bought a carr.
Turned out to be an alien robot.

1365
01:33:12,463 --> 01:33:13,505
Wow.

1366
01:33:14,089 --> 01:33:15,257
Who knew?

1367
01:33:32,024 --> 01:33:33,942
Make a hole! Watch your back!

1368
01:33:44,703 --> 01:33:47,498
Please, let this work.

1369
01:33:48,874 --> 01:33:50,793
Fire it up, Optimus.

1370
01:33:51,710 --> 01:33:53,212
The code.

1371
01:33:53,337 --> 01:33:58,717
The code on these glasses indicates
the All Spark is 230 miles from here.

1372
01:34:00,552 --> 01:34:04,389
| sense the Decepticons
are getting ready to mobilize.

1373
01:34:05,516 --> 01:34:07,309
They must know it's here, as well.

1374
01:34:07,392 --> 01:34:08,727
\What about Bumblebee?

1375
01:34:08,811 --> 01:34:12,898
We can't just leave him to die
and become some human experiment!

1376
01:34:12,981 --> 01:34:16,985
He'll die in vain
if we don't accomplish our mission.

1377
01:34:17,069 --> 01:34:21,323
Bumblebee is a brave soldier.
This is what he would want.

1378
01:34:21,406 --> 01:34:24,409
Why are we fighting to save
the humans?

1379
01:34:25,744 --> 01:34:29,164
They're a primitive and violent race.

1380
01:34:31,416 --> 01:34:33,502
Were we so different?

1381
01:34:34,378 --> 01:34:38,757
They're a young species.
They have much to learn.

1382
01:34:38,841 --> 01:34:41,677
But I've seen goodness in them.

1383
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:45,931
I lcTo o R gl Nl slol i
all sentient beings.

1384
01:34:46,014 --> 01:34:50,269
VIV Lol g l= RN o g1\ Ao g 1R = 1Y%
to end this war.

1385
01:34:50,352 --> 01:34:53,105
We must destroy the Cube.

1386
01:34:53,856 --> 01:34:58,443
If all else fails, | will unite it
with the spark in my chest.

1387
01:34:58,527 --> 01:34:59,862
That's suicide.

1388
01:34:59,945 --> 01:35:03,782
The Cube is raw power.
It could destroy you both.

1389
01:35:03,866 --> 01:35:08,370
A necessary sacrifice to bring peace
to this planet.

1390
01:35:08,453 --> 01:35:11,790
We cannot let the humans pay
ol VAN CGEY

1391
01:35:13,208 --> 01:35:15,961
It's been an honor serving with you all.

1392
01:35:16,044 --> 01:35:19,798
-Autobots, roll out!
-We rolling!

1393
01:35:31,810 --> 01:35:35,063
Team attention! Present arms!

1394
01:35:35,647 --> 01:35:39,985
At ease. Captain, Sergeant.
Got your intel. Excellent work.

1395
01:35:40,068 --> 01:35:41,737
Thank you, sir.
What about the gunships?

1396
01:35:41,820 --> 01:35:43,989
They're being retrofitted
with sabot rounds now.

1397
01:35:44,072 --> 01:35:45,324
If they hit us again,
we'll be ready for them.

1398
01:35:45,449 --> 01:35:48,577
But it won't do us much good if we can't
get world communications back up.

1399
01:35:49,995 --> 01:35:51,330
Hey, kid.

1400
01:35:52,331 --> 01:35:55,000
| think we got off to a bad start, huh?

1401
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:56,668
You must be hungry?

1402
01:35:56,752 --> 01:35:58,754
You want a latte? HoHo?
Double venti macchiato?

1403
01:35:58,837 --> 01:36:00,505
Where's my car?

1404
01:36:00,589 --> 01:36:04,176
Son, | need you to listen to me
very carefully.

1405
01:36:04,676 --> 01:36:06,345
People can die here.

1406
01:36:06,678 --> 01:36:09,431
We need to know everything you know.
We need to know it now.

1407
01:36:09,514 --> 01:36:10,766
Okay.

1408
01:36:10,849 --> 01:36:14,603
But first, I'll take my car, my parents.
Maybe you should write that down.

1409
01:36:14,686 --> 01:36:19,358
Oh, and her juvie record.
That's got to be gone. Like, forever.

1410
01:36:21,026 --> 01:36:24,029
Come with me.
We'll talk about your car.

1411
01:36:24,112 --> 01:36:25,364
Thank you.

1412
01:36:26,865 --> 01:36:28,367
The man's an extortionist.

1413
01:36:30,327 --> 01:36:31,703
All right, here's the situation.

1414
01:36:31,787 --> 01:36:34,206
You've all had direct contact
with the NBEs.

1415
01:36:35,457 --> 01:36:39,044
Non-Biological Extraterrestrials.
Try and keep up with the acronyms.

1416
01:36:39,169 --> 01:36:42,839
What you're about to see
is totally classified.

1417
01:36:51,974 --> 01:36:53,850
Dear God. What is this?

1418
01:36:55,394 --> 01:36:58,647
We think when he made his approach
over the north pole,

1419
01:36:58,730 --> 01:37:02,234
our gravitational field screwed up
his telemetry.

1420
01:37:02,317 --> 01:37:06,321
He crashed in the ice,
probably a few thousand years ago.

1421
01:37:06,405 --> 01:37:09,658
We shipped him here to this facility
in 1934.

1422
01:37:09,741 --> 01:37:12,160
We call him NBE One.

1423
01:37:12,244 --> 01:37:14,663
Well, sir, | don't mean to correct you
on everything you think you know,

1424
01:37:14,746 --> 01:37:17,165
but, | mean, that's Megatron.

1425
01:37:18,417 --> 01:37:20,252
He's the leader of the Decepticons.

1426
01:37:20,335 --> 01:37:23,672
He's been in cryostasis since 1935.

1427
01:37:23,755 --> 01:37:27,259
Your great-great-grandfather made
one of the greatest discoveries

1428
01:37:27,342 --> 01:37:28,760
in the history of mankind.

1429
01:37:28,885 --> 01:37:31,847
Fact is, you're looking at
the source of the modern age,

1430
01:37:31,930 --> 01:37:38,770
the microchip, lasers, spaceflight, cars,
all reverse-engineered by studying him.

1431
01:37:38,854 --> 01:37:42,691
NBE One. That's what we call it.

1432
01:37:43,233 --> 01:37:45,861
And you didn't think the United States
military might need to know

1433
01:37:45,944 --> 01:37:48,363
that you're keeping a hostile alien robot
frozen in the basement?

1434
01:37:48,447 --> 01:37:52,451
Until these events, we had no
credible threat to national security.

1435
01:37:52,534 --> 01:37:54,453
Well, you got one now.

1436
01:37:55,287 --> 01:37:57,789
-So why Earth?
-It's the All Spark.

1437
01:37:57,873 --> 01:37:59,374
All Spark? What is that?

1438
01:37:59,458 --> 01:38:02,044
Well, yeah, they came here looking
for some sort of cube-looking thing.

1439
01:38:02,127 --> 01:38:06,965
Anyway, Mr. NBE One here, AKA
Megatron, that's what they call him,

1440
01:38:07,049 --> 01:38:09,468
who's pretty much the harbinger
of death, wants to use the Cube

1441
01:38:09,551 --> 01:38:12,637
to transform human technology
to take over the universe.

1442
01:38:12,763 --> 01:38:14,306
That's their plan.

1443
01:38:14,389 --> 01:38:16,808
-And you're sure about that?
-Yeah.

1444
01:38:19,144 --> 01:38:21,438
You guys know where it is, don't you?

1445
01:38:22,814 --> 01:38:23,982
Follow me.

1446
01:38:27,611 --> 01:38:30,155
You're about to see our crown jewel.

1447
01:38:38,997 --> 01:38:42,667
Carbon dating puts the Cube here
around 10,000 BC.

1448
01:38:43,502 --> 01:38:45,837
The first Seven didn't find it until 1913.

1449
01:38:48,006 --> 01:38:51,843
They knew it was alien because of
the matching hieroglyphics on the Cube

1450
01:38:51,968 --> 01:38:53,512
as well as NBE One.

1451
01:38:53,595 --> 01:38:56,181
President Hoover had the dam built
around it.

1452
01:38:56,264 --> 01:38:58,683
Four football fields thick of concrete.

1453
01:38:58,767 --> 01:39:02,104
A perfect way to hide its energy
from being detected by anyone

1454
01:39:02,187 --> 01:39:05,816
or any alien species on the outside.

1455
01:39:44,563 --> 01:39:48,400
Walit, back up. You said
the dam hides the Cube's energy.

1456
01:39:49,025 --> 01:39:51,570
-What kind exactly?
-Good question.

1457
01:39:56,074 --> 01:39:59,035
Please step inside.
They have to lock us in.

1458
01:40:04,916 --> 01:40:06,585
Oh, wow.

1459
01:40:06,710 --> 01:40:08,753
What's that? Freddy Krueger done
been up in here or something?

1460
01:40:08,837 --> 01:40:10,046
Oh, no, man.

1461
01:40:10,172 --> 01:40:14,676
Freddy Krueger have four blades, man.
That's only three. That's Wolverine!

1462
01:40:14,759 --> 01:40:17,679
-Right? That's Wolverine!
-That's very funny.

1463
01:40:19,181 --> 01:40:22,267
Anybody have any mechanical devices?
BlackBerry? Key alarm? Cell phone?

1464
01:40:22,350 --> 01:40:23,768
| got a phone.

1465
01:40:26,938 --> 01:40:29,608
Nokias are real nasty.

1466
01:40:29,691 --> 01:40:34,112
You've got to respect the Japanese.
They know the way of the samurai.

1467
01:40:34,905 --> 01:40:37,032
Nokia's from Finland.

1468
01:40:37,115 --> 01:40:41,745
Yes, but he's, you know, a little strange.
He's a little strange.

1469
01:40:44,456 --> 01:40:50,086
We're able to take the Cube radiation
and funnel it into that box.

1470
01:41:03,683 --> 01:41:07,020
-Mean little sucker, huh?
-That thing is freaky!

1471
01:41:07,145 --> 01:41:10,815
Kind of like the itty-bitty
Energizer Bunny from hell, huh?

1472
01:41:21,826 --> 01:41:23,703
He's breaking the box.

1473
01:41:41,680 --> 01:41:42,806
Elo N oI N ETe!

1474
01:41:42,889 --> 01:41:44,015
Movel!

1475
01:41:52,524 --> 01:41:55,193
Gentlemen, they know the Cube is here.

1476
01:41:55,902 --> 01:41:57,279
Banachek. What's going on?

1477
01:41:57,362 --> 01:41:59,239
Well, the NBE One hangar
has lost power...

1478
01:41:59,364 --> 01:42:00,407
-What?
-...and the backup generator

1479
01:42:00,532 --> 01:42:02,492
-IS just not gonna cut it.
-Do you have an arms room?

1480
01:42:08,873 --> 01:42:10,625
Megatron! Megatron! Megatron!

1481
01:42:10,709 --> 01:42:12,127
I'll bring security to the...

1482
01:42:12,210 --> 01:42:14,754
Get everyone to
the NBE One chamber now!

1483
01:42:14,879 --> 01:42:16,464
SR lal SR-1=Nell4.
-Move it! Move it!

1484
01:42:16,548 --> 01:42:17,924
Let's go!

1485
01:42:18,049 --> 01:42:19,843
They're popping our generators!

1486
01:42:31,771 --> 01:42:33,231
Megatron melting!

1487
01:42:33,773 --> 01:42:36,901
16502. We're losing pressure.

1488
01:42:37,027 --> 01:42:39,195
Stand by! Set!

1489
01:42:39,279 --> 01:42:41,364
We're losing pressure!

1490
01:42:41,448 --> 01:42:44,909
The cryogenic system is failing!
We're losing NBE One!

1491
01:42:49,622 --> 01:42:52,334
Forty millimeter sabot rounds
on that table!

1492
01:42:52,417 --> 01:42:56,463
That's good. Get all the ammo you got.
Everything you can carry. Bring it.

1493
01:43:01,968 --> 01:43:04,637
You got to take me to my car.
You have to take me to my car.

1494
01:43:04,763 --> 01:43:05,764
He's gonna know what to do
with the Cube.

1495
01:43:05,889 --> 01:43:07,807
-Your car? It's confiscated.
-Then unconfiscate it.

1496
01:43:07,932 --> 01:43:09,642
We do not know what will happen
if we let it near this thing!

1497
01:43:09,768 --> 01:43:11,019
-You don't know.
-Maybe you know, but | don't know.

1498
01:43:11,102 --> 01:43:12,479
You just wanna sit here and walit
and see what happens?

1499
01:43:12,604 --> 01:43:14,564
| have people's lives at stake here,
young man.

1500
01:43:14,647 --> 01:43:16,441
Take him to his car!

1501
01:43:18,109 --> 01:43:19,361
Drop it.

1502
01:43:21,112 --> 01:43:22,781
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1503
01:43:24,032 --> 01:43:26,034
Drop your weapon, soldier.

1504
01:43:26,534 --> 01:43:28,286
There's an alien war going on
and you're gonna shoot me?

1505
01:43:28,370 --> 01:43:29,412
You know, we didn't ask to be here.

1506
01:43:29,496 --> 01:43:31,706
I'm ordering you under S-Seven
executive jurisdiction.

1507
01:43:31,790 --> 01:43:32,999
S-Seven don't exist.

1508
01:43:33,124 --> 01:43:34,876
Right. And we don't take orders
from people that don't exist.

1509
01:43:34,959 --> 01:43:38,213
-I'm gonna count to five. Okay.
-Well, I'm gonna count to three.

1510
01:43:40,799 --> 01:43:42,467
-Simmons?
S W4

1511
01:43:42,550 --> 01:43:46,638
I'd do what he says. Losing's really
not an option for these guys.

1512
01:43:51,142 --> 01:43:53,103
All right. Okay.

1513
01:43:53,186 --> 01:43:57,774
Hey, you want to lay the fate of the
world on the kid's Camaro? That's cool.

1514
01:44:01,236 --> 01:44:02,570
No, no!

1515
01:44:03,488 --> 01:44:06,199
Stop! You got to stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

1516
01:44:06,324 --> 01:44:09,869
No, no, stop, stop, stop!
Let him go! Let him go!

1517
01:44:11,037 --> 01:44:12,497
Are you okay?

1518
01:44:14,332 --> 01:44:16,418
They didn't hurt you, right?

1519
01:44:25,176 --> 01:44:29,013
Listen to me. The Cube is here
and the Decepticons are coming.

1520
01:44:31,349 --> 01:44:33,476
No, no, don't worry about them.
They're okay. Right?

1521
01:44:33,560 --> 01:44:35,812
They're not gonna hurt you.

1522
01:44:35,895 --> 01:44:39,441
Just back up a little bit.
He's friendly. He's fine.

1523
01:44:39,524 --> 01:44:42,819
Okay, come on. Put the guns down.
They're not gonna hurt you.

1524
01:44:42,902 --> 01:44:44,446
Here, come with me.
I'm gonna take you to the All Spark.

1525
01:45:06,468 --> 01:45:09,971
Okay, here we go. He doing something.
He doing something.

1526
01:45:30,074 --> 01:45:31,451
Oh, my God.

1527
01:45:36,206 --> 01:45:37,665
Message from Starfleet, Captain.

1528
01:45:37,749 --> 01:45:39,167
Let's get fo it.

1529
01:45:39,250 --> 01:45:42,295
He's right. We stay here, we're screwed
with Megatron in the other hangar.

1530
01:45:42,378 --> 01:45:43,796
Mission City is 22 miles away.

1531
01:45:43,880 --> 01:45:45,173
We're gonna sneak that Cube
out of here

1532
01:45:45,256 --> 01:45:46,549
and we're gonna hide it somewhere
in the city.

1533
01:45:46,633 --> 01:45:47,759
Good! Right.

1534
01:45:47,842 --> 01:45:50,595
But we cannot make a stand
without the Air Force.

1535
01:45:50,678 --> 01:45:52,764
This place must have some kind
of radio link!

1536
01:45:52,847 --> 01:45:54,724
-Yes. Shortwave, CB.
S aeg| MAYTR

1537
01:45:54,807 --> 01:45:57,435
Sir, you got to figure out some way
to get word out to them. Let's move!

1538
01:45:57,519 --> 01:45:58,978
In the alien archive, sir!

1539
01:45:59,062 --> 01:46:01,064
-The alien...
-There's an old Army radio console.

1540
01:46:01,147 --> 01:46:02,732
-Will it work?
-Anything's possible!

1541
01:46:02,815 --> 01:46:05,235
-Did you see that...
-All right, Sam, get it in the car!

1542
01:46:05,318 --> 01:46:07,111
Mr. Secretary! Get our birds in the air.

1543
01:46:07,195 --> 01:46:08,863
When we get to the city,
we're gonna find a radio,

1544
01:46:08,947 --> 01:46:10,907
and I'll have Epps vector them in, okay?

1545
01:46:10,990 --> 01:46:12,575
Affirmative!

1546
01:46:12,659 --> 01:46:16,496
Warning! NBE One
cryo-containment failing.

1547
01:46:17,455 --> 01:46:19,374
Check that backup system!

1548
01:46:19,457 --> 01:46:23,628
The cryo's failing! You got to bump up
the cryo! The cryo's failing!

1549
01:46:23,711 --> 01:46:25,255
Come on! Get out of here!

1550
01:46:25,338 --> 01:46:26,881
Heads up! Look out!

1551
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:30,260
Set a perimeter around
the yellow vehicle!

1552
01:46:30,343 --> 01:46:33,805
-This way, this way, this way!
-Up there! Let's go!

1553
01:46:43,481 --> 01:46:46,609
| am Megatron!

1554
01:47:05,378 --> 01:47:06,796
-The Cube's okay?
-Yeah, it's fine.

1555
01:47:06,879 --> 01:47:07,922
Well, put the seat belt on.

1556
01:47:08,006 --> 01:47:09,173
Pour it on him!

1557
01:47:22,895 --> 01:47:24,939
| live to serve you, Lord Megatron.

1558
01:47:25,023 --> 01:47:27,442
Where is the Cube?

1559
01:47:27,525 --> 01:47:29,611
The humans have taken it.

1560
01:47:32,947 --> 01:47:36,826
You fail me yet again, Starscream.
Get them!

1561
01:47:37,243 --> 01:47:38,745
Come on, Mags!

1562
01:47:39,829 --> 01:47:41,331
Over here, sir!

1563
01:47:43,666 --> 01:47:45,752
Give me a minute. Give me a minute.

1564
01:47:45,835 --> 01:47:48,296
Come to me, Maxwell, come to me.
Plugged in there.

1565
01:47:50,173 --> 01:47:53,676
-We're hot! We're livel
-Where are the mikes?

1566
01:47:54,552 --> 01:47:55,678
Mikes?

1567
01:47:55,762 --> 01:47:57,055
This doesn't work without mikes,
Simmons.

1568
01:47:57,138 --> 01:47:58,723
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1569
01:47:58,806 --> 01:48:00,350
Let's find them.

1570
01:48:00,433 --> 01:48:01,934
Kid, get in the chair!
Just get in the chair, all right?

1571
01:48:02,018 --> 01:48:04,187
-Okay, I'll sit. I'll sit.
-They steal everything out of this place.

1572
01:48:04,270 --> 01:48:07,357
How do we get the signal out?
How do we call the Air Force?

1573
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:08,775
-Glen?
-Huh?

1574
01:48:08,858 --> 01:48:12,362
Can you hotwire this computer to
transmit a tone through the radio?

1575
01:48:12,445 --> 01:48:13,488
What good is that?

1576
01:48:13,571 --> 01:48:15,990
Morse code! You can use this
to transmit it through that!

1577
01:48:16,074 --> 01:48:19,661
Okay, I'll do it! Turn it around.
Okay, let's see.

1578
01:48:19,744 --> 01:48:21,579
Simmons, | need a screwdriver!

1579
01:48:33,341 --> 01:48:34,884
There's Optimus.

1580
01:48:52,819 --> 01:48:54,320
Almost done.

1581
01:48:56,114 --> 01:48:58,074
What the hell was that?

1582
01:49:01,119 --> 01:49:02,829
Barricade the door!

1583
01:49:05,540 --> 01:49:07,959
-Get something.
-Watch out!

1584
01:49:08,042 --> 01:49:10,128
Six, five, four, six, three.

1585
01:49:14,799 --> 01:49:17,176
Here! Put some rounds in!

1586
01:49:20,012 --> 01:49:21,472
Master search.

1587
01:49:22,348 --> 01:49:24,392
| got it! We're transmitting!

1588
01:49:24,475 --> 01:49:25,643
Send exactly what | say!

1589
01:49:25,727 --> 01:49:29,856
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!
Burn, you little sucker! Burn!

1590
01:49:29,939 --> 01:49:33,985
"This is Defense Secretary Keller.
Get me NORTHCOM commander."

1591
01:49:34,068 --> 01:49:35,653
-Whoal
-Whoa!

1592
01:49:37,280 --> 01:49:38,364
What was that?

1593
01:49:38,448 --> 01:49:41,325
Authenticate emergency action.
Blackbird 1195...

1594
01:49:43,453 --> 01:49:45,538
Sir, | have an authenticated
air strike order from Sec Def.

1595
01:50:10,354 --> 01:50:12,356
-No, no, no, no, no.
-What?

1596
01:50:12,440 --> 01:50:15,902
It's the same cop!
Block them, block them, block them.

1597
01:50:37,048 --> 01:50:38,174
Oh, my God.

1598
01:51:06,661 --> 01:51:08,037
Cool, Mom!

1599
01:51:33,896 --> 01:51:35,940
This is so not good.

1600
01:51:54,375 --> 01:51:56,294
He's behind the pillar!

1601
01:52:02,133 --> 01:52:05,261
-Shoot that mother...
-Maggie, cover fire!

1602
01:52:08,306 --> 01:52:10,725
It's the Air Force! They're responding!

1603
01:52:14,562 --> 01:52:16,564
Sucker, burn!

1604
01:52:22,320 --> 01:52:23,654
Oh, shit!

1605
01:52:23,988 --> 01:52:25,990
Yes! They're sending F-22s to the city!

1606
01:52:27,158 --> 01:52:29,285
Raptors, let's scramble,
scramble, scramble.

1607
01:52:30,453 --> 01:52:32,747
Strike and Dark Star roll call.

1608
01:52:34,999 --> 01:52:36,500
Looking out the right side.

1609
01:52:37,418 --> 01:52:39,629
Push to Kill Box One Alpha...

1610
01:52:47,178 --> 01:52:50,765
-Come on, let's go! Mount up!
-Move out! Move out! Go! Go!

1611
01:52:50,848 --> 01:52:53,017
Here, | got shortwave radios.

1612
01:52:53,517 --> 01:52:55,770
Wait. What am | supposed to
do with these?

1613
01:52:55,853 --> 01:52:58,189
Well, use them! It's all we got!

1614
01:52:58,522 --> 01:53:01,609
This is like RadioShack dinosaur radios
or something, man.

1615
01:53:01,692 --> 01:53:04,612
I'm only gonna get 20 or 30 miles
out of these things.

1616
01:53:04,695 --> 01:53:07,448
Are there any aircraft orbiting the city?

1617
01:53:08,032 --> 01:53:09,617
F-22 at 12:00.

1618
01:53:09,700 --> 01:53:12,453
All right, | want planes for air cover
and get Black Hawks on station

1619
01:53:12,536 --> 01:53:14,372
to extract that Cube. You got it?

1620
01:53:16,874 --> 01:53:19,335
Air Force has arrived! Pop smoke!

1621
01:53:19,543 --> 01:53:21,212
Raptor, Raptor, do you copy?

1622
01:53:22,505 --> 01:53:23,714
We have you visual.

1623
01:53:25,341 --> 01:53:26,717
Green smoke is the mark.

1624
01:53:26,801 --> 01:53:30,221
Provide air cover and vector
Black Hawks for extraction.

1625
01:53:34,892 --> 01:53:36,894
It's Starscream!

1626
01:53:37,311 --> 01:53:39,021
Please tell me you copy.

1627
01:53:39,313 --> 01:53:41,649
Back up! Take cover! Bumblebee!

1628
01:53:45,403 --> 01:53:47,405
No, no, no, no, no! Move!

1629
01:53:47,530 --> 01:53:50,658
-Back up! Back up!
-Retreat! Fall back!

1630
01:53:50,741 --> 01:53:52,034
Incoming!

1631
01:54:17,101 --> 01:54:18,936
Anybody hurt? Everyone okay?

1632
01:54:19,020 --> 01:54:20,438
Clear the area!

1633
01:54:26,277 --> 01:54:27,778
Oh, my God.

1634
01:54:28,612 --> 01:54:31,574
Bumblebee? No. Your legs!

1635
01:54:31,949 --> 01:54:33,284
Your legs.

1636
01:54:34,869 --> 01:54:38,539
Here. Here, back, back, back, back!
You all right?

1637
01:54:40,041 --> 01:54:42,460
Please get up. Bumblebee? Get up!

1638
01:54:44,045 --> 01:54:45,296
Ratchet!

1639
01:54:47,131 --> 01:54:48,632
-What the hell was that?
-What are you talking about?

1640
01:54:48,716 --> 01:54:50,634
What do you mean, what am
| talking about? They shot at us!

1641
01:54:50,760 --> 01:54:53,137
F-22 pilots would never fly
below buildings.

1642
01:54:53,220 --> 01:54:55,389
That's alien. That ain't friendly!

1643
01:54:55,473 --> 01:54:58,309
You got to get up. You're okay.
You're okay.

1644
01:54:59,477 --> 01:55:00,561
Come on!

1645
01:55:00,644 --> 01:55:02,813
Army Black Hawk inbound
to your location. Over.

1646
01:55:04,565 --> 01:55:06,734
Alpha 273 degrees, 10 miles.

1647
01:55:06,817 --> 01:55:09,153
November Victor, 1.2 clicks north.

1648
01:55:27,338 --> 01:55:28,839
Move out! Let's go!

1649
01:55:35,179 --> 01:55:36,972
Let's go! Move!

1650
01:55:43,521 --> 01:55:45,189
I'm not gonna leave you.

1651
01:56:24,311 --> 01:56:26,397
Come on, Decepticon punk!

1652
01:56:32,653 --> 01:56:34,238
Oh, my God!

1653
01:56:46,750 --> 01:56:48,711
Concentrate your fire!

1654
01:56:59,597 --> 01:57:00,848
Come on. Come on.

1655
01:57:03,350 --> 01:57:05,102
Megatron!

1656
01:57:09,773 --> 01:57:13,444
It's Megatron! Retreat! Move! Fall back!

1657
01:57:17,698 --> 01:57:19,366
Fall back!

1658
01:57:25,289 --> 01:57:27,541
Get our guys out of the way!
Get out of here! Go!

1659
01:57:27,625 --> 01:57:29,710
Get them out of the buggy! Move out!

1660
01:57:29,793 --> 01:57:32,046
We need air cover down here now!

1661
01:57:38,052 --> 01:57:39,470
Sam, help me with this.

1662
01:57:43,599 --> 01:57:47,937
-That all you got, Megatron?
-Come here, little cretin.

1663
01:57:48,020 --> 01:57:50,147
You want a piece of me?
You want a piece?

1664
01:57:50,272 --> 01:57:52,524
No! | want two!

1665
01:57:54,109 --> 01:57:55,527
What's going on?

1666
01:57:57,321 --> 01:57:59,990
Sirl That tank thing's getting back up.

1667
01:58:00,824 --> 01:58:03,118
Oh, these things just don't die.

1668
01:58:06,664 --> 01:58:08,165
Oh, we're so dead.

1669
01:58:08,290 --> 01:58:10,542
-Wrap it around the head.
-Sam!

1670
01:58:10,668 --> 01:58:11,752
Where's the Cube?

1671
01:58:11,835 --> 01:58:12,878
-Right there.
-Okay.

1672
01:58:13,003 --> 01:58:14,046
And take that and wrap it around

1673
01:58:14,171 --> 01:58:15,172
the base and then put it
around his neck.

1674
01:58:15,297 --> 01:58:17,967
-Okay?
-Epps, get those Black Hawks here!

1675
01:58:19,343 --> 01:58:20,844
That building.

1676
01:58:24,556 --> 01:58:26,392
-Okay.
-What?

1677
01:58:26,517 --> 01:58:29,436
All right, | can't leave my guys back
there, so here, take this flare.

1678
01:58:29,520 --> 01:58:31,814
Okay, there's a tall, white building
with statues on top.

1679
01:58:31,897 --> 01:58:34,108
-Go to the roof. Set the flare.
-No.

1680
01:58:34,191 --> 01:58:36,151
-Signal the chopper and set the flare.
-No, no. | can't do this!

1681
01:58:36,235 --> 01:58:40,656
Listen to me! You're a soldier now!
All right? | need you to take this Cube.

1682
01:58:40,739 --> 01:58:42,992
Get it into military hands
while we hold them off,

1683
01:58:43,075 --> 01:58:45,160
or a lot of people are gonna die.

1684
01:58:45,244 --> 01:58:46,787
-You got to go. You got to go.
-No, I'm not leaving.

1685
01:58:46,870 --> 01:58:48,080
-You need to go. Go.
-No, I'm not leaving

1686
01:58:48,205 --> 01:58:50,874
till 1 get Bumblebee out of here, okay?

1687
01:58:52,334 --> 01:58:53,419
Army Black Hawk requested.

1688
01:58:53,544 --> 01:58:56,046
Immediate evac for civilian boy
with precious cargo.

1689
01:58:56,171 --> 01:58:58,674
Headed to rooftop marked by flare.

1690
01:58:58,757 --> 01:59:01,885
-Sam, we will protect you.
-Okay.

1691
01:59:03,429 --> 01:59:06,849
-Epps, where are those planes?
-Sam!

1692
01:59:10,769 --> 01:59:14,940
No matter what happens,
I'm really glad | got in that car with you.

1693
01:59:18,193 --> 01:59:20,821
Sam! Get to the building! Move!

1694
01:59:20,904 --> 01:59:24,199
-Decepticons, attack!
-Hit it!

1695
01:59:26,869 --> 01:59:29,038
-Cover fire!
-Move to cover!

1696
01:59:35,419 --> 01:59:36,754
\Watch out!

1697
01:59:42,301 --> 01:59:45,346
-Girl, get that tow truck out of here!
-I'm going! I'm going!

1698
01:59:45,429 --> 01:59:47,139
Get out of here now!

1699
02:00:14,958 --> 02:00:16,126
Megatron!

1700
02:00:16,251 --> 02:00:17,419
Prime.

1701
02:00:43,153 --> 02:00:45,239
Humans don't deserve to live.

1702
02:00:45,322 --> 02:00:48,033
They deserve to choose for themselves.

1703
02:00:48,450 --> 02:00:50,828
Then you will die with them!

1704
02:00:56,500 --> 02:00:58,961
Join them in extinction!

1705
02:01:18,147 --> 02:01:19,815
Keep moving, Sam!

1706
02:01:20,816 --> 02:01:22,192
Don't stop!

1707
02:01:54,391 --> 02:01:56,518
Sam, get to the building!

1708
02:02:04,401 --> 02:02:06,570
Give me that Cube, boy!

1709
02:02:19,124 --> 02:02:21,293
Did that jerk just dent my car?

1710
02:02:42,606 --> 02:02:46,109
You're not gonna get me.
You're not gonna get me!

1711
02:02:51,406 --> 02:02:54,576
| smell you, boy!

1712
02:03:06,755 --> 02:03:07,965
Maggot!

1713
02:03:26,900 --> 02:03:28,527
Oh, no!

1714
02:03:53,051 --> 02:03:54,928
RN\ EIR o1V K ale0 M

1715
02:04:15,866 --> 02:04:17,200
This isn't going well!

1716
02:04:17,284 --> 02:04:18,702
Shoot! Shoot!

1717
02:05:04,498 --> 02:05:05,791
Nice shot.

1718
02:05:05,916 --> 02:05:09,336
-That tank is definitely dead now.
-All right, let's go! We got business!

1719
02:05:24,351 --> 02:05:27,813
Hey! I'm over here!

1720
02:05:40,117 --> 02:05:41,868
We've got the boy.

1721
02:05:46,456 --> 02:05:47,874
\Watch out!

1722
02:05:48,208 --> 02:05:49,459
WIIS3=

1723
02:05:59,886 --> 02:06:01,388
Hang on, Sam!

1724
02:06:10,063 --> 02:06:11,440
No! No!

1725
02:06:17,112 --> 02:06:22,200
Is it fear or courage
that compels you, fleshling?

1726
02:06:35,714 --> 02:06:37,215
Where do | go?

1727
02:06:38,508 --> 02:06:42,512
Give me the All Spark
and you may live to be my pet.

1728
02:06:43,764 --> 02:06:45,432
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1729
02:06:49,603 --> 02:06:52,063
I'm never giving you this All Spark!

1730
02:06:52,147 --> 02:06:54,983
Oh, so unwise.

1731
02:07:06,912 --> 02:07:08,455
| got you, boy.

1732
02:07:10,207 --> 02:07:12,042
Hold on to the Cube!

1733
02:07:31,686 --> 02:07:34,606
-Oh, no. Oh, no!
S DITe N oo

1734
02:07:39,569 --> 02:07:40,654
Sam?

1735
02:07:44,866 --> 02:07:48,161
You risked your life to protect the Cube.

1736
02:07:48,829 --> 02:07:50,330
No sacrifice,

1737
02:07:51,665 --> 02:07:54,793
-no victory.
-If | cannot defeat Megatron,

1738
02:07:55,085 --> 02:07:57,629
you must push the Cube into my chest.

1739
02:07:58,004 --> 02:08:01,216
| will sacrifice myself to destroy it.

1740
02:08:01,675 --> 02:08:03,176
Get behind me.

1741
02:08:04,845 --> 02:08:07,430
It's you and me, Megatron.

1742
02:08:07,514 --> 02:08:10,475
No, it's just me, Prime.

1743
02:08:12,853 --> 02:08:18,024
At the end of this day,
one shall stand, one shall fall.

1744
02:08:23,405 --> 02:08:28,285
You still fight for the weak!
That is why you lose!

1745
02:08:47,387 --> 02:08:49,848
Fighter jets in 60 seconds.

1746
02:08:49,931 --> 02:08:52,392
We got friendlies mixed with bad guys.
Targets will be marked.

1747
02:08:52,475 --> 02:08:53,560
Hey.

1748
02:08:54,728 --> 02:08:56,897
Bring the rain. All right?

1749
02:08:57,272 --> 02:08:59,316
All right, let's kill these things.

1750
02:09:01,234 --> 02:09:02,861
-Move, move, move!
-Remember, aim low.

1751
02:09:02,944 --> 02:09:04,946
Armor's weak under the chest.

1752
02:09:14,998 --> 02:09:16,583
Target marked. Still waiting.

1753
02:09:16,666 --> 02:09:18,752
Time on target, 20 seconds.

1754
02:09:25,634 --> 02:09:27,761
F-22s, we're still waiting.

1755
02:09:32,974 --> 02:09:34,434
Move out!

1756
02:09:37,646 --> 02:09:38,939
Incoming!

1757
02:09:47,447 --> 02:09:49,574
Weapons armed. Status green.

1758
02:10:08,176 --> 02:10:10,053
Run! Move!

1759
02:10:17,519 --> 02:10:19,104
Second wave's on approach.

1760
02:10:22,565 --> 02:10:24,192
What is that? Break off!

1761
02:10:24,275 --> 02:10:26,778
-Copy.
-It's either a massive amount of...

1762
02:10:35,495 --> 02:10:37,664
Two, get a lock! Pop that guy!

1763
02:10:41,710 --> 02:10:43,753
Stay on him. Keep him in your sights.

1764
02:10:44,087 --> 02:10:45,505
Take him out!

1765
02:10:59,686 --> 02:11:01,062
Two's down!

1766
02:11:10,447 --> 02:11:12,449
I'll kill you!

1767
02:11:12,532 --> 02:11:15,285
Mine! All Spark!

1768
02:11:16,244 --> 02:11:19,122
Sam! Put the Cube in my chest! Now!

1769
02:11:21,708 --> 02:11:22,959
No, Sam!

1770
02:11:48,735 --> 02:11:49,944
Hold up.

1771
02:11:52,989 --> 02:11:55,992
You left me no choice, brother.

1772
02:12:05,585 --> 02:12:08,505
Sam, | owe you my life.

1773
02:12:09,589 --> 02:12:11,341
We are in your debt.

1774
02:12:30,860 --> 02:12:33,279
Prime, we couldn't save him.

1775
02:12:34,114 --> 02:12:35,448
Jazz.

1776
02:12:38,618 --> 02:12:40,870
We lost a great comrade

1777
02:12:42,163 --> 02:12:44,040
but gained new ones.

1778
02:12:44,290 --> 02:12:46,626
Thank you, all of you.

1779
02:12:46,960 --> 02:12:49,337
You honor us with your bravery.

1780
02:12:50,338 --> 02:12:52,340
Permission to speak, sir?

1781
02:12:52,799 --> 02:12:55,718
Permission granted, old friend.

1782
02:12:55,802 --> 02:12:57,303
You speak now?

1783
02:12:58,179 --> 02:13:00,306
| wish to stay with the boy.

1784
02:13:01,141 --> 02:13:03,017
If that is his choice.

1785
02:13:07,897 --> 02:13:09,065
V=13

1786
02:13:29,586 --> 02:13:34,382
Gentlemen, the President has ordered
Sector Seven be terminated

1787
02:13:34,883 --> 02:13:37,927
and the remains of the dead aliens
disposed of.

1788
02:13:38,553 --> 02:13:41,848
The Laurentian Abyss is
seven miles below sea level,

1789
02:13:41,931 --> 02:13:44,100
deepest place on our planet.

1790
02:13:44,267 --> 02:13:47,854
The massive depth and pressure there,
coupled with subfreezing temperatures,

1791
02:13:47,937 --> 02:13:50,190
would crush and entomb them,

1792
02:13:51,941 --> 02:13:53,693
leaving no evidence.

1793
02:14:00,283 --> 02:14:04,746
With the All Spark gone,
we cannot return life to our planet.

1794
02:14:06,456 --> 02:14:09,083
And fate has yielded its reward,

1795
02:14:10,585 --> 02:14:13,546
a hew world to call home.

1796
02:14:19,761 --> 02:14:23,973
We live among its people now,
hiding in plain sight,

1797
02:14:24,098 --> 02:14:26,893
but watching over them In secret,

1798
02:14:27,101 --> 02:14:29,729
waiting, protecting.

1799
02:14:31,064 --> 02:14:34,150
| have witnessed
their capacity for courage.

1800
02:14:34,734 --> 02:14:37,737
And though we are worlds apart,

1801
02:14:37,820 --> 02:14:42,784
like us, there's more to them
than meets the eye.

1802
02:14:44,285 --> 02:14:46,829
I am Optimus Prime

1803
02:14:47,163 --> 02:14:50,583
and | send this message
to any surviving Autobots

1804
02:14:50,667 --> 02:14:53,670
taking refuge among the stars.

1805
02:14:54,671 --> 02:14:56,464
We are here.

1806
02:14:57,006 --> 02:14:59,092
We are waiting.

1807
02:15:18,319 --> 02:15:23,366
Can you shed any light on the recent,
so-called alien activity in the area?

1808
02:15:26,369 --> 02:15:31,874
Do you know what? | think that
if there was some sort of an alien

1809
02:15:32,458 --> 02:15:34,377
-infestation...
-Yeah.

1810
02:15:34,711 --> 02:15:37,213
They, the government,
would be the first to let you know.

1811
02:15:37,297 --> 02:15:38,965
The government would let us know.

1812
02:15:39,132 --> 02:15:40,717
-l mean, this is America.
-Yeah.

1813
02:15:40,842 --> 02:15:43,303
You know, that's how we know
we live in a free land,

1814
02:15:43,386 --> 02:15:44,971
because there's no secrets.

1815
02:15:45,054 --> 02:15:47,223
They'd say, "Hey! Duck and cover."

1816
02:15:57,233 --> 02:16:00,570
Your head is kind of a different size
than it is on television.
