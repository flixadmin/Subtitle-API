00:00:01,711 --> 00:00:03,147
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

2
00:00:03,171 --> 00:00:05,048
<i>Vibe must live again.</i>

3
00:00:05,131 --> 00:00:07,759
I am no longer Nash. I am... Pariah.

4
00:00:07,842 --> 00:00:09,219
<i>I freed the Anti-Monitor.</i>

5
00:00:09,302 --> 00:00:13,390
<i>And now I am forced to bear witness
as he destroys world after world.</i>

6
00:00:13,473 --> 00:00:15,975
<i>Oliver sacrificed himself
to create this new world.</i>

7
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:17,161
<i>Our earths must have merged</i>

8
00:00:17,185 --> 00:00:18,496
<i>when we helped Oliver
reboot the universe.</i>

9
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,313
<i>We all live on the same Earth now.</i>

10
00:00:20,397 --> 00:00:23,316
This is the same guy
that kidnapped your cousin Esperanza

11
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,710
<i>and turned her
into a meta-assassin.</i>

12
00:00:24,734 --> 00:00:27,454
The guy you questioned was killed
in the same lot you questioned him,

13
00:00:27,529 --> 00:00:28,445
<i>on the same day.</i>

14
00:00:28,446 --> 00:00:30,616
There's a major UV energy
coming off this thing.

15
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:32,659
<i>Looks like Team Citizen
has a new mission.</i>

16
00:00:36,955 --> 00:00:38,081
Come on in, folks.

17
00:00:38,164 --> 00:00:41,167
After five months of Vibaccinos to go,
welcome to the new Jitters.

18
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:42,752
Here you go.

19
00:00:43,586 --> 00:00:47,924
And remember, folks, CC Jitters
is here to stay, rain or shine...

20
00:00:48,007 --> 00:00:50,135
Hands in the air,
you foam-loving fascists.

21
00:00:50,218 --> 00:00:52,345
Are you kidding me?
We're already being robbed?

22
00:00:52,637 --> 00:00:56,391
Jitters just reopened and was
immediately attacked by terrorists.

23
00:00:56,474 --> 00:00:57,559
Why am I not surprised?

24
00:00:57,726 --> 00:00:59,310
I'll go bail out those latte sippers.

25
00:00:59,686 --> 00:01:01,604
<i>Guys, I got this.</i>

26
00:01:06,443 --> 00:01:08,695
You, open the register!

27
00:01:08,778 --> 00:01:09,821
Give me everything inside.

28
00:01:10,572 --> 00:01:13,158
Dude, we just reopened.
There's barely anything in there.

29
00:01:14,868 --> 00:01:15,868
Really?

30
00:01:16,327 --> 00:01:17,327
Yeah.

31
00:01:18,246 --> 00:01:19,246
Oh.

32
00:01:21,207 --> 00:01:24,836
Well, I'm gonna start
blowing stuff up, then.

33
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:46,316
Oh, crap.

34
00:01:49,986 --> 00:01:51,488
Sorry, I'm late.

35
00:01:51,571 --> 00:01:53,007
I love what you've done with the place.

36
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:57,452
Flash! Flash! Flash!

37
00:01:57,535 --> 00:01:58,620
Oh, stop.

38
00:01:59,454 --> 00:02:00,747
Stop, you guys.

39
00:02:18,556 --> 00:02:19,516
I'm sorry.

40
00:02:19,517 --> 00:02:23,103
Crisis is over. We beat the bad guy.
And you're still worried because...

41
00:02:24,562 --> 00:02:26,105
Because...

42
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:30,652
an infinite number of earths
experienced a cosmic heat death

43
00:02:30,735 --> 00:02:35,323
from which only one Earth was rebuilt.

44
00:02:35,406 --> 00:02:36,406
Hmm.

45
00:02:36,616 --> 00:02:40,495
So now, not only do Superman,

46
00:02:40,578 --> 00:02:43,414
Supergirl, and Black Lightning
live here,

47
00:02:43,498 --> 00:02:47,794
but, now, our entire timeline
has been rewritten

48
00:02:47,877 --> 00:02:49,504
so that they've always lived here,

49
00:02:49,587 --> 00:02:51,548
and I don't remember owning this shirt!

50
00:02:52,924 --> 00:02:54,384
Great shirt.

51
00:02:54,467 --> 00:02:55,787
Besides, isn't that a good thing?

52
00:02:56,052 --> 00:02:57,679
We're all one big happy family now.

53
00:02:57,762 --> 00:02:59,389
No!

54
00:02:59,806 --> 00:03:01,641
No! No, it is not.

55
00:03:02,392 --> 00:03:03,643
Not when these guys...

56
00:03:04,435 --> 00:03:05,895
...are crashing the reunion.

57
00:03:05,979 --> 00:03:08,189
Not a single one
of our doppelgangers survive

58
00:03:08,273 --> 00:03:10,191
to make it to Earth-Prime

59
00:03:10,358 --> 00:03:13,444
as far as I can tell,
but we did manage to pick up

60
00:03:13,528 --> 00:03:16,030
a butt-ton of bad guys, and aliens,

61
00:03:16,114 --> 00:03:17,323
and more metas,

62
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:18,950
and you know the best part?

63
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:23,621
The best part is a bunch
of our old villains are back

64
00:03:23,705 --> 00:03:25,874
with fresh paint jobs.

65
00:03:26,332 --> 00:03:28,126
When did you have time to do all this?

66
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:31,337
Eden Corps, the Top,

67
00:03:31,504 --> 00:03:33,089
Rainbow Raider...

68
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:35,717
Our Earth has more threats than ever,

69
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,720
and we don't even know
where they're coming from.

70
00:03:39,679 --> 00:03:40,679
What the hell was that?

71
00:03:41,431 --> 00:03:44,183
Pipes. Bad pipes. The heating.
Don't worry about it.

72
00:03:45,602 --> 00:03:46,686
Let me out.

73
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:47,769
Are you sure?

74
00:03:47,854 --> 00:03:50,356
'Cause it looks like
you locked Nash in the closet.

75
00:03:50,982 --> 00:03:51,983
No.

76
00:03:53,109 --> 00:03:54,402
Let me out.

77
00:03:54,777 --> 00:03:57,572
Okay, one of the auxiliary pipes
was leaking,

78
00:03:57,655 --> 00:04:01,492
so he's patching it up in exchange
for a crypto-circuit.

79
00:04:01,576 --> 00:04:02,702
Fine! Don't let me out.

80
00:04:02,785 --> 00:04:05,330
I'll let myself out, actually,
thank you very much.

81
00:04:05,413 --> 00:04:07,749
I'm gonna put
an Atlantean shoulder check

82
00:04:07,832 --> 00:04:09,876
into this door and bust right through.

83
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:12,045
- In three, in two...
- Okay.

84
00:04:12,545 --> 00:04:13,713
...in one!

85
00:04:19,135 --> 00:04:20,135
What's up?

86
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:24,432
Killer Frost.

87
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:25,558
It's just Frost now.

88
00:04:25,767 --> 00:04:28,287
Give me my crypto-circuit,
or I'm gonna punch you in the throat.

89
00:04:28,353 --> 00:04:30,647
I have your crypto-circuit,
and I could give it to you,

90
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:36,194
but I'm not really sure
what you'd need it for because...

91
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:40,198
you're an adventurer, so shouldn't
you be off somewhere adventuring?

92
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:42,325
Preferably, not here?

93
00:04:42,408 --> 00:04:44,661
Yeah, I mean, Gorilla City
is part of Earth-Prime now.

94
00:04:44,744 --> 00:04:46,024
Don't you wanna go myth-bust it?

95
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:47,079
No.

96
00:04:47,705 --> 00:04:48,790
Gorillas are atheists.

97
00:04:48,957 --> 00:04:52,627
Are you kidding me?
No, I'm gonna run tests on my dig site

98
00:04:53,086 --> 00:04:57,507
to ensure that nobody ever accidentally
reopens the anti-matter universe.

99
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:00,969
Run your tests.

100
00:05:01,344 --> 00:05:02,679
But I've already run tests,

101
00:05:02,762 --> 00:05:06,182
and that cave is staying shut,
so you're not really needed here.

102
00:05:06,349 --> 00:05:08,476
If you ran the tests,
then I'm really needed.

103
00:05:09,978 --> 00:05:12,397
What happened to Magenta? I liked her.

104
00:05:15,483 --> 00:05:16,567
Isn't it great?

105
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:18,611
It's still our number one story.

106
00:05:20,154 --> 00:05:21,406
Thanks again, friend.

107
00:05:23,366 --> 00:05:25,076
- Iris, hey.
- Hi.

108
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:26,619
I was running back from a car fire

109
00:05:26,703 --> 00:05:30,081
on route 119, and look who I found
on the way back.

110
00:05:30,164 --> 00:05:31,708
- Hey.
- Digg, hey!

111
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,085
How's the fam?

112
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:36,504
Oh! Everyone is very busy.

113
00:05:36,587 --> 00:05:38,881
Lyla just accepted a new posting.

114
00:05:39,132 --> 00:05:41,384
So, next week, we'll be taking the kids
to Metropolis.

115
00:05:41,467 --> 00:05:42,385
I heard.

116
00:05:42,386 --> 00:05:45,472
So shouldn't you be at home,
helping to pack boxes right now?

117
00:05:45,555 --> 00:05:46,555
Right.

118
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:49,434
But...

119
00:05:50,476 --> 00:05:51,477
Ah!

120
00:05:51,561 --> 00:05:54,355
Oliver's last will and testament
was read yesterday,

121
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:56,774
and he left something...

122
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,693
for you, Barry.

123
00:06:00,445 --> 00:06:01,779
Oliver's mask.

124
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:03,781
It's the original.

125
00:06:07,577 --> 00:06:09,495
This is the one I made him.

126
00:06:10,288 --> 00:06:14,500
Yeah, it's interesting because Oliver
was never a man given to sentiment.

127
00:06:15,668 --> 00:06:16,668
Hey.

128
00:06:17,378 --> 00:06:19,338
Do you see this?
Right above the left eye.

129
00:06:21,299 --> 00:06:23,801
Oliver hasn't worn this in years.
Why is there a mark on it?

130
00:06:24,385 --> 00:06:26,429
I don't know. Felicity skimped
on the dry cleaning?

131
00:06:26,679 --> 00:06:27,930
Or he left it on purpose.

132
00:06:28,014 --> 00:06:30,099
I mean, you just said it.
Oliver wasn't sappy.

133
00:06:30,183 --> 00:06:32,477
What if the mask is a clue
to some new threat out there,

134
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,579
something too dangerous...

135
00:06:33,603 --> 00:06:34,561
...to put in writing?

136
00:06:34,562 --> 00:06:37,774
Barry, you got all that
from a smudge mark? I don't...

137
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:39,567
Iris, what do you think?

138
00:06:39,568 --> 00:06:41,796
Um, that you two will have
to figure this out on your own.

139
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:44,256
I'm so sorry, babe. I gotta go meet
with this source right now.

140
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,491
Yeah, no, that's fine. Do your thing.

141
00:06:46,574 --> 00:06:49,077
Write your story,
and Digg and I can work on this.

142
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,328
We can?

143
00:06:50,828 --> 00:06:52,038
Can't we?

144
00:07:07,053 --> 00:07:08,054
Were you followed?

145
00:07:09,388 --> 00:07:10,388
- No.
- You sure?

146
00:07:11,808 --> 00:07:12,808
Yes.

147
00:07:12,934 --> 00:07:14,352
No. No recordings.

148
00:07:15,103 --> 00:07:16,854
The people you're after,
they know my voice.

149
00:07:18,064 --> 00:07:21,150
These people, you say you've learned
quite a bit about them,

150
00:07:21,234 --> 00:07:23,319
so you should recognize this, right?

151
00:07:25,655 --> 00:07:28,199
I spent 20 years working
for McCulloch Technologies.

152
00:07:28,366 --> 00:07:31,119
R&D department, classified division.

153
00:07:31,786 --> 00:07:33,329
And then this guy showed up.

154
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:35,164
He said his name was Malcolm Strombard.

155
00:07:35,498 --> 00:07:39,001
He'd been promoted into our group,
but he had no technical know-how.

156
00:07:39,961 --> 00:07:42,213
And last fall, I came in late one night,

157
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:44,382
<i>and I found him</i>

158
00:07:44,966 --> 00:07:47,969
<i>with the infrared photon rifle
we'd been developing for years.</i>

159
00:07:48,344 --> 00:07:49,345
<i>The next day...</i>

160
00:07:50,555 --> 00:07:52,282
<i>...he and the prototype were gone.</i>

161
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:53,933
So I started looking into it.

162
00:07:54,016 --> 00:07:57,770
And this man, Malcolm Strombard,
he doesn't officially exist.

163
00:07:58,354 --> 00:08:01,232
Of course, no one at McCulloch
believed me, so they fired me.

164
00:08:02,567 --> 00:08:05,153
The group that sent him
to steal that rifle,

165
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,405
they found out I was after him.

166
00:08:13,744 --> 00:08:15,246
How they kill their own men.

167
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:17,874
They have destroyed
way too many innocent lives,

168
00:08:17,957 --> 00:08:19,167
and they will not stop

169
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,878
unless someone helps us
bring them to light.

170
00:08:23,671 --> 00:08:25,590
Someone like you, Mr. Huskk.

171
00:08:28,384 --> 00:08:29,427
And I can stay anonymous?

172
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,721
No one will ever know your identity.

173
00:08:31,804 --> 00:08:35,141
I will do whatever it takes
to keep you safe, I swear.

174
00:08:36,392 --> 00:08:39,270
These people, they will not be
brought out of the shadows easily.

175
00:08:41,105 --> 00:08:42,481
<i>They live in the darkness.</i>

176
00:08:44,025 --> 00:08:45,443
<i>In the absence of light.</i>

177
00:08:51,616 --> 00:08:53,242
I didn't talk.

178
00:08:53,409 --> 00:08:54,911
I didn't talk. I swear.

179
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:56,609
<i>They call themselves...</i>

180
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,750
...Black Hole.

181
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,122
You're telling me that

182
00:09:22,146 --> 00:09:24,065
a secret organization has been operating

183
00:09:24,148 --> 00:09:26,442
in Central City for seven years now?

184
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:29,487
Yes, and, according to my source,
they have a name.

185
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:33,342
We've been
building a timeline.

186
00:09:33,366 --> 00:09:35,326
It looks like Black Hole's
activity started

187
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:37,370
just after
the particle accelerator exploded.

188
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:39,705
They've been abducting
and training meta-humans

189
00:09:39,789 --> 00:09:42,083
like my cousin Esperanza,
and potentially others.

190
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:45,544
And Black Hole's reach goes far beyond
theft and training meta-human assassins.

191
00:09:45,628 --> 00:09:48,256
They are also involved
in international arms deals.

192
00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:50,716
And they kill anyone they believe
has been compromised,

193
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,551
including our mystery man.

194
00:09:52,635 --> 00:09:54,112
He's now crispier
than the chicken strips

195
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:55,805
Allegra insists on ordering for dinner.

196
00:09:55,888 --> 00:09:57,515
Better than your vegan donuts.

197
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:59,684
Iris, have you told
Joe about this?

198
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:02,311
Yeah, I have, but Dad would have
to launch a RICO investigation

199
00:10:02,395 --> 00:10:04,480
to pursue a conspiracy like this.

200
00:10:04,689 --> 00:10:07,108
This is reporter territory now.

201
00:10:07,191 --> 00:10:09,193
Okay, okay. Look, guys.

202
00:10:09,819 --> 00:10:10,819
I get it.

203
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,364
There's nothing stronger
than a reporter's drive.

204
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:16,575
I literally can feel it
coming from all three of you,

205
00:10:16,659 --> 00:10:20,538
but as your legal advisor,
I gotta tell you...

206
00:10:21,497 --> 00:10:24,041
I think that running this story
is a mistake.

207
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,936
Iris, if McCulloch doesn't like
what they read,

208
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,420
they can sue you for defamation.

209
00:10:27,503 --> 00:10:29,383
I know. My dad was worried
about the same thing.

210
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:31,799
But that's a risk
that I'm willing to take, Cecile.

211
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:34,677
Guys, we don't even know
who's running Black Hole.

212
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,928
We're gonna find out.

213
00:10:36,429 --> 00:10:37,629
Yeah, she's right.

214
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:39,739
Reporters don't walk away
from the truth.

215
00:10:40,266 --> 00:10:42,685
Now I have a meeting

216
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:46,272
with the CEO of McCulloch Technologies,
Joseph Carver, in an hour.

217
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:49,400
So, let's see if he's willing to comment
on what's been happening.

218
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:52,987
But, either way,
be prepared to go to print.

219
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:56,407
We are running this story
with or without his comment.

220
00:11:11,714 --> 00:11:13,954
I know it's sort of like asking
the ocean to be less wet,

221
00:11:14,008 --> 00:11:16,088
but, Barry, do you think you could...

222
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,303
slow down?

223
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:19,072
Digg, you wouldn't let me speed you
to the crime lab,

224
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:20,407
so I had to speed the crime lab here.

225
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:24,268
Look, man, if Oliver really wanted you
to look into something,

226
00:11:24,352 --> 00:11:26,062
don't you think
he would've left you a note

227
00:11:26,145 --> 00:11:27,688
instead of some secret code?

228
00:11:27,772 --> 00:11:30,066
Oh, because Oliver never kept
a secret from you before?

229
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:36,447
There are sediment traces on the mask

230
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,449
usually found on islands
in the North China Sea.

231
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,243
- Like Lian Yu.
- Like Lian Yu.

232
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:44,497
Barry, there's more than one island
in the North China Sea.

233
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:48,125
Yeah, but only one with Mirakuru.

234
00:11:51,337 --> 00:11:52,773
Does that mask
really have Mirakuru on it?

235
00:11:52,797 --> 00:11:55,299
Anton Ivo's super soldier serum.

236
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:58,028
You really think there's
any of this stuff left on the island?

237
00:11:58,052 --> 00:11:59,428
Yeah, Oliver always thought

238
00:11:59,512 --> 00:12:01,365
that some samples
could have survived on Ivo's freighter.

239
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:03,867
And we don't even know what the state
of Lian Yu is post-Crisis.

240
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:05,726
If somebody got their hands on Mirakuru,

241
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:06,912
they could become a living weapon

242
00:12:06,936 --> 00:12:09,355
or replicate it
and build an entire army.

243
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:11,399
Digg, this is...

244
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:14,443
This has gotta be
why Oliver left me the mask.

245
00:12:14,652 --> 00:12:16,737
He wants me to find
the last stash of Mirakuru

246
00:12:16,821 --> 00:12:18,421
on Lian Yu
before it threatens the world.

247
00:12:22,076 --> 00:12:24,078
Look, I know you don't want me
to run you there,

248
00:12:25,121 --> 00:12:26,539
but it's a 20-hour plane ride.

249
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:31,502
That's too much.

250
00:12:33,838 --> 00:12:34,838
What you got?

251
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:42,596
My wife and I started this company
with three employees.

252
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,014
Now we have almost 3,000,

253
00:12:44,098 --> 00:12:45,698
but I still know
each one of their names.

254
00:12:46,225 --> 00:12:47,852
It's what Eva would have wanted.

255
00:12:47,935 --> 00:12:49,121
It's very thoughtful, Mr. Carver.

256
00:12:49,145 --> 00:12:50,271
Joseph, please.

257
00:12:50,354 --> 00:12:52,690
I'm a huge fan of <i>The Citizen.</i>
How can I help?

258
00:12:52,815 --> 00:12:55,067
Well, I have a source who can prove

259
00:12:55,151 --> 00:12:58,487
that one of your classified
photon rifles was stolen last fall,

260
00:12:58,571 --> 00:13:01,407
and it's now in the hands
of a secret organization

261
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,117
linked to terrorism,

262
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,580
kidnapping, illegal arms deals,
and... murder.

263
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:11,292
Do you care to comment?

264
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:14,938
Maurice, tell the board
I'm running a little bit behind.

265
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:17,840
Ms. West-Allen and I need to speak
some place a little more private.

266
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:19,299
Great.

267
00:13:27,266 --> 00:13:29,018
Your source, it's Gene Huskk, isn't it?

268
00:13:30,144 --> 00:13:32,688
I completely respect your need
to protect your sources,

269
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:34,082
but there's something
that you should see,

270
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:35,566
off the record, for Huskk's sake.

271
00:13:36,108 --> 00:13:37,193
Just a sec, please.

272
00:13:55,419 --> 00:13:57,713
Someone did infiltrate
the R&D division here at McCulloch,

273
00:13:57,796 --> 00:13:59,256
but it wasn't a secret organization.

274
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:02,718
It was Obsidian Tech trying to steal
one of our prototypes.

275
00:14:03,302 --> 00:14:05,387
But Huskk couldn't accept that.

276
00:14:06,931 --> 00:14:09,350
He became convinced
there was some larger conspiracy.

277
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,769
And the paranoia consumed him.

278
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,480
He became troubled,

279
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:16,440
started scaring other employees.

280
00:14:16,982 --> 00:14:18,210
I had no choice but to let him go.

281
00:14:18,234 --> 00:14:19,235
Mmm.

282
00:14:19,944 --> 00:14:23,405
But I can assure you that we have dealt
with this problem internally.

283
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:26,450
We just completed our investigation,

284
00:14:26,534 --> 00:14:28,494
and we're getting
a whole new security system

285
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:32,581
starting tomorrow,
new badges, new cameras, the works.

286
00:14:33,374 --> 00:14:35,292
There's no story here.

287
00:14:35,376 --> 00:14:38,963
Well, with all due respect, Mr. Carver,
I think that there is.

288
00:14:40,965 --> 00:14:43,384
Maybe it's just one that you won't like.

289
00:14:45,177 --> 00:14:46,178
Hmm.

290
00:14:46,637 --> 00:14:49,890
Ms. West-Allen, everything that I do,
I do in my wife's honor.

291
00:14:49,974 --> 00:14:51,559
To protect her legacy.

292
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:56,541
A story like this could really damage
our company's reputation,

293
00:14:56,981 --> 00:14:59,024
not to mention scare our investors.

294
00:14:59,817 --> 00:15:01,819
I'm asking you,
please, don't run this story.

295
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:05,948
I understand.

296
00:15:06,699 --> 00:15:08,576
You have an obligation
to your shareholders.

297
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:10,244
Thank you.

298
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:12,496
But...

299
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:14,665
I have an obligation to the truth.

300
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:19,128
You were robbed, Mr. Carver,
and I get that that's embarrassing.

301
00:15:19,211 --> 00:15:21,630
But the public deserves
to know what happened

302
00:15:21,714 --> 00:15:23,257
before anyone else gets hurt.

303
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:25,258
So...

304
00:15:25,968 --> 00:15:28,721
if you wish to withhold comment,
that's fine.

305
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:33,829
But I'm running the story either way.

306
00:15:44,695 --> 00:15:47,531
One hundred thousand views in one hour.
That's gotta be a record.

307
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:50,034
<i>Citizen</i> just fired
its first shots at Black Hole.

308
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:51,827
This is a cause for celebration.

309
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,495
- Ooh.
- Are you even 21?

310
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:59,293
I'd hold off on the balloons and bubbly.

311
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:01,086
McCulloch Tech just sent a memo.

312
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:03,172
They are suing <i>The Citizen</i>
for defamation.

313
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,601
- This is ridiculous.
- Iris...

314
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:17,311
"Fabricated statements,

315
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:19,313
deliberate omission
of exonerating evidence..."

316
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:20,814
Iris, something's not right.

317
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:26,403
Carver is just trying
to bury us in legal fees.

318
00:16:26,487 --> 00:16:28,113
He's just trying to scare us.

319
00:16:28,197 --> 00:16:29,197
Everybody down!

320
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:49,959
Why is someone shooting at us?

321
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,220
It's them. It's Black Hole.

322
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:52,930
Okay, we gotta go.

323
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:54,264
So they can kill us outside?

324
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:55,742
Okay, look, it's me that they're after.

325
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:57,118
Okay? So you guys get to S.T.A.R. Labs,

326
00:16:57,142 --> 00:16:58,411
I will make my way out
through Nash's tunnels.

327
00:16:58,435 --> 00:17:00,145
No way. We're not leaving you.

328
00:17:00,229 --> 00:17:02,648
Look, I have to make sure
that my source is safe, okay?

329
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:05,234
Once I do, I will meet you there,
I promise.

330
00:17:05,776 --> 00:17:07,069
Now we need to go.

331
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:08,570
On my count, okay?

332
00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:11,240
One... two...

333
00:17:11,323 --> 00:17:12,323
three. Go.

334
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:21,666
Go, go, go.

335
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:38,100
You're okay. Oh!

336
00:17:38,434 --> 00:17:41,228
- What happened?
- Black Hole tried to assassinate Iris.

337
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:42,938
She went to go find her source.

338
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:44,374
- Cecile went to Joe's.
- Where's Barry?

339
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:46,608
He's in Lian Yu.
I've been trying to radio him,

340
00:17:46,692 --> 00:17:47,794
but that place is a total dead zone.

341
00:17:47,818 --> 00:17:50,195
What about those clicky things
you guys use?

342
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:51,572
The extrapolators don't work.

343
00:17:51,655 --> 00:17:52,841
Now that the multiverse is gone,

344
00:17:52,865 --> 00:17:55,534
the physics behind breaching
has changed entirely.

345
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:57,995
But don't worry. Frost is out there
looking for the shooter.

346
00:17:58,078 --> 00:18:00,414
She should be careful.
Do you see these burn marks?

347
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:03,625
Whoever tried to kill us
was using high-intensity light.

348
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,502
Holy crap.

349
00:18:06,754 --> 00:18:08,505
I'm glad you two made it out alive.

350
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,840
Are you okay?

351
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:12,593
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- You're fine.

352
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:14,344
Good.

353
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:17,681
Why didn't you tell me
that they're in danger?

354
00:18:17,765 --> 00:18:19,892
I could've gotten them outta there.

355
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:22,036
Don't come at me, Nash.
I'm not here to keep you in the loop.

356
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,121
You're not even a part of this team.

357
00:18:23,145 --> 00:18:24,521
Oh, that's so hurtful.

358
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:26,791
How's your little team doing in the
standings? How's your little team...

359
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:29,234
Okay, see, this is exactly
what I'm talking about.

360
00:18:29,318 --> 00:18:30,986
No, you don't care about the team.

361
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:33,530
You only work with us
when you want something from us.

362
00:18:33,614 --> 00:18:35,741
No, keep me out of this.

363
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:36,824
So what is it this time?

364
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:39,912
You got a couple glyphs
you need Allegra to X-ray for you?

365
00:18:39,995 --> 00:18:42,581
Or maybe you just want to open up
another Pandora's box of hell.

366
00:18:42,664 --> 00:18:43,664
Are you kidding me?

367
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:46,835
I was the only one
trying to stop Crisis.

368
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:48,712
A Crisis you started!

369
00:18:48,796 --> 00:18:52,007
Billions of worlds,
trillions of people gone.

370
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,802
- Like they were never even born!
- And I paid for it.

371
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,595
As Pariah, I paid for it

372
00:18:56,678 --> 00:18:59,556
and still managed to help
defeat the Anti-Monitor.

373
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,267
Which did nothing
for the people who died.

374
00:19:05,604 --> 00:19:08,273
Oliver, Harry,

375
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:10,692
Jesse.

376
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:15,322
An infinite number of Harrison Wells.

377
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:19,484
And we're stuck with the one
who killed the multiverse.

378
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,300
Babe, what the frak was that?

379
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:40,055
Just making sure we learn
from our mistakes.

380
00:19:41,223 --> 00:19:42,423
Iris is still out there, guys.

381
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,869
And we need to figure out
who this assassin is

382
00:19:44,893 --> 00:19:46,478
before they get to her first.

383
00:19:52,818 --> 00:19:54,069
Thank God you're safe.

384
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:55,404
I'm not. Neither are you.

385
00:19:55,779 --> 00:19:57,489
Black Hole isn't what we think.

386
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:01,118
Oh, my God!

387
00:20:03,078 --> 00:20:04,078
Mirror.

388
00:21:03,138 --> 00:21:04,157
- Iris.
- Boss, you're okay!

389
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:05,891
Yeah, no, I'm fine, but my source isn't.

390
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:08,352
The person that tried to kill me
got to him first.

391
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:10,395
Hey, Cisco, where's that binder?

392
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:12,981
- Right here.
- Thanks.

393
00:21:13,899 --> 00:21:15,067
Where is it?

394
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:20,572
Her. Dr. Kimiyo Hoshi.

395
00:21:20,656 --> 00:21:21,657
Hoshi?

396
00:21:22,741 --> 00:21:24,076
She went missing four years ago.

397
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:26,495
She's an astronomer out of Tokyo

398
00:21:26,578 --> 00:21:28,538
with the power to fuel Starlight,

399
00:21:28,622 --> 00:21:30,749
but her meta powers
aren't precise enough

400
00:21:30,832 --> 00:21:33,335
to do the kind of damage
you showed me in those photos.

401
00:21:33,961 --> 00:21:36,630
What if she used
the photon rifle to focus them?

402
00:21:37,214 --> 00:21:41,468
Good thinking. Maybe the reflector chip
could condense her UV photon emissions.

403
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:42,552
The rifle is the weapon.

404
00:21:42,636 --> 00:21:44,012
Now she's the ammunition.

405
00:21:44,096 --> 00:21:47,015
So Black Hole turned her
into some kind of evil light doctor.

406
00:21:47,182 --> 00:21:49,685
So we've got a brand-new,

407
00:21:49,768 --> 00:21:52,854
more powerful, murder-happy Dr. Light

408
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:55,315
on our hands. Another new meta-surprise,

409
00:21:55,482 --> 00:21:58,652
- courtesy of Earth-fraking-Prime.
- Actually, you know what?

410
00:21:59,236 --> 00:22:00,194
Hoshi killed my source,

411
00:22:00,195 --> 00:22:03,741
but I managed to save some evidence
he gave me. Ow!

412
00:22:10,664 --> 00:22:11,957
Dammit.

413
00:22:14,418 --> 00:22:16,545
Hey, you should sit down.

414
00:22:16,628 --> 00:22:17,754
I'm fine.

415
00:22:17,838 --> 00:22:19,965
- Did you get hurt out there?
- I said I'm fine.

416
00:22:20,132 --> 00:22:22,551
Whoa, whoa! Call Frost, now.

417
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,781
- That was on the freighter?
- Yeah.

418
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:28,890
If there's anything left, it's in here.

419
00:22:28,974 --> 00:22:30,284
Open it up, man. Let's see what's in it.

420
00:22:30,308 --> 00:22:31,309
All right.

421
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:43,488
This can't be right. I searched
the whole island a dozen times.

422
00:22:43,572 --> 00:22:45,615
Take the win, man.

423
00:22:45,699 --> 00:22:47,492
- There's no more Mirakuru left, Barry.
- No,

424
00:22:47,576 --> 00:22:48,994
Oliver's mask, it's a warning.

425
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:50,369
Or...

426
00:22:51,121 --> 00:22:53,999
maybe this is exactly what it was
intended to be in the first place.

427
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:58,712
- A gift.
- No, man, no. It can't just be a gift.

428
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:00,589
There's gotta be
something we're missing.

429
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:03,091
What if somebody got
to the Mirakuru first?

430
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:06,094
- Really? And left the box behind?
- I don't know.

431
00:23:06,178 --> 00:23:07,637
Okay, I need to run more tests.

432
00:23:07,721 --> 00:23:09,139
Or why don't we bring in the DEO

433
00:23:09,556 --> 00:23:10,724
or call Felicity or Thea?

434
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:13,518
We can't just let somebody
create another Deathstroke.

435
00:23:13,602 --> 00:23:15,020
We have to stop this threat, man.

436
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:17,939
- I have to finish what Oliver started.
- Barry.

437
00:23:19,858 --> 00:23:21,151
Are you all right, man?

438
00:23:22,861 --> 00:23:24,446
Yeah, I'm...

439
00:23:24,529 --> 00:23:25,655
That's never...

440
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:28,784
I'm just frustrated, I guess.

441
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:30,786
Yeah.

442
00:23:32,496 --> 00:23:33,497
Yeah.

443
00:23:33,622 --> 00:23:35,499
Look, I think I know exactly
what went on here.

444
00:23:39,628 --> 00:23:41,909
Oliver and Thea came to this island
a couple of years ago,

445
00:23:41,963 --> 00:23:45,467
and they faced off with the man
who used to live in this cell,

446
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,469
Deathstroke himself, Slade Wilson.

447
00:23:49,221 --> 00:23:50,680
Oliver brought his uniform with him.

448
00:23:53,225 --> 00:23:56,394
Which is how he could have soil
and Mirakuru on his mask.

449
00:24:00,023 --> 00:24:01,483
It wasn't a warning at all.

450
00:24:04,986 --> 00:24:07,531
You're searching for a mission
that doesn't exist, Barry,

451
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:10,534
but no amount of search
is gonna bring Oliver back.

452
00:24:19,084 --> 00:24:22,921
That man sprinted
from crusade to crusade.

453
00:24:25,132 --> 00:24:28,093
But, Barry, life is more
than just the mission.

454
00:24:28,176 --> 00:24:31,096
Unfortunately,
Oliver learned that too late.

455
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:35,559
He wouldn't want you going down
that same path.

456
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,728
Oliver died
so this Earth could live, Digg.

457
00:24:38,812 --> 00:24:41,189
I have to do everything
I possibly can to protect it.

458
00:24:41,273 --> 00:24:45,152
Oliver died for more
than this Earth's survival.

459
00:24:48,738 --> 00:24:51,158
Oliver laid down his life

460
00:24:51,241 --> 00:24:53,535
so the people he loved
could live theirs.

461
00:24:55,871 --> 00:24:57,122
That includes you.

462
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:04,462
Life's a marathon,

463
00:25:05,172 --> 00:25:06,715
not a sprint, Barry.

464
00:25:07,841 --> 00:25:09,342
Slow down and enjoy it.

465
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:21,605
So,
Kamilla asked me to check on you.

466
00:25:22,522 --> 00:25:23,690
What are you watching?

467
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,757
<i>So my latest experiment jump-starts
my neurons. They're currently...</i>

468
00:25:31,781 --> 00:25:34,409
- Harry.
<i>- ...firing at 120 times per second.</i>

469
00:25:34,492 --> 00:25:37,120
<i>I think we can get to 200.
So, this is</i>...

470
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,498
<i>It's progress. It's real progress.</i>

471
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:44,085
<i>I'll let you know. Anyway, miss you.</i>

472
00:25:47,214 --> 00:25:48,757
He was regaining his intelligence.

473
00:25:51,051 --> 00:25:52,051
All of Earth-2...

474
00:25:53,011 --> 00:25:54,471
wiped out.

475
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:58,719
And he doesn't even know it.

476
00:25:59,851 --> 00:26:01,353
But that wasn't your fault.

477
00:26:01,436 --> 00:26:02,729
Wasn't it?

478
00:26:06,816 --> 00:26:10,612
When the Monitor gave me
my powers back for Crisis...

479
00:26:12,113 --> 00:26:14,449
I remembered how powerful I used to be.

480
00:26:16,618 --> 00:26:18,954
I can't help thinking that
if I hadn't stopped being Vibe,

481
00:26:19,037 --> 00:26:22,165
maybe I could have sensed
that first anti-matter wave.

482
00:26:25,961 --> 00:26:27,161
Maybe I could have saved them.

483
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:31,758
And that's why you've become so obsessed
with all the new threats.

484
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:36,429
You want to protect everyone
who did survive on Earth-Prime.

485
00:26:41,643 --> 00:26:45,689
Cisco, do you regret
taking the meta-human cure?

486
00:26:46,648 --> 00:26:47,732
No.

487
00:26:50,026 --> 00:26:50,944
Do you miss being Vibe?

488
00:26:50,945 --> 00:26:52,487
Caitlin, it's not that simple.

489
00:27:03,665 --> 00:27:04,791
I don't know.

490
00:27:09,129 --> 00:27:10,547
I don't know.

491
00:27:16,303 --> 00:27:17,429
You know...

492
00:27:18,638 --> 00:27:20,598
I think you might be
onto something over here.

493
00:27:23,685 --> 00:27:27,355
With all these new threats...

494
00:27:28,732 --> 00:27:30,358
changes to our reality...

495
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:34,612
we need someone whose job it is
to compile all of them.

496
00:27:35,488 --> 00:27:38,074
Somebody who remembers
the difference between...

497
00:27:39,367 --> 00:27:41,619
the way it was and the way it is.

498
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:43,705
Yeah, but...

499
00:27:44,497 --> 00:27:47,917
what you're talking about,
that can't just be done in a day,

500
00:27:48,001 --> 00:27:50,003
and it certainly can't be done
in some room

501
00:27:50,086 --> 00:27:51,421
in the middle of Central City.

502
00:27:51,838 --> 00:27:53,006
I know.

503
00:27:54,174 --> 00:27:55,934
But I still think
you're the man for the job.

504
00:27:56,551 --> 00:28:00,847
Besides, maybe some time
away from Central City will

505
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:02,766
allow you to figure out
who you want to be

506
00:28:02,849 --> 00:28:04,934
in this post-Crisis world.

507
00:28:08,063 --> 00:28:09,189
Yeah.

508
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:12,650
Maybe.

509
00:28:22,243 --> 00:28:23,953
There you go.

510
00:28:24,662 --> 00:28:25,663
Thanks.

511
00:28:26,164 --> 00:28:28,333
So, you gonna tell me?

512
00:28:30,043 --> 00:28:31,294
You're thinking...

513
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:33,128
of running the story.

514
00:28:35,673 --> 00:28:37,092
I know what I was doing, Dad.

515
00:28:37,592 --> 00:28:38,592
Really, Iris?

516
00:28:38,885 --> 00:28:41,304
Frost told me.
You have fifth-degree burns.

517
00:28:41,388 --> 00:28:43,556
My forensics guys have been
in your office for hours,

518
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,725
and they've found nothing.
There's no bullet holes.

519
00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:48,895
There's no casings.
If that assassin would have...

520
00:28:50,063 --> 00:28:51,314
murdered you today,

521
00:28:52,023 --> 00:28:53,733
I would have no evidence
to bring her in.

522
00:28:53,817 --> 00:28:56,111
Black Hole attacked my office.

523
00:28:56,194 --> 00:28:57,654
Dad, they nearly killed my friends.

524
00:28:57,737 --> 00:29:00,448
They murdered my source
right in front of me.

525
00:29:00,532 --> 00:29:02,742
He's dead because
I asked him to speak up,

526
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:06,246
and I have to honor that
by exposing each and every person

527
00:29:06,329 --> 00:29:08,873
behind this organization.
So, I'm sorry, Dad,

528
00:29:08,957 --> 00:29:12,585
- if you want me to give up, I...
- You know I wouldn't say that.

529
00:29:14,379 --> 00:29:17,424
But this organization
has been in operation for years,

530
00:29:17,507 --> 00:29:21,052
and their roots run deeper
than you have dug, Iris.

531
00:29:22,137 --> 00:29:24,347
You can't win this war in a day.

532
00:29:24,431 --> 00:29:27,267
Look, when you and Barry told me
that Crisis was coming,

533
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:30,520
I was determined to solve
as many cases as I could

534
00:29:30,603 --> 00:29:33,565
because God knows
how many days I have left

535
00:29:34,357 --> 00:29:36,025
to make a difference,

536
00:29:36,484 --> 00:29:37,819
but then Crisis came.

537
00:29:39,154 --> 00:29:40,154
Barry survived.

538
00:29:41,239 --> 00:29:43,366
So, now, I have to remind myself
every single day

539
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,994
that we don't live
in Crisis mode anymore.

540
00:29:46,077 --> 00:29:47,662
We have time now.

541
00:29:51,332 --> 00:29:52,959
So what am I supposed to do, Dad?

542
00:29:55,336 --> 00:29:57,130
How am I supposed to fight these people?

543
00:29:57,213 --> 00:30:00,049
First things first,
don't go charging to the front line

544
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:02,510
like you have nothing to lose.

545
00:30:04,053 --> 00:30:06,723
Now... Okay, your source...

546
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,058
Are you sure...

547
00:30:09,142 --> 00:30:12,312
he hasn't told anyone else
about Black Hole?

548
00:30:12,395 --> 00:30:14,105
No, no.

549
00:30:23,323 --> 00:30:24,323
Actually...

550
00:30:26,409 --> 00:30:27,660
someone else did know.

551
00:30:53,186 --> 00:30:55,688
- Did you sleep?
- No, I'm okay, Dad. Thanks.

552
00:30:56,022 --> 00:31:00,068
- How about a glass of water?
- Yeah, okay, sounds good. Thanks.

553
00:31:15,166 --> 00:31:16,209
Got you.

554
00:31:19,379 --> 00:31:22,465
Lower your weapon now.
We got you surrounded.

555
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:23,633
Put it on the floor.

556
00:31:26,678 --> 00:31:28,388
Pretty good Iris, huh?

557
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,390
Uncanny, babe.

558
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,936
Now it's up to the real one.

559
00:31:39,857 --> 00:31:42,443
Mr. Carver. Hello.

560
00:31:43,653 --> 00:31:44,988
Ms. West-Allen.

561
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:48,032
- What a surprise.
- I know.

562
00:31:48,658 --> 00:31:51,452
Reports of my death
were greatly exaggerated.

563
00:31:51,536 --> 00:31:53,496
Oh, careful.
There's a scrum of reporters

564
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,789
20 yards down the hall.

565
00:31:55,915 --> 00:31:59,502
Might not be the most convenient time
to call up your meta-assassin.

566
00:32:00,837 --> 00:32:03,840
That's quite the allegation to make
without any evidence.

567
00:32:03,923 --> 00:32:05,466
Oh, no, there's evidence.

568
00:32:06,134 --> 00:32:07,677
You gave it to me.

569
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,679
Your McCulloch ID.

570
00:32:10,555 --> 00:32:14,434
It uses a microchip
that reflects ultraviolet radiation,

571
00:32:14,517 --> 00:32:16,394
<i>and as your former employee
tried to tell me...</i>

572
00:32:16,561 --> 00:32:19,689
<i>...it's the same microchip
inside your company's reflector gun</i>

573
00:32:19,772 --> 00:32:21,816
<i>and inside Black Hole's badges.</i>

574
00:32:22,317 --> 00:32:25,153
Black Hole has been using
your optics technology for years,

575
00:32:25,236 --> 00:32:26,654
all while abducting metas,

576
00:32:26,738 --> 00:32:29,699
<i>like Esperanza Garcia,
who have light-based powers,</i>

577
00:32:30,408 --> 00:32:32,452
your area of expertise.

578
00:32:32,785 --> 00:32:35,622
You placed Malcolm Strombard
in Gene Huskk's division

579
00:32:35,705 --> 00:32:38,041
so that he could obtain the rifle
before it went to market

580
00:32:38,124 --> 00:32:40,001
and then place that rifle

581
00:32:40,084 --> 00:32:42,712
in the hands of the one person
who could power it,

582
00:32:42,795 --> 00:32:43,795
Kimiyo Hoshi,

583
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,923
your personal assassin.

584
00:32:48,176 --> 00:32:50,345
You weren't robbed by Black Hole.
You are Black Hole.

585
00:32:51,888 --> 00:32:53,931
And you've been using
McCulloch's resources

586
00:32:54,015 --> 00:32:55,683
to power a global conspiracy

587
00:32:55,767 --> 00:32:58,061
in meta-human trafficking, weapon sales,

588
00:32:58,227 --> 00:33:00,063
and murder for hire.

589
00:33:02,231 --> 00:33:03,471
Now, would you care to comment?

590
00:33:04,609 --> 00:33:05,609
I would...

591
00:33:06,486 --> 00:33:08,613
but I don't think you have
the whole story yet,

592
00:33:08,696 --> 00:33:11,115
because, if you did,
why would you be here trying to scare me

593
00:33:11,199 --> 00:33:13,576
while your family risks
their lives for you?

594
00:33:15,703 --> 00:33:17,997
Weapon down now!

595
00:33:29,384 --> 00:33:31,636
You're right.

596
00:33:31,719 --> 00:33:33,763
I can't stop Black Hole tonight,

597
00:33:33,846 --> 00:33:35,556
but I can't let you hurt anyone else...

598
00:33:37,433 --> 00:33:39,193
which is why I've set up
a dead man's switch.

599
00:33:39,769 --> 00:33:42,397
If I, my employees, any of my sources,

600
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,898
my loved ones die,

601
00:33:44,691 --> 00:33:47,193
all the information I have
tying you to Black Hole

602
00:33:47,276 --> 00:33:48,736
will be immediately released.

603
00:34:03,334 --> 00:34:04,544
Come on.

604
00:34:18,683 --> 00:34:19,851
Screw you.

605
00:34:21,686 --> 00:34:22,729
So...

606
00:34:24,021 --> 00:34:25,606
tell your friend to stand down.

607
00:34:39,245 --> 00:34:41,205
That's it?
You're just leaving?

608
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:45,251
I follow orders.

609
00:34:51,632 --> 00:34:52,818
- Mr. Carver.
- Mr. Carver.

610
00:34:52,842 --> 00:34:53,760
Mr. Carver.

611
00:34:53,761 --> 00:34:55,071
- Mr. Carver, a couple of questions.
- Mr. Carver.

612
00:34:55,094 --> 00:34:56,512
- Mr. Carver.
- Mr. Carver.

613
00:34:56,596 --> 00:34:57,656
- Just a few questions.
- A couple seconds.

614
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,800
Hi, thank you all so much
for coming. Here...

615
00:35:00,933 --> 00:35:02,536
Given new information
that has come to light,

616
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,520
I have decided
that McCulloch Technologies

617
00:35:04,604 --> 00:35:08,316
will be dropping its lawsuit
against Central City Citizen Media.

618
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:12,945
Any questions?

619
00:35:25,416 --> 00:35:26,416
Thanks for coming.

620
00:35:26,626 --> 00:35:28,169
- Hmm.
- I'm going away for a bit.

621
00:35:29,253 --> 00:35:31,130
I might not have my vibe powers anymore,

622
00:35:31,214 --> 00:35:34,675
but at least I can still do
some good old-fashioned footwork,

623
00:35:34,759 --> 00:35:37,011
so I'm gonna go...

624
00:35:37,678 --> 00:35:41,891
suss out whatever brave new threats
we might have

625
00:35:42,058 --> 00:35:44,393
to our brave new world,

626
00:35:44,477 --> 00:35:45,978
and I was thinking, in the meantime,

627
00:35:46,062 --> 00:35:48,397
maybe you could hold down the fort
here at S.T.A.R. Labs.

628
00:35:52,401 --> 00:35:53,569
Ah!

629
00:35:54,403 --> 00:35:55,905
Oh, you got cameras here?

630
00:35:56,364 --> 00:35:57,698
There's no cameras.

631
00:35:58,115 --> 00:36:01,369
- This is some kind of trick, right?
- No.

632
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:02,829
It's not a trick.

633
00:36:03,871 --> 00:36:05,331
It's more of an olive branch.

634
00:36:06,666 --> 00:36:07,750
Oh.

635
00:36:07,834 --> 00:36:09,335
I'm sorry I said those things.

636
00:36:09,418 --> 00:36:13,214
I should have held myself accountable
for what happened in Crisis,

637
00:36:13,297 --> 00:36:15,383
but instead I chose
to take it out on you.

638
00:36:18,886 --> 00:36:19,971
Anyway...

639
00:36:20,596 --> 00:36:21,597
So...

640
00:36:23,015 --> 00:36:23,933
Hitting the road?

641
00:36:23,934 --> 00:36:24,976
Yeah.

642
00:36:30,064 --> 00:36:31,649
So, while I'm gone,

643
00:36:31,732 --> 00:36:35,027
do your best not
to break anything, will you, Nash?

644
00:36:35,111 --> 00:36:36,713
Break everything
while you're gone, got it.

645
00:36:36,737 --> 00:36:38,337
It's like you're literally not listening

646
00:36:38,364 --> 00:36:39,764
- to what I'm saying.
- What's that?

647
00:36:48,666 --> 00:36:50,042
- Nash.
- Hmm?

648
00:36:51,836 --> 00:36:53,462
I hope you find what you're looking for.

649
00:37:29,457 --> 00:37:31,042
How was Lian Yu with Digg?

650
00:37:31,584 --> 00:37:32,835
I thought Oliver...

651
00:37:33,586 --> 00:37:37,006
left the mask as a reminder
to keep fighting.

652
00:37:37,924 --> 00:37:39,109
But with all the danger
we've been through,

653
00:37:39,133 --> 00:37:43,095
I guess, I kind of forgot why I made it
for him in the first place.

654
00:37:44,597 --> 00:37:47,767
It was so Oliver would

655
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:51,479
always remember
to protect the people he loved.

656
00:37:53,981 --> 00:37:55,566
That's why he left it to me.

657
00:37:57,652 --> 00:37:59,320
He wanted me to take my own advice.

658
00:37:59,946 --> 00:38:01,781
I have been in overdrive
ever since we learned

659
00:38:01,864 --> 00:38:03,240
that you were gonna die in Crisis.

660
00:38:05,785 --> 00:38:08,871
I have spent the last month
trying to live every day

661
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:12,041
like it was my last, hell-bent on...

662
00:38:14,418 --> 00:38:15,979
trying to make the most
of the limited time

663
00:38:16,003 --> 00:38:17,838
I thought we had left together...

664
00:38:19,674 --> 00:38:22,259
but Crisis is over now,
and you didn't die.

665
00:38:23,552 --> 00:38:24,887
And I think I just...

666
00:38:25,846 --> 00:38:27,848
- I forgot to...
- To slow down.

667
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:35,439
So are you also thinking
that tonight maybe we just...

668
00:38:36,524 --> 00:38:37,524
take it easy?

669
00:38:38,985 --> 00:38:39,985
Great minds.

670
00:38:41,028 --> 00:38:42,655
Beautiful minds.

671
00:39:05,511 --> 00:39:07,304
Oh, my God!

672
00:39:08,806 --> 00:39:10,016
Mirror.

673
00:39:27,992 --> 00:39:29,285
Eva.

674
00:41:42,418 --> 00:41:44,879
What were you up to, Eva McCulloch?
