I wanted to offer my sincere condolences
on your loss.

Your mother was a good woman.
She would have made a wonderful mayor.

I'd love to speak with Oliver.

Well, if you see him,
tell him he missed his own mother's funeral.

No one's seen Oliver for a few days.

I didn't even like Moira.

Terrible thing to say about someone
after they just died.

00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:50,420
In my defense, she was not nice.

00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,548
She was diabolical.

If Oliver's smart,
he ran back to his island to hide.

I was upset.

Just because I had a problem
doesn't mean I was wrong about Sebastian.

-I saw him at the reception.

92
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:42,444
And it struck me that the only reason that
he's mayor now is because Moira was killed.

Well, I'm the daughter of a cop.

And I know in my gut, Sebastian
is not the man that you think he is.

We're almost out of snake venom.

Seeing Roy like this reminds me of Barry.

119
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:19,833
And Barry reminds me of S.T.A.R. Labs.

120
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:25,839
S.T.A.R. Labs reminds me of the <i>Mirakuru</i> cure
that they're working on which we could use.

121
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:30,093
Yeah, especially since Isabel Rochev
was clearly injected with the stuff.

-You have any luck finding him?
-Tons.

126

All of it bad.

00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:51,656
There's been no activity on his passport,
cell phone...

128
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:52,949
...or bank accounts.

129
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:54,784
What's left of them anyhow.

130
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:58,913
And facial recognition hasn't spotted him
at any airport, bus or train station.

00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,125
Right. What about Sara?

132
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,835
Nothing either.

Don't go there, Felicity.

135
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,425
What if she is?

136
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,262
What if Oliver is?

137
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:16,639
Maybe the reason we can't find him
is because...

138
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:19,017
He's alive, Felicity.

139
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:23,229
If he wasn't, Isabel Rochev wouldn't be
so shy about rubbing it in our faces.

140
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:25,523
I hope you have some way
on how to find him...

141
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,777
...because I am running out
of places to look and people to ask.

142
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,404
I know who to ask.

Thought I made it clear
after our last meeting.

00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:48,254
As far as A.R.G.U.S. is concerned,
you're out of favors.

147
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:50,757
I'm not asking for myself, Amanda.

148
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,676
I'm asking for everyone in Starling City.

149
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:55,970
I need you to find Oliver Queen.

150
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:06,314
Dig. That computer
is running an XK-15 processor.

151
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:09,484
-Felicity.
-But that's not even supposed to exist yet.

152
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,569
-I want one.
AMANDA: Let me know what you find.

153
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:15,657
I don't have time to keep track of your friends.
We deal with more pressing issues.

154
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:19,202
-You don't understand. Oliver's disappeared.
-Maybe he needs some time.

155
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:23,123
Or is it possible that the two of you
haven't been looking in the right place?

156
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:26,501
-Did you try facial recognition?
