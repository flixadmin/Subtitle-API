00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,002
If we don't get home soon,

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:04,921
the sitter's gonna charge us
an extra hour.

3
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:06,839
We should have taken the car.

4
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:10,260
Sitter's what, another 15 bucks
for half an hour?

5
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:13,471
It's a bargain at twice the price.

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,101
Lyla.

7
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:19,269
Dear God.

8
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:20,978
-Alan.
-Sorry to crash your evening.

9
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:22,480
Then don't. Just call like normal people.

10
00:00:22,647 --> 00:00:24,149
I don't have a normal job.

11
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:25,650
And I've been compromised.

12
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:26,859
I'm not A.R.G.U.S. anymore.

13
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,736
Which makes you the only person
I can trust.

14
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:29,987
I need you to tell Waller...

15
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:31,198
-Get down!
-(GUNFIRE)

16
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,035

Are you okay?

22
00:00:56,889 --> 00:00:59,559
You were right.
We should've taken the car.

23
00:01:06,774 --> 00:01:08,110
Just be careful. Slow down, slow down.

24
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:09,736
Careful, careful, careful...

25
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:11,446
Do you want me to be careful?

26
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:13,531
Oh, this is more Oliver 2.0, isn't it?

27
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:15,367
You think being cute
is going to distract me?

28
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:17,119
Mission accomplished.

29
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:20,997
{\an8}(SIGHS) You don't have to wait on me
hand and foot.

30
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:23,291
{\an8}Though I wouldn't say no to a blanket.

31
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:27,379
{\an8}The doctor says
stick with the two tablets,

32
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:31,674
{\an8}keep with your current
pain management regimen.

33
00:01:31,924 --> 00:01:33,426
{\an8}You know, I really appreciate
what you're doing,

34
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,928
{\an8}but you have a city to save,
a mayoral campaign,

35
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:39,098
{\an8}a freaky super-bad
who can move things with his mind.

36
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:43,270
{\an8}None of which are nearly as important
as your recovery. Thank you.

37
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:44,687
{\an8}(CHUCKLES) I think the people in the city

38
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:46,731
{\an8}that Darhk wants to destroy
might disagree.

39
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:48,775
{\an8}Well, those people should know
that I stand no chance

40
00:01:48,941 --> 00:01:50,610
{\an8}of stopping Damien Darhk
without your help.

41
00:01:50,818 --> 00:01:52,279
{\an8}Well, you might have to.

42
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:55,448
{\an8}I have a spinal cord injury.

43
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:58,868
{\an8}I might never make a full recovery ever.

44
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:00,287
{\an8}That is worst case scenario.

45
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:03,831
{\an8}And either way, you're still
a vital member of the team.

46
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:06,293
Your superpower is right there.

47
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,922
Maybe my new codename could be Hot Wheels.

48
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:12,965
Keep pitching on that.

49
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:16,803
{\an8}All jokes aside, like you said,

50
00:02:16,969 --> 00:02:18,596
{\an8}what I do bring to the team is my mind

51
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:20,807
{\an8}and there's a lot on it.

52
00:02:20,973 --> 00:02:21,974
{\an8}So talk to me.

53
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,144
{\an8}I just don't think I'm ready
to come back yet,

54
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:27,605
{\an8}and the last thing you need
in a life or limb situation is me.

55
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:31,484
{\an8}Wow. We are going to agree to
disagree on that one for the moment.

{\an8}What's going on?

58
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:35,863
{\an8}John and Lyla were attacked.

{\an8}Oh, my God, are they okay?

{\an8}John was shot. Flesh wound.

00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:40,160
{\an8}I should go see them.

62
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:41,453
{\an8}We should go see them.

{\an8}I love you.

00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,838
{\an8}I love you, too.

67
00:02:58,052 --> 00:02:59,429
{\an8}And they just left you there?

68
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,348
{\an8}Yeah, but not before
leaving me with this.

69
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,725
We are sure that this wasn't HIVE?

70
00:03:03,891 --> 00:03:05,310
These men looked military.

71
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:07,854
Right. But you said
that Chang said he was compromised

72
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,147
and he specifically told you
to go and speak with Waller.

73
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,567
Knowing her, she had Alan
working on something off the books.

74
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:15,237
-I need to call the sitter.
-Okay.

75
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:18,823
{\an8}We need to find Chang before this
kidnapping becomes something worse.

76
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,783
{\an8}Yeah, well, the van didn't have
any plates on it.

77
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,911
{\an8}And Chang's phone is A.R.G.U.S.-issued,
which means it'll be untraceable.

78
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:25,788
{\an8}We could really use Felicity's help
right now.

79
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:28,833
{\an8}Yeah, she's not up for it yet.

80
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:32,462
{\an8}I can have SCPD see if John's bullet
is connected to any open cases.

81
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:33,630
{\an8}Yeah.

82
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:36,549
{\an8}I can go check the crime scene
for any leftover evidence.

83
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:41,053
{\an8}You should go to Starling General
and have that looked at.

84
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,805
{\an8}-I'll be fine.
-Why?

85
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:44,932
{\an8}Because eating a cheeseburger
is a better option?

86
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:46,643
{\an8}This isn't for me.

87
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:47,852

we're both full of surprises, Andy.

{\an8}-What do you wanna know?
-All right.

98
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:24,639
{\an8}How do you end up working
out of a basement or wherever we are,

99
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:28,059
{\an8}and fighting crime with a guy
who wears a green hoodie?

Well, he's a good man.
And we're not fighting crime, Andy.

that's been funding the local arms trade.

but rocks and sticks to fight us.

00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:29,801
Multiple lacerations to the knees,
a broken arm,

157
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:32,469
at least three pulled fingernails.

158
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:33,930
They were torturing him for something.

159
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:37,308
Information wasn't the only thing
they wanted.

160
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,316
I told you, what Agent Chang
was working on is none of your concern.

161
00:08:45,482 --> 00:08:46,734
It's even less of yours.

162
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:47,902
Thought that would change
once you found out

163
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,862
that Chang was mutilated,
tortured and killed.

164
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,699
I'm afraid you've over-extended
your welcome, Mr. Diggle.

165
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,701
Which is A.R.G.U.S.-speak
for "get the hell out of here."

166
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,953
You always were a quick study.

167
00:08:57,494 --> 00:09:00,915
I mean this with all sincerity,
your presence has truly been missed.

168
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:05,670
Even if I don't show it, I am deeply
regretful for Mr. Chang's death.

169
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,591
Hopefully we'll meet again
under happier circumstances.

170
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,217
Of course.

171
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,188
Hey, what was that look all about?

172
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:29,902
"Ketorolac. Possible side effects
include swelling of hands and feet,

173
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,613
"increased appetite, risk of infection..."

174
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,364
Oh. Good, good, good. "Hallucinations."

175
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:35,950
I really thought I was smarter than this.

176
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:39,370
You are not me
and you're definitely not real.

177
00:09:39,536 --> 00:09:42,414
I used to be you. Or you used to be me.

178
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:46,043
Strong, confident, brunette.

179
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:51,674
But you wasted all that away
to go play super-hero.

180
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,761
And look where that got you.

181
00:09:57,429 --> 00:10:01,267
Okay, so wait, this Waller person said
that she couldn't tell you anything

182
00:10:01,433 --> 00:10:02,935
and then gave you that flash drive?

183
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,479
A.R.G.U.S. has 24/7 internal surveillance.

184
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:08,107
She didn't want anyone to know
she was giving me what she was giving me.

185
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,442
The question is, what did she give you?

186
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,279
I've seen that symbol before.

187
00:10:13,445 --> 00:10:14,781
LYLA: <i>It's a logo, actually.</i>

188
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,908
Shadowspire is a US Army
Special Forces unit.

189
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:20,327
A.R.G.U.S. took them down three years ago
when they were exposed as war profiteers.

190
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:21,954
In an op run by Alan Chang.

191
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,580
What about those other two guys?

192
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,499
LYLA: <i>They've been reported missing
for two days.</i>

193
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:27,960
If those were the missing agents
that were part of Shadowspire...

194
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:31,463
Then the rest of Shadowspire's
gonna be on a payback mission.

195
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,133
We need to find the other two agents
before they end up like Alan.

196
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:35,802
Hey, I think I found something.

197
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,137
That logo that was on the flash drive
that Waller gave you.

198
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,305
Shadowspire.

199
00:10:39,471 --> 00:10:40,682
Thought I recognized that from some place.

200
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,308
I ran into a lot of those guys
back in the 'Stan.

201
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,310
I need to talk to my brother again.

202
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:49,523
You wouldn't think the reward
for confiscating an opium shipment

203
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:51,483
would be additional duty guarding it.

204
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:53,945
What'd you expect?
A kiss from the President?

205
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,906
How are my two conquering heroes?

206
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,742
-Wet and tired.
-We are good, sir.

207
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,953
-You gentlemen did good today.
-Thank you, sir.

208
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:04,246
You ever think of your future
beyond working in this hell hole?

209
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:07,541
I don't know.
Personal security, body guarding maybe?

210
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,211
You boys are meant for better things.

211
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,425
The three of us could make bank if a few
bricks of that sweet Afghani powder

212
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:19,303
happened to go AWOL before the morning.

213
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:22,639
You know, I'm gonna have to decline, sir.

214
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,434
My mama taught me
never to trust dirty war profiteers.

215
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,860
You should probably watch your tone.

216
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,696
You might end up in worse shape
than those Talis yesterday.

217
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:42,827
As you were.

218
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:51,002
-Well, look at you.
-What you talking about?

219
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:53,004
Back in Starling,
you would have jumped at any opportunity

220
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,131
to earn a little extra scratch.

221
00:11:55,672 --> 00:11:58,843
This place has been good for you.
Proud of you, Andy.

222
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:04,306
So exactly how many evil organizations
are you associated with?

223
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:05,557
I'm beginning to lose count.

224
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:06,976
What are you talking about?

225
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:11,397
Shadowspire. Your old army buddies
are in Starling City.

226
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:17,945
They tortured and killed an A.R.G.U.S.
agent and abducted two others.

227
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,114
Look, I have nothing to do
with them anymore.

228
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:23,617
After I get discharged, they cut ties.
They only want enlisted men.

229
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:27,663
How the hell could I not see this?
You were with me the entire time!

230
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,249
Because you saw what you wanted to see!

231
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,252
Look, you wanted to believe
that the Army had straightened me out.

232
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:36,505
Look, I'm your brother,
but I'm not built like you.

233
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:38,590
I didn't take to the military
like you did.

234
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:40,802
You saw the world
as something to be fixed.

235
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:42,761
I only saw it as broken.

236
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:45,722
So I made sure
I had enough to survive in it.

237
00:12:46,598 --> 00:12:49,936
So you pretended to be
a completely different person

238
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,145
around your own brother?

239
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,982
Spare me the look
that's on your face right now.

240
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:00,112
But maybe some good
could come out of this.

241
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,447
Andy.

242
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,283
What are you talking about?

243
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,828
Two missing agents.
You still think they're alive?

244
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:09,246
-I can hope.
-And I can help.

245
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:11,498
Look, I know how Shadowspire operates.

246
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,459
If they're consistent,

247
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,794
they'll use the nearest free port
as a base of operations.

248
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:21,092
The best place to hide illicit things
is right next to legitimate ones.

249
00:13:24,636 --> 00:13:25,847
SPARTAN: <i>It's called a free port.</i>

250
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:28,975
Holds commodities while they're in transit
between international destinations.

251
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,142
Pretty low-end.

252
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,519
Looks like somebody
upgraded their security system.

253
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:36,190
Motion sensors, laser trip wires,
digital locks.

254
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,567
I think I know somebody who can help.

255
00:13:39,526 --> 00:13:40,987
(PHONE RINGS)

256
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:46,242
Not gonna get that? Smart move.

257
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,371
Oliver?

258
00:13:50,537 --> 00:13:52,289
GREEN ARROW:
<i>I'm out in the field, actually.</i>

259
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:53,958
We've come up against some tech.

260
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,751
The kind that you typically eat
for breakfast.

261
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:59,171
Now, I know that you said you're not
ready to get back in the saddle,

262
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,007
<i>but we could really use your help.</i>

263
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,425
You're not really falling for that again,
are you?

264
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:04,718
Where are you?

265
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:06,803
Pacific Freeport, it's a...

266
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:07,972
Security's down.

267
00:14:08,805 --> 00:14:09,848
That was amazing.

268
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,893
<i>All you need to do
is to get back in the game.</i>

269
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,520
I thought "vomiting inside my mouth"
was just an expression.

270
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,814
I'm inside their security system.

271
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:20,276
I got eyes on seven
very menacing-looking fellows

272
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:22,486
<i>guarding a bunch of holding containers.</i>

273
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,826
Reading infrared in one of the containers.
I'm working on opening that lock.

274
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,828
Go for the hostages.
We'll take care of Shadowspire.

275
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:41,463
Container's open.
Should be 10 feet in front of you,

276
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,924
second container on your right.

277
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,550
Got it.

278
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:48,888

<i>We found the two A.R.G.U.S. agents.</i>

They're both dead.

281
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,561
-Get out of here then.
-What about you and Spartan?

282
00:14:55,727 --> 00:14:56,770
We got this! Go!

283
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,405
Felicity, what's going on?

284
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,116
I don't know. I...
I must have tripped some sort of failsafe.

285
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,243
The system's overloaded
with too many requests.

(CHUCKLES) Oopsie.

287
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:29,929
You hear so much about these vigilantes,
but I've never seen one in person.

288
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,181
Wish I could say the same
about a cold-blooded murderer.

289
00:15:33,765 --> 00:15:34,891
Have we met before?

290
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,861
Let's go.

00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,947
<i>I've got Spartan. We're good.</i>

No thanks to you.

Hey.

294
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,295
You okay?

295
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:06,048
That depends. Is John okay?

296
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,633
John's fine.

297
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:13,180
But you seem to think that
what happened tonight is your fault.

298
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,016
Well, I'm pretty sure I was the one

299
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:17,101
who couldn't stop the security doors
from closing.

300
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:18,477
And I'm the one who pushed you
to get involved

301
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,854
when you signaled pretty hard
that you weren't ready.

302
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:22,606
I wasn't signaling

303
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:24,816
that hard.

304
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:26,986
I'm sorry that I pushed.

305
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:30,990
I just thought
that if you got behind a keyboard again,

306
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:33,742
that things would just start
to feel normal.

307
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:36,537
I love how playing super-hero
is what we consider normal.

308
00:16:36,703 --> 00:16:37,788
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.

309
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,500
But there is no going back to normal.

310
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,045
-You know what I mean.
-I know what you mean.

311
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:48,507
What I mean is that
I can no longer be a part of the team.

312
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:53,429
Because of your injury?
You can't let that stop you.

313
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:55,181
Except it has.

314
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,683
Look at me, Oliver.

315
00:16:57,891 --> 00:17:00,852
I've spent the last week and a half
stuck in this loft.

316
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:06,525
I can't move, I can't drive, I can't walk
down the street and get a cup of coffee.

317
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:09,570
And if tonight is any indication,

318
00:17:09,736 --> 00:17:13,032
I can't do the one thing
that I'm supposed to still be able to do.

319
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,325
You just need to give it time.

320
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,498
Hey, talk to me.

321
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,376
Go ahead, tell him.

322
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:27,379
Tell him you're hallucinating.
That should go over like gangbusters.

323
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,340
I'm not going to pretend
that I understand...

324
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:30,716
Come on, Felicity, tell him.

325
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:31,925
<i>...what you're going through.</i>

326
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:34,511
Tell him that you're no good
for the team anymore.

327
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:36,555
That in addition
to having legs that don't work,

328
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,765
you've got a full on case of the crazies.

329
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:41,727
-We don't stand a chance to take down...
<i>-Hearing voices, seeing visions...</i>

330
00:17:41,893 --> 00:17:43,395
Would you just shut up!

331
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,860
-I didn't mean that.
-I didn't mean to upset you.

332
00:17:50,026 --> 00:17:51,362
No, no, no, it's not you, it's not you.

333
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,532
Can I just be alone for a little while?

334
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:09,921
You know, I guessed I hoped
by giving you intel on Shadowspire,

335
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,258
you would let me out of my cell.

336
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,385
But this isn't what I had in mind.

337
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,553
Hey, Lyla. It's been a while.

338
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,763
Andy.

339
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:26,647
Mr. Diggle. I'm the director of A.R.G.U.S.

340
00:18:26,813 --> 00:18:28,357
Those three dead men were my agents.

341
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:31,652
I wanna debrief you
on your relationship to Shadowspire.

342
00:18:31,818 --> 00:18:32,819
Which is interesting

343
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:35,030
because you couldn't even
say "Shadowspire" last time we met.

344
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:39,451
I was taking an understandable precaution
in light of a potential security breach.

345
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:42,538
The two agents you found tonight
were assigned

346
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:45,166
to safeguard a shipment
of confiscated railguns.

347
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:46,625
(ANDY SNICKERS)

348
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,796
But that was a completely
black assignment.

349
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,675
So I'd be very interested to know
how Shadowspire knew about it.

350
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,303
Amanda, you don't see
the bigger problem here?

351
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,805
Those things fire off
electromagnetic projectiles.

352
00:18:59,971 --> 00:19:01,557
Just one of them
could take down a building.

353
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:02,724
Your point?

354
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:05,436
My point is that if Shadowspire's
looking for that type of ordnance...

355
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:08,314
I'm far more concerned
with a catastrophic security breach

356
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,316
in my organization, Mr. Diggle.

357
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:11,817
ANDY: <i>It doesn't matter.</i>

358
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,486
Shadowspire's not after railguns.

359
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:15,821
And what if you're wrong, Andy?

360
00:19:15,987 --> 00:19:18,031
We thought you weren't hooked up
with Shadowspire anymore.

361
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:20,534
I'm not. But I know the way they work.

362
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,205
Shadowspire is all about misdirection.

363
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:25,914
An elite military unit?

364
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,709
A cover for a criminal organization.

365
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,296
A heist of a shipment of railguns?

366
00:19:33,129 --> 00:19:35,799
No. Distraction.

367
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,677
They're after something else.

368
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:43,849
(GRUNTS)

369
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:46,727
You wanna talk about it?

370
00:19:46,893 --> 00:19:48,019
What is there to talk about?

371
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:51,315
Felicity's upset,
I don't know how to help her,

372
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:53,859
it seems entirely straightforward.

373
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:57,821
As the only other person here
who's had the privilege of dating you,

374
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:58,989
a piece of advice?

375
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,491
Okay.

376
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:02,576
Don't be so hard on yourself.

377
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,536
Everything that's happening is my fault.

378
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,289
I knew you were gonna say that.

379
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:11,167
Last month, when we went up
against Vandal Savage,

380
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:14,129
Barry traveled through time
and changed things.

381
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,382
-What?
-Barry can travel through time.

382
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:20,176
And he warned me
that when you change the past,

383
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,553
the past fights back.

384
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:26,725
So for the past month,
I have been tortured by the idea

385
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:31,230
that what happened to Felicity
might have happened

386
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:32,439
because I wouldn't listen to him.

387
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:36,235
The only person who is responsible
for what happened to Felicity

388
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:37,486
is Damien Darhk.

389
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:39,405
-(PHONE VIBRATES)
-(SIGHS)

390
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:47,454
John. We're on it.

391
00:20:48,955 --> 00:20:51,542
John thinks Shadowspire's going after
a shipment of railguns.

392
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,585
-Can you call Thea?
-Got it.

393
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:55,587
Hey, Oliver.

394
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,758
Felicity, she makes her own choices,
you know.

395
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,261
And I'm sure that's one of the reasons
why you love her so much.

396
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,478
{\an8}Wow. <i>The Shining.</i>

397
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:16,149
Not sure if I should be flattered,
or insulted.

398
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,695
Oh, my God! God, just go away already.

399
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:20,946
Since I'm you,

400
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:22,948
that could be a little difficult,
don't you think?

401
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:29,621
Fine. I'm here. You're here.
So why are we here?

402
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,623
Do you have anything
the least bit interesting to say to me

403
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,249
besides these little jabs you keep making?

404
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,836
Well, those jabs
were just to get your attention.

405
00:21:36,002 --> 00:21:37,296
So what do you wanna tell me?

406
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:41,132
I'm not here to tell you anything.
I'm here to show you.

407
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:45,346
The last time we looked like this,
Cooper had just fake died.

408
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:47,055
What does this have to do
with my ex-boyfriend?

409
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:49,140
The day we thought he died,

410
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:55,481
you broke out the hair dye,
ditched the contacts and decided

411
00:21:56,231 --> 00:22:00,068
you weren't gonna rely on anyone else
for help ever again.

412
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,321
It was just going to be you
against the world,

413
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:04,323
and that was going to be your armor.

414
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:06,074
Guess I should've chosen Kevlar.

415
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:09,953
Stop it. Stop feeling sorry for yourself!
And stop pretending!

416
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,707
-Pretending?
-Pretending that this is the real you.

417
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:18,128
The blonde hair, glasses,
sensible fashion.

418
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:21,548
People wear masks for a reason.
To hide who they are.

419
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:24,175
Just like you have been doing
for the past five years.

420
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:28,179
First you decided to sign up for being
the world's most overqualified IT girl,

421
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:31,182
and then you decide to try being a hero.

422
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:34,019
And look what it got you.

423
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,147
<i>A ringside seat to the rest of your life.</i>

424
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,526
You thought you were such a badass.

425
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:52,413
So Waller says the shipment of railguns
is in the back of that truck.

426
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:54,372
Moving out in less than an hour.

427
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,793
What does Shadowspire want
with a whole shipment of railguns?

428
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:00,421
Absolutely nothing good.

429
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:04,215
It's nice to have you back,
Agent Michaels.

430
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:05,759
Feels like old times.

431
00:23:06,092 --> 00:23:07,218
What feels like old times

432
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:10,055
is you keeping secrets
that get good people killed.

433
00:23:10,221 --> 00:23:13,434
Did it ever occur to you that Alan and
the other two agents might still be alive

434
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,937
if you hadn't tried to keep your
anti-Shadowspire operations off the books?

435
00:23:17,103 --> 00:23:18,564
Of course it has.

436
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:20,857
But the ugly side of our business
is that sometimes

437
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:22,901
security has to be paid for in blood.

438
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:25,987
Thank you. I was wondering why I'd left.

439
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:29,074
I don't know
what you're worried about, man.

440
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,659
Your team's not seeing action tonight.

441
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:33,286
Yeah, and I'm not with them
because I'm here babysitting you.

442
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:39,501
Where are they?

443
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:42,504
Something's wrong.

444
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:02,398
There's no movement on the railgun...

447
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:13,535
Don't do it!

448
00:24:23,294 --> 00:24:26,172
Amanda. It's been ages.

449
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:29,676
Lieutenant Joyner.
Wish I could say it was a pleasure.

450
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:37,518
C'mon, man, stop moving.
You are making me dizzy.

451
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,481
Oh, my God.

452
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:46,777
I told you, John.

453
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:49,738
The railguns were a distraction.

454
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:51,740
A.R.G.U.S. is the endgame.

455
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:58,288
If this is retribution for the work Agent
Chang and I did crippling Shadowspire,

456
00:24:58,454 --> 00:24:59,956
clearly it didn't take.

457
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:03,376
Vengeance and retribution
are useless pursuits.

458
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:05,754
For one thing, they don't pay.

459
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:07,673
I'm here for Rubicon.

460
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:10,842
And you, you're gonna give me
the codes to access it.

461
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,177
You know I can't do that.

462
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,846
I do.
That's why I kept all these people alive.

00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:22,896
I'm gonna give you 20 minutes.

465
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:25,732
And then,

466
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,361
I'm gonna ask you again.

467
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:37,035
Damn it. They must have jammers in here.
No cell or Wi-Fi service.

468
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:40,706
Uh, would you like to share
with the rest of the class?

469
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:44,292
These monitors work just like TVs.

470
00:25:45,543 --> 00:25:48,839
Receiving broadcast signals
from the 700 MHz band.

471
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:51,633
I have a friend who's into
this kind of stuff.

472
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,176
Occasionally, I listen to her.

473
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:57,723
If I can just switch the chipset
into transmitting mode,

474
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:00,934
I should be able to contact my team.

475
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:04,605
Oh, man, Lyla does not have time to wait
on your team. We've gotta do something.

476
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:06,231
Yeah, well,
you're not doing anything, Andy.

477
00:26:06,397 --> 00:26:09,735
Look, man, your wife is in there!
Now is not the time to not trust me!

478
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,653
Come on, come on, come on.

479
00:26:19,535 --> 00:26:20,787
Son of a bitch.

480
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:25,333
Hey.

481
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,127
What, you just putting on
a little show for me, huh?

482
00:26:27,293 --> 00:26:28,754
Get your hands off of me, man.
What's wrong with you?

483
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,756
I see you buddying it up with Joyner.

484
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:32,423
Talking to him thick as thieves.

485
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:35,135
Would you relax?
We were talking about blackjack.

486
00:26:35,301 --> 00:26:37,553
I was telling him about the card counting
technique you taught me.

487
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:39,640
-Really, Andy?
-Yeah, really.

488
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,018
Okay, man.

489
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:45,979
'Cause I can't have you backsliding,
all right?

490
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:48,940
Man, I agreed to go through
this whole army thing.

491
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:53,069
And I kept my end of the bargain.
Now I need you to keep yours.

492
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:57,198
And I need you to start treating me
like a brother and not like a criminal.

493
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,785
Okay.

494
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:02,287
I'm sorry.

495
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:04,247
You're right.

496
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:08,669
John, Shadowspire never made a move
on the shipment,

497
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:12,422
so whatever their next move is, it...
It's not railguns.

498
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:17,635
Just call me when you get something
new from your brother. All right.

499
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:21,222
Oh.

500
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:24,600
I am so glad
our new lair has elevator access.

501
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:25,811
Hi.

502
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:29,022
Curtis has anointed himself
my personal chauffeur.

503
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:31,649
Fancy. It's a good thing
he didn't ask too many questions

504
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:34,695
about coming to your campaign office
in the middle of the night.

505
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:36,571
What are you doing here?

506
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,741
Well, I was at home

507
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:45,789
feeling more self-pity than I have
in my entire life when it hit me.

508
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:48,750
This is who I am.

509
00:27:49,625 --> 00:27:52,670
I wanted to come along
on your awesome superhero adventure

510
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:54,672
because I wanted to help people.

511
00:27:56,007 --> 00:28:00,053
And the old me was so angry at the world.

512
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:06,684
That anger never accomplished anything,
it just created more anger.

513
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:10,396
And some seriously bad
personal style choices.

514
00:28:12,523 --> 00:28:14,985
I wanted to do some good in the world.

515
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:16,903
(CHUCKLES)

516
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:20,782
-Ow.
-That was a good speech.

517
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:22,826
Thought you'd be a little more impressed.

518
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:25,411
It was a good speech. But...

519
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:27,873
But... How did it go again?

520
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,333
I know you, and I do,

521
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:33,586
you're probably thinking
what happened was your fault.

522
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:38,759
I'm here to tell you that it's not.

523
00:28:39,675 --> 00:28:41,762
And that it's not mine either.

524
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,346
It's the fault of only one man

525
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:46,057
and he has an extremely on-the-nose
and alliterative name.

526
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:49,269
And we're going to stop him.

527
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:54,482
Not out of guilt or vengeance or regret.

528
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:57,903
We are going to stop him
because it's what we do.

529
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:03,283
It's who we are.

530
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:07,620
-That was a good speech.
-Yeah?

531
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:10,040
I'm very happy to hear it.

532
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:19,007
We're gonna need to get some ramps.

533
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:27,682
{\an8}A.R.G.U.S. has been compromised.
And Lyla's being held hostage.

534
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:33,479
Found this in your office.
Hope you don't mind.

535
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:37,943
Lieutenant, we've picked up
an unauthorized comm

536
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,610
out of the detention area.

537
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:41,279
Take someone and look into it.

538
00:29:41,487 --> 00:29:42,906
Yes, sir.

539
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:49,745
Go on.

540
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:53,166
You might not get the chance
to enjoy it again.

541
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:55,501
It's been 20 minutes.

542
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:59,339
I'm gonna have to downsize
your organization yet again?

543
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:00,715
Apparently.

544
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,009
Well, that's rather cold blooded.

545
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:06,137
You really don't know her
that well at all, do you?

546
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:09,474
Ms. Michaels was one
of my most trusted agents.

547
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:12,435
She knows better than anyone
that I'm perfectly capable

548
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:16,189
of watching you execute
every person in this room,

549
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:19,067
and I'll still never give you
the Rubicon access codes.

550
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:26,491
Is that right, Ms. Michaels?

551
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:31,162
It's right. It's why I left.

552
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:35,500
Amanda Waller doesn't make decisions
based on the value of human life.

553
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:38,544
Pity.

554
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:40,881
No!

555
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:48,429
Well, Ms. Michaels, most trusted agent,

556
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:52,058
looks like you now have 20 minutes.

557
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:58,606
John.

558
00:30:59,565 --> 00:31:00,650
My God, no.

559
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:03,862
Wait, wait a minute. John. John. John.

560
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:08,699
John, please! He's going to kill her.
You can't afford not to trust me.

561
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,879
-Overwatch, we're onsite.
-Excuse me?

562
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:24,007
Well, I thought that it was time
you got a codename. What do you think?

563
00:31:24,174 --> 00:31:25,216
It's perfect.

564
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,260
I was gonna go with Oracle,
but it's taken.

565
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:30,221
Shadowspire's got the entire area
around C-and-C in lockdown.

566
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:32,015
<i>You guys are the only game in town.</i>

567
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:33,766
Can you get us inside?

568
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:38,438
Like that, you mean?

569
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:46,654
Well, it's about time
you guys came looking.

570
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:47,863
Who the hell are you supposed to be?

571
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:50,700
Sergeant Andrew Diggle,
52nd Regiment, 5th Battalion.

572
00:31:50,866 --> 00:31:52,953
-What are you doing locked up here?
-It's a long story.

573
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,913
Shorter version being my brother's a jerk.

574
00:31:55,621 --> 00:31:57,832
Lucky for me, though,
your CO and I go way back.

575
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,086
If you're serious about Lyla Michaels
giving up the Rubicon codes,

576
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:03,713
you will get on the radio
and tell Lieutenant Joyner

577
00:32:03,879 --> 00:32:08,259
the guy that taught him how to count cards
is here and wants to help him out.

578
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,855
Andy Diggle.
You look pretty good for a dead man.

579
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:22,607
And here, I thought I'd put on weight.

580
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:26,194
What are you doing at A.R.G.U.S.,
much less alive?

581
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:30,031
Amanda Waller brought me in because
of my former association with you guys,

582
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:32,617
but, small world, though.

583
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:36,621
Your friend, Ms. Michaels?
She's my sister-in-law.

584
00:32:36,787 --> 00:32:37,788
-Andy...
-Point being,

585
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:41,126
her husband is crawling around
these ventilation shafts right now.

586
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,755
If you put a gun on him,
she'll tell you whatever you need to know.

587
00:32:45,921 --> 00:32:46,965
You son of a...

588
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,677
Turning on your own brother,
that's ice cold.

589
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:55,306
Now, you know better than most.
John and I never saw eye to eye.

590
00:32:58,184 --> 00:33:00,645
Gentlemen, check the facility's
ventilation shafts.

591
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:05,150
Overwatch?

592
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:07,152
FELICITY: <i>C-and-C three floors down.
Northeast corner.</i>

593
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:09,070
That'll give us a few minutes.

594
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:13,658
(ALL GRUNTING)

595
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:32,010
(DIGGLE GRUNTING)

596
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:37,057
The other Diggle brother.
Isn't this quaint?

597
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:40,018
I get out of these cuffs and you'll see
how quaint you think I can be.

598
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:42,187
It's a shame you can't be
more like the little Diggle.

599
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:45,440
<i>His pragmatism has proven to be
quite the asset.</i>

600
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:47,192
Now, if your brother's right,

601
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:52,447
you should be able to convince your wife
to give me what I want.

602
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:55,200
Johnnie, if Rubicon ever got out
in the open...

603
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,535
Ms. Michaels, in five seconds,

604
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:00,705
it's your husband's brains
that will be out in the open.

605
00:34:00,871 --> 00:34:05,043
Four, three, two...

606
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:08,588
Do it. Do it, Lyla.

607
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:11,966
It's all right.

608
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:19,224
Excellent.

609
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:23,478
If you've run out of guys to punch,
Spartan needs an assist.

610
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:25,438
<i>Two assists, actually.</i>

611
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:26,689
Tell us what to do.

612
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:29,900
Shadowspire's getting the access codes
for a secure vault in the sub-level.

613
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,486
I'm trying to stop the codes from working,

614
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:34,780
but I'm going to need Canary and Speedy
as my insurance policies.

615
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:38,576
Where do you want me?

616
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:46,584
This is taking too long.

617
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:50,296
Something's wrong.
Someone's locking me out of the system.

618
00:34:55,551 --> 00:35:00,973
Go away. I'm not you anymore.
I haven't been for a long time.

619
00:35:04,935 --> 00:35:06,020
(SIGHS)

620
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:08,231
I can't get in. I have all the right codes

621
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:11,401
but someone on the outside is preventing
me from entering the sub-level vault.

622
00:35:12,067 --> 00:35:13,861
That's extremely unfortunate.

623
00:36:11,001 --> 00:36:12,753
-You okay?
-Yeah.

624
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:15,798
-You okay?
-Yeah, we're fine.

625
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,470
Good job.

626
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,012
Yeah, it was like you said,

627
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,306
it was the only way
to get us both in here.

628
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:25,766
Just remember whose idea this was.

629
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:27,810
What were you expecting,
a kiss from the President?

630
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:36,026
To Amanda Waller.

631
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:38,738
To Amanda Waller.

632
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:43,951
You remember that time that she tried
to take down the city with a drone strike?

633
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:47,830
Good times.

634
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:49,707
Hey, thanks for the assist tonight.

635
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,917
I was just glad to be useful.

636
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:54,128
Good job jury-rigging
the security system, though.

637
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:56,130
Just trying to make you proud, Felicity.

638
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:57,423
You did.

639
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,468
What are you gonna do about Andy?

640
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:03,178
Still haven't made a decision on that.

641
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:06,098
You mean even though
he just saved your life?

642
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:09,184
Yeah, well, you guys had a whole lot
to do with that.

643
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:11,271
But, you're right,
this is the first time in eight years

644
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:12,980
I've seen shades of my old brother.

645
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,033
You wanted to see me, sir?

646
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:32,333
I already got my cut.

647
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,711
Yeah, it's a token of appreciation
from the boss.

648
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:38,213
He traded the opium for something else.

649
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:39,424
Like what?

650
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:41,592
Ask him yourself.

651
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:44,887
Thank you for your assistance, Mr. Diggle.

652
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:47,348
Lieutenant Joyner sings your praises.

653
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,684
Happy to help.
What did you get for the opium?

654
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:53,062
Legend speaks
of a place of immeasurable power.

655
00:37:53,228 --> 00:37:55,440
Many have disappeared searching for it.

656
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:59,819
So much so that the locals
simply refer to it by one word.

657
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:01,737
Purgatory.

658
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:08,619
I thought we were totally unpacked.

659
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,289
Just humor me.

660
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:13,333
What am I getting?

661
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:16,502
Uh, yes, that white box. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

662
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:24,302
You ready?

663
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:27,472
-Wow!
-(LAUGHING)

664
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:30,516
When you said that you made
some bad personal style choices,

665
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:31,726
you weren't kidding.

666
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:33,728
This is the old me.

667
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:38,441
A rebellious, brunette hacker who didn't
listen to anyone else's rules but her own.

668
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,192
You're not that person anymore?

669
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:41,652
Nope.

670
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,113
What you did last night was amazing.

671
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,991
I was really badass.

672
00:38:47,157 --> 00:38:48,326
Yeah.

673
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:50,703
Though the old me probably would have
stolen the plans for Rubicon

674
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,747
and released them
as some sort of political statement.

675
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:54,457
The old me
would have snapped Joyner's neck.

676
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:56,000
Yeah.

677
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:57,627
We've both grown.

678
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:00,755
Thank you for always being on my side.

679
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,507
No place I'd rather be.

680
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:08,053
Hand me that garbage can and this lighter.

681
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,934
(CLEARS THROAT)
How much medication are you on?

682
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:15,478
Absolutely none.

683
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:16,812
Okay.

684
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:22,777
I just wanna make sure
that my past stays the past, you know?

685
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:29,283
Goodbye.

686
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,702
-One more thing from me.
-What?

687
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:35,415
The doctor said
your condition is permanent.

688
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:39,919
And I don't think that it's healthy

689
00:39:40,085 --> 00:39:46,050
or productive for either of us
to live in denial.

690
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:54,975
But I have seen people speed
and shrink and fly.

691
00:39:57,437 --> 00:40:00,105
We watched a friend of ours
come back from the dead.

692
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:03,734
That is the world that we live in now.

693
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:09,657
And I will not stop searching it

694
00:40:11,241 --> 00:40:13,578
until we find a way
to make you walk again.

695
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:19,667
Hey.

696
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,420
Are you sure about this? 'Cause I'm not.

697
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:24,254
Better than being in that cage, right?

698
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,591
You might wanna wait outside,
I have it from here.

699
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:32,096
Make yourself comfortable.
Lyla's cooking something.

700
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:33,764
Hey.

701
00:40:34,724 --> 00:40:38,268
If this is about reconnecting
with Carly and Andy as well, I, um...

702
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:42,773
I get it, Andy. Step by step, right?

703
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:46,694
-Andy.
-Hey.

704
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:50,114
I'm making pork roast.
Johnnie said it's your favorite.

705
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,616
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

706
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:54,326
We've got another surprise for you, man.
Just a second.

707
00:40:55,745 --> 00:40:57,455
-Hey, Lyla, I...
-Not a word.

708
00:40:58,498 --> 00:41:01,792
John and I both agreed to this.
She's excited to meet you.

709
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:06,964
This is your niece.

710
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:08,132
Hey.

711
00:41:08,298 --> 00:41:10,425
Sara. And that's your uncle Andy.

712
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:13,095
-(WHIMPERS)
-Yeah.

713
00:41:14,514 --> 00:41:16,140
She's got Mom's eyes.

714
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:18,976
Welcome home, man.
