00:00:00,083 --> 00:00:01,710
[Oliver] <i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

2
00:00:01,793 --> 00:00:03,294
<i>After five years in hell,</i>

3
00:00:03,378 --> 00:00:06,756
<i>I returned home with only one goal,
to save my city.</i>

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,425
<i>But I couldn't honor that commitment</i>

5
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:11,428
<i>and honor the promise I made
to the mother of my son.</i>

6
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:13,596
<i>So I asked the best man I know to help.</i>

7
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,223
<i>His name is John Diggle.</i>

8
00:00:15,306 --> 00:00:18,101
<i>And he is the Green Arrow.</i>

9
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:20,228
[Oliver]<i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

10
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:22,564
Could you tutor me some more
before the test?

11
00:00:22,647 --> 00:00:24,899
-See you soon.
-She's pretty cool.

12
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:29,320
His life will be better
with you in it. Just like mine.

13
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,615
Cayden James is the most skilled
hacker the world has ever known.

14
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,492
Eight months ago
he was scooped up by A.R.G.U.S.,

15
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:36,828
and now he's being held without cause,

16
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:38,371
being tortured, who knows what else.

17
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:40,040
Helix is about to extract Cayden James.

18
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:41,124
-One...
-Two...

19
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:42,208
Three.

20
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:45,086
And Laurel,

21
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:48,047
<i>she wasn't dead when we found her
back on Lian Yu.</i>

22
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:19,704
Buy you a drink?

23
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:22,207
Whiskey. Neat.

24
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:24,876
Are you waiting for someone?

25
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:27,295
Is it too cheesy if I say "you"?

26
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,340
I'll let it slide this time.

27
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:32,425
And what about you?

28
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,929
Let me guess. You're a numbers guy.

29
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:37,222
You sit in front of a computer all day

30
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:39,349
and you came here to blow off some steam.

31
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,017
You've got me pegged.

32
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,437
I think the bartender forgot your order.

33
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,359
I have a better idea.

34
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,362
[both panting]

35
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,200
[both moan]

36
00:01:58,535 --> 00:01:59,744
Uh-oh.

37
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:02,664
Looks like I know
your dirty little secret.

38
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:03,790
Oh, it's...

39
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:05,291
[shushes]

40
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,253
I won't tell if you won't tell.

41
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,255
All right.

42
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:13,842
You know my secret. Now...

43
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,762
Tell me one of yours.

44
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:20,682
Okay.

45
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,519
Only if you promise not to tell anyone.

46
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,272
Cross my heart and hope to die.

47
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:29,065
Mmm...

48
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:43,121
[Felicity] William did an excellent job
picking out your tie.

49
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:46,416
{\an8}Yeah. He was very excited.
He wanted to come to dinner.

50
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,294
{\an8}I told him that Raisa
was his date tonight.

51
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:51,004
{\an8}Oh. Well, she's a lucky woman.

52
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,381
{\an8}Has it, um...

53
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:57,677
{\an8}Has it been three years
since the first time we did this?

54
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:00,722
{\an8}Yeah, let's just hope that
this date goes better than that one.

55
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,098
{\an8}I think it will.

56
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,474
{\an8}[whispers] Don't jinx it.

57
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:06,811
{\an8}Masked gunmen could come through the door,

58
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,605
{\an8}and it would've been better
than our first dinner.

59
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,857
{\an8}Well, only because
we were not being blown up.

60
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:14,527
{\an8}[stammers] You know,
also because I wasn't ready.

61
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:16,446
{\an8}Not the way I am now.

62
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,366
{\an8}Well, now the time is right.

63
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,327
{\an8}-[patron] Mr. Mayor?
-Yes?

64
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,287
{\an8}I'm sorry to interrupt.

65
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:27,040
{\an8}I just wanted to say that I'm voting

66
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:30,460
{\an8}against that awful
anti-vigilante referendum.

67
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:31,878
Oh, that's very nice to hear.

68
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,714
Are you two back together? [gasps]

69
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:37,342
Such a sweet couple.

70
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:41,512
{\an8}-Well, enjoy your dinner.
-Thank you.

71
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:43,181
{\an8}Don't forget to vote, okay?

72
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,434
{\an8}[chuckles softly]

73
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:47,977
{\an8}You paid her to say that?

74
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,438
{\an8}I had absolutely nothing to do with that.

75
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:52,774
{\an8}Hmm.

76
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:55,026
{\an8}Well, I am the mayor's girlfriend now,

77
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:58,821
{\an8}so does that get me a break on my taxes,

78
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,990
{\an8}or maybe a pass on jury duty?

79
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:04,535
{\an8}[stammers] I mean, I was gonna offer
to bring you to a fundraiser.

80
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:06,496
{\an8}Hmm...

81
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,164
{\an8}I cannot tell you what it is

82
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,666
{\an8}if you're gonna keep making that face.

83
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:12,252
No. Sorry. It's just, you know...

84
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:18,549
{\an8}[whispers] With Overwatch and the
start-up with Curtis, and, you know...

85
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:23,346
{\an8}It's our old, but new relationship.

86
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,889
{\an8}Maybe we could

87
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:28,977
{\an8}ease into some of the things.

88
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:31,062
{\an8}Of course, of course.

89
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,523
{\an8}I love rolling to those things solo.

90
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:35,566
{\an8}Yeah, you're lying.

91
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,776
{\an8}I'm kidding.

92
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,113
{\an8}I'm really happy that you're busy,

93
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:43,324
{\an8}and I'm especially excited
for this thing with Curtis,

94
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,326
{\an8}because, truth be told,

95
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,579
{\an8}it is important you have something
in your life that is not just...

96
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:49,831
{\an8}-[cell phone vibrates]
-The team.

97
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:51,207
{\an8}-Yes.
-[cell phone beeps]

98
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,003
{\an8}No, I mean... [whispers] The team.

99
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:57,463
{\an8}This is how it felt to be you, isn't it?

100
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,965
{\an8}Oh, yeah.

101
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,259
{\an8}I'm sorry.

102
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:02,927
{\an8}Go.

103
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:12,186
What's going on?

104
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,773
Body dropped outside of a bar.
Dinah's on the scene with SCPD.

105
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:18,943
[Dinah Drake]<i>The vic was dead on arrival.</i>

106
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:22,405
[indistinct radio chatter]

107
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,324
{\an8}Paramedics are calling it
internal hemorrhaging,

108
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,784
{\an8}but I'd recognize this kill
from a mile away.

109
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,870
Sonic Scream did this.
An inch from his ear.

110
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:30,872
-Ouch.
-Laurel.

111
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:33,374
Witnesses saw the vic leaving
with a woman, a brunette.

112
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,293
Maybe Laurel got a wig?

113
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:36,419
According to witnesses,

114
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,296
they were very handsy with each other
on the way out.

115
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:41,049
What do you guys think?
Black Siren turned Black Widow?

116
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:42,258
[breathes deeply]

117
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,302
You know, 'cause she mates and then kills?

118
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:45,386
[both chuckle]

119
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,096
Dinah, thanks. We'll take it from here.

120
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:51,976
Victim was an accountant
named Jackson Klimavich.

121
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:56,397
No criminal record, boring job,
really boring Upswipz profile.

122
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:59,025
Well, he was married,
so maybe not so boring.

123
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:00,610
Boring and scummy.

124
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,821
Sorry. Had to help Lance finish up
the polling analysis.

125
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:08,076
Star City stands at 70% against
the anti-vigilante legislation.

126
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:12,038
That's 70% for us accounting for
the double negative you just used.

127
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:14,165
Yeah, but after everything
this team has done for the city...

128
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:15,708
You'd think it'd be higher.

129
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,168
What'd I miss?

130
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:19,587
Evil Laurel seduced a guy
and then killed him.

131
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:22,298
-Why?
-That's what we have to figure out.

132
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:24,550
First, we've got to find her.
Laurel's been in the wind too long.

133
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,302
Yeah, we're on it.

134
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:27,720
Speaking of being on it,

135
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,514
did you mail out
our articles of incorporation?

136
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:35,228
For our start-up? The documents
required to, you know, start it up?

137
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:38,106
Oh, my God. They are in
a manila envelope on my countertop,

138
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:39,232
-with every intention of mailing them.
-[sighs]

139
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:41,734
I was just telling Oliver
how I'm being stretched too thin.

140
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,152
Wait a minute. What do you mean by "just"?

141
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,612
We were at dinner when I got your text.

142
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:45,988
Felicity...

143
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,365
No, it's the job. It's okay.

144
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:48,866
No, this is all on me.

145
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,576
I 911'd you over one dead body.

146
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,912
-Can you make it back for dessert?
-Well, no.

147
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:54,330
-We have to find Evil Laurel.
-No, no, no.

148
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:55,665
I will find Evil Laurel.

149
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,625
You go out there and take your
ass back and get your man.

150
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,377
-Are you sure?
-Are you kidding me?

151
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,545
I was your guys' biggest shipper.

152
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,672
I feel like the reconciliation
taking effect is kind of on me.

153
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:05,216
-No. You're amazing.
-I'm "terrific."

154
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:07,343
-Well...
-Is that getting old?

155
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:08,427
-I kinda like it.
-You like?

156
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,388
-Yeah. Anyways...
-Cool. All right. Go, go.

157
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:28,030
Finally. I thought you were gonna
keep me waiting here all night.

158
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:32,034
Patience is how wars are won, Miss Lance.

159
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:34,078
Well, the first battle's already over.

160
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,834
Look, I don't know if this is
your first clandestine meeting,

161
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:42,044
but at this point,
most people would say "thank you."

162
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,172
For the item?

163
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,799
Or for leaving a body
for the police to find?

164
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,801
Better than a witness to question.

165
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:02,315
Any reservations?
Concerns about what comes next?

166
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:03,900
Of course not.

167
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,652
This one shouldn't be a problem.

168
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:08,738
Glad to hear it.

169
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:10,823
Until we meet again.

170
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,499
[door lock beeps]

171
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,042
I'm so sorry that I had to bail on dinner,

172
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:26,506
but I'm home now, if you want to
come by for some dessert.

173
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,384
Yes. [chuckles] Yes, that was
intentionally suggestive.

174
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,262
Okay, well, good. I'll see you soon.

175
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,438
Nice try, but I wasn't born...

176
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,023
Alena?

177
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:45,650
Do you always
announce your attacks like that?

178
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,276
What're you doing in my apartment?

179
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,278
You'd think a computer hacker
would know better

180
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,113
than to install a smart-lock on her door.

181
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,324
I mean, what are you doing here?

182
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,076
I need your help.

183
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:57,578
You-you? Or Helix-you?

184
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:58,663
Does it matter?

185
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:00,206
Let's pretend for a second it does.

186
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,083
[sighs]

187
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:03,960
Who gave you that?

188
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,088
Cayden James.

189
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:10,341
He's working on something terrible,

190
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,135
something that will hurt the entire world.

191
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,597
And I need your help to stop him.

192
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,272
I helped you break Cayden James
out of A.R.G.U.S. custody.

193
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:26,691
I went against my friends.
I went against my team,

194
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:30,444
because you told me
that Cayden James was a good man.

195
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:33,197
No, you did it because Cayden could
help you find Adrian Chase.

196
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:34,282
And he delivered.

197
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,659
So, at what point did he become
a criminal mastermind?

198
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:40,079
I don't know, at some point during
his eight months in A.R.G.U.S. custody.

199
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:43,499
They held him in a glorified
shipping container, Felicity.

200
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,752
Nutrition-withholding,
sensory deprivation.

201
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,629
They broke him.

202
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,548
In that case, he should be
in a funny farm somewhere.

203
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:52,216
He shouldn't be
planning the end of the world.

204
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,511
Actually, how do I know that you
being here isn't part of his plan?

205
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,472
Because I could never go along with
what I suspect he's planning, Felicity.

206
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:01,100
I'm a hacktivist, not a monster.

207
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:05,813
You say he has plans to hurt the world?

208
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:08,774
How?

209
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,568
I don't know exactly what he's planning.

210
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:12,361
But I saw a casualty estimate,

211
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:15,323
and the most conservative estimate
is 4% collateral damage.

212
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:16,991
4% of what?

213
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:19,410
The world population.

214
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,872
That's almost 300 million people.

215
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:25,791
If we try and hack his servers,

216
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,543
we might be able to figure out
what he's planning.

217
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,587
-Okay, where is he now?
-Corto Maltese.

218
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:34,050
But I came here because I didn't know
who else to reach out to.

219
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:40,097
-Will you help me?
-[cell phone vibrating]

220
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,560
We set Cayden James loose, Alena.
Of course I'm helping.

221
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,195
Looks like the same M.O.

222
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:57,114
Did Laurel also make out
with this one first?

223
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:00,743
It's a legitimate investigatory question.

224
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,995
Cause of death is the same.
This was definitely Laurel.

225
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,413
Yeah, victimology was similar, too,

226
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,124
insofar as this woman is
just as boring as the first guy.

227
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,168
College librarian.
May even be more boring.

228
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:10,544
Maybe Laurel's killing for sport.

229
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:11,796
Doesn't sound like her.

230
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,590
Black Siren isn't the Laurel
you remember, remember?

231
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,258
Any word on tracking her down?

232
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:19,345
Nothing usable from the CCTV cams
we found on either crime scene.

233
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,181
-Forensics is a dead end as well.
-And Felicity?

234
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:23,808
I tried texting her,
but she hasn't hit me back.

235
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:25,184
Fine. Let's hit the streets.

236
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:26,977
Someone has to be able
to help us find Laurel.

237
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,397
What about me? Uh...

238
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,108
I want to hit streets, too,
and maybe a couple of bad guys.

239
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,276
Curtis, with Felicity AWOL, we need tech.

240
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,444
Keep working that angle.

241
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,989
[stammers] But I've been
working that angle.

242
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,202
[cell phone vibrating]

243
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:45,913
-Another dead end.
-Did you try spoofing the sub-array?

244
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:47,373
-Yeah.
-What about the...

245
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:49,125
Yeah, but these firewalls are crafty.

246
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,918
I mean,
the protection protocols are just...

247
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,711
-Art.
-I was going to say "impenetrable."

248
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,213
But, yeah, that too.

249
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:56,799
Cayden would be the only one
who can get into Cayden's system.

250
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,885
Oh, my God, you're a genius.

251
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,263
You're a genius.

252
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,723
We need to convince Cayden's system
that we're him.

253
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:07,685
That's like saying,
"All we need is a trillion dollars."

254
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:09,228
No, we have to work off Cayden's system.

255
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:11,730
-I told you. He's in Corto Maltese.
-Yeah, but Helix is right here.

256
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,858
We cleared the place out, Felicity.
It's sanitized.

257
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:15,651
What about the wiring?
The digital infrastructure?

258
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:17,027
That's proprietary.

259
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:19,196
Cayden's own design.
We left that in place.

260
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,115
That'll work. Let's get the gear.

261
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:22,992
Does that include a ghost drive?

262
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,035
Because we're gonna need that
to get into Cayden's system.

263
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,328
I know a guy.

264
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:28,330
Whoa. What's all this?

265
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,000
Um, just some stuff for a start-up that
Curtis and I are trying to start up.

266
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,126
Oh, good for you.

267
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,462
-You guys are funded?
-Well, seed money

268
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,338
from our reputation of being
the geniuses of Palmer Tech.

269
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,549
Though I'd feel more like a genius
if I knew what we were starting up.

270
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:41,260
We're thinking something
in the smart-home area.

271
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,344
You're joking.

272
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:44,472
You left Helix...

273
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,223
I was kicked out of Helix. By you.

274
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:47,391
To make home appliances?

275
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:48,767
I thought you wanted to change the world.

276
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,604
I thought you wanted to change the world,
and look where you ended up.

277
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:53,814
-Sorry, that's... I didn't...
-No.

278
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,150
-We should go.
-We should go.

279
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:59,987
-Okay. We good?
-Mmm-hmm.

280
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:03,616
Oliver.

281
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:06,285
Hey. Hi. What are you doing here?

282
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,037
You invited me.

283
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,080
That's right.

284
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:11,332
What is she doing here?

285
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,667
Hi. [chuckles]

286
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:16,086
I'm just gonna go over there.

287
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,547
Okay, come in.

288
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:22,301
I know how much you love to say,
"I told you so."

289
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:23,469
No, that's you.

290
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:25,095
So consider this an early Christmas gift.

291
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,723
Cayden James is a bad person, and
he's planning on doing a bad thing.

292
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:31,268
Are you sure that you can trust her?

293
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,646
I wouldn't exactly use the word "trust."

294
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:35,773
Then wherever you're going,
I'm going, too.

295
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:37,525
No. This isn't your life anymore. No.

296
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:43,531
At least tell the team what you're doing.

297
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:46,242
I will tell them.
I'll call them on my way.

298
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,619
And then, when I'm done,
we can finish dinner.

299
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:50,246
Starting with dessert. Alena.

300
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:51,622
[Alena] Mmm.

301
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,126
I didn't know you guys were back together.

302
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,461
We sure are.

303
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:58,546
[Alena clears throat]

304
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:13,352
[Laurel] Excuse me.

305
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,563
[exhales]

306
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:20,025
-Here you go.
-Oh. Thanks.

307
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:22,319
I'm such a klutz.

308
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:24,238
Don't worry, me too.

309
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,241
I love your shoes. They're so cute.

310
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:28,701
Custom designed.

311
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,871
Girls can rock limited-edition kicks,
too, right?

312
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,372
Absolutely.

313
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:35,499
I'm Dinah, by the way.

314
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,834
Jenny.

315
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:39,003
It's really nice to meet you.

316
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,425
I don't know why
I didn't think of this sooner.

317
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,343
Laurel's cry resonates
in the terahertz range,

318
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,637
which can be triangulated,
according to geography.

319
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,599
Was I supposed to understand
a single word of that,

320
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:52,975
or were you talking to yourself?

321
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:56,186
Sorry. The short version is

322
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,772
I think I've figured out a way
to find Evil Laurel

323
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:00,149
by tracking her sonic cry.

324
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,817
Meaning if she uses it, we can find her.

325
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,444
Yeah. Only problem being, it means

326
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:05,404
-someone's probably in trouble...
-[computer beeps]

327
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:06,530
Whoa!

328
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,366
{\an8}Talk about timing.

329
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,618
{\an8}So that means she just used it, right?

330
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,328
{\an8}-Mmm-hmm.
-Where?

331
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,789
A parking garage
between Marleau and Hainesly.

332
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,458
-I'll tell John and Rene.
-Mmm-hmm.

333
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:24,131
Nothing on Level C.

334
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:26,133
-[Wild Dog]<i>D is clear.</i>
-[Mr. Terrific]<i>A is empty.</i>

335
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:28,719
<i>Except for a sweet-ass Corvette
someone left overnight.</i>

336
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:30,054
[Black Canary] Guys.

337
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,645
-We're too late.
-[Laurel] Actually, you're right on time.

338
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,438
[sonic scream]

339
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,235
[Laurel] My mistake for dawdling, I guess.

340
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,654
It's just...

341
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:49,239
It's just she was so, so pretty.

342
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:54,870
I really wanted to hold her hand
until the end came.

343
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,789
You are one twisted bitch.

344
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,291
That really hurts my feelings.

345
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:00,918
[grunting]

346
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,003
[sonic scream]

347
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,093
[panting]

348
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:11,845
-She's gone.
-Good work tracking her down.

349
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,973
-Don't give me points for being late.
-Call it in.

350
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,686
-[techno music playing]
-[indistinct chatter]

351
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:37,204
Okay. You couldn't have told me to change?

352
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:38,622
You look great.

353
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:42,126
Are we here for a GMD
or an acid-trip techno freak-show?

354
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:43,502
[Alena] Both, if you want.

355
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,629
Okay, so the dealer's name is Amnesiac.

356
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:48,007
But I have no idea how to find him.

357
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,425
Well...

358
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,261
Whoa! Okay! Rude.

359
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,722
Maybe that door guarded by the three
scary dudes with chains for brains?

360
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:55,806
Eh.

361
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,184
They look friendly.

362
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:01,603
[techno music continues]

363
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:08,819
Hello.

364
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,195
You lost?

365
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,322
No. We're here to see...

366
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:15,701
-Amnesiac.
-Hmm, yup.

367
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,205
Now.

368
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:25,085
-[Felicity] Okay, that time...
-I don't think we should go in here.

369
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:26,253
-Hey!
-Hands off!

370
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:28,130
Hey, easy, chrome dome!

371
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:31,258
[man] Forgive my thuggish compatriots.

372
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:34,553
I pay them to uphold a certain aesthetic.

373
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:38,766
You're Amnesiac?

374
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:42,352
Your shock is exactly what
this establishment aims to cultivate.

375
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:46,774
Now, what brings you here?

376
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,609
We need a ghost mirror drive.

377
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,944
-What for?
-That's our business.

378
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,738
[Amnesiac]
And selling illegal tech is mine.

379
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:56,241
And I only get to stay in business
by avoiding legal entanglements.

380
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:59,119
Everything about you two screams narc.

381
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:00,537
Well...

382
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:01,872
[grunting]

383
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:03,999
[groaning]

384
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,296
[exclaims]

385
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,017
[muffled] Whoa, whoa! No!
Don't shoot! It's me!

386
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:23,435
Oliver?

387
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:26,480
-Are you okay?
-No!

388
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:28,315
What the hell are you doing here?

389
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:30,818
Trying to keep you safe.
I saw the guys take you.

390
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:33,362
Yeah. Those guys were taking me
to this guy,

391
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,405
who's gonna give us what we needed
to stop Cayden James.

392
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,616
But now he won't
because you kicked the crap out of him.

393
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,744
God.

394
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:43,747
You screwed up everything.

395
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,420
He said he thought you were police.

396
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,422
You know, me not wanting your help tonight

397
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,716
doesn't have to do with me
just needing to do this alone.

398
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,385
It has to do with me
wanting to protect you.

399
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,720
I was trying to protect you.

400
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,265
You are under 24/7 surveillance
from the FBI right now.

401
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:03,475
-What if somebody saw you?
-I can handle it.

402
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,394
What I cannot handle
and will not stand for

403
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:08,021
is you going off after a criminal
without backup.

404
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:11,066
I get that.
But I don't need that right now.

405
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:12,943
What I need...

406
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,989
What I need is a ghost mirror drive.

407
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:19,449
And I need to get Alena out of here
before they all come to.

408
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,910
-Felicity...
-We will talk about this later.

409
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:27,166
Another boring person.

410
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,333
Disrespect the dead much?

411
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,877
[sighs] He's right.

412
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,753
No connections, no money to speak of,

413
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,381
no apparent benefit to killing
three different people at random.

414
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:35,883
They weren't random.

415
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,968
Autopsies finally came back
on all three victims.

416
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:39,928
Apart from all three being
thoroughly unremarkable,

417
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,430
they had one other thing in common.

418
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,640
All three had traces of Dimotex 75
on their hands.

419
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,184
Dimotex is an adhesive polymer.

420
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,311
It's used on the streets
to rip off fingerprints.

421
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,062
Laurel was stealing fingerprints.

422
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,941
Why would somebody wanna collect
the fingerprints of three nobodies?

423
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:54,735
And I disrespect the dead?

424
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,155
They're not nobodies.

425
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:00,824
They're invisible.

426
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:02,743
Boring jobs, no connection to community.

427
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:05,162
What makes them remarkable
is just how unremarkable they are.

428
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:06,955
What're you saying, hoss? I mean, boss.

429
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,835
What if these peoples' backgrounds
are just a cover?

430
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:16,506
They're boring by design. To be invisible.

431
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,467
So you're saying they're all
some sort of covert operatives?

432
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,718
They could be anything.

433
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:23,138
But whatever they're dealing with,
it's big enough that they needed a cover.

434
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,306
Be nice to know.

435
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:27,017
That way, we could figure out
who Laurel's going after next.

436
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,268
Anybody got a crystal ball?

437
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,605
I might not be able to figure out
where she's headed,

438
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,441
but I might be able to figure out
where she was.

439
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:36,610
Now, sonic cries leave ripples in the air.

440
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:38,654
I might be able to backtrace
where Laurel's been

441
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,113
and maybe even find out a pattern.

442
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:41,949
Maybe even determine
where she's operating out of.

443
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:44,409
I heard two "mights"
and two "maybes," but I'll take it.

444
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,662
In the meantime,
I'll try to raise Felicity.

445
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,288
If anyone can hack through these covers

446
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,499
to these people's real identities,
it's her.

447
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:57,089
Wow, love what you
haven't done with the place.

448
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:59,007
Cat-5 hookups are there and back there.

449
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,259
-Yeah.
-[cell phone vibrating]

450
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,135
One sec. Hey, John.

451
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:04,096
Hey. Did you decide to take a vacation?

452
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:06,306
Uh, no, sorry.
I just have a situation here.

453
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,933
Yeah, Curtis told me about the start-up.

454
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:10,269
No. This isn't about the company.
This is about Cayden James.

455
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,104
And I don't have time
to talk to you about it right now,

456
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:14,273
but you were right and I was wrong
about breaking him out of A.R.G.U.S.

457
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,108
-Felicity, listen...
-I'm at Helix right now.

458
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:17,567
I'm just gonna clear up
this situation real quick.

459
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,861
I will be back to the bunker
before you know it. I promise.

460
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,947
All right. But get back here soon.
We need you.

461
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,282
I'm on it.

462
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:25,784
Got it!

463
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,078
The "mights" and "maybes" have paid off.

464
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:31,957
Backtracing Laurel's soundwaves

465
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,459
produced a probabilistic curve
of geolocations,

466
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:37,462
which I canvassed
by means of cameras of various sorts.

467
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,548
Curtis, less how, more what.

468
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:43,010
I've found a probable location
for Laurel's base of operation.

469
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:44,928
Tasking a keyhole satellite.

470
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:48,640
When was this?

471
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:50,225
Ten seconds ago.

472
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,353
Anybody know that guy?

473
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:56,273
[typing]

474
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:57,357
How about that one?

475
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,568
-Never seen him before.
-I have.

476
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,486
We should go. Felicity's in trouble.

477
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,365
[Felicity]
A file in here is labeled "Arclight."

478
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:07,743
Must be a code name
for whatever James is planning.

479
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:10,746
Now the question is, what is the plan?

480
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:16,793
[sonic scream]

481
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,591
[Alena] You're supposed
to be in Corto Maltese.

482
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:25,135
-This is Cayden James?
-[man] No, Miss Smoak.

483
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:31,975
I'm Cayden James.

484
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:35,896
Very nice to finally
make your acquaintance.

485
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:40,776
In case you're curious about why I'm here,

486
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,444
it's not nostalgia.

487
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,073
It's you.

488
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:49,785
We never finished our conversation
in Corto Maltese.

489
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:52,245
Which is where you thought I was.

490
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:54,956
Because you've been pinging my cell.

491
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,419
I was hurt. Truly.

492
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:03,215
Not by the betrayal so much as the naiveté

493
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,176
of someone I thought had potential.

494
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:09,387
Sorry, Miss Smoak.

495
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:11,765
I'm afraid you're what's known
as collateral damage.

496
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:14,309
Horrible waste of talent.

497
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,730
Make it as humane as possible.

498
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:24,486
One shot.

499
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:26,238
You won't even know.

500
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:29,324
[Felicity] Get down!

501
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,245
[grunting]

502
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,136
[sonic scream]

503
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:52,764
[grunting]

504
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:57,185
[guns firing]

505
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,606
[sonic scream]

506
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,169
How'd you guys know we needed you?
Not that I'm complaining.

507
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:23,253
Felicity.

508
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:27,007
[Alena coughing weakly]

509
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,633
Alena. Alena!

510
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,093
Call an ambulance.

511
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:31,845
[Felicity] Stay with me.

512
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:33,638
Stay with me. Alena.

513
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:35,891
It's bad. It's really bad.

514
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,060
Alena?

515
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,274
[Dinah Drake] How is she?

516
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:45,775
Stabilized.

517
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:48,737
The next couple of hours
will tell her story.

518
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:51,489
I air-gapped her ICU room
just in case if Cayden tried

519
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:53,825
to kill her by hacking
her hospital equipment. He can't.

520
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:56,745
-Hey. You all right?
-Am I all right?

521
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,414
That I broke a genius madman
out of prison,

522
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:01,833
who's apparently working with
the psychopath version of Laurel?

523
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:04,753
Am I okay that I didn't see
what was right in front of my face

524
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:06,171
and now Alena might die?

525
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:07,505
What the hell do you think?

526
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:10,634
Sorry.

527
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:13,428
-It's not you I'm mad at.
-I know that.

528
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:15,513
But right now we need you.

529
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:16,973
Yeah, I know. Curtis?

530
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:20,977
All set. Did everything
just like you told me.

531
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:24,731
I softened the beach, so now
you can, you know, do your thing.

532
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:26,691
Well, I couldn't do that before
because of Cayden.

533
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,695
All right. I'm in.

534
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:33,323
John was right.

535
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:36,451
They're hiding their identities
because they are really important.

536
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:38,620
John thought they were
some kind of spies or something.

537
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,121
More like "something."

538
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,248
All three are access managers

539
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:43,708
for the IDND, the International
Domain Name Directory.

540
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,669
Let's just pretend for a second

541
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:47,045
only you and Felicity know what that is.

542
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:49,673
The Internet is run on domain names.
You start messing with them

543
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:51,883
and you start collapsing
whole parts of the Internet.

544
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,176
So Laurel was stealing fingerprints.

545
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,594
To gain access, I guess.

546
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,638
Well, why steal
three sets of fingerprints?

547
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:57,722
Wouldn't one do the job?

548
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,099
No, the Internet is divided into sections,

549
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:00,642
so no one person
can take it down all at once.

550
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,686
Each manager controls a section.

551
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:04,688
And all three would be needed
to access the master vault,

552
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:06,648
which oversees all sections.

553
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:08,733
Right, so Cayden James wants to
take down the Internet?

554
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:09,818
Can he actually do that?

555
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:12,654
If you destroy the vault, yes.

556
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:15,282
And then what? I can't send an email?
I mean, so what?

557
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:16,992
The Internet controls everything now.

558
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:19,286
Electricity, water supply,
hospital equipment.

559
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:20,996
Also planes, trains and automobiles.

560
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:24,207
Alena said Cayden's casualty estimate
was 300 million people.

561
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:27,877
-Actually, that sounds low.
-I don't disagree.

562
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:30,755
This is all my fault.

563
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,173
[John] All right,
let's keep our focus here.

564
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:33,800
So James and his people
wanna hit this vault.

565
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:35,010
Do we have a location on it?

566
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:37,387
The location is so classified,

567
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,889
they don't even a word
for how classified it is.

568
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:42,225
Be that as it may, I have a hack running.
That'll give us a location soon.

569
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:45,145
Good. Which means you can get home,
take a shower, clear your head...

570
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:46,271
I'm fine.

571
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:48,315
It's not a request, Felicity.

572
00:26:54,612 --> 00:26:55,989
[knock at door]

573
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,701
[both] Hey.

574
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:02,037
John told me what happened.

575
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:03,538
Hmm.

576
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:06,458
So I'm guessing this little visit is
his idea of therapy.

577
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:10,837
Actually, I'm thinking that
he probably wanted you

578
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:15,300
to speak to one of the world's
leading experts in guilt and regrets.

579
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:17,302
[Felicity] Hmm.

580
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,639
[whispers] What's happening now
is not your fault.

581
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,933
Is that what I sounded like
all these years?

582
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:25,852
You sounded smarter.

583
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:27,896
How'd you do it?

584
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:32,567
How did you balance being the Green Arrow,
the mayor, a boyfriend, a brother?

585
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:33,860
How did...

586
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:37,947
How did you do it all by yourself?

587
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:42,369
[stammers] I didn't do it all by myself.

588
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:44,537
I had you.

589
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,749
Yeah, well, I know you're just
saying that to get boyfriend points,

590
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:49,417
and it's working.

591
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:51,378
I'm being serious, Felicity.

592
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:53,088
Even if we weren't together,

593
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:55,757
you were always there with me.

594
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:59,177
Always there to talk me out of stuff,

595
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:01,054
to help me being the Green Arrow.

596
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:04,641
You were literally in my ear

597
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:06,726
every second that I was in the field.

598
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:09,646
And that's why I followed you
to the club tonight.

599
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:12,524
Because I wanted the chance

600
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:15,568
to be there for you
the way that you've been there for me.

601
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:20,031
So then what would I say to you

602
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,201
in this situation?

603
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:24,786
You would

604
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:28,915
tell me that when I... You...

605
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:31,709
[clears throat] freed Cayden James,

606
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,378
I did it because,

607
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,630
at that moment, at that time,

608
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:37,590
in your heart, you thought it was right.

609
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:39,884
Yeah.

610
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,053
You'd tell me not to live in the past.

611
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:44,514
You'd tell me
to make it right in the present.

612
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,559
You'd tell me to trust myself.

613
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:50,603
[chuckles]

614
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:52,939
Well, I am very smart, apparently.

615
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:54,941
So smart.

616
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:56,484
[cell phone chiming]

617
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:01,156
Sorry.

618
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:04,117
-This is becoming a habit.
-It is.

619
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:07,537
And I am incredibly proud.

620
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,843
[grunting]

621
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:23,762
Please.

622
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,472
[gasping]

623
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:28,725
I have a wife and two little girls.

624
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,518
[shushes]

625
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:31,811
I know.

626
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:33,980
I had a family once.

627
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:35,940
[grunts]

628
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:38,610
I appreciate your zeal, Miss Lance,

629
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:41,446
but we just need people down, not dead.

630
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:43,406
Do I question your methods?

631
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,408
Oh, a little gratitude, please.

632
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:47,911
Were it not for me,

633
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:51,164
you would've either starved
or bled to death on Lian Yu.

634
00:29:57,712 --> 00:30:00,632
The Pre-Socratic philosopher
Thales of Miletus,

635
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:04,052
known as the Father of Science,

636
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:07,347
believed that for any event
there was a natural cause,

637
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,932
even if we couldn't see it.

638
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:13,603
And he thought that
with perfect knowledge,

639
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:16,356
man could control anything.

640
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:23,279
Everything.

641
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:38,545
You're just full of surprises, aren't you?

642
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:41,047
Oh, I'm just beginning.

643
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:51,599
Welcome to the inner sanctum.

644
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,121
He's gone.

645
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:14,747
Biometric hand scanners.

646
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:17,917
So cool. Except for the dead body part.

647
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:20,628
Stay sharp.

648
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:23,548
[Wild Dog] This place is huge.

649
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:26,134
Well, it has to be big to
hold, you know, the whole Internet.

650
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:27,552
This way.

651
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:33,725
-Cayden's overclocking the vault CPU.
-[Green Arrow] English, Felicity.

652
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:35,894
He put a virus in the system that's
gonna make the whole thing explode.

653
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,270
[Wild Dog] That's a bit too much English.

654
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:39,480
How much time do we have
before the vault goes boom?

655
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,190
Six minutes. I think I can stop the virus.

656
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:43,067
[stammers] I just need one minute.

657
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:44,152
There's no way Cayden James and Laurel

658
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:45,653
are gonna let you just stand there
and do that.

659

-Get down!

660
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,159
You weren't wrong.

[typing]

662
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:57,832
Your men have engaged the targets.

663
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,334
Our men, Miss Lance.

664
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:02,045
This partnership is a democracy,
after all.

665
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:04,297
Oh.

666
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:07,300
Miss Smoak just appeared on the server.

667
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:10,178
Clever girl.

668
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:14,432
Her ingenuity never disappoints.

669
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:18,978
I'm coding a little something
to occupy her

670
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:22,231
while I take my leave.

671
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:26,527
Do the same for her friends, would you?

672
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,075
No, no, no, no, no!

673
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:33,534
[Wild Dog] "No" is not what we wanna
hear right now!

674
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,578
Cayden just used the processor's
firewall to block me out.

675
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:36,788
I can't shut down the virus remotely now.

676
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:37,872
I'm gonna have to do it onsite

677
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:38,957
before he turns this whole place
into an ashtray.

678
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,291
Not to mention, you know, the Internet.

679
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:42,669
-Where's the processor?
-Northwest quadrant.

680

[Green Arrow] Fine. We'll cover you.

[Wild Dog] We're outgunned here.

We've got you covered.
Can you handle this?

685
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:05,108
I can handle it. Just keep them
off of me for four minutes.

686
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:06,567
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

[sonic scream]

688
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:18,913
[whimpers] Maybe doing this solo
wasn't such a good idea.

689
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,374
-Good thing you're not alone.
-Oliver?

690
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:23,793
Technically if I'm in this chair
that makes me Overwatch.

691
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:26,087
-You're in the bunker?
-I am. You okay with that?

692
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,338
I'm all right with that.
I'm so all right with that.

693
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:28,464
I'm epically all right with that.

694
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:30,008
Especially if you have eyes
on this complex.

695
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,801
I think I do.

696
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:33,011
You've automated this system to the point

697
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:34,429
that William could basically operate it.

698
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:37,473
Do you see the room
in the far northwest quadrant?

699
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:40,101
I do. But I also see 10 hostiles
between you and it.

700
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:41,853
So let me put on the safest path.

701
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,566
Take the corridor to your left.

702
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:50,194
[whispers] Are you sure about that?

703
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:52,947
Sorry, right. My left. Your right.

704
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,490
Just a little bit
of a learning curve here.

Just wanted to give you a little time.

Yeah, well, I'm gonna need it.

736
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:20,701
I have to break through
the processor's protective firewall

to stop Cayden's virus.

Add the fact that the processor
is exponentially overclocking,

00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:55,106
[sighs]

795
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:57,692
I'm gonna take some time.

796
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:03,114
And gain some much-needed perspective.

797
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:06,617
And then, maybe, if you'll have me,

798
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:09,203
come work for you at your start-up?

799
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,371
Yeah, that'd be great.

800
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,081
-Yeah?
-Yeah, you should.

801
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:13,249
I mean, maybe in a year or two,

802
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:15,376
Curtis and I'll actually have an idea
of what to develop.

803
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:17,586
Oh, actually,
I have a pitch for you on that.

804
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,463
-Yeah?
-Mmm-hmm.

805
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:21,966
Why did you get fired from Palmer Tech?

806
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:24,844
Well, besides me being lousy
at balancing my time

807
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:27,054
and working with the team?

808
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,181
The board actually violently resisted my...

809
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:31,392
Efforts to replicate your spinal implant.

810
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:33,227
Yeah.

811
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:35,730
You've been looking
for something to work on,

812
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:38,399
something that would change the world,

813
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:42,361
and you've literally been sitting
on the right idea this whole time.

814
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:43,446
I couldn't figure out a way

815
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:45,531
to affordably mass-produce
the implant at Palmer Tech...

816
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:48,075
Now you have Curtis
and no board oversight.

817
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:50,536
[chuckles]

818
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:52,705
You know, Curtis and I
have actually had a really hard time

819
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:54,081
coming up with a name for the company,

820
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,375
almost as hard a time
as we have for a concept...

821
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:58,461
So, I was wondering
how you would feel about me

822
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:01,422
appropriating the name Helix?

823
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:05,593
Well, I think you don't generally
need to worry about criminal hackers

824
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:07,511
coming after you
for trademark infringement.

825
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,388
-That's true.
-And I think

826
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:11,307
it would be really nice

827
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,601
to see something good come of the name.

828
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:16,854
-"Helix Dynamics."
-That rolls off the tongue nicely.

829
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,606
Cool logo possibilities,

830
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,149
easily engravable on a Nobel medal...

831
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:22,151
Funny, those are Curtis' criteria, too.

832
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:24,278
-[chuckles]
-I think it's possible.

833
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,702
A reward for a job only half done?

834
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:33,412
A means of preventing them
from tracking you

835
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:34,789
by way of your sonic scream.

836
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:37,166
And the job was done to perfection.

837
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:39,710
I thought the objective
was to take down the Internet.

838
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:43,047
Oh, no, the objective was to take down
the firewall protecting the vault.

839
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:48,219
And Miss Smoak
was most adept in complying.

840
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:51,597
Why couldn't you
find a way to do it yourself?

841
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,934
I've been doing this too long
to leave trails, Miss Lance.

842
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:56,685
Much safer to have Miss Smoak's

843
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:59,397
digital fingerprints
on the processor, not mine.

844
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,524
And once she
helped taking down the firewall,

845
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:03,442
I was able to upload

846
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:07,446
a critical piece of code to Arclight.

847
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:09,448
What happens now?

848
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:11,575
We take the next step.

849
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:24,088
[both panting]

850
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:28,217
Dinner went better than expected.

851
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,886
I can't believe we got through
the whole thing. No interruptions,

852
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:33,347
no armed assassins...

853
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:40,104
And I still have room for dessert.

854
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:41,897
So do I.

855
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:43,065
[Oliver grunting]

856
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:44,567
-Wait.
-That's okay.

857
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:52,241
[cell phone vibrating]

858
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:54,076
[Felicity] Oh, sorry.

859
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,661
-Sorry.
-That's okay.

860
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:56,912
-Sorry.
-Oh!

861
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:58,831
Sorry. Not mine.

862
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:01,792
-Thank you.
-Oh.

863
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:03,794
-One sec.
-Yeah.

864
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:05,671
[continues vibrating]

865
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:08,507
Hello.

866
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,511
Hi.

867
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:16,640
Okay.

868
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:21,145
I'll be there.

869
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:24,315
Mmm-mmm. All right.

870
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,235
That didn't sound like John or the team.

871
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,445
It wasn't.

872
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:31,238
What's going on?

873
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,741
That was Slade Wilson.

874
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:36,994
He needs my help.
