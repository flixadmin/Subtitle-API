6
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,980
All right?

7
00:02:29,979 --> 00:02:32,079
Were not you ever been to the North before?

8
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,708
I had never seen snow.

9
00:02:33,738 --> 00:02:34,838
Nice, right?

10
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,996
I can breathe again.

11
00:02:37,026 --> 00:02:39,211
In the South, the air smells of pig shit.

12
00:02:39,241 --> 00:02:40,680
You've never been to the South.

13
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:43,760
- I was at Winterfell.  - What is the North.

14
00:02:44,308 --> 00:02:47,753
How do you live here?  How can you not freeze you to the bone?

15
00:02:47,783 --> 00:02:50,239
You have to move all the time, that's the secret.

16
00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:52,889
Walking is fine, fighting is better ...

17
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:54,250
fuck it is the maximum.

18
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,276
There are women living within hundreds of miles here.

19
00:02:57,306 --> 00:02:59,756
You have to make do with what you have.

20
00:03:04,654 --> 00:03:06,804
That does not seem very smart.

21
00:03:07,575 --> 00:03:10,296
Davos says he is a strong fighter, he's good.

22
00:03:10,326 --> 00:03:12,642
It is much more important than being smart.

23
00:03:12,672 --> 00:03:16,172
Smart people are not up here in search of the dead.

24
00:03:17,275 --> 00:03:18,302
Then...

25
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:20,832
You've met the Queen of Dragons, eh?

26
00:03:20,926 --> 00:03:21,738
Then?

27
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:24,910
We will fight on our side if I kneel.

28
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,145
You spent too much time with the Free People.

29
00:03:27,175 --> 00:03:29,425
Now you do not like your knees.

30
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:33,769
Mance Rayder was a great man.

31
00:03:34,117 --> 00:03:35,491
A proud man.

32
00:03:35,962 --> 00:03:39,062
The King Beyond the Wall that you never knelt.

33
00:03:40,533 --> 00:03:43,783
How many of these people died for his pride?

34
00:03:56,334 --> 00:03:58,755
Are you still mad at us, kid.

35
00:03:58,785 --> 00:04:01,935
- you have sold to a witch.  - A priestess.

36
00:04:02,635 --> 00:04:05,017
Admittedly the difference is subtle.

37
00:04:05,047 --> 00:04:06,957
We are fighting a massive war.

38
00:04:06,987 --> 00:04:09,891
- The wars cost.  - I wanted to be one of you.

39
00:04:09,921 --> 00:04:12,721
I wanted to join the Brotherhood, but you sold me.

40
00:04:12,751 --> 00:04:14,101
As a slave!

41
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:16,549
You know what I did?

42
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:19,078
I was tied to the bed, he stripped me naked ...

43
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:22,156
- So far it does not seem so terrible.  - he has covered me with leeches.

44
00:04:22,186 --> 00:04:24,777
- She was naked, too?  - you needed your blood.

45
00:04:24,807 --> 00:04:26,413
Yes, please, I know that.

46
00:04:26,443 --> 00:04:29,360
- It could have been worse.  - He wanted to kill me!

47
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:32,020
- they would have killed me if it was not ... - But they did not!

48
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,755
Or wrong?  So what you're bitching?

49
00:04:35,164 --> 00:04:36,564
I'm not griping.

50
00:04:36,594 --> 00:04:39,172
Your lips are moving and you're complaining about something.

51
00:04:39,202 --> 00:04:40,602
That's complaining.

52
00:04:41,727 --> 00:04:45,477
This guy was shot six times and not feel the protest.

53
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:55,519
Good boy.

54
00:05:00,502 --> 00:05:03,433
The first time I went to the north of the Barrier was with your father.

55
00:05:03,463 --> 00:05:04,813
He was a good man.

56
00:05:05,256 --> 00:05:07,156
He deserved a better son.

57
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,009
You were with him when he died?

58
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:12,009
I was a prisoner of the Brutes.

59
00:05:13,209 --> 00:05:14,559
But the retribution.

60
00:05:15,345 --> 00:05:19,414
I want you to know that I executed all the mutineers that I found.

61
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,969
I do not think there was a worse way for him to leave.

62
00:05:21,999 --> 00:05:23,570
The Night's Watch were his life.

63
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,304
He would die to protect every one of those men.

64
00:05:26,334 --> 00:05:27,669
And they slaughtered.

65
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:30,199
I can not stand that he died that way.

66
00:05:30,649 --> 00:05:33,318
My father was the most honorable man I've ever known.

67
00:05:33,348 --> 00:05:35,900
It was good, from all points of view.

68
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:38,069
Yet he died on the scaffold.

69
00:05:39,871 --> 00:05:42,271
Your father wanted to execute me, you know?

70
00:05:43,005 --> 00:05:44,155
I heard it.

71
00:05:44,667 --> 00:05:46,447
It was the side of right.

72
00:05:46,725 --> 00:05:49,051
Not that he would have hated less.

73
00:05:49,081 --> 00:05:50,651
I'm glad you did not take.

74
00:05:50,681 --> 00:05:51,681
Me too.

75
00:06:00,138 --> 00:06:02,337
It was your father gave me this sword.

76
00:06:02,367 --> 00:06:05,039
He turned the knob to bear wolf.

77
00:06:08,808 --> 00:06:10,658
But it's still Long Claw.

78
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:18,190
Look, Commander Mormont

79
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,100
She thought that you would never have returned to the western continent.

80
00:06:22,277 --> 00:06:23,527
But he came back.

81
00:06:24,662 --> 00:06:27,262
And it has been in your family for centuries.

82
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,410
It is not fair that takes me.

83
00:06:33,436 --> 00:06:34,636
He gave it to you.

84
00:06:36,135 --> 00:06:37,635
I'm not his son.

85
00:06:43,133 --> 00:06:45,433
I brought shame to my House.

86
00:06:46,964 --> 00:06:49,164
I broke my father's heart.

87
00:06:51,675 --> 00:06:54,525
I've lost the right to claim this sword.

88
00:06:56,406 --> 00:06:57,406
It's yours.

89
00:06:58,146 --> 00:06:59,896
It may serve you well well.

90
00:07:00,714 --> 00:07:02,514
And your children after you.

91
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:30,009
Our father often looked at us from up here.

92
00:07:30,202 --> 00:07:31,652
He did not talk much.

93
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:36,480
You probably do not remember it, you were in knitting all the time.

94
00:07:37,052 --> 00:07:38,252
I remember.

95
00:07:40,667 --> 00:07:44,417
Once the boys were shooting arrows with Ser Rodrik.

96
00:07:44,623 --> 00:07:46,023
I came here after.

97
00:07:46,838 --> 00:07:48,983
And Bran had left his bow.

98
00:07:49,013 --> 00:07:50,763
There, resting on the ground.

99
00:07:51,503 --> 00:07:54,703
Ser Rodrik would have caught her if I saw her.

100
00:07:56,204 --> 00:07:58,304
There was an arrow in the target.

101
00:07:59,153 --> 00:08:00,658
There was no one around,

102
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:02,188
just like now.

103
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:04,741
No one could stop me.

104
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:07,918
So I began to pull.

105
00:08:08,386 --> 00:08:13,186
And each shot went over there to take back the arrow and came back to throw again.

106
00:08:14,644 --> 00:08:16,144
I was not very good.

107
00:08:18,188 --> 00:08:20,788
Eventually I hit the bull's-eye.

108
00:08:20,953 --> 00:08:24,536
It must have been the twentieth or fiftieth attempt, I do not remember.

109
00:08:24,566 --> 00:08:26,458
But I hit the bull's-eye.

110
00:08:26,488 --> 00:08:28,188
And then I heard clapping.

111
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,284
I looked up ...

112
00:08:31,517 --> 00:08:34,517
and he was standing right there, smiling at me.

113
00:08:37,296 --> 00:08:40,131
I knew I was doing something against the rules.

114
00:08:40,161 --> 00:08:43,911
But he was smiling, so I knew that I was not wrong.

115
00:08:44,236 --> 00:08:46,536
They were the rules to be wrong.

116
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:50,880
I was doing what was in my fate and he knew it.

117
00:08:53,225 --> 00:08:54,475
But he's dead now.

118
00:08:56,095 --> 00:08:57,799
Killed by Lannister.

119
00:08:58,471 --> 00:08:59,821
With your help.

120
00:09:03,449 --> 00:09:04,456
Thing?

121
00:09:13,877 --> 00:09:15,627
It's not your handwriting?

122
00:09:16,339 --> 00:09:19,599
Septa Mordane I was cracking his fingers because you wrote as well.

123
00:09:21,484 --> 00:09:22,484
"Robb,

124
00:09:22,994 --> 00:09:25,350
I write to you with heart full of sadness.

125
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,480
Our good King Robert is dead

126
00:09:27,546 --> 00:09:29,187
from injuries sustained during the boar hunt. "

127
00:09:29,217 --> 00:09:30,658
You do not have to read it, I remember.

128
00:09:30,668 --> 00:09:32,208
"Our father was accused of treason.

129
00:09:32,218 --> 00:09:35,025
He conspired with Robert's brothers against my beloved Joffrey

130
00:09:35,055 --> 00:09:36,956
and he tried to take his throne.

131
00:09:36,986 --> 00:09:40,502
The Lannister treat me very well and I do not miss anything.

132
00:09:40,532 --> 00:09:44,522
Please do: come to King's Landing, swears allegiance to King Joffrey

133
00:09:44,552 --> 00:09:48,453
and stop any conflict between the great houses Lannister and Stark.

134
00:09:48,483 --> 00:09:50,333
Your sister trusted, Sansa. "

135
00:09:51,547 --> 00:09:53,772
- they are forced to write it!  - But really?

136
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:55,602
With a knife to your throat?

137
00:09:56,174 --> 00:09:58,738
They tortured on a tripod until the bones began to break?

138
00:09:58,748 --> 00:10:01,175
You have no idea of ​​the situation, I was a little girl!

139
00:10:01,185 --> 00:10:04,617
I was too!  I would have her killed before betraying my family.

140
00:10:04,627 --> 00:10:07,471
They told me that was the only way to save our father.

141
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:09,731
And it was stupid enough to believe him.

142
00:10:11,564 --> 00:10:12,706
I remember you.

143
00:10:12,716 --> 00:10:16,237
You were on the platform with Joffrey and Cersei, when our father dragged to the gallows.

144
00:10:16,267 --> 00:10:20,067
I remember your beautiful dress and your elegant hairstyle.

145
00:10:21,925 --> 00:10:24,205
- You were there?  - I was there there.

146
00:10:24,235 --> 00:10:27,385
Standing in the crowd, near the statue of Baelor.

147
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:30,708
And what did you do?  She went to her rescue?

148
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,549
Combattesti against the Lannisters, and didst Dad?

149
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:35,004
- I wanted to.  - But you did not.

150
00:10:35,014 --> 00:10:36,081
Just like me.

151
00:10:36,091 --> 00:10:38,616
But he betrayed.  And I do not even betrayed Robb.

152
00:10:38,646 --> 00:10:42,196
I do not betrayed my entire family for my beloved Joffrey!

153
00:10:44,512 --> 00:10:47,379
You should kneel down to thank me.

154
00:10:47,677 --> 00:10:50,827
We're back at Winterfell just because of me.

155
00:10:51,002 --> 00:10:55,049
You have not won back you nor Jon, who lost the Battle of the Basterds.

156
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:58,585
The battle have won the Knights of the Valley, who came up north for me.

157
00:10:58,615 --> 00:11:01,315
While you what you did, you turned to the world?

158
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,765
I was training.

159
00:11:02,775 --> 00:11:03,855
Training?

160
00:11:04,192 --> 00:11:05,886
Well, while you addestravi,

161
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:09,181
I suffered the pains that you can not even imagine.

162
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:12,961
I do not know what you've been through, but I can imagine many things, trust me.

163
00:11:13,387 --> 00:11:16,787
I would never have survived what I went through.

164
00:11:16,871 --> 00:11:18,821
I guess we'll never know.

165
00:11:22,741 --> 00:11:25,141
What will you do with that letter?

166
00:11:25,891 --> 00:11:27,241
I do not know yet.

167
00:11:28,706 --> 00:11:31,292
To whom have you done reading?  Where do you find it?

168
00:11:31,322 --> 00:11:32,622
You're afraid, are you?

169
00:11:33,937 --> 00:11:35,337
What are you afraid of?

170
00:11:35,479 --> 00:11:37,396
You have not committed any crime.

171
00:11:37,426 --> 00:11:38,607
It will not be hanged.

172
00:11:38,617 --> 00:11:41,341
- Arya ... - Topics that the monsters to Jon, you get angry.

173
00:11:41,371 --> 00:11:42,416
No.

174
00:11:42,446 --> 00:11:43,906
Are not you afraid of Jon.

175
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:46,431
You'll understand, you were just a scared little girl.

176
00:11:46,461 --> 00:11:48,646
All alone with the Lannisters evil.

177
00:11:48,676 --> 00:11:52,626
You know what Cersei would be happy to see us fight this way?

178
00:11:52,903 --> 00:11:55,705
That's what I want, that's what he always wanted,

179
00:11:55,735 --> 00:11:59,385
- he wants to divide us.  - Are you afraid that the Lord read the North.

180
00:12:00,236 --> 00:12:04,537
Their opinion of Lady Sansa would worsen if they knew they had to Cersei orders.

181
00:12:04,567 --> 00:12:07,017
What would the little Lyanna Mormont?

182
00:12:07,671 --> 00:12:10,758
It's younger than you, than when you wrote this letter.

183
00:12:10,788 --> 00:12:13,588
You will say to you too: "But I was only a child"?

184
00:12:15,671 --> 00:12:16,921
Are you angry.

185
00:12:17,591 --> 00:12:20,505
Sometimes anger does make people reckless actions.

186
00:12:20,515 --> 00:12:23,515
Sometimes the fear is making reckless actions.

187
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:26,661
I prefer anger.

188
00:12:56,387 --> 00:12:58,365
You are what they call "Mastiff".

189
00:12:58,395 --> 00:12:59,745
Get up from the cock.

190
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,895
They were told that you were mean.

191
00:13:01,925 --> 00:13:03,992
You are well born, or you'll irritate the wildlings?

192
00:13:04,022 --> 00:13:06,822
I do not really give a fuck of Brutes.

193
00:13:06,956 --> 00:13:07,975
I hate Rose.

194
00:13:07,985 --> 00:13:09,685
The Rosci are beautiful.

195
00:13:09,787 --> 00:13:11,487
We kissed by fire.

196
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,193
Just like you.

197
00:13:13,203 --> 00:13:15,503
Not puntarmi with that finger prick.

198
00:13:20,025 --> 00:13:22,625
Inciampasti in the fire when you were little?

199
00:13:22,998 --> 00:13:24,798
Do not tripped, I drove there.

200
00:13:24,808 --> 00:13:26,534
And since then it has become petty.

201
00:13:26,564 --> 00:13:27,964
You rise from the fuck?

202
00:13:28,213 --> 00:13:30,024
I do not think you're really mean.

203
00:13:30,054 --> 00:13:31,654
You look sad.

204
00:13:32,688 --> 00:13:34,690
Do you want to suck the bird, right?

205
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,700
Bird?

206
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:36,737
The cock.

207
00:13:37,821 --> 00:13:39,858
Bird.  I like it.

208
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:42,010
I had no doubt.

209
00:13:42,374 --> 00:13:44,397
No, I like pussy.

210
00:13:44,841 --> 00:13:47,507
My beautiful is waiting for me at Winterfell.

211
00:13:47,537 --> 00:13:49,424
If I could ever go back.

212
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:51,735
Blond hair, blue eyes.

213
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,320
The world's tallest woman.

214
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:55,879
High almost as much as you.

215
00:13:57,705 --> 00:13:59,044
Di Brienne Tarth?

216
00:13:59,074 --> 00:14:02,321
- Do you know her?  - Shit, you're with Brienne of Tarth?

217
00:14:02,494 --> 00:14:04,394
Well, I'm still with her,

218
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:06,380
but I've seen how he looks at me.

219
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:07,760
And how do you look?

220
00:14:07,993 --> 00:14:10,579
He looks at you as if to disembowel you and eat your liver?

221
00:14:10,609 --> 00:14:11,985
Then you know it seriously!

222
00:14:11,995 --> 00:14:13,295
I cross.

223
00:14:13,328 --> 00:14:15,184
I want to have children with her.

224
00:14:15,214 --> 00:14:19,736
Just think, the huge monstrous children who go to conquer the world.

225
00:14:19,766 --> 00:14:22,991
How did a crazy asshole like you to live so long?

226
00:14:23,021 --> 00:14:25,171
I'm good at killing people.

227
00:14:27,602 --> 00:14:29,133
It does not look like much.

228
00:14:29,143 --> 00:14:30,143
A chi?

229
00:14:30,376 --> 00:14:31,376
Your father.

230
00:14:32,686 --> 00:14:34,436
You'll get caught by your mother.

231
00:14:35,084 --> 00:14:36,234
Did you know him?

232
00:14:36,705 --> 00:14:38,355
Of course I know him.

233
00:14:38,437 --> 00:14:39,994
When he was First Knight.

234
00:14:40,024 --> 00:14:42,035
He sent me in search of the Mountain.

235
00:14:42,065 --> 00:14:45,899
Your Brutes have told me that the Red Donna brought you back to life.

236
00:14:45,929 --> 00:14:48,128
Thoros has revived me too.

237
00:14:48,158 --> 00:14:49,158
Six times.

238
00:14:50,505 --> 00:14:52,805
Both serve the same Lord.

239
00:14:52,889 --> 00:14:54,495
I serve only North.

240
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:56,617
The North did not make you resurrect.

241
00:14:56,627 --> 00:14:58,713
The Lord of Light has never spoken to me.

242
00:14:58,743 --> 00:15:01,308
I do not know anything about him and do not know what he wants from me.

243
00:15:01,318 --> 00:15:02,768
He wants to see you alive.

244
00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:04,504
Because?

245
00:15:04,693 --> 00:15:05,769
Non lo so.

246
00:15:07,246 --> 00:15:10,096
Everyone says to me the same thing.  "I do not know".

247
00:15:10,459 --> 00:15:13,659
What sense does it serve a god if no one knows what he wants?

248
00:15:14,391 --> 00:15:16,641
It's something I think about constantly.

249
00:15:17,102 --> 00:15:19,933
I do not think that our purpose is to understand.

250
00:15:19,963 --> 00:15:21,263
Except for one thing.

251
00:15:21,718 --> 00:15:22,918
We are soldiers.

252
00:15:23,438 --> 00:15:26,188
We need to know what we're fighting.

253
00:15:26,386 --> 00:15:31,286
I do not fight so that a man or a woman I know not sit on a throne of swords.

254
00:15:31,776 --> 00:15:33,514
Then what you fight?

255
00:15:34,181 --> 00:15:35,354
For the life.

256
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:38,185
Death is the enemy.

257
00:15:38,801 --> 00:15:40,201
The first enemy ...

258
00:15:40,308 --> 00:15:41,658
and also the last.

259
00:15:43,456 --> 00:15:45,406
But we all die sooner or later.

260
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,861
The enemy will always win.

261
00:15:48,563 --> 00:15:50,594
But we still have to fight it.

262
00:15:50,624 --> 00:15:52,074
That's all I know.

263
00:15:52,703 --> 00:15:55,453
You and I do not find joy in this life.

264
00:15:56,018 --> 00:15:58,193
But we can keep alive other people.

265
00:15:58,223 --> 00:16:01,323
We can defend those who can not defend themselves.

266
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:06,801
We are the shield that will guard the domain of men.

267
00:16:06,831 --> 00:16:09,281
Maybe the only thing to understand is that.

268
00:16:10,398 --> 00:16:12,048
Maybe we just that.

269
00:16:12,469 --> 00:16:13,469
Aye.

270
00:16:15,219 --> 00:16:16,869
Maybe we just that.

271
00:16:25,043 --> 00:16:27,143
In the fire I saw this place.

272
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:30,738
A mountain like the tip of an arrow.

273
00:16:31,932 --> 00:16:32,982
Are you sure?

274
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:37,641
We are approaching.

275
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,329
You know what I like about you?

276
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,231
- I have not the foggiest idea.  - That you're not a hero.

277
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,603
They are heroic enough, from time to time.

278
00:16:56,633 --> 00:16:58,910
I led the charge to the Mud Gate to King's Landing ...

279
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,964
I do not want you to be a hero.

280
00:17:00,994 --> 00:17:03,394
The heroes do stupid things and die.

281
00:17:04,116 --> 00:17:06,566
Drogo, Jorah, Daario, even that ...

282
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:09,208
Jon Snow.

283
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,778
They'll compete to see who is better.

284
00:17:11,808 --> 00:17:14,135
To make the most stupid thing and heroic.

285
00:17:14,364 --> 00:17:16,588
Of course it's interesting, now that you have appointed them ...

286
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:19,406
Drogo, Jorah, Daario, even that ...

287
00:17:20,169 --> 00:17:21,219
Jon Snow...

288
00:17:22,105 --> 00:17:23,832
They fell in love all of you.

289
00:17:23,862 --> 00:17:26,436
- Jon Snow is not in love with me.  - Ah, I'll be wrong.

290
00:17:26,466 --> 00:17:28,850
Certainly looks at him earnestly hopes

291
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,980
to forge a strong and lasting military alliance.

292
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:36,038
It's too low for me.

293
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,820
- That is, I did not mean ... - You're right, it is quite low.

294
00:17:41,302 --> 00:17:42,902
I know you are brave.

295
00:17:43,934 --> 00:17:47,084
I would not choose a coward as my First Knight.

296
00:17:50,451 --> 00:17:51,451
So ...

297
00:17:52,387 --> 00:17:56,887
If everything goes according to plan, I'll finally know your sister.

298
00:17:57,094 --> 00:18:00,899
Although, from what you tell me, I think they will try to kill me rather than talk.

299
00:18:02,285 --> 00:18:06,335
Before you would do unspeakable torture techniques, then kill you.

300
00:18:06,914 --> 00:18:10,386
Nobody trusts my sister less of myself, believe me.

301
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:14,807
But at the time to reach the capital, we'll go with two armies and three dragons!

302
00:18:14,837 --> 00:18:18,276
Should they try to hurt you, King's Landing would be devoured by the flames.

303
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:20,413
And now he'll be setting a trap.

304
00:18:20,443 --> 00:18:21,493
Certainly.

305
00:18:21,671 --> 00:18:23,995
We are wondering what trap have in Serbia for her.

306
00:18:24,025 --> 00:18:25,275
And we have it?

307
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:27,353
A trap?

308
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:32,756
If we are going to create a new, better world ...

309
00:18:32,786 --> 00:18:35,649
I do not think it is appropriate to start with betrayals and massacres.

310
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,908
And what new world did not begin with betrayals and massacres?

311
00:18:39,938 --> 00:18:43,488
Of course, you have to be ruthless if you want to conquer the throne.

312
00:18:43,701 --> 00:18:47,908
You will need to stir up a certain degree of fear, but fear is all that has Cersei.

313
00:18:47,938 --> 00:18:50,588
That's all I had my father, and Joffrey.

314
00:18:50,815 --> 00:18:52,540
Fear undermines the power.

315
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:55,870
Because anyone who is subjected their longs their death.

316
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,666
I think that Aegon Targaryen has thrived there, on fear.

317
00:18:58,696 --> 00:18:59,696
It's true.

318
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,664
But you told me you want to break the wheel.

319
00:19:02,694 --> 00:19:06,189
Aegon has created the wheel.  If you're going to be this kind of queen,

320
00:19:06,219 --> 00:19:08,982
What will make you different from tyrants who preceded you?

321
00:19:09,012 --> 00:19:11,412
Then shall we enter into the lion's den.

322
00:19:12,205 --> 00:19:14,918
My brother promised me that will keep at bay the troops Lannister.

323
00:19:14,948 --> 00:19:18,598
Forgive me, but I do not give any credence to promises of Lannister.

324
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:21,660
- Except yours.  - And I have promised him

325
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:25,912
that I would have dissuaded from engaging in any impulsive action.

326
00:19:25,942 --> 00:19:26,942
Impulsive?

327
00:19:30,574 --> 00:19:32,479
It will be a difficult negotiation.

328
00:19:33,486 --> 00:19:36,436
We parlamenteremo with people who want us dead.

329
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,065
My sister will certainly say something to provoke you.

330
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:40,095
E...?

331
00:19:40,658 --> 00:19:43,504
It is known that easily lose his temper at times.

332
00:19:43,534 --> 00:19:47,534
- That is what great leaders.  - When have I lost my temper?

333
00:19:48,252 --> 00:19:51,166
- When you burned the Tarly, for example?  - It was not an impulsive act.

334
00:19:51,196 --> 00:19:53,046
It was a necessary act.

335
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,025
- Maybe.  - Maybe?

336
00:19:56,491 --> 00:19:59,159
Maybe it was necessary to kill the father, not the son.

337
00:19:59,189 --> 00:20:03,289
Maybe they both need to meditate on their mistakes in a cell.

338
00:20:03,998 --> 00:20:08,129
We could not discuss such possibilities, you have destroyed in one shot.

339
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,113
Sorry, but I think in this case will be on the side of your family!

340
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:13,215
Of course I stand on their side!

341
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:16,799
You have to put yourself on the side of your enemy, if you want to understand their point of view.

342
00:20:16,829 --> 00:20:20,670
And you have to understand their point of view, if you want to predict their actions,

343
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,050
respond effectively and beat them!

344
00:20:23,852 --> 00:20:26,136
What you strongly suggest you do.

345
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:29,466
Because I believe in you and in the world you wish to build.

346
00:20:30,467 --> 00:20:33,520
But the world you intend to build not build it all at once,

347
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:36,250
maybe just not even your whole life.

348
00:20:36,684 --> 00:20:39,526
How are we going to ensure that your vision will survive?

349
00:20:39,556 --> 00:20:44,156
After you've broken the wheel, as we will make sure that no one will rebuild?

350
00:20:44,674 --> 00:20:48,224
Want to know who will sit on the Iron Throne after my death.

351
00:20:50,402 --> 00:20:52,687
You said he could not bear children.

352
00:20:52,717 --> 00:20:55,510
But there are other ways to choose a successor.

353
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,556
The Night's Watch have a method.

354
00:20:57,586 --> 00:20:59,472
The Iron Men, though not without flaws,

355
00:20:59,502 --> 00:21:01,477
- they have another.  - We will discuss my succession after

356
00:21:01,507 --> 00:21:03,892
- my coronation.  - Majesty, I saw hundreds of arrows

357
00:21:03,922 --> 00:21:06,217
be popped out to you during your assault on the Black Water,

358
00:21:06,247 --> 00:21:10,128
and I've seen hundreds mancarti.  But each of these could have hurt you to the heart

359
00:21:10,158 --> 00:21:13,510
- and kill you.  - a long time to imagine dead Steps.

360
00:21:13,977 --> 00:21:16,572
It is one of the topics you have discussed with your brother to King's Landing?

361
00:21:16,602 --> 00:21:18,838
I try to serve you thinking long-term.

362
00:21:18,868 --> 00:21:23,218
Maybe, if I thought the short term, we would not have missed and Dorne Highgarden.

363
00:21:25,841 --> 00:21:27,987
We will discuss my inheritance

364
00:21:28,017 --> 00:21:29,817
after my coronation.

365
00:22:06,819 --> 00:22:07,819
Look!

366
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:17,468
A bear.

367
00:22:18,982 --> 00:22:20,832
A great fuck in the ass.

368
00:22:27,842 --> 00:22:29,542
The bear has blue eyes!

369
00:24:29,804 --> 00:24:32,204
We must bring him Eastwatch.

370
00:24:33,626 --> 00:24:35,026
My flask.

371
00:24:53,163 --> 00:24:54,168
Proceed.

372
00:25:10,405 --> 00:25:11,700
Are you OK?

373
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:14,680
I have just been bitten by a huge dead bear.

374
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:16,150
Aye.

375
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,747
That's right.

376
00:25:19,801 --> 00:25:21,351
Buffa life.

377
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,070
Power.

378
00:25:25,011 --> 00:25:26,011
Issa!

379
00:25:51,774 --> 00:25:53,971
- Where did you get?  - I do not know.

380
00:25:54,835 --> 00:25:56,935
It seems to be full of surprises.

381
00:25:59,462 --> 00:26:00,762
Are you worried.

382
00:26:00,951 --> 00:26:05,551
We ask twenty thousand men to fight with us in the worst winter ever seen.

383
00:26:06,181 --> 00:26:08,881
And the climate will be the least of their problems.

384
00:26:09,021 --> 00:26:11,552
Many of them will be happy to have a reason to return home.

385
00:26:11,582 --> 00:26:14,951
- Put questioned their loyalty.  - Their loyalty is towards Jon.

386
00:26:14,981 --> 00:26:17,250
Jon is not here and I have not heard from him in weeks.

387
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,360
You are the Great Lady Winter.

388
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:22,340
The King has chosen you to rule in his absence.

389
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,096
And you're navigating.

390
00:26:25,551 --> 00:26:26,651
Wisely.

391
00:26:27,231 --> 00:26:28,631
In a manner capable.

392
00:26:28,891 --> 00:26:31,189
They saw it all and respect you.

393
00:26:31,219 --> 00:26:32,695
Some will prefer, too.

394
00:26:32,725 --> 00:26:35,340
Yes, they turned to Jon when we resumed Winterfell,

395
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:38,756
then they elected him their king and now they are ready to turn their backs again.

396
00:26:38,786 --> 00:26:42,829
How much would you trust such men?  They are damned flags.

397
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:45,313
If they found out I wrote that letter ...

398
00:26:45,343 --> 00:26:49,344
A woman who married not one but two enemies of their families.

399
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,642
When he comes back Jon will no longer have an army.

400
00:26:52,672 --> 00:26:54,222
Arya is not like them.

401
00:26:56,796 --> 00:26:58,193
She's your sister.

402
00:26:58,898 --> 00:27:02,322
You will also have discussions, but would never betray his family.

403
00:27:02,352 --> 00:27:05,109
He would if he thought you were going to betray Jon.

404
00:27:05,139 --> 00:27:08,447
- Is that what you think?  - I do not know what he thinks.

405
00:27:08,477 --> 00:27:10,277
I do not know more, now.

406
00:27:12,633 --> 00:27:14,783
Maybe Lady Brienne can help.

407
00:27:17,296 --> 00:27:20,898
He has sworn to protect both daughters of Catelyn Stark.

408
00:27:21,124 --> 00:27:22,175
Is not it?

409
00:27:23,831 --> 00:27:24,831
Yup.

410
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:32,835
And if one of you meant to harm the other,

411
00:27:33,298 --> 00:27:35,543
it would be his duty to intervene?

412
00:27:38,169 --> 00:27:39,176
Yup.

413
00:27:52,146 --> 00:27:54,204
There's one thing I've always wanted to know.

414
00:27:54,234 --> 00:27:55,234
Tell me.

415
00:27:55,447 --> 00:27:59,597
How you were drunk when you came into the breach in the walls of Pyke?

416
00:27:59,794 --> 00:28:03,694
To be honest, I do not remember being passed into the breach.

417
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:07,819
Someone told me about the next morning.

418
00:28:08,414 --> 00:28:11,861
- It looked like a good battle.  - Aye.

419
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:14,940
It was a very good fight.

420
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:18,150
The Iron Men thought I was a god,

421
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:21,040
while troubledst the flaming sword.

422
00:28:21,902 --> 00:28:25,302
I thought you were the bravest man I ever saw.

423
00:28:25,464 --> 00:28:26,964
Only the most drunk.

424
00:29:06,337 --> 00:29:09,889
- Where are the others?  - If we wait too long we will find out.

425
00:29:56,082 --> 00:29:57,182
Attack!

426
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:37,420
Back to Eastwatch.  Send a crow to Daenerys and tell her what happened.

427
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:39,409
- No, I do not leave you.  - You are the fastest.

428
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:40,539
Go, now!

429
00:31:42,057 --> 00:31:44,448
You'll be faster without the hammer, give it to me.

430
00:31:44,478 --> 00:31:45,478
Dammelo!

431
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:55,406
- Let's go.  - Power!

432
00:31:55,681 --> 00:31:56,681
Come on!

433
00:32:03,621 --> 00:32:04,621
Fermi!

434
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,760
Run!

435
00:35:03,842 --> 00:35:05,115
What happened?

436
00:35:05,995 --> 00:35:07,974
- Where are the others?  - Crow ...

437
00:35:08,722 --> 00:35:10,373
We need to send a crow ...

438
00:35:10,383 --> 00:35:12,208
Call the Master, now!

439
00:35:51,861 --> 00:35:53,171
Marriage?

440
00:35:56,598 --> 00:35:57,998
Marriage?

441
00:36:15,321 --> 00:36:18,371
I think it's one of the best ways to die.

442
00:36:30,752 --> 00:36:32,510
Lord of Light,

443
00:36:33,317 --> 00:36:35,058
show us the way ...

444
00:36:35,309 --> 00:36:38,500
Guide us off by darkness and lead your servants towards the Light.

445
00:36:43,832 --> 00:36:46,164
We must burn the corpse.

446
00:36:48,622 --> 00:36:51,043
We will follow all shortly.

447
00:36:51,073 --> 00:36:55,052
Unless the Lord of Light is not kind enough to give us a bit 'of fire.

448
00:37:03,246 --> 00:37:04,956
Lord of Light ...

449
00:37:05,659 --> 00:37:07,725
to break down our darkness.

450
00:37:08,305 --> 00:37:10,849
'Cause the night and' dark and full of terrors.

451
00:37:33,802 --> 00:37:35,774
There congeleremo soon ...

452
00:37:36,762 --> 00:37:38,509
and even water.

453
00:37:42,217 --> 00:37:44,391
When you killed the stranger,

454
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:47,977
almost all the deaths that followed him have fallen.

455
00:37:48,567 --> 00:37:49,805
Because?

456
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:53,160
Perhaps it was he who had transformed them.

457
00:37:53,824 --> 00:37:55,672
We can point to the Others.

458
00:37:56,157 --> 00:37:58,848
- Maybe then we will succeed.  - No ...

459
00:38:00,032 --> 00:38:02,580
We need to bring back that thing.

460
00:38:05,738 --> 00:38:08,286
There is a direct raven Dragonstone.

461
00:38:08,573 --> 00:38:10,995
Daenerys is our only chance.

462
00:38:11,318 --> 00:38:12,318
No.

463
00:38:13,238 --> 00:38:14,538
There's another one.

464
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:18,188
Kill him ...

465
00:38:19,125 --> 00:38:21,117
Li has transformed all of him.

466
00:38:24,965 --> 00:38:26,715
You do not understand...

467
00:38:27,935 --> 00:38:30,734
The Lord brought you back to life, and me too.

468
00:38:31,541 --> 00:38:33,605
No one else, just us two.

469
00:38:34,538 --> 00:38:37,256
Do you think he did it to see us freeze to death?

470
00:38:38,575 --> 00:38:41,679
Careful, Beric, you lost your priest.

471
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:43,814
This is your last life.

472
00:38:43,824 --> 00:38:46,434
It's a long time since the end appearance.

473
00:38:47,026 --> 00:38:49,787
Maybe the Lord brought me here to meet her.

474
00:38:50,004 --> 00:38:52,896
All the Lord that I have ever met are assholes.

475
00:38:53,185 --> 00:38:56,401
I do not see why the Lord of Light should be different.

476
00:39:08,492 --> 00:39:10,143
Mia lady.

477
00:39:19,545 --> 00:39:20,908
Mia lady...

478
00:39:21,626 --> 00:39:25,109
It is an invitation to King's Landing.

479
00:39:31,475 --> 00:39:34,433
- My lady, you are the Lady of Winterfell ... - I am.

480
00:39:34,463 --> 00:39:37,719
And you will represent my interests in this meeting.

481
00:39:38,185 --> 00:39:41,451
They invited you, want you.

482
00:39:42,133 --> 00:39:46,403
I do not set foot in King's Landing with Queen Cersei Lannister.

483
00:39:46,726 --> 00:39:49,920
If you want another prisoner Stark, they can come get me.

484
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:52,566
Until then, I'll stay in my place.

485
00:39:53,176 --> 00:39:55,544
I have work to do here.

486
00:39:57,123 --> 00:39:58,828
It's not safe.

487
00:39:58,838 --> 00:40:02,588
There will Ser Jaime, you said that he treated you well in the past.

488
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:05,036
I'm not worried about me!

489
00:40:05,046 --> 00:40:07,709
There is sure to leave you with Littlefinger.

490
00:40:08,122 --> 00:40:12,787
A lot of guards imprigionerebbero decapiterebbero or without you.

491
00:40:12,797 --> 00:40:14,904
And they trust their loyalty.

492
00:40:15,272 --> 00:40:18,430
Do you think he will not be put to talk behind your back.

493
00:40:18,627 --> 00:40:22,000
At least let me leave Podric to control you.

494
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:25,463
- You become responsible ... - I do not need to be controlled,

495
00:40:25,473 --> 00:40:27,670
or cured, or taking charge.

496
00:40:27,787 --> 00:40:31,636
I'm not a little girl, I am the Lady of Winterfell, and I'm home.

497
00:40:31,646 --> 00:40:34,183
This to me is the safest place.

498
00:40:34,776 --> 00:40:35,826
Mia lady...

499
00:40:36,965 --> 00:40:40,570
I have taken an oath to protect you and your sister, if I ...

500
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:44,967
The journey to King's Landing is long, Lady Brianne, and the roads are icy.

501
00:40:45,451 --> 00:40:48,650
First-party and more opportunity you will have to arrive on time.

502
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:53,256
Yes, my lady.

503
00:41:14,583 --> 00:41:16,072
You can not!

504
00:41:16,997 --> 00:41:21,063
The person most important in the world can not fly to the most dangerous place!

505
00:41:21,093 --> 00:41:23,078
- And who else could?  - Nobody.

506
00:41:23,108 --> 00:41:25,034
They were aware of the risks when they left.

507
00:41:25,064 --> 00:41:27,564
You can not achieve the Throne if you're dead.

508
00:41:27,876 --> 00:41:30,379
You can not break the wheel if you're dead.

509
00:41:30,567 --> 00:41:32,188
Then what would you have me do?

510
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:33,198
Nothing.

511
00:41:33,802 --> 00:41:36,702
Sometimes, nothing is the hardest thing to do.

512
00:41:37,949 --> 00:41:38,999
If you die ...

513
00:41:39,814 --> 00:41:41,364
we will all be lost.

514
00:41:42,804 --> 00:41:44,177
Everything and everyone.

515
00:41:46,262 --> 00:41:49,200
You've already convinced him not to do anything before, and I've listened to you.

516
00:41:49,639 --> 00:41:51,198
I will not do it again.

517
00:42:45,861 --> 00:42:47,311
damn assholes.

518
00:43:09,541 --> 00:43:10,541
Fuck!

519
00:44:13,998 --> 00:44:14,998
Fuck.

520
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:39,331
Retreat!

521
00:45:40,664 --> 00:45:42,123
Retreat!

522
00:45:42,153 --> 00:45:43,153
Courage!

523
00:46:08,538 --> 00:46:09,538
Help!

524
00:49:14,717 --> 00:49:15,717
Jon!

525
00:51:01,824 --> 00:51:02,874
Go away!

526
00:51:03,289 --> 00:51:05,451
Get out, now!  Go away!

527
00:53:55,356 --> 00:53:56,406
Zio Benjen.

528
00:54:00,650 --> 00:54:03,664
- Can you ride up to the passage?  - Come with me.

529
00:54:03,694 --> 00:54:04,896
There's no time.

530
00:54:05,337 --> 00:54:06,337
Are!

531
00:55:18,101 --> 00:55:19,933
We'll meet again, Clegane.

532
00:55:20,743 --> 00:55:22,417
I hope not, fuck.

533
00:55:50,842 --> 00:55:52,541
Time to go, Your Majesty.

534
00:55:54,728 --> 00:55:56,047
Another moment.

535
00:56:29,159 --> 00:56:30,442
Open the gates!

536
00:58:09,283 --> 00:58:11,392
Not quite what you mean, right?

537
00:58:13,159 --> 00:58:16,859
I have hundreds of men here at Winterfell, all loyal to me.

538
00:58:18,007 --> 00:58:19,957
But they are not in this room.

539
00:58:21,867 --> 00:58:23,467
What are these things?

540
00:58:24,093 --> 00:58:25,243
My faces.

541
00:58:28,005 --> 00:58:29,262
Where did you get these?

542
00:58:29,292 --> 00:58:30,295
A Braavos,

543
00:58:30,982 --> 00:58:34,401
during my training at the Faceless Men.

544
00:58:34,431 --> 00:58:35,631
What does it mean?

545
00:58:38,158 --> 00:58:39,258
A Braavos...

546
00:58:40,006 --> 00:58:42,506
before getting my first face ...

547
00:58:42,705 --> 00:58:44,555
I used to play a game ...

548
00:58:44,829 --> 00:58:46,379
the game of the faces.

549
00:58:47,787 --> 00:58:50,637
It's simple: I ask you a question about yourself

550
00:58:51,170 --> 00:58:54,304
and will you invent lies instead of telling the truth.

551
00:58:54,334 --> 00:58:55,728
If you can fool me,

552
00:58:55,758 --> 00:58:56,758
you won.

553
00:58:57,443 --> 00:58:58,639
If you unmasked,

554
00:58:58,981 --> 00:58:59,981
you lost.

555
00:59:00,937 --> 00:59:02,177
Come on, let's play.

556
00:59:03,637 --> 00:59:05,087
I do not want to play.

557
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:08,860
How do you feel about the fact that Jon is the king?

558
00:59:09,829 --> 00:59:12,419
Do you think that maybe you're better suited to rule the North?

559
00:59:12,449 --> 00:59:13,699
Those faces ...

560
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:15,360
what are they?

561
00:59:16,366 --> 00:59:17,913
Is that your question?

562
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:20,160
Are you sure?

563
00:59:20,714 --> 00:59:23,786
The game did not end well for the last person who asked questions.

564
00:59:23,816 --> 00:59:25,316
Tell me what they are.

565
00:59:28,969 --> 00:59:31,919
We dreamed of being different people, from small.

566
00:59:33,122 --> 00:59:35,022
You wanted to be a queen,

567
00:59:35,483 --> 00:59:38,533
and sit on the Iron Throne beside a beautiful king.

568
00:59:39,736 --> 00:59:41,736
I wanted to be a knight,

569
00:59:42,150 --> 00:59:45,900
and a sword, like our father, and go into battle.

570
00:59:47,390 --> 00:59:50,090
No he has become the person you dreamed.

571
00:59:51,101 --> 00:59:54,751
Well, it's true that girls do not decide to become a person.

572
00:59:55,718 --> 00:59:57,268
Now I can do it ...

573
00:59:57,314 --> 00:59:59,764
thanks to those faces, I can choose.

574
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:02,847
Can I become someone else,

575
01:00:03,990 --> 01:00:05,690
speak with his voice,

576
01:00:06,130 --> 01:00:07,780
living in his skin.

577
01:00:10,632 --> 01:00:12,532
I might even be you.

578
01:00:19,887 --> 01:00:21,837
I wonder how it feels ...

579
01:00:22,617 --> 01:00:24,517
to have those beautiful dresses ...

580
01:00:26,375 --> 01:00:28,625
to be the Great Lady Winter.

581
01:00:30,998 --> 01:00:32,748
All you need me ...

582
01:00:35,223 --> 01:00:36,523
your face.

583
01:01:32,683 --> 01:01:33,879
I'm sorry.

584
01:01:36,583 --> 01:01:38,283
I am so sorry.

585
01:01:49,364 --> 01:01:51,364
I wish I could go back.

586
01:01:53,479 --> 01:01:55,629
I would never come here.

587
01:01:58,824 --> 01:01:59,824
Io no.

588
01:02:01,836 --> 01:02:04,436
If we had not come, I would not have seen.

589
01:02:06,009 --> 01:02:07,868
You have to see it to understand.

590
01:02:09,848 --> 01:02:10,948
Now I understand.

591
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:16,110
Dragons are my children,

592
01:02:17,261 --> 01:02:19,261
the only ones I will ever have,

593
01:02:19,697 --> 01:02:20,747
you understand it?

594
01:02:27,188 --> 01:02:30,438
We will destroy the King of the Night and his army ...

595
01:02:31,228 --> 01:02:32,728
and we will do it together.

596
01:02:34,616 --> 01:02:36,016
You have my word.

597
01:02:39,718 --> 01:02:40,868
Thanks, Dany.

598
01:02:42,781 --> 01:02:43,781
Dany?

599
01:02:45,846 --> 01:02:48,046
No one called me that for a long time.

600
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:51,706
Perhaps the last was my brother.

601
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:55,460
And I have good memories of him.

602
01:02:56,504 --> 01:02:57,604
Alright then...

603
01:02:59,352 --> 01:03:00,802
I call you Danny.

604
01:03:04,606 --> 01:03:06,406
How about my queen?

605
01:03:09,809 --> 01:03:11,059
I would be happy...

606
01:03:11,667 --> 01:03:13,367
to kneel down, but ...

607
01:03:13,493 --> 01:03:15,837
And all that you have sworn allegiance?

608
01:03:15,867 --> 01:03:18,087
Will they see you for who you are.

609
01:03:34,406 --> 01:03:35,956
I hope I deserve it.

610
01:03:37,822 --> 01:03:38,972
I'll meriti.

611
01:03:59,323 --> 01:04:00,650
You should rest.

612
01:05:54,288 --> 01:05:59,038
