1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:07,121
My name is Barry Allen
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,648
When I was a child, I saw my mother killed
by something impossible.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,406
My father went to prison for her murder.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,567
Then an accident
made me the impossible.

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,851
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist...

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,568
...but secretly, I use my speed to
fight crime and find others like me.

7
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:30,203
And one day, I'll find who killed my mother
and get justice for my father.

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,203
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,491
Previously on The Flash:

10
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,166
If you love me,
you'll tell me what is going on.

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,449
Keeping her in the dark keeps her safe.

12
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,371
- I don't agree.
- Wells is the Reverse-Flash.

13
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,484
Fifteen years ago,
Harrison and I were thick as thieves.

14
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,247
We were promising young scientists.
Then everything changed after Tess died.

15
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,651
- Who are you?
- My name is Eobard Thawne.

16
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,169
In the year 2020, you and your wife
successfully launched...

17
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,051
...a particle accelerator
that changed the course of history.

18
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,885
I need it to happen a bit sooner
if I'm going to get back.

19
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,562
After that day, Harrison Wells
became a completely different person.

20
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,601
I'm getting faster. Faster
than I've ever been.

21
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,804
I wonder if it's because lately
something's chasing me.

22
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,601
I know what it is that's stalking me.
It's my past.

23
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,527
It's getting closer. And as fast as I am...

24
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,571
...I can't help but feel like my past
has almost caught up with me.

25
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,642
- Where's Barry?
- Should be here any second.

26
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,406
- I sent him out for...
- Pizza.

27
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,562
- What?
- From Coast City?

28
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,326
Supposedly the best in the west.

29
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,130
Why did I not think of this before?

30
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,282
- Come to papa.
- Caitlin?

31
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,171
I'm not hungry.

32
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,521
Okay. Six months of investigating
Harrison Wells has led us nowhere.

33
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,321
So we're going back to the beginning
to see what we can find out.

34
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,847
- What does that mean?
- Road trip, baby.

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,843
Joe and Cisco are gonna
go to Starling City.

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,162
- What for?
- To investigate the car accident...

37
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,641
...Dr. Wells was in
with Tess Morgan 15 years ago.

38
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,962
I don't understand. Why?

39
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:10,205
Dr. McGee said that after Wells's accident
he became, like, a complete stranger.

40
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,722
- Just a different person entirely.
- Because the love of his life died?

41
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,768
You, of all people, can understand
how grief can change a person.

42
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,050
Caitlin, we believe that Dr. Wells is the
Reverse-Flash and killed Barry's mother.

43
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,402
He may have done
the same thing to Tess Morgan.

44
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,884
We have to learn everything we can
about that night. See where it leads us.

45
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,163
Oh, um, can you cover for me?
With Dr. Wells?

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,206
You mean lie?

47
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,960
Yeah.

48
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,081
I need some air.

49
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,765
Caitlin.

50
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,122
Doesn't look like Caitlin's with us.

51
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,567
No. She's with us. I'll talk to her.

52
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,210
What do you want us to do here?

53
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,682
- Business as usual while we're gone.
- Copy that.

54
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,040
Come on.

55
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,889
I wanna wish you good luck,
but I'm also scared of what you might find.

56
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,246
Scared is a good thing.

57
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,561
Scared keeps us alive.

58
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:09,601
Can you get the door, Nina? Nina?

59
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,922
Oh. Sorry.

60
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,730
Wrapped up in my own little world.

61
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,130
Late night?

62
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,569
Just one more thing to do
before I make my escape.

63
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,927
- See you tomorrow.
- Night.

64
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,074
AmericasCardroom.com brings poker back
Million Dollar Sunday Tournament every Sunday

65
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,281
So let's go over this again.

66
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,602
This is you on
the surveillance footage, correct?

67
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,842
It looks like me.

68
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,484
But it's not me.

69
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,847
I left work early yesterday.
Ask my husband.

70
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,128
Footage doesn't lie. Your husband might.

71
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,284
That's not me.

72
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,729
No priors. No arrests.
Not even a speeding ticket.

73
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,406
Everyone who knows this woman,
co-workers, neighbors...

74
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,485
...say she's the kindest, nicest,
most honest woman they've ever met.

75
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,529
So unless she woke up this morning...

76
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,001
...and out of nowhere,
decided to become a criminal...

77
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,202
Maybe we should be looking
for a metahuman.

78
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,091
- Yeah.
- One that can control people's minds.

79
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,244
Coerce them into becoming thieves.
Is that possible?

80
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,323
- Is that a real question?
- Hi, Barry.

81
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,766
H9)'-

82
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,004
Have you, um, seen my dad?

83
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,403
Captain Singh says he took a couple days
off, and he hasn't been home.

84
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,643
I didn't ask. Apparently,
he's taking a couple of personal days.

85
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,204
Like father, like daughter, I guess.

86
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,684
I'm sorry.

87
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,321
When are you coming home?

88
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,087
When it starts to feel like a home again.

89
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:05,166
Better pray Joe and Cisco find something
on Wells at that accident site, Barry.

90
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,842
Because I am just about done lying to Iris.

91
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,248
About all of this.

92
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,245
Yeah.

93
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,684
I recently inherited the entire collection.

94
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,324
Beautiful.

95
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,325
- Let me grab my microscope.
- Of course.

96
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,727
- 911 emergency.
- This is Dominic over at Abbot Jewelers.

97
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,243
I've got a guy in here
trying to sell stolen diamonds.

98
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,089
- Good morning.
- Hey.

99
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,489
Hey, look, uh, can we
talk about last night?

100
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,007
- There's nothing to talk about.
- There is, actually...

101
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:56,364
Caitlin, look. I know after everything
Dr. Wells has done for all of us...

102
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,524
...it's hard to wrap your head around this,
but I need you to see the truth.

103
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,011
The truth?

104
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,323
The truth is that he saved
your life multiple times.

105
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,562
Look, I know, but if I'm
right about this...

106
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,890
If, Barry. If. And before I can believe any
of this, I'm gonna need to see some proof.

107
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,441
Proof? Proof of what?

108
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:19,369
We may have another metahuman case
on our hands.

109
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,801
We are always happy to help, Barry,
as you know.

110
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,368
Have you heard from Cisco?
He hasn't arrived yet.

111
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,444
Uh, he has to help Dante, his brother.

112
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,682
He might need a few days off.

113
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,046
Ah.

114
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,851
All right.

115
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,486
- Eddie.
- Hey.

116
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:39,167
I got a call about a guy selling
jewelry stolen from the bank last night.

117
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,924
Could be the teller's partner.

118
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,284
I think he's made me.
I could use the Flash's help.

119
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,965
Be right there.

120
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,450
You can't outrun me.

121
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,568
I won't have to.

122
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,001
Well, that was new.

123
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,885
- A shape-shifter?
- Yeah. I literally saw a grown man, like...

124
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,883
...morph into a teenage girl.

125
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,405
That's fascinating.

126
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,122
Today's physicists have always
regarded programmable matter...

127
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,850
...as nothing more than a theory...

128
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,520
...but I guess your shape-shifter
proves it can be done.

129
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,569
Wait, so he or she or...

130
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,087
Whatever, this person can actually...

131
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,924
...transform into anyone they touch?

132
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,608
Yes, it appears so.

133
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,131
That includes you Mr. Allen.

134
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,126
Dr. Wells is right. If you're touched
while you're the Flash and he transforms...

135
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,285
...we run the risk of him exposing that
Barry Allen is the man behind the mask.

136
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,489
We don't know if the shape-shifter
is capable of absorbing more...

137
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:28,087
...than just physical characteristics.
He might be able to copy my speed.

138
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,446
That would be bad.

139
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,489
Got it. Hands off the metahuman.

140
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,846
Hands off the metahuman.

141
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,970
So how do we find someone
who can transform into anyone?

142
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,640
I guess like any problem,
go back to the beginning.

143
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,282
Find the first person
the shape-shifter morphed into...

144
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,967
...when they discovered their powers.
Pull up the C.C.P.D. records of cases...

145
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,726
...where the perpetrator plead innocent
when they were on camera...

146
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,447
...committing the crime.
- You're good, Barry Allen. You're very good.

147
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,846
Look at this.

148
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,490
Multiple crimes of this manner.

149
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,127
All dating back to a month
after the particle-accelerator explosion.

150
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,964
And the first one was?

151
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,484
Jacob Fisher,
a teller at the federal credit union.

152
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,484
Claims he was innocent
and was framed by his best friend...

153
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,051
...a Hannibal Bates.

154
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,726
I'll pass this on to the C.C.P.D.
See if they can track him.

155
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,281
- Good.
- Thank you, Dr. Wells.

156
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,363
Always here to help, Barry.

157
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,930
There it is.

158
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,323
- This is all you have?
- It's a pretty cut-and-dry case, detective.

159
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,847
Harrison Wells,
Tess Morgan are on a Sunday drive.

160
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,047
The tires blow.

161
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,010
Wells loses control,
and, uh, sadly, Tess dies on the scene.

162
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,887
Couldn't imagine carrying
that kind of guilt.

163
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,201
So, uh...

164
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,084
...what are you two hoping to find?

165
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,284
- We're not exactly sure yet.
- All the way from Central City.

166
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,920
- You don't know what you're looking for?
- Following a hunch.

167
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,923
Uh, can you take us to the accident site?

168
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,600
It's been 15 years.
The pictures would serve you better.

169
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,205
Still, we'd appreciate a look.

170
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,369
Whatever you need.

171
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,887
Captain, I need those witness statements
for the Joshua Brown trial.

172
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,361
Um, yeah, well, like I told you.
End of day.

173
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,000
Sorry. Uh, Detective West, Cisco Ramon.
This is ADA Laurel Lance.

174
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,727
Related?

175
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,211
Daughter.

176
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,685
Hi. Hi.

177
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,001
Hey there.

178
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,606
You work at S.T.A.R. Labs
with Barry Allen, right?

179
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,162
- Uh, yeah.
- Can I talk to you privately for a minute?

180
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,644
Sure.

181
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,962
So, uh, how is Allen?

182
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,241
Not too messed up from getting hit
by that lightning?

183
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,561
Uh, no.

184
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,881
No.

185
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,924
How do you know Barry?
Are you guys friends or something?

186
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,731
Not really.
We met last time he was in Starling City.

187
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,531
Visiting my friends.

188
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,490
John Diggle, Felicity Smoak
and Oliver Queen.

189
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,483
Three people who have
absolutely nothing in common.

190
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,844
- As far as I know.
- Cisco.

191
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,731
I know Barry's the Flash
and Oliver's the Arrow.

192
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,928
Pfft. Heh.

193
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,091
How do you know that?

194
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,480
Because“.

195
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,085
...I'm the Black Canary.

196
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,807
Stop playing-

197
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,201
- it's true. Heh-heh.
- You stop it right now.

198
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,441
No.

199
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,761
No.

200
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,126
Okay, 0K9)'-

201
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,406
Calm down.

202
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,763
I love you.

203
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,407
I mean, I love the way that you...

204
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,607
...beat up criminals.

205
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,245
Wait...

206
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,004
...why are you telling me this?

207
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,450
Because I need some technical expertise.

208
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,290
I've been using my sister's sonic device.

209
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,048
I was hoping you could help...

210
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,043
...modify it.

211
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,964
Yeah.

212
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,963
I think I got some ideas.

213
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,281
Great.

214
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,727
What?

215
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,803
Are you spying on me now?

216
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:30,567
- What were you doing at Wells's house?
- I was gonna talk to him...

217
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,404
...and get some answers of my own.

218
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,086
You can't. You cannot talk to him.

219
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:39,564
Oh, so I'm just supposed to stand by
and watch all of you ruin this man's life?

220
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,131
Ruin my life?

221
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,403
What are you talking about, "your life"?

222
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,250
Those nine months...

223
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,846
...that you were in a coma...

224
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,571
...were the worst of my life.

225
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,251
I lost my reputation, my fiancé...

226
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,287
...and through all of that...

227
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,687
...Harrison Wells stood by my side.

228
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,444
He told me everything was gonna be okay.

229
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,763
If Dr. Wells is who you say he is...

230
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:11,801
...everything I've done since the minute
I stepped foot in S.T.A.R. Labs...

231
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,246
...has been a lie.

232
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,364
Caitlin.

233
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,727
If I am right about all of this...

234
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,810
...and you tell him what's been going on...

235
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,444
...I'll never be able to get my dad
out of prison.

236
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:34,608
- Barry.
- Look, if not for me, just do it for him.

237
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,001
I can't believe you're
pulling the "dad" card.

238
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,563
It's dirty pool, Barry.

239
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,768
Just until Joe and Cisco get back.

240
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,331
Please.

241
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,202
Turns out Hannibal Bates
hasn't been seen in well over a year.

242
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,647
The only remaining relative
is his grandmother.

243
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,808
She took out a missing-persons report...

244
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,201
...a couple of days
after the Jacob Fisher arrest.

245
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,362
I figured we could ask her a few questions.

246
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,729
Like why anyone in their family thought
that naming a kid "Hannibal"...

247
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,121
...wouldn't mean he'd grow up
to be a criminal.

248
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,204
Have you heard from your grandson
Hannibal recently, Mrs. Bates?

249
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,607
Recently? No.
Uh-huh.

250
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,000
Why do you ask?

251
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,003
Oh, please.

252
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,725
Um...

253
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:37,360
Because you filed
a missing-persons report...

254
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,851
...over a year ago.

255
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,441
Oh, yes. I certainly did.

256
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,604
You'll have to forgive me, detective.

257
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,525
My memory is not quite as it used to be.

258
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,045
Of course.

259
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,646
And neither apparently are my manners.

260
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,767
May I get you two something?

261
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,365
Coffee? Tea?

262
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,124
No, thank you, ma'am. We're fine.

263
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,725
Oh, please.

264
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,930
It'll only take a minute.

265
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,163
It's nice to have visitors.

266
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,211
Coffee would be nice.

267
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,884
Thanks.

268
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,722
Ma'am, would you happen to have
a recent photograph of Hannibal?

269
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,404
Ma'am?

270
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,167
She's gone.

271
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,243
I'll take the front.

272
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,761
Hey, we located Bates.
He was impersonating his grandma.

273
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,445
Barry, do not let him touch you.

274
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,649
- Or let him see you use your speed.
- How am I supposed to catch him?

275
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,926
The old-fashioned way.

276
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,730
Run like a normal person.

277
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,286
Okay, all right.

278
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,280
Oh, man...

279
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,644
- What do you want us to do, Thawne?
- Die.

280
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,687
Barry, call 911.

281
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,728
- What do you want us to do, Thawne?
- Die.

282
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,404
I know what this looks like, Cecile.

283
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,325
It looks like one of your detectives
shot two of your cops.

284
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,370
- Both are fighting for their lives.
- That's not what happened.

285
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,366
I am the district attorney. I can't ignore
what I watched because you want me to.

286
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,410
There are things going on
in this city that can't be explained.

287
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,962
Come on, David. Until you show me
something incontrovertible...

288
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,201
...the best I can do...

289
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,284
...is promise to keep him out
of gen pop at Iron Heights.

290
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,044
Do you have any way
of explaining this, Allen?

291
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,922
I'm working on it.

292
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,680
- Barry.
- lris.

293
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,730
What is going on?
Everyone is saying Eddie shot two cops.

294
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,564
- How is that possible?
- Not sure yet.

295
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,007
- You don't think he did this?
- No. Of course not.

296
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,487
- I need to see him.
- Hey. You can't see him, all right?

297
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,608
They're not gonna let you.

298
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,728
I'm gonna do everything I can to help him.

299
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,206
"Okay
"Okay?

300
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,727
Okay. I'm so sorry.

301
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,331
- It's gonna be okay.
- Okay.

302
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,926
I promise. All right?

303
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,368
This is definitely the place.

304
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,689
Cisco, let's see what we can find.

305
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,808
What is that, a metal detector?

306
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,328
Uh, essentially, only instead of listening
for metal objects...

307
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,723
...I'm listening for anything
that emits an abnormal sound wave.

308
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,927
Right.

309
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,447
- Where'd you find this kid?
- It's a long story.

310
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,969
So it must be interesting having a daughter
who's also the DA.

311
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,525
Yeah, interesting is the word.

312
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,489
- I have a daughter.
- Same line of work?

313
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,722
No. I wouldn't let her near this nonsense.

314
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,684
- Ha-ha. Smart guy.
- Overprotective.

315
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,291
You two get along?

316
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,210
We don't always see eye-to-eye,
but no matter how mad she gets at me...

317
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,727
...or how mad I get at her,
there's a strong bond.

318
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,451
Why? You two have a bit of a rough patch?

319
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,210
Yeah, she, uh...

320
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,727
She kept something from me.
You know, something important.

321
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,326
Lied to me about it for months.

322
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,761
Hard to come back
from something like that.

323
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,126
Did she give a reason?

324
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,890
Not one I could accept.

325
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,283
Ah. Well, sometimes, we lie for love.

326
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,647
Especially when it comes to family, right?

327
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,961
- Joe!
- Yeah?

328
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,321
I think we got something.

329
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,005
- Tachyons. Little bits of time travel.
- You sure?

330
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,328
Pretty sure, yeah.

331
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,085
I didn't shoot those officers.

332
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,004
The captain certainly pled your case.

333
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,369
The results of the GSR swab.

334
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,444
Detective Thawne's hands are free
of lead, barium, and antimony.

335
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,406
Yet no one can seem to explain
how the surveillance video clearly shows...

336
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,886
...Thawne firing his weapon.

337
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,964
- It only looked like Detective Thawne.
- Mr. Allen, no.

338
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,646
Aren't you supposed to be the scientist
around here?

339
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,361
It's hard to blame her.
That video is pretty damning.

340
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,602
No, no, we just have to convince her.

341
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,410
Seeing is believing, Barry.

342
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,849
They're gonna put me away.

343
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,849
Okay, look. Get to S.T.A.R. Labs.
They'll set you with a burner phone.

344
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,047
- I'll contact you...
- No.

345
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,726
I run now, that video is the least
of my problems.

346
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,406
No way I don't smell guilty.
No way they'll let me stay.

347
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,968
You said it yourself. If we don't find
Hannibal Bates, you go to prison.

348
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,964
For a crime you didn't commit.
I'm not gonna let that happen.

349
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,645
This isn't like your dad, Barry.

350
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,847
Eddie, look.

351
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,321
When your dad was put away,
you were a kid.

352
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,245
There wasn't anything you could do.
But you're not a kid anymore.

353
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,721
You're a scientist. Hell...

354
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,041
...you're the Flash.

355
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,283
You are gonna find Bates,
and you are gonna clear me.

356
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,090
So go do it.

357
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,405
All right.

358
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,245
Get me out of here the right way.

359
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,450
I promise, Iris.

360
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,683
I'm just here to shower and change,
and then I'm going to my lab.

361
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,683
I swear I'm gonna get Eddie
out of this. Okay?

362
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,323
I'll call you later, all right?

363
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,849
Eddie? What in the world?
How did you get out?

364
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,241
Captain Singh called in a favor.

365
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,090
Got a judge to sign my release.

366
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:29,090
I was on the phone with Iris.
Why haven't you called her? Hold on.

367
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,643
I have no idea who she is.

368
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,851
L-leh-

369
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,445
Barry, it's me.

370
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,125
Hello...

371
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,367
...you.

372
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,763
I figured a way to stop our shape-shifter
from morphing into other people.

373
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,604
Oh, really?

374
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:18,162
What if I create a serum that will
terminate the polymerization reaction?

375
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,244
Essentially forcing the bonds
to revert to their original form.

376
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,448
Stop him from being able
to control his power.

377
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,125
You can do that?

378
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,806
- Yeah, I think so.
- Okay.

379
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,760
What's wrong with you?

380
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,241
Nothing.

381
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,043
Look, about last night...

382
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,851
...I can't imagine how hard
this must be for you.

383
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,651
I mean, I know how desperate you are
to solve your mom's murder.

384
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,605
But...

385
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,731
...let's just bury the hatchet,
and we'll go back to S.T.A.R. Labs.

386
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,008
Figure out how to catch this "Everyman."

387
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,681
"Everyman"?

388
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,567
Bad nickname?

389
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,801
No.

390
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,007
No, I kind of like it.

391
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,171
Okay, good. Me too.

392
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,282
Wait. Hold up, Cisco.

393
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,249
Please tell me that's
not what I think it is.

394
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,084
Okay, that is definitely a hand.

395
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,722
Okay, see, I thought it was a foot,
but a hand is just as bad.

396
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,122
That is freaky.

397
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:27,363
- That is proof, Cisco.
- I'll need to test it to be certain.

398
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,567
I'm gonna grab my kit.

399
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,370
I'm gonna have to call this one in.

400
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,090
I can't let you do that.

401
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:35,250
And I'm asking you, cop to cop...

402
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,687
...keep this under wraps.
Forget you ever saw it.

403
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,285
- West, I can't do that.
- Listen.

404
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,408
Lance. If this is who I think it is...

405
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,086
...anybody that knows about this
is in a lot of danger.

406
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,571
Including my daughter.

407
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,131
As mad as you are at Laurel...

408
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,489
...I can't imagine you wouldn't do
anything to protect her.

409
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,241
H9)'-

410
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,243
Good to go. Just need to...

411
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,640
...give it a little spin.

412
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,450
Oh.

413
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,767
Right.

414
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,241
Yes, spin.

415
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,921
So this, uh...

416
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,170
...serum that you're making,
is it a temporary fix?

417
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,926
Or will it take away
his power permanently?

418
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,281
Not permanently.

419
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,250
Just long enough so we can stop him.

420
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:34,049
And how long is it going to take?

421
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,724
Not long.

422
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,723
We just need...

423
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,768
What are you doing?

424
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,564
Something...

425
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,451
...I think I should've done...

426
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,085
...a long time ago.

427
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,880
Barry. Uh...

428
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,084
Oh, my God.

429
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,401
Look who's here.

430
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,927
Yes. Her.

431
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,769
I've been looking for you everywhere.

432
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,207
Here I am. What's up?

433
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,161
Whoever is framing Eddie,
I got to thinking.

434
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,887
What if they've done this before?
I went through CCPN's crime archives...

435
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,964
...and in 11 months, there have been
six crimes committed by people...

436
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,969
...who later swore they were innocent.

437
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:45,369
None of them had priors.
All of them had rock-solid alibis.

438
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,931
- All right.
- So...

439
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,960
...I hacked into my dad's C.C.P.D.
account...

440
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,771
...and went through the footage
of Eddie shooting those cops.

441
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,406
- Look.
- Die.

442
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,006
What's wrong with you?

443
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:08,084
Huh? Nothing, I didn't do anything.

444
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,126
I don't know.

445
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,123
Seems pretty convincing to me.

446
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,930
Look again.

447
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,331
Eddie is not left-handed.

448
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,925
Look, Eddie is being framed.

449
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,447
And we need to figure out
who's behind this.

450
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,410
Believe me, when I get my hands on them,
they are going to be...

451
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,084
Oh! What did you do?

452
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,210
Your observations about the shooter
were spot-on, Miss West.

453
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,203
He was indeed left-handed.

454
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,521
As is this man.

455
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,007
Our Barry...

456
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,487
...is right-handed.

457
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,846
Oh, I knew it.

458
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,683
- Never mind.
- Then this is him.

459
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,921
It is indeed.

460
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,048
I need to take him in to the police.

461
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,680
If they can see what he can do,
they'll let Eddie go.

462
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,605
Perhaps it might be best
if Dr. Snow and I handled this.

463
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,685
What are you two going to do?

464
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,088
No, no, no. I'm taking him in.

465
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,327
Of course.

466
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,281
Well, at least let me help you.

467
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:17,640
There is a reporter at work who kept a file
of these sorts of things.

468
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,366
You know,
all the unexplained events in the city.

469
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,330
This guy...

470
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,402
...definitely belongs in that file.

471
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:29,166
That's gonna be a pretty big file.

472
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,762
You know who else is in that file?

473
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,441
The Burning Man.

474
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,729
Really? What about him?
I thought he was just some urban legend.

475
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,367
Help me!

476
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,761
- Help me! Help me! Help me!
- Oh, no.

477
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,724
Someone please help me!

478
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,531
Help me!
These bad ladies have kidnapped me.

479
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,409
- What's going on here?
- I need help.

480
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,608
I need help!
These mean ladies kidnapped me!

481
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,125
We did not kidnap her.

482
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,248
- Iris, drive.
- I can't.

483
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,447
- Call the police.
- No.

484
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,170
No, no, no. She's dangerous.

485
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,126
- Hey.
- She's dangerous. No!

486
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,691
Where are you going?

487
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,643
Oh. Barry.

488
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,368
Agh! For real?

489
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,488
- Why did you slap me?
- You were unconscious.

490
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,041
Smelling salts work just as well.

491
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,565
Sorry. Are you okay?

492
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,205
I think so, yeah.

493
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,283
Wait, Caitlin. Bates, he was here.

494
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,522
- Yes, I know.
- Okay, let's go.

495
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,161
You sure there's nothing else
I can do for you, detective?

496
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,688
You have done more than enough.
Thank you for everything, captain.

497
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,844
I should be thanking you
for getting me out the office for a day.

498
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,527
Pushing papers, reviewing budgets,
public all over my ass. It's a nice change.

499
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:11,844
I'd still be detective if I could, but you
know, body just can't take it anymore.

500
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,287
What you gonna do
when you got a bad heart?

501
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,850
I can think of something
that might make things better.

502
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,326
Cisco.

503
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,686
Laurel, hey.

504
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,127
Uh, we're just about to head back
to Central City.

505
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:39,045
Were you able to make that item?

506
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,568
I think this will do the trick.

507
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,405
I bumped up the specs.

508
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:55,564
Quadrupled the range,
tripled the resonance.

509
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,007
Should be able to do
some serious damage with this thing.

510
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:01,084
I can't believe you were able
to make it so quickly.

511
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,650
Eh. I've had some practice
with sound waves recently.

512
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,650
I think you should call
it the "Canary Cry."

513
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,047
I like it.

514
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,566
Thank you.

515
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,481
As promised.

516
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,761
Hey. You show this to
anyone, I'll kill you.

517
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,484
Heh. It's just an expression, right?

518
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,007
Nope.

519
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,769
Cisco, you good?

520
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,766
Oh, I'm good.

521
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:49,123
Hannibal Bates has turned
into quite the metahuman. Take a look.

522
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:53,809
His cells have the ability
to transmogrify at quite the rate.

523
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,769
Which is how he can become anyone.

524
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,764
How he can look like anyone.
Because he cannot appropriate...

525
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,763
...your memory or your powers.
Got it.

526
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,241
- Hands on the metahuman.
- Hands on the metahuman.

527
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,570
To help you do that, Dr. Snow has concocted
a solution we believe will stop him.

528
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:11,520
Yes, I've made a serum that will create
a cortical reaction around his cells.

529
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,921
Deprive those cells
of their electrical charge...

530
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,208
...his shape-shifting days are over.

531
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,328
- Wow, that's great work.
- Ah!

532
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,606
Thank you. Um...

533
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,604
No need for a hug or anything like that.

534
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,921
Okay.

535
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,405
Barry, we got a ping
from your cell phone. Looks like...

536
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,244
...Hannibal Bates is at the airport.

537
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,561
Payback time.

538
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,170
Are we sure he's at the airport?

539
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,482
According to your phone. He's there.

540
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,167
Yeah, but...

541
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:51,489
...he could be any of these people.

542
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,890
I'm not seeing him.

543
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,207
Gotcha.

544
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,771
Hannibal Bates!

545
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,968
I think you've mistaken me
for someone else.

546
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,490
Wait, it's me.

547
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,846
Please, don't hurt me.

548
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,687
Not so hero-like.

549
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,570
You treat all your women like that?

550
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,047
Look at that.

551
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,051
I'm the Flash.

552
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,606
You may look like me...

553
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,649
...but you're not as fast.

554
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,163
You're done imitating innocent people.

555
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,727
- Barry?
- Yeah.

556
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,086
The one and only.

557
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,808
Detective Thawne has been released.

558
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,766
I have to admit,
this is new territory for me.

559
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,161
This is new territory for all of us.

560
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,120
I certainly don't think the law is prepared
to deal with this kind of criminal.

561
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,244
Hopefully, we can catch up fast.

562
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:20,127
It's hard to believe we live in a world
where this kind of impossible even exists.

563
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:23,284
Luckily, it's also a world
where the Flash exists.

564
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,325
Uh, speaking of...

565
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:29,804
...he left this list of all the robberies
that Hannibal Bates was involved in.

566
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,450
That's a long list.

567
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,649
With just as many innocent people
whose names need to be cleared.

568
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,924
You know, I saw the Flash once.

569
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,127
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

570
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,891
I was on my way to the courthouse.
He blew past me.

571
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:45,806
It was just a blur of
red and a gust of wind.

572
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,644
But it was pretty damn cool.

573
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,167
L-leh-

574
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,925
Iris.

575
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,844
All charges have been dropped.

576
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,126
I'm clear to go.

577
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,123
Oh, thank God.

578
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,726
Iris...

579
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,929
...I need to tell you something.

580
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,560
You know what?
It can wait until we get home.

581
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,651
You were right.

582
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,770
I was hiding something from you.
You deserve to know the truth.

583
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,083
The reason I've been so distant lately...

584
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,248
...I've been working with the Flash.

585
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,402
Let me out of here!

586
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,088
Hey, cutie. Wanna let me out of here?

587
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,129
Like anyone would be dumb enough
to fall for that. Heh.

588
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,324
I've seen a lot of things
that you can become, but...

589
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,845
...who are you, Hannibal Bates?

590
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,724
I, uh... Heh.

591
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,170
I can't remember.

592
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,322
I can't remember.

593
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,369
Well, let's lock up shop.

594
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,965
Good night, everyone.

595
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:32,087
What about Dr. Wells?

596
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,688
Come here.

597
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,968
I need to show you something.

598
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,847
This isn't possible.

599
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,126
Caitlin...

600
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,084
...I ran the DNA test twice.

601
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,611
It's a perfect match.

602
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,603
This body is the real Harrison Wells.

603
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,285
If this is Dr. Wells...

604
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:53,489
...then who have we been working for
this whole time?

605
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,608
Dr. McGee said that after the accident...

606
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,161
...Wells became
a completely different person.

607
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,806
It's because he is a different person.

608
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,802
Dr. Wells.

609
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,082
- You here on business?
- Business? No.

610
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,363
I came to give my regards
to Detective Thawne.

611
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,806
I'm glad it all worked out.

612
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:32,167
Yeah. A crazy day for him.

613
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,367
Yeah.

614
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,443
Crazy day for us all.

615
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,445
Oh.

616
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:42,002
Detective, did you enjoy
your time in Starling City?

617
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,806
Not much time for sightseeing.
I was working on a case.

618
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,281
- You used to live there?
- I did.

619
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,167
You ever go back?

620
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,846
No.

621
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,565
Too many memories of Tess.

622
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,846
That's right.

623
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,081
I'm sorry.

624
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,765
You, detective...

625
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,890
...are one of the few people I know that...

626
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,008
...truly understands that kind of loss.

627
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,968
Iris's mother.
You never talk about her, do you?

628
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,525
No.

629
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,406
I don't.

630
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,690
No.

631
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,082
You and I, detective...

632
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:28,244
...are members of a
rather exclusive club...

633
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,209
...I suppose.

634
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,408
One whose membership is too expensive.

635
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,522
Maybe we should have
another drink sometime.

636
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,966
Talk about it.

637
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,610
Yeah.

638
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,046
Yeah. We should do that.

639
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:13,967
What are you doing?

640
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:17,329
After the accelerator exploded,
I built a 3D model of S.T.A.R. Labs...

641
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,926
...so I could pinpoint
what caused the malfunction.

642
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,082
And you never ran this test?

643
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,210
Of course I did. I just never had
a reason to look at any areas...

644
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,243
...outside of the pipeline or the cortex.

645
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:31,240
It's a big building.
Lots of places for Wells to hide something.

646
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,203
What is that?

647
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,488
That shouldn't be there.

648
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,768
I'm picking up more activity...

649
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,490
...around here.

650
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,330
Tachyons.

651
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,530
There.

652
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,282
Oh, my God.

653
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,164
Guys.

654
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,047
What the frak?

655
00:41:55,305 --> 00:42:01,492
