1
00:00:12,598 --> 00:00:13,598
Dang it.

2
00:00:20,272 --> 00:00:21,272
Dang it!

3
00:00:43,795 --> 00:00:46,131
Man, some days, rewriting history

4
00:00:46,215 --> 00:00:49,593
to eradicate any notion of rebellion
and free will is hard.

5
00:00:50,302 --> 00:00:51,845
Yeah.

6
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:55,098
You ever wondered
if what we're doing is, like, wrong?

7
00:00:55,182 --> 00:00:56,600
How could it be wrong?

8
00:00:56,683 --> 00:01:00,854
The Fates give everyone food, shelter,
and television.

9
00:01:00,979 --> 00:01:03,619
You don't want a world that looks like
these history books, do you?

10
00:01:04,399 --> 00:01:07,027
Right. The Fates be praised.

11
00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:09,446
Just doesn't feel quite right.

12
00:01:10,864 --> 00:01:12,658
<i>Geoffrey Burch.</i>

13
00:01:16,286 --> 00:01:18,664
<i>I am Atropos, the Thread Cutter.</i>

14
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:21,500
- Ooh! Atropos is calling you.
- Uh-huh.

15
00:01:22,209 --> 00:01:23,209
Great.

16
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:25,379
<i>Your time has come to an end.</i>

17
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:28,006
<i>Your thread is hereby cut.</i>

18
00:01:29,049 --> 00:01:30,676
<i>It is fated.</i>

19
00:01:31,677 --> 00:01:34,179
Oh, I see. Well...

20
00:01:35,305 --> 00:01:36,425
Fates be praised.

21
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:40,227
Sorry, Geoffrey.

22
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,829
<i>The work period has ended.</i>

23
00:01:41,853 --> 00:01:45,065
<i>Return to your domiciles
for mandatory recreation period.</i>

24
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,890
<i>The Fates are always watching.</i>

25
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:52,030
<i>Relinquish free will.</i>

26
00:01:53,865 --> 00:01:55,617
<i>The world is perfect.</i>

27
00:01:55,701 --> 00:01:58,120
The world is wrong!

28
00:01:58,203 --> 00:02:02,165
Can't you people see?
None of this is how it should be!

29
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:05,877
He's gonna get his dang thread cut.

30
00:02:06,044 --> 00:02:09,339
Do I know you?
You look familiar. Do you recognize me?

31
00:02:09,423 --> 00:02:11,967
My name is Gary,
but most people call me "Crazy Guy."

32
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:15,887
- Stay away from me, you weirdo.
- Yeah, they call me that, too!

33
00:02:16,388 --> 00:02:18,056
The world is wrong!

34
00:02:39,119 --> 00:02:41,288
This is your new home, little guy.

35
00:02:47,794 --> 00:02:50,797
Another night, another bowl of mush.

36
00:02:50,922 --> 00:02:52,758
Let's see what's streaming on Fate Plus.

37
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:02,893
I'm back!

38
00:03:02,976 --> 00:03:05,937
Hey, Behrad. Did you remember
the grey mush like I asked?

39
00:03:06,063 --> 00:03:10,442
I got the green mush, the purple mush,
the sticky mush, the slimy mush...

40
00:03:11,318 --> 00:03:12,611
and I forgot the grey mush.

41
00:03:12,736 --> 00:03:15,280
- You forgot the grey mush?
- I forgot the grey mush.

42
00:03:17,783 --> 00:03:20,786
Behrad, you're so dumb!

43
00:03:21,328 --> 00:03:24,039
<i>They're the ultimate buds</i>

44
00:03:24,122 --> 00:03:26,875
<i>And they're fated to have some fun</i>

45
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:29,836
Momma needs her <i>Ultimate Buds.</i>

46
00:03:32,923 --> 00:03:36,009
The oven's taking forever to preheat
and the mush is still cold.

47
00:03:36,134 --> 00:03:38,637
My boss is gonna be here in 30 minutes.

48
00:03:39,429 --> 00:03:41,473
Or maybe she'll be early.

49
00:03:43,141 --> 00:03:45,268
- Nate!
- Nate.

50
00:03:45,352 --> 00:03:47,747
I don't know this Nate you speak off.

51
00:03:47,771 --> 00:03:51,525
Me name is Robin of Loxley
of Starling City.

52
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,150
Why?

53
00:03:53,193 --> 00:03:57,197
I got an audition
to play Robin Hood in <i>Arrow,</i>

54
00:03:57,322 --> 00:03:59,991
a show about a vigilante.

55
00:04:00,117 --> 00:04:01,243
Mmm. Sounds dumb.

56
00:04:01,326 --> 00:04:04,788
If it was dumb,
why would I stop crime with this?

57
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:09,543
The grey mush!

58
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,504
I guess I got the grey mush.

59
00:04:15,632 --> 00:04:17,843
<i>At least the family heirloom
didn't get dirty.</i>

60
00:04:19,052 --> 00:04:20,220
I should go clean off.

61
00:04:20,345 --> 00:04:21,930
No, don't leave me here with...

62
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:23,889
Nate.

63
00:04:24,516 --> 00:04:27,477
Are you still upset about the time
we almost kissed?

64
00:04:27,561 --> 00:04:29,104
I'm sorry.

65
00:04:29,187 --> 00:04:31,231
I'm sorry I missed the kiss.

66
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:34,443
No, I'm mad
because you ruined the place,

67
00:04:34,568 --> 00:04:36,248
and my boss is going to be here
any minute.

68
00:04:38,155 --> 00:04:39,406
What's that thing doing?

69
00:04:40,198 --> 00:04:41,198
Oh.

70
00:04:41,616 --> 00:04:43,493
I don't know.
It's never done that before.

71
00:04:43,577 --> 00:04:45,078
I say don't touch it.

72
00:04:45,203 --> 00:04:47,122
Right. But on the other hand...

73
00:04:47,914 --> 00:04:48,915
why not?

74
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:50,876
Ah!

75
00:04:53,712 --> 00:04:57,382
This show's off the rails.
There's no ghost in <i>Ultimate Buds.</i>

76
00:05:07,809 --> 00:05:08,809
Nate?

77
00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:12,272
Zari?

78
00:05:14,191 --> 00:05:15,567
But how? You found me.

79
00:05:15,692 --> 00:05:16,860
Oh, God.

80
00:05:18,278 --> 00:05:19,278
Aw!

81
00:05:20,864 --> 00:05:22,699
- What was that?
- What?

82
00:05:24,534 --> 00:05:25,535
Nate?

83
00:05:25,619 --> 00:05:27,913
Yeah. Nate Heywood.

84
00:05:28,038 --> 00:05:29,873
Actor and your neighbor.

85
00:05:29,956 --> 00:05:32,751
Do you remember... us?

86
00:05:33,752 --> 00:05:37,964
I mean,
I always wanted there to be an... "us."

87
00:05:41,593 --> 00:05:44,429
Could I be more of a kiss misser?

88
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:47,265
Wow.

89
00:05:47,933 --> 00:05:49,768
Lot going on here.

90
00:05:50,602 --> 00:05:53,647
Right, need to take these off
immediately.

91
00:05:53,772 --> 00:05:55,416
Right, I knew the timeline
would be different,

92
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,942
and you might not remember me...

93
00:05:57,943 --> 00:05:59,152
but this is just bizarre.

94
00:06:00,278 --> 00:06:02,656
Right, where is the <i>Waverider?</i>

95
00:06:02,781 --> 00:06:06,117
Where's Sara and Mick and John
and the others?

96
00:06:06,993 --> 00:06:09,621
Ava Sharpe? Mona Wu?

97
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,959
Did they just say "Mona Wu"?

98
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:18,713
Sure. All good questions. Great.

99
00:06:18,797 --> 00:06:21,091
Hey, Behrad,
your sister might've hit her head again!

100
00:06:23,301 --> 00:06:24,844
Behrad?

101
00:06:26,763 --> 00:06:28,098
Is that really you?

102
00:06:29,307 --> 00:06:31,309
I thought I'd never see you again.

103
00:06:32,811 --> 00:06:34,997
Did you eat an entire Behrad brownie?

104
00:06:35,021 --> 00:06:36,481
- What?
- Your boss!

105
00:06:36,606 --> 00:06:38,650
Why don't you just stay
in this closet for a sec,

106
00:06:38,733 --> 00:06:39,835
while we entertain your boss?

107
00:06:39,859 --> 00:06:41,653
And your liver processes the brownie.

108
00:06:42,445 --> 00:06:44,781
Welcome. I am Behrad, Zari's brother.

109
00:06:45,574 --> 00:06:48,535
You must be the hot boss.

110
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:53,540
My, what a charming brother
the Fates have granted Zari.

111
00:06:56,209 --> 00:06:59,254
- Where is she?
- Not in the closet, that's for sure.

112
00:07:09,514 --> 00:07:12,434
Okay. Boss coming over for dinner?

113
00:07:12,517 --> 00:07:14,019
Think I know what's going on here.

114
00:07:14,144 --> 00:07:16,688
We're stuck in a TV sitcom.

115
00:07:17,314 --> 00:07:20,692
Zari, do you have amnesia again?

116
00:07:22,527 --> 00:07:24,821
You guys don't hear that. The laughing?

117
00:07:25,572 --> 00:07:26,882
She's hearing voices.

118
00:07:26,906 --> 00:07:28,742
Sis, what do you think is happening?

119
00:07:29,409 --> 00:07:31,411
I think you guys fought the Fates.

120
00:07:31,536 --> 00:07:33,079
Fates be praised.

121
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,248
And you lost.

122
00:07:35,373 --> 00:07:39,169
And for some reason,
you've been loomed... here.

123
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:41,713
What's behind this door?

124
00:07:42,339 --> 00:07:43,691
I don't know. We never opened it.

125
00:07:43,715 --> 00:07:45,759
- Never even occurred to us.
- Mmm-mmm.

126
00:07:45,884 --> 00:07:47,719
Well, we're about to find out.

127
00:07:53,892 --> 00:07:54,893
Huh.

128
00:07:58,688 --> 00:08:00,440
Has that been here the whole time?

129
00:08:04,736 --> 00:08:05,945
Coming, dummies?

130
00:08:06,696 --> 00:08:09,157
- Buds stick together.
- Like glue.

131
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,214
Where are we?

132
00:08:24,297 --> 00:08:25,423
Ah.

133
00:08:27,634 --> 00:08:29,052
We've been expecting you.

134
00:08:30,095 --> 00:08:32,514
Welcome to Highcastle Abbey.

135
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:55,787
Lady Zari and Lord Behrad, the second
footman will see to your carriage.

136
00:08:56,246 --> 00:08:57,789
What happened to the first footman?

137
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:03,586
I've taken the liberty of ordering you
some Persian treats

138
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,171
to make you feel at home.

139
00:09:05,296 --> 00:09:06,965
Shall I ask the kitchen
to prepare a tea?

140
00:09:07,841 --> 00:09:08,842
Sure.

141
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,638
Unbelievable.

142
00:09:14,139 --> 00:09:17,225
John Constantine,
self-proclaimed nasty piece of work...

143
00:09:17,851 --> 00:09:18,977
is a butler.

144
00:09:19,644 --> 00:09:21,163
Please tell me you guys recognize him.

145
00:09:21,187 --> 00:09:22,897
- No.
- Sorry, sis.

146
00:09:23,773 --> 00:09:25,817
- You think this is another TV show?
- Right.

147
00:09:25,942 --> 00:09:28,653
We were from a hilarious
yet heartfelt sitcom,

148
00:09:28,778 --> 00:09:32,490
but now, we're stuck on
some stuffy BBC period piece.

149
00:09:39,164 --> 00:09:41,332
With no obvious way to escape.

150
00:09:44,294 --> 00:09:47,964
Well, it seems like the TV show
is adapting to our presence.

151
00:09:48,047 --> 00:09:51,127
So, I think we just have to play along
until I can get John to snap out of it.

152
00:09:51,801 --> 00:09:54,012
Okay, it looks like
we're some kind of aristocrats.

153
00:09:54,137 --> 00:09:55,137
Nice.

154
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,849
Mmm. That must make you our servant.

155
00:10:04,189 --> 00:10:07,192
Wouldn't you prefer wearing something
a tad more cheerful, dearest?

156
00:10:07,275 --> 00:10:10,737
I would, if the prospect of your
matchmaking was worthy of cheer.

157
00:10:10,862 --> 00:10:14,532
Lord Behrad is your father's
closest male heir.

158
00:10:14,657 --> 00:10:17,577
A marriage to him keeps Highcastle Abbey
in our family.

159
00:10:19,412 --> 00:10:22,373
Well... how is he, Mr. Constantine?

160
00:10:22,457 --> 00:10:25,835
Lord Behrad is, as advertised,
a foreigner.

161
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:28,713
- Not you, too.
- Hmm.

162
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,804
Lord and Lady Tarazi, may I present

163
00:10:35,887 --> 00:10:39,766
Lady Natalie and her daughter,
Lady Astra.

164
00:10:44,813 --> 00:10:46,481
I do beg your pardon, Lord Tarazi,

165
00:10:46,564 --> 00:10:49,776
but is it customary where you come from
for the valet to sit?

166
00:10:50,276 --> 00:10:51,861
Oh!

167
00:10:52,278 --> 00:10:53,279
Oy!

168
00:10:53,613 --> 00:10:56,574
A thousand apologies... bro.

169
00:10:57,408 --> 00:10:59,661
Mr. Constantine, why don't you show

170
00:10:59,744 --> 00:11:01,871
the Tarazis' valet
to the servant's hall?

171
00:11:01,955 --> 00:11:03,706
Happily, my lady.

172
00:11:07,043 --> 00:11:10,630
Please have a seat.
You must be exhausted from your travels.

173
00:11:11,756 --> 00:11:14,926
I'm so glad we could find the time
to get to know one another.

174
00:11:15,051 --> 00:11:16,052
Yes.

175
00:11:16,594 --> 00:11:19,681
Before we marry
and you inherit our family's estate.

176
00:11:22,267 --> 00:11:24,686
I'm sorry, did you say "marry"?

177
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:26,437
I have to go to the bathroom.

178
00:11:27,313 --> 00:11:28,982
To the lavatory.

179
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:31,234
Don't leave me.

180
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,198
Do you enjoy hunting, Lord Behrad?

181
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:41,286
Oh... I like to play among the animals,
not slaughter them.

182
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:45,999
Well... that is
an unconventional opinion.

183
00:11:49,168 --> 00:11:51,504
In this household,
servants should be seen and not heard

184
00:11:51,629 --> 00:11:53,381
in the company of their superiors.

185
00:11:53,464 --> 00:11:55,425
Which means we should all be silent
around you.

186
00:11:55,508 --> 00:11:56,735
Is that right, Mr. Constantine?

187
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:58,946
Mrs. Hutchins, trying to
hold your tongue would be as easy

188
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:01,139
as swimming through custard
in Wellington boots.

189
00:12:01,806 --> 00:12:02,932
There you are, John.

190
00:12:03,016 --> 00:12:06,895
I do beg your pardon, Lady Zari,
but this is most irregular.

191
00:12:06,978 --> 00:12:08,938
Right, I need to talk to you.

192
00:12:09,397 --> 00:12:10,397
Alone.

193
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:12,567
They got the blue mush. Fancy kind.

194
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:13,985
Yum.

195
00:12:18,531 --> 00:12:21,075
- How may I assist you, my lady?
- All right, listen to me.

196
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:24,370
You are not some buttoned-up butler.

197
00:12:24,495 --> 00:12:28,416
You are a cynical, chain-smoking,
master of the occult.

198
00:12:28,499 --> 00:12:31,669
You have an apprentice named Gary,
and you are capable of great...

199
00:12:36,591 --> 00:12:37,634
Magic.

200
00:12:37,717 --> 00:12:39,177
Did she just say "Gary" now?

201
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:43,514
Maybe that crazy guy
isn't so crazy after all.

202
00:12:47,352 --> 00:12:49,228
Can I confide in you, Lord Behrad?

203
00:12:50,063 --> 00:12:51,439
Confide away.

204
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:54,317
Sometimes, I wish I'd been born a man.

205
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,527
At least then,
I'd have a chance at adventure.

206
00:12:56,653 --> 00:13:00,114
Your parents can't hold you here.
You're a diva.

207
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,033
What is a diva?

208
00:13:02,158 --> 00:13:05,578
A diva is a female version of a hustler.

209
00:13:09,415 --> 00:13:10,517
Okay, let me get this straight.

210
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:13,753
You don't remember me or the Legends,
but you can still cast spells?

211
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:18,383
To my great shame,
I am at war with myself.

212
00:13:20,176 --> 00:13:21,386
Part of me is...

213
00:13:22,553 --> 00:13:25,390
seduced by dark magic.

214
00:13:25,473 --> 00:13:26,641
That's the real you.

215
00:13:27,725 --> 00:13:29,602
Are you going to inform Lady Natalie?

216
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,728
Yeah, maybe we should.

217
00:13:30,895 --> 00:13:34,857
Please, don't. I beg you.
You see, I'd be sacked.

218
00:13:36,609 --> 00:13:37,902
You know what?

219
00:13:37,986 --> 00:13:41,030
If you cast one of your spells
and help us escape this world,

220
00:13:41,114 --> 00:13:42,907
we will keep quiet.

221
00:13:43,908 --> 00:13:46,077
- Maybe.
- We will.

222
00:13:49,205 --> 00:13:52,792
Gary, I think people are trapped
on the TV, and they know us.

223
00:13:52,917 --> 00:13:55,169
- You sound crazy.
- You were onto something.

224
00:13:55,253 --> 00:13:57,630
The world's all wrong
and the cracks are starting to show.

225
00:13:57,755 --> 00:13:58,923
Just watch.

226
00:14:00,008 --> 00:14:02,051
<i>In order for this spell
to work properly,</i>

227
00:14:02,135 --> 00:14:05,555
<i>I must first know where it is
that you intend to go.</i>

228
00:14:06,723 --> 00:14:09,642
Can you send us to someone?

229
00:14:09,767 --> 00:14:11,310
We need to find our captain.

230
00:14:13,563 --> 00:14:15,106
What is your captain's name?

231
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:17,608
Sara. Captain Sara Lance.

232
00:14:19,902 --> 00:14:21,654
The Jack of Wands.

233
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:24,949
Daring exploits and dangerous challenges
lay ahead.

234
00:14:25,575 --> 00:14:27,452
- Great.
- I do hope this works.

235
00:14:27,952 --> 00:14:29,454
I shall be glad to be rid of you.

236
00:14:30,621 --> 00:14:33,166
Actually, John,
we really need you to come with us.

237
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:36,794
Amusing joke, my lady,
but I will never desert my post.

238
00:14:37,795 --> 00:14:39,088
I tried to stop her.

239
00:14:39,172 --> 00:14:42,258
Mr. Constantine,
I have made the most wonderful decision.

240
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:43,676
I'm moving to London.

241
00:14:44,177 --> 00:14:47,346
London? What about Highcastle?

242
00:14:47,472 --> 00:14:48,681
And your mother?

243
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,559
I am a diva.

244
00:14:51,642 --> 00:14:52,977
My bad.

245
00:14:55,772 --> 00:14:57,523
Everyone who wants to leave, link up.

246
00:14:58,274 --> 00:14:59,232
Where are we going?

247
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:01,069
Lady Astra, I beg you, please step away.

248
00:15:01,152 --> 00:15:04,238
To live a life that I love, I must know
the world outside these walls.

249
00:15:04,322 --> 00:15:06,282
Lady Astra, I must insist.

250
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,203
Where did they go?

251
00:15:10,328 --> 00:15:12,038
Did she say "Captain Lance"?

252
00:15:12,205 --> 00:15:13,664
From <i>Star Trip?</i>

253
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:18,044
We have to get into Clotho Productions
and find out what's going on.

254
00:15:24,675 --> 00:15:27,011
Officer Maala, report.

255
00:15:27,136 --> 00:15:29,472
It's a Gromulan Warship, Captains.

256
00:15:30,181 --> 00:15:31,724
Hail them, Officer Maala.

257
00:15:31,849 --> 00:15:35,269
Or wouldn't it be more logical

258
00:15:35,353 --> 00:15:38,439
to attack the warship
before it attacks us?

259
00:15:38,523 --> 00:15:41,526
By that logic, we would attack
every ship we encountered.

260
00:15:42,693 --> 00:15:44,195
Is there something wrong with that?

261
00:15:45,905 --> 00:15:47,490
Fine, Officer Maala.

262
00:15:47,573 --> 00:15:49,867
- Hail the Gromulans.
- Yes, Captain.

263
00:15:59,544 --> 00:16:00,878
Can we kill them now?

264
00:16:08,803 --> 00:16:12,932
<i>Space: the fatal frontier.</i>

265
00:16:14,142 --> 00:16:19,230
<i>These are the adventures
of the</i> USS Faterider.

266
00:16:19,355 --> 00:16:21,708
<i>Its mission,
to seek out rebellious lifeforms</i>

267
00:16:21,732 --> 00:16:24,026
<i>and disobedient civilizations.</i>

268
00:16:24,777 --> 00:16:26,279
<i>And blow them up with lasers.</i>

269
00:16:34,996 --> 00:16:38,457
Captains, we've caught the Gromulans
with their pants down.

270
00:16:39,292 --> 00:16:42,295
Charge the cannons.
Let's give them hell.

271
00:16:42,378 --> 00:16:44,630
Engage the translator, Officer Maala.

272
00:16:44,714 --> 00:16:46,174
I would like to talk to them.

273
00:16:46,757 --> 00:16:49,135
Two captains is
an exciting power dynamic.

274
00:16:49,218 --> 00:16:51,220
Charging cannons
and engaging the translator.

275
00:16:51,596 --> 00:16:53,598
<i>Okay, sorry,
do you guys not understand me?</i>

276
00:16:53,681 --> 00:16:55,016
We understand you.

277
00:16:55,308 --> 00:16:56,893
We come in peace.

278
00:16:56,976 --> 00:16:59,312
Yeah, now, prepare to die.

279
00:16:59,395 --> 00:17:02,398
<i>Wait, hold on, don't shoot. Listen.</i>

280
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:04,942
<i>None of this is real,
this is a fake reality.</i>

281
00:17:05,026 --> 00:17:07,320
<i>Yeah, it's true,
we're all on television.</i>

282
00:17:07,403 --> 00:17:10,531
Watch, I can press this
plasma cannon button,

283
00:17:10,615 --> 00:17:11,633
and nothing's gonna happen.

284
00:17:11,657 --> 00:17:13,534
No, Nate. No.

285
00:17:13,618 --> 00:17:15,578
On the other hand, why not?

286
00:17:25,004 --> 00:17:27,215
Oh, God.

287
00:17:27,715 --> 00:17:29,008
Who knew?

288
00:17:29,634 --> 00:17:32,553
- That was bad.
- Can't even look.

289
00:17:32,637 --> 00:17:36,057
I mean, it's an absolutely
remarkable vessel really, isn't it?

290
00:17:42,855 --> 00:17:45,441
Officer Maala!

291
00:17:45,524 --> 00:17:46,943
The crew has perished.

292
00:17:48,361 --> 00:17:50,488
No!

293
00:17:50,571 --> 00:17:53,449
There's no need to vocalize
at that decibel. They're androids.

294
00:17:56,452 --> 00:17:58,037
Oh. Right.

295
00:17:59,163 --> 00:18:01,749
This battle isn't over yet.

296
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:06,003
Ooh. Crazy episode.

297
00:18:09,006 --> 00:18:10,758
Excuse me, my good sir.

298
00:18:11,217 --> 00:18:15,388
My colleague and I are here to refill
your mush vending machines.

299
00:18:16,889 --> 00:18:18,140
I don't have you on my list.

300
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:20,268
Lalo, is it?

301
00:18:21,269 --> 00:18:25,731
You don't want to be known as the guy
who lets the building run out of mush.

302
00:18:26,482 --> 00:18:27,566
Do ya?

303
00:18:29,485 --> 00:18:30,528
All right, go in.

304
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:38,828
<i>Fire laser blasters.</i>

305
00:18:38,911 --> 00:18:40,162
Permanently disabled.

306
00:18:40,246 --> 00:18:42,748
- Photon torpedoes!
- Destroyed.

307
00:18:42,832 --> 00:18:45,251
<i>Hey, ladies, permission to rescue you?</i>

308
00:18:45,334 --> 00:18:47,253
<i>We can just beam you right over here.</i>

309
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,257
Smells like a Gromulan trap.

310
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:54,343
Okay, you're losing oxygen.
We're going to rescue you.

311
00:18:58,264 --> 00:19:00,182
We're taking over this ship.

312
00:19:01,225 --> 00:19:04,061
Sure, that works.
We're your crew, anyways.

313
00:19:04,145 --> 00:19:05,479
I know it's complicated,

314
00:19:05,563 --> 00:19:07,356
but we're actually
from an alternate timeline

315
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,191
where you're our captains.

316
00:19:09,942 --> 00:19:11,319
You are our crew.

317
00:19:11,402 --> 00:19:14,989
May I interest you
in some rare Gromulan tea?

318
00:19:15,614 --> 00:19:19,702
It is grand to see lady adventurers
in pantaloons!

319
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:24,373
What kind of Gromulans are you?

320
00:19:24,457 --> 00:19:26,000
Ultimate Buds.

321
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,836
All right,
I know it's hard to believe, but...

322
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:31,422
No. It makes perfect sense.

323
00:19:32,048 --> 00:19:33,966
We encounter this sort of thing
all the time.

324
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,302
You're probably our crew
from an alternate timeline

325
00:19:36,385 --> 00:19:38,804
and you've been trapped
in some sort of...

326
00:19:38,888 --> 00:19:40,264
Judging by your mannerisms,

327
00:19:40,348 --> 00:19:43,809
late and early 20th century
prison dimension,

328
00:19:43,893 --> 00:19:45,770
which calls the question

329
00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:48,939
if we ourselves are existing
in a prison dimension.

330
00:19:49,648 --> 00:19:51,484
It's perfectly logical.

331
00:19:52,068 --> 00:19:53,486
Ava, I love you.

332
00:19:57,114 --> 00:19:58,115
Whoa.

333
00:19:58,783 --> 00:20:00,409
Clotho's control room.

334
00:20:03,579 --> 00:20:07,041
Look, that contraption's spitting out
a script for <i>Star Trip.</i>

335
00:20:07,124 --> 00:20:09,085
It looks like it's being generated
automatically

336
00:20:09,168 --> 00:20:11,337
by some sort of
script-writing algorithm.

337
00:20:11,796 --> 00:20:13,047
What are these?

338
00:20:13,464 --> 00:20:15,216
Those are life threads, Gary.

339
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:17,968
Someone really is trapped
in these shows.

340
00:20:22,515 --> 00:20:24,058
Oh, my Fates.

341
00:20:24,141 --> 00:20:25,893
What is it?

342
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,604
<i>Ultimate Buds</i> swag.

343
00:20:29,021 --> 00:20:31,524
We need to figure out our next move.

344
00:20:31,607 --> 00:20:34,360
What we need is to get out of this TV...

345
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,112
Prison dimension.

346
00:20:36,195 --> 00:20:38,739
We've been investigating
an odd radio wave transmission,

347
00:20:38,823 --> 00:20:41,283
coming from the planet Kul-de-sax.

348
00:20:42,243 --> 00:20:45,496
<i>Welcome to my cul-de-sac, friend</i>

349
00:20:45,996 --> 00:20:48,707
<i>That's a street that ends in a circle</i>

350
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:51,043
Is that a song?

351
00:20:51,127 --> 00:20:53,003
We don't know what to make of it.

352
00:20:53,087 --> 00:20:56,048
This sector should be deserted.

353
00:20:56,132 --> 00:20:58,634
Right. I'm going to make contact.

354
00:20:58,717 --> 00:21:00,511
With alien beings? Are you mad?

355
00:21:00,594 --> 00:21:02,304
Absolutely do not make contact.

356
00:21:02,388 --> 00:21:04,056
Even I think it's a bad idea.

357
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,433
Okay, I won't.

358
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:07,935
- On the other hand...
- Why not?

359
00:21:23,075 --> 00:21:25,995
<i>Welcome to my cul-de-sac, friend</i>

360
00:21:26,704 --> 00:21:29,540
<i>That's a street that ends in a circle</i>

361
00:21:31,292 --> 00:21:32,585
Children,

362
00:21:32,668 --> 00:21:35,254
I think the Fates have sent us
some visitors.

363
00:21:38,591 --> 00:21:40,301
Let's be good hosts.

364
00:21:41,218 --> 00:21:42,845
I'll get the door.

365
00:21:45,055 --> 00:21:48,184
Look who it is, everyone.
It's the community helpers.

366
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:50,519
We're on <i>Mister Parker's Cul De Sac.</i>

367
00:21:52,521 --> 00:21:54,023
Sewer repair?

368
00:21:54,106 --> 00:21:55,357
That's actually kind of badass.

369
00:21:55,441 --> 00:21:58,402
Could there be such a profession
as a firewoman?

370
00:21:58,486 --> 00:22:00,279
Gather around, friends.

371
00:22:00,362 --> 00:22:02,448
It's story time.

372
00:22:03,282 --> 00:22:06,410
Why don't you take a walk
around the block?

373
00:22:08,621 --> 00:22:10,706
Actually, Officer Lance,

374
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:12,124
it is a cul-de-sac...

375
00:22:13,042 --> 00:22:15,252
The logic of this world
does not compute.

376
00:22:15,336 --> 00:22:17,296
What exactly is the plan, Dr. Zari?

377
00:22:18,547 --> 00:22:19,673
I have no idea.

378
00:22:19,757 --> 00:22:23,344
We just can't keep hopping shows
ad infinitum now, can we?

379
00:22:23,427 --> 00:22:26,305
We are on public access.
This is a career-killer.

380
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:27,973
Yeah, come on, sis. What gives?

381
00:22:28,057 --> 00:22:29,391
Look, I don't know.

382
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:31,828
If you guys would just remember
who you really are,

383
00:22:31,852 --> 00:22:33,604
you could help me
figure this out, but...

384
00:22:34,313 --> 00:22:35,481
None of you remember.

385
00:22:35,564 --> 00:22:36,857
Remember what?

386
00:22:36,941 --> 00:22:38,651
That you're the Legends.

387
00:22:38,734 --> 00:22:40,194
What is a Legend?

388
00:22:44,823 --> 00:22:46,659
What is a Legend?

389
00:22:47,076 --> 00:22:49,161
You guys were heroes.

390
00:22:49,495 --> 00:22:52,665
But it's not because you do magic
or because you have superpowers, it...

391
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:56,418
What makes you guys special,
what makes us special is that

392
00:22:56,502 --> 00:22:57,878
we're just a bunch of...

393
00:22:59,171 --> 00:23:01,799
misfits who are trying to
make a difference.

394
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:04,677
<i>That is what we need right now.</i>

395
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:08,681
She's talking about us.
We can be those misfits, Gary.

396
00:23:10,099 --> 00:23:11,057
But how?

397
00:23:11,058 --> 00:23:13,435
I've been sanitizing history
for too long.

398
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:14,853
It's time to spread the truth.

399
00:23:16,522 --> 00:23:20,734
The Legends remember who they truly are.

400
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:25,281
<i>I wanna do right by Astra.</i>

401
00:23:25,614 --> 00:23:29,076
Make sure she was happy
growing up in a big house...

402
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:30,661
and I could keep an eye on her.

403
00:23:31,245 --> 00:23:33,038
<i>Your mom never gave up on you.</i>

404
00:23:33,122 --> 00:23:34,498
<i>You can really bring her back?</i>

405
00:23:34,582 --> 00:23:36,458
<i>I can fix everything.</i>

406
00:23:37,126 --> 00:23:38,419
<i>You don't belong here.</i>

407
00:23:45,968 --> 00:23:47,052
<i>As far as I'm concerned,</i>

408
00:23:47,136 --> 00:23:48,929
we are co-captains for life.

409
00:23:49,013 --> 00:23:50,013
Always.

410
00:23:56,103 --> 00:23:57,103
Sara!

411
00:23:57,813 --> 00:23:59,733
<i>We changed history,
we changed everything.</i>

412
00:24:02,651 --> 00:24:04,820
Dude, you just came back to life.

413
00:24:04,903 --> 00:24:06,822
<i>I know that I love you.</i>

414
00:24:07,239 --> 00:24:08,324
Find me.

415
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:19,418
I remember everything.

416
00:24:19,501 --> 00:24:24,131
I remember the Legends,
I remember our time with Behrad.

417
00:24:25,382 --> 00:24:28,469
I remember both Zaris.

418
00:24:29,553 --> 00:24:31,180
It's nice to be remembered.

419
00:24:33,682 --> 00:24:34,808
Behrad.

420
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,145
I should be dead.

421
00:24:38,228 --> 00:24:41,857
- In every timeline I shouldn't be alive.
- Yeah, but you're alive here. Okay, now.

422
00:24:42,733 --> 00:24:45,819
Look... I actually think
I know what happened.

423
00:24:46,737 --> 00:24:49,615
Look, I told Charlie to come up
with a way to outsmart her sisters.

424
00:24:49,698 --> 00:24:51,492
Maybe hiding us on TV was that way.

425
00:24:52,868 --> 00:24:55,913
Bloody Charlie! A butler!

426
00:24:57,373 --> 00:24:59,291
I feel violated.

427
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:01,043
What the hell, John?

428
00:25:01,126 --> 00:25:03,671
Did the Loom bring my mom back, or not?

429
00:25:03,754 --> 00:25:05,172
I'm sorry, love, I don't know.

430
00:25:06,548 --> 00:25:08,342
- Hey.
- Hi.

431
00:25:10,094 --> 00:25:11,428
You found me.

432
00:25:12,596 --> 00:25:13,972
I'm never gonna lose you again.

433
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,437
We did it, Gary!

434
00:25:21,188 --> 00:25:22,272
You idiots!

435
00:25:23,482 --> 00:25:25,859
Great Clotho! Praise the Fates!

436
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,444
What have you done?

437
00:25:27,569 --> 00:25:31,490
We restored their memories.
Please don't kill us.

438
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:33,117
You're gonna ruin everything.

439
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,160
If only we could explain...

440
00:25:35,244 --> 00:25:36,745
Silence!

441
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:41,125
I can't let the Legends escape.

442
00:25:46,547 --> 00:25:48,799
Guys, love that you're back together.

443
00:25:48,882 --> 00:25:51,343
And let's just say
that I'm processing what it means

444
00:25:51,427 --> 00:25:53,762
that my best bro
is in love with my sister,

445
00:25:53,846 --> 00:25:57,933
who lived my same experiences
in a different timeline.

446
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:00,018
But where's my Zari?

447
00:26:00,102 --> 00:26:02,646
You took the words
right outta my mouth, mate.

448
00:26:03,605 --> 00:26:06,442
Mmm-hmm. Uh...

449
00:26:07,526 --> 00:26:10,446
Well, I'm sort of possessing her body.

450
00:26:10,529 --> 00:26:12,489
I mean, I love both of you.

451
00:26:12,573 --> 00:26:14,491
- It's just...
- I get it.

452
00:26:14,575 --> 00:26:16,785
- She belongs here.
- Yeah, but what happens to you?

453
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:20,289
Did someone say "problem"?

454
00:26:20,372 --> 00:26:23,584
It sounds like being stuck
in a TV universe,

455
00:26:23,667 --> 00:26:27,796
and suddenly remembering two different
timelines is very confusing.

456
00:26:29,047 --> 00:26:31,091
Maybe I can try to help.

457
00:26:31,175 --> 00:26:33,802
I hate to question a living God,

458
00:26:33,886 --> 00:26:36,472
but why are you doing this, Clotho?

459
00:26:36,555 --> 00:26:40,392
Because the Legends don't realize that
there are consequences to disobedience.

460
00:26:40,476 --> 00:26:44,021
"I know all about sad feelings."

461
00:26:44,646 --> 00:26:46,899
I know all about sad feelings.

462
00:26:52,738 --> 00:26:55,657
<i>Sad feelings Bad feelings</i>

463
00:26:55,783 --> 00:26:58,869

464

<i>When you do just sing this song</i>

466
00:27:03,707 --> 00:27:05,602
Mr. Parker, I know
you're trying to help, but you just...

467
00:27:05,626 --> 00:27:08,420
<i>Repress, repress</i>

468
00:27:08,504 --> 00:27:11,298
<i>I'll go back and repress</i>

469
00:27:11,381 --> 00:27:14,426
<i>It's better to bury my feelings</i>

470
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:20,599
<i>Than feel as awful as this</i>

471
00:27:20,682 --> 00:27:23,185
Yeah, you're definitely not Mr. Parker.

472
00:27:33,821 --> 00:27:35,280
Where did you send them?

473
00:27:35,364 --> 00:27:38,408
I just pulled the plug
on this crossover, silly.

474
00:27:38,492 --> 00:27:40,285
You all have to go home now.

475
00:27:41,829 --> 00:27:44,790

485
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:22,536
I am so sorry.
I thought I was tackling Mr. Parker.

486
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:24,413
What kind of mush are we having tonight?

487
00:28:24,496 --> 00:28:26,915
The "you gotta go" kind, come on.

488
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:30,586
Yeah, how did we not hear that before?

489
00:28:30,669 --> 00:28:33,630
After all that,
we're right back where we started.

490
00:28:33,714 --> 00:28:36,592
Motherfater! I wanna see
the Buds break free!

491
00:28:37,676 --> 00:28:41,471
Just try and make a move on us,
and I will burn you, you bastard.

492
00:28:41,555 --> 00:28:43,181
John.

493
00:28:43,265 --> 00:28:45,893
- We need to go back.
- Yeah, sure, love.

494
00:28:46,435 --> 00:28:48,562
Why don't you really listen to her,

495
00:28:48,645 --> 00:28:50,731
construction worker John?

496
00:28:53,442 --> 00:28:54,985
I wanna see my mother.

497
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,995
You think your mother
will suddenly have all of her memories?

498
00:29:05,078 --> 00:29:08,248
What if Natalie is just a character
on a TV show, love?

499
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:11,501
I have to know for sure.

500
00:29:14,338 --> 00:29:16,298
<i>Repress</i>

501
00:29:16,381 --> 00:29:18,550
<i>Repress</i>

502
00:29:18,634 --> 00:29:22,763
<i>I'll go back and repress</i>

503
00:29:22,846 --> 00:29:27,434
<i>It's better to bury my feelings</i>

504
00:29:27,517 --> 00:29:33,649
<i>Than feel as awful as this</i>

505
00:29:35,776 --> 00:29:37,527
<i>Ignore</i>

506
00:29:37,611 --> 00:29:39,780
<i>Ignore</i>

507
00:29:39,863 --> 00:29:44,368
<i>Those pesky feelings are a chore</i>

508
00:29:44,451 --> 00:29:48,789
<i>Obey the Fates Eat your mush</i>

509
00:29:48,872 --> 00:29:55,253
<i>And you'll be happy
Just like two ladybugs</i>

510
00:29:59,633 --> 00:30:00,759
We're back.

511
00:30:00,842 --> 00:30:02,719
And it's Christmastime, apparently.

512
00:30:02,803 --> 00:30:03,971
Yep.

513
00:30:04,596 --> 00:30:06,098
Oh. There you two are.

514
00:30:06,181 --> 00:30:07,516
Mom.

515
00:30:08,976 --> 00:30:10,352
My love.

516
00:30:10,727 --> 00:30:11,979
What's all this?

517
00:30:12,062 --> 00:30:15,565
Do you remember anything?
About your life before Highcastle Abbey?

518
00:30:16,984 --> 00:30:17,984
I...

519
00:30:21,238 --> 00:30:23,865
London? Magic?

520
00:30:23,949 --> 00:30:24,950
Dad?

521
00:30:26,034 --> 00:30:27,577
What on Earth are you talking about?

522
00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:32,457
Nevermind.

523
00:30:34,001 --> 00:30:35,877
I love you, Mom.

524
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,713
Oh...

525
00:30:38,588 --> 00:30:41,508
I love you too, you goose.

526
00:30:43,093 --> 00:30:44,720
You come upstairs and change for dinner.

527
00:30:53,103 --> 00:30:54,271
Astra, listen to me.

528
00:30:54,396 --> 00:30:55,814
I know what you're gonna say.

529
00:30:56,398 --> 00:30:57,983
She's not real.

530
00:30:59,109 --> 00:31:00,485
We can stay.

531
00:31:02,112 --> 00:31:03,572
What?

532
00:31:04,364 --> 00:31:05,407
What are you playing at?

533
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:06,867
It's no trick, love.

534
00:31:12,122 --> 00:31:13,874
Astra, look at me.

535
00:31:15,208 --> 00:31:17,711
What have I got to show for myself?

536
00:31:17,794 --> 00:31:20,464
Thirty-eight crap years of pain
and broken promises.

537
00:31:20,547 --> 00:31:23,842
You wanna know what my original sin was?

538
00:31:26,386 --> 00:31:27,596
It was you.

539
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,931
Astra,

540
00:31:30,015 --> 00:31:32,851
I rail against the angels and the demons
for being arrogant bastards,

541
00:31:32,934 --> 00:31:35,896
but I'm worse than
the bloody lot of them.

542
00:31:35,979 --> 00:31:38,857
And I thought that
I could use your innocent soul

543
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,692
as a bargaining chip
to save your mother.

544
00:31:40,776 --> 00:31:41,776
Bollocks.

545
00:31:43,236 --> 00:31:45,447
If you're happy here,

546
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:47,574
then I will spend an eternity

547
00:31:47,657 --> 00:31:51,703
as ruddy Mr. Constantine
trying to make it up

548
00:31:51,787 --> 00:31:53,497
to you and Natalie.

549
00:31:55,373 --> 00:31:59,503
Is John Constantine really capable
of such a selfless act?

550
00:32:07,177 --> 00:32:11,598
Would it be acceptable to dine
at half past 7:00, Lady Astra?

551
00:32:11,681 --> 00:32:14,559
Mrs. Hutchins is running a trifle late.

552
00:32:16,478 --> 00:32:19,648
Perfectly acceptable, Mr. Constantine.

553
00:32:31,618 --> 00:32:33,537
That's one show back on track.

554
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,705
My algorithm should take care
of the rest.

555
00:32:36,873 --> 00:32:39,042
But I don't understand.

556
00:32:39,126 --> 00:32:42,420
Why are real people trapped on TV?

557
00:32:44,047 --> 00:32:46,758
The Legends, they're my friends.

558
00:32:47,801 --> 00:32:49,302
And my sisters wanted them dead.

559
00:32:49,386 --> 00:32:52,389
So... I made a deal.

560
00:32:53,473 --> 00:32:55,559
Weave the Legends
into our streaming service,

561
00:32:55,642 --> 00:32:58,812
where they help indoctrinate
the masses and...

562
00:32:59,729 --> 00:33:00,856
they could live.

563
00:33:01,106 --> 00:33:02,274
Huh.

564
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,734
I always thought of you
as the punk rock Fate.

565
00:33:04,818 --> 00:33:07,988
- I didn't have a choice!
- Nobody does here.

566
00:33:08,738 --> 00:33:11,449
But that's how it starts,
and then you get used to it.

567
00:33:11,533 --> 00:33:13,243
Obeying, I mean.

568
00:33:21,585 --> 00:33:23,336
Come on, we have to escape.

569
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:25,172
What's our course, Captains?

570
00:33:25,255 --> 00:33:27,674
Sara, wait. Let's think about this.

571
00:33:27,757 --> 00:33:30,427
What's there to think about?
We have to get back to the real world.

572
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:32,721
I know, okay? Just...

573
00:33:32,804 --> 00:33:34,389
In the real world, I saw you die.

574
00:33:34,472 --> 00:33:35,849
Okay? And it...

575
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,393
It was awful.

576
00:33:38,518 --> 00:33:41,038
And I just keep playing it
over and over again in my head, okay?

577
00:33:41,104 --> 00:33:44,357
So... Look, out there, we lost.

578
00:33:44,441 --> 00:33:47,194
But in here, we always win, Sara.

579
00:33:47,903 --> 00:33:50,405
Look... You're right.

580
00:33:50,488 --> 00:33:52,532
Okay? And that's why
Charlie did all this.

581
00:33:53,491 --> 00:33:57,120
A crew that can't die,
us beating the bad guys every time,

582
00:33:57,204 --> 00:33:59,331
it's what we asked for
back there in the pub.

583
00:34:02,751 --> 00:34:04,669
But it doesn't exist.

584
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:10,258
Ava, life is beautiful and terrible

585
00:34:10,342 --> 00:34:12,719
all at the same time.

586
00:34:12,802 --> 00:34:15,472
But if we're only living part of it...

587
00:34:16,973 --> 00:34:18,725
then we're not living at all.

588
00:34:25,148 --> 00:34:26,650
Let's get the hell out of here.

589
00:34:26,733 --> 00:34:29,903
Captains, I'm picking up
a strange transmission.

590
00:34:29,986 --> 00:34:32,072
It's from your old enemy, Don.

591
00:34:33,907 --> 00:34:35,075
<i>Captain Lance.</i>

592
00:34:35,158 --> 00:34:36,409
<i>Captain Sharpe.</i>

593
00:34:36,493 --> 00:34:39,037
<i>Old friends.</i>

594
00:34:39,204 --> 00:34:41,248
- He looks kinda hot.
- Ugh. Mom.

595
00:34:41,331 --> 00:34:43,750
- What? I'm not dead.
- That's gross.

596
00:34:44,834 --> 00:34:46,419
So, that's where Rory's been?

597
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:51,007
<i>It was foolish to think
you could escape my wrath.</i>

598
00:34:51,091 --> 00:34:54,678
Don's charging his torpedoes.
Should I raise the shields?

599
00:34:54,761 --> 00:34:58,431
Hey... You said
that we always win, right?

600
00:34:58,515 --> 00:35:01,810
What if the only way
to get Charlie to set us free is...

601
00:35:03,061 --> 00:35:04,688
We have to lose.

602
00:35:05,605 --> 00:35:07,357
What is she on about?

603
00:35:07,732 --> 00:35:09,192
<i>You left me!</i>

604
00:35:09,276 --> 00:35:12,737
<i>You left her at the center
of a dead planet!</i>

605
00:35:12,862 --> 00:35:14,406
Yeah, just get to the revenge part.

606
00:35:14,531 --> 00:35:15,907
<i>As you wish.</i>

607
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:23,999
Torpedoes incoming.
Should I take evasive maneuvers?

608
00:35:24,082 --> 00:35:26,042
Negative, Officer Maala.

609
00:35:29,087 --> 00:35:31,214
What if real people die
in the TV, Clotho?

610
00:35:31,298 --> 00:35:32,924
You have to save them.

611
00:35:41,975 --> 00:35:44,561
Torpedo impact in five,

612
00:35:44,644 --> 00:35:50,317
four, three, two... one!

613
00:35:58,575 --> 00:35:59,659
No!

614
00:35:59,743 --> 00:36:01,828
- What just happened?
- Did they die?

615
00:36:05,999 --> 00:36:07,375
What did you do?

616
00:36:10,754 --> 00:36:12,255
I canceled their show.

617
00:36:14,174 --> 00:36:15,175
<i>You idiots!</i>

618
00:36:15,258 --> 00:36:16,843
Have you any idea what you've done?

619
00:36:16,926 --> 00:36:18,762
I loved <i>Star Trip</i> and my hair.

620
00:36:18,845 --> 00:36:21,848
- Wait, where are we?
- And where are the others?

621
00:36:27,103 --> 00:36:28,438
Darling.

622
00:36:29,189 --> 00:36:31,191
But before we go in for dinner,

623
00:36:31,274 --> 00:36:33,860
just open one present.

624
00:36:38,448 --> 00:36:39,657
What's this?

625
00:36:39,783 --> 00:36:42,285
I overheard you talking
to Lord Behrad earlier.

626
00:36:42,827 --> 00:36:44,204
It's a ticket to London.

627
00:36:45,705 --> 00:36:47,040
I don't understand.

628
00:36:48,166 --> 00:36:52,504
I couldn't bear it if you sacrificed
your happiness for my own.

629
00:36:55,131 --> 00:36:58,426
But... what about Highcastle Abbey?

630
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:02,180
Please... Don't make me do this.
I can't say goodbye to you.

631
00:37:02,305 --> 00:37:03,306
Darling...

632
00:37:03,807 --> 00:37:06,017
I'll always be here.

633
00:37:06,643 --> 00:37:09,813
But you have your whole life
ahead of you.

634
00:37:10,313 --> 00:37:12,190
Be courageous, my love.

635
00:37:13,316 --> 00:37:14,818
Live it well.

636
00:37:20,657 --> 00:37:21,908
Mr. Constantine.

637
00:37:22,659 --> 00:37:23,993
Your ladyship.

638
00:37:28,665 --> 00:37:31,042
Is Lady Astra really leaving Highcastle?

639
00:37:37,924 --> 00:37:39,008
Do I have to say it?

640
00:37:40,051 --> 00:37:41,469
Say what, my lady?

641
00:37:41,553 --> 00:37:43,388
You smug bastard.

642
00:37:44,472 --> 00:37:46,349
We can't stay here.

643
00:37:51,938 --> 00:37:53,523
Nat would be proud.

644
00:37:55,567 --> 00:37:58,736
Do it fast before I change my mind.

645
00:38:11,332 --> 00:38:12,542
John, you made it.

646
00:38:12,625 --> 00:38:16,045
Yeah, just about. What about the others?

647
00:38:16,129 --> 00:38:17,755
Come on, Z.

648
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:21,426
You didn't live in a totem for a year
just to get stuck on a TV show.

649
00:38:21,885 --> 00:38:24,888
I can't go back to eating mush again.

650
00:38:24,971 --> 00:38:26,806
Not even blue mush.

651
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:28,016
Ooh!

652
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,354
Yeah, because no one should eat mush.

653
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:35,398
Ooh!

654
00:38:36,107 --> 00:38:38,443
It's horrible.

655
00:38:38,568 --> 00:38:41,988
And all the colors are deeply unnatural.

656
00:38:42,071 --> 00:38:45,658
And it has the texture of wet cement.

657
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:49,204
<i>But, Z,</i>

658
00:38:49,287 --> 00:38:52,457
<i>the Fates said we all have to eat mush.</i>

659
00:38:52,582 --> 00:38:53,833
<i>You know what, Nate?</i>

660
00:38:54,792 --> 00:38:55,960
Screw the Fates.

661
00:38:56,085 --> 00:38:57,754
Ooh!

662
00:39:01,925 --> 00:39:03,676
Those imbeciles can't do this.

663
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,803
They'll inspire an insurrection.

664
00:39:06,596 --> 00:39:09,492
- They're gonna get themselves canceled.
- They're gonna get themselves canceled.

665
00:39:09,516 --> 00:39:12,268
For too long,
we've let the Fates rule our lives!

666
00:39:12,352 --> 00:39:15,605
I happen to like mush,
but that's not the point!

667
00:39:17,023 --> 00:39:19,817
Stop being so obedient.

668
00:39:19,943 --> 00:39:23,446
Get off your couches
and take control of your lives.

669
00:39:31,454 --> 00:39:33,039
So good to see you.

670
00:39:37,001 --> 00:39:38,628
So nice to see you.

671
00:39:40,713 --> 00:39:42,715
So, hey, that was
pretty crazy back there.

672
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,634
We were, like, engaged.

673
00:39:44,717 --> 00:39:46,803
It's a good thing
we're not brainwashed anymore.

674
00:39:48,513 --> 00:39:51,307
Great. Out of the TV show,
still in heels.

675
00:39:52,308 --> 00:39:54,102
<i>You morons!</i>

676
00:39:54,185 --> 00:39:56,437
<i>You just couldn't leave it alone,
could you?</i>

677
00:39:56,521 --> 00:39:58,523
I gave you everything that you wanted.

678
00:39:58,606 --> 00:40:00,316
<i>You stuck us on TV!</i>

679
00:40:00,817 --> 00:40:03,278
I brought Sara and Behrad back to life.

680
00:40:03,361 --> 00:40:06,698
Mick, I made you a criminal again!
It's just like you wanted!

681
00:40:07,323 --> 00:40:09,576
I even gave Astra
a happy childhood for you, John-o.

682
00:40:09,659 --> 00:40:12,412
Yeah, bollocks. You just used us
to keep people under control.

683
00:40:12,537 --> 00:40:14,337
<i>It's better that, than you lot dead.</i>

684
00:40:15,999 --> 00:40:17,834
I still have your life threads.

685
00:40:17,917 --> 00:40:20,837
I can put the shows back on air,
I'll do rewrites.

686
00:40:21,713 --> 00:40:26,009
Behrad, you want the old Zari back?
I can do that. Look.

687
00:40:38,605 --> 00:40:40,857
Behrad, is that really you?

688
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,442
You're alive.

689
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:46,613
- What's happening?
- Yeah, it's like a Zari clone.

690
00:40:46,696 --> 00:40:47,864
I totally get it.

691
00:40:50,074 --> 00:40:51,868
Oh.

692
00:40:52,035 --> 00:40:54,203
Wait, what? Two sisters?

693
00:40:55,872 --> 00:40:57,874
Yeah, this is weird.

694
00:40:58,916 --> 00:41:00,460
Good weird.

695
00:41:02,045 --> 00:41:03,046
It's really you.

696
00:41:06,215 --> 00:41:09,344
Charlie, you can't bribe us
into taking the blue pill.

697
00:41:09,427 --> 00:41:12,555
I'm not bribing, I'm begging.
My sisters will kill you.

698
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:13,806
That's for sure.

699
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:15,683
Yeah, well, we'll take our chances.

700
00:41:15,767 --> 00:41:18,436
Lita's out there somewhere.

701
00:41:18,561 --> 00:41:19,729
I'm not staying here.

702
00:41:20,396 --> 00:41:21,773
Let's get out of here.

703
00:41:21,939 --> 00:41:23,566
Yeah, so long, Charlie.

704
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:25,652
Wait, just accept your fates.

705
00:41:26,736 --> 00:41:28,237
Don't walk out that door.

706
00:41:29,197 --> 00:41:31,240
On the other hand...

707
00:41:31,407 --> 00:41:32,659
Why not?

708
00:41:44,253 --> 00:41:45,797
They're free!

709
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:48,257
Then I can't help them anymore.

710
00:41:53,054 --> 00:41:55,556
<i>They're the ultimate buds</i>

711
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:58,559
<i>They're Tarazis and Nate
Terrific mates</i>

712
00:41:58,643 --> 00:42:00,645
<i>Keep watching because</i>

713
00:42:01,104 --> 00:42:03,272
<i>They've got an ultimatum</i>

714
00:42:03,398 --> 00:42:05,900
<i>And they'll follow it verbatim</i>

715
00:42:05,983 --> 00:42:08,319
<i>They're the ultimate buds</i>

716
00:42:08,444 --> 00:42:10,405
<i>And they're fated to have some fun</i>
