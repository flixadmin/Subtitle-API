1
00:00:25,556 --> 00:00:28,225
Okay. Here we go again.

2
00:00:31,311 --> 00:00:32,979
Let me break it down for you,

3
00:00:33,939 --> 00:00:36,108
four thousand soldiers...

4
00:00:37,025 --> 00:00:40,320
a 250-man team of Colombia's
elite forces...

5
00:00:42,614 --> 00:00:45,200
tens of thousands of rounds fired...

6
00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:50,497
...seven dogs...

7
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:53,292
...and four fuckin' helicopters.

8
00:00:54,501 --> 00:00:57,921
Pablo Escobar was surrounded
in the middle of fuckin' nowhere.

9
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:02,676
There was no way he was
getting out of this one... right?

10
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:43,689
Yep.

11
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:47,901
Life ain't fair, man.

12
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:52,280
Pablo Escobar? He was headed home.

13
00:04:53,031 --> 00:04:56,034
As for me and Connie, well,
we were in some deep shit,

14
00:04:56,118 --> 00:04:57,619
and I hadn't even heard the news.

15
00:04:57,703 --> 00:04:59,955
This is what I do. This is my job.

16
00:05:00,038 --> 00:05:02,374
No, don't you dare say this is your job.

17
00:05:02,457 --> 00:05:04,584
I know what your fucking job is.

18
00:05:04,668 --> 00:05:07,963
And it doesn't entail being kidnapped
by a Colombian drug cartel.

19
00:05:08,046 --> 00:05:10,799
Listen, I'm sorry, I am. I
know it must've been tough for you.

20
00:05:10,882 --> 00:05:14,845
Listen, but Connie, I was
never in any danger.

21
00:05:14,928 --> 00:05:17,180
I'm here now, back with you.

22
00:05:19,057 --> 00:05:20,183
Hmm?

23
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:25,772
All I want... is for us to be safe.

24
00:05:27,232 --> 00:05:29,712
I want to get the hell out of this
place and I want to go home.

25
00:05:39,035 --> 00:05:40,829
- Murphy.
- Escobar's out.

26
00:05:41,872 --> 00:05:43,165
- What?
- He's fucking out.

27
00:05:43,248 --> 00:05:44,786
He took Sandoval hostage during the

28
00:05:44,787 --> 00:05:48,569
siege and when the
army went in... he escaped.

29
00:05:48,628 --> 00:05:49,921
Walked right out.

30
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:58,305
Pick me up in ten minutes.
I'll meet you downstairs.

31
00:06:05,687 --> 00:06:07,564
Escobar's escaped.

32
00:06:13,695 --> 00:06:15,280
And you know what?

33
00:06:16,198 --> 00:06:18,158
I was happy about it.

34
00:06:20,076 --> 00:06:22,913
The fox was out of the cage
and the hunt was on.

35
00:06:25,707 --> 00:06:29,544
Yeah, it was the biggest law enforcement
blunder of all time.

36
00:06:29,628 --> 00:06:32,005
Fortunately, it wasn't our blunder.

37
00:11:38,937 --> 00:11:41,189
Pablo Escobar has escaped from prison.

38
00:11:47,946 --> 00:11:51,449
He is out of that prison again
after a bizarre showdown between...

39
00:11:51,533 --> 00:11:53,576
By morning, word was out on the streets

40
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,703
and all eyes were on Medellín.

41
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:59,958
This wasn't just a
manhunt... this was an invasion.

42
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,671
Gaviria was willing to go
door to door to catch Escobar.

43
00:12:04,754 --> 00:12:06,548
And we wanted to be a part of it.

44
00:12:08,424 --> 00:12:11,594
After all, we
represented America down here.

45
00:12:11,678 --> 00:12:15,014
We thought of ourselves as
the guys who could get shit done.

46
00:12:15,557 --> 00:12:18,017
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...
- Jesus Christ.

47
00:12:18,726 --> 00:12:22,021
Agent Murphy, Agent Peña. DEA.

48
00:12:27,902 --> 00:12:31,030
- Name Pinzón mean anything to you?
- No, don't know him.

49
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:35,159
You see this?

50
00:12:36,536 --> 00:12:38,536
Well, it looks like
we're not invited to the dance.

51
00:12:44,377 --> 00:12:46,537
Yeah, you mean when nothing's
left inside.

52
00:13:17,911 --> 00:13:20,014
Huh?

53
00:14:21,391 --> 00:14:23,184
Now keep in mind...

54
00:14:23,268 --> 00:14:26,479
the Medellín cartel
wasn't just one big gang.

55
00:14:26,562 --> 00:14:29,357
It was made up of a bunch
of smaller gangs.

56
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,192
A collective, so to speak.

57
00:14:31,276 --> 00:14:35,238
And as far as Pablo was concerned,
he was still their leader.

58
00:14:36,197 --> 00:14:39,409
In his mind, every trafficker in Medellín
had to pay tribute to him.

59
00:14:40,535 --> 00:14:42,787
Only a guy who'd killed
thousands of people

60
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,447
could think Judy Moncada would

61
00:14:44,472 --> 00:14:46,732
forget what he'd
done to her husband Kiko

62
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:49,335
and his business partner
Fernando Galeano,

63
00:14:49,419 --> 00:14:52,213
the guys who were running
his business while he was inside.

64
00:14:52,297 --> 00:14:55,591
Fuckin' psycho. He thought
that they were stealing from him...

65
00:14:56,551 --> 00:14:58,761
and naturally, they got the
short end of the stick.

66
00:15:07,186 --> 00:15:09,314
Why he thought Judy'd
be okay with that...

67
00:15:09,397 --> 00:15:11,983
Well, she wasn't.

68
00:15:12,734 --> 00:15:17,196
And alongside her brother Jaime,
and head of security Diego Murillo,

69
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:22,285
a.k.a. Don Berna, they'd
broken away from the Medellín cartel.

70
00:15:22,368 --> 00:15:26,122
And now that Pablo was out,
they wanted payback.

71
00:15:27,665 --> 00:15:32,128
And as for the other
gangs, they were all up for grabs.

72
00:15:35,089 --> 00:15:37,717
Take the Prisco brothers, for instance.

73
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,594
The oldest of whom, Ricardo,

74
00:15:39,677 --> 00:15:42,013
was a respected member
of the medical community.

75
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,812
He didn't know who to side with.

76
00:15:49,896 --> 00:15:52,231
Neither did the Gallón gang,

77
00:15:52,315 --> 00:15:53,858
who became famous a year later

78
00:15:53,941 --> 00:15:57,153
when they murdered Colombian
soccer player Andrés Escobar

79
00:15:57,236 --> 00:16:01,908
for accidentally scoring a goal against
his own country in the 1994 World Cup.

80
00:16:02,825 --> 00:16:06,704
But this wasn't a soccer
game. This was the blow business.

81
00:16:06,788 --> 00:16:09,467
And whose side they
chose would come down

82
00:16:09,492 --> 00:16:12,234
to two things, who offered
the better deal

83
00:16:12,293 --> 00:16:14,545
and who had the better chance
of winning the war.

84
00:19:19,772 --> 00:19:21,148
Mmm-hmm.

85
00:19:32,702 --> 00:19:34,161
- Mmm-hmm.
- Mmm?

86
00:20:04,567 --> 00:20:05,735
Mmm.

87
00:21:09,715 --> 00:21:12,259
Hmm?

88
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:29,462
Looking for a place for your
next corporate retreat?

89
00:22:29,545 --> 00:22:32,465
Or maybe a quiet getaway
for the whole family?

90
00:22:32,548 --> 00:22:38,387
How about 360 degrees of unobstructed
views of the Antioquian countryside?

91
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,892
Sixty thousand square feet
of creative living space.

92
00:22:47,062 --> 00:22:48,606
Perfect for entertaining.

93
00:22:50,649 --> 00:22:53,402
Look no further than La Catedral.

94
00:22:54,528 --> 00:22:55,571
One man's prison...

95
00:22:56,947 --> 00:22:58,616
is anyone else's palace.

96
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:05,206
Yep... it was a beautiful place.

97
00:23:05,289 --> 00:23:07,625
And when the Colombian
cops were done with it,

98
00:23:07,708 --> 00:23:10,669
they were gracious enough to
let us pick through the leftovers.

99
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:17,468
This and Mein Kampf.

100
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,387
Two classics of 20th century literature.

101
00:23:20,471 --> 00:23:23,265
Yeah, what do you think the rent's
like? I'm thinking about moving in.

102
00:23:26,143 --> 00:23:30,523
Hey, Javi, you think the, uh...
the Hague would want a couple of these?

103
00:23:30,606 --> 00:23:33,651
How are you not wearing rubber
gloves touching that shit, man?

104
00:23:44,578 --> 00:23:46,179
We should take this stuff to our office.

105
00:23:46,204 --> 00:23:48,044
It's better than any of the shit we got.

106
00:23:48,123 --> 00:23:50,321
Fuckin' Pinzón's
guys have taken everything

107
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:51,943
that's useful. There's nothing.

108
00:23:52,002 --> 00:23:53,882
Look, I think I found something
that might help.

109
00:23:53,921 --> 00:23:55,339
Oh, yeah?

110
00:23:56,966 --> 00:23:57,800
What's that?

111
00:24:02,721 --> 00:24:03,847
Wait.

112
00:26:18,148 --> 00:26:21,527
After La Catedral, the next
stop was Carlos Holguín...

113
00:26:22,653 --> 00:26:26,365
the old police training academy
that had been repurposed as ground zero

114
00:26:26,448 --> 00:26:28,283
in the search for Escobar.

115
00:26:29,993 --> 00:26:32,621
The new honcho was Colonel Pinzón,

116
00:26:32,705 --> 00:26:35,708
the guy who was famous
for his love of Uncle Sam.

117
00:26:35,791 --> 00:26:37,376
As a courtesy to your government,

118
00:26:37,459 --> 00:26:40,087
I'm allowing you to participate
in this manhunt.

119
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:45,217
But... I set the limits
and all decisions rest with me.

120
00:26:45,843 --> 00:26:49,179
If this condition is unacceptable,
take it up with the president.

121
00:26:49,263 --> 00:26:51,515
Of course, Colonel.

122
00:26:51,598 --> 00:26:53,350
I hope we didn't get
off on the wrong foot.

123
00:26:53,434 --> 00:26:56,895
Not at all. Every operation
needs a well-defined hierarchy.

124
00:27:08,449 --> 00:27:11,869
I hope this will be an
adequate space for you to do your work.

125
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,923
What, you're talking about this? This...

126
00:27:14,948 --> 00:27:16,355
This is more than adequate.

127
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,961
- Gracias, Colonel.
- Welcome.

128
00:27:26,091 --> 00:27:28,302
Oh, wow, this is from 1962.

129
00:27:35,058 --> 00:27:37,269
Like most tricks Pablo employed,

130
00:27:37,352 --> 00:27:41,440
the audacity and simplicity
of the taxi was pretty damn good.

131
00:27:42,191 --> 00:27:45,527
I mean, who in the hell would think
that the seventh richest man in the world

132
00:27:45,611 --> 00:27:48,572
would be riding around in the
trunk of a piece of shit taxi?

133
00:27:50,949 --> 00:27:53,307
As smart as it was,
Pablo wasn't the kind

134
00:27:53,332 --> 00:27:55,353
of guy who left anything to chance.

135
00:27:56,079 --> 00:27:59,374
Despite his absence, he still
had a loyal following in Medellín.

136
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:05,464
And a network of spotters...
kids mainly.

137
00:28:06,131 --> 00:28:08,383
And they were everywhere in the comunas.

138
00:28:09,843 --> 00:28:12,679
The spotters could identify
which streets to take

139
00:28:12,763 --> 00:28:14,807
and which ones to avoid.

140
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:22,517
Mmm.

141
00:32:26,683 --> 00:32:30,103
Seriously? Directly in front of me?

142
00:32:30,187 --> 00:32:32,147
I don't spend enough time
looking at your face?

143
00:32:35,275 --> 00:32:36,443
That's better.

144
00:32:45,035 --> 00:32:46,453
Nothing?

145
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,333
You picked up the "American"
part, right?

146
00:32:52,626 --> 00:32:54,544
Murphy!

147
00:33:56,022 --> 00:33:58,608
- You think it's legit?
- Let's find out.

148
00:34:11,955 --> 00:34:13,832
How credible is your source?

149
00:34:13,915 --> 00:34:15,656
It was an unsolicited phone call.

150
00:34:15,681 --> 00:34:17,610
She asked to speak to an American.

151
00:34:17,669 --> 00:34:19,605
We would just need a
couple of cars and a few men.

152
00:34:19,629 --> 00:34:22,674
Well, my men are either busy
here or outside in the street.

153
00:34:22,757 --> 00:34:25,886
And I'm not relocating men
to chase down bullshit tips.

154
00:34:25,969 --> 00:34:29,014
If this turns out not to be bullshit,
La Quica could give us Pablo.

155
00:34:30,974 --> 00:34:33,310
So go. Go ahead.

156
00:34:33,393 --> 00:34:35,812
Since when do you need an excuse
to go to a whorehouse?

157
00:34:49,242 --> 00:34:51,203
One vehicle, three men.

158
00:34:51,286 --> 00:34:52,496
Gracias.

159
00:39:03,329 --> 00:39:06,583
Alleys run along the
house here... and here.

160
00:39:06,666 --> 00:39:09,419
We'll keep the other car
waiting around back.

161
00:39:19,387 --> 00:39:22,015
- Murphy.
- Hey, it's me.

162
00:39:22,098 --> 00:39:23,975
Hey, honey. Um...

163
00:39:24,058 --> 00:39:26,939
I'm just in the middle of something.
Let me call you right back.

164
00:39:27,604 --> 00:39:29,230
We're at the airport.

165
00:39:30,732 --> 00:39:32,066
You're where?

166
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:33,276
I can't do this.

167
00:39:34,152 --> 00:39:36,780
I'm taking Olivia and we're
going back to Miami.

168
00:39:36,863 --> 00:39:38,466
No, no, no. Listen to me, please.

169
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:41,075
Please, you can't just
do it like this. You can't.

170
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:44,829
My sister's offered to help us out for
a while, so we'll be there if you need us.

171
00:39:44,913 --> 00:39:45,747
Connie.

172
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:49,209
It's not right, Steve, to keep Olivia
here with everything that's going on.

173
00:39:49,292 --> 00:39:51,002
Not when I can take her someplace safe.

174
00:39:51,085 --> 00:39:53,856
You're safe in Bogotá. You're
right beside the goddamn fuckin' embassy.

175
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,280
Look, I have to go.

176
00:39:56,341 --> 00:40:00,345
Connie, please. We can talk about this.
Do not get on that airplane. Wait, okay?

177
00:40:00,428 --> 00:40:01,781
I'll be right there. I'm on my way.

178
00:40:01,805 --> 00:40:04,390
I'm sorry.

179
00:40:05,683 --> 00:40:09,395
Hey, hey, hey. I'm here. Okay?

180
00:40:11,856 --> 00:40:13,858
- She's at the airport.
- Go.

181
00:40:13,942 --> 00:40:17,237
I'm sorry. I gotta go. Guys, sorry.

182
00:40:18,696 --> 00:40:19,989
All right.

183
00:42:28,701 --> 00:42:29,729
Flight to Miami.

184
00:42:29,754 --> 00:42:32,646
Gate 39, but... Sir, you can't go. Sir!

185
00:42:32,705 --> 00:42:34,226
I'm DEA. I need to get on this flight.

186
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:37,460
I'm sorry, sir... Sir, I'm
sorry, but the plane has already left.

187
00:42:41,923 --> 00:42:43,758
Sir, please. You can't be here.

188
00:42:44,592 --> 00:42:45,677
Sir!

189
00:42:59,399 --> 00:43:01,109
Just fuckin' drive.

190
00:43:31,472 --> 00:43:33,224
Enjoy.

191
00:43:42,233 --> 00:43:45,403
- Get you feeling pretty good?
- Huh?

192
00:43:46,946 --> 00:43:49,323
Oh, fuck. Thanks, man. Shit.

193
00:43:49,407 --> 00:43:51,617
Phew!

194
00:43:51,701 --> 00:43:54,912
You wouldn't imagine what
a kilo of that stuff cost.

195
00:43:56,164 --> 00:43:57,373
Come on.

196
00:43:57,457 --> 00:44:00,126
- How about you, golden boy?
- What are you talking about, man?

197
00:44:01,044 --> 00:44:03,755
Time it's processed, shipped,

198
00:44:03,838 --> 00:44:09,844
distributed to your buddies on...
the Upper East Side? Yeah.

199
00:44:09,927 --> 00:44:13,306
Hey, man, we don't need
any problems here. We cool?

200
00:44:20,897 --> 00:44:22,231
Six.

201
00:44:23,274 --> 00:44:24,734
Lives.

202
00:44:26,569 --> 00:44:27,862
That's how much it cost.

203
00:44:27,945 --> 00:44:29,655
What do you think about that?

204
00:44:29,739 --> 00:44:33,409
That was six people.
Six people were murdered

205
00:44:33,493 --> 00:44:36,996
every time you and your
buddy over there...

206
00:44:37,872 --> 00:44:40,249
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Yeah?

207
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:51,594
Whoo!

208
00:47:45,434 --> 00:47:46,644
Fuck.

209
00:47:48,646 --> 00:47:49,647
Fuck.
