1
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,844
Valar Morghulis.

2
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,127
Valar Dohaeris.

3
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,530
I've been sweeping this floor for days.

4
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,647
Good.

5
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,609
I didn't come here to sweep floors.

6
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,007
No? Why come, then?

7
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,525
You said I could be your apprentice.

8
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,651
You said you'd teach me
how to be a Faceless Man.

9
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,689
A man teaches a girl.

10
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,890
Valar Dohaeris. All men must serve.

11
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,042
Faceless Men most of all.

12
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,006
I want to serve.

13
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,082
A girl wants to serve herself.

14
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,288
Here we serve the Many-Faced God.

15
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,850
To serve well,

16
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,488
a girl must become no one.

17
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,130
Which one's the Many-Faced God?

18
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,523
I see the Stranger. I see the Drowned God.
I see the weirwood face.

19
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,001
There is only one god.

20
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,241
A girl knows his name.

21
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,967
And all men know his gift.

22
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,602
Where are they taking him?

23
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,643
- Queen Margaery!
- Queen Margaery!

24
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,568
Queen Margaery!

25
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,722
Queen Margaery!

26
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,287
Queen Margaery!

27
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,649
- I am his and he is mine.
- I am hers and she is mine.

28
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,122
From this day until the end of my days.

29
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,850
Did I hurt you?

30
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,327
No. You were lovely.

31
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,643
- It all happened so fast.
- Yes.

32
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,000
I was scared maybe I hurt you.

33
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,085
- It sounded like...
- No, no, no.

34
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,650
You're very sweet.

35
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,005
The sweetest king who ever lived.

36
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,924
This is all I want to do all day,
every day, for the rest of my life.

37
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,680
Wouldn't that be glorious?

38
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,890
Shouldn't we rest a little while?

39
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,770
Just to catch our breath?
There's no rush, is there?

40
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,966
Of course not.

41
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,566
Are you hungry?

42
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,086
Should I have them bring you
some cake or pomegranate juice?

43
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,083
No, I'm fine.

44
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,004
I just want you all to myself.

45
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:26,849
I want to know everything there is to know
about King Tommen, First of His Name.

46
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,649
King Tommen.

47
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,604
Still sounds strange to me.

48
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,769
Does Queen Margaery sound strange to you?

49
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,601
So strange.

50
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,603
- Husband.
- Wife.

51
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,967
Sometimes it feels odd.

52
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,644
I'm the king,

53
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,008
I've married the most
beautiful woman in the world,

54
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,485
and it's all because my brother died.

55
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,003
I understand.

56
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,363
But it's not your fault.
You know that, don't you?

57
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,204
You mustn't feel guilty.

58
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,249
I don't feel guilty.

59
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,565
That's what's odd.

60
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,206
Do you like to sail?

61
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,201
I love to sail.

62
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,522
I do, too.

63
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,571
I think we're going to be very happy,
you and I.

64
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,651
I do, too.

65
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,491
Living in a tower
so high it touches the clouds.

66
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,524
Of course, my grandmother
couldn't wait to go home.

67
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,206
The capital's not for everyone, I suppose.

68
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,408
Does your mother like it here?

69
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,050
I don't think so.

70
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,447
She told me
never to trust anyone in King's Landing.

71
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,923
It's so wonderful
to have her watching over you.

72
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,128
A lioness guarding her cub.

73
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,647
Well, but I'm a man now.

74
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,211
You are.

75
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,285
And the king.

76
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,690
But you'll always be her baby boy.

77
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,205
I suppose.

78
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,960
I adore her. She's always been
so generous with me, so kind.

79
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,088
And the horrors she's had to endure...

80
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,969
Losing her husband,
her eldest child, and her father.

81
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,651
It's no wonder she's so protective of you.

82
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,451
She'll never let you out of her sight.

83
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,928
You look very much in love.

84
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,287
The first days of marriage
are often so blissful.

85
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,130
She's certainly very pretty, isn't she?

86
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,170
Like a doll. She smiles quite a lot.

87
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,082
Do you think she's intelligent?

88
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,564
I can't quite tell.

89
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,760
Not that it matters.

90
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,410
Do you ever miss Casterly Rock?

91
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,608
There's nothing for me in Casterly Rock.

92
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,890
That's where you grew up.

93
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,882
You always told me
that you liked the people there better.

94
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,929
You said that King's Landing
smelled of horse dung and sour milk.

95
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,129
Why are we speaking of Casterly Rock?

96
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,041
The way that you talked about it,

97
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,407
I always thought that you missed it.

98
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,130
That you...

99
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,201
That it was your real home.

100
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,409
This is my real home now,
where my family lives.

101
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,888
I want you to be happy, Mother.

102
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,565
I know that.

103
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,645
I know you do. My sweet boy.

104
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,802
But wouldn't you be happier
in Casterly Rock?

105
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,928
I said,
"Darling, surely four times is enough.

106
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,889
"Are you trying to set a new record?"

107
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,567
He said, "Well, what is the record?
I'm sure we can break it."

108
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,570
Mother.

109
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,491
Welcome.

110
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,370
Don't you look lovely?
Marriage agrees with you.

111
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,171
Can we bring you anything to eat or drink?

112
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,050
I wish we had some wine for you.
It's a bit early in the day for us.

113
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,001
No, no, I can't stay.

114
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:13,687
I just wanted to let you know if there's
ever anything I can do for you...

115
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,683
You are very sweet.

116
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,762
Tommen seems quite taken
with his new queen.

117
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,446
I absolutely adore him.

118
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,043
You raised a gallant young man.
I'm forever grateful.

119
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,491
Good.

120
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,246
Good. I'm glad to hear you're happy.

121
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,766
Ecstatic. I really am.

122
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,604
Exhausted, to be honest.

123
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,969
But what could I expect?
He is half lion, half stag.

124
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,529
I'll leave you to it, then.

125
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,563
Oh, forgive me.

126
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,160
I haven't been at court for long.
I get so confused.

127
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,402
What's the proper way to address you now?

128
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,841
Queen Mother or Dowager Queen?

129
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,409
There's no need for such formalities.

130
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,962
In any event,
judging from the king's enthusiasm,

131
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,088
the Queen Mother will be
a Queen Grandmother soon.

132
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,764
Won't that be a lovely day?

133
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,890
Can you imagine the celebrations?
They'll ring the bells all day and night.

134
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,644
Remember,

135
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,047
anything you need.

136
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,331
We can't hold the North
with terror alone.

137
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,926
You can't hold the North
if you let these lesser lords insult us.

138
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,651
I sent you there to collect taxes,
not bodies.

139
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,610
Lord Cerwyn refused to pay.

140
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,041
Said the Warden of the North
would always be a Stark,

141
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,691
and he'd be damned
if he'd kiss a traitor's boot.

142
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,482
He left you no choice.

143
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,451
I flayed him living,
along with his wife and brother.

144
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,488
Made his son watch.

145
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,041
And?

146
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,441
The new Lord Cerwyn paid his taxes.

147
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,442
I've something important to tell you.

148
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,761
Stop eating and listen.

149
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:23,363
We don't have enough men to hold the North
if the other houses rise up against us.

150
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,726
Do you understand that?

151
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,365
Our pact with the Lannisters protects...

152
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,442
I had a pact with Tywin Lannister.

153
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,887
And Tywin Lannister is dead.

154
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,964
The remaining Lannisters are a thousand
miles away dealing with that fact.

155
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,847
They've never once,
in the history of the Seven Kingdoms,

156
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,843
sent their army this far north.

157
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,002
If you think they will
for us, you're a fool.

158
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,402
We've become a great house by entering
into alliances with other houses,

159
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,768
and parlaying those alliances
into greater power.

160
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:54,880
The best way to forge a lasting alliance
isn't by peeling a man's skin off.

161
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,450
The best way is marriage.

162
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,247
Now that you're a Bolton by royal decree,

163
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,051
it's high time you married
a suitable bride.

164
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,164
And as it happens,

165
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,483
I've found the perfect girl
to solidify our hold on the North.

166
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,125
That's Moat Cailin.

167
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,647
Yes, a bit shabby, isn't it?

168
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,961
You've been here before?

169
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:46,045
On our way down to King's Landing
with my father and Arya.

170
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,041
Where are you taking me?

171
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,645
Home.

172
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,244
The Boltons have Winterfell.

173
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,281
Your marriage proposal, it wasn't for you.

174
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,641
No.

175
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,324
Roose Bolton murdered my brother.
He betrayed my family.

176
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,925
He did.

177
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,889
He serves the Lannisters.

178
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,325
For now.

179
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,687
- I won't go.
- Winterfell is your home.

180
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,240
- Not anymore.
- Always.

181
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,324
You're a Stark.
Dying your hair doesn't change that.

182
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:25,247
You're Sansa Stark, eldest surviving child
of Ned and Catelyn Stark.

183
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,651
Your place is in the North.

184
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,884
I can't marry him. You can't make me.
He is a traitor. A murderer!

185
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,928
You're not marrying Roose Bolton.

186
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,447
No, you'll be marrying
his son and heir, Ramsay.

187
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,369
One day he'll be Warden of the North
and you...

188
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,726
- No.
- Sansa.

189
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:44,522
No, you can't make me. I will starve myself.
I will die before I have to go there.

190
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,888
I won't force you to do anything.

191
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,566
Don't you know by now
how much I care for you?

192
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,966
Say the word and we turn the horses around,
but listen to me.

193
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,644
Listen.

194
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,809
You've been running all your life.

195
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,851
Terrible things happen to your family
and you weep.

196
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,049
You sit alone in a darkened room
mourning their fates.

197
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:09,523
You've been a bystander to tragedy
from the day they executed your father.

198
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,171
Stop being a bystander. Do you hear me?

199
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,446
Stop running.

200
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,961
There's no justice in the world.

201
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,249
Not unless we make it.

202
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,724
You loved your family.

203
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,487
Avenge them.

204
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,885
Banners!

205
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,770
How do we get through there?

206
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,006
We don't.

207
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,970
We go around.

208
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,520
Takes us miles out of the way.

209
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,840
We'll lose sight of them.

210
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,969
Doesn't matter.
I know where they're going.

211
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,281
Aren't you getting a bit
old to be a squire?

212
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,568
How did you end up squiring for the Imp?

213
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,447
He hates that nickname.

214
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,887
Well, he's not here to complain about it,
is he?

215
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,241
I squired for a knight named Ser Lorimer
during the War of the Five Kings.

216
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,483
One night, he had a bit too much to drink,

217
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,166
and he was famished, so he borrowed a ham.

218
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,321
He borrowed it?

219
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,686
He wasn't a thief.

220
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,041
He was drunk, and hungry,
and he wasn't thinking.

221
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,368
I was drunk, too.

222
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,487
He gave me half the ham.

223
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,646
Next morning,
one of the guards saw him passed out

224
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,691
under a wagon
with the hambone still in his hand.

225
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,729
They hanged him that afternoon.

226
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,280
They tied the noose for me, too,

227
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,405
but Lord Tywin heard
my family name was Payne,

228
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,766
so he pardoned me,

229
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,320
and sent me to King's Landing
to squire for his son.

230
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,722
As punishment for both of you.

231
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,689
It didn't seem that way.

232
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,524
Lord Tyrion was always very good to me.

233
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,921
Yes, all your lords have
been very kind to you.

234
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,684
All except me.

235
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,127
Sorry, you had to squire
for such a nasty person.

236
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,282
I'm not sorry.
You're the best fighter I've ever seen.

237
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,845
You beat the Hound.

238
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,002
I'm proud to be your squire.

239
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,281
I'm sorry I'm always snapping at you.

240
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,681
If you didn't snap at me,
I wouldn't learn anything.

241
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,561
You want to be a knight, Pod?

242
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,721
Yes.

243
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,565
Starting tomorrow,
we'll train with the sword twice a day,

244
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,246
before we ride in the morning
and after you make camp in the evening.

245
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,044
And I'm going to show you
how to ride properly.

246
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,121
Thank you.

247
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,601
I can't knight you,
but I can teach you how to fight.

248
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,523
I suppose that's more important.

249
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,202
You weren't a knight,

250
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,045
but you were a Kingsguard
to Renly Baratheon, weren't you?

251
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,605
I was.

252
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,001
Lord Tyrion said he was a good man.

253
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,520
He was.

254
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,804
How did you end up serving Renly?

255
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,211
When I was a girl, my father held a ball.

256
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,966
I'm his only living child,
so he wanted to make a good match for me.

257
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,611
He invited dozens of young lords to Tarth.

258
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,490
I didn't want to go,
but he dragged me to the ballroom.

259
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,643
And it was wonderful.

260
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,601
None of the boys noticed
how mulish and tall I was.

261
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,648
They shoved each other
and threatened to duel

262
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,007
when they thought it was
their turn to dance.

263
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,449
They whispered in my ear

264
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,161
how they wanted to marry me
and take me back to their castles.

265
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,523
My father smiled at me,
and I smiled at him.

266
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,287
I had never been so happy.

267
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,881
Till I saw a few of the boys sniggering.

268
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,365
And then they all started to laugh.

269
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,489
They couldn't keep
the game going any longer.

270
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,244
They were toying with me.

271
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,281
"Brienne the Beauty," they called me.
Great joke.

272
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,527
And I realized I was the
ugliest girl alive.

273
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,450
A great lumbering beast.

274
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,766
I tried to run away,
but Renly Baratheon took me in his arms.

275
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,450
"Don't let them see your
tears," he told me.

276
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,363
"They're nasty little shits,

277
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,330
"and nasty little shits
aren't worth crying over."

278
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,887
He danced with me, and none of
the other boys could say a word.

279
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,128
Renly was the king's brother after all.

280
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,404
But wasn't he...

281
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,244
Lord Tyrion said he was...

282
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,123
Yes, Pod, he liked men. I'm not an idiot.

283
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,889
He didn't love me. He didn't want me.

284
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:09,681
He danced with me because he was kind,
and didn't want to see me hurt.

285
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,644
He saved me from being a joke.

286
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:17,281
From that day until his last day.

287
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,247
And I couldn't save him in return.

288
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,401
Nothing's more hateful
than failing to protect the one you love.

289
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,682
One day I will avenge King Renly.

290
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,607
But you said a shadow murdered him.

291
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,727
How do you fight a shadow?

292
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,287
A shadow with the face
of Stannis Baratheon.

293
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,646
I know it was Stannis.
I know it in my heart.

294
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,842
Stannis is a man, not a shadow.

295
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:56,526
And a man can be killed.

296
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,441
- Lord Commander.
- Your Grace.

297
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,363
I'd like to speak alone.

298
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,681
Olly is my steward now,

299
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,047
as I was Lord Commander Mormont's.

300
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:12,526
I want him to attend my meetings
to learn from men with experience.

301
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,728
One day he might command.

302
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,361
Very well.

303
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,608
Have you considered my offer?

304
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,286
I have.

305
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,448
And I thank you for it.
You do me great honor.

306
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,961
All my life I wanted to be Jon Stark.

307
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,605
Say the word and you will be.

308
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,330
But I have to refuse you.

309
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,406
I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.

310
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,131
My place is here.

311
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,090
I'm giving you the chance
to avenge your family,

312
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,691
to take back the castle where you grew up.

313
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,842
To rule the North.

314
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,241
I wish I could fight beside you.

315
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,209
Believe me, I do.

316
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:01,409
But I swore a sacred vow at the godswood.

317
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,610
I pledged my life to the Night's Watch.

318
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,603
You're as stubborn as your father.

319
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,601
And as honorable.

320
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,845
I can imagine no higher praise.

321
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,081
I didn't mean it as praise.

322
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,564
Honor got your father killed.

323
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,443
But if your mind's made up,
I won't try and dissuade you.

324
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,842
May I ask how long you plan
to stay at Castle Black?

325
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,490
Are you bored of us already?

326
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:27,442
You saved us from Mance Rayder's army.
We will never forget that.

327
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,690
But it's a question of survival.

328
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,411
The Night's Watch can't continue
to feed your men

329
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,211
and the wildling prisoners indefinitely.

330
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,361
Winter is coming.

331
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,645
I know it.

332
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,930
We march on Winterfell within the
fortnight, before the snows trap us here.

333
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,366
And the wildlings?

334
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,642
If they'd rather burn than fight for me,
so be it.

335
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,960
I leave their fate to you.

336
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,044
You could execute them.
That's the safest course.

337
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,129
Or you could see if this Tormund fellow

338
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,851
is more willing to compromise
than Mance ever was.

339
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:07,288
I assume the brothers of the Night's Watch
would rather see the wildlings dead.

340
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,249
Most of the brothers, yes.

341
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,961
There's little love for the free folk here.

342
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:16,647
You're the Lord Commander. Your decision.

343
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,764
You have many enemies in Castle Black.

344
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,844
Have you considered
sending Alliser Thorne elsewhere?

345
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,806
Give him command of Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.

346
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,247
I heard it was best
to keep your enemies close.

347
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,641
Whoever said that didn't have many enemies.

348
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,330
He sees something in you.

349
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,851
Might not be apparent from his tone,
but it's the truth.

350
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,206
He believes in you.

351
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,448
I'm sorry I disappointed him.

352
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,688
The king is a complicated man,

353
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,281
but he wants to do what's right
for the Seven Kingdoms.

354
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,725
As long as he's ruling them.

355
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,529
He's the one true king.

356
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,169
He has a blood right to that throne.

357
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,926
I've sworn to stay clear of the politics
of the Seven Kingdoms.

358
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,240
Have you now?

359
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,887
How does the Night's Watch vow go again?

360
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,926
I'll bet you've got it memorized
since you got here.

361
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,648
Night gathers and now my watch begins.

362
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,644
No, not that bit. The bit at the end.

363
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,801
I am the sword in the darkness,

364
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,644
the watcher on the walls,

365
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,563
the shield that guards the realms of men.

366
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,649
- I pledge my life...
- Right, that's enough.

367
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,121
The shield that guards the realms of men.

368
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,241
That's what you swore to be.

369
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,325
Now, I'm not a learned man,

370
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,686
but the best way to help the most people

371
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,923
might not be sitting in a frozen castle
at the edge of the world.

372
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,926
It just might mean wading in the muck,
getting your boots dirty,

373
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,968
and doing what needs to be done.

374
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,371
And what needs to be done?

375
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,286
As long as the Boltons rule the North,
the North will suffer.

376
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,290
Just one man's opinion.

377
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,961
What do you want?

378
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,924
Who are you?

379
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,241
What?

380
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:40,723
You, who walk in here
with a coin you never earned,

381
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,802
whose value you do not respect.

382
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,361
Who are you?

383
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,001
No one.

384
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,721
Ow!

385
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,847
- Cunt!
- A lie.

386
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,163
A sad little lie. Who are you?

387
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,321
I told you, I'm...

388
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,286
Do that again, and...

389
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,925
Who are you?

390
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,084
You're about to find out.

391
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,209
What are you doing?

392
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,965
We were only playing. The Game of Faces.

393
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,162
- A girl is not ready.
- Clearly not.

394
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,641
I am ready.

395
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,727
For what?

396
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,406
For whatever you want.

397
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,171
To be a Faceless Man. To be no one.

398
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,249
Whose sword is that?

399
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,765
It belongs to Arya Stark.

400
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,970
Arya Stark's sword, clothes, stolen silver.

401
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,247
A man wonders,

402
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:43,531
how is it that no one came to be
surrounded by Arya Stark's things?

403
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,726
What do we do with them after we wash them?

404
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:22,846
Open gate!

405
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,167
Honor guard, stand to!

406
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,001
Hold up. Easy.

407
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,651
Lady Sansa. Welcome.

408
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,771
Lord Bolton.

409
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,121
May I introduce my son, Ramsay Bolton?

410
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:18,367
It's an honor to meet you, my lady.

411
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:37,491
I'll bring you a bowl of hot water.
You must want to wash.

412
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,925
Thank you.

413
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,520
Welcome home, Lady Stark.

414
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,248
The North remembers.

415
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,967
Sam?

416
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,405
Maester Aemon?

417
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,608
He apologizes for not being here.

418
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,930
He's not feeling well.

419
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,206
Take good care of him.

420
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,765
Brothers.

421
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,725
As you all know too well, it's long
past time to dig a new latrine pit.

422
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,923
First Builder Yarvvyck and I
have decided to appoint a latrine captain

423
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,843
to oversee this crucial task.

424
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,085
Brian.

425
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,607
Seems like a good job for a ginger.

426
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,128
- That's him!
- That's him.

427
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,761
Ser Alliser.

428
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:57,648
You have more experience
than any other ranger at Castle Black.

429
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,087
You proved your valor many times over

430
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,288
while defending the Wall
from the wildling attack.

431
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,443
I name you First Ranger.

432
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,646
Hear, hear!

433
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,768
Lord Janos.
I'm giving you command of Greyguard.

434
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,680
Greyguard is a ruin.

435
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,805
Yes, the fort is in a sorry state.
Restore it as best you can.

436
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,689
First Builder Yarvvyck
can spare 10 of his...

437
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,364
I was charged
with the defense of King's Landing

438
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,408
when you were soiling
your swaddling clothes.

439
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,686
Keep your ruin.

440
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:38,921
All right! That's enough of that.

441
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,684
You mistake me, my lord.

442
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,562
That was a command, not an offer.

443
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,848
Pack your arms and armor,
say your farewells,

444
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,402
and ride for Greyguard.

445
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,570
I will not go meekly off to freeze and die.

446
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,690
Give it to one of the fools
who cast a stone for you.

447
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:04,129
I will not have it. Did you hear me, boy?
I will not have it!

448
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,726
Are you refusing to obey my order?

449
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,723
You can stick your order
up your bastard ass.

450
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,406
Take Lord Janos outside.

451
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,480
Olly, bring me my sword.

452
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,081
- Get out.
- You cannot do this!

453
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,645
Get your hands off me! Scum, all of you!

454
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,604
If the boy thinks he can frighten me,
he's mistaken.

455
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,920
Yes, very mistaken.

456
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,684
Disgrace!

457
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,161
I have friends.
Important friends in the capital.

458
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,691
- You'll see.
- Kneel!

459
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:53,883
If you have any last words, my lord,
now's the time.

460
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:01,409
I was wrong. You're the Lord Commander.
We all serve you. I'm sorry.

461
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,689
Not only for this, for
all I've done and said.

462
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,725
I was wrong.

463
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,082
My lord, please! Mercy! Mercy!

464
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,804
I'll go! I will!

465
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,481
Please.

466
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,446
I'm afraid.

467
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,607
I've always been afraid.

468
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:08,449
You have served us well, my son.

469
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,886
Thank you, Father.

470
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,006
Which of the Seven will you worship today?

471
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,127
The Maiden.

472
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,881
Always the Maiden.

473
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,170
And the Stranger.

474
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,444
- Two is extra, you realize?
- Yes, yes.

475
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,167
What are you doing?

476
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,886
This establishment belongs
to Lord Petyr Baelish. You can't...

477
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,003
You have profaned our faith,

478
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,124
the faith of our fathers and forefathers.

479
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,282
I am the High Septon of the...

480
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,522
You are a sinner.

481
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,443
And you shall be punished.

482
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,041
Ah!

483
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,288
- Sinner.
- Sinner.

484
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,044
- Sinner. Sinner.
- Repent!

485
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,326
Sinner.

486
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,370
Sinner.

487
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,807
Sinner. Sinner.

488
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,087
- Shame on you.
- Sinner.

489
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,644
Your Grace, Grand Maester, Lord Tyrell...

490
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,321
Uh...

491
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,045
it doesn't matter.

492
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,247
As the High Septon of
the Faith of the Seven,

493
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:43,247
I give voice to the will of the gods and
am their foremost servant in this world.

494
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:46,290
An insult to me is an insult to the gods.

495
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,530
An assault on my person
is an assault on our very religion.

496
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,170
- You were assaulted?
- I was.

497
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,687
By those fanatics
who call themselves Sparrows.

498
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,924
They humiliated me, they beat me,

499
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,004
they left me naked and bleeding
on the cobblestones.

500
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,650
I am lucky to be alive.

501
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:04,690
I heard this assault
began in Littlefinger's brothel.

502
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,651
This is a rather shocking thing to hear.

503
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,451
I tend to both the highest born
and the lowliest amongst us.

504
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,761
Even prostitutes
may earn the mercy of the Mother.

505
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:17,606
So, you were ministering
to the needs of these devout prostitutes?

506
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,729
A man's private affairs
ought to stay private.

507
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,209
What do you want from us, High Septon?

508
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,805
Justice.

509
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,120
I ask that you protect our faith

510
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:31,046
by arresting these criminals
and throwing them in the Black Cells.

511
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:34,920
I ask that you execute their leader,
this so-called High Sparrow.

512
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,288
He's a threat to everything we hold sacred.
If he goes unpunished...

513
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,964
And where do I find this man?

514
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,803
This High Sparrow?

515
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,963
I don't think this is a good idea.

516
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:57,169
Nonsense, Ser Meryn.
These are deeply religious people.

517
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,567
Where can I find the High Sparrow?

518
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,443
Seven blessings.

519
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,407
- Thank you.
- Just a little more.

520
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,091
Thank you.

521
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:24,881
Thank you.

522
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,401
A young man said I'd find
the High Sparrow back here.

523
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:31,484
- Where is he?
- High Sparrow?

524
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:32,971
Sounds ridiculous, doesn't it?

525
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,762
Like Lord Duckling or King Turtle.

526
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,604
Still, it's meant to.

527
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:41,684
We're often stuck with the names
our enemies give to us.

528
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:45,208
The notion that we're all equal
in the eyes of the Seven

529
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,602
doesn't sit well with some,
so they belittle me.

530
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:49,886
Seven blessings to you.

531
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:52,122
Seven blessings to you, my dear.

532
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,527
It's only a name.
Quite an easy burden to bear.

533
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,523
Far easier than hers.

534
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,641
Why no shoes?

535
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:06,128
Because I gave them away
to someone who needed them more.

536
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,201
We all do that.

537
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:11,922
It stops us from forgetting
what we really are.

538
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,731
Is that why you came to King's Landing?

539
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,245
To remind everyone?

540
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:19,608
Everyone? Hard enough job
reminding myself.

541
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:24,049
Well, I tell them no one's special, and
they think I'm special for telling them so.

542
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:26,801
Perhaps they're right.

543
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:31,164
It would be comforting to believe that,
wouldn't it?

544
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,686
Have the gods sent you here to tempt me?

545
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,525
I hope not.

546
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:42,611
I had assumed
you'd only come here to arrest me

547
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:44,523
for that incident with the High Septon.

548
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:47,886
An unacceptable way
to treat the chosen representative

549
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:50,611
of the gods in this
world, wouldn't you say?

550
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:53,047
Hypocrisy is a boil.

551
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:56,647
Lancing a boil is never pleasant.

552
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,121
Although they could have been
more careful with the blade.

553
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:03,610
The High Septon came to speak to me today.

554
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:07,606
He doesn't want me to arrest you.
He wants me to execute you.

555
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:13,729
I wouldn't presume
to know your thoughts on the matter.

556
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,722
My thoughts on the matter
are in line with your own.

557
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,246
The High Septon's behavior was corrosive,
as was his attitude.

558
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:28,365
Having a man like that reside in the sept
eats away at the faith from the inside.

559
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:32,803
So now he resides
in the Red Keep dungeons instead.

560
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,962
The faith and the crown are the two pillars
that hold up this world.

561
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,122
One collapses, so does the other.

562
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:45,770
We must do everything necessary
to protect one another.

563
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:05,647
Your Grace.

564
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,366
Send a raven with this message
to Littlefinger at the Eyrie,

565
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:10,647
or wherever he's slithering about.

566
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,205
At once, Your Grace.

567
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,686
How's your work coming along?

568
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,205
Very well.

569
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:20,884
You've made progress?

570
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,530
More than I expected.

571
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:25,246
- Still a way to go, but...
- Very good.

572
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:26,930
I'll leave you to it, then.

573
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,289
Make sure Littlefinger is clear
on the meaning of the word "immediately."

574
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:48,931
Shh.

575
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,643
Easy, friend.

576
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:17,963
She really is lovely.

577
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,809
I hope I can make her happy.

578
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,928
I hope so, too.

579
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,925
I've become quite fond of Lady Sansa
during our travels together.

580
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,241
She's suffered enough.

581
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:32,847
I'll never hurt her. You have my word.

582
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:37,049
I've heard very little about you,

583
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:41,049
which makes you quite a rare thing
as lords go.

584
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,765
I haven't been a lord very long.

585
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:46,365
I was a bastard.

586
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,044
And you're not anymore.

587
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,727
Allow me a moment alone with Lord Baelish.

588
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,040
Yes, Father.

589
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,804
And thank you, Lord Baelish.

590
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:57,244
I'm forever in your debt.

591
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,123
He seems pleased.

592
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,201
Shouldn't he be?

593
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,530
I assure you, she's still a virgin.

594
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:13,727
Tyrion never consummated the marriage. By
the law of the land, she is no man's wife.

595
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,040
Inspect her, if you must.

596
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:20,841
I'll leave that to the brothel keeper.
It's her name I need, not her virtue.

597
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:23,242
Then I have delivered
everything I promised.

598
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:27,007
And you're prepared for the consequences

599
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:29,651
when the Lannisters hear
I've wed Sansa Stark to Ramsay?

600
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:32,371
The Lannister name
doesn't mean what it once did.

601
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:33,930
Tywin is dead.

602
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,890
He kept his house in power
through sheer will.

603
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:40,282
Without him,
Jaime has one hand and no allies.

604
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:45,129
Tommen is a soft boy, not a king to fear.

605
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,565
The queen will be enraged.

606
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:48,603
Queen Margaery adores Sansa.

607
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,729
Cersei is Queen Mother,

608
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:54,491
a title whose importance
wanes with each passing day.

609
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,324
And yet she still has friends,

610
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,961
men in important places
whom she can ask for favors.

611
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:03,044
A message for you from Cersei Lannister.

612
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:07,167
A rider arrived from the Eyrie
shortly before dawn.

613
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:08,924
Apparently she thinks
you're still in the Vale.

614
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,842
A message for me, you say?

615
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,766
Strange that the seal is broken.

616
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:16,607
I'm sure you understand my position,
Lord Baelish.

617
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,722
If you receive word in the night
from the Queen Mother,

618
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:22,286
it does make me question our new alliance.

619
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,771
The Lannisters made you
one of the great lords of Westeros,

620
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:29,091
yet here you are in the North
undermining them.

621
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,170
Why gamble with your position?

622
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:35,008
Every ambitious move is a gamble.

623
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:38,611
You gambled when you drove a dagger
into Robb Stark's heart.

624
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,089
It appears that your gamble paid off.

625
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:44,885
You're Warden of the North.

626
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,962
I had Tywin Lannister's backing.

627
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,168
Who supports me now? You?

628
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,763
The Eyrie is mine.

629
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:56,723
The last time the lords of the Eyrie formed
an alliance with the lords of the North,

630
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:00,009
they brought down the greatest dynasty
this world has ever known.

631
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:05,322
I'd like to borrow one of your birds.

632
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:07,609
Cersei will expect a reply.

633
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:10,049
I'd like to read the reply.

634
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:34,729
I have to get out of this wheelhouse.

635
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,165
Volantis is a large city.

636
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:38,444
I have to get out of this wheelhouse.

637
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:42,525
The likelihood of you being spotted here
increases a hundredfold.

638
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,011
Mmm, I have to get out of this wheelhouse.

639
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:46,807
I'm not sure how many new ways
I can find of saying this.

640
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:56,324
I will not be of any use to Daenerys
Targaryen if I lose my mind.

641
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,722
I can't remember the last face I saw
that wasn't yours.

642
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:01,484
It's a perfectly good face.

643
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:03,245
I am losing my mind.

644
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:05,607
If anyone recognizes you,
you'll lose more than that.

645
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:09,002
Look, we are thousands of miles
from Westeros.

646
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:12,521
What am I?

647
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:15,688
One more drunk dwarf.

648
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:18,844
Whoa!

649
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:46,601
We have to go now.

650
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,842
Come on, hold it. Hold it.

651
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:50,046
Are you ready?

652
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:53,606
Slaves.

653
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:57,605
Yes, the Volantene masters
are very organized.

654
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:00,090
Flies for dung shovelers.

655
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:02,925
Hammers for builders.

656
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,048
Tears for whores.

657
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,924
Lest they forget.

658
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:17,682
Lord cast your light upon us.

659
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:21,800
For the night is dark and full of terrors.

660
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:24,082
We should keep moving.

661
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:33,283
I was once as you are now.

662
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,928
Bought and sold,

663
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,369
scourged and branded,

664
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:42,811
The only red priest we had in
King's Landing was Thoros of Myr.

665
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:43,881
This one's much better-looking.

666
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:46,008
The Lord of Light hears your voice.

667
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,884
He hears the king as he hears the slave;

668
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:52,282
he hears the Stone Men in their misery.

669
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:54,204
Stone men.

670
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:57,727
Good luck stopping
the spread of greyscale with prayer.

671
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,928
You'd have better luck
dancing away the plague.

672
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,570
He has sent you a savior!

673
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:06,170
From the fire she was reborn
to remake the world!

674
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,929
The Dragon Queen!

675
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,641
We're going to meet the savior.
You should have told me.

676
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:16,166
Who doesn't want to meet the savior?

677
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:32,401
Come on.

678
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:35,849
Let's find a brothel.

679
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,686
Build your house in a day.

680
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:59,403
It's good luck to rub a dwarf's head.

681
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:02,889
It's even better luck
to suck a dwarf's cock.

682
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:09,844
See? We blend right in.

683
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:13,242
Just two more travelers mad with lust.

684
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,685
Thank you.

685
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,368
What curious hair.

686
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:33,407
The Mother of Dragons!

687
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:40,208
It appears you're not
the only Targaryen supporter.

688
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:43,003
We were just heading east to see you.

689
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,809
I've got a dragon for you.

690
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,087
How much to make him spit fire?

691
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:55,003
Someone who inspires priests and whores
is worth taking seriously.

692
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:56,565
What makes you worth that much?

693
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:59,120
- I'm magic.
- I'll bet you bloody are.

694
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,606
Well, she's taken.

695
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:07,407
Where are you going?

696
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,922
I need to speak to someone with hair.

697
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:13,771
- Hello.
- Hello.

698
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:15,201
You've got no drink.

699
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,044
You've got no money.

700
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:19,202
Do I look like a man without money?

701
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,643
Never trust looks.

702
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:25,530
Until quite recently,
I was one of the richest men in the world.

703
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:30,804
But who needs wealth
when you can make a woman laugh?

704
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:34,969
I always pay my debts.

705
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:36,811
I'm well known for it.

706
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:43,165
You like her.

707
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:46,083
They all like her.

708
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:47,321
They all want to fuck a queen.

709
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,211
That's because they've never met a queen.

710
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,566
You're just saying that.

711
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,324
You know how to spot a liar.

712
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:55,726
If I could pick any girl here,

713
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,245
I would pick you.

714
00:56:58,320 --> 00:56:59,685
Why?

715
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:02,607
Because you have a skeptical mind.

716
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:10,601
All right, then. I'm warning you,
we're going to have to wash you first.

717
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:12,361
Come on.

718
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,329
I'm sorry, I can't.

719
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:27,160
Of course you can. You're shy.

720
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:29,725
I'm not.

721
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:32,446
Have another drink.

722
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:35,330
Gladly, but this, I can't do.

723
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:38,324
Believe me, no one is
more shocked than I am.

724
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,368
I hope it passes.

725
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:43,561
What will I do in my spare time?

726
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:49,251
Go for a piss. That's a start.

727
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:10,087
No need to worry. I was just...

728
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:11,241
Oh.

729
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:13,610
I thought you were someone else.

730
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:16,006
Shaw's almost over.

731
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:20,321
I'm sure there are girls inside
who'd be happy to oblige.

732
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:22,366
You've made some kind of mistake.

733
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:25,250
Why don't you tell me
what you think you're doing, and then...

734
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:29,088
I'm taking you to the queen.
