1
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:05,170
(Chanting)

2
00:00:24,624 --> 00:00:27,226
The 12th and final
locator spell

3
00:00:27,228 --> 00:00:29,194
has located nothing.

4
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:30,295
Duh!

5
00:00:30,297 --> 00:00:31,697
It couldn't
find a dragon

6
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:32,965
'cause
they're extinct.

7
00:00:32,967 --> 00:00:34,900
The only one left on
earth was shendu,

8
00:00:34,902 --> 00:00:36,268
and he's doing afterlife

9
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,903
in the inter-dimensional
slammer.

10
00:00:37,905 --> 00:00:40,806
Jade, we had to be
absolutely certain

11
00:00:40,808 --> 00:00:43,909
that the power of combustion
has not found a host.

12
00:00:43,911 --> 00:00:45,878
With no dragon
to inhabit,

13
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,713
the power
remains lost...

14
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:50,416
Safe from
the forces of darkness.

15
00:00:50,418 --> 00:00:54,586
As long as daolon wong
roams the earth,

16
00:00:54,588 --> 00:00:57,056
nothing remains safe.

17
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,063
Your answer,
most malevolent
of fire breathers?

18
00:01:04,065 --> 00:01:09,468
It would seem
you have summoned me
merely to humor me, wizard.

19
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:12,171
For to obtain the power
of combustion,

20
00:01:12,173 --> 00:01:16,608
you would require
- a living, earthbound dragon,

21
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,210
which I am not.

22
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:24,116
You underestimate
my talents, lord shendu.

23
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:27,252
As the most malevolent
of dark chi masters,

24
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:30,689
I know a multitude
of ancient spells,

25
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:33,058
some of which
might restore you.

26
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:35,761
Ah.

27
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:40,199
Then you may have my
rightful power, daolon wong,

28
00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:45,471
if you find the spell that
will allow me to live again.

29
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:46,031
Heads up!

30
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:52,004
Move it or lose it!

31
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:56,542
Uh, Jackie?

32
00:02:56,544 --> 00:02:58,243
Research, captain black.

33
00:02:58,245 --> 00:02:59,811
We have to be prepared.

34
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:02,781
With no more talisman-powered
animals on the loose--

35
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:05,918
it's only a matter of
time before daolon wong

36
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,853
comes after the ones
in the vault.

37
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:09,555
I'll beef up security
and--ow!

38
00:03:09,557 --> 00:03:11,623
Magic must defeat magic!

39
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:14,459
And the powers will be
difficult to safeguard

40
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:19,665
until they are
- transferred from the animals
into new talismans.

41
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:22,234
(Uncle chanting)

42
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:34,112
The first of the new talismans
has been empowered.

43
00:03:34,114 --> 00:03:36,281
All right!
Let's beta test--

44
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:43,989
oh. That was
my best one.

45
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:50,095
The making of a talisman
is very tricky business.

46
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:51,797
The spells
which created them

47
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:55,634
have been lost
for thousands of years.

48
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:59,671
Hey, Jackie,
when uncle gets the powers
out of these guys,

49
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:02,474
we still get
to keep 'em, right?

50
00:04:02,476 --> 00:04:05,210
Jade, the animals
have owners,

51
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:07,179
or natural habitats.

52
00:04:07,181 --> 00:04:09,147
don't you think
we should return them?

53
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:11,717
What? No, they're my pets!

54
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:13,585
Who has a pet ox?

55
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:16,588
Can we at least
keep scruffy? Please?

56
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,323
He belongs at section 13.

57
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:19,992
He's a natural-born
crime fighter,

58
00:04:19,994 --> 00:04:21,660
and he's already
housebroken, and--

59
00:04:21,662 --> 00:04:22,928
(growls and barks)

60
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,231
And he keeps
the neighbors awake
with his barking.

61
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:27,833
(Gasps) Jackie!

62
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,839
(Gasps) A dragon is near.

63
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:40,779
(Chanting)

64
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:47,953
Return to us, shendu.

65
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,055
Rise again!

66
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:09,174
Jackie: First it says
there isn't a dragon.
Now it says there is?

67
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:11,710
Are you sure the locator
is working properly?

68
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:14,279
Uncle wishes
that it were not,

69
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:16,348
but clearly,
it guides us.

70
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:29,494
If the locator
detects a dragon now,

71
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:32,664
someone must be
conjuring one.

72
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:36,501
Tch. And I'll
give you one guess
which someone that is.

73
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:39,538
Jade, this
is too dangerous.

74
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,039
We could be
facing a dragon.

75
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,441
Not just any dragon.

76
00:05:42,443 --> 00:05:44,576
(Gasps)
Aiyaa!
No.

77
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,746
Jackie: Shendu!

78
00:05:47,748 --> 00:05:48,980
Awaken!

79
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:50,048
(Chanting)

80
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,183
Uhh!

81
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:56,755
Gan! Ren! Chui! Zhen!

82
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,827
Hey!

83
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:03,428
Backyard barbecue.

84
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,896
What are
we grilling?

85
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:06,398
Jackie chan!

86
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,233
Let's tenderize him.

87
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:11,670
Volcano incinerates
field mouse!

88
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:26,251
Gotta stop this spell
before the barbecue
becomes a birthday party.

89
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:34,826
You are too late, child.

90
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:36,628
Urrr--

91
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,763
uhh!

92
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:41,500
Sorry.
Cannot hear you.

93
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:44,102
You must have a frog
in your throat.

94
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:45,437
(Ribbit)

95
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:46,505
Ptha!

96
00:06:46,507 --> 00:06:48,039
Cheap tricks.

97
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:52,844
(Chanting)

98
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:54,746
(Chanting)

99
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:07,726
Uhh!

100
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:15,033
Whoa! Hot--hot--
hot--hot--hot--hot!

101
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,173
Duh, Jade.

102
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:24,876
Hurricane kick!

103
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:26,578
Earthquake fist!

104
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,513
Asteroid belt!

105
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:30,549
Meteor pummels mountain!

106
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:34,553
Hot bath?

107
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:36,788
Cold shower.

108
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,025
(Chanting)

109
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:50,068
Uhh! Ah! Uhh!

110
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,303
Jackie!

111
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:53,004
(Daolon chanting)

112
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:07,586
Aaahhhhh!

113
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:13,925
Greetings, everyone.

114
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:24,169
It is great to be back.

115
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,238
Yo, shendude.

116
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,874
Uh, long time
no breathe.

117
00:08:28,876 --> 00:08:30,041
Yeah.

118
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,912
Chui: Happy, uh,
re-birthday. Ha ha.

119
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,153
Yes.

120
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:45,490
My prize approaches.

121
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:53,064
The power of
combustion--

122
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:56,101
belongs to me!

123
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:08,380
Mega bad day.

124
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:09,514
Ahh.

125
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:11,983
Feel the burn.

126
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,754
Aah!
- Aah!
Aah!

127
00:09:15,756 --> 00:09:17,722
But brother of darkness,

128
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,624
we had an arrangement.

129
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:22,260
I may be a noble dragon,

130
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:25,430
but I am also
a demon sorcerer

131
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:28,433
and not known
for keeping promises.

132
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:30,001
Aaaahhha.

133
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:31,937
Quickly!
I have a plan!

134
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:35,974
I still possess
2 talisman powers

135
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:38,510
with which
to destroy you.

136
00:09:38,512 --> 00:09:39,911
(Gasps)

137
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:43,181
Levitation!
Heat-beam eyes!

138
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:45,650
What thoughtful
birthday presents.

139
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:49,120
No!

140
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:51,523
Uhh!

141
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:54,859
And you will tell me where
to retrieve my other powers,

142
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:56,962
after I have
had the pleasure

143
00:09:56,964 --> 00:09:58,997
of quick-frying Jackie--

144
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:00,599
uhh...

145
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:04,269
Jade: Bolting for it?

146
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:06,204
That was your big plan?

147
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:09,608
Shendu will attempt
to reclaim what once
belonged to him.

148
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:12,577
The other talisman powers.

149
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:24,189
P.A.: Condition red.
Security lockdown initiated.

150
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:31,663
We're on full
tactical alert.

151
00:10:31,665 --> 00:10:32,998
I know,

152
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,633
magic must
defeat magic.

153
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:38,570
Which is why you must
buy uncle all the time
he requires.

154
00:10:38,572 --> 00:10:39,671
Tohru!

155
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:42,173
Jade!
Research!

156
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:45,076
You heard him, men.
Engage heavy artillery.

157
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:49,047
Radar operator: Sir,

158
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:52,183
we have a bogey approaching
from the perimeter.

159
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:53,918
A big one.

160
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,153
This is it.

161
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,722
If the demon breeches
the outer defenses,

162
00:10:57,724 --> 00:10:59,891
we make our stand here.

163
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:01,626
Protect that vault.

164
00:11:01,628 --> 00:11:03,061
(Explosion)

165
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,344
Captain black,

166
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:21,646
it may not be possible
to defend the vault.

167
00:11:21,648 --> 00:11:22,781
Aiyaa!

168
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:24,849
Cannot find spell
I'm looking for!

169
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:28,353
Uncle needs
more time!

170
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:31,356
I will buy uncle
as much time as I can.

171
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:32,490
Jackie?

172
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:33,892
(Rumbling)

173
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:38,963
Hold your positions.

174
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,467
Fire.

175
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,411
Someone say "fire?"

176
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:03,154
Ahh!

177
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:06,925
Surrender the animals, or--

178
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:08,493
you want them?

179
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:11,029
Come and get them.

180
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:13,565
(Roars)

181
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:20,805
Stop fooling!
Help uncle research!

182
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:22,674
Everyone,
grab a book.

183
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:35,520
Nice monkey.

184
00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:37,555
Please climb off
my head.

185
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:42,427
Power of levitation,
right.

186
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:44,662
Tch. Just be glad
he doesn't have
super-speed.

187
00:12:44,664 --> 00:12:45,897
Dwah! Jade!

188
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:47,031
Are you crazy?

189
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:49,567
If anything has ever
been too dangerous,

190
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:51,002
this is it!

191
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:53,138
Hey, where
my pooch goes, I go.

192
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,372
(Ruff)

193
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:57,909
Aah!

194
00:12:57,911 --> 00:12:59,177
I know
you are hungry,

195
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:01,212
but I need this
to drive.

196
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:05,316
Huh? Dah!

197
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:07,619
The astral projection
talisman.

198
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,593
Jackie!

199
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:17,662
Not a good time
for a nap!

200
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:23,868
Aahhhhh!

201
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,173
One cannot begin anew

202
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:30,441
without burning
a few Bridges.

203
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:38,216
Bwaaaaa!
- Bwaaaaa!

204
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:50,128
Shendu's hot on our tail.

205
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,830
We gotta jump it!

206
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,634
It won't go any faster!

207
00:13:56,636 --> 00:13:58,469
Hello? Rabbit power!

208
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:09,948
Too fast! Too fast!

209
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,653
Aah!
- Bwaa!

210
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:17,822
(Tires screech)

211
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:29,334
Everybody out!
Keep moving!

212
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:33,104
(Sighs)

213
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:35,940
At least we put
some distance
between us and--

214
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:38,243
aah!
- Bwaa!

215
00:14:38,245 --> 00:14:40,011
Both: Hurry, uncle.

216
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:41,512
Uncle: Hot cha!

217
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:43,581
You found a way
to take down shendu?

218
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,516
Shendu not important!

219
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:50,588
I found way to defeat
the person who knows
how to defeat shendu,

220
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:54,792
even though
that person does not
yet know he knows.

221
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,637
Jade!

222
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,272
Take the animals!

223
00:15:07,274 --> 00:15:08,406
Run!

224
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:09,941
Jade: Trying!

225
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,517
Jackie!

226
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:23,788
Eat heat beams!

227
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,323
(Oink)

228
00:15:25,325 --> 00:15:27,725
(Nervous laugh)
Sorry. Wrong pig.

229
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,194
Uhh!

230
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:31,329
Uhh!

231
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:36,234
Uhh!
Bad day! Bad day!
Bad day!

232
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:43,007
Hey, what do you get
when you cross an ox
with a rabbit?

233
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:45,276
A ram!

234
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:46,411
Uhh!

235
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:53,351
Go! Quick! Run!

236
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:13,705
(Ruff ruff ruff)

237
00:16:13,707 --> 00:16:15,073
Uhh!

238
00:16:15,075 --> 00:16:16,741
(Ruff ruff ruff)

239
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:21,379
(Gasps) Scruffy! No!

240
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:27,352
At last, it is time
to reabsorb my powers!

241
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:41,366
Daolon:
Gan! Ren! Chui! Zhen!

242
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:54,645
Prepare for battle!

243
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:56,748
Wow!
- We rock!

244
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,649
I'm feeling
prepared!

245
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:00,618
That thieving
lizard shendu

246
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:04,222
will pay dearly
for his betrayal.

247
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:06,324
(Uncle and tohru chanting)

248
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:10,228
Going somewhere?

249
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,496
Attack!

250
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:13,631
(Chanting)

251
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:18,403
All: Aah!

252
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:23,341
(Gasps)

253
00:17:23,343 --> 00:17:24,442
No!

254
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,677
We are weak.

255
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:28,846
We're human.

256
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:30,648
We're free.

257
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:31,916
Nah-uh.

258
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:34,385
Busted.

259
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:38,589
Uh--

260
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:39,690
phaa--

261
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:41,259
wh--(Whimpers)

262
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:45,029
Mr. wong,
you're under arrest.

263
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:47,231
You may be disenchanted,

264
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:51,769
but I believe
you still know many
ancient spells.

265
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:54,472
I will tell you
nothing!

266
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:59,243
Do you want to have
your revenge
upon shendu? Yes?

267
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:03,381
Then start talking
to uncle!

268
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:04,816
(Grumbling)

269
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:07,785
(Grunting)

270
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:14,692
And tiger makes 12.

271
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:18,863
Both: Whoa! Uuhh!

272
00:18:18,865 --> 00:18:21,365
Which means I now possess

273
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:25,002
so many ways
to make you suffer!

274
00:18:25,004 --> 00:18:26,704
(Crowd, chanting)

275
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:44,255
No! No, not again!

276
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,861
(Chanting)

277
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:54,465
Stop!

278
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:06,944
(Moans)

279
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:16,654
The extraction spell
is working!

280
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:17,989
The powers are gonna

281
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:19,423
go back into
the animals?

282
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:21,325
Wait and see.

283
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:22,894
Aarrrrgghhhhh!

284
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:32,336
(Cheering)

285
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:35,439
Uncle, was that--

286
00:19:35,441 --> 00:19:40,845
the very same spell
which turned shendu
to stone ages ago

287
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:43,648
and separated
his powers from him

288
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:46,951
in the form
of 12 talismans.

289
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:52,623
Courtesy
of daolon wong.

290
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,494
(Grumbling
under breath)

291
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,800
Hey, Jack--

292
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:04,936
um...Can we keep him?

293
00:20:04,938 --> 00:20:07,038
Who else'll
fetch my slippers?

294
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,539
Yes!

295
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,876
But he will have to
move out of the vault.

296
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:14,745
Need to make room
for some...New arrivals.

297
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,252
Shendu: Chaaaaan!

298
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:31,229
Hey, Jackie,
where do you like
to go in Hong Kong?

299
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:33,731
If my friend

300
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:36,734

I can take them...

301

302
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:42,740
Really see beautiful

00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,508
and also the mountain.

304
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:47,211
Hong Kong's a very,
very beautiful place.
