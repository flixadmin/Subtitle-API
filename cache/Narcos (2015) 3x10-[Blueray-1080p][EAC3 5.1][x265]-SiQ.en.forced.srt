1
00:01:06,029 --> 00:01:07,489
Hey, ladies.

2
00:01:08,282 --> 00:01:10,117
Are you looking for something?

3
00:01:10,701 --> 00:01:12,244
We're just taking a ride.

4
00:01:12,411 --> 00:01:13,495
Can't we pass?

5
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:15,998
No, sweetheart. You have to go back.

6
00:01:24,631 --> 00:01:25,507
Listen...

7
00:01:26,341 --> 00:01:28,343
Do you want to hang out later
back in town?

8
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:30,804
-What?
-I said--

9
00:02:37,371 --> 00:02:39,873
-Julio.
-Pacho, you motherfucker.

10
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,583
Motherfucking dog!

11
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,423
Let me go!

12
00:02:53,637 --> 00:02:56,306
Let go of me!

13
00:02:57,265 --> 00:02:58,725
-Let me go!
-Let's go.

14
00:02:58,892 --> 00:03:00,185
Let go--!

15
00:03:01,812 --> 00:03:02,896
You.

16
00:03:05,023 --> 00:03:06,566
Mrs. Salazar.

17
00:03:08,902 --> 00:03:11,113
Do you know what makes me happy, Pacho?

18
00:03:11,446 --> 00:03:12,906
Makes me very happy?

19
00:03:13,573 --> 00:03:17,411
That my sons didn't kill
your brother Alvaro.

20
00:03:17,994 --> 00:03:20,622
Because he's going to live
the rest of his life...

21
00:03:21,957 --> 00:03:24,710
as half a man. Half man, half--

22
00:03:51,403 --> 00:03:52,863
Help!

23
00:03:54,823 --> 00:03:56,199
Help!

24
00:06:22,888 --> 00:06:25,932
<i>...the great event of the surrender
of Helmer Herrera,</i>

25
00:06:26,099 --> 00:06:28,059
<i>to Colombian justice.</i>

26
00:06:28,685 --> 00:06:31,688
<i>And this incident marked the end
of the Cali cartel...</i>

27
00:06:34,566 --> 00:06:38,361
<i>who were responsible,
according to international sources,</i>

28
00:06:38,528 --> 00:06:41,531
<i>for more than 80%
of the cocaine trafficking in the world.</i>

29
00:06:45,744 --> 00:06:48,830
<i>Throughout my campaign and presidency,</i>

30
00:06:48,997 --> 00:06:52,000
<i>I committed to dismantling
all narco-trafficking networks,</i>

31
00:06:55,587 --> 00:06:57,339
<i>and we're doing it.</i>

32
00:07:36,836 --> 00:07:39,673
Gilberto. How've you been?

33
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:41,007
Good, brother.

34
00:07:41,174 --> 00:07:43,593
Grateful that we're all together.

35
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:47,180
The investment we made in our friends
can bear fruit.

36
00:07:47,347 --> 00:07:48,932
And then all this will pass away

37
00:07:49,099 --> 00:07:51,893
like some old joke
you can't quite remember.

38
00:07:52,394 --> 00:07:54,980
For this, gentlemen, I propose a toast.

39
00:07:55,146 --> 00:07:56,773
Of course you would.

40
00:07:57,357 --> 00:07:58,483
Fucking Chepe.

41
00:07:59,234 --> 00:08:02,070
Gilberto, I'd like to say a few words.

42
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:06,032
You all know this wasn't what I wanted.

43
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:09,202
So it's very hard for me to admit
that I know this is for the best.

44
00:08:12,122 --> 00:08:15,250
And thanks to you, we're on the verge of,
how do you call it?

45
00:08:15,417 --> 00:08:17,377
"A great victory."

46
00:08:21,047 --> 00:08:22,590
We believe in you.

47
00:08:23,883 --> 00:08:26,970
To my brother, Gilberto. Our leader.

48
00:08:27,137 --> 00:08:29,431
Gentlemen of Cali... <i>Salud!</i>

49
00:09:07,177 --> 00:09:08,094
Hello.

50
00:10:38,101 --> 00:10:39,310
Go ahead, sir.

51
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,604
Director.

52
00:10:42,438 --> 00:10:43,314
Don Miguel.

53
00:10:44,315 --> 00:10:45,567
Please, go ahead.

54
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,164
-Hello.
<i>-It's</i> me.

55
00:10:59,706 --> 00:11:02,375
-Where are we on Pallomari?
-We put <i>Navegante</i> on it, <i>Dad.</i>

56
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,460
I'll find him, don't worry about it.

57
00:11:04,627 --> 00:11:06,754
And fucking Salcedo too, you'll see.

58
00:11:06,921 --> 00:11:09,382
David, don't take your eye off Henao.

59
00:11:10,216 --> 00:11:13,219
That motherfucker might see this
as an opportunity. Keep a low profile.

60
00:11:16,681 --> 00:11:18,016
Sure, don't worry.

61
00:11:20,643 --> 00:11:23,271
-How's Maria?
<i>-/ really don't know.</i>

62
00:11:23,438 --> 00:11:26,733
<i>How come you don't know?
Make sure she's taken care of.</i>

63
00:11:27,358 --> 00:11:29,402
It's very important you handle Pallomari.

64
00:11:29,569 --> 00:11:32,030
That motherfucker could ruin everything.

65
00:11:32,739 --> 00:11:34,574
Call me when it's done.

66
00:11:51,674 --> 00:11:54,093
-Guillermo?
-I need your help, Gonzalo.

67
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,638
You know I can't get involved.

68
00:11:56,804 --> 00:11:59,432
Nothing is going to happen to you.
When has anything ever happened to you?

69
00:12:00,183 --> 00:12:02,435
I'm asking you for legal advice,
and quickly.

70
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:07,440
I've decided that the best way
to get out of this situation

71
00:12:07,607 --> 00:12:09,651
is to turn myself in to the authorities.

72
00:12:09,817 --> 00:12:11,736
Yes, normally that would be the case. Yes.

73
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:15,073
But the problem is you already
have a warrant out for your arrest.

74
00:12:16,032 --> 00:12:16,991
An arrest warrant?

75
00:12:17,158 --> 00:12:20,203
The police won't protect you.
In fact, they'll probably kill you.

76
00:12:20,954 --> 00:12:22,747
I'm the head accountant.

77
00:12:23,373 --> 00:12:25,583
And every dollar in this organization,
and every secret,

78
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,627
has been through this head.
It's all in here.

79
00:12:27,794 --> 00:12:29,712
So tell whoever needs to know
that I'm willing to negotiate.

80
00:12:31,589 --> 00:12:34,759
Guillermo, my advice to you
is to get your family and leave Cali.

81
00:12:35,343 --> 00:12:37,512
My wife's very attached to her work.

82
00:12:37,929 --> 00:12:41,349
-What? I don't understand.
-You know her, she's stubborn.

83
00:12:42,308 --> 00:12:45,311
She built her business from the ground up.

84
00:12:49,857 --> 00:12:51,484
I can't leave without her.

85
00:12:52,318 --> 00:12:55,321
Look, Guillermo... this is not
my legal advice, but as your friend...

86
00:12:57,532 --> 00:13:00,535
talk some sense into your wife.
Immediately.

87
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:08,501
Can you get me a gun?

88
00:13:12,213 --> 00:13:14,340
We'll have to look out for ourselves
for the rest of our lives,

89
00:13:14,507 --> 00:13:16,634
but if I help them...

90
00:13:17,218 --> 00:13:19,095
maybe one day
we can come back to Colombia.

91
00:13:19,262 --> 00:13:21,931
Are you insane? They almost killed us.

92
00:13:23,016 --> 00:13:26,311
They almost killed us, and now you're
telling me you want to go back? To Cali?

93
00:13:26,936 --> 00:13:29,314
Do you really think
we can come back to Colombia?

94
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,942
The moment we come back to Colombia,
they'll kill our daughters.

95
00:13:33,985 --> 00:13:37,613
Are you doing this to make up
for the last four years of your life?

96
00:13:42,827 --> 00:13:44,203
I'm a good man.

97
00:13:50,084 --> 00:13:51,002
I was a good man.

98
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:54,047
I'll leave with the girls tomorrow.

99
00:13:54,505 --> 00:13:56,090
I'm not waiting for you.

100
00:14:08,561 --> 00:14:10,938
Wait for me, okay? Thanks.

101
00:14:25,203 --> 00:14:26,287
That way.

102
00:14:33,211 --> 00:14:37,048
Keep looking for him.
No more fucking excuses.

103
00:14:38,466 --> 00:14:39,467
Okay.

104
00:14:46,682 --> 00:14:47,850
Yeah?

105
00:14:49,894 --> 00:14:51,187
Have you heard from your father?

106
00:14:53,689 --> 00:14:54,607
Yes.

107
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,823
David, I've been wondering about
the arrangement I had for my son and--

108
00:15:03,032 --> 00:15:04,075
Arrangement?

109
00:15:06,077 --> 00:15:07,745
I thought it was true love.

110
00:15:10,331 --> 00:15:11,833
Your father knows I care about him.

111
00:15:16,045 --> 00:15:17,255
That's beautiful.

112
00:15:17,547 --> 00:15:18,589
Seriously.

113
00:15:19,173 --> 00:15:20,633
But here's the thing...

114
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,803
You don't mean anything to me.

115
00:15:24,929 --> 00:15:26,305
You're not my mother.

116
00:15:27,473 --> 00:15:28,975
You're not my fucking problem.

117
00:15:30,184 --> 00:15:31,561
-David--
-What?

118
00:15:32,437 --> 00:15:34,105
What the fuck do I owe you?

119
00:15:41,446 --> 00:15:45,199
Open your legs for someone else.
You're good at that.

120
00:15:48,077 --> 00:15:49,078
Okay?

121
00:17:41,899 --> 00:17:43,276
Good afternoon, Mr. Salcedo.

122
00:17:43,442 --> 00:17:47,280
Mr. Espinosa's still at lunch.
He should be back soon.

123
00:17:47,446 --> 00:17:49,282
-We'll wait for him inside.
-Okay, sir.

124
00:17:52,243 --> 00:17:53,452
Another drink?

125
00:17:56,455 --> 00:17:58,833
I need to go. See you next week.

126
00:18:10,219 --> 00:18:11,095
Excuse me.

127
00:18:11,554 --> 00:18:12,930
How are the girls here?

128
00:18:13,097 --> 00:18:14,640
The best of Cali.

129
00:18:16,267 --> 00:18:17,101
Open it!

130
00:18:19,854 --> 00:18:20,771
Get in.

131
00:18:22,565 --> 00:18:23,983
Get in, motherfucker!

132
00:18:35,703 --> 00:18:38,122
ACCESS RESTRICTED
PASSWORD REQUIRED

133
00:18:42,668 --> 00:18:44,378
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.

134
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:46,922
-I'm looking for Fredy Moya.
-Yes.

135
00:18:47,465 --> 00:18:49,675
-The one wearing purple.
-Thanks.

136
00:18:55,765 --> 00:18:58,893
Excuse me.
You work with Patricia Pallomari?

137
00:19:01,312 --> 00:19:02,980
Javier Peña, DEA.

138
00:19:04,607 --> 00:19:05,775
I'll call you back.

139
00:20:05,835 --> 00:20:07,837
<i>-Hello.</i>
-It's <i>me.</i>

140
00:20:09,046 --> 00:20:11,298
Baby, I can't talk right now.
Call me back later.

141
00:20:11,465 --> 00:20:14,260
<i>No. Wait, I can't call you back. Wait.</i>

142
00:20:14,427 --> 00:20:15,344
Yes.

143
00:20:16,637 --> 00:20:19,640
Yes, I'd have to check my records
in the office.

144
00:20:22,017 --> 00:20:23,644
I can't talk.

145
00:20:24,186 --> 00:20:26,647
<i>-Wait.
-Patricia, the DEA was just here.</i>

146
00:20:27,231 --> 00:20:29,859
The DEA. Asking questions.

147
00:20:30,025 --> 00:20:32,361
<i>-What did you tell them?
-To go fuck themselves.</i>

148
00:20:32,528 --> 00:20:34,071
<i>They want Guillermo, not you.</i>

149
00:20:34,238 --> 00:20:36,157
<i>I can't talk now. We'll discuss it later.</i>

150
00:20:37,158 --> 00:20:39,034
<i>Patricia, they talked about a reward.</i>

151
00:20:48,544 --> 00:20:49,879
We need to take advantage.

152
00:20:52,173 --> 00:20:53,591
I need to use the bathroom.

153
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:12,526
Work again?

154
00:21:12,693 --> 00:21:13,611
Yes.

155
00:21:13,861 --> 00:21:15,070
Excuse me.

156
00:21:15,404 --> 00:21:16,405
Excuse me.

157
00:21:17,198 --> 00:21:18,824
Open the window this time.

158
00:21:42,556 --> 00:21:43,557
This way.

159
00:21:57,071 --> 00:22:00,074
I'd offer a drink,
but I don't pour liquor for Cali whores.

160
00:22:07,832 --> 00:22:09,458
Have a seat.

161
00:22:16,674 --> 00:22:20,177
Don Orlando,
I'm here to ask for your protection.

162
00:22:21,762 --> 00:22:23,013
Why?

163
00:22:23,889 --> 00:22:25,474
You don't feel safe?

164
00:22:30,479 --> 00:22:32,982
I did what I had to after my husband died.

165
00:22:33,983 --> 00:22:36,986
Now I'm in your home...
ready to do what I have to again.

166
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,203
So what is it you're offering me?

167
00:22:55,421 --> 00:22:56,297
In here.

168
00:22:56,964 --> 00:22:58,048
How was the drive?

169
00:22:58,465 --> 00:22:59,383
It was easy.

170
00:23:00,885 --> 00:23:02,052
Nice place.

171
00:23:14,815 --> 00:23:16,942
Let me start by thanking you
for the meeting.

172
00:23:17,109 --> 00:23:20,237
We're both busy men.
I won't waste your time.

173
00:23:20,779 --> 00:23:23,574
But I'm a business man, like you.

174
00:23:24,325 --> 00:23:27,328
The information you seek
maybe is in my possession.

175
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:35,669
If we come to an arrangement,
my information becomes yours.

176
00:23:35,961 --> 00:23:37,046
You feel me?

177
00:23:39,965 --> 00:23:43,510
On the phone,
you told me you know where Pallomari is.

178
00:23:44,303 --> 00:23:45,137
Correct?

179
00:23:47,932 --> 00:23:50,059
Look, let me put it this way...

180
00:23:52,686 --> 00:23:53,938
Patricia and I are in love.

181
00:23:55,189 --> 00:23:56,190
We want to be together.

182
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:02,446
So Guillermo's a problem for me.

183
00:24:04,156 --> 00:24:07,159
From what I've heard,
he's a problem for you too. Am I right?

184
00:24:10,788 --> 00:24:12,081
You are correct.

185
00:24:17,086 --> 00:24:19,338
So maybe we can help each other.

186
00:24:19,755 --> 00:24:22,675
If we come to an arrangement,
my information becomes yours.

187
00:24:34,853 --> 00:24:38,023
-Let me fix you a drink. Okay?
-Sure.

188
00:24:39,692 --> 00:24:42,611
By the way...
are you guys running Windows 95 yet?

189
00:24:42,903 --> 00:24:44,780
Think we're going to wait for next year.

190
00:24:46,615 --> 00:24:48,951
Where the fuck is Pallomari, you faggot?

191
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,245
Did you hear me?

192
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:08,053
Here's the milk.
Just a few minutes and then you go to bed.

193
00:25:13,809 --> 00:25:16,979
-Get in your room.
-Who is it?

194
00:25:17,146 --> 00:25:18,981
I don't know. Get in your room. Quickly.

195
00:25:28,407 --> 00:25:29,908
-It's okay.
-They're the gringos.

196
00:25:30,075 --> 00:25:31,660
-Calm down.
-Do you know them?

197
00:25:31,827 --> 00:25:33,829
-They came to my office.
-Put the gun down.

198
00:25:33,996 --> 00:25:34,788
Close the door.

199
00:25:37,833 --> 00:25:39,168
Close the door.

200
00:27:38,829 --> 00:27:41,582
No, Guillermo.
We can't leave for at least a week.

201
00:27:41,748 --> 00:27:44,793
-You heard them.
-The company. I can't just leave.

202
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,587
-We must go.
-I need at least a week.

203
00:27:54,261 --> 00:27:57,264
Put the radio on the dash...
and your hands on the wheel.

204
00:28:18,619 --> 00:28:20,454
How are you, Jorge Salcedo?

205
00:28:37,262 --> 00:28:40,474
I know about Fredy Moya.
It's none of my business.

206
00:28:40,641 --> 00:28:41,975
You're right. It's not your problem.

207
00:28:42,142 --> 00:28:44,269
You realize what happens if they find you?

208
00:28:45,812 --> 00:28:47,105
And your kids?

209
00:28:52,861 --> 00:28:54,238
I have to say goodbye to him.

210
00:28:54,404 --> 00:28:57,074
We're in love. I can't leave like that.

211
00:28:57,241 --> 00:29:00,244
Mrs. Pallomari, if you stay, you die.

212
00:29:01,703 --> 00:29:02,663
Understood?

213
00:29:03,914 --> 00:29:05,707
I'll be honest with you.

214
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:07,793
The truth is...

215
00:29:08,794 --> 00:29:12,714
I was very disappointed to hear
you were the fucking rat.

216
00:29:16,301 --> 00:29:18,011
But I still like you.

217
00:29:20,514 --> 00:29:23,517
It's all good. I'm not going to kill you.

218
00:29:27,229 --> 00:29:28,814
David Rodriguez...

219
00:29:30,857 --> 00:29:32,943
he wants to do it himself personally,
you know?

220
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,780
That's fine by me.

221
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,660
That way,
our friendship will remain intact.

222
00:29:55,048 --> 00:29:56,133
-Let's go.
-Come on, damn it!

223
00:29:57,217 --> 00:29:59,886
-The jacket...
-Okay, that's it. Let's go.

224
00:30:30,751 --> 00:30:32,502
Tell them to come out.

225
00:30:40,969 --> 00:30:43,555
Tell them to come out, Jorge Salcedo.

226
00:31:12,376 --> 00:31:13,877
Let's finish this.

227
00:31:19,508 --> 00:31:20,842
Put the gun down.

228
00:31:23,595 --> 00:31:24,971
I don't want to kill you.

229
00:31:28,767 --> 00:31:30,769
We both know that's a lie.

230
00:31:37,943 --> 00:31:39,111
The children!

231
00:32:03,051 --> 00:32:06,805
Don't look!

232
00:32:09,141 --> 00:32:10,058
Don't look!

233
00:32:11,268 --> 00:32:12,811
What the fuck is he doing here?

234
00:32:15,021 --> 00:32:17,566
-What the hell?
-Open!

235
00:32:19,109 --> 00:32:19,985
Be careful!

236
00:32:20,527 --> 00:32:21,653
We're in.

237
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,280
Move!

238
00:32:36,543 --> 00:32:37,752
What happened?

239
00:32:39,796 --> 00:32:41,339
They killed Navegante.

240
00:32:43,633 --> 00:32:44,843
And Pallomari?

241
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:46,970
The motherfucker's gone.

242
00:32:48,054 --> 00:32:49,097
You sure?

243
00:32:53,935 --> 00:32:56,605
We're going to the airport.
We're going to catch those...

244
00:32:56,771 --> 00:32:58,440
We're leaving, now!

245
00:32:58,607 --> 00:32:59,816
Motherfuckers!

246
00:33:04,571 --> 00:33:06,406
You, come with me.

247
00:33:08,116 --> 00:33:11,703
We're going to the airport. Take the guys.
Now, now, now!

248
00:33:19,794 --> 00:33:22,005
That's the North Valley, fuckers.

249
00:33:22,172 --> 00:33:24,174
Who do they think they're messing with?

250
00:33:24,591 --> 00:33:26,718
You just got smoked, bitches.

251
00:33:34,601 --> 00:33:35,519
Boss!

252
00:33:37,312 --> 00:33:38,313
Boss!

253
00:33:52,869 --> 00:33:54,871
Let's go. Out.

254
00:33:59,584 --> 00:34:03,255
Patricia, get out this way.
Careful, my love.

255
00:34:13,765 --> 00:34:15,976
Do you see that? We have a private plane.

256
00:34:16,184 --> 00:34:18,436
We have a plane just for us.

257
00:34:42,127 --> 00:34:44,921
Get on the plane. Go.
Everything is going to be fine.

258
00:34:45,088 --> 00:34:46,923
Come on. Let's go.

259
00:34:52,554 --> 00:34:53,847
Goodbye, Salcedo.

260
00:36:07,462 --> 00:36:10,715
<i>And we have total agreement
in that these testimonies</i>

261
00:36:10,882 --> 00:36:13,885
<i>that we have heard from Mr. Pallomari
are ridiculous and grotesquely false.</i>

262
00:36:16,513 --> 00:36:17,597
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

263
00:39:19,821 --> 00:39:23,408
You know what it means
if you go on the record, right?

264
00:39:24,576 --> 00:39:25,869
There'll be a price to pay.

265
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:30,498
Press the button.

266
00:39:34,836 --> 00:39:37,255
Let's start with your name and occupation.

267
00:39:42,385 --> 00:39:45,388
Javier Peña,
DEA attaché in Colombia.

268
00:40:16,794 --> 00:40:18,421
<i>An exclusive interview
with this news channel.</i>

269
00:40:18,588 --> 00:40:21,883
<i>He accuses the country
of being a Marco-Democracy.</i>

270
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:24,052
<i>He said the country has fallen
into the abyss.</i>

271
00:40:24,218 --> 00:40:27,722
<i>His words have not been well received
by the Colombian people.</i>

272
00:40:28,264 --> 00:40:31,684
<i>The public is demanding
an official response from--</i>

273
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:51,973
<i>Recordings that link the president
with narco-trafficking have been leaked.</i>

274
00:41:53,474 --> 00:41:55,435
<i>The reality is that
they need five million.</i>

275
00:41:55,601 --> 00:41:57,979
<i>-Uh-huh.
-We're missing three, see?</i>

276
00:41:58,146 --> 00:41:59,814
<i>-We have it.
-Yes?</i>

277
00:41:59,981 --> 00:42:01,315
<i>Yes, that's done.</i>

278
00:42:01,482 --> 00:42:04,527
<i>This scandal threatens elected president
Ernesto Samper's career</i>

279
00:42:04,694 --> 00:42:08,364
<i>if the authorities confirm his campaign
was funded by narco-trafficking money.</i>

280
00:42:08,531 --> 00:42:12,285
<i>President Samper,
the only solution is your resignation!</i>

281
00:42:12,827 --> 00:42:16,414
<i>Colombians can be certain...</i>

282
00:42:19,834 --> 00:42:22,837
<i>that if they prove any money transfer
of any kind,</i>

283
00:42:26,007 --> 00:42:29,010
<i>the deposit would've been made
behind my back.</i>

284
00:43:15,807 --> 00:43:16,891
Don Chepe.

285
00:43:18,851 --> 00:43:20,770
I was happy to get your call.

286
00:46:58,362 --> 00:47:01,198
All right, fellas. Let's move. Keep going.

287
00:47:03,451 --> 00:47:04,577
Keep going.

288
00:47:55,086 --> 00:47:56,128
Stubborn.

289
00:48:04,595 --> 00:48:05,679
So...

290
00:48:06,597 --> 00:48:09,600
do you have to fix the fence
every time a storm hits?

291
00:48:11,102 --> 00:48:13,104
Someone has to do it.

292
00:48:13,771 --> 00:48:15,398
That's how life works.
