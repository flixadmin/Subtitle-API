1
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:35,160
They're here, out front.

2
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:37,496
- How many?
- Nelson Brey, three others.

3
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:39,039
- His toothbrush?
- Got it.

4
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:40,415
What about your stuff?

5
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:43,710
Oh, we'll talk to them
about stopping at your place.

6
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,963
Skyler. Skyler.

7
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:47,339
- What?
- I'm not going.

8
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:51,050
- What?
- I'm not going to Hank and Marie's.

9
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:54,012
- We're in danger.
- Yes, that's true. Because of me.

10
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,764
It doesn't matter.

11
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:58,350
All that matters
is the rest of you are safe.

12
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:01,353
And that's why I'm not going with you.

13
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:02,688
I'm the real target.

14
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:05,941
- But we'll all be safer at Hank's.
- No, no, no.

15
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:08,777
No one will be safe at Hank's
if I'm there.

16
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:11,572
Walt, it's the DEA.

17
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,991
Skyler, you don't know these people.

18
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:15,576
- I...
- No. Skyler, please.

19
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,245
Trust me. This is how it has to be.

20
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:21,748
Those agents outside.
They're not gonna just leave you here.

21
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,500
It's protective custody.

22
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:27,462
All they know is that Hank
is the only person that's in danger.

23
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:31,049
They're including us as a courtesy
to Marie, to keep her happy.

24
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:36,388
How am I supposed to explain that
to Marie or Junior? Or Hank?

25
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:38,056
I don't know.

26
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:40,434
But you'll do it. You'll figure it out.

27
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,605
Hank knows that Marie
will be overreacting.

28
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,733
Except she's not.

29
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:53,905
I'll talk to Hank. You just back me up
with everyone else.

30
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:58,535
You really expect me to say,
"Okay, Walt, sure. Just stay here and"...

31
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:00,704
No.

32
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:02,748
There's gotta be another way.

33
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:05,042
There isn't.

34
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:07,753
There was.

35
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:10,297
But now there isn't.

36
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:14,635
Walt

37
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:17,137
how long till you're safe?

38
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:19,806
Till you can work this out?

39
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,978
Oh, Skyler.

40
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:26,772
No.

41
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:28,732
- Skyler.
- No.

42
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:33,070
I have lived under the threat of death
for a year now.

43
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:37,783
And because of that, I've made choices.

44
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,910
- I...
- Listen to me.

45
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:45,582
I alone should suffer the consequences
of those choices, no one else.

46
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,043
And those consequences

47
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,421
they're coming.

48
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:57,886
No more prolonging the inevitable.

49
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,314
Feed that belt through
those seatbelt holders.

50
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:11,650
Hank, I've got a car wash to run.

51
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:16,279
I mean, you don't honestly believe
that I'm in danger, do you? Me?

52
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:21,076
Oh, Jesus, it's gonna go over like a lead
balloon. It'll be Marie that kills me.

53
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:24,413
Well, just know that I'll get there
as soon as I can.

54
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:28,083
And let Steve Gomez know.
I told his guys.

55
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,209
And just stay safe.

56
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:33,171
Oh, please.
Whole thing's just a giant jerk-off.

57
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:37,634
Yeah, yeah. But keep your head down
anyway, all right?

58
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:39,386
<i>All right.</i>

59
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,930
All right, buddy. Take care.

60
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,483
I know.

61
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,216
Okay, sweetie.

62
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:22,012
Okay, my love. Okay. Okay.

63
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,142
Okay, my darling. It's okay.

64
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:29,227
We're all right.

65
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,313
Okay.

66
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:57,667
{\an8}He's gonna risk his life
over a stupid car wash?

67
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,587
{\an8}Does he understand
what's going on with Uncle Hank?

68
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,464
He'll come when he's able.

69
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:04,799
That's pathetic. I...

70
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,677
How hard did you even try or did you?

71
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:11,222
- Hey, hey, hey. Lay off your mom.
- Well, you know, Hank

72
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:15,852
{\an8}we wouldn't be arguing about this if
you and Steve would make him come.

73
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:17,937
{\an8}Why didn't your people
put him in the car?

74
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:21,232
{\an8}- It's not Nazi Germany, all right?
- Oh, you... Nazi Germany.

75
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:25,195
{\an8}If I had a dollar for every time
I heard that. I'm gonna call him.

76
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:29,532
{\an8}He's gonna get his behind
here immediately. End of story.

77
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,077
{\an8}Thank you.
At least somebody is listening.

78
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:35,830
{\an8}- Because we are all in danger here.
- We're not all in danger here.

79
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:39,960
{\an8}Will you stop saying that?
That is asking for trouble.

80
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,170
Come on, Walt.

81
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,927
{\an8}He's not picking up.

82
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:52,347
{\an8}Look, could we just take this down
a notch, okay? Everybody?

83
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:54,975
{\an8}You guys can stay here
as long as you like.

84
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,393
{\an8}We got plenty of room.

85
00:07:56,559 --> 00:08:01,189
{\an8}I wouldn't worry about any danger
to Walt or any of us, okay?

86
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:03,858
This whole thing
is just a damn smoke screen.

87
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:08,071
- How do you mean "a smoke screen"?
- An anonymous threat against me?

88
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:10,865
{\an8}I'm stuck in a wheelchair,
I'm not even on the job.

89
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:14,953
{\an8}No, someone didn't like the way
I've been spending my free time.

90
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,038
What? Minerals?

91
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:23,003
{\an8}Timing seem a bit odd to you, huh?

92
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,838
{\an8}I start looking...

93
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:30,092
{\an8}into Fring, all of a sudden
I'm on lockdown for my protection?

94
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,970
{\an8}- Gus Fring?
- Did you say...?

95
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:34,180
{\an8}- What...?
- From the chicken restaurant?

96
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,599
{\an8}Hank, what are you talking about?

97
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,478
{\an8}Just one man's humble opinion,
that's all.

98
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,856
I think Los Pollos Hermanos is a front,

99
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:46,109
for the biggest meth distributor
in the Southwest.

100
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:49,821
{\an8}- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Steve, are you even looking into this?

101
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:53,658
{\an8}We're looking into everything.
But we work on fact, not conjecture.

102
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:58,496
{\an8}And the fact is that the scumbags
that hit you first were Mexican cartel

103
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:01,291
{\an8}not some German multinational whatever.

104
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,168
Definitely not Colonel Sanders.

105
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:05,503
Now, if we even had a shred of proof...

106
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,922
Isn't that what you get paid to go get?

107
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:13,011
{\an8}Remember that laundry
I told you about? I'd start there.

108
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:14,345
- Come on, man.
- Jesus.

109
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:16,514
It's a perfect spot for a meth superlab.

110
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,099
Oh, my God.

111
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,559
Hey

112
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:22,479
what if I'm right?

113
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:25,440
Even if you were right... And you ain't.

114
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:28,777
...there's no way a judge
is gonna give me a warrant.

115
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:32,447
Warrant? What happened
to good old-fashioned knock and talk?

116
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:34,157
Oh, that's right.

117
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:35,408
I forgot.

118
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,453
You were never very good at those,
were you?

119
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,402
- Can I help you?
- Yes, sir.

120
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:14,155
We wondered
if we could take a look around.

121
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,406
Why?

122
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,534
- Sorry, what's your name?
- Dennis.

123
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,746
Dennis. Hey. I'm Steve Gomez.
I'm with the DEA. Drug Enforcement.

124
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:23,123
Is there a problem?

125
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,624
For you? No. No problem.

126
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,752
We were just wondering
if we could take a look around.

127
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,839
Can I tell you a story?

128
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,715
- Yeah.
- I bust this chef.

129
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,300
Well, he says he's a chef.

130
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:38,012
Because you work at a restaurant
that charges $14 for a burger

131
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:41,432
that don't make you a chef.
Makes you a burger-flipper.

132
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,101
- Least in my book.
- Yeah.

133
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:46,437
Anyway, so we bust this chef,
heroin possession.

134
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:49,482
He says, "Just because
you found heroin in my chef whites"

135
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,109
doesn't make it mine.

136
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:55,155
"Maybe it came from the place that
launders my chef whites." This place.

137
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,533
- We don't do that stuff over here.
- I know, I know.

138
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,326
I'll say it for you.

139
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,329
His story is a big load
of steaming horse shit.

140
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:06,916
We're gonna find heroin here
like we're gonna find Jimmy Hoffa.

141
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,334
Right?

142
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:13,298
The thing is that this chef's daddy
is a United States senator.

143
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:16,384
I'm not gonna tell which one,
but you know who he is.

144
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:21,097
So now I gotta waste my time
checking out this burger-flipper's story.

145
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:23,641
If I don't, his old man's gonna jam me up

146
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,186
my ASAC, my whole entire office.

147
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,062
Politics, huh?

148
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,439
So, what do you think?

149
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:31,858
Listen, I have to check on my boss.

150
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:35,403
He's out of town. I can't promise
I'll reach him anytime soon.

151
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,822
Well, yeah.
That's probably the way to go.

152
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:40,992
I'll have to go get a warrant
and we'll do it official.

153
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:43,119
You have to close down for the day.

154
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:46,414
- What...? Why?
- Twenty agents poking around?

155
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:48,750
It'd be less trouble if it was just us.

156
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:51,878
But your call.

157
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:59,093
Just the two of you?
You make it quick, right?

158
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,930
Dennis, we'll be like the wind.

159
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:05,433
- Okay.
- Could you tell him?

160
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,436
- Okay.
- Okay.

161
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:19,197
Can you clear out
some of your people for us?

162
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:21,783
Confuses the dog's nose.

163
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:32,020
So

164
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:35,148
How long we gotta be quiet down here?

165
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,904
And what happens after this?

166
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:45,491
Provided they don't find their way
in here and bust our asses?

167
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:50,288
I gotta be, like, snuck down here in a
laundry hamper for the rest of eternity?

168
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:53,041
Now, I'm going on record.

169
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:55,834
This blows.

170
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,549
Hello.

171
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:07,597
For you.

172
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,190
Yeah?

173
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:19,942
<i>Do you know what's happening upstairs?</i>

174
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,236
I have a pretty good idea.

175
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:25,406
This is all the result
of your former partner.

176
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,368
Do you understand now?

177
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,829
<i>Do you see why this can't continue?</i>

178
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,500
I get it.
The guy is a complete and total dick.

179
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,877
But I can't.

180
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,256
I'm not signing off.

181
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:44,425
<i>Okay?</i>

182
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,512
Like I said

183
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:54,560
if something final happens
to Mr. White

184
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,064
we're going to have a problem.

185
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,904
<i>So, what are you gonna do?</i>

186
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,868
There will be an appropriate response.

187
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,870
<i>Appropriate? What does that mean?</i>

188
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,580
Hello?

189
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:54,453
They're gone.

190
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,248
We're good.

191
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:11,697
<i>You have reached Walter White.</i>

192
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:15,159
<i>Please state your name, number
and the reason for your call.</i>

193
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:16,702
<i>Thank you.</i>

194
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,769
<i>You have six new messages.</i>

195
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:44,939
<i>Hey, kid. It's me, Goodman.
Give me a call, would you?</i>

196
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:51,862
<i>Hey, need to hear from you.
Hope I made myself clear about that.</i>

197
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,699
<i>Call me as soon as you can.</i>

198
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,744
<i>Pinkman, get over here. Stat, pronto.</i>

199
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:02,748
<i>Don't call, just get over here.
Would you just, please?</i>

200
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,292
<i>I don't know
if I'm speaking English here...</i>

201
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:12,174
- What's up? He's waiting for me.
- Hold up. Hold up.

202
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:13,634
What the hell, man?

203
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:17,471
Get off of me. Hey, Goodman.
Get out here.

204
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:20,766
- Hey. Yo, get your goon off me.
- Not him, moron. Drop.

205
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:24,520
Leave it. Go lie down. Sorry.
You can't be too careful these days.

206
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:26,021
Come on, come on.

207
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:29,066
Lock the door, Frisky. Jesus.

208
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,988
Take a break, H.T. Let's go.

209
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:36,907
Stop calling me that
or I'll hang you by your tie.

210
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,452
Yeah, yeah.
Stop showing off for the client.

211
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:42,913
Honey Tits. I say it's endearing.

212
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:46,459
So, what's so important?

213
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,044
Well, they're here.
The end times, kid.

214
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,589
- End times.
- What does that mean?

215
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:53,299
Why'd you drag me here for?

216
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:57,011
You want your money, don't you?
I assume that you do.

217
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:58,387
That couldn't wait?

218
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:01,307
Ever hear of the expression,
"A fart in the wind"?

219
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:05,728
Inside of an hour, that will be me,
I'm hitting the road. I'm out of here.

220
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:09,023
- What, for, like, good?
- For as long as it takes.

221
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,942
I don't like my heat so hot
if you catch my drift.

222
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:14,278
I'm not catching anything you're saying.

223
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:15,696
What is your problem?

224
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:19,200
- You haven't talked to your partner?
- Not since last night.

225
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:23,704
Today, he didn't show up to work
and the DEA just happened to raid us.

226
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:27,249
Yeah, some coincidence, huh?

227
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:29,627
Yeah, I don't know about that.

228
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:33,506
All I know is when he tells me
that your employer took him out

229
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:36,509
threatening to murder his family,
I take notice.

230
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,053
Because after all,
what am I, if not family?

231
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:42,097
What are you talking about?
When did that happen?

232
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,309
I don't know. Forget it.

233
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:47,853
I mean, he exaggerates, right?
He does that.

234
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,022
Hey, listen. Do me a favor.

235
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:55,402
Put in a good word for me with Fring.
I mean, just for old time's sake.

236
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:58,781
I can't afford
to butter the wrong bread here.

237
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:02,201
Yeah?

238
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:31,897
Hey.

239
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,524
Hey.

240
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:37,361
Nothing, huh?

241
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:39,029
Clean as a whistle,

242
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:41,782
so he says.

243
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:01,719
<i>You've reached Walter White.</i>

244
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:04,972
<i>State your name, number
and the reason for your call.</i>

245
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:06,682
<i>Thank you.</i>

246
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,601
It's me again.

247
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,562
I really wish you'd pick up.

248
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:16,525
God, I just...

249
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,654
Call me back, okay?

250
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,156
Just...

251
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:25,284
Just call me back, please.

252
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:46,889
Hi. I'm sorry. Is it okay
if I come out here for a few minutes?

253
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:49,683
Sure.
Just stay up here, if you would.

254
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,310
Okay.

255
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:02,655
Excuse me.

256
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:05,783
I wonder if you have a...
An extra cigarette.

257
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:08,619
I sure could use a smoke right about now.

258
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:10,371
Sure.

259
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,376
Thank you.

260
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:22,883
Thanks.

261
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,881
Hey, what's up?

262
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:06,010
What?

263
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:08,929
Hey. Hey.

264
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:12,182
What's wrong with him?

265
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,894
What hospital?

266
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:21,442
Andrea.

267
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:23,068
Jesse.

268
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,696
- Where's Brock?
- Inside. Grandma's with him.

269
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:30,075
- They got me filling all this paperwork.
- How is he doing? Tell me.

270
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:33,120
The doctors,
they don't know what it is exactly.

271
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:36,373
It's like he's got the flu.

272
00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:40,210
But he just keeps getting worse.

273
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:45,966
Jesse, I don't understand.

274
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:48,135
He was fine this morning.

275
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:52,306
He was fine.

276
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,352
- Andrea Cantillo?
- Right here.

277
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:01,732
Miss Cantillo, we're gonna go
admit your son to the Pediatric ICU.

278
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:04,068
- You can bring that with you.
- Okay.

279
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:06,779
- Sir, you're the boy's father?
- No.

280
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:10,491
Okay. Sorry. It's just we try to keep it
to two visitors maximum.

281
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:14,286
Go, go, go. I'll be out here
if you need me. Go. Go ahead.

282
00:24:42,523 --> 00:24:44,316
No.

283
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,568
No, no.

284
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,987
No. No. No.

285
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:51,448
Come on. Come on.

286
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:54,243
Come on.

287
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:56,787
No. No!

288
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,052
Andrea!

289
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:13,303
Andrea.

290
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,305
- Hey. No yelling.
- I need to...

291
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:18,058
- We can't have you here.
- I need to talk to her.

292
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:20,686
- I need to tell her...
- Take this outside.

293
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:23,188
- My son is sick in here.
- No, just... Come here.

294
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:25,107
Jesse...

295
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:27,609
What is it?

296
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,487
Jesse, I can't go out.
My son's in here.

297
00:25:30,653 --> 00:25:35,450
Okay. I'm thinking Brock
may have been poisoned, okay?

298
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:36,785
What?

299
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:40,414
There's this stuff,
this stuff called ricin.

300
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:43,666
Sounds like rice. You need
to tell the doctors about it.

301
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:45,377
What? How do you know?

302
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:48,671
Doesn't matter.
Just tell them it's a guess. Okay?

303
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:51,425
Ricin.
They'll know what you're talking about.

304
00:25:51,592 --> 00:25:55,304
Jesse, if there's something
you're not saying, you have to tell me.

305
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,431
I gotta go. I gotta go see someone.

306
00:25:57,598 --> 00:25:59,433
- Jesse.
- I'm sorry, I gotta go.

307
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,185
Just tell them, okay?

308
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:03,353
Now. Just do it.

309
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:09,401
Hello. Could you buzz me in, please?

310
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,653
Buzz me in!

311
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:42,059
What do you want?

312
00:26:42,226 --> 00:26:44,102
We need to talk.

313
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:47,981
- Who's with you?
- No one. Just me.

314
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:49,274
Let me in.

315
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:07,876
I don't know what you're thinking
coming here.

316
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,588
Oh, Christ.

317
00:27:11,754 --> 00:27:13,715
What does it matter?

318
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:17,552
Everything, it's all coming to an end.

319
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:20,180
Do you even know what's happening?

320
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:22,683
The full scope of what's happening?

321
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,894
They took me out into the desert.

322
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,854
They put a hood over my head,

323
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:30,607
and drove me out into the desert
on my knees.

324
00:27:30,773 --> 00:27:34,528
They threatened my family,
and not just Hank.

325
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:40,117
My wife, my children.

326
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:47,374
It's just a matter of time now.

327
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:54,548
I was able to protect them for now,
but...

328
00:27:57,467 --> 00:28:00,095
Gus is gonna make his move.

329
00:28:12,983 --> 00:28:17,070
And I don't... I don't know when.

330
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:21,033
I don't know where or how.

331
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:25,704
All I know is it's gonna happen.

332
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:34,546
And I'm powerless to stop him.

333
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:41,094
What are you doing?

334
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,515
Why did you do it?

335
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:47,559
- Why?
- Jesse.

336
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:50,103
Gus gave me no choice.

337
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:53,940
I had to call the DEA to protect
my family. What else could I do...?

338
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:57,569
No. No, you son of a bitch.
You know what you did.

339
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,446
Okay, look, just...

340
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,573
Just put the gun down, okay?

341
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,409
Just put it down and we'll talk,
all right?

342
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:07,579
You tell me what it is you think I did.

343
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:08,955
Brock.

344
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:10,374
Why did you poison him?

345
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:13,585
- Who's Brock?
- You saw him in my living room.

346
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:17,923
You came and you looked right at him,
so don't tell me you don't know him.

347
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,841
The boy?

348
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:23,345
Jesse, I have no idea
who these people are.

349
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:24,596
Now, please.

350
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:28,517
Okay, that's Brock and he was poisoned?

351
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:30,227
The ricin.

352
00:29:30,394 --> 00:29:33,980
He's dying because someone gave it
to him.

353
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:39,111
And only you and I were the only two
people on earth who knew about it.

354
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:40,862
No, wait a minute.

355
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:43,615
Wait a minute.
Maybe he went into your pockets...

356
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,992
No! I had it.

357
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,830
I had the cigarette with the ricin
in my pack this morning.

358
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:52,457
The last time I saw Brock was last night.

359
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:55,836
And this morning, I switched
the cigarette into a new pack.

360
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:58,046
There's no way Brock took it himself.

361
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:00,465
Jesse, you're not thinking clearly.

362
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:03,593
You said it yourself
that you had it this morning.

363
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,971
When could I have possibly gotten it?

364
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:08,473
You had Saul do it.

365
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,016
- What?
- Yeah.

366
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:12,060
Yeah. I went to his office.

367
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,229
He called me in, had to see me today.

368
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:16,398
His big bodyguard patted me down.

369
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:19,484
That's when he must have stole it
off me. Right?

370
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:22,571
That's the plan? Was that the plan?

371
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:26,116
Jesse.

372
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:28,201
Why?

373
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:33,582
Why in God's name would I poison a child?

374
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:36,042
To get back at me.

375
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:38,712
Because I'm helping Gus,

376
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:43,717
and this is your way of ripping my
heart out before you're dead and gone.

377
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:45,719
Just admit it.

378
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:49,222
Admit what you did. Admit it.

379
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:51,516
- I did not do this!
- Shut up!

380
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:53,602
Stop lying!

381
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:55,812
Look, I'm not lying.

382
00:30:55,979 --> 00:31:00,192
I'm not lying. Just listen to me.
What would I have to gain?

383
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:03,778
What possible...? Possible could I...?

384
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:06,281
Who...? Who would...?

385
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,785
Oh, my God.

386
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:15,832
Hey.

387
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:21,129
Stop laughing.

388
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:23,965
Stop laughing!

389
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:30,722
I have been waiting...

390
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:34,142
I've been waiting all day

391
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:39,272
waiting for Gus
to send one of his men to kill me.

392
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:42,859
And it's you.

393
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:50,617
Who do you know
who's okay with using children?

394
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:55,997
Jesse, who do you know who's allowed
children to be murdered?

395
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,707
Gus.

396
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:02,420
He has been 10 steps ahead of me
at every turn.

397
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:06,716
And now, the one thing
that he needed to finally get rid of me

398
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:10,303
is your consent.
And, boy, he's got that now. He's got it.

399
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,639
And not only does he have that

400
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:15,934
he manipulated you
into pulling the trigger for him.

401
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:18,895
No, only you and I knew about the ricin.

402
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:21,189
No, you don't even believe that.

403
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:24,192
Gus has cameras everywhere.
Please.

404
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,986
Listen to yourself.

405
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:28,738
No, he has known everything all along.

406
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:30,949
Where were you today? In the lab?

407
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:35,912
You don't think it's possible that Tyrus
lifted the cigarette out of your locker?

408
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,706
Come on.

409
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:40,250
Don't you see?

410
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:43,003
You are the last piece of the puzzle.

411
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:45,380
You are everything that he's wanted.

412
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:47,465
You're his cook now.

413
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:51,845
You're the cook and you have proven
that you can run a lab without me.

414
00:32:52,012 --> 00:32:55,015
And now that cook has reason to kill me.

415
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:57,726
Think about it.

416
00:32:57,892 --> 00:33:00,103
It's brilliant.

417
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:03,189
So go ahead.

418
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,567
Go on.

419
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:08,653
If you think that I am capable
of doing this

420
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,363
then go

421
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:16,119
put a bullet in my head
and kill me right now.

422
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:20,290
- I'll do it.
- Do it!

423
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:23,710
- Do it.
- I'll do it.

424
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:25,462
Do it.

425
00:33:27,047 --> 00:33:28,715
Do it.

426
00:33:58,244 --> 00:34:00,914
- Where are you going?
- Find the son of a bitch,

427
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:02,874
- and I'm gonna kill him.
- No.

428
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,876
Don't.

429
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:07,128
He'll see you coming.

430
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:13,468
You'll die
before you get anywhere near him.

431
00:34:13,635 --> 00:34:14,719
I don't care.

432
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,554
Jesse.

433
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:19,391
Jesse, just get in your car.

434
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:20,934
Just go.

435
00:34:21,101 --> 00:34:23,019
Just drive.

436
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:25,146
No.

437
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:29,109
I'm going to do this
one way or another, Mr. White.

438
00:34:31,695 --> 00:34:33,780
Then let me help.

439
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:08,190
Jesus. Mr. Pinkman,
I'm not gonna keep telling you.

440
00:35:08,357 --> 00:35:12,194
Unless the family wants you in there,
you're not allowed.

441
00:35:12,361 --> 00:35:15,406
You can't keep coming in here like this.

442
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:17,199
You hear me?

443
00:35:17,366 --> 00:35:18,951
You understand?

444
00:35:19,118 --> 00:35:22,621
Mr. Pinkman, I'm gonna call security.

445
00:35:24,665 --> 00:35:26,166
All right, here I go.

446
00:35:30,004 --> 00:35:31,839
Come on now.

447
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:36,969
Mr. Pinkman, final warning.

448
00:36:05,289 --> 00:36:06,957
Hey.

449
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:11,962
You need to be at work, now.

450
00:36:12,629 --> 00:36:15,674
I already told you. I'm not going.

451
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:20,804
Got a batch that'll be ruined,

452
00:36:20,971 --> 00:36:24,892
and an employer who will be
very upset if that happens.

453
00:36:25,059 --> 00:36:28,520
And I could give a shit.

454
00:36:28,729 --> 00:36:30,481
I'm not leaving here.

455
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:35,402
If my employer has a problem with that,
he can tell me himself.

456
00:36:35,569 --> 00:36:37,571
Not his errand boy.

457
00:36:42,284 --> 00:36:43,577
Idiot.

458
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:46,997
Hey, I don't know this guy.

459
00:36:47,164 --> 00:36:50,751
Call security. I'm being attacked.

460
00:36:56,465 --> 00:36:57,549
Yeah.

461
00:36:58,342 --> 00:37:00,177
That's right.

462
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:16,443
We've got a situation.

463
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:15,854
He'd like to speak with you.

464
00:39:16,355 --> 00:39:18,815
I told you, I'm not leaving.

465
00:39:18,982 --> 00:39:21,235
He's downstairs.

466
00:39:36,375 --> 00:39:38,710
Tyrus told me what's happening.

467
00:39:40,045 --> 00:39:42,089
The sick child.

468
00:39:43,173 --> 00:39:49,012
I understand your preoccupation,
but, Jesse, I am running a business.

469
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:52,766
I need you back at the lab
to complete the cook.

470
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:56,520
You can return when you're done.

471
00:39:58,021 --> 00:39:59,898
I can't.

472
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:04,820
It is, as you must know,
in both of our best interests.

473
00:40:07,197 --> 00:40:11,285
That little boy upstairs is dying.

474
00:40:12,286 --> 00:40:15,998
I can't be away.
I don't even wanna be here now.

475
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:18,709
I can't be away,
if something happens, if he...

476
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:21,461
I am very sorry.

477
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:24,756
Is there anything I can do?

478
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:27,426
I am on the board of this hospital.

479
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:30,095
I can recommend doctors

480
00:40:30,262 --> 00:40:33,015
make sure he gets whatever he needs.

481
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:34,725
The best treatment.

482
00:40:37,019 --> 00:40:38,979
He's not sick.

483
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,524
He was poisoned.

484
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:47,362
How did that happen?

485
00:40:49,906 --> 00:40:51,950
The doctors

486
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:54,995
they don't know.

487
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:08,800
This current batch

488
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:14,431
is surely ruined now, correct?

489
00:41:28,737 --> 00:41:30,697
Stay with the boy.

490
00:41:32,491 --> 00:41:36,244
Tyrus will dump what's there
and clean the tanks.

491
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:41,625
You will start a new batch
when you are ready to return.

492
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:46,546
Next week.

493
00:42:18,412 --> 00:42:20,372
There you are.

494
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,208
There you are.

495
00:42:43,145 --> 00:42:44,312
Keep going.

496
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:06,585
Why did you stop?

497
00:43:07,419 --> 00:43:09,629
Why did you stop?

498
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:18,930
Why did you stop?

499
00:43:24,102 --> 00:43:26,229
Come on. Come on.

500
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,981
Come on. Come on.

501
00:44:39,052 --> 00:44:41,763
No, no, no.
Don't go, don't go, don't go.

502
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:44,099
No. No.

503
00:44:46,476 --> 00:44:48,853
Oh, shit.

504
00:44:51,147 --> 00:44:52,649
No.
