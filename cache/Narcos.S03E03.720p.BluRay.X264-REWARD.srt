But you gotta know what's going on
in Washington.

24
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:44,099
Folks are wondering
if we're gonna win this thing.

00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:47,895

of the Appropriations Committee,

26

27
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:55,653
Now, everyone's proud of the work
you guys did to bring down Escobar.

28
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:59,490
And it's particularly an honour
to meet you, Agent Peña.

29
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:04,745
But cocaine continues to flow north,
and the American people wonder

30
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:08,082
if the Colombians share our enthusiasm
to take this threat head-on.

31
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:13,003
Our colleague, Senator Helms, put
forward some tough language on them.

32
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:16,840
But we wanted to come down here
and get the real from you all.

33
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:18,634
See first-hand what's at stake.

34
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:24,682
See how and... if we can give you
all the support you need.

35

Let's extend the senators
every courtesy while they're here.

36

Their mission is a priority.

00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:42,517
Do you have an address for Jurado?

154
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:44,436
I can get it for you.

155
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:49,733
So what happened
since the last time I saw you?

156
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:52,486
Are you going to take these men on,
or what?

157
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:57,157
- I'm going to do my job.
- And your bosses?

158
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,661
Do they know what you're doing?

159
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:03,372
No comment.

160
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:06,541
♪ Dance with me

161
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:10,253
♪ In my world of fantasy

162
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:13,507
♪ Won't you dance with me?

163
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:17,761
♪ Ritual fertility... ♪

164
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:29,815
I was thinking...

165
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:33,735
...maybe I could come with you.

166
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:38,990
Come on, this could be our last chance
to travel like we used to.

167
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:42,244
- Remember that place in Milan?
- With the leaking roof?

168
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:45,330
On your birthday.
And that terrible risotto.

169
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,958
That balcony.

170
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,380
The brothers are pushing now, baby.
They are opening more accounts.

171
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:55,841
- It's dangerous.
- I don't care.

172
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:03,849
How high are you right now?

173
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:06,768
Hey, fuck you!

174
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:08,812
Give me your passport.

175
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,566
I can't stay in this apartment anymore,
Franklin.

176
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:15,861
I can't watch another movie
with subtitles by myself.

177
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:18,655
I don't want to listen to the cartel wives
talk about their husbands like...

178
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,616
- With an English degree from Harvard...
- Please don't tell me I can teach.

179
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:25,162
Then what did you want me to say?
Fuck...

180
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,874
We'll do this another time.

181
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,005
The dining room is over here.

182
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:37,883
You have a room over here.

183
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:40,093
You have another one over here.

184
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:43,096
And here, you have the living room.

185
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:52,063
The dimmer is over here.

186
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:56,443
And you can adjust the light.

187
00:12:58,028 --> 00:13:00,489
Well... you get the idea.

188
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:05,202
- No. I don't understand.
- What don't you understand?

189
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:07,120
Does this seem normal to you?

190
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:08,705
You indicated to Mr. Rodríguez

191
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,666
you were uncertain about returning
to the North Valley.

192
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:15,378
And that's why he bought me a palace.
With dimmers.

193
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:18,799
Please tell Don Miguel thank you,

194
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:21,927
but I need to think
about his generous offer.

195
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:26,139
We have that dinner tonight.

196
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,266
With your friends?

197
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:30,977
With the investors.

198
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:34,689
They're not going to like
the six-month delay.

199
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:39,528
And I think it's best if we don't mention
the Rodríguez brothers by name.

200
00:13:43,532 --> 00:13:46,117
I know you're embarrassed by what I do.

201
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,043
I know you did it for your family.

202
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:58,004
But if these people like everything
they hear tonight,

203
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:01,007
you'll have your own security firm
the second these six months are up.

204
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:04,886
- Ready!
- Good.

205
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:08,306
A choir!

206
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:10,016
All right, say goodbye to Dad.
We're leaving.

207
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:11,852
- Bye.
- Bye.

208
00:14:11,977 --> 00:14:14,563
All right. Let's go, or we'll be late.

209
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:17,315
Will you make it on time?

210
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,526
If you're wearing the dress
with the flowers, yes.

211
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:26,116
Let's go, girls.

212
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:29,411
Today is a busy day for us, boys.

213
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:33,331
Bosses have meetings all day
at the National Hotel.

214
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:38,128
I need you to pre-sweep
each and every location on this schedule.

215
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:42,299
And I don't want a bunch of cars parked
like bullshit, blocking escape routes.

216
00:14:42,424 --> 00:14:46,678
- He's looking at you, Montez.
- Of course I'm talking to you, you idiot.

217
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:51,016
Don Miguel's team on channel six.
Don Gilberto's, channel eight.

218
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:53,560
Jorge says that the DEA is visiting Cali.

219
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:58,648
Two agents from Bogotá. They're new.
They're working with the National Police.

220
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,444
But they don't have warrants.
They're tourists.

221
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:04,905
They need permission
to wipe their own asses.

222
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:10,869
Regardless, while they're in Cali,
we'll be watching them.

223
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:14,706
- That's your job, Enrique, my brother.
- Yes, sir.

224
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:16,625
That's all, gentlemen.

225
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,336
Communicate. Stay safe. Get to work.

226
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:26,635
I have to duck out early.
It's a work thing for Paola.

227
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,096
Of course.
Do you want to practise your English?

228
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:32,724
Starkman, the American lawyer,
arrives today.

229
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:35,101
Can you pick him up from the airport?

230
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:38,730
Aren't you worried about the tourists?

231
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:42,359
The second team's
never as good as the first.

232
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:57,832
Got a look at the directory.
That company moved out three months ago.

233
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,710
If they were ever there at all.

234
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:13,556
Quiet part of the city here.

235
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:18,478
- Cartel keep Cali buttoned down?
- Nobody talks.

236
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:22,023
All the multinationals
used to have offices here in Cali.

237
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,441
"Used to"?

238
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:27,237
Pulled out because of the city's ties
to the narcotics trade.

239
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:31,241
The Rodríguez brothers
are the only game in town now.

240
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:35,787
Fucking drug dealers
pretending to be stockbrokers.

241
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:40,375
Motherfuckers ruined this city.

242
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:45,672
Where are we headed next?

243
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:48,591
Please.

244
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,304
This way, Mr. Starkman.

245
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:57,100
How the hell are you supposed
to fly international if you can't smoke?

246
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:59,060
I guess you can always quit.

247
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:03,481
And let United Airlines
tell me how to live?

248
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:09,571
Remind me again... Kansas City?

249
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,741
- Leavenworth.
- What the fuck for?

250
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:15,452
My father was in the army.
There's a base there.

251
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:20,373
They sent him to train.
I was like... seven years old.

252
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:23,334
What? It's America.

253
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,378
That's for sure.

254
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,881
So am I meeting the brothers
at the hotel?

255
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:28,923
Yes.

256
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:32,677
Serious stones on these guys.

257
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:36,347
Retiring,
like they run Lehman Brothers.

258
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:39,059
It's a good break for you, though.

259
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:41,770
You'll get immunity
when the surrender goes through.

260
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:45,398
I don't sell cocaine.
I don't shoot anyone.

261
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:49,694
You're a member of the Cali cartel.
You ever hear of conspiracy,<i>amigo?</i>

262
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:54,824
Relax, I got this. Look, they're lucky
to have us both, Jorge.

263
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:57,619
You can't put a price on freedom.

264
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,126
Though Lord knows I try.

265
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:12,342
I assume you would prefer U.S. currency?

266
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:13,968
Of course.

267
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:18,389
Currency aside, we aren't in
the habit of paying for things in advance.

268
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:21,476
What guarantee do we have that
you will provide what you promise?

269
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:23,061
Forgive my brother.

270
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:26,564
We are grateful for the support
you and your people have offered.

271
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:29,651
This afternoon, our associate,
Mr. Pallomari,

272
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:33,071
will prepare the contribution
and arrange delivery.

273
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,615
Very well.

274
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:39,869
The contribution should be divided
among seven men.

275
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:41,246
Their names are on the list.

276
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:47,919
All right, very well. Going forward,

277
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:51,881
I think it's best if Mr. Pallomari deals
with my colleague, Mr. Giraldo.

278
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:54,384
As you wish.

279
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,804
Have a great day, gentlemen.

280
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:09,023
Well, our surrender has been bought.
Now it must be paid for.

281
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:13,695
And they say we're the criminals.

282
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:16,573
Sons of bitches.

283
00:19:16,698 --> 00:19:20,994
Small price to pay, brother,
for the rest of your life.

284
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:23,288
Gentlemen, I will prepare
these payments myself,

285
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:25,123
as soon as I'm back in the office.

286
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,710
And I'll make sure
that all of this is in order.

287
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,880
Mr. Starkman is next, the lawyer.

288
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:36,009
If you ever make it to Miami
and you need a lawyer...

289
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,345
...hit me up.

290
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,723
I wasn't planning on it,
but thank you, Mr. Starkman.

291
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:43,850
Yeah, nobody ever plans on it.

292
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:48,438
- Mr. Starkman. Welcome to Cali.
- Yeah.

293
00:19:48,563 --> 00:19:51,733
The Rodríguez brothers
are pleased to welcome you.

294
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:55,320
No offence, but remind me again
what you do?

295
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:58,698
I'm the chief accountant
to the Rodríguez brothers.

296
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:02,994
What happened to the other guy?
The good-looking one? Pacho?

297
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,454
Mr. Herrera?

298
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:08,416
Yeah, I bet he's the guy who's got
all the pussy in town on speed dial.

299
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,710
Yeah. Please, sir.

300
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,630
- 'Feistl.'
- How's it going?

301
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:18,551
Well, slow so far,
but Calderón seems like good police.

302
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:21,596
- Yeah? Good.
- 'That journalist come through?'

303
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:24,057
I'm on the money man right now.

304
00:20:24,182 --> 00:20:26,267
- See where he takes me.
<i>- Gracias.</i>

305
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:28,144
Eyes open, Feistl.

306
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:30,730
- Everything by the book.
- 'Will do.'

307
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:34,234
- Keep me posted.
- Baby, wait...

308
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:40,865
- I'm sorry.
- Come here.

309
00:21:11,646 --> 00:21:13,523
The Arellano Felix brothers

310
00:21:13,648 --> 00:21:15,733
are still wasting time with heroin.

311
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:19,362
Hey! What?
You're not going to say hello?

312
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:21,906
- Hello.
- Are you in a bad mood or what?

313
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:38,798
Amado... this is the life.

314
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:40,591
You guys helped me.

315
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:43,678
I moved the last 100 tons
in less than 50 days.

316
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:46,556
You tell me if we're a great team or not.

317
00:21:46,681 --> 00:21:50,893
That's why we're here.
Can you handle a bigger package?

318
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:55,523
I'm the Lord of the Skies, brother.
What do you think?

319
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:58,067
'Amado Carrillo Fuentes.

320
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:00,111
'Leader of the Juárez cartel.

321
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:03,072
'He was one of the most
enterprising traffickers in Mexico

322
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:06,659
'and one of the first to get into business
with his Colombian friends to the south.

323
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:09,912
'While Escobar saw
the Mexican traffickers as a threat,

324
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:12,206
'Cali saw them as a partner.

325
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:16,169
'A partner that shared over 1,900 miles
of virtually undefended border

326
00:22:16,294 --> 00:22:19,172
'with Cali's biggest customer:
the United States.

327
00:22:19,297 --> 00:22:22,258
'And right about the time
the Caribbean corridor closed,

328
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:26,637
'along came NAFTA, and the U.S.
- Mexico border was open for business.

329
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:28,348
'And Amado took full advantage,

330
00:22:28,473 --> 00:22:31,184
'agreeing to ferry Cali cocaine
into the States.

331
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:33,770
'They called it
"The Mexican Trampoline",

332
00:22:33,895 --> 00:22:37,982
'bouncing cocaine into America,
and bouncing cash right back.'

333
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:40,777
I can move however much you give me.

334
00:22:40,902 --> 00:22:43,529
I just have two questions:
How much?

335
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:47,492
And for how much longer, Pacho?

336
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:50,119
Because I know about your deal.

337
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:52,413
I know you want to turn yourselves in.

338
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,834
There is a deal on the table, Amado.

339
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:59,796
But we have six months
to turn ourselves in. That's the truth.

340
00:23:01,464 --> 00:23:04,258
Until then, we will honour
our commitment to you.

341
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:08,471
Right, and after?
What happens after that?

342
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:12,975
The business will adjust.

343
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:18,398
This I know. It will always adjust.
This will never end.

344
00:23:18,523 --> 00:23:22,735
There will be other partners
and more drugs. But what about you?

345
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,612
What will happen to you?

346
00:23:25,488 --> 00:23:30,535
You can't tell me you're going to retire,
as if this was any normal business.

347
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:33,496
You know this is a way of life.

348
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:35,957
It retires you when it's done with you.

349
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:41,462
Or are you going to start playing golf
like an old man?

350
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:57,270
We need to count on you maintaining
the same terms on this last shipment.

351
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:04,068
Done.

352
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:07,071
It'll be my gift to the Gentlemen of Cali.

353
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:11,409
All right? But...
you have to come with me to Juárez.

354
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:16,289
- I want to show you something.
- What is it?

355
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:20,710
The future, Pacho.

356
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,213
The fucking future, that's all.

357
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:31,804
- Here's your passport.
- Thank you.

358
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:36,684
All right, and you board through Gate 15.

359
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:38,019
Okay.

360
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:43,483
- Have a great trip.
- Thank you.

361
00:24:44,275 --> 00:24:45,693
Have a great day.

362
00:24:46,194 --> 00:24:47,195
Next.

363
00:24:53,284 --> 00:24:54,869
I'm going to Panama.

364
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:57,205
I need you to radio ahead
to the DEA office.

365
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:59,457
I'm afraid not. This plane can't take off.
There's new orders.

366
00:24:59,582 --> 00:25:01,459
What are you talking about?

367
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:05,296
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm not looking for that kind of trouble.

368
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:07,465
Oh, shit.

369
00:25:12,887 --> 00:25:14,597
What the fuck is going on?

370
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:17,975
Orders are orders.
You heard the ambassador.

371
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:24,815
Our friends from the Senate here
want the down-low from a real-life hero.

372
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:27,777
Guess that's you.

373
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:31,322
You got somewhere better to be?

374
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:34,492
You wore the wrong shoes.

375
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:43,000
Fuck.

376
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:51,092
Is that the Río Negro?

377
00:26:02,937 --> 00:26:06,315
- What do we got here?
- The captain likes this one.

378
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,484
You won't find their name on the lease,

379
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:11,529
but the Rodríguez brothers
own the top six floors.

380
00:26:12,363 --> 00:26:14,198
Oh, fuck. For real?

381
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:16,659
I told you,
there are some honest cops in Cali.

382
00:26:17,702 --> 00:26:19,620
Let me reach out to men I trust.

383
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:22,707
Quietly. Keep an eye on this place.

384
00:26:22,832 --> 00:26:26,586
You go back to Bogotáand...
get a warrant.

385
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:31,048
Come on, guys,
the place isn't moving anywhere.

386
00:26:31,591 --> 00:26:34,927
Get that paper
and we'll turn this place upside down.

387
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:39,140
Why wait? Judge in Bogotásigned
a warrant for us before we left.

388
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:45,146
SEARCH WARRANT

389
00:26:46,063 --> 00:26:48,357
Which you never told me about.

390
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:51,402
This is the kind of bullshit I don't like.

391
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:53,362
Are you playing me or what?

392
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:56,782
Hey, man, it's like you said.
It's so hard to know who to trust.

393
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,744
I wasn't even
sure we were gonna need it.

394
00:27:01,621 --> 00:27:03,164
There's no address on this warrant.

395
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:06,334
You said this place is connected,
so let's put in some work.

396
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:08,753
Do you know the kind of shit
I could land in?

397
00:27:09,629 --> 00:27:10,755
Huh?

398
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,758
I don't have a DEA pension
waiting for me.

399
00:27:14,634 --> 00:27:17,219
Pensions aren't that great, to be honest.

400
00:27:24,602 --> 00:27:25,936
Fuck.

401
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:28,522
Let's do it.

402
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:35,404
I need a tactical team sent
to 15th Street and 4th Avenue, copy?

403
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:37,531
'Copy that.
Requesting a tactical team

404
00:27:37,657 --> 00:27:39,659
'at 15th Street and 4th Avenue.'

405
00:27:39,784 --> 00:27:42,036
You do realise, don't you,

406
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:45,081
after we surrender,
all of this shit will end?

407
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:49,835
No more sitting by the pool,
smoking your cigar,

408
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,672
telling everyone what to do.

409
00:27:52,797 --> 00:27:55,633
Look, Miguel,
I'm tired of telling people what to do.

410
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,553
And no one has ever listened to you.

411
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:02,848
What's the difference?

412
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:12,650
But you know what?

413
00:28:12,775 --> 00:28:17,988
Never, in human history, have
two brothers accomplished what we have.

414
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:24,745
We aren't the first people in history
to build an empire, Gilberto.

415
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:28,207
But we're the first to retire
leaving the empire intact.

416
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:34,255
If Mother were alive, she'd be proud.

417
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:37,717
Brothers are well, nephews are well,
sons are well.

418
00:28:40,845 --> 00:28:42,763
'Boss, we just heard a call

419
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:47,017
'that a tactical team left Jamundí station
heading to 4th Avenue.'

420
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:50,938
Enrique, where are you?

421
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:53,023
Watching our visitors from the DEA.

422
00:28:53,149 --> 00:28:55,401
They've been checking addresses
all over town.

423
00:28:55,526 --> 00:28:57,653
But right now, they're stopped,
just doing nothing.

424
00:28:57,778 --> 00:29:02,283
- Yes, but where are you?
- At 15th Street and... 4th Avenue.

425
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:03,868
Enrique, fuck!

426
00:29:03,993 --> 00:29:07,496
There's a police convoy coming at you!
Get Pallomari out of there now!

427
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:33,731
Answer, you bastard, answer.

428
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:39,278
- Hello? What's up?
- 'Listen, it's Salcedo.'

429
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:42,031
You're going to have unwelcome guests.
Leave now.

430
00:29:42,156 --> 00:29:46,076
I don't have time for this.
I'm supervising an important project.

431
00:29:46,202 --> 00:29:48,788
'That's exactly why I need you
to get out.'

432
00:29:48,913 --> 00:29:50,831
Just because you say so?

433
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:53,584
I know you're arranging an important
transaction for the bosses this afternoon.

434
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:55,836
Listen, this is none of your business.

435
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:58,339
'I'll bet your desk is covered
with American dollars.

436
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:00,216
'Look, Guillermo, please.'

437
00:30:00,341 --> 00:30:03,928
You've got papers. You've got names.
You've got things that shouldn't be seen.

438
00:30:04,053 --> 00:30:05,346
- Jorge...
- 'Get out of there!'

439
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:07,431
You do your job and I'll do mine.

440
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:11,435
This is my job! I'm telling you...
Son of a bitch!

441
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,588
Fuck your mother.

442
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:42,591
I need you to check the paper shredders

443
00:30:42,716 --> 00:30:44,635
and the floppy disks
still in the computers.

444
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:48,848
Invoices. Bills of lading.
Anything on the computers.

445
00:30:48,973 --> 00:30:51,934
- Warrant says paper only.
- Yeah? Warrants say a lot of things.

446
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:54,895
- Let's go!
- At least someone's willing to get wet.

447
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,398
Don't worry, you'll be back
in Intelligence Group soon enough.

448
00:30:57,523 --> 00:31:00,818
It's not...
This is a waste of our time, Chris.

449
00:31:00,943 --> 00:31:03,529
And more importantly,
this is a waste of a warrant.

450
00:31:04,405 --> 00:31:06,282
You know what?

451
00:31:07,116 --> 00:31:09,952
Andrew Jackson here says
all we find in this fucking high rise

452
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:11,370
is a nice view of the city.

453
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:14,832
Well, I got... whoever this guy is
and he says otherwise.

454
00:31:21,005 --> 00:31:22,965
Fucking shit!

455
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:40,733
Gentlemen, how may I help you?

456
00:31:40,858 --> 00:31:42,526
Seventh floor. Mr. Pallomari's office.

457
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:44,862
All right. I'll let them know you're here
so you can head up.

458
00:31:46,322 --> 00:31:48,991
People love surprises.

459
00:31:49,116 --> 00:31:51,702
Gentlemen, you can't...

460
00:32:26,362 --> 00:32:28,781
You. What the fuck
are you still doing here?

461
00:32:28,906 --> 00:32:31,700
What the fuck am I doing? My job.
We told your associate the same thing.

462
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:33,369
Sorry, boss, I tried,
but he won't listen.

463
00:32:33,494 --> 00:32:35,371
- You go get the car.
- Please get out.

464
00:32:35,496 --> 00:32:37,623
- I have to finish this. Fuck your mother.
- Take the back stairs.

465
00:32:37,748 --> 00:32:39,583
- Yes, sir.
- Finish what?

466
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:41,377
My job, Jorge.

467
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:46,131
No. Please, we have to get rid
of all of that now.

468
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:48,342
We aren't arguing.
You aren't touching anything.

469
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:50,302
I've got a method and a system.

470
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:52,054
A method and a system?

471
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:55,099
What you've got is ten years of jail time
sitting on your desk, you idiot.

472
00:32:55,224 --> 00:32:56,725
- Get out.
- No.

473
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,436
Attention!
Colombian National Police!

474
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:04,358
- Where are the files?
- Get to work. Let's go!

475
00:33:06,235 --> 00:33:08,362
This is an office.

476
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:11,240
We're working. How can I help you?

477
00:33:11,365 --> 00:33:14,660
We need access to your files, invoices,
and all of your correspondence.

478
00:33:18,247 --> 00:33:21,166
If that's the case,
I need to see a warrant.

479
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:23,627
Are you supposed to be in charge?

480
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:28,382
Well, yes, I'm in charge.

481
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,311
Come on.

482
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:56,910
Good morning.
I have to see every invoice you have.

483
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:08,088
This says documents only.
Fuck your mother.

484
00:34:09,173 --> 00:34:12,176
Could you repeat that, sir?
My Spanish is... is a bit rough.

485
00:34:12,301 --> 00:34:13,969
You didn't get that?

486
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:16,138
- Only papers.
- Documents only.

487
00:34:17,264 --> 00:34:18,432
All right.

488
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:20,768
Keep an eye on the things
they're taking. Now!

489
00:34:20,893 --> 00:34:21,977
Yes, sir.

490
00:34:31,195 --> 00:34:33,197
Leave it. Let it be.

491
00:34:33,322 --> 00:34:35,616
Chivo, check everything
and make an inventory, all right?

492
00:34:45,084 --> 00:34:47,294
Hey, I like presents.
What'd you get us?

493
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:48,629
That's private.

494
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:50,881
Ignacio, please show the gentleman
last year's documents.

495
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:52,674
This way, please.

496
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,730
Excuse me, sir.

497
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:42,391
I must insist.

498
00:35:53,026 --> 00:35:55,529
Your phone's off the hook.

499
00:36:03,996 --> 00:36:07,207
Do you have
a bill of lading? Yes? Let me see.

500
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:09,835
More? Everything.

501
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,253
- Just these?
- And the copies below.

502
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:12,713
- These as well, no?
- Yes, sir.

503
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:15,924
- All right. '93. Yeah?
- Those are the most recent.

504
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:25,767
Grab that.

505
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,564
Looks like you owe me that 20.

506
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:31,773
Oh, yeah.

507
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:35,444
You were right.

508
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:12,689
This area saw the biggest spike
in trafficking after Escobar was killed.

509
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:15,776
Can't we just spray chemicals
on this place and be done with it?

510
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:19,655
Unfortunately, agricultural concerns
in the region won't allow it.

511
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:22,032
That's right.
Chiquita Bananas is down here.

512
00:37:22,491 --> 00:37:24,910
I know those guys. Big contributors.

513
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:29,706
Okay. Here we are.

514
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:36,088
Jesus H. Christ.

515
00:37:38,548 --> 00:37:40,634
Must've been one hell of a firefight, huh?

516
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:42,427
No doubt, sir.

517
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:44,429
- Gentlemen, this is Captain Mills.
- Captain.

518
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:47,015
- Our advisor on this mission down here.
- How you doing, sir?

519
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:50,227
He liaised with a team of Colombian
commandos on this raid here.

520
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:54,898
These guys FARC or traffickers?

521
00:37:55,691 --> 00:37:57,234
Both.

522
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:01,113
Probably started out doing security
for the traffickers, or extorting them.

523
00:38:02,656 --> 00:38:04,616
FARC wants to overthrow
the government.

524
00:38:05,242 --> 00:38:08,870
Cocaine finances their struggles.
Top of the line.

525
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:13,125
There's an arms race
going on down here.

526
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:14,543
And this shit...

527
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:17,254
...is jet fuel.

528
00:38:19,298 --> 00:38:20,924
You guys ready for lunch?

529
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:24,344
Lunch?
Yeah. Sure. Why not?

530
00:38:30,434 --> 00:38:32,060
Go. Go. Go.

531
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:44,614
This 24-hour party thing...

532
00:38:46,158 --> 00:38:48,368
...is tiring after a couple of days.

533
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:54,916
Can you imagine if it was your life?

534
00:38:59,463 --> 00:39:01,465
What's on your mind?

535
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:06,511
Dad, and the last thing he said to me.

536
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:10,432
- What? "Get the fuck out"?
- No.

537
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:15,437
He said that in this world...

538
00:39:16,772 --> 00:39:20,692
...there was no place
for a man like me.

539
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:27,449
I made a place for myself.

540
00:39:29,076 --> 00:39:31,203
I proved him wrong.

541
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:36,541
And now, I have to give it all up.

542
00:39:41,213 --> 00:39:44,216
What kind of man would I be
if I gave it all up?

543
00:39:44,341 --> 00:39:45,842
I don't know, brother.

544
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:51,807
But what I do know is
that you have a couple billion dollars

545
00:39:51,932 --> 00:39:55,227
and the rest of your life
to figure it out.

546
00:40:02,776 --> 00:40:04,236
'What are they giving me?

547
00:40:04,361 --> 00:40:06,530
What do you mean,
what are they giving you?

548
00:40:06,655 --> 00:40:08,990
They took my son, didn't they?

549
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:11,910
They have to give us something.

550
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:18,458
- Have they offered you something?
- An apartment.

551
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:21,628
'Accept it.
Afterwards, I'll sell it for cash.

552
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:25,590
'We'll take their money now.
Later, we'll take vengeance.

553
00:40:25,715 --> 00:40:28,510
- 'Do it, then get back up here.'
- Can you wake Pedro up?

554
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:32,264
- I want to speak with him.
- 'Don't worry about Pedro. He's sleeping.'

555
00:40:40,439 --> 00:40:44,776
- I heard we cut it close today.
- I thought they didn't have a warrant.

556
00:40:45,402 --> 00:40:47,446
That's what I was told
by our friend on the force.

557
00:40:47,571 --> 00:40:50,657
A few more seconds
and we'd have had real trouble.

558
00:40:51,283 --> 00:40:54,619
Those new DEA guys
are sharper than they look.

559
00:40:55,912 --> 00:40:57,706
Well, luckily, we have you.

560
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:02,544
- Did they get anything?
- Some files.

561
00:41:02,669 --> 00:41:06,298
So nothing. Good.
I'll take care of the rest today.

562
00:41:06,423 --> 00:41:10,802
That thing you've got tonight with Paola,
enjoy yourself. Go on.

563
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:25,567
We got names,
addresses. These files are legit.

564
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:29,571
- How are you guys?
- Captain.

565
00:41:30,572 --> 00:41:32,866
We'll catalogue
and seal the ones from today.

566
00:41:33,325 --> 00:41:35,285
If you could help us with transport...

567
00:41:36,203 --> 00:41:38,997
Okay, there must be
a misunderstanding.

568
00:41:40,624 --> 00:41:43,251
The files stay here.

569
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:45,670
We need to sort through these.

570
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:48,465
As you can see, we know
how to process evidence, Feistl.

571
00:41:49,382 --> 00:41:53,345
- That wasn't the deal. This was our intel.
- It was a CNP operation.

572
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:54,971
We let you join, support.

573
00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:58,517
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- No, I'm not.

574
00:41:58,642 --> 00:41:59,935
I'm not.

575
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:03,230
But anything we find
we'll be sure to share with you.

576
00:42:03,355 --> 00:42:06,233
I was instructed
you should be back in Bogotátonight.

577
00:42:06,816 --> 00:42:08,818
You're going out on the last flight.

578
00:42:13,573 --> 00:42:15,325
He burned us.

579
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:18,203
Who's that, Chris?
The last honest cop in Cali?

580
00:42:19,788 --> 00:42:22,916
No, man. He clowned me, too.
I'm calling the boss.

581
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:35,554
Fuck!

582
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:42,227
Those things ain't going
25 feet down here.

583
00:42:43,812 --> 00:42:45,981
Thanks. Hey, you DOD?

584
00:42:47,399 --> 00:42:50,026
So they say.
But I still ID as a Marine.

585
00:42:50,527 --> 00:42:52,571
I'm part
of the military assistance package.

586
00:42:52,696 --> 00:42:55,031
- CIA?
- Oh, shit. Fuck, no.

587
00:42:55,991 --> 00:42:57,617
Can I get a smoke?

588
00:43:02,914 --> 00:43:04,249
Thanks.

589
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:10,213
- Where you from?
- The last place? Pendleton.

590
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:13,758
I was out there teaching Saudi soldiers
how to do jumping jacks.

591
00:43:13,883 --> 00:43:16,595
That shit's a lot harder than it sounds.

592
00:43:18,138 --> 00:43:22,392
- So is it really that bad down here?
- Yeah. It is.

593
00:43:22,517 --> 00:43:25,770
You got paramilitary, FARC,
traffickers, us.

594
00:43:27,022 --> 00:43:29,357
Some pretty hairy bullshit down here.

595
00:43:29,482 --> 00:43:32,193
Right, but not hairy enough
for the truth to make its case.

596
00:43:34,029 --> 00:43:37,240
Magazines on those bodies
are 7.62 millimetre.

597
00:43:38,116 --> 00:43:40,952
They go in an AK-47, right?

598
00:43:42,746 --> 00:43:47,083
Those guns, the fancy ones,
they chamber in a 5.56.

599
00:43:51,046 --> 00:43:53,381
This whole thing is staged.

600
00:43:53,506 --> 00:43:57,552
Those are run-of-the-mill guerrillas.
Peasants, not traffickers.

601
00:43:57,677 --> 00:43:59,262
You know your guns.

602
00:44:02,766 --> 00:44:04,768
I'm gonna head on down.

603
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:11,274
So very original, Stechner.

604
00:44:12,942 --> 00:44:14,736
Even for the CIA.

605
00:44:15,528 --> 00:44:20,533
Yeah, well, sometimes you need
to make the truth a little more... plain.

606
00:44:25,872 --> 00:44:28,500
Well, how's this for truth?

607
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:33,296
They go home and tell everyone
the war on drugs is a fucking stage show.

608
00:44:34,631 --> 00:44:38,051
And all the money they put in
is pissed away.

609
00:44:39,928 --> 00:44:42,555
Even the hero said it's fucked up.

610
00:44:44,391 --> 00:44:46,393
What's that do to your plan?

611
00:44:48,228 --> 00:44:50,271
I'm gonna level with you, fellas.

612
00:44:50,397 --> 00:44:52,440
Sending a five-billion-dollar aid package

613
00:44:52,565 --> 00:44:57,112
to a country that's on the verge
of becoming a narco-democracy,

614
00:44:57,237 --> 00:44:58,822
that's a bad look in the Senate.

615
00:44:58,947 --> 00:45:02,701
All due respect, Senator, you're looking
at a petri dish for the next Castro,

616
00:45:02,826 --> 00:45:04,661
and this one's fed by narco dollars.

617
00:45:04,786 --> 00:45:07,997
And not just here. Venezuela, Honduras.

618
00:45:08,123 --> 00:45:11,126
Rich dictators
with anti-American hard-ons.

619
00:45:11,251 --> 00:45:14,129
We turn our back on this place,
it all goes to hell.

620
00:45:17,507 --> 00:45:24,055
Colombia is perfectly situated to help us
in both Central and South America.

621
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:27,892
The right American footprint here,
Black Hawks, small arms,

622
00:45:28,017 --> 00:45:30,353
night vision, advisors like Mills...

623
00:45:31,604 --> 00:45:35,150
...we help secure a stable Colombia,

624
00:45:35,734 --> 00:45:37,819
and it becomes a beacon for the region.

625
00:45:38,945 --> 00:45:40,655
Well, if you want the American people

626
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:43,616
to get behind sending
billions of dollars to Colombia...

627
00:45:44,826 --> 00:45:47,412
...we need
a no-fucking-around victory down here.

628
00:45:47,537 --> 00:45:50,165
Look, gentlemen,
the Colombian government

629
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:54,711
is months away from dismantling one
of the biggest drug cartels in history.

630
00:45:54,836 --> 00:45:58,339
And they will do it
without firing a shot.

631
00:45:58,882 --> 00:46:01,926
No body count, no dirty hands.

632
00:46:02,051 --> 00:46:04,804
I can't imagine the folks back home
won't like that.

633
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:08,850
Agent Peña.

634
00:46:09,976 --> 00:46:15,523
What do you think?
Is it true? Is a big win coming?

635
00:46:19,611 --> 00:46:21,446
Agent Stechner and I...

636
00:46:23,573 --> 00:46:27,660
...we have a long-standing difference
of opinion on just about everything.

637
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:32,832
But he and I can both agree...

638
00:46:34,459 --> 00:46:36,544
...a big win is coming.

639
00:46:51,476 --> 00:46:53,770
Glad we're on the same page,
Agent Peña.

640
00:46:54,312 --> 00:46:57,857
So the whole surrender plan
is about fucking fundraising!

641
00:46:58,983 --> 00:47:02,987
The Colombians get a cheque and
you get to play army men in the jungle?

642
00:47:03,112 --> 00:47:05,782
I'm thinking about the next battle,
the one that really counts.

643
00:47:05,907 --> 00:47:08,618
Which means you're willing
to lose this one!

644
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:15,083
The drug war?
Oh, come on, man! We lost it!

645
00:47:15,208 --> 00:47:16,960
You were there!

646
00:47:18,378 --> 00:47:22,841
Ever stop and think that anyone
that takes this as personally as you do

647
00:47:22,966 --> 00:47:24,968
is doing it wrong?

648
00:47:29,681 --> 00:47:33,476
- Fuck you!
- Yeah. See ya!

649
00:48:09,304 --> 00:48:10,722
And where are they now?

650
00:48:10,847 --> 00:48:12,765
'I just put them on a plane to Bogotá.'

651
00:48:12,891 --> 00:48:14,559
- And the files?
- 'We've got them.'

652
00:48:14,684 --> 00:48:16,227
Are you sure?

653
00:48:16,352 --> 00:48:20,106
Look, they tricked me
with that fucking warrant, all right?

654
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:24,861
'And I couldn't warn you because
we were all together like a fucking family.'

655
00:48:24,986 --> 00:48:28,156
These Americans know
what they're doing.

656
00:48:28,281 --> 00:48:30,617
'They aren't fucking idiots.'

657
00:48:34,537 --> 00:48:36,664
Ever tell you I did a rotation in Chile?

658
00:48:38,082 --> 00:48:41,210
No, Dan, you never told me
you did a rotation in fucking Chile.

659
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:44,923
The accountant.

660
00:48:46,132 --> 00:48:48,760
- You clock his accent?
- No.

661
00:48:49,302 --> 00:48:53,306
A little off. You know, he said something:
<i>"Concha su madre."</i>

662
00:48:53,431 --> 00:48:55,767
Okay, what's that?
"Fuck your mother" or something?

663
00:48:55,892 --> 00:49:00,063
Exactly. But then he said
another word: "<i>Cachai."</i>

664
00:49:00,188 --> 00:49:03,358
It's a phrase that they typically
only use in Chile.

665
00:49:05,026 --> 00:49:07,320
And if he's from Chile...

666
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:09,155
He can be extradited.

667
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:21,668
'Panama DEA said
no warrant, no detention.'

668
00:49:21,793 --> 00:49:24,629
- Fuck.
- 'Plus, Jurado didn't stay in Panama.'

669
00:49:24,754 --> 00:49:28,424
- They know where he went?
- No.

670
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:31,427
So Jurado could be anywhere.
Fuck!

671
00:49:31,552 --> 00:49:35,431
'Also, boss, Feistl and Van Ness
have been trying you. A lot.'

672
00:49:35,556 --> 00:49:38,643
All right, well, put them through
when you get them. I'm on my way back.

673
00:49:38,768 --> 00:49:40,561
- 'And Stoddard?'
- Yeah, boss?

674
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:45,858
Jurado has a wife in Bogotá.
She's American. Put a tap on her phone.

675
00:49:47,235 --> 00:49:49,404
- I don't think I can do that.
- 'Just do it.'

676
00:49:55,868 --> 00:49:59,956
Well, the truth is, we're
very interested in your proposal, Jorge.

677
00:50:00,081 --> 00:50:02,125
And in your potential for growth.

678
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:06,254
You've exceeded Paola's description,
which wasn't easy.

679
00:50:07,755 --> 00:50:11,551
Of course, we were inconvenienced
by the six-month delay,

680
00:50:11,676 --> 00:50:13,511
which took us by surprise.

681
00:50:16,097 --> 00:50:18,516
I take my commitments very seriously,
gentlemen.

682
00:50:18,641 --> 00:50:22,020
And I couldn't leave without ensuring
my replacement met the standard

683
00:50:22,145 --> 00:50:23,938
they've come to expect.

684
00:50:24,063 --> 00:50:25,398
Go wait for him over there.

685
00:50:25,523 --> 00:50:28,192
- Good evening. How are you?
- Good, thank you.

686
00:50:32,739 --> 00:50:35,283
Well, I think that merits
another bottle of wine, no?

687
00:50:35,408 --> 00:50:36,409
Yes.

688
00:50:38,578 --> 00:50:44,042
Look at that son of a bitch.
Thinks his shit doesn't stink, or what?

689
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:53,509
Thank you.

690
00:50:53,634 --> 00:50:55,553
So, a security expert

691
00:50:55,678 --> 00:50:59,974
married to a rising star
in one of Cali's top law firms.

692
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:02,435
Have you worked together before?

693
00:51:04,645 --> 00:51:07,065
My compliments.

694
00:51:09,108 --> 00:51:10,318
David Rodríguez.

695
00:51:12,945 --> 00:51:14,947
How are you?

696
00:51:19,452 --> 00:51:22,080
Don't let the elegant suit fool you.

697
00:51:23,456 --> 00:51:26,793
This guy's a real son of a bitch.

698
00:51:26,918 --> 00:51:28,252
Seriously.

699
00:51:29,295 --> 00:51:32,090
In fact, he's one of our best men.

700
00:51:32,215 --> 00:51:33,591
You see?

701
00:51:36,094 --> 00:51:37,929
Enjoy it.

702
00:51:39,555 --> 00:51:41,307
Ma'am.

703
00:51:53,236 --> 00:51:56,906
Where do you know him from?
Is he a friend of yours?

704
00:51:57,031 --> 00:51:59,367
You know Cali is a very small city.

705
00:52:00,243 --> 00:52:03,871
Even more so
when one is in the security business.

706
00:52:04,455 --> 00:52:06,916
One must deal with all sorts of people.

707
00:52:13,047 --> 00:52:15,508
Is that the paperwork
I'm supposed to deliver?

708
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,427
These documents are very sensitive.

709
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:22,515
And I don't feel comfortable
transferring possession to anyone else.

710
00:52:23,766 --> 00:52:26,018
All right. Let's go, then.

711
00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:34,902
Open the door, Cordova.

712
00:52:35,027 --> 00:52:39,282
Go fuck yourself, Pallomari!
In the front seat.

713
00:52:39,407 --> 00:52:42,034
What the fuck's wrong with you?
Open the door. Fuck your mother.

714
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,620
In the front.
I'm not your fucking employee.

715
00:52:50,418 --> 00:52:53,129
Making friends everywhere he goes.

716
00:52:53,254 --> 00:52:54,714
No shit.

717
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:15,943
Look at this fucking neighbourhood.

718
00:53:16,068 --> 00:53:18,487
This guy's doing more than filing W-9s.

719
00:53:19,363 --> 00:53:21,073
<i>Es el cabrón.</i>

720
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:23,618
The fucking man.

721
00:53:43,137 --> 00:53:46,265
I haven't been able to reach
an agreement yet. He's very stubborn.

722
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:49,101
'Listen to me, Pacho.
We have to seal the deal.

723
00:53:49,227 --> 00:53:51,270
'It's very important.'

724
00:53:51,395 --> 00:53:55,775
Amado has to go to Juárez tomorrow.
I'll go with him and close the deal.

725
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:59,820
'All right. Keep me informed.
Good night.'

726
00:53:59,946 --> 00:54:01,614
Good night, Gilberto.

727
00:54:16,337 --> 00:54:18,172

It's been a long time
since anyone asked me on a date.

742
00:54:58,713 --> 00:55:00,589
Come in, please.

743
00:55:05,428 --> 00:55:07,013
Take a seat.

744
00:55:07,138 --> 00:55:11,642
Sir... your offer of this apartment
is very generous.

745
00:55:13,686 --> 00:55:15,187
But?

746
00:55:15,313 --> 00:55:19,191
But... I would like to know the terms.

747
00:55:21,736 --> 00:55:23,362
The terms?

748
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:25,823
How often will you come here
to visit me?

749
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:30,536
As often as you like.

750
00:55:31,329 --> 00:55:33,497
Or never.

751
00:55:33,622 --> 00:55:35,499
This is your home.

752
00:55:35,624 --> 00:55:37,585
Is there a monthly stipend?

753
00:55:38,878 --> 00:55:40,421
A stipend?

754
00:55:40,546 --> 00:55:45,051
Mr. Rodríguez, I married Claudio Salazar
when I was 18 years old.

755
00:55:45,176 --> 00:55:47,053
I knew nothing.

756
00:55:47,178 --> 00:55:51,682
Now I need to get away from his family,
and I need my son back.

757
00:55:52,725 --> 00:55:55,227
If you could help me with that...

758
00:55:57,313 --> 00:55:58,814
I can.

759
00:56:01,025 --> 00:56:02,568
Then I accept.

760
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:10,242
It's great to hear that.

761
00:56:22,296 --> 00:56:27,510
Why don't you get some rest,
have something to eat?

762
00:56:27,635 --> 00:56:30,513
Tomorrow morning,
I'll send for your son.

763
00:56:32,181 --> 00:56:33,933
How does that sound?

764
00:56:35,017 --> 00:56:36,435
Good.

765
00:56:37,269 --> 00:56:38,729
Take a seat.

766
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:45,194
Fifty miles an hour,
you could jump into water and survive.

767
00:56:45,319 --> 00:56:48,572
- You can't leave her on the bus.
- I guess you do. You leave her on the bus.

768
00:56:48,697 --> 00:56:50,282
No.

769
00:56:51,784 --> 00:56:54,537
- I would leave her.
- You would leave her?

770
00:56:56,247 --> 00:56:57,540
All right. Here we go.

771
00:57:09,510 --> 00:57:10,970
Dan...

772
00:57:11,095 --> 00:57:13,055
Is that who I think it is?

773
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,809
