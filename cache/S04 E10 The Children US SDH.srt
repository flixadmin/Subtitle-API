<i>( theme music playing )</i>

2
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,803
( cawing )

3
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:59,345
<i>( dog barking )</i>

4
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:21,242
You're wearing
a black cloak again.

5
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:24,162
I've been sent
to negotiate with you.

6
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:55,652
It appears my trusting
nature got the better of me.

7
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,820
It's happened before.

8
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:01,741
I was hoping your loyalty
was real when you pledged
yourself to us, Jon Snow.

9
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:03,368
Truly I was.

10
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:05,119
The Halfhand ordered me
to join your army

11
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:08,122
and bring back whatever
information I could
to Castle Black.

12
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:10,750
He made me kill him
so you'd trust me.

13
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,210
I was loyal...

14
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:15,004
to him and to my
Night's Watch vows.

15
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,881
All your vows?

16
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:22,428
She wasn't enough
to turn you, eh?

17
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,889
Were you enough
to turn her?

18
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:27,475
She put three
arrows in me

19
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:29,519
when I escaped.

20
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,398
Did you see her
again at Castle Black?

21
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:36,651
- Yes.
- And?

22
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:38,569
She's dead.

23
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:43,116
- Your doing?
- No.

24
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:46,869
We'll drink to her.

25
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:12,270
Of all the ways
I'd kill you,

26
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:14,439
poison would be
the last.

27
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:20,069
- Ygritte.
- Ygritte.

28
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:27,410
( coughs )

29
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,705
That's not wine.

30
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:33,875
No, it's a proper
northern drink, Jon Snow.

31
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:37,086
You did well.
Fought hard.

32
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,088
Killed some of
our strongest men.

33
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,966
One of our giants
went into your tunnel

34
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,135
and never
came out again.

35
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:46,262
Mag the Mighty.

36
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,139
He's dead.

37
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:50,141
He killed
my friend Grenn.

38
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:51,684
He was their king.

39
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:54,228
The last of a bloodline
that stretches back

40
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,272
before the First Men.

41
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:58,357
Grenn came from a farm.

42
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:05,531
- Mag and Grenn.
- Grenn and Mag.

43
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:10,828
Kullback, could I trouble
you for something to eat?

44
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:13,915
I don't imagine our guest
has eaten anything

45
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:15,500
for quite some time.

46
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:21,005
So, you're here
to strike a bargain?

47
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:24,759
Turn your army around
and go home.

48
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:26,594
You know I know
you're low on arrows,

49
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:29,055
you're low on oil,
you're low on men.

50
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:31,099
How many are left, 50?

51
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:33,059
I told Tormund and Orell.

52
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:34,769
We have more
than 1,000 men.

53
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:36,646
I showed you
everything I had.

54
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,606
The whole army,
100,000 strong.

55
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:41,692
And what did you do?
You fired on us with
everything you had.

56
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:44,195
It wasn't much.
As soon as I saw that,

57
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:48,282
I sent 400 men
to climb the Wall,

58
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,159
an unmanned stretch
five miles west of here.

59
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,994
A lot of them
will die climbing,

60
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,205
but most of them will be
over by the end of the day.

61
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:57,291
<i>It's me being honest</i>
<i>with you, Jon Snow,</i>

62
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,961
<i>which is more than</i>
<i>you've ever done for me.</i>

63
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:01,796
My people
have bled enough.

64
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:03,631
We're not here
to conquer.

65
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:06,634
We're here to hide
behind your Wall.

66
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:10,888
Just like you.
We need your tunnel.

67
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,975
Now we both know
that winter is coming.

68
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:17,812
And if my people
aren't south of the Wall
when it comes in earnest,

69
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,814
we'll all end up
worse than dead.

70
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:22,775
You want to strike
a bargain with me?

71
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,152
Here's the bargain.

72
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,571
You go back,
you open the gates to us,

73
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:30,158
and I swear to you
that no one else will die.

74
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,243
Refuse,

75
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:35,204
and we'll kill every
last man at Castle Black.

76
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:38,583
Ah!

77
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:45,631
Oh, that's why
you're here.

78
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:49,385
I reckon you could
do it before any of
them could stop you.

79
00:07:49,468 --> 00:07:51,137
They'd kill you,
of course.

80
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,680
They'd kill you slow.

81
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:56,726
But you knew that
when you came in here.

82
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:59,854
Are you capable
of that, Jon Snow?

83
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:04,025
Killing a man in his
own tent when he's just
offered you peace?

84
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:06,027
Is that what
the Night's Watch is?

85
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,487
Is that what you are?

86
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:14,827
-<i> ( horn blows )</i>
<i>- Man: Riders coming!</i>

87
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,370
- Are you attacking us?
- No.

88
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,247
It's like you said,
we don't have the men.

89
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:21,125
-<i> ( horn blowing )</i>
<i>- ( dogs barking )</i>

90
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,423
( men shouting )

91
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:34,263
( horse whinnies )

92
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:48,361
Hold! To me!
To me!

93
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:03,584
( men shouting )

94
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:02,560
Stand down!

95
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,397
I said my people
have bled enough

96
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,899
and I meant it.

97
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:39,096
( shouting )

98
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,852
Man:
<i>Round them up.</i>

99
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:46,520
<i>Stay with the horses.</i>

100
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,407
You're the
King-beyond-the-Wall?

101
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:03,704
- Do you know who I am?
- Never had the pleasure.

102
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:05,039
This is Stannis Baratheon,

103
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:07,166
the one true king
of the Seven Kingdoms.

104
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:10,544
We're not in the Seven
Kingdoms and you're not
dressed for this weather.

105
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:14,423
It is customary to kneel
when surrendering to a king.

106
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:22,640
We do not kneel.

107
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:24,725
I'll have thousands
of your men in chains
by nightfall,

108
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:27,395
have nowhere to put them,
have nothing to feed them.

109
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:30,398
I'm not here
to slaughter beat dogs.

110
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:33,776
Their fate
depends on their king.

111
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:37,571
All the same,
we do not kneel.

112
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,868
Take these men away.

113
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:47,248
What's a man
of the Night's Watch
doing in a wildling camp?

114
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:50,584
I was sent to
discuss terms with the
King-beyond-the-Wall.

115
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,169
You're speaking
to the one true king, boy.

116
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:54,755
You will address him
as Your Grace.

117
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,092
I know he's the king.
My father died for him.

118
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:03,097
My name is Jon Snow,
Your Grace.

119
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,141
I'm Ned Stark's son.

120
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:10,271
Your father
was an honorable man.

121
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:12,106
He was, Your Grace.

122
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:14,275
What do you think
he'd have done with him?

123
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:22,366
I was this man's
prisoner once.

124
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,536
He could have tortured me.
He could have killed me.

125
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:29,290
<i>But he spared my life.</i>

126
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:31,459
I think my father would
have taken him prisoner,

127
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,669
listened to what
he had to say.

128
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:39,383
Very well, then.
Take him.

129
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:47,892
Your Grace.

130
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:50,519
<i>If my father had seen</i>
<i>the things that I've seen,</i>

131
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,898
he'd also tell you
to burn the dead
before nightfall.

132
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,942
All of them.

133
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:05,701
<i>( flies buzzing )</i>

134
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:08,245
I would suggest
milk of the poppy

135
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,498
to ease his pain,
but he is completely
insensate.

136
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,249
Bloody Martells.

137
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,293
The cause appears
to be manticore venom.

138
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:16,795
It is.
The Death's Head
manticore.

139
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:20,341
Yes, I've read
a great deal about it.

140
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:22,301
It's a horrible poison.

141
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:25,346
Usually Mantari
in origin.

142
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,139
Oh! Yes, yes.

143
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,724
There's nothing
to be done.

144
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:30,059
Yes, there is.

145
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,605
May I ask what you
think you're doing?

146
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:35,898
Saving him.

147
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,900
Your Grace, I wish
it were otherwise,

148
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,402
but Ser Gregor
is beyond saving.

149
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,863
Well, well beyond.

150
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,533
This man is not
even a maester,

151
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:47,201
let alone Grand Maester.

152
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:49,078
That's for the best.

153
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,538
No maester knows
how to save him.

154
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,706
That is exactly
the sort of arrogance

155
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,751
that had him expelled from
the Citadel, Your Grace.

156
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:59,380
His curiosity was deemed
dangerous and unnatural.

157
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:01,882
Rightly so,
in my opinion.

158
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:04,385
You're dismissed,
Grand Maester.

159
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:09,848
But, Your Grace,
this is my laboratory.

160
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,518
- Not anymore.
- Pycelle:<i> But I--</i>

161
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,855
( scoffs )

162
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:19,567
<i>( door opens )</i>

163
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,403
- You can save him?
- Difficult to say,
Your Grace.

164
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:25,030
<i>But if my past work</i>
<i>is any guide...</i>

165
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,824
<i>( door slams )</i>

166
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:28,659
...we stand a chance.

167
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:31,120
Do everything you can.

168
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,788
Come to me
for anything you need.

169
00:14:32,871 --> 00:14:34,582
Thank you,
Your Grace.

170
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,292
<i>You should know,</i>

171
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:40,296
the process
may change him...

172
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,548
somewhat.

173
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,635
Will it weaken him?

174
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,471
Oh, no.

175
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,599
Very well, then.

176
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,827
Tywin:
<i>Not another word.</i>

177
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:14,455
We've been over this.
The matter's closed.

178
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:17,458
I'm opening it again.

179
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:20,461
You were betrothed
to Loras Tyrell.

180
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:23,130
You're still betrothed
to Loras Tyrell.

181
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:25,257
And you will marry
Loras Tyrell

182
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,801
as soon as Tommen
marries Margaery.

183
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,011
I will not.

184
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:32,014
Jaime cannot marry
or inherit lands.

185
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:35,142
Tyrion's sentence
will be carried out
tomorrow.

186
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:40,397
You have on
several occasions
made great claims

187
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:43,192
about your commitment
to this family's future.

188
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,985
Your role in that future

189
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,112
is more vital now
than it ever was.

190
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,989
I don't care.

191
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:52,493
I will stay in King's
Landing where I belong
with my son the king.

192
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:55,746
When you were nine years old,
I was called to the capital.

193
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:58,540
I decided to take
your brother with me
and not you.

194
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:02,169
You insisted
that you would not be
left at Casterly Rock

195
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:04,838
under any circumstances.
And if you recall--

196
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:07,216
I'm not interested
in hearing another one
of your smug stories

197
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,385
about the time you won.

198
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,345
This isn't going to be
one of those times.

199
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:13,430
Do you think
you'll be the first person

200
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:16,475
dragged into a sept to be
married against her will?

201
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:18,435
When you marched into
the throne room to tell me

202
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:21,230
we'd won the Battle
of Blackwater--
do you remember?

203
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:26,068
I was sitting on the Iron
Throne with Tommen.

204
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,861
I was about to give him
essence of nightshade.

205
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,780
That's how far
I was willing to go
when I thought

206
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:32,825
someone awful had come
to take my son away.

207
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:37,079
Someone awful is coming
to take him away.

208
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,248
- No.
- Joffrey is dead.

209
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,583
Myrcella's been sold
like livestock.

210
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,878
And now you want to
ship me off to Highgarden
and steal my boy.

211
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:47,172
My last boy.

212
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,091
Margaery will dig
her claws in,

213
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,468
you will dig your claws in
and you'll fight over him

214
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,846
like beasts
until you rip him apart.

215
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:57,474
I will burn our house
to the ground before
I let that happen.

216
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:00,769
And how will you do that?

217
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,731
I'll tell
everyone the truth.

218
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,858
<i>What truth</i>
<i>would that be?</i>

219
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,072
You don't know, do you?

220
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,452
You never believed it.

221
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:20,748
How is that possible?

222
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:23,709
What am I saying?
Of course it's possible.

223
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:27,504
How can someone so consumed
by the idea of his family

224
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:31,925
have any conception
what his actual family
was doing?

225
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,970
We were right there
in front of you and you
didn't see us.

226
00:17:35,053 --> 00:17:37,181
One look
in the past 20 years,

227
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:40,225
one real look at
your own children
and you would have known.

228
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,728
Known what?

229
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:44,980
Everything they say
is true.

230
00:17:45,063 --> 00:17:46,690
- About Jaime and me.
- No.

231
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:49,443
- Your legacy is a lie.
- No, no, no, no.

232
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:52,446
I don't believe you.

233
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,826
Yes, you do.

234
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:17,596
Jaime.

235
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,723
You won.

236
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:22,476
One fewer brother.
Must be proud of yourself.

237
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,853
There's really nothing
you wouldn't do, is there?

238
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,688
For my family,
no, nothing.

239
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,982
I would do things
for my family you
couldn't imagine.

240
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:31,610
- Tyrion is your family.
- He's not.

241
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:34,404
- You don't get to choose.
- I do. So do you.

242
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:37,783
You can choose the creature
that killed our mother
to come into this world--

243
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:40,202
Are you really mad enough
to blame him for that?

244
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,830
<i>He didn't</i>
<i>decide to kill her.</i>
<i>He was an infant.</i>

245
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:44,832
A disease doesn't decide
to kill you.

246
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:47,584
All the same,
you cut it out
before it does.

247
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,796
What do you decide?
What do you choose?

248
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:52,256
The things I did
to get back to you,

249
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:55,175
to endure all that,
only to find you--

250
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,055
I choose you.

251
00:19:00,138 --> 00:19:01,849
- Those are words.
- Yes.

252
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:04,101
Like the ones
I just said to Father.

253
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,020
I told him.

254
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,856
Told him what?

255
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:10,774
I told him about us.

256
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,193
You told him?

257
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,612
I told him I won't
marry Loras Tyrell.

258
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:19,199
I told him I'm staying
right here with Tommen,
with you.

259
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:20,826
You think he'll
just accept that?

260
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:22,786
Go and ask him.

261
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,707
What did you say?

262
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,084
I don't want to talk
about Tywin Lannister.

263
00:19:29,167 --> 00:19:31,628
I don't choose
Tywin Lannister.

264
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,255
I don't love
Tywin Lannister.

265
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,799
I love my brother.

266
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:38,677
I love my lover.

267
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,054
People will whisper,
they'll make their jokes.

268
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,556
Let them.

269
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:45,058
They're all so small,
I can't even see them.

270
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:47,477
I only see what matters.

271
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,863
Someone will walk in.

272
00:19:57,946 --> 00:19:59,364
I don't care.

273
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,209
( Missandei speaking
Valyrian )

274
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,851
( speaking Valyrian )

275
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:39,196
I can speak the common
tongue if you wish.

276
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,906
You speak it very well.

277
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:44,785
Before you freed me,
I belonged to
Master Mighdal.

278
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:46,828
I was tutor
to his children.

279
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,872
<i>I taught them languages</i>
<i>and history.</i>

280
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:53,043
They know a great deal
about your family
because of me.

281
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:55,462
<i>Little Calla</i>
<i>is only seven,</i>

282
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:58,507
but she admires you
very much.

283
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,134
I hope I can prove
worthy of her admiration.

284
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:04,763
What can I do for you?

285
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:07,391
When you took the city,
the children begged me

286
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:10,018
not to leave the house.

287
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:13,981
But Master Mighdal
and I agreed that I must.

288
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:16,566
So I lost my home.

289
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:20,696
Now I live on the streets.

290
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,322
I have outfitted mess halls

291
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,783
to feed all former slaves
and barracks to shelter them.

292
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:27,202
I do not mean
to offend, Your Grace.

293
00:21:27,285 --> 00:21:30,497
<i>I went to one</i>
<i>of these places.</i>

294
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,708
The young prey on the old.

295
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:36,169
Take what they want
and beat us if we resist.

296
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,463
My Unsullied will make them
safe again in short order,

297
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,340
my friend,
this I promise you.

298
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:44,261
Even if they are safe,
who would I be there?

299
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:47,055
What purpose
would I serve?

300
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,392
<i>With my master,</i>
<i>I was a teacher.</i>

301
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:54,271
I had the respect
and love of his children.

302
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:56,189
What is it
that you want from me?

303
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:59,192
Your Grace, I ask you

304
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:02,362
to let me sell myself
back to Master Mighdal.

305
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:05,073
You want to return
to a man who owned you

306
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,534
like a goat
or a chair?

307
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:09,202
Please, Your Grace.

308
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:12,205
The young may rejoice
in the new world you
have built for them,

309
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:15,333
but for those of us
too old to change,

310
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:20,088
there is only fear
and squalor.

311
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,215
I am not alone.

312
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:25,677
There are many
outside waiting to beg
the same of you.

313
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,804
I did not take
this city to preside

314
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:30,348
over the injustice
I fought to destroy.

315
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:34,061
I took it to bring
people freedom.

316
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:37,606
But freedom means making
your own choices.

317
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:41,526
I will allow you
to sign a contract with
your former master.

318
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:45,113
It may not cover a period
lasting longer than a year.

319
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,407
Thank you, Your Grace.

320
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:50,911
Thank you.

321
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,585
The masters
will take advantage
of this situation.

322
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,089
The men serving them

323
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:04,841
will be slaves
in all but name.

324
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:14,017
Approach, my friend.

325
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:21,858
( speaking Low Valyrian )

326
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,531
( speaking Low Valyrian )

327
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,455
( sobbing )

328
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:37,833
( speaking low Valyrian )

329
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,001
Missandei:
<i>I have brought you--</i>

330
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,091
He came from the sky.

331
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:50,095
<i>The black one.</i>

332
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,559
The winged shadow.

333
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,437
<i>He came from</i>
<i>the sky and...</i>

334
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:07,112
<i>My girl.</i>

335
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:08,822
My little girl.

336
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:11,324
( sobbing )

337
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:15,162
Daenerys:
<i>What was her name?</i>

338
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:16,997
Missandei:
<i>Zala, Your Grace.</i>

339
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,250
- How old was she?
- Three.

340
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:22,502
Three.

341
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:27,340
( speaking Valyrian )

342
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:32,095
( Grey Worm speaking
Valyrian )

343
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:41,813
( speaking Valyrian )

344
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:50,572
( screeching )

345
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,826
( roaring )

346
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:45,395

347
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:00,368
( screeching )

00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:07,334
( screeching )

349
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:15,008
Aemon:
<i>They came to us from White</i>
<i>Harbor and Barrowton,</i>

350
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:18,845
from Fairmarket
and King's Landing,

351
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:21,181
from north and south,

352
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:24,351
from east and west.

353
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:28,897
They died protecting
men, women, and children

354
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,608
who will never know
their names.

355
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:34,152
<i>It is for us</i>
<i>to remember them.</i>

356
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:35,695
<i>Our brothers,</i>

357
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:38,865
<i>we shall never see</i>
<i>their like again.</i>

358
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:42,202
All:
And now their watch
is ended.

359
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:47,665
Aemon:
And now their watch
is ended.

360
00:28:57,861 --> 00:29:01,197
Your old blind man
patched me up.

361
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:02,574
<i>Why?</i>

362
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:05,952
He's sworn to treat all
wounded men, friend or foe.

363
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:08,204
You want me alive
so you can torture me?

364
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:09,622
No one's gonna torture you.

365
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:13,501
So how do we die?
Hanging? Beheading?

366
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,503
<i>Drop us from the top</i>
<i>of the Wall?</i>

367
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,755
I don't know what happens
to the prisoners.

368
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,632
Who decides?

369
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:22,260
I suppose Stannis does.

370
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:24,512
He your king now?

371
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,640
I don't have a king.

372
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:32,228
You spent too much
time with us, Jon Snow.

373
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:34,481
You can never be
a kneeler again.

374
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:37,817
We're gonna burn
the bodies of your dead.

375
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:40,695
Do you want to say
any words over them?

376
00:29:40,778 --> 00:29:43,615
Words?
What kind of words?

377
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:46,993
Funeral words.
I don't know how
the free folk do it.

378
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:48,453
<i>Do what?</i>

379
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:50,413
Say farewell.

380
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:53,958
The dead can't
hear us, boy.

381
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:00,465
Snow.

382
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:06,638
Did you love her?

383
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:11,976
She loved you.

384
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,937
She told you?

385
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,146
<i>No.</i>

386
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:18,358
All she ever talked about
was killing you.

387
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:20,527
<i>That's how I know.</i>

388
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:26,533
She belongs
in the North.

389
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:28,660
<i>The real North.</i>

390
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:32,497
You understand me?

391
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:55,538
<i>( wind howling )</i>

392
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,887
( groaning )

393
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:18,978
We can stop.
We can rest.

394
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:21,105
We'll rest with
the three-eyed raven.

395
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:34,077
We're not
going to make it.

396
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:40,166
We're already here.

397
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:42,877
Bran:
<i>Jojen.</i>

398
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,004
<i>Jojen.</i>

399
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:47,256
Look, Jojen.
Look.

400
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:51,594
( groaning )

401
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:11,215
Jojen!
Come on!

402
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:13,593
Help them!
Now!

403
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:15,178
Meera:
<i>Hold on to me!</i>

404
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:22,310
Hang on!

405
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,520
- Hodor.
- Help them!

406
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:26,355
Hodor.

407
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:32,528
- ( growling )
- Hodor!

408
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,533
( screeching )

409
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,538
( grunts )

410
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:48,878
Hodor!

411
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,731
( growling )

412
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:12,652
Hodor.
( whimpering )

413
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:14,403
Hodor!

414
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:47,937
Jojen:
<i>Bran!</i>

415
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:53,276
Save yourself, now!

416
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:04,203
( grunting )

417
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:07,957
( shouts )

418
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:20,136
Girl:
<i>Come with me,</i>
<i>Brandon Stark.</i>

419
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:27,226
( gasping )

420
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,729
He is lost.

421
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:31,814
Come with me
or die with him.

422
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:34,483
Go with them.

423
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:48,331
<i>( ice bursting )</i>

424
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:53,419
<i>( slices )</i>

425
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:55,296
( growling )

426
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,465
<i>They cannot follow us.</i>

427
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:41,884
The power that moves them
is powerless here.

428
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:44,178
Who are you?

429
00:37:44,261 --> 00:37:46,555
The First Men
called us the children,

430
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:49,725
but we were born
long before them.

431
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:52,228
Come, he waits for you.

432
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:21,424
<i>( crow caws )</i>

433
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,301
( caws )

434
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:19,273
You're the three-eyed raven?

435
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:25,571
I've been many things.

436
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:30,326
Now I am what you see.

437
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:34,205
My brother,
he led us to you
and now he--

438
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:36,165
He knew
what would happen.

439
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:39,627
From the moment
he left,

440
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:42,088
he knew
and he went anyway.

441
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:43,839
How do you know?

442
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:45,883
I've been watching you.

443
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:48,135
All of you.

444
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,096
All of your lives.

445
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:52,932
With 1,000 eyes
and one.

446
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:57,603
<i>Now you've come</i>
<i>to me at last,</i>

447
00:39:57,686 --> 00:40:00,189
Brandon Stark.

448
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:02,650
Though the hour is late.

449
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:05,736
I didn't want
anyone to die for me.

450
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:09,323
He died so you could find
what you have lost.

451
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:12,868
You're going to help
me walk again?

452
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,455
<i>You will never</i>
<i>walk again.</i>

453
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:21,210
But you will fly.

454
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:32,513
<i>( bird squawks )</i>

455
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,978
Podrick.

456
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:41,272
Podrick.

457
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:43,315
Where are the horses?

458
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,068
I hobbled them
last night.

459
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:48,028
What sort of hobble?

460
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,738
A figure eight
like you taught me.

461
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:52,116
If you did it
like I taught you,

462
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:53,492
then the horses
would be here.

463
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:55,077
Thieves, maybe?

464
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:57,621
It's at least 30 miles
to the Eyrie from here.

465
00:40:57,705 --> 00:41:00,166
You're carrying
the saddlebags.

466
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:15,139
<i>( grunting )</i>

467
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:29,612
People coming.

468
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:34,200
You can shit later.
There's people coming.

469
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:38,078
Morning.

470
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:41,916
Morning.

471
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:45,211
I like your sword.

472
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:48,380
<i>Are we getting close</i>
<i>to the Bloody Gate?</i>

473
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:50,341
About 10 more miles.

474
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:52,134
Did you
hear that, Podrick?

475
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:54,553
Only 10 more miles
to the Bloody Gate.

476
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:58,140
Are you a knight?

477
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:00,100
No.

478
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:02,394
But you know how
to use that sword?

479
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:05,064
I do.

480
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:07,149
Does it have a name?

481
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:09,485
Oathkeeper.

482
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:11,362
Mine's Needle.

483
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:13,322
Good name.

484
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:17,284
Who taught you
how to fight?

485
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:20,079
My father.

486
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:23,165
Mine never wanted to.

487
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:27,169
Said fighting
was for boys.

488
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:29,255
Mine said the same.

489
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:31,507
But I kept fighting
the boys anyway.

490
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:33,384
<i>Kept losing.</i>

491
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:36,095
Finally my father said,
"If you're going to do it,

492
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:38,055
you might as well
do it right."

493
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:43,435
Seven blessings.

494
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:46,188
I'm Brienne of Tarth.
This is Podrick Payne.

495
00:42:48,565 --> 00:42:50,484
You want something?

496
00:42:50,567 --> 00:42:53,529
That's Sandor Clegane.
The Hound.

497
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:06,959
You're Arya Stark.

498
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:10,129
I asked if you
wanted something.

499
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:12,756
I swore to your mother
I would bring you
home to her.

500
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:15,175
My mother's dead.

501
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:16,802
<i>I know.</i>

502
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:20,055
I wish I could have
been there to protect her.

503
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:22,683
You're not a northerner.

504
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:26,687
No, but I swore a sacred
vow to protect her.

505
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,647
Why didn't you?

506
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:35,362
She commanded me
to bring Jaime Lannister
back to King's Landing.

507
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,156
You're paid
by the Lannisters.

508
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:39,825
<i>You're here</i>
<i>for the bounty on me.</i>

509
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:42,661
I'm not paid
by the Lannisters.

510
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:44,413
No?

511
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:47,666
Fancy sword
you've got there.

512
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,418
Where'd you get it?

513
00:43:52,087 --> 00:43:54,840
I've been looking
at Lannister gold
all my life.

514
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:59,011
Go on, Brienne
of fucking Tarth.

515
00:43:59,094 --> 00:44:01,430
Tell me that's not
Lannister gold.

516
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:05,684
Jaime Lannister
gave me this sword.

517
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:07,519
The Bloody Gate
is 10 miles.

518
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:09,396
I swore to your mother
by the old gods--

519
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,856
I don't care
what you swore.

520
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:12,441
- Arya!
- Hound:<i> You heard the girl.</i>

521
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:15,444
- She's not coming with you.
- She is.

522
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,864
You're not
a good listener.

523
00:44:18,947 --> 00:44:21,283
That Valyrian steel?

524
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:23,577
I always wanted
some Valyrian steel.

525
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:26,413
Come with me, Arya.
I'll take you to safety.

526
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,874
Safety?
Where the fuck's that?

527
00:44:28,957 --> 00:44:31,335
Her aunt
in the Eyrie is dead.
Her mother's dead.

528
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:33,379
Her father's dead.
Her brother's dead.

529
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:35,798
Winterfell is a pile
of rubble.

530
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:38,133
There is no safety,
you dumb bitch.

531
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:41,053
You don't know
that by now,

532
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:43,680
you're the wrong one
to watch over her.

533
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:45,557
And that's what
you're doing?

534
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:47,810
Watching over her?

535
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:50,854
Aye, that's what
I'm doing.

536
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,496
( grunts )

537
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,460
( panting )

538
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:35,816
( grunts )

539
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:01,008
I have no wish
to kill you, Ser.

540
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:16,106
I'm not a knight.

541
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,983
( grunts )

542
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:21,403
( groans )

543
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:28,160
( screams )

544
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:39,171
( screaming )

545
00:46:39,254 --> 00:46:41,798
( groans )

546
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:09,493
( shouting )

547
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:19,169
( panting )

548
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:35,269
Arya!

549
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:37,563
Arya!

550
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:41,775
Arya!

551
00:47:41,858 --> 00:47:43,819
- Where is she?
- Podrick:<i> She was just here.</i>

552
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:45,654
Why weren't you
watching her?

553
00:47:45,737 --> 00:47:47,239
I was watching you.
I thought you might
need some help.

554
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:49,491
Which way, Pod?
Which way did she go?

555
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:51,368
I think that way.

556
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:53,328
Brienne:
<i>Arya!</i>

557
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:55,497
<i>Arya!</i>

558
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:20,522
( panting )

559
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:26,278
You still here?

560
00:48:28,363 --> 00:48:30,073
( coughs )

561
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:38,290
Big bitch saved you.

562
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:40,375
I don't need saving.

563
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:43,211
No, not you.
You're a real killer.

564
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:45,297
With your water dancing

565
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:47,424
and your Needle.

566
00:48:48,925 --> 00:48:50,636
You gonna die?

567
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:53,472
Unless there's a maester
hiding behind that rock,

568
00:48:53,555 --> 00:48:55,849
aye,

569
00:48:55,932 --> 00:48:57,934
I'm done.

570
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:04,775
I'd skin you alive
for wine.

571
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:07,486
Fuck water.

572
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:11,156
Killed by a woman.

573
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:13,033
( chuckles )

574
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:15,786
I bet you like that.

575
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:19,081
Go on,

576
00:49:19,164 --> 00:49:21,333
go after her.

577
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:23,752
<i>She'll help you.</i>

578
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:29,049
Going it alone,

579
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:31,885
<i>you won't last</i>
<i>a day out there.</i>

580
00:49:31,968 --> 00:49:34,763
I'll last
longer than you.

581
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:43,939
You remember where
the heart is?

582
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:52,906
Fuck it.

583
00:49:52,989 --> 00:49:54,908
I'm ready.

584
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,287
Go on, girl.

585
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:01,540
Another name
off your list.

586
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:05,085
You kept
promising me.

587
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:13,760
I cut down
your butcher's boy.

588
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,804
The ginger.

589
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:19,349
He was begging
for mercy.

590
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:22,769
"Please, Ser.
Please don't kill me.

591
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:24,479
Please, please."

592
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:28,775
<i>Bled all over</i>
<i>my horse.</i>

593
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:31,820
<i>Saddle stunk</i>
<i>of butcher's boy</i>
<i>for weeks.</i>

594
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:36,324
And your sister.

595
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:39,494
Your pretty sister.

596
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:43,415
<i>I should have taken her.</i>

597
00:50:43,498 --> 00:50:46,334
That night
the Blackwater burned.

598
00:50:47,919 --> 00:50:51,298
I should have
fucked her bloody.

599
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:54,134
<i>At least I'd have</i>
<i>one happy memory.</i>

600
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:06,229
Do I have to beg you?

601
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:12,861
Do it.

602
00:51:17,365 --> 00:51:19,493
Do it.

603
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:24,539
Do it.

604
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:56,404
Kill me.

605
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:02,077
Kill me!

606
00:52:03,411 --> 00:52:05,956
Kill me!

607
00:52:07,415 --> 00:52:08,708
Kill me!

608
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:11,127
<i>( door opens )</i>

609

<i>( footsteps )</i>

611
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:21,638
Oh, get on with it,
you son of a whore.

612
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:24,182
Is that any way to speak
about our mother?

613
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:25,851
What are you doing?

614
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:27,477
What do you
think I'm doing?

615
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:29,354
A galley's waiting
in the bay bound for
the Free Cities.

616
00:52:29,437 --> 00:52:31,106
- Who's helping you?
- Varys.

617
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:33,108
- Varys?
- You have more friends
than you thought.

618
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:46,663
There's a locked door
at the top of the stairs.

619
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:49,207
Knock on it twice,
then twice again.

620
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:52,085
Varys will open.

621
00:52:52,168 --> 00:52:55,046
I suppose this
is good-bye, then.

622
00:53:10,186 --> 00:53:12,230
Farewell, little brother.

623
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:16,943
Jaime.

624
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:19,946
Thank you for my life.

625
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:25,368
Quickly now.

626
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:46,074
Tywin?

627
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:50,954
My lion.

628
00:55:03,508 --> 00:55:05,427
( grunting )

629
00:55:24,195 --> 00:55:26,489
( choking )

630
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:29,826
( grunts )

631
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:32,537
( gasping )

632
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:40,462
( whimpers )

633
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:11,493
I'm sorry.

634
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:24,130
( exhales )

635
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:26,091
I'm sorry.

636
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:40,855
<i>( crossbow lever dragging )</i>

637
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:10,093
( door creaks )

638
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:14,848
Tyrion.

639
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:17,809
Put down the crossbow.

640
00:57:21,354 --> 00:57:23,523
Who released you?

641
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:26,109
Your brother,
I expect.

642
00:57:26,192 --> 00:57:29,445
He always had
a soft spot for you.

643
00:57:29,529 --> 00:57:32,282
Come, we'll go and talk
in my chambers.

644
00:57:36,744 --> 00:57:39,664
This is how you want
to speak to me, hmm?

645
00:57:39,747 --> 00:57:42,125
<i>Shaming your father has</i>
<i>always given you pleasure.</i>

646
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:44,043
All my life

647
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:46,588
you've wanted me dead.

648
00:57:48,256 --> 00:57:50,341
Yes.

649
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:53,052
<i>But you refused to die.</i>

650
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:54,888
I respect that.

651
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:56,681
Even admire it.

652
00:57:56,764 --> 00:57:58,808
<i>You fight</i>
<i>for what's yours.</i>

653
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:01,019
I'd never let them
execute you.

654
00:58:01,102 --> 00:58:02,562
Is that what you fear?

655
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:05,523
<i>I'll never let Ilyn Payne</i>
<i>take your head.</i>

656
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:07,483
You're a Lannister.

657
00:58:09,402 --> 00:58:12,530
You're my son.

658
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:15,742
I loved her.

659
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:17,785
Who?

660
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:20,205
Shae.

661
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:23,374
Oh, Tyrion.

662
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:25,877
- Put down that crossbow.
- I murdered her.

663
00:58:27,712 --> 00:58:30,215
With my own hands.

664
00:58:33,426 --> 00:58:36,721
- It doesn't matter.
- Doesn't matter?

665
00:58:36,804 --> 00:58:39,307
She was a whore.

666
00:58:40,558 --> 00:58:42,435
- Say that word again...
-<i> And what?</i>

667
00:58:42,518 --> 00:58:44,979
You'll kill your own
father in the privy?

668
00:58:46,272 --> 00:58:48,149
No.

669
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:50,360
You're my son.

670
00:58:50,443 --> 00:58:52,237
Now, enough
of this nonsense.

671
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:55,657
I am your son and you
sentenced me to die.

672
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:59,035
You knew I didn't
poison Joffrey,

673
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:02,538
but you sentenced me
all the same.

674
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:05,041
- Why?
- Enough.

675
00:59:05,124 --> 00:59:06,626
<i>We'll go back</i>
<i>to my chambers</i>

676
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:08,044
and speak
with some dignity.

677
00:59:08,127 --> 00:59:10,922
I can't go back there.
She's in there.

678
00:59:11,005 --> 00:59:13,675
You're afraid
of a dead whore?

679
00:59:13,758 --> 00:59:16,177
( groans )

680
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:26,771
You shot me.

681
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:34,070
( groans )

682
00:59:35,446 --> 00:59:38,032
You're no son of mine.

683
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:40,410
I am your son.

684
00:59:40,493 --> 00:59:43,997
I have always
been your son.

685
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,873
( groans )

686
00:59:57,927 --> 01:00:00,221
What have you done?

687
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:03,433
Quickly.

688
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:09,480
Trust me, my friend.
I brought you this far.

689
01:00:40,178 --> 01:00:42,680
<i>( bells tolling )</i>

690
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:06,097
I want to see
the captain.

691
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:07,932
You're seeing him.

692
01:02:08,015 --> 01:02:10,518
I want to go north
to the Wall.

693
01:02:10,601 --> 01:02:13,312
No, you don't.

694
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:15,064
I can pay.

695
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:18,276
There is nothing
in the North but ice
and war and pirates.

696
01:02:18,359 --> 01:02:20,903
I wouldn't need a cabin.
Please.

697
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:22,989
I could work
scrubbing the floors.

698
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:25,825
I'm not going north, child.
I'm going home.

699
01:02:25,908 --> 01:02:30,288
- Where's home?
- The Free City of Braavos.

700
01:02:30,371 --> 01:02:31,914
Wait.
I have something else.

701
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:33,708
More silver won't make
a difference.

702
01:02:33,791 --> 01:02:37,044
It's not silver.
It's iron.

703
01:02:39,338 --> 01:02:41,132
This...

704
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:46,429
How did you--

705
01:02:46,512 --> 01:02:48,556
<i>Valar morghulis.</i>

706
01:02:50,224 --> 01:02:52,351
<i>Valar dohaeris.</i>

707
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:55,354
Of course,
you shall have a cabin.
