1
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,904
What are they doing with the bodies?

2
00:03:57,988 --> 00:03:59,698
Get back to work.

3
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:02,367
No. I've been here for weeks.

4
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:06,621
I'm not scrubbing one more corpse
until you tell me why I'm doing it.

5
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:08,749
You will know why.

6
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:12,043
- When?
- When it's time, not before.

7
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,254
Get back to work.

8
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:17,215
- When do I get to play the game?
- Game?

9
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:20,093
The game. The game of faces.

10
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:23,472
You tried already. You failed.

11
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:24,741
I didn't even know I was playing.

12
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,349
Who are you?

13
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:28,852
No one.

14
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,605
Get back to work.

15
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:33,106
Who are you?

16
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:36,193
What are you doing here?
How did you get here?

17
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,781
I'm from Westeros, just like you.

18
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,451
Daughter of a lord, just like you.

19
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:47,370
Except I was an only child.

20
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,790
Heir to his fortune.

21
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,459
My mother died.

22
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:57,297
My father remarried,
and his new wife gave birth to a girl.

23
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:02,803
My stepmother didn't want any rivals
for her precious daughter,

24
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,180
so she tried to kill me with poison.

25
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:07,307
I found out.

26
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,601
Sought help from the faceless men.

27
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:14,773
And my father was widowed again.

28
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,652
I've been serving them ever since.

29
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:33,124
Was that true or a lie?

30
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,170
What?

31
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:39,214
Did you believe every word I said?

32
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:45,428
Get back to work.

33
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:02,362
Jaqen: Who are you?

34
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:13,582
Who are you?

35
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,592
And where did you come from?

36
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:24,843
Westeros.

37
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:31,182
My family home is winterfell.

38
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:34,936
I'm the youngest daughter of a great lord,
Eddard stark.

39
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:36,479
He died in battle.

40
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,232
A lie.

41
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:42,360
After he was executed, I erd the capital.

42
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:45,614
Had to kill a stable boy.

43
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:47,198
Drove my sword through his back.

44
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,285
A lie.

45
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,495
I stabbed him in the gut.

46
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:56,625
I tried to find my mother and brother,
but I never did.

47
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,044
They were murdered by walder frey.

48
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:02,797
An outlaw kidnapped me,
a man called polliver.

49
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:08,094
A man called the hound. Sandor clegane.

50
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,597
He tried to sell me,
but was wounded in a fight.

51
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:14,184
He begged me to kill him, but I wouldn't.
I left him in the mountains to die.

52
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,811
I wanted him to suffer. I hated him.

53
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:20,565
I hated him.

54
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:23,860
That's not a lie!

55
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,239
A girl lies to me,

56
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:31,701
to the many-faced god, to herself.

57
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,954
Does she truly want to be no one?

58
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,081
Yes.

59
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:44,047
I'm not playing this stupid game anymore!

60
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,174
We never stop playing.

61
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:12,117
So, those villages we
were supposed to find?

62
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,994
We can't live on berries and roots.

63
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:15,078
I can.

64
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,206
You're not hungry?

65
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:20,417
Of course I'm hungry.

66
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:23,503
You're an awful traveling companion,
do you know that?

67
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,463
Possibly the least
charming man I've ever met.

68
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:27,132
I'm not your traveling companion.

69
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:30,510
We are traveling together
in each other's company, therefore...

70
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,012
Do you ever shut up?

71
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:35,890
I sailed from king's landing to pentos
in a crate

72
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,852
without ever saying a word.

73
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:46,276
It never occurred to you
to ask why until now?

74
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:52,949
You never wondered why Tyrion Lannister
decided to visit a brothel in volantis?

75
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:56,327
I'm sure you visited many brothels
in many cities.

76
00:08:58,747 --> 00:08:59,914
I killed my father.

77
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:06,046
He wanted to execute me
for a crime I didn't commit.

78
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,675
And he was fucking the woman I loved.

79
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:24,731
As miserable as you are, mormont,
at least your father was a good man.

80
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,333
Jorah: What do you know about my father?

81
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:28,985
Tyrion: I met him. Ivisited the wall.

82
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:32,072
When I asked him about his men,

83
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:35,450
he knew all their stories,
every one of them.

84
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,953
He actually cared about the people
under his command.

85
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,248
How do they put it in the watch?

86
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:44,959
"We shall never see his like again."

87
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:58,181
Oh, you didn't know.

88
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:06,564
I'm sorry. I am.

89
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:10,401
How?

90
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:13,905
I only know what I heard.

91
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,281
How?

92
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:17,617
He was leading
an expedition beyond the wall.

93
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,537
There was a mutiny.

94
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,456
He was murdered by his own men.

95
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,803
We better keep moving.

96
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,521
Valar morghulis.

97
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,481
Valar dohaeris.

98
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,277
I have nowhere else to go.

99
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,906
I've taken her to every healer in braavos.

100
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,284
I've spent every penny I had.

101
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:49,125
She suffers every day of her life.

102
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,003
I just want it to end.

103
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:21,824
It hurts.

104
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:24,077
I know.

105
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,122
Don't be afraid.

106
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,000
I used to be like you.

107
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:34,170
I was sick.

108
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,090
I was dying.

109
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,514
But my father never gave up on me.

110
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,518
He loved me

111
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,231
more than anything in the world,
just like your father loves you.

112
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,692
So he brought me here.

113
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,071
My father prayed to the many-faced god,

114
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,033
and I drank the water from his fountain.

115
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,495
It healed me.

116
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:22,343
I've devoted my life to him now.

117
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:26,055
You don't want to hurt anymore?

118
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:29,809
Drink.

119
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,058
Jaqen: Is a girl ready?

120
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:20,563
To give up her ears, her nose, her tongue?

121
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:25,026
Her hopes and dreams, her loves and hates?

122
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:27,904
All that makes a girl who she is?

123
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:30,907
Forever?

124
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,916
A girl is not ready to become no one.

125
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,090
But she is ready to become someone else.

126
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,774
Why Daenerys? Why is she worth all this?

127
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:07,818
As I recall,

128
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:11,197
the mormonts fought against the targaryens
during Robert's rebellion.

129
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,699
Do you believe in anything?

130
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,034
I believe in lots of things.

131
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:17,036
In something greater
than ourselves, I mean.

132
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,247
The gods, destiny.

133
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:22,625
Do you believe there's
a plan for this world?

134
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,045
- No.
- Neither did I.

135
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:28,548
I was a cynic, just like you.

136
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:33,094
Then I saw a girl step into a great fire
with three stone eggs.

137
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,806
When the fire burned out,
I thought I'd find her blackened bones.

138
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:40,851
Instead, I saw her, Daenerys,

139
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:44,897
alive and unhurt, holding her baby dragons.

140
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,944
Have you ever heard baby dragons singing?

141
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,990
It's hard to be a cynic after that.

142
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:58,286
Doesn't mean she's
going to be a great queen.

143
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:00,413
No, it doesn't.

144
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,790
The targaryens are famously insane.

145
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:05,585
What if she conquers the world? Then what?

146
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:08,045
A thousand years of peace and prosperity?

147
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:10,256
First we have to conquer the world.

148
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,010
All right, let's assume
your dreams come true.

149
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:17,513
She's ecstatic when
you bring her this enemy dwarf.

150
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:20,600
She hacks off my head
and restores your position.

151
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:24,353
You command her army, sail to Westeros,
defeat all your enemies,

152
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:27,273
and watch her climb those steps
and sit on the iron throne.

153
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,775
Hurrah. Long live the queen. Then what?

154
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,235
Then she rules.

155
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:35,156
So, a woman who has not spent
a single day of her adult life in Westeros

156
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,366
becomes the ruler of Westeros?
That's justice?

157
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,994
- Jorah: She's the rightful heir.
- Why?

158
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:43,748
Because her father, who burned
living men for amusement, was the king?

159
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,462
- That's a slave ship.
- Why are they anchored?

160
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,339
They probably came ashore for...

161
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:52,798
Man: Water.

162
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:06,228
Got a lot of fight in you, huh?

163
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:16,822
Salt mines?

164
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:20,701
Yeah, that or a galley slave.

165
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,787
He looks strong enough.

166
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,747
What about the dwarf?

167
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:26,457
Worthless.

168
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:30,044
Cut his throat.

169
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,630
Wait. Wait. Wait, wait,
wait! Let's discuss this.

170
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,173
And then chop off his cock.

171
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:36,300
We'll sell it for a fortune.

172
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,427
A dwarf's cock has magic powers.

173
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:41,847
Wait! Wait! Wait, wait, wait!

174
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:46,435
You can't just hand a dry cock to a
merchant and expect him to pay for it.

175
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:48,354
He has to know it came from a dwarf.

176
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:51,774
And how could he know
unless he sees the dwarf?

177
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,609
It will be a dwarf-sized cock.

178
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:55,611
Guess again.

179
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:03,869
The dwarf lives until
we find a cock merchant.

180
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,588
Queen Daenerys has outlawed slavery.

181
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:17,758
We're bound for volantis, not slaver's bay.

182
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:21,303
Besides, she reopened the fighting pits.

183
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,140
I've never heard of free men
fighting in the pits.

184
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,559
Tyrion: The fighting pits in meereen?

185
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:29,061
You're in luck, then.
You're about to be rich.

186
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,940
You are looking at one of the great
warriors in the seven kingdoms.

187
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:36,193
Him.

188
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:38,028
Him?

189
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,823
He's got to be 60 years old.

190
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:45,911
Sure, he's a bit long in the tooth,
a bit withered, been in the sun too long.

191
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:49,874
We can all see that.
But he is a veteran of 100 battles.

192
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:52,126
They wrote songs about him.

193
00:20:58,632 --> 00:20:59,884
That true?

194
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:10,186
He won the tournament at lannisport,
unseating ser Jaime Lannister himself.

195
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:15,441
The kingslayer.

196
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:18,694
Jousting. You're talking aboutjousting.

197
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:21,280
A fancy game for fancy lads.

198
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:23,908
The men who fight in the pits of meereen
will swallow him whole.

199
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:26,577
Jorah: I killed a Dothraki bloodrider
in single combat.

200
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:38,839
Liar.

201
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:41,634
It's no lie. His name was qotho.

202
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:44,053
He was bloodrider to khal drogo.

203
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:48,599
Take me to slaver's bay,
put a sword in my hand,

204
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:49,892
I'll prove my worth.

205
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:05,074
For my children. Money.

206
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:09,745
Lord baelish.

207
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:11,872
Yes?

208
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,418
Lancel Lannister.

209
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:20,506
Brother lancel.

210
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,007
We abandon our family names.

211
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:23,843
That's quite a family to abandon.

212
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:27,096
The city has changed
since you were here last.

213
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,931
We flooded the gutters with wine,

214
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,684
smashed the false idols,

215
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,561
and set the godless on the run.

216
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:35,437
Well done.

217
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,320
I'm here on urgent business
for the queen mother.

218
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,991
Should I send word that I'll be delayed?

219
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:52,705
Step carefully, lord baelish.

220
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:56,667
You'll find there's little tolerance for
flesh peddlers in the new king's landing.

221
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,712
We both peddle fantasies, brother lancel.

222
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:02,256
Mine just happen to be entertaining.

223
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:14,310
Do you think it's wise, your grace,

224
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,562
arresting the heir to highgarden?

225
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:19,398
The faith arrested the heir to highgarden.

226
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:22,526
Of course, and the faith
were armed on your orders.

227
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,278
The king's orders.

228
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:26,488
Is the king to blame
for ser loras' perversion?

229
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:28,490
House Tyrell won't tolerate this insult.

230
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,784
House Tyrell won't tolerate it?

231
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:33,704
I'm the insulted party, lord baelish.

232
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:37,333
Ser loras was promised to me.
Instead, he chose the company of boys.

233
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,668
One's choice of
companion is a curious thing.

234
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:44,006
Most curious.

235
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,594
Lysa arryn, for instance.

236
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:50,429
A thoroughly repellant woman.

237
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,307
Forgive me.

238
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,768
I know you're still in mourning.

239
00:23:56,518 --> 00:24:00,564
Lysa was a good woman. A kind woman.

240
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:03,275
She was neither of those things.
We both know it.

241
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:05,152
Still, I pity her son.

242
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:10,199
How fortunate the young lord of the vale
has a new father to counsel him.

243
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,534
I know how hard it can be

244
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:14,954
to lose both your parents
at such a young age.

245
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:18,037
If war comes to Westeros, will the
knights of the vale fight for their king?

246
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:21,585
Young lord Robin heeds my advice,

247
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:25,547
and I have always counseled
loyalty to the throne.

248
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:27,216
Good.

249
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,514
If there's nothing else.

250
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:36,684
There is another matter, your grace.

251
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:39,269
Something so urgent
I couldn't trust the words to a raven.

252
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:42,231
You once charged me
with finding Arya stark.

253
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,358
To my shame, I failed you.

254
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:47,403
But I have found sansa stark.

255
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:52,825
Alive and well and home again

256
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:53,993
living at winterfell.

257
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,286
That's not possible.

258
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:58,622
My sources are well placed.

259
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:04,461
They tell me roose Bolton
plans to marry her to his son, ramsay,

260
00:25:04,545 --> 00:25:07,047
a bastard recently legitimized
by king tommen.

261
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:10,843
Roose Bolton is warden of the north
by the grace of my father.

262
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:14,888
Indeed, his reward
for stabbing his own king in the heart.

263
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,475
We were fools to trust a turncloak.

264
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:22,521
Marrying his son to the last of the starks
gives him more legitimacy in the north

265
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:24,773
than an alliance with a
hated southern house.

266
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:30,154
I will skin him and his bastard
like that wretch on their bloody sigil.

267
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:31,864
I would counsel Patience, your grace.

268
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:33,490
Pafience?

269
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:36,660
Sansa helped murder my son.
Roose Bolton is a traitor.

270
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:40,622
Stannis Baratheon is also a traitor,
marching with his army on winterfell.

271
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:43,625
Let Stannis and roose battle.

272
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:45,603
Let the enemies of the throne
slaughter each other.

273
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:49,339
And when they're done, seize
winterfell from whichever thief survives.

274
00:25:49,423 --> 00:25:54,011
Winterfell is 1,000 miles away from here.
The weather has already begun to turn.

275
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:58,515
That is why it is critical to strike soon,
while the Victor still licks his wounds.

276
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:03,395
Surely your uncle kevan
could muster a force.

277
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:06,732
My uncle kevan has all the courage
of a kitchen mouse.

278
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,150
Ser Jaime, then.

279
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:11,070
Jaime's away
on a sensitive diplomatic mission.

280
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:13,906
I have no idea when he'll be back.

281
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,657
Perhaps I can help.

282
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:19,870
The knights of the vale
are some of the best fighters in Westeros,

283
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:21,914
trained to battle in the ice and the snow.

284
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:23,957
Forgive me, lord baelish,

285
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:29,630
you have a reputation as a moneylender
and a brothel keeper, not a military man.

286
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:34,218
You wouldn't risk a single Lannister soldier
or a single coin from the royal treasury.

287
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:36,261
What do you have to lose?

288
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:38,680
A brothel keeper?

289
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:40,265
And if you succeed?

290
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:42,392
Name me warden of the north.

291
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,316
I'll speak to the king this evening,

292
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,569
have him issue a royal decree.

293
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:55,614
I'll not rest until the
lion flies over winterfell.

294
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:57,866
I'll know you're a man of your word

295
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,786
when I see sansa stark's head on a spike.

296
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:01,912
As I said,

297
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,832
I live to serve.

298
00:27:11,088 --> 00:27:13,507
I'm going to ask him tomorrow.

299
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,844
- What if he says no?
- He won't.

300
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:18,762
We've waited long enough.

301
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:21,807
I want you to be my wife.

302
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,267
Now.

303
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:25,769
What is it?

304
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:29,648
Do you want to marry me
because our families arranged it?

305
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,024
Or do you...

306
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:41,451
We can't. Not yet.

307
00:27:41,535 --> 00:27:42,578
Why not?

308
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,746
You know why not. Someone will see.

309
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:47,207
You are going to be my wife.

310
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:51,086
I am going to be your husband.

311
00:27:51,545 --> 00:27:54,089
We're allowed
to walk through the gardens together.

312
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:57,676
How many other girls
have you walked through these gardens?

313
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:02,347
I like the way your eyes go squinty
when you're jealous.

314
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:04,975
They do not go squinty,
and you didn't answer the question.

315
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:08,187
Doran: They make a lovely couple.

316
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:10,898
A Lannister and a martell.

317
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:14,860
They have no idea how dangerous that is.

318
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:17,321
We must protect them.

319
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:19,281
Yes, my prince.

320
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:23,744
You haven't had to use
that ax of yours in a long time.

321
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:27,164
I hope you remember how.

322
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:29,750
I remember how.

323
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:36,381
Bronn: The
dornishman's wife was as fair as the sun

324
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:40,427
and her kisses were warmer than spring

325
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:45,682
the dornishman's blade
it was made of black steel

326
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:48,810
and its kiss was a terrible thing

327
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:53,982
the dornishman's wife
would sing as she bathed

328
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:56,860
in a voice that was sweet as a peach...

329
00:28:56,944 --> 00:28:58,570
All right, that's enough.

330
00:28:58,654 --> 00:29:00,405
I'm coming to the best part.

331
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:02,532
We're trying to blend in.

332
00:29:02,616 --> 00:29:04,469
Don't want everyone in dorne
to hear your accent.

333
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:06,203
This song really is all about the ending.

334
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:08,664
It can wait. There.

335
00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:13,877
That's the water gardens.

336
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:16,505
Bronn: And once we've got the Princess,
then what?

337
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:20,759
I like to improvise.

338
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:24,179
That explains the golden hand.

339
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:47,703
Ellaria: Unbowed. Unbent. Unbroken.

340
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:50,664
For oberyn.

341
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:52,374
All: For oberyn.

342
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:34,666
Well, she's made herself at home.

343
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:41,465
Myrcella.

344
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,094
Uncle Jaime?

345
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:50,891
I don't understand.
What are you doing here?

346
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,434
Let's speak in private.

347
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:53,894
I am trystane martell.

348
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,188
Trystane is my intended.

349
00:30:56,897 --> 00:30:58,774
Excellent. Good to meet you.

350
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:00,609
We weren't expecting you, lord Jaime.

351
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:03,695
Why don't you let them
have some time alone, son?

352
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,285
Let's not do something stupid.

353
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:16,708
That was something stupid.

354
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:18,377
We have to go, myrcella, now.

355
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,503
You hurt him!

356
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:21,306
He'll be fine, I promise. But we have to...

357
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:27,469
Oh, for fuck's sake.

358
00:32:10,137 --> 00:32:11,179
Take her!

359
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:15,576
- You're coming with me.
- I don't want to.

360
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,519
I wasn't asking, Princess.

361
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,154
Drop your weapons!

362
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,706
I am obara sand.

363
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:39,541
Daughter of oberyn martell.

364
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:43,295
I fight for dorne. Who do you fight for?

365
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:45,338
Drop your weapons.

366
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:06,568
When you were whole,
it would have been a good fight.

367
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:19,331
You fight pretty good for a little girl.

368
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:47,609
Halt!

369
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:53,865
You can smell the shit
from five miles away.

370
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:56,117
Well, why have we stopped? Go on.

371
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:03,208
Rumors and gossip, that's all they've got.

372
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,210
It's theater, nothing more.

373
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:08,630
If they arrested
all the pillow biters in king's landing,

374
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:11,508
there'd be no room left in the dungeons
for anyone else.

375
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:13,301
Everyone knew about him and renly.

376
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:16,972
Renly Baratheon shagged
half the stable boys in the seven kingdoms.

377
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,807
Everyone knew, no one cared.

378
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,225
But he was the king's brother.

379
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:22,185
And loras is the queen's brother.

380
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:24,646
No, no, no, no. This is unacceptable.

381
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:27,023
- Cersei's behind it.
- Yes, of course she is.

382
00:34:27,107 --> 00:34:31,111
She wants to drag our name
through the dirt, put us in our place.

383
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:33,113
Get some rest, dear. You look appalling.

384
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:35,323
And let me deal with Cersei Lannister.

385
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:45,000
Your grace, I have traveled a long way.

386
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:47,502
You must be exhausted.

387
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:53,133
Put the pen down, dear.
We both know you're not writing anything.

388
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:56,136
Ah, yes. The famously tart-tongued
queen of thorns.

389
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:59,180
And the famous tart, queen Cersei.

390
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:04,728
I beg your pardon?

391
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:08,189
I know you're behind
this absurd incarceration of my grandson.

392
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,775
If you apologize for that comment,
perhaps I'll...

393
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:13,695
You'll get your apology when I get loras.

394
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:19,075
I was as shocked as anyone
when the faith arrested ser loras.

395
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:22,078
I have no love for these fanatics,

396
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:24,706
but what can a queen mother do?

397
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:28,084
Has the crown suddenly stopped needing

398
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:31,338
the troops, gold,
and wheat my house supplies?

399
00:35:31,421 --> 00:35:35,467
I can assure you,
our alliance with house Tyrell remains...

400
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:39,888
Do you expect the alliance to continue
after you've thrown our future into prison?

401
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:42,223
As I said,

402
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,643
I didn't imprison anyone.

403
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:46,311
As for your veiled threats...

404
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:47,562
What veil?

405
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:54,486
The Lannister-Tyrell alliance brought peace
to a war-torn country.

406
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:57,739
Do you really want to see
the seven kingdoms slide back into warfare?

407
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,577
I didn't trust your father.

408
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:05,538
I didn't particularly like him.

409
00:36:05,622 --> 00:36:08,792
But I respected him. He was no fool.

410
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:12,420
He understood that sometimes
we must work with our rivals

411
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:14,089
rather than destroy them.

412
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:16,257
House Lannister has no rival.

413
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:22,222
The high septon has called for an inquest,
not a trial.

414
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:26,851
Just a small hearing to determine whether
the charges against loras have merit,

415
00:36:26,935 --> 00:36:28,853
which I'm sure they don't.

416
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:32,190
Loras will be freed,
our happy alliance will continue,

417
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:36,986
and we'll forget this unfortunate
conversation ever happened.

418
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:40,323
Good day, lady olenna.

419
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:02,971
High sparrow: You are aware of
the rumors concerning you and renly?

420
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:06,558
I don't pay attention to rumors.

421
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:09,728
High sparrow: You were said
to be despondent when he died.

422
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:13,356
Witnesses state that you
refused to leave his bedside,

423
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,984
even as Stannis' army closed in.

424
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:17,736
He was my friend.

425
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:19,821
He was my king.

426
00:37:20,822 --> 00:37:22,490
Wasn't Joffrey your king?

427
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:25,577
He was anointed by the seven, not renly.

428
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:30,206
I was wrong to support
renly's claim, I know that.

429
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,168
But I was forgiven by Joffrey.

430
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,087
I fought for him at the
battle of Blackwater.

431
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:39,090
Yes, wearing renly's armor.

432
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,676
Why does it matter what I wore?

433
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,429
Do you deny all the charges against you?

434
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:45,555
Fornication.

435
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:49,225
Buggery. Blasphemy.

436
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:50,727
Of course I deny them.

437
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,771
You never lay with renly Baratheon?

438
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:54,564
Never.

439
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:56,816
Nor any other man?

440
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:58,526
Never.

441
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:03,948
That will be all, ser loras.

442
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,541
Well, I think that's quite enough of that.

443
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:16,211
The faith calls queen margaery fon/vard.

444
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:18,213
You call me fon/vard?

445
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:20,632
Yes, we have some questions for you.

446
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,552
- I am the queen.
- You are.

447
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:27,222
And according to the law of the seven,

448
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:32,811
neither kings nor queens are exempt
from testimony at a holy inquest.

449
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:54,207
How do you respond to
these charges against your brother?

450
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:56,167
They are lies.

451
00:38:56,251 --> 00:38:57,585
- All of them?
- All of them.

452
00:38:58,503 --> 00:38:59,921
High sparrow: Queen margaery,

453
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:04,509
in the presence of the gods,
do you swear that your brother is innocent

454
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:07,637
of these charges against him,
to the best of your knowledge?

455
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:09,681
Margaery: Yes, I swear it.

456
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:13,977
Thank you, your grace.

457
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:40,920
Do you know this man?

458
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:42,797
Yes.

459
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:44,632
Very well.

460
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:47,760
He is ser loras Tyrell, heir to highgarden.

461
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:49,721
How did you come to meet?

462
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:52,473
Olwar: I squired for him.

463
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,434
He took a liking to me.

464
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:56,811
He summoned me to his chamber
the first day we met.

465
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:02,066
And what occurred in his chamber?

466
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:06,654
We engaged in intimate relations.

467
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:08,990
You lay with him?

468
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,366
That night and many others.

469
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:12,827
Liar. He's a liar.

470
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,247
Is there anyone else
who can support your claim?

471
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:18,625
Yes.

472
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,335
Yes, queen margaery.

473
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:24,964
She walked in on us once, not long ago.

474
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:27,050
She didn't seem surprised.

475
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:30,887
This testimony is an
insult to a great house.

476
00:40:31,638 --> 00:40:33,038
Why should the faith or anyone else

477
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:36,267
take the word of a squire
over the heir to highgarden?

478
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:38,478
Olwar: He has a birthmark, your grace.

479
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:40,980
Quite high on his thigh.

480
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:44,525
Wine-colored
and roughly the shape of dorne.

481
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:46,486
No! Liar!

482
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:52,700
What are you doing? Let us pass.

483
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:55,411
The faith is satisfied
there is enough evidence

484
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:57,246
to bring a formal trial

485
00:40:57,789 --> 00:40:59,457
for ser loras

486
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:01,376
and queen margaery.

487
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:02,752
What?

488
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:07,382
Bearing false witness before the gods
is as grave a sin as any, my lady.

489
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,883
Take her.

490
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:10,677
Margaery: No.

491
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:12,136
Tommen.

492
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:13,346
Tommen!

493
00:41:14,931 --> 00:41:17,100
You can't do this. I am the queen.

494
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:19,811
Tommen! Tommen!

495
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:23,898
I am your queen. How dare you?
Take your hands off me!

496
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,442
Tommen!

497
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:51,092
What do you want?

498
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:54,929
Lord ramsay sent me
to draw your bath, my lady.

499
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:59,934
You want to be clean and fresh
for your new husband, don't you?

500
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:18,327
You're so beautiful,

501
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:20,788
but you need to keep him happy.

502
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:24,584
Ramsay gets bored easily.

503
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:28,254
You don't want to end up like...

504
00:42:30,423 --> 00:42:32,967
We”, like the others.

505
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:35,470
What others?

506
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,971
I shouldn't gossip.

507
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,474
Oh, it's good to see the red again.

508
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:42,226
No point hiding anymore.

509
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:43,811
What others?

510
00:42:43,895 --> 00:42:48,691
Let's see, there was Kyra,
the blacksmith's daughter.

511
00:42:48,775 --> 00:42:51,277
She was tall like you, lovely figure.

512
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:55,782
But she talked and talked and talked,

513
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:59,077
and ramsay grew tired of that.

514
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,412
Then there was Violet.

515
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:04,123
She had gorgeous blonde hair.

516
00:43:04,207 --> 00:43:07,085
But she got pregnant.

517
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:10,004
And, well, that was boring.

518
00:43:11,172 --> 00:43:13,758
Then tansy.

519
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,635
Such a sweet girl.

520
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:20,681
Of course, sweet girls get a bit dull

521
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:22,725
after a while, don't they?

522
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:25,186
Ramsay let me come with him on that hunt.

523
00:43:25,353 --> 00:43:26,479
Hunt?

524
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:27,730
Mmm.

525
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:33,861
Have you ever seen a body
after the dogs have been at it?

526
00:43:34,821 --> 00:43:36,614
Not so pretty.

527
00:43:38,825 --> 00:43:41,202
But, well, it's your wedding day.

528
00:43:41,911 --> 00:43:44,330
Why am I talking about such things?

529
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:48,292
What was your name again?

530
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:49,877
Myranda.

531
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:54,882
And how long have you loved him, myranda?

532
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:01,347
Did you imagine that he would
be with you forever, is that it?

533
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:03,307
And I came along and ruined it.

534
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:09,313
I'm sansa stark of winterfell.

535
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:14,277
This is my home, and you can't frighten me.

536
00:44:20,575 --> 00:44:22,910
Are you done with your bath, my lady?

537
00:44:23,995 --> 00:44:25,413
Go. I can finish on my own.

538
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:53,399
Yes?

539
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:05,077
I've come to escort you
to the godswood, my lady.

540
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:12,710
If you please, my lady,
will you take my arm?

541
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:18,799
Lord ramsay, he said I'm to take your arm.

542
00:45:18,883 --> 00:45:20,176
I'm not touching you.

543
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:23,804
Please.

544
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:26,182
He'll punish me.

545
00:45:28,184 --> 00:45:30,811
You think I care what he does to you?

546
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:50,808
Who comes before the old gods this night?

547
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:55,062
Theon: Sansa of the house stark

548
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:58,232
comes here to be wed.

549
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:04,238
A woman grown, trueborn and noble.

550
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:07,867
She comes to beg the blessings of the gods.

551
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:12,246
Who comes to claim her?

552
00:47:21,464 --> 00:47:23,174
Ramsay of house Bolton.

553
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,844
Heir to the dreadfort and winterfell.

554
00:47:29,722 --> 00:47:31,265
Who gives her?

555
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:39,231
Theon of house greyjoy, who was...

556
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:45,404
Who was her father's ward.

557
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:51,118
Lady sansa, will you take this man?

558
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:23,067
I take this man.

559
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:56,517
Are you pleased, my lady?

560
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:02,606
Good. I want you to be happy.

561
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:15,202
My father said you're still a virgin.

562
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:22,460
Uh, yes.

563
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:29,633
Why are you still a virgin?

564
00:49:31,302 --> 00:49:32,553
Afraid of dwarves?

565
00:49:34,472 --> 00:49:36,348
Lord Tyrion was kind.

566
00:49:36,432 --> 00:49:39,768
He was gentle. He never touched me.

567
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:43,022
You're not lying to me?

568
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:44,982
Sansa: No, my lord.

569
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:47,401
Lying to your husband on his wedding night,

570
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:51,113
that would be a bad
way to start a marriage.

571
00:49:56,285 --> 00:49:58,120
We're man and wife now.

572
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:01,665
We should be honest with each other.

573
00:50:01,749 --> 00:50:02,958
Don't you think?

574
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:05,753
Yes.

575
00:50:16,347 --> 00:50:17,598
Good.

576
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:21,769
Take off your clothes.

577
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:27,691
Oh, no, no, no.

578
00:50:28,776 --> 00:50:30,528
You stay here, reek.

579
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:32,947
You watch.

580
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:47,795
Do I need to ask a second time?

581
00:50:48,337 --> 00:50:50,130
I hate asking a second time.

582
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:19,660
Reek.

583
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:22,830
I told you to watch.

584
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:31,547
You've known sansa since she was a girl.

585
00:51:33,132 --> 00:51:34,842
Now watch her become a woman.
