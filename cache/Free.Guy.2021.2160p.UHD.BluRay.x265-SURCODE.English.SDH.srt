What are you doing?

- What?
- Seriously.

332
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:01,980
- The whole thing. The face, the outfit.
- How?

333

- Take it off.

And now he's lying about it

468
00:23:43,882 --> 00:23:46,176

and the royalties that we deserve.

- You were right.
- Oh, come on in.

926
00:48:59,396 --> 00:49:01,815
You were right.
Our code, it is in <i>Free City</i>

927
00:49:01,982 --> 00:49:04,693
and, Millie, it works.

I'm saying that our game, <i>Life Itself,</i>

00:49:10,949 --> 00:49:13,743
where characters would grow
and change and feel real…

- Keys.
- The Al worked.

934
00:49:16,955 --> 00:49:20,292
It's the reason why <i>Free City</i> is
so realistic and people love it so much.

935
00:49:20,459 --> 00:49:22,335
And of course it doesn't look the same.

936

There's no waterfalls,
there's no butterflies and unicorns,

937
00:49:25,464 --> 00:49:28,258
all the characters have different skins.
Of course they do.

938
00:49:28,425 --> 00:49:32,846
But the underlying code in the game
is the same. Our code.

00:49:43,273 --> 00:49:44,691
… is not a player.

945
00:49:45,108 --> 00:49:47,944
He is an algorithm
who thinks he's alive.

946
00:49:48,111 --> 00:49:50,280
I mean, hell, technically, he is alive.

947
00:49:50,363 --> 00:49:54,493
He is the first real
artificial intelligence.

948
00:49:55,952 --> 00:49:57,704
- (EXCLAIMS) No! No.
- KEYS: I know.

949
00:49:57,871 --> 00:49:59,247
- No, no, no.
- Yeah, yeah.

950
00:49:59,414 --> 00:50:00,790
- Guy? My Guy?
- KEYS: Guy.

951
00:50:00,957 --> 00:50:02,125
- One who has been…
- Your Guy?

952
00:50:02,292 --> 00:50:03,418
- Holy…
- KEYS: This is a good thing.

953
00:50:03,585 --> 00:50:05,086
No, it's really bad.

954
00:50:05,253 --> 00:50:08,423
Millie, his code, it's thousands
of times the size it should be.

955
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:09,925
We did it, Mills.

956
00:50:11,051 --> 00:50:14,971
We did it. Everything that we wanted
to create, it actually happened.

957
00:50:15,138 --> 00:50:18,058
Okay? Did you know
that the NPCs have private lives?

958
00:50:18,975 --> 00:50:21,102
One of the baristas learned how to make
a cappuccino through trial and error.

959
00:50:21,269 --> 00:50:23,271
I mean, that's really difficult.
I can't even do that.

960
00:50:23,438 --> 00:50:25,357
I can't even froth my own oat milk
in the morning.

961
00:50:25,815 --> 00:50:28,068
And the Bombshell character in the game

962
00:50:28,235 --> 00:50:30,946
wrote a memoir
that's a searing indictment

963
00:50:31,112 --> 00:50:32,822
of gender roles, the patriarchy…

964
00:50:32,989 --> 00:50:34,783
It's a little preachy in parts,
but overall, it's pretty good.

965
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:35,951
Millie, we have to celebrate!

966
00:50:36,076 --> 00:50:37,869
- No, this can't be happening.
- What are you talking about?

967
00:50:38,036 --> 00:50:40,539
- This is what we've been working for!
- No, I let him kiss me!

968
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,500
So, yeah.

969
00:50:45,502 --> 00:50:46,586
(CHUCKLES)

970
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,421
I'm sorry, wait, you let who kiss you?

971
00:50:48,588 --> 00:50:49,631
MILLIE: Guy.

972
00:50:50,757 --> 00:50:51,758
Guy?

973
00:50:51,841 --> 00:50:56,555
The first time I kiss a non-toxic guy
in like forever

974
00:50:56,721 --> 00:50:59,349
and of course he's not even real!

975
00:50:59,516 --> 00:51:00,850
Uh, there's not a button for that.

976
00:51:01,726 --> 00:51:03,186
Oh, he found the button.

977
00:51:03,353 --> 00:51:04,813
- Okay.
- MILLIE: Yeah.

978
00:51:04,896 --> 00:51:07,190
- I am… I'm so confused.
- Why is it so hot?

979
00:51:07,357 --> 00:51:08,525
KEYS: And surprisingly curious.

980
00:51:09,192 --> 00:51:12,904
(CHUCKLES)
You let an artificially intelligent

981
00:51:12,988 --> 00:51:14,698
- video game character kiss you?
- Oh, okay,

982
00:51:14,781 --> 00:51:16,324
- can you just stop saying it like that?
- And then you thought that would be…

983
00:51:16,491 --> 00:51:18,368
Because you have got to meet him, Keys.

984
00:51:18,535 --> 00:51:21,496
He's funny, and he's sweet,
and he's so handsome.

985
00:51:21,663 --> 00:51:23,915
Oh, my God,
now I'm saying it out loud.

986
00:51:24,082 --> 00:51:27,544
Also, Millie, food for thought,
he's like four.

987
00:51:28,044 --> 00:51:29,129
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

988
00:51:29,212 --> 00:51:30,839
- Really? You're gonna do that?
- Really.

989
00:51:31,006 --> 00:51:32,632
Wow, you just made that really creepy.

990
00:51:32,716 --> 00:51:33,717
(BOTH LAUGHING)

991
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,010
Millie, put all that aside.

992
00:51:35,093 --> 00:51:36,386
Weird or not,
when people find out about this,

993
00:51:36,469 --> 00:51:39,055
you could win a Nobel Prize.
Oh, God.

994
00:51:39,222 --> 00:51:40,223
What?

995
00:51:40,307 --> 00:51:41,766
Oh, my God, if they see this…

996
00:51:42,225 --> 00:51:43,518
- MILLIE: What? What is it?
- Oh!

997
00:51:43,643 --> 00:51:45,020
KEYS: Antwan. What else?

998
00:51:45,562 --> 00:51:47,981
He's lying.
He lied about using our code,

999
00:51:48,148 --> 00:51:50,233
he's been lying about the game
being backwards compatible.

1000
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,735
I think he's lying about <i>Free City 1.</i>

1001
00:51:51,818 --> 00:51:52,861
What are you talking about?

1002
00:51:52,944 --> 00:51:56,865
KEYS: Look. You see? There's not
one mission, not one location…

1003
00:51:56,948 --> 00:51:59,075
I mean, there's not even a single
character from <i>Free City 1</i> on here.

1004
00:51:59,242 --> 00:52:00,660
<i>Free City 2</i> is not an update…

1005
00:52:00,827 --> 00:52:02,120
- It's a replacement.
- Exactly.

1006
00:52:02,287 --> 00:52:03,913
So when <i>Free City 2</i> launches
on Monday…

1007
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:07,375
Blue Shirt Guy, all proof of our code,
everything will be deleted.

1008
00:52:07,542 --> 00:52:08,793
He can't do that.

1009
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:12,130
I mean, this is artificial life we're
dealing with. I mean, that's insane.

1010
00:52:15,759 --> 00:52:16,926
We're screwed.

1011
00:52:17,636 --> 00:52:19,220
Maybe not.

1012
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:21,848
If we can find our original build
in the game,

1013
00:52:22,015 --> 00:52:24,684
it'll prove that Antwan used our code
without properly licensing it.

1014
00:52:24,851 --> 00:52:27,020
And we just have to find it
before <i>Free City 2</i> launches.

1015
00:52:27,187 --> 00:52:28,438
We have 48 hours.

1016
00:52:28,605 --> 00:52:30,023
I've looked, Keys. You know I have.

1017
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:31,316
I know you have.

1018
00:52:31,483 --> 00:52:33,860
But now that we both know
about Blue Shirt Guy,

1019
00:52:34,027 --> 00:52:35,528
maybe he can help?

1020
00:52:35,695 --> 00:52:37,447
That would mean I'd have to tell him.

1021
00:52:38,114 --> 00:52:40,992
Millie, he's not gonna exist
once the sequel launches.

1022
00:52:42,369 --> 00:52:43,620
His whole world's about to end.

1023
00:52:44,371 --> 00:52:46,498
Don't you think
he'd want a chance to save it?

1024
00:52:48,792 --> 00:52:50,752
- ICE CREAM VENDOR: Here you go.
- Thank you.

1025
00:52:50,919 --> 00:52:52,921
- You got it.
- MILLIE: Guy?

1026
00:52:53,088 --> 00:52:54,339
Hey! Hi!

1027
00:52:54,506 --> 00:52:55,799
Guy, we need to talk.

1028
00:52:56,174 --> 00:52:58,551
What's going on with your voice?
Where's your Australian accent?

1029
00:52:58,718 --> 00:52:59,719
British.

1030
00:52:59,803 --> 00:53:01,763
I think I know an Australian accent
when I see one.

1031
00:53:02,555 --> 00:53:04,015
I turned off the accent filter.

1032
00:53:05,475 --> 00:53:06,559
This is me.

1033
00:53:07,018 --> 00:53:08,019
Good.

1034
00:53:08,103 --> 00:53:10,230
Look, I have to tell you something
really important.

1035
00:53:10,397 --> 00:53:11,481
- Are you married?
- (GASPS)

1036
00:53:11,564 --> 00:53:12,565
No.

1037
00:53:12,649 --> 00:53:15,068
- Oh, God.
- (BOTH LAUGHING)

1038
00:53:16,111 --> 00:53:18,071
That would have been like
the worst thing ever.

1039
00:53:18,238 --> 00:53:19,864
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
Maybe not the worst thing.

1040
00:53:20,281 --> 00:53:21,449
Huh.

1041
00:53:21,533 --> 00:53:23,159
I have to show you something.

1042
00:53:24,369 --> 00:53:25,370
Okay.

1043
00:53:26,705 --> 00:53:28,540
(DISTANT SIREN WAILING)

He's my friend, I know that guy.

I don't get it. What is this place?

1053
00:53:54,566 --> 00:53:58,945
There is no easy way to say this,
but this city is a game.

1054
00:53:59,112 --> 00:54:01,364
There's no easy way to say this,
I know it's a game.

1055
00:54:01,531 --> 00:54:03,283
You taught me how to play it.
(PLAYFULLY) Boop-boop.

MILLIE: Yes, you're right, I did.

1057
00:54:04,909 --> 00:54:07,954
But it's not just that it's like a game.
It is a game.

1058
00:54:08,830 --> 00:54:11,458
It's a video game. And that's all it is.

So the entire world is a game?

Yes.

1061

And we're all just players in the game?

I love you.

you, all the people in it

My whole life, I felt like there had
to be something more.

And then I saw you.
