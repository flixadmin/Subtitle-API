[Zari] <i>Previously on</i>
Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,200
That's my mom.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:09,160
There's no loophole where I can
save my family and not screw up history.

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,356
I'm so sorry, Z.

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,960
What the hell is going on here?

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,679
This is my dad, Hank.

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,276
Hello, John.

8
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,056
[Constantine] The knuckle bones
of a martyred saint.

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,073
They act as a divining rod able
to detect the presence of beings

10
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,719
<i>not belonging to our world.</i>

11
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,315
Where did the unicorn go?

12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,176
Ah! Sent that bastard
straight to hell, didn't I?

13
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,237
You need to be part of a team.

14
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,712
No. I would rather bloody
top myself than move in with you lot.

15
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,878
<i>People around me get killed,
or far worse.</i>

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,076
[sighs] Bollocks.

17
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,711
[Sara] How's our magical
upgrade going, Ray?

18
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,473
[Ray] Almost done, I think,

19
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,029
though they never covered
how to interface time seismographs

20
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,635
and enchanted bones
in the IVU Ph.D program.

21
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,710
Ah.

22
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,359
Well, that should do it.

23
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,509
My peers would say that science
and magic don't mix.

24
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,434
But to them, I'd ask,
"Have you seen <i>The Fifth Element?"</i>

25
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,920
Am I right?

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,231
IVU sounds like a real party school.

27
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,800
[Sara sighs] I hope this works.

28
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,839
We need a way to pinpoint
magical threats on the timeline.

29
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,674
I mean, who knows
what kind of creatures are out there

30
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,160
wreaking havoc on history.

31
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,994
- Like, uh, vampires.
- Gremlins.

32
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,196
Aswangs.

33
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,911
Cannibalistic Filipino werebeasts
with proboscis-like tongues.

34
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,837
I've been doing some research
just in case.

35
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,752
I thought that's why we had Constantine.

36
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,480
Yeah. About that,

37
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,676
Constantine is...

38
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,832
Tired, hungover
and in need of a stiff one.

39
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,195
[trunk thuds]

40
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,791
Dealer's choice as to
what that's a euphemism for.

41
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,679
He's here.

42
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,797
Yeah, I meant what I said
about joining you lot,

43
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,879
but then, I pictured that same lot
squaring off against

44
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,316
some of the manky buggers
that I've come up against,

45
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,357
and I thought, "You know what?
You're right."

46
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,352
You're all bloody doomed without me.

47
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,879
One Aswang will take you down
without breaking a sweat.

48
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,157
[laughs] New Legend alert.

49
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,720
I better go update the chore wheel.

50
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,256
[Constantine] Whoa, hang on, sunshine.

51
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,839
I'm not a bloody Legend.

52
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,151
I'm merely offering my services
as a consultant,

53
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,392
and, as such, I have some stipulations.

54
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,757
I don't do silly costumes.
I expect full benefits.

55
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,550
And I require no less than
two weeks paid vacation.

56
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,711
- Vacation?
- Paid?

57
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,800
Easy.

58
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,400
[whirring]

59
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,834
Hey, it worked.

60
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,596
[Zari] Will you look at that?
We already got a...

61
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,718
Do we have a special name
for these magical fugitives?

62
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,032
Well, I was thinking, since they're
mysteries involving mythical beings,

63
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,116
we could go with "Myth-teries."

64
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,069
"Fugitives," it is. What does it say?

65
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,358
Salem, Massachusetts, 1692.

66
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,201
First day on the job, and you're
taking me to the bloody witch trials.

67
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,279
Well, I hope you're feeling
morally superior

68
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:05,197
because we are getting
our Puritan Purit-on!

69
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,749
That was too much, right?

70
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,056
[Constantine] I'm telling you,
your machine is clearly buggered.

71
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,470
There's nothing magical
about Puritan New England.

72
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,029
I know. I was there.
But it could all be different now.

73
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,157
Oh, come on. If a creature landed there,

74
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,398
why would it idle in the absolute
worst possible place for magic.

75
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,080
People of Salem are paranoid
and petty. And besides,

76
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,516
every magical creature knows
that, if you wanna get weird,

77
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,875
you go to New York.

78
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,758
Then we need to find it before it flees.

79
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,616
All right, well, I agreed
to help you save history,

80
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,314
not take part in
your little role-playing adventures.

81
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,959
Call me if you find anything.

82
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,913
If he's staying, I'm staying.

83
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,754
Besides, no fun in Puritan times.

84
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,560
The Church banned
burning people at the stake.

85
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,296
[Sara] Well, they didn't
actually burn people.

86
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,390
That was the Middle Ages.

87
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,871
The Puritans used the gallows,
but, yeah, sure. Stay.

88
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,036
You know, I actually miss having
someone Natesplain history to us.

89
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,635
- Me, too.
- [Ray] Speaking of which,

90
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,030
I wonder how Operation
"Dinner with Dad" is going.

91
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,314
Thanks.

92
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,120
Good steak.

93
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,434
So what do you do for work these days?

94
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,873
Little bit of this, little bit of that.

95
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,600
You?

96
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,830
Same old, same old.

97
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,916
Sir, your credit card was declined.

98
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,638
I, um... I must've given you
the wrong one. [clears throat]

99
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,756
Here you go.

100
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,398
And this one expired in 1953.

101
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,878
And I don't know why I still carry it.

102
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,596
Do you accept Athenian tetradrachm?

103
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,956
Notgeld? Is that...

104
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,316
Nathaniel. I've got this.

105
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,075
Guess the deductive historical
reconstruction business

106
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,720
is a little slow this time of the year.

107
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,798
Yeah, and I see it's still paying off
to be a Beltway Bandit.

108
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,800
Really, Nathaniel?
That's how you wanna end this?

109
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,256
After we connect over a nice dinner.

110
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,280
Have we?

111
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,736
All you've talked about was the steak.

112
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,496
What the hell else
am I supposed to talk about?

113
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,680
If you'd rather just sit there
and silently judge me...

114
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,216
Oh, like you're not
doing the same thing.

115
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,152
Of course I was, Nathaniel.

116
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,871
I put you through grad school
to what? To collect rare currency?

117
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,776
Then maybe I should follow
your example, right?

118
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,757
Make a fortune wasting tax payers' cash

119
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,320
on some secret government projects
that you can't even explain.

120
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,717
It puts food on your plate.
How's that for an explanation?

121
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,996
I don't need your money.

122
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,594
As a matter of fact,

123
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,754
I don't need any of this.

124
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,040
Of course. Running away again, huh?

125
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,237
I'll see you in another two years.

126
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,996
[sighs]

127
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,273
I forgot my leftovers.

128
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,840
Nathaniel...

129
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,872
<i>Ah, poor bird
Take thy flight</i>

130
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,114
<i>High above the sorrows
Of this sad night</i>

131
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,916
Good morrow. Good morrow.

132
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,030
Not the friendliest bunch.

133
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,715
[Sara] Tone it down, Ray.
This isn't a fun time period.

134
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,235
- These hats say otherwise.
- Just try not to stand out.

135
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,199
Salem isn't exactly
welcoming of outsiders.

136
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,796
You know, just like every other
time in history.

137
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,439
They're just worse at hiding it.

138
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,955
[crowd chanting] Witch! Witch! Witch!

139
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,793
[man screams] Witch!

140
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,759
[crowd chanting] Witch! Witch! Witch!

141
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,672
Wife of Satan, confess your sins!

142
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,679
Tell now, what saw thee
for grounds of accusation?

143
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,512
I saw her, Reverend Parsons,
dancing in the woods.

144
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,440
- Bare as the day she was born.
- [crowd gasps]

145
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,798
Jane Hawthorne,
what say you to this accusation?

146
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,590
I have done no harm. I swear it.

147
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,071
But this man says he bore witness
to your witchcraft.

148
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,753
She has lain with the devil.

149
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,952
[Jane] I would never.
Not with the devil.

150
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,600
Nor with any man
since my husband's passing.

151
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,115
Much to your frustration, good sir.

152
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,296
[Reverend] Goody Hawthorne.

153
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,789
You are hereby under arrest
and accused of witchcraft!

154
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,117
Your trial will commence
on the morrow.

155
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:08,433
And if thou be convicted, we will
purge your kind from our community.

156
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,479
You cannot do this!
My daughter needs me!

157
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,789
Prudence!

158
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,800
Mother! [grunts]

159

Burn the witch!

Witch! Witch! Witch!

162
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,396
Well, there are definitely
monsters in Salem.

163
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,199
Just not the magical kind.

164

[crowd chanting] Witch! Witch! Witch!

- Witch! Witch! Witch!

166
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,477
Crows. That's ominous.

167
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,673
Despite the gothic association,

168
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,831
the American crows actually are very...

169

[screaming]

173
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,677
The witch! She commands them!

174
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,480
Remove her from here,
and let's go! Go!

[Jane struggling]

176
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,196
It couldn't have been her, could it?

177
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,476
Whatever it is,
it looks like we were right.

178
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,717
There is magic in Salem.

179
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,916
All right, let's give this thing
a whirl, shall we?

180
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,117
Gideon, do us a favor and mix us up
some ingredients

181
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,760
so I can restock
the old apothecary, will you?

182
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,320
Out of my way.
I need some mustard.

183
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,856
Yeah, yeah.
I'll be just a minute, mate.

184
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,111
Now, be a doll, Gideon, and mix together

185
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,716
a pinch of possum's tail
with three ounces of frog's testes.

[knocking on door]

187
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,350
Open the door! I need to take a leak!

[exclaims]

189
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,357
- What's that smell?
- Spell book.

190
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:54,912
Bound in human skin. It gets a bit
rank if you don't soak it in water.

191
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,718
Get out of my chair, you weasel.

192
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,154
I'm watching the football.

193
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,840
The game's on already, mate.
You want a marmite crumpet?

194
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,679
- What did you call me?
- You know,

195
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,435
you need to simmer down
a little bit, sweetheart.

196
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,638
You see, I don't like to share
my space any more than you,

197
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,351
- but here we are.
- And why are you here?

198
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,592
Hey. Sorry to break up the bonding
session, but we found our fugitive,

199
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,751
and we think it's a real witch.

200
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,878
Well, a real witch must be
off her trolley to hang around here.

201
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,555
Well, we just saw a woman command
a murder of crows,

202
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,552
and now I know why they call it that.

203
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,752
Well, Jane was bound, gagged,
and taken away.

204
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,675
Those birds were just protecting her
from that mob.

205
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,870
I say more power to them.

206
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,356
And I agree with you in theory,

207
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,160
but we still have to remove that power.

208
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,790
Gideon, what do you have
on Jane Hawthorne?

209
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,071
[Gideon] <i>On October 29th, 1692,</i>

210
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,072
<i>Jane Hawthorne's execution was
at the center</i>

211
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,391
<i>of what came to be known as
"The burning of Salem."</i>

212
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,709
[Ray] On the day she hung,

213
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,196
all of the people of Salem
spontaneously combusted.

214
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,720
The whole town was set ablaze.

215
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,320
Sounds like my kind of woman.

216
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,936
Well, the incident was enough
to convince the public

217
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,996
that witches were real.

218
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,760
Whatever it is,
Jane's at the center of it.

219
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,759
Hang on a minute.
You said that she was gagged.

220
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,435
- [Sara] Yeah.
- Did any of you actually hear her

221
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,795
cast the spell?

222
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,235
[inhales sharply] You see,
spells are a verbal game, maties.

223
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,678
Was there anyone else there?
Someone who would wanna protect Jane?

224
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,958
- Prudence.
- Her daughter.

225
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,115
A malevolent demon has attached
itself to the child,

226
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,074
and the mother is being blamed.
I've seen it a million times over.

227
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,198
Easy, peasy, lemon squeezy.
Let's get to it, shall we?

228
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,478
Well, look who's started to care.

229
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,236
But I am not wearing a costume.
I'll see you later, big man.

230
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,233
[door closes]

231
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,520
[Agent Sharpe] Gary?

232
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,200
Is that you?

233
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,320
Did you sleep walk to work again?

234
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,153
Oh, my God!

235
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,913
What is wrong with you?

236
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,390
Nate? What the hell are you doing here?

237
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,880
And why aren't you wearing pants?

238
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:12,239
I can explain. And thank you
for not mentioning the shower cap.

239
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,358
- Pretend I did.
- Coconut oil.

240
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,635
Makes my hair more buoyant.

241
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,677
- Really? I should try that.
- Mmm-hmm.

242
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,996
And the pants situation?

243
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,830
Well, I decided
to extend my trip to 2018,

244
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,913
and I may possibly be living
a little bit at the Bureau.

245
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,520
You couldn't spring for a hotel?

246
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,680
Well, here's a fun fact
about staying in the present.

247
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,074
It costs money.

248
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,516
And as a Legend, your salary is

249
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,078
the friendships you make along the way.

250
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,389
Gotcha.

251
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,120
And you?
I know you love paperwork, but...

252
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,678
Oh, yes. I'm presenting my budget

253
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,280
to the Department of Defense tomorrow.

254
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,776
Rip was always good at
schmoozing the bigwigs.

255
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,075
It was never really my thing.

256
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,719
Now, with this whole magic initiative,

257
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,280
we're gonna need even more money.

258
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,192
I can help. I'm great at schmoozing.

259

- [stammers] Oh, no, thank you.
- What? Why not?

260
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,560
I need a place to stay.
You need a wingman.

261
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,400
It'll be fun. We can hang out.
We can get into adventures...

262
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,040
Okay. Okay. You know what?
Let's do it.

263
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,117
Just put some pants on.

00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,200
You just got schmoozed.

You're strangers.

That's your monster?

It is. She protects me.

- Not at all!

- there are times the world is scary.

- Oh, my.

317
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,237
You don't want to do that.

318
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,913
And why wouldn't we?

319
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,435
Because Prudence and I share a bond.

320
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,111
If you send me to hell,
she goes right down with me.

321
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,877
These people want to send us to hell.

322
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,873
You don't want to go to hell,
do you, dearie?

323
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,960
No.

324
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,197
Would you like me to make them go away?

325
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,994
As you wish.

326

<i>We'll start with some tree roots
Up from the ground</i>

327
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,999
Prudence, you don't need her!

328
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:46,872
<i>Then summon some birds
What a beautiful sound</i>

329
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,878
Okay, you can stop singing now.

[Sara] Prudence!
You don't have to do this!

<i>I'll tell them "Attack!"
And you'll all end up...</i>

334
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,600
We're here to save your mother!

335

[Fairy Godmother]...<i>dead!</i>

336
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,710
Godmother, wait.

337
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,680
Release them.

338
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,919
As you wish.

But I'm at your call when you need me.

342
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,514
You gotta admit, though,
that was a catchy tune.

343
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,671
- [Prudence] Where am I?
- Some place safe.

344
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,837
Just until we can get you home.

345
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,757
I've seen many wonders these past days.

346
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,994
And I believe you, like Godmother,
were sent by the Lord.

347
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,150
The answer to our prayers.

348
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,915
Here. It's a donut.

349

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,599
Many wonders indeed.

352
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,274
All right, guys.
Remember the three C's of pitching.

353
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,591
Confidence, charisma...

354
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,955
Oh, crap.

355
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,400
That's my dad.

356
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,877
- Wait a second. That's your dad?
- Yeah.

357
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,736
This must be one
of the secret government projects

00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,080
he can never tell me about.

359
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,594
I can't go in there, Ava.

360
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,955
I will make this worse.

361
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,032
Come on, Nate.
You're family. How bad could it be?

362
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,919
Oh, last time I saw him,
I insulted his life's work,

363
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,515
and literally said,
"I don't need your money."

364
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,196
- Oh. Okay, that's bad.
- Mmm-hmm.

365
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,511
[Agent Sharpe] Look,
I cannot do this alone.

366
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,714
- You don't have to.
- Thank you.

367
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,256
Gary, you know
my part of the pitch, right?

368
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,158
Okay, okay. Maybe I can do this alone.

369
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,776
No, look at this guy.
He's got confidence.

370
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,393
He's got charisma. He's got...

371
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,632
Crap. I got my arm stuck
in the poster tube.

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,870
- [sighs]
- [Gary] Ah!

373
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,270
Ava, I know my dad, okay?

374
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,400
You're not gonna want to go
in there without backup.

375
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,714
Fine. Gary, you're in.

376
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,875
All right, Director Sharpe.

377
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,559
Let's give them
the old ham and eggs.

378
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,436
[sighs]

379
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,520
Damn it!

380
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,199
The Godmother was telling the truth.

381
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,239
We can't send her to hell without
sending Prudence down with her.

382
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,119
Bloody Fairy Godmothers
are like parasites

383
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,680
who feed off their hosts.

384
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,116
Their magic, it only works
at the whim of their charge.

385
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,840
The girl will have to reject
the Godmother.

386
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,639
Who's gonna give up that kind of power?

387
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,433
Especially in her situation.

388
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,951
We just have to give her what she wants.

389
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,755
If we save her mom,
she won't need the Godmother.

390
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,956
Z, we can't.

391
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,439
I checked the historical record.

392
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,831
Jane Hawthorne was executed as a witch.

393
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,558
That was canon before the Fairy
Godmother affected the timeline.

394
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,960
We can't change that.

395
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,955
So we're just gonna let them do it?

396
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,599
Sara, this is exactly what it's like
where I'm from.

397
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,279
The tribalism, scapegoating,

398
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,360
persecuting someone
just because they're different,

399
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,359
while other people just stand by
and do nothing.

400
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,016
I don't want it to go down
like this either, Z.

401
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,032
I'm sorry, but we don't have a choice.

402
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,998
Look, I promised her
that I would help her.

403
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,231
Well, you made a promise
that we can't keep.

404
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,951
The priority here is separating
Prudence from her Godmother.

405
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,600
That's how we're gonna save more lives.

406
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,560
So, in the meantime, we just let her
think we're saving her mom.

407

- [sighs]

[sword fighting in distance]

410
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,596
- I'm here to save you, Jane.
- Who art thee?

411
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,075
We need to go. Now.

412
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,440
No.

413
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,472
Look, I get that you're scared,
but I can protect you.

414
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,275
You need to trust me. Come, please.

415
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,077
I believe you mean well.

416
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,709
But I cannot go.

417
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,632
These people are insane.

418
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,240
They're gonna kill you no matter what.

419
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,680
They are afraid.

420
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,070
[Jane] And fear brings out
the worst in all of us.

421
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,831
Therefore, I must forgive them,
for they know not what they do.

422
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,634
Well, at least one of you Puritans
gets the point of that book.

423
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,995
If I disappear now,

424
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,312
others will pay for my cowardice.

425
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:58,033
And I will not allow
innocents to suffer.

426
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,032
What about your daughter's suffering?

427
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,550
Her powers.

428
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,680
Think about how your actions
are going to affect her.

429
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:08,390
She is the only one of whom I think.

430
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,437
I made her swear to me

431
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,029
that she would never use
her power henceforth.

432
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,400
As long as she heeds my command,
my Prudence will live.

433
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,878
But what kind of life is it going to be,

434
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,996
where you died
and she couldn't protect you?

435
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:30,272
That guilt is gonna follow her
her whole life.

436
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,796
She'll end up mad at herself
and mad at the world.

437
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,040
Please. We have to go.

438
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,197
My daughter is strong.

439
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:56,316
In time, with God's love,
she will let go of these burdens.

440
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,711
Jane, don't do this, please!

441

Quick! With haste!

You shall not flee
your punishment, witch!

447
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,680
Your trial awaits.

448

I know you're there, you old bat.

451
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,278
Why don't you show yourself, eh?

452
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,635
We'll have ourselves a little chat.

453
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,670
A simple "please and thank you"
would do, my pet,

454
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:42,318
[chuckles] although it has been
quite amusing watching you prattle on.

455
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,030
Yeah, yeah, yeah, all right, Granny.
You've had your fun.

456
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,191
Now it's time to let go of dear Prudence

457
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,237
and be on your merry way.

458
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,836
All I want is to make the world
a happier place.

459
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,436
And you got her mother thrown
in the bloody clink.

460
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,598
And what about that bloke
who had his eyes

461
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,114
pecked out of his skull, eh?

462
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,919
That man was a liar.

463
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,480
They're all liars!

464
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:07,315
And simple-minded pests like that
must be taught a lesson!

465
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,519
Ooh, pests. Intriguing choice of words.

466
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:16,596
Before Prudence, all the girls
I helped were just take, take, take.

467
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,792
"I want a new dress, Godmother."

468
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,111
"I want to go to the ball, Godmother."

469
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,035
So I gave and I gave,
no matter how absurd the request.

470
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,471
I mean, who would ever choose
to wear glass slippers?

471
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,199
Imagine the blisters!

472
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,398
And what did I get in return?

473
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:38,478
A thousand years locked away
in a dank and miserable dimension.

474
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:42,154
So it was humans who put you away, eh?

475
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,839
Hell, it serves you right,
you bitter old nag.

476
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,510
You don't want Prudence happy.

477
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,200
You want her raging.

478
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,751
That's how you settle the score.

479
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,071
By using a child's anger
to rain down hellfire

480
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,879
on those poor bastards out there.

481
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,720
Hellfire, you say?

482
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,992
Not a bad idea.

483
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,472
Ta-ta, my pet.

484
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,957
My Prudence will be needing me soon.

485
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,755
[sighs]

486
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,035
[Hank] And what situations require
our continued funding, Director Sharpe?

487
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,312
Sir, do you remember when dinosaurs
took over downtown Los Angeles,

488
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,593
or when a telepathic gorilla
tried to kill Barack Obama?

489
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,310
You know that I don't.

490
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,936
[Agent Sharpe] And that's
because we did our job.

491
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,256
The timeline was in complete
shambles, but I'm proud to say

492
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,840
that we finally put things
back into its proper place.

493
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,712
So, your job is done?

494
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,111
What are all these people
still doing here?

495
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,656
You see, the timeline is very fragile.

496
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,637
There's always a threat
of one kind or another.

497
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,155
And now, there's magic.

498
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:53,191
- Magic?
- Yes. You see, last year,

499
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,875
there was a time demon named Mallus.

500
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,553
Malice. But we're not gonna...

501
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,360
[Gary] And in order to kill him,
the Legends broke his prison,

502
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,635
which surprise, surprise,

503
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,599
released an unknown number
of other dangerous magical beings

504
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,400
all of whom got spat out
across the timeline

505
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,875
and now, must be hunted down
and sent to hell.

506
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,712
- Did I miss anything?
- No, actually.

507
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:18,160
You know, I've had to oversee some
really far out projects in my career.

508
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,154
But I can't, in good conscience,
have the DOD pay for a department

509
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,913
that fights fairy tales!

510
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,640
Sir, with all due respect,
you cannot shut us down. Please.

511
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,430
The damage that these supernatural
fugitives can cause is unfathomable.

512
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,796
Director Sharpe, you seem like
a very capable leader.

513
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,520
Now, you say there's magic out there.

514
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,911
And I say that I need proof.

515
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,439
- Well...
- [Gary] Here's proof.

516
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,077
- A unicorn ate my nipple!
- [gasps]

517
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,033
- Right.
- Um...

518
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,194
I'm shutting this place down.

519
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,960
Gary, put it away!

520
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,915
[Sara] Have you guys seen Z?

521
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,316
- With the witch.
- Prudence isn't a witch.

522
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,319
- Not that witches are bad.
- Prudence is alone. I just checked.

523
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,640
Gideon?

524
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,416
[Gideon] <i>Miss Tomaz gave me
explicit instructions</i>

525
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,176
<i>not to tell you
that she was leaving the ship.</i>

526
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,554
That can't be good.

527
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,472
Stay with the kid.
Don't piss her off.

528
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,318
Where the hell are you, Z?

529
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:16,154
And Io, she called upon her master

530
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,279
to set her free!

531
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:22,640
And t'were it not for these
brave men, she might've succeeded.

532
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,078
And now,

533
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,800
before your very eyes,

534
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,319
- the mark of the devil upon her flesh!
- [crowd gasping]

535
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,997
[whispering] That's
a birth mark, you jerk.

536
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:47,270
Watch now as I attempt
to draw blood from Satan's brand!

537
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,793
It will not bleed.

538
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,555
[Jane screaming]

539
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,874
[groans]

540
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,230
[exclaims]

541
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:07,115
Back! The word of God
shall be my shield!

542
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,194
[woman] The Lord has mercy!

543
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,791
[crowd exclaiming]

544
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,357
It's the witch! Stop her
before she destroys us all!

545
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,317
[Zari] Stop it! She didn't do anything!

546
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,279
[crowd exclaiming]

547
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,719
Why can't you idiots
see what he's doing?

548
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:33,714
He's convincing you to kill
your neighbors for imaginary crimes!

549
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:38,037
If you're looking for the real source
of evil in this town,

550
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,395
it's him!

551
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,633
Witch. Witch! Another witch!

552
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,675
Remove that cursed bauble from her.

553
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,470
[man] Let's stop her!

554
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,956
[choking]

555
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,792
[all choking]

556
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,236
[coughs]

557
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,159
What the hell am I doing?

558
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,158
Take her! Now!

559
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,200
I'm sorry.

560
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,280
No!

561
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,590
The Devil's hold over these witches

562
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:32,072
is stronger than we've ever faced.
Hanging them will not suffice.

563
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,110
They must burn!

564
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:40,320
[crowd shouting] Burn! Burn! Burn!

565
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,996
[straining]

566
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,720
[Fairy Godmother] <i>You feel that,
don't you, dearie?</i>

567
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,160
<i>Something is amiss.</i>

568
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,677
I worry for my mother. I thought
she'd be rescued by now.

569
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,153
It does seem odd.

570
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,039
You were promised
by those strange visitors

571
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,715
that she would be saved, were you not?

572
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,360
Curious then,
that they have not delivered.

573
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,911
Shall we see what the delay is?

574
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:09,439
- Can you do that?
- I can do anything, sweetkins.

575
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,751
All you must do is ask.

576
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,416
[Sara] According
to the historical record,

577
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,352
Jane Hawthorne was executed as a witch.

578
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,956
That was canon before the Fairy
Godmother affected the timeline.

579
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,440
We can't change that.

580
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,674
Looks like your new friends lied to you.

581
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,356
They have no intention of saving
your poor helpless mummy.

582
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,956
Now, what would you have me do
about that, my pet?

583
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,480
Oh! Prudence, hold on.

584
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,960
Out of my way, you swine.

585
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,400
[magical glissando]

[Fairy Godmother] Ta-ta.

588
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,033
Bloody hell. [chanting]

589
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,396
Shut up!

590
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,236
[muffled groaning]

591
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,590
Stay back!

592
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,669
Come, dearie.

593
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:06,636
Let's show these nasty villagers
what real magic looks like.

594
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,391
[pigs grunting]

595
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,870
Hey, how'd it go out there?

596
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,200
Well...

597
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,936
You better start packing your things

598
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,520
because he just gave
the entire Bureau an eviction notice.

599
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,976
Did you tell him
about the magical creatures?

600
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,151
Oh, yeah. He's not buying it.
He needs proof.

601
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,319
Oh, that is such a Hank thing.

602
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,400
Maybe he'll believe you,

603
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,776
why don't you just tell him
the truth?

604
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,936
Nate, it can't go worse
than what just happened back there.

605
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,776
Look, I spent my whole life trying
to convince Hank

606
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,154
that I made something of myself.

607
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,357
And most of the time,
I was faking it, okay?

608
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,512
So he's supposed to suddenly
believe I'm a superhero

609
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,398
who fought a unicorn. Come on.

610
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,393
Look, I know it's hard doing good
when it seems like no one notices,

611
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,312
but I've seen the good
that you can do, okay?

612
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,296
And that's why I believe
that you can help us here.

613
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,392
Not because you're Hank's son,
but because you... Look at me.

614
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,679
You are a hero, okay?

615
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,956
Now Gary's seeing him out.
We still have time.

616
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,516
You schmoozed me.

617
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,795
Did it work?

618
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:14,435
You sure I can't interest you
in a coffee, tea?

619
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,991
- Fizzy water?
- Just the validation.

620
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,077
I think you're doing a great job.

621

Validation.

622
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,520
Okay.

00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,713
Hello? Is anybody here?

624
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,192
Gideon. I don't have time for this.
I need proof that magic exists,

625
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,475
and I need it...

626
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,914
[pig grunts]

627
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,595
Hello, piggy. What are you doing here?

628
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,479
[Gideon] <i>I'm afraid that's
no ordinary pig, Mr. Heywood.</i>

629
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,315
Shut the front door.

630
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,800
Ray, that's you?

631
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,920
Slow down.

632
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,275
[pig grunts]

633
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,840
You got turned into a pig,

634
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,136
but you think you'll be better soon

635
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,391
because the team's working on it
as we speak?

636
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,993
Mick got turned too?
Well, where is he?

637
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,317
[pig grunts]

638
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,551
Listen, I know you're
in a situation right now.

639
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,677
But I could really use your help
at the Bureau.

640
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,073
Yes, of course, I'll carry you. Come on.

641
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,880
[crowd shouting]

642
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,640
[Reverend] In the name
of our Heavenly Father,

643
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:19,157
- let these witches burn!
- [crowd cheering]

644
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,960
Cleanse this town and its people
of this evil

645
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:27,320
and send these wretched souls
to their master in hell!

646
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,914
You don't have to listen to him!

647
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:33,109
You know this is wrong!
This woman is your neighbor!

648
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,513
Your friend! She doesn't
deserve this. No one does.

649
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:42,115
This witch is more dangerous
than any we have faced!

650
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:46,195
- She wore this cursed stone!
- [crowd gasps]

651
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:53,076
[crowd chanting] Witch! Witch! Witch!

652
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,520
[crossbow bolt whizzing]

653
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,954
Let the women go.

654
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,477
Light the pyre. Let God's work be done.

655
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,031
Do it, and he's dead.

656
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,434
My soul will live with God
for all of time.

657
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,640
Screw it.

658
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,592
[grunting]

659
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,200
No!

660
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,316
[crowd cheering]

661
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,990
Stop!

662
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,875
[magical glissando]

663
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,880
Free them from the pyre.

664
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,516
Mother! What's wrong with her?

665
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,717
- What did they do?
- She's gonna be okay.

666
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,911
Now, my pet. What shall we do
about that horrid man

667
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,276
who hurt your mummy?

668
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,319
I want him to burn.

669
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,670
[magical glissando]

670
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,200
[Nate] Hank.

671
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,718
- Are you sure this is gonna work?
- No.

672
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,474
Nathaniel? What are you doing here?

673
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:39,510
I work here. That's right, Dad.
I'm a time traveler.

674
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,115
How do you even know
about the Time Bureau?

675
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,554
What are you doing with a pig?

676
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:47,190
You want proof magic exists?
Well, here it is.

677
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,396
[pig grunts]

678
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,836
Just give me a minute.

679
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,952
[whispering] Now, Ray. Ray, do it.

680
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,157
What, no? Just come to life.

681
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,074
Prudence, listen to me.

682
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,629
This isn't who you are.
You're a good person.

683
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,595
He tried to kill my mother.

684
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,718
This town, these people.

685
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,837
They've killed so many others already.

686
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,274
They deserve to burn!

687
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:18,034
And they will pay for their ignorance
but not like that.

688
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:21,797
How else will they learn, dearie?

689
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,600
If these people aren't taught
a lesson today,

690
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:29,357
they will go and hurt others
for days and years to come.

691
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,200
You come from the future.

692
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,798
Can you honestly tell this child

693
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:38,191
that the hearts of men change
in all that time?

694
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,480
Do they?

695
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,072
No, they don't.

696
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,112
People always fear
what they don't understand.

697
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,669
And that fear turns them into monsters.

698
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:58,231
But we can't let it turn us
into monsters, too.

699
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,073
We have to be better than them.

700
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:05,754
Be better? What nonsense!
Be stronger, my pet!

701
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,911
Show them the power that you possess!

702
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:11,477
Make them grovel at your feet
where they belong!

703
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,199
Think of your mother!

704
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,994
Yes, think of your mother.

705
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,117
What would she want you to do?

706
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,989
Get blood on your hands
or forgive them?

707
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,313
"For they know not what they do."

708
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,360
Godmother...

709
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,156
Fire and brimstone, coming right...

710
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,197
I release you.

711
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,395
[gasping]

712
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,875
That's more like it.

713
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:47,272
Son, I don't know
who put you up to this but...

714
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,990
Oh, yeah. I'm also a superhero.

715
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,319
And this is my friend, Ray.

716
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,840
Oh. Hi, Mr. Heywood. Nice to
finally meet you. [clears throat]

717
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:02,836
How much money do you need
to ensure this never happens again?

718
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,350
[clears throat] 4.2 billion a year, sir.

719
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,276
Done.

720
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,636
Help!

721
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,759
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

722
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:24,430
You vile, meddling bitch!

723
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,518
[chanting]

724
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:35,912
And that is for taking my mouth,
you silly old bat.

725
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,436
I was so terrified
of losing you, Mother.

726
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,557
And I you, my sweet girl.

727
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:54,517
So what now? Am I free?

728
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:03,590
Yeah, you're free. But you're gonna
need a change of scenery.

729
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,269
Thank you.

730
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,879
Where on Earth are you taking me?

731
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,076
Oh, not on Earth, love.

732
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,629
Where I'm sending you is a touch hotter,

733
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,160
or so I hear.

734
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,232
You intend to send me to hell.

735
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,913
I could be persuaded otherwise.

736
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,030
I'm listening.

737
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,511
You need a host to conduct your magic.

738
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,479
Let's just say,
I'm in need of a miracle.

739
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,351
You want to be my new host?

740
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,875
Tit for tat, dearie.

741
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,999
[laughs]

742
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,720
John Constantine.

743
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,871
Yes, my pet. I know exactly who you are.

744
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:55,636
I know you're on the run,
and I know who's coming for you.

745
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:59,760
And believe me, I'd rather face hell
than piss him off!

746
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,791
Well, I am happy to oblige.

747
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,120
[Constantine chanting]

748
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,636
This is your last chance, Granny.

749
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:16,280
There's no helping you, dearie.

750
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,518
You're more damned than I!

751
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:23,432
Bibbity bobbity... [screams]

752
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,557
[Gideon] <i>Miss Tomaz has entered
the bridge.</i>

753
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,078
I see that, Gideon. Exit Narc mode.

754
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,640
"Narc mode."

755
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,896
You're not the only one on the ship

756
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,310
who knows how to get Gideon
to do things.

757
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,200
- I wanted to talk to you...
- You don't have to say anything.

758
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,039
I already hate myself.

759
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,597
No, it's not like that. I...

760
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,871
I understand why you did what you did.

761
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,994
I've felt that rage before, a lot.

762
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:56,880
Well, I haven't.

763
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,679
Turns out sarcasm is
a really great way to hide

764
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,070
some seriously deep-seated anger.

765
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,715
I get it.
And that's all I wanted to say,

766
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,395
is that if you wanna talk to me,
I'm here.

767
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,520
Look.

768
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:16,993
In 2018, I found my mom.

769
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:23,032
I didn't talk to her,
but she was right there and...

770
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:27,240
I couldn't think of a way to save her.

771
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,353
Yeah, it's hard.

772
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,831
I've lost a lot of people, too,
and I still think about saving them.

773
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,357
I don't think that anger ever goes away.

774
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:39,196
That's okay. You just can't hold it
in all the time.

775
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,000
I'm not really sure
what I'm supposed to do with it.

776
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,313
Well, let's figure it out, together.

777
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,350
And then we formed Voltron-Beebo

778
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:53,080
and opened a serious can
of whoop ass on Malice,

779
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,920
thus saving the universe
for the second time.

780
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:00,395
So this is what you've been doing
with your life the past two years.

781
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,836
Wow, Nathaniel. You did it.

782
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,397
You finally found a useful
application for that history degree.

783
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,280
Still not letting it go.

784
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,476
Take the win, son.

785
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,240
You've done good here.

786
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,711
I look forward to working with you.

787
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,277
- Dinner, Friday?
- Yeah.

788
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,433
Here you go. Parking is right this way.

789
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,240
Did you hear that?

790
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:30,597
That's 4.2 billion. Hell to the yes!

791
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,111
Meet me uptown, Ava Sharpe.

792
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,360
Mmm.

793
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,816
- Okay, that was terrifying.
- Yeah.

794
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,071
But clearly effective. Thank you.

795
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,152
Anytime. Always happy to help.

796
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,514
- How about tomorrow?
- Hmm?

797
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:47,631
Now that I have $4.2 billion
burning a hole in my pocket.

798
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,359
You said you could use some income.

799
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,193
I could use a guy like you around here.

800
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,269
Think about it.

801
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:01,956
Clothes. Check.
Non-cloven digits. Check.

802
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,400
Portal home.

803
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,280
Check.

804
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
After you, my friend.

805
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,360
Um...

806
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,156
You go ahead.

807
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,792
I'm gonna stick around
a little while longer,

808
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,792
give dinner with dad another go.

809
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,473
Oh. Okay. Yeah. Great.

810
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,831
So we'll see you for the next one.

811
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,276
Absolutely.

812
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,120
- Okay.
- Okay.

813
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,360
Okay.

814
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,672
