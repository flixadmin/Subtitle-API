1
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,154
My dear children.

2
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:57,951
It is now better than several years
since I moved to New York

3
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:01,121
and I haven't seen you
as much as I would like to.

4
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:06,501
I hope you will come to this
ceremony of Papal honors,

5
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,087
given for my charitable work.

6
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:13,884
The only wealth
in this world is children.

7
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:17,512
More than all the money
and power on earth,

8
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:20,390
you are my treasure.

9
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,436
Anthony and Mary,

10
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:27,939
although I entrusted your education
to your mother

11
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:29,232
for your own best interest,

12
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:35,822
I look forward to seeing you, and to
a new period of harmony in our lives.

13
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:41,912
Perhaps you might prevail upon your
mother to come to this celebration,

14
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,668
and that from time to time, we can all
see each other at family functions.

15
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:53,423
Anyway, I remain your loving father.

16
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,664
Hail Mary, full of grace...

17
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,753
...blessed art Thou amongst women...

18
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,090
...and blessed is the fruit
of Thy womb, Jesus.

19
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:41,096
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners...

20
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:12,419
Almighty God, bless the insignia
of Saint Sebastian the martyr,

21
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,546
that it may contribute

22
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:18,633
to the sacredness of him
to whom it is given.

23
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:35,192
Do you, Michael,
promise to be faithful

24
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,944
to the noble purposes of this Order,

25
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:43,575
to have a special care for the poor,
the needy and those who are ill?

26
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:45,160
I do so promise.

27
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,720
May the blessing of Almighty God,

28
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:08,892
Father, Son and Holy Spirit

29
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:14,481
descend upon you
and remain with you forever.

30
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,702
Vincent, our name is not on the list.

31
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:57,417
Write it in. Mancini. M-A-N-C-I-N-I.

32
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,921
- Problem?
- My name isn't on the list.

33
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:06,635
- Then you have to leave immediately.
- You want to dance with me?

34
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:10,013
Joe, it's Vinnie.
These are our guests.

35
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,182
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, sir.

36
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,933
Welcome to the party.

37
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:11,950
- It's good to see you.
- Good to see you. This is my husband.

38
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,660
- Sit down.
- My son, Anthony.

39
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:20,291
The Order of Saint Sebastian is one of
the highest honors the Church awards.

40
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:23,002
It was first granted by Pope...

41
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:26,089
What about Mr. Corleone's connections
with gambling?

42
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,341
The press kits have...

43
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,885
What about his involvement
with the underworld?

44
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,137
Cut the crap.

45
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,598
The Pope, the Holy Father himself,

46
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:40,770
has today blessed Michael Corleone.
Do you know better than the Pope?

47
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,524
Vincent! She loves you.

48
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:45,900
Yeah?

49
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:51,906
I love you too.

50
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,749
Hi, Vincent. I remember you.

51
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:06,796
- From where?
- The last party we were at together.

52
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:10,008
- Did you come to the club?
- No, it was a wedding.

53
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,971
I was eight and you were 15.

54
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:19,100
I had many girlfriends when I was 15.

55
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:21,394
- Eight-year-olds?
- Especially them.

56
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:24,814
Where's Mary?

57
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:30,111
Would somebody please hail Mary?
Excuse me, Your Excellency.

58
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:35,033
You haven't kissed me hello yet.
Relatives always kiss.

59
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:38,161
- Now we're related?
- I'm your little cousin.

60
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:49,506
- Who's your father?
- I'll give you a hint.

61
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:52,175
He's Italian.

62
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,678
Mary, we've been waiting for you.

63
00:09:56,429 --> 00:10:00,308
Remember to keep your voice low.

64
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:03,019
And smile. Don't forget to smile.

65
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:27,168
The honorary chairman of
the Vito Corleone Foundation,

66
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,796
my daughter, Mary Corleone.

67
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:41,099
Thanks.

68
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:47,313
I think I inherited my father's love
for speechmaking. Here it goes.

69
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:53,444
The Vito Corleone Foundation helps
the poor in every country,

70
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:57,740
gives grants to artists,
funds medical research,

71
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:02,412
and is particularly dedicated
to the resurrection of Sicily.

72
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,081
Archbishop Gilday,

73
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:10,169
here is 100 million dollars
for the poor of Sicily,

74
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,088
in the name of Vito Corleone.

75
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,716
Don't spend it all in one place.

76
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:37,238
Mary, I'm so proud of you.

77
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,497
Michael...

78
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,417
You've done a wonderful thing
for Sicily.

79
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,922
Let's hope that the money gets
to the people who need it.

80
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:55,715
Amen.

81
00:11:56,132 --> 00:12:00,929
...the most important part:
Johnny Fontane!

82
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:12,941
Thank you very much.
I'm happy to be here.

83
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:15,485
I would like you to join me
in honoring

84
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:18,196
Commendatore Michael Corleone.

85
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,828
I have something special
for our godfather.

86
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:30,625
I happen to know his favorite song.
Michael, where are you going?

87
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:33,920
I'm off to the kitchen
to hear some Tony Bennett records.

88
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:38,466
Your favorite song, "Salsiccia's Own".

89
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:40,885
I'm having a salsiccia sandwich.
I'll be back.

90
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,672
Hello, Kay.

91
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:30,810
Congratulations, Michael.
That's quite an honor.

92
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,521
But a little expensive,
wouldn't you say?

93
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:39,694
- Cake?
- No, thank you.

94
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,961
- It's been a long time, hasn't it?
- Yeah.

95
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:58,713
- Eight years.
- Yeah.

96
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:01,424
You look wonderful.

97
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:07,430
Your son has something
he wants to talk to you about.

98
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,223
I came here for him.

99
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:50,098
- What's wrong with being a lawyer?
- He wants his life to be in music.

100
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:55,978
Music is great, I love music.
But he should finish what he started.

101
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:57,605
Anthony...

102
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:00,650
- I'm going my own way.
- Your own way?

103
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,111
- Professional singer?
- Yes.

104
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:06,739
What happens if you fail?

105
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:10,034
- I won't fail.
- Men always believe that.

106
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:14,372
A law degree is like taking
out insurance.

107
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:18,751
- After that you can work for me...
- I will never work for you.

108
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,046
I have bad memories.

109
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:26,592
Every family has bad memories.

110
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,098
I'll always be your son,

111
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,600
but won't have anything to do
with your business.

112
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:40,773
Anthony... finish the law degree.

113
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:43,693
No.

114
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:05,214
Well, that he got from you. That "no".

115
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:12,930
- You could've helped me convince him.
- Convince him of what?

116
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:14,932
Of what?

117
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:20,730
He throws his life away.
He throws greatness away.

118
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:22,899
This is greatness?

119
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:28,738
Now that you're so respectable,
you're more dangerous than ever.

120
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:33,367
I preferred you when you were
just a common Mafia hood.

121
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:36,037
Okay.

122
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:40,499
- Can we talk common sense here?
- All right.

123
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,133
Tony knows that you killed Fredo.

124
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,477
- What did you come here for?
- To protect my son.

125
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:04,857
Not to see you disguised by your
church. That was a shameful ceremony.

126
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,656
I spent my life protecting my son.

127
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:16,285
I spent my life protecting my family!

128
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:17,954
Let's be reasonable, okay?

129
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:23,876
That's your big thing, isn't it,
Michael? Reason,

130
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:28,839
- backed up by murder.
- God.

131
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:33,177
- You hate me. You hate me.
- No.

132
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:35,304
I don't hate you.

133
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:38,641
I dread you.

134
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:44,480
I did what I could, Kay,

135
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:49,068
to protect all of you
from the horrors of this world.

136
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,113
But you became my horror.

137
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:05,918
The children still love you, though.
Especially Mary.

138
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,214
That's something.

139
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:16,804
We can build on that. For their sake,

140
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:21,934
let's try.

141
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:27,815
Only if you let Tony go free
to have his own life, away from you.

142
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:36,824
I'll let Tony go.

143
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,120
Thank you.

144
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,782
- Hi.
- Hi.

145
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:24,830
You could hurt somebody with those.
Let me show you around.

146
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:27,208
Can you get me an interview
with Corleone?

147
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:30,378
No. I'm a relative,
but I can't do that.

148
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:32,088
What else can I do for you?

149
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:35,800
- Handsome, but useless.
- Yeah?

150
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,886
- That's okay, I'll gamble.
- Do you like to gamble?

151
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:43,265
Let's go to Atlantic City.
I'll show you how to gamble.

152
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:45,935
How do I know what numbers to bet?

153
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,895
Do I look like a guy who's gonna lose?

154
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:49,897
Well...

155
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,776
Spooky-looking guy there.

156
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:59,698
- What's a guy like that doing here?
- That's Joey Zasa's bulldog.

157
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,784
- You know him?
- Yeah, I do.

158
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:07,081
His name is Anthony Squigilaro.
They call him "The Ant".

159
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,875
He dips his bullets in cyanide.

160
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:18,968
Two seconds... Thank you for your
contribution to the swimming-pool.

161
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:23,514
We need your help on Sam Wallace's
candidacy for judgeship.

162
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:25,599
- We can always use a good judge.
- Thanks.

163
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,351
Andrew!

164
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:31,814
My godson Andrew Hagen.
My brother Tom's eldest boy.

165
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:36,485
He's been assistant to Bishop Breelan
for three years.

166
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:40,531
- Hopes to be assigned to the Vatican.
- Rome needs fine young priests.

167
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:43,742
His mother Teresa Hagen,
Bishop Gilday.

168
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:45,953
Honored to meet you.

169
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:49,039
Mr. Corleone. Hi. Grace Hamilton.

170
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:54,837
Vincent Mancini promised to tell you
about me. That maybe you'd see me.

171
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,549
- Did Vincent Mancini call about her?
- No.

172
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:01,802
You promised to stay out there,

173
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:03,262
- twice.
- I know.

174
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:08,350
Joey Zasa showed up.
He's waiting in the lobby.

175
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:11,937
He wants to personally
congratulate you. Show his respect.

176
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:17,443
- Do I have to see him?
- He says you're his patron.

177
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,157
Hey, Vinnie!

178
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:25,784
- Who's your favorite aunt?
- You are.

179
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,916
Today I'll talk to Michael
about your little problem.

180
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:36,420
If you'd warned me,
I would have worn a better suit.

181
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:41,091
The Meucci Association has elected you

182
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:43,719
Italian-American Man of the Year.

183
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,264
Meucci...

184
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:51,810
Who's Meucci?

185
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:59,151
The Italian-American who invented
the telephone, one year before Bell.

186
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:05,908
And this is the reason
you've come today?

187
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,458
I...

188
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:20,047
I've got a stone in my shoe.

189
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:23,801
A two-bit punk who works for me.

190
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:28,097
The one who thinks
he's related to you.

191
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:31,850
A bastard.

192
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:40,317
He's here. Vincent Mancini.
He's at the party.

193
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,155
Bring him in.

194
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:49,034
I think it's good that we talk.

195
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,829
No, grazie.

196
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:55,833
I have a problem...

197
00:22:56,333 --> 00:23:02,673
...and I want to find out if it is
my problem or your problem.

198
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:07,845
Your business is your business. I have
no interests or percentages from it.

199
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:12,349
Good. Then it's my problem.

200
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:21,108
Michael, you know Vincent Mancini.
Sonny's boy.

201
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:26,238
- How are you, Mr. Corleone?
- How are you?

202
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:30,117
- Good. How are you? Good party.
- You like it?

203
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,454
- Yes, I had to sneak in.
- You're dressed for it.

204
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:42,046
So, what's the trouble
between you and Mr. Joe Zasa?

205
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:48,719
- Just trouble. I'll take care of it.
- That's foolish of you.

206
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:53,724
Foolish of me? It's a little foolish
of this guy, don't you think? Right?

207
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:58,646
- Right?
- Temper like his father...

208
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,689
Vincent...

209
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:07,905
Mr. Joe Zasa now owns what used to
be the Corleone business in New York.

210
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:12,242
Out of kindness, he gave you
a job in his family.

211
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:15,162
You took it against my advice.

212
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:20,417
I offered you something better in the
legitimate world. You turned me down.

213
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:25,422
Now you both come to me with this bad
blood. What do you expect me to do?

214
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:28,967
- Am I a gangster?
- No...

215
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:33,889
That was Papa's neighborhood.
Zasa runs it like a disgrace!

216
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:37,810
- That's the past, Connie.
- I earned that territory.

217
00:24:38,394 --> 00:24:41,814
The Commission gave it to me
and you approved.

218
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:43,190
Yes.

219
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:47,986
I came for the party, not to ask
for help. I could kill this bastard.

220
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,655
So kill him.

221
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:54,076
What does all this have to do with me?

222
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:59,581
Well, he goes behind your back,
saying "Fuck Michael Corleone".

223
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:02,167
Say it to his face, one time!

224
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:08,882
Mr. Corleone, all bastards are liars.
Shakespeare wrote poems about it.

225
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:12,010
What am I going to do with this guy?

226
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:22,938
Joey, if there's some guy
running around this city,

227
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:25,816
saying, "Fuck Michael Corleone"...

228
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:30,404
...what do we do
with a piece of shit like that?

229
00:25:32,823 --> 00:25:34,867
He's a fucking dog.

230
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:45,502
Yes, it's true.
If anyone would say such a thing,

231
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:48,839
they would not be a friend,
they would be a dog.

232
00:25:55,179 --> 00:26:01,393
- My interests don't conflict with his.
- You don't know how much they do.

233
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:03,020
Quiet, Vincent.

234
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:05,189
He needs your support!

235
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:07,983
Don't let me work for this guy,
let me work for you.

236
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:14,114
As what? Tough guy? I don't need
tough guys. I need more lawyers.

237
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:22,414
Since we have no conflicts or debts,
I accept your tribute.

238
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:23,999
I wish you well.

239
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:29,963
Vincent, make your peace
with Mr. Joe Zasa. Go on.

240
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,267
Bastardo...

241
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:51,068
Vinnie, what's the matter with you?

242
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:53,320
Get him out of here.

243
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,782
Jesus Christ...

244
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,077
I told Connie
this wasn't the right time.

245
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,161
Close it.

246
00:27:01,245 --> 00:27:05,040
I know you're into Wall Street,
but you're still the final word.

247
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:08,043
I want to protect you from these guys.
Your lawyers can't.

248
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:10,921
- But you can?
- Yeah, I can do that.

249
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,383
Why should I be afraid of Zasa?

250
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:17,928
You stop him from rising
in the Commission.

251
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:21,223
I say we make him dead.
Give me the order, I'll do it.

252
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,016
- You'll do it?
- Yeah.

253
00:27:27,688 --> 00:27:32,359
Maybe you should come with me
for a few weeks. See what happens.

254
00:27:32,943 --> 00:27:35,070
- Okay.
- See if you learn.

255
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:39,199
And we'll talk about your future.

256
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:42,744
I won't let you down.

257
00:27:49,543 --> 00:27:51,128
It's about ready.

258
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:58,510
So, what happened?

259
00:27:58,594 --> 00:27:59,887
What happened?

260
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:03,140
If I'm in a room with Zasa,
what happens? I bit his ear off.

261
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,559
Here we go. Watch the card.

262
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:09,813
Hold it!

263
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:13,859
- Vincent...
- Yeah.

264
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,028
Take the picture with us.

265
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,078
Nice jacket.

266
00:28:27,164 --> 00:28:29,583
Closer to the center, sir.

267
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:58,320
Godfather, this is the cake for you
and your family from Enzo the baker.

268
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:01,615
Do you want to do it?

269
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:50,998
Cent'anni! Cent'anni!

270
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:53,351
- Vincent?
- What do you want, sweetheart?

271
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:57,355
Do you love me?

272
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:01,401
- Come on, go to bed.
- Come on, say it.

273
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:05,322
I love you.

274
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:07,866
I love you, too.

275
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:12,162
You've got a cat?

276
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,797
Go get us some water, I'm thirsty.
Come on.

277
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:24,341
Come on.

278
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,351
Well, I guess I know my place.

279
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:38,271
I can't believe
I'm actually doing this.

280
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:42,609
"Get me water, bake me a cake"...
What happened to "please"?

281
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:33,076
Good boy, Sackface. Go for a walk.

282
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:45,422
- Let her go.
- Cut her throat, man.

283
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:51,052
- What did you say?
- Cut her fucking throat.

284
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:55,223
Okay, chief...

285
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:57,267
Drop your gun or he'll cut her throat.

286
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:01,688
I hardly know her, so cut her.
What the fuck do I care?

287
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:07,235
You've got no choice. She'll be dead.

288
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:11,323
If you do, I'll kill you both.
Give up that knife, I'll let you go.

289
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:14,117
Cut her throat! Right now!

290
00:33:14,201 --> 00:33:16,828
I'll do something
that'll convince you.

291
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:20,165
Don't get frightened. Just watch me.

292
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:26,755
Shit!

293
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,259
Drop the knife. Drop it!

294
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:33,345
Good boy.

295
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:38,225
Sit down, I want to talk to you.
It was a wise choice. Sit down.

296
00:33:38,308 --> 00:33:39,768
Lose the mask.

297
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:45,482
Relax, have a smoke. You smoke?

298
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:50,862
Whose idea was this? Who sent you?

299
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:53,240
Tell me who sent you.

300
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:59,579
- No one.
- Did you take a look at this guy?

301
00:33:59,663 --> 00:34:01,790
- Yeah.
- Who sent you?

302
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,836
It was Joey Zasa.

303
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:23,061
Are you okay?

304
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:29,567
- You were going to let them kill me!
- No, I wasn't...

305
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:32,028
You pig! You sick fuck!

306
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:37,784
You wanted gambling. That's gambling.
Call the police.

307
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:46,209
- You killed the other guy too?
- He went for my gun.

308
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,130
It was self-defense.
Go ahead, call the police.

309
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:53,466
- No, no...
- I'm taking pictures.

310
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:55,093
No pictures.

311
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:58,263
You had a gun!

312
00:34:58,555 --> 00:35:03,435
They only had a knife. You could have
handed them over to the police.

313
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:07,564
Zasa sent them.
I just sent him a message.

314
00:35:08,565 --> 00:35:13,778
- Now he has to send you one back.
- Zasa is going to send me one back?

315
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:16,698
He did the right thing.
He got Zasa's name!

316
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:20,577
What has Joey Zasa to do
with anything? Joey Zasa is a pazzo.

317
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:26,624
All right. You are what you are.

318
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:30,503
It's your nature. Stay close to me.

319
00:35:30,587 --> 00:35:34,466
Don't do anything. Keep your mouth
shut and your eyes open.

320
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:37,469
- And you do what I tell you.
- I understand.

321
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:40,972
- I have problems with the Commission.
- I know.

322
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:45,810
- You don't make them easier.
- It wasn't my idea that this happened.

323
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,230
- Get out of here.
- Michael...

324
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:51,107
Yes?

325
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:56,571
- Now they'll fear you.
- Maybe they should fear you.

326
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:04,579
- B.J., what's up?
- The Archbishop just called back.

327
00:36:10,627 --> 00:36:12,337
Don Corleone,

328
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:18,635
I need your help.
And not just to light a little candle.

329
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:27,310
My gift was to be able to persuade
people to give to the Holy Church.

330
00:36:28,478 --> 00:36:32,982
Then Rome decides to put me
in charge of the Vatican Bank...

331
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:38,071
...but I was never a true banker.

332
00:36:41,241 --> 00:36:45,412
Mea culpa. I trusted my friends.

333
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,623
Friendship and money...

334
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:51,584
Oil and water...

335
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:53,002
Indeed.

336
00:36:53,545 --> 00:37:00,427
But these "friends" used the good name
of the Church to feed their greed.

337
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:03,596
If money was lost...

338
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,183
...then I am to blame.

339
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:14,232
If only prayer could pay off
our 700 million dollar deficit.

340
00:37:16,443 --> 00:37:18,653
769 million...

341
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:29,789
The Church owns 25 percent
of a large corporation. Immobiliare.

342
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:32,625
You know the one I mean?

343
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:37,380
Largest landlord on Earth.
Real estate worth six billion dollars.

344
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:41,634
That's true.

345
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:45,805
And the Vatican vote
is necessary for control.

346
00:37:48,725 --> 00:37:51,269
No, you're mistaken.

347
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:56,274
This isn't a question of one person
deciding. One deciding vote.

348
00:37:56,357 --> 00:38:02,155
This is like any other company.
We have directors and very old rules.

349
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:07,160
The Pope himself
would have to approve you.

350
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:14,125
We've sold the casinos.

351
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:18,671
All businesses having to do
with gambling.

352
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:25,553
We have no interests or investments
in anything illegitimate.

353
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,767
The Corleones are prepared to deposit

354
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:33,228
500 million dollars
in the Vatican Bank

355
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:36,981
when Mr. Corleone receives majority
control of Immobiliare.

356
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:41,986
Immobiliare could be something new.
A European conglomerate.

357
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:47,659
Few families have control
of such a company.

358
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:53,373
It seems that, in today's world,

359
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:58,253
the power to absolve debt is greater
than the power of forgiveness.

360
00:39:00,547 --> 00:39:02,382
600 million dollars.

361
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:10,515
Don't overestimate
the power of forgiveness.

362
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:14,727
Don Corleone,

363
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:17,814
this deal with Immobiliare
can make you

364
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:19,899
one of the richest men in the world.

365
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:23,278
Your whole past history,
and the history of your family,

366
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:25,863
would be washed away.

367
00:39:29,576 --> 00:39:31,119
600 million.

368
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:54,017
The motion under discussion
relates to Corleone Group's proposal

369
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:57,478
to acquire 100,000,000 newly issued
Class A voting shares.

370
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:07,488
...Corleone capital invested directly
into International Immobiliare,

371
00:40:08,281 --> 00:40:12,452
an old and respected
European company.

372
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:18,583
Mr. Corleone has an ambitious program
to expand this real estate company

373
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:21,669
into an international conglomerate...

374
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:30,553
...by Eastern techniques of efficiency
and focus and unlimited...

375
00:40:30,637 --> 00:40:32,722
Mr. Corleone, excuse me.

376
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:36,601
Didn't you recently deposit
200 million in the Vatican Bank,

377
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:40,063
which is affiliated with Immobiliare?

378
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:41,689
True. Why not?

379
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:48,154
Wasn't there any questioning about
the timing on this particular deposit?

380
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:50,490
Mr. Chairman, if I may?

381
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:56,746
The Vito Andolini Corleone Foundation,
of which Mary Corleone is chairman,

382
00:40:56,829 --> 00:41:00,208
has made an endowment
of 100 million dollars.

383
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,543
The money comes from his own family

384
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:04,837
and will be
administered by the Vatican.

385
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:07,382
Does that answer your question?

386
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:10,218
I have always believed that

387
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:14,097
helping your fellow man
is profitable in every sense,

388
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,349
personally and bottom line.

389
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:22,814
My fellow shareholders, if Europe
and America can learn to co-operate,

390
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:27,110
if we can learn to pool our wealth,
share our markets,

391
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:31,989
we can defeat any competition
anywhere in the world.

392
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:35,368
Thank you for your time.

393
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:40,081
I hope that you will look favorably
on my proposal. Thank you.

394
00:41:46,129 --> 00:41:48,506
Let me have this microphone here.

395
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:52,093
Will we let a criminal
run our company?

396
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:54,470
He's got the map of Sicily
on his face!

397
00:41:54,554 --> 00:41:55,847
Order!

398
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:58,349
He's either a Catholic or a mafioso...

399
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:04,731
The Hamilton Investors Group
cannot support this proposal.

400
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:07,066
Your Excellency...

401
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,319
Mr. Chairman...

402
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:16,576
...the Vatican Bank feels
that International Immobiliare...

403
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:23,124
...will be safe.
In Mr. Corleone's hands.

404
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:26,294
...subject to audit
and final ratification,

405
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,254
which must take place in Rome.

406
00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:31,799
Please join me in welcoming
Mr. Michael Corleone.

407
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:52,195
Go in the other car.
I'll ride with Michael.

408
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:54,572
Go, go, go.

409
00:43:08,503 --> 00:43:13,799
As your family's oldest friend, I'm
always chosen to bring you messages.

410
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:18,763
Tell me, Don Altobello.

411
00:43:21,474 --> 00:43:26,270
Your old partners are grateful for
the money you made them.

412
00:43:26,354 --> 00:43:28,105
They worship you...

413
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:34,862
...but their hearts are broken,
because they think you abandoned them.

414
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:42,078
They want to share your deal
on Immobiliare, to be a family again.

415
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:44,455
It can purify their money.

416
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:48,543
This I cannot do.

417
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:54,465
Immobiliare must be legitimate.

418
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:58,094
I know.

419
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:01,180
But they're unhappy.

420
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:04,475
And you?

421
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:11,357
I ask nothing for myself.
Only peace in my old age.

422
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:14,860
But I must please the world around me.

423
00:44:16,696 --> 00:44:22,535
Michael, your father was
a reasonable man. Learn from him.

424
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:28,624
I learned many things from my father.

425
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:39,844
Call a meeting, my friend,
so there are no debts or grudges.

426
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:43,681
We will make the peace, you and I.

427
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:03,659
The Vatican announced today...

428
00:45:03,743 --> 00:45:07,580
that Pope Paul VI has canceled
his Sunday blessing...

429
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:09,582
due to ill health.

430
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:12,835
His physician has ordered
total bedrest...

431
00:45:12,918 --> 00:45:15,838
and cessation of all activities.

432
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:25,723
They've had a press conference.

433
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:28,934
The Pope's condition
is grave. "Gravissimo."

434
00:45:57,713 --> 00:46:01,258
The purpose of this meeting
is to ratify...

435
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:04,929
the motion passed by our
shareholders in New York.

436
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:07,973
Please...

437
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:13,771
Our group represents a consortium
of Catholic businessmen

438
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:16,691
against the Corleone control.

439
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:19,777
The Vatican has cast its vote.

440
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:22,279
Corleone Group
already controls the Board.

441
00:46:22,822 --> 00:46:27,618
According to the Lateran Treaty, the
Vatican vote must be ratified here.

442
00:46:27,702 --> 00:46:29,870
Here in Rome, by the Pope.

443
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:36,669
The Pope is gravely ill.

444
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:41,757
Until he recovers, I am powerless.

445
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:45,928
- What if he dies?
- Then...

446
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:50,141
...as you Americans say,
all bets are off.

447
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:52,518
Gentlemen, please.

448
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:57,231
This is a brief delay. Nothing more.

449
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:04,697
Your Excellency, gentlemen...

450
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:11,036
I advise you to join us in our prayers
for the Holy Father's recovery.

451
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:14,373
We had an agreement!

452
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:19,503
This meeting was to be
merely a formality.

453
00:47:19,587 --> 00:47:24,925
- Please sit down.
- I'd rather stand. Give me an answer.

454
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:30,514
The Immobiliare has its roots in the
European tradition. Please understand.

455
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:34,643
I understand.
Your tactics are despicable.

456
00:47:34,727 --> 00:47:37,897
That's quite an indictment,
coming from a Corleone.

457
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:42,359
- Gentlemen, gentlemen!
- Remember you are in the Vatican.

458
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:51,869
- What is it that you want?
- Yes, you will take control.

459
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:56,582
We'll gladly put you at the helm
of our little fleet,

460
00:47:57,082 --> 00:48:00,878
but our ships must all sail
in the same direction.

461
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:08,052
Otherwise, who can say how long
your stay with us will last?

462
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:16,143
It's not personal. It's only business.
You should know, Godfather.

463
00:48:20,189 --> 00:48:21,607
Very well.

464
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:27,780
You want to do business with me?
I will do business with you.

465
00:48:28,823 --> 00:48:30,741
Vipers, all of them.

466
00:48:36,831 --> 00:48:39,959
- We're back with the Borgias!
- Uncle Michael...

467
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:43,420
- Andrew!
- I heard you were here.

468
00:48:43,504 --> 00:48:46,966
It's so nice to see you.
Vincent, it's so nice.

469
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:51,262
What is this about the Borgias?
Those days are over.

470
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:58,602
- Recognize it?
- Yeah.

471
00:49:00,396 --> 00:49:05,067
Genco Olive Oil. That's where our
grandfather started as a delivery boy.

472
00:49:06,527 --> 00:49:08,737
Three years later he owned it.

473
00:49:08,821 --> 00:49:11,115
- Only in America.
- That's it.

474
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:17,329
Vincenzo, where have you been hiding?
We need your help so badly.

475
00:49:17,413 --> 00:49:19,039
What can I do for you?

476
00:49:19,123 --> 00:49:21,292
Get rid of Joe Zasa. He sells drugs...

477
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:26,297
Now that I'm an older woman,
I'm afraid to go out at night.

478
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,757
Where should they be now?

479
00:49:28,841 --> 00:49:31,927
- Lou, what's going on?
- We're late.

480
00:49:33,888 --> 00:49:36,682
- Have I ever let you down?
- I trust you.

481
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:39,018
- Don't worry.
- Thank you.

482
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:40,769
Enjoy yourselves.

483
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:51,363
- What was that?
- The neighborhood's in trouble.

484
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:55,242
- Do you keep an eye out for them?
- Yes.

485
00:49:55,326 --> 00:49:57,870
- And for me?
- From now on.

486
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:03,125
- I've missed you all this time.
- I missed you too, cousin.

487
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:06,128
I missed growing up with my cousins.

488
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:08,672
I didn't even know you,
but missed you.

489
00:50:09,298 --> 00:50:13,636
Do you remember stories about
our fathers? The old days?

490
00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:16,388
Yeah, what do you want to know?

491
00:50:18,766 --> 00:50:23,938
- What was Sonny like?
- Well, he was the Prince of the City.

492
00:50:25,606 --> 00:50:29,193
He died before I was born,
but I've heard a lot about him.

493
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:34,490
- What about my father?
- He's a great man.

494
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:38,410
He's a hero. He saved the family.

495
00:50:40,371 --> 00:50:42,039
- Vincent?
- What?

496
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:44,500
Did he kill his own brother?

497
00:50:48,671 --> 00:50:49,880
No.

498
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:54,218
So, it's all lies?

499
00:50:58,681 --> 00:51:01,892
Just stories, sweetheart. Okay?

500
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:07,314
Okay.

501
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:10,818
I believe you.

502
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:15,280
- I'm glad you're around.
- I'm glad you're here too.

503
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,787
Cugina...

504
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:24,081
Cous...

505
00:51:38,554 --> 00:51:41,974
I'd like to take Joey Zasa for a ride
in this and drop him.

506
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:44,476
Joey Zasa is nothing.

507
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:48,897
He's a small time enforcer.
He bluffs and threatens.

508
00:51:48,981 --> 00:51:52,776
He's nothing.
You can see him coming a mile away.

509
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:56,530
- We should kill him before he...
- No!

510
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:03,871
Never hate your enemies.
It affects your judgment.

511
00:52:20,054 --> 00:52:22,848
Nice to see you again, Mr. Corleone.

512
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:45,204
Hey, girls. Let's go.

513
00:53:03,222 --> 00:53:07,726
We trusted you to manage
our money in the casinos.

514
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:10,020
It's not even 20 years.

515
00:53:10,104 --> 00:53:13,690
You've sold the casinos
and made fortunes for all of us.

516
00:53:13,774 --> 00:53:15,776
Bravo, Don Corleone!

517
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:19,738
Thank you.

518
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:27,121
Friends, I have come here
because our business together is done.

519
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:30,833
We have prospered,

520
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:35,879
and now it is time for us to dissolve
the business relationship between us.

521
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:39,716
That's it.

522
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:42,886
But I do have a little surprise. Al?

523
00:53:45,973 --> 00:53:48,142
Your shares in the casinos.

524
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:50,644
I thought I cut through
all the red tape,

525
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:52,729
so you could get your money
right away.

526
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:01,780
50 million dollars!

527
00:54:01,864 --> 00:54:05,284
- Not everybody gets the same.
- Nothing for you...

528
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:10,414
- It depends on your investment.
- Michael, this is really generous!

529
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:12,833
Wonderful!

530
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:20,507
- Parisi, how much did you invest?
- I don't remember.

531
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:22,885
You're blessed.

532
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:32,769
My family has done much of
the hard work, taken many risks.

533
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:38,066
All to make money
for the rest of the families.

534
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:42,571
You all know Joey Zasa.

535
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:46,116
He is, I admit, an important man.

536
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:50,829
His picture is on the cover
of the New York Times magazine.

537
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:55,375
He gets the Esquire Magazine award
for the best dressed gangster.

538
00:54:56,585 --> 00:54:58,503
The newspapers praise him

539
00:54:58,587 --> 00:55:03,050
because he hires Blacks,
which shows he has a good heart.

540
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:07,346
He is famous.

541
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:14,228
Who knows? Maybe one day
he'll make all of you popular.

542
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:17,022
It's true.

543
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:22,986
I make more of a bella figura.
That is my nature.

544
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:27,950
But I also want to make a move
into legitimate enterprises.

545
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:30,911
I'd like a little pin from the Pope.

546
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:36,458
Sure, I take the Blacks
and the Spanish into my family,

547
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:40,003
because that's America.

548
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:44,049
And you guarantee
that they don't deal drugs?

549
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:50,597
I don't guarantee that. I guarantee
that I'll kill anybody who does.

550
00:55:55,185 --> 00:56:00,399
- Let me talk to him.
- Who can refuse Don Altobello?

551
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:03,110
- Joey, are you...
- No!

552
00:56:04,111 --> 00:56:09,283
I say to all of you, I have been
treated this day with no respect.

553
00:56:10,492 --> 00:56:16,123
I've earned you all money. I've made
you rich and I asked for little.

554
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:20,002
Good. You will not give, so I'll take!

555
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:23,755
As for Don Corleone,

556
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:29,928
he makes it very clear to me today
that he is my enemy.

557
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:36,184
You must choose between us.

558
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:41,857
No, Joey!

559
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:46,028
Michael, we could reason together.

560
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:48,113
No.

561
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:53,368
Michael, please... let's agree.

562
00:56:54,161 --> 00:56:56,330
He doesn't know what he's...

563
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:57,956
No, no.

564
00:57:03,003 --> 00:57:05,714
Michael, the news is everywhere.

565
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:10,677
Everyone says that you
control Immobiliare.

566
00:57:10,761 --> 00:57:15,891
Immobiliare is already laundering
money in Peru and Nassau.

567
00:57:17,225 --> 00:57:21,730
We've worked with you for 40 years.
We should wet our beaks a little.

568
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:26,568
- We want to do business with you.
- That's right, we've been together...

569
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:39,831
- It's a hit! Let's go!
- Let's get out of here! Move!

570
00:57:59,101 --> 00:58:01,728
My coat! It's my lucky coat!

571
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:04,731
It's my lucky coat!

572
00:58:10,946 --> 00:58:12,197
Stay behind me!

573
00:58:28,422 --> 00:58:30,632
Mikey, this way!

574
00:58:39,099 --> 00:58:42,352
Zasa, you son-of-a-bitch...

575
00:59:02,581 --> 00:59:04,916
Come on. We're out of here.

576
00:59:37,532 --> 00:59:39,701
- You did good, Vincent.
- Grazie.

577
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:43,455
The old Dons were pretty much
wiped out.

578
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:46,499
The survivors made deals with Zasa.

579
00:59:47,876 --> 00:59:50,462
- Altobello?
- He survived.

580
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:53,173
He's with his daughters
in Staten Island.

581
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:55,675
He says he's going
to retire in Sicily.

582
00:59:57,302 --> 01:00:01,723
Joey Zasa would never pull something
like this without the backing.

583
01:00:02,515 --> 01:00:08,438
He's just muscle. He doesn't have
the wit for that helicopter attack.

584
01:00:08,521 --> 01:00:12,734
He doesn't even have the ambition
to wipe out the whole Commission.

585
01:00:12,817 --> 01:00:15,570
I say we hit back and take Zasa out!

586
01:00:21,326 --> 01:00:24,287
Never let anyone know
what you're thinking.

587
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:34,923
Let's get a message to Joey Zasa.

588
01:00:38,218 --> 01:00:40,637
I respect what he's done.

589
01:00:41,513 --> 01:00:44,432
The new overthrows the old.
It's natural.

590
01:00:45,016 --> 01:00:47,560
How can you do business with this guy?

591
01:00:50,105 --> 01:00:54,192
I'm a businessman, first and foremost.
I want no further conflict.

592
01:00:54,276 --> 01:00:57,028
Tell him that
he can live or he can die.

593
01:00:57,112 --> 01:00:58,780
Vincent, will you shut up!

594
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:18,633
That's it.

595
01:01:20,885 --> 01:01:22,512
Joey Zasa...

596
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:25,640
He can't be doing this alone.

597
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:33,231
Just when I thought I was out,
they pull me back in.

598
01:01:41,906 --> 01:01:47,704
Our true enemy has not yet
shown his face.

599
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:53,293
Michael!

600
01:02:00,091 --> 01:02:03,553
- Has he had his medicine?
- I don't know what he took.

601
01:02:09,184 --> 01:02:11,519
- I've got my wind back.
- Call a doctor.

602
01:02:11,603 --> 01:02:13,563
- Run, run, run!
- Vincent!

603
01:02:13,688 --> 01:02:17,275
Run at thunder, girl!
Thunder can't hurt!

604
01:02:17,776 --> 01:02:19,819
Harmless noise!

605
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:25,033
Bullshit! You deceitful old fuck!

606
01:02:25,909 --> 01:02:28,536
Altobello, you fuck!

607
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:32,665
Fredo!

608
01:02:33,625 --> 01:02:35,377
Fredo!

609
01:02:58,983 --> 01:03:01,569
God! Dad!

610
01:03:04,072 --> 01:03:05,657
Excuse me.

611
01:03:06,366 --> 01:03:07,867
I'll call Kay.

612
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:22,424
- Good evening, sir.
- Can we wait here? We'll be back soon.

613
01:03:29,055 --> 01:03:34,978
Mr. Harrison, you said it was urgent.
Have you come to confess your sins?

614
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:40,358
Michael Corleone has had a diabetic
stroke. I wanted you to know about it.

615
01:03:41,025 --> 01:03:46,197
He's in a coma. I'm here to insist
the deal goes through in any event.

616
01:03:46,281 --> 01:03:48,825
The Pope has not much time left.

617
01:03:49,868 --> 01:03:53,705
So, as you,
I am in a difficult position.

618
01:03:54,038 --> 01:03:57,292
We have to ratify this deal
as soon as possible.

619
01:03:58,209 --> 01:04:01,004
- We have an understanding.
- Good.

620
01:04:02,464 --> 01:04:05,967
- I'm going to the hospital.
- I'll pray for Mr. Corleone.

621
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:14,684
- Our thoughts are with Mr. Corleone.
- Thank you, Father Jim.

622
01:04:17,187 --> 01:04:20,732
Everything will be out in the open
if Corleone dies.

623
01:04:22,317 --> 01:04:24,444
Play for time, Keinszig.

624
01:04:25,153 --> 01:04:29,616
A habit born of
a long contemplation of eternity.

625
01:04:36,623 --> 01:04:40,460
- Forget about it, Vinnie.
- Why? It's a simple hit.

626
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:46,466
I'd love to smack Joey Zasa and then
whack the fag. But it's impossible.

627
01:04:46,758 --> 01:04:52,388
He's always with people, in front of
TV cameras in his own neighborhood.

628
01:04:52,472 --> 01:04:55,058
It's not impossible.
It'll work for us.

629
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:56,142
How?

630
01:04:56,226 --> 01:05:00,355
Do you think he's going to let
Uncle Michael survive? Would you?

631
01:05:01,272 --> 01:05:03,441
He may not survive anyway.

632
01:05:04,651 --> 01:05:07,403
- How would you do it?
- I'd do it myself.

633
01:05:09,948 --> 01:05:11,282
Do it!

634
01:05:13,618 --> 01:05:16,538
- What would you need?
- A couple of guys.

635
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:49,153
Hello, Michael.

636
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:53,908
It's Kay.

637
01:05:58,997 --> 01:06:00,248
Kay...

638
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:04,752
I never expected you.

639
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:07,880
No, I know.

640
01:06:10,216 --> 01:06:11,843
But I'm here.

641
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:17,890
- I'm glad.
- You know...

642
01:06:21,394 --> 01:06:23,855
I've never seen you
looking so helpless.

643
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:30,486
It's not so bad, really.

644
01:06:32,572 --> 01:06:36,534
I feel... I'm getting wiser now.

645
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:38,953
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

646
01:06:40,246 --> 01:06:43,082
The sicker you get, the wiser you get?

647
01:06:43,166 --> 01:06:45,960
When I'm dead, I'll be really smart.

648
01:06:47,629 --> 01:06:51,758
Michael...
I want to thank you for Tony.

649
01:06:54,886 --> 01:06:58,806
He's doing really well.
He's gotten some very good notices,

650
01:06:59,432 --> 01:07:04,562
and he'll make his operatic debut in
Sicily, in Palermo this Easter, so...

651
01:07:06,606 --> 01:07:07,732
So, thank you.

652
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:12,403
That's a real honor. In Sicily.

653
01:07:17,617 --> 01:07:20,536
I will be there. I won't miss that.

654
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:23,081
I won't miss that.

655
01:07:29,545 --> 01:07:31,881
Mary, Tony...

656
01:07:33,257 --> 01:07:34,967
Go see Dad.

657
01:07:40,848 --> 01:07:44,143
- Sweetheart!
- Everything's going to be all right.

658
01:07:44,936 --> 01:07:47,355
- Tony!
- How are you doing, Pop?

659
01:07:49,982 --> 01:07:53,194
Your mother told me what happened.

660
01:07:53,277 --> 01:07:56,531
About Palermo? I hope you'll be there.

661
01:07:56,614 --> 01:07:58,783
Of course. Kiss me.

662
01:08:18,678 --> 01:08:23,182
- Cousin Vinnie?
- He's not here. Call his apartment.

663
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:27,562
- It's your cousin Mary.
- Let her in.

664
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:36,362
Hi, cous. I thought I'd drop by.
Is that okay?

665
01:08:36,446 --> 01:08:38,322
I'll get the guys.

666
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:43,411
No, it's not okay.
You shouldn't have come, Mary.

667
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:47,248
Only a couple of minutes, okay?

668
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:51,794
- You look beautiful, cous.
- Thanks.

669
01:08:54,714 --> 01:08:57,216
So this is your club, your hideout?

670
01:08:58,092 --> 01:09:00,678
- Yeah.
- I came here to check it out.

671
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:09,854
It's so strange, just me
and Aunt Connie in the house.

672
01:09:09,937 --> 01:09:14,066
- I feel better when I'm with you.
- What's wrong, sweetheart?

673
01:09:14,901 --> 01:09:17,612
- I'm scared about my father.
- Don't be.

674
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:21,574
When they took him out of
the ambulance, I thought he was dead.

675
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:24,452
Everybody says
he's going to be better.

676
01:09:26,287 --> 01:09:28,039
Don't worry.

677
01:09:28,539 --> 01:09:31,292
I remember a shooting
when I was little.

678
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:35,755
And one time Al Neri and other
bodyguards took me and Tony away.

679
01:09:38,883 --> 01:09:41,093
Is it all happening again?

680
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:44,722
Not like that, sweetie.

681
01:09:46,224 --> 01:09:49,977
Then why are you hiding here?
Is something going to happen to you?

682
01:09:51,979 --> 01:09:55,942
Nothing's going to happen
to me, cugina. We'll take care of you.

683
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:02,114
Can I stay here and hide out with you?

684
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:04,116
Can you help me cook for the boys?

685
01:10:04,617 --> 01:10:08,246
You know that I don't know
how to cook, but I'll help.

686
01:10:21,342 --> 01:10:22,677
Okay...

687
01:10:23,594 --> 01:10:25,012
What do I do?

688
01:10:57,420 --> 01:11:00,298
- I love you, cous.
- I love you, too, cous.

689
01:11:04,176 --> 01:11:05,636
Let us cook.

690
01:11:22,612 --> 01:11:24,030
Hold me.

691
01:12:00,858 --> 01:12:05,571
You in the press and the police
use words like "Mafia", "Cosa Nostra".

692
01:12:05,655 --> 01:12:07,573
This is a fantasy.

693
01:12:07,657 --> 01:12:11,077
We Italian-Americans
laid the bricks that built this city.

694
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:13,955
We have Meucci,
who invented the telephone.

695
01:12:14,038 --> 01:12:17,959
We have Don Ameche,
who played the guy who invented it.

696
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:22,797
Buy yourself a raffle ticket,
maybe you'll win a Cadillac.

697
01:12:23,506 --> 01:12:25,758
The salsiccia is wonderful!

698
01:12:25,883 --> 01:12:27,802
Here, have a sandwich.

699
01:12:40,815 --> 01:12:43,693
- Nice to see you, Mr. Zasa.
- Have a nice time.

700
01:12:45,611 --> 01:12:47,863
Don't forget to buy
your raffle tickets.

701
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:54,078
- What are you doing?
- He didn't mean it.

702
01:12:54,829 --> 01:12:57,623
- Tell him you're sorry.
- Okay, let's go.

703
01:13:16,726 --> 01:13:19,937
Joey! How are you?

704
01:13:20,021 --> 01:13:21,939
How are you, Buddy boy?

705
01:13:22,982 --> 01:13:25,943
Hey, Joey Zasa! Joey, up your ass!

706
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:31,365
- Who is this? Do you know him?
- Ignore him.

707
01:13:32,324 --> 01:13:35,453
Who's going to win the car? The Ant?

708
01:13:36,537 --> 01:13:40,708
This is what gives Italian-Americans
a bad name. A cappone like this.

709
01:13:41,167 --> 01:13:43,836
Joey, up your ass!

710
01:13:43,919 --> 01:13:47,506
Get off the car!
Do you have a raffle ticket?

711
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:50,426
Joey, take a look at my raffle ticket!

712
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:55,139
Here's what I think of you...
and your raffle ticket.

713
01:13:55,848 --> 01:13:59,435
Get the fuck off this car.
I'll break your fucking balls.

714
01:14:02,229 --> 01:14:04,023
Get out of here!

715
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:21,957
Run, Joey! You piece of shit!

716
01:14:34,929 --> 01:14:36,764
Open the door!

717
01:14:36,847 --> 01:14:38,808
How are you, Joe?

718
01:14:42,019 --> 01:14:43,312
Zasa!

719
01:15:00,830 --> 01:15:07,628
Don't ever again give that
kind of order. Not while I'm alive.

720
01:15:08,129 --> 01:15:09,130
Understand?

721
01:15:09,922 --> 01:15:11,757
I command this family!

722
01:15:12,383 --> 01:15:14,343
Right or wrong...

723
01:15:15,136 --> 01:15:18,013
...it was not what I wanted!

724
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:36,365
Do you understand?

725
01:15:43,455 --> 01:15:44,582
Yes.

726
01:15:51,255 --> 01:15:53,257
Come on, Michael.

727
01:16:04,894 --> 01:16:06,353
Yes.

728
01:16:08,439 --> 01:16:10,566
Good. Vincent.

729
01:16:19,825 --> 01:16:23,704
You know,
I always felt responsible for you.

730
01:16:24,622 --> 01:16:26,248
You know that.

731
01:16:26,957 --> 01:16:28,500
Your father...

732
01:16:29,835 --> 01:16:33,339
...my brother, we were opposites.

733
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:38,344
We would fight and argue.
But I never doubted his love.

734
01:16:38,844 --> 01:16:43,557
He would do anything for me.
But his temper...

735
01:16:46,894 --> 01:16:50,856
Too much. It clouded his reason.

736
01:16:52,358 --> 01:16:54,944
I don't want you to make that mistake.

737
01:16:57,738 --> 01:16:59,031
Also...

738
01:17:00,324 --> 01:17:02,910
...he, too, had a way with women.

739
01:17:04,828 --> 01:17:07,289
- Vincent...
- So I hear.

740
01:17:07,373 --> 01:17:09,708
What are you doing with my daughter?

741
01:17:12,586 --> 01:17:14,755
What are you doing with her?

742
01:17:19,093 --> 01:17:21,011
It's too dangerous.

743
01:17:24,098 --> 01:17:25,766
Do you hear me?

744
01:17:31,855 --> 01:17:33,065
Okay.

745
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:48,998
Vincenzo...

746
01:17:53,127 --> 01:17:57,006
When they come,
they'll come at what you love.

747
01:18:05,764 --> 01:18:08,308
Michael, you must lead another life.

748
01:18:09,184 --> 01:18:14,231
You have everything a man could
desire. It's time for you to retire.

749
01:18:15,607 --> 01:18:17,943
I have too much responsibility.

750
01:18:19,361 --> 01:18:24,950
Immobiliare? It's too difficult now.
You should really get out.

751
01:18:25,034 --> 01:18:29,747
What do you know
about those pezzi da novanta in Italy?

752
01:18:33,751 --> 01:18:37,171
I'm too old to know anything
about those new people.

753
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:41,842
I must accept my age
and grow my olives and tomatoes.

754
01:18:43,677 --> 01:18:47,056
- We're not that old.
- But you're very ill.

755
01:18:48,307 --> 01:18:52,352
Michael... Let me see
what can be done.

756
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:56,648
Let me work to make your path
a little easier.

757
01:18:57,900 --> 01:19:02,946
- Your friendship does that always.
- That makes me happy.

758
01:19:03,655 --> 01:19:07,826
Joey Zasa...
You were wrong about him.

759
01:19:08,994 --> 01:19:12,372
I trust too much.
That's always been my fault.

760
01:19:20,214 --> 01:19:23,842
Michael... treachery is everywhere.

761
01:19:24,426 --> 01:19:28,055
You still have your fingers
on the strings, even now.

762
01:19:29,932 --> 01:19:32,226
Let's see more of each other.

763
01:19:32,935 --> 01:19:37,356
- Michael, in Sicily?
- In Sicily.

764
01:19:38,315 --> 01:19:40,150
In Sicilia.

765
01:19:40,984 --> 01:19:42,361
In Sicilia.

766
01:20:30,617 --> 01:20:32,161
How are you?

767
01:20:32,953 --> 01:20:35,747
Don Bendino, my old friend.

768
01:21:07,112 --> 01:21:12,159
I brought you here, so that my old
friend and protector, Don Tommasino,

769
01:21:12,784 --> 01:21:14,328
could advise us.

770
01:21:16,163 --> 01:21:18,999
What do you think about Altobello?

771
01:21:20,209 --> 01:21:23,128
A very talented man.

772
01:21:23,503 --> 01:21:27,466
He has kept the peace between our
Sicilian and American friends.

773
01:21:28,342 --> 01:21:30,761
The saint of reason.

774
01:21:32,804 --> 01:21:36,600
A blood bath in Atlantic City
left New York a mess.

775
01:21:37,809 --> 01:21:40,270
Joey Zasa at least was running
a tight ship,

776
01:21:40,354 --> 01:21:44,191
but with him out of the picture
we must step in.

777
01:21:44,274 --> 01:21:48,070
- Step back in...
- Or the Chinese and Colombians will.

778
01:21:48,987 --> 01:21:53,867
The Corleones left drugs, so New York
is weak, and Palermo is strong.

779
01:21:55,285 --> 01:21:59,373
Your enemies always get strong
on what you leave behind.

780
01:22:02,042 --> 01:22:06,421
Who could give the order
for that massacre...

781
01:22:08,465 --> 01:22:12,219
and still pressure the Vatican deal?

782
01:22:12,386 --> 01:22:17,641
Only Lucchesi can reach
between these two worlds.

783
01:22:19,893 --> 01:22:23,188
"Our ships must all sail
in the same direction"...

784
01:22:24,982 --> 01:22:28,318
Italian politics have had these men
for centuries.

785
01:22:28,402 --> 01:22:30,821
They are the true Mafia.

786
01:22:30,904 --> 01:22:34,283
The Archbishop and the Vatican Bank,
that's the big problem.

787
01:22:34,366 --> 01:22:38,287
They're the same problem.
B.J., they're connected.

788
01:22:39,204 --> 01:22:41,915
The Archbishop has powerful friends.

789
01:22:44,626 --> 01:22:46,128
They totally protect him.

790
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:51,008
Is there someone in the
Church we can turn to?

791
01:22:51,174 --> 01:22:54,594
Someone we can tell
our problem to?

792
01:22:56,054 --> 01:22:58,056
Cardinal Lamberto.

793
01:22:58,307 --> 01:23:03,478
A wise and good man...
very influential.

794
01:23:03,979 --> 01:23:07,232
He will see you.

795
01:23:12,321 --> 01:23:17,784
I will see this Cardinal Lamberto
and see if we can work things out.

796
01:23:19,578 --> 01:23:24,082
You honor your agreements,
but you are dealing with crooks.

797
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:27,252
They have no honor.

798
01:23:29,171 --> 01:23:31,006
My word is final.

799
01:23:41,975 --> 01:23:46,188
Politics and crime,
they're the same thing.

800
01:24:08,335 --> 01:24:14,883
I've invited you all here to celebrate
my son's debut in an opera house...

801
01:24:15,425 --> 01:24:17,344
We'll play "Philadelphia".

802
01:24:18,804 --> 01:24:23,100
Seven cards. Two down, four up.
Deuces and one-eyed jacks are wild.

803
01:24:23,183 --> 01:24:25,685
...in the opera
"Cavallaria Rusticana".

804
01:24:25,769 --> 01:24:30,232
- It's "Cavalleria Rusticana, " Dad.
- "Cavalleria."

805
01:24:30,315 --> 01:24:32,818
I think I have tickets
to the wrong opera.

806
01:24:32,901 --> 01:24:34,986
I've been in New York too long.

807
01:24:35,862 --> 01:24:39,324
You will all receive tickets,
so come on time.

808
01:24:39,408 --> 01:24:41,618
Dad, I've got a present for you.

809
01:24:45,497 --> 01:24:49,626
It comes from the town of Corleone
and it's authentic Sicilian.

810
01:24:50,877 --> 01:24:53,964
And... I learned it for you.

811
01:26:23,887 --> 01:26:29,142
She was wonderful, beautiful.
I loved her. And then she died

812
01:26:30,602 --> 01:26:35,524
My trusted bodyguard
planted a bomb in my car.

813
01:26:37,442 --> 01:26:39,444
She drove it before I did.

814
01:26:41,112 --> 01:26:44,199
Why is such a beautiful country
so violent?

815
01:26:44,616 --> 01:26:46,409
History.

816
01:26:46,493 --> 01:26:50,789
Mom was telling me about when your
biggest worry was passing your exams.

817
01:26:51,081 --> 01:26:54,417
- Yes, it was then.
- I worry about you now.

818
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:59,798
Mary, you're such a
warm-hearted girl. You always were.

819
01:27:00,465 --> 01:27:03,760
- I love my family.
- Even your cousin Vincent?

820
01:27:05,095 --> 01:27:06,972
I really love him.

821
01:27:08,056 --> 01:27:11,017
- He's your first cousin.
- Then I love him first.

822
01:27:12,143 --> 01:27:14,854
Mary, you can't see him.

823
01:27:20,151 --> 01:27:24,656
- Please, promise me.
- No!

824
01:27:25,365 --> 01:27:28,660
Mary, listen to me.
You can't see him anymore.

825
01:27:28,785 --> 01:27:30,662
- Not in that fashion.
- No.

826
01:27:31,162 --> 01:27:33,248
- Obey me on this.
- No, Dad!

827
01:27:38,712 --> 01:27:42,716
Mary is smart, Dad.
She'll understand eventually.

828
01:28:05,989 --> 01:28:08,658
Bella cugina... Tesoro mio.

829
01:28:20,170 --> 01:28:22,547
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah.

830
01:28:23,506 --> 01:28:26,843
I want you to do something for me.
It's dangerous.

831
01:28:28,637 --> 01:28:31,931
Good. I'm in. What do you need?

832
01:28:32,724 --> 01:28:35,852
I want you to sell your soul
to Don Altobello.

833
01:28:36,561 --> 01:28:38,146
To betray me.

834
01:28:41,650 --> 01:28:43,610
He'd never believe me.

835
01:28:44,736 --> 01:28:46,946
- That depends.
- Sit down.

836
01:28:49,824 --> 01:28:51,493
I have an idea.

837
01:28:53,161 --> 01:28:56,665
See if you can learn
how high Altobello is connected.

838
01:29:01,002 --> 01:29:02,712
Arrange a meeting.

839
01:29:05,298 --> 01:29:09,844
You say how devoted you are to me.
Tell him your problems.

840
01:29:11,012 --> 01:29:13,973
- Ask for his help.
- What problems?

841
01:29:16,017 --> 01:29:18,853
That you want to run away
with my daughter.

842
01:29:19,604 --> 01:29:23,024
But you know that if you do,
I will become your enemy.

843
01:29:28,279 --> 01:29:31,658
- You know that I would never do that.
- I know.

844
01:29:32,867 --> 01:29:37,372
Ask Altobello to speak to me.
To further the marriage.

845
01:29:38,081 --> 01:29:42,919
But you're cousins, after all. Michael
was always a little old-fashioned.

846
01:29:44,170 --> 01:29:49,008
Say you can't belong to my legitimate
world. That you want your own family.

847
01:29:50,009 --> 01:29:53,138
I could straighten out
what Joey Zasa left behind.

848
01:29:54,889 --> 01:29:57,851
If you could use your friendship
to persuade him,

849
01:29:58,893 --> 01:30:01,771
I would be indebted to you forever.

850
01:30:03,732 --> 01:30:07,277
A Corleone knows the value
of such a friend.

851
01:30:09,028 --> 01:30:11,573
Then you would work for me?

852
01:30:12,407 --> 01:30:13,658
Sì.

853
01:30:16,286 --> 01:30:18,872
Bacio la mano, Don Altobello.

854
01:30:21,958 --> 01:30:27,005
If he hints that he wants you
to betray me, get insulted,

855
01:30:27,756 --> 01:30:29,841
because that's his trap.

856
01:30:36,473 --> 01:30:39,684
You're not telling me
the whole truth, Vincenzo.

857
01:30:42,979 --> 01:30:48,568
Isn't it true, that with Michael gone,
the girl controls everything?

858
01:30:52,906 --> 01:30:56,618
- Leave the girl out of this.
- Of course, you love her.

859
01:30:56,701 --> 01:30:58,369
And she loves you.

860
01:31:18,932 --> 01:31:22,101
I guessed it, didn't I?

861
01:31:23,728 --> 01:31:28,525
You're a wise man, Don Altobello.
I'll be learning a lot from you.

862
01:31:29,609 --> 01:31:33,238
The richest man is the one
with the most powerful friends.

863
01:31:35,657 --> 01:31:38,368
It's my duty
to make the introductions.

864
01:31:45,208 --> 01:31:47,335
Don Lucchesi.

865
01:31:49,921 --> 01:31:55,552
Don Altobello tells me that you have
a strong character. A man of respect.

866
01:31:55,635 --> 01:31:58,847
This is the hero who put
Joey Zasa in his grave.

867
01:31:59,514 --> 01:32:03,351
If we'd known of his existence,
we wouldn't have backed Joey.

868
01:32:03,852 --> 01:32:05,937
No one wants another Joe.

869
01:32:07,856 --> 01:32:10,024
Let me be your friend.

870
01:32:10,650 --> 01:32:14,821
- Even the strongest man needs friends.
- I'm flattered.

871
01:32:16,072 --> 01:32:20,743
You're a man of finance and politics.
Things I don't understand.

872
01:32:22,412 --> 01:32:26,332
You understand guns.
Finance is a gun.

873
01:32:27,542 --> 01:32:31,838
Politics is knowing
when to pull the trigger.

874
01:32:36,259 --> 01:32:37,468
How can I help?

875
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:39,929
Vieni?

876
01:32:43,016 --> 01:32:48,354
Blessed is the peacemaker,
for he can be called the child of God.

877
01:32:48,813 --> 01:32:51,566
- Tuparli Italiano un poco?
- Sì.

878
01:33:15,882 --> 01:33:18,676
The wheelchair, for Don Tommasino.

879
01:33:26,476 --> 01:33:31,272
I trusted this business arrangement
with the Archbishop. I trusted him.

880
01:33:31,356 --> 01:33:34,567
I was sure his honesty
was beyond a doubt.

881
01:33:35,568 --> 01:33:39,864
But, as you see,
I'm now the victim of a swindle.

882
01:33:40,615 --> 01:33:42,617
He's stalling me.

883
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:46,704
Vast monies have gone to
people in high political places

884
01:33:46,788 --> 01:33:49,749
and the Vatican Bank is the guarantor.

885
01:33:49,832 --> 01:33:54,837
If what you say is true,
there will be a great scandal.

886
01:33:57,048 --> 01:34:02,095
Look at this stone. It has been
in the water for a very long time,

887
01:34:02,178 --> 01:34:05,890
but the water has not penetrated it.

888
01:34:10,144 --> 01:34:11,521
Look...

889
01:34:12,647 --> 01:34:17,819
Perfectly dry. The same thing
has happened to men in Europe.

890
01:34:17,902 --> 01:34:21,823
For centuries they have been
surrounded by Christianity,

891
01:34:22,865 --> 01:34:28,705
but Christ has not penetrated.
Christ doesn't live within them.

892
01:34:32,834 --> 01:34:36,838
- What's happening?
- Could you get me something sweet?

893
01:34:36,921 --> 01:34:40,341
Some orange juice, candy...

894
01:34:44,012 --> 01:34:46,347
I have trouble with diabetes.

895
01:34:49,976 --> 01:34:52,395
My blood sugar goes low.

896
01:34:52,478 --> 01:34:54,230
I understand.

897
01:35:17,587 --> 01:35:20,465
It happens sometimes
when I'm under stress.

898
01:35:21,340 --> 01:35:22,842
I understand.

899
01:35:24,969 --> 01:35:28,848
To come to you
on such a delicate matter...

900
01:35:31,726 --> 01:35:36,147
Accusations against your Archbishop.
It was difficult for me.

901
01:35:37,857 --> 01:35:39,776
The mind suffers

902
01:35:40,151 --> 01:35:42,904
and the body cries out.

903
01:35:49,077 --> 01:35:50,745
That's true.

904
01:35:52,330 --> 01:35:56,042
Would you like to make
your confession?

905
01:36:03,007 --> 01:36:04,842
Your Eminence, I'm...

906
01:36:09,013 --> 01:36:14,519
It's been so long. I wouldn't...
I wouldn't know where to...

907
01:36:15,978 --> 01:36:17,814
It's been 30 years.

908
01:36:19,899 --> 01:36:22,527
I'd use up too much of your time,
I think.

909
01:36:23,444 --> 01:36:25,947
I always have time to save souls.

910
01:36:27,657 --> 01:36:32,203
- Well, I'm beyond redemption.
- No, no...

911
01:36:41,629 --> 01:36:45,299
I hear the confessions
of my own priests here.

912
01:36:46,717 --> 01:36:50,138
Sometimes the desire to confess
is overwhelming,

913
01:36:51,013 --> 01:36:53,224
and we must seize the moment.

914
01:36:58,062 --> 01:37:01,649
What is the point of confessing
if I don't repent?

915
01:37:04,110 --> 01:37:06,612
I hear you are a practical man.

916
01:37:07,530 --> 01:37:09,615
What have you got to lose?

917
01:37:21,419 --> 01:37:22,879
Go on.

918
01:37:29,594 --> 01:37:30,803
I...

919
01:37:32,096 --> 01:37:34,098
...betrayed my wife.

920
01:37:35,850 --> 01:37:37,310
Go on, my son.

921
01:37:42,899 --> 01:37:44,859
I betrayed myself.

922
01:37:47,904 --> 01:37:49,322
I killed men.

923
01:37:53,451 --> 01:37:55,995
And I ordered men to be killed.

924
01:37:57,413 --> 01:37:59,498
Go on, my son. Go on.

925
01:38:05,379 --> 01:38:06,839
It's useless.

926
01:38:08,883 --> 01:38:10,468
Go on, my son.

927
01:38:12,011 --> 01:38:13,346
I killed...

928
01:38:18,476 --> 01:38:21,103
I ordered the death of my brother.

929
01:38:22,063 --> 01:38:24,023
He injured me.

930
01:38:25,566 --> 01:38:27,652
I killed my mother's son.

931
01:38:29,445 --> 01:38:31,530
I killed my father's son.

932
01:38:42,208 --> 01:38:46,712
Your sins are terrible,
and it is just that you suffer.

933
01:38:48,214 --> 01:38:50,716
Your life could be redeemed,

934
01:38:51,968 --> 01:38:56,013
but I know that you don't
believe that. You will not change.

935
01:39:19,578 --> 01:39:24,458
Pope Paul VI, Supreme Pontiff
of the Roman Catholic Church.

936
01:39:24,625 --> 01:39:28,087
Died last night at 9:40 p.m.

937
01:39:28,796 --> 01:39:32,008
The Pope was 81 years old,

938
01:39:32,758 --> 01:39:38,431
and had been in poor health
for the last several months.

939
01:39:48,024 --> 01:39:49,483
Connie...

940
01:39:51,277 --> 01:39:55,781
All my life I've kept trying
to go up in society.

941
01:39:56,407 --> 01:39:59,285
To where everything higher up
was legal, straight...

942
01:40:01,412 --> 01:40:04,999
But the higher I go,
the more crooked it becomes.

943
01:40:07,710 --> 01:40:09,920
Where the hell does it end?

944
01:40:18,929 --> 01:40:22,224
They've been killing each other
for centuries here.

945
01:40:23,768 --> 01:40:27,855
For money, for pride, for family.

946
01:40:31,108 --> 01:40:35,112
To keep from becoming the slaves
of the rich pezzi da novanta.

947
01:40:42,244 --> 01:40:44,288
I made confession, Connie.

948
01:40:45,289 --> 01:40:47,375
I confessed my sins.

949
01:40:49,210 --> 01:40:51,670
Why? That's not like you.

950
01:40:51,754 --> 01:40:54,548
You don't have to confess your sins
to a stranger.

951
01:40:55,216 --> 01:40:56,675
It was the man.

952
01:40:57,718 --> 01:41:01,347
He's a good man. A true priest.

953
01:41:05,559 --> 01:41:07,645
He can change things.

954
01:41:09,939 --> 01:41:11,607
Michael...

955
01:41:13,192 --> 01:41:17,071
You know,
sometimes I think of poor Fredo.

956
01:41:17,863 --> 01:41:21,200
Drowned. It was God's will.

957
01:41:23,661 --> 01:41:25,913
It was a terrible accident.

958
01:41:27,206 --> 01:41:29,125
But it's finished.

959
01:41:34,171 --> 01:41:36,215
Michael, I love you.

960
01:41:38,467 --> 01:41:40,386
I'll always help you.

961
01:41:52,731 --> 01:41:54,150
Connie...

962
01:42:24,305 --> 01:42:31,312
I am honored, Don Altobello, that
you've come from Palermo to visit me.

963
01:42:34,482 --> 01:42:39,487
Hey, the little kid! He's grown.

964
01:42:40,237 --> 01:42:42,031
Do the donkey for me.

965
01:42:59,507 --> 01:43:03,594
It's been some time since we
did business together.

966
01:43:07,556 --> 01:43:12,561
You are my "ace in the hole,"
as we say in America.

967
01:43:12,645 --> 01:43:18,484
I have a stone in my shoe.
You can remove it.

968
01:43:25,824 --> 01:43:28,702
Only one stone?

969
01:43:30,746 --> 01:43:36,669
It's dangerous. A famous man.

970
01:43:36,752 --> 01:43:40,089
You will have to take precautions.

971
01:43:43,384 --> 01:43:48,722
Tell me what to do.
Then I will tell you my price.

972
01:43:53,018 --> 01:43:55,729
What bread!

973
01:43:59,775 --> 01:44:03,946
Olive oil...

974
01:44:07,199 --> 01:44:10,536
Virgin... only in Sicily.

975
01:44:13,038 --> 01:44:14,373
Alla salute!

976
01:44:14,456 --> 01:44:17,543
To death.

977
01:44:30,806 --> 01:44:32,308
Kay!

978
01:44:32,391 --> 01:44:34,810
- Connie!
- How are you?

979
01:44:34,893 --> 01:44:37,980
Mary, I've missed you.

980
01:44:38,397 --> 01:44:42,276
- Hello, Michael.
- Mom, look at this.

981
01:44:46,363 --> 01:44:48,782
It's too bad Douglas couldn't come.

982
01:44:48,866 --> 01:44:52,286
I know.
He had a very important trial.

983
01:44:52,369 --> 01:44:54,413
I know he wanted to come.

984
01:44:55,372 --> 01:44:57,416
- The car is...
- Okay.

985
01:44:59,376 --> 01:45:05,591
- Well, your son is an artist.
- Yes. Thanks to you.

986
01:45:06,425 --> 01:45:10,596
- What for?
- For making me let him go.

987
01:45:11,472 --> 01:45:16,310
Well, after all these years, here I am
in Sicily for the first time.

988
01:45:16,393 --> 01:45:18,604
I want to get
a picture of you together.

989
01:45:18,687 --> 01:45:19,813
Okay.

990
01:45:21,523 --> 01:45:23,484
Hey, Dad. Smile!

991
01:45:27,863 --> 01:45:30,699
I see you still have Al Neri. Why?

992
01:45:32,034 --> 01:45:35,537
I need him. He helps me
get in and out of the car.

993
01:45:36,747 --> 01:45:40,417
- He carries my briefcase.
- You're still a liar, Michael.

994
01:45:41,752 --> 01:45:45,089
Let me show you Sicily,
the real Sicily.

995
01:45:45,172 --> 01:45:48,092
So you'll understand
the family history.

996
01:45:48,175 --> 01:45:50,969
I think I understand it well enough.

997
01:47:00,539 --> 01:47:03,375
- Are they as good as they look?
- Better.

998
01:47:03,459 --> 01:47:08,005
They're the best. As long as they are
around, Uncle Michael is safe.

999
01:47:08,505 --> 01:47:10,007
Goodbye.

1000
01:47:12,468 --> 01:47:14,595
Tell your father
I'll be back for dinner.

1001
01:47:14,678 --> 01:47:15,679
Okay.

1002
01:47:16,388 --> 01:47:18,932
- Have fun.
- Tell Tony to wait for me.

1003
01:47:19,016 --> 01:47:20,601
I will.

1004
01:47:22,978 --> 01:47:26,732
Buongiorno, signora. At your service.

1005
01:47:30,694 --> 01:47:33,530
If I see Dad, I'll tell him you left.

1006
01:47:39,161 --> 01:47:42,748
You're the only one left
with my father's strength.

1007
01:47:45,042 --> 01:47:48,921
If anything happens to Michael,
I want you to strike back.

1008
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:53,842
I'll have everything ready.

1009
01:47:56,428 --> 01:47:57,971
Do you swear?

1010
01:48:06,396 --> 01:48:08,148
I swear to you.

1011
01:48:31,463 --> 01:48:33,465
You know Mary's in love.

1012
01:48:34,842 --> 01:48:36,635
Yes, I know.

1013
01:48:37,636 --> 01:48:41,682
With a handsome young Italian man
with dark eyes...

1014
01:48:43,016 --> 01:48:44,810
I won't allow it.

1015
01:48:47,813 --> 01:48:51,441
It's wrong.
It's wrong and it's dangerous.

1016
01:48:51,942 --> 01:48:54,820
"Father, my father!"

1017
01:48:55,279 --> 01:48:57,781
"Give me some time to pray
to the Lord."

1018
01:48:58,824 --> 01:49:01,660
The Baroness of Carini had
betrayed her husband...

1019
01:49:02,411 --> 01:49:05,122
and fallen in love with her cousin.

1020
01:49:05,581 --> 01:49:07,624
"There will be no forgiveness!"

1021
01:49:07,708 --> 01:49:11,169
Her father stabbed her through
the heart.

1022
01:49:23,849 --> 01:49:25,183
Honor?

1023
01:49:26,810 --> 01:49:29,187
Would it help any if I said
they were only puppets?

1024
01:49:44,745 --> 01:49:47,748
I remember the time you came
to my parents' house

1025
01:49:47,831 --> 01:49:51,585
and told me about the family business.

1026
01:49:51,668 --> 01:49:56,673
How you'd never have anything
to do with it. You sounded like Tony.

1027
01:49:57,758 --> 01:49:59,760
I was a lot like Tony.

1028
01:50:08,310 --> 01:50:11,355
Father, where are you going?

1029
01:50:21,740 --> 01:50:26,036
I know you. You're Mosca
of Montelepre.

1030
01:50:26,995 --> 01:50:30,791
You were an assassin then
and you're an assassin now.

1031
01:50:31,124 --> 01:50:34,544
I know Michael Corleone
is at your house.

1032
01:50:34,753 --> 01:50:36,797
I will pass through the gates
with you.

1033
01:50:54,022 --> 01:50:55,774
How are you?

1034
01:50:55,857 --> 01:50:59,361
This is Calo, one of my bodyguards
in the old days.

1035
01:51:05,117 --> 01:51:07,869
- We can wait here.
- You want a drink?

1036
01:51:13,458 --> 01:51:16,294
I spent a lot of time in this room...

1037
01:51:17,421 --> 01:51:19,464
...thinking of you.

1038
01:51:22,467 --> 01:51:24,678
And then you got married.

1039
01:51:28,140 --> 01:51:31,643
- I still thought of you.
- What's in that room?

1040
01:51:36,398 --> 01:51:40,068
This is dangerous for you.
This is Sicily.

1041
01:51:43,113 --> 01:51:45,407
- I love this country.
- Why?

1042
01:51:48,034 --> 01:51:51,246
Well, all through history,

1043
01:51:51,329 --> 01:51:54,040
terrible things
have happened to these people.

1044
01:51:54,958 --> 01:51:57,252
Terrible injustices.

1045
01:51:58,211 --> 01:52:03,049
But they still expect good,
rather than bad, will happen to them.

1046
01:52:03,508 --> 01:52:05,927
Sort of like me and you?

1047
01:52:09,765 --> 01:52:12,350
- How so?
- I'm still here, right?

1048
01:52:13,226 --> 01:52:14,519
We do have a bad history,

1049
01:52:15,395 --> 01:52:16,396
but I'm still here.

1050
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:19,274
Yes, you are, but with dread.

1051
01:52:22,194 --> 01:52:23,737
Give me the order!

1052
01:52:26,031 --> 01:52:28,784
Is that supposed to make me
not dread you?

1053
01:52:31,745 --> 01:52:34,039
We're in Sicily. It's opera.

1054
01:52:36,541 --> 01:52:38,084
Okay.

1055
01:52:40,629 --> 01:52:42,339
What do we do now?

1056
01:52:45,258 --> 01:52:49,095
Be reasonable.
Let's try not to hurt each other.

1057
01:52:56,937 --> 01:52:58,980
I want you to forgive me.

1058
01:53:01,733 --> 01:53:04,653
- For what?
- Everything.

1059
01:53:08,281 --> 01:53:10,450
Like God?

1060
01:53:16,122 --> 01:53:19,167
I'm not the man that you think I am.

1061
01:53:21,461 --> 01:53:22,963
Michael, what do you want
from me?

1062
01:53:26,925 --> 01:53:28,593
I love you, Kay.

1063
01:53:30,512 --> 01:53:32,639
Don't dread me anymore.

1064
01:53:38,228 --> 01:53:42,482
You know,
every night here in Sicily...

1065
01:53:43,942 --> 01:53:50,031
...I dream about my wife
and my children...

1066
01:53:52,784 --> 01:53:54,953
...and how I lost them.

1067
01:54:01,543 --> 01:54:03,378
You know what, Michael...

1068
01:54:05,964 --> 01:54:08,258
I always loved you.

1069
01:54:12,804 --> 01:54:14,598
I always will.

1070
01:54:29,654 --> 01:54:31,531
What is it? What's wrong?

1071
01:54:32,866 --> 01:54:36,411
They found Don Tommasino shot.

1072
01:54:37,162 --> 01:54:38,580
Is he dead?

1073
01:54:41,249 --> 01:54:45,003
My master is dead.
Blood calls for blood.

1074
01:54:45,086 --> 01:54:48,381
I must have revenge!

1075
01:54:51,217 --> 01:54:57,474
Some day, you may have to do
a difficult service for me.

1076
01:54:57,557 --> 01:55:00,226
Command me.

1077
01:55:00,602 --> 01:55:01,770
It never ends.

1078
01:55:02,187 --> 01:55:03,688
I will avenge him!

1079
01:55:19,245 --> 01:55:20,830
Totals...

1080
01:55:22,832 --> 01:55:25,043
Lorscheider, 1 vote.

1081
01:55:25,877 --> 01:55:28,922
Siri, 11 votes.

1082
01:55:29,839 --> 01:55:33,218
Lamberto, 99 votes.

1083
01:55:38,515 --> 01:55:44,104
Do you accept your election
as supreme pontiff?

1084
01:55:44,187 --> 01:55:50,318
God, shed light on the decision
they have taken on my behalf.

1085
01:55:50,402 --> 01:55:52,529
I accept.

1086
01:55:52,612 --> 01:55:55,573
By what name do you
wish to be called?

1087
01:55:55,657 --> 01:55:58,785
John Paul the First.

1088
01:56:28,481 --> 01:56:34,696
I will do things "right away,"
rather than in "a little while"...

1089
01:56:35,155 --> 01:56:40,076
Frederick Keinszig, known as "God's
Banker", has been reported missing.

1090
01:56:40,785 --> 01:56:47,375
He was last seen leaving the Rome
offices of Vatican owned Immobiliare.

1091
01:56:48,209 --> 01:56:51,963
Also missing was a large sum
of money and several documents.

1092
01:56:53,298 --> 01:56:55,425
Keinszig, you fool.

1093
01:56:58,595 --> 01:57:03,683
His absence casts further suspicion
on the dealings of the Vatican Bank.

1094
01:57:03,767 --> 01:57:06,811
For several years,
the bank and its companies

1095
01:57:06,895 --> 01:57:10,148
have been the object of allegations
of disreputable business practices.

1096
01:57:11,816 --> 01:57:16,446
Lucchesi, will you please
try to understand?

1097
01:57:17,572 --> 01:57:21,659
I have phoned him.
I have waited here by the phone.

1098
01:57:24,496 --> 01:57:28,333
You would do well to remember,
Mr. Lucchesi,

1099
01:57:29,542 --> 01:57:35,423
that this Pope has very different
ideas from the last one.

1100
01:57:57,695 --> 01:57:59,739
Goodbye, my old friend.

1101
01:58:02,367 --> 01:58:05,036
You could have lived a little longer.

1102
01:58:06,162 --> 01:58:08,540
I could be closer to my dream.

1103
01:58:14,963 --> 01:58:17,382
You were so loved, Don Tommasino.

1104
01:58:22,178 --> 01:58:26,057
Why was I so feared, and you so loved?

1105
01:58:27,100 --> 01:58:28,851
What was it?

1106
01:58:30,103 --> 01:58:32,105
I was no less honorable.

1107
01:58:34,232 --> 01:58:36,025
I wanted to do good.

1108
01:58:40,196 --> 01:58:43,116
What betrayed me? My mind? My heart?

1109
01:58:46,202 --> 01:58:48,746
Why do I condemn myself so?

1110
01:58:55,211 --> 01:58:57,130
I swear,

1111
01:58:57,422 --> 01:58:59,757
on the lives of my children...

1112
01:59:04,178 --> 01:59:07,015
Give me a chance to redeem myself...

1113
01:59:10,977 --> 01:59:14,522
...and I will sin no more.

1114
01:59:38,796 --> 01:59:42,675
You look pale. Bad news?
Tell me right away.

1115
01:59:44,844 --> 01:59:47,180
It's not just a bad banking deal.

1116
01:59:48,222 --> 01:59:50,350
These guys are butchers.

1117
01:59:51,601 --> 01:59:54,187
- What guys?
- Lucchesi.

1118
01:59:56,230 --> 02:00:00,068
He controls all of them:
Altobello, the Archbishop...

1119
02:00:01,819 --> 02:00:04,405
...others higher up, P2 maybe.

1120
02:00:04,489 --> 02:00:07,575
Secret unknown.
They're running things.

1121
02:00:11,287 --> 02:00:16,292
- I'm in their way.
- He's hired an assassin to kill you.

1122
02:00:16,834 --> 02:00:19,379
A Sicilian. I don't know his name.

1123
02:00:21,547 --> 02:00:23,758
But they say he never fails.

1124
02:00:25,093 --> 02:00:27,261
Then no one is safe.

1125
02:00:30,056 --> 02:00:32,266
Even the new Pope is in danger.

1126
02:00:33,351 --> 02:00:36,479
We still have time.
We can prevent this.

1127
02:00:41,984 --> 02:00:44,153
I tried, Vincent.

1128
02:00:46,364 --> 02:00:47,990
I tried...

1129
02:00:49,158 --> 02:00:53,705
...to keep everything from coming
to this. But it's not possible.

1130
02:00:55,373 --> 02:00:57,083
Not in this world.

1131
02:00:58,584 --> 02:01:00,253
Give me the order.

1132
02:01:04,340 --> 02:01:06,509
You won't be able to go back.

1133
02:01:07,552 --> 02:01:09,679
- You'll be like me.
- Good.

1134
02:01:11,389 --> 02:01:13,433
All my life I wanted out.

1135
02:01:14,308 --> 02:01:16,352
I wanted the family out.

1136
02:01:18,271 --> 02:01:20,189
I don't want out.

1137
02:01:20,648 --> 02:01:23,359
I want the power
to preserve the family.

1138
02:01:28,239 --> 02:01:30,283
I'm asking for the order.

1139
02:01:51,220 --> 02:01:53,014
It's done.

1140
02:01:54,348 --> 02:01:56,726
Because I can't do it anymore.

1141
02:02:01,022 --> 02:02:04,525
Well, it doesn't matter.
Vincent knows what to do.

1142
02:02:04,609 --> 02:02:09,614
Come on outside.
Take a rest and don't think about it.

1143
02:02:10,072 --> 02:02:12,950
- All I do is think about it.
- I'm your son.

1144
02:02:14,160 --> 02:02:16,329
Command me in all things.

1145
02:02:18,498 --> 02:02:20,374
Give up my daughter.

1146
02:02:23,461 --> 02:02:25,671
That's the price you pay...

1147
02:02:26,839 --> 02:02:29,008
...for the life you choose.

1148
02:02:55,284 --> 02:02:56,744
Nephew...

1149
02:02:59,288 --> 02:03:01,374
...from this moment on...

1150
02:03:02,625 --> 02:03:05,253
...call yourself Vincent Corleone.

1151
02:03:10,007 --> 02:03:11,300
Sit.

1152
02:03:26,315 --> 02:03:28,067
Don Vincenzo...

1153
02:03:34,073 --> 02:03:35,700
Don Corleone...

1154
02:03:39,328 --> 02:03:41,497
Don Vincenzo Corleone...

1155
02:05:15,216 --> 02:05:17,426
E tu, Vincenzo...

1156
02:05:17,510 --> 02:05:22,306
I know how you feel about Michael,
but you can't save him.

1157
02:05:23,182 --> 02:05:24,433
He's lost.

1158
02:05:26,060 --> 02:05:27,895
Think of yourself.

1159
02:05:29,063 --> 02:05:31,732
What's your answer, Vincent?

1160
02:05:33,359 --> 02:05:35,069
Enjoy the opera.

1161
02:05:37,154 --> 02:05:39,198
It's all taken care of.

1162
02:05:44,704 --> 02:05:47,456
Check the bar.
I'll check the top floor.

1163
02:05:51,127 --> 02:05:55,715
"Here's hoping Tony sings better at
the Teatro Massimo than in the shower.

1164
02:05:55,798 --> 02:05:58,134
"Love, Douglas."

1165
02:05:58,217 --> 02:06:01,470
- My darling Constanza!
- Don Altobello.

1166
02:06:02,596 --> 02:06:05,641
- This is a great occasion.
- Come, sit down.

1167
02:06:10,229 --> 02:06:14,525
Happy birthday. You're 80,
but don't look more than 60.

1168
02:06:14,608 --> 02:06:17,236
You're the only one who remembered.

1169
02:06:17,319 --> 02:06:18,946
We've just got the word.

1170
02:06:19,030 --> 02:06:22,575
The Pope has ratified
the Immobiliare deal. We've won.

1171
02:06:22,658 --> 02:06:24,285
Congratulations.

1172
02:06:27,079 --> 02:06:29,415
Strange how things work.

1173
02:06:29,498 --> 02:06:33,586
The Pope is doing what you
said he'd do. He's cleaning house.

1174
02:06:34,462 --> 02:06:38,466
He should be careful.
It's dangerous to be an honest man.

1175
02:06:44,513 --> 02:06:47,641
I want to put more muscle backstage
with Tony.

1176
02:06:59,695 --> 02:07:03,032
On your birthday you used to
shower me with treats.

1177
02:07:03,115 --> 02:07:04,950
Tootsie Rolls!

1178
02:07:05,785 --> 02:07:09,330
The nuns who made this cannoli
took a vow of silence.

1179
02:07:09,413 --> 02:07:11,290
They're the very finest.

1180
02:07:15,169 --> 02:07:17,880
- Hey.
- Hey, cous.

1181
02:07:19,924 --> 02:07:22,635
Hi. Where's your leather?

1182
02:07:26,847 --> 02:07:28,516
Stop it.

1183
02:07:34,480 --> 02:07:37,733
You're so thin. You eat it.

1184
02:07:54,333 --> 02:07:55,751
È buono.

1185
02:07:56,168 --> 02:07:58,504
Grazie!

1186
02:08:01,423 --> 02:08:05,761
It's over. There are things I have
to do that you can't be part of.

1187
02:08:05,845 --> 02:08:08,973
It's not your father's decision,
it's mine.

1188
02:08:10,683 --> 02:08:12,560
Don't hate your father.

1189
02:08:14,854 --> 02:08:18,649
There are things I'll be part of
that you can't be around.

1190
02:08:20,609 --> 02:08:23,279
After tonight,
you won't see me anymore.

1191
02:08:27,741 --> 02:08:31,287
You've got to understand, Mary.
You've got to understand.

1192
02:08:32,329 --> 02:08:33,873
I'll always love you.

1193
02:08:47,136 --> 02:08:48,929
Love somebody else.

1194
02:12:30,067 --> 02:12:34,029
- They won't try anything.
- Everything's fine. It's all clear.

1195
02:12:34,113 --> 02:12:36,907
I've already sent Al Neri
to the Vatican.

1196
02:12:49,503 --> 02:12:51,964
Mr. Lucchesi's house?

1197
02:12:52,047 --> 02:12:53,048
Yes.

1198
02:12:53,674 --> 02:12:57,928
I bring a message from
Michael Corleone.

1199
02:12:59,179 --> 02:13:00,681
Let him in.

1200
02:14:29,811 --> 02:14:31,688
Buona sera.

1201
02:17:52,681 --> 02:17:54,516
Good. You got him.

1202
02:18:46,818 --> 02:18:50,363
Tonight the Corleone family
settles its accounts.

1203
02:18:50,530 --> 02:18:55,202
Keinszig...
That little Swiss banker fuck.

1204
02:18:56,286 --> 02:19:00,248
He's been swindling everyone
from the beginning. Fuck him.

1205
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,544
Don Lucchesi, my friend

1206
02:19:04,628 --> 02:19:07,214
Calo will pay him a visit at his home.

1207
02:19:10,050 --> 02:19:13,345
Neri, take a train to Rome.

1208
02:19:14,888 --> 02:19:17,349
Light a candle for the Archbishop.

1209
02:19:53,677 --> 02:19:55,846
Tea, Your Holiness? It will help
you sleep.

1210
02:20:18,994 --> 02:20:21,997
This is from Vincent Corleone.

1211
02:21:20,180 --> 02:21:21,806
It's serious.

1212
02:21:21,890 --> 02:21:25,352
Our man inside the Vatican
says there's a plot against the Pope.

1213
02:21:25,435 --> 02:21:27,479
He'll have a heart attack?

1214
02:21:34,444 --> 02:21:39,699
This Pope has powerful enemies.
We may not be in time to save him.

1215
02:21:42,661 --> 02:21:44,371
Let's go back.

1216
02:22:18,822 --> 02:22:20,365
Eminenza...

1217
02:22:36,214 --> 02:22:38,758
The Holy Father is dead!

1218
02:24:09,349 --> 02:24:10,683
Sleep.

1219
02:24:11,476 --> 02:24:13,436
Sleep, Godfather.

1220
02:24:28,952 --> 02:24:30,537
Our friend's dead.

1221
02:25:23,590 --> 02:25:25,675
Speak... tell me.

1222
02:25:26,968 --> 02:25:33,474
You have lost the
faith of the people.

1223
02:25:34,601 --> 02:25:39,230
He who builds on the people
builds on mud.

1224
02:25:39,772 --> 02:25:43,568
And Michael Corleone's message?

1225
02:26:00,168 --> 02:26:06,549
It's very important.
I must whisper it in your ear.

1226
02:26:10,553 --> 02:26:12,555
He's clean.

1227
02:26:30,907 --> 02:26:33,952
Power wears out those
who don't have it.

1228
02:28:02,623 --> 02:28:05,793
- I like this outfit.
- I figured you would.

1229
02:28:05,877 --> 02:28:07,754
Say hello.

1230
02:28:29,776 --> 02:28:33,696
- Can I talk to you now?
- No, it's not a good time.

1231
02:28:33,780 --> 02:28:37,492
- You're just like my father.
- Stay with the family. Go on.

1232
02:28:39,118 --> 02:28:41,037
- Talk to me.
- The twins are dead.

1233
02:28:41,120 --> 02:28:45,249
In about one minute, there will be
carabinieri all over this place.

1234
02:28:46,084 --> 02:28:48,961
Get everybody to the cars, quietly.

1235
02:28:49,045 --> 02:28:50,838
- Got it.
- Quiet.

1236
02:29:05,520 --> 02:29:08,689
The name Corleone
will be associated with a voice.

1237
02:29:18,408 --> 02:29:19,784
Dad...

1238
02:29:39,429 --> 02:29:43,182
Dad... Why are you doing this to me?

1239
02:29:52,442 --> 02:29:54,902
Move back, move back.

1240
02:29:56,362 --> 02:30:00,491
- You don't have to do this to me.
- Do what? What do you mean?

1241
02:30:26,851 --> 02:30:27,852
Dad...

1242
02:30:45,203 --> 02:30:47,163
No! Mary!

1243
02:30:50,500 --> 02:30:52,001
God, no!
