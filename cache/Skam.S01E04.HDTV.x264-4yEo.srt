1
00:00:04,213 --> 00:00:06,420
Should I go find a friend?

2
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:09,067
- Could you maybe find Chris?
- Here's Chris.

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,652
- This is Chris.
- I am Chris.

4
00:00:13,024 --> 00:00:15,318
You have to get new friends.

5
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,249
- Hi! Thanks for last time.
- Hi.

6
00:00:18,295 --> 00:00:21,160
We were wondering if you
were already on a Russ bus.

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,800
Sana wants to join the bus meeting.

8
00:00:24,452 --> 00:00:26,779
We have an advantage,

9
00:00:26,852 --> 00:00:30,074
because we bought a lot of toilet paper.

10
00:00:30,694 --> 00:00:33,294
Toilet paper rolls are a waste of time.

11
00:00:33,296 --> 00:00:35,461
What should we do, then?

12
00:00:35,581 --> 00:00:37,660
Do we know any '97 guys?

13
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,780
You guys have to hook up with them.

14
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:50,473
SUNDAY, 10:00 AM

15
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,220
What are you doing?

16
00:01:13,624 --> 00:01:14,920
Good morning.

17
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,400
Did you sleep well?

18
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:19,904
No.

19
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,440
I had a nightmare.

20
00:01:23,639 --> 00:01:24,840
About what?

21
00:01:28,611 --> 00:01:31,905
I dreamed that you wore red clothes.

22
00:01:31,906 --> 00:01:34,610
You were completely drunk and sang:

23
00:01:34,644 --> 00:01:36,696
"Tonight it's allowed to be a whore."

24
00:01:37,857 --> 00:01:39,240
Really funny.

25
00:01:41,344 --> 00:01:43,680
It's you who said I should get a friend.

26
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,860
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

27
00:01:47,722 --> 00:01:49,240
So what's the problem?

28
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,383
The problem is that

29
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,725
- you don't understand Russ time is a capitalistic... 
- Bla, bla, bla.

30
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:01,640
You know Sana said I should dump you.

31
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,360
She said that?

32
00:02:05,331 --> 00:02:06,460
Yes.

33
00:02:08,238 --> 00:02:10,440
You couldn't manage
without me for one minute.

34
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,800
You couldn't, could you?

35
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:16,640
You couldn't... 

36
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:22,318
Eva?

37
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,668
- Hi!
- Hi!

38
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,240
So good to see you!

39
00:02:31,324 --> 00:02:33,887
It's certainly good to see you, too.

40
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,660
- Did you get here now?
- Yes. I got an earlier flight.

41
00:02:36,733 --> 00:02:38,344
- Were you sleeping?
- No, no!

42
00:02:39,193 --> 00:02:41,220
Should we get breakfast?

43
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,605
- Yes, we can. Are you hungry?
- Yes, I'm really hungry.

44
00:02:52,086 --> 00:02:54,746
MONDAY, 2:47 PM

45
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:59,133
Hey friend. I saw a history test

46
00:02:59,141 --> 00:03:01,900
lying on the table here
with a 3 minus. Is it recent?

47
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:05,055
Eva? I have to talk to you.

48
00:03:05,106 --> 00:03:09,090
- Yeah?
- I don't know what you think,

49
00:03:09,091 --> 00:03:12,260
but do you feel like Sana
fits in our bus group?

50
00:03:16,067 --> 00:03:18,020
Maybe she's a bit strict.

51
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,950
She asked you to break
up with your boyfriend!

52
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:25,640
But do you agree that she can't
join our bus? I talked to Chris... 

53
00:03:25,654 --> 00:03:27,500
Hey! Sana was wondering something.

54
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,346
How many rolls of
toilet paper do you have?

55
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:32,200
- ***
- Do you want to get rid of them or not?

56
00:03:34,128 --> 00:03:36,107
- Eight pallets.
- Hello!

57
00:03:38,932 --> 00:03:41,120
You said you didn't
know anyone from '97?

58
00:03:41,734 --> 00:03:43,104
I didn't.

59
00:03:43,376 --> 00:03:45,920
- He's in a bus with William.
- Is he?!

60
00:03:45,971 --> 00:03:48,580
- Who's William?
- You don't know who William is?

61
00:03:49,075 --> 00:03:50,240
No.

62
00:03:50,287 --> 00:03:53,965
He's the most handsome and coolest guy

63
00:03:53,979 --> 00:03:56,560
in all of third year.

64
00:03:56,955 --> 00:03:58,869
That is William.

65
00:04:28,872 --> 00:04:30,940
Do you follow Chris on Instagram?

66
00:04:32,722 --> 00:04:33,920
No.

67
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,960
- Do it.
- Why should I?

68
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,760
So you can get to know him.

69
00:04:38,078 --> 00:04:40,080
I have a boyfriend.

70
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,440
It's becoming a problem.

71
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,131
You don't have to hook up with him.

72
00:04:45,146 --> 00:04:47,750
Just get to know him so we can
party on the bus with William.

73
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:52,080
You can say that that
is why you're doing it.

74
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,880
Yeah, because he will
respect and accept that... 

75
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,829
- Yes! So follow him.
- Give me your phone.

76
00:04:58,926 --> 00:05:01,020
Do you know what he's called on Insta?

77
00:05:05,788 --> 00:05:07,760
Wait, that's enough.

78
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,800
When he sends you a
message, reply flirtatiously.

79
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,592
Why would he send a message?

80
00:05:12,614 --> 00:05:14,920
Just reply flirtatiously
to his message, okay?

81
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,454
- I have to go. Bye!
- Bye!

82
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:24,072
She resembles the lady
from "Åndenes makt".

83
00:05:24,093 --> 00:05:26,079
I know. She's completely raw.

84
00:05:33,206 --> 00:05:35,802
TUESDAY, 3:41 PM

85
00:05:47,751 --> 00:05:49,820
Who is Julian Dahl on Insta?

86
00:05:50,834 --> 00:05:52,225
Don't know.

87
00:05:52,734 --> 00:05:54,440
He stalks me.

88
00:05:55,724 --> 00:05:58,900
- Should we go to yours?
- No, we'll go to yours.

89
00:06:00,471 --> 00:06:03,145
Eva doesn't want to tell
her mom we're together.

90
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:04,760
Why?

91
00:06:04,815 --> 00:06:07,600
She's embarrassed of me.

92
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:10,680
I don't want her to meet you
when you're lying in my bed.

93
00:06:11,202 --> 00:06:12,822
Okay... 

94
00:06:14,529 --> 00:06:16,820
Then invite me home for
dinner together with your mom.

95
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,310
Thanks for the likes.
Never had a stalker before.

96
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,303
- Huh?
- Huh?

97
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,698
Invite me to have dinner with your mom.

98
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,992
Yeah, I'll invite you to dinner.

99
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,563
When?

100
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,858
Haha! Terrible stalker,

101
00:06:31,901 --> 00:06:33,987
be careful, I'm standing
outside your house.

102
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:35,923
- Now?
- Yeah... 

103
00:06:35,944 --> 00:06:39,100
Today, tomorrow, on
Friday, or next month?

104
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:43,479
Haha! Freaky. Now I'm actually
a little scared. And turned on.

105
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,956
Hello?

106
00:06:49,049 --> 00:06:51,440
- Friday.
- Yeah... Friday.

107
00:06:55,043 --> 00:06:56,907
Who are you texting with?

108
00:06:57,122 --> 00:06:58,434
Vilde.

109
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,556
The Russ bus boss.

110
00:07:01,373 --> 00:07:03,782
Russ bus boss? You're not on a bus.

111
00:07:03,902 --> 00:07:05,990
She is, and it's really messed up.

112
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:08,040
Stop saying that.

113
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:11,240
You said that yourself last week.

114
00:07:11,281 --> 00:07:13,619
Yeah, maybe I changed my mind.

115
00:07:14,637 --> 00:07:16,358
Yeah, maybe you did.

116
00:07:16,566 --> 00:07:18,186
Okay.

117
00:07:22,681 --> 00:07:24,976
THURSDAY, 12:10 PM

118
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,640
Guess who's invited to party
with the Penetrators guys?

119
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:31,290
Are you for real, Eva?

120
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,835
- Check it out.
- William will come... 

121
00:07:33,892 --> 00:07:37,348
That's so great, Eva! Oh my
god, you arranged this for us.

122
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,166
"Penetrator party at Borkis' on Friday."

123
00:07:40,188 --> 00:07:43,729
"Can you bring some
friends? Are they hot?"

124
00:07:44,425 --> 00:07:45,980
Yes!

125
00:07:46,847 --> 00:07:48,220
Relax.

126
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,260
Try to be cool.

127
00:07:52,188 --> 00:07:55,859
- We have to get alcohol!
- Yeah, I'll ring the beer man.

128
00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:57,820
Someone else?

129
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,840
What's wrong with the beer man?

130
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,834
Are you looking at me?
Do I look like I drink?

131
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,400
I don't drink either.

132
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,420
What an awesome gang.

133
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:10,678
- I can take some wine from my mom.
- Can you?

134
00:08:10,798 --> 00:08:14,140
Can we share? I can pay if you want.

135
00:08:14,176 --> 00:08:16,761
I can't take any from my mom.

136
00:08:16,786 --> 00:08:20,318
Her wine is so expensive.
So she puts it... 

137
00:08:20,349 --> 00:08:21,881
Stop talking.

138
00:08:25,974 --> 00:08:27,695
You talk too much.

139
00:08:28,103 --> 00:08:29,673
Excuse me?

140
00:08:38,815 --> 00:08:40,240
Seriously?

141
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:44,200
She can't be in our bus
group. She's completely psycho.

142
00:08:44,809 --> 00:08:47,104
***

143
00:08:47,362 --> 00:08:48,760
Beer man.

144
00:08:50,021 --> 00:08:51,484
Yes, please.

145
00:08:51,604 --> 00:08:55,678
We'd like some beers for four girls.

146
00:08:57,206 --> 00:08:59,407
And hundred boys!

147
00:09:01,035 --> 00:09:02,875
Do we have to pay?

148
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:07,680
If we have a friend here who's
called Vilde, if she maybe can flash?

149
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:10,740
So we don't need to pay in cash.

150
00:09:11,115 --> 00:09:13,782
Maybe we can do that... 

151
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,287
Or maybe we can get... 

152
00:09:17,407 --> 00:09:20,613
get Noora to do it.

153
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,100
No, we don't do that.

154
00:09:24,098 --> 00:09:25,553
Hello?

155
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,095
Hello?

156
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,636
Are you in prison?

157
00:09:30,657 --> 00:09:33,353
FRIDAY, 6:41 PM

158
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,255
Fuck.

159
00:10:32,234 --> 00:10:33,800
What are they doing here?

160
00:10:38,657 --> 00:10:39,984
Hi!

161
00:10:46,873 --> 00:10:49,512
Wasn't it them who threw
her out of the bus group?

162
00:10:50,129 --> 00:10:53,920
Wasn't it her who called you a slut?

163
00:10:55,929 --> 00:10:58,696
Don't go. I'll either
get assaulted by Chris,

164
00:10:58,696 --> 00:11:01,020
or killed by those girls.

165
00:11:01,034 --> 00:11:03,550
Okay. I won't leave you.

166
00:11:20,578 --> 00:11:24,035
His goal was to get a girl pregnant,

167
00:11:24,036 --> 00:11:26,736
but then he found another solution.

168
00:11:27,841 --> 00:11:31,677
You're kidding! Is that why
you're called the Penetrators?

169
00:11:34,946 --> 00:11:38,058
William asked me if I wanted
to go outside with him.

170
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:42,855
- I think we'll hook up.
- Fucking hell! Go for it, you little slut!

171
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:47,160
Little slut?

172
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,680
Yeah, she's really slutty!

173
00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:56,440
No, no! I'm slutty too.

174
00:12:13,196 --> 00:12:14,752
Hello!

175
00:12:20,509 --> 00:12:25,200
Just talk about politics
with him or something!

176
00:12:33,271 --> 00:12:34,296
JONAS: 3 missed calls.

177
00:12:34,297 --> 00:12:35,397
JONAS' TEXT MESSAGE:
What's going on with dinner?

178
00:12:39,172 --> 00:12:40,778
Hello.

179
00:12:41,466 --> 00:12:42,972
Hi.

180
00:12:44,534 --> 00:12:47,200
Are they like your crew?

181
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:49,323
My crew?

182
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,298
Are you on a Russ bus with them?

183
00:12:52,742 --> 00:12:55,897
No, I'm not on a Russ bus.

184
00:12:56,017 --> 00:12:59,339
- I'm not going to be a Russ.
- Okay?

185
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,763
I just think Russ time is really lame.

186
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,200
Great, why?

187
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:13,120
Because Russ time is capitalistic
and governed by market forces.

188
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:22,332
Great.

189
00:13:24,499 --> 00:13:27,000
You're a bit brainy.

190
00:13:27,703 --> 00:13:29,420
I like it.

191
00:13:30,312 --> 00:13:31,920
I think it's a little hot.

192
00:13:32,829 --> 00:13:34,520
You think it's hot?

193
00:13:43,993 --> 00:13:46,093
Drama!

194
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,453
I have to go.

195
00:13:58,088 --> 00:13:59,651
What's up?

196
00:14:09,373 --> 00:14:12,635
