1
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:02,009
The name
of the island they found me on

2
00:01:02,011 --> 00:01:03,711
is Lian Yu.

3
00:01:03,713 --> 00:01:07,131
It's mandarin for "purgatory."

4
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:11,135
I've been stranded here for
5 years.

5
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:14,972
I've dreamt of my rescue every
cold black night since then.

6
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:19,810
For 5 years, I have had
only one thought, one goal...

7
00:01:19,812 --> 00:01:21,729
survive...

8
00:01:23,565 --> 00:01:26,233
Survive and one day return home.

9
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:31,455
The island held many dangers.

10
00:01:31,457 --> 00:01:34,541
To live, I had to make myself
more than what I was,

11
00:01:34,543 --> 00:01:37,211
to forge myself into a weapon.

12
00:01:37,213 --> 00:01:40,214
I am returning not the boy who
was shipwrecked

13
00:01:40,216 --> 00:01:42,216
but the man who will bring
justice to those

14
00:01:42,218 --> 00:01:44,301
who have poisoned my city.

15
00:01:46,054 --> 00:01:48,555
My name is Oliver Queen.

16
00:01:54,396 --> 00:01:56,230
Oliver Queen is alive.

17
00:01:56,232 --> 00:01:59,099
The Starling City resident
was found by fishermen

18
00:01:59,101 --> 00:02:01,468
in the North China sea
5 days ago,

19
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:04,021
5 years after he was missing
and presumed dead

20
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:05,489
following the accident at sea

21
00:02:05,491 --> 00:02:07,307
which claimed
"The Queen's Gambit."

22
00:02:07,309 --> 00:02:08,809
Queen was a regular
tabloid presence

23
00:02:08,811 --> 00:02:10,661
and a fixture at
the Starling City club scene.

24
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:12,162
Shortly before
his disappearance,

25
00:02:12,164 --> 00:02:13,997
he was acquitted of assault
charges stemming

26
00:02:13,999 --> 00:02:15,866
from a highly publicized
drunken altercation

27
00:02:15,868 --> 00:02:17,418
with paparazzi.

28
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:20,704
Queen is the son of Starling
City billionaire Robert Queen,

29
00:02:20,706 --> 00:02:23,540
who was also on board but
now officially confirmed

30
00:02:23,542 --> 00:02:25,175
as deceased.

31
00:02:30,014 --> 00:02:31,548
20% of his body
is covered

32
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,050
in scar tissue.

33
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:34,518
Second-degree burns

34
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,053
on his back
and arms.

35
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:37,554
X-rays show at least
12 fractures

36
00:02:37,556 --> 00:02:39,840
that never
properly healed.

37
00:02:39,842 --> 00:02:42,860
Has he said anything
about what happened?

38
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:45,362
No. He's barely
said anything.

39
00:02:47,031 --> 00:02:49,450
Moira, I'd like
you to prepare yourself.

40
00:02:49,452 --> 00:02:52,086
The Oliver you lost
might not be

41
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:53,737
the one they found.

42
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,768
Oliver.

43
00:03:16,177 --> 00:03:18,061
Mom.

44
00:03:27,522 --> 00:03:29,055
Oh...

45
00:03:29,057 --> 00:03:31,909
My beautiful boy.

46
00:03:52,413 --> 00:03:53,847
I've got it.

47
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:57,250
Your room is exactly
as you left it.

48
00:03:57,252 --> 00:03:59,219
I never had the heart
to change a thing.

49
00:03:59,221 --> 00:04:00,587
Oliver.

50
00:04:01,756 --> 00:04:03,357
It's damn good
to see you.

51
00:04:04,893 --> 00:04:07,694
It's Walter...

52
00:04:07,696 --> 00:04:08,979
Walter Steele.

53
00:04:08,981 --> 00:04:11,031
You remember Walter,
your father's friend

54
00:04:11,033 --> 00:04:12,816
from the company.

55
00:04:17,322 --> 00:04:19,540
It's good to see
you, Raisa.

56
00:04:19,542 --> 00:04:22,326
Welcome home, Mr. Oliver.

57
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:24,962
Mr. Merlyn phoned. He wants
to join you for dinner.

58
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:26,129
Wonderful.

59
00:04:28,216 --> 00:04:29,883
Oliver?

60
00:04:29,885 --> 00:04:31,552
Did you hear that?

61
00:04:34,722 --> 00:04:36,340
Hey, sis.

62
00:04:40,628 --> 00:04:43,480
I knew it.
I knew you were alive.

63
00:04:45,567 --> 00:04:47,434
I missed you so much.

64
00:04:47,436 --> 00:04:50,821
You were with me
the whole time.

65
00:04:53,107 --> 00:04:56,360
Come on, Laurel. We're
lawyers, not miracle workers.

66
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:57,811
We can't win this.

67
00:04:57,813 --> 00:04:59,246
If we can't win
a class-action suit

68
00:04:59,248 --> 00:05:00,664
against a man who
swindled

69
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:02,082
hundreds of people out
of their homes

70
00:05:02,084 --> 00:05:03,283
and life savings,

71
00:05:03,285 --> 00:05:04,651
then we're not fit
to call ourselves

72
00:05:04,653 --> 00:05:05,819
a legal aid office.

73
00:05:05,821 --> 00:05:07,287
And if we
go bankrupt

74
00:05:07,289 --> 00:05:08,422
in the process,

75
00:05:08,424 --> 00:05:09,756
we won't be
a legal aid office.

76
00:05:09,758 --> 00:05:11,174
Hunt has an army of
lawyers, and they're

77
00:05:11,176 --> 00:05:12,509
ready to bury us.

78
00:05:12,511 --> 00:05:14,828
You and I against an army.
I love those odds.

79
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,847
Why do you
hate me?

80
00:05:23,338 --> 00:05:24,855
And in other news,

81
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:26,456
details
as to the castaway story

82
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:28,174
you've all heard about...

83
00:05:28,176 --> 00:05:29,509
the son of a very
wealthy billionaire

84
00:05:29,511 --> 00:05:32,779
will soon become
a legendary story.

85
00:05:32,781 --> 00:05:34,014
Jessica now
has more details

86
00:05:34,016 --> 00:05:35,482
and the complete
castaway story.

87
00:05:35,484 --> 00:05:36,483
"The Queen's Gambit" was

88
00:05:36,485 --> 00:05:38,535
last heard from more
than 5 years ago.

89
00:05:38,537 --> 00:05:41,071
Mr. Queen
has reportedly confirmed

90
00:05:41,073 --> 00:05:43,540
he was the only survivor
of the accident

91
00:05:43,542 --> 00:05:45,826
that took the lives of
7 people, including

92
00:05:45,828 --> 00:05:48,161
local resident Sarah Lance.

93
00:05:48,163 --> 00:05:50,797
Survived by her sister,
Laurel...

94
00:05:58,205 --> 00:05:59,640
After 5 years,

95
00:05:59,642 --> 00:06:03,877
everything that was once
familiar is now unrecognizable.

96
00:06:11,185 --> 00:06:12,769
The face I see in the mirror

97
00:06:12,771 --> 00:06:15,055
is a stranger.

98
00:06:35,177 --> 00:06:36,677
The storm's
a category 2.

99
00:06:36,679 --> 00:06:38,095
The captain's
recommending

100
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:40,430
we head back.

101
00:06:40,432 --> 00:06:41,765
All right.
Inform the crew.

102
00:06:41,767 --> 00:06:42,966
Are we in trouble?

103
00:06:42,968 --> 00:06:44,184
One of us is.

104
00:06:44,186 --> 00:06:45,802
Ollie?

105
00:06:45,804 --> 00:06:48,421
Where do you keep
the bottle opener

106
00:06:48,423 --> 00:06:49,606
on this thing?

107
00:06:49,608 --> 00:06:51,892
I'll be there in
a minute, Sarah.

108
00:06:55,064 --> 00:06:57,197
You know, son,

109
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,901
that is not
going to finish well

110
00:07:00,903 --> 00:07:03,954
for either of them
or for you.

111
00:07:07,992 --> 00:07:09,509
What did I tell you?

112
00:07:09,511 --> 00:07:10,994
Yachts suck.

113
00:07:13,998 --> 00:07:15,248
Tommy Merlyn.

114
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,551
I missed you, buddy.

115
00:07:17,553 --> 00:07:18,835
Ok. What else did
you miss?

116
00:07:18,837 --> 00:07:22,005
Super bowl winners... Giants,
Steelers, Saints, Packers,

117
00:07:22,007 --> 00:07:24,141
Giants again.

118
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:25,676
A black president,
that's new.

119
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:28,311
Oh, and "Lost," they
were all dead...

120
00:07:28,313 --> 00:07:30,564
I think.

121
00:07:30,566 --> 00:07:31,932
What was it like there?

122
00:07:35,386 --> 00:07:36,620
Cold.

123
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,972
Tomorrow, you and me,
we're doing the city.

124
00:07:38,974 --> 00:07:40,490
You've got a lot
to catch up on.

125
00:07:40,492 --> 00:07:42,359
That sounds like
a great idea.

126
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:44,494
Good. Then I was hoping
to swing by the office.

127
00:07:44,496 --> 00:07:47,114
Well, there's
plenty of time for all that.

128
00:07:47,116 --> 00:07:50,250
Queen Consolidated isn't
going anywhere.

129
00:07:50,252 --> 00:07:52,502
Oh, I am
so sorry, Mr. Oliver.

130
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,556
Dude, you speak Russian?

131
00:07:56,558 --> 00:07:58,625
I didn't realize you took
Russian at college, Oliver.

132
00:07:58,627 --> 00:08:00,010
I didn't realize

133
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:02,129
you wanted to sleep with my
mother, Walter.

134
00:08:10,004 --> 00:08:12,305
I didn't say anything.

135
00:08:12,307 --> 00:08:13,657
She didn't have to.

136
00:08:17,311 --> 00:08:18,478
Oliver...

137
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,047
Walter and I are
married,

138
00:08:21,049 --> 00:08:22,816
and I don't want you
to think

139
00:08:22,818 --> 00:08:24,517
that either one of
us did anything

140
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:26,036
to disrespect
your father.

141
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:28,188
We both believed that
Robert, like you, was,

142
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:30,173
uh, well, gone.

143
00:08:30,175 --> 00:08:32,209
It's fine.

144
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,967
May I be excused?

145
00:08:45,723 --> 00:08:48,391
Hey, don't forget
about tomorrow, buddy.

146
00:08:56,735 --> 00:09:00,403
1, 2, 3.

147
00:09:00,405 --> 00:09:01,772
It's getting closer.

148
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:04,524
That's not
very scientific.

149
00:09:04,526 --> 00:09:06,359
What would you know
about science,

150
00:09:06,361 --> 00:09:08,445
Mr. Ivy League
dropout?

151
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:09,780
I happen to know a lot
about science.

152
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:11,498
I know about
fermentation.

153
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,417
I know biology.

154
00:09:16,788 --> 00:09:18,755
Laurel's gonna kill me.

155
00:09:18,757 --> 00:09:20,123
Oh, she's so gonna kill me.

156
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:23,510
Your sister
will never know.

157
00:09:23,512 --> 00:09:24,628
Come here.

158
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,346
Ha ha!

159
00:09:26,348 --> 00:09:28,215
Ok, that one was
really close.

160
00:09:28,217 --> 00:09:31,184
Sarah, we're
gonna be fine.

161
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,979
Sarah?

162
00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:45,782
Sarah!

163
00:09:49,654 --> 00:09:52,205
Sarah!
Oliver!

164
00:09:52,207 --> 00:09:54,374
Sarah! Sarah!

165
00:09:54,376 --> 00:09:56,276
Gus?

166
00:09:59,047 --> 00:10:00,964
No! No!

167
00:10:00,966 --> 00:10:02,549
No! Dad, she's out there!

168
00:10:02,551 --> 00:10:03,917
She's not there.

169
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:05,468
Sarah!

170
00:10:08,005 --> 00:10:09,222
She's gone.

171
00:10:09,224 --> 00:10:12,058
Oliver, wake up. Oliver?

172
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,844
Oliver!

173
00:10:20,318 --> 00:10:21,601
I'm sorry. I'm so...
I'm so sorry.

174
00:10:21,603 --> 00:10:23,987
Oh, it's ok, Oliver.

175
00:10:23,989 --> 00:10:27,490
It's all right,
sweetheart.

176
00:10:27,492 --> 00:10:29,576
You're home.

177
00:10:29,578 --> 00:10:31,477
You're home.

178
00:11:02,514 --> 00:11:03,898
Where did you
get these?

179
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,484
Roxies. Thank you,
daddy's ACL tear.

180
00:11:10,372 --> 00:11:11,689
Ollie.

181
00:11:11,691 --> 00:11:13,824
No one's called me
that in a while, Speedy.

182
00:11:13,826 --> 00:11:16,026
Worst nickname ever.

183
00:11:16,028 --> 00:11:17,861
What, always chasing
after me as a kid?

184
00:11:17,863 --> 00:11:19,246
I thought it fit
pretty well.

185
00:11:19,248 --> 00:11:21,015
Maybe it still does.

186
00:11:21,017 --> 00:11:24,084
See you at school, Speedy.

187
00:11:24,086 --> 00:11:26,370
Sorry about her.

188
00:11:26,372 --> 00:11:27,755
I have something
for you.

189
00:11:27,757 --> 00:11:29,757
You did not come back
from a deserted island

190
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:31,058
with a souvenir.

191
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,709
It's a Hozen.
And in buddhism,

192
00:11:32,711 --> 00:11:34,395
it symbolizes
reconnecting.

193
00:11:34,397 --> 00:11:36,847
I kept it in hopes
that one day,

194
00:11:36,849 --> 00:11:39,716
it would reconnect
me with you.

195
00:11:41,719 --> 00:11:44,388
A rock!
That is sweet.

196
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:46,056
You know, I want
one of those

197
00:11:46,058 --> 00:11:47,825
t-shirts that says
"My friend was

198
00:11:47,827 --> 00:11:50,327
a castaway, and all I got
was this crappy shirt."

199
00:11:53,731 --> 00:11:55,749
Don't let him get you
into too much trouble.

200
00:11:55,751 --> 00:11:57,701
You just got back.
Take it slow.

201
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,173
Ahem.
The city awaits.

202
00:12:05,343 --> 00:12:08,078
Have you noticed how hot
your sister's gotten?

203
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,964
Because I have not.

204
00:12:09,966 --> 00:12:12,216
♪ it's been
a long night... ♪

205
00:12:12,218 --> 00:12:13,267
Your funeral blew.

206
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:14,768
Did you get lucky?

207
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:15,970
Fish in a barrel.

208
00:12:15,972 --> 00:12:18,922
They were so sad...

209
00:12:18,924 --> 00:12:20,140
No.
And huggy.

210
00:12:20,142 --> 00:12:21,308
And I am counting

211
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:22,526
on another target
rich environment

212
00:12:22,528 --> 00:12:23,944
for your welcome
home bash.

213
00:12:23,946 --> 00:12:25,112
At my what?

214
00:12:25,114 --> 00:12:26,864
You came back from
the dead.

215
00:12:26,866 --> 00:12:28,532
This calls for
a party.

216
00:12:28,534 --> 00:12:30,034
You tell me
where and when.

217
00:12:30,036 --> 00:12:32,036
I'll take care
of everything.

218
00:12:35,957 --> 00:12:37,291
And this city's
gone to crap.

219
00:12:37,293 --> 00:12:38,576
Your dad sold
his factory

220
00:12:38,578 --> 00:12:39,877
just in time.

221
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:41,662
And why'd you want
to drive through

222
00:12:41,664 --> 00:12:44,048
this neighborhood
anyway?

223
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:45,199
No reason.

224
00:12:45,201 --> 00:12:46,383
So what'd you miss
the most,

225
00:12:46,385 --> 00:12:47,501
steaks at the palm,

226
00:12:47,503 --> 00:12:48,752
drinks at
the station,

227
00:12:48,754 --> 00:12:49,904
meaningless sex?

228
00:12:49,906 --> 00:12:52,056
Laurel.

229
00:12:52,058 --> 00:12:55,059
Everyone is happy
you're alive.

230
00:12:55,061 --> 00:12:57,595
You want to see the
one person who isn't?

231
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:01,398
Laurel, I just got this
from Hunt's lawyers.

232
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,816
They filed
a change of venue.

233
00:13:02,818 --> 00:13:04,518
We are now in front
of Judge Grell.

234
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,020
Hunt funded Grell's
reelection campaign.

235
00:13:06,022 --> 00:13:07,187
Mm-hmm.

236
00:13:07,189 --> 00:13:08,639
He's got Grell in
his back pocket.

237
00:13:08,641 --> 00:13:10,107
You know, it's fun
being your friend.

238
00:13:10,109 --> 00:13:11,825
I get to say "I told
you so" a lot.

239
00:13:11,827 --> 00:13:13,661
No. Adam Hunt is
not smarter than we are.

240
00:13:13,663 --> 00:13:15,112
No, he's just richer
and willing to commit

241
00:13:15,114 --> 00:13:16,330
multiple felonies.

242
00:13:16,332 --> 00:13:17,831
We don't need to go
outside the law...

243
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,833
"to find justice."

244
00:13:19,835 --> 00:13:22,569
Your dad's favorite
jingle.

245
00:13:22,571 --> 00:13:24,371
Hello, Laurel.

246
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:33,047
You went to law school.
You said you would.

247
00:13:33,049 --> 00:13:36,050
Yeah. Everyone's proud.

248
00:13:37,969 --> 00:13:39,470
Adam Hunt's
a heavy hitter.

249
00:13:39,472 --> 00:13:41,188
You sure you want to get
in the ring with him?

250
00:13:42,607 --> 00:13:45,559
Five years and you want
to talk about Adam Hunt?

251
00:13:45,561 --> 00:13:49,063
No. Not really.

252
00:13:49,065 --> 00:13:52,066
Why are you here, Ollie?

253
00:13:52,068 --> 00:13:53,484
To apologize.

254
00:13:53,486 --> 00:13:55,486
It was my fault.

255
00:13:55,488 --> 00:13:59,073
I wanted to ask you
not to blame her.

256
00:13:59,075 --> 00:14:00,524
For what?

257
00:14:00,526 --> 00:14:02,076
Falling under your spell.

258
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:04,861
How could I possibly blame
her for doing the same things

259
00:14:04,863 --> 00:14:06,080
that I did?

260
00:14:06,082 --> 00:14:07,414
I never meant to...

261
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:09,866
She was my sister.

262
00:14:09,868 --> 00:14:11,719
I couldn't be angry

263
00:14:11,721 --> 00:14:13,837
because she was dead.

264
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,506
I couldn't grieve because
I was so angry.

265
00:14:15,508 --> 00:14:17,091
That's what happens when
your sister dies

266
00:14:17,093 --> 00:14:18,726
while screwing
your boyfriend.

267
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:23,714
We buried an empty coffin...

268
00:14:26,351 --> 00:14:28,051
Because her body was at
the bottom of the ocean

269
00:14:28,053 --> 00:14:30,404
where you left her.

270
00:14:32,407 --> 00:14:34,375
It should have been you.

271
00:14:36,361 --> 00:14:38,061
I know that it's too
late to say this,

272
00:14:38,063 --> 00:14:39,663
but I'm sorry.

273
00:14:40,832 --> 00:14:43,534
Yeah, I'm sorry, too.

274
00:14:43,536 --> 00:14:46,170
I'd hoped that you'd rot
in hell a whole lot longer

275
00:14:46,172 --> 00:14:47,904
than 5 years.

276
00:14:50,642 --> 00:14:53,043
How did you think that
was gonna go, Tommy?

277
00:14:54,379 --> 00:14:56,079
About like that.

278
00:14:57,248 --> 00:14:59,133
Ok, so we took care
of that. Good call.

279
00:14:59,135 --> 00:15:00,634
Now we can make up
for lost time.

280
00:15:00,636 --> 00:15:02,136
If you're not
too sick of fish,

281
00:15:02,138 --> 00:15:03,637
I suggest we find
some leggy models

282
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:05,589
and eat Sushi all
day. What do you say?

283
00:15:05,591 --> 00:15:08,108
What're they doing?
What the hell?

284
00:15:11,563 --> 00:15:13,363
Hey!

285
00:15:22,992 --> 00:15:25,125
Here, son. Drink.

286
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,380
What the hell
are you doing?!

287
00:15:30,382 --> 00:15:31,582
That's all
we've got.

288
00:15:31,584 --> 00:15:32,916
If anybody's making it
out of here,

289
00:15:32,918 --> 00:15:34,334
it's gonna be him.

290
00:15:36,755 --> 00:15:39,473
I'm so sorry. I thought
I'd have more time.

291
00:15:39,475 --> 00:15:41,475
I'm not the man you
think I am.

292
00:15:43,344 --> 00:15:45,262
I didn't build
our city.

293
00:15:45,264 --> 00:15:46,463
I failed it.

294
00:15:46,465 --> 00:15:48,232
And I wasn't
the only one.

295
00:15:48,234 --> 00:15:50,234
Mr. Queen.

296
00:15:50,236 --> 00:15:52,069
Mr. Queen!

297
00:15:53,137 --> 00:15:55,522
Did your father
survive that accident?

298
00:15:57,358 --> 00:16:01,812
I ask the questions.
You give me the answers.

299
00:16:12,674 --> 00:16:14,842
Did he make it
to the island?

300
00:16:14,844 --> 00:16:17,177
Did he tell you anything?

301
00:16:31,342 --> 00:16:33,677
Yes, he did.

302
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:36,980
What did he tell you,
Mr. Queen?

303
00:16:49,026 --> 00:16:51,562
He told me
I'm gonna kill you.

304
00:16:57,302 --> 00:16:58,886
You're delusional.

305
00:16:58,888 --> 00:17:01,588
You're zip-cuffed
to that chair.

306
00:17:03,641 --> 00:17:05,225
Not anymore.

307
00:18:01,265 --> 00:18:02,449
You killed that man.

308
00:18:02,451 --> 00:18:03,901
You don't have
to do this.

309
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:06,870
Yes, I do.

310
00:18:06,872 --> 00:18:08,538
Nobody can know my secret.

311
00:18:16,505 --> 00:18:17,856
So that's your story.
A guy in a green hood

312
00:18:17,858 --> 00:18:21,741
flew in and single-handedly
took out 3 armed kidnappers.

313
00:18:22,826 --> 00:18:24,893
I mean, who is he?

314
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,078
Why would he do that?

315
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,681
I don't know. Find
him and you can ask.

316
00:18:30,867 --> 00:18:34,486
Yeah. What about you?

317
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:35,930
You see the hood guy?

318
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:37,891
I saw...

319
00:18:37,893 --> 00:18:39,842
Just movement.

320
00:18:39,844 --> 00:18:43,079
Everything blurry.
I was kind of out of it.

321
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:44,414
Yeah.

322
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:47,050
It's funny, isn't it?
One day back,

323
00:18:47,052 --> 00:18:49,419
and already somebody's
gunning for you.

324
00:18:50,638 --> 00:18:52,171
Aren't you popular?

325
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:54,958
Were you able
to identify the men?

326
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,277
Scrubbed identities,
untraceable weapons.

327
00:18:57,279 --> 00:18:58,778
These were pros.

328
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,763
Yeah. Well, they
probably figured you'd

329
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:02,214
pay a king's ransom
to get your boy back

330
00:19:02,216 --> 00:19:03,666
or a Queen's ransom,

331
00:19:03,668 --> 00:19:05,568
as it were.

332
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:09,038
After all, a parent
would do anything

333
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,573
to keep
their child safe.

334
00:19:10,575 --> 00:19:14,244
I don't find your
tone appropriate, Detective.

335
00:19:14,246 --> 00:19:16,963
If Oliver can think
of anything else,

336
00:19:16,965 --> 00:19:18,331
he'll be in touch.

337
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,783
Thank you,
gentlemen,

338
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:22,001
for coming.

339
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,911
Your luck never seems
to run out, does it?

340
00:19:58,572 --> 00:19:59,906
You are different.

341
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:02,108
Not like you to read
a book.

342
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:06,612
I missed you, Raisa.

343
00:20:06,614 --> 00:20:08,681
No kitchen on
the island.

344
00:20:08,683 --> 00:20:11,267
No. No friends either.

345
00:20:12,553 --> 00:20:14,220
Hey.

346
00:20:15,789 --> 00:20:17,256
Thank you.

347
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,861
Do I really seem different?

348
00:20:21,863 --> 00:20:24,597
No. You're still
a good boy.

349
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:26,566
Oh, I think we both
know I wasn't.

350
00:20:26,568 --> 00:20:28,017
But a good heart.

351
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:29,402
I hope so.

352
00:20:29,404 --> 00:20:32,188
I want to be the person you
always told me I could be.

353
00:20:35,642 --> 00:20:40,113
Oliver, I want to
introduce you to someone...

354
00:20:40,115 --> 00:20:41,331
John Diggle.

355
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:43,266
He'll be accompanying
you from now on.

356
00:20:43,268 --> 00:20:44,500
I don't need a babysitter.

357
00:20:44,502 --> 00:20:46,753
Darling, Oliver's
a grown man.

358
00:20:46,755 --> 00:20:47,804
And if he
doesn't feel he needs

359
00:20:47,806 --> 00:20:48,988
armed protection...

360
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,656
Yeah, I understand,
but this is

361
00:20:50,658 --> 00:20:52,508
something I need.

362
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,348
So...

363
00:21:00,184 --> 00:21:01,851
What do I call you?

364
00:21:03,854 --> 00:21:06,139
Diggle's good.

365
00:21:06,141 --> 00:21:07,557
Dig if you want.

366
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:08,891
You're ex-military?

367
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:10,176
Yes, sir.
105th airborne

368
00:21:10,178 --> 00:21:12,111
of of Kandahar,
retired.

369
00:21:12,113 --> 00:21:13,229
Been in
the private sector

370
00:21:13,231 --> 00:21:15,732
a little more than
4 years now.

371
00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:17,700
I don't want there to be
any confusion, Mr. Queen.

372
00:21:17,702 --> 00:21:19,235
My ability to keep
you from harm

373
00:21:19,237 --> 00:21:20,870
will outweigh
your comfort.

374
00:21:22,539 --> 00:21:24,123
Do we have
an agreement?

375
00:21:26,543 --> 00:21:27,627
Sir?

376
00:21:30,248 --> 00:21:31,297
Sir!

377
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:13,206
The abduction was unexpected.

378
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:15,708
It forced me
to move up my plans,

379
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,794
but what I told
the police was true.

380
00:22:17,796 --> 00:22:21,180
The man in the green hood
was there in that warehouse,

381
00:22:21,182 --> 00:22:23,082
and he's just beginning.

382
00:23:52,155 --> 00:23:53,506
The suit alleges
that Hunt committed

383
00:23:53,508 --> 00:23:55,358
multiple acts of fraud
and theft

384
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,692
against the city's
underprivileged.

385
00:23:56,694 --> 00:23:58,945
Laurel Lance, an attorney
for the city necessary...

386
00:23:58,947 --> 00:24:00,446
Adam Hunt...

387
00:24:00,448 --> 00:24:02,732
his crimes go deeper
than fraud and theft,

388
00:24:02,734 --> 00:24:05,785
but he's been able to
bully, bribe, or kill anyone

389
00:24:05,787 --> 00:24:07,853
who's gotten into his way.

390
00:24:15,045 --> 00:24:17,129
He hasn't met me yet.

391
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,087
You remind Grell I put
him on the bench,

392
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:26,389
I can take him off.

393
00:24:26,391 --> 00:24:28,540
I will turn him into
a cautionary tale.

394
00:24:28,542 --> 00:24:29,642
Yes, Mr. Hunt.

395
00:24:29,644 --> 00:24:31,143
And this attorney
Laurel Lance...

396
00:24:31,145 --> 00:24:33,045
you said she wasn't gonna
be a problem anymore.

397
00:24:33,047 --> 00:24:37,049
I told you to fix
that situation.

398
00:24:37,051 --> 00:24:38,901
Why are you
still here?

399
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:45,557
Unh!

400
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:46,776
Get in the car!

401
00:24:50,964 --> 00:24:54,066
Hey. You missed.

402
00:24:54,068 --> 00:24:55,117
Unh!

403
00:24:58,506 --> 00:25:00,006
Aah!

404
00:25:03,243 --> 00:25:06,262
Unh! Aah!

405
00:25:06,264 --> 00:25:08,264
What? What?

406
00:25:08,266 --> 00:25:10,483
Just... just tell me
what you want.

407
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,770
You're gonna transfer
$40 million

408
00:25:14,772 --> 00:25:17,473
into Starling City
bank account 1141

409
00:25:17,475 --> 00:25:19,275
by 10 P.M. tomorrow night.
Or what?

410
00:25:19,277 --> 00:25:22,311
Or I'm gonna take it,
and you won't like how.

411
00:25:25,532 --> 00:25:28,117
If I see you again,
you're dead!

412
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:40,831
He was wearing a hood,

413
00:25:40,833 --> 00:25:43,033
a green hood,

414
00:25:43,035 --> 00:25:46,086
and he had
a bow and arrow.

415
00:25:46,088 --> 00:25:47,704
What, you don't
believe me?

416
00:25:47,706 --> 00:25:51,708
That maniac put two
of my men in the hospital.

417
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,043
Well, thanks
for your statement.

418
00:25:53,045 --> 00:25:57,764
We'll put out an APB
on... Robin Hood.

419
00:25:57,766 --> 00:25:59,749
Hey, pal.

420
00:25:59,751 --> 00:26:03,186
I'm not some grocer who got
taken for his register.

421
00:26:03,188 --> 00:26:05,555
I go to the front
of the line.

422
00:26:05,557 --> 00:26:07,641
Now he said he would be
back here by 10 P.M.

423
00:26:07,643 --> 00:26:09,559
Make sure
you're here first.

424
00:26:09,561 --> 00:26:13,096
You can coordinate with Mr. Drakon,
my new head of security.

425
00:26:19,603 --> 00:26:22,272
All right. Well, uh,
thanks for your time.

426
00:26:28,779 --> 00:26:30,831
It looks like Queen
was telling the truth.

427
00:26:30,833 --> 00:26:33,283
Yeah. Well, there's a first
time for everything.

428
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:39,122
This hooded guy comes looking
for trouble, he'll find it.

429
00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:52,536
Put on your
seat belt, sir.

430
00:26:52,538 --> 00:26:54,371
Wouldn't want you
to miss your party.

Ollie, Ollie,
Ollie, Ollie.

447
00:27:52,363 --> 00:27:54,547
I missed Tequila!

448
00:28:03,975 --> 00:28:05,675
What the hell's
going on out there?

449
00:28:05,677 --> 00:28:07,543
It's across
the street.

450
00:28:07,545 --> 00:28:09,729
Party for the guy that got
rescued off that island...

451
00:28:09,731 --> 00:28:11,398
Oliver Queen.

452
00:28:18,356 --> 00:28:21,057
Hey. Does he wipe
for you, too?

453
00:28:21,059 --> 00:28:26,396
Now by my rough estimate, you
have not had sex in 1,839 days.

454
00:28:26,398 --> 00:28:28,198
As your wingman,
I highly recommend

455
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,732
Carmen Golden.

456
00:28:29,734 --> 00:28:30,951
Which one is she?

457
00:28:30,953 --> 00:28:32,786
The one who looks like the
chick from "Twilight."

458
00:28:32,788 --> 00:28:34,287
What's "Twilight"?

459
00:28:34,289 --> 00:28:36,122
You're so better off
not knowing.

460
00:28:45,633 --> 00:28:47,350
Back in a minute.

461
00:28:50,438 --> 00:28:53,106
Ollie, hey!
This party is sick.

462
00:28:53,108 --> 00:28:54,357
Who let you
in here?

463
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:55,725
I believe it was
somebody who said,

464
00:28:55,727 --> 00:28:57,560
"Right this way,
Miss Queen."

465
00:28:57,562 --> 00:28:59,779
Well, you shouldn't
be here.

466
00:28:59,781 --> 00:29:00,814
I'm not 12 anymore.

467
00:29:00,816 --> 00:29:02,765
No. You're 17.

468
00:29:02,767 --> 00:29:04,701
Ollie, I love you,

469
00:29:04,703 --> 00:29:07,037
but you can't come back
here and judge me,

470
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,571
especially for being
just like you.

471
00:29:08,573 --> 00:29:11,291
I know that it couldn't have been
easy for you when I was away...

472
00:29:11,293 --> 00:29:15,278
Away? No. You died.

473
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,998
My brother
and my father died.

474
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,749
I went
to your funerals.

475
00:29:19,751 --> 00:29:21,051
I know.
No, you don't.

476
00:29:21,053 --> 00:29:24,804
Mom had Walter,
and I had no one.

477
00:29:24,806 --> 00:29:26,673
You guys all act
like it's cool,

478
00:29:26,675 --> 00:29:29,092
let's forget about
the last 5 years.

479
00:29:29,094 --> 00:29:30,894
Well, I can't.

480
00:29:30,896 --> 00:29:32,595
For me, it's kind of
permanently in there,

481
00:29:32,597 --> 00:29:34,064
so I'm sorry
if I turned out

482
00:29:34,066 --> 00:29:35,965
some major
disappointment,

483
00:29:35,967 --> 00:29:38,801
but this me is
the best I could do

484
00:29:38,803 --> 00:29:42,822
with what I had
to work with.

485
00:29:42,824 --> 00:29:44,691
Let's bounce.

486
00:29:46,444 --> 00:29:47,643
You have
the fun dip?

487
00:29:47,645 --> 00:29:49,829
Yeah. It's right...

488
00:29:49,831 --> 00:29:52,499
No. I... I must have
dropped it.

489
00:30:00,674 --> 00:30:03,159
Oh! Oh.

490
00:30:03,161 --> 00:30:04,711
You're here.

491
00:30:04,713 --> 00:30:07,547
Tommy. He made the
point that we have

492
00:30:07,549 --> 00:30:08,965
too many years
between us

493
00:30:08,967 --> 00:30:12,435
to leave things the
way we left them.

494
00:30:12,437 --> 00:30:15,472
Is there someplace quieter
that we could go?

495
00:30:15,474 --> 00:30:16,723
Yeah.

496
00:30:19,727 --> 00:30:23,196
I'm sorry about saying that you
should have been the one who died.

497
00:30:24,681 --> 00:30:27,367
That was wrong.

498
00:30:27,369 --> 00:30:29,486
If I could trade places
with her, I would.

499
00:30:33,074 --> 00:30:34,657
About Sarah.

500
00:30:37,144 --> 00:30:39,095
There's something that
I've been afraid to ask,

501
00:30:39,097 --> 00:30:41,664
but I need to know.

502
00:30:41,666 --> 00:30:43,032
Ok.

503
00:30:46,087 --> 00:30:47,637
When she died...

504
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,758
Did she suffer?

505
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,426
Sarah!
Aah!

506
00:30:53,428 --> 00:30:56,396
No.

507
00:30:56,398 --> 00:30:58,881
I think about her
every day.

508
00:30:58,883 --> 00:31:02,102
Me, too.

509
00:31:02,104 --> 00:31:04,571
I guess we still have
one thing in common then.

510
00:31:07,558 --> 00:31:11,945
I can't believe
I'm gonna say this, but...

511
00:31:11,947 --> 00:31:14,013
If you need someone
to talk to

512
00:31:14,015 --> 00:31:16,566
about what happened
to you, I'm here.

513
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:27,177
Something wrong?

514
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:30,296
I asked somebody
to do something.

515
00:31:30,298 --> 00:31:31,781
They didn't do it.

516
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:37,103
Laurel...

517
00:31:44,061 --> 00:31:46,779
You always saw
the best in me.

518
00:31:46,781 --> 00:31:49,315
Right now, that's
what you're doing,

519
00:31:49,317 --> 00:31:51,734
looking at me,
and you're wondering

520
00:31:51,736 --> 00:31:53,536
if that island
changed me somehow,

521
00:31:53,538 --> 00:31:55,771
if it made me
a better person.

522
00:31:55,773 --> 00:31:58,057
It didn't.

523
00:31:58,059 --> 00:31:59,709
Stay away from me.

524
00:31:59,711 --> 00:32:01,944
Otherwise...

525
00:32:01,946 --> 00:32:06,115
I'm just gonna
hurt you again,

526
00:32:06,117 --> 00:32:09,836
but this time,
it will be worse.

527
00:32:09,838 --> 00:32:11,838
Got to roll.

528
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:16,676
I got 5 years of
debauchery to catch up on

529
00:32:16,678 --> 00:32:18,127
You know what, Oliver?

530
00:32:20,264 --> 00:32:23,983
You're wrong. That
island did change you.

531
00:32:23,985 --> 00:32:26,102
At least now
you're honest.

532
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:41,284
Something I can
help you with, sir?

533
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:46,673
I just wanted a second
to myself.

534
00:32:46,675 --> 00:32:47,957
I would believe you,
Mr. Queen,

535
00:32:47,959 --> 00:32:51,261
if you weren't
so full of crap.

536
00:32:51,263 --> 00:32:52,929
Party's this way.

537
00:32:57,834 --> 00:32:59,352
It's locked.

538
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:06,226
You two cover
the elevator.

539
00:33:06,228 --> 00:33:07,527
Hang back and be ready.

540
00:33:07,529 --> 00:33:09,845
Stay in the corners
and stay alert.

541
00:33:17,789 --> 00:33:19,188
It's past 10:00.

542
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:20,856
He's never getting
in here.

543
00:33:32,035 --> 00:33:34,087
All's clear.

544
00:33:34,089 --> 00:33:35,255
Yeah.

545
00:34:11,625 --> 00:34:13,042
Unh!

546
00:34:17,214 --> 00:34:18,348
You missed.

547
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:19,632
Really?

548
00:34:19,634 --> 00:34:20,883
Hunh!

549
00:34:26,857 --> 00:34:27,974
He's here!

550
00:34:27,976 --> 00:34:31,394
All units, converge!
All units, converge!

551
00:34:59,056 --> 00:35:00,289
Aigh!

552
00:35:18,806 --> 00:35:20,674
Go right, go right.

553
00:35:20,676 --> 00:35:21,808
On me.

554
00:35:31,652 --> 00:35:34,271
Lay down your weapons,
or we will open fire!

555
00:35:34,273 --> 00:35:36,723
I repeat, lay down
your weapons.

556
00:35:49,203 --> 00:35:52,038
Tell me
you saw that.

557
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,957
Ok. Let's go. Move.

558
00:35:53,959 --> 00:35:57,210
♪ Girls, girls, girls ♪

559
00:35:57,212 --> 00:35:58,512
♪ Hot babes ♪

560
00:35:58,514 --> 00:35:59,462
Cut it.

561
00:35:59,464 --> 00:36:01,047
Search the building
roof to basement.

562
00:36:01,049 --> 00:36:02,465
Find him!

563
00:36:02,467 --> 00:36:03,517
Starling City police!

564
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:04,768
The party's over, kids.

565
00:36:06,438 --> 00:36:09,940
Oh, Mr. Merlyn. Imagine my
shock at finding you here.

566
00:36:09,942 --> 00:36:12,359
Did you roofie anyone
special tonight, huh?

567
00:36:12,361 --> 00:36:15,729
Detective!
It's a private party.

568
00:36:15,731 --> 00:36:17,430
Yeah? Well, there was an incident
at Adam Hunt's building tonight.

569
00:36:17,432 --> 00:36:18,949
You know anything
about that?

570
00:36:18,951 --> 00:36:20,567
Who's Adam Hunt?

571
00:36:20,569 --> 00:36:23,102
He's a millionaire bottom feeder, and I'm
kind of surprised you aren't friends.

572
00:36:23,104 --> 00:36:25,872
I've been out of town
for... a while.

573
00:36:25,874 --> 00:36:29,159
Yeah. Well, he just got attacked
by the guy with the hood,

574
00:36:29,161 --> 00:36:31,244
the guy that saved
your ass the other day.

575
00:36:31,246 --> 00:36:32,495
The hood guy.

576
00:36:32,497 --> 00:36:33,613
You didn't find him?

577
00:36:33,615 --> 00:36:34,831
I'm gonna offer
a reward.

578
00:36:34,833 --> 00:36:37,467
Hey, everybody.
$2 million to anybody

579
00:36:37,469 --> 00:36:39,786
that can find a nut bar
in a green hood.

580
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:48,311
Did you even try
to save her?

581
00:36:48,313 --> 00:36:49,729
Ok. Let's go, partner.

582
00:36:49,731 --> 00:36:51,464
Did you even try
to save my daughter?

583
00:36:51,466 --> 00:36:52,766
Sarah wouldn't want this.

584
00:36:52,768 --> 00:36:55,969
It's not.
Partner, let's go.

585
00:36:55,971 --> 00:36:57,520
It's all right.
Let's go.

586
00:37:04,812 --> 00:37:06,145
It's way too quiet
in here!

587
00:37:06,147 --> 00:37:07,864
This is a party!

588
00:37:13,704 --> 00:37:16,539
Some coincidence, I mean, you
asking to have your party here,

589
00:37:16,541 --> 00:37:18,291
and Hunt getting robbed
right next door

590
00:37:18,293 --> 00:37:21,928
and by the same guy who
rescued us at the warehouse.

591
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:23,597
If I were you,
Tommy,

592
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:26,016
I'd just be glad
you're alive.

593
00:37:26,018 --> 00:37:29,135
What happened to you
on that island?

594
00:37:29,137 --> 00:37:30,553
A lot.

595
00:37:37,395 --> 00:37:39,062
What the hell
are you talking about?

596
00:37:39,064 --> 00:37:43,783
$40 million doesn't
just up and vanish!

597
00:37:43,785 --> 00:37:45,068
Untraceable?!

598
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:48,855
It is $40 million!
Find it!

599
00:37:51,409 --> 00:37:52,792
How did he do it?

600
00:38:29,664 --> 00:38:32,532
There's not enough
for all of us.

601
00:38:32,534 --> 00:38:34,034
Save your strength.

602
00:38:34,036 --> 00:38:37,954
You can survive
this, make it home,

603
00:38:37,956 --> 00:38:41,908
make it better,
right my wrongs,

604
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:43,793
but you got to live
through this first.

605
00:38:45,546 --> 00:38:47,630
You hear me, Ollie?
You hear me, son?

606
00:38:51,385 --> 00:38:53,269
Just rest, dad.

607
00:39:02,596 --> 00:39:03,947
No.

608
00:39:17,545 --> 00:39:19,079
Dad?!

609
00:39:19,081 --> 00:39:20,880
Survive.

610
00:39:20,882 --> 00:39:21,881
No!

611
00:39:31,225 --> 00:39:35,011
If hypothetically
$50,000 magically appeared

612
00:39:35,013 --> 00:39:37,564
in your bank account,
it might be best

613
00:39:37,566 --> 00:39:39,733
for you not to
speak about it...

614
00:39:39,735 --> 00:39:44,404
To anyone... Ever.

615
00:39:44,406 --> 00:39:47,240
God bless you, too.

616
00:39:47,242 --> 00:39:48,875
I just got a very
grateful phone call

617
00:39:48,877 --> 00:39:51,444
from one of our clients
against Adam Hunt.

618
00:39:51,446 --> 00:39:52,946
Me, too. Heh.

619
00:39:57,002 --> 00:40:02,622
It looks like Starling
City has a guardian angel.

620
00:40:02,624 --> 00:40:05,041
By the way, your
cute friend's here.

621
00:40:10,714 --> 00:40:12,465
You left the party
pretty quick last night,

622
00:40:12,467 --> 00:40:15,468
even after I made sure the bar
was stocked with Pinot Noir.

623
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:17,353
It wasn't really
my scene.

624
00:40:17,355 --> 00:40:20,774
I thought maybe you and Oliver
went mano-a-mano again.

625
00:40:20,776 --> 00:40:22,275
I saw you two
head out.

626
00:40:22,277 --> 00:40:25,728
There's nothing between
Oliver and I, not anymore.

627
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:29,182
Here I thought the only thing
between you and Oliver was us.

628
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:33,369
I wouldn't exactly characterize
us as an "us," Tommy.

629
00:40:33,371 --> 00:40:34,687
Then what would
you call it?

630
00:40:34,689 --> 00:40:35,822
A lapse.

631
00:40:35,824 --> 00:40:36,990
That's quite
a few lapses...

632
00:40:36,992 --> 00:40:38,675
your place,
my place,

633
00:40:38,677 --> 00:40:42,078
my place again.

634
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,363
Oh, come on, Merlyn. We
both know that you're not

635
00:40:44,365 --> 00:40:46,466
a one-girl type of guy.

636
00:40:46,468 --> 00:40:49,385
Depends on the girl.

637
00:40:49,387 --> 00:40:51,254
I have to go
back to work.

638
00:40:52,673 --> 00:40:58,044
Dinah Laurel Lance always
trying to save the world.

639
00:40:58,046 --> 00:41:02,482
Hey. If I don't try
and save it, who will?

640
00:41:02,484 --> 00:41:07,437
♪ Let's get out of here ♪

641
00:41:07,439 --> 00:41:11,074
♪ won't you come along? ♪

642
00:41:15,996 --> 00:41:18,397
She says the island changed me.

643
00:41:20,567 --> 00:41:24,838
She has no idea how much.

644
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:27,507
There are many more names
on the list,

645
00:41:27,509 --> 00:41:33,096
those who rule my city
through intimidation and fear.

646
00:41:33,098 --> 00:41:37,133
Every last one of them will
wish I had died on that island.

647
00:41:46,777 --> 00:41:50,480
The police failed to identify the
men I hired to kidnap Oliver,

648
00:41:50,482 --> 00:41:52,532
and they never will.

649
00:41:52,534 --> 00:41:54,951
Should we arrange
another abduction?

650
00:41:54,953 --> 00:41:56,953
No.

651
00:41:56,955 --> 00:42:02,208
