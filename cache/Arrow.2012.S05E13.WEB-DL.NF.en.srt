CONCEALED HIS IDENTITY

HIMSELF KILLED. AND...

296
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:02,889
I'M TOUGHER THAN I LOOK,

AND I NEED TO BE
IN THE OFFICE.

298

00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:21,241
WHAT DO WE KNOW?

304
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,368
WE DON'T KNOW MUCH.

305

IT WAS A SINGLE SHOOTER,

AND IT...
IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT I

307
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:31,000
WAS HIS PRIMARY TARGET
BECAUSE HE JUST...

308
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:33,211
BLASTED HIS WAY
THROUGH CITY HALL.

309
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:34,504
IF HE WASN'T
GOING AFTER YOU,

310
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:36,256
THEN THERE'S
A LARGER AGENDA HERE.

311

FAMILY'S WEAPON OF CHOICE.

312
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:41,511
OVER 90% OF THE HITS THEY
WERE INVOLVED IN LAST YEAR

313
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:42,929
USED THEM.

314
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,805
WHY WOULD THE BERTINELLIS
TARGET CITY HALL?

00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:50,263
AND HARD CHOICES REQUIRE
BRAVERY.

943
00:39:50,305 --> 00:39:55,185
FORTUNATELY, WE LIVE IN
THE HOME OF THE BRAVE.

944
00:39:55,227 --> 00:39:57,645
AND WE DON'T RUN FROM
HARD CHOICES.

945
00:39:57,687 --> 00:40:01,482
WE RISE UP, AND WE FACE
TOMORROW TOGETHER.

946
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:08,656
UH, THIS AFTERNOON,
COUNCILWOMAN POLLARD AND I MET

947
00:40:08,698 --> 00:40:10,783
WITH THE CITY COUNCIL TO PASS

948
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:13,703
THE STAR CITY FIREARMS
FREEDOM ACT,

949
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:16,706
A POLICY THAT RESPECTS OUR
FREEDOM...

950
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:20,085
AND OUR LIVES.

951
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:25,090
IT SHOWS THAT WE CAN DO BOTH.

952
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:32,680
AND NOW WE JUST HAVE TO BE
BRAVE ENOUGH TO DO IT.

953
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:06,839
MAN: GREG, MOVE YOUR HEAD.
