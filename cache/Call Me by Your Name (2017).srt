1
00:02:50,797 --> 00:02:52,173
The usurper.

8
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,334
He seems very confident.

13
00:03:35,466 --> 00:03:36,634
I'll go down.

17
00:03:54,027 --> 00:03:56,487
Darling, come help Oliver
take his things up to his room.

18
00:03:56,571 --> 00:03:57,989
- He's already here?
- Yes!

29
00:04:27,602 --> 00:04:28,937
You're leaving?

46
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:05,444
I'll take care of the tart.

64
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,442
Let me do it.

73
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:03,419
Thank you.

76
00:09:07,465 --> 00:09:10,551
Peaches, cherries, apricots...

118
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,337
Help yourself, darling.

119
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,713
Thanks.

147
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,242
- Ciao, Romano.
- Ciao, Oliver.

148
00:13:45,326 --> 00:13:47,912
- How are you?
- All good.

149
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:54,710
Ciao, boys!

150
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:56,629
All good?

151
00:13:56,712 --> 00:13:58,380
All good!

152
00:13:58,464 --> 00:13:59,965
Let's see. What have we got?

153
00:14:00,049 --> 00:14:02,885
- Can you start please?
- Of course!

154
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:24,823
Good morning, gentlemen.

157
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:36,877
Go, Chiara!

158
00:14:43,676 --> 00:14:45,678
No, no, no, no, no!

159
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:48,222
He's better than the guy
who came last year.

160
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:49,682
Remember?

161
00:14:50,182 --> 00:14:51,600
Get in there!

162
00:14:51,684 --> 00:14:54,562
Much better!
See how cute he is.

163
00:15:06,282 --> 00:15:07,783
Elio, water!

184
00:16:00,753 --> 00:16:04,381
Sweetheart, Auntie Marcella and
the others are coming over for dinner.

185
00:16:05,174 --> 00:16:07,885
Is Oliver staying with us or going out?

186
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:09,303
Don't know.

187
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,680
What a movie star!

188
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,475
Yes, those Americans...

189
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,708
Sparkling wine!

190
00:16:40,668 --> 00:16:42,044
He's late.

191
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,713
Don't you think...

192
00:16:45,673 --> 00:16:48,717
Don't you think he's impolite
when he says, "Later"?

193
00:16:49,885 --> 00:16:51,512
Arrogant.

203
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:12,658
Oh, no, sweetheart.

204
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:17,454
- Take his plates away.
- Very well, madam.

205
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:22,626
Darling?

207
00:17:44,732 --> 00:17:46,442
I don't want to.

208
00:17:47,276 --> 00:17:48,485
Why not?

209
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:50,028
Because I don't want to.

210
00:17:50,112 --> 00:17:52,448
Why don't you go
to Moscazzano with others?

211
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:54,241
Because I don't want to.

213
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,587
Play well, darling.

240
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:39,257
Thank God you're helping me.

270
00:25:20,812 --> 00:25:22,772
Have you been to the river?

271
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,455
Mafalda!

272
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,373
Isn't she beautiful?

295
00:27:35,363 --> 00:27:36,531
Come here.

296
00:27:38,867 --> 00:27:40,285
What's going on?

297
00:27:40,368 --> 00:27:42,162
Is he trying to get it on with her?

298
00:27:42,287 --> 00:27:44,414
Elio, he already succeeded?

299
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:47,751
What do I know?

300
00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:49,502
I'd love to be in his shoes.

301
00:27:49,586 --> 00:27:51,504
Who wouldn't love to be in her shoes?

302
00:27:53,965 --> 00:27:56,217
She wants him, no matter what!

303
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:41,638
Coming?

304
00:28:43,973 --> 00:28:45,308
I'll come later.

305
00:30:00,717 --> 00:30:03,595
Are you with me because
you're mad at Chiara?

306
00:30:03,678 --> 00:30:05,346
Why would I be mad at Chiara?

307
00:30:06,556 --> 00:30:08,057
Because of him.

308
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:09,601
Because of who?

309
00:30:10,768 --> 00:30:12,020
Of Oliver.

310
00:30:23,531 --> 00:30:24,908
Turn around.

311
00:30:39,547 --> 00:30:41,382
Meet me here tomorrow night?

312
00:30:48,264 --> 00:30:50,558
Wait for me!

313
00:30:50,642 --> 00:30:52,185
Come on.

335
00:32:03,715 --> 00:32:05,174
What are you doing?

336
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,218
Going to Lake Garda with my dad.

337
00:32:07,302 --> 00:32:09,304
He wants to show Oliver
where he's dredging.

338
00:32:10,263 --> 00:32:11,639
Can you tell him I came by?

339
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:14,475
He's inside with my dad, helping him.

340
00:32:16,311 --> 00:32:19,731
You were amazing last night,
on the dance floor.

341
00:32:19,814 --> 00:32:21,691
- He's a good dancer.
- A good dancer.

342
00:32:24,068 --> 00:32:25,737
He's good-looking too.

343
00:32:27,196 --> 00:32:28,990
- Want to get us together?
- No.

344
00:32:30,742 --> 00:32:32,410
Come in.

354
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:44,941
I'll drive today!

356
00:33:53,199 --> 00:33:56,619
Anchise, take the afternoon off.

363
00:35:01,768 --> 00:35:03,519
Sammy! Come on!

364
00:35:16,574 --> 00:35:18,034
Truce?

390
00:39:28,284 --> 00:39:31,037
Sorry, Elio.
I brought some clean clothes.

391
00:39:36,125 --> 00:39:37,585
Leave the door open.

392
00:39:38,711 --> 00:39:40,379
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

436
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:08,142
I straightened the wheels
and inflated the tires.

437
00:46:08,225 --> 00:46:09,643
Perfect. Thanks.

481
00:51:03,478 --> 00:51:05,355
Let's go, American!

486
00:52:19,095 --> 00:52:20,680
Good morning, ma'am.

487
00:52:22,265 --> 00:52:23,558
Excuse me.

488
00:52:24,476 --> 00:52:27,187
Could I ask for a glass of water?

489
00:52:37,906 --> 00:52:39,199
The Duke.

490
00:52:39,282 --> 00:52:41,076
"People of Italy!"

492
00:52:47,541 --> 00:52:49,084
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

525
00:57:42,877 --> 00:57:46,381
So we got the government
of Bettino Craxi...

526
00:57:46,506 --> 00:57:49,008
Because we don't do anything
but talk, talk, talk.

527
00:57:49,134 --> 00:57:51,010
Let me speak.

528
00:57:51,136 --> 00:57:54,639
We have five parties
that do nothing but fight.

529
00:57:54,722 --> 00:57:57,475
Smoke and shut up!
Let them speak, him, her.

530
00:57:57,684 --> 00:58:00,478
I'd like to know what they think too.

531
00:58:00,603 --> 00:58:03,398
Annella, what do you think?
A five party government!

532
00:58:03,523 --> 00:58:06,693
Darling, I think
it's the historic compromise...

533
00:58:06,776 --> 00:58:10,864
Don't say that. Compromises are tragic.

534
00:58:10,947 --> 00:58:13,741
You've changed
since you inherited this place.

535
00:58:13,867 --> 00:58:15,535
What's that got to do with it?

536
00:58:15,618 --> 00:58:17,412
What are you saying?

537
00:58:18,121 --> 00:58:19,789
You're mad, darling.

538
00:58:20,623 --> 00:58:21,833
You asshole!

539
00:58:21,916 --> 00:58:25,795
- She's right.
- And you don't say anything to her.

540
00:58:26,421 --> 00:58:28,548
Say something.

541
00:58:28,715 --> 00:58:30,341
You're resigned.

542
00:58:30,425 --> 00:58:33,011
Why don't we talk
about the death of Buñuel?

543
00:58:33,094 --> 00:58:36,139
Buñuel was a genius.

544
00:58:36,222 --> 00:58:37,849
- Know him?
- Cinema isn't the answer.

545
00:58:37,932 --> 00:58:41,227
Cinema is a mirror of reality
and it's a filter.

546
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:45,023
They broadcast <i>The Phantom of Liberty</i>
with constant interr...

547
00:58:45,148 --> 00:58:47,609
Everyone loves Buñuel!

548
00:58:47,775 --> 00:58:49,277
Let's hear his opinion.

549
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:51,821
He doesn't know anything about Italy!

550
00:58:51,946 --> 00:58:53,865
Say something. Give us your impression.

551
00:58:54,032 --> 00:58:55,533
Do you have an impression?

552
00:58:55,658 --> 00:58:57,702
Darling, he's American.

553
00:58:57,827 --> 00:58:59,162
That doesn't mean stupid!

554
00:59:05,168 --> 00:59:07,212
Just stop.

555
00:59:07,337 --> 00:59:11,216
I don't give an easy ride
to some politicians.

556
00:59:11,341 --> 00:59:14,177
She didn't say that.

557
00:59:14,344 --> 00:59:16,179
I'm going to go mad.

558
00:59:16,304 --> 00:59:18,139
What's the matter?

559
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:21,142
What's wrong?

560
00:59:21,267 --> 00:59:23,269
It's nothing. It happens all the time.

561
00:59:23,436 --> 00:59:26,564
- Mafalda, ice?
- It's in the fridge.

562
00:59:26,773 --> 00:59:29,317
You get used to absolutely everything.

563
01:00:05,812 --> 01:00:08,856
Don't you realize
you're mixing everything up?

564
01:00:08,982 --> 01:00:10,608
What are you talking about?

565
01:00:10,733 --> 01:00:13,486
There's no more politics, nothing.
He's left too.

592
01:02:02,845 --> 01:02:03,846
You okay?

593
01:02:11,646 --> 01:02:12,980
Are we going out?

594
01:02:14,732 --> 01:02:18,277
I don't know if I can go out.
If my mom sees, she'll worry.

595
01:02:18,403 --> 01:02:20,488
- She will?
- Yeah, she's a pain.

596
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:27,370
Where's Oliver?

597
01:02:27,495 --> 01:02:29,038
Don't ask me.

598
01:02:46,556 --> 01:02:47,974
Where's Oliver?

599
01:02:48,975 --> 01:02:51,686
- Didn't he go out?
- Would you like a smoothie?

600
01:02:51,853 --> 01:02:54,397
No, thank you. We're having dinner soon.

601
01:02:54,522 --> 01:02:55,815
All right.

602
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:57,191
I'm going out tonight.

603
01:02:57,316 --> 01:03:00,611
- Don't make me worry.
- What are you talking about?

604
01:03:00,736 --> 01:03:02,405
This is no good, madam.

605
01:03:02,530 --> 01:03:04,615
- Let him do his own thing.
- Fine.

606
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:06,742
Why's she hassling me? I'm 17.

607
01:03:06,909 --> 01:03:08,453
She's worried about you.

608
01:03:13,249 --> 01:03:15,751
You like him, don't you? Oliver?

609
01:03:16,752 --> 01:03:18,588
Everyone likes Oliver.

610
01:03:19,172 --> 01:03:21,090
I think he likes you too.

611
01:03:21,215 --> 01:03:22,467
More than you do.

612
01:03:25,011 --> 01:03:26,971
Is that your impression?

613
01:03:27,096 --> 01:03:29,932
- No, he told me.
- When did he say that?

614
01:03:30,933 --> 01:03:32,310
A while ago.

615
01:03:56,834 --> 01:03:59,086
Mafalda, do you know where Oliver is?

616
01:03:59,212 --> 01:04:00,671
I have no idea.

619
01:06:34,408 --> 01:06:37,370
(REporter on TV Speaking Italian)
This is Craxi.I draw the center of Craxi...

620
01:06:53,511 --> 01:06:54,887
- Hey.
<i>- Hi!</i>

621
01:06:56,013 --> 01:06:58,683
It's me. Is that Marzia?

622
01:06:58,808 --> 01:07:00,601
<i>Sure it is! Can't you tell?</i>

623
01:07:00,726 --> 01:07:01,727
Sorry.

624
01:07:21,872 --> 01:07:23,082
Is that for me?

625
01:07:24,583 --> 01:07:25,751
Thanks.

626
01:07:42,435 --> 01:07:44,645
Do you really read a lot?

627
01:07:44,812 --> 01:07:47,481
I love reading too,
but I don't tell anyone.

628
01:07:48,149 --> 01:07:49,734
Why not?

629
01:07:49,859 --> 01:07:51,152
I don't know.

630
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:54,572
I think...

631
01:07:55,114 --> 01:07:57,616
people who read are...

632
01:07:58,242 --> 01:07:59,368
kind of secretive.

633
01:08:00,870 --> 01:08:03,205
They hide who they really are.

634
01:08:04,582 --> 01:08:06,417
Do you hide who you really are?

635
01:08:07,209 --> 01:08:08,753
No, not with you.

636
01:08:08,919 --> 01:08:10,004
Not with me?

637
01:08:14,216 --> 01:08:16,260
Well, maybe a bit.

638
01:08:16,385 --> 01:08:17,803
What do you mean?

639
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:21,474
You know exactly what I mean.

640
01:08:21,599 --> 01:08:23,267
Why do you say that?

641
01:08:23,934 --> 01:08:25,019
Why?

642
01:08:27,313 --> 01:08:28,522
Because...

643
01:08:29,231 --> 01:08:30,816
I think...

644
01:08:30,941 --> 01:08:32,902
you're going to hurt me,

645
01:08:33,068 --> 01:08:34,779
and I don't want to be hurt.

646
01:08:51,712 --> 01:08:53,547
You're so hard.

647
01:08:59,887 --> 01:09:01,305
Wait.

648
01:09:01,430 --> 01:09:02,807
Kiss me.

649
01:09:10,439 --> 01:09:11,899
- Is that good?
- Yes.

650
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:14,401
Are you lying?

651
01:09:25,746 --> 01:09:28,582
- Oh, fuck, I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

652
01:09:28,749 --> 01:09:30,876
Are you mad at me? Are you angry?

653
01:09:41,428 --> 01:09:44,098
What's so funny? Why are you laughing?

654
01:09:44,932 --> 01:09:46,433
Leave me alone.

655
01:09:47,643 --> 01:09:49,270
Fuck, that felt good.

700
01:13:44,630 --> 01:13:46,340
I won't be here for dinner.

701
01:13:46,423 --> 01:13:48,175
Okay, Mr. Oliver.

702
01:14:20,082 --> 01:14:21,792
Hello, Mafalda.

703
01:14:21,917 --> 01:14:22,918
Marzia.

704
01:14:26,004 --> 01:14:27,339
Where are we going?

705
01:14:27,422 --> 01:14:28,674
You'll see.

706
01:14:43,897 --> 01:14:44,898
Stop it!

707
01:17:21,013 --> 01:17:22,973
- How are you, buddy?
- Hey!

708
01:17:23,098 --> 01:17:25,058
- It's been ages.
- It has, yes.

709
01:17:25,809 --> 01:17:27,602
- How are you?
- You've grown.

712
01:17:30,522 --> 01:17:32,524
Remember Marzia from last year.

713
01:17:32,649 --> 01:17:33,692
Hello.

714
01:17:33,775 --> 01:17:36,111
- Marzia, remember Isaac?
- The girl from Paris?

715
01:17:36,236 --> 01:17:37,571
Good to meet you.

716
01:17:37,696 --> 01:17:39,156
Want to eat with us tonight?

718
01:17:40,615 --> 01:17:42,326
- You're sure?
- Yes.

720
01:17:44,494 --> 01:17:45,620
Goodbye.

739
01:18:48,975 --> 01:18:52,646
These are unbelievable. I just...

740
01:18:55,273 --> 01:18:56,942
Hey, look who's here.

807
01:33:51,252 --> 01:33:52,920
Times change.

808
01:33:53,087 --> 01:33:54,797
Thank God we had the partisans.

809
01:33:54,964 --> 01:33:59,051
I know, but times have changed.
It's different.

810
01:33:59,176 --> 01:34:01,220
What do you think of Bettino?

811
01:34:01,345 --> 01:34:04,223
- I don't like him.
- I like him.

812
01:34:04,473 --> 01:34:06,767
I'm happy, actually.

813
01:34:09,770 --> 01:34:11,814
I don't know. We'll see.

814
01:34:14,275 --> 01:34:16,819
Anyway, they make the rules.

815
01:34:20,531 --> 01:34:22,033
Pasquina!

816
01:34:22,116 --> 01:34:23,367
Hello.

817
01:34:23,492 --> 01:34:24,827
Hello, ma'am.

818
01:34:25,786 --> 01:34:27,872
- Tortelli cremaschi.
- Yes.

819
01:35:51,455 --> 01:35:52,790
Oh, fuck.

864
01:42:18,091 --> 01:42:20,010
You disappeared for three days.

866
01:42:27,476 --> 01:42:29,770
You completely disappeared.

868
01:42:36,026 --> 01:42:37,569
I had a lot to do.


895
01:44:49,826 --> 01:44:51,954
Come for dinner tonight.

896
01:44:52,037 --> 01:44:53,288
Bring Marzia.

897
01:44:54,873 --> 01:44:56,124
Bye, darling.


940
01:48:46,271 --> 01:48:47,772
If you'll excuse me...

941
01:48:47,898 --> 01:48:49,900
Just one second.

942
01:48:50,817 --> 01:48:52,235
One second!



948
01:49:11,838 --> 01:49:13,840
I saw them last year.

949
01:49:14,674 --> 01:49:17,177
Richard Butler... fantastic!

950
01:49:17,344 --> 01:49:21,014
Really? We saw them in concert too.

951
01:49:21,097 --> 01:49:23,934
We hitchhiked to London.


956
01:49:38,156 --> 01:49:39,991
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.

961
01:53:53,786 --> 01:53:55,205
Yeah, it's me.

962
01:53:56,539 --> 01:53:58,917
Yeah, everything is fine.
I'm at the station...

963
01:53:59,626 --> 01:54:00,960
in Clusone.

964
01:54:02,837 --> 01:54:04,547
Listen, Mom, can you...

965
01:54:06,174 --> 01:54:08,134
Can you come get me, Mom?

968
01:55:06,859 --> 01:55:09,112
I read the book you bought me.

969
01:55:09,821 --> 01:55:11,531
The poems...

970
01:55:11,656 --> 01:55:13,157
They're really beautiful.

971
01:55:13,283 --> 01:55:16,327
I love that... Antonia Pozzi.

972
01:55:19,497 --> 01:55:21,499
I'm sorry, excuse me...

973
01:55:21,624 --> 01:55:23,334
that you're sad.

974
01:55:24,627 --> 01:55:27,547
I'm saying that because
I wanted to tell you

975
01:55:27,672 --> 01:55:29,340
I'm not mad at you.

976
01:55:30,925 --> 01:55:32,260
Not at all.

977
01:55:39,892 --> 01:55:41,185
I love you, Elio.

978
01:55:46,608 --> 01:55:47,942
Stay friends?

979
01:55:49,986 --> 01:55:51,321
For life?

980
01:55:52,113 --> 01:55:53,406
For life?

992
01:58:06,372 --> 01:58:08,291
Because it was him.

993
01:58:09,459 --> 01:58:11,294
Because it was me.

1044
02:03:19,310 --> 02:03:21,896
- Have you been to the Gaverine?
- Yes.

1046
02:03:31,822 --> 02:03:33,491
- May I?

1047
02:03:33,616 --> 02:03:34,700
To you too.

1048
02:03:55,387 --> 02:03:56,847
She looks a bit weak.

1052
02:04:20,663 --> 02:04:21,664
Hello?
