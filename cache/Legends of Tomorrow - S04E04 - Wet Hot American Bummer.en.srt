Ugh. [SPITS] You call that soup?

971
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:20,340
[COUGHS]

972
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:23,010
Oh, I-I can start over.

973
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:25,010
The Ren Fair opens in an hour.

974
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,610
You know what? Forget it.

975
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:29,120
It's not like folks come to
this tent for the food anyways.

976
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:30,480
I'm sorry?

977
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:33,520
They come for the lusty wenches.

978
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:35,920
[SCOFFS] I'm...

979
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:37,720
I'm a witch.

980
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:40,370
Okay, well, as long as
it's a lusty witch, okay?

981
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:47,400
