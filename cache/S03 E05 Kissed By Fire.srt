1
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,705
Lord,

2
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:04,958
cast your light upon us.

3
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:07,044
All: Lord of light, defend us.

4
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,049
Show us the truth.

5
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,551
Strike this man down if he is guilty.

6
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,887
Give strength to his sword if he is true.

7
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:20,891
Lord of light, give us wisdom,

8
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:29,941
For the night is dark and full of terrors.

9
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:32,736
All: For the night is
dark and full of terrors.

10
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:56,319
Get back.

11
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:30,103
All: Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.
Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.

12
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:34,733
Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.
Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.

13
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,109
- Guilty.
- Kill him!

14
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,380
Lord, cast your
light upon this man, your servant.

15
00:04:57,464 --> 00:05:00,884
Bring him back from
death and darkness. Restore his flame.

16
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,696
For the night is dark and full of terrors.

17
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,722
- Lord, cast...
- Arya, don't!

18
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:08,225
Thoros: Bring him back
from death and darkness...

19
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:12,979
No! Let go of me! Let me go!

20
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:16,149
Looks like their god
likes me more than your butcher's boy.

21
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:17,859
Burn in hell!

22
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:20,111
Beric: He will.

23
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,117
But not today.

24
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:53,186
Orell says there are crows
patrolling on the wall.

25
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,396
Tell me what you know.

26
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:59,484
There are four to a patrol, two
builders to check for structural damage,

27
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:01,152
two rangers to watch for enemies.

28
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:02,904
How often do these patrols go out?

29
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:06,032
It varies.

30
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:08,556
If I knew where on the wall
we were heading, I could tell you.

31
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:09,786
You'd like to know that.

32
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,500
There are 19 castles guarding the wall.

33
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,504
How many are manned?

34
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,007
Three.

35
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,383
You sure of that?

36
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,637
Which three?

37
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:31,975
Castle black.

38
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,019
Aye, castle black.

39
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:35,979
Everyone knows castle black.

40
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,856
Which others?

41
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:47,657
Eastwatch-by-the-sea and the shadow tower.

42
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,829
How many men remain in castle black?

43
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:54,497
- A thousand.
- Liar.

44
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,835
What happens to your
eagle after I kill you?

45
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,504
Does he drift away
like a kite with his strings cut,

46
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,649
or does he just flop dead to the ground?

47
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,091
He's no crow.

48
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:07,636
Just 'cause you want him
inside, you don't make him one of us.

49
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:09,179
I'm not afraid of you.

50
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,355
I like you, boy.

51
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:24,361
But if you lie to me, I'll pull
your guts out through your throat.

52
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,199
A thousand men.

53
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,873
We'll find out soon enough.

54
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,757
I don't need you to protect me.

55
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,133
Of course you do.

56
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:49,886
Who stopped rattleshirt
when he was about to cut your throat?

57
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,680
Who vouched for you with mance?

58
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,891
It seems you owe me a debt.

59
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,435
Give it back.

60
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,728
Well, I stole it.

61
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:02,190
It's mine. If you want
it, come steal it back.

62
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:05,986
Yg ritte!

63
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:09,280
Yg ritte!

64
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:15,620
Ygritte! Seven hells.

65
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,539
Yg ritte!

66
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:25,422
Is orell right? Are you still a crow?

67
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:29,592
It's time you proved yourself.

68
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,387
Ygritte.

69
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,847
You swore some vows.

70
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:36,558
I want you to break 'em.

71
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,813
I want you to see me.

72
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:46,359
All of me.

73
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:02,083
We shouldn't.

74
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,337
We should.

75
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:30,278
Why are you still dressed?
You know nothing, Jon snow.

76
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:50,048
That thing you did with your mouth...

77
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,469
Is that what lords
do to their ladies in the south?

78
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,389
I don't know.
I just wanted to kiss you there is all.

79
00:09:58,473 --> 00:09:59,516
Hmm.

80
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:01,559
You seemed to like it.

81
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:03,978
Aye, I liked it some.

82
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:05,980
Who taught you that?

83
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:08,775
There's been no one else. Only you.

84
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:12,362
A maid. You were a maid.

85
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:15,240
I was a man of the night's watch.

86
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,285
How about you? Were you a maid?

87
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:20,662
What do you think?

88
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,205
Who was he?

89
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,790
Just a boy.

90
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,334
He came trading with his brothers.

91
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:29,879
He had red hair like
me. Kissed by fire. But...

92
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:35,593
He was weak. Not like you.

93
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:39,889
That was the first one.
Then there was this thenn boy.

94
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:42,976
Spoke no common,
but, gods, he was built like a mammoth...

95
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:46,062
Yeah, thanks.
I think I've heard enough.

96
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:50,817
We'd best get back.

97
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,819
Tormund...

98
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:57,740
I'm not done with you yet.

99
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,916
How long's it been since you had a bath?

100
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,767
Let's not go back.

101
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:28,605
Let's stay here a while longer.

102
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:34,652
I don't ever want to
leave this cave, Jon snow.

103
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,364
Not ever.

104
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:50,543
Hound: I want my gold.

105
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:53,630
It says clearly on that
note, you'll be paid when the war is over.

106
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,007
Piss on that! You're nothing but thieves.

107
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:59,719
We're outlaws. Outlaws
steal. You're lucky we didn't kill you.

108
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:02,555
Come try it, Archer.
I'll shove those arrows up your ass.

109
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,891
You can't let him go.
He's a murderer. He's guilty.

110
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,476
Not in the eyes of god.

111
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,602
- You can't!
- Enough!

112
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:10,188
Beric: The judgment isn't ours to make.

113
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:17,820
Go in peace, sandor clegane.
The lord of light isn't done with you yet.

114
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,244
Man: Riders coming through!

115
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:37,966
Man: The kingslayer.

116
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:39,133
Down!

117
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:40,843
On your knees.

118
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:44,472
Lord Bolton, I give you the kingslayer.

119
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:47,850
Pick him up, Locke.

120
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,109
You've lost a hand.

121
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:59,612
No, my lord, he has it here.

122
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,324
Take this away.

123
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,492
Send it to his father?

124
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:07,578
You'll hold your tongue
unless you want to lose it.

125
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:08,746
Cut her free.

126
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:12,500
Apologies, my lady.
You're under my protection now.

127
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,461
Thank you, my lord.

128
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:20,341
Find suitable rooms for our guests.

129
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:22,885
We'll speak later.

130
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,055
Lord Bolton.

131
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:31,978
Is there word from the capital?

132
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:34,731
You haven't heard?

133
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,443
Stannis Baratheon laid siege
to king's landing.

134
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:44,657
Sailed into Blackwater bay.
Stormed the gates with thousands of men.

135
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,744
And your sister...

136
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,084
How can I put this?

137
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,172
Your sister...

138
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,258
Is alive and well.

139
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:05,178
Your father's forces prevailed.

140
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,014
Ser Jaime isn't well.

141
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,517
Take him to beurn.

142
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,121
Will I die?

143
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:36,292
The corruption has spread.
I fear it must be cutaway.

144
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,046
The safest course
would be to take the whole arm off.

145
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,964
Then you'll die.

146
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,511
You're no maester.

147
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,679
Where's your chain?

148
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,474
The citadel stripped me of it.

149
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:56,646
They found some of my experiments too bold.

150
00:14:56,729 --> 00:15:00,191
I can leave your upper arm,
make the cut at your elbow.

151
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,652
I don't need my right hand to kill you.

152
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:07,740
I can take away the rotting flesh

153
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:11,035
and try and burn
out the corruption with boiling wine.

154
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:12,578
Mmm.

155
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:14,872
With any luck, that will suffice.

156
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:17,333
You'll need milk of the poppy.

157
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:19,585
No milk of the poppy.

158
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:20,837
There will be pain.

159
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:22,547
I'll scream.

160
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:23,881
Quite a bit of pain.

161
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:25,967
I'll scream loudly.

162
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,628
Cersei: Lord baelish.

163
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:04,046
Your grace.

164
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,730
I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.

165
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,300
Of course, your grace.

166
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:10,970
I believe that house Tyrell don't hold the
crown's best interests at heart.

167
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:15,683
I see. And have you
shared these suspicions with lord tywin?

168
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:18,352
My father's a practical man.
He appreciates facts.

169
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:20,980
Myself, I often find them a hindrance.

170
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:24,233
And he appreciates
those who aid his family, as you well know.

171
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:26,569
He's almost as generous
to those who help us

172
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:28,988
as he is unpleasant
towards those who don't.

173
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,491
You have a good
working relationship with the tyrells.

174
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:34,577
I thought you might
look into it before you leave the capital.

175
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,579
- I shall do my best.
- Thank you.

176
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,414
And your best will prove better than

177
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:40,291
when I asked you to locate Arya stark?

178
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:41,918
I assure you that it will.

179
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,761
Gods, boy, that's enough.
We're not in a tavern.

180
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,113
- Pardon, my lady.
- No need to speak.

181
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,264
Are there any figs? Fetch some.

182
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:58,935
I always take figs
midafternoon. They help move the bowels.

183
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,062
To what do I owe this summons?

184
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,147
Thank you for seeing me, my lady.

185
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:05,358
I had hoped we might discuss
a few financial matters.

186
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:09,111
I climbed all those steps
to discuss financial matters?

187
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:11,822
It's the royal wedding.
I'm told you had a hand in planning it.

188
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:13,533
Naturally.

189
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:15,660
It's shaping up to be
a very involved affair.

190
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:17,620
The word "extravagant" has been used.

191
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:19,455
What good is the word "extravagant"

192
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,958
if it can't be used
to describe a royal wedding?

193
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,876
- I understand that.
- Good.

194
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,962
But, as master of coin, it falls upon me

195
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:28,047
to calculate the cost for the crown.

196
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,675
As of now, it's a huge expense.

197
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:31,842
And?

198
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,638
And we're at war, lady olenna.

199
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,974
Oh, I'd nearly forgotten.

200
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,517
And maintaining supply lines...

201
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:41,143
I can't think how it slipped my mind.

202
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:45,565
What is it, 12,000
infantrymen the Tyrell family has supplied?

203
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:50,069
1,800 mounted lances. 2,000 in support.

204
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:53,155
Provisions, so this city
might survive the winter.

205
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,657
A million bushels of wheat.

206
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,327
Half a million bushels each
of barley, oats, and rye.

207
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:01,706
20,000 head of cattle. 50,000 sheep.

208
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,250
You don't have to lecture me
about wartime expenses.

209
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,210
I'm quite familiar with them.

210
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:07,980
And we are grateful for your contributions,

211
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:10,590
which are necessary
for the preservation of the realm.

212
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:12,758
As is a royal wedding.

213
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:15,261
The people are hungry
for more than just food.

214
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,637
They crave distractions.

215
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:20,057
And if we don't provide them,
they'll create their own.

216
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:22,518
And their distractions are likely to

217
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,979
end with us being torn to pieces.

218
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:28,566
A royal wedding is much
safer. Wouldn't you say?

219
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:30,359
I would.

220
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:34,530
And traditionally paid
for by the royal family.

221
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:40,369
I was told you were drunk,
impertinent, and thoroughly debauched.

222
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,538
Imagine my disappointment at finding

223
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:44,790
nothing but a browbeaten bookkeeper.

224
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:48,461
Where did you go for them, volantis?

225
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:51,881
- My lady...
- Oh, very well.

226
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:55,968
I won't have it said
that house Tyrell refuses to play its part.

227
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:59,263
We'll pay for half,
and the celebrations will go on as planned.

228
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:02,308
- Is that sufficient?
- Quite. Thank you.

229
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,435
Very good, then. That's settled. Good day.

230
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,607
Give me that.

231
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:16,405
Arya: What are you doing?

232
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,116
Just mending lord beric's armor.

233
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,080
I'm going to stay and Smith
for the brotherhood.

234
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,082
Have you lost your mind?

235
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:28,084
When the lannisters find this place,

236
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:29,627
you think they'll spare the smiths?

237
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,170
They'll cave your head in.

238
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,964
They wanted to kill me
long before I joined the brotherhood.

239
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:35,424
You don't have to.

240
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:39,303
I want to. They need good men.

241
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:42,598
Robb needs good men, too.
We're leaving tomorrow.

242
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:43,724
And then you...

243
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:44,892
What? Serve him?

244
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,604
I've served men my entire life.

245
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:53,109
I served master mott at king's landing,
and he sold me to the watch.

246
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:54,985
I served lord tywin at harrenhal,

247
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:58,447
wondering every day
if I'd get tortured or killed.

248
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,785
- I'm done serving.
- You just said you were serving lord beric.

249
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:07,123
He may be their leader, but they chose him.

250
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:10,793
These men are brothers. They're a family.

251
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:14,463
I've never had a family.

252
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,093
I can be your family.

253
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:26,600
You wouldn't be my family.
You'd be "my lady."

254
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,329
Willem.

255
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:51,333
Willem!

256
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,255
Is this a rescue?

257
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,965
Lannister filth! Take him!

258
00:20:58,048 --> 00:20:59,192
Please, I didn't do anything.

259
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:00,551
I'm just a squire. Please...

260
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:16,358
Bring them in.

261
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,293
Is that all of them?

262
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,673
It took five of you
to murder two unarmed squires?

263
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:43,177
Not murder, your grace. Vengeance.

264
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,720
Vengeance?

265
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:48,641
Those boys didn't kill your sons.

266
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:51,310
I saw harrion die
on the battlefield, and torrhen...

267
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:53,479
Was strangled by the kingslayer.

268
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,481
- They were his kin.
- They were boys!

269
00:21:58,067 --> 00:21:59,401
Look at them.

270
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,890
Tell your mother to look at them.

271
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,366
She killed them as much as I.

272
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:09,829
My mother had nothing to do with
this. This was your treason.

273
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:11,747
It's treason to free your enemies.

274
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:14,250
In war, you kill your enemies.

275
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,933
Did your father not teach you that, boy?

276
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:18,587
Leave him.

277
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:26,971
Leave me to the king.

278
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:30,432
He wants to give me
a scolding before he sets me free.

279
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:37,439
That's how he
deals with treason. Our king in the north.

280
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:38,983
Or should I call him

281
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:42,778
the king who lost the north?

282
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:49,910
Escort lord karstark
to the dungeon. Hang the rest.

283
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:52,872
Mercy! I didn't kill
anyone. I only watched for the guards.

284
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:54,155
This one was only the watcher.

285
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,376
Hang him last, so he
can watch the others die.

286
00:22:57,459 --> 00:23:03,757
Please! Please, no. They made me do it!
They made me! They made me!

287
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,059
Word of this can't leave riverrun.

288
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:15,853
They were tywin Lannister's nephews.

289
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:17,730
The lannisters pay their debts.

290
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,273
They never stop talking about it.

291
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:20,816
Would you make me a liar as well?

292
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:22,818
It wouldn't be lying.

293
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:26,238
We will Bury them
and remain silent until the war is done.

294
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:27,656
I'm not fighting forjustice

295
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:30,659
if I don't serve justice
to murderers in my ranks,

296
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:32,703
no matter how highborn.

297
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:36,165
He has to die.

298
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:41,170
The karstarks are northmen. They
won't forgive the killing of their lord.

299
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:46,008
Your mother's right. If you do this,
the karstarks will abandon you.

300
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:48,010
You tended to their wounds.

301
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:51,013
You brought them supper. Now they're dead.

302
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:54,350
And more boys will keep dying
until this war is over.

303
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,185
You need karstark men to end it.

304
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:59,521
Spare his life. Keep him as a hostage.

305
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:00,731
A hostage.

306
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:06,779
Tell the karstarks that as long as they're
loyal, he will not be harmed.

307
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:34,556
The blood of the first men flows through

308
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:37,101
my veins as much as yours, boy.

309
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:41,021
I fought the mad king for your father.

310
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,816
I fought Joffrey for you.

311
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:48,612
We are kin, stark and karstark.

312
00:24:48,696 --> 00:24:52,658
That didn't stop you from betraying
me, and it won't save you now.

313
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:58,914
I don't want it to save me. I want it
to haunt you to the end of your days.

314
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:02,167
Kneel, my lord.

315
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:15,139
Rickard karstark, lord of karhold,

316
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:18,475
here, in sight of gods and
men, I sentence you to die.

317
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,145
Would you speak a final word?

318
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:26,775
Kill me and be cursed.
You are no king of mine.

319
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,126
Arya: Joffrey.

320
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,837
Cersei.

321
00:25:48,756 --> 00:25:50,632
Ilyn Payne.

322
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:54,136
Ser meryn.

323
00:25:57,431 --> 00:25:59,183
The hound.

324
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,688
What are you going to do with me?

325
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:09,234
At first light we'll ride for
riverrun. Your brother's there now.

326
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:13,447
He'll make a contribution to our
cause, and you can go home.

327
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:16,325
I'm a hostage and you're selling me.

328
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,826
Don't think of it that way.

329
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,161
But it is that way.

330
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,496
It is.

331
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:21,872
And it isn't.

332
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:23,123
More is than isn't.

333
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:28,629
Beric admired your father
a great deal, you know.

334
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:30,631
He wanted to refuse your ransom altogether.

335
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,257
So, why don't you?

336
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:33,967
We need the gold.

337
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:47,898
Do I frighten you, child?

338
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:55,114
You're angry with me,
and I don't blame you,

339
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:57,533
but letting him go was the right thing.

340
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,119
I have more reason to want him hanged.

341
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:01,328
I thought he killed you.

342
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:02,621
He did.

343
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:04,373
But how...

344
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:08,627
Thoros, how many times
have you brought me back?

345
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:11,880
It's the lord of light who brings you back.

346
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:14,716
I'm just the lucky drunk
who says the words.

347
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,926
How many times?

348
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,219
Five, I think.

349
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,762
No, this makes six.

350
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,680
Six.

351
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:22,891
There was the first time. The mountain.

352
00:27:24,101 --> 00:27:25,144
Show her.

353
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,771
Lance right through the chest.

354
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:31,525
Beric: Then I was stabbed in the belly.

355
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,277
Then it was an arrow in the back.

356
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,696
And that ax in the side.

357
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:39,074
Then the lannisters caught me
and executed me for treason.

358
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:42,744
Was it a hanging or a dagger in the eye?

359
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:45,956
Both. Fuckers couldn't decide.

360
00:27:46,874 --> 00:27:48,250
And the hound makes six.

361
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,836
Second time I've been killed by a clegane.

362
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,754
Thoros: You'd think you'd learn.

363
00:27:54,548 --> 00:27:57,092
It's not getting any easier, you know.

364
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:59,052
Beric: I know.

365
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:01,180
Every time I come back,

366
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,140
I'm a bit less.

367
00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:07,144
Pieces of you get chipped away.

368
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:10,939
Could you bring back a man without a head?

369
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:16,778
Not six times. Just once.

370
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:19,615
I don't think it works that way, child.

371
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:31,627
He was a good man, ned stark.
He's at rest now, somewhere.

372
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:34,630
I would never wish my life upon him.

373
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:36,506
I would.

374
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,136
You're alive.

375
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:49,478
Selyse: Lord, cast your light upon me.

376
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:53,106
Protect me in the darkness.

377
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:56,235
Burn away my sins.

378
00:28:57,402 --> 00:29:00,030
Help me serve you.

379
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:02,908
Use me as you will.

380
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:09,790
For the night is dark and full of terrors.

381
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:24,096
I have prayed day and night
for you to come to me.

382
00:29:26,056 --> 00:29:27,975
My lady.

383
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:29,893
I meant to come sooner.

384
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:32,521
The battle...

385
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:34,106
I know of your troubles, my king.

386
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:36,775
The lady melisandre has told me everything.

387
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,069
Yes, of course.

388
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:53,417
You mustn't despair.
Your claim is true. You will be victorious.

389
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,626
I believed that once.

390
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:00,465
You are the one god's champion
and the finest man I've ever known.

391
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:01,633
Selyse.

392
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:06,346
I've broken a sacred vow.

393
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:11,560
I've sinned.

394
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:14,688
I've wronged you.

395
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,231
I have shamed you.

396
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:18,275
You're doing god's work.

397
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:19,735
You don't understand.

398
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:28,285
The red woman...

399
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:31,580
The lady melisandre...

400
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:32,914
I know, Stannis.

401
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:37,085
The lady melisandre has told me everything.

402
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:42,299
No act done in service
of the lord of light can ever be a sin.

403
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:46,094
When she told me,

404
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:51,224
I wept with joy.

405
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:05,655
Oh, my sweet boys.

406
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:12,621
Petyr, tommard, edric.

407
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:20,253
I thank god every day
for bringing melisandre to us.

408
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:22,881
She gave you a son.

409
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,386
I gave you

410
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:30,347
- nothing.
- That's not true.

411
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:38,146
So, you've come to see her as well?

412
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,526
There is no need.

413
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:46,405
You must keep away from such distractions.

414
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:47,948
She's my daughter.

415
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:51,576
I want to see her.

416
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:58,625
You are a king.
You don't need my permission.

417
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:08,844
Girl: The sea I know, I know

418
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:11,513
oh, oh, oh

419
00:32:12,222 --> 00:32:14,850
the birds have scales

420
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:18,019
and the fish take wing

421
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:20,939
I know, I know

422
00:32:21,565 --> 00:32:24,025
oh, oh, oh

423
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:25,944
Stannis: Shireen.

424
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:27,529
Father!

425
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,147
You've grown since I last saw you.

426
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,708
Mother said you fought in a battle.

427
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:42,711
Did you win?

428
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:48,425
Did the onion knight come back with you?

429
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:53,722
He did. He fought bravely.

430
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,557
He hasn't come to visit me.

431
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:58,685
He said he'd bring
me back a present from the capital.

432
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:00,312
He won't be visiting, child.

433
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:02,814
Why not? He's my friend.

434
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:04,399
Look.

435
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:13,658
He made this for me.

436
00:33:14,201 --> 00:33:17,454
But don't tell mother
I have it. It's a secret.

437
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:20,540
Mother doesn't like the onion knight.

438
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:25,712
Ser davos is a traitor.

439
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:30,258
He's rotting in a
dungeon cell for his crime.

440
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:41,770
Best forget him.

441
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:56,493
Not so hard. You'll scrub the skin off.

442
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:57,786
What are you doing here?

443
00:33:57,953 --> 00:33:59,162
I need a bath.

444
00:33:59,663 --> 00:34:01,623
Help me out of these rags.

445
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:09,756
Now get out.

446
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,313
There's another tub.

447
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,316
Jaime: This one suits me fine.

448
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:43,873
Don't worry. I'm not interested.

449
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:48,712
If I faint, pull me out.

450
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:52,299
I don't intend to be
the first Lannister to die in a bathtub.

451
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:54,092
Why should I care how you die?

452
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:56,886
You swore a solemn vow, remember?

453
00:34:57,429 --> 00:35:00,932
You're supposed to
get me to king's landing in one piece.

454
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:03,143
Not going so well, is it?

455
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:06,865
No wonder renly died,
with you guarding him.

456
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:19,367
That was unworthy. Forgive me.

457
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:21,971
- You protected me better than most...
- Don't you mock me.

458
00:35:21,995 --> 00:35:23,830
I'm apologizing.

459
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:29,002
I'm sick of fighting. Let's call a truce.

460
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:30,879
You need trust to have a truce.

461
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,799
I trust you.

462
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:44,643
There it is. There's the look.

463
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:48,730
I've seen it for 17
years, on face after face.

464
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:51,816
You all despise me.

465
00:35:52,025 --> 00:35:55,779
Kingslayer. Oathbreaker.

466
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:58,573
A man without honor.

467
00:36:04,788 --> 00:36:06,081
You've heard of wildfire?

468
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:07,540
Of course.

469
00:36:07,624 --> 00:36:10,335
The mad king was obsessed with it.

470
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:13,505
He loved to watch people burn,

471
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:18,218
the way their skin blackened and
blistered and melted off their bones.

472
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:20,345
He burned lords he didn't like.

473
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:22,514
He burned hands who disobeyed him.

474
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:25,684
He burned anyone who was against him.

475
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:30,689
Before long, half the
country was against him.

476
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:36,152
Aerys saw traitors everywhere,

477
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:43,326
so he had his pyromancer
place caches of wildfire all over the city,

478
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:48,289
beneath the sept of baelor
and the slums of flea bottom.

479
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:51,626
Under houses, stables, taverns.

480
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:54,295
Even beneath the red keep itself.

481
00:36:56,881 --> 00:37:02,137
Finally, the day of reckoning came.

482
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:04,723
Robert Baratheon marched on the capital

483
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:07,058
after his victory at the trident.

484
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:12,272
But my father arrived first,
with the whole Lannister army at his back,

485
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:16,151
promising to defend the city
against the rebels.

486
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:20,822
I knew my father better than that.

487
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:23,158
He's never been one
to pick the losing side.

488
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:26,327
I told the mad king as much.

489
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:30,331
I urged him to surrender peacefully.

490
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,834
But the king didn't listen to me.

491
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:36,212
He didn't listen to varys,
who tried to warn him.

492
00:37:36,296 --> 00:37:40,300
But he did listen to grand maester pycelle,

493
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:43,094
that gray, sunken cunt.

494
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:47,348
"You can trust the lannisters," he said.

495
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:53,688
"The lannisters have always
been true friends of the crown."

496
00:37:56,065 --> 00:38:00,904
So, we opened the gates,
and my father sacked the city.

497
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:07,577
Once again, I came to the
king, begging him to surrender.

498
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:16,294
He told me to bring him my father's head.

499
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:21,549
Then he turned to his pyromancer.

500
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:25,637
"Burn them all," he said.

501
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:31,518
"Burn them in their homes.
Burn them in their beds."

502
00:38:33,186 --> 00:38:37,816
Tell me, if your precious renly

503
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:40,777
commanded you to kill your own father

504
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,279
and stand by while thousands of men,

505
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:45,824
women, and children burned alive,

506
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:47,575
would you have done it?

507
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,453
Would you have kept your oath then?

508
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:57,794
First, I killed the pyromancer.

509
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:02,257
And then, when the king turned to ere,

510
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:05,760
I drove my sword into his back.

511
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:10,431
"Burn them all,"
he kept saying. "Burn them all."

512
00:39:11,224 --> 00:39:13,351
I don't think he expected to die.

513
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:20,692
He meant to burn with the rest of us

514
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:23,194
and rise again,

515
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:26,823
reborn as a dragon to
turn his enemies to ash.

516
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:34,330
I slit his throat to
make sure that didn't happen.

517
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:41,462
That's where ned stark found me.

518
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:44,340
If this is true...

519
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:47,802
Why didn't you tell anyone?

520
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:51,764
Why didn't you tell lord stark?

521
00:39:51,848 --> 00:39:52,932
Stark?

522
00:39:53,349 --> 00:40:00,064
You think the honorable ned stark

523
00:40:00,148 --> 00:40:02,317
wanted to hear my side?

524
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:08,448
He judged me guilty
the moment he set eyes on me.

525
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:17,123
By what right does the wolfjudge the lion?

526
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:20,335
- By what right?
- Help! Help!

527
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,337
The kingslayer!

528
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:27,175
Jaime. My name is Jaime.

529
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:34,974
Shireen:
Onion knight. Ser onion knight.

530
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:38,436
Princess? Gods, what are you doing here?

531
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:39,687
Shh! You'll wake Bert.

532
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:43,650
He's the fat one. He's
on guard duty tonight.

533
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:46,152
He likes to drink wine and sleep a lot.

534
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:48,863
Go back to your room.
You're not supposed to be here.

535
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:51,067
- If your father knew...
- He said you were a traitor.

536
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:52,825
Are you?

537
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:54,702
I am, child.

538
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:59,457
I disobeyed my king,
your father, and now I'm paying the price.

539
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:02,085
I don't care. You're my friend.

540
00:41:02,377 --> 00:41:05,964
You must get bored
down here. I brought you something to read.

541
00:41:06,506 --> 00:41:08,716
It's about aegon and his dragons.

542
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:11,010
Aegon used to live here. Did you know that?

543
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:12,971
- And the targaryens built this castle.
- Aye.

544
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:14,222
So they did.

545
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:15,824
You can hide the book under your cloak.

546
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:17,892
It's a good one. I'll bring you more.

547
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:20,812
Thank you, my lady.
I'm sure it's a fine book,

548
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:22,814
- but it's wasted on me.
- Take it.

549
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:24,565
I have more.

550
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:27,568
My lady, I can't read the words.

551
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:30,238
You can't?

552
00:41:30,697 --> 00:41:33,057
I'll teach you. I'll come when
Bert's on duty and teach you.

553
00:41:33,116 --> 00:41:35,118
- No. No. No.
- It's easy. It'll be fun.

554
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:36,661
Go. We can't.

555
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:39,998
Why not? What will
they do, look us in cells?

556
00:41:46,713 --> 00:41:48,793
- I wouldn't know where to start.
- At the beginning.

557
00:41:50,133 --> 00:41:51,759
This word is "aegon."

558
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:56,180
When you see "a," 'e,"
and "g" together like that,

559
00:41:56,264 --> 00:41:58,099
it sounds like "egg."

560
00:41:58,182 --> 00:41:59,767
And the title of the whole book

561
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:04,272
is an history of aegon the
conqueror and his conquest of Westeros.

562
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:18,512
- Jorah: It was a bitch of a siege.
- Barristan: Mmm.

563
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,371
You were first through the breach at pyke?

564
00:42:20,455 --> 00:42:21,456
The second.

565
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:25,960
Thoros of myr went in
alone, waving that flaming sword of his.

566
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:28,755
Thoros of myr. Bloody madman.

567
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:31,883
Robert knighted you after the battle?

568
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:33,676
Proudest moment of my life.

569
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,679
One knee in the dust,
the king's sword on my shoulder,

570
00:42:36,763 --> 00:42:37,763
listening to the words,

571
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:41,392
"in the name of the warrior,
I charge you to be brave."

572
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:44,729
All I could think of
was how badly I had to piss.

573
00:42:46,147 --> 00:42:48,816
Jorah: In full plate metal for 16 hours.

574
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,780
Never occurred to me
till the fighting was over.

575
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:52,528
I was very nearly the first man

576
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:54,405
knighted to piss on the king's boots.

577
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:57,158
Robert would have laughed.

578
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:00,536
He was a good man, a great warrior.

579
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:04,290
And a terrible king.

580
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:07,752
I burned away my years
fighting for terrible kings.

581
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,504
- You swore an oath.
- Yes.

582
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:12,090
And a man of honor keeps his vows,

583
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:14,717
even if he's serving a drunk or a lunatic.

584
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:17,804
Just once in my life before it's over,

585
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:20,765
I want to know
what it's like to serve with pride,

586
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:22,975
to fight for someone I believe in.

587
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:25,394
Do you believe in her?

588
00:43:28,356 --> 00:43:29,982
With all my heart.

589
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:36,572
These are the ones?

590
00:43:36,656 --> 00:43:38,699
Yes, khaleesi. The officers.

591
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:42,912
You did not choose this life.

592
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:47,708
But you are free men now.
And free men make their own choices.

593
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:52,130
Have you selected your own leader
from amongst your ranks?

594
00:43:57,385 --> 00:43:58,469
Remove your helmet.

595
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:07,979
This one has the honor.

596
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:09,897
What is your name?

597
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:11,399
Grey worm.

598
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:13,734
Grey worm.

599
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:18,114
All unsullied boys
are given new names when they are cut.

600
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:21,450
Grey worm, red flea, black rat.

601
00:44:21,534 --> 00:44:24,287
Names that remind them what they are...

602
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:26,664
Vermin.

603
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:32,920
From this day fonnard,
you will choose your own names.

604
00:44:33,254 --> 00:44:36,382
You will tell your fellow soldiers
to do the same.

605
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:38,926
Throw away your slave name.

606
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:41,721
Choose the name your parents gave you,
or any other.

607
00:44:42,722 --> 00:44:46,350
A name that gives you pride.

608
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:51,480
"Grey worm" gives me pride.
It is a lucky name.

609
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:55,276
The name this one was born
with was cursed.

610
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:59,614
That was the name he had when he
was taken as a slave.

611
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:05,077
But grey worm is the name this one had

612
00:45:05,161 --> 00:45:09,415
the day Daenerys stormborn set him free.

613
00:45:13,878 --> 00:45:15,838
Jorah: King Robert wanted her dead.

614
00:45:15,922 --> 00:45:19,258
Of course he wanted her dead.
She's a Targaryen. The last Targaryen.

615
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:23,429
I suppose no one on the small
council could speak sense to him.

616
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:24,872
I didn't sit on the small council.

617
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:28,577
Doesn't the lord commander
of the kingsguard traditionally...

618
00:45:28,601 --> 00:45:29,810
Traditionally, yes,

619
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:32,688
but I killed a dozen
of Robert's friends during his rebellion.

620
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:36,734
He didn't want advice on how to govern

621
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:38,653
from a man who had fought for the mad king.

622
00:45:39,028 --> 00:45:40,821
Can't say I minded much.

623
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:43,908
I always hated the politics.

624
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:45,910
Yeah, I imagine I would, too.

625
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:49,288
Hours spentjabbering about
backstabbings and betrayals the world over.

626
00:45:49,372 --> 00:45:50,456
Mmm-hmm.

627
00:45:54,919 --> 00:45:56,712
Still, she'll have to
Wade through that muck

628
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:58,673
if she wants to rule the seven kingdoms.

629
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:00,508
She'll have good men around her

630
00:46:00,675 --> 00:46:02,426
to advise her, men with experience.

631
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:04,679
Which men do you have in mind?

632
00:46:04,804 --> 00:46:06,931
Forgive me for what I'm about to say,

633
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:09,433
but your reputation
in Westeros has suffered over the years.

634
00:46:10,268 --> 00:46:13,896
It suffered for a reason.
I sold men into slavery.

635
00:46:14,355 --> 00:46:16,023
I don't know if your presence by her side

636
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,900
will help our cause when we go home.

637
00:46:17,984 --> 00:46:19,944
Our cause?

638
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:22,613
Forgive me, ser barristan,
but I was busy defending the khaleesi

639
00:46:22,697 --> 00:46:24,156
against king Robert's assassins

640
00:46:24,282 --> 00:46:25,842
while you were still bowing to the man.

641
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:28,953
We both want her to rule. Am I wrong?

642
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:31,580
You onlyjoined us a few days ago.

643
00:46:31,706 --> 00:46:33,457
I can't speak to your intentions.

644
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:36,002
If we're truly her onal servants,

645
00:46:36,085 --> 00:46:38,587
we will do whatever needs to be done,

646
00:46:38,713 --> 00:46:41,215
no matter the cost, no matter our pride.

647
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:46,095
You're not lord commander
here. You're just another exile.

648
00:46:46,721 --> 00:46:48,514
And I take my orders from the queen.

649
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:58,065
Talisa: Come to bed.

650
00:46:58,357 --> 00:46:59,859
You were right.

651
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:02,403
The karstarks are gone.

652
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:05,239
Almost half our forces.

653
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:09,243
Tywin Lannister knows what he needs to
do to make us unravel.

654
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:11,662
Nothing.

655
00:47:12,455 --> 00:47:14,165
Only wait.

656
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:15,750
Don't let him.

657
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:20,546
What can I do? Attack king's landing?

658
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:24,508
There's nothing
he'd like better. He'd crush us in a day.

659
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:27,094
We could ride north.

660
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:30,306
Take your land back
from the greyjoys. Wait out the winter.

661
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:32,850
Winter could last five years.

662
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:34,435
Once my bannermen are home again,

663
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:37,146
sitting by the fire,
surrounded by their families,

664
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:40,274
warm and safe, they'll
never ride south again.

665
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:44,236
When I gathered my lords
together, we had a purpose, a mission.

666
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:47,114
Now we're like a band
of bickering children.

667
00:47:49,492 --> 00:47:51,452
Give them a new purpose.

668
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:52,953
What?

669
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:59,293
I don't know.
I don't even know where winterfell is.

670
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,048
Here.

671
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:09,053
And we're here.

672
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:10,638
King's landing...

673
00:48:17,812 --> 00:48:19,105
What is it?

674
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:25,861
I can't force them to meet us in the field

675
00:48:25,945 --> 00:48:28,155
and I can't attack them
where they're strongest,

676
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:30,214
but I can attack them where they're not.

677
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:34,036
And casterly rock can't run away.

678
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:39,500
I'm going to take their
home away from them.

679
00:48:40,793 --> 00:48:42,420
Can you do it?

680
00:48:42,837 --> 00:48:45,881
I need men to
replace the karstarks who marched home.

681
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:48,342
There is only one person in this kingdom

682
00:48:48,426 --> 00:48:51,637
with that kind of army who hasn't
already sided with the lannisters.

683
00:48:53,431 --> 00:48:55,683
The man whose daughter
I was supposed to marry.

684
00:48:57,143 --> 00:48:58,602
Walder frey.

685
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:09,947
He's such a splendid fighter.

686
00:49:10,531 --> 00:49:13,200
Do you have any idea when we might...

687
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:16,829
I'll plant the seed
as soon as Joffrey and I are married.

688
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:18,414
It should grow quickly.

689
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:22,918
Joffrey won't let me leave.
He's got too many reasons to keep me here.

690
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:25,588
And only one to let you go.

691
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:28,466
Because it will please me.

692
00:49:29,008 --> 00:49:30,885
Loras: Squire.

693
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:35,764
Well fought, ser.

694
00:49:35,848 --> 00:49:37,516
That was no fight.

695
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:38,767
I don't know you.

696
00:49:38,851 --> 00:49:41,187
Ovaer, if it please you.

697
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:46,484
I should like to
see you spar with a proper partner, ser.

698
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:55,576
How did you know?

699
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,411
Know what?

700
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:00,706
That I wanted to.

701
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:02,583
My lord...

702
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:08,398
I'll have you know I'm to be married soon,

703
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:11,008
and even my intended
hasn't the slightest notion.

704
00:50:11,634 --> 00:50:14,512
They rarely do, in my experience.

705
00:50:14,595 --> 00:50:17,181
You have a good deal of experience, do you?

706
00:50:18,224 --> 00:50:19,725
With the husbands.

707
00:50:29,068 --> 00:50:30,986
That didn't take long.

708
00:50:31,654 --> 00:50:33,572
Well, it took long enough.

709
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:38,202
It seems
our knight of flowers is engaged to be wed.

710
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:39,787
Is he?

711
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:41,413
And...

712
00:50:42,206 --> 00:50:44,041
Who's the lucky girl?

713
00:50:44,542 --> 00:50:47,461
Littlefinger: She may
not be the grandest ship in the world

714
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:49,421
or the fastest,

715
00:50:50,798 --> 00:50:52,007
but she's mine.

716
00:50:55,803 --> 00:50:59,557
I've always wanted a ship.
Now I want a dozen.

717
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:01,267
Strange, isn't it?

718
00:51:01,392 --> 00:51:02,560
What is?

719
00:51:02,643 --> 00:51:04,728
It doesn't matter what we want,

720
00:51:04,812 --> 00:51:07,815
once we get it, then
we want something else.

721
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:13,946
Your hair is different.

722
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:15,447
Is it?

723
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:17,241
Lady margaery wears it that way.

724
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:19,326
Many ladies wear it this way.

725
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,664
I have good news. I'll
be leaving the city soon.

726
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:25,100
You still want me to come with you?

727
00:51:25,124 --> 00:51:28,335
It's not a question of what
I want. It's what you want.

728
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:30,796
You want to go home, don't you?

729
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:33,132
Of course. More than anything.

730
00:51:35,676 --> 00:51:38,679
But maybe it would be better to wait.

731
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:43,976
I've been thinking how dangerous it would
be. Not just for me, but for you.

732
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:48,731
You've been so kind. I'd feel
terrible if anything happened to you.

733
00:51:49,982 --> 00:51:51,859
I can't tell you how touched I am

734
00:51:52,026 --> 00:51:53,944
by your concern for my welfare.

735
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:58,365
I hope you know that
I'm your friend, sansa.

736
00:51:59,158 --> 00:52:00,951
Your true friend.

737
00:52:01,035 --> 00:52:02,202
I do, lord baelish.

738
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:03,621
Petyr.

739
00:52:03,746 --> 00:52:04,872
Petyr.

740
00:52:04,997 --> 00:52:09,960
If you wish to stay,
then of course you will stay.

741
00:52:15,049 --> 00:52:17,468
We'll speak again when I return.

742
00:52:30,648 --> 00:52:32,066
Tywin: You're late.

743
00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:34,902
What's she doing here?

744
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:37,404
Our business concerns her, too.

745
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:39,114
Sit.

746
00:52:41,325 --> 00:52:43,577
You'll be pleased to learn that

747
00:52:43,744 --> 00:52:45,996
after one conversation with olenna Tyrell,

748
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:50,834
I've saved the crown
hundreds of thousands on this wedding.

749
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:53,545
Never mind that now.
We have something important to discuss.

750
00:52:53,629 --> 00:52:55,881
I'm master of coin.
Saving money is important.

751
00:52:57,091 --> 00:53:00,260
Stop that. You're making me uncomfortable.

752
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:03,347
Your sister has learned
that your new friends the tyrells

753
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:06,308
are plotting to marry
sansa stark to ser loras.

754
00:53:06,809 --> 00:53:09,770
Very well. She's a lovely girl.

755
00:53:10,396 --> 00:53:14,024
Missing some of loras' favorite
bits, but I'm sure they'll make do.

756
00:53:14,108 --> 00:53:15,359
Yourjokes are not appreciated.

757
00:53:15,484 --> 00:53:16,735
It wasn't my best, but...

758
00:53:16,819 --> 00:53:19,863
I bring them into the royal fold,
and this is how they repay me,

759
00:53:19,947 --> 00:53:22,616
by trying to steal
the key to the north out from under me.

760
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:27,371
Sansa is the key to the north? I seem to
remember she has an older brother.

761
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:29,289
The karstarks have marched home.

762
00:53:29,373 --> 00:53:32,501
The young wolf has
lost half his army. His days are numbered.

763
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,421
Theon greyjoy murdered both his brothers.

764
00:53:35,504 --> 00:53:38,882
That makes sansa
stark the heir to winterfell,

765
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:42,720
and I am not about
to hand her over to the tyrells.

766
00:53:42,803 --> 00:53:45,139
Tyrion: The Tyrell army is
helping us to win this war.

767
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:47,808
Do you really think it's
wise to refuse them?

768
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:49,810
There's nothing to refuse. This is a plot.

769
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:52,563
Plots are not public knowledge.

770
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:56,567
And the tyrells won't carry this one out
until after Joffrey's wedding.

771
00:53:56,650 --> 00:54:00,320
We need to act first
and kill this union in its crib.

772
00:54:00,529 --> 00:54:01,780
And how do we do that?

773
00:54:01,864 --> 00:54:04,032
We find sansa stark a different husband.

774
00:54:04,116 --> 00:54:05,284
Wonderful.

775
00:54:05,409 --> 00:54:06,618
Yes, it is.

776
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:15,919
You can't mean it.

777
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:17,254
I can and I do.

778
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:20,090
Joffrey's made this
poor girl's life miserable

779
00:54:20,215 --> 00:54:22,926
since the day he took her father's head.

780
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:25,596
Now she's finally
free of him, and you give her to me?

781
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:27,055
That's cruel, even for you.

782
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:28,557
Do you intend on mistreating her?

783
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:32,227
The girl's happiness
is not my concern, nor yours.

784
00:54:32,311 --> 00:54:33,604
She's a child!

785
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:36,367
She's flowered, I assure
you. She and I have discussed it at length.

786
00:54:36,482 --> 00:54:38,025
There, you see? You will wed her,

787
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:39,693
bed her, and put a child in her.

788
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:41,570
Surely you're capable of that.

789
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:42,946
And if I refuse?

790
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:45,365
You wanted to be rewarded
for your valor in battle.

791
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:50,037
Sansa stark is a finer
reward than you could ever dare hope for.

792
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,247
And it is past time you were wed.

793
00:54:52,331 --> 00:54:53,832
I was wed.

794
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:56,877
Or don't you remember?

795
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:01,006
Only too well.

796
00:55:02,049 --> 00:55:06,345
You should be thanking the gods for this.
This is more than you deserve.

797
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:10,766
Tyrion will do as he's bid. As will you.

798
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:14,394
What do you mean?

799
00:55:14,478 --> 00:55:16,271
You'll marry ser loras.

800
00:55:18,899 --> 00:55:19,900
I will not.

801
00:55:20,067 --> 00:55:21,127
The boy is heir to highgarden.

802
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:23,612
Tyrion will secure the north,
you will secure the reach.

803
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:25,113
No, I won't do it.

804
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:26,698
Yes, you will.

805
00:55:26,782 --> 00:55:29,076
You're still fertile.
You need to marry again and breed.

806
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:31,161
I am queen regent, not some broodmare.

807
00:55:31,245 --> 00:55:32,746
You're my daughter!

808
00:55:34,081 --> 00:55:37,960
You will do as I command,
and you will marry loras Tyrell

809
00:55:38,377 --> 00:55:42,256
and put an end to the disgusting
rumors about you once and for all.

810
00:55:43,257 --> 00:55:44,901
Father, don't make me do it again, please.

811
00:55:44,925 --> 00:55:46,426
Not another word.

812
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:49,096
My children.

813
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:54,643
You've disgraced
the Lannister name for far too long.
