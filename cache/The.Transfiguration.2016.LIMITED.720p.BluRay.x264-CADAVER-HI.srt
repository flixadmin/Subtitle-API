- No.
- Really?

that kind of stuff all the time.

I mean, it's no big deal. I just had to go.

Not really. I can't kill myself.

- Yeah. I can't.

No, my grandfather. He's pretty awful.

I mean, I guess the best thing about him
is that... that he's slow,

Yeah. My dad died when I was like, eight,

It took a long time for him to die,

221
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:47,164
It's just, I bet the vampires in Twilight
aren't very realistic.

222
00:29:47,244 --> 00:29:49,333
There's no such thing as a realistic vampire.

223
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:52,836
There is. I mean, more realistic.

224
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:55,784
I mean, vampires don't twinkle.

225
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:59,635
Okay. So... So, what are vampires like?

226
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:04,097
Well, I think it starts
with drinking blood, like...

227
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:06,141
Like, you have a need to.

228
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:09,895
It's like... It's like when you have a cut
on your finger when you're a little kid,

229
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:13,023
and you're sucking it,
but eventually that's not good enough,

230
00:30:13,103 --> 00:30:16,068
so you... so you switch to animals
and stuff like that,

231
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:18,570
and then, you know, people, and...

232
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:22,199
And you change a lot
after the first person you kill,

233
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:27,195
and you change a lot more after...
after one after another.

234
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:31,959
But I think when you first start off
being a vampire, all the...

235
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:34,586
all the stuff you see in the movies
doesn't really matter.

236
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:37,339
Like, you can go out in the sun
and you can eat garlic,

237
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:40,467
and I don't even think
the church stuff is even true.

238
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:42,511
Like, maybe to religious vampires, you know?

239
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:44,972
And I don't think you get bit.

240
00:30:45,052 --> 00:30:48,261
I think it's like a...
it's like a disease you get.

241
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:51,131
Wow. Which book is this?

242
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:55,399
It's not a book, it's just how I think it is.

243
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:57,985
Vampires existed before books did.

244
00:30:58,065 --> 00:31:00,648
Well, the sun kills them in True Blood.

245
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:05,075
I did not watch that show. It did not look
like it was gonna be realistic at all.

246
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:06,952
Oh, my God, you should. It's so good.

247
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:12,124
In this one... erm, in this one episode,
the vampire that makes Eric

248
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:16,378
starts feeling, like, really bad
about what he does, so he kills himself.

249
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:20,048
He like, goes up on a roof,
I think, and then...

250
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:22,962
and then the sun comes up and just kills him.

251
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:28,432
I mean, it could be true, but I don't think
a vampire can kill himself.

252
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:32,144
- Why not?
- I don't know. It's like a...

253
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:34,557
it's like an animal instinct.

254
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:38,066
So, they get to live forever?

255
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:40,684
Maybe. I don't know yet.

SOPHIE: What do you mean?

260
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:06,011

and he doesn't like to talk about it.

264

I don't think that's a good idea. He...

He doesn't want to talk about her.

you can come with me to mine. Deal?

So, what's your favourite vampire movie?

307
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:12,489
I guess the most realistic.
Like, I like Martin a lot.

308
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:15,992
It's a '70s one and it's... it's good.
It's... it's realistic.

309
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:19,538
And Near Dark is really good.
It's pretty cool and realistic.

Let the Right One In.

311
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:25,418
I'm not sure how realistic it is.
I mean, like, she can climb on walls,

312
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:29,005
and I think maybe
they're just really good climbers.

And Shadow of the Vampire is...
It's good. It's pretty cool and realistic.
