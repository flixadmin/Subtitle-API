1
01:20:02,803 --> 01:20:04,183
Dad, look.

2
01:23:49,655 --> 01:23:55,835
The Captain told me that
you know this river upside down.

3
01:23:57,538 --> 01:24:02,078
My friend is lost.

4
01:24:03,001 --> 01:24:09,051
He is lost? In the jungle?
Forget it.

5
01:24:09,174 --> 01:24:10,764
He is dead.

6
01:24:10,843 --> 01:24:14,643
Your friend is already gone.

7
01:24:14,805 --> 01:24:22,195
My friend is alive and I need your help.

8
01:24:25,524 --> 01:24:27,034
I can't help you.

9
01:24:27,609 --> 01:24:34,159
I never begged to no one.
But I'm begging you.

10
01:24:34,241 --> 01:24:35,371
Please.

11
01:24:44,710 --> 01:24:47,250
How much for the boat?

12
01:40:59,601 --> 01:41:02,561
- What's wrong?
- We have to go back.

13
01:41:02,646 --> 01:41:04,556
Its impossible.

14
01:41:12,364 --> 01:41:14,954
You did everything
that was in your power.

15
01:46:12,456 --> 01:46:13,536
Thank you.

16
01:46:57,376 --> 01:47:02,756
I'm glad that God helped
you to comeback to us.
