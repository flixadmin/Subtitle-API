2
00:02:17,653 --> 00:02:19,112
I want a car.

3
00:02:21,365 --> 00:02:23,108
Chicks dig the car.

4
00:02:23,326 --> 00:02:26,078
This is why Superman works alone.

5
00:02:34,256 --> 00:02:38,040
Do try and bring this one
back in one piece, sir!

6
00:03:07,962 --> 00:03:09,242
Don't wait up, Al.

7
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:11,461
I'll cancel the pizzas.

8
00:03:27,402 --> 00:03:28,861
Batman,

9
00:03:29,029 --> 00:03:31,271
a new villain has commandeered
the Gotham Museum.

10
00:03:31,448 --> 00:03:33,322
He's frozen
the antiquities wing.

11
00:03:33,576 --> 00:03:35,984
He's turned
the security guards into ice.

12
00:03:36,204 --> 00:03:38,446
He's calling himself, "Mr. Freeze. "

13
00:03:38,707 --> 00:03:40,498
Mr. Freeze.

14
00:04:03,778 --> 00:04:06,351
Stop! Drop your weapon. . .

15
00:04:06,573 --> 00:04:07,853
. . .or we'll shoot!

16
00:04:21,424 --> 00:04:23,333
The lceman Cometh.

17
00:04:24,845 --> 00:04:27,087
Please, show some mercy.

18
00:04:27,515 --> 00:04:28,629
Mercy?!

19
00:04:30,852 --> 00:04:35,561
I'm afraid that my condition has
left me cold to your pleas of mercy.

20
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:55,456
In this universe. . .

21
00:04:55,673 --> 00:04:58,129
. . .there's only one absolute.

22
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,215
Everything. . .

23
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:03,210
. . .freezes.

24
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:09,929
Hi, Freeze.

25
00:05:10,148 --> 00:05:11,393
I'm Batman.

26
00:05:30,673 --> 00:05:32,749
You're not sending me to the cooler.

27
00:05:50,655 --> 00:05:51,604
Nice catch.

28
00:05:51,865 --> 00:05:53,240
You break it, you buy it.

29
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,775
Grab the gem!
Kill the heroes!

30
00:06:10,261 --> 00:06:12,052
Kill them! Kill them!

31
00:06:13,098 --> 00:06:15,090
Destroy everything!

32
00:06:25,988 --> 00:06:27,612
It's the hockey team from hell.

33
00:07:02,365 --> 00:07:03,396
Get the ice. . .

34
00:07:03,575 --> 00:07:05,117
. . .I'll get the lceman.

35
00:07:31,316 --> 00:07:32,395
Thanks.

36
00:07:48,586 --> 00:07:49,784
Sweet.

37
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,174
I got mine.

38
00:07:55,886 --> 00:07:57,261
Where's yours?

39
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,598
What killed the dinosaurs?

40
00:08:01,226 --> 00:08:03,100
The lce Age!

41
00:08:55,332 --> 00:08:56,530
Hit me, boys.

42
00:08:59,504 --> 00:09:01,295
Thanks for playing.

43
00:09:27,912 --> 00:09:29,988
I was hoping you'd drop in.

44
00:10:28,108 --> 00:10:29,306
Watch the numbers. . .

45
00:10:29,485 --> 00:10:31,976
. . .for they are
the harbingers of your doom.

46
00:10:32,155 --> 00:10:33,186
Can you feel it coming?

47
00:10:33,406 --> 00:10:36,277
The icy cold of space.

48
00:10:37,912 --> 00:10:41,661
At 30,000 feet,
your heart will freeze. . .

49
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:44,075
. . .and beat no more.

50
00:10:53,555 --> 00:10:57,423
After you're frozen, your icy tomb
will plummet back to Gotham.

51
00:10:57,643 --> 00:10:59,102
Freeze, you're mad.

52
00:10:59,938 --> 00:11:02,061
This capsule explodes,
it'll slaughter thousands.

53
00:11:02,316 --> 00:11:03,395
Freeze well.

54
00:11:27,012 --> 00:11:29,384
-Who invited you?
-I was hanging around.

55
00:11:29,598 --> 00:11:32,385
I thought you'd stay in the museum,
round up some thugs.

56
00:11:32,602 --> 00:11:35,307
How about, "Nice to see you.
Thanks for saving my life. "

57
00:11:48,537 --> 00:11:49,319
A Batbomb?

58
00:11:49,538 --> 00:11:52,290
We must blow this up
before it turns Gotham into a crater.

59
00:11:54,544 --> 00:11:55,658
Now what, call a taxi?!

60
00:11:56,797 --> 00:11:57,828
Watch the first step!

61
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:00,081
Surf's up!

62
00:12:34,967 --> 00:12:36,426
Gotcha!

63
00:12:42,434 --> 00:12:43,928
Cowabunga!

64
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:04,866
He's freezing the furnace!

65
00:13:45,426 --> 00:13:46,588
I got him.

66
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:54,805
Stay cool. . .

67
00:13:54,979 --> 00:13:56,438
. . .Birdboy.

68
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,949
Can you be cold?
You have 1 1 minutes to thaw the bird.

69
00:14:10,121 --> 00:14:12,327
Will you chase the villain. . .

70
00:14:12,499 --> 00:14:13,448
. . .or save him?

71
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:15,990
Emotion makes you weak.

72
00:14:16,546 --> 00:14:18,622
That's why this day is mine.

73
00:14:20,175 --> 00:14:22,084
I'll kill you next time!

74
00:15:07,022 --> 00:15:08,136
Did we get him?

75
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,071
Drats!

76
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:28,162
My experiment to mate the orchid and
the rattlesnake has failed again. . .

77
00:15:28,881 --> 00:15:33,424
. . .but I still have hope for
the animal-plant crossbreedings.

78
00:15:35,181 --> 00:15:37,470
If I can only find
the right dose of venom. . .

79
00:15:37,725 --> 00:15:41,141
. . .these plants will be able to
fight back, like animals.

80
00:15:41,897 --> 00:15:43,688
I will have given flora. . .

81
00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:48,442
. . .a chance against
the thoughtless ravages of man.

82
00:15:51,658 --> 00:15:53,069
Personal note:

83
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,618
My work would proceed faster. . .

84
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:59,329
. . .if Dr. Woodrue didn't whisk
my venom samples. . .

85
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:02,371
. . .back to his mysterious
Gilgamesh Wing.

86
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:05,211
Why won't he let me in the lab?

87
00:16:07,385 --> 00:16:09,508
What is he doing in there?

88
00:16:26,867 --> 00:16:31,328
Ladies and gentlemen
of the un-United Nations. . .

89
00:16:31,497 --> 00:16:32,872
. . .and. . .

90
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:36,120
. . .our mystery bidder. . .

91
00:16:36,503 --> 00:16:38,211

. . .volunteer.

97
00:16:51,062 --> 00:16:52,971
And what a charmer he is.

98
00:16:54,066 --> 00:16:58,645
By merely drilling three
concentric holes directly. . .

99
00:16:58,988 --> 00:17:02,689
. . .into Antonio's cranial cavity. . .
I have. . .

100
00:17:02,909 --> 00:17:06,907
. . .created viaducts into
the most primitive part of his brain. . .

101
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,746
. . .the limbic system.

102
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:14,127
And now I add. . .

103
00:17:14,298 --> 00:17:16,290
. . .my Super-Soldier Serum. . .

104
00:17:17,009 --> 00:17:18,088
. . .code-named. . .

105
00:17:18,678 --> 00:17:19,673
. . . "Venom" . . .

106
00:17:19,846 --> 00:17:23,049
. . .to which I add
my very own recipe of steroids. . .

107
00:17:23,267 --> 00:17:24,927
. . .and toxins.

108
00:17:26,771 --> 00:17:28,265
Plug him in.

109
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:29,940
Time to scream.

110
00:18:03,648 --> 00:18:05,107
Genius!

111
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,479
Behold. . .

112
00:18:06,735 --> 00:18:09,356
. . .the ideal killing machine!

113
00:18:09,613 --> 00:18:11,736
I call this little number. . .

114
00:18:12,242 --> 00:18:13,356
. . . "Bane. "

115
00:18:13,827 --> 00:18:15,903
Bane of Humanity!

116
00:18:16,914 --> 00:18:17,993
Imagine it.

117
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:22,450
Your own private army made up of
thousands of these super-soldiers.

118
00:18:23,255 --> 00:18:25,046
Bidding begins at a mere. . .

119
00:18:25,257 --> 00:18:26,668
. . . 1 0 million!

120
00:18:26,926 --> 00:18:27,839
Turbo!

121
00:18:28,469 --> 00:18:30,093
Show off for Daddy.

122
00:19:11,937 --> 00:19:13,265
Dr. Isley.

123
00:19:15,692 --> 00:19:17,898
Welcome to my parlor.

124
00:19:19,196 --> 00:19:20,227
What?

125
00:19:20,906 --> 00:19:21,901
You monster!

126
00:19:22,283 --> 00:19:23,694
How could you?!

127
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:27,244
Our original sponsor had
no stomach for military applications.

128
00:19:27,414 --> 00:19:29,537
He cut the funding for our work.

129
00:19:30,084 --> 00:19:31,626
Without your research. . .

130
00:19:31,878 --> 00:19:33,372
. . .I couldn't have come this far.

131
00:19:33,546 --> 00:19:34,459
Join me.

132
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:37,923
The two of us,
entwined, side by side.

133
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:38,923
Join you?

134
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:44,181
I have spent my life trying to
protect plants from extinction. . .

135
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:45,720
. . .and now you. . .

136
00:19:45,936 --> 00:19:48,261
. . .corrupt my research. . .

137
00:19:48,564 --> 00:19:52,099
. . .into some maniacal scheme for
world domination.

138
00:19:53,445 --> 00:19:55,853
When I get through. . .

139
00:19:56,073 --> 00:20:00,735
. . .you won't be able to get a job
teaching high school chemistry.

140
00:20:00,954 --> 00:20:02,365
Do you hear me?!

141
00:20:02,539 --> 00:20:04,745
You psycho!

142
00:20:07,086 --> 00:20:08,248
Well. . .

143
00:20:08,463 --> 00:20:10,420
. . .I can respect your opinion.

144
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:13,295
Sadly, I'm not good at rejection.

145
00:20:13,469 --> 00:20:15,592
I'm afraid you'll have to die.

146
00:20:41,335 --> 00:20:45,167
Let the poisons and toxins
burn a grave for you. . .

147
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:48,009
. . .deep into the earth
you love so much!

148
00:20:48,176 --> 00:20:49,800
Bye-bye, dear!

149
00:20:50,346 --> 00:20:51,721
Fellow maniacs. . .

150
00:20:51,972 --> 00:20:53,549
. . .bidding. . .

151
00:20:53,766 --> 00:20:55,474
. . .begins!

152
00:21:02,026 --> 00:21:05,976
Gotham University Labs
security video, 2 years ago.

153
00:21:07,616 --> 00:21:09,110
Dr. Victor Fries. . .

154
00:21:09,326 --> 00:21:13,620
. . .2-time Olympic decathlete and Nobel
Prize winner for molecular biology.

155
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,365
After his wife
contracted a rare disease. . .

156
00:21:16,543 --> 00:21:17,823
. . .Macgregor's Syndrome. . .

157
00:21:18,045 --> 00:21:21,212
. . .he hoped to freeze her in a cryogenic
sleep until he could find a cure.

158
00:21:21,382 --> 00:21:24,051
Now, here's where
everything goes north.

159
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,222
That's got to hurt.

160
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,809
That liquid is 50 below.

161
00:21:35,023 --> 00:21:37,062
But, he survived somehow.

162
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:40,351
The cryo-solution mutated his body.

163
00:21:45,244 --> 00:21:47,700
-What happened to his wife?
-No one knows.

164
00:21:47,872 --> 00:21:49,366
She's presumed dead.

165
00:21:49,582 --> 00:21:51,539
Freeze needs
extreme cold to survive.

166
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:56,668
His cryo-suit uses diamond-enhanced
lasers to keep him at zero degrees.

167
00:21:58,051 --> 00:22:01,052
If it's ice the lceman wants. . . .

168
00:22:11,692 --> 00:22:12,806
Coming, sir.

169
00:22:14,445 --> 00:22:15,690
Yes, sir?

170
00:22:16,072 --> 00:22:17,649
We need the Wayne diamonds.

171
00:22:17,908 --> 00:22:19,616
We going to trap a snowman?

172
00:22:20,577 --> 00:22:24,445
Yes, right after you spend
1 0 hours in the simulator, training.

173
00:22:24,624 --> 00:22:28,040
I made a mistake. I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

174
00:22:28,253 --> 00:22:30,292
You were reckless
and almost got killed.

175
00:22:30,464 --> 00:22:32,753
I'm fine! See!
Me, here, alive!

176
00:22:33,134 --> 00:22:36,088
How we supposed to work together
if you won't trust me?

177
00:22:39,266 --> 00:22:41,093
How indeed?

178
00:22:41,602 --> 00:22:43,760
He's overeager, he's impulsive.

179
00:22:43,938 --> 00:22:46,263
I can't trust him not to get hurt.

180
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:50,435
Perhaps the truth is
you really don't trust anyone.

181
00:22:50,905 --> 00:22:53,906
Don't tell me
you're on his side again.

182
00:22:54,618 --> 00:22:56,943
Despite all your talents. . .

183
00:22:57,162 --> 00:23:00,329
. . .you're still just
a novice in the ways of family.

184
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,330
Master Dick. . .

185
00:23:01,668 --> 00:23:03,957
. . .follows the same star as you. . .

186
00:23:04,338 --> 00:23:07,173
. . .but gets there by his own course.

187
00:23:07,925 --> 00:23:11,508
You must learn to trust him,
for that is the nature of family.

188
00:23:12,514 --> 00:23:14,341
I trust you, Alfred.

189
00:23:15,476 --> 00:23:17,801
But I shan't be here forever.

190
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:23,143
Good night, Master Bruce.

191
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:26,774
Good night, Alfred.

192
00:23:47,389 --> 00:23:49,381
Oh, dear, Master Bruce.

193
00:23:49,558 --> 00:23:51,966
Good gracious, what a tumble.

194
00:23:52,228 --> 00:23:54,351
There's a brave boy.

195
00:24:03,574 --> 00:24:04,238
Yes, sir.

196
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:08,407
I am so pleased you won the bidding,
Your Supreme Ruthlessness.

197
00:24:08,705 --> 00:24:11,789
We're making the final modifications
on Bane right now.

198
00:24:12,001 --> 00:24:16,829
We'll have a flawless super-soldier
out to you tomorrow by overnight mail.

199
00:24:37,907 --> 00:24:39,781
Dr. Isley?

200
00:24:40,743 --> 00:24:42,403
Pamela?

201
00:24:43,747 --> 00:24:45,075
You look great.

202
00:24:45,749 --> 00:24:47,825
Especially for a dead woman.

203
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,794
Hello, Jason.

204
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:54,795
I think I've had a change of heart.

205
00:24:55,094 --> 00:24:56,292
Or quite. . .

206
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:57,798
. . .Iiterally. . .

207
00:24:58,973 --> 00:25:02,923
. . .the animal-plant toxins had
a rather unique effect on me.

208
00:25:03,103 --> 00:25:05,772
They replaced my blood with aloe. . .

209
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:09,024
. . .my skin with chlorophyll. . .

210
00:25:09,277 --> 00:25:10,819
. . .and filled. . .

211
00:25:11,071 --> 00:25:12,814
. . .my lips. . .

212
00:25:24,128 --> 00:25:25,408
. . .with venom.

213
00:25:28,967 --> 00:25:30,924
And, Jason, one other thing.

214
00:25:31,846 --> 00:25:35,464
I probably
should have mentioned this earlier. . .

215
00:25:36,476 --> 00:25:37,507
. . .I'm. . .

216
00:25:38,478 --> 00:25:39,758
. . .poison.

217
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:48,273
It's a jungle in here.

218
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,443
I am Nature's arm. . .

219
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:53,994
. . .her spirit. . .

220
00:25:54,915 --> 00:25:55,697
. . .her will!

221
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,408
Hell, I am Mother Nature.

222
00:25:59,629 --> 00:26:01,586
And the time has come. . .

223
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:03,666
. . .for plants to take back. . .

224
00:26:03,884 --> 00:26:06,671
. . .the world so rightfully ours. . .

225
00:26:06,887 --> 00:26:08,381
. . .because it's not nice. . .

226
00:26:09,724 --> 00:26:12,297
. . .to fool with Mother Nature.

227
00:26:18,401 --> 00:26:20,559
"Wayne Enterprises. "

228
00:26:25,034 --> 00:26:26,943
Coming, Bane, darling.

229
00:26:27,495 --> 00:26:29,203
We've got a plane to catch.

230
00:26:45,057 --> 00:26:47,678
I'm Mr. Icicle

231
00:26:47,977 --> 00:26:49,804
I'm Mr. Ten Belo w

232
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,439
Sing! Sing!

233
00:26:57,238 --> 00:26:58,981
Come on, sing!

234
00:27:00,242 --> 00:27:01,570
Louder! Come on!

235
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,660
Sing! Sing! Sing!

236
00:27:03,871 --> 00:27:05,614
He's Mr. White Christmas

237
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:07,362
Louder!

238
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:10,711
He's Mr. Icicle

239
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:13,172
Freezy. . .

240
00:27:13,633 --> 00:27:15,424
. . .I'm feeling hot.

241
00:27:15,635 --> 00:27:17,544
I find that unlikely.

242
00:27:18,263 --> 00:27:21,762
So my hair is
brittle and my skin is dry. . .

243
00:27:21,976 --> 00:27:24,134
. . .I'd weather blizzards to have you.

244
00:27:24,396 --> 00:27:26,934
You're the most perfect man
I've ever known.

245
00:27:27,107 --> 00:27:29,230
Let's heat things up.

246
00:27:29,485 --> 00:27:31,976
My passion thaws
for my bride alone.

247
00:27:33,823 --> 00:27:36,112
Talk about your cold shoulder.

248
00:27:41,916 --> 00:27:42,615
Frosty!

249
00:27:42,834 --> 00:27:44,032
Yeah, boss?

250
00:27:45,129 --> 00:27:46,409
Energy.

251
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:50,163
Battling the Bat
exhausted my power.

252
00:27:55,015 --> 00:27:56,046
But. . .

253
00:27:57,226 --> 00:27:59,598
. . .I was successful nevertheless.

254
00:28:00,772 --> 00:28:02,100
Absolutely, boss.

255
00:28:02,316 --> 00:28:04,889
One more giant diamond of this size. . .

256
00:28:05,069 --> 00:28:08,070
. . .and my freezing engine
will be complete.

257
00:28:11,243 --> 00:28:12,702
I will freeze the city.

258
00:28:13,245 --> 00:28:15,997
Then I will hold Gotham ransom.

259
00:28:16,165 --> 00:28:18,573
Unless the city bows
to my demands. . .

260
00:28:18,793 --> 00:28:20,536
. . .it's winter forever
in Gotham.

261
00:28:21,171 --> 00:28:23,579
The city fathers
will have no choice. . .

262
00:28:23,799 --> 00:28:27,714
. . .but to give me the billions
I need to complete my research. . .

263
00:28:29,973 --> 00:28:32,049
. . .so I can find a cure.

264
00:28:33,352 --> 00:28:34,763
Leave us.

265
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:36,093
Sure, boss.

266
00:28:38,191 --> 00:28:40,349
We need quality time.

267
00:28:56,922 --> 00:28:59,840
Soon we will be together
once more.

268
00:29:00,843 --> 00:29:02,385
Soon.

269
00:29:25,414 --> 00:29:26,528
I'll get it.

270
00:29:36,886 --> 00:29:39,638
I must've dozed off.
My sincerest apologies.

271
00:29:39,889 --> 00:29:41,431
No apology necessary.

272
00:29:41,683 --> 00:29:44,435
It's the first time it's happened
in thirty years.

273
00:29:57,452 --> 00:29:59,160
Please be looking for me.

274
00:29:59,454 --> 00:30:02,325
Actually, I'm looking for
Alfred Pennyworth.

275
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,422
Uncle Alfred!

276
00:30:08,674 --> 00:30:10,002
My dear.

277
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:11,966
Oh, my dear. . .

278
00:30:12,178 --> 00:30:14,634
. . .what a most wonderful surprise.

279
00:30:14,848 --> 00:30:17,802
How did you manage
to come here all the way from England?

280
00:30:18,018 --> 00:30:20,805
My dear, you are so kind
to your old uncle.

281
00:30:21,397 --> 00:30:22,392
Uncle?

282
00:30:25,735 --> 00:30:29,187
Barbara is the daughter
of my dear sister Margaret.

283
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:33,156
Both my parents were killed
in a car accident 5 years ago.

284
00:30:33,328 --> 00:30:35,700
Uncle Alfred's been supporting me
ever since.

285
00:30:35,914 --> 00:30:37,657
-You have?
-Secrets, Al?

286
00:30:37,875 --> 00:30:42,003
Secrets are a virtual prerequisite
in this house.

287
00:30:42,213 --> 00:30:43,873
Don't you think, sir?

288
00:30:44,341 --> 00:30:45,290
I'm on break from--

289
00:30:45,509 --> 00:30:48,545
Oxbridge Academy,
Alfred's alma mater.

290
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:51,723
The new computer sciences division.

291
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:54,887
-How'd you know?
-Says so on the patch on your sweater.

292
00:31:00,109 --> 00:31:03,525
-What is it? It's beautiful.
-You can say that again.

293
00:31:04,114 --> 00:31:06,866
It's a competition racer.
I've been fixing it up.

294
00:31:07,076 --> 00:31:08,356
I'll show you how to ride it.

295
00:31:08,578 --> 00:31:10,369
You certainly will not!

296
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:14,198
Don't worry, Uncle Alfred.
I'm terrified of these things.

297
00:31:14,376 --> 00:31:16,582
Barbara, I hope you'll stay with us.

298
00:31:17,255 --> 00:31:18,749
Oh, I don't know.

299
00:31:18,965 --> 00:31:22,132
All this luxury really isn't
my style, but. . .

300
00:31:22,928 --> 00:31:24,126
. . .yeah, I'd love to.

301
00:31:24,764 --> 00:31:26,092
Then it's settled.

302
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:28,757
But, sir, we. . .

303
00:31:29,102 --> 00:31:31,260
. . .we do get so busy here.

304
00:31:31,438 --> 00:31:32,552
Don't be silly.

305
00:31:32,815 --> 00:31:34,392
After all, she's family.

306
00:31:51,837 --> 00:31:52,832
Uncle Alfred?

307
00:31:55,008 --> 00:31:56,799
I came to tuck you in.

308
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:59,299
You came to tuck me in?

309
00:31:59,597 --> 00:32:01,305
That's quite a switch.

310
00:32:02,642 --> 00:32:04,101
What're you working on?

311
00:32:04,311 --> 00:32:07,810
I'm trying to find my brother,
your Uncle Wilfred.

312
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:11,939
He's first butler
to the Maharajah of Miranjapore.

313
00:32:12,153 --> 00:32:15,107
But Miranjapore is a floating court.

314
00:32:15,324 --> 00:32:17,115
It travels through lndia.

315
00:32:17,326 --> 00:32:19,153
I remember Mom getting postcards.

316
00:32:19,328 --> 00:32:22,495
So Wilfred can be
rather difficult to find.

317
00:32:23,834 --> 00:32:27,037
I don't suppose they have
fax machines on elephants.

318
00:32:28,881 --> 00:32:31,337
I've been trying to reach him
with no success.

319
00:32:32,219 --> 00:32:35,173
When one grows ancient,
one yearns for family.

320
00:32:37,517 --> 00:32:40,352
I have the same picture of Mom
by my bed.

321
00:32:40,687 --> 00:32:41,636
Peg?

322
00:32:41,897 --> 00:32:44,470
My nickname for sweet Margaret.

323
00:32:47,236 --> 00:32:49,359
It's good to see you again.

324
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,354
I've missed you.

325
00:32:52,493 --> 00:32:54,367
As I have you.

326
00:32:55,705 --> 00:32:57,199
Sleep well, child.

327
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,042
You sleep.

328
00:33:02,129 --> 00:33:03,872
Go to bed.

329
00:34:08,958 --> 00:34:10,286
Good morning, Gotham.

330
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:15,253
It's Gossip Gerty reporting to you
direct from the Gotham Observatory...

331
00:34:15,466 --> 00:34:19,962
... where billionaire Bruce Wayne,
chairman of Wayne Enterprises...

332
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:25,138
...is about to make yet another
legendary contribution to the city.

333
00:34:26,312 --> 00:34:28,803
Gotham Observatory, Bane.

334
00:34:29,357 --> 00:34:31,017
And step on it.

335
00:34:32,027 --> 00:34:33,355
Step.

336
00:34:42,164 --> 00:34:46,826
My father told me, "To succeed,
we need only pick a star and follow it. "

337
00:34:47,671 --> 00:34:51,799
So Wayne Enterprises is donating
the world's most advanced telescope...

338
00:34:52,051 --> 00:34:55,171
... to Gotham 's
Observatory Restoration Project.

339
00:34:55,388 --> 00:34:56,633
With any luck...

340
00:34:56,932 --> 00:34:59,767
. . .this telescope will give
future generations a chance. . .

341
00:35:00,019 --> 00:35:02,011
. . .to follow their own stars.

342
00:35:04,399 --> 00:35:05,394
Brucy. . .

343
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:09,600
. . .is it true that this new telescope
can see around the globe?

344
00:35:09,822 --> 00:35:12,527
Yes. If you'll watch
these monitors right here.

345
00:35:13,535 --> 00:35:18,244
Satellites in orbit allow us to reflect
light from anywhere on the planet.

346
00:35:18,707 --> 00:35:22,041
From here, we'll be able
to see the sky anywhere on Earth. . .

347
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:25,005
. . .and through this
intricate network of satellites. . .

348
00:35:25,215 --> 00:35:29,545
. . .reflect it back to our
very own Gotham City for observation.

349
00:35:30,388 --> 00:35:32,096
Just don't point it at my bedroom.

350
00:35:37,271 --> 00:35:40,058
Brucy, you and the exquisite
Julie Madison. . .

351
00:35:40,275 --> 00:35:41,817
. . .have been going out forever.

352
00:35:42,068 --> 00:35:44,226
Are you going to tie the knot?

353
00:35:44,446 --> 00:35:45,228
Marriage?

354
00:35:45,447 --> 00:35:47,404
Marriage?

355
00:35:47,575 --> 00:35:49,864
You want to give me a hand here?

356
00:35:50,412 --> 00:35:52,570
Bruce and I are recklessly in love.

357
00:35:52,748 --> 00:35:56,449
And that's most certainly
enough for us. . .for now.

358
00:35:57,921 --> 00:36:00,875
If you will follow me,
I'll show you the central control grid.

359
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,924
You're a lot of help.

360
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,095
Miss, you need to stop.

361
00:36:06,306 --> 00:36:07,551
Move, fascist bulldog!

362
00:36:07,724 --> 00:36:09,930
-You need an appointment--
-No, I don't!

363
00:36:10,143 --> 00:36:13,061
Miss, you're not authorized
to be up here.

364
00:36:13,272 --> 00:36:14,434
She has no pass, sir.

365
00:36:14,607 --> 00:36:17,394
Little overly protective,
but you won't hurt me, Miss--?

366
00:36:17,611 --> 00:36:19,235
Dr. Pamela lsley.

367
00:36:19,446 --> 00:36:20,608
Doctor. . .

368
00:36:20,948 --> 00:36:22,323
. . .what can I do for you?

369
00:36:22,783 --> 00:36:24,906
Actually, I already
work for you, or did.

370
00:36:25,161 --> 00:36:27,782
Your arboreal preservation project
in South America.

371
00:36:28,498 --> 00:36:31,618
We cut our funding.
There was a conflict of ideologies.

372
00:36:31,794 --> 00:36:33,418
Dr. Woodrue was a lunatic.

373
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:34,744
I see you knew him.

374
00:36:35,006 --> 00:36:37,960
Yes. That lab burnt down last week.
I'm glad you escaped.

375
00:36:39,303 --> 00:36:43,467
I have here a proposal showing
how Wayne Enterprises can immediately. . .

376
00:36:43,641 --> 00:36:46,642
. . .cease all actions
that toxify our environment.

377
00:36:46,812 --> 00:36:49,137
Forget the stars,
look here at the earth. . .

378
00:36:49,356 --> 00:36:50,898
. . .our mother, our womb.

379
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:54,186
She deserves your loyalty
and protection.

380
00:36:55,155 --> 00:36:56,982
And yet, you spoil her lands. . .

381
00:36:57,658 --> 00:36:58,772
. . .poison her oceans. . .

382
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,191
. . .blacken her skies!

383
00:37:00,495 --> 00:37:01,657
You're killing her!

384
00:37:02,372 --> 00:37:06,287
Your intentions are noble,
but no diesel fuel for heat. . .

385
00:37:06,502 --> 00:37:11,330
. . .no coolants to preserve food,
millions of people would die.

386
00:37:11,549 --> 00:37:14,254
Acceptable losses
in the battle to save the planet.

387
00:37:15,137 --> 00:37:17,426
People come first, Dr. Isley.

388
00:37:19,517 --> 00:37:20,679
Mammals!

389
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,512
A day of reckoning is coming.

390
00:37:23,689 --> 00:37:24,803
That's right.

391
00:37:24,982 --> 00:37:27,687
The same plants and flowers
that saw you. . .

392
00:37:28,778 --> 00:37:30,770
. . .crawl from the primordial soup. . .

393
00:37:30,989 --> 00:37:35,283
. . .will reclaim this planet
and there will be no one to protect you!

394
00:37:39,374 --> 00:37:41,497
You must be new in town.

395
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:42,659
In Gotham City. . .

396
00:37:42,837 --> 00:37:45,162
. . .Batman and Robin protect us. . .

397
00:37:45,381 --> 00:37:48,002
. . .even from plants and flowers.

398
00:37:51,388 --> 00:37:53,215
Maybe you'd like to meet them.

399
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:56,258
Caped crusaders are
going to help us auction. . .

400
00:37:56,478 --> 00:37:59,016
. . .a diamond to raise money
for our botanical gardens.

401
00:37:59,732 --> 00:38:03,860
Just a few mammals doing what
we can for the world's plants.

402
00:38:04,237 --> 00:38:05,696
Thank you all for coming.

403
00:38:05,864 --> 00:38:07,144
Good day, Doctor.

404
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:18,743
Batman and Robin. . .

405
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:22,707
. . .militant arm
of the warm-blooded oppressors. . .

406
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:27,175
. . .animal protectors of the status quo.

407
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:29,724
First. . .

408
00:38:29,892 --> 00:38:33,593
. . .I'll rid myself of the fur
and feathered pests.

409
00:38:34,773 --> 00:38:36,849
And then Gotham. . .

410
00:38:37,067 --> 00:38:38,561
. . .will be mine. . .

411
00:38:38,778 --> 00:38:40,521
. . .for the greening.

412
00:39:01,847 --> 00:39:03,045
Excuse me, chief.

413
00:39:03,307 --> 00:39:05,928
I got something here
you might want to see.

414
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:15,565
I hate when people talk
during the movie.

415
00:39:34,969 --> 00:39:37,127
One more diamond, my love.

416
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:39,848
One more.

417
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:49,439
"Bruce Wayne. Diamonds. "

418
00:39:51,864 --> 00:39:53,144
Very nice.

419

close personal friend, Bruce Wayne.

00:41:05,952 --> 00:41:07,612
Think Freeze will take the bait?

427
00:41:07,996 --> 00:41:09,371
He'll be here.

428
00:41:10,165 --> 00:41:12,834
. . .to dance with one
of our fabulous flowers. . .

Hi, there.

438
00:43:54,986 --> 00:43:57,144
And you are?

439
00:43:57,572 --> 00:43:59,232
Poison. . .

440
00:43:59,449 --> 00:44:00,991
. . .Poison lvy.

441
00:44:11,589 --> 00:44:14,294
Why not send junior home early?

442
00:44:14,717 --> 00:44:18,003
I've got some wild oats to sow.

443
00:44:19,682 --> 00:44:21,473
On the other hand. . .

444
00:44:22,810 --> 00:44:25,597
. . .youth does have its advantages.

445
00:44:26,356 --> 00:44:28,894
Endurance, stamina.

446
00:44:29,527 --> 00:44:31,899
Forget the geriatric Bat.

447
00:44:32,196 --> 00:44:33,738
Come, join me.

448
00:44:33,948 --> 00:44:36,190
My garden needs tending.

449
00:44:36,702 --> 00:44:38,161
I'll take it from here, pal.

450
00:44:38,329 --> 00:44:40,487
Wouldn't you like the earrings too?

451
00:44:41,332 --> 00:44:45,662
Some lucky boy's
about to hit the honey pot.

452
00:44:45,963 --> 00:44:49,961
I'll include an evening of my company
for the winner.

453
00:44:50,718 --> 00:44:53,090
I'll bring everything you see here. . .

454
00:44:53,263 --> 00:44:56,632
. . .plus everything you don't.

455

-2 million.
-You don't have it. 3 million.

461
00:45:19,461 --> 00:45:20,920
I'll borrow it from you. Four.

462
00:45:22,214 --> 00:45:23,079
5 million.

463
00:45:23,257 --> 00:45:24,881
That's a utility belt, not a money belt.

464
00:45:25,092 --> 00:45:26,087
6 million.

465
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:27,173
7 million.

466
00:45:30,724 --> 00:45:32,183
Never leave the cave without it.

467
00:45:32,476 --> 00:45:35,928
You boys aren't going to start fighting
over little old me, now are you?

468
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:51,947
All right, everyone!
Chill.

469
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:54,116
Chill.

470
00:46:03,429 --> 00:46:04,378
Get the gun!

471
00:46:48,441 --> 00:46:50,065
Look at you!

472
00:46:50,277 --> 00:46:52,151
Let me guess.

473
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:54,025
Plant Girl?

474
00:46:54,407 --> 00:46:56,198
Vine Lady?

475
00:46:56,951 --> 00:46:59,193
Hand over the diamond, Garden Gal. . .

476
00:46:59,371 --> 00:47:01,198
. . .or I'll turn you into mulch.

477
00:47:06,212 --> 00:47:07,671
Pheromone dust. . .

. . .a man's blood.

480
00:47:11,969 --> 00:47:14,377
Doesn't work on the cold-hearted.
If you please!

481
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:17,429
If you insist.

482
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:23,436
Clever little clover.

483
00:47:27,529 --> 00:47:29,687
That's my exit cue.

484
00:47:30,157 --> 00:47:31,402
Thanks.

485
00:47:42,839 --> 00:47:43,918
Good night.

486
00:47:46,093 --> 00:47:47,717
Cool party!

487
00:48:15,252 --> 00:48:18,419
Commissioner, you have 1 1 minutes
to thaw these people.

488
00:48:24,972 --> 00:48:28,887
Miss lvy, you've just met
one of the most sinister men in Gotham.

489
00:48:29,311 --> 00:48:31,303
That's not a man. . .

490
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:33,472
. . .that is a god.

491
00:48:39,614 --> 00:48:41,523
Enough monkey business.

492
00:48:42,409 --> 00:48:44,615
We've got work to do.

493
00:48:45,496 --> 00:48:47,073
Monkey work.

494
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:39,225
You can't make the jump.

495
00:49:39,435 --> 00:49:40,549
I can!

496
00:49:43,315 --> 00:49:44,061
Pull back!

497
00:49:44,525 --> 00:49:45,556
I can make it!

498
00:49:45,776 --> 00:49:47,353
Redbird control codes.

499
00:49:50,365 --> 00:49:51,645
Disable engine.

500
00:49:53,577 --> 00:49:54,775
Don't do it to me! !

501
00:50:03,088 --> 00:50:04,333
We won't make it!

502
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,323
It's a cold town.

503
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:02,234
I could've made that jump.

504
00:51:02,533 --> 00:51:05,320
You could've splattered your brains
on the building's side.

505
00:51:05,495 --> 00:51:07,203
The Flying Graysons were a team.

506
00:51:07,456 --> 00:51:09,365
We had to trust each to do his job.

507
00:51:09,542 --> 00:51:11,581
That's what being partners is about.

508
00:51:11,794 --> 00:51:14,202
Counting on someone is the way to win.

509
00:51:14,422 --> 00:51:16,711
Your head wasn't on the job.
It was on Poison lvy.

510
00:51:17,301 --> 00:51:19,459
Maybe she wanted me instead of you.

511
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:21,422
That's your idea of friendship?

512
00:51:21,598 --> 00:51:24,267
It's your rules.
It's your way, or the highway.

513
00:51:24,476 --> 00:51:27,097
It's Batman and Robin,
not Robin and Batman.

514
00:51:27,313 --> 00:51:30,480
-I'm sick of it!
-Yes, it's my rules that keep us alive.

515
00:51:30,650 --> 00:51:34,019
If you want to stay in this house,
on this team, you'll abide by them.

516
00:51:35,197 --> 00:51:36,739
This is no partnership.

517
00:51:36,991 --> 00:51:38,485
You're never going to trust me!

518
00:51:45,334 --> 00:51:47,042
Dear brother Wilfred. . .

519
00:51:47,628 --> 00:51:51,496
. . .I have tried
every address I know for you.

520
00:51:51,675 --> 00:51:54,166
I'm just praying this reaches you.

521
00:51:55,012 --> 00:51:56,506
We have very little time.

522
00:52:13,075 --> 00:52:15,566
Batman monopolized the evening news.

523
00:52:17,831 --> 00:52:20,452
Congratulations on your
apprehension of Mr. Freeze.

524
00:52:20,626 --> 00:52:22,203
Thanks.
Thank you.

525
00:52:25,715 --> 00:52:27,375
Is there something wrong, sir?

526
00:52:30,554 --> 00:52:32,178
Am I pig-headed?

527
00:52:34,851 --> 00:52:36,393
Is it always. . .

528
00:52:36,561 --> 00:52:38,553
. . .my way or the highway?

529
00:52:39,023 --> 00:52:40,683
Why, yes.
Actually.

530
00:52:41,859 --> 00:52:45,608
Death and chance stole your parents. . .

531
00:52:45,864 --> 00:52:47,903
. . .but rather than become a victim. . .

532
00:52:48,158 --> 00:52:52,073
. . .you have done everything
in your power to control the fates.

533
00:52:52,706 --> 00:52:54,698
For what is Batman. . .

534
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,627
. . .if not an effort to master the chaos
that sweeps our world?

535
00:53:00,590 --> 00:53:02,464
An attempt to control. . .

536
00:53:02,634 --> 00:53:04,342
. . .death itself?

537
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:25,743
But I can't, can l?

538
00:53:27,538 --> 00:53:29,198
None of us can.

539
00:53:55,238 --> 00:53:57,527
Sorry. So sorry!

540
00:53:57,783 --> 00:53:59,194
Teach you that at Oxbridge?

541
00:53:59,410 --> 00:54:03,740
Just a few judo lessons.
You know, London's kind of rough.

542
00:54:04,082 --> 00:54:06,490
I suppose you had
a minor in motorbikes also?

543
00:54:08,879 --> 00:54:10,539
Couldn't resist.

544
00:54:10,715 --> 00:54:12,090
It's just so beautiful.

545
00:54:13,092 --> 00:54:15,879
I just took it out for a spin.
I'll clean it tomorrow.

546
00:54:16,263 --> 00:54:17,212
All right?

547
00:54:17,431 --> 00:54:18,593
Sorry.

548
00:54:19,266 --> 00:54:21,140
Sorry.
Good night.

549
00:55:06,572 --> 00:55:08,730
Drag him into the cold beam.

550
00:55:10,661 --> 00:55:12,535
Welcome home, Frost Face.

551
00:55:12,746 --> 00:55:15,747
You're the common cold,
and we are the cure.

552
00:55:18,044 --> 00:55:20,617
Allow me to break the ice.

553
00:55:20,881 --> 00:55:23,039
My name is Freeze.

554
00:55:23,342 --> 00:55:25,085
Learn it well. . .

555
00:55:25,345 --> 00:55:28,180
. . .for it's the chilling sound
of your doom.

556
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:44,531
All right, Freezie, you can't live
outside the cold zone.

557
00:55:55,839 --> 00:55:57,831
Look at him stew.

558
00:55:59,927 --> 00:56:01,338
Get used to it.

559
00:56:01,554 --> 00:56:04,425
You're going to be here a very long. . .

560
00:56:04,641 --> 00:56:06,384
. . .Iong time.

561
00:56:07,812 --> 00:56:09,354
Sadly. . .

562
00:56:09,564 --> 00:56:11,936
. . .you will not live to see it.

563
00:56:23,831 --> 00:56:27,414
Batface and Birdbrain turned out
to be much more resistant. . .

564
00:56:27,627 --> 00:56:29,952
. . .to my love dust
than expected.

565
00:56:30,171 --> 00:56:34,169
No matter. Next time
I'll just give them a stronger dose.

566
00:56:34,426 --> 00:56:37,462
They'll literally be dying for me.

567
00:56:38,473 --> 00:56:40,631
"Turkish baths. "

568
00:56:40,851 --> 00:56:42,760
This looks promising.

569
00:57:10,052 --> 00:57:11,926
A fixer-upper.

570
00:57:12,597 --> 00:57:14,673
But with a certain homey charm.

571
00:57:16,393 --> 00:57:17,673
A minus!

572
00:57:17,978 --> 00:57:19,721
Current tenants.

573
00:57:19,897 --> 00:57:22,851
Hello, my little pretty, pretty, pretty.

574
00:57:23,026 --> 00:57:24,817
Hello, yourself.

575
00:57:25,445 --> 00:57:27,022
You look good enough to eat.

576
00:57:27,698 --> 00:57:29,525
That I am.

577
00:57:30,034 --> 00:57:32,905
Come and get me,
if you can.

578
00:57:35,707 --> 00:57:37,367
With pleasure.

579
00:57:57,775 --> 00:57:59,352
Let's redecorate.

580
00:58:08,539 --> 00:58:11,789
I've always hankered
for something on the water.

581
00:58:20,261 --> 00:58:22,253
What is this floor?

582
00:58:29,564 --> 00:58:31,640
It took God seven days. . .

583
00:58:31,817 --> 00:58:33,975
. . .to create Paradise.

584
00:58:34,486 --> 00:58:37,191
Let's see if I can do better.

585
00:58:43,664 --> 00:58:45,656
Good babies.

586
00:58:46,125 --> 00:58:47,204
Grow for mommy.

587
00:58:53,217 --> 00:58:54,711
Bane, darling. . .

588
00:58:54,927 --> 00:58:58,296
. . .I found a fellow
who strikes my fancy.

589
00:58:58,515 --> 00:59:00,673
A cool customer, yes.

590
00:59:01,769 --> 00:59:03,678
Icy demeanor. . .

591
00:59:04,230 --> 00:59:05,772
. . .no question.

592
00:59:06,608 --> 00:59:10,309
But I detect a certain ruthless charm
I may be able to use. . .

593
00:59:10,529 --> 00:59:12,438
. . .to my advantage.

594
00:59:13,324 --> 00:59:15,897
Honey, clean up this mess.

595
00:59:16,077 --> 00:59:18,069
We've got company coming.

596
00:59:18,914 --> 00:59:19,863
Honey.

597
00:59:20,541 --> 00:59:21,703
Company.

598
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:38,552
We've been going out
for over a year now, and. . . .

599
00:59:39,897 --> 00:59:41,177
Okay, here it goes.

600
00:59:41,399 --> 00:59:43,724
I want to spend my life with you.

601
00:59:46,905 --> 00:59:48,732
I'm not the marrying kind.

602
00:59:48,908 --> 00:59:51,826
There are things about me
you wouldn't understand.

603
00:59:52,370 --> 00:59:55,122
I know you're a dedicated bachelor.

604
00:59:55,332 --> 00:59:56,826
You've had your wild nights.

605
00:59:57,501 --> 00:59:58,995
"Wild" doesn't. . .

606
00:59:59,837 --> 01:00:01,296
. . .quite cover it.

607
01:00:02,924 --> 01:00:05,380
You'll make someone
a good husband one day. . .

608
01:00:05,761 --> 01:00:07,136
. . .but I can't wait forever.

609
01:00:12,352 --> 01:00:15,104
Look, I don't want to pressure you.
Because if I do. . .

610
01:00:15,272 --> 01:00:17,311
. . .you'll just shut down.

611
01:00:17,775 --> 01:00:19,317
I know the way you are.

612
01:00:20,946 --> 01:00:22,689
Think about it.

613
01:00:22,948 --> 01:00:25,106
Just promise me you'll think about it.

614
01:00:26,035 --> 01:00:26,865
Okay?

615
01:00:28,413 --> 01:00:30,156
You don't have to answer now.

616
01:00:30,541 --> 01:00:31,620
Just. . .

617
01:00:31,792 --> 01:00:33,120
. . .think it over.

618
01:00:33,335 --> 01:00:35,162
Here's food for thought.

619
01:00:54,068 --> 01:00:55,266
Who's lvy?

620
01:00:57,614 --> 01:00:59,405
You just called me "Ivy. "

621
01:00:59,658 --> 01:01:00,986
Who's lvy?

622
01:01:02,203 --> 01:01:03,578
I wish I knew.

623
01:01:05,749 --> 01:01:08,157
Enhance detail, 1 4 to 1 9.

624
01:01:13,383 --> 01:01:15,091
Who are you?

625
01:01:29,026 --> 01:01:30,224
Gotcha!

626
01:02:18,251 --> 01:02:19,911
Banker, how much coin to play?

627
01:02:20,087 --> 01:02:21,201
2 1 /2.

628
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:24,298
You're the chick who won
the tunnel run 2 nights ago!

629
01:02:24,509 --> 01:02:25,540
That'd be me.

630
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:28,085
That was kid stuff, sweetheart.

631
01:02:28,347 --> 01:02:31,218
Why don't you take your tricycle
and run home?

632
01:02:32,268 --> 01:02:34,011
-Want a side bet?
-How much?

633
01:02:34,229 --> 01:02:35,937
-How much you got?
-How much you got?

634
01:02:36,106 --> 01:02:39,356
All right, let's race! Come on!

635
01:02:47,286 --> 01:02:50,620
Just make sure the guys are ready
at the end of the bridge.

636
01:02:51,791 --> 01:02:53,119
You got it, Spike!

637
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:04,374
Out of my way, losers!

638
01:04:05,670 --> 01:04:06,915
Nice try, girlie!

639
01:04:07,130 --> 01:04:08,375
You're next!

640
01:04:10,426 --> 01:04:11,885
Excuse me!

641
01:04:15,474 --> 01:04:16,968
Look out, baby!

642
01:04:35,956 --> 01:04:38,162
Not bad, for a chick!

643
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:12,489
Now!

644
01:05:26,975 --> 01:05:28,517
End of the line, sweetheart!

645
01:05:55,009 --> 01:05:56,586
So this is where you hang out.

646
01:06:01,183 --> 01:06:02,428
How long you been racing?

647
01:06:02,602 --> 01:06:04,641
Since my parents died.

648
01:06:04,812 --> 01:06:08,810
I guess all the speed and danger
helped take me out of myself.

649
01:06:09,026 --> 01:06:10,769
Made the pain go away.

650
01:06:11,362 --> 01:06:12,986
You wouldn't understand.

651
01:06:13,197 --> 01:06:14,656
You'd be surprised.

652
01:06:15,033 --> 01:06:19,660
Street racing isn't exactly
an acceptable major at Oxbridge so. . .

653
01:06:19,830 --> 01:06:21,324
. . .they kicked me out.

654
01:06:21,582 --> 01:06:25,247
But I've already won the money I need
to do what I've always dreamed.

655
01:06:25,462 --> 01:06:27,538
Don't say you want to join the circus.

656
01:06:28,549 --> 01:06:32,629
Alfred has supported me my whole life
and I'm going to pay him back.

657
01:06:33,513 --> 01:06:36,218
I'll take him away
from this dismal life of servitude.

658
01:06:37,017 --> 01:06:38,511
What are you talking about?

659
01:06:38,686 --> 01:06:41,473
Listen, this whole
master-servant thing. . .

660
01:06:41,648 --> 01:06:43,059
. . .it's really ridiculous.

661
01:06:43,275 --> 01:06:45,517
Alfred is a sweet, noble man. . .

662
01:06:45,694 --> 01:06:49,229
. . .and he's subjugated all his life
and dreams to someone else.

663
01:06:49,449 --> 01:06:51,406
Alfred and Bruce are like family.

664
01:06:52,536 --> 01:06:54,694
Paying someone to prepare your meals. . .

665
01:06:54,872 --> 01:06:57,790
. . .do laundry, clean dishes,
you call that family?

666
01:06:58,042 --> 01:06:59,417
Alfred's happy.

667
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:01,086
Happy?

668
01:07:01,755 --> 01:07:04,127
You honestly don't know, do you?

669
01:07:04,341 --> 01:07:06,832
How he's hiding the pain all the time.

670
01:07:07,595 --> 01:07:08,923
Alfred's sick.

671
01:07:12,518 --> 01:07:14,427
Alfred's not sick.

672
01:07:14,729 --> 01:07:16,104
He's dying.

673
01:07:18,817 --> 01:07:20,015
Dying?

674
01:07:23,406 --> 01:07:24,900
Why didn't he tell us?

675
01:07:25,450 --> 01:07:28,155
You know Alfred,
he'd never say anything.

676
01:07:34,419 --> 01:07:35,747
But I can tell.

677
01:07:40,718 --> 01:07:42,545
I can't believe it.

678
01:07:43,930 --> 01:07:44,925
I know.

679
01:08:33,655 --> 01:08:35,398
Icehead, you got a visitor.

680
01:08:35,950 --> 01:08:38,358
Your sister is here to see you.

681
01:08:38,536 --> 01:08:39,781
Sister?

682
01:08:43,918 --> 01:08:45,827
Brother, dear. . .

683
01:08:46,504 --> 01:08:48,710
. . .I heard you were blue.

684
01:08:51,009 --> 01:08:53,381
Don't mind us, ma'am.

685
01:08:53,554 --> 01:08:55,546
You can speak freely.

686
01:08:58,226 --> 01:09:00,717
I don't mind you at all.

687
01:09:04,692 --> 01:09:05,937
Men. . .

688
01:09:06,277 --> 01:09:09,029
. . .the most absurd of God's creatures.

689
01:09:09,239 --> 01:09:10,567
We give you life. . .

690
01:09:11,242 --> 01:09:14,658
. . .and we can take it away
just as easily.

691
01:09:14,829 --> 01:09:17,071
-Right!
-Whatever.

692
01:09:18,459 --> 01:09:20,997
I really am to die for.

693
01:09:48,870 --> 01:09:50,447
Impressive!

694
01:09:51,623 --> 01:09:54,873
Well, l, my most
unabominable snowman. . .

695
01:09:55,461 --> 01:09:57,833
. . .have been impressed by you.

696
01:09:58,047 --> 01:09:59,458
In fact. . .

697
01:09:59,632 --> 01:10:02,088
. . .I propose a pairing.

698
01:10:12,231 --> 01:10:14,307
I've come to set you free.

699
01:10:15,276 --> 01:10:17,103
An enticing offer. . .

700
01:10:17,779 --> 01:10:18,774
. . .but. . .

701
01:10:18,947 --> 01:10:21,105
. . .what does the lady want in return?

702
01:10:23,911 --> 01:10:27,327
Let's cool it for now.
I've got someone I want you to meet.

703
01:10:34,799 --> 01:10:37,088
His name is Bane.

704
01:10:37,677 --> 01:10:40,797
A laundry service that delivers! Wow!

705
01:10:45,812 --> 01:10:48,683
What are you,
about a 50, big and tall?

706
01:10:49,108 --> 01:10:52,976
No, I always go a size smaller.
Makes me look slimmer.

707
01:10:58,577 --> 01:11:00,071
I'm running on empty.

708
01:11:00,329 --> 01:11:01,823
I need the diamonds.

709
01:11:01,998 --> 01:11:04,156
I'll help you grab your rocks.

710
01:11:07,546 --> 01:11:08,625
Bane. . .

711
01:11:08,839 --> 01:11:10,084
. . .dear. . .

712
01:11:10,341 --> 01:11:11,883
. . .an exit, please.

713
01:11:17,725 --> 01:11:19,468
Reinforced steel.

714
01:11:19,685 --> 01:11:20,799
Not good.

715
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:34,025
Always winterize your pipes.

716
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:54,130
While I get my diamonds,
you and "meatloaf" retrieve my wife.

717
01:11:54,393 --> 01:11:56,432
You never mentioned a wife!

718
01:11:56,604 --> 01:11:57,599
Come on.

719
01:11:57,772 --> 01:11:59,681
I hope Mr. Bane can swim.

720
01:12:18,130 --> 01:12:20,122
Alfred, are you well?

721
01:12:20,466 --> 01:12:22,957
As well as can be expected, sir.

722
01:12:25,096 --> 01:12:26,638
My friend, I know you're sick.

723
01:12:26,848 --> 01:12:28,639
I can get you the best doctors.

724
01:12:28,851 --> 01:12:31,520
I have seen the best doctors.

725
01:12:31,979 --> 01:12:36,641
A gentleman does not discuss
his ailments. It is not civilized.

726
01:12:37,110 --> 01:12:41,322
I hope that I have taught you
at least that much, Master Bruce.

727
01:12:44,703 --> 01:12:46,114
Have you ever. . .

728
01:12:46,330 --> 01:12:48,821
. . .regretted your life working here?

729
01:12:49,667 --> 01:12:51,078
Looking after heroes?

730
01:12:51,294 --> 01:12:52,574
No, sir.

731
01:12:53,547 --> 01:12:57,675
My only regret is that I was never
able to be out there with you.

732
01:13:01,181 --> 01:13:03,589
Not all the heroes wear masks.

733
01:13:07,814 --> 01:13:09,059
Freeze has escaped!

734
01:13:22,873 --> 01:13:25,446
We got this off
the Arkham surveillance camera.

735
01:13:28,714 --> 01:13:30,042
Poison lvy.

736
01:13:31,718 --> 01:13:32,713
2 nights ago. . .

737
01:13:32,969 --> 01:13:36,967
. . .Gotham Airport, these two arrive
by charter from South America.

738
01:13:37,350 --> 01:13:40,304
They put 1 0 security guards
in the hospital. . .

739
01:13:40,562 --> 01:13:45,058
. . .Ieft a businessman dead from
organic poisoning, stole his limousine.

740
01:13:45,276 --> 01:13:48,562
This is definitely the same pair
that sprang Freeze.

741
01:13:49,781 --> 01:13:51,192
Excuse me, gentlemen.

742
01:13:52,117 --> 01:13:54,573
Poison lvy. . .
why would she help Freeze?

743
01:13:54,787 --> 01:13:56,329
She's definitely evil.

744
01:13:56,581 --> 01:13:59,333
She was all I could think about,
like I was in love--

745
01:13:59,584 --> 01:14:01,707
I know, then the feeling vanished.

746
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:04,209
I can't believe
we fought over a bad guy.

747
01:14:04,423 --> 01:14:06,748
Bad, yes. Guy, no.

748
01:14:06,968 --> 01:14:08,711
Well, I'm totally over her.

749
01:14:08,929 --> 01:14:10,637
Me too. Definitely.

750
01:14:11,598 --> 01:14:13,756
-Great stems, though.
-Buds too.

751
01:14:13,935 --> 01:14:14,930
Those are nice.

752
01:14:15,103 --> 01:14:16,217
Here we go.

753
01:14:22,403 --> 01:14:23,565
It's Nora Fries.

754
01:14:23,780 --> 01:14:25,108
She's still alive.

755
01:14:41,133 --> 01:14:43,968
He adapted his freezing technology
to reverse the disease.

756
01:14:44,137 --> 01:14:46,806
He found a cure for the disease
in some stages.

757
01:14:47,808 --> 01:14:48,803
There she is.

758
01:14:50,102 --> 01:14:52,427
Get the diamonds.
I'll rescue the bride.

759
01:14:52,689 --> 01:14:54,812
We'll meet back at my place.

760
01:14:55,651 --> 01:14:58,985
In my weakened condition,
I'm no match for the Bat and Bird.

761
01:14:59,155 --> 01:15:01,693
You leave those boys to me.

762
01:15:02,158 --> 01:15:03,153
Go!

763
01:15:05,704 --> 01:15:08,409
-Can he save her?
-Her case is too advanced.

764
01:15:08,666 --> 01:15:09,994
But maybe someday. . .

765
01:15:10,168 --> 01:15:11,828
. . .with more research. . . .

766
01:15:18,302 --> 01:15:19,677
Poison lvy.

767
01:15:29,816 --> 01:15:31,939
I hate uninvited guests.

768
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:40,737
My lungs are freezing!

769
01:15:53,678 --> 01:15:54,673
Chilled. . .

770
01:15:54,887 --> 01:15:56,049
. . .to perfection.

771
01:16:03,272 --> 01:16:04,267
No beauty.

772
01:16:07,235 --> 01:16:08,777
Just the beast.

773
01:16:28,761 --> 01:16:30,800
Hey, there, pretty birdie.

774
01:16:31,014 --> 01:16:32,923
Give yourself up. If you surrender--

775
01:16:33,141 --> 01:16:34,255
To you?

776
01:16:36,270 --> 01:16:38,262
Polly want a kiss?

777
01:16:50,620 --> 01:16:54,998
There's something about
an anatomically correct. . .

778
01:16:55,209 --> 01:16:59,289
. . .rubber suit
that puts fire in a girl's lips.

779
01:17:02,634 --> 01:17:06,133
Why are all the gorgeous ones
homicidal maniacs? ls it me?

780
01:17:06,305 --> 01:17:07,254
Enough. . .

781
01:17:07,432 --> 01:17:09,056
. . .sweet talk.

782
01:17:11,979 --> 01:17:15,313
First you'll tell me where Freeze is,
then you're going to jail.

783
01:17:19,613 --> 01:17:21,107
I'm a lover, not a fighter.

784
01:17:21,323 --> 01:17:24,657
That's why every Poison lvy
Action Figure comes with him!

785
01:17:28,165 --> 01:17:31,036
Try not to make a mess when you die.

786
01:18:02,038 --> 01:18:03,200
Hold it right there!

787
01:18:24,898 --> 01:18:26,226
Stop!

788
01:18:28,528 --> 01:18:32,193
Living in the shadow
of the big, bad Bat.

789
01:18:32,407 --> 01:18:34,281
You don't need him.

790
01:18:35,077 --> 01:18:37,200
You're the star.

791
01:18:37,413 --> 01:18:39,204
I can see it now:

792
01:18:39,416 --> 01:18:43,580
Your own big, bright signal in the sky.

793
01:18:44,422 --> 01:18:46,414
Let me guide you.

794
01:18:55,101 --> 01:18:56,928
Let me kiss you.

795
01:18:57,103 --> 01:18:58,597
Stop! Don't kiss her.

796
01:18:59,273 --> 01:19:02,108
The victim at the airport,
toxins introduced orally.

797
01:19:02,318 --> 01:19:04,939
-What are you saying?
-Why does she want to kiss us?

798
01:19:05,154 --> 01:19:07,526
-I bet her lips are poisoned.
-Poisoned kiss?

799
01:19:07,741 --> 01:19:09,116
You have issues with women!

800
01:19:09,326 --> 01:19:11,734
You can't stand that
she'd kiss me and not you.

801
01:19:11,996 --> 01:19:14,119
Something would be mine, not yours.

802
01:19:24,594 --> 01:19:25,673
Exit, Bane.

803
01:19:26,096 --> 01:19:27,590
Exit!

804
01:19:38,694 --> 01:19:41,150
Ivy's right. I don't need your help.

805
01:19:43,492 --> 01:19:45,152
I'm going solo!

806
01:19:47,788 --> 01:19:48,902
What happened?

807
01:19:49,123 --> 01:19:50,783
How'd they get away?

808
01:20:08,229 --> 01:20:11,183
I've never been good with competition.

809
01:20:13,235 --> 01:20:16,355
Who needs a frigid wife anyway?

810
01:20:41,393 --> 01:20:43,267
Make yourself right at home.

811
01:20:45,690 --> 01:20:46,888
Where's my wife?

812
01:20:47,359 --> 01:20:50,395
There was nothing I could do.
Batman deactivated her.

813
01:20:50,863 --> 01:20:53,069
-She's dead.
-You lie!

814
01:21:17,896 --> 01:21:19,473
I'm sorry.

815
01:21:21,734 --> 01:21:24,652
Their bones will turn to ice!

816
01:21:26,782 --> 01:21:29,487
Their blood will freeze in my hands!

817
01:21:30,327 --> 01:21:31,702
Kill them, of course.

818
01:21:31,913 --> 01:21:33,787
But why stop there?

819
01:21:34,457 --> 01:21:37,244
Why should only
Batman and Robin die. . .

820
01:21:37,461 --> 01:21:40,830
. . .while the society that created them
goes unpunished?

821
01:21:41,090 --> 01:21:42,750
Yes!

822
01:21:42,967 --> 01:21:45,125
If I must suffer. . .

823
01:21:45,345 --> 01:21:48,263
. . .humanity will suffer with me!

824
01:21:48,474 --> 01:21:53,350
I shall repay them for sentencing me
to a life without human comfort.

825
01:21:53,939 --> 01:21:57,355
I will blanket the city
in endless winter!

826
01:21:57,651 --> 01:21:58,813
First. . .

827
01:22:00,321 --> 01:22:01,519
. . .Gotham.

828
01:22:02,657 --> 01:22:04,199
And then. . .

829
01:22:04,660 --> 01:22:05,774
. . .the world!

830
01:22:06,203 --> 01:22:08,990
Just what I had in mind.

831
01:22:10,291 --> 01:22:13,458
Everything dead on Earth except us.

832
01:22:13,670 --> 01:22:15,164
A chance for. . .

833
01:22:15,381 --> 01:22:18,216
. . .Mother Nature to start again.

834
01:22:18,551 --> 01:22:19,464
Behold. . .

835
01:22:19,678 --> 01:22:22,383
. . .the dawn of a new age.

836
01:22:25,852 --> 01:22:29,019
My mutant plants have the strength
of the deadliest animals.

837
01:22:29,856 --> 01:22:34,234
Once you have frozen mankind,
these babies will overrun the globe.

838
01:22:35,238 --> 01:22:37,029
And we shall rule them.

839
01:22:38,700 --> 01:22:40,194
For we will be. . .

840
01:22:40,410 --> 01:22:42,983
. . .the only two people
left in the world.

841
01:22:43,831 --> 01:22:45,539
Yes.

842
01:22:45,875 --> 01:22:47,203
Adam. . .

843
01:22:48,712 --> 01:22:49,992
. . .and Evil.

844
01:22:51,716 --> 01:22:53,673
You distract the Bat and Bird. . .

845
01:22:53,843 --> 01:22:55,385
. . .while I prepare. . .

846
01:22:55,595 --> 01:22:56,923
. . .to freeze. . .

847
01:22:57,180 --> 01:22:58,591
. . .Gotham!

848
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:15,368
It's Stage 1 of Macgregor's Syndrome.

849
01:23:15,914 --> 01:23:17,028
I'm sorry.

850
01:23:18,168 --> 01:23:21,004
All we can do is
make him comfortable.

851
01:23:23,551 --> 01:23:24,879
Thank you, Doctor.

852
01:23:42,205 --> 01:23:44,778
Macgregor's Syndrome is
what Fries' wife had.

853
01:23:45,335 --> 01:23:47,956
Alfred's condition is less severe.
Fries' research said. . .

854
01:23:48,214 --> 01:23:50,622
. . .he cured a case like it,
just didn't say how.

855
01:23:50,844 --> 01:23:52,718
No one else is even close.

856
01:23:52,929 --> 01:23:56,548
I'm late for the dedication,
then I go after Freeze and lvy alone.

857
01:23:56,769 --> 01:23:59,011
-Like hell you do.
-Don't push me right now.

858
01:23:59,231 --> 01:24:02,482
Or what? No one can
capture lvy but the big, bad Bat?

859
01:24:02,695 --> 01:24:03,441
Right.

860
01:24:03,989 --> 01:24:05,483
You want her for yourself.

861
01:24:05,699 --> 01:24:09,318
I want her so badly, I can taste it.
That's the whole point.

862
01:24:10,165 --> 01:24:14,579
She's done something to us.
She has us fighting over her somehow.

863
01:24:14,798 --> 01:24:18,215
I know she loves me and not you,
and it's driving you crazy.

864
01:24:18,470 --> 01:24:20,842
That's why you
stopped us from kissing.

865
01:24:21,015 --> 01:24:23,720
-You're not thinking straight.
-But I am.

866
01:24:24,812 --> 01:24:26,721
For the first time in a long time.

867
01:24:26,983 --> 01:24:29,439
I want a Robin signal
in the sky, all right?

868
01:24:29,653 --> 01:24:31,610
I'm tired of living
in your shadow.

869
01:24:31,824 --> 01:24:33,022
All that ends now.

870
01:24:38,125 --> 01:24:39,916
I'm sorry, Uncle.

871
01:24:41,213 --> 01:24:42,921
I was too late.

872
01:24:53,774 --> 01:24:56,479
You must do something for me.

873
01:24:58,615 --> 01:25:00,572
Find my brother, Wilfred. . .

874
01:25:00,785 --> 01:25:03,276
. . .your uncle,
wherever he is, and give him. . .

875
01:25:03,539 --> 01:25:04,570
. . .this.

876
01:25:04,791 --> 01:25:08,576
I have duties
that he must fulfill in my stead.

877
01:25:09,966 --> 01:25:12,422
Only family can be trusted.

878
01:25:13,346 --> 01:25:14,544
What is it?

879
01:25:15,099 --> 01:25:18,516
It is a sacred trust of two good men. . .

880
01:25:18,730 --> 01:25:21,815
. . .whom I have the honor
of calling "son. "

881
01:25:24,739 --> 01:25:26,019
Take it to Wilfred. . .

882
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:27,824
. . .and I implore you. . .

883
01:25:28,745 --> 01:25:30,204
. . .never open it.

884
01:25:33,628 --> 01:25:36,665
You look so like your mother.

885
01:25:40,221 --> 01:25:43,009
Bonsoir, glamorous Gothamites.

886
01:25:43,226 --> 01:25:45,135
Everyone who 's anyone...

887
01:25:45,313 --> 01:25:47,056
. . .has flocked to the observatory. . .

888
01:25:47,233 --> 01:25:51,398
. . .and tonight's star-studded
dedication of the new telescope.

889
01:25:56,246 --> 01:25:59,699
And here's the man
of the hour himself. . .

890
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:01,952
. . .Bruce Wayne.

891
01:26:05,135 --> 01:26:06,333
Excuse me.

892
01:26:09,183 --> 01:26:10,178
Commissioner.

893
01:26:10,351 --> 01:26:11,845
-How are you?
-Good. You know Julie?

894
01:26:12,063 --> 01:26:13,308
How are you?

895
01:26:13,523 --> 01:26:14,803
Good to see you.

896
01:26:17,196 --> 01:26:18,358
Young man.

897
01:26:20,159 --> 01:26:21,819
Lovely to see you again.

898
01:26:27,127 --> 01:26:28,289
Thank you.

899
01:26:28,922 --> 01:26:30,546
Commissioner Gordon. . .

900
01:26:33,095 --> 01:26:34,803
. . .I've always wondered. . .

901
01:26:35,015 --> 01:26:38,765
. . .where does that big,
old Batlight come from?

902
01:26:44,697 --> 01:26:46,072
Why. . .

903
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:47,070
. . .it's. . .

904
01:26:47,242 --> 01:26:49,400
. . .on top of Police Headquarters.

905
01:26:50,330 --> 01:26:51,528
I'd just. . .

906
01:26:51,790 --> 01:26:53,367
. . .Iove to see it.

907
01:26:53,585 --> 01:26:56,076
But you probably don't have access.

908
01:26:56,256 --> 01:26:57,501
Why, dear lady. . .

909
01:26:58,593 --> 01:27:01,001
. . .I am the police commissioner.

910
01:27:01,222 --> 01:27:04,177
I have the keys
right here in my pocket.

911
01:27:04,352 --> 01:27:05,894
Would you like to see it?

912
01:27:24,466 --> 01:27:27,468
Who are you, dear lady?

913
01:27:30,309 --> 01:27:33,228
On second thought,
you're way too old for me.

914
01:27:33,397 --> 01:27:35,105
No, I'm not.

915
01:27:36,277 --> 01:27:37,736
Please. . .

916
01:27:37,945 --> 01:27:39,569
. . .come back.

917
01:27:46,292 --> 01:27:48,331
What are you doing? Come on.

918
01:27:49,129 --> 01:27:51,501
Show me how the satellites work.

919
01:28:04,987 --> 01:28:06,018
First. . .

920
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:09,361
. . .I will turn Gotham into
an icy graveyard. . .

921
01:28:09,537 --> 01:28:10,402
. . .then. . .

922
01:28:10,621 --> 01:28:13,576
. . .I will pull Batman's heart
from his body. . .

923
01:28:13,835 --> 01:28:16,456
. . .and feel it freeze in my hands.

924
01:28:21,012 --> 01:28:21,925
Revenge!

925
01:28:23,391 --> 01:28:24,968
Quickly, Bane.

926
01:28:25,186 --> 01:28:26,384
Quickly now.

927
01:28:39,875 --> 01:28:41,951
Let there be light.

928
01:28:48,306 --> 01:28:50,678
Only family can be trusted?

929
01:28:53,647 --> 01:28:54,761
I'm family.

Everything I've done,

But I can't save you.

936

There's no defeat in death. . .

. . .Master Bruce.

938

your gun that counts.

953
01:32:38,664 --> 01:32:39,695
Where are you going?

954
01:32:39,873 --> 01:32:42,828
It's not a Batlight, it's a Robin signal.
Ivy's calling me.

955
01:32:43,004 --> 01:32:44,202
Her name's Pamela lsley.

956
01:32:44,381 --> 01:32:47,217
She must've stolen Gordon's keys
and changed the signal.

957
01:32:47,385 --> 01:32:48,796
She did it for me, for love.

958
01:32:48,971 --> 01:32:50,845
She infected us with pheromones.

959
01:32:51,058 --> 01:32:53,383
I'm under some kind of magic spell?

960
01:32:53,604 --> 01:32:54,766
She wants to kill you.

961
01:32:55,064 --> 01:32:57,637
You'd say anything to keep her
away from me.

962
01:32:57,818 --> 01:32:59,395
To keep her for yourself.

963
01:32:59,905 --> 01:33:02,574
You said being a team
means trusting your partner.

964
01:33:02,784 --> 01:33:07,281
Sometimes, counting on someone
else is the only way to win. Remember?

965
01:33:07,834 --> 01:33:11,619
You weren't talking about partners,
but about being a family.

966
01:33:12,299 --> 01:33:13,758
So I'm asking you. . .

967
01:33:13,927 --> 01:33:15,587
. . .friend, partner. . .

968
01:33:15,847 --> 01:33:16,842
. . .brother. . .

969
01:33:17,849 --> 01:33:19,723
. . .will you trust me now?

970
01:33:32,122 --> 01:33:34,827
-All the crystals are in place.
-Thank you.

971
01:33:44,349 --> 01:33:45,594
Hi!

972
01:33:45,810 --> 01:33:47,637
I'm sorry about the door.

973
01:33:48,564 --> 01:33:49,809
Is the party over?

974
01:33:52,903 --> 01:33:54,812
Who is this nutball?

975
01:34:34,385 --> 01:34:36,009
If revenge. . .

976
01:34:36,221 --> 01:34:38,593

01:34:42,146 --> 01:34:43,260
It's time. . .

979
01:34:43,607 --> 01:34:45,267
. . .to feast!

980
01:34:56,795 --> 01:34:57,957
Tonight. . .

981
01:34:58,255 --> 01:35:01,127
. . .hell freezes over.

982
01:35:40,571 --> 01:35:42,030
Intruder alert.

983
01:35:42,199 --> 01:35:43,361
Intruder alert.

984
01:35:45,704 --> 01:35:47,910
Intruder alert. Identify.

985
01:35:48,750 --> 01:35:51,206
Uncle Alfred, it's me. Barbara.

986
01:35:51,671 --> 01:35:54,590
I expected you might find
your way down here, child.

987
01:35:54,843 --> 01:35:57,215
I programmed my brain algorithms...

988
01:35:57,430 --> 01:35:58,924
...into the Batcomputer...

989
01:35:59,100 --> 01:36:02,636
...and created a virtual simulation.

990
01:36:02,939 --> 01:36:05,062
I'd like to help Batman and Robin.

991
01:36:05,234 --> 01:36:06,894
I anticipated you would...

992
01:36:07,112 --> 01:36:10,447
...and took the liberty
to create something in your size.

993
01:36:11,744 --> 01:36:13,867
Suit me up, Uncle Alfred.

994
01:37:34,791 --> 01:37:36,071
Hi there.

995
01:37:40,258 --> 01:37:42,963
Is your thumb the
only part of you that's green?

996
01:37:43,387 --> 01:37:46,259
You will just have to find out.

997
01:37:46,892 --> 01:37:48,766
I want us to be together, but. . .

998
01:37:48,938 --> 01:37:51,559
. . .you must be serious
about turning over a new leaf.

999
01:37:53,403 --> 01:37:54,268
I need a sign. . .

1000
01:37:55,281 --> 01:37:57,404
How about "Slippery when wet. "

1001
01:37:57,576 --> 01:37:58,774
. . .of trust.

1002
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:00,697
Tell me your plan.

1003
01:38:00,915 --> 01:38:02,409
Kiss me and I'll tell you.

1004
01:38:03,377 --> 01:38:05,286
Tell me and I'll kiss you.

1005
01:38:06,757 --> 01:38:11,504
Freeze has taken the new telescope
and turned it into a giant freezing gun.

1006
01:38:11,849 --> 01:38:14,422
He's about to turn Gotham
into an ice cube.

1007
01:38:15,771 --> 01:38:17,182
I've got to stop him.

1008
01:38:17,357 --> 01:38:18,519
One kiss. . .

1009
01:38:18,776 --> 01:38:19,807
. . .my love.

1010
01:38:20,988 --> 01:38:22,399
For luck.

1011
01:38:35,426 --> 01:38:37,253
Bad luck, I'm afraid.

1012
01:38:38,097 --> 01:38:40,089
Time to die, little Robin.

1013
01:38:43,314 --> 01:38:45,603
I hate to disappoint you, but. . .

1014
01:38:49,657 --> 01:38:52,362
. . .rubber lips are immune to
your charms.

1015
01:38:59,589 --> 01:39:00,869
See you!

1016
01:39:02,844 --> 01:39:05,597
You're not the only one
who can set a trap, Venus.

1017
01:39:06,016 --> 01:39:06,965
Sorry. . .

1018
01:39:07,184 --> 01:39:09,805
. . .my vines have a crush on you.

1019
01:39:17,659 --> 01:39:18,904
Got to go.

1020
01:39:19,077 --> 01:39:22,530
So many people to kill,
so little time.

1021
01:39:32,056 --> 01:39:33,716
You're about to become compost.

1022
01:39:41,446 --> 01:39:44,115
Using feminine wiles
to get what you want?

1023
01:39:44,284 --> 01:39:45,315
Trading on your looks?

1024
01:39:45,494 --> 01:39:46,407
Read a book.

1025
01:39:46,579 --> 01:39:49,035
That passive-aggressive
number went out long ago.

1026
01:39:49,250 --> 01:39:51,289
You give women a bad name.

1027
01:40:11,576 --> 01:40:15,445
As I told Lady Fries,
when I pulled her plug. . .

1028
01:40:15,999 --> 01:40:17,707
. . .this is a one-woman show.

1029
01:40:18,169 --> 01:40:19,497
I don't think so.

1030
01:40:41,247 --> 01:40:42,278
Curses!

1031
01:40:58,607 --> 01:41:00,231
Freeze is going to ice the city.

1032
01:41:00,444 --> 01:41:01,606
I know.

1033
01:41:01,820 --> 01:41:02,769
And you are?

1034
01:41:03,031 --> 01:41:04,062
Batgirl.

1035
01:41:04,283 --> 01:41:07,819
That's not P.C. What about
Batperson or Batwoman?

1036
01:41:08,206 --> 01:41:11,493
Bruce, it's me, Barbara.
I found the Batcave.

1037
01:41:11,711 --> 01:41:13,170
We must change the locks.

1038
01:41:13,381 --> 01:41:15,539
-She knows who we are.
-We must kill her.

1039
01:41:15,717 --> 01:41:18,042
Later. We have work to do.

1040
01:41:37,292 --> 01:41:40,294
Let's kick some ice.

1041
01:43:08,392 --> 01:43:10,634
We have 1 1 minutes
to thaw the city.

1042
01:43:38,147 --> 01:43:39,309
Gotcha!

1043
01:43:40,317 --> 01:43:41,312
Now!

1044
01:43:50,959 --> 01:43:52,287
Shield.

1045
01:44:14,329 --> 01:44:15,527
I'll finish off the city.

1046
01:44:15,706 --> 01:44:17,995
You kill the kids, but. . .

1047
01:44:18,168 --> 01:44:20,493
. . .Ieave me the Bat.

1048
01:44:40,745 --> 01:44:42,025
No sign of the snowman.

1049
01:44:42,790 --> 01:44:44,581
Maybe he melted.

1050
01:44:44,792 --> 01:44:46,915
No, he's just hibernating.

1051
01:45:04,782 --> 01:45:05,896
These heaters will thaw them.

1052
01:45:13,963 --> 01:45:16,086
I hope you've got
1 0 million more of those toys.

1053
01:45:16,467 --> 01:45:18,625
8 minutes
and they're ice cubes forever.

1054
01:45:18,804 --> 01:45:20,464
Sunlight could reverse
the freezing process.

1055
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:22,099
Sunrise isn't for 5 hours.

1056
01:45:22,267 --> 01:45:22,800
Here.

1057
01:45:22,977 --> 01:45:24,388
It's morning in the Congo.

1058
01:45:24,604 --> 01:45:25,635
We'll relay sunlight--

1059
01:45:25,814 --> 01:45:27,059
From below the equator--

1060
01:45:27,275 --> 01:45:29,944
It'll take the satellites
a minute to realign, but. . . .

1061
01:45:30,488 --> 01:45:31,104
Damn!

1062
01:45:31,281 --> 01:45:32,858
Damn?
Damn's not good.

1063
01:45:33,118 --> 01:45:35,739
Those targeting mirrors are frozen.

1064
01:45:35,955 --> 01:45:37,497
I realign, you thaw the mirrors.

1065
01:46:03,790 --> 01:46:05,201
Tonight's forecast:

1066
01:46:05,459 --> 01:46:07,333
A freeze is coming.

1067
01:46:21,693 --> 01:46:23,152
Bye-bye.

1068
01:46:36,132 --> 01:46:37,377
I got you!

1069
01:46:48,026 --> 01:46:50,102
No.
I got you.

1070
01:47:03,132 --> 01:47:04,923
It's one of those days!

1071
01:47:59,136 --> 01:48:00,713
Dirty fighter!

1072
01:48:16,079 --> 01:48:17,074
The tube!

1073
01:48:31,937 --> 01:48:32,850
Yay, Batman!

1074
01:48:46,417 --> 01:48:47,994
Hey, Freeze.

1075
01:48:48,212 --> 01:48:49,207
The heat is on.

1076
01:49:02,568 --> 01:49:04,395
You all right down there?

1077
01:49:05,989 --> 01:49:06,984
Here goes.

1078
01:49:36,037 --> 01:49:37,199
Hang on.

1079
01:49:53,105 --> 01:49:54,054
You're doing it!

1080
01:49:55,150 --> 01:49:57,059
You've lost, Freeze.

1081
01:49:57,611 --> 01:49:58,606
I think not.

1082
01:49:59,990 --> 01:50:01,614
Bombs away, Batman.

1083
01:50:26,031 --> 01:50:28,439
Freeze in hell, Batman!

1084
01:50:56,453 --> 01:50:58,077
What should we do now?

1085
01:50:58,289 --> 01:50:59,154
Pray.

1086
01:51:05,008 --> 01:51:06,502
Hang on!

1087
01:51:09,348 --> 01:51:11,257
Grab on to my belt!

1088
01:51:29,963 --> 01:51:31,587
Thank you, Batman!

1089
01:51:36,849 --> 01:51:37,844
Need a ride?

1090
01:51:49,035 --> 01:51:51,526
-Most of Gotham's still frozen.
-It's midnight.

1091
01:51:51,874 --> 01:51:54,495
Telescope's gone.
There's no way to thaw the city.

1092
01:51:54,670 --> 01:51:57,707
The satellites could do it,
but it'd take a computer genius.

1093
01:51:57,883 --> 01:51:58,878
I'm on it.

1094
01:51:59,593 --> 01:52:00,838
No, I'm on it.

1095
01:52:06,813 --> 01:52:08,224
Have to do it upside down.

1096
01:52:08,441 --> 01:52:11,014
Men!
Everything the hard way.

1097
01:52:13,616 --> 01:52:15,608
You're pretty good at this, little girl.

1098
01:52:17,288 --> 01:52:19,744
Watch and learn, little boy.

1099
01:53:26,770 --> 01:53:28,727
They say it'll be a beautiful day.

1100
01:53:37,078 --> 01:53:40,080
I'm taking you back
to Arkham Asylum.

1101
01:53:41,293 --> 01:53:42,752
Go on.

1102
01:53:43,630 --> 01:53:44,958
Kill me too.

1103
01:53:45,216 --> 01:53:46,793
Just as you killed my wife.

1104
01:53:47,010 --> 01:53:48,634
I didn't kill your wife.

1105
01:53:53,729 --> 01:53:57,728
As I told Lady Fries
when I pulled her plug...

1106
01:53:58,027 --> 01:54:00,399
... this is a one-woman show.

1107
01:54:06,123 --> 01:54:08,661
But she's not dead.

1108
01:54:08,794 --> 01:54:10,751
We found her,
restored her.

1109
01:54:11,298 --> 01:54:13,504
She's still frozen alive. . .

1110
01:54:13,802 --> 01:54:15,593
. . .waiting for you to find a cure.

1111
01:54:16,807 --> 01:54:18,550
She lives?

1112
01:54:20,812 --> 01:54:24,147
But vengeance isn't power.
Anyone can take a life.

1113
01:54:24,694 --> 01:54:26,318
But to give life. . .

1114
01:54:26,781 --> 01:54:29,653
. . .that's true power.
A power you once had.

1115
01:54:30,828 --> 01:54:32,702
She's alive.

1116
01:54:38,382 --> 01:54:40,006
So I'm asking you.

1117
01:54:41,011 --> 01:54:42,635
Victor Fries. . .

1118
01:54:43,473 --> 01:54:45,382
. . .help me save another life.

1119
01:54:45,810 --> 01:54:48,812
Show me how to cure
Macgregor's Syndrome Stage 1 .

1120
01:54:49,315 --> 01:54:53,100
And maybe you can also save the life
of the man your wife once loved.

1121
01:54:54,031 --> 01:54:56,107
He's still inside you, Victor.

1122
01:54:57,119 --> 01:54:58,198
Buried. . .

1123
01:54:58,496 --> 01:55:00,572
. . .deep beneath the snow.

1124
01:55:03,212 --> 01:55:04,872
Will you help me. . .

1125
01:55:06,425 --> 01:55:07,041
. . .Doctor?

1126
01:55:32,257 --> 01:55:34,249
Take 2 of these. . .

1127
01:55:35,554 --> 01:55:37,463
. . .and call me in the morning.

1128
01:55:48,031 --> 01:55:50,700
I'll have your wife
moved to the lab at Arkham.

1129
01:55:50,911 --> 01:55:53,283
You'll be able to continue
your research there.

1130
01:56:16,951 --> 01:56:19,109
All we can do now is wait. . .

1131
01:56:19,956 --> 01:56:21,783
. . .and hope.

1132
01:56:48,042 --> 01:56:49,869
He loves me.

1133
01:56:51,380 --> 01:56:53,207
He loves me not.

1134
01:56:55,553 --> 01:56:57,177
He loves me.

1135
01:56:59,059 --> 01:57:00,173
Not!

1136
01:57:02,063 --> 01:57:03,557
Surprise.

1137
01:57:03,774 --> 01:57:05,766
I'm your new cellmate.

1138
01:57:08,156 --> 01:57:11,360
And I've come
to make your life a living hell.

1139
01:57:12,371 --> 01:57:13,320
Prepare. . .

1140
01:57:13,581 --> 01:57:15,372
. . .for a bitter harvest.

1141
01:57:19,089 --> 01:57:20,251
Winter. . .

1142
01:57:20,592 --> 01:57:22,584
. . .has come at last.

1143
01:58:08,249 --> 01:58:09,079
Are you. . .?

1144
01:58:09,250 --> 01:58:14,044
Rather disappointed at how poorly
I have taught you proper housekeeping.

1145
01:58:14,508 --> 01:58:16,335
And quite well, it seems!

1146
01:58:16,804 --> 01:58:18,179
Thanks to you, son.

1147
01:58:18,348 --> 01:58:20,590
Thanks to you all.

1148
01:58:20,811 --> 01:58:22,388
Well done, Bruce.

1149
01:58:22,771 --> 01:58:24,847
You too.
Well done.

1150
01:58:26,194 --> 01:58:27,736
I got one question.

1151
01:58:28,071 --> 01:58:31,773
When we fell off the telescope,
why didn't you try and save us?

1152
01:58:31,994 --> 01:58:34,152
It's the first time I've fallen
and you weren't there.

1153
01:58:34,832 --> 01:58:36,112
I figured you could handle it.

1154
01:58:36,292 --> 01:58:41,002
You know, sometimes counting on
somebody else is the only way to win.

1155
01:58:43,888 --> 01:58:44,718
Excuse me.

1156
01:58:44,890 --> 01:58:47,346
I'm the one who
kicked lvy's botanical butt.

1157
01:58:47,519 --> 01:58:48,633
Yeah, that was me.

1158
01:58:48,854 --> 01:58:50,182
I did it all by myself.

1159
01:58:50,440 --> 01:58:51,389
That was me.

1160
01:58:51,650 --> 01:58:53,892
You are going back to school.

1161
01:58:54,112 --> 01:58:55,820
You'll never win this argument.

1162
01:59:00,914 --> 01:59:02,076
Partners?

1163
01:59:07,091 --> 01:59:07,921
Partners.

1164
01:59:17,440 --> 01:59:19,231
Partners.

1165
01:59:22,700 --> 01:59:24,776
We're going to need a bigger cave.

1166
00:00:00,000 --> 01:60:39,636
