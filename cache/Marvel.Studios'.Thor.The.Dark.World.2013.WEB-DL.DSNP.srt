-Yes, of course I'm alive.
-What are you doing here?

659
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,640
What do you mean,
what am I doing?

660
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,720
I'm stuck
in this stupid chair.

661
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,080
-Where's your chair?
-I didn't get a chair.

662
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,720
-Get me out of this one.
-I can't.

663
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,200
-Get me out. What?
-I can't.

664
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,240
I've made friends
with this man.

665
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,360
He's called the Grandmaster.

666
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,560
-Oh, he's crazy!
-I've gained his favor.

667
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,280
The Bifrost brought me
out here weeks ago.

668
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,560
-Weeks ago?
-Yes.

669
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,840
I just got here.

670
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,080
(WHISPERS) What are you
whispering about?

671
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,240
(YELPS)

672
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,960
Time works real different
around these parts.

673
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,200
On any other world, I'd be,
like, millions of years old.

674
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,960
But here on Sakaar...

675
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,040
(MUSIC CONTINUES)

676
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,080
In any case,
you know this, uh...

677
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,520
You call yourself
Lord of Thunder?

678
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,920
God of Thunder.
Tell him.

679
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,840
I've never met this man
in my life.

680
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,600
-He's my brother.
-Adopted.

681
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,760
Is he any kind of a fighter?

682
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,240
(LAUGHS) You take this thing

683
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,280
out of my neck
and I'll show you.

684
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,120
Now, listen to that.
He's threatening me.

685
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,280
Hey, Sparkles,
here's the deal.

686
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,600
If you wanna get back
to Ass-place, Assberg...

687
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:47,960
Asgard.

688
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,920
Any contender who defeats
my champion...

689
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,800
their freedom they shall win.

690
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,640
Fine. Then point me
in the direction

691
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,160
of whoever's ass
I have to kick!

692
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,960
That's what I call, contender.

693
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,440
Direction would be
this way, Lord.

694
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,120
Ah! Loki!

695
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,720
(GRUNTING)

696
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,000
Hey, hey, hey.
Take it easy, man.

697
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,800
-(PANTING)
-Over here.

698
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,480
The pile of rocks
waving at you. Here.

699
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,200
Yeah, I'm actually a thing.
I'm a being.

700
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,000
Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Korg.

701
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,440
I'm kind of like
the leader in here.

702
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,480
I'm made of rocks,
as you can see.

703
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,000
But don't let that
intimidate you.

704
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,480
You don't need to be afraid

705
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,120
unless you're
made of scissors. (CHUCKLES)

706
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,480
Just a little
rock-paper-scissor

707
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,560
joke for you.

708
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,480
This is my very good friend
over here, Miek.

709
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,360
He's an insect
and has knives for hands.

710
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,440
You're a Kronan, aren't you?

711
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:41,280
-That I am.
-How'd you end up in here?

712
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,200
Ah, well, I tried to start
a revolution,

713
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,320
but didn't print
enough pamphlets.

714
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,000
So hardly anyone turned up,

715
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,680
except for my mum
and her boyfriend, who I hate.

716
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,360
As punishment, I was forced

717
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,800
to be in here
and become a gladiator.

718
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,320
Bit of a promotional disaster,
that one.

719
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,200
But I'm actually organizing
another revolution.

720
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,520
I don't know
if you'd be interested

721
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,640
in something like that.

722
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,360
Do you reckon
you'd be interested?

723
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,680
How did you...

724
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,520
Ah, yeah, no.
This whole thing is a circle.

725
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,880
But not a real circle,
more like a freaky circle.

726
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,360
This doesn't make any sense.

727
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,680
No, nothing makes sense
here, man.

728
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,360
The only thing
that does make sense

729
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,840
is that nothing makes sense.

730
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,360
Has anyone here fought
the Grandmaster's champion?

731
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,680
Doug has.

732
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:21,840
Doug!

733
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,040
Our luck, Doug's dead.

734
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,160
That's right.

735
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,360
Everyone who fights

736
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,560
the Grandmaster's champion
perishes.

737
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,560
What about you?
You're made of rocks.

738
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:31,400
Perishable rock. There you go.
Another one gone.

739
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,440
Yeah, no, I just do
the smaller fights,

740
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,400
warm up the crowd and whatnot.

741
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,280
Wait. You're not gonna
face him, are you?

742
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,880
Yes, I am.

743
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,960
Gonna fight him, win,

744
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,360
and get the hell out
of this place.

745
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,840
That's exactly
what Doug used to say.

746
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,880
See you later, new Doug.

747
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,400
Does no one remember me?

748
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:01,440
Has no one been taught
our history?

749
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,600
Look at these lies.

750
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,760
Goblets and garden parties?

751
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,720
Peace treaties?

752
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,760
Odin...

753
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,480
proud to have it...

754
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,040
ashamed of how he got it.

755
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,440
(GRUNTING)

756
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,600
We were unstoppable.

757
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,640
I was his weapon
in the conquest

758
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,120
that built Asgard's empire.

759
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,280
One by one,
the realms became ours.

760
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:56,640
But then, simply because
my ambition outgrew his...

761
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:01,480
he banished me, caged me,
locked me away like an animal.

762
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:04,520
Before that, Asgard's warriors
were honored...

763
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,320
their bodies buried as heroes
beneath this very palace.

Most of the stuff in here
is fake.

00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:27,800
Or weak.

768
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,840
Smaller than I thought
it would be.

769
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,520
That's not bad.

770
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,320

Being lied to.

788
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,560
Being told you're one thing

789
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:39,480
and then learning
it's all a fiction.

You didn't think I'd really
come and see you, did you?

you don't want my help?

you could join me

Hammer?

844

special metal from the heart
of a dying star.

And when I spun it really,
really fast,

00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:06,000
it gave me the ability to fly.

The hammer rode you
on your back?

851

No. I used to spin it
really fast,

off the...

off the ground,

855
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:19,800
up into the air,
and I would fly.

856

Every time I threw it,

857
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,960
it would always
come back to me.

858
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,480
Sounds like you had
a pretty special

859

and intimate relationship
with this hammer...

860
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,120
and that losing it

861
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,960
was almost comparable
to losing a loved one.

of putting it.

you were all women.

-Yeah.

1324
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,200
What happened to your hair?

1325
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:37,720
Some creepy old man
cut it off.

1326
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,240
-It looks good.
-Oh, thanks.

Where are we? Oh, how's Nat?

1328
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:44,880
-Uh, Nat is good, I'm sure.
-Is she okay?

1329
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:46,880
-And what about Sokovia?
-Sokovia?

1330
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:48,560
The city, Sokovia.
Did we save it?

1331
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:49,880
-Banner, listen.
-What?

1332
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:52,040
Sokovia. Ultron.
That was two years ago.

1333
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:53,720
-What are you saying?
-Well...

1334

What?

1335
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:57,200
I've been Hulk for two years?

BANNER: Who's that?

1356
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:45,760
He kind of runs the place.

1357
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:47,920
You actually lived
at his house for awhile.

1358
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:49,080
-I did?
-Yeah.

This is really, really bad.

I'm freaking out.

No, no, no.

Don't freak out. You're okay.
Put these on.

1373
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:21,680
These are Tony's clothes.

1374

-I know, come on.
-Is he here?

1375
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:25,160
No, he's not here. But listen.
Just stay calm, okay?

The sun's getting really low.

I'm very upset.

You know what I like about
being upset? The blame.

1381
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:47,640
Right now, that's
the mindset that I'm in.

1382
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:48,680
And you know who I'm blaming?

1383
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:50,480
-Grandmaster, I can...
-Hey!

1384
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:51,640
Don't interrupt me!

1385
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:52,840
Here you go.

1386
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:54,960
Why are you handing me
the melt stick?

1387
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:56,920
He was interrupting.

1388
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:58,960
That's not
a capital violation.

1389

Where was I?

1390
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:03,320
My precious champion
has come up missing...

1391
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:05,520
and it's all because
of that Lord of Thunder.

1392
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:07,800
It's all because of him.
Your brother.

1393
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:10,960
Whatever the story is.
Adopted, or complicated.

1394
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:12,120
I'm sure
there's a big history.

1395
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:13,360
And your contender...

1396
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:15,120
LOKI: My dear friend...

1397
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:17,200
if you were to give me
12 hours,

1398
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:18,680
I could bring them both
back to you. Alive.

1399
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:20,360
I could do it in two.

1400
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:22,360
I could do it in one.

1401
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:23,560
Let's stop there.

1402
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:25,520
You know what?
I woke up this morning

1403
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:27,320
thinking about
a public execution.

1404
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:29,360
But for now, I'll settle
for this sweet little...

1405
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:32,360
(EXCLAIMS)
"Who's gonna get him first?"

1406
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:36,000
So, you're on the clock.

1407
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,040
What have you done?

1408
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:40,400
I don't answer to you, lackey.

1409
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:41,560
It's Loki.

1410
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:43,200
And you will answer
to the Grandmaster.

1411
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:46,240
-(GRUNTS)
-Hmm.

1412
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:49,240
Why would you help my brother
escape with that green fool?

1413
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:50,720
I don't help anyone.

1414
01:18:57,400 --> 01:18:58,400
You're a Valkyrie.

1415
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:05,520
I thought the Valkyrie had
all died gruesome deaths.

1416
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:08,400
Choose your next words wisely.

1417
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:11,880
I'm terribly sorry.
Must be a very painful memory.

1418
01:19:58,600 --> 01:19:59,600
(GRUNTS)

1419
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,120
THOR: The sun's going down.
It's getting really low.

1420
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:09,680
The sun's going down.

1421
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:11,240
-It's getting real low.
-Oh, shoot.

1422
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:13,800
-Sun's getting low.
-Would you stop saying that?

1423
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:14,960
I just need you to stay calm.

1424
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:17,000
Calm? I'm on an alien planet!

1425
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:18,960
It's just a planet. You've
been on a planet before.

1426
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,040
Yeah. One.

1427
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:21,960
Now you've been on two.
That's a good thing.

1428
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:23,320
It's a new experience.

1429
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:25,480
My neurons,
they're firing faster

1430
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:27,560
than my brain can handle
the information.

1431
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:30,000
The whole thing is totally
different this time.

1432
01:20:30,280 --> 01:20:32,000
In the past, I always felt
like Hulk and I

1433
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:33,320
each had a hand on the wheel.

1434
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:35,400
But this time, it's like
he had the keys

1435
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:37,000
to the car and I was
locked in the trunk.

1436
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:39,040
All right, well, you're back
now. That's all that matters.

1437
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:40,320
No, it's not what matters.

1438
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:41,600
What I'm trying
to tell you, is that

1439
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:43,160
if I turn into
the Hulk again...

1440
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:44,840
Banner may never come back.

1441
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:46,360
And we're stranded on a planet

1442
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:48,160
that is designed
to stress me out.

1443
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:49,360
We're not stranded.

1444
01:20:49,480 --> 01:20:50,800
I'm gonna figure out a way
to get us home.

1445
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:52,360
Thank you.

1446
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:54,680
Not your home, though. Asgard.
My home.

1447
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:56,000
What?

1448
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:57,840
Listen, my people
are in great danger.

1449
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:00,640
You and I, we have to fight
this really powerful being...

1450
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:02,640
who also happens
to be my sister.

1451
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:04,520
Okay, that is so wrong
on so many...

1452
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:05,880
I don't wanna
fight your sister.

1453
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:07,200
That's a family issue.

1454
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:08,520
No, she's an evil being.

1455
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:10,440
I don't care what she is.

1456
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:12,720
I'm not fighting any
more beings. I'm sick of it.

1457
01:21:12,920 --> 01:21:13,920
-What?
-I just told you.

1458
01:21:14,280 --> 01:21:15,760
If I turn into the Hulk,

1459
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:17,040
I am never gonna
come back again.

1460
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:18,280
And you don't care.

1461
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:20,160
No, no. I'm putting together
the team.

1462
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:21,680
The Hulk is the fire.

1463
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,640
Wait, you're just using me
to get to the Hulk.

1464
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:25,280
-What? No!
-It's gross.

1465
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:27,200
You don't care about me.
You're not my friend.

1466
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:29,200
No! I don't even
like the Hulk.

1467
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:30,560
He's all like...

1468
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:32,080
"Smash, smash, smash."

1469
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:33,400
I prefer you.

1470
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:35,320
Thanks.

1471
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:37,680
But if I'm being honest,

1472
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:39,120
when it comes
to fighting evil beings...

1473
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:40,680
he is very powerful
and useful.

1474
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:42,760
Yeah, Banner's powerful
and useful, too.

1475
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:44,200
Is he though?

1476
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:46,480
How many PhDs
does Hulk have? Zero.

1477
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:48,400
How many PhDs does
Banner have? Seven.

1478
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:51,240
Fine, you don't have
to fight anyone.

1479
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:53,280
But we're in danger here,
so we have to move.

1480
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:58,480
What are you doing with that?

1481
01:21:58,680 --> 01:21:59,680
I need a disguise.
I'm a fugitive.

1482
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:01,440
-I need a disguise.
-You are the disguise.

1483
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:03,760
-I'll be Tony Stark.
-What?

1484
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:05,720
Yeah. Tony and the gypsy.

1485
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:08,440
No, no, you're not Tony.
You're Bruce. Bruce Banner.

1486
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:09,880
Then why did you dress me up
like Tony?

1487
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:11,080
Because you were naked.

1488
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:12,440
Okay, I'll give you that.

1489
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:14,560
What are you doing?
Stop doing that!

1490
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:15,960
Tony wears his pants
super tight.

1491
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:17,120
-Stop it!
-I'm sorry.

1492
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:19,440
-Why are you being so weird?
-I don't know.

1493
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:21,920
Maybe the fact that I was
trapped for two years...

1494
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:24,600
inside of a monster
made me a little weird.

1495
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:26,520
Hey. Shh. It's okay.

Yeah, well, I did it first.

That's good.

What are you doing here?
I thought you were leaving.

I got sidetracked.

I like what you did with it.

Are those the people

-THOR: Mmm.

the best place

to drink and forget,
and to die one day.

that you drink too much,

and that probably
was gonna kill you.

Because I'm getting revenge.
You're getting revenge.

to kill everybody.

it was called that
when I picked it.

without the on-board computer.

and access to a ship...

through the Anus.

to kill any of us.

1615

There was one time
when we were children...

1618
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:58,040
he transformed himself
into a snake,

1619
01:26:58,120 --> 01:26:59,200
and he knows
that I love snakes.

1620
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:01,200
So, I went to pick up
the snake to admire it...

1621
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:02,880
and he transformed back
into himself

1622
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:04,160
and he was like,
"Yeah, it's me!"

1623
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:07,240
And he stabbed me.
We were eight at the time.

No, there's no beast.
He's just being stupid.

some sort of protoplasm,

1634
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:27,720

that's coming out of you...

1635

It's almost poetic that his
death should split us apart.
