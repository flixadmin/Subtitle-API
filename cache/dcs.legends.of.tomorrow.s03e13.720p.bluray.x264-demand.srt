1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,600
<i>Previously on</i>
Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:06,708
<i>Here's to being two regular women
on a completely normal first date.</i>

3
00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:08,382
<i>Wally West.</i>

4
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:11,343
I am trying to save the universe.
Care to join me?

5
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:15,342
<i>When Nora was possessed
by Mallus, he seemed scared of my totem.</i>

6
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:17,173
<i>You're one of the six.</i>

7
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:19,138
The hunt for the six totems
has begun.

8
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:20,430
Good evening, Miss Jiwe.

9
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:21,896
No.

10
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,764
Darling... Wait.

11
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:27,684
He may be of value.

12
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:35,428
You know what, Gideon,
I think I'll have

13
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:36,988
some more of your
amazing French toast.

14
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,162
You must've worked up
an appetite last night.

15
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:43,033
Sara, can we take the <i>Waverider</i>

16
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:45,407
to when Mount St. Helens erupted?
I've always wanted to...

17
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:49,172
Psych. That would not
be a cool thing to do.

18
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:51,754
This is a very important
time vehicle.

19
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:54,756
We would never use it for
recreational or dangerous purposes.

20
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:56,595
Hey, Ava.

21
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:59,966
You look great in what you were
wearing yesterday.

22
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,019
- Right.
- I'm going to stop talking now. Yeah.

23
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:04,272
Hey, Zari.

24
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:07,516
This is weird.
Why are there so many dirty dishes?

25
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:09,229
Ray loves doing dirty dishes.

26
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,319
Oh, yeah.

27
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:12,465
I also don't hear him spewing
the neurological benefits

28
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:13,716
of putting butter in his coffee.

29
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,072
Gideon, where's Ray?

30
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:16,399
<i>I don't know.</i>

31
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:18,489
<i>But we are being hailed
by the Time Bureau.</i>

32
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,163
Put them on.

33
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:24,832
<i>Hello, Legends, and, uh, Agent Sharpe.</i>

34
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:25,918
What is it, Gary?

35
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:28,411
<i>Uh... This was just delivered to us.</i>

36
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:30,960
<i>There was a Palmer Tech phone
hidden inside</i>

37
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,290
<i>with a message recorded on it.</i>

38
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:38,255
<i>Hey, guys, if you're finding this,
it's me, Ray, obviously.</i>

39
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:39,617
<i>You've probably guessed by now</i>

40
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,473
<i>that I have been abducted
by the Darhks.</i>

41
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:45,012
Hey, when we see him, do we tell him
we didn't even notice he was gone?

42
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:46,308
Yeah, definitely not.

43
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:49,607
<i>Darhk said that they would let go
of me when they were done with me.</i>

44
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,944
<i>He is asking me if I want to see
a Grateful Dead concert,</i>

45
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,113
<i>which is really kind of weird.</i>

46
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:57,532
<i>But, look, you'll probably
try to come after me,</i>

47
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:58,826
<i>and find me.</i>

48
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,597
<i>If you do,
he said that he'll kill me.</i>

49
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:02,954
<i>So, you know, please don't do that.</i>

50
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,206
<i>Okay. Bye.</i>

51
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:07,954
Okay, I've done as you asked.

52
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,998
So no more torture today, right?

53
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:16,133
I really don't think you understand
how this whole torture thing works.

54
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:29,810
Work. Work. Work.

55
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,732
Come on, why won't
this stupid thing work?

56
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:35,061
That stupid thing has been
in my family for generations.

57
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,025
It should've been mine.

58
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,481
Well, it's mine now.

59
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:42,027
Besides, Mallus wishes for only
his most devoted followers

60
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,578
to wield totems
and you already have one.

61
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,327
Now, why can't I access its powers?

62
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,451
Because power is all it is to you.

63
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,211
Until you find a selfless reason
to wield it,

64
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,923
my grandmother's bond to the totem
even at a distance

65
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,501
will remain stronger than yours.

66
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:01,470
What about this Fire Totem
I stole in Detroit?

67
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:03,969
Afraid of a broken trinket?

68
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:05,766
That thing killed me once.

69
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:08,185
Even in pieces,
it's still to be feared.

70
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:09,891
Totems are eternal.

71
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:11,517
They can never be destroyed.

72
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:12,933
So they can be fixed.

73
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:15,276
Ooh. So I can get a necklace myself.

74
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:18,105
It would take a truly brilliant mind
to figure out how.

75
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,484
You guys hungry?

76
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,818
I could really go for some eggs,
poached, runny.

77
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:24,614
Oh, my coffee.

78
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:26,742
With grass-fed butter
and MCT oil.

79
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,832
Are you sure we should be looking
for Ray after he told us not to?

80
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,401
What the hell are you doing here?

81
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:37,425
Ditto.

82
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:39,626
I thought you said
they'd be psyched to see us.

83
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,406
Look, I know what
you're both thinking,

84
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,532
but if you'd just let me explain.

85
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,534
If you're here to apologize
for burgling the Bureau,

86
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:46,345
and humiliating Gary, then...

87
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:48,195
Well, we actually did that
for a good reason,

88
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,636
because we have to stop Mollusk.

89
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:50,730
- Mallus.
- Mallus.

90
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:53,042
And, yes, we know all about him.
Sara basically met him.

91
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,932
And you're here
because the Time Bureau

92
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:57,109
has finally come to its senses, or...

93
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:58,195
Ava and I are...

94
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,693
Working together, uh, independently.

95
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,653
Right. Wally, it's good to see you.

96
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,861
I remember you
from Barry and Iris' wedding.

97
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,195
Yeah, wasn't that so fun?

98
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:08,871
It was such a beautiful ceremony.

99
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,619
The hors d'oeuvres were like, meh.

100
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,834
- And then the Nazi invasion.
- The what?

101
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:15,022
All right, you guys still haven't
told us why you're on the ship.

102
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,046
Atoning.

103
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:17,673
I hope.

104
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:19,558
I should never have kept you both
in the dark.

105
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:22,461
The deaths of those agents
and the return of Damien Darhk

106
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:24,386
will haunt me
for the rest of my days.

107
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,257
But, surely, you understand
the gravity now

108
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,350
of what we're facing.

109
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,871
- Hey.
- Nate, my brother.

110
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:31,261
What are you doing here?

111
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,808
- Hey, man.
- Oh, man.

112
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:35,310
What the hell are you doing here?

113
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:36,609
Any sign of Ray?

114
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:39,526
Uh, no, just another Grateful Dead end.

115
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:41,525
I, for sure, got a contact high.

116
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:42,615
Yeah.

117
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:46,192
I managed to swipe
Jerry Garcia's glasses.

118
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,411
Hold on.

119
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,696
Once a thief, always a thief.

120
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:55,118
No, we allow light
to moderate theft on the ship.

121
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:56,835
We like to call them souvenirs.

122
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:00,376
- Oh.
- It's okay. It's okay.

123
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:06,889
<i>No, no, no.</i>

124
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:09,306
Nope. Not gonna do it.

125
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:11,851
You and I both realize
that your idiot friends

126
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:13,623
are going to search every Dead show
in history

127
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:16,230
before they realize that I don't even
like jam bands.

128
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:19,233
Be that as it may,

129
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,815
I will not fix the Fire Totem.

130
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,280
Sorry.

131
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,009
You're going to have to kill me.

132
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,524
Ugh. Well, suit yourself.

133
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:28,075
No, no, hold on a second, sweetie.

134
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,619
I think I'm going to give this suit
to Genghis Khan.

135
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,016
Imagine what history would be like

136
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,784
if the Mongols had a
dwarf star-powered rocket man.

137
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,297
The Legends would just find
the anachronism and fix it.

138
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:43,588
Good point.
"Way to go, Ray."

139
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,674
Maybe I will just murder
a young Sandy Palmer

140
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:52,008
picking her sons up from
Ivy Springs day care in 1982.

141
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,480
I'll need a lab.

142
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:05,155
Hi, Alan.

143
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:06,574
Sorry, Alan.

144
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,236
What the hell, Ray, you quit.

145
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,109
There's no take-backs at Upswipz.

146
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,612
Oh! You're the up and down guy.

147
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:14,454
Me? I prefer side to side.

148
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:23,002
Our focus groups found up and down
was more intuitive.

149
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:26,634
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

150
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:32,257
You know, he might be right.

151
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:33,883
We think it's just a paradigm.

152
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:38,350
You have your lab,
now, get to work, nerd.

153
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:46,859
We're still not any closer
to finding Ray.

154
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,985
Nate, I need you hitting those books.

155
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,441
Look for any sign of him.

156
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:53,869
Gideon, scan the anachronism map,
something pops up, you let us know.

157
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:55,363
- Rory...
- Crush a six-pack.

158
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:56,457
You do what you do.

159
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,908
I'll head back to the Bureau,
put our resources on it too.

160
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,327
I have an idea.

161
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:02,874
It's a little experimental.

162
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,256
I'm listening.

163
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:06,799
Well, we know that Ray is with
the Darhks, and so is my totem.

164
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:09,585
If I meditate with Zari
using her totem to anchor me,

165
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,591
I think I can reach out
to the ancestral plane.

166
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,506
If we find my totem...

167
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,600
Then you find Ray.

168
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:15,726
Meditation?

169
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,413
I've actually been
doing a lot of that

170
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,894
and I think I could help you.

171
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,141
Perfect. Make it happen.

172
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:24,684
Sweetie, you think it's too early
for me to, you know,

173
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:26,769
get back out there?

174
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:29,105
I mean, how long should I
mourn your mother?

175
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:31,699
It's been 23 years on my end, Dad.

176
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,321
I say go for it.

177
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:34,578
Thank you.

178
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,891
Trouble is I haven't had
a single match yet.

179
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,372
I think the thing is broken.

180
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,458
If I may.

181
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:43,457
You might have more luck
if you talk about your hobbies.

182
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:47,298
I just said that I enjoy destroying
the world to remake it in my image.

183
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:50,384
Oh! I like trying new restaurants.

184
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,178
Also, your profile says
you're 199 years old.

185
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:55,506
Yeah, it wouldn't go any higher.
Can you fix that?

186
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,554
Well, everyone lies
about their age, bruh.

187
00:07:57,686 --> 00:07:59,080
Can you please stop fooling around?

188
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:02,063
Nora doll, what's the point of living
if you can't have a bit of fun?

189
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,726
Well, I'm not enjoying myself.

190
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,025
I'm annoyed.

191
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,318
Hi, Annoyed. I'm Dad.

192
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,361
Right? That's good.

193
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,572
Fine.

194
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:15,828
No!

195
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,990
Okay, I have analyzed the shards.

196
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,519
We'd have to go back to the big bang

197
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:23,956
in order to get enough energy
to reignite the Fire Totem.

198
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,788
That, or invent cold fusion,
and since that's not possible...

199
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:27,923
Yes, it is.

200
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:30,216
Cold fusion was invented in 1962

201
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,714
by a German physicist
named Bernhardt Vogel.

202
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:36,302
Yeah, no,
see, I'm kind of a science dork.

203
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:38,007
- Kind of?
- And if someone had invented

204
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:40,639
cold fusion, let alone in 1962,
I think I'd have heard of it.

205
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:41,854
Actually,

206
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,935
there's a very good reason
why you haven't.

207
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:49,440
<i>The reason you've never heard
of Bernhardt Vogel</i>

208
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,237
<i>is because the most ruthless
and efficient assassin</i>

209
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:57,034
<i>the world has ever known
made sure that no one ever did.</i>

210
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:58,829
<i>Me.</i>

211
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:09,463
Killing Vogel
was one of my greatest hits.

212
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:13,084
Someone developed an energy source
that could have replaced fossil fuels

213
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,710
and, essentially, saved the world?

214
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,841
While putting the oil industry
out of business.

215
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,973
Some very powerful people
with some very deep pockets

216
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,222
<i>wouldn't stand for it,
so they hired me.</i>

217
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:25,562
<i>He was waiting for transfer, holed up
in an East Berlin safe house.</i>

218
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:28,561
<i>Somewhat of a misnomer in this case
when your old man got involved.</i>

219
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:33,775
<i>And you buried the secret
to cold fusion.</i>

220
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,364
<i>And the man who created it.</i>

221
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:36,903
Yeah, I know.
That was implied.

222
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:41,203
Well, I guess I'm off to East Berlin
to stop myself from killing Vogel.

223
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:42,289
Should be fun.

224
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,685
You watch the prisoner,
I'll bring you back some chocolate.

225
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:45,709
Oh, who am I kidding?

226
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:47,674
I'm probably going to get
a hat for myself, too.

227
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,453
No, I'm going.

228
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:51,543
To 1962 Berlin?

229
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:52,633
Too dangerous.

230
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,216
If your younger self sees you,

231
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,669
it could change the course
of your entire life.

232
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,800
All right, obviously,
you haven't been listening.

233
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:01,891
We're talking about going back
against me, in my prime.

234
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,717
You don't stand a chance, Nora doll.

235
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:05,599
We're partners.
I can do this mission.

236
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,645
Or you could just
call the whole thing off.

237
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:10,315
This is obviously causing
a lot of family tension.

238
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:11,642
- Shut up.
- Shut up.

239
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:13,189
All right, tell me your plan.

240
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:16,029
We return to 1962
and convince Dr. Vogel

241
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,153
that we're American agents,
there to help him.

242
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:19,905
Then we jump straight back
to this moment.

243
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,578
Oh. Sorry, "we"?
Are you taking him?

244
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,951
Dr. Vogel needs to trust us, fast,

245
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,790
which means, he needs a peer.

246
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:28,583
Someone who speaks nerd.

247
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,331
Hmm.

248
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:33,547
You better come right back, you two,
do you understand me?

249
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,999
And use protection.

250
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,841
Ew.

251
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:44,724
I think he's warming to me.

252
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,222
Get up, move! God.

253
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,378
Follow my lead,
and we'll be out of here

254
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:53,813
before my dad even shows up.

255
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,233
My God!

256
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,861
Shh. Be quiet and listen.
Your life depends on it.

257
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:00,987
Are you decent?

258
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:07,076
We're with the CIA.
Here to take you back to America.

259
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,703
No. West Berlin.

260
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,020
As I told your British friends,

261
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:12,331
I will not speak a word
about cold fusion

262
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:14,129
until I'm reunited with my family.

263
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,831
Touching, but not our mission.

264
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,285
We'll get you back to your family,

265
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,446
but first you have to come with us,
it's not safe here.

266
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,407
Wait, I have to get something
from the other room.

267
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,471
- A doll for my daughter.
- No. No, there's no time.

268
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:25,598
There's an assassin
on his way here right now.

269
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:27,389
Trust me, he's not very nice.

270
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,700
I will not leave here
without that doll.

271
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,114
Can I hurt him yet?

272
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:47,206
Hurt me?

273
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,157
Wait, you're not CIA.

274
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:50,870
Help!

275
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:54,254
Release him.

276
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:55,422
Stand back.

277
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,258
Huh?

278
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,426
Oh, crap.

279
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,788
What happened to your magic fingers?

280
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,429
That virus you shot me with
must be affecting my powers.

281
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,168
We got to get out of here
before more guards come in,

282
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:15,192
or, worse, your dad.

283
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:16,809
Dr. Vogel.

284
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:19,235
Hey. We're here to save you.

285
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:23,033
Who are you? Hey!

286
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,272
See? Who needs magic?

287
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,279
Run.

288
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,403
Okay, I believe you.

289
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:07,911
Get me out of here.

290
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,283
Time-jump us out of here.

291
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,286
Oh, crap, there goes our exit.

292
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:19,295
Well, back to basics.

293
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:46,240
So, I just eat this Lyoga root,
and it's, boom, vision quest?

294
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:47,576
No.

295
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:48,702
That much would kill you.

296
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:52,409
This tea is plenty to take you
to the world between worlds.

297
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,582
We'll use your totem to anchor us
while we look for any signs of mine.

298
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,417
And, hopefully, Ray along with it.

299
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,371
The incense will calm you
and I'm just going to ease you

300
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:02,923
into the altered state
through some guided meditation.

301
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,128
Thank you for helping us.

302
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:06,196
So how do you know Nathaniel?

303
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,633
I was kind of like his wingman
back in Central City.

304
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:10,492
Just helped him get
over a broken heart, actually,

305
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:13,304
because this basic bitch just
dumped him on his birthday.

306
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,010
Can you believe that?

307
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:16,772
Yeah.

308
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,392
'Cause I was actually
that basic bitch.

309
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:21,558
Great vibe, Wally,
I think we can take it from here.

310
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,063
Yeah, okay, I'm going to go.

311
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:24,821
Okay.

312
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:31,573
No worries, that's a classic
first-attempt blunder.

313
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:33,015
Happens to the Legends all the time.

314
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,475
Sometimes twice on the same mission.

315
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:37,242
All we need to do is regroup
and come up with plan B.

316
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:38,335
Hey, what are you doing?

317
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:39,419
Plan B.

318
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:42,079
Tell us the formula for cold fusion
or I'll break your fingers.

319
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:43,173
No.

320
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:44,668
The formula can die with me.

321
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,128
I'm not going to kill you.

322
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,376
You'll just wish I had.

323
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,677
Nora, just put it down.

324
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,129
Torture is not the answer.

325
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,096
Yeah, but it's fun either way.

326
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:53,183
Do your worst.

327
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:55,676
I have already faced
the most terrible pain

328
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,887
that a man can endure.

329
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,190
Or expected.

330
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:03,183
He will never again see the ones
he holds most dear.

331
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,604
The doll, it's your daughter's.

332
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,648
I only had enough money for papers
for my wife and daughter,

333
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:10,742
so when they left,

334
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:12,488
Greta wanted me to keep it.

335
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:16,368
With the promise that I would
bring it back to her soon.

336
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:19,459
So,

337
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:22,040
torture me all you want, <i>Fräulein.</i>

338
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:26,131
I swear I will never give up
my secret

339
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:28,209
until I am with my family.

340
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:37,851
This was supposed to be
a simple in and out.

341
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,053
Now we're stuck here in this dump.

342
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,606
Damn it!

343
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:43,940
My father still thinks
I'm a little kid.

344
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:47,732
Now he's going to lord it over me
that he's stronger than me,

345
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:49,529
that we're not equals and that I...

346
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:52,820
That I failed.

347
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,035
It's not all bad.

348
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:58,163
We have extended Dr. Vogel's life
past its normal expiration date.

349
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,582
- What?
- So all we have to do is

350
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,791
just get him across the border,
and then he'll talk.

351
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,920
Right?

352
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,088
Of course.

353
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,462
Why didn't I think of that?

354
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,462
We'll just mosey across

355
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:12,044
the most heavily guarded border
in all of history.

356
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:13,263
Yeah.

357
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,388
- Is that sarcasm?
- No.

358
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,261
No, that's not sarcasm...

359
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:18,679
Yes, it's sarcasm!

360
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,514
Look, it's not going to work.

361
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:22,646
Without magic, it's impossible.

362
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:23,809
Nothing's impossible.

363
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:26,775
We thought cold fusion
was impossible.

364
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:28,477
So you don't have magic.

365
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:31,359
Young Darhk is no match
for our brains and determination.

366
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,197
You know what?

367
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:36,410
It's high time you showed your dad
what's really inside you.

368
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,079
Besides a demon.

369
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:46,503
Dr. Vogel, where does one go
to acquire forged papers?

370
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:54,716
Looks like our master forger's
changed occupations.

371
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,505
This was the address I was given.

372
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:59,303
Perhaps we should come back
during the day.

373
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,497
You really think
we'll live to see morning

374
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:02,853
with you-know-who on our tail?

375
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:03,980
Wait.

376
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,311
Don't judge a storefront by its hats.

377
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,497
Let's get to work.

378
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,003
First, documents must be flawless.

379
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,584
Then, we need
the right set of wheels.

380
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:38,927
<i>Only diplomatic vehicles are the ones
to be waved across the checkpoint.</i>

381
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:47,598
You look like yummy morsel, <i>Fräulein.</i>

382
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:49,729
And how much for a little taste?

383
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:54,573
How about your car?

384
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:55,657
And last but not least,

385
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:58,446
the most important part
of any time travel mission,

386
00:17:58,911 --> 00:17:59,911
disguises.

387
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,717
<i>The Legends never go anywhere
without them.</i>

388
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:06,367
Thank you so much, and again,
sorry for ruining your night.

389
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,539
They should've been back an hour ago.

390
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:11,998
Was I not clear when I said,
"Come right back, no dawdling"?

391
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,048
I think I was crystal clear
on that point.

392
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:16,965
You know, maybe you're right.

393
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:19,213
Maybe she is testing me.

394
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:22,136
Pushing her curfew
to see how I react.

395
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,138
Am I being paranoid?

396
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,104
Maybe you're right.

397
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:27,934
Maybe I'm not being paranoid enough.

398
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:30,273
Maybe she needs me
to be more involved.

399
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:32,087
I mean, for her,
I've been gone for 20 years.

400
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,649
Oh, think of everything
that I've missed.

401
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,948
Life was so much simpler
before fatherhood.

402
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:39,533
So much anxiety.

403
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,404
You know, you're right, Alan.

404
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:42,653
I need to take action,

405
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,454
not wallow in doubt.

406
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,207
I'm going after them.

407
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,158
Thanks, pal.
Great chat.

408
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,186
Don't worry, Nora.

409
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:10,063
Daddy's coming.

410
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,699
Remember our story.

411
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,201
Yeah. Uh...

412
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:31,126
Now is probably not the right time
to mention that I am a terrible liar.

413
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:35,039
Try and imagine my surprise.

414
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:41,763
Papers.

415
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:55,684
What were you doing in East Berlin?

416
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:59,230
We were at the opera.

417
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,148
For the whole night?

418
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:05,782
Opera was a very long show.

419
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:08,698
Big show, good show.
We have the best shows.

420
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:11,033
Very long, very big, but very...

421
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,771
Is there some problem?

422
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:16,004
I just find it odd you returning
at this hour of the morning.

423
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,789
We made, uh,

424
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,336
a proper night of it.

425
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:22,961
I must run this by my supervisor.

426
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:28,350
Do you know who my husband is?

427
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:30,603
You know what?

428
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,471
Do bring your supervisor over.

429
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:35,148
I want him to know just how idiotic
his underlings are.

430
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:36,934
Excuse me! Sir!

431
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:38,143
Of course...

432
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:39,946
I see it now.

433
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:43,065
I'm sorry, <i>mein Herr,</i>
I did not recognize you in that

434
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:45,285
hat.

435
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:55,168
You, on the other hand,
are a fantastic liar.

436
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:18,100
Oh, no. It's my dad.

437
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:19,755
Yeah, hit man Darhk's
going to kill us.

438
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:21,319
Not that dad, that dad!

439
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,866
Well, he's definitely
going to kill me.

440
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,568
I was supposed
to have you home by now.

441
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:33,156
What the hell are you doing here?

442
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:34,370
Saving you, Nora doll.

443
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:36,222
And is that any way
to speak to your father?

444
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:39,881
Safety first.

445
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:40,965
Strap in, kids.

446
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:43,468
Floor it.

447
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:57,292
I could've handled myself back there.

448
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,807
I didn't need your help.

449
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:01,814
For the love of Mallus, would you
stop with the hat thing already?

450
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:03,566
Oh. Hi.

451
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,297
Is all of this just a game to you?

452
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:08,282
Because I feel like I'm the only one
taking any of this seriously.

453
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:10,156
Well, since my time stone
still works,

454
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:11,908
we're going to do things my way.

455
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:14,114
We're going to bring the good doctor
back to 2018

456
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,699
and torture him until he talks.

457
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:17,250
Torture isn't the answer.

458
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,336
Says who?

459
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,181
He knows his secret is the only way
he'll ever see his daughter again.

460
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:22,484
Because unlike some fathers,

461
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:24,249
he values his family
more than himself.

462
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,460
I just saved your life
back there, what...

463
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:31,844
- Honey bunny, listen. Look at me.
- Oh.

464
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:35,177
Don't you know that I've only ever
had your best interests at heart?

465
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:37,183
Was it in my best interest or yours

466
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:39,668
when you pushed a scared little girl
into the arms of a demon?

467
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:41,149
Yeah, to bring us back together.

468
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:42,567
To bring you back to life!

469
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:44,027
What has gotten into you?

470
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:46,981
I send you off on one lousy mission
by yourself, and suddenly, the...

471
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:51,155
Oh... Of course.

472
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:55,455
I should've known Ray Palmer
would be a good influence on you.

473
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:57,449
Perhaps I should
give you two some privacy...

474
00:22:58,961 --> 00:22:59,961
You know what?

475
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,169
I thought I raised my father
from the dead,

476
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:04,881
but instead I see
I just got a selfish man-child.

477
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:06,174
"Man-child"?

478
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:08,259
Why don't you run along
to your little hellscape

479
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:09,927
and boo-hoo to Mallus?

480
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,700
'Cause now that
you're a demon's mouthpiece,

481
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:13,636
it's obvious you don't need me.

482
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:16,093
Nora, I...

483
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:18,762
- Nora.
- Leave me alone, Dad.

484
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:21,140
No, that's good.
Just keep talking.

485
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:30,068
So, Ray's nowhere to be found

486
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,866
and things are getting worse
at the Bureau.

487
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:34,285
Bennett is so stubborn,
he's refusing any meetings with Rip

488
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:35,657
that don't involve shackles.

489
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:38,622
I'm so sorry. Here I am,

490
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:40,979
babbling about Bureau politics,
and your friend's in trouble.

491
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:42,003
How are you holding up?

492
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:44,955
Mutilating photos of your nemesis.

493
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:46,174
Got it.

494
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,428
Well, at least our nonverbal
communication skills

495
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:49,469
are off to a good start.

496
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:51,215
Everything that we're doing
to find Ray,

497
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:52,466
it's turning up empty.

498
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:54,513
Hey, you're going to get Ray back.

499
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,600
Promise.

500
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:57,930
Can we have a little bit more of some

501
00:23:58,187 --> 00:24:00,600
nonverbal communication?

502
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,326
I thought you said
this place was beautiful.

503
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,036
Yeah. It was.

504
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:28,877
Something's wrong.

505
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,159
You shouldn't be
walking around alone.

506
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:37,183
Stop treating...

507
00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:40,353
You.

508
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:42,395
Expecting someone else?

509
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:47,150
You know, the last time I saw Nora,
she was still Daddy's little girl.

510
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:49,022
Before you know it,

511
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:52,321
20 years passes just like that.

512
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:55,539
And sure, we're traveling
through time together,

513
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:57,611
plotting the end of the world, but...

514
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:01,365
I'm left wondering,
"Where is that little girl

515
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:03,074
"and how do I get her back?"

516
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:06,203
Look, I'm not keeping you alive
for my health.

517
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:07,962
Speak.

518
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:09,957
Oh.

519
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,633
If you really care
that much about Nora,

520
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:18,986
then maybe you shouldn't let her
be a conduit for a primordial evil.

521
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:21,601
I admit, this isn't the life
that I wanted for her, but...

522
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:24,725
World domination was
supposed to be my gift to her,

523
00:25:24,815 --> 00:25:26,101
not her career path.

524
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:28,020
Then maybe you should tell her
how you feel.

525
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,147
She's under a lot of pressure,
you know.

526
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:31,523
And it's all to impress you.

527
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:32,655
Me?

528
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,530
I'm so proud of Nora.

529
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:35,948
Obviously, she knows that.

530
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:38,405
She only knows
what you say to her, Damien.

531
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:40,904
Can I call you Damien?

532
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,873
- Yeah.
- I have the girl.

533
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:49,589
<i>Nora.</i>

534
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:51,498
<i>If you hurt her, I swear...</i>

535
00:25:51,592 --> 00:25:54,505
Meet me on the rooftop
of the Schneider Cement building.

536
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,586
An even exchange.

537
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:59,005
Her life for the scientist's.

538
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:06,513
I am going to kick my ass.

539
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:11,859
What is it?
Is it Nora, is she okay?

540
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:12,945
She's alive.

541
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,362
His life for hers.

542
00:26:14,448 --> 00:26:15,814
He wants to meet in one hour.

543
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,219
I should've just listened.
This is all my fault.

544
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,243
If I lose her...

545
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:21,181
Look, it seems like you're
having trouble with the knot.

546
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:22,696
- I am.
- Okay, well, you're probably

547
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,059
slipping the slack
through the half-hitch.

548
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,083
How do you know that?

549
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:26,703
Because I am an Eagle Scout,
trust me.

550
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:28,584
Look, I fought you lots of times.

551
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:31,542
Together, we can save Nora,
just give me back my suit.

552
00:26:31,632 --> 00:26:33,919
Oh, sure, and after we save my daughter,

553
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:36,049
maybe we can go shoot some hoops
and grab a brewski.

554
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:38,423
Now that's a good knot.

555
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:41,422
One therapy session
does not make us friends.

556
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:43,845
You are still going to die
when I'm done with you.

557
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:44,936
You.

558
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:53,435
There's no reason
why we can't collaborate.

559
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:55,020
We'll take the doctor for a few days

560
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:56,821
and give him back
when we're done with him.

561
00:26:57,157 --> 00:27:00,400
You don't want to talk
about your plan even a little bit?

562
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:03,824
Well, the plan is simple.

563
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:06,165
I'm going to kill you.

564
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:12,236
Hey, you know, I think we should go.

565
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:13,879
No. Not yet.

566
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:17,383
It's like I can feel my totem
everywhere in here,

567
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,176
but it feels different.

568
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:26,760
You're still here.

569
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:30,392
What happened to this place?

570
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:34,185
The longer your totem
is in the possession of darkness,

571
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,318
the more it is corrupted.

572
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:40,527
I am fighting it
but I cannot resist forever.

573
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,825
I'll get my totem back.
I promise.

574
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:45,449
You must get Kuasa back as well.

575
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:46,822
She needs you.

576
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:49,415
And soon, you will need her.

577
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,501
What for?

578
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:54,754
The first totem bearers
imprisoned a great evil,

579
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:56,581
and if he breaks free...

580
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:57,675
You mean Mallus?

581
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:02,588
Do not say his name here.

582
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:04,468
He cannot enter your world.

583
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:07,884
But this is the world between worlds.

584
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:10,557
Time does not exist here.

585
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:12,813
And time is his cage.

586
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:15,316
And the further time is broken,

587
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:18,611
the closer the demon comes
to breaking free.

588
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,488
This is why Darhk and his allies
are creating anachronisms.

589
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,191
And if you do not stop them,

590
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:27,617
all of time is at risk.

591
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,880
Nora!

592
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:37,506
If you hurt her...

593
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:39,423
<i>I want to see the scientist.</i>

594
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:45,679
Now give me back my daughter,
you cocky little bastard.

595
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:51,479
Nora!

596
00:29:02,616 --> 00:29:04,482
I got you.
I won't let you fall.

597
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:06,484
This is why I'll never have kids.

598
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:07,989
They make you weak.

599
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:17,036
Huh? Magic.

600
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:18,879
I should look into that.

601
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,008
I got you.

602
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,391
Activate suit.

603
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:41,853
Activate suit.

604
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,033
<i>Voice authentication denied.</i>

605
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,440
Dad.

606
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:26,657
Okay.

607
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:28,734
Suit, fire atom-blaster.

608
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:31,122
<i>Dr. Palmer, voice authenticated.</i>

609
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:42,755
Okay, reduce atom-blaster power
by 99%.

610
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:45,676
Target,

611
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:48,010
45 degrees to the left.

612
00:30:48,138 --> 00:30:49,504
Ten degrees down.

613
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:52,181
Make it 10.1 degrees.

614
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:54,676
And...

615
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:56,354
Fire.

616
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:01,317
Nora.

617
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:06,197
Dad.

618
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:08,193
You have to let me go.

619
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:09,941
No, I won't.

620
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,484
If you don't, you'll die.

621
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:13,788
No.

622
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:15,655
I can't lose you.

623
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:16,957
Not again.

624
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,367
I'll be okay.

625
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:22,912
I love you.

626
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:30,385
Why won't you die?

627
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,313
Because I have something to live for.

628
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:55,862
The totem, it's turned.

629
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:59,415
She has claimed its power.

630
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:01,743
- Okay, we need to get out of here.
- No.

631
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:04,079
You must leave, my children.

632
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,172
Run.

633
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,965
Looks like you still got it, old man.

634
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:13,262
Who you calling "old man"?

635
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,177
I look good for 257.

636
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:25,795
I've always wanted to do that.

637
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:26,819
Nice one, honey.

638
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:28,623
We got them.

639
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:38,662
Dr. Vogel, you okay?

640
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:39,871
A <i>Roboter</i> man?

641
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,241
No, no, it's me.

642
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:43,479
- Look, we got to get you out of here.
- I can't make it.

643
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:44,744
It's too late for me.

644
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,746
Here. Take this.

645
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:49,044
No. No, you're going to get it back
to Greta yourself.

646
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:52,213
The doll was never hers.

647
00:32:55,265 --> 00:32:57,803
Everything you need to know
about cold fusion.

648
00:32:58,477 --> 00:32:59,593
It's all in there.

649
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,417
I'm not going to leave you here.

650
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:05,477
Your family needs you.

651
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:07,183
And the planet
needs your brilliant mind.

652
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,822
No!

653
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:18,782
Well, I wasn't going to let him
ruin my perfect record.

654
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:22,324
Excuse me.

655
00:33:34,054 --> 00:33:36,137
Where do you think you're going
with that doll, Ray?

656
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:38,506
I promised Vogel
I'd get this back to his daughter.

657
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,661
If I've learned one thing
from all of this,

658
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:42,176
it's that you're a terrible liar.

659
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,061
Give me the doll.

660
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:47,102
Sorry, Nora.

661
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:48,526
Can't do that.

662
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:54,397
Come on, you and I both know
you're not going to shoot me.

663
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:02,957
You're right.

664
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:05,709
What was that?

665
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:08,377
It's a Timequake.
Gideon, what's the source?

666
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:10,963
<i>An aberration
has occurred in 1962.</i>

667
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:14,008
<i>It appears that someone has
blasted a hole in the Berlin Wall.</i>

668
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:15,511
Ray.

669
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:18,588
Which appears to be the straw
that broke the camel's back.

670
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:22,971
I'm guessing that's bad.

671
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:24,514
Aye.

672
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:28,014
Yeah. Those are tears
in the fabric of time itself.

673
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:31,351
Gideon, plot a course
for East Berlin, 1962.

674
00:34:31,653 --> 00:34:32,769
All right, kid.

675
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:34,405
You're up.

676
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:36,864
Let's see how fast you really are.

677
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:51,579
Okay, you're going to want
to hold on.

678
00:34:51,965 --> 00:34:52,965
See you.

679
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:55,509
Speedsters.

680
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:57,426
I hate speedsters.

681
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:01,388
Almost as much as I hate that guy.

682
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,181
Look who I bumped into.

683
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:11,933
- Hey!
- Buddy.

684
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:14,647
Ray, thank God you're back.

685
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:16,650
Yeah. Dishes need cleaning.

686
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:18,523
And I can't wait to get them done.

687
00:35:18,742 --> 00:35:20,233
Rip, nice to see...

688
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:21,905
Wait, is it nice to see Rip?

689
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,906
- Eh...
- Yeah. Yeah.

690
00:35:23,997 --> 00:35:25,158
Okay.

691
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:26,642
I hope that your abduction
afforded you

692
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,532
some insights
into our opponent's designs.

693
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:31,077
Yes, they needed me
to reignite the Fire Totem

694
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:32,171
using this.

695
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:34,247
Another doll.
How wonderful.

696
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:36,146
Well, no, actually, it's...

697
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:40,758
- Oh, gee.
- It's the secret to cold fusion.

698
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:43,139
Which is pretty epic.

699
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:45,808
Now, all we're missing
is the Fire Totem.

700
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:47,635
Oh, you mean this?

701
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:51,017
Yeah. How did you get this?

702
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:52,877
I saw it in Damien Darhk's pocket
and I thought,

703
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:55,109
Yo, that would make a sick "souvenir."

704
00:35:55,195 --> 00:35:56,686
- What?
- Well, great.

705
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,799
I can get to work putting this
back together right now,

706
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,439
then it will be three against two.

707
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:03,151
And, with yours,
it'll be four to one.

708
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:04,597
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

709
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:05,862
Hey. Welcome back.

710
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,517
We found out that my totem
has been corrupted

711
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:09,873
when we were on our vision quest.

712
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:14,045
But we did find out why the Darhks
are so psyched about anachronisms.

713
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:16,004
The more the timeline is corrupted,

714
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:18,083
the weaker the prison
holding Mallus becomes.

715
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:21,506
If they continue destroying history,
the demon will be freed.

716
00:36:22,055 --> 00:36:24,547
You should inform the Time Bureau

717
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:26,058
immediately.

718
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:28,350
Gideon, patch us through
to Director Bennett please.

719
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:30,344
<i>Make it fast, Agent Sharpe,</i>

720
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:32,145
<i>because I've got to stop
Alexander Hamilton</i>

721
00:36:32,232 --> 00:36:34,394
<i>from seeing</i> Hamilton, <i>the musical.</i>

722
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:36,587
How's it possible that everyone
got tickets to that but me?

723
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,172
Director Bennett,
we have some developments

724
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:40,436
in the Mallus investigation
that you need to be aware of.

725
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:42,740
<i>Such as your arresting
Director Hunter?</i>

726
00:36:42,826 --> 00:36:46,194
I, uh, haven't arrested him exactly yet.

727
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:48,738
Look, we got bigger problems
right now

728
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:51,115
than punishing Rip for what happened
to those agents.

729
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:54,744
<i>I doubt those deceased agents
would agree with you, Miss Lance.</i>

730
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:57,797
<i>Now, you place Hunter
in handcuffs this instant,</i>

731
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,043
<i>or you're all going...</i>

732
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:14,813
- Oh, my God.
- It's "Grodd," actually.

733
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:18,351
Ava, I'm so sorry.
He was a good man, I think.

734
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:20,815
Yes, most unfortunate.

735
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:23,147
I believe that this tragedy makes you

736
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,198
the highest ranking official
at the Bureau.

737
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,653
May I return to work,

738
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:32,448
Director Sharpe?

739
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:35,079
Um...

740
00:37:35,712 --> 00:37:36,712
Yes.

741
00:37:39,716 --> 00:37:41,332
Thank you
for searching all of history

742
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:43,088
to save me
from a demented super villain.

743
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:45,211
Two demented super villains.

744
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:47,508
Are you forgetting
the apple of Damien Darhk's eye?

745
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:50,220
She's had a tough life.

746
00:37:50,477 --> 00:37:52,264
She may come off all mean
and witchy, but...

747
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:54,937
Underneath all that,
she's a real person.

748
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:56,523
Wait.

749
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,436
Do you have the hots for Nora Darhk?

750
00:37:58,902 --> 00:38:02,691
What? No. No. No?

751
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:04,864
Look, I'm not blind, she's hot,

752
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:08,575
but she's also bonkers.
Which is kind of hot.

753
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:10,410
I just think that,

754
00:38:11,331 --> 00:38:13,163
you know, maybe there's hope for her.

755
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:15,207
You would, you big softie.

756
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:18,247
Well, you're a delicate flower,
Raymond Palmer.

757
00:38:19,756 --> 00:38:21,167
Take care of that heart of yours.

758
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:25,210
Wally, hey.

759
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,261
I just wanted to say,
good job out there.

760
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:29,846
Are you sticking around?

761
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:33,768
Um... No, I might join Rip
at the Time Bureau instead.

762
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:35,187
Hmm. Right.

763
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:36,749
Yeah, I mean, I get that if you

764
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:38,605
want to go hang out
with a bunch of stiffs

765
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:40,182
instead of the cool kids, but, yeah.

766
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:42,359
Well, I'm kind of getting
like a weird vibe here.

767
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:45,062
I feel like Mick and Zari
both hate me already,

768
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:47,523
and the others are probably
not that far behind, so...

769
00:38:47,617 --> 00:38:49,358
So what?
I mean, when Nate first arrived,

770
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:50,846
he threw Ray into the temporal zone,

771
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,031
Amaya beat everybody up,

772
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:54,078
Zari tricked us
into pulling off a heist,

773
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:57,374
and Mick, well, he's betrayed us
at least 10 times.

774
00:38:58,086 --> 00:38:59,748
I mean, we're kind of like

775
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:02,831
the all-stars
of bad first impressions, so...

776
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:05,169
I think you'd fit in great.

777
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:07,671
Wally, there you are.

778
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:09,753
- Ready to leave?
- Um...

779
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:14,050
I'm actually going to stay.

780
00:39:14,561 --> 00:39:16,052
I was hoping you would.

781
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:20,181
Well, I wish we could stay longer,

782
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:22,562
but my boss was
just murdered by a gorilla,

783
00:39:22,652 --> 00:39:25,315
not to mention the mess in Berlin
that needs fixing.

784
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,817
Well, call me.

785
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:30,399
Until next time, Captain Lance.

786
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:32,986
Until next time, Agent Hunter.

787
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:35,196
Director Sharpe.

788
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:38,876
So,

789
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,080
you and Miss Lance.

790
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:44,667
I think there's something real there.

791
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:46,840
Yeah, she's special.

792
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,545
And so are you.

793
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:55,515
Gideon, delete file 354-Z.

794
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,183
Sara can never find out the truth
about Ava.

795
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:01,977
<i>Yes, Director Hunter.</i>

796
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:15,752
Thought you were
getting a breath of fresh air.

797
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:19,039
Well, I felt like an apology
was in order.

798
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:22,288
I lost the Fire Totem.

799
00:40:23,004 --> 00:40:24,540
And I know how much it meant to you,

800
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:26,755
and to the big guy, Mallus.

801
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:31,419
But I also remember something that
used to bring a smile to your face.

802
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:36,181
Hot chocolate with whipped cream
and caramel sauce.

803
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:39,476
Oh. Wow, I haven't had
one of these since...

804
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:41,724
Since I came and told you
to join the order.

805
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,358
Since I sent you
into the arms of a demon.

806
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:49,982
I'm glad you did.

807
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,322
It brought us back together.

808
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:53,408
No.

809
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:56,110
I never should've
doubted your strength.

810
00:40:57,914 --> 00:41:00,622
And I know you feel a lot of pressure
to be like your old man,

811
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:02,578
but I just want you to know that...

812
00:41:05,213 --> 00:41:06,420
I'm proud of you.

813
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:08,748
No matter what.

814
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,900
I think there's something
in my eye there.

815
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:16,575
I think I saw some brandy
back there for our hot chocolates.

816
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:17,760
Let me go get some.

817
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:48,707
Everything okay, Nora doll?

818
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:55,719
I'm fine, Daddy.
