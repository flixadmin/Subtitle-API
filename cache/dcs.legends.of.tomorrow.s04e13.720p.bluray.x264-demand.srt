<i>Neron must be
looking for a new vessel.</i>

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,400
Nora!

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,790
Nora?

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,236
I don't like Nate.
That would be wrong and...

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,596
- Nate likes you.
<i>- Why don't you talk to Nate?</i>

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,955
<i>Tell him how you feel.</i>

<i>Mick's writing

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,437
- Rebecca Silver?
- Nom-de-plume.

10
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,976
Nearly cost her her life.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,400
She killed that bloody demon.

12
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,712
You're letting the cold in, man.

13
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,154
We found something, sir.

14
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,036
But it's hard to explain.

15
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,396
Don't stand there like a fool.
Spit it out.

16
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,710
Something was encased in the ice.
It appears to be...

17
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,870
Gold.

18
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,829
Careful, sir.

19
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,718
It's... incredible.

20
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,517
I haven't the foggiest what it is.

21
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,159
I know exactly what it is.

22
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,993
My greatest discovery.

23
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,271
Yeah. That's what they all say.

24
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,997
Oh, hey, ladies. Was he any trouble?

25
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,030
Slam dunk. Honestly, with Neron gone,

26
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,918
catching fugitives
has never been easier.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,136
I thought it was gonna take all week.

28
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,616
That's great. It means you won't
have to miss book club tonight.

29
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,678
- That's right. Book club.
- Mmm-hmm.

30
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,480
Whoa! Smells like
somebody hasn't showered

31
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,914
since birds were letters.

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,753
That's a hieroglyphics joke.

33
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,270
Ha! Nice.

34
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,315
Oh, buddy, don't talk
with your mouth full, am I right?

35
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,912
Mummies are the biggest dummies.
Hey, you big dummy mummy.

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,071
Got your containment cell all set up,

37
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:54,471
and we upgraded you
to a king-size sarcophagus.

38
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,517
Oh, and would you like a wake-up call

39
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,800
from the front desk in,
I don't know, about 1,000 years?

40
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,559
Nice.

41
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,439
All right, cool.

42
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,680
- Bye.
- Bye.

43
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,600
I mean, what the hell was that?

44
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,069
- On it.
- Yeah.

45
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,556
Z, how's it going?

46
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,154
It's going super awesome.

47
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,240
How are you and Nate?

48
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,155
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

49
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,040
Ah!

50
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:33,435
Nate dawg... It's going totally great,
in a super platonic way.

51
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,400
Then why are you guys being so weird?

52
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,039
It was that awkward, huh?

53
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,640
Even the mummy thought it was awkward.

54
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,719
Look, I mean, you like him, right?

55
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,555
Yeah, I think so. But I don't know
what the next step would be.

56
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,917
Oh, that's easy.
You just jump his bones.

57
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,960
What if I do that
and it screws up our friendship?

58
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,556
Look, Z.

59
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,477
Sometimes, for the good
of the relationship,

60
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,200
you have to put yourself outside
of your comfort zone.

61
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,030
For instance,

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,076
I am going to read 500 pages of some
trashy novel by tonight, for Ava.

63
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,749
And look, with Neron gone,

64
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,560
now is the time for us
to get our personal lives into order.

65
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,716
I will help you.

66
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,029
Please don't.

67
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,837
Relationship expert.

68
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,240
<i>"I showed him my locket,</i>

69
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:25,792
explaining, 'I keep the ones I love
in here, close to my heart.'

70
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:30,113
Gustavo replied, 'I keep the ones
I love in my freezer,

71
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,157
close to my microwave.'

72
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,472
He had a devilish sense of humor
that I found irresistible."

73
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,915
Hey, Ray!

74
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,992
I was just reading our book club book
to Nora.

75
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,719
Oh, that's really nice, Mona.

76
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,835
Ray, are you okay?
You look like you haven't slept in days.

77
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,832
Oh... Been having weird dreams.

78
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,718
- How is she?
- No improvements.

79
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,632
But no setbacks.

80
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,040
Any news from Constantine?

81
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,156
Nothing yet.

82
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,120
Well, I'm sure he'll find a way
to bring her back.

83
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,600
I'll leave you two alone.

84
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,280
I brought you some more flowers

85
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,438
because when you do wake up,

86
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:10,275
I want you to know that your life
is going to be beautiful from now on.

87
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,195
What the hell?

88
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,315
What's happening?

89
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,636
Wait. What are you doing
with the pillow?

90
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,360
Are you smothering her?
You're smothering her?

91
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,355
Not groovy.

92
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,278
Not groovy at all.

93
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,273
What's happening?

94
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,032
What are you doing?
Why did you try to smother Nora?

95
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,830
Are you losing it, Ray?

96
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,276
Oh, I don't think you're crazy, Ray.

97
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,995
Let's chat.

98
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,675
Just Ray and Neron.

99
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,435
Neron?

100
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,678
No, you're dead.

101
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,157
You're dead. This isn't real.
This isn't real.

102
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,390
Not real?

103
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,920
This is all in my head.
This is all in my head, okay?

104
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,195
Ray!

105
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,673
Wow, this place is a mess.

106
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,797
Uh... Hey, um...

107
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,520
Containment-level bathroom
is sort of my crying spot...

108
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,796
- Not now, Gary!
- Okay, okay.

109
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,797
You're a reasonable man, Ray Palmer.

110
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,554
So I'm going to make you
a reasonable offer.

111
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,793
Give yourself to me freely.

112
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,994
No. No, this conversation is over.

113
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,831
You leave me no choice
but to make you kill someone you love.

114
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,355
You made me try to kill Nora.

115
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,270
But why?

116
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,593
Because, if you murder someone you love,
your soul will be mine.

117
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,477
What is happening?

118
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,200
Mick, fancy a brew?

119
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,430
Laundry.

120
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,113
Sorry! Sorry.
I'll be in the science, doing lab.

121
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,032
Nobody bother me, or my hand.

122
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,395
Haircut!

123
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,080
What's all this ruckus?

124
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,760
- Hey!
- Hey, I got it!

125
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,719
- Is this fan mail for Rebecca Silver?
- No.

126
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,111
It is not. Here. Give me that!

127
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,193
An invitation for Rebecca Silver
to reveal her identity

128
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,239
at RomantiCon 2019 for $20,000.

129
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,073
Rebecca doesn't do cons.

130
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,976
Now, Mick, I realize
that you don't like people knowing

131
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,856
that you moonlight
as a romance novelist, but...

132
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,656
Do I like look like a romance novelist
to you?

133
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,478
Oi, listen, don't you get mad at me.

134
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,880
Now, this is an easy score,
and we're gonna get that money.

135
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,714
20K. How?

136
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,360
Well, I'll be Rebecca, mate.

137
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,714
Okay. Page one...

138
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,680
...will have to wait.

139
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,913
All right, people, we've got a hit.

140
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,314
New York City, 1933.
The Adventurers Society.

141
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,595
Shut the front door!

142
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,000
What's the Adventurers Society?

143
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,879
It's a club
for archaeologists and explorers.

144
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,156
It's basically the coolest place
in history.

145
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,754
Guys, this is gonna be awesome!

146
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,400
Nate, you're running point on this one.

147
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,280
With Zari.

148
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,876
- For real?
- For real?

149
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,960
Um...

150
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,589
Sara, we did not discuss this.

151
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,559
Look, relax. It's just a cleanup job.
We'll do fine.

152
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,080
Okay.

153
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,595
Find the fugitive,
bring him in, preferably in one piece.

154
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,476
Now scram.

155
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,040
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

156
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,835
You're willing to risk an entire mission
to play matchmaker?

157
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,920
I sure am.

158
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,976
Honestly, I'm getting
a "just friends" vibe.

159
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,993
I bet you 20 bucks
they hook up on the mission.

160
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,230
I'll take that.

161
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,080
You and I running this mission
won't be weird at all.

162
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,959
- Yeah, it's gonna be super chill.
- Yeah.

163
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:38,156
And just because Sara and Ava are busy
doesn't mean everybody else is.

164
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,280
Yes. Let's rally the troops.

165
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,589
Yes.

166
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,599
Raymond, we've got a legit
Time Bros mission.

167
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,150
What? Time... Time Bros, that's us.

168
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,910
Um... Look, I just...

169
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,754
I've got some stuff I'm doing here.

170
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,275
Come on, put the "schmience" away.
We got a magic blip.

171
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,149
Look, right now, it's just me and Zari,
and if I'm being totally honest,

172
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,799
it's a little awkward between us.

173
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,553
So I could really use my wing man.

174
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,600
I'm just doing
some interesting stuff here. I...

175
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,678
It's something that has to do with me.

176
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,630
Busy working on a vaccine for...
N...

177
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,720
For what?

178
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,990
Are you all right?

179
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,157
- I got it.
- You do?

180
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,515
This is about Nora.

181
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,680
I'm sitting here, going on and on
about me and Zari,

182
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,080
I'm not even thinking about
what you must be going through.

183
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,709
I am sorry for being a bad friend.
Bring it in.

184
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,311
What kind of punk-ass hug is that?

185
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,719
Bring it all the way in, Raymond.

186
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,800
Hug me.

187
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,872
Look, whatever you're working on,

188
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,275
you're gonna kill it.

189
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,077
You're gonna absolutely murder it.

190
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,160
- Ah, Ray?
- Yeah, I just sort of

191
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,496
sometimes like
to do a pre-mission massage, you know?

192
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,115
Just to limber up before we get out
in the field.

193
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,112
- A little too much?
- Yeah.

194
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,032
Well, say hello to Rebecca Silver.

195
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,354
Try these.

196
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,990
Perfect.

197
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,196
Nice get-up.

198
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,638
So you guys heard we're headed
to the '30s?

199
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,720
No.

200
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,871
Well, you are.
Sara put me and Nate in charge.

201
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,994
Oh, are you and Nate finally gonna...

202
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,310
Boom, boom.

203
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,073
Stop, stop. Okay.

204
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,669
Guess what. You're on the <i>Waverider,</i>
so you're going.

205
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,399
<i>Jumpship's</i> got
a full tank though, yeah?

206
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,040
Do you have somewhere to be?

207
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,096
Best if you don't pry, love.
Just like I'm not asking

208
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,720
about that naughty little number
Sara left behind for you to wear.

209
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,435
Check your closet.

210
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,200
- Rory, do you want to...
- Plans.

211
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,440
Okay.

212
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,231
I can't believe
everyone else bailed on the mission.

213
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,354
More Adventurers Society for us.

214
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,233
All right. Let's do this.

215
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,079
- Allow me.
- Thank you.

216
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,038
I know. I know. These costumes
are totally ridiculous.

217
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,113
You look absolutely, um...

218
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,600
yeah, ridiculous.

219
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,636
Uh, apparently, it's all part
of the cover story Sara gave me.

220
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,515
I'm someone named Marion Ravenwood.

221
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,640
Wait.

222
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,760
Wait a second.

223
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:54,074
Huh. Well, it says here
I am Dr. Henry Jones Jr.

224
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,393
Professor of archaeology,
expert in the occult.

225
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,960
And how does one say this?

226
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,600
Obtainer of rare antiquities.

227
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,080
How...

228
00:12:03,081 --> 00:12:04,401
It's Indiana Jones.

229
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,680
Yeah.

230
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,233
- Sara set us up.
- What's that?

231
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,597
Adventurers Society, everyone else
unavailable for the mission,

232
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,911
dressing up like your favorite movie,

233
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,710
it's all a setup
to send us on the perfect date.

234
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,993
I totally get
if you want to go back to the ship.

235
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:29,279
Or we can see where
this mission takes us.

236
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,710
Oh, Mick, we're gonna make
a killing off of these people.

237
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:52,240
Does Rebecca Silver belong
in sci-fi erotica or cyber-erotica?

238
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,880
Rebecca Silver defies all categories.

239
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,040
Excuse me. You are?

240
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,793
It's me
you should be talking to, actually.

241
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,240
I am Rebecca Silver.

242
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,441
And I do not appreciate the tone
that you're taking with my bodyguard.

243
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:07,079
Oh, goodness, Ms. Silver.
The Recluse of Romance.

244
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,197
We are honored that you will be making

245
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,875
your first public appearance ever
with us.

246
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,475
You look exactly as I dreamed.

247
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,080
I'm just here for the check, really.

248
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,118
Of course. And you will get it

249
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,510
after your public appearance,
Q&A, and book signing.

250
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,432
Oh, chitchat with a bunch of weirdos

251
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,736
dressed as some ridiculous alien queen
they want to bang.

252
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:26,721
No problem.

253
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,870
Number one, Garima is a warrior.

254
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,350
- Number two, you're being rude.
- Rude?

255
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,319
That's rich coming from you.
You're the rudest person I know.

256
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,869
You don't get it. You need training.

257
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,720
What time's the Q&A?

258
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,509
In two hours.

259
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,800
Good. We'll be there.

260
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,310
Let's do this.

261
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,392
Okay. Page one.

262
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,160
Is this on audio book?

263
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,376
<i>They say your life flashes</i>

264
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,675
<i>before your eyes when you die.</i>

265
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,989
<i>But what if, in that moment,</i>

266
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,033
<i>you finally see everything
life's been trying to show you?</i>

267
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,670
<i>That's how I discovered
that a killer was amongst me.</i>

268
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,056
<i>I should have
known something was amiss that night.</i>

269
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,216
<i>I was returning from hot yoga
to my sensational cliffside home,</i>

270
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,536
<i>matcha green tea smoothie in hand,</i>

271
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,976
<i>when I noticed my door
was slightly ajar.</i>

272
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,096
<i>I entered, wondering if my dog walker</i>

273
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,376
<i>or cat sitter or personal shopper</i>

274
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,576
<i>or astrologer had failed to close it.</i>

275
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,696
<i>That's when I heard him say,</i>

276
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,235
<i>"There's something
I've been meaning to kill you."</i>

277
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,439
Ladies and gentlemen.
Ladies and gentlemen, please.

278
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,714
My esteemed colleagues,
the honor of having my flag retired

279
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:49,751
is only rivaled by the honor
of sharing my latest discovery.

280
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:56,233
To retrieve it required not only besting
the frozen wasteland of the Arctic,

281
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,758
but also the physical limitations
of the human body itself.

282
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,634
But for the sake of exploration,
I prevailed.

283
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,076
And so, without further ado,

284
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:15,475
I present to you
Gordon Gilchrist's golden mystery...

285
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,600
egg.

286
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,600
Now, Vincent.

287
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,280
In the words of Ray and Mike Tyson,

288
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,716
"I think we found our Myth-tery man."

289
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,755
Come on, science.

290
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,110
Something's happening.

291
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,310
I can feel my hand again.

292
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,074
No, no, no.

293
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,160
The infection...

294
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,750
is spreading.

295
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,758
Gideon, where in the timeline
is John Constantine?

296
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:00,038
His last known whereabouts
were in 2019 with Gary Green.

297
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,713
Would you like me to connect?

298
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:06,756
- What are you doing to me Doctor...
- Gideon? Gideon?

299
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,840
What?

300
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,476
We can't have anyone spying on us now,
can we, Raymond?

301
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,113
You're all alone now.

302
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,432
Well, it's you and me.

303
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,556
Oh, yeah?

304
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,471
Well, I'll just do this
the old-fashioned way.

305
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,550
Aha!

306
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,916
- Hello.
- Gary, hi. Ray Palmer here.

307
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,478
By any chance,
have you spoken to Constantine lately?

308
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,994
Worried about Nora, huh?

309
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,391
What? Yes, but no.
I'm calling on a more personal matter.

310
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,759
Say no more. I will be right over.

311
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,509
What? No! No, no, no, Gary.

312
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,795
No, Gary.

313
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,720
How can I help?

314
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,560
Oh, no.

315
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,280
You hear something?

316
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,757
- There's a guard.
- Okay.

317
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,958
Don't worry. I can talk my way
into anywhere.

318
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,797
Excuse me, my good man. Can you point me
to the nearest facilities?

319
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,349
I have an urgent need to
relieve my bowel.

320
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,880
Let's go.

321
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,433
We are crushing this mission,
by the way.

322
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,989
No classic Legends mishaps,

323
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,470
and only one historically insignificant
nobody received

324
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,233
- blunt force trauma to the head.
- Hmm.

325
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,078
And now we get our prize.

326
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,160
Wait.

327
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,520
Trip wires.

328
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,256
This is going to require one of us
to squeeze through these trip wires,

329
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,910
maneuvering our bodies
in unexpected ways.

330
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,872
Are you asking me to do that?

331
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,719
No. I'm asking you to hold my coat.

332
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:36,794
When I wrote <i>Uncaged Desire,</i>
I was trying to uncage my own desire.

333
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,432
A desire to... To... To...

334
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,936
Oh, bollocks! What's the next bit again?

335
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,271
To feel life, not just live it.

336
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,080
You still don't know Rebecca.

337
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,231
Well, I know you, and you're Rebecca.

338
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,880
Your primary mode of communication
is grunting like a caveman.

339
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,230
Besides, I mean, Rebecca Silver
is whoever we want her to be.

340
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,776
These people,
they don't know anything about her.

341
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,880
What are you talking about?

342
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,949
They read her books.
They read her letters.

343
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,080
Her letters?

344
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,195
Do you answer your fan mail?

345
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,480
I just thought all this
was a big laugh at their expense.

346
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,590
Well, it's not.

347
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,280
Hmm.

348
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,760
Be careful.

349
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,556
What the hell?

350
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,119
It's papier-mâché.

351
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,793
Oh, my God.

352
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,839
She did this all for us.
It's all a setup.

353
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,920
- No.
- Yeah.

354
00:20:07,921 --> 00:20:08,921
- You think?
- Yeah.

355
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,880
It was a fake magicometer alert.
Sara concocted this whole thing.

356
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,838
- I bet you they're actors, too.
- Yeah.

357
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,674
Gordon Gilchrist,
with the ridiculous facial hair.

358
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,036
- The only thing that's missing? Nazis.
- Yeah.

359
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,994
What did you do with the egg, huh?

360
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,233
The real egg.

361
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,756
Oh, she really went all out.

362
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,936
- Hey.
- Well, there you are.

363
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,816
I was beginning to think
you weren't gonna make it.

364
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,911
This is a...
interesting choice of venue.

365
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,071
We can't have book club without Nora.

366
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,470
It takes all three of us
for a book club quorum.

367
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,800
Very sweet.

368
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,394
- Cheers, babe.
- Thank you.

369
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:54,877
All right. So who do you guys think
is the real killer?

370
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,599
Because I have my theories.

371
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,517
Oh, my God. This can't be real.

372
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,759
- I have to go, now.
- What?

373
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,480
You just said that book club requires
all three of you.

374
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,916
It's Rebecca Silver.

375
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,352
She's revealing her identity
at RomantiCon, tonight.

376
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,549
Rebecca Silver?

377
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,599
The sex-positive novelist
reinventing feminism.

378
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,000
Yeah, we know who she is.

379
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,118
Make sure you take lots of pictures.

380
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,312
Oh, my God, thank you.

381
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,675
I can't believe I'm going to be

382
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,837
breathing the same air
as Rebecca Silver.

383
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,038
- Okay, so...
- Hmm.

384
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,274
What did you think of the book?

385
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,313
Oh, you wanna keep doing book club?

386
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,517
Babe, we don't have to.
We can just forget it.

387
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,752
I thought it would be nice for us
to be able to do something of yours.

388
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,314
Aw!

389
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,393
That's so sweet, thank you.

390
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,958
- I didn't read the book.
- What?

391
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,198
- Sorry.
- Seriously?

392
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,352
Honestly, I usually just drink rosé

393
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,877
and let Mona go on and on
and use it as a mini-vacay for my brain.

394
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:01,957
Well, it was actually
a really good book.

395
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,875
Wait, wait. Come on. I can still drink
rosé, and you can go on and on.

396
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,600
- Mmm.
- Come on. Come on.

397
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,756
Okay, fine.

398
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,629
So I think the real killer
was the dog walker.

399
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,800
No.

400
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:18,635
Yes, I mean,
all that pent-up frustration.

401
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,237
She treated him like a doormat.

402
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,151
You can't help me. I need Constantine.

403
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,716
Well, I may not be a master
of the Dark Arts,

404
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,996
but I am an intern of the Dark Arts.

405
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,914
You're interning for Constantine?

406
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,920
Yeah.

407
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,256
He's letting me study his spell books
if I water his plants

408
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,033
while he searches for a cure for Nora.

409
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,880
But, besides, what other options
do you have?

410
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,113
Come on. Tell the Gare-Bear
what ails you.

411
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,270
I don't know how to explain it,

412
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:50,310
but it feels like there's something
inside of me.

413
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,296
Oh, yeah. You know, there's
a beautiful singer inside of me,

414
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,576
but no one's ever going to meet her.

415
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,831
No. No, Gary. No, Gary. This is bad.

416
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,351
This is very bad,
and I don't know how to get it out.

417
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,234
Indigestion. I know just the spell.

418
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,358
I'll have your pipes cleared out
in no time.

419
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,476
Let me just look it up.

420
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,840
Good thing it's not a demon

421
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,997
because, if it was,
you wouldn't be able to tell me.

422
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,993
Weird rule that keeps the victim silent,

423
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,197
all the while trying to
murder a loved one

424
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,749
in order to seal in
the demonic possession forever.

425
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,679
Why did you just stab yourself?

426
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,154
I didn't.

427
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,431
- You're possessed.
- Yes!

428
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,154
I... I... I can help.

429
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,076
Where is the egg?

430
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,754
Take it easy, Hitler Youth.

431
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,832
The egg's broken. It was a crappy prop.

432
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,513
The real egg.

433
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,160
Do not anger me.

434
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,636
Look, this was a good effort,
like really good.

435
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,440
But we've done Nazis before,
but like, real Nazis.

436
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,598
So, if it's okay with you,

437
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,149
I would rather just...
pull the plug on this.

438
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,879
- Yeah.
- My friend here

439
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,753
- is a surgeon.
- Oh, nice.

440
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,317
He will kill you until you tell me
where the real egg is.

441
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,151
- Uh, let's tell Sara we're on to her.
- Yeah.

442
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,993
Mmm.

443
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,912
- Hello.
<i>- Hi, Sara. Nate and Zari here.</i>

444
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,834
<i>Uh, first of all, well-played.</i>

445
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,416
<i>Yeah, setting up this
whole adventure for us to go on a date</i>

446
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,715
<i>was way over-the-top,</i>

447
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,870
<i>but, in the same breath,</i>

448
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,912
very sweet.
And if I were to give a note,

449
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,037
the Nazis were just like a tad too much.

450
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,840
What are you...
What are you talking about?

451
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,310
Are they the same theater troop
as Ava's parents?

452
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,676
- <i>What?</i>
- Sara, drop the act.

453
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,400
Nazis killing us with throwing daggers.
Come on.

454
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,437
Listen to me.

455
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,399
Look, I did purposely put the two of you
on a mission together,

456
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,994
but this is a real mission,

457
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,116
not a game.

458
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,200
<i>Those are real Nazis.</i>

459
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,480
Whoa!

460
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,791
And now, young lady, you die.

461
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,679
- Sorry, Nate.
- For what?

462
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,320
Wow.

463
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,916
- You okay?
- Yeah, that was actually really intense.

464
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,472
See, they took care of things
on their own.

465
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,633
And they were clearly about to hook up.

466
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,096
- No, they weren't. Wait.
- You owe me 20 bucks.

467
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,040
Uh-uh! Uh-uh!

468
00:25:30,041 --> 00:25:31,097
Were you guys about to hook up?

469
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,496
- It was definitely on the table.
- No, no, no, no.

470
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,751
- See. I told you.
- Come on... It doesn't matter.

471
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,256
Okay, now that you know that
it's a real mission, where's the egg?

472
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,760
Yeah, and where is Ray?

473
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,216
Isn't he supposed to be
quarterbacking on this?

474
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,032
Ray? Ray, come in.

475
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,756
Nate, buddy.

476
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,320
Don't come back to the ship
under any circumstances.

477
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,959
- <i>You okay, buddy?</i>
- Yeah.

478
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,311
Just cleaning up a storm over here.

479
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,230
<i>I don't want you to trip and break
your neck on the mopped floors.</i>

480
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,879
Okay, bye.

481
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,317
Bye. Okay, that was weird, even for Ray.

482
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,551
- We should check on him.
- You go check on Ray.

483
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,640
We'll handle the egg.

484
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,475
Um... I'm sorry that our first date
got ruined by Nazis.

485
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,519
Who says it's ruined?

486
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,912
Okay, what do we know?

487
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,998
We found an egg, but it was fake.

488
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,160
Someone stole the real one.

489
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,709
What about that Gordon Gilchrist guy?

490
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,595
He's the one who found it,

491
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,400
so I don't know
why he would have stolen it.

492
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,736
Although I sort of think
his poor assistant, Vincent,

493
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,760
did most of the work.

494
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,915
- Wait. That's just like the book!
- It is?

495
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,914
The book from book club!

496
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,193
Vincent is the doormat!

497
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,192
Look, it's always the doormat.

498
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,272
It was the dog walker in the book,
and, now,

499
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,795
<i>this Vincent guy is mad
that he didn't get any credit.</i>

500
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:55,152
<i>So we find Vincent, take the egg,
and wipe everyone's memories. Easy.</i>

501
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,157
Ray. Ray.

502
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,630
Remember, if you kill a loved one,
Neron will take over.

503
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,399
Oh, well, here's the thing, Gary.
I like you.

504
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,200
But...

505
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,280
Oh...

506
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,840
Yeah.

507
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,677
Got it. Old Gare.

508
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,352
Not loved by the Legends.

509
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,952
Bottom of the pecking order
at the Bureau.

510
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,110
Constantine's plant sitter.

511
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,440
Always the butt of the joke.

512
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,592
Gary, it's not like that.

513
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,592
It is like that, Gary.

514
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,160
No one appreciates you.

515
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,594
They all think you're a fool

516
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,876
that they can use
whenever it's convenient for them.

517
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,474
But I respect you,
and I see your potential.

518
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,114
- Neron?
- Gary, don't listen to him.

519
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,554
He's trying to trick you.

520
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,752
A demon can't renege
on the deals they make.

521
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,753
So you can believe me when I say

522
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,200
I can make you whole again.

523
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,994
"Whole"?

524
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,913
Rebecca, first, let me say

525
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,914
that your novel <i>Uncaged Desires</i>
was a sexual epiphany for me.

526
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,616
I can't say
that I'm surprised.

527
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,313
My writing does have that effect.

528
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:27,440
But how did Officer Daphne
free Tank Tremors?

529
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,594
Can prison guards release inmates
just because they're in love?

530
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,674
Oh, well, you see, that was a metaphor.

531
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:37,590
After all, aren't we all
in our own prisons of desire?

532
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,072
Rebecca, in <i>Heatwaves,</i>

533
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,278
who is the unnamed villain
who is stalking Garima?

534
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,638
- Charlie?
- What is a villain?

535
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,315
Is it just someone
with a different point of view?

536
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,838
What's really stalking Garima
are the choices that she made.

537
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:01,594
So you're the real Rebecca Silver, huh?

538
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,753
Hi. Yes.

539
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,197
I mean, that is what I have embroidered
on my satin pillowcases.

540
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,317
Okay, then.

541
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:13,633
I have a question
about your novel <i>Raw Hides.</i>

542
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,760
When Captain Cash Harvey
fights the Prairie Bandits,

543
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:21,635
why does Nasgowa stow away
in his Conestoga wagon?

544
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,600
Well, you see, that is also a metaphor.

545
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,359
That is not a metaphor.
She really did it.

546
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,600
And she died because of it.

547
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,116
The real Rebecca Silver would know.

548
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,636
I am the real Rebecca Silver.

549
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,355
I have tea with lemon.

550
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,440
- I have a really small dog.
- You're a fraud.

551
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,989
Where is the real Rebecca?

552
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,916
Where's the real Rebecca?

553
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,391
- Where's the real Rebecca?
- Where's the real Rebecca?

554
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,075
Right, go to hell,
you stinking mouth-breathers.

555
00:29:54,121 --> 00:29:55,601
Where's the real Rebecca?

556
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,678
Where's the real Rebecca?

557
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,957
Where's the real Rebecca?

558
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,032
Quiet! Give me that.

559
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,632
Nasgowa chased Cash for one reason.

560
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:11,591
It's the same reason humans have gotten
together since the dawn of time.

561
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,918
It's why people like you
come to conventions

562
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,835
and dress up
as your favorite characters.

563
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,994
Why a man sits behind a desk, typing,

564
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,514
pouring out his heart.

565
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,878
Why an author,

566
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:30,114
a writer, replies to fans.

567
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,119
It's connection.

568
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,592
Human connection.

569
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,231
I am Rebecca Silver.

570
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:44,037
You are Rebecca.

571
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,879
I'd recognize that wisdom anywhere.

572
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,400
I would have come sooner, Nora.

573
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,195
But have you any idea how hard it is
to acquire a phoenix's tail feather?

574
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,878
I didn't. All right.

575
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,153
By the power above and below,

576
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:21,156
I call on you, Nora Darhk,
to return to this plane and rise reborn.

577
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,949
Come on, love.

578
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,273
Come back to me. Come on, love.

579
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,760
Neron...

580
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,896
No, no, no, it's all right, love.
It's all right.

581
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,115
He's gone. You did it.

582
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,999
- No.
- He's gone.

583
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,475
He has Ray.

584
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,037
Ray?

585
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,517
Gideon, where's Ray?

586
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,956
Nate, you shouldn't have come.

587
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,235
Ray, what's going on?

588
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,590
You should leave. You can't let me get...

589
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,390
Ray, what are you saying?

590
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,552
You've been acting so weird lately.

591
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,677
- I thought we were bros.
- It's not me.

592
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,752
Don't you see? It's near...

593
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,360
- What's near? Somebody's nearby?
- No.

594
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,876
All right, people. Gather around.

595
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,591
Vincent? What's the meaning of this?

596
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,555
- I found it.
- Hand over the egg.

597
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:38,078
- I should get credit for it.
- The egg is my accomplishment.

598
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,800
It belongs to me.

599
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,776
Everyone's memory of the egg
is about to be erased,

600
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,200
so don't get too bent out of shape.

601
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,034
Not so fast.

602
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,395
Finally, the egg is ours.

603
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,274
Oh, man, these guys.

604
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,396
I'm Ray. The rest of me isn't.

605
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,552
Nate, you have to get out of here.
You have to leave.

606
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,676
I won't leave you, buddy.

607
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,560
Okay, you got possessed by Neron.

608
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,080
You have to go.

609
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:12,471
- He's gonna make me kill you.
- No, because I believe you,

610
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,149
Raymond, are stronger than he is.

611
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,839
Nate, I'm so sorry.

612
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,351
Why are you hitting me?

613
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,713
Can't stop.

614
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,838
- We're bros.
- We are bros.

615
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:54,913
Okay, I give up. I give up.
You hear me, Neron? I give up.

616
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,754
Spare Nate, and I'll let you have me.

617
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,919
Just promise me you won't hurt him,
and I won't resist.

618
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,153
Deal.

619
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,557
It's nice to have a willing host.

620
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:29,079
But a promise is a promise.

621
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,836
- We gotta get that egg.
- On it.

622
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,835
Okay, I got you.

623
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:21,671
- See them whip skills?
- That gave me an idea for date night.

624
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,760
Hmm.

625
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,952
Oh, come on now. Don't be shy.

626
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,114
You're a little late, Johnny.

627
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:34,273
I've sort of taken over jolly old Ray.

628
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,917
I see you've lost a step.

629
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,391
That's the thing about mortals.
They age so quickly.

630
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:51,157
But don't worry, Johnny.
I won't let you die of old age.

631
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,274
Yeah, well, I might be
a little older, mate,

632
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,273
but I've picked up a few tricks
along the way.

633
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,439
That one's from Marie Laveau.

634
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,636
Cute trick.

635
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,896
But we both know you won't be able
to hold it for long.

636
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,434
You're a parasite.

637
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,950
And I will separate you from Ray Palmer.

638
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,591
Oh, Gary. Where have you been?

639
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,273
I was hiding in the lab.

640
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,394
Then I heard noises.

641
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,176
Yeah, well, go and get my steam trunk,

642
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,112
and we can exorcise this demon
right now.

643
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,256
Damn it, Gary. Now it's not the time

644
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,954
for you to be standing around
like some hapless idiot.

645
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,555
I can't hold this bastard forever.
Do it, now.

646
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,996
Demands a lot from you,
doesn't he, Gary?

647
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,440
But what has he ever done for you?

648
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,239
I, on the other hand,
brought you a gift.

649
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,039
Go ahead. Open it.

650
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,599
No, no, no.

651
00:36:55,681 --> 00:36:57,513
Don't accept anything from him, Gary.

652
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,199
My nipple.

653
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,000
Gary, listen to me. That part of you,
it belongs to hell now.

654
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,594
All right? Don't let it seduce you.

655
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,519
The same way John
seduced you into being unicorn bait?

656
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,395
It's beautiful.

657
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,360
It's cursed.

658
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,318
Now, back away from it, you bloody fool.

659
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,431
It belongs to you, Gary.

660
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,456
Come on, Gary. Think about
what you're doing, all right?

661
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,760
Don't give in to his temptation.

662
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,074
How did I do?

663
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,516
Time dweeb!
What the hell are you doing here?

664
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,592
- What do I do?
- Shut up, Gary.

665
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,477
I'm tired of being a doormat.

666
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,595
Gary, no.

667
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,072
Well done, Mr. Green.

668
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,356
I'm whole again.

669
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,912
All systems back online.

670
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:29,396
So, Zari, some big moves back there.

671
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,200
- Yeah, you were really brave.
- Thanks.

672
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,078
So why are you scared
to make a move on Nate?

673
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,400
Nate.

674
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,194
What happened?

675
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,595
- Where is he?
- Who?

676
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,994
Ray.

677
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,834
Neron's got him.

678
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,995
Sara, hey!

679
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,834
We got you
a collectible RomantiCon tote bag.

680
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,989
- Who died?
- Yeah, what's going on?

681
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,239
I have some bad news.

682
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,761
- I told you, I'm fine.
- She's stable, Director.

683
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,856
- Thank you.
- Ava, you shouldn't be here.

684
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,216
You should be scouring
every second of the timeline for Ray.

685
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,833
Agents are on it as we speak.

686
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,559
Why did he do that?

687
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,576
Look, I know you've been through a lot,
but I need your help.

688
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,434
My help?

689
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,600
Why?

690
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:39,593
Because, no matter how many agents
I send after Neron,

691
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,736
none of them can do what you do.

692
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:44,071
None of them have the powers
you have, Nora.

693
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,552
And I trust you.

694
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,876
Nora Darhk, I'm asking you
to face another demon.

695
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,911
But this time, I'm asking you to face it

696
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,914
as a member of the Time Bureau.

697
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,472
Let's do this.

698
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,796
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
you haven't recovered yet.

699
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,758
We gotta track down Ray.

700
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,915
You will,
when you're better. I promise.

701
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,469
You don't just throw a man down
with these sorts of injuries.

702
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,677
- It's mean-spirited.
- Don't be a baby.

703
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:27,719
- Does this hurt?
- Yes, Zari. It all hurts.

704
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,357
Where doesn't it hurt, Nate?

705
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,309
- Here?
- Yeah.

706
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,839
Here?

707
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,480
I guess there's an upside
to getting pummeled.

708
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:02,473
You know how I never let anyone know
what I'm...

709
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,990
really feeling?

710
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,192
It's kind of your thing.

711
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,960
That's how I feel, Nate.

712
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,112
I feel the same.

713
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,479
Gideon?

714
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,553
What kind of egg is that?

715
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:46,280
I believe, Dr. Heywood,
it's a dragon egg.

716
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,080
Oh...

717
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,676
Of course.
