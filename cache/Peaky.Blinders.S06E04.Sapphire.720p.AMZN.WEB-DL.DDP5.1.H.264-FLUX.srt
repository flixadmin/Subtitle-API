1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,639
My brother sends his apologies
for not being here

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,600
and would like to invite all of you
to his home for a meeting.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,440
All you have to do is sit with
Jack Nelson and talk about

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,960
a new golden age.

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,520
If anyone is going to kill
Tommy Shelby... It will be you.

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,760
The future belongs to us.

7
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,960
Your daughter has Consumption.

8
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,960
Consumption is a very
infectious disease.

9
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,120
While they X-ray Ruby,
they have to X-ray us.

10
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,160
It'll be the girl's mother who laid
the curse.

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,280
Perhaps she waited until your little
girl was seven

12
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,560
so you'd know how it feels.

13
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,200
Now that I'm without whisky, I can
hear the spirits clearly

14
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,520
and they are saying Ruby will be
well if I make amends.

15
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,120
She's gone, Tommy.

16
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,680
This programme contains some scenes

17
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,040
which some viewers may find
upsetting, strong language,

18
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,080
discriminatory language and content
and some scenes of a sexual nature.

# I am waiting for you

00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:55,880
# For only to adore you

29
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:00,680
# My heart is for you

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:21,800
# This is my grief for you

00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:33,600
# I will have you with me

00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:50,320
# For you are only

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:56,480
# My love, my love

00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:02,800
# My love. #

Arthur.

40
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,400
I've written some words.

41
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,360
I can't speak 'em.

42
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,240
ARTHUR EXHALES SHARPLY

43
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,880
You're the oldest.

44
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,880
You speak 'em for me.
ARTHUR EXHALES SHARPLY

45
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,280
I'm sorry, brother. I can't do it.

46
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,920
CREAKING

47
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,920
We could have afforded
a golden carriage.

48
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,400
She deserved a golden carriage.

49
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,560
But we didn't afford ourselves
that luxury.

50
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,800
Because gold doesn't work.

51
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,280
That was the last lesson
that Ruby taught us.

52
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,440
LAMP CREAKS

53
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,600
This place was her favourite place
in the whole world.

54
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,360
And she used to say...

55
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,960
.."Dad...

56
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,280
.."you never know what's going to
come down the river."

57
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,600
And it's true.

58
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:32,000
Little Ruby's fate came
a thousand miles too soon.

59
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,880
But in her name and in her memory
things will change.

60
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,800
And whatever comes down the river
from now on we will make good...

61
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,880
..we will make peaceful and honest
and good

62
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,200
and send it on down the river
better than it was.

63
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,000
In her memory we will do this.

64
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,440
HE SNIFFLES

65
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,720
But for now, we send her on,
to wherever it is you go...

66
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,160
..in the hope that if there
is a destination...

67
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,040
..that it's a yard like this,

68
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,800
with horses and boats for her
to play on.

69
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,640
Tom, I've got the petrol.

70
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,440
TOM EXHALES SHARPLY

71
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,120
Who will light the flame?

72
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,840
Jeremiah?

73
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,640
Jeremiah, you made her laugh.

74
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,240
You light the flame.

75
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,360
No, no! No! Lizzie...

76
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,800
No, you won't burn her! No!

77
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,160
Lizzie, shush, shush, shush!

78
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,280
SHE SOBS

79
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,560
I just want to see her.

80
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,600
I just want to see her face. We'll
go and see her together. Come on.

81
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,840
We'll go and see her together. Yeah.

82
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:26,000
SHE CRIES

83
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,840
Oh, my baby.

00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,400
SHE SNIFFLES

85
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,720
SHE SNIFFLES

86
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,120
The devils who did this will pay,
Ruby.

87
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,720
What do you mean?

88
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,480
What do you mean?

89
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,560
Where are you going?

90
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,360
THEY MOUTH SILENTLY

91
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,240
SHE MOUTHS SILENTLY

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,040

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,680
Evadne Barwell?

98
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,840
Yeah. Who's asking?

99
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,120
HE COCKS GUN

100
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,040
I am here on behalf of

Gold dust.

125
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,880
Our business is done, Esme.
Get out of the car.

126
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,200
Not quite done, Tommy.

127
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:12,120
I thought this would be a good time.
In fact, it's the perfect time.

128
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,160
Some business is still unfinished.

129
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,840
Christians say, "The Lord gives,
the Lord takes away."

130
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,880
Our spirits are the same.

131
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,120
Spirits just took away your child.

132
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,080
Get out of the car, Esme.
ENGINE STARTS

133
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,080
But those same spirits want to give
you a different child, Tommy.

134
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,160
HE SIGHS
What child?

ENGINE STOPS

136
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,040
A daughter lost.

137
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,400
A son found.

138
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,000
Before you went to France,

139
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,360
a long time ago at Appleby Fair
you slept with a girl.

140
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,960
Her name was Zelda. I met her.

141
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,920
She said you slept together under
a hazel tree, May 1914.

142
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,320
When she fell pregnant, her father
threatened to kill you,

143
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,400
but you'd already joined the army
and gone away to France.

144
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,120
You remember the girl and the
hazel tree, don't you, Tommy.

145
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,600
Whoever that boy is, Esme...

146
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,280
..whoever he is, our business is
done here. I brought you

147
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,800
to this camp for a reason, and I
brought him as well.

148
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,040
He is yours.

149
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,080
A boy born with hazel eyes.

150
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,640
He calls himself Duke.

151
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,920
His mother is dead. He's a thief.

152
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,480
He works the fairgrounds, but he

153
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,640
says he wants more to his life than
big wheels and carousels.

154
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,760
If the losing of Ruby has left
a hole in your heart...

155
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,280
..I'll send him to you.

156
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,440
If you give me a bit more gold...

157
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,520
..I'll tell him Tommy Shelby
can offer a man far,

158
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,120
far more than big wheels
and carousels.

159
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,440
HE EXHALES SHARPLY

160
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,360
Is our business done or not, Tommy?

161
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,920
I know where you went.

162
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,840
I'm going to spend more hours
working in the Commons

163
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,960
with Mr Churchill.

164
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,240
His fight is my fight.

165
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,120
I sat like a stone and thought about
you killing someone in her name.

166
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,800
And the Shelby institutions
will be expanded.

167
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,200
I will set up a fund to research the
causes and cures for Consumption.

168
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,040
Did the woman you kill
have children?

169
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,400
10,000 children die every year,
Lizzie. Go to bed, Tommy.

170
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,040
I've been reading about new
research.

171
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,640
Stop and close your fucking eyes.
I will not...

172
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,280
I will not stop!

173
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,680
What is this good that you
will become?

174
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,640
SHE BREATHES DEEPLY

175
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,600
I killed a woman.

176
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,640
I killed a woman and three men.

177
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,160
And their bodies will be thrown
aboard the boat,

178
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,600
like all the other bodies,

179
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,400
but I am stepping off that boat
and onto another boat.

180
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,520
Do you understand?

181
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,840
Yeah.

182
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,600
The doctor from the Sanatorium
called and said that he needs

183
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,640
to speak to you urgently.

184
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,920
But I think now you are beyond
the help of doctors. Lizzie...

185
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,160
Frances said Arthur's here.

186
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,000
Tommy?

187
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,520
Tom? Yeah, it's me.

188
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,160
Ah, fuck.

189
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,400
Arthur, give me a light, will you?

190
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,800
I can't find my lighter.

191
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,920
HE EXHALES SHARPLY

192
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,640
I'm sorry I couldn't speak at the
wagon, Tom.

193
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,360
Don't be sorry.

194
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,960
What are you doing here?

195
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,000
Waiting for this fucking cup
to fill up.

196
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,640
Nearly empty, this barrel.

197
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,920
There are plenty of barrels, Arthur.

198
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,400
Start another barrel.

199
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,000
I thought maybe they're all full
of fucking blood.

200
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,600
The junk, Tom...

201
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,160
..fucks you up your mind.

202
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,960
You know, Arthur.

203
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,200
You was already fucked up.

204
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,520
You was fucked up since you
were a kid.

205
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,880
This is my theory.

206
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,520
It's from that time I gave you

207
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,080
a beating when you were 12
and I was nine.

208
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,320
We were fighting over cigarettes.

209
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:54,760
Maybe when I had you down
on the ground,

210
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,880
I gave you one too many to
the head.

211
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,680
It was a draw, though, Tom.

212
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,760
Nah, I beat you.

213
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,320
I had you pinned.
You actually didn't.

214
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:14,320
We both agreed. You're so fucked,
you can't remember, brother.

215
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,600
I do. I do remember little things.

216
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,240
I know you do.

217
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,680
So, do I.

218
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,680
The fog and the gas is clearing, eh?

219
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,280
TOMMY COUGHS

220
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,280
Here, that cup's nearly full.
Pass it here.

221
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,720
That's...

222
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,480
Tommy...stuff any more.

223
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,920
You don't drink no more, Tom.

224
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,880
After Polly was gone, Arthur...

225
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,160
..I thought I could just march
and march.

226
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,280
I just kept up that fucking left,

227
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,960
right, left, right, left, right,
fucking rhythm.

228
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,720
I'd never have to stop.

229
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,960
Then Ruby went.

230
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,360
I stumbled and crashed.

231
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,720
And now here I am...

232
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:37,160
..sat on my arse on the ground

233
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,440
like a fucking tunneller..

234
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,800
..with my old comrade Arthur.

235
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,280
Remember the January, Arthur?

236
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,160
The family boat?

237
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,640
The whole family living on something

238
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,000
the size of ten of these
fucking barrels.

239
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:07,920
Remember that night at Tile Cross,

240
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,440
16 of us sleeping on the boat,
the coppers come.

241
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,240
We all swam like rats.

242
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,000
Except for Arthur.

243
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:21,840
Arthur holds them off with
a boat hook, all on his own.

244
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,800
And I remember,

245
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,400
I climbed back up at the lock
and looked back

246
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,520
and saw you waving that
fucking boat hook

247
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,560
in the copper's faces...
ARTHUR CHUCKLES

248
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,880
..on your own.

249
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,760
That's when I realised.

250
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:45,120
When I had you on the ground,
all them years ago,

251
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,360
it's because you let me win.

252
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,720
You wanted me to win.

253
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,800
you've wanted me to win ever since.

254
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:07,720
What chance do I have...if you start
doing that again, eh?

255
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,840
You'll stop.

256
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:15,000
You'll stop cos the family
needs you to.

257
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,760
It's like that long tunnel
on the Dudley stretch.

258
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,720
You remember Dudley canal,
line number one?

259
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:26,680
3,172 yards of fucking
pitch blackness and rats swimming.

260
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,240
Yeah. Then we'd come round that
corner and there'd be

261
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:32,000
a shaft of light.
And then we'd know.

262
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,720
Yeah. And you and me would both know
it was nearly done.

263
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,040
That's where we are now, Arthur.

264
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,040
Just a few more yards to go.

265
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,280
Then you'll change your ways.

266
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,080
And I'll change the fucking world.

267
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:15,400
# Like a slumber
In the moss

268
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:22,160
# Like a display
In the dark

269
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:28,160
# I have loved you
From the start

270
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:35,040
# But there's cold veneer
near the cloud of you

271
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,080
# Of you

272
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:42,280
# Of you

273
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:45,200
# Of you

274
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,440
# Oh

275
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:56,320
# Sit on back in thrones of blue
And inlay black, so righteous you

276
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,800
# Bear cold decree

277
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:03,320
# It's dead to me

278
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,800
# Sit on through
while your mistakes loom

279
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,520
# You're stone dead blind
and it's drowning all

280
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,240
# Your company. #

281
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:16,040
We assumed, at this late hour,
you would've had dinner.

282
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:19,880
There are drinks and sandwiches, if
you want. We're not here to eat.

283
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,000
Mr Shelby will be down shortly.

284
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,320
Please, tell Mr Shelby on behalf of
us all

285
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,280
that changing the world can wait.

286
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,920
He doesn't want to wait.

287
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,440
There is Champagne.

288
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,840
Oh, goodie.

289
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,680
Charles?

290
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,560
I heard cars.

291
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,440
Mr Shelby, the guests are...

292
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,720
I know.

293
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,800
Dad, there's a Bentley and a
Rolls-Royce.

294
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,800
Yeah.

295
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,320
Go to bed, Charles.

296
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,800
I can't sleep.

297
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,080
I see her, when I shut my eyes.

298
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,720
Go to your mum.

299
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,800
She'll be awake.

300
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,760
She holds on to me.

301
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,360
Let her hold on to you.

302
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,600
You hear me?

303
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,160
Always let her hold on to you.

304
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,640
Go on.

305
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,120
Mr Shelby, the guests said they
would understand if...

306
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,200
Have you served them drinks? Yes.

307
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,520
Yeah.

308
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,560
OK, Frances.

309
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,640
The agenda is in my head.

310
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,960
The agenda is in my head.

311
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,200
I'm OK.

312
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,880
Do I look OK?

313
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,800
If someone touches you, you won't
shatter.

314
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,320
Sing it.

315
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,360
Sing it. I love that song.

316
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,400
I...

317
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,800
..can't be singing rebel songs in
a house in grief and mourning.

318
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,640
Sing it to me softly.

319
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,960
It breaks my heart.

320
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,400
Don't look at him. He's English.

321
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,680
He can block his ears.

322
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:51,160
Darling, should she sing her rebel
IRA song, while we wait

323
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,120
or would that be inappropriate?

324
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,360
You know I went to a meeting of
similar intent to this in Berlin.

325
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,120
Attended by the Chancellor
himself...

326
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,440
..and Goering and Himmler.

327
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,520
It lasted until the sun came up.

328
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,160
We spoke about the future of the
world in a serious way.

329
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,360
When the first rays of light entered
the room,

330
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,360
we all stood and stared at it, as if
it were the world to come.

331
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,360
There was no singing, no giggling.

332
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,160
And when breakfast was served on the
terrace, overlooking the mountains,

333
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,920
they brought up some Jews.

334
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,480
And while we ate our eggs, they were
forced to eat grass.

335
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,480
And we watched as we sipped our
coffee.

336
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,880
We should all remember this is
serious business.

337
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,760
Oh, Diana.

338
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,680
Now, look what you've done. You have
killed the mood.

339
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,240
Let her sing her fucking song to
raise our spirits. Go on, please.

340
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:29,600
# In a neat little town
they call Belfast

341
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:33,320
# Apprentice to trade I was bound

342
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:37,720
# And many an hour's sweet
happiness

343
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:41,680
# Have I spent
in that neat little town

344
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,560
# A sad misfortune came over me. #

345
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:06,720
# Blackbird, sit on my shoulder
and tell me a song. #

346
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,440
Did it break?

347
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,080
Mum will fix it for you.

348
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,040
GLASS SHATTERS

349
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:20,040
# When I cry, do you hear in colour
or black and white, bird?

350
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,920
MEN LAUGH

351
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:29,520
# The morning is new
but the feeling is old

352
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:36,120
# Intervene, blackbird, and
shorten the road

353
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:46,640
# Blackbird, the way I imagined
love was wrong

354
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,480
# I've come

355
00:31:54,560 --> 00:32:00,120
# to love him like I couldn't
fathom, blackbird

356
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:09,160
# What I tap away at
I fear and I long

357
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,880
# Intervene, blackbird, and
shorten the road

358
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,640
GUN FIRES

359
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:45,920
# Blackbird, slip into my slumber
and show me a song

360
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,600
# When I dream

361
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:59,240
# Do you see in colour or at all,
bird?

362
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:09,560
# The picture is peaceful but I
dream alone

363
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:15,080
# Intervene, blackbird, and
shorten the road. #

364
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,280
SOBS: She's not here any more.

365
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:45,840
# Her eyes, they shone like diamonds

366
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,960
# I thought her the Queen. #

367
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:51,000
Mr Shelby. No, please, no
condolences.

368
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,480
Thank you all for coming.

369
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,400
Now, let's try to find out

370
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,840
how this new world of ours will
look, shall we?

371
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,160
Perhaps, Mr Mosley, we can turn to
what practical things

372
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:11,520
Mr Nelson can do to further our
cause, while he's in the country.

373
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:15,040
It's me who has the ear of the
President of the United States.

374
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,960
Which is kind of why I'm here,
right?

375
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:21,880
We do, indeed, have things for you
to whisper into the President's ear.

376
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,480
Tell him we are England.

377
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,000
We are the mood England is in.

378
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:32,480
And in Ireland, appeasers to the
English abound

379
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:36,680
but we represent the true liberated
spirit of the country that...

380
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,120
..populated your own.

381
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,200
I hear about communists in both
places.

382
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,400
We are the bulwark against them.

383
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,400
When it comes to the working class,

384
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,760
we could move our people from
Republicanism...

385
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,880
..to Fascism with just a nudge.

386
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,320
They trust us.

387
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,320
You ride with hounds, Mr Mosley.

388
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,240
Will you hunt communists?

389
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,080
Oh, my hounds are baying.

390
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,920
Shelby...

391
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,680
..you run as a socialist.

392
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:20,760
Mr Shelby has one of the largest
Commons majorities in England.

393
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,120
In the heart of England.

394
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,680
When the time comes, he'll resign
his party whip

395
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,440
and run as an independent.

396
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,920
But underneath, do you truly believe
in the cause, Mr Shelby?

397
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,880
I'm here.

398
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,160
Mr Nelson, I'm here four nights...

399
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,000
Four nights after and I am here...

400
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,360
..in this room, in this meeting,
I am here and I am serious.

401
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,520
Prove it to him.

402
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,520
Prove it physically.

403
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,640
Perish Judah.

404
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,560
Perish Judah.

405
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,360
That thing is going to get us
killed.

406
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,920
Go to bed.

407
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:57,280
At school, they've stopped talking
to me.

408
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,120
They say the black rubs off.

409
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,360
When they come to power, they'll
take her off you.

410
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,880
They're going to separate us all
out.

411
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,520
They'll send her to Africa.

412
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,480
Yeah?

413
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,360
And where will they send you?

414
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,360
Where will they send you, Karl?

415
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:29,240
You're half Gypsy, so...

416
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,720
..to Egypt maybe?

417
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,440
Something I never told you before...

418
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,280
..because it wasn't important.

419
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,120
Maybe now, it is.

420
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,280
Your dad was Jewish.

421
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,560
He was the son of a tailor in
Stechford.

422
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,120
They changed their name to Thorne

423
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,520
to stop the bricks coming through
the window.

424
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,600
So, where will they send you, Karl?

425
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,040
Mr Nelson, you can report back
to your President

426
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:09,440
that the aristocracy and the
meritocracy are united

427
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,560
in their conviction that a new order
is coming.

428
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:19,080
Also, Mr Nelson, at present our
weapons are coming from Germany.

429
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,520
The British are closing our supply
lines down.

430
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,720
We would value a supply from Boston.

431
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:28,760
Weapons, I can give you, if they're
to be used in a good cause.

432
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:31,760
And while on the subject of import
and export,

433
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:35,400
Mr Shelby, in light of our new
relationship,

434
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,560
and since you have proven your
commitment

435
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,000
in a most extraordinary way,

436
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:44,200
Boston is now officially open for
the importation of your merchandise.

437
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,760
Good.

438
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,640
If we have established what we came
here to establish,

439
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,440
perhaps we should all say goodnight.

440
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,760
Absolutely.

441
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,800
HE SHOUTS

442
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:30,520
That's the same typewriter you
bought me all those years ago...

443
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,440
..to help me become respectable.

444
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,960
Do you remember?

445
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,880
Yeah.

446
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,520
This arrived.

447
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,000
It's from the sanatorium.

448
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,760
I've already paid Ruby's medical
bills.

449
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,720
I don't think it's a bill.

450
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,520
It says it's urgent. It's from the
senior consultant.

451
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,360
Why didn't you come to bed?

452
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,760
Why didn't you come to bed?

453
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,760
I'm typing up my recollection of the
meeting.

454
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:41,280
If I...if I do it straight away, I
can quote people word for word.

455
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,960
The information is more...

456
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,480
..useful to Mr Churchill if it is
word for word.

457
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,760
I burnt her chair.

458
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,160
The paint on the wood left a smell
in the air.

459
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,000
I didn't open the window.

460
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,280
I quite like the smell.

461
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,600
Not yet.

462
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,640
Not yet.

463
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:05,160
I have this work to do cos now I
know...

464
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,360
..that I will change.

465
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,360
That I have to change.

466
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:14,920
And change for good, Lizzie.

467
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,680
Not just yet.

468
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,120
PHONE RINGS

469
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,520
Hello?

470
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,160
Oh.

471
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:20,000
# She had a heartful of love
and devotion

472
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:23,520
# She had a mindful of tyranny
and terror

473
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:27,720
# Well, I try
I do, I really try

474
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:31,880
# But I just...
Baby, I do, I error

475
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:35,680
# So, come and find me
my darling one

476
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:39,280
# I'm down to the grounds
the very dregs

477
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:42,400
# Here she comes
blocking the sun

478
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,480
# Blood running down
the inside of her legs

479
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:50,360
# The moon in the sky is battered
and mangled

480
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:53,960
# And the bells from the chapel
go jingle-jangle

481
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:59,640
# Jingle-jangle, jingle-jangle
Jingle-jangle, jingle-jangle

482
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:02,520
# Do you love me?

483
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:05,800
# Do you love me?

484
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:08,120
# Do you love me? #

485
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:09,640
KNOCKING

486
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:13,120
# Do you love me? #

487
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,040
I saw him leave.

488
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:21,360
He keeps this apartment expressly
for this purpose, doesn't he?

489
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,320
Are you following me, Mr Shelby?

490
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,280
I'm flattered...

491
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:30,240
..but why?

492
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,880
When I do business with someone,

493
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:34,720
I make it my business to know their
secrets.

494
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:39,400
Mosley's reputation is no secret.

495
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,520
Not him, you.

496
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,200
How did you know I'd come here?

497
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,560
I know things.

498
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:52,000
I read people's minds, you know.

499
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:57,920
Little glances across tables. It's a
gift.

500
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,120
The whole family...

501
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:02,000
..witches and sorcerers.

502
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:12,840
Your uncle will disown you.

503
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,760
Fucking his business partner behind
his back.

504
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:19,920
You think he has morals?

505
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,200
He's a Catholic.

506
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,760
Men do what they want, women do what
they are told.

507
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:27,320
Will you tell Michael?

508
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:29,920
Michael is family.

509
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:32,920
We are a family healed.

510
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:36,880
You have no interest in me...

511
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,200
..or in Michael.

512
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,760
So, why don't you just tell me what
you actually want?

513
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,440
You will be with Mosley...

514
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:58,920
..when he's in Berlin.

515
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:01,160
You'll be in the room,

516
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:04,000
when he meets senior members of the
German Government.

517
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:07,360
I want to know what is discussed...

518
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,280
..and I want to know what is
decided.

519
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:13,040
And if I lie?

520
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:16,800
I will know.

521
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,880
You know Michael thinks you're the
devil...

522
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,600
..and I think he might actually be
right.

523
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,880
That was the other reason I came
here.

524
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:39,760
What are Michael's real intentions
toward me, Gina?

525
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:41,320
And if you lie, I will know.

526
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,160
Tommy...

527
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:53,000
..he intends to complete the deal.

528
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,680
And then, you both walk away.

529
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,520
WHISPERS: Fuck.

530
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:19,120
BUZZING

531
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,560
KNOCKING

532
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:33,880
Come.

533
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:38,120
Mr Shelby, Doctor Holford.

534
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:42,440
Send him in.

535
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,960
You said it had to be in person.

536
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:53,280
Here I am.

537
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:56,800
You might want to sit down.

538
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:07,320
Mr Shelby, I know that you are still
grieving for your daughter...

539
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:10,720
..but I have news that cannot wait.

540
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:21,000
When you were X-rayed and examined
at the sanatorium ten days ago...

541
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,280
..there was no TB found in your
lung.

542
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:31,560
But I am afraid they found something
else.

543
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:34,080
Something related to your daughter's
illness.

544
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,880
They tried to speak to you at the
hospital

545
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,600
but you were not co-operating.

546
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:46,840
After your daughter's death,

547
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:50,680
you could not be found to be
informed in person.

548
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:54,040
Eventually, as your personal doctor,
they called me.

549
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:00,360
I didn't offer you tea. You look
like death. Do you want tea?

550
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,360
No.

551
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:07,680
At the sanatorium, they conducted
blood tests.

552
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:13,480
The tests suggest that the shadow
you can see

553
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:15,640
at the base of your skull...

554
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:17,160
..is not cancer.

555
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:20,080
It is tuberculoma.

556
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:26,120
A tubercular growth caused by the
same bacteria as TB.

557
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,960
You may have picked it up from your
daughter.

558
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:37,880
Once this disease enters a
household, it can run wild.

559
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:40,560
It can be transmitted with a simple
kiss.

560
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:47,320
It seems the Shelby household is no
exception.

561
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:55,440
Mr Shelby, as I say, I am aware that
you are still grieving...

562
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:59,280
..but you must understand this is
very serious.

563
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:04,760
From the size of the tumour,
expansion must've been rapid.

564
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:09,960
I have no doubt that you are already
experiencing symptoms?

565
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:13,640
Have you recently suffered seizures?

566
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:20,600
Bouts of weakness, dissociation,
hallucinations?

567
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,240
Why didn't you come and see me?

568
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,160
I have work to do.

569
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:39,600
Am I a danger to others?

570
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,000
No.

571
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:46,640
Unlike TB, tuberculoma is not
infectious.

572
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:50,800
Mr Shelby, it is not infectious...

573
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:53,160
..but in your case...

574
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:55,360
..I am afraid it is inoperable.

575
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:59,040
The growth is in your brain stem.

576
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:00,440
Any attempt to remove it

577
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:02,960
would result in trauma and brain
haemorrhage.

578
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,440
Whilst you were refusing my calls,

579
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:12,880
I showed your X-rays to three of
the best surgeons in the country.

580
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:19,960
They all said they would not
operate...

581
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:21,400
..as it would be futile.

582
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:27,360
Of course, you will want a second
opinion for yourself.

583
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:31,680
Doctor Helen Rutherford at St
Thomas'.

584
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,080
She is a friend.

585
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:45,800
This...

586
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,000
How bad will it get?

587
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,560
As the tumour grows,

588
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:01,480
the rate of physical and mental
deterioration will increase.

589
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:10,760
Eventually, you will need people
around you constantly,

590
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:12,560
who love you very much.

591
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:17,120
How long?

592
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:23,840
I understand you have defeated many
enemies, Mr Shelby.

593
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,440
Now, you have a new one...

594
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:28,800
..inside you.

595
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:31,720
You cannot defeat it...

596
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:35,800
..but you can keep it at bay for a
while.

597
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:40,040
If you live correctly, if you are
determined and if you fight...

598
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:42,000
I asked you a question.

599
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:43,640
So, I want an answer.

600
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:46,480
I don't want your fucking
platitudes.

601
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:51,040
How long before I need people around
me, who love me very much?

602
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:57,760
Sorry. It's fine, Lizzie.

603
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:59,720
My accountant here was just leaving.

604
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,840
I will telephone you, when I get
back to London.

605
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:09,320
No, I don't have enough time.

606
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:12,080
You're an accountant, give me a
fucking number now.

607
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,840
One year.

608
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,080
Perhaps 18 months.

609
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:20,600
That's fine. That's all I need to
know.

610
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:23,960
I will adjust my finances
accordingly. Thank you.

611
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:29,680
I will write to you, explaining the
full implications. Yeah, thank you.

612
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,200
Good day.

613
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,920
Something serious?

614
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,160
No, no, just a...

615
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:52,360
..just a bill I wasn't expecting and
I...

616
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:54,040
I'll have to pay it.

617
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:06,040
Will you give me a minute on my own,
Lizzie?

618
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:11,240
Yeah.

619
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,280
Not a devil...

620
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:33,280
..just an ordinary mortal man.

621
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:42,080
POLLY: There will be a war in this
family...

622
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:46,160
..and one of you will die.

623
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:50,080
WHISPERS: Polly.

624
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:54,480
Just give me enough time to do what
I have to do.

625
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:58,000
Kill.

626
00:56:58,080 --> 00:56:59,840
Kill.
