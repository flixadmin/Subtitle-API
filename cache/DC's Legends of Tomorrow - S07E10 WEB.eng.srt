1
00:00:18,851 --> 00:00:20,428
Wait, wait, wait.

2
00:00:20,452 --> 00:00:22,430
You seriously want
to stop the assassination

3
00:00:22,454 --> 00:00:24,098
of Archduke Franz Ferdinand?

4
00:00:24,122 --> 00:00:26,622
Okay, let's... let's just hear her out.

5
00:00:27,659 --> 00:00:29,237
After the assassination of the archduke,

6
00:00:29,261 --> 00:00:31,706
Europe's rival alliances
declared war on each other.

7
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:34,172
This singular murder
led to 20 million deaths.

8
00:00:34,196 --> 00:00:36,040
The assassination
of the archduke, therefore,

9
00:00:36,064 --> 00:00:38,045
is what is known
as a fixed point in history.

10
00:00:38,069 --> 00:00:39,512
Sorry, a fixed point?

11
00:00:39,536 --> 00:00:41,313
Fixed point. Noun.

12
00:00:41,337 --> 00:00:43,448
An occurrence so pivotal to history

13
00:00:43,472 --> 00:00:45,953
that no time travel
is allowed on or near it.

14
00:00:45,977 --> 00:00:48,055
I'm a little fuzzy
on my time travel logic.

15
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,723
How is this a good idea?

16
00:00:49,747 --> 00:00:51,959
Yes, I appreciate
your resolve, Miss Gideon,

17
00:00:51,983 --> 00:00:54,694
but, you see, we can't just go
and prevent the Great War.

18
00:00:54,718 --> 00:00:56,330
Now, you were the ones
that taught me that.

19
00:00:56,354 --> 00:00:58,031
Well, exactly. Fixed points

20
00:00:58,055 --> 00:01:00,067
are shrouded in mystery,
even to evil Gideon.

21
00:01:00,091 --> 00:01:02,502
Still, she and her robots
won't be able to resist

22
00:01:02,526 --> 00:01:04,671
restoring the timeline,
and we will let them.

23
00:01:04,695 --> 00:01:08,407
Oh, so we're not actually
going to stop the World War.

24
00:01:08,431 --> 00:01:10,444
We're just gonna let her
think we are to lure her in.

25
00:01:10,468 --> 00:01:13,113
And the assassination was
a notoriously chaotic event,

26
00:01:13,137 --> 00:01:15,776
Which will give us the window
we need to take back the ship.

27
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,346
Making the robots do the work
of fixing the timeline

28
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,781
while we unplug your evil twin.

29
00:01:20,805 --> 00:01:22,616
That is diabolical, Gideon.

30
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,185
- I learned from the best.
- All right, gang.

31
00:01:25,209 --> 00:01:28,856
I know it has been a rough road
since we lost our Waverider,

32
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,991
but that ends now.

33
00:01:31,015 --> 00:01:32,826
This time we're gonna win,

34
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:36,797
and today we are going home.

35
00:01:36,821 --> 00:01:38,466
All right, gang-gang.

36
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,634
The assassination
was such a famous fiasco,

37
00:01:40,658 --> 00:01:44,237
I kindly decided to draw you
a diagram to help explain.

38
00:01:44,261 --> 00:01:46,807
Ooh, I didn't know you were an artist.

39
00:01:46,831 --> 00:01:48,576
And now I see why.

40
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,278
No, I get it. It's... abstract.

41
00:01:51,302 --> 00:01:54,314
Okay, so my drawing skills
are a little rusty.

42
00:01:54,338 --> 00:01:56,083
You don't have to be
so insensitive, you jerks.

43
00:01:56,107 --> 00:01:57,852
- Now just shut up and focus.
- Sorry.

44
00:01:57,876 --> 00:02:00,387
All right, so there are
members of a secret society

45
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:02,856
called the Black Hand
on the scene that day,

46
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,459
including the eventual
assassin Gavrilo Princip.

47
00:02:06,483 --> 00:02:07,795
The assassin set up a course

48
00:02:07,819 --> 00:02:09,864
from the archduke's
motorcade route in Sarajevo.

49
00:02:09,888 --> 00:02:11,266
Copy.

50
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:14,067
Where does the hippopotamus
come into play?

51
00:02:14,091 --> 00:02:16,403
That's the archduke's car.

52
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:18,705
He's waving.

53
00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:21,496
Oh, very abstract.

54
00:02:22,533 --> 00:02:26,046
Okay, so we will set up here
next to the balloon salesman.

55
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:29,538
That is the assassin,
and he's holding a grenade.

56
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:32,219
The assassin tossed
the grenade at the motorcade,

57
00:02:32,243 --> 00:02:35,655
but it bounced off the car
and blew up nearby.

58
00:02:35,679 --> 00:02:37,491
So Princip, with his mission a bust,

59
00:02:37,515 --> 00:02:39,359
went to a nearby sandwich shop.

60
00:02:39,383 --> 00:02:41,593
Hey, I see that sandwich,
and you know what?

61
00:02:41,617 --> 00:02:43,962
That is some attention
to detail on the lettuce.

62
00:02:43,986 --> 00:02:46,065
- Good job, bud.
- Yeah.

63
00:02:46,089 --> 00:02:47,966
That's an explosion.

64
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,635
The motorcade took a wrong turn

65
00:02:49,659 --> 00:02:52,271
and went straight past
Princip's lunch spot.

66
00:02:52,295 --> 00:02:54,373
So Princip sees the archduke,

67
00:02:54,397 --> 00:02:57,409
realizes this is his moment,

68
00:02:57,433 --> 00:02:59,878
and shoots him point-blank.

69
00:02:59,902 --> 00:03:04,288
Okay, so our surest shot
at unfixing the fixpoint

70
00:03:04,312 --> 00:03:07,286
is to take out the three assassins.

71
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:10,022
And the best place to do that
is at the Cosic Tavern

72
00:03:10,046 --> 00:03:11,557
where the assassins went that morning.

73
00:03:11,581 --> 00:03:13,492
Okay, so we'll knock out the Black Hand

74
00:03:13,516 --> 00:03:15,361
just long enough that
they miss the motorcade.

75
00:03:15,385 --> 00:03:18,363
Meanwhile, we'll need
to hide the time machine.

76
00:03:18,387 --> 00:03:19,863
Astra can work her Permuto spell,

77
00:03:19,887 --> 00:03:21,132
turn it into something more portable,

78
00:03:21,156 --> 00:03:22,200
and bring it back here.

79
00:03:22,224 --> 00:03:23,268
- Yes.
- Nice.

80
00:03:23,292 --> 00:03:25,770
And then the team
will get into position.

81
00:03:25,794 --> 00:03:28,406
- By that swimming pool.
- Field, Gary.

82
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,575
Field. And when Gideon sends her robots

83
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:32,477
to keep the 20th century on course,

84
00:03:32,501 --> 00:03:35,632
we will be ready
to hijack our home back.

85
00:03:37,606 --> 00:03:38,716
Yeah.

86
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,286
And with that, we have a plan.

87
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:44,274
Nay, we have a foolproof plan.

88
00:03:55,956 --> 00:03:58,635
There they are, assassins
for the Black Hand.

89
00:03:58,659 --> 00:04:00,656
_

90
00:04:03,998 --> 00:04:06,061
Now's our chance.

91
00:04:10,804 --> 00:04:14,809
I'm sorry, but if you'll come with me.

92
00:04:16,344 --> 00:04:18,322
I think I'll stay right here.

93
00:04:18,346 --> 00:04:20,391
I have to insist.

94
00:04:20,415 --> 00:04:24,480
We wouldn't want to make... a scene.

95
00:04:35,228 --> 00:04:38,341
Look, I think there's
a misunderstanding happening.

96
00:04:38,365 --> 00:04:40,877
You clearly don't belong here.

97
00:04:40,901 --> 00:04:42,846
- We're on our honeymoon.
- We're backpackers.

98
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,080
- What he said.
- What she said.

99
00:04:44,104 --> 00:04:45,915
We really should be
better at this by now.

100
00:04:45,939 --> 00:04:47,751
Ha. Don't worry.

101
00:04:47,775 --> 00:04:49,452
Most time travelers

102
00:04:49,476 --> 00:04:51,843
blow their covers even quicker.

103
00:04:52,946 --> 00:04:54,943
Come with me.

104
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,759
What is this place?

105
00:05:10,664 --> 00:05:12,741
You think you're the only ones

106
00:05:12,765 --> 00:05:15,678
who want to save Archduke Ferdinand?

107
00:05:15,702 --> 00:05:18,647
This is the place

108
00:05:18,671 --> 00:05:20,483
for people like you...

109
00:05:20,507 --> 00:05:23,486
time travelers who are foolish enough

110
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:27,423
to try and prevent World War I.

111
00:05:27,447 --> 00:05:30,612
Welcome to The Fixed Point.

112
00:05:48,873 --> 00:05:55,873
- Synced and corrected by Firefly -
- www.addic7ed.com -

113
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,376
What the hell is this?

114
00:05:59,912 --> 00:06:02,124
These people are all time travelers.

115
00:06:02,148 --> 00:06:03,692
What are they doing here?

116
00:06:03,716 --> 00:06:05,861
How come I didn't know about this?

117
00:06:05,885 --> 00:06:06,994
What's with the tape?

118
00:06:07,018 --> 00:06:08,629
Oh, it's Gwyn's time machine.

119
00:06:08,653 --> 00:06:11,766
- Gideon had me transform it.
- The tape was my idea.

120
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:14,368
ELO's "Time"...
it's a whole concept album

121
00:06:14,392 --> 00:06:17,772
about a time traveler torn
between love and technology.

122
00:06:17,796 --> 00:06:19,974
Cute.

123
00:06:19,998 --> 00:06:22,110
All right. Moving on.

124
00:06:22,134 --> 00:06:24,278
- Don't mind if I do.
- Turns out

125
00:06:24,302 --> 00:06:27,381
there's a lot more going on
in Sarajevo than we thought.

126
00:06:27,405 --> 00:06:28,850
Oh, yeah. Fixed points

127
00:06:28,874 --> 00:06:30,751
are catnip for disrupter types.

128
00:06:30,775 --> 00:06:34,355
I created this space
to provide a watering hole

129
00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:36,323
for those who want
a piece of the action...

130
00:06:36,347 --> 00:06:38,591
whether they're here
to stop the assassination

131
00:06:38,615 --> 00:06:40,913
or just to watch people try.

132
00:06:47,591 --> 00:06:50,756
Oh, here we go. Our next competitor.

133
00:06:53,964 --> 00:06:56,476
- Is that a...
- It's a time portal.

134
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,613
Morning of June 28, 1914,
when the motorcade began.

135
00:07:00,637 --> 00:07:03,650
Okay, folks, our next competitor is up.

136
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:05,473
Making his approach.

137
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:09,555
It's a live feed. How?

138
00:07:09,579 --> 00:07:13,765
Oh, it's, uh, archival film
taken by bystanders

139
00:07:13,789 --> 00:07:16,897
pieced together to form a view
of the whole motorcade.

140
00:07:16,921 --> 00:07:18,598
The film updates

141
00:07:18,622 --> 00:07:21,921
each time an attempt
becomes history itself.

142
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:29,708
You get your ticket. You wait your turn.

143
00:07:29,732 --> 00:07:31,576
You take your shot. Them's the rules.

144
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,113
Well, we're not here
to follow your rules.

145
00:07:34,137 --> 00:07:36,749
I wouldn't do that if I were you,

146
00:07:36,773 --> 00:07:39,518
because although the filmstrip changes,

147
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:43,074
it always ends the same way.

148
00:07:55,491 --> 00:07:56,621
Holy crap!

149
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:06,111
Wait, d-did he-did he just...

150
00:08:06,135 --> 00:08:08,347
Self-immolation pays out.

151
00:08:08,371 --> 00:08:10,816
Cumurija Road pays out.

152
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,085
You see, you try to change time

153
00:08:14,109 --> 00:08:17,922
at a fixed point, and time...

154
00:08:17,946 --> 00:08:19,257
kills you.

155
00:08:19,281 --> 00:08:20,892
Time can do that?

156
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:23,928
No one's ever even made it
to the last assassin.

157
00:08:23,952 --> 00:08:27,966
But if you're so determined,
you're in the queue,

158
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:31,370
and by the look of today's competitors,

159
00:08:31,394 --> 00:08:33,424
your turn will be up soon.

160
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,431
All right, Gwyn,

161
00:08:43,455 --> 00:08:45,130
if we're gonna save Alun,
we have to be smart.

162
00:08:45,154 --> 00:08:46,565
We can't cause any ripples
that might affect

163
00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:48,201
- the larger timeline.
- I understand.

164
00:08:48,225 --> 00:08:50,296
And I have to say,
I am mightily appreciative

165
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,766
that you've changed
your mind on this, Miss Sharpe.

166
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,300
- Thank you.
- We would be dead

167
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:54,803
if it weren't for you.
We can give you this.

168
00:08:54,827 --> 00:08:57,476
My divine mission is almost complete.

169
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,481
Now let me show you.

170
00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:00,482
This is where Alun was ambushed.

171
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:02,070
Oh, perfect. Here you go.

172
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,616
- Oh, little soldiers.
- Yes.

173
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,717
I found them in the attic.

174
00:09:06,741 --> 00:09:08,253
Constantine was a bit of a hoarder.

175
00:09:08,277 --> 00:09:10,588
Ooh, seems like a very peculiar fellow.

176
00:09:10,612 --> 00:09:12,042
- Mr. Green!
- Hm?

177
00:09:13,282 --> 00:09:14,425
What? Is the Waverider here?

178
00:09:14,449 --> 00:09:15,430
Uh, not yet.

179
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:18,156
I'm just here to drop off
Gwyn's time machine.

180
00:09:19,821 --> 00:09:21,799
Astra said it should change back soon.

181
00:09:21,823 --> 00:09:23,335
Well, I'll assume that
that makes sense then.

182
00:09:23,359 --> 00:09:24,470
No, that makes absolutely no sense.

183
00:09:24,494 --> 00:09:25,605
What happened with the archduke?

184
00:09:25,629 --> 00:09:27,374
Oh, we're still waiting our turn

185
00:09:27,398 --> 00:09:30,608
in a sort of time travel
"Cheers" meets Thunder Dome.

186
00:09:30,632 --> 00:09:33,011
- What's a Thunder Dome?
- Uh, you don't want to know.

187
00:09:33,035 --> 00:09:35,313
- Wait, stop, is everyone, uh...
- No, no, we're fine.

188
00:09:35,337 --> 00:09:38,315
We're fine. It's a pub
filled with time travelers.

189
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:39,783
Yeah, people like us

190
00:09:39,807 --> 00:09:41,551
who are there to save the archduke.

191
00:09:41,575 --> 00:09:43,487
A whole community of time travelers

192
00:09:43,511 --> 00:09:45,622
all with the same aim and purpose.

193
00:09:45,646 --> 00:09:47,424
Wow, Gwyn, none of this

194
00:09:47,448 --> 00:09:49,948
would exist without your invention.

195
00:09:51,585 --> 00:09:53,697
Wait a s... uh-oh.

196
00:09:53,721 --> 00:09:55,865
None of this would exist
without your invention,

197
00:09:55,889 --> 00:09:57,135
which means if we go on to save Alun,

198
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:58,470
you never invent time travel,
which means

199
00:09:58,494 --> 00:09:59,505
no Waverider, no Legends.

200
00:09:59,529 --> 00:10:01,210
And no one to go back to save Alun

201
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:02,945
in the first place?

202
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:05,309
Ah, I can't deal with
all these time loops

203
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:06,677
and paradoxes all in one day.

204
00:10:06,701 --> 00:10:09,245
I'm just gonna leave this in the foyer.

205
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:12,114
Okay, okay, okay,
so, uh, it's not as simple

206
00:10:12,138 --> 00:10:13,517
as saving Alun from the Germans, right?

207
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:14,984
But we just have to
make sure that you go on

208
00:10:15,008 --> 00:10:15,989
to invent time travel.

209
00:10:16,013 --> 00:10:18,021
Oh, I've already
solved that, Miss Sharpe.

210
00:10:18,045 --> 00:10:20,724
You see, my mission is to save Alun.

211
00:10:20,748 --> 00:10:23,693
However, my younger self
must never find out.

212
00:10:23,717 --> 00:10:26,318
I must always end up here.

213
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,965
What? But...

214
00:10:28,989 --> 00:10:31,300
that means he'd be out
there alive, and you'd be...

215
00:10:31,324 --> 00:10:33,436
Alone.

216
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:36,909
So let me show you
where he was ambushed.

217
00:10:36,933 --> 00:10:38,900
Time is killing people?

218
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,445
I don't even understand
how time can have this power.

219
00:10:42,469 --> 00:10:43,680
But I suppose I've never questioned

220
00:10:43,704 --> 00:10:45,315
what made a fixed point fixed.

221
00:10:45,339 --> 00:10:47,884
Who knew time travel
could be this complicated?

222
00:10:47,908 --> 00:10:48,919
I don't know how you've wrapped

223
00:10:48,943 --> 00:10:50,954
your human brains around it
all these years.

224
00:10:50,978 --> 00:10:53,322
Oh, wait. Yes, I do.

225
00:10:53,346 --> 00:10:55,080
I need a drink.

226
00:10:56,816 --> 00:10:58,393
Hey, I mean, we could grab a...

227
00:10:58,417 --> 00:10:59,896
Do you want to go check out
the betting tables?

228
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,653
- You bet.
- Right, well, I'll see you.

229
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:06,868
I mean, we could hang out or something.

230
00:11:06,892 --> 00:11:08,103
Unless you have some plans.

231
00:11:08,127 --> 00:11:10,372
No, yeah, we, uh...

232
00:11:10,396 --> 00:11:14,376
you know, we have never
done the one-on-one...

233
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,543
thing.

234
00:11:15,567 --> 00:11:17,312
Yeah. We should... after you.

235
00:11:17,336 --> 00:11:18,981
- O-okay, I'll go.
- Okay.

236
00:11:19,005 --> 00:11:21,149
Ah, what can I get you folks?

237
00:11:21,173 --> 00:11:24,253
Two stouts, please. Anything for you?

238
00:11:24,277 --> 00:11:28,282
Oh, uh, I'll just have the one.

239
00:11:29,415 --> 00:11:30,547
Thank you.

240
00:11:32,685 --> 00:11:34,797
Now, when you say time's
out there killing people,

241
00:11:34,821 --> 00:11:36,398
like, you can't mean literally,

242
00:11:36,422 --> 00:11:38,100
'cause that doesn't make any sense.

243
00:11:38,124 --> 00:11:39,934
Well, I know it's a lot to take in,

244
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:42,170
but you've gotta trust me on this one.

245
00:11:42,194 --> 00:11:44,106
I've been in the time travel game

246
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:47,442
for a long... time.

247
00:11:47,466 --> 00:11:49,377
Oh, you've been in it for a long time.

248
00:11:49,401 --> 00:11:51,646
Okay, well, then I guess
that makes you the authority.

249
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,936
Well...

250
00:11:53,539 --> 00:11:56,784
I guess that does
make you the authority.

251
00:11:56,808 --> 00:11:57,952
All these years,

252
00:11:57,976 --> 00:11:59,689
I never even knew
the fixed point had a bar.

253
00:11:59,713 --> 00:12:01,457
Oh, don't be too hard on yourself.

254
00:12:01,481 --> 00:12:04,259
It's always been
a word-of-mouth kinda place,

255
00:12:04,283 --> 00:12:05,927
and besides, you're young.

256
00:12:05,951 --> 00:12:09,419
You can't expect to know
all there is to know.

257
00:12:10,788 --> 00:12:12,365
You're right.

258
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:14,134
Here I am thinking
I've infinite knowledge,

259
00:12:14,158 --> 00:12:16,470
but, I mean, what do I know?
What do I know, Gary?

260
00:12:16,494 --> 00:12:18,172
Hmm? Okay, for example, okay,

261
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:21,242
what is a... a pickleback, hm?

262
00:12:21,266 --> 00:12:24,066
Oh, does that come in large?

263
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:29,115
This is... this is great.

264
00:12:29,139 --> 00:12:30,284
Right?

265
00:12:30,308 --> 00:12:32,753
I mean, this is great.

266
00:12:32,777 --> 00:12:35,322
I mean, like, us. Finally.

267
00:12:35,346 --> 00:12:36,923
Right? I... Yeah.

268
00:12:36,947 --> 00:12:39,392
You know, it usually gets
so crazy around here,

269
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:42,996
we never get a chance to just... hang.

270
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,632
Totally, totally.

271
00:12:44,656 --> 00:12:47,234
Yeah, 'cause, you know,
what... what people do together

272
00:12:47,258 --> 00:12:49,869
is they...

273
00:12:49,893 --> 00:12:51,004
they talk.

274
00:12:51,028 --> 00:12:52,891
- Yeah. Yes.
- Right? About...

275
00:12:55,932 --> 00:12:56,943
Topics.

276
00:12:56,967 --> 00:12:58,211
Right. Yes, yes.

277
00:12:58,235 --> 00:12:59,946
I mean, we all love topics, right?

278
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:03,037
I mean, you know, there's...
there's things like...

279
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,051
Makeup.

280
00:13:06,075 --> 00:13:07,619
- Right, yeah?
- Ah, I do.

281
00:13:07,643 --> 00:13:09,722
Yeah, I like makeup, but, you know,

282
00:13:09,746 --> 00:13:12,757
we can also talk about, uh...

283
00:13:12,781 --> 00:13:13,892
guns.

284
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:16,014
Yeah. Yeah, we could.

285
00:13:17,353 --> 00:13:18,449
Yeah.

286
00:13:22,258 --> 00:13:25,670
The second assassin
is this salt shaker, okay?

287
00:13:25,694 --> 00:13:28,007
Now, he'll get distracted
when this motorcade...

288
00:13:28,031 --> 00:13:29,341
Okay, wait, wait, wait. I got it.

289
00:13:29,365 --> 00:13:30,876
I got the plan that not even time

290
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:34,480
is going to see coming.
A true Legends plan.

291
00:13:34,504 --> 00:13:36,048
No. No way!

292
00:13:36,072 --> 00:13:38,484
Are you... are you guys
the Legends Of Tomorrow?

293
00:13:38,508 --> 00:13:41,921
It makes sense we'd be known
around these parts, I guess.

294
00:13:41,945 --> 00:13:43,641
We get around.

295
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,796
Yeah, a bunch of washed-up superheroes

296
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:54,666
who think they can beat
the fixed point... cute.

297
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:56,734
Okay. Calm down.

298
00:13:56,758 --> 00:13:59,122
We are basically the same age as you.

299
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:05,165
Sick burn!

300
00:14:06,301 --> 00:14:07,611
Oh, he said that you...

301
00:14:07,635 --> 00:14:09,280
No one cares what he said, all right?

302
00:14:09,304 --> 00:14:11,382
Why don't you guys go giggle
at your own table?

303
00:14:11,406 --> 00:14:13,117
'Cause we have adult things to do.

304
00:14:13,141 --> 00:14:15,638
- Wow, aggressive.
- Okay, sorry.

305
00:14:17,212 --> 00:14:19,490
Number 71.

306
00:14:19,514 --> 00:14:21,225
Okay, all right.

307
00:14:21,249 --> 00:14:22,927
- Forget those guys...
- Yeah.

308
00:14:22,951 --> 00:14:24,163
Because they do not matter.

309
00:14:24,187 --> 00:14:26,030
All that matters is our plan.

310
00:14:26,054 --> 00:14:27,165
- Hear me out.
- Go.

311
00:14:27,189 --> 00:14:28,833
Three assassins fan out.

312
00:14:28,857 --> 00:14:30,135
I follow the guy with the grenade.

313
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:32,171
Then here, I untie the dog

314
00:14:32,195 --> 00:14:33,306
that's tied to the lamp pole...

315
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,540
And it knocks off the steak

316
00:14:34,564 --> 00:14:35,970
from the table at the corner café?

317
00:14:35,994 --> 00:14:38,445
Exactly, and then I use that...

318
00:14:38,469 --> 00:14:40,644
As a distraction to steal the bike?

319
00:14:40,668 --> 00:14:43,013
Yeah, you got it. How do you know this?

320
00:14:43,037 --> 00:14:45,568
He's doing it right now.

321
00:14:46,941 --> 00:14:48,551
Okay, well, whatever,

322
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:51,154
because my plan has a second steak

323
00:14:51,178 --> 00:14:53,623
that I will slip into the
assassin's pocket...

324
00:14:53,647 --> 00:14:56,226
and that's exactly what he's doing?

325
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,061
Really? No.

326
00:14:58,085 --> 00:14:59,415
No!

327
00:15:01,589 --> 00:15:04,856
And another one bites the dust.

328
00:15:05,793 --> 00:15:07,371
- Okay.
- Mm.

329
00:15:07,395 --> 00:15:10,540
Okay. Hey, this is a good
thing because now we know

330
00:15:10,564 --> 00:15:13,743
this plan is no good.
On to the next plan.

331
00:15:13,767 --> 00:15:15,979
72.

332
00:15:16,003 --> 00:15:18,148
Lance...

333
00:15:18,172 --> 00:15:20,284
you're up.

334
00:15:20,308 --> 00:15:23,875
Hey, if you need more time,
we can get it.

335
00:15:27,414 --> 00:15:29,326
I got this.

336
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:33,529
Improvising is what I do best, right?

337
00:15:33,553 --> 00:15:36,198
Let's see what you got, old-timer.

338
00:15:36,222 --> 00:15:37,921
Hey.

339
00:15:40,126 --> 00:15:41,889
You're Sara damn Lance.

340
00:15:59,345 --> 00:16:02,377
With Sara out there, they
won't make it past the tavern.

341
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:11,656
Damn it.

342
00:16:13,058 --> 00:16:14,502
All right, well, maybe...

343
00:16:14,526 --> 00:16:16,190
maybe she's got something else planned.

344
00:16:36,615 --> 00:16:38,181
Wait.

345
00:16:48,293 --> 00:16:50,760
At least her comedic timing
is impeccable.

346
00:17:02,942 --> 00:17:04,887
There she is.

347
00:17:04,911 --> 00:17:06,388
Bobby, baby.

348
00:17:06,412 --> 00:17:07,956
Valiant attempt, Captain.

349
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:10,425
Look, I'm sorry, guys.
I froze out there.

350
00:17:10,449 --> 00:17:11,994
I didn't know my next move. I just...

351
00:17:12,018 --> 00:17:14,182
- It wasn't that bad.
- No one noticed.

352
00:17:16,022 --> 00:17:19,167
Y'all... y'all feel
a shift in the timeline?

353
00:17:19,191 --> 00:17:20,702
You know what? Yeah, I did.

354
00:17:20,726 --> 00:17:22,103
Now the assassination's only

355
00:17:22,127 --> 00:17:24,539
the second most epic tragedy
to happen today.

356
00:17:24,563 --> 00:17:27,594
All right, all right.
At least I survived, okay?

357
00:17:36,242 --> 00:17:37,874
Okay, um...

358
00:17:41,146 --> 00:17:42,979
I'm gonna get a drink.

359
00:17:48,854 --> 00:17:51,499
No, if we just
divert the Germans here...

360
00:17:51,523 --> 00:17:52,600
This isn't working.

361
00:17:52,624 --> 00:17:53,935
Oh, but it will now if you look at...

362
00:17:53,959 --> 00:17:55,837
No, it's not good enough, Gwyn.

363
00:17:55,861 --> 00:17:58,172
The plan can't be for you
to live your life heartbroken.

364
00:17:58,196 --> 00:18:00,408
I mean, there has to be
a solve for this.

365
00:18:00,432 --> 00:18:01,531
There's...

366
00:18:03,697 --> 00:18:06,777
What if, uh, what if I take
each of the Legends

367
00:18:06,801 --> 00:18:08,282
and I place them
in different points in time?

368
00:18:08,306 --> 00:18:09,884
- No, we shouldn't do that.
- No, no, no, wait, wait, wait.

369
00:18:09,908 --> 00:18:11,708
- I'm onto something here.
- Now, Miss Sharpe!

370
00:18:13,078 --> 00:18:15,456
My sorry fate... it isn't just a solve

371
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,725
for the paradox, you see.

372
00:18:17,749 --> 00:18:19,715
It's what I deserve...

373
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:23,164
For loving Alun in the first place.

374
00:18:23,188 --> 00:18:26,166
Gwyn...

375
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,735
there's nothing wrong
with you loving another man.

376
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:30,570
Now, that might be easy
for you to say, Miss Sharp.

377
00:18:30,594 --> 00:18:32,906
But it's true. It's true.

378
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:35,773
Listen, I'm so, so sorry
that you have had

379
00:18:35,797 --> 00:18:38,378
to live your life
hiding who you really are.

380
00:18:38,402 --> 00:18:41,447
But I... I promise you
that there are places

381
00:18:41,471 --> 00:18:43,783
where you can feel safe to be yourself

382
00:18:43,807 --> 00:18:46,841
- where people will accept you...
- It is not about the people.

383
00:18:48,145 --> 00:18:52,350
It doesn't matter if I'm
accepted by others, you see.

384
00:18:52,983 --> 00:18:55,948
I will never be accepted by God.

385
00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:01,968
You see, my love for Alun, it, uh...

386
00:19:01,992 --> 00:19:05,457
it goes against who God wants me to be.

387
00:19:07,064 --> 00:19:09,376
It may be my divine mission
to save Alun,

388
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,045
but it must also be my divine punishment

389
00:19:12,069 --> 00:19:14,480
to live without him.

390
00:19:14,504 --> 00:19:17,268
- And that's the plan, okay?
- No.

391
00:19:25,114 --> 00:19:27,078
Hey, watch out for the ladder, sis!

392
00:19:29,552 --> 00:19:31,863
I can't stand people like that.

393
00:19:31,887 --> 00:19:33,265
Yeah, me either.

394
00:19:33,289 --> 00:19:35,300
It's like they're always
playing these tough guys.

395
00:19:35,324 --> 00:19:37,824
Yeah, they think they're
better than everyone else.

396
00:19:39,395 --> 00:19:43,208
Wait, I can talk about
people I don't like

397
00:19:43,232 --> 00:19:44,709
literally all day.

398
00:19:44,733 --> 00:19:47,212
Right, yeah, you know,
and guys like them

399
00:19:47,236 --> 00:19:48,981
is why I stopped
going to places like this.

400
00:19:49,005 --> 00:19:50,882
- Yeah.
- Well, that and, you know,

401
00:19:50,906 --> 00:19:52,837
I kinda got abducted by a timeship.

402
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:56,322
You know what? So did I, actually.

403
00:19:56,346 --> 00:19:58,112
So did I.

404
00:20:01,717 --> 00:20:04,996
Why was it so hard for us
to do this before?

405
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,832
I thought you didn't like me.

406
00:20:07,856 --> 00:20:09,287
Wow.

407
00:20:10,092 --> 00:20:11,936
You know, I always figured

408
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,105
you thought you were better than me.

409
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:18,242
No. I am so intimidated by you.

410
00:20:18,266 --> 00:20:19,277
- Shut up.
- Yeah.

411
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,282
- No.
- Yeah.

412
00:20:20,306 --> 00:20:22,184
I'm... okay, I'm the one
that's intimidated by you.

413
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:23,841
- Get out of here!
- Yeah.

414
00:20:29,344 --> 00:20:32,023
Hey, sorry about back there.

415
00:20:32,047 --> 00:20:34,626
The team really didn't
put on the best front.

416
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,127
Yeah, well, they trusted me.

417
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:38,964
I told them to trust me,
and then I get out there,

418
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:40,899
and I don't even know
what the hell I'm doing.

419
00:20:40,923 --> 00:20:42,634
Hey, so you got a case of the yips.

420
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,836
It happens to the best of us.

421
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:48,006
Besides, changing a fixed point
isn't supposed to be easy.

422
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:50,108
It's not just the fixed point.

423
00:20:50,132 --> 00:20:53,744
It's this whole damn road trip
or whatever the hell we're on.

424
00:20:53,768 --> 00:20:57,773
- Sara, we got this far.
- Yeah, and where are we?

425
00:20:58,306 --> 00:20:59,817
Seriously, where are we?

426
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:03,709
Running for our lives with
no home, with no plan?

427
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:09,700
I feel like I used to always
know what the next move was,

428
00:21:09,724 --> 00:21:11,688
and now it's like...

429
00:21:13,061 --> 00:21:16,329
I don't know. Nothing...
nothing's working.

430
00:21:19,994 --> 00:21:23,041
Look, we got this far because of you.

431
00:21:23,065 --> 00:21:24,442
And if it weren't for you,

432
00:21:24,466 --> 00:21:26,677
we'd still be in Odessa making headlines

433
00:21:26,701 --> 00:21:29,414
while the FBI shuts down our circus.

434
00:21:29,438 --> 00:21:31,015
Would have been a good circus.

435
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,417
Would have been a great circus.

436
00:21:32,441 --> 00:21:34,318
- Yeah.
- But you know what?

437
00:21:34,342 --> 00:21:35,885
It's not all on you.

438
00:21:35,909 --> 00:21:38,255
Yeah, I mean, you may be indestructible,

439
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:40,390
but don't mean you got to go it alone.

440
00:21:40,414 --> 00:21:41,395
That's right.

441
00:21:41,419 --> 00:21:43,860
This time, we'll go out there with you.

442
00:21:43,884 --> 00:21:45,795
You guys I... look, I appreciate it.

443
00:21:45,819 --> 00:21:48,265
I really do, but I can't
put you in danger,

444
00:21:48,289 --> 00:21:52,057
and we don't even have a plan.

445
00:21:53,094 --> 00:21:56,473
Exactly.
We don't need a perfect plan.

446
00:21:56,497 --> 00:21:58,007
We're the Legends Of Tomorrow.

447
00:21:58,031 --> 00:22:00,810
We got something
those hotshots don't have.

448
00:22:00,834 --> 00:22:04,266
That's experience...
experience at failing.

449
00:22:08,342 --> 00:22:09,786
Ah, you know what?

450
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:13,778
We've broken time before.
Let's do it again.

451
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,311
Since I'm the only one
who can "Live Die Repeat"...

452
00:22:21,335 --> 00:22:22,545
"Live Die Repeat"?

453
00:22:22,569 --> 00:22:24,147
It's a reference to this time loop movie

454
00:22:24,171 --> 00:22:25,376
that's so fire.

455
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,674
I'll show it to you when
we get the Waverider back.

456
00:22:27,698 --> 00:22:30,276
So I'll just keep going
out there again and again

457
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,812
until we figure out
the best way to beat time.

458
00:22:32,836 --> 00:22:34,713
And when you do fail, no offense,

459
00:22:34,737 --> 00:22:36,182
we'll be there every step of the way

460
00:22:36,206 --> 00:22:37,684
during the assassination from the time

461
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:39,285
the Black Hand shows up to the taverns

462
00:22:39,309 --> 00:22:40,753
to the time Princip takes the shot.

463
00:22:40,777 --> 00:22:43,255
Spoons and I can take
the tavern, if that's okay.

464
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:44,724
- Yeah, I'm down.
- Cool.

465
00:22:44,748 --> 00:22:46,492
Great, and then
the rest of us will watch

466
00:22:46,516 --> 00:22:49,028
from the outskirts,
analyze your mistakes,

467
00:22:49,052 --> 00:22:50,796
and come up with some
new strategies, huh?

468
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,583
Ooh, like a sideline of coaches.

469
00:22:53,656 --> 00:22:56,224
Number 78.

470
00:23:19,949 --> 00:23:21,012
God!

471
00:23:25,621 --> 00:23:29,020
Sometimes the best play is a trick play.

472
00:23:35,598 --> 00:23:37,197
Looking for this?

473
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:40,698
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

474
00:23:41,771 --> 00:23:43,534
All right. Two to go, Sara.

475
00:24:12,734 --> 00:24:15,101
You call that a knife?

476
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:19,235
Now, that's a knife.

477
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:24,310
Looking for this?

478
00:24:29,883 --> 00:24:31,495
- Yes!
- Yes!

479
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:34,398
One more assassin to stop.
Come on, Sara.

480
00:24:34,422 --> 00:24:35,799
They got to Princip.

481
00:24:35,823 --> 00:24:38,421
No one's ever made it that far.

482
00:25:00,747 --> 00:25:02,558
No, wait, no, no, no,
look, it wasn't me.

483
00:25:02,582 --> 00:25:03,745
I didn't...

484
00:25:51,431 --> 00:25:53,442
Well, well, well,

485
00:25:53,466 --> 00:25:56,364
if it ain't the failures
of tomorrow failing again.

486
00:25:58,805 --> 00:26:00,448
Stupid kids.

487
00:26:00,472 --> 00:26:02,851
Well, we may be failing,

488
00:26:02,875 --> 00:26:05,621
but at least we're failing together.

489
00:26:05,645 --> 00:26:08,356
Yeah, and we're learning, too, right?

490
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,391
You know what, a couple more times,

491
00:26:09,415 --> 00:26:10,493
and we're gonna figure this out.

492
00:26:10,517 --> 00:26:11,498
Yeah, well, we got to hurry

493
00:26:11,522 --> 00:26:13,514
because we only have two tickets left.

494
00:26:19,291 --> 00:26:22,103
I think we have a few minutes
before the next try.

495
00:26:22,127 --> 00:26:25,640
So smash, marry, kill.

496
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:27,895
Nate, Gwyn, Gary?

497
00:26:31,036 --> 00:26:33,670
No, not... not... not really
into any of them.

498
00:26:34,573 --> 00:26:38,778
Copy, okay, how about Sara, Ava, Astra?

499
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:43,913
Not... not... not really
into any of them either.

500
00:26:44,716 --> 00:26:47,417
Also copy. Okay.

501
00:26:48,454 --> 00:26:50,187
What is your type?

502
00:26:50,789 --> 00:26:52,300
You know, I don't really

503
00:26:52,324 --> 00:26:54,791
get those types of feelings for anyone.

504
00:26:56,027 --> 00:26:59,906
Maybe it's one of those things
those mushroom aliens

505
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:02,243
messed up about me, huh?

506
00:27:02,267 --> 00:27:04,044
Hey, no, no, no.

507
00:27:04,068 --> 00:27:06,547
What you're describing
is totally normal.

508
00:27:06,571 --> 00:27:09,572
It just means maybe you're "Ace".

509
00:27:10,875 --> 00:27:13,654
Asexual, people who identify as Ace

510
00:27:13,678 --> 00:27:15,456
have little or no interest in sex

511
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,959
but many of them still want
to be in relationships.

512
00:27:18,983 --> 00:27:21,584
Wow, uh...

513
00:27:24,789 --> 00:27:27,022
I guess that makes me Ace.

514
00:27:28,259 --> 00:27:30,726
OMG, did you just come out to me?

515
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:35,342
- I guess I did.
- Yeah.

516
00:27:35,366 --> 00:27:37,210
Okay, well, okay, first of all,

517
00:27:37,234 --> 00:27:41,014
who would have thought you'd be
the first person I'd tell?

518
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:42,516
- Not me.
- Okay.

519
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,604
Cheers.

520
00:27:45,443 --> 00:27:47,287
Hey, what's so funny?

521
00:27:47,311 --> 00:27:48,621
Nothing.

522
00:27:48,645 --> 00:27:51,209
I guess... I guess you had to be there.

523
00:27:53,817 --> 00:27:55,361
Cool. Cool.

524
00:27:55,385 --> 00:27:57,830
Okay, copy that.

525
00:27:57,854 --> 00:27:59,721
- We should go over here.
- Yeah.

526
00:28:03,193 --> 00:28:05,070
Well, what about you, Z?

527
00:28:05,094 --> 00:28:08,693
Well, besides broody wizards,
what's your type?

528
00:28:11,301 --> 00:28:13,735
What about that guy with the top hat?

529
00:28:16,273 --> 00:28:17,869
What guy with the top hat?

530
00:28:22,311 --> 00:28:24,657
Hey, gang, we were just in the tavern,

531
00:28:24,681 --> 00:28:26,258
and Spooner saw this guy in a top hat,

532
00:28:26,282 --> 00:28:28,060
but when I turned to look
at him, he disappeared.

533
00:28:28,084 --> 00:28:29,829
Yeah, so we walked over
to where he was standing,

534
00:28:29,853 --> 00:28:32,564
and my bad guy radar went off, big time.

535
00:28:32,588 --> 00:28:33,866
- A man in a top hat?
- Yeah.

536
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:36,869
And I swear I've seen
him along the route.

537
00:28:36,893 --> 00:28:38,990
Maybe he's on the film.

538
00:28:46,269 --> 00:28:48,047
Stop. There.

539
00:28:48,071 --> 00:28:49,436
Rewind the film.

540
00:28:51,574 --> 00:28:52,940
Stop.

541
00:28:54,577 --> 00:28:56,377
Can you go to the next frame?

542
00:28:58,848 --> 00:29:02,027
Hm, he's only in that one frame.

543
00:29:02,051 --> 00:29:03,162
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

544
00:29:03,186 --> 00:29:05,064
He appears right before
Sara makes a move,

545
00:29:05,088 --> 00:29:06,698
and then he disappears, so maybe...

546
00:29:06,722 --> 00:29:10,202
It's not time fixing itself.

547
00:29:10,226 --> 00:29:12,260
It's a person.

548
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:19,148
So it's a person fixing time,

549
00:29:19,172 --> 00:29:21,150
not actually time like we thought.

550
00:29:21,174 --> 00:29:23,753
Yes! I knew it!

551
00:29:23,777 --> 00:29:25,688
Did I do that right?

552
00:29:25,712 --> 00:29:27,890
Sorry, I'm just relieved that
it's a person and not time.

553
00:29:27,914 --> 00:29:30,326
Existential crisis averted. Carry on.

554
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:32,695
All right, so we got
to figure out how Mr. Peanut

555
00:29:32,719 --> 00:29:35,420
keeps fixing time, then disappearing.

556
00:29:38,258 --> 00:29:41,326
It is like he's stopping time.

557
00:29:44,297 --> 00:29:45,742
What if he is?

558
00:29:45,766 --> 00:29:48,645
Breakthrough. Sara's
having a breakthrough.

559
00:29:48,669 --> 00:29:52,115
What is this top hat guy
has the ability to freeze time?

560
00:29:52,139 --> 00:29:55,917
And then he fixes the timeline,
and then he restarts it

561
00:29:55,941 --> 00:29:57,753
without anyone knowing he was there.

562
00:29:57,777 --> 00:30:00,288
- Called it.
- Nice.

563
00:30:00,312 --> 00:30:02,090
Right, how are we supposed
to beat someone

564
00:30:02,114 --> 00:30:03,759
who can freeze freaking time?

565
00:30:03,783 --> 00:30:05,894
I mean, I just wish there was some way

566
00:30:05,918 --> 00:30:09,798
you could be invulnerable
to his time-freezing powers.

567
00:30:09,822 --> 00:30:11,789
Well, there is one way.

568
00:30:13,459 --> 00:30:16,037
Dr. Davies, do you think
you could let us borrow

569
00:30:16,061 --> 00:30:17,706
the CR-055 superconductor?

570
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:20,108
The CR-055 superconductor?

571
00:30:20,132 --> 00:30:21,777
Well, what would you want that for then?

572
00:30:21,801 --> 00:30:23,845
To build an anti-time manipulator.

573
00:30:23,869 --> 00:30:25,714
What do you need
an anti-time manipulator for?

574
00:30:25,738 --> 00:30:28,149
Well, my plan to change
the fixed point has led us

575
00:30:28,173 --> 00:30:31,286
to a mysterious bad guy
who can stop time.

576
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:34,021
Well, I would very much like
to help you, Miss Gideon,

577
00:30:34,045 --> 00:30:36,791
but that would mean completely
dismantling my time machine,

578
00:30:36,815 --> 00:30:38,726
not to mention risk never saving Alun

579
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:40,951
if I can't put it back together again.

580
00:30:44,656 --> 00:30:47,702
But...

581
00:30:47,726 --> 00:30:51,739
maybe this is part
of God's plan after all,

582
00:30:51,763 --> 00:30:55,495
and I have always
been destined to fail him.

583
00:31:02,007 --> 00:31:04,674
Gwyn, wait. Hey.

584
00:31:06,177 --> 00:31:08,655
Look, I understand that
you have a deep faith in God.

585
00:31:08,679 --> 00:31:11,993
I do, and I don't know
what that feels like, okay?

586
00:31:12,017 --> 00:31:15,295
But I do know that
if... if there is a God,

587
00:31:15,319 --> 00:31:20,162
he or she or they... or
whatever pronoun they prefer...

588
00:31:20,186 --> 00:31:25,372
would... would want you
to experience love, you know,

589
00:31:25,396 --> 00:31:27,908
and to feel acceptance

590
00:31:27,932 --> 00:31:31,178
loving whoever it is you choose, Gwyn,

591
00:31:31,202 --> 00:31:33,848
because love is love

592
00:31:33,872 --> 00:31:38,077
is love is love is love is love is love.

593
00:31:41,311 --> 00:31:44,590
That was profoundly
beautiful, Miss Sharpe.

594
00:31:44,614 --> 00:31:46,126
I didn't know you're a poet.

595
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:47,260
No, I'm not actually.

596
00:31:47,284 --> 00:31:49,496
That... that last part
is Lin-Manuel Miranda

597
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,501
I don't know him.

598
00:31:50,525 --> 00:31:54,805
What I'm trying to say
is that you deserve love, Gwyn.

599
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:59,034
You are a good man, okay?

600
00:31:59,863 --> 00:32:01,808
Now that you have
the Legends behind you,

601
00:32:01,832 --> 00:32:05,411
I promise you we will
do whatever it takes

602
00:32:05,435 --> 00:32:08,504
to make sure that you can be with Alun.

603
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,507
It moves me to know that.

604
00:32:13,611 --> 00:32:16,611
What moves me even more is...

605
00:32:17,247 --> 00:32:19,159
your unrelenting belief

606
00:32:19,183 --> 00:32:22,247
- that there is a way.
- Always.

607
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:28,355
I thank you for that, Miss Sharpe.

608
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,471
Come here.

609
00:32:32,495 --> 00:32:36,575
- Oh, yes, okay.
- It's gonna be okay.

610
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:38,599
I'm a hugger.

611
00:32:39,802 --> 00:32:42,002
I guess I'm a hugger too now as well.

612
00:32:45,108 --> 00:32:47,152
May we introduce
the anti-time manipulator.

613
00:32:47,176 --> 00:32:49,088
Now, do be expeditious, Miss Lance.

614
00:32:49,112 --> 00:32:50,488
You see, there is only enough power

615
00:32:50,512 --> 00:32:52,725
to shield you from times stopping once.

616
00:32:52,749 --> 00:32:54,727
Okay. No pressure.

617
00:32:54,751 --> 00:32:55,962
- Oh, there's pressure.
- Lots of pressure.

618
00:32:55,986 --> 00:32:57,797
Loads and loads of pressure.

619
00:32:57,821 --> 00:32:59,099
Yeah, okay. Thanks.

620
00:32:59,123 --> 00:33:00,588
- You're welcome.
- Very welcome.

621
00:33:02,424 --> 00:33:05,422
Uh-uh-uh-uh. Ticket.

622
00:33:07,797 --> 00:33:08,974
No one?

623
00:33:08,998 --> 00:33:10,142
There's no more.

624
00:33:10,166 --> 00:33:11,744
We don't have any more.

625
00:33:11,768 --> 00:33:14,246
I'm sorry, but rules are rules.

626
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:16,381
Here.

627
00:33:16,405 --> 00:33:18,216
Take ours before we change our minds.

628
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,018
These should come in handy too.

629
00:33:21,042 --> 00:33:24,121
Comms? Hell yeah.

630
00:33:24,145 --> 00:33:26,825
Wait, why do you guys want to help us?

631
00:33:26,849 --> 00:33:28,793
I thought we were
a bunch of old geezers, huh?

632
00:33:28,817 --> 00:33:30,395
Yeah, sorry about that.

633
00:33:30,419 --> 00:33:32,997
We tend to lash out
when we feel threatened.

634
00:33:33,021 --> 00:33:35,700
Yeah, we've been working out
our issues in group therapy.

635
00:33:35,724 --> 00:33:36,735
Nice.

636
00:33:36,759 --> 00:33:39,771
Anyways, you guys still
look like you've got it,

637
00:33:39,795 --> 00:33:42,106
and this might be
your biggest legend yet.

638
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:44,398
So, please.

639
00:33:46,669 --> 00:33:50,637
Thank you. We only need one.

640
00:33:51,807 --> 00:33:55,687
Take a chance on Sara Lance!
Take a chance on Sara lance!

641
00:33:55,711 --> 00:33:57,789
Take a chance on Sara Lance!

642
00:33:57,813 --> 00:33:59,757
Take a chance on Sara Lance!

643
00:33:59,781 --> 00:34:03,727
Take a chance on Sara Lance!
Take a chance on Sara Lance!

644
00:34:03,751 --> 00:34:07,317
- Go, Sara!
- Yeah!

645
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,357
I got eyes on the prize.

646
00:34:16,964 --> 00:34:18,260
Hey.

647
00:34:23,838 --> 00:34:26,983
Sara Lance!
Take a chance on Sara Lance!

648
00:34:27,007 --> 00:34:28,819
Take a chance on Sara Lance!

649
00:34:28,843 --> 00:34:31,708
Take a chance on Sara Lance.

650
00:34:37,751 --> 00:34:39,715
Here goes everything.

651
00:35:08,482 --> 00:35:09,748
Thawne?

652
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:13,262
Big twist, I know.

653
00:35:13,286 --> 00:35:15,364
Who would have thought me of all people

654
00:35:15,388 --> 00:35:19,023
would be here protecting the timeline?

655
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,511
How the hell are you not frozen?

656
00:35:26,535 --> 00:35:28,113
I'm sorry.

657
00:35:28,137 --> 00:35:29,814
I can't take you seriously in that hat.

658
00:35:29,838 --> 00:35:31,182
You look like a railroad villain.

659
00:35:31,206 --> 00:35:36,040
Ah, yeah, well, can a
railroad villain do this?

660
00:35:44,986 --> 00:35:46,516
What happened to your supper speed?

661
00:35:49,558 --> 00:35:52,002
Long story. Give it up, Sara.

662
00:35:52,026 --> 00:35:53,824
You can never defeat a fixed point.

663
00:36:00,836 --> 00:36:01,865
Have you met me?

664
00:36:12,446 --> 00:36:16,114
Just surrender or die again.

665
00:36:16,917 --> 00:36:19,195
Surrender isn't an option.

666
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:22,599
I've sworn to protect
the fixed point at all costs.

667
00:36:22,623 --> 00:36:23,900
So when you kill me,

668
00:36:23,924 --> 00:36:25,402
you better be ready to take my place,

669
00:36:25,426 --> 00:36:27,993
or all reality will fall apart.

670
00:36:29,964 --> 00:36:33,042
Look, I'm not trying to break reality,

671
00:36:33,066 --> 00:36:35,044
and I definitely don't want
to take your place.

672
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:39,048
- Then why are you doing this?
- It's a long story.

673
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:42,307
Well, we have all the time
in the world it seems.

674
00:36:44,512 --> 00:36:47,155
Fine. Let's do this differently.

675
00:36:47,179 --> 00:36:49,414
Care for a drink?

676
00:36:54,153 --> 00:36:56,321
First off, how?

677
00:36:58,057 --> 00:36:59,368
Here's the deal.

678
00:36:59,392 --> 00:37:01,704
Every day is the same day.

679
00:37:01,728 --> 00:37:06,614
I wake up, eat my porridge,
do my stretches, meditate,

680
00:37:06,638 --> 00:37:08,115
and then I go to work,

681
00:37:08,139 --> 00:37:11,885
except my job
is to protect the fixed point.

682
00:37:11,909 --> 00:37:15,250
Job, porridge? Who are you?

683
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:18,409
The last time I saw you,
you were a despicable villain.

684
00:37:19,546 --> 00:37:21,757
After the Black Flash vaporized me,

685
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:24,459
the time wraiths pulled me
back from nothingness.

686
00:37:24,483 --> 00:37:29,388
They still had a plan for me.

687
00:37:30,823 --> 00:37:33,501
My powers stripped, I was "re-educated"

688
00:37:33,525 --> 00:37:37,039
and assigned here
to protect this fixed point.

689
00:37:37,063 --> 00:37:38,873
As penance for your past crimes.

690
00:37:38,897 --> 00:37:40,042
No.

691
00:37:40,066 --> 00:37:41,476
Believe it or not, Sara,

692
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:44,947
I came to see their point
that history cannot

693
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:48,205
and should not be changed.

694
00:37:49,508 --> 00:37:51,053
So I'm posted here

695
00:37:51,077 --> 00:37:55,212
making sure this fixed point
remains intact with this.

696
00:37:56,882 --> 00:37:59,928
This keeps me trapped in this day,

697
00:37:59,952 --> 00:38:02,030
June 28, 1914.

698
00:38:02,054 --> 00:38:05,066
When this timer hits zero,
it jumps me back 24 hours.

699
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:07,935
It can also freeze time,
as you've discovered.

700
00:38:07,959 --> 00:38:10,360
It really is just a handy little gadget.

701
00:38:11,129 --> 00:38:14,175
So tell me why you are so fixed

702
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:17,078
on unfixing this fixed point.

703
00:38:17,102 --> 00:38:20,169
Say that five times fast.

704
00:38:20,872 --> 00:38:23,584
Look, I don't want to stop World War I,

705
00:38:23,608 --> 00:38:25,752
not forever at least.

706
00:38:25,776 --> 00:38:27,420
I just need to stop it long enough

707
00:38:27,444 --> 00:38:29,555
to attract the attention of our timeship

708
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:31,657
so we can steal it back from the evil Ai

709
00:38:31,681 --> 00:38:34,682
that's controlling it and
her army of evil robots.

710
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,354
I'm just trying to get everyone home.

711
00:38:41,058 --> 00:38:45,205
You may be determined to
protect this point in history,

712
00:38:45,229 --> 00:38:47,907
but my drive to keep my family safe

713
00:38:47,931 --> 00:38:49,775
will break you down.

714
00:38:49,799 --> 00:38:53,246
So unless you have another idea

715
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:55,348
to get me out of your hair,

716
00:38:55,372 --> 00:38:58,507
I guess we should get back
to fighting forever.

717
00:39:00,411 --> 00:39:02,177
Well...

718
00:39:04,381 --> 00:39:06,814
There is one other idea.

719
00:39:08,185 --> 00:39:10,063
I might be able to buy you some time

720
00:39:10,087 --> 00:39:11,398
by making it look like

721
00:39:11,422 --> 00:39:13,522
the assassination was prevented.

722
00:39:14,358 --> 00:39:15,568
How?

723
00:39:15,592 --> 00:39:17,303
I'll make it so Gabriela Princip

724
00:39:17,327 --> 00:39:19,438
will still assassinate the archduke,

725
00:39:19,462 --> 00:39:20,706
only in 40 minutes,

726
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:22,941
but your ship's Ai won't know that.

727
00:39:22,965 --> 00:39:26,478
It'll just think that there's
been a five-alarm aberration.

728
00:39:26,502 --> 00:39:28,947
40 minutes is plenty of time
for us to get our ship back.

729
00:39:28,971 --> 00:39:31,416
Fair warning, though,
you go one second over,

730
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,819
and I will have no choice
but to try and kill you again,

731
00:39:34,843 --> 00:39:38,023
and if you kill me, you must swear

732
00:39:38,047 --> 00:39:42,252
to take up my post and
protect the fixed point.

733
00:39:47,856 --> 00:39:49,323
You have a deal.

734
00:40:01,971 --> 00:40:03,901
You got 40 minutes, Sara Lance.

735
00:40:26,629 --> 00:40:29,741
Yes! Yes!

736
00:40:29,765 --> 00:40:32,276
They actually did it.

737
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,678
Now what happens?

738
00:40:33,702 --> 00:40:37,270
Oh, time is being rewritten as we speak.

739
00:40:38,273 --> 00:40:41,486
- Get into your positions.
- Hey, you two, stay here.

740
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:43,855
Oh, yes, Dr. Haywood. Yes, of course.

741
00:40:43,879 --> 00:40:45,545
Oh! Oh, my lord.

742
00:40:47,415 --> 00:40:49,560
I've always wanted to do that.

743
00:40:49,584 --> 00:40:51,017
Me too.

744
00:40:52,187 --> 00:40:54,317
Wow. Okay, fantastic.

745
00:40:55,923 --> 00:40:59,392
We'll, uh, hold the fort, as it is.

746
00:41:05,334 --> 00:41:06,599
There she is.

747
00:41:09,971 --> 00:41:14,176
Get ready, Legends.
This time, there's no do-overs.

748
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,881
Greg, move your head.

749
00:41:38,905 --> 00:41:44,305
