1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:03,117
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:07,129
We could've had
a good thing, you and I.

3
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:11,418
- You!
- Yeah.

4
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:13,503
Me.

5
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:16,180
When I get out of here,
I'm gonna confess.

6
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:18,842
My connection with Sofia. All of it.

7
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:22,429
No, you wanna pay your debt,
you live with it.

8
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,100
It's what the city needs.

9
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:25,890
<i>When I brought you back to life,</i>

10
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:28,317
<i>I asked you to be
my eyes and ears in Gotham.</i>

11
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:30,770
<i>You became so much more.</i>

12
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,151
- Let her go, now.
- No!

13
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:35,358
- I'll never go with you.
- No!

14
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:38,820
<i>You killed her!</i>

15
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:41,323
So, now, you're gonna return it?

16
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,959
What am I supposed to say?
"I stole your jewelry. Sorry."

17
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,206
Sometimes, that's enough.

18
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:47,286
Can you do it?

19
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:49,288
<i>Migraine still?</i>

20
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:51,340
<i>It's like I've been hit
in the head with a brick.</i>

21
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:58,806
You could escape anytime.

22
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,133
You're planning something.

23
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:03,095
Something spectacular.

24
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:04,683
But, when we're done,

25
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:09,108
the world out there,
that'll be the asylum.

26
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:20,129
Get back in your bunk, Tetch.

27
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:27,687
Don't even try hypnotizing me.
I can't hear a word you're saying.

28
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:36,066
I'm not talking to you!

29
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,033
I'm talking to her.

30
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:45,698
Jeez. Tortuga.
You almost gave me a heart attack.

31
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:49,455
Wait. Where the hell
are your headphones?

32
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:58,584
Did I do it right?

33
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,887
Right as rain, in the plain in Spain.

34
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:17,771
Knock, knock, called the cock.
Time to rise and wield your scythe.

35
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:27,281
I fear I will require
a moment more, Mr. Tetch.

36
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:29,366
Our moment is fleeting,
my dear Mr. Crane.

37
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:31,667
Its wings desperately beating.

38
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:49,344
There, now, scarcely a drop spilled.

39
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:52,438
Shall we, Mr. Tetch?

40
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,891
Let us be at pains, Mr. Crane.

41
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,248
When I say "three hairs
past a freckle," gentlemen,

42
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:21,300
I do not mean five hairs past.

43
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,795
Let's do better next time, hmm?

44
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:26,347
Mind both P's and Q's, Valeska.

45
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:29,471
We are not your militia
to be becked and called.

46
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:33,938
I dread to think
where you'd be without us.

47
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:38,815
Boys, boys, let's not squabble
too early in our partnership.

48
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:42,196
There'll be plenty of time to stab
each other in the backs later.

49
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:47,573
But for now, stick to Jerome's plan,
and everyone will get what they want.

50
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:51,452
An earthly kingdom of terror.

51
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:54,705
A piece of Gotham pie both sky and high.

52
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:58,755
That's the spirit, boys. Think big.
And kinky.

53
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:04,423
And lose the weirdo.
She's giving me the heebie-jeebies.

54
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:08,969
Your work is done, my dear.
Your race all run.

55
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:10,975
Glad to be of help.

56
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:21,144
Much better. Now,

57
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:25,072
to free the rest of our cronies,
and blow this pop stand.

58
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:01,813
Onward, march!

59
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,711
Sure you're up for this, Captain Gordon?

60
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:25,879
I'll manage.

61
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,961
Picked a hell of a night
to come back on the job.

62
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,795
- How many got out?
- Eighty-seven.

63
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,677
The entire violent ward.

64
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,632
Yeah, we rounded up
most of the serious nutjobs,

65
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,810
the guys that think
they're walruses and whatnot.

66
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:39,765
Ephram Snow, child murderer,
Daedalus Boch, mutilator,

67
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:42,896
Erasmus Rayne, cult killer...
All at large.

68
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:45,444
The surviving guards think your
old buddy, Tetch, was behind it.

69
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:49,023
No. This big, this insane,

70
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,734
Jerome Valeska put this together,
and there'll be more to come.

71
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,450
Got a lot of nervous cops
out here tonight

72
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,247
who are thinking along the same lines.

73
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,118
And I know what you're thinking.

74
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:02,874
Why not tell them the truth?

75
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:07,463
About Sofia, and the Pyg,
get it all out in the open.

76
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,338
I've kept my mouth shut
like you told me to.

77
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:12,046
Good, and I'm telling you again.
Don't slip.

78
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:16,138
Go over there
and be big Jim Gordon, hero cop.

79
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:20,305
It's what they need,
even if it is a lie.

80
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:26,561
- Hey, Cap.
- Good to see you, sir.

81
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:29,147
- Welcome back, Captain.
- Hey, back at it.

82
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,072
- Hey, Cap.
- Good to see you, boss.

83
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,400
All right, listen up.

84
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,200
If I'd have known I'd be seeing
your ugly mugs tonight,

85
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,576
I'd have stayed in the hospital.

86
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:43,415
Jervis Tetch, Jonathan Crane,
Jerome Valeska.

87
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,212
Each of these madmen

88
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,164
has wreaked a different
kind of havoc on our city.

89
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:50,092
Now they're on the loose,
and presumably working together,

90
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:53,255
along with several dozen
other garden-variety psychopaths.

91
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:56,136
Know their MOs,
their associates, their home turf.

92
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:57,887
Gotham needs you tonight.

93
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:02,100
Have each other's backs,
and we'll get through this. Let's go.

94
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,431
Yes, sir.

95
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:10,738
- Captain Gordon.
- Jim, Jim, Jim.

96
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:12,527
Why so grim, Jim?

97
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:15,284
Tetch. What do you want?

98
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:16,945
<i>I'm not playing any of your games.</i>

99
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:19,200
No games this time. Just some maims,

100
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,407
and your own share of blames
if you don't do what I tell you.

101
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,167
<i>To wit, James.</i>

102
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,123
<i>Find your way
to Wood Street and James Way.</i>

103
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:28,585
Do it, or I'm gonna kill someone!

104
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,132
In case you had any doubts.

105
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,004
- It's a setup.
- It's also our chance to catch him.

106
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:36,054
If we can get Tetch,
he can lead us to Valeska.

107
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:38,053
- I'll put a squad together...
- No.

108
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,260
The force is spread too thin
looking for the escapees.

109
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:45,097
- Let's go.
- Sure?

110
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,313
You said we had to have
each other's backs tonight, right?

111
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:49,769
I'm following orders, Captain.

112
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:05,826
- I had a thought.
- I'll alert the press.

113
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,663
- What if we're hypnotized?
- What?

114
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,331
Stick with me here.

115
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,341
We both listened to Tetch on the phone.

116
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:14,794
What if he hypno-ed us
into coming down here alone?

117
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,345
That would be pretty stupid,
wouldn't it?

118
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:20,717
So, what, we're either idiots,
or we're hypnotized? Good choices.

119
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,012
You did a good job
with the troops back there.

120
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:28,516
Thanks. This is Whit Street. Lights out.

121
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:33,570
What the hell?

122
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:46,662
We gotta get them out of there.

123
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,128
No, don't shoot, they're hypnotized!

124
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:55,426
- They're hypnotized! Don't shoot!
- Back off!

125
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:58,842
All right, buddy. Come on, hey!

126
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:00,889
Lo and behold,

127
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:05,553
the bold Captain Jim Gordon,
and his rusty caboose in tow.

128
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,055
You have us, Tetch, let them go.

129
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:12,860
Do you recall when
I first came to this fair city, Jim?

130
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:14,854
A bawling mess,

131
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:18,031
wanting nothing more
than to address the safety

132
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,775
of my dear sister, Alice?

133
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:22,035
What's the choice this time, Tetch?

134
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,614
How do I save them?
Just tell me what you want.

135
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:28,660
What I want is my sister back!

136
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:32,246
But you kept me from saving her.

137
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,793
You gave me no choice!

138
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:43,220
So, no more choices for you, either.
No more saving.

139
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:47,803
No!

140
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,985
Soon, the bells will toll, Jim.

141
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,942
How many more will grow cold, Jim?

142
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,986
Like your soul, Jim!

143
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:04,161
How many would-be flyers
will be die-ers?

144
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:08,123
Splattered like my poor spitted Alice.

145
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:12,203
When the Gotham bells
toll their full roll!

146
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,053
You said you needed help,
but you didn't say

147
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:32,724
anything about walking straight
into the GCPD.

148
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,567
You wanna bail out now?

149
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:40,281
No, I just wanna make sure
there's no jewelry debt.

150
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,486
There's no debt.

151
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,696
I helped you to get the jewelry back
because I want to help.

152
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,994
Nobody does anything just to help.

153
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,412
Fine. Once this is over,

154
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:50,206
there will be nothing left
to settle between us. Can you do it?

155
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:56,955
Okay.

156
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,506
Okay, got it. Which file?

157
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,222
Jerome Valeska.
There'll be a red Arkham stamp on it.

158
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:06,719
Valeska? What do you want with that nut?

159
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,050
He broke out of Arkham tonight.

160
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,635
Yeah. What does it have to do with you?

161
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,516
Can you just get the file
before someone sees us?

162
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:19,941
<i>The largest
single breach of security</i>

163
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:22,489
<i>in the troubled history of Arkham Asylum</i>

164
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:26,410
<i>has led to a citywide curfew
as many of the worst criminals</i>

165
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:29,534
<i>who have ever plagued Gotham
flood the streets.</i>

166
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:32,332
<i>Twenty-seven deaths have been
attributed to the escapees...</i>

167
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,330
The city is going crazy pants.

168
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:36,996
Can we turn that thing off?

169
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,960
We could be out there making a killing

170
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:42,008
while the cops are rounding up
all these nutjobs.

171
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:45,634
I am gonna go nuts
if we don't turn that damn thing off!

172
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,511
<i>Please be aware
that these escapees</i>

173
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,967
<i>are extremely dangerous...</i>

174
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:53,513
Another migraine?

175
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:56,474
Nothing a little
self-medication won't fix.

176
00:12:56,734 --> 00:13:00,193
And your hand? Got a pill for that?

177
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,284
I'll fix it.

178
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:11,990
I've been reading ancient history,
mysticism, philosophy,

179
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,287
anything that might reference
Ra's al Ghul.

180
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:16,039
I'm sick of hearing
that charlatan's name.

181
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,124
He brought me back to life.

182
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:21,173
We've never even met. Why choose me...

183
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,587
For all you know, he lied to you.

184
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,881
Maybe he just told you, you were dead.

185
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,716
I mean, you can't even remember
what happened.

186
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,431
It hurts to remember.

187
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:36,813
What?

188
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:40,984
The attacks I'm having,

189
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:45,526
it's like memories are trying
to push their way into my brain,

190
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:49,906
but when I go to touch them,
it's just this searing pain.

191
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:56,245
- You have to let them in.
- It hurts too much.

192
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,582
Listen to you,
whining like a little baby.

193
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:00,662
What?

194
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:02,999
You have been hiding here for weeks,
reading these books.

195
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,583
And now,
you're telling me you might have

196
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:05,838
all the answers in your head,

197
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,794
but don't want to get them
because it hurts too much?

198
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,555
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

199
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,891
No, I have no idea who I'm talking to.

200
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,810
The Barbara I know wouldn't let
anything that she's afraid of

201
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:17,058
stand in the way of what she wants.

202
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:21,100
Not cops, not criminals, not blood,
and not pain.

203
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:39,288
I remember when it all went dark.

204
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:47,252
It was this blinding electric light,

205
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:48,335
and then,

206
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,296
nothing.

207
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:55,221
And then I remember...

208
00:14:58,940 --> 00:14:59,930
I remember...

209
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,648
I know. I hear you.

210
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:15,700
The world and its cruelties,
how unfair it's been to you.

211
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,830
I can hear you cursing it.

212
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:47,353
What a vital,
poisonous little mind you have.

213
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:51,566
And yet, everybody
hates you for it, don't they?

214
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:54,780
Yes.

215
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:58,580
Everybody hates me.

216
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:02,459
I don't know why.

217
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:06,755
I understand
that feeling very well, Barbara.

218
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:12,758
You are just the one
I've been looking for.

219
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:17,007
And I have a present for you.
But it's a secret.

220
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:22,058
You shall become The Demon's Head.

221
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:27,443
The League of Shadows
will be yours to command.

222
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:31,192
An army of assassins.

223
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:36,076
The world is weak, Barbara.

224
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,951
And you are strong.

225
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:44,077
Use the League to make the world

226
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:48,039
more like you.

227
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:50,923
Barbara?

228
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:59,968
I'm okay. Ra's just really...

229
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:03,888
Understood me.

230
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,642
So, you remember something?

231
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:10,569
Yeah. It's a beacon calling them here,

232
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,818
- and they're coming.
- Who?

233
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:18,068
The League of Shadows.

234
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:22,577
All right. Hey! Same story all around.

235
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:24,704
Last thing they remember is,
they were driving,

236
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:26,456
and then they were here,
and then it was cluck cluck,

237
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:29,038
here a chick, there a chick. Any luck?

238
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:32,086
Something bad's gonna happen.
And there's a time limit.

239
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:33,758
That's the Gotham bells' full roll.

240
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,756
Midnight, right?
That's less than an hour.

241
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,466
What's the bad thing
that's gonna happen?

242
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,389
I don't know.
He's gonna hypnotize more people?

243
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:42,343
- To do what?
- "Splatted like my spitted Alice."

244
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:45,144
His sister Alice jumped, was impaled.

245
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:50,021
"Flyers will become die-ers."
They'll be splatted.

246
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,980
- Oh, no.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on.

247
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,639
Bruce Wayne? What are you doing here?

248
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:23,516
Detective Harper.

249
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:26,804
Where is Captain Gordon?
I need to see him.

250
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:29,810
He's out on the Arkham break.
What do you need?

251
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:35,863
I need protection.
Last year, I captured Jerome Valeska.

252
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,486
He's clearly escaped so that
he can get his revenge on me.

253
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:41,493
Okay, I think
it's a little bit more than that.

254
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:43,571
I am very close friends
with Captain Gordon.

255
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:45,952
I'm sure
he wants me to be well-protected,

256
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:48,204
but if this is a matter of payment...

257
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:50,126
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Put that away.

258
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,503
What do you want, a bribery charge?

259
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,797
I... I just...

260
00:18:56,427 --> 00:19:00,512
- I'm sorry, I just...
- I'm just really scared.

261
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,510
I know Valeska wants me dead.

262
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:05,217
- I just know it.
- Take it easy, Wayne.

263
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:09,100
All right, you can stay here.
You'll be perfectly safe.

264
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:10,980
Okay.

265
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:18,481
All right, Wayne. Let's find you a seat.

266
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,952
Hold on, we're gonna get you down.

267
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:25,074
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

268
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,331
Tetch has them booby-trapped.
If we get too close, they'll jump.

269
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,080
But if we do nothing,
they jump at midnight.

270
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,416
How did he get to all of them?

271
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:36,714
And the drivers,
how did he hypnotize all of them?

272
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:38,417
What's that matter?
We gotta help these people.

273
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:40,047
We gotta put a net around the building.

274
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,717
A net won't work, Harvey.

275
00:19:56,779 --> 00:20:00,238
- Do you know this diner? Zach's?
- No, why?

276
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:01,944
Look, Valeska's uncle owns it.

277
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,113
He might know
where Jerome would go after escaping.

278
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,570
Still sounds like a cop's job to me.

279
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,459
I could've killed Jerome
after he kidnapped me, and I didn't.

280
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:16,170
Any harm he does now,
I share a part of it.

281
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:19,591
In a way,
I'm responsible for his life now.

282
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,170
I can't just wait to see
what the cops will do.

283
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:24,804
I have to get him back to Arkham.

284
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:29,634
What?

285
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:34,815
Your ego, Bruce. It's huge.

286
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:36,433
What?

287
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:41,317
Not everything is your fault,
or your responsibility.

288
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,610
Get over yourself.

289
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:46,193
It'll make you
a little easier to be around.

290
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,295
Thanks for the advice.

291
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:15,514
You sure you don't need my help anymore?

292
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:19,101
- We're even?
- You don't owe me anything, Selina.

293
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,478
You never did.

294
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:36,201
Are you sure you haven't heard
from your nephew, Mr. Trumble?

295
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,753
That monster killed my sister.
If I ever see him,

296
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,922
his screams are what you'll be hearing.

297
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:44,422
Just maybe give us a call
before things go that far.

298
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,350
Jeez, there's a lot of gum
under here!

299
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:54,769
Ah.

300
00:21:57,107 --> 00:22:00,100
You're lucky those flat-foots didn't
check under the table, Uncle Zach.

301
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:06,357
I mean, it's gotta be some kind of
health code violation or something.

302
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,411
Jim, it's happening
all over the city.

303
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,865
Thousands are climbing up on roofs,
more every minute.

304
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:17,625
Drivers, people at work,
on the streets, at home.

305
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:19,285
How's he getting to them?

306
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:25,000
Radio. He's broadcasting on radio.

307
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:26,505
He must have taken over a radio station.

308
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,632
Which one?
We don't have time to hit them all.

309
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,004
The drivers who grabbed us.

310
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:32,132
They were listening to the same station.

311
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:35,055
XTJN here.

312
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,803
WYED.

313
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,940
- WEPV.
- They were all on different stations.

314
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,693
He must have commanded them to change
the station, so we couldn't find him.

315
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,743
There's only one way
to know which one he's using.

316
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:56,039
What are you doing?
No, no, no, no, Harvey.

317
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,040
Harvey, hey! Harvey.

318
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:01,332
- Hey!
- WYED. Clear.

319
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:03,626
- Harvey, no, let me go...
- KPIL.

320
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:05,840
That toilet-paper jingle I love so much.

321
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:07,504
I kept Tetch out of my head
once before. I can do it again.

322
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:09,211
XDNJ!

323
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,550
- It's that song I hate.
- Come on!

324
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:14,632
Mmm.

325
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,510
Too cold.

326
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,597
Ah! Too hot. Ah!

327
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:24,856
Oh. Just right.

328
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:28,104
Mmm.

329
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:30,566
You always could cook up a storm, Unc.

330
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:33,281
I remember back in the circus,
we used to dare each other

331
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:36,909
to sneak into the chuck wagon
to steal one of your cookies or two.

332
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:40,158
That reminds me
of my favorite meal you ever cooked.

333
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:43,745
You remember that time

334
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:46,047
you caught me trying
to snag a snickerdoodle?

335
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:47,415
Oh.

336
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:51,302
That soup you made that day.
Mmm, <i>mamma mia.</i>

337
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:55,136
What was the special ingredient again?

338
00:23:56,268 --> 00:24:00,182
Ah, right. It was my hand.

339
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:05,608
The one you dipped
in a boiling pot of chicken stock!

340
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:09,404
That smell, it was...

341
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:16,195
Mouth-watering.

342
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:21,207
- Almost as good as this. Mmm.
- That's a good story, nephew.

343
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,080
But aren't you curious about the soup?

344
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:27,418
- Don't tell me it's poisoned.
- Not at all.

345
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:29,666
Mmm.

346
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,343
You had me worried there
for a second, Unc.

347
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:34,929
I set out three bowls of soup, nephew,

348
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:37,094
so I'd have enough for all my guests.

349
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:48,606
You remember Lunkhead from
his strongman days at the circus?

350
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:52,030
The minute I heard you broke out,
I knew you'd be headed here.

351
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:54,483
So, I invited good old Lunk
for some supper.

352
00:24:54,702 --> 00:24:58,195
The "just right" soup is for him,
the "cold" is for me.

353
00:24:58,706 --> 00:25:01,870
I always loved gazpacho!

354
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:04,584
The "too hot," that's for you, nephew.

355
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:17,464
I'm just saying, how could
there be a global army of assassins

356
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:18,594
we've never heard of?

357
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:21,347
What part of "League of Shadows"
do you not understand?

358
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,604
- And they're coming here?
- To me. They're coming to me.

359
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:27,516
Well, hell, Barb, shouldn't we be
getting ready for them or something?

360
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:31,523
Oh, I'm ready. As soon as
they wanna show themselves.

361
00:25:31,822 --> 00:25:32,812
What?

362
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:35,110
You can stop hiding.

363
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:38,951
I know you're there.

364
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:52,249
We're here for The Demon's Head.

365
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:54,042
Where is he?

366
00:25:57,556 --> 00:26:00,390
"She" is right here.

367
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:09,557
Harvey!

368
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:10,767
WZPZ.

369
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:12,443
<i>Time to climb
to the tippy-top of every tower.</i>

370
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:15,234
<i>- When the bell strikes 12:00...</i>
- Jim! WZPZ.

371
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:16,947
<i>- Pell-mell over the edge...</i>
- Stop listening.

372
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:18,400
That's an order, you hear me?

373
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:19,530
Stop listening.

374
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,703
- WZPZ.
- Change the station.

375
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:23,030
Come on, Harvey, change the station.

376
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:25,706
Oh, whoa.

377
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:28,659
Wait...

378
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:32,748
Sorry, pal,
there's something I gotta do.

379
00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:37,093
Hickory dickory dock
The cop who went up the clock

380
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:38,629
The clock struck 12:00

381
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,759
He fell pell-mell
And that was it for the cop.

382
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:51,900
<i>- Gotham Central.</i>
- Harper, it's Gordon.

383
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:54,565
Cap, it is crazy here.
I got seven cops ready to jump,

384
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:56,362
I got calls coming in from everywhere.

385
00:26:56,532 --> 00:26:59,445
It's Tetch, he's broadcasting
from the WZPZ station.

386
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:02,235
- Okay, I'll redirect units.
<i>- No, I want all cars on the street,</i>

387
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:05,037
ready to amplify
in the emergency G911 band.

388
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:07,161
Radio teams on
as many roads as possible.

389
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:08,241
And then what?

390
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:09,701
Wait for my signal.

391
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,427
Wait, wait, wait. No, no. No!

392
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:32,228
Here, nephew. Have a taste
of one of my three soups.

393
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:35,484
No, no, no, no.

394
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:38,530
My sister had the wrong idea
with you, keeping you around.

395
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:40,857
She should have put you
in a sack with some rocks

396
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:41,987
and dropped you in the river!

397
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:45,782
Put this creep out of our misery.

398
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,458
- What the hell are you doing?
- Get outta here, kid.

399
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:53,452
No.

400
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:57,715
Look, kid, I appreciate
a concerned citizen and all,

401
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:59,508
but this is Jerome Valeska,

402
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:01,468
the psycho
who broke out of Arkham tonight.

403
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,797
And what we're doing is giving him
what he deserves.

404
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:05,302
No one deserves that.

405
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:07,224
- You tell him...
- Shut up.

406
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:08,384
Stop.

407
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:10,770
Call the police,
and they'll come for him.

408
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,686
Aw, jeez, let him go.

409
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:17,985
And get rid of the kid.

410
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:30,953
Look what we left lying around.

411
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:33,580
Enough reliving old memories,
Uncle Zach.

412
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,669
Tell me what I wanna know.
You know why I'm here.

413
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:36,963
I don't know anything!

414
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:43,512
It's too bad we're out of soup.
I wonder what else is on the menu.

415
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:44,962
Ah!

416
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,309
She's got the mark of The Demon's Head.

417
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:54,974
- Ra's chose her.
- She doesn't even know what it is.

418
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:58,442
I know it means
I'm your new damn leader.

419
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:00,110
Is that all you think it is?

420
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,237
Ra's didn't explain everything.

421
00:29:02,616 --> 00:29:04,152
Look at the mess he's left us with.

422
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:06,200
You have the mark of The Demon's Head,

423
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:08,903
but no woman has ever been allowed
to lead the League of Shadows.

424
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,158
I'm sorry, you just said what?

425
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:14,209
Women serve in the League,
but they do not lead.

426
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:19,251
That's not a law, just
a stupid tradition. Ra's chose her.

427
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,671
We need to honor his choice.

428
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:24,002
That's true.

429
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:28,056
As long as you have The Demon's Head,
the League must follow you.

430
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:29,348
Now, we're back on track.

431
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:33,352
So, I guess I'll have to
cut The Demon's Head from you.

432
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,524
Anyone else want a shot at the title?

433
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:52,705
- Here comes the airplane.
- No, no, no.

434
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,078
No, no, I'll tell you! I'll tell you.

435
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:58,207
She picked St. Ignatius!
The school is St. Ignatius!

436
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:01,752
Got it. Lost it. Write it down.

437
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:14,556
Thanks. It's been
great catching up, Uncle Zach.

438
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,393
You really brought back
the utter helplessness of childhood.

439
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:22,231
Well, see you around.
I mean, except the opposite.

440
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:30,444
Boy billionaire Bruce Wayne, my savior.

441
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:33,325
Wow, I did not see that one coming.

442
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:40,670
Uh, you know, with Uncle Zach,
the beatings just never stopped.

443
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:45,758
They went on and on.
And nobody ever helped me.

444
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,132
Ever.

445
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:51,680
And that makes a man wonder,

446
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:55,059
what the hell is wrong with you?

447
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:01,566
The only thing funnier
than you saving my life,

448
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:03,435
would be if I saved yours.

449
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:04,810
No!

450
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:06,605
No. Wait.

451
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:09,691
What would be funnier

452
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:13,616
is if you were choked to death
by the guy that you saved me from.

453
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:18,165
Yeah, yeah, we'll do that instead.
Yeah, yeah, do your thing.

454
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:29,631
Almost magic hour, Gothamites.

455
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:32,471
Time to climb
to the tippy-top of every tower.

456
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:35,345
When the bell strikes 12:00,
throw yourselves,

457
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,978
pell-mell over the edge,
onto your heads!

458
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:42,849
Shut up, Tetch.

459
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:53,238
This is Captain Gordon of the GCPD.

460
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,695
<i>- Am I coming through?</i>
- You're coming through.

461
00:31:56,123 --> 00:31:57,455
<i>They can hear you all over the city.</i>

462
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,791
All right, Tetch,
you're gonna tell those people

463
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:03,369
to step back from the ledge. No tricks.

464
00:32:03,964 --> 00:32:07,207
You go off-script,
and I'll shoot pieces off you

465
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:09,087
till you do what I say.

466
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:13,554
I would love to do as you command, Jim.

467
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:17,266
But sadly, I've tied my own hands.

468
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:18,433
Your hands?

469
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:30,734
I can't stop them.

470
00:32:30,824 --> 00:32:35,535
If anyone tells them
to save themselves, they'll jump.

471
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:38,784
You're more than welcome to try, Jim.

472
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:42,037
Obey the next voice you hear!

473
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,459
Tell them anything,

474
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:47,046
it will not matter
when the bells start to ring.

475
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:50,842
Your oh-so-callous caused
the death of my darling Alice, Jim.

476
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:57,224
Try, and they die.
Stand by, and they all try to fly.

477
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:00,843
Cap?

478
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:06,023
<i>Cap, what do we do? How do we save them?</i>

479
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:13,030
I could watch this all night, Bruce!

480
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,291
Hands off, big boy.

481
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,335
Still don't need my help, Bruce?

482
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:36,462
Selina.

483
00:33:37,891 --> 00:33:42,010
"Selina," huh?
Well, isn't that a nice name.

484
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:46,981
- Selina.
- No, no, no.

485
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,767
She's not that kind of girl.

486
00:33:51,655 --> 00:33:54,489
- Wrong answer, freak.
- Oh. That's funny, 'cause...

487
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:06,413
Oh, all right, see you crazy kids later!

488
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:07,660
Ciao!

489
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:12,960
You should've let me shoot him.

490
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,629
Would've been over by now.

491
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:22,091
Selina, I told you
I'm responsible for him.

492
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:25,428
I can't just let him be shot, Selina,
I can't.

493
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:28,685
I'm not taking responsibility
for this mess.

494
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:32,318
So, let's get out of here
before the cops show up. Yeah?

495
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:35,813
Come on.

496
00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:40,576
It's not over yet.

497
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:47,161
Hey, suit yourself.

498
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:51,207
Just don't take

499
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:56,300
so much responsibility,
that you get yourself killed.

500
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:21,609
Some legacy
your dead boyfriend left you.

501
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:26,281
No. Ra's chose me for a reason.
I know it.

502
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:40,136
You're weak. You're all so damn weak.

503
00:35:41,598 --> 00:35:42,759
That's it.

504
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,638
That is why Ra's chose me.

505
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:51,143
Because he knew I would see
how pitiful you all are.

506
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:58,317
Afraid of change,
afraid to take orders from a woman.

507
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:03,158
Well, listen up! I am The Demon's Head!

508
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:07,830
So, you sons of bitches
better start bowing down right now,

509
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:10,541
or it's gonna get ugly up in here.

510
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:39,941
You're right. They were weak.

511
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,941
And the mission of the League
of Shadows is to cull weakness.

512
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:45,283
They were unfit and needed to die.

513
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,618
But the sisters of the League
are yours to command.

514
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,829
Well, it's not much
of a league now, is it?

515
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:56,495
We're the point of the spear, Barbara.

516
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,459
Hundreds will follow you.

517
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:02,130
What the hell?

518
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:04,257
You have no idea
what they expect from you.

519
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:07,966
This is mine, Tabitha.
And I'm taking it.

520
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:14,938
Tell me what I need to know.

521
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:28,493
<i>Cap, what do we do?</i>

522
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,831
I can't save you.

523
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:44,677
Save each other.

524
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:49,424
<i>Save each other. Save each other.</i>

525
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:03,354
<i>It worked.</i>

526
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:06,232
It worked. They're stepping away.

527
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:09,611
What?

528
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:11,036
I got you. I got you.

529
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:50,534
Heard we got nothing from Tetch
about Valeska's plans.

530
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,828
Not a word the whole time
the medics were patching him up.

531
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:56,414
Still, 40 escapees back in the can,

532
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:59,084
and a lot of people with their feet
safely on the ground.

533
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:03,289
- You need a drink.
- I don't keep it around.

534
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:06,546
Squirrels hide nuts for the winter.

535
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:10,971
I got this for whenever.

536
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:36,993
I don't belong here.
I don't deserve to be here.

537
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:39,207
Not in this office,
not in this building.

538
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:42,370
By rights, I should be in jail.

539
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,087
No argument from me.

540
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:48,088
But say you were in jail,
sucking on your own misery,

541
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:51,879
where would the thousands
of people you saved tonight be, huh?

542
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:53,509
Where would I be?

543
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:56,763
What you did tonight was heroic.

544
00:39:58,605 --> 00:40:01,143
You could've done what I did.
Anyone could have.

545
00:40:02,692 --> 00:40:04,558
You know what I was thinking
when I jumped in that car

546
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,393
and I was flicking
through those channels?

547
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:10,072
I was thinking,
"I can do this crazy thing

548
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:14,611
"'cause if it goes sideways,
Jim Gordon will save me."

549
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:17,280
And here we are.

550
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:19,407
Who I am,

551
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:27,002
what I've always said I believe in,
it's like it's a lie now, Harvey.

552
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:31,297
Feet of clay are heavy to carry around.

553
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:33,428
That's what the whiskey's for.

554
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:43,514
I judged you. For a long time.

555
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:46,812
I shouldn't have done that.

556
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:55,151
What you know about me, Jim,
is just the tip of the iceberg.

557
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,572
There are no heroes here.

558
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:05,419
No heroes here.

559
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:11,833
Yeah?

560
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:15,804
Got the Wayne kid on line three.
Something about Valeska.

561
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:23,308
<i>- Bruce, are you okay?</i>
- I saw Jerome Valeska tonight.

562
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:24,931
- He killed his uncle.
- What?

563
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:27,353
<i>He was looking for the name
of a school, St. Ignatius.</i>

564
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,067
- Why?
- I'm on my way to find out.

565
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:30,853
<i>No, wherever you are, stay put.</i>

566
00:41:30,947 --> 00:41:32,904
Valeska is my problem
as much as anyone's.

567
00:41:33,116 --> 00:41:34,698
<i>- I'm going after him.</i>
- Damn it, Bruce.

568
00:41:34,784 --> 00:41:36,491
Stay the hell away from that madman.

569
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:38,243
I'll see you at St. Ignatius, Jim.

570
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,533
- You can yell at me there.
<i>- Bruce...</i>

571
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,366
Kid in trouble again?

572
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:46,167
More than he can handle. Let's go.

573
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:20,323
How do you like the new threads? Hmm?

574
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:23,288
Oh, speechless, I know.

575
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:27,792
You look a fright, Mr. Tetch.

576
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:29,996
Somewhat lame, my dear Mr. Crane.

577
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:34,459
But I do confess pure joy
in besting Jimmy boy with our ploy.

578
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:37,507
Yeah, yeah, you did a great job
keeping Gordon occupied,

579
00:42:37,597 --> 00:42:40,055
meanwhile, Crane got his Fear gas,
I got my information.

580
00:42:40,141 --> 00:42:43,009
Everything is going
according to my plan.

581
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:45,970
But no time to palaver, gentlemen.

582
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:47,475
We have fish to fry.

583
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:50,349
And by "fish," I mean faces.

584
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:52,067
Or feet.

585
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:56,196
Ah! Something fun to fry.

586
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:58,398
Buckle up.

587
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:04,701
All aboard!

588
00:43:06,042 --> 00:43:07,499
Ooh, I'm coming!
