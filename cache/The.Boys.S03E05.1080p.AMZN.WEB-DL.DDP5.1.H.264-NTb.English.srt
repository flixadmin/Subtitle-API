What are you doing?

1112
00:55:49,138 --> 00:55:50,973
[Hughie] Annie, listen.

1113
00:55:51,057 --> 00:55:52,850
We wanted a weapon.

1114
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:54,643
Soldier Boy's our weapon.

1115
00:55:54,727 --> 00:55:57,897
He's how we kill Homelander.
And Neuman maybe.

1116
00:55:57,897 --> 00:55:59,774
If anyone's strong enough,
he is.

1117
00:55:59,774 --> 00:56:02,276
Y-You knew Butcher
was gonna do this?

1118
00:56:02,276 --> 00:56:05,946
M.M. never would've
gone for it, and you...

1119
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:08,199
- Look, you weren't supposed to be here.
- [exhales] Oh.

1120
00:56:08,199 --> 00:56:10,951
So...

1121
00:56:11,035 --> 00:56:12,745
no more secrets, huh?

1122
00:56:14,872 --> 00:56:16,957
Hughie...

1123
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:19,168
you're teaming up
with a murderer.

1124
00:56:19,168 --> 00:56:22,296
This is the only way that I can
save you from Homelander.

1125
00:56:24,924 --> 00:56:26,592
I'm doing this for you.

1126
00:56:26,592 --> 00:56:29,428
Whatever it takes, remember?

1127
00:56:31,138 --> 00:56:32,932
Come with us.

1128
00:56:34,934 --> 00:56:37,561
You and me against the world.

1129
00:56:37,645 --> 00:56:38,938
[Butcher] Hughie.

1130
00:56:50,074 --> 00:56:51,867
Please don't go.
