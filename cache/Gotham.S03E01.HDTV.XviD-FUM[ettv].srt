1
00:00:01,495 --> 00:00:03,808
- Previously on Gotham...
- I set a bomb.

2
00:00:03,834 --> 00:00:05,444
- Thousands of people could die.
- Yes.

3
00:00:05,482 --> 00:00:07,476
But paying that price will be better

4
00:00:07,502 --> 00:00:09,955
than releasing what's down there.

5
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,264
Are you ready to play?!

6
00:00:14,332 --> 00:00:15,934
Wayne Enterprises runs Indian Hill,

7
00:00:15,972 --> 00:00:19,206
but who runs Wayne Enterprises?

8
00:00:19,231 --> 00:00:20,565
There's a secret council in Gotham.

9
00:00:20,633 --> 00:00:22,046
It's them that wanted me dead.

10
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:24,167
We're so close to the ultimate truth.

11
00:00:26,972 --> 00:00:30,391
Strange, you did a very bad thing to me.

12
00:00:30,455 --> 00:00:32,677
And now, you're going to...

13
00:00:32,745 --> 00:00:35,079
Impossible.

14
00:00:35,147 --> 00:00:38,140
Nothing is impossible.

15
00:00:42,664 --> 00:00:43,865
Thank you.

16
00:00:43,891 --> 00:00:45,772
Bruce, I might not see you for a while.

17
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,027
- Where are you going?
- I have to find Lee.

18
00:01:52,693 --> 00:01:54,069
Hello?

19
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,374
We're closed.

20
00:02:03,437 --> 00:02:05,104
If you leave now,

21
00:02:05,172 --> 00:02:07,206
I won't call the cops.

22
00:02:36,245 --> 00:02:37,919
Hey.

23
00:02:39,892 --> 00:02:42,108
Any chance you want to come quietly?

24
00:03:05,038 --> 00:03:06,672
Ow.

25

26
00:03:44,644 --> 00:03:46,728
At 8:15 this evening,

27
00:03:46,792 --> 00:03:50,149
an individual robbed a pharmacy
and attacked its owner.

28
00:03:50,217 --> 00:03:52,518
While we don't have an I.D. as yet,

29
00:03:52,586 --> 00:03:56,155
we believe this individual is
another escapee from Indian Hill.

30
00:03:59,826 --> 00:04:01,994
Are these monsters dangerous?

31
00:04:02,062 --> 00:04:03,596
Captain Barnes! Captain Barnes!

32
00:04:03,663 --> 00:04:05,131
Valerie Vale, Gotham Gazette.

33
00:04:05,198 --> 00:04:07,266
Why can't we see the escapee?

34
00:04:07,334 --> 00:04:09,235
Because crews are still
picking up the pieces.

35
00:04:09,302 --> 00:04:10,536
This isn't the first time

36
00:04:10,604 --> 00:04:13,205
that a bounty hunter has
apprehended an escapee.

37
00:04:13,273 --> 00:04:14,440
Is the GCPD incapable

38
00:04:14,508 --> 00:04:16,375
of handling this threat themselves?

39
00:04:16,443 --> 00:04:19,145
Whoa, only a handful of these
escapees have been brought in

40
00:04:19,212 --> 00:04:20,713
by bounty hunters.

41
00:04:20,781 --> 00:04:23,015
The vast majority were
apprehended by GCPD.

42
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:25,284
Excuse me. Excuse me.

43
00:04:25,352 --> 00:04:27,586
I take issue with the word "threat."

44
00:04:27,654 --> 00:04:30,956
These escapees are themselves

45
00:04:31,024 --> 00:04:32,958
victims of Hugo Strange.

46
00:04:33,026 --> 00:04:35,294
Now, if any ordinary
hard-working citizen

47
00:04:35,362 --> 00:04:38,130
wants to help get these
poor souls off the street

48
00:04:38,198 --> 00:04:40,533
so that they may receive
proper treatment,

49
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,235
well, these citizens should be lauded

50
00:04:43,303 --> 00:04:44,470
and rewarded financially.

51
00:04:44,538 --> 00:04:46,705
Mr. James, before they
were taken to Indian Hill,

52
00:04:46,773 --> 00:04:49,008
these "poor souls" were all
criminally insane inmates

53
00:04:49,075 --> 00:04:51,811
at Arkham Asylum, were they not?

54
00:04:53,046 --> 00:04:54,380
Next question.

55
00:04:54,447 --> 00:04:57,249
Hear that? You should be lauded.

56
00:04:57,317 --> 00:04:58,684
I'll settle for the cash.

57
00:04:58,752 --> 00:05:00,286
How many escapees you brought in now?

58
00:05:00,353 --> 00:05:02,555
- Hmm? Six?
- Five grand a pop?

59
00:05:02,622 --> 00:05:03,989
That's not too bad.

60
00:05:04,057 --> 00:05:06,292
What happens when there aren't any more?

61
00:05:06,359 --> 00:05:08,427
I don't think Gotham's running
out of monsters anytime soon.

62
00:05:08,495 --> 00:05:11,230
I really can't get
you to come back, huh?

63
00:05:11,298 --> 00:05:13,165
Look, whatever happened
when you went to see Lee,

64
00:05:13,233 --> 00:05:15,568
and you know I don't like to pry...

65
00:05:15,635 --> 00:05:17,036
Sure you don't.

66
00:05:17,103 --> 00:05:18,404
That's because you
won't tell me anything.

67
00:05:18,471 --> 00:05:20,940
The whole point is man's
not supposed to be alone.

68
00:05:21,007 --> 00:05:23,509
- You have a family here.
- Can't do it, Harv.

69
00:05:23,577 --> 00:05:26,287
But you got no problem
chasing down Strange's freaks?

70
00:05:26,299 --> 00:05:27,475
Yeah, it pays the rent.

71
00:05:27,526 --> 00:05:30,249
You are a cop in everything but name.

72
00:05:30,317 --> 00:05:32,451
Yeah, except I don't
have to listen to Barnes.

73
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:35,221
I get to go home when I
want, get drunk when I want.

74
00:05:35,288 --> 00:05:37,623
And at the end of the day, I sleep.

75
00:05:37,691 --> 00:05:40,559
'Cause saving Gotham's
not my job anymore.

76
00:05:40,627 --> 00:05:42,127
Jim, I love you like a brother,

77
00:05:42,195 --> 00:05:44,463
but you've got to stop blaming the job

78
00:05:44,531 --> 00:05:46,832
for what happened between you and Lee.

79
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,767
And do you really

80
00:05:48,835 --> 00:05:50,936
think I don't get drunk when I want?

81
00:05:53,373 --> 00:05:54,573
Detective Bullock?

82
00:05:54,641 --> 00:05:56,108
I looked into the drug
the escapee was after.

83
00:05:56,176 --> 00:05:58,410
It's a powerful immune suppressant.

84
00:05:58,478 --> 00:05:59,578
Gordon.

85
00:05:59,646 --> 00:06:00,779
See, look at Lucius here.

86
00:06:00,847 --> 00:06:03,782
Our new resident expert
on all things scientific.

87
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:05,818
He said sayonara to
the Wayne Enterprises

88
00:06:05,886 --> 00:06:08,320
robots, hmm, and he loves it here.

89
00:06:09,789 --> 00:06:12,558
Wayne Enterprises revealed
itself as morally corrupt.

90
00:06:12,626 --> 00:06:15,694
Here, despite the primitive facilities,

91
00:06:15,762 --> 00:06:18,430
casual violence, fascistic
meathead culture...

92
00:06:18,498 --> 00:06:19,665
Lucius?

93
00:06:19,733 --> 00:06:21,133
I love it.

94
00:06:21,201 --> 00:06:22,434
Anyway,

95
00:06:22,502 --> 00:06:24,703
that drug is only sold at
three pharmacies in the city,

96
00:06:24,771 --> 00:06:27,273
and the other two pharmacies were
both robbed in the last month.

97
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,674
The question is

98
00:06:28,742 --> 00:06:31,176
why are Indian Hill escapees
now robbing pharmacies?

99
00:06:31,244 --> 00:06:32,478
Good question.

100
00:06:32,545 --> 00:06:34,813
So, what do you say just
like the old days you

101
00:06:34,881 --> 00:06:36,548
and me run it together... Huh, partner?

102
00:06:36,616 --> 00:06:38,651
You get a hard lead on an escapee

103
00:06:38,718 --> 00:06:41,487
and the price is right,
I'll bring him in.

104
00:06:41,554 --> 00:06:43,355
Thanks for the drink.

105
00:06:43,423 --> 00:06:45,758
Lucius.

106
00:06:45,825 --> 00:06:47,826
"Fascistic meathead culture"?

107
00:06:47,894 --> 00:06:50,496
I mean, you couldn't try to be
just a little bit more positive?

108
00:06:50,563 --> 00:06:52,748
- I was very positive.
- Uh-huh.

109
00:06:54,256 --> 00:06:55,990
Why is Hugo Strange the only
one that's been arrested?

110
00:06:56,057 --> 00:06:57,558
- The situation...
- And what about the rumors

111
00:06:57,626 --> 00:06:58,959
that Indian Hill is a
Wayne Enterprises facility?

112
00:06:59,027 --> 00:07:01,495
And how many more of these
escapees are at large?

113
00:07:01,563 --> 00:07:03,397
- Are we talking 20? 30?
- Excuse me, excuse me...

114
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:04,465
Just give me a blink if I'm close.

115
00:07:04,533 --> 00:07:07,535
The situation is firmly in hand.

116
00:07:07,602 --> 00:07:08,869
Liar!

117
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:12,940
Oh, no.

118
00:07:13,008 --> 00:07:16,277
My name is Oswald Cobblepot.

119
00:07:16,344 --> 00:07:18,679
We know who you are, Penguin.

120
00:07:18,747 --> 00:07:20,014
What do you want?

121
00:07:20,081 --> 00:07:22,516
What do I want?

122
00:07:22,584 --> 00:07:26,086
I want you to tell the truth
to the people of Gotham.

123
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:28,589
They would have us believe
that there is no danger.

124
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:31,158
But I was there the night

125
00:07:31,226 --> 00:07:33,260
those creatures broke
out of Indian Hill.

126
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:35,262
I saw them.

127
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,098
And I saw who's leading them.

128
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,633
Are saying the escapees are organized?

129
00:07:39,701 --> 00:07:42,336
Hello! That is what I am saying.

130
00:07:42,404 --> 00:07:45,072
There is absolutely
nothing to support that.

131
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,540
I told the police who to look for.

132
00:07:46,608 --> 00:07:49,043
I begged them time and again.

133
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:51,712
And they have done

134
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,514
nothing.

135
00:07:53,582 --> 00:07:56,350
And so I am here

136
00:07:56,418 --> 00:07:59,453
to speak directly to the good people

137
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:02,089
of Gotham.

138
00:08:02,157 --> 00:08:05,826
The enemy's name is Fish Mooney.

139
00:08:05,894 --> 00:08:08,429
"Fish Mooney"? She hasn't been spotted

140
00:08:08,496 --> 00:08:10,164
for over six months.

141
00:08:10,232 --> 00:08:13,133
She's either long gone or she's dead.

142
00:08:14,273 --> 00:08:16,737
I wish I shared your simple belief.

143
00:08:18,257 --> 00:08:19,773
She is a criminal.

144
00:08:19,841 --> 00:08:22,610
She is a murderer.

145
00:08:22,677 --> 00:08:24,278
And now God knows what kind of monster

146
00:08:24,346 --> 00:08:26,247
Hugo Strange has turned her into.

147
00:08:26,314 --> 00:08:29,683
I implore every citizen of Gotham,

148
00:08:29,751 --> 00:08:31,685
if you love your family,

149
00:08:31,753 --> 00:08:34,588
if you love your children,

150
00:08:34,656 --> 00:08:37,725
find Fish Mooney.

151
00:08:37,792 --> 00:08:41,395
Until then, no one is safe.

152
00:08:52,274 --> 00:08:54,341
Hello, Jim.

153
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:56,410
Oswald.

154
00:08:56,478 --> 00:08:58,913
I'm surprised you haven't found Mooney.

155
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,982
I hear you're quite the
bounty hunter these days.

156
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:07,288
You haven't made it worth my while.

157
00:09:07,355 --> 00:09:08,555
Oh.

158
00:09:08,623 --> 00:09:10,224
Tough guy now.

159
00:09:10,292 --> 00:09:12,626
But he makes a point.

160
00:09:43,258 --> 00:09:45,092
Ozzy.

161
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,727
Butch.

162
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:49,463
What a nice surprise.

163
00:09:49,531 --> 00:09:51,799
Forgive me for not coming sooner.

164
00:09:51,866 --> 00:09:54,201
The place looks marvelous!

165
00:09:55,337 --> 00:09:58,439
- Wouldn't you say so, Butch?
- Yeah, place looks great.

166
00:09:58,506 --> 00:09:59,940
I imagine you're here about your offer.

167
00:10:00,008 --> 00:10:02,609
To let us shelter under your umbrella?

168
00:10:02,677 --> 00:10:04,278
I only want what's best for you.

169
00:10:04,346 --> 00:10:05,579
I appreciate the thought.

170
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:08,182
But... we're big girls.

171
00:10:08,249 --> 00:10:09,350
We can handle ourselves.

172
00:10:10,251 --> 00:10:11,652
Can't we?

173
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,921
Sure we can.

174
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:15,656
Hey, Butch.

175
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,993
Hey, h-h-how you doing?

176
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,894
You taking care of yourself?

177
00:10:20,962 --> 00:10:22,696
Y-Yeah, yeah.

178
00:10:22,764 --> 00:10:25,299
So, uh, so how you doing?

179
00:10:25,367 --> 00:10:27,234
You already asked her that.

180
00:10:27,302 --> 00:10:28,602
Listen.

181
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,704
You guys should take
him up on his offer.

182
00:10:30,772 --> 00:10:32,706
Gotham's full of rough characters.

183
00:10:33,608 --> 00:10:35,409
You look great by the way.

184
00:10:36,878 --> 00:10:38,212
Wait over there.

185
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:39,313
Please.

186
00:10:41,282 --> 00:10:42,549
Poor bunny.

187
00:10:42,617 --> 00:10:44,763
Break-ups are hard.

188
00:10:45,587 --> 00:10:46,987
I offered to kill you.

189
00:10:47,055 --> 00:10:49,623
I thought it would raise his spirits.

190
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:52,693
It would be my pleasure seeing
as how you murdered my mother!

191
00:10:52,761 --> 00:10:54,428
But he is nursing

192
00:10:54,496 --> 00:10:57,498
some foolish hope that you
two will get back together.

193
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:00,567
Love.

194
00:11:00,635 --> 00:11:02,269
You can take your offer
and stick it up...

195
00:11:02,337 --> 00:11:03,737
We'll think about it, Ozzy.

196
00:11:05,607 --> 00:11:07,007
Fine.

197
00:11:07,075 --> 00:11:08,776
But that's not the only reason I'm here.

198
00:11:08,843 --> 00:11:10,544
Spread the word.

199
00:11:10,612 --> 00:11:12,780
I want Fish Mooney.

200
00:11:13,615 --> 00:11:14,915
And I will give a million dollars...

201
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,951
to whoever can bring her to me.

202
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:20,020
Dead...

203
00:11:20,088 --> 00:11:21,755
or alive.

204
00:11:21,823 --> 00:11:23,690
Chopped into pieces.

205
00:11:26,094 --> 00:11:27,828
I want her.

206
00:11:33,935 --> 00:11:35,335
You okay, Butch?

207
00:11:36,638 --> 00:11:37,971
World getting you down?

208
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:40,407
Yeah, I'm fine, kid.

209
00:11:40,475 --> 00:11:42,076
And you're too young to be in here.

210
00:11:42,143 --> 00:11:44,211
- Scram.
- Jeesh.

211
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:46,613
Just trying to be nice.

212
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:51,351
Just seeing her kills me, you know?

213
00:11:54,122 --> 00:11:55,456
Get over it.

214
00:11:55,523 --> 00:11:57,825
And that child just stole your wallet.

215
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,866
Hey, Barbara and that whip lady

216
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:08,168
are gonna get angry you
stealing from their customers.

217
00:12:08,236 --> 00:12:11,004
Let them. I got other things going.

218
00:12:11,072 --> 00:12:13,240
- Like what?
- Top secret.

219
00:12:13,308 --> 00:12:14,741
Let's eat; I'm starving.

220
00:12:14,809 --> 00:12:16,243
Hey, kid.

221
00:12:16,311 --> 00:12:19,246
Take it. It's yours.

222
00:12:19,314 --> 00:12:22,049
Keep feeding strays, one's
gonna follow you home.

223
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:23,951
Like you?

224
00:12:31,382 --> 00:12:34,583
Well, that should be the last of it.

225
00:12:34,651 --> 00:12:36,585
I'll put the kettle on.

226
00:12:36,653 --> 00:12:38,420
There's nothing like a sweet cup of tea

227
00:12:38,488 --> 00:12:41,156
to make home feel like home
after a long trip away.

228
00:12:41,224 --> 00:12:43,091
Hey, Master Bruce?

229
00:12:45,461 --> 00:12:47,296
You all right?

230
00:12:52,101 --> 00:12:54,503
Were we right to leave, Alfred?

231
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:56,171
Stay away all this time?

232
00:12:56,239 --> 00:12:58,273
Well, considering the
appalling sight of the topiary,

233
00:12:58,341 --> 00:13:00,008
I should say absolutely bloody not.

234
00:13:00,076 --> 00:13:02,044
Alfred, you know what I mean.

235
00:13:03,513 --> 00:13:05,781
I know you know why we left.

236
00:13:06,849 --> 00:13:09,051
We had to leave.

237
00:13:09,118 --> 00:13:11,153
You're nervous about
tomorrow, aren't you?

238
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,888
- Yes.
- Well, you wouldn't

239
00:13:12,956 --> 00:13:14,556
be human if you weren't.

240
00:13:14,624 --> 00:13:16,224
So, why don't you go
through there, take a pew.

241
00:13:16,292 --> 00:13:18,393
Pop your feet up,

242
00:13:18,461 --> 00:13:20,595
and I'll see about
that lovely cup of tea.

243
00:13:20,663 --> 00:13:22,097
All right?

244
00:13:40,516 --> 00:13:42,584
Saving that for someone special?

245
00:13:48,591 --> 00:13:50,258
Coffee, please.

246
00:13:52,495 --> 00:13:54,763
"Search continues for new
Arkham Asylum director."

247
00:13:54,831 --> 00:13:56,331
Right.

248
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,567
Good luck finding
anyone to take that job.

249
00:13:58,634 --> 00:14:00,369
I'm Valerie Vale.

250
00:14:00,436 --> 00:14:02,804
- Reporter for The Gazette.
- I know who you are.

251
00:14:02,872 --> 00:14:04,306
And you're James Gordon.

252
00:14:04,374 --> 00:14:06,208
Son of a respected Gotham D.A.

253
00:14:06,275 --> 00:14:08,577
Former war hero. Former
white knight cop.

254
00:14:08,644 --> 00:14:10,545
Now bounty hunter.

255
00:14:10,613 --> 00:14:12,080
You know, someone should
do a story on you.

256
00:14:12,148 --> 00:14:16,518
- Eh, not interested.
- Yeah, me neither, actually.

257
00:14:16,586 --> 00:14:18,120
You were there that
night, at Indian Hill.

258
00:14:18,187 --> 00:14:20,188
- I got nothing to say.
- What about the fact

259
00:14:20,256 --> 00:14:22,791
that besides Hugo Strange
and his assistant,

260
00:14:22,859 --> 00:14:24,359
no one else has been arrested?

261
00:14:24,427 --> 00:14:27,321
Or that despite everything
pointing to Wayne Enterprises,

262
00:14:27,359 --> 00:14:29,761
there seems to be zero investigation.

263
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:31,262
You're new to Gotham, aren't you?

264
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:32,363
Okay, this is where

265
00:14:32,431 --> 00:14:33,865
you tell me things
work differently here?

266
00:14:33,932 --> 00:14:35,800
I'm not from Gotham, but my dad's a cop.

267
00:14:35,868 --> 00:14:36,834
My brothers are cops.

268
00:14:36,902 --> 00:14:38,636
And things work the same everywhere.

269
00:14:38,704 --> 00:14:41,306
I was going to say it's
hard to find a quiet bar

270
00:14:41,373 --> 00:14:42,473
in the city.

271
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:43,775
I like coming here.

272
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:45,910
Please don't make me find another.

273
00:14:45,978 --> 00:14:48,446
Now, do you think Cobblepot's right?

274
00:14:48,514 --> 00:14:50,448
That Fish Mooney's
organizing the escapees?

275
00:14:50,516 --> 00:14:52,750
Penguin is a liar and a murderer.

276
00:14:52,818 --> 00:14:55,386
Hmm... but...

277
00:14:56,455 --> 00:14:58,289
But based on the escapees,

278
00:14:58,357 --> 00:14:59,657
and knowing Fish...

279
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:03,094
I hope not.

280
00:15:05,431 --> 00:15:07,298
Well...

281
00:15:07,366 --> 00:15:10,234
he's offering a million dollars
to whoever brings her in.

282
00:15:12,215 --> 00:15:13,570
You're welcome.

283
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:37,395
It's a puzzle.

284
00:15:38,464 --> 00:15:40,485
The trick is opening it.

285
00:15:40,754 --> 00:15:41,891
The man at the store said

286
00:15:41,929 --> 00:15:44,035
it's one of the most
difficult ever made.

287
00:15:44,103 --> 00:15:46,037
People pass it down unsolved

288
00:15:46,105 --> 00:15:47,338
for generations.

289
00:15:49,641 --> 00:15:51,909
A mathematician once went mad trying...

290
00:15:56,081 --> 00:15:57,415
Yes.

291
00:15:57,483 --> 00:15:58,683
Well,

292
00:15:58,751 --> 00:16:00,118
there you go.

293
00:16:00,185 --> 00:16:02,253
It was a lovely thought.

294
00:16:04,723 --> 00:16:05,823
And did you got the biscuits?

295
00:16:05,891 --> 00:16:07,658
A-And the sweater?

296
00:16:07,726 --> 00:16:08,893
I-I know how drafty these rooms are.

297
00:16:08,961 --> 00:16:10,561
- Mr. Penguin.
- Oswald.

298
00:16:10,629 --> 00:16:12,196
When I think of how I
treated you... Stop.

299
00:16:12,264 --> 00:16:15,366
Why are you being so kind?

300
00:16:15,434 --> 00:16:20,571
Talking to you these past months,

301
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,074
I don't know how I would've
gotten by otherwise.

302
00:16:25,043 --> 00:16:27,278
With Fish out there
planning who knows what...

303
00:16:29,615 --> 00:16:32,049
Me being surrounded by
morons and lunatics.

304
00:16:32,117 --> 00:16:33,751
I know the feeling.

305
00:16:37,089 --> 00:16:38,956
Why didn't she kill me
when she had the chance?

306
00:16:40,659 --> 00:16:42,029
I was powerless.

307
00:16:42,885 --> 00:16:45,096
She must have a larger goal.

308
00:16:45,164 --> 00:16:47,465
I-I need to know what she is doing.

309
00:16:47,533 --> 00:16:49,333
Do you?

310
00:16:56,842 --> 00:16:59,844
When Alexander encountered
the Gordian knot,

311
00:16:59,912 --> 00:17:02,947
a knot so complex no one had
ever been able to untangle it...

312
00:17:06,952 --> 00:17:10,822
he just removed his
sword and cut it in two.

313
00:17:10,889 --> 00:17:12,957
Details can be distracting.

314
00:17:13,025 --> 00:17:14,225
Sometimes...

315
00:17:16,128 --> 00:17:18,162
a simple solution is best.

316
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:21,299
See, no matter what she is planning,

317
00:17:21,366 --> 00:17:22,767
just remember...

318
00:17:26,972 --> 00:17:29,407
penguins...

319
00:17:29,475 --> 00:17:30,408
eat...

320
00:17:30,476 --> 00:17:32,677
fish.

321
00:18:11,483 --> 00:18:13,384
You know why we're here.

322
00:18:16,955 --> 00:18:19,490
- What are you doing here?
- Stop.

323
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:21,726
Stop...

324
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:34,005
So what are we after?

325
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:36,173
It's not like they keep cash around.

326
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:38,175
For now, survival. GUARD: Don't move!

327
00:18:39,545 --> 00:18:41,546
Hands.

328
00:18:43,015 --> 00:18:44,482
Hands.

329
00:18:47,753 --> 00:18:49,186
Of course.

330
00:18:55,594 --> 00:18:57,128
Drop the gun.

331
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:02,266
Now knock yourself out.

332
00:19:07,339 --> 00:19:09,707
That was awesome. How did you...

333
00:19:10,742 --> 00:19:13,544
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, Fish.

334
00:19:13,612 --> 00:19:15,179
I'm fine.

335
00:19:15,247 --> 00:19:16,914
Watch the door.

336
00:19:21,486 --> 00:19:23,487
Yeah, that's the only
company that makes the drug.

337
00:19:23,555 --> 00:19:25,590
Gray Pharma.

338
00:19:25,657 --> 00:19:26,958
They actually have a
warehouse here in Gotham.

339
00:19:27,025 --> 00:19:28,426
You think they could be a target?

340
00:19:28,493 --> 00:19:30,828
Well, they're the only
pharmacy that carries the drug.

341
00:19:30,896 --> 00:19:33,230
If somebody wants it, they'll
have to go to the source.

342
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:35,366
Let me find the address.

343
00:19:35,434 --> 00:19:37,268
That's all right.

344
00:19:59,391 --> 00:20:01,559
James Gordon.

345
00:20:01,627 --> 00:20:03,160
Hands where I can see them.

346
00:20:03,228 --> 00:20:06,130
So, what?

347
00:20:06,198 --> 00:20:09,066
You're here to collect the
bounty Penguin has over my head?

348
00:20:09,134 --> 00:20:11,902
What is it, a million dollars?

349
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:14,739
And to think I let that punk live.

350
00:20:14,806 --> 00:20:16,374
Well, then,

351
00:20:16,441 --> 00:20:19,910
I think you better cuff me.

352
00:20:19,978 --> 00:20:21,912
Cuff yourself.

353
00:20:23,482 --> 00:20:25,282
How many others you have with you?

354
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,884
They're all with me.

355
00:20:26,952 --> 00:20:28,919
Every wretched soul

356
00:20:28,987 --> 00:20:31,422
that Hugo Strange experimented on.

357
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:32,690
But tonight,

358
00:20:32,758 --> 00:20:34,158
just him.

359
00:21:22,271 --> 00:21:23,671
Did you hear them rats last night?

360
00:21:23,739 --> 00:21:26,074
Scurrying around in the attic,
driving me bloody bonkers.

361
00:21:26,141 --> 00:21:28,276
I'm gonna ask you,

362
00:21:28,343 --> 00:21:29,444
what's the point of having a caretaker,

363
00:21:29,511 --> 00:21:31,646
if they can't take care of nothing, aye?

364
00:21:33,744 --> 00:21:34,978
You all right, Master B?

365
00:21:35,046 --> 00:21:36,746
Hungry.

366
00:21:37,815 --> 00:21:39,416
- I should've eaten.
- Excuse me, gentlemen.

367
00:21:47,029 --> 00:21:49,023
I do this, there's no turning back.

368
00:21:50,722 --> 00:21:51,834
No.

369
00:21:53,664 --> 00:21:55,298
You say your piece.

370
00:21:57,097 --> 00:21:59,628
We'll see about getting you a
proper breakfast, all right?

371
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:16,600
I'd like to thank the board
for giving me this time.

372
00:22:17,668 --> 00:22:19,336
It will come as no surprise

373
00:22:19,403 --> 00:22:21,638
I'd like to talk about Indian Hill.

374
00:22:21,706 --> 00:22:24,207
I know preliminary
investigations have concluded

375
00:22:24,275 --> 00:22:26,443
Hugo Strange acted alone.

376
00:22:26,773 --> 00:22:29,379
I reject this conclusion.

377
00:22:30,454 --> 00:22:32,455
While trapped in Indian
Hill, I was led to believe

378
00:22:32,522 --> 00:22:35,424
an unnamed group had taken
control of my company,

379
00:22:35,492 --> 00:22:37,993
and it was they who hired Hugo Strange.

380
00:22:38,061 --> 00:22:39,495
I left Gotham

381
00:22:39,563 --> 00:22:41,130
both for my own safety and so that

382
00:22:41,198 --> 00:22:42,932
I might have the time to
discover hard evidence

383
00:22:42,999 --> 00:22:45,334
of their existence.

384
00:22:45,402 --> 00:22:49,338
A conspiracy theory?
That's why we're all here?

385
00:22:49,406 --> 00:22:50,973
Excuse me, Master Bruce.

386
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:54,076
Pardon me, sir, might I
have your name, please?

387
00:22:54,144 --> 00:22:57,747
- What?
- Your name... please, sir.

388
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:00,625
Crowley.

389
00:23:00,664 --> 00:23:04,286
Mr. Crowley, did your parents
ever teach you any manners?

390
00:23:04,354 --> 00:23:06,689
I don't have to listen to this.

391
00:23:06,757 --> 00:23:08,724
Oh, but you do, sir!

392
00:23:08,792 --> 00:23:12,061
That is precisely the
point that I am making.

393
00:23:13,323 --> 00:23:15,100
I know how it sounds.

394
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:20,102
But I now have proof they exist.

395
00:23:21,304 --> 00:23:23,566
And I can tell you that they're here.

396
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:27,643
In this room.

397
00:23:31,712 --> 00:23:33,616
I want to talk face to face.

398
00:23:33,683 --> 00:23:36,118
You have 24 hours to contact
me, or the information

399
00:23:36,186 --> 00:23:38,154
that I've gathered will
be sent to every newspaper

400
00:23:38,221 --> 00:23:39,555
and television station in Gotham.

401
00:23:41,324 --> 00:23:43,659
Thank you for your time.

402
00:23:48,598 --> 00:23:50,466
Pancakes?

403
00:23:50,534 --> 00:23:52,268
Pancakes.

404
00:23:58,275 --> 00:24:00,209
And how did the board react?

405
00:24:01,511 --> 00:24:03,679
Then he leaves us no choice.

406
00:24:09,886 --> 00:24:11,420
Bruce Wayne.

407
00:24:12,456 --> 00:24:14,457
Do it quietly.

408
00:24:42,486 --> 00:24:44,887
- You Barbara Kean?
- We're closed.

409
00:24:47,958 --> 00:24:49,592
What?

410
00:24:49,659 --> 00:24:52,394
You built this club on our territory.

411
00:24:52,462 --> 00:24:55,998
We let you, 'cause we heard
Penguin had your back.

412
00:24:56,066 --> 00:24:58,534
- And now we hear that ain't so.
- Oh.

413
00:24:59,569 --> 00:25:02,137
Bad for you; good for us.

414
00:25:03,874 --> 00:25:05,007
Get the hell out.

415
00:25:06,743 --> 00:25:08,577
This place is ours now.

416
00:25:08,645 --> 00:25:09,979
Do you understand?

417
00:25:10,046 --> 00:25:11,146
You can't just come...

418
00:25:12,148 --> 00:25:13,582
Don't hit me, okay? Please.

419
00:25:48,618 --> 00:25:50,119
Hey. Hey.

420
00:25:50,186 --> 00:25:52,488
You still paying for stuff
about the Indian Hill freaks?

421
00:25:52,556 --> 00:25:54,123
Depends.

422
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:55,658
If it's good.

423
00:25:55,725 --> 00:25:58,294
Is Fish Mooney good?

424
00:26:09,506 --> 00:26:11,840
- Guess I'm finding a new bar.
- I heard you ran into

425
00:26:11,908 --> 00:26:13,208
Fish Mooney yesterday.

426
00:26:13,276 --> 00:26:14,910
- So?
- So...

427
00:26:14,978 --> 00:26:16,645
are you still interested in finding her?

428
00:26:16,713 --> 00:26:19,114
Every cop in the city's
looking for her now.

429
00:26:19,182 --> 00:26:22,284
But I know where she's gonna be next.

430
00:26:22,352 --> 00:26:24,787
- Why are you telling me?
- You see,

431
00:26:24,854 --> 00:26:26,522
I need something from the cops.

432
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:29,124
They're not gonna tell me,
but Bullock still trusts you.

433
00:26:29,192 --> 00:26:31,260
And you want me to lie to him.

434
00:26:31,328 --> 00:26:33,629
A million dollars covers a lot of sins.

435
00:26:33,697 --> 00:26:36,198
And obviously, I get to come along.

436
00:26:36,266 --> 00:26:38,434
Aw. Don't tell me you have a conscience.

437
00:26:38,501 --> 00:26:39,635
Yeah, all right.

438
00:26:46,643 --> 00:26:48,978
Jimmy, hey. So...

439
00:26:49,045 --> 00:26:51,246
after your run-in with Fish,

440
00:26:51,314 --> 00:26:53,248
Barnes had us up all night,
rousting her old hideouts.

441
00:26:53,316 --> 00:26:55,217
- Yeah. Did you find anything?
- Nada.

442
00:26:55,285 --> 00:26:57,620
But I did get what you asked for.

443
00:26:57,687 --> 00:26:59,788
Want to tell me what this is about?

444
00:26:59,856 --> 00:27:01,724
It's a hunch. Probably nothing.

445
00:27:01,791 --> 00:27:03,492
Well, if you got a hot lead
you don't want to share

446
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,927
so you can collect Penguin's money,

447
00:27:04,995 --> 00:27:06,261
I got no problem with that.

448
00:27:06,329 --> 00:27:08,731
Just don't get yourself
killed or me fired, okay?

449
00:27:08,798 --> 00:27:10,766
I'll do my best. Hey,
get some rest, huh?

450
00:27:14,771 --> 00:27:16,772
Hey.

451
00:27:23,313 --> 00:27:25,414
When'd you get back?

452
00:27:25,482 --> 00:27:26,949
A couple days ago.

453
00:27:28,618 --> 00:27:30,219
I tried to find you before I left.

454
00:27:30,286 --> 00:27:31,687
No worries.

455
00:27:31,755 --> 00:27:35,457
You remember what I discovered
that night at Indian Hill?

456
00:27:35,525 --> 00:27:37,559
That there was a secret group
that infiltrated my company.

457
00:27:37,627 --> 00:27:39,795
I wasn't paying attention.

458
00:27:39,863 --> 00:27:42,297
I needed time to research
them. I couldn't do it here.

459
00:27:42,365 --> 00:27:43,832
Okay.

460
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,300
I have a plan, but these
people are powerful.

461
00:27:45,368 --> 00:27:47,703
We need to assume they
know you and I are friends.

462
00:27:47,771 --> 00:27:48,871
You need to be careful.

463
00:27:48,938 --> 00:27:49,938
- Got it.
- I'm serious.

464
00:27:50,006 --> 00:27:51,940
I can see that!

465
00:27:55,278 --> 00:27:57,946
I'm sorry I was gone for so long.

466
00:27:58,014 --> 00:27:59,648
Don't apologize.

467
00:27:59,716 --> 00:28:01,617
Shoot, if I could fly to Italy

468
00:28:01,685 --> 00:28:03,919
and eat pizza all day, I would, too.

469
00:28:03,987 --> 00:28:06,155
- Switzerland.
- Italy's better.

470
00:28:06,222 --> 00:28:08,924
- Selina...
- Bruce, seriously...

471
00:28:08,992 --> 00:28:10,793
don't sweat it.

472
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,961
I got to go.

473
00:28:13,029 --> 00:28:15,931
I'll see you around.

474
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,835
Good to see you, Selina.

475
00:28:34,863 --> 00:28:36,964
- Hey, did you get it?
- Yeah.

476
00:28:37,031 --> 00:28:39,409
She's under guard in a
building on Douglas and 80th.

477
00:28:39,473 --> 00:28:41,140
There's one thing, though.

478
00:28:41,808 --> 00:28:43,342
Hey. Hey!

479
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:44,844
What the hell are you doing?!

480
00:28:44,911 --> 00:28:46,178
You're 100 yards from a police station.

481
00:28:46,246 --> 00:28:47,913
I'll be back in an hour or two.

482
00:28:47,981 --> 00:28:49,181
We had a deal.

483
00:28:49,249 --> 00:28:51,183
If there's a story, I'll
make sure you get it.

484
00:28:51,251 --> 00:28:52,752
Oh, you're a son of a bitch.

485
00:28:52,819 --> 00:28:54,153
Also, you could scream,
but then you'd have

486
00:28:54,221 --> 00:28:55,221
to tell the cops everything.

487
00:28:55,288 --> 00:28:57,456
And you'd lose the story entirely.

488
00:28:57,524 --> 00:28:58,524
Gordon.

489
00:28:58,592 --> 00:29:00,259
Gordon!

490
00:29:00,327 --> 00:29:02,995
Son of a bitch!

491
00:29:15,375 --> 00:29:17,777
47... this is dispatch.

492
00:29:17,844 --> 00:29:18,978
This is 47.

493
00:29:19,046 --> 00:29:20,279
Report to Captain Barnes immediately.

494
00:29:20,347 --> 00:29:22,648
Relief team will take
your place. Over and out.

495
00:29:22,716 --> 00:29:25,985
You got it. We're out of here.

496
00:29:55,749 --> 00:29:57,283
I knocked.

497
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:59,118
I didn't answer.

498
00:29:59,186 --> 00:30:00,920
You alone?

499
00:30:00,987 --> 00:30:02,688
All day, every day.

500
00:30:02,756 --> 00:30:06,292
I wasn't expecting
Jim Gordon to stop by.

501
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:09,595
You aren't supposed to be here, are you?

502
00:30:09,663 --> 00:30:11,897
How come you're not in jail?

503
00:30:11,965 --> 00:30:15,351
I agreed to testify
against Professor Strange.

504
00:30:15,936 --> 00:30:17,236
In case you're about to ask,

505
00:30:17,304 --> 00:30:19,939
I don't know who really ran Indian Hill.

506
00:30:20,006 --> 00:30:22,875
I don't care who ran Indian Hill.

507
00:30:22,943 --> 00:30:24,910
Then why are you here?

508
00:30:27,314 --> 00:30:28,781
Fish Mooney.

509
00:30:28,849 --> 00:30:32,485
And why would I know
how to find Fish Mooney?

510
00:30:32,552 --> 00:30:34,153
No reason you would.

511
00:30:34,221 --> 00:30:36,355
But it's clear whatever
you and Strange did to her

512
00:30:36,423 --> 00:30:37,756
is making her sick.

513
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:40,759
Her people are stealing drugs.

514
00:30:40,827 --> 00:30:41,994
But I don't think they're working.

515
00:30:42,062 --> 00:30:43,696
She's gonna come after you.

516
00:30:43,763 --> 00:30:45,898
Or her goons will.

517
00:30:45,966 --> 00:30:48,000
And they'll lead me to her.

518
00:30:48,068 --> 00:30:49,268
And how will they find me?

519
00:30:49,336 --> 00:30:51,370
Only the police are supposed to know.

520
00:30:51,438 --> 00:30:54,573
My guess... she'll have someone
get the information for her.

521
00:30:54,641 --> 00:30:57,376
Someone who wouldn't suspect being used.

522
00:30:57,444 --> 00:31:00,012
Maybe a reporter.

523
00:31:04,451 --> 00:31:06,986
She'll follow that person or whoever

524
00:31:07,053 --> 00:31:08,888
she goes to for help.

525
00:31:08,955 --> 00:31:10,756
In this case, a bounty hunter.

526
00:31:10,824 --> 00:31:12,057
Right...

527
00:31:12,125 --> 00:31:13,826
to you.

528
00:31:16,763 --> 00:31:18,264
You led them to me on purpose.

529
00:31:18,331 --> 00:31:20,733
You're using me as bait.

530
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,668
I don't like being played.

531
00:31:22,736 --> 00:31:24,637
Plus she's worth a million dollars.

532
00:31:48,028 --> 00:31:50,362
No! Gordon! Help!

533
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:52,131
Somebody help!

534
00:32:41,804 --> 00:32:43,338
I don't know, which one of you

535
00:32:43,405 --> 00:32:45,573
I want to bat over the
head with this cane more.

536
00:32:45,641 --> 00:32:48,142
I get it.

537
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:50,378
Life disappointed you.

538
00:32:50,446 --> 00:32:52,981
So what? Does that make you special?

539
00:32:53,048 --> 00:32:54,616
I'm done with you.

540
00:32:54,683 --> 00:32:57,406
You cross me again, I will
have you skinned alive

541
00:32:57,457 --> 00:32:59,420
and your head put on a pike.

542
00:32:59,488 --> 00:33:01,823
And you,

543
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:03,763
when I came back,

544
00:33:03,853 --> 00:33:07,195
and saw the way you handled
things while I was away,

545
00:33:07,262 --> 00:33:09,489
I swear, I had this feeling right here.

546
00:33:10,435 --> 00:33:12,000
I thought I was having a heart attack.

547
00:33:12,067 --> 00:33:14,335
But it was pride, Bullock.

548
00:33:14,403 --> 00:33:15,803
In you.

549
00:33:15,871 --> 00:33:17,864
The next time I have that feeling,

550
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:21,042
I'll know it was just gas.

551
00:33:22,544 --> 00:33:25,380
You both better pray that we find her.

552
00:33:26,697 --> 00:33:27,937
Get out of my sight.

553
00:33:36,425 --> 00:33:38,393
I'd say that went well.

554
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:41,025
He was right though.
About me being Captain.

555
00:33:41,383 --> 00:33:43,251
I did a good job. I even liked it.

556
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:45,920
Yeah. Hey, look, I'm sorry, Harvey.

557
00:33:45,988 --> 00:33:47,822
I'll do my best to find Peabody.

558
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:49,657
Honestly, Jim,

559
00:33:49,725 --> 00:33:51,593
for the time being, I think

560
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,995
it might be better if you just...

561
00:33:54,063 --> 00:33:55,296
stayed away.

562
00:33:56,332 --> 00:33:58,333
Hey. Hey!

563
00:34:00,803 --> 00:34:04,105
- Ow.
- Just tell me, did you know?

564
00:34:04,173 --> 00:34:05,673
Did I know what?

565
00:34:05,741 --> 00:34:07,041
That Mooney was using
us to find Peabody.

566
00:34:07,109 --> 00:34:08,776
You mean using you?

567
00:34:08,844 --> 00:34:10,445
Yeah, it's her kind of play.

568
00:34:10,512 --> 00:34:11,980
You should've told me.

569
00:34:12,047 --> 00:34:14,573
Sure. Why don't you tell
me who your source was?

570
00:34:15,584 --> 00:34:16,618
That's it?

571
00:34:16,685 --> 00:34:18,712
You're not gonna try and find Mooney?

572
00:34:19,922 --> 00:34:21,589
Barnes is on it. I've had a long day.

573
00:34:21,657 --> 00:34:22,957
I'm gonna get a drink.

574
00:34:23,025 --> 00:34:25,026
Gordon...

575
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:30,732
Nothing.

576
00:34:36,505 --> 00:34:39,140
- Come on.
- I said no.

577
00:34:39,208 --> 00:34:41,509
- Who are they?
- Just people.

578
00:34:41,577 --> 00:34:43,111
They need me to do things for them.

579
00:34:43,178 --> 00:34:44,379
Well, I can do stuff.

580
00:34:46,148 --> 00:34:47,882
These are scary people, okay?

581
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:50,991
- It's for your own good.
- You just don't want to share.

582
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:54,255
Just stay here, all right?

583
00:35:01,063 --> 00:35:02,664
Hello?

584
00:35:02,731 --> 00:35:04,599
What do you want?

585
00:35:04,667 --> 00:35:07,168
I want to talk to her.

586
00:35:07,236 --> 00:35:10,238
I was following her.

587
00:35:10,306 --> 00:35:11,934
She was kind to me.

588
00:35:13,742 --> 00:35:15,576
But then she met him. That boy.

589
00:35:15,644 --> 00:35:17,345
What happened to you?

590
00:35:18,511 --> 00:35:21,476
- You know me?
- Uh, yeah. I know Bruce Wayne.

591
00:35:21,514 --> 00:35:23,151
Who is he? Who is he?

592
00:35:23,218 --> 00:35:24,452
What's wrong with you? Let go of me!

593
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,553
Bruce Wayne!

594
00:35:25,621 --> 00:35:27,488
Bruce Wayne.

595
00:35:27,556 --> 00:35:29,424
Who is he?

596
00:35:32,094 --> 00:35:33,995
Really do not have time for this!

597
00:35:34,063 --> 00:35:35,196
He started it.

598
00:35:35,264 --> 00:35:36,431
It's a lie!

599
00:35:36,498 --> 00:35:37,899
They cwub is in our territory

600
00:35:37,966 --> 00:35:39,867
"Cwub?" What's a "cwub?"

601
00:35:39,935 --> 00:35:41,602
Cwub.

602
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:44,005
What's a "cwub?" I mean,
can anyone understand him?

603
00:35:44,073 --> 00:35:45,807
- Do you know what a "cwub" is?
- Cwub.

604
00:35:45,874 --> 00:35:47,742
Enough.

605
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:49,577
We will work something out.

606
00:35:49,645 --> 00:35:52,246
Now, this is his territory.

607
00:35:52,314 --> 00:35:54,048
What are you willing to give him?

608
00:36:03,859 --> 00:36:05,226
Boop.

609
00:36:06,295 --> 00:36:07,829
That is not helpful.

610
00:36:07,896 --> 00:36:10,598
Are you telling me you don't
see what's going on here?

611
00:36:10,666 --> 00:36:13,183
He is behind this.

612
00:36:13,861 --> 00:36:14,936
What are you talking about?

613
00:36:15,003 --> 00:36:17,438
He sent this ding dong to squeeze us,

614
00:36:17,506 --> 00:36:18,806
hoping it would send us back to you,

615
00:36:18,874 --> 00:36:21,309
so that he could lord it over Tabby.

616
00:36:21,377 --> 00:36:22,543
Ain't that right?

617
00:36:22,611 --> 00:36:25,246
That's c... that's just... that's crazy.

618
00:36:25,314 --> 00:36:26,881
She's crazy.

619
00:36:26,949 --> 00:36:28,649
She was in Arkham. Hello?

620
00:36:28,717 --> 00:36:30,251
"Hello?" So was I.

621
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,687
Is that true, Butch?

622
00:36:36,725 --> 00:36:37,992
Unbelievable.

623
00:36:47,803 --> 00:36:49,937
Fine. Run your club.

624
00:36:50,005 --> 00:36:52,006
Just so we're clear,

625
00:36:52,074 --> 00:36:54,008
the only reason you are alive

626
00:36:54,076 --> 00:36:55,476
is Butch.

627
00:36:55,544 --> 00:36:59,377
The moment he gives
the word, you're mine.

628
00:37:16,665 --> 00:37:18,433
Hello again.

629
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:21,135
I know why you brought me here.

630
00:37:21,203 --> 00:37:22,737
Your body is beginning to reject

631
00:37:22,805 --> 00:37:25,473
the changes we made to your DNA.

632
00:37:25,541 --> 00:37:29,143
You feel it every time you use...

633
00:37:29,211 --> 00:37:30,411
your ability.

634
00:37:30,479 --> 00:37:32,914
How do I fix it?

635
00:37:32,981 --> 00:37:35,016
Stop using the power.

636
00:37:35,083 --> 00:37:36,951
Every time you use it,

637
00:37:37,019 --> 00:37:39,086
new cells are activated,
and your body rejects them.

638
00:37:39,154 --> 00:37:43,057
Stop, and you will recover.

639
00:37:43,125 --> 00:37:44,703
It's that simple.

640
00:37:45,252 --> 00:37:46,676
It's just...

641
00:37:46,957 --> 00:37:49,797
I like the new me.

642
00:37:49,865 --> 00:37:51,999
I can't fix you.

643
00:37:52,067 --> 00:37:53,968
I can't re-order your DNA...

644
00:37:57,263 --> 00:38:00,333
There's... always a way.

645
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:03,611
Strange. He can.

646
00:38:04,913 --> 00:38:06,147
He's the only one.

647
00:38:10,089 --> 00:38:12,887
- Where is Strange?
- I don't know.

648
00:38:12,955 --> 00:38:15,323
They've hidden him somewhere secret.

649
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:18,526
Him fixing me is just the beginning.

650
00:38:19,761 --> 00:38:21,162
I want an army.

651
00:38:22,446 --> 00:38:24,532
I want an army like me!

652
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,034
And he is going to give it to me.

653
00:38:27,102 --> 00:38:30,549
- He can't.
- Oh, he will.

654
00:38:32,007 --> 00:38:33,774
Or he will die.

655
00:38:35,878 --> 00:38:37,778
You remember Marv.

656
00:38:37,846 --> 00:38:39,661
He's one of yours.

657
00:38:40,275 --> 00:38:42,984
Sort of a... fountain of youth

658
00:38:43,051 --> 00:38:44,952
in reverse.

659
00:38:51,326 --> 00:38:53,294
Good night, Ethel.

660
00:38:53,362 --> 00:38:55,396
No!

661
00:39:19,363 --> 00:39:20,909
We caught a spy.

662
00:39:21,379 --> 00:39:22,379
Ivy?

663
00:39:22,417 --> 00:39:24,585
Selina, tell this creep

664
00:39:24,652 --> 00:39:25,819
to let go of me.

665
00:39:25,887 --> 00:39:27,020
She's my friend.

666
00:39:27,956 --> 00:39:30,724
- I don't like spies.
- She's not a spy.

667
00:39:30,792 --> 00:39:33,193
Ivy, what are you doing here?

668
00:39:33,261 --> 00:39:35,229
I followed you the other day,
so I knew where you went.

669
00:39:35,296 --> 00:39:36,864
Bruce Wayne came looking for you,

670
00:39:36,931 --> 00:39:38,332
but he was acting all weird...

671
00:39:38,399 --> 00:39:40,634
Who else have you told about us?

672
00:39:40,702 --> 00:39:42,102
- No one.
- I asked her.

673
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:43,904
- Selina...
- Ivy, shut up!

674
00:39:43,972 --> 00:39:45,739
They're those monsters everyone's
talking about, aren't they?

675
00:39:45,807 --> 00:39:47,374
You better tell your friend

676
00:39:47,442 --> 00:39:49,109
to be careful who she calls a monster.

677
00:39:49,177 --> 00:39:50,844
You better stay away from me.

678
00:39:50,912 --> 00:39:52,146
All of you! I'll tell!

679
00:39:56,885 --> 00:39:58,273
Marv?

680
00:40:00,822 --> 00:40:02,623
No!

681
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:03,991
Leave her alone!

682
00:40:04,058 --> 00:40:05,993
Stay away from me!

683
00:40:09,664 --> 00:40:10,898
Ivy!

684
00:40:10,965 --> 00:40:12,299
Ivy!

685
00:40:17,172 --> 00:40:18,472
Ivy!

686
00:40:19,641 --> 00:40:21,108
Watch out!

687
00:40:22,844 --> 00:40:24,711
Help!

688
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:29,983
Ivy?

689
00:41:31,946 --> 00:41:33,780
Right, once this alarm
is set, Master Bruce,

690
00:41:33,848 --> 00:41:36,550
no coming downstairs till
the morning, is that clear?

691
00:41:36,618 --> 00:41:38,585
Yes, but was a new alarm
system really necessary?

692
00:41:38,653 --> 00:41:40,087
I don't know. Was it really necessary

693
00:41:40,154 --> 00:41:43,323
offering a challenge to a shadowy cabal?

694
00:41:44,726 --> 00:41:47,961
Yes, it was necessary, Master Bruce.

695
00:42:58,132 --> 00:43:00,233
Alfred?

696
00:43:00,301 --> 00:43:02,169
Alf...

697
00:43:02,236 --> 00:43:03,236
Alfred!

698
00:43:06,341 --> 00:43:07,908
Alfred, wake up.

699
00:43:07,975 --> 00:43:09,643
Alfred!

700
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:26,216
