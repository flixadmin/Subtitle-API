-GOT IT.
-WHERE?

THIS IS A LITTLE AWKWARD,

185

THAT IF WE GOT OUR LOCATION

186

SHARE IT WITH HIM.

UP HIS MASTER PLAN?

OF PROFILE,

289

TO GET HER KICKED OUT,

290
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,918

ABOUT HAVING HER
IN THERE.

291
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,295
ANY ADVICE?

292
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:54,172

00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:02,721
TO FINALLY MEET YOU.

297
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:04,641
REALLY? HAVE YOU
WATCHED ANY
OF MY PIECES?

298
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:06,393
I HAVE, AND I THINK
YOU'RE OFF THE MARK

299
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,395
IN CERTAIN
INSTANCES.

300
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:09,937
IS THAT
ON THE RECORD?

301
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,398
IF YOU WANT TO
GET AN ACTUAL QUOTE,
MS. WILLIAMS,

302
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,608
YOU CAN GO THROUGH
ALL THE PROPER
CHANNELS.

303
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:14,817
THIS MEETING IS
STRICTLY ABOUT

304
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,236
THE REZONING
ORDINANCE.

305
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,904
YES. COUNCILMAN,
AS YOU KNOW,

306
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:19,656
I RAN ON A PLATFORM
OF UNITY,

307
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:21,824
BUT IT IS DIFFICULT
FOR A CITY TO BE UNITED

308
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,326
WHEN SO MUCH
OF THE ZONING WITHIN IT

309
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:25,078
REMAINS EXCLUSIONARY.

310
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,496
WE NEED TO OPEN IT UP,

311
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:28,164
ALLOW FOR MORE
AFFORDABLE HOUSING,

312
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:31,959
GIVE THE PEOPLE A CHANCE
TO START OVER AND REBUILD,

313
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,587
BUT THE SECOND
THE MONEY STARTS
ROLLING IN,

314
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:36,256
THOSE FAMILIES
GET SQUEEZED OUT

AS MUCH SORROW

470
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:48,753
AS DROPS OF WINE
ABOUT TO BE LEFT IN GLASS.

471
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:51,213
-PROCHNOST.
-PROCHNOST.

472
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,636
I GET US MORE DRINKS,
SOMETHING STRONGER.

473
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:57,678
ALL RIGHT.

474
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:01,975
IT'S A PARTY, VIKTOR.

475
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:03,101
LET ME GET YOU
A DRINK.

476
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,939
YOU MAY HAVE PASSED
ALL THE TESTS

477
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:10,024
AND SAID ALL
THE RIGHT THINGS,

478
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:12,192
BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE
FOR A SECOND

479
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,903
YOU ARE BRATVA.

480
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:15,195
THEN YOU WEREN'T
PAYING ATTENTION

481
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,115
DURING THE CEREMONY,
I GUESS.

482
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,407
LOOK AROUND YOU.

483
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:20,409
THESE MEN ARE HERE
BECAUSE GOVERNMENT MEN

484
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:23,079
LIKE KOVAR HAVE
TAKEN EVERYTHING
FROM THEM.

485
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:26,874
THE BRATVA IS MEANS
TO BRING JUSTICE

486
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,127
FOR ALL THOSE CRIMES.

487
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,671
JUSTICE IS WHY I'M HERE.

488
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,464
HEH HEH HEH.

489
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:36,843
SOME AMERICAN CASTAWAY
WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND,

490
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:40,138
SO YOU CAN SAY ALL
THE WORDS THAT
ANATOLY FEEDS YOU,

491
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,515
BUT YOU'LL NEVER BE
ONE OF US,

492
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:46,811
AND YOU SHOULD KNOW
BY NOW WHAT WE DO
TO OUTSIDERS.

493
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:49,605
VIKTOR, YOU COME
TOAST OUR NEW BROTHER?

494
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:51,482
YES, OF COURSE.

495
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,400
CONGRATULATIONS,
BROTHER.

496
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:58,990
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

497
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:01,408
THAT WAS NOTHING.

498
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,743
WHAT IS THIS?

499
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:03,870
BEST NOT ASK.

500
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,204
JUST DRINK.

501
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,459
HOW LONG YOU GONNA
BE STAYING HERE, MAN?

502
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:15,840
I'M A FUGITIVE, RENE.

503
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:18,968
I LIVE HERE,

504
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:23,139
AND UNTIL YOU HEAL UP,
WE'RE ROOMIES.

505
00:20:23,181 --> 00:20:25,224
SO YOU FEEL MUCH MORE
LIKE TALKING?

506
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:27,434
WHY DON'T WE TALK
ABOUT THE TIME YOU
WERE TORTURED?

507
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:34,316
SURE.

508
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:35,985
IT WAS ABOUT
A YEAR AGO.

509
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:40,031
MY BROTHER ANDY DID IT.

510
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:41,323
YOU GOT TORTURED
BY YOUR BROTHER?

511
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:42,783
MM-HMM.

512
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:46,037
HE WAS WORKING
WITH DAMIEN DARHK.

513
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:49,123
OLIVER SAID YOU
REENLISTED.
THAT WHY?

514
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:50,833
PARTLY.

515
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:53,211
THAT ALSO WHY YOU
SIDELINED YOURSELF?

516
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,962
-THAT, TOO.
-HMM.

517
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:56,714
SO YOU'RE
EX-NAVY, RIGHT?

518
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:58,674
DISHONORABLY DISCHARGED.

519
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:00,134
REASON?

520
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:02,136
YOU KNOW SOMETHING, MAN?
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME.

521
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:08,517
WE WERE TRANSPORTING
A PRISONER,

522
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:12,021
ONE WHO HAD INFORMATION
WE NEEDED.

523
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,314
INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS
COULDN'T GET IT
OUT OF HIM,

524
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,482
SO...

525
00:21:18,236 --> 00:21:19,737
I TRIED TO DO IT MY WAY.

526
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:21,197
YOU PUT A BEATING
ON HIM.

527
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:22,740
I'VE BEEN THINKING
A LOT ABOUT THAT
DECISION.

528
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:24,366
PARTICULARLY SINCE YOU'VE
BEEN ON THE OTHER SIDE

529
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:25,492
OF THAT BEAT-DOWN,
RIGHT?

530
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:29,455
BECAUSE I SCREWED UP
AGAIN.

531
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:32,083
THAT'S MY LIFE, MAN,

532
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,585
AND NOW YOU ASKING ME
TO RELIVE MY LATEST
AND GREATEST.

533
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:36,336
THAT'S RIGHT, RENE.

534
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:39,924
IF YOU WANT TO HELP US,

535
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:42,051
IF YOU WANT TO GIVE US
ANYTHING THAT COULD
BRING DOWN CHURCH,

536
00:21:42,093 --> 00:21:44,011
I'M AFRAID YOU'RE
GONNA HAVE TO.

537
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:55,189
OK.

538
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:58,025
WHAT DO I DO?

539
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:00,486
OLIVER: COUNCILMAN,
THANK YOU FOR
COMING BACK.

540
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:03,405
I'M AFRAID YOU'RE JUST
WASTING BOTH OF OUR TIMES.

541
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:06,117
MAYBE. AFTER YOU
EDUCATED US ON
QUEEN CONSOLIDATED,

542
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,244
THEA AND I THOUGHT
WE WOULD DO SOME
OF OUR OWN RESEARCH.

543
00:22:08,286 --> 00:22:09,996
YEAH, WE WERE
VERY CURIOUS TO FIND OUT

544
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:12,206
WHERE OUR FAMILY'S
BUSINESS WAS LOCATED.

545
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:13,707
HEH HEH.
HEH HEH HEH.

546
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,293
YOU WOULD NOT
BELIEVE HOW
SURPRISED

547
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,543
AND DELIGHTED
WE WERE TO FIND OUT

548
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,212
THAT YOU WERE ONE
OF THOSE, UM...

549
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:19,630
WHAT WAS...WHAT
WAS THE TERM

550
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:20,756
THE COUNCILMAN
USED?

551
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:22,549
-CRONY CAPITALISTS?
-RIGHT.

552
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:25,094
THAT YOU WERE ONE
OF THOSE CRONY
CAPITALISTS

553
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:27,471
WHO PUSHED
POOR PEOPLE OUT OF
THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS,

554
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:29,849
HIDING BEHIND
A SHELL COMPANY
OF COURSE.

555
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,725
THE SAME COMPANY WHO
OWNS CONTROLLING INTEREST

556
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:34,979
IN A REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER
WHO JUST FILED

557
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:36,939
FOR PERMITS TO REDEVELOP

559
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:40,318
OLIVER: YOUR OPPOSITION
TO THIS REZONING,

560
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:42,069
IT'S NOT POLITICAL.

561
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:43,696
IT'S...IT'S PERSONAL.
I GET IT.

562
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:45,281
YOU'RE TRYING
TO PROTECT
AN INVESTMENT.

ISN'T SHADOWING YOU
AT THE MOMENT,

564
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:50,703
BUT TO ME, THIS
FEELS LIKE A STORY
SHE WOULD LIKE,

565
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,412
SO SHOULD
I CALL HER?

566
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:56,292
UH, SHE ACTUALLY
GAVE ME HER NUMBER
THIS MORNING.

567
00:22:56,334 --> 00:22:59,253
ARE YOU BLACKMAILING
ME, MR. MAYOR?

568
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:02,631
WELL, COUNCILMAN,
IT'S LIKE YOU SAID,

569
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:04,133

GUY'S A CAREER POLITICIAN.

574
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,105
JUST NEEDED TO KNOW WHERE
TO APPLY THE PRESSURE.

575
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:20,358
HOW ARE YOU SO SURE
ABOUT ALL THIS?

576
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:22,235
I'M THE MAYOR
OF STAR CITY, THEA.

TO INFORM YOU THAT
AT 1:23 A.M.

584
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:08,406
MAYOR OLIVER QUEEN
WAS PRONOUNCED DEAD

SAY ANYTHING THAT NICE

592
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:30,052
ABOUT YOU WHEN YOU
WERE ALIVE.

AS A JOB DESCRIPTION

601
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:51,865
THAN IT DOES
AS A NICKNAME.
