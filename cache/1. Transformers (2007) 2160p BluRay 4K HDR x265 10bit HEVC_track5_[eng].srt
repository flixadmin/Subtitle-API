1
00:00:52,253 --> 00:00:57,050
<i>Before time began, there was the Cube.</i>

2
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:59,678
<i>We know not where it comes from,</i>

3
00:00:59,761 --> 00:01:06,059
<i>only that it holds the power
to create worlds and fill them with life.</i>

4
00:01:06,559 --> 00:01:09,646
<i>That is how our race was born.</i>

5
00:01:09,771 --> 00:01:12,190
<i>For a time, we lived in harmony,</i>

6
00:01:12,273 --> 00:01:18,905
<i>but like all great power,
some wanted it for good, others for evil.</i>

7
00:01:19,322 --> 00:01:22,117
<i>And so began the war,</i>

8
00:01:22,242 --> 00:01:27,288
<i>a war that ravaged our planet
until it was consumed by death,</i>

9
00:01:27,789 --> 00:01:32,502
<i>and the Cube was lost
to the far reaches of space.</i>

10
00:01:33,128 --> 00:01:38,883
<i>We scattered across the galaxy,
hoping to find it and rebuild our home,</i>

11
00:01:38,967 --> 00:01:43,513
<i>searching every star, every world.</i>

12
00:01:44,013 --> 00:01:49,978
<i>Andjust when all hope seemed lost,
message of a new discovery drew us</i>

13
00:01:50,103 --> 00:01:54,524
<i>to an unknown planet called Earth.</i>

14
00:02:01,364 --> 00:02:03,825
<i>But we were already too late.</i>

15
00:02:17,297 --> 00:02:19,340
Oh , God , five months of this.

16
00:02:19,466 --> 00:02:21,926
I can't wait to get a little taste of home.

17
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,095
A plate of mama's alligators <i>étouffée.</i>

18
00:02:24,179 --> 00:02:26,347
You've been talking
about barbecued 'gators and crickets

19
00:02:26,473 --> 00:02:29,601
for the last two weeks. I'm never going
to your mama's house, Fig . I promise.

20
00:02:29,684 --> 00:02:33,021
But Bobby, Bobby, 'gators are known
to have the most succulent meat.

21
00:02:33,146 --> 00:02:34,189
I understand .

22
00:02:37,817 --> 00:02:40,069
English , please. English .

23
00:02:40,195 --> 00:02:43,865
I mean , how many times have we. . .
We don't speak Spanish . I told you that.

24
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:46,201
Why you got to ruin it for me, man?
That's my heritage.

25
00:02:48,995 --> 00:02:50,205
Go with the Spanish . Whatever.

26
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:55,335
Hey, you guys remember weekends?
H uh? The Sox at Fenway.

27
00:02:55,418 --> 00:02:58,171
-Cold hotdog and a flat beer.
-Perfect day.

28
00:02:59,172 --> 00:03:02,217
What about you , Captain?
You got a perfect day?

29
00:03:02,509 --> 00:03:05,303
I just can't wait to hold my baby girl
for the first time.

30
00:03:05,386 --> 00:03:06,805
-He's adorable.
-That's too...

31
00:03:06,888 --> 00:03:08,056
Shut up !

32
00:03:26,908 --> 00:03:28,910
Hey, I'm ready to do this.

33
00:03:29,369 --> 00:03:31,913
Hey, any of y'all grow some balls,
come see me on the court, man .

34
00:03:32,038 --> 00:03:33,122
Hey, hey!

35
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,418
Watch this crossover, baby.

36
00:03:37,544 --> 00:03:40,713
Like Jordan in his prime,
pushing through the front line.

37
00:03:41,548 --> 00:03:43,675
-Step aside, ladies.
-Oh , man . What?

38
00:03:43,758 --> 00:03:46,052
-Lennox!
-Hey, what are you doing?

39
00:03:46,135 --> 00:03:48,763
-Water?
-Thank you .

40
00:03:48,972 --> 00:03:50,431
Are you gonna help me with the gear?

41
00:03:57,564 --> 00:04:01,943
Colonel Sharp, we have an inbound
unidentified infiltrator, 1 0 miles out.

42
00:04:06,656 --> 00:04:11,160
<i>Unidentified aircraft, you are
in restricted US military airspace.</i>

43
00:04:11,286 --> 00:04:14,080
Squawk ident and proceed east
out of the area.

44
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:20,003
Raptors one and two, snap to heading
two-five-zero to intercept.

45
00:04:20,128 --> 00:04:22,964
Bogie is in the weeds ten miles out,
not squawking .

46
00:04:27,635 --> 00:04:32,557
U nidentified aircraft, we will escort you
to US SOCCENT airbase.

47
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,810
If you do not comply,
we will use deadly force.

48
00:04:37,645 --> 00:04:39,105
Copy the bogie.

49
00:04:39,188 --> 00:04:41,774
<i>Tail 4500 X-ray.</i>

50
00:04:41,858 --> 00:04:44,360
Sir, says here 4500 X
was shot down three months ago.

51
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:46,279
-Afghanistan .
-That's got to be a mistake.

52
00:04:46,362 --> 00:04:48,448
-Check again , then recheck.
-I did , sir.

53
00:04:48,531 --> 00:04:50,533
A friend of mine was on that chopper.

54
00:04:51,326 --> 00:04:55,163
<i>Unidentified aircraft, we will escort you
to US SOCCENT airbase.</i>

55
00:04:57,332 --> 00:05:00,543
-Radar, where's the inbound?
-Bogie's five miles out, sir.

56
00:05:04,047 --> 00:05:05,840
-My wife on?
-Yes, Captain .

57
00:05:08,176 --> 00:05:09,844
-My ladies !
<i>-Look.</i>

58
00:05:10,136 --> 00:05:11,888
Oh , my goodness. Look at her.
She's getting so big .

59
00:05:12,013 --> 00:05:15,183
<i>Look at those cheeks.
Ijust wanna chew on them.</i>

60
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,976
<i>Baby, we made a good-looking kid.</i>

61
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,228
I know that people say that all the time,

62
00:05:19,354 --> 00:05:21,689
but, wow, we made
one good-looking kid . N ice work.

63
00:05:21,814 --> 00:05:23,566
She has your laugh .

64
00:05:23,691 --> 00:05:26,235
<i>-She laughed?</i>
-Her first one, yeah .

65
00:05:26,361 --> 00:05:29,280
<i>You sure she didn 'tjust fart?</i>

66
00:05:29,364 --> 00:05:31,199
No, she's a lady.

67
00:05:31,324 --> 00:05:33,826
She doesn't know you yet, but she will .

68
00:05:35,703 --> 00:05:38,206
4500 X. Something's not right.

69
00:05:43,211 --> 00:05:44,921
<i>Bogie's on the deck.</i>

70
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:48,216
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Radar's jammed .

71
00:05:49,676 --> 00:05:51,552
It's coming from the chopper.

72
00:05:51,928 --> 00:05:54,222
<i>-Will?</i>
-Sarah?

73
00:05:54,347 --> 00:05:58,184
Hey, Sarah , if you can hear me,
I love you and I'll be home soon .

74
00:06:01,229 --> 00:06:03,898
-To the right. Go to the right.
-Check fire.

75
00:06:07,694 --> 00:06:10,947
MH-53 pilot, power down now.

76
00:06:14,784 --> 00:06:17,286
Have your crew step out
or we will kill you .

77
00:06:26,295 --> 00:06:29,132
Hold your fire ! Stand by to engage !

78
00:06:36,264 --> 00:06:37,432
My God .

79
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:57,660
They bombed the antenna farm !
We're under attack!

80
00:07:25,521 --> 00:07:27,857
Go ! Move ! Move !

81
00:07:34,822 --> 00:07:36,532
It's going after the files !

82
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:37,992
Cut the hard lines !

83
00:07:38,117 --> 00:07:40,036
I need a key! It's locked !

84
00:07:41,871 --> 00:07:43,539
Move ! Move !

85
00:07:48,836 --> 00:07:51,297
Here, come here ! Come here !

86
00:08:06,562 --> 00:08:08,356
Here, hide in here !

87
00:08:08,648 --> 00:08:10,525
Oh , my God . Okay.

88
00:08:12,193 --> 00:08:13,236
No !

89
00:08:14,987 --> 00:08:16,030
Oh !

90
00:08:25,915 --> 00:08:27,750
What the...

91
00:08:36,592 --> 00:08:38,511
Epps, let's go !

92
00:08:58,614 --> 00:09:00,950
Okay, Mr. Witwicky, you're up.

93
00:09:01,784 --> 00:09:03,661
Sorry, I got a lot of stuff.

94
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:04,954
Watch .

95
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:06,205
Okay.

96
00:09:07,456 --> 00:09:08,791
For my family...

97
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:13,296
Who did . . . Who did that?
People ! Responsibility.

98
00:09:16,591 --> 00:09:17,717
Okay.

99
00:09:19,093 --> 00:09:20,720
So, for my family genealogy report,

100
00:09:20,803 --> 00:09:23,931
I decided to do it
on my great-great-grandfather,

101
00:09:24,265 --> 00:09:27,268
who was a famous man ,
Captain Archibald Witwicky.

102
00:09:27,727 --> 00:09:28,769
Very famous explorer.

103
00:09:28,895 --> 00:09:35,318
In fact, he was one of the first to explore
the Arctic Circle, which is a big deal .

104
00:09:37,111 --> 00:09:42,617
<i>In 1897, he took 41 brave sailors
straight into the Arctic Shelf</i>

105
00:09:43,576 --> 00:09:47,788
Move faster, men ! Move ! Chop ! Heave !

106
00:09:47,914 --> 00:09:53,294
The ice is freezing faster than
it's melting ! Chop faster! Heave, men !

107
00:09:53,502 --> 00:09:58,174
Heave ! No sacrifice, no victory!

108
00:09:58,299 --> 00:10:00,676
We'll get to the Arctic Circle, lads !

109
00:10:01,636 --> 00:10:03,888
So that's the story, right?

110
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:06,182
And here we have some of
the basic instruments and tools

111
00:10:06,307 --> 00:10:08,142
used by 1 9th-century seamen .

112
00:10:09,477 --> 00:10:11,437
This here is the quadrant,
which you can get for 80 bucks.

113
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,813
It's all for sale, by the way.

114
00:10:12,939 --> 00:10:17,652
Like the sextant here.
$50 for this, which is a bargain .

115
00:10:17,818 --> 00:10:20,238
These are pretty cool .
These are my grandfather's glasses.

116
00:10:20,321 --> 00:10:23,074
I haven't quite gotten them appraised
yet, but they've seen many cool things.

117
00:10:23,157 --> 00:10:25,409
Are you going to sell me his liver?

118
00:10:25,493 --> 00:10:28,079
Mr. Witwicky, this isn't show and sell .
It's the 11 th grade.

119
00:10:28,162 --> 00:10:29,330
I don't think your grandfather would be

120
00:10:29,413 --> 00:10:30,665
particularly proud of what you're doing .

121
00:10:30,748 --> 00:10:34,001
I know. I'm sorry. I just, you know,
this is all going towards my car fund .

122
00:10:34,085 --> 00:10:36,170
You can tell your folks. It's on eBay.
I take PayPal .

123
00:10:36,254 --> 00:10:37,588
Cold hard cash works, too.

124
00:10:37,672 --> 00:10:40,007
And the compass makes a great gift
for Columbus Day.

125
00:10:40,091 --> 00:10:41,425
-Sam !
-Sorry.

126
00:10:41,634 --> 00:10:43,344
U nfortunately,
my great-great-grandfather,

127
00:10:43,469 --> 00:10:48,266
the genius that he was, wound up
going blind and crazy in a psycho ward ,

128
00:10:48,349 --> 00:10:49,517
drawing these strange symbols

129
00:10:49,642 --> 00:10:52,103
and babbling on about
some giant ice man

130
00:10:52,186 --> 00:10:53,854
that he thought he'd discovered .

131
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:57,858
Okay. Might be a pop quiz tomorrow.
Might not.

132
00:10:57,942 --> 00:11:00,194
-Sleep in fear tonight.
-Here, you want? Here, 50. 40? 30?

133
00:11:00,319 --> 00:11:02,697
-Sam?
-Yeah . Sorry, sorry.

134
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:05,366
Okay. Pretty good , right?

135
00:11:06,701 --> 00:11:09,704
I'd say a solid B-.

136
00:11:11,289 --> 00:11:12,373
A B-?

137
00:11:12,498 --> 00:11:14,542
You were hawking
your great-grandfather's crap

138
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:15,793
-in my classroom .
-No, kids enjoy...

139
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:17,128
-Look, can you do me a favor?
-What?

140
00:11:17,211 --> 00:11:19,547
Can you look out the window
for a second? You see my father?

141
00:11:19,672 --> 00:11:21,215
-He's the guy in the green car.
-Yeah .

142
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,968
Okay, I wanna tell you about a dream .
A boy's dream .

143
00:11:24,051 --> 00:11:25,803
And a man's promise to that boy.

144
00:11:25,886 --> 00:11:28,723
He looked at me in the eye.
He said , "Son , I'm gonna buy you a car.

145
00:11:28,848 --> 00:11:31,142
"But I want you to bring me $2, 000
and three As."

146
00:11:31,225 --> 00:11:33,394
Okay? I got the 2, 000 and I got two As.

147
00:11:33,477 --> 00:11:37,565
Okay? Here's the dream . Your B-.
Dream gone. Kaput.

148
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,403
Sir, just ask yourself,
what would Jesus do?

149
00:11:43,863 --> 00:11:45,197
Yes ! Yes, yes.

150
00:11:46,699 --> 00:11:47,742
So?

151
00:11:47,867 --> 00:11:48,993
A-. It's an A, though .

152
00:11:49,076 --> 00:11:50,828
Wait, wait, wait. I can't see. It's an A.

153
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,663
-So I'm good?
-You're good .

154
00:11:53,414 --> 00:11:56,667
-I got a little surprise for you , son .
-What kind of...

155
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:59,003
Yeah , a little surprise.

156
00:12:00,004 --> 00:12:03,591
No. No, no, no, no. Dad !

157
00:12:04,592 --> 00:12:06,093
-Oh , you got to be kidding me.
-See?

158
00:12:06,218 --> 00:12:09,096
Yeah . I am .
You're not getting a Porsche.

159
00:12:12,266 --> 00:12:14,518
-You think that's funny?
-Yeah , I think it's funny.

160
00:12:14,602 --> 00:12:16,103
-What's wrong with you?
-You think I'd really get you

161
00:12:16,187 --> 00:12:18,856
a Porsche for your first car?

162
00:12:18,939 --> 00:12:21,108
I don't want to talk to you
for the rest of this whole thing .

163
00:12:21,233 --> 00:12:24,779
-Oh , come on . It's just a practical joke.
-It's not a funny joke.

164
00:12:27,365 --> 00:12:29,367
-Manny!
-What?

165
00:12:30,284 --> 00:12:31,952
Get your cousin out of
that damn clown suit.

166
00:12:32,036 --> 00:12:33,120
He's having a heat stroke again .

167
00:12:33,245 --> 00:12:34,372
Scaring white folks.

168
00:12:34,455 --> 00:12:36,999
I'm hot! Makeup's melting .
It hurts my eyes.

169
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:39,710
Here? No, no, no, what is this?
You said . . . You said half a car,

170
00:12:39,794 --> 00:12:41,379
not half a piece of crap, Dad .

171
00:12:41,462 --> 00:12:43,881
When I was your age, I'd have been
happy with four wheels and an engine.

172
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:45,466
Okay, let me explain
something to you . Okay?

173
00:12:45,549 --> 00:12:46,884
-You ever see <i>40-Year-Old Virgin ?</i>
-Yeah .

174
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:50,054
Okay, that's what this is.
And this is 50-year-old virgin .

175
00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:51,972
-Okay.
-You want me to live that life?

176
00:12:52,056 --> 00:12:54,225
-No sacrifice, no victory.
-Yeah , no victory. You know, I got it.

177
00:12:54,308 --> 00:12:55,643
-The old Witwicky motto, Dad .
-Right.

178
00:12:55,726 --> 00:12:56,811
Gentlemen .

179
00:12:57,812 --> 00:13:01,649
Bobby Bolivia, like the country,
except without the runs.

180
00:13:01,774 --> 00:13:02,817
How can I help you?

181
00:13:02,942 --> 00:13:05,736
Well , my son here,
looking to buy his first car.

182
00:13:06,612 --> 00:13:08,739
-You come to see me?
-I had to.

183
00:13:08,823 --> 00:13:13,160
That practically makes us family.
U ncle Bobby B, baby. U ncle Bobby B.

184
00:13:13,285 --> 00:13:15,663
-Sam .
-Sam , let me talk to you .

185
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:20,668
Sam , your first enchilada of freedom
awaits underneath one of those hoods.

186
00:13:21,335 --> 00:13:24,755
Let me tell you something , son .
A driver don't pick the car.

187
00:13:25,089 --> 00:13:26,757
The car'll pick the driver.

188
00:13:26,841 --> 00:13:29,677
It's a mystical bond
between man and machine.

189
00:13:29,802 --> 00:13:32,680
Son , I'm a lot of things,
but a liar's not one of them .

190
00:13:32,805 --> 00:13:37,351
Especially not in front of my mammy.
That's my mammy. Hey, Mammy!

191
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:42,106
Don't be like that.
If I had a rock, I'd bust your head , bitch .

192
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:44,275
I tell you , man , she deaf, you know?

193
00:13:46,861 --> 00:13:51,866
Well , over here, every piece of car
a man might want or need .

194
00:13:51,991 --> 00:13:53,451
This ain't bad .

195
00:13:54,702 --> 00:13:56,787
-This one's got racing stripes.
-Yeah .

196
00:13:56,871 --> 00:13:58,205
It got racing ...

197
00:13:58,831 --> 00:14:00,708
Yeah , what's this?
What the heck is this?

198
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:02,543
I don't know nothing about this car.

199
00:14:02,668 --> 00:14:03,878
-Manny!
-What?

200
00:14:04,003 --> 00:14:06,630
What is this? This car! Check it out!

201
00:14:06,714 --> 00:14:09,216
I don't know, boss ! I've never seen it!
That's <i>loco!</i>

202
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,802
Don't go Ricky Ricardo on me, Manny!
Find out!

203
00:14:11,886 --> 00:14:13,471
Feels good .

204
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,058
-How much?
-Well ,

205
00:14:19,894 --> 00:14:22,980
considering the semi-classic nature
of the vehicle,

206
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:24,899
with the slick wheels
and the custom paint job...

207
00:14:24,982 --> 00:14:29,069
-Yeah , but the paint's faded .
-Yeah , but it's custom .

208
00:14:29,153 --> 00:14:30,237
It's custom faded?

209
00:14:30,321 --> 00:14:33,073
Well , this is your first car.
I wouldn't expect you to understand .

210
00:14:33,157 --> 00:14:35,993
-Five grand .
-No, I'm not paying over four. Sorry.

211
00:14:36,368 --> 00:14:37,995
Kid , come on , get out. Get out the car.

212
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:39,663
No, no, no.
You said cars pick their drivers.

213
00:14:39,747 --> 00:14:42,917
Well , sometimes they pick a driver
with a cheap-ass father. Out the car.

214
00:14:43,042 --> 00:14:46,253
Now, this one here
for four Gs is a beaut.

215
00:14:46,337 --> 00:14:48,422
There's a Fiesta with racing stripes
over there.

216
00:14:48,547 --> 00:14:51,175
No, I don't want a Fiesta
with racing stripes.

217
00:14:51,258 --> 00:14:53,260
This is a classic engine right here.

218
00:14:53,385 --> 00:14:55,763
I sold a car the other day...

219
00:14:57,765 --> 00:14:59,183
Gee. Holy cow.

220
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:00,768
-No, no, no. No worries.
-You all right?

221
00:15:00,851 --> 00:15:04,605
I'll get a sledgehammer and knock
this right out. Hey, hey, Manny!

222
00:15:04,688 --> 00:15:06,357
Get your clown cousin
and get some hammers

223
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,609
and come bang this stuff out, baby!

224
00:15:09,443 --> 00:15:10,611
<i>...greater than man...</i>

225
00:15:10,736 --> 00:15:13,864
That one's my favorite,
drove all the way from Alabammy.

226
00:15:30,798 --> 00:15:31,924
$4, 000.

227
00:15:44,728 --> 00:15:45,896
Steve.

228
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,898
Hello, Mr. Secretary.

229
00:15:49,817 --> 00:15:51,485
They're so young .

230
00:15:51,569 --> 00:15:53,737
They're the top
subject matter experts, sir.

231
00:15:53,821 --> 00:15:56,073
NSA's recruiting right out of
high school these days.

232
00:15:56,156 --> 00:15:59,577
Guys, that's the Secretary of Defense.

233
00:16:00,828 --> 00:16:02,663
I am so underdressed .

234
00:16:02,746 --> 00:16:05,791
Ladies and gentlemen ,
the Secretary of Defense.

235
00:16:07,626 --> 00:16:09,336
Please be seated .

236
00:16:10,629 --> 00:16:12,339
I'm John Keller.

237
00:16:12,423 --> 00:16:15,676
Obviously, you're wondering
why you're here, so these are the facts.

238
00:16:17,011 --> 00:16:19,013
<i>At 1900 local time yesterday,</i>

239
00:16:19,096 --> 00:16:22,308
<i>the SOCCENT Forward Operations
Base in Qatar was attacked.</i>

240
00:16:22,474 --> 00:16:25,769
So far as we know,
there were no survivors.

241
00:16:26,103 --> 00:16:29,481
The objective of the attack
was to hack our military network.

242
00:16:30,024 --> 00:16:31,692
We're not sure
exactly what they're after,

243
00:16:31,775 --> 00:16:35,195
but we do know that
they were cut off during the assault,

244
00:16:35,321 --> 00:16:39,199
which would lead us to assume
that they're going to try it again .

245
00:16:39,617 --> 00:16:42,620
Now, no one's taken responsibility
for the attack.

246
00:16:42,703 --> 00:16:46,707
And the only real lead we have so far
is this sound .

247
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:56,008
That's the signal
that hacked our network.

248
00:16:57,384 --> 00:17:00,554
NSA's working at full capacity
to analyze it

249
00:17:00,638 --> 00:17:02,139
and intercept further communications,

250
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:05,059
but we need your help
to find out who did this.

251
00:17:05,142 --> 00:17:09,355
Now, you've all shown considerable
ability in the area of signals analysis.

252
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:12,066
We're on a hair-trigger here, people.

253
00:17:12,566 --> 00:17:14,735
The President has dispatched
battle groups

254
00:17:14,818 --> 00:17:18,989
<i>to the Arabian Gulf and Yellow Sea.
This is as real as it's ever gonna get.</i>

255
00:17:19,073 --> 00:17:20,741
<i>Now I'm gonna leave you
to your officer-in-charge.</i>

256
00:17:20,824 --> 00:17:23,744
You'll break up into teams
and you'll start your work.

257
00:17:23,827 --> 00:17:25,412
Good luck to us all .

258
00:17:34,755 --> 00:17:38,258
All right, Mojo. I got the car.
Now I need the girl .

259
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:43,847
I need money to take out the girl
is what I need .

260
00:17:44,056 --> 00:17:45,140
Zero bids.

261
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,936
Great. Broke.

262
00:17:49,061 --> 00:17:51,438
Come on , Mojo.
You want your pain pills?

263
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,775
No. Premature.

264
00:17:54,858 --> 00:17:56,193
Good . What's up?

265
00:17:56,276 --> 00:17:59,113
Nothing . You know, just driving my car.
Driving my car.

266
00:18:01,448 --> 00:18:02,616
It's like clockwork.

267
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,284
All right, I know you get wasted
on these things,

268
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:07,454
but if you piss in my bed again ,
you're sleeping outside. Okay?

269
00:18:07,579 --> 00:18:09,873
That's it for today. No more. Crackhead .

270
00:18:09,957 --> 00:18:14,128
-Ron , this one is uneven .
-Yeah . Probably.

271
00:18:14,211 --> 00:18:15,379
This one is wobbly.

272
00:18:15,462 --> 00:18:19,633
-Yeah . I'll take care of that real soon .
-Couldn't we have hired a professional?

273
00:18:19,717 --> 00:18:20,801
-Sam . . .
-What?

274
00:18:20,926 --> 00:18:23,470
I do not like footprints on my grass.

275
00:18:23,595 --> 00:18:25,806
-What foot. . . There's no footprints.
-That's why I built my path .

276
00:18:25,889 --> 00:18:27,558
So why don't you go from my grass
onto my path , okay?

277
00:18:27,641 --> 00:18:29,810
-It's family grass, Dad .
-Well , when you own your own grass,

278
00:18:29,935 --> 00:18:31,895
-you'll understand .
-This. . . I can't do it anymore.

279
00:18:31,979 --> 00:18:33,147
You're putting girl jewelry
on a boy dog .

280
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:34,231
What?

281
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:36,692
He's got enough self-esteem issues
as a Chihuahua, Mom .

282
00:18:36,775 --> 00:18:38,485
That's his bling .

283
00:18:38,569 --> 00:18:40,487
I want you home at 11 : 00 !

284
00:18:40,571 --> 00:18:42,406
-Yeah , all right.
-11 : 00 !

285
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:44,658
Please, for the love of God , drive safely.

286
00:18:44,783 --> 00:18:45,993
Seat belt on !

287
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:56,003
Wow. You are so cheap.

288
00:18:57,254 --> 00:19:00,132
Well , it's his first car.
Supposed to be like that.

289
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:10,517
<i>At this time, we can 't confirm
whether there were any survivors.</i>

290
00:19:10,851 --> 00:19:12,019
Oh , my God .

291
00:19:12,102 --> 00:19:14,938
<i>Our bases worldwide are, as of now,
at DEFCON Delta,</i>

292
00:19:15,022 --> 00:19:17,191
<i>our highest readiness level.</i>

293
00:19:18,484 --> 00:19:20,194
We're dealing with
a very effective weapons system

294
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:22,696
that we have not come across before.

295
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:25,616
<i>But our prayers are with the families
of the brave men and women...</i>

296
00:19:25,699 --> 00:19:27,451
Honey, Daddy's gonna be okay.

297
00:19:28,535 --> 00:19:31,121
I've never seen a weapons system
like this.

298
00:19:31,205 --> 00:19:33,957
The thermal shows this weird aura
around the exoskeleton

299
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:37,044
like it's cloaked
by some kind of invisible force field .

300
00:19:37,169 --> 00:19:39,379
That's impossible. There's no
such thing as invisible force fields

301
00:19:39,505 --> 00:19:41,632
except in , like, comic book stuff, right?

302
00:19:41,715 --> 00:19:43,050
-Man , I don't know.
-What is that?

303
00:19:43,175 --> 00:19:45,302
My mama, she had the gift, you know?

304
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:48,347
She saw things. I got the gene, too,

305
00:19:48,722 --> 00:19:52,351
and that thing that attacked us?
I got a feeling it ain't over.

306
00:19:53,185 --> 00:19:54,978
How about you use
those magic voodoo powers

307
00:19:55,062 --> 00:19:56,647
and get us the hell out of here, huh?

308
00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:01,068
When I took that picture,
I think it saw me.

309
00:20:03,362 --> 00:20:05,072
It looked right at me.

310
00:20:05,697 --> 00:20:08,075
All right, we got to get this thing
back to the Pentagon right away.

311
00:20:08,158 --> 00:20:09,576
They got to know what
we're dealing with here.

312
00:20:09,701 --> 00:20:11,036
<i>My radio's fried.</i>

313
00:20:11,537 --> 00:20:14,164
<i>-I got no communication with aerial.
-Hey, Mahfouz.</i>

314
00:20:14,248 --> 00:20:17,167
-How far do you live from here?
-Not far. J ust up that mountain .

315
00:20:17,251 --> 00:20:18,836
-Do they have a phone?
-Yes.

316
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:20,587
All right, let's hit it.

317
00:20:24,049 --> 00:20:26,343
Dude, are you sure
we're invited to this party?

318
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:30,389
Of course, Miles.
It's a lake. Public property.

319
00:20:32,182 --> 00:20:33,267
Oh , my God .

320
00:20:33,725 --> 00:20:36,937
Oh , my God , dude, Mikaela's here.
J ust don't do anything weird , all right?

321
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,605
-I'm good , right?
-Yeah , you're good .

322
00:20:38,689 --> 00:20:39,773
Okay.

323
00:20:43,569 --> 00:20:46,363
Hey, guys, check it out.

324
00:20:46,697 --> 00:20:47,823
Oh , hi .

325
00:20:47,906 --> 00:20:52,035
Hey, bro. That car. It's nice. Hey.

326
00:20:57,124 --> 00:20:59,251
So, what are you guys doing here?

327
00:20:59,918 --> 00:21:01,837
We're here to climb this tree.

328
00:21:02,546 --> 00:21:04,423
I see that. It looks. . . It looks fun .

329
00:21:04,506 --> 00:21:06,008
-Yeah .
-You know, I thought I recognized you .

330
00:21:06,091 --> 00:21:09,094
You tried out for the football team
last year, right?

331
00:21:10,596 --> 00:21:11,930
Let's go call your mom .

332
00:21:12,014 --> 00:21:15,934
Oh , no, no, that. . . No.
That wasn't like a real tryout.

333
00:21:16,018 --> 00:21:18,770
I was researching a book I was writing .

334
00:21:18,854 --> 00:21:20,147
-Oh , yeah?
-Yeah .

335
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:22,608
Yeah? What's it about?
Sucking at sports?

336
00:21:24,109 --> 00:21:27,779
No, it's about the link between
brain damage and football .

337
00:21:27,863 --> 00:21:30,115
No, it's a good book.
Your friends'll love it.

338
00:21:30,198 --> 00:21:33,368
You know, it's got mazes in it and ,
you know, little coloring areas,

339
00:21:33,452 --> 00:21:36,038
sections, pop-up pictures.
It's a lot of fun .

340
00:21:36,622 --> 00:21:37,831
That's funny.

341
00:21:38,457 --> 00:21:40,626
Okay, okay. You know what? Stop.

342
00:21:43,462 --> 00:21:45,714
Hey, guys, I know of a party.
Let's go, let's head .

343
00:21:45,797 --> 00:21:47,883
You got to get out
of the tree right now. Get...

344
00:21:47,966 --> 00:21:50,594
J ust get out of the tree
right now, please.

345
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:52,721
What are you doing?

346
00:21:52,804 --> 00:21:54,890
Did you see that dismount?
All the chicks were watching .

347
00:21:54,973 --> 00:21:57,434
You're making me look like an idiot.
We both looked like idiots just now.

348
00:21:57,517 --> 00:22:00,812
-Hey, how about you let me drive?
-Oh , no. No, no, no. This is not a toy.

349
00:22:00,896 --> 00:22:03,857
These 22s, I don't want you
grinding them . No.

350
00:22:03,941 --> 00:22:06,985
Why doesn't my little bunny
just hop in the back seat?

351
00:22:07,903 --> 00:22:11,323
God , I can't even tell you how much
I'm not your little bunny.

352
00:22:12,866 --> 00:22:13,992
Okay.

353
00:22:15,327 --> 00:22:16,828
You'll call me.

354
00:22:23,168 --> 00:22:26,129
<i>Who's gonna drive you home, tonight?</i>

355
00:22:26,213 --> 00:22:27,714
Hey, man , what's wrong
with your radio?

356
00:22:27,798 --> 00:22:29,716
-I'm gonna drive her home tonight.
-What?

357
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,469
She's an evil jock concubine, man .
Let her hitchhike.

358
00:22:32,552 --> 00:22:34,137
She lives 1 0 miles from here, okay?
It's my only chance.

359
00:22:34,221 --> 00:22:35,555
You got to be understanding
here, all right?

360
00:22:35,639 --> 00:22:37,057
All right. We'll put her in the back.
I'll be quiet.

361
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,809
-Did you say, "Put her in the back"?
-I called shotgun .

362
00:22:38,892 --> 00:22:40,644
I'm not putting her in the back.
You got to get out of my car.

363
00:22:40,727 --> 00:22:42,145
-That's a party foul .
-What rules?

364
00:22:42,229 --> 00:22:43,397
Bros before hos.

365
00:22:43,522 --> 00:22:45,315
Miles, I'm begging you to get out
of my car. Okay?

366
00:22:45,399 --> 00:22:46,483
You can't do this to me.

367
00:22:46,566 --> 00:22:48,068
You got to get out of my car right now.

368
00:22:52,406 --> 00:22:55,826
<i>Who's gonna come around
when you break?</i>

369
00:22:55,909 --> 00:22:58,829
Mikaela ! It's Sam .

370
00:22:58,912 --> 00:22:59,997
Witwicky.

371
00:23:00,414 --> 00:23:02,499
I hope I didn't get you
stranded or anything .

372
00:23:02,582 --> 00:23:03,667
You sure?

373
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,585
So, listen , I was wondering
if I could ride you home.

374
00:23:05,669 --> 00:23:09,172
I mean , give you a ride home
in my car, to your house.

375
00:23:10,173 --> 00:23:11,383
There you go.

376
00:23:18,515 --> 00:23:19,599
So...

377
00:23:23,353 --> 00:23:25,772
I can't believe that I'm here right now.

378
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:29,860
You can duck down if you want.
I mean , it won't hurt my feelings.

379
00:23:29,943 --> 00:23:31,945
Oh , no, no, no.
I didn't mean here with you .

380
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:37,284
I just meant here, like, in this situation ,
this same situation that I'm always in .

381
00:23:37,409 --> 00:23:40,370
'Cause, I don't know, I guess I just
have a weakness for hot guys,

382
00:23:40,454 --> 00:23:44,041
for tight abs and really big arms.

383
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:45,709
Big arms?

384
00:23:47,627 --> 00:23:50,464
Well , there's a couple new additions
in the car.

385
00:23:50,547 --> 00:23:53,050
Like, I just put in that light there.

386
00:23:53,592 --> 00:23:57,596
And that disco ball . And so the light
reflects off the disco ball .

387
00:23:59,473 --> 00:24:00,557
Yeah .

388
00:24:03,643 --> 00:24:07,064
Are you new to school this year?
It's your first year here?

389
00:24:07,147 --> 00:24:09,066
Oh , no, no.

390
00:24:09,149 --> 00:24:11,068
We've been in the same school
since first grade.

391
00:24:11,151 --> 00:24:12,444
-Really?
-Yeah .

392
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:14,154
Yeah , a long time.

393
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:16,156
Well , do we have any classes together?

394
00:24:16,281 --> 00:24:17,824
-Yeah , yeah .
-Really? Which?

395
00:24:17,949 --> 00:24:21,411
H istory. Language arts. Math . Science.

396
00:24:21,495 --> 00:24:22,788
-Sam .
-Sam . Yeah .

397
00:24:22,871 --> 00:24:26,333
-Sam Wilkicky.
-Witwicky.

398
00:24:26,458 --> 00:24:28,085
God , you know what? I'm so sorry.
I just...

399
00:24:28,168 --> 00:24:29,878
-No, it's cool .
-I just didn't recognize you .

400
00:24:30,003 --> 00:24:32,464
Yeah , well , I mean ,
that's understandable.

401
00:24:33,632 --> 00:24:36,468
No, no, no. No. Come on .

402
00:24:37,803 --> 00:24:40,222
Sorry, I'm just working out the kinks.
You know, it's a new car.

403
00:24:41,181 --> 00:24:43,809
<i>When I get that feeling
I want sexual healing</i>

404
00:24:43,892 --> 00:24:46,645
This radio is, like, you know. . .
It's an old radio, too, so...

405
00:24:46,728 --> 00:24:48,438
<i>Sexual healing</i>

406
00:24:48,522 --> 00:24:50,774
Look, this isn't something that I ,
you know...

407
00:24:50,857 --> 00:24:53,860
I can't get this radio to stop.
Look, I wouldn't try this on you .

408
00:24:53,985 --> 00:24:56,363
'Cause this is like a romantic thing
that I'm not trying to do.

409
00:24:56,488 --> 00:24:58,156
Not that you're not worthy
of trying something like this on .

410
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,574
-No, of course not.
-I'm a friend of yours.

411
00:24:59,699 --> 00:25:02,035
I'm not a romantic friend .
Romantic friends do this.

412
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,205
I mean , I'm not that friend .
I mean , we. . . I could be.

413
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,790
<i>I feel good</i>

414
00:25:06,873 --> 00:25:08,333
J ust pop the hood .

415
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:11,920
Stupid . Shut up, shut up, shut up.

416
00:25:14,381 --> 00:25:15,590
Whoa, nice headers.

417
00:25:15,715 --> 00:25:17,259
You've got a high-rise
double-pump carburetor.

418
00:25:17,384 --> 00:25:19,761
That's pretty impressive, Sam .

419
00:25:19,886 --> 00:25:21,096
Double-pump?

420
00:25:21,221 --> 00:25:23,932
It squirts the fuel in
so you can go faster.

421
00:25:25,934 --> 00:25:27,727
I like to go faster.

422
00:25:27,894 --> 00:25:31,731
And it looks like
your distributor cap's a little loose.

423
00:25:32,941 --> 00:25:34,693
Yeah? How'd you know that?

424
00:25:35,777 --> 00:25:39,781
My dad . He was a real grease monkey.
He taught me all about this.

425
00:25:39,906 --> 00:25:43,326
I could take it all apart, clean it,
put it back together.

426
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:45,537
That's weird .
I just wouldn't peg you for mechanical .

427
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:46,746
Oh , my God .

428
00:25:46,872 --> 00:25:48,415
Well , you know,
I don't really broadcast it.

429
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:51,543
Guys don't like it when you know
more about cars than they do.

430
00:25:51,626 --> 00:25:54,296
Especially not Trent. He hates it.

431
00:25:54,421 --> 00:25:57,257
Yeah , no, I'm cool with , you know,
females working on my engine.

432
00:25:57,382 --> 00:25:58,925
I prefer it, actually.

433
00:25:59,593 --> 00:26:01,887
-Okay. You want to fire it up for me?
-Oh , yeah , yeah , no problem .

434
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:04,181
-Thanks.
-You know, I was thinking .

435
00:26:04,264 --> 00:26:07,767
You know, if Trent's such a jerk,
why do you hang out with him?

436
00:26:09,978 --> 00:26:12,606
You know what? I'm just. . .
I'm gonna walk.

437
00:26:12,731 --> 00:26:14,399
Good luck with your car.

438
00:26:16,735 --> 00:26:17,819
All right.

439
00:26:17,944 --> 00:26:19,905
Walking's healthy, right?

440
00:26:20,989 --> 00:26:23,283
Oh , God , no, no, no, no, no, no.

441
00:26:23,617 --> 00:26:25,911
Come on , please.
Please, you gotta work for me now.

442
00:26:25,994 --> 00:26:28,830
Don't let her walk away. Come on ,
come on , come on . Please, please.

443
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:33,460
<i>Baby come back

444

<i>There was something

447
00:26:44,137 --> 00:26:45,472
Hey!

448
00:26:48,016 --> 00:26:49,768
Wait a second !

<i>I was wrong

There it is.

451
00:26:57,150 --> 00:27:01,029
I had fun .
So, you know, thanks for listening .

452
00:27:01,529 --> 00:27:05,784
-Oh , yeah , yeah .
-You . . . You think I'm shallow?

453
00:27:06,993 --> 00:27:10,038
I think you're. . . No, no, no. I think...

454
00:27:10,497 --> 00:27:14,793
I think there's a lot more
than meets the eye with you .

455
00:27:16,711 --> 00:27:17,837
Okay.

456
00:27:18,546 --> 00:27:19,673
Yeah .

457
00:27:19,798 --> 00:27:22,300
All right, I'll see you at school .

458
00:27:22,384 --> 00:27:23,510
All right.

459
00:27:29,349 --> 00:27:30,850
That's stupid .

460
00:27:31,059 --> 00:27:32,185
That was a stupid line.

461
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:35,146
"There's a lot more than meets
the eye with you ." Stupid .

462
00:27:37,524 --> 00:27:38,858
Oh , God .

463
00:27:40,318 --> 00:27:41,861
Oh , my God . I love my car.

464
00:27:52,872 --> 00:27:58,420
Hey, guys, I think the other team
figured it out. Iran .

465
00:27:58,545 --> 00:28:02,215
Come on , man . This is way too smart
for Iranian scientists.

466
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:06,052
-Think about it.
-What do you think, kid? Chinese?

467
00:28:06,553 --> 00:28:08,763
No way. This is nothing like
what the Chinese are using .

468
00:28:12,392 --> 00:28:14,269
This is Air Force One.
Level of flight, level three-three-zero.

469
00:28:14,394 --> 00:28:16,438
<i>We will hunt down this enemy.
And when we do,</i>

470
00:28:16,563 --> 00:28:18,732
<i>we'll knowjust what to do with them.</i>

471
00:28:19,232 --> 00:28:21,443
-Thank you .
-You're welcome.

472
00:28:38,251 --> 00:28:39,878
<i>Apparently, there are
very few survivors.</i>

473
00:28:39,961 --> 00:28:41,171
Yes, Mr. President?

474
00:28:41,254 --> 00:28:44,257
Yeah , can you wrangle me up
some Ding Dongs, darling?

475
00:28:56,311 --> 00:29:00,440
I joined the Air Force to bring the man
Ding Dongs. I'll be in storage.

476
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:26,966
Shoot.

477
00:29:40,897 --> 00:29:42,482
Gross.

478
00:30:09,676 --> 00:30:11,344
Do you hear that?

479
00:30:14,264 --> 00:30:15,849
Are you getting this?

480
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:18,518
I think they're hacking
the network again .

481
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:36,870
Oh , my God . This is a direct match
to the signal in Qatar.

482
00:30:36,953 --> 00:30:38,788
-Are you running a diagnostic?
-Should I be?

483
00:30:38,872 --> 00:30:40,874
-Yes, you should .
-So I am .

484
00:30:52,051 --> 00:30:54,304
Someone !
They're hacking into Air Force One !

485
00:30:54,387 --> 00:30:55,930
We need a senior analyst.

486
00:30:56,055 --> 00:30:57,891
-I think they're planting a virus.
-A virus?

487
00:30:57,974 --> 00:31:00,560
-It's streaming right now.
-They are planting a virus

488
00:31:00,643 --> 00:31:03,855
and stealing a whole lot of data
from your system at the same time.

489
00:31:03,938 --> 00:31:05,482
Code Red . We have a breach .

490
00:31:05,565 --> 00:31:08,318
Air Force One, someone onboard
has breached the military network.

491
00:31:08,401 --> 00:31:11,237
I'm in the cargo hold . Clear. Clear.

492
00:31:15,742 --> 00:31:17,202
-You got to cut the hard lines.
-What?

493
00:31:17,285 --> 00:31:20,413
-Whatever they want, they are getting it.
-Sir?

494
00:31:20,497 --> 00:31:23,249
Permission to take down
the Defense Network.

495
00:31:23,333 --> 00:31:27,337
-Cut all server hard lines now.
-Cut all server hard lines now.

496
00:31:48,942 --> 00:31:51,778
Someone's tampered
with the POTUS mainframe.

497
00:31:51,861 --> 00:31:53,321
What the...

498
00:31:58,785 --> 00:32:01,204
<i>Shots fired in the underdeck.
Repeat, shots fired.</i>

499
00:32:01,287 --> 00:32:04,123
<i>Crew, prepare for emergency descent.</i>

500
00:32:22,183 --> 00:32:24,227
I want our President in that bunker.

501
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:28,356
And I don't want to discuss a damn
thing other till that becomes reality.

502
00:32:28,481 --> 00:32:31,568
That's our first priority.
That's our only priority right now.

503
00:32:31,651 --> 00:32:32,819
Air Force One is on the ground .

504
00:33:36,883 --> 00:33:39,552
Oh , God . No, no, no, no, no, no, no !

505
00:33:40,386 --> 00:33:41,929
That's my car!

506
00:33:43,389 --> 00:33:44,724
No !

507
00:33:46,851 --> 00:33:47,935
No, no, no, no.

508
00:33:55,443 --> 00:33:57,570
Dad , call the cops !

509
00:33:59,364 --> 00:34:02,492
Where you going with my car, buddy?
Where you going?

510
00:34:02,575 --> 00:34:06,329
Hello? 911 emergency!
My car has been stolen !

511
00:34:06,412 --> 00:34:09,916
I'm in pursuit! Right?
I need all units, the whole squadron .

512
00:34:10,041 --> 00:34:12,794
Bring everyone !
No, don't ask me questions, all right?

513
00:34:12,919 --> 00:34:15,588
My father's the head
of the neighborhood watch !

514
00:34:48,162 --> 00:34:49,789
Oh , my God .

515
00:35:06,139 --> 00:35:07,598
My name is Sam Witwicky.

516
00:35:07,682 --> 00:35:11,644
Whoever finds this, my car is alive,
okay? You saw that?

517
00:35:11,769 --> 00:35:14,480
Since this is my last words on Earth ,
I just wanna say, Mom , Dad , I love you ,

518
00:35:14,605 --> 00:35:16,941
and if you find <i>Busty Beauties</i>
under my bed , it wasn't mine.

519
00:35:17,024 --> 00:35:19,026
I'm holding it for Miles.
No, no, wait that...

520
00:35:19,152 --> 00:35:21,821
Okay, that's not true. It's mine
and U ncle Charles gave it to me.

521
00:35:21,904 --> 00:35:23,906
I'm sorry. Mojo, I love you .

522
00:35:35,501 --> 00:35:37,670
No ! No ! No ! No !

523
00:35:41,174 --> 00:35:42,592
Oh , my God .

524
00:35:43,134 --> 00:35:45,678
No, you're a good dog !
Good dog ! Good dog !

525
00:35:45,845 --> 00:35:47,013
Oh , my God .

526
00:35:50,266 --> 00:35:55,021
Whoa ! Hey, hey, hey! All right! Oh !
No ! No !

527
00:35:57,857 --> 00:35:59,275
Okay. Please, please don't kill me !

528
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:02,695
I'm sorry! Take the keys !
I don't want them ! Car's yours !

529
00:36:04,489 --> 00:36:06,949
Listen , listen , listen .

530
00:36:07,033 --> 00:36:08,367
-Good , you're here.
-Let me see your hands !

531
00:36:08,493 --> 00:36:10,036
-No, no, no ! It's not me !
-Let me see your hands.

532
00:36:10,161 --> 00:36:13,206
-The guy's inside.
-Shut up ! Walk towards the car.

533
00:36:15,124 --> 00:36:16,876
Put your head on the hood .

534
00:36:30,139 --> 00:36:32,892
Whoever did this finally managed
to infiltrate our defense network,

535
00:36:33,017 --> 00:36:35,561
which is what they tried to do in Qatar,
only this time it worked .

536
00:36:35,645 --> 00:36:37,313
-What did they get?
-We still don't know.

537
00:36:37,396 --> 00:36:40,483
-Talk to me about the virus.
-It's a Spider-bot virus.

538
00:36:40,566 --> 00:36:43,236
We're not sure what it's going to do,
but it may cripple the system .

539
00:36:43,361 --> 00:36:45,321
-Can we stop it?
-Every time we try an antivirus,

540
00:36:45,404 --> 00:36:47,990
it adapts and speeds up.
It's like it's not a virus anymore.

541
00:36:48,074 --> 00:36:49,158
It's become the system .

542
00:36:49,242 --> 00:36:52,411
Obviously the first phase
of a major attack against the US.

543
00:36:52,537 --> 00:36:54,163
The only countries
with this kind of capability

544
00:36:54,247 --> 00:36:56,499
are Russia, North Korea, maybe China.

545
00:36:56,582 --> 00:36:59,585
-I'm sorry, that's not correct.
-Excuse me, young lady.

546
00:36:59,669 --> 00:37:01,921
I didn't see you standing there.
You would be who?

547
00:37:02,004 --> 00:37:03,840
I'm just the analyst
who detected the hack.

548
00:37:03,923 --> 00:37:07,093
Hold on . It was you? You did it?

549
00:37:07,426 --> 00:37:10,179
-Her team .
-Sir, I was just trying to say,

550
00:37:10,263 --> 00:37:12,932
they hacked your firewall in 1 0 seconds.

551
00:37:13,057 --> 00:37:15,685
Okay. Even a supercomputer
with a brute force attack

552
00:37:15,768 --> 00:37:17,520
would take 20 years to do that.

553
00:37:17,603 --> 00:37:20,106
Maybe you can explain , then ,
how our latest satellite imagery

554
00:37:20,231 --> 00:37:22,525
shows North Korea
doubling its naval activity.

555
00:37:22,608 --> 00:37:26,195
Maybe it's a precaution ,
because isn't that what we're doing?

556
00:37:26,279 --> 00:37:29,615
The signal pattern is learning .
It's evolving on its own .

557
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:32,034
And you need to
move past Fourier transfers

558
00:37:32,118 --> 00:37:34,287
and start considering
quantum mechanics.

559
00:37:34,412 --> 00:37:36,706
There is nothing on Earth that complex.

560
00:37:36,789 --> 00:37:39,375
What about an organism?
A living organism?

561
00:37:39,458 --> 00:37:41,878
Maybe some kind of
DNA-based computer?

562
00:37:41,961 --> 00:37:45,631
-And I know that that sounds crazy. . .
-That's enough . That's enough .

563
00:37:46,048 --> 00:37:48,634
We have six floors of analysts
working on this thing .

564
00:37:48,759 --> 00:37:51,053
Now, if you can find proof to back up
your theory,

565
00:37:51,137 --> 00:37:53,723
I'm gonna be happy to listen to you .
But if you don't get a filter

566
00:37:53,806 --> 00:37:57,727
on that brain-mouth thing , you're gonna
be off the team . You understand?

567
00:38:03,149 --> 00:38:06,652
Look, I can't be any clearer
than how crystal clear I am being .

568
00:38:07,486 --> 00:38:09,906
-It just stood up.
-It just stood up.

569
00:38:11,407 --> 00:38:13,159
Wow. That's really neat.

570
00:38:14,118 --> 00:38:15,411
Okay, chiefie.

571
00:38:15,745 --> 00:38:18,581
Time to fill her up. And no drippy-drippy.

572
00:38:19,081 --> 00:38:20,416
What are you rolling?

573
00:38:20,499 --> 00:38:22,919
Whippets? Goofballs?
A little wowie sauce with the boys?

574
00:38:23,002 --> 00:38:25,338
-No, I'm not on any drugs.
-What's these?

575
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:28,966
Found it in your pocket. "Mojo."

576
00:38:30,176 --> 00:38:32,845
Is that what the kids are doing now?
Little bit of Mojo?

577
00:38:32,929 --> 00:38:36,599
-Those are my dog's pain pills.
-You know, a Chihuahua. A little...

578
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:41,812
What was that?

579
00:38:43,439 --> 00:38:46,651
You eyeballing my piece, 50 Cent?

580
00:38:47,777 --> 00:38:51,280
You wanna go?
Make something happen . Do it.

581
00:38:51,364 --> 00:38:54,617
'Cause I promise you I will bust you up.

582
00:38:55,952 --> 00:38:57,161
Are you on drugs?

583
00:39:05,795 --> 00:39:08,047
Let's hope this telephone line works.

584
00:39:10,549 --> 00:39:13,052
Hey, heads up !

585
00:39:13,135 --> 00:39:16,806
Heads up ! Hey! Heads up !

586
00:39:21,686 --> 00:39:23,688
What the heck was that?

587
00:39:28,317 --> 00:39:30,695
English , dude. English .

588
00:39:37,076 --> 00:39:38,244
Whoa !

589
00:39:38,869 --> 00:39:40,413
Watch out!

590
00:39:46,669 --> 00:39:49,171
-Open fire !
-Contact! Contact!

591
00:39:49,255 --> 00:39:50,339
Everybody, quiet. Settle.

592
00:39:50,423 --> 00:39:52,550
Whoa, mother. . . What the hell is...

593
00:40:00,266 --> 00:40:03,060
Get up ! Get up ! Come on !

594
00:40:10,151 --> 00:40:11,986
Go ! Move it!

595
00:40:24,206 --> 00:40:26,375
Take cover!

596
00:40:28,711 --> 00:40:30,755
Fig ! Cover the rear!

597
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:36,302
Cover fire ! Move it! Fig , cover the rear!
Epps ! Cover the rear! Move it!

598
00:40:36,385 --> 00:40:39,430
Come on ! Give me a mag !

599
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:42,266
Where's your papa?
Where's your papa?

600
00:40:42,349 --> 00:40:43,476
Papa !

601
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:46,353
Sir, we need . . . I need a telephone.

602
00:40:46,437 --> 00:40:48,814
-Telephone, telephone, yes !
-Telephone !

603
00:40:48,898 --> 00:40:50,524
Hey, I need a mag ! Give me a mag !

604

Sir, the attitude is not going to speed
things up any bit at all .

610
00:41:07,666 --> 00:41:10,377
I'm going to ask you to speak
into the mouthpiece very clearly.

-Epps ! Where's your wallet?
-Pocket!

-Which pocket?
-My back pocket!

616
00:41:28,354 --> 00:41:32,566
-You got 1 0 back pockets !
-Left cheek! Left cheek! Left cheek!

All right, keep shooting ! Keep shooting !

No, I don't want a premium package !

Sir, we're tracking a Special Ops team
under fire in Qatar.

-No way.
-Yeah .

698
00:47:06,442 --> 00:47:10,863
Looks like there's a message embedded
in the signal . Let me work my magic.

Okay, there's a monster right there !
It just attacked me !

758
00:51:20,237 --> 00:51:24,700
Here he comes ! All right, get up.
Get up and run ! You have to run ! Okay.

759
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:33,375
Sam , what is that thing?

760
00:51:33,458 --> 00:51:34,876
-You have to get in the car. Get in .
-I don't want to.

761
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:37,045
-Get in the car. Trust me. Trust me !
-Sam .

762
00:51:37,129 --> 00:51:41,550
Get in ! Go, go, go, go, go.

763
00:51:53,145 --> 00:51:54,479
Go, go, go, go !

764
00:51:59,067 --> 00:52:00,902
Oh , God ! We're gonna die !
We're gonna die !

765
00:52:00,986 --> 00:52:02,571
No, we're not. No, we're not gonna die.

766
00:52:02,654 --> 00:52:04,990
-Oh , my God !
-Trust me. He's a kick-ass driver!

767
00:52:05,574 --> 00:52:06,992
Oh , my God ! No !

768
00:52:07,075 --> 00:52:08,410
We're gonna die !

769
00:52:14,416 --> 00:52:15,834
Oh , my God !

770
00:52:33,185 --> 00:52:34,352
We're locked in .

771
00:52:36,855 --> 00:52:40,317
The car won't start.
At least we ditched the monster, right?

772
00:52:46,198 --> 00:52:47,324
Okay.

773
00:52:48,867 --> 00:52:50,368
Time to start.

774
00:53:54,683 --> 00:53:56,017
He's got me ! Oh , God !

775
00:54:02,524 --> 00:54:04,442
He's going to kill me !

776
00:54:07,529 --> 00:54:09,239
No. No, no, no !

777
00:54:23,795 --> 00:54:24,963
Get off!

778
00:54:39,644 --> 00:54:40,645
Kill it! Kill it!

779
00:54:40,770 --> 00:54:42,314
Get it, get it, get it, get it!

780
00:54:49,154 --> 00:54:51,156
Not so tough without a head , are you?

781
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:58,580
Here, come on .

782
00:55:13,345 --> 00:55:14,846
What is it?

783
00:55:16,222 --> 00:55:17,682
It's a robot.

784
00:55:19,059 --> 00:55:20,393
But like a...

785
00:55:20,518 --> 00:55:24,022
Like a different. . .
You know, like a super-advanced robot.

786
00:55:25,357 --> 00:55:26,816
It's probably Japanese.

787
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:29,361
Yeah , it's definitely Japanese.

788
00:55:30,904 --> 00:55:32,697
What are you doing?

789
00:55:33,239 --> 00:55:36,451
I don't think it wants to hurt us.
It would have done that already.

790
00:55:36,534 --> 00:55:38,828
Really? Well , do you speak robot?

791
00:55:38,912 --> 00:55:42,374
Because they just had , like,
a giant droid death match .

792
00:55:43,708 --> 00:55:46,878
-I think it wants something from me.
-What?

793
00:55:47,003 --> 00:55:49,547
Well , 'cause the other one was
talking about my eBay page.

794
00:55:50,382 --> 00:55:53,176
You are the strangest boy
I have ever met.

795
00:55:53,593 --> 00:55:55,804
-Can you talk?
<i>-XM Satellite Radio...</i>

796
00:55:55,887 --> 00:55:59,474
<i>Digital cable brings you. . .
. . . Columbia Broadcasting System...</i>

797
00:55:59,557 --> 00:56:01,351
So you . . . You talk through the radio?

798
00:56:01,434 --> 00:56:04,354
<i>Thank you, you're beautiful.
You're wonderful, you're wonderful.</i>

799
00:56:04,437 --> 00:56:06,439
So, what was that last night?
What was that?

800
00:56:06,564 --> 00:56:08,024
<i>Message from Starfleet, Captain...</i>

801
00:56:08,108 --> 00:56:10,193
<i>Throughout the inanimate vastness
of space...</i>

802
00:56:10,276 --> 00:56:12,237
<i>Angels will rain down
like visitors from heaven! Hallelujah!</i>

803
00:56:12,362 --> 00:56:14,489
Visitors from heaven? What...

804
00:56:14,572 --> 00:56:16,741
What are you ,
like, an alien or something?

805
00:56:22,539 --> 00:56:25,083
<i>Anymore questions you want to ask?</i>

806
00:56:25,709 --> 00:56:27,919
He wants us to get in the car.

807
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:30,422
And go where?

808
00:56:31,381 --> 00:56:33,133
Fifty years from now,
when you're looking back at your life,

809
00:56:33,258 --> 00:56:36,386
don't you want to be able to say
you had the guts to get in the car?

810
00:57:05,790 --> 00:57:07,542
This car's a pretty good driver.

811
00:57:07,625 --> 00:57:08,793
I know.

812
00:57:11,463 --> 00:57:13,465
Why don't you go sit in that seat, there?

813
00:57:13,590 --> 00:57:15,759
I'm not going to sit in that seat.
He's driving .

814
00:57:15,842 --> 00:57:16,968
Yeah .

815
00:57:18,303 --> 00:57:19,804
You're right.

816
00:57:21,306 --> 00:57:24,309
-Well , maybe you should sit in my lap.
-Why?

817
00:57:25,477 --> 00:57:29,314
Well , I have the only seat belt here.
You know, safety first.

818
00:57:31,316 --> 00:57:32,734
-Yeah , all right.
-Right?

819
00:57:32,817 --> 00:57:34,444
-Yeah .
-Okay.

820
00:57:36,821 --> 00:57:38,865
There, see? That's better.

821
00:57:39,157 --> 00:57:40,617
-Okay.
-Okay.

822
00:57:44,287 --> 00:57:47,665
You know, that seat belt thing was
a pretty smooth move.

823
00:57:48,666 --> 00:57:49,793
Thank you .

824
00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:52,879
You know what I don't understand?

825
00:57:53,004 --> 00:57:56,049
Why, if he's supposed to be, like,
this super-advanced robot,

826
00:57:56,174 --> 00:57:58,802
does he transform back
into this piece-of-crap Camaro?

827
00:58:00,178 --> 00:58:01,513
Whoa ! Whoa !

828
00:58:01,638 --> 00:58:04,349
Oh , see? No. Get. . .
No, that doesn't work. See?

829
00:58:04,474 --> 00:58:05,517
Move it, you moron !

830
00:58:05,642 --> 00:58:07,685
Great, now. . . See?

831
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:10,188
Fantastic.

832
00:58:10,313 --> 00:58:12,190
Now you pissed him off.

833
00:58:12,482 --> 00:58:13,942
That car is sensitive.

834
00:58:14,025 --> 00:58:16,236
I mean , $4000 just drove off.

835
00:58:29,374 --> 00:58:30,542
What?

836
00:59:34,272 --> 00:59:35,607
This is you ...

837
00:59:40,778 --> 00:59:42,655
Oh , my God !

838
00:59:49,871 --> 00:59:51,623
Come on , let's go.

839
00:59:56,461 --> 00:59:59,714
This is the coolest thing I've ever seen !
Explosions everywhere !

840
00:59:59,797 --> 01:00:03,301
This is easily a hundred times cooler
than <i>Armageddon.</i> I swear to God !

841
01:00:03,384 --> 01:00:05,637
Fire, fire, fire, fire !

842
01:00:19,567 --> 01:00:21,236
Whoa ! Sweet!

843
01:00:21,319 --> 01:00:23,446
Oh , dude, I hope this guy's got
asteroid insurance,

844
01:00:23,529 --> 01:00:24,822
'cause he is so boned !

845
01:00:28,701 --> 01:00:30,078
What is that?

846
01:00:30,578 --> 01:00:32,205
There's something in the tree, dude.

847
01:00:32,330 --> 01:00:34,415
No, there's something
in the thing by the tree !

848
01:00:34,499 --> 01:00:35,875
Could you guys just give me
a space rock?

849
01:01:11,244 --> 01:01:13,788
Excuse me, are you the tooth fairy?

850
01:01:15,039 --> 01:01:18,376
Hey, sweetheart, what are you doing
out here by yourself?

851
01:01:18,459 --> 01:01:20,962
Holy God ! What happened to the pool?

852
01:02:53,471 --> 01:02:57,725
Are you Samuel James Witwicky,
descendent of Archibald Witwicky?

853
01:02:58,851 --> 01:03:00,645
They know your name.

854
01:03:01,479 --> 01:03:02,563
Yeah .

855
01:03:02,647 --> 01:03:05,066
My name is Optimus Prime.

856
01:03:05,149 --> 01:03:09,237
We are autonomous robotic organisms
from the planet Cybertron .

857
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:12,740
-But you can call us Autobots for short.
-Autobots.

858
01:03:12,907 --> 01:03:18,204
-What's cracking , little bitches?
-My first lieutenant. Designation , Jazz.

859
01:03:18,329 --> 01:03:21,833
This looks like a cool place to kick it.

860
01:03:22,375 --> 01:03:24,252
What is that?
How did he learn to talk like that?

861
01:03:24,335 --> 01:03:28,005
We've learned Earth's languages
through the World Wide Web.

862
01:03:29,424 --> 01:03:31,926
My weapons specialist, Ironhide.

863
01:03:32,844 --> 01:03:36,431
-You feeling lucky, punk?
-Easy, Ironhide.

864
01:03:36,514 --> 01:03:39,767
J ust kidding .
I just wanted to show him my cannons.

865
01:03:40,935 --> 01:03:43,146
Our medical officer, Ratchet.

866
01:03:43,229 --> 01:03:47,400
The boy's pheromone level suggests
he wants to mate with the female.

867
01:03:49,777 --> 01:03:53,114
You already know
your guardian , Bumblebee.

868
01:03:53,364 --> 01:03:55,032
Bumblebee, right?

869
01:03:55,116 --> 01:03:56,826
<i>Check on the rep
Yep, second to none</i>

870
01:03:56,909 --> 01:03:59,287
So you're my guardian , huh?

871
01:03:59,370 --> 01:04:04,625
H is vocal processors were damaged
in battle. I'm still working on them .

872
01:04:09,422 --> 01:04:10,798
Why are you here?

873
01:04:10,882 --> 01:04:16,137
We are here looking for the All Spark.
And we must find it before Megatron .

874
01:04:16,429 --> 01:04:17,930
Mega-what?

875
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:33,112
<i>Our planet was once a powerful empire,
peaceful andjust,</i>

876
01:04:34,113 --> 01:04:38,993
<i>until we were betrayed by Megatron,
leader of the Decepticons.</i>

877
01:04:40,077 --> 01:04:43,372
<i>All who defied them were destroyed.</i>

878
01:04:43,456 --> 01:04:49,587
<i>Our war finally consumed the planet,
and the All Spark was lost to the stars.</i>

879
01:04:50,505 --> 01:04:56,594
<i>Megatron followed it to Earth,
where Captain Witwicky found him.</i>

880
01:04:57,678 --> 01:04:59,430
My grandfather.

881
01:04:59,514 --> 01:05:03,768
<i>It was an accident
that intertwined our fates.</i>

882
01:05:06,938 --> 01:05:08,481
Come back!

883
01:05:10,983 --> 01:05:13,611
I think the dogs have found something .

884
01:05:14,654 --> 01:05:16,447
The ice is cracking !

885
01:05:25,790 --> 01:05:28,834
Captain ! Grab my rope, Captain !

886
01:05:29,544 --> 01:05:31,629
I'm all right, lads !

887
01:05:32,713 --> 01:05:35,383
Can we throw you a rope, Captain?

888
01:05:42,723 --> 01:05:47,853
<i>Megatron crash-landed
before he could retrieve the Cube.</i>

889
01:05:51,399 --> 01:05:54,902
Men ! We've made a discovery!

890
01:05:54,986 --> 01:05:59,407
<i>He accidentally activated
his navigation system.</i>

891
01:06:13,004 --> 01:06:18,843
<i>The coordinates to the Cube's location
on Earth were imprinted on his glasses.</i>

892
01:06:18,926 --> 01:06:20,970
How'd you know about his glasses?

893
01:06:21,053 --> 01:06:23,306
-EBay.
-eBay.

894
01:06:23,389 --> 01:06:26,559
If the Decepticons find the All Spark,

895
01:06:26,684 --> 01:06:32,523
they will use its power to transform
Earth's machines and build a new army.

896
01:06:32,607 --> 01:06:36,027
And the human race
will be extinguished .

897
01:06:36,110 --> 01:06:41,574
Sam Witwicky,
you hold the key to Earth's survival .

898
01:06:44,744 --> 01:06:47,622
Please tell me
that you have those glasses.

899
01:06:51,709 --> 01:06:55,129
It's like
a self-regenerating molecular armor.

900
01:06:55,212 --> 01:06:57,256
Look at the scorch mark
where the sabot round hit.

901
01:06:57,381 --> 01:06:58,591
Melted right through .

902
01:06:58,716 --> 01:07:01,927
Hey, aren't sabots hot-loaded for, like,
a 6, 000-degree magnesium burn?

903
01:07:02,053 --> 01:07:04,263
Close to it. It melts tank armor.

904
01:07:04,388 --> 01:07:06,557
So this metal skin must react
to extreme heat.

905
01:07:06,891 --> 01:07:08,934
-Heads up !
-Oh !

906
01:07:09,644 --> 01:07:12,396
I thought you said
that thing was dead , man !

907
01:07:12,730 --> 01:07:16,484
Strap it down ! Strap it!
This thing is wicked .

908
01:07:16,567 --> 01:07:17,943
All right, get on the horn
with Northern Command .

909
01:07:18,069 --> 01:07:20,279
Tell them that our effective weapon
is high-heat sabot rounds.

910
01:07:20,404 --> 01:07:22,073
Recommend we load them
on all the gunships. Go.

911
01:07:27,078 --> 01:07:28,788
You want that piece?

912
01:07:28,913 --> 01:07:32,208
Okay, Maggie, look. Let me break
it down to you how it's gonna happen .

913
01:07:32,291 --> 01:07:34,377
They gonna come through that door
and be good cop, bad cop.

914
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:37,797
Don't fall for that, all right?
That's why I ate their food .

915
01:07:37,922 --> 01:07:40,466
See, they put the plate of donuts
out here to test your guilt.

916
01:07:40,591 --> 01:07:43,052
If you don't touch it, you're guilty.

917
01:07:43,135 --> 01:07:46,972
I ate the whole plate.
The whole plate. Okay?

918
01:07:47,098 --> 01:07:48,265
It's me and you .

919
01:07:48,349 --> 01:07:51,185
They walk through that door,
you don't say nothing .

920
01:08:05,199 --> 01:08:08,285
She did it! She did it!
She's the one you want! All right?

921
01:08:08,369 --> 01:08:09,995
I was just sitting at home
watching cartoons,

922
01:08:10,121 --> 01:08:11,997
playing video games with my cousin ,
and she came in there.

923
01:08:12,123 --> 01:08:13,207
-And then . . .
-Glen , you freak.

924
01:08:13,290 --> 01:08:15,501
Hey! I am not going to jail for you
or anybody else !

925
01:08:15,626 --> 01:08:20,214
I have done nothing bad my entire life !
Hey, man , I'm still a virgin .

926
01:08:20,297 --> 01:08:21,382
Okay, so what?

927
01:08:21,465 --> 01:08:23,592
I've downloaded a couple of
thousand songs off the Internet.

928
01:08:23,676 --> 01:08:25,386
Who hasn't? Who hasn't?

929
01:08:25,469 --> 01:08:26,554
-I promise !
-Glen , shut up !

930
01:08:26,637 --> 01:08:30,474
No, you shut up ! Don't talk to me !
Don't talk to me, criminal !

931
01:08:32,643 --> 01:08:34,812
-Oh , sugar rush .
-This is. . . This is not his fault.

932
01:08:34,937 --> 01:08:36,480
See? So can I go home now?

933
01:08:36,605 --> 01:08:38,816
-Oh , okay. I won't.
-But just listen to me.

934
01:08:38,941 --> 01:08:42,653
Okay, whoever hacked into your military
system downloaded a file, all right?

935
01:08:42,778 --> 01:08:45,072
It was something about
someone named Witwicky

936
01:08:45,156 --> 01:08:48,784
and some government group, right?
Named Sector Seven .

937
01:08:48,868 --> 01:08:50,619
You have to let me talk to
Defense Secretary Keller

938
01:08:50,703 --> 01:08:52,997
before you go to war
with the wrong country!

939
01:08:53,122 --> 01:08:55,958
<i>Whatever fell out of the sky
ended up right behind...</i>

940
01:08:56,041 --> 01:08:57,668
-What did he say?
-What?

941
01:08:57,793 --> 01:08:59,211
-Did he hear it, too?
-Yeah , Jack heard it, too. Yeah .

942
01:08:59,336 --> 01:09:01,881
-What does he think it is?
-He thinks it's a military experiment.

943
01:09:02,006 --> 01:09:03,382
-What a knucklehead .
-Yeah , well , I think it's a plane.

944
01:09:08,721 --> 01:09:10,598
<i>Still no official word as to
what happened. You can see...</i>

945
01:09:10,681 --> 01:09:11,891
<i>-Yeah!</i>
-Call Sam .

946
01:09:12,016 --> 01:09:13,559
-Yeah . Why?
-He should be home in 1 5 minutes.

947
01:09:13,684 --> 01:09:14,977
Well , I'll call him in 1 5 minutes.

948
01:09:15,060 --> 01:09:17,605
If you wait 1 5 minutes, he'll be late
and you'll have to ground him .

949
01:09:17,688 --> 01:09:19,356
Well , I can't ground him
if he's not late, can I?

950
01:09:24,570 --> 01:09:26,030
I need you to stay here, all right?

951
01:09:26,155 --> 01:09:27,198
You got to stay here
and you're gonna watch them .

952
01:09:27,323 --> 01:09:28,365
-Okay, okay.
-All of them .

953
01:09:28,491 --> 01:09:29,492
-Do you hear what I'm saying?
-Yeah , okay, okay.

954
01:09:29,575 --> 01:09:30,701
Five minutes, all right?

955
01:09:31,202 --> 01:09:34,205
-Thanks for staying on my path .
-Oh , yeah . No, no, Dad . Hey!

956
01:09:34,330 --> 01:09:36,290
The. . . Oh , the path . I'm sorry.
I forgot about the path .

957
01:09:36,373 --> 01:09:38,042
I'm gonna sweep the whole thing
right now. How about that?

958
01:09:38,167 --> 01:09:40,419
-You know, I buy half your car. . .
-Yeah .

959
01:09:40,544 --> 01:09:44,215
...then I bail you out of jail and then
I just decided to do all your chores.

960
01:09:44,340 --> 01:09:45,883
-The chores.
-Yeah . Life is great, huh?

961
01:09:46,008 --> 01:09:48,844
Life. . . Life is fantastic, is how good it is.

962
01:09:48,928 --> 01:09:51,514
It's so. . . Oh , the trash cans. Sorry, Dad .
I'm gonna do the trash cans now.

963
01:09:51,597 --> 01:09:52,723
No, no, I don't want you
to strain yourself.

964
01:09:52,848 --> 01:09:54,266
No, no, I won't strain myself, Dad .

965
01:09:54,391 --> 01:09:55,851
-I'll do it.
-It would hurt my feelings if you do it.

966
01:09:55,935 --> 01:09:57,311
-You sure? I don't mind , I don't. . .
-I promise...

967
01:09:57,394 --> 01:09:58,646
No, no, no, I'm gonna do it.

968
01:09:58,729 --> 01:10:00,648
I'm gonna do the trash cans
and I'm gonna scrape the grill

969
01:10:00,731 --> 01:10:04,610
and I'm gonna. . . I'm gonna sweep up
the whole house right now.

970
01:10:04,735 --> 01:10:07,071
-Tonight, right now?
-Right now.

971
01:10:07,196 --> 01:10:08,239
The...

972
01:10:10,074 --> 01:10:12,576
I love you . God , I love you

973
01:10:12,701 --> 01:10:14,411
just so much right now.

974
01:10:14,537 --> 01:10:15,955
You know,
Mom wanted me to ground you .

975
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:17,581
-You're three minutes late.
-Right?

976
01:10:17,706 --> 01:10:19,542
Oh , well , just another thing
you did for me, Dad ,

977
01:10:19,625 --> 01:10:21,001
because you're such a swell guy.

978
01:10:21,085 --> 01:10:22,253
One more thing , huh?

979
01:10:22,378 --> 01:10:25,422
All right, I love you !
Sleep good , handsome man !

980
01:10:26,423 --> 01:10:27,591
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

981
01:10:27,758 --> 01:10:31,011
No, watch the path ! Watch the path !
Watch the. . . Please, please, please.

982
01:10:31,095 --> 01:10:33,973
No, no, wait. No, no, no ! Oh , no !

983
01:10:34,098 --> 01:10:36,517
-Sorry. My bad .
-Oh , I . . . You couldn't...

984
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:38,602
You couldn't wait for five. . .
You couldn't wait for five minutes?

985
01:10:38,727 --> 01:10:41,564
I told you to just stay! J ust stay! God !

986
01:10:44,775 --> 01:10:46,777
-I told you to watch them . I told you .
-Okay, you know what?

987
01:10:46,902 --> 01:10:50,948
-They seem to be in a little bit of a rush .
-Oh , this is bad . No !

988
01:10:52,157 --> 01:10:54,618
Mojo, Mojo ! Off the robot! God !

989
01:10:55,119 --> 01:10:57,705
-Oh , wet.
-No, no, no, no, no ! Easy! Easy!

990
01:10:57,788 --> 01:11:00,583
Hold on ! Hold ! This is Mojo.
This is Mojo. He's a pet of mine.

991
01:11:00,666 --> 01:11:03,460
He's a pet. Okay? That's all .
If you could just put the guns away...

992
01:11:03,586 --> 01:11:06,547
-Put the. . . Put them away. Please.
-You have a rodent infestation .

993
01:11:06,630 --> 01:11:07,840
-A what?
-Shall I terminate?

994
01:11:07,965 --> 01:11:10,134
No, no, no, no.
He's not a rodent, he's a Chihuahua.

995
01:11:10,259 --> 01:11:13,429
This is my. . . This is my Chihuahua.
We love Chihuahuas ! Don't we?

996
01:11:13,512 --> 01:11:16,265
He's leaked lubricants all over my foot.

997
01:11:17,683 --> 01:11:21,896
-He peed on you? Bad Mojo. Bad Mojo !
-Bad Mojo !

998
01:11:21,979 --> 01:11:23,480
I'm sorry.
He's got a male dominance thing .

999
01:11:23,606 --> 01:11:25,149
That's all it is.

1000
01:11:25,274 --> 01:11:28,110
-My foot's gonna rust.
-All right.

1001
01:11:29,111 --> 01:11:30,487
Okay, okay.

1002
01:11:31,655 --> 01:11:34,325
-Shut up and go hide !
-J ust hurry.

1003
01:11:37,494 --> 01:11:39,121
Autobots, recon .

1004
01:11:40,998 --> 01:11:43,626
I hope he's okay. He's in the kitchen .

1005
01:11:43,709 --> 01:11:45,461
Got some ice on his nose.

1006
01:11:45,544 --> 01:11:48,005
I had to slap him around a little bit.

1007
01:11:48,130 --> 01:11:49,506
You did not.

1008
01:11:50,716 --> 01:11:52,760
-You didn't even ground him .
-Almost, almost.

1009
01:11:53,636 --> 01:11:56,180
Where are they? No, no, no, no, no.

1010
01:11:58,223 --> 01:11:59,892
Come on , come on .

1011
01:12:04,688 --> 01:12:07,816
-What? What is this?
-Time is short.

1012
01:12:07,900 --> 01:12:10,486
-They really want those glasses.
-Come on . What are you doing?

1013
01:12:10,569 --> 01:12:12,279
-I'm gonna help you .
-Okay.

1014
01:12:12,363 --> 01:12:14,365
-Please hurry.
-Okay.

1015
01:12:15,699 --> 01:12:17,743
-Yeah , no, no. It's definitely gone.
-What do you mean?

1016
01:12:17,868 --> 01:12:18,869
My glasses were in the bag .

1017
01:12:18,994 --> 01:12:20,829
They were in the backpack
and now the backpack isn't here.

1018
01:12:20,913 --> 01:12:22,498
Well , they're gonna be pissed ,
so what do you wanna do?

1019
01:12:22,581 --> 01:12:23,666
So what I think you should do is
you should ...

1020
01:12:23,749 --> 01:12:25,960
You should check this whole. . .
This whole section here.

1021
01:12:26,043 --> 01:12:29,004
J ust give it a clean sweep,
and I'll get the corner here.

1022
01:12:29,088 --> 01:12:31,507
Yeah , no, no, no. Not there.
That's my. . . That's my private...

1023
01:12:31,590 --> 01:12:32,925
-Sorry. That's nothing .
-You just...

1024
01:12:33,050 --> 01:12:34,134
-You just told me to look. . .
-I know,

1025
01:12:34,218 --> 01:12:35,594
but I didn't mean to look inside
of my treasure chest.

1026
01:12:35,719 --> 01:12:38,389
You should be way more specific
so I don't get in trouble in your room .

1027
01:12:38,514 --> 01:12:40,432
I'm already stressed out enough .

1028
01:12:40,557 --> 01:12:42,059
Okay. What now?

1029
01:12:44,395 --> 01:12:47,856
No. No, no. No, no, no.

1030
01:12:47,940 --> 01:12:51,777
This isn't hiding . This isn't hiding .
This is my backyard , not a truck stop.

1031
01:12:51,902 --> 01:12:53,028
Oh , God . Oh !

1032
01:12:53,112 --> 01:12:57,282
<i>Okay, I saw it. The UFO landed
right here and now it's gone.</i>

1033
01:12:57,408 --> 01:12:59,743
<i>My moped's under there, man!
Who's gonna pay for that?</i>

1034
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:02,871
Sam? Sam , Sam , Sam , Sam .

1035
01:13:02,955 --> 01:13:05,916
-He's back here.
-I can't deal with this. I can't...

1036
01:13:06,041 --> 01:13:07,626
What? Oh , no, no, no.

1037
01:13:07,751 --> 01:13:08,794
-This is my mother's flower. . .
-Oops.

1038
01:13:08,919 --> 01:13:10,129
Okay, listen . You got to listen to me.

1039
01:13:10,254 --> 01:13:12,214
If my parents come out here
and see you , they're gonna freak out.

1040
01:13:12,297 --> 01:13:13,799
My mother's got a temper, okay?

1041
01:13:13,924 --> 01:13:15,467
We must have the glasses.

1042
01:13:15,592 --> 01:13:17,136
I know you need the glasses.
I've been looking everywhere.

1043
01:13:17,261 --> 01:13:19,471
They're not here.
They're definitely not here.

1044
01:13:19,596 --> 01:13:20,681
Keep searching .

1045
01:13:20,764 --> 01:13:22,433
I need you to be quiet for five minutes.

1046
01:13:22,558 --> 01:13:23,767
Ten minutes. Okay?

1047
01:13:23,892 --> 01:13:25,644
Please, I'm begging you . You got to. . .
You're making a racket.

1048
01:13:25,769 --> 01:13:27,730
I can't concentrate.
You want me to look and I'm hearing ...

1049
01:13:27,813 --> 01:13:28,897
Calm down , calm down .

1050
01:13:28,981 --> 01:13:30,691
You got to do something here.
You got to do something here.

1051
01:13:30,774 --> 01:13:33,444
-Autobots, fall back.
-Thank you . Please, for five minutes.

1052
01:13:33,569 --> 01:13:35,320
Good? Good? Okay.

1053
01:13:35,446 --> 01:13:36,697
-Move !
-Get away!

1054
01:13:36,780 --> 01:13:38,490
What's the matter with you?
Can't you be quiet?

1055
01:13:38,615 --> 01:13:40,492
He wants us to be quiet.

1056
01:13:44,288 --> 01:13:48,125
Earthquake ! Move, move, move, move,
move ! Earthquake !

1057
01:13:48,250 --> 01:13:52,087
J udy! J udy, get under the table ! Move it!
Duck and cover right now!

1058
01:13:52,171 --> 01:13:54,089
How did you get over there so fast?

1059
01:13:55,132 --> 01:13:56,925
Wow! That was tingly!

1060
01:13:57,468 --> 01:14:00,429
-You got to try that!
-Yeah , that looks fun .

1061
01:14:05,267 --> 01:14:07,311
-Sam?
-Sammy?

1062
01:14:09,646 --> 01:14:12,357
-What the hell is that?
-I don't know.

1063
01:14:13,150 --> 01:14:14,943
-Sam?
-That's weird .

1064
01:14:15,027 --> 01:14:16,779
-Sam !
-Ratchet, point the light.

1065
01:14:16,862 --> 01:14:19,448
-Come on , hurry.
-Listen , we got a major issue in here.

1066
01:14:19,531 --> 01:14:20,616
What's with the light?
You gotta stop the light.

1067
01:14:20,699 --> 01:14:22,618
What's going on? Turn it off.
You gotta tell him to shut it off.

1068
01:14:22,701 --> 01:14:23,869
-Shut it off.
-Sam , are you in there?

1069
01:14:23,994 --> 01:14:25,037
How come the door's locked?

1070
01:14:25,162 --> 01:14:28,791
You know the rules.
No doors locked in my house !

1071
01:14:28,874 --> 01:14:30,084
You know he'll start counting

1072
01:14:30,167 --> 01:14:31,460
-if you don't open the door!
-One more chance. Five...

1073
01:14:31,543 --> 01:14:32,669
Oh , dear.

1074
01:14:32,795 --> 01:14:34,505
-Four. It's coming off the hinges, pal .
-He's counting !

1075
01:14:34,671 --> 01:14:35,923
-Sam , just open the door.
-Three.

1076
01:14:36,006 --> 01:14:37,091
-Oh , my.
-Two.

1077
01:14:37,174 --> 01:14:39,301
-He's counting .
-Stand back.

1078
01:14:39,718 --> 01:14:43,430
-What's up? What's with the bat?
-Who were you talking to?

1079
01:14:43,514 --> 01:14:46,517
-I'm talking to you .
-Why are you so sweaty and filthy?

1080
01:14:46,642 --> 01:14:48,227
I'm a child . You know, I'm a teenager.

1081
01:14:48,352 --> 01:14:50,562
We heard voices and noises
and we thought maybe you were...

1082
01:14:50,687 --> 01:14:52,523
It doesn't matter what we thought.
What was that light?

1083
01:14:52,648 --> 01:14:54,441
No, what light? What?
There's no light, Dad ! There's no light!

1084
01:14:54,525 --> 01:14:56,026
You got two lights in your hand !
That's what it is.

1085
01:14:56,151 --> 01:14:57,402
-Maybe it bounced . . .
-There was light under the door.

1086
01:14:57,528 --> 01:14:59,530
Look, you can't. . . You can't just bounce
into my room like that.

1087
01:14:59,655 --> 01:15:01,031
You got to knock.
You got to communicate.

1088
01:15:01,156 --> 01:15:02,157
-We knocked for five minutes.
-I'm a teenager.

1089
01:15:02,241 --> 01:15:03,617
-We knocked .
-You didn't knock.

1090
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:05,160
-You were screaming at me, okay?
-No.

1091
01:15:05,244 --> 01:15:06,703
This is repression ,
what you're doing here.

1092
01:15:06,829 --> 01:15:09,164
-You're ruining my youth , okay?
-Oh , for Pete's sakes !

1093
01:15:09,248 --> 01:15:13,752
You are so defensive !
Were you masturbating?

1094
01:15:15,504 --> 01:15:16,588
-J udy.
-Was I ...

1095
01:15:16,713 --> 01:15:17,756
-No, Mom .
-Zip it, okay?

1096
01:15:17,881 --> 01:15:19,174
-It's okay.
-No, I don't masturbate !

1097
01:15:19,258 --> 01:15:20,342
That's not something for you
to bring up.

1098
01:15:20,425 --> 01:15:21,969
-That's a father-and-son thing , okay?
-Father-son thing .

1099
01:15:22,052 --> 01:15:24,888
I mean , you don't have to call it that
word if that makes you uncomfortable.

1100
01:15:25,013 --> 01:15:28,642
You can call it Sam's happy time or...

1101
01:15:28,725 --> 01:15:30,561
-Happy time?
-. . . my special alone time...

1102
01:15:30,686 --> 01:15:31,728
-Stop.
-Mom .

1103
01:15:31,854 --> 01:15:32,896
-J udy, stop.
-. . .with myself.

1104
01:15:33,021 --> 01:15:34,022
-Mom , you can't come in and . . .
-I'm sorry.

1105
01:15:34,106 --> 01:15:36,441
It's just been a weird night.
I've had a little bit to drink.

1106
01:15:36,567 --> 01:15:38,569
-No, no, Dad .
-Yeah , well , we saw a light.

1107
01:15:38,694 --> 01:15:40,445
Oh , parents.

1108
01:15:41,363 --> 01:15:44,199
I don't know where it was, but we saw it.

1109
01:15:45,242 --> 01:15:48,829
Earthquake ! It's another one ! Another
earthquake ! Get in the doorway!

1110
01:15:48,912 --> 01:15:51,456
-Okay!
-Aftershock! Aftershock!

1111
01:15:51,582 --> 01:15:52,666
Oh , I hate these.

1112
01:15:52,749 --> 01:15:54,042
-Got to ride it out. Ride it out!
-Quick, hide.

1113
01:15:54,126 --> 01:15:55,169
-Hey, the lights are back on .
-H ide? What?

1114
01:15:55,252 --> 01:15:56,837
-Where?
-Come on , get out of that tub.

1115
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:58,255
Can't you take safety seriously?

1116
01:15:58,380 --> 01:16:01,633
-Good Lord , this floor is filthy, Sam .
-Oh , oh , man ! Man . Oh .

1117
01:16:01,758 --> 01:16:04,636
Oh , no ! Look at the yard .
The yard is destroyed .

1118
01:16:09,725 --> 01:16:13,228
J udy? Better call the city.
We got a blown transformer!

1119
01:16:13,312 --> 01:16:15,856
Power pole's sparking all over
the place !

1120
01:16:15,939 --> 01:16:18,192
Oh , man . Yard's a waste.

1121
01:16:18,275 --> 01:16:19,985
Trashed . Gone.

1122
01:16:20,277 --> 01:16:21,737
-It's a wash . The whole yard .
-You're kidding .

1123
01:16:21,820 --> 01:16:23,864
The parents are very irritating .

1124
01:16:23,947 --> 01:16:25,699
-Yeah , yeah , yeah .
-Can I take them out?

1125
01:16:25,782 --> 01:16:28,535
Ironhide, you know
we don't harm humans.

1126
01:16:28,619 --> 01:16:29,828
What is with you?

1127
01:16:29,953 --> 01:16:33,248
Well , I'm just saying we could .
It's an option .

1128
01:16:33,332 --> 01:16:35,042
We heard you talking
to somebody, Sam .

1129
01:16:35,125 --> 01:16:37,544
-We wanna know who.
-Mom , I told ...

1130
01:16:37,628 --> 01:16:39,463
H i . I'm Mikaela.

1131
01:16:40,172 --> 01:16:42,466
I'm a. . . I'm a friend of Sam's.

1132
01:16:43,926 --> 01:16:46,678
Gosh , you're gorgeous.
Isn't that the prettiest girl?

1133
01:16:46,803 --> 01:16:49,640
-She can hear you talking , Mom .
-Thank you .

1134
01:16:49,765 --> 01:16:52,809
Oh , my goodness. I'm sorry you had to
hear our little family discussion about...

1135
01:16:52,935 --> 01:16:54,394
-Sorry that we're bugging you .
-Do you have my backpack?

1136
01:16:54,478 --> 01:16:55,562
-Come on , hon . Let's go.
-Oh , it's in the kitchen .

1137
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:16,416
Oh , yes. Okay. Okay.

1138
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:18,335
-Yeah .
-Your mom's so nice.

1139
01:17:18,460 --> 01:17:19,586
I want you to distract my parents

1140
01:17:19,670 --> 01:17:22,005
while I slip out and get these glasses
to them , okay?

1141
01:17:27,928 --> 01:17:30,514
-Ronald Wickity?
-It's Witwicky. Who are you?

1142
01:17:30,597 --> 01:17:32,599
We're the government. Sector Seven .

1143
01:17:32,683 --> 01:17:34,851
-Never heard of it.
-Never will .

1144
01:17:34,977 --> 01:17:37,521
Your son's the great-grandson
of Captain Archibald Wickity, is he not?

1145
01:17:37,604 --> 01:17:38,772
It's Witwicky.

1146
01:17:38,855 --> 01:17:42,109
May I enter the premises, sir?

1147
01:17:42,192 --> 01:17:44,945
Ron , there's guys all over the front yard .

1148
01:17:45,028 --> 01:17:46,196
What the heck is going on here?

1149
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:48,448
Your son filed a stolen car report
last night.

1150
01:17:48,532 --> 01:17:50,784
We think it's involved in
a national security matter.

1151
01:17:50,867 --> 01:17:52,286
-They're ripping up my rose bushes !
-National security?

1152
01:17:52,369 --> 01:17:53,453
That's right. National security.

1153
01:17:53,537 --> 01:17:55,205
My God , Ron , they're everywhere.

1154
01:17:55,289 --> 01:17:57,624
There's guys in suits all around
the house ! Look at this !

1155
01:17:57,708 --> 01:17:59,543
Could you stay off the grass?

1156
01:17:59,668 --> 01:18:01,128
Get me a sample
and some isotope readings.

1157
01:18:01,211 --> 01:18:02,796
They're pulling bushes out
of the ground !

1158
01:18:02,879 --> 01:18:06,133
Good Lord ! They've got to get
their hands off my bush !

1159
01:18:06,216 --> 01:18:07,718
-Drop the bat, ma'am .
-Hey, hey, hey, that's my...

1160
01:18:07,843 --> 01:18:09,136
I'm carrying a loaded weapon .

1161
01:18:09,219 --> 01:18:10,637
But you'd better get those guys
out of my garden

1162
01:18:10,721 --> 01:18:12,889
or I am gonna beat the crap out of them !

1163
01:18:12,973 --> 01:18:15,976
Are you experiencing any flu-like
symptoms? Aching joints? Fever?

1164
01:18:16,059 --> 01:18:18,145
-No !
-What is this?

1165
01:18:18,228 --> 01:18:20,981
How you doing , son?
Is your name Sam?

1166
01:18:21,064 --> 01:18:22,566
-Yeah .
-Well , I need you to come with us.

1167
01:18:22,691 --> 01:18:23,900
Whoa, way out of line.

1168
01:18:24,026 --> 01:18:28,071
Sir, I am asking politely. Back off.

1169
01:18:28,155 --> 01:18:30,073
-You're not taking my son .
-Really?

1170
01:18:30,157 --> 01:18:31,241
You gonna try to get rough with us?

1171
01:18:31,325 --> 01:18:32,492
No, but I'm gonna call the cops

1172
01:18:32,576 --> 01:18:34,828
because there's something fishy
going on around here.

1173
01:18:34,911 --> 01:18:37,664
Yeah . There's something a little fishy
about you , your son ,

1174
01:18:37,748 --> 01:18:41,668
your little Taco Bell dog and this
whole operation you got going on here.

1175
01:18:41,752 --> 01:18:44,004
-What operation?
-That is what we are gonna find out.

1176
01:18:44,087 --> 01:18:46,715
I think direct contact.

1177
01:18:52,095 --> 01:18:53,722
-Son?
-Yeah .

1178
01:18:54,723 --> 01:18:57,684
-Step forward , please.
-J ust stand?

1179
01:19:03,398 --> 01:19:04,900
Fourteen rads.

1180
01:19:06,443 --> 01:19:07,944
Bingo ! Tag them and bag them !

1181
01:19:08,695 --> 01:19:10,614
If you hurt my dog , I'll kick your ass !

1182
01:19:10,697 --> 01:19:12,366
Get me a sample on
that vegetation ASAP !

1183
01:19:12,449 --> 01:19:14,034
Sam ! Do not say anything , Sam !

1184
01:19:14,117 --> 01:19:16,036
-Yeah .
-Not a word until we get a lawyer!

1185
01:19:20,248 --> 01:19:21,458
So,

1186
01:19:22,876 --> 01:19:26,380
LadiesMan21 7.

1187
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:29,883
That is your eBay username, right?

1188
01:19:29,966 --> 01:19:32,302
Yeah , but, you know,
it was a typo and I ran with it.

1189
01:19:32,427 --> 01:19:33,470
What do you make of this?

1190
01:19:33,595 --> 01:19:36,056
<i>My name is Sam Witwicky, okay?
And my...</i>

1191
01:19:36,139 --> 01:19:37,307
Is that you?

1192
01:19:37,391 --> 01:19:39,559
Yeah , that sounds like LadiesMan .

1193
01:19:39,643 --> 01:19:44,564
Last night at the station , you told
the officer your car transformed .

1194
01:19:45,816 --> 01:19:48,235
-Enlighten me.
-Well , here's what I said , okay?

1195
01:19:48,318 --> 01:19:52,739
'Cause this is a total misunderstanding
that my car had been stolen ...

1196
01:19:52,823 --> 01:19:54,991
-Really?
-. . .from me, from my home,

1197
01:19:55,117 --> 01:19:58,078
but it's fine now because it's back!
It came back!

1198
01:19:58,161 --> 01:19:59,913
-Well , not by itself.
-Well , no.

1199
01:19:59,996 --> 01:20:03,458
Because cars don't do that
because that would be crazy.

1200
01:20:06,586 --> 01:20:08,171
That's funny. That is so funny.

1201
01:20:08,296 --> 01:20:10,799
So what do you kids know
about aliens, huh?

1202
01:20:11,967 --> 01:20:14,761
Oh , you mean , like a Martian?
Like what, E. T. ? No.

1203
01:20:14,845 --> 01:20:16,346
-It's an urban legend .
-Yeah .

1204
01:20:16,430 --> 01:20:17,597
You see this?

1205
01:20:17,681 --> 01:20:20,267
This is an I-can-do-whatever-I-want
and-get-away-with-it badge.

1206
01:20:20,350 --> 01:20:23,103
-Right.
-I'm gonna lock you up forever.

1207
01:20:23,186 --> 01:20:24,438
Oh , God . You know what?
Don't listen to him .

1208
01:20:24,521 --> 01:20:26,940
He's just pissy 'cause he's got to
get back to guarding the mall .

1209
01:20:27,023 --> 01:20:30,110
You , in the training bra, do not test me.

1210
01:20:30,193 --> 01:20:32,362
Especially with your daddy's parole
coming up.

1211
01:20:32,446 --> 01:20:33,864
What? Parole?

1212
01:20:33,947 --> 01:20:37,284
-It's nothing .
-Oh , grand theft auto, that ain't nothing?

1213
01:20:37,367 --> 01:20:39,369
You know those cars my dad
used to teach me to fix?

1214
01:20:39,494 --> 01:20:41,204
Well , they. . . They weren't always his.

1215
01:20:41,329 --> 01:20:42,456
You stole cars?

1216
01:20:42,539 --> 01:20:44,207
Well , we couldn't always afford
a babysitter,

1217
01:20:44,332 --> 01:20:46,126
so sometimes he had to take me along .

1218
01:20:46,209 --> 01:20:48,545
She's got her own juvie record
to prove it!

1219
01:20:48,628 --> 01:20:51,298
She's a criminal . Criminals are hot.

1220
01:20:52,382 --> 01:20:57,053
That'd be a real shame if he had to rot
in jail the rest of his natural life.

1221
01:20:57,137 --> 01:20:59,473
It is time to talk!

1222
01:21:06,188 --> 01:21:07,647
Big ! It's big !

1223
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:14,362
Go, go, go, go !

1224
01:21:14,738 --> 01:21:17,407
-I can't see it! I can't see it!
-Shift your weight towards the front!

1225
01:21:17,491 --> 01:21:18,909
All right! All right!

1226
01:21:33,507 --> 01:21:35,842
You A-holes are in trouble now.

1227
01:21:35,926 --> 01:21:42,432
Gentlemen , I want to introduce you
to my friend , Optimus Prime.

1228
01:21:44,684 --> 01:21:48,438
Taking the children was a bad move.

1229
01:21:48,563 --> 01:21:51,942
Autobots, relieve them of their weapons.

1230
01:21:55,570 --> 01:21:57,280
Freeze !

1231
01:21:57,906 --> 01:21:59,366
-Whoa ! Whoa !
-Give me those !

1232
01:21:59,449 --> 01:22:00,534
Whoa !

1233
01:22:01,910 --> 01:22:03,036
Whoa !

1234
01:22:13,755 --> 01:22:15,131
H i , there.

1235
01:22:15,423 --> 01:22:20,136
You don't seem afraid .
Are you not surprised to see us?

1236
01:22:20,804 --> 01:22:25,809
Look, there are
S-Seven protocols, okay?

1237
01:22:26,393 --> 01:22:27,727
I'm not authorized
to communicate with you

1238
01:22:27,811 --> 01:22:30,063
except to tell you
I can't communicate with you .

1239
01:22:30,146 --> 01:22:32,774
-Get out of the car.
-All right.

1240
01:22:33,316 --> 01:22:34,484
-Me? You want me to get. . .
-Now!

1241
01:22:34,609 --> 01:22:36,069
All right, all right. Get out. Hey.

1242
01:22:36,152 --> 01:22:39,573
All right, I'm . . . I'm getting out.
I'm getting out. You see?

1243
01:22:39,656 --> 01:22:43,159
Very nifty how you put us down
without really killing us.

1244
01:22:43,285 --> 01:22:44,828
You're good with handcuffs, too,
now, huh?

1245
01:22:44,911 --> 01:22:45,912
How you doing?

1246
01:22:45,996 --> 01:22:47,747
-You weren't supposed to hear all that.
-How's it going , huh?

1247
01:22:47,831 --> 01:22:50,000
-Yeah .
-This is real .

1248
01:22:50,125 --> 01:22:53,253
Now, listen . If I choose to engage
with him , mum is the word , all right?

1249
01:22:53,336 --> 01:22:57,173
Sam , I have a record
because I wouldn't turn my dad in .

1250
01:22:57,757 --> 01:23:01,970
When have you had to sacrifice
anything in your perfect little life?

1251
01:23:03,471 --> 01:23:05,181
Big guys. Big guys with big guns, huh?

1252
01:23:05,265 --> 01:23:08,101
What is Sector Seven? Answer me.

1253
01:23:08,184 --> 01:23:10,770
I'm the one who asks questions
around here. Not you , young man !

1254
01:23:10,854 --> 01:23:13,106
-How'd you know about the aliens?
-Where did you take my parents?

1255
01:23:13,189 --> 01:23:15,191
-I am not at liberty to discuss it.
-No?

1256
01:23:15,275 --> 01:23:17,110
Hey. You touch me,
that's a federal offense.

1257
01:23:17,193 --> 01:23:18,945
Do-whatever-you-want
and-get-away-with-it badge, right?

1258
01:23:19,029 --> 01:23:21,948
Yeah . Brave now all of a sudden , with
his big alien friend standing over there.

1259
01:23:22,032 --> 01:23:25,201
-Where is Sector Seven?
-Wouldn't you like to know?

1260
01:23:30,373 --> 01:23:31,458
Hey!

1261
01:23:31,541 --> 01:23:34,461
Bumblebee, stop lubricating the man .

1262
01:23:34,544 --> 01:23:36,546
Get that thing to stop, huh?

1263
01:23:38,006 --> 01:23:41,301
-All right, tough guy, take it off.
-What are you talking about?

1264
01:23:41,384 --> 01:23:44,137
-Your clothes, all of it, off.
-For what?

1265
01:23:45,347 --> 01:23:47,182
For threatening my dad .

1266
01:23:50,226 --> 01:23:56,191
Little lady, this is the beginning
of the end of your life.

1267
01:23:57,901 --> 01:23:59,569
You're a criminal .

1268
01:24:00,236 --> 01:24:03,073
Let's face facts. It's in your gene pool .

1269
01:24:04,532 --> 01:24:07,327
Those are nice.
Now get behind the pole.

1270
01:24:07,410 --> 01:24:08,495
All right.

1271
01:24:08,578 --> 01:24:10,705
This is such a felony, what you're doing .

1272
01:24:12,707 --> 01:24:14,584
-I will hunt you down , okay?
-He'll hunt you down .

1273
01:24:14,709 --> 01:24:16,920
-Without any remorse !
-No remorse.

1274
01:24:17,003 --> 01:24:18,254
-Enjoy.
-Okay?

1275
01:24:18,380 --> 01:24:22,842
-We have got to alert everyone.
-They already know. Speaker.

1276
01:24:29,349 --> 01:24:31,267
Optimus ! Incoming !

1277
01:24:38,942 --> 01:24:40,235
Roll out.

1278
01:24:47,117 --> 01:24:50,453
<i>Okay, I'm picking up rad readings
under that bridge right down there.</i>

1279
01:24:53,289 --> 01:24:56,710
<i>Okay, I'm getting really good rad
readings. Forty-two and higher.</i>

1280
01:24:56,793 --> 01:24:58,211
U p you get.

1281
01:25:02,882 --> 01:25:04,884
<i>Okay, we're dropping in.</i>

1282
01:25:08,888 --> 01:25:11,474
<i>Really strong readings right down
below us. There he is.</i>

1283
01:25:11,599 --> 01:25:13,768
<i>Ship one and two, come on in.</i>

1284
01:25:14,811 --> 01:25:17,480
<i>That's it, right there.
Mark him, mark him.</i>

1285
01:25:17,564 --> 01:25:20,817
<i>Okay, there he is. 11:30. 11:30.
Right off the nose.</i>

1286
01:25:21,317 --> 01:25:22,944
<i>I got it. 12:00.</i>

1287
01:25:26,990 --> 01:25:28,450
<i>Okay, I'm tracking him. I've got him.</i>

1288
01:25:31,411 --> 01:25:33,621
<i>Got him going down the street.</i>

1289
01:25:37,167 --> 01:25:41,796
<i>Okay. Where'd he go, guys? I lost him.
Got no IR signature. Where'd he go?</i>

1290
01:25:42,130 --> 01:25:44,299
<i>Okay, I lost him. I lost him.</i>

1291
01:25:44,841 --> 01:25:46,843
<i>Okay, we're coming around.</i>

1292
01:26:09,532 --> 01:26:11,117
Easy, you two.

1293
01:26:20,460 --> 01:26:23,713
No ! No ! No, Sam ! Sam , don't drop me !

1294
01:26:24,339 --> 01:26:27,383
Sam , don't! Sam , don't! I'm slipping !
I'm slipping !

1295
01:26:28,551 --> 01:26:30,678
-Hold on !
-No !

1296
01:26:34,349 --> 01:26:35,642
Sam !

1297
01:26:41,189 --> 01:26:44,317
<i>All right, we've got him pinned.
We've got him pinned in the river.</i>

1298
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:45,735
<i>I'm in for the shot.</i>

1299
01:26:45,819 --> 01:26:47,237
Stop ! Stop !

1300
01:26:48,404 --> 01:26:50,240
Wait! No !

1301
01:26:53,576 --> 01:26:56,246
<i>-Take the shot, get him.
-Take the shot.</i>

1302
01:26:56,746 --> 01:26:58,039
No !

1303
01:27:14,055 --> 01:27:16,224
No ! Stop !

1304
01:27:16,766 --> 01:27:18,101
Stop !

1305
01:27:18,685 --> 01:27:22,105
<i>Get down on the ground! Get down!
Get down!</i>

1306
01:27:23,106 --> 01:27:24,440
What? Okay.

1307
01:27:26,276 --> 01:27:28,528
Look, he's not fighting back!

1308
01:27:29,070 --> 01:27:31,281
Freeze it! Freeze it! Freeze it!

1309
01:27:37,620 --> 01:27:39,247
Stop hurting him !

1310
01:27:48,631 --> 01:27:50,383
Don't let him move !

1311
01:27:51,092 --> 01:27:52,635
I got him here !

1312
01:28:15,825 --> 01:28:16,951
No !

1313
01:28:20,914 --> 01:28:22,749
Happy to see me again?

1314
01:28:24,167 --> 01:28:26,961
Put him in a car
with his little criminal friend .

1315
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:35,929
I want that thing frozen
and ready for transport!

1316
01:28:44,020 --> 01:28:46,356
Hang back. Let me check it out.

1317
01:28:49,150 --> 01:28:50,610
Optimus,

1318
01:28:52,862 --> 01:28:55,365
are we just gonna stand here
and do nothing?

1319
01:28:55,490 --> 01:28:59,202
There's no way to free Bumblebee
without harming the humans.

1320
01:28:59,285 --> 01:29:02,121
-But it's not right. He. . .
-Let them leave.

1321
01:29:14,050 --> 01:29:16,469
The Chinese and the Russians
are nearing our area of operations

1322
01:29:16,552 --> 01:29:17,720
in the western Pacific.

1323
01:29:17,804 --> 01:29:19,973
We feel like this could get
out of hand real fast.

1324
01:29:20,056 --> 01:29:22,892
But the next couple of hours
may just define his presidency.

1325
01:29:27,188 --> 01:29:30,066
US and Chinese task forces
approaching 1 00 nautical miles

1326
01:29:30,191 --> 01:29:31,484
of cruise missile range.

1327
01:29:31,567 --> 01:29:35,154
Tell the strike group commander that
he's not to engage unless fired on first.

1328
01:29:35,238 --> 01:29:37,240
-Yes, sir!
-Mr. Secretary?

1329
01:29:39,575 --> 01:29:44,664
Tom Banachek. I'm with Sector Seven ,
Advanced Research Division .

1330
01:29:44,747 --> 01:29:48,042
Never heard of it. I'm a little busy, Tom .
I think you can see that.

1331
01:29:51,087 --> 01:29:53,673
-What's going on here?
-I don't know.

1332
01:29:57,260 --> 01:29:59,929
Sit rep ! Talk to me !

1333
01:30:00,054 --> 01:30:02,432
-The whole room's gone down , sir.
-I can see that!

1334
01:30:02,557 --> 01:30:04,267
The virus was coded to shut us down .

1335
01:30:04,350 --> 01:30:06,769
-General?
-I'll take a seat.

1336
01:30:07,603 --> 01:30:08,771
What do you mean , "shut us down"?

1337
01:30:08,855 --> 01:30:11,858
They used our network to spread out
to the whole world .

1338
01:30:11,941 --> 01:30:13,109
The blackout's global .

1339
01:30:13,192 --> 01:30:16,029
We have no communications,
satellite and land lines are dead .

1340
01:30:16,112 --> 01:30:20,616
You mean to tell me that I cannot pick
up this telephone and call my family?

1341
01:30:26,581 --> 01:30:30,918
Mr. Secretary? I'm here under
direct order from the President.

1342
01:30:32,879 --> 01:30:35,298
You really need to see
what I have in the case.

1343
01:30:38,301 --> 01:30:39,886
You'll have to accept that
there are certain things

1344
01:30:39,969 --> 01:30:42,138
you won't understand right away.

1345
01:30:42,221 --> 01:30:45,558
Sector Seven is a special-access
division of the government

1346
01:30:45,641 --> 01:30:49,062
convened in secret under
President Hoover 80 years ago.

1347
01:30:49,896 --> 01:30:53,983
You may remember NASA J PL
lost the Beagle 2 Mars Rover.

1348
01:30:55,109 --> 01:30:59,405
We told them to report the mission
a complete failure. It wasn't.

1349
01:30:59,822 --> 01:31:02,283
Beagle 2 transmitted 1 3 seconds.

1350
01:31:02,825 --> 01:31:05,411
This was classified above top secret.

1351
01:31:20,343 --> 01:31:23,012
<i>EDA ended at 1 70 hours, 48 minutes.</i>

1352
01:31:23,096 --> 01:31:25,765
More than just a pile of Martian rocks.

1353
01:31:27,016 --> 01:31:29,143
This is the image from Mars.

1354
01:31:29,936 --> 01:31:32,688
Here's the image your
Special Ops team was able to retrieve

1355
01:31:32,814 --> 01:31:34,607
from the base attack.

1356
01:31:35,358 --> 01:31:38,486
We believe they are of
the same exoskeletal type,

1357
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:42,115
and obviously not Russian
or North Korean .

1358
01:31:42,490 --> 01:31:45,201
Are we talking about an invasion?

1359
01:31:45,284 --> 01:31:48,371
We intercepted the message
from your Special Ops team .

1360
01:31:48,454 --> 01:31:51,791
These things can be hurt by
our weapons and now they know it.

1361
01:31:51,874 --> 01:31:53,626
That's why the virus shut us down ,

1362
01:31:53,709 --> 01:31:57,046
so we can't coordinate against
their next attack,

1363
01:31:57,130 --> 01:32:01,676
which I would bet my ridiculous
government salary is coming soon .

1364
01:32:05,513 --> 01:32:07,890
Get word to our fleet commanders
over the National Guard frequency.

1365
01:32:07,974 --> 01:32:11,394
It's a shortwave radio channel .
It might be still working .

1366
01:32:11,477 --> 01:32:14,814
Tell them to turn their ships around
and come home. ASAP !

1367
01:32:14,897 --> 01:32:17,900
And inform all commands to prepare
for imminent attack.

1368
01:32:28,077 --> 01:32:31,330
Captain Lennox, we need you and
your team to come with us right now!

1369
01:32:31,414 --> 01:32:32,540
Let's go !

1370
01:32:37,420 --> 01:32:38,921
She's in here.

1371
01:32:39,255 --> 01:32:41,007
What's going on?

1372
01:32:41,507 --> 01:32:43,384
You're coming with me.

1373
01:32:43,759 --> 01:32:46,512
-You're going to be my advisor.
-Me, too?

1374
01:32:47,430 --> 01:32:48,848
Who's this?

1375
01:32:49,599 --> 01:32:52,727
-He's my advisor.
-He comes, too.

1376
01:33:03,946 --> 01:33:06,449
-So. . .
-What'd they get you for?

1377
01:33:07,533 --> 01:33:11,787
I bought a car.
Turned out to be an alien robot.

1378
01:33:11,913 --> 01:33:12,955
Wow.

1379
01:33:13,539 --> 01:33:14,707
Who knew?

1380
01:33:31,474 --> 01:33:33,392
Make a hole ! Watch your back!

1381
01:33:44,153 --> 01:33:46,948
Please, let this work.

1382
01:33:48,324 --> 01:33:50,243
Fire it up, Optimus.

1383
01:33:51,160 --> 01:33:52,662
The code.

1384
01:33:52,787 --> 01:33:58,167
The code on these glasses indicates
the All Spark is 230 miles from here.

1385
01:34:00,002 --> 01:34:03,839
I sense the Decepticons
are getting ready to mobilize.

1386
01:34:04,966 --> 01:34:06,759
They must know it's here, as well .

1387
01:34:06,842 --> 01:34:08,177
What about Bumblebee?

1388
01:34:08,261 --> 01:34:12,348
We can't just leave him to die
and become some human experiment!

1389
01:34:12,431 --> 01:34:16,435
He'll die in vain
if we don't accomplish our mission .

1390
01:34:16,519 --> 01:34:20,773
Bumblebee is a brave soldier.
This is what he would want.

1391
01:34:20,856 --> 01:34:23,859
Why are we fighting to save
the humans?

1392
01:34:25,194 --> 01:34:28,614
<i>They're a primitive and violent race.</i>

1393
01:34:30,866 --> 01:34:32,952
Were we so different?

1394
01:34:33,828 --> 01:34:38,207
<i>They're a young species.
They have much to learn.</i>

1395
01:34:38,291 --> 01:34:41,127
<i>But I've seen goodness in them.</i>

1396
01:34:41,210 --> 01:34:45,381
<i>Freedom is the right of
all sentient beings.</i>

1397
01:34:45,464 --> 01:34:49,719
<i>You all know there's only one way
to end this war.</i>

1398
01:34:49,802 --> 01:34:52,555
<i>We must destroy the Cube.</i>

1399
01:34:53,306 --> 01:34:57,893
If all else fails, I will unite it
with the spark in my chest.

1400
01:34:57,977 --> 01:34:59,312
That's suicide.

1401
01:34:59,395 --> 01:35:03,232
The Cube is raw power.
It could destroy you both .

1402
01:35:03,316 --> 01:35:07,820
A necessary sacrifice to bring peace
to this planet.

1403
01:35:07,903 --> 01:35:11,240
We cannot let the humans pay
for our mistakes.

1404
01:35:12,658 --> 01:35:15,411
It's been an honor serving with you all .

1405
01:35:15,494 --> 01:35:19,248
-Autobots, roll out!
-We rolling !

1406
01:35:31,260 --> 01:35:34,513
Team attention ! Present arms !

1407
01:35:35,097 --> 01:35:39,435
At ease. Captain , Sergeant.
Got your intel . Excellent work.

1408
01:35:39,518 --> 01:35:41,187
Thank you , sir.
What about the gunships?

1409
01:35:41,270 --> 01:35:43,439
They're being retrofitted
with sabot rounds now.

1410
01:35:43,522 --> 01:35:44,774
If they hit us again ,
we'll be ready for them .

1411
01:35:44,899 --> 01:35:48,027
But it won't do us much good if we can't
get world communications back up.

1412
01:35:49,445 --> 01:35:50,780
Hey, kid .

1413
01:35:51,781 --> 01:35:54,450
I think we got off to a bad start, huh?

1414
01:35:54,950 --> 01:35:56,118
You must be hungry?

1415
01:35:56,202 --> 01:35:58,204
You want a latte? HoHo?
Double venti macchiato?

1416
01:35:58,287 --> 01:35:59,955
Where's my car?

1417
01:36:00,039 --> 01:36:03,626
Son , I need you to listen to me
very carefully.

1418
01:36:04,126 --> 01:36:05,795
People can die here.

1419
01:36:06,128 --> 01:36:08,881
We need to know everything you know.
We need to know it now.

1420
01:36:08,964 --> 01:36:10,216
Okay.

1421
01:36:10,299 --> 01:36:14,053
But first, I'll take my car, my parents.
Maybe you should write that down .

1422
01:36:14,136 --> 01:36:18,808
Oh , and her juvie record .
That's got to be gone. Like, forever.

1423
01:36:20,476 --> 01:36:23,479
Come with me.
We'll talk about your car.

1424
01:36:23,562 --> 01:36:24,814
Thank you .

1425
01:36:26,315 --> 01:36:27,817
The man's an extortionist.

1426
01:36:29,777 --> 01:36:31,153
All right, here's the situation .

1427
01:36:31,237 --> 01:36:33,656
You've all had direct contact
with the N BEs.

1428
01:36:33,739 --> 01:36:34,824
N BEs?

1429
01:36:34,907 --> 01:36:38,494
Non-Biological Extraterrestrials.
Try and keep up with the acronyms.

1430
01:36:38,619 --> 01:36:42,289
What you're about to see
is totally classified .

1431
01:36:51,424 --> 01:36:53,300
Dear God . What is this?

1432
01:36:54,844 --> 01:36:58,097
We think when he made his approach
over the north pole,

1433
01:36:58,180 --> 01:37:01,684
our gravitational field screwed up
his telemetry.

1434
01:37:01,767 --> 01:37:05,771
He crashed in the ice,
probably a few thousand years ago.

1435
01:37:05,855 --> 01:37:09,108
We shipped him here to this facility
in 1 934.

1436
01:37:09,191 --> 01:37:11,610
We call him N BE One.

1437
01:37:11,694 --> 01:37:14,113
Well , sir, I don't mean to correct you
on everything you think you know,

1438
01:37:14,196 --> 01:37:16,615
but, I mean , that's Megatron .

1439
01:37:17,867 --> 01:37:19,702
He's the leader of the Decepticons.

1440
01:37:19,785 --> 01:37:23,122
He's been in cryostasis since 1 935.

1441
01:37:23,205 --> 01:37:26,709
Your great-great-grandfather made
one of the greatest discoveries

1442
01:37:26,792 --> 01:37:28,210
in the history of mankind .

1443
01:37:28,335 --> 01:37:31,297
Fact is, you're looking at
the source of the modern age,

1444
01:37:31,380 --> 01:37:38,220
the microchip, lasers, spaceflight, cars,
all reverse-engineered by studying him .

1445
01:37:38,304 --> 01:37:42,141
N BE One. That's what we call it.

1446
01:37:42,683 --> 01:37:45,311
And you didn't think the U nited States
military might need to know

1447
01:37:45,394 --> 01:37:47,813
that you're keeping a hostile alien robot
frozen in the basement?

1448
01:37:47,897 --> 01:37:51,901
U ntil these events, we had no
credible threat to national security.

1449
01:37:51,984 --> 01:37:53,903
Well , you got one now.

1450
01:37:54,737 --> 01:37:57,239
-So why Earth?
-It's the All Spark.

1451
01:37:57,323 --> 01:37:58,824
All Spark? What is that?

1452
01:37:58,908 --> 01:38:01,494
Well , yeah , they came here looking
for some sort of cube-looking thing .

1453
01:38:01,577 --> 01:38:06,415
Anyway, Mr. N BE One here, AKA
Megatron , that's what they call him ,

1454
01:38:06,499 --> 01:38:08,918
who's pretty much the harbinger
of death , wants to use the Cube

1455
01:38:09,001 --> 01:38:12,087
to transform human technology
to take over the universe.

1456
01:38:12,213 --> 01:38:13,756
That's their plan .

1457
01:38:13,839 --> 01:38:16,258
-And you're sure about that?
-Yeah .

1458
01:38:18,594 --> 01:38:20,888
You guys know where it is, don't you?

1459
01:38:22,264 --> 01:38:23,432
Follow me.

1460
01:38:27,061 --> 01:38:29,605
You're about to see our crown jewel .

1461
01:38:38,447 --> 01:38:42,117
Carbon dating puts the Cube here
around 1 0, 000 BC.

1462
01:38:42,952 --> 01:38:45,287
The first Seven didn't find it until 1 91 3.

1463
01:38:47,456 --> 01:38:51,293
They knew it was alien because of
the matching hieroglyphics on the Cube

1464
01:38:51,418 --> 01:38:52,962
as well as N BE One.

1465
01:38:53,045 --> 01:38:55,631
President Hoover had the dam built
around it.

1466
01:38:55,714 --> 01:38:58,133
Four football fields thick of concrete.

1467
01:38:58,217 --> 01:39:01,554
A perfect way to hide its energy
from being detected by anyone

1468
01:39:01,637 --> 01:39:05,266
or any alien species on the outside.

1469
01:39:44,013 --> 01:39:47,850
Wait, back up. You said
the dam hides the Cube's energy.

1470
01:39:48,475 --> 01:39:51,020
-What kind exactly?
-Good question .

1471
01:39:55,524 --> 01:39:58,485
Please step inside.
They have to lock us in .

1472
01:40:04,366 --> 01:40:06,035
Oh , wow.

1473
01:40:06,160 --> 01:40:08,203
What's that? Freddy Krueger done
been up in here or something?

1474
01:40:08,287 --> 01:40:09,496
Oh , no, man .

1475
01:40:09,622 --> 01:40:14,126
Freddy Krueger have four blades, man .
That's only three. That's Wolverine !

1476
01:40:14,209 --> 01:40:17,129
-Right? That's Wolverine !
-That's very funny.

1477
01:40:18,631 --> 01:40:21,717
Anybody have any mechanical devices?
BlackBerry? Key alarm? Cell phone?

1478
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:23,218
I got a phone.

1479
01:40:26,388 --> 01:40:29,058
Nokias are real nasty.

1480
01:40:29,141 --> 01:40:33,562
You've got to respect the Japanese.
They know the way of the samurai .

1481
01:40:34,355 --> 01:40:36,482
Nokia's from Finland .

1482
01:40:36,565 --> 01:40:41,195
Yes, but he's, you know, a little strange.
He's a little strange.

1483
01:40:43,906 --> 01:40:49,536
We're able to take the Cube radiation
and funnel it into that box.

1484
01:41:03,133 --> 01:41:06,470
-Mean little sucker, huh?
-That thing is freaky!

1485
01:41:06,595 --> 01:41:10,265
Kind of like the itty-bitty
Energizer Bunny from hell , huh?

1486
01:41:21,276 --> 01:41:23,153
He's breaking the box.

1487
01:41:41,130 --> 01:41:42,256
Go ! Go ! Go !

1488
01:41:42,339 --> 01:41:43,465
Move !

1489
01:41:51,974 --> 01:41:54,643
Gentlemen , they know the Cube is here.

1490
01:41:55,352 --> 01:41:56,729
Banachek. What's going on?

1491
01:41:56,812 --> 01:41:58,689
Well , the N BE One hangar
has lost power...

1492
01:41:58,814 --> 01:41:59,857
-What?
<i>-. . . and the backup generator</i>

1493
01:41:59,982 --> 01:42:01,942
<i>-is just not gonna cut it.</i>
-Do you have an arms room?

1494
01:42:08,323 --> 01:42:10,075
Megatron ! Megatron ! Megatron !

1495
01:42:10,159 --> 01:42:11,577
I'll bring security to the...

1496
01:42:11,660 --> 01:42:14,204
Get everyone to
the N BE One chamber now!

1497
01:42:14,329 --> 01:42:15,914
-The lights are out!
-Move it! Move it!

1498
01:42:15,998 --> 01:42:17,374
Let's go !

1499
01:42:17,499 --> 01:42:19,293
They're popping our generators !

1500
01:42:31,221 --> 01:42:32,681
Megatron melting !

1501
01:42:33,223 --> 01:42:36,351
<i>16502. We're losing pressure.</i>

1502
01:42:36,477 --> 01:42:38,645
Stand by! Set!

1503
01:42:38,729 --> 01:42:40,814
<i>We're losing pressure!</i>

1504
01:42:40,898 --> 01:42:44,359
<i>The cryogenic system is failing!
We're losing NBE One!</i>

1505
01:42:49,072 --> 01:42:51,784
Forty millimeter sabot rounds
on that table !

1506
01:42:51,867 --> 01:42:55,913
That's good . Get all the ammo you got.
Everything you can carry. Bring it.

1507
01:43:01,418 --> 01:43:04,087
You got to take me to my car.
You have to take me to my car.

1508
01:43:04,213 --> 01:43:05,214
He's gonna know what to do
with the Cube.

1509
01:43:05,339 --> 01:43:07,257
-Your car? It's confiscated .
-Then unconfiscate it.

1510
01:43:07,382 --> 01:43:09,092
We do not know what will happen
if we let it near this thing !

1511
01:43:09,218 --> 01:43:10,469
-You don't know.
-Maybe you know, but I don't know.

1512
01:43:10,552 --> 01:43:11,929
You just wanna sit here and wait
and see what happens?

1513
01:43:12,054 --> 01:43:14,014
I have people's lives at stake here,
young man .

1514
01:43:14,097 --> 01:43:15,891
Take him to his car!

1515
01:43:17,559 --> 01:43:18,811
Drop it.

1516
01:43:20,562 --> 01:43:22,231
Whoa ! Whoa ! Whoa !

1517
01:43:23,482 --> 01:43:25,484
Drop your weapon , soldier.

1518
01:43:25,984 --> 01:43:27,736
There's an alien war going on
and you're gonna shoot me?

1519
01:43:27,820 --> 01:43:28,862
You know, we didn't ask to be here.

1520
01:43:28,946 --> 01:43:31,156
I'm ordering you under S-Seven
executive jurisdiction .

1521
01:43:31,240 --> 01:43:32,449
S-Seven don't exist.

1522
01:43:32,574 --> 01:43:34,326
Right. And we don't take orders
from people that don't exist.

1523
01:43:34,409 --> 01:43:37,663
-I'm gonna count to five. Okay.
-Well , I'm gonna count to three.

1524
01:43:40,249 --> 01:43:41,917
-Simmons?
-Yes, sir?

1525
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:46,088
I'd do what he says. Losing's really
not an option for these guys.

1526
01:43:50,592 --> 01:43:52,553
All right. Okay.

1527
01:43:52,636 --> 01:43:57,224
Hey, you want to lay the fate of the
world on the kid's Camaro? That's cool .

1528
01:44:00,686 --> 01:44:02,020
No, no !

1529
01:44:02,938 --> 01:44:05,649
Stop ! You got to stop ! Stop ! Stop ! Stop !

1530
01:44:05,774 --> 01:44:09,319
No, no, stop, stop, stop !
Let him go ! Let him go !

1531
01:44:10,487 --> 01:44:11,947
Are you okay?

1532
01:44:13,782 --> 01:44:15,868
They didn't hurt you , right?

1533
01:44:24,626 --> 01:44:28,463
Listen to me. The Cube is here
and the Decepticons are coming .

1534
01:44:30,799 --> 01:44:32,926
No, no, don't worry about them .
They're okay. Right?

1535
01:44:33,010 --> 01:44:35,262
They're not gonna hurt you .

1536
01:44:35,345 --> 01:44:38,891
J ust back up a little bit.
He's friendly. He's fine.

1537
01:44:38,974 --> 01:44:42,269
Okay, come on . Put the guns down .
They're not gonna hurt you .

1538
01:44:42,352 --> 01:44:43,896
Here, come with me.
I'm gonna take you to the All Spark.

1539
01:45:05,918 --> 01:45:09,421
Okay, here we go. He doing something .
He doing something .

1540
01:45:29,524 --> 01:45:30,901
Oh , my God .

1541
01:45:35,656 --> 01:45:37,115
<i>Message from Starfleet, Captain.</i>

1542
01:45:37,199 --> 01:45:38,617
<i>Let's get to it.</i>

1543
01:45:38,700 --> 01:45:41,745
He's right. We stay here, we're screwed
with Megatron in the other hangar.

1544
01:45:41,828 --> 01:45:43,246
Mission City is 22 miles away.

1545
01:45:43,330 --> 01:45:44,623
We're gonna sneak that Cube
out of here

1546
01:45:44,706 --> 01:45:45,999
and we're gonna hide it somewhere
in the city.

1547
01:45:46,083 --> 01:45:47,209
Good ! Right.

1548
01:45:47,292 --> 01:45:50,045
But we cannot make a stand
without the Air Force.

1549
01:45:50,128 --> 01:45:52,214
This place must have some kind
of radio link!

1550
01:45:52,297 --> 01:45:54,174
-Yes. Shortwave, CB.
-Right, yes.

1551
01:45:54,257 --> 01:45:56,885
Sir, you got to figure out some way
to get word out to them . Let's move !

1552
01:45:56,969 --> 01:45:58,428
In the alien archive, sir!

1553
01:45:58,512 --> 01:46:00,514
-The alien . . .
-There's an old Army radio console.

1554
01:46:00,597 --> 01:46:02,182
-Will it work?
-Anything's possible !

1555
01:46:02,265 --> 01:46:04,685
-Did you see that. . .
-All right, Sam , get it in the car!

1556
01:46:04,768 --> 01:46:06,561
Mr. Secretary! Get our birds in the air.

1557
01:46:06,645 --> 01:46:08,313
When we get to the city,
we're gonna find a radio,

1558
01:46:08,397 --> 01:46:10,357
and I'll have Epps vector them in , okay?

1559
01:46:10,440 --> 01:46:12,025
Affirmative !

1560
01:46:12,109 --> 01:46:15,946
<i>Warning! NBE One
cryo-containment failing.</i>

1561
01:46:16,905 --> 01:46:18,824
Check that backup system !

1562
01:46:18,907 --> 01:46:23,078
The cryo's failing ! You got to bump up
the cryo ! The cryo's failing !

1563
01:46:23,161 --> 01:46:24,705
Come on ! Get out of here !

1564
01:46:24,788 --> 01:46:26,331
Heads up ! Look out!

1565
01:46:27,290 --> 01:46:29,710
Set a perimeter around
the yellow vehicle !

1566
01:46:29,793 --> 01:46:33,255
-This way, this way, this way!
-U p there ! Let's go !

1567
01:46:42,931 --> 01:46:46,059
I am Megatron !

1568
01:47:04,828 --> 01:47:06,246
-The Cube's okay?
-Yeah , it's fine.

1569
01:47:06,329 --> 01:47:07,372
Well , put the seat belt on .

1570
01:47:07,456 --> 01:47:08,623
Pour it on him !

1571
01:47:22,345 --> 01:47:24,389
I live to serve you , Lord Megatron .

1572
01:47:24,473 --> 01:47:26,892
Where is the Cube?

1573
01:47:26,975 --> 01:47:29,061
The humans have taken it.

1574
01:47:32,397 --> 01:47:36,276
You fail me yet again , Starscream .
Get them !

1575
01:47:36,693 --> 01:47:38,195
Come on , Mags !

1576
01:47:39,279 --> 01:47:40,781
Over here, sir!

1577
01:47:43,116 --> 01:47:45,202
Give me a minute. Give me a minute.

1578
01:47:45,285 --> 01:47:47,746
Come to me, Maxwell , come to me.
Plugged in there.

1579
01:47:49,623 --> 01:47:53,126
-We're hot! We're live !
-Where are the mikes?

1580
01:47:54,002 --> 01:47:55,128
Mikes?

1581
01:47:55,212 --> 01:47:56,505
This doesn't work without mikes,
Simmons.

1582
01:47:56,588 --> 01:47:58,173
No, no, no, no, no, no, no !

1583
01:47:58,256 --> 01:47:59,800
Let's find them .

1584
01:47:59,883 --> 01:48:01,384
Kid , get in the chair!
J ust get in the chair, all right?

1585
01:48:01,468 --> 01:48:03,637
-Okay, I'll sit. I'll sit.
-They steal everything out of this place.

1586
01:48:03,720 --> 01:48:06,807
How do we get the signal out?
How do we call the Air Force?

1587
01:48:06,890 --> 01:48:08,225
-Glen?
-H uh?

1588
01:48:08,308 --> 01:48:11,812
Can you hotwire this computer to
transmit a tone through the radio?

1589
01:48:11,895 --> 01:48:12,938
What good is that?

1590
01:48:13,021 --> 01:48:15,440
Morse code ! You can use this
to transmit it through that!

1591
01:48:15,524 --> 01:48:19,111
Okay, I'll do it! Turn it around .
Okay, let's see.

1592
01:48:19,194 --> 01:48:21,029
Simmons, I need a screwdriver!

1593
01:48:32,791 --> 01:48:34,334
There's Optimus.

1594
01:48:52,269 --> 01:48:53,770
Almost done.

1595
01:48:55,564 --> 01:48:57,524
What the hell was that?

1596
01:49:00,569 --> 01:49:02,279
Barricade the door!

1597
01:49:04,990 --> 01:49:07,409
-Get something .
-Watch out!

1598
01:49:07,492 --> 01:49:09,578
Six, five, four, six, three.

1599
01:49:14,249 --> 01:49:16,626
Here ! Put some rounds in !

1600
01:49:19,462 --> 01:49:20,922
Master search .

1601
01:49:21,798 --> 01:49:23,842
I got it! We're transmitting !

1602
01:49:23,925 --> 01:49:25,093
Send exactly what I say!

1603
01:49:25,177 --> 01:49:29,306
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!
Burn , you little sucker! Burn !

1604
01:49:29,389 --> 01:49:33,435
"This is Defense Secretary Keller.
Get me NORTHCOM commander."

1605
01:49:33,518 --> 01:49:35,103
-Whoa !
-Whoa !

1606
01:49:36,730 --> 01:49:37,814
What was that?

1607
01:49:37,898 --> 01:49:40,775
Authenticate emergency action .
Blackbird 11 95...

1608
01:49:42,903 --> 01:49:44,988
Sir, I have an authenticated
air strike order from Sec Def.

1609
01:50:09,804 --> 01:50:11,806
-No, no, no, no, no.
-What?

1610
01:50:11,890 --> 01:50:15,352
It's the same cop !
Block them , block them , block them .

1611
01:50:36,498 --> 01:50:37,624
Oh , my God .

1612
01:51:06,111 --> 01:51:07,487
Cool , Mom !

1613
01:51:33,346 --> 01:51:35,390
This is so not good .

1614
01:51:53,825 --> 01:51:55,744
He's behind the pillar!

1615
01:52:01,583 --> 01:52:04,711
-Shoot that mother. . .
-Maggie, cover fire !

1616
01:52:07,756 --> 01:52:10,175
It's the Air Force ! They're responding !

1617
01:52:14,012 --> 01:52:16,014
Sucker, burn !

1618
01:52:21,770 --> 01:52:23,104
Oh , shit!

1619
01:52:23,438 --> 01:52:25,440
Yes ! They're sending F-22s to the city!

1620
01:52:26,608 --> 01:52:28,735
<i>Raptors, let's scramble,
scramble, scramble.</i>

1621
01:52:29,903 --> 01:52:32,197
<i>Strike and Dark Star roll call.</i>

1622
01:52:34,449 --> 01:52:35,950
<i>Looking out the right side.</i>

1623
01:52:36,868 --> 01:52:39,079
<i>Push to Kill Box One Alpha...</i>

1624
01:52:46,628 --> 01:52:50,215
-Come on , let's go ! Mount up !
-Move out! Move out! Go ! Go !

1625
01:52:50,298 --> 01:52:52,467
Here, I got shortwave radios.

1626
01:52:52,967 --> 01:52:55,220
Wait. What am I supposed to
do with these?

1627
01:52:55,303 --> 01:52:57,639
Well , use them ! It's all we got!

1628
01:52:57,972 --> 01:53:01,059
This is like RadioShack dinosaur radios
or something , man .

1629
01:53:01,142 --> 01:53:04,062
I'm only gonna get 20 or 30 miles
out of these things.

1630
01:53:04,145 --> 01:53:06,898
Are there any aircraft orbiting the city?

1631
01:53:07,482 --> 01:53:09,067
F-22 at 1 2: 00.

1632
01:53:09,150 --> 01:53:11,903
All right, I want planes for air cover
and get Black Hawks on station

1633
01:53:11,986 --> 01:53:13,822
to extract that Cube. You got it?

1634
01:53:16,324 --> 01:53:18,785
Air Force has arrived ! Pop smoke !

1635
01:53:18,993 --> 01:53:20,662
Raptor, Raptor, do you copy?

1636
01:53:21,955 --> 01:53:23,164
<i>We have you visual.</i>

1637
01:53:24,791 --> 01:53:26,167
<i>Green smoke is the mark.</i>

1638
01:53:26,251 --> 01:53:29,671
<i>Provide air cover and vector
Black Hawks for extraction.</i>

1639
01:53:34,342 --> 01:53:36,344
It's Starscream !

1640
01:53:36,761 --> 01:53:38,471
Please tell me you copy.

1641
01:53:38,763 --> 01:53:41,099
Back up ! Take cover! Bumblebee !

1642
01:53:44,853 --> 01:53:46,855
No, no, no, no, no ! Move !

1643
01:53:46,980 --> 01:53:50,108
-Back up ! Back up !
-Retreat! Fall back!

1644
01:53:50,191 --> 01:53:51,484
Incoming !

1645
01:54:16,551 --> 01:54:18,386
Anybody hurt? Everyone okay?

1646
01:54:18,470 --> 01:54:19,888
Clear the area !

1647
01:54:25,727 --> 01:54:27,228
Oh , my God .

1648
01:54:28,062 --> 01:54:31,024
Bumblebee? No. Your legs !

1649
01:54:31,399 --> 01:54:32,734
Your legs.

1650
01:54:34,319 --> 01:54:37,989
Here. Here, back, back, back, back!

Ratchet!

-What the hell was that?
-What are you talking about?

1654
01:54:48,166 --> 01:54:50,084
What do you mean , what am
I talking about? They shot at us !

1655
01:54:50,210 --> 01:54:52,587
F-22 pilots would never fly
below buildings.

1656
01:54:52,670 --> 01:54:54,839
That's alien . That ain't friendly!

1657
01:54:54,923 --> 01:54:57,759
You got to get up. You're okay.

Get our guys out of the way!

1673
01:57:27,075 --> 01:57:29,160
Get them out of the buggy! Move out!

1674
01:57:29,243 --> 01:57:31,496
We need air cover down here now!

1675
01:57:37,502 --> 01:57:38,920
Sam , help me with this.

1676
01:57:43,049 --> 01:57:47,387
-That all you got, Megatron?
-Come here, little cretin .

1677
01:57:47,470 --> 01:57:49,597
You want a piece of me?
You want a piece?

1678
01:57:49,722 --> 01:57:51,974
No ! I want two !

1679
01:57:53,559 --> 01:57:54,977
What's going on?

1680
01:57:56,771 --> 01:57:59,440
Sir! That tank thing's getting back up.

1681
01:58:00,274 --> 01:58:02,568
Oh , these things just don't die.

1682
01:58:06,114 --> 01:58:07,615
Oh , we're so dead .

1683
01:58:07,740 --> 01:58:09,992
-Wrap it around the head .
-Sam !

1684
01:58:10,118 --> 01:58:11,202
Where's the Cube?

1685
01:58:11,285 --> 01:58:12,328
-Right there.
-Okay.

1686
01:58:12,453 --> 01:58:13,496
And take that and wrap it around

1687

around his neck.

1688
01:58:14,747 --> 01:58:17,417
-Okay?
-Epps, get those Black Hawks here !

1689

-Okay.
-What?

1691
01:58:25,967 --> 01:58:28,886
All right, I can't leave my guys back
there, so here, take this flare.

1692
01:58:28,970 --> 01:58:31,264
Okay, there's a tall , white building
with statues on top.

1693
01:58:31,347 --> 01:58:33,558
-Go to the roof. Set the flare.
-No.

1694
01:58:33,641 --> 01:58:35,601
-Signal the chopper and set the flare.
-No, no. I can't do this !

1695
01:58:35,685 --> 01:58:40,106
Listen to me ! You're a soldier now!
All right? I need you to take this Cube.

1696
01:58:40,189 --> 01:58:42,442
Get it into military hands
while we hold them off,

1697
01:58:42,525 --> 01:58:44,610
or a lot of people are gonna die.

1698
01:58:44,694 --> 01:58:46,237
-You got to go. You got to go.
-No, I'm not leaving .

1699
01:58:46,320 --> 01:58:47,530
-You need to go. Go.
-No, I'm not leaving

1700
01:58:47,655 --> 01:58:50,324
till I get Bumblebee out of here, okay?

1701
01:58:51,784 --> 01:58:52,869
Army Black Hawk requested .

Immediate evac for civilian boy
with precious cargo.

<i>Headed to rooftop marked by flare.</i>

1704

-Sam , we will protect you .
-Okay.

1705
01:59:02,879 --> 01:59:06,299
-Epps, where are those planes?
-Sam !

1706
01:59:10,219 --> 01:59:14,390
No matter what happens,
I'm really glad I got in that car with you .

1707
01:59:17,643 --> 01:59:20,271
Sam ! Get to the building ! Move !

1708
01:59:20,354 --> 01:59:23,649
-Decepticons, attack!
-H it it!

1709
01:59:26,319 --> 01:59:28,488
-Cover fire !
-Move to cover!

1710
01:59:34,869 --> 01:59:36,204
Watch out!

-Girl , get that tow truck out of here !
-I'm going ! I'm going !

1712

Get out of here now!

1713
02:00:14,408 --> 02:00:15,576
Megatron !

Prime.

1715
02:00:42,603 --> 02:00:44,689
H umans don't deserve to live.

1716
02:00:44,772 --> 02:00:47,483
They deserve to choose for themselves.

1717
02:00:47,900 --> 02:00:50,278
Then you will die with them !

1718
02:00:55,950 --> 02:00:58,411
Join them in extinction !

1719

Keep moving , Sam !

1720

Sam , get to the building !

1723
02:02:03,851 --> 02:02:06,020
Give me that Cube, boy!

1724
02:02:18,574 --> 02:02:20,743
Did that jerk just dent my car?

1725
02:02:42,056 --> 02:02:45,559
You're not gonna get me.
You're not gonna get me !

1726
02:02:50,856 --> 02:02:54,026
I smell you , boy!

1727
02:03:06,205 --> 02:03:07,415
Maggot!

1728
02:03:26,350 --> 02:03:27,977
Oh , no !

1729
02:03:52,501 --> 02:03:54,378
I'll drive ! You shoot!

1730
02:04:15,316 --> 02:04:16,650
This isn't going well !

1731
02:04:16,734 --> 02:04:18,152
Shoot! Shoot!

1732
02:05:03,948 --> 02:05:05,241
N ice shot.

1733
02:05:05,366 --> 02:05:08,786
-That tank is definitely dead now.
-All right, let's go ! We got business !

1734
02:05:19,255 --> 02:05:20,381
Hey!

1735
02:05:23,801 --> 02:05:27,263
Hey! I'm over here !

1736
02:05:39,567 --> 02:05:41,318
We've got the boy.

1737
02:05:45,906 --> 02:05:47,324
Watch out!

1738
02:05:47,658 --> 02:05:48,909
Missile !

1739
02:05:59,336 --> 02:06:00,838
Hang on , Sam !

1740
02:06:09,513 --> 02:06:10,890
No ! No !

1741
02:06:16,562 --> 02:06:21,650
Is it fear or courage
that compels you , fleshling?

1742
02:06:35,164 --> 02:06:36,665
Where do I go?

1743
02:06:37,958 --> 02:06:41,962
Give me the All Spark
and you may live to be my pet.

1744
02:06:43,214 --> 02:06:44,882
Oh , no, no, no, no.

1745
02:06:49,053 --> 02:06:51,513
I'm never giving you this All Spark!

1746
02:06:51,597 --> 02:06:54,433
Oh , so unwise.

1747
02:07:06,362 --> 02:07:07,905
I got you , boy.

1748
02:07:09,657 --> 02:07:11,492
Hold on to the Cube !

1749
02:07:31,136 --> 02:07:34,056
-Oh , no. Oh , no !
-Disgusting .

1750
02:07:39,019 --> 02:07:40,104
Sam?

1751
02:07:44,316 --> 02:07:47,611
You risked your life to protect the Cube.

1752
02:07:48,279 --> 02:07:49,780
No sacrifice,

1753
02:07:51,115 --> 02:07:54,243
-no victory.
-If I cannot defeat Megatron ,

1754
02:07:54,535 --> 02:07:57,079
you must push the Cube into my chest.

1755
02:07:57,454 --> 02:08:00,666
I will sacrifice myself to destroy it.

1756
02:08:01,125 --> 02:08:02,626
Get behind me.

1757
02:08:04,295 --> 02:08:06,880
It's you and me, Megatron .

1758
02:08:06,964 --> 02:08:09,925
No, it's just me, Prime.

1759
02:08:12,303 --> 02:08:17,474
At the end of this day,
one shall stand , one shall fall .

1760
02:08:22,855 --> 02:08:27,735
You still fight for the weak!
That is why you lose !

1761
02:08:46,837 --> 02:08:49,298
Fighter jets in 60 seconds.

1762
02:08:49,381 --> 02:08:51,842
We got friendlies mixed with bad guys.
Targets will be marked .

1763
02:08:51,925 --> 02:08:53,010
Hey.

1764
02:08:54,178 --> 02:08:56,347
Bring the rain . All right?

1765
02:08:56,722 --> 02:08:58,766
All right, let's kill these things.

1766
02:09:00,684 --> 02:09:02,311
-Move, move, move !
-Remember, aim low.

1767
02:09:02,394 --> 02:09:04,396
Armor's weak under the chest.

1768
02:09:14,448 --> 02:09:16,033
Target marked . Still waiting .

1769
02:09:16,116 --> 02:09:18,202
<i>Time on target, 20 seconds.</i>

1770
02:09:25,084 --> 02:09:27,211
F-22s, we're still waiting .

1771
02:09:32,424 --> 02:09:33,884
Move out!

1772
02:09:37,096 --> 02:09:38,389
Incoming !

1773
02:09:46,897 --> 02:09:49,024
<i>Weapons armed. Status green.</i>

1774
02:10:07,626 --> 02:10:09,503
Run ! Move !

1775
02:10:16,969 --> 02:10:18,554
<i>Second wave's on approach.</i>

1776
02:10:22,015 --> 02:10:23,642
<i>What is that? Break off!</i>

1777
02:10:23,725 --> 02:10:26,228
<i>-Copy.
-It's either a massive amount of . .</i>

1778
02:10:34,945 --> 02:10:37,114
<i>Two, get a lock! Pop that guy!</i>

1779
02:10:41,160 --> 02:10:43,203
<i>Stay on him. Keep him in your sights.</i>

1780
02:10:43,537 --> 02:10:44,955
Take him out!

1781
02:10:59,136 --> 02:11:00,512
Two's down !

1782
02:11:09,897 --> 02:11:11,899
I'll kill you !

1783
02:11:11,982 --> 02:11:14,735
Mine ! All Spark!

1784
02:11:15,694 --> 02:11:18,572
Sam ! Put the Cube in my chest! Now!

1785
02:11:19,239 --> 02:11:20,407
Sam !

1786
02:11:21,158 --> 02:11:22,409
No, Sam !

1787
02:11:48,185 --> 02:11:49,394
Hold up.

1788
02:11:52,439 --> 02:11:55,442
You left me no choice, brother.

1789
02:12:05,035 --> 02:12:07,955
Sam , I owe you my life.

1790
02:12:09,039 --> 02:12:10,791
We are in your debt.

1791
02:12:30,310 --> 02:12:32,729
Prime, we couldn't save him .

1792
02:12:33,564 --> 02:12:34,898
Jazz.

1793
02:12:38,068 --> 02:12:40,320
We lost a great comrade

1794
02:12:41,613 --> 02:12:43,490
but gained new ones.

1795
02:12:43,740 --> 02:12:46,076
Thank you , all of you .

1796
02:12:46,410 --> 02:12:48,787
You honor us with your bravery.

1797
02:12:49,788 --> 02:12:51,790
Permission to speak, sir?

1798
02:12:52,249 --> 02:12:55,168
Permission granted , old friend .

1799
02:12:55,252 --> 02:12:56,753
You speak now?

1800
02:12:57,629 --> 02:12:59,756
I wish to stay with the boy.

1801
02:13:00,591 --> 02:13:02,467
If that is his choice.

1802
02:13:07,347 --> 02:13:08,515
Yes.

1803
02:13:29,036 --> 02:13:33,832
Gentlemen , the President has ordered
Sector Seven be terminated

1804
02:13:34,333 --> 02:13:37,377
and the remains of the dead aliens
disposed of.

1805
02:13:38,003 --> 02:13:41,298
<i>The Laurentian Abyss is
seven miles below sea level,</i>

1806
02:13:41,381 --> 02:13:43,550
<i>deepest place on our planet.</i>

1807
02:13:43,717 --> 02:13:47,304
<i>The massive depth and pressure there,
coupled with subfreezing temperatures,</i>

1808
02:13:47,387 --> 02:13:49,640
<i>would crush and entomb them,</i>

1809
02:13:51,391 --> 02:13:53,143
<i>leaving no evidence.</i>

1810
02:13:59,733 --> 02:14:04,196
<i>With the All Spark gone,
we cannot return life to our planet.</i>

1811
02:14:05,906 --> 02:14:08,533
<i>And fate has yielded its reward,</i>

1812
02:14:10,035 --> 02:14:12,996
<i>a new world to call home.</i>

1813
02:14:19,211 --> 02:14:23,423
<i>We live among its people now,
hiding in plain sight,</i>

1814
02:14:23,548 --> 02:14:26,343
<i>but watching over them in secret,</i>

1815
02:14:26,551 --> 02:14:29,179
<i>waiting, protecting.</i>

1816
02:14:30,514 --> 02:14:33,600
<i>I have witnessed
their capacity for courage.</i>

1817
02:14:34,184 --> 02:14:37,187
<i>And though we are worlds apart,</i>

1818
02:14:37,270 --> 02:14:42,234
<i>like us, there's more to them
than meets the eye.</i>

1819
02:14:43,735 --> 02:14:46,279
<i>I am Optimus Prime</i>

1820
02:14:46,613 --> 02:14:50,033
<i>and I send this message
to any surviving Autobots</i>

1821
02:14:50,117 --> 02:14:53,120
<i>taking refuge among the stars.</i>

1822
02:14:54,121 --> 02:14:55,914
<i>We are here.</i>

1823
02:14:56,456 --> 02:14:58,542
<i>We are waiting.</i>

1824
02:15:17,769 --> 02:15:22,816
Can you shed any light on the recent,
so-called alien activity in the area?

1825
02:15:25,819 --> 02:15:31,324
Do you know what? I think that
if there was some sort of an alien

1826
02:15:31,908 --> 02:15:33,827
-infestation . . .
-Yeah .

1827
02:15:34,161 --> 02:15:36,663
They, the government,
would be the first to let you know.

1828
02:15:36,747 --> 02:15:38,415
The government would let us know.

1829
02:15:38,582 --> 02:15:40,167
-I mean , this is America.
-Yeah .

1830
02:15:40,292 --> 02:15:42,753
You know, that's how we know
we live in a free land ,

1831
02:15:42,836 --> 02:15:44,421
because there's no secrets.

1832
02:15:44,504 --> 02:15:46,673
They'd say, "Hey! Duck and cover."

1833
02:15:56,683 --> 02:16:00,020
Your head is kind of a different size
than it is on television .
