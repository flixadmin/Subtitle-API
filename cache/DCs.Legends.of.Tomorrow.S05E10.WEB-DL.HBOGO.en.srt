1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,600
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,160
- How did you do that?
- How did I do that?

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,480
Remember when we dented history?

4
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,040
By building Heyworld,
we changed the future.

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,880
What you think of as a haunting
is a temporal echo.

6
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,120
She is the you before you.

7
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,960
- Sara, no.
- My sister...

8
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,080
- You can't kill me.
- No!

9
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,280
I'm a god.

10
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,400
We're being hunted
by a pair of bloody gods.

11
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,520
This situation just got
a hell of a lot more dicey.

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,400
Behrad, he's dead.
Can that Loom bring him back?

13
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,520
If we get the last piece, yeah.

14
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,520
Oh, there you are.

15
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,840
It's always the artsy types with you,
ain't it?

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,000
How many times must I tell you

17
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,880
my powers are not a tool
for your amusement, Clotho?

18
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,160
<i>Wait, wait, wait... time-out.</i>

19
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,040
But you did look different
at the time, though, right?

20
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,640
Shapeshifter. 'Course I did.

21
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,400
But it makes the story easier
to imagine, if you just picture me.

22
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,160
- Yeah, just pay attention.
- Yeah, yeah.

23
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,480
Anyway, then she said her
magic word...

24
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,200
Enchantress.

25
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,800
I imagine this has something to do
with your theft of the Loom of Fate?

26
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,240
You disapprove?

27
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,400
No.

28
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,000
Humanity's status quo should be
shaken up every few millennia.

29
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,600
It's good for them.

30
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,280
Well, I'm glad you think so,

31
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,040
because this is a pretty
big shake-up.

32
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,400
I need to make sure
that no one ever finds this.

33
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,280
Not even me,
and especially not Lachesis.

34
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,160
- You think you can do that?
<i>- Question.</i>

35
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,400
- La-who?
- Lachesis.

36
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,560
She's my older sister
and also the leader of the Fates.

37
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,560
Now, she's a real master manipulator.

38
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,600
Atropos kills because Lachesis
wills it.

39
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,880
It is you, Clotho,
that has the difficult task.

40
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,760
What, running and hiding?

41
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,600
I am relieving you
of a piece of the Loom

42
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,920
that has been your entire reason
for existence.

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,840
Now, that you are free of it...

44
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,360
it will be up to you
to determine what, if anything,

45
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,240
is left of Clotho in its wake.

46
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:56,040
All I need is to make sure that
that ring is never found.

47
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,520
Existential actualization
can come later.

48
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,760
You cannot run forever, Clotho.

49
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,720
And that's the last thing I remember.

50
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,120
You have no idea
what spell Enchantress cast?

51
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,480
That would defeat the whole point
of going to her, now, wouldn't it?

52
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,400
Charlie, all we need is the third
ring to bring Behrad back.

53
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,480
And now, you're telling us
it's impossible to find?

54
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,320
Maybe you could have mentioned that
before your sister got on the ship.

55
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,400
See, this is exactly the kind of
thing I was afraid would happen.

56
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,040
Stop! Passing blame
is not gonna help anything.

57
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,360
I'm sorry, Z.

58
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,600
This Enchantress is a witch, right?

59
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,160
Well, we have...
whatever it is you are.

60
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,240
So, do some hocus-pocus
and find the ring.

61
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,000
Yeah, well, it's not as simple
as finding Atropos' ring, love.

62
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,000
Locating something hidden by someone
as powerful as Enchantress,

63
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,560
that can take months,
maybe even years.

64
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,840
I don't accept that.

65
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,400
Behrad is gone
and he's not coming back

66
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,800
until you find the ring.

67
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,440
So, figure it out, magic man.

68
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,960
Fast.

69
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,040
Hey.

70
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:23,120
{\an5}You know, I'm here for you if you
ever want to talk about Behrad.

71
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,240
We're getting him back.

72
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,400
{\an5}There's no point in dwelling on it,

73
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,400
{\an5}because everything's going
to be fine.

74
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,200
- Totally.
- By the way,

75
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,400
{\an5}when I went on
that totem journey thing...

76
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,480
I met the other me.

77
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,880
Really?

78
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,560
{\an5}How... how is she?

79
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,680
She's great. Tough, cool...

80
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,840
{\an5}You must have a thing
for warrior women.

81
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,920
{\an5}Only if they're from another
time period

82
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,120
{\an5}and eventually will leave me.
Sure.

83
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,760
Did she have a message for me?

84
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,000
No.

85
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,560
{\an5}But I can tell
she really cares about you.

86
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,800
{\an5}I really care about her.

87
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,320
And just so you know, I...

88
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,360
care about you, too.

89
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,360
Oh, all right, lovebirds,
look, I think I've got something.

90
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,560
Now, it won't be pretty,
but it might just work.

91
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,840
{\an5}So, come on. Chop-chop.

92
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,680
{\an5}Sara! Are you there?

93
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,960
Hey, Sara!

94
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,200
Sara?

95
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,320
- You all right?
- Yeah. I just...

96
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,400
It was nothing. I'm good.

97
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,640
{\an5}Listen, you got hit full-force
with the power of Atropos.

98
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,960
- Yeah?
- I know you survived,

99
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,440
{\an5}but there still could be
repercussions.

100
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,560
{\an5}Charlie... look, I'm telling you,
I'm completely fine. All right?

101
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,600
Assassin's honor.

102
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,400
Fine.

103
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,280
{\an5}All right, you lot. Listen up.

104
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,520
{\an5}Lachesis' ring could be anywhere
in space and time.

105
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,520
{\an5}I'm going to need to borrow
a little bit of magical energy

106
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,880
{\an5}off you lot to help amplify
the summoning spell.

107
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,360
- Exactly how does that work?
- That's easy.

108
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,760
{\an5}All you need to do
is keep your mouths shut

109
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,680
{\an5}and let me use your auras
like batteries.

110
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,520
-Is this safe? It doesn't sound safe.
- It isn't.

111
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,520
Any more questions? Good.
Let's hold hands.

112
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,240
- Whoa. This feels weird!
- It is weird.

113
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,280
Kinda like that time
we went mushroom picking.

114
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,520
Focus, or you'll botch
the bloody spell!

115
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,320
- Sara!
- Focus!

116
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,880
Where is everyone?

117
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,720
Wait. Something happened.

118
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,600
Oh, bollocks.

119
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,280
{\an5}When everyone lost focus,

120
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,000
{\an5}I had successfully
bound the ring to the house,

121
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,400
but I was still working
to anchor it temporally.

122
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,320
So, you, me and the ring
have been whooshed into the past?

123
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,400
Good work.

124
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,760
It's magic, love.
It's more of an art than a science.

125
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,480
{\an5}Oh, my, are those guests?
I didn't hear the bell ring.

126
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,840
{\an5}Well, hello! I'm Mrs. Hughes.
I'm so sorry to keep you waiting.

127
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,880
Oh, no bother, love.

128
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,720
This is a lovely... boarding house.

129
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,640
You know,
I could see myself living here.

130
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,760
Now, wherever did my <i>etui</i> get to?

131
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,880
Is it that?

132
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,960
Thank you, my dear.

133
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,880
I would have found it eventually.

134
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,840
Sometimes, one just needs
to stop looking.

135
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,400
Right, totally.

136
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,240
Oh, is that another guest already?

137
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,200
It is, indeed.

138
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,600
Doctor White at your service.

139
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,160
Were you two
going to book a room, or...

140
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,440
Right you are.
Yes. Me and my wife here...

141
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,640
Oh, we're not married.

142
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,040
Well, I'm afraid
I'm a bit traditional.

143
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,720
I don't allow single women
to stay in my establishment.

144
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,200
But we are engaged. Yay!

145
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,360
My sincerest congratulations!

146
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,240
- Please sign here.
- Oh, yes, of course.

147
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,000
And you will be in
room number three, upstairs.

148
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,920
Supper is at 8.00, sharp.

149
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,280
All right, thank you.
Mr. White.

150
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,280
You know, you should take note.

151
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,120
This place can actually look decent
with a bit of TLC.

152
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,880
See what a difference a nice set
of curtains can make?

153
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:36,360
Yeah, all right. Now, let's take
stock of our situation, shall we?

154
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,880
Now, I'm assuming you can wield
the totem like Behrad.

155
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,720
I'm just holding onto this for him.

156
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,000
I don't have a superpower.

157
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,880
Unless you count having
flawless brows.

158
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,000
I don't.

159
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,400
Oh, and by age 15,

160
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,240
I built a social media empire
valued at over 500 million dollars.

161
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,400
The New York Times called me
the most influential influencer

162
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,040
- of my generation.
- Oh, The New York Times, eh?

163
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,720
Yeah, it's, like,
an app that tells you the news.

164
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:00,560
So, your superpower
is that you're sort of popular?

165
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,560
Oh, calling me "sort of" popular

166
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,640
is like calling da Vinci "sort of"
a genius.

167
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,760
Great. Got it.

168
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,040
What about you?
What exactly do you do,

169
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,080
besides wear the same outfit
everyday, and screw up spells?

170
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,080
I've banished demons, slain dragons
and walked through the fires of Hell.

171
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,400
I'm a sneaky bastard and the greatest
sorcerer that ever lived.

172
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,960
Cool, cool, cool. Do you wanna
go ahead and "sorcer" something

173
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,760
so, we can find the ring
and get out of here?

174
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,680
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

175
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,720
Okay.
So, does that mean it's in there?

176
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,440
Yeah, it seems so.
This is the doctor's room.

177
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,760
Maybe you could, "influence"
him out while I go check it out?

178
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,840
See? You need my skill set already.

179
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,040
Yeah, all right. Good luck.

180
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,360
Can I help you?

181
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,680
I seem to have come down
with something, Doctor.

182
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,280
Might you be able to give me
a checkup?

183
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,360
Of course. I'd be happy to help.

184
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,640
Please. Come in.

185
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,840
Perhaps we could go down
to the sitting room.

186
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,400
I am a newly-engaged woman,
after all.

187
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,880
I understand. One moment.

188
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,240
No ring?

189
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,720
We're still looking for one.

190
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,040
And you arrived with no luggage,
if I'm not mistaken.

191
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,880
Couldn't wait to get away
from the city.

192
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,680
Yes, I could see why your betrothed

193
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,040
would want to get you to himself
as quickly as possible.

194
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,160
- You have a beautiful face.
- Oh, thank you.

195
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,480
- I moisturize.
- It's not like my face.

196
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,320
No one remembers my face.

197
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,400
You know, you could, look into
getting a rebranding specialist.

198
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,840
I'm afraid your case is worse
than I thought.

199
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,240
I must insist we return to my room
for a more thorough examination.

200
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,200
Oh, my gosh. Look at that.
No more cough!

201
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,040
You're a real miracle worker, Doc.

202
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,680
You should just stay here, relax,
have a drink. And I'm gonna...

203
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,400
Okay, bye-bye.

204
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,160
John?

205
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,600
John!

206
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,840
It seems we did end up
in my room, after all.

207
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,360
Shall we begin the examination?

208
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,600
John, you killed him!

209
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,160
'Course I did.
He's Jack the bloody Ripper!

210
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,720
Behind you!

211
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,080
Blimey!

212
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,920
Old leather apron here
must be an Encore.

213
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,800
Hand me some rope now,
will you, love?

214
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,280
Cheers.

215
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,640
<i>Captain Lance is experiencing
unusual activity in the striatum,</i>

216

219
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,760
but also managed to put Sara
in a coma.

220
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,040
I don't think the team's gonna
survive

221
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,640
another run-in
with your sister, Charlie.

222
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,000
If we had it my way,
we never would've run

223
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,280
into her in the first place.

227
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,160
Hey.

228
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,080
You got this, Captain.

229
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,600
Right.

230
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,880
"Captain."

231
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,000
All the Encores are moving
through time.

232
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,640
More specifically, they're all
heading towards a particular point.

233
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,240
Looks like they're hunting
something.

234
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,400
Or someone.

235
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,120
Astra must have sent
the Encores after John.

236
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,160
Gideon, pinpoint
where and when they're converging.

237
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,200
See, guys? I knew all my time spent

238
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,920
creating the Prognosticator
would be worth it.

239
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,280
- Ava Sharpe saves the day again!
<i>- I'm sorry, Captain.</i>

240
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,200
<i>It appears that
the Prognosticator is not equipped</i>

241
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,080
<i>to handle time-traveling Encores.</i>

242
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,880
Ava, take a deep breath.

243
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,520
You know what, we don't even know
if Sara's gonna wake up.

244
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,840
And if she does, she's going
to find out

245
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,960
that two of the Legends are missing.

246
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,720
- This is beyond unacceptable.
- Let's just sit down.

247
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,840
I'll bring you a cup
of your favorite herbal tea...

248
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,440
I'm not just gonna sit around
and do nothing.

249
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,880
If we can't track the Encores,

250
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,080
we have to go after them
at the source... Astra.

251
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,440
I seriously doubt
she's just gonna agree

252
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,640
to stop doing whatever
her current evil plan is.

253
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,200
That's why I'm not going
to give her a choice.

254
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,360
Nighty- night, Jackie- boy.

255
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,400
Sweet dreams of disembowelment
and all that jazz.

256
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,840
What the hell, John?

257
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,360
Astra must have sent him here
after me.

258
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,480
You know, not everything
is about you.

259
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,440
Well, it'd be a big,
bloody coincidence

260
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,840
if an Encore just happened to show up

261
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,760
in the same time and place
as us for no apparent reason.

262
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,960
Okay, fine. But I thought
you and Astra had a deal.

263
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,000
Clearly, she got impatient, alright?

264
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,880
Yeah, I know the feeling.
Did you find the ring?

265
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,440
It wasn't in his room. Now something
is interfering with my magic.

266
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,440
Yeah, some great sorcerer...

267
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,520
Oh, some great influencer.

268
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,560
You could barely keep him
distracted for ten minutes.

269
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,600
Oh, I'm sorry, should I have
let myself be serial killed,

270
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,280
so, you would've had five more
minutes to not find the ring?

271
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,760
You know what, we should split up,
so we can both find this in peace.

272
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,120
Fine by me, sweetheart.

273
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,960
Howdy, ma'am. My name's Clyde Barrow.

274
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,160
And my name's Bonnie.

275
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,200
And we're in need
of some accommodations.

276
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,640
Bloody hell. They're all Encores.

277
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,280
All right. While I'm down there,

278
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,040
you two need to work on
fixing the Prognosticator,

279
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,600
so we can track down Zari and John.

280
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,320
- Well, tech is not really...
- Charlie!

281
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,720
Sure. We'll figure it out.

282
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,800
I feel like somebody has to ask you.

283
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,840
Are you 100 percent certain
you want Gary to take you to Hell?

284
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,160
I was kinda wondering the same thing.

285
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,920
Look, Gary is the only wizard
I have access to.

286
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,520
And besides, I'm not only
taking Gary down there.

287
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,120
I'm gonna need some extra muscle,
too.

288
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,280
Well, thank you for noticing
the extra reps

289
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,840
I've been putting on the lat machine.

290
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,320
You ready, Mick?

291
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,600
Mick, I thought you were taking some
time off to hang out with the kid.

292
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,720
She told me to go to Hell.
Where are we headed?

293
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,680
The portal to Hell is ready, Captain.
All that's left is for...

294
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,400
me to drink some of this demon blood.

295
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,120
- Come on, Gary.
- Yeah.

296
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,080
- It's actually quite tangy.
- Okay. How do we do this?

297
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,120
I will say some words, and then
the sigil will transport us to Hell

298
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,720
for precisely four hours.

299
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,960
After that, we'll be transported
right back here.

300
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,080
Sounds good to me.

301
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,760
Enter.

302
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,760
"Flesh become my flesh.

303
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,440
Soul become my soul.

304
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,400
Hades, firstborn of Cronus
and Rhea...

305
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,920
I call upon you."

306
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,800
All right, Mick,
get ready to light it up.

307
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,160
- Beer?
- Yeah.

308
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,240
This was a terrible idea.

309
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,480
Should have worn
shoulder pads to blend in.

310
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,160
I like it. There's fire.

311
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,680
Let's just find Astra.

312
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,240
About time we killed the bitch.

313
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,200
No! John has been working so hard
to rehabilitate her.

314
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,640
Also, I thought we didn't use
that word anymore.

315
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,240
You know what, I'm gonna
let the B-word slide this time.

316
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,760
She sent a bunch of criminals
after our friends.

317
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,520
How do we even find her?
What are we supposed to do,

318
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,520
just ask a random demon
off the streets?

319
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,680
- Where's Astra?
- She's at her club.

320
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,440
It's two streets down, make a left.

321
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,400
Wow. I didn't expect that to work.
Thanks, Micky!

322
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,320
Oh, it's times like this that
I wish I hadn't given up smoking.

323
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,880
Yeah, well, I wish I had brought
my own hairbrush.

324
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,080
Guess we're both out of luck.

325
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,040
Why would Astra send
so many Encores after me?

326
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,400
I mean... seems like overkill.

327
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,080
Again, maybe it's not all about you.

328
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,360
What if they're after the ring?

329
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,280
You know, I never told Astra
about the Loom of Fate,

330
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,800
but you might be onto something.

331
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,320
Oh, look at that. Suppertime!

332
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:14,640
You're not seriously suggesting
we go dine with Hell-people?

333
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,680
I'm seriously suggesting that
you stay here, while I handle it.

334
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,160
I'm part of this, and possess
far superior social skills.

335
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,440
Yeah. Well, you bottled it
when Jack the Ripper attacked.

336
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,960
Look, I can't look after you

337
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,080
and figure out what Astra's up to
at the same time.

338
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,440
This might be Behrad's totem,

339
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,680
but there is a little warrior me
inside here

340
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,880
from a different timeline,
and she's gonna protect me.

341
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,440
I don't even know
what to say to that.

342
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,800
But I will say this.

343
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,160
Even if I have to tie you up myself,
you're staying here.

344
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,200
What are you doing?

345
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,920
Well, I can't exactly go out there
as John Constantine now, can I?

346
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,400
I think I have an idea.

347
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,720
Clyde and I were tortured
by Manaxos the Mutilator himself.

348
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,960
Your pain was a mere trifle compared
to what the Norfulthing did to me.

349
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:11,040
And I thought the Hellhounds were
the worst evil a man could suffer.

350
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,840
Who exactly are you that you were
worth Norfulthing's time?

351
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:18,640
I am, of course, King Henry VIII,
ruler of the British Empire.

352
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,760
And what crime sent you to Hell?

353
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,840
- We rob banks.
- And I plunder boats.

354
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,520
You may have heard of me.

355
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,480
The name's Black Caesar.

356
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,760
Caesar?

357
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,800
And you must be Brutus.

358
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,720
I always favored beheadings
over stabbing someone in the back.

359
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,000
Less cowardly.

360
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,960
Supper is ready!

361
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,800
Now, stop dilly-dallying
and come and have a seat,

362
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,200
before the food gets cold.

363
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,280
Excuse me, Miss Astra?

364
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,440
I found this scum
lurking by the entrance.

365
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,400
"Lurking" seems like an overly
sinister way to describe...

366
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,880
Why are you here, twerp?

367
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,600
John Constantine is outside.

368
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,040
He knows you're impatient with him,
but he has the thing he promised you.

369
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,800
But he doesn't want to come in here
and risk being seen.

370
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,200
So, if you could take a quick break

371
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,400
from eating bugs, and come with me...

372
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,800
Waste my time,
and I'll let my demonic friends here

373
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,040
use you as a human piñata.

374
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,920
So, that's where Genghis Khan's
sword went.

375
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,200
It's over, Astra.

376
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,640
We know you sent your Encores
after John, so, don't play coy.

377
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,880
What the hell's an Encore?

378
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,480
It's what we've been calling
the corrupted souls

379
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,200
that you've been sending
back to Earth.

380
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,760
I haven't sent a single "Encore" back
to Earth since John and I last spoke.

381
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,760
- Kill her already.
- Good idea.

382
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,840
Wait, Ava!

383
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,760
What if she's telling the truth?

384
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,720
Come inside and I'll prove it to you.

385
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,560
Just in time.

386
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,080
Oh, I love a good carving.

387
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,960
And who the devil
are you supposed to be?

388
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,160
I, my friend, am Jack the Ripper.

389
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,000
You've got quite the reputation,
Jack.

390
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,640
- Join us.
- Cheers, mate.

391
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,560
My mistake, sugar.

392
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,560
I would have noticed if the ring
was sitting directly in front of me.

393
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
So, we are all here for the ring.

394
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,320
I don't share me treasure
with anyone but me crew.

395
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,040
We've been set up.

396
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,600
I assume that we all have
the same deal, yeah?

397
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,240
The ring in exchange
for free reign on Earth.

398
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,200
It would appear,
we're in direct competition.

399
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,960
So, then what the hell are we doing
eating dinner?

400
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,920
Oh, that's a bit on the nose,
isn't it, Bruty?

401
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,200
Just so we're all on the same
page here,

402
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,320
each one of us has a Hell weapon,

403
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,640
and we could well and truly
end each other right here, right now.

404
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,240
Clyde, the way I see it,
this here Jack the Ripper,

405
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,560
is our greatest competition.

406
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,320
Yeah, I think you're right, peaches.

407
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,920
Jack here never was
caught by the police.

408
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,400
Greetings, subjects.

409
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:22,480
I am your Queen, Cleopatra.

410
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,960
Yes, I see.

411
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,880
They're very big and impressive.

412
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,560
That's not what I came here for.

413
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,240
Great, you all have scary weapons.
Now that we know that,

414
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,640
is it really necessary for everyone
to get cramps in their arms?

415
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,920
You, of course, remember Brutus?

416
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,640
Yes, of course.

417
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,840
"It was not that I loved Caesar less,

418
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,520
but that I loved Rome more."

419
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,440
We never had
the chance of meeting before.

420
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,320
But I would have thought my murder
of your lover would be unforgivable.

421
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,600
Damn skippy. Kill him!

422
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,480
I'm not a petty despot
ruled by past grievances.

423
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,840
I'm a strategist.

424
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,520
The most sensible thing to do...

425
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,600
is to work together.

426
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,680
As soon as one of us finds the ring,

427
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,040
it's off to the pits for the rest.

428
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,080
You're just gonna accept that?

429
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:25,280
As soon as we have the ring
in our hands, we have all the power.

430
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,760
We can march right into Hell
and demand our freedom!

431
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,800
Hey! Hear, hear to that, eh?

432
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,960
All right.

433
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,800
Now, let's eat. Okay?

434
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,080
Okay.

435
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,880
So, where's the lughead?

436
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,080
Rory is guarding our exit,
and he's enjoying some entertainment.

437
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,160
Yeah, I'll definitely be seeing
that one again down here.

438
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,200
Oh, you're no fun.

439
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,320
Now, this is where I keep
all my soul coins.

440
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,320
And as you can see,
they're all right...

441
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,760
Did you lose something?

442
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,840
No one with an "executive privacy"
button has good intentions.

443
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,160
My vault is empty.

444
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,320
Besides me, you're the only one
with access, Tiberius.

445
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,920
- Care to explain?
- Is this one of those human pranks?

446
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,080
You had me take them out
for you last week.

447
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,280
Like hell I did.

448
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,760
I swear it, I saw you myself.

449
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,640
A shapeshifter. Damn it!

450
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,440
Oh, don't look at me like that.
He'll be fine in a few hours.

451
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,160
Better, even, 'cause he'll have
learned to be less gullible.

452
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,160
At least the most valuable
one is still...

453
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,080
Who the hell is Vandal Savage?

454
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,480
Oh, I actually know that one.
He's...

455
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,600
Shut up!

456
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,600
I can't believe she did this to me.

457
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,400
Wait. You know who stole your coins?

458
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,280
Yeah.

459
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,440
But she is...

460
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,280
too powerful for me to take on.

461
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,120
Okay. What if you had backup,
you know?

462
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,760
"Enemy of my enemy" sort of thing.

463
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,440
Fine.

464
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,440
But this will require stealth.

465
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,320
Wakey-wakey.

466
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,760
The boy stay here.

467
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,120
Now, that was influencing.

468
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,920
You really think
there's a saint's chance in Hell

469
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,120
that your truce is gonna hold?

470
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,280
May I remind you
that one of them is ruddy Brutus!

471
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,400
Sorry, was that some weird
British-y way of saying

472
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,200
"Thank you for saving my life, Zari"?

473
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,360
Yeah, okay. All right.
I was in a bit of a pickle.

474
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,800
I admit it,
but may I suggest that we use

475
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,280
the few minutes that you bought us

476
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,680
to go and look for the ring?

477
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,560
Sorry about this, hon.

478
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,760
Please, don't.

479
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,160
Don't be scared.

480
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,680
"The evil that men do lives
after them," and all that.

481
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,760
So, who's this being
we're going to see?

482
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,800
The woman
who found me terrified and alone

483
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,720
when John left me to rot down here.

484
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,280
She took me in, raised me,
taught me how to make it in Hell.

485
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,320
Wow. And now she's betrayed you.

486
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,360
She was the one person
I thought I could trust.

487
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,120
Everything I am, I owe to her.

488
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,640
You know, I don't know if that is
some sob story or what, Astra,

489
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,120
but I know how you feel.

490
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,280
- Really?
- Yeah.

491
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,640
I think it's a pretty specific story.

492
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,400
Yeah, well, I had a mentor once.
The guy's name was Rip.

493
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,120
I trusted him with my life
until I found out

494
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,440
that he fabricated all my memories
to make me good at my job.

495
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,480
That's awful. So what did you do
when you found out, did you kill him?

496
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,480
I wanted to so bad.

497
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,320
But, you know,
the one thing that I learned is...

498
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,440
the only way to keep going
is to take control of your life.

499
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,000
Stop letting everybody act like
they know what's best for you

500
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,560
and make your own choices, you know?

501
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,640
What the...

502
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,040
So, it was a sob story, after all.

503
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,400
No, it was the truth.
Thanks for the therapy session.

504
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,880
Don't have too much fun
without me, boys.

505
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,080
I'll be back soon.

506
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,600
Show me the treasure I seek!

507
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,480
That compass must have
some sort of Hell powers.

508
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,960
He's using it to track the ring.

509
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,760
Okay, then we need to get
the compass.

510
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,440
- All right. I'll grab it.
- Hey. I'm going with you.

511
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,920
All right. Follow me.

512
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,920
Hey.

513
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,600
Well, that was
bloody convenient, wasn't it?

514
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,680
Yeah.

515
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,080
I tried to fight them.
Just like Rory.

516
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,400
You folded like
a cheap deck of cards, you bum.

517
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,680
Easy.

518
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,560
It's okay, Gary.
I totally got played by Astra.

519
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,080
On the bright side, there's not much
time left on the sigil.

520
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,960
We'll pop back
to the Waverider soon enough.

521
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,000
About that...
I'm the one who cast the spell.

522
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,400
So, I'll pop back to the Waverider<i>,</i>
along with anyone who's touching me

523
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,760
when the time runs out.

524
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,760
Sorry.

525
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,560
Didn't I mention that?

526
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,640
- No!
- No!

527
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,120
Listen, you dweeb.
I gotta get out of here.

528
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,200
I got a thing.

529
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,720
What thing?

530
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,240
Lita has a soccer match.

531
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,440
She didn't invite me,
but I'm inviting myself.

532
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,760
Sorry, Rory.

533
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,480
And I refuse to die here
without getting to know my daughter.

534
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,760
Do we understand each other?

535
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,720
- What position does she play?
- Gary.

536
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,680
Hold on,
we were here just a minute ago.

537
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,320
John, we are going in circles.

538
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:09,160
Yeah, it seems like it's not just
my magic that's wonky in this place.

539
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,520
Magic or no, there's so many people
looking for this ring,

540
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,120
it should've turned up by now.

541
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,280
It's like
it doesn't want to be found.

542
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,920
Hold on a minute,
you might be onto something.

543
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,280
"Sometimes you just have
to stop looking," right?

544
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,520
Why would we stop looking?

545
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,000
Because I'm beginning to suspect

546
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,800
that the spell on the ring
is of a particular breed.

547
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,680
So, if you want to find the ring...

548
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,520
you can't find it.

549
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,600
You've gotta hand it to Enchantress,
she is a crafty one.

550
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,920
Okay, it's not just gonna
slip our minds. So, what do we do?

551
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,560
We drink.

552
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,640
I know what you did, Lachesis.

553
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,360
- Who's she?
- Astra, my dear,

554
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:04,000
I'd like you to meet my sister,
Atropos.

555
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,120
I've wanted you two to meet
for quite some time now.

556
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,480
Your sister?

557
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,800
We've worn many faces
in our long lives,

558
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,560
but we are family.

559
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:16,000
Anything you need to say to me,
you can say in front of her.

560
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,600
I know you stole my soul coins.

561
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,240
Of course I did. I had to.

562
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,800
Astra, they were becoming
a distraction.

563
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,480
You'd amassed all this power
for what? Parties?

564
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,120
Gambling?

565
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:34,280
- You need to think in grander terms.
- Much grander.

566
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,800
You see, Astra, my sister and I...

567
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,800
are two of the three Fates.

568
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,040
The Loom of Fate belongs to us.

569
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,480
It is our birthright.

570
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:49,880
- Why... why didn't you tell me?
- You weren't ready.

571
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,560
Oh, Astra, making soul coins

572
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:57,280
and using them to control
the denizens of Hell

573
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,040
was a cheap reflection
of my former glory.

574
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,960
Now, that the Loom of Fate
is within reach...

575
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,480
I want you to become one of us.

576
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,440
Become our third sister.

577
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,480
You'd have the power of a god.

578
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:16,240
Astra, this is what
I have been preparing you for

579
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,200
ever since I took you in
as a young girl.

580
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,680
But what about my mom?

581
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,440
John had promised that
he'd use the Loom of Fate

582
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,720
to make it so she never died.

583
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:29,760
Astra, you need to move beyond
these petty human desires!

584
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:34,640
I am offering you the power
to design destiny.

585
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,680
You once sought to rule over Hell...

586
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,160
Now, you can rule over
the whole cosmos.

587
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,520
Will you join us?

588
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,640
What do you say, girl?

589
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,920
Trust me, Astra.
I know what's best for you.

590
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,480
Sister always knows best.

591
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,640
Of course, I'll join you.

592
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,880
How could I ever turn down
so much power?

593
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,280
- Good girl.
- There's just one thing.

594
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,720
John Constantine's coin.

595
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,960
He's mine to toy with.

596
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,800
Seems like a fair trade.

597
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,120
- I took care of Brutus.
-And I got our pirate friend, Caesar.

598
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,840
Any luck with the ring?

599
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,520
Damn thing might as well
be invisible.

600
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,640
Well, Bonnie, guess we got no choice
but to make the rest

601
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,160
of our fellow guests disappear.

602
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,280
Now, what do we have here?

603
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,960
Another Hell-ian to kill?

604
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,240
Lucky us.

605
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,680
- I'm Jack the Ripper.
- Nice try.

606
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,000
- We already met Jack.
- That Jack's an imposter. Worse...

607
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,680
It's John Constantine.

608
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,240
That liar!

609
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,640
He must be here to send us
back to Hell.

610
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,520
Now, don't lose your temper, Bonnie.

611
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,880
We'll teach that grifter
a lesson, okay?

612
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,160
Good old Mrs. Hughes.

613
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,920
Okay, I'm not thinking
about the ring.

614
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,560
I'm not thinking about the ring.

615
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,080
Yeah, that's not gonna work.

616
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,400
So, you're just gonna accept failure
when we are this close?

617
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,920
I'm not giving up.

618
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,280
Oh, I don't see it as giving up,
so much as...

619
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,800
accepting reality.

620
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,240
I know myself.

621
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:42,320
I'm a ripe old mix of guilt
and torment.

622
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,480
If the Loom of Fate offers me
even one glimmer of hope

623
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,600
of redemption for all my past sins...

624
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,600
particularly Astra, then...

625
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,800
I'll never not be thinking about it.

626
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,000
You know, it's funny,
I'm usually an expert

627
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,200
at getting things out of my head.

628
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,720
Boyfriend cheating on me
with my assistant-slash-best friend?

629
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:09,640
No time to cry,
I have a fall fashion line to plan.

630
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,560
Overhearing my mother tell a friend
she's embarrassed

631
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,000
her daughter is so shallow
and self-absorbed?

632
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:20,560
Definitely can't process that,
I will check my Cat-Chat analytics.

633
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,960
But my baby brother dying
because he was trying to protect me?

634
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,960
There is nothing that can get that
out of my head.

635
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,440
I was wearing the totem when he died.

636
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,960
If I hadn't been, maybe he...

637
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,320
Maybe he would have had a chance.

638
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,600
Look, you can take it
from an expert...

639
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:06,000
Nothing good ever comes
from beating yourself up, love.

640
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,680
Don't try to make me feel better.

641
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,080
John.

642
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,440
What if we don't find the ring?

643
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,680
What if I never get him back?

644
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,320
Yoo-hoo!

645
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:24,920
- John friggin' Constantine!
- We know who you are,

646
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,680
and there's someone here
you'll be just dying to meet.

647
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,000
They do say imitation
is the sincerest form of flattery.

648
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,040
This passage leads outside.
I'll distract them while you escape.

649
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,280
- No, come with me.
- Go.

650
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:44,480
This is my house and I'm just crazy
enough to defend it.

651
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,640
And listen...
you can get Behrad back, Zari.

652
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,000
I truly believe that. But unless
you get out of here right now,

653
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,640
then neither of you stand a chance.

654
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,880
Okay.

655
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,160
Ava, I'd just like to say,
you're the best boss I've ever had.

656
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,400
Well, the only boss I've ever had.

657
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,400
I'm more apprentice
than employee with John.

658
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,840
And before the Bureau, well...

659
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,680
Finally, you've come to kill us.

660
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,320
About time. I was getting bored!

661
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,240
Get out of here.

662
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,920
Astra, what made you change
your mind?

663
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,600
You're helping John
find the Loom for me.

664
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,680
Might as well let you.

665
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,160
Either he'll come through,
or Lachesis is bound to.

666
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,520
Did you say "Lachesis"? The Fate?

667
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,080
- Wait, how do you know who...
- It's a small underworld after all.

668
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,840
- Time's almost up!
- Come with us.

669
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,360
- What?
- What?

670
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,960
Astra, it's time
for you to take control.

671
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,200
Don't wait for them.

672
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,200
You can help us find the Loom
and save your mother yourself.

673
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,280
Ten seconds left!

674
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,760
The choice is yours.

675
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,040
Wait, did she ever channel an animal
while you were, you know...

676
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,480
She did once. But it was...

677
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,480
- Is that...
- Meet Astra.

678
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,960
Why does she have the sword?

679
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,480
There's no time to explain.
We got to move.

680
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,880
Where's the ring, John?

681
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,720
I don't know where the ring is.

682
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,120
And even if I did,
I wouldn't tell you muppets.

683
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,440
John. John, be reasonable.

684
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,560
We are going to kill you, regardless.

685
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,800
But it's up to you
how painful that death has to be.

686
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,800
You'd be surprised how long
you can stay alive without...

687
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,040
certain organs.

688
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,800
You want your coat back, don't ya?

689
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,840
You can all go to Hell!

690
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,520
Stop!

691
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,320
Cleopatra?

692
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,120
Yes.

693
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,960
I order you to stop.

694
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,640
You don't have
that kind of power here, honey.

695
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,680
Are you both serious? She's with him!

696
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,120
Is that so?

697
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,520
Maybe this will make you talk.

698
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,440
I don't know where the ring is,
all right?

699
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,960
Funny, I believe you. What a shame.

700
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,840
Cheer up, darling.
We can kill him now.

701
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,840
No!

702
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,200
You come back...

703
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,880
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

704
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,440
Blimey.

705
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,600
What?

706
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,440
The bloody ring.

707
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,960
Must have been here
the whole time.

708
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,320
I guess I stopped thinking about it.

709
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,360
Guys! We're here to save you!

710
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
But...

711
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,320
it looks like you took care of that
on your own.

712
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,160
Thank God. Please tell me
that you found the ring?

713
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,680
We did. Thanks to Zari.

714
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,320
Fantastic.

715
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,520
Good...

716
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,480
Wait a second.
Are those Hell weapons?

717
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,040
- Yeah.
- We could use those, especially...

718
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,560
Yeah, let's just get them
and get out of here.

719
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,680
Good morning!

720
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,960
Are those even more guests?

721
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,400
No. So sorry, ma'am,
we were just leaving.

722
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,080
And...

723
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:59,000
here's me thinking you weren't
allowed to meddle anymore.

724
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,680
You could've been a
touch more direct.

725
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,680
I'm sure I don't know what you mean.

726
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,920
Yeah. Right.

727
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,360
See you around, John Constantine.

728
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,720
So, you got the totem to work?

729
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,760
Yeah, I did. It was amazing.

730
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,640
Terrifying, but amazing.

731
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,400
And I sort of felt like
Behrad was there with me.

732
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:32,080
He'd be so proud of you.
I'm so proud of you. Congratulations.

733
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,200
John! You're safe!

734
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,440
All right, Gary. Oh! Okay, all right.
Calm down, all right?

735
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,240
I'm happy to see you, too, mate.
Hey, how's Sara doing?

736
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,320
Oh, she's still unconscious.
Charlie is sitting with her now.

737
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:47,000
I'm gonna try to distract myself
by fixing the Prognosticator.

738
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,960
Technical skills aren't
Charlie and I's strong suit.

739
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,080
- I know.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on a tick.

740
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,080
If that contraption is broke,
how the hell did you find us?

741
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,840
About that...

742
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,400
Hey, John.

743
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:02,240
I hear we have a Loom to build.
