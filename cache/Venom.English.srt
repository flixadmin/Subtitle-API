There are good people
in this world, a lot of them.

And then there are bad people.

1640
01:29:51,178 --> 01:29:52,721
You have to tell
the difference.

1641
01:29:52,846 --> 01:29:56,641

you will only ever
be allowed to touch,

harm, hurt, possibly,
very possibly,

1643
01:30:00,187 --> 01:30:02,522
eat very, very bad people,

1644
01:30:02,647 --> 01:30:05,108
but never, ever,
ever good people. All right?

1645

VENOM: Fine.
Good.

1646
01:30:07,903 --> 01:30:09,571

tell the difference?
