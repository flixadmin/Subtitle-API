1
00:00:01,593 --> 00:00:04,123
I've been tasked with
assembling an elite team.

2
00:00:04,158 --> 00:00:07,237
Of all the people who ever
lived, I chose you eight.

3
00:00:07,272 --> 00:00:08,547
The scope of "Legends of Tomorrow"

4
00:00:08,582 --> 00:00:10,688
is about as big as any I've ever worked on.

5
00:00:10,723 --> 00:00:11,963
And you are?

6
00:00:11,998 --> 00:00:13,524
Rip Hunter.

7
00:00:13,741 --> 00:00:15,676
I'm from the future.

8
00:00:16,327 --> 00:00:17,221
It is a battle...

9
00:00:17,256 --> 00:00:20,655
I've seen Men of Steel
die and Dark Knights fall.

10
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,136
...that spans the ages.

11
00:00:22,225 --> 00:00:25,280
The biggest challenge that the
team is gonna face is time itself.

12
00:00:25,334 --> 00:00:26,728
An immortal madman...

13
00:00:26,786 --> 00:00:28,345
Vandal Savage...

14
00:00:28,402 --> 00:00:31,333
an evil dictator blessed with immortality.

15
00:00:31,368 --> 00:00:33,324
...versus a band of misfits.

16
00:00:34,218 --> 00:00:37,344
Our team definitely has
their work cut out for them.

17
00:00:37,648 --> 00:00:39,306
In a race through time...

18
00:00:39,341 --> 00:00:41,952
<i>Course plotted for 1975.</i>

19
00:00:42,026 --> 00:00:45,353
...to save the world.

20
00:00:47,128 --> 00:00:49,752
Now, the minds behind
an all-new adventure...

21
00:00:49,786 --> 00:00:51,132
It's very cool.

22
00:00:51,167 --> 00:00:53,806
It's like nothing that's ever been on TV.

23
00:00:53,841 --> 00:00:55,375
This is gonna get a little rough.

24
00:00:55,448 --> 00:00:57,412
...bring you the heroes...

25
00:00:57,447 --> 00:01:00,136
We have the power to change the world.

26
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,129
...and villains...

27
00:01:01,164 --> 00:01:03,518
Let's get this party started!

28
00:01:03,754 --> 00:01:07,379
...of past, present, and future...

29
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,345
I like being part of a team, man.

30
00:01:09,426 --> 00:01:10,593
Me too.

31
00:01:10,835 --> 00:01:12,104
...who will become...

32
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:14,374
We've lived in the shadows long enough.

33
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:16,064
Be a hero in the light.

34
00:01:16,142 --> 00:01:16,923
...the Legends...

35
00:01:16,958 --> 00:01:18,242
Let's do this.

36
00:01:18,386 --> 00:01:20,073
...of Tomorrow.

37
00:01:22,843 --> 00:01:24,557
I could get behind that.

38
00:01:25,059 --> 00:01:30,059

39
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:36,346
For generations,

40
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:40,163
audiences have been captivated
by the power of superheroes.

41
00:01:40,198 --> 00:01:42,081
People are looking for heroes.

42
00:01:42,116 --> 00:01:43,559
They're looking for people who care about

43
00:01:43,594 --> 00:01:45,100
making the world a better place.

44
00:01:45,196 --> 00:01:46,756
If they're not finding it in reality,

45
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:49,050
they're finding it in
these comic-book characters.

46
00:01:49,085 --> 00:01:50,827
You give the people of this city hope.

47
00:01:50,862 --> 00:01:52,492
There's a great quote about Batman.

48
00:01:52,527 --> 00:01:54,562
The dream of being Batman
is to look in the dark

49
00:01:54,628 --> 00:01:55,585
and not be afraid,

50
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:58,151
because everything else in
the dark is more afraid of you.

51
00:02:00,401 --> 00:02:02,078
That's such a powerful statement that,

52
00:02:02,113 --> 00:02:04,260
what if we did have the
power to stand up to the dark?

53
00:02:04,294 --> 00:02:06,392
That's not the kind of hero you are.

54
00:02:06,427 --> 00:02:08,646
Trying to find strength in whatever

55
00:02:08,704 --> 00:02:11,921
you perceive to be the
things that make you weak.

56
00:02:11,991 --> 00:02:14,415
You know the difference
between right and wrong.

57
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:17,398
That's at the core of
all superhero stories.

58
00:02:17,433 --> 00:02:19,609
I believe you were meant to be a hero.

59
00:02:19,643 --> 00:02:21,526
If you look where we are in the world,

60
00:02:21,604 --> 00:02:22,767
it's very unpredictable,

61
00:02:22,802 --> 00:02:24,957
but it's also, I think, gotten
a lot scarier for people.

62
00:02:24,992 --> 00:02:28,817
And I think there's a craving
for the idea of a hero.

63
00:02:28,852 --> 00:02:29,602
Jax?

64
00:02:29,652 --> 00:02:31,953
For someone to come in and save us.

65
00:02:31,988 --> 00:02:33,589
They really are gods, in a way.

66
00:02:33,623 --> 00:02:35,006
Even without me,

67
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:37,147
Starling still has heroes to watch over it.

68
00:02:37,213 --> 00:02:38,883
But their gods that are relatable to us

69
00:02:38,918 --> 00:02:40,455
because they also have a human side.

70
00:02:40,526 --> 00:02:42,704
- I'm no superhero.
- You're a hero.

71
00:02:42,739 --> 00:02:45,371
For three years, you have
been the person I can count on.

72
00:02:45,406 --> 00:02:46,740
Every one of us in our lives

73
00:02:46,775 --> 00:02:49,636
wishes we had the ability
to make things better,

74
00:02:49,671 --> 00:02:50,669
you know, whether it's for the world

75
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:52,365
or just even for ourselves.

76
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,871
I've actually met the Flash.

77
00:02:53,906 --> 00:02:55,605
What's he like? Is he cool?

78
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,646
He's one of the best guys that I know.

79
00:02:57,681 --> 00:03:00,865
What makes superheroes so
powerful in this moment,

80
00:03:00,917 --> 00:03:02,772
in the big fight of good versus evil,

81
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:04,419
ultimately, good wins.

82
00:03:04,514 --> 00:03:06,030
The good guys win.

83
00:03:08,173 --> 00:03:11,441
Let's work on some softer
gloves for next time, okay?

84
00:03:13,341 --> 00:03:16,249
From that world comes
"Legends of Tomorrow,"

85
00:03:16,284 --> 00:03:18,370
a team of heroes and villains

86
00:03:18,436 --> 00:03:21,395
who have come together to save humanity.

87
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:24,235
They're being recruited by a
time traveler from the future...

88
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,222
Rip Hunter. I'm from East London.

89
00:03:27,287 --> 00:03:28,370
...who has come back in time

90
00:03:28,451 --> 00:03:30,714
to recruit a group of very specific people.

91
00:03:30,749 --> 00:03:32,463
I know it's difficult for you to fathom,

92
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,990
but in the future, none of you are heroes.

93
00:03:35,025 --> 00:03:38,508
What makes our show unique
is that it's a motley crew.

94
00:03:38,543 --> 00:03:39,737
You're Legends.

95
00:03:39,818 --> 00:03:42,458
It's up to them to find the
hero inside of themselves,

96
00:03:42,524 --> 00:03:45,591
to stand up and fight to save the world.

97
00:03:47,171 --> 00:03:48,971
We got ourselves a stowaway.

98
00:03:49,071 --> 00:03:50,057
Their mission...

99
00:03:50,092 --> 00:03:52,427
to defeat an unstoppable force.

100
00:03:52,462 --> 00:03:54,799
I've waited a long time for this hunt.

101
00:03:54,841 --> 00:03:56,432
Vandal Savage is an immortal

102
00:03:56,467 --> 00:03:58,669
who's walked our earth for centuries.

103
00:04:01,287 --> 00:04:02,614
The cool thing about Vandal Savage is,

104
00:04:02,649 --> 00:04:04,769
over time, he's acquired different skills.

105
00:04:06,549 --> 00:04:09,730
You can imagine the worst,
most evil possible person

106
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,550
in the world living forever,

107
00:04:11,601 --> 00:04:13,929
and all the things that they've learned.

108
00:04:15,533 --> 00:04:17,381
He's a very substantial bad guy.

109
00:04:18,695 --> 00:04:20,062
He's been trained by

110
00:04:20,124 --> 00:04:22,597
the likes of Houdini and Genghis Khan.

111
00:04:22,632 --> 00:04:23,490
Where did he go?

112
00:04:23,525 --> 00:04:24,736
He's kind of an urban myth.

113
00:04:24,817 --> 00:04:27,512
<i>He's an immortal Egyptian priest,</i>

114
00:04:27,578 --> 00:04:30,512
<i>and he will be the
death of the world.</i>

115
00:04:31,276 --> 00:04:32,666
_

116
00:04:32,701 --> 00:04:35,494
We have warned you time
and again of the sky rocks.

117
00:04:35,577 --> 00:04:37,846
Dark times are coming, my pharaoh.

118
00:04:37,881 --> 00:04:40,609
He's been working his
way to create the scenario

119
00:04:40,644 --> 00:04:42,751
where he can finally take over the world,

120
00:04:42,786 --> 00:04:45,576
and his powers are very closely tied

121
00:04:45,631 --> 00:04:47,299
to those of Hawkman and Hawkgirl.

122
00:04:47,334 --> 00:04:51,103
Hey, hey, wait. Stay a little longer.

123
00:04:51,365 --> 00:04:54,545
Vandal Savage is in
pursuit of Carter and Kendra

124
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,751
for a long-standing feud

125
00:04:55,786 --> 00:04:57,608
that he's had with them
for thousands of years.

126
00:04:57,647 --> 00:05:00,721
The clergy is forbidden
to lie with royalty.

127
00:05:00,756 --> 00:05:01,433
Get out.

128
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:05,559
The penalty for such a
transgression is death.

129
00:05:05,594 --> 00:05:08,016
The way that Vandal can
maintain his immortality

130
00:05:08,082 --> 00:05:10,576
is by killing Carter and Kendra

131
00:05:10,611 --> 00:05:12,568
in each of their various lives.

132
00:05:15,403 --> 00:05:18,869
The three of them were exposed
to the same dark matter...

133
00:05:19,622 --> 00:05:22,945
My hate will be everlasting.

134
00:05:23,018 --> 00:05:24,856
...which is what allows
Vandal to be immortal,

135
00:05:24,898 --> 00:05:26,822
and what allows Kendra and Carter

136
00:05:26,896 --> 00:05:28,783
to constantly reincarnate.

137
00:05:28,818 --> 00:05:30,510
Come back to me.

138
00:05:32,164 --> 00:05:33,679
_

139
00:05:33,714 --> 00:05:35,806
I just moved to Central City,

140
00:05:35,841 --> 00:05:38,074
and it's a pretty big change
from where I come from.

141
00:05:38,109 --> 00:05:40,071
Kendra Saunders has
only recently discovered

142
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:41,565
that she's, in fact, Hawkgirl.

143
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,082
What's interesting about Kendra

144
00:05:43,117 --> 00:05:45,376
is how little she knows about herself.

145
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:46,848
When we first meet her,

146
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:50,061
she thinks she's just a barista
who moved to the big city.

147
00:05:50,096 --> 00:05:52,627
Everything here is so big and new and...

148
00:05:52,693 --> 00:05:54,486
filled with meta-humans.

149
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:55,445
She's a little bit lost.

150
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,514
She feels like there's something missing.

151
00:05:59,763 --> 00:06:00,649
Kendra!

152
00:06:00,684 --> 00:06:02,331
She meets Carter, and she discovers

153
00:06:02,365 --> 00:06:03,741
that she's been reincarnated,

154
00:06:03,776 --> 00:06:05,300
that she was an Egyptian princess.

155
00:06:05,335 --> 00:06:09,145
Shayera, you look as beautiful as ever.

156
00:06:09,179 --> 00:06:10,450
_

157
00:06:10,508 --> 00:06:13,108
In every lifetime, they've fallen in love.

158
00:06:13,961 --> 00:06:15,283
You need to wake up.

159
00:06:15,318 --> 00:06:17,375
So when he shows up at Kendra's doorstep,

160
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,560
he's already in love with her,

161
00:06:18,618 --> 00:06:20,429
and she's, like, who the hell is this guy?

162
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:21,838
You know, I'm dating Cisco.

163
00:06:21,873 --> 00:06:23,874
- I don't think I'm...
- Ready for this.

164
00:06:23,957 --> 00:06:25,672
You say that in every lifetime.

165
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,394
Kendra Saunders and Carter Hall

166
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:28,960
are tied together, ultimately,

167
00:06:29,061 --> 00:06:30,835
because of their love for one another,

168
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,530
although, when we start our story...

169
00:06:32,565 --> 00:06:33,236
Come at me.

170
00:06:33,271 --> 00:06:35,685
...Kendra doesn't have any
of those feelings for Carter.

171
00:06:37,654 --> 00:06:39,355
One of the fun things we
get to play with on the show

172
00:06:39,421 --> 00:06:41,306
is destiny versus free will.

173
00:06:41,341 --> 00:06:42,103
Good.

174
00:06:42,206 --> 00:06:43,331
Whether she and Carter

175
00:06:43,366 --> 00:06:45,140
are meant for each other in this life

176
00:06:45,175 --> 00:06:46,642
or for the rest of eternity.

177
00:06:46,677 --> 00:06:47,877
I'm never gonna become who I really am

178
00:06:47,911 --> 00:06:49,289
unless I let go.

179
00:06:49,324 --> 00:06:51,780
She's really just sort of
embracing the power of it all.

180
00:06:51,815 --> 00:06:53,170
No!

181
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:55,151
And she's somebody with such a good heart,

182
00:06:55,185 --> 00:06:58,088
and now she has the ability
to do something about it.

183
00:07:01,433 --> 00:07:02,173
God!

184
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:04,476
She also has the power to fly...

185
00:07:04,511 --> 00:07:05,355
Whoo-hoo!

186
00:07:05,421 --> 00:07:07,456
...which is something we don't see

187
00:07:07,491 --> 00:07:09,865
a lot of other female
characters getting to do that.

188
00:07:10,016 --> 00:07:12,516
Hey.

189
00:07:12,611 --> 00:07:15,189
I'm gonna have to learn
how to use these things.

190
00:07:15,263 --> 00:07:18,564
You'll get the hang of it... Hawkgirl.

191
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:37,627
Who's that? Where'd he come from?

192
00:07:38,253 --> 00:07:40,680
The legacy of the Legends runs deep.

193
00:07:40,763 --> 00:07:42,004
When we made "Arrow,"

194
00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:44,665
it was at the beginning of comic-book TV.

195
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,090
You've failed this city.

196
00:07:47,332 --> 00:07:50,666
We wanted a crime drama
that had real roots.

197
00:07:50,701 --> 00:07:51,997
What if I'm not a hero?

198
00:07:52,032 --> 00:07:54,372
I don't think that bolt of
lightning struck you, Barry.

199
00:07:54,422 --> 00:07:55,858
I think it chose you.

200
00:07:57,075 --> 00:07:58,363
Then when we did "Flash,"

201
00:07:58,398 --> 00:08:00,674
we were entering the world of sci-fi,

202
00:08:00,734 --> 00:08:02,645
and we knew the adventures were heightened,

203
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,277
but we also wanted to add an
element of a family drama...

204
00:08:05,331 --> 00:08:06,299
- Mom!
- Barry, no!

205
00:08:06,345 --> 00:08:07,700
Run, Barry, run!

206
00:08:07,735 --> 00:08:09,642
...in terms of Flash's backstory.

207
00:08:09,702 --> 00:08:10,247
Mom?!

208
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:11,981
And now we have "Legends of Tomorrow."

209
00:08:12,016 --> 00:08:15,095
It's the first superhero mash-up on TV.

210
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:16,690
I could get behind that.

211
00:08:16,777 --> 00:08:18,217
If you do watch "Arrow" and "Flash,"

212
00:08:18,272 --> 00:08:20,765
"Legends" definitely
springs from those worlds.

213
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,450
We've lived in the shadows long enough.

214
00:08:22,511 --> 00:08:24,331
Be a hero in the light.

215
00:08:24,365 --> 00:08:26,087
But it also feels really different.

216
00:08:26,122 --> 00:08:27,485
It's almost like "Big Brother"

217
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,484
in space with superheroes.

218
00:08:29,556 --> 00:08:30,964
It's got science-fiction elements.

219
00:08:30,999 --> 00:08:32,209
It has time-travel elements.

220
00:08:32,244 --> 00:08:34,709
It's got a spaceship with
a living computer on it.

221
00:08:34,744 --> 00:08:36,637
We're just really excited
to expand the world

222
00:08:36,672 --> 00:08:38,648
and have people go on this journey.

223
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:41,033
Now it's up to you. Shall we?

224
00:08:41,168 --> 00:08:42,954
One of the fun things about the show

225
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:47,554
is the fact that we get a
chance to populate our team...

226
00:08:47,822 --> 00:08:50,216
with all these different characters.

227
00:08:52,106 --> 00:08:53,382
_

228
00:08:53,417 --> 00:08:57,048
Sara's been through a lot.
And she's really messed up.

229
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:58,160
I saw you die.

230
00:08:58,195 --> 00:08:59,788
Sara!

231
00:08:59,823 --> 00:09:00,835
Where have you been?

232
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:01,562
Everywhere.

233
00:09:01,597 --> 00:09:03,165
She's been an assassin.

234
00:09:03,884 --> 00:09:05,433
She's tried to be a hero.

235
00:09:05,468 --> 00:09:07,568
You can't save the city with forgiveness.

236
00:09:07,603 --> 00:09:08,388
Let him go.

237
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:10,609
And she really turns it around...

238
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,225
but then she's killed.

239
00:09:14,114 --> 00:09:14,699
Sara!

240
00:09:14,734 --> 00:09:16,327
Her sister loves her so dearly

241
00:09:16,377 --> 00:09:18,593
that when she hears about the Lazarus Pit,

242
00:09:18,628 --> 00:09:19,980
Laurel makes the fateful decision

243
00:09:20,051 --> 00:09:21,973
to put Sara in the Pit.

244
00:09:23,287 --> 00:09:26,239
She comes back out as a wild, feral animal.

245
00:09:29,591 --> 00:09:31,097
Her soul has been restored,

246
00:09:31,131 --> 00:09:33,805
but she still has a tinge of the bloodlust.

247
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,111
The life that she was
given comes at a cost.

248
00:09:36,146 --> 00:09:37,909
She's compelled to kill.

249
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:38,873
Sara!

250
00:09:40,557 --> 00:09:42,103
One of the things she's
gonna be dealing with

251
00:09:42,138 --> 00:09:45,367
is figuring out how to
balance that with being a hero.

252
00:09:45,402 --> 00:09:47,672
I couldn't stop myself,

253
00:09:47,707 --> 00:09:49,298
and the worst part of it was,

254
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:50,635
I felt better.

255
00:09:50,701 --> 00:09:52,636
And she's been brought along by Rip Hunter

256
00:09:52,671 --> 00:09:55,018
on this journey, she thinks, to be a hero.

257
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:56,951
But, in fact, he's much more interested

258
00:09:56,986 --> 00:09:59,231
in her assassin abilities.

259
00:10:01,865 --> 00:10:04,497
And she leaves Arrow in
search of a new mission,

260
00:10:04,591 --> 00:10:06,821
and I think, in many ways, a new family.

261
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,455
One of Sara's new partners...

262
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:09,293
Up there.

263
00:10:09,328 --> 00:10:10,680
...could not be more different.

264
00:10:10,746 --> 00:10:12,180
Is that a bird?

265
00:10:12,306 --> 00:10:13,640
It's a plane.

266
00:10:14,535 --> 00:10:16,676
Hi, I'm Ray.

267
00:10:16,993 --> 00:10:18,126
_

268
00:10:18,161 --> 00:10:20,418
Ray was always sort of
Dudley Do-Right on "Arrow."

269
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,115
He was sort of fun and vibrant...

270
00:10:22,149 --> 00:10:22,891
Traffic was terrible,

271
00:10:22,926 --> 00:10:25,078
which is why I took my helicopter.

272
00:10:25,126 --> 00:10:26,595
...and always quick-witted with a joke.

273
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:27,914
You guys validate, right?

274
00:10:27,949 --> 00:10:29,452
One of the things that's
great about his character

275
00:10:29,487 --> 00:10:32,432
is he's unfailingly optimistic.

276
00:10:32,467 --> 00:10:34,859
This city still needs saving.

277
00:10:34,894 --> 00:10:36,203
We always call him the Boy Scout.

278
00:10:36,238 --> 00:10:37,451
Ray saved the day.

279
00:10:37,486 --> 00:10:39,166
His motives are so pure.

280
00:10:39,201 --> 00:10:40,285
You need to get some sleep.

281
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,437
Once I've cracked the problem.

282
00:10:41,503 --> 00:10:42,702
Or blow yourself up.

283
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:43,730
Whichever comes first.

284
00:10:43,788 --> 00:10:46,615
He's part brilliant scientist,

285
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:49,378
part incredibly inventive inventor.

286
00:10:49,436 --> 00:10:51,142
Superpowers are based in science,

287
00:10:51,202 --> 00:10:52,815
and I am a man of science.

288
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:54,978
And he's also a superhero to boot.

289
00:10:55,059 --> 00:10:55,923
Picked a name yet?

290
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:58,272
I'm kind of partial to the Atom.

291
00:10:58,307 --> 00:10:59,779
You married to that, or...

292
00:10:59,814 --> 00:11:01,836
And he's got his own supersuit.

293
00:11:01,871 --> 00:11:04,450
Execute.

294
00:11:04,512 --> 00:11:06,510
Why can't anything ever
work at the first try?

295
00:11:09,062 --> 00:11:10,831
Ray is ostensibly killed,

296
00:11:10,889 --> 00:11:12,774
and we realize he's just been miniaturized.

297
00:11:12,834 --> 00:11:13,638
Ray is...

298
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:14,940
The size of a tater tot.

299
00:11:15,006 --> 00:11:16,378
Well, I don't know about that.

300
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:19,229
He's had the experience of
the world thinking he was dead

301
00:11:19,264 --> 00:11:21,294
and finding out that...

302
00:11:21,329 --> 00:11:23,201
the world didn't miss him that much.

303
00:11:23,236 --> 00:11:24,892
If I'm gonna come back to life,

304
00:11:24,942 --> 00:11:27,279
I have to figure out
what it is I'm living for.

305
00:11:27,406 --> 00:11:29,292
So part of his reason for joining our team

306
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,441
is wanting to leave a mark on the world.

307
00:11:31,476 --> 00:11:32,611
I got this!

308
00:11:32,646 --> 00:11:34,401
- You sure?
- Go!

309
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,534
He really idolizes Oliver

310
00:11:37,582 --> 00:11:39,458
and is enamored with the Flash.

311
00:11:39,493 --> 00:11:40,009
Cool.

312
00:11:40,044 --> 00:11:42,341
And really loves the idea of being a hero.

313
00:11:42,376 --> 00:11:44,653
So, it's a team-up? High five!

314
00:11:44,969 --> 00:11:48,618
For him, a chance to
become a hero... hell, yeah.

315
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:51,509
The chance to be a Legend... no-brainer.

316
00:11:52,394 --> 00:11:53,897
In the darkest hour...

317
00:11:53,932 --> 00:11:54,592
Get down!

318
00:11:54,627 --> 00:11:56,646
...he's the sort of guy who can say,

319
00:11:56,681 --> 00:11:57,769
"Let's look at the bright side.

320
00:11:57,804 --> 00:11:59,371
We've still got a fighting chance."

321
00:11:59,406 --> 00:12:01,448
You should see the other guy.

322
00:12:01,482 --> 00:12:04,402
It feels bigger than
both "Arrow" and "Flash."

323
00:12:04,437 --> 00:12:05,250
"The Legends of Tomorrow"

324
00:12:05,285 --> 00:12:07,615
are fighting to save all of history.

325
00:12:07,696 --> 00:12:10,307
They go to ancient Egypt, the future,

326
00:12:10,342 --> 00:12:12,258
alternative timelines.

327
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:13,398
It still has

328
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:15,935
those great moments where the
team really comes together,

329
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:17,549
and you really see the camaraderie

330
00:12:17,584 --> 00:12:19,065
and the heart and the humanity.

331
00:12:19,122 --> 00:12:22,402
If we have the power to change the world,

332
00:12:22,554 --> 00:12:25,557
don't you think we have the
power to change our own fate?

333
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,529
Mr. Allen...

334
00:12:41,564 --> 00:12:42,313
Timing...

335
00:12:42,381 --> 00:12:43,140
What can I do for you?

336
00:12:43,175 --> 00:12:43,979
...is everything.

337
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:45,638
I need to talk to you about a paper

338
00:12:45,702 --> 00:12:47,355
that you wrote 25 years ago.

339
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,345
Could you be more specific
about the subject matter?

340
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,947
Time travel.

341
00:12:52,307 --> 00:12:52,895
_

342
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:55,140
The entire show is premised on the idea

343
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:58,044
that time travel is a fraught enterprise.

344
00:12:58,107 --> 00:12:59,836
<i>Course plotted for 1975.</i>

345
00:12:59,871 --> 00:13:01,953
I suggest you all strap yourselves in.

346
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:02,679
Cool!

347
00:13:02,714 --> 00:13:05,754
A lot of the problems
that come up along the way

348
00:13:05,789 --> 00:13:07,986
are problems of their own making.

349
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:09,195
If only you'd have listened to me

350
00:13:09,257 --> 00:13:11,092
about the dangers of
upsetting the timeline!

351
00:13:11,127 --> 00:13:12,449
There are consequences,

352
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:14,734
but it's in a very sort of understandable

353
00:13:14,789 --> 00:13:16,685
"Back to the Future" sort of way.

354
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,864
This is so trippy.

355
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:19,920
Like Marty and the Polaroid trippy.

356
00:13:20,001 --> 00:13:21,425
People just want to be entertained

357
00:13:21,459 --> 00:13:23,076
and experience the fun of time travel...

358
00:13:23,111 --> 00:13:24,675
That audience is really
gonna love the show.

359
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,280
People actually wore this crap?

360
00:13:26,315 --> 00:13:29,685
You can geek out on history
in a way that allows you

361
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,401
to have an adventure at the same time.

362
00:13:31,464 --> 00:13:33,135
Would you be interested

363
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:35,475
in taking a trip into history?

364
00:13:35,808 --> 00:13:37,111
_

365
00:13:37,146 --> 00:13:38,469
We always say that Firestorm

366
00:13:38,521 --> 00:13:40,540
is The Odd Couple with super powers.

367
00:13:40,575 --> 00:13:42,307
Jefferson Jackson, right?

368
00:13:42,342 --> 00:13:43,146
People call me Jax.

369
00:13:43,183 --> 00:13:44,381
Ooh, catchy.

370
00:13:44,415 --> 00:13:45,956
Professor Stein is, shall we say,

371
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,464
the brains of the operation.

372
00:13:47,499 --> 00:13:49,862
It changed the molecular
structure of your body.

373
00:13:49,897 --> 00:13:51,421
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on, Grey.

374
00:13:51,502 --> 00:13:53,090
He pairs up with Jax,

375
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:55,525
who's a headstrong, 20-something.

376
00:13:55,588 --> 00:13:57,494
So you're saying I'm like
one of those meta-humans

377
00:13:57,552 --> 00:13:59,004
I keep hearing about on the news?

378
00:13:59,084 --> 00:14:01,231
I am. Please, call me Professor.

379
00:14:01,265 --> 00:14:05,596
Instead of being motivated
by the desire to be a hero,

380
00:14:05,631 --> 00:14:07,873
he is very much a scientist at heart.

381
00:14:07,939 --> 00:14:11,341
Professor Stein, you are a genius.

382
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:14,111
I believe that's already
been well-established.

383
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:15,269
Martin Stein is, ironically,

384
00:14:15,331 --> 00:14:17,738
kind of the more
enthusiastic one of the two.

385
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:18,557
Whoa.

386
00:14:18,592 --> 00:14:20,488
Hey, "Beautiful Mind,"

387
00:14:20,523 --> 00:14:21,882
I think you need to take a breather.

388
00:14:21,917 --> 00:14:23,172
His character says at one point,

389
00:14:23,222 --> 00:14:25,956
"I wasn't sure how many more
adventures I had ahead of me."

390
00:14:26,043 --> 00:14:29,148
And he sees, you know, this
mission aboard the Waverider

391
00:14:29,205 --> 00:14:31,333
as sort of his last great adventure.

392
00:14:32,813 --> 00:14:34,077
Everybody, run!

393
00:14:34,112 --> 00:14:35,051
When we first meet Jax,

394
00:14:35,086 --> 00:14:36,891
he's a star high-school football player,

395
00:14:36,965 --> 00:14:39,064
and when the Particle Accelerator explodes,

396
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:41,003
he's hurt and blows out his knee.

397
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:43,740
I never wanted to be a hero.

398
00:14:43,774 --> 00:14:45,274
What I wanted was to go to college,

399
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,710
but we couldn't afford it.

400
00:14:46,767 --> 00:14:48,184
Football was my way in.

401
00:14:48,219 --> 00:14:49,546
He does have a chance at greatness,

402
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,680
but in order to do it,

403
00:14:50,736 --> 00:14:52,101
he's going to have to share the greatness

404
00:14:52,205 --> 00:14:54,390
with this know-it-all
Professor Stein.

405
00:14:54,425 --> 00:14:56,195
Look, I know the Particle Accelerator

406
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,429
took something from you,

407
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,521
but it also gave you the opportunity

408
00:14:59,556 --> 00:15:02,080
to be part of something bigger.

409
00:15:02,115 --> 00:15:03,473
As much as he loves being a hero,

410
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:05,249
what he really loved about football

411
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,598
was being part of a team.

412
00:15:06,717 --> 00:15:07,828
I'll do it.

413
00:15:07,885 --> 00:15:08,553
You said this is a chance

414
00:15:08,618 --> 00:15:10,898
for me to be a part of
something bigger than myself.

415
00:15:10,933 --> 00:15:12,740
The selflessness that comes with, you know,

416
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:14,472
subverting the individuality

417
00:15:14,507 --> 00:15:16,913
and being part of something greater.

418
00:15:17,562 --> 00:15:19,899
Jax literally has this old guy

419
00:15:19,934 --> 00:15:22,411
in his head trying to tell
him how to be a superhero.

420
00:15:22,446 --> 00:15:24,773
Calm down, Jefferson.

421
00:15:24,878 --> 00:15:26,396
Focus.

422
00:15:27,288 --> 00:15:28,899
If they are able to work together

423
00:15:28,934 --> 00:15:30,326
and resolve their differences,

424
00:15:30,361 --> 00:15:32,742
they're one of the most
powerful beings on the planet.

425
00:15:32,777 --> 00:15:34,955
Not bad for your first go at this.

426
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:37,318
Well, I had a great coach
to help me through it.

427
00:15:37,413 --> 00:15:38,415
Isn't that right, Grey?

428
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:40,277
Despite my initial reservations,

429
00:15:40,312 --> 00:15:42,799
we make a pretty fantastic team.

430
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:43,859
Power and strength of youth

431
00:15:43,932 --> 00:15:47,236
mixed with the wisdom and courage of age.

432
00:15:47,344 --> 00:15:49,272
Are you ready, Jefferson?

433
00:15:49,398 --> 00:15:51,669
And it's embodied in Firestorm.

434
00:15:53,064 --> 00:15:55,740
It's the living embodiment of teamwork.

435
00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:00,938
The action sequences are even more epic

436
00:16:00,973 --> 00:16:02,976
than the action sequences
on "Flash" or "Arrow"

437
00:16:03,057 --> 00:16:05,959
because you have so many
other characters involved.

438
00:16:05,994 --> 00:16:07,615
People will tune in for that,

439
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,997
but what I think they're
ultimately gonna stay for

440
00:16:10,032 --> 00:16:11,628
are these characters.

441
00:16:11,662 --> 00:16:14,698
We've got an incredible
amount of combinations.

442
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,534
The storytelling possibilities
are really, really infinite.

443
00:16:17,597 --> 00:16:19,402
I like being part of the team, man.

444
00:16:19,468 --> 00:16:20,800
Me too.

445
00:16:37,193 --> 00:16:40,123
I say we gonna get weird in the '70s.

446
00:16:40,158 --> 00:16:41,512
Excellent idea.

447
00:16:41,547 --> 00:16:43,488
Each of the three shows are so distinctive,

448
00:16:43,523 --> 00:16:46,264
and they have such different
voices and different tones.

449
00:16:46,299 --> 00:16:48,150
Okay, we'll help you catch the bad guy.

450
00:16:48,185 --> 00:16:48,942
Partners?

451
00:16:48,977 --> 00:16:50,162
Partners.

452
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:53,991
If "Arrow" is vigilante crime drama...

453
00:16:54,088 --> 00:16:57,068
Whoever you fear, fear me more!

454
00:16:57,134 --> 00:17:03,139
...and "Flash" is superhero
adventure family show,

455
00:17:03,174 --> 00:17:06,828
then "Legends of Tomorrow"
is utterly bananas.

456
00:17:11,064 --> 00:17:13,560
It is superhero crack.

457
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:17,363
If "Arrow" is tough and dark and brooding,

458
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:20,433
and "Flash" is warm and fuzzy and fun,

459
00:17:20,529 --> 00:17:23,716
"Legends" is just insane and crazy.

460
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,138
I love the '70s!

461
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:29,736
And totally unpredictable.

462
00:17:29,771 --> 00:17:31,339
My name is Leonard Snart.

463
00:17:31,443 --> 00:17:32,358
I know who you are.

464
00:17:32,393 --> 00:17:34,918
Always pleased to meet a fan.

465
00:17:35,018 --> 00:17:35,748
_

466
00:17:35,783 --> 00:17:38,570
Leonard Snart is a nefarious criminal,

467
00:17:38,605 --> 00:17:41,663
sort of the bête noire of the Flash.

468
00:17:41,698 --> 00:17:45,239
You know what they say,
live fast, die young.

469
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:48,857
We've seen him develop his
own kind of new moral ethics.

470
00:17:48,952 --> 00:17:50,745
Why'd you shoot that guy?

471
00:17:50,852 --> 00:17:52,280
He owed me money.

472
00:17:52,403 --> 00:17:53,663
Captain Cold and his rogues,

473
00:17:53,721 --> 00:17:56,290
they really have a sense
of honor amongst themselves.

474
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,927
I'm a criminal and a liar.

475
00:17:59,032 --> 00:18:00,729
Then why didn't you just kill me?

476
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:03,034
Well, I guess you owe me one now, too.

477
00:18:03,145 --> 00:18:04,489
We first met him on "The Flash,"

478
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:07,439
and we saw how he became Captain Cold.

479
00:18:07,579 --> 00:18:09,114
The more we learn about his character,

480
00:18:09,149 --> 00:18:11,113
the more we realize that Leonard Snart

481
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:13,878
has a pretty good reason
for being the way he is.

482
00:18:13,913 --> 00:18:15,353
Snart's father was a cop.

483
00:18:15,464 --> 00:18:17,801
Bad cop... took his anger out on his kids.

484
00:18:17,893 --> 00:18:19,588
His father was a terrible person

485
00:18:19,623 --> 00:18:22,043
and severely abused him and his sister.

486
00:18:22,078 --> 00:18:23,701
I find the villains often

487
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:25,730
more heartbreaking than our heroes.

488
00:18:25,778 --> 00:18:27,465
Shoot him, son.

489
00:18:29,362 --> 00:18:31,433
He broke my sister's heart.

490
00:18:31,468 --> 00:18:33,582
Only fair I break his.

491
00:18:33,617 --> 00:18:35,134
Are you defined by your past,

492
00:18:35,169 --> 00:18:36,923
or can you change your destiny?

493
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:38,772
There's good in you, Snart.

494
00:18:38,807 --> 00:18:42,079
How do you go from this guy
who is an amoral killer...

495
00:18:42,113 --> 00:18:44,193
So, I should be a hero like you, Barry?

496
00:18:44,253 --> 00:18:45,760
...into somebody who can become a Legend?

497
00:18:45,795 --> 00:18:47,940
What exactly does that pay again?

498
00:18:48,037 --> 00:18:49,147
How does a villain react when

499
00:18:49,197 --> 00:18:51,127
they're given a chance
to help save the world?

500
00:18:51,162 --> 00:18:54,451
Is that issue more important
than just their own greed?

501
00:18:54,517 --> 00:18:57,065
Give me one reason I
don't kill you right now.

502
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,496
It's gonna be hard to find someone else

503
00:18:58,531 --> 00:19:00,633
to listen to your winning speeches.

504
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:02,177
_

505
00:19:02,212 --> 00:19:04,054
When you're going
against somebody ruthless,

506
00:19:04,089 --> 00:19:05,846
you have to fight fire with fire.

507
00:19:05,881 --> 00:19:09,225
In our case, literally,
with Mick Rory... Heatwave.

508
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,661
Mick is crazy.

509
00:19:11,721 --> 00:19:13,849
He is like a Primal Force of nature.

510
00:19:13,942 --> 00:19:17,113
He loves fire. He loves beating people up.

511
00:19:18,296 --> 00:19:19,525
Now that was fun!

512
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:22,334
A little bit dim, and a
man of dubious character.

513
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,054
Yeah!

514
00:19:24,089 --> 00:19:26,767
For all that, he's actually
the funniest person on the show.

515
00:19:26,802 --> 00:19:28,436
Let's get this party started!

516
00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:32,052
He's not afraid to die
and lives for the moment...

517
00:19:32,523 --> 00:19:35,575
and that's what time travel is all about.

518
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:39,000
They really are like an old married couple.

519
00:19:39,035 --> 00:19:40,195
Told you it would break.

520
00:19:40,274 --> 00:19:42,006
And the shrink says <i>I'm</i> crazy.

521
00:19:42,066 --> 00:19:44,692
They have only one person that they trust

522
00:19:44,765 --> 00:19:46,844
in the entire world...
and that's the other.

523
00:19:46,922 --> 00:19:47,847
Coming back 'round!

524
00:19:47,882 --> 00:19:49,845
Yeah, to die!

525
00:19:50,349 --> 00:19:52,086
It's fun to watch,

526
00:19:52,121 --> 00:19:55,868
in group of superheroes,
two villains on the team.

527
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,276
The flame?

528
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,561
Or the frost?

529
00:19:58,596 --> 00:20:01,207
Mick and Snart are as bad as the come.

530
00:20:01,303 --> 00:20:03,405
The question is, are
they gonna stay that way?

531
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,558
Sure it's a good idea to leave these
two unsupervised on a time machine?

532
00:20:06,608 --> 00:20:07,839
The scope of "Legends of Tomorrow"

533
00:20:07,936 --> 00:20:10,813
is about as big as any I've
ever worked on on television.

534
00:20:10,848 --> 00:20:13,772
All your worlds are about to change.

535
00:20:14,287 --> 00:20:17,567
Because the show can go
anywhere in human history...

536
00:20:17,602 --> 00:20:19,600
into our future, into our past,

537
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:22,287
it has high-stakes adventures.

538
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:30,455
Each one of these characters
could have had their own show,

539
00:20:30,544 --> 00:20:32,761
but, together, it's even bigger

540
00:20:32,796 --> 00:20:35,015
than any one of them could
have had individually.

541
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:37,727
So that sense of size and scope

542
00:20:37,762 --> 00:20:41,159
is gonna be really incredible
to see on television every week.

543
00:20:48,418 --> 00:20:49,684
Let's do this.

544
00:20:49,718 --> 00:20:54,718
