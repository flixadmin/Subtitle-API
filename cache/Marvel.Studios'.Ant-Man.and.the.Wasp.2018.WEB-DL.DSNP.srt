a bunch of confusing

Well, think of it this way.

on the walls.

167
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,440
Well, your daddy
went to Germany

168
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,480
and drew on the walls
with Captain America.

169
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,000
And that was a violation
of Article 16,

170
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,200
Paragraph Three
of the Sokovia Accords.

171
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,120
Now, as a part of
his joint plea deal...

172
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,520
with Homeland Security
and the German government...

173
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,400
he was allowed to return
to the U.S...

174
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,880
provided he serve two years
under house arrest...

175

followed by three years
of probation.

176

activities, technology...

177
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,000
or contact with any
former associates who were...

178
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,400

of time before we get 'em.

188

violated the Accords, too.

189
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,240
And associating with them
breaks your deal.

190

And, uh, I don't need
to remind you...

191

that any violation
of your agreement

It's called a hypothesis.

when you were down there,

you may have entangled
with her.

some kind of a message
in your head.

triggered it.

It's just the suit.

860
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,480
she goes through walls

Come on, we gotta be fast.

No.

00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,240
and that she should
watch you instead.

966
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,880
And sure enough,
she discovered

967
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:57,200
that you were
building the tunnel.

That's me. I'm sorry.

Look, can you tell me
who's texting me?

975
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,560
"Cassie, 911."

976
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,640
That's my daughter.
I need to text her back.

00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,080
No, that's not happening.

978
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,120
What, it's 911.
That means it's an emergency.

You're not making

Ava, I want to help you.

1001
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:57,880
She doesn't need your help.
I know how to save her.

1002
00:48:58,080 --> 00:48:59,280
Oh, really? How?

1003
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:00,440
Janet.

1004
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,080
For the last 30 years,
she's been down there

1005
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,160
absorbing quantum energy.

1006
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:04,680
We can extract that energy.

1007
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,160
We can use it to repair
Ava's molecular structure...

1008
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:08,160
Extract it?

1009

-Yes.
-Are you insane?

1010
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:11,160
That would rip Janet apart.

You don't know that.
I'm gonna fire up your tunnel.

When Janet's location

1013
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,040
pops into Lang's head,
he's gonna give it to me...

1014
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,000
or I'm gonna turn him over
to the FBI.

the entire system.

with all this time

1053
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:51,040
to prepare I'd be more ready.

1054

Oh, going subatomic isn't
something you can prepare for.

1055

It kind of melts your mind.

different person?

Yeah, like, uh,

00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:29,800
I got the location on Pym,
Van Dyne and Lang.

1273
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:31,200
But you gonna
have to take 'em down now,

1274
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,040
because they ain't gonna
be there for long.

1275
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,280
And when you do,
you gonna get me that lab.

1276
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:37,560
Understood.

1277
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:40,360
Good news, gentlemen.

1278
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:42,720
Feds are gonna do
the hard work for us.

1279
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,280
What are you lookin' at?
Change my tires!

1280

-STOLTZ: Sir.
-Can you knock?

1282
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:54,080
Sorry, sir.
Uh, but I just got a lead.

1283
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:57,200
Ooh, I love leads.

1284
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:05,000
System's in the green.

HOPE: Full charge.

1287
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:11,360
As soon
as the tunnel's open...

1288
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:12,600
let us know
if you get anything

1289
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:13,640
that could be a part of
her message.

1290
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,120
Yeah, yeah. I will.

1291
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:18,800
HANK: Okay, then.

1292
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:22,440
Here it goes.

1293
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,200
(CHUCKLES)

1294
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:37,920
We did it!

1295
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:39,960
You got anything?

1296
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:44,080
Nothin'.

1297
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:46,960
Well, just give it a minute,
because it could...

1298
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:49,640
No.

1299
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:51,360
No, no, no, no!

1300
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:52,440
What's happening?

1301
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:54,320
It's shutting down.
Maybe our vectors are off.

1302
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:56,760
We've gone over them a million
times, I know they're right!

1303
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:57,840
HOPE: Then what else
could it be?

1304
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,800
-HANK: I don't know!
-(ALARM BEEPING)

01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:07,240
-Scott, what are you doing?
-Scott, get away from that!

1306
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:08,280
Scott, you can't...

1307
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:10,120
I'm sorry, I don't know
how much time I have.

1308
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:11,480
I need to fix the algorithm.

1309
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:16,040
Trust me,
after 30 years down here...

1310
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:17,880
I've thought about it a lot.

1311
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:23,360
Janet?

1312
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:27,640
Hi, honey.

1313
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:32,560
Jellybean.

1314
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:34,320
Mom?

1315
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:36,960
It's not the reunion
I'd imagined.

1316
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:38,880
It's all so rushed.

1317
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:41,360
You two have done
such great work.

1318
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:43,480
You just need a little...

1319
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:45,200
nudge.

1320
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,920
HANK: Janet,
how is this possible?

1321
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:05,880
It wasn't a message you put

1322
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:07,280
in Scott's head.
It was an antenna.

1323
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:09,000
Clever girl.

1324
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:11,520
-I'm so proud of you.
-(CHUCKLES)

1325
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:13,360
Honey, tell us where you are.

1326
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:15,120
Tell us how to find you.

1327
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:17,120
No, the probability fields
are too complex.

1328
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:18,640
That's why I needed
to talk to you.

1329
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:20,240
You have to follow my voice.

1330
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:21,720
Of course!

1331
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:23,760
Like tracing a call
back to its source!

1332
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:31,840
HANK: I'm tracking your signal
using subatomic frequencies...

1333
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:34,280
between point two
and point nine.

1334
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,000
I'd narrow it to four and six.

1335
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:37,280
That's too tight.
We could miss you.

1336
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:39,040
Look at us squabbling again.

1337
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,600
Fine. All right,
between three and seven.

1338
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:46,160
Our first fight in decades,
and it's over just like that.

1339
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:48,160
(BOTH LAUGH)

1340

1342
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:05,720
It's you.

1343
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:07,920
HOPE: (LAUGHS) We got it!

1344
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:10,640
You have to meet me
at these exact coordinates.

1345
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:13,320
In the wasteland,
beyond the quantum void.

1346
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:14,640
It's very dangerous,

1347
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:16,760
especially on the human mind,
so be careful.

1348
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:19,480
Time and space work very
differently down here.

1349
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:21,040
You have two hours.

1350
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:22,880
After that, the probability
fields will shift...

1351
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:24,000
and it'll be another century

1352
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:25,520
before they align
like this again.

1353
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:27,720
HOPE: We'll find you.

1354
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:36,560
I know you will, Jellybean.

1355
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:42,600
Nope.

1356
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:44,600
Nothing. I got nothing.
No sign of Janet.

1357
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:45,800
Perfect.

1358
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:49,280
How did we get up here?

1359
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:55,840
All right, first you're gonna
see all kinds of lights...

1360
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:57,160
and it's gonna get
really trippy...

1361
01:02:57,320 --> 01:03:00,040
but then it's gonna turn black
and silent. Really silent.

1362
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:01,640
Scott, I'll be fine.

1363
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:03,320
I'm just saying
because I've been down there.

1364
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:04,840
Yeah, so you've mentioned.

1366

Um, sorry.
I have to take this.

1367
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,440

No, I'm not,
but you know what? Ghost is.

1369
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:16,480
And you know what? The Feds,
they know where you are.

01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:17,880
-What?
<i>-I'm sorry, I'm sorry.</i>

1371
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:19,280
Uh, they gave me
some truth serum.

1372
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:20,240
And then all of a sudden

1373
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:21,520
I started talkin'
all honestly.

1374
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:23,280
Like, I hate the way
that you load the dishwasher.

I'm a federal agent.

To shrink that wall.

1524

It looks load-bearing.

1525
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:21,760
The ceiling could collapse.

Then we run like hell.

1527

Now, I estimate 15-20 agents
on the floor.

Roughly five times that
in the building at large.

the first time...

1565
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:17,120

of sorts.

1582
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:31,680
So, we should do that.

1583
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:33,960
One, we have to break
into that lab.

1584
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:36,560
Two, we have to kick out
Foster and Ghost.

1585
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:38,880
Three, we're gonna
have to fight Ghost.

1586

That seems like it should be
part of two. 2-A, all right?

Fight Ghost. 2-A.

1589
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:46,400
Oh, also, we have to make sure
that the lab

is fully grown

what do you want to be
when you grow up?

01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:23,440
I wanna help people...

Really?

2078
01:46:28,080 --> 01:46:29,720
I wanted to be his partner.

2079
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:31,480
But he said he wants you.

I used to be
a respected scientist.

2091
01:49:06,560 --> 01:49:09,480
I had my name
on the sides of buildings.

2092
01:49:09,960 --> 01:49:11,000
Now, I got this.

a smaller quantum tunnel.

All right. Control's online.

The collection unit activates

2103

Also, make sure you stay
out of the tardigrade fields.

They're cute,
but they'll eat you.

And don't get sucked
