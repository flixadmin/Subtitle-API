1
00:01:50,785 --> 00:01:52,620
By the time I left Miami,

2
00:01:52,703 --> 00:01:56,082
Americans were doing a couple hundred tons
of cocaine every year.

3
00:01:57,583 --> 00:02:01,712
To satisfy American noses,
the narcos ramped up their operations.

4
00:02:03,923 --> 00:02:06,217
- Here, honey.
- Ah, thank you.

5
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:10,305
- Hey, is that the Bahamas?
- Hm?

6
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:14,351
Oh... Yeah.

7
00:02:14,558 --> 00:02:16,311
That's beautiful.

8
00:02:18,146 --> 00:02:19,730
They were flying so many planes,

9
00:02:19,814 --> 00:02:23,151
they needed a refueling stop
between Colombia and Miami.

10
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,237
So Carlos Lehder
bought an island in the Bahamas

11
00:02:26,321 --> 00:02:28,990
as a transshipment point
for the drugs and money.

12
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,828
Turns out...
it was a damn good place to party.

13
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:40,418
It was modern day Sodom and Gomorrah,
with the three things Carlos liked most:

14
00:02:40,501 --> 00:02:45,006
- sex, drugs, and Nazi sympathizers.
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!

15
00:02:45,089 --> 00:02:46,966
Let's get down!

16
00:02:51,179 --> 00:02:54,932
The problem was
no longer demand... it was supply.

17
00:03:02,106 --> 00:03:04,525
We should be over the Amazon by now.

18
00:03:06,736 --> 00:03:11,324
From 10,000 feet, Colombia
was a paradise of untouched rainforest.

19
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,869
But things were different
on the ground.

20
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:20,666
Pablo and his partners built superlabs
the size of small cities.

21
00:03:22,793 --> 00:03:28,966
From leaf to paste to powder,
they produced 10,000 kilos a week.

22
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:34,097
At 50 grand a kilo,
that's five billion dollars a year.

23
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,433
These guys weren't fuckin' around.

24
00:03:40,311 --> 00:03:45,358
Pablo's cousin Gustavo flew chemists in
from Germany to liquefy the cocaine.

25
00:03:45,442 --> 00:03:50,363
They added it to liquor, to coffee,
and just to be funny...

26
00:03:50,447 --> 00:03:51,989
they put it back in Coca-Cola.

27
00:03:52,073 --> 00:03:53,366
¿Patrón?

28
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:54,451
Looks good?

29
00:03:54,533 --> 00:03:56,953
Cocaine was no longer
hidden alongside products.

30
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:59,372
This is going
to sell better than the original.

31
00:03:59,456 --> 00:04:00,915
It was the product.

32
00:04:01,832 --> 00:04:04,252
It's time to take Pablo's money.

33
00:04:04,335 --> 00:04:07,797
The narcos even
had their own drug-sniffing dogs.

34
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,759
Gacha bet Pablo that not even
a German scientist could fool his dog.

35
00:04:11,842 --> 00:04:13,970
Search.

36
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:18,641
What's happening? Look at that.

37
00:04:18,724 --> 00:04:21,769
Your prize dog didn't even stop.

38
00:04:21,852 --> 00:04:24,063
There's no coke in that boat.

39
00:04:24,147 --> 00:04:25,189
Come here.

40
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:31,195
It's blended
right into the fiberglass hull.

41
00:04:31,862 --> 00:04:35,825
Give me the money...
the cash!

42
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:38,202
Looks like you got taken
with this dog, brother.

43
00:04:39,829 --> 00:04:43,333
- Hold this a moment.
- Oh, Marquessa, my dear...

44
00:04:44,292 --> 00:04:45,751
It's OK, it's OK.

45
00:04:50,131 --> 00:04:53,259
- Are you fucking crazy?
- What?

46
00:04:53,343 --> 00:04:54,760
It's my dog.

47
00:05:01,559 --> 00:05:02,810
Son of a bitch.

48
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,354
What happened?

49
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:06,856
You want to know what happened? Go look.

50
00:05:08,316 --> 00:05:09,526
Pablo?

51
00:05:09,608 --> 00:05:14,280
- Pablo, we have a motherfucking problem.
- Bastard murderer.

52
00:05:15,239 --> 00:05:16,919
- He killed the dog.
- I don't give a shit.

53
00:05:16,991 --> 00:05:20,119
If we don't resolve this problem,
we're all dead. Come on.

54
00:05:21,996 --> 00:05:25,291
- Come on, man.
- Son of a bitch.

55
00:05:28,545 --> 00:05:29,920
Let's see...

56
00:05:32,006 --> 00:05:34,384
This is the problem?

57
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:36,635
People are watching us, Pablo.

58
00:05:36,719 --> 00:05:39,514
They're asking themselves
how two small businessmen

59
00:05:39,597 --> 00:05:42,933
- suddenly came up with so much cash.
- Gustavo, brother...

60
00:05:44,185 --> 00:05:45,811
just launder the money.

61
00:05:46,854 --> 00:05:52,610
Make it look legitimate...
that's all.

62
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,738
Isn't that what Al Capone did?

63
00:05:57,656 --> 00:06:00,284
- Al Capone?
- Al Capone.

64
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,413
You're a dumbass, Pablo.

65
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:05,915
- Al Capone is a terrible example.
- Why?

66
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:08,626
Because Al Capone
never had this much cash.

67
00:06:09,793 --> 00:06:11,295
This is too much to launder.

68
00:06:12,422 --> 00:06:13,631
Well, then...

69
00:06:15,132 --> 00:06:17,427
let's buy a bigger washing machine.

70
00:06:18,386 --> 00:06:20,054
And that's what they tried first.

71
00:06:21,931 --> 00:06:26,102
On paper, Pablo had
the most profitable taxi company ever.

72
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:27,353
He only had three cars,

73
00:06:27,437 --> 00:06:30,773
but he was pulling in
more than five million dollars a week.

74
00:06:31,941 --> 00:06:35,319
And Gacha had the most successful
emerald mine of all time.

75
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:39,156
He would inject bad stones with oil
to make them shiny,

76
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,909
then have his friends in Miami
buy the emeralds with drug money

77
00:06:41,992 --> 00:06:44,245
and give them as gifts
to hookers in town.

78
00:06:45,496 --> 00:06:47,248
Everybody was happy.

79
00:06:50,334 --> 00:06:53,671
But no matter what they did,
they couldn't hide all that money.

80
00:06:54,631 --> 00:06:56,715
It just kept coming in.

81
00:06:57,634 --> 00:07:00,094
You're spending too much cash, Pablo.

82
00:07:01,262 --> 00:07:04,557
You have Picassos, Dalís, farms,

83
00:07:04,641 --> 00:07:08,436
houses, apartments, boats, planes, cars...

84
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,273
I told you we have to fly low.

85
00:07:13,107 --> 00:07:16,486
If you keep spending like that,
you're going to end up in Forbes Magazine.

86
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:18,904
And if that happens,
the government is going to have our asses.

87
00:07:18,988 --> 00:07:21,157
Enough, Gustavo, enough.

88
00:07:21,365 --> 00:07:23,326
What do you want me to say?

89
00:07:24,201 --> 00:07:25,828
Bury it.

90
00:07:25,911 --> 00:07:28,789
- How's that?
- Bury the cash.

91
00:07:28,872 --> 00:07:30,958
And cut the bullshit.

92
00:07:33,836 --> 00:07:35,129
Go on, pussy.

93
00:07:36,922 --> 00:07:39,509
And that's what they did.

94
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:41,760
They buried it in fields...

95
00:07:43,346 --> 00:07:47,308
they hid it in caletas,
hiding places in walls and ceilings.

96
00:07:49,018 --> 00:07:52,313
They even stuck a million dollars
in Pablo's mother's couch.

97
00:07:55,733 --> 00:07:57,401
Hey, Mom.

98
00:07:57,485 --> 00:08:00,530
- I'm praying, Pablo.
- Just for a second.

99
00:08:04,367 --> 00:08:05,493
Sit.

100
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,627
It isn't very comfortable, Pablito.

101
00:08:14,711 --> 00:08:16,546
I'll buy you another sofa later.

102
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:19,798
Wouldn't it be better
if you put all this money in a bank, son?

103
00:08:19,882 --> 00:08:21,592
No.

104
00:08:21,676 --> 00:08:24,136
All bankers are bandits.

105
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,722
Really, honey?

106
00:08:29,767 --> 00:08:31,935
Pablo called this accountant "Blackbeard,"

107
00:08:32,019 --> 00:08:33,854
not because he looked like a pirate,

108
00:08:33,937 --> 00:08:37,149
but because his job was to map out
where the treasure was hidden.

109
00:08:39,902 --> 00:08:42,321
But not even the pirate did the trick.

110
00:08:42,405 --> 00:08:44,574
The problem was Colombia itself.

111
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:47,702
It was too small a country
for a fortune that big.

112
00:08:47,785 --> 00:08:52,873
It was inevitable... someone, somewhere
would try to snatch the narcos' treasure.

113
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:56,877
Forbes Magazine says...

114
00:08:57,754 --> 00:09:00,089
that the narcos have more money

115
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:03,259
than the richest capitalist pig
in this country.

116
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:06,763
Let me see?

117
00:09:06,845 --> 00:09:10,015
If we kidnap someone in their family,
what are they going to do?

118
00:09:10,099 --> 00:09:12,142
Call the police?

119
00:09:12,226 --> 00:09:13,226
Commander.

120
00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:18,649
It says here that Gacha, "The Mexican,"
is the ninth richest man in the world.

121
00:09:18,733 --> 00:09:20,651
I say we kidnap his son.

122
00:09:20,859 --> 00:09:24,447
He's a psycho maniac, comrade.

123
00:09:25,406 --> 00:09:28,618
Plus, he's bought off half the military.

124
00:09:28,826 --> 00:09:32,371
Well, the Ochoa brothers
are number 14 on the list.

125
00:09:32,455 --> 00:09:34,791
Their sister Marta
goes to the university.

126
00:09:34,873 --> 00:09:36,083
How about her?

127
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:42,632
I like that more.
The Ochoas are soft.

128
00:09:43,841 --> 00:09:45,175
Wait a second.

129
00:09:46,302 --> 00:09:48,220
What about Pablo Escobar?

130
00:09:48,304 --> 00:09:50,180
I know what you're thinking.

131
00:09:50,264 --> 00:09:53,058
No one's crazy enough
to kidnap drug dealers, right?

132
00:09:53,892 --> 00:09:57,772
But if you're thinking that, it's because
you're not familiar with M-19.

133
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:01,609
M-19 was a communist guerrilla group

134
00:10:01,692 --> 00:10:03,986
made up of college students
and intellectuals

135
00:10:04,069 --> 00:10:06,530
who read too much Karl Marx
for their own good.

136
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,452
Their leader was
Ivan "the Terrible" Torres...

137
00:10:11,535 --> 00:10:14,246
a history professor
who knew nothing about guerilla warfare,

138
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:16,624
but understood the power of symbols.

139
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:19,794
He broke into
the Quinta de Bolívar Museum

140
00:10:19,877 --> 00:10:23,881
with his buddy Alejandro
and Alejandro's girlfriend, Elisa,

141
00:10:23,964 --> 00:10:28,344
and stole a national treasure...
the sword of Simón Bolívar,

142
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:32,306
the mythic general who led Colombia
to independence from the Spanish empire.

143
00:10:48,739 --> 00:10:50,825
These jokers even left a note:

144
00:10:51,992 --> 00:10:54,953
"Bolívar, your sword
returns to the battlefield."

145
00:10:56,664 --> 00:11:01,293
It was a stroke of genius...
a marketing stunt way ahead of its time.

146
00:11:01,377 --> 00:11:03,379
And it made them famous overnight.

147
00:11:05,715 --> 00:11:07,717
And I guess it went to their heads.

148
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:12,346
What about Pablo Escobar?
He's the richest of them all.

149
00:11:13,389 --> 00:11:15,474
Escobar gives money to the poor.

150
00:11:15,558 --> 00:11:18,853
You're right.
Escobar is a man of the people.

151
00:11:18,936 --> 00:11:20,270
He's all right with me.

152
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:21,980
OK, then.

153
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,442
Let's do the Ochoas.

154
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:54,471
March 13th, 1981,
the day they kidnapped Marta Ochoa,

155
00:11:54,555 --> 00:11:58,100
was also the day the Lion
completed 100 trips to Miami.

156
00:12:02,479 --> 00:12:03,856
Hola.

157
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,900
Good afternoon.

158
00:12:08,611 --> 00:12:11,238
- Mr. and Mrs. Murphy.
- Sí.

159
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:14,491
Does the cat have any papers?

160
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,702
- Sí.
- Please.

161
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,373
Thank you.

162
00:12:25,586 --> 00:12:26,754
Mm.

163
00:12:30,007 --> 00:12:31,759
Excuse me a second, please.

164
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:46,857
Sir, this couple has no sanitary B-47 form

165
00:12:46,941 --> 00:12:48,692
and no I-435
identifying papers, either.

166
00:12:48,776 --> 00:12:50,820
Well, I guess he's talking about Puff.

167
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:53,781
Yes, sir.
They brought an American cat with them.

168
00:12:55,032 --> 00:13:00,537
Sure, but without the I-435, I can't
officially state that it is indeed a cat.

169
00:13:02,456 --> 00:13:06,543
I also can't guarantee
that it's American.

170
00:13:09,046 --> 00:13:12,090
Sir, I'm not trying
to make your life more difficult.

171
00:13:14,092 --> 00:13:15,092
OK, sir.

172
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,599
My boss is not having a good day.

173
00:13:20,683 --> 00:13:22,685
I think his wife left him.

174
00:13:25,312 --> 00:13:30,901
Yeah, well, he's a little bit cranky,
so... how important is this cat to you?

175
00:13:31,151 --> 00:13:32,444
Excuse me?

176
00:13:32,653 --> 00:13:34,237
OK.

177
00:13:34,321 --> 00:13:35,322
Come with me, please.

178
00:13:56,552 --> 00:13:58,762
So... wait here, please.

179
00:14:00,014 --> 00:14:02,683
And my boss will ask you
for this paper later.

180
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:05,394
How long is it gonna be?

181
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:06,645
I don't know.

182
00:14:10,232 --> 00:14:12,150
Pablo! Pablo!

183
00:14:12,234 --> 00:14:14,319
While I was trying to get into Bogotá,

184
00:14:14,403 --> 00:14:16,947
Pablo was trying to get into politics.

185
00:14:17,031 --> 00:14:21,077
When he said he was going
to be president of Colombia, he meant it.

186
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:23,913
- Hello, Pablo.
- Hello, Valeria.

187
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:27,249
- This is my wife, Tata.
- Hello.

188
00:14:27,332 --> 00:14:29,543
Don't worry.
Everything will be perfect.

189
00:14:29,626 --> 00:14:32,462
I'm just not used
to these type of things.

190
00:14:32,546 --> 00:14:33,964
Just be yourself.

191
00:14:34,924 --> 00:14:37,175
Ma'am, it would be best
if you weren't here.

192
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:42,431
Look, Tata,
there are a lot of people here.

193
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:44,349
It might not be good for the baby.

194
00:14:46,102 --> 00:14:47,477
Go to the house.

195
00:15:00,323 --> 00:15:02,659
Where is this guy?
We've been waiting for hours now.

196
00:15:04,411 --> 00:15:07,581
Maybe he's at "terapia de pareja."

197
00:15:07,664 --> 00:15:09,125
What's that?

198
00:15:09,207 --> 00:15:10,626
Couples counseling.

199
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:13,211
Right.

200
00:15:14,171 --> 00:15:15,589
What're you doing?

201
00:15:15,672 --> 00:15:17,674
Oh, I'm practicing my Spanish.

202
00:15:17,758 --> 00:15:19,176
Welcome to Nuevos Tiempos.

203
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:23,680
I'm Valeria Velez and I'm here with the
man known as "the Robin Hood of the poor"

204
00:15:23,764 --> 00:15:26,308
for his generosity
with the poor of Medellín.

205
00:15:26,391 --> 00:15:28,518
Yeah, you heard that right.

206
00:15:28,602 --> 00:15:32,355
She just compared Pablo Escobar
to fucking Robin Hood.

207
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:35,192
And in a way, she was right.

208
00:15:35,275 --> 00:15:37,115
When you've run out of ways
to hide your money,

209
00:15:37,153 --> 00:15:39,571
that's when you give it to the poor.

210
00:15:39,655 --> 00:15:41,698
But I don't want to get ahead of myself.

211
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:45,452
Tell us about your program,
"Medellín Without Slums," Mr. Escobar.

212
00:15:45,535 --> 00:15:48,538
I was born in Rionegro,
not too far from here.

213
00:15:48,622 --> 00:15:53,335
And I asked myself how a government
that exists for the people

214
00:15:53,418 --> 00:15:56,213
can be so out of touch
with what they need.

215
00:15:56,296 --> 00:15:58,966
Hospitals, social and athletic programs,

216
00:15:59,049 --> 00:16:02,178
plus the construction
of 400 houses in this community.

217
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:06,223
I hear you told your mother that one day
you would be president of Colombia.

218
00:16:06,306 --> 00:16:08,225
Do you have any political aspirations,
Mr. Escobar?

219
00:16:08,308 --> 00:16:12,688
None at all.
My business takes up most of my time.

220
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:14,690
I will tell you one thing, Valeria.

221
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:20,988
For decades, our country has been led by
Lopez and other families that are wealthy

222
00:16:21,071 --> 00:16:23,824
who made their fortune
off exploiting the poor.

223
00:16:24,033 --> 00:16:28,204
They don't know what
common people dream of, but I do...

224
00:16:28,286 --> 00:16:30,664
Connie, you know who that is?

225
00:16:30,747 --> 00:16:33,250
Bet he could get our cat
into the country.

226
00:16:34,459 --> 00:16:35,961
I can't believe it.

227
00:16:36,837 --> 00:16:39,215
They don't even know
he's a fucking drug dealer.

228
00:16:39,422 --> 00:16:42,676
- Thank you very much.
- Pablo! Pablo! Pablo!

229
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,972
At the time,
Pablo was just a blip on my radar.

230
00:16:47,723 --> 00:16:50,392
I didn't know
I was about to be a blip on his.

231
00:16:57,941 --> 00:17:00,402
Well, we've been waiting
for hours. Thanks for coming out.

232
00:17:00,527 --> 00:17:04,698
Uh, my wife's a little exhausted,
so here is the cat's vaccination...

233
00:17:04,781 --> 00:17:06,283
Your passport.

234
00:17:07,243 --> 00:17:08,244
I'm sorry?

235
00:17:09,203 --> 00:17:11,121
Your passport, please.

236
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:19,588
Gracias.

237
00:17:29,806 --> 00:17:33,894
What do you do at
the United States Embassy, Mr. Murphy?

238
00:17:33,977 --> 00:17:36,230
I am in, uh,
janitorial services.

239
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:39,524
Janitorial services.

240
00:17:39,608 --> 00:17:41,151
Another one.

241
00:17:42,444 --> 00:17:44,738
Your embassy must be very clean.

242
00:17:44,947 --> 00:17:48,575
Oh, yeah.
You bet your ass it is.

243
00:17:50,077 --> 00:17:51,328
Your cat's cleared.

244
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:55,457
Enjoy Colombia.

245
00:18:01,504 --> 00:18:05,592
And just like that, the narcos
had me on file the very first day.

246
00:18:25,321 --> 00:18:27,239
As for Valeria Velez,

247
00:18:27,323 --> 00:18:31,451
the journalist who first
interviewed Pablo... watch out.

248
00:18:31,534 --> 00:18:33,954
She was as dangerous as M-19.

249
00:18:48,802 --> 00:18:50,720
Does your wife do it standing up?

250
00:18:50,804 --> 00:18:55,100
Aah!

251
00:18:55,184 --> 00:18:59,021
Don't ever disrespect Tata.

252
00:18:59,896 --> 00:19:02,232
Do you hear me?

253
00:19:04,985 --> 00:19:08,571
I'm sorry, Pablo...
I'm sorry.

254
00:19:11,033 --> 00:19:12,450
Forgive me.

255
00:19:17,247 --> 00:19:19,082
It won't happen again.

256
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:20,334
I promise.

257
00:19:31,387 --> 00:19:34,639
How can I apologize? Huh?

258
00:19:49,112 --> 00:19:51,781
Want to put it in my ass? Hm?

259
00:19:55,535 --> 00:19:57,120
You gotta give it to her.

260
00:19:57,204 --> 00:20:00,290
She saw Pablo coming a mile away.

261
00:20:00,374 --> 00:20:04,544
And she got herself in just the
right place to take full advantage of him.

262
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:08,590
Not unlike my partner Javier Peña,

263
00:20:08,673 --> 00:20:11,468
who figured the best way
to get inside narco information

264
00:20:11,551 --> 00:20:13,762
was to hang out
with the same women they did.

265
00:20:44,667 --> 00:20:46,878
We get better every time we practice.

266
00:20:46,962 --> 00:20:48,964
You're amazing, Javier.

267
00:20:51,508 --> 00:20:52,842
Well...

268
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:58,056
don't go overboard.

269
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:05,814
It's the truth.

270
00:21:07,357 --> 00:21:09,192
What can you offer me to drink?

271
00:21:09,276 --> 00:21:11,528
Whiskey or tap water.

272
00:21:12,654 --> 00:21:14,239
Water.

273
00:21:24,749 --> 00:21:27,627
What you're missing
in this apartment is a woman.

274
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:29,587
It's fine the way it is.

275
00:21:30,547 --> 00:21:33,842
Well, I wasn't offering.

276
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:43,519
Here.

277
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,775
If you were a client,
you would have paid me already.

278
00:21:54,321 --> 00:21:57,240
- And you wouldn't know my real name.
- Don't take it the wrong way.

279
00:21:57,324 --> 00:22:01,370
It's cash from Uncle Sam
for the information you never gave me.

280
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:05,957
Take it.

281
00:22:08,626 --> 00:22:10,045
And my visa?

282
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:14,216
Give me something I can use
and we'll talk about it.

283
00:22:20,263 --> 00:22:22,265
What are you doing this weekend?

284
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:25,435
- I'm going to Medellín.
- Work or play?

285
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:28,230
I have to take care of my child.

286
00:22:28,938 --> 00:22:30,815
I can pay, too.

287
00:22:34,403 --> 00:22:36,863
Those guys are richer
than Uncle Sam, Javi.

288
00:22:40,534 --> 00:22:41,659
Come here.

289
00:22:44,371 --> 00:22:46,456
- What?
- Give me a kiss.

290
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:49,000
Give me a kiss.

291
00:22:59,844 --> 00:23:02,514
I guess I'll have to find another girl.

292
00:23:02,722 --> 00:23:06,351
Good luck with that.
We're all going to Medellín.

293
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,520
Some of us are even going by plane.

294
00:23:11,689 --> 00:23:13,400
Helena?

295
00:23:13,483 --> 00:23:14,901
Helena.

296
00:23:18,821 --> 00:23:20,282
Whose party is it?

297
00:23:26,996 --> 00:23:29,874
Oh, God! What was that?

298
00:23:29,958 --> 00:23:31,084
That was like a .38.

299
00:23:31,167 --> 00:23:33,128
- About four blocks away.
- Oh...

300
00:23:48,768 --> 00:23:52,772
Welcome to Bogotá.

301
00:23:52,855 --> 00:23:55,651
Should we do it under the bed?

302
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:23,761
Just one thing...
Who told you about this?

303
00:24:26,014 --> 00:24:27,849
Mother Teresa of Calcutta.

304
00:24:37,859 --> 00:24:42,197
Pablo says they're
not going to pay a dime for Marta Ochoa.

305
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,532
Gustavo, too.

306
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:48,411
- And Jorge?
- No. Jorge doesn't agree.

307
00:24:48,495 --> 00:24:51,914
- Then what?
- They're all going to a meeting.

308
00:24:51,998 --> 00:24:54,000
At Las Margaritas.

309
00:24:54,083 --> 00:24:56,753
- Everyone?
- Yeah, they'll all be there.

310
00:25:05,721 --> 00:25:08,515
First day at the American Embassy.

311
00:25:08,598 --> 00:25:11,142
- I met my partner...
- Javier?

312
00:25:11,226 --> 00:25:13,436
Who introduced me to the DEA.

313
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,230
Murphy, this is Weaver and Wisnicki.

314
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:17,273
These guys are R.I.P.
"Retired in Place."

315
00:25:17,357 --> 00:25:19,275
- Eat me, Peña.
- Paid vacation's over, fellas.

316
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:20,759
Murphy and I are going to Medellín.

317
00:25:20,818 --> 00:25:23,697
We'll telex the T-3 reports.
They go straight to Washington.

318
00:25:25,407 --> 00:25:27,242
We are going to Medellín?

319
00:25:28,201 --> 00:25:31,454
- Then the Mil Group.
- Jarheads... this is Murphy.

320
00:25:31,538 --> 00:25:32,914
Murphy, this is Mil Group.

321
00:25:32,997 --> 00:25:36,501
They advise Colombian military
on communist threats in the countryside.

322
00:25:36,585 --> 00:25:37,960
Hey, those are classified.

323
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:41,172
- Now they're declassified.
- That's the ambassador's call.

324
00:25:41,256 --> 00:25:42,758
No problem.

325
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:49,723
And the last stop...
the ambassador's office.

326
00:25:49,806 --> 00:25:51,099
Why do you need this intel?

327
00:25:52,225 --> 00:25:55,144
There's an unusual number of prostitutes
headed to Medellín this weekend.

328
00:25:55,353 --> 00:25:56,896
Every high-end girl in Bogotá.

329
00:25:56,979 --> 00:25:59,148
First class airfare,
five-star hotels.

330
00:25:59,357 --> 00:26:01,401
The narcos are having a meeting
and then a party.

331
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:03,861
What does the M-19
have to do with this?

332
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:06,823
Somebody kidnapped Marta Ochoa.
Intel suggests it was M-19.

333
00:26:06,906 --> 00:26:09,826
I need access to the M-19 files
to confirm.

334
00:26:10,577 --> 00:26:14,205
If I find out one single dollar
of American taxpayer money

335
00:26:14,289 --> 00:26:17,709
went to any of those hookers,
it'll be your ass.

336
00:26:17,917 --> 00:26:19,919
OK, thank you.
One last thing, Ambassador.

337
00:26:20,002 --> 00:26:21,212
Yes, Agent Peña?

338
00:26:21,421 --> 00:26:24,021
I'm filing a visa request
for my informant. I need your signature.

339
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:25,759
You're bothering me.

340
00:26:27,885 --> 00:26:29,805
She sure likes you.

341
00:26:29,887 --> 00:26:31,640
Is your informant really a prostitute?

342
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:33,516
Everybody works for somebody.

343
00:26:41,149 --> 00:26:44,360
The very next day,
I was flying with Peña to Medellín,

344
00:26:44,444 --> 00:26:46,195
Pablo's home turf.

345
00:26:53,202 --> 00:26:58,583
First stop: Carlos Holguín School,
Colonel Carrillo's base of operations.

346
00:27:09,385 --> 00:27:11,847
- Good day, Major.
- Good day.

347
00:27:11,929 --> 00:27:16,852
Your intel was good. The traquetos
are gathering at Las Margaritas.

348
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:20,772
I want you
to meet our new DEA, Steve Murphy.

349
00:27:20,856 --> 00:27:22,482
Fresh meat.

350
00:27:25,652 --> 00:27:29,865
Then we went straight to a fancy
hotel where the narcos were about to meet.

351
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:36,579
The pictures I took that day
helped to ID guys for months to come.

352
00:27:39,582 --> 00:27:42,043
There was Carlos Lehder...

353
00:27:45,254 --> 00:27:47,674
the Ochoa brothers...

354
00:27:53,262 --> 00:27:55,640
Fernando Galeano,
"the Wolfman"...

355
00:28:07,235 --> 00:28:08,862
Is that Gacha?

356
00:28:09,779 --> 00:28:12,323
I've never seen him
with other traffickers.

357
00:28:14,534 --> 00:28:18,996
And last but not least...
Gustavo and Pablo.

358
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:22,918
Get pictures of that fucker.

359
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:31,676
They were all under one roof
and Peña got us there to document it all.

360
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:39,976
What we didn't know was
that we were witnessing the formation

361
00:28:40,059 --> 00:28:42,144
of the famed Medellín cartel.

362
00:28:43,145 --> 00:28:46,023
Pablo took advantage
of the kidnapping of Marta Ochoa

363
00:28:46,107 --> 00:28:49,485
to bring all the narcos together
for the very first time.

364
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:53,615
And then he proclaimed himself
their leader.

365
00:28:55,742 --> 00:28:58,787
What I propose at this moment, gentlemen,

366
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:02,749
is that we form an organization.

367
00:29:02,832 --> 00:29:09,839
Pool our resources to train soldiers,
trade knowledge and buy information.

368
00:29:10,673 --> 00:29:15,971
And so the message is clear,
we're going to name our group

369
00:29:16,053 --> 00:29:18,306
"Death to Kidnappers."

370
00:29:20,475 --> 00:29:22,143
What I propose:

371
00:29:23,019 --> 00:29:25,981
I will manage all operational aspects.

372
00:29:26,063 --> 00:29:28,650
All you need to do
is cover my expenses.

373
00:29:30,026 --> 00:29:34,697
What you gentlemen will receive in return:
two things.

374
00:29:34,781 --> 00:29:37,826
One... I promise to end the kidnapping.

375
00:29:38,743 --> 00:29:42,371
Two... and at this moment,
the most important...

376
00:29:43,498 --> 00:29:47,669
I promise to return
Marta Ochoa to her family.

377
00:29:47,877 --> 00:29:50,338
Salud.

378
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:53,925
Death to Kidnappers!

379
00:29:59,597 --> 00:30:02,391
We knew the meeting was over
when the hookers came to play.

380
00:30:03,643 --> 00:30:05,812
Peña had finally
gotten one of his informants

381
00:30:05,895 --> 00:30:07,814
right into the heart of the action.

382
00:30:09,315 --> 00:30:12,694
Come in! Enjoy! Ooh!

383
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:15,738
Don't forget La Quica!
Take care of him, too.

384
00:30:20,869 --> 00:30:22,453
Sit down, my love.

385
00:30:25,081 --> 00:30:27,750
- How are you?
- Good. And you?

386
00:30:27,834 --> 00:30:29,794
I like your hat.

387
00:30:29,878 --> 00:30:31,713
It looks good on you.

388
00:30:32,547 --> 00:30:34,215
- Do you think so?
- Yes, it looks good.

389
00:30:34,298 --> 00:30:35,550
Let's see.

390
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:39,303
Very cute.

391
00:30:45,935 --> 00:30:47,729
She should be here by now.

392
00:30:48,688 --> 00:30:50,231
You think she slipped?

393
00:30:50,439 --> 00:30:52,400
Nah, she's no dummy.

394
00:30:56,571 --> 00:30:58,823
Maybe she's getting pretty for you.

395
00:30:58,907 --> 00:31:00,116
Yeah.

396
00:31:13,254 --> 00:31:16,549
Aah...

397
00:31:18,093 --> 00:31:20,053
Helena wanted a US visa so bad,

398
00:31:20,136 --> 00:31:22,972
she was willing to do anything
to help our cause.

399
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:25,892
And that was a problem.

400
00:31:27,143 --> 00:31:30,438
- You're tired.
- Hm?

401
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,482
Let me relax you a bit.

402
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:42,283
So what happened at that meeting
that made you so tired?

403
00:31:47,455 --> 00:31:49,665
What did you hear?

404
00:31:49,749 --> 00:31:52,043
Nothing.
Just making conversation.

405
00:31:58,674 --> 00:32:01,552
They're
telling me the girl left a long time ago.

406
00:32:02,845 --> 00:32:06,015
- She's already dead.
- No, they wouldn't kill her at the hotel.

407
00:32:06,099 --> 00:32:07,809
Then they killed her somewhere else.

408
00:32:07,892 --> 00:32:09,685
She knew the risks.

409
00:32:09,769 --> 00:32:11,729
If we're going back,
we go back now.

410
00:32:14,816 --> 00:32:16,567
I want you to find the girl.

411
00:32:18,111 --> 00:32:20,321
I can pick up a sicario.
You OK with that?

412
00:32:20,404 --> 00:32:22,406
- I'm going with you.
- What about Fresh Meat?

413
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:24,826
Gonna stick around here
and see if she shows up, OK?

414
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:27,745
- Yeah, and where are you going?
- We're gonna go look for her.

415
00:32:27,829 --> 00:32:29,330
That's it, guys.

416
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,598
- Guys.
- Hey, what happened?

417
00:32:47,682 --> 00:32:49,934
That little girl doesn't move.
Like a dead cow.

418
00:32:50,018 --> 00:32:51,393
What, did you kill her?

419
00:33:00,402 --> 00:33:02,363
It's my turn now.

420
00:33:20,297 --> 00:33:22,884
Where's the girl?

421
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:25,887
- Where's the girl, asshole?
- I don't know.

422
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:28,514
I don't know.

423
00:33:29,682 --> 00:33:31,059
Choke him.

424
00:33:40,985 --> 00:33:43,988
Enough with the party.

425
00:33:45,656 --> 00:33:48,284
I gotta rough this girl up.

426
00:33:48,367 --> 00:33:50,494
Gacha wants to know
if she knows something.

427
00:33:50,578 --> 00:33:53,081
Gacha's paranoid.

428
00:33:54,456 --> 00:33:58,794
Wait a second...
I don't like them bruised.

429
00:33:58,878 --> 00:34:01,256
Let me have a little more fun,
then I'll let her go.

430
00:34:01,338 --> 00:34:03,799
It's all right, boys.

431
00:34:03,883 --> 00:34:05,301
This one's for all of you!

432
00:34:05,509 --> 00:34:08,763
Slap her around!

433
00:34:23,319 --> 00:34:24,862
Any news on the radio?

434
00:34:24,946 --> 00:34:28,490
- Should I tell him?
- No. Remember what Carrillo said.

435
00:34:28,574 --> 00:34:30,534
Sorry, I don't speak English.

436
00:34:41,587 --> 00:34:44,381
- How far is it?
- Come on, you piece of shit.

437
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:42,023
Helena?

438
00:35:45,401 --> 00:35:50,531
I'm going to get you
out of here, OK? I promise.

439
00:36:07,006 --> 00:36:10,134
All right. She's coming out.

440
00:36:14,805 --> 00:36:16,432
Copy, Major.

441
00:36:16,515 --> 00:36:17,599
Let's go, boys.

442
00:36:19,227 --> 00:36:21,645
Hey, gringo.
Carrillo is calling. Come on.

443
00:36:23,189 --> 00:36:25,441
No habla inglés, huh?

444
00:36:26,317 --> 00:36:27,317
¡Vamos!

445
00:36:35,492 --> 00:36:37,286
Where the fuck's Peña?
¿Dónde está Peña?

446
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:38,620
Over there.

447
00:36:55,263 --> 00:36:58,557
- How is she?
- Sedated.

448
00:37:00,226 --> 00:37:03,229
- Is she gonna be OK?
- Physically, yeah.

449
00:37:03,312 --> 00:37:05,481
Mentally, I haven't got a fucking clue.

450
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:09,151
- You left me behind on purpose.
- Look, man...

451
00:37:09,235 --> 00:37:11,528
If we're gonna be partners,
I don't get left behind.

452
00:37:11,612 --> 00:37:15,199
I didn't come all the way down here, Peña,
to sit on the fucking sidelines.

453
00:37:18,619 --> 00:37:24,041
Whatever's going on here...
I'm in all the way.

454
00:37:24,125 --> 00:37:25,751
Is that understood?

455
00:37:30,839 --> 00:37:32,091
Understood.

456
00:37:36,345 --> 00:37:38,139
I hope you know what that means.

457
00:37:46,772 --> 00:37:49,900
Pablo's message
to the kidnappers was simple.

458
00:37:49,984 --> 00:37:54,947
He was going to kill them, one by one,
until he got Marta Ochoa back.

459
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:58,951
Ivan "the Terrible" thought he could
hide in the jungle and wait it out.

460
00:37:59,034 --> 00:38:02,037
Sooner or later,
he figured the narcos would cave in.

461
00:38:02,871 --> 00:38:04,581
Big mistake.

462
00:38:04,665 --> 00:38:07,042
M-19 didn't stand a chance.

463
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:21,390
"Deliver Marta Ochoa
safe and sound... or your family is next."

464
00:38:22,517 --> 00:38:24,435
Signed, "Death to Kidnappers."

465
00:38:31,025 --> 00:38:32,818
Please! Please, let me go.

466
00:38:33,027 --> 00:38:35,404
- Hurry up!
- Please, don't!

467
00:38:35,488 --> 00:38:39,367
Needless to say,
Marta Ochoa was released unharmed.

468
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,293
And the killing didn't stop.

469
00:38:50,211 --> 00:38:53,797
Pablo had tasted blood,
and he liked it.

470
00:38:54,006 --> 00:38:57,468
Tell him to get a little closer.

471
00:38:57,552 --> 00:39:00,221
A little closer. A little closer!

472
00:39:00,304 --> 00:39:03,057
You know what, boss?
Go a little higher.

473
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:05,226
A little bit higher
and a little bit closer

474
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:07,228
so you can see the tree!

475
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:09,813
That's it.

476
00:39:11,899 --> 00:39:15,986
Now a little bit higher
so you can see the little tree!

477
00:39:17,112 --> 00:39:18,573
That...

478
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,157
That's it. Perfect.

479
00:39:20,241 --> 00:39:21,409
DEATH TO KIDNAPPERS

480
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:23,077
A little more.

481
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,163
That's it! There you go.

482
00:39:28,707 --> 00:39:30,834
- Much better.
- Yes, boss.

483
00:39:37,425 --> 00:39:41,178
Didn't I tell you
not to let anyone into the park?

484
00:39:41,262 --> 00:39:43,431
- I'll take care of it.
- Are you crazy or what?

485
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:45,474
Stupid asshole.

486
00:39:45,558 --> 00:39:47,309
It's a woman with a baby.

487
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:52,106
Take a picture
so we can send it to the newspapers.

488
00:39:52,189 --> 00:39:53,357
Do it.

489
00:39:53,441 --> 00:39:55,401
Good day, ma'am.

490
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:59,696
- Good day.
- I'm sorry, but the park is closed today.

491
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:01,740
What do you mean the park is closed?

492
00:40:01,823 --> 00:40:03,909
May I escort you out?

493
00:40:03,992 --> 00:40:06,454
Why is it closed?
I come by here every day.

494
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:11,708
It's because there is a foul odor
and I don't want the child to get sick.

495
00:40:11,792 --> 00:40:14,002
I thought I smelled something.

496
00:40:14,086 --> 00:40:15,504
- Right?
- Yes.

497
00:40:15,588 --> 00:40:17,298
Oh, look,
what a beautiful little baby.

498
00:40:17,381 --> 00:40:19,841
Right, just like his dad.
Thank you very much.

499
00:40:19,925 --> 00:40:22,970
- You must be proud.
- Yes, of course.

500
00:40:23,053 --> 00:40:26,140
My wife and I
are having a baby very soon.

501
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:28,517
Oh, very good.
Congratulations!

502
00:40:28,601 --> 00:40:31,479
I don't know if it's a boy or a girl,
but as long as it's healthy.

503
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:36,108
Yes, of course.
The most important thing is health.

504
00:40:37,734 --> 00:40:41,196
Sending the photos
of the hanging M-19 to the newspapers

505
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,032
gave Pablo an image of invincibility.

506
00:40:44,783 --> 00:40:47,328
If he could do this
to the feared communists,

507
00:40:47,411 --> 00:40:49,037
he could do it to anyone.

508
00:40:50,498 --> 00:40:53,208
Ivan "the Terrible"
was quick to realize...

509
00:40:53,292 --> 00:40:55,377
there was only one thing he could do.

510
00:40:57,713 --> 00:40:59,214
Hey, Don Pablo.

511
00:41:00,757 --> 00:41:02,884
What do you want us to do
with this guy?

512
00:41:05,471 --> 00:41:07,055
Should I kill him or what?

513
00:41:15,814 --> 00:41:18,150
From what I can see,
you're not going to stop.

514
00:41:19,485 --> 00:41:22,112
Here I am,
so you can finish what you started...

515
00:41:23,822 --> 00:41:26,200
but with the sword of Bolívar.

516
00:41:52,518 --> 00:41:56,230
It's a very beautiful gift.
Thank you very much.

517
00:42:01,026 --> 00:42:02,110
Stand up.

518
00:42:05,989 --> 00:42:11,953
I guarantee no harm
will come to you or your family.

519
00:42:16,584 --> 00:42:20,087
From now on,
we are going to work together.

520
00:42:27,969 --> 00:42:29,263
Go in peace, brother.

521
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:46,614
Is that what I think it is?

522
00:42:47,656 --> 00:42:49,283
You've gotta be kidding.

523
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:58,500
I want you
to run my day-to-day operations.

524
00:43:00,753 --> 00:43:03,088
And you'll do what?

525
00:43:05,299 --> 00:43:07,468
Liberate Colombia.

526
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:17,894
Welcome to the Medellín cartel.

527
00:43:34,703 --> 00:43:38,791
The narcos had their army,
but me and Peña had ours, too.

528
00:43:38,999 --> 00:43:41,585
Many Colombians
like Major Horacio Carrillo

529
00:43:41,669 --> 00:43:44,672
were so invested
in the future of their country

530
00:43:44,755 --> 00:43:47,758
that they were ready
to do whatever it took to fix it.

531
00:43:49,968 --> 00:43:54,640
This was a war that would shake
an entire country to its foundations.

532
00:43:54,723 --> 00:43:58,435
And in the carnage...
mine would be shaken as well.

533
00:44:00,979 --> 00:44:02,857
Even my wife, Connie,
wanted to help.

534
00:44:03,064 --> 00:44:06,360
She got a job as a nurse
in a local comuna.

535
00:44:06,443 --> 00:44:09,112
She wanted to make a difference.

536
00:44:09,196 --> 00:44:11,824
I guess she forgot we were in Colombia.

537
00:44:11,907 --> 00:44:15,076
Look, our escolta will drive me
there and back every day.

538
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,663
- Yeah.
- He'll wait outside all day.

539
00:44:17,746 --> 00:44:20,875
You know the last time you were in church
is when we got married.

540
00:44:20,957 --> 00:44:23,126
Well, I'm letting the Lord
back into my life.

541
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:24,294
Hey, stop right here.

542
00:44:33,261 --> 00:44:34,971
Praise God.

543
00:44:44,147 --> 00:44:45,524
Perdón.

544
00:44:48,861 --> 00:44:52,364
I want that escolta watching
every inch of you at that comuna now.

545
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:55,784
Hey, did we leave the door open?

546
00:44:58,370 --> 00:45:00,455
Oh, my God, Steve!

547
00:45:00,539 --> 00:45:02,541
Get back.

548
00:45:12,551 --> 00:45:14,219
You stay right there
and don't move.
