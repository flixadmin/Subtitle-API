1
00:01:09,167 --> 00:01:11,750
THIS FILM IS BASED ON
A TRUE STORY

2
00:01:11,833 --> 00:01:14,500
NAMES, CHARACTERS, AND EVENTS
HAVE BEEN DRAMATIZED

3
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:48,917
Seriously?

4
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:53,042
Isn't it common sense
to drive slowly at night?

5
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:54,333
That's quite a dent.

6
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:57,708
Are you okay?

7
00:02:57,792 --> 00:02:59,417
- Yes, and you?
- I'm fine.

8
00:03:00,042 --> 00:03:01,792
Why did you drive so fast
at night?

9
00:03:03,167 --> 00:03:05,125
- How are the photos?
- Sorry?

10
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:08,250
There's really no need for that.

11
00:03:09,542 --> 00:03:10,792
What are you talking about?

12
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,458
Photos are crucial
when claiming insurance.

13
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:15,417
You had better not
change your story.

14
00:03:15,667 --> 00:03:16,833
It's scratched...

15
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:08,458


16
00:04:12,792 --> 00:04:16,125
Another murder took place
in a land development site

17
00:04:16,417 --> 00:04:18,375
near Cheonan early this morning.

18
00:04:18,917 --> 00:04:21,458
Since last year, many murders
and missing person cases

19
00:04:21,542 --> 00:04:25,125
have been reported all around
the South Chungcheong Province,

20
00:04:25,292 --> 00:04:28,292
but the police
are yet to close the cases...

21
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:31,125
We want to close them too,
you know.

22
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:33,000
We want to close cases,

23
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:37,208
go on vacations,
and get promoted.

24
00:04:41,292 --> 00:04:42,583
Turn off the siren!

25
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,375
No one in this town
gives a damn.

26
00:04:47,667 --> 00:04:50,125
They just couldn't care less.

27
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:53,625
- What a filthy world...
- Tell me about it.

28
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,542
Gosh, look at those thugs.

29
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:01,000
Trash like them
should just die.

30
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:05,458
Where are you going?
We're on a case!

31
00:05:05,542 --> 00:05:07,292
Whatever. Does it look like
we're on a case?

32
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,042
- Tae-seok!
- See you at the scene!

33
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,250
- Can't you even do that?
- I'm sorry.

34
00:05:12,417 --> 00:05:13,458
Seriously.

35
00:05:14,417 --> 00:05:15,458
Please be on your way.
Please go.

36
00:05:15,542 --> 00:05:17,583
- Be on your way. I'm a cop.
- Sir.

37
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,417
I told you
to stay out of my sight.

38
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:22,958
Block the entrance.

39
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:24,583
Step aside.

40
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,833
To what do we owe the pleasure
on this hot day?

41
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,958
Does a cop need permission
from thugs to be here?

42
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:33,708
Sir.

43
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:34,792
Come on, sir!

44
00:05:35,292 --> 00:05:38,417
Come back another time.
Today's a bad day.

45
00:05:39,542 --> 00:05:41,500
It must be one of those days.

46
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:45,250
The roads were jammed
but things aren't better here.

47
00:05:46,042 --> 00:05:47,542
All right, fine.

48
00:05:51,042 --> 00:05:53,583
Here. Now please go away.

49
00:05:57,583 --> 00:06:01,333
You bastard. What do you take
Korean cops for?

50
00:06:01,917 --> 00:06:04,042
How dare you try to bribe me?

51
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,875
GAM ELAND

52
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:09,500
Here you go, fucking jerks.

53
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:13,625
You guys should've
been more careful.

54
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:19,250
How dare gangsters
try to block a cop's way?

55
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,875
Please continue.

56
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:27,917
I hope you win!

57
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:53,958
Boss.

58
00:06:58,792 --> 00:07:00,583
That fucking cop's here.

59
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:04,458
Put it down.

60
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:15,417
- Wrap him up and send him back.
- Yes, Boss.

61
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:23,208
I received 200,000 won
in gift certificates.

62
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:25,417
Our share is ten percent,

63
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:28,708
so your total is 180,000 won.

64
00:07:30,042 --> 00:07:32,000
Who the fuck...

65
00:07:32,542 --> 00:07:33,583
Open it.

66
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:38,333
Salute.

67
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:39,458
Whatever.

68
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:45,792
You're charged with illegal
conversion of gift certificates.

69
00:07:46,042 --> 00:07:47,667
Remain silent

70
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,208
or retain a lawyer if you want.

71
00:07:50,792 --> 00:07:51,833
You're coming with me.

72
00:07:51,917 --> 00:07:55,292
Detective, why don't
you come in for a second?

73
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,583
Buddy, come out here.

74
00:08:00,667 --> 00:08:02,042
Don't forget to put those on.

75
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:07,708
- Good morning, Boss!
- Good morning, Boss!

76
00:08:19,542 --> 00:08:20,583
Yes, it's me.

77
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,000
That bastard's back again.

78
00:08:23,167 --> 00:08:24,208
What?

79
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:28,167
I sent him to a crime scene.
What's he doing there?

80
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,542
Ask the fucker yourself.

81
00:08:33,667 --> 00:08:35,375
Tell Sang-do I'm heading there.

82
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:39,833
You can't do this, not when you
receive our monthly fee.

83
00:08:40,542 --> 00:08:42,250
Taking all the money
for yourself

84
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:45,167
has caused your boys
to disrupt my business.

85
00:08:46,042 --> 00:08:49,417
I already advised you against
gift certificate conversion.

86
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:52,042
Start a currency exchange shop
under someone else's name,

87
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,292
or share the stakes. You know
what I'm talking about.

88
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:57,417
All that for some chump change?

89
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,167
I'm busy as it is
setting up new operations.

90
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:03,292
Can't you cut him off
before he comes over?

91
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,042
My boys need the money.

92
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:07,333
All right, fine.
I'll take care of the bastard.

93
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:20,625
What?

94
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:21,708
Are you kidding me?

95
00:09:21,917 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm your superior, you know.
Where are you?

96
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:26,208
On my way to the crime scene.
I'm hanging up.

97
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,167
I really don't like this guy.

98
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,417
Let me just turn off...

99
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,292
- the electric fan.
- Keep walking.

100
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:38,875
Stop right there.

101
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,417
As you wish.

102
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,042
- Thanks for the ride.
- Thank you.

103
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:55,000
Seriously? Is this necessary?

104
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:58,375
I gave you a ride!

105
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:02,542
Here's my payment.

106
00:10:03,417 --> 00:10:04,708
Now, kneel on the ground!

107
00:10:05,042 --> 00:10:07,958
I'm going to report you.

108
00:10:08,167 --> 00:10:09,792
Bloody traffic jam.

109
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:12,292
Where the heck have you been?

110
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:14,917
Gosh, there's a crowd already.

111
00:10:15,667 --> 00:10:16,708
Get rid of them.

112
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,917
Hello, reporters.
One moment, please!

113
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,417
You can take photos later.
Can you all move back for now?

114
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:28,000
Secure the scene properly!
What have you been doing?

115
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,625
Hey, move aside!

116
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:32,917
Stay back if you were late.

117
00:10:33,917 --> 00:10:37,167
Don't head toward the bridge
and stay close.

118
00:10:38,542 --> 00:10:41,875
I just received a call
requesting for backup.

119
00:10:55,792 --> 00:10:56,833
Move back, please.

120
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,417
People are gathering over there!

121
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,750
We're gaining an audience!

122
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,042
Good day, officer.

123
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:05,833
Did you identify the victim?

124
00:11:05,917 --> 00:11:08,417
We're checking his vehicle
number, so we'll find out soon.

125
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:17,667
He died only a few hours ago

126
00:11:19,292 --> 00:11:21,458
between three and five
this morning.

127
00:11:21,917 --> 00:11:24,333
Cause of death is blood loss
due to stabbing

128
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,917
or a heart attack.

129
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,458
That's my initial impression.

130
00:11:29,042 --> 00:11:30,917
Hey, come and take some photos.

131
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:33,458
Did you get it?

132
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:46,208
Make sure
you don't miss anything.

133
00:11:47,417 --> 00:11:49,458
Hey, Seo-jin. Over here!

134
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:50,833
Can you take a look at this?

135
00:11:51,542 --> 00:11:54,583
I told you not to call me
by name at crime scenes.

136
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:57,708
My apologies, Chief Cha.
Anyway, please take a look.

137
00:11:58,042 --> 00:11:59,083
What is it?

138
00:12:01,042 --> 00:12:02,167
Looks like rear-end collision,
right?

139
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,583
It does seem that way,
but then again, it doesn't.

140
00:12:09,167 --> 00:12:10,875
Could this be the motive?

141
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:13,958
I wish it was. It's better
than premeditated murder.

142
00:12:33,042 --> 00:12:35,208
By the way, I should thank you

143
00:12:35,417 --> 00:12:38,333
for turning one of my boys
into a cripple.

144
00:12:38,542 --> 00:12:40,875
There are rules for a reason,
you know.

145
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:44,917
Whatever.

146
00:12:45,792 --> 00:12:48,583
So businesses will be separate
but we'll share engineers.

147
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Got it.

148
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:54,042
Shouldn't we resolve
the turf issue though?

149
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:55,625
Let's be flexible about this.

150
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:03,750
- Sang-do.
- Yes?

151
00:13:06,042 --> 00:13:08,917
If you keep getting favors,
you'll end up getting spoiled.

152
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:14,542
Don't make trouble, and manage
the shop I assigned you.

153
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:17,542
Everyone has his limit.

154
00:13:18,417 --> 00:13:19,958
If you cross the line,
you'll die.

155
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,875
Come on, do you really think so?

156
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,500
Guus Hiddink once said this.

157
00:13:29,417 --> 00:13:31,667
"I'm still fucking hungry."

158
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,125
I have no capital,
no connections,

159
00:13:36,042 --> 00:13:38,458
so I'm still hungry.

160
00:13:41,917 --> 00:13:42,917
Sir.

161
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:47,042
My boss is being lenient
because you two are friends.

162
00:13:48,167 --> 00:13:51,333
That's why he's giving you
the technology and engineers.

163
00:13:51,792 --> 00:13:53,583
The slot arcade business

164
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:58,750
is nothing like fighting
over these bars and clubs!

165
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:01,208
Are you raising your voice
in front of our bosses?

166
00:14:01,292 --> 00:14:03,875
Give us what?
Just shut up, asshole!

167
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:05,583
Do you have a death wish?

168
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:07,042
Shut the fuck up!

169
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,500
Is this how you train your boys?

170
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,375
Look at him glaring at me.

171
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:15,250
Hey, Dong-su.

172
00:14:16,792 --> 00:14:19,083
Why are you
acting so high and mighty

173
00:14:19,167 --> 00:14:20,542
when all you give me
are only the crumbs?

174
00:14:23,792 --> 00:14:25,792
This type of transaction
won't keep the peace.

175
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,125
Come here.

176
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:38,208
Yes, Boss.

177
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:46,167
You shouldn't
interrupt our conversation.

178
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:47,708
Come here.

179
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,000
You little fucker.

180
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,417
There. Now we can work in peace.

181
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:15,917
Drink up.

182
00:15:22,917 --> 00:15:24,000
It's good.

183
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:28,500
CHEONAN POLICE STATION

184
00:15:29,042 --> 00:15:31,042
Choe Jeong-gyu, 46 years old.

185
00:15:31,167 --> 00:15:34,000
No enemies, debts, lawsuits
or anything like that.

186
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:35,708
The autopsy report was obvious.

187
00:15:36,042 --> 00:15:37,458
He has over
a dozen stab wounds.

188
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,208
The murderer is obviously
an amateur.

189
00:15:39,292 --> 00:15:40,667
He just went nuts.

190
00:15:41,042 --> 00:15:43,833
I don't feel comfortable
calling the culprit an amateur.

191
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:45,750
No evidence was left behind.

192
00:15:46,042 --> 00:15:48,875
No footprints, blood, hairs,
fingerprints, nothing.

193
00:15:49,667 --> 00:15:52,250
Since the wallet's gone,
it could be a robbery.

194
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,292
However, the amount
is too small so...

195
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:56,500
People kill others
for the littlest things.

196
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,042
The meeting's over.
Get the Captain of Unit One.

197
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:00,917
Yes, sir.

198
00:16:05,542 --> 00:16:06,542
I'm here, sir.

199
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,667
This case is likely
a robbery-homicide,

200
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:15,000
so look for anyone
with similar criminal records.

201
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,125
Yes, sir.

202
00:16:16,417 --> 00:16:18,583
You guys, back up Unit One.

203
00:16:20,167 --> 00:16:21,458
Three separate cases,
but one killer.

204
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,542
What cases?

205
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:24,875
Listen.

206
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:28,667
A reservoir in Seosan
on July 15,

207
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:32,375
Boryeong Sunbeach Motel
on July 23,

208
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,583
and then last night's case.

209
00:16:36,042 --> 00:16:38,292
A knife was the murder weapon
in all three cases.

210
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,792
Considering the length
and width of the knife,

211
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:43,750
it could be the same.

212
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,250
No, I'm certain it is.

213
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,125
The suspect is a serial killer.

214
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,792
This isn't the USA, you know.

215
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,208
Gun possession is illegal,
so knives are the most common.

216
00:16:54,042 --> 00:16:55,167
That's nonsense.

217
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,542
There are over
1,000 murders a year.

218
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,375
Going by your logic, half
of them is done by one guy.

219
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:02,500
Are you nuts?

220
00:17:03,417 --> 00:17:06,542
Who are you to mess with
another jurisdiction's cases?

221
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:09,625
Does the killer care
about jurisdiction?

222
00:17:10,542 --> 00:17:13,292
If we don't catch him soon,
we'll be in big trouble.

223
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,875
He's too meticulous
for this to be a random killing.

224
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,250
He could strike again
at any time--

225
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:19,667
This job is too easy for you,
isn't it?

226
00:17:19,917 --> 00:17:21,500
Murder cases aren't a joke.

227
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:23,208
You can't just
jump to conclusions like that!

228
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,292
That's not...

229
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:28,000
These aren't random cases
I'm tying together.

230
00:17:28,542 --> 00:17:30,542
They each happened
about a week apart

231
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:33,042
all around
South Chungcheong Province.

232
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:35,750
No matter how much we think
about it, we're getting nowhere.

233
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:39,125
Then the conclusion's pretty
obvious, isn't it?

234
00:17:40,042 --> 00:17:42,000
Screw your nonsense.

235
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:43,958
Are you so clever that you
decided to raid an arcade

236
00:17:44,042 --> 00:17:46,375
on your way to a crime scene?

237
00:17:47,417 --> 00:17:48,667
Did you have the time do that?

238
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:51,542
Aren't they criminals too?

239
00:17:52,667 --> 00:17:55,333
Gangsters and killers
are the same shit.

240
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:58,667
Jeong Tae-seok, what's wrong
with you?

241
00:17:59,792 --> 00:18:00,875
Hey.

242
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,083
Are you that desperate
to get promoted?

243
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:10,375
Gosh...

244
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:14,833
Yes, that's what I'm after.

245
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:17,750
It's why I want
to catch the killer.

246
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:24,708
The meeting's over, so move it.
Let's get that killer.

247
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,375
I didn't drink, so I'll drive.

248
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:34,167
But, Boss...

249
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,542
Take the boys and head back.

250
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,083
Yes, Boss.

251
00:18:50,167 --> 00:18:51,708
That's correct, Chairman.

252
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:55,458
Sang-do may be a bit rash,
but he's a smart man.

253
00:18:56,167 --> 00:18:57,917
He won't make trouble anymore.

254
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,875
Yes, don't worry.

255
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,917
Have a good night.

256
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,542
I'm sorry.

257
00:19:38,417 --> 00:19:40,167
The road was slippery.

258
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,333
It looks fine. You can just go.

259
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:53,750
Sorry?

260
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:55,875
But I still hit your car.

261
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:57,625
It's fine. You can go.

262
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,667
Are you sure about that?

263
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:02,833
Yes, it's fine.

264
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,083
Son of a bitch!

265
00:20:28,042 --> 00:20:29,167
Damn it!

266
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:32,708
What the hell?

267
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:02,500
Who are you?

268
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:04,917
Come back here!

269
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:48,750
You're all dead!

270
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,167
You assholes!

271
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:57,375
Who's there?

272
00:24:17,417 --> 00:24:19,042
Sang-do didn't send him.

273
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,583
I didn't recognize the attacker.

274
00:24:22,917 --> 00:24:25,000
It was Sang-do, Boss.

275
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:27,042
He's not a member of a gang.

276
00:24:27,792 --> 00:24:30,042
His attack felt purposeless
and empathetic.

277
00:24:30,667 --> 00:24:32,417
It felt different.

278
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,333
Who else would try to attack you

279
00:24:35,417 --> 00:24:36,875
in our line of work?

280
00:24:36,958 --> 00:24:37,958
Give me that.

281
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:44,208
It was too dark
to see properly but...

282
00:24:44,292 --> 00:24:45,875
WHITE SEDAN,
DAEJEON 23XX

283
00:24:46,667 --> 00:24:48,417
- Get out!
- Locate the vehicle.

284
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,417
I told you to be careful,
didn't I?

285
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,875
We're actually friends.

286
00:24:54,625 --> 00:24:56,583
Gosh, sorry to bother you.

287
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,125
The patient looks
damn comfy to me.

288
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:00,375
Who are you?

289
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:02,417
I brought a box of Red Bulls.

290
00:25:02,917 --> 00:25:05,792
Anyway, I heard
you were stabbed recently.

291
00:25:06,542 --> 00:25:08,333
The hospital
reported it to the police.

292
00:25:08,708 --> 00:25:11,708
Well, you must be
quite embarrassed

293
00:25:12,667 --> 00:25:14,458
to have been attacked like that.
You're a thug, after all.

294
00:25:16,208 --> 00:25:18,875
It's not as embarrassing
as being a cop.

295
00:25:19,333 --> 00:25:21,125
Cops are so incompetent

296
00:25:21,542 --> 00:25:24,125
that bad things keep happening
to model citizens.

297
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,333
Unbelievable.

298
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,708
Right, model citizen,
Jang Dong-su,

299
00:25:33,875 --> 00:25:36,542
tell me everything
about last night.

300
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:37,958
I'll catch him for you.

301
00:25:39,417 --> 00:25:41,333
I can probably catch him faster.

302
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:42,708
Really?

303
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,750
Jeez. Do you want to bet?

304
00:25:46,958 --> 00:25:49,417
Spill it, asshole.

305
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,333
Like I said,
I'll catch him for you.

306
00:25:55,042 --> 00:25:57,000
Fine. Do you mind?

307
00:26:01,042 --> 00:26:06,042
I tripped last night
and hurt myself.

308
00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:15,958
Right, okay.

309
00:26:16,917 --> 00:26:18,708
You should really
watch your step.

310
00:26:19,333 --> 00:26:23,750
Unlucky bastards can trip
and fall on multiple knives.

311
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:16,333
Jang's car is a black Mercedes
with the number 3849, right?

312
00:27:20,542 --> 00:27:21,708
Got it, I'll hang up.

313
00:27:28,542 --> 00:27:30,417
Son of a bitch.

314
00:27:32,542 --> 00:27:34,292
A rear-end collision.

315
00:27:35,917 --> 00:27:37,583
White sedan.

316
00:27:39,708 --> 00:27:41,792
I was right, shithead.

317
00:27:43,083 --> 00:27:44,958
WISH YOU A FAST RECOVERY,
HUR SANG-DO

318
00:27:50,958 --> 00:27:54,042
Jeez, look at you.

319
00:27:55,333 --> 00:27:56,375
Are you okay?

320
00:27:57,417 --> 00:27:58,958
- Have a seat.
- I'm fine.

321
00:28:00,167 --> 00:28:02,458
I feel so bad that
I can barely look at you.

322
00:28:06,458 --> 00:28:08,583
What will happen now?

323
00:28:08,833 --> 00:28:12,208
You made a mess right after
we signed the contract.

324
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:14,833
What would you like me to do?

325
00:28:17,708 --> 00:28:19,625
A lot of my boys
are cripples now.

326
00:28:20,375 --> 00:28:22,125
Pay hospital bills
and some compensation.

327
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:24,792
And hand over the main store
and also the one in Seongan.

328
00:28:28,167 --> 00:28:30,458
I'll make sure your boys
are well compensated.

329
00:28:32,042 --> 00:28:33,042
And the shops?

330
00:28:34,667 --> 00:28:36,125
Was this your plan all along?

331
00:28:42,042 --> 00:28:43,125
Dong-su.

332
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:47,708
If I gave the order,

333
00:28:50,333 --> 00:28:51,625
you wouldn't be alive.

334
00:28:53,833 --> 00:28:55,375
Anyway, think about it.

335
00:28:56,667 --> 00:28:58,250
I'm curious too, you know.

336
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:01,250
Who would mess you up like this?

337
00:29:03,292 --> 00:29:04,333
See you then.

338
00:29:04,833 --> 00:29:06,583
So fucking embarrassing!

339
00:29:06,667 --> 00:29:10,167
A gangster getting stabbed?
I'd just kill myself!

340
00:29:13,792 --> 00:29:16,667
Trust me and give me
two men on this case.

341
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:19,250
I'll catch that guy in one go.

342
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:22,000
Why don't you just
go on a vacation?

343
00:29:22,708 --> 00:29:25,000
I barely have enough men
to run this department,

344
00:29:25,208 --> 00:29:27,958
so why are you offering
to take someone else's problem?

345
00:29:28,167 --> 00:29:30,042
Chief, it's a huge case.

346
00:29:30,167 --> 00:29:32,042
If you close one,
others will get solved as well.

347
00:29:32,125 --> 00:29:34,958
It will be a long train
of solved cases.

348
00:29:35,375 --> 00:29:36,667
<i>Piss off!</i>

349
00:29:41,042 --> 00:29:44,500
We finally have a victim
who survived the attack.

350
00:29:46,375 --> 00:29:47,625
Did a witness come forward?

351
00:29:56,458 --> 00:29:57,500
<i>Dang Dong-su.</i>

352
00:29:59,167 --> 00:30:00,292
What? Jang Dong-su?

353
00:30:01,583 --> 00:30:03,875
He was stabbed a few days ago.

354
00:30:04,417 --> 00:30:07,125
A two-hour surgery
barely kept him alive and--

355
00:30:07,208 --> 00:30:08,292
Listen to yourself.

356
00:30:08,375 --> 00:30:10,667
Just think about it
for a second.

357
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,250
What kind of psychotic idiot
would attack a gang leader?

358
00:30:14,333 --> 00:30:16,708
The killer's not involved
with gangs.

359
00:30:17,542 --> 00:30:20,250
I'm sure of it.
It's the serial killer!

360
00:30:20,333 --> 00:30:21,333
Shut it!

361
00:30:23,625 --> 00:30:26,750
This is a gang problem,
I'll assign it to Unit Two.

362
00:30:28,875 --> 00:30:31,417
I'm warning you.
Don't get involved.

363
00:30:32,333 --> 00:30:33,417
Now, get out.

364
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:36,417
Go easy on covering for him.

365
00:30:37,208 --> 00:30:39,333
This isn't the time for that.

366
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:43,375
What did you say?

367
00:30:43,667 --> 00:30:44,792
It's what you've been doing.

368
00:30:45,417 --> 00:30:46,625
You son of a bitch!

369
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:53,833
Let's say you're right.

370
00:30:55,167 --> 00:30:56,792
But Jang is the victim here.

371
00:30:57,042 --> 00:30:58,833
You can't arrest a witness

372
00:30:58,917 --> 00:31:00,875
for not reporting a crime.

373
00:31:00,958 --> 00:31:02,708
How many crimes
has he committed?

374
00:31:04,792 --> 00:31:07,292
We need to bring him in
and have him questioned.

375
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:09,500
He's pissed off
to say the least.

376
00:31:09,708 --> 00:31:12,417
If we don't do anything,
he'll kill the killer.

377
00:31:12,792 --> 00:31:14,458
That'll leave us
with three unsolved cases.

378
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:16,458
How can Jang find the killer?

379
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:18,667
He's a gangster, not a cop.

380
00:31:18,833 --> 00:31:22,375
His men have the resources
to find someone in days.

381
00:31:22,458 --> 00:31:23,792
Also, Jang saw...

382
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,458
the killer's face.

383
00:31:36,708 --> 00:31:37,708
Get out.

384
00:31:38,875 --> 00:31:41,042
You're spewing
a lot of nonsense.

385
00:31:41,958 --> 00:31:43,000
- Get out!
- Jeez.

386
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:59,042
Why don't you talk
to the landlord?

387
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:01,833
Jeez!

388
00:32:02,458 --> 00:32:04,292
What am I supposed to do?

389
00:32:04,375 --> 00:32:06,500
I need to work
in order to earn money!

390
00:32:08,125 --> 00:32:10,292
What? Birthday?

391
00:32:13,958 --> 00:32:15,708
How is that important right now?

392
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:17,792
I'm tired as hell!

393
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,417
I haven't slept in two days,

394
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,292
so don't nag me
about a kid's birthday!

395
00:32:22,167 --> 00:32:23,417
It must be your kid's birthday.

396
00:32:25,833 --> 00:32:26,833
What?

397
00:32:28,708 --> 00:32:30,500
That goddamn kid you mentioned.

398
00:32:41,583 --> 00:32:42,625
Give me that.

399
00:32:48,417 --> 00:32:49,875
Sharp face,

400
00:32:50,458 --> 00:32:53,125
thin cheeks, an angled chin,

401
00:32:55,625 --> 00:32:57,750
and a narrow and long nose.

402
00:33:01,917 --> 00:33:04,500
His lips are big
compared to his nose.

403
00:33:10,958 --> 00:33:12,583
That's pretty close.

404
00:33:21,792 --> 00:33:23,417
Then you shouldn't
have had the kid.

405
00:33:25,292 --> 00:33:26,625
It's not the kid's fault.

406
00:33:32,333 --> 00:33:33,958
Find him before the cops.

407
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:35,458
I understand, Boss.

408
00:34:16,458 --> 00:34:17,750
Hey, where are we?

409
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:20,833
Wait. Who are you?

410
00:34:58,458 --> 00:35:00,042
Block the door!

411
00:35:00,125 --> 00:35:01,583
Don't let them come out!

412
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:06,375
Thank you for your cooperation.

413
00:35:09,208 --> 00:35:12,917
We're cracking down
on illegal slot arcades.

414
00:35:13,167 --> 00:35:15,375
All gamblers should stay put.

415
00:35:16,167 --> 00:35:17,583
So where's the boss?

416
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:20,458
Get him down here!

417
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:28,292
Yeah? Hold on.

418
00:35:32,917 --> 00:35:34,417
Okay, go ahead.

419
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:37,542
Jang Dong-su,
that adorable piece of shit.

420
00:35:37,667 --> 00:35:39,542
He's a scheming bastard.

421
00:35:40,208 --> 00:35:42,667
He meddled with 63 out
of 97 slot machines.

422
00:35:42,958 --> 00:35:45,000
- Should I get a warrant today?
- Hold on,

423
00:35:45,417 --> 00:35:46,792
let me ask him.

424
00:35:48,708 --> 00:35:50,708
So, should I request a warrant?

425
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:52,458
What do you want?

426
00:35:52,875 --> 00:35:54,208
The one who stabbed you.

427
00:35:55,125 --> 00:35:57,875
Tell me everything,
and I'll let this one slide.

428
00:35:59,542 --> 00:36:00,792
What if I don't?

429
00:36:03,417 --> 00:36:05,125
Since you have my boss
on your side,

430
00:36:05,208 --> 00:36:07,333
I'm no use to you, is that it?

431
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:11,458
Listen, Jang Dong-su.

432
00:36:11,708 --> 00:36:12,958
The guy who stabbed you

433
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:15,708
is a serial killer.

434
00:36:18,167 --> 00:36:19,708
He's a bit strange though.

435
00:36:20,542 --> 00:36:22,292
He's different
from other psychos.

436
00:36:23,083 --> 00:36:24,333
And you're the proof.

437
00:36:27,292 --> 00:36:28,667
What the hell
are you talking about?

438
00:36:30,083 --> 00:36:32,667
Why do you think
he messed with you?

439
00:36:40,458 --> 00:36:43,750
Most psychopaths go after girls

440
00:36:43,833 --> 00:36:45,750
or people who are weaker
and smaller than they are.

441
00:36:45,833 --> 00:36:47,708
But the killer
attacks just about anyone.

442
00:36:48,708 --> 00:36:51,208
If we don't find him soon,
more people will die.

443
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,542
What the hell's your problem?

444
00:36:56,542 --> 00:36:59,500
Hand over the information
and do your gangster stuff.

445
00:36:59,583 --> 00:37:01,042
It's a win-win.

446
00:37:01,458 --> 00:37:03,917
I'll catch him,
put him on trial,

447
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,833
and lock him up for good.

448
00:37:08,958 --> 00:37:09,958
Then what?

449
00:37:10,875 --> 00:37:12,708
Nothing. That's how it ends.

450
00:37:14,708 --> 00:37:15,792
That's it?

451
00:37:16,958 --> 00:37:21,167
When the country's biggest
luxury casino is built

452
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:23,667
on the penthouse
of this skyscraper,

453
00:37:24,042 --> 00:37:26,458
this entire area
surrounding our Zeus building

454
00:37:26,542 --> 00:37:29,375
will become the hottest spot
in town--

455
00:37:29,458 --> 00:37:33,208
Cut the crap. I heard
this place's ruined.

456
00:37:33,625 --> 00:37:34,958
Damn it.

457
00:37:37,625 --> 00:37:39,792
Everyone who lined up

458
00:37:39,875 --> 00:37:41,417
for pre-construction units
havelefi.

459
00:37:42,042 --> 00:37:45,750
Naturally, investors
are delaying their funding.

460
00:37:46,667 --> 00:37:50,333
Weird rumors have been flying
since your accident.

461
00:37:51,708 --> 00:37:54,542
The Cheongju region
is another problem too.

462
00:37:54,625 --> 00:37:57,708
Sang-dds boys are moving
into our turf.

463
00:37:58,833 --> 00:38:00,167
What about the punk
who stabbed me?

464
00:38:00,958 --> 00:38:03,167
We found his car

465
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:04,917
on the Sintanjin-bound
national highway.

466
00:38:05,667 --> 00:38:06,667
His car?

467
00:38:07,167 --> 00:38:09,750
It was parked at a rest area
for a few days.

468
00:38:09,958 --> 00:38:11,333
The boys found it.

469
00:38:11,417 --> 00:38:14,167
- Where is the car now?
- We brought it back.

470
00:38:14,833 --> 00:38:17,833
Anyway, there was a murder
a few days ago in that area.

471
00:38:18,708 --> 00:38:22,625
And this. I don't know
if it was dumped or lost,

472
00:38:22,958 --> 00:38:26,250
but the boys found it
about 3km away from the car.

473
00:38:32,167 --> 00:38:33,667
Hold onto it.

474
00:38:34,042 --> 00:38:35,208
Yes, Boss.

475
00:38:41,917 --> 00:38:43,875
- Hello.
- This is Jang Dong-su.

476
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,292
What a surprise.

477
00:38:49,833 --> 00:38:51,625
Do you know
the Sintanjin murder case?

478
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,583
What about it?

479
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:56,292
That bastard did it.

480
00:38:56,958 --> 00:38:58,000
What?

481
00:39:01,458 --> 00:39:02,708
How do you know that?

482
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:07,125
We found his car in the area.

483
00:39:10,917 --> 00:39:12,958
I've been doing quite well
lately.

484
00:39:14,458 --> 00:39:16,750
I got all the way up here
by risking my life.

485
00:39:17,458 --> 00:39:20,917
Then some random guy comes along
and gets in my way.

486
00:39:22,167 --> 00:39:24,708
What other choice do I have
other than cutting him down?

487
00:39:25,083 --> 00:39:26,500
It's not like I can move aside
for him.

488
00:39:26,583 --> 00:39:29,833
But that psycho
disappeared without a trace

489
00:39:30,375 --> 00:39:32,917
after walking all over
a gangster's reputation.

490
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:35,000
Hey,

491
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:38,583
whoever messes with me
has to pay the price.

492
00:39:40,125 --> 00:39:42,583
Reputation is everything
to a gangster.

493
00:39:44,625 --> 00:39:49,833
I'll chop him up
and put him on display.

494
00:39:50,667 --> 00:39:54,208
Are you telling a cop
you'll kill a man?

495
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,125
We punish people
in ways that the law can't.

496
00:39:57,333 --> 00:40:00,292
Are you saying a bad guy
will catch another bad guy?

497
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:01,792
No.

498
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:06,750
Two bad guys will catch
a sicko that's even worse.

499
00:40:11,458 --> 00:40:12,583
Here's his car key.

500
00:40:18,167 --> 00:40:20,417
Do you not see me as a cop?

501
00:40:21,667 --> 00:40:24,375
I can arrest you right away,
you know.

502
00:40:25,625 --> 00:40:27,042
You won't though. Why?

503
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,833
Because you want him
more than I do.

504
00:40:39,417 --> 00:40:43,042
I'll provide manpower
and pay the expenses.

505
00:40:44,417 --> 00:40:45,667
We'll share information

506
00:40:47,042 --> 00:40:48,625
and help each other out.

507
00:40:49,417 --> 00:40:50,500
And the prize?

508
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,583
Do we split him in half?

509
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:55,125
Whoever catches him first
can keep him.

510
00:40:55,875 --> 00:40:59,750
So if I catch him first,
he'll be punished by the law,

511
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:02,583
but if you catch him,
you'll finish him off, right?

512
00:41:03,875 --> 00:41:05,417
Join the game
if you're confident enough.

513
00:41:16,583 --> 00:41:17,625
Count me in.

514
00:41:18,958 --> 00:41:20,917
You'll regret this, you know.

515
00:41:25,792 --> 00:41:26,875
He's a handsome fellow.

516
00:41:28,667 --> 00:41:29,792
How old did he seem?

517
00:41:31,083 --> 00:41:32,750
About mid-30s.

518
00:41:33,333 --> 00:41:35,458
Rain and darkness
obscured my vision, though.

519
00:41:36,333 --> 00:41:38,042
Keep in touch using this.

520
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:45,292
A gangster and cop join forces
to catch the devil.

521
00:41:45,375 --> 00:41:47,875
This is interesting!

522
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:02,125
A gangster and cop join forces
to catch the devil.

523
00:42:02,208 --> 00:42:04,792
This is interesting!

524
00:42:05,458 --> 00:42:06,583
You motherfucker.

525
00:42:06,667 --> 00:42:08,083
We're in the same boat.

526
00:42:08,167 --> 00:42:10,000
I'd be a fool
not to have insurance.

527
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:12,750
It's not like
we can draft a contract, right?

528
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:21,000
So you went to all the trouble
to record me?

529
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:25,917
Fuck!

530
00:42:30,042 --> 00:42:33,292
Did you really think
you could have leverage over me?

531
00:42:36,083 --> 00:42:38,208
This is why I don't trust cops.

532
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:49,583
Unbelievable.

533
00:42:53,833 --> 00:42:55,667
Just because I'm being lenient

534
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:57,667
doesn't mean
you can walk all over me.

535
00:42:58,250 --> 00:42:59,500
Listen, you bastard.

536
00:42:59,833 --> 00:43:03,917
When this is over,
I'll lock you up first, asshole!

537
00:43:08,833 --> 00:43:10,625
He stabbed Jang Dong-su too

538
00:43:11,042 --> 00:43:12,750
and is the culprit
behind the Sintanjin case.

539
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,458
So what does this mean?

540
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:19,083
If things go as planned,
we can close five cases at once.

541
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,958
Mid-30s, male, average height.

542
00:43:24,125 --> 00:43:26,958
Judging from his pattern,
he only kills at night.

543
00:43:27,208 --> 00:43:30,333
He doesn't care whom he kills
and he only uses a knife.

544
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:31,833
It's one or the other.

545
00:43:32,375 --> 00:43:34,958
He has an obsession
or he's always prepared.

546
00:43:36,417 --> 00:43:37,792
There are no other clues so far.

547
00:43:43,417 --> 00:43:44,958
I made a deal with
Detective Jeong.

548
00:43:45,208 --> 00:43:46,333
We'll catch him together.

549
00:43:46,667 --> 00:43:47,958
Obviously,
we won't tell the others.

550
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:49,583
How can we trust cops?

551
00:43:49,667 --> 00:43:51,625
How can we trust gangsters?

552
00:43:51,708 --> 00:43:52,833
Who said anything about trust?

553
00:43:53,417 --> 00:43:55,417
We need manpower
to catch the killer

554
00:43:55,667 --> 00:43:57,958
and this isn't a case
we can handle ourselves.

555
00:43:58,042 --> 00:44:00,667
- Let's get the others involved.
- Then what?

556
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:02,667
The Major Case Squad
will take over,

557
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:06,042
get the media involved,
and have all the glory.

558
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:09,375
That's not all.
The Chief is protecting Jang,

559
00:44:09,458 --> 00:44:11,875
so this is the only way
to solve this case.

560
00:44:12,417 --> 00:44:14,792
The Chief will get into trouble
too.

561
00:44:15,208 --> 00:44:18,708
Jang has seen his face
and has his car.

562
00:44:18,792 --> 00:44:20,833
We can't only rely
on the drawing.

563
00:44:21,292 --> 00:44:23,042
We need fingerprints and DNA.

564
00:44:23,417 --> 00:44:26,333
We'll help the gangsters
find the killer

565
00:44:26,417 --> 00:44:28,167
and move into make the arrest.

566
00:44:28,542 --> 00:44:32,250
I'll use the cops
and throw them away afterward.

567
00:44:43,167 --> 00:44:44,958
We're all
tax-paying citizen too.

568
00:44:45,708 --> 00:44:48,000
Let's get support
from the cops for once.

569
00:44:53,417 --> 00:44:56,125
On the outside, it looks like
an abandoned cold store,

570
00:44:56,542 --> 00:44:59,208
but thousands of slot machines
are built here

571
00:44:59,292 --> 00:45:00,792
and distributed
all over the country.

572
00:45:00,875 --> 00:45:02,042
Sons of bitches.

573
00:45:08,875 --> 00:45:10,583
Jeez.

574
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:12,542
I'm sure there will be
something to find.

575
00:45:12,625 --> 00:45:16,125
Probably his hair, fingerprint,
or even traces of his fart.

576
00:45:16,583 --> 00:45:19,208
We have to find something
no matter what.

577
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:21,042
We'll comb every inch of it.

578
00:45:21,167 --> 00:45:22,625
Okay, let's begin.

579
00:45:24,167 --> 00:45:26,667
We'll leave all the grunt work
to Jang

580
00:45:27,042 --> 00:45:29,667
and go through the cases
that have happened so far.

581
00:45:30,167 --> 00:45:32,833
This is the security footage
from the highway.

582
00:45:33,167 --> 00:45:34,292
Let's go over his pattern.

583
00:45:34,375 --> 00:45:37,958
He used a vehicle
in all the murders so far.

584
00:45:38,375 --> 00:45:40,583
He's always on the move
which makes him harder to catch.

585
00:45:42,083 --> 00:45:44,750
We know of four open cases,
but there has to be more.

586
00:45:44,917 --> 00:45:47,125
Even when dealing
with any other cases,

587
00:45:47,208 --> 00:45:49,500
always consider the possibility
of serial killings.

588
00:45:49,708 --> 00:45:51,333
If you find anything,
report to me right away.

589
00:45:51,833 --> 00:45:53,333
He's a ticking time bomb.

590
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:57,000
He could pop up anywhere,
so check cases in other areas.

591
00:45:57,458 --> 00:45:58,958
Also, make sure you're discreet.

592
00:46:07,667 --> 00:46:10,333
We'll lock up the gangsters
once the case is over.

593
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:11,750
Nice, right?

594
00:46:13,917 --> 00:46:16,083
Ultimately, it's up to us
to catch the killer.

595
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:19,750
Before we do though,
let's take care of Sang-do.

596
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:18,208
Son of a bitch!

597
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:24,583
Are you insane?

598
00:47:25,042 --> 00:47:26,542
What are you doing here?

599
00:47:27,917 --> 00:47:29,292
What the hell do you think?

600
00:47:30,083 --> 00:47:31,250
I was waiting for you.

601
00:47:32,875 --> 00:47:34,208
I think you broke my back.

602
00:47:34,292 --> 00:47:36,208
You shouldn't have surprised me
like that.

603
00:47:36,292 --> 00:47:37,583
I almost had a heart attack.

604
00:47:38,833 --> 00:47:39,875
Give me some.

605
00:47:45,333 --> 00:47:47,958
- Nice.
- Could you look into this?

606
00:47:48,542 --> 00:47:50,417
- It's urgent.
- What is it?

607
00:47:51,542 --> 00:47:54,875
Nothing special.
I found some hair and blood.

608
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:57,458
- Please look into them.
- Jeong Tae-seok.

609
00:47:59,292 --> 00:48:01,625
What's wrong with you?
This isn't like you.

610
00:48:02,667 --> 00:48:03,750
What isn't like me?

611
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,042
It's a filthy world.

612
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:10,333
I ought to get
my hands dirty too.

613
00:48:10,417 --> 00:48:11,750
Right, it is filthy.

614
00:48:27,708 --> 00:48:29,042
He's a weird one.

615
00:48:30,333 --> 00:48:32,125
He left the weapon
for us to see.

616
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:36,167
"Killer is still at large
but cops are clueless.

617
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,875
Incompetent cops."

618
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:44,667
And now,
even a gang leader is dead.

619
00:48:45,417 --> 00:48:47,125
What will you do?

620
00:48:48,375 --> 00:48:49,542
What should we do about this?

621
00:48:49,917 --> 00:48:52,292
Look at you all.
Cat got your tongue?

622
00:48:52,667 --> 00:48:54,042
<i>The Hut Sang-do case...</i>

623
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,833
will be assigned to Unit Two
and they'll investigate it.

624
00:48:58,250 --> 00:48:59,708
Do you still not get it?

625
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:02,625
Stop staring at the monitor

626
00:49:03,542 --> 00:49:04,583
and hit the streets.

627
00:49:05,458 --> 00:49:06,708
Right now!

628
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:10,875
I don't care if it's dog crap,

629
00:49:10,958 --> 00:49:12,667
search and investigate whatever
will help solve the case!

630
00:49:13,792 --> 00:49:16,542
At least try to look
like you give a damn!

631
00:49:16,792 --> 00:49:17,875
Hold your heads high!

632
00:49:18,208 --> 00:49:19,208
Yeah, tell me.

633
00:49:19,292 --> 00:49:21,458
Do you have a death wish?

634
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:23,917
- What is it?
- You said it's nothing special.

635
00:49:24,417 --> 00:49:25,792
I just got the results
on the samples.

636
00:49:26,625 --> 00:49:29,167
- I don't believe this.
- What is it? Tell me.

637
00:49:29,542 --> 00:49:32,292
DNA of the recent
South Chungcheong murder victims

638
00:49:32,375 --> 00:49:34,250
were detected in the samples.

639
00:49:34,333 --> 00:49:35,333
Really?

640
00:49:37,208 --> 00:49:38,333
Is that it?

641
00:49:38,792 --> 00:49:40,333
Was there any unidentified DNA?

642
00:49:40,417 --> 00:49:42,583
- None.
- That doesn't make sense.

643
00:49:43,208 --> 00:49:44,292
Did you run the tests properly?

644
00:49:44,375 --> 00:49:47,167
There was no one else's
but that's not the issue.

645
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:49,792
- Something big happened.
- Hold on a second.

646
00:49:53,625 --> 00:49:54,625
Go ahead.

647
00:49:54,708 --> 00:49:58,083
DNA of the truck driver
and puppy mill owner

648
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:01,208
were all found on the weapon
used in the Hur murder case.

649
00:50:01,292 --> 00:50:02,292
What?

650
00:50:02,375 --> 00:50:03,958
It means one person did it all.

651
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:07,958
It will be officially classified
as a serial killer case.

652
00:50:09,667 --> 00:50:10,667
I've got to go.

653
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:14,875
Jang Dong-su!

654
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:16,917
It was you, wasn't it?

655
00:50:17,917 --> 00:50:18,958
It was you!

656
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:22,708
Sir, I'll have to call you back.

657
00:50:22,792 --> 00:50:24,125
Answer me, motherfucker!

658
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:30,750
- Are you fucking nuts?
- Damn it!

659
00:50:41,625 --> 00:50:42,958
Bastard!

660
00:50:46,958 --> 00:50:48,958
Your idiot's back.

661
00:50:50,417 --> 00:50:51,917
He barges in here
like it's his house.

662
00:50:53,042 --> 00:50:55,042
Who else?
One of your detectives.

663
00:50:55,292 --> 00:50:56,458
Right, we'll talk later.

664
00:50:58,417 --> 00:50:59,583
Damn it.

665
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:03,833
A cop in league with a gangster?
Fuck this world.

666
00:51:04,667 --> 00:51:07,167
Aren't you a cop too?

667
00:51:08,833 --> 00:51:09,833
Aren't you?

668
00:51:13,167 --> 00:51:14,375
Tell me, asshole.

669
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,625
Did you kill Hur Sang-do?

670
00:51:19,833 --> 00:51:21,083
Yes, I killed him.

671
00:51:27,333 --> 00:51:31,083
I blame myself
for trusting a gangster.

672
00:51:33,292 --> 00:51:34,917
You trusted me?

673
00:51:35,833 --> 00:51:37,500
No one would buy that.

674
00:51:38,458 --> 00:51:39,750
Nothing's changed.

675
00:51:40,167 --> 00:51:42,417
We'll still catch
the killer together.

676
00:51:42,708 --> 00:51:43,708
Got it?

677
00:51:47,375 --> 00:51:48,417
When...

678
00:51:50,417 --> 00:51:51,958
this is all over,

679
00:51:52,792 --> 00:51:56,125
I'll investigate you properly.

680
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,417
Whatever.

681
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:08,542
The murder cases in the region
since July this year

682
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:11,167
were found to be killings
of a serial killer...

683
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:14,125
The police were yet
to find any substantial leads...

684
00:52:14,208 --> 00:52:16,958
Major Case Squad
of the South Chungcheong Station

685
00:52:17,375 --> 00:52:20,417
is now working alongside
the Cheonan Police.

686
00:52:20,625 --> 00:52:24,292
The murders were handled
by various regional

687
00:52:24,375 --> 00:52:26,875
police departments, but by
centralizing the investigation

688
00:52:27,292 --> 00:52:32,333
there's new hope
for finally closing the cases.

689
00:52:32,583 --> 00:52:34,667
We wish for these cases
to soon be solved

690
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:36,917
so that the people
can finally find peace again.

691
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
We'll hear more details
from the reporter on site.

692
00:52:40,083 --> 00:52:41,250
You're here early.

693
00:52:41,917 --> 00:52:43,000
<i>Dong-chem.</i>

694
00:52:43,083 --> 00:52:45,542
I'm outside Ace Hotel,
where the murder took place

695
00:52:45,625 --> 00:52:47,167
on September 3.

696
00:52:47,375 --> 00:52:51,750
The victim of this crime
is said to be Hur Sang-do,

697
00:52:52,167 --> 00:52:55,292
who led a gang
in the South Chungcheong region.

698
00:52:55,917 --> 00:52:59,542
He was said to be
in a turf war with...

699
00:52:59,625 --> 00:53:02,792
If you'd handed over the case
from the beginning,

700
00:53:02,875 --> 00:53:04,208
it wouldn't have come to this.

701
00:53:05,333 --> 00:53:07,375
Murder isn't some child's play.

702
00:53:08,292 --> 00:53:11,333
You guys only ruined
the fucking investigation.

703
00:53:12,542 --> 00:53:15,958
Shouldn't you be more polite
if you're on our home ground?

704
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:19,792
Well, I'm not wrong, you prick.

705
00:53:20,292 --> 00:53:21,333
Prick?

706
00:53:21,792 --> 00:53:23,708
Keep talking, you piece of shit.

707
00:53:23,792 --> 00:53:25,250
- What was that?
- Sir!

708
00:53:25,333 --> 00:53:27,500
- Bring it on then!
- Come here!

709
00:53:28,417 --> 00:53:32,167
- Fucker!
- Hey, stop it!

710
00:53:32,583 --> 00:53:38,125
On the knife found
at the scene of Hur's murder,

711
00:53:38,208 --> 00:53:40,875
DNA evidence of other victims
were discovered.

712
00:53:41,333 --> 00:53:45,667
A task force was set up to
investigate not only Hur's case,

713
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:48,333
but other victims' cases
as well, as all the murders

714
00:53:48,417 --> 00:53:51,542
are likely committed
by one killer...

715
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:53,375
But that wasn't my doing.

716
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:56,417
The task force that consists
of the Major Case Squad

717
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:59,250
and Homicide units

718
00:54:00,042 --> 00:54:04,375
will be joined by the country's
top criminal profiler

719
00:54:04,958 --> 00:54:08,583
and forensic experts
from various fields

720
00:54:08,667 --> 00:54:12,375
in order to conduct
a thorough investigation.

721
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:16,583
The police will remain vigilant
as they are expecting

722
00:54:16,792 --> 00:54:20,875
a huge turnout of gangs
at Hur Sang-dds funeral.

723
00:54:32,458 --> 00:54:34,125
I'm surprised to see you here.

724
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:38,958
Of course I came.
He was my friend.

725
00:55:23,417 --> 00:55:25,500
- Hello?
- Get over here right now.

726
00:55:25,917 --> 00:55:27,250
Why should I?

727
00:55:27,333 --> 00:55:29,125
To clean up your
own fucking mess!

728
00:55:29,208 --> 00:55:30,458
Get over here.

729
00:55:44,958 --> 00:55:46,208
I don't think we've met.

730
00:56:00,125 --> 00:56:04,292
HUR WAS KILLED WITH MY KNIFE
BY SOMEONE ELSE

731
00:57:04,958 --> 00:57:07,875
Find something useful
if you wish to catch the guy.

732
00:57:08,125 --> 00:57:11,875
If Major Case Squad gets him
first, we are both fucked.

733
00:57:14,375 --> 00:57:16,375
Is this what you've been doing
your entire life?

734
00:57:17,708 --> 00:57:20,042
I pity your sorry cop's life.

735
00:57:20,875 --> 00:57:23,125
So don't commit any crimes,
you moron.

736
00:57:23,583 --> 00:57:26,292
If people like me aren't around,
you would be out of a job.

737
00:57:26,542 --> 00:57:27,583
That's how life is.

738
00:57:27,667 --> 00:57:29,458
Some commit crimes
and some catch them.

739
00:57:30,292 --> 00:57:32,667
Right, and some get stabbed.

740
00:57:32,958 --> 00:57:34,917
The bastard
attacked me from behind.

741
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:37,833
Still, I took his knife
and got a piece of him too.

742
00:57:37,917 --> 00:57:39,292
Wait, hold it.

743
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:41,875
- What now?
- You stabbed him?

744
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:42,958
I did. Why?

745
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:44,708
I think I found something.

746
00:57:55,583 --> 00:57:56,750
What the hell?

747
00:57:58,625 --> 00:57:59,792
Sons of bitches.

748
00:58:20,625 --> 00:58:22,000
Jang Dong-su, what's going on?

749
00:58:22,708 --> 00:58:24,042
Who are these guys?

750
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:25,333
Punks.

751
00:59:17,667 --> 00:59:18,750
Move!

752
00:59:34,083 --> 00:59:35,125
Get up.

753
00:59:44,708 --> 00:59:46,542
Go to hell, you asshole!

754
01:00:33,833 --> 01:00:35,750
Shit...

755
01:00:40,417 --> 01:00:43,458
Hey! Motherfucker, no!

756
01:00:43,917 --> 01:00:45,083
Fuck!

757
01:00:46,333 --> 01:00:47,500
That's enough.

758
01:00:48,542 --> 01:00:49,708
It's over now.

759
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:52,417
You should go.
I'll clean things up.

760
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:54,833
No, he's fine.

761
01:00:55,083 --> 01:00:57,792
He just bled a lot.

762
01:00:58,042 --> 01:00:59,167
It's just blood...

763
01:00:59,250 --> 01:01:01,333
Get out of here, asshole!

764
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:19,000
Now that there
is enough evidence

765
01:01:19,083 --> 01:01:20,750
to arrest Hur's killer,

766
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,333
the police stated that capturing
the suspect is a matter of time.

767
01:01:24,792 --> 01:01:27,833
Due to the suspect's
limited method of killing

768
01:01:27,917 --> 01:01:30,375
and small hunting ground,
the police are sure...

769
01:01:35,042 --> 01:01:37,417
Honey, where are you?

770
01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:16,167
Are you seriously napping when
something huge has happened?

771
01:02:18,208 --> 01:02:20,083
Wait. What's with his face?

772
01:02:20,667 --> 01:02:21,833
Wake up, you idiot!

773
01:02:23,833 --> 01:02:26,958
What have you been up to lately?

774
01:02:27,958 --> 01:02:29,000
What the...

775
01:02:31,667 --> 01:02:32,792
Where are you going?

776
01:02:33,625 --> 01:02:35,833
Here, take this.
It's a kidnapping case.

777
01:02:36,333 --> 01:02:38,417
Sun-ho's already there,
so get going.

778
01:02:39,042 --> 01:02:41,708
A kidnapping case?
How is that important right now?

779
01:02:41,917 --> 01:02:43,833
We have
a serial killer to catch.

780
01:02:43,917 --> 01:02:45,042
That's enough!

781
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:49,583
Hey.

782
01:02:51,625 --> 01:02:54,292
Can't you see that
Major Case Squad is here?

783
01:02:55,458 --> 01:02:58,542
They're working with Unit One,
so take care of this.

784
01:03:02,125 --> 01:03:06,375
I told you from the start
that this was a serial murder.

785
01:03:07,042 --> 01:03:09,583
But now Major Case Squad
and Unit One have taken over.

786
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,583
What the hell
do they know anyway?

787
01:03:12,458 --> 01:03:14,250
They're clueless jerks!

788
01:03:14,875 --> 01:03:17,292
You shithead.
What did you just say?

789
01:03:17,375 --> 01:03:18,625
Shut up!

790
01:03:22,042 --> 01:03:23,042
Tae-seok.

791
01:03:23,917 --> 01:03:25,167
You insisted
it was serial killing

792
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:26,333
without any evidence.

793
01:03:26,917 --> 01:03:29,167
There was no evidence
or even a witness.

794
01:03:29,417 --> 01:03:30,458
If you were so confident,

795
01:03:30,542 --> 01:03:31,833
you should have caught him
already.

796
01:03:35,667 --> 01:03:36,708
Damn it.

797
01:03:45,458 --> 01:03:48,000
The victim was a prolific CEO.

798
01:03:53,125 --> 01:03:54,167
Tae-seok.

799
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:58,458
You'll find the killer if you
look into his acquaintances,

800
01:03:58,542 --> 01:03:59,542
so get on it.

801
01:04:02,417 --> 01:04:05,292
Did something happen
while you were with Jang?

802
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:07,958
What's with all the scars?

803
01:04:08,708 --> 01:04:09,875
Something happened, right?

804
01:04:11,708 --> 01:04:13,708
Cut the bullshit.

805
01:04:15,792 --> 01:04:18,167
Ask his colleagues
about the women in his life.

806
01:04:19,667 --> 01:04:21,500
How many times does this make?

807
01:04:22,125 --> 01:04:24,125
Why do you keep changing
the meeting spot?

808
01:04:24,708 --> 01:04:26,250
Is he even alive?

809
01:04:26,833 --> 01:04:29,333
If you want the money,
put him on the phone!

810
01:04:31,750 --> 01:04:33,292
This is the last time.

811
01:04:33,417 --> 01:04:35,042
Be at Jeil Snack Bar
in Wolmyeong-dong.

812
01:04:35,667 --> 01:04:36,708
Come right now.

813
01:04:43,958 --> 01:04:47,042
What are you doing?
Go inside already.

814
01:04:47,292 --> 01:04:49,625
Did you come by
to drop off the bag?

815
01:04:50,125 --> 01:04:51,583
- Yes.
- Please leave it with me.

816
01:04:53,542 --> 01:04:56,375
Why is she handing her the cash?

817
01:05:00,208 --> 01:05:01,417
What the hell.

818
01:05:02,417 --> 01:05:06,500
Tell the world you're here
with cops, why don't you?

819
01:05:13,958 --> 01:05:16,500
Hey. Who's that on the roof?

820
01:05:17,125 --> 01:05:18,417
It's him. He's on the roof!

821
01:05:18,750 --> 01:05:21,000
Dong-cheol, he's headed north!

822
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:22,167
Where is he?

823
01:05:23,958 --> 01:05:25,667
Sun-ho, lure him
into the main street!

824
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:26,875
Hey!

825
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:29,792
- Where the hell were you?
- Hey, he's moving away!

826
01:05:30,042 --> 01:05:31,833
Sun-ho, cut him off!

827
01:05:31,917 --> 01:05:32,917
Stop!

828
01:05:34,333 --> 01:05:37,125
- I don't see him!
- What? He's right there!

829
01:05:37,208 --> 01:05:40,667
- The main street!
- Sun-ho, where the hell are you?

830
01:05:44,667 --> 01:05:46,333
Stop, you bastard!

831
01:05:50,625 --> 01:05:51,750
Shit, he's bloody fast.

832
01:05:55,125 --> 01:05:56,417
Stop right there!

833
01:05:59,792 --> 01:06:01,750
- I'll head down!
- Hurry!

834
01:06:04,542 --> 01:06:06,000
I don't see him from here!

835
01:06:06,083 --> 01:06:08,208
- You're dead meat.
- Where did he go?

836
01:06:09,125 --> 01:06:10,292
Catch up when you can.

837
01:06:10,708 --> 01:06:12,833
Up the stairs! Now!

838
01:06:13,875 --> 01:06:14,958
Freeze!

839
01:06:18,042 --> 01:06:20,042
He just turned the corner.
Block him from the front!

840
01:06:20,125 --> 01:06:21,208
Which way did he go?

841
01:06:24,167 --> 01:06:25,292
Over there. That way!

842
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:28,625
Go that way!

843
01:06:39,583 --> 01:06:41,583
Why did you take the bag

844
01:06:41,667 --> 01:06:43,208
when you don't know
what's inside?

845
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:47,167
Why are you shouting at me?
I didn't do anything wrong.

846
01:06:47,417 --> 01:06:49,542
Someone asked me to take it.

847
01:06:50,292 --> 01:06:51,625
Who asked you?

848
01:06:52,042 --> 01:06:54,583
Tell us
or we'll have you arrested.

849
01:06:54,667 --> 01:06:56,417
I've never seen him before.

850
01:06:56,500 --> 01:07:00,167
He ate alone and asked me
to take the bag for him.

851
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,500
He gave me 20 dollars.

852
01:07:11,208 --> 01:07:12,375
What did he look like?

853
01:07:12,958 --> 01:07:15,500
Well, he looked quite average.

854
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,125
Did he only eat food here?

855
01:07:19,125 --> 01:07:21,250
He drank a bottle of soju too!

856
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:25,583
Where's the bottle?

857
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:29,125
The labels differ
depending on the brand,

858
01:07:29,208 --> 01:07:31,875
but they come in
the same bottle.

859
01:07:32,708 --> 01:07:34,417
Have fun searching.

860
01:07:34,917 --> 01:07:36,542
You've got to be kidding me.

861
01:07:41,292 --> 01:07:42,750
<i>- Dong-chem“.
- Yes'?</i>

862
01:07:43,125 --> 01:07:44,375
Just check the relevant brand.

863
01:07:44,458 --> 01:07:46,042
- It's not--
- Just the relevant brand!

864
01:07:46,125 --> 01:07:47,583
This is unbelievable!

865
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:49,583
All the bottles are the same!

866
01:07:52,875 --> 01:07:54,375
There's no need
to work so hard, you know.

867
01:07:55,125 --> 01:07:56,208
Are you serious?

868
01:07:59,375 --> 01:08:01,625
What about
the steering wheel cover?

869
01:08:02,542 --> 01:08:04,042
The result will come out today
at the earliest.

870
01:08:05,833 --> 01:08:09,875
That's why I'll only charge
two million won per machine.

871
01:08:10,833 --> 01:08:11,833
Thank you.

872
01:08:11,958 --> 01:08:14,042
I'll send the technicians
if you need them.

873
01:08:14,167 --> 01:08:16,750
Isn't that too cheap, Mr. Jang?

874
01:08:17,208 --> 01:08:19,458
Of course, your generosity

875
01:08:20,208 --> 01:08:22,208
will make us very happy indeed.

876
01:08:23,208 --> 01:08:27,375
I don't know if I should take
the good deals he offers though.

877
01:08:27,542 --> 01:08:29,375
Look what happened to Sang-do.

878
01:08:30,875 --> 01:08:32,292
Watch out, everyone.

879
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:35,333
After Dong-su got stabbed,
Sang-do was killed,

880
01:08:35,417 --> 01:08:38,292
and his lackey disappeared too.

881
01:08:39,042 --> 01:08:40,833
Just shut up and eat, will you?

882
01:09:06,333 --> 01:09:07,500
What brings you DY?

883
01:09:09,375 --> 01:09:10,625
Look for this guy first.

884
01:09:13,083 --> 01:09:14,625
I found an odd fingerprint.

885
01:09:15,958 --> 01:09:17,667
I don't know if it's damaged.

886
01:09:18,167 --> 01:09:19,875
He could've put something on
his fingers on purpose.

887
01:09:20,333 --> 01:09:22,167
I found him with the partial
prints he left behind.

888
01:09:22,583 --> 01:09:23,792
He's actually a missing person.

889
01:09:24,417 --> 01:09:26,750
His print was found
on the steering wheel cover too.

890
01:09:28,833 --> 01:09:31,042
He hasn't come home
in about three months.

891
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:32,333
Did he say where he was going?

892
01:09:32,417 --> 01:09:35,625
When he's off on a job,
he'd be away for a month.

893
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,750
He's away quite a while
this time though.

894
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,125
I reported it thinking
something had happened to him.

895
01:09:40,667 --> 01:09:41,875
Did he make any trouble?

896
01:09:42,333 --> 01:09:45,583
No, not at all.
He never missed his rent

897
01:09:45,667 --> 01:09:50,292
and never drank any alcohol.
He's a faithful Christian too.

898
01:09:50,875 --> 01:09:52,458
He lives a good, clean life.

899
01:10:01,792 --> 01:10:04,542
BASIS OF MANKIND
WHO RAISED A MONSTER?

900
01:10:04,625 --> 01:10:07,333
NIGHT DARKER THAN DEATH
SACRED VIOLENCE

901
01:10:23,417 --> 01:10:24,917
I found an odd fingerprint.

902
01:10:25,458 --> 01:10:27,167
I don't know if it's damaged.

903
01:10:27,625 --> 01:10:29,333
He could've put something on
his fingers on purpose.

904
01:11:05,417 --> 01:11:07,167
It's 017-684-2784!

905
01:11:07,542 --> 01:11:09,208
Do a background check
on that number.

906
01:11:10,125 --> 01:11:11,958
Also, the recording of
the kidnapper's voice.

907
01:11:12,042 --> 01:11:14,333
Send it to me right away.
Right now!

908
01:11:17,833 --> 01:11:20,625
I heard you paid a ton
for Sang-dds funeral.

909
01:11:21,042 --> 01:11:24,417
Isn't Dong-su one loyal guy?

910
01:11:25,417 --> 01:11:27,250
I hope you
show me the same courtesy.

911
01:11:31,333 --> 01:11:33,250
Didn't I tell you to just eat?

912
01:11:33,333 --> 01:11:36,000
You talk too much.

913
01:11:37,208 --> 01:11:40,500
Why are you ruining
this nice lunch?

914
01:11:40,875 --> 01:11:44,000
I'm looking out
for your fucking interests.

915
01:11:46,333 --> 01:11:47,542
Just eat your food!

916
01:11:54,042 --> 01:11:55,417
Please continue.

917
01:11:57,125 --> 01:11:59,125
I sent you a photo,
so check it right away.

918
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:00,583
Also, listen to this.

919
01:12:03,458 --> 01:12:04,542
This is the last time.

920
01:12:05,708 --> 01:12:07,458
Be at Jeil Snack Bar
in Wolmyeong-dong.

921
01:12:07,833 --> 01:12:08,708
Come right now.

922
01:12:10,208 --> 01:12:11,250
I'm sorry.

923
01:12:12,208 --> 01:12:13,958
The road was slippery.

924
01:12:14,875 --> 01:12:16,708
But I still hit your car.

925
01:12:26,125 --> 01:12:28,333
Name, Kang Gyeong-ho. Age, 35.

926
01:12:29,167 --> 01:12:32,167
He was abused by his father
and grew up in an orphanage.

927
01:12:32,333 --> 01:12:33,500
He has no priors.

928
01:12:33,583 --> 01:12:36,417
He calls his 70-year-old mother
everyday

929
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:37,917
although both use
unlicensed phones.

930
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,792
Until August, his calls were

931
01:12:39,875 --> 01:12:41,375
mainly from
Chungcheong Province,

932
01:12:41,583 --> 01:12:45,500
but he's been calling from
all over the country since then.

933
01:12:45,583 --> 01:12:49,833
We traced his calls
and they were mainly from Ansan,

934
01:12:50,167 --> 01:12:52,250
mostly from this district.

935
01:12:52,542 --> 01:12:53,958
- Daegyeong-dong?
- That's right.

936
01:12:54,042 --> 01:12:55,583
There are a few colleges,

937
01:12:55,667 --> 01:12:57,958
so tons of cheap rooms,
apartments,

938
01:12:58,042 --> 01:13:01,417
and thousands of old houses
are in the neighborhood.

939
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:03,833
What a hassle.

940
01:13:03,917 --> 01:13:05,375
Which means,

941
01:13:06,167 --> 01:13:09,292
he hid here after stabbing Jang.

942
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:11,958
You son of a bitch.
Where are your manners?

943
01:13:12,208 --> 01:13:14,208
Jang? Don't address him
like he's your friend, asshole.

944
01:13:14,292 --> 01:13:15,750
You fucking gangster.

945
01:13:16,792 --> 01:13:19,250
You cops are no different.

946
01:13:21,458 --> 01:13:22,708
Motherfucker!

947
01:13:23,167 --> 01:13:25,167
- Damn it!
- Let go of me!

948
01:13:28,667 --> 01:13:30,000
Do you want to die?

949
01:13:33,458 --> 01:13:34,625
Come here.

950
01:13:43,875 --> 01:13:44,875
Guys.

951
01:13:46,417 --> 01:13:47,750
If we don't catch him,

952
01:13:48,667 --> 01:13:50,750
we're all fucked,
don't you know that?

953
01:13:54,333 --> 01:13:55,958
We're in the same boat now,

954
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,875
so let's see this through
no matter what.

955
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:02,625
Let's just do it, all right?

956
01:14:25,708 --> 01:14:28,167
- Did you all receive the photo?
- Yes, Boss!

957
01:14:28,667 --> 01:14:31,583
As of this moment,
you have one single mission.

958
01:14:32,792 --> 01:14:35,542
Find this fucker at all costs.

959
01:14:35,625 --> 01:14:36,667
- Yes, Boss!
- Yes, Boss!

960
01:14:38,125 --> 01:14:39,958
Keep a low profile,

961
01:14:40,458 --> 01:14:42,583
and if you see anyone
who resembles him,

962
01:14:43,042 --> 01:14:46,000
call your superiors at once.

963
01:14:47,083 --> 01:14:48,667
There will be
five of you in a team.

964
01:14:49,333 --> 01:14:51,167
The team leader will update us
every eight hours,

965
01:14:51,250 --> 01:14:52,458
three times a day.

966
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:07,167
Centering on Daegyeong-dong,

967
01:15:07,625 --> 01:15:10,917
search your designated areas
and keep looking further.

968
01:15:12,042 --> 01:15:15,333
Check cheap motels,
inns, and studio apartments.

969
01:15:16,042 --> 01:15:17,167
I've never seen him before.

970
01:15:17,917 --> 01:15:19,667
Then check short-term renters

971
01:15:19,750 --> 01:15:21,583
as well as
long-term guests at inns.

972
01:15:22,125 --> 01:15:24,208
Search all these places
without fail.

973
01:15:25,292 --> 01:15:26,333
Dean-dong.

974
01:15:29,625 --> 01:15:31,833
In the afternoon,
check the downtown area,

975
01:15:31,917 --> 01:15:35,583
markets, terminals
and other public areas.

976
01:15:43,750 --> 01:15:46,833
At night, head to
bars, arcades, internet cafes,

977
01:15:46,917 --> 01:15:48,583
karaokes, and others.

978
01:15:49,042 --> 01:15:50,625
- Got that?
- Yes, sir!

979
01:15:58,667 --> 01:16:00,375
Check out Jungho-dong as well.

980
01:16:01,458 --> 01:16:02,792
That place closed down!

981
01:16:06,292 --> 01:16:07,333
Damn it.

982
01:16:09,042 --> 01:16:10,208
Shit.

983
01:16:13,792 --> 01:16:16,375
Yes, I'm outside, so hurry up.

984
01:16:17,667 --> 01:16:18,667
Okay.

985
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:20,750
When is the bus coming?

986
01:16:27,958 --> 01:16:29,958
Hey, kid. Come over here.

987
01:16:32,167 --> 01:16:33,333
Take this then.

988
01:16:34,375 --> 01:16:35,917
- I'm fine.
- Take it!

989
01:16:36,417 --> 01:16:38,500
Okay. Thank you.

990
01:16:40,042 --> 01:16:41,917
What about you though?

991
01:16:43,833 --> 01:16:44,958
Study hard.

992
01:16:46,167 --> 01:16:47,292
<i>HEY. Jang Dong-em.!</i>

993
01:16:47,375 --> 01:16:49,792
This isn't the time
to have a team dinner.

994
01:16:49,875 --> 01:16:52,125
You can't keep them working
on an empty stomach.

995
01:16:52,917 --> 01:16:54,042
O-seong will be here soon.

996
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:55,667
Didn't you bring an umbrella?

997
01:16:57,625 --> 01:16:58,667
There.

998
01:17:00,792 --> 01:17:02,250
Don't pretend to be a saint.

999
01:17:02,875 --> 01:17:04,708
- You there!
- Yes?

1000
01:17:04,875 --> 01:17:08,875
You can't receive items
from strangers like that.

1001
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:10,833
He's a thug!

1002
01:17:10,917 --> 01:17:12,708
You seem more like one
if you ask me.

1003
01:17:12,792 --> 01:17:13,833
What?

1004
01:17:14,708 --> 01:17:15,833
DonTlaugh.

1005
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,750
- Bye!
- Be careful, all right?

1006
01:17:19,917 --> 01:17:20,958
Thank you, sir.

1007
01:17:31,625 --> 01:17:35,292
- Our dicks may be many!
- But we have one heart!

1008
01:17:35,375 --> 01:17:38,792
- Until the end of time!
- We are one!

1009
01:17:39,083 --> 01:17:40,917
- Thank you, Boss!
- Thank you, Boss!

1010
01:17:46,333 --> 01:17:50,083
Hearing that
just made my dick tingle.

1011
01:17:50,167 --> 01:17:51,333
What a fucking life.

1012
01:17:51,417 --> 01:17:53,750
I can't believe
I'm in league with you all.

1013
01:17:54,708 --> 01:17:56,625
Just get your job done.

1014
01:17:57,333 --> 01:17:59,292
How is working for a salary
the same

1015
01:17:59,375 --> 01:18:01,750
as risking one's neck every day?

1016
01:18:02,875 --> 01:18:06,208
You're still a fucking thug,
so you can have a drink.

1017
01:18:07,958 --> 01:18:11,542
Just say thank you
when we give you good booze.

1018
01:18:11,625 --> 01:18:14,250
I bring in these liquor,
so drink freely.

1019
01:18:14,333 --> 01:18:17,583
You're involved
in every type of business.

1020
01:18:18,750 --> 01:18:19,958
Do you want to join us?

1021
01:18:21,292 --> 01:18:22,375
Should I?

1022
01:18:23,542 --> 01:18:24,708
You should.

1023
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:29,042
You look the part
and will go far in a gang.

1024
01:18:29,583 --> 01:18:30,958
Shut your face and have a drink.

1025
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:32,625
Fine, pour me one.

1026
01:18:42,125 --> 01:18:44,833
Hey, I wasn't turning away
to show respect or anything.

1027
01:18:46,833 --> 01:18:50,583
Shit. My glass is so greasy.

1028
01:18:51,125 --> 01:18:53,917
Dal-ho! I feel shitty,
so sing me a song.

1029
01:18:54,042 --> 01:18:57,792
Detective, did you know
that I was a boy band trainee?

1030
01:18:58,292 --> 01:19:02,458
I'll sing a kick-ass song
for you all.

1031
01:19:03,083 --> 01:19:05,042
Today in Ansan,

1032
01:19:05,125 --> 01:19:06,792
there was a murder...

1033
01:19:06,875 --> 01:19:09,000
Wait, shut it. Turn that up.

1034
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:13,083
The high school victim
was on her way home

1035
01:19:13,167 --> 01:19:14,958
when she was murdered.

1036
01:19:15,625 --> 01:19:19,333
Considering how young she is,

1037
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:22,917
the police are ruling out
revenge as a motive,

1038
01:19:23,292 --> 01:19:25,375
and leaning towards
a sexual assault

1039
01:19:25,458 --> 01:19:26,625
or a random attack

1040
01:19:26,708 --> 01:19:28,667
as a potential motive...

1041
01:19:28,750 --> 01:19:29,792
O-seong.

1042
01:19:30,167 --> 01:19:32,042
- Get the hell up!
- Yes, Boss!

1043
01:19:32,125 --> 01:19:34,500
Search every unit
along the Bus 32 route.

1044
01:19:34,875 --> 01:19:36,417
What did we miss?

1045
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:38,333
North of Dohwa-dong,
Southwest of Wolpo-dong.

1046
01:19:38,417 --> 01:19:40,000
It's 1km from
the central square!

1047
01:19:40,167 --> 01:19:41,167
Move it!

1048
01:19:41,250 --> 01:19:43,417
He's here somewhere,
so stay focused.

1049
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:44,917
Come up from Daegyeong-dong.

1050
01:19:45,042 --> 01:19:46,542
We'll head down
from Songgeon-dong.

1051
01:19:46,625 --> 01:19:48,333
I'm searching
the central square!

1052
01:19:48,417 --> 01:19:50,333
I think I found him,
It's the Dohwa motel district.

1053
01:19:50,417 --> 01:19:53,125
Gather the boys
and check the cars too.

1054
01:19:53,208 --> 01:19:55,542
Witness found
at the Dohwa motel district.

1055
01:19:55,625 --> 01:19:57,167
Don't just search the motels

1056
01:19:57,250 --> 01:19:59,833
and look into bars
and karaokes too.

1057
01:20:00,042 --> 01:20:01,917
Excuse me, I'm a cop.

1058
01:20:04,167 --> 01:20:05,833
He's staying in Room 304.

1059
01:20:16,250 --> 01:20:17,375
What's going on?

1060
01:20:17,583 --> 01:20:19,667
Tell me! Where is he?

1061
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,625
He left a minute ago.

1062
01:20:21,917 --> 01:20:23,042
Hey, I found him.

1063
01:20:23,167 --> 01:20:25,708
Keep your eyes peeled.
We must get him first.

1064
01:20:25,792 --> 01:20:28,667
Stay in your car
and see if he comes back.

1065
01:20:28,750 --> 01:20:31,458
Don't take any action
and let him walk back here.

1066
01:20:31,542 --> 01:20:32,708
Don't tell me what to do,
you prick.

1067
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,750
Cancel the search party

1068
01:20:36,833 --> 01:20:38,375
and bring
just two more with you here.

1069
01:21:34,083 --> 01:21:35,208
Stay still.

1070
01:22:04,917 --> 01:22:05,958
Get down.

1071
01:22:26,375 --> 01:22:27,792
Nice to meet you again,
little fucker.

1072
01:23:22,667 --> 01:23:23,792
Fucking bastard.

1073
01:23:26,875 --> 01:23:28,250
He drives like a maniac.

1074
01:23:37,667 --> 01:23:38,708
Hey!

1075
01:23:39,542 --> 01:23:40,708
Stop the car, bastard!

1076
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,042
Stop!

1077
01:23:53,917 --> 01:23:54,958
Fuck.

1078
01:23:58,250 --> 01:23:59,375
Stop the car!

1079
01:24:03,125 --> 01:24:04,167
Out of the way!

1080
01:24:17,417 --> 01:24:18,667
Damn them!

1081
01:24:53,917 --> 01:24:55,292
You fucking asshole!

1082
01:24:56,292 --> 01:24:57,458
What was that?

1083
01:25:00,458 --> 01:25:02,167
I was after that bastard!

1084
01:25:03,667 --> 01:25:04,708
Over there.

1085
01:25:05,333 --> 01:25:06,917
Son of a bitch!

1086
01:25:08,083 --> 01:25:09,292
Fucking hell.

1087
01:25:16,292 --> 01:25:17,542
You, go that way.

1088
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,125
Asshole.

1089
01:26:07,042 --> 01:26:08,083
Hey.

1090
01:26:08,750 --> 01:26:09,458
Hey!

1091
01:26:10,333 --> 01:26:11,500
O-seong, no!

1092
01:26:12,125 --> 01:26:13,833
Stay with me, O-seong!

1093
01:26:14,375 --> 01:26:15,917
- O-seong...
- Over there...

1094
01:26:17,042 --> 01:26:18,125
That Way!

1095
01:26:20,958 --> 01:26:22,208
Hurry.

1096
01:26:24,708 --> 01:26:25,750
Damn it.

1097
01:26:34,542 --> 01:26:35,792
PANG PANG KARAOKE

1098
01:28:11,292 --> 01:28:12,583
Where are you?

1099
01:28:12,917 --> 01:28:14,208
This fucker is mine now.

1100
01:28:14,292 --> 01:28:15,708
Where the fuck are you?

1101
01:28:23,500 --> 01:28:25,000
Track down Jang's location!

1102
01:28:25,542 --> 01:28:27,333
He took the killer.
Find him fast!

1103
01:28:34,542 --> 01:28:35,917
Fasten your seat belt.

1104
01:28:36,125 --> 01:28:38,167
You can't die before I kill you.

1105
01:28:39,042 --> 01:28:41,167
- Stop at a rest stop.
- What?

1106
01:28:42,917 --> 01:28:44,083
I'm starving.

1107
01:29:06,625 --> 01:29:07,625
This is fun.

1108
01:29:08,417 --> 01:29:09,958
How are we different?

1109
01:29:14,042 --> 01:29:16,208
That's pretty obvious,
don't you think?

1110
01:29:20,125 --> 01:29:22,583
You shouldn't have stabbed me,
you puny jerk.

1111
01:29:24,917 --> 01:29:26,333
<i>Fucker.</i>

1112
01:29:35,250 --> 01:29:36,333
Isn't it fun

1113
01:29:36,750 --> 01:29:38,875
to play with a man's life?

1114
01:29:44,625 --> 01:29:47,042
He drove down to Cheonan.

1115
01:29:47,208 --> 01:29:48,500
He was caught on camera
at the tollgate.

1116
01:29:48,583 --> 01:29:49,750
Son of a bitch.

1117
01:29:53,625 --> 01:29:55,083
Do you know

1118
01:29:55,583 --> 01:29:57,833
what the most
exhilarating part is?

1119
01:29:58,667 --> 01:30:00,750
Shut the fuck up.

1120
01:30:05,917 --> 01:30:07,250
Do you like minced meat?

1121
01:30:09,292 --> 01:30:12,042
I'm going to chop you up nicely

1122
01:30:13,083 --> 01:30:15,042
and spray your guts everywhere.

1123
01:30:15,875 --> 01:30:17,125
Motherfucker.

1124
01:30:18,875 --> 01:30:20,042
It's this moment.

1125
01:30:21,125 --> 01:30:25,125
When life and death
is in your hands.

1126
01:30:25,667 --> 01:30:27,125
Give it a go.

1127
01:30:28,458 --> 01:30:29,583
Get on with it.

1128
01:30:30,375 --> 01:30:31,750
Kill me!

1129
01:30:34,125 --> 01:30:36,917
Do you even listen to yourself?

1130
01:30:38,625 --> 01:30:42,125
Did you think you'd live
after killing all those people?

1131
01:30:42,417 --> 01:30:44,250
That's why you should kill me.

1132
01:30:46,542 --> 01:30:49,500
Try to stay still. I'd rather
not get your blood on me.

1133
01:31:14,917 --> 01:31:16,208
Shit.

1134
01:31:31,667 --> 01:31:33,083
Sorry, buddy,

1135
01:31:35,542 --> 01:31:37,167
but I'm still a cop.

1136
01:31:57,375 --> 01:31:59,208
Nice to meet you, asshole.

1137
01:32:02,958 --> 01:32:07,792
Kang Gyeong-ho, you're
under arrest for homicide.

1138
01:32:13,250 --> 01:32:15,125
Even a devil like you

1139
01:32:16,542 --> 01:32:18,292
can retain an attorney

1140
01:32:19,292 --> 01:32:22,042
and have the right
to remain silent.

1141
01:32:23,125 --> 01:32:25,833
Anything you say can be used

1142
01:32:27,083 --> 01:32:29,458
against you in a court of law.

1143
01:32:31,417 --> 01:32:33,625
If you cannot afford
an attorney,

1144
01:32:34,333 --> 01:32:36,167
one will be appointed to you
in courtesy of

1145
01:32:36,250 --> 01:32:39,458
this nation's taxpayers,
you asshole.

1146
01:32:55,333 --> 01:32:58,167
- What the hell?
- Isn't it obvious?

1147
01:32:58,917 --> 01:33:00,667
He's the serial killer.

1148
01:33:01,458 --> 01:33:02,500
Come here.

1149
01:33:04,708 --> 01:33:05,833
What are you staring at?

1150
01:33:06,292 --> 01:33:07,333
Go home!

1151
01:33:07,875 --> 01:33:09,208
Pack up!

1152
01:33:11,167 --> 01:33:12,417
Come here, you psycho.

1153
01:33:14,333 --> 01:33:16,292
- One moment, please!
- Make way!

1154
01:33:16,375 --> 01:33:18,250
- Let us through.
- Make way!

1155
01:33:18,333 --> 01:33:22,333
While investigating a kidnapping
case from September,

1156
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:27,083
the Cheonan Police obtained
key evidence that led to Kang.

1157
01:33:27,417 --> 01:33:30,583
He's currently being treated
for minor injuries,

1158
01:33:30,667 --> 01:33:32,417
and he'll be investigated
by the police

1159
01:33:32,500 --> 01:33:36,208
before being handed over
to the prosecutor.

1160
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:37,542
Let's move on.

1161
01:33:37,625 --> 01:33:41,792
Slot arcades are becoming
a social issue as of late.

1162
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,417
The prosecution traced

1163
01:33:44,500 --> 01:33:46,958
how these arcades
are funding gangsters

1164
01:33:47,333 --> 01:33:51,500
and is currently after
Zeus'gangleaderJang.

1165
01:33:52,042 --> 01:33:55,083
Jang who operates
several dozen slot arcades

1166
01:33:55,542 --> 01:33:58,917
has made a fortune
by illegally modifying

1167
01:33:59,250 --> 01:34:01,500
and distributing
arcade machines.

1168
01:34:01,792 --> 01:34:05,167
However, his current
whereabouts are unknown.

1169
01:34:08,333 --> 01:34:09,583
This is all your doing,
isn't it?

1170
01:34:11,333 --> 01:34:12,375
No.

1171
01:34:12,458 --> 01:34:15,417
You convinced the world
that he's the killer,

1172
01:34:16,250 --> 01:34:17,208
but now there's no evidence?

1173
01:34:17,292 --> 01:34:19,917
Everything we have on him
is circumstantial.

1174
01:34:20,792 --> 01:34:22,625
Nothing directly ties him
to the murders.

1175
01:34:22,708 --> 01:34:24,417
Even if I were the judge,

1176
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:26,583
I wouldn't
give him the death penalty.

1177
01:34:30,917 --> 01:34:32,625
- What's this?
- A knife.

1178
01:34:33,292 --> 01:34:36,667
Yes, one you used
to murder all those people.

1179
01:34:39,333 --> 01:34:40,792
What has been
your concept in life?

1180
01:34:41,667 --> 01:34:44,250
I just can't figure you out.
Do you know why?

1181
01:34:46,250 --> 01:34:47,750
It's because you're not human.

1182
01:34:48,167 --> 01:34:49,708
Then what's yours?

1183
01:34:51,958 --> 01:34:54,667
A good cop? A model citizen?

1184
01:34:56,500 --> 01:34:57,708
You can't answer me, can you?

1185
01:34:58,500 --> 01:35:01,042
Who lives their life
by following a concept?

1186
01:35:02,125 --> 01:35:05,125
We live because we do.

1187
01:35:08,208 --> 01:35:10,000
I wore gloves for my first kill,

1188
01:35:10,375 --> 01:35:13,333
but I couldn't grip
anything properly with them on.

1189
01:35:13,875 --> 01:35:15,750
Each stab should
always be clean.

1190
01:35:17,542 --> 01:35:19,250
That feeling when it goes in?

1191
01:35:19,958 --> 01:35:22,000
You can feel it
from the tips of your fingers.

1192
01:35:23,208 --> 01:35:25,000
I guess
it's something like that.

1193
01:35:26,917 --> 01:35:28,125
And these photos?

1194
01:35:40,125 --> 01:35:41,208
What is it?

1195
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:43,792
The order's all wrong.

1196
01:35:46,833 --> 01:35:49,792
Besides, how can you say
that these are mine?

1197
01:35:51,833 --> 01:35:55,500
And even if I get
the death penalty,

1198
01:35:56,875 --> 01:35:58,292
you know I won't die.

1199
01:35:59,333 --> 01:36:00,417
You little bastard.

1200
01:36:01,125 --> 01:36:02,542
- I'll kill you!.
- Hey, stop!

1201
01:36:02,625 --> 01:36:03,667
Stop it!

1202
01:36:03,750 --> 01:36:06,417
- Come here. I'll kill you!
- Stop it!

1203
01:36:06,500 --> 01:36:08,000
Don't do it!

1204
01:36:11,333 --> 01:36:15,083
If you sentence me to death
without proper evidence,

1205
01:36:16,708 --> 01:36:18,458
then that's murder.

1206
01:36:18,917 --> 01:36:23,583
The real devils are those who
commit crimes with kind faces.

1207
01:36:24,458 --> 01:36:27,083
Think about it as creators
and enforcers of the law.

1208
01:36:27,167 --> 01:36:29,458
Do you really have that right?

1209
01:36:30,833 --> 01:36:32,542
If you're innocent,

1210
01:36:34,167 --> 01:36:36,208
then I am too.

1211
01:36:46,417 --> 01:36:48,167
Did you state that
you've never seen this knife?

1212
01:36:50,708 --> 01:36:51,750
I did.

1213
01:36:51,833 --> 01:36:55,792
This knife was used
to kill five victims

1214
01:36:56,042 --> 01:36:58,167
between July
and September of 2005.

1215
01:36:58,250 --> 01:36:59,667
Objection, Your Honor.

1216
01:37:00,042 --> 01:37:02,167
The prosecution has not provided
any concrete link

1217
01:37:02,250 --> 01:37:05,583
between the knife
and my client during this trial.

1218
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,375
It cannot be concluded
that the knife belonged to him.

1219
01:37:08,458 --> 01:37:09,500
Yes, you're right.

1220
01:37:10,917 --> 01:37:13,167
This knife has nothing to do
with the defendant...

1221
01:37:13,875 --> 01:37:15,208
at least until now.

1222
01:37:16,333 --> 01:37:20,750
Your Honor, we'd like
to request a sole survivor

1223
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:26,208
of Kang's vicious knife attack
as the state's next witness.

1224
01:37:26,833 --> 01:37:29,208
Witness, please take the stand.

1225
01:37:55,667 --> 01:37:58,375
You've got balls showing
your face in front of me.

1226
01:37:58,542 --> 01:38:00,167
Damn, you look terrible.

1227
01:38:04,458 --> 01:38:08,500
We pay tax so that you can
arrest and kill those fuckers.

1228
01:38:08,583 --> 01:38:11,250
That's how the law is.

1229
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,542
It arrests people
and punishes them,

1230
01:38:14,625 --> 01:38:17,875
but it also fucking protects us.
That's what it's there for.

1231
01:38:17,958 --> 01:38:20,958
Shut the fuck up.
You should've let me kill him!

1232
01:38:25,375 --> 01:38:28,167
You're my last resort.

1233
01:38:28,875 --> 01:38:32,125
Let's use the law
to kill the bastard.

1234
01:38:34,667 --> 01:38:36,167
Stop your bullshit.

1235
01:38:44,458 --> 01:38:45,500
Turn yourself in.

1236
01:38:45,750 --> 01:38:48,417
Are you out
of your fucking mind?

1237
01:38:52,208 --> 01:38:54,875
- Did you kill Hur Sang-do?
- Yes, I did.

1238
01:38:56,625 --> 01:38:59,083
- Yes, I did.
- Bastard!

1239
01:39:00,208 --> 01:39:03,542
Once this goes public,
you and I are both screwed.

1240
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:07,333
Don't force me to use this.
All right?

1241
01:39:08,333 --> 01:39:09,542
Surrender and become a witness.

1242
01:39:10,125 --> 01:39:11,458
You're the only witness.

1243
01:39:11,750 --> 01:39:13,833
With you on the witness stand,

1244
01:39:13,917 --> 01:39:15,708
I can link him
to all the murders!

1245
01:39:16,917 --> 01:39:17,958
I'd rather...

1246
01:39:19,458 --> 01:39:20,500
just get screwed together.

1247
01:39:21,792 --> 01:39:25,083
I swear that the evidence that
I shall give shall be the truth,

1248
01:39:25,583 --> 01:39:28,708
the whole truth, and nothing
but the truth, so help me God.

1249
01:39:33,083 --> 01:39:34,125
Your Honor.

1250
01:39:34,500 --> 01:39:36,750
The prosecution's witness is
a wanted head of a gang

1251
01:39:36,833 --> 01:39:38,500
who is accused
of several serious crimes

1252
01:39:38,583 --> 01:39:41,583
including illegal gambling
as well as embezzlement.

1253
01:39:41,667 --> 01:39:44,125
Nothing in the law states that

1254
01:39:44,208 --> 01:39:46,958
a criminal suspect
can't testify in another case.

1255
01:39:47,292 --> 01:39:48,292
Iaccept

1256
01:39:48,833 --> 01:39:49,875
Witness,

1257
01:39:50,208 --> 01:39:54,792
how can you verify that you
were stabbed by the defendant?

1258
01:40:03,250 --> 01:40:05,625
Guys like me
who get stabbed regularly

1259
01:40:06,458 --> 01:40:09,625
don't forget our attackers
until the day we die.

1260
01:40:11,250 --> 01:40:13,208
That bastard was the one.

1261
01:40:14,625 --> 01:40:15,667
Here.

1262
01:40:16,500 --> 01:40:21,792
I had this sketch composited
right after I was stabbed.

1263
01:40:25,125 --> 01:40:27,083
Your Honor,
that is simply a drawing

1264
01:40:27,167 --> 01:40:29,875
one drew in
his or her free time.

1265
01:40:29,958 --> 01:40:31,958
It has no legal ground and
cannot be proved scientifically

1266
01:40:32,042 --> 01:40:34,125
and therefore cannot be
admitted as evidence.

1267
01:40:34,208 --> 01:40:35,292
Your Honor,

1268
01:40:35,792 --> 01:40:39,542
this is the witness'
medical record from the hospital

1269
01:40:40,167 --> 01:40:42,167
stating his condition
immediately after the attack.

1270
01:40:42,583 --> 01:40:44,208
The witness is a gang leader.

1271
01:40:44,375 --> 01:40:47,250
Getting stabbed
is normal for him.

1272
01:40:47,583 --> 01:40:49,500
How can that be evidence

1273
01:40:49,583 --> 01:40:50,917
when he could've been
stabbed by someone else?

1274
01:40:51,375 --> 01:40:53,583
He's violating
the defendant's rights

1275
01:40:53,667 --> 01:40:55,292
and is mocking this court!

1276
01:40:55,375 --> 01:40:57,208
Damn, that fucker talks a lot.

1277
01:40:58,208 --> 01:40:59,500
- Hey, Mr. Attorney.
- Witness!

1278
01:41:00,208 --> 01:41:02,208
Would you be able to say that

1279
01:41:02,292 --> 01:41:03,708
if your family
was killed by him?

1280
01:41:04,292 --> 01:41:07,625
The defendant's right?
Nutjobs don't deserve that.

1281
01:41:08,042 --> 01:41:11,083
That fucker
killed people for fun.

1282
01:41:11,792 --> 01:41:15,042
I'm not decent myself,
but he doesn't deserve to live.

1283
01:41:15,917 --> 01:41:16,917
Evidence?

1284
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:19,292
I'll show you the evidence.

1285
01:41:30,167 --> 01:41:34,708
That night, he forced me out
of my car by crashing into it.

1286
01:41:34,917 --> 01:41:37,833
Then he stabbed me twice
in my side.

1287
01:41:38,667 --> 01:41:41,417
During the struggle,
he stabbed me in the chest.

1288
01:41:41,500 --> 01:41:45,625
I also cut my fingers trying
to grab his knife. See?

1289
01:41:47,667 --> 01:41:50,125
If I were the average man,
I'd be dead too.

1290
01:41:51,875 --> 01:41:53,958
You should have him
take his clothes off too.

1291
01:41:54,333 --> 01:41:57,625
I stabbed his left chest,
so there will be a wound.

1292
01:42:05,208 --> 01:42:08,333
Also check his hands.
You'll find a lot of scars.

1293
01:42:08,583 --> 01:42:09,792
Stabbing is a tricky job,

1294
01:42:09,875 --> 01:42:11,833
so you cut yourself
here and there.

1295
01:42:12,083 --> 01:42:13,625
Your nails get broken too.

1296
01:42:15,500 --> 01:42:16,750
And lastly,

1297
01:42:20,750 --> 01:42:22,417
that fucker wrote this.

1298
01:42:24,917 --> 01:42:26,958
Analyze his handwriting,
and you'll get a match.

1299
01:42:28,292 --> 01:42:30,542
<i>For reference,
Hut Sang-do was my mend.</i>

1300
01:42:30,625 --> 01:42:33,125
HUR WAS KILLED WITH MY KNIFE

1301
01:42:34,292 --> 01:42:37,042
Hur and his lieutenant
are both dead.

1302
01:42:37,375 --> 01:42:39,083
I feel bad for O-seong,

1303
01:42:39,833 --> 01:42:41,583
but if Kang spills everything,

1304
01:42:41,917 --> 01:42:43,792
we can blame O-seong for it.

1305
01:42:45,875 --> 01:42:48,000
HUR WAS KILLED WITH MY KNIFE
BY SOMEONE ELSE

1306
01:42:50,250 --> 01:42:52,708
HUR WAS KILLED WITH MY KNIFE

1307
01:42:52,917 --> 01:42:57,458
Considering the defendant's
extremely violent tendencies,

1308
01:42:58,292 --> 01:43:01,583
wanton disregard for human life,

1309
01:43:02,333 --> 01:43:04,375
and the pain
suffered by the victims,

1310
01:43:05,125 --> 01:43:11,125
his sentence was decided
by weighing all the offenses.

1311
01:43:11,875 --> 01:43:14,750
Ergo, defendant Kang Gyeong-ho

1312
01:43:17,083 --> 01:43:18,375
is sentenced to death.

1313
01:43:24,875 --> 01:43:26,458
61ST POLICE APPRECIATION DAY

1314
01:43:27,792 --> 01:43:28,792
Thank you, sir!

1315
01:43:29,167 --> 01:43:30,208
About-face!

1316
01:43:32,083 --> 01:43:33,208
Salute!

1317
01:43:51,333 --> 01:43:54,458
Boss is coming! Let's greet him!

1318
01:43:55,500 --> 01:43:56,875
- Good afternoon, Boss!
- Good afternoon, Boss!

1319
01:44:57,750 --> 01:44:59,958
- Only on one condition.
- Which is what?

1320
01:45:00,958 --> 01:45:03,375
Have me locked up
in the same prison.

1321
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,333
Three men played the game
with their necks on the line.

1322
01:45:32,625 --> 01:45:33,833
It should damn well be finished.

1323
01:45:46,417 --> 01:45:50,542


1324
01:45:52,500 --> 01:45:57,792
DON LEE aka MA DONG SEOK

1325
01:45:57,833 --> 01:46:02,792

1326
