[Zari] <i>Previously on</i>
Legends Of Tomorrow...

00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,599
I couldn't send Neron to hell
without sending Des down with him.

John, you have to stop this.

00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,800
If Desmond isn't dragged to hell,
and you don't join the Legends,

I really care about you.

This thing between us,
it isn't real, it never was.

Uh...

11
00:00:26,441 --> 00:00:28,921
- [Charlie] What's that?
- [Zari] I think John just broke time.

00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,194
Oi, Z, check this out.

13
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,480

Zari?

Constantine did it! He changed
the timeline back in New Orleans.

17
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,396
He saved old Des.

- Oh, quit your whinging.

22
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,513
I know it's a pretty raw deal for you,

23
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,639
especially 'cause, well,
who knows what they put in cat food.

24
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,352
On the plus side, you are cute as hell.
[chuckles]

25
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,437
Z, it has been an experience.

26
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,112
Now, I'm gonna set the autopilot
to take you back to the <i>Waverider.</i>

Hello, Red.

Ms. Monroe. How's Lady Luck treating ya?

Ooh! [chuckles softly]

What are you doing here?

39
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,916
I haven't seen you since
we escaped from that prison.

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,673
Yeah. Hey, listen, mate.

41
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,960
You gotta stop
doing your leprechaun magic

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,600
so out in the open like this, all right?

43
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,396
I do this all the time. These humans,
they don't notice anything.

44
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,600
Watch.

- Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

- Quit doing that.
- But I'm just having a little fun!

47
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,753
What's got you so worried?
The magic police?

48
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,960
They're called the Legends

49
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,376
and I'm just trying to stay
off their radar for a little while.

50
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,880
Sounds to me like you're scared.

What, of them?

52
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,056
[chuckles] No. They're not dangerous,

53
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,595

Oh, my God! Why did you do that?

65
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,879
Marilyn Monroe! I am killing it
at historical-figure bingo.

66
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,559
All right, everyone, calm down.

67
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,917
We just saved your butts from
a very dangerous magical creature.

68
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,989
Who are you guys?

Hi. Nate Heywood, monster hunter.

00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,976
Just want you ladies to know
you're in good hands.

Man, Garima is gonna flip when she
hears we met Marilyn Monroe.

76
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,392
You think a murderous alien queen

77
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,995
that sprang to life from
Mick's fantasies is into Marilyn?

78
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,080
Yes.

79
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,080
Hmm.

80
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,152
What is up with these guys?

81
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,429
Gideon, any messages while we were gone?

82
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,200
[Gideon] You missed calls
from Barry Allen,

83
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,913
Oliver Queen and Kara Zor-El.

84
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,754
Sounds like the annual crossover.

85
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,358
Ugh! Yeah, that's gonna be a hard pass.

86

[cat meows]

Oh, Zari.

89
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,835
Well, I'm glad to see that
you made it back to the ship okay.

90
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,920
[yowls]

91
00:04:40,921 --> 00:04:43,833
[sighs] Okay, I hear you.
You're still mad at me.

92
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,716
Listen. I really need your help.

93
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,800
[meows]

94
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,669
All right, yeah. I can see that being
a cat is your main concern right now,

95
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,197
but I still don't know why you're a cat.

96
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,759
Ms. Tomaz was turned into a cat

97
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,877
during the team's encounter
with a Fairy Godmother.

98
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,795
Whoa, Gideon.
Your latest upgrade is smoking.

99
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,320
Thank you, Miss Jiwe.

100
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,520
Amaya Jiwe. Yeah. That's me.

101
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,119
And may I say, your new upgrade
and accent are also smoking.

102
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,240
- Oh, Yeah?
- [Gideon] Mm-hmm.

103
00:05:12,241 --> 00:05:13,577
You know, I'm just trying something out.

104
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,600
[meows]

105
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,793
Yeah, okay. One last question.

106
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,952
Why are the Legends
homicidal wankers now?

107
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,280
If you're referring to
the Custodians of the Chronology,

108
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,398
their policy toward magical creatures
has been "shoot on sight"

109
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,752
since their disastrous
encounter at Woodstock.

110
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,038
Right. Thanks, Gideon.

111
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,958
Must be fallout from
Constantine altering the timeline.

112
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,959
Right. This zero-tolerance bollocks
ends now.

113
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,113
Hey, people!

114
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,677
I have an announcement to make.

115
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,718
Please, gather around.

116
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Come listen.

117
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,280
So, I know our "shoot first,
ask questions never" policy

118
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,994
has led to some

119
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,720
interesting decorations,
but it's time to change.

120
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,635
From now on, we are going to
capture the magical creatures

121
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,360
and bring them to the Bureau
like we are supposed to.

122
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,796
Why are you looking at me weird?

123
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,756
Well, it just seems like a shame
to change our policy now.

124
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,914
Considering we're so close
to capturing our white whale.

125
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,680
That's a <i>Moby Dick</i> reference.

126
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,314
And what is your white whale?

127
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,520
The only creature we haven't
been able to capture

128
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,632
because it's quite elusive.

129
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,960
Maybe because it has
the ability to change shape!

130
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,040
- Shapeshifter!
- How dare you step on this ship

131
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,554
and pretend to be our dead captain.

132
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,510
What?

133
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,157
- Wait. Sara's dead?
- Yeah.

134
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,959
That's why we know you're not Sara.

135
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,080
- Is that why you guys are like this?
- Like what?

136
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,480
Hunting down magical creatures
like it's a... [groans]

137
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,397
- [laughs]
- [Mick] Yes!

138
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,480
[grunts]

139
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,670
Damn it, Garima!

140
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,840
I called dibs on killing
the shapeshifter last week!

141
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,396
[groans]

142
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,790
You know what, he did.

143
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,754
Remember when we were
roasting that little baby gryphon?

144
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,479
Which was delicious, by the way.

145
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,040
But you guys got into an argument

146
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,476
about who actually killed it,
so, then Ray got upset.

147
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,520
He was like,
"Hey, I wanna kill the shapeshifter."

148
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,794
It heals itself. It turns into Amaya.
This is not good!

149
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,520
- Kill her again!
- I get to kill her this time!

150
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,596
After her!

151
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,720
[Zari meows]

152
00:07:21,721 --> 00:07:22,757
Zari?

153
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,280
Oh, bollocks.

154
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,559
[sighs] They've become maniacs.

155
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,916
Okay, this is bad.

[meows]

157
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,278
What, Constantine? Yes!

158
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,512
This is his fault.
He needs to help us fix this.

159
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,795
But where is he?

160
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,434
[beeping]

161
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,915
[sighs] Nice work, Zari Cat.

162
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,436
[growls softly]

163
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,637
Can't very well walk
around here looking like this.

164
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,990
[Zari meows]

165
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,437
Oh, hush. It's still me,
despite the insane grin on my face.

166
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,115
[sighs]

167
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,029
I don't remember
there being a memorial here.

168
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,473
"Sara Lance. Struck down by a unicorn."

169
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,400
Bollocks.

170
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,233
Gary, you're late.

171
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,033
Uh, sorry, Mr. Heywood.

172
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,800
My cat-sitter quit on me, so...

173
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,151
This place is going to hell
in a handbasket.

174
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,390
Yeah, it's my bad, sir.

175
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,676
Look, the Custodians of the Chronology

176
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,190
just destroyed a freaking leprechaun,
all right?

177
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,794
You know what? If you see them,

178
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,315
tell them they're getting
a scream-down from me.

179
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,359
One more thing, Mr. Heywood.

180
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,955
Have you seen
John Constantine around?

181
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,200
Is that a joke?

182
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,755
He's been in confinement for months!
You put him there.

183
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,560
Idiots!

184
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,555
This isn't the "when"
when I'm supposed to be. [grunts]

185
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,554
[Desmond] <i>Johnny... Johnny...</i>

186
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,836
[screaming]

187
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,776
[Constantine] <i>No, the truth is
not the truth, all right?</i>

188
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,111
This is not the "when"
when I'm supposed to be.

189
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,476
[Desmond] <i>You should go.
This was real, Johnny.</i>

190
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,920
Reality is fractured,

191
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,476
but the pieces,
they speak to each other,

192
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,513
like light between broken mirrors.

193
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,514
John Constantine.

194
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:51,232
Confined for becoming dangerously
unstable after suspected time crimes.

195
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,154
Are you real? Do you exist? Because
it's really hard to tell these days.

196
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,278
Yeah, bloke's gone cuckoo.

197
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,680
[Constantine sighs]

198
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,360
Ha!

199
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,553
I sense a familiar face.

200
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,517
- Who is that? Z?
- [meows]

201
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,870
Z, is that you?

202
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,600
Why the transmogrification?
Let's get this sorted out.

203
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
- [growls]
- Ooh!

204
00:10:13,001 --> 00:10:14,321
Yeah, all right, I'm sorry,

205
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:18,030
but this is the only way
that you will know your true self.

206
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,671
[chanting]

207
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,118
Oh, finally.

208
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,158
[coughing hoarsely]

209
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,676
Hairball.

210
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,917
Because of you dicks,
I have been a cat for so long.

211
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,317
Do you know where this tongue has been?

212
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,276
Places.

213
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,056
I wasn't sure that reversal was
gonna work, because I've been feeling

214
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,436
a little, you know, insane lately.

215
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,398
Yeah. You only have yourself to blame.

216
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,756
Wait, what?

217
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:54,072
You created a time wave when
you changed your past with Desmond.

218
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,200
Because you're the epicenter,

219
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,955
your experience of
this timeline and that one

220
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,440
both exist in your brain.

221
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,394
Just give me a break here, right.

222
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,279
What you're trying to say
is that I broke time?

223
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,830
Yes. Back in New Orleans.

224
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,000
Sure, you don't have to live with
the guilt of damning Desmond,

225
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,077
but you also
never joined the Legends.

226
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,232
Without John's help with the
unicorn at Woodstock, Sara died,

227
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,279
which made the Legends into killers.

228
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,273
There's only one way to fix this...

229
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,960
We go back to Woodstock
and we save Sara.

230
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,190
- Yeah.
- No.

231
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,598
Guys, you're not listening to me.

232
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,679
You have to go to New Orleans
and set history back on track.

233
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,279
Whoa, whoa, Z, you're suggesting
a total reset of the timeline.

234
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,079
All we need is a surgical strike.

235
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,960
Now, if we save Sara,

236
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,556
then the Custodians of the Chronology
never exist.

237
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:43,031
I keep my powers,
Des is de-demoned. Bob's your uncle.

238
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,956
I'm sorry, guys. I have to stop you
before you make this any worse.

239
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,440
Ow!

240
00:11:49,441 --> 00:11:51,319
[chanting]

241
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,950
Right, then.

242
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,669
I'm sorry, love.

243
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,992
Until you can learn
to stay out of my way,

244
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,838
- then you are a cat.
- [hissing, yowling]

245
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,200
In the mood for a prison break?

246
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,715
Yes, I am.

247
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,193
- [Zari meows]
- Is the coast clear?

248
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,280
[objects clatter]

249
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,954
How much of that did you hear?

250
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,550
Uh... [chuckles nervously]

251
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,594
Nothing at all. Nothing about
breaking out or hacking history.

252
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,433
Please don't turn me into a cat.

253
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,200
Well, I didn't turn her into a cat.
I returned her to being a cat,

254
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,999
which is considerably easier,
believe me.

255
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,912
But if you gotta, maybe a calico.
And real fluffy.

256
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,316
Okay, I'm ready. Do it.

257
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,936
- What are we gonna do with her?
- I've no idea.

258
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,760
You don't have to do anything.
I want to help.

259
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,310
You do?

260
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,636
The Custodians of the Chronology
must be stopped.

261
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,518
They turned my Kaupe friend into a rug.

262
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,639
So, if you're trying to defeat them,
I want in.

263
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,856
[Constantine] Watch the bumps, yeah?

264
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,240
- [Constantine] Oi.
- [Mona shushes] Someone might hear you!

265
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,040
[automated voice] <i>Red alert!
The</i> Waverider <i>is landing. Red alert!</i>

266
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,199
Oh, man, the Custodians are here.
Could things get any worse?

267
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,717
Wait! Stop right there! Are you me?

268
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,320
Yes.

269
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,750
From the future.

270
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,672
[gasps]

271
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,877
Do I ever find love?
Or at least, my sunglasses?

272
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,993
- They might be in my other pants.
- Yes, Gary. All that, and more.

273
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,456
- [weapon fires]
- [glass shattering]

274
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,336
[Ray] It's the Custodians.
Notify Mr. Heywood...

275
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,320
But right now,
I need you to delay the Custodians.

276
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,357
Okay! Oh, but be careful.

277
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,576
There's been reports of
a shapeshifter on the loose.

278
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,670
Yeah, I know that already.

279
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,037
Because I'm you
from the future, dummy.

280
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,120
[gasps]

281
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,520
[chuckles]

282
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Okay, okay.

283
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,316
Come on.
We gotta find a place to hide.

284
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,637
Knock, knock. Anybody home?

285
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,197
- [alarm trilling]
- [music playing]

286
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,056
[Constantine] Come on, hurry up.
Let me out of this thing.

287
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,992
[groaning]

288
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,513
Where are we?

289
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,280
This is Ava's office. But she's gone.

290
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,876
Gone, gone?

291
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,757
[Ava] I'm right here, you idiots.

292
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,990
[Nate] Dad.

293
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,512
We tracked a shapeshifter here,

294
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,120
so, we're gonna need you to stand down

295
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,078
and let us do our job
and bag it for you.

296
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:23,718
Your job, son, is to bring the
creatures back to the Bureau alive.

297
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,600
Not leave their insides
strewn through history.

298
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,640
It's called payback for what they did
to Sara, and don't get in our way.

299
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,909
Sharpie, what happened to you?

300
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,153
I'm allowed to grieve in my own way.

301
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,760
Why the hell are you out of your cell?

302
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,469
Oh, plans change, love.

303
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,392
Are you sure you're okay,
Director Sharpe?

304
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,636
I'm fine!

305
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,312
I'm just taking some time to get
my head together after Sara was...

306
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,590
Unicorned.

307
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,160
[Charlie]
I'm really sorry about that.

308
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,114
Things are not as they seem.

309
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,920
- Amaya?
- No.

310
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,471
Well, it's a long story,
but time is... Well, broken.

311
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,360
What are you talking about?

312
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,631
You see, you're living
in a timeline that doesn't exist,

313
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,360
and we are from a timeline
where your hair is still blond.

314
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,640
Okay, I don't have time for this
timey-wimey crap...

315
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,080
No! No, this is the truth.

316
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,277
Now, listen.
The Custodians of the Chronology

317
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,736
are actually the Legends of Tomorrow,

318
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,433
and they're the good guys. Mostly.

319
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,240
Yeah. And the kicker is,
Sara is supposed to be alive.

320
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,235
Did you say Sara's alive?

321
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,596
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

322
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,076
I knew it!
I knew something was wrong.

323
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,352
I mean, I like the Indigo Girls,
but they should not be a way of life.

324
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,393
Then let's help them set things right.

325
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,714
What do you guys need from me?

326
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,757
[Ray] Well, well, well. Look who's
helping our magical fugitive.

327
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,069
[man shouting commands]

328
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,510
We were looking for you.

329
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,074
[man] Got eyes on suspects.

330
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,637
Thought you might wanna have some fun.

331
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,600
I got 12 gauges of fun right here.

332
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,000
That's it.
I'm placing you all under arrest.

333
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,514
Shut your mouth, Pops.

334
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,280
Go!

335
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,920
[man] Take cover.

336
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,920
[Hank] Get them out of here!

337
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,635
[all grunting]

338
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,200
[groans]

339
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,670
[gunshots]

340
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,074
I'll cover you. Go save Sara.

341
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,718
[yelling]

342
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,356

[panting]

344
00:16:40,521 --> 00:16:41,977
Did they really
all just kill each other?

345
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Don't think about it.

346
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,959
We'll go back in time
and we'll fix things. We have to.

347
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,033
Target ahead. Arming the weapons now.

348
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,638
Is that what I think it is?

349
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,673
[Nate] Twilight Sparkle come to life...

[neighing]

351
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:05,197
We didn't screw things up
for the better this year.

352
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,397
We screwed things up
for the more magical.

353
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,160
- Yes! [chuckles]
- Nice shot!

354
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,514
Who the hell is in the <i>Jumpship?</i>

355
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,992
Who cares? Mission accomplished.

356
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,960
And you guys thought
we needed Constantine. [chuckles]

357
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,278
Yeah, we saved Sara's life.
That should fix everything.

358
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,400
The Custodians should be back
to being the Legends,

359
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,274
and Zari should no longer be a cat.

360
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,776
All right, this might be
a crossed-wire thing in my brain,

361
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,712
but that is still a cat
sitting there, isn't it?

362
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,576
Killing the unicorn
didn't solve the problem.

363

- [Constantine grunts]
- [meows]

364
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,512
No, Zari. We're not going back
to New Orleans.

365
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,155
We need to find out what's wrong
with this timeline and fix it.

366
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,515
All right, we go back to the Bureau,
figure out our next step.

367
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,936
[Constantine] <i>Charlie? Come on,
talk to me, love. What's happening?</i>

368
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,030
Is everything normal?

369
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,076
[sighs] No.

370
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,920
In fact, things are
pretty far from normal.

371
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,070
No reason to panic.
We still got this.

372
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,376
Right, we'll find out how the boys
died in this timeline,

373
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,720
then we'll go back and save them.

374
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,234
And hopefully, when they return,

375
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,656
they won't be
magical-creature murderers.

376
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,149
Right. Sounds so simple.

377
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,670
[woman] Hey, watch it.

378
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,073
Out of the way, suckers.

379
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,913
Make way for SOS.

380
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,634
What the hell is "SOS"?

00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,159
Good morning, Sirens.

386
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,920
[all] Good morning, Hank.

387
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,913
I hope you're ready to go to work today,

388
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,640
because we have one hell of
a case on our hands.

389
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,160
If anyone knows what happened
to the guys, it'll be them.

<i>Hang tight on the ship.</i>

391
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,436
Looks like I'm joining the SOS.

392
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,715
All right, ladies. Weapons check.

393

[guns powering up]

394
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,234
Way ahead of ya, babe.

395
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,433
My pistol's hot and ready.

396
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,116
Hey, girls. Save some fun for me.

397
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,790
Amaya, what are you doing here?

398
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,713
We thought you went back to 1942.

399
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,954
I did, but then I...

400
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,198
I heard about your monster problem,
and, well, I couldn't stay away.

401
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,796
It's perfect timing.
We are up to our peaches

402
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,998
with magical creatures,
and about to kick some ass.

403
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,030
I'm in.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know what you're thinking.

413
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,376
You want me to put things back
the way they were,

414
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,357
but that's not gonna bloody happen.

No. I'm not all right, to be honest.

[Zari growls]

418
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,355
So, what kind of fun costumes
are we gonna need for this mission?

419
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,952
We don't do costumes anymore.

420
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,856
Yeah, we stopped, so we could
streamline the missions.

421
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,056
Yeah, why get all dressed up if we're

422
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,040
just wasting
these magical creatures straightaway?

423

Please tell me you don't
keep a trophy room of their skulls.

What do we look like, barbarians?

426
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,314
No, we just toss them.

00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,760
- You, what?
- [Agent Sharpe] Yeah.

428
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,121
Ever since that Fairy Godmother
killed Nate, Ray and Rory,

429
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,238
we just waste any magical creature
that comes in our path.

430
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,320
No questions asked.

431

Well, they can't all be bad.

We haven't met a good one.

Hey, how's Zambesi?

- [Gideon] Zambesi?

It's great. Yeah, it's like, chill.

Super chill. [chuckles]

Right, we gotta take care of
the Fairy Godmother in Salem.

446
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,037
Fire up the ship.
I'm heading up there now.

No more tea and crumpets
for this dodgy doppelganger!

449

Hard Drive here knew you
weren't really Amaya all along.

450
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,436
I'm equipped to detect
shapeshifter pheromones.

How fortunate our white whale
swam right into our net.

What is it with you guys
and white whales?

453
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,918
You really think you three can take me?

Oh, I can take you alone.

Damn it! Get back here!

457
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,235
Hi. How were
the Sirens of Space-time?

458
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,800
Well, they're not the Custodians.

459
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,480
They may actually be worse.

[Charlie]
Now, let's go save the lads.

462
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:41,439
The three of you have been so rude,
with your nasty attitude.

<i>It will be ever so sublime
to slowly choke you out with vines</i>

you better make it fast.

465
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,190

Fairy Godmother, are you finished?

470
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,073
- That was fast.
- Yes.

471
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,799
And I was thinking,

472
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,992
if I'm to be your Fairy Godmother,

473
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,239
you must start behaving
like a proper young lady.

474
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,600
How do you mean?

475
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,355
Nothing dreadful or out of the ordinary.

00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,751
Just chores, daily baths,

478
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,798
and you must start eating broccoli.

479
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,234
But I don't want all that.

480
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,559
Well, until our bond is severed,

481
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,435
I'm afraid that's the way it must be.

482
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,038
Now, eat the broccoli.

483
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,076
Fairy Godmother, I relinquish you!

484
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,560

You know, I hate to jinx this,
but I really think

491
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,155
we nailed it this time.

492
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,800
[Zari] I just hope you guys are right.

493
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,956
What's wrong?

494
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,510
What are you looking at?

495
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,240
Is there something on my nose?

496
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,960
Bollocks!

00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,436
[woman] Looks like there's reptilians
in the Renaissance.

500
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,816
Sounds like a team meeting. I'll just
pop in and say hello, shall I?

501
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,760
[woman] So, put on your

Just tell me. Why are you puppets?

531
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,873
Because Rory called us
"a bunch of Time Bureau puppets."

532
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,159
Yeah, and then he ran off with his

[Constantine] It's worse than I thought.

After we managed to separate
the Fairy Godmother from Prudence,

she somehow glommed onto Rory.

Yeah. I mean, sure, it took us
a few cracks, but fixed the timeline.

[Charlie] Passed out, mate.

[Zari] He didn't just pass out.

bandages you call a timeline.

What happens to all the people who
need you alive and Constantine-ing?

You can leave that
to the real heroes, all right?

00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,195
This isn't about saving
Desmond anymore.

572

It's an excuse for you
to give up on yourself.

Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Just leave him alone, will ya?

574
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,399
You think because there's no plaques,
the world is fixed?

575
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,831
I promise you,
it's just as messed up out there

I know you don't want
to send Desmond to hell,

579
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,000
but that doesn't have to be
the end of the story.

580
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,716
You of all people can find a way
to keep fighting for him.

581
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,240
Go to New Orleans
and set things right.

582
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,120
Don't listen to her!
Come on, John. It's you and me.

583
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,314
We can make this timeline work.

584
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,400
No, Charlie.

585
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,760
We've tried over and over and over
to get what we wanted,

586
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,840
and it hasn't worked.

But Zari's right.

588
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,960
There's still hope for Desmond.

589
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,632
Maybe there's still hope
for your powers, too.

they're who I am.

00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,314
I'm not gonna just sit around
and hope that they come back.

593
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,400
I'll fight for them.

Ava? I wasn't expecting to see you here.

601
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,513
Yeah, the Bureau got an emergency alert

602
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,717
about a magical presence
in New Orleans, 2018.

00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,640
I thought maybe we could
check it out together.

604
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,996
Let's get to work.

605
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,520
Cool.

00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,236
I didn't live this specific moment,
but I remember it.

608
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,717
It's all part of my
jumbled bloody memory.

609
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,874
By the way, only about 10% of what
you're saying makes any sense.

610
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,599
But by all means, continue.

611
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,195
Right, so, the earliest me
just left for the market.

612
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,875
The other one is upstairs
breaking up with Des right now.

613
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,151
And when Des leaves upset,

614
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,915
I'll stop him,
put things back to normal.

615
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,195
[Zari] <i>All right, good luck.</i>

616
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,680
Blimey, that's a lot of ammo.

617
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,760
"Blimey"?

618
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,432
Oh, I meant, wow!

619
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,870
All right, boys,
orders are shoot to kill.

620
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,759
Wait, wait, wait. Shouldn't we discuss

621
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,296
what kind of creature
we're dealing with here?

622
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,720
We can't just go in guns a-blazing.

623
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,759
What if whatever's causing this
is just a little misguided?

624
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,078
- It's a magical fugitive.
- We kill those.

625
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,278
You two head out. Stay on the comms.

626
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,830
[Mick] Hmm.

627
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,312
I killed the man I loved, and for what,

628
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,920
to buy New Orleans a little more time.

629
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,320
Neron needs souls...

630
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,629
Okay, right,

631
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:05,272
I think that something should be
landing right here any second now.

632
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,520
I work alone.

633
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,960
Got it.

634
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,953
All right, Gideon,
what are we looking at?

635
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,096
[Gideon] I've located
multiple targets on the ground,

636
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,237
each one with a substantial
magical signature.

637
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,710
Do we have a visual yet?

638
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,040
[Gideon] Coming up now.

639
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,592
[Sara] Wait. That's John Constantine,
and there's more than one of him.

640
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,156
Looks like our shapeshifter
has a shapeshifter friend.

641
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,576
Wait a second. How do you know that

642
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,160
that's not really
Constantine out there?

643
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,391
Because it's John Constantine.
He doesn't time-travel.

644
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,296
Believe me, I tried to recruit him.

645
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,896
Okay, so, why don't we capture
all three of them

646
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,960
so we can find out if any of them
are the real John?

647
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,760
What is wrong with you?

648
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,120
Are you feeling okay?

649
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,954
I'm fine. I'm just a firm believer
in taking precautions.

650
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,350
[chuckles]

651
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,591
"Precautions." Good one.

652
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,917
<i>Ray, Rory, what's your status?</i>

653
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,915
All right, we're in position.

654
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,959
We got sights on the shapeshifter.

655
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,350
When do we get to shoot?

656
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:58,075
[Sara] <i>All right, on my mark, open fire.</i>

657
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,640
Sara, don't!

658
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,920
Damn it, Ava. Why not?

659
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,435
Because I'm the shapeshifter.

660
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,471
Guys, stand down.
We have a code blue on the ship.

661
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,394
What the hell is a "code blue"?

662
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,312
Just don't shoot yet.

663
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,696
[Desmond] If there's something going on
in your life, just be honest with me.

664
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,520
Yeah, do you know what,
this thing between us,

665
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,069
it isn't real, it never was,
it doesn't exist.

666
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,676
You should go.

667
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,919
Yeah, you're right. I should.

668
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,271
But this was real, Johnny.

669
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,391
[door opens and closes]

670
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,559
Hey, you dropped this.

671
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,995
My phone.

672
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,677
How did you get down here?
You were just upstairs.

673
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,136
Yeah, never mind about that
right now.

674
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,516
I have something really
important to tell you.

675
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,936
You know what, I think you've
said quite enough today already.

676
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,960
No, Des, please.

677
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,595
Give me a minute, all right?

678
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,517
[Sara] So, you're the shapeshifter.

679
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,074
Why do you look like Amaya?

680
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,949
[sighs] It is complicated,

681
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,360
but this is how you know me.

682
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,877
What's happened to the Legends
to make you like this?

683
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,636
What do you mean?

684
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,400
You guys are so intent
on killing magical creatures.

685
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,200
Can't you see that this is wrong?

686
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,475
[sighs]

687
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,710
Not really.

688
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,520
Look, now, I know this sounds crazy,

689
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,480
but the "me" you were just
speaking to upstairs, he's my past.

690
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,800
So, you break up with me
out of the blue,

691
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,354
act like a total ass.

692
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,557
And suddenly, that's in the past.

693
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,472
- Just like that?
- No, listen, literally,

694
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,072
that is me from ages ago,

695
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,856
but the person who is standing
in front of you right now

696
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:48,475
is a little bit older
and he's a little bit wiser.

697
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,109
Sure. Still playing games, clearly.

698
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,039
Look,

699
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,316
I thought this was real.

700
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,235
It is real, Des. And that's why
I moved heaven and earth,

701
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,119
so that I could save you from
a lifetime, an eternity

702
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,237
of anguish, anguish that I caused.

703
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:09,038
Look... I guess
what I'm trying to say is

704
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,392
I'm sorry you ever even met me.

705
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,600
Don't be sorry.

706
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,750
[chuckles]

707
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:21,275
Only a fool would fall in love
with John Constantine

708
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,959
and not expect it to be rocky.

709
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,677
I knew the risks.

710
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,316
And I took them anyway.

711
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,520
For you.

712
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,516
I'm still pissed at you.

713
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,911
Why can't we just go back
to the way things were?

714
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,793
That's exactly what I was thinking.

715
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,750
What is that?

716
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,639
Know one thing, Desmond...

717
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,436
I'm not quitting on you.

718
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,919
Sara, crazy-looking Constantine
just memory-flashed a civilian.

719
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,040
Can we shoot him yet?

720
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,320
[Sara] Wait for my signal.

721
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,953
I'm dealing with a situation.

722
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,080
[groans]

723
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,120
Constantine might be...

724
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,390
[Ray] <i>Sara? Sara?</i>

725
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,320
[Sara] <i>Hold on a second, Ray.</i>

726
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,195
Where did you get that?

727
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,480
[Sara] Look, I don't know who you are,

728
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,518
or why you are on my ship,

729
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,993
but you're never leaving.

730
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,600
Oh, hello, handsome.

731
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,235
What are you doing,
standing in the middle of the street?

732
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,640
I wa... Um...

733
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:36,230
- You went to the market...
- I did.

734
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,056
Next thing I knew,
I was standing in the street.

735
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,080
I don't know.

736
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,994
[both chuckle]

737
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,560
[Charlie] Wait, Sara, please.

738
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:47,550
Just tell me why you're so intent
on killing magical creatures.

739
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,353
Because that's how we stay alive.

740
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,040
[groans]

741
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,560
[grunts angrily] Stop doing that!

742
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,032
- Don't you remember London?
- No.

743
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,715
When you and I first met,

744
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,076
and I helped you see the truth
about magical creatures?

745
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,390
And how did you do that?

746
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,200
By being me.

747
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,231
By showing you that I'm
not here to hurt humans.

748
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,232
That not all "monsters"
need to be put down.

749
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,830
That's cute, but it never happened.

750
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,430
What?

751
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,034
How can you not remember?

752
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,116
[gasps] Bollocks.

753
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,480
Because of Constantine,
you and I never met

754
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,999
and you never changed.

755
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,193
I'm the missing ingredient in
every one of these botched timelines.

756
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:34,151
I'm sorry, but all I see is a threat
that needs to be taken out.

757
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,238
Ray, fire when ready.

758

00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,120
- [Desmond] You got eggs?
- I've got the eggs.

760
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,720
I got the bread.
Got everything we need.

761
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:45,351
- Soufflé?
- Soufflé, but first things first.

[Zari] John, you okay?

00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,920
Yeah, well...

775
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,798
My mind is
no longer split in two, but...

I can't say the same
about my heart, though.

777

You?

778
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,513
Well, lost my powers.

779
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,159
Back to being mortal.

Sorry, guys. It had to be done.

781
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,951
Well, let's go and find
the Legends, shall we?

782
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:41,034
- Yeah, see if all this was worth it.
- Yeah.

783
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,191
Well, everything seems
pretty normal so far.

This isn't over, you ding-a-lings!

You better watch
your knees, Sara Lance.

Oh, no. Is everyone a puppet again?

787
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:02,960
What?

788
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,456
- What are you talking about?
- I'll kill you all!

What is this?
Why are you being so weird?

793
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:23,715
Well, I do have a little bit
of a tale to tell, to be honest.

794
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,840
Do you fancy a drink?

795
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:28,118
Hmm, one of those stories. Let's go.

796
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,829
Hey, Zari.
I want to say that I'm sorry.

797
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:38,630
For what? For stuffing me into a bag
or almost destroying all of history?

798
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,790
Well, yeah, that, too.

799
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:43,999
But what I'm really sorry about is that
we got off on the wrong foot.

800
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,589
You're a shapeshifter.
Your whole deal is tricking people.

801
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,717
Yeah, but now,
I'm being honest with you.

802
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:51,275
You know, I could have been anyone
when I got my powers back.

803
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,280
Do you know why I kept coming
back to this form?

804
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,079
Because Amaya is very hot?

805
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,600
It's because this is the form I was
when I joined the Legends.

806
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,911
Now, I've been a part of many crews.

807
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,271
And you guys... Well,

808
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,915
you're not rubbish.

809
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,397
Listen, destroying history
for personal gain,

810
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,233
it's happened
to almost everyone here.

811
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,795
Rite of passage.

812
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,240
So, you think I'm hot, then?

813
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,114
[door opens]

814
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:26,358
I made snickerdoodles
with your recipe.

815
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,670
Not bad.

816
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,436
Hmm.

817
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,076
I'm reading your novel.
I'm on the last chapter.

818
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,999
Your female characters are shallow,

819
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:37,471
libidinous, and so much fun to read.

820
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,199
[grunts] Thanks.

821
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,114
Yeah. Good job... "Rebecca Silver"?

822
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,391
- Nom-de-plum.
- Got it.

823
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,039
So, let me get this straight.

824
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,920
They're making love on
the surface of the sun?

825
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,200
It's a metaphor.

826
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,756
Got it.

827
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,240
[Constantine] <i>And the worst part...</i>

828
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,680
It didn't even make a bloody difference.

829
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I was a fool,

830
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,549
thinking I could outrun this fight
flying around with you lot.

831
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:09,079
Yeah, we tend to fly
directly into fights.

832
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,400
[chuckles softly]

833
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:12,597
But we do it together.

834
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,189
And we have your back.

835
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,600
As long as you know what
you're getting yourself into.

836
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:23,157
Because a demon like Neron
doesn't just want to win.

837
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,439
He wants to win
in the cruelest possible way.

838
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,315
[cell phone ringing]

839
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,760
Yeah?

840
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,315
The Kaupe escaped?

841
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,880
Here's what I want you to do.

842
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,714
Track him down and recapture him,
or else.

843
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,040
[cell phone beeps]

844
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,320
[clears throat] Um...

845
00:41:46,321 --> 00:41:47,755
There has been a setback.

846
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,718
But we'll make it right.

847
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,234
Oh, you'd better.

848
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:05,113
