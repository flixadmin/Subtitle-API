1
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:44,759
<i>"In the decade of the 1930s
even the great city of Metropolis...</i>

2
00:00:45,261 --> 00:00:48,924
<i>"...was not spared the ravages
of the world-wide depression.</i>

3
00:00:49,099 --> 00:00:50,999
<i>"In the times of fear and confusion...</i>

4
00:00:51,267 --> 00:00:55,135
<i>"...the job of informing the public
was the responsibility...</i>

5
00:00:55,205 --> 00:00:56,638
<i>"...of the Daily Planet.</i>

6
00:00:56,706 --> 00:00:58,970
<i>"A great metropolitan newspaper...</i>

7
00:00:59,042 --> 00:01:04,173
<i>"...whose reputation for clarity and truth
had become a symbol of hope...</i>

8
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,271
<i>"...for the city of Metropolis."</i>

9
00:06:40,783 --> 00:06:42,978
This is no fantasy.

10
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,248
No careless product of wild imagination.

11
00:06:47,924 --> 00:06:49,915
No, my good friends...

12
00:06:51,894 --> 00:06:53,657
...these indictments...

13
00:06:55,364 --> 00:06:57,332
...I've brought you today...

14
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:02,361
...specific charges listed herein
against the individuals...

15
00:07:03,306 --> 00:07:07,208
...their acts of treason.
Their ultimate aim of sedition.

16
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:11,505
These...

17
00:07:13,816 --> 00:07:16,512
...are matters of undeniable fact.

18
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:23,022
I ask you now to pronounce judgment...

19
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,854
...on those accused.

20
00:07:33,136 --> 00:07:34,831
On this...

21
00:07:35,304 --> 00:07:37,602
...this mindless aberration...

22
00:07:37,773 --> 00:07:41,903
...whose only means of expression
are wanton violence and destruction.

23
00:07:45,281 --> 00:07:46,612
On the woman Ursa...

24
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:50,246
...whose perversions
and unreasoning hatred of all mankind...

25
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:54,221
...have threatened even the children
of the Planet Krypton.

26
00:08:02,932 --> 00:08:04,957
Finally, General Zod.

27
00:08:06,536 --> 00:08:08,436
Once trusted by this Council...

28
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:12,367
...charged with maintaining the defense
of the Planet Krypton itself.

29
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:16,940
Chief Architect of this intended revolution
and author of this insidious plot...

30
00:08:17,813 --> 00:08:20,281
...to establish a new order amongst us...

31
00:08:21,684 --> 00:08:24,482
...with himself as absolute ruler.

32
00:08:27,156 --> 00:08:28,885
You have heard the evidence.

33
00:08:30,393 --> 00:08:32,827
The decision of the Council
will now be heard.

34
00:08:32,895 --> 00:08:33,691
<i>Guilty!</i>

35
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:36,925
<i>Guilty!</i>

36
00:08:38,501 --> 00:08:39,490
<i>Guilty!</i>

37
00:08:42,972 --> 00:08:44,803
The vote must be unanimous, Jor-El.

38
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:48,139
It has therefore now become your decision.

39
00:08:48,678 --> 00:08:50,737
You alone will condemn us if you wish...

40
00:08:51,013 --> 00:08:53,641
...and you alone will be held responsible
by me!

41
00:09:02,692 --> 00:09:03,488
Join us!

42
00:09:05,761 --> 00:09:08,753
You have been known to disagree
with the Council before.

43
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:13,625
Yours could become an important voice
in the new order, second only to my own!

44
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:17,930
I offer you a chance for greatness, Jor-El!

45
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,301
Take it! Join us!

46
00:09:22,111 --> 00:09:24,375
You will bow down before me, Jor-El.

47
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,977
I swear it!
No matter that it takes an eternity!

48
00:09:28,451 --> 00:09:30,919
You will bow down before me!

49
00:09:31,454 --> 00:09:33,854
Both you and then one day...

50
00:09:33,923 --> 00:09:35,220
...your heirs!

51
00:11:05,147 --> 00:11:09,140
<i>Forgive me, forgive me...</i>

52
00:11:26,869 --> 00:11:30,999
An unpleasant duty
has been masterly performed, Jor-El.

53
00:11:31,407 --> 00:11:34,171
They have received the fate they deserved.

54
00:11:34,744 --> 00:11:37,235
Isolation in the Phantom Zone...

55
00:11:37,313 --> 00:11:39,440
...an eternal living death.

56
00:11:40,883 --> 00:11:43,613
A chance for life, nonetheless.

57
00:11:44,653 --> 00:11:45,779
As opposed to us.

58
00:11:47,423 --> 00:11:48,685
It's suicide.

59
00:11:49,392 --> 00:11:52,020
No, it's worse, it's genocide.

60
00:11:52,228 --> 00:11:54,093
Be warned, Jor-El.

61
00:11:54,597 --> 00:11:58,556
The Council has already evaluated
this outlandish theory of yours.

62
00:12:00,102 --> 00:12:03,265
My friends, you know me
to be neither rash nor impulsive.

63
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:08,476
I am not given
to wild unsupported statements...

64
00:12:09,678 --> 00:12:12,841
...and I tell you that we must evacuate
this planet immediately.

65
00:12:14,183 --> 00:12:17,152
Jor-El, you are one
of Krypton's greatest scientists.

66
00:12:17,386 --> 00:12:19,183
Yes, but so is Vond-Ah.

67
00:12:24,527 --> 00:12:26,085
I don't question your data.

68
00:12:26,695 --> 00:12:28,219
The facts are undeniable.

69
00:12:32,201 --> 00:12:34,533
It's your conclusions
we find unsupportable.

70
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,565
This planet will explode within 30 days.

71
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:41,899
If not sooner.

72
00:12:42,745 --> 00:12:45,179
I tell you Krypton
is simply shifting its orbit.

73
00:12:46,048 --> 00:12:46,878
Jor-El...

74
00:12:47,917 --> 00:12:49,282
...be reasonable.

75
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,380
My friend...

76
00:12:54,723 --> 00:12:58,318
...I have never been otherwise.
This madness is yours.

77
00:12:58,661 --> 00:13:00,356
This discussion is terminated.

78
00:13:02,064 --> 00:13:04,498
The decision of the Council is final.

79
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,279
Any attempt by you to create...

80
00:13:26,822 --> 00:13:30,121
...a climate of fear and panic
among the populace...

81
00:13:30,259 --> 00:13:33,990
...must be deemed by us
an act of insurrection.

82
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,755
You would accuse me of insurrection?

83
00:13:38,033 --> 00:13:40,524
Has it now become a crime to cherish life?

84
00:13:41,871 --> 00:13:44,772
You would be banished
to endless imprisonment...

85
00:13:45,441 --> 00:13:46,806
...in the Phantom Zone:

86
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:48,710
The eternal void...

87
00:13:49,812 --> 00:13:51,871
...which you, yourself discovered.

88
00:13:53,616 --> 00:13:57,382
Will you abide by the Council's decision?

89
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,449
I will remain silent.

90
00:14:06,028 --> 00:14:07,620
Neither I...

91
00:14:08,397 --> 00:14:10,957
...nor my wife, will leave Krypton.

92
00:15:07,122 --> 00:15:08,248
Have you finished?

93
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,356
Nearly.

94
00:15:18,267 --> 00:15:19,894
It's the only answer, Lara.

95
00:15:20,069 --> 00:15:21,832
If he remains here with us...

96
00:15:23,305 --> 00:15:25,330
...he will die as surely as we will.

97
00:15:25,474 --> 00:15:26,805
But why Earth, Jor-El?

98
00:15:27,209 --> 00:15:29,643
They're primitives,
thousands of years behind us.

99
00:15:30,045 --> 00:15:32,343
He will need that advantage to survive.

100
00:15:34,783 --> 00:15:36,444
Their atmosphere will...

101
00:15:38,287 --> 00:15:39,311
...sustain him.

102
00:15:47,496 --> 00:15:49,293
He will defy their gravity.

103
00:15:49,498 --> 00:15:51,398
He will look like one of them.

104
00:15:52,434 --> 00:15:54,299
He won't be one of them.

105
00:15:54,937 --> 00:15:55,767
No.

106
00:15:56,672 --> 00:15:59,869
His dense molecular structure
will make him strong.

107
00:16:01,677 --> 00:16:04,145
He'll be odd. Different.

108
00:16:06,315 --> 00:16:09,409
He'll be fast. Virtually invulnerable.

109
00:16:10,986 --> 00:16:13,716
Isolated. Alone.

110
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,425
He will not be alone.

111
00:16:25,668 --> 00:16:27,363
He will never be alone.

112
00:16:37,179 --> 00:16:40,080
The energy input to Jor-El's quarters
is now in excess.

113
00:16:40,315 --> 00:16:43,478
Our data indicates the loss
is due to a misuse of energy.

114
00:16:44,353 --> 00:16:45,547
Investigate.

115
00:16:46,355 --> 00:16:49,347
And if the investigation proves correct?

116
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,653
He knew the penalty he faced.

117
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,232
He even is a member of this Council.

118
00:16:59,635 --> 00:17:01,569
The law will be upheld.

119
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:46,937
You will travel far, my little Kal-El.

120
00:17:49,384 --> 00:17:50,942
But we will never leave you.

121
00:17:52,554 --> 00:17:54,283
Even in the face of our death...

122
00:17:55,691 --> 00:17:57,556
...the richness of our lives...

123
00:17:59,461 --> 00:18:00,894
...shall be yours.

124
00:18:02,231 --> 00:18:05,632
All that I have, all that I've learned,
everything I feel...

125
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,727
...all this and more, I...

126
00:18:11,106 --> 00:18:12,835
...I bequeath you, my son.

127
00:18:16,578 --> 00:18:18,478
You will carry me inside you...

128
00:18:19,815 --> 00:18:21,749
...all the days of your life.

129
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:25,653
You will make my strength your own...

130
00:18:26,488 --> 00:18:29,013
...see my life through your eyes...

131
00:18:29,758 --> 00:18:32,090
...as your life will be seen through mine.

132
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:37,825
The son becomes the father,
and the father...

133
00:18:38,901 --> 00:18:40,232
...the son.

134
00:18:44,072 --> 00:18:45,403
This is all I...

135
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:52,141
...all I can send you, Kal-El.

136
00:23:11,406 --> 00:23:14,000
<i>... which Einstein called his theory
of relativity.</i>

137
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:16,878
<i>Embedded in the crystals before you...</i>

138
00:23:17,412 --> 00:23:20,711
<i>... is the total accumulation of all literature
and scientific fact...</i>

139
00:23:20,949 --> 00:23:22,814
<i>... from dozens of other worlds...</i>

140
00:23:22,918 --> 00:23:25,182
<i>... spanning the 28 known galaxies.</i>

141
00:23:45,941 --> 00:23:49,900
<i>Early Chinese writings point out
the complex relationship between...</i>

142
00:23:53,215 --> 00:23:56,514
<i>By carrying this complex equation
to its ultimate power, my son...</i>

143
00:24:00,922 --> 00:24:03,220
<i>Chief among these powers
will be your sight...</i>

144
00:24:03,325 --> 00:24:05,452
<i>... your strength, your hearing...</i>

145
00:24:05,727 --> 00:24:08,992
<i>... your ability to propel yourself
at almost limitless speed.</i>

146
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:14,992
<i>The early history of our universe was
a bloody mosaic of interplanetary war.</i>

147
00:24:15,637 --> 00:24:18,299
<i>Each of the six galaxies
which you will pass through...</i>

148
00:24:18,607 --> 00:24:21,371
<i>... contain their own individual law
of space and time.</i>

149
00:24:21,443 --> 00:24:24,708
<i>It is forbidden for you to interfere
with human history.</i>

150
00:24:58,046 --> 00:24:59,536
- What!
- What was that?

151
00:25:24,339 --> 00:25:26,899
Now wouldn't that beat all get out.
Well, you...

152
00:25:36,885 --> 00:25:37,909
Oh, Pa!

153
00:25:38,887 --> 00:25:39,717
Oh, my.

154
00:26:13,421 --> 00:26:15,514
All these years, as happy as we've been...

155
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:19,253
...how I've prayed the good Lord
would see fit to give us a child.

156
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:23,996
Honey, will you hand me that rag up there.

157
00:26:24,399 --> 00:26:25,889
You take things easy now.

158
00:26:25,967 --> 00:26:28,595
Remember what Doc Frye said
about that heart of yours.

159
00:26:34,476 --> 00:26:37,775
Now the first thing we've got to do
when we get home is find out...

160
00:26:38,546 --> 00:26:40,411
...who that boy's proper family is.

161
00:26:41,716 --> 00:26:44,184
He hasn't got any.
Not around here, anyway.

162
00:26:48,657 --> 00:26:51,057
Are you thinking
what I think you are thinking?

163
00:26:52,327 --> 00:26:55,956
We could say he's the child of my cousin
in North Dakota...

164
00:26:56,731 --> 00:26:58,221
...and just now orphaned.

165
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,928
Jonathan, he's only a baby.

166
00:27:03,138 --> 00:27:06,767
Martha, now you saw how we found him.

167
00:27:10,145 --> 00:27:12,943
Martha Clark Kent,
are you listening to what I'm saying?

168
00:27:46,314 --> 00:27:47,406
Come on, gang.

169
00:27:50,819 --> 00:27:52,684
That was a great game.

170
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:54,911
All right.

171
00:27:57,125 --> 00:27:59,889
Come on, hustle. Let's go.
Stack your helmets neatly.

172
00:28:00,528 --> 00:28:03,622
Remember about those uniforms,
cleaned and washed by tomorrow...

173
00:28:03,698 --> 00:28:05,598
...and looking like a football team.

174
00:28:05,834 --> 00:28:09,167
Clark, let's have those clothes washed
and ready for tomorrow's game.

175
00:28:09,237 --> 00:28:10,864
Got to beat Mount Vernon High.

176
00:28:11,373 --> 00:28:12,738
Can you give me a lift?

177
00:28:19,514 --> 00:28:20,378
Lana?

178
00:28:20,582 --> 00:28:24,382
Don't bother with these.
I'll take them in with the other equipment.

179
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,915
- Thank you, Clark.
- Sure.

180
00:28:29,057 --> 00:28:32,026
Listen, a whole bunch of us are going up
to Mary Ellen's.

181
00:28:32,227 --> 00:28:35,526
Play some records.
Would you like to come?

182
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:38,462
Sure.

183
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,591
Sounds like it could be a lot of fun.

184
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:43,233
Kent can't make it.
Still got a lot of work to do.

185
00:28:44,005 --> 00:28:46,735
What are you talking about?
I've just finished stacking...

186
00:28:46,908 --> 00:28:47,897
All that?

187
00:28:48,877 --> 00:28:50,037
Oh, Brad!

188
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:52,612
Hey, come on, Lana.

189
00:28:54,916 --> 00:28:55,848
Let's go.

190
00:28:57,385 --> 00:28:58,818
- He has to clean up.
- 'Bye, Clark.

191
00:28:59,053 --> 00:29:01,078
- 'Bye, Lana.
- Clean this up, Clark.

192
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:04,917
'Bye, Clark.

193
00:29:10,598 --> 00:29:12,259
'Bye, Clark.

194
00:29:12,934 --> 00:29:14,902
See you tomorrow. Bye-bye.

195
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,607
Mommy, I saw a boy out there
run as fast as the train!

196
00:30:28,776 --> 00:30:30,175
Faster even!

197
00:30:30,979 --> 00:30:34,540
Lois Lane,
you have a writer's gift for invention.

198
00:30:34,616 --> 00:30:36,607
- I'll say that for you.
- But...

199
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:39,079
Lois, please read your book.

200
00:30:40,154 --> 00:30:41,553
No one ever believes me.

201
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:15,486
Hey, look, there's Clark!

202
00:31:18,526 --> 00:31:19,515
Clark?

203
00:31:20,595 --> 00:31:22,187
How did you get here so fast?

204
00:31:23,331 --> 00:31:24,263
I ran.

205
00:31:24,532 --> 00:31:25,760
Ran, huh?

206
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:28,936
Told you he was an oddball.
Let's get out of here.

207
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:38,171
Been showing off a bit, haven't you, Son?

208
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,922
I didn't mean to show off, Pa.

209
00:31:56,698 --> 00:32:00,361
It's just that guys like that Brad,
I just want to tear them apart.

210
00:32:00,435 --> 00:32:01,459
Yeah, I know.

211
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:03,937
Yeah, I know I shouldn't.

212
00:32:04,038 --> 00:32:06,836
Yeah, I know you can do
all these amazing things...

213
00:32:06,908 --> 00:32:09,706
...and sometimes you think
that you will just go bust...

214
00:32:09,777 --> 00:32:11,745
...unless you can tell people about it.

215
00:32:11,813 --> 00:32:13,075
- Yeah.
- That's right.

216
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:16,150
I mean, every time I get the football
I can make a touchdown.

217
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:18,047
- That's for sure.
- Every time.

218
00:32:18,386 --> 00:32:21,913
Is it showing off when somebody's doing
the things he's capable of doing?

219
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:24,024
Is a bird showing off when it flies?

220
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:26,820
No, no. Now, you listen to me.

221
00:32:27,562 --> 00:32:31,362
When you came to us, we thought
people would take you away...

222
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:34,399
...when they found out
the things that you do.

223
00:32:34,636 --> 00:32:36,467
It worried us a lot.

224
00:32:36,638 --> 00:32:39,869
Then when a man gets older
and he thinks very differently.

225
00:32:40,408 --> 00:32:41,898
And things get very clear.

226
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:47,343
And there's one thing I do know, Son,
and that is you are here for a reason.

227
00:32:48,082 --> 00:32:50,744
I don't know whose reason,
or whatever the reason is...

228
00:32:50,818 --> 00:32:52,376
...maybe it's because...

229
00:32:56,524 --> 00:32:57,650
I don't know.

230
00:32:59,994 --> 00:33:03,589
But I do know one thing.
It's not to score touchdowns.

231
00:33:07,101 --> 00:33:08,193
Thanks, Dad.

232
00:33:09,871 --> 00:33:11,566
I'll race you to it. Yeah.

233
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:12,771
You will?

234
00:33:13,107 --> 00:33:15,075
Come on, Papa. Run. Come on. Move.

235
00:33:15,309 --> 00:33:18,107
Go, go. Come on. Hey, Baron.

236
00:33:49,577 --> 00:33:51,044
Jonathan!

237
00:33:57,385 --> 00:33:58,374
Dad.

238
00:34:49,537 --> 00:34:51,528
All those things I can do...

239
00:34:53,441 --> 00:34:55,375
...all those powers...

240
00:34:57,779 --> 00:34:59,804
...and I couldn't even save him.

241
00:37:59,794 --> 00:38:01,762
Clark, get up.

242
00:38:06,233 --> 00:38:08,030
Good morning, Smiley.

243
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,463
Clark, breakfast.

244
00:38:15,276 --> 00:38:17,471
Are you going to sleep all day?

245
00:38:19,313 --> 00:38:21,577
Clark, come on. Get up.

246
00:39:22,643 --> 00:39:23,871
I have to leave.

247
00:39:30,251 --> 00:39:32,310
I knew this time would come.

248
00:39:33,554 --> 00:39:36,284
We both knew it
from the day we found you.

249
00:39:48,235 --> 00:39:50,260
I talked to Ben Hubbard yesterday.

250
00:39:52,273 --> 00:39:56,437
He said that he'd be happy
to help out from now on.

251
00:40:05,453 --> 00:40:06,477
Mother!

252
00:40:08,222 --> 00:40:09,314
I know, Son.

253
00:40:11,926 --> 00:40:12,915
I know.

254
00:40:17,298 --> 00:40:20,096
Do you know where you're headed?

255
00:40:24,705 --> 00:40:25,694
North.

256
00:40:31,612 --> 00:40:32,874
Remember us, Son.

257
00:40:35,282 --> 00:40:36,715
Always remember us.

258
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:14,813
<i>My son...</i>

259
00:46:22,162 --> 00:46:23,891
<i>... you do not remember me.</i>

260
00:46:25,499 --> 00:46:26,625
<i>I am Jor-El.</i>

261
00:46:28,402 --> 00:46:29,699
<i>I am your father.</i>

262
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:34,834
<i>By now you will have reached
your eighteenth year...</i>

263
00:46:35,542 --> 00:46:37,169
<i>... as it is measured on Earth.</i>

264
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:39,868
<i>By that reckoning...</i>

265
00:46:40,981 --> 00:46:44,007
<i>... I will have been dead
for many thousands of your years.</i>

266
00:46:46,587 --> 00:46:47,815
<i>The knowledge...</i>

267
00:46:49,089 --> 00:46:52,252
<i>... that I have of matters,
physical and historical...</i>

268
00:46:52,759 --> 00:46:55,956
<i>... I have given you fully on your voyage
to your new home.</i>

269
00:46:57,197 --> 00:46:59,358
<i>These are important matters to be sure...</i>

270
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:02,429
<i>... but still matters of mere fact.</i>

271
00:47:04,171 --> 00:47:06,002
<i>There are questions to be asked...</i>

272
00:47:07,107 --> 00:47:09,735
<i>... and it is time for you to do so.</i>

273
00:47:12,713 --> 00:47:13,907
<i>Here, in this...</i>

274
00:47:15,382 --> 00:47:17,907
<i>... this fortress of solitude...</i>

275
00:47:19,653 --> 00:47:21,917
<i>... we shall try to find the answers together.</i>

276
00:47:24,024 --> 00:47:25,184
<i>So, my son...</i>

277
00:47:26,627 --> 00:47:27,457
<i>... speak.</i>

278
00:47:29,463 --> 00:47:30,259
Who am I?

279
00:47:31,665 --> 00:47:32,962
<i>Your name is Kal-El.</i>

280
00:47:34,635 --> 00:47:37,729
<i>You are the only survivor
of the Planet Krypton.</i>

281
00:47:38,705 --> 00:47:42,664
<i>Even though you were raised
as a human, you are not one of them.</i>

282
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:47,675
<i>You have great powers,
only some of which you have...</i>

283
00:47:48,315 --> 00:47:49,714
<i>... as yet discovered.</i>

284
00:47:52,686 --> 00:47:54,278
<i>Come with me now, my son...</i>

285
00:47:54,354 --> 00:47:57,323
<i>... as we break through the bars
of your earthly confinement.</i>

286
00:47:57,391 --> 00:47:59,518
<i>Traveling through time and space.</i>

287
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:04,859
<i>Your powers will far exceed
those of mortal men.</i>

288
00:48:04,932 --> 00:48:07,696
<i>It is forbidden for you to interfere
with human history.</i>

289
00:48:07,834 --> 00:48:10,997
<i>Rather let your leadership stir others to.</i>

290
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:16,842
<i>In the next year,
we shall examine the human heart.</i>

291
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:20,037
<i>It is more fragile than your own.</i>

292
00:48:22,282 --> 00:48:26,241
<i>As we pass through the flaming turmoil
which is the edge of your own galaxy...</i>

293
00:48:26,954 --> 00:48:29,479
<i>... we will enter the realm
of the red Krypton sun...</i>

294
00:48:29,556 --> 00:48:31,888
<i>... source of your strength
and nourishment...</i>

295
00:48:32,092 --> 00:48:34,492
<i>... and cause of our eventual destruction.</i>

296
00:48:35,963 --> 00:48:38,454
<i>The Planet Krypton, my son...</i>

297
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:41,528
<i>... your home as it was.</i>

298
00:48:43,637 --> 00:48:47,437
<i>This year we shall examine
the various concepts of immortality...</i>

299
00:48:47,874 --> 00:48:49,842
<i>... and their basis in actual fact.</i>

300
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:55,141
<i>The total accumulation of all knowledge
spanning the 28 known galaxies...</i>

301
00:48:55,649 --> 00:48:58,812
<i>... is embedded in the crystals
which I have sent along with you.</i>

302
00:48:59,219 --> 00:49:00,846
<i>Study them well, my son.</i>

303
00:49:04,458 --> 00:49:07,552
<i>By the time you return to the confines
of your galaxy...</i>

304
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:10,223
<i>... twelve of your years will have passed.</i>

305
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:12,627
<i>For this reason, among others...</i>

306
00:49:13,767 --> 00:49:15,735
<i>... I have chosen Earth for you.</i>

307
00:49:16,003 --> 00:49:18,801
<i>It is now time for you to rejoin
your new world...</i>

308
00:49:19,673 --> 00:49:21,971
<i>... and to serve its collective humanity.</i>

309
00:49:23,443 --> 00:49:25,434
<i>Live as one of them, Kal-El...</i>

310
00:49:26,279 --> 00:49:29,271
<i>... and discover where your strength
and your power are needed.</i>

311
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:34,380
<i>But always hold in your heart the pride
of your special heritage.</i>

312
00:49:35,756 --> 00:49:38,452
<i>They can be a great people, Kal-El,
they wish to be.</i>

313
00:49:39,526 --> 00:49:41,824
<i>They only lack the light to show the way.</i>

314
00:49:43,797 --> 00:49:46,925
<i>For this reason, above all,
their capacity for good...</i>

315
00:49:48,435 --> 00:49:49,925
<i>... I have sent them you...</i>

316
00:49:52,272 --> 00:49:53,364
<i>... my only son.</i>

317
00:50:29,743 --> 00:50:32,371
<i>Okay, this is it, mac, the Daily Planet.</i>

318
00:50:32,913 --> 00:50:36,713
Fresh fruit!
Hey, how about a tomato, lady?

319
00:50:37,317 --> 00:50:39,478
Hey, fresh fruit and vegetables.

320
00:51:11,885 --> 00:51:12,817
Smile.

321
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:17,085
How many "T's" in "bloodletting"?

322
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:18,088
Two.

323
00:51:24,631 --> 00:51:25,962
What are you writing?

324
00:51:26,066 --> 00:51:28,330
An ode to spring.
How do you spell "massacre"?

325
00:51:29,369 --> 00:51:33,806
M-a-s-s-a-c-r-e.

326
00:51:34,474 --> 00:51:35,498
Thanks.

327
00:51:35,742 --> 00:51:38,267
Golly, how come you get
all the great stories?

328
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:40,506
A good reporter doesn't get great stories.

329
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:42,047
A good reporter makes them great.

330
00:51:42,115 --> 00:51:44,208
Chief, here's that story on the murder case.

331
00:51:44,284 --> 00:51:47,617
The way I see it, it's a headline
on the front page with my picture...

332
00:51:47,687 --> 00:51:51,248
There's only one "P" in "rapist."
Lois Lane, say hello to Clark Kent.

333
00:51:51,691 --> 00:51:53,181
Hello, Miss Lane, how are...

334
00:51:57,597 --> 00:51:59,758
How are you doing?
Jimmy Olsen, photographer.

335
00:51:59,833 --> 00:52:01,664
Hi. Clark Kent. Nice to meet you.

336
00:52:03,236 --> 00:52:05,830
It's got everything:
Sex, violence, the ethnic angle.

337
00:52:06,106 --> 00:52:08,506
So does a lady wrestler
with a foreign accent.

338
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:10,736
- Kent, can you open this?
- Sure, Mr. White.

339
00:52:10,811 --> 00:52:13,075
This could be the basis
for a series of articles:

340
00:52:13,146 --> 00:52:15,910
"Making Sense of Senseless Killings"
by Lois Lane.

341
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:18,844
We get psychologists,
sociologists, interviews...

342
00:52:18,919 --> 00:52:22,377
Lois, you're pushing a bunch
of rinky-dink tabloid garbage.

343
00:52:22,722 --> 00:52:24,747
<i>The Daily Planet has a tradition...</i>

344
00:52:24,825 --> 00:52:26,292
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

345
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:29,194
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to shake it up like that.

346
00:52:29,796 --> 00:52:31,093
Of course not, Lois.

347
00:52:31,698 --> 00:52:34,826
Why would any one want to make
a total stranger look like a fool?

348
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:38,128
I'll take that.

349
00:52:38,205 --> 00:52:40,070
Thanks. I'm sorry, Mr. White.

350
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:43,701
Why do I pay you $40 a week when
I should have you arrested for loitering?

351
00:52:43,777 --> 00:52:45,301
- Go get Mr... a towel.
- Kent.

352
00:52:45,378 --> 00:52:46,868
- Move, kid, move.
- Right, Chief.

353
00:52:46,947 --> 00:52:49,006
- Make mine black, no sugar.
- Right, Chief.

354
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:50,549
And don't call me sugar.

355
00:52:51,885 --> 00:52:53,614
Right... Sugar.

356
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:56,482
Chief wants coffee, no sugar.
I'll take tea with lemon.

357
00:52:57,691 --> 00:53:01,024
Lois, why don't you take Kent out
to meet everybody, huh?

358
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:03,995
Just introduce him around.
He's starting on the paper today.

359
00:53:04,197 --> 00:53:05,789
I'm giving him the City beat.

360
00:53:06,566 --> 00:53:07,362
Chief!

361
00:53:08,101 --> 00:53:09,568
That's my beat!

362
00:53:09,970 --> 00:53:13,599
Lois, Clark Kent may seem like
just a mild-mannered reporter...

363
00:53:13,807 --> 00:53:17,868
...but not only does he know how to treat
his Chief with the proper respect...

364
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:20,674
...not only does he have a snappy,
punchy prose style...

365
00:53:20,747 --> 00:53:24,740
...but he is, in my 40 years in this business,
the fastest typist I have ever seen.

366
00:53:24,818 --> 00:53:25,807
That's great.

367
00:53:26,586 --> 00:53:28,315
Here, you forgot my article.

368
00:53:32,025 --> 00:53:34,289
Excuse me, Mr. White. I was wondering...

369
00:53:34,394 --> 00:53:36,794
...if you could arrange for half my salary...

370
00:53:36,997 --> 00:53:39,397
...to be sent to this address
on a weekly basis.

371
00:53:39,866 --> 00:53:40,696
Your bookie, right?

372
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:41,562
My what?

373
00:53:41,668 --> 00:53:42,657
Don't tell me!

374
00:53:42,736 --> 00:53:45,671
He sends a check every week
to his sweet, gray-haired mother.

375
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:47,466
Actually, she's silver-haired.

376
00:53:49,709 --> 00:53:51,176
I'll see what I can do.

377
00:53:51,912 --> 00:53:53,709
Thank you very much, Mr. White.

378
00:53:58,184 --> 00:53:58,878
Well?

379
00:54:00,887 --> 00:54:02,354
Any more at home like you?

380
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:04,282
Not really, no.

381
00:54:07,427 --> 00:54:08,724
I didn't think so.

382
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:12,628
Well, get yourself a desk over here.

383
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,389
Over here?

384
00:54:14,467 --> 00:54:17,231
Here, there's some paper
and a file right there.

385
00:54:17,404 --> 00:54:18,336
Sorry.

386
00:54:35,288 --> 00:54:38,052
- Hi, Bill Breesen.
- Hi, Clark Kent.

387
00:54:38,124 --> 00:54:40,456
- Nice to meet you.
- Welcome aboard.

388
00:54:41,294 --> 00:54:44,457
- Here's your towel, Mr. Clark.
- Kent.

389
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:45,555
- What?
- Kent.

390
00:54:46,633 --> 00:54:48,533
- Clark Kent.
- Jimmy Olsen.

391
00:54:54,808 --> 00:54:57,777
- I met this really great guy, you know.
- Hey, fabulous.

392
00:54:57,844 --> 00:55:01,280
We had this fabulous weekend.
I met him at this dude ranch.

393
00:55:01,348 --> 00:55:02,975
I haven't been since I was seven.

394
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:05,916
- I got to mail these letters.
- Good luck tonight.

395
00:55:05,986 --> 00:55:07,476
- Hi, Clark.
- Hi, Lois.

396
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:09,988
How did you like your first day on the job?

397
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:13,284
The hours were sort of longer
than I expected...

398
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:16,625
...but on the whole, meeting you
and Jimmy Olsen and Mr. White...

399
00:55:16,696 --> 00:55:18,857
Gosh, on a whole, I'd say it's been swell.

400
00:55:18,932 --> 00:55:20,297
- "Swell"?
- Yup.

401
00:55:22,235 --> 00:55:23,395
You know, Clark...

402
00:55:24,771 --> 00:55:27,205
...there are very few people left
in the world...

403
00:55:27,273 --> 00:55:29,332
...who feel comfortable saying that word.

404
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:30,671
- What word?
- Swell.

405
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:33,269
Really? I always thought
it was kind of natural.

406
00:55:35,515 --> 00:55:37,210
- Sorry.
- Clark.

407
00:55:40,954 --> 00:55:42,512
- Sorry, Lois.
- Hi, Rex.

408
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:45,789
- Did you see anything good today?
- Not until you came along.

409
00:55:46,059 --> 00:55:47,151
Rex, this is...

410
00:55:47,227 --> 00:55:49,195
- Clark Kent. How do...
- See you around.

411
00:55:51,464 --> 00:55:52,328
Lois?

412
00:55:53,366 --> 00:55:54,697
Hey, where you going?

413
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:56,167
Can I help you with your coat?

414
00:55:56,236 --> 00:55:58,033
- Thanks. Can you get that?
- Sure.

415
00:55:58,104 --> 00:55:59,503
Did you like Mr. White?

416
00:55:59,572 --> 00:56:01,836
He was a nice guy
and Jimmy was fantastic.

417
00:56:02,675 --> 00:56:04,438
Come here. Come on.

418
00:56:04,511 --> 00:56:06,103
Get in here, hurry up. Come on.

419
00:56:06,179 --> 00:56:09,410
- We'd better get out of here.
- We'd better do what he says, Lois.

420
00:56:09,682 --> 00:56:11,206
Come on, get in here, quick.

421
00:56:11,284 --> 00:56:14,185
Don't, don't do anything.
It's all right, I'm coming.

422
00:56:14,287 --> 00:56:15,549
We're coming.

423
00:56:15,722 --> 00:56:16,746
Excuse me.

424
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:18,215
- Here?
- Yeah, yeah.

425
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:21,317
Don't point that at me, sir.
You could hurt somebody with that.

426
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:24,221
Okay, okay. Hold it there.

427
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:25,453
Just a minute.

428
00:56:25,732 --> 00:56:26,994
Now I realize that...

429
00:56:27,067 --> 00:56:30,366
...times are tough for some these days,
but this isn't the answer.

430
00:56:30,437 --> 00:56:33,804
You can't solve society's problems
with a gun.

431
00:56:34,874 --> 00:56:36,466
You know, buddy, you're right.

432
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:40,405
- I'm going to turn over a new leaf.
- Good for you, sir. That's the spirit.

433
00:56:40,513 --> 00:56:42,538
He doesn't really want to hurt anyone.

434
00:56:43,416 --> 00:56:45,543
Right after I rip off this lady's purse.

435
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:46,482
Of course!

436
00:56:46,886 --> 00:56:48,581
Now come on, lady, hand it over.

437
00:56:49,022 --> 00:56:50,956
Lois, I think you'd better...

438
00:56:55,428 --> 00:56:57,020
Lois! What are you doing?

439
00:57:15,415 --> 00:57:16,814
Are you all right?

440
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:18,909
What happened?

441
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:23,050
- Golly, I guess I must have fainted.
- Fainted?

442
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:25,953
- You fainted!
- I'm sorry.

443
00:57:39,906 --> 00:57:42,374
Really, Lois,
supposing that man had shot you?

444
00:57:42,442 --> 00:57:44,501
Is it worth risking your life over $10...

445
00:57:44,577 --> 00:57:46,943
...two credit cards,
a hairbrush and a lipstick?

446
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:49,577
- How did you know that?
- Know what?

447
00:57:51,351 --> 00:57:53,683
You described the exact contents
of my purse.

448
00:57:58,057 --> 00:57:58,955
Wild guess.

449
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:03,692
Taxi!

450
00:58:08,635 --> 00:58:10,000
- Hey!
- Hi, Otis.

451
00:58:21,414 --> 00:58:23,075
So, what's happening, partner?

452
00:58:23,283 --> 00:58:24,477
Look what we got.

453
00:58:25,051 --> 00:58:26,109
Let's take him.

454
00:58:26,319 --> 00:58:27,786
Wait a minute.

455
00:58:27,854 --> 00:58:30,118
Maybe he'll lead us to the big man himself.

456
00:58:30,490 --> 00:58:31,479
Lex Luthor?

457
00:58:31,858 --> 00:58:33,120
You got it, Aramus.

458
00:58:34,394 --> 00:58:36,191
We'll make Captain by midnight.

459
00:58:38,264 --> 00:58:42,030
Hey, what do you read?
XK-101 rocket to be used.

460
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:44,403
Hey, what do you read?

461
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:46,500
- Hey, Matt.
- Hi, Otis.

462
00:58:46,573 --> 00:58:48,473
<i>Just getting a Daily Planet here.</i>

463
00:58:54,514 --> 00:58:55,947
Okay. All right.

464
00:58:56,482 --> 00:58:58,814
See, I'm paying him,
and I got a pretzel, too.

465
00:58:58,885 --> 00:58:59,977
Thanks, Otis.

466
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:02,117
How many bags, Shutzy?

467
00:59:05,124 --> 00:59:07,684
This is Metropolis 46. We're on foot.
Over and out.

468
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:08,893
Let's go.

469
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:16,299
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

470
00:59:16,369 --> 00:59:18,166
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

471
00:59:18,271 --> 00:59:21,536
<i>The Metropolis Flyer is now ready
for departure...</i>

472
00:59:21,908 --> 00:59:24,570
<i>... on the upper level. Track 6.</i>

473
00:59:26,446 --> 00:59:29,609
He's going down on a train platform.
I'm going after him.

474
00:59:29,682 --> 00:59:32,310
Okay, I'll call for backup.
Be careful now, will you?

475
00:59:32,385 --> 00:59:34,080
All right, Aramus. All right.

476
00:59:36,189 --> 00:59:38,419
<i>Now boarding on the lower level...</i>

477
00:59:38,958 --> 00:59:43,691
Now 10 minutes, air-conditioned cars,
Mount Vernon, Poughkeepsie...

478
00:59:44,030 --> 00:59:45,554
Board now. All aboard.

479
00:59:45,865 --> 00:59:49,392
Metropolis Transportation
to Buffalo, Syracuse...

480
00:59:50,436 --> 00:59:52,996
Smoking cars are forward,
move along now.

481
00:59:53,606 --> 00:59:54,868
Luggage at the top.

482
00:59:55,375 --> 00:59:58,367
Smoking cars are forward.
All aboard, boarding.

483
01:00:26,306 --> 01:00:28,706
Aramus, Aramus, make it Track 22.

484
01:00:29,142 --> 01:00:32,407
I've seen him and I'm right on him.
Lower level, Track 22.

485
01:01:09,515 --> 01:01:10,777
So that's it!

486
01:01:26,999 --> 01:01:30,696
It's amazing that brain can generate
enough power to keep those legs moving.

487
01:02:12,845 --> 01:02:13,641
Harry...

488
01:02:16,249 --> 01:02:18,410
Harry, where are you? Harry?

489
01:02:38,805 --> 01:02:39,533
Sick!

490
01:02:48,748 --> 01:02:50,375
Sick, you're really sick!

491
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:52,808
I'm sick, Ms. Teschmacher?

492
01:02:52,952 --> 01:02:55,978
Sick when we're days
from executing the crime of the century?

493
01:02:56,556 --> 01:02:58,854
No, no, no. Step away from that, please.

494
01:03:00,460 --> 01:03:04,089
How do you choose to congratulate
the greatest criminal mind of our time?

495
01:03:04,597 --> 01:03:06,394
Do you tell me that I'm brilliant?

496
01:03:06,466 --> 01:03:09,492
Oh, no, that would be too obvious,
I grant you.

497
01:03:09,735 --> 01:03:10,702
Charismatic?

498
01:03:11,304 --> 01:03:12,601
Fiendishly gifted?

499
01:03:13,806 --> 01:03:15,273
Try twisted!

500
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:23,173
Get away from that, get away!

501
01:03:25,284 --> 01:03:26,751
Tell me, Lex.

502
01:03:26,919 --> 01:03:29,945
Why do so many people have to die
for the crime of the century?

503
01:03:30,022 --> 01:03:31,319
Why? You ask why?

504
01:03:31,958 --> 01:03:34,791
Why does the phone always ring
when you're in the bathtub?

505
01:03:36,262 --> 01:03:39,561
Why is the most brilliantly diabolical leader
of our time...

506
01:03:40,266 --> 01:03:42,564
...surrounding himself
with total nincompoops?

507
01:03:42,635 --> 01:03:43,932
I'm back, Mr. Luthor.

508
01:03:44,637 --> 01:03:46,605
I was just talking about you.

509
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:49,107
You were followed again.

510
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:55,513
In spite of those cat-like reflexes.

511
01:04:00,486 --> 01:04:02,283
Mr. Luthor, I'm sorry.

512
01:04:04,924 --> 01:04:06,858
Is that the newspaper
I asked you to get me?

513
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:08,859
Yes.

514
01:04:09,795 --> 01:04:11,422
Then why am I not reading it?

515
01:04:13,332 --> 01:04:15,300
Because I haven't given it to you yet?

516
01:04:15,635 --> 01:04:16,431
Right.

517
01:04:21,641 --> 01:04:22,938
At last it's official.

518
01:04:24,010 --> 01:04:26,171
Thanks to the help of the US Government...

519
01:04:26,245 --> 01:04:30,045
...we are about to be involved in
the greatest real-estate swindle of all time.

520
01:04:30,383 --> 01:04:31,680
Lex, what is this...

521
01:04:31,751 --> 01:04:34,879
...obsession with real estate?
All the time, "land, land, land."

522
01:04:35,187 --> 01:04:38,054
When I was 6 years old,
my father said to me...

523
01:04:38,224 --> 01:04:39,054
"Get out!"

524
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:44,489
Before that, he said,
"Son, stocks may rise and fall...

525
01:04:44,564 --> 01:04:47,397
"...utilities and transportation systems
may collapse...

526
01:04:47,466 --> 01:04:50,560
"...people are no damn good,
but they'll always need land...

527
01:04:50,636 --> 01:04:52,968
"...they'll pay through the nose to get it."

528
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:55,269
- "Remember," my father said...
- "Land."

529
01:04:58,578 --> 01:05:00,944
It's a pity that he didn't see...

530
01:05:01,013 --> 01:05:03,948
...from such humble beginnings
how I've created this empire.

531
01:05:04,016 --> 01:05:05,313
An empire. This?

532
01:05:06,586 --> 01:05:11,216
How many girls do you know
have a Park Avenue address like this?

533
01:05:11,924 --> 01:05:15,052
Park Avenue address, 200 feet below?

534
01:05:15,394 --> 01:05:18,056
Do you realize
what people are shelling out up there...

535
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:20,925
...for a few miserable rooms
off a common elevator.

536
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:23,434
What more could anyone ask?

537
01:05:31,544 --> 01:05:34,513
Get this Loch Ness update
right into composing.

538
01:05:34,914 --> 01:05:38,042
Yeah. No, that's it, Roth.
Put it to bed. Right.

539
01:05:38,851 --> 01:05:41,115
- Why are you standing here for?
- I'm not.

540
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:43,648
- I wasn't going to say it.
- Go.

541
01:05:48,761 --> 01:05:50,729
The sex maniac profile.

542
01:05:50,930 --> 01:05:54,195
Right. Nine to five it's
a Pulitzer Prize winner. What do you bet?

543
01:05:54,266 --> 01:05:55,893
There's no "Z" in "brassiere."

544
01:05:56,102 --> 01:05:58,400
Nice job on that union scandal, Kent.

545
01:05:58,704 --> 01:06:00,103
Gosh, thanks, Mr. White.

546
01:06:04,877 --> 01:06:06,208
Hi, Clark. Good night.

547
01:06:06,278 --> 01:06:09,076
- Here, let me carry that for you.
- Thanks a lot.

548
01:06:09,281 --> 01:06:11,249
Lois, have you got a minute?

549
01:06:11,751 --> 01:06:12,877
Excuse me, please.

550
01:06:14,153 --> 01:06:17,520
And these two go to the addresses
on the envelope, okay?

551
01:06:18,391 --> 01:06:20,655
I was wondering
if you'd have dinner with me?

552
01:06:20,726 --> 01:06:22,660
I'm sorry, I'm booked.

553
01:06:23,396 --> 01:06:27,196
Air Force One is landing at the airport.
This kid'll be there to make sure...

554
01:06:27,266 --> 01:06:30,326
...you-know-who answers the questions
he would rather duck.

555
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:31,768
Don't you ever let up?

556
01:06:32,004 --> 01:06:34,905
What for? I mean I've seen
how the other half lives.

557
01:06:35,007 --> 01:06:38,841
My sister, for instance.
Three kids, two cats, and one mortgage.

558
01:06:39,412 --> 01:06:41,243
I would go bananas in a week.

559
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:44,178
- Can I take you to the airport?
- Not unless you can fly.

560
01:06:47,453 --> 01:06:50,217
"Ladies." I have to change, thank you.
Goodbye.

561
01:06:50,289 --> 01:06:51,483
Maybe we could...

562
01:06:59,131 --> 01:07:02,032
- Would you mail that for me? Thanks.
- Sure.

563
01:07:02,268 --> 01:07:03,257
Good night.

564
01:07:08,941 --> 01:07:11,273
Going down, please, going down.

565
01:07:14,647 --> 01:07:15,705
Going down?

566
01:07:15,781 --> 01:07:17,146
Going up. Up, up.

567
01:07:19,118 --> 01:07:20,107
Good night.

568
01:07:32,231 --> 01:07:34,392
<i>Daily Planet, Copter One. This is ground.</i>

569
01:07:34,467 --> 01:07:35,832
<i>Planet One, go ahead.</i>

570
01:07:36,035 --> 01:07:40,404
<i>Miss Lane is here for a ride to the airport
to meet Air Force One. It's a hurry flight.</i>

571
01:07:40,806 --> 01:07:44,867
<i>We're on our way over the river.
Have one aboard for transfer. Over.</i>

572
01:07:45,211 --> 01:07:50,012
<i>Roger, Planet One. You're clear to land.
Wind 0-2-0-1-5. Altimeter 2-9-8-9.</i>

573
01:07:50,382 --> 01:07:51,679
<i>Roger, Over and out.</i>

574
01:08:52,945 --> 01:08:54,537
A malfunction, can't get lift off.

575
01:08:54,613 --> 01:08:57,081
<i>- You've hooked a cable.
- What's happening?</i>

576
01:08:58,651 --> 01:08:59,675
<i>Set it down.</i>

577
01:08:59,752 --> 01:09:01,549
My God, we've lost motor control.

578
01:09:01,620 --> 01:09:02,712
I can't hold it.

579
01:09:09,395 --> 01:09:10,487
I can't hold it.

580
01:09:11,931 --> 01:09:12,898
He's lost it.

581
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:28,578
Wake up.

582
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:33,377
Help!

583
01:09:52,004 --> 01:09:53,301
Step back, folks.

584
01:09:54,039 --> 01:09:56,599
Get back. Move over
to the other side of the street.

585
01:09:59,578 --> 01:10:02,411
Bring the canvas here. Get it up there.

586
01:10:02,648 --> 01:10:04,206
There's helicopter up there.

587
01:10:10,589 --> 01:10:11,647
Help me.

588
01:10:20,499 --> 01:10:22,865
All right, folks. Let's move back.

589
01:10:23,836 --> 01:10:25,463
Let these firemen get in here.

590
01:10:28,307 --> 01:10:29,069
Help me!

591
01:10:35,347 --> 01:10:36,644
Hold it. Get back.

592
01:10:40,719 --> 01:10:42,710
Get off the street, folks.

593
01:10:57,236 --> 01:11:00,535
All right, get along there.
Get away from the side of the building.

594
01:11:03,275 --> 01:11:05,402
Hold these crowds back. Move.

595
01:11:07,947 --> 01:11:08,743
Help!

596
01:11:25,397 --> 01:11:26,364
Say, Jim...

597
01:11:27,032 --> 01:11:27,862
Excuse me.

598
01:11:27,933 --> 01:11:29,400
That's a bad outfit.

599
01:11:31,103 --> 01:11:32,570
Okay, move these people.

600
01:11:42,414 --> 01:11:43,881
Oh, my God! Look up there.

601
01:11:45,884 --> 01:11:47,146
What the hell's that?

602
01:11:49,288 --> 01:11:50,812
Easy, miss. I've got you.

603
01:11:50,923 --> 01:11:53,892
You've got me? Who's got you?

604
01:11:55,661 --> 01:11:59,620
I can't believe it, I just cannot believe it.
He got her.

605
01:12:44,443 --> 01:12:46,468
Gentlemen, this man needs help.

606
01:12:48,447 --> 01:12:51,473
I hope this little incident
hasn't put you off flying, miss.

607
01:12:53,218 --> 01:12:56,654
Statistically speaking, of course,
it's still the safest way to travel.

608
01:12:57,856 --> 01:12:58,652
Right.

609
01:12:59,725 --> 01:13:00,714
Wait!

610
01:13:05,397 --> 01:13:06,523
Who are you?

611
01:13:07,466 --> 01:13:08,433
A friend.

612
01:13:13,772 --> 01:13:14,761
'Bye.

613
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:30,111
Something wrong with the elevator?

614
01:14:37,589 --> 01:14:38,521
Going down?

615
01:14:51,303 --> 01:14:52,201
Officer.

616
01:14:55,607 --> 01:14:57,939
Good evening, Officer Mooney.

617
01:14:58,677 --> 01:15:00,804
They say confession is good for the soul.

618
01:15:02,681 --> 01:15:05,650
I'd listen...
