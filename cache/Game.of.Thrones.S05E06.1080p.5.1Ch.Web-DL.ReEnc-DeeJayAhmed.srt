Get back to work.

4
00:03:57,864 --> 00:04:00,435
No. I've been here for weeks.

5
00:04:00,504 --> 00:04:04,714
I'm not scrubbing one more corpse
until you tell me why I'm doing it.

6
00:04:04,784 --> 00:04:06,832
You will know why.

7
00:04:06,904 --> 00:04:10,113
- When?
- When it's time, not before.

8
00:04:11,024 --> 00:04:12,310
Get back to work.

9
00:04:12,384 --> 00:04:15,274
- When do I get to play the game?
- Game?

10
00:04:15,344 --> 00:04:18,154
The game. The Game of Faces.

11
00:04:18,904 --> 00:04:21,555
You tried already. You failed.

12
00:04:21,624 --> 00:04:22,750
I didn't even know I was playing.

13
00:04:22,824 --> 00:04:24,428

What are you doing here?
How did you get here?

18
00:04:35,584 --> 00:04:38,872
I'm from Westeros, just like you.

19
00:04:40,024 --> 00:04:42,504
Daughter of a lord, just like you.

20
00:04:43,624 --> 00:04:45,433
Except I was an only child.

21
00:04:45,904 --> 00:04:47,872
Heir to his fortune.

22
00:04:49,104 --> 00:04:50,515
My mother died.

23
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:55,345
My father remarried,
and his new wife gave birth to a girl.

24
00:04:56,944 --> 00:05:00,869
My stepmother didn't want any rivals
for her precious daughter,

25
00:05:01,184 --> 00:05:03,266
so she tried to kill me with poison.

26
00:05:03,824 --> 00:05:05,394
I found out.

27
00:05:05,464 --> 00:05:07,671
Sought help from the Faceless Men.

28
00:05:10,304 --> 00:05:12,830
And my father was widowed again.

29
00:05:14,544 --> 00:05:16,706
I've been serving them ever since.

30
00:05:28,064 --> 00:05:31,193
Was that true or a lie?

Westeros.

40
00:06:27,384 --> 00:06:29,273
My family home is Winterfell.

41
00:06:29,544 --> 00:06:32,991
I'm the youngest daughter of a great lord,
Eddard Stark.

42
00:06:33,384 --> 00:06:34,545
He died in battle.

(GASPS)

A lie.

45
00:06:37,384 --> 00:06:40,433
After he was executed, I fled the capital.

46
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:43,673
Had to kill a stable boy.

A lie.

00:06:49,144 --> 00:06:50,555
I stabbed him in the gut.

51
00:06:51,104 --> 00:06:54,711
I tried to find my mother and brother,
but I never did.

52
00:06:54,784 --> 00:06:57,105
They were murdered by Walder Frey.

53
00:06:58,344 --> 00:07:00,870
An outlaw kidnapped me,
a man called Polliver.

A man called the Hound. Sandor Clegane.

56
00:07:06,504 --> 00:07:08,666
He tried to sell me,
but was wounded in a fight.

57
00:07:08,904 --> 00:07:12,272
He begged me to kill him, but I wouldn't.
I left him in the mountains to die.

58
00:07:12,664 --> 00:07:14,871
I wanted him to suffer. I hated him.

59
00:07:17,584 --> 00:07:18,631
I hated him.

60
00:07:20,384 --> 00:07:21,954
That's not a lie!

61
00:07:23,384 --> 00:07:26,308

00:07:26,384 --> 00:07:29,786

63

Yes.

So, those villages we
were supposed to find?

69
00:08:10,264 --> 00:08:12,073
We can't live on berries and roots.

70
00:08:12,144 --> 00:08:13,145

71
00:08:14,984 --> 00:08:16,270

Of course I'm hungry.

Possibly the least charming
man I've ever met.

75
00:08:23,624 --> 00:08:25,194
I'm not your traveling companion.

We are traveling together
in each other's company, therefore...

Do you ever shut up?

78
00:08:30,944 --> 00:08:33,948
I sailed from King's Landing to Pentos
in a crate

79
00:08:34,304 --> 00:08:36,910
without ever saying a word.

Why?

81
00:08:41,544 --> 00:08:44,354
It never occurred to you
to ask why until now?

82
00:08:46,664 --> 00:08:51,033
You never wondered why Tyrion Lannister
decided to visit a brothel in Volantis?

83
00:08:51,144 --> 00:08:54,387
I'm sure you visited many brothels
in many cities.

84
00:08:56,824 --> 00:08:57,985
I killed my father.

85
00:09:00,704 --> 00:09:04,106
He wanted to execute me
for a crime I didn't commit.

86
00:09:06,744 --> 00:09:08,746
And he was fucking the woman I loved.

As miserable as you are, Mormont,
at least your father was a good man.

TYRION: I met him. I visited the Wall.

90
00:09:27,864 --> 00:09:30,151
When I asked him about his men,

91
00:09:31,264 --> 00:09:33,505
he knew all their stories,
every one of them.

92
00:09:33,904 --> 00:09:37,033
He actually cared about the people
under his command.

"We shall never see his like again."

Oh, you didn't know.

00:10:01,904 --> 00:10:04,635
I'm sorry. I am.

00:10:07,424 --> 00:10:08,471
How?

98
00:10:10,584 --> 00:10:11,995
I only know what I heard.

How?

100
00:10:13,424 --> 00:10:15,665
He was leading
an expedition beyond the Wall.

101
00:10:16,944 --> 00:10:18,594
There was a mutiny.

102
00:10:19,864 --> 00:10:21,514
He was murdered by his own men.

103
00:10:33,224 --> 00:10:34,874

But my father never gave up on me.

He loved me

more than anything in the world,
just like your father loves you.

My father prayed to the Many-Faced God,

and I drank the water from his fountain.

No.

A girl is not ready to become no one.

138
00:16:43,904 --> 00:16:46,145
But she is ready to become someone else.

139

Why Daenerys? Why is she worth all this?

140
00:17:04,584 --> 00:17:05,870
As I recall,

141
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:09,272
the Mormonts fought against the Targaryens
during Robert's Rebellion.

Do you believe in anything?

I believe in lots of things.

- No.
- Neither did I.

148
00:17:24,184 --> 00:17:26,630
I was a cynic, just like you.

149
00:17:27,064 --> 00:17:31,149
Then I saw a girl step into a great fire
with three stone eggs.

150
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:34,867
When the fire burned out,
I thought I'd find her blackened bones.

151
00:17:35,224 --> 00:17:38,910
Instead, I saw her, Daenerys,

152
00:17:38,984 --> 00:17:42,955
alive and unhurt, holding her baby dragons.

153
00:17:45,544 --> 00:17:48,024
Have you ever heard baby dragons singing?

No.

00:17:50,144 --> 00:17:52,067
It's hard to be a cynic after that.

156

Doesn't mean she's going
to be a great queen.

No, it doesn't.

158
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:00,865
The Targaryens are famously insane.

159
00:18:01,024 --> 00:18:03,675
What if she conquers the world? Then what?

160
00:18:03,744 --> 00:18:06,111
A thousand years of peace and prosperity?

you bring her this enemy dwarf.

and restores your position.

defeat all your enemies,

and watch her climb those steps
and sit on the Iron Throne.

168
00:18:25,424 --> 00:18:27,825
Hurrah. Long live the queen. Then what?

169
00:18:28,264 --> 00:18:29,311
Then she rules.

170
00:18:29,944 --> 00:18:33,232
So, a woman who has not spent
a single day of her adult life in Westeros

171
00:18:33,304 --> 00:18:35,432
becomes the ruler of Westeros?
That's justice?

172
00:18:35,704 --> 00:18:38,071
- JORAH: She's the rightful heir.
- Why?

173
00:18:38,144 --> 00:18:41,830
Because her father, who burned
living men for amusement, was the king?

174
00:18:45,144 --> 00:18:47,545
- That's a slave ship.
- Why are they anchored?

175
00:18:47,864 --> 00:18:49,389
They probably came ashore for...

176
00:18:49,504 --> 00:18:50,869
- (SWORDS SCRAPING)

- (MAN LAUGHS)

178
00:19:02,504 --> 00:19:04,313
Got a lot of fight in you, huh?

179
00:19:06,384 --> 00:19:07,385
(GRUNTS)

180
00:19:07,464 --> 00:19:08,625
(CHUCKLES)

181
00:19:13,544 --> 00:19:14,909
Salt mines?

182
00:19:15,544 --> 00:19:18,787
Yeah, that or a galley slave.

183
00:19:19,064 --> 00:19:20,873
He looks strong enough.

184
00:19:20,944 --> 00:19:22,833
What about the dwarf?

185
00:19:23,464 --> 00:19:24,511
Worthless.

186
00:19:27,104 --> 00:19:28,105
Cut his throat.

187
00:19:28,184 --> 00:19:30,710
Wait. Wait. Wait, wait, wait!
Let's discuss this.

188
00:19:30,784 --> 00:19:32,229
And then chop off his cock.

189
00:19:32,984 --> 00:19:34,395
We'll sell it for a fortune.

190
00:19:34,504 --> 00:19:36,506
A dwarf's cock has magic powers.

191
00:19:37,464 --> 00:19:39,910
Wait! Wait! Wait, wait, Wait!

192
00:19:39,984 --> 00:19:44,512
You can't just hand a dry cock to a
merchant and expect him to pay for it.

193
00:19:44,704 --> 00:19:46,433
He has to know it came from a dwarf.

194
00:19:46,504 --> 00:19:49,826
And how could he know
unless he sees the dwarf?

195
00:19:49,904 --> 00:19:51,668
It will be a dwarf-sized cock.

196
00:19:51,744 --> 00:19:53,667
Guess again.

197
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,947
The dwarf lives until we
find a cock merchant.

198
00:20:02,464 --> 00:20:03,795
(EXHALES)

199
00:20:10,504 --> 00:20:12,666
Queen Daenerys has outlawed slavery.

200
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:15,827
We're bound for Volantis, not Slaver's Bay.

201
00:20:16,864 --> 00:20:19,390
Besides, she reopened the fighting pits.

202
00:20:19,544 --> 00:20:22,229
I've never heard of free men
fighting in the pits.

203
00:20:22,824 --> 00:20:24,633
TYRION: The fighting pits in Meereen?

204
00:20:24,744 --> 00:20:27,145
You're in luck, then.
You're about to be rich.

205
00:20:27,824 --> 00:20:31,033
You are looking at one of the great
warriors in the Seven Kingdoms.

206
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,190
(LAUGHS)

207
00:20:33,264 --> 00:20:34,265
Him.

208
00:20:35,104 --> 00:20:36,105
Him?

209
00:20:36,824 --> 00:20:38,906
He's got to be 60 years old.

210
00:20:39,704 --> 00:20:43,993
Sure, he's a bit long in the tooth,
a bit withered, been in the sun too long.

211
00:20:44,064 --> 00:20:47,955
We can all see that.
But he is a veteran of 100 battles.

212
00:20:48,024 --> 00:20:50,186
They wrote songs about him.

213
00:20:56,704 --> 00:20:57,944
That true?

214
00:21:03,984 --> 00:21:08,273
He won the tournament at Lannisport,
unseating Ser Jaime Lannister himself.

215
00:21:10,424 --> 00:21:11,425
(LAUGHS)

216
00:21:12,384 --> 00:21:13,510
The Kingslayer.

217
00:21:13,584 --> 00:21:16,747
Jousting. You're talking about jousting.

218
00:21:16,824 --> 00:21:19,350
A fancy game for fancy lads.

219
00:21:19,424 --> 00:21:21,995
The men who fight in the pits of Meereen
will swallow him whole.

220
00:21:22,064 --> 00:21:24,635
JORAH: I killed a Dothraki bloodrider
in single combat.

221
00:21:35,624 --> 00:21:36,910
Liar.

222
00:21:36,984 --> 00:21:39,715
It's no lie. His name was Qotho.

223
00:21:39,784 --> 00:21:42,105
He was bloodrider to Khal Drogo.

224
00:21:42,984 --> 00:21:46,670
Take me to Slaver's Bay,
put a sword in my hand,

225
00:21:46,744 --> 00:21:47,950
I'll prove my worth.

226
00:21:55,144 --> 00:21:56,350
(LAUGHING)

227
00:21:57,504 --> 00:21:59,984
- (SEAGULLS SCREECHING)
- (BELL RINGING)

228
00:22:00,064 --> 00:22:03,147
For my children. Money.

229
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:07,831
Lord Baelish.

230
00:22:08,904 --> 00:22:09,951
Yes?

231
00:22:12,424 --> 00:22:14,472
Lancel Lannister.

232
00:22:16,704 --> 00:22:18,593
Brother Lancel.

233
00:22:18,664 --> 00:22:20,075
We abandon our family names.

234
00:22:20,304 --> 00:22:21,908
That's quite a family to abandon.

235
00:22:22,344 --> 00:22:25,154
The city has changed
since you were here last.

236
00:22:25,224 --> 00:22:26,988
We flooded the gutters with wine,

237
00:22:27,264 --> 00:22:29,744
smashed the false idols,

238
00:22:29,824 --> 00:22:31,633
and set the godless on the run.

239
00:22:32,464 --> 00:22:33,511
Well done.

240
00:22:39,264 --> 00:22:41,392
I'm here on urgent business
for the Queen Mother.

241
00:22:42,664 --> 00:22:45,065
Should I send word that I'll be delayed?

242
00:22:49,304 --> 00:22:50,794
Step carefully, Lord Baelish.

243
00:22:50,864 --> 00:22:54,755
You'll find there's little tolerance for
flesh peddlers in the new King's Landing.

244
00:22:54,824 --> 00:22:57,794
We both peddle fantasies, Brother Lancel.

245
00:22:57,864 --> 00:23:00,310
Mine just happen to be entertaining.

246
00:23:09,744 --> 00:23:12,395
Do you think it's wise, Your Grace,

247
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:14,629
arresting the heir to Highgarden?

248
00:23:14,704 --> 00:23:17,469
The Faith arrested the heir to Highgarden.

249
00:23:17,544 --> 00:23:20,593
Of course, and the Faith
were armed on your orders.

250
00:23:20,704 --> 00:23:22,354
The king's orders.

251
00:23:22,424 --> 00:23:24,552
Is the king to blame
for Ser Loras' perversion?

252
00:23:24,624 --> 00:23:26,547
House Tyrell won't tolerate this insult.

253
00:23:26,904 --> 00:23:28,872
House Tyrell won't tolerate it?

254
00:23:29,664 --> 00:23:31,792
I'm the insulted party, Lord Baelish.

255
00:23:31,864 --> 00:23:35,391
Ser Loras was promised to me.
Instead, he chose the company of boys.

256
00:23:35,464 --> 00:23:37,751
One's choice of companion
is a curious thing.

257
00:23:40,984 --> 00:23:42,065
Most curious.

258
00:23:44,584 --> 00:23:46,666
Lysa Arryn, for instance.

259
00:23:46,904 --> 00:23:48,508
A thoroughly repellant woman.

260
00:23:49,904 --> 00:23:51,394
Forgive me.

261
00:23:51,904 --> 00:23:53,827
I know you're still in mourning.

262
00:23:54,584 --> 00:23:58,634
Lysa was a good woman. A kind woman.

263
00:23:58,704 --> 00:24:01,355
She was neither of those things.
We both know it.

264
00:24:01,424 --> 00:24:03,233
Still, I pity her son.

265
00:24:03,824 --> 00:24:08,273
How fortunate the young Lord of the Vale
has a new father to counsel him.

266
00:24:08,344 --> 00:24:10,585
I know how hard it can be

267
00:24:10,664 --> 00:24:13,031
to lose both your parents
at such a young age.

268
00:24:13,104 --> 00:24:16,074
If war comes to Westeros, will the
Knights of the Vale fight for their king?

269
00:24:17,224 --> 00:24:19,670
Young Lord Robin heeds my advice,

270
00:24:20,784 --> 00:24:23,628
and I have always counseled
loyalty to the throne.

271
00:24:23,944 --> 00:24:25,275
Good.

272
00:24:30,064 --> 00:24:31,589
If there's nothing else.

273
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:34,754
There is another matter, Your Grace.

274
00:24:34,824 --> 00:24:37,350
Something so urgent
I couldn't trust the words to a raven.

275
00:24:37,744 --> 00:24:40,315
You once charged me with
finding Arya Stark.

276
00:24:40,504 --> 00:24:42,427
To my shame, I failed you.

277
00:24:43,584 --> 00:24:45,473
But I have found Sansa Stark.

278
00:24:47,424 --> 00:24:50,906
Alive and well and home again

279
00:24:50,984 --> 00:24:52,065
living at Winterfell.

280
00:24:52,464 --> 00:24:54,353
That's not possible.

281
00:24:54,504 --> 00:24:56,711
My sources are well placed.

282
00:24:58,264 --> 00:25:02,553
They tell me Roose Bolton
plans to marry her to his son, Ramsay,

283
00:25:02,624 --> 00:25:05,104
a bastard recently legitimized
by King Tommen.

284
00:25:05,304 --> 00:25:08,911
Roose Bolton is Warden of the North
by the grace of my father.

285
00:25:08,984 --> 00:25:12,955
Indeed, his reward
for stabbing his own king in the heart.

286
00:25:14,224 --> 00:25:16,545
We were fools to trust a turncloak.

287
00:25:16,904 --> 00:25:20,590
Marrying his son to the last of the Starks
gives him more legitimacy in the North

288
00:25:20,664 --> 00:25:22,826
than an alliance with a
hated southern house.

289
00:25:23,064 --> 00:25:28,230
I will skin him and his bastard
like that wretch on their bloody sigil.

290
00:25:28,304 --> 00:25:29,954
I would counsel patience, Your Grace.

291
00:25:30,024 --> 00:25:31,549
Patience?

292
00:25:32,024 --> 00:25:34,755
Sansa helped murder my son.
Roose Bolton is a traitor.

293
00:25:34,864 --> 00:25:38,710
Stannis Baratheon is also a traitor,
marching with his army on Winterfell.

294
00:25:39,184 --> 00:25:41,710
Let Stannis and Roose battle.

295
00:25:41,784 --> 00:25:43,627
Let the enemies of the throne
slaughter each other.

296
00:25:43,704 --> 00:25:47,425
And when they're done, seize Winterfell
from whichever thief survives.

297
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:52,066
Winterfell is 1,000 miles away from here.
The weather has already begun to turn.

298
00:25:52,144 --> 00:25:56,593
That is why it is critical to strike soon,
while the victor still licks his wounds.

299
00:25:59,184 --> 00:26:01,471
Surely your Uncle Kevan
could muster a force.

300
00:26:01,544 --> 00:26:04,787
My Uncle Kevan has all the courage
of a kitchen mouse.

301
00:26:04,864 --> 00:26:06,229
Ser Jaime, then.

302
00:26:06,304 --> 00:26:09,148
Jaime's away
on a sensitive diplomatic mission.

303
00:26:09,704 --> 00:26:11,991
I have no idea when he'll be back.

304
00:26:12,064 --> 00:26:13,714
Perhaps I can help.

305
00:26:14,544 --> 00:26:17,946
The Knights of the Vale
are some of the best fighters in Westeros,

306
00:26:18,024 --> 00:26:19,992
trained to battle in the ice and the snow.

307
00:26:20,064 --> 00:26:22,032
Forgive me, Lord Baelish,

308
00:26:23,024 --> 00:26:27,712
you have a reputation as a moneylender
and a brothel keeper, not a military man.

309
00:26:27,784 --> 00:26:32,267
You wouldn't risk a single Lannister soldier
or a single coin from the royal treasury.

310
00:26:33,104 --> 00:26:34,344
What do you have to lose?

311
00:26:34,944 --> 00:26:36,753
A brothel keeper?

312
00:26:37,104 --> 00:26:38,344
And if you succeed?

313
00:26:38,424 --> 00:26:40,472
Name me Warden of the North.

314
00:26:45,344 --> 00:26:47,392
I'll speak to the king this evening,

315
00:26:48,624 --> 00:26:50,626
have him issue a royal decree.

316
00:26:50,904 --> 00:26:53,669
I'll not rest until the
lion flies over Winterfell.

317
00:26:53,744 --> 00:26:55,951
I'll know you're a man of your word

318
00:26:56,024 --> 00:26:58,868
when I see Sansa Stark's head on a spike.

319
00:26:58,944 --> 00:26:59,991
As I said,

320
00:27:01,104 --> 00:27:02,913
I live to serve.

321
00:27:09,144 --> 00:27:11,590
I'm going to ask him tomorrow.

322
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:14,907
- What if he says no?
- He won't.

323
00:27:15,224 --> 00:27:16,828
We've waited long enough.

324
00:27:17,624 --> 00:27:19,865

Or do you...

329

We can't. Not yet.

00:38:23,064 --> 00:38:25,305
And according to the law of the Seven,

487
00:38:25,384 --> 00:38:30,868
neither kings nor queens are exempt
from testimony at a holy inquest.

488
00:38:48,824 --> 00:38:52,271
How do you respond to
these charges against your brother?

489
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:54,234
They are lies.

490
00:38:54,304 --> 00:38:55,669
- All of them?
- All of them.

491
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:57,995
HIGH SPARROW: Queen Margaery,

492
00:38:59,064 --> 00:39:02,591
in the presence of the gods,
do you swear that your brother is innocent

493
00:39:02,664 --> 00:39:05,713
of these charges against him,
to the best of your knowledge?

494
00:39:06,304 --> 00:39:07,749
MARGAERY: Yes, I swear it.

495
00:39:09,944 --> 00:39:12,026
Thank you, Your Grace.

496
00:39:37,424 --> 00:39:38,994
Do you know this man?

497
00:39:39,784 --> 00:39:40,865
Yes.

498
00:39:41,384 --> 00:39:42,715
Very well.

499
00:39:43,064 --> 00:39:45,829
He is Ser Loras Tyrell, heir to Highgarden.

500
00:39:46,144 --> 00:39:47,794
How did you come to meet?

501
00:39:48,584 --> 00:39:50,552
OLYVAR: I squired for him.

502
00:39:50,864 --> 00:39:52,514
He took a liking to me.

503
00:39:52,584 --> 00:39:54,871
He summoned me to his chamber
the first day we met.

504
00:39:57,144 --> 00:40:00,148
And what occurred in his chamber?

505
00:40:00,224 --> 00:40:04,707
We engaged in intimate relations.

506
00:40:05,544 --> 00:40:07,069
You lay with him?

507
00:40:07,144 --> 00:40:08,430
That night and many others.

508
00:40:08,504 --> 00:40:10,905
Liar. He's a liar.

509
00:40:12,184 --> 00:40:14,312
Is there anyone else
who can support your claim?

510
00:40:15,224 --> 00:40:16,714
Yes.

511
00:40:17,064 --> 00:40:18,395
Yes, Queen Margaery.

512
00:40:19,904 --> 00:40:23,033
She walked in on us once, not long ago.

513
00:40:23,344 --> 00:40:25,108
She didn't seem surprised.

514
00:40:26,064 --> 00:40:28,954
This testimony is an
insult to a great house.

515
00:40:29,704 --> 00:40:31,069
Why should the Faith or anyone else

516
00:40:31,144 --> 00:40:34,353
take the word of a squire
over the heir to Highgarden?

517
00:40:34,424 --> 00:40:36,552
OLYVAR: He has a birthmark, Your Grace.

518
00:40:36,984 --> 00:40:39,066
Quite high on his thigh.

519
00:40:39,744 --> 00:40:42,588
Wine-colored
and roughly the shape of Dorne.

520
00:40:43,104 --> 00:40:44,549

The Faith is satisfied
there is enough evidence

524
00:40:53,544 --> 00:40:55,308
to bring a formal trial

525
00:40:55,864 --> 00:40:57,514
for Ser Loras

526
00:40:58,104 --> 00:40:59,435
and Queen Margaery.

527
00:40:59,504 --> 00:41:00,835
What?

528
00:41:01,104 --> 00:41:05,473
Bearing false witness before the gods
is as grave a sin as any, my lady.

529
00:41:05,904 --> 00:41:06,951
Take her.

530
00:41:07,304 --> 00:41:08,749
MARGAERYI No.

531
00:41:09,104 --> 00:41:10,185
Tommen.

532
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:11,431
Tommen!

533
00:41:12,984 --> 00:41:15,191
You can't do this. I am the queen.

534
00:41:15,624 --> 00:41:17,865
Tommen! Tommen!

535
00:41:18,944 --> 00:41:21,948
I am your queen. How dare you?
Take your hands off me!

Lord Ramsay sent me
to draw your bath, my lady.

541
00:41:54,104 --> 00:41:57,995
You want to be clean and fresh
for your new husband, don't you?

542
00:42:14,704 --> 00:42:16,388
You're so beautiful,

but you need to keep him happy.

Well, like the others.

547
00:42:32,064 --> 00:42:33,554
What others?

548
00:42:33,784 --> 00:42:35,024
I shouldn't gossip.

549
00:42:35,984 --> 00:42:37,554
Oh, it's good to see the red again.

550

What others?

552
00:42:41,944 --> 00:42:46,745
Let's see, there was Kyra,
the blacksmith's daughter.

553
00:42:46,824 --> 00:42:49,350
She was tall like you, lovely figure.

554
00:42:49,424 --> 00:42:53,873
But she talked and talked and talked,

555
00:42:55,184 --> 00:42:57,152
and Ramsay grew tired of that.

556
00:42:57,744 --> 00:42:59,473
Then there was Violet.

557
00:42:59,544 --> 00:43:02,195
She had gorgeous blonde hair.

558
00:43:02,264 --> 00:43:05,154
But she got pregnant.

559
00:43:05,264 --> 00:43:08,074
And, well, that was boring.

560
00:43:09,224 --> 00:43:11,830
Then Tansy.

561
00:43:11,904 --> 00:43:13,713
Such a sweet girl.

562
00:43:13,784 --> 00:43:18,745
Of course, sweet girls get a bit dull

563
00:43:18,824 --> 00:43:20,792
after a while, don't they?

564
00:43:21,064 --> 00:43:23,271
Ramsay let me come with him on that hunt.

565
00:43:23,424 --> 00:43:24,550
Hunt?

566
00:43:24,784 --> 00:43:25,785
Mmm.

567
00:43:28,104 --> 00:43:31,950

after the dogs have been at it?

Not so pretty.

569
00:43:36,904 --> 00:43:39,271
But, well, it's your wedding day.

570
00:43:39,984 --> 00:43:42,385
Why am I talking about such things?

571
00:43:44,784 --> 00:43:46,354
What was your name again?

572
00:43:46,424 --> 00:43:47,949
Myranda.

573
00:43:50,104 --> 00:43:52,948
And how long have you loved him, Myranda?

574

be with you forever, is that it?

No.

Lord Ramsay, he said I'm to take your arm.

586
00:45:16,944 --> 00:45:18,230
I'm not touching you.
