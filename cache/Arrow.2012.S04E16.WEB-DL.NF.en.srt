gonna cancel that?

for the defendant?

519
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:43,046
QUENTIN: He wanted me to give him

520
00:23:43,129 --> 00:23:45,841
access to the SCPD computer network.

521
00:23:46,382 --> 00:23:47,634
I did it.

522
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:51,888
He wanted me to give him
the departmental patrol schedules.

523

I did that.

524
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:57,769
He wanted me to break
into a federal server farm

525
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:00,438
to install a computer virus
and I did that.

on the city's leadership and I...

I did that.

And three days later,
the city leadership were all dead.

529
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:14,745
You did all of these things
for the defendant?

he told me that if I didn't do

You saw all those people outside, right?

662
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:07,490
They're out there because love is real,

663

because love is life itself.

664

And if I die tonight,

665

it'll be okay,

The standard of proof

for a preliminary hearing
is much less severe

716
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:32,070
than one for a trial. Even so,

717
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:34,447
the evidence against the defendant
is exceedingly thin.

718
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:38,033
There is no forensic
or circumstantial evidence

719
00:34:38,118 --> 00:34:39,494
that points to the defendant's guilt.

720
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:47,377
But I found Quentin Lance's testimony
to be particularly compelling.

721
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:50,921
His credibility is bolstered
by his status as a police captain,

722
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,633
but the fact that he was willing
to incriminate himself

723
00:34:53,716 --> 00:34:56,594
to see justice done makes his testimony

724

especially believable.

You know, five months ago,

800
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:35,187
I convinced you that we could have it all.

801
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:38,399
We could come here to this job
and have each other,

802
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:39,692
I was wrong.

803
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,946
And then I thought we could just go back
to the way things were,

804
00:38:44,029 --> 00:38:46,240
before we left for Ivy Town.

805
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:49,201
But God, that was as crazy as Cupid is.

806
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:53,664
So what does that mean?

807
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,251
It means that it is, um...

808
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,336

809
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,505
-too hard to be here with you
-(WHIRRS)

810
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,172
every night and not be with you.

811
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:03,341
That's not fair to either of us.

812
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:07,803
You told me how you worked
some tech magic to return all the money

813
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:09,680
that Adam Hunt swindled out of people.

814
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,974
You, you don't need me. You'll be fine.

815
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:18,898
You don't give up.

816
00:39:19,189 --> 00:39:21,776
You know, that's what makes you a hero.

817
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:25,613
But there's no fixing this.

818
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:29,534
We have to let each other go.

819
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:39,877
I want you to keep it
for good this time, please.

820
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,842
I don't wanna let you go.

821
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,721
I don't wanna let you go.

822
00:39:52,222 --> 00:39:54,058
But I'm already gone.

823
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:12,410
