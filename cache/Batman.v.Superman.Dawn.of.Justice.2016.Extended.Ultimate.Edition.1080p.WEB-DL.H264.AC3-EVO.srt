2
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,180
There was a time above.

3
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,850
A time before.

4
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,820
There were perfect things, 

5
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,120
diamond absolutes.

6
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:31,530
How things fall.

7
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:34,030
Things on earth.

8
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:36,060
And what falls...

9
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,160
Master Wayne!

10
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,000
...is fallen. Bruce!

11
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,440
Bruce, it's all right.

12
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,370
Bruce, please.

13
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,750
Martha.

14
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,650
In the dream, they
took me to the light.

15
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:49,550
A beautiful lie.

16
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,160
Jack. Bruce.

17
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,930
Jack, listen to me.

18
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:40,600
I want you to get everyone
out of the building right now.

19
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,440
You understand? Oh, my God.

20
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,140
Stay away from the windows!

21
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,270
Let's go. Come on. Start
moving now, people. Let's go.

22
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,380
The boss wants us out of the
building, so let's make it happen.

23
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,580
Jack. Jack!

24
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,980
We're sorry.

25
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:37,450
All circuits are busy now. Will
you please try your call again later?

26
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,350
Heavenly God,

27
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:44,320
creator of heaven and earth,

28
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,030
have mercy on my soul.

29
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,700
Jack!

30
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,970
Buddy hands! Everybody
show me! Good job!

31
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,710
Come on, guys.

32
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,580
Hold on tight.

33
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:40,010
Come on, guys.

34
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,620
Go.

35
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,850
Mr. Wayne!

36
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:47,350
Mr. Wayne! I can't feel my legs.

37
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,790
I can't feel my legs.

38
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:51,020
We need help over here!

39
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,490
Help me. I can't feel my legs.

40
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,000
You're gonna be
okay. You hear me?

41
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,400
Wallace? What do they
call you, Wally? Huh?

42
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,630
You're the boss, boss.

43
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,470
All right. You're gonna be okay.

44
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,010
Easy, easy. Come on.

45
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,410
Oh, my God. I can't move my leg.

46
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:13,750
My God. I can't feel my legs.

47
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,990
It's okay. You're gonna be okay.

48
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:27,390
You're okay. All right? Huh?

49
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,000
You know what? We're
gonna find your Mom.

50
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,630
Where is she?

51
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,190
All that wind is bad luck.

52
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:37,220
Blood in the sky.

53
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,760
Oh, there she is!

54
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:48,230
Miss Lane.

55
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,710
Miss Lane. Jimmy Olsen.

56
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,870
Photographer. Obviously.

57
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,310
Where's Heron?

58
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:57,110
Uh, trouble at the border.

59
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,380
So, uh, how'd you land it?
This is, like, pioneer stuff.

60
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,720
Amajagh's never
given an interview.

61
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,790
You know what heron always says
when we're on assignment together?

62
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:10,660
Not a goddamn thing.

63
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,790
I like Heron.

64
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,740
Let's go.

65
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,520
Passports. Electronics.
Phones. Camera.

66
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,090
Your fixer said that the
General approved photos.

67
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,110
Um...

68
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:10,920
Are you a terrorist, General?

69
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,750
They did not tell me the
interview was with a lady.

70
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,060
I'm not a lady.
I'm a journalist.

71
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:22,100
What I am is a man with nothing

72
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:25,800
except a love of my people.

73
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,800
Who's paying for these
security contractors, General?

74
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,700
Who pays for the drones that
pass over our heads at night?

75
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,110
One question begs another.

76
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,780
Yes?

77
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:37,610
Say what you're saying, General.

78
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:39,910
It's just a camera.

79
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,820
The United States has declared its
neutrality in your country's civil war

80
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,790
both in policy and in principle.

81
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:48,560
Oh, don't open...
You just exposed...

82
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:53,160
These pious American fictions...

83
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,830
...spoken like truth.

84
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,900
Okay. That's my film.

85
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,110
Men with power obey neither
policy nor principle, Miss Lane.

86
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:10,510
No one is different.

87
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,610
No one is neutral.

88
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,460
CIA.

89
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,530
They're tracking us!

90
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:29,430
You!

91
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:34,870
You're CIA?

92
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,400
What? No. No!

93
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,540
You brought him here!
No, he's a photographer.

94
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:41,880
No!

95
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,250
It's okay, Lois.

96
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,530
Talon's down, sir.

97
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,740
Python, we have lost
our asset on the ground.

98
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,910
Repeat, we have lost
our asset on the ground.

99
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:14,910
There's still a civilian in the
compound. We'll extract her.

100
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:17,840
Negative. RPA to engage.
Stand down and get black.

101
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:21,180
There'll be friendlies
in the blast zone, so...

102
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,380
Call off the goddamn drone.

103
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:26,020
Stand down is an order. Python?

104
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,650
Let's move!

105
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,530
I...

106
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:38,970
I didn't know.

107
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:43,940
Ignorance is not the
same as innocence,

108
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,310
Miss Lane.

109
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,540
Get up! Stand up!

110
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,820
Quickly. He's coming.

111
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,660
Inbound 2 Mikes.

112
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,170
Passing python now.

113
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,410
Move out!

114
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:06,520
Target locked. You
are clear to engage.

115
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,220
Armed hot and in range.

116
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:14,960
Three.

117
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,900
Two. One.

118
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,040
Link's been hit.

119
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,610
By what?

120
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:38,580
Take one step,

121
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,490
you will see the
inside of her head.

122
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:07,010
The women in the
village heard a noise.

123
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:12,610
Like the sky cracked open.

124
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:17,320
He came down. Then came fire.

125
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:21,650
Even worse came after.

126
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,990
The Government attacked.

127
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:26,830
No mercy in the villages.

128
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:29,400
My parents tried to run.

129
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:37,200
The world has been so caught
up with what Superman can do

130
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:40,670
that no one has asked
what he should do.

131
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:45,980
Let the record show that this
committee holds him responsible.

132
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:48,150
He'll never answer to you.

133
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:50,820
He answers to no one.

134
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:53,290
Not even, I think, to God.

135
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,490
58 to nothing.

136
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:59,690
Metropolis, again,
blowing out Gotham city.

137
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:02,160
Really, only the diehards
are left in the stands.

138
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,360
Delta Charlie 27. Reports of
screams coming from vacant home

139
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,300
at 1939 Harborway.

140
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,830
Tom, it's been great
working with you.

141
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,140
I want to thank our
producer and director.

142
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,670
Now wait a second. I
don't even want to suggest...

143
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:12,540
Delta Charlie 27, respond.

144
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,840
Just take a knee.

145
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,910
They're lining up as if clarkson
is gonna throw it deep here.

146
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:19,150
- Don't tell me, Dave.
- Going to the end zone!

147
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:21,350
- This is unnecessary.
- Delta Charlie 27.

148
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,180
- Zeke Baker is open.
- Baker with a touchdown catch!

149
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,850
I can't believe I
just watched that.

150
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:26,420
Delta Charlie 27. Do you copy?

151
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:28,750
10-4. We're on it.

152
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,990
And now a fight breaks out.

153
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:34,230
Gotham city, you know how
they are about their football team.

154
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:37,200
Things could get
ugly in the city tonight.

155
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,610
Go.

156
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,650
It's okay.

157
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,250
It's okay.

158
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:38,060
We're gonna help.
We're here to help.

159
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:40,490
We're gonna get you
out of here. Okay?

160
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,040
I don't understand.

161
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,680
Please don't. Please don't.

162
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:10,520
Please. I don't know who he is.

163
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,030
I don't know who he is!

164
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,870
No!

165
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:41,250
Oh, fuck.

166
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:22,530
Christ!

167
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:24,100
I saw him.

168
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,900
I never saw him
before. I... I didn't know.

169
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,700
You almost took my face off.

170
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,140
How about you don't
shoot the good guys, huh?

171
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:33,370
Oh. Oh.

172
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,670
Jesus Christ.

173
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,280
He branded him.

174
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:09,170
Hey. Hey.

175
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:10,440
I was gonna cook.

176
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,070
Surprise you.

177
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,580
They held hearings
about what happened.

178
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:22,310
They're saying
that... I don't care.

179
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,720
I don't care what
they're saying.

180
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:28,290
The woman I love could
have been blown up or shot.

181
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:29,990
Think of what could
have happened.

182
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:32,460
Well, think about
what did happen.

183
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,860
I didn't kill those men,
if that's what they think.

184
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,630
If that's what you're saying.

185
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:39,060
No, I'm saying I want to
understand what happened.

186
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,800
I'm saying thank
you for saving my life.

187
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,600
I'm saying there's a cost.

188
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,550
I just don't know
if it's possible.

189
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,450
Don't know if what's possible?

190
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:03,760
For you to love me and be you.

191
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:32,750
Clark!

192
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:36,360
Clark, you're going
to flood the apartment.

193
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,520
Mmm-hmm.

194
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:13,560
You still working?

195
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,960
You're getting slow
in your old age, Alfred.

196
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,330
Comes to us all, Master Wayne.

197
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:22,030
Even you got too
old to die young.

198
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:25,870
And not for lack of trying.

199
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:30,280
Funnel-ferry butterbar.
Funnel-ferry butterbar.

200
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,310
Funnel-ferry butterbar.
Funnel-ferry...

201
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:34,480
There's nothing wrong
with the microphone.

202
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,620
It's this new layer of armor.

203
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,550
I'll just have to rewire.

204
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:45,990
So, last night was productive?

205
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:49,930
No. He's too low-level.
He knew nothing.

206
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:52,360
This is the man
who knows things.

207
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:56,270
Anatoli Knyazev. He's Russian.

208
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:57,800
Contracts all over the globe,

209
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:59,170
but he's based out
of the port of Gotham.

210
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:00,970
Weapons and human trafficking.

211
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,840
So the white
Portuguese is a Russian.

212
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,980
That's the theory.

213
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:09,620
No. The theory is that the Russian
will lead me to the man himself.

214
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:13,620
If he is, indeed, a "him."

215
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,020
You don't even
know if he exists.

216
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,560
Could be a Phantasm.

217
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,790
One that wants to bring
a dirty bomb into Gotham?

218
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,590
Ah, high-stakes round.

219
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:26,570
New rules.

220
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,170
We're criminals, Alfred.

221
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:33,710
We've always been
criminals. Nothing's changed.

222
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:36,880
Oh, yes, it has, sir.

223
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,110
Everything's changed.

224
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:46,790
Men fall from the sky.

225
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:50,390
The Gods hurl thunderbolts.

226
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,130
Innocents die.

227
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:57,030
That's how it starts, sir.

228
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:59,200
The fever. The rage.

229
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,130
The feeling of powerlessness.

230
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:08,140
It turns good men cruel.

231
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:22,090
John, get D.

232
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:24,860
Ooh. Ah. Ahoy, ahoy! I
did not know you were here.

233
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,930
Man on the Marquee.
Yeah, don't believe it.

234
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:28,560
My father named the
company after himself.

235
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,760
He was the Lex in front of
the Corp. How you doin'?

236
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:32,360
Oh, really great.

237
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:34,930
Really great? Good.
Good. Uh, follow me.

238
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,640
No, uh, Dad started saying
that he named the company,

239
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,440
uh, after his kid
at investor pitches.

240
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,740
Rich old ladies. They thought
it was very cute, you know?

241
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,610
"Write check for Lex."

242
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:46,780
You know, Dad was
born in East Germany.

243
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:49,110
He grew up eating,
uh, stale crackers.

244
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,320
And every other Saturday,
he had to march in a parade

245
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,390
and wave flowers at Tyrants.

246
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:57,120
So, I think it was
Providence that his son, me,

247
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,720
would end up with this.

248
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:01,330
One of my rebuild
Metropolis crews found it.

249
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:03,930
Little souvenir from the
Kryptonian world engine.

250
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:05,760
What does a rock have to
do with homeland security?

251
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,770
Homeland security? Hmm.

252
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:11,470
No, no, no, ma'am,
planetary security.

253
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:13,510
The fragment is of a
radioactive xenomineral.

254
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:16,310
We suspected it might
have bio-interactions, 

255
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:19,310
so we took the sample to amriid,

256
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:22,450
where they keep the remains
of the Kryptonian decedent.

257
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:25,950
And, when we exposed
General Zod to the mineral,

258
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:28,150
this happened.

259
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:32,620
Profound biodegradation.
Decaying Kryptonian cells.

260
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:34,160
We concluded the mineral
could be weaponized

261
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,690
if a large enough
sample was found.

262
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:39,330
And then, among
the fishes, a whale.

263
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:40,830
Ah!

264
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,340
Lying at the bottom
of the Indian ocean.

265
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,500
Emerald city.

266
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,440
Beautiful.

267
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,010
Now, rocky is radioactive, 

268
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:52,110
but what he needs from
you is an import license.

269
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:54,850
And why would we want
to weaponize this material?

270
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:56,010
As a deterrent.

271
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,520
A silver bullet to
keep in reserve,

272
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,780
to use against the Kryptonians,

273
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,690
so the day does not come, Madam,

274
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:02,490
when your children are waving
daisies at a reviewing stand.

275
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:04,190
Last I looked, the
only one of those

276
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:05,820
flying around up
here was Superman.

277
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:09,030
Ha-ha, yes. Superman.
Yeah, but there are, uh...

278
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:10,460
There are more of them.

279
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,830
The metahuman thesis.

280
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,230
Yes, the metahuman thesis.

281
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:14,630
More likely than not

282
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,740
these exceptional
beings live among us.

283
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:19,540
The basis of our myths.
Gods among men upon

284
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,040
our little blue planet here.

285
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,180
Now, you don't have
to use a silver bullet.

286
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:27,710
But if you forge one...

287
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,410
Well, then

288
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:32,080
we don't have to depend
upon the kindness of monsters.

289
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,830
There are ways we
can help each other.

290
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:42,060
Would you step
into my office here?

291
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,700
Yes.

292
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,470
What's your wish list?

293
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:53,610
Uh...

294
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:56,110
Access to the wreck of the
crashed Kryptonian ship?

295
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,440
Done.

296
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:51,260
The complete remains of
the dead alien for testing.

297
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:54,200
You want Zod's body?

298
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:56,870
Okay.

299
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,650
Mmm.

300
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:34,240
It's cherry.

301
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,410
Mmm-mmm.

302
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:42,150
Because the time has come

303
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:45,450
for the world to hear
the other side of the story.

304
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:48,690
They say that Superman is a
hero. Okay, but whose hero?

305
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:50,990
If Superman were here right now, 

306
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:53,130
what would you
want to say to him?

307
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:55,530
That my family, too, had dreams.

308
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,360
To look him in his eye

309
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:02,470
and ask him how he decides...

310
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:03,870
...which lives count.

311
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,410
And which ones do not.

312
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,010
Sir, get down.

313
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:21,980
Sir, I said get down!

314
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:25,450
Now!

315
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:27,020
Can we get some backup here?

316
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:29,920
Hey! Hey! Don't do it!

317
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,120
Hey!

318
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:36,060
Lois! Crime lab, on three.

319
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,260
- This is Lane.
- Kent.

320
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:40,900
You're sports today.

321
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:43,100
I want you to go to
Gotham, follow up on football.

322
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:47,910
"Underdog dreams dashed: Ten
yards between Gotham and glory."

323
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:50,280
Oh, um, watch yourself
over there in Gotham.

324
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,720
Don't let them take
your lunch money.

325
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:54,810
Hey. Are you guys watching this?

326
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,620
Emergency responders
quickly created

327
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,980
a precautionary perimeter
around heroes park

328
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,690
while they brought the man
down from this beloved monument.

329
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:05,160
The suspect has been identified
as Wallace Vernon Keefe.

330
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,420
I work for Bruce Wayne!

331
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:08,190
I work for Bruce Wayne!

332
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,600
He'll be arraigned on
charges of vandalism, 

333
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,130
resisting arrest, 

334
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:14,270
and the felony charge
of making terrorist threats.

335
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:16,330
That carries up to
40 years in prison.

336
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,540
Poor son of a bitch.

337
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:19,640
Metropolis News 8.

338
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,270
Jenny. Hmm.

339
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,480
Headline: "End of love
affair with man in the sky,

340
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,040
"question mark (?)." 

341
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:28,280
Okay.

342
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:10,920
Is she in?

343
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,590
No, she's been gone.

344
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:15,890
What'd she do, officer?

345
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,100
Oh, I'm not a cop.

346
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,430
I'm a reporter.

347
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:23,240
The young lady living here...

348
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,170
She hasn't been back.

349
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:26,910
In fact, if she's smart, then
she's got out of this city.

350
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:30,010
And you need to get
out of here before dark.

351
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:31,510
Unless you want to run into him.

352
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:33,280
Don't listen to that nonsense.

353
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,920
Only people scared of him,
people who got reason to be.

354
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,750
Scared of who?

355
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:41,120
There's a new
kind of mean in him.

356
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,520
He is angry.

357
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,520
And he's hunting.

358
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,930
Show 'em what you got!

359
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:53,770
Let's go. Come on!

360
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,340
Throw a punch, will ya?

361
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:02,140
Let's go! Come on!

362
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:26,530
Thank you.

363
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,810
The house treats
luck like an insult.

364
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:40,650
Good luck for one is always
his brother's misfortune.

365
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,820
Three nights with
a Bolshoi Ballerina,

366
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,590
that line was all she taught me.

367
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:51,590
Not all, I'm sure. Good evening.

368
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:59,000
It's like a one-man
reign of terror.

369
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,830
This Bat vigilante has been
consistently targeting the port

370
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,840
and the adjacent
projects and tenements.

371
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,840
And, as far as I can tell, the
cops are actually helping him.

372
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,810
"Crime wave in Gotham."

373
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:13,010
Other breaking
news: "Water, wet."

374
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:14,610
Did you file the football yet?

375
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:16,510
Why aren't we covering this?

376
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,520
Poor people don't buy papers?

377
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,650
People don't buy
papers, period, Kent.

378
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,050
Perry, when you assign a story,

379
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,820
you're making a choice
about who matters.

380
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,190
And who's worth it.

381
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:26,990
Good morning, Smallville.

382
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:30,660
The American conscience died
with Robert, Martin, and John.

383
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:33,830
Sorry. I'm sorry.

384
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:36,940
No match. My guys in the
crime lab never seen one before.

385
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,410
It's called a bullet. You
shoot people with them.

386
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:41,910
Recovered from the scene

387
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:43,580
of the firefight in the desert.

388
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,880
Not sold anywhere
commercially in the world,

389
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,080
even black market.

390
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,480
So?

391
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,380
So who gave
prototype military rounds

392
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,850
to Tuareg fighters
in the Sahara?

393
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:53,490
You're the reporter. Tell me.

394
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:55,250
I think that the us government
is arming the rebels

395
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,890
while claiming to support
the elected government.

396
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:58,560
The ask, Lois.

397
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:05,490
Flight to D.C. tonight.
Couple of days there.

398
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:06,830
Go.

399
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:09,170
Coach. No extra legroom.

400
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,000
Economy plus.

401
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:14,270
Coach!

402
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,910
So, why didn't you tell me?

403
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:22,180
You're digging up snakes, Lo.

404
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:25,180
It's kind of dangerous.

405
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:27,120
That is why I didn't tell you.

406
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,600
Lane, don't you
have a plane to catch?

407
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:30,660
Yes, sir.

408
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:34,730
Benefit for the
library of Metropolis.

409
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:37,760
Someone on the committee
requested that Clark Kent cover it.

410
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,000
Probably some old charity
crone who's got a thing for nerds.

411
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,780
Senator.

412
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:55,450
Little bourbon before lunch?

413
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:57,580
My driver's
outside. I can't stay.

414
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,450
No bourbon?

415
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:00,950
Kentucky girl like yourself?

416
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:03,460
Hmm.

417
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:06,320
My Dad always said
that Kentucky mash

418
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:08,290
was the secret to health.

419
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,960
Mmm.

420
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,400
This was his room.

421
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:16,170
I kept it just the same.

422
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,470
Mmm.

423
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:25,810
"Maybe one day Dad'll come back
if I just keep everything the same."

424
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:27,380
That is silly.

425
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:31,480
The magical thinking
of orphan boys.

426
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:34,220
I'm blocking the import
license for your mineral.

427
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:43,930
The redcapes are coming.

428
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:47,600
The redcapes are coming.

429
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,670
Hmm...

430
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:53,200
You and your hearings.

431
00:41:57,210 --> 00:41:59,740
Galloping through
the streets to warn us.

432
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,880
One if by land,

433
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,880
two if by air.

434
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:06,250
Mmm.

435
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:14,030
Do you know the oldest
lie in America, Senator?

436
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:15,230
Can I call you June?

437
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:18,030
You can call me
whatever you like.

438
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:20,730
Take a bucket of piss and
call it granny's peach tea.

439
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:22,300
Mmm-hmm.

440
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,740
Take a weapon of assassination

441
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:25,440
and call it deterrence.

442
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:29,210
You won't fool a fly or me.

443
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:32,780
I'm not gonna drink it.

444
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,820
You don't think Dad
would mind, do you?

445
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:44,760
If I changed just... Just
one thing in this room?

446
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:49,590
Because that should
be upside-down.

447
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:53,830
We know better now, don't we?

448
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:56,970
The Devils don't come
from Hell beneath us. No.

449
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,100
No, they come from the sky.

450
00:44:56,390 --> 00:44:57,720
Oh.

451
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,560
I hope the next
generation of Waynes

452
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:03,460
won't inherit an
empty wine cellar.

453
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:06,600
Not that there's likely
to be a next generation.

454
00:45:07,870 --> 00:45:09,130
Thank you, sir.

455
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:15,740
This is every call made
from the Russian's phone.

456
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:18,210
Two mentions of business
with the white Portuguese.

457
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:21,150
And it's continually
transmitting blacked-out data

458
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:22,810
to the personal residence

459
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:24,480
of Alexander Luthor.

460
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:28,350
You think Lex Luthor
is the white Portuguese?

461
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:32,360
I can't see that he needs the
income from imported arms.

462
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:34,390
Regardless, I'll need to
put a leech at his house,

463
00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:35,730
and I'm gonna need the suit.

464
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:37,830
The bat interrogated six people

465
00:45:37,830 --> 00:45:39,830
and came away with nothing.

466
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:43,900
It was Bruce Wayne
that got the information.

467
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:47,070
Well, Bruce Wayne can't
break into Lex Luthor's house.

468
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:48,810
Bruce Wayne won't have to.

469
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:52,080
He's been invited.

470
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:07,490
Who's that?

471
00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:09,920
You must be new to the
"let them eat cake" beat.

472
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,690
That is Bruce Wayne.

473
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:14,930
Philanthropist, bibliophile...

474
00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:18,130
True friend of the
library of Metropolis.

475
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:19,530
Mr. Lex Luthor.

476
00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:22,230
Me? Ah. Okay.

477
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:29,110
Nicky. Uh...

478
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:31,340
You're embarrassing me. Um...

479
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:33,380
Speech, speech. Uh...

480
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:35,010
Blah, blah, blah. Uh...

481
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:37,480
Open bar.

482
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,480
The end.

483
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:42,220
Uh...

484
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:45,220
The word "philanthropist"
comes from the Greek.

485
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:46,820
Meaning a lover of humanity.

486
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:49,890
Uh, it was coined
about 2,500 years ago.

487
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,660
All right. Where
am I going, Alfred?

488
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:53,830
Go past the elevator.

489
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:55,370
Do a left.

490
00:47:56,170 --> 00:47:58,540
That's right, must be.

491
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:00,870
It's in the service
corridor in the basement.

492
00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:02,340
Go down the stairs.

493
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:04,640
Gods and men.
Prometheus went with us.

494
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,380
And he ruined Zeus'
plan to destroy mankind,

495
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:08,940
and for that he was
given a thunderbolt.

496
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:12,220
Hmm, that seems unfair.

497
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:15,220
Um... on a serious note,
the library of Metropolis...

498
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:17,150
Go to the stairs. You saw them
on your way in. Down the stairs.

499
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:20,890
But at one time, Dad
could not buy them. No.

500
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:23,030
My father could not
afford books growing up.

501
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:25,510
He had to root through the
garbage for yesterday's newspaper.

502
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,800
All right. You got the
kitchens on your right.

503
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:31,540
Do a left.

504
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:33,770
Right in front of you.
That's where you want to be.

505
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:51,920
May I help you, Mr. Wayne?

506
00:48:51,930 --> 00:48:54,290
Uh, I just...

507
00:48:54,290 --> 00:48:57,060
I thought the bathroom
was down here. I must have...

508
00:48:57,060 --> 00:49:00,770
That last martini was
two too many, I think.

509
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:02,230
Men's room is upstairs.

510
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:03,830
Great. I'm okay.

511
00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:06,000
I like those shoes.

512
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,780
I can't stay down here, Alfred.

513
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:14,250
Go upstairs and socialize.

514
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:15,950
Some young lady from Metropolis

515
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:17,280
will make you honest.

516
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:21,320
In your dreams, Alfred.

517
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:22,820
Books are knowledge, 

518
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:26,390
and knowledge is
power, and I am...

519
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:27,990
No. Uh, um...

520
00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:31,000
No. What am I? I...
What was I saying? No.

521
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:34,730
The bittersweet pain among men

522
00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:38,600
is having knowledge
with no power, because...

523
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,540
Because that is
paradoxical! And, um...

524
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:45,980
Thank you for coming.

525
00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:49,010
Please drink. Drink.

526
00:49:57,860 --> 00:50:02,160
Mr. Wayne? Mr. Wayne?
Clark Kent, Daily Planet.

527
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,260
Uh, my foundation has
already issued a statement

528
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:06,330
in support of books.

529
00:50:06,330 --> 00:50:08,500
Sir? Um...

530
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:11,200
Wow. Pretty girl. Bad
habit. Don't quote me.

531
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,870
All right?

532
00:50:12,870 --> 00:50:15,840
What's your position on
the Bat vigilante in Gotham?

533
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:18,540
Daily Planet. Do I own this
one? Or is that the other guy?

534
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:22,150
Civil liberties are being
trampled on in your city.

535
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:23,510
Good people are living in fear.

536
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:28,490
Don't believe
everything you hear, son.

537
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:31,860
I've seen it, Mr. Wayne.
He thinks he's above the law.

538
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:38,230
The Daily Planet criticizing those
who think they're above the law

539
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:42,400
is a little hypocritical,
wouldn't you say?

540
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:45,170
Considering every time your
hero saves a cat out of a tree,

541
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:47,470
you write a puff piece editorial

542
00:50:47,470 --> 00:50:50,210
about an alien
who, if he wanted to,

543
00:50:50,210 --> 00:50:52,980
could burn the whole place down.

544
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:55,810
There wouldn't be a damn
thing we could do to stop him.

545
00:50:57,850 --> 00:51:00,890
Most of the world doesn't
share your opinion, Mr. Wayne.

546
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:04,360
Maybe it's the
Gotham city in me.

547
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:05,820
We just have a bad history

548
00:51:05,830 --> 00:51:07,590
with freaks dressed like clowns.

549
00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:11,100
Boys! Um!

550
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:13,700
Bruce Wayne
meets Clark Kent. Ha!

551
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:15,700
I love it. I love bringing
people together.

552
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:16,730
How are we?

553
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,500
Lex. Hello. Good.

554
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:21,010
Hi, hello, Lex, it
is a pleasure. Ow!

555
00:51:21,010 --> 00:51:22,610
Wow! That is a good grip!

556
00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:25,410
You should not pick a
fight with this person. Huh.

557
00:51:25,410 --> 00:51:27,710
So, after all these years, we
finally got you over to Metropolis.

558
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:29,880
Well, I thought I'd
come drink you dry.

559
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,880
Well, you're welcome. You should
hop the Harbor more often, though.

560
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,220
I'd love to show you my labs.

561
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:35,690
Maybe we could
partner on something.

562
00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:38,590
My R and D is up to
all sorts of no good.

563
00:51:42,590 --> 00:51:43,960
That's seven minutes.

564
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:45,400
Looks like the
transfer's complete.

565
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:47,770
Mr. Luthor. Yes?

566
00:51:47,770 --> 00:51:49,600
The Governor. Governor.

567
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,100
Excuse me. Next time.

568
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:52,440
Governor! Hi!

569
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,140
Lex, it's good to see you.

570
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:33,480
Excuse me.

571
00:53:39,710 --> 00:53:42,210
We, as a population
on this planet, 

572
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:43,710
have been looking for a savior.

573
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,150
90% of people believe
in a higher power, 

574
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:47,590
and every religion believes

575
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:49,550
in some sort of
messianic figure.

576
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:52,720
And when this savior character
actually comes to earth, 

577
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:55,060
we want to make him
abide by our rules?

578
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:57,190
We have to understand
that this a paradigm shift.

579
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,730
We have to start
thinking beyond politics.

580
00:53:59,730 --> 00:54:02,400
Are there any moral
constraints on this person?

581
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,400
We have international law.

582
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:07,570
On this earth, every
act is a political act.

583
00:54:07,570 --> 00:54:09,410
Is it really surprising

584
00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:11,780
that the most powerful
man in the world

585
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:14,950
should be a figure
of controversy?

586
00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:17,510
Uh, to have an
individual engaging

587
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,920
in these state-level
interventions

588
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:22,050
should give us all pause.

589
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:24,290
Human beings have
a horrible track record

590
00:54:24,290 --> 00:54:26,560
of following people
with great power

591
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:28,260
down paths that led to

592
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:30,260
huge human atrocities.

593
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:32,800
We have always created
icons in our own image.

594
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:36,270
What we've done is we
project ourselves onto him.

595
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:39,970
The fact is, maybe he's not some
sort of Devil or Jesus character.

596
00:54:39,970 --> 00:54:42,440
Maybe he's just a guy
trying to do the right thing.

597
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:45,610
Neil deGrasse Tyson: We're talking
about a being whose very existence

598
00:54:45,610 --> 00:54:50,150
challenges our own sense
of priority in the universe.

599
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:51,620
And you go back to copernicus, 

600
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:53,120
where he restored the sun

601
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:54,620
in the center of
the known universe, 

602
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:56,120
displacing earth.

603
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:57,960
And you get to
darwinian evolution, 

604
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:00,120
and you find out we're
not special on this earth, 

605
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,960
we're just one
among other lifeforms.

606
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:04,830
And now we learn
that we're not even

607
00:55:04,830 --> 00:55:06,300
special in the entire universe

608
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:09,170
because there is Superman.

609
00:55:09,170 --> 00:55:12,840
There he is. An alien among us.

610
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:14,940
We're not alone.

611
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:17,140
Are you, as a United
States Senator, 

612
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:21,580
personally comfortable
saying to a grieving parent, 

613
00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:25,150
"Superman could
have saved your child, 

614
00:55:25,150 --> 00:55:29,350
"but on principle, we
did not want him to act"?

615
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:31,320
I'm not saying he shouldn't act.

616
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,260
I'm saying he
shouldn't act unilaterally.

617
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:35,490
What are we talking
about here, then?

618
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:38,200
Must there be a Superman?

619
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:41,570
There is.

620
00:55:54,550 --> 00:55:55,650
Hello?

621
00:55:55,650 --> 00:55:57,010
Mom?

622
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,250
Clark!

623
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:00,650
What is it?

624
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:01,890
What's wrong?

625
00:56:01,890 --> 00:56:04,120
No. Nothing. I just...

626
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:08,290
Hi.

627
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:11,760
Hi.

628
00:56:14,230 --> 00:56:16,100
How come Dad never left Kansas?

629
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:22,040
Well, he just...

630
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:24,540
You know how he was.

631
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:26,540
"What do I need to travel for?

632
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:28,110
"I'm already there."

633
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,120
Just wish it was more simple.

634
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:36,220
My baby boy.

635
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:40,460
Nothing was ever simple.

636
00:56:47,830 --> 00:56:49,430
An odd little duck.

637
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:52,900
Hmm!

638
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:54,300
I've never seen
a metal like this.

639
00:56:56,210 --> 00:56:59,210
Could be Darpa Black Box.

640
00:56:59,210 --> 00:57:00,880
Who could find out?

641
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,850
Nobody who'd want to.

642
00:57:02,850 --> 00:57:05,720
Maybe they gave them out
to the rebels to test in theater.

643
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:08,920
Using live soldiers
as Guinea pigs?

644
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:11,790
This is what makes
you such a good reporter.

645
00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:13,090
Stuff like this
still shocks you.

646
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:37,110
It don't come off!

647
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,220
It don't come off!

648
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:41,450
Prisoner transfer!

649
00:57:41,450 --> 00:57:43,720
You can't put me in General,
man. They gonna kill me.

650
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:45,320
Hey, you can't
bring me to General.

651
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:46,620
You should be thanking
the tax payers of Metropolis

652
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:48,390
for taking in your branded ass.

653
00:57:48,390 --> 00:57:49,990
Sign here, please.
I'm marked, man.

654
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,630
You know what they do to
people with this on them?

655
00:57:51,630 --> 00:57:53,160
He's only a criminal.

656
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:54,670
This way! Let's go!
They're gonna kill me!

657
00:57:54,670 --> 00:57:55,970
- They're gonna kill me!
- Let's go!

658
00:57:55,970 --> 00:57:57,070
Keefe.

659
00:57:57,070 --> 00:57:58,800
You made bail.

660
00:57:58,800 --> 00:57:59,870
Open two.

661
00:58:05,610 --> 00:58:06,840
Who paid?

662
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:20,320
Who the hell are you?

663
00:58:25,830 --> 00:58:27,200
Just a man.

664
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:29,400
Yeah? Well, what
the fuck do you want?

665
00:58:34,470 --> 00:58:35,750
To help you stand for something.

666
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:42,610
Your three o'clock's here.

667
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:55,260
He made me half a man.

668
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:58,900
My wife

669
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:01,100
walked out on me.

670
00:59:03,130 --> 00:59:06,270
I can't even piss standing up.

671
00:59:07,370 --> 00:59:08,940
Let me face him.

672
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:12,410
You'll take care of it?

673
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:15,280
Good.

674
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:41,970
What?

675
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:02,430
Wrong room, Miss.

676
01:00:02,430 --> 01:00:03,890
Secretary Swanwick,

677
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:05,540
you haven't been
returning my phone calls.

678
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:09,430
Miss Lane, if you'd
like an interview,

679
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:12,070
Major Farris is just
outside that door.

680
01:00:12,070 --> 01:00:13,970
You're treating
me like a stranger?

681
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:17,440
I'm treating you
like a reporter.

682
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:21,210
All right. Is the us providing
experimental military arms

683
01:00:21,210 --> 01:00:23,050
to rebels in Africa?

684
01:00:23,050 --> 01:00:25,620
You know, with balls like yours,

685
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:27,550
you belong in here.

686
01:00:27,550 --> 01:00:30,750
What's your source
on this? A tin foil hat?

687
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:32,790
No, not tin. But it's metal.

688
01:00:32,790 --> 01:00:34,630
Fired in the Superman incident.

689
01:00:34,630 --> 01:00:37,060
Experts at the
Pentagon can't ID it.

690
01:00:37,060 --> 01:00:38,300
We haven't been told the truth.

691
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:39,600
Here's the truth.

692
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:41,060
A reporter got
greedy for a scoop

693
01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:42,470
and went where
she shouldn't have.

694
01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:44,640
Superman acted like
some rogue combatant

695
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:47,300
to rescue her, and people died.

696
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:50,040
Don't invent a conspiracy
theory to put back his Halo.

697
01:00:51,310 --> 01:00:52,480
Or yours.

698
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:54,980
- Major.
- Sir.

699
01:00:56,180 --> 01:00:57,610
So.

700
01:00:57,620 --> 01:01:00,150
I logged into your
dropbox to find copy.

701
01:01:00,150 --> 01:01:02,520
There's copy all right.

702
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:06,460
But nothing about
football. Nothing about, uh,

703
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:09,760
the friends of the
Metropolis library,

704
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:12,660
just the goddamn
Gotham Bat thing

705
01:01:12,670 --> 01:01:14,700
I told you not to pursue.

706
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:16,700
If the police won't help, the
press has to do the right thing.

707
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:18,600
You don't get to decide
what the right thing is.

708
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:21,000
When the Planet was founded,
it stood for something, Perry.

709
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:24,840
And so could you if it
was 1938, but it's not 1938.

710
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:28,110
WPA ain't hiring no more.
Apples don't cost a nickel.

711
01:01:28,110 --> 01:01:31,110
Not in here, not out
there. You drop this thing!

712
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:36,420
Nobody cares about Clark
Kent taking on the Batman.

713
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:40,460
So apparently Superman

714
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:42,830
doesn't want us to think of
him as American anymore.

715
01:01:42,830 --> 01:01:44,230
And really, why would we?

716
01:01:44,230 --> 01:01:46,160
Aside from the red
and blue costume.

717
01:01:46,170 --> 01:01:47,960
And, I don't know,
the fact that he has

718
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:50,470
one-third of the USA's
initials on his chest.

719
01:01:50,470 --> 01:01:52,070
I assume the only
reason he's not wearing

720
01:01:52,070 --> 01:01:55,040
the declaration of
independence as a cape is...

721
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:56,670
He thinks it's too on-the-nose.

722
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:58,640
What is going on back here? No.

723
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:00,180
Guys, come on. Let's go.

724
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:01,650
Get yourselves together
and get out there.

725
01:02:01,650 --> 01:02:03,050
Get those glasses
on those trays.

726
01:02:03,050 --> 01:02:04,370
We got thirsty people out there.

727
01:02:13,090 --> 01:02:14,890
I wonder, would you excuse us?

728
01:02:14,890 --> 01:02:17,730
There's something I'd
like to show you. I'm sorry.

729
01:02:17,730 --> 01:02:21,030
Now some scholars insist
that it never happened...

730
01:02:21,030 --> 01:02:23,030
But I believe it's the action

731
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:27,900
perfectly in keeping with a king
who was also a psychopathic killer.

732
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:31,680
For me, it's the culmination
of 40 years curating.

733
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:34,680
And I can't believe it,
but I've finally got it here.

734
01:02:35,950 --> 01:02:38,010
It's the sword of Alexander.

735
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:42,320
It's the blade that
cut the Gordian Knot.

736
01:02:44,860 --> 01:02:46,220
It's a Triumph.

737
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:47,690
Yes.

738
01:02:47,690 --> 01:02:49,090
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

739
01:02:56,770 --> 01:02:58,470
It's a fake.

740
01:02:58,470 --> 01:03:01,270
The real one was sold
in '98 on the black market.

741
01:03:01,270 --> 01:03:02,440
And now it hangs...

742
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:04,780
Over the bed of
the Sultan of Hajar.

743
01:03:08,050 --> 01:03:09,680
Excuse me.

744
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,720
Excuse me, Miss.

745
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:15,950
The other night you took
something that doesn't belong to you.

746
01:03:15,950 --> 01:03:18,120
Stealing's not polite.

747
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:20,790
Is it stealing if you
steal from another thief?

748
01:03:22,630 --> 01:03:24,260
Who are you?

749
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:26,830
Someone interested in
the same man you are.

750
01:03:27,830 --> 01:03:29,770
Is that right?

751
01:03:29,770 --> 01:03:32,840
I believe Mr. Luthor has a
photograph that belongs to me.

752
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:34,340
Did you get it?

753
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:36,840
As it happens, no, I didn't.

754
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:39,980
The data you copied has
military-grade encryption.

755
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,510
You know, I bet with that dress,

756
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:46,450
9 out of 10 men will let
you get away with anything.

757
01:03:46,450 --> 01:03:47,950
But you're the 10th?

758
01:03:47,950 --> 01:03:50,350
I'm guessing I'm the first

759
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:52,720
to see through that
babe-in-the-woods act.

760
01:03:53,790 --> 01:03:55,460
You don't know me,

761
01:03:55,460 --> 01:03:57,090
but I've known a
few women like you.

762
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:03,530
Oh, I don't think you've
ever known a woman like me.

763
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:08,310
You know, it's true what
they say about little boys.

764
01:04:08,310 --> 01:04:11,070
Born with no natural
inclination to share.

765
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:14,510
I didn't steal your drive.

766
01:04:14,510 --> 01:04:16,780
I borrowed it.

767
01:04:16,780 --> 01:04:19,750
You'll find it in the glove
compartment of your car.

768
01:04:20,990 --> 01:04:22,090
Mr. Wayne.

769
01:06:15,330 --> 01:06:16,470
Did you get it?

770
01:06:16,470 --> 01:06:17,800
The rock?

771
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:19,140
Yeah, we got it.

772
01:06:44,930 --> 01:06:46,030
I'm sorry.

773
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:50,700
Get down! Get down now!

774
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:07,620
No!

775
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:03,500
She was my world.

776
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:07,040
And you took her from me.

777
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:19,520
Bruce!

778
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:22,590
Bruce! Listen to me now!

779
01:09:25,860 --> 01:09:27,990
It's Lois!

780
01:09:27,990 --> 01:09:29,930
It's Lois Lane!

781
01:09:30,630 --> 01:09:32,200
She's the key!

782
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,600
Am I too soon?

783
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,500
I'm too soon!

784
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:42,840
You're right about him!

785
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:45,680
You've always
been right about him!

786
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:48,040
Fear him! Fear him!

787
01:09:48,850 --> 01:09:49,950
Find us, Bruce!

788
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:52,620
You have to find us!

789
01:10:56,910 --> 01:10:59,020
The white Portuguese
is not a man.

790
01:10:59,020 --> 01:11:00,120
It's a ship.

791
01:11:02,790 --> 01:11:06,020
Master Wayne,
since the age of seven

792
01:11:06,020 --> 01:11:08,090
you have been to
the art of deception

793
01:11:08,090 --> 01:11:10,690
as Mozart to the harpsichord.

794
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:14,460
But you've never been
too hot at lying to me.

795
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:19,370
The white Portuguese is
not carrying a dirty bomb.

796
01:11:19,370 --> 01:11:21,000
What is it carrying?

797
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:23,540
It's a weapon.

798
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:26,110
It's a rock.

799
01:11:26,110 --> 01:11:29,710
A mineral capable of
weakening Kryptonian cells.

800
01:11:29,710 --> 01:11:31,450
The first sample big
enough to mean something

801
01:11:31,450 --> 01:11:33,480
turned up in the Indian
ocean three months ago.

802
01:11:33,490 --> 01:11:35,450
It is now aboard
the white Portuguese

803
01:11:35,450 --> 01:11:37,950
being delivered to Lex Luthor.

804
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:39,990
Who I am going to steal it from.

805
01:11:39,990 --> 01:11:41,920
To keep it out of
Luthor's hands.

806
01:11:41,930 --> 01:11:43,190
To destroy it.

807
01:11:44,630 --> 01:11:45,700
No.

808
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:50,900
You're gonna go to war?

809
01:11:50,900 --> 01:11:56,910
That son of a bitch brought
the war to us two years ago.

810
01:11:56,910 --> 01:12:00,510
Jesus, Alfred. Count the
dead. Thousands of people.

811
01:12:01,780 --> 01:12:04,610
What's next? Millions?

812
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:07,280
He has the power to wipe
out the entire human race,

813
01:12:07,290 --> 01:12:09,850
and if we believe there's even a
1% chance that he is our enemy,

814
01:12:09,850 --> 01:12:13,020
we have to take it as
an absolute certainty.

815
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:14,420
And we have to destroy him.

816
01:12:14,430 --> 01:12:17,090
But he is not our enemy.

817
01:12:17,930 --> 01:12:19,960
Not today.

818
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:22,670
20 years in Gotham, Alfred.

819
01:12:22,670 --> 01:12:24,600
We've seen what
promises are worth.

820
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:27,440
How many good guys are left.

821
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:30,510
How many stayed that way.

822
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:34,940
14 hours.

823
01:12:37,510 --> 01:12:40,050
My name is Clark Kent.
I'm from the Daily Planet.

824
01:12:43,690 --> 01:12:48,020
I'm trying to find out what
happened to an inmate, a Santos.

825
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:49,590
I can't give out
that information.

826
01:13:07,210 --> 01:13:08,540
Mommy!

827
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:14,880
Mrs. Santos?

828
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:17,350
May I ask you a few questions?

829
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:19,160
He wasn't my husband.

830
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:20,560
But I know what he did.

831
01:13:21,690 --> 01:13:23,860
But he was a father.

832
01:13:23,860 --> 01:13:25,830
He was that, too.

833
01:13:25,830 --> 01:13:27,430
They took him out
of Gotham Central.

834
01:13:27,430 --> 01:13:29,670
They moved him to Metropolis.

835
01:13:29,670 --> 01:13:31,570
But inside they know.

836
01:13:31,570 --> 01:13:34,070
They know the mark all
over. Guards don't care.

837
01:13:34,070 --> 01:13:35,470
Bat's the judge.

838
01:13:36,540 --> 01:13:38,240
One man decides who lives.

839
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:40,740
How is that justice? Talk to me.

840
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:43,780
Help me change it.
With what? Your pen?

841
01:13:43,780 --> 01:13:46,720
A man like that,
words don't stop him.

842
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:48,180
You know stops him?

843
01:13:48,850 --> 01:13:50,120
A fist.

844
01:13:54,090 --> 01:13:55,360
Kent, I want to talk to you.

845
01:13:57,900 --> 01:13:59,430
Kent!

846
01:13:59,430 --> 01:14:01,600
Where does he go?
Where does he go, Jenny?

847
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:03,600
I don't... I don't know.

848
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:04,800
Clicks his heels three times,

849
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:06,500
goes back to Kansas, I suppose.

850
01:14:08,410 --> 01:14:09,570
Son of a...

851
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:22,820
Turn it!

852
01:14:22,820 --> 01:14:24,350
Turn it!

853
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:09,230
Move out!

854
01:15:45,070 --> 01:15:46,300
Go, go, go, go!

855
01:16:25,340 --> 01:16:26,410
No!

856
01:17:51,460 --> 01:17:52,860
Where is he?

857
01:19:12,740 --> 01:19:15,440
Next time they shine
your light in the sky,

858
01:19:15,450 --> 01:19:17,280
don't go to it.

859
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:19,680
The Bat is dead. Bury it.

860
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:22,590
Consider this mercy.

861
01:19:24,790 --> 01:19:26,190
Tell me.

862
01:19:30,590 --> 01:19:32,130
Do you bleed?

863
01:19:40,770 --> 01:19:42,100
You will.

864
01:21:24,370 --> 01:21:27,210
I don't have a halo
over me, Mr. Secretary.

865
01:21:27,210 --> 01:21:29,250
I went into the
desert, people died.

866
01:21:29,250 --> 01:21:31,380
It keeps me awake. It should.

867
01:21:37,190 --> 01:21:38,890
If you think that
Superman is a murderer,

868
01:21:38,890 --> 01:21:40,890
then throw it away.

869
01:21:40,890 --> 01:21:42,790
But I don't believe
you think that.

870
01:21:45,860 --> 01:21:48,900
How do we determine what's good?

871
01:21:48,900 --> 01:21:51,730
In a democracy,
good is a conversation,

872
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:54,600
not a unilateral decision.

873
01:21:54,610 --> 01:21:57,270
So I urge Superman to come

874
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:59,070
to this hill of the
people tomorrow

875
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:01,780
to see those who have suffered.

876
01:22:01,780 --> 01:22:05,050
The world needs to know
what happened in that desert.

877
01:22:05,050 --> 01:22:07,550
And to know what he stands for.

878
01:22:07,550 --> 01:22:09,750
How far will he take his power?

879
01:22:11,290 --> 01:22:15,160
Does he act by our
will or by his own?

880
01:22:22,930 --> 01:22:25,830
People hate what
they don't understand.

881
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:31,110
But they see what you do,
and they know who you are.

882
01:22:32,610 --> 01:22:35,950
You're not a killer, a threat.

883
01:22:37,380 --> 01:22:39,680
I never wanted this
world to have you.

884
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:46,490
Be their hero, Clark.
Be their monument.

885
01:22:46,490 --> 01:22:48,490
Be their angel.

886
01:22:48,490 --> 01:22:50,360
Be anything they need you to be.

887
01:22:51,090 --> 01:22:52,800
Or be none of it.

888
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:56,800
You don't owe
this world a thing.

889
01:22:57,970 --> 01:22:59,640
You never did.

890
01:23:02,070 --> 01:23:05,340
This is Deniros. Transfer
available to Kane Avenue.

891
01:23:05,340 --> 01:23:06,810
Please, mind your step.

892
01:23:36,810 --> 01:23:39,110
I have to speak to
the Senator today.

893
01:23:39,110 --> 01:23:40,680
You cannot see
the Senator today.

894
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:42,180
I need to speak to
her before the hearing.

895
01:23:42,180 --> 01:23:44,110
Do you understand
how important this is?

896
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:45,650
I cannot let you
see the Senator.

897
01:23:45,650 --> 01:23:47,450
Please, I need to speak to her.

898
01:23:47,450 --> 01:23:50,350
Please, Madam. I beg of
you! Please don't do this!

899
01:23:50,350 --> 01:23:51,850
This is so important!

900
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:54,390
Come with me. Don't touch me!

901
01:23:54,390 --> 01:23:56,590
Please! I'm sorry.
She wouldn't leave.

902
01:23:58,360 --> 01:24:01,160
I didn't tell you the truth.

903
01:24:01,170 --> 01:24:04,070
C.I. Thinks the
desert was a setup.

904
01:24:04,070 --> 01:24:06,240
Somebody wanted
Superman to look guilty.

905
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:09,040
The bullet?

906
01:24:17,410 --> 01:24:18,880
The metal was developed
by a private company.

907
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:20,180
What company?

908
01:24:20,180 --> 01:24:21,780
LexCorp.

909
01:24:22,890 --> 01:24:24,720
Lex Luthor?

910
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:27,240
He also had private security
contractors at the desert compound.

911
01:24:31,530 --> 01:24:33,030
Go on record.

912
01:24:33,030 --> 01:24:36,730
Not a chance. It's classified.

913
01:24:36,730 --> 01:24:37,930
I happen to like my job.

914
01:24:37,940 --> 01:24:39,700
It doesn't make sense.

915
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:41,770
You said that the ambush was
arranged to frame Superman,

916
01:24:41,770 --> 01:24:44,110
but how could they know
that he'd show up in the...

917
01:24:50,710 --> 01:24:52,950
In the middle of the
desert. Thank you.

918
01:24:56,250 --> 01:24:59,860
The Senate hearing is expected
to get underway any minute now.

919
01:24:59,860 --> 01:25:02,090
And of course the big
unknown in all of this is

920
01:25:02,090 --> 01:25:03,590
will Superman show up?

921
01:25:03,590 --> 01:25:04,590
That is what they're
really waiting to see.

922
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:05,890
Mr. Keefe. Mr. Keefe.

923
01:25:05,900 --> 01:25:07,430
Soledad o'Brien, in the Moment.

924
01:25:07,430 --> 01:25:08,930
Quick question for you.

925
01:25:08,930 --> 01:25:10,300
You're heading in to
meet with the Senators.

926
01:25:10,300 --> 01:25:12,100
What will you tell them?

927
01:25:12,100 --> 01:25:15,040
I've come here to
tell them to wake up.

928
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:17,210
This is flesh and blood.

929
01:25:17,210 --> 01:25:18,640
He has delivered a war here.

930
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:20,880
And this...

931
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:22,240
This is what war looks like.

932
01:25:22,250 --> 01:25:24,410
I have nothing.

933
01:25:24,420 --> 01:25:26,780
There are plenty of people, sir,
who would say he's their hero.

934
01:25:26,780 --> 01:25:28,450
He is not a hero.

935
01:25:28,450 --> 01:25:31,450
Grace, can you get
Greg up here, please?

936
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:33,660
Right now.

937
01:25:33,660 --> 01:25:35,720
An anonymous source
can verify everything

938
01:25:35,730 --> 01:25:37,460
I told you about what
happened in Nairomi.

939
01:25:37,460 --> 01:25:40,100
An anonymous source? Run it.

940
01:25:40,100 --> 01:25:42,230
Luthor engineered the desert.

941
01:25:42,230 --> 01:25:44,400
It was an ambush for Superman.

942
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:45,970
Trust your reporter.
Think Watergate.

943
01:25:45,970 --> 01:25:48,100
Yeah, and you
need to think litigate.

944
01:25:48,110 --> 01:25:50,640
If you're wrong, Luthor will
sue the paper out of existence.

945
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:51,810
You need proof.

946
01:25:51,810 --> 01:25:53,340
No. It needs to run now.

947
01:25:53,340 --> 01:25:55,010
Before the hearing.

948
01:25:55,010 --> 01:25:56,510
If Superman knows, it
might change what he says.

949
01:25:56,510 --> 01:25:58,780
I am not going to risk the paper

950
01:25:58,780 --> 01:26:00,480
so that you can
pass notes in class

951
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:01,750
to the man that rescued you.

952
01:26:01,750 --> 01:26:03,320
McGraw: He paid her?

953
01:26:03,320 --> 01:26:06,120
Not only paid her.
He threatened her.

954
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:08,520
Gave her a script to learn.

955
01:26:08,530 --> 01:26:11,290
Her parents are alive back home.

956
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:13,300
But the girl's got a conscience.

957
01:26:13,300 --> 01:26:16,170
He's been using the committee
as his puppet theater. Senator!

958
01:26:16,930 --> 01:26:18,330
Hi, you.

959
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:19,700
Don't go anywhere.
I want to talk to you.

960
01:26:19,700 --> 01:26:21,700
Uh, you know what?
Mercy, you go in

961
01:26:21,710 --> 01:26:23,870
and make sure no
one takes my seat.

962
01:26:23,870 --> 01:26:25,140
So what you been up to?

963
01:26:25,140 --> 01:26:26,940
I'm just here to tell my story.

964
01:26:26,940 --> 01:26:28,480
That I was willing to finance
a Kryptonian deterrent,

965
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:30,150
but a certain junior
Senator from Kentucky

966
01:26:30,150 --> 01:26:32,210
decided to block it.

967
01:26:32,220 --> 01:26:35,850
Yes, the chair of the committee
on Superman is soft on security.

968
01:26:35,850 --> 01:26:38,520
Greg, why hasn't he been getting
our checks? He is, Mr. Wayne.

969
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:41,190
He gets a check from the
victims fund every month.

970
01:26:41,190 --> 01:26:43,690
He returns them.

971
01:26:43,690 --> 01:26:45,230
...who lost both his legs

972
01:26:45,230 --> 01:26:47,700
in those horrific
events in Metropolis

973
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:49,400
that happened two years ago.

974
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:50,600
Jesus.

975
01:26:52,670 --> 01:26:54,340
Why haven't I seen this?

976
01:26:54,340 --> 01:26:56,370
I'm sorry. I'll get
to the bottom of it.

977
01:26:56,370 --> 01:26:59,070
And there he is.
Superman is here.

978
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:01,340
He is actually at the
United States Capitol.

979
01:27:01,350 --> 01:27:03,480
This is really a
historic moment.

980
01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:05,810
Now we expect that
Superman will give

981
01:27:05,820 --> 01:27:07,880
some kind of a
statement to the Senate, 

982
01:27:07,890 --> 01:27:10,620
to the American people,
and, of course, to the world.

983
01:27:11,390 --> 01:27:12,890
He's here. He came.

984
01:27:12,890 --> 01:27:15,390
He's above the Capitol. Ah.

985
01:27:15,390 --> 01:27:18,060
You are gonna be on the
hot seat in there, Junebug.

986
01:27:18,060 --> 01:27:19,730
I grew up on a farm.

987
01:27:19,730 --> 01:27:22,200
I know how to wrestle a pig.

988
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:24,400
Do you know the oldest
lie in America, Senator?

989
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:27,300
It's that power can be innocent.

990
01:27:29,410 --> 01:27:30,640
Good luck.

991
01:28:06,540 --> 01:28:08,710
Oh, Miss...

992
01:28:08,710 --> 01:28:10,510
Rudy, she's good to go.

993
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:20,060
Get out!

994
01:28:23,330 --> 01:28:26,160
Get out! Get out!
Superman! Superman!

995
01:28:33,270 --> 01:28:35,370
Another one came this
morning, Mr. Wayne.

996
01:29:14,540 --> 01:29:17,480
Let me say at the outset
that I'm grateful to our witness

997
01:29:17,480 --> 01:29:20,350
for coming before us today.

998
01:29:20,350 --> 01:29:23,120
This is how a democracy works.

999
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:25,850
We talk to each other.

1000
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:31,360
We act by the consent
of the governed, sir.

1001
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:34,700
I have sat here before to
say that shadow interventions

1002
01:29:34,700 --> 01:29:37,700
will not be tolerated
by this committee.

1003
01:29:37,700 --> 01:29:39,230
Neither will lies.

1004
01:29:40,870 --> 01:29:44,310
Because today
is a day for truth.

1005
01:29:46,140 --> 01:29:47,780
Because only by speaking...

1006
01:29:58,220 --> 01:30:02,390
Only by working
together can we...

1007
01:30:08,500 --> 01:30:09,770
Can we...

1008
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:23,010
Can we create a free, and a...

1009
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:53,340
Oh, my God!

1010
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:20,000
We're back at the
Nation's Capitol, 

1011
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:21,700
where something is happening.

1012
01:31:39,690 --> 01:31:40,920
Excuse me.

1013
01:31:41,820 --> 01:31:44,160
Excuse me, officer.

1014
01:31:44,160 --> 01:31:46,660
Member of the press.
Can you let me in, please?

1015
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:56,200
Breathe slowly and deeply.

1016
01:31:56,210 --> 01:31:57,910
You're gonna be fine.

1017
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:10,350
Thank you. I'm gonna
need a little room to work.

1018
01:32:10,350 --> 01:32:13,820
Ma'am, it appears you've
suffered a head injury.

1019
01:32:13,820 --> 01:32:16,790
I'm gonna need you to
follow my light with your eyes.

1020
01:33:06,910 --> 01:33:08,440
Master Wayne.

1021
01:33:11,510 --> 01:33:14,420
Mr. Wayne!

1022
01:33:14,420 --> 01:33:18,620
...in the Senate hearing room
where Superman was testifying.

1023
01:33:18,620 --> 01:33:21,520
This is a catastrophic
situation at our Nation's Capitol.

1024
01:33:21,530 --> 01:33:23,190
We don't have exact numbers yet, 

1025
01:33:23,190 --> 01:33:25,260
but I can tell you that
more than a dozen people

1026
01:33:25,260 --> 01:33:26,930
have died in this explosion.

1027
01:33:26,930 --> 01:33:28,360
First responders
are at the scene.

1028
01:33:28,370 --> 01:33:30,770
They are still
bringing victims out.

1029
01:33:30,770 --> 01:33:34,600
Now initially, Superman was
helping bring victims out after the blast

1030
01:33:34,610 --> 01:33:36,810
but he seems to
have disappeared...

1031
01:33:36,810 --> 01:33:38,640
...raising questions.

1032
01:33:38,640 --> 01:33:41,380
Carrie Birmingham, reporting
live from the Nation's Capital.

1033
01:33:41,380 --> 01:33:44,210
Capitol police are now confirming
that the blast was caused

1034
01:33:44,210 --> 01:33:46,310
by an explosive device
inside the hearing room.

1035
01:34:11,810 --> 01:34:14,010
Run that one more time for me.

1036
01:34:14,010 --> 01:34:17,080
Can you enhance
that? There you go, sir.

1037
01:34:55,950 --> 01:34:58,220
Capitol police are
confirming to CNN

1038
01:34:58,220 --> 01:34:59,790
that the suspected bomber is.

1039
01:34:59,790 --> 01:35:02,320
Wallace Vernon Keefe.
Now these sources...

1040
01:35:02,330 --> 01:35:04,360
Clark, it's me again. Can you...

1041
01:35:04,360 --> 01:35:06,530
...could have gotten the
explosive device into the hearing

1042
01:35:06,530 --> 01:35:08,900
by concealing them
inside his wheelchair.

1043
01:35:08,900 --> 01:35:10,830
As for Superman,
he was in the room, 

1044
01:35:10,830 --> 01:35:12,330
but obviously
failed to stop him.

1045
01:35:12,340 --> 01:35:14,800
I didn't see it, lo.

1046
01:35:14,810 --> 01:35:16,870
I was standing right
there and I didn't see it.

1047
01:35:16,870 --> 01:35:18,540
Clark, there are
people behind this.

1048
01:35:18,540 --> 01:35:20,780
I'm afraid I didn't see it
because I wasn't looking.

1049
01:35:24,210 --> 01:35:26,350
All this time,

1050
01:35:26,350 --> 01:35:28,920
I've been living my life
the way my father saw it.

1051
01:35:30,050 --> 01:35:31,720
Righting wrongs for a ghost.

1052
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:36,390
Thinking I'm here to do good.

1053
01:35:40,700 --> 01:35:43,100
Superman was never real.

1054
01:35:43,100 --> 01:35:45,800
Just the dream of a
farmer from Kansas.

1055
01:35:47,400 --> 01:35:50,910
That farmer's dream
is all some people have.

1056
01:35:50,910 --> 01:35:52,670
It's all that gives them hope.

1057
01:36:04,050 --> 01:36:05,950
This means something.

1058
01:36:07,260 --> 01:36:10,190
It did on my world.

1059
01:36:10,190 --> 01:36:12,160
My world doesn't exist anymore.

1060
01:37:31,270 --> 01:37:33,110
Welcome.

1061
01:37:33,110 --> 01:37:38,680
Analysis reveals ship
operating at 37% efficiency.

1062
01:37:38,680 --> 01:37:40,680
Would you like to
assume command?

1063
01:37:41,350 --> 01:37:43,350
Yes, I would.

1064
01:37:43,350 --> 01:37:45,490
Yes, I would.

1065
01:37:45,490 --> 01:37:48,720
Very well. Let's begin.

1066
01:37:48,730 --> 01:37:53,700
The Kryptonian archive contains
knowledge from 100,000 different worlds.

1067
01:37:53,700 --> 01:37:55,160
Good.

1068
01:37:55,170 --> 01:37:56,360
Teach me.

1069
01:40:27,180 --> 01:40:28,680
Alexander Luthor, 

1070
01:40:28,690 --> 01:40:31,390
your security override
has been accepted.

1071
01:40:31,390 --> 01:40:34,190
Genesis chamber ready
to analyze genetic sample.

1072
01:40:37,690 --> 01:40:40,800
Acknowledging presence
of genetic material.

1073
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:42,030
Analyzing.

1074
01:40:44,870 --> 01:40:48,740
I've identified the host
as General Zod of Kandor.

1075
01:41:04,550 --> 01:41:07,220
Acknowledging presence
of foreign genetic material.

1076
01:41:07,220 --> 01:41:09,420
Analyzing.

1077
01:41:09,430 --> 01:41:11,790
You flew too close to the sun.

1078
01:41:14,060 --> 01:41:15,960
Now look at you.

1079
01:41:17,230 --> 01:41:20,670
Advising. Action forbidden.

1080
01:41:20,670 --> 01:41:22,740
It has been decreed
by the council of Krypton

1081
01:41:22,740 --> 01:41:26,240
that none will ever again
give life to a deformity

1082
01:41:26,240 --> 01:41:28,280
so hateful to sight and memory.

1083
01:41:28,280 --> 01:41:31,110
The desecration without name.

1084
01:41:31,110 --> 01:41:33,480
And where is the
council of Krypton?

1085
01:41:34,420 --> 01:41:35,620
Destroyed, sir.

1086
01:41:36,790 --> 01:41:38,920
Then proceed.

1087
01:41:38,920 --> 01:41:43,320
Very well. Preparing chrysalis
and commencing metamorphosis.

1088
01:41:45,860 --> 01:41:47,600
"And so we are left to wonder

1089
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:51,070
"if Superman was aware
of the threat and did nothing,

1090
01:41:51,070 --> 01:41:54,240
"was he then complicit
in the capitol tragedy?"

1091
01:41:54,240 --> 01:41:55,870
Still no Kent?

1092
01:41:55,870 --> 01:41:57,440
"His disappearance
raises questions."

1093
01:41:57,440 --> 01:41:59,440
No.

1094
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:01,380
There are still so many
unanswered questions.

1095
01:42:01,380 --> 01:42:03,280
Chief among them, whether
Superman was involved

1096
01:42:03,280 --> 01:42:05,050
in the planning of this attack.

1097
01:42:05,050 --> 01:42:07,320
I mean, here's an individual
who has unlimited power, 

1098
01:42:07,320 --> 01:42:10,450
yet did nothing to stop the bomber
just a few feet away from him.

1099
01:42:10,450 --> 01:42:13,120
It just doesn't add
up for investigators.

1100
01:42:13,120 --> 01:42:14,620
Burn him, burn him, burn him.

1101
01:42:14,620 --> 01:42:17,190
Burn him, burn him, burn him.

1102
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:42,550
For twenty American,
he didn't see you.

1103
01:42:43,690 --> 01:42:44,750
Same for me.

1104
01:42:55,960 --> 01:42:59,170
Now one FBI official
familiar with this case

1105
01:42:59,170 --> 01:43:01,340
told me they found quote, 

1106
01:43:01,340 --> 01:43:04,770
"a jackpot of bomb-making
materials inside Keefe's apartment."

1107
01:43:04,770 --> 01:43:07,110
What they need
to determine now is

1108
01:43:07,110 --> 01:43:09,840
whether he had any help in the
planning and execution of the bombing.

1109
01:43:09,850 --> 01:43:12,050
And they haven't
ruled out the idea

1110
01:43:12,050 --> 01:43:15,150
that Superman was
a co-conspirator.

1111
01:43:15,150 --> 01:43:17,680
Now, my sources are
telling me they are getting

1112
01:43:17,690 --> 01:43:19,850
a barrage of anonymous
and credible tips

1113
01:43:19,860 --> 01:43:22,290
with all roads in
this investigation

1114
01:43:22,290 --> 01:43:24,730
leading to the
Kryptonian visitor.

1115
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:03,900
All right, Lois. You gotta go.

1116
01:44:20,580 --> 01:44:22,480
He didn't know he was gonna die.

1117
01:44:24,250 --> 01:44:25,750
He just bought groceries.

1118
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:27,960
The wheelchair and
the bullet from the desert

1119
01:44:27,960 --> 01:44:29,720
were made from the same metal.

1120
01:44:29,730 --> 01:44:31,290
I know. The desert. The hearing.

1121
01:44:31,290 --> 01:44:34,200
Everywhere Superman
goes, Luthor wants death.

1122
01:44:34,200 --> 01:44:36,460
But, Luthor goes
through all of that trouble...

1123
01:44:36,470 --> 01:44:37,900
Creates a bomb
out of a wheelchair,

1124
01:44:37,900 --> 01:44:39,800
and then alters it
to reduce the blast?

1125
01:44:39,800 --> 01:44:41,640
What do you mean?

1126
01:44:41,640 --> 01:44:44,270
The inside of the chair
was lined with lead.

1127
01:44:46,780 --> 01:44:48,410
You couldn't stop it.

1128
01:44:48,410 --> 01:44:50,680
You couldn't see it.

1129
01:45:33,190 --> 01:45:34,590
Something, isn't it?

1130
01:45:36,460 --> 01:45:38,430
We men of Kansas
live on a pancake,

1131
01:45:38,430 --> 01:45:40,030
so we come to the mountains.

1132
01:45:41,530 --> 01:45:45,330
All downhill from here,
down to the floodplain.

1133
01:45:45,340 --> 01:45:47,230
Farm at the bottom of the world.

1134
01:45:49,170 --> 01:45:52,210
I remember one season
the water came bad.

1135
01:45:52,210 --> 01:45:54,140
I couldn't have been 12.

1136
01:45:54,140 --> 01:45:57,140
Dad had out the shovels
and we went at it all night.

1137
01:45:57,150 --> 01:45:59,310
We worked till,
I think, I fainted.

1138
01:45:59,320 --> 01:46:01,120
But we managed
to stop the water.

1139
01:46:02,350 --> 01:46:05,390
We saved the farm.

1140
01:46:05,390 --> 01:46:08,590
Your grandma baked me
a cake. Said I was a hero.

1141
01:46:11,030 --> 01:46:12,760
Later that day we found out

1142
01:46:14,030 --> 01:46:15,200
we blocked the water all right.

1143
01:46:15,200 --> 01:46:17,700
We sent it upstream.

1144
01:46:17,700 --> 01:46:21,240
The whole lang farm washed away.

1145
01:46:21,240 --> 01:46:24,240
While I ate my hero cake,
their horses were drowning.

1146
01:46:27,080 --> 01:46:29,880
I used to hear them
wailing in my sleep.

1147
01:46:33,250 --> 01:46:35,220
Did the nightmares ever stop?

1148
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:38,890
Yeah.

1149
01:46:39,890 --> 01:46:41,820
When I met your mother.

1150
01:46:43,830 --> 01:46:46,660
She gave me faith that
there's good in this world.

1151
01:46:49,060 --> 01:46:51,470
She was my world.

1152
01:46:54,070 --> 01:46:55,670
I miss you, son.

1153
01:47:00,580 --> 01:47:02,640
I miss you too, Dad.

1154
01:47:22,430 --> 01:47:23,860
You know you can't win this.

1155
01:47:25,770 --> 01:47:27,370
It's suicide.

1156
01:47:30,110 --> 01:47:33,170
I'm older now than
my father ever was.

1157
01:47:35,480 --> 01:47:39,280
This may be the only
thing I do that matters.

1158
01:47:39,280 --> 01:47:43,220
20 years of fighting
criminals amounts to nothing?

1159
01:47:43,220 --> 01:47:45,950
Criminals are
like weeds, Alfred.

1160
01:47:45,960 --> 01:47:48,360
Pull one up, another
grows in its place.

1161
01:47:50,430 --> 01:47:52,630
This is about the
future of the world.

1162
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:56,030
This is my legacy.

1163
01:47:57,270 --> 01:47:59,630
My father sat me
down right here.

1164
01:47:59,640 --> 01:48:01,800
Told me what Wayne
manor was built on.

1165
01:48:01,800 --> 01:48:05,310
Railroads, real
estates, and oil.

1166
01:48:05,310 --> 01:48:08,980
The first generation made their
fortune trading with the French.

1167
01:48:08,980 --> 01:48:10,680
Pelts and skins.

1168
01:48:14,480 --> 01:48:16,220
They were hunters.

1169
01:48:32,600 --> 01:48:36,370
So falls the house of Wayne.

1170
01:48:36,370 --> 01:48:38,170
We gotta wait for more evidence, 

1171
01:48:38,170 --> 01:48:40,140
but the question still remains, 

1172
01:48:40,140 --> 01:48:42,010
where is he?

1173
01:48:42,010 --> 01:48:44,350
If Superman was not involved, 

1174
01:48:44,350 --> 01:48:47,720
if he's got nothing to hide,
then why hasn't he been seen

1175
01:48:47,720 --> 01:48:49,650
since the day of this tragedy?

1176
01:48:49,650 --> 01:48:51,720
You can't point a finger and...

1177
01:48:51,720 --> 01:48:53,620
I'm not pointing anything,
Warren. Look. Ten fingers, see?

1178
01:48:53,620 --> 01:48:55,290
If there is going
to be a criminal...

1179
01:50:24,050 --> 01:50:25,850
The night is here.

1180
01:50:56,480 --> 01:50:57,540
Excuse me.

1181
01:50:59,750 --> 01:51:00,980
Don't I know...

1182
01:52:04,080 --> 01:52:07,920
Plain lo in the
morning. Lola in slacks.

1183
01:52:09,150 --> 01:52:10,280
Lois Lane.

1184
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:14,520
Mmm. Come see the view.

1185
01:52:14,520 --> 01:52:15,720
Um...

1186
01:52:15,730 --> 01:52:16,890
Mmm-mmm.

1187
01:52:16,890 --> 01:52:19,090
Now the secret to the height

1188
01:52:19,100 --> 01:52:21,400
is the building material.

1189
01:52:21,400 --> 01:52:24,900
It's light metals which
sway a bit in the wind.

1190
01:52:25,900 --> 01:52:26,970
Hmm.

1191
01:52:29,570 --> 01:52:32,910
And you know something about
LexCorp metals, don't you, Miss Lane?

1192
01:52:32,910 --> 01:52:34,780
I've proven what you've done.

1193
01:52:34,780 --> 01:52:36,880
Wow, you're feisty.

1194
01:52:36,880 --> 01:52:39,380
Unfortunately,
that will blow away.

1195
01:52:39,380 --> 01:52:41,420
Like sand in the desert.

1196
01:52:41,420 --> 01:52:42,550
You're psychotic.

1197
01:52:42,550 --> 01:52:44,020
That is a three-syllable word

1198
01:52:44,020 --> 01:52:46,550
for any thought too
big for little minds.

1199
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:49,360
Hmm. Next category: Circles.

1200
01:52:49,360 --> 01:52:54,130
Round and round and round
they go to find Superman.

1201
01:52:54,130 --> 01:52:56,260
Wrong category,
boy. No, no, triangles.

1202
01:52:56,270 --> 01:52:57,870
Yes, Euclid's
triangle inequality.

1203
01:52:57,870 --> 01:53:00,070
The shortest distance
between any two points

1204
01:53:00,070 --> 01:53:01,870
is a straight path.

1205
01:53:01,870 --> 01:53:04,810
And I believe the
straightest path to Superman

1206
01:53:04,810 --> 01:53:06,310
is a pretty little road...

1207
01:53:06,310 --> 01:53:08,740
Mmm. Called Lois Lane.

1208
01:53:31,270 --> 01:53:32,700
You came back.

1209
01:53:33,570 --> 01:53:34,900
You came back.

1210
01:53:54,160 --> 01:53:56,360
Boy, do we have
problems up here!

1211
01:54:00,930 --> 01:54:03,330
The problem of...
of evil in the world.

1212
01:54:03,330 --> 01:54:05,530
Uh, the problem
of absolute virtue.

1213
01:54:05,530 --> 01:54:07,700
I'll take you in
without breaking you.

1214
01:54:07,700 --> 01:54:09,500
Which is more than you deserve.

1215
01:54:09,510 --> 01:54:11,970
The problem of you on
top of everything else.

1216
01:54:11,970 --> 01:54:13,670
You above all.

1217
01:54:13,680 --> 01:54:16,180
Ah, because that's what God is.

1218
01:54:16,180 --> 01:54:20,250
Horus. Apollo. Jehovah. Kal-El.

1219
01:54:21,180 --> 01:54:24,550
Clark Joseph Kent.

1220
01:54:26,320 --> 01:54:30,520
See, what we call God depends
upon our tribe, Clark-Joe.

1221
01:54:30,530 --> 01:54:33,660
Because God is
tribal. God takes sides.

1222
01:54:33,660 --> 01:54:35,660
No man in the sky
intervened when I was a boy

1223
01:54:35,660 --> 01:54:38,700
to deliver me from Daddy's
fist and abominations. Mmm.

1224
01:54:38,700 --> 01:54:42,500
I figured out way back,
if God is all-powerful,

1225
01:54:42,500 --> 01:54:43,940
he cannot be all-good.

1226
01:54:45,640 --> 01:54:47,210
And if he is all-good,

1227
01:54:47,210 --> 01:54:49,540
then he cannot be all-powerful.

1228
01:54:49,550 --> 01:54:51,140
And neither can you be.

1229
01:54:52,350 --> 01:54:54,380
They need to see
the fraud you are.

1230
01:54:54,980 --> 01:54:56,280
With their eyes.

1231
01:54:57,550 --> 01:55:00,420
The blood on your hands.

1232
01:55:00,420 --> 01:55:01,590
What have you done?

1233
01:55:01,590 --> 01:55:03,490
Hmm. And tonight, they will.

1234
01:55:03,490 --> 01:55:07,660
Yes. Because you, my
friend, have a date. Hmm.

1235
01:55:07,660 --> 01:55:09,160
Across the bay.

1236
01:55:09,160 --> 01:55:11,730
Ripe fruit, his hate.
Two years growing.

1237
01:55:11,730 --> 01:55:13,770
But it did not take much
to push him over, actually.

1238
01:55:13,770 --> 01:55:15,340
Little red notes, big bang.

1239
01:55:15,340 --> 01:55:18,070
You let your family die!

1240
01:55:18,070 --> 01:55:23,780
And now you will fly to
him. And you will battle him.

1241
01:55:23,780 --> 01:55:25,350
To the death.

1242
01:55:26,580 --> 01:55:29,620
Black and blue. Fight night!

1243
01:55:29,620 --> 01:55:33,120
The greatest gladiator match
in the history of the world.

1244
01:55:33,120 --> 01:55:35,960
God versus man.

1245
01:55:35,960 --> 01:55:38,860
Day versus night.

1246
01:55:38,860 --> 01:55:41,930
Son of Krypton
versus Bat of Gotham.

1247
01:55:41,930 --> 01:55:44,200
You think I'll
fight him for you?

1248
01:55:44,200 --> 01:55:46,970
Hmm, yes, I do. I think
you will fight-fight-fight

1249
01:55:46,970 --> 01:55:48,940
for that special
lady in your life.

1250
01:55:48,940 --> 01:55:51,240
She's safe on the
ground. How about you?

1251
01:55:51,240 --> 01:55:54,880
Close, but I am not
talking about Lois.

1252
01:55:54,880 --> 01:55:59,280
No. Every boy's special
lady is his mother.

1253
01:56:04,950 --> 01:56:07,450
Martha, Martha, Martha.

1254
01:56:07,960 --> 01:56:09,420
Hmm.

1255
01:56:09,430 --> 01:56:13,390
Why, the mother of a flying
demon must be a witch.

1256
01:56:13,400 --> 01:56:16,260
The punishment for
witches, what is that?

1257
01:56:16,270 --> 01:56:18,400
That's right. Death by fire.

1258
01:56:20,440 --> 01:56:22,000
Mmm.

1259
01:56:27,980 --> 01:56:30,010
Where is she?

1260
01:56:30,010 --> 01:56:31,810
I don't know! I would
not let them tell me!

1261
01:56:31,810 --> 01:56:34,310
Uh-uh-uh! If you
kill me, Martha dies.

1262
01:56:34,320 --> 01:56:36,480
And if you fly away,
mmm, Martha also dies.

1263
01:56:36,490 --> 01:56:39,490
But if you kill the bat...

1264
01:56:39,490 --> 01:56:40,920
Martha lives.

1265
01:56:45,830 --> 01:56:49,100
There we go. There we go. Hmm.

1266
01:56:51,670 --> 01:56:55,600
And now God bends to my will.

1267
01:57:01,280 --> 01:57:04,180
Ooh, now the cameras
are waiting at your ship.

1268
01:57:04,180 --> 01:57:06,450
For the world to see
the holes in the Holy.

1269
01:57:06,450 --> 01:57:07,950
Yes, the almighty comes clean

1270
01:57:07,950 --> 01:57:09,320
about how dirty he
is when it counts.

1271
01:57:09,320 --> 01:57:11,020
To save Martha,

1272
01:57:11,020 --> 01:57:12,690
bring me the head of the Bat.

1273
01:57:16,190 --> 01:57:17,490
Ah.

1274
01:57:17,490 --> 01:57:20,360
Mother of God, would
you look at the time?

1275
01:57:20,360 --> 01:57:22,700
When you came
here, you had an hour.

1276
01:57:23,970 --> 01:57:25,870
Now it's less.

1277
01:58:27,530 --> 01:58:29,230
Brooke Baldwin is on the scene.

1278
01:58:29,230 --> 01:58:31,470
Brooke, you're live on the
air. What are you seeing?

1279
01:58:31,470 --> 01:58:33,030
There's something
happening at the ship.

1280
01:58:34,440 --> 01:58:37,240
It's sending massive
power surges.

1281
01:58:37,240 --> 01:58:39,070
Police helicopters
surrounding the area.

1282
01:58:39,070 --> 01:58:41,810
They've created a barricade
around this containment center.

1283
01:58:41,810 --> 01:58:43,410
And we're trying to
get a little bit closer here

1284
01:58:43,410 --> 01:58:45,110
to find out what's going on.

1285
01:58:45,110 --> 01:58:47,110
It is absolute chaos.
You can see that lightning, 

1286
01:58:47,120 --> 01:58:48,780
those surges of electricity.

1287
01:58:48,780 --> 01:58:52,050
They seem to be getting
stronger by the minute.

1288
01:58:52,050 --> 01:58:54,790
Daily Planet.

1289
01:58:54,790 --> 01:58:59,160
Lois. I have to go to Gotham
to convince him to help me.

1290
01:58:59,160 --> 01:59:00,230
Who?

1291
01:59:02,600 --> 01:59:04,630
Or he has to die.

1292
01:59:04,630 --> 01:59:05,870
Clark.

1293
01:59:09,240 --> 01:59:11,400
No one stays good in this world.

1294
01:59:20,350 --> 01:59:24,350
But as of right now, much of the
city remains in the dark tonight.

1295
01:59:24,350 --> 01:59:28,690
Much chaos. Much confusing happening
on the streets of Metropolis tonight.

1296
01:59:28,690 --> 01:59:30,860
Those helicopters are
still surrounding the area.

1297
01:59:30,860 --> 01:59:33,390
I don't know if you can still
see those bolts of lightning...

1298
02:01:35,250 --> 02:01:40,290
2400 hours and 2 minutes.
Subject declining rapidly.

1299
02:01:40,290 --> 02:01:42,360
All procedural
interventions have failed.

1300
02:01:43,220 --> 02:01:44,790
Outcome

1301
02:01:47,400 --> 02:01:48,660
will be death.

1302
02:01:57,340 --> 02:02:00,140
Dr. Silas stone suspending
all clinical protocol.

1303
02:02:00,140 --> 02:02:06,880
US gov, object 6-19-82
is successfully activated.

1304
02:02:28,500 --> 02:02:29,800
I need a chopper to Gotham.

1305
02:02:29,810 --> 02:02:31,200
Call the heliport.

1306
02:02:31,210 --> 02:02:32,970
Chopper? We can
barely afford a bicycle.

1307
02:02:32,970 --> 02:02:34,140
You wanna chase a story?

1308
02:02:34,140 --> 02:02:35,440
Go to the ship.

1309
02:02:35,440 --> 02:02:36,810
Superman's probably
there already.

1310
02:02:36,810 --> 02:02:39,580
Perry, it's not for a story.

1311
02:02:44,450 --> 02:02:46,150
Jenny, get her a
chopper to Gotham.

1312
02:02:46,150 --> 02:02:48,690
And forget the heliport.
Put it on the Goddamn roof.

1313
02:02:48,690 --> 02:02:50,190
On the roof, Lois!

1314
02:02:52,860 --> 02:02:54,530
Where are we headed?

1315
02:02:54,530 --> 02:02:55,730
There!

1316
02:03:11,710 --> 02:03:14,750
Well, here I am.

1317
02:03:16,080 --> 02:03:17,450
Bruce. Please.

1318
02:03:19,220 --> 02:03:22,090
I was wrong. You
have to listen to me.

1319
02:03:22,090 --> 02:03:23,320
Lex wants us to...

1320
02:03:38,740 --> 02:03:41,070
You don't understand.

1321
02:03:41,080 --> 02:03:42,440
There's no time!

1322
02:03:44,080 --> 02:03:45,250
I understand.

1323
02:05:01,760 --> 02:05:03,320
Stay down!

1324
02:05:03,330 --> 02:05:05,760
If I wanted it, you'd
be dead already.

1325
02:05:43,830 --> 02:05:45,130
Breathe it in.

1326
02:05:47,900 --> 02:05:49,770
That's fear.

1327
02:05:52,670 --> 02:05:54,110
You're not brave.

1328
02:05:58,410 --> 02:05:59,950
Men are brave.

1329
02:09:49,710 --> 02:09:54,380
I bet your parents taught
you that you mean something.

1330
02:09:54,380 --> 02:09:56,050
That you're here for a reason.

1331
02:09:57,550 --> 02:10:01,250
My parents taught
me a different lesson, 

1332
02:10:01,260 --> 02:10:03,720
dying in the gutter

1333
02:10:03,730 --> 02:10:05,730
for no reason at all.

1334
02:10:22,480 --> 02:10:25,140
They taught me the
world only makes sense

1335
02:10:25,150 --> 02:10:27,210
if you force it to.

1336
02:11:05,550 --> 02:11:07,450
You were never a God.

1337
02:11:10,220 --> 02:11:12,390
You were never even a man.

1338
02:11:19,330 --> 02:11:22,700
You're letting him kill Martha.

1339
02:11:28,340 --> 02:11:30,140
What does that mean?

1340
02:11:31,350 --> 02:11:32,910
Why did you say that name?

1341
02:11:34,180 --> 02:11:36,750
Find him.

1342
02:11:37,990 --> 02:11:39,690
Save.

1343
02:11:39,690 --> 02:11:41,390
Martha.

1344
02:11:44,320 --> 02:11:45,730
Martha.

1345
02:12:16,520 --> 02:12:18,420
Martha.

1346
02:12:22,630 --> 02:12:23,800
Why did you say that name?

1347
02:12:25,730 --> 02:12:27,570
Martha! Why did
you say that name?

1348
02:12:27,570 --> 02:12:28,870
Clark! Stop!

1349
02:12:28,870 --> 02:12:30,240
Please! Stop!

1350
02:12:30,240 --> 02:12:31,900
Why did you say that name?

1351
02:12:31,910 --> 02:12:34,370
It's his mother's name!

1352
02:12:34,380 --> 02:12:36,640
It's his mother's name.

1353
02:13:08,240 --> 02:13:09,780
We're not getting any answers.

1354
02:13:09,780 --> 02:13:11,310
We're still right outside
the containment center.

1355
02:13:11,310 --> 02:13:12,510
A dangerous situation.

1356
02:13:12,510 --> 02:13:13,950
Military and police personnel

1357
02:13:13,950 --> 02:13:15,510
surrounding the area.

1358
02:13:31,030 --> 02:13:32,300
Luthor.

1359
02:13:32,300 --> 02:13:34,770
He wanted your life for hers.

1360
02:13:35,970 --> 02:13:37,800
She's losing time.

1361
02:13:37,810 --> 02:13:40,710
The scout ship seems to be
drawing power from the city.

1362
02:13:40,710 --> 02:13:42,270
It's got to be Lex.

1363
02:13:42,280 --> 02:13:45,010
They need you at
that ship. I'll find her.

1364
02:13:45,010 --> 02:13:47,110
My mother needs me. Wait.

1365
02:13:48,220 --> 02:13:50,650
I'll make you a promise.

1366
02:13:50,650 --> 02:13:52,920
Martha won't die tonight.

1367
02:14:19,650 --> 02:14:21,010
Master Wayne.

1368
02:14:21,020 --> 02:14:22,250
Alfred.

1369
02:14:22,250 --> 02:14:24,020
Uh, I'm sorry for listening in,

1370
02:14:24,020 --> 02:14:25,550
but I've tracked
the Russian's phone

1371
02:14:25,550 --> 02:14:27,220
to a warehouse near the port.

1372
02:14:27,220 --> 02:14:28,750
You're locked onto it.

1373
02:14:28,760 --> 02:14:30,320
I don't deserve you, Alfred.

1374
02:14:30,320 --> 02:14:32,790
No, sir. You don't.

1375
02:14:53,550 --> 02:14:55,480
I'm afraid this is goodbye.

1376
02:14:57,380 --> 02:15:01,590
And every time we say
goodbye, you die a little.

1377
02:15:14,730 --> 02:15:16,540
- Take it down.
- Go! Go!

1378
02:15:39,890 --> 02:15:41,230
You have to take it, Alfred.

1379
02:15:41,900 --> 02:15:43,800
Ah, right.

1380
02:15:43,800 --> 02:15:45,870
Commencing drone mode.

1381
02:15:48,840 --> 02:15:50,670
Thermal imaging is showing me

1382
02:15:50,670 --> 02:15:53,270
two dozen hostiles
on the third floor.

1383
02:15:53,270 --> 02:15:55,670
Why don't I drop you
off on the second?

1384
02:19:00,760 --> 02:19:02,490
Drop it.

1385
02:19:04,160 --> 02:19:06,070
I said drop it!

1386
02:19:07,030 --> 02:19:08,370
I'll kill her.

1387
02:19:10,200 --> 02:19:12,440
Believe me, I'll do it.

1388
02:19:15,310 --> 02:19:16,440
I believe you.

1389
02:19:28,820 --> 02:19:31,860
It's okay. I'm a
friend of your son's.

1390
02:19:31,860 --> 02:19:34,760
I figured. The cape.

1391
02:20:02,860 --> 02:20:04,390
"Late, late," says
the white rabbit.

1392
02:20:04,390 --> 02:20:06,190
40 seconds to animation.

1393
02:20:06,190 --> 02:20:07,830
Right, wabbit?

1394
02:20:07,830 --> 02:20:11,600
Hmm. Out of tricks, out of time.

1395
02:20:12,670 --> 02:20:15,170
And one Bat head short.

1396
02:20:15,170 --> 02:20:17,000
30 seconds to animation.

1397
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:18,770
Ah. That'll be the cook.

1398
02:20:18,770 --> 02:20:19,940
Excuse me.

1399
02:20:19,940 --> 02:20:22,880
Uh, Gotham roast. Well done.

1400
02:20:22,880 --> 02:20:25,040
Hello. Break the bad news.

1401
02:20:25,050 --> 02:20:27,950
I'd rather do the
breaking in person.

1402
02:20:27,950 --> 02:20:29,680
20 seconds to animation.

1403
02:20:29,680 --> 02:20:30,750
You've lost.

1404
02:20:31,720 --> 02:20:32,950
I don't know how to lose.

1405
02:20:32,950 --> 02:20:34,120
You'll learn.

1406
02:20:34,120 --> 02:20:35,750
I'll learn.

1407
02:20:35,760 --> 02:20:38,260
I don't hate the sinner.

1408
02:20:38,260 --> 02:20:40,360
- I hate the sin.
- 10 seconds to animation.

1409
02:20:40,360 --> 02:20:43,030
And yours, my
friend, is existing.

1410
02:20:43,860 --> 02:20:45,460
I cannot let you win.

1411
02:20:45,470 --> 02:20:46,730
I gave the bat a
fighting chance to do it,

1412
02:20:46,730 --> 02:20:47,800
but he was not strong enough.

1413
02:20:47,800 --> 02:20:49,800
So, if man won't kill God...

1414
02:20:49,800 --> 02:20:51,970
...two, one.

1415
02:20:53,640 --> 02:20:54,740
...the Devil will do it!

1416
02:21:11,460 --> 02:21:12,890
Perry!

1417
02:21:12,890 --> 02:21:15,560
All right. Stay calm, everybody!

1418
02:21:15,560 --> 02:21:17,000
We're getting reports
there are total blackouts

1419
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,770
in the north and to the
northwest of the city.

1420
02:21:19,770 --> 02:21:21,170
Federal authorities
are trying to determine

1421
02:21:21,170 --> 02:21:23,470
if this is part of a
larger terrorist attack.

1422
02:21:27,840 --> 02:21:30,940
Ancient Kryptonian deformity.

1423
02:21:30,950 --> 02:21:34,680
Hmm. Blood of my blood.

1424
02:21:41,190 --> 02:21:43,360
Born to destroy you.

1425
02:21:46,090 --> 02:21:48,160
Your Doomsday.

1426
02:22:11,280 --> 02:22:14,090
Now God is good

1427
02:22:14,620 --> 02:22:16,090
as dead.

1428
02:22:19,290 --> 02:22:20,590
Oh!

1429
02:23:39,710 --> 02:23:41,110
Potus joining.

1430
02:23:41,110 --> 02:23:42,470
Mr. President.

1431
02:23:42,480 --> 02:23:44,140
What the hell is it, Calvin?

1432
02:23:44,140 --> 02:23:45,810
These are live
images from the top

1433
02:23:45,810 --> 02:23:48,050
of the LexCorp tower
in downtown Metropolis.

1434
02:23:48,050 --> 02:23:49,880
Military aircraft
are on the scene.

1435
02:24:01,800 --> 02:24:03,760
Are you hurt, Ma'am? I'm okay.

1436
02:24:03,760 --> 02:24:05,500
Good. You're gonna
be all right, okay?

1437
02:24:15,310 --> 02:24:18,180
This thing emerged from
the Kryptonian crash site

1438
02:24:18,180 --> 02:24:19,980
just moments ago.

1439
02:24:19,980 --> 02:24:21,980
Thankfully though,
the work day is over

1440
02:24:21,980 --> 02:24:24,520
in the downtown
core. It's nearly empty.

1441
02:24:24,520 --> 02:24:28,250
Now military aircraft. Those
are apache helicopters.

1442
02:24:28,260 --> 02:24:30,760
They have now just
arrived. The images that...

1443
02:25:06,990 --> 02:25:10,200
We've, uh... We just lost
connection with Metropolis 8 news.

1444
02:25:10,200 --> 02:25:12,530
Now, it's not clear
what just happened.

1445
02:25:16,140 --> 02:25:17,700
What's happening there, Alfred?

1446
02:25:19,540 --> 02:25:21,510
How best to describe it?

1447
02:25:21,510 --> 02:25:23,410
Metropolis airspace
has been closed briefly.

1448
02:25:23,410 --> 02:25:24,980
Excuse me?

1449
02:25:24,980 --> 02:25:25,680
We kindly ask that
you stay in your seats.

1450
02:25:25,680 --> 02:25:27,050
Excuse me?

1451
02:25:27,050 --> 02:25:28,450
Miss Prince?

1452
02:25:42,900 --> 02:25:44,900
Sir. Look, they've
cleared the city.

1453
02:25:44,900 --> 02:25:46,570
Looks like he's
taking it into space.

1454
02:25:46,570 --> 02:25:48,400
We can go straight to
key red, Mr. President.

1455
02:25:48,400 --> 02:25:50,040
Not yet. Are you crazy?

1456
02:25:50,040 --> 02:25:51,340
They're high enough
that we can nuke 'em

1457
02:25:51,340 --> 02:25:52,700
with no casualties, sir.

1458
02:25:52,710 --> 02:25:55,640
One casualty,
Mr. President. Superman.

1459
02:25:58,210 --> 02:25:59,580
God have mercy on us all.

1460
02:26:05,920 --> 02:26:07,950
Key is hot. Key is hot.

1461
02:26:07,960 --> 02:26:09,990
Red birds are
armed to deploy, sir.

1462
02:26:11,260 --> 02:26:12,560
Fire at will.

1463
02:26:12,560 --> 02:26:14,590
Three, two, one...

1464
02:27:03,610 --> 02:27:04,910
Oh, God.

1465
02:27:27,130 --> 02:27:28,500
Projectile 1. Impact.

1466
02:27:28,500 --> 02:27:30,540
Stryker's island,
east of Metropolis.

1467
02:27:30,540 --> 02:27:31,840
That's uninhabited.

1468
02:27:31,840 --> 02:27:33,370
Projectile 2...

1469
02:27:38,950 --> 02:27:41,150
No apparent reentry.

1470
02:27:41,150 --> 02:27:43,110
Projectile 2?

1471
02:27:43,120 --> 02:27:48,950
Superman, Mr. President.
Projectile 2 was Superman.

1472
02:27:48,960 --> 02:27:50,260
Sir.

1473
02:27:50,960 --> 02:27:52,090
It's moving.

1474
02:28:33,530 --> 02:28:35,230
The shockwaves
are getting stronger.

1475
02:28:35,240 --> 02:28:38,400
Every time we hit it, we
make it more powerful.

1476
02:28:38,410 --> 02:28:41,070
We can't attack.

1477
02:28:41,070 --> 02:28:43,540
What are you saying, Calvin?

1478
02:28:43,540 --> 02:28:45,780
I'm saying it's unkillable.

1479
02:29:13,270 --> 02:29:15,610
Master Wayne, are
you receiving me?

1480
02:29:15,610 --> 02:29:16,780
Alfred.

1481
02:29:16,780 --> 02:29:18,610
It's Kryptonian.

1482
02:29:18,610 --> 02:29:21,310
Only kryptonite
weapons can kill it.

1483
02:29:21,320 --> 02:29:24,480
They might. If you had any left.

1484
02:29:24,480 --> 02:29:27,950
I got one round left.

1485
02:29:27,960 --> 02:29:32,120
The spear. Alfred, the
spear. It's pure kryptonite.

1486
02:29:32,130 --> 02:29:33,890
It's back in Gotham.

1487
02:29:33,890 --> 02:29:36,760
If I can penetrate the
skin, the spear will kill it.

1488
02:29:36,760 --> 02:29:38,430
It would in theory.

1489
02:29:38,430 --> 02:29:40,930
I've gotta get it to chase
me back to the city.

1490
02:29:40,930 --> 02:29:42,670
Back to the kryptonite.

1491
02:30:43,330 --> 02:30:44,930
Oh, shit.

1492
02:31:34,350 --> 02:31:36,410
Why did you bring
him back to the city?

1493
02:31:36,420 --> 02:31:37,920
The port is abandoned.

1494
02:31:37,920 --> 02:31:39,780
There's a weapon
here that can kill it.

1495
02:31:52,360 --> 02:31:53,630
Did you find the spear?

1496
02:31:54,600 --> 02:31:56,370
I've been a little busy.

1497
02:31:56,370 --> 02:31:59,670
This thing, this creature,
seems to feed on energy.

1498
02:32:01,740 --> 02:32:04,640
This thing is from
another world.

1499
02:32:05,310 --> 02:32:06,640
My world.

1500
02:32:06,650 --> 02:32:09,310
I've killed things from
other worlds before.

1501
02:32:10,950 --> 02:32:12,150
Is she with you?

1502
02:32:13,120 --> 02:32:15,020
I thought she was with you.

1503
02:35:53,470 --> 02:35:55,010
Clark!

1504
02:35:55,010 --> 02:35:56,370
Clark!

1505
02:36:03,850 --> 02:36:04,920
Clark!

1506
02:36:15,400 --> 02:36:17,300
Clark!

1507
02:36:17,300 --> 02:36:18,930
Clark! Are you all right?

1508
02:36:56,740 --> 02:36:58,470
I love you.

1509
02:37:02,070 --> 02:37:05,510
No. No, Clark, you can't.

1510
02:37:07,250 --> 02:37:09,180
This is my world.

1511
02:37:09,180 --> 02:37:10,650
No, Clark, don't.

1512
02:37:14,250 --> 02:37:16,620
You are my world.

1513
02:37:16,620 --> 02:37:17,760
No.

1514
02:37:20,930 --> 02:37:22,660
Please. Clark!

1515
02:44:28,620 --> 02:44:29,690
Hi.

1516
02:44:36,700 --> 02:44:39,430
Clark had this sent here,
so he could surprise you.

1517
02:47:06,510 --> 02:47:08,680
"The dead shall live.

1518
02:47:09,510 --> 02:47:12,750
"My slain shall rise again.

1519
02:47:15,720 --> 02:47:18,590
"Awake and sing,
ye that dwell in dust.

1520
02:47:20,030 --> 02:47:23,360
"For thy dew is like
the dew of morning.

1521
02:47:25,200 --> 02:47:30,130
"And the earth shall
give birth to her dead."

1522
02:47:37,540 --> 02:47:40,210
Ah, I need a ride
back to the house.

1523
02:47:40,210 --> 02:47:42,910
I forgot my checkbook
to pay the funeral director.

1524
02:47:42,920 --> 02:47:45,050
They said it's
all taken care of.

1525
02:47:45,050 --> 02:47:46,120
By whom?

1526
02:47:47,050 --> 02:47:48,790
Anonymous donor.

1527
02:48:32,600 --> 02:48:36,770
All those circuses back
east burying an empty box.

1528
02:48:36,770 --> 02:48:38,840
They don't know
how to honor him,

1529
02:48:39,870 --> 02:48:41,670
except as a soldier.

1530
02:48:43,440 --> 02:48:46,780
I've failed him in life.

1531
02:48:48,250 --> 02:48:52,050
I won't fail him in death.

1532
02:48:52,050 --> 02:48:54,720
Help me find the
others like you.

1533
02:48:54,720 --> 02:48:56,650
Perhaps they don't
want to be found.

1534
02:48:57,590 --> 02:49:00,390
They will. And they'll fight.

1535
02:49:01,590 --> 02:49:03,560
We have to stand together.

1536
02:49:11,300 --> 02:49:14,540
100 years ago, I walked
away from mankind.

1537
02:49:16,610 --> 02:49:18,580
From a century of horrors.

1538
02:49:22,150 --> 02:49:25,850
Man made a world where
standing together is impossible.

1539
02:49:28,920 --> 02:49:30,850
Men are still good.

1540
02:49:33,320 --> 02:49:36,230
We fight. We kill.

1541
02:49:37,430 --> 02:49:39,830
We betray one another.

1542
02:49:41,700 --> 02:49:43,770
But we can rebuild.

1543
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:46,870
We can do better.

1544
02:49:48,140 --> 02:49:50,170
We will.

1545
02:49:50,180 --> 02:49:51,380
We have to.

1546
02:50:14,470 --> 02:50:16,030
The others like me.

1547
02:50:16,040 --> 02:50:18,300
Why did you say
they'll have to fight?

1548
02:50:23,710 --> 02:50:25,940
Just a feeling.

1549
02:50:37,160 --> 02:50:39,760
Prisoner A-C-23-19-40.

1550
02:50:39,760 --> 02:50:42,490
The Warden wants to speak
to you, so stand to your feet.

1551
02:50:44,100 --> 02:50:46,000
I'm gonna say
this one more time.

1552
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:48,800
The Warden wants to speak
to you, so stand to your feet.

1553
02:50:56,670 --> 02:50:58,580
Turn around and face the wall.

1554
02:51:00,610 --> 02:51:03,010
Place your forehead
against the wall.

1555
02:51:03,020 --> 02:51:04,920
Put your hands behind your back,

1556
02:51:04,920 --> 02:51:06,980
so that I can come
in and restrain you.

1557
02:51:35,280 --> 02:51:38,220
Whatever you do,
wherever you go, 

1558
02:51:38,220 --> 02:51:40,320
I'll be watching you.

1559
02:51:40,950 --> 02:51:42,350
Oh...

1560
02:51:43,790 --> 02:51:45,360
Look at us.

1561
02:51:46,460 --> 02:51:48,760
This is how it all caves in.

1562
02:51:48,760 --> 02:51:54,160
Civilization on the Wayne
manor's out the window.

1563
02:51:54,170 --> 02:51:55,730
Mmm?

1564
02:51:58,240 --> 02:52:01,140
But who would believe me? I...

1565
02:52:01,140 --> 02:52:03,570
I'm insane.

1566
02:52:04,840 --> 02:52:07,010
I'm not even fit to stand trial.

1567
02:52:07,010 --> 02:52:08,950
That's right.

1568
02:52:08,950 --> 02:52:12,780
We have hospitals that treat
the mentally ill with compassion.

1569
02:52:14,090 --> 02:52:16,090
But that's not
where you're going.

1570
02:52:16,090 --> 02:52:19,590
I arranged for you to get transferred
to Arkham Asylum in Gotham.

1571
02:52:20,990 --> 02:52:23,530
I still have some friends there.

1572
02:52:23,530 --> 02:52:25,160
They're expecting you.

1573
02:52:29,670 --> 02:52:33,900
But the bell's
already been rung.

1574
02:52:36,370 --> 02:52:37,840
And they've heard it.

1575
02:52:39,680 --> 02:52:41,450
Out in the dark.

1576
02:52:41,450 --> 02:52:44,110
Among the stars. Hmm.

1577
02:52:47,190 --> 02:52:50,750
Ding dong, the God is dead.

1578
02:53:00,130 --> 02:53:02,930
But a bell cannot be unrung!

1579
02:53:04,240 --> 02:53:07,770
He's hungry. He's found us.

1580
02:53:08,970 --> 02:53:10,740
And he's coming!

1581
02:53:13,880 --> 02:53:16,450
Ding, ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

1582
02:53:18,650 --> 02:53:21,620
Ding, ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

1583
02:53:23,490 --> 02:53:26,790
Ding, ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

1584
02:53:28,090 --> 02:53:31,130
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

1585
02:53:33,160 --> 02:53:37,930
Ding, ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

1586
02:53:37,940 --> 02:53:41,100
Ding, ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
