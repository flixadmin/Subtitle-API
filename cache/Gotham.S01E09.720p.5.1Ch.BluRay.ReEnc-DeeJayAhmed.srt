create chaos. I need to siphon his strength.

No ID.

But this is from an eyewitness

It's not enough to go to the law with.

I agree.
Your eyewitness is useless in a courtroom.

But the idea of your witness
could be immensely valuable.

Ever hear the name Dick Lovecraft?

As corrupt as they come.

Lovecraft has dealings with all of them.

Since the Waynes' deaths, he's doubled his
fortune, including a piece of the Arkham deal.

with Thomas Wayne over deals and politics.

They couldn't have had

That's a big bet.

I want to use your witness
to go after Lovecraft.

133
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,644
How? My witness can't connect
Lovecraft to the perp.

134
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,761
Lovecraft doesn't know that.

135
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,525
I'll let it leak out...

136

...that we have a secret eyewitness
who's going to blow the case wide open...

137
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,568
...and connect Lovecraft
to the Wayne killings.

138
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,086
Lovecraft will get very nervous.

139
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:39,649
The people around him will get nervous.
And that's when people start talking.

Unless Lovecraft wasn't involved.

If so, which I doubt, we still win.

That's the beauty of it. We never file papers.
We never name names.

You tell me, detective.
How is this my fault?

389

For starters, you have the mentally ill
housed at Blackgate.

That'll help.
