1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,761
My brother sends his
apologies for not being here

2
00:00:03,881 --> 00:00:05,601
and would like to invite
all of you to his home

3
00:00:05,721 --> 00:00:06,921
for a meeting.

4
00:00:07,041 --> 00:00:08,921
All you have to do
is sit with Jack Nelson

5
00:00:09,041 --> 00:00:11,001
and talk to him about
a new golden age.

6
00:00:11,121 --> 00:00:12,561
If anyone's
going to kill Tommy Shelby...

7
00:00:12,681 --> 00:00:15,721
It will be you.
The future belongs to us.

8
00:00:15,841 --> 00:00:17,241
Your daughter has consumption.

9
00:00:17,361 --> 00:00:19,681
Consumption is
a very infectious disease.

10
00:00:19,801 --> 00:00:21,801
<i>While they're X-raying
Ruby, they have to X-ray us.</i>

11
00:00:21,921 --> 00:00:23,721
It'll be the girl's mother
who laid the curse.

12
00:00:23,841 --> 00:00:25,921
<i>Perhaps she waited
till your little girl was seven</i>

13
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:27,361
<i>so you'd know how it feels.</i>

14
00:00:27,481 --> 00:00:29,881
Now that I'm without whisky,
I can hear the spirits clearly,

15
00:00:30,001 --> 00:00:32,321
and they are saying that Ruby
will be well if I make amends.

16
00:00:32,441 --> 00:00:33,521
She's gone, Tommy.

17
00:03:24,721 --> 00:03:26,201
Arthur?

18
00:03:28,881 --> 00:03:30,361
I've written some words.

19
00:03:32,441 --> 00:03:33,801
I can't speak 'em.

20
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:38,001
- You're the oldest.

21
00:03:38,121 --> 00:03:40,641
- You speak 'em for me.

22
00:03:48,681 --> 00:03:50,481
I'm sorry, Brother.

23
00:03:50,601 --> 00:03:52,321
I can't do it.

24
00:04:22,761 --> 00:04:25,121
We could have afforded
a golden carriage.

25
00:04:29,721 --> 00:04:31,561
She deserved a golden carriage.

26
00:04:36,241 --> 00:04:38,521
But we didn't afford ourselves
that luxury...

27
00:04:42,201 --> 00:04:43,961
...because gold doesn't work.

28
00:04:49,801 --> 00:04:52,321
That was the last lesson
that Ruby taught us.

29
00:05:07,961 --> 00:05:12,881
This place was her favourite
place in the whole world.

30
00:05:13,001 --> 00:05:14,121
And she used to say...

31
00:05:15,721 --> 00:05:16,921
..."Dad...

32
00:05:19,801 --> 00:05:22,921
..."you never know what's
going to come down the river."

33
00:05:24,361 --> 00:05:26,081
And it's true...

34
00:05:27,921 --> 00:05:29,241
...cos little Ruby's fate...

35
00:05:30,281 --> 00:05:32,241
...came a thousand miles
too soon.

36
00:05:36,641 --> 00:05:41,201
But in her name and in her
memory, things will change.

37
00:05:44,121 --> 00:05:47,401
And whatever comes
down that river from now on...

38
00:05:47,521 --> 00:05:49,121
...we will make good...

39
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:54,841
....we will make peaceful
and honest and good

40
00:05:54,961 --> 00:05:57,161
and send it on down the river
better than it was.

41
00:05:57,281 --> 00:05:59,401
In her memory we will do this.

42
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:10,721
But for now, we send her on...

43
00:06:12,321 --> 00:06:13,801
...to wherever it is you go...

44
00:06:15,961 --> 00:06:18,601
...in the hope that
if there is a destination...

45
00:06:20,841 --> 00:06:22,961
...that it's a yard like this,

46
00:06:23,081 --> 00:06:26,721
with horses
and boats for her to play on.

47
00:06:39,601 --> 00:06:40,681
Tom?

48
00:06:41,681 --> 00:06:44,361
- I've got the petrol.

49
00:06:44,481 --> 00:06:46,081
Who will light the flame?

50
00:06:51,481 --> 00:06:52,801
Jeremiah?

51
00:06:59,281 --> 00:07:01,921
Jeremiah, you made her laugh.

52
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:04,201
You light the flame.

53
00:07:04,321 --> 00:07:06,521
No, no!

54
00:07:06,641 --> 00:07:07,921
- No!
- Lizzie, Lizzie...

55
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:10,721
No, you won't burn her! No!

56
00:07:10,841 --> 00:07:12,081
Shh, shh, shh, shh...

57
00:07:15,361 --> 00:07:18,201
I just want to see her.
I just want to see her face.

58
00:07:18,321 --> 00:07:20,001
We'll go and see her together.
Come on.

59
00:07:20,121 --> 00:07:21,521
We'll go and see her together.

60
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:22,561
Yeah.

61
00:07:34,561 --> 00:07:37,361
Oh, my baby.

62
00:07:56,001 --> 00:07:58,801
The devils who did this
will pay, Ruby.

63
00:08:02,361 --> 00:08:04,081
What do you mean?

64
00:08:07,281 --> 00:08:08,881
What do you mean?

65
00:08:10,121 --> 00:08:12,241
Where are you going, Tommy?

66
00:10:03,841 --> 00:10:07,601
Riley! I think
the police are here.

67
00:10:09,441 --> 00:10:11,321
Evadne Barwell?

68
00:10:11,441 --> 00:10:14,521
Yeah. Who's asking?

69
00:10:16,201 --> 00:10:18,001
I am here on behalf
of the blue sapphire.

70
00:10:28,641 --> 00:10:30,681
Don't shoot! There are babies!

71
00:10:30,801 --> 00:10:33,201
- BABY CRIES)

72
00:12:59,961 --> 00:13:01,321
Gold dust.

73
00:13:02,321 --> 00:13:04,321
Our business is done, Esme.

74
00:13:04,441 --> 00:13:05,841
Get out of the car.

75
00:13:05,961 --> 00:13:07,161
Not quite done, Tommy.

76
00:13:08,361 --> 00:13:10,201
I thought this would be
a good time.

77
00:13:10,321 --> 00:13:12,081
In fact, it's the perfect time.

78
00:13:13,321 --> 00:13:15,441
Some business
is still unfinished.

79
00:13:17,241 --> 00:13:20,561
Christians say, "The Lord
gives, the Lord takes away."

80
00:13:20,681 --> 00:13:22,081
Our spirits are the same.

81
00:13:23,081 --> 00:13:25,081
Spirits just took away
your child.

82
00:13:25,201 --> 00:13:27,281
- Get out of the car, Esme.

83
00:13:27,401 --> 00:13:30,001
The same spirits want to give
you a different child, Tommy.

84
00:13:30,121 --> 00:13:33,121
What child?

85
00:13:34,721 --> 00:13:36,281
A daughter lost...

86
00:13:37,281 --> 00:13:38,721
...a son found.

87
00:13:41,241 --> 00:13:44,521
Before you went to France, a
long time ago, at Appleby Fair,

88
00:13:44,641 --> 00:13:46,321
you slept with a girl.

89
00:13:46,441 --> 00:13:48,921
Her name was Zelda. I met her.

90
00:13:50,481 --> 00:13:54,161
She said you slept together
under a hazel tree in May 1914.

91
00:13:55,801 --> 00:14:00,321
When she fell pregnant, her
father threatened to kill you,

92
00:14:00,441 --> 00:14:04,321
but you'd already joined the
Army and gone away to France.

93
00:14:07,001 --> 00:14:10,081
You remember the girl and the
hazel tree, don't you, Tommy?

94
00:14:13,921 --> 00:14:16,561
Whoever that boy is, Esme...

95
00:14:17,881 --> 00:14:19,641
...whoever he is,
our business is done here.

96
00:14:19,761 --> 00:14:21,481
I brought you to this camp
for a reason,

97
00:14:21,601 --> 00:14:24,161
and I brought him, as well.

98
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:25,961
He is yours.

99
00:14:26,081 --> 00:14:28,401
A boy born with hazel eyes.

100
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:30,961
He calls himself Duke.

101
00:14:32,881 --> 00:14:33,921
His mother is dead.

102
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,921
He's a thief.

103
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,761
He works the fairground,
but he says he wants

104
00:14:37,881 --> 00:14:40,601
more to his life than
big wheels and carousels.

105
00:14:44,241 --> 00:14:47,161
If the losing of Ruby has left
a hole in your heart...

106
00:14:48,401 --> 00:14:50,241
...I'll send him to you.

107
00:14:51,761 --> 00:14:53,521
If you give me
a bit more gold...

108
00:14:55,281 --> 00:14:58,081
...I'll tell him Tommy Shelby
can offer a man

109
00:14:58,201 --> 00:15:01,441
far, far more than big wheels
and carousels.

110
00:15:03,641 --> 00:15:05,601
Is our business done
or not, Tommy?

111
00:15:33,201 --> 00:15:35,361
I know where you went.

112
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:50,241
I'm going to spend more hours

113
00:15:50,361 --> 00:15:52,161
working in the Commons
with Mr Churchill.

114
00:15:52,281 --> 00:15:54,041
- His fight is my fight.
- I sat like a stone

115
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,081
and thought about you
killing someone in her name.

116
00:15:56,201 --> 00:15:58,161
The Shelby institutions
will be expanded.

117
00:16:00,281 --> 00:16:02,001
I will set up a fund
to research the causes

118
00:16:02,121 --> 00:16:03,161
and cures for consumption.

119
00:16:03,281 --> 00:16:05,201
Did the woman you killed
have children?

120
00:16:05,321 --> 00:16:07,281
10,000 children die
every year, Lizzie.

121
00:16:07,401 --> 00:16:09,121
- Go to bed, Tommy.
- I've been reading

122
00:16:09,241 --> 00:16:11,081
- about new research.
- Stop and close

123
00:16:11,201 --> 00:16:12,641
- your fucking eyes.
- I will not...

124
00:16:12,761 --> 00:16:14,001
I will not stop!

125
00:16:14,121 --> 00:16:16,641
What is this good
that you will become?!

126
00:16:27,161 --> 00:16:28,561
I killed a woman.

127
00:16:29,841 --> 00:16:31,601
I killed a woman and three men.

128
00:16:31,721 --> 00:16:34,441
And their bodies will be
thrown aboard the boat,

129
00:16:34,561 --> 00:16:35,881
like all the other bodies,

130
00:16:36,001 --> 00:16:38,681
but I am stepping off that boat
and onto another boat.

131
00:16:40,201 --> 00:16:41,761
Do you understand?!

132
00:16:44,601 --> 00:16:45,801
Yeah.

133
00:16:57,481 --> 00:16:59,561
The doctor
from the sanatorium called

134
00:16:59,681 --> 00:17:02,121
and said that he needs
to speak with you urgently.

135
00:17:03,881 --> 00:17:06,241
But I think now you are
beyond the help of doctors.

136
00:17:06,361 --> 00:17:07,681
Lizzie...

137
00:17:10,481 --> 00:17:12,241
Frances said Arthur's here.

138
00:17:44,961 --> 00:17:46,361
Tommy?

139
00:17:47,921 --> 00:17:49,761
- Tom?
- Yeah, it's me.

140
00:17:50,921 --> 00:17:52,121
Ah, fuck.

141
00:18:11,721 --> 00:18:13,521
Arthur, give me a light,
will you?

142
00:18:14,521 --> 00:18:15,881
I can't find my lighter.

143
00:18:28,401 --> 00:18:31,241
I'm sorry I couldn't speak
at the wagon, Tom.

144
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:42,521
Don't be sorry.

145
00:18:45,081 --> 00:18:47,001
What are you doing here?

146
00:18:50,241 --> 00:18:52,801
Waiting for this fucking cup
to fill up.

147
00:18:57,161 --> 00:18:58,721
Nearly empty, this barrel.

148
00:19:00,281 --> 00:19:02,361
There are plenty
of barrels, Arthur.

149
00:19:03,481 --> 00:19:05,361
Start another barrel.

150
00:19:05,481 --> 00:19:08,321
I thought maybe they're all
full of fucking blood.

151
00:19:12,081 --> 00:19:13,561
The junk, Tom...

152
00:19:15,761 --> 00:19:17,161
...fucks up your mind.

153
00:19:21,681 --> 00:19:23,361
You know, Arthur...

154
00:19:25,561 --> 00:19:27,801
...you was already fucked up.

155
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:32,241
You was fucked up
since you was a kid.

156
00:19:34,441 --> 00:19:35,561
This is my theory.

157
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:42,041
It's from that time
I gave you a beating

158
00:19:42,161 --> 00:19:44,041
when you was twelve
and I was nine.

159
00:19:45,521 --> 00:19:47,481
We were fighting
over cigarettes.

160
00:19:49,881 --> 00:19:54,441
Maybe...when I had you
down on the ground...

161
00:19:55,441 --> 00:19:57,841
...I gave you one too many
to the head.

162
00:19:57,961 --> 00:20:00,361
It was a draw, though, Tom.

163
00:20:00,481 --> 00:20:01,841
Nah.

164
00:20:02,881 --> 00:20:04,201
I beat you.

165
00:20:05,201 --> 00:20:06,881
I had you pinned.

166
00:20:07,001 --> 00:20:08,601
You actually didn't.

167
00:20:10,561 --> 00:20:12,561
- We both agreed.
- You're so fucked

168
00:20:12,681 --> 00:20:14,721
you can't remember, Brother.

169
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:17,881
I do.

170
00:20:18,001 --> 00:20:20,161
I do remember little things.

171
00:20:20,281 --> 00:20:21,601
I know you do.

172
00:20:22,601 --> 00:20:24,481
So do I.

173
00:20:24,601 --> 00:20:26,641
The fog and the gas
is clearing, eh?

174
00:21:18,961 --> 00:21:21,241
Here, that cup's nearly full.
Pass it here.

175
00:21:25,641 --> 00:21:26,961
I thought you...

176
00:21:29,601 --> 00:21:31,481
Tom, you don't want
stuff any more.

177
00:21:31,601 --> 00:21:33,081
Eh?

178
00:21:34,081 --> 00:21:35,761
You don't drink no more, Tom.

179
00:21:59,601 --> 00:22:01,841
Even when Polly was gone,
Arthur...

180
00:22:03,201 --> 00:22:04,721
...I thought I could just march
and march.

181
00:22:06,601 --> 00:22:09,081
If I just kept up that fucking
left, right, left, right,

182
00:22:09,201 --> 00:22:12,041
left, right, left, right
fucking rhythm,

183
00:22:12,161 --> 00:22:14,201
I'd never have to stop.

184
00:22:16,321 --> 00:22:17,921
Then Ruby went.

185
00:22:21,801 --> 00:22:23,641
I stumbled and crashed.

186
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:30,681
Now here I am...

187
00:22:32,361 --> 00:22:34,801
...sat on me arse...

188
00:22:34,921 --> 00:22:37,321
...on the ground...

189
00:22:37,441 --> 00:22:39,401
...like a fucking toddler...

190
00:22:41,801 --> 00:22:43,721
...with me old comrade Arthur.

191
00:22:44,841 --> 00:22:46,201
Yeah.

192
00:22:48,641 --> 00:22:50,521
Remember the January, Arthur?

193
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:54,441
The family boat?

194
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,721
The whole family
living on something

195
00:22:57,841 --> 00:23:00,121
the size of ten of
these fucking barrels?

196
00:23:03,801 --> 00:23:07,841
Remember that night
at Tile Cross...

197
00:23:07,961 --> 00:23:10,361
...16 of us
sleeping on the boat?

198
00:23:10,481 --> 00:23:11,721
The coppers come.

199
00:23:12,721 --> 00:23:15,041
We all swim like rats.

200
00:23:15,161 --> 00:23:16,601
Except for Arthur.

201
00:23:17,601 --> 00:23:22,001
Arthur holds them off with
a boathook all on his own.

202
00:23:23,801 --> 00:23:25,121
And I remember...

203
00:23:26,121 --> 00:23:28,641
...I climbed back up
at the lock and I looked back

204
00:23:28,761 --> 00:23:31,401
and saw you waving
that fucking boathook

205
00:23:31,521 --> 00:23:32,721
in the coppers' faces...

206
00:23:34,641 --> 00:23:35,881
...on your own.

207
00:23:37,321 --> 00:23:38,721
That's when I realised.

208
00:23:40,841 --> 00:23:42,361
When I had you on the ground...

209
00:23:43,401 --> 00:23:45,241
...all them years ago...

210
00:23:45,361 --> 00:23:47,401
...it's cos you let me win.

211
00:23:51,161 --> 00:23:52,681
You wanted me to win.

212
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:59,361
You've wanted me to win
ever since.

213
00:24:01,081 --> 00:24:03,201
What chance do I have if you...

214
00:24:04,841 --> 00:24:08,001
...start doing that again? Eh?

215
00:24:09,761 --> 00:24:13,521
You'll stop. You'll stop
cos the family needs you to.

216
00:24:16,081 --> 00:24:19,801
It's like that long tunnel
on the Dudley stretch.

217
00:24:19,921 --> 00:24:21,681
You remember Dudley Canal,
Line Number 1?

218
00:24:21,801 --> 00:24:23,921
3,172 yards

219
00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:26,641
of fucking pitch-blackness
and rats swimming.

220
00:24:26,761 --> 00:24:27,881
- Yeah.
- And then we'd come

221
00:24:28,001 --> 00:24:31,001
round that corner and
there'd be a shaft of light.

222
00:24:32,001 --> 00:24:33,801
And then we'd know.

223
00:24:33,921 --> 00:24:35,241
- Yeah.
- And you and me

224
00:24:35,361 --> 00:24:37,321
would both know
it was nearly done.

225
00:24:40,201 --> 00:24:42,441
That's where
we are now, Arthur.

226
00:24:44,401 --> 00:24:46,721
Just a few more yards to go.

227
00:24:48,561 --> 00:24:50,481
Then you will change your ways.

228
00:24:53,761 --> 00:24:55,841
And I'll change
the fucking world.

229
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:16,001
We assumed, at this late hour,
you would have had dinner.

230
00:26:16,121 --> 00:26:18,161
There are drinks
and sandwiches, if you want.

231
00:26:18,281 --> 00:26:19,481
We're not here to eat.

232
00:26:19,601 --> 00:26:22,881
Mr Shelby will be down shortly.

233
00:26:23,001 --> 00:26:24,841
Please, tell Mr Shelby
on behalf of us all

234
00:26:24,961 --> 00:26:26,241
that changing the world
can wait.

235
00:26:26,361 --> 00:26:28,001
He doesn't want to wait.

236
00:26:28,121 --> 00:26:29,361
There is champagne.

237
00:26:29,481 --> 00:26:31,201
Oh, goodie.

238
00:26:41,681 --> 00:26:43,081
Charles?

239
00:26:45,241 --> 00:26:46,801
I heard cars.

240
00:26:51,121 --> 00:26:52,641
Mr Shelby, the guests are...

241
00:26:52,761 --> 00:26:54,161
I know.

242
00:26:55,321 --> 00:26:56,521
Dad?

243
00:26:56,641 --> 00:26:58,521
There's a Bentley
and a Rolls-Royce.

244
00:27:01,761 --> 00:27:02,761
Yeah.

245
00:27:04,961 --> 00:27:06,681
Go to bed, Charles.

246
00:27:14,001 --> 00:27:15,761
I can't sleep.

247
00:27:19,241 --> 00:27:21,641
I see her when I shut my eyes.

248
00:27:22,921 --> 00:27:24,721
Go to your mum.

249
00:27:24,841 --> 00:27:26,841
She'll be awake.

250
00:27:26,961 --> 00:27:29,641
- She holds on to me.
- Let her hold on to you.

251
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:33,401
You hear me?

252
00:27:33,521 --> 00:27:35,121
Always let her hold on to you.

253
00:27:36,521 --> 00:27:37,881
Go on.

254
00:27:42,401 --> 00:27:45,041
Mr Shelby, the guests said
they would understand if...

255
00:27:45,161 --> 00:27:46,361
Have you served them drinks?

256
00:27:46,481 --> 00:27:48,481
- Yes.
- Yeah.

257
00:28:01,321 --> 00:28:02,721
I'm OK, Frances.

258
00:28:08,001 --> 00:28:09,601
The agenda is in my head.

259
00:28:11,001 --> 00:28:12,921
The agenda is in my head.

260
00:28:14,121 --> 00:28:15,641
I'm OK.

261
00:28:16,641 --> 00:28:18,161
Do I look OK?

262
00:28:21,441 --> 00:28:23,881
If someone touches you,
you won't shatter.

263
00:28:26,401 --> 00:28:28,361
Sing it.

264
00:28:28,481 --> 00:28:30,321
Sing it. I love that song.

265
00:28:30,441 --> 00:28:33,241
I...can't be singing
rebel songs

266
00:28:33,361 --> 00:28:34,761
in a house
in grief and mourning.

267
00:28:34,881 --> 00:28:37,921
Sing it to me softly.
It breaks my heart.

268
00:28:39,481 --> 00:28:41,321
Don't look at him.
He's English.

269
00:28:41,441 --> 00:28:43,401
He can block his ears.

270
00:28:46,441 --> 00:28:47,361
Darling?

271
00:28:47,481 --> 00:28:50,881
Should she sing her rebel
IRA song while we wait,

272
00:28:51,001 --> 00:28:52,961
or would that be inappropriate?

273
00:28:56,641 --> 00:28:57,761
You know, I went to a meeting

274
00:28:57,881 --> 00:28:59,361
of similar intent to this
in Berlin

275
00:28:59,481 --> 00:29:02,601
attended by
the Chancellor himself...

276
00:29:02,721 --> 00:29:05,801
..and Göring and Himmler.

277
00:29:07,121 --> 00:29:08,601
It lasted until
the sun came up.

278
00:29:08,721 --> 00:29:13,121
We spoke about the future
of the world in a serious way.

279
00:29:15,161 --> 00:29:17,881
When the first rays of light
entered the room, we all stood

280
00:29:18,001 --> 00:29:20,641
and stared at it as if it were
the world to come.

281
00:29:21,961 --> 00:29:24,521
There was no singing,
no giggling.

282
00:29:27,441 --> 00:29:29,481
And when breakfast was served
on the terrace,

283
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,121
overlooking the mountains,

284
00:29:31,241 --> 00:29:32,881
they brought up some Jews.

285
00:29:34,801 --> 00:29:37,921
And while we ate our eggs,
they were forced to eat grass.

286
00:29:39,481 --> 00:29:42,441
And we watched
as we sipped our coffee.

287
00:29:48,441 --> 00:29:51,201
We should all remember
this is serious business.

288
00:30:00,401 --> 00:30:01,761
Oh, Diana.

289
00:30:03,921 --> 00:30:06,761
Now look what you've done.
You've killed the mood.

290
00:30:11,841 --> 00:30:13,921
Let her sing her fucking song
to raise our spirits.

291
00:30:14,041 --> 00:30:15,801
Go on. Please.

292
00:30:25,001 --> 00:30:29,441
# In a neat little town
they call Belfast

293
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:33,521
# Apprentice to trade
I was bound

294
00:30:33,641 --> 00:30:38,401
# And many's an hour's
sweet happiness

295
00:30:38,521 --> 00:30:42,241
# Have I spent
in that neat little town

296
00:30:42,361 --> 00:30:45,441
# A sad misfortune
came over me... #

297
00:31:07,761 --> 00:31:10,241
Did it break?

298
00:31:10,361 --> 00:31:11,521
Mum will fix it for you.

299
00:33:28,201 --> 00:33:30,241
She's not here any more.

300
00:33:42,041 --> 00:33:45,801
# Her eyes, they shone
like diamonds

301
00:33:45,921 --> 00:33:47,961
# I thought her the Queen... #

302
00:33:48,081 --> 00:33:49,161
Mr Shelby...

303
00:33:49,281 --> 00:33:52,441
No, please, no condolences.
Thank you all for coming.

304
00:33:54,081 --> 00:33:55,121
Now, let's try to find out

305
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:57,801
how this new world of ours
will look, shall we?

306
00:34:04,721 --> 00:34:06,521
Perhaps, Mr Mosley, we can turn

307
00:34:06,641 --> 00:34:08,521
to what practical things
Mr Nelson can do

308
00:34:08,641 --> 00:34:11,481
to...further our cause
while he's in the country.

309
00:34:11,601 --> 00:34:14,961
It's me who has the ear of the
President of the United States.

310
00:34:15,081 --> 00:34:18,121
Which is kind of
why I'm here, right?

311
00:34:18,241 --> 00:34:19,561
We do indeed have things

312
00:34:19,681 --> 00:34:22,241
for you to whisper
into the President's ear.

313
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:28,001
Tell him we are England.
We are the mood England is in.

314
00:34:28,121 --> 00:34:32,401
And in Ireland, appeasers
to the English abound,

315
00:34:32,521 --> 00:34:35,281
but we represent
the true, liberated spirit

316
00:34:35,401 --> 00:34:38,081
of the country that populated
your own.

317
00:34:40,401 --> 00:34:43,281
I hear about communists
in both places.

318
00:34:43,401 --> 00:34:45,361
We are the bulwark
against them.

319
00:34:46,601 --> 00:34:49,321
When it comes
to the working class,

320
00:34:49,441 --> 00:34:52,481
we could move our people
from republicanism

321
00:34:52,601 --> 00:34:54,841
to fascism with just a nudge.

322
00:34:56,201 --> 00:34:57,281
They trust us.

323
00:34:58,601 --> 00:35:01,281
You ride with hounds,
Mr Mosley.

324
00:35:01,401 --> 00:35:02,801
Will you hunt communists?

325
00:35:02,921 --> 00:35:06,241
Oh, my hounds are baying.

326
00:35:06,361 --> 00:35:07,881
Shelby...

327
00:35:08,001 --> 00:35:09,641
...you run as a socialist.

328
00:35:17,161 --> 00:35:18,641
Mr Shelby has one of

329
00:35:18,761 --> 00:35:21,761
the largest Commons majorities
in England.

330
00:35:21,881 --> 00:35:24,281
In the heart of England.

331
00:35:25,281 --> 00:35:27,561
When the time comes,
he'll resign his party whip

332
00:35:27,681 --> 00:35:29,401
and run as an independent.

333
00:35:33,561 --> 00:35:35,121
But underneath, do you truly

334
00:35:35,241 --> 00:35:36,721
believe in the cause,
Mr Shelby?

335
00:35:48,241 --> 00:35:49,881
I'm here.

336
00:35:50,001 --> 00:35:52,121
Mr Nelson,
I'm here four nights...

337
00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:01,121
...four nights after,
and I am here...

338
00:36:02,601 --> 00:36:04,601
...in this room,
in this meeting.

339
00:36:04,721 --> 00:36:06,321
I am here and I am serious.

340
00:36:09,201 --> 00:36:10,761
Prove it to him.

341
00:36:14,801 --> 00:36:16,481
Prove it physically.

342
00:36:28,401 --> 00:36:30,241
Perish Judah.

343
00:36:37,641 --> 00:36:39,521
Perish Judah.

344
00:36:46,481 --> 00:36:48,121
That thing is going to
get us killed.

345
00:36:51,641 --> 00:36:52,881
Go to bed.

346
00:36:54,241 --> 00:36:57,241
At school, they've stopped
talking to me.

347
00:37:01,401 --> 00:37:03,521
They say the black rubs off.

348
00:37:06,161 --> 00:37:08,081
When they come to power...

349
00:37:08,201 --> 00:37:09,801
...they'll take her off you.

350
00:37:11,041 --> 00:37:12,841
They're going to
separate us all out.

351
00:37:14,961 --> 00:37:16,921
They'll send her to Africa.

352
00:37:18,721 --> 00:37:19,881
Yeah?

353
00:37:20,881 --> 00:37:22,481
And where will they send you?

354
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:25,561
Where will they send you, Karl?

355
00:37:26,641 --> 00:37:29,001
You're half Gypsy, so...

356
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:30,681
...to Egypt, maybe?

357
00:37:35,841 --> 00:37:38,401
Something I never
told you before...

358
00:37:38,521 --> 00:37:40,241
...because it wasn't important.

359
00:37:41,881 --> 00:37:43,361
Maybe now it is.

360
00:37:44,801 --> 00:37:46,401
Your dad was Jewish.

361
00:37:48,441 --> 00:37:51,561
He was the son
of a tailor in Stechford.

362
00:37:51,681 --> 00:37:53,161
They changed their name
to Thorne

363
00:37:53,281 --> 00:37:55,841
to stop the bricks
coming through the window.

364
00:37:57,761 --> 00:37:59,681
So where will they send you,
Karl?

365
00:38:03,041 --> 00:38:06,481
Mr Nelson, you can report back
to your president

366
00:38:06,601 --> 00:38:09,401
that the aristocracy
and the meritocracy are united

367
00:38:09,521 --> 00:38:12,521
in their conviction
that a new order is coming.

368
00:38:14,601 --> 00:38:16,641
Also, Mr Nelson, at present

369
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:19,241
our weapons are coming
from Germany.

370
00:38:19,361 --> 00:38:21,481
The British are closing
our supply lines down.

371
00:38:21,601 --> 00:38:23,961
We would value
a supply from Boston.

372
00:38:25,361 --> 00:38:26,521
Weapons I can give you,

373
00:38:26,641 --> 00:38:28,721
if they're to be used
in a good cause.

374
00:38:28,841 --> 00:38:31,721
And while on the subject
of import and export,

375
00:38:31,841 --> 00:38:33,081
Mr Shelby,

376
00:38:33,201 --> 00:38:35,361
in light of
our new relationship

377
00:38:35,481 --> 00:38:37,521
and since you have
proven your commitment

378
00:38:37,641 --> 00:38:39,321
in a most extraordinary way...

379
00:38:40,321 --> 00:38:42,241
...Boston is now
officially open

380
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:44,721
for the importation
of your merchandise.

381
00:38:50,561 --> 00:38:51,721
Good.

382
00:39:32,441 --> 00:39:35,441
If we have established
what we came here to establish,

383
00:39:35,561 --> 00:39:37,401
perhaps we should all
say goodnight.

384
00:39:37,521 --> 00:39:38,641
Absolutely.

385
00:40:26,561 --> 00:40:28,001
That's the same typewriter
you bought me

386
00:40:28,121 --> 00:40:29,481
all those years ago...

387
00:40:30,961 --> 00:40:33,681
...to help me become
more respectable.

388
00:40:33,801 --> 00:40:35,241
Do you remember?

389
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:38,161
Yeah.

390
00:40:45,041 --> 00:40:46,441
This arrived.

391
00:40:47,441 --> 00:40:48,961
It's from the sanatorium.

392
00:40:50,561 --> 00:40:52,921
I've already paid
Ruby's medical bills.

393
00:40:53,041 --> 00:40:55,641
I don't think it's a bill.

394
00:40:55,761 --> 00:40:57,121
It says it's urgent.

395
00:40:57,241 --> 00:40:59,881
It's from
the senior consultant.

396
00:41:18,121 --> 00:41:19,881
Why didn't you come to bed?

397
00:41:25,041 --> 00:41:26,841
Why didn't you come to bed?

398
00:41:32,441 --> 00:41:34,721
I'm typing up
my recollection of the meeting.

399
00:41:36,321 --> 00:41:38,521
If I... If I do it
straight away...

400
00:41:39,521 --> 00:41:41,841
...I can quote people
word for word.

401
00:41:42,961 --> 00:41:44,961
The information is more...

402
00:41:45,081 --> 00:41:46,241
...useful to Mr Churchill

403
00:41:46,361 --> 00:41:47,921
if it is word for word.

404
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:16,321
I burned her chair.

405
00:42:19,001 --> 00:42:21,161
The paint on the wood
left a smell in the air.

406
00:42:22,161 --> 00:42:24,041
I didn't open the window.

407
00:42:26,681 --> 00:42:28,241
I quite like the smell.

408
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:55,561
Not yet.

409
00:42:58,241 --> 00:42:59,921
Not yet.

410
00:43:02,241 --> 00:43:04,241
I have this work to do,
cos now I know...

411
00:43:05,241 --> 00:43:06,961
...that I will change...

412
00:43:09,001 --> 00:43:10,681
...that I have to change.

413
00:43:12,241 --> 00:43:14,881
And change for good, Lizzie.

414
00:43:20,481 --> 00:43:22,241
Not just yet.

415
00:43:53,481 --> 00:43:54,841
Hello?

416
00:43:58,681 --> 00:43:59,841
Oh.

417
00:45:14,801 --> 00:45:16,361
I saw him leave.

418
00:45:17,841 --> 00:45:19,001
He keeps this apartment

419
00:45:19,121 --> 00:45:21,721
expressly for this purpose,
doesn't he?

420
00:45:22,921 --> 00:45:25,281
Are you following me,
Mr Shelby?

421
00:45:26,401 --> 00:45:28,161
I'm flattered...

422
00:45:28,281 --> 00:45:30,121
...but why?

423
00:45:30,241 --> 00:45:31,961
When I do business
with someone,

424
00:45:32,081 --> 00:45:34,681
I make it <i>my</i> business
to know their secrets.

425
00:45:37,361 --> 00:45:39,361
Mosley's reputation
is no secret.

426
00:45:40,401 --> 00:45:42,081
Not him, you.

427
00:45:44,881 --> 00:45:46,361
How did you know I'd come here?

428
00:45:47,361 --> 00:45:49,521
I know things.

429
00:45:49,641 --> 00:45:51,961
I read people's minds,
you know?

430
00:45:54,241 --> 00:45:57,961
Little glances across tables.
It's a gift.

431
00:45:58,081 --> 00:45:59,241
The whole family...

432
00:46:00,241 --> 00:46:01,961
...witches and sorcerers.

433
00:46:11,321 --> 00:46:13,561
Your uncle will disown you...

434
00:46:13,681 --> 00:46:15,681
...fucking his business partner

435
00:46:15,801 --> 00:46:17,561
- behind his back.

436
00:46:17,681 --> 00:46:20,881
- You think he has morals?
- He's a Catholic.

437
00:46:21,001 --> 00:46:23,521
Men do what they want,
women do what they are told.

438
00:46:25,841 --> 00:46:27,281
Will you tell Michael?

439
00:46:28,601 --> 00:46:29,881
Michael is family.

440
00:46:31,241 --> 00:46:33,641
We are a family healed.

441
00:46:34,841 --> 00:46:37,041
You have no interest in me...

442
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:38,761
...or in Michael...

443
00:46:40,201 --> 00:46:43,001
...so why don't you just tell
me what you actually want?

444
00:46:54,801 --> 00:46:56,601
You will be with Mosley...

445
00:46:57,601 --> 00:47:00,001
...when he's in Berlin.

446
00:47:00,121 --> 00:47:01,521
You'll be in the room
when he meets

447
00:47:01,641 --> 00:47:04,001
senior members
of the German government.

448
00:47:04,121 --> 00:47:06,321
I want to know
what is discussed...

449
00:47:07,441 --> 00:47:09,481
...and I want to know
what is decided.

450
00:47:11,961 --> 00:47:13,641
And if I lie?

451
00:47:15,481 --> 00:47:17,001
I will know.

452
00:47:25,881 --> 00:47:28,401
You know, Michael thinks
you're the devil...

453
00:47:29,561 --> 00:47:31,921
...and I think he might
actually be right.

454
00:47:33,361 --> 00:47:35,321
That was the other reason
I came here.

455
00:47:35,441 --> 00:47:39,041
What are Michael's real
intentions toward me, Gina?

456
00:47:40,041 --> 00:47:42,441
And if you lie, I will know.

457
00:47:46,921 --> 00:47:47,921
Tommy...

458
00:47:49,601 --> 00:47:52,121
...he intends
to complete the deal.

459
00:47:53,121 --> 00:47:54,681
And then you both walk away.

460
00:48:09,441 --> 00:48:11,241
Fuck!

461
00:49:32,641 --> 00:49:33,841
Come.

462
00:49:36,281 --> 00:49:38,201
Mr Shelby? Dr Holford.

463
00:49:41,321 --> 00:49:42,441
Send him in.

464
00:49:49,761 --> 00:49:53,441
You said it had to be
in person. Here I am.

465
00:49:55,161 --> 00:49:57,481
You might want to sit down.

466
00:50:04,161 --> 00:50:05,401
Mr Shelby, I know

467
00:50:05,521 --> 00:50:07,921
that you are still
grieving for your daughter...

468
00:50:08,921 --> 00:50:10,961
...but I have news
that cannot wait.

469
00:50:16,001 --> 00:50:18,881
When you were X-rayed
and examined

470
00:50:19,001 --> 00:50:21,481
at the sanatorium
ten days ago...

471
00:50:23,201 --> 00:50:26,521
...there was no TB
found in your lung.

472
00:50:28,521 --> 00:50:30,761
But I am afraid
they found something else...

473
00:50:31,761 --> 00:50:34,601
...something related to
your daughter's illness.

474
00:50:37,921 --> 00:50:40,761
They tried to speak to you
at the hospital

475
00:50:40,881 --> 00:50:42,641
but you were not co-operating.

476
00:50:44,721 --> 00:50:46,921
After your daughter's death...

477
00:50:47,041 --> 00:50:49,761
...you could not be found
to be informed in person.

478
00:50:50,761 --> 00:50:54,281
Eventually, as your personal
doctor, they called me.

479
00:50:57,401 --> 00:50:58,641
I didn't offer you tea.

480
00:50:58,761 --> 00:51:00,921
You look like death.
Do you want tea?

481
00:51:02,121 --> 00:51:03,321
No.

482
00:51:04,921 --> 00:51:07,841
At the sanatorium,
they conducted blood tests.

483
00:51:09,841 --> 00:51:13,201
The tests suggest
that the shadow you can see

484
00:51:13,321 --> 00:51:15,521
at the base of your skull...

485
00:51:15,641 --> 00:51:17,121
...is not cancer...

486
00:51:18,481 --> 00:51:20,041
...it is tuberculoma...

487
00:51:22,401 --> 00:51:26,001
...a tubercular growth caused
by the same bacteria as TB.

488
00:51:29,641 --> 00:51:32,161
You may have picked it up
from your daughter.

489
00:51:33,761 --> 00:51:37,881
Once this disease enters
a household, it can run wild.

490
00:51:38,001 --> 00:51:40,521
It can be transmitted
with a simple kiss.

491
00:51:44,681 --> 00:51:47,321
It seems the Shelby household
is no exception.

492
00:51:51,401 --> 00:51:55,921
Mr Shelby, as I say, I am aware
that you are still grieving...

493
00:51:56,041 --> 00:51:59,241
...but you must understand
this is very serious.

494
00:52:01,481 --> 00:52:04,801
From the size of the tumour,
expansion must have been rapid.

495
00:52:06,121 --> 00:52:10,521
I have no doubt that you are
already experiencing symptoms.

496
00:52:11,561 --> 00:52:13,721
Have you recently
suffered seizures?

497
00:52:15,001 --> 00:52:16,601
Bouts of weakness?

498
00:52:16,721 --> 00:52:19,121
Dissociation?

499
00:52:19,241 --> 00:52:20,561
Hallucinations?

500
00:52:28,601 --> 00:52:30,281
Why didn't you come and see me?

501
00:52:32,881 --> 00:52:34,121
I have work to do.

502
00:52:38,201 --> 00:52:40,001
Am I a danger to others?

503
00:52:41,481 --> 00:52:42,961
No.

504
00:52:43,081 --> 00:52:46,681
Unlike TB, tuberculoma
is not infectious.

505
00:52:46,801 --> 00:52:50,721
Mr Shelby,
it is not infectious...

506
00:52:50,841 --> 00:52:52,961
...but in your case...

507
00:52:53,081 --> 00:52:55,521
...I am afraid
it is inoperable.

508
00:52:57,161 --> 00:52:59,041
The growth is
in your brain stem.

509
00:52:59,161 --> 00:53:00,561
Any attempt to remove it

510
00:53:00,681 --> 00:53:03,321
would result in trauma
and brain haemorrhage.

511
00:53:07,641 --> 00:53:09,401
Whilst you were
refusing my calls,

512
00:53:09,521 --> 00:53:10,641
I showed your X-rays

513
00:53:10,761 --> 00:53:13,281
to three of the best surgeons
in the country.

514
00:53:16,801 --> 00:53:18,881
They all said
they would not operate...

515
00:53:19,881 --> 00:53:22,161
...as it would be futile.

516
00:53:22,281 --> 00:53:25,681
Of course, you will want

517
00:53:25,801 --> 00:53:28,361
a second opinion for yourself.

518
00:53:28,481 --> 00:53:29,561
Dr Helen Rutherford

519
00:53:29,681 --> 00:53:33,041
at St Thomas'.
She is a friend.

520
00:53:44,361 --> 00:53:45,761
This...

521
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:48,961
How bad will it get?

522
00:53:55,401 --> 00:53:57,561
As the tumour grows,

523
00:53:57,681 --> 00:54:01,441
the rate of physical and mental
deterioration will increase.

524
00:54:06,001 --> 00:54:10,721
Eventually, you will need
people around you constantly...

525
00:54:10,841 --> 00:54:13,041
...who love you very much.

526
00:54:16,081 --> 00:54:17,561
How long?

527
00:54:20,761 --> 00:54:22,521
I understand
that you have defeated

528
00:54:22,641 --> 00:54:24,041
many enemies, Mr Shelby.

529
00:54:25,241 --> 00:54:27,321
Now you have a new one...

530
00:54:27,441 --> 00:54:28,761
...inside you.

531
00:54:30,281 --> 00:54:31,681
You cannot defeat it...

532
00:54:33,161 --> 00:54:36,441
...but you <i>can</i> keep it at bay
for a while.

533
00:54:36,561 --> 00:54:37,841
If you live correctly,

534
00:54:37,961 --> 00:54:39,921
if you are determined
and if you fight...

535
00:54:40,041 --> 00:54:41,721
I asked you a question.

536
00:54:41,841 --> 00:54:43,721
This time I want an answer.

537
00:54:43,841 --> 00:54:45,641
I don't want
your fucking platitudes.

538
00:54:45,761 --> 00:54:49,921
How long before I need
people around me

539
00:54:50,041 --> 00:54:51,721
who love me very much?

540
00:54:55,961 --> 00:54:57,841
- Sorry.
- It's fine, Lizzie.

541
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:59,001
My accountant here

542
00:54:59,121 --> 00:55:00,561
was just leaving.

543
00:55:05,401 --> 00:55:07,801
I will telephone you
when I get back to London.

544
00:55:07,921 --> 00:55:09,121
No, I don't have enough time.

545
00:55:09,241 --> 00:55:12,041
You're an accountant,
give me a fucking number now.

546
00:55:13,361 --> 00:55:15,241
One year.

547
00:55:15,361 --> 00:55:17,161
Perhaps 18 months.

548
00:55:17,281 --> 00:55:20,641
That's fine.
That's all I need to know.

549
00:55:20,761 --> 00:55:24,321
I will adjust my finances
accordingly. Thank you.

550
00:55:26,041 --> 00:55:28,081
I will write to you, explaining
the full implications.

551
00:55:28,201 --> 00:55:29,641
Yeah, thank you.

552
00:55:33,601 --> 00:55:34,801
Good day.

553
00:55:43,441 --> 00:55:44,841
Something serious?

554
00:55:46,001 --> 00:55:48,241
No. No, just a...

555
00:55:48,361 --> 00:55:51,441
...just a bill I wasn't
expecting, and I...

556
00:55:52,441 --> 00:55:54,001
...I'll have to pay it.

557
00:56:03,921 --> 00:56:06,001
Will you give me
a minute on me own, Lizzie?

558
00:56:10,121 --> 00:56:11,401
Yeah.

559
00:56:26,961 --> 00:56:28,241
Not a devil...

560
00:56:31,321 --> 00:56:34,041
...just an ordinary mortal man.

561
00:56:39,921 --> 00:56:42,361
<i>There will be a war
in this family...</i>

562
00:56:44,321 --> 00:56:46,121
<i>...and one of you will die.</i>

563
00:56:48,561 --> 00:56:50,601
Polly...

564
00:56:51,881 --> 00:56:54,441
...just give me enough time
to do what I have to do.

565
00:56:56,641 --> 00:56:57,961
<i>Kill.</i>

566
00:56:58,081 --> 00:56:59,801
<i>Kill...</i>
