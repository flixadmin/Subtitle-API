1
00:01:09,196 --> 00:01:11,114
<i>So, I know what you're thinking.</i>

2
00:01:11,198 --> 00:01:13,367
<i>Why is that incredibly
handsome hedgehog</i>

3
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:17,120
<i>being chased by a madman
with a mustache from the Civil War?</i>

4
00:01:17,204 --> 00:01:20,958
<i>Well, to be honest, it feels like
I've been running my whole life.</i>

5
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,502
<i>Is this too much?
Am I going too fast?</i>

6
00:01:23,585 --> 00:01:26,421
<i>It's kind of what I do...
You know what? Let's back up.</i>

7
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,932
<i>This is the island where I'm from.</i>

8
00:01:37,849 --> 00:01:39,351
<i>It had everything.</i>

9
00:01:39,434 --> 00:01:41,770
<i>Sandy beaches, cascading waterfalls,</i>

10
00:01:41,853 --> 00:01:43,730
<i>public access to loop-de-loops.</i>

11
00:01:43,814 --> 00:01:45,649
<i>And, I never had to catch a school bus</i>

12
00:01:45,732 --> 00:01:47,985
<i>because I could run
across the entire island</i>

13
00:01:48,068 --> 00:01:49,861
<i>in less than two seconds.</i>

14
00:01:49,945 --> 00:01:51,697
<i>Also, there was no school.</i>

15
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,907
<i>I know, pretty sweet island,
right?</i>

16
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,659
Yeah!

17
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:59,788
<i>I was born with extraordinary powers
and was told to keep them secret.</i>

18
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,499
<i>And like any kid,
I did the exact opposite.</i>

19
00:02:02,582 --> 00:02:03,667
Whoo-hoo!

20
00:02:05,252 --> 00:02:07,838
<i>That's Longclaw.
She took care of me.</i>

21
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,384
<i>She was basically Obi-Wan Kenobi
if Obi-Wan Kenobi had a beak and ate mice.</i>

22
00:02:12,467 --> 00:02:15,012
Sonic, someone could have seen you.

23
00:02:15,095 --> 00:02:17,764
No one saw me. I'm too fast!

24
00:02:17,848 --> 00:02:19,766
And I wanted to bring you this.

25
00:02:23,687 --> 00:02:24,938
Get down!

26
00:02:28,567 --> 00:02:32,154
<i>Turns out, with great power
comes great power-hungry bad guys.</i>

27
00:02:32,237 --> 00:02:34,239
<i>And I led them right to us.</i>

28
00:02:49,046 --> 00:02:50,213
Listen carefully, Sonic.

29
00:02:51,715 --> 00:02:54,676
You have a power unlike
anything I have ever seen.

30
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,095
And that means someone
will always want it.

31
00:02:57,179 --> 00:03:00,891
The only way to stay safe
is to stay hidden.

32
00:03:04,478 --> 00:03:07,105
This world is on the far side
of the universe.

33
00:03:07,189 --> 00:03:08,482
You should be safe there.

34
00:03:08,565 --> 00:03:11,318
- I don't want to go without you.
- You must.

35
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,987
These rings will be your most
important possession.

36
00:03:17,824 --> 00:03:20,410
If you're ever discovered, use one.

37
00:03:20,494 --> 00:03:22,871
Never stop running.

38
00:03:23,538 --> 00:03:24,915
Now go!

39
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:29,878
Longclaw!

40
00:03:31,505 --> 00:03:32,547
Goodbye, Sonic.

41
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,631
No!

42
00:03:35,592 --> 00:03:37,386
No!

43
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:04,830
Come on, one car?

44
00:04:15,048 --> 00:04:16,383
I'm bored.

45
00:04:16,466 --> 00:04:18,106
<i>Tom, do you read me? Are you there?</i>

46
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,847
No, Wade, I'm actually
on a yacht in Barbados.

47
00:04:22,848 --> 00:04:24,099
With Rihanna.

48
00:04:24,182 --> 00:04:25,684
OMG.

49
00:04:25,767 --> 00:04:27,352
That's amazing. Please send pics.

50
00:04:27,436 --> 00:04:29,479
No, Wade. I'm at the speed trap.

51
00:04:29,563 --> 00:04:32,732
Already? How did you get back so fast?
Barbados is in the ocean!

52
00:04:32,816 --> 00:04:34,568
Hang on, I think I got something.

53
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,744
Hey, buddy! Where's the fire?

54
00:04:44,828 --> 00:04:46,621
Got kids living around here.

55
00:04:47,706 --> 00:04:50,250
I thought that was kind of funny.
Sorry.

56
00:04:56,298 --> 00:04:57,632
What?

57
00:05:36,713 --> 00:05:38,691
<i>Tom, we need you down on Main Street.</i>

58
00:05:38,715 --> 00:05:40,550
<i>There's been a violent gang shootout.</i>

59
00:05:42,677 --> 00:05:45,347
<i>Just kidding. A duck stole a bagel.</i>

60
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,516
<i>But they do need it back.</i>

61
00:05:58,735 --> 00:06:01,363
Whoa, buddy, you almost
got yourself killed out there.

62
00:06:01,446 --> 00:06:03,490
What are you,
some kind of adrenaline junkie?

63
00:06:03,573 --> 00:06:05,659
It must be rough being slow all the time.

64
00:06:05,742 --> 00:06:09,037
Tell you what. Today is your lucky day.

65
00:06:11,456 --> 00:06:13,416
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

66
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,835
Have you ever felt so alive?

67
00:06:17,254 --> 00:06:19,756
This is great. You're doing amazing.

68
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:21,341
Oh, geez!

69
00:06:21,883 --> 00:06:23,843
Good recovery.

70
00:06:23,927 --> 00:06:25,679
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

71
00:06:26,596 --> 00:06:28,765
Let's keep this our little secret, okay?

72
00:06:28,848 --> 00:06:32,018
You never saw me. I was never here.

73
00:06:46,366 --> 00:06:48,076
<i>So what were you expecting?</i>

74
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:52,163
<i>A dirty little hedgehog eating berries
and struggling to survive?</i>

75
00:06:52,247 --> 00:06:56,751
<i>Think again. Because I am
living my best life on Earth.</i>

76
00:06:56,835 --> 00:06:58,503
<i>I've got a library...</i>

77
00:07:00,046 --> 00:07:01,715
<i>a home gym,</i>

78
00:07:01,798 --> 00:07:04,384
<i>and a state-of-the-art security system.</i>

79
00:07:16,605 --> 00:07:17,606
Oh, no.

80
00:07:19,024 --> 00:07:22,068
<i>And, if I'm ever discovered,
I'll follow Longclaw's instructions</i>

81
00:07:22,152 --> 00:07:24,988
<i>and use my rings
to escape to a new planet.</i>

82
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:29,242
<i>A nice, safe little world
filled only with mushrooms.</i>

83
00:07:30,827 --> 00:07:33,747
<i>Gross, smelly mushrooms.</i>

84
00:07:34,706 --> 00:07:36,374
I hate mushrooms.

85
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,836
<i>But let's not worry about all that.</i>

86
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,341
<i>This is Green Hills,
the greatest place on Earth.</i>

87
00:07:45,717 --> 00:07:48,136
<i>These are my people and, dare I say,</i>

88
00:07:48,219 --> 00:07:50,639
<i>I am their lovable space creature.</i>

89
00:07:50,722 --> 00:07:52,557
<i>So what if they don't know I exist?</i>

90
00:07:54,517 --> 00:07:57,729
<i>My favorite person is the Donut Lord,</i>

91
00:07:58,647 --> 00:08:00,899
<i>protector of this town</i>

92
00:08:00,982 --> 00:08:03,985
<i>and defender of all creatures,
big and small.</i>

93
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:05,070
Morning.

94
00:08:05,153 --> 00:08:06,946
Donald. Daisy. Daffy.

95
00:08:08,156 --> 00:08:10,617
<i>Donut Lord lives with Pretzel Lady.</i>

96
00:08:11,284 --> 00:08:12,869
<i>She is super nice to animals</i>

97
00:08:12,952 --> 00:08:16,414
<i>and strangely was born without bones.</i>

98
00:08:16,498 --> 00:08:17,999
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

99
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:19,793
<i>There is one person in town</i>

100
00:08:19,876 --> 00:08:21,354
<i>who's actually onto me.</i>

101
00:08:21,378 --> 00:08:23,588
<i>He calls me the blue devil.</i>

102
00:08:23,672 --> 00:08:25,548
I almost caught him last night.

103
00:08:25,632 --> 00:08:27,467
<i>Say hello to Crazy Carl.</i>

104
00:08:31,137 --> 00:08:32,555
<i>We have fun together.</i>

105
00:08:34,307 --> 00:08:36,810
I know you're out there!

106
00:08:36,893 --> 00:08:39,813
And I know you're real!

107
00:08:39,896 --> 00:08:42,440
No, I'm not!

108
00:08:42,524 --> 00:08:44,609
<i>Movie night is my favorite.</i>

109
00:08:44,693 --> 00:08:47,112
Please, please, please, please, please.

110
00:08:47,195 --> 00:08:48,655
Yes! Keanu!

111
00:08:48,738 --> 00:08:50,365
You are a national treasure.

112
00:08:50,448 --> 00:08:52,826
<i>- When I find you...
- Pop quiz, hotshot.</i>

113
00:08:52,909 --> 00:08:54,661
<i>There's a bomb on a bus.</i>

114
00:08:54,744 --> 00:08:56,621
"Pop quiz, hotshot."

115
00:08:56,705 --> 00:08:58,498
It's a classic line.

116
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,542
<i>Basically, we're like a family.</i>

117
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,044
<i>Even though we haven't met yet.</i>

118
00:09:03,128 --> 00:09:05,046
You don't zink your

119
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,632
prolonged isolation is making
you a bit crazy perhaps?

120
00:09:07,716 --> 00:09:09,634
Crazy? Me?

121
00:09:09,718 --> 00:09:12,303
No way, Doc. You got me all wrong.

122
00:09:12,387 --> 00:09:16,766
And despite all these so-called friends
of yours, deep down,

123
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:18,893
...you're still rather lonely?

124
00:09:24,482 --> 00:09:27,902
<i>Perhaps afraid you'll be alone forever?</i>

125
00:09:42,167 --> 00:09:45,920
Uh-uh. Hey! No, no, no, no.

126
00:09:46,004 --> 00:09:47,630
Get out of there. Come on.

127
00:09:47,714 --> 00:09:50,049
Oh, come on! Get out of there!

128
00:09:50,133 --> 00:09:52,552
Get out of there, you trash pandas.

129
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,931
Maddie, as Green Hills'
most respected veterinarian,

130
00:09:57,015 --> 00:10:00,059
what is the fastest way
to exterminate a raccoon?

131
00:10:00,143 --> 00:10:02,604
Hi, Ozzy. Hello! You're glad to see me.

132
00:10:02,687 --> 00:10:03,887
You don't eat garbage, do you?

133
00:10:04,856 --> 00:10:06,024
What's that?

134
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:09,527
- Is that what I think it is?
- Uh-huh. Open it.

135
00:10:10,153 --> 00:10:11,988
Oh, it's kind of small. Is that bad?

136
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,782
Just open it.

137
00:10:18,953 --> 00:10:20,538
"Dear Thomas,

138
00:10:20,622 --> 00:10:23,502
We have reviewed your application
to the San Francisco Police Department,

139
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,211
and pending interdepartmental review
and background check,

140
00:10:26,294 --> 00:10:29,464
we are happy to inform you that you have
been selected to join our team."

141
00:10:29,547 --> 00:10:31,174
- Oh, my God!
- Wow.

142
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,176
Oh, my God.

143
00:10:33,635 --> 00:10:34,636
Ta-da!

144
00:10:35,553 --> 00:10:37,138
"San Francisco Sucks."

145
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:39,432
Oh!

146
00:10:39,516 --> 00:10:40,517
Wrong one!

147
00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:44,687
Ta-da!

148
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:48,525
- You never had a doubt, huh?
- No! Mm-mmm.

149
00:10:50,902 --> 00:10:53,988
- I can't believe this.
- Oh, I know! You did it.

150
00:10:55,698 --> 00:10:57,116
Hey, what are those?

151
00:10:58,368 --> 00:11:00,745
Apartments for rent I found on Zillow.

152
00:11:00,829 --> 00:11:03,456
I thought Ozzy and I
could fly there tomorrow

153
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,417
and check out some neighborhoods.

154
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,254
I mean, this is all happening so fast.

155
00:11:09,337 --> 00:11:12,006
Oh, man... It's the craziest thing.

156
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:14,342
You apply for the job, you get the job.

157
00:11:14,425 --> 00:11:15,927
Well, pending a background check.

158
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,095
Oh, man.

159
00:11:17,178 --> 00:11:20,598
Hope they don't find out about that time
you used the neighbor's Wi-Fi.

160
00:11:20,682 --> 00:11:22,642
Correction: I'm still using
the neighbor's Wi-Fi.

161
00:11:22,725 --> 00:11:26,646
But, Maddie,
are you sure you're okay with this?

162
00:11:26,729 --> 00:11:28,773
Thomas Michael Wachowski,

163
00:11:28,857 --> 00:11:31,192
what did you do the entire time
I was in veterinary school?

164
00:11:31,276 --> 00:11:33,695
I worked a second job
to pay the rent and...

165
00:11:33,778 --> 00:11:35,113
A third job to pay tuition.

166
00:11:35,822 --> 00:11:39,117
You sacrificed for me.
I'm happy to sacrifice for you.

167
00:11:40,869 --> 00:11:43,079
Babe, are you sure you're okay with this?

168
00:11:44,455 --> 00:11:46,749
I mean, there's been
a Wachowski protecting this town

169
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:48,793
for more than 50 years.

170
00:11:49,586 --> 00:11:51,212
This is a big change.

171
00:11:52,088 --> 00:11:53,590
I'm positive.

172
00:11:54,382 --> 00:11:57,218
It's time for this guy to
get out there and prove himself.

173
00:11:57,302 --> 00:12:01,180
I love Green Hills, but, you know,
I want to help people in real trouble.

174
00:12:01,264 --> 00:12:04,475
I want someone to turn to me
in a life-and-death situation

175
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:05,935
and I'll be there for 'em.

176
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,146
I get it.

177
00:12:08,229 --> 00:12:11,190
- I'm so proud of you.
- Thank you.

178
00:12:11,274 --> 00:12:12,525
Mmm!

179
00:12:12,609 --> 00:12:15,069
And so it is with a heavy heart,
that I tell you all

180
00:12:15,153 --> 00:12:18,364
that I've accepted a position
at the San Francisco Police Department,

181
00:12:18,448 --> 00:12:20,158
effective immediately.

182
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,037
It's gonna be tough to leave my hometown
and all my friendships.

183
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,123
But this is something
I feel like I need to do

184
00:12:27,749 --> 00:12:32,295
to grow... as both an officer and a man.

185
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,216
What do you think, Sergeant Sprinkles?

186
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:39,969
That wasn't so bad, right?

187
00:12:41,262 --> 00:12:43,014
Now all I got to do is...

188
00:12:44,057 --> 00:12:45,558
tell everyone who isn't a donut.

189
00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:49,979
Whoa, the playoffs!

190
00:13:33,564 --> 00:13:36,317
Oh! So cool.

191
00:13:41,322 --> 00:13:42,549
Bottom of the ninth, tie score.

192
00:13:42,573 --> 00:13:46,119
And exactly who you want at the plate
with the game on the line: Sonic!

193
00:13:46,202 --> 00:13:47,996
But staring him down
from the pitcher's mound

194
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,290
is the most fearsome southpaw
in Green Hills:

195
00:13:51,374 --> 00:13:52,750
Also Sonic.

196
00:13:52,834 --> 00:13:54,293
Okay. Focus, Sonic.

197
00:13:54,377 --> 00:13:57,338
If you win this game, you'll be
the most beloved kid in Green Hills.

198
00:14:02,135 --> 00:14:05,221
Hit it to the guy in left!
He's a real space case.

199
00:14:08,433 --> 00:14:10,393
I can't with that guy.

200
00:14:10,476 --> 00:14:14,605
Hey, batter Sonic. Hey, batter Sonic.
"Suh-wing," batter Sonic.

201
00:14:22,238 --> 00:14:23,614
I got it, I got it, I got it!

202
00:14:24,657 --> 00:14:25,908
I don't got it.

203
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,836
Go home! Go home!

204
00:14:37,295 --> 00:14:38,671
Come on!

205
00:14:43,718 --> 00:14:44,718
Safe!

206
00:14:46,804 --> 00:14:49,807
Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes! I did it!

207
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,685
Did you see that? I did it. I did it.

208
00:15:05,865 --> 00:15:07,784
I really am alone.

209
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:11,037
All alone. Forever.

210
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:48,699
I'm sure no one noticed that
giant blue explosion, right?

211
00:15:59,043 --> 00:16:00,628
- Hey, Wade.
- Hi, Tom.

212
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,421
Uh, Wade here.

213
00:16:02,505 --> 00:16:04,173
What is going on?

214
00:16:04,257 --> 00:16:05,716
Well, gosh, I think the power's out.

215
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,595
Yeah, no dur! The lights are out.
The whole town is freaking out.

216
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:11,681
- What should I do?
<i>- Okay, relax.</i>

217
00:16:11,764 --> 00:16:13,599
Take a deep breath, call Gil,

218
00:16:13,683 --> 00:16:16,519
see if they can locate
the downed line, then...

219
00:16:16,602 --> 00:16:19,272
call Zim and see if he can
get his generator over to the Super Q

220
00:16:19,355 --> 00:16:20,648
so the food stays... fresh.

221
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:24,485
<i>Call Zim before Gil?</i>

222
00:16:24,569 --> 00:16:26,988
<i>- Call Gil... Hello?</i>
- I'll call you back.

223
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,323
Wait! Hello? Was that
the end of the instructions?

224
00:16:30,783 --> 00:16:33,828
Okay, all right. Uh, you can do this.

225
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:37,748
What was the first thing he said to do?

226
00:16:39,417 --> 00:16:41,502
Right. Relax.

227
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,900
Twenty minutes ago, an energy surge

228
00:17:03,983 --> 00:17:06,485
knocked out power
across the entire Pacific Northwest.

229
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:07,570
What do we know?

230
00:17:07,653 --> 00:17:10,072
Well, our first instinct
was it was an EMP.

231
00:17:10,823 --> 00:17:13,576
But electromagnetic pulses
don't have that kind of power.

232
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:16,245
NASA has ruled out
meteor strikes or solar flares.

233
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:18,807
The Department of Energy says
it's not a power plant malfunction.

234
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:21,709
Well, sounds like we're really good
at figuring out what it wasn't.

235
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:24,086
This could be a prelude
to a larger attack.

236
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:26,315
I'm suggesting we scramble
the Fifth and Sixth Regiment.

237
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:27,506
No, no, no, no.

238
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:30,134
This needs a much more sophisticated mind.

239
00:17:30,218 --> 00:17:32,011
Someone who understands technology.

240
00:17:32,094 --> 00:17:34,847
- You want to send in a lab rat?
- Not just any lab rat.

241
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:36,432
A lab rat with teeth.

242
00:17:36,515 --> 00:17:38,684
You're not suggesting
who I think you're suggesting.

243
00:17:38,768 --> 00:17:40,519
- I know, he's a little weird.
- Weird?

244
00:17:40,603 --> 00:17:43,147
- No. No way.
- He's a psychological tire fire!

245
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:46,651
But he's also brilliant.
Five PhDs, IQ off the charts.

246
00:17:46,734 --> 00:17:49,403
And his drone tech is revolutionary!

247
00:17:49,487 --> 00:17:51,364
You're sure he can handle this?

248
00:17:51,447 --> 00:17:53,366
He has a perfect operations record.

249
00:17:53,449 --> 00:17:55,368
- Remember the coup in Pakistan?
- No.

250
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:56,911
Or the uprising in Azerbaijanistan?

251
00:17:56,994 --> 00:17:59,080
- That's not even a country.
- Exactly.

252
00:17:59,163 --> 00:18:01,374
And you can thank Robotnik for that.

253
00:18:01,457 --> 00:18:04,585
I can't believe you're
bringing that freak into this.

254
00:18:04,669 --> 00:18:07,004
Neither can I, but...

255
00:18:07,922 --> 00:18:09,048
we have no choice.

256
00:18:34,865 --> 00:18:35,866
What the...

257
00:18:57,972 --> 00:18:59,348
Are you in charge here?

258
00:18:59,432 --> 00:19:00,599
- Yes, I am...
- Nope!

259
00:19:00,683 --> 00:19:01,683
- My...
- Wrong!

260
00:19:01,684 --> 00:19:03,019
- name...
- I'm in charge!

261
00:19:03,102 --> 00:19:04,437
- is Major...
- Me!

262
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,605
- Ben...
- I'm in charge.

263
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,660
You've never seen
anything like this before.

264
00:19:10,443 --> 00:19:14,655
It says I'm the top banana
in a world full of hungry little monkeys.

265
00:19:14,739 --> 00:19:17,116
Allow me to clarify.

266
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:19,928
In a sequentially ranked hierarchy
based on level of critical importance,

267
00:19:19,952 --> 00:19:22,079
the disparity between us
is too vast to quantify.

268
00:19:22,163 --> 00:19:24,457
- Agent Stone?
- The Doctor thinks you're basic.

269
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,625
I'm initiating a sweep sequence.

270
00:19:26,709 --> 00:19:29,295
Ten miles in every direction
should suffice.

271
00:19:31,005 --> 00:19:32,965
- Is he still looking at me funny?
- Yes, he is.

272
00:19:33,049 --> 00:19:34,818
Tell him to stop
or I'll pull up his search history.

273
00:19:34,842 --> 00:19:36,552
If you don't stop looking at the Doctor,

274
00:19:36,635 --> 00:19:38,363
- he'll take a closer look...
- I'm not deaf.

275
00:19:38,387 --> 00:19:39,930
And tell him his men report to me now.

276
00:19:40,014 --> 00:19:41,390
Blah-blah-blah.

277
00:19:41,474 --> 00:19:44,143
Excuse me? Listen, pal,
I don't know if you realize...

278
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:46,062
I'm sorry, Major. What was your name?

279
00:19:46,145 --> 00:19:48,689
- Benning...
- Nobody cares!

280
00:19:48,773 --> 00:19:52,276
Nobody cares. Listen, Major Nobody Cares.

281
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,653
You know why
nobody cares who you are?

282
00:19:54,737 --> 00:19:57,114
Because nobody cares about
your feeble accomplishments.

283
00:19:57,198 --> 00:20:00,076
And nobody cares how proud your mommy is

284
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:02,661
that you're now reading
at a third-grade level.

285
00:20:02,745 --> 00:20:04,955
- Mmm.
- Have you finished <i>Charlotte's Web</i> yet?

286
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,291
Spoiler alert: She dies in the end.

287
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:09,418
But she leaves a big creepy egg sac.

288
00:20:11,087 --> 00:20:14,006
Ah... my babies.

289
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:17,093
Whoo! Look what came out of my egg sac.

290
00:20:17,176 --> 00:20:19,261
You know what I love about machines?

291
00:20:20,012 --> 00:20:23,557
They do what they're told.
They follow their programming.

292
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,977
They don't need time off to get drunk
and put the boat in the water.

293
00:20:27,728 --> 00:20:29,563
Now you do what you're told.

294
00:20:29,647 --> 00:20:32,358
Stand over there on the edge
of your personal abyss...

295
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:35,444
and watch my machines do your job.

296
00:20:38,197 --> 00:20:40,658
- Can you feel it, Stone?
- I can feel it, Doctor.

297
00:20:41,325 --> 00:20:43,953
It's evolution, Stone.

298
00:20:44,036 --> 00:20:45,371
It's evolution!

299
00:21:21,407 --> 00:21:23,534
- Agent Stone?
- Doctor.

300
00:21:23,617 --> 00:21:25,536
Do you see anything useful in this image?

301
00:21:26,787 --> 00:21:29,540
- Nothing at all, Doctor.
- Of course you don't.

302
00:21:29,623 --> 00:21:31,543
Your eyes weren't
expertly trained to spot tracks

303
00:21:31,584 --> 00:21:34,170
by the Native American Shadow Wolves.

304
00:21:44,138 --> 00:21:45,264
That's extraordinary.

305
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:50,144
No. What's extraordinary is,
I've determined the exact height, weight

306
00:21:50,227 --> 00:21:51,770
and spinal curvature of this creature,

307
00:21:51,854 --> 00:21:54,356
and my computer
can't find a single match for it

308
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,984
anywhere in Earth's animal kingdom.

309
00:21:58,068 --> 00:22:02,573
This blackout was not a terrorist attack,
and that's no baby bigfoot.

310
00:22:02,656 --> 00:22:06,160
This guy is something else...

311
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:09,205
entirely.

312
00:22:09,288 --> 00:22:12,041
Divert all search units
to the site of the footprint.

313
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,503
That's one small step for man,

314
00:22:15,586 --> 00:22:17,880
one giant leap for me.

315
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,143
Okay, okay, everything is fine.

316
00:22:31,227 --> 00:22:33,312
You played some baseball,
got a little upset,

317
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:36,398
lightning shot out of your butt,
and now they're coming for you.

318
00:22:37,733 --> 00:22:39,573
All right, all right.
Earth isn't safe anymore.

319
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:41,529
Time for plan B. Mushroomville.

320
00:22:41,612 --> 00:22:44,406
But I gotta take my stuff.
Okay, essential items only.

321
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:46,825
Okay, toothbrush, toothpaste,
hair gel, night-light.

322
00:22:46,909 --> 00:22:48,953
Funny hat. This half-eaten cantaloupe.

323
00:22:49,036 --> 00:22:50,913
Oh, and my scented candle.

324
00:22:50,996 --> 00:22:53,082
My entire comic book collection.
Bean bag chair.

325
00:22:53,165 --> 00:22:54,750
Can a bean bag chair fit in a backpack?

326
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:56,669
No, no, no. Of course not. That's stupid.

327
00:22:56,752 --> 00:23:00,548
Okay, what else? The rings!
The rings, yes, of course.

328
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:03,217
Here we go. Ring time.

329
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,761
Mushroom planet, here I come.

330
00:23:05,844 --> 00:23:07,179
Oh, no. They're right outside.

331
00:23:07,263 --> 00:23:10,015
I gotta go somewhere else.

332
00:23:13,644 --> 00:23:15,312
Goodbye, cave.

333
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,110
- Hey.
<i>- Hey.</i>

334
00:23:21,193 --> 00:23:22,194
Whatcha doing?

335
00:23:22,278 --> 00:23:24,780
Just coloring with Jojo and Rachel.

336
00:23:24,863 --> 00:23:26,949
Ah, that sounds... half-fun.

337
00:23:27,032 --> 00:23:29,201
Hey, exciting stuff here.
We had a power outage.

338
00:23:29,285 --> 00:23:31,161
The whole town went dark.

339
00:23:31,245 --> 00:23:33,581
It was like a sign telling me
to get out of Dodge.

340
00:23:33,664 --> 00:23:35,708
- Wade must have lost his mind.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

341
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:38,210
And he does not have much to lose.

342
00:23:38,294 --> 00:23:40,921
How's your sister?
Did she convince you to leave me yet?

343
00:23:41,005 --> 00:23:44,258
No, but she did tell me
to check your phone for dating apps.

344
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,486
<i>The only apps on my phone
are the ones that came with it.</i>

345
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:48,470
- And the Olive Garden.
<i>- Ah.</i>

346
00:23:48,554 --> 00:23:50,323
- Because when you're there...
- You're family.

347
00:23:52,725 --> 00:23:54,018
No way.

348
00:23:56,604 --> 00:23:57,896
The raccoons are back.

349
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,857
And they are in for a surprise.

350
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,359
Your surprise better not be
my tranquilizer gun.

351
00:24:02,443 --> 00:24:03,444
They're just hungry.

352
00:24:03,527 --> 00:24:06,196
<i>And also, that's for bears.</i>

353
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,283
- Good. Now I know it'll work.
<i>- Tom!</i>

354
00:24:09,366 --> 00:24:11,493
I'm kidding. I'm just gonna
use it to scare 'em.

355
00:24:11,577 --> 00:24:12,828
Possibly to death.

356
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:14,151
<i>- Love you, honey, bye!</i>
- Tom...

357
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:21,211
D-I-V-O-R-C-E.

358
00:24:23,672 --> 00:24:24,923
Okay, I'm in.

359
00:24:25,007 --> 00:24:27,676
With minimal damage
to Donut Lord's property.

360
00:24:28,594 --> 00:24:29,762
Here we go.

361
00:24:29,845 --> 00:24:31,406
It didn't work out on Earth,
but that's okay.

362
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:32,723
You're going to a safe world.

363
00:24:32,806 --> 00:24:35,309
A nice, safe world full of mushrooms.

364
00:24:35,392 --> 00:24:38,562
Mushrooms that'll be your only friends.

365
00:24:38,646 --> 00:24:40,564
That sounds awful. I can't do this.

366
00:24:40,648 --> 00:24:42,691
You have to do it.
There's no other option.

367
00:24:43,692 --> 00:24:45,778
All right.

368
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:49,740
SFPD, pending background check.

369
00:24:49,823 --> 00:24:51,325
Paws in the air!

370
00:24:53,077 --> 00:24:55,704
Uh, meow?

371
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,294
Ow!

372
00:25:04,129 --> 00:25:07,257
"San... Francisco?"

373
00:25:29,405 --> 00:25:31,907
No.

374
00:25:35,452 --> 00:25:36,995
What?

375
00:25:59,393 --> 00:26:01,061
The blue devil.

376
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,452
- Donut Lord?
- It can talk.

377
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:19,580
You're not...
You're not here to abduct me, are you?

378
00:26:19,663 --> 00:26:21,081
You abducted me.

379
00:26:22,666 --> 00:26:24,835
Okay, that's a fair point. What are you?

380
00:26:24,918 --> 00:26:26,754
Why are you hiding out in my garage?

381
00:26:26,837 --> 00:26:28,172
I needed somewhere safe.

382
00:26:28,255 --> 00:26:30,632
And you're the only person
I could think of, Donut Lord.

383
00:26:30,716 --> 00:26:32,068
Why do you keep calling me Donut Lord?

384
00:26:32,092 --> 00:26:34,970
'Cause you talk to donuts.
And then eat them if they get out of line.

385
00:26:35,512 --> 00:26:36,805
Again, fair.

386
00:26:36,889 --> 00:26:38,324
Wait, wait, wait.
Where are all the mushrooms?

387
00:26:38,348 --> 00:26:39,892
Why am I still on Earth? What is...

388
00:26:39,975 --> 00:26:42,686
Oh, no! I lost my rings.

389
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:44,062
What?

390
00:26:49,943 --> 00:26:52,362
What's happening?
Is this your mother ship?

391
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,656
I'm not in the mood to get probed.

392
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:57,451
You think you're worried?
I'm not even wearing pants.

393
00:27:00,996 --> 00:27:03,207
What the...

394
00:27:04,917 --> 00:27:06,394
- They're coming for me!
- Who's coming for you?

395
00:27:06,418 --> 00:27:07,479
What's that got to do with me?

396
00:27:07,503 --> 00:27:09,439
I don't have time to explain,
but you have to help me.

397
00:27:09,463 --> 00:27:11,548
No, I don't. Why?

398
00:27:11,632 --> 00:27:15,135
Well, my legs, which normally
would be classified as lethal weapons,

399
00:27:15,219 --> 00:27:16,345
feel like spaghetti.

400
00:27:16,428 --> 00:27:19,223
I need your help. Please.
It's life or death.

401
00:27:27,189 --> 00:27:28,732
Fine. Come with me.

402
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:33,612
Uh, little help?

403
00:27:44,915 --> 00:27:46,834
All right, stay here. And be quiet.

404
00:27:46,917 --> 00:27:49,670
Good plan. Great plan!
We're already working so well together.

405
00:27:49,753 --> 00:27:51,672
Practically finishing
each other's sentences.

406
00:27:53,507 --> 00:27:54,716
Okay, bye.

407
00:27:58,136 --> 00:27:59,429
Hello there!

408
00:28:00,305 --> 00:28:01,431
Can I help you?

409
00:28:05,227 --> 00:28:06,687
Good morning, my rural chum.

410
00:28:08,105 --> 00:28:11,692
I'm... from the power company,
investigating the blackout.

411
00:28:11,775 --> 00:28:15,112
If you don't mind, I'd like to take
a few readings inside your house?

412
00:28:15,195 --> 00:28:16,875
No kidding? You're from the power company?

413
00:28:16,905 --> 00:28:18,508
- Mmm.
- Oh, you must know my buddy Spencer.

414
00:28:18,532 --> 00:28:21,285
- We play softball together.
- Ah! Spence.

415
00:28:21,952 --> 00:28:23,370
He's a good man.

416
00:28:24,246 --> 00:28:26,915
- Yeah. Come on in!
- Great.

417
00:28:26,999 --> 00:28:28,375
Take all the readings you need.

418
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:30,210
Except, uh...

419
00:28:30,294 --> 00:28:33,338
doesn't the power company usually take
their readings from outside the house?

420
00:28:33,422 --> 00:28:35,502
That way they can check them
even if you're not home.

421
00:28:36,216 --> 00:28:38,552
Also, my buddy Spencer
works for the gas company,

422
00:28:38,635 --> 00:28:40,275
and he's more of an Ultimate Frisbee guy.

423
00:28:40,304 --> 00:28:42,931
So, you want to tell me
why you think I'm dumb enough

424
00:28:43,015 --> 00:28:44,558
to just let you walk inside my house?

425
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,736
- I'm sorry, Mister...
- Wachowski.

426
00:28:55,819 --> 00:28:57,696
But everyone calls me Tom.

427
00:28:57,779 --> 00:28:59,656
Except my dentist, he calls me Tim.

428
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:02,700
But it's gone on for so long now
that it would be weird if I corrected him.

429
00:29:03,368 --> 00:29:05,579
Well, Tom, whose dentist calls him Tim,

430
00:29:05,662 --> 00:29:09,374
you may have noticed that this entire town
has been experiencing a power outage.

431
00:29:09,458 --> 00:29:11,501
Yep, no lights. Picked up on that.

432
00:29:11,585 --> 00:29:14,421
Twenty minutes ago, I tracked
an energy pulse with a similar signature

433
00:29:14,504 --> 00:29:16,590
to the one that caused that disruption.

434
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,440
Listen, uh, Mister...

435
00:29:33,523 --> 00:29:34,900
Doctor.

436
00:29:34,983 --> 00:29:37,653
Dr. Robotnik. But my dentist calls me Rob.

437
00:29:37,736 --> 00:29:39,446
Hmm.

438
00:29:39,529 --> 00:29:42,908
Look, uh, Dr. Robotskeez.

439
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,077
Um, I'm sure what you're here for
is very serious,

440
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,560
but it's got nothing to do with me.

441
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:47,913
You can ask anyone in town.

442
00:29:47,996 --> 00:29:49,957
- Everyone knows me.
- I bet they do.

443
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:53,293
I'm sure you're hella popular
with the Jebs and Merles and Billy Bobs,

444
00:29:53,377 --> 00:29:55,963
in this glorified gas-station rest stop.

445
00:29:56,046 --> 00:29:58,173
Betcha go way back
to the days of tippin' cows

446
00:29:58,256 --> 00:30:00,175
and playin' in a jug band!

447
00:30:03,136 --> 00:30:06,056
And maybe someday you'll achieve your goal

448
00:30:06,139 --> 00:30:08,809
of getting a Costco card
or adopting a Labradoodle.

449
00:30:08,892 --> 00:30:14,481
But the reality is, I surpassed
everything you're ever going to do...

450
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:17,359
before I was a toddler.

451
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:21,363
I was spitting out formulas
while you were still spitting up formula.

452
00:30:21,863 --> 00:30:23,240
I was breastfed, actually.

453
00:30:23,323 --> 00:30:26,326
Nice. Rub that in my orphan face.

454
00:30:27,077 --> 00:30:28,245
Mr. Wachowski,

455
00:30:28,328 --> 00:30:33,041
are you familiar with US Code 904,
Title 10, Article 104?

456
00:30:33,834 --> 00:30:35,502
- Yeah, who isn't...
- "Anyone...

457
00:30:35,585 --> 00:30:39,339
who attempts to aid an enemy
of the United States shall suffer death."

458
00:30:40,757 --> 00:30:43,301
And if I'm the one that catches you,

459
00:30:43,385 --> 00:30:44,594
it'll be even worse.

460
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,015
Worse than death?

461
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,036
Okay, I'm a ball,
just a normal ball.

462
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,329
I'm blending in like a ball.

463
00:30:53,353 --> 00:30:56,815
Shh. Stop talking. No, <i>you</i> stop talking.
Be quiet, Sonic<i>. You</i> be quiet, Sonic.

464
00:30:56,898 --> 00:30:59,484
Oh, I hope they aren't
scanning me with X-rays.

465
00:30:59,568 --> 00:31:01,319
I had kind of an embarrassing lunch.

466
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:11,830
Don't freak out.
Don't freak out. Don't freak out.

467
00:31:11,913 --> 00:31:14,332
Don't freak out.
Don't freak out. Don't freak out.

468
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:16,293
I'm freaking out!

469
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,131
Why don't you have
your staircase carpeted?

470
00:31:21,214 --> 00:31:23,050
Compared to what I...

471
00:31:25,802 --> 00:31:27,429
- Old pipes.
- Yeah.

472
00:31:27,512 --> 00:31:28,972
Probably just the house settling.

473
00:31:29,056 --> 00:31:30,724
Nothing to see here!

474
00:31:31,975 --> 00:31:33,018
Hey!

475
00:31:38,356 --> 00:31:39,775
Here's the thing.

476
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:42,736
I'm never wrong.

477
00:31:43,487 --> 00:31:45,906
Well, first time for everything, I guess.

478
00:31:45,989 --> 00:31:47,365
Would you like some cake?

479
00:31:47,449 --> 00:31:50,729
I hear raccoons have the cleanest mouths
of any animal that routinely eats garbage.

480
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:04,382
Look at that.

481
00:32:05,383 --> 00:32:07,219
I was right.

482
00:32:07,302 --> 00:32:09,554
Note the lack of surprise.

483
00:32:09,638 --> 00:32:11,306
Shall we try this again?

484
00:32:21,733 --> 00:32:25,695
I'm going to give you five seconds
to tell me where it is.

485
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:27,423
- Five...
- I don't know what you're talking about.

486
00:32:27,447 --> 00:32:28,865
- Four.
- Hey, tough guy. I'm a cop,

487
00:32:28,949 --> 00:32:30,301
and you're threatening an officer.

488
00:32:30,325 --> 00:32:32,494
How can you threaten somebody
who never existed?

489
00:32:32,577 --> 00:32:33,995
Three...

490
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:35,914
Come on! Rack your brain.

491
00:32:35,997 --> 00:32:40,710
You might be able to come up with some
lame excuse to go on living, in two...

492
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:42,754
one.

493
00:32:43,588 --> 00:32:44,965
Wait! Don't hurt him!

494
00:32:58,854 --> 00:33:00,397
This feels excessive.

495
00:33:04,067 --> 00:33:05,193
Stay behind me.

496
00:33:18,915 --> 00:33:20,208
Hiya!

497
00:33:21,459 --> 00:33:23,628
Don't worry.
I got it right where I want it!

498
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:29,718
Can you believe Amazon is gonna deliver
packages with these things?

499
00:33:32,429 --> 00:33:35,182
This was a horrible plan!
What was I thinking?

500
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,102
I'm gonna puke!

501
00:33:43,315 --> 00:33:46,109
Come on! We gotta get out of here.

502
00:33:46,193 --> 00:33:48,111
Oh, don't tell me that's all you got!

503
00:33:48,195 --> 00:33:49,529
I'm just getting started!

504
00:33:49,613 --> 00:33:51,823
Let me know if you want to go
round two with the blue.

505
00:34:11,384 --> 00:34:13,595
Doctor! Are you okay?

506
00:34:14,137 --> 00:34:16,097
I saw a guy race out of here and thought...

507
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,891
That you should stop them?

508
00:34:18,934 --> 00:34:20,101
Open your mouth...

509
00:34:20,602 --> 00:34:22,604
and say you thought that you
should stop them.

510
00:34:22,687 --> 00:34:26,233
No, I thought that maybe I should check
to see if you were okay...

511
00:34:26,316 --> 00:34:28,916
You know what's hard about being
the smartest person in the world?

512
00:34:28,985 --> 00:34:32,155
- Everyone else seems stupid.
- Stupid, yes! Way to go!

513
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,365
You got that one.

514
00:34:35,075 --> 00:34:38,995
Whatever this creature is,
it's our job to secure it,

515
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:42,999
neutralize it,
uncover the source of its power.

516
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:44,501
And if it resists...

517
00:34:45,543 --> 00:34:48,797
we take it apart... piece by piece.

518
00:34:50,382 --> 00:34:51,967
See what makes it tick.

519
00:34:53,343 --> 00:34:54,678
- Stone?
- Doctor?

520
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,388
Call Optical Illusions.

521
00:34:57,138 --> 00:34:58,723
Tell them I need new frames.

522
00:34:59,474 --> 00:35:00,892
They know what kind I like.

523
00:35:01,643 --> 00:35:03,979
Oh, and bring that quill.

524
00:35:05,188 --> 00:35:06,481
Yes, Doctor.

525
00:35:09,693 --> 00:35:12,529
All right, pal,
you need to start talking right now.

526
00:35:12,612 --> 00:35:15,031
Who are you? What are you?

527
00:35:15,115 --> 00:35:17,742
I'm a hedgehog!
I feel like that's obvious.

528
00:35:17,826 --> 00:35:19,202
And I'm in big trouble.

529
00:35:19,286 --> 00:35:20,537
Oh, <i>you're</i> in big trouble?

530
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:23,099
You're not the one who punched
some government weirdo back there.

531
00:35:23,123 --> 00:35:25,917
You think <i>you</i> have problems?
I lost my rings.

532
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,721
- Rings? What are you talking about?
- Okay.

533
00:35:27,794 --> 00:35:31,464
Rings are how all advanced cultures
travel between worlds.

534
00:35:31,548 --> 00:35:34,009
And now mine are
on top of a pointy building

535
00:35:34,092 --> 00:35:36,469
I've only ever seen
on your skintight T-shirt.

536
00:35:36,553 --> 00:35:37,553
Hey.

537
00:35:37,554 --> 00:35:39,514
So, I'd like you to take me
to San Francisco,

538
00:35:39,597 --> 00:35:42,851
so I can get back my rings and use them
to go to the mushroom planet.

539
00:35:44,436 --> 00:35:46,438
- Mushroom planet.
- Yes!

540
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:48,398
Right.

541
00:35:52,235 --> 00:35:54,863
- Okay, pal, out you go.
- I'm sorry, what?

542
00:35:54,946 --> 00:35:58,825
Look, this is the worst possible time
for me to get myself into trouble, okay?

543
00:35:58,908 --> 00:36:01,036
You asked me to save your life,
I saved your life.

544
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:04,289
Now, please, go find your rings.
And your mushroom land.

545
00:36:04,372 --> 00:36:06,100
Hopefully I'm gonna wake up
in a hospital bed

546
00:36:06,124 --> 00:36:08,644
and the doctor's gonna tell me
that my colonoscopy was a big success.

547
00:36:08,668 --> 00:36:09,669
Okay? So goodbye.

548
00:36:10,337 --> 00:36:12,964
- Okay. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

549
00:36:15,759 --> 00:36:18,720
- Why aren't you leaving?
- I don't know where San Francisco is.

550
00:36:18,803 --> 00:36:19,888
- It's west.
- West?

551
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:21,115
Straight shot, can't miss it.

552
00:36:21,139 --> 00:36:22,265
Fine. That's cool.

553
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:24,184
I'm totally cool saying goodbye now.

554
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:33,485
So, as I crashed into the cold,
dark water of the Pacific,

555
00:36:33,568 --> 00:36:35,278
I realized a few things.

556
00:36:36,029 --> 00:36:38,323
A, I have no idea where I'm going.

557
00:36:38,406 --> 00:36:40,658
B, saltwater stings.

558
00:36:40,742 --> 00:36:45,038
C, I shouldn't even be on
this planet right now, but I am.

559
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,998
Why? Because you shot me!

560
00:36:47,082 --> 00:36:49,000
- I know.
- You shot me!

561
00:36:49,084 --> 00:36:53,254
All right, I heard you the first time.
You don't have to pile it on. Good grief.

562
00:36:53,338 --> 00:36:56,216
I'm wet. I'm cold.

563
00:36:56,299 --> 00:36:58,176
There's a fish on my head!

564
00:36:58,259 --> 00:37:01,471
And clearly, I'm not gonna be able
to do this on my own.

565
00:37:06,184 --> 00:37:08,770
All right, get in the truck.

566
00:37:08,853 --> 00:37:10,605
Really? You're gonna help me?

567
00:37:10,688 --> 00:37:13,334
I guess it is a little bit my fault
that all this is happening to you.

568
00:37:13,358 --> 00:37:16,486
Not a little bit. Entirely.
It is entirely your fault.

569
00:37:16,569 --> 00:37:18,329
Okay, it's entirely my fault.
Are you coming?

570
00:37:18,863 --> 00:37:19,906
Yes.

571
00:37:22,367 --> 00:37:23,910
Road trip! Whoop-whoop!

572
00:37:23,993 --> 00:37:25,620
What am I doing?

573
00:37:26,913 --> 00:37:28,641
All right, there's
gonna be rules on this trip.

574
00:37:28,665 --> 00:37:31,501
Number one,
do exactly as I say all the time.

575
00:37:31,584 --> 00:37:33,670
- Got it?
- Got it, Donut Lord.

576
00:37:33,753 --> 00:37:35,380
Would you stop with the "Donut Lord"?

577
00:37:36,214 --> 00:37:37,799
I have a name. It's Tom.

578
00:37:38,425 --> 00:37:39,426
I'm Sonic.

579
00:37:39,509 --> 00:37:41,845
Sonic. Sonic.

580
00:37:43,263 --> 00:37:45,640
So you've been spying on us all for years.

581
00:37:45,723 --> 00:37:47,159
I mean, I wouldn't call it "spying."

582
00:37:47,183 --> 00:37:49,727
We were all just hanging out,
only I wasn't invited

583
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:51,187
and no one knew I was there.

584
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:53,773
I can't believe Crazy Carl
was right all this time.

585
00:37:53,857 --> 00:37:56,568
Yeah. You should call him
Super Observant Carl instead.

586
00:37:57,819 --> 00:37:59,988
- Oh, my God, stop the car right now!
- What? What?

587
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:02,240
"The World's Largest Rubberband Ball"?

588
00:38:02,323 --> 00:38:04,534
- We gotta see it!
- No. No.

589
00:38:04,617 --> 00:38:07,287
No, this is not some
fun family road trip, okay?

590
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:11,082
The government wants to dissect you
and arrest me. This is serious.

591
00:38:12,625 --> 00:38:14,252
Eh, you're right, it was lame.

592
00:38:14,335 --> 00:38:16,754
Gift shop was cool, though.
I got you a mouse pad.

593
00:38:16,838 --> 00:38:18,506
When are we gonna get there?

594
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:20,675
We will get there when we get there.

595
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:42,655
I'm gonna go check in with Wade,
see if he knows what's going on.

596
00:38:42,739 --> 00:38:45,241
You're gonna see Wade in that glass thing?

597
00:38:45,325 --> 00:38:47,285
What is it, a teleportation box?

598
00:38:49,037 --> 00:38:50,121
It's a pay phone.

599
00:38:50,205 --> 00:38:53,583
It's mostly for drug dealers
and fugitives from the law, which is us.

600
00:38:53,666 --> 00:38:55,352
Stay in the car.
I don't want anybody seeing you.

601
00:38:55,376 --> 00:38:57,337
Fine.

602
00:39:08,264 --> 00:39:09,265
Huh?

603
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:20,568
Okay, okay. That is the coolest place
on Earth, but you have to stay in the car.

604
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:32,539
Be strong. Be strong.

605
00:39:35,542 --> 00:39:36,543
Hmm.

606
00:39:39,754 --> 00:39:41,839
Hello. Green Hills Police Department.

607
00:39:41,923 --> 00:39:43,675
- Wade, it's me.
<i>- Hi.</i>

608
00:39:43,758 --> 00:39:45,051
I'm so glad that you called.

609
00:39:45,134 --> 00:39:47,804
Uh, so, some guys came in
asking some questions.

610
00:39:47,887 --> 00:39:49,556
Uh, they're a little creepy.

611
00:39:49,639 --> 00:39:52,308
Kind of reminded me of
the guys from <i>Men in Black,</i>

612
00:39:52,392 --> 00:39:55,687
but not as likable
or charming as Will Smith.

613
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:57,063
Wait, what kind of questions?

614
00:39:57,146 --> 00:40:00,525
Um, questions about terrorism?

615
00:40:00,608 --> 00:40:03,736
I told them that
I've gone ice fishing with Tom.

616
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:05,238
He doesn't know how to make a bomb.

617
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,699
<i>He can't even make bait in the cold.</i>

618
00:40:07,782 --> 00:40:09,802
All right, Wade, listen to me.
This is really important.

619
00:40:09,826 --> 00:40:11,327
Don't tell them that we talked, okay?

620
00:40:14,914 --> 00:40:16,958
You know, I think they already know.

621
00:40:19,252 --> 00:40:21,421
Mr. Wachowski.

622
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,964
Tom.

623
00:40:23,047 --> 00:40:24,882
I want you to know
that the only other person

624
00:40:24,966 --> 00:40:28,177
who ever punched me in the face
was the school bully.

625
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,805
He hit me in the cafeteria,
causing a blunt-force contusion

626
00:40:30,888 --> 00:40:33,516
to the soft tissue
surrounding my orbital bone.

627
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,643
Humiliated me in front of
the entire school!

628
00:40:35,727 --> 00:40:37,395
And do you know what I did in response?

629
00:40:37,478 --> 00:40:40,607
Uh, I'm assuming that you reported him
to the principal's office

630
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:42,626
'cause that kind of behavior
is really unacceptable.

631
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:45,945
No. I examined the inefficiency of a world
where brawn trumped brain,

632
00:40:46,029 --> 00:40:48,990
and I used technology
to resolve that inefficiency.

633
00:40:49,073 --> 00:40:52,160
The boy ate his meals
through a straw for a year.

634
00:40:52,243 --> 00:40:53,995
And I have never lost a fight again.

635
00:40:54,495 --> 00:40:55,496
Until today.

636
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:57,248
Hey, hooray for me then, huh?

637
00:40:57,332 --> 00:41:00,168
No, because you're about to become
the bully with the straw!

638
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:02,837
I'm coming for you, Mr. Wachowski.

639
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,297
And when I catch you, I'll...

640
00:41:04,922 --> 00:41:06,841
Hello.

641
00:41:06,924 --> 00:41:08,009
Hello?

642
00:41:08,676 --> 00:41:09,677
Hello, hello, hello?

643
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,014
I think he actually hung up,
because I notice that the light isn't on.

644
00:41:13,097 --> 00:41:14,599
Thank you, Officer Brainfart.

645
00:41:14,682 --> 00:41:16,809
If you give me a second,
I can get an outside line.

646
00:41:16,893 --> 00:41:19,103
No. Don't be bothered.

647
00:41:19,187 --> 00:41:24,108
You just sit there and be "u"... 'seless.

648
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:33,785
No one's gonna erase my memory here?

649
00:41:34,994 --> 00:41:36,788
I will tell people about this!

650
00:41:39,832 --> 00:41:43,294
Okay, not exactly
the healthiest meal, but...

651
00:41:44,337 --> 00:41:45,505
Sonic?

652
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:50,885
Oh, no.

653
00:41:51,552 --> 00:41:53,179
No, no, no, no, no!

654
00:41:57,809 --> 00:41:59,769
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

655
00:42:08,194 --> 00:42:09,654
Howdy, pardner!

656
00:42:09,737 --> 00:42:11,173
I'm not your partner.
Come on. We're leaving.

657
00:42:11,197 --> 00:42:13,950
But there's a ZZ Top cover band.
You gotta see their beards.

658
00:42:14,033 --> 00:42:16,553
You're gonna have to catch 'em
some other time. Let's go. Get up!

659
00:42:16,577 --> 00:42:19,539
If we stay, I won't say another
word for the rest of the trip,

660
00:42:19,622 --> 00:42:21,165
starting... now.

661
00:42:22,709 --> 00:42:24,877
Welcome to the Piston Pit.
What can I get you fellas?

662
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,255
I want nachos and buffalo wings,
oh, and guac.

663
00:42:27,338 --> 00:42:29,716
Funny word, isn't it? Guac, guac! Guac.

664
00:42:29,799 --> 00:42:32,885
Hey, no kids allowed in here.
What's he got on, some kind of mask?

665
00:42:32,969 --> 00:42:38,599
Oh, he's actually 43 years old and, um,
suffers from a very rare skin disease

666
00:42:38,683 --> 00:42:42,979
that stunts his growth
and makes him look, uh, like that.

667
00:42:43,062 --> 00:42:44,272
The face, I was born with.

668
00:42:44,355 --> 00:42:46,733
The confidence, I picked up along the way.

669
00:42:46,816 --> 00:42:49,777
- Make his a Mello Yello, please.
- Okay.

670
00:42:51,028 --> 00:42:53,656
- You owe me one.
- I never sat on a barstool before.

671
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:55,199
So squishy!

672
00:42:55,283 --> 00:42:56,868
Oh, look at this. It spins.

673
00:42:57,702 --> 00:42:58,870
- Yes.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

674
00:42:58,953 --> 00:43:00,788
- That's nice.
- I feel sick.

675
00:43:00,872 --> 00:43:02,123
Are you having fun?

676
00:43:02,206 --> 00:43:03,892
Gonna check this off
the ol' bucket list, huh?

677
00:43:03,916 --> 00:43:05,918
- Big night for you.
- What's a bucket list?

678
00:43:06,002 --> 00:43:08,838
A bucket list is, uh...

679
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,507
It's a list of things
you want to do in your life

680
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:13,968
before you, well, kick the bucket.

681
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:15,678
I've never kicked a bucket, either!

682
00:43:15,762 --> 00:43:17,472
Oh, I gotta make my list.

683
00:43:20,224 --> 00:43:21,684
Uh-huh. Mm-hmm.

684
00:43:21,768 --> 00:43:23,895
Oh, Sonic!

685
00:43:24,729 --> 00:43:25,980
Uh-huh.

686
00:43:30,985 --> 00:43:32,278
What? What's the matter?

687
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,697
There's so much stuff I've never done.

688
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:38,576
And now that I'm leaving Earth forever,
I guess I missed my chance.

689
00:43:44,874 --> 00:43:47,770
Well, I guess this is the kind of place
you could get a lot of living done

690
00:43:47,794 --> 00:43:49,462
in a short period of time.

691
00:43:50,296 --> 00:43:51,547
I suppose we can spare an hour.

692
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:54,175
What? You're gonna bucket-list with me?

693
00:43:54,258 --> 00:43:57,094
- Sure, why not?
- You won't regret this.

694
00:43:57,178 --> 00:43:58,679
Oh, I'm pretty sure I will.

695
00:44:22,578 --> 00:44:24,497
New high score!

696
00:44:26,958 --> 00:44:28,543
Yippee-ki-yay!

697
00:44:29,085 --> 00:44:30,336
Ah-ha!

698
00:44:30,419 --> 00:44:34,131
Wait a second, is this bull missing a head
or does it have two butts?

699
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,469
This is easy.

700
00:44:38,553 --> 00:44:41,305
- Okay.
- Ha-ha! Yeehaw!

701
00:44:44,308 --> 00:44:45,685
I'm a cowboy, baby!

702
00:44:48,938 --> 00:44:50,565
I'm okay.

703
00:44:53,192 --> 00:44:55,236
Whoo!

704
00:44:56,279 --> 00:44:57,989
Whoo! Yeah!

705
00:44:58,072 --> 00:45:00,366
Ha-ha-ha!

706
00:45:00,449 --> 00:45:01,534
Yeah, yeah, laugh it up.

707
00:45:01,617 --> 00:45:03,119
Nice work, Romeo.

708
00:45:03,202 --> 00:45:05,097
Glad you're having a good time.

709
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,539
I am having a good time!

710
00:45:06,622 --> 00:45:09,500
I'm having the best time.
I mean, what could go wrong?

711
00:45:11,586 --> 00:45:12,795
Uh...

712
00:45:13,838 --> 00:45:15,214
Can we help you?

713
00:45:15,298 --> 00:45:16,924
We don't like your kind around here.

714
00:45:17,008 --> 00:45:18,968
Our kind? What kind is that?

715
00:45:21,095 --> 00:45:22,388
Hipsters.

716
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:24,849
- How dare you.
- Oh, hey. You know what?

717
00:45:24,932 --> 00:45:27,244
We were leaving anyway. Weren't we?
There's not a problem here.

718
00:45:27,268 --> 00:45:29,353
- No, no, no, it's okay.
- No, no, no, we're leaving.

719
00:45:29,437 --> 00:45:32,189
I know exactly
how to handle this situation.

720
00:45:32,273 --> 00:45:34,901
Pop quiz, hotshot.

721
00:45:34,984 --> 00:45:37,320
You just picked a fight with
a poorly disguised hedgehog

722
00:45:37,403 --> 00:45:39,530
who's seen way too many action movies.

723
00:45:39,614 --> 00:45:42,033
What do you do? What do you do?

724
00:45:43,618 --> 00:45:46,579
Huh. Am I crazy?
It's supposed to break, right?

725
00:45:46,662 --> 00:45:49,582
Dink! Dink-dink!
Break, please. Break, please.

726
00:45:49,665 --> 00:45:51,059
Break this bottle, please.

727
00:45:51,083 --> 00:45:52,352
- Please, please, please.
- Uh, Sonic?

728
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:54,837
Uh-oh!

729
00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:05,514
- Oh-ho-ho-ho!
- Nice going!

730
00:46:05,598 --> 00:46:07,558
Thanks! It's awesome right?

731
00:46:07,642 --> 00:46:09,077
All right, who's next? Who wants some?

732
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,770
Who do I get to beat up?

733
00:46:11,812 --> 00:46:13,689
Hey! Has anybody seen my waitress?

734
00:46:13,773 --> 00:46:15,816
Still waiting on those buffalo wings.

735
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:18,361
Why, you!

736
00:46:21,614 --> 00:46:23,407
Ha-ha-ha!

737
00:46:25,034 --> 00:46:27,078
Uh-oh!

738
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:30,581
Really?

739
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:04,341
<i>Olé!</i>

740
00:48:20,232 --> 00:48:22,568
- So, should we get out of here?
- Yeah, time to go.

741
00:48:23,402 --> 00:48:27,823
That was amazing!
Wait a second. Did we even pay our tab?

742
00:48:27,907 --> 00:48:29,283
It doesn't matter!

743
00:48:29,366 --> 00:48:31,368
Watch this, watch this.
I always wanted to do this.

744
00:48:35,039 --> 00:48:37,917
- Get 'em!
- See ya, suckers!

745
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,170
I can't say for sure,
but I think they liked me.

746
00:48:42,463 --> 00:48:44,381
Come on! Don't let 'em get away!

747
00:48:45,883 --> 00:48:47,968
- Oh, yes!
- Yeah!

748
00:48:48,052 --> 00:48:49,386
- Yes!
- Ouch!

749
00:48:49,470 --> 00:48:52,056
- He got you pretty good.
- I'm all right. I've been hit harder.

750
00:48:52,139 --> 00:48:54,058
Did you see how much toilet paper I used?

751
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:57,228
The next person that goes into that
bathroom will have nothing to wipe with!

752
00:48:58,354 --> 00:49:00,564
The floors were sticky.
The crowd was rough.

753
00:49:00,648 --> 00:49:02,149
And the odds were against us.

754
00:49:02,233 --> 00:49:05,528
But there was no stopping
Donut Lord and the Blue Blur.

755
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:07,571
Scratch another one off my list.

756
00:49:09,073 --> 00:49:11,367
You are a weird little dude.

757
00:49:19,416 --> 00:49:20,417
Mmm.

758
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:21,501
Mmm.

759
00:49:21,544 --> 00:49:22,711
Mmm.

760
00:49:22,795 --> 00:49:23,711
Mmm.

761
00:49:23,712 --> 00:49:24,712
Okay.

762
00:49:24,713 --> 00:49:25,965
So what are we gonna do now?

763
00:49:27,883 --> 00:49:31,011
I'm gonna pass out watching TV.
I think you should too.

764
00:49:31,095 --> 00:49:32,638
But this is my last night on Earth.

765
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,473
I want to soak up every last second.

766
00:49:34,557 --> 00:49:37,797
All right, well, anything you can find to
do in this room, you knock yourself out.

767
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:46,402
Good times.

768
00:49:48,362 --> 00:49:50,281
Oh, come on.

769
00:49:50,948 --> 00:49:52,783
That's awful. What did you eat?

770
00:49:52,867 --> 00:49:55,244
I think it's called a chili dog?

771
00:49:55,327 --> 00:49:57,830
You might want to check
your fur on that one, buddy.

772
00:49:59,248 --> 00:50:02,001
Hey. So, what's this next planet
you're supposed to go to like?

773
00:50:02,084 --> 00:50:04,420
It's no Earth, I can tell you that.

774
00:50:04,503 --> 00:50:08,257
There's no people, just breathable air
and giant mushrooms and stuff.

775
00:50:09,008 --> 00:50:10,509
Well, look at it this way.

776
00:50:10,968 --> 00:50:13,304
At least you won't be the only "fun-guy."

777
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:15,890
No. Don't ever do that again.

778
00:50:17,308 --> 00:50:18,893
I liked it.

779
00:50:20,769 --> 00:50:23,105
I'm really gonna miss this place.

780
00:50:23,189 --> 00:50:26,901
I know I have to leave Earth to be safe,
but what if Longclaw was wrong?

781
00:50:28,027 --> 00:50:30,029
Maybe I could have a life here.

782
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:37,119
All right. We should get some sleep.

783
00:50:38,412 --> 00:50:39,914
You sleep. Don't worry about me.

784
00:50:39,997 --> 00:50:43,167
I'm gonna stay up all night
enjoying Earth while I can.

785
00:50:43,834 --> 00:50:45,502
Sure, kid.

786
00:50:45,586 --> 00:50:47,755
As long as we're on the road by 8:00.

787
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:56,680
I ate a chili dog.
That's why my farts smell.

788
00:51:11,612 --> 00:51:16,367
<i>Thomas Wachowski, accused of committing
an act of domestic terrorism.</i>

789
00:51:16,450 --> 00:51:19,286
<i>Wachowski is considered
armed and dangerous.</i>

790
00:51:19,370 --> 00:51:21,247
<i>Any information regarding his whereabouts</i>

791
00:51:21,330 --> 00:51:24,083
<i>should be reported to
local authorities immediately.</i>

792
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:31,799
Did he say where he was going?

793
00:51:35,427 --> 00:51:37,930
Maybe. Maybe not.

794
00:51:38,889 --> 00:51:40,182
Like I'd ever tell you.

795
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,435
Stand down, Agent Stone.

796
00:51:43,519 --> 00:51:45,813
This well-meaning citizen
obviously doesn't understand

797
00:51:45,896 --> 00:51:47,189
the urgency of the matter.

798
00:51:50,109 --> 00:51:51,151
Really?

799
00:51:54,196 --> 00:51:56,573
Now that's
what I call good cop, bad cop.

800
00:51:58,117 --> 00:51:59,743
Hoy!

801
00:51:59,827 --> 00:52:01,537
Left yourself open.

802
00:52:04,123 --> 00:52:05,963
Judging by the quickest route
to San Francisco,

803
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,169
the approximate speed of their vehicle,
and local weather conditions...

804
00:52:10,796 --> 00:52:12,214
they should be...

805
00:52:13,048 --> 00:52:14,842
right about...

806
00:52:16,093 --> 00:52:17,428
here.

807
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:19,972
- That's brilliant, sir.
- Thanks...

808
00:52:20,055 --> 00:52:21,974
for nothing.

809
00:52:23,934 --> 00:52:26,520
- So, what's on your bucket list?
- Who, me?

810
00:52:26,603 --> 00:52:28,203
Yeah. Everyone has a bucket list, right?

811
00:52:28,272 --> 00:52:31,692
Sure, but... I mean,
you're the one leaving Earth, and...

812
00:52:31,775 --> 00:52:33,360
I'm not planning on dying anytime soon.

813
00:52:33,444 --> 00:52:34,903
Don't be so sure.

814
00:52:34,987 --> 00:52:36,780
Your best friend is a magnet for danger.

815
00:52:36,864 --> 00:52:38,866
Are you anointing yourself as the bestie?

816
00:52:38,949 --> 00:52:40,200
Mm-hmm.

817
00:52:40,284 --> 00:52:42,661
A little presumptuous,
but... I mean... What, no...

818
00:52:42,745 --> 00:52:46,457
I like you, of course, but,
you know, we're not best friends.

819
00:52:47,207 --> 00:52:49,084
You tucked me in last night.

820
00:52:49,168 --> 00:52:50,794
Fine, fine, fine. Best animal friend.

821
00:52:50,878 --> 00:52:52,629
- That would be my dog, Ozzy.
- Okay.

822
00:52:52,713 --> 00:52:56,175
Let's drop this increasingly humiliating
topic of conversation.

823
00:52:56,258 --> 00:52:57,968
Bucket list. Give it to me!

824
00:52:58,719 --> 00:53:00,596
Okay, there is one thing.

825
00:53:01,555 --> 00:53:03,682
In Green Hills, I've always felt,

826
00:53:03,766 --> 00:53:07,061
I don't know, more like a babysitter
than a real cop, you know?

827
00:53:07,144 --> 00:53:10,064
So I want a chance to prove myself,
under real pressure.

828
00:53:10,147 --> 00:53:13,400
I'm gonna move to San Francisco,
become a street cop.

829
00:53:13,484 --> 00:53:15,986
And, I don't know,
see if I have what it takes.

830
00:53:17,112 --> 00:53:18,113
What?

831
00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:20,991
Why... Why is your face doing that?

832
00:53:21,075 --> 00:53:23,035
You're leaving Green Hills?

833
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:24,787
Okay.

834
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:27,623
B-B-But why?
Why would you leave Green Hills?

835
00:53:27,706 --> 00:53:30,352
This may be hard for you to understand,
but Green Hills is a small town.

836
00:53:30,376 --> 00:53:31,585
It's a very small town.

837
00:53:31,668 --> 00:53:34,505
Uh, it's not small.
There are hundreds of people.

838
00:53:34,588 --> 00:53:36,006
That's a small town, dude!

839
00:53:36,090 --> 00:53:38,926
It's a perfect town,
and the people need you.

840
00:53:39,009 --> 00:53:42,388
Please. I clean out their gutters.
I jump-start their cars in the winter.

841
00:53:42,470 --> 00:53:43,865
They could call anybody to do that.

842
00:53:43,889 --> 00:53:46,475
Sure, they can call anybody,
but they don't.

843
00:53:46,558 --> 00:53:47,935
They call you.

844
00:54:03,450 --> 00:54:07,454
Eeny, meeny, miny...

845
00:54:08,372 --> 00:54:09,456
mayhem.

846
00:54:21,135 --> 00:54:22,904
- You're not making any sense.
- Would you calm down?

847
00:54:22,928 --> 00:54:25,556
You come from a great town
with great people and, by my count,

848
00:54:25,639 --> 00:54:27,558
zero bad guys trying to kill you!

849
00:54:30,018 --> 00:54:32,563
Besides, what could possibly
be more important

850
00:54:32,646 --> 00:54:34,398
than protecting the people you care about?

851
00:54:41,029 --> 00:54:43,031
- Look, I get your poi...
- Whoa!

852
00:54:44,408 --> 00:54:45,659
Yeah!

853
00:54:52,958 --> 00:54:54,960
You know what? I was wrong about you.

854
00:54:55,043 --> 00:54:56,795
You're not the Donut Lord at all.

855
00:54:56,879 --> 00:54:58,589
You're more like the Jerk Lord.

856
00:54:58,672 --> 00:55:01,049
Have you noticed the harpoon
stuck in our dash?

857
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:08,098
Sonic!

858
00:55:08,182 --> 00:55:09,892
I was forced from my home.

859
00:55:09,975 --> 00:55:12,102
Your home is perfect,
and you're leaving it.

860
00:55:12,186 --> 00:55:13,955
Why would you do that?

861
00:55:13,979 --> 00:55:16,565
- Your body!
- Oh, no, not again!

862
00:55:16,648 --> 00:55:17,691
Hey! Hold on!

863
00:55:17,774 --> 00:55:19,526
- Why?
- Because I'm gonna do this.

864
00:55:38,378 --> 00:55:39,671
Sonic!

865
00:55:40,756 --> 00:55:42,049
Sonic!

866
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:48,680
Guess I had a bonus life.

867
00:55:50,807 --> 00:55:52,601
Oh, yeah, baby!

868
00:55:52,684 --> 00:55:55,938
Sonic, one. Big Tank, zero. I'm sorry.

869
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:58,315
- Did we get that on camera?
- How are you not dead?

870
00:55:58,398 --> 00:56:00,108
I have no idea.

871
00:56:00,192 --> 00:56:02,402
- Do you see me dancing?
- Yes, I saw you dance.

872
00:56:02,486 --> 00:56:03,946
Is that all you got?

873
00:56:04,029 --> 00:56:05,948
No, but thank you for asking.

874
00:56:09,243 --> 00:56:12,371
- Uh-oh.
- Sonic! Get back in the truck!

875
00:56:12,454 --> 00:56:14,331
You go. I'll catch up.

876
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:19,545
Ha!

877
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:27,594
I think that tank just had a baby.

878
00:56:40,148 --> 00:56:41,191
Incoming!

879
00:56:43,735 --> 00:56:46,446
- It's my turn!
- You just had one. It's mine!

880
00:56:46,530 --> 00:56:48,615
Hey, stop fighting
or I'm taking that thing away!

881
00:56:48,699 --> 00:56:49,741
Yeah, right, Dad.

882
00:57:01,628 --> 00:57:02,629
Where are you going?

883
00:57:02,713 --> 00:57:05,465
Just drive the car.
I'll take care of this.

884
00:57:05,549 --> 00:57:07,426
And if I don't make it, just ditch me.

885
00:57:07,509 --> 00:57:08,760
You seem good at that.

886
00:57:18,729 --> 00:57:20,772
<i>Hey, everyone!
Welcome back to my livestream.</i>

887
00:57:20,856 --> 00:57:21,958
<i>Today we're destroying robots.</i>

888
00:57:21,982 --> 00:57:23,650
Step one.

889
00:57:27,863 --> 00:57:29,906
Yes, we did it!

890
00:57:34,453 --> 00:57:37,080
We did not do it. Who <i>is</i> this guy?

891
00:57:37,164 --> 00:57:39,708
Ever wonder where
your tax dollars are going?

892
00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:40,834
My turn.

893
00:57:40,917 --> 00:57:43,837
Here, just keep us going straight.
I put it in cruise control.

894
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:45,672
I feel just like Vin Diesel.

895
00:57:45,756 --> 00:57:47,591
"It's all about family, Tom."

896
00:57:53,889 --> 00:57:55,807
Quick suggestion.

897
00:57:55,890 --> 00:57:58,769
Roll up into a ball
and smash him with your body.

898
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:02,189
Whoa! Where'd you learn how to drive?

899
00:58:02,272 --> 00:58:04,691
Here. In this truck.
It's happening as we speak.

900
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:09,988
I can't reach it. Bring him in closer.

901
00:58:10,072 --> 00:58:12,532
- What?
- Bring it in closer! Hit the brakes.

902
00:58:12,616 --> 00:58:13,825
Oh, you mean this one?

903
00:58:13,909 --> 00:58:15,661
The other brakes!

904
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,047
Ha-ha! Whoo!

905
00:58:28,090 --> 00:58:29,966
Oh!

906
00:58:30,050 --> 00:58:33,345
Give me a big, fat break!

907
00:58:38,725 --> 00:58:41,436
Aw, this one is cute. Let's keep him.

908
00:58:42,813 --> 00:58:43,814
Aah!

909
00:58:44,648 --> 00:58:46,024
Oh, come on!

910
00:58:46,108 --> 00:58:48,610
How could something
so adorable be so terrible?

911
00:58:51,822 --> 00:58:53,240
You've got car insurance, right?

912
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:01,373
Buzz off.

913
00:59:01,456 --> 00:59:03,083
That doesn't sound good.

914
00:59:03,166 --> 00:59:05,502
- No, beeping is bad. Get rid of it!
- I'm trying.

915
00:59:05,585 --> 00:59:07,337
Throw it out the win... Throw it anywhere!

916
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:09,715
- I can't get it off.
- All right, I'm pulling over.

917
00:59:17,723 --> 00:59:19,516
- Did I get it?
- Nope.

918
00:59:20,767 --> 00:59:22,227
Here. Hold still.

919
00:59:23,478 --> 00:59:25,397
It's going, it's going...

920
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:27,691
It's still here.

921
00:59:30,110 --> 00:59:31,153
Get off me.

922
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:33,196
Ha-ha! Nailed it!

923
00:59:42,706 --> 00:59:44,040
Sonic!

924
00:59:51,465 --> 00:59:52,632
No, no, no, no, no.

925
00:59:59,556 --> 01:00:03,477
Hey. Come on. You're all right.
Wake up. Wake up.

926
01:00:10,567 --> 01:00:11,902
Did we get 'em?

927
01:00:12,527 --> 01:00:14,613
Oh. No, there they are.

928
01:00:14,696 --> 01:00:17,199
They are real survivors, those two.

929
01:00:22,370 --> 01:00:23,705
Can we have a moment?

930
01:00:26,666 --> 01:00:28,084
Pin yourself to the wall.

931
01:00:29,503 --> 01:00:31,797
You know, I won't miss you
when you're gone.

932
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:35,759
Human beings are unreliable and stupid,
and I care very little about them.

933
01:00:35,842 --> 01:00:38,553
But my machines are diligent, relentless.

934
01:00:38,637 --> 01:00:40,472
They're everything to me!

935
01:00:42,432 --> 01:00:43,642
Huh?

936
01:01:03,703 --> 01:01:04,746
Mmm?

937
01:01:18,343 --> 01:01:19,845
Come on, buddy.

938
01:01:19,928 --> 01:01:22,305
You're gonna be all right.
You'll be all right.

939
01:01:27,810 --> 01:01:29,020
- Is Maddie here?
- No, no.

940
01:01:29,104 --> 01:01:30,498
- Not today. Goodbye.
- It's an emergency!

941
01:01:30,522 --> 01:01:32,482
- Bye-bye.
- Rachel, stop! Please! Maddie!

942
01:01:32,566 --> 01:01:34,067
Don't do this. This is important.

943
01:01:34,150 --> 01:01:36,295
- Oh, my God! Rachel, let him in.
- I am calling the police.

944
01:01:36,319 --> 01:01:38,530
No, I am calling the FBI.
I am calling the CIA.

945
01:01:38,613 --> 01:01:40,466
- Stop. Don't do that.
- I am calling your mother.

946
01:01:40,490 --> 01:01:42,158
- Okay, got it.
- Maddie, can we talk?

947
01:01:42,242 --> 01:01:43,242
Tom, what's going on?

948
01:01:43,243 --> 01:01:45,346
You're all over the news.
I've been trying to call you.

949
01:01:45,370 --> 01:01:47,139
I had to ditch my phone
so they couldn't track me.

950
01:01:47,163 --> 01:01:48,582
- Ditch his phone?
- Track you?

951
01:01:48,665 --> 01:01:51,084
- Uncle Tommy!
- Jojo! Hey!

952
01:01:51,167 --> 01:01:53,670
Now your niece is an accessory to treason.

953
01:01:53,753 --> 01:01:55,273
- No, she's not.
- Would you calm down?

954
01:01:55,338 --> 01:01:57,340
Calm down? I will not calm down!

955
01:01:57,424 --> 01:01:59,050
- Enough.
- Yes, calm down. Stop talking.

956
01:01:59,134 --> 01:02:01,303
No. Ozzy, please. Good to see you too.

957
01:02:01,386 --> 01:02:04,180
Oh, little Lord Baby Jesus.

958
01:02:04,264 --> 01:02:05,557
What is that, Tom?

959
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:07,017
Is that plutonium? Is it e-mails?

960
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:08,810
Yes, it's plutonium.

961
01:02:08,894 --> 01:02:10,694
Can we please go in
the other room and talk...

962
01:02:10,729 --> 01:02:11,938
Stop it, Ozzy. Quit it!

963
01:02:12,022 --> 01:02:13,542
This is why I told you he was no good.

964
01:02:13,607 --> 01:02:15,984
- I'm not engaging.
- No, Ozzy, quit it.

965
01:02:18,028 --> 01:02:20,196
Ozzy, no! Ozzy, no!

966
01:02:21,406 --> 01:02:23,700
Oh, catch me, Jojo.

967
01:02:23,783 --> 01:02:26,286
Oh, thank God.

968
01:02:26,369 --> 01:02:29,581
Can I get a glass of water?

969
01:04:10,682 --> 01:04:13,685
I just thought you might like a latte
with steamed Austrian goat milk.

970
01:04:14,602 --> 01:04:16,521
Who do I look like, an imbecile?

971
01:04:16,604 --> 01:04:19,816
Of course I want a latte.
I love the way you make them!

972
01:04:26,656 --> 01:04:28,992
Ready the prototype.

973
01:04:29,075 --> 01:04:30,827
With this kind of power,

974
01:04:30,910 --> 01:04:34,831
my machines can finally reach
their full potential.

975
01:04:41,337 --> 01:04:43,006
He's gonna be okay, Jojo.

976
01:04:44,299 --> 01:04:47,093
Oh, thank God. He's gonna be okay, right?

977
01:04:47,177 --> 01:04:49,679
I'm a vet, Tom. I don't even know
what I'm looking at here.

978
01:04:49,763 --> 01:04:51,890
He's a hedgehog. Or so he says.

979
01:04:51,973 --> 01:04:53,641
- It talks?
- Almost constantly.

980
01:04:54,392 --> 01:04:56,352
Okay.

981
01:04:56,978 --> 01:04:58,271
- Holy...
- What?

982
01:04:58,354 --> 01:04:59,814
His pulse is super-fast.

983
01:04:59,898 --> 01:05:01,733
That actually might be normal for him.

984
01:05:01,816 --> 01:05:03,456
I don't know. You gotta help him, Maddie.

985
01:05:03,526 --> 01:05:05,278
I don't know his physiology.

986
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:07,906
He doesn't seem to have any broken bones.

987
01:05:07,989 --> 01:05:10,200
He's just really banged up.

988
01:05:11,743 --> 01:05:14,704
Oh, look at his poor little feet.

989
01:05:17,957 --> 01:05:20,543
Hang in there, buddy.
You're gonna be all right.

990
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:26,341
Jojo? Untie your mother. Jojo!

991
01:05:26,424 --> 01:05:28,510
Untie Mommy.

992
01:05:28,593 --> 01:05:30,720
Sweetie. Jojo!

993
01:05:34,015 --> 01:05:35,451
I have to go to the bathroom.

994
01:05:35,475 --> 01:05:37,602
- He's gonna be okay, right?
- Uh...

995
01:05:37,685 --> 01:05:39,604
He'll snap out of this.
He'll wake up soon?

996
01:05:40,230 --> 01:05:41,356
Oh, smelling salts!

997
01:05:41,439 --> 01:05:44,818
Don't you have, like, vet smelling salts,
like, for cats or parakeets or something?

998
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:48,321
- No. They don't make cat smelling salts.
- They should.

999
01:05:48,404 --> 01:05:52,575
I have human smelling salts
in my human first aid kit.

1000
01:05:53,993 --> 01:05:55,203
Okay.

1001
01:05:57,205 --> 01:05:58,641
- Here we go.
- Come on, buddy.

1002
01:05:58,665 --> 01:05:59,916
Gotta go fast!

1003
01:06:02,877 --> 01:06:04,671
Whoa. Where am I? What year is it?

1004
01:06:04,754 --> 01:06:06,089
Is The Rock president?

1005
01:06:06,172 --> 01:06:07,566
Whoa, buddy, you're okay. Calm down.

1006
01:06:07,590 --> 01:06:08,800
Oh, hi, Pretzel Lady!

1007
01:06:08,883 --> 01:06:10,343
Hi.

1008
01:06:11,094 --> 01:06:12,512
- Tom?
- Yeah.

1009
01:06:12,595 --> 01:06:13,763
Can I talk to you, please?

1010
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:19,269
Space hedgehog, stay there. Try to rest.

1011
01:06:19,352 --> 01:06:20,937
You got it. I am great at resting.

1012
01:06:21,020 --> 01:06:23,020
I rest faster than anybody.

1013
01:06:23,064 --> 01:06:24,065
Still talking.

1014
01:06:24,149 --> 01:06:25,942
Uh, first of all, can we take a moment

1015
01:06:26,025 --> 01:06:27,735
to acknowledge how
under control I've been?

1016
01:06:27,819 --> 01:06:29,529
- Amazing.
- Didn't freak out.

1017
01:06:29,612 --> 01:06:31,948
- No.
- Totally calm.

1018
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:34,242
- Thank you.
- Ahh.

1019
01:06:34,325 --> 01:06:36,452
Second of all...

1020
01:06:36,536 --> 01:06:39,372
What the heck is going on?
Is that thing an alien?

1021
01:06:39,455 --> 01:06:43,209
Okay, so, remember how Crazy Carl
is always going on about the blue devil?

1022
01:06:43,293 --> 01:06:44,711
The blue devil!

1023
01:06:44,794 --> 01:06:46,921
- That's him? He's real?
- Yeah.

1024
01:06:47,005 --> 01:06:48,965
What is he doing here?
What are you doing here?

1025
01:06:49,048 --> 01:06:53,469
I... kinda sorta... shot our
little blue friend with your tranq gun.

1026
01:06:53,553 --> 01:06:56,097
- No, you did not.
- I didn't mean to.

1027
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:58,141
Okay. This is kinda hard
for me to explain.

1028
01:06:58,224 --> 01:06:59,976
And it's gonna sound a little bit crazy.

1029
01:07:00,059 --> 01:07:02,228
He has to get to
the Transamerica building,

1030
01:07:02,312 --> 01:07:03,688
and I promised I'd take him.

1031
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:06,024
Uh-uh! Aliens?

1032
01:07:06,107 --> 01:07:08,568
Maddie, your husband's lost his mind.

1033
01:07:08,650 --> 01:07:10,653
Use this as an opportunity to leave him.

1034
01:07:10,737 --> 01:07:12,447
No one would judge you.

1035
01:07:17,368 --> 01:07:19,120
So you won't hurt your feet anymore.

1036
01:07:20,038 --> 01:07:21,706
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

1037
01:07:22,707 --> 01:07:24,542
No one's ever given me a gift before.

1038
01:07:25,543 --> 01:07:27,378
I gotta check that off my bucket list.

1039
01:07:37,305 --> 01:07:39,599
All right! Looking good!

1040
01:07:42,227 --> 01:07:43,478
Okay.

1041
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:46,064
You said you wanted to help
people in real trouble, right?

1042
01:07:47,023 --> 01:07:48,399
Well, that's what you're doing.

1043
01:07:48,483 --> 01:07:51,986
Blue alien hedgehogs
still count as people. Right?

1044
01:07:52,070 --> 01:07:53,363
- I think so too.
- Yeah.

1045
01:07:53,446 --> 01:07:54,656
- I think.
- Okay.

1046
01:07:54,739 --> 01:07:56,908
I love you. Did I tell you that already?

1047
01:07:56,990 --> 01:07:58,826
I don't deserve you. You know that?

1048
01:07:58,910 --> 01:08:00,203
I know that.

1049
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:07,252
So, you're supposed to be Tom's
best friend that he won't shut up about.

1050
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:10,546
Well, I don't see the appeal.

1051
01:08:11,839 --> 01:08:13,967
Stop!

1052
01:08:14,050 --> 01:08:16,261
That is very gross.

1053
01:08:17,679 --> 01:08:18,888
- Hey.
- Hey.

1054
01:08:18,972 --> 01:08:22,183
So, my truck still runs,
but it's pretty much totaled.

1055
01:08:22,267 --> 01:08:24,328
You think your sister would mind
if we borrowed her car?

1056
01:08:24,352 --> 01:08:25,937
You have got to be kidding me!

1057
01:08:27,230 --> 01:08:28,582
- She'll be fine.
- Yeah, let's do that.

1058
01:08:28,606 --> 01:08:29,899
Mm-hmm.

1059
01:08:29,983 --> 01:08:32,277
This is my house!

1060
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:34,487
Coming through!

1061
01:08:34,570 --> 01:08:37,573
Whoa, whoa! Now this is my turn,
and I go around you.

1062
01:08:37,657 --> 01:08:40,743
Sorry! And... perfect park.

1063
01:08:40,827 --> 01:08:43,138
- What are you, crazy?
- Is there anything you didn't hit?

1064
01:08:43,162 --> 01:08:44,872
Why did we let the alien drive?

1065
01:08:44,956 --> 01:08:47,917
Hey, I got us here.
And please, five stars.

1066
01:08:49,585 --> 01:08:52,964
- So, this is it?
- That's it. That's your pyramid.

1067
01:08:53,047 --> 01:08:55,133
Wow, look at that thing!

1068
01:08:55,216 --> 01:08:56,384
What happens now?

1069
01:08:57,260 --> 01:08:59,887
- Oh. He's... gone.
- Yep.

1070
01:09:01,222 --> 01:09:03,599
No good. You need a special key
to get to the roof.

1071
01:09:04,642 --> 01:09:05,977
What now?

1072
01:09:06,602 --> 01:09:09,397
Time for me to abuse
the power entrusted to me.

1073
01:09:19,615 --> 01:09:20,825
We got a jumper on the roof.

1074
01:09:20,908 --> 01:09:23,788
Gotta get up there fast or we're gonna
have a human pancake on our hands.

1075
01:09:24,287 --> 01:09:26,080
You came all the way from Montana.

1076
01:09:27,290 --> 01:09:28,916
Yeah. That's how serious it is.

1077
01:09:33,796 --> 01:09:34,797
Okay.

1078
01:09:36,674 --> 01:09:38,009
You just saved a life.

1079
01:09:46,893 --> 01:09:49,479
How much longer?
I can't breathe in here.

1080
01:09:51,647 --> 01:09:54,108
Hello? Anybody there?

1081
01:09:54,192 --> 01:09:56,944
- Do you have your child in that bag?
- No.

1082
01:09:57,695 --> 01:10:00,156
I mean, yes, it's a child,
but it's not mine.

1083
01:10:01,282 --> 01:10:02,283
It's not your child.

1084
01:10:02,950 --> 01:10:04,869
Relax. I'm a cop, okay?

1085
01:10:04,952 --> 01:10:06,472
Plus, he likes it in there,
don't you, buddy?

1086
01:10:06,496 --> 01:10:07,997
Why would I like it in here?

1087
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:10,917
This is worse than the dog cage
you had me in earlier.

1088
01:10:12,043 --> 01:10:14,837
Such a kidder.

1089
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:17,340
- Okay.
- No, I'm scared of the dark!

1090
01:10:17,965 --> 01:10:19,300
Is anybody there?

1091
01:10:31,229 --> 01:10:34,399
What were you
keeping in this bag?

1092
01:10:34,482 --> 01:10:36,025
A jar of pickled farts?

1093
01:10:36,109 --> 01:10:37,610
All right. What are we looking for?

1094
01:10:40,863 --> 01:10:42,281
This.

1095
01:10:43,116 --> 01:10:45,076
Okay. What happens now?

1096
01:10:45,159 --> 01:10:46,994
Now all I have to do
is think of where I want

1097
01:10:47,078 --> 01:10:49,205
the other end of the ring
to appear, and I throw it.

1098
01:10:49,288 --> 01:10:51,332
So that's it? We did it?

1099
01:10:51,416 --> 01:10:52,750
Yeah. We did it!

1100
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:57,046
Hey. Sorry we didn't get to do
everything on your bucket list, pal.

1101
01:10:57,130 --> 01:10:59,841
It's okay.
I did the ones I needed the most.

1102
01:10:59,924 --> 01:11:03,302
You two are so cute.

1103
01:11:03,386 --> 01:11:05,638
- Oh, please. What?
- We are not.

1104
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:07,056
No. We're not cute.

1105
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:09,809
We are a couple of loose cannons
just living by our own rules.

1106
01:11:09,892 --> 01:11:10,893
Exactly.

1107
01:11:10,977 --> 01:11:12,162
- Really?
- Yeah.

1108
01:11:12,186 --> 01:11:14,939
And our rules include
expressing heartfelt emotions.

1109
01:11:15,022 --> 01:11:16,441
If you say so.

1110
01:11:16,524 --> 01:11:18,943
- Okay, then.
- All right.

1111
01:11:20,153 --> 01:11:22,131
- Um, you gotta go, right?
- Yeah, I gotta go.

1112
01:11:22,155 --> 01:11:23,406
I gotta go. We gotta go too.

1113
01:11:23,489 --> 01:11:25,074
See... All right, bye-bye.

1114
01:11:29,787 --> 01:11:31,581
Just one more thing.

1115
01:11:39,464 --> 01:11:41,549
I'm sorry I was so hard on you.

1116
01:11:44,343 --> 01:11:47,430
I know it's a tough decision
for you to leave Green Hills.

1117
01:11:47,513 --> 01:11:51,934
Walking away from something
you care about has to be painful.

1118
01:11:52,018 --> 01:11:54,061
You're not sure
you really want to go, huh?

1119
01:11:55,354 --> 01:11:58,691
I don't want to go, but I can't stay.

1120
01:11:58,774 --> 01:12:01,277
As long as I'm here,
I put everyone in danger.

1121
01:12:01,903 --> 01:12:03,404
I can't do that.

1122
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:08,367
I just want you to know that
these last two days have been

1123
01:12:08,450 --> 01:12:10,995
the best two days of my life.

1124
01:12:14,248 --> 01:12:15,808
You know, I never thought I'd say this,

1125
01:12:15,833 --> 01:12:18,419
but I'm actually gonna miss you,
you little blue devil.

1126
01:12:18,503 --> 01:12:20,213
I'll miss you too, Donut Lord.

1127
01:12:21,255 --> 01:12:22,256
Thank you.

1128
01:12:22,924 --> 01:12:23,925
For what?

1129
01:12:24,926 --> 01:12:26,385
For saving my life.

1130
01:12:44,445 --> 01:12:47,240
Okay. Did someone leave
their "Find My Phone" on?

1131
01:13:14,016 --> 01:13:16,644
Welcome to San Francisco, Mr. Wachowski.

1132
01:13:17,728 --> 01:13:19,522
Are you enjoying the clam chowder?

1133
01:13:19,605 --> 01:13:21,833
It's the government wackjob
who keeps trying to kill us.

1134
01:13:21,857 --> 01:13:23,317
Unsuccessfully!

1135
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:25,321
Nice of you to swing by
on your way to Comic-Con.

1136
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:26,571
Yeah, what are you wearing?

1137
01:13:28,739 --> 01:13:33,077
It's a flight suit, designed to modulate
my body temperature and reduce drag.

1138
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:34,745
Yeah, and yet you still are one.

1139
01:13:34,829 --> 01:13:36,622
Ooh-hoo! Good one.

1140
01:13:36,706 --> 01:13:38,666
You are catching fire, Thomas.

1141
01:13:38,749 --> 01:13:41,127
Oh, and speaking of heat,
I see you've taken a lover.

1142
01:13:41,669 --> 01:13:42,837
Does she have a name

1143
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:45,339
or should we just call her
"collateral damage"?

1144
01:13:45,423 --> 01:13:46,549
Hey, watch your mouth.

1145
01:13:46,632 --> 01:13:49,010
Unless you want a little more
of what I gave you earlier?

1146
01:13:49,093 --> 01:13:50,553
I punched him in the face.

1147
01:13:50,636 --> 01:13:52,888
Oh! He punched him right in the face!
It was awesome!

1148
01:13:52,972 --> 01:13:55,891
The time for talking is over!
It's time to push buttons.

1149
01:13:55,975 --> 01:13:59,145
Your flying eggs are pretty
impressive, Mr. Eggman,

1150
01:13:59,228 --> 01:14:01,522
but let's face it, you'll never catch me.

1151
01:14:01,606 --> 01:14:03,482
Confidence!

1152
01:14:03,566 --> 01:14:05,610
A fool's substitute for intelligence.

1153
01:14:13,492 --> 01:14:15,536
- That's not good.
- Uh...

1154
01:14:15,620 --> 01:14:18,789
Sonic, I know you got the super-speed
and everything, but Maddie and I...

1155
01:14:18,873 --> 01:14:20,684
Totally defenseless?
Probably gonna get blown up?

1156
01:14:20,708 --> 01:14:22,668
Pretty much, yeah.

1157
01:14:22,752 --> 01:14:25,338
Don't worry. I know exactly what to do.

1158
01:14:32,887 --> 01:14:35,014
I was not expecting that.

1159
01:14:35,097 --> 01:14:37,808
But I was expecting not to expect
something, so it doesn't count.

1160
01:15:20,559 --> 01:15:22,228
Pew, pew-pew-pew, pew-pew-pew-pew!

1161
01:15:26,315 --> 01:15:29,151
Oh!

1162
01:15:37,952 --> 01:15:39,245
Come on!

1163
01:15:39,995 --> 01:15:41,622
Come on, come on, come on.

1164
01:15:53,718 --> 01:15:56,137
Whoa, whoa, whoa! No, no, no!

1165
01:16:08,107 --> 01:16:09,775
Oh! Hi, Tom.

1166
01:16:09,859 --> 01:16:12,069
Glad you're here. Could use some help.

1167
01:16:12,153 --> 01:16:13,913
Old Bessie's about to give birth.

1168
01:16:13,988 --> 01:16:16,031
Give me a minute.

1169
01:16:16,699 --> 01:16:17,825
Aah.

1170
01:16:19,118 --> 01:16:22,371
Can I give you one genius piece of advice?

1171
01:16:22,830 --> 01:16:24,457
Don't run.

1172
01:16:24,540 --> 01:16:26,876
It'll only hurt more if you do.

1173
01:16:26,959 --> 01:16:29,253
And it's bad for your joints.
They've proved it.

1174
01:16:29,336 --> 01:16:31,672
All right, Eggman. You wanna get fast?

1175
01:16:31,756 --> 01:16:32,923
Let's get fast.

1176
01:16:36,177 --> 01:16:37,553
The hard way it is.

1177
01:16:56,780 --> 01:16:58,491
That was an illegal left, by the way.

1178
01:17:01,327 --> 01:17:03,287
<i>So, here we are again.</i>

1179
01:17:03,370 --> 01:17:05,080
<i>We've been through so much together.</i>

1180
01:17:05,164 --> 01:17:07,750
<i>Now you understand why there's
a psychotic robot doctor</i>

1181
01:17:07,833 --> 01:17:10,085
<i>chasing a supersonic blue hedgehog.</i>

1182
01:17:10,169 --> 01:17:12,755
<i>Want to know how it ends? Yeah, me too.</i>

1183
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:31,732
How is this possible?

1184
01:17:31,816 --> 01:17:33,901
No one's ever caught up to me before.

1185
01:17:41,700 --> 01:17:43,536
Coming through!

1186
01:17:43,619 --> 01:17:44,620
<i>Sacrebleu!</i>

1187
01:17:45,746 --> 01:17:47,915
<i>Excusez-moi, monsieur!</i>

1188
01:17:51,877 --> 01:17:54,129
Here we go. Room to open it up.

1189
01:18:03,389 --> 01:18:04,640
I can't lose him!

1190
01:18:18,946 --> 01:18:21,657
If you can't beat 'em, blind 'em.

1191
01:18:24,785 --> 01:18:26,829
Lost visual contact.

1192
01:18:31,876 --> 01:18:35,546
You're not allowed up there!
It's one of the Seven Wonders!

1193
01:18:59,862 --> 01:19:01,405
Get out of here!

1194
01:19:09,330 --> 01:19:12,583
You're an astonishing little creature.

1195
01:19:14,835 --> 01:19:17,087
It'll be fun to take you back to the lab

1196
01:19:17,170 --> 01:19:19,423
for a litany of invasive
exploratory procedures.

1197
01:19:20,382 --> 01:19:22,051
Any last words?

1198
01:19:23,010 --> 01:19:25,763
Guac. I like that word.

1199
01:19:27,556 --> 01:19:29,826
I don't have to tell you how
many scientific breakthroughs

1200
01:19:29,850 --> 01:19:32,227
have been made possible by animal testing.

1201
01:19:32,310 --> 01:19:33,395
You're being very selfish.

1202
01:19:33,479 --> 01:19:34,647
Going my way?

1203
01:19:34,730 --> 01:19:35,940
What the...

1204
01:19:41,362 --> 01:19:43,322
Who the hell do you think you are?

1205
01:19:46,659 --> 01:19:48,160
I'm the Donut Lord, you son of a...

1206
01:19:53,290 --> 01:19:55,000
Autopilot, adjust.

1207
01:19:55,750 --> 01:19:57,169
Why?

1208
01:19:57,252 --> 01:20:00,547
Why would you throw
your life away for this thing?

1209
01:20:00,630 --> 01:20:02,007
That's why I don't have friends.

1210
01:20:02,090 --> 01:20:04,176
Next thing you know,
you're somebody's best man.

1211
01:20:04,259 --> 01:20:05,820
They want to have the wedding out of town.

1212
01:20:05,844 --> 01:20:07,888
Like nobody has anything better to do!

1213
01:20:08,722 --> 01:20:10,766
Anyway, where were we?

1214
01:20:10,849 --> 01:20:13,394
Oh, yes. You were about to die.

1215
01:20:15,646 --> 01:20:17,356
That's our sheriff you're messing with.

1216
01:20:19,066 --> 01:20:21,068
And our blue devil...

1217
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:24,363
who, as everyone can see,
is a very real creature,

1218
01:20:24,446 --> 01:20:26,865
and not at all invented by me.

1219
01:20:29,493 --> 01:20:31,286
- Oh, careful.
- Just... Just put it away.

1220
01:20:31,370 --> 01:20:32,579
Tom?

1221
01:20:46,260 --> 01:20:48,178
I don't mean to be indelicate here,

1222
01:20:48,262 --> 01:20:51,682
but someone should get some ice,
keep the body fresh.

1223
01:20:54,685 --> 01:20:56,937
He's just a silly little alien.

1224
01:20:57,438 --> 01:20:58,856
He didn't belong here!

1225
01:21:01,066 --> 01:21:02,359
That little alien

1226
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:06,739
knew more about being human
than you ever will.

1227
01:21:07,406 --> 01:21:08,532
His name was Sonic.

1228
01:21:09,658 --> 01:21:10,868
This was his home.

1229
01:21:12,036 --> 01:21:13,370
And he was my friend.

1230
01:21:38,645 --> 01:21:39,772
He's all yours.

1231
01:21:41,523 --> 01:21:42,691
Everyone, get back!

1232
01:21:46,445 --> 01:21:49,114
I think you have something
that belongs to me.

1233
01:21:49,907 --> 01:21:50,908
Whoa.

1234
01:22:00,125 --> 01:22:02,002
This is my power.

1235
01:22:02,086 --> 01:22:04,671
And I'm not using it to run away anymore.

1236
01:22:04,755 --> 01:22:08,217
I'm using it to protect my friends.

1237
01:23:05,524 --> 01:23:07,651
Ooh! Now you've done it!

1238
01:23:07,734 --> 01:23:09,027
Guess what, Eggman?

1239
01:23:09,110 --> 01:23:11,655
I'm not leaving Earth. You are.

1240
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:13,574
Donut Lord?

1241
01:24:02,664 --> 01:24:04,958
- I told you, you got this.
- Hey, <i>we</i> got this.

1242
01:24:17,930 --> 01:24:20,010
- I think these belong to you.
- Thank you very much.

1243
01:24:21,433 --> 01:24:23,060
No more pushing people off of buildings.

1244
01:24:23,143 --> 01:24:24,645
You know I can't promise that.

1245
01:24:28,482 --> 01:24:31,235
- You did pretty good, space hog.
- Thanks, Donut Lord.

1246
01:24:31,318 --> 01:24:34,446
You're gonna have to explain
this "Donut Lord" thing.

1247
01:24:34,529 --> 01:24:37,366
Nope, sorry.
That's for me and the little guy. Right?

1248
01:24:37,449 --> 01:24:39,701
We got our thing,
you got your thing with your... sister.

1249
01:24:39,785 --> 01:24:40,786
Oh, my God, my sister.

1250
01:24:40,869 --> 01:24:45,582
Gotta go fast. Gotta go fast.
Gotta go fast. Gotta go fast.

1251
01:24:45,666 --> 01:24:47,292
Jojo, put on my Fitbit...

1252
01:24:48,377 --> 01:24:50,045
so I can at least get some steps.

1253
01:24:50,128 --> 01:24:51,463
We can never go back there.

1254
01:24:53,006 --> 01:24:54,383
I mean, are we?

1255
01:24:56,593 --> 01:24:58,762
'Cause it kind of feels like
we're home right now.

1256
01:24:59,596 --> 01:25:00,639
Really?

1257
01:25:02,349 --> 01:25:06,728
I kind of feel like I checked
the "save a life" box off my bucket list.

1258
01:25:09,314 --> 01:25:13,151
Now all I want to do is spend my life
with the people I care about.

1259
01:25:14,569 --> 01:25:15,821
I want to check that box.

1260
01:25:17,155 --> 01:25:18,865
Okay, I like that.

1261
01:25:19,574 --> 01:25:22,035
All right, everybody. Nothing to see here.

1262
01:25:22,119 --> 01:25:23,203
Let's disperse.

1263
01:25:23,287 --> 01:25:25,163
Just another ordinary day in Green Hills.

1264
01:25:25,247 --> 01:25:26,707
Carl, I'll take that chain saw.

1265
01:25:27,457 --> 01:25:29,251
Come on. Let's go!

1266
01:25:29,334 --> 01:25:30,877
You act like you've never seen a fight

1267
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:35,549
between an intergalactic space rodent
and a robot with a doctorate.

1268
01:25:44,725 --> 01:25:46,018
You got enough there?

1269
01:25:46,476 --> 01:25:48,603
- Yes, Mr. Manager.
- Need any more?

1270
01:25:48,687 --> 01:25:50,105
You get that away.

1271
01:26:00,740 --> 01:26:02,159
Mr. and Mrs. Wachowski?

1272
01:26:03,368 --> 01:26:04,369
Yes?

1273
01:26:06,705 --> 01:26:08,749
A token of appreciation
from your government,

1274
01:26:08,832 --> 01:26:11,877
for keeping quiet about recent incidents,
which never occurred.

1275
01:26:14,379 --> 01:26:16,089
Wow!

1276
01:26:16,173 --> 01:26:18,800
- Wonder what it is.
- Money to fix the house?

1277
01:26:18,884 --> 01:26:21,136
- Letter from the President?
- You'll see.

1278
01:26:21,219 --> 01:26:22,637
Okay.

1279
01:26:25,766 --> 01:26:27,851
- Olive Garden.
- Hmm, yeah.

1280
01:26:27,934 --> 01:26:30,395
The way you said "You'll see"
made me think

1281
01:26:30,479 --> 01:26:32,359
it was something better
than the things we said.

1282
01:26:32,397 --> 01:26:35,150
Have you tried their
Never Ending Pasta Bowl?

1283
01:26:35,233 --> 01:26:36,693
It never ends.

1284
01:26:36,777 --> 01:26:39,071
- That sounds... fancy.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

1285
01:26:39,154 --> 01:26:41,323
Well, thank you.
We appreciate the gesture.

1286
01:26:42,490 --> 01:26:45,369
Oh, hey. I guess we can close the file
on that Robotnik guy, huh?

1287
01:26:45,452 --> 01:26:46,453
Just disappeared.

1288
01:26:46,536 --> 01:26:51,083
I'm sorry, but no such person exists
or ever has existed.

1289
01:26:52,542 --> 01:26:53,752
I wish that were true.

1290
01:26:53,835 --> 01:26:55,396
You haven't by any chance been in contact

1291
01:26:55,420 --> 01:26:58,256
with a certain alien creature
since the incident, have you?

1292
01:26:58,340 --> 01:27:00,100
Uncle Sam would love
to have a chat with him.

1293
01:27:00,133 --> 01:27:02,552
Very casual. Brunch, perhaps.

1294
01:27:04,346 --> 01:27:05,531
Oh, you mean the little blue guy.

1295
01:27:05,555 --> 01:27:06,556
- Mmm.
- No.

1296
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:08,642
- No, nothing. No.
- Mm-mmm.

1297
01:27:08,725 --> 01:27:10,894
- Doubt we'll ever hear from him again.
- Mm-mmm.

1298
01:27:11,603 --> 01:27:12,979
Very well.

1299
01:27:13,563 --> 01:27:14,981
Okay.

1300
01:27:15,065 --> 01:27:16,608
- Thank you.
- Great.

1301
01:27:16,690 --> 01:27:17,776
Mmm.

1302
01:27:18,735 --> 01:27:19,736
Yep.

1303
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:25,409
To be honest,
I'm pretty pumped about the pasta bowl.

1304
01:27:26,576 --> 01:27:28,495
So, do you guys wanna
watch a movie or what?

1305
01:27:28,578 --> 01:27:29,931
Sorry, buddy, it's a school night.

1306
01:27:29,955 --> 01:27:31,474
It's time for you to go back to your cave.

1307
01:27:31,498 --> 01:27:33,625
What? It's 3:00 in the afternoon!

1308
01:27:33,708 --> 01:27:35,353
You know how you get
when you're tired. Come on.

1309
01:27:35,377 --> 01:27:36,878
Me? I'm not like anything.

1310
01:27:36,962 --> 01:27:40,173
- You guys are so uncool.
- Yeah, yeah, we know.

1311
01:27:40,257 --> 01:27:42,092
Hey, buddy, where you going?

1312
01:27:42,175 --> 01:27:43,695
You said I have to go back to my cave.

1313
01:27:44,386 --> 01:27:45,554
We did.

1314
01:28:00,444 --> 01:28:02,904
Oh, my... Are you kidding me?

1315
01:28:04,406 --> 01:28:05,824
I can't believe it.

1316
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:07,492
How did you...

1317
01:28:08,368 --> 01:28:10,454
It's... It's all here.

1318
01:28:20,672 --> 01:28:23,216
Look at this! Are you kidding?
And the beanbag?

1319
01:28:23,300 --> 01:28:25,302
No way!
How did you even get this?

1320
01:28:25,385 --> 01:28:28,013
And you got it all the way over...
Oh!

1321
01:28:28,096 --> 01:28:29,931
I love it, I love it,
I love it, I love it!

1322
01:28:32,809 --> 01:28:36,271
Well, welcome home.

1323
01:28:36,354 --> 01:28:38,899
Thank you, so much.

1324
01:28:47,990 --> 01:28:49,451
<i>Oh, no, you don't.</i>

1325
01:28:49,534 --> 01:28:52,287
<i>No second-best animal friends
allowed in my room.</i>

1326
01:28:52,370 --> 01:28:54,039
<i>Wait. What are you doing?</i>

1327
01:28:54,122 --> 01:28:56,458
<i>Stay away from me. Stop it!</i>

1328
01:28:56,540 --> 01:28:58,543
<i>I'm warning you. I've got nunchucks!</i>

1329
01:28:58,627 --> 01:29:01,129
<i>Hey, stop. Okay, you can stay.</i>

1330
01:29:18,313 --> 01:29:21,816
My grasp on sanity remains... absolute.

1331
01:29:23,568 --> 01:29:25,111
Isn't that right, Agent Stone?

1332
01:29:30,325 --> 01:29:32,452
Why don't you get a head start?

1333
01:29:34,538 --> 01:29:37,541
Do some rock-connaissance.

1334
01:29:37,624 --> 01:29:40,544
Rock-connaissance!
Come on! That's hilarious!

1335
01:29:40,627 --> 01:29:42,379
What's the matter with you?

1336
01:29:42,462 --> 01:29:45,674
Here's the sitch'. Uninhabited planet.

1337
01:29:47,259 --> 01:29:51,221
No resources, no supplies,
no apparent way home.

1338
01:29:53,765 --> 01:29:55,350
A lesser man would die here.

1339
01:29:58,645 --> 01:30:00,313
I'll be home by Christmas.

1340
01:30:19,958 --> 01:30:21,876
Rock-connaissance!

1341
01:30:25,046 --> 01:30:26,965
Come on! Cheer up!

1342
01:32:28,962 --> 01:32:31,423
If these readings are accurate, he's here.

1343
01:32:31,506 --> 01:32:32,799
I found him.

1344
01:32:32,882 --> 01:32:34,676
I just hope I'm not too late.
