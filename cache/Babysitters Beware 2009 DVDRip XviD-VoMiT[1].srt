Danny!
What's new, kidderoo?

18
00:02:53,225 --> 00:02:56,760
Hi, Janelle.
Client dinner?

Uh, betcha two bucks.

20

Mom and I have a client dinner.

Oh, Danny,
I forgot to tell you.

25
00:03:09,771 --> 00:03:11,205
I have to go with your dad
to a client dinner tonight.

26
00:03:11,205 --> 00:03:13,306
I'm really sorry,
sweetheart.

27
00:03:13,306 --> 00:03:14,608
You guys go out
every night.

28
00:03:14,608 --> 00:03:16,575
When do we get to
practice baseball?

I know it's a lot, Danny.

30

I'd rather be hanging out with
you, but I've got a job to do.

Hey, you know,
that's okay.

We're going to have
tons of fun.

Aren't we, Danny?

Sure.

35
00:03:26,884 --> 00:03:30,520
Hey, how about tomorrow after
work, you, me, and a baseball?

Hey, thanks for being
such a good kid.

42
00:03:42,895 --> 00:03:44,497
I don't know what we'd do
if you weren't.

43
00:03:45,797 --> 00:03:47,666
Hey, do you want to go up
and play with Iggy?

No. Your iguana
scares the poop out of me.

Maybe Janelle
could practice with you.

all these flower pots.

so is my friend Marco,

61
00:04:51,814 --> 00:04:53,614

00:04:53,614 --> 00:04:55,784

the tough love, pal.

What'd you play last year?

00:05:04,357 --> 00:05:05,524
Pitcher.

66
00:05:05,524 --> 00:05:06,658
Oh, pitcher's good,
isn't it?

67
00:05:06,658 --> 00:05:07,927
Not in T-ball.

68
00:05:07,927 --> 00:05:10,261
In T-ball,
the pitcher's just standing

69
00:05:10,261 --> 00:05:12,730
in the middle of the diamond,
scratching his butt.

70
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:17,466

I want to be on first base.

have to go out every night?

I never get to see him.

80

have to work.

81
00:05:42,985 --> 00:05:44,120
At least you got me.

82
00:05:45,154 --> 00:05:47,223
But I try to be good.

83
00:05:48,424 --> 00:05:50,491
That doesn't have
anything to do with it.

So do you think
we hurt Mr. Willowsbag?

Ah, no more than he hurts
his dog 500 times a day.

I sit for.

in a while never hurt anybody.

Oh, so adorable.

126
00:09:41,131 --> 00:09:42,800
There was--

127
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,200
There was leftover pizza, and
he wanted to call the food bank

128
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,470
and see if they needed it.

129
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,770
It was so cute.

130

Thank you so much,
Janelle.

131
00:09:50,038 --> 00:09:52,041
Don't know
what we'd do without you.

132
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:58,779
What?

133
00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:03,249
Uh, I'm taking
an SAT prep class,

134
00:10:03,249 --> 00:10:05,816
so I'm not going
to be able to sit

135
00:10:05,816 --> 00:10:06,985
for the next couple
of weeks.

136
00:10:10,687 --> 00:10:12,689
Wow.

137
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:21,328
Danny is really
going to miss you.

138
00:10:21,328 --> 00:10:22,763
Ohh.

139
00:10:50,784 --> 00:10:52,585
Seems like the only time
I see him anymore,

140
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:54,587
he's already asleep.

141
00:11:00,224 --> 00:11:02,059
(Whispering)
That smile is so cute.

142
00:11:02,059 --> 00:11:03,594
Yeah.

143
00:11:08,531 --> 00:11:10,899
(Whispering)
Come on, let's go.

144
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:19,806
So did they
ever catch you?

145
00:11:19,806 --> 00:11:22,574
Not yet. I think
he thinks the dog did it.

146
00:11:22,574 --> 00:11:24,610
Too slow.

147
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:26,544
Can't throw.

148
00:11:26,544 --> 00:11:28,612
Girl.

149
00:11:28,612 --> 00:11:31,247
Hits like a girl.

150
00:11:28,612 --> 00:11:31,247
You hit like a girl.

151
00:11:31,247 --> 00:11:33,416
Pipsqueak and Porker, huh?

152
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:35,517
Put two of you together,
and you make one player.

153
00:11:35,517 --> 00:11:38,954
One really sucky player.

154
00:11:39,988 --> 00:11:41,857
Mouth Breather.
Special Ed.

155
00:11:41,857 --> 00:11:43,357
You smell,
but at least you can play.

156
00:11:43,357 --> 00:11:44,658
Right field.

157
00:11:44,658 --> 00:11:47,093
Sweet, dude.
We're gonna kick their butts.

158
00:11:47,093 --> 00:11:48,928
What a jerk.

159
00:11:48,928 --> 00:11:51,963
I hear Snook's been held back
every grade since kindergarten.

160
00:11:51,963 --> 00:11:52,998
You.

161
00:11:52,998 --> 00:11:54,866
How do you get held back
in kindergarten?

162
00:11:57,201 --> 00:11:59,102
You know, I've been thinking
about your babysitter problem.

163
00:11:59,102 --> 00:12:00,603
There's only
one solution.

164
00:12:00,603 --> 00:12:02,938
You have to get on
the no-sit list.

165
00:12:02,938 --> 00:12:04,673
What's the no-sit list?

166
00:12:04,673 --> 00:12:06,340
My cousin
told me about it.

167
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,242
If you're bad enough,
no babysitter will take you.

168
00:12:08,242 --> 00:12:09,744
They'll put you on the list.

169

00:22:25,507 --> 00:22:27,442
They're like
state secrets.

334
00:22:27,442 --> 00:22:29,477
Okay, so, what are we
going to do about Danny?

335
00:22:29,477 --> 00:22:32,578
No. What are you going to do
about Danny,

336
00:22:32,578 --> 00:22:34,547
Mister "No Excuses"?

337
00:22:39,317 --> 00:22:41,852
I think Danny and I are gonna be
playing some baseball tomorrow.

338
00:22:44,555 --> 00:22:45,655
Great throw!

339
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:48,991
Oh! All right.

340
00:22:48,991 --> 00:22:51,526
Bring the heat.

341
00:22:53,294 --> 00:22:55,129
Did Grandpa
teach you how to play?

342
00:22:57,364 --> 00:22:59,565
My dad never had a lot of time
to play baseball with me.

343
00:22:59,565 --> 00:23:02,035
Wow, just like me!

344
00:23:07,371 --> 00:23:08,939
Do grownups
hate baseball?

345
00:23:08,939 --> 00:23:11,708
Is that why they have to pay
the pros so much money to play?

346
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:14,443
Buddy, if I could spend all my
time playing baseball with you,

347
00:23:14,443 --> 00:23:16,378
and still have a house
and food and everything,

348
00:23:16,378 --> 00:23:18,214
I'd be the happiest guy
in the world.

349
00:23:19,814 --> 00:23:21,482
Maybe we could be
on a team.

350
00:23:21,482 --> 00:23:24,218
If I were captain,
I would pick you first.

351
00:23:25,352 --> 00:23:26,419
So would I, Danny.

352
00:23:26,419 --> 00:23:28,253
But you know,
we already are a team.

353
00:23:28,253 --> 00:23:29,254
Really?

354
00:23:29,254 --> 00:23:31,055
Yeah.
You, me, and Mom.

355
00:23:31,055 --> 00:23:32,691
We're the Parker
family team.

356
00:23:32,691 --> 00:23:35,259
But your bad behaviour
is letting the team down.

357
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,362
Sorry, Dad.

358
00:23:39,762 --> 00:23:41,865
Being bad never gets you
what you want.

359
00:23:43,365 --> 00:23:45,667
Being bad totally gets you
whatever you want.

360
00:23:45,667 --> 00:23:47,268
I knew it!

361
00:23:47,268 --> 00:23:50,004
The day after
I drove my babysitter away,

362
00:23:50,004 --> 00:23:52,372
my dad came home early
to play baseball with me.

363
00:23:52,372 --> 00:23:54,839
So you gonna keep it up,
you know, get on the list?

364
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:56,275
It's working so far.

365
00:23:56,275 --> 00:23:59,577
But the only thing is,
I don't think I can be that bad.

366
00:23:59,577 --> 00:24:02,179
You got lucky with Miss Greene.
She's easy.

367
00:24:02,179 --> 00:24:04,882
I know, but how do you get good
at being bad?

368
00:24:06,683 --> 00:24:07,683
(Metal clanging)

369
00:24:07,683 --> 00:24:09,485
(Car alarm blaring)

370
00:24:19,025 --> 00:24:20,460
Yeah.

371
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:26,398

You.

374
00:24:29,133 --> 00:24:31,101
Danny needs some help.

375
00:24:31,101 --> 00:24:33,002
Oh, I'll help you,
all right.

376
00:24:33,002 --> 00:24:34,805
We need some lessons
in how to be bad,

377
00:24:34,805 --> 00:24:36,238
and you're the best
worst kid I know.

378
00:24:36,238 --> 00:24:38,274
You wanna be bad?

379
00:24:38,274 --> 00:24:41,041
Danny needs to learn how to be,
you know, a total jerk,

380
00:24:41,041 --> 00:24:43,309
just like you.

381
00:24:43,309 --> 00:24:45,512
What's in it for me?

382
00:24:45,512 --> 00:24:47,980
Well, I've got two dollars,
six Pokémon cards,

383
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,848
and my pudding cup
from lunch.

384
00:24:49,848 --> 00:24:51,150
That's a
pretty good deal.

385
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:52,384
Yeah. I could just
watch you be a jerk for free,

386
00:24:52,384 --> 00:24:53,384
but I'm in a hurry.

387
00:24:53,384 --> 00:24:55,518
What's your rush?

388
00:24:55,518 --> 00:24:56,720
I wanna be
on the no-sit list.

389
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,021
You know,
for babysitters?

390
00:24:58,021 --> 00:25:01,757
I invented
the no-sit list.

391
00:25:01,757 --> 00:25:04,092
It's great.
You get to stay home alone,

392
00:25:04,092 --> 00:25:06,495
sometimes
for a couple of days.

393
00:25:07,496 --> 00:25:08,563
So you'll help me out?

394
00:25:14,233 --> 00:25:15,469
You're gonna love it.

395
00:25:18,771 --> 00:25:20,305
SNOOK:
The first sitters are easy.

396
00:25:20,305 --> 00:25:24,173
Just stick with the classics
like, you know, water balloons.

397
00:25:24,173 --> 00:25:28,510
Hmm, what about
yoghurt balloons?

You've gotta mix it up though.
Keep trying new things.

(Danny screaming)

403
00:26:16,547 --> 00:26:19,449
After a while, they start
bringing in the tough sitters,

404
00:26:19,449 --> 00:26:22,318
and then you have to fight back
with all you've got.

405

Not hot sauce!

How's the test prep going?

410

Ugh.
"E: all of the above."

411

That's my answer
for everything.

412
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:24,265
Hey, kidderoo.

413
00:27:24,265 --> 00:27:25,899
Hi, Janelle.

414
00:27:25,899 --> 00:27:28,869
Oh, orange juice. Can you watch
the cart for a second, sweetie?

415
00:27:28,869 --> 00:27:30,836
I'll stay with him.

416
00:27:28,869 --> 00:27:30,836
Okay. Thank you.

417
00:27:30,836 --> 00:27:35,207
So I heard some rumours
about you.

418
00:27:36,374 --> 00:27:38,576
About me?

419
00:27:36,374 --> 00:27:38,576
Mm-hm.

Here.

Here you go,
in case you run out.

422
00:27:48,182 --> 00:27:49,616
Does it ring a bell?

423
00:27:49,616 --> 00:27:51,452
Who, me?
I'm a good kid.

424
00:27:51,452 --> 00:27:52,553
Too good.
Remember?

425
00:27:52,553 --> 00:27:55,154
Yeah, I remember.

426
00:27:55,154 --> 00:27:58,156
Just be careful, you don't want
to end up on the no-sit list!

(Gasping)

428
00:27:59,158 --> 00:28:01,658
Oh, okay.

429
00:28:01,658 --> 00:28:03,995
I know what kind of kid you are,
and in your heart,

430
00:28:03,995 --> 00:28:06,096
you're too good
to ever really be bad.

431
00:28:10,098 --> 00:28:13,502
(Cheering)

432
00:28:13,502 --> 00:28:14,802
You're legendary.

433
00:28:14,802 --> 00:28:16,303
Did you really
drop yoghurt balloons?

434
00:28:16,303 --> 00:28:17,739
That's awesome.

435
00:28:17,739 --> 00:28:19,906
If I bought a fake hand
my mom would freak.

436
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:21,974
Danny's probably on
the no-sit list already.

437
00:28:21,974 --> 00:28:23,042
Not so fast.

438
00:28:23,042 --> 00:28:25,044
(All gasping)

439
00:28:25,044 --> 00:28:26,511
You've done okay so far.

440
00:28:26,511 --> 00:28:29,181
He scared them all off.

441
00:28:29,181 --> 00:28:31,415
But that just means that
the good sitters won't take you.

442
00:28:31,415 --> 00:28:33,050
You can still get
The Guard.

The Guard?

445
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:35,518
Who's that?

446
00:28:35,518 --> 00:28:37,954
He used to work in a prison
with killer and thieves,

447
00:28:37,954 --> 00:28:40,188
so you can bet
that no kid scares him.

448
00:28:40,188 --> 00:28:41,757
He's bad?

449
00:28:41,757 --> 00:28:43,191
The worst babysitter
I ever had.

450
00:28:43,191 --> 00:28:46,826
Forget about TV or games,
you just sit in your room alone.

451
00:28:46,826 --> 00:28:49,929
At dinner time, he slides
a plate under the door.

452
00:28:49,929 --> 00:28:52,364
It's always
a bread sandwich.

453
00:28:52,364 --> 00:28:55,599
One slice of bread
between two other slices.

454
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:58,435
Maybe he's already heard about
Danny, and he won't sit for him.

455
00:28:58,435 --> 00:28:59,503
He'll sit for anybody.

And if you can't
drive him off,

you're stuck with him

gonna help us out, Danny.

661
00:41:17,124 --> 00:41:19,026
The team, remember?

662
00:41:19,026 --> 00:41:21,728
Why are we only a team when
you want me to do something

663
00:41:21,728 --> 00:41:23,595
and not when I want to?

664
00:41:23,595 --> 00:41:25,330
Danny, you used to be
such a good boy,

665
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:27,032
and now all you do
is drive away your babysitters.

666
00:41:27,032 --> 00:41:28,566
What happened?

667
00:41:28,566 --> 00:41:30,935
Does that mean no one
will baby-sit for me anymore?

668
00:41:30,935 --> 00:41:32,135
No, it means
you made me miss

669
00:41:32,135 --> 00:41:33,937
a very important meeting
tonight, son.

670
00:41:33,937 --> 00:41:35,671
Sorry.

671
00:41:33,937 --> 00:41:35,671
No, you will be sorry.

672
00:41:35,671 --> 00:41:37,106
Marco's birthday
is tomorrow, right?

673
00:41:37,106 --> 00:41:38,507
After school.

674
00:41:38,507 --> 00:41:39,775
Yeah, you looking
forward to that?

675
00:41:39,775 --> 00:41:41,076
Yeah.

676
00:41:39,775 --> 00:41:41,076
Well, you won't be there.

677
00:41:41,076 --> 00:41:42,811
You made me miss something
important to me tonight,

678
00:41:42,811 --> 00:41:45,146
now I'm gonna make you miss
something important to you.

679
00:41:45,146 --> 00:41:47,814
I wish
I was important to you.

680
00:41:58,489 --> 00:42:00,691
I'm starving.
We didn't even get an appetiser.

681
00:42:06,295 --> 00:42:08,196
Did you have to take away
Marco's party?

682
00:42:10,364 --> 00:42:12,733
Okay, let's let him
go to Marco's party.

683
00:42:12,733 --> 00:42:14,568
In fact,
why don't we get him a pony

684
00:42:14,568 --> 00:42:16,202
and a trip to the waterslides
while we're at it.

685
00:42:16,202 --> 00:42:17,904
Jim.

686
00:42:17,904 --> 00:42:19,105
Why is he acting up, Wendy?

687
00:42:19,105 --> 00:42:21,339
I mean,
he's got a great house,

688
00:42:21,339 --> 00:42:22,707
he's got all the toys
in the world.

689
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:26,042
He wants
to spend time with you.

690
00:42:26,042 --> 00:42:28,144
How long
is this phase gonna last?

691
00:42:28,144 --> 00:42:31,381
Until he stops
wanting to spend time with you.

692
00:42:31,381 --> 00:42:32,747
Which,
the way children are,

693
00:42:32,747 --> 00:42:34,249
is probably
not that far from now,

694
00:42:34,249 --> 00:42:36,851
so you ought to
spend some time with him,

695
00:42:36,851 --> 00:42:38,319
while he still
lets you hang around.

696
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:41,255
I want to, but then he goes
and does something like this.

697
00:42:41,255 --> 00:42:43,390
Now I'm gonna have to work
twice as hard to make up for it.

698
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:44,389
He's only
making it harder.

699
00:42:44,389 --> 00:42:46,258
I know,
but Marco's birthday?

700
00:42:46,258 --> 00:42:49,360
He's been looking
forward to that for a year.

701
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,462
Do you really want to reward him
for his bad behaviour?

702
00:42:51,462 --> 00:42:54,198
No, I don't.

703
00:42:54,198 --> 00:42:57,534
But he's gonna be crushed, and
I don't even wanna think about

704
00:42:57,534 --> 00:43:00,002
how Marco's
gonna take the news.

705
00:43:00,002 --> 00:43:01,837
You can't come
to my birthday party?!

706
00:43:01,837 --> 00:43:03,171
I'm grounded.

707
00:43:03,171 --> 00:43:04,404
It's today!

708
00:43:04,404 --> 00:43:06,273
Isn't there a rule
that you can't back out

709
00:43:06,273 --> 00:43:07,708
on someone's birthday?

710
00:43:07,708 --> 00:43:09,175
I know,
but I'm grounded.

711
00:43:09,175 --> 00:43:10,943
But I did get rid
of The Guard.

712
00:43:10,943 --> 00:43:12,710
It was really tough.

713
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:14,580
First I tried
to get him with a--

714
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:16,281
What's wrong?

715
00:43:16,281 --> 00:43:18,816
It's not like there were gonna
be that many kids there anyway.

716
00:43:20,217 --> 00:43:22,519
Wait till I tell you
about The Guard's motorcycle.

717
00:43:22,519 --> 00:43:24,153
Who cares how
you got rid of The Guard?

718
00:43:24,153 --> 00:43:26,922
You're supposed to be coming
to my birthday party, Danny!

719
00:43:26,922 --> 00:43:28,290
I want to.

720
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:30,758
You don't really.

721
00:43:30,758 --> 00:43:32,993
You just care about
getting on the stupid list.

722
00:43:32,993 --> 00:43:34,327
You told me
about the list.

723
00:43:34,327 --> 00:43:35,862
That was back
when we were friends.

724
00:43:35,862 --> 00:43:36,995
We're best friends.

725
00:43:36,995 --> 00:43:37,996
Danny, a best friend
is supposed to

726
00:43:37,996 --> 00:43:39,131
come to
your birthday party.

727
00:43:39,131 --> 00:43:40,499
If you're not
gonna be there,

728
00:43:40,499 --> 00:43:42,734
I guess that means
we aren't best friends anymore.

729
00:43:45,669 --> 00:43:48,372
My mom even made
volcano cake!

Okay, great.
I'll talk to you later.

00:44:14,557 --> 00:44:16,560
Do you want
more milk, honey?

No.

736
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,902
I know that you're missing
your best friend's birthday.

He's not
my best friend anymore.

I'm pretty sure that Marco
is still your best friend.

739
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:43,079
Bad behaviour
has consequences, Danny.

740
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:45,248
And learning that is
one of the most important parts

741
00:44:45,248 --> 00:44:48,017
of growing up.

742
00:44:48,017 --> 00:44:51,052
But the people who care
about you don't just go away.

Can I go up to my room?

Yes, if you want.

745
00:44:56,423 --> 00:44:58,658
I've got some more work

Yeah.

All I could think about today
was Danny missing that party.

He's pretty
broken-up about it.

You ruined
my son's birthday!

I feel like
all we ever talk about anymore

796
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:39,335
is why you're being bad
to your babysitters.

You were
such a good boy, Danny.

I know that you're not
this bad in your heart.

I'm concerned, Daniel.

800

Up until now, you've only
been bad for babysitters,

801
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,209
but you deliberately
disobeyed us.

Don't you have anything

When do we get to do something

We were gonna
do something tomorrow.

Really? What?

812
00:50:03,921 --> 00:50:05,222
We were gonna go to
a baseball game.

813
00:50:05,222 --> 00:50:07,457
I told my clients
that instead of

814
00:50:07,457 --> 00:50:08,992
going to some
dumb restaurant for dinner,

815
00:50:08,992 --> 00:50:11,226
that we should take our families
out to a baseball game.

816

That's great, Dad.

817

We were
gonna do that, Danny,

818
00:50:14,795 --> 00:50:16,230
and then you snuck
out of the house today.

819
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:17,331
So now you can't go?

820
00:50:17,331 --> 00:50:19,466
No.
Now you can't go.

821
00:50:19,466 --> 00:50:20,667
I've already committed,

822
00:50:20,667 --> 00:50:22,067
so I have to go.

823
00:50:22,067 --> 00:50:24,604
You're going to
a baseball game without me?

824
00:50:27,238 --> 00:50:28,573
I have to.

825
00:50:28,573 --> 00:50:30,173
I can't reward you
for breaking the rules,

826
00:50:30,173 --> 00:50:31,742
and I can't back out
on my client.

827
00:50:31,742 --> 00:50:33,476
Not after leaving them at
the restaurant the other night.

828
00:50:33,476 --> 00:50:35,010
But you can't go.

829
00:50:35,010 --> 00:50:36,746
No one else
will baby-sit for me.

830
00:50:36,746 --> 00:50:37,979
I called around.

831
00:50:37,979 --> 00:50:39,982
There is still someone
who will baby-sit for you.

832
00:50:43,684 --> 00:50:44,985
The first star.

833
00:50:44,985 --> 00:50:46,318
Huh?

834
00:50:46,318 --> 00:50:48,121
"The first star
I see tonight."

835
00:50:55,593 --> 00:50:56,728
JIM:
What do you know.

836
00:50:56,728 --> 00:50:57,829
DANNY:
Can we make a wish,

837
00:50:57,829 --> 00:50:59,362
like we used to?

838
00:50:59,362 --> 00:51:01,764
Of course we can.

839
00:51:01,764 --> 00:51:04,333
ALL:
Star light, star bright,

840
00:51:04,333 --> 00:51:07,268
first star
I've seen tonight,

841
00:51:07,268 --> 00:51:10,204
I wish I may,
I wish I might,

842
00:51:10,204 --> 00:51:13,140
have this wish
I wish tonight.

843
00:51:15,174 --> 00:51:18,310
I wish my son would be the
sweet little boy he used to be.

844
00:51:18,310 --> 00:51:21,380
I wish my parents cared about me
as much as their clients.

845
00:51:23,614 --> 00:51:24,815
I wish
my little boy understood

846
00:51:24,815 --> 00:51:26,816
that everything we do
is for him.

847
00:51:56,739 --> 00:51:58,541
What are you doing?

848
00:51:58,541 --> 00:52:00,074
I didn't want
to get you in trouble

849
00:52:00,074 --> 00:52:02,577
if you're not allowed
to have friends over.

850
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:04,979
I thought
you weren't talking to me.

851
00:52:04,979 --> 00:52:06,279
I guess we're talking.

852
00:52:06,279 --> 00:52:09,582
I'm really sorry
I ruined your birthday, Marco.

853
00:52:09,582 --> 00:52:11,750
Ruined? That was
the best birthday ever!

854
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:14,653
I sneezed lava cake
out of my nose.

855
00:52:14,653 --> 00:52:15,853
So you forgive me?

856
00:52:15,853 --> 00:52:18,322
Of course I do.
You're my best friend.

857
00:52:18,322 --> 00:52:20,023
I don't think
my mom does though.

858
00:52:20,023 --> 00:52:23,191
She and my sisters
look like 99 Dalmatians.

859
00:52:23,191 --> 00:52:24,826
(Laughing)

860
00:52:24,826 --> 00:52:26,094
So you wanna come over?

861
00:52:26,094 --> 00:52:27,361
I got the Legend of Zelda,

862
00:52:27,361 --> 00:52:28,863
even though
it's rated "T" for "teen."

863
00:52:28,863 --> 00:52:33,367
I'm grounded forever. My parents
found another babysitter.

864
00:52:33,367 --> 00:52:35,167
No way! Who?

865
00:52:35,167 --> 00:52:37,637
I don't know. But if
he's worse than The Guard,

866
00:52:37,637 --> 00:52:39,403
I'm in big trouble.

867
00:52:39,403 --> 00:52:42,073
MOM:
Danny, are you
talking to someone?

868
00:52:42,073 --> 00:52:44,976
No one's talking to me,
remember?

869
00:52:45,976 --> 00:52:46,977
Hey, Mom,

870
00:52:46,977 --> 00:52:49,078
can I play a game
on your laptop?

871
00:52:49,078 --> 00:52:51,214
It's on the table.

872
00:52:51,214 --> 00:52:53,983
Send me a video chat.
We've gotta make a plan.

873
00:52:57,985 --> 00:52:59,320
So that's it.

874
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:01,088
You have to
drag this one off quick.

875
00:53:01,088 --> 00:53:03,488
If you can get rid of him
before the game starts,

876
00:53:03,488 --> 00:53:05,390
your dad will have to
come back for you.

877
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:07,292
And since he can't
back out on his client,

878
00:53:07,292 --> 00:53:09,326
he'll have to
bring me to the game.

879
00:53:09,326 --> 00:53:11,761
Are you positive
this is a good idea, Danny?

880
00:53:11,761 --> 00:53:13,397
Why not?

881
00:53:13,397 --> 00:53:16,131
Well, your babysitters just
keep getting worse and worse.

882
00:53:16,131 --> 00:53:18,801
And now I can't even
play with you anymore.

883
00:53:18,801 --> 00:53:20,435
Being bad
hasn't worked so well.

884
00:53:20,435 --> 00:53:23,004
And being good
didn't work at all.

885
00:53:23,004 --> 00:53:24,672
So, what are you gonna do?

886
00:53:26,239 --> 00:53:28,308
Well, all I know is,

887
00:53:28,308 --> 00:53:29,776
if this one's worse
than The Guard,

888
00:53:29,776 --> 00:53:31,110

You can't do it, Danny.

891
00:53:32,644 --> 00:53:36,146
But you have to be
the worst kid to baby-sit ever.

892
00:53:36,146 --> 00:53:37,515
And I have to do it quick.

893

Once the game starts,
it's too late.

894

This is for my family.

Um, studying for the SATs.

Danny, I'm not gonna do it.
Your dad has to work.

out there,

I'm sure they do, Danny.
They love you.

996

It's just,

Is everything okay?

1017
01:00:54,677 --> 01:00:56,679
Well...

Yeah, I'm still here. I think

Hi, Dad.

Hey, Danny.
What's going on, buddy?

1021
01:01:09,254 --> 01:01:11,790
Hi, Dad.
Are you doing Algebra?

1022
01:01:11,790 --> 01:01:14,758
Algebra?
Why do you ask about that?

1023
01:01:14,758 --> 01:01:16,594
I think it's something
that grownups do

1024
01:01:16,594 --> 01:01:18,494
that they can't
explain to kids, right?

1025
01:01:18,494 --> 01:01:21,264
I suppose so.

1026
01:01:21,264 --> 01:01:22,865
When you're gone
all the time,

1027
01:01:22,865 --> 01:01:26,166
is that for something that
grownups can't explain to kids?

1028
01:01:26,166 --> 01:01:28,769
That's exactly what it is.
Is something wrong?

1029
01:01:28,769 --> 01:01:32,339
I'm just really sorry
I've been acting bad, Dad.

1030
01:01:32,339 --> 01:01:35,707
It's just something that kids
can't explain to grownups.

1031
01:01:35,707 --> 01:01:36,843
Kind of like Pokémon.

You're coming with me.

1042

01:02:00,894 --> 01:02:02,160

No, Mom's
still at the game.

I'm bringing my client,
so make a good impression, okay?
