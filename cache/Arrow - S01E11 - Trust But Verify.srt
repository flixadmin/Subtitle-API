1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,368
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,803
For five years, I was stranded
on an island with only one goal:

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,965
Survive.

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,406
Oliver Queen is alive.

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,847
Now, I will fulfill my
father's dying wish...

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,241
...to use the list of names he left me...

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,971
...and bring down those
who are poisoning my city.

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,682
To do this,
I must become someone else.

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,167
I must become something else.

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,731
Previously on Arrow:

11
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,082
You told me to stay away
from your family.

12
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,211
But your family isn't staying away from me
which means something must be done.

13
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,362
Where can I find the man
in this picture?

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,126
Do you not think it convenient
you captured me easily?

15
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,645
Run!

16
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,920
Do you even know
what this island really is?

17
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:00,529
It's a prison.
What would you do in my position?

18
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,204
Whatever you're listening to,
it ain't music.

19
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,001
- There ought to be a law.
- Well, there's not. So...

20
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,162
Yo, watch it.

21
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,885
Hey, he's got a gun.

22
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,370
Tahitian Green or Midnight Black?

23
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,142
What do you think?

24
00:02:22,167 --> 00:02:24,328
I think that you've been
dropping hints all week, Thea.

25
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,400
Mom still isn't buying you
a car for your birthday.

26
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,240
- I could not have said it better myself.
- Oliver got a car when he turned 18.

27
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,722
Yeah, but I could back it out
of the driveway without hitting a tree.

28
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,730
Well, that's true, but I do remember you taking
the paint off the side of your dad's Maserati.

29
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,161
- Hmm.
- Thea, the party planner's waiting.

30
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,084
Sorry to run off like this.

31
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,208
But we have a convertible to go buy.

32
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,681
- Good luck.
- Yes.

33
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,606
- How's she holding up?
- Oh, she's okay.

34
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,127
Thea thinks she's actually
a little bit too okay.

35
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,044
- What do you mean?
- Just...

36
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,647
...behaving erratically. Shut-in one
minute, running the company the next.

37
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,963
Her husband is missing
and presumed who-knows-what.

38
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,964
If anyone had an excuse to be erratic,
it's your mom.

39
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,447
That's what I told Thea.

40
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:11,322
Department's got the same comment about this
heist as it did the other two. No comment.

41
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,047
S.C.P.D. may not be willing
to go on the record...

42
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,329
...but traffic cameras got the entire heist
in this exclusive.

43
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,608
Shortly after 1 a.m.,
three masked robbers...

44
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,088
...approached the armored vehicle
after launching what appears...

45
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,811
That's why you keep
all your money offshore.

46
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,247
One of the guards was
pronounced dead on the scene.

47
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,641
The other died en route
to Starling General.

48
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,007
Their identities have not yet
been released.

49
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,684
With all the guys working up top, you
might wanna think about a side entrance...

50
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,845
- ...for your, uh, Arrowcave.
- Unh!

51
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,767
Just put one in. South alleyway.
Ah. There's something I wanna show you.

52
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,440
You're finally getting into online dating
and you need help with your profile.

53
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,967
Not exactly.
But there's somebody I'd like to meet.

54
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,207
Yeah, I read about this.
Third truck to get hit this month.

55
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,408
I saw it on the news this morning.

56
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,245
Couldn't figure out
why it seemed so familiar.

57
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,131
Then I remembered this. Kandahar, '09.

58
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,726
When the Marines took out
a Taliban transport vehicle.

59
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,644
Yeah. Well, there's a reason...

60
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,850
...why that looks similar. These guys are running
the same swarming technique. Where'd you find this?

61
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,322
I was researching someone. Bodyguard
who works for a private security firm.

62
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,690
Blackhawk Squad Protection Group.
His name is Ted Gaynor.

63
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,640
Oliver, Ted Gaynor was my commanding
officer on my first tour in Afghanistan.

64
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,602
Dig, I'm sorry...

65
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,761
...but Gaynor's on the list.

66
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,201
Gaynor's a few hundred thousand
dollars short of making your list.

67
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,761
Well, I never said it was just
1 percenters, did I?

68
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:49,528
This guy saved my life.
Received a commendation for it.

69
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,371
I don't care what your book says,
he's not a stick-up man.

70
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,609
- You haven't known him in a long time, Diggle.
- We both kept in contact...

71
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,000
...with each other since we got stateside.

72
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,925
Six months ago,
he even offered me a job at Blackhawk.

73
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,208
Now trust me, you don't know
this man like I do.

74
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,564
I know in Afghanistan his training specialty
was M32 multiple grenade launchers.

75
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,802
The exact same weapon used
in these heists.

76
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,203
And not exactly something that you find
at your local sporting goods store.

77
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,523
Two months ago we found out
this wasn't even your father's book.

78
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,321
Written by whoever hired the other archer.
Doesn't that kinda beg the question...

79
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,929
- ...what else you could be wrong about?
- I can be wrong. The list isn't.

80
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,085
Now, I'm gonna have a pointed
conversation with Mr. Gaynor tonight.

81
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,810
We'll see what he has to say about it.

82
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,924
I understand
if you wanna take the week off.

83
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,844
Yeah, well, thank you.

84
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,681
Sir.

85
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,244
Different day, same slop.

86
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,922
- You new?
- Yeah.

87
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,682
Don't worry. Took me a year
to find my way around the island.

88
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,566
Well, hey, hey, hey.

89
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,009
I'm supposed to be transporting
a prisoner.

90
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,242
Chinese guy who wears a green hood?

91
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,761
Sounds like the guy
they took to the east camp.

92
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,241
I'm heading over that way.
You can hitch a ride.

93
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,883
Let's go, come on.

94
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:23,125
Hold up, hold up. Unit one, two.

95
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,409
That wall over there
still has to be taped and textured.

96
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,571
I need you to grout the hallway floor as
soon as they're done with the tile install.

97
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,641
All right.

98
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,888
- Yeah.
- Hey, Tommy.

99
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,044
- Dad, I am really busy.
- Tommy, I know things have been...

100
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,129
...well, strained between us since...

101
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,760
Since you cut me off
and told me that I was a loser?

102
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,571
I was just trying
to jolt you into adulthood.

103
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,485
And look at you now.
You've got your first job, heh.

104
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,847
My tough love worked.

105
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,490
What do you want, Dad?

106
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,603
Nothing more than to share a meal
with my son.

107
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,926
Dinner, tomorrow night?

108
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,287
- Laurel and I have plans.
- Bring her along.

109
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,365
I think it's time I got to know her
a little better. Tommy...

110
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,282
...I've said some pretty hurtful things
and I regret them.

111
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,691
But you're still my son...

112
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,969
...and I still want
what I've always wanted.

113
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,769
For us to be close.

114
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,605
Let me check with Laurel
and I'll get back to you.

115
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,289
Ted Gaynor, we're gonna
have a conversation.

116
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,968
You make a move, go for a gun,
anything and things will end badly for you.

117
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,368
Put the bow down.

118
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,047
It's all clear. You okay?

119
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,005
Uh, yeah.

120
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:08,402
Well, I gotta talk to my boss
but after what I just saw...

121
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,006
...I'd say you're as good as hired.

122
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,401
Hell of a job interview, Ted.

123
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,291
Usually the vigilante
only goes after rich schmucks.

124
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,330
Any reason why he would change
his MO for you?

125
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,121
You've known me a long time, John.
What do you think?

126
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,407
I think he made a mistake.

127
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,322
Got the wrong guy.

128
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,642
I could've shot you, killed you.

129
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,201
- What the hell were you thinking?
- I'm not gonna let you William Tell...

130
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,522
- ...an innocent man.
- Gaynor isn't innocent, Diggle.

131
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,961
You seem to think that mainly
because of your damn book...

132
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,726
- ...which you apparently trust more than you trust me.
- I trust my father.

133
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,209
And he explained to me that every name
on that list has a reason to be there.

134
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,365
You took that book off your father's
dead body. How could he be so chatty?

135
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,085
A few years ago, I found a message
he left me explaining the list.

136
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,925
Oliver, how is that possible?
You were on a deserted island.

137
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,004
I didn't say that I found it on the island.

138
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,768
Diggle, for the past four months,
I've lied to...

139
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:22,561
...hurt and hid things
from all the people that I care about.

140
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,601
Do you really think that I would
do all this if I wasn't sure?

141
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,126
Oliver, listen,
Gaynor got me into Blackhawk.

142
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,282
And I'm gonna prove he's innocent.

143
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,007
And if he's isn't?

144
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,168
You owe me that.

145
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,286
You owe me at least that.

146
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,409
- Were you stationed by the perimeter?
- Yes.

147
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,565
- And your report?
- Everything's good, sir. No trouble.

148
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,566
- How long have you been stationed here?
- Uh, just arrived, sir.

149
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,123
Yes, you do seem rather green.

150
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,607
I don't recall the submarine bringing
in a phalanx of new troops lately.

151
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,849
Submarine?

152
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,810
I thought everybody came in
to the island on the plane.

153
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,082
Indeed they do.

154
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,040
I think you've tried on
every dress in the city.

155
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,247
Heh. Totally worth it.

156
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,766
My friends are gonna freak.

157
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,651
Yes, well, if your father were still alive,
he'd freak too.

158
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,882
Though in an entirely different way.

159
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,249
Heh, like when he saw what I was
wearing to my first boy-girl dance?

160
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:54,962
That poor boy you went with.
Oh, Robert scared him to death.

161
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,762
You know, Dad used to say his saddest
day would be when I turned 18.

162
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,443
Now he's gone
and I'm the one that's sad.

163
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,764
Ah, sorry.

164
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,411
I need to take this.

165
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,044
Hello?

166
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,209
Yes, I understand
but I'm with my daughter.

167
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,606
All right. I'll be there.

168
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,651
I thought you said we were gonna
spend the whole day together.

169
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,282
I know, but, uh...

170
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,728
...compliance needs to file
the 8K connected...

171
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,845
...to my assuming Walter's position
at the company and they can't wait.

172
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,250
I'm sorry.

173
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:54,042
- Is everything okay? You look worried.
- Not worried. Just...

174
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,043
My father called.

175
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,250
Oh.

176
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,686
- And how did that go?
- He invited us to dinner.

177
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,046
For tonight.

178
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,287
Oh.

179
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,841
Yeah. Apparently,
he wants to mend some fences.

180
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,685
But thanks to him, I can't afford a fence.

181
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,922
So I can only assume he's
got some other agenda.

182
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,043
Well, there's only one way to find out.

183
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,761
And maybe he really is trying to extend
an olive branch.

184
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,209
You really do look for the best in people,
don't you?

185
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,364
Lucky for you.

186
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,606
I'm sorry to have to pull you away
from your family like that.

187
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,000
What do you want, Malcolm?

188
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,527
We have a problem with your friend,
Carl Ballard.

189
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,169
He's trying to gentrify the Glades.

190
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,163
Carl knows that's not part of the plan.

191
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,570
Which is why you're gonna shut him down.
You're his friend. He'll listen to you.

192
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,811
You want me to help you with Carl,
I want something in return.

193
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,051
Proof Walter's still alive.

194
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,440
My word isn't enough?

195
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,965
What's that saying? "Trust, but verify"?

196
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,447
Words to live by.

197
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,970
Two days later,
I'm still digging regurgitated tacos...

198
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,681
...out of the car vents and he asks me
why I won't turn on the AC?

199
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,731
All right, you win.
Bodyguarding Queen was never that bad.

200
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,090
Six years serving my country, the only thing I'm
qualified for is babysitting spoiled brats.

201
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,004
Well Ted, they're not all like that.

202
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,004
I haven't met one yet
that would survive a single day in-country.

203
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,207
Hmm.

204
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,283
Sometimes it makes me wonder
what I was doing over there.

205
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,601
Specialty of the house.

206
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,323
- Thank you, Carly.
- Uh-uh, where is my cake?

207
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:59,121
No, tired of listening to you complain
about the cleaners shrinking your suits.

208
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,964
- Oh, yeah.
- Heh.

209
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:08,644
- She likes you.
- She's my sister-in-law, Ted.

210
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,044
Not anymore. Your brother's gone, John.

211
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,641
But you are here.

212
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,851
Car's waiting outside.

213
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,691
We got a client to drop off
at the shaking art gallery opening.

214
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,251
John, you remember Paul Knox?

215
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,404
He was a couple of ranks under us
back in the 'Stan.

216
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,962
Good to be working with you.

217
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,523
I'll be outside.

218
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,924
Didn't know Knox
worked at Blackhawk.

219
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,924
They recruited him
when his tour ended last month.

220
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,241
Mm-hm.

221
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,966
People change, John.

222
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,327
And everyone deserves
a chance to prove it.

223
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,803
- Knocking is not just a suggestion.
- I need to talk to you.

224
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:17,407
Thea, I'm not telling you
if Mom's getting you a car.

225
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,803
Heh, it's not about that.

226
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,885
Remember last week when I asked you
if you thought Mom was acting weird?

227
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,601
- Yep.
- Well, I found out why.

228
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,967
She's hooking up with Tommy's dad.

229
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:36,127
- That's insane.
- I just saw them together.

230
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,767
- It's happening all over again.
- What are you talking about?

231
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,647
Um...

232
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,570
A couple months
before you and Dad left on the Gambit...

233
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,644
- ...Mom and Dad were arguing a lot.
- About what?

234
00:17:53,840 --> 00:18:00,371
I don't know. But she was having a lot
of these lunch meetings with Mr. Merlyn.

235
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,885
And now Walter's gone too...

236
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,931
...and Mom and Mr. Merlyn
are back at it. It's gross.

237
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:11,681
Mom never would've cheated on Dad.
She's not cheating on Walter.

238
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:19,126
You don't wanna believe because you have
this perfect image of Mom in your head.

239
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:26,283
That's not who she is, Ollie.
She's a liar and a cheater.

240
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,369
And you really don't know her at all.

241
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,849
She thinks Malcolm and
I are having an affair?

242
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,082
And that it started back
when Dad was still alive.

243
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,244
- Why would she think that?
- She says you and Dad were fighting.

244
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,125
- Oh, dear God.
- Mom?

245
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:59,325
- It's not your concern, sweetheart.
- Thea made it my concern.

246
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,127
What was going on?

247
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:17,641
Robert was unfaithful to me.
Repeatedly.

248
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:23,245
It made our marriage difficult,
to say the least.

249
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:27,762
I'm sorry Oliver. But your father wasn't
always the man you thought he was.

250
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,645
I know you thought he walked on water.

251
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,565
But you see, that's how I wanted you
to remember him...

252
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,688
...as a good man who loved you.

253
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:41,370
That's how I want Thea to remember him.
So promise me you'll keep it a secret.

254
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,930
Of course.

255
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,046
- Mom?
- Yes?

256
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,647
Why would Thea think you and Mr. Meryln
are still sneaking around?

257
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,485
Well, I can't imagine.

258
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,050
Have you seen him lately?

259
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,209
Oliver.

260
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:10,088
He's been the CEO
of Merlyn Global Group for years.

261
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,801
I've been running
Queen Consolidated mere weeks.

262
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,282
Yes, I occasionally go
and ask for advice.

263
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,809
Is my interrogation over?

264
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,890
See, this is where we, uh...

265
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:49,686
...detain prisoners prone to running off
before I've finished with them.

266
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,330
Prisoners like you, Mr. Queen.

267
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:14,130
At Christmas one year,
Tommy wanted a puppy.

268
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,730
He wanted to name it Arthur,
as in King Arthur...

269
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,010
...because he's a Merlyn.

270
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:23,050
Heh. Well, you used to be
so incredibly adorable.

271
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,725
- I still am.
- Heh.

272
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,280
My wife would've liked you, Laurel.

273
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,931
I wish I would've known her.

274
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,447
She passed away
before Tommy and I became friends.

275
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,326
She was killed, Laurel.
There's no need to be polite about it.

276
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,443
You are just a ray of sunshine
today, aren't you Dad?

277
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,490
Please forgive me.
Talking about my wife has a tendency...

278
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,007
...to make me a little bit maudlin.

279
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,846
And here I was beginning
to think my days of being...

280
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,883
...Oliver Queen's personal computer
geek were coming to an end.

281
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,642
- Is that your way of saying you missed me?
- No, but if that works for you, go with it.

282
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,201
Heh. So a friend of mine is
running a scavenger hunt...

283
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,443
...and there's a case
of Lafite Rothschild 1982...

284
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,728
- ...waiting at the end.
- Oh, I love red wine.

285
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,362
But in order to find it,
I first need to get through this.

286
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,681
Hmm.

287
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,205
Security fob.

288
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,324
It's PIN protected.

289
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,166
Response goes back to a company called
Blackhawk Squad Protection Group.

290
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,561
Yeah, my friend had his
bodyguard set it up for him.

291
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,326
Personally, I think it's cheating,
but whatever.

292
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:41,166
This is a military-grade cryptographic
security protocol.

293
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:45,689
- Your friend really went to all this trouble?
- The idle rich are hard to entertain.

294
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:52,642
Listen, you get through it
and one of those bottles of wine is yours.

295
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,650
This has been lovely, Mr. Merlyn.
Thank you.

296
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,086
Thank you for joining me.

297
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,965
It's been wonderful
getting to know you better.

298
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,410
If Tommy doesn't mind me mixing
a little business with pleasure...

299
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,040
...I could use your signature on these.

300
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,889
You wanna shut down
Mom's free clinic?

301
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,681
- It's not hers anymore, Tommy.
- That clinic meant everything to Mom.

302
00:23:36,731 --> 00:23:37,731
You were 8 years old.

303
00:23:37,755 --> 00:23:41,188
I don't think you were in a position to
know what was important to your mother.

304
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,561
- I just need your signature...
Stop.

305
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,562
This dinner was never about
getting to know Laurel...

306
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,006
...it was about this.

307
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,041
You haven't changed
and you never will.

308
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:08,730
It's about time that I learn that
and stop letting you disappoint me.

309
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,089
We're leaving.

310
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,927
- This clinic was his mother's.
- Yes.

311
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,923
And his mother taught him
a lesson, I've been trying to...

312
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:24,163
...that the world is a harsh
and unforgiving place.

313
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,765
And when did she teach him that?

314
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,611
When she was lying dead in the street
with a bullet in her head.

315
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,209
Good night.

316
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,610
Management keeps things
running smooth, which is nice.

317
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,081
Better than going to war
with the army you got, right?

318
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,642
Heh. Indeed. Indeed.

319
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,209
So, Ted, are you the reason
Knox is working for Blackhawk?

320
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,284
Look, I know you don't like the guy.

321
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,966
I wasn't his biggest fan either.

322
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,169
But jobs are hard to come by
for everybody these days.

323
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,004
And guys like us?

324
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:09,369
When all anyone thinks you're qualified for
is shooting at people?

325
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,170
If I hadn't gotten Knox this job...

326
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:16,408
...chances are he'd be out knocking over
liquor stores or robbing banks.

327
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,440
- What'd you get?
- I think your friend's bodyguard...

328
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,130
- ...gave him the wrong security fob.
- Why?

329
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,124
Well, once I got past Blackhawk's
authentication system...

330
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:33,329
...there wasn't anything
about a scavenger hunt.

331
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,721
Just a directory and...

332
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:39,043
Well, I think you've stumbled onto
or gotten me to stumble onto...

333
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,567
- ...something pretty illegal.
- Define illegal.

334
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:46,203
Oh, you know, robbing an armored car
with grenade launchers and tear gas.

335
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,169
- What?
- Someone at Blackhawk...

336
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,607
...was using their system to store
detailed routes and schedules...

337
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,286
...for each of the city's
seven major armored car carriers.

338
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,397
Including the three that
already have been hit.

339
00:25:55,422 --> 00:25:58,072
Mr. Queen, I think we should provide
this information to police.

340
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,402
With it they should be able
to predict the next heist.

341
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,846
Hold on, Felicity.

342
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,765
I don't wanna get you in trouble
with my friends. Do me a favor.

343
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:08,686
Forward that directory on to me
and I'll get it to the police personally.

344
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,649
Thank you.

345
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,523
So no wine then?

346
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,287
Blake? Blake? Come on, man, come on.

347
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:18,282
- Blake is hit. He's hit!
- Come on, come on!

348
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,249
Go. Drive, drive, drive.

349
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,089
Oh, God, check it out. Check it out.

350
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,528
- Convertible. Oh, my God.
- You must be so surprised.

351
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:54,288
Isn't everything absolutely perfect?
Except for if Dad were here.

352
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,801
If Dad were here,
he'd say you look beautiful.

353
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,928
- Oh, excuse me a sec.
Mm-hm.

354
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,410
I heard the Hood foiled an
armored car heist this evening.

355
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,244
Gaynor wasn't running
the rocket launcher.

356
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,601
I know, I was with him the
whole time it was going down.

357
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,004
Looks like you were right.

358
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:22,528
Listen, if someone at Blackhawk is
involved, I'd put my money on Knox.

359
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,724
He started right before the heists began.
He has military training.

360
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,291
Okay, I injured one of them.

361
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,205
He was bleeding pretty badly
when they made off in their van.

362
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,170
Ok, so if any of Knox's blood is in
one of the motor pool vans...

363
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,161
- ...we'll know for sure.
- I'm going with you.

364
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,966
No, listen, you have this party
and I told you I would handle this.

365
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,942
If there is any problems,
you're just a phone call away.

366
00:28:41,967 --> 00:28:42,967
Hey.

367
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,410
Head on a swivel.

368
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,481
That's the way I was born, man.

369
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,126
- Happy birthday.
- Oh, thank you.

370
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:59,250
We have a special birthday gift for you.
It's called Vertigo.

371
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,482
Supposed to make you feel all floaty.

372
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,167
Ah, heh, if my morn caught me with this,
I wouldn't make it to 19.

373
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:08,210
I'm gonna go put it upstairs
and then I'll be right back down.

374
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,600
Moira, I have a little something for you.

375
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,851
Walter.

376
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:28,251
I did as you asked.
Now it's your turn to do as I asked.

377
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:32,644
- I'll take care of it.
- Thank you, Moira.

378
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:42,247
- At my party. Right here in front of me?
- No, Thea, you don't understand.

379
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:46,564
Walter hasn't been gone two months
and you're already cheating on him.

380
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:49,331
- Just like you did on Dad...
- No, I never cheated...

381
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:53,405
- Like I would believe anything you say.
- Thea. Thea.

382
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:58,128
I wish it had been you
that was on that boat.

383
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,561
I had a feeling you'd show up.

384
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,404
Yeah? Why is that, Knox?

385
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,450
Right after Gaynor got you hired,
someone hacked our system.

386
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,560
First person to ever make
it through our firewall.

387
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,725
- You wanna tell me how you did it?
- Not really sure.

388
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,281
- He didn't think you'd be very cooperative.
- Who?

389
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,841
Hey, John.

390
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,366
- Ted, you're part of this?
- No, not part of.

391
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,208
My men. My mission.

392
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,249
Mission?

393
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:43,564
- This isn't Afghanistan.
- Oh, don't I know that.

394
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:48,647
Over there, we were trusted with millions
of dollars in weapons and personnel.

395
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,207
We were conquerors.

396
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,284
And now? We're nannies with Tasers.

397
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:00,687
So that gives you the right to steal?

398
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:05,004
- To kill innocent civilians?
- I'm not gonna convince you I'm right.

399
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:09,006
- I am gonna convince you to join the team.
- Heh. Yeah, now I know you're crazy.

400
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,969
Early tonight was supposed to be
our last score. Because of the Hood...

401
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,009
...we struck out.

402
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:20,809
Now we're down a man. Good thing
you're qualified to take his place.

403
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,363
Ted, I think your convincing
is gonna have to be a lot more convincing.

404
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,929
Copy that. Cavanaugh.

405
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,567
Carly.

406
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,125
You son of a bitch.

407
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:43,563
- No, don't. Don't. Wait. Don't.
- Knox.

408
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:51,484
You both can die tonight, John.

409
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:55,804
Or once we do this, we're on a plane
and she can go home to your nephew.

410
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,928
It's your call.

411
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,727
Oh.

412
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,202
Come on, let's go. Ugh.

413
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,647
Oh, you shouldn't have done that, Dig.

414
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,882
Now you gotta watch us
kill your pretty little girlfriend.

415
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,243
- No, please don't.
- You're forgetting one thing, guys.

416
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,970
Oh, yeah? What's that?

417
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,646
I'm the one with the grenade launcher.

418
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,284
Carly, get out of there.

419
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,648
- Freeze!
- Oh.

420
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,884
Drop it, Ted.

421
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,565
Or I swear...

422
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,929
Don't posture.

423
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,607
You're not gonna do it.

424
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:55,962
You can't. I can see it in your eyes.

425
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,641
- You're late.
- You knew I was coming?

426
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,286
Next time you plant a bug
on someone, be more subtle about it.

427
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,247
- I wish you'd trusted me though.
- I trusted you.

428
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:35,446
But them, never.

429
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,762
You should get out of here.

430
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,689
John.

431
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,847
Carly, are you okay?

432
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:02,211
Turn around
and put your hands where I can see them.

433
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,043
Oh, Thea.

434
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,363
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

435
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,682
Just headachey, really.

436
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:53,485
- The car, is it...?
- The car isn't important right now.

437
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,244
Do you remember what happened,
sweetheart?

438
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,887
Just go away.

439
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:08,366
- Thea, please.
- I said, I'm fine.

440
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,602
Your father's even beginning
to call me now.

441
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,768
Don't waste your minutes.

442
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:33,081
Your father's a jerk,
but he's still your father.

443
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,922
I think, in his own way...

444
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:46,289
I think he sees himself
as protecting you somehow.

445
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:49,364
Yeah, he is really good
at using my dead mother...

446
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,522
...for an excuse for being a jerk.

447
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,204
You never talk about your mother.

448
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:00,006
I was only 8. I don't remember much
about what happened.

449
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,808
But after?

450
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:08,001
My father completely shut me out.

451
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,168
And then he went away.

452
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:22,363
He was gone for a year, maybe two.

453
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:29,210
I was 8 and he left me.
That is who my father is.

454
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,611
He only cares about himself.

455
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,209
- Cops give you a hard time?
- No.

456
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:57,251
I explained them that me and Gaynor were
old war buddies. He tried to rope me in...

457
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,809
When I refused, he kidnapped Carly,
everything else happened under duress.

458
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,648
I screwed up, Oliver.

459
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:17,048
Obviously Gaynor wasn't
who I thought he was.

460
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,408
I was wrong.

461
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:25,361
Yeah, but you were right too.

462
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:32,405
When you told me that I trusted the list
more than I trusted you.

463
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,365
Diggle, the truth is,
after what happened to me on the island...

464
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,886
...it's difficult for me to trust anything.

465
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,521
But you do.

466
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:55,009
And that reminded me
why I chose you as my partner.

467
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,404
It's because you see the best in people.

468
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,520
I learned something too.

469
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:41,685
Until you tell me, I don't ever wanna know
what other names are in this book.

470
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,928
She promised she's not cheating on Walter.

471
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,651
Like I would trust
anything that woman says.

472
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,768
Miss Queen? Thea Queen?

473
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:01,571
- Is there a problem?
- We received a call from your doctor.

474
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,939
In the event of a vehicular
accident, they are required

475
00:41:03,964 --> 00:41:05,880
to report the results of
the drivers tox-screen.

476
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:09,686
Ms. Queen tested positive
for a narcotic called Vertigo.

477
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,280
The drug they're using in the Glades?

478
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:16,411
Thea Queen, you are under arrest for
driving under the influence of narcotics.

479
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:28,122
Do you know why my men
wear balaclavas, Mr. Queen?

480
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,970
Because it masks everything
but the eyes.

481
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:37,170
And in a man's eyes,
one can always find the truth.

482
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,802
You risked everything
to save your friend.

483
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,406
Someone I warned you about...

484
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,046
...and yet you trusted him.

485
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,124
But that trust was misplaced.
