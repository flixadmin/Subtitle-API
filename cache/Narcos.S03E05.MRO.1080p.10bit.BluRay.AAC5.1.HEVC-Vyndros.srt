1
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:05,483
According to our intelligence,

2
00:01:05,608 --> 00:01:10,571
Gilberto Rodríguez was
a stabilizing influence on the cartel.

3
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:14,742
His arrest may lead
to an increased violence

4
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:17,953
against civilians and police.

5
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:19,413
No doubt...

6
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:25,586
...the cartel leaders are now in hiding,

7
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:30,549
and their security apparatus
is operating in a state of high alert.

8
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:34,637
So, the only thing
we can be certain of

9
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:37,890
is that any further operation
against the cartel

10
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:43,104
will be both very difficult
and extremely dangerous.

11
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:49,026
We appreciate the volatility
of the situation, General.

12
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:51,612
Well, in that case,
I will turn things over to the man

13
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:54,073
who's responsible for this situation.

14
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:58,619
Maybe he can walk us
through his path to victory.

15
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:02,957
So Agent Peña, what comes next?
The floor is yours.

16
00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:01,033
Don Gilberto...

17
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:05,246
- Leave it there.
- Okay.

18
00:04:07,957 --> 00:04:09,625
Enjoy your meal.

19
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:31,981
- Hello?
- 'Hi, brother, it's me.

20
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:37,403
- 'How are you doing?'
- Better if I knew how this happened.

21
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:43,200
'Gilberto, someone betrayed us.
Where the fuck were those pigs we pay?'

22
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:46,078
It was an American operation.
It was the DEA.

23
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:49,623
Our friends knew nothing about it.

24
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:54,003
Unless our friends
have been lying to us all along.

25
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:58,590
Maybe they need a reminder
what all that money was for.

26
00:04:58,716 --> 00:05:02,469
Relax, Miguel.
My situation will be rectified soon.

27
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:05,764
'The truth is that things
are getting more complicated.'

28
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:09,226
And our friends in the North Valley
need reassurance.

29
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:12,396
You need to set a meeting
with Henao.

30
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,648
'Compliment him.'

31
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:18,610
- On what?
- Doesn't matter. Offer him something.

32
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:22,406
'He likes tequila.
Have a bottle ready.'

33
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:27,453
Tell him...
this is just a small setback.

34
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,915
'In the meantime,
business goes on as usual.'

35
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:34,793
Increase your personal security.

36
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:37,921
'The Americans
will come after you next.

37
00:05:38,047 --> 00:05:41,133
'Your freedom is our best leverage,
brother.'

38
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,927
Gilberto, this is getting dangerous.

39
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:48,098
What if there's a leak?

40
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:55,439
There may be.
Find out.

41
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:58,025
'I need to go, brother. I love you.'

42
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,110
I love you too, brother.

43
00:06:05,074 --> 00:06:09,453
- 'What do you got for me?'
- Dog shit. Minus the dog and the shit.

44
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:13,499
Well, we knew it wasn't gonna be easy.
You gotta get creative.

45
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:17,586
All due respect, we're being told
we can't leave the base without an escort,

46
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:20,547
and now,
in a truly shocking turn of events,

47
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:23,425
we're being told there isn't enough
manpower to assign us one.

48
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,761
'We're fucking grounded.'

49
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:30,099
Look, I'll see what I can do
with the lockdown. I gotta go.

50
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:32,142
I'm meeting with the new
Minister of Defence.

51
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:35,521
And Feistl... you asked for this.

52
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:38,190
'Don't forget that, cos I know I won't.'

53
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:45,489
'Colombia had recently
elected a new president,

54
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:48,742
'a man named Ernesto Samper.

55
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:52,121
'Escobar's hitters had tried
to assassinate him in an earlier election.

56
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:54,498
'So he was no friend of the narcos.

57
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:58,585
'And while he knew his country
was tired of violence,

58
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:03,006
'he and his new staff, including
Defence Minister Fernando Botero,

59
00:07:03,132 --> 00:07:04,758
'were already in a tough spot.

60
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:10,597
'Politically, the surrender deal was ugly,
but they were willing to live with it.

61
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:13,183
'Gilberto's arrest made that
harder than planned,

62
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:16,019
'and they weren't shy about saying it.'

63
00:07:16,145 --> 00:07:19,648
I wanted to offer
my congratulations

64
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,692
on the arrest of Gilberto Rodríguez.

65
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:23,485
Thank you, sir.

66
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,821
Colonel Martínez deserves the credit.

67
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,906
Unfortunately,
he isn't here to receive it.

68
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:30,701
He should be.

69
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:34,079
I imagine he knew there might be
consequences for his actions.

70
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,331
A surrender deal was on the table,

71
00:07:36,457 --> 00:07:40,377
which would've brought all four leaders
of the Cali cartel to justice.

72
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:45,466
And now, that's been complicated,
and we are faced with the unknown.

73
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:47,342
Understood.

74
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:51,680
Though I'm not sure murderers negotiating
their own punishment qualifies as justice.

75
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:57,895
The deal preceded my tenure.

76
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,899
But between the two of us,
I share your reservations.

77
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:05,194
But no one wants a return
to the days of Pablo Escobar

78
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:07,237
and the bloodshed of Los Pepes.

79
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:09,823
No, of course not.

80
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:12,242
I won't ask if the rumours

81
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:14,661
about your involvement
with the vigilantes are true,

82
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:16,788
but I do have a question.

83
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:22,044
If it turns out that
we are indeed on the same side,

84
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:23,754
can I trust you?

85
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:28,800
You can trust that my only agenda
is to take down the Cali cartel.

86
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:33,013
Let me know if I can do anything.

87
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:36,975
Sir, my team in Cali
are operating under...

88
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:40,604
...severe restrictions.

89
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:43,065
They need their independence.

90
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:46,235
I'll make a call.

91
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,028
Thank you, sir.

92
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:52,241
Peña...

93
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:55,452
Justice can be hard to find.

94
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:58,747
And a man as powerful
as Gilberto Rodríguez

95
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,208
won't stay in custody for long.

96
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:06,964
If you want to keep him behind bars,
you need someone to testify.

97
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:09,091
Yes, sir. I'm on it.

98
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:13,887
I'm working on a high-level target.

99
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:18,684
I suggest you work fast,
because without it,

100
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:20,811
nothing else will matter.

101
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:28,694
We went through the machine, sir.
We've got nothing.

102
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:33,865
So what am I supposed to do with that?
What does this mean?

103
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:40,038
If somebody sold us out,
we'd know about it.

104
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,376
Like you knew about the raid?

105
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:50,716
Look, gentlemen...

106
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:57,180
I want to know why my brother
is sitting in a fucking cell.

107
00:09:57,306 --> 00:10:02,394
And if any one of us is involved in this,
I want to know by the end of the day.

108
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:06,356
Of course. Consider it done, sir.

109
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,913
Miguel's paranoid.

110
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:28,420
Maybe they used one of their spy planes
and spotted Gilberto from space.

111
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,756
You're not taking this seriously.

112
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:35,177
Miguel doesn't think they got lucky.
He thinks there's a leak.

113
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:38,305
And the system would tell us
about the leak.

114
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:41,308
This is about the surrender, right?

115
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:44,102
You're worried your retirement plans
are ruined now.

116
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:49,816
Listen to me. People love drama, brother.
You know that.

117
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:51,735
This isn't drama. He wants names.

118
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,363
And there's no reason to think
they couldn't be ours, Carlo.

119
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:56,406
We designed the system.

120
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:10,212
Mr. Cordova.

121
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,676
So? Anything good?

122
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:20,013
Just a bunch of shit-talking.
Gossip. Typical.

123
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:23,350
And what about internally?
Anyone suspicious you've flagged?

124
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:28,522
No, not really. Truth is, I have no idea
who would rat these guys out.

125
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:32,734
I want to hear everything you've flagged,
all the same. Quickly.

126
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:35,278
Yes, sir. I'll get that right away.

127
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:47,874
'These guys were supposed
to have all this under control.

128
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:50,043
'But it's clear they don't.'

129
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,840
'I thought those guys
were supposed to surrender.

130
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:57,259
'Does this mean it's not happening?'

131
00:11:57,384 --> 00:12:01,638
'Somebody tipped off
the Americans, stabbed us in the back.'

132
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:09,020
'Where was his fucking security
team? What do they pay them for?'

133
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:13,775
'They better do something quick,

134
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,486
'or else it's going to be
every man for himself.'

135
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:25,787
You have many powerful allies,
Don Gilberto.

136
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:28,290
Your situation pains them deeply.

137
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:32,043
We're confident this will soon be
behind us. The surrender will proceed.

138
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:35,213
But we need to wait.
It's a matter of time.

139
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,174
Wait for what?

140
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:40,927
For the government to do something
they already agreed to? Fuck.

141
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:42,471
What did Medina say?

142
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:48,560
Currently, we don't have
an official position from Santiago Medina.

143
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:49,978
Why not?

144
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,943
Because we're waiting on his office
to confirm a meeting.

145
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:02,866
Are you fucking kidding me?
You didn't talk to him yet?

146
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:06,161
You're waiting on his office
to confirm a meeting?

147
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:08,747
I don't wait on him!

148
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:10,665
He waits on me!

149
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,834
You go to his office and fix this mess!

150
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,588
And remind him who the fuck
Gilberto Rodríguez is!

151
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:21,134
For fuck's sake!
Open this damn thing!

152
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:25,972
Nicolás, your father needs to understand
his arrest changes things.

153
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:27,599
It's political now.

154
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:31,436
Dad?

155
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,940
Sometimes you have to put on
a little show.

156
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:37,150
Helps bring the best out of people.

157
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:41,363
- I need to talk to Medina.
- I don't want you anywhere near this.

158
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:44,825
Dad, the circle is too big.

159
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:49,579
Medina won't meet anyone he can't trust.
He won't trust the lawyers.

160
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:51,915
But he will trust you?

161
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:55,669
Yes, I'm your son.

162
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:59,005
That's right.
And you'll obey my wishes.

163
00:14:07,556 --> 00:14:10,141
'It's cold here all the time.

164
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:13,603
'I wake up
and the bed is freezing, empty.'

165
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:16,189
'I know,<i>bonita.</i>
I'll be home soon.'

166
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:18,942
'I just wish
I could be there with you.'

167
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:23,905
'I told you, Chris, it wouldn't look right.
it's not a good time.'

168
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:27,200
- Any word on the location?
- Nothing yet.

169
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:31,329
'I don't know, Franklin.
Maybe now is the perfect fucking time.

170
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:33,874
'You really think
they're gonna stop with Gilberto?

171
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:37,210
'And how long before the DEA
comes looking for you? For us?'

172
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:39,796
'Listen, I need you
to be strong, okay, babe?

173
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:44,050
'Nobody knows about us.
Nobody's looking for me, I promise.

174
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:46,928
- 'I'll call you later. I love you.'
- 'No, wait, Franklin...'

175
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:49,472
She's panicking.

176
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:54,561
Where are you going?

177
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:56,688
To give things a push.
We're running out of time.

178
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:58,982
Okay, can we talk
about this wiretap, though?

179
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:01,860
I mean, the legality of it?

180
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:08,700
Stoddard...

181
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:15,999
I want you to think about where
you see your career in five years.

182
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:20,170
Does having that conversation help
or hurt your chances of getting there?

183
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:55,205
You want something to drink?

184
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,749
I never refuse.

185
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:10,595
That's a great shirt, no?

186
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:18,311
That pocket... on the left.

187
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:23,316
Where the heart is.

188
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:38,790
Hey, this situation with Gilberto,
what a disgrace, huh?

189
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:44,879
After all your family's done
for this city. For this country.

190
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,552
Just the gringos meddling
where they shouldn't.

191
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:54,556
But our friends in Bogotá
are working to...

192
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:58,184
...rectify the situation.

193
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:03,690
Business proceeds as usual, right?

194
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:08,611
And how does this clerical error
affect the timeline of the surrender?

195
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:12,240
As I said...

196
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:17,162
...this was just a mistake.
Nothing more.

197
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,541
Glad to hear that.

198
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,813
I see a lot of new faces.

199
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,259
Did you notice that?

200
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:15,637
The woman, the Salazar girl?

201
00:18:16,221 --> 00:18:18,014
The fear.

202
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:20,100
Miguel was scared.

203
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:27,357
These guys are in big trouble.

204
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:38,660
Little early for number three, no?

205
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:41,538
The fuck else am I supposed to do
around here?

206
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:43,164
You didn't have to come.

207
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,292
Who else was gonna watch your back?

208
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:53,758
You gonna tell me
what went down in Juárez?

209
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:55,593
I told you...

210
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:57,929
...we talked.

211
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:03,017
The Mexican made you an offer.

212
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:06,062
Didn't he?

213
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:12,485
Yes.

214
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:15,738
A pretty good one, too.

215
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:20,660
He says we're getting out
at the wrong time.

216
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:24,914
Maybe he's right.

217
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:29,752
Gilberto's in jail.

218
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:34,174
Maybe this is fate.

219
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:51,316
How'd you come up with this place?

220
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:55,528
Buddy in the Defence Department.

221
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:58,531
The place was leased out
to debrief a witness against Noriega.

222
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:00,491
That was like three years ago.

223
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:10,835
Danny, you never cease to amaze me.

224
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,296
Not bad, right?

225
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:15,548
Well, the fucking A/C's still running.

226
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:17,967
Yeah, your tax dollars at work.

227
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:27,769
So? What's our first move?

228
00:20:28,937 --> 00:20:32,190
Circle back. See if we can pick up
a trail on that accountant.

229
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:39,239
World's deadliest fanny pack,
back in action.

230
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:41,532
Better fucking believe it.

231
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:12,605
No, the bill, please.

232
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:15,191
Compliments of the gentleman.

233
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:25,368
- Thank you, but I don't...
- Oh, uh...

234
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:29,122
Did I come over too fast?

235
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:32,292
It's tricky business
starting a conversation.

236
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:34,335
Not a lot of margin for error.

237
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:39,757
- You're an American.
- Yeah. Javi. From Texas.

238
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:44,512
- You?
- I'm from Boston originally.

239
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:47,098
Strangers in a strange land.

240
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:50,768
Well, I hope you don't mind. I was...

241
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:54,230
I saw you sitting over here and you...

242
00:21:55,857 --> 00:21:58,484
...reminded me of someone,
someone from home.

243
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:01,112
Ah! Sentimental.

244
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:03,865
Just a lonely patriot.

245
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:07,410
Anyway, I thought we could talk.

246
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:10,496
- Okay.
- No, I mean it. Just...

247
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:14,042
Just talk.

248
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:16,961
- I heard people still do that sometimes.
- Oh, yeah.

249
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:19,213
You know,
I think I saw it in a movie once.

250
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:23,301
Look, you seem like a nice guy,

251
00:22:23,426 --> 00:22:26,679
but I get the feeling
that just talking isn't your forte.

252
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:31,100
- And... I'm married, so...
- Happily?

253
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:34,228
Wow. Look at you now.

254
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:36,731
What? I mean, come on.

255
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:40,735
Your husband lets you brave the dangers
of happy hour by yourself?

256
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:44,197
He's traveling for work.

257
00:22:44,322 --> 00:22:46,991
Oh, can I guess? He's...

258
00:22:49,494 --> 00:22:51,871
...an astronaut.

259
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:54,791
- Brain surgeon.
- Yeah, uh-huh, a little bit of both.

260
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:56,417
- Uh-huh.
- Banking.

261
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:59,295
Oh, fuck.
I thought I couldn't like him any less.

262
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,714
I mean...

263
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,300
Okay, well, this has been fun.

264
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:09,222
So, what exotic destination
could pull him away from...

265
00:23:11,182 --> 00:23:12,683
...from all this?

266
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:21,192
Say hi to Texas for me.

267
00:23:21,943 --> 00:23:23,361
Christina...

268
00:23:27,198 --> 00:23:29,075
I didn't tell you my name.

269
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,952
You didn't have to.

270
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:38,543
Okay... You got me.
How do you know my name?

271
00:23:38,668 --> 00:23:42,964
Same way I know that your husband...
isn't in banking.

272
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:45,925
My name's Javier Peña.
I work for the DEA.

273
00:23:47,552 --> 00:23:49,929
You want to sit back down,
have a conversation?

274
00:23:53,224 --> 00:23:56,978
I'm not interested.
Enjoy your drink, Eliot Ness.

275
00:24:01,232 --> 00:24:02,567
Fuck.

276
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:06,612
The bill.

277
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:11,576
And they don't appear
on the next flights either?

278
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:14,912
No.

279
00:24:16,706 --> 00:24:22,420
Jorge... Motherfucking gringos
never got on a plane back to Bogotá.

280
00:24:22,545 --> 00:24:26,174
- Our friend with the badge lied to us.
- Or he made a mistake.

281
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:29,135
There are no mistakes.

282
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:38,644
Hey. Here he comes.

283
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:41,355
There he is, the fucking bastard.

284
00:24:42,732 --> 00:24:45,526
I would have gladly met you
in the usual place.

285
00:24:46,736 --> 00:24:49,238
That's what you're worried about?

286
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:52,783
How about earning the money we pay you
to keep our bosses out of jail?

287
00:24:52,909 --> 00:24:55,745
- You couldn't give a fuck about that.
- The fuck you want from me?

288
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:59,248
Logistics, planning, the dummy raid.
All that shit came out of Bogotá.

289
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:00,833
By the time we knew
what they were up to...

290
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:04,462
Martínez had already been
in Gilberto's house for 30 minutes,

291
00:25:04,587 --> 00:25:06,839
you useless piece of shit.

292
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:11,385
You know what else is odd?

293
00:25:12,637 --> 00:25:16,516
It looks like the DEA never left Cali.
And you were the one who confirmed.

294
00:25:17,642 --> 00:25:23,314
You, only you, confirmed those two
fucking gringos took the plane to Bogotá.

295
00:25:27,485 --> 00:25:29,237
Do you know where you are?

296
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:34,283
You want to hang me out to dry with
your boss? Do you know where you are?

297
00:25:35,785 --> 00:25:39,789
I asked the Americans how they found
Gilberto's house. Know what they told me?

298
00:25:39,914 --> 00:25:42,667
They followed someone there.

299
00:25:46,337 --> 00:25:49,048
I know it wasn't me.

300
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:10,027
Fucking Calderón.

301
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:12,989
What he said made sense.

302
00:26:13,573 --> 00:26:16,492
The DEA followed someone
to Gilberto's house.

303
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:20,746
It must be Pallomari. The DEA knows
who he is and where he works.

304
00:26:21,664 --> 00:26:24,166
They must've come back
and tailed him to Gilberto.

305
00:26:28,671 --> 00:26:32,383
Didn't you say you drove Pallomari
to Gilberto's that night?

306
00:26:38,598 --> 00:26:41,559
It could just as easily have been me
driving him.

307
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:47,106
Yeah, but it wasn't, was it?

308
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:49,775
You think Miguel will let this slide?

309
00:26:51,444 --> 00:26:53,154
Not a fucking chance.

310
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,616
Jorge, if this thing comes back on me,
it comes back on you,

311
00:26:56,741 --> 00:26:58,367
and then we're both fucked.

312
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:02,747
The only thing we need is a name,
and we have it.

313
00:27:03,831 --> 00:27:06,083
We have to get on the same page here.

314
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:11,756
Calderón told us those fuckers from
the DEA got on a plane to Bogotá, right?

315
00:27:11,881 --> 00:27:16,844
He burned us. He's the one
responsible for what happened.

316
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:19,180
He's a dirty cop...

317
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:23,309
...who takes money from a drug cartel.

318
00:27:26,896 --> 00:27:30,650
But you and me, we are brothers.

319
00:27:41,744 --> 00:27:45,081
Let me cut to the chase.
My father still wants to retire.

320
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:54,298
I didn't realise you were taking such
an active role in your father's affairs.

321
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:59,637
No other choice when friends
don't return our lawyer's calls.

322
00:28:01,097 --> 00:28:02,473
Of course.

323
00:28:04,392 --> 00:28:05,726
Well, then,

324
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:12,775
tell your father there is still a path
to what he wants most.

325
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:17,279
No one here is happy
with the current predicament.

326
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:24,036
The DEA blindsided all of us, and it's
been difficult to carry out our old deal.

327
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:27,248
"Old deal"?

328
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:31,627
Nicolás...

329
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:37,341
Politics is about appearances.

330
00:28:37,842 --> 00:28:41,178
For us, it's extremely difficult
to accept the surrender terms

331
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:43,848
of a man who's already in prison.

332
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:47,309
That just looks bad.

333
00:28:51,522 --> 00:28:55,443
But different terms, new terms...

334
00:28:57,528 --> 00:28:59,155
What do you say?

335
00:29:09,123 --> 00:29:11,333
So what did you find out?

336
00:29:13,127 --> 00:29:17,047
The DEA team that Calderón
was escorting never left Cali.

337
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:20,176
He reported that they had.

338
00:29:23,721 --> 00:29:27,433
- What do you think, Jorge?
- It was a mistake.

339
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,478
Born of incompetence.

340
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:36,066
The DEA got lucky...
and Calderón took the bait.

341
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:40,738
Well, we're not paying for incompetence.

342
00:29:42,198 --> 00:29:45,534
Besides, that doesn't explain
how they found my brother.

343
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:49,079
How did they get that information?
Was that also Calderón?

344
00:29:50,331 --> 00:29:52,082
It's unlikely.

345
00:29:53,209 --> 00:29:58,631
It's possible the DEA used
some high-end aerial surveillance.

346
00:30:03,803 --> 00:30:07,681
From here on out,
keep an eye on Calderón.

347
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:14,772
Limit what we tell him.
No more lapses in security.

348
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:17,316
- Yes, sir.
- Let's go.

349
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,708
Thank you, Jorge.

350
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,295
It's either him or us.

351
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:41,757
What if they kill him?

352
00:30:43,843 --> 00:30:46,262
They wouldn't kill a cop.

353
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:50,891
But they can question him.
And then what? What?

354
00:30:52,268 --> 00:30:56,730
By the time they get to it,
this shit will all be over.

355
00:31:22,965 --> 00:31:24,049
Hello?

356
00:31:24,174 --> 00:31:29,513
'Good afternoon. Someone is here
for you, Mrs. Jurado. Mr. Eliot Ness.'

357
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,354
Thanks for seeing me.

358
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:40,107
Didn't want you waving a badge
around our lobby.

359
00:31:44,028 --> 00:31:46,614
Are you gonna arrest me?

360
00:31:49,992 --> 00:31:51,785
You want to sit?

361
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:55,122
If what I wanted counted for anything,

362
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:58,542
you wouldn't be
in my living room right now.

363
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:03,172
May not see it this way yet,
but I... I am here to help you.

364
00:32:05,174 --> 00:32:08,093
Oh, I'm sure my well-being
is your top priority.

365
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:10,971
It's why you were buying me
martinis at the bar.

366
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:19,021
Gilberto Rodríguez is in jail.

367
00:32:20,189 --> 00:32:22,900
It won't be long before he has company.

368
00:32:23,025 --> 00:32:26,946
There's a very small window
for people like you and your husband

369
00:32:27,071 --> 00:32:29,907
to still be of any use to us.

370
00:32:30,032 --> 00:32:31,742
You're running out of time.

371
00:32:32,368 --> 00:32:36,205
So if Franklin really does care about you,
then he'll do what's right.

372
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:41,794
I mean, I don't know if the two of you
are thinking about starting a family...

373
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:45,547
Okay, look, for the record, you don't know
a fucking thing about my husband or me.

374
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:49,969
Okay. You're right.

375
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:55,182
But I do know that
there is no future for you

376
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:58,435
in any version of how this plays out
if he doesn't help us.

377
00:33:07,027 --> 00:33:09,446
I didn't plan on living like this.
It was...

378
00:33:10,698 --> 00:33:15,285
It was a mistake...
not stopping it sooner.

379
00:33:17,705 --> 00:33:20,207
You ever done anything like that?

380
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:21,959
I have.

381
00:33:24,753 --> 00:33:25,963
Okay.

382
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,845
So... what, that's it?

383
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:38,183
That's it.

384
00:33:47,276 --> 00:33:50,612
Think it over.
But don't take too long.

385
00:34:09,715 --> 00:34:13,343
Don't you even
want to know what he said?

386
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:16,346
How dare you disregard my wishes.

387
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:20,225
Nobody was going to get into a room
with Medina, and I did...

388
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:25,147
I don't want you involved.
I won't even discuss it.

389
00:34:25,856 --> 00:34:28,150
The old deal is dead.

390
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:37,826
But we can make a new one,
with certain adjustments.

391
00:34:40,871 --> 00:34:42,372
Motherfuckers.

392
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:47,127
Adjustments how?

393
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:51,131
There has to be some jail time.

394
00:34:51,965 --> 00:34:55,886
For you, Uncle Miguel,
Pacho and Chepe.

395
00:34:56,470 --> 00:35:00,516
- Three years.
- Three years? No chance.

396
00:35:02,226 --> 00:35:06,980
You surrender your illegal assets,
do the three years,

397
00:35:07,106 --> 00:35:10,609
and the legitimate assets, the cash,
the business, will all be retained.

398
00:35:10,734 --> 00:35:14,196
That's not the deal.
And you won't speak of this again.

399
00:35:14,321 --> 00:35:16,824
Dad, stop being so stubborn!

400
00:35:29,962 --> 00:35:32,297
You don't get to surrender.

401
00:35:33,257 --> 00:35:36,176
You are in jail.
You are a narcotrafficker.

402
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:41,390
No politician is going to stand up
and say, "Let him go,"

403
00:35:41,515 --> 00:35:44,685
no matter how much money
you've put in his pocket.

404
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,022
But son, it's three years...

405
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:57,906
It's not the old deal,
but it's a good one.

406
00:35:59,158 --> 00:36:01,243
The best we're going to get.

407
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,748
But there's one loose end.

408
00:36:08,292 --> 00:36:10,919
Medina is worried about his exposure.

409
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:17,176
More specifically,
the accountant... Pallomari.

410
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:20,053
He knows too much.

411
00:36:24,474 --> 00:36:25,642
<i>'Hola, bonita.'</i>

412
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:28,312
Baby, I thought
you said that you were gonna call.

413
00:36:28,896 --> 00:36:30,939
'I know. I had a late meeting.'

414
00:36:31,064 --> 00:36:32,691
Sorry, babe. I'm sorry.

415
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:34,735
Can you leave it there?

416
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,613
<i>Danki masha danki.</i>
Right?

417
00:36:37,738 --> 00:36:40,866
'Thank you.
Sorry. Room service.'

418
00:36:42,618 --> 00:36:45,746
How many of those little cakes
have you eaten so far?

419
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:48,081
I can see our island from my room.

420
00:36:48,916 --> 00:36:50,751
'I miss you,<i>bonita.'</i>

421
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,967
Franklin... what are we gonna do?

422
00:37:02,012 --> 00:37:04,598
Christina, you can't just walk away
from these people.

423
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:07,851
I know you keep saying that,
but maybe...

424
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:11,188
maybe we have more options
than we think.

425
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:14,691
What do you mean,
"more options"?

426
00:37:14,816 --> 00:37:18,070
'You know things. You know things
about the organisation...'

427
00:37:18,195 --> 00:37:21,198
'You want me to be a rat?
Have you been talking to someone?'

428
00:37:21,323 --> 00:37:26,078
'No, I just... Franklin, we need to talk.
We really need to talk about the future.'

429
00:37:26,203 --> 00:37:28,705
'We can't do this
on the phone. I'll call you later.'

430
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,374
Rewind.

431
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:34,503
Okay.

432
00:37:35,337 --> 00:37:38,966
'I had a late meeting.
Sorry, babe. I'm sorry.

433
00:37:39,091 --> 00:37:43,387
'Can you leave it there?
<i>Danki masha danki.</i> Right?

434
00:37:43,512 --> 00:37:46,598
'Thank you.
Sorry. Room service.'

435
00:37:51,311 --> 00:37:53,814
I think I might know where he is.

436
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:04,783
They probably set up shop
somewhere else after the raid.

437
00:38:14,126 --> 00:38:15,502
'Salcedo.'

438
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:18,088
The Americans are back
on the accountant's office,

439
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:20,090
hoping he shows.

440
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:23,176
Knowing that idiot, he might.

441
00:38:24,428 --> 00:38:27,639
If that's all they've got,
then they don't have much.

442
00:38:28,974 --> 00:38:34,062
'Stay on them.
Find out where they sleep at night.'

443
00:38:35,105 --> 00:38:39,651
All right.
Hey, boss. You doing okay?

444
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:44,740
- 'You sound tired.'
- Yeah. I'm fine.

445
00:38:45,991 --> 00:38:47,909
Keep me posted.

446
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:58,545
- How was the science test?
- Good.

447
00:38:58,670 --> 00:38:59,838
Daddy!

448
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,673
Daddy!

449
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:05,218
My princess. Hello, my princesses.
How are you all?

450
00:39:05,344 --> 00:39:07,262
Hello. What are you doing here?

451
00:39:07,387 --> 00:39:08,638
Hi, my love.

452
00:39:08,764 --> 00:39:11,058
Was it your turn or mine
to pick up the girls?

453
00:39:11,183 --> 00:39:14,895
Yours. I was in the neighbourhood.
Just wanted to see how my girls are doing.

454
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:18,023
- Daddy, today we have piano lessons.
- I know, my love.

455
00:39:18,607 --> 00:39:20,317
My little virtuosos.

456
00:39:20,901 --> 00:39:22,486
And you? Everything okay?

457
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:24,571
I'm fine.

458
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:27,949
I just felt like I needed to see my girls.
That's why I came.

459
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:33,663
Excuse me.

460
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:38,043
Looks like I have to go.

461
00:39:38,919 --> 00:39:41,046
Would you excuse me? Okay?

462
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:44,591
- Girls... I love you.
- Bye.

463
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:46,468
Bye, be good.

464
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:49,262
Salcedo.

465
00:39:49,846 --> 00:39:53,225
- 'Where are you?'
- What can I do for you, David?

466
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:57,437
'My dad called a meeting.
Top personnel.'

467
00:39:57,562 --> 00:40:00,565
What do you mean, a meeting?
We just had one.

468
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:02,692
'Well, we're having another one.

469
00:40:02,818 --> 00:40:06,238
'2611 Avenida 14. Out by Jamundí.
See you there.'

470
00:40:21,795 --> 00:40:24,339
'It's Carlo Cordova.
Leave a message.'

471
00:40:24,464 --> 00:40:26,425
Carlo, I just talked to David.

472
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:29,094
Are you on your way to the meeting?
Call me.

473
00:40:32,556 --> 00:40:35,392
Stoddard. Get this.

474
00:40:35,976 --> 00:40:39,187
According to the language guy at SLS,
<i>Dasha masha danki</i>

475
00:40:39,312 --> 00:40:42,607
means: "Thank you very much"
in Papiamento.

476
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:45,110
Okay.

477
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:46,903
Curaçao.

478
00:40:47,654 --> 00:40:50,365
Curaçao... I guess there's
a lot of banks there.

479
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:53,702
Yeah, there's a lot
of fucking banks there. Here it is.

480
00:40:54,286 --> 00:40:57,539
Baoase Luxury Resort.
Has an island villa you can rent.

481
00:40:58,165 --> 00:40:59,666
Okay. What do we do then?

482
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:02,669
Call the Dutch Caribbean police
in Willemstad.

483
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:04,463
Ask them if they can confirm

484
00:41:04,588 --> 00:41:07,132
anyone staying under
one of Franklin Jurado's aliases.

485
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:13,763
- We got him, didn't we?
- Not yet.

486
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:16,141
But he's there.

487
00:41:16,266 --> 00:41:17,893
- Call them.
- Yeah.

488
00:42:52,821 --> 00:42:55,073
'It's Carlo Cordova.
Leave a message.'

489
00:43:08,003 --> 00:43:11,673
I'm sitting there,
enjoying my dick getting sucked,

490
00:43:11,798 --> 00:43:14,634
when all of the sudden she stops.

491
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:18,388
I open my eyes
and I ask her, "What's up?"

492
00:43:19,139 --> 00:43:21,558
She's all quiet,
looking at me like this.

493
00:43:22,058 --> 00:43:23,727
Not a word.

494
00:43:23,852 --> 00:43:26,563
I'm like, "What the fuck?"
I turn to see Toque.

495
00:43:26,688 --> 00:43:32,444
Fuck, he has a gun pointed at him.
Like this.

496
00:43:32,569 --> 00:43:35,405
And the other girl,
the one with the gun, says to me:

497
00:43:36,323 --> 00:43:41,661
"Give me the money,
or she bites your dick off."

498
00:43:45,999 --> 00:43:48,960
- So what did you do?
- I gave her the fucking money!

499
00:43:49,085 --> 00:43:53,214
I even tipped her, Pacho.
You don't mess around with that!

500
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,925
- You want some ice?
- Sure.

501
00:43:59,012 --> 00:44:00,889
I'm having a great time.

502
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:03,350
I'm heading to Juárez tomorrow.

503
00:44:04,684 --> 00:44:07,771
Got some business with my partners.

504
00:44:09,439 --> 00:44:12,025
What am I going to tell them, Pacho?

505
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:16,196
I want to give them an answer.
Some good news.

506
00:44:23,578 --> 00:44:25,830
My turn to tell you a story, Amado.

507
00:44:27,248 --> 00:44:30,794
About the time my father found me
in my room with a boy.

508
00:44:30,919 --> 00:44:34,297
Hey, I never judged you for that stuff.

509
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:39,511
My father told me I wasn't a man,
that I'd never be one.

510
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:43,848
- It was the last time he spoke to me.
- What a fucking bastard.

511
00:44:46,059 --> 00:44:48,687
For a long time,
I thought he was right.

512
00:44:48,812 --> 00:44:51,481
Even after I started working
for Gilberto and Miguel.

513
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:56,736
Up until the day some motherfucker
told them I was a faggot.

514
00:44:57,195 --> 00:44:59,948
And that it was a mistake
to let me be part of the business.

515
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:05,370
You know what they did?

516
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:10,166
They made me a partner.

517
00:45:12,377 --> 00:45:15,588
Gilberto, Miguel and Chepe,
they are my family.

518
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:20,051
I can't just leave them
when they need me the most.

519
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:25,807
What can I say?

520
00:45:27,392 --> 00:45:31,479
I admire your loyalty.
You're one of a kind.

521
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:36,317
There you go.

522
00:46:23,907 --> 00:46:26,659
You better get inside.
Don't want to be late.

523
00:46:48,681 --> 00:46:50,308
Has your dad arrived?

524
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:53,645
No, not yet.

525
00:46:54,813 --> 00:46:56,231
Let's go.

526
00:46:56,689 --> 00:46:59,192

538
00:47:35,144 --> 00:47:37,230
Let me go, asshole!

539
00:47:41,734 --> 00:47:43,778
Let me go, motherfucker!

540
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:47,365
You don't have the balls!

541
00:47:49,158 --> 00:47:51,119
Let me go!

542
00:47:54,956 --> 00:47:56,291
Ah!

543
00:48:01,754 --> 00:48:03,047
Up!

544
00:48:06,718 --> 00:48:08,469
You motherfucker.

545
00:48:09,053 --> 00:48:11,931
What the fuck did you tell them,
motherfucker?

546
00:48:12,056 --> 00:48:14,225
Gilberto getting caught wasn't on me.

547
00:48:14,809 --> 00:48:17,270
You feel so safe, motherfucker.

548
00:48:18,271 --> 00:48:20,231
When it's your turn...

549
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:22,919
He was a tiger.

550
00:49:26,464 --> 00:49:27,966
Let's go.

551
00:49:57,161 --> 00:49:58,955
What the fuck is this?

552
00:49:59,914 --> 00:50:01,916
Tell him what you did.

553
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:05,670
Tell him.
Tell him where we caught you.

554
00:50:08,506 --> 00:50:10,925
While you were visiting
your wife and children,

555
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:14,804
this fucking rat was
on his way to the airport.

556
00:50:15,388 --> 00:50:17,974
With his wife, bags packed.

557
00:50:19,017 --> 00:50:22,311
About to leave you holding the blame.
Your friend, Jorge.

558
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:25,398
You had your bitch follow me?

559
00:50:27,108 --> 00:50:30,236
- What did you say?
- Me? And my children?

560
00:50:31,571 --> 00:50:34,282
You should be thankful,
motherfucker.

561
00:50:35,116 --> 00:50:39,203
It's why you're standing there...
instead of sitting next to him.

562
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:43,750
You're making a big mistake, David.

563
00:50:43,875 --> 00:50:46,878
I don't give a fuck what you think.

564
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:49,881
He's a loyal man.
He always has been.

565
00:50:51,049 --> 00:50:54,010
- He's a piece of shit, Jorge.
- He's a good man and loyal.

566
00:50:54,135 --> 00:50:56,012
- Then why was he running?
- What are you doing?

567
00:50:56,137 --> 00:50:58,556
- This is a good man...
- He's a fucking snitch!

568
00:50:58,681 --> 00:51:00,141
Jorge!

569
00:51:11,235 --> 00:51:12,987
Look at me.

570
00:51:13,905 --> 00:51:15,323
Sophia's inside.

571
00:51:16,282 --> 00:51:18,618
She's inside that room.

572
00:51:20,078 --> 00:51:23,164
Don't let them touch her.
Don't let them put a hand on Sophia.

573
00:51:23,289 --> 00:51:25,625
She has nothing to do with this, brother.

574
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:27,710
These fucking bastards are crazy...

575
00:51:27,835 --> 00:51:29,253
David, no!

576
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:36,427
Your friend was right, Jorge.

577
00:51:36,552 --> 00:51:38,387
Go check on Sophia.

578
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:17,677
My brother is in prison
because we were weak.

579
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:22,223
Because mistakes were made.

580
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:29,230
Because we allowed people
to be dishonest with us.

581
00:52:33,693 --> 00:52:36,154
These are the consequences.

582
00:52:39,949 --> 00:52:42,869
Mistakes will not be tolerated.

583
00:52:50,626 --> 00:52:53,796
Jorge, when he tried to run,

584
00:52:53,921 --> 00:52:57,800
he proved he was willing
to turn against us, all of us.

585
00:52:59,135 --> 00:53:02,638
Men with nothing to hide don't run, right?

586
00:53:08,477 --> 00:53:14,901
Now... I trust you can take over
Cordova's responsibilities.

587
00:53:17,737 --> 00:53:22,241
As our new head of security, Jorge.
What do you think?

588
00:53:29,665 --> 00:53:32,877
I'm glad I can count on you.

589
00:54:36,357 --> 00:54:39,777
My little girl, you're going to eat
a little bit of salad, okay?

590
00:54:39,902 --> 00:54:43,281
Vera is going to teach you.
Look how much she ate.

591
00:54:43,739 --> 00:54:46,450
Just a bit, sweetie.
Please, just eat a little bit.

592
00:54:46,575 --> 00:54:50,496
- Hi. I thought you'd be home later.
- Daddy's here!

593
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:56,002
Give me a minute.

594
00:55:38,377 --> 00:55:41,881
- Peña.
- 'It's me, Christina Jurado.'

595
00:55:43,007 --> 00:55:45,593
I'm glad you called. Are you okay?

596
00:55:45,718 --> 00:55:48,054
Please don't lie to me.

597
00:55:48,179 --> 00:55:50,848
If I do this, if I get my husband to...

598
00:55:51,974 --> 00:55:54,810
You can protect us?
We can go home?

599
00:55:54,935 --> 00:55:56,854
'You have my word.'

600
00:56:01,817 --> 00:56:03,361
I talked to him.

601
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:09,450
- You did? That's good.
- 'He's gonna... cooperate.'

602
00:56:09,575 --> 00:56:11,243
He said that?

603
00:56:11,369 --> 00:56:15,915
Oh, no, not yet, but he will.
I just... I need a little time.

604
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:21,670
That's fine.
You take all the time you need.

605
00:56:21,796 --> 00:56:27,843
'Attention passengers:
Now boarding flight 1935 to Curaçao.'

606
00:58:43,437 --> 00:58:45,648
Is that the landline?

607
00:58:51,737 --> 00:58:54,823
- 'Hello?'
- The cartel knows where you are.

608
00:59:08,587 --> 00:59:10,631
'Who is this?'

609
00:59:11,549 --> 00:59:14,093
'I think we can help each other out.'
