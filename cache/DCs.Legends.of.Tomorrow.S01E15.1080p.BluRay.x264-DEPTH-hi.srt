00:00:02,629 --> 00:00:04,005
RIP: <i>In 2166,</i>

2
00:00:04,172 --> 00:00:06,091
<i>an immortal tyrant
named Vandal Savage</i>

3
00:00:06,257 --> 00:00:08,718
<i>conquered the world
and murdered my wife and child.</i>

4
00:00:08,885 --> 00:00:10,470
<i>I have assembled an elite team</i>

5
00:00:10,637 --> 00:00:13,264
<i>to hunt him throughout time
and stop his rise to power.</i>

6
00:00:13,431 --> 00:00:15,725
<i>Unfortunately, my plan
is opposed by the body</i>

7
00:00:15,892 --> 00:00:17,352
<i>I had sworn my allegiance to,</i>

8
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:18,812
<i>the Time Masters.</i>

9
00:00:18,978 --> 00:00:21,106
<i>In the future,
my friends may not be heroes,</i>

10
00:00:21,272 --> 00:00:23,024
<i>but if we succeed,</i>

11
00:00:23,191 --> 00:00:25,652
<i>they will be remembered
as legends.</i>

12
00:00:28,196 --> 00:00:29,876
RORY: <i>Previously, on</i>
Legends of Tomorrow...

13
00:00:29,948 --> 00:00:31,366
<i>The Time Masters.</i>

14
00:00:31,533 --> 00:00:33,469
They took me to a place
called the Vanishing Point.

15
00:00:33,493 --> 00:00:35,495
<i>I've spent lifetimes
training by them.</i>

16
00:00:37,288 --> 00:00:38,641
GIDEON: <i>Mr. Jackson's
internal organs are aging</i>

17
00:00:38,665 --> 00:00:39,958
<i>at an accelerated rate.</i>

18
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:41,793
<i>The rest of his body
will soon follow.</i>

19
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,462
The trip through the Time Stream
should reverse your condition.

20
00:00:44,838 --> 00:00:46,131
If we're separated, you'll die.

21
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,595
This man you've brought before
us is needed back in 2166.

22
00:00:52,804 --> 00:00:54,013
<i>- Take him away.</i>
- What?

23
00:00:54,389 --> 00:00:55,974
DRUCE: <i>Search their ship
for the others.</i>

24
00:00:56,975 --> 00:00:57,976
You're under arrest.

25
00:00:58,727 --> 00:00:59,728
Mick, what's going on?

26
00:00:59,894 --> 00:01:01,205
We need to find
somewhere to hide.

27
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:03,523
SAVAGE: I better be
getting back to 2166.

28
00:01:03,732 --> 00:01:05,483
I've been waiting
to meet your family.

29
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,945
And because
if you don't follow me,

30
00:01:09,112 --> 00:01:13,158
this is what is in store for
your world, 150 years from now.

31
00:01:28,256 --> 00:01:30,341
I could've chosen any time
and any place.

32
00:01:31,092 --> 00:01:32,761
Of all the people
who ever lived,

33
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:34,179
I chose you eight.

34
00:01:34,345 --> 00:01:38,808
I certainly hope that you
won't let me and the world down.

35
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:50,195
If your answer is yes, meet me
at this address in 36 hours.

36
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,325
So what do you think?

37
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,453
I think that's five minutes
of my life I'm not getting back.

38
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,498
He just showed us
the entire world in flames.

39
00:02:01,664 --> 00:02:02,892
You can't turn your back
on that.

40
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:04,042
Observe.

41
00:02:07,212 --> 00:02:08,412
Well, I think we can all agree

42
00:02:08,463 --> 00:02:09,607
that the mission
would go a whole lot better

43
00:02:09,631 --> 00:02:10,840
without those two.

44
00:02:11,007 --> 00:02:12,133
I haven't signed on yet.

45
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,551
And I'm not signing on at all.

46
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,261
- Jefferson.
- No.

47
00:02:15,428 --> 00:02:17,972
I'm not going off to die
in some apocalyptic future.

48
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:19,766
I'm staying right here
in the present.

49
00:02:22,393 --> 00:02:23,561
Let me talk to him.

50
00:02:25,063 --> 00:02:26,064
<i>Jefferson.</i>

51
00:02:26,523 --> 00:02:28,316
Can we at least discuss this?

52
00:02:28,483 --> 00:02:29,526
Oh, that's a first.

53
00:02:29,692 --> 00:02:31,754
You know, it's always you
trying to tell me what to do.

54
00:02:31,778 --> 00:02:32,938
It's not happening this time.

55
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:34,948
But if the fate of the world
is at stake--

56
00:02:35,114 --> 00:02:37,534
Then the world can find somebody
more capable than me.

57
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,911
I have confidence in us
as Firestorm.

58
00:02:40,078 --> 00:02:41,398
All right, look.
Just sleep on it.

59
00:02:42,914 --> 00:02:44,975
Come to my office tomorrow,
and if your answer is still no--

60
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:46,084
It will be.

61
00:02:52,382 --> 00:02:54,425
Grey, we need to talk.

62
00:02:56,344 --> 00:02:57,887
We were... We were just talking.

63
00:02:58,513 --> 00:03:00,932
How did you change your clothes
so fast?

64
00:03:01,307 --> 00:03:02,467
Something called time travel.

65
00:03:03,977 --> 00:03:05,144
I need your help.

66
00:03:05,353 --> 00:03:07,105
The team's in trouble.

67
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:23,788
(PROFESSOR STEIN COUGHING)

68
00:03:24,622 --> 00:03:26,332
KENDRA: Martin, are you okay?

69
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:30,670
I'm required to merge
with Jefferson periodically

70
00:03:30,837 --> 00:03:32,797
in order to maintain
nuclear cohesion.

71
00:03:32,964 --> 00:03:34,632
Then sending him away
in the Jumpship

72
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,885
probably wasn't
the greatest idea.

73
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:38,678
<i>Given the circumstances
we're under,</i>

74
00:03:38,845 --> 00:03:41,055
I'm surprised
any of us are alive.

75
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,433
Oh, you'll be dead soon.

76
00:03:43,933 --> 00:03:45,602
<i>You're getting off easy.</i>

77
00:03:45,768 --> 00:03:47,103
What gives you the free pass?

78
00:03:48,271 --> 00:03:50,023
They have other plans for me.

79
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:51,316
As Chronos.

80
00:03:51,482 --> 00:03:53,067
They're gonna try and put me

81
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:55,028
through the induction
process again.

82
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,321
Brainwashing.

83
00:03:56,487 --> 00:03:58,114
RORY: <i>Kills most men, Professor.</i>

84
00:03:58,281 --> 00:04:02,744
And those that don't die,
end up like mindless goats.

85
00:04:02,911 --> 00:04:05,192
But Snart said you weren't
mindless when you were Chronos.

86
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:07,081
Not any more than usual, anyway.

87
00:04:07,498 --> 00:04:08,583
Mmm.

88
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:11,377
The whole time I stayed focused
on one thing.

89
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:13,671
The one thing that kept me sane.

90
00:04:15,048 --> 00:04:16,341
Vengeance.

91
00:04:16,633 --> 00:04:18,801
<i>I focused on how much
I hated all of you.</i>

92
00:04:20,345 --> 00:04:24,599
Ah, gentlemen, I missed you.
Come on in.

93
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:29,187
Oh, that's it. Oh, yeah. Break my arm.

94
00:04:29,604 --> 00:04:30,605
RAY: <i>Hey!</i>

95
00:04:31,022 --> 00:04:32,732
What are you doing?
Why are you taking her?

96
00:04:33,566 --> 00:04:34,609
<i>Hey!</i>

97
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:36,611
(GRUNTING)

98
00:04:45,411 --> 00:04:46,454
Hey!

99
00:04:46,746 --> 00:04:47,956
Kendra!

100
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,875
Kendra!

101
00:05:04,931 --> 00:05:06,015
Leave us.

102
00:05:10,895 --> 00:05:12,105
I have a query.

103
00:05:12,438 --> 00:05:13,638
Why haven't we killed you yet?

104
00:05:13,731 --> 00:05:15,733
That's what you've been trying
to do all this time.

105
00:05:16,234 --> 00:05:19,237
Fortunately for you, two of your
crew are still at large.

106
00:05:19,404 --> 00:05:22,156
Tell me where to find them,
and I'll spare the others.

107
00:05:22,323 --> 00:05:24,909
If it is anything like the offer
you gave me in the USSR,

108
00:05:25,076 --> 00:05:26,577
I'm sorely tempted.

109
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:28,538
You were a fugitive
from justice.

110
00:05:28,705 --> 00:05:30,432
You're helping Vandal Savage
take over the world.

111
00:05:30,456 --> 00:05:32,792
I have a feeling that our
definition of the word "justice"

112
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,085
may differ somewhat.

113
00:05:34,252 --> 00:05:36,254
The only difference
between us is,

114
00:05:36,421 --> 00:05:39,966
my view of the timeline reaches
further and wider than yours.

115
00:05:40,133 --> 00:05:41,592
Am I supposed to be impressed?

116
00:05:44,554 --> 00:05:48,433
In 2175, less than 10 years from
when Savage conquers the world,

117
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:49,684
the Earth is attacked

118
00:05:49,851 --> 00:05:52,437
by a warlike race
of extraterrestrials

119
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:54,272
from the planet Thanagar.

120
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:55,606
<i>Without Savage</i>

121
00:05:55,773 --> 00:05:57,775
<i>to unite the world
under a singular rule,</i>

122
00:05:59,777 --> 00:06:01,654
<i>this is what becomes
of the world.</i>

123
00:06:01,821 --> 00:06:03,448
This is the work of Savage.

124
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:05,074
No.

125
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:07,326
This is what will happen
to Earth

126
00:06:07,702 --> 00:06:09,620
<i>if Savage is not there
to lead it.</i>

127
00:06:09,787 --> 00:06:12,790
Without him,
all human life is extinguished.

128
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:15,501
Even this realm falls
to the Thanagarians.

129
00:06:16,127 --> 00:06:17,336
Are you impressed now?

130
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:19,297
No.

131
00:06:19,964 --> 00:06:22,467
You are as mad
as your friend Vandal

132
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:25,970
if you think that
he is the world's only hope.

133
00:06:27,096 --> 00:06:29,766
We've examined the timeline,
there is no other hope.

134
00:06:30,808 --> 00:06:33,394
I don't expect you
to take my word for it.

135
00:06:33,728 --> 00:06:35,897
That's why there is something
else I have to show you.

136
00:06:45,156 --> 00:06:46,282
(GRUNTS)

137
00:06:50,161 --> 00:06:52,205
How did you even know
that was down there?

138
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:54,784
When Rip first recruited us,

139
00:06:54,832 --> 00:06:57,960
I made it my business to case
every square inch of this tub

140
00:06:58,127 --> 00:07:00,046
in the event there was something
worth stealing.

141
00:07:00,213 --> 00:07:02,548
There wasn't.
Let's get out of here.

142
00:07:03,341 --> 00:07:04,509
Wait, what about the team?

143
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:05,861
There's nothing more we can do
for them.

144
00:07:05,885 --> 00:07:07,165
You're just going to leave Mick?

145
00:07:07,345 --> 00:07:10,681
If the Time Masters are half
as twisted as Mick said,

146
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:13,351
there is an excellent chance
Mick is no longer Mick.

147
00:07:13,518 --> 00:07:14,811
Now, why aren't we flying yet?

148
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:16,813
Because I'm not going anywhere.

149
00:07:17,188 --> 00:07:18,523
And even if we wanted to,

150
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:21,526
we're in a hangar surrounded by
an entire armada of Timeships.

151
00:07:21,692 --> 00:07:23,820
It's the <i>Waverider.</i>
We've got guns.

152
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:25,404
We can blast our way out.

153
00:07:25,571 --> 00:07:27,281
This isn't <i>Bonnie and Clyde,</i>

154
00:07:27,448 --> 00:07:29,784
and I'm not going anywhere
without the rest of the team.

155
00:07:29,951 --> 00:07:31,369
(POWERING UP)

156
00:07:31,828 --> 00:07:33,830
Maybe I didn't make
myself clear.

157
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:36,040
Don't do that.

158
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:38,960
Don't act like you're that
same coldhearted bastard

and you were the one
who told me not to kill Stein.

162
00:07:44,757 --> 00:07:47,760
Yeah, because you seem to have
a problem with being a killer.

163
00:07:47,927 --> 00:07:50,096
I, however, don't.

168
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:19,917
Gideon, you're alive.

169
00:08:20,418 --> 00:08:21,586
<i>If by being alive,</i>

170
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:23,963
<i>you mean that my

171
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:26,090

173
00:08:28,092 --> 00:08:30,070
We can share war stories later.
Where is the rest of the team?

00:08:30,094 --> 00:08:33,806
<i>They are in cell block 4587,

00:08:35,266 --> 00:08:36,934
Wait, what do you mean,
"For the moment"?

177
00:08:45,276 --> 00:08:46,444
Oh, you're awake.

He's being held in stasis
down at the cargo hold.

And where are you taking us?

188
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:14,972
To an appointment that I have

189
00:09:16,349 --> 00:09:17,642
with destiny.

190
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:24,148
You should be familiar
with this procedure, Chronos.

191

The name's Mick.

192

Though we've made
some refinements,

193
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,330
clearly your conditioning
was not as thorough

194
00:09:31,447 --> 00:09:32,531
as it should have been.

195
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:35,034
For a Time Master,
you sure waste a lot of it.

196
00:09:36,494 --> 00:09:38,496
Even with only
a partial induction,

197

<i>you were the greatest
of our hunters, Chronos.</i>

200

at the sound of your bootsteps.

201
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:52,343
Hmm. Well, for your sake,
you better hope that plan works,

The Oculus viewing chamber.

Our most powerful window
into past, present and future.

The source of all
our information on the timeline.

No captain does.

212

The Oculus' existence is known
only to the High Council,

including its greatest secret.

214

<i>The Oculus not only gives us

<i>From the moment we realized only
Savage could save the world,</i>

we've been using the Oculus

222
00:10:58,242 --> 00:10:59,285
That's impossible.

Think about it.
Thanks to your efforts,

224
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:02,913
Vandal Savage was not imprisoned

225
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,374
for the sale of
a nuclear weapon in 1975.

226
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:08,169
You prevented the Soviet Union

227
00:11:08,336 --> 00:11:11,130
from winning the Cold War
in 1986.

No!

No matter what you do,
it will happen,

250
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,502
and there is nothing you can do
to stop it.

251
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:32,979
No, I acted
without your consent.

252

In defiance of your orders.

253

No one controls me!

00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:45,349
We counted on that, your anger,
on you going rogue.

256
00:12:45,516 --> 00:12:47,601
We needed something
to spur you on.

00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:49,895
<i>To give you purpose.</i>

258

than a nuclear physicist.

Instead of pestering me
about the future,

and being
an insufferable know-it-all,

why don't you help me reroute

You're not helping
your argument.

323

We need to finish putting these
on the ships,

324

to the <i>Waverider.</i>

Well, if it's any consolation,
you're not alone.

00:16:52,888 --> 00:16:54,264
What? You're giving up, too?

329
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:57,976
Well, let's just review our
situation, shall we, Raymond?

330

<i>They're turning Mr. Rory
back into Chronos,</i>

I'm about to have
a nuclear meltdown--

332
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:04,566
And our captain thinks

333
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:06,652
that our future
is already written for us.

334

<i>You know what I think?</i>

335
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:10,131
I think you both
are a couple of quitters.

336
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:13,534
There's no escape from neither
these cells or from the future.

337
00:17:13,701 --> 00:17:17,121
Face the facts, Raymond,
we're completely out of allies.

338
00:17:17,788 --> 00:17:19,373
You're forgetting
Sara and Snart.

339
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:23,961
As long as they're on the loose,
we still have a chance.

SNART: Even if this works,

342
00:17:28,424 --> 00:17:30,342
we're never going to be able
to fly out of here.

343
00:17:30,509 --> 00:17:32,237
SARA: Well, that's the beauty
of having a Timeship,

344
00:17:32,261 --> 00:17:33,971
you don't have to fly anywhere.

345
00:17:37,182 --> 00:17:38,851
Can you stop doing that?

346
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:42,229
Why did you start wearing
that thing, anyways?

347
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:44,648
It's from the first job
I ever pulled off with Mick.

348

349
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,445
Aw, you do have a sentimental side.

350
00:17:49,611 --> 00:17:51,780
It's not a keepsake.
It's a reminder.

351

Of what?

352
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:56,493
That even the best laid plans
can go sideways.

353
00:17:57,453 --> 00:18:00,080

their security system.

358

Three weeks of planning,

360

Was a lousy pinky ring.

So sad.

362

my life for nothing,

00:24:14,412 --> 00:24:16,873
Have you ever listened
to what comes out of his mouth?

478
00:24:17,249 --> 00:24:19,876
Now, in my opinion, Dr. Palmer's
death is not part of their plan.

479
00:24:20,085 --> 00:24:21,503
No. That's not reassuring.

480
00:24:22,212 --> 00:24:23,255
Ow!

481
00:24:23,547 --> 00:24:25,715
You're saying the Time Masters
wanted me to do that?

482
00:24:25,924 --> 00:24:27,050
What I'm saying

483
00:24:27,217 --> 00:24:28,361
is that they've been engineering

484
00:24:28,385 --> 00:24:30,679
our lives to move
in very specific directions

485
00:24:30,846 --> 00:24:33,682
and we are playing out
that script, even now.

486
00:24:33,849 --> 00:24:35,892
So we can go to 2016,

487
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:37,370
but that might be
what the Time Masters want.

488
00:24:37,394 --> 00:24:39,396
Or we could go get Kendra
and Carter--

489
00:24:39,563 --> 00:24:41,356
Which could also be
what they want.

490
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:44,109
Then we need to do
what they don't want.

491
00:24:45,068 --> 00:24:47,028
If the Oculus is what
they're using to control us,

492
00:24:47,112 --> 00:24:48,905
then, we need to destroy it.

493
00:24:49,072 --> 00:24:50,574
But how do we do that

494
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,576
if the Time bastards
are pulling our strings?

495
00:24:52,742 --> 00:24:55,537
Druce told me that the Oculus'
ability to control our actions

496
00:24:55,704 --> 00:24:57,205
doesn't work in
the Vanishing Point.

497
00:24:57,372 --> 00:24:58,516
Most likely because
the Vanishing Point

498
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,167
itself exists outside of time.

499
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:02,460
Explains why we were able
to escape.

500
00:25:02,627 --> 00:25:05,547
And why we might actually have
a shot at destroying this thing.

501
00:25:07,257 --> 00:25:08,967
- I'm with Ray.
- Ow.

502
00:25:10,093 --> 00:25:11,803
If I'm gonna be
someone's puppet,

503
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:13,890
I'm gonna be one
who cuts his own bloody strings.

504
00:25:14,264 --> 00:25:15,849
And I like blowing stuff up.

505
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:18,768
We set out on this mission to
stop Savage and save the world.

506
00:25:18,935 --> 00:25:21,855
To become legends
and change our fates.

507
00:25:22,022 --> 00:25:23,142
That mission hasn't changed.

508
00:25:23,273 --> 00:25:25,859
This is madness.

509
00:25:27,444 --> 00:25:28,695
I like it.

510
00:25:31,698 --> 00:25:33,158
Gideon.

511
00:25:33,325 --> 00:25:36,244
Plot a course
to the Oculus Wellspring.

512
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:37,871
Team...

513
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,875
I think it's about time
we seized our destinies back.

514
00:25:49,382 --> 00:25:50,508
Mmm.

515
00:25:54,137 --> 00:25:55,305
- If I'm gonna die...
- Huh.

516
00:25:55,472 --> 00:25:56,640
...no sense watching my diet.

517
00:25:56,806 --> 00:25:59,309
Time Masters have been known
to make mistakes, you know.

518
00:26:01,311 --> 00:26:03,313
What if those mistakes
were all part of their plan?

519
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:05,374
Actually, I gotta stop thinking
about it.

520
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:06,918
The temporal implications
are infinite.

521
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:08,818
That's why I don't think.

522
00:26:10,195 --> 00:26:11,988
- Not bad, right?
- Good.

523
00:26:13,198 --> 00:26:15,116
- So, how did you do it?
- Do what?

524
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:17,327
How did you not get turned
into Chronos?

525
00:26:17,661 --> 00:26:20,330
You said the only way you held
on to yourself, the first time,

526
00:26:20,497 --> 00:26:22,499
was by focusing on your hate.

527
00:26:22,832 --> 00:26:24,032
What did I focus on this time?

528
00:26:27,504 --> 00:26:28,505
The team.

529
00:26:30,507 --> 00:26:31,707
And how much you cared for us?

530
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:34,998
And thought about how royally
screwed you'd be without me.

531
00:26:35,053 --> 00:26:36,096
My point being,

532
00:26:36,846 --> 00:26:38,974
if I can survive
not being turned into Chronos,

533
00:26:40,517 --> 00:26:42,811
you can survive anything
they throw at you.

534
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,188
Thanks. I'll keep it in mind.

535
00:26:45,438 --> 00:26:47,023
Well, you better.

536
00:26:47,857 --> 00:26:50,193
Because if you tell the team
I actually care,

537
00:26:51,361 --> 00:26:52,362
I'll shave your head.

538
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:57,951
Wow. This is good.

539
00:27:09,713 --> 00:27:10,797
Not in the mood.

540
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:15,218
I was gonna apologize
for pulling a gun on you.

541
00:27:16,553 --> 00:27:18,722
But apparently,
I was just following a script.

542
00:27:18,888 --> 00:27:21,016
Doesn't make you
any less of a jerk.

543
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,351
Guilty.

544
00:27:24,394 --> 00:27:25,895
So, what do we think
of Rip's plan?

545
00:27:27,147 --> 00:27:28,148
Does it matter?

546
00:27:29,441 --> 00:27:30,942
Apparently,
everything we're gonna do

547
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:33,862
has already been predetermined
by Rip's former bosses.

548
00:27:34,404 --> 00:27:36,740
It's funny.
I've always prided myself

549
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:39,159
on being the guy
who doesn't play by the rules.

550
00:27:39,367 --> 00:27:40,744
<i>Come to find out,</i>

551
00:27:41,578 --> 00:27:43,330
I'm the one being played.

552
00:27:43,872 --> 00:27:45,498
I don't know.

553
00:27:45,665 --> 00:27:47,667
I still feel responsible
for everything I've done.

554
00:27:48,418 --> 00:27:50,086
<i>And it still keeps me up
at night.</i>

555
00:27:51,087 --> 00:27:53,923
It's the things I didn't do,
that keep me up at night.

556
00:27:54,549 --> 00:27:57,010
- What's that?
- Oh, I don't know.

557
00:27:57,177 --> 00:28:00,096
Maybe it's being on this ship,
traveling through time.

558
00:28:00,722 --> 00:28:03,350
Started to wonder what
the future might hold for me.

559
00:28:04,517 --> 00:28:05,518
And you.

560
00:28:07,228 --> 00:28:08,521
And me and you.

561
00:28:10,607 --> 00:28:12,567
You want to steal
a kiss from me, Leonard?

562
00:28:13,568 --> 00:28:15,236
You better be
one hell of a thief.

563
00:28:23,787 --> 00:28:24,913
How are you feeling, Martin?

564
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:27,123
Well, I'm dying.

565
00:28:27,957 --> 00:28:30,627
I'm also sure that you're dying
and so are all the others.

566
00:28:31,878 --> 00:28:34,089
I'm just a little ahead of you.

567
00:28:35,632 --> 00:28:37,967
Normally, I'd be quite
concerned, but the truth is

568
00:28:38,635 --> 00:28:41,846
discovering one's life has
already been predetermined, is

569
00:28:43,139 --> 00:28:44,391
ironically liberating.

570
00:28:45,308 --> 00:28:48,144
I've already run through
everything we know

571
00:28:48,311 --> 00:28:49,604
about the Oculus.

572
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:51,981
And with the help of a few

573
00:28:52,148 --> 00:28:53,942
back-of-the-envelope
physics calculations,

574
00:28:54,109 --> 00:28:56,069
I've determined that
we have a chance.

575
00:28:56,986 --> 00:28:58,780

578
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,797
Based on
Captain Hunter's description,

579
00:29:15,964 --> 00:29:18,842
the Oculus is a massive,
temporal computer,

580
00:29:19,008 --> 00:29:21,970
most likely powered
by a scaled-down supernova

581
00:29:22,137 --> 00:29:24,347
contained at the bottom
of the Wellspring.

582
00:29:24,514 --> 00:29:26,349
Why aren't any of you
more excited about this?

583
00:29:26,516 --> 00:29:27,684
We're excited to blow it up.

584
00:29:27,851 --> 00:29:30,437
Dr. Palmer will deactivate
the core containment supernova,

585
00:29:30,645 --> 00:29:32,689
which should create
an anomalistic event.

586
00:29:34,482 --> 00:29:37,193

I say we have about two minutes

00:33:21,668 --> 00:33:22,811
before this whole place
goes boom.

637
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:23,961
How big of a boom?

638
00:33:24,128 --> 00:33:25,963

Can't work

- No, you don't.

00:33:41,229 --> 00:33:43,731
This is what I saw.
This is what Druce showed me.

646
00:33:44,941 --> 00:33:45,942
This is how you die.

647
00:33:49,404 --> 00:33:52,448
It's okay. All my life, I've
wanted to make a difference.

648
00:33:52,615 --> 00:33:54,242
Creating a future for you guys

So, keep them off, okay?

654
00:34:05,128 --> 00:34:06,170

- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh?

664
00:34:45,168 --> 00:34:46,878
There seems to be a fail-safe.

665
00:34:47,044 --> 00:34:48,254
To prevent tampering.

666
00:34:48,463 --> 00:34:50,923
Which probably includes
trying to blow this thing up.

Well, Ray is in my pocket

Why?

Someone needs to be present

- No.

Just do it.

Yes. It means that
Leonard didn't die for nothing.

He planted that on me

But they have provided me
with a Timeship.

I no longer need
