Why did the maid have to take off today!

5
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:40,911
Mom!
Toothpaste is over.

6
00:03:41,286 --> 00:03:42,286
Take it from my bathroom.

7
00:03:42,453 --> 00:03:44,286
That herbal one?! I hate that Mom!

8
00:03:44,786 --> 00:03:47,370
If you hate, you go buy!
Give.

9
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,328
There is enough paste for 4 days!

00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,620
Tara! My tea!

00:03:53,078 --> 00:03:56,453

stock prices go up!

Mom!!

15
00:04:01,995 --> 00:04:05,411
Maid is off duty,
Tara has to go for duty...

17
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,328
I'll be late today

18
00:04:10,661 --> 00:04:11,953
No!

19
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:14,161
Your "no" does not matter

20
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:17,203
Anya stop this,
I don't have time for your fights today.

21
00:04:17,328 --> 00:04:18,036
Eat!

22
00:04:18,161 --> 00:04:20,078
Please focus on your daughter

All night chatting on the phone!

24
00:04:23,453 --> 00:04:24,911
She is pushing the limit!

25
00:04:25,828 --> 00:04:28,995
Malhotra's daughter eloped
with some Facebook friend!

26
00:04:30,328 --> 00:04:31,370
Dilip!

27
00:04:32,203 --> 00:04:33,370
Can you stop it?

28
00:04:34,203 --> 00:04:35,203
It's an instant heater...

29
00:04:35,245 --> 00:04:36,953
Why do you need to
turn it on 4 hours earlier?

30
00:04:37,036 --> 00:04:37,870
What's this?

31
00:04:43,828 --> 00:04:44,870
Dilip!!!

32

Breakfast is ready...
Please come!

I don't want breakfast

- Lazy bum can be a useful bum!
- Mom!

35
00:04:58,911 --> 00:05:00,370
Baba why did you come out?

36
00:05:01,036 --> 00:05:03,745
I can also serve myself for a day!

37
00:05:04,203 --> 00:05:06,786
Sunil! Today is the last day
to pay the electricity bill

38
00:05:06,911 --> 00:05:07,828
Are you mad?

39
00:05:08,203 --> 00:05:09,911
Who is going to stand
in that bloody queue?

40
00:05:09,995 --> 00:05:12,203
Sunil, atleast help her out today!

41
00:05:12,661 --> 00:05:13,786
Please forgive me Tara

42
00:05:14,203 --> 00:05:16,203
To have raised such a useless son!

43
00:05:17,328 --> 00:05:19,078
Ok ok
I'll go pay it

44
00:05:19,245 --> 00:05:21,078
But where do I pay?

45
00:05:21,745 --> 00:05:22,828
At the stock market!

46

Anya...

47
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,453
The pizza will arrive by 12...

48
00:05:25,745 --> 00:05:27,453
And give Grandpa his medicine on time.

49
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:28,786
Yes mom!

50
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:30,453
Don't need vegetables today!

51
00:06:06,495 --> 00:06:10,828
Cyrus, I need the coordinates
for turbo thrust and launch...

52
00:06:10,911 --> 00:06:11,786
Sure, ma'am

53
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:12,911
- And Sapna,
- Yes, ma'am?

54
00:06:12,995 --> 00:06:14,370
Can you show me the numbers
for that please?

Sir... GSLV Fat Boy. All ready to launch.

57
00:06:57,578 --> 00:07:00,453
Why has this rocket been named Fat Boy?

58
00:07:00,578 --> 00:07:03,036
Sir, it can lift the
weight of two elephants.

59
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,828
It's a very powerful rocket!

82

Ma'am, the turbo pump is

- signaling above normal temperature...
- Network...

84
00:08:12,786 --> 00:08:14,036
Chances of malfunctioning, ma'am...

Satellite control...

86
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:17,578

What is the status of fuel connectors?

90
00:08:21,953 --> 00:08:23,453
- Hundred percent integrity.
- Great.

91
00:08:23,911 --> 00:08:24,578
Telemetry command...

92
00:08:24,661 --> 00:08:26,245
Temperature fluctuations

- Propulsion control...

00:08:28,995 --> 00:08:29,745
Go!

95
00:08:30,036 --> 00:08:30,495
Good.

96
00:08:31,786 --> 00:08:35,995

00:09:59,036 --> 00:10:01,286
20 seconds to first
stage release to S1BO

101
00:10:35,203 --> 00:10:36,245

102
00:10:36,328 --> 00:10:39,578
Rocket going off-course
towards land at 13 degrees North

103
00:10:39,661 --> 00:10:41,328

<i>(Humming)

109
00:11:36,286 --> 00:11:37,078
Sir...

110
00:11:38,411 --> 00:11:40,161
I misjudged.

111
00:11:40,411 --> 00:11:43,786
I thought the alarm was because
of the ambient temperature.

112
00:11:45,203 --> 00:11:47,078
Fuel connectors health was 100%, sir!

113
00:11:47,411 --> 00:11:48,661
Congratulations on the failure

114
00:11:49,203 --> 00:11:51,328
Mr Rakesh, the press is waiting.

115
00:11:54,786 --> 00:11:55,661
Good evening everyone...

116
00:11:55,786 --> 00:12:00,745
I regret to announce that the
launch of GSLV Fatboy was unsuccessful.

117
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,203
The fuel booster turbo-

118
00:12:02,286 --> 00:12:04,203
Despite the alarm
why was the launch initiated ?

119
00:12:04,254 --> 00:12:05,180
<i>were they any checks in balances</i>

120
00:12:05,203 --> 00:12:06,578
Who is responsible for this?

121
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,120
I took the call.
The decision was mine.

122
00:12:11,203 --> 00:12:13,745
The country has suffered a huge loss,
and you're eating sweets?

123
00:12:14,661 --> 00:12:17,786
Where is it written on the sweet that it
cannot be eaten during loss?

124
00:12:23,203 --> 00:12:24,411
Thank you, everyone.

125
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:34,995
<i>(Humming)
-Blowing away the worries...</i>

126
00:12:41,536 --> 00:12:43,203
The fire cracker rockets are better than this!

127
00:12:43,411 --> 00:12:44,745
At least they fly!

128
00:12:45,245 --> 00:12:49,453
India's biggest super rocket
has crashed in the Bay of Bengal.

129
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,370
This government
has spent millions of Rupees...

130
00:12:52,453 --> 00:12:54,078
and made the country a laughing stock.

131
00:12:54,203 --> 00:12:56,620
Some of the best scientists
in the world are Indians...

132
00:12:56,745 --> 00:13:00,328
Unfortunately they work
for NASA or other space agencies...

133
00:13:00,578 --> 00:13:06,120
And the duffers remaining here
keep sinking the taxpayers money!

134
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:09,286
I want an Inquiry into this!

135
00:13:12,828 --> 00:13:13,536
Funny!

136
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:15,286
You find this funny?

137
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:18,036
Despite the alarm how
could you give the go ahead?

138
00:13:18,661 --> 00:13:19,745
What a big mistake!

139
00:13:19,953 --> 00:13:22,036
Because of your mistake...

140
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,161
India's space program
has been set back by 5 years!

141
00:13:24,745 --> 00:13:27,495
GSLV Fat Boy was the only rocket...

142
00:13:27,578 --> 00:13:31,870
that could have helped
India plan its 1st manned mission in space.

143
00:13:32,203 --> 00:13:34,245
It could have taken
our satellites to Mars

144
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:37,286
Jupiter, Mercury, like NASA does!

145
00:13:39,995 --> 00:13:43,245
Rakesh, meet Mr Rupert Desai!

146
00:13:45,411 --> 00:13:46,495
Met.

147
00:13:47,245 --> 00:13:49,786
Mr Rupert Desai is from NASA.

148
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:51,828
He arrived yesterday from Houston.

149
00:13:52,036 --> 00:13:54,953
Pioneer 10, 11, Cassini...

150
00:13:55,161 --> 00:14:00,161
He is behind many of America's
successful space missions.

151
00:14:00,328 --> 00:14:01,995
And, he's an Indian!

152
00:14:02,328 --> 00:14:06,495
We are thrilled that he
will now work for his own country

153
00:14:06,578 --> 00:14:11,495
and will take charge of
all our flagship space missions

154
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:16,536
Including the GSLV Fatboy
relaunch program in Bangalore.

155
00:14:21,286 --> 00:14:25,620
I think you have forgotten
one of my most important achievement...

156
00:14:25,828 --> 00:14:28,495
After spending 23 years in NASA...

157
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:30,161
I haven't forgotten Hindi!

158
00:14:32,536 --> 00:14:37,911
With all due respect,
today NASA is 50 years ahead of ISRO...

159
00:14:38,036 --> 00:14:39,828
It's nothing to be ashamed about

160
00:14:40,036 --> 00:14:42,245
On the contrary, it's to our advantage

161
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:46,411
We should borrow from NASA's
knowledge and build on it.

162
00:14:46,911 --> 00:14:47,745
Look at China!

163
00:14:48,203 --> 00:14:51,328
They borrow, build and fly!

164
00:14:52,203 --> 00:14:55,661
Why should we spend our taxpayers'...

165
00:14:55,786 --> 00:14:59,578
...hard earned money on these useless...

166
00:14:59,995 --> 00:15:02,953
..."Make everything in India" experiments?

167
00:15:03,036 --> 00:15:04,578
Is this a Cow or a Bull?

168
00:15:09,786 --> 00:15:10,578
Sorry...

169
00:15:10,661 --> 00:15:11,995
What were you saying?

170
00:15:13,828 --> 00:15:14,953
Borrow from NASA?

171
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,661
Gentlemen, we are scientists...

172
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:23,161
And there is no science
without experiments.

173
00:15:23,411 --> 00:15:25,995
Experiment means to try things out...

174
00:15:26,203 --> 00:15:27,620
And learn.

175
00:15:27,828 --> 00:15:33,245
If we don't experiment we have
no right to call ourselves scientists.

176
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,203
What do you think,
Mr Rupert?

177
00:15:35,495 --> 00:15:37,245
Did NASA become NASA without failing?

178
00:15:37,745 --> 00:15:40,620
Weren't Apollo 1 and
Columbia their failures?

179
00:15:41,203 --> 00:15:45,203
If we look to NASA to solve all
our problems...

180
00:15:46,911 --> 00:15:47,911
...we will be finished!

181
00:15:48,661 --> 00:15:51,120
Let's make it in India, for India...

182
00:15:51,245 --> 00:15:54,453
We can sir and we will succeed sir!

183
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:55,953
Rakesh...

184
00:15:57,036 --> 00:15:58,953
forget about the past...

185
00:15:59,411 --> 00:16:01,578
And focus on the future!

186
00:16:03,328 --> 00:16:06,120
I didn't understand sir...

187
00:16:06,495 --> 00:16:09,203
Forget the past, focus on the future!

188
00:16:09,286 --> 00:16:12,578
Thanks for the translation,
but I still didn't get your point sir.

189
00:16:13,078 --> 00:16:16,536
All this GSLV Fatboy and all that...

190
00:16:17,203 --> 00:16:19,078
forget it...

191
00:16:19,495 --> 00:16:21,953
Think 2022.

192
00:16:22,828 --> 00:16:26,328
We want you to get India
ready for the Mars mission!

193
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:31,953
Mars...

194
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:35,995
Mars Mission...

195
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,411
I am serious, Rakesh

196
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:44,995
Sir, the one mission that all
of ISRO knows, will never happen.

197
00:16:46,203 --> 00:16:48,661
Whose idea was it to transfer me
and bury me alive?

198
00:16:48,786 --> 00:16:51,495
It's a very good posting.
Mission Director, Grade 4!

199
00:16:53,786 --> 00:16:55,328
Sir, I know it's a government job...

200
00:16:55,745 --> 00:17:00,578
You can't fire me, so you are doing
everything to make me resign quietly

201
00:17:01,203 --> 00:17:05,620
I could resign, join a private
company and earn millions...

202
00:17:05,995 --> 00:17:09,495
But the thing is,
I am from this old school.

203
00:17:11,203 --> 00:17:14,036
A great man once told me...

204
00:17:14,578 --> 00:17:16,911
that my becoming a
Scientist has no meaning

205
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:21,203
if my science is
of no use to my country.

206
00:17:24,453 --> 00:17:27,161
Instead of begging NASA for help,
ask yourselves...

207
00:17:27,245 --> 00:17:31,245
Mr India who's standing with
a bull outside the Space Club...

208
00:17:32,286 --> 00:17:36,411
How do we get him in?

209
00:17:36,872 --> 00:17:40,870
<i>(Humming)
I learnt everything but I didn't learn how to be smart...</i>

210
00:17:40,953 --> 00:17:41,953
Excuse me, gentlemen

211
00:17:45,036 --> 00:17:45,995
Mars Mission!!

212
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:47,328
Rakesh!

213
00:17:49,161 --> 00:17:50,536
Rakesh, I'm sorry

214
00:17:50,575 --> 00:17:51,911
It's strange, sir!

215
00:17:52,203 --> 00:17:54,328
All these years I didn't have
the time to think about anything else

216
00:17:54,745 --> 00:17:57,620
now I have the time,
but nothing to think about!

217
00:17:58,078 --> 00:17:59,578
My mind is completely empty.

218
00:18:01,453 --> 00:18:03,995
You think, I should have
thought of marriage?

219
00:18:04,286 --> 00:18:06,203
Started a family?

220
00:18:08,036 --> 00:18:09,036
I don't even have a hobby.

221
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:12,328
Life has been all about just
science and space!

222
00:18:14,203 --> 00:18:14,953
No problem, sir

223
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,661
There is Mars...
Time will pass

224
00:18:19,411 --> 00:18:20,286
But thank you sir

225
00:18:21,203 --> 00:18:22,036
Have a good day.

226
00:18:26,495 --> 00:18:27,203
What the hell, Dilip?

227
00:18:27,245 --> 00:18:28,328
- Chill, dad
- How dare you?

228
00:18:28,411 --> 00:18:30,661
- What's wrong, I'm just exploring!
- I'm not going to tolerate this, Dilip.

229
00:18:30,786 --> 00:18:31,828
What's wrong?

230
00:18:32,161 --> 00:18:32,828
What's wrong?

231
00:18:33,203 --> 00:18:34,203
This is all your fault!

232
00:18:35,203 --> 00:18:35,828
What's this?

233
00:18:36,286 --> 00:18:36,995
A book

234
00:18:37,411 --> 00:18:38,536
It's the Quran!

235
00:18:39,203 --> 00:18:40,203
The Quran is a book, right?

236
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,078
Is reading a book banned in this house?

237
00:18:42,911 --> 00:18:43,536
Logic!

238
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,370
What logic?

239
00:18:44,578 --> 00:18:45,245
Just look at him.

240
00:18:45,328 --> 00:18:47,828
Look at that beard!
Or can't you see that as well?

241
00:18:48,203 --> 00:18:48,911
Sunil enough!

242
00:18:48,995 --> 00:18:50,203
Excuse me, hello...hello...hello...

243
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:52,286
I have the right
to choose the way I want to live.

244
00:18:53,203 --> 00:18:57,453
You will live the way I want you
to live as long as you are in my house!

245
00:18:57,745 --> 00:18:58,661
My house?

246
00:18:59,495 --> 00:19:00,578
Ok, we will come to that later...

247
00:19:00,661 --> 00:19:03,578
Dilip why this sudden interest in Islam?

248
00:19:04,495 --> 00:19:05,661
Mom, you won't get it!

249
00:19:05,786 --> 00:19:06,328
Try me!

250
00:19:06,453 --> 00:19:08,828
Don't try...
Give him a slap!

251
00:19:09,161 --> 00:19:10,786
Sunil, leave the room,
I'll speak to him.

252
00:19:10,995 --> 00:19:12,620
Ask him if he has paid the
electricity bill...

253
00:19:12,745 --> 00:19:13,745
- Dilip!
- You...

254
00:19:14,745 --> 00:19:15,453
You go

255
00:19:15,661 --> 00:19:16,745
Everyone's over smart!

256
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:40,529
Mars department has been
given special treatment!

257
00:19:42,321 --> 00:19:47,821
<i>(Humming)
Where have we arrived...</i>

258
00:19:48,529 --> 00:19:53,446
<i>(Humming)
Walking together for so long...</i>

259
00:19:54,154 --> 00:19:56,446
What a thoughtfully designed office!

260
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,112
It feels like Mars
as soon as you step in!

261
00:20:01,404 --> 00:20:03,654
Is there water on Mars...?

262
00:20:04,487 --> 00:20:05,362
Let's see...

263
00:20:10,612 --> 00:20:11,821
Only a little

264
00:20:14,862 --> 00:20:16,446
There's Oxygen...
but less.

265
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:20,779
There's life here!

266
00:20:23,821 --> 00:20:24,862
Hello!

267
00:20:25,654 --> 00:20:27,987
Myself Rakesh Dhawan

268
00:20:29,154 --> 00:20:30,237
Yourself?

269
00:20:31,446 --> 00:20:32,904
Meowars?
Nice.

270
00:20:34,154 --> 00:20:35,696
How do you like this planet?

271
00:20:36,071 --> 00:20:37,696
Time moves in slow motion here

272
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:39,112
Like...

273
00:20:40,612 --> 00:20:41,779
You know why?

274
00:20:42,487 --> 00:20:46,904
Because the Mars orbit around the
Sun is 1.5 times larger than Earth's.

275
00:20:47,237 --> 00:20:51,821
Which means your birthday comes
only once in 2 years...

276
00:20:58,612 --> 00:20:59,779
She ran away

277
00:21:01,779 --> 00:21:03,362
Yes, Tara tell me.

278
00:21:05,779 --> 00:21:07,154
I'm sorry, sir.

279
00:21:08,321 --> 00:21:09,904
This is just not fair!

280
00:21:10,487 --> 00:21:11,321
I'm sorry, sir.

281
00:21:14,196 --> 00:21:15,279
Don't be jealous Tara.

282
00:21:16,612 --> 00:21:20,404
Just because you didn't get to work
on the Mars mission, means it's not fair?

283
00:21:21,112 --> 00:21:22,237
You have to earn it!

284
00:21:22,904 --> 00:21:23,779
Earn this!

285
00:21:25,154 --> 00:21:26,821
I can't sleep nowadays

286
00:21:27,548 --> 00:21:28,862
So change your pillow!

287
00:21:29,946 --> 00:21:31,321
How can I sleep sir?

288
00:21:31,987 --> 00:21:33,571
Because of me...

289
00:21:35,112 --> 00:21:39,446
I can't see one of the world's finest
scientists being destroyed like this!

290
00:21:39,529 --> 00:21:41,821
Tara, don't worry about me,
just go and do your job.

291
00:21:42,446 --> 00:21:43,946
What job! How can I...

292
00:21:44,071 --> 00:21:47,279
GSLV Fat Boy...
Get it ready by 2022...

293
00:21:47,446 --> 00:21:49,237
You have 10-12 years,
enough time...

294
00:21:50,112 --> 00:21:52,946
You'll miss my songs for
a few days, that's it!

295
00:21:53,404 --> 00:21:57,279
I will sing at ISRO's annual function...

296
00:21:59,362 --> 00:22:02,362
Take your time!
We have all the time in the world...

297
00:22:03,321 --> 00:22:04,279
Come in.

298
00:22:05,821 --> 00:22:06,779
Ma'am

299
00:22:08,237 --> 00:22:11,154
Ma'am, the gas is running out!

300
00:22:11,404 --> 00:22:13,946
The oil is hot right?
Switch it off.

301
00:22:14,112 --> 00:22:14,821
Fry the bread

302
00:22:15,362 --> 00:22:18,446
By the time the oil cools down
you can fry all the bread

303
00:22:18,654 --> 00:22:21,196
The cylinder may come by evening!
Keep the gas off.

304
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:24,404
The world's most powerful
rocket is getting ready at NASA

305
00:22:24,696 --> 00:22:25,904
At a budget of Rs. 60 billion...

306
00:22:26,654 --> 00:22:30,196
It will carry American satellite
Maven to Mars

307
00:22:30,987 --> 00:22:32,446
Tara, look at your son...

308
00:22:36,404 --> 00:22:38,154
You couldn't save your rocket
from drowning

309
00:22:38,404 --> 00:22:39,904
at least save your son!

310
00:22:40,654 --> 00:22:42,279
He is reading Namaz!

311
00:22:43,154 --> 00:22:44,779
If you wanted to live in
space all your life

312
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:45,987
why did you have children?

313
00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:49,529
Since you've had children
learn to give them space, dad...

314
00:22:50,071 --> 00:22:51,529
I will slap your face okay!

315
00:22:53,321 --> 00:22:55,404
Mom, America is going to Mars?

316
00:22:56,279 --> 00:22:57,862
Do you know what Mars is called in Urdu?

317
00:22:58,279 --> 00:22:59,321
Behraam!

318
00:22:59,529 --> 00:23:00,654
Shut up!

319
00:23:00,904 --> 00:23:02,987
Ma'am, you're so smart!

320
00:23:03,737 --> 00:23:04,737
All the bread has been fried!

321
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:09,696
To go to Mars, we have to get past
Earth's gravitational force

322
00:23:09,987 --> 00:23:11,487
India does not have a powerful rocket...

323
00:23:11,529 --> 00:23:13,487
that can carry that much fuel.

324
00:23:14,071 --> 00:23:16,654
Had GSLV been a success,
it may have been possible...

325
00:23:16,904 --> 00:23:19,237
Mars is around 60 million
kilometres away from Earth,

326
00:23:19,529 --> 00:23:23,571
Only American rockets have the
fuel capacity for this mission

327
00:23:24,862 --> 00:23:28,654
India has only reached
the Moon so far...

328
00:23:31,071 --> 00:23:33,154
Where are you going?
You're on holiday!

329
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,446
Rakesh sir!

330
00:23:41,529 --> 00:23:43,071
The rocket goes up and
leaves a satellite in space...

331
00:23:43,154 --> 00:23:43,529
Sorry!

332
00:23:46,487 --> 00:23:47,362
Sir!

333
00:23:47,904 --> 00:23:51,779
Sir, America has announced
the launch of Maven for Mars

334
00:23:52,154 --> 00:23:52,987
In 2 years.

335
00:23:53,154 --> 00:23:54,279
2013 take off!

336
00:23:54,362 --> 00:23:55,279
I'm happy for them.

337
00:23:55,446 --> 00:23:56,821
Why can't we do it sir?

338
00:23:58,446 --> 00:24:01,071
Boy! Get ma'am a cup of tea.

339
00:24:02,071 --> 00:24:03,154
And some medicine.

340
00:24:04,196 --> 00:24:05,779
Get your health checked,
you don't look well.

341
00:24:05,946 --> 00:24:08,321
Sir, we can go to Mars too!

342
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,529
Sir, I know after my mess-up

343
00:24:12,154 --> 00:24:14,279
it's hard for you to trust me.

344
00:24:14,529 --> 00:24:16,529
But trust me sir, a final time.

345
00:24:16,987 --> 00:24:19,737
To the right, is the rocket
that can take us to Mars.

346
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:25,529
This?

347
00:24:25,696 --> 00:24:26,946
My right sir...

348
00:24:27,779 --> 00:24:28,862
Oh, sorry

349
00:24:32,487 --> 00:24:33,154
This?

350
00:24:34,237 --> 00:24:36,779
Boy! Make that tea strong

351
00:24:38,529 --> 00:24:41,487
That is a PSLV rocket!
It's a small boy

352
00:24:41,529 --> 00:24:42,654
It can only reach the moon

353
00:24:43,529 --> 00:24:44,654
Sir, I know!

354
00:24:44,946 --> 00:24:47,196
Tara, in case you've forgotten...

355
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:49,862
what you learnt in class 4...

356
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:51,321
We are here...

357
00:24:53,529 --> 00:24:58,529
The moon is right here!
Mars is all the way there

358
00:24:59,487 --> 00:25:00,404
We can go sir...

359
00:25:00,612 --> 00:25:01,529
in PSLV!

360
00:25:01,612 --> 00:25:02,946
Let me try again

361
00:25:03,529 --> 00:25:07,362
You can take a Rickshaw to
Mahatma Gandhi Road, not to Meerut!

362
00:25:07,487 --> 00:25:11,529
The Rickshaw can go anywhere
if the Rickshaw driver is willing!

363
00:25:12,446 --> 00:25:13,654
Will you go to Mars?

364
00:25:16,112 --> 00:25:17,196
What did you eat this morning?

365
00:25:17,404 --> 00:25:19,696
Fried bread...

366
00:25:41,571 --> 00:25:43,321
Come! Come, come!

367
00:25:49,737 --> 00:25:50,654
Bring the table here.

368
00:25:53,321 --> 00:25:55,529
Careful!

369
00:25:56,487 --> 00:25:57,654
- The gas is on?
- Yes, sir

370
00:25:57,821 --> 00:26:00,362
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

371
00:26:00,529 --> 00:26:02,237
You can't light a fire inside,
have you gone nuts?!

372
00:26:02,904 --> 00:26:04,612
There's billions of dollars
worth of equipment here

373
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:08,404
you can't bring this in here!
Excuse me, are you the canteen lady?

374
00:26:08,654 --> 00:26:09,529
Get her out of here!

375
00:26:09,696 --> 00:26:11,779
She's Tara Shinde,
project director, Mars Mission.

376
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:12,654
What...

377
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:13,779
- Good morning, sir
- Project director!?

378
00:26:14,536 --> 00:26:16,313
Is this some sort of a joke?

379
00:26:16,376 --> 00:26:17,779
No, it's not a joke.

380
00:26:17,852 --> 00:26:18,987
It's a Fried bread!

381
00:26:19,237 --> 00:26:20,737
Sir! Can you...?

382
00:26:23,071 --> 00:26:24,821
Put this goddamn thing off!

383
00:26:25,487 --> 00:26:26,529
What are you guys doing?

384
00:26:27,529 --> 00:26:30,279
Gas is off...Bread is on...

385
00:26:32,154 --> 00:26:35,779
When the oil is hot enough to fry the
bread, why make it hotter?

386
00:26:36,196 --> 00:26:38,737
Switch it off, save the
gas and continue frying.

387
00:26:38,987 --> 00:26:41,321
When the oil cools,
turn the gas on again.

388
00:26:42,112 --> 00:26:44,404
A lot of Indian homes save fuel this way.

389
00:26:44,612 --> 00:26:47,904
We want to use this Home Science
technique, to go to Mars!

390
00:26:48,862 --> 00:26:49,612
What?

391
00:26:50,321 --> 00:26:52,446
Have you lost your mind?

392
00:26:52,821 --> 00:26:53,737
Tara, take over

393
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:55,696
Yes sir, please take over.

394
00:26:58,321 --> 00:27:00,362
Sir! What's going on?

395
00:27:00,529 --> 00:27:04,446
We propose to launch the Mars
satellite in 24 months from now

396
00:27:04,737 --> 00:27:06,112
using the PSLV rocket!

397
00:27:06,237 --> 00:27:07,154
PSLV?

398
00:27:08,196 --> 00:27:09,529
- How?
- Patience.

399
00:27:09,862 --> 00:27:10,779
Patience.

400
00:27:11,112 --> 00:27:13,946
We know that we need
a lot of fuel to go to Mars

401
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,446
and the PSLV has a low fuel capacity.

402
00:27:16,779 --> 00:27:17,446
We know...

403
00:27:17,529 --> 00:27:20,112
We became scientists before you.
Tara, please continue.

404
00:27:20,204 --> 00:27:22,904
The PSLV can't take
the satellite all the way

405
00:27:23,024 --> 00:27:26,112
but can leave it here
in the earth's orbit easily.

406
00:27:26,352 --> 00:27:31,071
So, when the satellite reaches
the Perigee...

407
00:27:31,196 --> 00:27:35,862
we will fire the satellite engine with
a little fuel and switch off

408
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,237
Like we did with the bread

409
00:27:37,321 --> 00:27:40,696
This firing force will increase
the speed of the satellite...

410
00:27:40,779 --> 00:27:43,154
...and propel it further away
from Earth into a higher orbit.

411
00:27:43,529 --> 00:27:45,279
When it comes back here...

412
00:27:45,362 --> 00:27:47,821
Little fuel, fire, switch off.

413
00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:51,279
Speed will increase and it will go
into an even higher orbit

414
00:27:51,571 --> 00:27:54,237
We keep doing this till finally...

415
00:27:54,404 --> 00:27:56,196
...when the satellite is
at the perigee again

416
00:27:56,487 --> 00:27:57,737
the speed will be so much that...

417
00:27:57,946 --> 00:28:01,112
a final strong firing force...

418
00:28:01,321 --> 00:28:04,946
will throw it out of the earth's
gravitational sphere of influence...

419
00:28:05,112 --> 00:28:06,446
like a sling shot.

420
00:28:06,946 --> 00:28:10,321
We will use gravitational
force to beat gravity.

421
00:28:10,654 --> 00:28:13,529
This way, using less fuel
we can reach Mars.

422
00:28:13,987 --> 00:28:16,237
Not straight, but curved!

423
00:28:16,904 --> 00:28:18,154
Wow!

424
00:28:18,987 --> 00:28:21,112
So this is how you
guys work around here?

425
00:28:21,487 --> 00:28:22,946
On fried bread ideas!

426
00:28:23,321 --> 00:28:25,196
Sir, this is actually
based on Hohmann's theory

427
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,696
Hohmann's theory is 100 years old!

428
00:28:28,987 --> 00:28:30,987
It is obsolete!
It's outdated!

429
00:28:31,612 --> 00:28:34,390
This is madness!

430
00:28:34,487 --> 00:28:38,737
No Rupert,
it's not as mad as it seems...

431
00:28:39,737 --> 00:28:41,279
There might be an idea here

432
00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:45,362
Now you will ask what's
the hurry to launch...

433
00:28:45,529 --> 00:28:50,279
Once in 3 years trajectory from
Earth to Mars is shortest

434
00:28:50,696 --> 00:28:53,362
If we want to reach Mars on this date

435
00:28:53,446 --> 00:28:56,737
we have to launch 11 months earlier!

436
00:28:56,821 --> 00:29:00,946
If we waste time debating,
Mars will move away

437
00:29:01,112 --> 00:29:03,362
and we will have to wait until 2017!

438
00:29:03,571 --> 00:29:05,612
I can't even believe
we're discussing this.

439
00:29:05,946 --> 00:29:10,362
This rocket does not have
the capacity to even carry the weight

440
00:29:10,487 --> 00:29:12,112
of the satellite it's
supposed to take with it.

441
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:14,696
Rakesh, that's a point

442
00:29:15,529 --> 00:29:18,654
The load capacity of
the PSLV rocket is very low.

443
00:29:20,404 --> 00:29:26,487
How will it carry such
a complex and heavy satellite?

444
00:29:26,654 --> 00:29:29,112
The kind of satellite
that we need to study Mars!

445
00:29:29,612 --> 00:29:32,654
So we can try and make
a lighter satellite!

446
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:36,529
Advanced countries
have failed so many times.

447
00:29:36,821 --> 00:29:38,071
America 4 times

448
00:29:38,529 --> 00:29:40,529
Russia 8 times...

449
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:43,612
and you are saying India
will succeed the very first time?

450
00:29:43,904 --> 00:29:45,404
Why do you want the
world to laugh at us?

451
00:29:45,529 --> 00:29:50,071
Rakesh, your idea is very good,
but Rupert is right.

452
00:29:50,946 --> 00:29:55,112
Before we plan deep space missions,
there's a lot of work we need to do.

453
00:29:55,196 --> 00:29:58,112
Our space program is way
behind that of America and Russia!

454
00:29:58,571 --> 00:30:01,112
Let's try in the future. Let's see.

455
00:30:03,112 --> 00:30:05,154
Sir, could I have a
word with you in private?

456
00:30:16,529 --> 00:30:17,071
Sir!

457
00:30:17,237 --> 00:30:18,904
What the...Is this a circus?

458
00:30:19,821 --> 00:30:20,987
India is behind.

459
00:30:21,612 --> 00:30:24,654
And will remain behind
unless we leap forward.

460
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,946
Till now, no country in the world
has reached Mars in the first attempt.

461
00:30:30,696 --> 00:30:31,946
Rupert just told us...

462
00:30:32,237 --> 00:30:34,946
Russia 8 times, America 4 times,
China is still trying...

463
00:30:35,321 --> 00:30:36,154
Just think,

464
00:30:36,446 --> 00:30:37,404
if India

465
00:30:37,737 --> 00:30:41,071
In its first attempt manages
to reach Mars, what could happen?

466
00:30:41,321 --> 00:30:42,737
Everyone will lose their minds!

467
00:30:43,196 --> 00:30:44,279
What...

468
00:30:45,196 --> 00:30:48,321
Sir, today we are
tail-enders for the world.

469
00:30:48,904 --> 00:30:50,654
Tomorrow we can be opening batsmen.

470
00:30:51,529 --> 00:30:54,362
Let's not take singles,
let's hit a sixer

471
00:30:54,487 --> 00:30:57,487
This is great, first it was cooking,
and now it's cricket!

472
00:30:57,737 --> 00:30:59,529
Rakesh, we have a lot of work to do.

473
00:30:59,779 --> 00:31:02,237
Will you please excuse us?

474
00:31:02,404 --> 00:31:06,237
Rakesh, it will take 4
or 5 years to make a satellite.

475
00:31:06,404 --> 00:31:08,196
How will we launch in 24 months?

476
00:31:08,946 --> 00:31:09,737
I know, sir.

477
00:31:10,571 --> 00:31:13,279
We work 9 to 5.

478
00:31:13,529 --> 00:31:15,529
8 hours, actually 7 hours,

479
00:31:15,612 --> 00:31:16,987
1 hour for lunch break.

480
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,404
If we do this as a government job,
it will take 4 years.

481
00:31:19,904 --> 00:31:24,904
But if we work 15 hours a day
it should be done in 20 months, sir!

482
00:31:27,812 --> 00:31:28,904
Tell me, what do you need?

483
00:31:29,237 --> 00:31:30,487
Team, sir! Team!

484
00:31:30,737 --> 00:31:32,112
- Sir, you can't be serious!

485
00:31:32,237 --> 00:31:33,696
making a satellite takes a
little more than frying bread sir

486
00:31:33,862 --> 00:31:37,797
We need 6-7 department heads
and at least 400 support crew!

487
00:31:37,883 --> 00:31:40,487
We want Mr.Padmanabhan
as head of satellite design.

488
00:31:40,571 --> 00:31:42,196
Mr. Anirudh for Communications.

489
00:31:42,362 --> 00:31:43,404
Mr. Kamath for...

490
00:31:43,487 --> 00:31:45,071
You've come with a list?

491
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,112
That confident?

492
00:31:47,446 --> 00:31:48,404
We don't have any time sir.

493
00:31:49,487 --> 00:31:51,279
Give the list to Mr Rupert.

494
00:31:51,862 --> 00:31:53,112
He will do the needful.

495
00:31:53,362 --> 00:31:55,362
This is subject to budget approval.

496
00:31:55,446 --> 00:31:55,946
Yes, sir.

497
00:31:56,154 --> 00:31:58,737
Can you send me
the project report in a week?

498
00:31:58,821 --> 00:32:00,362
You'll get it in 3 days sir!

499
00:32:00,446 --> 00:32:01,487
Sir...I-I can't...

500
00:32:01,529 --> 00:32:02,404
Thank you, sir.

501
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:03,987
Thank you very much.

502
00:32:04,196 --> 00:32:05,529
Come, before they change their minds

503
00:32:05,571 --> 00:32:07,862
Sir, I can't spare Mr. Padmanabhan!

504
00:32:07,987 --> 00:32:09,571
You came fully prepared?

505
00:32:09,654 --> 00:32:11,112
Yes sir! Sorry...

506
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:11,985
Hello?

507
00:32:13,779 --> 00:32:15,446
I'll call you back...

508
00:32:16,904 --> 00:32:17,654
What happened?

509
00:32:18,383 --> 00:32:20,196
I don't know whether to laugh or cry!

510
00:32:20,446 --> 00:32:22,654
Laugh! Better choice.
What happened?

511
00:32:23,446 --> 00:32:26,487
My son Dilip! He learnt to
play the keyboard just last year.

512
00:32:27,321 --> 00:32:29,571
He's a big fan of A R Rahman...
His name was Dilip too.

513
00:32:30,321 --> 00:32:33,154
So this fool thinks if he becomes a Muslim...

514
00:32:33,404 --> 00:32:35,612
He can be a Hollywood music
director and win an Oscar!

515
00:32:36,112 --> 00:32:37,237
Interesting...

516
00:32:37,529 --> 00:32:42,071
Can't take this religion war
between father and son

517
00:32:42,904 --> 00:32:44,779
Take the day off today.
Go home.

518
00:32:44,946 --> 00:32:47,821
We only finished 7 hours of work today,
8 are remaining!

519
00:32:51,196 --> 00:32:52,237
Is this the time to come home?

520
00:32:52,404 --> 00:32:54,404
I had extra classes, dad.
What do I do?

521
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:12,529
Weren't you going to resign?

522
00:33:13,362 --> 00:33:14,321
Have you eaten?

523
00:33:15,529 --> 00:33:16,737
What's the point of this job?

524
00:33:17,446 --> 00:33:19,487
Look around, no one's happy!

525
00:33:19,821 --> 00:33:20,987
Enough, Sunil.

526
00:33:22,196 --> 00:33:26,112
How will anyone be happy if you stop them
from doing what makes them happy?

527
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:45,279
Sir they need a team fast

528
00:33:45,696 --> 00:33:48,154
They want to go to Mars in PSLV!

529
00:33:49,487 --> 00:33:51,112
You got to be kidding me!

530
00:33:51,737 --> 00:33:55,821
It's a complete waste of time,
money and energy

531
00:33:56,446 --> 00:33:57,737
Sir, I don't decide that

532
00:33:58,404 --> 00:33:59,862
Please give them some people

533
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:02,071
People with less
experience will do, sir.

534
00:34:07,529 --> 00:34:09,112
Sir, where should I place this monitor?

535
00:34:09,237 --> 00:34:10,279
On my head

536
00:34:10,529 --> 00:34:13,237
Instead of the experts we requested for...

537
00:34:13,737 --> 00:34:16,237
We have been assigned
their juniors!

538
00:34:16,571 --> 00:34:17,987
How can they do this?

539
00:34:18,862 --> 00:34:20,862
We need people with
the maximum experience!

540
00:34:21,446 --> 00:34:24,279
Seems like Mr. Rupert Desai
doesn't want this mission to succeed!

541
00:34:25,112 --> 00:34:25,904
Varsha Chillai!

542
00:34:25,987 --> 00:34:27,529
Not Chillai, sir.
Pillai!

543
00:34:28,821 --> 00:34:30,654
I've packed your favourite today...
potato paratha.

544
00:34:30,987 --> 00:34:32,237
Give me plain bread...

545
00:34:34,779 --> 00:34:36,612
I already look like a potato!

546
00:34:36,904 --> 00:34:41,362
Good choice to design a
lightweight satellite!

547
00:34:43,654 --> 00:34:46,571
I know, I know...
I have no right to talk about weight!

548
00:34:51,612 --> 00:34:56,212
Have you no shame doing
all this in the living room?

549
00:34:56,274 --> 00:35:00,237
Mom, because you have
taken over our room...

550
00:35:00,612 --> 00:35:04,987
This is now our bedroom

551
00:35:09,279 --> 00:35:10,112
Where do I keep this?

552
00:35:10,571 --> 00:35:11,862
In the morning there was a table here...

553
00:35:12,362 --> 00:35:13,529
where has it gone?

554
00:35:19,737 --> 00:35:22,529
At our place a table is a table
and a sofa is a sofa...

555
00:35:23,196 --> 00:35:24,904
Don't start your nonsense

556
00:35:25,779 --> 00:35:29,737
Thanks to my wife we are able to
fit so much into this small house...

557
00:35:30,237 --> 00:35:31,154
including you!

558
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:35,196
She can fit everything anywhere...

559
00:35:35,446 --> 00:35:37,571
Except a child inside her!

560
00:35:45,279 --> 00:35:46,946
When will I see your obituary?

561
00:35:59,071 --> 00:36:02,654
Navigation and Communication...
Kritika Agarwal!

562
00:36:03,071 --> 00:36:06,362
Ma'am, hands always
on the 10 and 2 positions!

563
00:36:06,946 --> 00:36:08,362
- Hands on the wheel!
- 10! 10!

564
00:36:08,696 --> 00:36:09,321
10!

565
00:36:09,362 --> 00:36:10,237
10 and 2 positions!

566
00:36:10,904 --> 00:36:11,987
Okay, ready!

567
00:36:12,529 --> 00:36:13,862
She has no mission experience.

568
00:36:14,265 --> 00:36:15,336
She's inexperienced, sir.

569
00:36:15,529 --> 00:36:17,696
Ma'am, don't lean forward.
Sit back!

570
00:36:17,779 --> 00:36:19,654
- How will I see...
- Back, back!

571
00:36:20,362 --> 00:36:21,571
Now drive straight ahead.

572
00:36:21,821 --> 00:36:22,487
Okay!

573
00:36:23,237 --> 00:36:27,071
That's the accelerator, press
the clutch and put it into third gear

574
00:36:27,571 --> 00:36:28,529
Okay!

575
00:36:28,654 --> 00:36:30,279
Look ahead!

576
00:36:30,696 --> 00:36:31,696
I am!

577
00:36:32,112 --> 00:36:33,446
Don't take your eyes off the road.

578
00:36:33,654 --> 00:36:34,821
Now put it into fourth gear...

579
00:36:35,112 --> 00:36:36,529
- Fourth gear?
- Yes.

580
00:36:36,904 --> 00:36:37,821
Go ahead...

581
00:36:44,886 --> 00:36:46,446
Sorry...

582
00:36:52,328 --> 00:36:53,196
Neha.S

583
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:55,446
Where are you from?

584
00:36:55,779 --> 00:36:56,529
Lucknow

585
00:36:56,571 --> 00:36:58,446
No cooking
meat in the house

586
00:36:58,696 --> 00:36:59,737
The gates close at 10.

587
00:36:59,821 --> 00:37:03,696
No problem, sir.
I saw the details online, I know.

588
00:37:04,696 --> 00:37:06,487
No boyfriends.

589
00:37:06,571 --> 00:37:07,654
That problem won't be there

590
00:37:07,987 --> 00:37:10,446
Twenty thousand rent.
Hundred thousand deposit.

591
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:12,196
Will you take a Cheque?

592
00:37:12,279 --> 00:37:13,446
Yes.
Don't cross it.

593
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:18,237
Neha ji, give me your full name
and permanent address

594
00:37:18,321 --> 00:37:19,196
and I'll have the agreement made.

595
00:37:19,321 --> 00:37:19,946
Neha Siddiqui.

596
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,404
Number 73, Gomti Nagar Lucknow...

597
00:37:21,487 --> 00:37:22,112
Siddiqui?

598
00:37:22,529 --> 00:37:23,112
Yes.

599
00:37:23,237 --> 00:37:24,112
Are you a Muslim?

600
00:37:24,321 --> 00:37:24,946
Yes.

601
00:37:26,529 --> 00:37:29,404
today is Tuesday...

602
00:37:29,946 --> 00:37:30,904
Not a good day...

603
00:37:31,696 --> 00:37:33,529
We'll fix the date
over the phone tomorrow.

604
00:37:33,987 --> 00:37:36,612
I don't need the cheque today!

605
00:37:43,112 --> 00:37:44,112
She looks nice!

606
00:37:44,612 --> 00:37:45,529
Next!

607
00:37:47,821 --> 00:37:48,904
Eka Gandhi.

608
00:37:49,154 --> 00:37:49,862
She also...!

609
00:37:49,946 --> 00:37:51,321
Propulsion Engineer

610
00:38:05,112 --> 00:38:05,946
Get up and leave

611
00:38:06,446 --> 00:38:07,571
the maid will be here soon

612
00:38:07,946 --> 00:38:10,487
She'll go crazy if she sees
a new face again!

613
00:38:21,529 --> 00:38:24,071
Power cut again!
This country sucks!

614
00:38:26,877 --> 00:38:28,321
What's the hurry?

615
00:38:28,529 --> 00:38:30,071
It's a government job,
where will it go?

616
00:38:30,154 --> 00:38:32,237
I'm working here for
the 3 year experience.

617
00:38:32,321 --> 00:38:34,279
After that I'm flying off to NASA!

618
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:36,654
Have you ever worn a saree?

619
00:38:37,779 --> 00:38:38,987
You will look gorgeous.

620
00:38:39,529 --> 00:38:41,446
You're a typical man of this country...

621
00:38:41,862 --> 00:38:44,404
Want a woman imprisoned
in a saree all her life!

622
00:38:44,987 --> 00:38:46,112
Can you get out now, please?

623
00:38:46,446 --> 00:38:47,696
Can you lend me 5000 bucks?

624
00:38:50,571 --> 00:38:51,529
Is that your nightly rate?

625
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,591
Looks like an All women's club!

626
00:38:58,747 --> 00:38:59,904
Excuse me?

627
00:39:00,779 --> 00:39:01,696
No just...

628
00:39:01,779 --> 00:39:04,404
if there was another man to talk to...

629
00:39:05,071 --> 00:39:07,487
Oh, here he is! Parmeshwar Joshi...

630
00:39:07,529 --> 00:39:10,321
Your horoscope
is pretty inauspicious

631
00:39:10,821 --> 00:39:12,529
The planets are not
aligned in your favour

632
00:39:12,654 --> 00:39:14,362
...Especially Mars

633
00:39:14,779 --> 00:39:16,362
Saturn is also weighing
down on you

634
00:39:16,446 --> 00:39:21,654
Every girl I meet gets married
to someone else

635
00:39:22,487 --> 00:39:23,654
Any solution for that?

636
00:39:23,779 --> 00:39:27,154
There is only one solution...

637
00:39:27,404 --> 00:39:29,321
You'll have to be careful of Mars

638
00:39:29,362 --> 00:39:32,071
Stay far away from Mars...

639
00:39:32,321 --> 00:39:33,779
Pray to the 9 Gods

640
00:39:33,904 --> 00:39:35,404
Here's my card.

641
00:39:37,612 --> 00:39:39,904
One more! Ananth Iyengar...

642
00:39:46,487 --> 00:39:48,487
- Did Tarun call?
- No

643
00:39:49,071 --> 00:39:53,529
I thought I will retire early and live
with my son in San Francisco

644
00:39:54,237 --> 00:40:00,741
And spend the rest of my life
in a civilised country...

645
00:40:02,862 --> 00:40:04,362
But instead...

646
00:40:08,075 --> 00:40:10,808
Isn't he a bit young for this mission?

647
00:40:11,671 --> 00:40:14,171
Sir this is impossible!

648
00:40:15,171 --> 00:40:17,380
We need an experienced team!
All these people are...

649
00:40:17,505 --> 00:40:22,296
Who has the experience of going
to Mars in ISRO, including you and me?

650
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:22,921
But sir...

651
00:40:22,963 --> 00:40:26,755
In the 1983 World Cup final,
West Indies had Vivian Richards,

652
00:40:27,255 --> 00:40:30,713
Gordon Greenidge,
Malcolm Marshall, Michael Holding,

653
00:40:30,963 --> 00:40:35,963
Andy Roberts, Joel Garner,
Jefferey Dujon, Clive Lloyd...

654
00:40:36,005 --> 00:40:37,505
And we had?

655
00:40:37,796 --> 00:40:41,671
Kapil Dev could have also told
the selectors, 'this is impossible...

656
00:40:42,796 --> 00:40:47,880
I want Allan Border, Dennis Lillee,
Ian Botham, Imran Khan...'

657
00:40:48,713 --> 00:40:50,963
The whole world was
sure that the Indian team...

658
00:40:51,046 --> 00:40:53,546
had no chance of winning the World Cup!

659
00:40:53,963 --> 00:40:57,171
So we had no pressure
to win or fear of losing.

660
00:40:57,796 --> 00:40:59,838
We just went and played our game.

661
00:41:00,796 --> 00:41:01,713
And we won!

662
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:04,546
Same, same.

663
00:41:05,088 --> 00:41:06,005
Sports and science.

664
00:41:06,296 --> 00:41:07,213
Sarcasm?

665
00:41:07,671 --> 00:41:09,296
- Sarcasm!
- Mars department?

666
00:41:09,921 --> 00:41:11,880
We think so...Come!

667
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,630
Good morning sir...

668
00:41:14,796 --> 00:41:17,213
Sorry, I had to
go to the Temple today...

669
00:41:17,588 --> 00:41:19,963
Temple offering...

670
00:41:22,296 --> 00:41:24,671
You go to the temple everyday...

671
00:41:24,755 --> 00:41:26,505
Or you went because it's your first day?

672
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,713
No sir...

673
00:41:27,838 --> 00:41:30,005
to pray this would be my last day!

674
00:41:30,296 --> 00:41:34,130
I'm sorry sir, but I can't work here!

675
00:41:35,046 --> 00:41:36,046
Don't you like Tara?

676
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:38,963
No, no! I'm a big fan of both of you...

677
00:41:39,255 --> 00:41:41,046
how shall I say this...?

678
00:41:41,171 --> 00:41:43,171
Try from your mouth...
It's a good option.

679
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:49,171
I'm a virgin sir

680
00:41:49,588 --> 00:41:50,838
I haven't been able to get married

681
00:41:51,005 --> 00:41:53,963
Even the women in Bangkok
look at me and run away, sir...

682
00:41:54,171 --> 00:41:55,213
What?

683
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:57,171
Nothing, boys talk...

684
00:41:57,505 --> 00:41:59,963
Mars is hovering over my head, sir

685
00:42:00,296 --> 00:42:04,255
Priest told me to stay away from Mars

686
00:42:04,755 --> 00:42:07,255
and here we are trying
to get close to it...

687
00:42:07,637 --> 00:42:08,553
Sir

688
00:42:09,755 --> 00:42:10,546
Eka Gandhi

689
00:42:10,713 --> 00:42:12,046
Propulsion Department

690
00:42:24,296 --> 00:42:25,171
Sir...

691
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:30,671
Good morning!

692
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:33,588
Kritika Agarwal

693
00:42:36,296 --> 00:42:38,255
By the way, office begins at 9 am...

694
00:42:50,421 --> 00:42:52,088
- Excuse me?
- Please come in!

695
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:53,546
Neha?

696
00:42:54,088 --> 00:42:55,046
Here...

697
00:42:55,338 --> 00:42:57,546
Project details,
you can go through them.

698
00:43:00,046 --> 00:43:01,005
Sorry ma'am

699
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:02,796
- Varsha?
- Yes

700
00:43:08,963 --> 00:43:10,880
Bangalore is in ruins!

701
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:13,338
No traffic management, nothing

702
00:43:13,588 --> 00:43:16,338
In 1976 when I...

703
00:43:16,671 --> 00:43:17,838
Please sit here...

704
00:43:17,921 --> 00:43:19,880
Please come, sir.

705
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:54,880
What are you doing?

706
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:57,380
Trying to get from Earth to Mars...

707
00:43:57,505 --> 00:43:58,755
How far is it from Earth?

708
00:44:00,046 --> 00:44:01,713
Almost 60 million kilometers

709
00:44:02,088 --> 00:44:02,921
What!

710
00:44:04,421 --> 00:44:06,546
A rocket can get us there in 11 months

711
00:44:07,255 --> 00:44:09,005
Oh, so you're making a rocket!

712
00:44:09,338 --> 00:44:10,213
Nope.

713
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:11,630
There is a rocket.

714
00:44:12,421 --> 00:44:13,338
PSLV.

715
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:17,796
PSLV...Same rocket took us to
the moon 2 years ago, right?

716
00:44:18,505 --> 00:44:20,255
Not bad, you remember!

717
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:25,296
Yes, now we want to send a
satellite to orbit Mars.

718
00:44:26,046 --> 00:44:27,046
So what's the problem?

719
00:44:27,546 --> 00:44:28,546
Put it in and send it!

720
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,171
Wish it were that easy!

721
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:33,671
The moon is easier.

722
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:36,338
It lies within the earth's
gravitational force...

723
00:44:37,963 --> 00:44:40,713
To get to Mars we have
to get through this force.

724
00:44:48,671 --> 00:44:50,005
Give that to me

725
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,963
Go stand in the corner

726
00:44:53,255 --> 00:44:54,921
I'm the Earth.
And you?

727
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:55,963
Your son!

728
00:44:57,505 --> 00:45:00,005
- You are my Mars! Okay?
- Okay

729
00:45:00,171 --> 00:45:01,296
Yo-yo is satellite.

730
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:02,546
- Okay?
- Okay!

731
00:45:02,671 --> 00:45:05,380
The PSLV can only take
the satellite till here

732
00:45:05,838 --> 00:45:07,963
But the earth's gravity
will not let the satellite go

733
00:45:08,171 --> 00:45:09,630
It will rotate it like this, in orbit

734
00:45:09,755 --> 00:45:10,963
Mom careful, it'll break!

735
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:12,255
That's what we want!

736
00:45:12,838 --> 00:45:16,671
Increase the force each time...

737
00:45:17,088 --> 00:45:19,046
until it breaks away from it!

738
00:45:21,088 --> 00:45:22,421
Well done!

739
00:45:24,338 --> 00:45:26,421
If Mars catches our
satellite the same way...

740
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:28,088
then job done!

741
00:45:28,255 --> 00:45:29,296
How will Mars catch it?

742
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:31,296
Just like Earth,
Mars has gravity too

743
00:45:31,713 --> 00:45:34,296
It will catch the satellite
and make it rotate around it

744
00:45:34,838 --> 00:45:39,213
And the satellite will
tell us if there is water...

745
00:45:39,338 --> 00:45:42,505
minerals, chances of life etc on Mars.

746
00:45:42,713 --> 00:45:44,338
The country will benefit
hugely from this!

747
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:46,380
Wow what a technique!

748
00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:48,296
Has anyone gone this way before?

749
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:50,005
That's the joy!

750
00:45:50,296 --> 00:45:52,046
To be first. To be original!

751
00:45:52,796 --> 00:45:55,630
You should be inspired by others,
learn from them...

752
00:45:56,046 --> 00:45:58,505
but find your own path.

753
00:45:59,671 --> 00:46:02,505
Take your field,
look at A R Rahman.

754
00:46:03,671 --> 00:46:06,505
Original icon!
He has found his own path!

755
00:46:10,755 --> 00:46:14,213
In order to reach Mars,
we need 1500 kgs of fuel

756
00:46:14,588 --> 00:46:16,235
And you're saying the total
weight of the satellite...

757
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:18,005
should not exceed 1350 kgs!

758
00:46:18,188 --> 00:46:19,588
How?

759
00:46:19,688 --> 00:46:20,963
We have to reduce the fuel

760
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:29,963
The fuel weight can't exceed this

761
00:46:31,005 --> 00:46:32,213
Let's find a way

762
00:46:33,921 --> 00:46:34,630
What way?

763
00:46:34,755 --> 00:46:37,005
With so little fuel it won't even
cross Bangladesh!

764
00:46:38,255 --> 00:46:39,796
They're messing with Mars!

765
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:41,713
Who knows what will happen...

766
00:46:42,796 --> 00:46:43,921
Let's run away from here

767
00:46:46,588 --> 00:46:47,421
Sir!

768
00:46:48,546 --> 00:46:51,005
We have to reach Mars before you retire

769
00:46:51,130 --> 00:46:53,963
You need young blood for a tough
mission like this, sir!

770
00:46:54,505 --> 00:46:57,213
- My BP's low...
- What's your age?

771
00:46:57,671 --> 00:46:58,671
45?

772
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,505
59!

773
00:47:00,921 --> 00:47:02,005
What are you saying?

774
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:03,671
59?

775
00:47:03,755 --> 00:47:05,671
You don't look a day over 45!

776
00:47:05,963 --> 00:47:08,963
You're glowing! What's your secret?

777
00:47:10,755 --> 00:47:12,005
It's because of my strict diet

778
00:47:12,088 --> 00:47:14,088
Slow down! You'll tire me.

779
00:47:14,383 --> 00:47:16,421
Sir, if anything goes
wrong with the satellite...

780
00:47:16,546 --> 00:47:19,713
it'll take 24 minutes
for our command to reach it.

781
00:47:19,773 --> 00:47:21,505
By then, the damage will be done.

782
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:23,796
The satellite will
just have to repair itself

783
00:47:23,921 --> 00:47:28,046
and we've never attempted
such complex programming before.

784
00:47:28,148 --> 00:47:29,213
Isn't that exciting?

785
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:30,630
It'll be our first time!

786
00:47:31,255 --> 00:47:32,338
Let's do it.

787
00:47:34,588 --> 00:47:35,380
Kritika!

788
00:47:36,213 --> 00:47:40,838
Ma'am only US and Russia have
heavy duty satellite antennas...

789
00:47:40,921 --> 00:47:43,713
for communication between Mars and us.

790
00:47:44,338 --> 00:47:47,338
Since we're short on
time, shall I order them?

791
00:47:48,171 --> 00:47:50,630
At home, do you order food from
outside everyday?

792
00:47:51,713 --> 00:47:55,005
If we order everything from outside
how will it fit in our budget?

793
00:47:56,046 --> 00:47:57,713
Here, follow this.

794
00:47:58,755 --> 00:48:03,213
To study Mars we need infrared cameras,
ultra-violet cameras, sensors, everything!

795
00:48:03,421 --> 00:48:05,755
You are only giving me
enough room for a lens

796
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,046
How will I fit everything in?

797
00:48:07,213 --> 00:48:10,963
A person who can fit a lot
of science into a small space is called...

798
00:48:11,546 --> 00:48:13,338
a space scientist!

799
00:48:13,713 --> 00:48:15,213
Think, innovate!

800
00:48:15,671 --> 00:48:17,005
Yes, I've had the medicine

801
00:48:17,588 --> 00:48:18,880
I'll be back by 5.

802
00:48:18,963 --> 00:48:20,171
Yes, tell me.

803
00:48:21,713 --> 00:48:22,713
Busy?

804
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:27,713
To fit in the PSLV, if we have make
the satellite lightweight...

805
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:30,380
we will have to
reduce its size...

806
00:48:31,046 --> 00:48:35,171
How will we fit cameras, sensors,
transponders...?

807
00:48:36,421 --> 00:48:38,088
We need all the instruments, ma'am.

808
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:42,046
We are not going to Mars just
to circle around it...

809
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,296
We need to do a detailed
study of it!

810
00:48:45,796 --> 00:48:47,421
I know why we are going to Mars

811
00:48:47,546 --> 00:48:48,046
Thank you

812
00:48:49,546 --> 00:48:51,963
If everything could fit easily...

813
00:48:52,588 --> 00:48:54,338
why do we need
a Satellite designer?

814
00:48:55,088 --> 00:48:56,380
Don't think small.

815
00:48:56,796 --> 00:48:57,963
Make things small.

816
00:48:58,421 --> 00:48:59,255
Miniaturize!

817
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:03,338
We only have 8 billion
to make this mission happen

818
00:49:03,505 --> 00:49:05,421
so we need to start with basics.

819
00:49:05,671 --> 00:49:06,088
From the...

820
00:49:06,171 --> 00:49:08,880
Rakesh...Please stay seated!

821
00:49:09,171 --> 00:49:11,505
I've just spoken to the minister

822
00:49:11,671 --> 00:49:13,421
We may have to postpone this mission

823
00:49:13,625 --> 00:49:14,921
I'm sorry

824
00:49:15,588 --> 00:49:16,338
I don't understand...

825
00:49:16,421 --> 00:49:21,421
The government is very
happy with our Mars Mission

826
00:49:22,421 --> 00:49:24,505
But they aren't willing
to give us any extra money

827
00:49:25,005 --> 00:49:30,963
They don't have a problem if
we do this within ISRO's yearly budget

828
00:49:31,046 --> 00:49:33,796
How can I take out Rs. 8 billion...

829
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:37,088
from an on going project and give
it to the Mars Mission?

830
00:49:38,088 --> 00:49:41,296
Have we ever got an extra penny
for any of ISRO's missions?

831
00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:44,255
I am sorry.

832
00:49:44,368 --> 00:49:48,255
Sir, NASA's Maven has
a budget of Rs. 60 billion...

833
00:49:48,671 --> 00:49:50,713
we have only asked for Rs. 8 billion...

834
00:49:50,796 --> 00:49:52,713
Look at the difference sir,
there is no comparison!

835
00:49:53,088 --> 00:49:57,005
For 1.2 billion people it's
just a cost of a cup of tea.

836
00:49:57,380 --> 00:49:58,963
We have to do it for our country sir!

837
00:49:59,671 --> 00:50:01,546
Let's try it again!

838
00:50:01,755 --> 00:50:05,587
I understand... trust me,
I have tried my best.

839
00:50:06,255 --> 00:50:07,296
I'm sorry!

840
00:50:24,963 --> 00:50:26,255
Bad luck sir!

841
00:50:29,213 --> 00:50:31,046
I was actually very
excited for it, ma'am

842
00:50:32,088 --> 00:50:33,213
Sorry...

843
00:50:35,046 --> 00:50:37,880
If we were in NASA, budget would
have never been a problem

844
00:50:39,963 --> 00:50:40,838
Sir.

845
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:43,630
Sorry, sir.
Sorry, ma'am...

846
00:50:44,005 --> 00:50:45,963
It was a really
interesting project, sir

847
00:50:46,671 --> 00:50:47,671
Sorry...

848
00:50:50,546 --> 00:50:53,713
Both of you should get
your horoscopes checked

849
00:51:01,588 --> 00:51:04,088
In 1983 if Kapil Dev had been told

850
00:51:04,171 --> 00:51:06,963
"Sorry, there's no money
for flight tickets to London..."

851
00:51:08,421 --> 00:51:10,088
how would he have
won the world cup?

852
00:51:12,338 --> 00:51:13,171
I can't believe this!

853
00:51:22,171 --> 00:51:24,505
The new Sufiyaana. Sufi!

854
00:51:24,755 --> 00:51:26,546
Your son is playing in a Sufi group!

855
00:51:27,005 --> 00:51:29,963
Mom, it's Priya's birthday today.
I'll be late.

856
00:51:30,046 --> 00:51:30,796
What?

857
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:32,713
I'm thinking of resigning...

858
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:33,963
What?
Why?

859
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:34,963
Really?

860
00:51:35,338 --> 00:51:36,671
You were right, Sunil.

861
00:51:37,213 --> 00:51:39,213
Maybe I just got obsessed with my job.

862
00:51:40,963 --> 00:51:41,963
Shall we go to Ooty?

863
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:43,046
Ooty?

864
00:51:43,796 --> 00:51:45,796
Yes! Let's go.

865
00:51:45,963 --> 00:51:47,713
What are you all planning without me?

866
00:51:48,005 --> 00:51:49,005
Dad, we're going to Ooty!

867
00:51:49,088 --> 00:51:50,671
I'll have to think about it!

868
00:51:50,838 --> 00:51:52,088
From today you will listen...

869
00:51:52,296 --> 00:51:53,505
You and that idiot!

870
00:51:54,921 --> 00:51:57,130
Wonder if he is writing
from left to right or right to left!

871
00:51:57,713 --> 00:51:59,546
Dad, Urdu is the language of poets!

872
00:51:59,963 --> 00:52:01,546
- Mannerless!
- Ok guys! Dilip,

873
00:52:01,963 --> 00:52:03,130
we're all going to Ooty...

874
00:52:03,963 --> 00:52:06,088
- Ooty?
- Yes, Ooty!

875
00:52:06,630 --> 00:52:07,713
Mom, what about Mars?

876
00:52:08,671 --> 00:52:10,213
Your mother is quitting her job!

877
00:52:10,546 --> 00:52:12,255
What! Mom...

878
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:14,588
don't listen to this fellow!

879
00:52:14,796 --> 00:52:16,963
Don't leave your job! You'll die!

880
00:52:17,796 --> 00:52:20,671
If not Mars there's Mercury,
Jupiter, Pluto...

881
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:21,963
I'll give you some ideas.

882
00:52:22,546 --> 00:52:23,796
I know Space is your life!

883
00:52:23,963 --> 00:52:26,046
And anyway, I can't
come to Ooty and all...

884
00:52:26,130 --> 00:52:27,963
- Why?
- I have to finish my song.

885
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:29,505
Qawwali, huh?

886
00:52:29,921 --> 00:52:31,046
Pack your bloody bags!

887
00:52:31,588 --> 00:52:33,046
I'd like to thank you all...

888
00:52:33,130 --> 00:52:34,380
Sorry, to barge in sir

889
00:52:34,505 --> 00:52:36,046
Oh god, not him

890
00:52:36,130 --> 00:52:37,005
Rakesh!

891
00:52:37,671 --> 00:52:38,713
Sir, what is this?

892
00:52:39,171 --> 00:52:40,255
Can I just borrow this?

893
00:52:40,671 --> 00:52:41,338
Thank you

894
00:52:44,255 --> 00:52:48,921
China's first attempt at
going to Mars is unsuccessful.

895
00:52:48,963 --> 00:52:52,171
With the help of a rocket from Russia,

896
00:52:52,255 --> 00:52:53,963
China wanted to send
its satellite into space.

897
00:52:54,213 --> 00:52:56,630
But the Russian rocket
gave China a shock

898
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,213
and before it could cross
the Earth's orbit, it exploded.

899
00:52:59,296 --> 00:53:01,005
They could not cross the Van Allen belt!

900
00:53:01,421 --> 00:53:03,546
China wanted to be first
in Asia to go to Mars!

901
00:53:03,921 --> 00:53:06,880
The Chinese must have
used their "noodle science"

902
00:53:07,296 --> 00:53:09,171
as we have our "poori science"!

903
00:53:10,505 --> 00:53:11,338
Sir...

904
00:53:11,421 --> 00:53:13,296
China went to the moon before us

905
00:53:13,796 --> 00:53:15,796
But this is our chance
to reach Mars before them!

906
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:17,213
Let's not wait sir...

907
00:53:17,296 --> 00:53:18,380
But we don't have the budget!

908
00:53:18,505 --> 00:53:19,713
We have the budget sir!

909
00:53:20,796 --> 00:53:21,838
We have the budget.

910
00:53:24,588 --> 00:53:28,880
We were also going to use this same PHOBOS
Russian rocket for Chandrayan 2 mission

911
00:53:29,213 --> 00:53:31,171
and now we all know

912
00:53:31,630 --> 00:53:32,671
Phobos is a failure

913
00:53:33,046 --> 00:53:35,296
which means we will put our
Russian collaboration on hold!

914
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:38,130
Assume we stop Chandrayan 2 for now...

915
00:53:38,213 --> 00:53:41,755
Woah! We can't cancel
this program now!

916
00:53:42,505 --> 00:53:43,963
We're almost halfway there.

917
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:47,421
I suggest we talk to NASA,
let's bring NASA in.

918
00:53:47,546 --> 00:53:52,046
It may take at least 2 years for
a new collaboration with anybody else.

919
00:53:52,546 --> 00:53:56,921
So, Rakesh, assume
we postpone Chandrayaan 2

920
00:53:56,963 --> 00:54:01,755
but that mission has only
Rs. 4 billion remaining

921
00:54:01,963 --> 00:54:03,671
and you need Rs. 8 billion...

922
00:54:04,213 --> 00:54:06,630
Where will we get the money?
It's impossible.

923
00:54:08,671 --> 00:54:09,921
Can I use it again?

924
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,005
What is going on?

925
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:15,255
Did we have the money
to make our first rocket?

926
00:54:17,005 --> 00:54:18,046
We made it like this

927
00:54:19,255 --> 00:54:21,255
Do you know who these two are?

928
00:54:23,588 --> 00:54:25,963
This is Abdul Kalamji!
Our former president.

929
00:54:26,546 --> 00:54:28,588
And do you know who is next to him?

930
00:54:29,838 --> 00:54:31,088
It's not that impossible.

931
00:54:32,505 --> 00:54:34,296
There he is, our director!

932
00:54:35,338 --> 00:54:37,171
If we hadn't made the
rocket this way, that day...

933
00:54:37,296 --> 00:54:39,838
Because there was no money for a truck,
If they hadn't carried it piece by piece

934
00:54:39,963 --> 00:54:42,338
on cycles and bullock carts...

935
00:54:42,421 --> 00:54:46,213
assembled it in an old
church in Kerala...

936
00:54:46,296 --> 00:54:49,713
and lauched India's first rocket
successfully from a nearby field...

937
00:54:49,838 --> 00:54:51,755
would ISRO exist today?

938
00:54:52,338 --> 00:54:53,546
Would we be here?

939
00:54:54,796 --> 00:54:55,796
Impossible!

940
00:54:57,005 --> 00:55:00,713
Sir, I'm not sure how we will do it
but we will do it...

941
00:55:01,921 --> 00:55:02,755
We have to do it sir

942
00:55:03,963 --> 00:55:08,005
For me ISRO has not been Indian
Space Research Organisation...

943
00:55:08,088 --> 00:55:11,963
it has always been Impossible
Space Research Organisation!

944
00:55:12,255 --> 00:55:14,213
A dream that can be a reality!

945
00:55:14,505 --> 00:55:16,213
Oh my god!

946
00:55:17,338 --> 00:55:20,338
If only dreams and emotions
could propel us to another planet!

947
00:55:22,421 --> 00:55:25,630
Sir, we need to think
this through very carefully.

948
00:55:26,338 --> 00:55:28,588
Let's not rush in, or we will fail!

949
00:55:28,963 --> 00:55:30,630
What if we succeed?

950
00:55:32,213 --> 00:55:33,546
Sir, with all due respect,

951
00:55:34,588 --> 00:55:36,963
I have to tell you that
the way things stand right now

952
00:55:38,713 --> 00:55:42,671
the chances of this mission
succeeding are less than 1%

953
00:55:43,005 --> 00:55:44,421
Can anyone challenge that?

954
00:55:45,505 --> 00:55:46,546
I rest my case.

955
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:55,755
Hello, Kalam sir, how are you

956
00:55:55,963 --> 00:55:57,963
Me? Sir

957
00:55:58,338 --> 00:56:01,421
Some big Imported people are saying...

958
00:56:01,546 --> 00:56:05,546
The chances of the Mars Mission
succeeding are not even 1%

959
00:56:09,046 --> 00:56:12,963
Oh really, sir? Okay, sir...

960
00:56:13,130 --> 00:56:14,630
Sir, wait a minute for 5 minutes, sir.

961
00:56:14,838 --> 00:56:16,046
Yes, sir!

962
00:56:17,546 --> 00:56:21,546
Sir, Abdul Kalam sir - you know,
ex ISRO Chairman, ex Country Chairman

963
00:56:22,213 --> 00:56:23,296
He is challenging you

964
00:56:23,588 --> 00:56:27,921
He's saying "imported man, imported man"

965
00:56:28,546 --> 00:56:34,088
If there's even a 0.000001% chance
we can make it to Mars before China

966
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:37,880
shut your mouth and
let it happen

967
00:56:39,296 --> 00:56:40,255
Really, sir?

968
00:56:40,713 --> 00:56:42,963
That also I should say?

969
00:56:43,171 --> 00:56:47,796
He's also saying "Dream
is not what you see in sleep...

970
00:56:48,005 --> 00:56:51,046
Dream is something which
doesn't let you sleep!"

971
00:56:52,255 --> 00:56:53,880
Sir, I told him!

972
00:56:54,796 --> 00:56:57,505
Sir, will you talk to your old friend?

973
00:56:59,296 --> 00:57:01,505
I understand, sir.
You're busy!

974
00:57:01,755 --> 00:57:03,338
Thank you, sir!

975
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:07,838
What's so funny?
It's a very bad joke!

976
00:57:07,921 --> 00:57:13,338
Mr Rupert, every scientific achievement
was once considered a joke!

977
00:57:14,796 --> 00:57:19,213
If we tell the government that we are
postponing Chandrayaan 2...

978
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:24,921
and not spending the remaining
Rs. 4 billion this financial year...

979
00:57:24,963 --> 00:57:26,921
they will take the money back!

980
00:57:28,296 --> 00:57:29,255
- Rakesh
- Sir!

981
00:57:29,546 --> 00:57:31,338
We have a chance to create history

982
00:57:32,213 --> 00:57:35,755
If you can pull it off in Rs. 4 billion,
let's do it!

983
00:57:36,796 --> 00:57:37,755
Thank you, sir!

984
00:57:37,963 --> 00:57:40,588
Mr Padmanabhan,
Mr Anirudhh...

985
00:57:40,713 --> 00:57:45,921
Dr Kamath, I request you to come
forward and give this your time

986
00:57:45,963 --> 00:57:49,255
Sir! These are my best guys,
I can't spare them!

987
00:57:49,338 --> 00:57:50,963
- Calm down, parrot!
- What?

988
00:57:51,088 --> 00:57:52,630
Sorry, calm down Rupert

989
00:57:53,255 --> 00:57:57,005
That core team, those priceless
gems that you handpicked for me

990
00:57:57,421 --> 00:57:59,755
send them back to me

991
00:58:00,171 --> 00:58:01,088
All the best!

992
00:58:01,255 --> 00:58:03,088
Thank you very much!

993
00:58:34,270 --> 00:58:37,228
Message all you want now...
there's no network in Ooty!

994
00:58:38,353 --> 00:58:39,603
Family time!

995
00:58:42,687 --> 00:58:43,812
Hello

996
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:45,937
Yes sir?

997
00:58:47,562 --> 00:58:48,562
Okay...

998
00:58:49,770 --> 00:58:51,353
Really?

999
00:58:52,687 --> 00:58:54,645
Rs. 4 billion...How?

1000
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:04,145
I think we have to cancel Ooty...

1001
00:59:04,353 --> 00:59:05,145
What!

1002
00:59:05,312 --> 00:59:06,853
Yes! Inshallah!

1003
00:59:07,062 --> 00:59:08,187
Shut up!

1004
00:59:09,353 --> 00:59:12,395
Your IVF is successful.
Congratulations...

1005
00:59:12,478 --> 00:59:14,270
You're going to be a mother!

1006
00:59:16,978 --> 00:59:20,187
Call your mother. She will be
happier than us

1007
00:59:20,937 --> 00:59:22,687
Let's not tell her...

1008
00:59:22,853 --> 00:59:25,478
She'll think we did this
because of her

1009
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:26,978
Vivek, don't be silly

1010
00:59:27,395 --> 00:59:30,228
We made the decision because
the Mars Mission got cancelled!

1011
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:32,520
Else whatever her taunts...

1012
00:59:32,687 --> 00:59:34,645
We would never have
the time for a baby

1013
00:59:37,312 --> 00:59:38,353
Rakesh sir...

1014
00:59:42,978 --> 00:59:46,770
Ma'am, why are you endangering
so many lives on the road?

1015
00:59:47,353 --> 00:59:50,020
Bangalore commute is easy...

1016
00:59:50,187 --> 00:59:52,562
there are auto rickshaws,
the metro...

1017
00:59:52,728 --> 00:59:54,395
even the bus service has improved!

1018
00:59:54,687 --> 00:59:56,437
But the men haven't improved

1019
00:59:57,478 --> 00:59:59,353
I'm learning how to
drive for self defense

1020
00:59:59,437 --> 01:00:02,520
Learn Karate or Kung Fu instead

1021
01:00:05,353 --> 01:00:06,687
No phones while driving!

1022
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:11,353
Mrs Kritika Agarwal?

1023
01:00:11,687 --> 01:00:12,312
Hello?

1024
01:00:12,353 --> 01:00:13,395
Sorry to inform you...

1025
01:00:13,937 --> 01:00:16,603
Lieutenant Rishi Agarwal has been
injured in cross border firing

1026
01:00:18,562 --> 01:00:20,492
I am happy to inform you that
he is out of danger now...

1027
01:00:22,228 --> 01:00:23,437
Once his condition stabilizes...

1028
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,187
We will shift him to the Command
Hospital in Bangalore!

1029
01:00:48,103 --> 01:00:49,520
You're leaving us?

1030
01:00:49,585 --> 01:00:51,353
Excuse me? How dare you peep?

1031
01:00:51,728 --> 01:00:54,478
You've been after me since
that Mars mission. So cheap!

1032
01:00:55,853 --> 01:00:59,353
Sitting in ISRO and applying to join
NASA is not cheap?

1033
01:01:00,478 --> 01:01:01,812
Eka Gandhi!

1034
01:01:02,353 --> 01:01:05,020
Name is 'Gandhi' and you want to
Quit India?

1035
01:01:07,145 --> 01:01:09,395
Was your dad a cheap
dialogue writer?

1036
01:01:13,728 --> 01:01:14,645
Hello?

1037
01:01:16,978 --> 01:01:17,770
Hello?

1038
01:01:18,353 --> 01:01:20,228
Ok ma'am...Okay!

1039
01:01:24,228 --> 01:01:25,270
What!

1040
01:01:25,812 --> 01:01:28,353
Last week you said the
house was available

1041
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:30,727
What's the problem?

1042
01:01:31,103 --> 01:01:32,687
That I'm a divorcee or my surname?

1043
01:01:33,937 --> 01:01:37,853
He cheated on you, yet you're
the one house hunting...

1044
01:01:38,978 --> 01:01:41,520
You should have kicked
him out!

1045
01:01:41,853 --> 01:01:43,728
I could have...

1046
01:01:44,261 --> 01:01:45,458
The house would have been mine...

1047
01:01:45,848 --> 01:01:48,395
But if my husband cheated on me...

1048
01:01:48,478 --> 01:01:51,687
and then gave me a house
as payment...

1049
01:01:51,770 --> 01:01:54,353
What would I call myself?

1050
01:01:54,853 --> 01:01:55,978
Intelligent!

1051
01:01:56,937 --> 01:01:59,242
How long can you stay in a hostel?

1052
01:02:05,103 --> 01:02:07,270
Hello? Yes sir...

1053
01:02:15,562 --> 01:02:16,978
Hello?

1054
01:02:18,937 --> 01:02:21,062
Come!

1055
01:02:22,937 --> 01:02:23,937
Ok sir...

1056
01:02:24,687 --> 01:02:26,603
- I can't come.
- Why?

1057
01:02:27,437 --> 01:02:30,353
If I don't go they will cancel
my salary and pension

1058
01:02:30,437 --> 01:02:32,520
It's not like your son
sends us any money!

1059
01:02:32,728 --> 01:02:33,728
Rascal!

1060
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:34,812
Take this

1061
01:02:35,687 --> 01:02:37,270
Carefully...

1062
01:02:37,937 --> 01:02:40,187
Make sure you donate Rs.
101 at the temple!

1063
01:02:41,062 --> 01:02:42,353
This is our clock now

1064
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:44,603
We had 24 months...
We have wasted 4...

1065
01:02:44,645 --> 01:02:46,228
Now we have 20 months left
for launch

1066
01:02:46,395 --> 01:02:51,353
Since we last met, only one
thing has changed...

1067
01:02:51,728 --> 01:02:52,770
The budget!

1068
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:54,353
Have we got more funds?

1069
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:57,270
No, our funds have been halved!

1070
01:02:59,062 --> 01:03:02,187
Sir, let's order some strong
tea and brainstorm

1071
01:03:02,603 --> 01:03:05,395
The money for tea comes
from the budget!

1072
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:07,645
I suggest you cut down on your
tea drinking habits

1073
01:03:07,937 --> 01:03:10,770
What am I supposed to do?

1074
01:03:10,853 --> 01:03:13,054
Sir, you are a structural engineer...

1075
01:03:13,211 --> 01:03:15,937
You're responsible for making
the satellite material lighter

1076
01:03:16,353 --> 01:03:18,853
Lighter in weight and cost

1077
01:03:19,353 --> 01:03:19,728
Come on!

1078
01:03:28,395 --> 01:03:30,395
Believe it or not,
India is going to Mars!

1079
01:03:30,853 --> 01:03:32,937
Yes, GSLV is a failure

1080
01:03:33,645 --> 01:03:36,062
Yes, we don't have a rocket
that can take us to Mars

1081
01:03:36,770 --> 01:03:38,728
Nevertheless, we are going to Mars!

1082
01:03:44,132 --> 01:03:44,840
Hello?

1083
01:03:47,103 --> 01:03:49,270
I'm on my way...

1084
01:03:49,770 --> 01:03:50,978
I'm coming in a few minutes!

1085
01:03:51,395 --> 01:03:52,687
Kritika, where are you going?

1086
01:03:55,062 --> 01:03:56,645
One has flown...

1087
01:03:57,437 --> 01:03:58,645
One wicket down!

1088
01:04:06,728 --> 01:04:08,312
Everyone else is fine...

1089
01:04:28,687 --> 01:04:29,728
Thank you!

1090
01:04:32,770 --> 01:04:35,187
I asked for a dosa,
not paratha!

1091
01:04:35,437 --> 01:04:37,145
That is a dosa...

1092
01:04:37,353 --> 01:04:38,687
- It's so thick...
- Very bad, right?

1093
01:04:39,270 --> 01:04:41,032
Why?
Dosa is very good

1094
01:04:41,149 --> 01:04:42,687
But Delhi has the best
South Indian food!

1095
01:04:42,937 --> 01:04:43,562
True!

1096
01:04:43,687 --> 01:04:45,478
Dosa was born in South India!

1097
01:04:45,645 --> 01:04:47,312
What would you North Indians know?

1098
01:04:47,478 --> 01:04:48,687
You consider paper a dosa!

1099
01:04:48,770 --> 01:04:51,020
I won't argue with you...

1100
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:53,187
Dosas here, Pooris there...

1101
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:55,145
What are we doing?

1102
01:04:55,252 --> 01:04:57,187
How can such shortcuts
take us to Mars?

1103
01:04:57,395 --> 01:05:01,353
In one week both will lose
their enthusiasm...

1104
01:05:01,645 --> 01:05:04,312
The mission will shut down again...

1105
01:05:04,523 --> 01:05:06,523
And then, I will go on
my pilgrimage!

1106
01:05:08,228 --> 01:05:09,978
I'm going to talk to them

1107
01:05:11,353 --> 01:05:14,395
I can't believe this...

1108
01:05:14,562 --> 01:05:15,312
Good morning, everyone

1109
01:05:15,562 --> 01:05:16,478
Good morning, sir

1110
01:05:16,728 --> 01:05:19,103
Tara, what should we name the mission?

1111
01:05:20,048 --> 01:05:21,145
Sir we have an issue.

1112
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:22,853
Varsha is pregnant...

1113
01:05:23,645 --> 01:05:24,562
We need a replacement

1114
01:05:25,062 --> 01:05:25,770
Why?

1115
01:05:26,645 --> 01:05:29,562
Congratulations on becoming
a mom while going to Mars!

1116
01:05:30,770 --> 01:05:31,937
Hey, hey, hey...

1117
01:05:33,066 --> 01:05:33,983
MOM!

1118
01:05:34,353 --> 01:05:36,312
Mars Orbiter Mission

1119
01:05:37,062 --> 01:05:39,103
Fantastic name! Thank you Varsha!

1120
01:05:40,728 --> 01:05:43,853
But sir, she will be on 6 month
maternity leave...

1121
01:05:44,395 --> 01:05:45,645
Why can't she work?

1122
01:05:46,395 --> 01:05:47,770
If a scientist is pregnant,

1123
01:05:47,853 --> 01:05:50,937
and has the opportunity to lead the
country's most important mission...

1124
01:05:51,461 --> 01:05:52,562
Who are we to stop her?

1125
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:54,687
Of course...

1126
01:05:54,812 --> 01:05:57,603
If she wants to give it all up...

1127
01:05:57,728 --> 01:06:00,353
to stay home, it's her choice.

1128
01:06:01,770 --> 01:06:05,395
We can arrange everything
for the baby here...

1129
01:06:06,156 --> 01:06:08,270
We can organize a creche...

1130
01:06:08,687 --> 01:06:11,853
Tara, let her decide if she
wants to be a mom...

1131
01:06:12,228 --> 01:06:13,187
or a MOM Mom!

1132
01:06:13,478 --> 01:06:14,437
Sir...

1133
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:16,853
Can I take half a day off?

1134
01:06:18,211 --> 01:06:19,395
Please take a seat...

1135
01:06:21,712 --> 01:06:23,228
Sir, I want to work with you...

1136
01:06:23,687 --> 01:06:25,103
I don't want to be a part
of this Mars Mission

1137
01:06:26,353 --> 01:06:28,187
Sure,sure, I understand...

1138
01:06:28,687 --> 01:06:30,353
We'll get you out of that bread project!

1139
01:06:31,478 --> 01:06:34,645
But be there for some time,
we'll work something out

1140
01:06:35,187 --> 01:06:36,562
Thank you sir!

1141
01:06:39,728 --> 01:06:40,645
Wow!

1142
01:06:40,812 --> 01:06:42,437
Such determination
to get to NASA!

1143
01:06:43,145 --> 01:06:45,145
Buttering up the right man.

1144
01:06:45,562 --> 01:06:47,062
He has a lot of influence there...

1145
01:06:48,062 --> 01:06:50,645
Don't you have better things
to do Parmeshwar?

1146
01:06:50,812 --> 01:06:52,103
No...I mean, yes!

1147
01:06:54,937 --> 01:06:56,353
Any information on Kritika?

1148
01:06:56,770 --> 01:06:58,520
She hasn't answered my calls

1149
01:07:01,687 --> 01:07:02,587
Where are you going, sir?

1150
01:07:02,641 --> 01:07:04,437
We've worked 2 hours overtime, ma'am

1151
01:07:04,978 --> 01:07:06,103
Let's continue tomorrow

1152
01:07:07,274 --> 01:07:09,437
The hostel closes early...

1153
01:07:13,645 --> 01:07:15,478
A friend from the US is waiting
at home, ma'am

1154
01:07:15,687 --> 01:07:16,603
see you tomorrow

1155
01:07:18,312 --> 01:07:20,562
I have to attend a prayer,
Priest is waiting...

1156
01:07:20,937 --> 01:07:22,937
I'll do the rest tomorrow!

1157
01:07:23,853 --> 01:07:25,270
Ma'am, can I leave too?

1158
01:07:26,016 --> 01:07:27,228
I can stay if there's work...

1159
01:07:27,860 --> 01:07:28,603
Carry on...

1160
01:07:36,244 --> 01:07:39,437
With these people, the mission
will be very difficult...

1161
01:07:40,103 --> 01:07:42,020
Tara, they are all excellent scientists

1162
01:07:43,376 --> 01:07:44,812
The problem is...

1163
01:07:45,603 --> 01:07:49,562
The Mars Mission is
a dream for you...

1164
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:52,395
But for them...Just a job!

1165
01:07:52,798 --> 01:07:54,395
A 9 to 5 job!

1166
01:07:56,478 --> 01:08:01,020
We need to change their attitude...

1167
01:08:06,270 --> 01:08:08,603
I'm off to Ahmedabad and Trivandrum

1168
01:08:09,353 --> 01:08:10,853
Meeting on PSVL and Payloads

1169
01:08:11,395 --> 01:08:12,437
I'll be back in a week

1170
01:08:13,103 --> 01:08:14,562
Goodnight.

1171
01:08:30,821 --> 01:08:32,696
Can't sleep?

1172
01:08:33,429 --> 01:08:34,720
Anya and Dilip are asleep?

1173
01:08:36,812 --> 01:08:40,103
Don't look at me like that,
I know it's 11:30...

1174
01:08:40,395 --> 01:08:41,937
Your daughter isn't home yet

1175
01:08:42,478 --> 01:08:43,520
She isn't even answering the phone!

1176
01:08:44,187 --> 01:08:44,978
But you...

1177
01:08:45,187 --> 01:08:46,603
Focus on your work!

1178
01:08:47,395 --> 01:08:49,395
These everyday problems
don't concern you, right?

1179
01:08:50,649 --> 01:08:51,853
Why didn't you call me...

1180
01:08:51,878 --> 01:08:53,395
How would that help?

1181
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:03,770
Hello?

1182
01:09:04,020 --> 01:09:04,812
Priya?

1183
01:09:05,687 --> 01:09:06,978
Is Anya with you?

1184
01:09:08,437 --> 01:09:09,353
Oh...

1185
01:09:09,937 --> 01:09:10,853
You didn't go?

1186
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:14,108
Where?

1187
01:09:16,645 --> 01:09:18,270
Okay, thank you!

1188
01:09:20,016 --> 01:09:21,520
Get dressed, Sunil

1189
01:09:22,098 --> 01:09:22,973
Why?

1190
01:09:23,770 --> 01:09:25,478
Get dressed, Sunil.

1191
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:57,353
Wait Sunil!

1192
01:09:57,478 --> 01:09:58,478
Come here

1193
01:09:58,645 --> 01:10:00,603
- But Anya's right there!
- Just let her be!

1194
01:10:01,353 --> 01:10:02,270
2 beers, please!

1195
01:10:05,937 --> 01:10:06,603
Thank you

1196
01:10:06,770 --> 01:10:07,687
Here you go!

1197
01:10:14,687 --> 01:10:15,978
Cheers

1198
01:10:18,228 --> 01:10:20,645
If you're so worried
about your daughter...

1199
01:10:20,937 --> 01:10:24,353
First save her friends'
phone numbers

1200
01:10:26,603 --> 01:10:28,395
I love my work!

1201
01:10:28,437 --> 01:10:32,437
Don't try to make me feel
guilty, please!

1202
01:10:34,437 --> 01:10:36,187
I know my daughter, Sunil!

1203
01:10:42,270 --> 01:10:43,770
Anya, shots!

1204
01:10:44,103 --> 01:10:45,770
- No I don't drink...
- Hi girls!

1205
01:10:45,978 --> 01:10:47,978
Mom? We were just leaving...

1206
01:10:48,312 --> 01:10:49,478
- Why? So early?
- Sorry.

1207
01:10:49,812 --> 01:10:50,687
What shots are we having?

1208
01:10:50,853 --> 01:10:52,937
This is a jagerbomb...

1209
01:10:53,020 --> 01:10:55,145
- Ya? Ya!
- Jagerbomb...

1210
01:10:55,603 --> 01:10:58,437
Sunil!

1211
01:11:03,353 --> 01:11:04,978
Yucks! How do you have this shit, man?

1212
01:11:05,062 --> 01:11:06,937
Ok come let's dance!

1213
01:11:06,978 --> 01:11:08,020
Dance?

1214
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:15,978
Tara please, I'm not coming!

1215
01:11:16,145 --> 01:11:17,728
Come, Sunil!

1216
01:11:24,228 --> 01:11:25,853
Sunil, don't be a bore!

1217
01:11:27,169 --> 01:11:29,185
Yeah dad don't be a bore!

1218
01:11:30,812 --> 01:11:31,978
I'm a bore?

1219
01:12:18,603 --> 01:12:20,312
Oh my god, dad!

1220
01:12:20,395 --> 01:12:21,728
You killed it today!

1221
01:12:21,812 --> 01:12:23,770
It's been so many years since I danced

1222
01:12:24,352 --> 01:12:26,103
Those were the days...

1223
01:12:27,266 --> 01:12:28,770
Don't laugh!

1224
01:12:28,812 --> 01:12:31,520
When I was young I dreamt
of being a dancer!

1225
01:12:31,728 --> 01:12:33,020
Then what happened?

1226
01:12:34,145 --> 01:12:35,270
I grew up!

1227
01:12:35,645 --> 01:12:37,145
All my dreams flew away

1228
01:12:37,437 --> 01:12:39,023
Life changed my moves!

1229
01:12:39,101 --> 01:12:40,978
Laugh all you want, you're still young

1230
01:12:41,250 --> 01:12:43,145
Once you're my age...

1231
01:12:43,478 --> 01:12:46,562
you too will say
"those were the days..."

1232
01:12:49,110 --> 01:12:50,319
<i>Dreams...</i>

1233
01:12:59,187 --> 01:13:00,603
Oh, wow!

1234
01:13:01,228 --> 01:13:02,687
Is it your birthday, ma'am?

1235
01:13:02,853 --> 01:13:03,562
No

1236
01:13:03,687 --> 01:13:04,770
Then whose birthday is it?

1237
01:13:04,853 --> 01:13:06,020
All of ours.

1238
01:13:06,602 --> 01:13:08,937
Happy birthday to the
scientist in all of us!

1239
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:12,603
Do you remember when you decided
to become a scientist?

1240
01:13:13,197 --> 01:13:14,395
I remember when I did

1241
01:13:14,853 --> 01:13:18,728
When I was a kid, I went to watch
Star Wars with my dad...

1242
01:13:19,145 --> 01:13:20,395
I was so fascinated!

1243
01:13:20,687 --> 01:13:23,603
As soon as I stepped out I knew
what I was going to be...

1244
01:13:24,540 --> 01:13:26,187
That day I was born again...

1245
01:13:26,353 --> 01:13:27,520
As a space scientist!

1246
01:13:27,812 --> 01:13:30,812
I am sure you all have similar stories...

1247
01:13:32,688 --> 01:13:36,126
When was the scientist in you born?

1248
01:15:25,794 --> 01:15:28,478
We all have dreams when we are children...

1249
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:32,020
But how many of us get to
live those dreams?

1250
01:15:33,610 --> 01:15:34,853
We are so lucky!

1251
01:15:35,212 --> 01:15:37,270
We dreamt of science
and became scientists!

1252
01:15:38,395 --> 01:15:41,062
And then forgot why we became
scientists in the first place!

1253
01:15:42,978 --> 01:15:44,062
Life happens...

1254
01:15:45,603 --> 01:15:46,853
Our everyday problems...

1255
01:15:47,119 --> 01:15:51,020
...tend to outweigh our
desire to reach for the stars

1256
01:15:51,375 --> 01:15:54,062
Our dreams become 9 to 5 jobs...

1257
01:15:54,478 --> 01:15:55,562
That's life!

1258
01:15:55,843 --> 01:15:59,187
But today, we have a choice

1259
01:16:00,353 --> 01:16:04,228
We can either look back at our childhood
and think, 'Those were the days'

1260
01:16:04,994 --> 01:16:08,020
Or we can remember those
moments and say...

1261
01:16:09,251 --> 01:16:11,520
'I am going to live my dream!'

1262
01:16:12,728 --> 01:16:14,353
The power of a scientist...

1263
01:16:14,395 --> 01:16:17,395
Is that they can change their nation's
future with their science!

1264
01:16:17,437 --> 01:16:19,020
And today we have that chance!

1265
01:16:19,187 --> 01:16:23,312
If we don't embrace our dreams today

1266
01:16:23,395 --> 01:16:25,853
no child will dream of being
a scientist tomorrow!

1267
01:16:28,313 --> 01:16:29,562
I said a lot...

1268
01:16:32,395 --> 01:16:35,645
It's not everyday that we get
the chance to go to Mars...

1269
01:16:42,728 --> 01:16:45,437
Ma'am, this mission won't happen...

1270
01:16:47,541 --> 01:16:50,270
until it becomes an obsession!

1271
01:16:55,103 --> 01:16:56,645
I'll let my wife know

1272
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:01,395
Tomorrow onwards...2 portions of curd rice

1273
01:17:03,173 --> 01:17:04,395
Double shift!

1274
01:17:07,395 --> 01:17:10,020
Ma'am ISRO has an ambulance, right?

1275
01:17:14,132 --> 01:17:17,145
The hostel gate shuts at 8...

1276
01:17:18,645 --> 01:17:19,770
I really don't know...

1277
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:21,478
You can stay with me!

1278
01:17:21,821 --> 01:17:23,395
I just broke up with my boyfriend

1279
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:24,437
Boyfriend?

1280
01:17:24,728 --> 01:17:25,853
Yeah, so?

1281
01:17:26,645 --> 01:17:29,270
Eka, don't lose your freedom!

1282
01:17:30,228 --> 01:17:31,395
Meet more men!

1283
01:17:33,812 --> 01:17:35,603
Neha, stay with us...

1284
01:17:36,103 --> 01:17:37,562
My son's room is empty

1285
01:17:38,145 --> 01:17:41,562
But you'll only get vegetarian food!

1286
01:17:45,062 --> 01:17:47,395
Happy birthday to the
scientist in all of us!

1287
01:17:52,838 --> 01:17:54,020
Where's Kritika?

1288
01:17:54,772 --> 01:17:56,564
Hello sir! How are you feeling?

1289
01:17:57,147 --> 01:17:57,730
Good

1290
01:17:58,022 --> 01:17:58,980
Wait, I'll do it

1291
01:18:01,897 --> 01:18:02,772
Take this

1292
01:18:04,105 --> 01:18:05,480
Please take this, thank you.

1293
01:18:05,564 --> 01:18:07,605
Please take this, thank you.

1294
01:18:08,439 --> 01:18:09,480
You left the Mars Mission?

1295
01:18:10,772 --> 01:18:11,480
Why?

1296
01:18:12,564 --> 01:18:15,605
That's not important right now.
First you recover. Eat!

1297
01:18:19,897 --> 01:18:21,480
Not important?

1298
01:18:23,022 --> 01:18:25,147
You were so happy when you
got selected for this mission

1299
01:18:25,855 --> 01:18:29,064
In this condition I'll be a
weakness for them

1300
01:18:35,355 --> 01:18:36,855
You wanted to be a Space Scientist...

1301
01:18:37,314 --> 01:18:39,564
So I had to wait five years
to marry you...

1302
01:18:40,897 --> 01:18:42,105
Why are you working as a nurse now?

1303
01:18:43,022 --> 01:18:44,480
Because I married you!

1304
01:18:51,147 --> 01:18:53,897
But if you were hospitalized...

1305
01:18:54,647 --> 01:18:56,480
I wouldn't leave the
battlefield for you

1306
01:18:57,147 --> 01:18:58,147
That's different

1307
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:01,064
That is your duty to your country

1308
01:19:04,980 --> 01:19:07,480
Is your mission any lesser
than an army mission?

1309
01:19:08,980 --> 01:19:10,730
It's equally important for the country

1310
01:19:12,772 --> 01:19:13,939
This is your duty!

1311
01:19:18,772 --> 01:19:20,314
- Good morning, ma'am!
- Good morning

1312
01:19:20,439 --> 01:19:22,230
Ma'am, can I say something?

1313
01:19:22,610 --> 01:19:24,438
You brought the scientists
back to life...

1314
01:19:24,897 --> 01:19:26,647
Can we add some life to
the Mars Room too?

1315
01:20:55,064 --> 01:20:59,897
Ban plastic! Save the ocean!

1316
01:21:13,548 --> 01:21:15,680
You want to make the satellite
out of waste plastic?

1317
01:21:15,730 --> 01:21:18,605
Sir, for the world this
plastic is pollution...

1318
01:21:19,647 --> 01:21:21,939
But for us it's a solution!

1319
01:21:22,022 --> 01:21:27,230
Mr Iyengar, space maximum temperature
range is -150 degrees celsius cold

1320
01:21:27,355 --> 01:21:28,522
Or 100 degrees heat...

1321
01:21:28,605 --> 01:21:30,939
It's been in the ocean for 100 years...

1322
01:21:31,272 --> 01:21:35,022
It has endured extreme cold,
heat, pressure...

1323
01:21:35,355 --> 01:21:39,480
Even iron rusts in the ocean...

1324
01:21:40,105 --> 01:21:42,980
But plastic remains the same!

1325
01:21:43,407 --> 01:21:46,897
Sir, if we reinforce the composite
fibre of this and aluminium...

1326
01:21:47,105 --> 01:21:48,897
it will be lighter and stronger!

1327
01:21:49,022 --> 01:21:49,897
Yes!

1328
01:21:51,105 --> 01:21:51,980
The lightest...

1329
01:21:52,564 --> 01:21:54,939
handling extreme conditions in space!

1330
01:21:57,361 --> 01:21:58,022
Test it.

1331
01:22:06,897 --> 01:22:07,897
Fantastic!

1332
01:22:09,314 --> 01:22:12,605
The material cost
and weight has halved...

1333
01:22:12,772 --> 01:22:13,939
So why are you so sad?

1334
01:22:14,147 --> 01:22:15,772
Now can I get a full cup of tea?

1335
01:22:24,605 --> 01:22:28,564
Eka, your trajectory
path is incomplete

1336
01:22:28,994 --> 01:22:31,439
Sir, I've tried everything!

1337
01:22:32,147 --> 01:22:35,772
This trajectory with 850 kgs fuel...
It's impossible!

1338
01:22:37,564 --> 01:22:39,564
The fuel will run out before
the Mars injection

1339
01:22:40,022 --> 01:22:41,314
We'll only reach till here!

1340
01:22:41,939 --> 01:22:44,355
Impossible? Did you say 'Impossible?'

1341
01:22:44,814 --> 01:22:46,147
Did you say 'impossible'?

1342
01:22:47,897 --> 01:22:48,897
You know something?

1343
01:22:49,605 --> 01:22:50,772
You're working at the wrong place

1344
01:22:51,980 --> 01:22:53,980
Just pack your bags, and out!

1345
01:22:55,105 --> 01:22:56,355
Get out of here!

1346
01:22:57,314 --> 01:22:58,230
Useless!

1347
01:23:24,689 --> 01:23:26,355
I'm working at the wrong place.

1348
01:23:26,939 --> 01:23:30,855
I know that! 850 kgs fuel!

1349
01:23:32,230 --> 01:23:34,272
Yes! It's impossible.

1350
01:23:35,980 --> 01:23:39,477
Impossible...

1351
01:24:01,105 --> 01:24:01,897
I got it, sir!

1352
01:24:02,438 --> 01:24:04,814
We'll have to change the
satellite design slightly

1353
01:24:04,977 --> 01:24:08,272
If we position the solar panel
and the antenna this way

1354
01:24:08,522 --> 01:24:09,939
just like a ship's sail

1355
01:24:10,230 --> 01:24:11,189
It's so simple!

1356
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:14,480
The satellite can move ahead using
the solar radiation pressure

1357
01:24:14,564 --> 01:24:17,647
the same way a ship uses
wind pressure to sail.

1358
01:24:17,712 --> 01:24:18,480
Without fuel!

1359
01:24:18,564 --> 01:24:21,689
This way we can keep the satellite
running without using any extra fuel!

1360
01:24:23,355 --> 01:24:24,480
There's one problem, sir

1361
01:24:24,897 --> 01:24:27,272
Adding the antenna makes
the satellite wider

1362
01:24:27,647 --> 01:24:29,897
How will it fit into the PSLV?

1363
01:24:30,022 --> 01:24:32,855
Fitting large things into small
spaces is my area of expertise

1364
01:24:33,105 --> 01:24:34,522
Don't worry, I'll solve this!

1365
01:24:35,022 --> 01:24:36,730
Well done. Congratulations!

1366
01:24:36,980 --> 01:24:38,897
Sir, he's watching you

1367
01:24:39,522 --> 01:24:40,897
- Sorry!
- Great job, Eka!

1368
01:24:40,980 --> 01:24:41,564
Thanks!

1369
01:24:41,897 --> 01:24:42,772
Brilliant idea

1370
01:24:43,022 --> 01:24:44,689
A little fire at the right moment...

1371
01:24:44,772 --> 01:24:47,064
and even the brain works
at a higher orbit!

1372
01:24:48,564 --> 01:24:49,272
Hey!

1373
01:24:50,522 --> 01:24:52,647
I've been trying to call you!

1374
01:24:53,189 --> 01:24:54,897
There's an opening, you can
rejoin my department

1375
01:24:54,980 --> 01:24:56,314
Sir, about that...

1376
01:24:57,314 --> 01:24:59,855
Thank you, but I'd like to stay
with the Mars Mission

1377
01:25:01,266 --> 01:25:03,105
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

1378
01:25:16,897 --> 01:25:17,897
Any progress?

1379
01:25:18,189 --> 01:25:19,355
Not really, ma'am...

1380
01:25:19,564 --> 01:25:20,522
The review committee
is coming

1381
01:25:20,855 --> 01:25:22,814
If the camera isn't ready,
what will we show them?

1382
01:25:23,439 --> 01:25:27,147
Parmeshwar you have to think
out of the box! We don't have time!

1383
01:25:30,439 --> 01:25:32,897
Parmeshwar! Take a break.

1384
01:25:33,689 --> 01:25:36,314
Let's get some fresh air. Come!

1385
01:25:44,272 --> 01:25:45,897
You're a virgin, right?

1386
01:25:47,689 --> 01:25:48,730
Meaning?

1387
01:25:48,980 --> 01:25:49,855
Meaning of "virgin"?

1388
01:25:49,980 --> 01:25:52,564
No! I mean, why?

1389
01:25:52,855 --> 01:25:55,022
Why what? It's clear.

1390
01:25:55,980 --> 01:25:59,022
You just need sex... Don't mistake it for
love's gravitational force!

1391
01:25:59,105 --> 01:26:03,314
No. I'll have sex only after marriage!

1392
01:26:05,314 --> 01:26:06,314
Seriously!

1393
01:26:09,064 --> 01:26:10,522
Who's going to marry you?

1394
01:26:11,055 --> 01:26:14,897
You need experience for that.
Marriage is not a Mars Mission.

1395
01:26:22,189 --> 01:26:26,564
Does your family believe in astrology?

1396
01:26:27,939 --> 01:26:28,897
Astrology?

1397
01:26:32,939 --> 01:26:34,022
Fool!

1398
01:26:35,105 --> 01:26:36,897
I don't even know who my parents are

1399
01:26:38,605 --> 01:26:40,439
Or where and when I was born...

1400
01:26:43,522 --> 01:26:45,189
But your surname, Gandhi?

1401
01:26:46,230 --> 01:26:51,064
All the kids in my orphanage
had the surname Gandhi!

1402
01:26:51,230 --> 01:26:51,897
Why's that?

1403
01:26:51,980 --> 01:26:54,730
He's the Father of the nation, isn't he?

1404
01:26:58,022 --> 01:27:00,897
To fit the antenna, the material
should be flexible

1405
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:03,647
Change the umbrella's design

1406
01:27:04,189 --> 01:27:05,439
You change the material

1407
01:27:05,522 --> 01:27:07,980
Change to cloth! It's lighter too

1408
01:27:08,314 --> 01:27:09,647
You're mad?

1409
01:27:09,897 --> 01:27:12,939
It's an antenna. How will
cloth send the signal?

1410
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:15,355
It will sir, just like metal!

1411
01:27:15,772 --> 01:27:17,897
Come, I'll show you

1412
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:24,605
A small asteroid stone will be
enough to tear the cloth!

1413
01:27:25,272 --> 01:27:27,814
Sir, this wolverine material

1414
01:27:27,897 --> 01:27:31,980
Once torn, it can repair itself.
See!

1415
01:27:32,439 --> 01:27:34,730
It's a good solution,
but an expensive one...

1416
01:27:37,466 --> 01:27:38,466
Good job!

1417
01:27:39,480 --> 01:27:40,564
Thank you, sir

1418
01:27:50,022 --> 01:27:52,897
Who's that? Your husband?

1419
01:27:55,980 --> 01:27:56,939
Yes, sir

1420
01:27:57,689 --> 01:28:02,355
You can make a satellite intelligent
enough to repair itself...

1421
01:28:02,855 --> 01:28:06,897
you don't have the intelligence
to repair your life?

1422
01:28:07,730 --> 01:28:10,814
Oh no! Bloody fellow...Get off!

1423
01:28:10,980 --> 01:28:13,189
- What happened, sir?
- Quick, get off!

1424
01:28:13,571 --> 01:28:15,272
- But what happened?
- Go stand there

1425
01:28:20,439 --> 01:28:23,314
He knocked me over!

1426
01:28:24,605 --> 01:28:25,939
It wasn't my fault...

1427
01:28:30,605 --> 01:28:31,980
I'm okay! Get on, quick!

1428
01:28:33,897 --> 01:28:35,022
Bash him

1429
01:28:35,814 --> 01:28:36,939
Is the heart repaired?

1430
01:28:37,439 --> 01:28:40,689
If he had been bashed up more
your heart would have felt even better...

1431
01:28:41,105 --> 01:28:42,355
Sir, you're completely mad!

1432
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:44,105
The Finance Report has arrived

1433
01:28:44,272 --> 01:28:47,230
You're Rs. 700 to 800
million over budget

1434
01:28:47,814 --> 01:28:51,064
Look at the Ahmedabad cost
for transponders, sensors...

1435
01:28:51,897 --> 01:28:54,814
Where will we get the money
to manufacture everything?

1436
01:28:55,147 --> 01:28:59,730
The Rs. 4 billion budget from
Chandrayan 2 is almost over

1437
01:29:01,147 --> 01:29:02,814
Rework your priorities

1438
01:29:05,187 --> 01:29:06,647
Sir, I was saying...

1439
01:29:06,730 --> 01:29:07,772
Sir, sir, sir!

1440
01:29:10,105 --> 01:29:11,439
If we talk to the government...

1441
01:29:11,772 --> 01:29:14,147
Sir, one minute, please!

1442
01:29:14,855 --> 01:29:16,480
Go ahead...sorry sir.

1443
01:29:16,564 --> 01:29:20,730
I agree, there's no money left
from Chandrayan 2 budget...

1444
01:29:20,939 --> 01:29:24,272
But doesn't Chandrayan 2 already have
all the things we need the money for?

1445
01:29:24,899 --> 01:29:26,064
What do you mean?

1446
01:29:26,439 --> 01:29:28,272
Sir, what are we ordering
from Ahmedabad?

1447
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:30,647
Sensors, transponders,
all the instruments?

1448
01:29:30,897 --> 01:29:32,980
But everything is already
available in Chandrayan 2!

1449
01:29:33,314 --> 01:29:36,439
The project has stopped indefinitely

1450
01:29:36,814 --> 01:29:39,522
So why don't we ask for everything
we need from Chandrayan 2?

1451
01:29:39,939 --> 01:29:41,022
Why waste?

1452
01:29:45,897 --> 01:29:46,980
Women, sir...

1453
01:29:47,105 --> 01:29:49,980
Take last night's leftover dinner,
throw in some spices

1454
01:29:50,064 --> 01:29:51,939
and serve it the next
day for breakfast!

1455
01:29:53,605 --> 01:29:54,480
Why waste!

1456
01:29:54,897 --> 01:29:58,689
Is there no difference between Home Science
and Rocket Science for you people?

1457
01:29:58,855 --> 01:30:00,355
It's all the same, sir.

1458
01:30:00,711 --> 01:30:02,230
What are you doing, sir!

1459
01:30:25,689 --> 01:30:27,230
The colour camera's going over weight

1460
01:30:27,522 --> 01:30:30,022
The satellite will be in Eclipse
Mode for 24 minutes

1461
01:30:30,897 --> 01:30:33,522
One battery lasts 40 minutes, right?

1462
01:30:34,230 --> 01:30:35,022
So, why use two?

1463
01:30:35,272 --> 01:30:37,730
For safety. Two's better than one.

1464
01:30:37,814 --> 01:30:38,772
Then why not 5?

1465
01:30:39,439 --> 01:30:42,730
Bring the whole generator in for safety!
Shift to 1 battery.

1466
01:30:43,022 --> 01:30:44,439
The weight will automatically reduce

1467
01:30:45,855 --> 01:30:49,064
Camera is now ready for installation.
Satellite is ready for production!

1468
01:31:32,022 --> 01:31:35,689
MOM is a good name. But let's
find a name with more weight!

1469
01:31:37,064 --> 01:31:41,272
All this time we've been
trying to reduce weight...

1470
01:31:41,355 --> 01:31:44,522
But if you say so...
You tell us, sir!

1471
01:31:44,605 --> 01:31:45,314
Mangalyaan?

1472
01:32:26,439 --> 01:32:27,480
Shit!

1473
01:32:29,230 --> 01:32:30,647
Must have hanged...

1474
01:32:31,730 --> 01:32:32,647
What are you doing?

1475
01:32:33,564 --> 01:32:36,647
Switch off-on always
works in hang mode

1476
01:32:38,314 --> 01:32:40,480
See! Switch off.

1477
01:32:41,022 --> 01:32:43,022
Go to sleep. Or else you'll collapse!

1478
01:32:43,105 --> 01:32:45,064
We've sent 2 INA ships
to the Pacific Ocean

1479
01:32:45,147 --> 01:32:46,272
They haven't even reached
their positions yet!

1480
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:48,105
The rocket is launching from India...

1481
01:32:48,564 --> 01:32:50,272
Why are you sending ships
to the Pacific Ocean?

1482
01:32:50,647 --> 01:32:52,355
Our technique is a little different...

1483
01:32:53,439 --> 01:32:55,647
When the Satellite rotates
around the earth...

1484
01:32:55,730 --> 01:32:58,939
We'll have to monitor it
through various countries

1485
01:32:59,814 --> 01:33:03,897
But there's a huge gap between Australia and
America which is the Pacific Ocean

1486
01:33:04,022 --> 01:33:07,647
So we are sending ships there,
with mobile tracking centres

1487
01:33:08,064 --> 01:33:09,147
And they haven't reached yet.

1488
01:33:09,439 --> 01:33:11,772
It's the Indian Navy. They'll reach.

1489
01:33:12,110 --> 01:33:13,064
Now go to sleep.

1490
01:33:15,147 --> 01:33:17,564
There's a storm in the
Bay of Bengal...

1491
01:33:36,439 --> 01:33:37,939
Such bad weather, all across!

1492
01:33:38,147 --> 01:33:40,355
How can we launch with
thunder and lightning?

1493
01:33:40,647 --> 01:33:42,355
Weather forecast study...

1494
01:33:44,439 --> 01:33:45,522
Basic sense...

1495
01:33:46,355 --> 01:33:47,235
Abort it!

1496
01:33:47,855 --> 01:33:49,314
Wait 3 years, you can go later.

1497
01:33:50,522 --> 01:33:52,064
Don't you dare say abort.

1498
01:33:52,522 --> 01:33:54,355
Rakesh, relax

1499
01:33:54,689 --> 01:33:56,064
Tell him to relax, sir!

1500
01:33:56,980 --> 01:33:57,897
Tell him to shut up!

1501
01:33:57,939 --> 01:33:58,689
Rakesh!

1502
01:33:59,814 --> 01:34:00,897
Take it easy

1503
01:34:01,730 --> 01:34:03,105
You're teaching me about basic sense?

1504
01:34:04,897 --> 01:34:05,980
Weather forecast means

1505
01:34:06,064 --> 01:34:08,647
making an estimate, and nobody
in the world can be 100% sure.

1506
01:34:09,272 --> 01:34:11,272
Tsunamis don't warn you
a month in advance

1507
01:34:11,897 --> 01:34:13,855
So you, just shut your trap!

1508
01:34:14,105 --> 01:34:15,980
Hey! Do you know who you're talking to?

1509
01:34:16,064 --> 01:34:20,564
I'm talking to a man who doesn't
have the basic sense to know

1510
01:34:20,730 --> 01:34:23,891
that even a 2-bit scientist always
has a back up plan!

1511
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:25,939
Just look at these conditions,
you can't launch!

1512
01:34:26,064 --> 01:34:28,480
We have a 9 day buffer, sir!

1513
01:34:29,689 --> 01:34:32,230
Until 5th November,
we can launch anytime!

1514
01:34:32,772 --> 01:34:33,522
After which?

1515
01:34:33,897 --> 01:34:37,689
After which either he lives or I do.
Sorry, sir.

1516
01:34:39,522 --> 01:34:42,064
So for the time being, the
mission is on standby.

1517
01:34:43,269 --> 01:34:46,561
Why don't you guys just chill
out, and have a drink?

1518
01:34:46,743 --> 01:34:48,022
It's badly needed, right?

1519
01:34:49,930 --> 01:34:52,397
Suppose you're standing on Mars...

1520
01:34:53,105 --> 01:34:57,022
will you be heavier or lighter?

1521
01:34:57,673 --> 01:34:59,965
Right now my head is heavy,
so please be quiet.

1522
01:35:01,381 --> 01:35:03,943
<i>Storm in Pacific Ocean
and a cyclone in Bay of Bengal...</i>

1523
01:35:04,037 --> 01:35:06,256
Not this again. Someone switch it off

1524
01:35:06,340 --> 01:35:09,131
<i>India's Mars dreams are now put on hold,
indefinitely...</i>

1525
01:35:11,256 --> 01:35:15,381
Tara, looks like all our dreams
are definitely indefinite. Cheers!

1526
01:35:20,715 --> 01:35:23,840
You've all have had too much to
drink. Thank god for the metro!

1527
01:35:24,548 --> 01:35:25,548
This way, sir.

1528
01:35:31,892 --> 01:35:33,183
Are you blind?

1529
01:35:34,517 --> 01:35:36,767
He spilled my coffee!

1530
01:35:36,850 --> 01:35:37,725
Sorry...

1531
01:35:43,517 --> 01:35:46,767
<i>Storms have postponed the Mars Mission</i>

1532
01:35:51,100 --> 01:35:52,350
Have you lost it?

1533
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:55,433
- Don't hit me...
- Sit down!

1534
01:35:58,267 --> 01:35:58,975
Switch that off!

1535
01:35:59,058 --> 01:36:00,100
Look at this drunkard...

1536
01:36:00,642 --> 01:36:02,392
- Handle him, ma'am!
- Please!

1537
01:36:31,558 --> 01:36:32,600
He will die!

1538
01:36:38,975 --> 01:36:44,058
If I ever see you again
I will kill you!

1539
01:36:49,407 --> 01:36:52,642
Are you okay, sir? What happened?

1540
01:38:14,673 --> 01:38:17,548
Mom, I have always wondered...

1541
01:38:17,938 --> 01:38:21,589
in spite of being a scientist
why do you pray so much?

1542
01:38:22,506 --> 01:38:23,881
Because I believe in God!

1543
01:38:24,589 --> 01:38:26,548
There is a power beyond science

1544
01:38:27,985 --> 01:38:29,214
Time to change the God?

1545
01:38:31,548 --> 01:38:34,881
Changing a picture or a prayer
doesn't change the power

1546
01:38:37,256 --> 01:38:38,964
Pray to whatever God you want...

1547
01:38:39,589 --> 01:38:43,149
Just pray to the power,
not to the picture.

1548
01:38:55,798 --> 01:38:57,214
Tomorrow's the last day...

1549
01:38:58,798 --> 01:39:00,464
If we can't launch tomorrow...

1550
01:39:18,048 --> 01:39:23,631
Rakesh, is there any chance
we can launch after today?

1551
01:39:24,406 --> 01:39:27,198
Changing our trajectory,
increasing the speed...

1552
01:39:31,031 --> 01:39:32,073
Tara?

1553
01:39:33,489 --> 01:39:35,946
No, sir. We'll miss Mars.

1554
01:39:54,406 --> 01:39:55,323
Mission abort!

1555
01:39:57,448 --> 01:39:59,157
Mission abort!

1556
01:40:05,489 --> 01:40:06,364
Sorry Sir.

1557
01:41:15,906 --> 01:41:19,448
Tara! Weather is clearing! Come on,
everybody! Come on!

1558
01:41:27,170 --> 01:41:29,904
Mission reactivate!

1559
01:41:38,739 --> 01:41:40,489
Check Pacific Ocean ship status!

1560
01:41:40,823 --> 01:41:41,739
Yes sir, checking sir!

1561
01:41:43,906 --> 01:41:45,923
The storm's getting weaker
in the Pacific Ocean too.

1562
01:41:46,489 --> 01:41:47,698
By the time the satellite is in orbit...

1563
01:41:47,781 --> 01:41:49,823
the ships will be in their
tracking positions, sir.

1564
01:41:52,448 --> 01:41:53,698
PSLV ready for launch.

1565
01:41:53,989 --> 01:41:55,364
Mission Control waiting for command.

1566
01:41:55,489 --> 01:41:57,989
This is Rakesh Dhawan. Mission Control
initiating command for launch.

1567
01:41:58,073 --> 01:42:00,156
(Chants)

1568
01:42:00,739 --> 01:42:02,031
Hurry up, Panditji!

1569
01:42:08,781 --> 01:42:10,281
All departments ready for procedure!

1570
01:42:12,739 --> 01:42:13,907
All procedures start.

1571
01:42:15,031 --> 01:42:16,323
Satellite integration status...

1572
01:42:17,239 --> 01:42:19,698
100% integration. Good to go, sir!

1573
01:42:20,448 --> 01:42:21,614
Go/no go for payloads...

1574
01:42:22,323 --> 01:42:22,864
Go!

1575
01:42:23,239 --> 01:42:24,364
Communication and navigation...

1576
01:42:25,656 --> 01:42:26,364
Go, sir!

1577
01:42:26,781 --> 01:42:27,781
Program autonomy...

1578
01:42:28,239 --> 01:42:28,989
Go, sir!

1579
01:42:29,323 --> 01:42:30,364
Structural design...

1580
01:42:30,989 --> 01:42:31,656
Go!

1581
01:42:31,781 --> 01:42:32,781
Propulsion control...

1582
01:42:33,281 --> 01:42:34,114
Go!

1583
01:42:35,864 --> 01:42:39,323
We are good to go for launch!

1584
01:42:40,281 --> 01:42:42,711
Initialising countdown sequence...

1585
01:44:07,156 --> 01:44:09,823
The roll program is successful,
now entering MAX Q

1586
01:44:10,031 --> 01:44:10,739
Roger that.

1587
01:44:10,906 --> 01:44:15,156
Altitude 45,000 feet.
Velocity is at MACH 1.3

1588
01:44:22,239 --> 01:44:23,448
Sir, we are now ready for staging.

1589
01:44:23,573 --> 01:44:24,281
Copy that. Go!

1590
01:44:33,739 --> 01:44:35,406
First stage separation complete!

1591
01:44:44,864 --> 01:44:46,406
Second stage separation complete!

1592
01:44:51,198 --> 01:44:52,573
Fairing separation looks good

1593
01:45:00,156 --> 01:45:01,698
Third stage separation complete!

1594
01:45:08,573 --> 01:45:10,573
Earth marking orbit insertion complete.

1595
01:45:16,156 --> 01:45:18,156
Tracking stations active
over the Pacific Ocean.

1596
01:45:18,489 --> 01:45:20,114

1597
01:45:21,051 --> 01:45:23,051
Supervising control online, Sir!

1598
01:45:32,156 --> 01:45:33,781
Satellite approaching perigee.

1599
01:45:38,948 --> 01:45:41,062
Orbit raising manoeuvre 1...
Fire!

1600
01:45:48,323 --> 01:45:50,383
Engine shut down.
Back to fuel save mode.

1601
01:45:58,198 --> 01:46:00,447
Orbit raising manoeuvre 2...
Fire!

1602
01:46:03,864 --> 01:46:05,864
Engine shut down.
Back to fuel save mode.

1603
01:46:15,489 --> 01:46:16,739
Fire!

1604
01:46:19,364 --> 01:46:20,281
Fire!

1605
01:46:23,073 --> 01:46:23,614
Fire!

1606
01:46:30,239 --> 01:46:32,323
Final earth gravitational exit...
Fire!

1607
01:46:32,656 --> 01:46:33,198
Copy that.

1608
01:46:38,031 --> 01:46:39,281
Sir the engine isn't firing...

1609
01:46:39,489 --> 01:46:40,073
What?

1610
01:46:41,698 --> 01:46:43,323
The satellite is still
in the same orbit!

1611
01:46:44,323 --> 01:46:46,906
It will take 6 days for the satellite to
come back to the firing position

1612
01:46:47,031 --> 01:46:48,073
What!

1613
01:46:52,031 --> 01:46:54,823
We don't have a single buffer day,
no extra fuel!

1614
01:46:55,739 --> 01:46:57,281
How will we reach Mars on time?

1615
01:46:58,448 --> 01:47:00,198
We have fuel for one more firing sir.

1616
01:47:01,573 --> 01:47:04,030
But how we'll reach in time,
I don't know...

1617
01:47:04,163 --> 01:47:05,781
Sir, there's nothing much we can do.

1618
01:47:05,864 --> 01:47:07,364
Let's just hope for the best,
and go ahead.

1619
01:47:07,614 --> 01:47:09,147
Anyway, we have no choice!

1620
01:47:12,573 --> 01:47:13,614
Sorry for this...

1621
01:47:24,781 --> 01:47:26,989
Final Earth exit maximum fire!

1622
01:47:27,013 --> 01:47:28,571
Copy that.

1623
01:47:30,114 --> 01:47:31,114
Fire successful!

1624
01:47:38,180 --> 01:47:40,019
Satellite entering Van Allen Belt!

1625
01:47:59,739 --> 01:48:01,614
We have crossed the Van Allen Belt!

1626
01:48:02,156 --> 01:48:03,031
Yes!

1627
01:48:06,281 --> 01:48:08,406
Well done! Well done, folks!

1628
01:48:09,323 --> 01:48:10,364
Salute to the fried bread!

1629
01:48:10,573 --> 01:48:11,406
Come on, guys.

1630
01:48:11,989 --> 01:48:13,813
We're 6 days late!

1631
01:48:14,073 --> 01:48:19,454
Mars isn't going to wait because India has
managed to cross the Van Allen Belt!

1632
01:48:20,448 --> 01:48:22,698
10 months remain for
the final destination...

1633
01:48:23,198 --> 01:48:25,073
Please wait to celebrate our failure.

1634
01:49:26,837 --> 01:49:27,753
Hello?

1635
01:49:30,462 --> 01:49:30,878
What!

1636
01:49:31,045 --> 01:49:32,670
We've lost all communication!

1637
01:49:32,878 --> 01:49:34,170
Looks like the satellite got hit by

1638
01:49:34,253 --> 01:49:36,962
asteroids and solar
radiation all at once!

1639
01:49:37,045 --> 01:49:38,713
It could be a solar storm.

1640
01:49:41,170 --> 01:49:43,322
Back up systems will
fail any minute now!

1641
01:49:43,837 --> 01:49:46,072
Satellite has been in hang mode
for the last 20 minutes.

1642
01:49:55,003 --> 01:49:55,664
Kritika...

1643
01:49:56,587 --> 01:49:57,781
Kritika what are you doing?

1644
01:49:59,003 --> 01:49:59,878
What!

1645
01:50:00,670 --> 01:50:01,696
What did you do?

1646
01:50:03,128 --> 01:50:03,753
What!

1647
01:50:04,253 --> 01:50:05,545
Have you lost your mind?

1648
01:50:06,045 --> 01:50:08,071
How will you reestablish communication?

1649
01:50:08,170 --> 01:50:10,320
We have lost the satellite, Kritika!

1650
01:50:21,587 --> 01:50:23,128
Communication re-established!

1651
01:50:24,503 --> 01:50:27,295
We are back in control!
Reboot successful!

1652
01:50:29,503 --> 01:50:30,753
I'm sorry, ma'am

1653
01:50:31,003 --> 01:50:34,045
Switching it off and on was the
only thing I could think of!

1654
01:50:35,878 --> 01:50:38,920
Satellite speed is 72,000 kms/hr!

1655
01:50:39,503 --> 01:50:41,878
The solar storm has increased
the speed of the satellite!

1656
01:50:43,337 --> 01:50:45,128
We just made up the 6 day gap!

1657
01:50:46,795 --> 01:50:49,920
We will reach Mars on time!
With extra fuel!

1658
01:50:52,545 --> 01:50:54,962
You are a genius!

1659
01:50:57,170 --> 01:51:01,628
Eka, satellite is slightly off trajectory.
Fire all right thrusters.

1660
01:51:01,712 --> 01:51:02,628
I'm on it!

1661
01:51:05,337 --> 01:51:07,253
Neha, check tech damage!

1662
01:51:10,587 --> 01:51:13,878
Satellite autonomy intact, and
antenna in self repair mode!

1663
01:51:14,045 --> 01:51:15,128
Looks fine sir!

1664
01:51:31,295 --> 01:51:33,587
It's a historical day for India!

1665
01:51:33,920 --> 01:51:35,295
The whole world is watching us.

1666
01:51:35,503 --> 01:51:38,378
Today is the day that Mangalyaan
is all set to meet Mars!

1667
01:51:50,712 --> 01:51:53,587
The last leg of Mangalyaan
is the most difficult

1668
01:51:53,920 --> 01:51:55,253
The stage of entering Mars' orbit!

1669
01:51:55,337 --> 01:51:58,212
To enter Mars' orbit, Mangalyaan's
speed will have to come down...

1670
01:51:58,295 --> 01:52:02,920
from 72,000 km/hr to 15,000 km/hr.

1671
01:52:03,170 --> 01:52:05,962
Start procedures for
Mars orbit insertion!

1672
01:52:20,045 --> 01:52:23,587
Imagine a car travelling at 70,000 km/hr
without brakes...

1673
01:52:23,712 --> 01:52:25,003
How will it slow down?

1674
01:52:28,920 --> 01:52:31,545
If you reverse the car and press
the accelerator...

1675
01:52:31,712 --> 01:52:34,503
the reverse force can reduce
the speed.

1676
01:52:34,712 --> 01:52:38,337
180 degree axis reverse braking maneuver
to achieve speed reduction, sir.

1677
01:52:38,670 --> 01:52:39,462
Copy that!

1678
01:52:46,337 --> 01:52:48,462
Waking up LAM engine from hibernation!

1679
01:52:48,753 --> 01:52:50,545
Fire maximum all thrusters!

1680
01:52:59,003 --> 01:53:00,795
If the satellite's speed
cannot be reduced,

1681
01:53:01,003 --> 01:53:04,266
then it will go past Mars and
be lost in space forever.

1682
01:53:55,045 --> 01:53:56,295
Why isn't the speed reducing?

1683
01:53:56,628 --> 01:53:58,727
It should be 15,000. What is wrong?

1684
01:53:59,170 --> 01:54:02,212
Communication black out, sir.
Mangalyaan in eclipse mode.

1685
01:54:02,962 --> 01:54:05,712
We will have to wait 24 minutes
to find out if it's in orbit.

1686
01:54:10,920 --> 01:54:14,712
Has Mangalyaan entered Mars' orbit?
Or has it passed Mars?

1687
01:54:14,837 --> 01:54:20,337
If it has caught the orbit, it will
emerge from behind Mars...

1688
01:54:20,712 --> 01:54:25,128
In 24 minutes, we will know if the
Mars Mission is a success or a failure.

1689
01:54:28,003 --> 01:54:30,920
Please, please, please activate all
autonomous back up systems!

1690
01:54:31,670 --> 01:54:32,986
Will the battery back up be enough?

1691
01:54:33,295 --> 01:54:34,962
We'll know in 12 minutes!

1692
01:54:36,670 --> 01:54:41,795
If the satellite is safe I promise
to be celibate for life...

1693
01:54:44,337 --> 01:54:45,878
All aligned for orbit re-entry.

1694
01:54:46,295 --> 01:54:48,503
Orbit entry interface
expected any moment.

1695
01:55:16,087 --> 01:55:18,003
Sir, please pray...

1696
01:55:20,795 --> 01:55:23,920
I've never known any religion
other than science!

1697
01:55:24,587 --> 01:55:26,253
Come on!

1698
01:55:28,378 --> 01:55:31,212
Come on, come on, come on...

1699
01:56:14,837 --> 01:56:16,875
Ma'am, signal reaquisition picking!

1700
01:56:46,878 --> 01:56:49,753
Mangalyaan insertion in
Mars orbit successful sir!

1701
01:56:50,170 --> 01:56:52,985
Tell the whole world...Copy that!

1702
01:56:55,587 --> 01:56:58,212
Copy that!

1703
01:57:27,128 --> 01:57:28,795
Mars image coming up sir!

1704
01:58:01,045 --> 01:58:03,962
Dad, you forgot to pay the bill!

1705
01:58:44,920 --> 01:58:46,045
NASA would like to...

1706
01:58:46,128 --> 01:58:47,045
Not again!

1707
01:58:47,128 --> 01:58:48,795
NASA would like to collaborate
with us for its future missions!

1708
01:58:48,920 --> 01:58:49,587
What?

1709
01:58:49,920 --> 01:58:52,545
I'm getting calls from all over
the world! Thanks to you, Rakesh!

1710
01:58:52,837 --> 01:58:53,503
Not me.

1711
01:58:54,045 --> 01:58:56,852
Thank ISRO's 17,000
scientists and engineers.

1712
01:58:57,712 --> 01:59:00,259
Actually thank you too!

1713
01:59:00,503 --> 01:59:00,837
Me?

1714
01:59:01,003 --> 01:59:02,087
- Yeah!
- What did I do?!

1715
01:59:02,212 --> 01:59:05,253
A strong opposition pushes you to win!

1716
01:59:05,712 --> 01:59:08,795
And you, are a damn strong opposition.

1717
01:59:09,837 --> 01:59:12,878
- Congratulations!
- Yes! We did it!

1718
01:59:13,753 --> 01:59:14,337
What?

1719
01:59:14,545 --> 01:59:15,884
You didn't watch TV, why?

1720
01:59:16,837 --> 01:59:18,063
The power was cut off?

1721
01:59:18,795 --> 01:59:19,962
Sunil!

1722
01:59:20,212 --> 01:59:23,628
Sir, thankfully the mission
was called MOM.

1723
01:59:24,212 --> 01:59:28,753
If it was called DAD, it wouldn't
have stood a chance!

1724
01:59:30,837 --> 01:59:31,753
Let's go for coffee?

1725
01:59:33,087 --> 01:59:34,795
Didn't you swear to be celibate?

1726
01:59:35,170 --> 01:59:37,503
Mars has been conquered, who cares!

1727
01:59:37,587 --> 01:59:38,795
Thank you, thank you!

1728
01:59:39,170 --> 01:59:41,545
I'll be home soon. We'll
cook and eat dinner together.

1729
01:59:42,253 --> 01:59:45,128
Listen, if I have the government's
recommendation,

1730
01:59:45,212 --> 01:59:46,795
I'll get my driver's license right?

1731
01:59:46,920 --> 01:59:51,295
Ma'am do you think I'll get a small
living quarters at ISRO now?

1732
01:59:52,509 --> 01:59:53,503
Doubt it

1733
01:59:57,253 --> 02:00:01,795
Look at Mars! One day,
you can go there too.

1734
02:01:51,837 --> 02:02:00,670
India is the first nation in the world
to reach Mars on its very first attempt!

1735
02:02:03,253 --> 02:02:08,920
In Ahmedabad, to travel 1 km
by rickshaw costs Rs. 10

1736
02:02:09,712 --> 02:02:13,587
But it cost ISRO only Rs. 7
per kilometre to get to Mars!

1737
02:02:15,378 --> 02:02:17,003
And that's not all!

1738
02:02:18,087 --> 02:02:21,712
At a budget lesser than that
of a Hollywood space movie...

1739
02:02:21,837 --> 02:02:24,212
We actually went to Mars!
