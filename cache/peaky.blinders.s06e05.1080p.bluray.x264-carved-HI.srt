Into the fucking family
with a snap of his fingers.

No, I am bringing him
into the fold.

No.

But there may be forgiveness
from God.

144
00:10:45,841 --> 00:10:47,641
And you will do God's work?

145
00:10:47,761 --> 00:10:51,081
God is interested in you
as well, Tommy.

146
00:10:51,201 --> 00:10:53,041
And God will be with you
on your journey,

He may not need to take
many steps.

149
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,281
So, tell me this, Linda...

150
00:11:18,121 --> 00:11:20,281
...is God interested in me...

151
00:11:21,441 --> 00:11:23,281
...or in my money?

152
00:11:27,761 --> 00:11:29,441
I believe you run a foundation,

153
00:11:29,561 --> 00:11:32,801
and that your foundation has
many missions across the world,

154
00:11:32,921 --> 00:11:35,361
but in these times
of financial crisis,

155
00:11:35,481 --> 00:11:38,361
funding is hard to come by,
so perhaps...

156
00:11:39,521 --> 00:11:41,041
...your God's plan
is a practical one.

157
00:11:41,161 --> 00:11:44,361
Perhaps, He would like me
to make a donation

158
00:11:44,481 --> 00:11:46,041
to your foundation

159
00:11:46,161 --> 00:11:49,441
and, in return,
He would like you

160
00:11:49,561 --> 00:11:52,241
to help my brother on his road
to redemption.

161
00:11:53,361 --> 00:11:56,121
Now, I know that in a place
of worship such as this,

162
00:11:56,241 --> 00:11:57,841
you would never ask how much.

163
00:11:57,961 --> 00:11:59,721
So I will tell you plainly.

164
00:11:59,841 --> 00:12:04,121
I will write your foundation
a cheque for £10,000...

165
00:12:04,241 --> 00:12:05,401
Praise the Lord.

166
00:12:05,521 --> 00:12:08,881
...if you agree to look kindly
on Arthur and to help him.

167
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:14,081
I need to look after everyone
in the family.

168
00:12:16,841 --> 00:12:18,081
Do we have a deal?

169
00:12:21,481 --> 00:12:23,801
Your money will be spent
to do good around the world...

170
00:12:25,521 --> 00:12:27,121
...and a mission will be named
after you.

171
00:12:27,241 --> 00:12:28,321
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

172
00:12:30,881 --> 00:12:32,401
But I'm only agreeing
to help him...

173
00:12:33,561 --> 00:12:34,761
...not sleep with him.

174
00:12:35,881 --> 00:12:37,361
No.

175
00:12:37,481 --> 00:12:40,921
No, I imagine the negotiation
for that particular favour

176
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:43,281
would take a considerable
amount of time...

177
00:12:44,641 --> 00:12:45,921
...and I have an appointment.

178
00:12:47,921 --> 00:12:49,761
God bless.

179
00:12:53,561 --> 00:12:55,641
(SHIP'S HORN BLARES)

180
00:13:12,521 --> 00:13:14,841
Apologies for
the initial misunderstanding.

181
00:13:16,761 --> 00:13:18,201
My brother dealt with it.

182
00:13:25,241 --> 00:13:26,681
For the care you took.

183
00:13:28,081 --> 00:13:30,881
Even though
I succumbed to temptation?

184
00:13:31,001 --> 00:13:34,121
Part of the reason my brother
is back dealing with it

185
00:13:34,241 --> 00:13:35,841
is down to you.

186
00:13:35,961 --> 00:13:37,281
You spoke to him.

187
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:38,601
As a comrade.

188
00:13:38,721 --> 00:13:40,201
The beating
is still owed to you.

189
00:13:40,321 --> 00:13:42,081
Do you still do that kind
of work yourself,

190
00:13:42,201 --> 00:13:43,721
Thomas Shelby, MP?

191
00:13:45,081 --> 00:13:48,801
Mr Stagg, you see,
I can use men like you.

192
00:13:50,881 --> 00:13:54,401
I have friends
that are in need of guns.

193
00:13:55,681 --> 00:13:59,441
Soon, there will be a shipment
of Thompson sub-machine guns

194
00:13:59,561 --> 00:14:02,121
coming here from Boston.

195
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:05,201
And I need you to unload
and store those weapons.

196
00:14:07,121 --> 00:14:09,481
There will also be
ammunition...

197
00:14:10,921 --> 00:14:12,081
...like this.

198
00:14:13,241 --> 00:14:14,521
You have a good look.

199
00:14:15,641 --> 00:14:17,761
And I need you
to take better care

200
00:14:17,881 --> 00:14:19,641
of the guns and ammunition

201
00:14:19,761 --> 00:14:21,321
than you did of the powder.

202
00:14:22,601 --> 00:14:23,601
You understand?

203
00:14:24,761 --> 00:14:26,641
Previously,

204
00:14:26,761 --> 00:14:31,121
all of my import and export
went through Belfast docks.

205
00:14:31,241 --> 00:14:33,081
Now we're dealing
with Boston...

206
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:39,801
...I'm considering shifting
my supply line to Liverpool.

207
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:42,441
You'll be a very rich man.

208
00:14:46,401 --> 00:14:48,361
Don't you ever say thank you?

209
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:07,561
Thank you.

210
00:15:12,481 --> 00:15:14,681
Is that why you do it,
Mr Shelby?

211
00:15:16,121 --> 00:15:18,321
Is that why you keep
all this going?

212
00:15:18,441 --> 00:15:20,441
To have people say thank you?

213
00:15:22,001 --> 00:15:24,041
You could close all this down.

214
00:15:24,161 --> 00:15:26,441
You could leave the sport
behind.

215
00:15:26,561 --> 00:15:29,521
You could live like
an ordinary mortal man.

216
00:15:29,641 --> 00:15:32,161
On your gravestone -

217
00:15:32,281 --> 00:15:34,041
"an ordinary mortal man".

218
00:15:35,641 --> 00:15:37,281
But, instead,

219
00:15:37,401 --> 00:15:40,881
you still go round collecting
"please" and "thank you"

220
00:15:41,001 --> 00:15:44,081
and "sorry"
and "forgive me, Mr Shelby".

221
00:15:45,961 --> 00:15:47,361
That what it's all for?

222
00:15:50,201 --> 00:15:51,241
You want to know?

223
00:15:52,681 --> 00:15:54,201
You want to know
why I've carried on...

224
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:57,601
(EXHALES)...all these years?

225
00:15:58,881 --> 00:16:00,281
It's so I can do this.

226
00:16:05,161 --> 00:16:06,641
And then...

227
00:16:07,921 --> 00:16:09,161
...do this.

228
00:16:13,761 --> 00:16:15,081
Feel it?

229
00:16:17,001 --> 00:16:18,321
I feel it.

230
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:22,481
Junk doesn't even come close.

231
00:16:26,961 --> 00:16:28,281
Soon, Mr Stagg...

232
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:32,481
...when my last bit of business
is done...

233
00:16:34,801 --> 00:16:36,121
...I will indeed...

234
00:16:37,721 --> 00:16:39,441
...be an ordinary mortal man.

235
00:16:42,561 --> 00:16:43,761
You have a good day.

236
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:54,241
Arthur, we've got a problem
with a referee.

237
00:16:54,361 --> 00:16:55,761
He's not taking the money.

238
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:57,481
He's fucking religious
or something.

239
00:16:57,601 --> 00:16:59,361
Jesus Christ.

240
00:17:01,921 --> 00:17:04,481
With Tommy away, you're in
charge of gambling, Arthur,

241
00:17:04,601 --> 00:17:05,681
what shall we do?

242
00:17:06,921 --> 00:17:08,801
"And this they said to him,

243
00:17:08,921 --> 00:17:12,481
"that they may have some charge
to bring against him."

244
00:17:12,601 --> 00:17:13,841
Arthur, this referee,

245
00:17:13,961 --> 00:17:16,281
he's threatening
to go to the police...

246
00:17:16,401 --> 00:17:17,401
"Jesus...

247
00:17:18,441 --> 00:17:20,161
"...bent down,

248
00:17:20,281 --> 00:17:23,441
"and with one finger,
he wrote on the ground..."

249
00:17:23,561 --> 00:17:25,721
Arthur... brother...

250
00:17:27,721 --> 00:17:29,521
...people are laughing at you.

251
00:17:32,561 --> 00:17:35,481
So I just phoned
our holy referee again.

252
00:17:35,601 --> 00:17:38,881
He basically told me
to fuck off.

253
00:17:39,001 --> 00:17:40,401
Not even basically, actually.

254
00:17:40,521 --> 00:17:42,121
He literally just told me to...

255
00:17:42,241 --> 00:17:44,121
- ...to fuck off.
- ARTHUR: Is that right?

256
00:17:44,241 --> 00:17:46,761
So, do you know?

257
00:17:46,881 --> 00:17:48,361
Oh, for fuck's sake.

258
00:17:48,481 --> 00:17:50,281
Do you know what he wrote
on the ground?

259
00:17:50,401 --> 00:17:51,401
- Hmm?
- No.

260
00:17:51,481 --> 00:17:52,481
- Do you know?
- No.

261
00:17:52,521 --> 00:17:54,017
- You don't know, do you?
- No, I don't.

262
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:55,881
Billy, do you know
what he wrote on the ground?

263
00:17:55,921 --> 00:17:57,201
- I...
- Hmm?

264
00:17:58,361 --> 00:18:00,121
Do you know what Jesus wrote
on the ground?

265
00:18:00,241 --> 00:18:01,721
He bent down,

266
00:18:01,841 --> 00:18:04,841
and with one finger,
he wrote on the fucking ground.

267
00:18:04,961 --> 00:18:06,961
Do you know?
Do you know what he wrote?

268
00:18:07,081 --> 00:18:09,201
- Come on, Billy.
- No.

269
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:11,521
Arthur, what should we do?

270
00:18:12,641 --> 00:18:14,441
Go and get me the referee.

271
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:17,241
Bring me the fucking referee.

272
00:19:26,601 --> 00:19:28,041
I know she's here with us.

273
00:19:31,321 --> 00:19:32,441
Always.

274
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:39,961
But still,
it's just you and me.

275
00:19:48,441 --> 00:19:49,761
I thought it'd be good

276
00:19:49,881 --> 00:19:51,521
if we were
in a different place.

277
00:19:54,121 --> 00:19:55,401
I hate that house now.

278
00:19:56,681 --> 00:19:58,321
I wish I could blow it up.

279
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:11,361
There was a time when we'd say
nothing afterwards

280
00:20:11,481 --> 00:20:14,361
because we didn't have
to say anything.

281
00:20:18,481 --> 00:20:20,521
Now we've got nothing left
to say.

282
00:20:25,921 --> 00:20:27,201
There's business.

283
00:20:31,561 --> 00:20:32,681
What business?

284
00:20:36,481 --> 00:20:37,761
The American.

285
00:20:39,641 --> 00:20:41,161
He's coming to Birmingham.

286
00:20:42,321 --> 00:20:44,401
He's stopping over
on his way to Liverpool.

287
00:20:45,721 --> 00:20:47,961
He's staying with us
tomorrow night.

288
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:49,241
Frances knows.

289
00:20:49,361 --> 00:20:50,841
She's been making up a menu.

290
00:20:54,641 --> 00:20:56,001
And then...

291
00:20:57,681 --> 00:20:59,121
...we have to make a move.

292
00:21:02,841 --> 00:21:04,801
Do you want to know
what that move is, Lizzie?

293
00:21:07,681 --> 00:21:08,721
No.

294
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:12,281
I know enough.

295
00:21:16,361 --> 00:21:18,241
Your book of regrets.

296
00:21:23,001 --> 00:21:24,601
23, 24...

297
00:21:25,721 --> 00:21:27,121
...52, 55.

298
00:21:29,481 --> 00:21:31,361
The combination to the safe.

299
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:36,361
Regrets.

300
00:21:37,961 --> 00:21:39,001
And I'm on there.

301
00:21:40,081 --> 00:21:41,081
I'm on the list.

302
00:21:42,201 --> 00:21:45,161
On the very top of the list.

303
00:21:50,801 --> 00:21:51,881
Yep.

304
00:21:53,161 --> 00:21:54,481
Yes, you are.

305
00:21:58,041 --> 00:21:59,801
I regret marrying you, Lizzie.

306
00:22:03,521 --> 00:22:05,321
Cos I've put you through
so much.

307
00:22:06,761 --> 00:22:07,881
Put you through all of this.

308
00:22:09,481 --> 00:22:10,481
Ruby.

309
00:22:12,521 --> 00:22:14,121
Everything that is to come.

310
00:22:17,681 --> 00:22:18,761
When you married me,

311
00:22:18,881 --> 00:22:21,241
you married a man
and you married a curse.

312
00:22:22,401 --> 00:22:23,921
You have shared my fate.

313
00:22:27,401 --> 00:22:28,921
That is my regret.

314
00:22:33,441 --> 00:22:34,601
But know this, Lizzie.

315
00:22:36,561 --> 00:22:38,201
In this moment,

316
00:22:38,321 --> 00:22:39,721
in this room...

317
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,601
...I love you.

318
00:22:51,321 --> 00:22:53,801
You sound like
you're ticking a fucking box,

319
00:22:53,921 --> 00:22:56,201
and I don't know
what's inside the box!

320
00:22:59,761 --> 00:23:02,921
Never have you let me in...

321
00:23:05,841 --> 00:23:08,241
...even though I know
the combination to the safe.

322
00:23:16,321 --> 00:23:17,881
(EXHALES)

323
00:23:48,241 --> 00:23:49,281
So this is him, is it?

324
00:23:49,401 --> 00:23:53,201
The one who likes
to be fucking difficult, eh?

325
00:23:53,321 --> 00:23:54,321
When I leave this place,

326
00:23:54,441 --> 00:23:55,881
I'm going straight
to the police.

327
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:57,721
- You are?

00:33:53,841 --> 00:33:55,921
For so fu...

490
00:33:56,041 --> 00:33:57,281
For so long.

491
00:34:17,761 --> 00:34:19,201
Caught him stealing a car,

492
00:34:19,321 --> 00:34:22,281
and he's got a stack of cash
from the betting shop.

493
00:34:35,601 --> 00:34:37,681
Steal from who you want.

494
00:34:37,801 --> 00:34:38,921
But don't steal from me.

495
00:34:41,441 --> 00:34:42,601
Here you are.

496
00:34:44,801 --> 00:34:46,441
Get a train

497
00:34:46,561 --> 00:34:48,321
to wherever the fuck
you want to go. Get out.

498
00:34:48,441 --> 00:34:50,361
- I don't ride trains.
- That a fact?

499
00:34:53,481 --> 00:34:55,561
Well, Curly has
a two-wheeled wagon.

500
00:34:56,721 --> 00:34:58,001
What am I, a tinker?

501
00:34:58,121 --> 00:34:59,641
I need four wheels.

502
00:34:59,761 --> 00:35:02,441
And a horse for the hills.

503
00:35:05,761 --> 00:35:07,721
Which hills?

504
00:35:07,841 --> 00:35:10,561
All of them.
All the hills of England.

505
00:35:11,601 --> 00:35:13,401
(CHUCKLES)

506
00:35:15,681 --> 00:35:16,681
Why do you want to leave?

507
00:35:21,121 --> 00:35:23,041
I didn't take to that work
in the betting shop.

508
00:35:27,081 --> 00:35:28,401
Well, you heard him, Charlie.

509
00:35:29,601 --> 00:35:32,281
Get my dad's old four-wheeled
wagon and two strong ponies.

510
00:35:32,401 --> 00:35:33,521
Right.

511
00:35:34,601 --> 00:35:37,241
Curly! Get here.

512
00:35:42,801 --> 00:35:44,401
Before you go,

513
00:35:44,521 --> 00:35:46,521
do you want to know the truth
about yourself?

514
00:35:48,361 --> 00:35:50,481
No. Who does?

515
00:35:52,521 --> 00:35:53,961
Right, well,
I'm going to tell you.

516
00:35:55,081 --> 00:35:56,601
That spring at Appleby Fair,

517
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:58,721
your mother stole
my watch and chain.

518
00:35:58,841 --> 00:36:00,521
You're from a long line
of thieves.

519
00:36:01,681 --> 00:36:05,721
The watch had the words
"Saxon Shore" carved in it.

520
00:36:05,841 --> 00:36:08,361
Stole it meself from a drunk
when I was a kid.

521
00:36:09,841 --> 00:36:10,841
I imagine she told you

522
00:36:10,921 --> 00:36:13,361
your dad was the Duke
of the Saxon Shore. Well...

523
00:36:14,801 --> 00:36:16,361
...I'm the Duke,

524
00:36:16,481 --> 00:36:17,721
It was my watch.

525
00:36:18,841 --> 00:36:20,001
I'm your father.

526
00:36:22,601 --> 00:36:23,601
That's the truth.

527
00:36:24,881 --> 00:36:25,961
When her dad found out,

528
00:36:26,081 --> 00:36:28,641
he shot me in the chest
with a squirrel gun.

529
00:36:29,721 --> 00:36:34,521
A scar and a stolen watch
and a story she made up.

530
00:36:36,321 --> 00:36:38,001
That's all you need to know
about yourself

531
00:36:38,121 --> 00:36:39,601
before you get on the road.

532
00:36:52,401 --> 00:36:54,401
Esme tells me
the spirits favour you.

533
00:36:56,161 --> 00:36:57,921
That the spirit is in you.

534
00:36:58,041 --> 00:37:00,681
She tried to sell me like one
of those horses, didn't she?

535
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:04,041
How much did she pay for me?

536
00:37:05,441 --> 00:37:06,801
I've no use for gold any more.

537
00:37:08,081 --> 00:37:09,441
But if you <i>are</i> a horse,

538
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:11,041
you're in the right place.

539
00:37:12,641 --> 00:37:13,761
Curly!

540
00:37:16,161 --> 00:37:17,641
Curly, hurry up!

541
00:37:18,681 --> 00:37:20,361
This boy has hills to climb.

542
00:37:23,481 --> 00:37:24,921
I remember that watch.

543
00:37:27,441 --> 00:37:28,961
Oh, yeah?

544
00:37:30,361 --> 00:37:32,081
She used to wear it
over her heart.

545
00:37:35,241 --> 00:37:37,121
We buried it with her.

546
00:37:39,961 --> 00:37:41,001
Tom.

547
00:37:41,121 --> 00:37:44,001
The old wagon's right
front wheel is fucked, Tom.

548
00:37:44,121 --> 00:37:45,401
It's standing in the wet.

549
00:37:46,761 --> 00:37:48,001
Put a new wheel on, Curly.

550
00:37:51,081 --> 00:37:52,081
Yeah.

551
00:37:54,721 --> 00:37:56,161
Fix wagons here.

552
00:37:57,961 --> 00:38:00,521
Good families
come from the New Forest

553
00:38:00,641 --> 00:38:02,481
to get their wagons fixed

554
00:38:02,601 --> 00:38:04,801
and fresh horses
before the fairs.

555
00:38:08,081 --> 00:38:10,521
Yeah. Yeah, I like it here.

556
00:38:11,761 --> 00:38:13,441
I like it better than
that betting shop.

557
00:38:16,361 --> 00:38:17,361
Why?

558
00:38:18,561 --> 00:38:19,561
People.

559
00:38:20,761 --> 00:38:21,881
People piss me off.

560
00:38:24,081 --> 00:38:25,921
There are a lot of people
in that betting shop.

561
00:38:27,521 --> 00:38:29,801
So far, here... What?
I've only counted two.

562
00:38:29,921 --> 00:38:30,921
Mm-hm.

563
00:38:32,001 --> 00:38:33,161
Charlie and Curly.

564
00:38:33,281 --> 00:38:35,001
The rest is dogs and horses.

565
00:38:35,121 --> 00:38:36,801
Curly's half horse himself.

566
00:38:38,201 --> 00:38:39,441
Dogs are OK.

567
00:38:40,601 --> 00:38:42,521
Horses are better than people,
mind you.

568
00:38:45,841 --> 00:38:48,241
There's work here
for a man who knows horses.

569
00:38:51,721 --> 00:38:52,881
Unknown.

570
00:38:54,281 --> 00:38:56,561
I want to remain
completely unknown.

571
00:38:56,681 --> 00:38:57,681
Well, you'd be

572
00:38:57,721 --> 00:38:58,857
in the right place
for that as well.

573
00:38:58,881 --> 00:39:00,001
No-one knows anyone here.

574
00:39:02,401 --> 00:39:04,281
Hey, mister!
Save that wheel a minute.

575
00:39:06,441 --> 00:39:07,641
Where would I stay?

576
00:39:09,361 --> 00:39:12,321
Stables,
with the other stallions.

577
00:39:13,681 --> 00:39:15,241
Now that Finn is married off,

578
00:39:15,361 --> 00:39:17,241
plenty of girls round here.

579
00:39:17,361 --> 00:39:20,841
Fathers are mostly unarmed.

580
00:39:24,681 --> 00:39:27,041
I have a future for you, Duke.

581
00:39:28,521 --> 00:39:30,521
You already have a son.

582
00:39:31,881 --> 00:39:34,201
My business has two sides.

583
00:39:35,441 --> 00:39:36,761
Light and dark.

584
00:39:37,841 --> 00:39:39,761
I'll need someone for each.

585
00:39:40,801 --> 00:39:42,521
And I'm dark, am I?

586
00:39:44,001 --> 00:39:46,761
I've realised we don't get
to choose which one we are.

587
00:39:48,481 --> 00:39:49,641
Dark knows dark.

588
00:39:51,281 --> 00:39:53,601
And my affairs,
both light and dark...

589
00:39:54,881 --> 00:39:56,441
...will need settling soon.

590
00:39:58,361 --> 00:39:59,401
Curly!

591
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:03,801
Find a shovel for the Duke
of the Saxon Shore here.

592
00:40:03,921 --> 00:40:05,801
Get him shovelling shit.

593
00:40:05,921 --> 00:40:07,001
(SNORTS)

594
00:40:07,121 --> 00:40:08,961
And put some petrol
in the boat.

595
00:40:09,081 --> 00:40:11,081
I'm off to meet a lady
in Solihull.

596
00:40:50,841 --> 00:40:51,961
Take a look at her.

597
00:40:53,921 --> 00:40:56,401
Now imagine ten people
living on side.

598
00:40:58,441 --> 00:41:00,121
Step on. Have a look inside.

599
00:41:06,121 --> 00:41:09,001
I've had a response
from the Guinness Trust

600
00:41:09,121 --> 00:41:12,081
about building
charitable housing

601
00:41:12,201 --> 00:41:15,321
at two sites
along the canal network

602
00:41:15,441 --> 00:41:17,041
between London,

603
00:41:17,161 --> 00:41:18,801
Birmingham and Liverpool.

604
00:41:18,921 --> 00:41:22,641
This lock here would be
the one of the sites.

605
00:41:23,841 --> 00:41:26,961
I have the permission.
Just need the finance.

606
00:41:29,321 --> 00:41:31,441
I know that you and your
husband, Bryan Guinness,

607
00:41:31,561 --> 00:41:32,601
are estranged,

608
00:41:32,721 --> 00:41:35,281
but I understand
you still have influence

609
00:41:35,401 --> 00:41:36,521
in the Guinness family.

610
00:41:37,641 --> 00:41:40,281
Your support might help them
make their decision.

611
00:41:40,401 --> 00:41:41,801
Will you help me?

612
00:41:51,441 --> 00:41:54,001
I've booked a suite in a hotel
a mile from here.

613
00:41:55,121 --> 00:41:56,801
My chauffeur
will take us there.

614
00:41:58,761 --> 00:41:59,921
You look quite the thing

615
00:42:00,041 --> 00:42:02,721
dressed like that,
dressed like a working man.

616
00:42:02,841 --> 00:42:04,377
They'll probably show you
to the coalhouse

617
00:42:04,401 --> 00:42:06,241
to make your delivery.

618
00:42:06,361 --> 00:42:08,601
Yep, they probably will.

619
00:42:11,761 --> 00:42:13,761
Oswald has fucked your wife,

620
00:42:13,881 --> 00:42:16,481
so my suggestion is
about balance and proportion.

621
00:42:17,761 --> 00:42:18,961
It would be only fair.

622
00:42:22,401 --> 00:42:24,201
Can I assume...

623
00:42:25,401 --> 00:42:26,681
...I have your support?

624
00:42:30,841 --> 00:42:32,681
This isn't about
charitable housing -

625
00:42:32,801 --> 00:42:34,241
this is about changing
the world.

626
00:42:35,321 --> 00:42:37,201
It's about a different kind
of trust.

627
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:39,241
Absolute trust.

628
00:42:40,601 --> 00:42:42,561
We have important work
ahead of us.

629
00:42:44,521 --> 00:42:46,481
It's much harder to lie
with your body

630
00:42:46,601 --> 00:42:47,801
than with your words.

631
00:42:49,281 --> 00:42:50,521
This, I have learnt.

632
00:42:58,641 --> 00:43:00,481
Mostly,
I do whatever I want to do.

633
00:43:01,761 --> 00:43:03,841
Sometimes,
I do things for the cause.

634
00:43:03,961 --> 00:43:05,921
In this case, it's both.

635
00:43:09,201 --> 00:43:10,281
Come.

636
00:43:36,881 --> 00:43:38,881
In the interests
of absolute clarity,

637
00:43:39,001 --> 00:43:40,481
that is simply

638
00:43:40,601 --> 00:43:43,121
the English aristocracy's way
of shaking hands.

639
00:43:46,761 --> 00:43:47,761
So...

640
00:43:48,881 --> 00:43:50,041
...welcome.

641
00:46:35,161 --> 00:46:36,521
POLLY: <i>If you do this thing...</i>

642
00:46:38,361 --> 00:46:42,281
<i>...the possibility of war,
you have to consider.</i>

643
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:49,081
MICHAEL: <i>It was the ambitions</i>

644
00:46:49,201 --> 00:46:51,401
<i>and strategies of one man
that caused this.</i>

645
00:46:54,961 --> 00:46:57,601
POLLY: <i>There will be a war
in this family,</i>

646
00:46:57,721 --> 00:47:00,161
<i>and one of you will die.</i>

647
00:47:25,841 --> 00:47:26,881
We need to leave early

648
00:47:27,001 --> 00:47:29,241
to catch the first train
to Liverpool, yes?

649
00:47:29,361 --> 00:47:30,921
Yep.

650
00:47:31,041 --> 00:47:33,081
So we eat early, finish early.

651
00:47:38,361 --> 00:47:40,201
You changed the combination
of the safe.

652
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:42,521
Why?

653
00:47:43,761 --> 00:47:45,041
Have you got new secrets?

654
00:47:46,281 --> 00:47:48,161
With the new business
at hand...

655
00:47:49,481 --> 00:47:50,641
...there are some things...

656
00:47:51,801 --> 00:47:53,201
...that I cannot share.

657
00:47:53,321 --> 00:47:55,481
What things?

658
00:48:00,761 --> 00:48:02,121
What are those tablets?

659
00:48:02,241 --> 00:48:03,761
Doctor gave them me.

660
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:05,481
Painkillers?

661
00:48:05,601 --> 00:48:07,801
- Yeah.
- What pain?

662
00:48:09,201 --> 00:48:11,681
Any pain that comes, Lizzie.

663
00:48:34,041 --> 00:48:36,721
When you're ready, I want you
to tell me everything

664
00:48:36,841 --> 00:48:38,041
that's going on.

665
00:48:41,081 --> 00:48:42,881
It's like the clock's
stopped ticking

666
00:48:43,001 --> 00:48:45,081
and I'm waiting
for the bomb to explode.

667
00:48:49,361 --> 00:48:51,121
We're in that quiet minute.

668
00:48:57,481 --> 00:48:58,841
Tommy?

669
00:49:07,201 --> 00:49:09,681
That's where we live now.

670
00:49:11,201 --> 00:49:12,681
When I know everything...

671
00:49:14,801 --> 00:49:16,281
...I will tell you everything.

672
00:49:33,241 --> 00:49:35,081
NELSON: Oh, no,
Gina's running wild, you see.

673
00:49:35,201 --> 00:49:37,881
Harrods, dope, amphetamines,
lords and ladies,

674
00:49:38,001 --> 00:49:40,001
you know, the whole
English aristocracy thing.

675
00:49:40,121 --> 00:49:42,401
Fuck wine - whiskey.

676
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:44,281
Shelby, you having whiskey?

677
00:49:44,401 --> 00:49:46,361
- I'll stay on wine.
- Fuck wine, more whiskey.

678
00:49:46,481 --> 00:49:50,001
I'm celebrating.
Celebration, you know.

679
00:49:50,121 --> 00:49:51,521
Getting off
this fucking island.

680
00:49:51,641 --> 00:49:52,961
You see,
the thing with England,

681
00:49:53,081 --> 00:49:55,521
the currency here,
it's not money.

682
00:49:55,641 --> 00:49:58,161
Nah, you got bored of money
a long time ago.

683
00:49:59,441 --> 00:50:00,881
Cos, you know,
anyone can have money,

684
00:50:01,001 --> 00:50:02,321
you can fucking...

685
00:50:04,761 --> 00:50:07,241
...you can fucking find money
in the mud.

686
00:50:07,361 --> 00:50:09,241
You can forge money.

687
00:50:09,361 --> 00:50:12,761
Mr Shelby, you can steal money,
am I right?

688
00:50:13,961 --> 00:50:15,201
The currency here...

689
00:50:16,201 --> 00:50:17,441
...it's blood.

690
00:50:19,721 --> 00:50:22,801
And Mr Shelby knows that
better than all of them.

691
00:50:22,921 --> 00:50:23,921
Blood here is like wine,

692
00:50:24,001 --> 00:50:25,561
like the vintage wine
in that bottle.

693
00:50:25,681 --> 00:50:28,081
It's the... It's the label,
it's the terroir,

694
00:50:28,201 --> 00:50:30,401
it's the grape
that makes the wine.

695
00:50:30,521 --> 00:50:32,241
Who fucking cares
about the glass around it?

696
00:50:32,321 --> 00:50:35,641
And you, my friend,
you're an American.

697
00:50:35,761 --> 00:50:37,641
You fucking... (BANGS TABLE)
...smash the glass,

698
00:50:37,721 --> 00:50:39,001
you spill the blood

699
00:50:39,121 --> 00:50:41,361
and you spend their currency
to get what you want.

700
00:50:42,481 --> 00:50:43,921
Am I right?

701
00:50:46,161 --> 00:50:48,001
When you come to America,

702
00:50:48,121 --> 00:50:50,521
I will show you things.

703
00:50:50,641 --> 00:50:52,321
You're going to America?

704
00:50:54,721 --> 00:50:58,241
To Canada, Lizzie, to collect
payment for the shipment.

705
00:50:58,361 --> 00:51:00,121
I need to do it myself.

706
00:51:01,281 --> 00:51:02,801
And who will be going with you?

707
00:51:02,921 --> 00:51:05,361
Michael will be there
to watch his back.

708
00:51:05,481 --> 00:51:08,001
Another journey, Tommy?

709
00:51:08,121 --> 00:51:10,321
$5 million, Mrs Shelby.

710
00:51:10,441 --> 00:51:12,481
It's worth a little cruise,
don't you think?

711
00:51:16,401 --> 00:51:18,041
You know whiskey does talk...

712
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:21,241
...Mr Nelson,
and sometimes whiskey is...

713
00:51:22,361 --> 00:51:23,881
...very eloquent.

714
00:51:25,441 --> 00:51:29,361
But $5 million, Mr Nelson...

715
00:51:31,441 --> 00:51:32,641
...that is a legacy.

716
00:51:34,601 --> 00:51:38,401
And when I come back,
I will know everything.

717
00:51:40,841 --> 00:51:45,961
I see myself so clearly
in you, Thomas Shelby.

718
00:51:47,401 --> 00:51:50,441
You are a man with a bright
and glittering future.

719
00:51:50,561 --> 00:51:51,801
(DOOR OPENS)

720
00:51:53,001 --> 00:51:54,161
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACH)

721
00:51:54,281 --> 00:51:56,521
FRANCES: Mr Shelby, there's
a car coming up the drive.

722
00:51:56,641 --> 00:51:58,121
A Rolls-Royce.

723
00:51:58,241 --> 00:51:59,681
Were you expecting more guests?

724
00:52:01,761 --> 00:52:02,921
No.

725
00:52:10,401 --> 00:52:11,841
Excuse me.

726
00:52:19,601 --> 00:52:21,841
We were on our way
to my constituency in Smethwick

727
00:52:21,961 --> 00:52:23,681
and I heard our American friend

728
00:52:23,801 --> 00:52:26,161
was in Birmingham
and that he was coming here,

729
00:52:26,281 --> 00:52:29,801
so we came
to say one last farewell.

730
00:52:32,921 --> 00:52:35,481
Champagne.
We have much to celebrate.

731
00:52:43,681 --> 00:52:45,961
It isn't that I wasn't sure
Mr Shelby would give you

732
00:52:46,081 --> 00:52:47,121
an excellent send-off,

733
00:52:47,241 --> 00:52:52,121
I just felt, since telegrams
and wires and letters

734
00:52:52,241 --> 00:52:54,361
can so easily be intercepted,

735
00:52:54,481 --> 00:52:56,241
we might confirm
all that we've achieved

736
00:52:56,361 --> 00:52:57,721
during your visit

737
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:59,201
over champagne.

738
00:53:00,361 --> 00:53:01,361
It is remarkable

739
00:53:01,441 --> 00:53:03,841
how quickly our relationships
have developed.

740
00:53:03,961 --> 00:53:06,521
So many triangles in this room.

741
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:09,961
Everyone except from Mr Nelson
is the point of a triangle.

742
00:53:10,961 --> 00:53:13,481
How am I part of a triangle?

743
00:53:13,601 --> 00:53:17,241
Mr Nelson,
you have all that you came for?

744
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:19,921
I have confirmation
that the future of Europe

745
00:53:20,041 --> 00:53:22,561
is in the hands
of men like yourselves.

746
00:53:22,681 --> 00:53:27,481
And that urgent conversations
between Washington, Rome,

747
00:53:27,601 --> 00:53:30,521
and of course Berlin
can now begin.

748
00:53:30,641 --> 00:53:34,361
A two-week visit that may have
changed the course of history.

749
00:53:35,641 --> 00:53:37,201
We all got what we wanted.

750
00:53:37,321 --> 00:53:38,681
Yes.

751
00:53:38,801 --> 00:53:40,321
And I got what I have wanted

752
00:53:40,441 --> 00:53:42,401
from the moment
I set eyes on it.

753
00:53:48,001 --> 00:53:50,921
Elizabeth,
you are a very lucky woman...

754
00:53:52,161 --> 00:53:55,841
...to have each day
what I have only sampled once.

755
00:53:58,001 --> 00:53:59,001
(SCOFFS)

756
00:54:19,001 --> 00:54:20,401
Forgive us, Mr Nelson,

757
00:54:20,521 --> 00:54:22,121
that was a necessary bit
of housekeeping.

758
00:54:28,001 --> 00:54:29,081
Thomas...

759
00:54:30,881 --> 00:54:33,001
...we do so hate
to be indiscreet, but...

760
00:54:34,321 --> 00:54:36,041
...we have told you
many times,

761
00:54:36,161 --> 00:54:37,321
if you are to seek power

762
00:54:37,441 --> 00:54:40,801
in these days
of shiny magazines

763
00:54:40,921 --> 00:54:43,161
and society photographs,

764
00:54:43,281 --> 00:54:45,521
sooner or later,
you will have to find a spouse

765
00:54:45,641 --> 00:54:46,841
who's more suitable.

766
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:50,081
A woman with Lizzie's past

767
00:54:50,201 --> 00:54:52,761
and personal history
really isn't suitable.

768
00:54:55,281 --> 00:54:57,201
She doesn't deserve you,
Mr Shelby.

769
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:22,961
You know, the thing is,
Mosley...

770
00:55:24,641 --> 00:55:25,761
...you're right.

771
00:55:29,001 --> 00:55:30,721
You're right,
she doesn't deserve me.

772
00:55:35,681 --> 00:55:37,121
She doesn't deserve what I am.

773
00:55:39,801 --> 00:55:42,321
She doesn't deserve
what I will become.

774
00:55:42,441 --> 00:55:44,041
What will you become?

775
00:55:45,121 --> 00:55:47,641
Truth is, I belong here,
at this table,

776
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:49,681
with fuckers like you.

777
00:55:51,921 --> 00:55:53,321
She doesn't.

778
00:55:56,561 --> 00:55:58,841
For all I try to hide it...

779
00:56:00,601 --> 00:56:02,441
(CHUCKLES)
...I'm just one of you.

780
00:56:07,361 --> 00:56:09,561
Could there be a sadder ending,
eh?

781
00:57:10,481 --> 00:57:11,961
I'm here on behalf
of your wife, Gina,

782
00:57:12,001 --> 00:57:13,321
and Jack Nelson.

783
00:57:13,441 --> 00:57:15,961
Mr Nelson's prepared
to get you out of here.

784
00:57:17,121 --> 00:57:19,681
But first he needs an answer
to a question.

785
00:57:21,481 --> 00:57:22,761
If the answer is yes...

786
00:57:24,361 --> 00:57:25,441
...you'll be released.

787
00:57:27,961 --> 00:57:29,121
If the answer is no...

788
00:57:30,441 --> 00:57:31,641
...you'll stay.

789
00:57:34,961 --> 00:57:36,441
I have consulted my mother.

790
00:57:37,601 --> 00:57:38,841
Your mother's dead.

791
00:57:41,481 --> 00:57:43,201
Nevertheless,
I have consulted her.

792
00:57:46,841 --> 00:57:47,841
And yes.

793
00:57:49,481 --> 00:57:50,561
When I'm released,

794
00:57:50,681 --> 00:57:52,721
it is my intention
to kill Tommy Shelby.
