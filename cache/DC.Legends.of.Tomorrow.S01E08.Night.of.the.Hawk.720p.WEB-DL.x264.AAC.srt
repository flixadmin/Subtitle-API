<i>In 2166, an immortal tyrant
named Vandal Savage</i>

3
00:00:04,905 --> 00:00:07,506
<i>conquered the world
and murdered my wife and child.</i>

4
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:10,509
<i>I have assembled an elite team
to hunt him throughout time</i>

5
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:12,177
<i>and stop his rise to power.</i>

6
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:13,845
<i>Unfortunately,
my plan is opposed</i>

7
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:16,148
<i>by the body
I'd sworn my allegiance to:</i>

8
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:17,816
<i>The Time Masters.</i>

9
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:20,152
<i>In the future, my friends
may not be heroes,</i>

10
00:00:20,154 --> 00:00:21,787
<i>but if we succeed,</i>

11
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:24,656
<i>they will be remembered
as legends.</i>

12

<i>Previously

Ray!
Ray, I need you! Please!

14
00:00:31,298 --> 00:00:32,864
<i>I thought you were dead.</i>

15
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,666
Well, not only did you fail
to capture Savage.

16
00:00:34,668 --> 00:00:36,868
You also exposed yourselves
and your powers to him,

17
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,303
Giving away
the element of surprise

18
00:00:38,305 --> 00:00:39,771
For now and all time.

19
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:41,606
I let you go,
you'll deliver the Waverider.

20
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:43,308
Boys, ship's all yours.

<i>You're a liability
to the team.</i>

22

Yo, James Dean!

Are you...

44
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:02,587
What's that?

45
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:07,459
I think that's
a comet or something.

46
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:09,694
It's a meteorite,

47
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:11,797
In point of fact.

48
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:15,734
I was drawn to it as well.

49
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:19,771
Your presence out here
was unexpected.

50
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:23,542
Or perhaps that's just
another word for...

51
00:02:23,544 --> 00:02:26,878
Destiny.

52
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:40,258
I'm not the only one
whose vision is blurry

53
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,793
In their left eye, am I?

54
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:43,228
- Oh.
- Seeing three of everything?

55
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,329
That's normal, right?

56
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:45,831
Yes, as I mentioned before,

57
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,399
The effect of time travel
on the human body

58
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:49,501
Increases with the length
of each jaunt.

59
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:51,002
So where are we?

60
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,437
Harmony falls, Oregon.

61
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,272
According
to Captain Baxter's intel,

62
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:57,576
Savage makes an appearance
in this quaint little Hamlet.

63
00:02:57,578 --> 00:03:01,313
What the hell is Savage
doing in Pleasantville?

64
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:04,115
Murder, apparently.

65
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:05,517
Several denizens
of harmony falls

66
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,818
have been brutally slain,

67
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,320
and others have gone missing.

68
00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:10,422
Huh. Kind of like Rory.

69
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:12,023
Reports are vague,
but it seems like

70
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,159
the killer is an expert
with knives.

71
00:03:14,161 --> 00:03:16,127
That sounds like
Savage's MO.

72
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:17,762
Yeah, but
serial killing isn't.

73
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:19,164
Sounds pretty small-time
for a guy

74
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,832
who's has had coffee with Hitler.

75
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:22,434
Yeah, well, clearly we have
to assume that Savage

76
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:23,835
has a larger,
more nefarious plan.

77
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:25,337
But since we've
jumped back in time,

78
00:03:25,339 --> 00:03:27,372
Savage isn't expecting us here.

79
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:29,508
Savage is pretty good
at hiding,

80
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:30,876
even in a small town,

81
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:32,644
So how do you plan
to find him?

82
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:34,646
By investigating
these murders.

83
00:03:34,648 --> 00:03:36,681
Now, there has to be
a common link

84
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:38,149
between the victims,

85
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:40,385
Starting with the first.

86
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:43,021
<i>A piano teacher was found
slain in her home,</i>

87
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:44,456
<i>which is now on the market.</i>

88
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,625
There is, of course,
crown molding.

89
00:03:46,627 --> 00:03:48,560
All original floors.

90
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,228
Stucco ceiling.

91
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,497
There's a small room
above the garage,

92
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:54,666
suitable for live-in help.

93
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:57,035
Oh, well,
we don't need a maid.

94
00:03:57,037 --> 00:04:00,839
My husband and I get along
just fine on our own.

95
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:03,675
You know, I have
a lovely Tudor style

96
00:04:03,677 --> 00:04:05,176
in another town.

97
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:07,812
A more... accepting one.

98
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:10,482
Forward-thinking.

99
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:12,751
No, that's... that's fine.

100
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:16,421
I like my towns backward.

101
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,356
<i>Dr. Matt Miller
was found murdered</i>

102
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,325
<i>on the grounds of the asylum
where he worked.</i>

103
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:22,727
<i>The sanitarium is in need
of a replacement.</i>

104
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:26,264
It's a very
impressive facility.

105
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:29,100
I did my doctoral thesis
on socio-pathology

106
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,570
In relationship
to serial murder, actually.

107
00:04:31,572 --> 00:04:33,338
Well, that'll certainly
come in handy around here.

108
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,073
We've been short-staffed
ever since

109
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:37,542
Dr. Miller's sudden demise.

110
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:38,910
Of course,
I could never consider

111
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:40,378
Accepting a position here

112
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,782
Without my faithful
nurse/assistant.

113
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:45,283
Yes, well,

114
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,886
She looks like
she'll fit right in.

115
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,757
Meanwhile, Jefferson
is the perfect age

116
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,559
To discern the facts
behind the disappearance

117
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:56,561
Of three teenagers
who went missing

118
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:58,630
A week before
these murders began.

119
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,932
So Raymond and Kendra
are shacking up,

120
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:02,634
Sara's nurse ratched,

121
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,803
And Jax's the new kid in town.

122
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:07,639
Where does that leave me?

123
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,550
We're looking
for the sheriff.

124
00:05:18,552 --> 00:05:19,818
Well, you found him.

125
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,553
Bud Ellison.

126
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:23,455
How can I help you, folks?

127
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:25,323
Special agent Rip Hunter.

128
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,626
This is my partner, Leonard.

129
00:05:27,628 --> 00:05:30,428
We are here to investigate
the serial murders

130
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,298
Which have plagued this
sleepy old town of yours.

131
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,467
Whoa.
Now, slow down there, buddy.

132
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:38,169
There ain't
no serial killer anywhere.

133
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,338
All we got is some unexplained
accidents is all.

134
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,073
How about you hand over
those case files

135
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:44,743
So we can decide for ourselves?

136
00:05:44,745 --> 00:05:47,112
Or we can come back
with a court order

137
00:05:47,114 --> 00:05:50,382
And a really nasty disposition.

138
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:55,420
Anything for our friends
at the bureau.

139
00:05:58,591 --> 00:06:00,125
Nice work, partner.

140
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:02,193
You're not my partner.

141
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:05,930
There's only one person
I ever trusted on this job,

142
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:08,366
And we all know
how that turned out.

143
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,102
<i>['50s rock music playing]</i>

144
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:12,871
Schwinn hornets.

145
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:15,273
I had the very same one
when I was their age.

146
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:16,841
Seeing white picket fences

147
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:19,344
And perfect family houses,

148
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:21,479
It's enough
to make one nostalgic.

149
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:22,714
Or nauseated.

150
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,616
Oh, come on, Ms. Lance.

151
00:06:24,618 --> 00:06:26,117
Even someone as jaded
as yourself

152
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:29,487
can't deny how idyllic
this time was.

153
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:30,989
Yeah.

154
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:32,190
If you're white.

155
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:33,558
And a man.

156
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,326
And straight.
And...

157
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:37,062
Okay, okay.
I get the point.

158
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:38,496
Dude, even if this town

159
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:40,198
wasn't full
of small-minded idiots,

160
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,233
It'd still be creepy as hell.

161
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,636
I used to watch all these old
horror movies with my mom,

162
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:47,405
and they all started off
in places like this.

163
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,674
See, first it's all perfect,

164
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:51,676
and then, boom,
some alien monster beast thing

165
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:53,211
starts killing kids
on Lovers' lane.

166
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:55,780
- Ooh.
- I'm telling you, man.

167
00:06:58,217 --> 00:07:00,185
What is it?

168
00:07:00,187 --> 00:07:02,053
An unhappy cheerleader.

169
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:03,688
Now, that is scary.

170
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,523
That girl was from
the newspaper articles

171
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:06,725
Rip showed us.

172
00:07:06,727 --> 00:07:08,159
She knows the guys
that went missing.

173
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:09,661
Perhaps she can illuminate us

174
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:11,730
As to their whereabouts.

175
00:07:11,732 --> 00:07:13,565
Dude, can you not just say,

176
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:15,500
"hey, Jax, why don't you
go talk to her

177
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:16,868
And find out what she knows?"

178
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,169
Like a normal person.

179
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:19,370
Hey, Jax,

180
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:21,272
Why don't you just go do that?

181
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,208
All right. We mustn't dawdle.

182
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,710
I believe our lunch hour
is nearly at an end.

183
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:28,213
Come along, nurse.

184
00:07:28,215 --> 00:07:29,948
Just so you know,

185
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:33,017
Ra's Al Ghul taught me
how to kill someone slowly,

186
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:36,755
Over the course of days.

187
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:44,896
Hey, you mind if I sit?

188
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:46,531
You can't sit with him.

189
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:49,100
What is up with them?

190
00:07:50,035 --> 00:07:52,203
Um...

191
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:54,139
I-I don't think
they've seen anyone...

192
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:57,709
Dip their fries
in their milk shake before?

193
00:07:57,711 --> 00:07:59,311
Oh.

194
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,812
Mm-mm, don't knock it
till you tried it, girl.

195
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:03,114
No.

196
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:05,476
Okay.

197
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,289
- Okay, that's really good.
- Right?

198
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:12,590
Yeah.

199
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:15,260
- I'm Jax.
- Betty.

200
00:08:15,262 --> 00:08:16,961
Nice to meet you, Betty.

201
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:18,630
Hey, Betty.

202
00:08:18,632 --> 00:08:20,999
Just because your boyfriend
went AWOL

203
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:24,569
doesn't mean you have to slum it
with this loser.

204
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:27,105
Why don't you do yourself
a favor, Biff?

205
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:29,474
Keep walking before you really,

206
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:31,976
really embarrass yourself.

207
00:08:37,249 --> 00:08:39,884
What?
You want to take a swing at me?

208
00:08:42,621 --> 00:08:45,790
Hey. Let's go.

209
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:48,426
This isn't over.

210
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:52,130
I am so sorry about that.

211
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:55,633
- Uh, where were we?
- No, that was amazing.

212
00:08:59,638 --> 00:09:01,840
Do you want to hang out
tomorrow night?

213
00:09:01,842 --> 00:09:03,274
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

214
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:05,310
- It's a date.
- Okay.

215
00:09:07,314 --> 00:09:10,815
<i>♪ I was caught
by your kisses ♪</i>

216
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:12,717
Well, now that we're
done moving in,

217
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:15,186
Care to dance?

218
00:09:15,188 --> 00:09:16,855
Sure.

219
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:18,623
<i>♪ Locked in your arms ♪</i>

220
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,225
<i>♪ there's no mistake ♪</i>

221
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:22,827
So yesterday we kissed,

222
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:25,230
And now today we're married.

223
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:26,798
Okay, I know it seems like
we're moving fast,

224
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,199
But this is all pretend.

225
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:30,702
Soon as we get a divorce,

226
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:32,370
We'll figure us out.

227
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:34,539
In the meantime,

228
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,507
Doesn't mean we can't
have fun with it.

229
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,878
This is a waste of time.

230
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,346
We should be out there
looking for Savage,

231
00:09:41,348 --> 00:09:42,981
Not playing doctor.

232
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:44,082
You know what I mean.

233
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,250
I'd like to think

234
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:46,718
That in a town
with multiple murders

235
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,353
And missing teenagers,

236
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:49,988
The local insane asylum

237
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,856
Would be fertile ground
for clues.

238
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:53,358
Let's start
by reviewing the files

239
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,028
Of every inmate
with a history of violence.

240
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:01,900
If you wouldn't mind
getting me those files, nurse?

241
00:10:01,902 --> 00:10:05,203
Literally for days.

242
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:20,285
Is that a new perfume
I smell?

243
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,353
You know, if you're trying
to drive everyone crazy,

244
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:24,389
I have to tell you,
it's working.

245
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:25,723
I'm very busy right now.

246
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:27,191
You know what your problem is?

247
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:29,560
You don't know
how to have a good time.

248
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:30,862
Now, what you need

249
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:33,598
Is a man who can show you one.

250
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,768
Oops.

251
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:43,241
Thank you.

252
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:44,909
That was incredible.

253
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:46,044
Well, maybe next time,

254
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:48,379
He'll take no for an answer.

255
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:52,250
Uh, it's not just him.

256
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:54,619
Most of the doctors here
are looking for a good time,

257
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:56,654
And most of the nurses
all say yes,

258
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,723
'cause they're looking
to get married.

259
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:01,426
Oh. Not you, though.

260
00:11:01,428 --> 00:11:02,927
I'm...

261
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:06,397
Not really looking
for a husband.

262
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,333
Today's my first day.

263
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:11,502
Care to give
the new girl a tour?

264
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,108
The files you asked for,
doctor.

265
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,143
Excellent, nurse.

266
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:21,312
I could also go
for a cup of coffee.

267
00:11:21,314 --> 00:11:22,647
Me too.

268
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:25,850
Black. Two sugars.

269
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,753
And the cafeteria's
over there.

270
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:30,621
It's better than
what we serve the patients

271
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:31,689
But not by much.

272
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,791
- Mmm.
- Oh.

273
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:35,626
What's down there?

274
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:37,195
Oh, that's hall H,

275
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,030
The restricted ward.

276
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,999
It's for Dr. Knox's patients.

277
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:43,534
Violent psychotics.

278
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,704
That part of the tour
is worth skipping.

279
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:51,809
Coming!

280
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:54,345
I'm coming.

281
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:56,214
Welcome to the neighborhood.

282
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:57,215
Thank you.

283
00:11:57,217 --> 00:12:00,184
Thank you so much, Miss...

284
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:01,686
Mrs. Knox.

285
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:03,321
Gail Knox, and this

286
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:05,656
Is my husband, Curtis.

287
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:07,225
Lovely to meet you.

288
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:50,201
I'm sorry, have...

289
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:51,402
Have we met before?

290
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:52,904
I-I doubt it.

291
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:55,573
I... we just moved in

292
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:57,708
From way out of town.

293
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,370
I hope you like
tuna surprise.

294
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:01,179
Are you kidding?
I love tuna surpri...

295
00:13:01,181 --> 00:13:02,911
- Oh, my God...
- Raymond!

296
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:05,583
These are our new neighbors,

297
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:07,585
Curtis and Gail.

298
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:09,520
What a surprise.

299
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:12,123
Tuna surprise.
So many surprises.

300
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,125
Well, another reason
why we dropped by

301
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:16,527
was to let you know that we are
having a soiree tonight.

302
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:17,895
Stop by anytime after 8:00.

303
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:19,097
We're just across the street.

304
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:20,198
Don't bother to ring the bell.

305
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,967
No, you just walk right on in.

306
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:25,236
It's that kind of neighborhood.

307
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:27,472
Savage doesn't think
I recognize him,

308
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,474
which means he won't
try to kill me.

309
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:32,210
He can't steal my powers
before I've found them.

310
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:33,444
Don't forget, we also
have to figure out

311
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:34,745
why he's killing the townsfolk.

312
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:36,380
Are you really eating that?

313
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:37,882
Say what you want
about Savage.

314
00:13:37,884 --> 00:13:39,250
He makes one hell
of a casserole.

315
00:13:39,252 --> 00:13:40,551
Yes, well, Mr. Snart and I

316
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:43,154
have been analyzing
these forensic files.

317
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,989
Which reveal nothing except

318
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:46,624
Savage is very good

319
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:48,626
At making people disappear.

320
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:50,895
Hmm, something you both
have in common.

321
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:55,933
Are we just gonna pretend
like none of this happened?

322
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:58,436
That Mick Rory wasn't
a part of our team?

323
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:00,571
If you can just
ice your best friend like that,

324
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:02,173
I hate to think
what you could do to us.

325
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:04,675
Right now, we need to stay
focused on the mission.

326
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:05,776
Look, Savage is going
to be busy

327
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:07,945
With this little cocktail party.

328
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:09,447
Whilst you two
keep an eye on him,

329
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:10,848
Sara and Martin
have the opportunity

330
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,150
To find out what he's doing

331
00:14:12,152 --> 00:14:13,985
In the secret wing
of that asylum.

332
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,693
If you're looking for booze,

333
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,428
You're in the wrong office.

334
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,531
Dr. Knox doesn't drink.

335
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:31,202
But I know where Dr. Enbom
keeps the good stuff.

336
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:33,271
<i>♪ Bop-bop-bop,
bop-ba-dop-bop ♪</i>

337
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:36,040
<i>♪ it seems like
everyone's in love ♪</i>

338
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,209
<i>♪ everyone but me ♪</i>

339
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:40,611
<i>♪ I can't find a doggone soul ♪</i>

340
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:42,880
<i>♪ to share my company ♪</i>

341
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,382
Oh, there you are, dear.

342
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,051
I could go for
another glass of bubbly.

343
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:50,788
Then I suggest
you find a waitress.

344
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,156
Well, I-I just assumed...

345
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:53,958
You assume wrong.

346
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,895
So why don't you go ahead
and get your own champagne?

347
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,797
Wow, I guess this whole

348
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:02,967
Interracial marriage thing
really is a novelty.

349
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:05,203
Well, go ahead
and let them stare.

350
00:15:05,205 --> 00:15:07,338
I've got the most beautiful
woman in the room on my arm.

351
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,674
I couldn't agree
with you more.

352
00:15:09,676 --> 00:15:11,342
Oh, hello.

353
00:15:11,344 --> 00:15:12,877
Uh, thank you for inviting us.

354
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:15,746
Your home, is, um, very...

355
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,515
Normal.

356
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:20,718
Oh, we are just glad
that you could attend.

357
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,887
Let me fix you a drink.

358
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:26,891
Okay, we need to split up.

359
00:15:26,893 --> 00:15:28,192
You check the back rooms,

360
00:15:28,194 --> 00:15:30,194
And I'll see
what I can find up here.

361
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:32,163
Uh, you sure
that's a good idea?

362
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:33,531
Leaving you up here
by yourself

363
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:36,667
With Savage?

364
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:38,236
I'm pretty sure
he's not gonna kill me

365
00:15:38,238 --> 00:15:41,238
Next to the canapés, Ray.

366
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:42,441
Go.

367
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:43,774
I'll let you know
if I need help.

368
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:48,412
<i>♪ Fall in love with me ♪</i>

369
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,248
You've been so many places.

370
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,550
It's like you've had
three lives.

371
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:55,786
Me, I've never left
harmony falls.

372
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,555
That's your first mistake.

373
00:15:57,557 --> 00:15:59,023
This town sucks.

374
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:02,360
Wow, you do not hold back.

375
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:05,630
I've learned
life's too short.

376
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,965
So you have a girlfriend?

377
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,433
I just mean,

378
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:12,737
Seems pretty obvious
you're not into guys.

379
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:15,072
Uh, I, uh...

380
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:17,074
I don't know
what you're talking about.

381
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:19,043
Okay.

382
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:21,445
We don't have to talk about it
if you don't want to.

383
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:25,549
But just so you know,

384
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:28,119
I'm really good
at keeping secrets.

385
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,126
Funny you should say that.

386
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:37,128
I did

387
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:40,330
kiss a girl once.

388
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,600
I didn't think that made me a...

389
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:47,171
- You know.
- A lesbian?

390
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,306
What?

391
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:51,275
It's not a bad word.

392
00:16:51,277 --> 00:16:54,812
Well, it is around here.

393
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:59,717
Well, good thing I'm not
from around here.

394
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,821
Uh, nurse lance,

395
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:05,823
May I have
a word with you, please?

396
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:11,529
Well, now I see
what's been going on.

397
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:12,963
While I've been busy working,

398
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:14,865
You were busy
seducing that young woman.

399
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,935
Actually, I was
liberating her.

400
00:17:17,937 --> 00:17:19,303
With an option
to seduce her later.

401
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:20,471
Then what?

402
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:22,139
This poor young woman

403
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:24,709
Will have to remain in
the sexually repressive 1950s

404
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,444
Long after you've returned
to a timeship

405
00:17:26,446 --> 00:17:28,212
And disappeared
from her life forever.

406
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:29,380
You know what, doc?

407
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:30,681
I would love for someone

408
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:32,116
To drop into my life
and tell me

409
00:17:32,118 --> 00:17:34,385
That the future's gonna be
a better place.

410
00:17:36,456 --> 00:17:38,456
Get to hall H!

411
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:43,961
Your husband must be a fool

412
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:45,830
To leave a woman
such as yourself

413
00:17:45,832 --> 00:17:48,466
Alone at a party.

414
00:17:48,468 --> 00:17:51,135
He doesn't seem like your type.

415
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:52,970
That's a rather interesting
thing to say.

416
00:17:52,972 --> 00:17:56,507
You hardly know me.

417
00:17:56,509 --> 00:17:59,744
And yet I feel like I do.

418
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:03,214
Let me ask you
a question, Kendra.

419
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:05,750
Do you believe in past lives?

420
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:21,232
Do you believe in fate?

421
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:23,834
Fate is a prison.

422
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:27,405
When free will is gone,
what's left?

423
00:18:27,407 --> 00:18:29,907
Destiny.

424
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:32,843
Oh.

425
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,517
Hello.

426
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:40,951
Yeah. I understand.

427
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:44,755
Of course. I'm on my way.

428
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:47,625
Looks like we have to finish
our discussion later.

429
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:51,228
One of my patients
needs attention.

430
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:54,198
Enjoy the party.

431
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:12,283
Tommy, Tommy, Tommy.

432
00:19:12,285 --> 00:19:14,251
I-I thought the two of us

433
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:16,387
Had an understanding.

434
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:18,088
I've allowed
you and your cohorts

435
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,257
The occasional freedom
to run free

436
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:23,627
And to feed your thirst,
and then...

437
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:25,796
Then you do something like this.

438
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,010
I'm sorry, Mr. Palmer.

439
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,279
I'm unfamiliar with
the term "man cave".

440
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:43,647
Oh, it's a room
in a basement

441
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:44,849
Where a dude goes
to be alone

442
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:46,350
Or watch football.

443
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:48,519
In Savage's case,
it's kill people.

444
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,688
So Ray and I break in
and find out

445
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,690
What Savage is doing
in harmony falls.

446
00:19:55,293 --> 00:19:57,027
- Ho, ho, ho!
- Ooh.

447
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,929
Is tonight the
enchantment under the sea dance?

448
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:00,631
I got a date tonight

449
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:02,700
With Tommy Fuller's
cheerleader girlfriend.

450
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,168
Turns out Betty's boyfriend

451
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:06,036
Was one of the missing
high school kids.

452
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,838
I think she knows more
than she's letting on.

453
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,507
Mm, she's also a white girl

454
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:12,543
In a very, uh,
unenlightened community.

455
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,545
So please, be careful

456
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:15,946
When you're out
in public with her.

457
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:18,348
An immortal psychopath
and racists.

458
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:19,884
I'm beginning to like
this quaint little town

459
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:20,886
Less and less.

460
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:34,198
<i>How's it going over there?</i>

461
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,067
I'm in.

462
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,336
What do you see?

463
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:40,905
Uh...

464
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:43,407
Nothing all that hideous.

465
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:47,344
Except for a terrible collection
of golf pants.

466
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:49,747
Hang on.

467
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,256
Ray?

468
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,892
Ray, it's Savage. He's back.

469
00:21:01,894 --> 00:21:03,594
<i>Did you hear me, Ray?</i>

470
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:05,529
<i>You need to get out of there!</i>

471
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:07,164
I think I found something.

472
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:08,999
<i>No, no, no, no.
You don't have time.</i>

473
00:21:10,036 --> 00:21:11,535
<i>He's already inside.</i>

474
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:40,397
Don't you ever get
freaked out?

475
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:43,300
I mean, being in
an insane asylum

476
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,735
By yourself

477
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:46,437
In the middle of the night?

478
00:21:46,439 --> 00:21:49,306
Freaked out? No.

479
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,942
Lonely? Yes.

480
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:55,045
Actually, there is

481
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:58,215
One place in the hospital
that scares me.

482
00:21:58,217 --> 00:22:01,318
Dr. Knox's restricted wing.

483
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,655
Do you know what he's doing
to the patients down there?

484
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:05,990
No.

485
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:08,125
I don't like
to think about it.

486
00:22:08,127 --> 00:22:10,127
What do you like
to think about?

487
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,105
What's wrong?

488
00:22:21,107 --> 00:22:22,506
- Nothing.
- I thought you said...

489
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:24,742
I-I just...
I have to get back to work.

490
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:32,316
You look great tonight.

491
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:36,684
<i>♪ Don't have to tell me ♪</i>

492
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:39,449
Mm... whoa. Whoa.

493
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:42,018
- Uh...
- I'm sorry. I thought that...

494
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:43,458
No, don't be sorry.

495
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:44,928
It's just, uh,

496
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:46,697
I thought girls from 1958

497
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:49,166
moved a little bit slower.

498
00:22:49,168 --> 00:22:51,669
Girls from 1958?

499
00:22:51,671 --> 00:22:53,537
I mean, uh,

500
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:55,139
I think we should
get to know each other

501
00:22:55,141 --> 00:22:58,208
a little bit better first.

502
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,943
Okay.

503
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:01,612
What do you want to know?

504
00:23:01,614 --> 00:23:04,448
Those guys
back at the soda shop,

505
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:08,952
they mentioned something
about your boyfriend going AWOL?

506
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:10,154
Tommy.

507
00:23:10,156 --> 00:23:11,622
What happened to him?

508
00:23:11,624 --> 00:23:13,824
It's kind of a long story.

509
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:17,061
Well, I got
all the time in the world.

510
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:19,029
We were drag racing
down on route 7

511
00:23:19,031 --> 00:23:20,664
with Davis and Billy

512
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:23,000
when Tommy's car

513
00:23:23,002 --> 00:23:25,502
went into a ditch.

514
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:26,637
That's when they found it.

515
00:23:26,639 --> 00:23:28,205
Found what?

516
00:23:28,207 --> 00:23:29,540
This...

517
00:23:29,542 --> 00:23:31,508
Been looking all over for you.

518
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,576
- Get out!
- No!

519
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:33,878
Get out of the car!

520
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:36,879
Hey, get the hell
off me, man!

521
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:39,349
Stop it!
Stop it!

522
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:44,654
Ah!

523
00:23:44,657 --> 00:23:46,857
Get in! Get in!

524
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:48,659
Ah!

525
00:23:48,661 --> 00:23:51,762
Go!

526
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:55,733
Oh, come on!

527
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:01,105
Tommy?

528
00:24:08,414 --> 00:24:10,614
I am not playing anymore!

529
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:19,089
Don't worry, Betty.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

530
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:27,231
Nice driving.

531
00:24:27,233 --> 00:24:29,933
Hang in there.
Gideon's gonna fix you.

532
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:31,201
Who's Gideon?

533
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:33,604
Uh, a doctor, of sorts.

534
00:24:33,606 --> 00:24:34,605
Okay.

535
00:24:39,111 --> 00:24:42,579
You need to pull over, Jax.

536
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:49,386
Hey.

537
00:24:49,388 --> 00:24:51,455
Relax.

538
00:24:51,457 --> 00:24:52,823
Yeah, 'cause it's not like

539
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,391
I'm a black kid
in a small town

540
00:24:54,393 --> 00:24:56,560
With a white girl
bleeding all over my seat.

541
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:03,400
You were driving
to beat the devil back there.

542
00:25:03,402 --> 00:25:05,235
That explain why
your car looks like hell?

543
00:25:05,237 --> 00:25:07,404
I need to get my friend
to a hospital.

544
00:25:07,406 --> 00:25:08,906
- Friend?
- Yeah.

545
00:25:08,908 --> 00:25:10,407
And there's more wounded
on lovers' lane.

546
00:25:10,409 --> 00:25:12,009
Some... some kind of attack.

547
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:13,110
What were you doing
with this girl

548
00:25:13,112 --> 00:25:14,812
On lovers' lane, boy?

549
00:25:14,814 --> 00:25:16,780
There are kids back there
that could really use your help,

550
00:25:16,782 --> 00:25:18,849
And she needs medical attention
right now.

551
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:20,784
Put your hands on the car
and spread 'em.

552
00:25:20,786 --> 00:25:23,921
Listen, you can play boss hogg
all you want,

553
00:25:23,923 --> 00:25:25,956
But I'm not gonna let
that girl bleed to death,

554
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:27,958
So I tell you what:
I'm gonna get back in my car,

555
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,626
And I'm gonna take her
to the hospital.

556
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:48,045
Gideon traced Jax's
last biosignature

557
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:50,347
To this location.

558
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:56,787
Well, it seems
you had good reason

559
00:25:56,789 --> 00:25:58,822
To be concerned
for Mr. Jackson's safety.

560
00:25:58,824 --> 00:26:02,392
Yeah, sucks
being right all the time.

561
00:26:05,164 --> 00:26:07,531
<i>She has suffered
several severe lacerations.</i>

562
00:26:07,533 --> 00:26:09,399
<i>I am attempting
to cauterize the wound.</i>

563
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,834
- What happened?
- I don't know.

564
00:26:10,836 --> 00:26:12,536
But I'm guessing
Jax and Peggy Sue

565
00:26:12,538 --> 00:26:14,338
had a pretty lousy first date.

566
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,973
Where is Jefferson?

567
00:26:15,975 --> 00:26:18,408
There was no sign of him
in the car.

568
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,344
These wounds don't appear

569
00:26:20,346 --> 00:26:21,979
consistent with a knife.

570
00:26:21,981 --> 00:26:23,046
<i>Correct.</i>

571
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:24,248
<i>I believe these lacerations</i>

572
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,549
<i>were made by talons.</i>

573
00:26:25,551 --> 00:26:28,352
It was Tommy.

574
00:26:28,354 --> 00:26:30,187
Tommy Fuller,
one of the missing teenagers.

575
00:26:30,189 --> 00:26:31,421
He was like a bird.

576
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:34,858
He... he was like
a bird monster.

577
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,060
<i>Captain, analysis
of Miss Seaver's blood</i>

578
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:40,497
<i>reveals traces
of silicate minerals.</i>

579
00:26:40,499 --> 00:26:43,567
Miss Seaver, do you recall
Tommy coming into contact

580
00:26:43,569 --> 00:26:46,536
with a meteor of some kind?

581
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:48,672
The car crash...

582
00:26:48,674 --> 00:26:50,674
It was...

583
00:26:50,676 --> 00:26:52,175
It was glowing.

584
00:26:52,177 --> 00:26:54,211
She's talking about
an nth metal meteorite.

585
00:26:54,213 --> 00:26:56,413
Say something
that makes sense.

586
00:26:56,415 --> 00:26:58,415
It seems Mr. Fuller
has come into contact

587
00:26:58,417 --> 00:27:00,684
with a meteorite
with mutagenic properties.

588
00:27:00,686 --> 00:27:02,052
Try again.

589
00:27:02,054 --> 00:27:03,520
Apparently,
Miss Seaver's boyfriend

590
00:27:03,522 --> 00:27:05,455
has been exposed
to the same type of meteor

591
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:08,125
that Kendra
came into contact with.

592
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:09,293
Me?

593
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:11,695
Well, you and Carter.

594
00:27:11,697 --> 00:27:13,096
4,000 years ago.

595
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:15,432
The meteorite which
gave you your powers

596
00:27:15,434 --> 00:27:17,034
appears to be
of the same variety

597
00:27:17,036 --> 00:27:18,368
that mutated Tommy Fuller.

598
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,771
And I'm guessing
it's not curable.

599
00:27:20,773 --> 00:27:22,572
Well, I-I suppose,

600
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:24,441
if the talons
which lacerated her

601
00:27:24,443 --> 00:27:26,109
left some mutagenic residue,
I could...

602
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:27,978
Yes or no?

603
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,479
Perhaps.

604
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:33,216
Why don't you get
to work on that, Martin?

605
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:36,219
Okay, so if Savage isn't
the one doing the killing,

606
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:38,055
What is he doing in town?

607
00:27:38,057 --> 00:27:41,124
Doesn't matter.

608
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:42,592
We can take him down.

609
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:44,061
The Amon dagger.
Where did you...

610
00:27:44,063 --> 00:27:45,595
Savage's house.

611
00:27:45,597 --> 00:27:48,065
All right, we need
to proceed on two fronts:

612
00:27:48,067 --> 00:27:51,101
Locate Jefferson and make
an all-out assault on Savage.

613
00:27:51,103 --> 00:27:53,937
A full-on attack only plays
to Savage's strengths.

614
00:27:53,939 --> 00:27:55,138
If we want to get him...

615
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,441
We need to target
his weaknesses.

616
00:27:57,443 --> 00:28:00,644
Sadly, very few come to mind.

617
00:28:00,646 --> 00:28:02,846
I can think of one.

618
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:04,815
Me.

619
00:28:04,817 --> 00:28:07,284
He wants me, and he always has.

620
00:28:07,286 --> 00:28:09,753
So if I can get
close enough to him, then...

621
00:28:09,755 --> 00:28:11,521
Then he'll kill you.

622
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:14,191
Thank you for
the vote of confidence,

623
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:15,792
But I don't need
your protection.

624
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:17,928
There's no reason
to go alone.

625
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,863
We're part of a team
for a reason.

626
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:22,132
Yes, and the team
seems comfortable

627
00:28:22,134 --> 00:28:23,467
With me doing this,

628
00:28:23,469 --> 00:28:25,469
So that makes it
about you and me.

629
00:28:32,011 --> 00:28:34,311
- Any updates?
- We're making progress.

630
00:28:34,313 --> 00:28:36,813
In the meantime, we need
to get ready to back Kendra up.

631
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:39,516
She's going into the asylum
to meet Savage tonight.

632
00:28:39,518 --> 00:28:43,020
Another opportunity
for you to see nurse Carlisle.

633
00:28:43,022 --> 00:28:46,089
Yeah, and apologize.

634
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:49,226
I warned you, Ms. Lance.

635
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:51,862
Rushing a repressed woman
from the 1950s

636
00:28:51,864 --> 00:28:54,331
Into the freewheeling
sexual mores

637
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:55,665
Of the 21st century...

638
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:58,535
Actually, I was the one
who freaked out.

639
00:28:58,537 --> 00:28:59,803
Oh.

640
00:28:59,805 --> 00:29:02,506
Ever since I got
brought back to life,

641
00:29:02,508 --> 00:29:04,641
I haven't really...

642
00:29:04,643 --> 00:29:07,244
Experienced much
in the way of feelings.

643
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:10,580
And then when Lindsey
kissed me...

644
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,482
It was like
you were being kissed

645
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:14,918
For the first time.

646
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,219
How romantic.

647
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:18,889
It was more like terrifying.

648
00:29:18,891 --> 00:29:21,324
That's the thing
that sucks about feelings

649
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:23,260
Is, you realize how much

650
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:25,562
You can hurt someone

651
00:29:25,564 --> 00:29:29,099
Or... Get hurt.

652
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:31,268
- Ah.
- Wakey, wakey.

653
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:35,038
Ah.

654
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,339
Do the words "police brutality"

655
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:37,707
Mean anything to you?

656
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:39,109
You think this is brutal?

657
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:40,510
You'll be begging for me

658
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:42,712
After he gets through with you.

659
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:44,014
That's enough, sheriff.

660
00:29:44,016 --> 00:29:46,383
Thank you. Leave us be.

661
00:29:46,385 --> 00:29:48,618
This young man and I

662
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,754
Have a lot to discuss.

663
00:29:50,756 --> 00:29:53,590
Forgive my friend
for his ignorance.

664
00:29:53,592 --> 00:29:56,560
You will learn that
I'm much more enlightened.

665
00:29:56,562 --> 00:29:59,062
Well, I'll take racist
over crazy any day.

666
00:29:59,064 --> 00:30:00,897
Oh, I would hardly describe

667
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:04,367
what I'm doing here as...
as "crazy".

668
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:06,236
Therapy is nothing more

669
00:30:06,238 --> 00:30:08,572
Than a process
of self-discovery.

670
00:30:08,574 --> 00:30:13,210
You're about to experience
an extraterrestrial power.

671
00:30:13,212 --> 00:30:14,978
Shall we begin?

672
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:23,086
Shh, shh.

673
00:30:23,088 --> 00:30:24,621
Ah!

674
00:30:24,623 --> 00:30:26,156
Ah!

675
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,975
What a piece of work
is man.

676
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:48,745
When I was exposed
to a meteorite,

677
00:30:48,747 --> 00:30:51,615
I was blessed
with eternal life,

678
00:30:51,617 --> 00:30:53,450
Immortality.

679
00:30:53,452 --> 00:30:56,019
But sadly, the effect
of this meteorite

680
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:58,155
Turned out quite different.

681
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,625
But no less advantageous.

682
00:31:02,661 --> 00:31:04,761
Doc, you have a visitor.

683
00:31:21,146 --> 00:31:23,446
What a pleasant surprise.

684
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:25,615
Is it a surprise...

685
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:27,884
Or fate?

686
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:30,487
We didn't get to finish
our discussion the other night.

687
00:31:30,489 --> 00:31:34,291
What of your square-jawed
husband, Raymond?

688
00:31:34,293 --> 00:31:37,227
I didn't come here
to talk about my husband,

689
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:39,663
Doctor.

690
00:31:39,665 --> 00:31:42,866
May I?

691
00:31:42,868 --> 00:31:45,902
May I take your coat?

692
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:50,907
<i>Make yourself comfortable.</i>

693
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,342
Nurse?

694
00:31:52,344 --> 00:31:54,211
Nurse, I keep hearing
voices in my head.

695
00:31:54,213 --> 00:31:57,647
My wife with another man,

696
00:31:57,649 --> 00:31:59,082
And it's driving me crazy.

697
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:00,984
Well, maybe you should learn
to trust your wife

698
00:32:00,986 --> 00:32:02,819
A little bit more.

699
00:32:02,821 --> 00:32:04,354
Orderly?

700
00:32:04,356 --> 00:32:06,990
Show our new patient
to his room.

701
00:32:06,992 --> 00:32:08,725
And don't hesitate
to give him a sedative

702
00:32:08,727 --> 00:32:11,027
If he doesn't calm down.

703
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:13,630
Right away, nurse.

704
00:32:23,075 --> 00:32:25,041
I'm sure the kid is fine.

705
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:26,376
Jefferson and I,
as you know,

706
00:32:26,378 --> 00:32:27,611
Share a psychic connection,

707
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:30,046
But for some
inexplicable reason,

708
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:31,948
I can't seem to reach him.

709
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,718
I've grown so accustomed
to our partnership,

710
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,120
To suddenly be without him
is disquieting.

711
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:38,955
I know the feeling.

712
00:32:42,728 --> 00:32:46,062
So have you tried
psychoanalysis before?

713
00:32:46,064 --> 00:32:48,031
No.

714
00:32:48,033 --> 00:32:50,734
My husband thinks it's baloney.

715
00:32:50,736 --> 00:32:52,636
Oh, is that so?

716
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:54,537
Well, my specialty is

717
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:56,773
Interpreting dreams.

718
00:32:56,775 --> 00:32:58,441
What do you dream, Kendra?

719
00:32:58,443 --> 00:33:01,211
To be honest,

720
00:33:01,213 --> 00:33:03,613
I've dreamt of you before...

721
00:33:03,615 --> 00:33:06,416
And me...

722
00:33:06,418 --> 00:33:08,451
Together.

723
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:10,920
Well, that's interesting.

724
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:15,058
And what do we do
in those dreams?

725
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,826
I'm afraid
you'll think me forward.

726
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:19,429
Oh, but you are forward.

727
00:33:19,431 --> 00:33:22,465
Coming here in that dress?

728
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:25,068
Perhaps you should learn
to embrace your desires

729
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:28,605
So the two of us
can finally be together.

730
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,813
Did you lose something?

731
00:33:38,417 --> 00:33:39,783
I was wondering how long

732
00:33:39,785 --> 00:33:41,518
You could play out
this little charade.

733
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,519
Ah!

734
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:43,920
You show up on my doorstep,

735
00:33:43,922 --> 00:33:46,456
And then my dagger
goes missing?

736
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:49,125
You must think me stupid

737
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:52,128
Not to suspect
that your powers had emerged.

738
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:57,934
Well, well, well.

739
00:33:57,936 --> 00:34:01,171
An FBI agent moonlighting
at the loony bin.

740
00:34:01,173 --> 00:34:02,505
I'm afraid both of you boys

741
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:04,007
Have some explaining to do

742
00:34:04,009 --> 00:34:05,975
Down at the station.

743
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:08,511
Who else have you brought
to the asylum tonight?

744
00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:11,147
No one. No one!
It's just me.

745
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:12,649
I hope you're better at lying

746
00:34:12,651 --> 00:34:15,652
In your next life.

747
00:34:19,858 --> 00:34:21,324
Oh, boy.

748
00:34:21,326 --> 00:34:23,293
Just when you think
you've seen everything.

749
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:32,635
Guess those missing kids
are no longer missing.

750
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:36,072
What have you done?
Ah!

751
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,508
I released my test subjects.

752
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:41,745
The energy from the meteorite
has changed them.

753
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:45,682
I set out to build an army
as powerful as you.

754
00:34:45,684 --> 00:34:48,484
Pity they didn't turn out
nearly as beautiful.

755
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:02,732
Oh, my God.

756
00:35:02,734 --> 00:35:05,702
It's Jefferson.

757
00:35:05,704 --> 00:35:07,737
Jefferson, it's... it's us!

758
00:35:13,345 --> 00:35:16,105
Jax, don't make me do this.

759
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:32,662
Ah!

760
00:35:34,398 --> 00:35:35,598
I'll deal with this lot.

761
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,200
Find Kendra now.

762
00:36:02,092 --> 00:36:05,128
I can explain.
Just not now.

763
00:36:13,605 --> 00:36:15,138
Perhaps it will
turn out better

764
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:17,106
in our next life, my love.

765
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:23,146
Are you okay?

766
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:40,463
It's time to go.

767
00:36:40,465 --> 00:36:42,198
Not without Jefferson.

768
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,434
Or whatever's left of him.

769
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,540
Gideon was able
to help me devise

770
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:52,175
A gene therapy
that will hopefully

771
00:36:52,177 --> 00:36:53,943
Restore Jefferson
and those at the asylum

772
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:55,211
To their former selves.

773
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,880
If genome bonding occurs,

774
00:36:56,882 --> 00:36:58,648
We should know right away.

775
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:00,550
Course, we would never have had
the slightest chance

776
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:02,118
Of saving him
were it not for you.

777
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,786
Let's not get sentimental.

778
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:05,188
Another minute,
and things might have

779
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:07,357
Gone down very differently.

780
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:10,226
Despite your bravado,
Mr. Snart,

781
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,828
The actions that I witnessed
last night

782
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:14,063
Were nothing short of heroic.

783
00:37:22,541 --> 00:37:24,173
It's working.

784
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:32,882
Hey.

785
00:37:32,884 --> 00:37:35,051
How are our friends doing
over in hall H?

786
00:37:35,053 --> 00:37:36,920
Whatever Dr. Stein
gave those creatures

787
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:38,488
Seemed to have worked.

788
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:39,789
They're back to normal.

789
00:37:43,193 --> 00:37:45,228
And you?

790
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:49,432
Not sure if I'm ever
gonna get fully back to normal.

791
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:52,535
Good.

792
00:38:00,245 --> 00:38:01,945
Thank you...

793
00:38:01,947 --> 00:38:03,880
For rescuing me.

794
00:38:03,882 --> 00:38:05,214
Well, you rescued me first,

795
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:09,419
So now we're even.

796
00:38:09,421 --> 00:38:11,521
You have to go, don't you?

797
00:38:11,523 --> 00:38:14,357
I get it.

798
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:17,026
Should've known better
than to fall for a ninja.

799
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:24,634
Who knows?
Maybe I'll be back one day.

800
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:26,369
And if so...

801
00:38:26,371 --> 00:38:28,037
You know where to find me.

802
00:38:33,578 --> 00:38:36,112
So I felt bad
about trashing your dad's.

803
00:38:36,114 --> 00:38:38,748
I thought this might
make up for it.

804
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:39,882
You bought me a car?

805
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:41,217
I souped it up too.

806
00:38:41,219 --> 00:38:43,219
In case of future
monster attacks.

807
00:38:45,557 --> 00:38:48,057
I wish you didn't
have to go.

808
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:49,926
I don't belong here.

809
00:38:49,928 --> 00:38:51,794
And neither do you.

810
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:53,896
Promise me you'll
get out of this town.

811
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:55,932
The both of you.

812
00:38:55,934 --> 00:38:57,834
Tommy!

813
00:38:57,836 --> 00:38:59,669
It's a great big world
out there, Betty.

814
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:01,838
And it's changing fast.

815
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,974
Maybe we'll catch up
down the road somewhere.

816
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:13,750
Hey.
I was just packing up.

817
00:39:13,752 --> 00:39:15,351
I thought you were
back at the Waverider.

818
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:17,420
I just forgot something.

819
00:39:17,422 --> 00:39:19,689
I forgot to say I'm sorry.

820
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:21,991
Look, I was wrong
to think that I could

821
00:39:21,993 --> 00:39:23,660
Actually end Savage
by myself.

822
00:39:23,662 --> 00:39:26,596
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Just slow down.

823
00:39:26,598 --> 00:39:28,297
I made a mistake too.

824
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:29,932
I got so caught up
playing house

825
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:33,636
That I forgot about why
we were really here.

826
00:39:33,638 --> 00:39:37,106
And you will end Savage someday.

827
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:38,307
I guess the last thing

828
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:39,976
A 4,000-year-old
demigoddess needs

829
00:39:39,978 --> 00:39:42,879
Is an overprotective husband.

830
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:46,649
What she needs is a partner.

831
00:39:46,651 --> 00:39:49,185
What do you say?

832
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:53,556
Partner.

833
00:40:04,134 --> 00:40:06,169
Well, look
who's up and around.

834
00:40:06,171 --> 00:40:09,338
Mm, yeah.

835
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,808
I guess I owe you an apology.

836
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:14,977
Grey told me about what happened
back at the asylum.

837
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:18,147
You had the chance to kill me,
and you didn't.

838
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:20,483
After last night, I know enough
about being a monster

839
00:40:20,485 --> 00:40:21,818
To know that you're not one.

840
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:25,421
Stop.
I'm getting misty-eyed.

841
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,890
I just want you to know...

842
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:30,259
About what happened with Rory?

843
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:32,161
I get it.

844
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:33,730
You were protecting us.

845
00:40:33,732 --> 00:40:35,198
And that doesn't
make you a murderer.

846
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,866
It makes you
a part of this team.

847
00:40:36,868 --> 00:40:38,434
Jefferson,
you should be resting.

848
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,570
Aw, man, I'm...
I'm done laying around.

849
00:40:40,572 --> 00:40:42,038
I just want to get
the hell out of Mayberry.

850
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,273
Agreed... we're still
waiting on Sara

851
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,542
And the two lovebirds
to get back.

852
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:49,946
Seems they've taken
quite a shine to 1958.

853
00:40:51,583 --> 00:40:53,015
What on earth?

854
00:40:53,017 --> 00:40:55,117
Gideon?

855
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,886
Not this guy again.

856
00:40:56,888 --> 00:40:58,955
<i>Captain, Chronos has breached
the starboard hatch.</i>

857
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:00,257
How is that possible?

858
00:41:00,258 --> 00:41:01,658
Clearly, he's received
some new toys

859
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,620
from his Time Master friends
since our last encounter.

860
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:06,358
Gideon, seal the bulkheads
from here until...

861
00:41:13,705 --> 00:41:14,871
Grey, come on! Let's do this!

862
00:41:14,873 --> 00:41:16,305
If we merge on the Waverider,

863
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:17,740
we could destroy
the entire ship!

864
00:41:17,742 --> 00:41:18,975
Um, are you
not paying attention

865
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:21,310
To what Chronos is doing?

866
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:22,745
Fall back!

867
00:41:22,747 --> 00:41:24,380
Get to the jump ship!

868
00:41:29,087 --> 00:41:30,620
1958's swell and all,

869
00:41:30,622 --> 00:41:33,456
But I miss the internet...

870
00:41:33,458 --> 00:41:35,558
And cell phones.

871
00:41:38,228 --> 00:41:39,728
Uh...

872
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:42,298
What are they doing?

873
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,700
- Hey.
- Hey!

874
00:41:47,806 --> 00:41:50,506
Where did they go?

875
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,241
Better question:

876
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:54,310
Why did they leave us?

877
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:22,371
<i>Greg, move your head.</i>
