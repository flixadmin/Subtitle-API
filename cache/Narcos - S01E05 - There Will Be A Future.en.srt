1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074

2
00:00:20,989 --> 00:00:23,200
Beloved countrymen,

3
00:00:23,367 --> 00:00:26,828
the New Liberalism party
is the only force in Colombia

4
00:00:26,912 --> 00:00:29,373
that is not afraid of narcotraffickers.

5
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:32,876
"There are
three ways the narcotraffickers...

6
00:00:33,043 --> 00:00:37,089
- "try to weaken extradition."
- try to weaken extradition.

7
00:00:37,256 --> 00:00:38,549
- "Bribery..."
- Bribery...

8
00:00:38,632 --> 00:00:40,426
"intimidation through violence..."

9
00:00:40,509 --> 00:00:42,511
intimidation through violence...

10
00:00:42,595 --> 00:00:44,680
- "...and extortion."
- and extortion!

11
00:00:45,972 --> 00:00:50,018
- "A dark and terrible scourge."
- A dark and terrible scourge.

12
00:00:50,102 --> 00:00:52,145
What are you doing?

13
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:54,523
Just making sure he gets it right.

14
00:00:56,483 --> 00:00:59,445
You wrote it, you should know.

15
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:05,284
- Mm.
- Look, I brought you this.

16
00:01:05,367 --> 00:01:06,786
What's this?

17
00:01:06,868 --> 00:01:11,582
Clean socks.
Your wife dropped them off before we left.

18
00:01:13,793 --> 00:01:15,085
How's Galán doing?

19
00:01:16,336 --> 00:01:18,547
All right.

20
00:01:18,631 --> 00:01:22,134
I wish he didn't focus so much
on extradition of narcos.

21
00:01:22,217 --> 00:01:25,011
There are other things to mention.

22
00:01:26,138 --> 00:01:27,765
Galán's got some balls.

23
00:01:27,931 --> 00:01:32,436
Brave men have a way of dying quickly.

24
00:01:32,603 --> 00:01:38,400
Well, then, you don't have to worry...
do you?

25
00:01:41,403 --> 00:01:42,780
Aah...

26
00:01:43,697 --> 00:01:44,990
Pass me the socks.

27
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:20,544
First thing
is that we get you out of Bogotá.

28
00:03:20,627 --> 00:03:23,046
- OK.
- There's an orphanage in Cumaral.

29
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:26,216
It's out of the guerrilla zone
and away from the narcos.

30
00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:27,634
And then what?

31
00:03:28,802 --> 00:03:30,136
We get you a passport.

32
00:03:32,013 --> 00:03:34,975
From another country, we can depose you
about Escobar and the siege.

33
00:03:36,184 --> 00:03:39,772
You may have run away from your country,
but I'm not running away from mine.

34
00:03:52,993 --> 00:03:55,036
This is about keeping you alive.

35
00:03:57,581 --> 00:03:59,833
Do you sleep with all your informants?

36
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:04,755
I'm not your responsibility.

37
00:04:09,342 --> 00:04:13,305
If Pablo Escobar finds you...
he'll kill you in a heartbeat.

38
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,310
Not if I kill him first.

39
00:04:22,314 --> 00:04:24,232
Yeah, she's a live hand grenade.

40
00:04:24,316 --> 00:04:27,360
She's the only witness we got that
can tie Escobar to the palace massacre.

41
00:04:27,444 --> 00:04:29,863
Hard to bring her in when
she gets turned over to the Colombians

42
00:04:29,947 --> 00:04:32,365
and she gets disappeared.
Are you ready for that?

43
00:04:32,449 --> 00:04:33,659
No.

44
00:04:33,742 --> 00:04:35,535
So what's our options,
since we have none?

45
00:04:35,619 --> 00:04:37,496
Well, we keep her in hiding
until things cool down,

46
00:04:37,579 --> 00:04:39,498
and get her immunity
in exchange for her testimony...

47
00:04:39,581 --> 00:04:41,875
Are you gonna get us immunity?

48
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:44,461
We are going to jail
if we get caught with this woman.

49
00:04:44,544 --> 00:04:47,380
Well, the next time your wife decides
to bring home a human hand grenade,

50
00:04:47,464 --> 00:04:49,257
how about she hands it to you?

51
00:04:51,802 --> 00:04:53,762
Are you fucking her?

52
00:04:55,014 --> 00:04:56,598
Sleep with a communist?

53
00:04:57,599 --> 00:04:59,643
That would be downright un-American.

54
00:05:03,981 --> 00:05:06,232
Any intel to support the DEA theory

55
00:05:06,316 --> 00:05:09,361
that Escobar is behind
the Palace of Justice siege?

56
00:05:09,444 --> 00:05:10,904
No, ma'am.

57
00:05:10,988 --> 00:05:13,949
Agent Peña claims to have an informant
that can testify to that effect,

58
00:05:14,115 --> 00:05:15,784
but he hasn't brought him forward.

59
00:05:15,868 --> 00:05:18,161
In my book,
there's only two of them that know that.

60
00:05:19,329 --> 00:05:22,624
And one of them is Elisa Alvaro,
girlfriend of Alejandro Ayala.

61
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:25,878
The other one is Ernesto Sobrino,

62
00:05:25,961 --> 00:05:31,174
a radical priest who gave shelter
to M-19 fugitives in Los Altos comuna.

63
00:05:31,341 --> 00:05:33,510
Is one of these people your informant?

64
00:05:33,677 --> 00:05:37,806
Ambassador, this is...
unofficial wiretap information.

65
00:05:38,849 --> 00:05:41,184
We, uh, intercepted
a discussion between narcos.

66
00:05:41,351 --> 00:05:43,854
What? Which narcos?

67
00:05:44,938 --> 00:05:47,524
- Sounded like Pablo Escobar.
- We're almost certain.

68
00:05:47,691 --> 00:05:49,985
It was, uh...
It was hard to tell.

69
00:05:50,069 --> 00:05:52,445
The... connection was bad.
They were calling from Panama.

70
00:05:52,612 --> 00:05:54,364
- Panama?
- They know Galán's gonna win

71
00:05:54,447 --> 00:05:56,408
and they know
that he'll support extradition,

72
00:05:56,491 --> 00:05:59,327
and they're not gonna sit around
and await being sent back to the US.

73
00:05:59,494 --> 00:06:02,873
Ambassador, word is Manuel Noriega
is providing safe harbor for the narcos,

74
00:06:02,956 --> 00:06:05,667
and possibly shipping points
for their cocaine.

75
00:06:05,751 --> 00:06:07,920
They're moving
their drug operations to Panama?

76
00:06:08,003 --> 00:06:10,547
That's horseshit, Peña.
Excuse me, Ambassador.

77
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:14,467
On one hand, you're saying Escobar's
in bed with left-wing communists.

78
00:06:14,551 --> 00:06:16,762
Now you're saying
he's in bed with Manuel Noriega.

79
00:06:17,596 --> 00:06:19,347
You can't have it both ways, son.

80
00:06:19,431 --> 00:06:24,061
Ambassador, Manuel Noriega has helped us
fight communism all over Latin America

81
00:06:24,144 --> 00:06:25,311
for the last two decades.

82
00:06:25,478 --> 00:06:29,733
I take great offense at any attempt
by the DEA to smear his good name.

83
00:06:30,316 --> 00:06:33,112
I couldn't help but laugh.

84
00:06:33,278 --> 00:06:35,196
Right wing, left wing...

85
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,742
For Manuel Noriega,
it was all about the money.

86
00:06:39,659 --> 00:06:43,371
When Bush was head of the CIA,
Noriega pretended to be a commie hater

87
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:48,376
so the US would ignore the fact that he
was heavily involved as a drug trafficker.

88
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:52,213
When Noriega realized he could
make even more money shipping his drugs

89
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:55,759
by siding with communists,
he switched teams.

90
00:06:55,842 --> 00:06:59,930
So, we invaded Panama,
and arrested "Old Pineapple Face."

91
00:07:00,931 --> 00:07:02,599
But, that was later.

92
00:07:02,682 --> 00:07:06,770
For now, the trusted friend and ally
was a right-wing CIA asset

93
00:07:06,853 --> 00:07:10,190
who was taking money from Bush...
and right from the narcos.

94
00:07:15,487 --> 00:07:19,908
Pablo had knocked off half the Colombian
Supreme Court to fight extradition.

95
00:07:19,992 --> 00:07:22,828
And now, he was offering
to pay off Colombia's national debt

96
00:07:22,911 --> 00:07:24,121
in exchange for a truce.

97
00:07:25,497 --> 00:07:27,082
Guess he missed home.

98
00:07:43,932 --> 00:07:47,602
Look at this
shit. We are spending millions of dollars,

99
00:07:47,686 --> 00:07:51,982
and can't even get a decent meal anywhere.

100
00:07:52,065 --> 00:07:57,612
Listen, the problem isn't the food,
the problem is Noriega.

101
00:07:57,737 --> 00:08:01,158
First chance he gets,
he'll sell us to the Americans.

102
00:08:01,241 --> 00:08:02,575
You guys stay calm.

103
00:08:02,659 --> 00:08:05,662
Once we reach an agreement with the
government, we'll be back in our homeland.

104
00:08:05,871 --> 00:08:10,500
Pay the Colombian
national debt for amnesty?

105
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:13,545
I'd rather go live in Spain.

106
00:08:13,628 --> 00:08:18,091
I say we go back and fight.

107
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:21,344
No, sir, none of that.
War is bad for business.

108
00:08:21,427 --> 00:08:23,722
We will negotiate with them
as Pablo agreed.

109
00:08:28,476 --> 00:08:32,480
Look, Gustavo,
none of this would've happened

110
00:08:32,564 --> 00:08:34,607
if he hadn't started
killing politicians and judges.

111
00:08:34,691 --> 00:08:37,027
Tell me what we are supposed to do, then.

112
00:08:37,194 --> 00:08:40,280
Do you want to sit here
and cry over spilled milk?

113
00:08:40,947 --> 00:08:42,074
You know something, Pablo?

114
00:08:44,284 --> 00:08:48,413
Sometimes, I think you kill these men
because they won't let you in their club.

115
00:08:48,621 --> 00:08:51,332
You better watch your mouth, asshole.

116
00:09:09,475 --> 00:09:13,730
The Colombian government
has refused our amnesty offer.

117
00:09:15,398 --> 00:09:18,068
Get used to the food, gentlemen.

118
00:09:20,195 --> 00:09:22,030
It's not safe to go back home.

119
00:09:45,553 --> 00:09:48,056
They've rejected our amnesty deal.

120
00:09:51,392 --> 00:09:53,270
We may have to stay.

121
00:09:57,816 --> 00:09:59,484
I hate this place.

122
00:10:02,612 --> 00:10:04,781
We can go someplace else.

123
00:10:04,864 --> 00:10:08,285
I hear Switzerland is very beautiful.

124
00:10:08,368 --> 00:10:10,703
In Switzerland,
we are nobody, Pablo.

125
00:10:11,788 --> 00:10:15,208
What good is having all the money
in the world if you can't go home?

126
00:10:23,008 --> 00:10:27,262
If we go back...
I'm going to have to fight.

127
00:10:35,395 --> 00:10:37,981
Do whatever is necessary,
my love.

128
00:10:49,826 --> 00:10:51,786
So, there it was.

129
00:10:52,704 --> 00:10:55,165
The decision that would
change Colombia forever.

130
00:11:00,295 --> 00:11:02,505
You're way ahead in the polls.

131
00:11:03,631 --> 00:11:06,676
In my opinion,
the outcome is decided.

132
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:10,013
My question is... why do you
keep getting involved with the narcos?

133
00:11:11,264 --> 00:11:13,141
I want a country at peace.

134
00:11:14,184 --> 00:11:15,935
And if I don't do it, who will?

135
00:11:16,811 --> 00:11:18,438
You're backing them into a corner.

136
00:11:19,814 --> 00:11:21,733
I'm wearing a vest.

137
00:11:22,734 --> 00:11:24,861
I'm afraid that a bulletproof vest...

138
00:11:24,944 --> 00:11:28,365
isn't enough to ensure
that you have a future.

139
00:11:30,616 --> 00:11:34,079
Don't worry, my friend.
There will be a future.

140
00:11:46,299 --> 00:11:51,012
Luis Carlos Galán
took the stage in Soacha on August 18th,

141
00:11:51,096 --> 00:11:54,849
against the advice
of his campaign manager, César Gaviria.

142
00:12:02,607 --> 00:12:06,819
The bullets entered just below
his vest and he was dead within minutes.

143
00:12:06,903 --> 00:12:09,906
For a brief shining moment,
there was hope...

144
00:12:10,865 --> 00:12:13,493
extinguished by the pull
of an assassin's trigger.

145
00:12:15,495 --> 00:12:20,959
To mourn Galán's death, every hut in the
countryside lit a candle in remembrance...

146
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:26,089
and in the cities, thousands took
to the streets in a march of the silent,

147
00:12:26,256 --> 00:12:29,675
a mute protest
against the violence of the narcos.

148
00:12:31,344 --> 00:12:35,807
With Galán's murder... came the end
of hope for a peaceful future.

149
00:12:40,603 --> 00:12:42,481
Let's speak clearly, brother.

150
00:12:45,733 --> 00:12:47,402
Galán's dead.

151
00:12:48,236 --> 00:12:50,113
You had him killed, didn't you?

152
00:12:51,156 --> 00:12:53,492
You didn't tell us shit,
and you killed him, you son of a bitch.

153
00:12:53,574 --> 00:12:56,286
- I want to go home, Fabio.
- Home?

154
00:12:56,453 --> 00:12:58,913
Why are we going home?
So they can capture us?

155
00:13:00,748 --> 00:13:05,170
All this shit you talk about partnership,
and then you do this on your own? Huh?

156
00:13:11,217 --> 00:13:13,970
Galán was the only threat.

157
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,765
There is no one left to challenge us.

158
00:13:17,849 --> 00:13:19,309
And you know why, Fabio.

159
00:13:20,268 --> 00:13:23,313
Because no one
has the balls that we have.

160
00:13:25,982 --> 00:13:28,234
Going home.

161
00:13:32,197 --> 00:13:33,990
Pablo was right.

162
00:13:34,073 --> 00:13:36,742
Who would have the balls
to fill Galán's shoes?

163
00:13:39,704 --> 00:13:42,248
That unique honesty.

164
00:13:42,457 --> 00:13:45,418
As the people now rise
and call for justice,

165
00:13:45,626 --> 00:13:49,506
I pray to God
that this sacrifice will serve at last...

166
00:13:50,923 --> 00:13:55,470
as motivation for society
to react and bond...

167
00:13:55,554 --> 00:14:00,892
to support the government...
and institutions...

168
00:14:00,975 --> 00:14:05,646
while also demanding
a more effective leadership,

169
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:09,734
one undeterred by the hitmen,
the hijackings,

170
00:14:09,817 --> 00:14:13,363
or any other manifestations of violence.

171
00:14:13,446 --> 00:14:16,533
My father, Luis Carlos Galán,

172
00:14:16,616 --> 00:14:18,868
will be remembered
for awakening the Colombian people

173
00:14:18,951 --> 00:14:22,080
to the danger of the narcos.

174
00:14:23,998 --> 00:14:28,294
The assassin's bullets...
will not stop what my father began.

175
00:14:29,254 --> 00:14:33,383
As he fell,
another rises in his place.

176
00:14:33,592 --> 00:14:37,345
I want to tell Dr. César Gaviria...

177
00:14:38,471 --> 00:14:41,433
in the name of the people of Colombia,
and my family...

178
00:14:42,392 --> 00:14:47,146
that we entrust my father's ideals to him,
and that he can count on our support...

179
00:14:47,355 --> 00:14:51,401
to become the president
Colombia wants and needs.

180
00:14:54,362 --> 00:14:57,907
Dr. César Gaviria, save Colombia!

181
00:14:59,992 --> 00:15:03,329
Gaviria! Gaviria! Gaviria!

182
00:15:09,586 --> 00:15:14,549
Dr. César Gaviria...
the new hope of Colombia.

183
00:15:14,757 --> 00:15:18,637
If he took Galán's position on
extradition, the narcos would declare war.

184
00:15:18,803 --> 00:15:22,515
If he didn't,
the country would become a narco state.

185
00:15:31,524 --> 00:15:32,900
Phone!

186
00:15:34,777 --> 00:15:37,196
Let it go to the answering machine.

187
00:15:40,866 --> 00:15:45,288
The machine's full.

188
00:15:45,371 --> 00:15:47,540
I wish it would stop ringing.

189
00:15:47,624 --> 00:15:51,085
It's your friends.
They're calling to offer support.

190
00:15:52,795 --> 00:15:56,174
Or opinions about what I should do.

191
00:15:58,176 --> 00:16:00,595
Why can't you run
without backing extradition?

192
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,728
- I wrote those speeches.
- Yes...

193
00:16:09,979 --> 00:16:11,481
but do you even believe in them?

194
00:16:15,151 --> 00:16:17,069
I don't know what I believe.

195
00:16:18,738 --> 00:16:21,491
I don't want the narcos having free reign.

196
00:16:23,284 --> 00:16:26,705
But I don't want the United States
involved in our affairs.

197
00:16:27,747 --> 00:16:29,499
So say nothing.

198
00:16:31,334 --> 00:16:33,628
That's the best way to stay alive.

199
00:16:50,019 --> 00:16:51,145
Gentlemen.

200
00:16:51,979 --> 00:16:55,567
Fernando, cheer up. Have a drink.

201
00:16:55,734 --> 00:16:57,527
We're going home!

202
00:17:02,365 --> 00:17:04,867
- How are you? Hm?
- Fine, my love.

203
00:17:06,786 --> 00:17:08,371
What about you?

204
00:17:08,454 --> 00:17:09,497
Give me one.

205
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,000
Margarita, right?

206
00:17:13,876 --> 00:17:15,044
Let's see.

207
00:17:17,213 --> 00:17:19,215
- Son of a bitch, that's good.
- Right?

208
00:17:19,298 --> 00:17:23,094
Thank you.
Listen, I've got a question for you.

209
00:17:23,177 --> 00:17:25,388
Why are we going back?

210
00:17:26,305 --> 00:17:28,767
We're walking into a world of shit.

211
00:17:28,849 --> 00:17:31,977
Relax, brother.

212
00:17:32,061 --> 00:17:36,566
Spain's too far away
to protect our interests.

213
00:17:36,649 --> 00:17:40,152
We have a better chance
of influencing Pablo at home.

214
00:17:40,236 --> 00:17:45,533
We need to be close by. Relax.

215
00:17:45,617 --> 00:17:47,744
Don't you get it?

216
00:17:49,579 --> 00:17:52,998
He's only comfortable at war.

217
00:17:53,207 --> 00:17:55,501
He's taking us to the slaughter.

218
00:18:23,738 --> 00:18:25,197
How's business?

219
00:18:25,281 --> 00:18:30,829
Fucking Noriega is charging us a fortune,
but we got 175 tons to Miami.

220
00:18:31,621 --> 00:18:35,207
Gacha's Mexican routes
are opening up Los Angeles.

221
00:18:36,709 --> 00:18:39,838
But do you know what matters most
for our business, Pablo?

222
00:18:41,005 --> 00:18:44,759
That the situation at home stays calm.
Know what I mean?

223
00:18:44,843 --> 00:18:46,093
Sure.

224
00:19:00,941 --> 00:19:03,653
You should have
consulted with me about Galán.

225
00:19:04,863 --> 00:19:07,866
You would have tried to talk me out of it.

226
00:19:07,948 --> 00:19:09,325
Yes.

227
00:19:11,661 --> 00:19:12,995
I would have tried.

228
00:19:15,581 --> 00:19:18,710
The amount of money we are losing
is because of that bullshit.

229
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,715
Are you listening?

230
00:19:24,924 --> 00:19:26,967
Look at those peaks, Gustavo.

231
00:19:32,932 --> 00:19:36,936
I'll die...
before I ever leave Colombia again.

232
00:19:44,485 --> 00:19:46,070
What's happening, Carrillo?

233
00:19:46,153 --> 00:19:47,446
Thank you for coming.

234
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:49,198
I understand the narcos
are back from Panama.

235
00:19:49,281 --> 00:19:51,075
So you practice your English with me?

236
00:19:51,158 --> 00:19:53,661
Because these men
aren't cleared, and if we speak Spanish,

237
00:19:53,745 --> 00:19:55,162
it could get back to Pablo.

238
00:19:56,997 --> 00:19:59,959
So I started this to monitor
Pablo's sicarios' communications.

239
00:20:00,042 --> 00:20:02,628
SAT phones, landlines, you name it.

240
00:20:02,712 --> 00:20:04,046
I've got dozens of wiretaps,

241
00:20:04,129 --> 00:20:07,091
but I've only managed to seize
about ten kilos in the last month.

242
00:20:07,174 --> 00:20:10,302
Probably because I've listened
to my own men tipping the narcos off.

243
00:20:10,386 --> 00:20:11,804
So I've had to start surveilling them.

244
00:20:12,722 --> 00:20:15,349
I listen to them
tell their girlfriends they're afraid...

245
00:20:15,433 --> 00:20:18,018
cry to their mothers
when one of our men gets shot down.

246
00:20:19,353 --> 00:20:22,440
But every once in a while...
I hear them trade secrets with Pablo.

247
00:20:23,733 --> 00:20:25,818
Do your bosses know you're doing this?

248
00:20:26,611 --> 00:20:28,112
I trust them even less.

249
00:20:28,988 --> 00:20:30,740
Most of my men are from here,

250
00:20:30,823 --> 00:20:34,118
where they can get to your mother,
your aunt, your cousin.

251
00:20:34,911 --> 00:20:39,582
How do I fight... when my soldiers
are already working for Escobar?

252
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:43,127
Well, do they have to be from Medellín?

253
00:20:51,093 --> 00:20:52,511
Yes.

254
00:20:52,595 --> 00:20:54,680
I definitely like the red one best.

255
00:20:55,514 --> 00:20:57,934
- Really?
- Mm.

256
00:20:58,017 --> 00:20:59,435
I prefer the gray.

257
00:21:00,394 --> 00:21:03,188
Red is the color of the party,

258
00:21:03,272 --> 00:21:07,067
and it makes you more...
sociable and close to the people.

259
00:21:07,151 --> 00:21:10,237
- That's important.
- Mm.

260
00:21:12,114 --> 00:21:14,575
I wonder what Luis Carlos
would have chosen?

261
00:21:16,285 --> 00:21:19,497
You know, we should
also hire an image consultant.

262
00:21:20,414 --> 00:21:26,295
We have to make you more appealing
to the youth, give you a more modern look.

263
00:21:26,462 --> 00:21:28,380
Now you are going to give me image advice?

264
00:21:28,464 --> 00:21:30,299
I'm just thinking about the polls.

265
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:33,302
Anyway...

266
00:21:35,262 --> 00:21:40,142
Galán had professionals at his side,
but which could he trust?

267
00:21:40,225 --> 00:21:42,020
Hm?

268
00:21:42,102 --> 00:21:45,481
And you know perfectly well
that you can trust me, right?

269
00:21:45,564 --> 00:21:47,025
Mm-hm.

270
00:21:48,943 --> 00:21:51,821
Well, what are you going to choose,
red or gray?

271
00:22:00,538 --> 00:22:03,374
Luis Carlos said something to me
before he died.

272
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,752
"There will be a future."

273
00:22:10,255 --> 00:22:12,466
Now let's see what kind of future it is.

274
00:22:19,098 --> 00:22:21,141
We worked together in the ministry.

275
00:22:21,308 --> 00:22:23,644
The idea that
he's a presidential candidate

276
00:22:23,728 --> 00:22:26,022
shows you our sad state of affairs.

277
00:22:27,439 --> 00:22:29,608
I need to know which side he is on.

278
00:22:30,818 --> 00:22:33,738
He speaks with
the Foreign Press next week.

279
00:22:33,821 --> 00:22:35,781
They'll certainly ask his position.

280
00:22:35,865 --> 00:22:38,576
Don't worry, Pablo.
He'll be easy to influence.

281
00:22:38,659 --> 00:22:40,078
- No, I disagree.
- Why?

282
00:22:40,285 --> 00:22:43,956
I did an interview with him once,
when he was an economic advisor.

283
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:47,543
I found him sitting in the parking lot
in his beat-up Renault,

284
00:22:47,626 --> 00:22:53,091
eating a bag of apples...
and reading economic reform textbooks.

285
00:22:53,298 --> 00:22:55,968
He was testifying to the cabinet
and wanted to be ready.

286
00:22:56,052 --> 00:22:59,388
He's a bookworm, not a leader.

287
00:22:59,471 --> 00:23:01,766
- No... No...
- No, no, no, you're missing my point.

288
00:23:01,849 --> 00:23:03,809
- No.
- He's not an oligarch.

289
00:23:05,019 --> 00:23:06,896
He's from modest circumstances.

290
00:23:06,979 --> 00:23:08,898
Like you,
he's worked for everything he has.

291
00:23:10,066 --> 00:23:12,359
You have to be careful
with people like that.

292
00:23:21,619 --> 00:23:23,788
I want you to deliver a message.

293
00:23:25,164 --> 00:23:27,249
We've made a lot of money.

294
00:23:27,332 --> 00:23:32,797
What we have to decide is do we stick
with Pablo... or chart our own course?

295
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,094
We should talk to our friends down south.

296
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:42,765
No, no. It's not time. No. Mm?

297
00:23:42,974 --> 00:23:45,643
Whatever you say.

298
00:23:45,726 --> 00:23:47,311
Have you seen Marina?

299
00:23:47,394 --> 00:23:48,980
She told me she was
going to buy a new brush.

300
00:23:49,063 --> 00:23:51,816
You know your sister.

301
00:23:51,899 --> 00:23:56,195
Her shopping expeditions take weeks.

302
00:24:02,618 --> 00:24:04,954
You have no idea how much
I wanted to go down on you in Panama.

303
00:24:05,037 --> 00:24:06,371
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

304
00:24:06,455 --> 00:24:09,875
I could tell that you really wanted to.

305
00:24:09,959 --> 00:24:12,461
- Come here, baby.
- You are very patient.

306
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,838
Yes, of course.

307
00:24:14,797 --> 00:24:17,800
All your people were there,
your brothers...

308
00:24:26,266 --> 00:24:29,020
My brothers are driving me crazy.

309
00:24:31,981 --> 00:24:33,107
- You know what?
- What?

310
00:24:33,191 --> 00:24:35,651
They can go fuck themselves.

311
00:24:35,776 --> 00:24:38,070
If they want to,
they can go live in Spain...

312
00:24:38,154 --> 00:24:40,990
but you're staying here with me.

313
00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:50,208
Let's not hide anymore.

314
00:24:50,833 --> 00:24:53,252
Not anymore.

315
00:24:54,294 --> 00:24:55,546
All right.

316
00:24:57,548 --> 00:25:00,092
What do we do about my wife?

317
00:25:03,512 --> 00:25:05,305
Ask Pablo to do us a favor.

318
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,977
Just like he took care of Galán,
he can take care of your wife.

319
00:25:18,277 --> 00:25:19,737
You...

320
00:25:20,571 --> 00:25:23,282
are very evil for such a young girl.

321
00:25:28,162 --> 00:25:30,706
You've moved up, Fernando.

322
00:25:32,332 --> 00:25:37,755
From government minister
to Pablo Escobar's errand boy.

323
00:25:39,381 --> 00:25:41,884
I guess the pay is much better.

324
00:25:42,676 --> 00:25:44,553
I'm not doing this for the money.

325
00:25:45,512 --> 00:25:50,184
What country sends its own citizens
to an iron tomb in the United States?

326
00:25:51,102 --> 00:25:52,770
I understand your dilemma.

327
00:25:52,853 --> 00:25:58,734
Speak out in favor, you're seen as a US
puppet and you might not win the election.

328
00:25:59,777 --> 00:26:03,239
Speak out against,
you anger the US...

329
00:26:04,282 --> 00:26:07,285
and are criticized by our media
as a shill of the narcos.

330
00:26:07,367 --> 00:26:10,871
César, I was thinking I would love
to dedicate a program for your campaign.

331
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:14,792
It would be an honor for me,
and would benefit us both.

332
00:26:16,835 --> 00:26:18,254
What a great idea.

333
00:26:19,088 --> 00:26:21,757
You guys are really shameless,
aren't you?

334
00:26:22,925 --> 00:26:26,720
- How do you sleep at night?
- César, it doesn't have to be this way.

335
00:26:26,887 --> 00:26:30,641
If Luis had been as smart as you,

336
00:26:30,724 --> 00:26:32,851
perhaps we could have avoided
this horrible tragedy.

337
00:26:35,437 --> 00:26:36,772
We could have had peace.

338
00:26:36,939 --> 00:26:38,190
Easy.

339
00:26:43,195 --> 00:26:44,363
Get out.

340
00:26:45,614 --> 00:26:47,407
Read Pablo's letter.

341
00:26:48,533 --> 00:26:50,619
Maybe you will have a future.

342
00:27:02,923 --> 00:27:06,302
They just picked up
that commie priest, Father Sobrino.

343
00:27:06,385 --> 00:27:10,264
He's gonna talk. And when he does,
I hope you DEA boys understand

344
00:27:10,348 --> 00:27:12,016
what's important in this hemisphere.

345
00:27:12,933 --> 00:27:15,519
Well, how about you, uh...
clue us in?

346
00:27:15,602 --> 00:27:19,106
Drug dealers, I mean, bad as they are,
they want your money.

347
00:27:19,898 --> 00:27:21,233
Communists want everything.

348
00:27:21,859 --> 00:27:26,738
I don't know about you, Peña, but I...
I like to own shit.

349
00:27:26,947 --> 00:27:28,199
Right.

350
00:27:29,616 --> 00:27:30,868
Good talk, Lou.

351
00:27:30,951 --> 00:27:33,954
- Very, uh... enlightening.
- Yeah.

352
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,123
Oh...

353
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:41,128
This... priest?

354
00:27:41,962 --> 00:27:45,465
If it comes out that he was your informant
and you protected him...

355
00:27:46,591 --> 00:27:48,260
I'm gonna make sure
you're tried for treason.

356
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:57,936
Peña had to figure out
how to get fake papers for Elisa.

357
00:27:58,896 --> 00:28:00,814
So he did what he does best.

358
00:28:01,023 --> 00:28:03,984
It's a very
sad and complicated situation

359
00:28:04,068 --> 00:28:05,610
involving you and a beautiful local.

360
00:28:05,694 --> 00:28:09,448
You got your nails done.
It's... It's your color, Colleen.

361
00:28:10,699 --> 00:28:12,243
- What do you want, Javier?
- It's simple.

362
00:28:12,326 --> 00:28:14,786
I just need your signature...
right there.

363
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,290
You want me to create an embassy ID?

364
00:28:18,374 --> 00:28:20,167
- Who is this woman?
- What I want you to do

365
00:28:20,334 --> 00:28:23,212
is sidestep a little bullshit bureaucracy
and help someone stay alive.

366
00:28:24,713 --> 00:28:27,507
You really think I'd be asking you
if it wasn't important?

367
00:28:27,591 --> 00:28:29,301
She's my informant.

368
00:28:29,385 --> 00:28:31,803
And she could be the key to bringing down
the whole Medellín cartel,

369
00:28:31,887 --> 00:28:34,014
so come on, Colleen,
whose side are you on?

370
00:28:50,489 --> 00:28:52,324
Cousin, what happened?

371
00:28:53,409 --> 00:28:54,701
Where were you?

372
00:28:55,869 --> 00:28:57,496
- In the office.
- In the office?

373
00:28:57,579 --> 00:28:58,705
Yes.

374
00:28:59,539 --> 00:29:01,333
Is that where you were?

375
00:29:04,586 --> 00:29:06,088
That's weird...

376
00:29:07,047 --> 00:29:10,384
because I called
and they said you hadn't been in all day.

377
00:29:10,592 --> 00:29:14,346
I don't know which office you called,
but I was there.

378
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:16,932
They're seizing everything, Pablo.
All the accounts...

379
00:29:17,015 --> 00:29:19,559
We knew there would
be a reaction with Galán, right?

380
00:29:19,768 --> 00:29:21,645
Yeah.

381
00:29:21,728 --> 00:29:23,605
Relax, Gustavo.

382
00:29:25,065 --> 00:29:27,859
Relax, because everything
will calm down later.

383
00:29:37,828 --> 00:29:40,664
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna kill us both?

384
00:29:40,747 --> 00:29:43,875
- You afraid to die?
- No. Are you?

385
00:29:52,176 --> 00:29:54,636
- Put it out.
- Where were you?

386
00:29:54,845 --> 00:29:56,555
Put it out, Pablo.

387
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,517
Put it out, Pablo!

388
00:30:08,484 --> 00:30:09,776
Are you with me or what?

389
00:30:12,571 --> 00:30:14,448
And when have I not been with you?

390
00:30:18,494 --> 00:30:21,455
From the beginning,
it has been you and me.

391
00:30:24,333 --> 00:30:26,877
I cannot do this without you.

392
00:30:31,256 --> 00:30:33,675
Are you doubting my loyalty, Pablo?

393
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:37,888
No.

394
00:30:40,891 --> 00:30:44,603
But I'm having serious doubts
about the Ochoas.

395
00:31:08,293 --> 00:31:10,754
Gaviria read Pablo's letter.

396
00:31:13,632 --> 00:31:15,759
The terms were simple.

397
00:31:15,967 --> 00:31:19,721
He promised peace
if the narcos were left alone...

398
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:23,767
and if not...
he promised all-out war.

399
00:31:29,523 --> 00:31:34,236
Carrillo with his wiretaps
knew a storm was on the horizon.

400
00:31:35,112 --> 00:31:38,240
Pablo became his duty
and his obsession.

401
00:31:38,865 --> 00:31:41,326
He came to recognize Pablo's voice,

402
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:44,329
his sleep patterns,
what he liked to eat,

403
00:31:44,413 --> 00:31:47,916
his tastes in art,
his love of silk sheets,

404
00:31:47,999 --> 00:31:49,460
and his favorite music.

405
00:32:02,139 --> 00:32:03,932
He would die
for the love of his wife

406
00:32:04,015 --> 00:32:05,476
when you'd hear him over the airwaves.

407
00:32:09,854 --> 00:32:13,150
But did she know
how easily he ordered his men to kill?

408
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:16,945
He came to understand
that Pablo spoke in code.

409
00:32:17,112 --> 00:32:18,489
Time to thin the herd.

410
00:32:18,572 --> 00:32:21,866
"Cattle" were judges
or politicians who supported extradition.

411
00:32:22,075 --> 00:32:23,868
But did we score a goal?

412
00:32:23,952 --> 00:32:25,870
The reporter, right.

413
00:32:28,206 --> 00:32:30,501
Let's make sure
we score a goal on him as well.

414
00:32:30,584 --> 00:32:32,711
A "goal" was a targeted assassination.

415
00:32:33,671 --> 00:32:34,672
Come on, come on.

416
00:32:34,754 --> 00:32:37,257
If you spoke out against him,
you were dead.

417
00:32:37,341 --> 00:32:39,468
- The list grew by the week.
- Ooh!

418
00:32:40,177 --> 00:32:43,763
Guillermo Cano, editor of El Espectador,

419
00:32:43,847 --> 00:32:46,224
and his reporter, Luis Camacho.

420
00:32:46,933 --> 00:32:51,689
Jaime Rodríguez, the former head
of the anti-drug squad before Carrillo.

421
00:32:51,771 --> 00:32:54,232
The drumbeat went on and on.

422
00:32:54,316 --> 00:32:57,027
For Carrillo,
the war had already started.

423
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:59,029
But he just couldn't trust his army.

424
00:32:59,112 --> 00:33:02,574
You are aware
that I can end your military career?

425
00:33:02,658 --> 00:33:04,409
- I don't give a fuck.
- Excuse me?

426
00:33:04,493 --> 00:33:07,412
Horacio... don't give up.

427
00:33:08,288 --> 00:33:11,958
You've always been the leader
of the persecution of Pablo Escobar.

428
00:33:12,042 --> 00:33:14,169
Is this how you show your appreciation
for all we've done?

429
00:33:14,252 --> 00:33:16,296
This operation
could be a failure before it starts.

430
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:18,674
I'm not here for fun.

431
00:33:18,757 --> 00:33:20,384
What's gonna happen
is the defense minister

432
00:33:20,467 --> 00:33:23,887
will give you credit for the evidence
that we found at Hacienda Nápoles.

433
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:28,016
So... then if you resign,
I will look really bad.

434
00:33:28,099 --> 00:33:30,227
Is that what you're doing?
Is that what you want?

435
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:32,437
Horacio...
you remember when were cadets,

436
00:33:32,521 --> 00:33:37,234
we never thought they would call us
to lead the country's most important unit.

437
00:33:38,068 --> 00:33:41,154
Horacio, as your friend...
I'm asking you to think about it.

438
00:33:41,238 --> 00:33:43,782
Rodrigo, I don't even know who Pablo pays.

439
00:33:44,616 --> 00:33:46,159
It could be any of us three.

440
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:50,914
- Horacio, please.
- I've put my family at risk.

441
00:33:50,997 --> 00:33:54,543
If there is going to be a war,
I need the right tools.

442
00:33:55,877 --> 00:33:57,504
All right.

443
00:33:57,588 --> 00:33:58,838
Perfect.

444
00:34:00,424 --> 00:34:02,509
Then tell me what you need. Hm?

445
00:34:04,261 --> 00:34:06,388
Incorruptible men.

446
00:34:06,597 --> 00:34:09,307
And that's how the Search Bloc came to be.

447
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:25,449
But Carrillo
wasn't the only one recruiting soldiers.

448
00:34:31,705 --> 00:34:34,625
Hey, punk. Are you all right?

449
00:34:34,708 --> 00:34:36,794
- Sure.
- Come here.

450
00:34:38,378 --> 00:34:41,632
La Quica and Poison
had kids deliver packages.

451
00:34:41,715 --> 00:34:43,258
And if they didn't look inside,

452
00:34:43,467 --> 00:34:47,137
it meant they could be trusted
to deliver anything from cocaine to...

453
00:34:48,472 --> 00:34:49,473
well, anything else.

454
00:35:05,113 --> 00:35:06,698
How are you, son?

455
00:35:08,325 --> 00:35:10,327
- How are you?
- Good.

456
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:31,306
I have to kill that son of a bitch.

457
00:35:33,057 --> 00:35:37,646
Carrillo's a cop.
You can always buy a cop with money.

458
00:35:37,729 --> 00:35:41,191
- I've tried, believe me.
- Then offer more.

459
00:35:41,775 --> 00:35:46,738
Or I can loan you Navegante.
He will do whatever I ask.

460
00:35:50,283 --> 00:35:51,827
That's true.

461
00:35:52,828 --> 00:35:58,124
It's silver or lead.
That's the choice for that bastard.

462
00:35:58,208 --> 00:36:03,213
Speaking of lead,
I'm getting a shipment of weapons in.

463
00:36:03,296 --> 00:36:05,131
Uzis, grenades...

464
00:36:05,215 --> 00:36:11,137
If I could find a nuclear weapon...
But now I'm negotiating a fucking missile.

465
00:36:11,221 --> 00:36:14,307
- A missile? No fucking way.
- Yes.

466
00:36:14,391 --> 00:36:15,684
- Boss.
- Eh?

467
00:36:15,767 --> 00:36:19,187
This is crack cocaine,
seized a few days ago

468
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:21,439
by drug enforcement agents,

469
00:36:21,523 --> 00:36:24,735
in a park just across the street
from the White House.

470
00:36:24,943 --> 00:36:28,196
And our message
to the drug cartels is this:

471
00:36:28,405 --> 00:36:29,907
the rules have changed.

472
00:36:30,073 --> 00:36:32,283
He's bullshitting, right?

473
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:36,663
He's smoking that shit.
I guarantee it.

474
00:36:39,249 --> 00:36:41,459
Motherfucker.

475
00:36:43,628 --> 00:36:45,630
Mm...

476
00:36:50,009 --> 00:36:54,639
Mrs. Quiroga told me
the neighbors on the block took a vote.

477
00:36:54,723 --> 00:36:56,015
They want us to move.

478
00:36:56,224 --> 00:37:00,604
But we have guards stationed
outside the house 24 hours a day.

479
00:37:00,687 --> 00:37:02,230
That's what scares them.

480
00:37:05,776 --> 00:37:07,277
Come here.

481
00:37:09,195 --> 00:37:11,740
It won't always be like this,
my love.

482
00:37:36,598 --> 00:37:38,224
- Rodrigo.
- Hello, Horacio.

483
00:37:38,308 --> 00:37:40,226
- Everything OK?
- May I speak with you?

484
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:41,895
Yes, sure. Come in, come in.

485
00:37:43,688 --> 00:37:45,482
Let's talk about the incorruptibles.

486
00:37:47,233 --> 00:37:48,652
I'm listening.

487
00:37:55,993 --> 00:38:00,038
I've been instructed to tell you that
if you cease and desist your operations,

488
00:38:00,121 --> 00:38:03,625
you will receive
a one-time payment of six million.

489
00:38:04,835 --> 00:38:07,462
Horacio... that's US dollars,
not pesos.

490
00:38:10,214 --> 00:38:11,883
Instructed by whom?

491
00:38:13,844 --> 00:38:15,762
I think you can guess.

492
00:38:17,973 --> 00:38:19,098
Say the name.

493
00:38:19,265 --> 00:38:20,934
You know who.

494
00:38:22,352 --> 00:38:23,603
Say the name, Rodrigo.

495
00:38:28,358 --> 00:38:29,567
Escobar.

496
00:38:35,281 --> 00:38:39,202
Don't look at me like that, Horacio.
I've always cared for you.

497
00:38:39,285 --> 00:38:43,665
I'm making this suggestion to save
you and your family from terrible grief.

498
00:38:46,084 --> 00:38:48,169
This man has tentacles.

499
00:38:48,252 --> 00:38:51,089
I'm surprised
he hasn't killed you already.

500
00:38:53,008 --> 00:38:54,133
Get out.

501
00:38:56,427 --> 00:38:58,013
Horacio, please...

502
00:39:06,521 --> 00:39:07,647
Horacio...

503
00:39:16,406 --> 00:39:17,657
Take care.

504
00:39:24,414 --> 00:39:27,876
I was driving to the church.

505
00:39:27,959 --> 00:39:30,712
Was with my buddy, John.
He was my best man.

506
00:39:31,922 --> 00:39:34,799
We were late.

507
00:39:34,883 --> 00:39:37,928
It was fucking blazing outside,
110 degrees.

508
00:39:38,011 --> 00:39:41,180
Whole bridal party was there
sweating their balls off, I'm sure.

509
00:39:42,766 --> 00:39:46,019
And all of a sudden, I stopped the car.

510
00:39:46,103 --> 00:39:48,146
Please don't tell me
you left her at the altar.

511
00:39:49,064 --> 00:39:50,941
I don't know if she actually
made it to the altar.

512
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:57,196
Well, you saved her
a lifetime of hell.

513
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,951
Yeah, she forgave me. Eventually.

514
00:40:01,034 --> 00:40:04,537
- Married a stockbroker from Dallas.
- Hm.

515
00:40:04,621 --> 00:40:07,498
Randy... I think.

516
00:40:10,961 --> 00:40:13,171
Trust me, she's better off.

517
00:40:16,633 --> 00:40:19,636
What if Father Sobrino talks?

518
00:40:21,512 --> 00:40:23,056
He's gonna talk.

519
00:40:53,003 --> 00:40:55,379
It's about time, Navegante.

520
00:40:58,883 --> 00:41:02,762
Sorry I'm late. I couldn't came before.

521
00:41:03,471 --> 00:41:04,848
What do you got?

522
00:41:06,224 --> 00:41:08,267
Gacha's going tonight to Cartagena.

523
00:41:12,897 --> 00:41:14,649
I can help you get him.

524
00:41:14,732 --> 00:41:17,318
You said you had information.
You didn't say Gacha.

525
00:41:19,029 --> 00:41:20,822
I guess is your lucky day.

526
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:30,581
- What's the informant's motivation?
- Could be money.

527
00:41:30,748 --> 00:41:34,127
The reward for Gacha is one million US.
I'd say that's pretty good motivation.

528
00:41:34,211 --> 00:41:37,047
He spends his life on the run
if we don't catch him.

529
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:40,050
- Something else going on with this guy.
- It's worth taking a risk.

530
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:47,473
Peña, you go to Cartagena.
Solely in an observational capacity.

531
00:41:47,557 --> 00:41:51,186
We want this man captured alive,
if possible.

532
00:41:51,269 --> 00:41:52,603
Murphy stays here in Bogotá.

533
00:41:52,812 --> 00:41:55,065
Gaviria's press conference is tonight,

534
00:41:55,148 --> 00:41:58,985
and I wanna be sure whatever
he plans to say, he gets to say it.

535
00:42:01,238 --> 00:42:02,739
Yes, ma'am.

536
00:42:02,822 --> 00:42:05,116
That's a beautiful dress,
Ambassador Noonan.

537
00:42:07,368 --> 00:42:10,288
Come on, Father. Ah, yeah. Talk!

538
00:42:13,208 --> 00:42:15,960
Huh?

539
00:42:19,964 --> 00:42:21,925
Huh?

540
00:42:22,133 --> 00:42:25,178
More? You want more?

541
00:42:25,262 --> 00:42:28,639
No! No more, please! No more!

542
00:42:28,723 --> 00:42:30,850
No more!

543
00:42:31,059 --> 00:42:33,436
Ah, he's all yours.
He's ready to talk.

544
00:42:34,395 --> 00:42:35,563
Father...

545
00:42:37,065 --> 00:42:39,943
how did Elisa Alvaro get away?

546
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:51,454
She left with the American woman.

547
00:42:53,497 --> 00:42:56,500
Murphy's wife.

548
00:42:57,501 --> 00:43:02,090
I just don't understand.
How'd you get involved with communists?

549
00:43:02,173 --> 00:43:04,175
Have you actually met a communist?

550
00:43:04,259 --> 00:43:06,636
Yeah, I have, actually...
and she lied to me.

551
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:08,554
Well, I'm not a communist, Connie.

552
00:43:08,763 --> 00:43:12,183
I'm fighting against poverty,
corruption, injustice and greed.

553
00:43:12,391 --> 00:43:14,894
But I guess Americans
don't have the same problem.

554
00:43:14,978 --> 00:43:16,271
Don't we?

555
00:43:16,354 --> 00:43:17,897
It's not the same.

556
00:43:17,981 --> 00:43:20,233
Look, I just wish
you'd been straight with me.

557
00:43:21,692 --> 00:43:22,944
I'm sorry.

558
00:43:23,653 --> 00:43:24,988
Perhaps I should go.

559
00:43:26,156 --> 00:43:29,993
You can't just go.
Look, if they find you, they'll kill you.

560
00:43:31,828 --> 00:43:34,998
I fell in love with a man...
with a good man.

561
00:43:35,081 --> 00:43:37,667
And I was hoping
to do something good.

562
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:42,672
But instead, I fell into something...
else, something more violent.

563
00:43:44,465 --> 00:43:46,592
Yeah, that makes two of us.

564
00:43:52,682 --> 00:43:53,975
I'll see you when I get home.

565
00:43:59,689 --> 00:44:01,732
Here, Elisa's ID.

566
00:44:01,816 --> 00:44:04,902
- What am I supposed to do with that?
- Take her to Cumaral.

567
00:44:04,986 --> 00:44:06,487
My contact there agreed to hide her.

568
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:07,989
While you go to Cartagena?

569
00:44:08,072 --> 00:44:10,200
I can't believe this shit.

570
00:44:10,283 --> 00:44:12,994
- Who made this?
- Brother, what do you suggest we do?

571
00:44:13,077 --> 00:44:14,537
Jump out of a window?

572
00:44:16,998 --> 00:44:18,291
Look, she's...

573
00:44:20,293 --> 00:44:22,795
- She's important.
- To who?

574
00:44:23,754 --> 00:44:25,048
To us.

575
00:44:32,555 --> 00:44:37,227
I take care of Elisa...
you better fucking get Gacha.

576
00:44:45,651 --> 00:44:47,653
Finally, a romantic date.

577
00:44:48,654 --> 00:44:50,281
It's been a long time
since we've been alone.

578
00:44:50,365 --> 00:44:55,870
Mm. Just you, me...
and our bodyguard.

579
00:44:58,789 --> 00:45:02,501
Like the old days when we were young
and your father watched us.

580
00:45:02,585 --> 00:45:06,089
- Mm. My father adored you.
- Yeah, right.

581
00:45:25,942 --> 00:45:28,069
Garcia...

582
00:45:43,334 --> 00:45:45,628
Hello? Yes.

583
00:45:50,049 --> 00:45:51,259
Yes.

584
00:45:54,095 --> 00:45:55,638
But he's all right?

585
00:45:58,641 --> 00:45:59,976
All right.

586
00:46:16,534 --> 00:46:18,328
Ana?

587
00:46:29,422 --> 00:46:30,465
Ana?

588
00:46:39,765 --> 00:46:40,975
Ana?

589
00:46:45,188 --> 00:46:46,356
Ana!

590
00:46:49,526 --> 00:46:53,821
A little bird... came into the house.

591
00:46:53,904 --> 00:46:55,532
I'm helping it out.

592
00:47:06,792 --> 00:47:07,960
What?

593
00:47:13,257 --> 00:47:15,301
There was an assassination attempt...

594
00:47:17,387 --> 00:47:19,847
on Colonel Carrillo.

595
00:47:19,930 --> 00:47:21,224
Did someone die?

596
00:47:22,433 --> 00:47:24,852
One of his men.

597
00:47:26,937 --> 00:47:29,190
It must be terrible,

598
00:47:29,273 --> 00:47:31,484
the position you're in.

599
00:47:31,609 --> 00:47:34,862
I want you to know
I think you are very brave.

600
00:47:37,698 --> 00:47:41,452
I'm not brave. Not like Galán.

601
00:47:42,661 --> 00:47:44,747
That fear keeps you alive.

602
00:47:46,332 --> 00:47:48,876
That's what none of them understand.

603
00:47:52,713 --> 00:47:56,259
I will support any decision you make.

604
00:48:03,682 --> 00:48:07,478
It's been said that
nothing gives the fearful more courage...

605
00:48:08,354 --> 00:48:10,398
than another's fear.

606
00:48:13,776 --> 00:48:19,031
Luis Carlos Galán
had made a decision that cost his life.

607
00:48:21,033 --> 00:48:23,953
And now, it was Gaviria's turn.

608
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:29,083
Welcome, American press.

609
00:48:29,166 --> 00:48:32,169
Tonight, I have the great pleasure

610
00:48:32,378 --> 00:48:36,257
of introducing candidate César Gaviria.

611
00:48:56,152 --> 00:49:00,156
It has long been
our government's policy...

612
00:49:01,491 --> 00:49:07,788
to deal with every man equally...
in the eyes of the law.

613
00:49:09,873 --> 00:49:11,167
So...

614
00:49:31,646 --> 00:49:33,189
Colombians say...

615
00:49:35,107 --> 00:49:37,652
God made our land so beautiful...

616
00:49:38,736 --> 00:49:41,238
it was unfair to the rest of the world.

617
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:45,117
So to even the score...

618
00:49:46,619 --> 00:49:52,208
God populated the land...
with a race of evil men.

619
00:49:55,211 --> 00:50:00,633
The primary impediment
to a free and uninhibited future

620
00:50:00,841 --> 00:50:06,681
is the violence and terror
that currently grips our beloved country.

621
00:50:08,098 --> 00:50:12,853
A violence initiated by these evil men...

622
00:50:13,937 --> 00:50:16,357
will be brought to justice...

623
00:50:18,817 --> 00:50:20,944
in the name of decency...

624
00:50:23,531 --> 00:50:26,033
and in the memory of Luis Carlos Galán.

625
00:50:26,242 --> 00:50:28,661
We will extradite.

626
00:50:29,412 --> 00:50:33,916
This decision...
will not come from fear.

627
00:50:35,167 --> 00:50:38,837
It has come from a clarity of judgment...

628
00:50:39,838 --> 00:50:43,718
free from the cloud of terror
that surrounds us

629
00:50:43,801 --> 00:50:45,261
and obscures our view.

630
00:50:47,888 --> 00:50:52,393
I can say only one thing to Colombians
in these times of peril:

631
00:50:56,814 --> 00:50:59,442
There will be a future.

632
00:51:04,655 --> 00:51:07,491
Thank you.

633
00:51:57,958 --> 00:51:59,209
Hello?

634
00:52:00,377 --> 00:52:02,630
You think you're hot shit?

635
00:52:02,713 --> 00:52:05,090
You should change your satellite phone.

636
00:52:06,967 --> 00:52:08,385
Who is this?

637
00:52:08,469 --> 00:52:12,055
Your mother's in Rionegro
with that tub of lard you call your son.

638
00:52:13,182 --> 00:52:16,477
And your wife was at Carrera 11 today,
shopping for clothes.

639
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:19,605
You bastard son of a bitch,
you think that...

640
00:52:19,689 --> 00:52:22,525
What, you think because you're a cop
I'm afraid of you or something?

641
00:52:22,608 --> 00:52:25,862
You know where my family is, fag,
well, I know where yours is, too.

642
00:52:25,944 --> 00:52:27,946
- Don't forget that.
- Gonorrhea bastard son of a bitch.

643
00:52:28,030 --> 00:52:30,199
Why don't you take money
like everyone else?

644
00:52:30,282 --> 00:52:33,035
I could have had you living like a king.
But now, guess what?

645
00:52:33,118 --> 00:52:38,541
Time to kill your dad, your mom,
your kids, your entire family,

646
00:52:38,624 --> 00:52:40,835
and you should be smart enough to realize

647
00:52:40,918 --> 00:52:45,422
I have each and every one of them
under watch, you fucking bastard.

648
00:52:45,506 --> 00:52:48,008
Not everyone's for sale, Pablo.

649
00:52:48,091 --> 00:52:50,928
You just keep hiding,
and I will find you.

650
00:52:51,011 --> 00:52:52,388
Don't know when...

651
00:52:52,596 --> 00:52:54,390
but I will find you.

652
00:52:55,182 --> 00:52:56,851
And when I find you...

653
00:52:57,852 --> 00:52:59,645
- I'm going to kill you.
- I'm going to kill you

654
00:52:59,729 --> 00:53:02,147
and your entire family,
you son of a bitch!

655
00:53:23,544 --> 00:53:25,629
It's war, then.
