Hey, Jung-sik?

6
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:47,881
How is it?

7
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,416
What do you think.

8
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:51,751
I need it for the drama next week

9
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:53,186
so tell him it's great!

10
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:55,021
Like Seung-chul ever listens to me.

11
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:58,324
Then make him. He's gotta do this song.

12
00:00:58,324 --> 00:01:01,623
But the lyrics are weak, man.

13
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:04,230
What the suits say
goes. That's show biz.

14

Whatever, man!

15

- Hold up!
- What is it?

16
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:09,235
You like this song?

17
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,470
Of course! Why?

18
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:14,074
Singing about a girl to
come back to me at my age?

19
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,776
My heart this and tears that...

20
00:01:16,776 --> 00:01:17,777
Isn't it childish?

21
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:21,047
No! It's perfect! Don't you think?

22
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:21,748
It's great.

23
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,983
Make your fans really
feel the song, man!

24
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:25,985
But I don't feel anything!

25
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:29,689
You can do it, man. Feel me?

26
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:30,690
- It's great!
- No.

27
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,681
It's not working for me.

28
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:37,097
Seung-chul! Come on!

29
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,429

31

Please?

49

'Hee-ya, please look at me.'

54

Give me a break.

55
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:30,717
That was a hit only cuz you sang it.

56

Wanna hear this song I got?

57

What is it?

58
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:36,756
It's off a flopped album.

59
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:38,958
Forget it, kid!

60
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:41,261
Let's hear it.

61
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:43,525

<i>To give you everything</i>

Who wrote this? The lyrics are great.

64
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,037
Really? Then let's ask
them to write our lyrics.

65
00:02:58,278 --> 00:02:59,646
Who wrote this?

66
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:03,116
Not sure. I got this off someone.

67
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:03,917
Who?

68
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:06,452
Min-chul. He used to
work for KIM Gap-sik.

69
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:08,682
Gap-sik? I know him well.

70
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:13,725
Hey, didn't he leave the biz?

71
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,994
Who does your friend work for now?

72
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:17,263
He left the biz, too.

73
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:18,298
What does he do?

74
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:20,493
He runs a cafe in Chung-pyung.

75
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:23,394
Wanna go over, Seung-chul?

76
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,868
- Know where it is?
- Yes.

77
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:26,673
Lead the way.

78
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:29,233
<i>Director WON</i>

79
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:34,104
Got the album?

80
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,442
Ah, here.

81
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:39,517
What's the title?

82
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:41,415
It's the second track.

83
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,985
Second track?

84
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:51,531
'No one else like Thee' by Cream?

85
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:52,930
What's her real name?

86
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:57,867
I think it was EUN
Won. Yeah, that' s it.

87
00:03:58,104 --> 00:03:59,867
Got her number?

88
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:01,507
She's gone.

89
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:03,810
Gone? To where?

90
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,479
Right after KANG Chul-kyu left...

91
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:10,643
KANG knows her well?

92
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:15,612
Of course. He was
totally in love with her.

93
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:19,117
Do you have KANG's number?

94
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:21,757
- He died.
- He's dead?

95
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:23,129
When?

96
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:26,621
About a month after
he married off EUN Won.

97
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,764
Mr. KANG!

98
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,330
What was the name of his show?

99
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,408
'Ugly Ducklings in Love'.

100
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:37,744
Yeah, that's it!

101
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:40,947
He married off the woman he loved?

102
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,814
- What does that mean?
- Well...

103
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:48,050
Tell us what happened.

104
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:51,418
It's a long story.

105
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,138
Hi, Chul-kyu!

106
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:59,223
<i>KANG said he saw stars</i>

107
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:00,593
<i>when he first met Cream.</i>

108
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:02,584
Why you little punk!

109
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:11,036
<i>Like he'd been slapped</i>
<i>on the back of his head.</i>

110
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:14,262
<i>He said it was love</i>
<i>at first sight.</i>

111
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:17,108
<i>Without even talking to her.</i>

112
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,803
<i>I asked,</i>

113
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,777
<i>'Shouldn't you at least</i>
<i>say a few words, first? '</i>

114
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:24,473
<i>Then he said...</i>

115
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:29,378
<i>If you need words,</i>
<i>then how can mutes love?</i>

116
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:46,706
How did you know my name?

117
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:50,938
Isn't it a waste living
in this big place alone?

118
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:55,743
Want me to live with you?

119
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:16,402
Think of a name for me,
and I'll make one for you.

120
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:18,495
We can't change our names.

121
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:20,396
Why not?

122
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:23,874
<i>Her name is Cream</i>
<i>and my name is K.</i>

123
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:26,779
<i>She was cold like ice cream,</i>

124
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,582
<i>- but also sweet like ice
cream.</i> - The curtains won't do.

125
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:30,783
We're changing everything.

126
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:33,377
<i>And she was</i>
<i>soft like ice cream.</i>

127
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:39,687
<i>And I'm not</i> <i>A, B, C,
D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K...</i>

128
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:41,754
<i>But just K.</i>

129
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:57,702
<i>We had a lot in common.</i>

130
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:02,137
<i>We were the same age.</i>
<i>We both liked noodles.</i>

131
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:06,812
<i>We loved listening to
music</i> <i>on rainy days.</i>

132
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:10,716
<i>We loved coffee.</i>

133
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:15,490
<i>We hated school.</i>

134
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,796
<i>She liked me.</i>

135
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:24,802
<i>And I liked her.</i>

136
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,873
<i>And we were both orphans.</i>

137
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:34,313
<i>Prison and love...</i>

138
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:37,180
<i>Once you're stuck,</i>
<i>you can't get out.</i>

139
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:45,348
<i>I fell in love with Cream.</i>

140
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:51,160
<i>Even the very air she breathed.</i>

141
00:08:57,737 --> 00:09:00,570
<i>Romeo must've been so worried...</i>

142
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:05,607
<i>Ioving Juliet,</i> <i>but
afraid he might lose her.</i>

143
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,784
<i>Why did he drink the poison?</i>

144
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:18,350
<i>Perhaps he knew.</i>

145
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:22,161
<i>To love someone</i>

146
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:24,391
<i>- is to give her
everything.</i> - I'll visit often.

147
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:33,900
<i>I received so much from her</i>
<i>like the catcher who gets the ball.</i>

148
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,277
<i>Love was like dry ice.</i>
<i>Sometimes cold, sometimes hot.</i>

149
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:39,335
Wait!

150
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:41,275
<i>Cream was so loveable.</i>

151
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:49,048
<i>But I couldn't tell her</i>
<i>that I loved her.</i>

152
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:57,692
<i>Cuz I had cancer cells in me</i>
<i>ready to strike at any time.</i>

153
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:06,200
<i>More than Blue</i>

154
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:45,177
Thank you, Mr. KIM.

155
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:48,648
It's the least I can do.

156
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:52,018
Writers need to eat well
to do all that thinking.

157
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:57,556
Have some soup with the
Kimbap and chew carefully.

158
00:10:57,556 --> 00:10:59,659
Is this your new singer?

159
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:06,087
Greet them, girl. They're
the best writers in SBC.

160
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:11,404
Hello, I'm Cat Girl. I
promise to sing my heart out.

161
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:13,599
Damn right you should.

162
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:15,941
Great outfit.

163
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:19,035
It's a new concept. She's a cat.

164
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:21,347
It's Cat Girl.

165
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:25,818
This gal's got brains.

166
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:28,921
She's a student at Seoul University.

167
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:30,582
Really?

168
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,926
It's Seoul University of Arts.

169
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:35,951
Who's side are you on?

170
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:38,731
You could get in trouble for
lying about schools these days.

171
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:43,235
If you're so holy, go be a cop instead.

172
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:44,293
Sorry.

173
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:48,971
Mr. Kang!

174
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:49,975
How are you?

175
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:54,173
Here's Seung-chul's
new album. It's deep.

176
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:57,783
- It's a sure hit.
- I'm sure it's great.

177
00:11:57,783 --> 00:11:58,851
- Say hi.
- Hello.

178
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:00,113
Call me K.

179
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,488
Let's go for drinks some time.

180
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,217
- Sounds great.
- Bye.

181
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:08,094
Seoul Univ. of Arts. Same difference.

182
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:09,395
That's right.

183
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,828
Did you eat, sir?

184
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:12,832
Mr. Kang!

185
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:15,134
- How've you been?
- I waited so long for you.

186
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:18,804
She's Cats. Damn, I keep forgetting.

187
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:20,897
It's Cat Girl, sir.

188
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:24,804
Go on and introduce yourself, girl.

189
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:29,715
I'm Cat Girl. I promise
to sing my heart out.

190
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:30,883
Thank you.

191
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:33,545
Of course you should.

192
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:36,789
Let's go some place
quiet to talk, Mr. Kang.

193
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:39,121
See you folks later.

194
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:43,929
- Come on, what are pals for.
- I can't.

195
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:47,865
It's just a show of my appreciation.

196
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,668
The album's finished?

197
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:53,372
I put together all the
best songwriters around.

198
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:56,603
You know me, I get what I want.

199
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,277
How is she?

200
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:01,781
Oh, her? Not bad.

201
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:05,785
But she has trouble getting
along with the others.

202
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,120
Still she's got talent. Be nice.

203
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,715
Of course. Anything for you.

204
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,961
- But do this for me.
- I can't.

205
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:18,452
It's not much. Please, take it!

206
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:25,704
I can't sleep at the thought of you.

207
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:31,074
My dear love.

208
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:38,584
That part you just sang. Try
not to scream it this time.

209
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:40,575
You'll scare 'em off.

210
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:44,217
How, sir?

211
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:50,929
How would you feel if someone
screamed they loved you?

212
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:56,600
You know, softly and
tenderly? You're good at that.

213
00:13:56,702 --> 00:14:01,298
What? Not that. Stop making me do it.

214
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,036
- That's not what I meant!
- Roll it!

215
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:17,420
What's she so good at?

216
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:21,418
Drop it will ya, man?

217
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,859
Come on. Just between us?

218
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:33,300
She's my future. That's
all I can tell ya, man.

219
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:38,975
Did you fix the second verse?

220
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:40,578
What?

221
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:43,313
The climax on the second verse.

222
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:45,746
'AIways like yesterday'?

223
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:49,012
It's a little corny, isn't it?

224
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:53,919
'A world without love? ' How's that?

225
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,922
Like that's not corny?

226
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:05,767
It's just a suggestion.

227
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:12,868
Let's not get too excited here.

228
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:20,516
You two write it, then. I'm out.

229
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,585
What?

230
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:28,823
So feisty.

231
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:54,583
Do you have to become a singer?

232
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:57,078
What?

233
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:04,493
Got enough medication left?

234
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:22,172
My damn connection to your family.

235
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:29,512
First your father, now you.

236
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:34,417
There are too many illnesses
that can't be cured.

237
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:54,676
What's wrong?

238
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:01,049
What is it?

239
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:05,256
Don't cry.

240
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:07,782
Stop crying.

241
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:12,220
The bastards told me to rewrite it.

242
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:21,929
'lf I could live again'.
How's that for the title?

243
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:25,073
'lf I could live again? '

244
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:31,077
If you could, what would
you like to be reborn as?

245
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:34,216
Besides a person?

246
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:36,949
Anything.

247
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,124
Well...

248
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:45,025
If I could live again...

249
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:49,268
A ring?

250
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:50,667
Wait.

251
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,002
Start over.

252
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:04,743
If I could be born again...

253
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:07,315
A ring.

254
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:10,412
A pair of glasses.

255
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,551
A bed.

256
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:17,090
A diary.

257
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:20,732
Born again as things like
that? What fun is that?

258
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:25,294
You can buy me. It'll
always be fun at your side.

259
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:29,073
So sensible.

260
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:31,499
Did you eat?

261
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,404
Of course, I did.

262
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:36,244
Well, I didn't.

263
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,181
Then let's eat.

264
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,592
Is there anything you want to tell me?

265
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:49,324
Like what?

266
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:53,198
A deep, dark secret?

267
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:57,464
Think of it as a confession
at a Catholic church.

268
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:01,266
I'll be the priest and listen.

269
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:04,209
A deep, dark secret?

270
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:08,814
Say anything. I'm ready to listen.

271
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,441
I like you.

272
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,588
I want to ask you something.

273
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,519
Do you have a wish?

274
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:22,318
A wish?

275
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:26,225
If you could have anything in the world?

276
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:29,090
First, hold up your spoon.

277
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:35,099
Then?

278
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:37,802
Eat all your food.

279
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,277
Then?

280
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:50,785
Meet a great guy and get married.

281
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,253
Can't I marry you?

282
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,417
I'm not a great guy.

283
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:02,601
It wasn't my choice, but heaven's will,

284
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:05,971
to fall in love with you.

285
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:13,400
I was born to love you.
Heaven sent me to love you.

286
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,805
ID: Little Mermaid.

287
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:20,647
Now, for the requested song.

288
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:34,758
Your second toe is longer
than the first one like mine.

289
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:38,332
That means your mom will outlive you.

290
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,067
Who says that?

291
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:49,305
I think I read it somewhere.

292
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:51,305
It's a lie.

293
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,178
Why?

294
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:56,882
Cuz my Mom and Dad died on the same day.

295
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,616
If you...

296
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,456
If you die before me, I'll kill you!

297
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:15,329
<i>Here's another requested song.</i>

298
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,737
Are you finished?

299
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:54,703
Excuse me?

300
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:56,537
The coffee.

301
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,554
Then can I have the cup?

302
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:31,215
Which side did you drink from?

303
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,315
Pardon?

304
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,260
This isn't kissing, is it?

305
00:22:57,509 --> 00:23:00,342
- Hey.
- Yeah?

306
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:07,478
- You know the guest doctor?
- Yeah?

307
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:10,922
What kind of doctor is he?

308
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:13,683
Huh?

309
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:22,363
We need to fill a cavity.
Amalgam is stronger than resin.

310
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,572
We kiss on the first day.

311
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:39,216
You see inside me, on the second day.

312
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:47,182
What should we do on the third day?

313
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:54,464
What?

314
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:58,496
We'll decide when the time comes.

315
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:09,571
I'm in love!

316
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:14,975
A guest on another show. He's a dentist.

317
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,923
Pass me the toothbrush?

318
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:34,399
You're listening to 'Happy Hour'.

319
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:37,836
- As you're out driving...
- Did you eat?

320
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:40,272
Oh, hi.

321
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:42,900
- Got a show to record, today?
- No.

322
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:48,141
The guest doctor on your show...

323
00:25:48,346 --> 00:25:52,112
Who? You mean CHA Joo-hwan?

324
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:54,185
How is he?

325
00:25:54,185 --> 00:25:57,279
He's a great guy. Why?

326
00:25:57,589 --> 00:26:00,625
Just wondering.

327
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:06,825
His family's rich, he's nice,
and he makes a ton of money.

328
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:09,865
And he's a famous dentist.

329
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:13,335
You look a little sad today.

330
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:16,141
Good job, bro.

331
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:17,909
It was fun.

332
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:21,646
- Great show.
- Cut it short.

333
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:24,206
Hey, nice seeing you.

334
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:26,184
Let's go out for drinks.

335
00:26:26,184 --> 00:26:28,587
Not if it's just a few drinks.

336
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:32,546
- How much then?
- All night?

337
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:34,124
All night! Alright!

338
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:38,062
<i>What's his social
security number?</i>

339
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:42,300
- 730313105... <i>
- 730313...</i>

340
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:47,105
Sure you can get his medical records?

341
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:49,665
<i>Insurance companies
get everything.</i>

342
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:52,143
<i>But why do you want</i>
<i>to check out a guy?</i>

343
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:53,845
I'll tell you later.

344
00:26:53,845 --> 00:26:59,340
<i>Bingo! He's got life</i>
<i>and medical insurance.</i>

345
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:02,887
<i>No record of family illness</i>
<i>or any operations.</i>

346
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:06,758
<i>He has an impeccable</i>
<i>health record.</i>

347
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:08,093
You sure?

348
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:10,495
<i>Insurance companies know</i>
<i>how to make money, man.</i>

349
00:27:10,495 --> 00:27:11,262
KANG!

350
00:27:11,262 --> 00:27:13,765
<i>If he has a hospital
record,</i> <i>we'll see it.</i>

351
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:14,799
KANG!

352
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,664
Thanks. I owe you one.

353
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:20,905
Got a minute Mr. KIM?

354
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:23,772
For you, any time!

355
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:31,037
It's a gift.

356
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:37,253
Ah, thank you.

357
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:40,284
Just a thank you?

358
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:46,558
First my lips, then my insides...

359
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:49,726
Now, you're in my head.

360
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:52,166
Buy me a drink?

361
00:27:58,143 --> 00:27:59,542
A drink?

362
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:03,476
I don't get it.

363
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:10,953
Who would've thought I'd use my
former dark roots to help you?

364
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:16,494
No need to worry. Now about Cats.

365
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:20,799
Man, I gotta change that name!

366
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,767
It's Cat Girl, sir.

367
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:27,932
I know! It's up here
but I can't say it right!

368
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:31,943
Call me whatever you want, hon.

369
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:34,707
Who cares if it's a cat or a dog?

370
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:38,847
That's my pretty.

371
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:42,018
My sweet Cats.

372
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:45,990
We're changing the name.

373
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:51,096
- Ah, sir?
- I said, I know!

374
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:53,291
Not that. The phone.

375
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:58,732
Sorry, Producer KANG! I checked and...

376
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:03,638
You kids scram for a sec.

377
00:29:04,642 --> 00:29:07,236
I gotta take this call. Go!

378
00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:14,819
CHA Joo-hwan's family's loaded!

379
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:18,423
He even has a hot fiancé.

380
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:21,790
He's got it made.

381
00:29:21,993 --> 00:29:23,194
<i>Fianc</i>é<i>?</i>

382
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:26,095
Is something up?

383
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:35,666
Oh, you dropped your candy.

384
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:38,900
Let's put it in your pocket.

385
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:54,016
Have you ever been in love?

386
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:59,257
Like a rock thrown into the river.

387
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:05,293
Give me the ring.

388
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:06,728
Excuse me?

389
00:30:06,838 --> 00:30:08,499
Your ring.

390
00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:24,650
Like this.

391
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:42,734
Someone to pull you out. Like this.

392
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:47,373
I'm engaged.

393
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:59,119
It doesn't matter.

394
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:00,686
Let's keep drinking.

395
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,793
It's so cold.

396
00:31:14,472 --> 00:31:16,440
Did you drink?

397
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:29,308
What do you like so much about him?

398
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:34,490
I feel like I'm being sterilized.

399
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:39,321
Sterilized?

400
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:42,389
Sterilized.

401
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,164
Perfect.

402
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:35,018
- Let's eat.
- Sorry, I gotta run.

403
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:38,882
- You're not eating?
- I can't.

404
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:41,114
What about all this food?

405
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,093
You eat it all.

406
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:47,487
I'll see you later.

407
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:21,696
ABCDEFGHIJK...

408
00:33:57,602 --> 00:33:59,297
Hello?

409
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:02,573
<i>Is this EUN Won's number?</i>

410
00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:06,270
Yes, it is.

411
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:09,236
<i>May I speak to her, please?</i>

412
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:11,244
She's not here.

413
00:34:13,651 --> 00:34:15,887
<i>My name's CHA Joo-hwan.</i>

414
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,356
<i>We were supposed
to</i> <i>meet today</i>

415
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:22,560
<i>but something came
up</i> <i>at the clinic.</i>

416
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,296
<i>Is there any way</i>
<i>I can reach her?</i>

417
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:27,730
Where were you going to meet?

418
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:11,707
So cold.

419
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:14,537
Hey.

420
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:16,045
He can't come.

421
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:17,675
Who?

422
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:19,238
Him.

423
00:35:22,987 --> 00:35:24,454
The doc.

424
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,561
Where are you going?

425
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:32,222
I gotta go.

426
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:36,022
Sit down. The curry here is great.

427
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,904
You know I don't eat curry.

428
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,038
Then what do you want?

429
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:42,173
What else is there?

430
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:44,164
What do you want to eat?

431
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:46,837
Kimbap.

432
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:49,574
So boring.

433
00:35:49,747 --> 00:35:51,578
Just eat curry.

434
00:35:54,852 --> 00:35:56,376
You're buying.

435
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:03,654
Come on Producer KANG. Spill it.

436
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:06,092
Did he rip you off or something?

437
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:09,733
Then, why didn't you say so!

438
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:17,465
My boys can get the money
back before lunch in no time.

439
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:19,232
It's not that.

440
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:22,278
Then what is it?

441
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:28,077
Why would someone like you want
the dirt on some guy's fiancé even?

442
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:34,189
Are you interested in his fiancé?

443
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:36,987
Just find out, please.

444
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:38,755
Fine, then.

445
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:46,231
Anyway, Cats' album's
startin' to get noticed, now.

446
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:49,607
Let's cook up something with your show

447
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:52,974
and sell 'em like hot pancakes!

448
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:55,046
I'm sure it'll do well.

449
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,809
Of course.

450
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:58,513
Hey, Min-chul!

451
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:00,711
Did you like the house?

452
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:04,315
Mother said she liked it.

453
00:37:04,455 --> 00:37:06,355
It's not bad.

454
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:08,921
I heard you stopped holding exhibitions.

455
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:11,791
I'm tired of putting on shows.

456
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:15,965
And there's nothing to take pictures of.

457
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:23,002
I'm sorry I'm not more fun to be around.

458
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:27,838
Don't worry. I like
to have fun by myself.

459
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:30,341
That's sad.

460
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:36,211
- Let's have fun together from now on.
- Sure.

461
00:37:37,521 --> 00:37:40,854
Can I get an ashtray here?

462
00:37:41,225 --> 00:37:44,126
I'm sorry. There's no smoking here.

463
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:48,357
The world's such a bore.

464
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:51,333
Get her an ashtray to
put that out, please.

465
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:53,460
Yes, sir.

466
00:37:55,172 --> 00:37:56,799
Interesting.

467
00:37:57,141 --> 00:37:58,540
Keep smoking.

468
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:05,076
Should've known. She's
really somethin' all right.

469
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:09,048
She's got men coming out of her ears.

470
00:38:09,353 --> 00:38:12,723
I told 'em to take some good pics.

471
00:38:12,723 --> 00:38:13,924
It won't be long.

472
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:17,561
<i>How did you pose</i>
<i>for your album cover?</i>

473
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:20,831
I posed like I practiced
with my boss last night.

474
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:22,933
Exactly how?

475
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:25,036
<i>- Here?</i>
<i>- Pardon?</i>

476
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:28,597
Men are all the same.

477
00:38:30,007 --> 00:38:31,599
Okay, then.

478
00:38:33,911 --> 00:38:38,007
First, I open my eyes like a cat.

479
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:39,650
Like this.

480
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:42,219
- Ah, Cat Girl?
- Then...

481
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:45,323
I hold my hands up and
open my mouth like this.

482
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:48,292
Look at her. She's a natural born star!

483
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:50,055
You can just tell us.

484
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:52,963
But my boss said a star

485
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:55,499
<i>- has to speak with
the body.</i> - See that?

486
00:38:55,499 --> 00:39:00,938
Girls like her adjust so quickly.

487
00:39:00,938 --> 00:39:04,533
That foxy babe. Who wouldn't love her?

488
00:39:07,311 --> 00:39:09,980
- Ah, sir?
- KANG!

489
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,948
- What's wrong?
- KANG!

490
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:23,557
Where is he?

491
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:28,556
- Hey!
- I'm dead beat.

492
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:30,394
What's wrong with you!

493
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:32,359
What's with you!

494
00:39:33,904 --> 00:39:36,202
Don't start.

495
00:39:38,242 --> 00:39:42,042
Why does he keep fainting like this?

496
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:47,351
It's hereditary, but it could also be

497
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:49,954
not enough calcium in his diet.

498
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:56,660
We've been eating the same food
in the same house for years!

499
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:59,128
Why are you the only
one who keeps fainting!

500
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,530
You eat way more than I do.

501
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:08,000
You're only eating anchovies
from now on, got that!

502
00:40:27,057 --> 00:40:28,547
You!

503
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,560
Yes?

504
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:32,652
What did he just say?

505
00:40:34,064 --> 00:40:37,830
To break off your engagement...

506
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:42,200
- Stop! Please!
- Who are you!

507
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:46,573
What the hell are you trying to pull!

508
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:52,776
You don't wanna mess with me!

509
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:56,850
Get the hell out of my sight!

510
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,623
I said, get lost.

511
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:28,778
Why are you doing this?

512
00:41:30,187 --> 00:41:31,711
Huh?

513
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:36,853
You're a successful radio show producer.

514
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:40,428
Trailing a woman and
getting slapped like that.

515
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:43,534
Aren't you embarrassed?

516
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:46,002
I don't have time to be embarrassed.

517
00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:49,964
What are you talking about?

518
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:55,108
One mountain after
another. But no time to go.

519
00:41:59,383 --> 00:42:01,544
Ow, my head.

520
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:05,852
Does it hurt?

521
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:08,888
I'm hurt, too.

522
00:42:12,963 --> 00:42:15,227
What's with me today?

523
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:18,157
It's cuz we're sad.

524
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:24,397
Then cry instead of making jokes.

525
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:27,272
I don't want to cry.

526
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:31,345
Don't wanna make someone cry even more.

527
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:40,154
I'm dying. Just like my dad.

528
00:42:43,794 --> 00:42:45,489
Chul-kyu!

529
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:55,664
<i>Mom left me a year
after</i> <i>Dad died.</i>

530
00:42:59,176 --> 00:43:02,077
<i>It probably wasn't</i>
<i>cuz she resented me.</i>

531
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:05,505
<i>She was sick of
everything</i> <i>cuz of Dad.</i>

532
00:43:07,484 --> 00:43:12,217
<i>I understand.</i> <i>I was
sick of everything, too.</i>

533
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:18,091
<i>But when she left me all alone...</i>

534
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:21,525
<i>I was so Ionely.</i>

535
00:43:25,235 --> 00:43:26,964
<i>People...</i>

536
00:43:28,172 --> 00:43:30,072
should never be alone.

537
00:43:59,336 --> 00:44:00,928
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

538
00:44:02,072 --> 00:44:04,131
<i>I want you to leave your fianc</i>é.

539
00:44:05,609 --> 00:44:07,578
<i>The girl that I love
is</i> <i>in love with him.</i>

540
00:44:07,578 --> 00:44:10,138
<i>- Medical records-</i> <i>The girl
that I love is</i> <i>in love with him.</i>

541
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:13,574
<i>I beg you.</i>

542
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:23,490
Under one condition.

543
00:44:26,397 --> 00:44:27,998
But...

544
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:29,556
But?

545
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:39,102
No, please! Tell me.

546
00:44:50,487 --> 00:44:52,717
I want to take your pictures.

547
00:44:55,859 --> 00:45:01,354
Your medical records said
you don't have much time left.

548
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:07,400
Now, that's an interesting model.

549
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:13,472
I think it'll be fun.

550
00:45:13,677 --> 00:45:16,271
I don't think it'll be fun.

551
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:20,683
Then the deal's off.

552
00:45:24,788 --> 00:45:26,813
Drink up, first!

553
00:45:27,124 --> 00:45:30,787
Give me a drink, too!

554
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:40,768
- Hi! Hi!
- Hi! You're late!

555
00:45:45,342 --> 00:45:49,108
Hello. I spoke to you on the phone.

556
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:51,248
Oh, hi.

557
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:52,510
I'm KANG Chul-kyu.

558
00:45:52,683 --> 00:45:53,945
CHA Joo-hwan.

559
00:45:54,051 --> 00:45:56,485
- Thanks again for that day.
- Anytime.

560
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:58,452
You know him?

561
00:45:58,856 --> 00:46:00,221
The sterilizer?

562
00:46:03,293 --> 00:46:06,063
- Did you eat?
- No, I'll eat now.

563
00:46:06,063 --> 00:46:07,826
Why are you so late?

564
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:10,365
- Still recording a show.
- What?

565
00:46:10,467 --> 00:46:11,935
You said you're done.

566
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:14,460
Not yet. I gotta go back.

567
00:46:17,174 --> 00:46:18,835
- Here.
- Thank you.

568
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:25,077
The song's great.

569
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:27,550
'lf I can live again'?

570
00:46:27,651 --> 00:46:29,710
Of course, I wrote it.

571
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:33,555
Sorry, I gotta run.

572
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:37,617
- Come on.
- Don't go.

573
00:46:37,728 --> 00:46:39,127
I'll see you later.

574
00:46:39,596 --> 00:46:40,722
Bye.

575
00:46:41,365 --> 00:46:44,061
- See you next time, then.
- Sure.

576
00:46:49,373 --> 00:46:50,931
Be careful in the snow!
