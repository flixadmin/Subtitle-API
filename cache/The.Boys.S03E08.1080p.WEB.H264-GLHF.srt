1
00:00:05,965 --> 00:00:08,008
Come on, Earving,
me and the others

2
00:00:08,092 --> 00:00:10,261
have something
to sh-sh-sh-show you.

3
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:21,731
Oh, fuck...

4
00:00:22,982 --> 00:00:24,483
Butcher and Soldier Boy,

5
00:00:24,567 --> 00:00:26,277
where are they?

6
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:30,072
Why do I always have
to take the high road?

7
00:00:30,156 --> 00:00:32,491
M.M., Soldier Boy is
gonna kill more people.

8
00:00:32,575 --> 00:00:35,244
- It wasn't my idea.
- Oh, no, it was Noir's.

9
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:38,456
- What the fuck is this?
- Something we should've done a long time ago.

10
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:39,707
No!

11
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,125
Why the long face, tiger?

12
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,544
You're Homelander.
Button your shit up.

13
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:45,713
I'm proposing a strictly

14
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:47,673
transactional relationship.

15
00:00:47,757 --> 00:00:49,633
Where's Ryan? I'm gonna find him

16
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:51,051
<i>sooner or later.</i>

17
00:00:51,135 --> 00:00:52,428
I hate you.

18
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:54,013
Ready, <i>mon coeur?</i>

19
00:00:56,307 --> 00:00:58,184
Temp V is gonna kill you both.

20
00:00:58,267 --> 00:00:59,267
Jesus Christ.

21
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:00,686
I was just in the lab.

22
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,897
<i>It turns your brain
into fucking Swiss cheese!</i>

23
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,732
You need to tell Hughie.

24
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:06,275
Everything all right?

25
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:08,861
You, me and granny fucker are

26
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:10,196
gonna finish this fucking job.

27
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:11,405
Is this really you?

28
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:12,591
I thought we should have
a conversation.

29
00:01:12,615 --> 00:01:13,699
<i>Vogelbaum made a kid.</i>

30
00:01:13,783 --> 00:01:15,075
<i>Bitch of it is...</i>

31
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:17,870
I'd have let you take
the spotlight.

32
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:19,830
What father wouldn't want that
for his son?

33
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,929
Whoa!

34
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:37,012
I knew your fastball
would come in sooner or later.

35
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,017
- Stay away from him!
- It's okay.

36
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,478
I'm not here to cause trouble,
hurt anyone.

37
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:45,022
Just want to see my son.

38
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,817
And I had a heck of a time
trying to find you, buddy, I...

39
00:01:49,193 --> 00:01:51,111
Even had to get

40
00:01:51,195 --> 00:01:53,823
a big, important congresswoman
to help me.

41
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:56,450
She been treating you all right?

42
00:01:56,534 --> 00:01:58,577
Aunt Grace?

43
00:01:58,661 --> 00:02:00,996
Yeah, she's nice.

44
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,998
"Aunt Grace."

45
00:02:03,082 --> 00:02:05,084
Okay.

46
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:08,963
You know,
she may be nice, Ryan, but

47
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:10,631
she's not your aunt.

48
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:13,551
She's not even your real family.

49
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:15,553
I can hear those clumsy fingers

50
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:17,972
of yours slipping around
on that screen.

51
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:20,140
Get rid of it now.

52
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:29,108
Listen, Ryan.

53
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:31,819
Your mom, she wanted
what's best for you.

54
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:33,654
And so do I.

55
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:35,906
You have a real family.

56
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,118
But aren't you mad at me?

57
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:43,080
For what I did?

58
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,708
You know it wasn't
your fault, right?

59
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:55,634
Son, when you're
as strong as we are,

60
00:02:55,718 --> 00:02:59,263
accidents happen,
uh, things break...

61
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:01,307
and sometimes they are

62
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,350
the things
that you love the most.

63
00:03:03,434 --> 00:03:06,979
But-but that's all it is:
an accident.

64
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:10,274
And nobody on this earth
knows that better than me.

65
00:03:11,734 --> 00:03:13,736
Nobody.

66
00:03:14,737 --> 00:03:16,363
That why I'm always
gonna love you.

67
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:20,492
No matter what happens,
no matter...

68
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:22,995
what you do.

69
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:25,205
I'm not going anywhere.

70
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:27,666
I will always be here.

71
00:03:38,177 --> 00:03:41,889
Homelander admitted
on video he locked up Maeve!

72
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:43,891
Bullshit!

73
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:48,145
Well, great news!

74
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,147
We just heard
the attorney general's office

75
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,857
has a search warrant,

76
00:03:51,941 --> 00:03:54,777
and they're coming here
to free Maeve!

77
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,154
Free Maeve! Free Maeve!

78
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,239
Starlight lies! Children die!

79
00:03:59,323 --> 00:04:01,659
Starlight lies!
Children die!

80
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:06,413
I really think we should've
waited for Homelander.

81
00:04:06,497 --> 00:04:08,040
Well, I don't know where he is.
Do you?

82
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:10,226
But I do know the attorney
general is an attention whore

83
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,044
who loves to be on Don Lemon.

84
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:14,272
And she's on her way here
right now with a search warrant

85
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:17,007
to look for her.

86
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:49,748
Where's Soldier Boy?

87
00:04:49,832 --> 00:04:51,667
You mean, ever since he told us

88
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,419
he was supposed
to kill his own son?

89
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:55,045
He locked himself
in the bathroom

90
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:56,839
with a bottle of Old Granddad.

91
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:59,717
Well, Homelander ain't really
his son, and he knows it.

92
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:05,055
All right,
let's be off then, eh?

93
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:07,474
We'll swing by the office
and grab some more V.

94
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:10,227
And then Hughie will jump us
to where the cunts are.

95
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,146
We do Noir

96
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:14,982
and Homelander.

97
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:16,775
And we're finished.

98
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:18,027
Right?

99
00:05:59,485 --> 00:06:01,278
Bonjour.

100
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,988
I got you something.

101
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:10,871
- Voilà.
- Fuck is that?

102
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:13,832
Oh, this is it.

103
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,918
Cost three Bugattis-worth
of Starlight's

104
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,003
money, but...

105
00:06:19,088 --> 00:06:20,881
A dose of Novichok.

106
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:22,674
Our weapon against Soldier Boy.

107
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:24,968
And the only fucking dose
on the eastern seaboard.

108
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:28,013
You put the world's
deadliest nerve agent

109
00:06:28,097 --> 00:06:31,809
in a ten-dollar bottle
of Starlight's Wish?

110
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,644
I must say,
the smell has improved.

111
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:36,647
Great.

112
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:45,948
So you lost your temper
and hit a man.

113
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:48,325
Oh, this is nothing.

114
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,993
You know, I once took
a Spaniard's ear

115
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:52,287
for jabbering at a screening
of <i>27 Dresses...</i>

116
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:55,124
Frenchie, my whole point
has always been

117
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:57,209
to keep my fucked-up shit

118
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:59,503
away from Janine.

119
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:02,673
I lost control for one second,

120
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:05,217
and for the rest of her life,

121
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,427
she's gonna have
an image of her daddy

122
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:09,805
beating up her stepfather.

123
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:11,849
I got to lock my shit down.

124
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,684
I got to be stronger.

125
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,853
Out of all man's miseries,

126
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,771
the most bitter is this.

127
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:19,982
To know so much...

128
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:21,608
And to control so little.

129
00:07:21,692 --> 00:07:23,443
I've read a fucking book,
all right?

130
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:25,505
You cannot keep the truth
from your daughter that...

131
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:27,197
that you are...

132
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:29,283
a deeply...

133
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:32,327
broken and fucked-up man.

134
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,373
So am I.

135
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,083
So are we all, no?

136
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:40,127
But you're also,
perhaps, the best man

137
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,462
I ever known.

138
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:45,674
Let Janine see all of it.

139
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:53,265
And get back
on the fucking Lexapro.

140
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:56,727
{\an8}<i>Homelander's shocking admissions

- Hey!

144
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:04,193
There you are.

145
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:06,111
Where were you?

146
00:08:06,195 --> 00:08:08,113
What do you want?

147
00:08:08,197 --> 00:08:09,406
- Come with me.
- I'm walking.

148
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,908
Um...

149
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:12,826
so...

150
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,661

Deep and I

152
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:17,915
had to move

153
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:19,726
- Maeve out of the Tower.
- That was your idea.

154
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,251
You were there.

155
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:38,227
- We didn't have a choice.
- Okay.

156
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,330
- There was a search warrant.
- I wanted to wait for you, Homelander.

157
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:42,248
- But she insisted.
- Can you just shut the fuck up?

158
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:43,607
Where is Maeve now?

159
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:48,487
Noir, hey.

160
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,155
Bro.

161
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,453
We're just gonna...
we're gonna go.

162
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,996
Yeah. This... Okay.

163
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,249
Talk to you guys later.

164
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:25,232
Let's fuck up Soldier Boy.

165
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,034
I knew you'd come back.

166
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,802
Hey, uh...

167
00:09:56,972 --> 00:10:00,100
You really are the spitting
image of my little brother.

168
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:01,977
What?

169
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:18,535
- Oh, there he is.
- Where's the cum guzzler?

170
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,013
You were spot-on about him.

171
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:21,913
There I was,
filling up the motor,

172
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:23,599
I turn around, the little git
had done a runner.

173
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,500
We needed him to get near Noir.

174
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:27,384
Ah, don't you worry
about that, guv.

175
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:29,504
I got it all worked out.

176
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:38,513
Wake me when we get to New York.

177
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,446
Need a hand?

178
00:10:58,742 --> 00:11:01,411
More in the market
for some legs.

179
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:09,252
- What happened to you?
- You'll never believe it.

180
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:10,921
They gave me a new ticker.

181
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,964
I'm gonna be able to run again.

182
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:18,762
All the races
and the endorsements.

183
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:22,766
I'm about to get it all back.

184
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:30,607
But it don't mean shit
without you.

185
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,443
I need you.

186
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:35,237
Come coach me
and you can still work

187
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,197
with the kids
at the broke-ass school.

188
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,408
Hell, you'll make enough
to fix the damn place up.

189
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:45,997
I'm really fucking sorry, Nate.

190
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:48,542
I'll spend the rest
of my life making it up to you.

191
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:54,005
Did you kill Blue Hawk?

192
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:55,507
What?

193
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:58,677
No, that was...

194
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,178
Soldier Boy.

195
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:03,348
Hmm.

196
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:04,850
You did.

197
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:06,852
- No, Nate...
- I didn't want that!

198
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:09,604
I wanted my kids to see
his mugshot on the TV.

199
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:11,690
And now he's...

200
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:13,775
- Fuck!
- I stopped him.

201
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:16,194
For you.

202
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:17,988
Don't say you did that for me.

203
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,824
You've only ever been
about yourself.

204
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:23,201
- I'm sorry. I'll make it right.
- How?!

205
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:25,287
Every time you try,
you make it worse.

206
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:29,791
Reggie, just-just go, man.

207
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,585
Just go, just get out, okay?

208
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:33,795
Go sell your menthol vapes

209
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:36,256
and your fast cash shops
and all of that.

210
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:38,175
But just stay out of my life!

211
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,801
Nate.

212
00:12:39,885 --> 00:12:40,927
Come on, man.

213
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:43,388
I said get
the fuck out of my house!

214
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:46,641
I don't want a murderer
in the same house with my kids!

215
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:48,351
- Shit!
- Nate, I'm sorry.

216
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:50,604
- Shit, Nate...
- Don't touch me!

217
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,940
Don't come back here.

218
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,887
Thanks for picking me up.

219
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:27,098
Sure you want to tell me
to go fuck myself.

220
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:29,059
I'm not saying anything.

221
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,353
'Cause if you did want
to say that,

222
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:33,230
I mean, you could.

223
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:37,400
What happened?

224
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:39,152
Uh... Butcher.

225
00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:41,196
Just out of nowhere,
knocked me out.

226
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,281
Did he tell you?

227
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:45,492
Tell me what?

228
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:47,827
That Temp V is fatal.

229
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:52,123
If you shot up any more, you'd
probably be dead right now.

230
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:54,501
Oh, my fucking God,
he didn't tell you!

231
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:56,503
- That asshole!
- Saved my life.

232
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:58,463
Saved your life?

233
00:13:58,547 --> 00:14:00,715
It looks like he gave you
a concussion.

234
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:03,093
He stopped me
from taking more V.

235
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:08,765
H-Have you ever had Pizza Rolls?

236
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:13,603
Like... middle school sleepover

237
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:15,188
Pizza Rolls?

238
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:18,900
Yeah, Dad bought them in bulk
after Mom left.

239
00:14:18,984 --> 00:14:21,111
Every night,
we'd have Pizza Rolls,

240
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,488
watch <i>Remington Steele...</i>

241
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:26,074
try not to touch
her spot on the couch.

242
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:29,035
And he never fought back
for her or anything.

243
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:32,038
Just sat there
eating Pizza Rolls.

244
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:35,125
I spent so much time
thinking he was...

245
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,294
sad and-and weak.

246
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,129
Just a loser.

247
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:41,923
But you know what? Dad...

248
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:44,217
was there.

249
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:46,469
Taking care of me
during-during the worst days

250
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:48,353
of his life, just trying
to keep the lights on

251
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,181
and a...

252
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:51,850
...and a roof above our heads.

253
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:56,313
He wasn't weak.

254
00:14:58,273 --> 00:15:00,609
I just, I-I didn't know

255
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:03,069
what strength was.

256
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:06,906
Annie, I'm-I'm so sorry.

257
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:09,367
I've been an asshole.

258
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:11,411
I never should have...

259
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:13,663
I-I never should've put
any of this onto you.

260
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,585
Thank you for saying that.

261
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,674
Literally every neuron
in your brain

262
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:26,736
is screaming "I told you so,"
so why don't you just say it

263
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,470
- before your head explodes.
- Oh, my God!

264
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:32,265
- I fucking told you so.
- Feel good to get that out?

265
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:34,149
So satisfying. Oh, my God.

266
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:39,481
Hello?

267
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:42,400
Oh, my God, where are you?

268
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,246
Hey.

269
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:56,915
Hey, Maeve.

270
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:58,500
Good to see you again.

271
00:15:58,583 --> 00:15:59,668
Glad you're okay.

272
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:01,461
It's like you wear a neon sign

273
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:03,463
that says,
"Raw dog me, I'm a bottom."

274
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:06,174
- I'm gonna, I'm gonna let you two catch up.
- Me, too.

275
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,262
Where were you?

276
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:14,349
About 12 floors
below you in the Tower

277
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:16,810
- this whole time.
- How did you get out?

278
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,812
Your #Free Maeve shit

279
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:21,314
had every LGB-teen in the world

280
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:23,817
up Vought's ass.

281
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,652
You got me my chance.

282
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,666
You know what would've
been better, though?

283
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:31,032
Actually busting me out.

284
00:16:31,116 --> 00:16:32,909
I think that would've been
way harder.

285
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,709
<i>Merde!</i> That hurt.

286
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:44,879
You've been drowning yourself in this shit

287
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:45,964
since Little Nina.

288
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:47,090
I have done my part.

289
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:50,218
- We're not finished, asshole.
- Yeah, I am.

290
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:53,805
- Asshole!
- Nina was right.

291
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:55,932
My papa, he put
a chain around my neck.

292
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,559
And all that fucking changes

293
00:16:57,642 --> 00:16:59,269
is who holds the other end.

294
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:10,655
Our past is not who we are.

295
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:13,908
I thought I'd always be broken.

296
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:19,622
But you saw something in me.

297
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:26,504
I see it in you.

298
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:29,883
What do you see?

299
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:34,220
I see <i>mon coeur.</i>

300
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:40,059
Soldier Boy is Homelander's
fucking what?

301
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:41,686
Homelander's father.

302
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,354
Biologically, at least.

303
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:45,273
So put them in a room together,

304
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:48,067
- are they gonna fight or fucking hug?
- We don't know.

305
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:50,069
Soldier Boy's been, uh, weird.

306
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:51,881
- But Butcher...
- If there's a snowball's chance

307
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:55,033
that Butcher can take down
Homelander, he's gonna take it.

308
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:57,535
I don't care what
your orders are, I'm Starlight,

309
00:17:57,619 --> 00:18:01,164
and I'm telling you that you
need to evacuate the Tower now.

310
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:04,125
Because Soldier Boy is
alive and he's real,

311
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:07,378
and he's gonna f... oh, fucking,
you fucking stupid...

312
00:18:07,462 --> 00:18:08,963
Fuck.

313
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:12,133
There are a couple thousand
people in that building.

314
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:15,178
I mean, if he pulls a Herogasm,

315
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:17,096
he's gonna take
the whole fucking place down.

316
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:20,433
Then we take down Soldier Boy
before he gets to Homelander.

317
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:22,852
And save Butcher.

318
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:27,065
Y'all two fuck us over,

319
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:29,067
and now you want to be
Motherfucking Theresa?

320
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,819
I know.

321
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:32,379
- And-and I'm sorry...
- Hughie.

322
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:33,947
Some people are
just past saving.

323
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,070
He don't want to be saved.

324
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,032
He could've dragged me

325
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,033
down with him, but he didn't.

326
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,993
There's still something good.

327
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:41,037
Deep, deep...

328
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:44,707
- ...deep inside.
- Balls deep.

329
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:48,294
Perhaps.

330
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:49,462
Bonjour, Petit Hughie.

331
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:50,880
We save everyone.

332
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:53,258
Even if they don't deserve it.

333
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:56,010
Especially
if they don't deserve it.

334
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:06,646
Whoa... that brings me back.

335
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:10,275
Used to sneak
my dad's Manhattans

336
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:11,818
when I was a kid.

337
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:13,921
I didn't have
to nick nothin' from my old man.

338
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:15,465
He used to get me
and me little brother

339
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,949
lagered just for the hell of it.

340
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:20,076
Well, I got to admit,
that does sound funny.

341
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:24,581
- The old man still around?
- Arse cancer.

342
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:29,043
Shitting his guts out
as we speak, one hopes.

343
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:34,841
You ever see
<i>The Soldier Boy Story?</i>

344
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:37,010
- Must've missed it.
- It's a classic.

345
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:39,846
We lost Best Picture to
<i>An American in Paris</i> that year.

346
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,547
At least I got to ass-fuck
Jane Wyman in the coat check.

347
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:47,520
About a poor kid from
the streets of South Philly.

348
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:50,607
Discovers he's got

349
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,984
incredible powers
to match his...

350
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:55,069
heart of gold.

351
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,739
It's all bullshit.

352
00:19:57,822 --> 00:19:59,574
Blimey, you don't say?

353
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:02,410
Actually my father owned half
the steel mills in the state.

354
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:04,579
I went to boarding school.

355
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:07,040
Got kicked out
of boarding school.

356
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:09,417
Because I was a fuck-up.

357
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,421
But he made sure I knew it.

358
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:14,797
Use the belt, did he?

359
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:16,361
Never laid a hand on me.

360
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:18,426
He couldn't be bothered.

361
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:22,263
Said I was a disappointment.

362
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:25,808
Not good enough
to carry his name.

363
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:31,272
So I went to his golf buddies
in the War Department,

364
00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:33,149
and they get me
into Dr. Vought's

365
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,068
Compound V trials.

366
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:36,778
I became a superhero.

367
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:39,280
Strongest man alive.
Fucking ticker tape parades

368
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:40,657
when I came home.

369
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,450
And what did
the old man say then?

370
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:44,535
Ah.

371
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:50,541
He said I took a shortcut.

372
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:57,715
That a real man
wouldn't have cheated.

373
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:06,849
Mm.

374
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:08,935
What about you, you got kids?

375
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:10,937
It's complicated.

376
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,481
I always assumed
I had a few out there.

377
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:15,566
Somewhere.

378
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:19,988
I always wanted 'em.

379
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:24,659
'Cause I thought I could do it
better than my father did.

380
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:26,995
Homelander ain't yours.

381
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:28,705
Not really.

382
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:31,624
- He's the only blood I've got left.
- It don't matter.

383
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,876
You didn't name him,
didn't raise him.

384
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,878
Vought grew him

385
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:38,256
in a fucking test tube
to take your place.

386
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:41,759
He's the fucking reason they
left you to rot with the Ivans.

387
00:21:41,843 --> 00:21:43,928
Look, mate.

388
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:48,975
We had a deal.

389
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:03,781
I'm gonna get some air.

390
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:20,465
Sharpen it for a thousand hours,

391
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:22,633
still won't cut
Soldier Boy's skin.

392
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:31,517
So... you were on his team.

393
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:33,352
You knew him.

394
00:22:34,604 --> 00:22:36,856
What was he like?

395
00:22:42,195 --> 00:22:43,946
Come on.

396
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,656
Nobody's all bad.

397
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:54,832
He's my father.

398
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:56,918
I didn't believe him at first.

399
00:22:57,001 --> 00:22:59,128
I ripped apart
the company archives,

400
00:22:59,212 --> 00:23:01,130
and... it's true.

401
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:05,468
It's true.

402
00:23:07,512 --> 00:23:09,847
They lied to me my whole life.

403
00:23:11,224 --> 00:23:13,226
Surprise.

404
00:23:14,685 --> 00:23:17,688
Thing I needed most as a kid
and they kept it from me.

405
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,152
Now, well, I...

406
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:28,074
I'm not sure I want to.

407
00:23:29,951 --> 00:23:32,829
It's funny, you know, everyone
thinks of you as this, uh...

408
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:35,540
unreadable sphinx.

409
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:38,209
A mystery.

410
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:40,253
Not me. I see through

411
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:42,713
that mask.

412
00:23:42,797 --> 00:23:45,133
I mean, literally,
I can see your face.

413
00:23:45,216 --> 00:23:47,135
Your battle scars.

414
00:23:47,218 --> 00:23:49,804
The crooked old smile of yours.

415
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:52,265
I know when you're happy,

416
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:55,017
sad, telling the truth.

417
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:57,311
Lying.

418
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:02,692
Did you know?

419
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:04,777
That I had a father out there?

420
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,156
Alive this whole time?

421
00:24:25,673 --> 00:24:27,633
Fuck.

422
00:24:29,844 --> 00:24:31,804
Why didn't you tell me?

423
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:10,927
You should've told me.

424
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:21,354
Oh...

425
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:26,192
D-D-Don't worry, Earving.

426
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:28,903
We are so proud of you.

427
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:33,741
Soon you'll be
in the sweet embrace

428
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:36,327
of C-C-C...

429
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,663
Christ the Lord!

430
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:03,813
Fuck me.

431
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:05,189
I figured you was dead.

432
00:26:05,273 --> 00:26:07,900
You didn't think I knew
where the blind spots

433
00:26:07,984 --> 00:26:09,318
were, motherfucker?

434
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:10,486
Back up.

435
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:14,781
Where's Soldier Boy?

436
00:26:14,824 --> 00:26:17,076
You on that Temp V shit,
Butcher, huh?

437
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:19,954
What happens
if I pull this trigger?

438
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:21,664
Go on, do it.

439
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:22,999
Hey, M.M., M.M, stop.

440
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,875
M.M.!

441
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:27,837
If Soldier Boy goes through
with this, thousands will die.

442
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,463
Help us stop him.

443
00:26:29,547 --> 00:26:31,147
This ain't a bloody kinder care

444
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:32,383
we're on about, son.

445
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:34,135
Its Vought fucking Tower.

446
00:26:34,218 --> 00:26:35,553
Becca worked in the Tower.

447
00:26:35,636 --> 00:26:37,555
You shut your fucking
cake hole, Frenchie.

448
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:40,808
No.

449
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:42,601
No!

450
00:26:43,853 --> 00:26:46,022
No, my cake hole

451
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:47,898
will remain open!

452
00:26:47,982 --> 00:26:51,152
You will never command me again.

453
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:53,422
- I am done with your cruelty.
- Okay, Frenchie...

454
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:54,780
I deserve respect!

455
00:26:54,864 --> 00:26:58,117
And we all deserve paid vacation
days, and a dental plan!

456
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,578
We-we-we heard you.

457
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:04,373
You could've let me die
from the V, but you saved me.

458
00:27:04,457 --> 00:27:07,585
In the shittiest way possible,
but still.

459
00:27:09,462 --> 00:27:11,339
I don't think
you want to do this.

460
00:27:11,422 --> 00:27:14,633
I think you want me
to pull you back.

461
00:27:14,717 --> 00:27:16,344
Like Lenny used to.

462
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:24,268
- Maeve, no!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

463
00:27:26,354 --> 00:27:28,564
Butcher's right.
Homelander needs to die.

464
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,941
That's it. Whatever it takes.

465
00:27:31,025 --> 00:27:34,570
I really thought
that deep down you were a hero.

466
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,781
Well, you were wrong.

467
00:27:36,864 --> 00:27:38,783
There's no such thing.

468
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:41,202
This is not gonna happen.

469
00:27:42,203 --> 00:27:44,330
Annie, I don't want to hurt you.

470
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:46,290
But I will.

471
00:27:49,543 --> 00:27:51,337
All right, you lot.

472
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,630
In the safe.

473
00:27:52,713 --> 00:27:54,423
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.

474
00:27:56,967 --> 00:27:59,762
In the safe.

475
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:06,185
Let's go.

476
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:08,938
Hey, not now.

477
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:10,564
Not like this.

478
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:26,831
All right, well...

479
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:29,417
Tinkerbell needs power
for her powers.

480
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:33,546
<i>I'm Starlight and
I'm telling you that you need</i>

481
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:35,923
<i>- to evacuate the Tower now.
- Why?</i>

482
00:28:36,006 --> 00:28:38,259
<i>Because Soldier Boy is
alive and he...</i>

483
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:40,261
We ran it through the voice
thing-a-ma-bob.

484
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:42,221
It's really her, so, you know,

485
00:28:42,304 --> 00:28:43,698
I think we should
probably evacuate.

486
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,391
Nobody's evacuating anything.

487
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:47,226
We have to project strength.

488
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:48,978
Right.

489
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:50,646
No, that's smart. Strength.

490
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:53,315
Okay, so my Angel Fish...
That's what I call Analytics...

491
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:55,151
We think Soldier Boy's
coming for Noir,

492
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:57,194
last member of Payback, right?

493
00:28:57,278 --> 00:28:59,029
So we should use Noir as bait.

494
00:28:59,113 --> 00:29:01,153
And that way it draws
Soldier Boy directly to the...

495
00:29:08,164 --> 00:29:11,333
Hey, is everything,
is everything okay with Noir?

496
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:13,127
He was keeping secrets from me.

497
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:15,783
You know, when the company first

498
00:29:15,838 --> 00:29:17,339
rolled me out in front
of the cameras,

499
00:29:17,423 --> 00:29:19,049
they told me...

500
00:29:19,133 --> 00:29:21,135
I was gonna get
my very own team.

501
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:23,304
I wanted so badly for that team

502
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:25,681
to be the family
that I never got.

503
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:28,767
And then I got you.

504
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:32,354
I've, I've always
tried to help, sir.

505
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:34,815
What, like when you ran away
from Herogasm?

506
00:29:34,899 --> 00:29:36,734
Or maybe
when you fucked an octopus?

507
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,946
You really want to help?

508
00:29:56,504 --> 00:29:58,422
Sir...

509
00:30:00,049 --> 00:30:01,675
That's sort of treason.

510
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:03,844
Big word.

511
00:30:05,638 --> 00:30:07,806
Anything you need, Homelander.

512
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:09,266
Sir.

513
00:30:10,768 --> 00:30:13,562
Ashley, take off that wig.

514
00:30:13,646 --> 00:30:16,190
What wig?

515
00:30:32,623 --> 00:30:35,167
Hmm.

516
00:30:35,251 --> 00:30:36,919
And then there's you.

517
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:40,130
How could you kill
one of your own kind

518
00:30:40,214 --> 00:30:41,757
in cold blood?

519
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,884
You are going to tell the world

520
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:47,846
that we are the one and only

521
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:49,932
true justice.

522
00:30:52,726 --> 00:30:56,021
Noir was worth more
than all of you put together.

523
00:30:58,232 --> 00:31:00,401
You're not my family.

524
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:02,903
I don't need any of you.

525
00:31:02,987 --> 00:31:05,406
Remember that.

526
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:13,622
On the record?

527
00:31:13,706 --> 00:31:16,667
If Dakota Bob taps me for VP,
I'd be honored.

528
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,836
Off the record?

529
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:21,171
I'm expecting good news
at the Prayer Breakfast.

530
00:31:57,374 --> 00:31:58,709
Fuck.

531
00:32:05,049 --> 00:32:06,383
Ooh.

532
00:32:06,467 --> 00:32:09,178
They got a really big
head start, but...

533
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:10,261
I know a way in.

534
00:32:10,304 --> 00:32:11,680
Then what?

535
00:32:11,764 --> 00:32:12,866
'Cause from where I'm standing,

536
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:14,683
we're fucked with no grease.

537
00:32:14,767 --> 00:32:16,685
No plan and no knockout gas.

538
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:18,496
- Where do we get some more?
- We don't.

539
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,105
That was the only one.

540
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:26,445
There is one lab in New York...

541
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:30,074
...that might be stocked
with the things I need.

542
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:32,242
And as fate would have it,
we are headed there, so...

543
00:32:32,326 --> 00:32:34,888
- You're joking.
- We're gonna break into Vought Tower, while you go

544
00:32:34,912 --> 00:32:36,705
to the lab
crawling with armed guards

545
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:37,873
and you're gonna cook up

546
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,392
the world's
most dangerous neurotoxin

547
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:40,918
with, what, a little moxie

548
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:43,295
and a little
Mr. Wizard know-how

549
00:32:43,379 --> 00:32:47,633
while we hold off
Homelander and Soldier Boy?

550
00:32:47,716 --> 00:32:49,802
Uh... <i>oui.</i>

551
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:55,724
It's good enough for me.

552
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:57,476
Hmm.

553
00:32:57,559 --> 00:32:58,559
Me, too.

554
00:33:03,774 --> 00:33:04,900
Monsieur Lait de Mère?

555
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:07,444
The most important shit
of my life,

556
00:33:07,528 --> 00:33:11,031
and I'm counting on
coked-out Eurotrash.

557
00:33:15,411 --> 00:33:16,745
Shit's baffling.

558
00:33:37,975 --> 00:33:39,815
<i>The prisoners
you liberated here,</i>

559
00:33:39,893 --> 00:33:41,311
<i>most of them were nearly dead.</i>

560
00:33:41,395 --> 00:33:42,771
<i>They owe you their lives.</i>

561
00:33:42,855 --> 00:33:44,440
<i>I'm not here to take credit.</i>

562
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:46,275
<i>These boys here,
they're the real heroes.</i>

563
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:48,610
<i>What the Jerries did here
is unforgivable.</i>

564
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:51,113
<i>But I promise you,
I'm gonna serve them up</i>

565
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:53,782
<i>some good old-fashioned
American justice.</i>

566
00:33:53,866 --> 00:33:56,034
Scorched earth, eh, William?

567
00:33:56,118 --> 00:33:57,995
Scorched earth.

568
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:04,460
Where's Noir?

569
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:10,007
He's dead.

570
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:13,135
I killed him.

571
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:15,095
Why?

572
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:17,139
Because he didn't tell me
about you.

573
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,018
I'm alone.

574
00:34:22,853 --> 00:34:24,396
I just want to talk.

575
00:34:26,023 --> 00:34:27,691
I know what it's like
to have your team

576
00:34:27,775 --> 00:34:29,693
betray you.

577
00:34:29,777 --> 00:34:32,654
But with you and I together...

578
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:35,783
...they wouldn't stand a chance.
Nobody would.

579
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:42,956
Unless we kill each other first.

580
00:34:45,042 --> 00:34:46,376
That's true.
But why?

581
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,003
What, because he says so?

582
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,505
He's nothing.

583
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:50,881
He's human.

584
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:53,258
Don't you listen
to this fucking twat.

585
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:55,177
He ain't your kid.

586
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,303
Yes, I am.

587
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:57,304
I am your son.

588
00:34:57,387 --> 00:34:59,515
I am your blood.

589
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:01,391
That's all that matters.

590
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:03,977
Maybe.

591
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:16,239
Ryan.

592
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:20,285
This is my son.
Ryan.

593
00:35:20,369 --> 00:35:21,370
Your grandson.

594
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:24,581
Hi, Grandpa.

595
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:27,292
You see?

596
00:35:27,376 --> 00:35:29,169
You have a family.

597
00:35:29,253 --> 00:35:30,546
You have him.

598
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:34,508
And you have me.

599
00:35:40,973 --> 00:35:43,433
It's a shame that I've missed...

600
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:45,434
...so much.

601
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:48,605
I wish I could've raised you...

602
00:35:48,689 --> 00:35:49,690
...and taught you,

603
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:51,108
father to son.

604
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:52,526
Me too.

605
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:53,777
That's okay.

606
00:35:53,861 --> 00:35:55,279
We're not alone anymore.

607
00:35:55,362 --> 00:35:56,655
We have each other.

608
00:36:00,534 --> 00:36:03,370
Maybe if I'd raised you...

609
00:36:04,371 --> 00:36:06,081
...I could've made you better.

610
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:10,794
And not some weak,

611
00:36:10,878 --> 00:36:12,713
sniveling pussy,

612
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:15,382
starved for attention.

613
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:18,760
But there's no fixing that now.

614
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:20,512
Weak?

615
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:22,890
I'm you.

616
00:36:22,973 --> 00:36:24,516
I know.

617
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:29,021
You're a fucking disappointment.

618
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:30,647
Leave him alone!

619
00:36:30,731 --> 00:36:33,191
- Get out of here, Ryan!
- Please, stop!

620
00:36:33,275 --> 00:36:34,836
- Get out of the building! Now!
- Butcher, stop!

621
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,194
- Please!
- You can't.

622
00:36:36,278 --> 00:36:38,071
- You can't do this.
- Stop! Please!

623
00:36:38,155 --> 00:36:39,448
Don't do this.

624
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:41,992
Don't do this. Don't.

625
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:48,457
Ryan, get back upstairs.

626
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,708
Right now.

627
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,253
Ryan!

628
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,093
You little shit.

629
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:12,105
Ryan.

630
00:37:12,189 --> 00:37:13,649
Hey.

631
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:41,301
What the fuck are you doing?

632
00:37:41,385 --> 00:37:42,511
Not the kid.

633
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:43,863
Oh, I thought you said
blood didn't matter.

634
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:45,448
Thought that was
the whole fucking point.

635
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:46,473
He's my wife's son.

636
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:51,561
Wait, Homelander
fucked your wife?

637
00:37:51,645 --> 00:37:53,313
And you want to save the brat?

638
00:37:53,397 --> 00:37:55,315
The hell's wrong with you?

639
00:37:55,399 --> 00:37:57,109
I made a promise.

640
00:37:57,192 --> 00:37:58,777
So this is it.

641
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:02,030
Everything you wanted...
He's right fucking there...

642
00:38:02,114 --> 00:38:03,198
And now you blink?

643
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,324
Stand down.

644
00:38:04,408 --> 00:38:05,659
Fuck you.

645
00:38:08,245 --> 00:38:09,538
You're weaker than he is.

646
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:14,584
Hey.

647
00:38:14,668 --> 00:38:16,545
Dad.

648
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:17,921
Yeah. I'm right here.

649
00:38:18,005 --> 00:38:19,589
You're okay.

650
00:38:26,847 --> 00:38:28,098
Hey, asshole.

651
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:32,787
Not now, Maeve.
We have bigger fish.

652
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:34,730
I don't.

653
00:38:36,857 --> 00:38:38,025
I said not now.

654
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:47,534
Maeve, stop.

655
00:38:47,617 --> 00:38:49,202
Maeve...

656
00:39:39,753 --> 00:39:41,671
<i>C'est le paradis.</i>

657
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:49,572
<i>Testing, testing, testing.</i>

658
00:39:49,596 --> 00:39:52,724
Okay, that's loud. Uh...

659
00:39:52,808 --> 00:39:54,285
<i>Attention. There has been
a terrorist threat</i>

660
00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:55,578
<i>Called into the building.</i>

661
00:39:55,602 --> 00:39:57,729
<i>Please leave
as quickly as you can.</i>

662
00:39:57,813 --> 00:40:00,315
This is not a drill,
this is not this is not a test.

663
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,043
<i>- Please evacuate quickly.</i>
- Where are you going, Ashley?

664
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:03,693
With you, Ashley.
To the helipad?

665
00:40:03,777 --> 00:40:06,404
Yeah. So, the Sikorsky's
actually reserved

666
00:40:06,488 --> 00:40:08,740
for SVPs and higher.

667
00:40:08,824 --> 00:40:11,076
<i>Do not trample anyone
on the way out.</i>

668
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:12,869
Sorry, Ashley.

669
00:40:12,953 --> 00:40:15,038
<i>Leave as quickly
as you can. Thank you.</i>

670
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:32,806
Freeze! Show us your hands!

671
00:41:14,014 --> 00:41:17,601
Aah! Aah!

672
00:41:17,684 --> 00:41:20,604
Aw, fuck!

673
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:01,519
Aah!

674
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:19,746
I've got the Novichok. Huh?

675
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:25,919
Now... go.

676
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:30,924
Aah!

677
00:42:32,759 --> 00:42:35,011
Yeah! Fuck your shield, bitch.

678
00:43:16,886 --> 00:43:18,221
Oh, no.

679
00:43:18,305 --> 00:43:20,181
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

680
00:43:20,265 --> 00:43:21,850
No.

681
00:44:38,093 --> 00:44:39,302
You ain't no hero.

682
00:44:39,386 --> 00:44:41,930
You're just another racist
piece of shit

683
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:42,931
we can't seem to get rid of.

684
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:44,724
This is for my family.

685
00:44:59,781 --> 00:45:01,908
I'm not going back

686
00:45:01,991 --> 00:45:04,702
in that fucking box!

687
00:45:04,786 --> 00:45:06,121
You'll kill everyone.

688
00:45:42,031 --> 00:45:43,241
Shit.

689
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:39,839
Are you hurt?

690
00:46:39,923 --> 00:46:42,300
Ryan, look at me.

691
00:47:02,946 --> 00:47:04,572
Dad...

692
00:47:06,241 --> 00:47:08,284
I want to go.

693
00:47:12,205 --> 00:47:15,500
Let's leave. Please.

694
00:47:15,583 --> 00:47:16,876
I want to leave.

695
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,753
Ryan.

696
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:29,097
Please.

697
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:11,389
{\an8}<i>Greatest superheroes.</i>

698

{\an8}<i>A role model for
little girls everywhere.</i>

699
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:16,603
{\an8}<i>A strong, proud lesbian

703
00:48:21,691 --> 00:48:23,818
{\an8}<i>when she stopped Russian-
radicalized Soldier Boy</i>

704
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:24,944
{\an8}<i>and saved us all.</i>

705
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,870
We drained the fluid, but, uh...

706
00:48:33,953 --> 00:48:36,539
Mr. Butcher?

707
00:48:36,623 --> 00:48:38,166
- Sorry.
- Attempting further treatment

708
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:40,335
would significantly impact

709
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:42,503
your quality of life without

710
00:48:42,587 --> 00:48:45,173
necessarily extending
the time you have.

711
00:48:48,384 --> 00:48:50,219
Uh, sir, no smoking.

712
00:48:50,303 --> 00:48:51,846
Uh...

713
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:54,974
- How long I got?
- Months.

714
00:48:55,058 --> 00:48:58,102
Twelve.
Eighteen, on the outside.

715
00:49:05,526 --> 00:49:06,944
Hmm.

716
00:49:07,028 --> 00:49:09,238
Well...

717
00:49:09,322 --> 00:49:11,324
you can kindly fuck off, then.

718
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:24,879
You know, for
the longest time, Janine, I...

719
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:27,799
I didn't want to
bring you into this.

720
00:49:29,592 --> 00:49:31,594
But you know what?

721
00:49:32,845 --> 00:49:34,639
There's nothing
to be ashamed of.

722
00:49:34,722 --> 00:49:37,475
Truth is,

723
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:39,560
superheroes aren't always good.

724
00:49:40,645 --> 00:49:43,022
One of them, Soldier Boy...

725
00:49:44,482 --> 00:49:47,318
...killed a lot of our family
members a long time ago.

726
00:49:50,613 --> 00:49:53,282
It makes me sad.

727
00:49:53,366 --> 00:49:57,036
Sometimes it makes me mad
when I think about it.

728
00:50:02,083 --> 00:50:05,002
But...

729
00:50:05,086 --> 00:50:06,713
Your granddaddy,

730
00:50:06,796 --> 00:50:09,215
he spent his entire life

731
00:50:09,298 --> 00:50:11,509
fighting to get justice.

732
00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:16,180
And now I do, too.

733
00:50:16,264 --> 00:50:20,101
I just want you to know
that you should be proud.

734
00:50:20,184 --> 00:50:22,061
Your granddaddy...

735
00:50:22,145 --> 00:50:24,480
Now, he was a real hero.

736
00:50:27,567 --> 00:50:29,569
You're my hero, Daddy.

737
00:50:31,988 --> 00:50:33,948
Thank you.

738
00:50:40,163 --> 00:50:41,456
Hello?

739
00:50:42,623 --> 00:50:44,709
It's me.

740
00:50:44,792 --> 00:50:46,711
Are you there?

741
00:50:50,673 --> 00:50:51,924
Oh, God.

742
00:50:52,008 --> 00:50:54,635
Well, you, uh...

743
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:57,263
you look like shit.

744
00:50:57,346 --> 00:50:58,973
Fuck off, Smurfette.

745
00:51:01,184 --> 00:51:03,519
You gonna be okay?

746
00:51:03,603 --> 00:51:06,230
Yeah, slowly, painfully,

747
00:51:06,314 --> 00:51:09,609
like every other powerless
schmuck in America,

748
00:51:09,692 --> 00:51:11,986
thanks to Soldier Boy.

749
00:51:14,155 --> 00:51:17,575
Question: should I get
a pirate patch

750
00:51:17,658 --> 00:51:20,119
or the Sammy Davis glass eye?

751
00:51:20,203 --> 00:51:21,523
Oh, the pirate patch,
no question.

752
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:23,206
You ready?

753
00:51:23,289 --> 00:51:25,291
- Hey.
- Hey, Elena.

754
00:51:26,876 --> 00:51:28,836
Where will you guys go?

755
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:31,964
I don't know, somewhere
Homelander won't find me.

756
00:51:32,048 --> 00:51:33,800
A farm, ideally.

757
00:51:33,883 --> 00:51:35,134
She's from Modesto.

758
00:51:35,218 --> 00:51:37,804
She was a Future Farmer
of America.

759
00:51:37,887 --> 00:51:40,014
- Great.
- Mm-hmm.

760
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:45,353
Thank you.

761
00:51:45,436 --> 00:51:47,480
For everything.

762
00:51:47,563 --> 00:51:50,775
First time your prissy ass

763
00:51:50,858 --> 00:51:53,486
showed up at the Tower,

764
00:51:53,569 --> 00:51:56,864
crying in that bathroom...

765
00:51:56,948 --> 00:51:58,491
You saved me.

766
00:51:58,574 --> 00:52:01,369
Truth is, you...
you don't need me anymore.

767
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:03,955
I could jump.

768
00:52:05,206 --> 00:52:07,250
But you can fucking fly.

769
00:52:10,336 --> 00:52:11,921
Oh.

770
00:52:16,968 --> 00:52:20,638
You're like a walking
Hallmark card. Enough.

771
00:52:23,516 --> 00:52:25,393
Bye.

772
00:53:44,597 --> 00:53:46,933
{\an8}<i>You don't know the real Kevin.</i>

773

{\an8}<i>Mm.</i>

774
00:53:48,267 --> 00:53:50,311
{\an8}<i>And you wouldn't like him
if you did.</i>

775
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:08,412
You sure you want to do this?

776
00:54:18,047 --> 00:54:19,966
I don't need it.

777
00:54:20,049 --> 00:54:22,551
I don't. The suit
never gave me any power.

778
00:54:22,635 --> 00:54:24,512
And Vought sure as shit didn't.

779
00:54:30,935 --> 00:54:34,397
It's always just been me.

780
00:54:40,027 --> 00:54:41,612
- Uh, Annie?
- Mm-hmm?

781
00:54:41,696 --> 00:54:44,407
You know, we're in
a historic building.

782
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:45,842
- You need to double-knot...
- Okay.

783
00:54:45,866 --> 00:54:47,618
And bag your trash,

784
00:54:47,702 --> 00:54:50,204
if you're gonna be working here.

785
00:54:51,747 --> 00:54:53,165
Butcher isn't gonna like it.

786
00:54:53,249 --> 00:54:55,918
Butcher can suck my shit.

787
00:54:56,002 --> 00:54:59,005
Oh, from now on,
this is a democracy, huh?

788
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:02,049
I say you're one of The Boys.

789
00:55:03,551 --> 00:55:05,511

790
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:32,955
