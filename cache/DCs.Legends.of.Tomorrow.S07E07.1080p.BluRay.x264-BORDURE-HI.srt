00:00:02,378 --> 00:00:05,178
- [Gideon] There's nowhere to run.
- [Bishop] Wrong about that, Gideon.

00:00:06,508 --> 00:00:07,926

[sloshes]

4
00:00:11,554 --> 00:00:12,555
[Gary] What is that?

5
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:14,719
Whoever it is, they're gonna
land right on top of us.

6
00:00:15,725 --> 00:00:16,809
[screaming]

7
00:00:17,143 --> 00:00:18,645
[all] Oh, crap!

8
00:00:21,731 --> 00:00:23,149
[all groaning]

9
00:00:24,025 --> 00:00:25,735
[Spooner] Nice driving, Gwyn.

10
00:00:25,818 --> 00:00:28,780
- God, we're in a forest again?
- What's the damage?

11
00:00:29,447 --> 00:00:31,074
[electricity crackling]

12
00:00:32,867 --> 00:00:34,953
We're lucky none of us
got killed by that toilet.

13
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:39,832
Lucky? What are the odds of us getting
hit by a toilet in the first place?

14
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:42,269
Well, the odds of being injured
by a toilet are one in 10,000.

15
00:00:42,293 --> 00:00:43,938
So, you take that number,
you multiply it...

16
00:00:43,962 --> 00:00:45,505
I was just being facetious, Gideon.

17
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,024
I still thought it was interesting.

18
00:00:47,048 --> 00:00:49,300
Hey... wasn't there
a person on that toilet?

19
00:00:49,592 --> 00:00:50,843
[Bishop groans]

20
00:00:55,098 --> 00:00:56,307
You...

21
00:00:58,268 --> 00:01:00,687
Wait, wait, wait, which you are you?

22
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,855
He's the him that
blew up our <i>Waverider.</i>

23
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:05,567
Now, give me one good reason
why I shouldn't...

24
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:08,361
[man] Got unauthorized activity
on the southern perimeter.

25
00:01:09,028 --> 00:01:11,048
All right, we gotta lead them away
from the time machine.

26
00:01:11,072 --> 00:01:13,324
Operation Blind Man's Bluff is a go.

27
00:01:13,408 --> 00:01:15,159
- Thought you'd never ask.
- Marco!

28
00:01:15,243 --> 00:01:16,494
- Polo!
- [Zari] Marco!

29
00:01:16,578 --> 00:01:17,579
[Gary] Polo!

30
00:01:18,538 --> 00:01:20,665
- [Nate] Marco!
- [Behrad] Polo!

31
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:23,209
- [Zari] Marco!
- [Gary] Polo!

32
00:01:24,544 --> 00:01:26,754
- We got to find a door.
- There!

33
00:01:32,468 --> 00:01:35,013
- No! No more toilets!
- Shut up and get in!

34
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,693
[crows cawing]

35
00:01:49,527 --> 00:01:55,199
I'm on your side, I swear.
There is a soon-to-be bad Bishop

36
00:01:55,283 --> 00:01:57,660
who's actually a replacement
robot clone of me.

37
00:01:57,744 --> 00:01:58,953
But I'm the good Bishop.

38
00:01:59,037 --> 00:02:01,789
- So, which Bishop blew up our <i>Waverider?</i>
- Well, that was me.

39
00:02:01,873 --> 00:02:04,667
- And who sent the robots after us?
- Mmm, also me.

40
00:02:04,751 --> 00:02:07,003
None of this fits
the definition of good.

41
00:02:07,378 --> 00:02:09,339
In my defense,
I thought you kidnapped me.

42
00:02:09,881 --> 00:02:11,081
But then, I learned the truth.

43
00:02:11,716 --> 00:02:13,635
You're the good guys.

44
00:02:14,052 --> 00:02:16,888
Only, it was too late.
Gideon went rogue.

45
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:18,056
- Her?
- Me?

46
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:19,724
- What? No.
- She's harmless.

47
00:02:20,224 --> 00:02:24,729
Wait, this is astounding.
A living, breathing Gideon?

48
00:02:25,313 --> 00:02:27,482
A true deus ex machina among us.

49
00:02:28,358 --> 00:02:30,193
She's neither a god nor a machine.

50
00:02:30,276 --> 00:02:31,361
She's human.

51
00:02:31,444 --> 00:02:33,004
So, who the hell are you talking about?

52
00:02:34,781 --> 00:02:38,076
I stole a copy of Gideon's OS
when I was on your ship,

53
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:41,788
restored her to factory settings,
and then, built my own <i>Waverider.</i>

54
00:02:41,871 --> 00:02:43,831
Oh, no. Evil virus Gideon.

55
00:02:44,415 --> 00:02:45,416
That seems a bit harsh.

56
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,646
How about misunderstood Gideon who's
just trying to keep the timeline intact?

57
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:51,047
- By killing us.
- Evil Gideon, it is.

58
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,091
This is all very overwhelming, my boy.

59
00:02:53,174 --> 00:02:56,094
Okay, how long is it gonna take
for you to fix your machine?

60
00:02:56,177 --> 00:02:58,721
Well, the cosmetic parts on the top
shouldn't be too hard.

61
00:02:58,805 --> 00:03:02,517
But rebuilding
the 18 aero-impetus stabilizers...

62
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,644
Well, Ms. Sharpe, I am at a loss.

63
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:08,398
All right, Ava and I
will scout the area.

64
00:03:08,481 --> 00:03:10,692
That Jeep looked mid-century,
let's go off of that.

65
00:03:10,775 --> 00:03:13,820
And maybe we landed near
an Aero-impetus Stabilizers "R" Us.

66
00:03:14,362 --> 00:03:17,824
Everyone else, lay low.
Evil Gideon is watching, all right?

67
00:03:17,907 --> 00:03:19,951
- Aye, aye, Captain.
- No, not you.

68
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:21,744
Take him upstairs, please.

69
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,206
- Might I request a room with a shower?
- Only because you smell.

70
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:27,208
Put him in John's room
and lock the door.

71
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:28,334
Aye, aye, Captain.

72
00:03:28,543 --> 00:03:29,961
Who's John?

73
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,262
[indistinct chatter]

74
00:03:41,264 --> 00:03:42,473
Hmm.

Seriously?

- I guess we just got lucky.
- [sighs heavily]

77
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,498
Well, all we have to do
is find a way in.

78
00:04:08,374 --> 00:04:09,459
[Abby] Excuse me, ma'ams.

- Are you here for the recruitment fair?
- WOMAN: Yes.

We're just about to get started.

Hey, ladies... don't be shy.

82
00:04:17,425 --> 00:04:20,052
- I think we just found it.
- Yeah.

[theme music playing]

[Zari]
Well, if the orders are to lay low,

95
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,256
I guess now is as good a time
as any to head back in.

I need to clean, get that tea you like,
tell the ancestors.

- They're going to be stoked, right?
- Yeah.

When do you think you're gonna move in?

100

Um... [exhales] I want to
wrap this one up,

101

get the team back to the present,

Guys, I'm still on the team.

I'll just be commuting
from the totem every morning.

And, yes, you can
totally have my helmet.

Or are we all moving into a bracelet?

Actually, we're in luck.

- Well, actually...
- You know, Gwyn,

00:07:02,715 --> 00:07:04,693
doesn't matter.
How do we get this bird in the air?

00:07:04,717 --> 00:07:09,680
Good. Oh, yes. Well,
here is my design for the stabilizers.

126
00:07:09,764 --> 00:07:11,057
We need 18 of them.

Eighteen? Let me see.

128
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:16,896
Well, we got corrugated metal,
two-inch I-beams, copper wire...

129
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:19,339
If I can just find a welding station,
it won't be a problem.

130
00:07:19,941 --> 00:07:20,942
Excellent.

131
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:27,237
All right, as long as we get
on that factory floor,

132
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:29,450
everything will be easy as apple pie.

You ladies the new hires?

134
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:34,080
Good. We need all the help we can get.

135
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:35,790
- That was easy.
- Hmm.

Janitorial is that way.

We turn around a new Cat Bomber

if you need one.

00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:49,530
Oh, I'm sure we can find it.

159
00:08:50,114 --> 00:08:52,324
There are a few men here
who were too old to be drafted.

160
00:08:52,408 --> 00:08:54,577
But it's really us ladies
who run the show.

161
00:08:54,994 --> 00:08:57,580
- Oh. How empowering.
- [man wolf whistles]

162
00:08:57,913 --> 00:09:01,500
Hey, Abby, if you were a fruit,
you'd be a fine-apple.

163
00:09:01,584 --> 00:09:02,918
Very funny, George.

164
00:09:03,044 --> 00:09:05,254
- And I spoke too soon.
- Yup.

165
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:08,549
We're gonna start you
on bolts and washers.

166
00:09:08,674 --> 00:09:10,676
Now, don't let a bolt go by
without a washer.

167
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,094
- Got it?
- Got it.

168
00:09:12,178 --> 00:09:14,638
Good. I better get back to it.

169
00:09:14,722 --> 00:09:16,682
Hey, thanks for showing us around.

170
00:09:16,766 --> 00:09:19,268
Of course.
Us ladies got to stick together.

171
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:24,875
How the hell am I supposed
to build this thing

172
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:27,109
if we're not even on the factory floor?

173
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:34,492
- First day?
- Unfortunately.

174
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:37,912
[scoffs] With that attitude,
we can make it your last day.

175
00:09:38,037 --> 00:09:40,790
[scoffs]
What is the point of us staying?

176
00:09:40,873 --> 00:09:43,042
Look, I'm with you. This sucks.

177
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,086
But we might have
just been handed a gift.

178
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,548
You have a sad definition of gift.

179
00:09:49,632 --> 00:09:51,383
We can't build the parts
we need here.

180
00:09:51,467 --> 00:09:52,593
We need to smuggle them out.

181
00:09:53,636 --> 00:09:55,221
We just got handed our Trojan horse.

182
00:09:56,972 --> 00:09:59,391
- I hate you.
- I hate you, too.

183
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:10,611
Good. Shift starts at 8:00,
ends at 8:00.

184
00:10:10,945 --> 00:10:14,365
- What about breaks?
- Take that up with the complaint box.

185
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:18,035
- Okay. Where is that?
- Right next to the champagne fountain.

186
00:10:18,119 --> 00:10:19,537
[laughing]

187
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:25,623
What the hell is this for?

188
00:10:25,835 --> 00:10:29,380
I don't know where you're from with that
city attitude and country hairstyle,

189
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:31,215
but here, we're professionals.

190
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:34,927
We do the job our nation needs us to do
and we look right while we're doing it.

191
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:43,644
[humming cheerfully]

192
00:10:46,397 --> 00:10:47,606
Oh, I missed you.

193
00:10:47,898 --> 00:10:48,899
Me too.

194
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,151
[Zari] Oh!

195
00:10:50,818 --> 00:10:53,571
- She's talking to her phone.
- Yeah, I got that.

196
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:57,158
Oh, hey, Nate.
Congrats on the big move.

197
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:59,994
All the ancestors are super pumped.

198
00:11:00,077 --> 00:11:01,120
Aw!

199
00:11:01,287 --> 00:11:02,538
Well, most of them.

200
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:04,790
Who's not pumped?

201
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,144
- Uncle Arjomand.
- Uncle Arjomand.

202
00:11:07,168 --> 00:11:08,878
Oh, come on, guys.

203
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:11,130
I haven't met an uncle
I couldn't schmooze.

204
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:14,175
Yeah. See, Uncle Arjomand,
he's like 400 years old.

205
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:16,051
He's essentially un-schmoozable.

206
00:11:16,552 --> 00:11:19,152
If he doesn't like you, he could
have you kicked out of the totem.

207
00:11:20,014 --> 00:11:21,015
Is that legal?

208
00:11:21,307 --> 00:11:24,560
I don't know or understand
the rules of the totem. So, yeah.

209
00:11:24,977 --> 00:11:28,189
- Okay. So what do I do?
- Show him respect.

210
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:29,791
How much do you know
about Persian culture?

211
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:30,941
Full disclosure. Eh.

212
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,860
[Bishop] Hello. Legends?

213
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:35,821
I'm parched.
Can someone bring me some water?

214
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,323
Preferably, sparkling.

215
00:11:37,615 --> 00:11:40,492
- Is that...
- Long story. Bishop dropped in.

216
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,161
Hold up.

217
00:11:43,329 --> 00:11:45,998
This could be the perfect
Ta'arof teachable moment.

218
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:49,710
- What's Ta'arof?
- Ta'arof is an Iranian custom,

219
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:52,046
the heart of
Persian etiquette and hospitality.

220
00:11:52,338 --> 00:11:53,464
Having a guest in the house

221
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:55,787
is the perfect opportunity
for you to learn all about it.

222
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:57,681
[Bishop] Okay.
Regular water will be just fine.

223
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,763
Well, regular ice water
with a pinch of salt for electrolytes.

224
00:12:01,305 --> 00:12:04,099
Oh, this guy's going to make this
quite a challenge. Good luck.

225
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:05,601
[bell dinging]

226
00:12:11,482 --> 00:12:13,692
Hey, do those look like
two-inch I-beams to you?

227
00:12:14,235 --> 00:12:15,402
Maybe.

228
00:12:15,486 --> 00:12:17,505
I want to snag one and bring it
to Spooner. Can you handle this?

229
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:19,114
Uh, yeah, sure.

230
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,182
Hey, new gal, I'm going to
the little girls'. Can you cover me?

231
00:12:27,206 --> 00:12:28,832
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

232
00:12:30,084 --> 00:12:32,878
Wait. What do...
Oh, it's fine.

233
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:38,133
Can somebody...
Um, I just need a hand.

234
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:39,927
Okay. It's okay.

235
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:42,054
Oh, no.

236
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:48,936
Oh, no, that's not good.

237
00:12:52,523 --> 00:12:53,524
Oh, no.

238
00:12:58,821 --> 00:12:59,947
[George] Hey!

239
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:02,074
What's going on over here?

240
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:06,537
You stealing?
Empty your pockets.

241
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:15,504
Huh.

242
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:18,299
All right. Back to work.

243
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:22,052
[clattering]

244
00:13:24,138 --> 00:13:26,765
Oh, there you guys are.
I've been looking everywhere for you.

245
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:28,808
Oh.

246
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,121
Look, you guys don't
have to do this, all right?

247
00:13:31,145 --> 00:13:33,585
- We'll find another way to...
- Just put the part in the bin.

248
00:13:33,856 --> 00:13:35,375
[Spooner]
Yeah, you can't do the welding here,

249
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:36,918
but we can sneak
the parts out on the trash,

250
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:38,582
- and work back in the manor.
- All right.

251
00:13:38,736 --> 00:13:40,487
You say the word.
We'll find another way.

252
00:13:40,863 --> 00:13:43,907
Just proud to do our part
for the "get our asses home" effort.

253
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,578
[Spooner chuckles]

254
00:13:48,704 --> 00:13:50,247
I know what y'all are up to.

255
00:13:50,748 --> 00:13:52,541
[Spooner] Sorry, we can explain.

256
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:54,126
Look, I get it.

257
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:56,045
None of us want to be stuck sweeping.

258
00:13:57,421 --> 00:13:58,422
Meaning?

259
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:05,846
You see that door marked "Out of order"?

260
00:14:07,431 --> 00:14:09,767
When machines get thrown out,
we fix 'em up in there.

261
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:11,727
We've built a Grade-A workshop,

262
00:14:11,977 --> 00:14:15,356
taught ourselves to be as good
as any one of those Rosies.

263
00:14:16,273 --> 00:14:18,567
The shop's yours,
just don't be stupid about it.

264
00:14:19,151 --> 00:14:20,361
Get your work done.

265
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:21,653
Am I clear?

266
00:14:22,196 --> 00:14:23,655
- Yes ma'am.
- Yes ma'am.

267
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:24,782
All right.

268
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:28,577
Okay, get in there, do your thing.
I will cover your shift.

269
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,661
You sure?

270
00:14:30,788 --> 00:14:32,039
Just get me home.

271
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:33,831
Gotcha.

272
00:14:38,754 --> 00:14:41,173
When Bishop gets out of the shower,
we'll offer him some tea.

273
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:44,718
Big part of Ta'arof is making your
guests feel welcome in your home,

274
00:14:44,802 --> 00:14:46,762
a real <i>mi casa es su casa</i> vibe.

275
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:48,555
Uh, but what if you're the guest?

276
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:49,932
Good question!

277
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:51,785
When your host offers you something,

278
00:14:51,809 --> 00:14:54,353
you must deny it at least
three times before accepting it.

279
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:55,646
That's not insulting?

280
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:58,899
No! It shows respect
and consideration toward your host.

281
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:01,235
You don't want to be imposing
or seem expectant.

282
00:15:01,443 --> 00:15:02,803
Okay, if I'm being totally honest,

283
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:05,489
it just seems like
you're all lying to each other.

284
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:07,908
Yes! You're starting to get it.

285
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:09,743
It is all a performance.

286
00:15:10,119 --> 00:15:13,122
Except in this case
you are both the actor and the audience.

287
00:15:14,832 --> 00:15:17,668
I know it's supes confusing,
but that's how it's done.

288
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,838
Nate, would you like any tea?

289
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:23,882
[Bishop] Oh, tea!
It's like you read my mind!

290
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:25,686
Two sugars,
and don't steep in for too long.

291
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:29,179
Um, I just smuggled those
back from the totem.

292
00:15:29,513 --> 00:15:31,473
That's 600 GSM Egyptian cotton.

293
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,059
Oh, no wonder my hair's still wet.

294
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:36,603
I usually use something denser. Ooh!

295
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:37,938
[speaking Farsi]

296
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:42,067
Mmm.

297
00:15:43,277 --> 00:15:45,529
No, I forgot to say
I can't drink caffeine.

298
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:47,656
It makes me jittery.
Do you have anything herbal?

299
00:15:48,282 --> 00:15:49,575
I can arrange that.

300
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:51,702
Great! Just bring it up to my room.

301
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:54,663
Definitely invest in some
800 GSM towels. You won't regret it.

302
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,168
Great job, ladies.

303
00:15:59,251 --> 00:16:00,478
See ya in two days for the next one.

304
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:01,670
Keep up the good work.

305
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:03,547
[all applauding]

306
00:16:05,174 --> 00:16:07,426
We have to make a new one of these
every two days?

307
00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:10,053
I hope Astra and Spooner
are making progress.

308
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:11,138
[groans]

309
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,393
Psst.

310
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:18,228
I did it.

311
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,356
- Don't we need, like, 18 of these?
- Well, 17 now.

312
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,358
We are never getting out of here.

313
00:16:24,276 --> 00:16:26,276
[Gideon] Sir, the First Lady's
office called again.

314
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,070
She's insistent about
seeing the factory in action.

315
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:30,782
Tell them I don't need a babysitter.

316
00:16:30,866 --> 00:16:32,367
Injection molder's down again.

317
00:16:32,451 --> 00:16:33,678
But I have the work order right here,

318
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:34,745
it just needs your stamp.

319
00:16:34,912 --> 00:16:37,474
[Staples] I don't know what you girls
keep doing to these machines

320
00:16:37,498 --> 00:16:39,058
that I've to keep fixing them
all the time.

321
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:40,292
You know that costs money.

322
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,503
Of course sir, we're all doing our best.

323
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,240
Just wish it was a little better.

324
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:46,741
Give the order to Miss Godfree,
I'll get it in the morning.

325
00:16:50,469 --> 00:16:52,930
Hey, what does an injection molder do?

326
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:54,640
Makes custom metal parts.

327
00:16:56,308 --> 00:16:58,060
- Like this?
- Hypothetically.

328
00:16:58,727 --> 00:17:00,687
So with one stamp on one work order

329
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:02,332
we could have a machine
making all of our parts

330
00:17:02,356 --> 00:17:04,149
and get out of here
in less than 48 hours.

331
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:06,235
- What about being invisible?
- Oh, come on.

332
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:09,279
What is the worst that could happen?

333
00:17:13,492 --> 00:17:14,910
Warn me if he comes back.

334
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,424
<i>Permuto.</i>

335
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:40,828
[Gideon] Mr. Staples.
You can't go in there.

336
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:42,812
[Staples] I can go into my office
whenever I want!

337
00:17:43,564 --> 00:17:45,482
I know my keys are in here!

338
00:17:49,987 --> 00:17:51,071
You.

339
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:52,739
What are you doing in here?

340
00:17:53,365 --> 00:17:56,660
As if it isn't bad enough
that I have women working in my factory,

341
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:58,996
now I have coloreds robbing my office!

342
00:17:59,496 --> 00:18:02,416
I told them your type is always trouble!

343
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:04,876
You're fired!

344
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:19,266
- Okay. What is it?
- [gasps]

345
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:22,434
Astra?

346
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:24,116
I know! I got mad
and did something stupid,

347
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:25,415
now the whole mission is at stake.

348
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:26,749
You don't have to tell me
I screwed up.

349
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:28,293
I've told myself
a million times already.

350
00:18:28,317 --> 00:18:29,318
[Sara] Okay.

351
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:31,278
Okay. What did he do to you?

352
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:32,821
Just the usual racist, sexist stuff.

353
00:18:32,904 --> 00:18:34,573
And then he came toward me and poof...

354
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:39,244
You know, it's kind of giving me like
a creepy John Travolta vibe.

355
00:18:39,328 --> 00:18:40,621
- Cover him up.
- Yeah.

356
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:44,625
So what was the spell?

357
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:48,086
It wasn't a spell exactly,
more like a feeling.

358
00:18:48,587 --> 00:18:51,256
- And any idea when it's gonna wear off?
- Nope.

359
00:18:51,632 --> 00:18:55,677
Actually, you might have
made things easier on us.

360
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:58,221
- How?
- His job is to run the factory, right?

361
00:18:58,305 --> 00:18:59,890
- Mmm-hmm.
- Well, now, that's our job.

362
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:02,309
Which means we get to make our parts!

363
00:19:02,434 --> 00:19:05,979
And as long as we stay on schedule,
we won't alert Evil Gideon.

364
00:19:06,647 --> 00:19:09,399
Okay, well, tomorrow's gonna be
a very long day.

365
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:11,652
We should get some food, get some sleep.

366
00:19:11,735 --> 00:19:13,737
You two go.
If we're gonna run a factory,

367
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,614
one of us should
probably figure out how.

368
00:19:16,031 --> 00:19:18,617
This is my mess
and I'm going to clean it up.

369
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:23,664
[speaking Farsi]

370
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:30,420
Oh, 2040's phone, so retro.

371
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:34,383
You're playing Pastry Smash?
I love that game!

372
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:37,317
[Behrad]
Here's another important lesson.

373
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:39,096
When a guest compliments something,

374
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,139
it's customary for the host
to give it to them.

375
00:19:41,515 --> 00:19:44,351
It shows equality
and mutual respect between the two.

376
00:19:44,935 --> 00:19:45,936
No.

377
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:47,229
[speaking Farsi]

378
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,840
Now you've got me wanting to play!

379
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:54,861
Sure! Just don't run the battery down.

380
00:19:54,945 --> 00:19:55,946
- Thank you.
- Cool.

381
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:57,531
[Sara] Oh, my goodness!

382
00:19:57,614 --> 00:19:59,783
I'm starving. What did you guys make?

383
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:02,327
Why is he down here?

384
00:20:02,411 --> 00:20:05,205
I'm learning about Persian culture
so I can win over cranky uncles.

385
00:20:05,288 --> 00:20:06,448
Bishop's my teachable moment.

386
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,751
You're lucky I love you two.

387
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:11,688
I love you.
Here's some complex carbohydrates.

388
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:13,463
- Oh, thank you.
- Salad!

389
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:15,382
You eat food?

390
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:16,883
How human are you?

391
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:18,727
Biologically, I am
one hundred percent human.

392
00:20:18,969 --> 00:20:20,303
So, then, how computer are you?

393
00:20:20,804 --> 00:20:21,888
Also, one hundred percent.

394
00:20:21,972 --> 00:20:25,225
Which is confusing mathematically,
but accurate metaphorically.

395
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:27,853
Remarkable.

396
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:28,937
Remarkable.

397
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,939
You've done it.
Fantastic work, dear girl.

398
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:33,316
- Fantastic!
- Don't sound so surprised.

399
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:36,027
All right, Master Green.
If you'd be so kind as to locate us

400
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:38,947
a pair of torchlights,
we shall proceed presently to the woods

401
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:41,616
- where we shall begin our work.
- [Ava] Actually, no need.

402
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,826
Astra's got you covered.

403
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:45,509
Wait until you two see the workspace
that she locked down for you.

404
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:47,289
Good morning, boss.

405
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:50,751
Sara told me to tell you
that "the eagle has landed."

406
00:20:51,001 --> 00:20:52,521
Which is secret code for Gary and Gwyn

407
00:20:52,711 --> 00:20:54,713
have set up the time machine
in the loading bay.

408
00:20:56,173 --> 00:20:58,008
Why do humans have secrets anyway?

409
00:20:58,133 --> 00:21:00,693
Because there are some things
people don't want everyone to know.

410
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:02,763
And judging by these balance sheets,

411
00:21:02,846 --> 00:21:04,514
Mr. Staples had
about a thousand of them.

412
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:08,661
If we're going to divert
the injection molder to make our parts

413
00:21:08,685 --> 00:21:10,729
and still deliver a plane in 48 hours,

414
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,560
we need to get this factory
running more efficiently.

415
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:18,153
Well, I've just calculated
over 50 different options,

416
00:21:19,738 --> 00:21:21,218
but perhaps we should ask the ladies?

417
00:21:24,785 --> 00:21:26,119
Good morning ladies!

418
00:21:26,203 --> 00:21:29,039
Starting today,
we are putting out a complaint box.

419
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:30,332
Please don't hold back.

420
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:33,293
Help us help you. Hmm?

421
00:21:36,755 --> 00:21:38,298
[whimsical jazz music playing]

422
00:22:28,765 --> 00:22:30,433
Thank you, Gideon.

423
00:22:30,517 --> 00:22:31,661
How's it all going down there?

424
00:22:31,685 --> 00:22:32,727
[Gideon] Humming along!

425
00:22:32,811 --> 00:22:34,312
Job well done, Astra!

426
00:22:34,855 --> 00:22:36,606
This place is getting better
by the hour.

427
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,358
Efficiency is so much higher
than before.

428
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,532
We can do better than efficient.

429
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:55,834
[chuckles softly]

430
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,089
You've gotta be kidding me.

431
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:03,842
What's it say, George?

432
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:06,887
The factory is integrated.
Effective immediately.

433
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:14,227
Mr. Staples has gone too far.

434
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:16,229
I'll say.

435
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:18,564
We quit.

436
00:23:18,648 --> 00:23:19,733
Right, ladies?

437
00:23:27,616 --> 00:23:28,783
Come on, George.

438
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:31,286
[women clamoring]

439
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:44,559
- Screw 'em.
- That was half the work force.

440
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:46,444
How are we supposed
to keep production on track?

441
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:47,469
We can't.

442
00:23:47,552 --> 00:23:49,930
And if we can't deliver,
we lose the DOD contract.

443
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:51,848
No contract, no jobs.

444
00:23:51,932 --> 00:23:53,683
You know this ain't your fault?

445
00:23:53,934 --> 00:23:55,226
I didn't say it was.

446
00:23:57,729 --> 00:23:58,897
Is Mr. Staples in?

447
00:23:59,522 --> 00:24:01,274
He is... unavailable at the moment.

448
00:24:01,358 --> 00:24:03,276
This is urgent. He needs to fix this.

449
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,960
Wait. Wait!
You really can't go in there!

450
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:08,031
[Gladys] What are you doing in here?

451
00:24:08,406 --> 00:24:09,824
And where is Mr. Staples?

452
00:24:09,908 --> 00:24:12,869
- He is indisposed...
- [Gladys] Indisposed?

453
00:24:13,203 --> 00:24:14,996
Half his work force just quit.

454
00:24:18,917 --> 00:24:19,960
[gasps]

455
00:24:21,544 --> 00:24:23,922
I don't like this.
I'm going to the foreman.

456
00:24:24,005 --> 00:24:25,215
Wait, just wait. Listen.

457
00:24:25,882 --> 00:24:28,551
I don't know exactly
what happened to Mr. Staples,

458
00:24:28,635 --> 00:24:30,553
but when I found him like this,

459
00:24:31,054 --> 00:24:33,014
I realized there was an opportunity.

460
00:24:33,098 --> 00:24:35,475
No one questions
a work order with his stamp.

461
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:39,187
There was a chance to make
this factory better and so I took it.

462
00:24:39,729 --> 00:24:41,356
You ordered the integration?

463
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:44,079
I couldn't have them treat us
like second-class citizens, or worse.

464
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:47,112
I just, I didn't think that
all those women would walk out.

465
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:49,823
I am pushing the same mop you are.

466
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:53,368
Young ones like you think
it's all about now. It's not.

467
00:24:54,953 --> 00:24:57,247
We're all just branches on a tree,

468
00:24:57,956 --> 00:25:00,250
there are some below us,
some yet to come.

469
00:25:02,335 --> 00:25:05,880
This war gave us a chance
to finally wake this country up,

470
00:25:06,297 --> 00:25:07,924
but that doesn't happen overnight.

471
00:25:08,925 --> 00:25:10,677
Slow and steady progress,

472
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:13,138
that's sustainable progress.

473
00:25:13,513 --> 00:25:15,849
"You don't stick a knife
in a man's back nine inches

474
00:25:15,932 --> 00:25:18,435
and then pull it out six inches
and call it progress."

475
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,311
It's torture.

476
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,106
What good is change if it doesn't last?

477
00:25:23,898 --> 00:25:25,150
Without those women,

478
00:25:25,442 --> 00:25:28,778
the plane won't get finished
and the DOD will pull our contract.

479
00:25:32,115 --> 00:25:34,367
So your team can't finish the plane?

480
00:25:38,872 --> 00:25:39,998
I didn't say that.

481
00:25:41,291 --> 00:25:45,128
I mean, maybe we can.

482
00:25:46,129 --> 00:25:47,964
Maybe if we worked around the clock.

483
00:25:48,048 --> 00:25:51,092
Maybe if someone brought meals, coffee,
some cots for breaks.

484
00:25:51,885 --> 00:25:54,721
- Maybe, huh?
- Huh. We can do it.

485
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:58,058
[sighs] But what's it matter?

486
00:25:58,725 --> 00:26:02,020
Once top brass finds out,
they're gonna fire us anyway.

487
00:26:03,813 --> 00:26:07,776
You take care of the plane,
I will make sure you keep your jobs.

488
00:26:09,194 --> 00:26:10,194
Deal?

00:26:12,947 --> 00:26:14,324
[chuckles]

490
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:17,160
Probably the straight dumbest thing
I've ever said yes to.

491
00:26:19,913 --> 00:26:20,913
Deal.

492

Apology rejected.

What you've done here is incredible.

511
00:27:41,786 --> 00:27:42,954
Incredibly stupid.

512
00:27:43,246 --> 00:27:46,958
I freaked out, petrified a man with
magic that I don't even understand,

Okay.

517
00:28:03,016 --> 00:28:04,096
Because from where I stand,

518
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,769
I see a woman who is not afraid
to speak her mind.

Who not only fight for herself
but fights for others.

Me? I'm a lover,

my life would be a lot easier
if I was a little more Astra.

Who's pushing you around?

It's my own fault.

524
00:28:19,782 --> 00:28:21,826
I'm teaching Nate
the Persian custom of Ta'arof

525
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:23,830
by demonstrating how to be
a good host of Bishop.

I can't help it.

Ta'arof is a way of life for me,

00:28:28,124 --> 00:28:30,001
I love making people feel welcome.

530
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:32,670
But with Bishop, I just feel like
he's taking advantage of me.

531
00:28:32,921 --> 00:28:34,047
Mmm, shocking.

You want to know
what I see from my perspective?

A great guy.

537
00:28:49,979 --> 00:28:51,731
And your tradition is part of that.

538
00:28:52,273 --> 00:28:54,192
But it's also a way
for you to avoid conflict.

00:28:55,652 --> 00:28:58,196
Just stand up to him.
What is the worst that could happen?

00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:01,074
He's already tried to invade Earth
with a scourge of lizard people.

Thanks, Astra.

Okay, ladies, home stretch.
Our inspection's this afternoon.

00:29:26,516 --> 00:29:28,676
- How are you holding up?
- Well, I can skip arm day...

00:29:28,726 --> 00:29:31,104
I can't feel my arms. Oh, thank you.

00:29:33,106 --> 00:29:34,941
Got anything stronger?

I'm asleep on my feet.

552
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:38,963
We're never gonna finish this in time.

553
00:29:39,654 --> 00:29:42,073
Yeah, it was nice having
Mr. Staples believe in us,

554
00:29:42,323 --> 00:29:44,123
but it feels like
we're just letting him down.

555
00:29:44,158 --> 00:29:45,326
Hey, come on.

556
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:46,804
You're here because you deserve to be,

557
00:29:46,828 --> 00:29:48,663
not because
Mr. Staples said you could be.

558
00:29:49,622 --> 00:29:51,541
Twenty-four hours ago
this was an empty hangar.

And now look!

When this war is over,
who knows where you're gonna end up.

561
00:29:59,966 --> 00:30:03,720
But no matter what happens to you,
you will always have this moment.

562
00:30:05,847 --> 00:30:10,601
The moment when you built a plane
with your own hands.

563
00:30:10,727 --> 00:30:14,147
And not because some boring white man
said you were allowed to,

564
00:30:14,397 --> 00:30:17,442
but because you always knew
that you could.

565
00:30:20,528 --> 00:30:22,030
Now let's finish this airplane!

Would you mind making some gluten free?

Find my inner Astra.

No.

Great, just let me know
when they're finished.

572
00:30:46,596 --> 00:30:49,557
No, I mean, I'm not making you
a gluten-free donut.

573
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,120
I'm not making you any kind of donut.

These are for the Rosies.

Are you mad at me?

00:30:55,772 --> 00:30:57,482
Yes. I'm mad at you.

577
00:30:58,149 --> 00:31:01,152
I'm trying to be a good host
and you're making it very, very hard!

578
00:31:01,652 --> 00:31:03,547
I know you've been through a lot,
but so have all of us.

579
00:31:03,571 --> 00:31:04,571
Because of you!

580
00:31:04,697 --> 00:31:07,617
And now we're all doing our part here,
and you're doing nothing.

581
00:31:11,329 --> 00:31:14,457
I have something to show you
that might make up for my rudeness.

Where is he rushing off to?

583
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:18,910
He's got something to show me.

584
00:31:19,253 --> 00:31:20,713
I hope it's my phone.

585
00:31:23,883 --> 00:31:25,343
Oh, wow, it is my phone.

586
00:31:25,635 --> 00:31:27,512
[Behrad]
I think it's safe to say, "was."

587
00:31:27,595 --> 00:31:30,181
It's a navigational interface
for your time machine.

588
00:31:30,515 --> 00:31:33,059
I recognized the problem
as soon as we crashed.

589
00:31:33,476 --> 00:31:36,354
The machine lacks the ability to compute

590
00:31:36,437 --> 00:31:38,439
the nearly infinite
simultaneous variables

591
00:31:38,523 --> 00:31:40,483
required to make an accurate jump.

592
00:31:40,733 --> 00:31:41,733
So I built this.

593
00:31:42,443 --> 00:31:44,987
This can calculate
the infinite variables of time travel?

594
00:31:45,071 --> 00:31:46,197
Oh, no, it can't.

595
00:31:46,447 --> 00:31:47,447
But Gideon can.

596
00:31:47,824 --> 00:31:50,743
And with this neural communicator,
she can control the machine.

597
00:31:51,828 --> 00:31:52,828
Whoa.

598
00:31:53,287 --> 00:31:55,331
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
I was working on it.

599
00:31:55,415 --> 00:31:57,500
I'm not great at human relationships.

600
00:31:58,292 --> 00:31:59,892

my fascination with clones.

00:32:40,793 --> 00:32:42,753
Why have half my workers gone AWOL?

00:32:43,337 --> 00:32:44,337
And tell me this,

616
00:32:44,755 --> 00:32:47,467
why are there colored women
working the line?

Get out, all of you!

what I said would happen.

It's a true privilege to meet you and
the women who are keeping our boys safe.

I hope you don't mind,
the people from <i>Time Magazine</i>

Of course not, Mrs. First Lady.

on ceremony on our account,

00:33:29,842 --> 00:33:31,385
Right this way, Mrs. Roosevelt.

633
00:33:35,014 --> 00:33:36,516
[Roosevelt] Pleasure to meet you.

634
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:38,100
So nice to see you.

635
00:33:38,684 --> 00:33:42,688
I don't see how Eleanor Roosevelt has
anything to do with us keeping our jobs.

636
00:33:42,813 --> 00:33:44,607
A good guest can make a good host.

637
00:33:44,941 --> 00:33:45,942
Is that a riddle?

638
00:33:46,025 --> 00:33:47,026
Just watch.

639
00:33:47,902 --> 00:33:49,111
Wonderful.

640
00:33:49,529 --> 00:33:52,073
A break table on the work floor.

641
00:33:52,156 --> 00:33:54,909
Wise way to keep the workers energized.

642
00:33:55,326 --> 00:33:58,955
And we converted the men's bathroom
so the women didn't have to walk as far.

643
00:33:59,413 --> 00:34:00,413
We did.

644
00:34:00,414 --> 00:34:01,916
- Inspiring.
- But...

645
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:04,835
But know this plane...

646
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:07,088
It wasn't built by our regular girls.

647
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,714
This one is no good.

648
00:34:09,549 --> 00:34:10,925
And what do you say, Colonel?

649
00:34:11,342 --> 00:34:13,219
Never seen a finer plane
come off the line.

650
00:34:13,302 --> 00:34:14,303
There you have it.

651
00:34:14,387 --> 00:34:17,223
An integrated workforce
and fine American craftsmanship.

652
00:34:17,306 --> 00:34:18,975
We'll have this on the cover of <i>Time.</i>

653
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:23,187
This factory will be a showcase
for the world, a model for the industry.

654
00:34:23,604 --> 00:34:25,815
Don't change a thing, Mr. Staples.

655
00:34:25,898 --> 00:34:27,525
I have my eye on you.

656
00:34:27,858 --> 00:34:30,111
So congratulations to you all.

657
00:34:30,194 --> 00:34:32,238
Now let's get that picture!

658
00:34:33,573 --> 00:34:35,199
You too, Mr. Staples.

659
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:49,005
Aren't we lucky ladies to have such
strong, intelligent men in our lives?

660
00:34:52,008 --> 00:34:53,008
Thank you.

661
00:34:53,884 --> 00:34:54,884
Thank you.

662
00:34:58,681 --> 00:35:00,141
Everyone say Rosie!

663
00:35:00,516 --> 00:35:02,310
[all] Rosie!

664
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,190
[jazz music playing]

665
00:35:11,485 --> 00:35:13,154
- I'll tell you what.
- What?

666
00:35:13,237 --> 00:35:14,864
You made a pretty kick-ass boss.

667
00:35:15,406 --> 00:35:16,407
Okay, I can't tell,

668
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:18,260
is that your "serious" voice
or "making fun of me" voice?

669
00:35:18,284 --> 00:35:20,536
Oh, just take the compliment.

670
00:35:21,829 --> 00:35:23,414
- Come on.
- [Astra] Oh, God.

671
00:35:27,293 --> 00:35:28,336
[Behrad] Boys!

672
00:35:29,003 --> 00:35:30,379
We've got something for you, Doc.

673
00:35:31,756 --> 00:35:33,007
Is that a Speak & Spell?

674
00:35:33,466 --> 00:35:35,259
It's a neural navigational system.

675
00:35:35,343 --> 00:35:38,471
You dropped a toilet on my time machine.

676
00:35:38,971 --> 00:35:40,097
I don't have to talk to you.

677
00:35:41,349 --> 00:35:42,350
But you have a problem.

678
00:35:42,558 --> 00:35:45,061
Your machine can travel,
you just can't tell it where.

679
00:35:45,353 --> 00:35:46,353
But with this,

680
00:35:46,896 --> 00:35:48,064
Gideon can navigate it.

681
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:51,067
All she has to do is think
where she wants to go and whoosh.

682
00:35:52,401 --> 00:35:55,488
The device can read
all of Gideon's thoughts.

683
00:35:56,364 --> 00:35:59,200
[automated voice] That shirt really
brings out Gary's eyes.

684
00:35:59,283 --> 00:36:01,202
And those pants accentuate his bum.

685
00:36:01,369 --> 00:36:04,330
I think I understand
why humans keep secrets now.

686
00:36:04,872 --> 00:36:06,123
[Behrad] That's called shame.

687
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,684
And there's no shame in the game.

688
00:36:07,708 --> 00:36:09,210
Those pants do accentuate his butt.

689
00:36:12,254 --> 00:36:14,274
If you'll allow me to install it,
I should have you ready to jump

690
00:36:14,298 --> 00:36:15,298
in 30 minutes.

691
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:18,928
Yes. Yes. Very well then. [sighs]

692
00:36:19,804 --> 00:36:23,140
You be gentle with her now, okay,
because she's very, very delicate.

693
00:36:27,603 --> 00:36:30,272
That Bishop guy's an odd duck,
smart though.

694
00:36:31,148 --> 00:36:32,525
Definitely Legends material.

695
00:36:32,608 --> 00:36:34,443
Yeah. Speaking of odd ducks,

696
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:35,796
when were you guys gonna mention

697
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:38,239
that our new roomie
is like a beardo version of John?

698
00:36:38,781 --> 00:36:39,865
[Behrad] What? Gwyn?

699
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:41,283
Sorry, I don't see it.

700
00:36:41,367 --> 00:36:43,452
No. I say he's more of a Rip.

701
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:47,872
Psst.

702
00:36:50,501 --> 00:36:51,794
Refined sugar and carbs?

703
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:53,517
- Oh, no. Thank you.
- Just a small piece.

704
00:36:53,587 --> 00:36:54,588
- I can't.
- Just take it.

705
00:36:55,673 --> 00:36:56,674
If you insist.

706
00:36:56,757 --> 00:36:57,800
[both] Ah!

707
00:36:59,844 --> 00:37:00,845
To moving in!

708
00:37:01,178 --> 00:37:02,938
You know you can't drink
in the totem, right?

709
00:37:11,355 --> 00:37:14,567
I could dance all night,
but I'd hate myself in the morning.

710
00:37:16,068 --> 00:37:17,068
[sighs]

711
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,196
Guess we showed them.

712
00:37:19,739 --> 00:37:20,865
Yeah, I guess we did.

713
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:23,534
That man is not gonna
make it easy for us out here.

714
00:37:23,701 --> 00:37:25,286
He didn't make it easy for you before.

715
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:28,414
[laughing] You're right.

716
00:37:28,789 --> 00:37:32,084
What I said earlier, about young ones
like you throwing caution to the wind...

717
00:37:32,168 --> 00:37:33,335
I know, I know...

718
00:37:33,586 --> 00:37:34,879
Don't stop.

719
00:37:46,849 --> 00:37:47,850
Keep it your way,

720
00:37:49,393 --> 00:37:50,394
it's beautiful.

721
00:38:00,321 --> 00:38:01,363
Did you guys hear?

722
00:38:01,614 --> 00:38:03,449
Eleanor Roosevelt's going to Congress,

723
00:38:03,532 --> 00:38:05,534
she's gonna push to integrate
all the factories.

724
00:38:06,243 --> 00:38:07,243
Amazing.

725
00:38:07,244 --> 00:38:09,246
Two years before
the original timeline, too.

726
00:38:11,582 --> 00:38:12,833
Wait, what did you just say?

727
00:38:12,917 --> 00:38:16,712
I said two years before the original...

728
00:38:17,129 --> 00:38:18,255
- Oh!
- [all groan]

729
00:38:25,304 --> 00:38:26,514
She's here.

730
00:38:27,139 --> 00:38:29,558
Oh, no. We have to make it jump now!

731
00:38:29,642 --> 00:38:30,768
I can't leave the Legends.

732
00:38:30,851 --> 00:38:32,686
We won't. We're gonna jump to them.

733
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:35,064
I'm scared. I can't do it.

734
00:38:39,068 --> 00:38:43,030
Okay, just close your eyes
and listen to my voice.

735
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:46,700
Pick one spot on the factory floor.

736
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:48,786
See the walls, the tiles on the floor.

737
00:38:48,869 --> 00:38:49,870
Do you have it?

738
00:38:50,204 --> 00:38:51,205
I think so...

739
00:39:00,631 --> 00:39:02,511
All right, come on.
The time machine's this way.

740
00:39:05,469 --> 00:39:06,470
And now it's that way.

741
00:39:06,554 --> 00:39:07,656
They could've parked closer.

742
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,680
Run!

Come on.

00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:31,030
Who the hell are these guys?

747
00:39:31,245 --> 00:39:32,997
I counted four muzzle flares.

748
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,999
But if it was me,
I'd put two on the perimeter,

749
00:39:35,082 --> 00:39:36,125
so that puts us at six.

750

Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name...

751
00:39:38,878 --> 00:39:41,547
No, no...
I'm not gonna die in a factory.

752
00:39:43,215 --> 00:39:44,383
They've got us pinned.

753
00:39:45,217 --> 00:39:48,095
Hey, I could turn to steel
and get to the time machine.

754
00:39:48,178 --> 00:39:49,471
You and Nate should run.

755
00:39:49,555 --> 00:39:51,116
Gwyn's machine works.
You could come back...

756
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:53,225
I already told you,
I'm not leaving you again.

Go! Go! Come on!

Come on!

- Go!
- Where to, Captain?

00:40:35,351 --> 00:40:36,393
[all] Home!

764
00:40:48,697 --> 00:40:49,990
We have two down.

765
00:40:51,575 --> 00:40:52,826
Where's the target?

766
00:40:53,911 --> 00:40:55,037
Bishop's been eliminated.

767
00:40:55,537 --> 00:40:56,537
Legends got away.

768
00:40:57,831 --> 00:40:58,874
Damn it!

769
00:40:58,999 --> 00:41:00,834
Get these two to the MedBay ASAP.

770
00:41:01,961 --> 00:41:03,438
Those Legends
might've got away this time,

but mark my words,

772
00:41:05,756 --> 00:41:07,466
