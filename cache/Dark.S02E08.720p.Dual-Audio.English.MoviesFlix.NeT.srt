1
00:01:52,088 --> 00:01:54,546
The beginning is the end.

2
00:01:56,046 --> 00:01:58,046
And the end is the beginning.

3
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,713
Everything is interconnected.

4
00:02:05,546 --> 00:02:06,880
Future,

5
00:02:07,505 --> 00:02:08,838
past

6
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:11,213
and present.

7
00:02:13,755 --> 00:02:16,338
I couldn't tell her who her mother is.

8
00:02:20,005 --> 00:02:22,880
Just as I can't tell you...

9
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,880
what your provision is.

10
00:02:28,546 --> 00:02:30,755
And what I have to do today.

11
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:35,380
I've reflected on this moment
for many years.

12
00:02:36,463 --> 00:02:38,671
My older me

13
00:02:38,755 --> 00:02:40,421
wanted to tell me something,

14
00:02:40,963 --> 00:02:42,546
but he couldn't.

15
00:02:49,463 --> 00:02:52,421
If you knew what I now know,

16
00:02:54,088 --> 00:02:58,421
then you would no longer do what you must
so I can get to this moment.

17
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:03,463
Me, as I stand here now, cannot exist

18
00:03:03,546 --> 00:03:06,171
if you don't take the same path as I did.

19
00:03:10,838 --> 00:03:12,421
We're not free

20
00:03:13,921 --> 00:03:15,546
in what we do,

21
00:03:17,005 --> 00:03:19,505
because we're not free in what we desire.

22
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,588
Everything is ready.

23
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:34,005
You must go now.

24
00:04:09,421 --> 00:04:12,005
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

25
00:05:33,713 --> 00:05:36,130
JUNE 27, 2020

26
00:05:36,213 --> 00:05:40,088
THE DAY OF THE APOCALYPSE

27
00:05:50,421 --> 00:05:52,463
FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY
PASSPORT

28
00:06:06,213 --> 00:06:08,421
My future me tried to shut the hole.

29
00:06:10,338 --> 00:06:11,921
To reverse it all.

30
00:06:14,713 --> 00:06:17,838
He shut the passage,
but hadn't broken the loop.

31
00:06:18,796 --> 00:06:22,713
But you said we can change
a small part of the equation, so he...

32
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,421
So I will be successful next time.

33
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,588
Then none of this sick shit
will ever happen.

34
00:06:33,213 --> 00:06:34,838
Mikkel won't disappear.

35
00:06:36,338 --> 00:06:37,880
Michael won't die.

36
00:06:41,921 --> 00:06:43,296
Your father won't die.

37
00:06:55,671 --> 00:06:58,338
Big and small things
don't abide by the same laws.

38
00:06:59,921 --> 00:07:02,005
Maybe nothing big can be altered...

39
00:07:08,088 --> 00:07:09,338
but small things can.

40
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,463
We're changing a grain of sand.

41
00:07:18,296 --> 00:07:20,338
And with it, the whole world.

42
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:30,296
What was Grandma like?

43
00:07:30,838 --> 00:07:32,505
I mean, as a mother.

44
00:07:33,338 --> 00:07:35,505
Why does it suddenly interest you?

45
00:07:39,338 --> 00:07:41,171
She isn't dead, you know?

46
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:43,796
What do you mean?

47
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:45,838
She was here.

48
00:07:46,588 --> 00:07:48,005
Last fall.

49
00:07:49,588 --> 00:07:51,505
After Mikkel disappeared.

50
00:07:53,963 --> 00:07:55,213
She...

51
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,880
She left something here.

52
00:08:01,588 --> 00:08:02,755
For you.

53
00:08:17,796 --> 00:08:20,046
She said she was sorry.

54
00:08:22,338 --> 00:08:24,921
And that if she could turn back time,

55
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:29,463
she'd do lots of things differently.

56
00:08:47,796 --> 00:08:49,213
I'll be back.

57
00:08:51,171 --> 00:08:52,505
I promise.

58
00:08:56,463 --> 00:08:58,130
Where are you going?

59
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,755
Do you know what this is?

60
00:09:27,005 --> 00:09:29,213
A search warrant for the power plant.

61
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,130
Special conditions apply to the plant.

62
00:09:33,213 --> 00:09:35,546
The judge issued the warrant immediately.

63
00:09:36,921 --> 00:09:38,171
I think,

64
00:09:38,838 --> 00:09:42,380
given the ongoing legal proceedings
against you,

65
00:09:43,713 --> 00:09:45,921
he may be interested in
what's to be found there.

66
00:09:51,005 --> 00:09:53,338
WARRANT

67
00:09:55,755 --> 00:09:58,630
Maybe I can't prove you killed my brother,

68
00:10:01,796 --> 00:10:03,963
but I'll get you for what's going on here.

69
00:10:12,421 --> 00:10:14,463
You have to let me out of here.

70
00:10:14,546 --> 00:10:15,838
That's impossible.

71
00:10:16,796 --> 00:10:18,213
I can't do that.

72
00:10:20,088 --> 00:10:22,130
You can't let him onto the site!

73
00:10:24,338 --> 00:10:25,796
Maybe this is better.

74
00:10:26,588 --> 00:10:28,921
Maybe it's good
it's all finally coming out.

75
00:10:49,963 --> 00:10:53,255
Martha,
I didn't want any of this, believe me.

76
00:10:53,963 --> 00:10:56,171
- Please listen...
- What are you doing here?

77
00:10:56,838 --> 00:10:58,046
Come on!

78
00:10:59,671 --> 00:11:01,921
Why are you here?

79
00:11:03,588 --> 00:11:04,796
What do you want?

80
00:11:06,088 --> 00:11:08,005
You have to come with me. Please.

81
00:11:09,921 --> 00:11:11,921
It's my fault everyone dies.

82
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,255
- What?
- It's all going to blow in a few hours.

83
00:11:15,546 --> 00:11:19,921
Everything starts all over again.
The future starts. A new cycle.

84
00:11:20,005 --> 00:11:21,380
What are you talking about?

85
00:11:23,796 --> 00:11:25,505
Please believe me, please.

86
00:11:30,963 --> 00:11:32,796
You have to trust me, please.

87
00:11:49,546 --> 00:11:50,921
This is wrong.

88
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:54,338
We're wrong.

89
00:11:57,463 --> 00:11:58,963
Please leave now.

90
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:03,255
No.

91
00:12:08,088 --> 00:12:09,088
I can't let you go.

92
00:12:09,171 --> 00:12:10,505
You're hurting me.

93
00:12:10,588 --> 00:12:13,546
I saw you die once.
I won't let it happen again.

94
00:12:14,755 --> 00:12:15,755
Let me go.

95
00:12:15,838 --> 00:12:16,838
I can't.

96
00:12:23,005 --> 00:12:24,838
I promised you I'd make it right.

97
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,380
I'm making it right.

98
00:12:32,671 --> 00:12:36,796
SIX HOURS TO THE APOCALYPSE

99
00:12:45,505 --> 00:12:46,755
Where's the device?

100
00:12:50,296 --> 00:12:51,963
Where's the fucking device?

101
00:12:53,171 --> 00:12:54,380
My mom has it.

102
00:12:57,505 --> 00:12:58,921
That's not right.

103
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,838
It shouldn't happen this way.

104
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,296
It's all my fault.

105
00:13:06,213 --> 00:13:08,296
Why didn't Noah tell me what to do?

106
00:13:09,213 --> 00:13:10,755
Why did he tell me it all?

107
00:13:11,963 --> 00:13:15,755
Explains the thing to me
and doesn't tell me what to do with it.

108
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:20,005
Maybe you did
exactly what you were supposed to do.

109
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,046
You showed us how it works.

110
00:13:23,421 --> 00:13:25,463
Maybe that was your sole task.

111
00:13:27,213 --> 00:13:28,296
Fuck!

112
00:13:30,213 --> 00:13:31,463
Fuck!

113
00:13:32,005 --> 00:13:33,296
Where are you going?

114
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,713
To find the fucking device!

115
00:13:43,921 --> 00:13:45,088
Hello?

116
00:13:52,546 --> 00:13:53,630
Jonas?

117
00:14:01,963 --> 00:14:03,255
Jonas?

118
00:15:03,755 --> 00:15:06,421
FOLLOW THE SIGNAL

119
00:15:14,755 --> 00:15:16,255
What's that?

120
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:17,880
The passage.

121
00:15:18,921 --> 00:15:20,588
We're opening it again.

122
00:15:20,671 --> 00:15:22,546
You said you wanted to shut it.

123
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,838
In the future.

124
00:15:24,921 --> 00:15:27,255
Or the past. Your future!

125
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:35,171
It took me ages to accept having to be
part of the disaster I wanted to prevent.

126
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,088
How do you know all this?

127
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:39,296
In the last 12 months.

128
00:15:40,255 --> 00:15:41,921
You taught me everything,

129
00:15:43,005 --> 00:15:44,671
about the future and past.

130
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,213
Everything that happened.

131
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,588
Everything that will happen.

132
00:15:51,338 --> 00:15:52,880
There are two sides out there.

133
00:15:53,546 --> 00:15:55,671
Adam and Sic Mundus
want to create a new world.

134
00:15:56,046 --> 00:15:58,005
You and I want to save this one.

135
00:15:59,963 --> 00:16:01,255
Who's Adam?

136
00:16:57,255 --> 00:16:58,546
What is this?

137
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:00,380
The only safe place.

138
00:17:03,213 --> 00:17:04,380
Please don't.

139
00:17:05,088 --> 00:17:06,338
Please.

140
00:17:07,213 --> 00:17:08,838
Why are you doing this?

141
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,338
Because I know what happens today.

142
00:17:16,463 --> 00:17:17,921
The Mikkel story...

143
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,546
is it true?

144
00:17:31,421 --> 00:17:32,671
Then I...

145
00:17:35,713 --> 00:17:37,505
I didn't want all this, Martha.

146
00:17:38,171 --> 00:17:39,880
You kept me alive.

147
00:17:40,546 --> 00:17:42,588
I'm still here because of you.

148
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:47,421
Jonas will come back.
It'll all happen as it always has.

149
00:17:48,088 --> 00:17:50,921
But I can't stop hoping
I can change something.

150
00:17:51,713 --> 00:17:52,880
I have to.

151
00:17:54,421 --> 00:17:56,130
Jonas will come back?

152
00:17:58,963 --> 00:18:01,255
Promise me you won't leave this bunker.

153
00:18:02,713 --> 00:18:04,130
No matter what happens.

154
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:10,380
I'm sorry.

155
00:18:46,463 --> 00:18:48,255
POLICE

156
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:56,130
MISSING

157
00:18:58,755 --> 00:18:59,755
Charlotte?

158
00:19:00,838 --> 00:19:03,796
- I thought you were still sick.
- Is Clausen here?

159
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,505
No. Clausen arrested Aleksander.

160
00:19:05,921 --> 00:19:08,171
He got a search warrant
for the power plant.

161
00:19:08,255 --> 00:19:09,713
He's headed there.

162
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,088
Charlotte!

163
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:18,505
I... I have to tell you something.

164
00:19:33,671 --> 00:19:35,838
On the nuclear power plant grounds,

165
00:19:37,421 --> 00:19:39,838
Aleksander buried something
in concrete there.

166
00:19:42,171 --> 00:19:43,171
Radioactive waste.

167
00:19:45,338 --> 00:19:46,921
I helped him do it.

168
00:19:49,046 --> 00:19:50,380
I'm sorry.

169
00:19:51,671 --> 00:19:52,921
That triggers it.

170
00:19:53,546 --> 00:19:55,255
- What?
- It's all connected.

171
00:19:55,338 --> 00:19:58,338
He said it all has to do
with the power plant.

172
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:01,505
- Jonas knew it.
- You found Jonas?

173
00:20:01,588 --> 00:20:03,588
No, he traveled back from the future.

174
00:20:05,005 --> 00:20:06,421
We have to go.

175
00:20:09,088 --> 00:20:10,130
Wöller!

176
00:20:11,088 --> 00:20:12,338
Come on.

177
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:16,255
FOR CHARLOTTE

178
00:20:16,338 --> 00:20:19,213
Charlotte, where are you?
Is Franziska with you?

179
00:20:20,255 --> 00:20:22,255
Call me once you get this.

180
00:20:43,046 --> 00:20:44,338
We're going now.

181
00:20:45,005 --> 00:20:46,255
Where?

182
00:20:46,755 --> 00:20:48,505
I no longer know

183
00:20:49,046 --> 00:20:50,713
what I should believe.

184
00:20:51,005 --> 00:20:52,838
But Noah said

185
00:20:52,921 --> 00:20:56,296
only the people in the bunker

186
00:20:58,338 --> 00:20:59,630
survive.

187
00:21:04,088 --> 00:21:06,171
What about Mom and Franziska?

188
00:21:09,671 --> 00:21:12,838
It'll all be okay.

189
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,671
FOUR HOURS UNTIL THE APOCALYPSE

190
00:21:24,755 --> 00:21:28,005
I don't quite get
what you hope to achieve here.

191
00:21:28,838 --> 00:21:32,588
The site is huge.
Controlled shutdown takes place tomorrow.

192
00:21:32,671 --> 00:21:36,171
My mother always said,
"Just because a task seems too big

193
00:21:36,255 --> 00:21:38,046
doesn't mean it's unsolvable."

194
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:42,046
What's behind this door?

195
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:43,255
The...

196
00:21:43,338 --> 00:21:46,588
The spent fuel pool for the old reactor.

197
00:21:46,671 --> 00:21:48,921
It's been out of use since the 90s.

198
00:21:49,005 --> 00:21:50,671
I'd like to see it.

199
00:21:52,755 --> 00:21:56,171
You can't just go see it.
There's residual radiation.

200
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,838
Anyway,
I don't think you'll find anything there.

201
00:22:26,171 --> 00:22:28,796
PHOTO ALBUM
MICHAEL

202
00:23:11,213 --> 00:23:13,796
JUST AFTER HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION

203
00:23:17,505 --> 00:23:19,130
Katharina?

204
00:23:26,046 --> 00:23:27,546
How does this machine work?

205
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,421
Where did you get it?

206
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:40,755
How can I bring Mikkel back?

207
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:45,505
Even if I explain it to you,
it's impossible.

208
00:23:46,588 --> 00:23:48,588
You don't want him to return.

209
00:23:49,421 --> 00:23:53,088
- Because then you'd no longer exist.
- I wish it were so simple.

210
00:23:54,921 --> 00:23:57,296
Things in the past can't be changed.

211
00:23:57,963 --> 00:24:00,338
Mikkel can't return
because I already exist.

212
00:24:01,755 --> 00:24:04,088
Mikkel belongs here, and not you!

213
00:24:04,671 --> 00:24:06,421
You shouldn't exist at all.

214
00:24:07,963 --> 00:24:09,005
Yes.

215
00:24:11,546 --> 00:24:13,630
I'd trade my life for his anytime.

216
00:24:15,255 --> 00:24:18,255
But I can't die,
because my future already exists.

217
00:24:20,046 --> 00:24:22,880
You'd be just as incapable
of bringing Mikkel back.

218
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,796
Then why did you return?

219
00:24:28,046 --> 00:24:30,171
I tried to prevent the origin.

220
00:24:31,796 --> 00:24:33,588
But it's impossible. I can't.

221
00:24:34,296 --> 00:24:35,921
Adam is the endpoint.

222
00:24:36,546 --> 00:24:39,755
Maybe I can't prevent myself
from becoming what he is.

223
00:24:40,463 --> 00:24:42,588
But I can stop what has become of me.

224
00:25:05,588 --> 00:25:07,588
I know you lied to me.

225
00:25:11,088 --> 00:25:13,380
You never meant to save them.

226
00:25:14,005 --> 00:25:15,421
None of them.

227
00:25:20,421 --> 00:25:23,088
We can't escape our fate.

228
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,838
Neither you nor I.

229
00:25:31,421 --> 00:25:33,921
You're not waging war against God.

230
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:38,130
You're waging it against humanity.

231
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,546
Here are the last pages.

232
00:25:45,963 --> 00:25:47,463
You used me.

233
00:25:48,921 --> 00:25:50,838
You had me do all these things,

234
00:25:52,421 --> 00:25:54,213
but I know now what I must do.

235
00:25:57,463 --> 00:25:58,880
Claudia was right.

236
00:26:00,046 --> 00:26:02,713
You still don't understand
how this game is played.

237
00:26:06,255 --> 00:26:07,838
What are you waiting for?

238
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:16,921
Time plays its cruel game with us.

239
00:26:17,463 --> 00:26:20,046
You believe your destiny is to kill me.

240
00:26:20,838 --> 00:26:25,338
But that is as little your fate
as it is mine to die here and now.

241
00:26:31,838 --> 00:26:35,546
Only when we're free of all emotion
are we truly free.

242
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,671
Only when one is ready to sacrifice
what one holds dearest.

243
00:26:43,505 --> 00:26:45,255
Charlotte is your daughter.

244
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:48,088
She is Elisabeth's daughter.

245
00:26:48,505 --> 00:26:50,005
And her mother.

246
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:55,796
No human is without guilt.

247
00:26:57,505 --> 00:27:01,255
None of them have earned
a place in your paradise.

248
00:27:13,921 --> 00:27:15,255
Agnes?

249
00:27:18,713 --> 00:27:19,963
This knot

250
00:27:20,755 --> 00:27:23,046
can only be undone

251
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:26,255
by destroying it entirely.

252
00:27:29,713 --> 00:27:33,838
We cannot escape our destiny.

253
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,838
What is happening?

254
00:28:50,921 --> 00:28:52,588
This is time.

255
00:28:56,421 --> 00:28:59,088
We connect past and future.

256
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,213
What's that?

257
00:29:52,546 --> 00:29:55,588
It's Jonas. He opened the passage again.

258
00:29:56,338 --> 00:29:58,421
The thing Mikkel went through?

259
00:29:59,421 --> 00:30:00,796
Yes.

260
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,213
Martha.

261
00:30:21,838 --> 00:30:24,921
Is everything okay?
Who locked you in here?

262
00:30:25,921 --> 00:30:28,296
Hey, wait!
Martha, you can't go out there!

263
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:29,505
Martha!

264
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,630
- What was that?
- Fuck.

265
00:30:42,713 --> 00:30:45,380
It was the same noise
as the one from in the cave.

266
00:30:45,463 --> 00:30:47,380
- Fuck.
- You got it?

267
00:30:48,921 --> 00:30:50,880
The device isn't up there.

268
00:30:50,963 --> 00:30:53,296
And Mom isn't here. Neither is Martha.

269
00:30:55,713 --> 00:30:57,296
Do you think she's with him?

270
00:30:58,255 --> 00:30:59,463
With Jonas?

271
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:03,505
Noah was right.
He was right about everything.

272
00:31:03,796 --> 00:31:05,421
I told you guys.

273
00:31:05,505 --> 00:31:08,005
Jonas is to blame for all this shit.

274
00:31:19,963 --> 00:31:21,630
Where are we going?

275
00:31:34,755 --> 00:31:37,880
You have to take it to the bunker.
Near Helge's cabin.

276
00:31:38,921 --> 00:31:40,505
You don't have much time.

277
00:31:42,671 --> 00:31:44,088
And you?

278
00:31:47,671 --> 00:31:49,338
I have to find my mother.

279
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:51,380
And Martha.

280
00:31:55,963 --> 00:31:57,046
Jonas!

281
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:08,421
TWO HOURS UNTIL THE APOCALYPSE

282
00:32:09,005 --> 00:32:11,463
Hey, Martha! Call me back.

283
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:15,630
Neither is answering.

284
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:29,005
My father is with Elisabeth in the bunker.

285
00:32:30,088 --> 00:32:32,505
- He says I should join him.
- In the bunker?

286
00:32:33,755 --> 00:32:34,755
Shit.

287
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,463
Something's happening.

288
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:41,005
I have to go there.

289
00:32:43,838 --> 00:32:47,338
If they're not here in 30 minutes,
we'll go join your father.

290
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:59,921
Where are Mom and Franziska?

291
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:03,796
I don't know.

292
00:33:07,963 --> 00:33:10,921
So Noah says he's your father
and comes from the future.

293
00:33:11,005 --> 00:33:12,963
No, from the past.

294
00:33:13,046 --> 00:33:16,255
And he said the apocalypse
will begin here in Winden.

295
00:33:16,338 --> 00:33:17,421
Today!

296
00:33:17,505 --> 00:33:20,796
And you think it all has to do
with the barrels.

297
00:33:49,463 --> 00:33:52,546
- What is that?
- The cooling pool for the old reactor.

298
00:33:53,005 --> 00:33:56,463
It has already been sealed
to become part of the green field.

299
00:33:56,546 --> 00:33:57,671
When?

300
00:33:58,296 --> 00:33:59,588
I, um...

301
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:01,671
don't know exactly.

302
00:34:02,421 --> 00:34:04,255
But it's nothing unusual.

303
00:34:04,338 --> 00:34:06,088
Sealing off the old reactor

304
00:34:06,588 --> 00:34:08,755
is a step in the dismantling process.

305
00:34:09,796 --> 00:34:11,588
I want it broken open.

306
00:34:13,046 --> 00:34:14,546
Now?

307
00:34:15,213 --> 00:34:16,296
Now.

308
00:34:17,713 --> 00:34:21,380
You can't keep him there another night.
He's done nothing wrong.

309
00:34:21,838 --> 00:34:23,588
This is all nonsense.

310
00:34:29,171 --> 00:34:31,130
When can I visit Aleksander?

311
00:34:35,046 --> 00:34:36,421
I understand.

312
00:34:42,088 --> 00:34:43,505
Regina?

313
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:04,380
Please don't be afraid.

314
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,838
It's really me.

315
00:35:20,338 --> 00:35:22,005
I'm so sorry.

316
00:35:24,213 --> 00:35:26,088
I didn't want to just leave that way.

317
00:35:27,963 --> 00:35:29,463
I'll explain it to you.

318
00:35:32,838 --> 00:35:34,713
Buy you have to come with me now.

319
00:35:43,755 --> 00:35:45,171
Regina.

320
00:35:49,171 --> 00:35:50,880
I'm so sorry.

321
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,130
Noah?

322
00:36:22,588 --> 00:36:24,213
You look different.

323
00:36:26,463 --> 00:36:28,546
Different to when I saw you last.

324
00:36:30,005 --> 00:36:31,421
He sent you.

325
00:36:32,546 --> 00:36:33,630
Adam.

326
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:37,421
I always wondered when you became him.

327
00:36:37,505 --> 00:36:39,213
I won't do that.

328
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:41,630
I'll never do what he did.

329
00:36:43,213 --> 00:36:45,421
He said you'd say something like that.

330
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:49,921
He also said we'd become friends.

331
00:36:52,046 --> 00:36:53,630
Before you betray me.

332
00:36:56,963 --> 00:36:58,796
Why do you follow him?

333
00:36:59,463 --> 00:37:01,171
Why did you follow her?

334
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:03,671
Claudia.

335
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,505
Because we want to believe.

336
00:37:06,588 --> 00:37:09,838
Because we cling to the salvation
promised to us.

337
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,713
If you kill him...

338
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:20,630
you kill all hope of salvation.

339
00:37:22,421 --> 00:37:24,046
He's the savior.

340
00:37:29,088 --> 00:37:30,630
You're the savior.

341
00:37:40,171 --> 00:37:42,755
- What is that?
- Read it.

342
00:37:44,213 --> 00:37:45,671
It's from Martha.

343
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,338
This is impossible.

344
00:38:08,505 --> 00:38:10,005
You must save them.

345
00:38:11,505 --> 00:38:14,713
Bartosz, Magnus and Franziska.

346
00:38:16,046 --> 00:38:17,588
And later me and Agnes.

347
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:23,088
The loop has to be closed
so the next cycle begins.

348
00:38:24,796 --> 00:38:26,713
As the prophesy dictates.

349
00:38:27,546 --> 00:38:29,296
And so Martha can live.

350
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,588
No, this can't be.

351
00:38:38,296 --> 00:38:39,463
Martha!

352
00:40:37,046 --> 00:40:38,046
Regina.

353
00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:49,838
You're her.

354
00:40:53,505 --> 00:40:54,588
You're Claudia.

355
00:41:16,171 --> 00:41:18,130
FOLLOW THE SIGNAL

356
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:45,088
Your colleague is in the old reactor.

357
00:42:24,171 --> 00:42:25,296
Mom?

358
00:42:31,713 --> 00:42:32,921
Jonas?

359
00:42:47,963 --> 00:42:49,546
You're back.

360
00:42:53,005 --> 00:42:54,588
You really came back.

361
00:42:58,671 --> 00:43:00,338
I've been looking for you.

362
00:43:03,171 --> 00:43:05,171
- I have to tell you something.
- I know.

363
00:43:05,921 --> 00:43:07,130
Everything.

364
00:43:08,213 --> 00:43:10,338
I know why you said that
back then in the rain.

365
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,421
Mikkel...

366
00:43:12,505 --> 00:43:14,005
I know everything.

367
00:43:16,796 --> 00:43:18,463
It was you at the lake.

368
00:43:48,171 --> 00:43:50,046
We're a perfect match.

369
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:52,713
Don't ever believe anything else.

370
00:44:17,171 --> 00:44:19,005
And so the circle closes.

371
00:44:22,213 --> 00:44:23,630
Jonas, who is that?

372
00:44:25,963 --> 00:44:27,838
Go on, tell her who I am.

373
00:44:35,296 --> 00:44:38,755
I told you that all the pieces
are in their places.

374
00:44:39,671 --> 00:44:41,671
All that's needed is a little push.

375
00:44:41,755 --> 00:44:43,255
You lied to me!

376
00:44:45,005 --> 00:44:46,880
You wanted it all to happen again.

377
00:44:47,505 --> 00:44:48,796
You're the trigger.

378
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:51,255
We're all the trigger.

379
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:54,088
Each and every one of us.

380
00:44:54,963 --> 00:44:56,463
Why do you want that?

381
00:44:57,546 --> 00:45:00,005
Why do you want the future to be repeated?

382
00:45:01,505 --> 00:45:05,671
Because what is created today
is the beginning of the end.

383
00:45:06,713 --> 00:45:08,380
The dark matter,

384
00:45:08,463 --> 00:45:12,505
it has to be created so that in the future
I can lead it to its new purpose.

385
00:45:13,921 --> 00:45:15,380
The end of this world.

386
00:45:18,296 --> 00:45:19,921
I am the trigger.

387
00:45:22,213 --> 00:45:24,088
Only not of what you think.

388
00:45:28,671 --> 00:45:30,713
I am the trigger

389
00:45:31,838 --> 00:45:35,213
that will make you become what I am today.

390
00:45:54,838 --> 00:45:55,713
It's okay.

391
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:58,505
It will all be okay.

392
00:45:58,588 --> 00:46:00,963
Some pain is unforgettable.

393
00:46:03,838 --> 00:46:06,255
You will carry this pain for the rest
of your life.

394
00:46:06,338 --> 00:46:07,921
Look at me.

395
00:46:09,713 --> 00:46:11,963
Until you're finally ready

396
00:46:13,671 --> 00:46:15,130
to let go.

397
00:46:19,755 --> 00:46:21,380
Of her, too.

398
00:46:31,755 --> 00:46:33,088
You can stop me.

399
00:46:35,963 --> 00:46:37,755
Or try to save her.

400
00:46:45,463 --> 00:46:47,421
You'll know what to do.

401
00:46:54,671 --> 00:46:56,421
Please, don't go.

402
00:46:57,630 --> 00:46:58,755
Martha!

403
00:47:00,046 --> 00:47:01,505
Please don't go.

404
00:47:04,213 --> 00:47:05,213
Please don't.

405
00:47:18,005 --> 00:47:19,380
Don't open it!

406
00:47:20,005 --> 00:47:23,255
Stop! Don't open it! It's a mistake.

407
00:47:24,255 --> 00:47:27,005
No, Mrs. Doppler. It's our elephant.

408
00:47:27,088 --> 00:47:29,130
You have no idea
what this is really about.

409
00:47:30,505 --> 00:47:33,380
- What is it this really about?
- Not about the missing people.

410
00:47:33,838 --> 00:47:35,380
It's about the future,

411
00:47:35,463 --> 00:47:37,005
the past

412
00:47:37,088 --> 00:47:38,921
and how it's all interconnected.

413
00:47:41,213 --> 00:47:42,421
- Open it.
- Please don't!

414
00:47:42,505 --> 00:47:44,630
- Open it.
- No, it's a mistake!

415
00:47:55,796 --> 00:47:58,005
Magnus! Open up!

416
00:47:58,088 --> 00:47:59,171
Magnus!

417
00:47:59,255 --> 00:48:00,588
Open the door!

418
00:48:00,671 --> 00:48:01,713
Hurry!

419
00:48:02,505 --> 00:48:03,671
Magnus!

420
00:48:05,046 --> 00:48:07,588
What the hell? Who are you? Hey!

421
00:48:10,963 --> 00:48:13,463
It's him. It's you.

422
00:48:14,213 --> 00:48:15,296
You're Jonas.

423
00:48:16,171 --> 00:48:17,630
It's all your fault.

424
00:48:17,713 --> 00:48:19,630
Yes, it is my fault, all of it.

425
00:48:19,713 --> 00:48:22,005
- But I'm here to save you.
- Save us from what?

426
00:48:22,796 --> 00:48:25,171
- From the apocalypse.
- What apocalypse?

427
00:48:26,171 --> 00:48:27,796
What about Martha?

428
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:31,046
What about Martha?

429
00:49:36,755 --> 00:49:38,505
FOR CHARLOTTE

430
00:51:32,296 --> 00:51:33,755
Mom.

431
00:51:36,005 --> 00:51:37,338
Elisabeth.

432
00:51:51,755 --> 00:51:53,338
It's beginning.

433
00:51:59,338 --> 00:52:00,963
Where are we going?

434
00:52:39,588 --> 00:52:40,838
I promise you.

435
00:52:42,338 --> 00:52:43,630
I'll make it right.

436
00:53:17,171 --> 00:53:19,255
I'm not who you think I am.

437
00:53:24,755 --> 00:53:28,296
- Wait. Martha, that's not possible, I...
- We don't have time.

438
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:39,046
I'll explain it to you later.
We have to go now.

439
00:53:49,671 --> 00:53:51,005
What time are you from?

440
00:53:53,296 --> 00:53:55,505
The question isn't from what time,

441
00:53:56,463 --> 00:53:57,880
but from what world.
