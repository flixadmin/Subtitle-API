1
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:03,588
<i>In 2166,</i>

2
00:00:03,797 --> 00:00:06,007
<i>an immortal tyrant
named Vandal Savage</i>

3
00:00:06,257 --> 00:00:08,677
<i>conquered the world
and murdered my wife and child.</i>

4
00:00:08,927 --> 00:00:10,136
<i>I have assembled an elite team</i>

5
00:00:10,345 --> 00:00:13,098
<i>to hunt him throughout time
and stop his rise to power.</i>

6
00:00:13,264 --> 00:00:15,266
<i>Unfortunately,
my plan is opposed by</i>

7
00:00:15,433 --> 00:00:17,143
<i>the body I had
sworn my allegiance to,</i>

8
00:00:17,352 --> 00:00:18,687
<i>the Time Masters.</i>

9
00:00:18,937 --> 00:00:21,106
<i>In the future,
my friends may not be heroes,</i>

10
00:00:21,314 --> 00:00:22,607
<i>but if we succeed,</i>

11
00:00:23,024 --> 00:00:25,694
<i>they will be remembered as legends.</i>

12
00:00:28,321 --> 00:00:30,198
<i>Previously, on</i>
Legends of Tomorrow...

13
00:00:30,448 --> 00:00:32,593
<i>Savage has kept his movements
hidden throughout history. But--</i>

14
00:00:32,617 --> 00:00:35,286
<i>Professor Aldus Boardman
is the world's leading expert.</i>

15
00:00:35,495 --> 00:00:37,288
<i>Savage was an Egyptian priest.</i>

16
00:00:37,497 --> 00:00:38,641
<i>Kendra and I reincarnate.</i>

17
00:00:38,665 --> 00:00:40,792
And every time he kills you,
it passes to him.

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,836
That's what maintains
his immortality.

19
00:00:43,378 --> 00:00:46,131
<i>Professor Boardman has
sustained severe internal injuries.</i>

20
00:00:46,297 --> 00:00:47,298
A hundred years from now,

21
00:00:47,465 --> 00:00:49,801
<i>your lives have minimal effect
on the recorded timeline.</i>

22
00:00:49,968 --> 00:00:51,010
You lied to us.

23
00:00:51,177 --> 00:00:52,863
<i>I don't give a damn
about being a legend,</i>

24
00:00:52,887 --> 00:00:54,889
as long as we end Savage
once and for all.

25
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,016
So how do we find this guy?

26
00:01:03,231 --> 00:01:04,983
And, we've arrived.

27
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:06,711
Gideon, if you wouldn't mind
camouflaging us

28
00:01:06,735 --> 00:01:08,319
as an Alpine meadow, perhaps.

29
00:01:08,528 --> 00:01:11,006
What're you complaining about now?
It's not like we time-jumped.

30
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:14,534
I hate flying. Especially in...
Whatever this thing is.

31
00:01:15,034 --> 00:01:16,494
Where exactly are we?

32
00:01:16,661 --> 00:01:18,496
We're still in 1975, right?

33
00:01:18,663 --> 00:01:22,250
Indeed. October 19th, 1975.
On the fjords of Northern Norway.

34
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,501
Sounds like a vacation.

35
00:01:23,668 --> 00:01:25,479
Which we can take as soon
as the threat of Savage

36
00:01:25,503 --> 00:01:26,921
has been neutralized, Mister Snart.

37
00:01:27,172 --> 00:01:28,256
That's Aldus' notebook.

38
00:01:28,506 --> 00:01:31,176
Now, he theorized
that Savage might be here.

39
00:01:31,384 --> 00:01:33,070
And, if he's right,
and if we can capture Savage,

40
00:01:33,094 --> 00:01:35,221
then at least Professor Boardman
didn't die in vain.

41
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,515
Can't we just go back
and save Aldus?

42
00:01:37,891 --> 00:01:39,225
He was our son.

43
00:01:39,434 --> 00:01:41,060
Look, I'm sorry.

44
00:01:41,269 --> 00:01:43,629
We can't go back and change events
in which we participated.

45
00:01:43,772 --> 00:01:46,012
Time would fold in on itself,
creating a temporal vortex.

46
00:01:46,191 --> 00:01:47,692
Which sounds way cooler than it is.

47
00:01:48,026 --> 00:01:49,861
Forgetting physics for a second,

48
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:52,530
shouldn't we figure out
what Savage is doing in Norway?

49
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:55,593
According to Gideon, there's a large
meeting of terrorists and fringe groups

50
00:01:55,617 --> 00:01:56,868
looking to buy illegal arms.

51
00:01:57,076 --> 00:01:59,204
Now, that sounds like a vacation.

52
00:01:59,412 --> 00:02:02,373
Arms dealers and terrorists
aren't exactly our kind of people,

53
00:02:02,582 --> 00:02:04,083
but they're the next best thing.

54
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:07,212
Well, looks like you and your lapdog
get to earn your keep.

55
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,631
I'm no one's lapdog, birdman.

56
00:02:09,881 --> 00:02:13,551
So, what exactly does one wear to
a black market arms bazaar, anyway?

57
00:02:13,718 --> 00:02:15,118
The <i>Waverider</i> has
a fabrication room

58
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:18,306
which can fashion temporally
indigenous fashion.

59
00:02:18,973 --> 00:02:20,558
You've got a room
that makes clothing?

60
00:02:20,725 --> 00:02:21,976
Doesn't everyone?

61
00:02:22,727 --> 00:02:25,063
All right. First thing we need
to do is work up a plan.

62
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,982
Got a lot of experience
infiltrating criminal gatherings?

63
00:02:28,233 --> 00:02:30,235
Didn't think so.
I'm calling the shots.

64
00:02:30,401 --> 00:02:32,641
Actually, I'm in charge,
in case any of you've forgotten.

65
00:02:32,779 --> 00:02:35,073
No, I remember. I just don't care.

66
00:02:35,281 --> 00:02:37,218
Do I need to remind any of you
that I am a Time Master?

67
00:02:37,242 --> 00:02:40,078
Making discrete alterations
to the timeline is what I do.

68
00:02:40,286 --> 00:02:41,639
So we're not going to
charge into the past

69
00:02:41,663 --> 00:02:42,807
like a bull into a china shop.

70
00:02:42,831 --> 00:02:45,917
Half of what you've told us about
the mission turned out to be lies.

71
00:02:46,084 --> 00:02:49,087
None of you have ever encountered
Vandal Savage before.

72
00:02:49,671 --> 00:02:50,797
I have.

73
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:53,508
And I am telling you now,
you are making a big mistake.

74
00:02:53,758 --> 00:02:56,678
Already did that when we trusted you.

75
00:02:57,095 --> 00:02:58,930
Back soon, Captain.

76
00:03:09,274 --> 00:03:12,485
Looks like they're checking
credentials. And we don't have any.

77
00:03:12,694 --> 00:03:14,362
We got this. Trust us.

78
00:03:16,948 --> 00:03:18,533
Excuse you.

79
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,368
IDs.

80
00:03:24,956 --> 00:03:27,500
You don't look like
an "Amhad Ahmed Izz-Al-Din."

81
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:30,295
I'm Arab on my mother's side.

82
00:03:30,503 --> 00:03:32,130
Is there a problem?

83
00:03:34,048 --> 00:03:36,050
I don't like delays.

84
00:03:36,301 --> 00:03:37,969
Do you know who we are?

85
00:03:38,136 --> 00:03:41,472
My associates and I are
the operational arm of "Scimitar."

86
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:44,183
The Lombardo Square bombing, 1963.

87
00:03:44,392 --> 00:03:47,020
<i>Murder of Henri Tyran, Canada, 1970.</i>

88
00:03:47,228 --> 00:03:50,648
Koenig Airport Massacre, 1971.

89
00:03:51,149 --> 00:03:52,650
Bottom line,

90
00:03:53,902 --> 00:03:56,070
you don't want to doubt me.

91
00:04:02,619 --> 00:04:05,079
You're a special kind of crazy.
I like it.

92
00:04:06,748 --> 00:04:08,207
We're in.

93
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:14,984
So, why don't I
get to play terrorist?

94
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:18,676
<i>This is just a kidnapping.
No need for your nuclear fireworks.</i>

95
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,931
Savage'll be one of the buyers.
Once we get eyes on, hang back.

96
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:25,600
We'll boost him
once this is all over.

97
00:04:28,561 --> 00:04:29,687
Any sign of him?

98
00:04:29,896 --> 00:04:32,231
- No.
- He's not here, boss.

99
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,525
Let's get Ginger and
the Professor and move out.

100
00:04:34,734 --> 00:04:36,653
<i>If I could
have your attention...</i>

101
00:04:36,861 --> 00:04:38,780
Thank you all for coming.

102
00:04:38,988 --> 00:04:41,824
I promise,
it will be well worth your time.

103
00:04:43,117 --> 00:04:47,121
Seems we were wrong about Savage.
He's not one of the buyers.

104
00:04:48,957 --> 00:04:50,375
He's the seller.

105
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:54,087
This is a variable-yield
nuclear warhead,

106
00:04:54,295 --> 00:05:00,259
capable of producing a blast
equivalent to one megaton of TNT.

107
00:05:00,635 --> 00:05:04,305
Shall we begin our bidding
at $100 million?

108
00:05:04,597 --> 00:05:06,432
One hundred million.

109
00:05:06,933 --> 00:05:08,810
Do I hear 105?

110
00:05:09,435 --> 00:05:11,020
One hundred and ten?

111
00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:13,022
One hundred and fifteen?

112
00:05:14,107 --> 00:05:15,608
Is everything all right, sir?

113
00:05:17,235 --> 00:05:18,444
They're here.

114
00:05:22,532 --> 00:05:23,908
<i>That group.</i>

115
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,618
Where are they from?

116
00:05:25,827 --> 00:05:28,097
Appears we've drawn some
unwanted attention. We need to bid.

117
00:05:28,121 --> 00:05:29,288
Fire your gun in the air.

118
00:05:30,832 --> 00:05:32,667
That's 125.

119
00:05:33,042 --> 00:05:34,085
What's happening?

120
00:05:34,252 --> 00:05:36,129
It's what's not happening
that is the concern.

121
00:05:36,337 --> 00:05:37,964
- Nobody else is bidding.
- Sold!

122
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:39,674
Congratulations, Professor.

123
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:42,176
You just bought yourself
a nuclear weapon.

124
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:45,013
Well, well,
we seem to have a new player.

125
00:05:45,513 --> 00:05:46,793
Well, you seem a bit "academic."

126
00:05:46,848 --> 00:05:48,850
How'd you get in here
and who are you?

127
00:05:49,058 --> 00:05:52,478
As of a few seconds ago,
I'm a nuclear power.

128
00:05:52,687 --> 00:05:54,647
Yet, I don't know you
or your organization.

129
00:05:54,856 --> 00:05:56,107
And I know everyone.

130
00:05:56,315 --> 00:05:58,943
- Hey, back off.
- Watch your tone.

131
00:05:59,152 --> 00:06:01,446
- Is there some sort of problem here?
- Yeah.

132
00:06:01,654 --> 00:06:03,740
The Master Race here
is starting to bug me.

133
00:06:03,948 --> 00:06:06,701
We're just gonna get our nuclear
warhead and be on our way.

134
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:08,453
Not without paying first.

135
00:06:08,661 --> 00:06:11,664
Once we've validated
that the warhead's operational.

136
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:14,959
Personally, I find it highly unlikely
that you were able to accumulate

137
00:06:15,168 --> 00:06:17,837
enough fissionable
material in this era

138
00:06:18,046 --> 00:06:20,757
to fashion
a workable nuclear device.

139
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:23,259
This era?

140
00:06:26,095 --> 00:06:27,889
Figure of speech.

141
00:06:28,431 --> 00:06:29,766
I've got a feeling
you guys might

142
00:06:29,974 --> 00:06:31,934
want to get those
helmets of yours on.

143
00:06:33,603 --> 00:06:35,063
Change of plans.

144
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:38,900
I'll provide a 25% discount

145
00:06:39,108 --> 00:06:43,404
to the organization which
brings me the heads of these men.

146
00:06:43,613 --> 00:06:45,114
Can I burn some stuff now?

147
00:06:45,323 --> 00:06:46,783
I wish you would.

148
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:01,589
- Now would be a good time.
- Yeah. To kill you.

149
00:07:01,798 --> 00:07:03,633
I wasn't talking to you.

150
00:08:05,278 --> 00:08:06,362
Savage.

151
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:07,947
Prince Khufu.

152
00:08:08,406 --> 00:08:10,825
As always, the fashion plate.

153
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:13,661
And, your better half...

154
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:16,747
This ends here and now, Savage.
You're coming with us.

155
00:08:16,956 --> 00:08:21,169
I doubt you can apprehend me
and stop a nuclear explosion.

156
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:39,437
- You screwed that up pretty good!
- I had it handled.

157
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:41,981
I like how you actually believe that.

158
00:08:48,404 --> 00:08:50,448
Um, we've got a nuclear bomb here.

159
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:57,246
Ray! What did you do?

160
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:01,716
I didn't do anything!
It must have a failsafe!

161
00:09:01,918 --> 00:09:03,753
Professor, Jax, we need you!

162
00:09:12,637 --> 00:09:15,097
<i>You have to get
to a minimum safe distance.</i>

163
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:18,643
Okay, what now?

164
00:09:18,851 --> 00:09:20,454
<i>We wait
for the warhead to go off.</i>

165
00:09:20,478 --> 00:09:22,855
<i>At which point,
you're going to have 0.06 seconds</i>

166
00:09:23,064 --> 00:09:25,233
<i>to absorb the massive release
of atomic energy.</i>

167
00:09:25,441 --> 00:09:27,068
Your plan sucks.
You know that, right?

168
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:28,945
<i>Concentrate, Jefferson.</i>

169
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:58,408
Well, I'm really glad
you were the one calling the shots.

170
00:09:58,432 --> 00:09:59,517
I had it under control

171
00:09:59,684 --> 00:10:02,812
until the Professor started
picking fights with the PLO.

172
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,022
You let your ego
endanger our entire mission.

173
00:10:05,231 --> 00:10:07,151
No, Mister Rory's temper
got completely out of --

174
00:10:07,191 --> 00:10:08,818
I thought we were friends, Professor.

175
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:11,612
At least, there's one less
nuclear bomb on the planet.

176
00:10:13,739 --> 00:10:17,368
Hear, hear. You all deserve
a hearty congratulations.

177
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:19,787
<i>Not only did you
fail to capture Savage,</i>

178
00:10:19,996 --> 00:10:21,956
but you exposed yourselves
and your powers to him,

179
00:10:22,164 --> 00:10:24,959
giving away the element
of surprise for now and all time.

180
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:26,210
Well done, team!

181
00:10:26,377 --> 00:10:27,937
We don't need
the "element of surprise."

182
00:10:28,004 --> 00:10:29,844
We know he's here in Norway.
So let's find him.

183
00:10:30,006 --> 00:10:31,775
Unfortunately, we now have
larger problems than Savage.

184
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:33,079
If only you'd have
listened to me

185
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:34,653
about the dangers
of upsetting the timeline.

186
00:10:34,677 --> 00:10:35,761
What are you talking about?

187
00:10:35,928 --> 00:10:38,156
While you were busy saving
Norway from nuclear annihilation--

188
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,390
You're welcome, Norway!

189
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:42,158
Savage sent one of his cronies
back to the site of the arms sale.

190
00:10:42,226 --> 00:10:43,894
Anyone care to guess what he found?

191
00:10:48,232 --> 00:10:49,317
Oops.

192
00:10:50,234 --> 00:10:52,737
<i>I'm unversed in
modern American colloquialisms.</i>

193
00:10:52,945 --> 00:10:54,196
<i>Is "Oops" slang for--</i>

194
00:10:54,405 --> 00:10:56,845
Yes, Doctor Palmer seems to have
thrown a spanner in the works

195
00:10:57,033 --> 00:10:58,868
- for the entire timeline.
- Come again?

196
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:00,721
Armed with Doctor Palmer's
future technology,

197
00:11:00,745 --> 00:11:02,145
Savage's engineers develop a weapon

198
00:11:02,246 --> 00:11:04,790
far more destructive
than anything here in 1975.

199
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:08,252
This is Central City in 2016.
At least it was.

200
00:11:08,461 --> 00:11:09,661
I'm not sure what neo-fascists

201
00:11:09,795 --> 00:11:11,715
who took control of it
are calling it these days.

202
00:11:16,635 --> 00:11:18,804
There must be a way
to correct this somehow.

203
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:20,931
Fortunately,
Gideon is just showing us

204
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,225
a forecast of the future
you've all created.

205
00:11:23,434 --> 00:11:27,271
Time is like cement,
it takes time to become permanent.

206
00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:29,899
In this case,
until Savage's team have worked out

207
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:33,736
the mystery of your future technology
and molded it to their own ends.

208
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:39,492
And, when they do, what you see here
is no longer just a forecast.

209
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,785
This...

210
00:11:43,788 --> 00:11:45,289
This is history.

211
00:12:02,056 --> 00:12:03,140
Where is he?

212
00:12:03,641 --> 00:12:06,310
His body, I mean.

213
00:12:06,644 --> 00:12:09,146
There's cryo-storage in the MedBay.

214
00:12:10,815 --> 00:12:13,442
I promise we'll get our son
a proper burial once we have a chance.

215
00:12:13,651 --> 00:12:16,320
It's still so weird
to hear you call him that.

216
00:12:18,239 --> 00:12:21,409
But even though it was in a past life,

217
00:12:21,617 --> 00:12:23,661
it feels like something's missing.

218
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:24,995
I know.

219
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:27,456
What's that?

220
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,709
I found it in his pocket.

221
00:12:31,544 --> 00:12:33,879
I've seen this knife before.

222
00:12:37,842 --> 00:12:40,010
This is the knife
that Savage used to kill us.

223
00:12:40,219 --> 00:12:41,345
In our first life.

224
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,850
So thanks to Raymond leaving
a piece of his suit in the past,

225
00:12:46,058 --> 00:12:49,270
the rest of us don't have
a future to go back to...

226
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:52,189
Unless we do something
to change this course of events.

227
00:12:52,398 --> 00:12:54,525
The future will become immutable.

228
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:56,610
Exactly how much time do we have?

229
00:12:56,819 --> 00:12:59,447
Until Savage's weapons team
reverse-engineer your tech.

230
00:12:59,655 --> 00:13:03,325
We're talking 1970s terrorists
with 21st century weapons?

231
00:13:03,534 --> 00:13:05,254
And since we don't know
where Savage went...

232
00:13:05,286 --> 00:13:06,996
We don't have to find Savage,

233
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:09,623
we just have to find
the other piece of my suit!

234
00:13:09,832 --> 00:13:11,184
Which shrinks
because it's made of an alloy

235
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:13,520
which mimics the intra-molecular
compression of a dwarf star,

236
00:13:13,544 --> 00:13:14,837
thus emitting Alpha particles.

237
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:17,047
So we just need to
be able to track them.

238
00:13:17,256 --> 00:13:19,300
Fortunately,
Alpha particles are highly trackable.

239
00:13:19,508 --> 00:13:21,635
Yet unheard of in the 1970s.

240
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:23,530
It's like we're trapped
in the Stone Age.

241
00:13:23,554 --> 00:13:25,782
I will have you know that
I was researching Alpha particles

242
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:27,224
when you were eating crayons!

243
00:13:27,433 --> 00:13:31,479
So to track that piece of Raymond's
super-suit we just need to talk to--

244
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:34,440
Me. 25-year-old me, rather.

245
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:36,066
<i>You two are just in time.</i>

246
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:37,485
Show them, Kendra.

247
00:13:37,693 --> 00:13:39,528
Aldus was carrying this
when he was killed.

248
00:13:39,737 --> 00:13:42,031
It's a newspaper article
about an Egyptian dagger.

249
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:43,949
The one Savage used to kill us.

250
00:13:44,158 --> 00:13:45,385
In Central City,
we learned that

251
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:47,369
objects associated with
the night of our deaths,

252
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:48,954
can also be used to kill Savage.

253
00:13:49,163 --> 00:13:51,766
According to Aldus' notes, the dagger
needs to be wielded in conjunction

254
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,501
<i>with an incantation inscribed on it.</i>

255
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:55,961
Well, what does this incantation say?

256
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:58,964
I don't know.
I can't read the language.

257
00:13:59,715 --> 00:14:01,592
It's okay. I'll help you remember.

258
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,762
- Splendid. Now, as for the dagger...
- You need someone to steal it?

259
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:07,097
Okay, fine. Whatever. I'll do it.

260
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:10,935
Article says that it was purchased
by some rich Russian douchebag

261
00:14:11,143 --> 00:14:12,728
named Sasha Mahnovski.

262
00:14:13,437 --> 00:14:15,237
- I'll go with you.
- I already got a partner.

263
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:16,607
Who I trust even less than you.

264
00:14:16,941 --> 00:14:18,460
Look, you're more than welcome
to go with him,

265
00:14:18,484 --> 00:14:20,528
just don't take along
your future-tech.

266
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:24,698
Oi! Where do you think you are going?

267
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,469
To break into my old lab and
bring us back the particle tracker.

268
00:14:27,493 --> 00:14:30,120
Fine. Perhaps you should take
Jefferson and Sara with you

269
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:32,164
<i>to act as your intermediaries.</i>

270
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:34,542
Interacting with yourself
in the past

271
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,336
can have catastrophic effects
upon the future.

272
00:14:37,628 --> 00:14:39,630
Fascinating. Let's go.

273
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,550
<i>Setting a course
for the United States, Captain.</i>

274
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,810
People actually wore this crap?

275
00:14:52,977 --> 00:14:54,687
People smoked
a lot of pot in the '70s,

276
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:57,648
it clearly had a deleterious effect
on the fashion of the era.

277
00:14:57,856 --> 00:14:59,858
Let's just hurry up
and get that particle tracker

278
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:01,986
so I can get the hell
out of these go-go boots.

279
00:15:02,194 --> 00:15:04,697
When we meet my former self,
it's imperative

280
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:06,508
that we don't let on
we're from the future.

281
00:15:06,532 --> 00:15:09,201
So, let's just be cool.

282
00:15:11,412 --> 00:15:12,871
Oh, my God.

283
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:15,082
Look.

284
00:15:17,376 --> 00:15:19,336
I had forgotten how handsome I was.

285
00:15:19,545 --> 00:15:22,798
My hair, it's so thick and silky.

286
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:30,055
Do I know you?

287
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:33,851
No, no. I... I'm Professor Musk.

288
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:35,644
Elon Musk.

289
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:37,646
And these are my two lab assistants.

290
00:15:37,855 --> 00:15:39,815
Hi. I'm Marty.

291
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:43,193
Are you sure we haven't met before?

292
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,114
It's a very interesting question.

293
00:15:47,615 --> 00:15:50,367
Suffice it to say,
I'm familiar with your work.

294
00:15:50,576 --> 00:15:53,037
That's actually why we're here.
To see you.

295
00:15:53,245 --> 00:15:55,873
You're a leading expert
in Alpha particles?

296
00:15:56,081 --> 00:15:58,876
No, I'm "The" leading expert.

297
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:03,172
Well, we were hoping to pick your
brain about your area of expertise.

298
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,423
Physics?

299
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:06,884
Which are you interested in?
Applied or theoretical?

300
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:09,261
That is just the thing.

301
00:16:09,762 --> 00:16:11,722
I can't decide.

302
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,724
I love them both!

303
00:16:14,266 --> 00:16:15,643
Cool.

304
00:16:15,851 --> 00:16:19,480
Well, let's go spark a "doobie"
and rap about physics.

305
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:22,441
Lead the way, Marty.

306
00:16:27,905 --> 00:16:31,116
Uh...
Are you sure that's actually you?

307
00:16:32,284 --> 00:16:34,119
Oh, man.

308
00:16:36,372 --> 00:16:39,249
Concentrate, Kendra.
You know how to read the inscription.

309
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:40,584
At least, you used to know.

310
00:16:40,793 --> 00:16:42,628
Yeah. Well,
my hieroglyphic is a little rusty.

311
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:44,276
<i>Lapidary hieratic, actually.</i>

312
00:16:44,463 --> 00:16:45,923
<i>An ancient language
lost to the ages.</i>

313
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:47,424
Don't you know how to read it?

314
00:16:47,633 --> 00:16:49,277
It was a language known
only to the clergy.

315
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:51,720
<i>If we only had a Rosetta Stone.
I might be able to--</i>

316
00:16:51,929 --> 00:16:54,723
Well, you are our Rosetta Stone.

317
00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:57,476
Just close your eyes.

318
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:02,231
Think of it as meditation. I need
you to relax, and open your mind.

319
00:17:04,483 --> 00:17:06,819
In order for you to remember
how to kill Savage,

320
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:09,071
I need you to let your mind float.

321
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:12,282
Back through
your hundreds of previous lives.

322
00:17:16,495 --> 00:17:19,498
Your name is Chay-Ara,

323
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:23,043
and you are a priestess
in the temple of Horus.

324
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:32,970
What? What is it?

325
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:34,430
Us.

326
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,933
We were together.

327
00:17:38,142 --> 00:17:39,810
Like, "together" together.

328
00:17:40,352 --> 00:17:43,355
Well, I have been telling you
that you and I should be destined...

329
00:17:43,564 --> 00:17:44,606
What are you doing?

330
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:47,443
What part of "destiny"
do you not understand?

331
00:17:47,651 --> 00:17:50,279
The part where I have to stop
thinking for myself.

332
00:18:00,706 --> 00:18:02,499
The group that disrupted
the arms auction...

333
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:03,751
Any idea who they were?

334
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:07,713
A man in a robotic suit,
weapons that shoot ice and fire...

335
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:10,215
Suffice it to say,
they're not from around here.

336
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:11,925
I would assume the future.

337
00:18:12,134 --> 00:18:14,762
- That's impossible.
- So is immortality.

338
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:16,502
Besides, how else
do you explain

339
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:19,558
technology beyond
anything we've seen?

340
00:18:22,895 --> 00:18:24,897
What can you tell me about it?

341
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:27,065
It contains a miniaturized
missile guidance system

342
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:30,486
capable of delivering
high-explosive ordnance.

343
00:18:30,694 --> 00:18:33,322
You have 24 hours
to reverse-engineer it.

344
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:37,326
It could take weeks,
months to figure out the circuitry!

345
00:18:41,997 --> 00:18:43,957
It looks simple enough to me.

346
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:47,795
You just press this button here.

347
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:55,302
I said 24 hours.

348
00:18:56,178 --> 00:18:58,180
I suggest you all get to work.

349
00:19:04,228 --> 00:19:06,939
I'm seeing motion-detectors
on the ground floor,

350
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:09,399
hardware on the doors
looks standard-issue.

351
00:19:09,608 --> 00:19:11,944
- I can't see any smoke alarms...
- Just stay close.

352
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:14,571
I saw at least three armed guards
on the perimeter.

353
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,281
All right, boss.

354
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:18,301
- What the hell are you--
- I recognize the security system.

355
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:19,485
My parents had the exact one.

356
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,515
I'll have the access code cracked
and security disabled

357
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:25,141
before you can say
"breaking and entering."

358
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:26,708
There. We're in.

359
00:19:27,376 --> 00:19:28,961
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

360
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:30,170
Why's that?

361
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:31,898
Because you just
tapped into a dummy box.

362
00:19:31,922 --> 00:19:34,299
Which means
those guards are going to be here--

363
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:36,385
Quicker than you can say
"rookie mistake."

364
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:37,803
Hands up.

365
00:19:43,517 --> 00:19:44,601
Huh.

366
00:19:48,272 --> 00:19:51,149
- So, who wants a hit?
- Yeah, man.

367
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:53,078
I believe you told me
you're trying to quit.

368
00:19:53,277 --> 00:19:54,862
None for you, silver top?

369
00:19:58,031 --> 00:20:00,993
I don't partake in cannabis...

370
00:20:02,995 --> 00:20:07,624
Anymore, that is. In fact,
perhaps you should take it easy.

371
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,044
Ah, it helps me think better... Dad.

372
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:12,296
Mmm-hmm.

373
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:14,673
Yes, but what about the long-term
health consequences?

374
00:20:14,923 --> 00:20:18,719
Speaking of which, you might want
to lay off the saturated fats.

375
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:20,971
So...

376
00:20:21,972 --> 00:20:23,640
Alpha particles...

377
00:20:23,849 --> 00:20:25,392
Exciting stuff.

378
00:20:25,851 --> 00:20:28,937
Too bad detection is at least
a decade away.

379
00:20:29,146 --> 00:20:30,772
More like two decades.

380
00:20:30,981 --> 00:20:33,150
But I've worked up
a little something.

381
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:35,694
Science is all about
the future, right?

382
00:20:35,903 --> 00:20:38,071
I've developed
a prototype particle tracker.

383
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,742
Cutting edge. Probably gonna
mint me a million dollars.

384
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,035
Wow!

385
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:44,286
A whole million?

386
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:45,913
Be right back.

387
00:20:46,121 --> 00:20:49,333
I think I've got some chocolate
chip cookie dough in the fridge.

388
00:20:54,922 --> 00:20:57,049
I cannot believe that that is you.

389
00:20:57,257 --> 00:20:59,885
Seriously.
I had no idea you were ever cool.

390
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:02,679
I wasn't cool.
I was an arrogant little snot.

391
00:21:02,888 --> 00:21:05,098
- Was?
- What are you doing?

392
00:21:05,432 --> 00:21:07,601
Looking for my younger self's
particle tracker.

393
00:21:08,602 --> 00:21:09,728
Keep an eye on the door.

394
00:21:09,937 --> 00:21:12,189
And, when I get back,
stop flirting with me.

395
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:14,066
You're the one flirting with me.

396
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:15,400
Look, what's the big deal?

397
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:18,779
I mean, young you isn't married yet,
so technically it's not cheating.

398
00:21:20,781 --> 00:21:23,158
October 1975...

399
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:26,578
This is right when I meet
my future wife Clarissa.

400
00:21:26,787 --> 00:21:29,748
So obviously, we wouldn't want
my former self tempted

401
00:21:29,957 --> 00:21:32,459
by a sexy assassin from the future.

402
00:21:32,668 --> 00:21:34,461
Aww... You think I'm...

403
00:21:34,795 --> 00:21:37,255
Do not finish that sentence.

404
00:21:41,718 --> 00:21:42,970
Found it.

405
00:21:45,514 --> 00:21:47,683
Is there a trick
to opening the case?

406
00:21:55,857 --> 00:21:56,858
Aah...

407
00:21:57,025 --> 00:21:58,151
What are you doing?

408
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,545
Let's grab the dagger and let's go!

409
00:21:59,569 --> 00:22:03,156
Raymond, you don't break into
a candy store and steal one gumball.

410
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:05,033
You guys grab the goodies,

411
00:22:05,826 --> 00:22:07,202
I'll find the safe.

412
00:22:08,704 --> 00:22:10,163
What do you think you're doing?

413
00:22:10,372 --> 00:22:11,572
This is what we came here for.

414
00:22:11,707 --> 00:22:14,042
No, it's what you came here for.

415
00:22:15,544 --> 00:22:17,004
Take your hand off me.

416
00:22:17,212 --> 00:22:18,856
I'm not gonna let you
jeopardize another mission.

417
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,966
I'm done asking politely.

418
00:22:22,384 --> 00:22:23,802
This is my mission.

419
00:22:24,011 --> 00:22:26,763
And I'm gonna listen to a guy who's
spent half of his life in prison?

420
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:36,273
Great.
Now, we're both going to prison.

421
00:22:40,902 --> 00:22:42,029
Eureka.

422
00:22:43,155 --> 00:22:47,075
I remember building this.
It's like déjà vu all over again.

423
00:22:47,284 --> 00:22:48,910
Put that down.

424
00:22:49,536 --> 00:22:51,079
Excellent job watching the door.

425
00:22:51,705 --> 00:22:52,914
What're you doing?

426
00:22:53,123 --> 00:22:55,834
Oh, just... What is this?

427
00:22:56,043 --> 00:22:58,045
Something you shouldn't be
fooling around with.

428
00:22:58,587 --> 00:23:00,380
It's very interesting looking.

429
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:02,340
How about you cut the crap?

430
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:04,342
To which crap are you referring?

431
00:23:04,551 --> 00:23:08,472
I hold two PhD's
and I'm working on a third.

432
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:12,601
I'm a five-time winner
of the Carlin Award.

433
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:15,687
My point being, is I don't
believe either of those kids

434
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:18,106
you're hanging around
with can even spell "physics."

435
00:23:18,315 --> 00:23:21,485
You know, I'm beginning to like
the younger gray less and less.

436
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:25,363
Either you tell me what the hell is
going on or I'm calling campus police.

437
00:23:25,572 --> 00:23:27,115
I'm not supposed to tell you.

438
00:23:27,657 --> 00:23:30,202
It could cause, well, trouble.

439
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:35,582
We're here to interview you for a
profile in next month's <i>Wells Journal.</i>

440
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:39,044
The <i>Wells</i> only profiles
Nobel candidates.

441
00:23:39,252 --> 00:23:42,923
An exception is being made
in light of your obvious brilliance.

442
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:46,384
I know a photograph of this device
would make a spectacular cover.

443
00:23:46,593 --> 00:23:48,720
If we could just borrow it
for a few hours.

444
00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:52,808
Thanks.
But that's two years of my life.

445
00:23:53,683 --> 00:23:55,644
I'm not letting you
walk away with it.

446
00:23:55,852 --> 00:23:57,312
Stay back.

447
00:23:59,898 --> 00:24:01,608
That was taking too long.

448
00:24:02,526 --> 00:24:04,569
You just knocked me out.

449
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:07,656
That beautiful brain
struck unconscious!

450
00:24:07,864 --> 00:24:09,699
The only way to shut you up.

451
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:12,731
What're you doing?
We have to go.

452
00:24:12,869 --> 00:24:16,039
I have to make sure I wake up in time
to go to this Faculty Mixer tonight.

453
00:24:16,248 --> 00:24:18,416
One of the professors
is bringing his niece,

454
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:21,128
AKA my future wife.

455
00:24:21,336 --> 00:24:22,420
Let's go.

456
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,764
What the hell happened?

457
00:24:32,973 --> 00:24:34,099
It was this idiot's fault.

458
00:24:34,307 --> 00:24:35,701
I told you we shouldn't
have brought him.

459
00:24:35,725 --> 00:24:37,144
Agreed. But we got bigger problems.

460
00:24:37,352 --> 00:24:38,979
I need you to
find the fuse box and--

461
00:24:39,187 --> 00:24:41,106
Trigger a system default.

462
00:24:41,857 --> 00:24:43,316
This ain't over.

463
00:24:52,284 --> 00:24:53,553
How did you know how to do that?

464
00:24:53,577 --> 00:24:55,996
When I was a kid
my dad brought me along on jobs.

465
00:24:56,204 --> 00:24:58,790
I had little hands,
I could get into tiny spaces,

466
00:24:58,999 --> 00:25:00,542
do whatever he needed me to do...

467
00:25:01,459 --> 00:25:03,962
Like, rewiring a security system.

468
00:25:04,504 --> 00:25:06,607
In another life you could have
been an electrical engineer.

469
00:25:06,631 --> 00:25:08,800
I guess I dodged a bullet.

470
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:11,678
You think I want to be like you?

471
00:25:12,554 --> 00:25:14,890
You make being a tech billionaire
sound like a bad thing.

472
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:18,059
You spend all your time and money
inventing a super-suit,

473
00:25:18,268 --> 00:25:19,477
and what do you do with it?

474
00:25:19,686 --> 00:25:22,189
Fly around like some
incredible shrinking schmuck

475
00:25:22,397 --> 00:25:24,399
trying to save the world.

476
00:25:25,192 --> 00:25:26,377
And robbing banks for a living.

477
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:27,694
I suppose that's more important?

478
00:25:27,903 --> 00:25:30,071
It's sure as hell more satisfying.

479
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,841
Thinking like that
is what makes you a criminal.

480
00:25:31,865 --> 00:25:34,075
No, it makes me a survivor.

481
00:25:34,284 --> 00:25:37,329
And there's going to come a day
when you wish you were, too.

482
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:43,501
Here.

483
00:25:46,546 --> 00:25:48,048
You flip the solenoid,

484
00:25:48,256 --> 00:25:50,759
saves you the trouble of rewiring it.

485
00:25:51,927 --> 00:25:53,803
I take it back, Raymond.

486
00:25:54,012 --> 00:25:56,973
You're not completely
useless after all.

487
00:26:04,397 --> 00:26:06,024
I wanted to apologize.

488
00:26:06,233 --> 00:26:08,193
I'm not afraid of my past.

489
00:26:08,401 --> 00:26:11,780
I'm just unwilling to believe
that you are my future.

490
00:26:12,614 --> 00:26:15,909
And the more you keep repeating
that we're destined to be together,

491
00:26:16,117 --> 00:26:17,786
the more I want to prove you wrong.

492
00:26:18,245 --> 00:26:19,621
And maybe that makes me childish--

493
00:26:19,829 --> 00:26:22,082
No. It doesn't.

494
00:26:22,958 --> 00:26:24,542
Not at all.

495
00:26:25,585 --> 00:26:28,129
Look, 4,000 years is a long time.

496
00:26:29,047 --> 00:26:30,966
And maybe
I've been taking us for granted,

497
00:26:31,174 --> 00:26:32,568
expecting you
to fall in love with me

498
00:26:32,592 --> 00:26:35,470
because that's what you've done
in the last 206 lifetimes.

499
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,182
But, you're right,
it does not make us destiny.

500
00:26:40,392 --> 00:26:42,644
More like probability.

501
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:47,565
Look, Kendra.

502
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:50,318
You don't have to love me
in this lifetime.

503
00:26:50,986 --> 00:26:52,862
As many lifetimes as it takes.

504
00:26:53,905 --> 00:26:55,282
I know you're worth the wait.

505
00:26:58,201 --> 00:27:01,037
All right, well,
let's try this again.

506
00:27:04,165 --> 00:27:05,417
You know what to do.

507
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:11,256
Your name is Chay-Ara,

508
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:13,967
and you are a priestess
in the temple of Horus...

509
00:27:18,722 --> 00:27:21,808
You're giving me
a knife as a present?

510
00:27:22,517 --> 00:27:25,687
Your conceptions of romance
require some adjustment I think.

511
00:27:26,229 --> 00:27:27,230
It's sacred.

512
00:27:27,397 --> 00:27:30,650
I was told that only a high priestess
could read the inscription. It's--

513
00:27:30,859 --> 00:27:32,027
A poem.

514
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:36,906
<i>And though my soul departs the Earth
I count my days 'til my rebirth</i>

515
00:27:37,115 --> 00:27:41,494
<i>I will wait across eternity
For my love to come back to me</i>

516
00:27:55,091 --> 00:27:56,259
The knife...

517
00:27:56,468 --> 00:27:57,802
You gave it to me.

518
00:27:58,011 --> 00:28:00,138
And, the inscription, it was a poem.

519
00:28:00,347 --> 00:28:02,307
A love poem, which promises...

520
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:03,850
Promises what?

521
00:28:04,517 --> 00:28:07,020
That we'd be together forever.

522
00:28:11,358 --> 00:28:13,044
<i>Perhaps,
I really am genius.</i>

523
00:28:13,068 --> 00:28:16,154
<i>My younger self's tracker led us
straight to Savage's lab.</i>

524
00:28:16,363 --> 00:28:19,657
Reading's at 96.6%.
It's definitely down there.

525
00:28:19,866 --> 00:28:22,160
- Be right back.
- What? Wait, wait.

526
00:28:22,369 --> 00:28:25,163
Shouldn't we handle this?
I mean, you look pretty stoned.

527
00:28:25,705 --> 00:28:28,059
I could be unconscious and
I'd still be able to kick the ass

528
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:30,001
of a few rent-a-thugs from 1975.

529
00:28:40,762 --> 00:28:42,889
I do see
why I found her so attractive.

530
00:28:44,391 --> 00:28:46,559
- Looking for this.
- Yeah.

531
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,229
And you all have a lovely evening.

532
00:28:51,439 --> 00:28:52,524
Huh.

533
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:54,090
Looks like Rory found the fuse box.

534
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,568
<i>We got a slight problem.</i>

535
00:28:55,777 --> 00:28:59,364
The owner just came home.
You're not gonna believe who it is.

536
00:29:00,156 --> 00:29:02,075
We meet again.

537
00:29:02,534 --> 00:29:05,995
Oh, I'm grateful for another opportunity
to kill you.

538
00:29:12,001 --> 00:29:14,087
I've never saved the world before.

539
00:29:14,421 --> 00:29:15,630
Feels good.

540
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:18,383
We should've picked up some donuts
on the way back.

541
00:29:18,591 --> 00:29:20,760
My God. My ring.

542
00:29:21,594 --> 00:29:23,364
When you knocked me out,
I must not have woken up

543
00:29:23,388 --> 00:29:26,266
or did and decided
not to go to the Mixer.

544
00:29:26,683 --> 00:29:27,684
Clarissa...

545
00:29:27,851 --> 00:29:29,477
Holy crap.

546
00:29:29,686 --> 00:29:33,940
Now do you want to tell me
who you are and where you're from?

547
00:29:41,448 --> 00:29:43,450
Stop struggling.

548
00:29:43,658 --> 00:29:48,872
I've had 4,000 years of training in
every hold and pressure point known.

549
00:29:49,497 --> 00:29:52,000
But you already know that, don't you?

550
00:29:52,208 --> 00:29:53,626
That I am immortal.

551
00:29:53,918 --> 00:29:56,963
I'm going to kill you anyway.
That's a promise.

552
00:29:57,213 --> 00:29:59,757
Oh, what have I done to
deserve such enmity?

553
00:29:59,966 --> 00:30:04,471
No, let me rephrase that.
What have I done to you?

554
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:08,349
Perhaps you have targeted me
for something I've yet to do.

555
00:30:08,808 --> 00:30:11,644
You traveled here
from some point in the future.

556
00:30:11,853 --> 00:30:13,563
Catches on fast, this guy.

557
00:30:13,771 --> 00:30:15,857
Visitors from another time.

558
00:30:19,527 --> 00:30:21,630
You won't be so happy
when the rest of the team shows up.

559
00:30:21,654 --> 00:30:23,615
And knocks that
smug grin off your face.

560
00:30:23,907 --> 00:30:26,242
Oh... Why wait?

561
00:30:28,953 --> 00:30:33,708
A communications device
of some sort, I imagine?

562
00:30:34,709 --> 00:30:35,793
Please.

563
00:30:36,002 --> 00:30:37,253
Contact your friends.

564
00:30:37,462 --> 00:30:41,049
I'm looking forward to seeing
at least two of them again.

565
00:30:41,883 --> 00:30:44,302
Unbelievable.

566
00:30:44,511 --> 00:30:46,179
Is that a tachyon manifold?

567
00:30:46,387 --> 00:30:47,805
Hey. How did you find us, man?

568
00:30:48,014 --> 00:30:50,975
You think I couldn't build
something to track my own tracker?

569
00:30:51,184 --> 00:30:52,536
Do you have any idea
what you have done?

570
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,020
What I've done?

571
00:30:54,229 --> 00:30:56,147
You guys knocked me out.

572
00:30:56,356 --> 00:30:58,167
Which we wouldn't have had to do
in the first place

573
00:30:58,191 --> 00:30:59,859
if you weren't
such a monumental jerk!

574
00:31:00,068 --> 00:31:02,987
Okay, can I just... Yeah.

575
00:31:03,196 --> 00:31:04,989
You watch him, Sara.

576
00:31:06,241 --> 00:31:09,619
Yo, you need to calm down and
you need to stop yelling at yourself.

577
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:12,080
- His arrogant curiosity--
- Yeah.

578
00:31:12,288 --> 00:31:15,083
He's curious and too smart
for his own good.

579
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:16,668
But I'm sure you can relate.

580
00:31:17,043 --> 00:31:18,687
You're just pissed
you didn't see it coming sooner--

581
00:31:18,711 --> 00:31:20,004
That's not it.

582
00:31:20,547 --> 00:31:25,843
Although you are correct
in observing my ire is self-directed.

583
00:31:26,052 --> 00:31:27,178
It's a rude awakening

584
00:31:27,387 --> 00:31:30,223
when one realizes that
despite decades of what one thought

585
00:31:30,431 --> 00:31:33,685
was maturation and experience,

586
00:31:33,893 --> 00:31:36,813
you haven't really changed at all.

587
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:40,900
That same arrogance I derided
in my younger self

588
00:31:41,109 --> 00:31:43,403
was on full display
at the weapons bazaar.

589
00:31:43,736 --> 00:31:47,031
Over 60 years on this planet,
and I have learned nothing.

590
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:49,576
I think you're being
a little too hard on yourself.

591
00:31:49,784 --> 00:31:53,121
Which makes a nice change from
you always being hard on me, but...

592
00:31:53,705 --> 00:31:55,790
Yeah, you're arrogant.

593
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:59,711
But you're also smart and kind,
and selfless.

594
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:01,730
I mean, you wanna make the world
a better place

595
00:32:01,754 --> 00:32:04,757
and you're willing to risk everything
to make that happen.

596
00:32:04,966 --> 00:32:07,760
That... That is not a bad guy.

597
00:32:08,928 --> 00:32:10,471
And neither is this one.

598
00:32:12,432 --> 00:32:14,726
Meeting Clarissa was one of
the great moments of my life.

599
00:32:14,934 --> 00:32:17,937
And meeting you was another.

600
00:32:18,605 --> 00:32:22,525
You are a fine young man,
Mr. Jackson.

601
00:32:24,736 --> 00:32:25,862
Come on.

602
00:32:27,864 --> 00:32:30,617
Can someone, please,
tell me what's going on?

603
00:32:30,825 --> 00:32:32,065
You didn't say anything to him.

604
00:32:32,201 --> 00:32:34,078
I figured we screwed up
the '70s enough.

605
00:32:34,871 --> 00:32:37,016
What are you talking about?
Are you saying that you're from--

606
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,916
Don't say another word.
Don't even think it.

607
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:41,085
You are to get off this ship.
Post haste.

608
00:32:41,294 --> 00:32:43,504
Wonderful.
Another unauthorized passenger.

609
00:32:43,713 --> 00:32:45,340
That worked out
so splendidly last time.

610
00:32:45,548 --> 00:32:47,484
- Sorry, he was just leaving.
- I'll show you out.

611
00:32:47,508 --> 00:32:50,678
So have we met before?

612
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,640
In a manner of speaking.

613
00:32:54,974 --> 00:32:59,145
Have a wonderful life, Martin.
I mean that sincerely.

614
00:33:04,025 --> 00:33:05,652
I'm not even going to ask.

615
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:08,488
<i>Captain Hunter, we're getting
an incoming communiqué.</i>

616
00:33:08,905 --> 00:33:10,465
<i>Mister Snart on
Mister Rory's comm unit.</i>

617
00:33:10,657 --> 00:33:11,783
On speaker.

618
00:33:11,991 --> 00:33:13,159
<i>I'll make this short.</i>

619
00:33:13,368 --> 00:33:17,288
The owner of the mansion
we burgled is Vandal Savage.

620
00:33:17,872 --> 00:33:19,957
He's really interested
in meeting you guys.

621
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:22,919
Especially our feathered friends.

622
00:33:23,127 --> 00:33:25,129
- They have the dagger.
- And Savage has them.

623
00:33:25,338 --> 00:33:26,923
Doesn't matter.

624
00:33:27,131 --> 00:33:29,509
Just get me close enough
and I'll do what needs to be done.

625
00:33:29,717 --> 00:33:31,302
<i>I have their coordinates.</i>

626
00:33:31,803 --> 00:33:33,137
Let's do this.

627
00:33:34,514 --> 00:33:36,182
Your friends are cowards.

628
00:33:36,391 --> 00:33:37,725
They'll be here.

629
00:33:38,851 --> 00:33:39,977
They are taking too long.

630
00:33:40,186 --> 00:33:41,813
They need an incentive...

631
00:33:45,316 --> 00:33:46,401
Oh!

632
00:33:46,734 --> 00:33:48,194
The burning man.

633
00:33:48,403 --> 00:33:50,196
I don't just burn, pal.

634
00:33:57,203 --> 00:33:59,122
I blast things, too.

635
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:01,708
- Are you okay?
- I'm pissed.

636
00:34:02,417 --> 00:34:03,584
Stand back.

637
00:34:06,838 --> 00:34:08,381
It's all good. Savage is down.

638
00:34:08,589 --> 00:34:10,675
Savage is not defeated
by earthly means.

639
00:34:11,175 --> 00:34:14,095
Well, I hit him with a nuclear blast
so, you know, not that earthly.

640
00:34:17,765 --> 00:34:19,517
Go get that son of a bitch.

641
00:34:20,893 --> 00:34:22,770
Are you ready to end this?

642
00:34:22,979 --> 00:34:25,648
We've only been waiting 4,000 years.

643
00:34:29,444 --> 00:34:30,653
We got company.

644
00:34:30,862 --> 00:34:33,489
Friends of Savage.
You'll be needing this.

645
00:34:33,698 --> 00:34:35,867
Don't leave any pieces of it
behind this time.

646
00:34:50,757 --> 00:34:52,508
The Amon dagger.

647
00:34:52,717 --> 00:34:55,928
Of all the knives I've collected
across the centuries,

648
00:34:57,054 --> 00:34:58,723
that was my favorite.

649
00:35:17,575 --> 00:35:19,095
<i>And though my soul
departs the Earth...</i>

650
00:35:28,252 --> 00:35:30,171
Such a beautiful poem.

651
00:35:30,379 --> 00:35:31,756
I remember it well.

652
00:35:33,758 --> 00:35:38,679
As you can see, I can make
the dagger do its work without it.

653
00:35:40,848 --> 00:35:41,933
Carter!

654
00:35:46,687 --> 00:35:48,481
This was your lover's blade.

655
00:35:48,689 --> 00:35:50,775
It must be her hand that wields it.

656
00:35:57,865 --> 00:35:59,909
Something to consider
in your next life.

657
00:36:07,375 --> 00:36:08,584
Carter.

658
00:36:10,419 --> 00:36:12,880
It's okay. You're gonna be okay.

659
00:36:13,589 --> 00:36:14,757
I will wait...

660
00:36:16,092 --> 00:36:17,176
Through eternity...

661
00:36:17,426 --> 00:36:19,428
Please just save your strength.

662
00:36:20,346 --> 00:36:21,931
Come back to me.

663
00:36:23,766 --> 00:36:24,851
No.

664
00:37:02,722 --> 00:37:04,140
Murderer.

665
00:37:12,732 --> 00:37:15,651
I am not a murderer.
I am a force of nature.

666
00:37:15,902 --> 00:37:18,821
A servant of fate.
I enable destiny.

667
00:37:21,616 --> 00:37:23,993
I love you, Chay-Ara.

668
00:37:24,994 --> 00:37:26,329
I always will.

669
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:32,168
But we are both tortured

670
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,630
by this circle of death
we are imprisoned by.

671
00:37:43,346 --> 00:37:44,472
Carter...

672
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,681
He's lost.

673
00:37:45,848 --> 00:37:47,350
Get Kendra before Savage recovers.

674
00:37:47,516 --> 00:37:49,268
Come on.
We can still kill this bastard.

675
00:37:49,477 --> 00:37:50,978
Kendra is the only one who can.

676
00:37:51,187 --> 00:37:52,907
We gotta go.
Kendra needs medical attention.

677
00:37:56,692 --> 00:38:00,780
Gideon, get us underway as soon as
Firestorm and the Atom are onboard.

678
00:38:01,197 --> 00:38:02,531
Get her to the MedBay now.

679
00:38:05,785 --> 00:38:08,180
I assure you, Doctor Palmer, there's
nothing more you can do for her.

680
00:38:08,204 --> 00:38:10,039
- You can't let her die.
- I don't intend to.

681
00:38:10,206 --> 00:38:13,185
<i>Sharp force injury resulting in
rupture of several major blood vessels.</i>

682
00:38:13,209 --> 00:38:15,878
<i>Her pressure is currently
82 over 30 and stable.</i>

683
00:38:16,128 --> 00:38:17,546
<i>I will begin by
irrigating the wound</i>

684
00:38:17,797 --> 00:38:20,007
<i>and cauterizing it to prevent
any further hemorrhaging.</i>

685
00:38:20,216 --> 00:38:21,217
Thank you, Gideon.

686
00:38:21,384 --> 00:38:23,719
Carter! Carter!

687
00:38:23,886 --> 00:38:26,222
Gideon, if you wouldn't mind
administering a mild sedative.

688
00:38:26,472 --> 00:38:28,391
No! No!

689
00:38:29,225 --> 00:38:30,893
I didn't get to tell him...

690
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:33,229
I didn't get to tell him
it came back to me.

691
00:38:33,396 --> 00:38:35,982
I finally remembered how I felt
about him in our past lives

692
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:37,900
and I didn't get to tell him.

693
00:38:38,234 --> 00:38:40,319
I didn't get to tell him

694
00:38:40,528 --> 00:38:42,571
I felt the same way.

695
00:38:55,418 --> 00:38:57,753
- How is she?
- Stable, I think.

696
00:38:58,504 --> 00:39:02,258
Sara told me about what's happening
with your wife. I'm sorry.

697
00:39:02,425 --> 00:39:08,097
I'm so seduced by the prospects
of time travel, of adventure,

698
00:39:08,264 --> 00:39:10,891
I never stopped to consider
the consequences

699
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,560
of what we were undertaking.

700
00:39:12,768 --> 00:39:15,438
Gideon has managed to stabilize
Ms. Saunders' condition.

701
00:39:15,604 --> 00:39:18,774
But another time jump
could aggravate her injuries.

702
00:39:19,567 --> 00:39:22,278
- So we're stuck in '75?
- For the time being, yes.

703
00:39:23,404 --> 00:39:25,948
Given that, can I have
a moment of your time, Martin?

704
00:39:26,449 --> 00:39:28,617
There's something
that I would like to show you.

705
00:39:29,201 --> 00:39:30,453
Of course.

706
00:39:36,459 --> 00:39:39,795
Apparently, it's true that the guilty
return to the scene of the crime.

707
00:39:39,962 --> 00:39:42,131
Oh, don't be so maudlin.
Look at your hand.

708
00:39:43,799 --> 00:39:45,551
- How--
- I contacted your younger self

709
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,304
and encouraged him to attend
the Faculty Mixer.

710
00:39:48,554 --> 00:39:50,931
Turns out, one of the professors
brought along his niece.

711
00:39:53,601 --> 00:39:55,936
You risked the timeline for me?

712
00:39:56,145 --> 00:39:57,956
Hardly seemed fair for you
to sacrifice your wife

713
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:00,232
in order to save mine
from Savage's future.

714
00:40:00,441 --> 00:40:02,081
<i>The one thing that
time travel teaches you</i>

715
00:40:02,109 --> 00:40:05,821
is that time changes,
people don't.

716
00:40:06,489 --> 00:40:09,992
A painful realization
I've recently come to.

717
00:40:10,242 --> 00:40:12,082
I have traveled countless ages
into the future,

718
00:40:12,161 --> 00:40:14,580
we're still asking ourselves
the same question.

719
00:40:14,789 --> 00:40:16,332
Why are we here?

720
00:40:16,916 --> 00:40:19,585
I believe that we're here to learn,
Martin.

721
00:40:20,836 --> 00:40:22,338
Be glad that you still can.

722
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:25,341
Thank you, Mr. Hunter.

723
00:40:33,516 --> 00:40:35,851
- How is Kendra?
- The same.

724
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:37,686
So, what now?

725
00:40:38,187 --> 00:40:39,438
Now...

726
00:40:40,314 --> 00:40:41,315
Now, it's up to you.

727
00:40:41,482 --> 00:40:42,983
To do what, Rip?

728
00:40:43,192 --> 00:40:45,112
Last I checked,
every time we try to do anything,

729
00:40:45,152 --> 00:40:46,612
it all goes to crap.

730
00:40:46,821 --> 00:40:48,364
Once again,
I must disagree with you.

731
00:40:48,614 --> 00:40:50,699
Thanks to Miss Lance,
Dr. Palmer's future technology

732
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:52,070
is no longer in the hands of

733
00:40:52,118 --> 00:40:54,328
Vandal Savage's
black market weapons designers.

734
00:40:54,537 --> 00:40:57,289
But it didn't do anything
to change the fate of your world.

735
00:40:57,706 --> 00:40:58,791
No.

736
00:40:58,999 --> 00:41:02,044
Vandal Savage will still
rise to power in the year 2166.

737
00:41:02,378 --> 00:41:04,296
And your family will still die?

738
00:41:05,381 --> 00:41:09,552
So, what you're really asking is,
do we want to fish or cut bait?

739
00:41:09,718 --> 00:41:11,387
Return to 2016

740
00:41:11,554 --> 00:41:15,224
and live out the rest of our lives
as insignificant losers or...

741
00:41:15,391 --> 00:41:16,976
Make another play
at becoming legends.

742
00:41:17,184 --> 00:41:19,395
Figure out how to end Savage
and save the world.

743
00:41:19,562 --> 00:41:22,398
Preferably, without causing
any more nuclear explosions.

744
00:41:23,065 --> 00:41:24,400
Savage has my attention.

745
00:41:24,567 --> 00:41:26,735
Look, we didn't know
Carter from Adam.

746
00:41:26,902 --> 00:41:30,239
But if you take out one of my
crew, you're gonna pay the price.

747
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:35,077
Well, surely,
Captain Hunter has a sound plan.

748
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:38,497
- What about you?
- You're asking me?

749
00:41:38,706 --> 00:41:41,542
I didn't give you much of a choice
the first time, did I?

750
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:43,586
Well, I say we kick Savage's ass.

751
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:45,421
For Carter.

752
00:41:45,588 --> 00:41:46,672
For Carter.

753
00:41:46,881 --> 00:41:47,923
For Carter.

754
00:41:49,049 --> 00:41:52,344
So, Captain,
where are we going next?

755
00:42:28,464 --> 00:42:29,506
English SDH
