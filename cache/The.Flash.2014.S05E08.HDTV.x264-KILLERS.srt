1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,484
Previously on "The Flash"...

2
00:00:01,487 --> 00:00:03,585
That dagger he had negated our powers.

3
00:00:03,588 --> 00:00:04,921
I just lost my speed.

4
00:00:04,924 --> 00:00:07,585
I'm gonna make this right, Gracie.

5
00:00:07,588 --> 00:00:12,312
Every meta will die.

6
00:00:12,315 --> 00:00:14,693
So we're dealing with a
meta-human Jack the Ripper.

7
00:00:14,695 --> 00:00:17,929
I give you Orlin Dwyer, also known as...

8
00:00:17,931 --> 00:00:19,197
Cicada.

9
00:00:30,644 --> 00:00:32,310
How many you shoot?

10
00:00:32,312 --> 00:00:33,773
Shot like a hundred.

11
00:00:33,776 --> 00:00:35,109
Any of them good?

12
00:00:35,112 --> 00:00:36,144
Bof.

13
00:00:39,062 --> 00:00:41,520
Guess we'll just have to keep
shooting till we get it right.

14
00:00:41,522 --> 00:00:43,288
I guess so.

15
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,090
Orlin Dwyer.

16
00:00:45,092 --> 00:00:47,225
Near as we can tell, he
grew up in the Midwest.

17
00:00:47,227 --> 00:00:49,387
In and out of juvie, pretty
much fell off the map,

18
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,501
and then popped up in
Central City a few years ago.

19
00:00:51,504 --> 00:00:53,036
Part-time employee of Szrek Chemicals

20
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,099
for the last two years.

21
00:00:54,101 --> 00:00:55,514
Foreman says he keeps to himself,

22
00:00:55,517 --> 00:00:57,418
pretty much a loner, gave a fake address.

23
00:00:57,421 --> 00:00:59,137
Did take custody of his niece.

24
00:00:59,139 --> 00:01:00,939
Grace Gibbons.

25
00:01:00,941 --> 00:01:03,020
After her parents were
unfortunately murdered

26
00:01:03,023 --> 00:01:04,332
by a meta-human, now...

27
00:01:04,335 --> 00:01:06,211
So now we know why Dwyer hates metas.

28
00:01:06,213 --> 00:01:08,246
Once he got his powers,
he started targeting them.

29
00:01:08,248 --> 00:01:10,005
Powers he got the night
of the Enlightenment,

30
00:01:10,007 --> 00:01:11,550
as we all know, and he was struck

31
00:01:11,552 --> 00:01:13,856
by a shard from the S.T.A.R.
Lab satellite explosion.

32
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:15,051
Which was also the same night

33
00:01:15,054 --> 00:01:16,621
that Grace went into a coma.

34
00:01:16,623 --> 00:01:20,171
Where Dwyer visits her
every day, every night,

35
00:01:20,174 --> 00:01:22,108
for the last three weeks.

36
00:01:22,111 --> 00:01:24,262
So he's there now.

37
00:01:24,264 --> 00:01:25,564
- Yeah.
- Oui.

38
00:01:27,698 --> 00:01:29,484
Then let's go get him.

39
00:01:29,487 --> 00:01:32,471
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

40
00:01:32,473 --> 00:01:34,005
"Let's go get him."

41
00:01:34,007 --> 00:01:35,794
How are you going to do
that? Look, as always,

42
00:01:35,796 --> 00:01:37,172
I respect your spirit, Barry Allen,

43
00:01:37,174 --> 00:01:40,709
but as long as Cicada has his
dagger to dampen your powers,

44
00:01:40,712 --> 00:01:42,381
there's no stopping him.

45
00:01:42,384 --> 00:01:43,717
So let's destroy his dagger.

46
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,986
How are we gonna do that

47
00:01:44,989 --> 00:01:46,421
unless we have some kind of

48
00:01:46,424 --> 00:01:48,804
power-dampening dagger power dampener

49
00:01:48,807 --> 00:01:50,007
hidden away in storage?

50
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,398
We don't, but if we did

51
00:01:51,401 --> 00:01:53,851
we'd come up with a much
better way of saying that.

52
00:01:53,854 --> 00:01:55,987
Sure, I mean, just,
like, dagger-dampener...

53
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,990
Wait, yeah, that's
actually... That's decent,

54
00:01:57,993 --> 00:01:59,730
'cause, you know, you're running into...

55
00:01:59,733 --> 00:02:02,934
Just abbreviate. P-D-P-D.

56
00:02:05,873 --> 00:02:08,073
Guys.

57
00:02:08,075 --> 00:02:09,774
What if we could make one?

58
00:02:11,277 --> 00:02:13,177
Make one what?

59
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:16,906
What if we can make a weapon
more powerful than his weapon?

60
00:02:16,909 --> 00:02:18,593
Cicada can control his dagger,

61
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:20,839
so what we would need would
be something more powerful

62
00:02:20,842 --> 00:02:22,108
than his connection to it.

63
00:02:22,111 --> 00:02:23,781
Wait, like... Like some kind of

64
00:02:23,784 --> 00:02:25,625
- super-charged magnet?
- Exactly.

65
00:02:25,628 --> 00:02:26,728
I don't know if we have anything

66
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:27,726
strong enough for that.

67
00:02:27,729 --> 00:02:30,494
We made Sally out of a
micro-composite alloy.

68
00:02:30,497 --> 00:02:32,164
As far as satellite's go, she's...

69
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:33,570
She was heavy-duty.

70
00:02:33,573 --> 00:02:35,198
And even if we could get
our hands on the dagger,

71
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,369
we'd still have to figure out
how to take the dark matter out

72
00:02:37,371 --> 00:02:39,304
- to negate it's powers.
- Well, exactly right.

73
00:02:39,307 --> 00:02:41,094
I mean, what you're suggesting
is we find an alloy...

74
00:02:41,096 --> 00:02:43,507
No, no, indestructible alloy

75
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:45,877
that has super magnetic properties,

76
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,081
but also has the ability
to negate dark matter.

77
00:02:49,084 --> 00:02:52,552
I mean, where are we
going to find such a thing?

78
00:02:52,555 --> 00:02:54,288
The past.

79
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:56,058
The past?

80
00:02:56,061 --> 00:02:58,761
You've already come across
everything that we need, right?

81
00:02:58,764 --> 00:03:01,231
A strong alloy with magnetic properties.

82
00:03:01,234 --> 00:03:02,967
Savitar's suit.

83
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:04,662
Something to remove dark matter.

84
00:03:04,665 --> 00:03:05,914
The Speed Force transmitter

85
00:03:05,917 --> 00:03:07,778
that Zoom used to steal Barry's speed.

86
00:03:07,781 --> 00:03:09,201
Yeah, but that was his Speed Force.

87
00:03:09,203 --> 00:03:10,485
Yeah, but those are exotic particles,

88
00:03:10,487 --> 00:03:12,468
which are basically the
same thing as dark energy,

89
00:03:12,471 --> 00:03:15,005
so we would just need some
of that to recalibrate it.

90
00:03:15,008 --> 00:03:16,708
Can... can you do that?

91
00:03:16,711 --> 00:03:19,011
I mean, you'd have to
infuse the transmitter

92
00:03:19,014 --> 00:03:20,711
with the same kind of dark matter.

93
00:03:20,714 --> 00:03:23,109
Like the DeVoe kind?

94
00:03:23,112 --> 00:03:25,245
More like the Particle Accelerator kind.

95
00:03:25,248 --> 00:03:28,254
I'm sorry, we... we need to
blow up S.T.A.R. Labs again?

96
00:03:28,257 --> 00:03:29,453
No, no, not again.

97
00:03:29,456 --> 00:03:32,190
We just need to go back to the
first time that it happened,

98
00:03:32,193 --> 00:03:34,160
This is gonna mess with
the timeline too much.

99
00:03:34,163 --> 00:03:37,265
No, it's not. Savitar's
suit, the transmitter,

100
00:03:37,268 --> 00:03:39,390
these are all just
discarded objects in time,

101
00:03:39,393 --> 00:03:42,140
so if we steal them, it
won't affect anything at all.

102
00:03:42,143 --> 00:03:45,278
Even if all of that
worked, we can't just waltz

103
00:03:45,281 --> 00:03:46,268
into the hospital with

104
00:03:46,271 --> 00:03:48,439
our soon-to-be-named dampening device.

105
00:03:48,442 --> 00:03:51,250
Dwyer smells us coming, he's gone.

106
00:03:51,253 --> 00:03:53,754
Then we do a time hack.

107
00:03:53,757 --> 00:03:55,746
A time hack?

108
00:03:55,749 --> 00:03:57,816
- Is when you...
- Plant something in the past

109
00:03:57,818 --> 00:04:00,318
so it's available in the future.

110
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,721
You go back, you take the device,

111
00:04:02,723 --> 00:04:04,687
and you hide it near the hospital.

112
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:07,424
Somewhere it won't be
found for five years.

113
00:04:07,427 --> 00:04:09,160
He won't even know it's there.

114
00:04:09,162 --> 00:04:12,601
So you and your father
go back to the past

115
00:04:12,604 --> 00:04:15,138
to defeat Cicada in the future.

116
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:21,046
Quite an off-the-cuff
plan you've come up with.

117
00:04:21,049 --> 00:04:22,187
We can do this.

118
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,992
No.

119
00:04:26,289 --> 00:04:28,756
I can do it.

120
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:33,317
Can you guys figure out the
best dates to go back to?

121
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,875
We're on it.

122
00:04:40,595 --> 00:04:42,294
- You're not coming with me.
- Why?

123
00:04:42,297 --> 00:04:45,031
Every time I try something
like this I nearly get killed.

124
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:46,938
Well, yeah, all the more
reason for me to come with you,

125
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,962
so that I can watch your
back so you don't get hurt.

126
00:04:48,964 --> 00:04:50,539
It's too risky with the timeline.

127
00:04:50,542 --> 00:04:52,642
All right, look, time
travel, it's complicated.

128
00:04:52,645 --> 00:04:54,238
I know, I've already done it.

129
00:04:54,241 --> 00:04:56,441
And look what happened.

130
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,113
Look.

131
00:05:02,115 --> 00:05:04,716
I just want to fix what I screwed up.

132
00:05:04,718 --> 00:05:07,385
Okay, what I did.

133
00:05:07,387 --> 00:05:10,422
Please, let me come with you.

134
00:05:10,431 --> 00:05:11,830
Not today.

135
00:05:20,567 --> 00:05:22,500
You think she should come with me?

136
00:05:22,502 --> 00:05:24,302
Yeah, Barry, I do.

137
00:05:24,304 --> 00:05:25,578
Iris, if I do this,

138
00:05:25,581 --> 00:05:27,405
I'm going back to some crazy times.

139
00:05:27,407 --> 00:05:29,851
Savitar, Zoom, Thawne, Speedsters...

140
00:05:29,854 --> 00:05:32,776
Who you've all outsmarted and defeated.

141
00:05:32,779 --> 00:05:36,848
Look, this was her idea,
Barry. Her solution.

142
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:39,078
And it's a good one.

143
00:05:39,081 --> 00:05:40,848
So, unless you have a better reason

144
00:05:40,851 --> 00:05:45,153
why she should stay back...

145
00:05:45,156 --> 00:05:47,092
let her do this.

146
00:05:50,597 --> 00:05:53,498
Okay, these are the best of times.

147
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,533
Incidentally, they were
also the worst of times,

148
00:05:55,535 --> 00:05:58,103
but in terms of going back, this is it.

149
00:05:58,105 --> 00:06:00,531
Savitar. When we defeated him,

150
00:06:00,534 --> 00:06:02,832
Barry phased into his suit, destroyed it,

151
00:06:02,835 --> 00:06:05,770
sending pieces of it
flying far enough away

152
00:06:05,773 --> 00:06:08,382
that our past selves wouldn't notice

153
00:06:08,385 --> 00:06:10,051
if Barry took one or two pieces of it.

154
00:06:10,054 --> 00:06:11,549
- What do you think?
- Absolutely,

155
00:06:11,551 --> 00:06:13,285
Barry just has to get
back into the Speed Force

156
00:06:13,287 --> 00:06:14,624
before the timeline catches up

157
00:06:14,627 --> 00:06:16,420
and those pieces get
erased from existence.

158
00:06:16,423 --> 00:06:17,789
I'm fairly optimistic.

159
00:06:17,792 --> 00:06:20,553
Okay, what about the Speed
Force transmitter thingy?

160
00:06:20,556 --> 00:06:23,257
The night that Zoom injected
the speed force into himself,

161
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,687
he left the Speed Force transmitter

162
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:25,867
in the viewing room.

163
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,503
Yes, that's brilliant, all he has to do

164
00:06:27,506 --> 00:06:30,040
is make sure no one's in
there when he takes it.

165
00:06:30,043 --> 00:06:32,803
What about when the Particle
Accelerator exploded?

166
00:06:32,806 --> 00:06:34,572
Well, right before
everything went sideways,

167
00:06:34,574 --> 00:06:37,409
Wells was in the cortex, and we...

168
00:06:39,586 --> 00:06:41,687
We were in the pipeline intake.

169
00:06:44,518 --> 00:06:46,484
Ronnie!

170
00:06:48,388 --> 00:06:51,189
That's the best time for Barry
to go into the time vault.

171
00:06:51,191 --> 00:06:53,348
He can put a piece of
Savitar's suit in the plinth,

172
00:06:53,351 --> 00:06:55,694
and when the Particle
Accelerator explodes

173
00:06:55,696 --> 00:06:58,530
it should infuse it with dark matter.

174
00:06:58,532 --> 00:07:01,023
Right.

175
00:07:01,026 --> 00:07:03,127
So once that's done,

176
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:05,736
we'll have all the pieces
we need to make the device.

177
00:07:05,739 --> 00:07:09,274
We plant it in the hospital,
the rest is history.

178
00:07:09,276 --> 00:07:12,110
Great, let's go show Barry
and see what he thinks.

179
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,487
I'll be right behind you.

180
00:07:16,802 --> 00:07:19,102
Where did I leave...

181
00:07:21,688 --> 00:07:23,355
Aha.

182
00:07:24,858 --> 00:07:26,191
What is this?

183
00:07:26,193 --> 00:07:27,559
What is that? Nora's journal?

184
00:07:27,561 --> 00:07:28,827
What, are you stealing now?

185
00:07:28,829 --> 00:07:31,242
No... Yes, but for good reason.

186
00:07:31,245 --> 00:07:32,310
Look at this code.

187
00:07:32,313 --> 00:07:34,833
Have you seen this code before?

188
00:07:34,835 --> 00:07:36,868
- Yeah.
- Yeah, when?

189
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,537
Right after Barry came out
of the Speed Force a year ago.

190
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:41,072
And did you decipher the code?

191
00:07:41,074 --> 00:07:43,375
Well, my computer did just one sentence.

192
00:07:43,378 --> 00:07:45,045
Ah, well...

193
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:48,178
Hey, listen here, space invader.

194
00:07:48,181 --> 00:07:51,850
Why don't you try
returning the thing to her,

195
00:07:51,852 --> 00:07:53,251
and then asking her?

196
00:07:53,253 --> 00:07:55,286
Of course. Of course.

197
00:07:55,288 --> 00:07:56,820
- Right.
- Makes sense.

198
00:07:56,823 --> 00:07:58,853
Just return the...

199
00:08:05,332 --> 00:08:07,932
All right,

200
00:08:07,934 --> 00:08:09,429
let's do it.

201
00:08:09,432 --> 00:08:11,101
Cool.

202
00:08:11,104 --> 00:08:13,113
You're not gonna want to forget this.

203
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:18,143
Had to make some
adjustments to the suit,

204
00:08:18,145 --> 00:08:19,811
but I finally figured it out.

205
00:08:19,813 --> 00:08:21,679
For emergencies only.

206
00:08:21,681 --> 00:08:23,587
You don't want to get caught
running around the past

207
00:08:23,589 --> 00:08:25,950
- in your future Flash suit.
- Right.

208
00:08:25,952 --> 00:08:27,786
You might get ideas.

209
00:08:27,788 --> 00:08:30,455
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

210
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,100
Come on.

211
00:08:53,013 --> 00:08:54,779
Okay, look, follow my lead.

212
00:08:54,781 --> 00:08:57,182
Don't go off book.

213
00:08:57,184 --> 00:09:00,952
If anything goes wrong,
do exactly as I say.

214
00:09:00,954 --> 00:09:03,688
Do things usually go wrong?

215
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,089
What?

216
00:09:18,092 --> 00:09:19,971
When am I gonna get
the chance to do that?

217
00:09:19,973 --> 00:09:21,870
Hey, game face.

218
00:09:21,873 --> 00:09:23,784
All right, so what do
we do while they're gone?

219
00:09:23,787 --> 00:09:25,086
Do we stake out the hospital?

220
00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:26,356
Get everything ready here or what?

221
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:27,858
Nothing. They're gonna return

222
00:09:27,861 --> 00:09:29,713
to the exact same moment that they left.

223
00:09:29,716 --> 00:09:31,472
Wait, so, they're gonna go,

224
00:09:31,475 --> 00:09:33,409
but to us it'll be like they never left?

225
00:09:33,412 --> 00:09:35,420
Yeah, time travel's weird, isn't it?

226
00:09:35,422 --> 00:09:36,964
Here they go.

227
00:09:36,967 --> 00:09:38,441
Good luck.

228
00:09:56,234 --> 00:09:58,434
Get ready.

229
00:09:58,437 --> 00:09:59,730
Now!

230
00:10:07,404 --> 00:10:09,771
Are you sure we're in the right place?

231
00:10:19,428 --> 00:10:21,367
Is that Savitar?

232
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,867
That's him.

233
00:10:38,145 --> 00:10:39,847
Come on.

234
00:10:51,956 --> 00:10:54,244
I only have a few minutes left.

235
00:10:54,246 --> 00:10:56,146
If I am going to die,

236
00:10:56,148 --> 00:10:59,916
then everything you love
is going to die too.

237
00:10:59,918 --> 00:11:02,152
Holy shrap.

238
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:15,799
How's it feel to get so
close to your ascension,

239
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:18,089
and end up on the ground?

240
00:11:18,092 --> 00:11:21,136
Now I see.

241
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:23,807
- It's written.
- Nothing's written.

242
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:31,081
What was that?

243
00:11:31,084 --> 00:11:32,556
Time Wraith. They protect the timeline.

244
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:34,017
I've got to get it out of here.

245
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:36,052
Nora, you're gonna have
to get the shard, okay?

246
00:11:36,054 --> 00:11:38,394
Meet me in the forest
where we first arrived.

247
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,279
Mom?

248
00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:35,129
- Did you get it?
- Yeah, I got it.

249
00:12:35,132 --> 00:12:37,446
Nice job getting that into
the Speed Force on time.

250
00:12:37,449 --> 00:12:40,216
Nothing to it.

251
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:43,186
Dad, about Savitar...

252
00:12:43,188 --> 00:12:44,820
This is right. 2016.

253
00:12:44,823 --> 00:12:45,894
How do you know?

254
00:12:45,897 --> 00:12:47,269
Because that was Zoom with Wally.

255
00:12:47,272 --> 00:12:49,925
I'm about to lose my speed. Come on.

256
00:12:58,091 --> 00:13:00,926
- Barry, are you okay?
- I'm okay.

257
00:13:00,929 --> 00:13:02,027
I'm okay.

258
00:13:03,775 --> 00:13:05,198
Thank you, Flash.

259
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,701
Jay, stop!

260
00:13:06,704 --> 00:13:09,094
If you have any humanity left,

261
00:13:09,097 --> 00:13:11,508
then please let him go.

262
00:13:21,331 --> 00:13:22,995
Caitlin!

263
00:13:29,467 --> 00:13:32,101
We gotta get Caitlin back.

264
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:34,404
Stay here. Don't move.

265
00:13:34,406 --> 00:13:35,964
Okay? Stay.

266
00:13:44,049 --> 00:13:45,761
No.

267
00:13:45,764 --> 00:13:47,083
What?

268
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:50,486
Barry...

269
00:13:55,427 --> 00:13:58,428
You can't let your losses stop you.

270
00:14:00,912 --> 00:14:02,863
You're the one who taught me that.

271
00:14:04,478 --> 00:14:05,800
You have to keep moving.

272
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,636
You have to... push through.

273
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,413
You have to find a
way. You have to fight.

274
00:14:14,779 --> 00:14:19,215
So that nothing, ever,
will hold you back, Barry.

275
00:14:19,217 --> 00:14:22,485
Do what you can, and I
know you lost your speed,

276
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:25,421
but everyone's here to help.

277
00:14:25,423 --> 00:14:30,760
My dad, Cisco, Harry...

278
00:14:30,762 --> 00:14:32,409
me.

279
00:14:43,144 --> 00:14:45,073
Come on. Come on.

280
00:15:03,228 --> 00:15:04,800
Well, you change quickly.

281
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:06,421
What?

282
00:15:06,424 --> 00:15:08,824
- Out of your suit.
- Yeah, no, I...

283
00:15:08,827 --> 00:15:12,847
Yeah, it was, just too weird
being in it without my speed.

284
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,484
Well, that's your own
damn fault, isn't it?

285
00:15:14,486 --> 00:15:16,319
- I guess so.
- I know so.

286
00:15:18,942 --> 00:15:20,159
What are you looking for?

287
00:15:20,162 --> 00:15:23,183
I'm looking for anything
to help me find my daughter.

288
00:15:23,186 --> 00:15:24,534
All right, just...

289
00:15:30,036 --> 00:15:31,652
I don't have my daughter.

290
00:15:31,655 --> 00:15:34,128
You don't have your
speed. Zoom has Caitlin,

291
00:15:34,131 --> 00:15:35,739
and this whole thing...
this whole thing...

292
00:15:35,741 --> 00:15:36,807
Is going to hell in a hand basket...

293
00:15:36,809 --> 00:15:38,576
No, no, wait, wait, wait!

294
00:15:40,392 --> 00:15:41,691
Her frequency.

295
00:15:41,694 --> 00:15:43,360
- What?
- Jesse's frequency.

296
00:15:43,363 --> 00:15:46,401
People from Earth-2 vibrate
at a different frequency.

297
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:49,272
Maybe you could track her that way.

298
00:15:54,104 --> 00:15:57,073
Figure out how to find Snow.

299
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,917
- Did you get it?
- I got it.

300
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,698
Let's build this thing.

301
00:16:07,209 --> 00:16:11,863
You're not going anywhere, Flash.

302
00:16:16,498 --> 00:16:18,521
You got what you want, Solomon.

303
00:16:21,626 --> 00:16:23,893
And who is this?

304
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:27,730
Another Speedster.

305
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:54,023
No, no, no!

306
00:16:55,494 --> 00:16:56,912
Damn it!

307
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:58,648
I knew we shouldn't have done this.

308
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:00,190
Now we have no way to stop Cicada.

309
00:17:00,193 --> 00:17:01,358
I mean, I don't even know when we are.

310
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,850
Dad, Dad, we can fix this.

311
00:17:02,853 --> 00:17:04,209
I can't fix this, Nora.

312
00:17:04,212 --> 00:17:06,445
Cisco can't even fix
this. This is Wells' tech.

313
00:17:06,448 --> 00:17:07,698
Well, let's go back to Wells.

314
00:17:07,701 --> 00:17:09,020
We can't. Harry's...

315
00:17:09,023 --> 00:17:10,560
Harry's mind isn't what it used to be.

316
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:11,739
No, I don't mean that Wells.

317
00:17:11,742 --> 00:17:13,655
I mean the one that built
the Particle Accelerator.

318
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:15,523
That's not Wells. That is Eobard Thawne,

319
00:17:15,526 --> 00:17:16,825
the Reverse-Flash.

320
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:18,461
I know, it's just, he's really smart.

321
00:17:18,464 --> 00:17:20,327
So I thought maybe we could
convince him to help us.

322
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:21,928
No, okay, look, no.

323
00:17:21,931 --> 00:17:25,600
The only person Thawne
ever helps is himself.

324
00:17:25,603 --> 00:17:27,184
Okay.

325
00:17:27,187 --> 00:17:30,555
I'm sorry, I just thought that maybe...

326
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:31,924
What?

327
00:17:34,032 --> 00:17:35,794
I know when we are.

328
00:17:39,945 --> 00:17:41,837
- Oh...
- Leave him. Leave him.

329
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,706
- The less we mess...
- Mess with the timeline.

330
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,208
I know.

331
00:17:46,478 --> 00:17:47,877
I know what this is.

332
00:17:47,879 --> 00:17:51,414
Three years ago I
traveled back to this day

333
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:54,183
to get Thawne's help.

334
00:17:54,185 --> 00:17:56,819
So you have done it before.

335
00:18:17,409 --> 00:18:20,176
Well...

336
00:18:20,178 --> 00:18:23,279
things just got a lot more
complicated, didn't they?

337
00:18:29,955 --> 00:18:31,621
Barry Allen.

338
00:18:34,392 --> 00:18:37,393
But which Barry Allen?

339
00:18:37,395 --> 00:18:39,762
Clearly you're...

340
00:18:39,764 --> 00:18:42,052
- from a lot later than this one.
- Way later.

341
00:18:42,055 --> 00:18:43,454
Way later.

342
00:18:46,438 --> 00:18:48,638
Who's your friend?

343
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,541
Let me guess.

344
00:18:51,543 --> 00:18:53,076
Jesse Chambers. No.

345
00:18:53,078 --> 00:18:54,645
Maybe Lawrence. Wait.

346
00:18:54,648 --> 00:18:57,645
- Danica Williams.
- It doesn't matter who she is.

347
00:19:01,586 --> 00:19:03,353
She's your daughter.

348
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:08,291
You've brought me your daughter.

349
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:14,046
It's, um...

350
00:19:14,049 --> 00:19:17,917
Dawn, if I'm not mistaken.

351
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,202
Nora.

352
00:19:21,139 --> 00:19:22,372
Nora.

353
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,101
Oh, that's nice.

354
00:19:28,104 --> 00:19:30,345
At least you still have one.

355
00:19:30,348 --> 00:19:33,716
What, Nora, time travel's so weird.

356
00:19:33,718 --> 00:19:36,452
What do you want?

357
00:19:36,454 --> 00:19:38,421
I need you to fix this for me.

358
00:19:41,903 --> 00:19:43,159
No...

359
00:19:46,631 --> 00:19:48,564
No, if you're here...

360
00:19:50,702 --> 00:19:52,653
And he's here...

361
00:19:52,663 --> 00:19:54,262
- that means...
- You don't get home.

362
00:19:54,265 --> 00:19:55,498
I get home!

363
00:19:55,501 --> 00:19:57,935
I get home. I go home!

364
00:19:57,938 --> 00:20:01,706
- I get everything...
- You don't go home, Thawne.

365
00:20:03,815 --> 00:20:06,649
Unless you help me.

366
00:20:26,618 --> 00:20:28,503
What do you want?

367
00:20:28,506 --> 00:20:31,107
Like I said, you're
gonna fix this for me.

368
00:20:31,109 --> 00:20:33,042
- To do what?
- Drain dark matter.

369
00:20:33,044 --> 00:20:34,661
- Who's dark matter?
- None of your business.

370
00:20:34,663 --> 00:20:35,845
- It is my business.
- No, it's not.

371
00:20:35,847 --> 00:20:37,013
There's no chance that I help you...

372
00:20:37,015 --> 00:20:39,015
- It's none of your business...
- Cicada's!

373
00:20:41,686 --> 00:20:43,286
Cicada's.

374
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:49,066
The one who got away.

375
00:20:51,996 --> 00:20:54,030
You want to destroy
Cicada's dagger, don't you?

376
00:20:54,032 --> 00:20:55,264
We want to save lives.

377
00:20:57,002 --> 00:20:59,222
You want to save lives.

378
00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:00,858
I bet you do. I bet you do.

379
00:21:00,861 --> 00:21:02,358
Especially your own, right, Barry Allen?

380
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,107
Look, that me, he's gonna wake up soon.

381
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,484
He sees me standing here,

382
00:21:06,487 --> 00:21:08,410
your whole timeline is
gonna be blown to hell.

383
00:21:08,413 --> 00:21:10,413
You're never gonna get
home. You know that's true!

384
00:21:10,415 --> 00:21:12,949
I know! I know!

385
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:21,452
Where are my manners?

386
00:21:21,455 --> 00:21:23,694
Can I get you a cup of water?

387
00:21:28,399 --> 00:21:30,733
So who made this?

388
00:21:30,735 --> 00:21:32,268
Someone smarter than you.

389
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:34,288
I doubt that.

390
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:37,739
You know, Allen, for your plan to work,

391
00:21:37,742 --> 00:21:39,898
you're gonna actually gonna
have to have his dagger

392
00:21:39,901 --> 00:21:41,435
- in your possession...
- We've got that covered.

393
00:21:41,437 --> 00:21:43,112
You got that covered. How's that?

394
00:21:43,114 --> 00:21:44,577
With this.

395
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:50,657
Is that...

396
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:53,428
It's a piece of Savitar's suit, yeah.

397
00:21:53,431 --> 00:21:54,697
Hmm.

398
00:21:56,928 --> 00:22:01,297
You know what's funny
about your dad, Nora,

399
00:22:01,299 --> 00:22:03,800
is he hates me.

400
00:22:03,802 --> 00:22:05,868
Hates me with a passion,

401
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:10,106
and yet a version of him, this Savitar,

402
00:22:10,108 --> 00:22:12,074
is a much bigger jerk than I ever was.

403
00:22:12,076 --> 00:22:13,991
Did you see the face? Did you...

404
00:22:13,994 --> 00:22:16,344
did you see the, like, pizza face.

405
00:22:16,347 --> 00:22:19,148
- Can you hurry up?
- Yeah, I'll hurry up.

406
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:20,783
I gotta tell you, Allen,

407
00:22:20,785 --> 00:22:23,753
using Savitar's suit,

408
00:22:23,755 --> 00:22:25,087
it's a smart idea.

409
00:22:25,089 --> 00:22:26,722
It was hers.

410
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:33,596
Clever girl.

411
00:22:35,233 --> 00:22:36,532
Oops.

412
00:22:37,902 --> 00:22:39,802
Gotta go.

413
00:22:41,539 --> 00:22:44,574
I still look forward to
seeing how this all pans out.

414
00:22:44,576 --> 00:22:45,608
Nora.

415
00:22:50,006 --> 00:22:51,673
Hey, Dad...

416
00:22:51,683 --> 00:22:54,077
It's time to go back to
the night it all began.

417
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,284
Come on.

418
00:23:13,371 --> 00:23:16,187
Tonight, the future begins.

419
00:23:16,189 --> 00:23:18,256
The work my team and I will do here

420
00:23:18,258 --> 00:23:20,524
will change our
understanding of physics,

421
00:23:20,526 --> 00:23:22,927
will bring about advancements in power,

422
00:23:22,929 --> 00:23:24,829
advancements in medicine,

423
00:23:24,831 --> 00:23:28,633
and trust me, that future will
be here faster than you think.

424
00:23:37,209 --> 00:23:39,476
Uh, why are we going this way?

425
00:23:39,479 --> 00:23:41,345
Why don't we just speed
into the time vault?

426
00:23:41,347 --> 00:23:43,948
Because it's a big moment, Nora.

427
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:46,984
Thawne's been planning
this night for 14 years.

428
00:23:46,986 --> 00:23:49,220
If we use our speed, he'll feel it.

429
00:23:49,222 --> 00:23:51,355
Feel a disturbance in the Speed Force.

430
00:23:51,357 --> 00:23:53,457
I wouldn't do that.

431
00:24:02,034 --> 00:24:04,668
Dr. Wells, the accelerator is primed

432
00:24:04,671 --> 00:24:06,203
and ready for particle injection.

433
00:24:06,205 --> 00:24:08,973
I feel I should say
something profound like,

434
00:24:08,975 --> 00:24:10,808
"One small step for man."

435
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:12,176
What's happening?

436
00:24:12,178 --> 00:24:14,339
Wells is about to blow up the city.

437
00:24:14,342 --> 00:24:16,089
All I can think of to say is I feel like

438
00:24:16,092 --> 00:24:18,418
I've waited for this day for centuries.

439
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:22,953
Without further ado.

440
00:25:01,894 --> 00:25:04,528
Dr. Wells?

441
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:06,931
Are you okay?

442
00:25:06,933 --> 00:25:10,501
Yeah, I'm great.

443
00:25:11,904 --> 00:25:15,172
I'm...

444
00:25:15,174 --> 00:25:17,041
Caitlin, do you think
you could have Ronnie

445
00:25:17,043 --> 00:25:19,214
run the Particle
Accelerator parameter numbers

446
00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:20,444
just one more time?

447
00:25:20,446 --> 00:25:22,079
Just for good measure.

448
00:25:22,081 --> 00:25:24,315
- Sure.
- Great.

449
00:25:24,317 --> 00:25:26,183
And, Caitlin,

450
00:25:26,185 --> 00:25:30,254
the bottle of Dom we've been saving.

451
00:25:30,256 --> 00:25:31,655
Is today the day?

452
00:25:31,657 --> 00:25:33,657
I think today might be the day.

453
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:36,227
- I'll go grab it.
- Great, be along in a minute.

454
00:25:39,198 --> 00:25:41,232
You got us on pins and
needles here, Dr. Wells.

455
00:25:41,234 --> 00:25:42,967
- Exciting isn't it?
- Yeah.

456
00:25:42,969 --> 00:25:45,302
Well, it's all thanks
to the team, right?

457
00:25:45,304 --> 00:25:48,939
Caitlin, fiancé Ronnie, Hartley.

458
00:25:48,941 --> 00:25:51,742
- Hmm.
- Hartley contributed.

459
00:25:51,744 --> 00:25:54,574
Especially you, Cisco.

460
00:25:54,577 --> 00:25:57,480
I have to say I have a vibe about you.

461
00:25:57,483 --> 00:26:01,452
About what you're destined to become.

462
00:26:01,454 --> 00:26:03,220
I want you to know I'm very eager

463
00:26:03,222 --> 00:26:05,389
to be along for that adventure.

464
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,994
Thank you, Dr. Wells.

465
00:26:10,004 --> 00:26:12,337
That means a great deal.

466
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:21,305
Oh, did you...

467
00:26:21,307 --> 00:26:23,474
I didn't.

468
00:26:25,371 --> 00:26:27,144
Shall we just go turn on an accelerator

469
00:26:27,146 --> 00:26:28,245
and pop some champagne?

470
00:26:28,247 --> 00:26:30,080
- I think...
- Okay.

471
00:26:36,989 --> 00:26:38,622
He's gone.

472
00:26:45,031 --> 00:26:47,131
Good evening, Barry Allen.

473
00:26:47,133 --> 00:26:48,866
I was not expecting you this soon.

474
00:26:48,868 --> 00:26:50,027
She knows you?

475
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,868
I know you as well, Nora West-Allen.

476
00:26:51,871 --> 00:26:53,652
Also known as XS.

477
00:26:53,655 --> 00:26:55,405
Fifth recruit in the
rebooted Legion of...

478
00:26:55,408 --> 00:26:56,582
Gideon,

479
00:26:56,585 --> 00:26:58,524
the particle accelerator
is about to explode.

480
00:26:58,527 --> 00:27:00,694
I need you to recalibrate
the system's chain reaction

481
00:27:00,697 --> 00:27:03,079
so some of the dark matter is
repositioned into this vial,

482
00:27:03,082 --> 00:27:04,882
and record no reports of this...

483
00:27:11,757 --> 00:27:12,790
Nora!

484
00:27:17,096 --> 00:27:20,064
You really hate him, don't you?

485
00:27:20,066 --> 00:27:21,699
Do you not know what he did?

486
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:26,570
I know he was your archenemy.

487
00:27:29,642 --> 00:27:33,010
He killed my mother...

488
00:27:33,012 --> 00:27:34,912
and our home

489
00:27:34,914 --> 00:27:36,691
when I was 11 years old.

490
00:27:36,694 --> 00:27:38,427
An 11-year-old boy.

491
00:27:40,047 --> 00:27:42,948
You know why he did it?

492
00:27:42,951 --> 00:27:46,386
He thought if I suffered a tragedy

493
00:27:46,389 --> 00:27:49,724
that was horrific
enough, I'd never recover

494
00:27:49,727 --> 00:27:51,293
and never become The Flash.

495
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,800
I... I didn't know that.

496
00:27:59,472 --> 00:28:01,472
There's probably a lot
that's happened to me

497
00:28:01,474 --> 00:28:03,496
that's not in The Flash museum.

498
00:28:09,148 --> 00:28:12,249
It's why you didn't want me
to come with you, isn't it?

499
00:28:12,251 --> 00:28:13,817
It's not because it was dangerous,

500
00:28:13,819 --> 00:28:16,387
or because of the timeline,

501
00:28:16,389 --> 00:28:18,128
but because you didn't want me

502
00:28:18,131 --> 00:28:19,796
to know these awful things about you

503
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:24,127
so it's not what I would
remember most when I went back.

504
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:27,164
You don't have to protect
me from this stuff.

505
00:28:27,166 --> 00:28:28,832
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't.

506
00:28:28,834 --> 00:28:31,702
Yes, yes, I do.

507
00:28:31,704 --> 00:28:33,103
You're my daughter.

508
00:28:33,105 --> 00:28:35,172
Yeah, and you're my father,

509
00:28:35,174 --> 00:28:38,042
and I just want to know my father.

510
00:28:47,453 --> 00:28:49,520
Recalibration complete.

511
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:55,192
Here we go.

512
00:29:15,748 --> 00:29:18,260
Dark matter retrieval successful.

513
00:29:24,334 --> 00:29:27,034
Let's go get our time back in place.

514
00:29:27,037 --> 00:29:28,350
Spinal cord trauma,

515
00:29:28,353 --> 00:29:30,193
he's lost all feeling
to his lower quadrants.

516
00:29:30,196 --> 00:29:31,269
That's Harrison Wells.

517
00:29:31,272 --> 00:29:32,863
Dr. Wells, I need you
to squeeze my hand.

518
00:29:32,865 --> 00:29:33,772
That's a good sign.

519
00:29:33,775 --> 00:29:35,924
24-year-old male, struck by lightning.

520
00:29:35,927 --> 00:29:37,960
Need a full trauma panel.

521
00:29:37,963 --> 00:29:39,802
Get him to bay one.

522
00:29:39,805 --> 00:29:41,839
What is happening to this city?

523
00:29:45,544 --> 00:29:47,179
Grace's room is on the fourth floor.

524
00:29:47,182 --> 00:29:48,345
This should work.

525
00:29:48,347 --> 00:29:49,813
Let's put it right here.

526
00:29:58,024 --> 00:29:59,590
We did it.

527
00:29:59,592 --> 00:30:01,992
Come on.

528
00:30:06,232 --> 00:30:09,033
Did you even go?

529
00:30:09,035 --> 00:30:10,658
Told you time travel was weird.

530
00:30:10,667 --> 00:30:12,934
- Everything worked?
- Yeah.

531
00:30:12,937 --> 00:30:14,537
Is Dwyer still at the hospital?

532
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,595
Hasn't left her side.

533
00:30:15,598 --> 00:30:16,807
Did you plant the transmitter?

534
00:30:16,809 --> 00:30:19,076
Yeah, we sure did.

535
00:30:19,078 --> 00:30:20,533
Let's go get Cicada.

536
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:51,972
You ready, Barry?

537
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:53,575
I'm ready.

538
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:26,173
Cicada.

539
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:29,843
Is that what you call me?

540
00:31:29,845 --> 00:31:31,345
Not all meta-humans

541
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:33,403
are responsible for
what happened to Grace.

542
00:31:33,406 --> 00:31:35,898
Yes, they are.

543
00:31:35,901 --> 00:31:39,585
The destruction they cause, the death,

544
00:31:39,588 --> 00:31:41,321
the pain.

545
00:31:41,323 --> 00:31:42,856
I know about pain and death,

546
00:31:42,858 --> 00:31:44,358
taking it out on the world.

547
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,693
That's not gonna help.
Think about Grace.

548
00:31:46,695 --> 00:31:49,413
She's all I think about, Flash.

549
00:31:49,416 --> 00:31:52,148
And I'm making the world safe for her.

550
00:31:52,151 --> 00:31:55,568
Every meta-human must go.

551
00:31:55,571 --> 00:31:57,504
Then what about you?

552
00:31:57,506 --> 00:31:59,020
You're a meta-human now.

553
00:31:59,023 --> 00:32:00,742
I am,

554
00:32:00,745 --> 00:32:05,304
and after you're gone, I'll join you.

555
00:32:09,752 --> 00:32:12,132
All four of you.

556
00:32:18,088 --> 00:32:19,326
Come on, work.

557
00:32:38,213 --> 00:32:40,514
- It worked.
- It worked.

558
00:32:40,516 --> 00:32:42,849
Let's see how you like it.

559
00:32:47,923 --> 00:32:50,320
Cisco, now.

560
00:32:50,323 --> 00:32:51,889
Breach it out of here!

561
00:32:56,398 --> 00:32:57,864
Gotcha.

562
00:32:57,866 --> 00:32:59,232
Oh, man.

563
00:32:59,234 --> 00:33:01,234
You look like you're having a day.

564
00:33:01,236 --> 00:33:04,404
Is it 'cause I just threw
your dagger into outer space,

565
00:33:04,406 --> 00:33:06,710
or 'cause you're just now
realizing you didn't kill me.

566
00:33:06,713 --> 00:33:08,579
We stopped you.

567
00:33:08,582 --> 00:33:11,884
You stop nothing.

568
00:33:20,789 --> 00:33:22,456
The satellite's tracking the dagger

569
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:24,291
back through the exosphere.

570
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:27,127
Guys, Cicada's recalling
the dagger back from space.

571
00:33:33,969 --> 00:33:35,469
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

572
00:34:01,472 --> 00:34:03,840
This ends now.

573
00:34:03,843 --> 00:34:05,374
Barry!

574
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:07,429
No!

575
00:34:20,082 --> 00:34:22,115
Let's dance, cricket freak.

576
00:34:35,632 --> 00:34:38,007
Dwyer's not popping up
in facial recognition.

577
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:41,011
And there's no dark matter
traces from his dagger.

578
00:34:41,013 --> 00:34:43,380
Well, he won't stay away
from his niece for long,

579
00:34:43,382 --> 00:34:45,921
and when he returns, we'll be ready.

580
00:34:45,924 --> 00:34:49,648
Yeah, we will, thanks to Killer Frost.

581
00:34:49,651 --> 00:34:51,050
I don't understand.

582
00:34:51,053 --> 00:34:52,695
How can she still come out?

583
00:34:52,698 --> 00:34:54,330
She didn't come from dark matter,

584
00:34:54,333 --> 00:34:57,727
so I guess she's immune
to Cicada's dagger.

585
00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:00,064
She just might be the key
to stopping Cicada for good.

586
00:35:00,066 --> 00:35:03,567
Maybe we should go check in with her.

587
00:35:03,569 --> 00:35:07,238
- What do you think?
- Yeah.

588
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,873
- Cricket freak, huh?
- Yeah.

589
00:35:08,875 --> 00:35:10,641
Just came out.

590
00:35:17,416 --> 00:35:18,716
Proud of you.

591
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:33,597
- Hey, "Sher-loke."
- Sherloque.

592
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:35,249
- Tea?
- No, thank you.

593
00:35:35,252 --> 00:35:37,519
Have you see my...

594
00:35:39,405 --> 00:35:40,938
- Journal.
- Yeah.

595
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:43,908
Forgive me, but couldn't help but notice

596
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:46,273
this composition.

597
00:35:46,276 --> 00:35:47,574
That's really nothing special.

598
00:35:47,577 --> 00:35:49,513
But it...

599
00:35:49,515 --> 00:35:51,715
feels like something special.

600
00:35:51,717 --> 00:35:54,885
I don't like to brag, but
speak a lot of languages

601
00:35:54,887 --> 00:35:57,187
and yet this one...

602
00:35:57,189 --> 00:35:58,789
this one I don't recognize.

603
00:35:58,791 --> 00:36:01,959
- It's a time language.
- Time language, really?

604
00:36:01,961 --> 00:36:04,624
It's used to record events

605
00:36:04,627 --> 00:36:06,425
regardless of changes in the timeline

606
00:36:06,428 --> 00:36:09,599
so no matter what happens
I'll always remember my dad.

607
00:36:09,602 --> 00:36:12,636
Hmm, where does one
learn something like that?

608
00:36:12,638 --> 00:36:15,639
Time travel school?

609
00:36:15,641 --> 00:36:18,142
I created it, actually.

610
00:36:21,347 --> 00:36:22,929
You created it?

611
00:36:22,932 --> 00:36:24,114
Mm-hmm.

612
00:36:26,218 --> 00:36:27,685
Clever girl.

613
00:36:30,289 --> 00:36:31,789
I forget myself.

614
00:36:31,791 --> 00:36:33,023
This is yours.

615
00:37:44,497 --> 00:37:46,130
They were the best.

616
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,566
Dad.

617
00:37:49,568 --> 00:37:53,070
- Dad, I didn't...
- It's all right.

618
00:37:53,072 --> 00:37:54,371
I understand.

619
00:37:59,378 --> 00:38:02,046
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

620
00:38:05,995 --> 00:38:07,684
Do you ever think about stopping

621
00:38:07,686 --> 00:38:09,353
what's about to happen?

622
00:38:14,427 --> 00:38:15,759
Every day.

623
00:38:19,432 --> 00:38:22,032
Thanks for bringing me with you today.

624
00:38:22,034 --> 00:38:23,734
It meant a lot.

625
00:38:24,877 --> 00:38:26,143
I'm glad you came.

626
00:38:46,258 --> 00:38:49,495
Hey, Old Man, come on.

627
00:38:49,498 --> 00:38:50,727
Come on.

628
00:38:56,268 --> 00:38:58,502
Old Man?

629
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:16,453
Good evening, Nora West-Allen.

630
00:39:16,455 --> 00:39:19,089
Gideon, another data entry.

631
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:30,299
Entry uploaded and recorded.

632
00:39:30,302 --> 00:39:31,995
Shall I send it to the same recipient?

633
00:39:31,998 --> 00:39:33,156
Yes.

634
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:34,557
Entry sent.

635
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:38,028
Would you like assistance
with anything else?

636
00:39:38,031 --> 00:39:40,610
Yes, send a personal message from me.

637
00:39:40,613 --> 00:39:43,013
What would you like it to say?

638
00:39:43,015 --> 00:39:46,350
Actually, I'll deliver it myself.

639
00:39:59,685 --> 00:40:01,276
We need to talk.

640
00:40:12,978 --> 00:40:14,745
Yes, Nora.

641
00:40:20,187 --> 00:40:22,251
Yes, we do.

642
00:41:25,584 --> 00:41:27,117
You failed.

643
00:41:31,991 --> 00:41:34,391
Why are you doing this?

644
00:41:34,393 --> 00:41:37,194
You did this to yourself,

645
00:41:37,196 --> 00:41:39,396
and now,

646
00:41:39,398 --> 00:41:41,667
all of you will perish.

647
00:41:44,846 --> 00:41:50,432
