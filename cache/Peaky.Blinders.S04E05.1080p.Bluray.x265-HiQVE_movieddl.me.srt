00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,880

I'm dying.

00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,920
You're drunk. Again.

169
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,200
I'm drunk again.

170
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,200
I am drunk again.

171
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,160
I need you to save me.

172
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,880
Tell me what you said to me
this morning.

173
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,560
Tell me... Tell me again.

174
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,400
Tell me.

175
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,440
Say it, say it, say it. Tell me.

176
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,840
We'll be back in our garden

177
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,160
before the time comes to plant
anything out.

178
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,400
Just one winter.

179
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,080
(GROGGILY) Just one winter.

180
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,360

182
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,800
They're coming, boys.

183

MICHAEL: No.

184
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,440
No fucking way.

185
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,680
You've never eaten hedgehog, Michael?

186
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,920
I'm getting back in this car.

187
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,360
Michael, you're number two
on Luca Changretta's hit list.

188
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,200
Yeah, and I'll stay in a hotel.

189
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,320
If you stay in a hotel,
I'll know where you are.

190
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,920
So will the people who take you there.

191
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,920
So will the people
who work in the hotel.

192
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,320
And hotels don't move around.

193
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,400
They don't even know
where they'll be tomorrow.

194
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,480
They follow the patron and the crows.

195
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,600
And if anyone
should come for you, Michael,

196
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,200
the Palmers and the Boswells
will put up a fair fight.

197
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,480

-I'll take them.
-Pain killers.

they'll heal you much quicker.

201

Show some respect, Mr Gray.

202
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,240
They've agreed to welcome you
on account of your blood.

203

Take your medicine.

Take the gun.

205
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,360
I won't be able to contact you,

206
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,360
till you phone me.

207
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,120
We'll make a plan.

208
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,280
Tommy says it won't be long.

209
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,280
Then we'll be free.

210

213
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,080
You're royalty up there, Michael.

214
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,000
ABERAMA:
Is that true, Mrs Gray?

215
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,560
What?

216
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,160
Don't I look like royalty?

217
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,120
Well, now that you mention it, you do.

218

When the police were after my dad,
he used to take us out.

233
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,480
We'd be gone for days living on
what he caught.

Oh... Do you have a sharp knife?

235
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,800
I heard you have second sight.

00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,760
I heard that you speak with the dead.

237

Yes.

238
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,640
Your wife's often around you.

239
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,880
She watches you.

240
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,680
Is she watching me now?

Came back
when I put my head in a noose.

245
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,480
It's like putting your head through
a window and seeing the whole world.

249
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:18,520
I believe it's you who's kept
Tommy Shelby alive all these years.

250
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,800
How we've kept each other alive...

251
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,320
That I didn't just put my head
through that window.

252
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,160
I climbed through it.

253
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,800
First, I thought it was madness,
but, no.

254
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,200
When you put your head
out of that window,

255
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,320

Let me make one thing clear, Mr Gold.

267
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,560
I just gave Michael a little speech

268
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,840
about how no one would know
where to find him.

269
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,760
But you'd know how to get him.

270
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,920
If any harm comes to Michael,

271
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,120
you shall have me as your enemy.

272
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,240
And none of your knives can kill me.

273
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,000
Do you understand?

274
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,280

And how is Tommy Shelby, OBE,
going to stop a revolution?

489
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,800
Jessie Eden has accepted
my invitation to dinner.

490
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,120
(SCOFFS) Oh, of course. I'm sorry.

491
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:11,520
Tommy Shelby is gonna stop
the revolution with his cock.

492
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,720
It's not her
the military are interested in.

493
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,280
It's the people around her.

494
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:22,360
The people like you used to be.
Like Freddie used to be.

495
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,880

she gives me the names
of the instigators,

498

500
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,560

501
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:44,600
at the bottom of the Saltley Canal
want to help the British military?

502
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:54,280
(SIGHS) Because I've been offered
three five-year contracts

504

509
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:18,440
Tommy, this can only happen
if you're still alive.

510
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,360
I'm planning on staying alive.

511

-No, we weren't.

Let's drink to something. You chose.

All right, well, since I invited you
for dinner, I thought I'd cook.

544
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,520
These two beauties
were shot this morning

545
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,280
by a poacher friend of mine

546
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,720
at Lord Packwood's estate.

547
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,840
I thought you'd like that. These here,

548

these were stolen from under his trees.

549
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:29,280
Mr Shelby, I came to talk business.

550
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:30,760
Yes.

551
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:32,920
So did I.

552
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:42,720
Wage cuts withdrawn, parity between
men and women guaranteed.

553
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,720
You can instruct your members
to return to work tomorrow.

554
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:49,400
And all I have to do in return

555
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,600
is tell you everything I know
about socialism.

556
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:53,720
That's what your sister said.

557
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,080
You don't like your gin?

558
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,200
It's okay.

559
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:02,960
It's okay.

560
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:08,000
What do you want to know
about the cause?

561
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,240
I'm approaching
the current political crisis

562
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:17,360
as I would approach a horse race.

563
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:22,120
Assessing the runners and the riders.

564
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,680
Now the favourite is,
of course, the King's horse,

565
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:33,760
but the King's horse
was also the favourite in 1913

566
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,600
when Emily Davis on
threw herself in front of it.

567
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:38,720
You know the names of Suffragettes?

568
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:40,880
I'm impressed.

569
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,600
Ah, everyone laughed at them at first,
but now look,

570
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:46,760
women with serious faces everywhere.

571
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,600
When I study a horse race, I study form,

572
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:57,320
and on the other horse, the one
that wants to beat the King's horse,

573
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:03,240
let's call her "Dangerous", shall we?
She's no form.

574
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,240
-That's what makes her so dangerous.
-Russia.

575
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:09,080
-Isn't that form?
-Ah.

576
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:13,080
The Russians are not like the English.
We're beer, they're petrol.

577
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,440
So I invited you here for dinner,

578
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:20,240
because you know people.

579
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:25,680
People that want to make this fight
real with guns and ammunition.

580
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,680
So before I place a bet
on who's gonna win,

581
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:32,320
I need to know how strong they are.

582
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,240
How serious they are.

583
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:39,080
Your concern is
that if the unthinkable happened,

584
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:43,360
you would find yourself
on the wrong side of the barricades.

585
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,320
Well, as you can see,

586
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:51,640
my natural side of the barricades,
is the same as yours and, as you know,

587
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,120
I once believed...

588
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:57,920
But the war changed you?

589
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:01,600
Yeah.

590
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,520
Man I love couldn't speak
when he got back.

591
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:09,640
Not one word.

592
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:14,320
I've said very few true words since.

are our enemy.

I do.

596
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,760
-Well, well.
-Yes.

597
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:31,680
Not just in my dreams. In the day now.

Well, well.

601
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:43,960
I've researched you.

602
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,160
We have researched you.

603
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:51,400
You've never been a friend
to the government.

604

that no amount of money allows you

to pass through the steel sheets

Yes, that I have learnt.

Yes.

You want it on fast or slow?
