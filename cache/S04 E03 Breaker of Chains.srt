1
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:01,288
You did this!

2
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:04,374
- We have to leave.
- Cersei: Take him!

3
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:08,962
Where is his wife?

4
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:10,756
Where's sansa?

5
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:15,302
Find her. Bar the gates of the city.
Seize every ship in the harbour.

6
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,597
- Where is she?
- No one leaves the capital!

7
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:50,837
Get in.

8
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:52,441
- Where are we going?
- Somewhere safe.

9
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:40,637
Up you go, my lady.

10
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:44,975
You'll be fine.

11
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,310
You're stronger than you know.

12
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,539
- Lord baelish?
- Petyr.

13
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,666
Are you hurt, my lady?

14
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:11,668
Good.

15
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:14,463
I'm sure you've had
quite a fright. Rest easy.

16
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:16,266
- The worst is past.
- Dontos: Lord baelish.

17
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:19,009
- I promised I'd get her to you safely.
- Softly, my friend.

18
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:21,928
Voices carry over water.

19
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:24,765
I should get back before
someone thinks to look for me.

20
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:26,975
First you'll want your pay.

21
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:30,187
- Ten thousand, was it?
- Ten thousand.

22
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:36,651
Wait!

23
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:40,739
Littlefinger: Shh.

24
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,866
You don't want the queen to hear, do you?

25
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,911
A thousand gold cloaks
are searching for you.

26
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,996
And if they found you,

27
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,166
how do you think they would punish
the girl who murdered the king?

28
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,126
I didn't murder anyone.

29
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,837
I know. But you must admit,
it looks suspicious.

30
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:57,923
The king who executed your father,

31
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:00,175
who tormented you for years,

32
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:02,761
and you fled the scene of his murder.

33
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,096
Why did you kill him?

34
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,808
Because he was a drunk and a fool,

35
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:10,727
and I don't trust drunk fools.

36
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:12,979
He saved me.

37
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:17,150
Saved you? My lady, he followed my orders.
Every one of them.

38
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:20,529
And he did it all for gold.

39
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:23,073
Money buys a man's silence for a time.

40
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:26,618
A bolt in the heart buys it forever.

41
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,706
He was helping me because I saved his life.

42
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:35,710
Yes, and he gave you a priceless necklace

43
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,922
that once belonged to his grandmother.

44
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,800
The last legacy of house hollard.

45
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,602
I had it made a few weeks ago.

46
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:57,065
What did I once tell you about the capital?

47
00:05:57,816 --> 00:05:59,734
"We're all liars here."

48
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,488
Come, my lady.

49
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:05,782
I know you've had a difficult day.

50
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,535
But you're safe now.

51
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,704
I promise you that.

52
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,540
You're safe with me,

53
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:16,084
sailing home.

54
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,925
So am I the queen?

55
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,969
More than you were with renly.

56
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,304
Less than you would have been

57
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:31,975
if Joffrey had done you the courtesy
of consummating the marriage before dying.

58
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:36,938
This would not be
an opportune moment to press the issue.

59
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,775
Clawing at his own throat,
looking to his mother to make it stop...

60
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:41,902
It was horrible.

61
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:44,321
The world is overflowing
with horrible things.

62
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,244
But they're all a tray
of cakes next to death.

63
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:51,411
They brought me your grandfather's body
when he died.

64
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,204
Made me look at it.

65
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,748
What was it like?

66
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:57,959
They took me to the
great hall. There he was.

67
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:02,672
The man I'd married
and suffered to father my children.

68
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:08,887
A great doughy lump I'd sat next to
at endless dinners and tedious gatherings.

69
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:10,513
There he was,

70
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,017
lying on a table.

71
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:20,106
One of my husbands
preferred the company of men

72
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,108
and was stabbed through the heart.

73
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:24,361
Another was happiest torturing animals

74
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,780
and was poisoned at our wedding feast.

75
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:28,573
- I must be cursed.
- Nonsense.

76
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:31,493
Your circumstances have improved markedly.

77
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:36,247
You may not have enjoyed watching him die,

78
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:38,184
but you enjoyed it more
than you would have enjoyed

79
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,168
being married to him,
I can promise you that.

80
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,295
But I would have been the queen.

81
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:44,381
Our alliance with the lannisters

82
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,926
remains every bit as necessary to them
as it is unpleasant for us.

83
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,305
You did wonderful work on Joffrey.

84
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:54,724
The next one should be easier.

85
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,903
Tywin: Your brother is dead.

86
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,991
Do you know what that means?

87
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:16,413
I'm not trying to trick you.

88
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,291
It means I'll become king.

89
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:23,545
Yes, you will become king.

90
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,839
What kind of king do you think you'll be?

91
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,342
- A good king?
- Tywin: Mmm.

92
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:31,469
I think so as well.

93
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:35,682
You've got the right temperament for it.

94
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:39,144
But what makes a good king? Hmm?

95
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:43,023
What is a good king's
single most important quality?

96
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:45,066
This is hardly the place or the time.

97
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:48,111
- Holiness?
- Hmm.

98
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:52,657
Baelor the blessed was holy.

99
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,868
And pious.

100
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,619
He built this sept.

101
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,749
He also named a 6-year-old boy high septon

102
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:03,960
because he thought
the boy could work miracles.

103
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:08,131
He ended up
fasting himself into an early grave

104
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:12,469
because food was of this world
and this world was sinful.

105
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:13,595
Hmm.

106
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:17,265
- Justice.
- Mmm.

107
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,477
A good king must bejust.

108
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:24,481
Orys I was just.

109
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,025
Everyone applauded his reforms,

110
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,110
nobles and commoners alike.

111
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:31,362
But he wasn't just for long.

112
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:35,658
He was murdered in his sleep
after less than a year by his own brother.

113
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,870
Was that truly just of him?

114
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:43,458
To abandon his subjects to an evil that
he was too gullible to recognise?

115
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:50,965
- What about strength?
- Yes.

116
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:53,259
Strength.

117
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:56,137
King Robert was strong.

118
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:58,264
He won the rebellion

119
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:01,142
and crushed the Targaryen dynasty.

120
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:06,606
And he attended three small council
meetings in 17 years.

121
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:10,985
He spent his time whoring and hunting
and drinking

122
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:13,363
until the last two killed him.

123
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:18,034
So, we have a man
who starves himself to death,

124
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,621
a man who lets his own brother murder him,

125
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:25,166
and a man who thinks that winning
and ruling are the same thing.

126
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:30,130
What do they all lack?

127
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,511
- Wisdom.
- Yes!

128
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,264
- Wisdom is what makes a good king.
- Yes.

129
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:43,226
But what is wisdom? Hmm?

130
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,774
A house with great wealth and fertile lands
asks you for your protection

131
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:55,155
against another house with a strong Navy
that could one day oppose you.

132
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:58,658
How do you know
which choice is wise and which isn't?

133
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,620
You've any experience
of treasuries and granaries

134
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:05,373
or shipyards and soldiers?

135
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:07,876
- No.
- Tywin: Of course not.

136
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:11,296
A wise king knows what he knows
and what he doesn't.

137
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,131
You're young.

138
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:19,888
A wise young king listens to his counsellors
and heeds their advice until he comes of age.

139
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:22,182
And the wisest kings

140
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:25,310
continue to listen to them long aftennards.

141
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,771
Your brother was not a wise king.

142
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:31,316
Your brother was not a good king.

143
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,443
If he had been,

144
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:36,112
perhaps he'd still be alive.

145
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:39,157
Now, as the king, you will have to marry.

146
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,659
Do you understand why?

147
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,286
Tommen: A king needs a queen.

148
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,205
Tywin: Yes, but why?

149
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,958
To further the family line.

150
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:51,211
- Do you know how that happens?
- Tommen: Yes.

151
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:55,965
Tywin: But has anyone
explained the details to you?

152
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,592
Tommen: I don't think so.

153
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:00,428
It's all relatively straightfon/vard.

154
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:03,640
- How are you?
- I'm all right.

155
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,516
You are. You will be.

156
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,602
I'll see to that.

157
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:15,109
Please give the queen
a moment alone with her son.

158
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:17,528
- Yes, my lord.
- All of you.

159
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:48,518
It was Tyrion.

160
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:51,646
He killed him.

161
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:55,650
He told me he would.

162
00:12:57,026 --> 00:13:01,155
"A day will come when you
think you are safe and happy,

163
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:04,784
"and yourjoy will turn to ashes
in your mouth."

164
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,580
That's what he said to me.

165
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,585
You saw it.

166
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,090
- You saw joff point at him just before he...
- I don't know what I saw.

167
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:25,054
Avenge him.

168
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,057
Avenge our son.

169
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:30,643
Kill Tyrion.

170
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:35,565
Tyrion's my brother.

171
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,233
Our brother.

172
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:40,045
There'll be a trial.
We'll get to the truth of what happened.

173
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,530
I don't want a trial.

174
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:45,908
He'll squirm his way to freedom
given the chance.

175
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,618
I want him dead.

176
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,417
Please, Jaime. You have to.

177
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:59,005
He was our son.

178
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,090
Our baby boy.

179
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:43,257
You're a hateful woman.

180
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:45,676
Why have the gods made me
love a hateful woman?

181
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,228
Jaime, not here, please.

182
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:57,855
Please.

183
00:14:58,606 --> 00:14:59,774
Stop it.

184
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,943
- Stop it.
- No.

185
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:05,446
Stop it.

186
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:10,993
Stop.

187
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,462
Stop. It's not right.

188
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:25,133
It's not right.

189
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:27,218
I don't care.

190
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:28,719
-Dont -i don't care.

191
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:31,013
- Jaime, don't.
- I don't care.

192
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,726
Arya: Gonna rain soon.

193
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,022
Where are we?

194
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:45,153
Near fairmarket, I think.

195
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:46,654
You think?

196
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,197
You don't have a map?

197
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:51,325
- No.
- Maybe we should get one.

198
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:54,495
Just point out the next map shop
you see, and I'll buy you one.

199
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:57,623
- How far is it to the eyrie?
- Far.

200
00:15:57,707 --> 00:15:59,309
And you're sure we're going the right way?

201
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:02,837
Believe me, girl,
I want you there as soon as I can.

202
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,339
Get my gold, be on my way.

203
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:08,134
- Where?
- Why do you care?

204
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,977
Might book passage across the narrow sea.

205
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,896
Fight as a sellsword.

206
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:22,648
Second sons, could be.

207
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:24,817
Seems like a good fit for me.

208
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:26,444
I'd like to see braavos one day.

209
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:27,737
Why braavos?

210
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:30,573
I have friends there.

211
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:32,700
I doubt it.

212
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:34,327
Man: Seven blessings to you.

213
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:40,833
- What do you want?
- This is my land.

214
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:42,960
If I'm standing on it, it's my land.

215
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:46,214
We were just watering the horses.
We'll be on our way.

216
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,220
Forgive my father.

217
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:54,680
He was wounded fighting in the war.

218
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:57,808
Our cottage burned down while he was gone,
and my mother with it.

219
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:03,189
He's never been the same.

220
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:09,946
Which house did he fight for?

221
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:17,286
The tullys of riverrun.

222
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,125
There's a storm coming.

223
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,669
You'll be wanting a roof tonight.

224
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:26,879
There's fresh hay in the barn.

225
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:29,840
And Sally here makes rabbit stew
just like her mom used to do.

226
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:36,681
We don't have much, but any man that
bled for house Tully is welcome to it.

227
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:46,315
Man: We ask the father to judge us
with mercy, accepting our human frailty.

228
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,442
We ask the mother to bless our crops,

229
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:51,571
so we may feed ourselves
and all who come to our door.

230
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:55,825
We ask the warrior to give us courage
in these days of strife and turmoil.

231
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,202
We ask the maiden to protect Sally's virtue

232
00:17:58,286 --> 00:17:59,972
and keep her from the
clutches of depravity.

233
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,747
You going to do all seven of the fuckers?

234
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:03,165
Arya: Father!

235
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:10,673
We ask the Smith to strengthen our hands
and our backs,

236
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,925
so we may finish the work required of us.

237
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:17,013
We ask the crone to guide us on our journey
from darkness to darkness.

238
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:21,642
And we ask the stranger not to kill us in
our beds tonight for no damn reason at all.

239
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:28,691
I'm so sorry.

240
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:49,712
Really good.

241
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:51,648
Man: Did you fight at the twins?

242
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:55,259
Call that a fight?
Slaughtering livestock more like.

243
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:58,095
The red wedding, they're calling it.

244
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:00,264
Walder frey committed sacrilege that day.

245
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:03,726
He shared bread and salt with the starks.
He offered them guest right.

246
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,811
Hound:
Guest right don't mean much any more.

247
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:08,147
It means something to me.

248
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,233
The gods will have their vengeance.

249
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:13,734
Frey will burn in the seventh hell
for what he did.

250
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,823
Things were different
when hoster Tully ruled the riverlands.

251
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:21,202
We had good years and bad years,
same as anyone, but we were safe.

252
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,454
Now with the freys,

253
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:27,333
raiders come plundering,
steal our food, steal our silver.

254
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,502
I was gonna send Sally north
to stay with my brother,

255
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:32,588
but the north's no better.
The whole country's gone sour.

256
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,423
You got any ale?

257
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,468
Afraid not.

258
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:43,099
How can a man not keep ale in his home?

259
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:48,187
You look like
you could really swing that sword.

260
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,439
A real warrior with proper training.

261
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:54,652
Those raiders wouldn't
stand a chance against you.

262
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,277
How would it be
if you stayed on till the new moon?

263
00:19:57,655 --> 00:20:00,116
I could use a man to
help with the farm work.

264
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,535
Sally does what she can,

265
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:04,203
but she can't lift a bale of hay.

266
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:06,997
And if any thieves came
looking for easy pickings,

267
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:09,834
one look at you,
I bet they'd run the other way.

268
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:13,129
Meaning no offence.

269
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:21,429
What'll you pay?

270
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:24,515
I don't have much.

271
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,934
But I have hidden a bit of silver
from the bandits.

272
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:30,813
Fair wages for fair work?

273
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:39,530
Fair wages for fair work.

274
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:00,760
Man: Ahhh!

275
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:14,690
Arya: What did you do?
Hound: Get your horse saddled.

276
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:17,693
- You told me you weren't a thief.
- I wasn't.

277
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:20,321
He took us in. He fed us and you...

278
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:23,866
Aye, he took us in. He's a good man,
and his daughter makes a nice stew.

279
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,826
And they'll both be dead come winter.

280
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,204
- You don't know that.
- I do.

281
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:31,457
He's weak. He can't protect himself.

282
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,793
They'll both be dead come winter.

283
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:35,419
Dead men don't need silver.

284
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:39,965
You're the worst shit
in the seven kingdoms.

285
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:42,968
There's plenty worse than me.

286
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:45,721
I just understand the way things are.

287
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:48,599
How many starks they got to behead
before you figure it out?

288
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:56,106
Ranger: Raper.

289
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,650
Horse thief.

290
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,360
Ninth-born son.

291
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:02,822
Raper. Thief.

292
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:04,907
Thief and raper.

293
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,451
Alliser: There he is, Sam the slayer.

294
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:09,829
Janos: Going to visit your wildling whore?

295
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:11,622
- She's not a whore.
- No?

296
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:14,083
Maybe I'll give her a copper tonight
and find out.

297
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,632
Samwell: They all think I'm lying.

298
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:23,592
About what?

299
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:25,678
Killing the white Walker.

300
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,304
You're not lying.

301
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,057
I'll never forget the way it screamed.

302
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:34,144
But you're the only one that saw it.

303
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:35,855
And they all think you're just a...

304
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:37,064
A what?

305
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:40,109
Awildling.

306
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,279
Gilly: My father hated that word.

307
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:47,950
- It's not a very nice word.
- I don't know.

308
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:52,246
It makes me sound a bit dangerous,
doesn't it?

309
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:07,887
So, are you all right?

310
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:10,347
No one bothering you?

311
00:23:10,431 --> 00:23:12,224
I get a lot of looks.

312
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:14,226
I hear them making theirjokes.

313
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:17,146
But no one's touched me,
if that's what you mean.

314
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,316
I worry about it sometimes.

315
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:22,776
All the time.

316
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:25,613
Why do you worry about it?

317
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:28,991
One hundred men, one woman.

318
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:31,535
They've got other things to think about.

319
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:33,621
That's the only thing they think about.

320
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:36,916
- You're being silly.
- I'm not being silly.

321
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:40,836
There's 100 men lying awake at night,
picturing you.

322
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:44,089
What about you?

323
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:47,551
What about me?

324
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,181
Gilly?

325
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:59,521
I worry about you.

326
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:06,028
Thank you.

327
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,613
For what?

328
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,823
For worrying about me.

329
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:16,914
I don't know if you're safe here.

330
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:19,208
They're my brothers,

331
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,627
but some of them were thieves
before they came here.

332
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,837
Some of them were rapers.

333
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:26,048
You saw what they
did at your father's keep.

334
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,884
So what are you saying?

335
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:36,892
Maybe you'd be safer in mole's town.

336
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:43,816
Are you bored of me?

337
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:45,776
Bored of you?

338
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,368
I want to protect you.

339
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:03,002
I'll get these to hobb.

340
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:05,254
Keep an eye on little Sam.

341
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:36,827
Your grace.

342
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:40,289
You're a literary man now.
What do you make of that?

343
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:54,094
- Joffrey?
- "The usurper, Joffrey Baratheon."

344
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:57,181
I said those words
when I tossed a leech into the fire,

345
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:59,975
filled with bastard blood.

346
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:01,810
A bastard you set free.

347
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:05,022
I am now faced with a great opportunity,

348
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,940
and I am powerless to take advantage of it.

349
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:08,209
I will find you an army, your grace.

350
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,873
- I've been working day and night...
- What progress have you made?

351
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:14,156
- I've rallied house peasebury to your cause.
- House peasebury.

352
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:18,327
- House musgood.
- House musgood.

353
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:19,912
- And house haigh.
- House haigh.

354
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:29,379
They don't have enough men between them
to raid a pantry.

355
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,132
Westeros is not the world, your grace.

356
00:26:32,216 --> 00:26:34,009
We need to look east for ships and men.

357
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:37,346
10,000 skilled soldiers
fight for the golden company.

358
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,491
- The golden company?
- They've never broken a contract.

359
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:40,516
They're sellswords.

360
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,410
We're willing to use blood magic
to put you on the throne,

361
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:44,436
but we're not willing to pay men to fight?

362
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,814
Now the red woman's magic is real.

363
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:49,024
Her visions and prophecies may be, too,

364
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:51,944
but I've never heard of visions
and prophecies winning a war.

365
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:54,321
Soldiers win wars. Soldiers on the ground.

366
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:55,614
It's dirty on the ground.

367
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:56,824
We don't have any gold.

368
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:58,659
Not yet.

369
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:07,126
If I do not press my claim,
my claim will be forgotten.

370
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:10,587
I will not become a page
in someone else's history book.

371
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:13,841
I'm running out of time, ser davos.

372
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,885
Which means you're running out of time.

373
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:23,559
You're late.

374
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,185
Davos: I'm sorry, Princess.

375
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:26,812
I thought you weren't coming.

376
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,106
The hand of the king
doesn't have much leisure time.

377
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:32,818
You won't be a very good hand if you
see the word knight and say "ka-nigit."

378
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,862
That happened once, weeks ago.

379
00:27:34,945 --> 00:27:36,822
You're your father's daughter, no mistake.

380
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:38,782
Bloody relentless, the both of you.

381
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:41,368
It's a new one today. Lots of tricky words.

382
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:43,579
But I think you can manage.

383
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:47,916
You'll never read well
if you move your lips.

384
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,085
That's how children do it.

385
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:59,511
"The life and adventures of elyo grivas

386
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:01,722
"first sword of braavos."

387
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,849
Thank you very much.

388
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:07,060
I like this one.
It's full of swordfights and pirates.

389
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:10,647
- You were a pirate once.
- No, I was a smuggler.

390
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,024
What's the difference?

391
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:14,776
If you're a famous smuggler,
you're not doing it right.

392
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:17,446
My father says a criminal is a criminal.

393
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:21,366
Your father lacks an appreciation
of the finer points of bad behaviour.

394
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:23,702
So do the braavosi.

395
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:25,345
- You've sailed to braavos?
- Of course.

396
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:28,290
Almost got beheaded by
a first sword of braavos.

397
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:32,628
I tried to explain to him the difference
between pirates and smugglers,

398
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:35,671
but he didn't seem any more interested
in the distinction than your father.

399
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:38,258
I suppose if you work
for the iron bank of braavos

400
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,719
and each one of your gold barges
is worth half a kingdom,

401
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:45,015
you tend not to be overly concerned
with the kind of distinction...

402
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:05,410
- What was that for?
- I need you to write a message.

403
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:07,496
You should write it yourself.
It's good practice.

404
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,414
It's too important for me.

405
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:12,417
I need a smart person to do it. Go on.

406
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:16,588
To the offices of the iron bank of braavos,

407
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:20,259
from Stannis Baratheon,
the one true king of Westeros.

408
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:21,802
But that's not you.

409
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:23,553
I need to get their attention.

410
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:26,181
Go. Write.

411
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:38,485
He's seen some adventures, hasn't he?

412
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:01,300
- Precious little thing.
- Thank you.

413
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:04,136
- What's his name?
- Sam.

414
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,887
Lovely.

415
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:08,765
- That the daddy?
- No.

416
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,225
Where's the daddy?

417
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:12,853
He's dead.

418
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,398
Where you from?

419
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:19,568
North of here.

420
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,737
North of here?

421
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:27,951
You a fucking wildling?

422
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:31,246
- Woman: Only room and board?
- That's right.

423
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:34,958
She'll clean and cook
and look after the other girls' babies.

424
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:38,378
Could find other work for her, too.

425
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:40,464
- No other work.
- Woman: There'd be money.

426
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:42,090
Give you a piece of it.

427
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:44,926
No other work.

428
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:09,076
Samwell: I promise to come back and visit
whenever I can.

429
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:14,581
You'll be safer here.

430
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:16,500
Who's gonna protect you
at castle black? Me?

431
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,795
You protected me north of the wall.

432
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,797
This is different.

433
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,300
They're brothers of the night's watch,
and I can't just stab them in the back.

434
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:28,303
And I can't run away,
which is what we did at craster's.

435
00:31:30,514 --> 00:31:31,807
You have to trust me.

436
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,684
It's for the best.

437
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,400
Best for you.

438
00:31:41,942 --> 00:31:43,819
Oh, gilly.

439
00:31:45,946 --> 00:31:47,114
Please don't...

440
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:22,357
Greedy.

441
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:34,327
I'm sorry. You're lovely,
I just never acquired the taste.

442
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:36,371
You're calling my beauty an acquired taste?

443
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:40,584
That's quite all right, lover.
There's more for you.

444
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,672
Your loss.

445
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:54,806
You like them both the
same? Boys and girls?

446
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:57,517
- Does that surprise you?
- Everyone has a preference.

447
00:32:57,601 --> 00:33:00,187
Then everyone is missing
half the world's pleasure.

448
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:05,192
The gods made that, and it delights me.

449
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:06,985
The gods made this,

450
00:33:07,903 --> 00:33:09,070
and it delights me.

451
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:12,157
When it comes to war, I fight for dorne.

452
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,869
When it comes to love,
I don't choose sides.

453
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:18,163
I hope I have as much stamina
when I'm your age.

454
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:19,956
What are you, 25?

455
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:21,333
Children.

456
00:33:23,627 --> 00:33:27,464
Someday, if you're lucky,
you will wake up and realise you are old.

457
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,674
That pretty ass of yours will sag,

458
00:33:29,758 --> 00:33:32,969
your belly will grow soft,
and your back will ache in the night,

459
00:33:33,053 --> 00:33:35,931
and grey hairs will sprout from your ears.

460
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:39,392
No one will want you any more.

461
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:42,562
Make sure you've fucked your fill
before that day.

462
00:33:44,064 --> 00:33:45,649
Did you?

463
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:49,402
He is a prince of dorne.

464
00:33:49,486 --> 00:33:54,783
Girls and boys will line up to fuck him
till the day he dies.

465
00:33:57,452 --> 00:34:00,539
They will all have to line up behind you.

466
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:08,547
- Prince oberyn.
- Lord tywin.

467
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,549
May we have the room?

468
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:15,702
Call my name if you need me, lover.

469
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:29,025
Would you like to sit?

470
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:31,027
No, thank you.

471
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:34,823
- Some wine?
- No, thank you.

472
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:38,702
I'm sorry about your grandson.

473
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:39,786
Are you?

474
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:43,498
I don't believe that a child is responsible
for the sins of his father.

475
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:46,960
Or his grandfather.

476
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:48,587
An awful way to die.

477
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:50,839
Which way is that?

478
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:54,092
Are you interrogating me, lord tywin?

479
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:55,635
Some believe the king choked.

480
00:34:56,094 --> 00:35:00,640
Some believe the sky is blue because we
live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant.

481
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,853
The king was poisoned.

482
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:07,981
I hear you studied poisons at the citadel.

483
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:10,400
I did. This is why I know.

484
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:13,361
Your hatred for my family
is rather well-known.

485
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:16,823
You arrive at the capital,
an expert in poisoning,

486
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:20,702
some days later
my grandson dies of poisoning.

487
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:22,203
Rather suspicious.

488
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,039
Why haven't you thrown me in a dungeon?

489
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:27,792
You spoke with Tyrion in this very brothel
on the day that you arrived.

490
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:32,172
- What did you discuss?
- You think we conspired together?

491
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:33,590
What did you discuss?

492
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:36,593
The death of my sister.

493
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:38,720
For which you blame me.

494
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:41,181
She was raped and murdered
by the mountain.

495
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:43,725
The mountain follows your orders.

496
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,268
Of course I blame you.

497
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:48,313
Here I stand unarmed, unguarded.

498
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:49,564
Should I be concerned?

499
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:53,068
You are unarmed and unguarded
because you know me better than that.

500
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:55,695
I am a man of reason.

501
00:35:56,029 --> 00:35:59,407
If I cut your throat today,
I will be drawn and quartered tomorrow.

502
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:03,244
Men at war commit all kinds of crimes
without their superiors' knowledge.

503
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:05,789
So you deny involvement in elia's murder?

504
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:08,583
Categorically.

505
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:20,053
I would like to speak with the mountain.

506
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:22,597
I'm sure he would enjoy speaking with you.

507
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:25,600
He might not enjoy it
as much as he thinks he would.

508
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:30,522
I could arrange for this meeting.

509
00:36:31,064 --> 00:36:34,401
But you want something in return.

510
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:39,072
There will be a trial for my son
and, as custom dictates,

511
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:41,950
three judges will render a verdict.

512
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,451
I will preside.

513
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:46,621
Mace Tyrell will serve as the second judge.

514
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:48,832
I would like you to be the third.

515
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:54,629
Not long ago,
the tyrells sided with renly Baratheon.

516
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:57,382
Declared themselves enemies of the throne.

517
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,551
Now they are our strongest allies.

518
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:02,137
Well, you made the Tyrell girl a queen.

519
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,432
Asking me to judge at your son's trial
isn't quite as tempting.

520
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:09,352
I would also invite you
to sit on the small council

521
00:37:09,436 --> 00:37:12,939
to serve as one of
the new king's principal advisors.

522
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:23,450
I never realised
you had such respect for dorne, lord tywin.

523
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:27,203
We are not the seven kingdoms
until dorne returns to the fold.

524
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:30,915
The king is dead.
The greyjoys are in open rebellion.

525
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:34,043
A wildling army marches on the wall.

526
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:38,381
And in the east,
a Targaryen girl has three dragons.

527
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:43,762
Before long,
she will turn her eyes to Westeros.

528
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:49,476
Only the dornish managed to resist
aegon Targaryen and his dragons.

529
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,187
You're saying you need us?

530
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:56,441
That must be hard for you to admit.

531
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,569
We need each other.

532
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:03,198
You help me serve justice to
the king's assassins,

533
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:06,034
and I will help you servejustice to elia's.

534
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,721
Podrick.

535
00:38:28,598 --> 00:38:29,933
Apologies for the stench.

536
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:32,336
I brought you some wine, my lord,
but they took it from me.

537
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:33,895
A noble effort.

538
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:36,231
They didn't find the candles, though.

539
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,775
A quill, some parchment,

540
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:41,528
duck sausage, almonds,

541
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:44,656
and some hard cheese.

542
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,282
You're a good lad.

543
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:48,576
Any word of shae?

544
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,245
I've heard nothing, my lord.

545
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,747
I suppose that's a good thing.

546
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:57,627
What are they saying about me out there?

547
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:01,756
You're to stand trial in a fortnight
for murdering the king.

548
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:05,760
- Do you believe I murdered Joffrey?
- No, my lord.

549
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:07,720
You didn't?

550
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:10,431
Gods, no.

551
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:14,769
The world is a better place without him,
but I had nothing to do with it.

552
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:19,566
I would like to think
if I were arranging a royal assassination,

553
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:21,752
I'd plan it in such a way that
I wouldn't be standing there,

554
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,570
gawking like a fool when the king died.

555
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:28,283
Trial in a fortnight.

556
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:31,286
Have they announced the judges yet?

557
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:36,666
- Your father.
- Of course.

558
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:39,836
Mace Tyrell.

559
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:42,714
Who will vote exactly
as my father tells him to vote.

560
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:45,884
- And prince oberyn of dorne.
- Oberyn?

561
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:49,888
Give it to my father.

562
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:52,181
He never fails to take advantage
of a family tragedy.

563
00:39:52,265 --> 00:39:55,935
I'm supposed to get a list
of names from you, my lord.

564
00:39:56,019 --> 00:39:58,521
Anyone who might testify on your behalf.

565
00:39:58,605 --> 00:40:00,231
Oh, I can call my own witnesses?

566
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:02,650
How generous of them.

567
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:04,527
Very well, my wife. Sansa.

568
00:40:04,611 --> 00:40:06,487
My lord, she's gone.

569
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:09,699
- Gone?
- No one's seen her since the wedding.

570
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:15,413
You don't think she...

571
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:22,170
No one had more cause to kill Joffrey
than sansa,

572
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,255
but the girl is no assassin.

573
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:27,425
Whoever killed the king
wanted me to lose my head for it.

574
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:31,012
And with my wife's disappearance,
it makes me seem that much more guilty.

575
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:33,932
- Podrick.
- Yes, my lord?

576
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:35,534
- They'll be following you now.
- Who will?

577
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:38,269
I don't know. They. The ominous they.

578
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:41,356
The man pulling the strings.
Or woman. My father.

579
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:44,901
Maybe Joffrey was too much work for him.

580
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:47,737
Sweet tommen will be
so much easier to handle.

581
00:40:48,488 --> 00:40:53,034
Whenever something bad happens to me, I
assume it's my sister that had a hand in it.

582
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:55,495
But say what you will of Cersei,

583
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:57,205
she loves her children.

584
00:40:57,330 --> 00:41:01,209
She is the only one I'm certain
had nothing to do with this murder.

585
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:05,964
Which makes it unique
as king's landing murders go.

586
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:08,091
Any other witnesses, my lord?

587
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:10,802
Varys could vouch for me, if he dared.

588
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:12,925
He's already been called
as a witness for the queen.

589
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:15,890
Of course. Fetch bronn.
I have a job for him.

590
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:17,701
I've already asked, my lord.
They won't let him see you.

591
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:18,768
Why not?

592
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:21,396
They say he's a known cutthroat
and your close associate.

593
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:22,981
He's under investigation himself.

594
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:26,317
And my brother?
Will they at least allow me to see Jaime?

595
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:27,485
I'll ask, my lord.

596
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:45,336
There's something else, my lord.

597
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:48,673
A man, I didn't know his face,

598
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,591
he came to ask if I'd testify against you.

599
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:54,178
Said I'd be named ser podrick Payne

600
00:41:54,262 --> 00:41:57,598
if I told the judges
you'd bought a poison called the strangler.

601
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:59,976
Ser podrick Payne?

602
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:04,105
- Has a nice ring to it. What did you tell him?
- I didn't tell them anything, my lord.

603
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:07,525
Are you going to accept their offer?

604
00:42:08,735 --> 00:42:11,529
- My lord.
- Testifying against me wasn't a suggestion.

605
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:14,866
If they can't tempt you with honey,
they'll choose something less sweet.

606
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:18,745
- You've been good to me, my lord.
- Pod, the trial's in a fortnight.

607
00:42:18,828 --> 00:42:20,455
They'll want an answer before that.

608
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,140
I already gave them an answer, my lord.

609
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:26,878
I will not have you dying on my behalf.

610
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:28,212
Do you hear me?

611
00:42:28,296 --> 00:42:30,965
If I have to take that long walk to
the executioner's block,

612
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:33,468
I don't want to see
your head already mounted.

613
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:36,220
- My lord.
- Pod, I am giving you an order.

614
00:42:37,305 --> 00:42:40,767
Go and find my brother.
Tell him I need him.

615
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:44,062
And get yourself out of king's landing
before it's too late.

616
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:48,733
This is farewell.

617
00:42:51,611 --> 00:42:53,780
Farewell, my lord.

618
00:42:58,576 --> 00:42:59,827
Pod.

619
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:07,168
There has never lived a more loyal squire.

620
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:32,485
Boy: Mother says it's time to eat.

621
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:36,197
What's she got boiling? Wait. Let me guess.

622
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,448
Both: Potatoes.

623
00:43:37,532 --> 00:43:40,785
No one boils a potato better than your mom.

624
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:42,328
She got...

625
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:44,664
Man: The wildlingsl

626
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:46,541
guymon!

627
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:49,794
Hide.

628
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:51,838
- Hide!
- Man: Run!

629
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:46,684
- You know how to get to castle black?
- Yes.

630
00:44:54,442 --> 00:44:56,694
Those your parents?

631
00:44:57,945 --> 00:44:59,739
Open your eyes.

632
00:45:00,907 --> 00:45:02,617
I'm going to eat them.

633
00:45:03,326 --> 00:45:04,660
Do you hear me?

634
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:07,371
I'm going to eat your dead mama

635
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:10,208
and your dead papa.

636
00:45:11,334 --> 00:45:14,128
Go tell the crows at castle black.

637
00:45:23,179 --> 00:45:26,033
Yarwyck: We need to teach them a lesson
about the way we deal with their kind.

638
00:45:26,057 --> 00:45:27,099
Men: Aye! Aye!

639
00:45:27,183 --> 00:45:31,187
Yarwyck: Three dozen bodies with slit
throats tossed off the top of the wall.

640
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:33,356
- Seems like that would be a good lesson.
- All: Aye!

641
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:35,983
If we go after them,
we'll be giving them what they want.

642
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:40,404
They want to draw us out,
pick us off a few at a time.

643
00:45:40,488 --> 00:45:43,241
We have just over 100 men.

644
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:46,577
And that's including stewards and builders.

645
00:45:47,328 --> 00:45:50,581
And me. We can't afford
to lose a single man.

646
00:45:51,249 --> 00:45:54,961
We must remember our first responsibility.

647
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:58,130
We are the watchers on the wall.

648
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,190
There's got to be a way to protect them.

649
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:05,263
You're a champion of the common people,
lord snow.

650
00:46:05,346 --> 00:46:08,140
What do you say
to brother pyp's proposition?

651
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:14,855
Mance rayder is coming.

652
00:46:16,524 --> 00:46:18,776
If the wildlings breach the wall,

653
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:21,612
they'll roll over everything
and everyone for 1,000 miles

654
00:46:21,696 --> 00:46:23,496
before they reach an
army that can stop them.

655
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:29,161
We need to shore up castle black

656
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:32,581
and defend the wall.

657
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:35,876
That is ourjob.

658
00:46:42,383 --> 00:46:43,843
Rangers returning.

659
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:52,476
Man: Help him.

660
00:46:54,103 --> 00:46:56,981
Thought you'd have blue eyes by now.

661
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,028
Alliser: What took you so long?

662
00:47:02,403 --> 00:47:04,613
- We were held up.
- By what?

663
00:47:05,114 --> 00:47:06,115
Chains.

664
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:09,785
We were guests of the mutineers
at craster's keep.

665
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:12,538
- And the mutineers stayed?
- They're not going anywhere.

666
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:15,708
They've got craster's food and his wives.

667
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:19,378
Dolorous edd: Poor girls.
Never thought they'd miss their daddy.

668
00:47:19,462 --> 00:47:21,088
Karl's running things now.

669
00:47:21,172 --> 00:47:23,632
He's the one who put a knife
through craster's mouth.

670
00:47:23,716 --> 00:47:25,316
We need to ride north and kill them all.

671
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:26,969
We just went over this, boy.

672
00:47:27,053 --> 00:47:29,513
- Justice can wait.
- It's not aboutjustice.

673
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:36,103
I told the wildlings we had over
1,000 men at castle black alone.

674
00:47:37,146 --> 00:47:39,523
Karl and the others know the truth
as well as we do.

675
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:43,545
How long do you think they'll keep
that information to themselves

676
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:46,572
when the wildlings are
peeling their fingernails off?

677
00:47:47,448 --> 00:47:50,659
Mance has all he needs to crush us,
he just doesn't know it yet.

678
00:47:50,785 --> 00:47:53,329
As soon as he gets his hands on them,
he will.

679
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:56,749
Then he'll throw his full strength at us.

680
00:47:57,416 --> 00:48:00,211
And even if every one of us
kills 100 wildlings,

681
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:02,880
there's still not a thing
we can do to stop them.

682
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:07,468
I don't think I can kill 100 wildlings.

683
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:12,616
Daenerys: Are they attacking?

684
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:15,202
Jorah: A single rider.

685
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:18,622
A champion of meereen.

686
00:49:18,706 --> 00:49:21,709
They want you to send your own champion
against him.

687
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:49,487
What is he doing?

688
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:52,281
I believe he means to...

689
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:02,875
He says that
we're an army of men without man parts.

690
00:50:03,209 --> 00:50:05,586
He claims you are no woman at all,
but a man who

691
00:50:06,921 --> 00:50:09,048
hides his cock in his own arsehole.

692
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:12,092
Ignore him, your grace.
These are meaningless words.

693
00:50:12,176 --> 00:50:16,430
They're not meaningless if half the city
you intend to take is listening to them.

694
00:50:19,767 --> 00:50:22,645
I have something to say
to the people of meereen.

695
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:25,689
First, I will need this one to be quiet.

696
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:28,859
Do I have a champion?

697
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:32,363
Allow me this honour, mother of dragons.

698
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,782
I will not disappoint you.

699
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:36,801
You are the commander of the unsullied.

700
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:38,786
I cannot risk you.

701
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:42,623
Your grace, I've won more single combats
than any man alive.

702
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:44,917
Which is why you must remain by my side.

703
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:48,921
I've been by your side
longer than any of them, khaleesi.

704
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:50,589
Let me stand for you today as well.

705
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:52,550
You are my most trusted advisor,

706
00:50:52,633 --> 00:50:55,511
my most valued general,
and my dearest friend.

707
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:57,304
I will not gamble with your life.

708
00:50:57,513 --> 00:50:59,932
Daario: I was the last to join your army.

709
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:02,184
I'm not your general
or a member of your queensguard

710
00:51:02,268 --> 00:51:03,668
or the commander of your unsullied.

711
00:51:03,811 --> 00:51:06,981
My mother was a whore. I come from nothing.

712
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:08,983
I will return to nothing.

713
00:51:10,651 --> 00:51:12,820
Let me kill this man for you.

714
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:15,364
Very well.

715
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:16,824
You have quite an audience.

716
00:51:17,825 --> 00:51:20,327
Make it worth their while.

717
00:51:21,412 --> 00:51:23,038
He is very brave, your grace.

718
00:51:23,122 --> 00:51:24,456
Yes, win or lose,

719
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:26,584
as long as the whole city is watching.

720
00:51:38,846 --> 00:51:40,306
You sure you don't want a horse?

721
00:51:40,723 --> 00:51:42,057
Daario: Why would I want a horse?

722
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:44,643
Horses are faster than men.

723
00:51:45,436 --> 00:51:47,438
Horses are dumber than men.

724
00:53:06,767 --> 00:53:09,269
I am Daenerys stormborn.

725
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:17,236
Your masters may have
told you lies about me,

726
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:19,363
or they may have told you nothing.

727
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:20,948
It does not matter.

728
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:23,951
I have nothing to say to them.

729
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:26,537
I speak only to you.

730
00:53:28,956 --> 00:53:30,708
First, I went to astapor.

731
00:53:30,833 --> 00:53:32,960
Those who were slaves in astapor,

732
00:53:33,419 --> 00:53:35,587
now stand behind me,

733
00:53:36,714 --> 00:53:37,965
free.

734
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:41,593
Next I went to yunkai.

735
00:53:41,677 --> 00:53:43,721
Those who were slaves in yunkai,

736
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:46,807
now stand behind me,

737
00:53:47,683 --> 00:53:48,851
free.

738
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:53,480
Now I have come to meereen.

739
00:53:54,982 --> 00:53:58,277
I am not your enemy.

740
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:01,864
Your enemy is beside you.

741
00:54:02,614 --> 00:54:07,327
Your enemy steals and
murders your children.

742
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:12,624
Your enemy has nothing for you
but chains and suffering

743
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,877
and commands.

744
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:18,839
I did not bring you commands.

745
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:21,633
I bring you a choice.

746
00:54:22,843 --> 00:54:26,013
And I bring your enemies what they deserve.

747
00:54:29,016 --> 00:54:30,642
Fonnard!

748
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:43,363
Fire!
