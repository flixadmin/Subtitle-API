1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:03,588
<i>Previously on</i>
Gotham...

2
00:00:03,755 --> 00:00:04,881
<i>You can still run.</i>

3
00:00:05,048 --> 00:00:06,383
<i>Find Lee, have a life.</i>

4
00:00:06,549 --> 00:00:08,134
- I have to clear my name.
- But how?

5
00:00:08,301 --> 00:00:10,136
You're sane.
It would be unethical

6
00:00:10,303 --> 00:00:11,846
and illegal to keep you confined.

7
00:00:12,013 --> 00:00:13,890
If you keep releasing lunatics,

8
00:00:14,057 --> 00:00:16,267
<i>you're going to get a bad reputation.</i>

9
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:18,103
- Matches Malone.
- We've met before?

10
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:20,271
You killed my parents. Who hired you?

11
00:00:20,438 --> 00:00:21,648
You'll never know their name.

12
00:00:22,732 --> 00:00:23,733
Bruce.

13
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:24,901
He's in there.

14
00:00:30,031 --> 00:00:31,116
<i>Hello, Kristen.</i>

15
00:00:32,701 --> 00:00:33,827
How did you become this?

16
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:35,328
This is who I am.

17
00:00:35,495 --> 00:00:37,789
That's what made it so easy to frame you.

18
00:00:37,956 --> 00:00:39,207
<i>Drop the gun!</i>

19
00:00:44,421 --> 00:00:45,422
Oh, crud.

20
00:00:45,588 --> 00:00:46,881
So, when are you coming back to work?

21
00:00:47,132 --> 00:00:49,759
I promised Bruce Wayne
I'd solve his parents' murder.

22
00:00:49,926 --> 00:00:51,010
I have to do that first.

23
00:00:51,177 --> 00:00:53,138
The Wayne case is closed, Jim.
The perp is dead.

24
00:00:53,304 --> 00:00:55,140
<i>But who hired him?
I need to find out.</i>

25
00:00:55,849 --> 00:00:57,016
Good morning, Victor.

26
00:00:57,183 --> 00:00:58,226
How is it I'm not dead?

27
00:00:58,393 --> 00:01:00,228
Anything above freezing will kill you.

28
00:01:00,395 --> 00:01:03,148
<i>But never fear,
you won't be locked in there forever.</i>

29
00:01:03,523 --> 00:01:07,068
<i>You do know that Mr. Lucius Fox
fixed your old man's computer?</i>

30
00:01:07,235 --> 00:01:10,321
But I will not have you put that
little girl's life in danger.

31
00:01:10,488 --> 00:01:12,323
It's either the work or it's her.

32
00:01:12,657 --> 00:01:14,451
- I'm not going back.
- What?

33
00:01:14,617 --> 00:01:15,618
My place is here.

34
00:01:15,785 --> 00:01:17,078
Have a great life, Bruce Wayne.

35
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:22,625
Hi, Jim.

36
00:01:27,297 --> 00:01:29,299
Hands up. Hands up!

37
00:01:29,466 --> 00:01:30,717
Okay. Look.

38
00:01:31,342 --> 00:01:32,343
Better?

39
00:01:33,386 --> 00:01:34,512
Inside.

40
00:01:35,638 --> 00:01:37,140
Keep them up. Face the wall.

41
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:43,188
What are you doing here?
You're supposed to be in Arkham.

42
00:01:43,354 --> 00:01:44,898
And you're supposed to be in Blackgate.

43
00:01:45,064 --> 00:01:48,026
I cleared my name. I'll ask you again.
What are you doing here?

44
00:01:49,277 --> 00:01:50,361
I was released.

45
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:52,989
Call them. You'll see.

46
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:56,785
I'm telling the truth. It's what I do now.

47
00:01:58,077 --> 00:01:59,120
That's hard to believe.

48
00:01:59,704 --> 00:02:00,705
Which part?

49
00:02:00,872 --> 00:02:04,209
I swear to God, after the day I've had,
I have no problem shooting you.

50
00:02:04,876 --> 00:02:06,002
Hey, look, I believe you.

51
00:02:09,923 --> 00:02:11,549
Look, when I came out of the coma,

52
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:17,931
the memories I had were horrifying,
like waking up from a nightmare.

53
00:02:18,807 --> 00:02:22,644
But the person who did those things,
that's not me.

54
00:02:27,106 --> 00:02:30,068
So they released you, just like that?

55
00:02:30,693 --> 00:02:32,403
Well, not right away.

56
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:36,407
I mean, I had some issues
to work through, obviously.

57
00:02:37,283 --> 00:02:40,411
But yes, I'm better, Jim.

58
00:02:42,789 --> 00:02:43,915
I'm totally sane.

59
00:02:46,584 --> 00:02:47,710
I really am.

60
00:02:51,172 --> 00:02:52,382
I'm happy for you.

61
00:02:54,342 --> 00:02:55,426
Please, go.

62
00:02:56,678 --> 00:02:58,012
You don't believe me, do you?

63
00:02:58,471 --> 00:02:59,931
Frankly, I don't care.

64
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:03,810
- What? And that's it?
- I have work to do.

65
00:03:06,896 --> 00:03:10,066
The Lady. You're investigating
the Wayne murder, huh?

66
00:03:10,692 --> 00:03:13,069
I've heard of her.
You think she's involved?

67
00:03:13,611 --> 00:03:14,946
'Cause I could help you with this.

68
00:03:16,447 --> 00:03:17,490
No, thanks.

69
00:03:17,657 --> 00:03:19,784
Okay, well, maybe
it was a mistake to come,

70
00:03:19,951 --> 00:03:21,911
but listen, could you just
do one more thing for me?

71
00:03:23,663 --> 00:03:24,873
Could you say my name?

72
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,710
Goodbye, Barbara.

73
00:03:41,347 --> 00:03:42,515
Hey, Harvey.

74
00:03:44,726 --> 00:03:46,185
Jim will catch you up.

75
00:03:50,148 --> 00:03:51,316
Jim!

76
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,401
Jim!

77
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,117
You've been at it all night, Master Bruce.

78
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:03,870
I need to try
and get some food down your neck.

79
00:04:04,162 --> 00:04:05,622
Do I smell sausage?

80
00:04:05,997 --> 00:04:09,250
Chipolatas, dear Mr. Fox.
I've prepared a full English upstairs.

81
00:04:09,626 --> 00:04:12,962
I have no idea if that's a "yes,"
but I'm starving. Let's eat.

82
00:04:13,338 --> 00:04:15,006
I think I found something.

83
00:04:15,381 --> 00:04:17,842
Your father's files are still running
through the decryption program.

84
00:04:18,009 --> 00:04:20,219
It could take weeks
before we know what we have.

85
00:04:20,386 --> 00:04:22,472
Yes, but his calendar
was only password protected.

86
00:04:23,348 --> 00:04:24,682
It was "Bruce," just like the lock.

87
00:04:24,891 --> 00:04:26,017
<i>Here, the week of his murder,</i>

88
00:04:26,643 --> 00:04:28,686
<i>he was supposed to meet a woman
named Karen Jennings</i>

89
00:04:28,853 --> 00:04:30,897
about something called Pinewood Farms.

90
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:35,318
Oh, Pinewood Farms?
Sounds, uh, rather quaint.

91
00:04:35,485 --> 00:04:36,694
Or not.

92
00:04:36,861 --> 00:04:40,907
<i>Most of Wayne Enterprises' black op
programs had code names like that.</i>

93
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:46,037
Running Brook, Windy Ridge.
A bland name covering up a nasty business.

94
00:04:46,746 --> 00:04:49,374
This could be what my father
was investigating when he was killed.

95
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:53,544
I think we might be getting a tad ahead
of ourselves here, Master Bruce.

96
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:57,632
I mean, how covert could it possibly be
if it's on your old man's calendar?

97
00:04:57,799 --> 00:04:59,717
I'll run Karen's name through HR
when I get into work,

98
00:04:59,884 --> 00:05:01,052
<i>see if there's even a connection.</i>

99
00:05:01,219 --> 00:05:02,470
My father had her address.

100
00:05:02,762 --> 00:05:03,805
She lives somewhere
right outside the city.

101
00:05:03,972 --> 00:05:07,517
I think we should just wait and see what
Mr. Fox comes up with first, Master Bruce.

102
00:05:07,684 --> 00:05:11,813
I'm done waiting, Alfred.
I'm going up there, with or without you.

103
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,481
Imagine my surprise.

104
00:05:13,648 --> 00:05:15,233
You are going to eat something on the way!

105
00:05:22,448 --> 00:05:25,451
Now that we know Matches Malone was
the trigger man, we can work backwards.

106
00:05:25,618 --> 00:05:28,121
His file has him working primarily
with two contractors.

107
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:30,748
One's dead.
The other one's known as the Lady.

108
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:35,044
Her? She's the one that sent the assassins
after you at Galavan's penthouse.

109
00:05:35,211 --> 00:05:36,587
Yeah, her. You know where she's at?

110
00:05:36,754 --> 00:05:37,755
In the wind.

111
00:05:37,964 --> 00:05:40,508
She went out of business
after you killed her A-team.

112
00:05:40,967 --> 00:05:42,969
Put her rep in the toilet. Ironic, huh?

113
00:05:43,761 --> 00:05:47,265
At least I have a list of her known
associates. It'll have to do for now.

114
00:05:47,932 --> 00:05:49,183
Someone must know where she is.

115
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,769
Look, her known associates
are professional hit men.

116
00:05:52,437 --> 00:05:54,230
Come back to GCPD.

117
00:05:54,397 --> 00:05:57,150
You'll have resources,
not to mention, you know, me.

118
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:00,403
Yeah, and I'd have Barnes
looking over my shoulder.

119
00:06:00,611 --> 00:06:02,864
I need to be able to do things my way,
at least for now.

120
00:06:03,114 --> 00:06:04,866
All right, but don't take
too much time, okay?

121
00:06:05,033 --> 00:06:06,242
I'm supposed to be training Alvarez.

122
00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:08,494
It's like trying to teach a halibut
how to put on socks.

123
00:06:08,661 --> 00:06:09,662
Yeah.

124
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,664
Is that it?

125
00:06:11,956 --> 00:06:15,710
You don't carry a badge anymore,
partner, remember, hmm?

126
00:06:15,877 --> 00:06:18,671
I think you need to grab a few items
from the whammy drawer.

127
00:06:20,131 --> 00:06:21,716
Can you believe
they let Barbara out of Arkham?

128
00:06:21,883 --> 00:06:23,676
First Penguin, then her?

129
00:06:23,843 --> 00:06:25,553
What, they don't have locks on the doors?

130
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,473
Good choice.

131
00:06:33,061 --> 00:06:34,062
Hey, Jim?

132
00:06:35,438 --> 00:06:36,689
Be careful out there.

133
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:39,400
Always.

134
00:06:41,277 --> 00:06:43,446
It's gonna be a bad day
for the hit men of Gotham.

135
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,627
I said, where's the Lady?

136
00:06:57,794 --> 00:06:58,920
No one knows!

137
00:07:00,004 --> 00:07:01,005
Wrong answer.

138
00:07:03,508 --> 00:07:06,552
- Someone knows.
- I don't! I swear!

139
00:07:14,352 --> 00:07:15,353
Where is she?

140
00:07:15,728 --> 00:07:18,439
She might be at a club called the Artemis.

141
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:19,941
Thank you.

142
00:07:41,796 --> 00:07:43,631
The moment has arrived, Ms. Peabody.

143
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:50,179
Our success here could finally free
humanity from the shackles of mortality.

144
00:07:50,346 --> 00:07:54,517
As you said the first dozen times
we attempted reanimation, Professor,

145
00:07:54,851 --> 00:07:55,893
<i>and failed.</i>

146
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,355
Oh, but I have a very good feeling
about Patient 44.

147
00:07:59,522 --> 00:08:01,941
You need to be more positive.

148
00:08:02,817 --> 00:08:06,612
Someone at Wayne Enterprises
ran a search for Karen Jennings.

149
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:10,366
Do you think she's been found?

150
00:08:10,575 --> 00:08:12,577
I don't see how. We've never been able to.

151
00:08:12,743 --> 00:08:14,287
But someone is looking.

152
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:16,581
She was our first.

153
00:08:17,415 --> 00:08:20,751
One small stroke
on the canvas of possibility.

154
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:22,545
Such promise, do you remember?

155
00:08:22,962 --> 00:08:26,883
I remember the orderlies she maimed
and the two she killed.

156
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:29,343
Creation is always so violent.

157
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:30,511
<i>She could expose us.</i>

158
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:33,890
Oh, Karen, who's looking for you?

159
00:08:35,016 --> 00:08:36,934
Do they know what you've become?

160
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:41,939
What I turned you into?

161
00:09:07,173 --> 00:09:09,300
Nope. No joy, never mind.

162
00:09:09,717 --> 00:09:12,970
Still kind of nice to get out the manor,
have a little drive in the country.

163
00:09:14,597 --> 00:09:17,225
<i>Oh, that's terrific, isn't it?
She's made a bloody tea leaf out of you.</i>

164
00:09:17,892 --> 00:09:20,811
"Street smarts"? Streets smarts, my eye.

165
00:09:21,312 --> 00:09:24,106
Shush, Alfred.
These are merely technical skills.

166
00:09:24,273 --> 00:09:26,025
- Oh.
- Morally neutral.

167
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:58,432
What is it?

168
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:05,564
<i>Careful, Master Bruce.</i>

169
00:10:05,773 --> 00:10:07,608
She's got some kind
of weird hunting knife.

170
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:16,951
We don't wanna hurt you.

171
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,454
What're you doing?
Raise your gun. Raise your gun.

172
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:21,956
My name is Bruce Wayne.

173
00:10:24,292 --> 00:10:25,584
I just wanna talk to you.

174
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:28,713
Bruce Wayne?

175
00:10:29,672 --> 00:10:31,215
You're Bruce Wayne?

176
00:10:32,508 --> 00:10:33,551
That's far enough.

177
00:10:34,677 --> 00:10:35,678
Drop the knife.

178
00:10:35,845 --> 00:10:37,013
It's not a knife.

179
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:41,058
Whatever it was you used to do this to me,
just drop it right now.

180
00:10:41,225 --> 00:10:42,351
I can't.

181
00:10:58,534 --> 00:11:00,578
- Listen to me--
- That's far enough.

182
00:11:00,745 --> 00:11:01,746
Alfred!

183
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:03,581
Look around you, Master Bruce.

184
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:10,796
Listen, I have no idea what you are,
but whatever that thing is,

185
00:11:12,048 --> 00:11:13,174
<i>it's bloody dangerous.</i>

186
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:17,553
Do you know who I am?

187
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:19,722
<i>You seemed to recognize me.</i>

188
00:11:19,889 --> 00:11:20,973
How did you find me?

189
00:11:21,891 --> 00:11:25,227
My father, Thomas Wayne, came here
the week before he died.

190
00:11:27,355 --> 00:11:28,564
He had it in his calendar.

191
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:31,776
His calendar? Great. Were you followed?

192
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,321
No. I don't know. By who?

193
00:11:36,322 --> 00:11:38,783
No, no, we weren't followed.

194
00:11:39,283 --> 00:11:41,285
Good.
Then you can leave.

195
00:11:42,453 --> 00:11:43,996
Not until you answer my questions.

196
00:11:44,163 --> 00:11:46,874
I know my father came to talk to you
about something called Pinewood Farms.

197
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:48,042
What is that?

198
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:50,252
God. You don't know anything, do you?

199
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:51,629
So tell me.

200
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:56,133
Do you not understand
that these people will kill you?

201
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,718
I've been trying to tell him that.

202
00:11:59,637 --> 00:12:01,013
I'm not afraid to die.

203
00:12:02,014 --> 00:12:03,391
Not if it means doing the right thing.

204
00:12:03,641 --> 00:12:06,894
Yeah? How'd that work out for your dad?

205
00:12:09,522 --> 00:12:12,233
You have to go.
It's not safe for you here.

206
00:12:14,235 --> 00:12:15,319
I don't care.

207
00:12:17,488 --> 00:12:21,492
Whatever my father was investigating
got him and my mom killed.

208
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:25,287
You're the first person I've found
who might know why. Please.

209
00:12:27,248 --> 00:12:29,083
You have to tell me what he was doing.

210
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:43,097
The Artemis is a private club, sir.

211
00:12:43,973 --> 00:12:46,183
I need to see if someone's inside.
It'll just take a minute.

212
00:12:46,976 --> 00:12:48,978
Members only.

213
00:12:49,311 --> 00:12:50,521
Jim?

214
00:12:55,276 --> 00:12:56,402
What a coincidence.

215
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:00,531
Can I borrow him a moment?

216
00:13:10,374 --> 00:13:12,209
Did I not make myself clear last night?

217
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:13,711
Oh, you did.

218
00:13:13,878 --> 00:13:15,796
And I wanted to respect your boundaries,

219
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:19,758
but I was wondering if you knew
that this is a women's-only club.

220
00:13:20,092 --> 00:13:23,888
Plus, its members are, shall we say,
of a criminal persuasion.

221
00:13:24,138 --> 00:13:25,139
Hmm?

222
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:28,017
Didn't think so, which is why I'm here.

223
00:13:28,684 --> 00:13:29,852
Let me guess.

224
00:13:30,728 --> 00:13:32,146
You're gonna talk to the Lady for me,

225
00:13:32,313 --> 00:13:35,941
get the information I need
if I just, what, trust you?

226
00:13:36,442 --> 00:13:38,652
No one likes a smarty pants.
So what's your plan, then?

227
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:39,820
- My plan?
- Mmm-hmm.

228
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:41,572
My plan is to stick a gun
in the Lady's face

229
00:13:41,739 --> 00:13:43,908
and have her beg me
not to pull the trigger

230
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:46,243
until she tells me
everything I want to know.

231
00:13:46,494 --> 00:13:50,080
The Gordon special. I remember it well.

232
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:53,751
Problem is you're not a cop anymore.

233
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:55,544
Why is that by the way?

234
00:13:57,129 --> 00:14:00,090
The point is,
if you go in there guns blazing,

235
00:14:00,257 --> 00:14:02,134
the Lady will disappear,
probably for good.

236
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,596
I can go inside and get you what you want.

237
00:14:06,597 --> 00:14:07,765
What do you have to lose?

238
00:14:12,478 --> 00:14:13,646
Why are you doing this?

239
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:18,150
I was there, remember?

240
00:14:19,068 --> 00:14:20,945
When you first caught the Wayne case?

241
00:14:22,446 --> 00:14:23,822
I know what it means to you.

242
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:26,951
You think that if you can solve it,

243
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:30,079
you can close the door on the past

244
00:14:30,246 --> 00:14:34,458
and maybe, just maybe, it will stay shut,

245
00:14:35,626 --> 00:14:37,294
and then you'll be able to start over.

246
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,006
And you really have to ask me
why I'm doing this?

247
00:15:02,486 --> 00:15:03,612
Buy a girl a drink?

248
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,283
Have we met?

249
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:09,827
No, but I'm kind of famous.

250
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:13,330
Oh...

251
00:15:13,706 --> 00:15:16,667
The notorious Barbara Kean. Please.

252
00:15:24,008 --> 00:15:25,175
Sorry about your hand.

253
00:15:26,218 --> 00:15:27,595
I don't get many visitors.

254
00:15:28,304 --> 00:15:29,763
You, uh, spooked me.

255
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,057
Wait, what, we, we spooked you?

256
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,435
How long have you lived here?

257
00:15:34,685 --> 00:15:37,688
Ten years. Ever since Pinewood.

258
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:42,026
Is that where you got that?

259
00:15:43,819 --> 00:15:47,698
Pinewood Farms was a bioengineering
program at Wayne Enterprises,

260
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:49,742
the kind that was kept off the books.

261
00:15:50,451 --> 00:15:51,744
I was one of their first volunteers.

262
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,037
What? You volunteered for that, did you?

263
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:54,580
I didn't have many options at the time.

264
00:15:55,706 --> 00:15:56,707
I was at Blackgate.

265
00:15:56,874 --> 00:15:58,667
Blackgate? Nice.

266
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:01,295
I take it you weren't a guard, then?

267
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:03,881
I was born with a crippled arm.

268
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:10,888
Growing up, my father liked two things,
booze and beating his deformed daughter.

269
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:13,474
One night, I fought back.

270
00:16:14,475 --> 00:16:17,895
He fell down the stairs
and broke his neck.

271
00:16:19,772 --> 00:16:21,106
I went to Blackgate for murder.

272
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:23,150
But that's self-defense.

273
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,902
Well, people are scared of different.

274
00:16:26,195 --> 00:16:27,613
Jury sent me away.

275
00:16:28,572 --> 00:16:30,407
<i>One day, these men show up,</i>

276
00:16:31,325 --> 00:16:33,369
tell me they're gonna fix my arm.

277
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:35,913
Not only fix it, make it better.

278
00:16:38,374 --> 00:16:40,918
Instead, they turned me into the monster
who everybody thought I was.

279
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,756
Did my father know what was going on
at Pinewood Farms?

280
00:16:45,923 --> 00:16:47,257
No. No.

281
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:51,261
When he found out what was going on,

282
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:55,307
<i>when he saw what they were doing to us,
he shut it down.</i>

283
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,434
Paid to put us into hiding.

284
00:16:59,103 --> 00:17:00,729
So how many were there of you?

285
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:04,233
I'm not sure. I know
most didn't survive the experiments.

286
00:17:06,694 --> 00:17:08,487
It started up again, didn't it?

287
00:17:10,114 --> 00:17:12,408
<i>That's why my father came to see you
after all those years.</i>

288
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:17,955
He wasn't sure, but he had his suspicions.
He came to warn me.

289
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:22,668
Whoever was running Pinewood,

290
00:17:23,836 --> 00:17:26,505
whoever started it up again,
I know that's who killed my parents.

291
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:28,340
<i>Do you remember any names?</i>

292
00:17:29,133 --> 00:17:30,843
None of them ever used their names
around us,

293
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:33,637
but the man who was in charge,

294
00:17:34,638 --> 00:17:38,976
I can still see his face
every time I close my eyes.

295
00:17:40,811 --> 00:17:42,104
Then you need to take us there.

296
00:17:43,981 --> 00:17:46,608
You need to take us to Pinewood Farms.

297
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:51,905
My father risked his life to save you.

298
00:17:54,825 --> 00:17:56,660
I'm asking you to repay that favor.

299
00:17:59,204 --> 00:18:03,417
I promise, nothing will happen to you.

300
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:09,089
Okay.

301
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:11,800
Yeah, it didn't go quite to plan,

302
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:13,343
but whatever.

303
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,804
I look incredible in that wedding dress.

304
00:18:16,722 --> 00:18:18,140
I just bet you did.

305
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:21,935
And how did you get out of Arkham?

306
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:24,938
Well, that was easy,
with a lot of...

307
00:18:25,397 --> 00:18:29,443
"Oh, my God, I can't
believe I killed all these people."

308
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:33,197
Boo-hoo.

309
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:35,824
Well, what's your plan now?

310
00:18:36,325 --> 00:18:40,537
Well, I'm thinking about
getting into the assassination business.

311
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:42,498
Only I need a partner.

312
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,210
What do you have to offer?

313
00:18:47,336 --> 00:18:49,630
I'm rich, fabulous,

314
00:18:49,797 --> 00:18:54,343
and, in your case, I may have
just the thing to restore your reputation.

315
00:18:55,886 --> 00:18:56,929
Really?

316
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:01,725
<i>All right, see you next week.</i>

317
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:03,685
Let me help you with that.

318
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:06,146
Thanks.

319
00:19:20,369 --> 00:19:22,079
Stubborn.

320
00:19:25,249 --> 00:19:26,416
I need to speak to the Lady.

321
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:27,751
She's expecting you.

322
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:30,671
Hey, Jim. Guess what.

323
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:32,798
You were right.

324
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:41,723
Wow.

325
00:19:41,974 --> 00:19:44,393
Is anyone getting major déjà vu here?

326
00:19:45,644 --> 00:19:51,608
Only wait, oh, we're missing Lee. Shame.
That would've been a real family reunion.

327
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:53,610
So that's what this has been about?

328
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:54,862
Delivering me to her?

329
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:57,072
<i>Well, when I saw her picture
in your file,</i>

330
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:59,449
I figured you'd go after her,
so I did some digging.

331
00:19:59,992 --> 00:20:03,787
Saw you two had some history,
and it all kind of came together.

332
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:06,331
So did I deliver or what?

333
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,041
When you said he was looking for me,

334
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:11,962
I assumed this had something to do
with the men I sent to kill him?

335
00:20:12,296 --> 00:20:17,301
No, he knows you contracted
Matches Malone for the Wayne murders,

336
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:22,848
and he is just obsessed with finding out
who hired you. It's like his thing.

337
00:20:23,015 --> 00:20:24,558
That's why he's here?

338
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:30,480
I have absolutely no idea
who is behind the Wayne murders.

339
00:20:31,023 --> 00:20:32,274
You didn't take the contract?

340
00:20:32,441 --> 00:20:35,152
Oh, no, I mean I did,
but we did it all over the telephone.

341
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:36,445
<i>I never met the client.</i>

342
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:38,071
Well, you must have got a name.

343
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,908
- He went by a nickname.
- Oh...

344
00:20:42,618 --> 00:20:43,827
Poor Jim.

345
00:20:45,162 --> 00:20:46,914
So close.

346
00:20:47,623 --> 00:20:49,708
It's almost sad you have to die.

347
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:54,838
Oh.
You know, should we just tell him?

348
00:20:55,213 --> 00:20:57,674
You always this sentimental?

349
00:20:58,133 --> 00:21:02,888
Fine. He called himself the Philosopher.

350
00:21:03,931 --> 00:21:07,434
Here you go, Jim. Now you know.

351
00:21:13,565 --> 00:21:14,816
Told you I had a plan.

352
00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:24,743
It doesn't exactly scream, "top secret
bioengineering lab," does it?

353
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:26,745
This is it.

354
00:21:28,538 --> 00:21:31,375
All right, you two sit tight.
I'll have a shifty.

355
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:36,713
Honestly.

356
00:21:39,883 --> 00:21:42,761
She's here. Right.

357
00:22:24,052 --> 00:22:26,555
I'd wager nothing's been touched in here
for a decade.

358
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:39,401
Are you okay?

359
00:22:41,945 --> 00:22:46,324
Seeing all this,
it feels like yesterday that I was here.

360
00:22:48,869 --> 00:22:52,622
I'm sorry.
Uh, it looks like your father was wrong.

361
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:54,833
Maybe it's for the best.

362
00:22:56,084 --> 00:22:57,335
You can move on now.

363
00:22:59,713 --> 00:23:01,798
You knew this place was shut down,
didn't you?

364
00:23:02,924 --> 00:23:04,676
Is that why you brought me here,
hoping I'd give up?

365
00:23:04,843 --> 00:23:05,844
Steady on, Master Bruce.

366
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:08,138
No, she's hiding something.
I can see it in her eyes.

367
00:23:09,222 --> 00:23:11,558
I don't understand.
What won't you tell me?

368
00:23:12,684 --> 00:23:13,685
Hey!

369
00:23:14,144 --> 00:23:16,480
Hey, this is private property.
I'm gonna call the cops.

370
00:23:17,522 --> 00:23:19,316
The girl comes with us,
and no one gets hurt.

371
00:23:19,983 --> 00:23:21,276
Run, Master Bruce.

372
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:23,361
Run!

373
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:52,808
Come on.

374
00:24:04,528 --> 00:24:05,862
Drop the gun! Now!

375
00:24:24,589 --> 00:24:26,758
You go down Fourth,
and I'll look this way.

376
00:24:27,342 --> 00:24:28,593
Got it.

377
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,346
What the hell was that about?

378
00:24:31,888 --> 00:24:32,889
Don't be mad.

379
00:24:33,056 --> 00:24:36,017
I was tied to a chair
and nearly killed, again.

380
00:24:36,226 --> 00:24:37,227
What should I be feeling?

381
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:38,603
Gratitude?

382
00:24:39,604 --> 00:24:40,981
I'm not feeling that.

383
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:44,901
I needed the Lady to trust me.
It's called a plan.

384
00:24:45,068 --> 00:24:47,529
- "A plan"? What if I'd stayed outside?
- Mmm.

385
00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:49,030
Really?

386
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:53,034
Look, we got the name.
We should be celebrating.

387
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:55,495
Hey, we kind of make a pretty good team.

388
00:24:55,829 --> 00:24:57,122
This doesn't change anything.

389
00:24:58,081 --> 00:25:01,293
I got you the information
that I said I would.

390
00:25:01,918 --> 00:25:05,755
Everything I did in there, I did for you.
You have to see that.

391
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:08,592
Honestly, I don't know what I see.

392
00:25:09,593 --> 00:25:10,635
Then look.

393
00:25:13,138 --> 00:25:14,139
Please.

394
00:25:17,726 --> 00:25:18,810
What do you care?

395
00:25:19,227 --> 00:25:21,271
After everything that's happened.
Let's say you've changed.

396
00:25:21,563 --> 00:25:22,898
What do you care what I think?

397
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:26,943
Because when I woke up from that coma,

398
00:25:28,195 --> 00:25:30,530
the first image I saw was your face

399
00:25:30,864 --> 00:25:33,116
as you were holding onto me
from the church window.

400
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:35,660
You were trying to save me.

401
00:25:36,912 --> 00:25:39,581
Because in that moment,
you didn't see the monster.

402
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:42,792
You just saw me.

403
00:25:44,502 --> 00:25:45,837
That's what I've been holding on to.

404
00:25:49,174 --> 00:25:52,302
Because I feel like, if you
could just look at me like that again,

405
00:25:54,554 --> 00:25:55,555
I'd be okay.

406
00:25:58,975 --> 00:25:59,976
I'd make it.

407
00:26:02,896 --> 00:26:04,147
You wanna be a better person?

408
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,191
Yes.

409
00:26:07,442 --> 00:26:08,860
It's your choice to make.

410
00:26:10,028 --> 00:26:11,404
I can't be that for you.

411
00:26:12,697 --> 00:26:13,865
You tried to kill Lee.

412
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:17,827
I can't forgive that.

413
00:26:19,496 --> 00:26:20,664
I won't.

414
00:26:31,508 --> 00:26:32,509
Just get it.

415
00:26:33,843 --> 00:26:35,637
Bruce.

416
00:26:36,388 --> 00:26:39,015
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down. Slow-- Slow--

417
00:26:45,105 --> 00:26:46,189
I'll be right there.

418
00:26:59,244 --> 00:27:00,287
Alfred!

419
00:27:03,123 --> 00:27:04,207
About bloody time, mate.

420
00:27:04,374 --> 00:27:05,625
Not my call, pal, how about you

421
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:06,835
stop getting arrested so much?

422
00:27:07,002 --> 00:27:09,004
- Where's Bruce?
- In with Barnes.

423
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:10,171
<i>Bullock!</i>

424
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,257
Prep Karen Jennings to travel.

425
00:27:12,424 --> 00:27:14,801
I want her at Blackgate today. No contact.

426
00:27:14,968 --> 00:27:16,886
You! You're free to go.

427
00:27:17,178 --> 00:27:19,931
I suggest you do so
before I change my mind.

428
00:27:22,017 --> 00:27:23,059
What did you tell him?

429
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:26,730
The truth. He didn't seem to like it.

430
00:27:28,648 --> 00:27:30,233
All right. How about you tell me?

431
00:27:33,403 --> 00:27:35,947
Your father found out
about this program,

432
00:27:36,114 --> 00:27:39,284
where Karen Jennings was a subject,
and shut it down.

433
00:27:39,451 --> 00:27:43,204
When it was restarted, he tried
to stop it, and they had him killed.

434
00:27:43,371 --> 00:27:45,415
And you think Karen can identify
the men involved?

435
00:27:45,665 --> 00:27:48,918
Doesn't know their names.
Says she can remember the faces.

436
00:27:53,465 --> 00:27:56,259
The man who contracted Matches Malone
to kill your parents

437
00:27:57,344 --> 00:27:58,845
called himself the Philosopher.

438
00:28:00,472 --> 00:28:02,223
Hold on. How do you know this?

439
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:05,143
I've been conducting my own investigation.
I found out today.

440
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:08,772
And I'd be willing to bet that this
is the man who is behind Pinewood.

441
00:28:11,941 --> 00:28:13,068
What do we do?

442
00:28:18,656 --> 00:28:21,326
Have Lucius Fox put together
the files of all the scientists

443
00:28:21,493 --> 00:28:24,037
who've worked for Wayne Enterprises
over the past 15 years.

444
00:28:24,204 --> 00:28:27,374
If Karen can pick this man out,
if he is the Philosopher,

445
00:28:27,957 --> 00:28:29,250
we can tie him to your parents' murder.

446
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:32,670
Well, that's assuming, of course,
that Karen Jennings is still alive.

447
00:28:33,797 --> 00:28:36,466
I mean, it's obvious
these guys mean business.

448
00:28:37,217 --> 00:28:39,469
She's gonna be dead
the minute she hits Blackgate Prison.

449
00:28:41,721 --> 00:28:43,181
That's why we're gonna break her out.

450
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:47,560
How much money
can you put together quickly?

451
00:28:49,646 --> 00:28:50,897
How much do you need?

452
00:29:04,994 --> 00:29:07,997
Patient 44's EEG patterns
confirm paradoxical sleep.

453
00:29:08,164 --> 00:29:11,668
We're getting close.
He's getting close.

454
00:29:12,502 --> 00:29:16,714
Karen Jennings was arrested
and is being sent to Blackgate Prison.

455
00:29:17,841 --> 00:29:18,842
Pity.

456
00:29:19,676 --> 00:29:22,053
It seems we should abandon our efforts
to bring her back.

457
00:29:23,638 --> 00:29:25,432
She cannot be allowed to talk.

458
00:29:25,598 --> 00:29:26,641
I'll send a team.

459
00:29:26,808 --> 00:29:29,269
Actually, I was thinking this would be
the perfect opportunity

460
00:29:29,436 --> 00:29:32,147
to let our sub-zero guest
try out his new suit.

461
00:29:33,314 --> 00:29:34,315
You sure?

462
00:29:35,316 --> 00:29:38,570
Whatever that gas did to him,
he's not the man he was before.

463
00:29:38,736 --> 00:29:41,114
He seems very angry.

464
00:29:42,031 --> 00:29:44,033
Oh, I know.

465
00:29:49,164 --> 00:29:50,331
I was listening to that.

466
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,959
Hello, Victor. How are you feeling?

467
00:29:54,085 --> 00:29:55,128
<i>How am I feeling?</i>

468
00:29:57,005 --> 00:29:58,715
I'm locked in a freezer.
How do you think I'm feeling?

469
00:29:59,591 --> 00:30:01,134
That's why I'm here.

470
00:30:01,801 --> 00:30:06,389
How would you like to go
on a little field trip?

471
00:30:40,381 --> 00:30:41,508
What the hell?

472
00:30:59,943 --> 00:31:01,110
Damn.

473
00:31:37,897 --> 00:31:40,066
Yo, Marty, you're never gonna believe it.

474
00:31:41,317 --> 00:31:43,278
You have a decision to make.

475
00:31:44,153 --> 00:31:46,489
You can keep the money, toss us your gun,

476
00:31:46,656 --> 00:31:48,616
and tell your supervisor
you were disarmed,

477
00:31:48,783 --> 00:31:51,119
or be a hero
and wake up like your friend here

478
00:31:51,286 --> 00:31:53,329
with nothing to show for it
but a massive headache.

479
00:31:53,496 --> 00:31:55,665
I'd say it's a bit of
a no-brainer, wouldn't you, sweetheart?

480
00:31:56,499 --> 00:31:57,667
Give me your tool.

481
00:31:59,168 --> 00:32:00,461
You can go.

482
00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:07,176
Go ahead.

483
00:32:10,471 --> 00:32:13,016
Enjoy your cash. Let's go!

484
00:32:28,197 --> 00:32:30,199
Bruce, what is going on?
Who is this?

485
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:31,492
A friend.

486
00:32:31,993 --> 00:32:33,202
Nice to meet you.

487
00:32:33,369 --> 00:32:34,871
He's gonna help us get you out of town.

488
00:32:35,371 --> 00:32:38,541
I have a car, cash, and a new identity
waiting for you back at Wayne Manor.

489
00:32:40,418 --> 00:32:42,045
I can't believe you would do this for me.

490
00:32:42,378 --> 00:32:45,048
I made a promise
nothing would happen to you.

491
00:32:45,965 --> 00:32:47,216
I intend to keep it.

492
00:32:47,634 --> 00:32:49,135
Karen, do you know a man

493
00:32:49,302 --> 00:32:51,387
who goes by the nickname
"the Philosopher"?

494
00:32:51,721 --> 00:32:54,182
That's, uh, the man who ran the program.

495
00:32:55,058 --> 00:32:58,186
That's what the others called him,
something about some game they played.

496
00:32:58,728 --> 00:33:00,063
And you can identify him?

497
00:33:00,229 --> 00:33:01,397
- Yeah.
- Good.

498
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:04,567
We have someone tracking down the files
of all the scientists

499
00:33:04,734 --> 00:33:06,527
<i>who've worked for Wayne Enterprises
over the years.</i>

500
00:33:06,694 --> 00:33:08,279
<i>After that, you can disappear.</i>

501
00:33:08,446 --> 00:33:10,239
No one will ever hurt you again.

502
00:33:12,575 --> 00:33:14,077
You sound just like him.

503
00:33:17,163 --> 00:33:19,165
I have been hiding something
from you, Bruce.

504
00:33:21,876 --> 00:33:24,379
Your father did more
than just rescue me from Pinewood.

505
00:33:25,088 --> 00:33:26,255
What do you mean?

506
00:33:26,422 --> 00:33:32,011
After what happened, I was so angry,
but he never gave up on me.

507
00:33:33,012 --> 00:33:35,598
<i>He kept visiting, gave me books to read,</i>

508
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:38,559
a music box for my birthday.

509
00:33:39,727 --> 00:33:41,729
He kept reminding me that I wasn't alone,

510
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:44,315
that I wasn't a monster.

511
00:33:46,109 --> 00:33:50,071
I never knew what a real father should be
until Thomas Wayne.

512
00:33:51,906 --> 00:33:54,117
That's why
I didn't want you to pursue this.

513
00:33:55,368 --> 00:33:57,078
I didn't want you to see him differently.

514
00:33:58,788 --> 00:34:00,873
Your father started Pinewood, Bruce.

515
00:34:02,166 --> 00:34:03,626
<i>His intentions were good,</i>

516
00:34:04,711 --> 00:34:07,088
<i>but the man in charge
took advantage of him.</i>

517
00:34:07,755 --> 00:34:10,675
He didn't realize the truth
until it was too late.

518
00:34:12,468 --> 00:34:16,639
Pinewood was his burden,
but it doesn't have to be yours.

519
00:34:18,641 --> 00:34:20,143
It's not a burden.

520
00:34:25,022 --> 00:34:26,232
It's who I am.

521
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:33,406
Hold on!

522
00:34:54,135 --> 00:34:55,386
Victor?

523
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:57,430
You.

524
00:35:00,516 --> 00:35:01,684
Put down the gun!

525
00:35:11,027 --> 00:35:12,069
Go! Get on Bruce!

526
00:35:13,613 --> 00:35:15,239
You both all right? You all right?

527
00:35:18,034 --> 00:35:20,703
Go! Go. Run. It's me he's after.

528
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:22,288
We're not leaving without you.

529
00:35:24,499 --> 00:35:26,501
I'm so glad I met you, Bruce.

530
00:35:27,126 --> 00:35:31,255
Your dad would be so proud of you,
of the man that you've become.

531
00:35:37,595 --> 00:35:39,305
- Hey, Karen!
- Stay here!

532
00:35:51,234 --> 00:35:55,571
No! No! No!

533
00:35:55,738 --> 00:35:57,073
Get back! Get back!

534
00:36:18,469 --> 00:36:19,470
Sorry I'm late.

535
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,848
I did get you
that salt water taffy you like, so--

536
00:36:22,014 --> 00:36:23,140
Shh.

537
00:36:23,474 --> 00:36:24,600
You'll wake her.

538
00:36:26,435 --> 00:36:29,105
I thought she was in Arkham, in a coma.

539
00:36:29,897 --> 00:36:30,898
Not anymore.

540
00:36:32,108 --> 00:36:35,987
She showed up
a couple of hours ago, poor thing.

541
00:36:36,612 --> 00:36:38,614
What is she doing here?

542
00:36:39,574 --> 00:36:40,825
She's come home.

543
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:50,334
Huh.

544
00:36:59,594 --> 00:37:01,846
My father risked his life to protect her.

545
00:37:04,307 --> 00:37:07,685
He cared for her, and now she's dead

546
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,026
Because of me.

547
00:37:17,528 --> 00:37:19,113
Not because of you, Master Bruce.

548
00:37:20,907 --> 00:37:22,199
Because of what you're pursuing.

549
00:37:23,659 --> 00:37:25,077
Is there a difference?

550
00:37:27,788 --> 00:37:28,789
Yes.

551
00:37:30,791 --> 00:37:33,669
And if you can't make your peace
with that, then you're not ready.

552
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:38,674
There will be others, Master Bruce.

553
00:37:43,971 --> 00:37:46,557
Karen was the only one who knew
what the Philosopher looked like.

554
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,730
How are we going to find him now?

555
00:38:04,825 --> 00:38:06,327
You need to have faith, Bruce.

556
00:38:08,245 --> 00:38:09,789
I know what you risked today.

557
00:38:12,375 --> 00:38:14,377
- If Barnes finds out you were involved--
- He will,

558
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:17,922
if he hasn't already.

559
00:38:18,506 --> 00:38:21,008
Pretty sure my days at the GCPD are over,

560
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,094
but I knew that going in.

561
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:25,972
Then why'd you do it?

562
00:38:26,931 --> 00:38:28,599
You're not the only one
who made a promise.

563
00:38:32,728 --> 00:38:34,772
- Oh, Mr. Fox.
- I let myself in.

564
00:38:36,065 --> 00:38:38,067
I think I might have something.

565
00:38:39,402 --> 00:38:42,571
When I was compiling
the personnel files on scientists,

566
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:46,325
I also ran a cross-reference search
on Pinewood Farms and the Philosopher,

567
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:48,119
and found this.

568
00:38:48,494 --> 00:38:51,205
It's from a company newsletter
taken 12 years ago.

569
00:38:52,081 --> 00:38:54,375
The photo lists team nicknames.

570
00:38:54,583 --> 00:38:56,002
<i>Look at the man next to your father.</i>

571
00:39:00,381 --> 00:39:03,634
"Hugo Strange, the Philosopher."

572
00:39:06,095 --> 00:39:07,430
He runs Arkham now.

573
00:39:10,516 --> 00:39:11,517
A friend.

574
00:39:14,437 --> 00:39:16,230
Someone he trusted.

575
00:39:19,316 --> 00:39:21,068
That's not fair.

576
00:39:25,072 --> 00:39:26,449
That's not right.

577
00:39:36,667 --> 00:39:39,295
Oh, Karen, what a shame.

578
00:39:40,212 --> 00:39:41,922
You held such promise.

579
00:39:43,507 --> 00:39:47,011
Victor said he recognized Jim Gordon,
said he was with a boy.

580
00:39:48,471 --> 00:39:49,472
Bruce Wayne.

581
00:39:50,473 --> 00:39:53,851
So he and Jim Gordon are working together.
Well, well.

582
00:39:54,602 --> 00:39:59,148
I think life is about to get
very interesting for us, Ms. Peabody.

583
00:40:00,816 --> 00:40:02,777
It's coming from downstairs.

584
00:40:04,028 --> 00:40:05,321
Patient 44.

585
00:40:05,613 --> 00:40:07,615
But the reanimation
should take another 12 hours.

586
00:40:10,076 --> 00:40:12,078
- Grab him. Grab him.
- Stop!

587
00:40:30,888 --> 00:40:33,015
Oh, Peabody, we did it.

588
00:40:35,059 --> 00:40:36,977
We brought someone back.

589
00:40:37,686 --> 00:40:40,189
We actually did it.

590
00:40:42,108 --> 00:40:43,234
<i>What? What is it now, Sister?</i>

591
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,527
What's he saying?

592
00:40:46,779 --> 00:40:48,572
<i>Heathen dogs, huh?</i>

593
00:40:50,449 --> 00:40:51,867
What now, Sister?

594
00:40:52,576 --> 00:40:56,205
Oh, the holy city. Oh, I see.

595
00:40:56,539 --> 00:40:58,040
<i>The saint will deliver us.</i>

596
00:40:59,333 --> 00:41:03,295
No, don't leave. Don't leave.

597
00:41:03,546 --> 00:41:04,964
Should I gas him?

598
00:41:05,631 --> 00:41:07,174
<i>Azrael.</i>

599
00:41:10,219 --> 00:41:13,639
Azrael!

600
00:41:18,644 --> 00:41:20,104
Azrael.

601
00:42:07,484 --> 00:42:08,485
English - SDH
