1
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:21,970
Then let's play ice hockey!

2
00:01:24,929 --> 00:01:28,929
Inside Out 2

3
00:01:28,929 --> 00:01:32,971
You heard Joy there reporting
straight from Riley's mind-

4
00:01:32,971 --> 00:01:36,971
- and we're expecting a great
fight here today with the Fog Horns.

5
00:01:37,971 --> 00:01:42,929
Riley fans, get up from your
seats and make some noise!

6
00:01:42,971 --> 00:01:43,929
Come on!

7
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:45,929
Come on, Misty Horn!

8
00:01:47,971 --> 00:01:49,971
Get in with the paws!
Foghorn is number three.

9
00:01:49,971 --> 00:01:51,971
- One two three!
- Fog!

10
00:01:59,972 --> 00:02:04,972
And now it's time to
meet your Tim Riley!

11
00:02:04,972 --> 00:02:09,972
He is playing in his 13th year and will come
straight from the penalty box: Riley's Wrath!

12
00:02:09,972 --> 00:02:11,972
Let me skin him!

13
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:23,973
Helmet, visor, gloves.
Security check completed.

14
00:02:23,973 --> 00:02:25,973
Everything went smoothly from...

15
00:02:25,973 --> 00:02:26,973
Watch out!

16
00:02:28,973 --> 00:02:30,973
It was Fear, which
kept Riley alert.

17
00:02:30,973 --> 00:02:32,973
We need mouth guards, people.

18
00:02:34,931 --> 00:02:37,973
No, no, no!  It's not ours!

19
00:02:37,973 --> 00:02:41,973
And that's the famous Disgust.
Great, we have him on the team.

20
00:02:43,974 --> 00:02:47,932
- 28, Anderson.  Leg span.
- Oh no.

21
00:02:47,974 --> 00:02:50,974
And the raisins at the end of
the sausage, you know and love him-

22
00:02:50,974 --> 00:02:53,974
- incomparable...

23
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:55,974
We got an expulsion.

24
00:02:55,974 --> 00:02:58,974
Appropriate!  It's
sad to be home!

25
00:02:58,974 --> 00:02:59,974
Yay.

26
00:03:00,974 --> 00:03:03,974
Andersen got two minutes
in the leg span box.

27
00:03:03,974 --> 00:03:07,933
We have a few minutes,
as Riley sighs.

28
00:03:07,933 --> 00:03:11,975
I'll keep you posted.
Riley is still amazing.

29
00:03:12,975 --> 00:03:13,975
nice.

30
00:03:13,975 --> 00:03:17,975
Not just because he's the
best in class, and he is.

31
00:03:17,975 --> 00:03:19,975
Riley, look here!

32
00:03:19,975 --> 00:03:25,934
He is also very sweet and
caring for street cats.  Frankly!

33
00:03:25,934 --> 00:03:30,975
And now he is officially a teenager.
He got very tall very quickly.

34
00:03:30,975 --> 00:03:35,976
- Have we grown overnight?
- That's our favorite blouse.

35
00:03:35,976 --> 00:03:38,976
We even got braces
with elastics!

36
00:03:38,976 --> 00:03:40,976
- How does it feel?
- Cold!

37
00:03:40,976 --> 00:03:41,976
Excuse me.

38
00:03:41,976 --> 00:03:45,976
Riley's Island of
Personality is in full force.

39
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:48,976
Although Boybandøen
was destroyed.

40
00:03:48,976 --> 00:03:50,976
But Fjolleøen is
still causing problems.

41
00:03:51,976 --> 00:03:54,976
- Wait, where is Family Island?
- There.

42
00:03:55,977 --> 00:03:57,935
Yes, that's him.

43
00:03:57,977 --> 00:04:02,977
- What's looming over him?
- Friendship Island.  Isn't that beautiful?

44
00:04:02,977 --> 00:04:06,977
But we've discovered that he's a
memory of not just the lowly island.

45
00:04:06,977 --> 00:04:12,936
Getting to the roots
memories also create value.

46
00:04:12,936 --> 00:04:14,936
Homework should be banned.

47
00:04:15,977 --> 00:04:18,977
Rise and Shine is the
best band in the world!

48
00:04:18,977 --> 00:04:22,978
- And my personal favorite...
- I'm a very good friend.

49
00:04:22,978 --> 00:04:27,978
Did you know that the coins on
your sofa can change the world?

50
00:04:31,978 --> 00:04:36,978
- We have to do something.
- NO.  The girl is a social Titanic.

51
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:38,978
Friends...

52
00:04:41,978 --> 00:04:43,979
How beautiful it is.

53
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:50,979
Everything is alright.  I
lose too all the time something.

54
00:04:53,979 --> 00:04:56,979
- My name is Riley.
- My name is Grace.

55
00:04:57,979 --> 00:04:59,979
My name is Bree.

56
00:05:00,979 --> 00:05:05,938
When you put all the values ​​together,
they create something beautiful.

57
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:07,980
Self-Conception.

58
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:12,980
- I am a good person.
- That makes Riley make a good choice.

59
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:18,980
13 years of hard work gathered into
what some would call our masterpiece.

60
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,980
Biggest challenge...

61
00:05:21,938 --> 00:05:24,980
- Geez!  We have to fight again.
- That's right.

62
00:05:25,022 --> 00:05:27,980
- How do we score goals?
- With our shots!

63
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:32,981
- No, we are rushing towards the goal!
- But Grace hasn't scored yet.

64
00:05:33,981 --> 00:05:35,939
Riley controls it.

65
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:40,981
We threaded the needle!

66
00:05:41,981 --> 00:05:42,981
Come on, Riley.

67
00:06:08,982 --> 00:06:11,982
Like that!  Did you see
that?  That's my daughter!

68
00:06:12,941 --> 00:06:15,024
The foghorns win
the championship!

69
00:06:20,983 --> 00:06:22,983
He shoots, he scores!

70
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:25,983
Hello girls.
Congratulations on the win.

71
00:06:25,983 --> 00:06:29,941
- That's the coach from high school!
- What a match!

72
00:06:29,941 --> 00:06:33,983
The final attack there? The
three of you are very impressive.

73
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,983
Thank you, Coach Roberts.

74
00:06:34,983 --> 00:06:39,983
I'm late, but whatever the
year I had a three day camp.

75
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:43,983
I invite the area's best
players.  You have to come along.

76
00:06:43,983 --> 00:06:47,984
Are we dreaming right now?
Pin me right in the arm.

77
00:06:48,984 --> 00:06:49,984
I'm clearly awake.

78
00:06:49,984 --> 00:06:52,984
If we impress him, the three of
us will be on the team next year.

79
00:06:52,984 --> 00:06:56,984
Fire Eagle!  Finally a team
that I support wholeheartedly.

80
00:06:57,984 --> 00:06:59,984
- What did you say?
- Yes!

81
00:07:00,943 --> 00:07:03,984
- We'll be there.
- Big.  Well then, I'll see you tomorrow.

82
00:07:04,026 --> 00:07:05,984
Too wild!

83
00:07:10,985 --> 00:07:12,985
A fun day!

84
00:07:12,985 --> 00:07:16,943
After all, you are a star.  You
get a trainer to slide backwards.

85
00:07:16,943 --> 00:07:21,985
- You got an ice hockey scholarship!
- Dad, stop.  It's just training camp.

86
00:07:21,985 --> 00:07:23,985
Who knows what happened?

87
00:07:26,985 --> 00:07:29,985
28, Anderson.  Leg span.

88
00:07:29,985 --> 00:07:32,944
My expulsion had almost
cost us our victory.

89
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:35,986
- What if I peek at the camp?
- Do not say that.

90
00:07:35,986 --> 00:07:39,986
- You did well today.
- Appropriate.  Mom understands.

91
00:07:40,986 --> 00:07:43,986
- Looks like I did.
- We are very proud of you.

92
00:07:43,986 --> 00:07:45,986
Good night, monkey.

93
00:07:45,986 --> 00:07:48,986
Yes yes.  Sleep well, darling.

94
00:07:54,986 --> 00:07:59,987
- Riley is very hard on herself.
- But we can make things easier.

95
00:08:00,987 --> 00:08:04,987
I present my super high
technology Riley protection system.

96
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:07,987
You don't see it.

97
00:08:08,945 --> 00:08:13,987
Here's to all the memories he has in
the back of his head like a penalty box.

98
00:08:13,987 --> 00:08:16,987
It was a burden on him,
so we lightened the burden.

99
00:08:16,987 --> 00:08:21,946
One-way express route to... “We don't
want to think about that right now.”

100
00:08:24,946 --> 00:08:26,946
- Not bad!
- Amazing.

101
00:08:26,946 --> 00:08:30,988
- You take good care of Riley.
- Thank You.  I do my best.

102
00:08:30,988 --> 00:08:32,988
Now we look for the memories.

103
00:08:32,988 --> 00:08:36,988
Here he is waving at a guy who is
actually waving at the girl in the back.

104
00:08:37,988 --> 00:08:39,988
Its bad.  Good choice.

105
00:08:39,988 --> 00:08:42,947
- Here she forgot her maiden name.
- Pretty awkward.

106
00:08:42,988 --> 00:08:44,989
- So what's his name?
- Janet maybe?

107
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,989
It doesn't matter.  Go with him.

108
00:08:47,989 --> 00:08:50,989
We keep the best and
discard the worst.

109
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:55,989
Good work.  Anger, the rest
smokes in Long Term Memory.

110
00:09:02,989 --> 00:09:06,989
Okay.  Let's eat sleep.
Tomorrow's the big day.

111
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:17,990
Joy, take it down there,
I think, you do too?

112
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,990
- Do you want to come this time?
- Yes.  I mean no.

113
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:23,990
Oh no.  This may
not be very good.

114
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:26,990
Everyone has experienced
this in their value system.

115
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:30,990
But this is new.  And I
know how important it is.

116
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:35,991
I don't want to damage anything
or burn it to the ground.

117
00:09:35,991 --> 00:09:39,991
You won't destroy anything.
Have I ever misled you?

118
00:09:39,991 --> 00:09:42,991
- Yes.  Often.
- Come on.

119
00:09:44,991 --> 00:09:46,991
Where I go go, you go.

120
00:10:11,992 --> 00:10:13,992
Geez.

121
00:10:45,994 --> 00:10:49,994
- Mom and dad are proud of me.
- One of the good old ones.

122
00:10:51,994 --> 00:10:55,952
- I'm kind.
- That's good.

123
00:10:57,994 --> 00:11:01,994
I am strong.  I am brave.
I am a very good friend.

124
00:11:17,995 --> 00:11:19,995
I'm a winner.

125
00:11:19,995 --> 00:11:24,995
Together, everyone created
this cherish our Riley.

126
00:11:24,995 --> 00:11:26,954
I am a good person.

127
00:11:51,996 --> 00:11:53,996
What the hell is that?

128
00:12:07,997 --> 00:12:09,997
PUBERTY

129
00:12:14,997 --> 00:12:18,956
- Turn it off, Joy!
- The earth is sinking!

130
00:12:18,997 --> 00:12:21,039
NO!  What are you doing now?

131
00:12:34,956 --> 00:12:36,998
- Problem solved.
- Joy...

132
00:12:41,998 --> 00:12:45,999
OK, we'll clean the
dent. It's demolition day!

133
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:52,957
- Demolition?  What is going on?
- What is going on?

134
00:12:55,999 --> 00:12:56,999
Who are you?

135
00:13:00,999 --> 00:13:02,999
Do you support this?

136
00:13:02,999 --> 00:13:03,999
SORRY FOR THE FUCK
PUBERTIS IS SOMETHING CRAZY

137
00:13:03,999 --> 00:13:05,999
Are you good for not
tearing Headquarters down?

138
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:11,000
- There isn't anything.  The permit has just been completed.
- What for?

139
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
For expansion, there
is room for others.

140
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
- What about the other?
- Are they there yet?

141
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
- Margie, do you have the console?
- Yes yes, wait a minute.

142
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
- What are you doing now?
- Then he's ready.

143
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,042
Now you have to wake up,
Riley.  You're going camping.

144
00:13:28,042 --> 00:13:33,001
- Lunch break!
- Wait!  You can't escape the chaos.

145
00:13:33,001 --> 00:13:37,001
- We will back.
- Come on.  We're going to be late.

146
00:13:40,001 --> 00:13:42,001
Riley, aren't you packing yet?

147
00:13:44,043 --> 00:13:49,001
You always chase me!  So
leave me alone for one second!

148
00:13:49,001 --> 00:13:52,001
- Are we overreacting a little?
- I barely touched it.

149
00:13:52,001 --> 00:13:56,001
- Flat pan destroys the console.
- What is wrong?

150
00:13:56,001 --> 00:14:00,002
- Mom looks sad.
- I'm the worst person in the world!

151
00:14:00,002 --> 00:14:03,043
- No, then.  Darling.
- I barely touched it.

152
00:14:04,002 --> 00:14:05,002
What did I say?

153
00:14:09,002 --> 00:14:11,002
Let a professional come to you.

154
00:14:13,002 --> 00:14:18,002
I'm too stupid to go
camping or go outside anymore!

155
00:14:18,002 --> 00:14:19,044
Yes, it's clearly broken.

156
00:14:21,003 --> 00:14:25,003
- We prepared for today.
- We agreed to take it easy.

157
00:14:25,003 --> 00:14:28,003
- But he smells.
- Very large!

158
00:14:28,003 --> 00:14:31,003
Stay calm.  Wait with
the agreed script.

159
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:35,045
You're not stupid,
darling. You just change.

160
00:14:36,003 --> 00:14:39,003
Do you remember that beautiful
one? butterflies in the garden?

161
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:43,003
- It used to be a caterpillar.
- Alert.

162
00:14:43,003 --> 00:14:45,004
- Alert.
-... by getting wings.

163
00:14:45,004 --> 00:14:48,004
- If you have any questions...
- Mom!  Just go!

164
00:14:49,962 --> 00:14:53,004
A small preview of
the next ten years.

165
00:14:53,712 --> 00:14:55,712
- Riley!
- This will be so fun!

166
00:14:56,712 --> 00:14:59,712
Who's ready for ice hockey camp?

167
00:14:59,712 --> 00:15:03,713
Until we fix the problem, no one
is allowed to touch the console.

168
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:07,754
So what should we
do this weekend?

169
00:15:07,754 --> 00:15:11,713
We can finally get it
to clean the garage or...

170
00:15:11,713 --> 00:15:17,713
How cool will next year be?
Roberts' team just won every year.

171
00:15:17,713 --> 00:15:20,713
And Val Ortiz is
their leader now.

172
00:15:20,713 --> 00:15:23,755
Valentina Ortiz's
obsession is out of control.

173
00:15:24,714 --> 00:15:28,714
- He joined the team as a freshman.
- This is very difficult.

174
00:15:28,714 --> 00:15:35,714
We just have to play really well in
camp, then we'll all be Flamehawks!

175
00:15:35,714 --> 00:15:38,714
What's that?  We have one
glance.  I do not like it.

176
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:42,714
- You're paranoid.
- I never miss a glance.

177
00:15:44,756 --> 00:15:48,715
Zoom in 15 to 33. Slightly
to the right.  Zoom in.

178
00:15:48,715 --> 00:15:50,715
There!

179
00:15:50,715 --> 00:15:54,715
- And?
- He's hiding something.  But what?

180
00:15:56,715 --> 00:15:59,715
- What is he doing?
- He looked into our eyes!

181
00:15:59,715 --> 00:16:02,715
No, not just that.

182
00:16:04,715 --> 00:16:07,715
- I can't see anything new.
- Compare.

183
00:16:07,715 --> 00:16:11,715
Look at yourself.
Riley before, Riley now.

184
00:16:11,715 --> 00:16:14,716
- It is clear!
- But what does that mean?

185
00:16:14,757 --> 00:16:16,757
He knows we're hiding something.

186
00:16:18,716 --> 00:16:20,716
- What happened?
- I do not know!

187
00:16:21,716 --> 00:16:24,716
- I can not take it anymore!
- You spit!

188
00:16:25,716 --> 00:16:28,675
Roberts will not remain
our coach next year.

189
00:16:30,758 --> 00:16:33,716
We have found one
second high school.

190
00:16:35,716 --> 00:16:36,717
Oh no.

191
00:16:37,717 --> 00:16:41,717
Okay.  Good.

192
00:16:41,717 --> 00:16:45,717
- This is not very good!
- Seriously?  How long have they known?

193
00:16:45,717 --> 00:16:48,759
We can't move on to high
school without Bree and Grace.

194
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:50,717
We can still go for a walk.

195
00:16:50,717 --> 00:16:54,717
And we have the weekend, so we're coming along
for the last time we can play as a team together.

196
00:16:55,717 --> 00:16:57,717
Friends forever, right?

197
00:16:57,717 --> 00:16:59,717
Yes.  Of course.

198
00:17:01,676 --> 00:17:06,718
- I can't wait to get on the ice.
- When will we get the program?

199
00:17:06,718 --> 00:17:07,759
This is very sad.

200
00:17:08,718 --> 00:17:11,718
- Do not be sad!
- No.

201
00:17:11,718 --> 00:17:13,718
Wait while driving.

202
00:17:14,718 --> 00:17:18,677
So here we are.  Here
it looks pretty cool.

203
00:17:18,718 --> 00:17:21,718
And you don't lack a single
assistant coach?  I have time.

204
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,719
NO?  See you later,
in a few days.

205
00:17:24,719 --> 00:17:28,719
- You shouldn't miss us too much.
- Riley, do you have everything now?

206
00:17:28,719 --> 00:17:30,719
- Staff?  Gloves?
- Yes.

207
00:17:30,719 --> 00:17:34,719
- Is your phone charged?
- Yes, it's 50%.  That's fine.

208
00:17:35,677 --> 00:17:37,761
Call if anything
comes up.  I love you.

209
00:17:37,761 --> 00:17:40,719
- Okay.  I love you.
- Don't forget deodorant.

210
00:17:40,719 --> 00:17:42,761
- Mother!
- Hey, hey, monkey.

211
00:17:44,719 --> 00:17:47,719
Okay, now.

212
00:17:52,678 --> 00:17:54,761
It doesn't matter.  We need it.

213
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,720
That's a high school student!  We will
not stand there with red and swollen eyes.

214
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,720
Don't worry, we have plenty of
time to think about it after camp.

215
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,762
Where did Bree and Grace go?

216
00:18:12,721 --> 00:18:15,721
- They're there.
- Aren't those traitors already dead to us?

217
00:18:15,721 --> 00:18:17,721
Our best friend?  NO.

218
00:18:21,721 --> 00:18:23,721
Are you okay?

219
00:18:23,721 --> 00:18:25,721
Behave normally! This
is Valentina Ortiz.

220
00:18:25,721 --> 00:18:26,721
We have to say something.

221
00:18:28,763 --> 00:18:30,721
- Hello.
- Hello.  My name is Val.

222
00:18:30,763 --> 00:18:34,721
Yes, you were the captain and broke records
as a junior.  Your favorite color is red...

223
00:18:35,721 --> 00:18:37,722
- What do we say?
- We're not cool.

224
00:18:37,722 --> 00:18:41,722
- Why are we holding his hand?
- Like me.

225
00:18:41,722 --> 00:18:45,722
Coach has told us about it
you. Riley's from Michigan, right?

226
00:18:45,722 --> 00:18:49,722
- Minnesota, sweet.
- We can't fix Val Ortiz.

227
00:18:50,722 --> 00:18:54,722
Yes, it's me.  Riley
goes good old Michigan.

228
00:18:55,722 --> 00:18:58,722
- Who makes orange consoles?
- I haven't touched it.

229
00:18:58,722 --> 00:19:00,764
- Orange is not my color.
- Not me.

230
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:02,764
Hi everybody.

231
00:19:03,723 --> 00:19:09,723
I'm your big fan.  And
now I stand opposite you.

232
00:19:09,723 --> 00:19:11,723
How can I help?

233
00:19:11,723 --> 00:19:15,723
I can take notes, drink coffee,
manage your calendar, watch you sleep.

234
00:19:15,723 --> 00:19:20,723
You may have wild energy! Maybe
you could just stay in one place.

235
00:19:20,723 --> 00:19:22,765
Whatever.  I AM
always here for you.

236
00:19:23,723 --> 00:19:27,724
- Love it.  What's your name?
- Oops, I forgot that.

237
00:19:27,724 --> 00:19:29,724
I'm Anxious.  One of
Riley's new Feelings.

238
00:19:29,724 --> 00:19:33,766
We're proud to be Here.
Where do I put my things?

239
00:19:33,766 --> 00:19:38,724
- What do you mean by "we"?
- Only I am as tall as you.

240
00:19:38,724 --> 00:19:41,724
- Who are you?
- I envy.

241
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:45,724
- Wow!  Good hair.
- Forget it.

242
00:19:46,724 --> 00:19:49,725
Look at his hair!  we
should have hair like that.

243
00:19:49,725 --> 00:19:53,766
I like the red
color in your hair.

244
00:19:53,766 --> 00:19:55,725
What are you doing now?

245
00:19:55,725 --> 00:20:00,725
When I join the team, may I
also color it completely red.

246
00:20:03,725 --> 00:20:07,725
- What kind of man is that?
- What is your name, big bun?

247
00:20:07,725 --> 00:20:11,767
That's Flove.  He doesn't like
eye contact and doesn't talk much.

248
00:20:12,726 --> 00:20:13,726
But he is very funny.

249
00:20:13,726 --> 00:20:16,726
Welcome to Headquarters, Flove.

250
00:20:16,726 --> 00:20:18,726
Yes, we are making... No.

251
00:20:18,726 --> 00:20:20,726
Not high.

252
00:20:20,726 --> 00:20:22,726
Your palms are quite sweaty.

253
00:20:23,768 --> 00:20:26,768
Should we be followed?  Then
you can meet some Flamehawks.

254
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:30,726
Very interesting!  But
we shouldn't show him that.

255
00:20:31,726 --> 00:20:32,726
Yes, quite good.

256
00:20:32,726 --> 00:20:35,726
- What is that feeling?
- That's Ennui.

257
00:20:35,726 --> 00:20:36,727
Wh-what?

258
00:20:37,727 --> 00:20:40,768
Ennui.  That's all, you
will be called boredom.

259
00:20:41,727 --> 00:20:43,768
Come here, An-way!

260
00:20:43,768 --> 00:20:45,727
Did I say that right?

261
00:20:45,727 --> 00:20:48,727
An-waa?  NO.  Nickname!
I just call you Oui-Oui.

262
00:20:48,727 --> 00:20:49,727
NO.

263
00:20:50,727 --> 00:20:53,727
- How do you control it?
- By application.

264
00:20:53,727 --> 00:20:55,727
Stop it!  Now that's enough.

265
00:20:55,727 --> 00:21:00,728
The new feeling can at
first seem very rarely used

266
00:21:00,728 --> 00:21:04,728
- and you just want to say to
them: "Why are you so annoying?"

267
00:21:05,728 --> 00:21:09,728
But I've learned that everyone's
emotions are good for Riley.

268
00:21:09,728 --> 00:21:13,770
- Even this lump.
- OK, good enough.

269
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:18,728
- Cold.  Previously.
- Take your things and follow me.

270
00:21:18,728 --> 00:21:21,728
- What about our friends?
- Elections are our future.

271
00:21:21,728 --> 00:21:26,729
So agreed.  We should make new friends,
so we won't be alone in high school.

272
00:21:26,729 --> 00:21:28,729
- Not really, Joy?
- Possible...

273
00:21:29,729 --> 00:21:32,729
Wait.  Thank you for
showing me around.

274
00:21:32,729 --> 00:21:34,771
- Why did you do that?
- Excuse me.  What am I doing?

275
00:21:34,771 --> 00:21:39,729
- We left our best friend.
- But we have to go out and meet new people.

276
00:21:39,729 --> 00:21:42,729
The next three days should
be about Bree and Grace.

277
00:21:42,729 --> 00:21:47,771
The next three days can decide
the next four years of our lives.

278
00:21:47,771 --> 00:21:49,771
That's too much.

279
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:53,730
- Joy is really old fashioned.
- What?

280
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:56,730
You make Riley happy.
Sad makes him sad.

281
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:59,730
Fear protects against that
scary thing, he can see-

282
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:05,730
- and I protect from scary
things, he can't see.  I think ahead.

283
00:22:05,772 --> 00:22:07,730
Now you just have to see it.

284
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:11,730
I use it as a cup holder.

285
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:16,731
My team has processed all the data.
We estimate the following scenario:

286
00:22:16,731 --> 00:22:19,731
If we're just messing
around with Bree and Grace-

287
00:22:19,731 --> 00:22:22,731
- not that Riley is
cool in Val's eyes.

288
00:22:22,731 --> 00:22:26,731
He didn't impress the coaches, wouldn't survive
the Flamehawks and then come to high school-

289
00:22:26,773 --> 00:22:31,731
- where he was alone, eating alone,
and only the teacher knew his name.

290
00:22:31,731 --> 00:22:35,731
- The two of us will become good friends.
- This is a sad story.

291
00:22:35,731 --> 00:22:40,732
This is an amazing story.  Love
your energy, but you're way out.

292
00:22:40,732 --> 00:22:44,732
- None of this will happen.
- If you say so.

293
00:22:44,732 --> 00:22:48,732
Do you remember when we all
finally made it to Headquarters?

294
00:22:48,732 --> 00:22:53,774
– It's been 30 seconds, Nostalgia.
- Yes, that was the time.

295
00:22:53,774 --> 00:22:55,774
Nostalgia, you must not
have reached here yet.

296
00:22:56,732 --> 00:23:02,733
You have ten years to come, two graduations
and a wedding.  I have to speak up.

297
00:23:02,733 --> 00:23:06,733
Focus!  Val leads us
into the sacred halls.

298
00:23:06,733 --> 00:23:08,733
Here he is!

299
00:23:10,775 --> 00:23:13,775
The girls are so cool!

300
00:23:13,775 --> 00:23:16,733
And older.  We dress not
about being in front of them.

301
00:23:16,733 --> 00:23:19,733
In the dressing room
there is mutual respect.

302
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:22,733
- You should meet the other Flamehawks.
- Keep going?

303
00:23:23,733 --> 00:23:25,734
- Hello.
- Riley is from Michigan.

304
00:23:25,734 --> 00:23:29,775
- OK, we'll keep it that way.
- Where are you from in Michigan?

305
00:23:30,775 --> 00:23:33,734
- What now?
- Then we have to ride it until it runs out.

306
00:23:33,734 --> 00:23:36,734
- Michigan cities...
- We have to think of something.

307
00:23:36,734 --> 00:23:40,734
- A little here and there.
- Good.  See you on the ice.

308
00:23:40,734 --> 00:23:43,776
- Do you want to sit with us?
- He wants to sit with us!

309
00:23:44,734 --> 00:23:45,776
Everything is beautiful!

310
00:23:45,776 --> 00:23:49,735
What about Bree and
Blessing?  We sat there.

311
00:23:49,776 --> 00:23:53,735
I will make room for that
my friends.  Thank You.

312
00:23:54,735 --> 00:23:58,735
- Yes alright.  Okay.
- It wasn't that difficult then.

313
00:23:58,735 --> 00:24:02,735
No, that decision will be taken later,
don't bother us for the rest of our lives.

314
00:24:02,735 --> 00:24:04,777
- It is a lie!
- Bree and Grace!

315
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:06,735
There he is!

316
00:24:06,735 --> 00:24:09,735
Then it's time to cheer!

317
00:24:09,735 --> 00:24:10,735
Say...

318
00:24:11,735 --> 00:24:13,736
Well done, ladies.  Fall.

319
00:24:17,777 --> 00:24:18,777
Joy?

320
00:24:19,736 --> 00:24:20,778
- Wait! Wait!
- Miss!

321
00:24:20,778 --> 00:24:24,736
“Fall” means “fall to
rest." You have to listen.

322
00:24:24,736 --> 00:24:27,736
So now I need your
cell phone.  All of them.

323
00:24:30,736 --> 00:24:35,778
You are here to work, not to play
around.  Are you there, Andersen?

324
00:24:37,737 --> 00:24:38,737
Yes, coach.

325
00:24:38,737 --> 00:24:42,737
Put your phone in the box.
You'll get it again after camp.

326
00:24:44,737 --> 00:24:47,737
His coach took it
quite seriously.

327
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:51,779
- Maybe I can help...?
- No, thank you.  Not now.

328
00:24:51,779 --> 00:24:52,779
Yes, right?

329
00:24:55,737 --> 00:24:57,737
Do you think this is funny?

330
00:24:57,737 --> 00:25:01,738
You know what's also fun? Penalty
round.  Get on the ice, ladies!

331
00:25:01,738 --> 00:25:04,738
- Well done, Michigan.
- Thank you very much, new girl.

332
00:25:06,738 --> 00:25:10,780
- Good job, Joy.  Now he fits clearly.
- Thank you, Oui-Oui.

333
00:25:14,738 --> 00:25:19,738
- You are behind, Andersen!  Faster!
- This is the most disappointing.

334
00:25:19,738 --> 00:25:24,780
Well done, ladies.  That's small
breathing room.  And then we formed a team.

335
00:25:30,739 --> 00:25:34,739
- His Michigan girls got off to a bad start.
- Are they talking about us?

336
00:25:34,739 --> 00:25:38,739
He won't make the team, if
he doesn't control himself.

337
00:25:38,739 --> 00:25:41,781
As if you were in control of
everything in the first year?

338
00:25:41,781 --> 00:25:47,739
- I'm not very mature.
- You put a straw in your nose.

339
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:52,740
Now I have to do it, big bun.

340
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:59,740
I always dream of those people talking
about us.  But it's not like that.

341
00:25:59,782 --> 00:26:01,740
Joy, what do we do now?

342
00:26:02,782 --> 00:26:06,740
- We can just...
- I have an idea.

343
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:10,740
If we complete our side's
Val, everything will go well.

344
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:17,741
- Election?
- Hey, Riley.  What is it?

345
00:26:20,741 --> 00:26:23,741
Excuse me.  I will not give
penalty rounds to the whole team.

346
00:26:23,741 --> 00:26:27,741
I feel bad.  I appreciate you
and will never ruin it for you.

347
00:26:28,741 --> 00:26:32,741
- You apply it a little thickly.
- You are just an excellent captain...

348
00:26:32,783 --> 00:26:35,741
- I really admire you.
- OK, OK.  Thank You.

349
00:26:35,741 --> 00:26:41,742
Coach was tough on you today, but
that just means you're on his radar.

350
00:26:41,742 --> 00:26:44,742
- Do?
- Good, you come and talk to me.

351
00:26:44,742 --> 00:26:47,784
- We should try to get into the same team.
- Cold.

352
00:26:47,784 --> 00:26:50,784
Wow.  Only I can do that.

353
00:26:50,784 --> 00:26:54,742
Nothing special. I
just want to help.

354
00:26:54,742 --> 00:26:58,742
Agree.  So that's great, Angst.

355
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:03,784
I step back, you step in and get Riley
on the right track.  Now I'm active again.

356
00:27:03,784 --> 00:27:06,784
- That's just the first part of the plan.
- Is there a second part?

357
00:27:06,784 --> 00:27:08,785
A good plan has several parts.

358
00:27:09,743 --> 00:27:11,785
Now we form teams
for the rest of camp.

359
00:27:12,743 --> 00:27:16,743
Split yourself down the middle.  Team
one to the right, hold two to the left.

360
00:27:16,743 --> 00:27:20,785
- Now we do it!
- Again in the same team.

361
00:27:22,743 --> 00:27:25,744
- Val wants us!
- But we made a promise to Bree and Grace.

362
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:27,785
We have to think ahead.

363
00:27:29,744 --> 00:27:34,744
Come on, Riley, move your feet. Val
is on team one, step aside.  Come on.

364
00:27:34,744 --> 00:27:37,786
He gave his friends a
lift.  He wouldn't break it.

365
00:27:37,786 --> 00:27:39,744
You're right, Joy.

366
00:27:40,786 --> 00:27:42,744
What are you doing now?

367
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:46,744
NO!  You shouldn't
take that.  Put it again.

368
00:27:48,745 --> 00:27:52,745
Not to hold it against
me, but it has to go.

369
00:28:01,745 --> 00:28:05,745
- NO.
- Change is scary, but look here.

370
00:28:07,745 --> 00:28:09,745
I look forward to it.

371
00:28:10,787 --> 00:28:13,746
Welcome to the team, Michigan.

372
00:28:19,746 --> 00:28:22,746
- That's not Riley.
- This is a better Riley.

373
00:28:22,746 --> 00:28:25,746
Riley won't be alone next year.

374
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:29,788
We build a new self-concept
on him.  The new Riley.

375
00:28:29,788 --> 00:28:31,788
NO!  You shouldn't take
it down there with him.

376
00:28:32,746 --> 00:28:34,746
It will be mine
dead, a burnt corpse!

377
00:28:35,788 --> 00:28:39,747
I am so sorry.  I am looking
forward to this collaboration.

378
00:28:39,747 --> 00:28:44,789
- What are you doing now?
- Riley's life is more complicated now.

379
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:49,747
This requires more sophisticated
emotions. He no longer needs you, Joy.

380
00:28:50,747 --> 00:28:54,747
- How dare you?!
- You can't just lock us up like that.

381
00:28:54,747 --> 00:28:55,747
Great idea!

382
00:28:57,747 --> 00:28:58,747
I can't breathe!

383
00:28:59,747 --> 00:29:03,789
It's not forever.  Only until
Riley would be 18, or maybe forever.

384
00:29:03,789 --> 00:29:07,748
- We will see.  See you!
- Afraid!  Riley needs us!

385
00:29:08,748 --> 00:29:11,748
Don't worry, Riley.
You are in good hands.

386
00:29:11,748 --> 00:29:14,748
Now we change
everything about you.

387
00:29:23,748 --> 00:29:28,749
Quick question.  How to build
us a new Riley, cool concept-

388
00:29:28,749 --> 00:29:31,749
- if it took 13 years
to build the old one?

389
00:29:32,749 --> 00:29:35,749
The good news is that we
are not starting from scratch.

390
00:29:35,791 --> 00:29:38,749
- I want to plant it too!
- Next time.

391
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:48,749
If I'm a Flamehawk,
I'm not alone.

392
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:57,792
No, no, no.

393
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:01,750
- So set us free!
- Stop!  Shut us up!

394
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:04,750
Oh, joy...

395
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:08,792
BOX

396
00:30:11,792 --> 00:30:16,751
We'll be like that here forever!

397
00:30:20,751 --> 00:30:23,793
- Where are you taking us?
- Know Riley's secret.

398
00:30:23,793 --> 00:30:26,751
- We're not a secret.
- Yes yes.

399
00:30:26,793 --> 00:30:30,751
- "This is a big misunderstanding."
- We've never heard of it before.

400
00:30:33,751 --> 00:30:36,751
We are suppressed emotions!

401
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:41,793
- Shut us up!  Now!
- No, Riley will probably handle it.  Overall.

402
00:30:41,793 --> 00:30:47,752
Hello.  Do you know what we call
that? Denial.  Can you say "denial"?

403
00:30:47,794 --> 00:30:48,794
Hello friends.

404
00:30:49,752 --> 00:30:53,752
WELCOME.  How wonderful it is
to have you here with us today.

405
00:30:53,752 --> 00:30:57,794
- It's Blubber!
- Of that show Riley watched when he was four?

406
00:30:57,794 --> 00:31:00,794
Appropriate.  And
here's a little secret.

407
00:31:02,753 --> 00:31:04,753
Riley can still be
like the program.

408
00:31:05,753 --> 00:31:07,753
step like an
elephant, travel like a

409
00:31:07,753 --> 00:31:09,753
mouse, let's quickly
get to Blubber's house

410
00:31:10,753 --> 00:31:11,753
Kill me.

411
00:31:11,753 --> 00:31:15,795
The bubble that covered US.
Can you help us get out of here?

412
00:31:16,795 --> 00:31:20,753
We will need your
help. Can you free them?

413
00:31:21,753 --> 00:31:23,753
- Who are you talking to?
- My friends.

414
00:31:23,753 --> 00:31:25,754
Can you see the key?

415
00:31:28,754 --> 00:31:30,795
I can't do that either.

416
00:31:30,795 --> 00:31:32,795
- We're done.
- That far.

417
00:31:32,795 --> 00:31:35,796
Welcome to your eternal destiny.

418
00:31:35,796 --> 00:31:40,754
- Spear Sword?
- After all, he plays computer games.

419
00:31:40,754 --> 00:31:43,754
- What is she doing here?
- Riley is secretly in love with him.

420
00:31:43,754 --> 00:31:45,754
If I understand the reason.

421
00:31:45,754 --> 00:31:50,796
I long to be a hero, but
darkness haunts my past.

422
00:31:50,796 --> 00:31:52,796
I understand.

423
00:31:55,755 --> 00:31:59,755
- Who's this?
- It's Riley's Dark Secret.

424
00:31:59,755 --> 00:32:01,755
What's the secret?

425
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:03,797
You don't want to know that.

426
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:07,755
An anarchic feeling has
taken over Headquarters.

427
00:32:07,797 --> 00:32:11,755
- If you just opened the jar...
- Children, now we have to learn Latin.

428
00:32:11,755 --> 00:32:16,756
Know Iquid pro quo?  We'll get you
a jar, if you get us out of the box.

429
00:32:16,756 --> 00:32:20,797
No, Blubber.  We are
not masters of their fate.

430
00:32:20,797 --> 00:32:25,756
We were all thrown into this place and remain
thrown away because we don't belong, we're useless.

431
00:32:25,756 --> 00:32:29,756
You don't have to say that!  You
don't deserve to be kicked out.

432
00:32:29,756 --> 00:32:32,756
Wait a minute, Lance.  Remember
the so-called power moves.

433
00:32:32,756 --> 00:32:36,756
- Now I'm going to chase you, Riley!
- Well, so you think so?  Look here!

434
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:39,757
Frankly!

435
00:32:39,798 --> 00:32:43,757
Listen to me, Lance Slashblade.
No one is completely useless.

436
00:32:43,757 --> 00:32:46,757
But I am a warrior cursed
with a pheasant attack.

437
00:32:46,757 --> 00:32:49,757
Then make your own
curse on your gift.

438
00:32:51,757 --> 00:32:55,799
Protect yourselves, friends,
for I will set you all free!

439
00:33:00,757 --> 00:33:01,758
Can we get help?

440
00:33:04,758 --> 00:33:09,758
Well done, Dark Secret. Now
it's your turn to help us.

441
00:33:09,758 --> 00:33:15,800
My belt bag contains what we can
get out Say after me: "Oh, Bagesen!"

442
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,800
"Oh, the Wallet!"

443
00:33:21,758 --> 00:33:25,759
- Hi everybody.  I'm Taskesen.
- The bag, we want to escape.

444
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:28,800
- Do you have anything that can help us?
- I have a lot.

445
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:34,759
What do you think you can do that
is best used?  A tomato?  A frog?

446
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:37,759
- Or a stick of dynamite?
- You gods!

447
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:44,801
Hooray!  We did it!  Now sing
us all the song "We did it".

448
00:33:45,801 --> 00:33:48,801
- Continue!
- Thank you friends.  I might...

449
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,760
I have to leave you.

450
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,760
What About Dark Secrets?

451
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,760
Not yet.

452
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,802
That's probably
best for everyone.

453
00:34:00,802 --> 00:34:04,760
- Who let you out?  With you!
- What are we doing?

454
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:10,760
Oh, you're disgusting.  As you thought
of me, now I will believe in myself.

455
00:34:15,761 --> 00:34:17,802
What?

456
00:34:26,761 --> 00:34:27,761
What happened?

457
00:34:33,803 --> 00:34:35,803
- Dave, help!
- Wait a moment!

458
00:34:36,761 --> 00:34:37,762
Dave!

459
00:34:37,803 --> 00:34:38,803
MY HAT

460
00:34:39,762 --> 00:34:40,762
Spear!

461
00:34:40,762 --> 00:34:43,762
Goodbye friends.
Good afternoon, fate!

462
00:34:43,803 --> 00:34:46,762
There is one more lid for
each jar.  Already come!

463
00:34:48,554 --> 00:34:51,595
- What are we doing?
- Angry, stop it!  Where are you going?

464
00:34:52,595 --> 00:34:54,596
To Headquarters...
to help Riley!

465
00:34:54,596 --> 00:34:57,596
Riley wasn't up
there. He's out there.

466
00:34:57,596 --> 00:35:00,554
We can't go back
without his concept.

467
00:35:00,554 --> 00:35:06,554
How about we go to the
Back Head? Are you crazy?

468
00:35:06,554 --> 00:35:07,596
Enjoy how...

469
00:35:07,596 --> 00:35:09,596
Stop!  Nobody moves!

470
00:35:11,596 --> 00:35:14,555
Do you have a plan?

471
00:35:14,596 --> 00:35:19,555
- Angst probably has a really good plan.
- Of course I have a plan.

472
00:35:19,555 --> 00:35:23,555
He wasn't the only one there
thinking ahead.  First we just need…

473
00:35:25,597 --> 00:35:26,597
Give me a moment.

474
00:35:26,597 --> 00:35:29,555
We follow the Stream
of Consciousness.

475
00:35:29,555 --> 00:35:34,556
- Then we sail all the way to Baghovedet.
- Where are the bad memories.

476
00:35:34,556 --> 00:35:36,556
There we find that
Riley, we know and love.

477
00:35:37,556 --> 00:35:41,598
We put in space Self-Concept,
and Riley will be Riley again.

478
00:35:41,598 --> 00:35:44,598
– That plan could really work.
- Yes!

479
00:35:44,598 --> 00:35:48,598
And then I said to Angst:
“You shouldn't worry too much."

480
00:35:49,556 --> 00:35:52,556
And he would say, “I never
thought about it.  Thank You!"

481
00:35:52,556 --> 00:35:56,556
- Then we hugged and became friends.
- And I'll take it down.

482
00:35:56,556 --> 00:36:00,557
- Not angry.
- Good.  I didn't pry.

483
00:36:01,598 --> 00:36:05,599
Don't worry, I know how to power.
Triste and I have been here before.

484
00:36:06,557 --> 00:36:10,557
- Joy, this is a dead end.
- It's just the worst alley!

485
00:36:10,557 --> 00:36:14,599
Everything changed so fast.

486
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:18,557
- We're lost.
- If it's fun, you're not lost.

487
00:36:18,557 --> 00:36:22,599
- Nobody thought it was funny.
- Nonsense.  Look how much fun Triste is having.

488
00:36:24,558 --> 00:36:27,558
- I think you know the way.
- I am willing.  Moment.

489
00:36:27,558 --> 00:36:30,600
- He doesn't know the way.
- We're trapped here!

490
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,600
Riley was awake.

491
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:37,600
It's still too early.  What did they do
him with?  Come on, we'll find another way.

492
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,558
Don't worry, Riley.
We'll be there.

493
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:52,600
- Why do we get up so early?
- Because we have to speed up a little, mon ami.

494
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:56,559
So we're going to get on the ice early and
practice like we've never practiced before.

495
00:36:56,601 --> 00:36:59,559
- Aren't we fine?  - Yes.

496
00:36:59,559 --> 00:37:02,559
- But the Flamehawk is really good.
- Appropriate.

497
00:37:05,601 --> 00:37:10,560
Every time we miss, we take it
around.  Ice hockey is not a game.

498
00:37:21,602 --> 00:37:24,602
- Like!
- It was amazing.

499
00:37:24,602 --> 00:37:27,602
We have to be that good
all the time.  Again.

500
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:32,560
- I'm not the only one who likes to be fresh in the morning.
- It's Val!  We got the same idea.

501
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,561
We're almost the same.
We became good friends.

502
00:37:35,561 --> 00:37:38,602
- How long are you here?
- About an hour.

503
00:37:39,602 --> 00:37:42,603
- I want extra time on the ice.
- Me too.

504
00:37:42,603 --> 00:37:44,561
He understands us!

505
00:37:44,603 --> 00:37:49,561
I've told the others that you have to take
control of everything.  You know what it takes.

506
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:54,603
Check us out.
This went smoothly.

507
00:37:54,603 --> 00:37:58,603
- Yes.  But Val sure likes us a lot.
- Ask Val lots of questions.

508
00:37:59,562 --> 00:38:03,603
- People like to talk about themselves.
- How was your first year as a Flamehawk?

509
00:38:04,562 --> 00:38:08,562
So it's a tough job.
As in very difficult.

510
00:38:08,562 --> 00:38:12,604
- But I met my best friend.
- Val shares something with us!

511
00:38:12,604 --> 00:38:17,562
We were on a night out and
ordered takeout.  Come with me.

512
00:38:17,562 --> 00:38:20,562
Invitation exclusive.
We will go with you!

513
00:38:20,562 --> 00:38:23,563
- According to you?
- Of course.  Will be fun.

514
00:38:23,563 --> 00:38:25,563
Well done, ladies.
Then we warm up.

515
00:38:26,563 --> 00:38:28,604
- Hey, Riley.
- Hello.

516
00:38:29,605 --> 00:38:34,563
- We don't share Val with them.
- Morning makes me very hungry.

517
00:38:34,605 --> 00:38:37,605
- I'd die for a slice of pizza now.
- Yes!

518
00:38:38,563 --> 00:38:41,563
I said I know the way.
Stream of consciousness.

519
00:38:41,563 --> 00:38:44,605
- But...
- Wow, he's hungry!

520
00:38:44,605 --> 00:38:47,605
- Eat something delicious!
- Deep Pizza!

521
00:38:47,605 --> 00:38:50,564
- And it's still warm.
- With added cheese!

522
00:38:50,605 --> 00:38:55,564
- Sad, come on.
- Listen.  We couldn't take the tube home.

523
00:38:55,564 --> 00:39:00,564
- Only if they activate us with the console.
- We're stranded here.

524
00:39:00,564 --> 00:39:04,606
- Anxiety must be thinking about that.
- I doubt that.  Good.  Okay.

525
00:39:04,606 --> 00:39:09,565
Someone has to climb that
pipe, go home to Headquarters -

526
00:39:09,565 --> 00:39:11,565
- and take us back.

527
00:39:11,565 --> 00:39:13,565
- I did that.  I destroyed it...
- Zero.

528
00:39:14,565 --> 00:39:15,565
- Listen.
- Not you at all.

529
00:39:15,565 --> 00:39:19,607
- Thank You.
- Should I put a hose in it?

530
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:20,607
Forget it.

531
00:39:23,565 --> 00:39:27,607
- Oh no.  Not me.
- Yes, Sad!  You can.

532
00:39:28,565 --> 00:39:32,565
You're an expert on consoles.
You know the manual by heart.

533
00:39:32,565 --> 00:39:37,607
You say so, but I know a lot
less about manual 28, chapter 7-

534
00:39:37,607 --> 00:39:40,607
- "Remembering objects without
for memory" than people think.

535
00:39:41,566 --> 00:39:43,608
There you prove my
point.  Sounds like yes.

536
00:39:43,608 --> 00:39:49,566
- Where are you?  Are you taking a break now?
- Walkie talkie!  Here.  Can you hear me?

537
00:39:49,566 --> 00:39:53,608
Green light from Glæde.  Shift.
We'll signal when we get there.

538
00:39:53,608 --> 00:39:57,608
And then you got us back.  He's
the quickest way to Headquarters.

539
00:39:57,608 --> 00:40:01,567
I can't.  I'm not
strong like you.

540
00:40:01,567 --> 00:40:04,567
I know you, Sad.  You're strong.

541
00:40:04,567 --> 00:40:08,609
I don't have a specific
one for example, but you can.

542
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:15,567
- Don't look down.  Just crawl.
- Yes.  I can do that.

543
00:40:17,609 --> 00:40:21,568
- He can handle it.  No?
- 50% chance.

544
00:40:22,568 --> 00:40:23,568
Do you want one?

545
00:40:24,609 --> 00:40:27,609
We hate those bars. It
tastes like cardboard.

546
00:40:28,609 --> 00:40:31,610
- We can't say no to Val.
- You are absolutely right.

547
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:34,568
- We eat what Val eats.
- That's how it should sound.

548
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:38,568
Envy, you're in the zone.
Bear with me for a moment.

549
00:40:38,568 --> 00:40:43,610
- He chose me!  Did you see it, Ennui?
- You care too much about everything.

550
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:48,610
The texture is interesting.

551
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:53,569
It feels like... What
does that remind me of now?

552
00:40:54,569 --> 00:40:57,611
Cardboard box?
Asparagus?  Broccoli?

553
00:40:57,611 --> 00:41:01,611
- What did they do to him up there?
- Don't know.  But we have to go.

554
00:41:01,611 --> 00:41:04,611
- I didn't step...
- Yes.  Riley needs us.

555
00:41:05,569 --> 00:41:06,569
Okay!

556
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:12,570
Clumsy.  I thought
I was going to vomit.

557
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:28,570
If I'm good at ice
hockey, I make friends.

558
00:41:38,571 --> 00:41:40,571
- Good, Miss Riley.
- That's right, Michigan.

559
00:41:40,571 --> 00:41:44,571
You have practiced well
today.  Now relax tonight.

560
00:41:44,571 --> 00:41:49,613
Now comes the best!  Partying
with Val and our future lovers!

561
00:41:50,613 --> 00:41:52,613
Why do we stop here?

562
00:41:52,613 --> 00:41:55,613
There it is.  Red Notebook.

563
00:41:55,613 --> 00:41:59,572
- Now you scared him.
- Why does that scare me?

564
00:41:59,572 --> 00:42:04,613
All the coach's thoughts about you still
apply in that one.  The good and the bad.

565
00:42:04,613 --> 00:42:06,614
- Will you join the team.
- Or not.

566
00:42:07,614 --> 00:42:11,572
- That's too much.
- We only tell the truth.

567
00:42:11,572 --> 00:42:14,614
- What did he write about us?
- Do you think it's something bad?

568
00:42:14,614 --> 00:42:19,572
Not until now!  Imagine if we
weren't on the favorites list.

569
00:42:19,572 --> 00:42:22,614
Or we stand at the top
of the exercise list.

570
00:42:22,614 --> 00:42:26,614
Or worse: We don't stand on any
of the lists and are invisible!

571
00:42:26,614 --> 00:42:31,573
- Sorry, but they're leaving now.
- We lost them.

572
00:42:33,573 --> 00:42:37,615
A comfortable first night with
the group.  Be completely natural.

573
00:42:37,615 --> 00:42:41,615
- Why do we swing our arms like that?
- Keep your arms still.

574
00:42:41,615 --> 00:42:45,615
- It looks too crazy!
- Go as Dani.  The arms are rhythmic.

575
00:42:46,574 --> 00:42:51,574
- Now you are making things worse!
- Yes, sorry, actually I was trying something!

576
00:42:51,574 --> 00:42:55,616
- What do you think the pouch is for?
- Ennui, I'm proud of you.

577
00:42:57,616 --> 00:43:00,574
They laughed.  Does anyone know
what cool people are laughing at?

578
00:43:00,574 --> 00:43:03,574
We are busy with weapons.
Let's just say we get the joke.

579
00:43:10,575 --> 00:43:14,616
- Anger filled all the broccoli.
- Scared, what's wrong?

580
00:43:14,616 --> 00:43:18,617
- I'm not happy with this ship.
- When do we get there?

581
00:43:18,617 --> 00:43:22,575
- We were there when we were there.
- Anxiety will find out soon.

582
00:43:22,575 --> 00:43:24,575
He knows everything, right?

583
00:43:24,575 --> 00:43:26,575
I don't like his
words or actions.

584
00:43:27,617 --> 00:43:32,575
- But I think I can change it.
- Who likes banana cake?  Hands on!

585
00:43:35,617 --> 00:43:38,576
Well, Michigan, what
is your favorite band?

586
00:43:39,576 --> 00:43:42,576
Everyone looked at us.  There
is only one correct answer there.

587
00:43:44,618 --> 00:43:46,618
Rise and Shine!
They are too fat.

588
00:43:46,618 --> 00:43:50,576
I was just them completely
crazy in seventh grade.

589
00:43:50,618 --> 00:43:53,576
- Do you?
- I am a Glow Girly.

590
00:43:53,576 --> 00:43:56,576
NO!  That's definitely something
some of them think is cool.

591
00:43:57,577 --> 00:43:59,577
Remember everything
we know about music.

592
00:44:15,577 --> 00:44:17,619
We definitely know a cool song.

593
00:44:19,619 --> 00:44:21,619
- Fresh Tripelmint -
makes the smile white

594
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:25,578
Flove, get rid of it!  There
must be something here, somewhere.

595
00:44:25,578 --> 00:44:29,578
Something better, something
Cool.  No, not that one.

596
00:44:29,578 --> 00:44:33,578
We don't have anything better!
There are dad's jingles and soft rock.

597
00:44:33,578 --> 00:44:36,620
You still can't be like
Rise and Shine, right?

598
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:39,578
Do not panic.
What are we doing?

599
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:42,620
If we don't like their
music, we are nothing to them.

600
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:45,579
- We are considered as candidates.
- Excuse me.

601
00:44:45,579 --> 00:44:48,579
I've been waiting all
my life for this moment.

602
00:44:49,579 --> 00:44:52,620
Of course.  I love
Rise and Shine.

603
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:55,621
Love Rise and Shine.

604
00:45:01,579 --> 00:45:02,621
Avoid broccoli!

605
00:45:11,621 --> 00:45:13,621
- Joy!
- Reach out your hand.

606
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:18,580
- What's that?
- It's a Sarcasm Gap!

607
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:21,580
It can open several
kilometers!  Run for your life!

608
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:23,580
Sarcasm gap?  Seriously?

609
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:26,622
Rise and Shine is
my favorite band.

610
00:45:26,622 --> 00:45:29,622
He likes Bangun and Binar.  They
create their own choreography.

611
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:33,581
Joy if we don't follow the moment,
we don't know where we end up.

612
00:45:33,581 --> 00:45:36,581
And if we don't know,
we can't go with the flow!

613
00:45:36,581 --> 00:45:40,581
This is a vicious circle of
tragedy and its consequences!

614
00:45:40,581 --> 00:45:43,623
- We can also ask them there.
- We can do it too.

615
00:45:43,623 --> 00:45:46,623
How lucky we are
that we found you!

616
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:52,581
How lucky we are
that we met you.

617
00:45:53,581 --> 00:45:56,581
Come on!  We really
need your help!

618
00:45:56,581 --> 00:45:59,623
We really need your help.

619
00:45:59,623 --> 00:46:03,623
- What's their problem?
- You just need to increase the charm.

620
00:46:03,623 --> 00:46:08,582
Hello!  You are guaranteed to be the
coolest crane operator in the whole world!

621
00:46:08,624 --> 00:46:10,624
They're just some thugs.

622
00:46:12,582 --> 00:46:14,624
They're just some thugs.

623
00:46:14,624 --> 00:46:18,624
Rise and Shine is very cool.

624
00:46:18,624 --> 00:46:22,624
What are you talking about?
You do love Rise and Shine.

625
00:46:22,624 --> 00:46:24,583
Hello there.

626
00:46:24,583 --> 00:46:27,583
Why do we do best friends
hang out all the time?

627
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:30,583
We were just at a
concert with them.

628
00:46:30,583 --> 00:46:33,625
- Yes, yes, but...
- But what?

629
00:46:33,625 --> 00:46:36,583
- That was really fun.
- Grace, you're not helping.

630
00:46:36,625 --> 00:46:39,583
Oh yes, what a night indeed.

631
00:46:39,583 --> 00:46:40,625
Cool night.

632
00:46:42,625 --> 00:46:46,584
- Why don't they let him?
- What are we doing now?

633
00:46:46,584 --> 00:46:51,625
We took the longest and best
path.  Good for calf muscles, Vrede.

634
00:46:51,625 --> 00:46:53,626
Best night of my life.

635
00:46:54,584 --> 00:46:58,584
- Nice conversation.
- Very.  But we slipped.

636
00:46:58,626 --> 00:47:00,584
OK, hi.

637
00:47:00,584 --> 00:47:04,626
- This band is very good.
- Michigan has good taste.

638
00:47:06,626 --> 00:47:09,626
If we like the same things as
they do, we have enough friends.

639
00:47:09,626 --> 00:47:13,585
- Good night.
- Yes, I also want to sleep now.

640
00:47:13,626 --> 00:47:18,585
There are lots of hours.  And you should have
some sleep before tomorrow's practice game.

641
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:23,627
- We always have a practice match on the last day.
- This is how Val joined the team in his first year.

642
00:47:23,627 --> 00:47:28,585
Val scored two goals.  It was true
that no freshman had ever done it before.

643
00:47:28,627 --> 00:47:32,585
On paper, it's not a selection
until next year, but that's it.

644
00:47:32,627 --> 00:47:38,627
- You have to do well.  Be yourself.
- We can be Flamehawks tomorrow.

645
00:47:38,627 --> 00:47:41,628
How are we doing when
our new Self is not ready?

646
00:47:42,628 --> 00:47:46,586
You say something.  we have
to go down with these memories.

647
00:47:56,628 --> 00:47:58,628
Is that broccoli?

648
00:47:58,628 --> 00:48:02,587
- We'll go deeper.
- Well observed.

649
00:48:02,628 --> 00:48:06,587
The longest road is longer than
expected.  How about we sing for a while?

650
00:48:06,587 --> 00:48:10,587
- I know a song: "I surrender".
- We can also play silent games.

651
00:48:10,587 --> 00:48:11,629
One, two, three, calm down.

652
00:48:12,629 --> 00:48:16,629
- We went back and took him down...
- Get angry, not now.

653
00:48:16,629 --> 00:48:21,629
It didn't work.  The real Riley is
out there and we will never find him.

654
00:48:22,588 --> 00:48:24,588
I will find it.  I
just lack visibility.

655
00:48:39,588 --> 00:48:43,588
- OK, that won't work, fine enough.
- It's hopeless.

656
00:48:43,588 --> 00:48:48,630
- We have to drop it and come back.
- This is an increasingly blind road.

657
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:53,631
Since the puberty alarm went
off, nothing here has worked!

658
00:48:53,631 --> 00:48:58,589
I can no longer recognize the
place.  Sunny at one in the morning!

659
00:48:58,589 --> 00:49:01,631
Never in my life have
I done so many jars.

660
00:49:01,631 --> 00:49:03,631
The Riley we know is gone!

661
00:49:03,631 --> 00:49:07,631
If Joy can't see that,
then it's self-deception.

662
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:12,590
Self-deception?

663
00:49:12,590 --> 00:49:14,590
Of course it's
just self-delusion!

664
00:49:14,631 --> 00:49:21,632
It takes desperately to maintain optimism, when all
there is is mumbling, mumbling, mumbling from you!

665
00:49:21,632 --> 00:49:23,632
For seven sour Sørensen lemons!

666
00:49:24,632 --> 00:49:28,590
Do you think I have all
the answers? Of course not!

667
00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:33,591
We can't even find
it on our own Backhead.

668
00:49:37,632 --> 00:49:38,632
The fear is valid.

669
00:49:38,632 --> 00:49:43,633
Riley doesn't have much
need for us because he has it.

670
00:49:45,591 --> 00:49:49,591
And it hurts.  Really painful.

671
00:49:54,633 --> 00:49:58,592
The joy you have committed
to many mistakes.  Lots.

672
00:49:58,633 --> 00:50:01,633
And you will commit
even more in the future.

673
00:50:01,633 --> 00:50:06,592
But if you let mistakes stop you,
can we just lie down and give up.

674
00:50:06,592 --> 00:50:08,634
Sounds pretty good.

675
00:50:09,634 --> 00:50:10,634
Come on.

676
00:50:17,634 --> 00:50:20,634
- You can't use it!
- Riley Crisis.

677
00:50:20,634 --> 00:50:23,593
- Thank You.
- Get!

678
00:50:37,635 --> 00:50:40,593
- Forget it, it just happened.
- So agree.

679
00:50:45,635 --> 00:50:46,635
See.

680
00:50:50,594 --> 00:50:51,635
We are right behind you.

681
00:51:01,636 --> 00:51:03,636
Very good.  The flame
eagle has accepted us.

682
00:51:03,636 --> 00:51:06,636
But what's the point if
we don't make the team?

683
00:51:06,636 --> 00:51:10,595
- Tomorrow is very important.
- We have to get more help.

684
00:51:10,595 --> 00:51:12,595
- Ennui, are you listening?
- NO.

685
00:51:12,636 --> 00:51:15,636
- Embarrassed?
- Nice conversation.

686
00:51:15,636 --> 00:51:19,637
- Very.  But we slipped.
- OK, hi.

687
00:51:30,595 --> 00:51:33,637
What am I looking for?

688
00:51:33,637 --> 00:51:37,637
Don't you just hate it when you
forget what you were going to do?

689
00:51:37,637 --> 00:51:40,637
- We need all the help we can get.
- Agreed.

690
00:51:52,638 --> 00:51:54,638
This is our life the
most important game.

691
00:52:04,638 --> 00:52:07,639
Good friend.  It was
going to be a long night.

692
00:52:09,639 --> 00:52:11,639
Now we are preparing the team.

693
00:52:13,472 --> 00:52:14,472
Already come!  We just
need to go through…

694
00:52:14,472 --> 00:52:16,431
Fantasy world

695
00:52:16,431 --> 00:52:19,431
Fantasy world! INSIDE
would love this!

696
00:52:19,431 --> 00:52:22,473
There's Pomfritskoven
and Skyby and...

697
00:52:24,473 --> 00:52:26,473
There's definitely
something going on here.

698
00:52:27,473 --> 00:52:31,473
- Mount Crushmore?
- Are these the four people he likes the most?

699
00:52:31,473 --> 00:52:35,473
- Only Lance is important.
- At least that's the bright side.

700
00:52:36,431 --> 00:52:40,473
- All sides are good sides.
- The rumors?

701
00:52:40,473 --> 00:52:45,432
- The best gossip magazine.
- Latest news!  Hot gossip from Ryugtemøllen!

702
00:52:45,473 --> 00:52:50,432
- "There is a jacuzzi in the teacher's room"?
- "Lucy from the math team is a psychic"?

703
00:52:50,432 --> 00:52:54,474
"Abbie R texts Mike T, but
Mike T bakes cakes at Sarah M"?

704
00:52:54,474 --> 00:52:57,474
- Where are their ethics?
- Pudehyggeborg is still here!

705
00:52:57,474 --> 00:52:59,474
It even got bigger.

706
00:53:01,474 --> 00:53:02,474
And orange?

707
00:53:06,474 --> 00:53:10,433
22: Riley breaks his leg and
disappoints the entire team.  Very good.

708
00:53:11,475 --> 00:53:14,475
18: Val and Dani whisper together, as
Riley misses a goal-scoring opportunity.

709
00:53:14,475 --> 00:53:16,475
We have to help Riley
by getting ready.

710
00:53:17,475 --> 00:53:20,475
Now we ship everything
that can go wrong.

711
00:53:20,475 --> 00:53:25,433
We think ahead.  On everything
he might have done wrong.

712
00:53:25,475 --> 00:53:29,475
Come on, 17. I don't
see anything from you.

713
00:53:32,475 --> 00:53:35,476
Riley missed a scoring
opportunity. Coach took note.

714
00:53:35,476 --> 00:53:37,434
More than that!

715
00:53:37,476 --> 00:53:40,476
Oh no.  They use Riley's
Imagination against him.

716
00:53:40,476 --> 00:53:44,476
Val and the others like us now,
but what if we don't make the team?

717
00:53:48,476 --> 00:53:49,476
We go to number three.

718
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:52,476
Bree and Grace's team
won and we were laughed at.

719
00:53:52,476 --> 00:53:55,476
22. Val delivered
to us and we burned.

720
00:53:57,435 --> 00:54:01,477
He couldn't do that against
Riley!  We have to stop it.

721
00:54:02,477 --> 00:54:06,477
Beautiful, 37. Riley shoots
the puck in his own net.

722
00:54:06,477 --> 00:54:10,435
- Why did you draw a hippo?
- I'll draw Riley!

723
00:54:10,477 --> 00:54:13,435
- You forgot the ponytail.
- I like the ponytail.

724
00:54:14,436 --> 00:54:17,477
Riley scores a goal and everyone
hugs him?  81, that doesn't help.

725
00:54:17,519 --> 00:54:22,478
Riley's nail polish matches the game
jersey.  Everyone imitates his cool style.

726
00:54:22,478 --> 00:54:27,478
- Riley wears knee pads.
- We buy flowers for the losers.

727
00:54:27,478 --> 00:54:32,436
- What?  I can't always make a profit.
- I love it.

728
00:54:32,436 --> 00:54:36,478
Nail polish?  Knee pads? You
don't seem to understand the task.

729
00:54:36,478 --> 00:54:37,478
What...

730
00:54:41,478 --> 00:54:46,437
- Who sent that screenplay to Riley?
- How could I possibly know?

731
00:54:48,437 --> 00:54:52,479
What happened?  Who sent
all this positive stuff...

732
00:54:53,479 --> 00:54:56,479
Joy.  I know you are there.

733
00:54:56,479 --> 00:54:59,479
- Is that him?
- Joy from Headquarters?

734
00:55:00,437 --> 00:55:01,479
The police thought
they were on their way.

735
00:55:03,438 --> 00:55:06,438
- We tried it.
- Don't listen to Fear.

736
00:55:06,438 --> 00:55:09,479
He uses a bad scenario
to change Riley.

737
00:55:09,479 --> 00:55:13,480
I did it for you.  So
Riley could be happier.

738
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:18,438
If you want him to be happy,
will you stop torturing him.

739
00:55:18,438 --> 00:55:19,438
Who is with me?

740
00:55:22,438 --> 00:55:24,480
Seriously?  There isn't any?

741
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:28,480
- Sorry, Joy.
- Yes!  You're onto something, 87.

742
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:32,439
A cat.  Not very
clear, but good enough.

743
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:33,480
Who has anything?  Come on!

744
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:36,439
If Riley was better than
Val, Val would hate him.

745
00:55:36,481 --> 00:55:40,439
Or Riley is better than
Val, and Val respects him.

746
00:55:40,439 --> 00:55:41,481
Yes!  Like that!

747
00:55:42,481 --> 00:55:46,481
What if Riley is so bad he has to
stop playing ice hockey altogether?

748
00:55:46,481 --> 00:55:50,481
What if he plays, so his coach is
touched and he will go to the Olympics-

749
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:54,440
- and he achieved a home
victory to the joy of the nation?

750
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:56,440
Stay in the real
world for a moment.

751
00:55:57,523 --> 00:55:58,482
NO!

752
00:55:59,482 --> 00:56:03,482
Fear has chained you to the
table and made you draw nightmares!

753
00:56:03,482 --> 00:56:06,482
You don't need to do it
anymore find yourself in it!

754
00:56:06,482 --> 00:56:08,482
Put down the pencil!
Stop the scenario!

755
00:56:08,482 --> 00:56:11,440
- Hah!
- Now that's enough!

756
00:56:14,482 --> 00:56:16,482
- My scenario!
- Pillow fight!

757
00:56:19,482 --> 00:56:21,482
For Riley!

758
00:56:21,482 --> 00:56:23,483
We have to be prepared.

759
00:56:27,441 --> 00:56:28,441
NO!

760
00:56:30,483 --> 00:56:34,483
- OK, we should continue.
- Agreed.

761
00:56:34,483 --> 00:56:36,483
- Come on, bastard!
- NO.

762
00:56:40,483 --> 00:56:43,483
- Return!
- To the Possible Careers Parade!

763
00:56:47,484 --> 00:56:48,484
Grab a balloon!

764
00:56:48,484 --> 00:56:49,484
- Pastry chef!
- Underpaid!

765
00:56:49,484 --> 00:56:50,484
- Art teacher!
- Not appreciated!

766
00:56:51,484 --> 00:56:54,484
- Music ethnologist!
- Don't understand what it is.

767
00:56:54,484 --> 00:56:56,484
- Supreme Court Judge!
- Yes!

768
00:56:57,442 --> 00:56:59,442
Return!

769
00:56:59,442 --> 00:57:00,484
They escaped!

770
00:57:03,443 --> 00:57:06,484
Like!  Now Riley can sleep.

771
00:57:06,484 --> 00:57:08,484
I miss the jar!

772
00:57:08,484 --> 00:57:12,485
Joy doesn't understand.  Without a
scenario we are not prepared to face it.

773
00:57:12,485 --> 00:57:14,485
Tomorrow's match
is very important.

774
00:57:14,485 --> 00:57:19,443
Coaches turn us into Flamehawks
or condemn us to a lonely future.

775
00:57:19,443 --> 00:57:22,485
If only we knew what
the coach thought of us.

776
00:57:22,485 --> 00:57:25,485
- Notebook!
- Brilliant idea!

777
00:57:26,485 --> 00:57:27,485
It says all the coach's
thoughts about you.

778
00:57:29,485 --> 00:57:32,485
We snuck into his
office and read it.

779
00:57:36,444 --> 00:57:38,486
Come on, Riley.  Move your feet.

780
00:57:38,486 --> 00:57:41,486
- Is not it?
- Are we pushing it too hard?

781
00:57:41,486 --> 00:57:45,486
Read it visually in that notebook!
Then we know what we need to improve.

782
00:57:54,486 --> 00:57:56,486
Riley, no.

783
00:57:58,487 --> 00:58:00,487
Joy?  Come on in, Joy.

784
00:58:01,487 --> 00:58:05,487
Sad?  What is wrong? Why
did Riley wake up again?

785
00:58:05,487 --> 00:58:08,487
Anxiety causes Riley
to barge into the coach.

786
00:58:09,445 --> 00:58:13,487
- He knows better than that.
- Yes, when he regains his self-image.

787
00:58:13,487 --> 00:58:15,487
Sad, stop him.

788
00:58:15,487 --> 00:58:18,487
But don't stay trapped
in it.  Changed!

789
00:59:09,489 --> 00:59:11,448
No, Riley.

790
00:59:29,490 --> 00:59:31,449
Why did he stop?

791
00:59:31,449 --> 00:59:34,491
Sad?  Ennui! Where's
your cell phone?

792
00:59:34,491 --> 00:59:39,491
My cell phone?  Where's that?  Seriously!
This is not the case.  No, no, no!

793
00:59:40,491 --> 00:59:42,491
He must be here
somewhere.  Find him.

794
00:59:43,491 --> 00:59:44,491
That's it, I got you!

795
01:00:00,492 --> 01:00:02,492
Sad...

796
01:00:02,492 --> 01:00:04,450
NO.

797
01:00:05,492 --> 01:00:08,492
It felt wrong that
Riley was hanging around.

798
01:00:08,492 --> 01:00:10,492
Riley wasn't like that.

799
01:00:10,492 --> 01:00:15,492
It's not about who Riley
is, but who she will become.

800
01:00:28,493 --> 01:00:29,493
Andersen: NOT READY YET

801
01:00:30,493 --> 01:00:34,493
- "Not ready"?
- Has the choice been made?

802
01:00:34,493 --> 01:00:38,452
- Aren't we going to form a team?
- We have one more day.

803
01:00:38,452 --> 01:00:41,493
What we can do?
What will Val do?

804
01:00:41,493 --> 01:00:47,494
We have to make the coach change
his mind.  We need ideas.  Lots.

805
01:00:54,452 --> 01:00:57,494
Oh no.  This is brainstorming!

806
01:00:58,494 --> 01:00:59,494
Too close!

807
01:01:00,494 --> 01:01:03,494
Give you the puck?
Ruining another team?

808
01:01:07,494 --> 01:01:08,494
Yes!

809
01:01:10,495 --> 01:01:12,495
Bad ideas don't contact Riley.

810
01:01:14,495 --> 01:01:14,536
Joy!

811
01:01:16,495 --> 01:01:18,495
Destroy as many as possible!

812
01:01:20,495 --> 01:01:21,495
Joy!

813
01:01:27,495 --> 01:01:30,454
I caught the idea
I wish it was mine.

814
01:01:30,454 --> 01:01:34,496
NO!  None of them are
good enough!  Get more!

815
01:01:36,496 --> 01:01:37,496
Jump on the balloon!

816
01:01:42,496 --> 01:01:44,496
It's worse than broccoli!

817
01:01:48,496 --> 01:01:49,538
Take ideas!

818
01:01:52,496 --> 01:01:57,496
- The ideas are too small.
- We need bigger ideas.

819
01:02:01,497 --> 01:02:03,455
This is our salvation!

820
01:02:08,497 --> 01:02:10,497
Clear?

821
01:02:17,456 --> 01:02:19,456
We need this idea!

822
01:02:19,456 --> 01:02:21,539
If Riley takes it between
them, something is wrong!

823
01:02:22,498 --> 01:02:24,498
The only way out is up.

824
01:02:39,498 --> 01:02:40,498
That is a good idea!

825
01:02:41,498 --> 01:02:42,498
I like that one.

826
01:02:44,498 --> 01:02:45,498
Oh no.

827
01:02:49,499 --> 01:02:53,457
Hold me!  I mean!  Hold me!

828
01:02:54,541 --> 01:02:57,499
Scared, do you have a parachute?

829
01:02:57,499 --> 01:03:00,499
Yes, yes.  Why should
none of you be with him?

830
01:03:01,499 --> 01:03:05,499
- Solid ground!  And good landing.
- We did it!

831
01:03:05,499 --> 01:03:08,499
We did it!  Already come!
We're going to Baghovedet.

832
01:03:09,458 --> 01:03:11,500
You're done, Anxiety!

833
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:19,500
The coach was right.  Riley wasn't ready.
But we are very close to the new Riley.

834
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:25,500
We missed it here.  We showed
them that we are fearless Flamehawks.

835
01:03:37,501 --> 01:03:38,501
Cherry sports drink

836
01:03:47,501 --> 01:03:51,501
- Finally we are one of them!
- What do you think, Triste?

837
01:03:51,501 --> 01:03:52,501
- I...
- Cold!

838
01:03:52,501 --> 01:03:57,460
- Red is really our color.
- Very pleasant!

839
01:04:02,502 --> 01:04:05,502
OK, that creates
jealousy.  Excuse me.

840
01:04:05,502 --> 01:04:07,502
They think cool is temperature.

841
01:04:08,502 --> 01:04:12,502
Hey, Michigan.  You're the one
riding on the red wave, right?

842
01:04:13,460 --> 01:04:15,502
- We're coming in.
- I hope it's okay.

843
01:04:16,461 --> 01:04:20,502
I'm not a Flamehawk yet, but I just
want to match the rest of the team.

844
01:04:20,502 --> 01:04:25,503
- That's fine.  Did you sleep last night?
- No, not with today's big game!

845
01:04:25,503 --> 01:04:29,503
- Practice match?
- I said, you made him angry.

846
01:04:29,503 --> 01:04:31,503
You're in the zone, right?

847
01:04:31,503 --> 01:04:35,503
- Get ready to score.
- Overall!

848
01:04:35,503 --> 01:04:39,503
Val scored two goals in a practice match and
became a Flamehawk.  What's better than two?

849
01:04:40,503 --> 01:04:43,503
- Three!
- Three!  We said that at the same time.

850
01:04:43,503 --> 01:04:46,504
But how can we
score three goals?

851
01:04:46,504 --> 01:04:51,545
Riley just did it all.  And I think
this one is the icing on the cake.

852
01:04:55,504 --> 01:04:56,504
Moment.

853
01:05:00,962 --> 01:05:02,921
Come on!

854
01:05:02,921 --> 01:05:05,963
We are very close.
Self-concept above that bj...

855
01:05:10,963 --> 01:05:14,963
- There are some.
- I haven't sent back that much.

856
01:05:14,963 --> 01:05:19,963
- When he entered the glass doors at the party.
- And when he broke grandma's plate.

857
01:05:19,963 --> 01:05:23,922
Well, these memories
are not part of him.

858
01:05:37,964 --> 01:05:38,964
There it is!

859
01:05:44,964 --> 01:05:48,964
- I am a good person.
- Oh no.

860
01:05:59,007 --> 01:06:01,965
Yes.  Come on.

861
01:06:01,965 --> 01:06:03,965
Here he is!

862
01:06:04,965 --> 01:06:05,965
I'm not good enough.

863
01:06:07,965 --> 01:06:11,924
- What?
- I'm not good enough.

864
01:06:12,924 --> 01:06:14,966
I'm not good enough.

865
01:06:16,966 --> 01:06:17,966
Are you sure...?

866
01:06:17,966 --> 01:06:20,966
He just knew that there was
still room for improvement.

867
01:06:20,966 --> 01:06:22,966
He is fine.

868
01:06:24,966 --> 01:06:26,924
Sadly, we have a
Self-Conception.

869
01:06:26,924 --> 01:06:28,966
Get us back.  sad,
can you hear us?

870
01:06:32,966 --> 01:06:34,966
I'm not good enough.

871
01:06:43,967 --> 01:06:47,967
I can fix it.  I had to
simply recalibrate the console.

872
01:06:47,967 --> 01:06:49,009
No more surprises.

873
01:06:50,009 --> 01:06:54,967
OK, it should be here, and it's
there.  And not quite there, but here.

874
01:06:54,967 --> 01:06:57,967
We're stepping it up a
bit here. Then fine tune.

875
01:06:57,967 --> 01:06:59,967
The person who was set
up was completely wrong.

876
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:01,926
Sad, now!

877
01:07:12,968 --> 01:07:15,968
- Joy!
- Oh no!

878
01:07:33,969 --> 01:07:36,969
I am a good person.

879
01:07:36,969 --> 01:07:39,969
I'm not good enough.

880
01:07:42,969 --> 01:07:46,969
- It's the only way back.
- We are very close.

881
01:07:55,970 --> 01:07:56,970
Joy!

882
01:07:57,970 --> 01:07:59,970
Where are you going?

883
01:08:15,971 --> 01:08:17,971
28, Anderson.  Leg span.

884
01:08:20,971 --> 01:08:22,971
28, Anderson.  Seatbelt!

885
01:08:29,013 --> 01:08:31,971
28, Anderson.  Seatbelt!

886
01:08:33,971 --> 01:08:35,971
I expected more from you, Riley.

887
01:08:38,972 --> 01:08:39,972
Not that...

888
01:08:46,013 --> 01:08:46,972
What...

889
01:08:53,972 --> 01:08:56,972
Come on.

890
01:08:57,972 --> 01:08:59,931
What am I not seeing?

891
01:09:04,973 --> 01:09:07,973
I am a good person.

892
01:09:14,973 --> 01:09:16,973
Joy.

893
01:09:16,973 --> 01:09:19,015
What are we doing now?

894
01:09:27,974 --> 01:09:28,974
I do not know.

895
01:09:30,974 --> 01:09:34,974
I don't know how
you stop Anxiety.

896
01:09:36,016 --> 01:09:39,974
Maybe we can't do it.

897
01:09:39,974 --> 01:09:43,974
Maybe it's always like
this when you get older.

898
01:09:43,974 --> 01:09:46,974
You feel less happy.

899
01:09:52,975 --> 01:09:54,975
But I am sure of one thing.

900
01:09:56,975 --> 01:10:02,975
Riley would never be himself if we didn't
bring him here to Headquarters.  Quickly.

901
01:10:04,933 --> 01:10:06,934
How?

902
01:10:09,975 --> 01:10:12,975
- Good fight, Riley.
- Thank you, and the same for you.

903
01:10:14,976 --> 01:10:16,976
I'm not good enough.

904
01:10:23,934 --> 01:10:25,018
Yes!  Come on, come on, come on!

905
01:10:25,976 --> 01:10:28,976
Riley, I'm free!  Deliver!

906
01:10:28,976 --> 01:10:31,976
I'm not good enough.

907
01:10:35,976 --> 01:10:38,977
- Well done, Michigan!
- Just save a little for all of us.

908
01:10:38,977 --> 01:10:41,018
Like!  The first of three goals.

909
01:10:41,977 --> 01:10:45,977
How do we get our
self-perception from here to there?

910
01:10:46,977 --> 01:10:50,977
I have an idea, but I
really don't like it.

911
01:10:50,977 --> 01:10:52,977
Angry, Riley needs us.

912
01:10:54,977 --> 01:10:57,977
Oh, the Bag!

913
01:10:59,977 --> 01:11:02,978
What are you waiting
for?  Now say the words!

914
01:11:02,978 --> 01:11:04,978
Oh, the Bag!

915
01:11:11,978 --> 01:11:14,020
Hi everybody.  I am the Bag!

916
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:16,978
- We know that well.
- We're going to Headquarters.

917
01:11:16,978 --> 01:11:19,978
- Do you have anything that can help us?
- I have a lot of things.

918
01:11:19,978 --> 01:11:22,978
What do you think is the best?

919
01:11:22,978 --> 01:11:24,978
Rolls of tape, ducks...

920
01:11:24,978 --> 01:11:26,979
Continue!

921
01:11:28,979 --> 01:11:30,979
Seriously, Wallet?  Dynamite?

922
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:34,020
Don't you have one?
jetpack or plane?

923
01:11:34,979 --> 01:11:35,979
Do you think I have
everything here?

924
01:11:36,979 --> 01:11:38,979
I offer you a bath
duck and duct tape.

925
01:11:38,979 --> 01:11:42,979
Now I have it.  But we
have to use more dynamite.

926
01:11:42,979 --> 01:11:44,979
Do you know?  Good luck.

927
01:11:48,979 --> 01:11:50,980
Come on!  Take the puck!

928
01:11:50,980 --> 01:11:51,980
Take!

929
01:11:53,980 --> 01:11:54,980
I'm not good enough.

930
01:11:56,980 --> 01:12:00,938
What are you doing now?
We are on the same team!

931
01:12:07,022 --> 01:12:08,980
Yes!

932
01:12:08,980 --> 01:12:12,980
Dani might have been a little angry with us,
but everyone forgave us when we joined the team.

933
01:12:13,980 --> 01:12:15,981
Come on, Riley.  One more goal.

934
01:12:21,022 --> 01:12:23,981
Wait a minute, Joy.
Do we blow up the rock?

935
01:12:23,981 --> 01:12:28,981
And returning to Headquarters
amidst an avalanche of bad memories?

936
01:12:28,981 --> 01:12:31,981
How do we avoid these bad
memories creating bad values?

937
01:12:31,981 --> 01:12:32,981
I do not know.

938
01:12:34,981 --> 01:12:36,981
What is wrong?  I join.

939
01:12:36,981 --> 01:12:38,982
- Ready?
- For Riley.

940
01:12:38,982 --> 01:12:41,982
- Now we do it.
- We're coming now, Riley.

941
01:12:55,024 --> 01:12:56,024
Jump!

942
01:13:20,983 --> 01:13:22,983
Come on!

943
01:13:23,983 --> 01:13:24,983
Dirt!

944
01:13:25,983 --> 01:13:29,984
- I'm not good enough.
- You have to score!

945
01:13:38,984 --> 01:13:42,984
- Andersen, penalty box, two minutes.
- NO!

946
01:13:44,026 --> 01:13:45,984
Grace, are you okay?

947
01:13:49,984 --> 01:13:53,985
- We hurt Grace.
- It went very fast.  I do not see it.

948
01:13:59,985 --> 01:14:03,027
- I'm not good enough.
- What have I done?

949
01:14:05,027 --> 01:14:08,985
Oh no.  I fixed
that.  I'll fix it.

950
01:14:47,987 --> 01:14:51,029
I expected more from you, Riley.

951
01:14:51,029 --> 01:14:52,029
NO!

952
01:14:53,987 --> 01:14:55,987
Already come.

953
01:14:55,987 --> 01:14:56,987
I'm not good enough.

954
01:14:57,987 --> 01:15:00,987
Come on, Riley.
Control yourself.

955
01:15:00,987 --> 01:15:02,988
Now control yourself.

956
01:15:02,988 --> 01:15:04,988
I'm not good enough.

957
01:15:04,988 --> 01:15:09,029
You have to score, Riley!
Otherwise, everything is in vain.

958
01:15:09,029 --> 01:15:11,988
Afraid, you pushed him too hard.

959
01:15:29,989 --> 01:15:31,989
OK, take a break!

960
01:15:42,031 --> 01:15:44,989
- Sad!
- Joy!  Help!

961
01:15:46,989 --> 01:15:47,989
We can handle it!

962
01:15:48,989 --> 01:15:51,990
- This won't work!
- That's fear.

963
01:16:08,990 --> 01:16:10,990
Scared, stop!

964
01:16:17,032 --> 01:16:19,991
You don't have to
decide who Riley is.

965
01:16:25,991 --> 01:16:26,991
Worry.

966
01:16:32,033 --> 01:16:33,991
You have to let it go.

967
01:16:57,992 --> 01:16:59,992
I am a good person.

968
01:17:10,993 --> 01:17:13,993
Joy.  Excuse me.

969
01:17:15,993 --> 01:17:17,993
I just tried to protect him.

970
01:17:19,993 --> 01:17:25,993
But you're right.  We don't
need to determine who Riley is.

971
01:17:30,994 --> 01:17:34,994
We keep the best and
throw away the worst!

972
01:17:46,994 --> 01:17:48,994
28, Anderson.  Seatbelt!

973
01:18:12,995 --> 01:18:14,996
I am a good person.

974
01:18:21,996 --> 01:18:22,996
What are you doing now?

975
01:18:34,996 --> 01:18:36,996
I'm selfish.

976
01:18:36,996 --> 01:18:38,997
I'm kind.

977
01:18:39,997 --> 01:18:41,997
I'm not good enough.

978
01:18:42,955 --> 01:18:44,997
I am a good person.

979
01:18:44,997 --> 01:18:48,997
I have to adapt but
I want to be myself.

980
01:18:48,997 --> 01:18:50,997
I'm brave, but I feel scared.

981
01:18:51,039 --> 01:18:54,997
Success means everything.  I
committed error.  I'm funny.  I was led.

982
01:18:54,997 --> 01:18:58,997
I am a good friend.  I am a bad
friend. I am strong.  I am weak.

983
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Riley, are you okay?

984
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:12,042
Yes.  I mean: no.

985
01:20:16,001 --> 01:20:18,001
I really pity you.

986
01:20:19,001 --> 01:20:25,043
When you said you were going to
the second school, I panicked.  And...

987
01:20:28,001 --> 01:20:30,001
I am so sorry.

988
01:20:31,043 --> 01:20:35,001
If you no longer
want to be friends...

989
01:20:35,001 --> 01:20:37,001
... I understand it well.

990
01:20:37,001 --> 01:20:40,002
But I hope that
you can forgive me.

991
01:20:42,002 --> 01:20:43,043
One day.

992
01:21:10,003 --> 01:21:14,045
- Come on, ladies!
- We have to finish the game.

993
01:21:42,004 --> 01:21:46,004
Joy.  Riley wants you.

994
01:22:21,047 --> 01:22:22,047
Riley!

995
01:23:06,008 --> 01:23:08,008
Yes!

996
01:23:29,050 --> 01:23:32,009
Minnesota, your eyes
are glued to the screen.

997
01:23:32,009 --> 01:23:35,009
It's almost two o'clock.
Coach will post the list soon.

998
01:23:35,009 --> 01:23:37,009
- Two o'clock.  He...
- In six minutes.

999
01:23:38,009 --> 01:23:42,009
So what if we don't become one
fire Eagle?  Thanks for asking.

1000
01:23:42,009 --> 01:23:44,051
Mom and Dad will
be disappointed.

1001
01:23:44,051 --> 01:23:47,051
We will not be ice hockey
players, but musical ethnologists.

1002
01:23:47,051 --> 01:23:54,010
- We have no friends and die alone.
- Calm.  None of that is happening right now, is it?

1003
01:23:54,010 --> 01:23:57,010
Cold!  Then we sat down
in our very special chairs.

1004
01:23:57,010 --> 01:24:01,052
- Yes, that's a good idea.
- Isn't it better now?

1005
01:24:01,052 --> 01:24:04,010
Yes, that's the problem.

1006
01:24:04,052 --> 01:24:09,010
We can't control whether Riley
joins the team.  What can we control?

1007
01:24:09,010 --> 01:24:11,010
Riley has a Spanish test
tomorrow.  We have to go.

1008
01:24:12,010 --> 01:24:14,010
- Yes, we really have it...
- Olvidamos!

1009
01:24:14,010 --> 01:24:15,011
- What does it mean?
- "Forget".

1010
01:24:15,011 --> 01:24:18,052
- Great from the start!
- I never thought about that.

1011
01:24:19,011 --> 01:24:20,011
Thank you friends.

1012
01:24:20,011 --> 01:24:23,011
And we have followed along well
throughout the elite training.

1013
01:24:23,053 --> 01:24:28,011
- I'm the only one who thinks about it.
- That's your idea!

1014
01:24:28,011 --> 01:24:32,011
- I envy myself.  Thank You.
- You're welcome!

1015
01:24:32,011 --> 01:24:36,053
- Who said that?
- My new friend, Taskesen.

1016
01:24:36,053 --> 01:24:40,012
- Confetti if we make a team.
- Great idea.

1017
01:24:40,012 --> 01:24:42,012
No matter what,
we love our girls.

1018
01:24:42,012 --> 01:24:45,012
Confetti if not!

1019
01:24:47,012 --> 01:24:50,012
- Is that an email from the coach?
- No, from Bree and Grace.

1020
01:24:50,012 --> 01:24:51,054
Good luck!!

1021
01:24:52,012 --> 01:24:54,012
I miss those girls.

1022
01:24:54,012 --> 01:24:59,012
- Do you remember when Bree, Grace, and us...
- It was too early!

1023
01:24:59,012 --> 01:25:01,012
Then I'll just wait downstairs.

1024
01:25:02,012 --> 01:25:04,013
It's three minutes.
You two.  He succeeded.

1025
01:25:04,013 --> 01:25:08,054
Because he owns
us! Yes!  Correct?

1026
01:25:09,013 --> 01:25:13,013
- Because he... Maybe?
- Well done, Flove!

1027
01:25:13,013 --> 01:25:15,013
Just look at Flove!

1028
01:25:17,013 --> 01:25:20,013
If it doesn't work out this
year, maybe do it next year.

1029
01:25:20,013 --> 01:25:23,013
- Yes.
- I like our girl.

1030
01:25:23,013 --> 01:25:27,055
- Can you do something else?  He is very fast.
- And good at ice hockey.

1031
01:25:28,014 --> 01:25:31,055
- He's creative.
- He can bore us, but never boring.

1032
01:25:31,055 --> 01:25:34,014
He could now be a
little sarcastic.

1033
01:25:34,014 --> 01:25:37,014
He can have real bad ideas.

1034
01:25:37,014 --> 01:25:40,014
Sometimes it is true
that something is wrong.

1035
01:25:40,014 --> 01:25:44,014
And sometimes he is
too hard on himself.

1036
01:25:44,014 --> 01:25:47,014
But all of Riley's
pages shape who he is.

1037
01:25:47,056 --> 01:25:49,014
And we love everything
about our girl.

1038
01:25:51,015 --> 01:25:55,015
Each one is messy,
on the beautiful side.

1039
01:26:03,648 --> 01:26:07,121
OK, Secret Deep Darkness.
The time has come.

1040
01:26:09,131 --> 01:26:12,440
It doesn't matter.
Come out with you.

1041
01:26:12,568 --> 01:26:18,741
Okay.  just get out there,
mate.  What's the secret?

1042
01:26:20,853 --> 01:26:24,638
- We make holes in the carpet.
- Is that all?

1043
01:26:24,766 --> 01:26:30,425
I think we peed in
the pool.  No, wait.

1044
01:26:32,422 --> 01:26:33,525
And he left.

1045
01:26:50,933 --> 01:26:53,933
Riley how did he go to camp?

1046
01:26:53,933 --> 01:26:56,933
We have agreed that
we tell them everything.

1047
01:26:58,975 --> 01:27:03,933
- Also we sneak into the office?
- And Grace's tough tackle?

1048
01:27:03,933 --> 01:27:05,933
- Protest.
- Excuse me.  Excuse me.

1049
01:27:06,933 --> 01:27:08,933
It went well.

1050
01:27:09,933 --> 01:27:12,933
He's gone for three days,
and we only get "fine"?

1051
01:27:12,933 --> 01:27:15,975
What does the red number
mean, is he a gang member?

1052
01:27:15,975 --> 01:27:16,975
Welcome back, Angst.

1053
01:27:18,975 --> 01:27:22,934
He's gone for three days,
and we only get "fine"?

1054
01:27:22,976 --> 01:27:25,934
This might cover it
well. Back to the fight.

1055
01:27:25,934 --> 01:27:28,934
Nice pass to Reeves,
and then down the middle.

1056
01:27:29,934 --> 01:27:31,976
To the limit. What a brazen act!
