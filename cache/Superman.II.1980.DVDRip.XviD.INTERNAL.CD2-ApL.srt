1
00:00:02,264 --> 00:00:04,425
I guess I should be freezing, but I'm not.

2
00:00:04,499 --> 00:00:07,400
Good. Come on, let me show you.

3
00:00:46,408 --> 00:00:48,740
You see? You only smell strong.

4
00:00:53,181 --> 00:00:54,648
Baby!

5
00:00:58,153 --> 00:01:01,281
It's only because I didn't want to
lose my place in the orchestra.

6
00:01:04,326 --> 00:01:06,794
The circus is in town!

7
00:01:09,064 --> 00:01:12,500
Hey, sweet thing!
Set them buns down here!

8
00:01:18,974 --> 00:01:20,635
Let's just hold hands.

9
00:01:25,213 --> 00:01:26,976
Let me know if this tickles.

10
00:01:35,424 --> 00:01:38,291
Your right front tire is flat, Duane.

11
00:01:43,965 --> 00:01:46,092
Sheriff, what happened?

12
00:01:47,669 --> 00:01:48,601
Willie...

13
00:01:49,504 --> 00:01:51,131
I think my arm's broke.

14
00:01:52,307 --> 00:01:53,501
Girl or no girl...

15
00:01:53,575 --> 00:01:56,339
...you're going to spit teeth! Get up!

16
00:02:02,717 --> 00:02:04,548
What the sam hill?

17
00:02:10,425 --> 00:02:12,120
Is that you, Boog?

18
00:02:20,535 --> 00:02:21,399
All right.

19
00:02:21,703 --> 00:02:23,102
Get 'em up, keep 'em up!

20
00:02:23,672 --> 00:02:26,004
These humans are beginning to bore me.

21
00:02:36,585 --> 00:02:38,348
- Please, Mister!
- He's a general.

22
00:02:38,453 --> 00:02:40,648
Mr. General! Please let my daddy down!

23
00:02:46,761 --> 00:02:48,092
You okay, Jody?

24
00:02:51,433 --> 00:02:53,663
When my father died...

25
00:02:54,269 --> 00:02:56,362
...this is my Earth father, I mean...

26
00:02:57,506 --> 00:03:00,168
...I found this crystal.

27
00:03:03,011 --> 00:03:05,673
This is kind of hard to explain,
but you see...

28
00:03:06,314 --> 00:03:07,542
...it called to me.

29
00:03:09,951 --> 00:03:12,215
Yeah. And it brought me here.

30
00:03:13,021 --> 00:03:14,818
It helped me to build this place.

31
00:03:16,124 --> 00:03:17,751
Actually it built it, really.

32
00:03:19,694 --> 00:03:23,425
That's when I found out who I really was...

33
00:03:23,765 --> 00:03:25,392
...and what I had to do.

34
00:03:30,672 --> 00:03:32,503
So what do you think? You like it?

35
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:34,030
Like it?

36
00:03:35,177 --> 00:03:36,576
It's incredible!

37
00:03:37,546 --> 00:03:41,107
I mean, not that it couldn't use
a woman's touch...

38
00:03:41,183 --> 00:03:43,048
...especially around dinner time.

39
00:03:43,118 --> 00:03:47,214
Dinner. I'm sorry.
I don't usually do too much about...

40
00:03:47,856 --> 00:03:50,654
Listen, tonight, sky's the limit.
Anything you want.

41
00:04:39,074 --> 00:04:39,972
I'm home!

42
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:42,734
Should we eat?

43
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,411
- Sure.
- Great.

44
00:04:50,151 --> 00:04:53,518
Good morning, America.
This is East Houston, Idaho...

45
00:04:53,588 --> 00:04:55,920
...until yesterday,
another middle American town...

46
00:04:55,991 --> 00:04:57,959
...that middle America had forgotten.

47
00:04:58,293 --> 00:05:02,195
But today the population,
exaggerated reports put it at 123...

48
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:03,797
...has increased by three.

49
00:05:04,065 --> 00:05:07,125
And these three new arrivals
bring destruction in their wake.

50
00:05:07,202 --> 00:05:10,171
As I look west into East Houston
this morning...

51
00:05:10,238 --> 00:05:11,899
...I see a town gripped with...

52
00:05:12,707 --> 00:05:13,696
...fear.

53
00:05:15,443 --> 00:05:17,104
<i>Who's the big guy?</i>

54
00:05:18,046 --> 00:05:19,946
<i>Okay, yeah, we've got a P. O...</i>

55
00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:21,779
No.

56
00:05:22,017 --> 00:05:24,383
<i>We've got a slight crack in that diode.</i>

57
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,080
<i>- Come in on him if you can.
- Try to wiggle it.</i>

58
00:05:28,156 --> 00:05:29,555
Who else is seeing this?

59
00:05:30,292 --> 00:05:34,490
With this satellite link up,
just about everybody. The whole planet.

60
00:05:34,562 --> 00:05:37,690
- The whole planet Houston?
- Earth.

61
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:39,791
The whole planet Earth.

62
00:05:40,535 --> 00:05:42,093
<i>Get over to the commentator.</i>

63
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:43,894
<i>You may continue.</i>

64
00:05:44,706 --> 00:05:47,607
<i>As the extraordinary story continues...</i>

65
00:05:49,444 --> 00:05:51,435
<i>As this extraordinary story...</i>

66
00:05:51,513 --> 00:05:55,381
If the whole planet is watching, can't we
show them something more interesting?

67
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:57,918
<i>Throw down your arms and surrender!</i>

68
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,047
<i>This is an order!</i>

69
00:06:03,058 --> 00:06:06,391
General Zod does not take orders.
He gives them.

70
00:06:31,219 --> 00:06:32,618
You all right, buddy?

71
00:07:01,683 --> 00:07:04,618
He was right in the line of fire
and nothing happened to him!

72
00:07:04,686 --> 00:07:07,052
I haven't seen the likes of this
since Superman.

73
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:11,825
<i>Yes. The Newsbeat control room
has just informed me...</i>

74
00:07:11,893 --> 00:07:14,919
<i>... that a fleet of helicopter gun ships
is on it's way...</i>

75
00:07:14,996 --> 00:07:18,488
- Mr. President, can't we...
- I'm afraid there's nothing anybody can do.

76
00:07:18,566 --> 00:07:20,966
They have such powers,
nothing can stop them.

77
00:07:21,202 --> 00:07:23,693
Where's Superman? Where is he?

78
00:07:24,038 --> 00:07:25,596
Why doesn't he do something?

79
00:07:26,141 --> 00:07:29,406
General Smythson has informed us
that nuclear weapon strikes...

80
00:07:29,511 --> 00:07:33,345
...have been ruled out because of
the danger to the civilian population.

81
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:43,889
<i>Starting firing run now.</i>

82
00:07:46,428 --> 00:07:47,895
<i>Standby, rockets.</i>

83
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:49,426
<i>Fire one.</i>

84
00:07:52,734 --> 00:07:53,826
<i>Fire again.</i>

85
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:56,859
<i>Fire again.</i>

86
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,145
<i>The rockets didn't have any effect.</i>

87
00:08:08,149 --> 00:08:11,243
Look, they need machines to fly!

88
00:08:13,755 --> 00:08:14,983
What bravery!

89
00:08:15,623 --> 00:08:18,285
Be nice to them, my dear.
Blow them a kiss.

90
00:08:27,268 --> 00:08:29,862
<i>We're out of control. I don't understand.</i>

91
00:08:32,307 --> 00:08:34,775
<i>We're coming in... coming down...
can't control it!</i>

92
00:08:35,477 --> 00:08:37,138
<i>We're coming down!</i>

93
00:08:50,892 --> 00:08:51,790
I win.

94
00:08:54,329 --> 00:08:55,296
I always win.

95
00:08:57,365 --> 00:09:00,266
<i>Is there no one on this planet
to even challenge me?</i>

96
00:09:06,808 --> 00:09:08,571
That was good.

97
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:10,705
I thought we might...

98
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,348
...abandon the orange juice for once.

99
00:09:22,423 --> 00:09:25,153
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

100
00:09:29,397 --> 00:09:31,661
Must be tough being Clark Kent, isn't it?

101
00:09:32,867 --> 00:09:33,891
No.

102
00:09:35,837 --> 00:09:37,464
I really like it sometimes.

103
00:09:38,072 --> 00:09:40,336
Even though I do make a fool of myself.

104
00:09:42,043 --> 00:09:44,011
You know, if it weren't for him...

105
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:46,471
...I never would have met you.

106
00:09:48,349 --> 00:09:50,840
But... he is you.

107
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,417
It's kind of confusing.

108
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:57,622
Not to me, it isn't.

109
00:10:00,395 --> 00:10:02,158
For the first time in my life...

110
00:10:03,598 --> 00:10:04,895
...everything's clear.

111
00:10:29,444 --> 00:10:32,504
I'm going to go change into something
more comfortable.

112
00:10:47,295 --> 00:10:50,924
Come forward.
Your general wishes to speak.

113
00:10:51,299 --> 00:10:53,392
I am General Zod.

114
00:10:54,402 --> 00:10:55,391
Your ruler.

115
00:10:56,905 --> 00:11:00,306
Yes, today begins a new order!

116
00:11:01,176 --> 00:11:05,010
Your lands, your possessions,
your very lives...

117
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,743
...will gladly be given
in tribute to me, General Zod!

118
00:11:09,584 --> 00:11:11,347
In return for your obedience...

119
00:11:11,419 --> 00:11:14,388
...you will enjoy my generous protection.

120
00:11:14,489 --> 00:11:17,424
In other words, you will be allowed to live.

121
00:11:20,896 --> 00:11:22,864
So you are a general...

122
00:11:24,966 --> 00:11:26,957
And who is your superior?

123
00:11:27,869 --> 00:11:31,999
- I answer only to the president.
- And he will answer to me...

124
00:11:34,209 --> 00:11:37,406
...or all of his cities
will end up like this one!

125
00:11:38,346 --> 00:11:42,009
<i>Your father and I have tried to anticipate
your every question, Kal-El.</i>

126
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,718
<i>This is the one we hoped
you would not ask.</i>

127
00:11:45,187 --> 00:11:49,146
But I have to, because...
she's everything I want in life.

128
00:11:50,525 --> 00:11:52,823
<i>And she, the one you have chosen...</i>

129
00:11:53,728 --> 00:11:55,696
<i>... she feels as much for you?</i>

130
00:11:56,731 --> 00:11:57,595
Yes.

131
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:59,429
<i>Then if this is what you wish...</i>

132
00:11:59,935 --> 00:12:02,631
<i>... if you intend to live your life
with a mortal...</i>

133
00:12:03,205 --> 00:12:05,696
<i>... you must live as a mortal.</i>

134
00:12:06,274 --> 00:12:08,139
<i>You must become one of them.</i>

135
00:12:10,011 --> 00:12:14,607
<i>This crystal chamber has harnessed
the rays of the red sun of Krypton.</i>

136
00:12:15,483 --> 00:12:17,974
<i>Once exposed to these rays, all...</i>

137
00:12:18,053 --> 00:12:21,614
<i>... your great powers on Earth
will disappear forever.</i>

138
00:12:26,895 --> 00:12:28,328
<i>But consider...</i>

139
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:30,989
<i>... once it is done, there is no return.</i>

140
00:12:31,466 --> 00:12:33,400
<i>You will become an ordinary man.</i>

141
00:12:33,935 --> 00:12:36,335
<i>You will feel like an ordinary man.</i>

142
00:12:37,105 --> 00:12:40,074
<i>You can be hurt like an ordinary man.</i>

143
00:12:50,752 --> 00:12:53,653
<i>My son, are you sure?</i>

144
00:13:01,396 --> 00:13:02,420
Mother...

145
00:13:04,032 --> 00:13:05,397
...I love her.

146
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,205
You did all that for me?

147
00:15:00,315 --> 00:15:02,146
I don't know what to say.

148
00:15:04,419 --> 00:15:05,943
Just say you love me.

149
00:15:56,838 --> 00:16:00,535
Thousands of hours to create,
and they defaced it in seconds.

150
00:16:00,775 --> 00:16:03,710
Imagine what they'll do to the world
if we resist.

151
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:11,075
The whole place is going to fall!

152
00:17:11,146 --> 00:17:11,976
Watch it!

153
00:17:48,082 --> 00:17:49,982
You are the one they call President?

154
00:17:50,585 --> 00:17:51,415
I am.

155
00:17:54,889 --> 00:17:58,120
I see you are practiced
in worshipping things that fly.

156
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:00,753
Good.

157
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,156
Rise before Zod.

158
00:18:08,403 --> 00:18:11,372
Now, kneel before Zod.

159
00:18:25,587 --> 00:18:27,111
You are not the President.

160
00:18:27,488 --> 00:18:31,117
No one who leads so many
could possibly kneel so quickly.

161
00:18:32,493 --> 00:18:34,256
I am the man they are protecting.

162
00:18:35,496 --> 00:18:36,827
I am the President.

163
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:40,563
I'll kneel before you if it will save lives.

164
00:18:40,935 --> 00:18:44,268
It will. Starting with your own.

165
00:18:58,019 --> 00:19:02,115
What I do now,
I do for the sake of the people of the world.

166
00:19:03,424 --> 00:19:07,292
But there is one man here on Earth
who will never kneel before you.

167
00:19:07,829 --> 00:19:10,320
Who is this imbecile? Where is he?

168
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:11,890
I wish I knew.

169
00:19:17,372 --> 00:19:18,566
God.

170
00:19:19,274 --> 00:19:20,172
Zod.

171
00:19:24,479 --> 00:19:27,846
You're awfully quiet over there.
I'm supposed to be the shy one.

172
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,844
Yeah, I was just thinking...

173
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:35,814
...I can't believe
what you've given up for me.

174
00:19:37,258 --> 00:19:40,386
Are you kidding?
I didn't do it for you, Lois, I did it for us.

175
00:19:41,162 --> 00:19:44,393
See, I told you there'd be
a hot dog place somewhere.

176
00:19:44,532 --> 00:19:47,592
Okay. It sure takes longer
when you can't fly.

177
00:19:48,503 --> 00:19:49,731
Hurry up.

178
00:19:50,338 --> 00:19:51,805
- Come on.
- Okay.

179
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,164
My back's stiff.

180
00:19:55,576 --> 00:19:57,373
Come on, it's my treat.

181
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:03,910
Oh, boy, it's Mr. Wonderful.

182
00:20:05,453 --> 00:20:06,784
Thank you.

183
00:20:10,224 --> 00:20:12,590
- Do you have a men's room?
- Right in the corner.

184
00:20:12,994 --> 00:20:15,121
- Want to sit down?
- Yeah.

185
00:20:17,665 --> 00:20:19,257
What would you folks like?

186
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,733
I'd like a cheeseburger
with everything on it and a Coke...

187
00:20:22,904 --> 00:20:26,567
...and an order of fries
and a side salad, please.

188
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:29,342
For you, sir?

189
00:20:29,777 --> 00:20:32,371
- I'll think about it when I get back.
- Right.

190
00:20:32,613 --> 00:20:35,173
- Steak and eggs, over easy, coffee.
- My Coke, please.

191
00:20:35,249 --> 00:20:36,181
Coming up.

192
00:20:37,552 --> 00:20:38,985
Sorry, that seat's taken.

193
00:20:39,153 --> 00:20:40,780
It is now, sweetheart.

194
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:44,053
Can I buy you something to eat?

195
00:20:44,892 --> 00:20:46,257
No, thank you.

196
00:20:47,428 --> 00:20:49,658
Excuse me.
I think you're sitting in my seat.

197
00:20:50,631 --> 00:20:52,792
Your seat's in there, four-eyes.

198
00:20:56,237 --> 00:20:59,695
I think, perhaps somebody
ought to teach you some manners, sir.

199
00:21:01,209 --> 00:21:03,803
Yeah? Let me know when he comes in.

200
00:21:03,911 --> 00:21:06,072
- Look, we can just...
- Honey...

201
00:21:07,682 --> 00:21:10,014
Excuse me, sir,
would you care to step outside?

202
00:21:10,218 --> 00:21:12,880
I said, excuse me, sir,
would you care to step outside?

203
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:18,818
Now listen, your steak's coming right up.

204
00:21:19,594 --> 00:21:22,893
Keep it on the flame,
this is just a minute steak.

205
00:21:24,565 --> 00:21:25,998
After you.

206
00:21:35,243 --> 00:21:36,870
You all right?

207
00:21:36,944 --> 00:21:39,174
He's going to be fine, just give me that.

208
00:21:40,515 --> 00:21:42,745
Blood. It's my blood.

209
00:21:44,118 --> 00:21:45,050
I think...

210
00:21:45,653 --> 00:21:48,383
...maybe we ought to hire a bodyguard
from now on.

211
00:21:48,856 --> 00:21:52,019
I don't want a bodyguard.
I want the man I fell in love with.

212
00:21:52,293 --> 00:21:53,726
I know that.

213
00:21:54,662 --> 00:21:56,459
I wish he were here.

214
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,734
Boy, you just don't have enough sense
to stay down do you?

215
00:22:23,591 --> 00:22:25,821
I don't like your meat, anyway.

216
00:22:27,995 --> 00:22:29,394
Oh, God.

217
00:22:40,975 --> 00:22:41,999
Can you get up?

218
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:44,744
- It's all right. I got you.
- Go slow.

219
00:22:44,812 --> 00:22:45,870
Try and get up in that chair.

220
00:22:48,816 --> 00:22:50,784
- Sit down.
- I'm all right.

221
00:22:53,621 --> 00:22:56,613
He's all right. Just relax.
We'll have some fresh coffee.

222
00:22:56,757 --> 00:22:58,554
I'll turn the box on.

223
00:22:59,994 --> 00:23:02,690
<i>We interrupt this program
for an urgent message...</i>

224
00:23:02,797 --> 00:23:05,095
<i>... from the President of the United States.</i>

225
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,829
<i>This is your President.</i>

226
00:23:08,536 --> 00:23:13,166
<i>On behalf of my country and in the name
of the other leaders of the world...</i>

227
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:16,170
<i>... with whom I have today consulted...</i>

228
00:23:17,044 --> 00:23:19,638
<i>... I hereby abdicate...</i>

229
00:23:20,248 --> 00:23:23,877
<i>... all authority
and control over this planet...</i>

230
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:26,112
<i>... to General Zod.</i>

231
00:23:28,389 --> 00:23:32,018
<i>Only by strict compliance
with all his directions...</i>

232
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:36,657
<i>... will the lives
of innocent millions be spared.</i>

233
00:23:37,431 --> 00:23:39,058
<i>Superman, can you hear me?</i>

234
00:23:39,133 --> 00:23:42,762
<i>- Superman, where...
- Who is this Superman?</i>

235
00:23:43,204 --> 00:23:45,502
<i>You'll find out! And when you do...</i>

236
00:23:45,573 --> 00:23:49,031
<i>Come to me, Superman! If you dare!</i>

237
00:23:49,477 --> 00:23:50,944
<i>I defy you!</i>

238
00:23:51,178 --> 00:23:54,579
<i>Come! Come and kneel before Zod!</i>

239
00:24:00,054 --> 00:24:01,954
- Here? When?
- When?

240
00:24:02,089 --> 00:24:03,283
Where have you been?

241
00:24:03,558 --> 00:24:05,253
On a desert island?

242
00:24:08,195 --> 00:24:09,856
I have to go back.

243
00:24:10,431 --> 00:24:12,092
You can't go back.

244
00:24:12,466 --> 00:24:14,593
- There's no way, now.
- I have to.

245
00:24:15,102 --> 00:24:18,401
I've got to try, damn it!
I've got to try something. Anything!

246
00:24:18,639 --> 00:24:20,698
It's not your fault.

247
00:24:21,676 --> 00:24:24,440
You didn't know this was going to happen.

248
00:24:26,213 --> 00:24:27,771
They knew.

249
00:24:28,349 --> 00:24:30,044
I heard them.

250
00:24:30,818 --> 00:24:32,843
I just didn't listen.

251
00:25:02,917 --> 00:25:04,544
Hey, come on!

252
00:25:49,196 --> 00:25:50,595
Father?

253
00:25:51,198 --> 00:25:52,563
Mother?

254
00:25:55,536 --> 00:25:58,004
I really wish you could hear me.

255
00:25:59,407 --> 00:26:01,136
Because I need you.

256
00:26:03,444 --> 00:26:04,843
See, I...

257
00:26:07,748 --> 00:26:09,272
...I...

258
00:26:10,618 --> 00:26:12,415
I failed.

259
00:26:17,958 --> 00:26:19,949
Father!

260
00:27:34,268 --> 00:27:35,758
You're master of all you survey.

261
00:27:37,071 --> 00:27:38,971
And so I was yesterday.

262
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:41,069
And the day before.

263
00:27:55,823 --> 00:27:56,790
Hello, there.

264
00:27:58,492 --> 00:28:00,016
Lex Luthor.

265
00:28:05,366 --> 00:28:08,096
You may know the name.
The greatest criminal mind on Earth.

266
00:28:08,869 --> 00:28:11,303
I told you this was a puny planet.

267
00:28:11,572 --> 00:28:13,199
Wait, just a moment.

268
00:28:13,407 --> 00:28:16,342
Wait until you get to know me better,
will you, please?

269
00:28:16,811 --> 00:28:20,474
Wait, I can give you anything you want.

270
00:28:20,614 --> 00:28:24,550
I can give you the brass ring,
the unlimited freedom to maim...

271
00:28:24,852 --> 00:28:26,945
...kill, destroy.

272
00:28:28,022 --> 00:28:32,186
Plus, Lex Luthor's keen mind.
Lex Luthor's savvy.

273
00:28:32,827 --> 00:28:37,059
Lex Luthor's career guidance.
Lex Luthor's School of Better...

274
00:28:38,966 --> 00:28:41,298
We have all of this without you.

275
00:28:42,036 --> 00:28:44,266
You cannot bargain
with what you don't have.

276
00:28:45,005 --> 00:28:46,734
Magnificent One.

277
00:28:48,275 --> 00:28:51,335
What I am bargaining with
is what you do not have.

278
00:28:51,779 --> 00:28:53,041
The son of Jor-El.

279
00:28:53,514 --> 00:28:56,278
The son of Jor-El? On this planet?

280
00:28:57,051 --> 00:29:01,112
<i>Possibly you know him better
by his nom de voyage, or his...</i>

281
00:29:01,455 --> 00:29:02,979
...name he travels under.

282
00:29:03,057 --> 00:29:03,819
Superman.

283
00:29:07,194 --> 00:29:08,752
So, this is Superman.

284
00:29:10,364 --> 00:29:13,128
- How do you know of Jor-El?
- My Fullness...

285
00:29:13,601 --> 00:29:15,831
...as I explained to you before...

286
00:29:17,238 --> 00:29:18,637
I'm the best there is.

287
00:29:18,973 --> 00:29:22,204
Revenge! We will kill the son of our jailer.

288
00:29:22,443 --> 00:29:25,378
- Revenge!
- Revenge! Now we're cooking!

289
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,544
- He flies?
- Constantly.

290
00:29:27,815 --> 00:29:31,182
- He has powers as we do?
- Certainly. But...

291
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:37,047
Magnificent One, he's just one...

292
00:29:37,658 --> 00:29:39,558
...where you are three.

293
00:29:41,228 --> 00:29:42,889
Or four if you count him twice.

294
00:29:42,963 --> 00:29:44,624
We will bring him to his knees.

295
00:29:44,698 --> 00:29:45,392
Wait!

296
00:29:47,768 --> 00:29:48,928
First, you must find him.

297
00:29:49,436 --> 00:29:52,064
And Lex baby is the only one
who knows where he is.

298
00:29:54,275 --> 00:29:56,709
What... do you want?

299
00:29:57,044 --> 00:29:58,409
Well, General...

300
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,314
The world is a big place.

301
00:30:02,049 --> 00:30:03,846
Thank goodness...

302
00:30:04,652 --> 00:30:06,347
...my needs are small.

303
00:30:08,088 --> 00:30:13,526
As it turns out,
I have this affinity for beachfront property.

304
00:30:15,696 --> 00:30:16,754
What do you want?

305
00:30:18,299 --> 00:30:19,357
Australia.

306
00:30:24,204 --> 00:30:25,603
I can't understand it!

307
00:30:25,873 --> 00:30:29,036
Where is he? He shows up every time
a cat gets stuck in a tree...

308
00:30:29,143 --> 00:30:31,611
...and now he's decided to pull
a disappearing act?

309
00:30:31,712 --> 00:30:34,681
- We haven't figured out his game plan.
- Game plan!

310
00:30:35,149 --> 00:30:39,415
It's fourth down, the two-minute warning
has sounded and the ball is in our territory.

311
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,512
How brilliant do you have to be? I mean...

312
00:30:45,059 --> 00:30:48,153
Superman's got something up his sleeve,
that's for sure.

313
00:30:48,562 --> 00:30:51,554
- We haven't figured it out. Right?
- He'll be here!

314
00:30:52,633 --> 00:30:54,658
If it's at all possible, he'll be here.

315
00:30:55,302 --> 00:30:56,064
See?

316
00:30:56,337 --> 00:30:58,965
And she knows his plays
better than anybody.

317
00:31:02,843 --> 00:31:04,868
Better than anybody.

318
00:31:05,379 --> 00:31:07,779
Maybe he hasn't heard about it yet.

319
00:31:16,724 --> 00:31:18,123
Sounds like an earthquake.

320
00:32:02,036 --> 00:32:03,765
Quick, take a picture!

321
00:32:31,565 --> 00:32:33,260
You all right, chief?

322
00:32:33,867 --> 00:32:37,633
Even with accumulated knowledge when'll
these dummies learn to use a doorknob?

323
00:32:38,338 --> 00:32:39,362
Hi!

324
00:32:41,875 --> 00:32:44,503
You should see the White House,
months of cleaning.

325
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,911
You promised me the son of Jor-El.

326
00:32:50,784 --> 00:32:51,876
Yes, your Grace.

327
00:32:52,586 --> 00:32:53,553
But...

328
00:32:53,787 --> 00:32:56,051
...what I've given you
is the next best thing.

329
00:32:56,123 --> 00:32:57,556
Hold on to that little lady...

330
00:32:57,624 --> 00:32:59,319
...and he'll be along.

331
00:33:00,227 --> 00:33:01,956
They have this relationship.

332
00:33:02,096 --> 00:33:05,930
She does all his public relations
and he gives her every exclusive.

333
00:33:06,266 --> 00:33:08,996
They're the best of friends.
Know what I mean?

334
00:33:09,603 --> 00:33:12,663
What an undemanding male
this Superman must be.

335
00:33:12,873 --> 00:33:14,932
You could use a tuck here and there.

336
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:16,372
Wait!

337
00:33:17,277 --> 00:33:19,108
- I'm sorry!
- She lives for now.

338
00:33:19,847 --> 00:33:21,007
Kill the rest...

339
00:33:21,415 --> 00:33:22,404
...starting with him.

340
00:33:23,851 --> 00:33:25,443
Wait. Wait.

341
00:33:26,086 --> 00:33:28,111
Remember the White House?
The Oval Room?

342
00:33:28,422 --> 00:33:29,889
We had a few laughs, right?

343
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:49,633
General...

344
00:33:51,111 --> 00:33:52,908
...would you care to step outside?

345
00:33:53,313 --> 00:33:54,507
Superman!

346
00:33:55,449 --> 00:33:56,643
Superman, thank God.

347
00:33:57,584 --> 00:33:58,949
I mean, get him!

348
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,986
Come to me, Son of Jor-El!

349
00:34:02,289 --> 00:34:04,587
Kneel before Zod!

350
00:34:24,378 --> 00:34:26,403
Watch out. You all right?

351
00:34:36,156 --> 00:34:37,521
Wait there.

352
00:34:47,834 --> 00:34:49,199
Son of Jor-El!

353
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:52,336
We were beginning to think
you were a coward!

354
00:34:52,839 --> 00:34:54,033
I'm not a coward.

355
00:34:55,509 --> 00:34:57,136
Let him prove it!

356
00:35:16,396 --> 00:35:18,921
Then die as you deserve to!

357
00:35:29,209 --> 00:35:31,404
Come on, get him!

358
00:35:31,745 --> 00:35:33,770
This is going to be good!

359
00:35:38,652 --> 00:35:40,847
Take him. He's yours.

360
00:36:08,181 --> 00:36:10,206
Come on! Kill him!

361
00:36:10,817 --> 00:36:12,216
<i>Superman...</i>

362
00:36:20,961 --> 00:36:23,759
The big one's just as strong as Superman!

363
00:36:55,896 --> 00:36:56,658
Hold him.

364
00:36:59,566 --> 00:37:01,227
Home run!

365
00:37:49,916 --> 00:37:53,613
This "super" man is nothing of the kind.

366
00:37:54,154 --> 00:37:56,281
I've discovered his weakness.

367
00:37:56,957 --> 00:37:57,981
He cares.

368
00:37:58,492 --> 00:38:01,484
He actually cares for these Earth people.

369
00:38:01,895 --> 00:38:04,728
- Like pets?
- I suppose so.

370
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:07,464
Sentimental idiot.

371
00:38:12,973 --> 00:38:14,497
He's caged Non.

372
00:38:15,976 --> 00:38:17,773
I'll draw his fire.

373
00:38:17,978 --> 00:38:19,843
With some of my own.

374
00:38:55,515 --> 00:38:57,915
Get out of here! The rig's going to blow!

375
00:40:48,094 --> 00:40:50,153
Superman, help us!

376
00:41:51,324 --> 00:41:53,758
I never thought this thing
would go the distance.

377
00:41:55,929 --> 00:41:57,487
You people, get back.

378
00:41:57,897 --> 00:41:59,831
Here, take the end of this.

379
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,848
No. Don't do it!

380
00:42:16,549 --> 00:42:17,948
The people!

381
00:42:58,058 --> 00:42:59,889
Where's you wife, sir?

382
00:42:59,959 --> 00:43:02,154
I got her. Don't worry.

383
00:43:02,328 --> 00:43:03,454
He's dead.

384
00:43:05,265 --> 00:43:06,562
Superman is dead.

385
00:43:08,935 --> 00:43:10,266
They killed Superman.

386
00:43:13,707 --> 00:43:14,765
Let's get them!

387
00:43:15,108 --> 00:43:17,201
Come on, let's go!

388
00:43:52,445 --> 00:43:53,878
Forgot your change!

389
00:43:57,383 --> 00:43:58,850
Wait a minute!

390
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:05,319
I'm holding it, I'm holding it!

391
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,952
I can't see what's happening!

392
00:44:14,701 --> 00:44:16,293
- My hair!
- What about mine?

393
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:17,966
Hold on!

394
00:45:41,354 --> 00:45:42,218
He's alive!

395
00:46:02,108 --> 00:46:04,076
Come back, please!

396
00:46:07,981 --> 00:46:08,777
So...

397
00:46:09,549 --> 00:46:12,017
...he is a coward after all.

398
00:46:14,554 --> 00:46:16,044
Come back, Superman!

399
00:46:23,830 --> 00:46:26,526
- Don't leave us!
- We can't handle it without you.

400
00:46:26,966 --> 00:46:29,935
- It's not our fault.
- He chickened out.

401
00:46:31,070 --> 00:46:31,968
Phony!

402
00:46:33,273 --> 00:46:35,138
Superman didn't even do nothing!

403
00:46:35,675 --> 00:46:37,336
Come on, let's go!

404
00:46:39,212 --> 00:46:40,770
Get away from here!

405
00:46:45,985 --> 00:46:47,452
Our victory is complete!

406
00:46:48,021 --> 00:46:49,545
The son of Jor-El has fled.

407
00:46:49,889 --> 00:46:51,049
Superman fled?

408
00:46:51,624 --> 00:46:52,852
I don't believe you.

409
00:46:53,126 --> 00:46:55,526
- The next time we will kill him!
- The next time?

410
00:46:57,230 --> 00:46:58,720
The next time?

411
00:46:59,966 --> 00:47:01,934
What am I going to do with you people?

412
00:47:02,435 --> 00:47:04,835
I held up my end, I delivered the Blue Boy.

413
00:47:05,171 --> 00:47:07,071
What do I get from my triple threat?

414
00:47:07,206 --> 00:47:10,334
"Bow, yield, kneel," that kind of stuff
closes out a town.

415
00:47:10,810 --> 00:47:14,769
Why do you say this to me
when you know I will kill you for it?

416
00:47:15,114 --> 00:47:18,140
Kill me? Lex Luthor?

417
00:47:19,352 --> 00:47:22,185
Extinguish the greatest
criminal flame of our age?

418
00:47:22,388 --> 00:47:24,982
- Eradicate the only man on earth with...
- Kill him!

419
00:47:25,825 --> 00:47:27,315
Superman's address?

420
00:47:30,029 --> 00:47:31,496
Come!

421
00:47:32,031 --> 00:47:35,023
The three of us will crush...

422
00:47:35,268 --> 00:47:37,259
...the son of our jailer.

423
00:47:37,370 --> 00:47:39,804
Why not increase his handicap?

424
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:43,136
Since he cares so much
for these Earth creatures...

425
00:47:43,576 --> 00:47:45,703
...let us take his favorite.

426
00:48:40,266 --> 00:48:41,927
Ever heard of parachutes?

427
00:48:47,273 --> 00:48:49,173
Another small step for mankind.

428
00:48:50,810 --> 00:48:51,970
Scruffy.

429
00:48:53,379 --> 00:48:54,869
So morbid.

430
00:48:55,548 --> 00:48:58,813
A sentimental replica
of a planet long since vanished.

431
00:49:00,253 --> 00:49:02,687
- No style at all.
- I expect...

432
00:49:03,489 --> 00:49:05,320
...better manners from my guests.

433
00:49:21,107 --> 00:49:22,734
We must combine our strength.

434
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,531
Fools!

435
00:49:49,068 --> 00:49:50,194
Take him!

436
00:50:24,637 --> 00:50:27,470
We played this game at school.
Never was very good at it.

437
00:50:29,275 --> 00:50:31,470
Superman, I knew that you'd...

438
00:50:36,015 --> 00:50:37,642
Wrong again!

439
00:50:40,887 --> 00:50:42,684
No, no!

440
00:50:43,456 --> 00:50:44,616
Release the General...

441
00:50:44,790 --> 00:50:46,655
...or we'll tear her apart.

442
00:50:46,726 --> 00:50:47,750
Superman, no!

443
00:50:49,462 --> 00:50:50,656
Superman, don't!

444
00:50:51,864 --> 00:50:52,592
All right!

445
00:51:04,710 --> 00:51:07,770
Did you really think
we would give up our advantage?

446
00:51:08,114 --> 00:51:09,172
Now...

447
00:51:09,582 --> 00:51:11,812
...the son of Jor-El will be my slave.

448
00:51:12,151 --> 00:51:12,879
Forever.

449
00:51:13,619 --> 00:51:16,645
If not,
the millions of earthlings you protect...

450
00:51:17,123 --> 00:51:19,216
...will pay for your defiance.

451
00:51:19,725 --> 00:51:21,454
Destroy this place.

452
00:51:21,661 --> 00:51:24,789
- Hi, guys. Sorry I'm late.
- We have no more use for this one.

453
00:51:25,164 --> 00:51:25,960
Kill him.

454
00:51:26,399 --> 00:51:27,457
Me?

455
00:51:31,404 --> 00:51:33,929
You came to me with nothing,
I gave you Superman.

456
00:51:34,407 --> 00:51:35,431
Silence!

457
00:51:35,975 --> 00:51:37,033
Well, look...

458
00:51:37,443 --> 00:51:39,411
Watch it. Don't touch me!

459
00:51:41,747 --> 00:51:43,305
Guy's a clod.

460
00:51:45,151 --> 00:51:47,381
Promises were made, gifts exchanged.

461
00:51:47,853 --> 00:51:50,981
I got to hand it to you.
You always told the truth.

462
00:51:51,390 --> 00:51:53,915
A guy always knew
where he stood with you.

463
00:51:56,662 --> 00:51:59,722
Try to get them all
into this molecule chamber.

464
00:52:00,566 --> 00:52:04,058
It takes away their powers, see,
and turns them into ordinary...

465
00:52:04,237 --> 00:52:06,671
...human beings. Now, if you could...

466
00:52:09,809 --> 00:52:11,276
Don't go in there, it's a trap!

467
00:52:11,344 --> 00:52:12,834
You poisonous snake!

468
00:52:13,446 --> 00:52:14,936
That's a molecule chamber.

469
00:52:15,147 --> 00:52:18,446
It makes people like you
into people like me.

470
00:52:19,051 --> 00:52:20,518
You've done well.

471
00:52:23,289 --> 00:52:26,053
The crystal there activates the mechanism.

472
00:52:26,759 --> 00:52:29,284
Lex Luthor, ruler of Australia.

473
00:52:29,629 --> 00:52:31,256
Activate the machine!

474
00:52:34,367 --> 00:52:35,459
Thank you.

475
00:52:38,371 --> 00:52:40,168
With your permission.

476
00:53:53,579 --> 00:53:54,637
And now...

477
00:53:55,648 --> 00:53:56,637
...finally.

478
00:54:07,193 --> 00:54:08,717
Take my hand...

479
00:54:09,729 --> 00:54:14,666
...and swear eternal loyalty to Zod.

480
00:54:54,573 --> 00:54:55,699
He switched it!

481
00:54:56,208 --> 00:54:59,837
He did it to them!
I mean the lights were on out here...

482
00:55:00,513 --> 00:55:02,105
...while he was safe in there!

483
00:55:04,316 --> 00:55:05,874
You know, something?

484
00:55:06,652 --> 00:55:08,745
You're a real pain in the neck!

485
00:55:18,297 --> 00:55:20,390
Are you all right?

486
00:55:21,434 --> 00:55:24,961
I knew you'd double-cross me.
A lying, weasel like you couldn't resist.

487
00:55:26,505 --> 00:55:29,838
Are you kidding?
I was with you all the time.

488
00:55:30,543 --> 00:55:31,703
That was beautiful.

489
00:55:31,777 --> 00:55:34,007
Did you see the way they fell into our trap?

490
00:55:34,346 --> 00:55:36,211
Too late!

491
00:55:36,649 --> 00:55:39,243
Look.

492
00:55:40,085 --> 00:55:41,313
I got a proposition.

493
00:55:42,087 --> 00:55:44,612
Don't stop me
until you've heard this because...

494
00:55:45,224 --> 00:55:48,421
...I know I owe you one,
but we're in the north pole, right?

495
00:55:49,195 --> 00:55:50,856
Let's wipe the slate clean.

496
00:55:51,063 --> 00:55:54,726
If you give me a ride back,
I promise to turn over a new leaf...

497
00:55:58,904 --> 00:56:01,395
It looks so beautiful from up here.

498
00:56:02,341 --> 00:56:05,333
I guess I'll never get to fly with you again.

499
00:56:06,145 --> 00:56:08,545
No. Anywhere you want to go.

500
00:56:09,482 --> 00:56:11,109
You don't have to worry.

501
00:56:11,550 --> 00:56:13,916
I'll never tell them who you really are.

502
00:56:14,453 --> 00:56:15,943
I know.

503
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:32,462
See you later.

504
00:57:04,303 --> 00:57:05,497
Hi.

505
00:57:32,932 --> 00:57:34,092
How did you sleep?

506
00:57:37,503 --> 00:57:40,233
No. I didn't close my eyes all night.

507
00:57:45,844 --> 00:57:48,904
- Look...
- I understand.

508
00:57:51,584 --> 00:57:55,281
I sat up all night listening to
the voices of reason.

509
00:57:56,355 --> 00:57:59,449
You know how vile it is to hear
the first bird of the morning...

510
00:57:59,525 --> 00:58:01,550
...when you've been crying all night?

511
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:02,490
I'm sorry.

512
00:58:03,462 --> 00:58:04,861
I'm sorry, too.

513
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:10,365
I guess it's sort of like being
married to a doctor, you know.

514
00:58:10,903 --> 00:58:12,837
The doctor's awakened at night...

515
00:58:12,905 --> 00:58:16,033
...and the wife has to cope with the fact
that he's gone.

516
00:58:17,276 --> 00:58:18,868
I guess I'm just too selfish.

517
00:58:19,878 --> 00:58:21,743
No. You're not selfish at all.

518
00:58:22,314 --> 00:58:24,305
I am selfish, when it comes to you.

519
00:58:24,516 --> 00:58:25,983
I am selfish.

520
00:58:26,652 --> 00:58:29,212
I'm jealous of the whole world.

521
00:58:33,892 --> 00:58:38,329
It may not be easy for you
to hear this now, but someday you'll...

522
00:58:42,735 --> 00:58:45,226
Don't tell me that I'll meet somebody.

523
00:58:46,438 --> 00:58:49,771
You're kind of a tough act to follow,
you know?

524
00:58:54,046 --> 00:58:56,913
I'm going to be fine,
you don't have to worry about me.

525
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:03,945
I like worrying about you.

526
00:59:05,591 --> 00:59:07,252
Would you stop?

527
00:59:08,093 --> 00:59:10,789
Don't you know that this is killing me?

528
00:59:11,397 --> 00:59:15,231
Do you know what it's like
to have you come in here every morning...

529
00:59:15,367 --> 00:59:17,801
...and not be able to talk to you?

530
00:59:18,570 --> 00:59:21,869
Not be able to show
I have any feelings for you?

531
00:59:22,408 --> 00:59:25,673
Not be able to tell anyone
that I know who you are.

532
00:59:26,245 --> 00:59:28,736
I don't even know what to call you.

533
00:59:32,885 --> 00:59:34,876
I don't know what to say.

534
00:59:38,290 --> 00:59:40,918
I don't know. Say that you love me.

535
01:00:29,341 --> 01:00:31,775
Gee, are you okay? What happened?

536
01:00:32,111 --> 01:00:34,807
- You all right?
- I just got so dizzy.

537
01:00:36,515 --> 01:00:39,416
That's what happens
when I don't have my orange juice.

538
01:00:40,219 --> 01:00:42,915
- I'm fine.
- Breathe.

539
01:00:42,988 --> 01:00:46,355
- I'm breathing, for heaven's sake.
- Good for you. Good.

540
01:00:46,759 --> 01:00:48,659
- God.
- Just drink.

541
01:00:49,061 --> 01:00:51,655
- Okay.
- Just sip it. Sip it. Sip it.

542
01:00:51,764 --> 01:00:53,026
I'm fine.

543
01:00:56,001 --> 01:00:57,832
What was I talking about before?

544
01:00:58,070 --> 01:01:00,538
If I know you,
it was probably about Superman.

545
01:01:01,106 --> 01:01:02,334
Him again?

546
01:01:02,474 --> 01:01:07,173
You've got to stop being threatened
every time the guy's name's mentioned.

547
01:01:07,246 --> 01:01:10,147
I mean, nobody expects you to be
anything but what you are.

548
01:01:10,249 --> 01:01:11,648
I'll try to remember that.

549
01:01:11,717 --> 01:01:14,447
You better remember that.
I appreciate you.

550
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:16,215
- You do?
- Sure.

551
01:01:16,588 --> 01:01:18,783
Especially if you get me a hamburger.

552
01:01:19,324 --> 01:01:22,657
A hamburger. At 9:00 a. M?

553
01:01:23,095 --> 01:01:24,858
Yeah, and everything on it, okay?

554
01:01:24,930 --> 01:01:26,557
Everything on it.

555
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:30,727
- And...
- Orange juice. Freshly squeezed.

556
01:01:31,670 --> 01:01:33,433
Isn't he a nice guy?

557
01:01:34,473 --> 01:01:37,670
Let's see what trouble I can get into today.

558
01:01:41,814 --> 01:01:43,441
What's happening in the world?

559
01:02:02,034 --> 01:02:04,002
Give me another plate of this garbage.

560
01:02:04,203 --> 01:02:07,138
Garbage? That's my number one special!

561
01:02:07,239 --> 01:02:10,470
All right!
Get me some more coffee too, will you?

562
01:02:12,110 --> 01:02:15,910
Gee, that's funny.
I've never seen garbage eat garbage before.

563
01:02:24,523 --> 01:02:27,424
Excuse me, sir.
I think you're sitting in my favorite seat.

564
01:02:28,227 --> 01:02:29,694
Come and get it, four-eyes.

565
01:02:34,566 --> 01:02:35,624
Now cool it!

566
01:02:37,502 --> 01:02:38,526
Take it easy.

567
01:02:38,604 --> 01:02:41,266
I just had this joint fixed.
It cost me a fortune.

568
01:02:59,625 --> 01:03:00,614
God!

569
01:03:12,638 --> 01:03:14,367
This order's to go.

570
01:03:22,514 --> 01:03:25,506
I'm terribly sorry about all the damage, sir.

571
01:03:28,754 --> 01:03:30,051
I've been...

572
01:03:30,756 --> 01:03:32,280
...working out.

573
01:03:56,348 --> 01:03:58,179
Good afternoon, Mr. President.

574
01:03:58,483 --> 01:04:00,314
Sorry I've been away so long.

575
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:03,813
I won't let you down again.
