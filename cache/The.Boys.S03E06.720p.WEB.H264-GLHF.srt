1
00:00:20,021 --> 00:00:21,221
With great power

2
00:00:21,222 --> 00:00:22,600
comes the absolute certainty

3
00:00:22,674 --> 00:00:24,233
that you'll turn into a right cunt.

4
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:25,317
We got everything under control.

5
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:29,050
An explosion rocked Midtown Manhattan.

6
00:00:29,051 --> 00:00:30,051
Soldier Boy.

7
00:00:30,114 --> 00:00:32,074
And what you gonna do when you find him?

8
00:00:32,158 --> 00:00:34,118
You need us.

9
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:37,580
You shot up an untested
drug from Vought.

10
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:39,081
Nina.

11
00:00:39,165 --> 00:00:40,875
Our classified lab destroyed...

12
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:41,917
My powers are gone!

13
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:43,377
... three of my contacts disappeared,

14
00:00:43,761 --> 00:00:46,130
so you're the one who pays the debt.

15
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:47,506
Black lives matter!

16
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,341
Supe lives matter, fucking ingrates!

17
00:00:49,425 --> 00:00:50,676
Stop!

18
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,178
Nathan will never walk away.

19
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:54,430
- What the fuck?
- Crimson Countess.

20
00:00:54,513 --> 00:00:56,265
Your lover boy's on his way here.

21
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:58,267
How much did the Russians pay you?

22
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,394
- They didn't.
- I loved you.

23
00:01:00,478 --> 00:01:02,938
I hated you. We all did.

24
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:06,692
You're teaming up with a murderer.

25
00:01:06,776 --> 00:01:08,402
Please don't go.

26
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,627
Past few days have got
me feeling a little, um...

27
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,921
well, philosophical.

28
00:01:19,004 --> 00:01:22,800
Uh, these Supervillain attacks,
they've affected everyone.

29
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:26,470
Doesn't matter who you
are, where you're from.

30
00:01:26,554 --> 00:01:28,264
We're all in this together.

31
00:01:28,347 --> 00:01:32,351
And together, we can
imagine a better world.

32
00:01:34,395 --> 00:01:37,606
♪ Imagine there's no heaven ♪

33
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:41,110

42
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,147
Stop.

43
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,649
Deep.

44
00:02:20,733 --> 00:02:22,860
Is there anyone else that can
operate this thing? Seriously.

45
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:24,403
Ashley thought we should
get rid of most of them.

46
00:02:24,486 --> 00:02:27,197
- What? You fired them.
- Here, I found it. I found it.

47
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:29,283
Okay.

48
00:02:29,366 --> 00:02:30,784
Stop.

49
00:02:31,869 --> 00:02:33,495
Zoom in.

50
00:02:36,582 --> 00:02:38,751
Soldier Boy.

51
00:02:38,834 --> 00:02:40,711
No, that's impossible. He died, like,

52
00:02:40,794 --> 00:02:42,963
- 40 years ago.
- Someone's cosplaying?

53
00:02:43,047 --> 00:02:45,174
Look at his face. It's him.

54
00:02:45,257 --> 00:02:47,551
- Or maybe CGI.
- It is not CGI.

55
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:50,095
You don't even know what CGI stands for.

56
00:02:50,179 --> 00:02:51,472
It stands for "blow me."

57
00:02:51,555 --> 00:02:53,182
I don't understand. Where has he been?

58
00:02:53,265 --> 00:02:54,725
Why did he kill Crimson Countess?

59
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:55,893
I mean, the two were, like, fucking

60
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:57,436
Kurt and Goldie. All
right, you know what?

61
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,730
This is fine. This is fine.
We dominate the news cycle.

62
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:01,106
I will call Haberman.
We'll message that we got

63
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,232
Soldier Boy totally under control.

64
00:03:02,316 --> 00:03:03,859
Shut up.

65
00:03:03,943 --> 00:03:07,196
You want to tell the
world that Soldier Boy,

66
00:03:07,279 --> 00:03:08,781
hero of heroes,

67
00:03:08,864 --> 00:03:10,366
is back from the fucking dead

68
00:03:10,449 --> 00:03:12,034
and blowing up Midtown?

69
00:03:12,117 --> 00:03:13,494
Before me, he was Vought.

70
00:03:13,577 --> 00:03:15,162
His statue's in front of
the fucking building, Ashley.

71
00:03:15,245 --> 00:03:16,622
Oh, my God,

72
00:03:16,705 --> 00:03:19,208
if this gets out...

73
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:20,876
company's fucked. I'm fucked.

74
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,628
Oh, God. If the company falls, I fall.

75
00:03:22,711 --> 00:03:24,088
Oh, fuck.

76
00:03:25,381 --> 00:03:28,509
Oh, God. Why is this happening to me?

77
00:03:28,592 --> 00:03:31,387
This isn't fair.

78
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,430
This is so fucking unfair.

79
00:03:38,394 --> 00:03:39,394
Okay.

80
00:03:39,395 --> 00:03:40,562
I'll handle this.

81
00:03:40,646 --> 00:03:42,690
I'm gonna find him and kill him.

82
00:03:42,773 --> 00:03:44,608
You bury it. All of it.

83
00:03:44,692 --> 00:03:45,734
The footage, no one sees it.

84
00:03:45,818 --> 00:03:47,277
He fucks it up, it's your head.

85
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:48,779
Noir.

86
00:03:52,574 --> 00:03:54,952
Why would he kill Crimson Countess?

87
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:57,871
He was your team leader,
you have any idea?

88
00:04:05,337 --> 00:04:09,008
I'm really glad to have you
with me on this one, pal.

89
00:04:09,091 --> 00:04:12,553
Seriously. You're the
only one I can count on.

90
00:04:40,247 --> 00:04:43,292
Uh... thank you.

91
00:05:03,979 --> 00:05:05,773
What the hell?

92
00:05:07,149 --> 00:05:09,860
Where's the Chop Socky Oriental Sauce?

93
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:11,779
They don't have that anymore.

94
00:05:11,862 --> 00:05:12,862
Why the fuck not?

95
00:05:12,863 --> 00:05:16,450
Uh, many... many good reasons.

96
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:17,534
Did you get the other shit?

97
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:21,288
Here you go, guv.

98
00:05:21,371 --> 00:05:23,165
Oh.

99
00:05:23,248 --> 00:05:25,209
Man, I missed bennies.

100
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:27,127
It's how we won D-Day, you know.

101
00:05:27,211 --> 00:05:29,046
We were wired to the fucking gills.

102
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:34,093
Listen, let's have a little chat

103
00:05:34,176 --> 00:05:36,178
about this team-up, yeah?

104
00:05:36,261 --> 00:05:37,846
Yeah, what the hell
do I need a team for?

105
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,473
The last one handed me to the Reds.

106
00:05:39,556 --> 00:05:42,226
And we got you out
of that little pickle.

107
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:43,894
We wrapped up Crimson Countess

108
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:46,230
and delivered her like a
fucking Christmas turkey,

109
00:05:46,313 --> 00:05:49,066
and I even sorted Gunpowder for you.

110
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:51,443
Why am I supposed to
be impressed with that?

111
00:05:51,527 --> 00:05:53,987
That's like killing Emmanuel Lewis.

112
00:05:55,948 --> 00:05:58,200
Yeah, well, he grew up a
bit since you last saw him.

113
00:05:58,283 --> 00:05:59,868
Hands off the fucking shield.

114
00:05:59,952 --> 00:06:01,203
- Mm.
- Anyway,

115
00:06:01,286 --> 00:06:02,913
you want payback on Payback, don't you?

116
00:06:02,996 --> 00:06:04,998
Well, it just so happens

117
00:06:05,082 --> 00:06:07,251
that we

118
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:10,754
are experts at
exterminating shitbag Supes.

119
00:06:10,838 --> 00:06:13,257
You see, it's a whole different
world out there now, son.

120
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,008
We're here to help you find your way.

121
00:06:15,092 --> 00:06:16,635
Well, I can find them on my own.

122
00:06:16,718 --> 00:06:18,095
Uh, are you sure?

123
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:20,848
I mean, do you know what a GPS is?

124
00:06:20,931 --> 00:06:23,183
Or... or Bluetooth? Or, I mean...

125
00:06:23,267 --> 00:06:24,518
... the internet?

126
00:06:26,937 --> 00:06:28,564
You made those words up.

127
00:06:28,647 --> 00:06:30,858
No. No. No, those are real words, um,

128
00:06:30,941 --> 00:06:32,526
and... and you need those to find them.

129
00:06:32,609 --> 00:06:33,861
All right? You need us.

130
00:06:35,904 --> 00:06:37,197
Kid's right.

131
00:06:37,281 --> 00:06:40,617
And all we ask in return

132
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:44,621
is that you add one
more name to the list.

133
00:06:49,293 --> 00:06:50,502
Who?

134
00:06:50,586 --> 00:06:54,381
A right cunt named Homelander.

135
00:06:55,674 --> 00:06:58,135
I've seen pictures.

136
00:06:58,218 --> 00:06:59,720
Who is he?

137
00:06:59,803 --> 00:07:02,181
He's the new you.

138
00:07:02,264 --> 00:07:04,183
No one's the new me, pal.

139
00:07:06,268 --> 00:07:09,229
But why him?

140
00:07:09,313 --> 00:07:12,441
Let's just say you're not
the only one wants payback.

141
00:07:13,734 --> 00:07:16,653
Hm. Hm.

142
00:07:16,737 --> 00:07:17,863
All right.

143
00:07:17,946 --> 00:07:20,991
You help me find the rest of my team,

144
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:23,952
and I'll help you with this Homelander.

145
00:08:17,381 --> 00:08:19,466
So, you think that Soldier Boy

146
00:08:19,549 --> 00:08:21,301
is going after the rest of Payback?

147
00:08:21,385 --> 00:08:23,637
Countess wasn't strong enough
to fuck him over on her own.

148
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,055
She had help.

149
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:28,225
Soldier Boy's just getting started.

150
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:29,851
Do you know where any of them are?

151
00:08:29,935 --> 00:08:31,186
Those shady-ass TNT Twins

152
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:33,146
got an address in Vermont.

153
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:37,401
- Okay. Does Butcher have it?
- No, but he'll get it.

154
00:08:37,484 --> 00:08:40,153
I think Soldier Boy is bulletproof.

155
00:08:41,405 --> 00:08:43,073
This ain't for Soldier Boy.

156
00:08:46,743 --> 00:08:49,746
Look, I'm pissed at those guys, too,

157
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,623
but we have to keep our heads on.

158
00:08:51,707 --> 00:08:55,085
Why? Why do I always have
to take the high road?

159
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:57,170
You know, when white folks get mad,

160
00:08:57,254 --> 00:08:58,672
y'all motherfuckers go berserk,

161
00:08:58,755 --> 00:09:01,258
but I got to turn the other cheek?

162
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:04,678
Fuck the high road, fuck
Butcher, and fuck Hughie.

163
00:09:04,761 --> 00:09:06,346
Hughie is not himself right now.

164
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:08,640
Hughie is a grown-ass man
that's made his own choices.

165
00:09:08,724 --> 00:09:09,783
M.M.!

166
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:14,146
Please. Soldier Boy is gonna
kill more people. I mean, fuck.

167
00:09:14,229 --> 00:09:15,605
Kimiko is in the hospital.

168
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:17,274
She lost her powers.

169
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:20,485
Frenchie isn't answering, Alex is dead,

170
00:09:20,569 --> 00:09:22,195
and Maeve...

171
00:09:27,826 --> 00:09:29,661
We're all we've got.

172
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,708
It's up to us.

173
00:09:40,756 --> 00:09:43,508
Shit.

174
00:09:43,592 --> 00:09:45,635
This is Starlight.

175
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:48,013
Yeah, of course, Ashley.
I'll be right there.

176
00:09:48,096 --> 00:09:49,890
I got to go up to the
Tower for a little bit.

177
00:09:49,973 --> 00:09:51,266
Now?

178
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:53,185
If I don't go, they're
gonna know something's up.

179
00:09:53,268 --> 00:09:54,936
I'll be one hour.

180
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,982
Do I need to worry about you?

181
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:07,240
Okay.

182
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:10,494
Even the greatest trees

183
00:10:10,577 --> 00:10:12,788
must grow from a single seed.

184
00:10:12,871 --> 00:10:18,168
Follow one proud Black man's
journey to the root of his roots,

185
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:22,422
as he takes the A-Train to Africa.

186
00:10:22,506 --> 00:10:26,093
Jesus fucking Christ.

187
00:10:26,176 --> 00:10:27,219
Hey.

188
00:10:27,302 --> 00:10:29,096
It looks great.

189
00:10:29,179 --> 00:10:31,473
Man, there's so much
strength in dignity.

190
00:10:31,556 --> 00:10:33,934
What are you doing about Blue Hawk?

191
00:10:34,017 --> 00:10:36,144
Okay, first of all, everyone at Vought

192
00:10:36,228 --> 00:10:38,814
is just heartbroken over your
brother's tragic accident.

193
00:10:38,897 --> 00:10:39,940
It wasn't an accident.

194
00:10:40,023 --> 00:10:41,900
Blue Hawk went apeshit for no reason.

195
00:10:41,983 --> 00:10:43,026
Well, he said he felt threatened.

196
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,319
- Threatened?
- Mm-hmm.

197
00:10:44,403 --> 00:10:46,029
By what, a room full of Black people

198
00:10:46,113 --> 00:10:47,280
with no superpowers?

199
00:10:47,364 --> 00:10:48,907
Look, I've scheduled him for 12 weeks

200
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:50,158
of sensitivity training.

201
00:10:50,242 --> 00:10:52,202
Fuck that. I want charges brought.

202
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:54,454
Okay, A-Train, persecuting Blue Hawk

203
00:10:54,538 --> 00:10:56,123
will only make things worse.

204
00:10:56,206 --> 00:10:57,290
This is a time for healing.

205
00:10:57,374 --> 00:10:58,917
I don't give a shit.

206
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,128
I thought we got rid of
the Nazis around here.

207
00:11:01,211 --> 00:11:03,296
Vought rejects racism

208
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,215
- and Nazism unequivocally. Okay?
- Hmm.

209
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:07,008
Now, uh, can we talk about this later?

210
00:11:07,092 --> 00:11:08,677
I have a lot going on today. Thank you.

211
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,763
You know, whatever. I don't need you.

212
00:11:11,847 --> 00:11:14,266
I'll just ping his chip,
go get his ass myself.

213
00:11:14,349 --> 00:11:16,601
No. Homelander wants everyone to present

214
00:11:16,685 --> 00:11:18,270
a united front right now.

215
00:11:18,353 --> 00:11:20,522
My brother is paralyzed.

216
00:11:20,605 --> 00:11:22,357
I want some fucking justice.

217
00:11:22,441 --> 00:11:24,776
Seriously? Justice?

218
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,069
- Yeah.
- You want justice?

219
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:28,155
Yeah.

220
00:11:28,238 --> 00:11:30,240
Oh, fuck.

221
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:32,701
I have spent over 100 hours

222
00:11:32,784 --> 00:11:34,286
in crisis management meetings

223
00:11:34,369 --> 00:11:37,914
specifically figuring out how
to cover up your bullshit...

224
00:11:37,998 --> 00:11:40,250
including all three of
your straight-up murders...

225
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,252
while you were out in
the club with your crew,

226
00:11:42,335 --> 00:11:44,379
or getting your toe sucked by Popclaw,

227
00:11:44,463 --> 00:11:47,090
who, let's not forget,
you also murdered.

228
00:11:47,174 --> 00:11:49,885
Yeah, that's right. I know about that.

229
00:11:49,968 --> 00:11:51,136
You did not give a shit

230
00:11:51,219 --> 00:11:52,971
about all the collateral
you caused then.

231
00:11:53,054 --> 00:11:55,140
Now, all of a sudden, you care

232
00:11:55,223 --> 00:11:58,477
because it happened to you?

233
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,812
Go fuck yourself.

234
00:12:00,896 --> 00:12:03,648
Yeah, that's right.

235
00:12:03,732 --> 00:12:05,650
I said that.

236
00:12:05,734 --> 00:12:09,696
Out loud.

237
00:12:19,748 --> 00:12:21,833
Homelander.

238
00:12:21,917 --> 00:12:23,752
- What?
- Couple things. Uh...

239
00:12:23,835 --> 00:12:26,963
Noir, he's, uh, he's gone.

240
00:12:28,507 --> 00:12:29,841
What do you mean, he's gone?

241
00:12:29,925 --> 00:12:31,551
He cut out his tracking chip.

242
00:12:39,267 --> 00:12:41,144
No, he... he... he...

243
00:12:43,146 --> 00:12:46,733
He... he wouldn't. Not
Noir. He wouldn't run.

244
00:12:48,109 --> 00:12:49,694
Well...

245
00:12:49,778 --> 00:12:51,947
He wouldn't do that to me.

246
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,740
He w... he wouldn't run.

247
00:12:55,325 --> 00:12:58,245
Tell him... what we figured out.

248
00:12:58,328 --> 00:12:59,663
Right.

249
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:01,498
We think Crimson Countess
was just the start.

250
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:03,124
We think... he's going after

251
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:04,751
his whole team, including Noir.

252
00:13:04,834 --> 00:13:06,169
The good news is, that means we know

253
00:13:06,253 --> 00:13:08,255
where he's probably headed next.

254
00:13:08,338 --> 00:13:10,340
The twins. TNT.

255
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:12,592
They're the closest. Vermont.

256
00:13:16,137 --> 00:13:17,973
Okay.

257
00:13:18,056 --> 00:13:20,684
Okay? Really? Homelander,
thank you so much.

258
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,561
Shh, shh, shh.

259
00:13:25,981 --> 00:13:28,149
You go there,

260
00:13:28,233 --> 00:13:29,651
and you check it out.

261
00:13:29,734 --> 00:13:33,321
- Yeah.
- And if Soldier Boy does show up,

262
00:13:33,405 --> 00:13:36,366
then, uh...

263
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:37,993
- you call me.
- Yeah.

264
00:13:38,076 --> 00:13:39,661
Uh...

265
00:13:39,744 --> 00:13:42,080
- what should I tell the twins?
- I don't give a fuck.

266
00:13:42,163 --> 00:13:43,915
Got it.

267
00:13:43,999 --> 00:13:45,917
Babe, that was amazing.

268
00:13:46,001 --> 00:13:47,752
Yeah, but, you know, I didn't
need you to jump in there

269
00:13:47,836 --> 00:13:49,254
like that. I had the whole thing.

270
00:13:49,337 --> 00:13:51,047
Hey, hey.

271
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:52,966
I'm just trying to help. Okay?

272
00:13:53,049 --> 00:13:55,552
We're in this together, right?

273
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:57,220
Okay. Right.

274
00:13:57,304 --> 00:13:59,347
Right.

275
00:14:18,033 --> 00:14:20,952
Why the long face, tiger?

276
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:26,249
What if I can't handle him?

277
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,918
I mean, if Noir ran...

278
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:31,504
Oh, you can handle him.

279
00:14:31,588 --> 00:14:34,090
You're the top of the food chain.

280
00:14:34,174 --> 00:14:36,676
Hey, hey.

281
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,012
When we were kids,

282
00:14:39,095 --> 00:14:41,097
alone in the bad room,

283
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:44,267
I got us through it, right?

284
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:45,560
Don't I always?

285
00:14:46,811 --> 00:14:48,688
- Always.
- No matter what.

286
00:14:48,772 --> 00:14:49,772
No matter what.

287
00:14:49,773 --> 00:14:52,484
And now, I'll get us through this.

288
00:14:52,567 --> 00:14:55,862
Just as long as you
and me stick together.

289
00:14:55,945 --> 00:14:58,782
But... what if Edgar's right?

290
00:14:58,865 --> 00:15:02,285
What if it was a mistake
to take over Vought?

291
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:04,579
And... and...

292
00:15:04,663 --> 00:15:07,248
and I am just talent, and
they all know I'm a fraud.

293
00:15:07,332 --> 00:15:09,918
What do you care what a
bunch of mud people think?

294
00:15:11,294 --> 00:15:12,796
Come on.

295
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:15,548
Tell me the real reason.
I want to hear you say it.

296
00:15:16,925 --> 00:15:19,636
- Say it!
- I want them to love me.

297
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:20,970
Yahtzee!

298
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:24,849
Only it never seems
to work out, does it?

299
00:15:24,933 --> 00:15:28,019
Madelyn, Maeve, Stormfront,

300
00:15:28,103 --> 00:15:29,729
even your own son.

301
00:15:29,813 --> 00:15:35,110
So why do you keep running
headfirst into the same brick wall?

302
00:15:40,782 --> 00:15:42,033
I don't know.

303
00:15:42,117 --> 00:15:44,077
Pants on fire. You know.

304
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,121
It's because, deep down,

305
00:15:46,204 --> 00:15:49,332
there's a part of you that is still...

306
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:50,500
human.

307
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,711
- No.
- Mm-hmm. Part of you is.

308
00:15:52,794 --> 00:15:55,255
- Mm-mm.
- A dirty, shriveled,

309
00:15:55,338 --> 00:15:56,506
anemic little part of you

310
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:59,551
that still mewls for approval, and love,

311
00:15:59,634 --> 00:16:03,054
and a mommy, and a
daddy, and a boo-hoo-hoo.

312
00:16:03,138 --> 00:16:06,141
Look at me, tiger.

313
00:16:06,224 --> 00:16:08,643
Look at me.

314
00:16:08,727 --> 00:16:12,522
We got to cut that part
of you out like a cancer.

315
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:15,191
And then, well,

316
00:16:15,275 --> 00:16:17,444
then, my boy, you can finally be

317
00:16:17,527 --> 00:16:20,780
who you were always meant to be.

318
00:16:20,864 --> 00:16:23,616
Pure. Clean.

319
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:26,745
Like marble.

320
00:16:28,663 --> 00:16:33,501
These people would rather
die than be Soviet slaves.

321
00:16:33,585 --> 00:16:35,587
It's too late.

322
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:38,006
Afghanistan is ours.

323
00:16:38,089 --> 00:16:40,717
Wrong. It's free.

324
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,305
And I'll stand by our mujahideen
brothers until the end.

325
00:16:45,388 --> 00:16:46,931
You know what else I'll do?

326
00:16:47,015 --> 00:16:49,100
What?

327
00:16:49,184 --> 00:16:51,686
I'll distract you.

328
00:16:54,189 --> 00:16:56,733
TNT! Detonate!

329
00:17:01,029 --> 00:17:03,323
These fucking twins.

330
00:17:03,406 --> 00:17:05,241
You know they couldn't
hit their fucking marks?

331
00:17:05,325 --> 00:17:08,203
Fucking unprofessionals
is what they are.

332
00:17:08,286 --> 00:17:11,039
Hey, uh, yeah, Butcher's
gonna find them.

333
00:17:11,122 --> 00:17:12,832
Why don't you, uh, why
don't you get some sleep?

334
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:15,502
Mm, no. I've slept enough.

335
00:17:17,253 --> 00:17:18,463
Dads. We know

336
00:17:18,463 --> 00:17:19,964
you love taking your babies everywhere.

337
00:17:20,048 --> 00:17:22,175
No matter where you
go, Starlight Diapers...

338
00:17:22,258 --> 00:17:24,010
Do men really walk around like that?

339
00:17:24,093 --> 00:17:26,721
Yeah. I mean, dads do.

340
00:17:26,805 --> 00:17:28,223
Okay, well...

341
00:17:28,306 --> 00:17:30,934
Bill Cosby is America's dad, and,

342
00:17:31,017 --> 00:17:34,020
tell you one thing, he wouldn't
be caught dead in that pussy gear.

343
00:17:34,103 --> 00:17:35,730
Lot to unpack there. Uh...

344
00:17:35,814 --> 00:17:37,649
The Cos. That's a real man.

345
00:17:37,732 --> 00:17:39,108
Holy shit,

346
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:41,194
did he make some strong drinks.

347
00:17:41,277 --> 00:17:42,737
Holy fucking shit.

348
00:17:42,821 --> 00:17:45,865
But, seriously, what
passes as a man today?

349
00:17:45,949 --> 00:17:47,534
Christ on a cross.

350
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:53,081
I read that we were
ass up in Afghanistan.

351
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:57,335
The fuck is up with that?
Those were the good guys.

352
00:17:57,418 --> 00:17:59,170
- I mean, when I left, it was, uh...
- Yeah, you know...

353
00:17:59,254 --> 00:18:02,715
I mean, goddamn it. We... we
were ten and one, you know?

354
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,051
I lead the 116th onto Omaha Beach.

355
00:18:05,134 --> 00:18:07,303
I was in the fucking Eagle's Nest.

356
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:09,013
I fought for this country.

357
00:18:12,016 --> 00:18:15,103
I fought for this country.

358
00:18:15,186 --> 00:18:16,980
And what did I get for it?

359
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:20,441
Forgotten.

360
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:26,573
Left to rot by my own team.

361
00:18:35,999 --> 00:18:38,877
You know, I wanted
some rug rats of my own,

362
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,421
with Countess. Yeah.

363
00:18:41,504 --> 00:18:42,839
Ain't that a bitch.

364
00:18:42,922 --> 00:18:45,425
You know, couple of
little boys. Raise them up

365
00:18:45,508 --> 00:18:47,969
to be men.

366
00:18:48,052 --> 00:18:50,513
Now...

367
00:18:50,597 --> 00:18:53,850
... now I got nothing.

368
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:57,186
Hey, um, can I ask you something?

369
00:18:59,564 --> 00:19:01,774
What happened in Midtown?

370
00:19:05,069 --> 00:19:06,613
I don't know.

371
00:19:06,696 --> 00:19:08,072
I mean, your team wasn't there,

372
00:19:08,156 --> 00:19:09,324
so did someone do anything,
or say something...

373
00:19:09,407 --> 00:19:11,951
- I said I don't know.
- Okay. Okay, yeah.

374
00:19:19,667 --> 00:19:21,419
I blacked out.

375
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:27,717
About ten minutes.

376
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,054
When I came to, the damage was done.

377
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:36,267
I didn't mean to hurt those people.

378
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:41,314
I'm not a bad guy.

379
00:19:42,732 --> 00:19:45,485
But that won't happen again...

380
00:19:45,568 --> 00:19:47,111
right?

381
00:19:48,488 --> 00:19:50,490
Only if they got it coming.

382
00:19:53,743 --> 00:19:55,161
Oi, oi.

383
00:19:57,538 --> 00:19:59,165
You're bleeding.

384
00:19:59,248 --> 00:20:02,126
Not mine. Got an address.

385
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:04,420
We're off to Vermont.

386
00:20:21,688 --> 00:20:24,565
Lord of the Seven Seas. Wow.

387
00:20:24,649 --> 00:20:26,609
My man, I'm such an incredible fan.

388
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:30,154
Jesus, Tommy. Slather his balls
in peanut butter, why don't you?

389
00:20:30,238 --> 00:20:32,657
Sorry. My sister's a goddamn bitch.

390
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,575
And, uh, TNT.

391
00:20:34,659 --> 00:20:36,911
Right. I'm a big fan of yours, too.

392
00:20:36,995 --> 00:20:38,454
Cool outfits.

393
00:20:38,538 --> 00:20:39,998
Always felt you got railroaded

394
00:20:40,081 --> 00:20:41,749
with that Starlight thing, by the way.

395
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,251
You know, like, what,

396
00:20:43,334 --> 00:20:45,461
nowadays, you can't even
pay a lady a compliment.

397
00:20:45,545 --> 00:20:47,797
- I know, right?
- You're disgusting.

398
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,925
Anyway, we are just
so pleased, you know,

399
00:20:51,009 --> 00:20:52,593
have a big star such as yourself

400
00:20:52,677 --> 00:20:54,887
grace our humble soiree.

401
00:20:54,971 --> 00:20:56,931
You guys having a party?

402
00:21:02,854 --> 00:21:04,564
Wait, is this... ?

403
00:21:06,858 --> 00:21:09,527
This is Herogasm.

404
00:21:27,003 --> 00:21:29,589
I'm really glad you're here.

405
00:21:29,672 --> 00:21:31,883
I missed you.

406
00:21:39,682 --> 00:21:42,226
- Who's joining us?
- They didn't tell you?

407
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,978
Hey, there.

408
00:21:44,979 --> 00:21:48,649
Hey, lady.

409
00:21:51,986 --> 00:21:53,112
The mayor can say anything she wants,

410
00:21:53,196 --> 00:21:54,864
but Homelander is the one working

411
00:21:54,947 --> 00:21:56,240
- to catch the guy.
- Mm.

412
00:21:56,324 --> 00:21:58,242
We're about to turn a corner here.

413
00:21:58,326 --> 00:21:59,786
Absolutely, we are.

414
00:21:59,869 --> 00:22:01,496
- Thank you, honey.
- Of course, sweetheart.

415
00:22:01,579 --> 00:22:03,748
That's reassuring.

416
00:22:03,831 --> 00:22:07,210
But there are 19 dead
and dozens wounded.

417
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:08,920
Congresswoman Neuman,

418
00:22:09,003 --> 00:22:11,798
what do you say to the Americans
who are watching right now

419
00:22:11,881 --> 00:22:14,092
- and feeling scared?
- Yeah, look, it's understandable...

420
00:22:14,175 --> 00:22:16,135
What kind of a... a
nasty question is that?

421
00:22:16,219 --> 00:22:17,845
Oh, no, it's fine.
I'm happy to answer...

422
00:22:17,929 --> 00:22:20,306
Starlight just said, and I keep saying,

423
00:22:20,389 --> 00:22:22,225
this is not a problem.

424
00:22:22,308 --> 00:22:24,060
I'm sorry, sir, I didn't mean...

425
00:22:24,143 --> 00:22:25,853
I don't have time for
your mediocre ambush.

426
00:22:25,937 --> 00:22:28,064
Your job is to report facts,

427
00:22:28,147 --> 00:22:30,525
not attack us when we sit
here and tell you the truth.

428
00:22:30,608 --> 00:22:33,319
The American people, they know.

429
00:22:33,402 --> 00:22:35,530
They know when someone's
telling them facts,

430
00:22:35,613 --> 00:22:38,032
and they know when the
media is lying to them.

431
00:22:38,116 --> 00:22:40,076
There is no problem.

432
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,787
It is safe to go out. Period.

433
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:45,581
You know what? We're done here.

434
00:22:45,665 --> 00:22:49,168
Stupid fucking hack.

435
00:22:49,252 --> 00:22:53,214
Up next, Chuck makes
empanadas with Rachel Ray.

436
00:22:53,297 --> 00:22:54,924
We'll be right back.

437
00:22:55,007 --> 00:22:56,259
And we're clear.

438
00:22:56,342 --> 00:22:57,760
You fucking amateur. The next report

439
00:22:57,844 --> 00:23:00,096
you're gonna be doing is
inside my fucking asshole,

440
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:01,305
you piece of shit.

441
00:23:01,389 --> 00:23:03,182
Hey, uh, you free for a little catch-up?

442
00:23:03,266 --> 00:23:06,144
You know what? I'm... I'm
a little slammed right now.

443
00:23:06,227 --> 00:23:09,689
Oh, come on. Ten minutes won't kill you.

444
00:23:16,863 --> 00:23:19,073
Hey, so, uh, where's Hughie?

445
00:23:19,157 --> 00:23:22,243
Oh, he's just camping with
his dad for a couple of days.

446
00:23:22,326 --> 00:23:25,705
Okay. Okay, good.

447
00:23:25,788 --> 00:23:27,248
Oh, great. I thought he was avoiding me

448
00:23:27,331 --> 00:23:28,541
- or something, you know...
- No, no.

449
00:23:28,624 --> 00:23:30,501
... 'cause he was scared
I was gonna pop his head.

450
00:23:32,461 --> 00:23:33,588
Hmm?

451
00:23:33,671 --> 00:23:35,298
Come on, Annie.

452
00:23:36,757 --> 00:23:38,050
Put them away.

453
00:23:38,134 --> 00:23:40,052
I'm not gonna hurt you

454
00:23:40,136 --> 00:23:42,013
or Hughie or your families.

455
00:23:42,096 --> 00:23:44,265
Besides, you'd lose.

456
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:47,185
Then why are you here?

457
00:23:47,268 --> 00:23:48,853
Because I want to help you.

458
00:23:48,936 --> 00:23:52,148
Huh. Help.

459
00:23:52,231 --> 00:23:54,692
From the psycho who blew up Congress.

460
00:23:54,775 --> 00:23:57,069
Look, most of those guys
passed around deepfakes of me

461
00:23:57,153 --> 00:23:59,113
on the House floor blowing bin Laden,

462
00:23:59,197 --> 00:24:01,199
so I'm not exactly
overwhelmed with sympathy.

463
00:24:02,867 --> 00:24:04,785
Annie, you need me.

464
00:24:04,869 --> 00:24:06,329
You're all alone.

465
00:24:06,412 --> 00:24:08,456
I mean, come on, that
"hashtag Homelight" shit?

466
00:24:08,539 --> 00:24:10,416
That looks like you're
in a hostage video.

467
00:24:10,499 --> 00:24:11,709
Blink twice if I'm wrong.

468
00:24:11,792 --> 00:24:13,377
And, what, you got to
play nice with the guy

469
00:24:13,461 --> 00:24:14,879
that throat-fucked you
on your first day of work.

470
00:24:14,962 --> 00:24:18,966
And Maeve, they say Maeve is in rehab,

471
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:22,136
but you and I both know
she's probably dead.

472
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,638
I'm all you got.

473
00:24:23,721 --> 00:24:26,641
Come on, Annie, you and I were friends.

474
00:24:26,724 --> 00:24:28,517
None of that has changed for me.

475
00:24:28,601 --> 00:24:30,186
Are you ever gonna get to the point?

476
00:24:32,396 --> 00:24:34,774
You have 193 million
Instagram followers.

477
00:24:34,857 --> 00:24:37,109
Lend me your influence,
and I'll lend you mine.

478
00:24:37,193 --> 00:24:39,111
I can protect you from Homelander.

479
00:24:39,195 --> 00:24:41,989
You'll finally be team captain for real.

480
00:24:42,073 --> 00:24:43,866
And in return, you help
me goose my numbers.

481
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:46,994
I can finally get my
education reform bill passed.

482
00:24:47,078 --> 00:24:48,913
We can make things better, Annie.

483
00:24:48,996 --> 00:24:51,123
For my daughter,

484
00:24:51,207 --> 00:24:52,959
for a lot of daughters.

485
00:24:54,752 --> 00:24:57,922
Come on, what do you say?

486
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,719
You're right.

487
00:25:07,598 --> 00:25:11,143
This whole place.

488
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:14,188
I'm so fucking tired...

489
00:25:16,983 --> 00:25:19,235
... of listening to people tell me

490
00:25:19,318 --> 00:25:22,321
I need to be shitty in order to win.

491
00:25:24,156 --> 00:25:26,284
Fuck you.

492
00:25:26,367 --> 00:25:29,453
And fuck Homelander, and fuck Vought

493
00:25:29,537 --> 00:25:32,623
and this "whatever it takes" crap.

494
00:25:32,707 --> 00:25:33,874
You're just gonna end up

495
00:25:33,958 --> 00:25:37,128
sitting on top of the
steaming pile of shit

496
00:25:37,211 --> 00:25:39,463
that you built.

497
00:25:39,547 --> 00:25:41,382
I'm done.

498
00:25:41,465 --> 00:25:44,593
I'm fucking done. I'm
not doing it anymore.

499
00:25:44,677 --> 00:25:46,178
You're not gonna be doing anything

500
00:25:46,262 --> 00:25:47,346
if Homelander kills you.

501
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:48,889
Yeah, maybe.

502
00:25:48,973 --> 00:25:52,143
But then I'll know I'm not
working with a fucking nutjob.

503
00:25:52,226 --> 00:25:54,937
So, either pop my head

504
00:25:55,021 --> 00:25:57,189
or get the hell out.

505
00:26:14,373 --> 00:26:16,083
Hey, keep this between us?

506
00:26:16,167 --> 00:26:19,712
It'd be really tough to take
out America's sweetheart,

507
00:26:19,795 --> 00:26:22,131
but not impossible.

508
00:26:54,663 --> 00:26:56,540
I'm so sorry.

509
00:27:02,046 --> 00:27:03,172
No.

510
00:27:10,763 --> 00:27:16,560
No. S'il vous plaît, no. Don't do this.

511
00:27:16,644 --> 00:27:19,021
His body is a masterpiece, no?

512
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:27,488
Do you know the story behind this one?

513
00:27:27,571 --> 00:27:30,991
Oh, years ago, my cousin
Kolya went State's witness, so

514
00:27:31,075 --> 00:27:32,625
I send my Sergei.

515
00:27:32,826 --> 00:27:36,080
Not even three bullets
could stop my attack dog.

516
00:27:37,415 --> 00:27:41,335
Bar fight on the Basque coast.

517
00:27:41,419 --> 00:27:43,170
He started it.

518
00:27:43,254 --> 00:27:46,382
Oh, my beast. This is my favorite.

519
00:27:47,925 --> 00:27:52,096
When Sergei was 14 years
old, he dropped a glass.

520
00:27:52,179 --> 00:27:55,099
His father told him
to kneel in the shards

521
00:27:55,182 --> 00:27:57,351
and not move until he said so.

522
00:27:57,435 --> 00:28:01,939
Little Sergei did not shift an inch,

523
00:28:02,022 --> 00:28:04,150
not even after his
father left to get drunk

524
00:28:04,233 --> 00:28:06,110
and pass out in the whorehouse.

525
00:28:07,862 --> 00:28:10,030
Oh, please, don't cry for Sergei.

526
00:28:10,114 --> 00:28:12,158
He likes to be told what to do.

527
00:28:12,241 --> 00:28:16,328
And he loves to be
punished when he's bad.

528
00:28:16,412 --> 00:28:17,955
Makes him hard.

529
00:28:19,498 --> 00:28:20,499
No.

530
00:28:20,583 --> 00:28:22,251
So... Cherie...

531
00:28:22,334 --> 00:28:23,334
- No.
- ... or Kimiko?

532
00:28:23,377 --> 00:28:25,254
No, don't do it.

533
00:28:25,337 --> 00:28:27,506
Don't do this! Nina!

534
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:28,591
You must choose, Sergei.

535
00:28:28,674 --> 00:28:29,925
If not, I will kill

536
00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:31,760
both of them, and when you've finished

537
00:28:31,844 --> 00:28:34,263
screaming, crying, I will kill you, too.

538
00:28:41,061 --> 00:28:42,605
- Choose.
- No.

539
00:28:48,402 --> 00:28:49,487
Fuck.

540
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:02,666
No.

541
00:29:23,854 --> 00:29:25,189
Kimiko, run!

542
00:29:32,196 --> 00:29:33,697
Kimiko!

543
00:29:34,515 --> 00:29:35,533
No!

544
00:29:57,263 --> 00:30:00,182
Oh, fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

545
00:30:15,197 --> 00:30:17,157
Mon cœur.

546
00:30:17,241 --> 00:30:19,743
Mon cœur.

547
00:30:19,827 --> 00:30:21,537
She's gone.

548
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:24,456
Nina's gone.

549
00:30:26,584 --> 00:30:28,252
It's over.

550
00:30:28,335 --> 00:30:31,046
It's over.

551
00:30:39,513 --> 00:30:42,224
Have you always had that?

552
00:30:44,435 --> 00:30:45,811
I don't know what you're talking about.

553
00:30:51,275 --> 00:30:53,819
I grew up in Harlem,

554
00:30:53,902 --> 00:30:56,238
brownstone filled with family.

555
00:30:56,322 --> 00:30:59,283
Grandparents, uncles, aunts, cousins.

556
00:30:59,366 --> 00:31:01,535
One night,

557
00:31:01,619 --> 00:31:03,454
there was a ruckus outside.

558
00:31:03,537 --> 00:31:06,832
I looked out the window,
and it was Soldier Boy.

559
00:31:06,915 --> 00:31:08,876
He had pulled up on some
kids that were trying

560
00:31:08,959 --> 00:31:12,755
to boost a Benz, and so I
run and wake up my granddad.

561
00:31:12,838 --> 00:31:16,175
"Grandpa, Grandpa. It's
Soldier Boy. Come look."

562
00:31:16,258 --> 00:31:18,802
Soldier Boy takes the Benz,

563
00:31:18,886 --> 00:31:20,721
and he hurls it through our house,

564
00:31:20,804 --> 00:31:22,640
like a fucking freight train.

565
00:31:22,723 --> 00:31:25,434
It missed me by about six inches.

566
00:31:25,517 --> 00:31:28,228
And my grandpa...

567
00:31:28,312 --> 00:31:30,147
One minute he was there...

568
00:31:32,566 --> 00:31:34,568
... and then he wasn't.

569
00:31:36,195 --> 00:31:38,155
And I woke him up.

570
00:31:38,238 --> 00:31:40,115
I put him in that spot.

571
00:31:41,325 --> 00:31:43,619
That is not your fault.

572
00:31:43,702 --> 00:31:45,496
That's when this whole OCD shit started.

573
00:31:45,579 --> 00:31:46,997
I mean, I don't understand it.

574
00:31:47,081 --> 00:31:49,124
All I know is that if I
didn't check the burners

575
00:31:49,208 --> 00:31:50,584
three times a night,

576
00:31:50,668 --> 00:31:52,795
Soldier Boy would come back
and kill the rest of us.

577
00:31:55,881 --> 00:31:57,716
And I'm still that kid.

578
00:32:00,344 --> 00:32:02,137
Still getting up in
the middle of the night,

579
00:32:02,221 --> 00:32:05,182
checking the burners.

580
00:32:05,265 --> 00:32:07,976
'Cause if I don't,

581
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:11,522
Soldier Boy's gonna come back,

582
00:32:11,605 --> 00:32:13,857
and he's gonna kill my family.

583
00:32:18,028 --> 00:32:22,408
I got to get this
motherfucker out of my head,

584
00:32:22,491 --> 00:32:25,327
and end this.

585
00:32:25,411 --> 00:32:27,621
Or it'll end me.

586
00:32:40,008 --> 00:32:43,011
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Oh, hell nah.

587
00:32:43,095 --> 00:32:45,139
- Oh, my God.
- Invitation?

588
00:32:45,222 --> 00:32:46,598
I got your invitation right here.

589
00:32:46,682 --> 00:32:48,100
Hey.

590
00:32:48,183 --> 00:32:51,270
Starlight. I did not even recognize you.

591
00:32:51,353 --> 00:32:53,981
Come in. You are more
than welcome to party.

592
00:32:54,064 --> 00:32:55,315
- Party?
- Yeah.

593
00:32:55,399 --> 00:32:57,776
The 70th anniversary of Herogasm.

594
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,611
- Fuck me.
- Oh.

595
00:33:00,654 --> 00:33:02,156
- Oh, shit.
- Fuck.

596
00:33:02,239 --> 00:33:03,323
You seem familiar.

597
00:33:03,407 --> 00:33:05,367
You about to get
familiar with these hands

598
00:33:05,451 --> 00:33:07,536
if you don't get this
motherfucking love sausage

599
00:33:07,619 --> 00:33:09,288
away from my goddamn face.

600
00:33:09,371 --> 00:33:12,750
- Okay, okay, okay.
- You are not Supe.

601
00:33:12,833 --> 00:33:14,418
I'm with her.

602
00:33:14,501 --> 00:33:15,961
For the fuck party.

603
00:33:16,044 --> 00:33:19,640
Yeah. Um, mm-hmm. No, he's
very good at cunnilingus.

604
00:33:19,641 --> 00:33:21,967
- Yeah, his tongue is just... Yeah.
- Oh, yeah?

605
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:24,261
He just gobbles that vagina right up.

606
00:33:24,344 --> 00:33:25,929
Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.

607
00:33:26,013 --> 00:33:28,390
- Mm-hmm.
- Love Sausage, huh?

608
00:33:28,474 --> 00:33:30,017
This is good name for me.

609
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,770
I like it. Come on in.

610
00:33:41,487 --> 00:33:43,739
Oh, my God.

611
00:33:48,327 --> 00:33:50,162
Oh...

612
00:33:50,245 --> 00:33:53,332
All right, so once a
year, a bunch of C-listers

613
00:33:53,415 --> 00:33:55,125
get together at one of their places

614
00:33:55,209 --> 00:33:56,802
to get they wicks wet.

615
00:33:56,885 --> 00:33:57,961
Stop.

616
00:33:57,961 --> 00:33:59,338
- Herogasm.
- Mm-hmm.

617
00:33:59,421 --> 00:34:02,049
- I get it.
- Holy ass-ramming.

618
00:34:02,132 --> 00:34:03,217
Ew.

619
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,301
Aw, stop!

620
00:34:04,384 --> 00:34:06,678
Holy ass-ramming. Holy ass-ramming.

621
00:34:11,266 --> 00:34:14,645
Come on. Come on my hump.

622
00:34:14,728 --> 00:34:16,104
That's it.

623
00:34:18,065 --> 00:34:20,150
Poor Frenchie.

624
00:34:20,234 --> 00:34:23,111
He's always wanted to see
this. He's gonna be heartbroken.

625
00:34:27,274 --> 00:34:29,670
- You know what's fucked up?
- Hmm?

626
00:34:29,671 --> 00:34:31,912
It's that it's real
fucking sex workers here

627
00:34:31,995 --> 00:34:34,540
getting banged up, and
not in the good way.

628
00:34:35,916 --> 00:34:37,459
Not that these Supes give a shit.

629
00:34:37,543 --> 00:34:39,461
When Soldier Boy gets here,

630
00:34:39,545 --> 00:34:40,921
it's gonna be a slaughter.

631
00:34:41,004 --> 00:34:43,131
We have to get these people out.

632
00:34:45,259 --> 00:34:47,052
What up, bro?

633
00:34:47,135 --> 00:34:49,263
What the fuck did this motherfucker

634
00:34:49,346 --> 00:34:50,973
- put on my jacket?
- Oh, my God. Okay. Um...

635
00:34:51,056 --> 00:34:52,391
It's my favorite fucking jacket.

636
00:34:52,474 --> 00:34:53,892
- Let's go find a bathroom.
- Some nasty-ass shit.

637
00:34:53,976 --> 00:34:55,519
- Let's go find a bathroom.
- This shit is sticky.

638
00:34:55,602 --> 00:34:56,979
Let's go clean it up. Let's go.

639
00:34:57,062 --> 00:34:58,897
- What the fuck is this shit?
- Yellowtail sashimi?

640
00:34:58,981 --> 00:35:01,942
No. No, not in the
mood for that. Thanks.

641
00:35:02,025 --> 00:35:03,485
- Goddamn it.
- Throwing ropes.

642
00:35:04,778 --> 00:35:06,947
Oh, shit.

643
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:09,867
Lick it up, you yummy brown bear.

644
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,706
I can't.

645
00:35:15,789 --> 00:35:18,417
I need a bathroom.

646
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,127
Right now.

647
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:23,422
Oh, okay. So, this...
this is an actual orgy.

648
00:35:23,505 --> 00:35:24,798
That's what this is.

649
00:35:24,882 --> 00:35:26,383
Fucking Herogasm.

650
00:35:28,135 --> 00:35:29,386
Still a thing, eh?

651
00:35:29,469 --> 00:35:33,223
It's my thing. I founded it in '52.

652
00:35:33,307 --> 00:35:35,017
Me and this other Supe, Liberty.

653
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,019
Man, was she a firecracker.

654
00:35:38,478 --> 00:35:42,065
Frenchie's gonna be
heartbroken he missed this.

655
00:35:42,149 --> 00:35:45,027
There are a lot of people in there.

656
00:35:47,946 --> 00:35:50,616
Well, as long as they stay
out of my way, they'll be fine.

657
00:35:52,117 --> 00:35:54,953
Okay, all right. Just,
uh, give me three minutes.

658
00:35:55,037 --> 00:35:56,079
I'll jump in, I'll jump back out.

659
00:35:56,163 --> 00:35:57,550
I'll tell you exactly
where to find the twins.

660
00:35:57,551 --> 00:35:59,458
Nobody else in your way.

661
00:35:59,541 --> 00:36:01,335
Three minutes.

662
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:07,049
Soldier Boy? Nah, he's dead as dog shit.

663
00:36:07,132 --> 00:36:08,884
No, he's not.

664
00:36:08,967 --> 00:36:11,595
I swear, this is really happening.

665
00:36:11,678 --> 00:36:14,765
Please, you need to help me
get people out of here, now.

666
00:36:14,848 --> 00:36:17,434
Starlight, come on.

667
00:36:17,517 --> 00:36:19,519
Do not let them do this to you.

668
00:36:19,603 --> 00:36:21,271
This... this fear.

669
00:36:21,355 --> 00:36:23,148
You heard what Homelander said.

670
00:36:23,231 --> 00:36:26,568
Lamestream media's making a
fucking mountain out of a molehill.

671
00:36:26,652 --> 00:36:28,487
- Do the research.
- Oh, my God.

672
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:29,780
This is real.

673
00:36:29,863 --> 00:36:32,074
These attacks are real.

674
00:36:32,157 --> 00:36:34,368
Soldier Boy is real.

675
00:36:34,451 --> 00:36:38,497
Well, I just think you could stand
to be a little better informed.

676
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:41,041
Homelander's gonna
take care of it, okay?

677
00:36:42,292 --> 00:36:44,878
I'm gonna go find a salad to toss.

678
00:36:44,962 --> 00:36:46,171
Excuse me.

679
00:36:52,094 --> 00:36:54,429
You melted my cock ring.

680
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:00,978
Oh, Jesus, your stretching powers!

681
00:37:04,648 --> 00:37:07,567
Oh, my God, your mouth is amazing.

682
00:37:07,651 --> 00:37:09,403
It's like a velvet
vacuum draining my balls.

683
00:37:09,486 --> 00:37:11,655
Oh, yeah. You are so fucking hot.

684
00:37:11,697 --> 00:37:13,573
Oh...

685
00:37:13,657 --> 00:37:16,702
God, your legs go on for days.

686
00:37:19,538 --> 00:37:22,708
Ooh. Ooh. Oh, my God.

687
00:37:22,791 --> 00:37:25,043
- What the fuck?
- Shit.

688
00:37:25,127 --> 00:37:26,211
It's not what it looks like.

689
00:37:26,294 --> 00:37:28,046
What are you doing here?

690
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:29,455
Nothing. I'm not doing
anything. Why would you even...

691
00:37:29,506 --> 00:37:31,675
This octopus was sick.
Why would you ask that?

692
00:37:31,758 --> 00:37:33,619
- Homelander is gonna love this.
- No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

693
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:35,721
Please, please, please.
Stop. Stop, stop, stop. No.

694
00:37:35,804 --> 00:37:38,223
Okay. Okay, okay, okay. Look.

695
00:37:38,306 --> 00:37:40,892
That's why I'm here. It's his idea.

696
00:37:43,437 --> 00:37:45,063
What's his idea?

697
00:37:47,065 --> 00:37:50,152
I said no cameras in the toilets, Tommy.

698
00:37:50,235 --> 00:37:52,487
- Give it back.
- You're pathetic.

699
00:37:52,571 --> 00:37:53,822
You know what?

700
00:37:53,905 --> 00:37:57,284
Let's see how everyone
feels about close-ups

701
00:37:57,367 --> 00:38:00,162
of their assholes without consent!

702
00:38:00,245 --> 00:38:01,455
Fuck you. I'm done.

703
00:38:01,538 --> 00:38:04,207
I never want to see you again.

704
00:38:07,335 --> 00:38:09,296
Oh. That's so sweet.

705
00:38:09,379 --> 00:38:12,174
Uh, just, I got to give
my asshole a breather.

706
00:38:12,257 --> 00:38:13,800
You know?

707
00:38:13,884 --> 00:38:16,303
Then say goodbye to that
Westfield mall opening

708
00:38:16,386 --> 00:38:18,722
next week in Poughkeepsie, 'cause nobody

709
00:38:18,805 --> 00:38:21,433
is coming to see you without me.

710
00:38:21,516 --> 00:38:24,104
I fucking hate you. I hate your mouth.

711
00:38:24,105 --> 00:38:26,228
I hate the way your
jaw pops when you chew.

712
00:38:26,229 --> 00:38:28,398
And I hated every second I spent

713
00:38:28,482 --> 00:38:29,941
holding that clammy hand.

714
00:38:30,025 --> 00:38:31,777
I should've killed you in the womb.

715
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:32,861
Ah, fuck you!

716
00:38:32,944 --> 00:38:34,029
Fuck you!

717
00:38:34,112 --> 00:38:35,614
Fuck you, Tommy!

718
00:38:35,697 --> 00:38:37,824
Sorry.

719
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:40,327
Ah.

720
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:41,870
Hey, I know you like fucking Supes,

721
00:38:41,953 --> 00:38:44,039
but I'm off the table.

722
00:38:44,122 --> 00:38:46,208
That's not why I'm here, okay?

723
00:38:46,291 --> 00:38:47,542
You're here, too, you know.

724
00:38:47,626 --> 00:38:48,835
Whatever, Pornhub.

725
00:38:48,919 --> 00:38:51,546
I don't have time for you right now.

726
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:00,180
Hey.

727
00:39:00,263 --> 00:39:02,099
You never said you were sorry.

728
00:39:02,182 --> 00:39:03,183
What?

729
00:39:03,266 --> 00:39:05,393
For Robin.

730
00:39:05,477 --> 00:39:08,480
You never apologized for Robin.

731
00:39:08,563 --> 00:39:10,190
Jesus, you want to do this right now?

732
00:39:10,273 --> 00:39:11,525
Yeah, I do.

733
00:39:11,608 --> 00:39:13,318
You just get away with
everything, don't you?

734
00:39:13,401 --> 00:39:16,279
Just running past all the
broken people you leave behind.

735
00:39:17,989 --> 00:39:21,201
All right, you know what?

736
00:39:21,284 --> 00:39:22,619
What?

737
00:39:25,914 --> 00:39:27,249
I'm sorry.

738
00:39:29,126 --> 00:39:31,461
Is that what you want to hear?

739
00:39:31,545 --> 00:39:34,965
'Cause I am.

740
00:39:35,048 --> 00:39:37,175
Okay?

741
00:39:37,259 --> 00:39:39,010
It's fucked up,

742
00:39:39,094 --> 00:39:43,473
seeing somebody that you
love get hurt like that.

743
00:39:43,557 --> 00:39:45,600
I'm sorry.

744
00:39:48,728 --> 00:39:51,189
I'm fucking sorry, Hughie.

745
00:39:57,487 --> 00:39:59,239
- Hughie. Hughie.
- How did you do that?

746
00:39:59,322 --> 00:40:01,700
- Stop, stop!
- No. No, no, no. How the fuck did you do that?

747
00:40:01,783 --> 00:40:02,951
- I'll show you again!
- No.

748
00:40:03,034 --> 00:40:04,870
That is not going to happen.

749
00:40:04,953 --> 00:40:06,913
A-Train, get out of here.

750
00:40:06,997 --> 00:40:09,541
Not that you deserve the warning.

751
00:40:09,624 --> 00:40:11,168
Come on. Come on.

752
00:40:11,251 --> 00:40:13,003
Come on, come on.

753
00:40:15,755 --> 00:40:17,966
Is he here?

754
00:40:18,049 --> 00:40:20,594
He's only here for the twins, all right?

755
00:40:20,677 --> 00:40:22,387
Nobody else has to get hurt.

756
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:25,473
You don't get to decide who to
serve up on a platter here, okay?

757
00:40:25,557 --> 00:40:27,893
These are real people. We
need to clear the house now.

758
00:40:27,976 --> 00:40:29,686
This is about to be a fucking bloodbath.

759
00:40:29,769 --> 00:40:32,022
No, it won't. I made Soldier
Boy promise not to do anything...

760
00:40:32,105 --> 00:40:35,233
Hughie, stop it. Listen to me.

761
00:40:35,317 --> 00:40:37,694
Homelander is coming.

762
00:40:38,737 --> 00:40:40,447
The Deep told me.

763
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:42,199
When those two start fighting...

764
00:40:43,283 --> 00:40:46,494
Please. Help me.

765
00:40:55,712 --> 00:40:57,714
- You have to go.
- No. I need to stop him.

766
00:40:57,797 --> 00:40:59,424
Annie. No, Annie.

767
00:40:59,507 --> 00:41:01,134
Annie!

768
00:41:04,262 --> 00:41:06,014
Oh, my God... You teleported me?

769
00:41:06,097 --> 00:41:07,515
What the fuck?

770
00:41:08,934 --> 00:41:10,894
I saved you, Annie.

771
00:41:10,977 --> 00:41:14,564
Jesus Christ. All I want is to save you.

772
00:41:14,648 --> 00:41:17,692
You keep saying that, but
I don't need you to save me.

773
00:41:17,776 --> 00:41:19,236
Right, God forbid I help you,

774
00:41:19,319 --> 00:41:21,029
because I always have
to be the weak one,

775
00:41:21,112 --> 00:41:22,489
- the one you have to rescue.
- No.

776
00:41:22,572 --> 00:41:23,782
You always have to be the strong one.

777
00:41:23,865 --> 00:41:26,451
You always have to be
so much stronger than me.

778
00:41:26,534 --> 00:41:29,579
I thought that you
didn't care about that.

779
00:41:29,663 --> 00:41:32,415
I mean, on our first date,

780
00:41:32,499 --> 00:41:34,209
you said that it didn't bother you.

781
00:41:34,292 --> 00:41:35,710
I know.

782
00:41:39,881 --> 00:41:41,883
But it does.

783
00:41:43,843 --> 00:41:45,470
Sometimes.

784
00:41:47,472 --> 00:41:48,598
A little.

785
00:41:53,186 --> 00:41:56,982
I thought the drugs had
fucked you up, Hughie, but...

786
00:41:58,984 --> 00:42:00,819
... this is you.

787
00:42:03,613 --> 00:42:05,448
This is all you.

788
00:42:39,566 --> 00:42:41,359
Halothane.

789
00:42:45,155 --> 00:42:46,740
What'd you think you
were gonna do with that?

790
00:42:54,331 --> 00:42:56,541
You killed my family.

791
00:42:57,584 --> 00:42:59,002
Which one?

792
00:43:05,592 --> 00:43:06,801
Oi.

793
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:10,388
Not him.

794
00:43:13,725 --> 00:43:15,560
Twins are out there.

795
00:43:26,404 --> 00:43:29,991
So you get Homelander, but
I can't get Soldier Boy?

796
00:43:30,075 --> 00:43:33,328
You're a fucking hypocrite,
Butcher. Now move.

797
00:43:33,411 --> 00:43:34,913
I can't let you do it, M.

798
00:43:34,996 --> 00:43:36,748
It'd be suicide.

799
00:43:50,804 --> 00:43:52,555
Oh, come off it. What
you gonna do with it?

800
00:43:52,639 --> 00:43:53,681
Move!

801
00:43:56,267 --> 00:43:58,228
You're such a fucking idiot.

802
00:43:58,311 --> 00:43:59,729
Can't even work the TiVo without me.

803
00:44:01,981 --> 00:44:04,025
And there it is, sick fuck.

804
00:44:04,109 --> 00:44:06,111
Hiya, kids.

805
00:44:06,194 --> 00:44:08,947
That poop chute's had a workout, huh?

806
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:10,824
Looks like the Lincoln Tunnel.

807
00:44:12,409 --> 00:44:14,077
Ben.

808
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,413
You fucked me, you selfish

809
00:44:16,496 --> 00:44:18,039
piece of shit!

810
00:44:20,208 --> 00:44:21,751
That's enough.

811
00:44:27,173 --> 00:44:30,135
- Nicaragua wasn't our fault.
- Yeah, swear to God.

812
00:44:30,218 --> 00:44:32,137
Then whose fault was it?

813
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:36,516
If you tell me, maybe I'll let you go.

814
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:38,560
I... it was Noir. It was Noir's idea,

815
00:44:38,643 --> 00:44:40,270
top to bottom.

816
00:44:40,353 --> 00:44:42,480
He gave you to the Russians. Please.

817
00:44:42,564 --> 00:44:45,024
- Noir?
- Uh-huh.

818
00:44:45,108 --> 00:44:48,319
- Yeah.
- Noir wouldn't take a shit

819
00:44:48,403 --> 00:44:50,363
without Vought's say-so.

820
00:44:50,447 --> 00:44:53,783
Please? It's the truth.

821
00:45:12,177 --> 00:45:13,970
- Give me your hand.
- It's been years.

822
00:45:14,053 --> 00:45:15,930
Do you want to die?

823
00:45:17,015 --> 00:45:19,767
TNT detonate!

824
00:45:30,445 --> 00:45:32,030
- I got to go.
- Annie, wait.

825
00:45:32,113 --> 00:45:34,282
Annie, Annie, Annie, just...

826
00:45:34,365 --> 00:45:35,658
You can't go.

827
00:45:35,742 --> 00:45:37,118
I can't?

828
00:45:37,202 --> 00:45:39,496
I'm not gonna let you.

829
00:45:56,679 --> 00:45:59,098
Oh, shit.

830
00:45:59,182 --> 00:46:00,767
No. No.

831
00:46:00,850 --> 00:46:02,435
I don't want to hear it right now.

832
00:46:10,652 --> 00:46:11,903
Blue Hawk!

833
00:46:11,986 --> 00:46:13,863
- What?
- We got to talk.

834
00:46:13,947 --> 00:46:16,991
Jesus Christ, not right now.
There's a psycho back there.

835
00:46:20,245 --> 00:46:22,539
The fuck? Get your fucking hands off me.

836
00:46:22,622 --> 00:46:25,542
You hurt a lot of people.
You hurt my brother.

837
00:46:25,625 --> 00:46:27,335
You're not gonna get away with it.

838
00:46:27,418 --> 00:46:28,836
Not this time.

839
00:46:29,796 --> 00:46:31,839
Fuck!

840
00:46:59,409 --> 00:47:01,035
God.

841
00:47:18,761 --> 00:47:21,514
Help me.

842
00:47:21,598 --> 00:47:24,058
S... someone please help...

843
00:47:57,425 --> 00:47:58,801
Huh.

844
00:48:08,645 --> 00:48:10,188
Sorted?

845
00:48:12,231 --> 00:48:14,233
What happened?

846
00:48:23,409 --> 00:48:26,746
William Butcher and Soldier Boy.

847
00:48:26,829 --> 00:48:28,373
Of course.

848
00:48:28,456 --> 00:48:31,209
You are behind this.

849
00:48:31,292 --> 00:48:33,169
This whole thing.

850
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:37,465
It really is all about me.

851
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,718
William, we made a deal

852
00:48:40,802 --> 00:48:45,098
to fight to the death, you and me.

853
00:48:45,181 --> 00:48:47,266
This is cheating.

854
00:48:47,350 --> 00:48:49,394
Deal's off.

855
00:48:57,235 --> 00:48:59,487
You were my hero growing up.

856
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:03,366
I watched all your
movies, hundreds of times.

857
00:49:03,449 --> 00:49:06,953
You were the only one that
was nearly as strong as me.

858
00:49:07,036 --> 00:49:10,832
Buddy, you think you look strong?

859
00:49:10,915 --> 00:49:13,167
You're wearing a cape.

860
00:49:13,251 --> 00:49:16,379
You're just a cheap fucking knockoff.

861
00:49:16,462 --> 00:49:18,589
Oh, no, no, no.

862
00:49:21,175 --> 00:49:23,010
I'm the upgrade.

863
00:49:37,358 --> 00:49:39,235
M.M. M.M.

864
00:49:39,318 --> 00:49:41,904
M.M., M.M., please, I
need you. People are hurt.

865
00:49:41,988 --> 00:49:44,949
M.M.! M.M. Please.

866
00:49:45,032 --> 00:49:47,452
He doesn't control you.

867
00:49:47,535 --> 00:49:49,203
We have to help these people.

868
00:49:50,246 --> 00:49:51,956
It's up to us.

869
00:50:12,101 --> 00:50:14,896
You really had me going
for a minute there.

870
00:50:17,565 --> 00:50:19,567
Oi.

871
00:50:26,657 --> 00:50:28,326
What the fuck?

872
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:37,543
What have you done?

873
00:50:37,627 --> 00:50:40,338
Scorched earth.

874
00:51:38,563 --> 00:51:39,605
Do it!

875
00:51:44,735 --> 00:51:45,945
Hughie!

876
00:51:46,028 --> 00:51:47,154
Get out of here!

877
00:51:47,238 --> 00:51:48,406
No fucking way.

878
00:52:19,228 --> 00:52:20,438
Let's see?

879
00:52:53,763 --> 00:52:55,181
Hey.

880
00:52:57,516 --> 00:52:58,726
I'm sorry.

881
00:53:05,733 --> 00:53:08,402
Hey, please, no. Easy.

882
00:53:08,486 --> 00:53:10,321
We need a doctor to
resew these stitches.

883
00:53:17,328 --> 00:53:19,497
It was always me.

884
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:21,624
What do you mean?

885
00:53:23,918 --> 00:53:27,463
I blamed the V for making me a monster

886
00:53:28,589 --> 00:53:29,589
but...

887
00:53:30,257 --> 00:53:32,718
that's not true.

888
00:53:32,802 --> 00:53:35,721
It is just who I am.

889
00:53:35,805 --> 00:53:37,640
No.

890
00:53:37,723 --> 00:53:39,725
You are not a monster.

891
00:53:44,730 --> 00:53:48,275
It seems no matter
how much we try to run,

892
00:53:48,359 --> 00:53:51,779
we cannot escape our old lives, huh?

893
00:53:53,781 --> 00:53:56,450
I suppose no one can run that fast.

894
00:54:04,291 --> 00:54:08,379
Those things

895
00:54:08,462 --> 00:54:12,091
Little Nina said about you

896
00:54:12,174 --> 00:54:15,428
are NOT true.

897
00:54:17,346 --> 00:54:18,973
Yeah.

898
00:55:08,647 --> 00:55:10,149
This is a bad idea.

899
00:55:12,193 --> 00:55:15,321
Homelander helped make
me America's sweetheart.

900
00:55:17,990 --> 00:55:19,825
He's gonna regret that.

901
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:29,919
- You ready?
- Mm-hmm.

902
00:55:31,962 --> 00:55:34,090
I'm in Montpelier, Vermont.

903
00:55:34,173 --> 00:55:37,093
Twelve heroes and civilians are dead,

904
00:55:37,176 --> 00:55:39,178
a lot more are wounded.

905
00:55:39,261 --> 00:55:41,597
Now, Homelander and Vought
are going to tell you

906
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:45,643
that it was the Supervillain
and that they have it handled.

907
00:55:45,726 --> 00:55:47,269
They don't.

908
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:51,107
It was Soldier Boy.

909
00:55:51,190 --> 00:55:53,442
I know I sound insane, but...

910
00:55:53,526 --> 00:55:59,031
Soldier Boy doesn't care
about protecting Americans,

911
00:55:59,115 --> 00:56:01,367
and he probably never has.

912
00:56:01,450 --> 00:56:05,412
Most heroes don't care about you.

913
00:56:05,496 --> 00:56:10,000
They only care about their image, and...

914
00:56:10,084 --> 00:56:12,753
Homelander is the worst of them.

915
00:56:14,755 --> 00:56:17,174
He's hurt people.

916
00:56:17,258 --> 00:56:19,468
He's done something to Maeve.

917
00:56:23,556 --> 00:56:27,893
I don't know what they're gonna
do to me for telling the truth,

918
00:56:27,977 --> 00:56:32,690
but I'm going to keep doing it,
and I should've done it sooner.

919
00:56:32,773 --> 00:56:34,859
I'm sorry.

920
00:56:34,942 --> 00:56:37,820
And one more thing.

921
00:56:37,903 --> 00:56:41,073
I'm not Starlight anymore.

922
00:56:41,157 --> 00:56:43,159
My name is Annie January...

923
00:56:45,161 --> 00:56:47,580
... and I fucking quit.
