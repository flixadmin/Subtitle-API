1
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,440
Oh, God.

2
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,080
<i>Toner</i>

3
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,720
<i>Gotham City Coroner</i>

4
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,880
Hell of a way to start the day.

5
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,440
I mean, I just cleaned this.

6
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,520
Harvey.

7
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,240
Hey. Uniforms found the body.

8
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:33,160
No wallet, no ID, no watch.
He got beaten up pretty good.

9
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,720
I'm guessing the cause of death
is that gigantic gash

10
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,000
on the side of his neck.

11
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,720
You think?
What's all the black on him?

12
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,160
Ink? Paint?

13
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,560
- Good morning, Ed.
- Detective.

14
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,000
Going by overall coagulation,
I'd say time of death is midnight.

15
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,040
But he's only been here
for a couple hours.

16
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,640
Rats have just started on his ears.

17
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,200
Sneaky little buggers.

18
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,800
So not a mugging.
Muggers don't move the body.

19
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,960
Abrasions on his knuckles?

20
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,040
Put up a fight.

21
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,080
Yeah. Look at his suspenders.

22
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,760
I'm guessing
he's some kind of finance guy.

23
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,400
Maybe it was an abduction-ransom
thing gone wrong.

24
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,400
He resists, ka-chunk...

25
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,400
You wanna talk to the uniforms
who found the body?

26
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,800
You do it.

27
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,440
We should canvass the area, though.
A lot of homeless around here.

28
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,960
- I'll get some units on it.
- I'll handle it myself.

29
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,880
Hey, Joe. Go smoke somewhere else.

30
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,960
Come on, Jim, that's what we got
uniforms for. Let them do it.

31
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,520
And I'd rather handle it myself.

32
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,520
Detectives. I'm guessing I should run
all the prints.

33
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,880
- Yeah, Ed, run the prints.
- This one too?

34
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,800
Yeah, Ed. That one too.

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,200
It wasn't even a proper yacht.

36
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,680
It was more like a dinghy.

37
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,640
Can I help you?

38
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,120
- What a lovely brooch.
- Thank you.

39
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,720
May I have it?

40
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,960
I have a friend who would love that.

41
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,240
Excuse me?

42
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,560
I'm sorry.

43
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,720
May I please have it?

44
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,880
- You shouldn't have.
- I wanted to make a gesture.

45
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,400
I hope in time, we can be friends.

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,080
Friends?

47
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,560
Sure.

48
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,240
Why not? What's done is done.

49
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,520
I'm so glad you feel that way.

50
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,160
Don Maroni wants us
to clarify terms.

51
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,840
Well, it's business as usual.

52
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,520
Maroni still has his drugs,
his unions.

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,640
He pays tariff for the ports.

54
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,120
If he needs favors from the cops
or the mayor

55
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,240
Don Falcone will consider it.

56
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,840
And of course the families
still share Arkham.

57
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,320
And there's to be no blood spilled
on either side.

58
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,880
Not a drop.

59
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,760
Maybe just a drop.

60
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,120
Look at you.

61
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:08,760
Timothy, do you know this fellow
used to have your job?

62
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,760
Carried my umbrella
and thought it an honor.

63
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,280
Now look at him.

64
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,520
Has a seat at the table.

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,120
Things change, eh?

66
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,440
I've been blessed.

67
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,000
Perhaps I should open your gift.

68
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,560
My goodness.

69
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,800
That is beautiful.

70
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,920
Now I feel awful.

71
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,960
- I didn't get you anything.
- No.

72
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,880
Thank you.

73
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,560
- Sweet.
- That was uncalled for.

74
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,080
I brought you into my family
and I treated you like a son.

75
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,440
- And you betrayed me.
- For which I suffered.

76
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,600
Not enough.

77
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,360
When I order some fool killed,
I expect him to stay that way.

78
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,000
Your boss, Don Falcone

79
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,440
- expressly said...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. He wants peace.

80
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,080
He's the only reason
why your ass is still alive.

81
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:17,040
And if I were you, I would pray
for his good health.

82
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,560
Oh, I do.

83
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,800
- I do.
- Good.

84
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,200
Because remember...

85
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,280
things change.

86
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,800
Convey my respects to your don.

87
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,000
Likewise.

88
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,280
Peace...

89
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,680
friend.

90
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,320
{\an5}Come now, Master Bruce.
Had to happen sooner or later.

91
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,240
{\an5}Is this really necessary?

92
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,800
{\an5}Homeschooling is just as effective.
I can show you the data.

93
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,800
{\an5}You need to be around children
your own age.

94
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,400
- Why?
- Because you do.

95
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,240
You know I despise
that sort of answer.

96
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,400
Don't you miss your mates?

97
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,800
{\an5}Not really.

98
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,160
{\an5}I've always found them
kind of childish.

99
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,040
{\an5}That's what they're meant to be,
aren't they? It's what they do.

100
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,640
{\an5}Don't you wanna be like a normal kid?

101
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,320
{\an5}I'm not sure.

102
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,240
{\an5}Define normal
and make a good case for it.

103
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,360
{\an5}You're going to bloody school.
Now, start walking.

104
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,120
{\an5}Good luck, lad.

105
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,560
Very sorry for your loss, ma'am.

106
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,160
{\an5}Can you think of anyone
who'd wanna hurt your son, Coleman?

107
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,560
{\an5}No, sir. Nobody.

108
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,160
{\an5}He was a good boy.

109
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,600
{\an5}Yes, ma'am. I can see that.

110
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,880
No arrests, an honest young man.

111
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,400
{\an5}- What did he do for a living?
- He worked in a coffee shop.

112
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,760
{\an5}When we found him, he was in a suit.
Suspenders.

113
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,880
{\an5}He was looking for a job in finance.

114
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,840
He was very ambitious.

115
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,200
{\an5}First in our family to go to college.

116
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,520
{\an5}Who would do this, sir? Why?

117
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,960
We'll do our best to find out, ma'am.

118
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,080
Gordon's finishing up
with the mother.

119
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,720
{\an5}So far,
nothing off the severed thumb.

120
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,360
{\an5}And none of the city's ERs have
seen any thumb-less guys.

121
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,120
{\an5}- You think he went black market?
- That's next on my list.

122
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,440
{\an5}- How's Gordon?
- Angry.

123
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,280
{\an5}How would you feel if every cop
in the building ran out on you?

124
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,040
Now they treat him
like he's got the plague.

125
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,680
Seeing him reminds them
of what cowards they all are.

126
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,680
I'm sorry, Cap. I...
I didn't mean you.

127
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,560
{\an5}Nope. You're right.

128
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,160
{\an5}But he's gotta get over that.

129
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,200
{\an5}Can't do this job alone.

130
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,920
{\an5}Lucky he's got you.

131
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,840
Yeah.

132
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,840
So beautiful.

133
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,640
As soon as I saw it,
I thought of you.

134
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,160
Such a good son.

135
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,640
Put it on, put it on.

136
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,720
Wha... What happened? Who did this?

137
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,160
Nobody. It's just a scratch.

138
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,400
Is your mother a fool? No.

139
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,840
Someone is being mean to my boy.

140
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,080
It's a tough business.

141
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,680
The restaurant business
is so tough these days.

142
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,760
Why is that?

143
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,960
My success makes other
people envious.

144
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,840
So tell the boss on these people.

145
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,400
This person isn't scared of the boss.

146
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,400
Not like they should be.

147
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,640
- I don't know why.
- I know.

148
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:53,840
When I was in school,
Magda Himmelfarb was so mean to me

149
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,560
and teacher did nothing.

150
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,960
Why?

151
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:02,200
Because such a good dancer, I was.

152
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:08,280
And Magda, with her nice hair
and her big bosoms, a cart-horse.

153
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,680
I meant,
why did the teacher do nothing?

154
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,320
Why you think?

155
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,080
Private lessons, they said.

156
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,160
I put stop to that.

157
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,800
You told on them.

158
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,160
Oh, no.

159
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,800
I denounced Magda's father
to secret police.

160
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,360
Three weeks he's been turning
up his nose at my traps.

161
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:40,800
And now, now today,
a smidge of camembert

162
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,280
and Mr. Rat, he cannot resist.

163
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:49,640
No. Oh, can you?
Can you, my little greedy baby?

164
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,280
I found out your secret.

165
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,080
Yes.

166
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,640
Everybody has a secret.

167
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,960
Rat

168
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,280
Morphine! Morphine!

169
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,960
They teach you that in med school?

170
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,080
Bullock.

171
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,480
Is that Kenny Suffield?

172
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,120
Smash-and-grab guy.
Also a real hound with the ladies.

173
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,200
- Who shot him?
- I don't ask.

174
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,960
Well, me and my partner
are doing all the rounds

175
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,000
of you black-market sawbones.

176
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,320
Guy we're looking for would've
come in early this morning,

177
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,520
- missing a thumb.
- Sorry.

178
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,720
You'd tell us if you knew,
wouldn't you, Doc?

179
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,840
I mean, that's the deal, right?

180
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,480
You give us info
and we let you keep operating.

181
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,520
That's a pun. Operating.

182
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,360
Bullock, black ink?

183
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,720
Just like on the victim?

184
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,520
Oh, Doc...

185
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,200
Fine.
He came in about 3.00 this morning.

186
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,440
Didn't give a name
but this dropped out of his pocket.

187
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,920
- Sionis Investments.
- What did he look like?

188
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,640
Mid-20s, suit, suspenders.

189
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,160
Just like our dead guy.

190
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,120
Sorry, Doc.

191
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,600
This is Gordon.

192
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,680
I need an ambulance and
a black-and-white at 1856 Wilton...

193
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,360
Wait. Just a second.

194
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,440
Just get me Alvarez, will you?

195
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,800
Bullock. Bullock, what the hell, man?
I got a deal with that guy.

196
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,880
- Deal's off.
- But I told you everything.

197
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,440
Yeah, after we caught you in a lie.

198
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,920
He always lies. You just squeeze him.

199
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,960
- You're screwing the rest of us.
- Oh, yeah?

200
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,560
- How's that feel? You like it?
- Hey, enough! Enough!

201
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,120
I get it, I get it, huh?

202
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,440
None of these sons of bitches
had your back when it mattered.

203
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,640
But where was I?
I was there, remember?

204
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,760
With Falcone, the Mayor,
blaze of glory?

205
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,480
- Be nice for my sake.
- I am being nice.

206
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,560
Haven't you learned your lesson?

207
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,040
We're only alive
because Falcone let us live.

208
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,080
You gotta go along to get along, Jim.

209
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,160
No, I don't.

210
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,440
You think locking up Doc Scumbag
there is gonna make a difference?

211
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,600
I'm on your side, I proved that.

212
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,200
Yeah, you did.

213
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:53,560
So I'm asking you, please,
let the Doc out, and tomorrow

214
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,200
you and I will go check out
this Sionis Investments together.

215
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,080
All right, partner?

216
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,880
Sorry, Harv.

217
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,440
- This ain't right, Harvey.
- Alvarez, put a zipper on it!

218
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,080
- Jim.
- Barbara, what are you...

219
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,560
I heard someone come in.
You didn't turn on the lights.

220
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,880
- So you got out my spare?
- You were late. I got nervous.

221
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,120
I... God.

222
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,400
Not the best idea to be handling
a firearm when you've been drinking.

223
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,640
I'm sorry.

224
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:52,920
Look, you've been through a lot.
It's over now.

225
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,960
I am scared, Jim.

226
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,680
Everywhere I go, I can...

227
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,480
I can feel that monster Zsasz
stalking me, and I...

228
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,880
He's not a monster.

229
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,440
He's just a man.

230
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,560
I won't let anyone hurt you.

231
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,520
How can you promise me that?

232
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,640
Tell me it'll be okay.

233
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,560
Please tell me
there really aren't any monsters.

234
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,880
Just...

235
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,240
lie if you have to.

236
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,800
There aren't any monsters.

237
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,640
When are we gonna get out of here?

238
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,680
That's up to you.

239
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,080
Morning.

240
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,920
Hey...

241
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,440
I didn't think you were up.

242
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,320
That last night was just nerves

243
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,720
and way too much to drink.

244
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,600
I said I wanted half your life,
and I've got it.

245
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,960
Leave the gun.

246
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,520
- I wish it wasn't like this.
- Do you really?

247
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,120
Ignore me. I'm just tired.

248
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,280
Go. Catch some bad guys.

249
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,560
Go get them.

250
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,520
Forensic examination by Edward Nygma.

251
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,440
8.42am. GCPD morgue.

252
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,760
The room is approximately 19°C.

253
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,040
I ate half a cranberry muffin
earlier, saving the rest.

254
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,800
What do a dead man, a cruise ship,
and an emu have in common?

255
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,080
Correct. Nothing.

256
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,760
Ever more curious.

257
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,720
He what?

258
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,520
Nygma, how many times have I told you
to stay the hell out of here?

259
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,640
But I discovered something...

260
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,320
You'll discover your butt on
the street if you keep doing this.

261
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,400
Out.

262
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,920
Your loss.

263
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,040
You sloppy ignoramus.

264
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,280
- Hi, Bruce.
- Hi.

265
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,600
Brucey, how you doing?

266
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,600
Tommy, hey.

267
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,000
- I'm well. How are you?
- You know, chilling.

268
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,440
So your mom and dad got killed, huh?

269
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,120
Yes.

270
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,240
Did you see the whole thing?
The blood and everything?

271
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,200
- I'd rather not talk about that.
- I was just interested.

272
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,720
Never seen a real dead body.

273
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,720
Was there guts?

274
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,840
I'll be going to class now.

275
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,920
Forgive me, Mother,
for I have sinned.

276
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Funny.

277
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,480
Feels weird meeting here.

278
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,880
You don't want anyone
to see us together.

279
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,480
Falcone has his eyes everywhere.

280
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,440
So where are we?

281
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,120
I cook for him. I sing to him.
We go on walks.

282
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,680
I don't know whether I'm his maid,
his lover, or his mother.

283
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,720
Or all three. He cares about you.

284
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,480
Yeah.

285
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,920
Have you been inside
his private office?

286
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,760
Yeah, a few times.

287
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,720
Inside the right bottom desk drawer
is a ledger.

288
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,240
Copy the last two pages.

289
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,000
It'll be locked. You'll need a key
off of his key ring.

290
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,160
How do I get that?

291
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,080
Behind you is a vial.

292
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,400
Give it to him. He'll sleep like
the dead for two hours.

293
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,000
It won't kill him, will it?

294
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:01,120
Liza... you haven't got feelings
for the old man, have you?

295
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,760
Not at all.

296
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,200
No, it won't kill him.

297
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,960
Killing him now
would only create chaos.

298
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,480
I need to siphon his strength.

299
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,560
So when the time is right

300
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,640
taking over his organization
will be like slipping on a glove.

301
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,480
What if one of his men
catches me snooping?

302
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,560
Then you're probably dead.

303
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,240
You leave first.

304
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,040
Right, right, right.

305
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,520
I'm under a lot of pressure.

306
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,560
<i>Success Today Ready For War</i>

307
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,120
Something tells me
we came to the right place.

308
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,400
- You think?
- Mr. Sionis will see you now.

309
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,160
Richard Sionis.

310
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,480
James Gordon.
This is my partner, Harvey Bullock.

311
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:19,160
How can I help you, detectives?
I don't have much time.

312
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,320
You know this man? Coleman Lawson?

313
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,920
He might have interviewed for a job.

314
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,840
Sorry.

315
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,080
Any of your employees
miss work yesterday?

316
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,760
Any of them show up
today with an injured right hand?

317
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,680
I don't take roll call, Detective.

318
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,880
You mind if we check?

319
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,400
Perhaps you can tell me
what this is about.

320
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,960
Coleman Lawson was killed
two nights ago.

321
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,440
The man who did it
had your firm's card in his pocket.

322
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,400
There's a thousand ways
he could have gotten that.

323
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,760
What's with all the warrior baloney?

324
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,840
It inspires me.

325
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,080
High finance is a tough business.

326
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,000
In order to succeed,
you have to be a warrior.

327
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,080
No, you don't.

328
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,520
You have to be a good businessman.

329
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,760
Warriors fight wars. It's different.

330
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,000
So you fancy yourself a killer.

331
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,880
Have you killed people, Mr. Sionis?

332
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,960
Only metaphorically.

333
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,840
So all this is just juvenile
play-acting.

334
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:17,360
Exactly. Thus speaks a man
who's seen actual combat.

335
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,880
You've killed people for real,
haven't you?

336
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,960
True killers are easy to spot.

337
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,000
Yes, they are.

338
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,160
Why all the masks?

339
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,560
A shrink would say
you're hiding something.

340
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,840
To the contrary.

341
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:35,840
A mask hides the face,
but frees the soul.

342
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,360
A mask speaks the truth.

343
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,640
Deep.

344
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,240
How come so many of your employees
have scars and injuries?

345
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,640
Our touch football games
get very rough.

346
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,280
You're a liar, Mr. Sionis.

347
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,120
Such fire.

348
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:55,080
You must miss the battlefield
desperately.

349
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,320
I imagine killing gets
quite addictive.

350
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,840
You murdered Coleman Lawson,
didn't you?

351
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,400
Prove it.

352
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,120
We will.

353
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,520
I'd give you a "good cop" routine,
but it's not in my tool kit.

354
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,840
GCPD. Turn around slowly.

355
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,360
Let me see those hands.

356
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,080
Don't move.

357
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,760
Should have waited for me.

358
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,120
Hey, Brucey.

359
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,280
It's Bruce.

360
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,160
No Y.

361
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,640
No parents either,
so I can call you what I like.

362
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,960
Please get out of my way.

363
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,720
Snobby little jerk, isn't he?

364
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,280
For an orphan.

365
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,120
You're being very unkind.

366
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,560
I don't understand why.

367
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,760
Boy, you're a weirdo.

368
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,080
Your mother must have...

369
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,920
Don't talk about my mother.

370
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,760
Oh, really?

371
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,800
Oh, is that Timothy?

372
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,120
We met at Fish Mooney's.

373
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,040
I'm the fellow
who used to have your job.

374
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,120
I was hoping to ask you
a few questions.

375
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,520
I don't know anything...

376
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,800
There'll be time for that.

377
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,560
First things first.

378
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,120
Most killers leave their prints
at the crime scene. But not you, no.

379
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,720
You left your whole thumb
in the dead guy's mouth.

380
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,920
You got style. I like you, kid.

381
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,400
This is your last chance.

382
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:50,200
Once we walk out that door,
it's over.

383
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,800
- It was self-defense.
- Of course, it was.

384
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,280
Wasn't that what I said, Jim?

385
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,400
Didn't I say
it was probably self-defense?

386
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,280
Talk.

387
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,840
Gordon's getting the rest
of his statement.

388
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,640
Apparently, it was part of
the hiring process.

389
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,440
Sionis told the top
three candidates to fight it out.

390
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,160
They weren't supposed to fight
to the death but...

391
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,760
This is unbelievable.

392
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,560
They all signed confidentiality
agreements.

393
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,240
So they're accomplices
to whatever happens.

394
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,560
Do we know where the fight was held?

395
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,680
Some old office building.
The windows were boarded up.

396
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,840
And he was taken there blindfolded.

397
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,920
Yes, Ed.

398
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,760
Printer toner.

399
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,320
Do you know what he's talking about?

400
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,440
The medical examiner's report said
it was black ink...

401
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,400
but I did my own examination
and it was printer toner.

402
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,320
Also, I pulled staples
from his shoulders

403
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,520
and found graphite chips
between his ribs.

404
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,960
Your man was killed in an office.

405
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,000
Yeah, we're kind of past that, Ed.
But thanks.

406
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,640
Is there something else?

407
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,000
Yes, it made me think of a case
from a year ago.

408
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,920
Young man, business suit.

409
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,640
Esophagus lacerated from index cards
shoved down his throat.

410
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,720
So I did some digging.

411
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,680
How many other bodies were killed
with office supplies?

412
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,000
Four. In the last three years.

413
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,880
Get that man to sign a confession.
Now.

414
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,800
I think we have a problem.

415
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,200
I explained to Detective Gordon,
as counsel to Mr. Adams

416
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,960
I advised him against
speaking further.

417
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,560
Also, any statements he has made

418
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,920
will be considered having
been made under duress.

419
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,320
And how much is Sionis
paying him to take the fall?

420
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,400
Good day.

421
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,880
He showed up before
Adams could sign his statement.

422
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,280
Gotta figure out
where Sionis is staging his fights.

423
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,920
I'll run all the buildings he
or his company owns in Gotham.

424
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,840
- This make any sense to you?
- No.

425
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,480
But how is it any worse
than the Goat or Balloon Man?

426
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,480
When did this become normal
for this city? What changed?

427
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,640
Maybe nothing. It was always
just below the surface

428
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,120
only needed a spark.

429
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,040
What? Thomas and Martha Wayne
being killed?

430
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,400
I'm not blind, Gordon.
I know you're still looking into it.

431
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,040
But how could their deaths
have caused all this?

432
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,600
Why were they so important?

433
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,400
I think it's what they represented.

434
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,560
A different Gotham.

435
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,000
Decent. Hopeful.

436
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,080
Whatever it was, it's gone now.

437
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,080
When Zsasz came for you,
I should have stayed.

438
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,160
I told you to go.

439
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,760
That doesn't matter.
I should have stayed.

440
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,440
- Let's get this guy.
- Yeah.

441
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,600
Tad late, Master Bruce. Oi.

442
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,200
- Oi, what happened to you?
- I'm perfectly fine.

443
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,400
What happened?

444
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,360
Someone spoke disrespectfully
about my mother.

445
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,000
Oh, did they, now?

446
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,800
Well, I hope you broke their bastard
teeth for them.

447
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,720
No.

448
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,160
He's much bigger than me, and I...

449
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,960
I'm not good at fighting.
Didn't hurt him at all.

450
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,480
Not at all.

451
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,000
Don't tell the school.

452
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,000
Not bloody likely.

453
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,200
Take a look at this.
Sionis owns half of Gotham.

454
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,800
All right. We'll split up.

455
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,280
Focus on the buildings
that are abandoned

456
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,360
or under construction first.

457
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,600
This son of a bitch
is not getting away.

458
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,800
I'll say one thing.
He has your number.

459
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,640
- What are you talking about?
- Sionis.

460
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,640
You may not have put down
Cobblepot, Jimmy boy

461
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,000
but you've got a demon in you.

462
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,480
You can call yourself a soldier
but all this fighting Falcone,

463
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,920
fighting other cops, you love it.

464
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,440
So when you find something
that seems remotely possible,

465
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,520
call me.

466
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,240
Barbara. Everything all right?

467
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:24,800
Fine. I just... I wanted to check in.

468
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,320
Look, can we talk later? I'm kind
of in the middle of something.

469
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,360
Of course. I love...

470
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,200
Hey.

471
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,240
Boss wants his tea.

472
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,640
It's almost ready.

473
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,720
GCPD.

474
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,960
Anybody else here?

475
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,360
That... would be a yes.

476
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,240
<i>Collette</i>

477
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,880
Hey.

478
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,320
Hi.

479
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,440
Girl's gotta shop.

480
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,080
This is your father's watch.

481
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,360
Don't you lose it, now.

482
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,920
Tommy Elliot's house.

483
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,400
- Don't you be scared.
- I'm not.

484
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,160
I'm visualizing what I'm going to do.

485
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,960
Because if you don't want to do this,
there's no shame in it.

486
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,880
There would be immense shame in it.

487
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,880
What the hell are you doing here?

488
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,280
We have unfinished business.

489
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,440
Listen, if you think
you're gonna tell my parents...

490
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:07,400
- Are you crazy?
- Don't talk about my mother.

491
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,920
Master Bruce!

492
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,600
Point well made, I think.

493
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,400
You all right, mate?
Any broken bones?

494
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,280
He... he tried to kill me.

495
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,400
That's right.

496
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,040
He did. He tried to kill you.

497
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,400
Just you remember that
next time you see him.

498
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:33,160
And you remember that I let him try.

499
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,720
Now, let's get some ice
on those knuckles.

500
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,800
What do you fancy for your dinner?

501
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,920
- Pizza.
- Pizza?

502
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,080
Superb choice, Master Bruce.

503
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,360
Jim, where the hell are you?
My list crapped out. Call me.

504
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,960
Nygma, Gordon hasn't called in,
has he?

505
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,040
No.

506
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,920
But if the detective becomes
the mystery, then...

507
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,760
<i>Wake up.</i>

508
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:07,040
<i>Detective Gordon. Wake up!</i>

509
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:14,160
<i>So, three of you
applied for a position at my firm.</i>

510
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:18,640
<i>I explained then, you can use
anything here as a weapon.</i>

511
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,840
<i>The last man standing gets the job.</i>

512
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:25,280
<i>However, tonight is special.</i>

513
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,760
<i>You see the man without the mask?</i>

514
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,080
<i>Whoever kills him is the victor.</i>

515
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,240
Listen to me. I'm a cop.

516
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,720
So far none of you
have broken any laws.

517
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,680
<i>Let the games begin.</i>

518
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,160
One last chance. Nobody move.

519
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:49,240
<i>Oh, and I'll throw in
a million-dollar signing bonus.</i>

520
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,200
Oh, crap.

521
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:01,040
Alvarez, I need help checking
these addresses.

522
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,040
- Gordon might be in trouble.
- Busy.

523
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,240
I'm gonna remember
that next time your wife calls

524
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,000
asking where you are, you putz.

525
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:14,160
Collins, listen up, man.
Can I have some help?

526
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,880
Now listen up, you sons of bitches!

527
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,720
So you don't like Gordon.

528
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:29,800
Fine. He can be a total ass hat,
but he is still a cop!

529
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,480
And not one of you, not one,
stood up when he needed it.

530
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,320
That ain't happening twice.

531
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:39,640
I need help
checking these addresses. Now.

532
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,520
Give me a couple.

533
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,560
Okay.

534
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:56,000
- But you cover with my wife, right?
- Yeah.

535
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,120
It's over.

536
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,720
I knew you had a killer in you.

537
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,880
So, where are your brother police?

538
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,400
Did they abandon you?

539
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,800
I don't need them.

540
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,240
Seems like I'll have to
give myself the million dollars.

541
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,280
Jim?

542
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,520
Jim?

543
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,400
Jim!

544
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,600
Thanks.

545
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,400
You're welcome.

546
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,640
<i>If I die</i>

547
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,520
<i>And my soul be lost</i>

548
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:29,600
<i>Ain't nobody's fault but mine</i>

549
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:33,680
<i>Ain't nobody's fault but mine</i>

550
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:41,880
<i>If I die and my soul be lost</i>

551
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:47,520
<i>Ain't nobody's fault but mine</i>

552
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,120
You better have a good reason
for being here.

553
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,320
Did you get what I asked for?

554
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,640
I want out.

555
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,720
No.

556
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,920
He's gonna find out.

557
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,560
Maybe not today, but soon.

558
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,400
Is it worth it?

559
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,680
You are rich.

560
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,840
People are afraid of you.

561
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,240
- Is that not enough?
- No.

562
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,920
It's not.

563
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,120
I grew up not too far from here.

564
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:38,200
One bedroom, cold water,
just me and my mama.

565
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,560
I used to sleep in a bed
behind a curtain.

566
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:44,040
It's where I would hide
when she entertained men.

567
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,360
And that's where I was
when he killed her.

568
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,880
One of Falcone's men.

569
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,400
They didn't like the service.

570
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:58,080
I hid there, silent, until morning.

571
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,400
With my mama two feet away from me.

572
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,480
That night I made a promise.

573
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,720
To get revenge.

574
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,200
To never again be powerless.

575
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,120
To never let any man,

576
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:15,600
any man be over me.

577
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:19,160
This is about keeping
that promise to that little girl.

578
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,840
So what's this about?

579
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:29,920
This is a thread.

580
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,040
I pull this and Falcone comes undone.

581
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,160
You're scared.

582
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:51,760
But I won't let anything happen
to you, and that's a promise.

583
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:56,240
I want you to say,
"I believe you, Mama."

584
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,720
I believe you, Mama.

585
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,160
That's my girl.

586
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,080
The thing is, when I had your job

587
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,920
I had someone asked me
what is Ms. Mooney's secret

588
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,000
I could have answered.

589
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,800
Timothy.

590
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,640
I think you're holding back on me.

591
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,000
Okay. I...

592
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,640
- I might have heard her with Butch.
- Talking about what? Whom?

593
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,120
Fal...

594
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,400
Falcone.

595
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,040
She said our...

596
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,600
"Our friend with Falcone." That's it.

597
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,760
She was whispering. Please...

598
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,400
She has someone close to Falcone.

599
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,600
Of course.

600
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,360
Thank you.

601
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,360
- No one can find the body.
- No.

602
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,480
We are at peace after all.

603
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:04,240
No. No, please. No, no!

604
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,360
Alvarez and Collins
are bringing in Sionis' minions.

605
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,960
Pansies tried to rabbit when
they saw you cuffing their boss.

606
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,040
You okay?

607
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,760
- Essen told me you made a speech.
- I wouldn't call it a speech.

608
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:26,320
- She said you called me an ass hat.
- I did call you that.

609
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,560
Thank you.

610
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,920
For having my back.

611
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,800
Now and before.

612
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,960
Just try not to be such a pain
in the neck.

613
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,560
Makes my day harder.

614
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,480
You know, you were wrong.
What you said earlier.

615
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,680
It's not that I love fighting,
but I'm not afraid to either.

616
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,520
And if we don't fight for this city,
who will?

617
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,320
I'm not gonna stop, Harvey.

618
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:02,280
Falcone, the Mayor, every cop I know
that's dirty, I'm gonna get them.

619
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,680
You should know that.

620
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,000
Go home, Jim.

621
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,920
You were listening tonight,
weren't you?

622
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,880
You gonna get in trouble, old woman.

623
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,640
Heard you telling that girl stories.

624
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,920
A lie with a heart of truth
is a powerful thing.

625
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,040
Go on. It's late.

626
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,560
<i>Incoming: Jim</i>

627
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,480
<i>Jim</i>

628
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,640
Hey, it's me. I'm coming home soon.

629
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,920
Everything's gonna be better.
I promise.

630
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,680
I love you.

631
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,800
Hey, Gordon. You got a minute?

632
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,280
Can it wait?
Kind of on my way out of here.

633
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,520
Some uni's brought in a perp.
Claims to know you.

634
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:23,320
- Oh, yeah? What's the charge?
- B & E. Some fancy store uptown.

635
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,960
Pretty professional job.
Kid didn't even trip the alarm.

636
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,760
Kid?

637
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,480
- A boy or a girl?
- Girl.

638
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,760
Said to ask if you'd been down
any sewers lately.

639
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,760
Hey, Detective.

640
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,200
Miss me?

641
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,760
I enjoyed it.

642
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,840
I enjoyed hurting him.

643
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,040
Of course, you did.

644
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,680
He deserved it.

645
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,200
I'm so angry all the time.

646
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,000
Will it ever go away?

647
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,760
That I don't know.

648
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,640
Alfred...

649
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,760
can you teach me how to fight?

650
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,960
Yes...

651
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,080
Master Bruce.

652
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,040
Yes, I can.
