1
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:03,050
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:03,052 --> 00:00:05,519
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:09,887
To the outside world, I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist,

4
00:00:09,889 --> 00:00:12,924
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

5
00:00:12,926 --> 00:00:16,461
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

6
00:00:16,463 --> 00:00:18,563
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

7
00:00:18,565 --> 00:00:21,799
but in doing so, I opened
up our world to new threats,

8
00:00:21,801 --> 00:00:25,203
and I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

9
00:00:25,205 --> 00:00:28,306
I am The Flash.

10
00:00:28,308 --> 00:00:30,108
Previously on “The Flash”...

11
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:32,844
How many more terrible things
are you gonna do to protect me?

12
00:00:32,846 --> 00:00:34,579
That's my job. That's all that matters.

13
00:00:34,581 --> 00:00:36,414
It's my turn to go out on my own.

14
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:37,682
Don't come looking for me.

15
00:00:37,684 --> 00:00:39,183
Everything seems to be telling me

16
00:00:39,185 --> 00:00:41,052
that Barry and I are
meant to be together.

17
00:00:41,054 --> 00:00:42,620
Somebody please help!

18
00:00:42,622 --> 00:00:45,623
There's only one person
who can help you now.

19
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:47,458
The Flash.

20
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,495
Barry, I know you can't give
up your speed to that monster.

21
00:00:50,497 --> 00:00:51,662
That's not your decision.

22
00:00:51,664 --> 00:00:53,564
Hand him over and it's yours.

23
00:00:53,566 --> 00:00:56,567
- He's slowing down.
- He's becoming human again.

24
00:00:58,338 --> 00:01:01,472
I know some piece of
you did care for me.

25
00:01:01,474 --> 00:01:03,307
Please let him go.

26
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:07,512
Caitlin!

27
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:12,450
It's a regular day in Central City.

28
00:01:12,452 --> 00:01:14,018
Nothing out of the ordinary.

29
00:01:15,822 --> 00:01:18,156
People wake up.

30
00:01:18,158 --> 00:01:20,792
Roll out of bed.

31
00:01:20,794 --> 00:01:22,727
Suit up for the day.

32
00:01:22,729 --> 00:01:25,730
Get to work as fast as they can.

33
00:01:25,732 --> 00:01:28,599
Make sure they get a
caffeine fix along the way

34
00:01:28,601 --> 00:01:30,535
so they can make it
through the mountain of work

35
00:01:30,537 --> 00:01:31,736
that awaits them.

36
00:02:07,974 --> 00:02:10,475
Yup, it's just a regular day.

37
00:02:13,179 --> 00:02:14,712
And I'm just a regular guy.

39
00:02:23,156 --> 00:02:25,590
I really wish we didn't have
to keep Jay's helmet around.

40
00:02:25,592 --> 00:02:27,758
- I hate this thing.
- Well...

41
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,228
Just want to put a dent in it.

42
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:33,664
Cisco, did you see Caitlin in your vibe?

43
00:02:35,068 --> 00:02:36,767
Zoom's got her in his lair.

44
00:02:36,769 --> 00:02:38,669
She's scared, but she's okay.

45
00:02:38,671 --> 00:02:40,071
Oh, thank God.

46
00:02:40,073 --> 00:02:41,439
All right, we need to get her back.

47
00:02:41,441 --> 00:02:42,907
I know.

48
00:02:42,909 --> 00:02:44,742
But without your speed,
there's no way any of us

49
00:02:44,744 --> 00:02:47,145
can get through that breach
that Cisco found at the hospital.

50
00:02:47,147 --> 00:02:49,313
I just don't think there's
anything we can do right now.

51
00:02:49,315 --> 00:02:50,681
He's right.

52
00:02:50,683 --> 00:02:52,049
And it's thanks to you, Al.

53
00:02:52,051 --> 00:02:53,584
Enough. We're all suffering here.

54
00:02:53,586 --> 00:02:55,253
That's right. That's right, Detective.

55
00:02:55,255 --> 00:02:56,821
We're all suffering. We've lost Snow,

56
00:02:56,823 --> 00:02:58,589
you've lost your speed, and now...

57
00:02:58,591 --> 00:03:03,094
now Zoom can come through
that breach anytime he wants.

58
00:03:03,096 --> 00:03:05,296
And that, Allen...

59
00:03:05,298 --> 00:03:06,831
that's on you.

60
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:08,232
Hey, that's on all of us, okay?

61
00:03:08,234 --> 00:03:11,502
We made these decisions as a team.

62
00:03:13,173 --> 00:03:15,973
No we didn't.

63
00:03:15,975 --> 00:03:18,176
Where are you going?

64
00:03:18,178 --> 00:03:19,844
I'm gonna go find Jesse

65
00:03:19,846 --> 00:03:22,113
before Zoom does... again.

66
00:03:22,115 --> 00:03:23,781
Wait, you found her? How?

67
00:03:23,783 --> 00:03:26,417
Cellular dead zones, remote...

68
00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:28,553
People from my Earth vibrate
at a different frequency

69
00:03:28,555 --> 00:03:30,087
than people from your Earth.

70
00:03:30,089 --> 00:03:32,590
They leave cellular dead
zones wherever they go.

71
00:03:32,592 --> 00:03:34,659
That's why I'm always
dropping calls around you?

72
00:03:34,661 --> 00:03:36,460
Okay, so... so wait, how did that help?

73
00:03:36,462 --> 00:03:40,698
I track the dead zones created
by Jesse since she got here

74
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,732
and I follow the trail.

75
00:03:41,734 --> 00:03:44,335
It's easy.

76
00:03:44,337 --> 00:03:46,170
What, so you think
you're gonna need that gun

77
00:03:46,172 --> 00:03:48,539
to convince her to leave with you?

78
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:51,008
You're full of questions
today, aren't you, West?

79
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:52,543
The gun is not for my daughter.

80
00:03:52,545 --> 00:03:54,545
She's not the only person
from a different Earth,

81
00:03:54,547 --> 00:03:55,846
hiding out on this one

82
00:03:55,848 --> 00:03:58,649
If I run into them, I'm gonna need this.

83
00:03:58,651 --> 00:04:01,686
Okay, but you're also
gonna need some help.

84
00:04:01,688 --> 00:04:03,654
Really?

85
00:04:03,656 --> 00:04:06,457
You know anyone with the
speed to help me, Ramon?

86
00:04:07,727 --> 00:04:10,261
Wow.

87
00:04:10,263 --> 00:04:12,396
Great. I'll be in my workshop.

88
00:04:14,867 --> 00:04:16,367
Don't listen to Wells, Barry.

89
00:04:16,369 --> 00:04:19,270
This ain't all on you.

90
00:04:19,272 --> 00:04:22,173
Yeah, I know.

91
00:04:22,175 --> 00:04:23,641
You need a ride back to the station?

92
00:04:23,643 --> 00:04:24,875
No, I'm good.

93
00:04:24,877 --> 00:04:26,544
I'm gonna stick around, actually.

94
00:04:26,546 --> 00:04:28,613
Finished all my cases this morning.

95
00:04:28,615 --> 00:04:30,581
Damn, that was fast.

96
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:32,116
That was a poor choice of words.

97
00:04:32,118 --> 00:04:34,452
You do know it's okay to ease back into

98
00:04:34,454 --> 00:04:36,153
the way you used to do things, right?

99
00:04:36,155 --> 00:04:39,757
Well, this is the only
way I can fight crime.

100
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,794
If I'm not The Flash,
that's what I got to do.

101
00:05:05,652 --> 00:05:07,818
You need to eat.

102
00:05:10,957 --> 00:05:12,790
Caitlin.

103
00:05:12,792 --> 00:05:17,061
If you want to speak to
me, then take off that mask.

104
00:05:18,965 --> 00:05:20,698
Does this make you feel better?

105
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:24,669
Nothing you could ever do
would make me feel better.

106
00:05:24,671 --> 00:05:27,371
You don't need to be afraid.

107
00:05:27,373 --> 00:05:29,173
I'm not gonna hurt you.

108
00:05:30,777 --> 00:05:33,377
I care too much about you to do that.

109
00:05:33,379 --> 00:05:37,248
You only care about yourself...

110
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,749
Hunter.

111
00:05:38,751 --> 00:05:41,118
Hunter.

112
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,687
You're gonna want to see this, son.

113
00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:44,155
No!

114
00:05:44,157 --> 00:05:47,224
I know you think that I'm a monster.

115
00:05:47,226 --> 00:05:48,693
I understand why.

116
00:05:52,732 --> 00:05:54,398
But that'll change.

117
00:05:56,436 --> 00:05:59,970
- Please, Cait...
- Do not call me that.

118
00:05:59,972 --> 00:06:01,472
Why are you keeping me here?

119
00:06:01,474 --> 00:06:02,740
You're cured.

120
00:06:02,742 --> 00:06:04,175
You don't need me for anything.

121
00:06:04,177 --> 00:06:07,878
You're here because I love you.

122
00:06:09,782 --> 00:06:13,050
It may take a while,
but someday, you'll start

123
00:06:13,052 --> 00:06:16,087
feeling that way about me again, too.

124
00:06:19,559 --> 00:06:22,626
Make yourself at home.

125
00:06:22,628 --> 00:06:23,861
You're gonna be here a while.

126
00:06:23,863 --> 00:06:26,630
Okay?

127
00:07:04,871 --> 00:07:06,871
I-I don't understand.

128
00:07:06,873 --> 00:07:11,776
Well, hello, doppelganger of mine.

129
00:07:11,778 --> 00:07:13,744
What do you know?

130
00:07:13,746 --> 00:07:16,447
I can still pull off brunette.

131
00:07:21,187 --> 00:07:23,187
Dad.

132
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:25,156
Oh, hey, son. What a surprise.

133
00:07:25,158 --> 00:07:26,490
What's up?

134
00:07:26,492 --> 00:07:29,260
Uh, I wanted to ask you about something.

135
00:07:29,262 --> 00:07:31,595
Someone, actually.

136
00:07:31,597 --> 00:07:34,265
Uh, The Flash.

137
00:07:34,267 --> 00:07:36,200
What about him?

138
00:07:36,202 --> 00:07:40,237
Well, he showed up at my
street race when Iris got hurt.

139
00:07:40,239 --> 00:07:43,774
Then, when that man-shark
thing attacked our house.

140
00:07:43,776 --> 00:07:46,477
And when Zoom took me, he said,

141
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,147
“Someone The Flash
knew cared about me”"

142
00:07:50,149 --> 00:07:54,585
Yeah, it doesn't take a genius
to figure out that that's you.

143
00:07:54,587 --> 00:07:57,154
You want me to tell you who he is?

144
00:07:57,156 --> 00:07:59,890
- I can't do that.
- No, I know. I know.

145
00:07:59,892 --> 00:08:02,460
I was actually hoping that you
could set up a meeting for me.

146
00:08:02,462 --> 00:08:05,596
A meeting? Between you and him?

147
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:07,331
I don't know if I can
do that either, Wally.

148
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,066
Well, why not?

149
00:08:09,068 --> 00:08:10,100
Joe?

150
00:08:10,102 --> 00:08:11,435
Singh wants to see you.

151
00:08:11,437 --> 00:08:13,671
Okay. Um...

152
00:08:13,673 --> 00:08:18,442
Look, maybe one day,
but, I mean, not now.

153
00:08:18,444 --> 00:08:20,678
I got to get to work.

154
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,979
See you at home?

155
00:08:21,981 --> 00:08:23,481
All right.

156
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,009
The laser tag club's in 2D.

157
00:08:36,009 --> 00:08:37,159
The?

158
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:38,396
Oh, no.

159
00:08:38,397 --> 00:08:41,131
Uh, I'm looking for Jesse.

160
00:08:41,133 --> 00:08:43,634
Come on in.

161
00:08:43,636 --> 00:08:47,137
Thanks.

162
00:08:47,139 --> 00:08:49,607
Jesse!

163
00:08:49,609 --> 00:08:53,077
You're, like, the first person
who's ever come to visit her.

164
00:08:53,079 --> 00:08:58,082
- What? Oh.
- How'd you find me?

165
00:08:58,084 --> 00:08:59,483
Jess...

166
00:08:59,485 --> 00:09:01,819
Uh, cellular dead zone.

167
00:09:01,821 --> 00:09:03,888
I told you, I'd find
you wherever you went.

168
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:06,857
Wait, so you're a runaway?

169
00:09:06,859 --> 00:09:08,826
So you're her dad?

170
00:09:08,828 --> 00:09:11,662
Great, let me know if I
need to find a new roommate.

171
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,568
Listen.

172
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:19,069
We need to go.

173
00:09:19,071 --> 00:09:20,671
So, what?

174
00:09:20,673 --> 00:09:22,940
You think I'll be safer with you?

175
00:09:22,942 --> 00:09:27,478
Yes.

176
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,013
Yeah, I think I'm gonna pass.

177
00:09:29,015 --> 00:09:30,214
Jesse.

178
00:09:30,216 --> 00:09:32,716
We need to leave.

179
00:09:32,718 --> 00:09:34,151
No, okay?

180
00:09:34,153 --> 00:09:36,253
No, I'm not going anywhere
with you ever again.

181
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,889
You are...

182
00:09:38,891 --> 00:09:41,058
you are in danger.

183
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,860
Do you understand? You
are in grave danger.

184
00:09:42,862 --> 00:09:44,061
I know!

185
00:09:44,063 --> 00:09:46,263
I'm in danger because of you.

186
00:09:46,265 --> 00:09:48,599
- Because of me?
- Yeah!

187
00:09:48,601 --> 00:09:51,035
Okay, everything that's
happened, it's your fault.

188
00:09:51,037 --> 00:09:53,103
Zoom hunting us, the metas...

189
00:09:53,105 --> 00:09:54,605
moving here.

190
00:09:54,607 --> 00:09:55,839
I'm done with it.

191
00:09:55,841 --> 00:09:57,374
Okay, you wanted me to start a new life,

192
00:09:57,376 --> 00:09:59,209
and that is exactly
what I'm trying to do.

193
00:09:59,211 --> 00:10:02,880
- No, Jess... Jess...
- You killed a man!

194
00:10:02,882 --> 00:10:06,517
I can't just forgive you for that.

195
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:09,053
And I may be afraid of Zoom, but...

196
00:10:09,055 --> 00:10:11,789
but I am just as afraid of you.

197
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:14,024
Please, just... just go.

198
00:10:56,751 --> 00:11:00,251
And a new report shows that petty
crimes have risen slightly this month,

199
00:11:00,251 --> 00:11:03,085
sparking concerns that The Flash...

200
00:11:03,224 --> 00:11:04,623
Don't watch that.

201
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:08,158
Cisco, everybody's gonna realize sooner
or later that I don't have my speed.

202
00:11:08,298 --> 00:11:09,236
The later the better.

203
00:11:09,236 --> 00:11:10,729
The last thing we need is
every criminal in the city

204
00:11:10,731 --> 00:11:12,197
thinking they're untouchable, right?

205
00:11:13,534 --> 00:11:15,868
- What is that?
- Case in point.

206
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,703
What?

207
00:11:17,705 --> 00:11:18,837
What is that?

208
00:11:20,574 --> 00:11:23,008
- It's Harry.
- What about Harry?

209
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:24,877
The camera in the lab
van recorded an accident.

210
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:26,812
See, this is my version of crash assist.

211
00:11:26,814 --> 00:11:28,914
It's like those Russian
dash cams, but, you know,

212
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:32,651
without attack helicopters
and bad pop music on the radio.

213
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,361
That does not look like an accident.

214
00:11:42,363 --> 00:11:45,264
First Caitlin's taken, now Wells.

215
00:11:48,068 --> 00:11:49,668
This is where he got taken,

216
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,536
but there aren't any
traffic cams in that area.

217
00:11:51,538 --> 00:11:53,372
I'm gonna head out there,
see what I can find.

218
00:11:53,374 --> 00:11:56,108
I'll analyze this footage and see
if we can figure out who this is.

219
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,509
All right.

220
00:11:57,511 --> 00:11:59,711
Wait, what was the last
place the van stopped?

221
00:11:59,713 --> 00:12:03,015
Woodmen and Shore for about 15 minutes
before heading back to Central City.

222
00:12:03,017 --> 00:12:04,750
- Why?
- That's where Jesse must be.

223
00:12:04,752 --> 00:12:07,753
She should know if something's
happened to her dad.

224
00:12:07,755 --> 00:12:08,854
Iris, hey.

225
00:12:08,856 --> 00:12:11,189
I need your help with something.

226
00:12:11,191 --> 00:12:14,092
You're... Killer Frost.

227
00:12:14,094 --> 00:12:16,428
And you're Caitlin Snow.

228
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:19,898
Your little friend, Cisco,
wouldn't shut up about you.

229
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,768
Made you out to be some kind of a saint.

230
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:26,071
So tell me, why hide the girls?

231
00:12:26,073 --> 00:12:28,974
I mean, you've seen our body, right?

232
00:12:30,911 --> 00:12:34,046
If I could get my powers to
work through this carbine wall,

233
00:12:34,048 --> 00:12:38,016
the first thing I
would do is shut him up!

234
00:12:38,018 --> 00:12:39,151
Who is he?

235
00:12:39,153 --> 00:12:41,320
Don't know, don't care.

236
00:12:41,322 --> 00:12:43,822
But if he's here, Zoom must need

237
00:12:43,824 --> 00:12:47,726
something from him.

238
00:12:47,728 --> 00:12:50,162
So what does Zoom need you for?

239
00:12:50,164 --> 00:12:53,832
That is an excellent question, Caity.

240
00:12:53,834 --> 00:12:56,401
You know, I've been asking
myself the same thing.

241
00:12:56,403 --> 00:12:59,471
But doesn't matter now.

242
00:12:59,473 --> 00:13:02,441
I'm not gonna stick around much longer.

243
00:13:02,443 --> 00:13:04,409
Wait, I thought you said
your powers don't work

244
00:13:04,411 --> 00:13:05,811
inside this cell?

245
00:13:05,813 --> 00:13:08,280
They don't. You're right.

246
00:13:08,282 --> 00:13:10,916
So you're gonna help me get out of here.

247
00:13:10,918 --> 00:13:12,751
Why would I help you?

248
00:13:12,753 --> 00:13:14,653
Listen, honey, there's no way you are

249
00:13:14,655 --> 00:13:17,689
making it down that
cliff all by yourself.

250
00:13:17,691 --> 00:13:19,958
So let's make a deal.

251
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:23,528
You get me out of this box,

252
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:25,464
and I'll help you get home.

253
00:13:25,466 --> 00:13:29,835
Might even throw in some
wardrobe tips for free.

254
00:13:29,837 --> 00:13:33,171
So what do you say, Caitlin?

255
00:13:33,173 --> 00:13:34,906
Do we have a deal?

256
00:13:44,718 --> 00:13:47,386
I don't understand.

257
00:13:47,388 --> 00:13:49,654
There's nothing around here.

258
00:13:49,656 --> 00:13:52,324
What did the van hit?

259
00:13:52,326 --> 00:13:53,959
I don't know.

260
00:13:53,961 --> 00:13:57,229
Something strong enough to
exert an equal amount of force

261
00:13:57,231 --> 00:13:59,931
back on the van.

262
00:14:02,836 --> 00:14:05,070
Someone was definitely here, though.

263
00:14:05,072 --> 00:14:08,006
You think maybe a meta-human?

264
00:14:08,008 --> 00:14:10,008
Yeah.

265
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:12,210
And if it's a meta that's after Wells...

266
00:14:12,212 --> 00:14:14,279
Then they could be from Earth-2.

267
00:14:14,281 --> 00:14:16,348
Probably.

268
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:17,983
We got to get Jesse.

269
00:14:17,985 --> 00:14:19,584
Find Wells. Fast.

270
00:14:43,977 --> 00:14:46,912
Dr. Harrison Wells.

271
00:14:46,914 --> 00:14:49,981
Yup. And who are you?

272
00:14:49,983 --> 00:14:52,417
Name's Griffin Grey.

273
00:14:52,419 --> 00:14:55,087
Griffin Grey?

274
00:14:55,089 --> 00:14:56,555
Do I know you?

275
00:14:56,557 --> 00:14:59,257
Nope. But you should.

276
00:14:59,259 --> 00:15:02,027
I'm one of your mistakes.

277
00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:06,031
One of your sins coming home to roost.

278
00:15:06,033 --> 00:15:08,133
All right, you think I...

279
00:15:08,135 --> 00:15:09,601
I'm from...

280
00:15:09,603 --> 00:15:11,436
I'm not... I'm not who you think I am.

281
00:15:11,438 --> 00:15:14,506
I know exactly who you are.

282
00:15:14,508 --> 00:15:19,044
And you're gonna fix what your
particle accelerator did to me.

283
00:15:19,046 --> 00:15:20,879
What did the accelerator do to you?

284
00:15:34,027 --> 00:15:35,260
That.

285
00:15:35,262 --> 00:15:37,629
Well, that's impressive.

286
00:15:37,631 --> 00:15:39,698
And all things considered,
I don't know that having

287
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,667
that kind of strength is the worst
thing you could have been given.

288
00:15:42,669 --> 00:15:45,470
Yeah, that's what I thought at first.

289
00:15:45,472 --> 00:15:48,740
And it was a lot of fun.

290
00:15:48,742 --> 00:15:51,910
Till I learned it did
something else to me, too.

291
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,047
That's me.

292
00:15:56,049 --> 00:15:57,983
Last year.

293
00:15:57,985 --> 00:16:00,318
You're...

294
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,953
you're ageing.

295
00:16:01,955 --> 00:16:05,690
If this keeps happening,
I'll be dead in a few months.

296
00:16:05,692 --> 00:16:07,926
How old are you, Griffin?

297
00:16:10,564 --> 00:16:12,430
I'm 18.

298
00:16:14,535 --> 00:16:19,771
Look.

299
00:16:19,773 --> 00:16:22,908
I'm sorry this is happening to you.

300
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:25,544
But there's nothing I can do to fix it.

301
00:16:25,546 --> 00:16:28,280
Well, that sucks.

302
00:16:28,282 --> 00:16:31,650
'Cause if you can't figure out
a way to help me, Dr. Wells...

303
00:16:33,887 --> 00:16:35,287
You're gonna die soon, too.

304
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:47,479
- I never should have left.
- No, this isn't your fault.

305
00:16:48,503 --> 00:16:49,835
Do we know what took him?

306
00:16:49,837 --> 00:16:51,437
That's where things get interesting.

307
00:16:51,439 --> 00:16:54,040
That fingerprint that
you guys brought in,

308
00:16:54,042 --> 00:16:55,241
the one from the van, I mean.

309
00:16:55,243 --> 00:16:57,109
Yeah, yeah.

310
00:16:57,111 --> 00:17:00,112
Belongs to this guy.

311
00:17:00,114 --> 00:17:01,447
Griffin Grey.

312
00:17:01,449 --> 00:17:03,482
A senior at Central City High School?

313
00:17:03,484 --> 00:17:05,351
No, wait, I've seen this
kid's picture before.

314
00:17:05,353 --> 00:17:07,053
He went missing, like, six months ago.

315
00:17:07,055 --> 00:17:08,254
That's right.

316
00:17:08,256 --> 00:17:09,622
That doesn't make any sense.

317
00:17:09,624 --> 00:17:11,090
An 18-year-old
didn't kidnap Wells.

318
00:17:11,092 --> 00:17:14,060
That's what I thought at first,
but feast your eyes on this.

319
00:17:18,866 --> 00:17:21,500
Whoa. It's the same guy.

320
00:17:21,502 --> 00:17:23,402
Yeah, the blood sample confirms it.

321
00:17:23,404 --> 00:17:24,537
How is that even possible?

322
00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:26,205
I'm not sure yet.

323
00:17:26,207 --> 00:17:28,641
Without Caitlin here, I
can't really analyze the cells

324
00:17:28,643 --> 00:17:30,876
on a molecular level to see
what we're dealing with here.

325
00:17:30,878 --> 00:17:32,645
You know, I might
actually be able to help.

326
00:17:32,647 --> 00:17:34,080
How?

327
00:17:34,082 --> 00:17:35,393
Bio-chem was one of
my majors in college.

328
00:17:35,393 --> 00:17:36,716
One of your majors?

329
00:17:36,718 --> 00:17:40,252
- How many did you have?
- Five.

330
00:17:40,254 --> 00:17:41,821
What, is that not common here?

331
00:17:41,823 --> 00:17:43,989
Girl, no, that is not common anywhere.

332
00:17:43,991 --> 00:17:45,591
All right, let's search for that Grey,

333
00:17:45,593 --> 00:17:47,093
see what we come up with.

334
00:17:47,095 --> 00:17:48,928
I'll see if facial
recognition brings him up

335
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:51,397
and I'll have Joe check CCPD's database.

336
00:17:51,399 --> 00:17:53,032
Cool.

337
00:17:53,034 --> 00:17:54,900
See what you can do.

338
00:17:57,038 --> 00:17:59,505
Tick tock, tick tock.

339
00:17:59,507 --> 00:18:01,107
I'm going as fast as I can.

340
00:18:01,109 --> 00:18:02,908
Well, you better go faster.

341
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:04,677
Zoom will be back any minute.

342
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:06,645
I could just leave
you in there, you know.

343
00:18:06,647 --> 00:18:08,180
Oh.

344
00:18:08,182 --> 00:18:12,685
But you want to go home so badly.

345
00:18:12,687 --> 00:18:15,421
So how did this happen to you?

346
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:19,759
Woke up one day, cold, pale.

347
00:18:19,761 --> 00:18:21,794
Thought I was sick.

348
00:18:21,796 --> 00:18:25,598
Turns out it was
something else entirely.

349
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,199
You got hit by the dark matter from

350
00:18:27,201 --> 00:18:28,734
the particle accelerator explosion?

351
00:18:28,736 --> 00:18:30,102
Yes.

352
00:18:30,104 --> 00:18:34,206
Right after I flunked out of med school.

353
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:36,876
Had to move back in with my mother.

354
00:18:36,878 --> 00:18:38,677
That couldn't have been fun.

355
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:41,247
If she's anything like mine, I mean.

356
00:18:41,249 --> 00:18:42,448
Why?

357
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:45,317
Is yours a frigid narcnasist, too?

358
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:46,585
Cold as ice.

359
00:18:46,587 --> 00:18:48,087
Yeah.

360
00:18:48,089 --> 00:18:51,123
Mom was like that ever
since Charlie died.

361
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:52,725
Who's Charlie?

362
00:18:52,727 --> 00:18:53,893
My brother.

363
00:18:53,895 --> 00:18:56,562
- I never had a brother.
- No?

364
00:18:56,564 --> 00:19:00,733
Then why was Mom such
a bitch on your Earth?

365
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:02,735
Honestly, I couldn't say.

366
00:19:05,473 --> 00:19:06,772
So...

367
00:19:06,774 --> 00:19:10,843
how is this going to get me out of here?

368
00:19:10,845 --> 00:19:13,779
The electrical current in
the cable should heat up

369
00:19:13,781 --> 00:19:17,450
the carbine, which in turn
should speed up the electrons

370
00:19:17,452 --> 00:19:18,851
and the faster they go...

371
00:19:18,853 --> 00:19:21,954
The weaker its molecular
structure becomes.

372
00:19:21,956 --> 00:19:24,290
Exactly.

373
00:19:24,292 --> 00:19:27,526
I studied every once in a while.

374
00:19:27,528 --> 00:19:30,629
Well, when it gets hot enough,
it should make the carbine

375
00:19:30,631 --> 00:19:32,565
as fragile as glass.

376
00:19:32,567 --> 00:19:35,868
And then we can both get out of here.

377
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:48,380
- Wally.
- Hey, Joe.

378
00:19:48,382 --> 00:19:49,882
What's up?

379
00:19:49,884 --> 00:19:52,318
You look like you got
something on your mind.

380
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,688
Yeah, I do.

381
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:57,957
Please don't tell me you
drove all the way over here

382
00:19:57,959 --> 00:20:00,626
to ask about The Flash again.

383
00:20:00,628 --> 00:20:02,328
It's...

384
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:04,163
it's not happening, Wally.

385
00:20:04,165 --> 00:20:06,665
But... it's just one time.
That's all I'm asking.

386
00:20:06,667 --> 00:20:08,367
It's impossible.

387
00:20:08,369 --> 00:20:10,903
He saved my life, Joe.

388
00:20:10,905 --> 00:20:14,073
I owe him a thank you.

389
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:18,811
Look.

390
00:20:18,813 --> 00:20:22,882
I've been reckless my whole life.

391
00:20:22,884 --> 00:20:25,584
Racing cars, pushing limits.

392
00:20:25,586 --> 00:20:28,654
I did everything at full speed
without a care in the world.

393
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:35,060
But it wasn't until Zoom took me that...

394
00:20:35,062 --> 00:20:38,230
that I really thought I was gonna die.

395
00:20:38,232 --> 00:20:40,699
And I was going to die,

396
00:20:40,701 --> 00:20:44,703
if The Flash didn't do what he did.

397
00:20:44,705 --> 00:20:48,107
He gave up his powers to save me.

398
00:20:48,109 --> 00:20:50,709
A guy he didn't even know.

399
00:20:50,711 --> 00:20:53,479
No one's ever done anything
like that for me before.

400
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:59,585
I need to tell him how
much that means to me.

401
00:21:04,158 --> 00:21:06,892
Well, all right.

402
00:21:06,894 --> 00:21:08,527
Uh...

403
00:21:08,529 --> 00:21:11,730
just give me a little while.

404
00:21:11,732 --> 00:21:14,066
I'll see what I can do.

405
00:21:16,203 --> 00:21:17,670
I got to go.

406
00:21:25,913 --> 00:21:28,447
Hey, Dad.

407
00:21:28,449 --> 00:21:30,049
Thanks.

408
00:21:38,092 --> 00:21:40,426
- Yo!
- In here.

409
00:21:40,428 --> 00:21:41,694
I got your text. What's up?

410
00:21:41,696 --> 00:21:43,228
All right, facial recognition

411
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:45,130
just picked up Grey
breaking into Ace Chemical

412
00:21:45,132 --> 00:21:46,599
down on Newbury Road.

413
00:21:46,601 --> 00:21:48,334
- Is my dad with him?
- I don't know yet.

414
00:21:48,336 --> 00:21:50,636
- But we have to go.
- Uh, you sure about that?

415
00:21:50,638 --> 00:21:52,571
Yeah, I'm sure. Look...
we can't just sit here.

416
00:21:52,573 --> 00:21:54,306
Regardless of whether
I have my speed or not,

417
00:21:54,308 --> 00:21:56,241
I have to try to help.
That's never gonna change.

418
00:21:56,243 --> 00:21:57,810
Okay.

419
00:21:57,812 --> 00:21:59,578
I'm with you, but we're
gonna need some backup.

420
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,046
- Joe's on his way.
- I'm coming with.

421
00:22:01,048 --> 00:22:02,715
No, look, please just stay here.

422
00:22:02,717 --> 00:22:04,383
We don't know what
we're dealing with yet.

423
00:22:04,385 --> 00:22:06,418
Just finish running the
test on the blood sample.

424
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,921
I'm sorry. Thank you, Jesse.

425
00:22:32,713 --> 00:22:34,480
Griffin Grey, CCPD!

426
00:22:34,482 --> 00:22:36,482
Stay right there.

427
00:22:36,484 --> 00:22:39,918
The man that you
kidnapped, Harrison Wells,

428
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,286
you need to let him go.

429
00:22:41,288 --> 00:22:43,656
I can't do that. Not yet.

430
00:22:43,658 --> 00:22:45,257
Then we'll have to do this the hard way.

431
00:22:45,259 --> 00:22:47,192
I guess so.

432
00:22:55,302 --> 00:22:57,202
Okay, He-Man's got some power.

433
00:23:01,275 --> 00:23:02,474
And accuracy.

434
00:23:02,476 --> 00:23:04,009
All right, keep him distracted, okay?

435
00:23:04,011 --> 00:23:07,046
What? Barry! Barry!

436
00:23:07,048 --> 00:23:08,781
I can do this all night.

437
00:23:10,384 --> 00:23:12,851
We just want Wells. Just let him go.

438
00:23:12,853 --> 00:23:14,853
Not until I'm done with him!

439
00:23:31,539 --> 00:23:34,006
Too slow.

440
00:23:44,485 --> 00:23:46,485
- Barry!
- Hey.

441
00:23:46,487 --> 00:23:48,320
Oh, I think I need
some medical attention.

442
00:23:55,738 --> 00:23:58,105
So his genes have actually mutated.

443
00:23:58,107 --> 00:24:00,307
I ran the DNA from the
blood sample Barry found,

444
00:24:00,309 --> 00:24:04,545
and the functional myostatin in
his cells is essentially gone.

445
00:24:04,547 --> 00:24:06,346
I mean, giving him super-strength.

446
00:24:06,348 --> 00:24:07,681
Guys, there's something else.

447
00:24:07,683 --> 00:24:10,350
Um, I saw him age.

448
00:24:10,352 --> 00:24:11,719
Right in front of me.

449
00:24:11,721 --> 00:24:14,955
He's suffering from oxidated stress.

450
00:24:14,957 --> 00:24:17,024
It means the protein
in the DNA in his body

451
00:24:17,026 --> 00:24:18,859
are being ravaged by oxidants.

452
00:24:18,861 --> 00:24:21,328
So, what, he needs to
up his blueberry intake?

453
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:26,133
No, it means, uh, the
more he exerts himself,

454
00:24:26,135 --> 00:24:28,235
the faster he ages.

455
00:24:28,237 --> 00:24:31,438
So if we can get him to
exert too much energy...

456
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,373
Then he'll become old and weak.

457
00:24:33,375 --> 00:24:35,976
And how do you think
we're gonna do that?

458
00:24:35,978 --> 00:24:37,678
I can't watch you be
a human punching bag

459
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,980
until he turns into Grandpa Simpson.

460
00:24:39,982 --> 00:24:41,982
I think we can fix that.

461
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:45,052
Jesse, I'm gonna need some of
that quick thinking of yours.

462
00:24:45,054 --> 00:24:48,021
Iris.

463
00:24:48,023 --> 00:24:50,023
I got to get back to the station.

464
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,066
You okay?

465
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:04,938
No, not really.

466
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,673
You know, you were the
first person I saved

467
00:25:06,675 --> 00:25:10,310
after I got my powers?

468
00:25:11,714 --> 00:25:14,882
We were out on a walk

469
00:25:14,884 --> 00:25:17,217
and we were talking about Eddie

470
00:25:17,219 --> 00:25:20,788
and how you were with him,
and I was thinking to myself

471
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:25,325
how I missed a lot
while I was in that coma.

472
00:25:25,327 --> 00:25:29,129
And then all of a sudden,
those cars came at us.

473
00:25:29,131 --> 00:25:32,199
And it was like the world froze.

474
00:25:32,201 --> 00:25:34,234
Like... you and I were the only

475
00:25:34,236 --> 00:25:37,504
two people in the world.

476
00:25:37,506 --> 00:25:40,007
I didn't even know what I could do yet,

477
00:25:40,009 --> 00:25:43,210
but I knew that I could save you.

478
00:25:43,212 --> 00:25:45,779
And I did.

479
00:25:46,882 --> 00:25:47,915
And now, I don't know.

480
00:25:47,917 --> 00:25:49,316
I don't...

481
00:25:49,318 --> 00:25:52,953
I just don't even know who I am anymore

482
00:25:52,955 --> 00:25:54,721
or who I'm supposed to be.

483
00:25:57,593 --> 00:25:59,293
Barry, you're supposed
to be the same guy

484
00:25:59,295 --> 00:26:02,729
that you've always been.

485
00:26:02,731 --> 00:26:06,066
Suit or no suit...

486
00:26:06,068 --> 00:26:08,368
that guy is a hero.

487
00:26:12,908 --> 00:26:16,076
That's everything you asked for.

488
00:26:16,078 --> 00:26:18,445
How do you sleep at night?

489
00:26:18,447 --> 00:26:22,149
Knowing you've destroyed
so many people's lives?

490
00:26:22,151 --> 00:26:24,318
I don't.

491
00:26:26,088 --> 00:26:29,923
Do you have anyone in your
life that you care about?

492
00:26:29,925 --> 00:26:32,159
I have a daughter.

493
00:26:32,161 --> 00:26:35,429
I used to have someone in
my life that I cared about.

494
00:26:37,132 --> 00:26:40,500
My girlfriend, Jenny.

495
00:26:40,502 --> 00:26:44,104
We were gonna get
married, have kids someday.

496
00:26:47,543 --> 00:26:50,811
But after I got hit by that wave

497
00:26:50,813 --> 00:26:53,113
from the particle accelerator,

498
00:26:53,115 --> 00:26:55,315
all my dreams ended.

499
00:26:55,317 --> 00:26:58,418
You know, I see her sometimes,
walking down the street.

500
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:00,354
She doesn't even recognize me.

501
00:27:00,356 --> 00:27:01,922
But why would she?

502
00:27:01,924 --> 00:27:04,224
I look as old as her dad.

503
00:27:06,095 --> 00:27:08,195
- You robbed me of her.
- Griffin.

504
00:27:08,197 --> 00:27:09,830
Stop talking.

505
00:27:09,832 --> 00:27:11,298
So I can concentrate.

506
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,066
Wake up, man.

507
00:27:13,068 --> 00:27:16,703
This city is screwed up because of you.

508
00:27:16,705 --> 00:27:20,140
It was quiet and normal.

509
00:27:20,142 --> 00:27:22,009
Until you rode in on your high horse,

510
00:27:22,011 --> 00:27:25,045
talking about science
and changing the future.

511
00:27:25,047 --> 00:27:28,448
You didn't stop to think about
what your particle accelerator

512
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:30,517
could do to others.
You only thought about

513
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:31,852
what it could do for you.

514
00:27:31,854 --> 00:27:33,520
Enough!

515
00:27:36,091 --> 00:27:37,457
Enough.

516
00:27:37,459 --> 00:27:40,027
I hope it was worth it.

517
00:27:40,029 --> 00:27:41,728
Doc.

518
00:27:48,537 --> 00:27:50,103
Stay away from the wall.

519
00:27:50,105 --> 00:27:52,439
Let's give it a whirl.

520
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:17,864
Well...

521
00:28:17,866 --> 00:28:21,201
looks like you have a little
badass in you, after all.

522
00:28:27,176 --> 00:28:29,643
What are we gonna do about this guy?

523
00:28:29,645 --> 00:28:31,178
Oh, Caity.

524
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:34,214
I don't think he's ever going home.

525
00:28:34,216 --> 00:28:36,249
And neither are you.

526
00:28:37,753 --> 00:28:40,620
What are you doing? I
thought we had a deal.

527
00:28:40,622 --> 00:28:44,424
Ugh, is everyone on
your Earth this gullible?

528
00:28:52,534 --> 00:28:57,037
Heels aren't the best on ice, are they?

529
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:58,472
You know, once I saw you,

530
00:28:58,474 --> 00:29:01,908
I realized why Zoom didn't kill me.

531
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:05,245
Because I look just like you.

532
00:29:05,247 --> 00:29:08,048
Now he won't need me anymore.

533
00:29:23,332 --> 00:29:25,332
No.

534
00:29:25,334 --> 00:29:27,200
I don't.

535
00:29:33,175 --> 00:29:35,342
Try that with him...

536
00:29:35,344 --> 00:29:37,010
he dies, too.

537
00:29:42,151 --> 00:29:45,786
Not picking up anything
from facial recognition.

538
00:29:45,788 --> 00:29:48,622
The only cellular dead zone
I can find is the one in here.

539
00:29:48,624 --> 00:29:50,290
No offense.

540
00:29:50,292 --> 00:29:51,992
No, wait a second, was
he wearing his watch

541
00:29:51,994 --> 00:29:53,326
when he left to get me?

542
00:29:53,328 --> 00:29:54,895
Already tried that. GPS isn't working.

543
00:29:54,897 --> 00:29:57,264
Okay, no, but the
meta-human activity would be.

544
00:29:57,266 --> 00:29:59,332
I mean, the watch is designed
to track metas, right?

545
00:29:59,334 --> 00:30:01,701
And since Griffin Grey is one,
it'll keep sending a message

546
00:30:01,703 --> 00:30:03,203
to a server till it goes through.

547
00:30:03,205 --> 00:30:04,571
But since we're on a different Earth,

548
00:30:04,573 --> 00:30:06,073
it'll never go through.

549
00:30:06,075 --> 00:30:08,842
So it just keeps
sending the same signal.

550
00:30:10,212 --> 00:30:11,912
There he is, Central
City Amusement Park.

551
00:30:11,914 --> 00:30:13,613
Yeah, and I'm coming with this time.

552
00:30:13,615 --> 00:30:15,048
Okay, great, we've found Harry,

553
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:16,450
but how are we gonna stop Grey?

554
00:30:16,452 --> 00:30:18,318
I'm so glad that you asked.

555
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,388
Jesse and I upgraded the
internal lining of the suit.

556
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:24,091
Felicity hooked us up
with some dwarf star alloy.

557
00:30:24,093 --> 00:30:25,492
Wait, dwarf star alloy?

558
00:30:25,494 --> 00:30:28,228
It's the same compound that's used
to protect Ray's A.T.O.M. suit.

559
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:29,396
That's right.

560
00:30:29,398 --> 00:30:31,298
Super strong, super lightweight.

561
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,467
Only thing is, we
couldn't get much of it.

562
00:30:33,469 --> 00:30:35,435
All right, what does that mean?

563
00:30:35,437 --> 00:30:39,306
We could only cover the
chest portion of the suit.

564
00:30:39,308 --> 00:30:40,674
- Oh.
- Yeah, sorry.

565
00:30:40,676 --> 00:30:42,409
Uh, here's the other thing...

566
00:30:42,411 --> 00:30:44,845
Probably not a big deal...
Um, I'm guessing the suit

567
00:30:44,847 --> 00:30:47,314
will only absorb one of Grey's punches.

568
00:30:47,316 --> 00:30:48,682
- Mm.
- Anything more than that,

569
00:30:48,684 --> 00:30:50,283
you'll be like a piñata.

570
00:30:50,285 --> 00:30:51,485
Only it won't be candy
coming out, it'll be...

571
00:30:51,487 --> 00:30:53,553
- Me.
- You're... yeah, you.

572
00:30:53,555 --> 00:30:54,988
Yeah.

573
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:56,490
All right.

574
00:30:56,492 --> 00:31:00,093
Hopefully, one gimme
punch is all I'll need.

575
00:31:06,053 --> 00:31:07,090
All right, then.

576
00:31:10,003 --> 00:31:14,070
Finished.

577
00:31:14,181 --> 00:31:16,503
This is gonna cure me?

578
00:31:16,517 --> 00:31:20,485
As we say in science,
I'm cautiously optimistic.

579
00:31:23,591 --> 00:31:27,226
You know, I learned a lot about
chemistry in the past two years.

580
00:31:27,228 --> 00:31:29,428
Is that right?

581
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:32,431
And I know all you've been
doing is diluting that compound

582
00:31:32,433 --> 00:31:36,001
for the past half hour.

583
00:31:36,003 --> 00:31:37,603
You don't know how to help me, do you?

584
00:31:41,208 --> 00:31:43,942
There is no helping you.

585
00:31:46,447 --> 00:31:49,548
I told you you were gonna
fix me or you were dead!

586
00:32:11,305 --> 00:32:13,939
Why is it that bad guys
always insist on having

587
00:32:13,941 --> 00:32:15,140
the creepiest hideouts?

588
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:17,109
'Cause they crazy.

589
00:32:17,111 --> 00:32:18,076
Right.

590
00:32:20,848 --> 00:32:22,214
Hey, Barry.

591
00:32:22,216 --> 00:32:24,016
Grey's headed your way.

592
00:32:24,018 --> 00:32:25,050
Come on. Hey, come on.

593
00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:33,558
You ready?

594
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,193
Okay, Iris.

595
00:32:35,195 --> 00:32:37,362
On my mark.

596
00:32:37,364 --> 00:32:38,697
Three...

597
00:32:38,699 --> 00:32:40,565
two...

598
00:32:40,567 --> 00:32:41,533
one.

599
00:32:41,535 --> 00:32:43,068
Now!

600
00:32:48,776 --> 00:32:50,108
That all you got, Flash?

601
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:51,276
I just want Dr. Wells.

602
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:52,911
And I wanted him to fix me.

603
00:32:52,913 --> 00:32:54,279
But he can't.

604
00:32:54,281 --> 00:32:57,149
So once I finish you,
I'm gonna finish him.

605
00:32:57,151 --> 00:32:58,116
Freeze!

606
00:33:09,063 --> 00:33:12,331
Come on!

607
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,640
Okay.

608
00:33:21,642 --> 00:33:23,675
I think one more punch, and
we get this guy a walker.

609
00:33:23,677 --> 00:33:24,976
Hey, guys, we got him.

610
00:33:24,978 --> 00:33:26,311
He's over by the Ferris Wheel.

611
00:33:31,452 --> 00:33:33,251
Look.

612
00:33:33,253 --> 00:33:34,386
We can help you.

613
00:33:34,388 --> 00:33:37,289
It's too late for that.

614
00:33:37,291 --> 00:33:41,093
Not everyone got the
powers you did, Flash.

615
00:33:41,095 --> 00:33:43,061
Some of us weren't so lucky.

616
00:33:51,672 --> 00:33:53,004
That was the gimme.

617
00:33:53,006 --> 00:33:54,673
Griffin.

618
00:33:54,675 --> 00:33:57,008
Please stop.

619
00:33:57,010 --> 00:33:59,378
I might be getting older,

620
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:01,646
but I'm stronger than ever.

621
00:34:15,028 --> 00:34:16,762
Barry!

622
00:34:27,641 --> 00:34:29,374
- You okay?
- Ugh.

623
00:34:29,376 --> 00:34:30,776
Yeah, I'm good.

624
00:34:30,778 --> 00:34:33,245
Could've used more of
that dwarf star alloy.

625
00:35:11,285 --> 00:35:14,719
I'm so sorry.

626
00:35:14,721 --> 00:35:16,488
I'm sorry, too.

627
00:35:35,474 --> 00:35:37,656
Home sweet home.

628
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:39,933
Yeah, well...

629
00:35:40,703 --> 00:35:43,670
to be honest, it hasn't felt
much like a home in a while.

630
00:35:43,672 --> 00:35:46,139
At least, certainly not since you left.

631
00:35:46,141 --> 00:35:47,808
Yeah.

632
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:52,179
Look, I'm sorry, Dad, for
just leaving like that.

633
00:35:52,181 --> 00:35:53,613
But...

634
00:35:53,615 --> 00:35:54,981
I mean, you have to understand,

635
00:35:54,983 --> 00:35:59,286
I'm the reason you killed that man.

636
00:35:59,288 --> 00:36:03,223
And that's a really
heavy burden to bear.

637
00:36:04,727 --> 00:36:07,227
I know.

638
00:36:07,229 --> 00:36:11,798
I know... I also know
that what I've done,

639
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,133
it's unforgivable.

640
00:36:20,609 --> 00:36:24,911
When you're mother died, honey...

641
00:36:24,913 --> 00:36:28,148
something inside me broke.

642
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:31,118
I couldn't protect her.

643
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:34,921
And I swore... I swore
on her grave, no less,

644
00:36:34,923 --> 00:36:37,290
that I would protect you,
and then Zoom took you,

645
00:36:37,292 --> 00:36:40,227
and I snapped.

646
00:36:40,229 --> 00:36:42,496
I just snapped.

647
00:36:42,498 --> 00:36:45,732
I couldn't breathe, I...

648
00:36:45,734 --> 00:36:49,603
I couldn't lose the only other person

649
00:36:49,605 --> 00:36:51,238
that I love.

650
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:54,574
Yeah. Yeah, I get that.

651
00:36:54,576 --> 00:36:57,277
I understand why you did everything

652
00:36:57,279 --> 00:36:59,379
you did to protect me.

653
00:36:59,381 --> 00:37:01,214
I mean, you were only missing one day,

654
00:37:01,216 --> 00:37:04,317
and I would have done
anything to find you.

655
00:37:05,687 --> 00:37:07,721
But, I mean...

656
00:37:07,723 --> 00:37:10,557
I need to know that that's
never gonna happen again.

657
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:12,058
Okay?

658
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:14,594
Every time I stay out
late or get in trouble,

659
00:37:14,596 --> 00:37:17,230
you can't track me down or hurt someone

660
00:37:17,232 --> 00:37:18,665
'cause you're trying to save me.

661
00:37:18,667 --> 00:37:20,367
Yeah, but you're in danger.

662
00:37:20,369 --> 00:37:22,302
- I know.
- Okay.

663
00:37:25,741 --> 00:37:29,776
I will make you a promise.

664
00:37:29,778 --> 00:37:35,148
I promise you, I will be the kind
of father that you can be proud of.

665
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:39,486
If you promise me you will
never run away from me again.

666
00:37:40,522 --> 00:37:41,688
Okay.

667
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:44,958
Okay, deal.

668
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,393
I love you, Dad.

669
00:37:46,395 --> 00:37:48,495
I love you, too.

670
00:37:50,666 --> 00:37:52,732
My little Jesse Quick.

671
00:37:57,873 --> 00:38:00,841
Relax, he'll be here.

672
00:38:00,843 --> 00:38:02,209
What should I say?

673
00:38:02,211 --> 00:38:04,177
I don't even know where to start.

674
00:38:04,179 --> 00:38:05,879
Just be honest.

675
00:38:05,881 --> 00:38:07,681
Speak from your heart.

676
00:38:07,683 --> 00:38:09,149
Okay.

677
00:38:09,151 --> 00:38:12,152
Wally West.

678
00:38:12,154 --> 00:38:13,720
I'll see you at home.

679
00:38:15,491 --> 00:38:16,723
You wanted to see me.

680
00:38:16,725 --> 00:38:18,291
Yes. I did.

681
00:38:18,293 --> 00:38:20,227
I mean, I... I do.

682
00:38:24,399 --> 00:38:27,267
I just wanted to thank
you for saving my life.

683
00:38:27,269 --> 00:38:32,239
And I know that that came
at a huge price for you.

684
00:38:32,241 --> 00:38:37,110
And I don't know how
I'll ever repay that.

685
00:38:37,112 --> 00:38:41,681
I guess, what I wanted
to say was that...

686
00:38:41,683 --> 00:38:43,383
I'm not gonna waste this chance

687
00:38:43,385 --> 00:38:46,353
that you've given me.

688
00:38:46,355 --> 00:38:50,423
Thank you.

689
00:38:50,425 --> 00:38:52,392
You're welcome, Wally.

690
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,880
You okay?

691
00:39:13,882 --> 00:39:17,317
Stay away from me.

692
00:39:17,319 --> 00:39:20,687
Killer Frost tried to kill you, Caitlin.

693
00:39:20,689 --> 00:39:24,324
I saved your life.

694
00:39:24,326 --> 00:39:25,792
You should thank me.

695
00:39:25,794 --> 00:39:27,594
I just want to go home.

696
00:39:27,596 --> 00:39:29,529
No.

697
00:39:29,531 --> 00:39:33,333
Stay.

698
00:39:33,335 --> 00:39:35,302
I want to leave!

699
00:39:36,438 --> 00:39:39,372
- Stay, boy!
- No!

700
00:39:41,577 --> 00:39:43,310
Please.

701
00:39:43,312 --> 00:39:45,612
Take me back to my Earth.

702
00:39:48,717 --> 00:39:50,817
You know...

703
00:39:50,819 --> 00:39:52,419
I've always measured my success

704
00:39:52,421 --> 00:39:55,455
by counting the number
of victims I've had.

705
00:39:55,457 --> 00:40:00,393
But now I think I'm
going to widen my scope.

706
00:40:00,395 --> 00:40:04,664
Start counting the number
of Earths I conquer, instead.

707
00:40:06,134 --> 00:40:08,068
You want to go home?

708
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:10,070
Then let's go.

709
00:40:10,072 --> 00:40:11,938
After all, this Earth has already

710
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:13,873
been brought to its knees.

711
00:40:33,161 --> 00:40:35,328
Wow.

712
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:36,429
You're here early.

713
00:40:36,431 --> 00:40:37,731
Yeah.

714
00:40:37,733 --> 00:40:40,667
- I couldn't sleep.
- Me neither.

715
00:40:40,669 --> 00:40:46,373
I know that we just took down
Grey without my powers, but...

716
00:40:46,375 --> 00:40:49,843
I have no idea how to get
Caitlin back without them.

717
00:40:49,845 --> 00:40:52,479
We can't, Allen.

718
00:40:52,481 --> 00:40:55,382
Then what are we gonna do?

719
00:40:57,486 --> 00:40:59,686
You know, Grey...

720
00:40:59,688 --> 00:41:03,857
Grey kidnapped me because

721
00:41:03,859 --> 00:41:08,328
he thought I was the Harrison
Wells from this Earth,

722
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:10,563
and I know he was
talking about another guy,

723
00:41:10,565 --> 00:41:12,999
but I just...

724
00:41:13,001 --> 00:41:16,569
I can't help but think...

725
00:41:16,571 --> 00:41:19,506
I still haven't paid for what I've done.

726
00:41:19,508 --> 00:41:20,807
What does that mean?

727
00:41:25,347 --> 00:41:27,714
I thought, you know, when you...

728
00:41:27,716 --> 00:41:30,417
When we closed the breaches,

729
00:41:30,419 --> 00:41:33,586
I could just forget about
everything I've done,

730
00:41:33,588 --> 00:41:36,589
but I can't.

731
00:41:36,591 --> 00:41:39,959
I realize what I can do.

732
00:41:42,464 --> 00:41:45,198
You are gonna get
your speed back, Allen.

733
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:49,069
And I'm gonna help you do that.

734
00:41:49,071 --> 00:41:50,704
How?

735
00:41:52,874 --> 00:41:56,142
By creating another particle
accelerator explosion.

736
00:41:56,144 --> 00:41:58,778
