1
00:01:29,718 --> 00:01:30,889
Hey!

2
00:01:57,829 --> 00:02:00,415
...a dark and stormy Halloween.

3
00:02:04,503 --> 00:02:07,504
Good evening and welcome
to GC-1 News live at 8:00.

4
00:02:07,506 --> 00:02:11,549
Our top story tonight, just-released polls
have incumbent Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.

5
00:02:11,551 --> 00:02:15,470
and 28-year-old grassroots challenger
Bella Reál in a dead heat.

6
00:02:15,484 --> 00:02:18,276
Things certainly got hot last night 
in their final debate

7
00:02:18,282 --> 00:02:20,509
before next Tuesday's election.

8
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:24,729
Now, my young opponent here wants
to gut the Gotham Renewal Program,

9
00:02:24,731 --> 00:02:26,642
established by the great Thomas Wayne.

10
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:29,400
Cutting funds from vital projects
like our sea wall

11
00:02:29,403 --> 00:02:30,982
and the safety net
for those who need it.

12
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,983
The Renewal Program is broken.

13
00:02:32,984 --> 00:02:36,530
This city's been renewing for 20 years.
Look where it's gotten us.

14
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:39,616
Crime has skyrocketed. Murder
and drug use are at historic highs.

15
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:40,648
Now wait... Now hang on.

16
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,781
We have a masked vigilante 
running the street.

17
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:43,914
Under my administration,

18
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:47,707
the Gotham PD has dealt major blows
to organized crime and drug trafficking.

19
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:51,455
The Salvatore Maroni case 
was the biggest drug bust in city history.

20
00:02:51,466 --> 00:02:54,650
But drops and other drugs are
still rampant. It's gotten worse.

21
00:02:54,656 --> 00:02:56,758
I'm not saying there isn't work to do.
But listen...

22
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,804
I have a beautiful wife 
and young son, okay?

23
00:02:58,807 --> 00:02:59,861
And I will not rest-

24
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:05,727
Hey.

25
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:09,815
Yeah, I'm watching it now.

26
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,760
Why is she still tied?

27
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:24,288
But I thought we were getting
a bump in the new Post poll.

28
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,007
Okay, you know what?
I can't watch this anymore.

29
00:03:34,009 --> 00:03:35,886
Just call me in the morning, okay?

30
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:41,428
...who still believes in everything 
this city can do.

31
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,220
We need a leader, Mr. Mitchell,
not a cheerleader.

32
00:03:44,227 --> 00:03:46,897
And someone who will
tell the people the truth.

33
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,642
<i>Thursday, October 31st.</i>

34
00:05:21,533 --> 00:05:24,286
<i>The city streets are crowded
for the holiday.</i>

35
00:05:27,456 --> 00:05:29,124
<i>Even with the rain.</i>

36
00:05:32,627 --> 00:05:36,663
<i>Hidden in the chaos is the element,</i>

37
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,851
<i>waiting to strike like snakes.</i>

38
00:05:40,594 --> 00:05:42,095
<i>But I'm there too.</i>

39
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:44,468
<i>Watching.</i>

40
00:05:46,433 --> 00:05:50,854
<i>Two years of nights have turned me
into a nocturnal animal.</i>

41
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,985
<i>I must choose my targets carefully.</i>

42
00:06:12,667 --> 00:06:14,667
- Come on! Give me the money.
- Okay.

43
00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:17,378
- Let's go! Let's go!
- All right, all right!

44
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,882
<i>It's a big city.</i>

45
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:25,135
<i>I can't be everywhere.</i>

46
00:06:35,816 --> 00:06:37,734
<i>But they don't know where I am.</i>

47
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:44,613
Look at this guy, man.

48
00:06:49,996 --> 00:06:50,831
Boom!

49
00:06:51,123 --> 00:06:52,165
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

50
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,836
So good, man.
That's what I'm talking about!

51
00:06:57,838 --> 00:06:59,387
Yo, let's see your hits.

52
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:01,466
That's you.

53
00:07:21,692 --> 00:07:25,762
<i>We have a signal now.
For when I'm needed.</i>

54
00:07:27,576 --> 00:07:29,828
<i>But when that light hits the sky,</i>

55
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,637
<i>it's not just a call.</i>

56
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,622
<i>It's a warning.</i>

57
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:38,598
<i>To them.</i>

58
00:07:48,346 --> 00:07:49,556
<i>Fear...</i>

59
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,599
<i>...is a tool.</i>

60
00:08:05,781 --> 00:08:08,950
Are you out of your mind?
Watch where you're goin', drophead!

61
00:08:20,796 --> 00:08:23,340
<i>They think I'm hiding in the shadows.</i>

62
00:08:26,301 --> 00:08:27,302
Come on!

63
00:08:35,641 --> 00:08:37,560
<i>But I am the shadows.</i>

64
00:08:56,415 --> 00:08:57,999
- Come on, come on.
- Whoo!

65
00:08:59,376 --> 00:09:00,542
- Hey, go on, man! Go!
- Get him!

66
00:09:00,544 --> 00:09:02,003
- Come on, man!
- What are you doin'?

67
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,211
Help!

68
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:05,489
Somebody help me!

69
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:08,215
Help, help!

70
00:09:15,183 --> 00:09:16,393
Where you goin', huh?

71
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:22,104
Come on.

72
00:09:22,106 --> 00:09:23,774
Come on, man. Break it.

73
00:09:25,941 --> 00:09:27,861
You can't move, huh?

74
00:09:27,863 --> 00:09:29,573
Now knock his ass out.

75
00:09:29,575 --> 00:09:31,285
Showtime. Showtime, man.

76
00:09:31,895 --> 00:09:32,980
Come on, man.

77
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,241
Come on. Do it, man.

78
00:10:09,654 --> 00:10:11,281
You see this guy?

79
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,036
The hell are you supposed to be?

80
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,433
I'm vengeance.

81
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:41,478
Holy shit. It's him.

82
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:08,296
Hey, man. No, no, no!

83
00:11:50,046 --> 00:11:51,423
Please don't hurt me.

84
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:29,211
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

85
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,838
Police action.

86
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:33,963
He's with me, Officer.

87
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:37,841
Are you kidding me, sir?

88
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:40,427
You're gonna let him in here?

89
00:12:41,264 --> 00:12:44,059
Martinez, let him through.

90
00:12:57,697 --> 00:12:59,449
Goddamn freak.

91
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,425
What do we know?

92
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:28,672
Detective?

93
00:13:28,684 --> 00:13:30,311
Sorry, Lieutenant.

94
00:13:31,231 --> 00:13:35,736
We got blunt force trauma.
Lacerations on the head.

95
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,570
He got hit a lot of times. And hard.

96
00:13:42,826 --> 00:13:44,453
All this blood is from his head?

97
00:13:44,783 --> 00:13:45,784
No.

98
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,460
Excuse me.

99
00:13:53,754 --> 00:13:55,630
Most of it's from his hand.

100
00:14:01,094 --> 00:14:02,137
Thumb was severed.

101
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,347
Killer may have taken it as a trophy.

102
00:14:06,349 --> 00:14:08,268
He was alive when it was cut off.

103
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:10,851
Ecchymosis...

104
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,604
around the wound.

105
00:14:28,911 --> 00:14:33,001
Security detail downstairs said
the family was out trick-or-treatin'.

106
00:14:34,503 --> 00:14:36,713
The mayor was up here alone.

107
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:41,715
Killer may have come through the skylight.

108
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,013
You said there was a card.

109
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:51,599
Yeah.

110
00:15:01,822 --> 00:15:04,866
"From your secret friend. Whoo?

111
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:07,824
"Haven't a clue?

112
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:10,201
"Let's play a game, just me and you.

113
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:13,872
"What does a liar do when he's dead?"

114
00:15:15,252 --> 00:15:17,337
There's a cipher too.

115
00:15:24,094 --> 00:15:25,971
Any of this mean anything to you?

116
00:15:28,515 --> 00:15:29,724
What's going on here?

117
00:15:32,662 --> 00:15:34,263
I asked him to come, Pete.

118
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:35,958
This is a crime scene.

119
00:15:35,978 --> 00:15:38,435
It's Mitchell, for chrissakes!

120
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,439
I got the press downstairs.

121
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,403
You know, I cut you a lot of slack, Jim,
'cause we got history.

122
00:15:43,405 --> 00:15:45,240
But this is way over the line.

123
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:50,990
Wait. He's involved in this?

124
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:53,075
- No, he's not involved.
- How do you know?

125
00:15:53,081 --> 00:15:56,079
He's a goddamn vigilante!
He could be a suspect!

126
00:15:56,081 --> 00:15:57,911
What are you doin' to me?
We used to be partners.

127
00:15:57,913 --> 00:15:59,711
I'm just trying to find
the connection, Pete.

128
00:15:59,713 --> 00:16:01,161
He lies still.

129
00:16:02,758 --> 00:16:03,759
Excuse me?

130
00:16:05,302 --> 00:16:06,386
The riddle.

131
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:10,345
What does a liar do when he's dead?
He lies still.

132
00:16:19,524 --> 00:16:21,026
Oh, Jesus.

133
00:16:24,193 --> 00:16:26,988
This must be your favorite night
of the year, huh, pal?

134
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:29,823
Happy fuckin' Halloween.

135
00:16:30,702 --> 00:16:32,329
Excuse me, Commissioner.

136
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:35,037
They're ready for your statement.

137
00:16:39,127 --> 00:16:40,837
I want him outta here.

138
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:42,460
Now!

139
00:16:49,137 --> 00:16:50,347
Come on.

140
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:04,191
Yeah.

141
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:06,944
The kid found him.

142
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:15,035
Was there anyone else
in the house when you arrived?

143
00:17:31,471 --> 00:17:33,640
We really gotta go, man.

144
00:17:39,229 --> 00:17:42,941
Tonight, a son lost a father.

145
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:45,091
A wife lost a husband.

146
00:17:46,445 --> 00:17:47,988
And I lost a friend.

147
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:51,693
Mayor Mitchell was a fighter for the city,

148
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,615
and I will not rest 
until his killer is found.

149
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,369
This was a truly senseless crime,

150
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,666
and we are actively pursuing
every investigative lead we have

151
00:18:01,668 --> 00:18:05,837
in order to identify the perpetrator
and hunt him down.

152
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:07,068
I've spoken to the governor...

153
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:11,592
<i>I wish I could say I'm making a difference,
but I don't know.</i>

154
00:18:17,595 --> 00:18:20,473
<i>Murder, robberies, assault.</i>

155
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,561
<i>Two years later, they're all up.</i>

156
00:18:23,398 --> 00:18:24,857
<i>And now this.</i>

157
00:18:26,825 --> 00:18:28,483
<i>The city's eating itself.</i>

158
00:18:31,198 --> 00:18:32,449
<i>Maybe it's beyond saving.</i>

159
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:36,783
<i>But I have to try.</i>

160
00:18:37,621 --> 00:18:38,872
<i>Push myself.</i>

161
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:30,227
<i>These nights all roll together in a rush 
behind the mask.</i>

162
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:37,052
<i>Sometimes in the morning,</i>

163
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:41,056
<i>I have to force myself to remember...</i>

164
00:19:43,478 --> 00:19:45,063
<i>...everything that happened.</i>

165
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:01,286
Unbelievable breaking news 
this hour, everyone.

166
00:20:01,288 --> 00:20:05,161
Again, four-term incumbent
Gotham Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.

167
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:10,003
was found murdered last night inside his
home in the exclusive Crest Hill district.

168
00:20:10,005 --> 00:20:13,250
Exact details of the crime
still have not been released,

169
00:20:13,255 --> 00:20:16,133
but a citywide manhunt
is already underway

170
00:20:16,135 --> 00:20:19,407
as police and FBI search
for the brazen killer.

171
00:20:19,409 --> 00:20:21,453
And this certainly is not the first time

172
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:23,992
Gotham has been rocked 
by the murder of a political figure.

173
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:28,520
In fact, in an eerie coincidence,
it was 20 years ago this week

174
00:20:28,523 --> 00:20:32,399
that celebrated billionaire philanthropist
Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha

175
00:20:32,402 --> 00:20:35,227
were slain during 
Wayne's own mayoral campaign.

176
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:39,240
It was a shocking crime
that remains unsolved to this day.

177
00:20:39,242 --> 00:20:42,144
Don Mitchell, Jr.'s political career
was especially notable

178
00:20:42,145 --> 00:20:43,870
for his tough war on drugs

179
00:20:43,872 --> 00:20:47,152
when he and city police
launched a major sting operation,

180
00:20:47,164 --> 00:20:51,126
resulting in the arrest of notorious
mafia crime figure Salvatore Maroni

181
00:20:51,126 --> 00:20:55,507
with what, to this day, remains
the biggest drug bust in GCPD history.

182
00:20:55,509 --> 00:20:56,927
I assume you heard about this.

183
00:20:58,592 --> 00:20:59,843
Yeah.

184
00:21:07,062 --> 00:21:08,396
Oh, I see.

185
00:21:09,231 --> 00:21:11,149
All this blood is from his head?

186
00:21:11,691 --> 00:21:12,901
Dear God.

187
00:21:21,615 --> 00:21:23,658
There's a cipher too.

188
00:21:31,711 --> 00:21:34,005
Any of this mean anything to you?

189
00:21:37,175 --> 00:21:38,969
The killer left this for the Batman?

190
00:21:40,387 --> 00:21:42,137
I asked him to come, Pete.

191
00:21:42,139 --> 00:21:43,140
Apparently.

192
00:21:43,345 --> 00:21:45,221
You're becoming quite a celebrity.

193
00:21:47,224 --> 00:21:48,768
Why is he writing to you?

194
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:50,180
It's Mitchell, for chrissakes!

195
00:21:50,185 --> 00:21:51,396
I don't know yet.

196
00:21:51,398 --> 00:21:52,941
I got the press downstairs.

197
00:21:54,818 --> 00:21:56,236
Have a shower.

198
00:21:57,646 --> 00:22:00,360
Our accounting friends at Wayne Enterprises
are coming for breakfast.

199
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:02,141
Here? Why?

200
00:22:02,143 --> 00:22:03,780
Because I couldn't get you to go there.

201
00:22:03,782 --> 00:22:04,866
I haven't got time for this.

202
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:06,533
It's getting serious, Bruce.

203
00:22:06,535 --> 00:22:09,618
If this continues, it won't be long
before you've nothing left.

204
00:22:09,621 --> 00:22:11,207
I don't care about that.

205
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:12,998
Any of that.

206
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,668
You don't care about your family's legacy?

207
00:22:16,962 --> 00:22:19,727
What I'm doing is my family's legacy.

208
00:22:20,257 --> 00:22:22,298
If I can't change things here,

209
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:24,970
if I can't have an effect,

210
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,766
then I don't care what happens to me.

211
00:22:27,768 --> 00:22:28,915
That's what I'm afraid of.

212
00:22:28,921 --> 00:22:30,548
Alfred, stop.

213
00:22:31,957 --> 00:22:33,417
You're not my father.

214
00:22:36,106 --> 00:22:37,524
I'm well aware.

215
00:23:11,978 --> 00:23:14,231
We really gotta go, man.

216
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:41,463
Some fresh berries there.

217
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:49,596
What are you doing?

218
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:53,683
Just reminiscing about
my days in the Circus.

219
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:58,026
This is actually quite elusive.

220
00:24:00,983 --> 00:24:02,651
Where'd you get those O's?

221
00:24:04,111 --> 00:24:07,198
"He lies still" is only a partial key.

222
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,613
It only gives us H, E, L, I, S, and T.

223
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:13,869
So, I'm looking for any double symbols
to start, trying letters,

224
00:24:13,871 --> 00:24:15,247
see where it leads.

225
00:24:17,127 --> 00:24:18,176
That's interesting.

226
00:24:19,251 --> 00:24:20,864
Mr. Pennyworth?

227
00:24:20,881 --> 00:24:21,882
Yes, Dory?

228
00:24:22,045 --> 00:24:23,757
The accountants are here.

229
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:25,594
See them in, please, Dory.

230
00:24:28,302 --> 00:24:30,473
What if it's not a partial key?

231
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,345
What do you mean?

232
00:24:32,347 --> 00:24:34,184
What if this is the whole key?

233
00:24:35,228 --> 00:24:37,773
Ignore the symbols
we don't have letters for.

234
00:24:37,775 --> 00:24:39,824
Use only the letters from "He lies still" 
and leave the rest-

235
00:24:39,826 --> 00:24:41,231
Blank. Yeah, I understand.

236
00:24:41,234 --> 00:24:44,910
But that would leave most of the cipher
unsolved. I don't see how that's gonna...

237
00:24:47,821 --> 00:24:48,822
Oh.

238
00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:04,087
Damn.

239
00:25:04,546 --> 00:25:06,798
Yeah, he's got a car.

240
00:25:07,591 --> 00:25:10,090
Guess it's good to be the mayor.

241
00:25:10,097 --> 00:25:11,765
Where to even start?

242
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,879
You sure this isn't a leap?
"Drive" could mean anything.

243
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:15,918
You don't trust me?

244
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:18,473
You mean like you trust me?

245
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,358
It's been two years now,
and I don't even know who you are, man.

246
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:24,316
There.

247
00:25:47,592 --> 00:25:48,885
What are we looking for?

248
00:25:49,466 --> 00:25:51,136
A USB port.

249
00:25:51,138 --> 00:25:52,264
USB?

250
00:25:59,354 --> 00:26:00,522
What?

251
00:26:05,902 --> 00:26:08,155
"Thumb" drive.

252
00:26:08,861 --> 00:26:10,488
Jesus.

253
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,242
It's encrypted.

254
00:26:18,871 --> 00:26:20,164
Try this.

255
00:26:27,379 --> 00:26:29,756
Oh, this guy's hilarious.

256
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:41,185
Oh, well, well, well.

257
00:26:41,643 --> 00:26:43,895
So much for family values.

258
00:26:44,104 --> 00:26:45,272
Who is she?

259
00:26:45,274 --> 00:26:46,859
No idea.

260
00:26:47,524 --> 00:26:51,029
But that's the Penguin,
Carmine Falcone's right hand.

261
00:26:51,031 --> 00:26:52,532
I know who he is.

262
00:26:52,991 --> 00:26:53,992
What was that?

263
00:26:55,073 --> 00:26:55,992
Shit.

264
00:26:55,994 --> 00:26:58,682
Shit, shit! The drive.

265
00:26:59,244 --> 00:27:01,731
It sent out the photos from my account.

266
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:04,456
Gotham Post, Gazette, GC-1, all of them.

267
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:06,544
Jesus.

268
00:27:06,546 --> 00:27:08,950
I'm gonna catch hell for this.
Pete's gonna bust a gasket.

269
00:27:08,952 --> 00:27:10,412
"He lies still."

270
00:27:10,675 --> 00:27:11,718
About her?

271
00:27:12,674 --> 00:27:14,012
Maybe.

272
00:27:14,494 --> 00:27:16,551
That's the Iceberg Lounge.

273
00:27:16,553 --> 00:27:19,966
It's under the Shoreline Lofts
where Falcone was holed up.

274
00:27:19,973 --> 00:27:22,100
Never get in there without a warrant.

275
00:27:24,478 --> 00:27:25,562
Yeah.

276
00:27:38,742 --> 00:27:39,951
Know who I am?

277
00:27:41,373 --> 00:27:43,625
Yeah. I got an idea.

278
00:27:43,914 --> 00:27:45,332
I want to see the Penguin.

279
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:48,335
I don't know
what you're talking about, pal.

280
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:54,840
What's the problem?

281
00:27:54,842 --> 00:27:56,427
Says he wants to see the Penguin.

282
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:58,598
Penguin? There's no Penguin here.

283
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,345
That's what I tried to tell him.

284
00:28:00,347 --> 00:28:02,641
Get out of here, freak. You hear me?

285
00:28:02,643 --> 00:28:04,520
Or that little suit's
gonna get all full of blood.

286
00:28:05,894 --> 00:28:06,979
Mine or yours?

287
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:17,741
- Get him!
- I saw that whole thing.

288
00:28:17,743 --> 00:28:20,370
- He's over there!
- What is your problem?

289
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:05,207
Hey! Put the bat down,
or I'll blow your head off!

290
00:29:15,801 --> 00:29:17,342
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

291
00:29:17,344 --> 00:29:19,450
Take it easy, sweetheart.

292
00:29:19,468 --> 00:29:21,262
You looking for me?

293
00:29:22,057 --> 00:29:23,975
I see you met the twins.

294
00:29:24,935 --> 00:29:28,230
Boy, you're everything they say, ain't ya?

295
00:29:29,106 --> 00:29:30,607
I guess we both are.

296
00:29:32,648 --> 00:29:34,523
How you doing?

297
00:29:34,525 --> 00:29:35,944
I'm Oz.

298
00:29:41,532 --> 00:29:42,783
Who is she?

299
00:29:45,956 --> 00:29:47,874
I really don't know, Chief.

300
00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:52,254
I might have been coming out at the
same time, but I wasn't rolling with them.

301
00:30:05,684 --> 00:30:06,685
It's okay, baby.

302
00:30:07,182 --> 00:30:10,977
Mr. Vengeance here, he don't bite.
Come on.

303
00:30:36,757 --> 00:30:37,966
Thank you, honey.

304
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:46,303
Here you go, champ.

305
00:30:46,305 --> 00:30:50,018
I wanna know who she is,
and what she has to do with this murder.

306
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,813
- Whose murder?
- The mayor's.

307
00:30:52,144 --> 00:30:53,772
Is that the mayor?

308
00:30:53,774 --> 00:30:55,567
Oh, shit, it is. Look at that.

309
00:30:56,857 --> 00:30:58,150
Don't make me hurt you.

310
00:30:58,153 --> 00:31:02,315
You better watch it.
You know my reputation?

311
00:31:02,321 --> 00:31:05,282
Yeah, I do. Do you?

312
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,622
Look...

313
00:31:09,873 --> 00:31:12,667
I'm just the proprietor, okay?

314
00:31:13,502 --> 00:31:17,798
I mean, what people do here
ain't got nothing to do with me.

315
00:31:26,094 --> 00:31:27,679
Tell you one thing.

316
00:31:29,893 --> 00:31:33,480
Whoever she is, she's one hot chick.

317
00:31:33,894 --> 00:31:36,397
Why don't you ask Mitchell's wife?
Maybe she knows.

318
00:31:39,736 --> 00:31:41,571
What? Too soon?

319
00:31:51,415 --> 00:31:53,792
You let me know
if there's anything else I can do.

320
00:32:03,006 --> 00:32:04,007
Taxi!

321
00:32:06,596 --> 00:32:07,597
Taxi!

322
00:32:26,366 --> 00:32:27,659
Hey, it's me.

323
00:32:28,866 --> 00:32:30,201
Baby, what's wrong?

324
00:32:30,784 --> 00:32:32,786
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down, slow down. I can't...

325
00:32:35,247 --> 00:32:36,665
On the news?

326
00:32:37,374 --> 00:32:40,879
Okay. No. No, stay there.
Wait for me, okay?

327
00:32:40,881 --> 00:32:42,591
Wait for me, I'm on my way home.

328
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:47,387
Listen, baby, we're gonna get
the hell out of here, okay? I promise.

329
00:32:48,051 --> 00:32:50,679
If we have to leave earlier,
we'll leave tonight.

330
00:32:51,641 --> 00:32:52,809
Uh...

331
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,354
God damn it.

332
00:33:16,333 --> 00:33:20,367
...photos of murdered mayor, Don Mitchell, 
Jr. with a younger mystery woman.

333
00:33:20,378 --> 00:33:23,215
In a shocking development, 
the police believe the photos themselves...

334
00:33:56,537 --> 00:33:59,634
Now they urge her to contact the GCPD...

335
00:36:14,094 --> 00:36:15,524
You're pretty good at that.

336
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,171
Hey! Give me that.

337
00:36:52,799 --> 00:36:55,343
"Kosolov, Annika".

338
00:36:56,633 --> 00:36:59,012
He hurt her? That's why you killed him?

339
00:36:59,014 --> 00:37:01,767
What? Oh, please. Just give me the goddamn-

340
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,555
Listen, honey,
you got the wrong idea, okay?

341
00:37:42,557 --> 00:37:45,181
I didn't kill anybody. 
I'm here for my friend.

342
00:37:45,183 --> 00:37:48,394
She's trying to get the hell out of here,
and this son of a bitch stole her passport.

343
00:37:48,396 --> 00:37:49,728
What does she know?

344
00:37:49,728 --> 00:37:52,065
Whatever it is, it's got her so spooked
she won't even tell me.

345
00:37:52,067 --> 00:37:53,652
She did seem upset.

346
00:37:55,651 --> 00:37:57,153
Back at your place.

347
00:37:58,779 --> 00:38:00,438
Let's go talk to her.

348
00:38:26,515 --> 00:38:27,728
Anni!

349
00:38:28,934 --> 00:38:30,019
Baby!

350
00:38:31,645 --> 00:38:32,730
Anni!

351
00:38:36,862 --> 00:38:38,113
Anni!

352
00:38:40,479 --> 00:38:44,244
It's gonna be cool this evening.
It's gonna be down into the 40s.

353
00:38:44,616 --> 00:38:46,286
More breaking news this hour

354
00:38:46,288 --> 00:38:51,603
as the city is rocked by a second
high-profile murder in as many nights.

355
00:38:51,605 --> 00:38:53,866
And this time, the killer has come forward 
to claim credit online...

356
00:38:53,876 --> 00:38:56,712
Jesus, what are they gonna do to her?
She's just a kid.

357
00:38:58,834 --> 00:39:00,586
Shit, they took my phone.

358
00:39:00,591 --> 00:39:03,717
His victim, longtime head of the
Gotham City PD, Commissioner Pete Savage,

359
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:07,423
was found dead earlier tonight inside
the Police Athletic League facilities

360
00:39:07,424 --> 00:39:09,181
in the Tricorner area.

361
00:39:09,191 --> 00:39:12,517
The killer posted the following message
on social media,

362
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:15,399
and we have to warn you,
the video is very disturbing.

363
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,853
Hello, people of Gotham.

364
00:39:23,325 --> 00:39:25,285
This is the Riddler speaking.

365
00:39:26,662 --> 00:39:28,493
<i>On Halloween night,</i>

366
00:39:28,497 --> 00:39:32,813
I killed your mayor because he was not
who he pretended to be.

367
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:35,334
But I am not done.

368
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:40,759
Here is another...

369
00:39:45,263 --> 00:39:48,058
...who will soon be losing face.

370
00:39:49,223 --> 00:39:53,686
I will kill again, and again, and again,

371
00:39:53,688 --> 00:40:00,534
until our day of judgment when
the truth about our city will finally...

372
00:40:01,276 --> 00:40:03,079
...be unmasked.

373
00:40:04,947 --> 00:40:06,699
Goodbye!

374
00:40:10,869 --> 00:40:14,793
Commissioner Savage served a distinguished 
30-year career on the GCPD...

375
00:40:14,805 --> 00:40:17,018
Holy shit, I seen that guy too.

376
00:40:18,505 --> 00:40:19,587
At the club.

377
00:40:21,129 --> 00:40:22,547
The Iceberg Lounge?

378
00:40:23,006 --> 00:40:24,466
44 Below.

379
00:40:26,677 --> 00:40:27,735
What is that?

380
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:32,519
The club within the club.

381
00:40:33,976 --> 00:40:35,774
The real club.

382
00:40:37,816 --> 00:40:39,568
It's a mob hangout.

383
00:40:39,815 --> 00:40:41,234
Is that where you work?

384
00:40:43,485 --> 00:40:44,319
Selina?

385
00:40:49,908 --> 00:40:51,785
No, I just work the bar upstairs.

386
00:40:55,417 --> 00:40:57,041
But I see 'em come in.

387
00:40:57,043 --> 00:40:58,415
Who?

388
00:40:58,417 --> 00:41:00,836
A lot of guys that shouldn't be there,
I can tell you that.

389
00:41:02,713 --> 00:41:05,382
Your basic upstanding citizen types.

390
00:41:07,676 --> 00:41:09,345
You're gonna help me on this.

391
00:41:09,761 --> 00:41:11,263
For your friend.

392
00:41:21,899 --> 00:41:23,233
You got a lot of cats.

393
00:41:24,693 --> 00:41:26,612
I have a thing about strays.

394
00:41:30,782 --> 00:41:32,116
You're not safe here.

395
00:41:33,293 --> 00:41:34,621
I can take care of myself.

396
00:41:34,623 --> 00:41:37,499
Two public figures now dead
in just the last two nights,

397
00:41:37,501 --> 00:41:39,125
and only days before the election.

398
00:41:39,127 --> 00:41:42,462
Police and city officials
are left searching for a killer

399
00:41:42,464 --> 00:41:45,300
and hoping to find him 
before he kills again.

400
00:42:03,232 --> 00:42:06,402
He waited for him at the gym.

401
00:42:07,569 --> 00:42:11,868
Pete always liked to work out late 
at night, when no one else was around.

402
00:42:12,994 --> 00:42:14,494
There's a needle mark on his neck.

403
00:42:14,496 --> 00:42:16,456
Injected him with arsenic.

404
00:42:18,387 --> 00:42:19,722
Rat poison.

405
00:42:20,585 --> 00:42:22,311
Yeah.

406
00:42:22,337 --> 00:42:24,798
That seems to be his theme here.

407
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:26,669
Look at this thing.

408
00:42:34,763 --> 00:42:36,514
It's a maze.

409
00:42:39,187 --> 00:42:42,482
What kind of demented son of a bitch
does this to a person?

410
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:46,316
More symbols.

411
00:42:48,735 --> 00:42:50,488
It's another cipher.

412
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:53,243
He blasted these out
after his message went viral.

413
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:56,496
Bastard murders you and your reputation.

414
00:42:56,498 --> 00:42:59,871
That guy pushes drops. On the east end.

415
00:43:01,123 --> 00:43:05,088
I don't get it. Why would Pete
get involved in something like this?

416
00:43:05,919 --> 00:43:08,049
Looks like he got greedy.

417
00:43:08,051 --> 00:43:09,215
You kidding me?

418
00:43:09,217 --> 00:43:11,928
After everything we did
to take down the Maronis?

419
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:15,346
We busted their entire operation,
then he caves to some lowlife dealer?

420
00:43:15,348 --> 00:43:17,559
Maybe he's not who you thought.

421
00:43:19,102 --> 00:43:21,146
You make it sound like he had it coming.

422
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:24,730
He was a cop.

423
00:43:26,193 --> 00:43:27,486
Crossed a line.

424
00:43:58,497 --> 00:44:00,347
"I'm mad about you.

425
00:44:00,349 --> 00:44:04,019
"Want to know my name?
Just look inside and see."

426
00:44:11,279 --> 00:44:14,246
"Follow the maze until you find the rat.

427
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:18,201
"Bring him into the light,
and you'll find where I'm at."

428
00:44:18,203 --> 00:44:19,913
The hell is that?

429
00:44:20,664 --> 00:44:23,834
"Bring him into the light"?
"Find the rat"?

430
00:44:24,873 --> 00:44:26,374
I don't know.

431
00:44:27,125 --> 00:44:28,518
Lieutenant.

432
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:29,995
They're coming back.

433
00:44:30,003 --> 00:44:31,254
We got to get out of here.

434
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:36,509
Come on.

435
00:44:41,557 --> 00:44:42,600
Ow!

436
00:44:44,229 --> 00:44:45,645
I don't know about these things.

437
00:44:45,647 --> 00:44:49,109
I need to see in there, 
this hunting ground.

438
00:44:53,068 --> 00:44:55,654
Hey, why am I starting 
to feel like a fish on a hook?

439
00:44:57,576 --> 00:44:59,035
I'm just looking for Annika.

440
00:45:03,331 --> 00:45:04,958
Boy, you're a real sweetheart.

441
00:45:06,084 --> 00:45:08,712
You really don't care what happens to me
in there tonight, do you?

442
00:45:18,263 --> 00:45:19,473
Look at me.

443
00:45:29,107 --> 00:45:31,276
Looks good. Here.

444
00:46:14,316 --> 00:46:16,318
I got you. Can you hear me?

445
00:46:17,319 --> 00:46:18,320
Yeah.

446
00:46:27,082 --> 00:46:28,083
Hey, where you goin'?

447
00:46:28,708 --> 00:46:29,835
Hospitality.

448
00:46:30,582 --> 00:46:33,419
That's one of the guys
I got into it with the other night.

449
00:46:35,215 --> 00:46:36,716
Looks like I broke his nose.

450
00:46:43,178 --> 00:46:46,931
"Kenzie, William". He's an off-duty cop.

451
00:46:48,934 --> 00:46:50,895
Are you sure no one can see
these things in my eyes?

452
00:46:50,897 --> 00:46:52,941
Don't worry. I'm watching you.

453
00:47:09,413 --> 00:47:12,698
Don't look away.
I need time to make IDs.

454
00:47:12,711 --> 00:47:13,963
Great.

455
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,470
These guys have a little problem
with eye contact, don't they?

456
00:47:23,472 --> 00:47:25,135
Feels good, doesn't it?

457
00:47:25,137 --> 00:47:27,347
Yeah, baby. Feels real good.

458
00:47:33,398 --> 00:47:35,106
Jesus, I hate dropheads.

459
00:47:35,108 --> 00:47:36,073
Really?

460
00:47:36,088 --> 00:47:38,565
'Cause when I first saw you, it looked
like you were dealing for Penguin.

461
00:47:38,570 --> 00:47:41,190
You don't know what you're talking about. 
Can we not...

462
00:47:41,195 --> 00:47:42,947
Can we not do this right now?

463
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:46,743
Wait. Who was that?

464
00:47:46,745 --> 00:47:49,010
- Oh, I saw him.
- Look back.

465
00:47:49,028 --> 00:47:50,994
If I look back, 
it's gonna be a whole can of worms.

466
00:47:50,996 --> 00:47:52,401
I need to see his face.

467
00:47:54,291 --> 00:47:55,557
Jesus.

468
00:48:03,512 --> 00:48:04,841
That's the DA.

469
00:48:04,843 --> 00:48:05,862
Gil Colson.

470
00:48:05,886 --> 00:48:07,554
And he's coming over. You happy?

471
00:48:07,554 --> 00:48:08,763
Talk to him.

472
00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:14,226
- Hey. How you doing?
- Hi.

473
00:48:14,228 --> 00:48:15,229
I'm Gil.

474
00:48:16,313 --> 00:48:18,198
Hey, aren't you the DA?

475
00:48:18,213 --> 00:48:19,135
Yeah.

476
00:48:19,149 --> 00:48:21,358
Wow. I've seen you on TV.

477
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:23,279
Is that right?

478
00:48:23,281 --> 00:48:25,492
I haven't seen you around here before.

479
00:48:26,108 --> 00:48:31,173
It's a hell of a time to be the new girl,
'cause people are all a little on edge.

480
00:48:31,203 --> 00:48:34,124
- Oh, honey, I live on the edge.
- Is that right?

481
00:48:34,126 --> 00:48:35,335
I like that.

482
00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:36,835
Do you want to come over?

483
00:48:36,837 --> 00:48:37,963
Sure.

484
00:48:40,966 --> 00:48:42,382
- This is Travis.
- Hey.

485
00:48:42,384 --> 00:48:43,802
You wanna take a seat over there?

486
00:48:44,091 --> 00:48:45,968
- Richie, Glen.
- Hey.

487
00:48:47,161 --> 00:48:48,885
That's half the DA's office.

488
00:48:48,903 --> 00:48:50,345
You know Carla here, huh?

489
00:48:50,347 --> 00:48:51,120
Hi.

490
00:48:51,139 --> 00:48:53,435
That's Cheri. Don't mind her,
she's just taking a break.

491
00:48:53,437 --> 00:48:55,313
Drowning our sorrows.

492
00:48:55,517 --> 00:48:56,810
You want a drop?

493
00:48:56,812 --> 00:48:58,856
Uh, no, I'm good. But you enjoy.

494
00:49:00,983 --> 00:49:02,777
Hope you don't mind.

495
00:49:02,779 --> 00:49:05,280
I got a lot on my shoulders
with that psycho running around.

496
00:49:05,282 --> 00:49:06,322
He's wasted.

497
00:49:06,324 --> 00:49:07,367
No shit.

498
00:49:09,035 --> 00:49:10,479
I like this girl.

499
00:49:10,495 --> 00:49:12,080
Oh, hey, I like you too!

500
00:49:15,617 --> 00:49:18,954
I mean, this Riddler, he's going after
the most powerful people in the city.

501
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:20,211
He knows so much.

502
00:49:20,213 --> 00:49:21,502
He doesn't know shit, man.

503
00:49:21,503 --> 00:49:23,923
What are you talking about?
Yeah, he does! What about that rat...

504
00:49:23,925 --> 00:49:25,377
- Hey, hey, Gil, come on.
- Hey.

505
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:26,925
- Think maybe you had a little too much.
- The rat.

506
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:28,886
- Slow down.
- Ask him about the rat.

507
00:49:30,891 --> 00:49:32,726
Hey, what's this about a rat?

508
00:49:42,923 --> 00:49:49,196
I mean... there was a rat. 
We had an informant.

509
00:49:49,198 --> 00:49:51,785
We had big-time information
on Salvatore Maroni.

510
00:49:51,787 --> 00:49:53,578
That's how we got him out 
of the drops business.

511
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:55,147
He's talking about the Maroni case.

512
00:49:55,162 --> 00:49:58,366
But if this guy knows, it's gonna come out.

513
00:49:59,041 --> 00:50:01,503
And when it does,
this whole city's gonna come apart.

514
00:50:01,505 --> 00:50:03,423
Okay, I don't wanna hear this.

515
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:06,379
This is the kind of pillow talk
that got that Russian girl disappeared.

516
00:50:06,381 --> 00:50:07,632
What do you know about that?

517
00:50:08,905 --> 00:50:11,259
- Does anybody want a drink?
- I want a drink.

518
00:50:11,261 --> 00:50:12,593
Keep him talking.

519
00:50:15,811 --> 00:50:18,103
- Wait, where are you going?
- She knows Annika.

520
00:50:18,105 --> 00:50:19,586
No, stay on the DA.

521
00:50:19,606 --> 00:50:21,525
I told you I'm looking for my friend.

522
00:50:23,649 --> 00:50:25,860
- Where's Annika?
- Out of my face. I don't know you.

523
00:50:25,862 --> 00:50:27,759
Yeah, but you know her. Who took her? 
What have you heard? Is she okay?

524
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,862
Jesus Christ, keep your voice down.
What, you got a death wish?

525
00:50:30,864 --> 00:50:33,448
Hey, what's the problem, ladies?

526
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:36,227
There's no problem. It's just girl talk.

527
00:50:36,245 --> 00:50:38,079
Let's keep it festive down here, all right?

528
00:50:38,083 --> 00:50:39,167
Sure thing, Oz.

529
00:50:44,002 --> 00:50:45,045
Hey.

530
00:50:45,549 --> 00:50:46,633
Hey.

531
00:50:47,801 --> 00:50:50,971
Been a long time 
since I seen you down here.

532
00:50:52,264 --> 00:50:53,547
How you been?

533
00:50:55,639 --> 00:50:57,349
Yeah, I've been okay.

534
00:50:58,854 --> 00:51:00,230
I was just...

535
00:51:02,274 --> 00:51:04,109
I was just headed back upstairs.

536
00:51:04,731 --> 00:51:05,732
Well...

537
00:51:06,608 --> 00:51:08,430
don't be a stranger.

538
00:51:22,288 --> 00:51:23,665
You know Carmine Falcone.

539
00:51:23,666 --> 00:51:24,958
I told you it's a mob spot.

540
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,668
You didn't tell me
you had a relationship with him.

541
00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:28,715
I don't have a relationship with him, okay?

542
00:51:28,717 --> 00:51:30,633
- Well, that's not what it looked like.
- Forget it.

543
00:51:30,635 --> 00:51:31,801
Wait, what are you doing?

544
00:51:31,803 --> 00:51:34,222
- Listen, I can't do this anymore.
- No! No!

545
00:51:38,771 --> 00:51:39,772
Taxi!

546
00:51:43,645 --> 00:51:44,646
Hey!

547
00:51:46,485 --> 00:51:48,737
- I lost you in there.
- Yeah, I gotta go.

548
00:51:49,613 --> 00:51:51,031
Oh, you need a ride?

549
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:53,033
That's me right there.

550
00:51:59,122 --> 00:52:00,288
Taxi!

551
00:52:00,290 --> 00:52:01,416
I'm good.

552
00:52:02,998 --> 00:52:04,416
I hope, uh...

553
00:52:09,046 --> 00:52:10,464
I'll see you around.

554
00:53:37,176 --> 00:53:40,972
Just hold still.

555
00:54:39,366 --> 00:54:42,661
What do you know about a confidential 
informant in the Maroni case?

556
00:54:45,747 --> 00:54:47,457
Yeah, sure, there was.

557
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:49,915
That's the rat we're looking for.

558
00:54:50,832 --> 00:54:52,709
Somehow Riddler knows who he is.

559
00:54:53,293 --> 00:54:56,464
If we find the rat,
maybe it'll lead us to him.

560
00:54:56,466 --> 00:54:58,006
Where are you getting this?

561
00:54:58,009 --> 00:55:00,887
I have a source
who spoke to the DA tonight.

562
00:55:01,635 --> 00:55:03,095
Gil's very nervous.

563
00:55:04,099 --> 00:55:06,724
I think the killer's targeting
people close to that case.

564
00:55:06,726 --> 00:55:08,598
I worked that case.

565
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:10,555
Riddler's not after you.

566
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:11,893
How do you know?

567
00:55:11,895 --> 00:55:13,314
You're not corrupt.

568
00:55:14,484 --> 00:55:16,027
Colson's dirty?

569
00:55:21,908 --> 00:55:23,410
Maybe I, uh...

570
00:55:23,991 --> 00:55:27,490
I go after him.
Lean on him to give up the rat.

571
00:55:27,497 --> 00:55:30,792
It's too dangerous.
They made a secret deal with this guy.

572
00:55:31,456 --> 00:55:36,631
Who knows how many people it touches.
Politicians. Police. The courts.

573
00:55:37,924 --> 00:55:39,634
It could tear the whole city apart.

574
00:55:40,051 --> 00:55:42,095
Jesus, this is a powder keg.

575
00:55:43,594 --> 00:55:45,346
And Riddler's the match.

576
00:55:46,349 --> 00:55:48,967
- You know Carmine Falcone.
- I told you it's a mob spot.

577
00:55:48,977 --> 00:55:50,477
You didn't tell me you had
a relationship with him.

578
00:55:50,479 --> 00:55:52,045
I don't have a relationship...

579
00:55:53,014 --> 00:55:54,599
You didn't tell me you had
a relationship with him.

580
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:56,356
I don't have a relationship with him. Okay?

581
00:55:57,486 --> 00:56:00,153
- You know Carmine Falcone.
- I told you it's a mob spot.

582
00:56:00,155 --> 00:56:01,863
You didn't tell me
you had a relationship with him.

583
00:56:01,865 --> 00:56:03,685
I don't have a relationship with him. Okay?

584
00:56:03,697 --> 00:56:04,948
Pretty.

585
00:56:07,037 --> 00:56:08,413
She a new friend of yours?

586
00:56:12,915 --> 00:56:14,125
I'm not so sure.

587
00:56:15,045 --> 00:56:16,546
Looks like you upset her.

588
00:56:17,589 --> 00:56:19,961
Shall I take this as a good sign?

589
00:56:19,963 --> 00:56:21,693
- What?
- Your attire.

590
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,217
Is Bruce Wayne making
an actual appearance?

591
00:56:24,218 --> 00:56:26,303
There's a public memorial 
for Mayor Mitchell.

592
00:56:26,306 --> 00:56:28,975
Serial killers like to follow reactions 
to their crimes.

593
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:31,684
Riddler might not be able to resist.

594
00:56:31,686 --> 00:56:33,146
Oh, that reminds me.

595
00:56:34,314 --> 00:56:38,817
I've taken the liberty of doing
a little work on this latest cipher.

596
00:56:38,819 --> 00:56:40,735
The one from the rat maze.

597
00:56:40,737 --> 00:56:46,021
I'm afraid his Spanish is not perfect,
but I'm fairly certain this translates to,

598
00:56:46,031 --> 00:56:49,284
"You are El Rata Alada."

599
00:56:49,826 --> 00:56:51,496
Rata Alada?

600
00:56:51,498 --> 00:56:52,744
"Rat with wings"?

601
00:56:52,746 --> 00:56:55,365
It's slang for "pigeon".
Does that mean anything to you?

602
00:56:55,377 --> 00:56:56,628
Yeah.

603
00:56:58,088 --> 00:56:59,318
A stool pigeon.

604
00:56:59,336 --> 00:57:00,943
Where are your cufflinks?

605
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:02,130
I couldn't find them.

606
00:57:03,546 --> 00:57:05,507
Well, you can't go out like that.

607
00:57:05,509 --> 00:57:07,303
Alfred, I don't want your cufflinks.

608
00:57:11,601 --> 00:57:14,396
You have to keep up appearances.
You're still a Wayne.

609
00:57:16,061 --> 00:57:18,271
And what about you? Are you a Wayne?

610
00:57:19,317 --> 00:57:21,111
Your father gave them to me.

611
00:57:26,867 --> 00:57:29,995
No more lies! No more lies!

612
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:51,141
Mr. Wayne. All right. All right,
you're going straight down there.

613
00:58:03,690 --> 00:58:05,442
Is that Bruce Wayne?

614
00:58:05,444 --> 00:58:08,072
Mr. Wayne! Mr. Wayne! Mr. Wayne!

615
00:58:17,122 --> 00:58:18,386
Hold it.

616
00:58:19,586 --> 00:58:20,995
You good, fellas?

617
00:58:21,376 --> 00:58:22,377
Good.

618
00:58:24,505 --> 00:58:25,761
We're good, Mr. Falcone.

619
00:58:43,443 --> 00:58:44,444
Sir?

620
00:59:04,211 --> 00:59:05,170
Hey!

621
00:59:05,170 --> 00:59:07,172
Give us a wide berth here, 
would you, slick?

622
00:59:07,923 --> 00:59:10,427
Hey, watch it, fellas.

623
00:59:10,429 --> 00:59:12,722
You got the prince of the city there.

624
00:59:15,514 --> 00:59:17,475
Some event, huh?

625
00:59:17,477 --> 00:59:20,503
Brought out the one guy in the city
more reclusive than me.

626
00:59:20,522 --> 00:59:22,974
Thought you'd never leave the Shoreline.

627
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:24,690
Aren't you afraid 
someone'll take a shot at you?

628
00:59:24,690 --> 00:59:26,692
Why? 'Cause your father ain't around?

629
00:59:27,654 --> 00:59:29,072
Oz, you know Bruce Wayne?

630
00:59:29,486 --> 00:59:31,152
Wow. Is that right?

631
00:59:31,154 --> 00:59:33,198
His father saved my life.

632
00:59:33,824 --> 00:59:35,675
I got shot in the chest.

633
00:59:36,577 --> 00:59:37,644
Right here.

634
00:59:38,537 --> 00:59:42,041
I couldn't go to no hospital,
so we showed up on his doorstep.

635
00:59:42,332 --> 00:59:45,543
Operated right on the dining room table.

636
00:59:45,544 --> 00:59:51,011
Kid here, he saw the whole thing,
up on the stairs looking down.

637
00:59:52,342 --> 00:59:54,344
I remember your face.

638
00:59:56,176 --> 00:59:58,767
You don't think that meant something,
he did that?

639
00:59:58,769 --> 01:00:00,896
It meant he took the Hippocratic oath.

640
01:00:02,144 --> 01:00:03,729
"Hippocratic oath".

641
01:00:06,273 --> 01:00:07,483
That's good.

642
01:00:08,111 --> 01:00:09,279
Excuse me.

643
01:00:12,696 --> 01:00:13,719
Yes.

644
01:00:27,961 --> 01:00:30,634
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you all 
for coming to today's memorial

645
01:00:30,631 --> 01:00:33,160
for our beloved mayor, Don Mitchell, Jr.

646
01:00:33,178 --> 01:00:35,053
Our program will begin shortly.

647
01:00:35,055 --> 01:00:38,056
As a reminder, the family asked that
those wishing to honor the mayor's memory

648
01:00:38,058 --> 01:00:41,765
consider a donation to the cause 
most dear to his heart,

649
01:00:41,767 --> 01:00:45,431
the Gotham Renewal Fund,
our city's safety net.

650
01:00:45,433 --> 01:00:48,148
What good's a safety net
doesn't catch anybody?

651
01:00:49,107 --> 01:00:53,071
Didn't help my daughter
when she needed it, I can tell you that.

652
01:00:53,073 --> 01:00:56,284
The guy was just another rich scum-sucker.

653
01:00:57,199 --> 01:00:59,076
He got what he deserved.

654
01:01:00,994 --> 01:01:02,088
Know what I mean?

655
01:01:03,286 --> 01:01:05,413
Hey, don't I know you?

656
01:01:05,415 --> 01:01:06,675
Bruce Wayne.

657
01:01:07,334 --> 01:01:09,709
Why haven't you called me back?

658
01:01:09,711 --> 01:01:10,752
I'm sorry?

659
01:01:10,754 --> 01:01:13,341
I'm Bella Reál. I'm running for mayor.

660
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:17,305
I wouldn't be bothering you here, but your
people keep telling me you're unavailable.

661
01:01:17,307 --> 01:01:18,641
Will you walk with me?

662
01:01:23,809 --> 01:01:24,941
Mr. Wayne.

663
01:01:25,227 --> 01:01:26,440
Mr. Wayne.

664
01:01:27,145 --> 01:01:30,159
You know, you really could be
doing more for this city.

665
01:01:30,816 --> 01:01:32,819
Your family has a history of philanthropy,

666
01:01:32,821 --> 01:01:35,214
but as far as I can tell,
you're not doing anything.

667
01:01:35,237 --> 01:01:37,698
If I'm elected, I want to change that.

668
01:01:38,323 --> 01:01:39,616
Thank you.

669
01:01:40,526 --> 01:01:41,538
My God.

670
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:44,761
I'm gonna go pay my respects.

671
01:01:44,762 --> 01:01:47,416
Will you wait for me?
I want to continue this.

672
01:01:51,798 --> 01:01:52,674
Excuse me.

673
01:01:54,718 --> 01:01:56,595
I'm so sorry for your loss.

674
01:01:58,792 --> 01:01:59,710
Thank you.

675
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:01,472
Excuse me, Chief. Can I talk to you?

676
01:02:02,887 --> 01:02:05,792
- Gil Colson is missing.
- What?

677
01:02:06,059 --> 01:02:08,605
He hasn't been heard from since last night.

678
01:02:08,607 --> 01:02:09,731
Christ, not again.

679
01:02:09,733 --> 01:02:11,818
Hey. Mr. Wayne.

680
01:02:14,112 --> 01:02:16,156
You got people looking for him, Jim?

681
01:02:16,653 --> 01:02:19,199
Sent a couple guys to his house. Nothing.

682
01:02:19,201 --> 01:02:21,411
- What'd his wife say?
- She hadn't heard from him.

683
01:03:16,174 --> 01:03:17,266
Get out of the car!

684
01:03:17,631 --> 01:03:19,841
Get out of the car and show your hands!

685
01:03:21,471 --> 01:03:22,681
Get out!

686
01:03:33,063 --> 01:03:34,566
Get 'em up!

687
01:03:34,568 --> 01:03:36,319
Get out! Show 'em!

688
01:03:40,773 --> 01:03:42,358
Christ, it's Colson.

689
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:44,157
There's a bomb around his neck!

690
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:00,841
Let's clear this place out now!

691
01:04:00,844 --> 01:04:02,471
We've got to get this place cleared out!

692
01:04:36,713 --> 01:04:39,466
Hey, guys, guys. Here we go.

693
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:43,884
We don't know if he's in on it.

694
01:04:46,970 --> 01:04:48,372
What's he looking at?

695
01:05:07,074 --> 01:05:08,408
Holy shit.

696
01:05:09,491 --> 01:05:11,159
Are you kidding me?

697
01:05:11,161 --> 01:05:13,060
What the hell is he doing?

698
01:05:13,061 --> 01:05:14,029
Gordon!

699
01:05:14,748 --> 01:05:17,208
Your guy's gonna get himself 
killed in there.

700
01:05:32,933 --> 01:05:34,427
Please.

701
01:05:34,438 --> 01:05:37,190
He made me do it. I'm so sorry.

702
01:05:37,646 --> 01:05:41,005
He told me if I didn't do exactly
what he said, he'd kill me. I'm so sorry.

703
01:05:41,275 --> 01:05:43,005
Looks like a combination lock.

704
01:05:43,026 --> 01:05:44,485
Can't we just cut it off?

705
01:05:45,279 --> 01:05:46,947
Not if you want to keep your head.

706
01:06:23,609 --> 01:06:24,860
You came.

707
01:06:26,823 --> 01:06:28,448
Who are you?

708
01:06:28,450 --> 01:06:29,638
Me?

709
01:06:31,825 --> 01:06:33,410
I'm nobody.

710
01:06:34,870 --> 01:06:37,415
I'm just an instrument,

711
01:06:37,417 --> 01:06:41,974
here to unmask the truth
about this cesspool we call a city.

712
01:06:42,336 --> 01:06:44,591
- "Unmask"?
- Yes.

713
01:06:45,425 --> 01:06:48,261
Let's do it together, okay?

714
01:06:48,263 --> 01:06:53,755
I've been trying to reach you.
You're part of this too.

715
01:06:53,757 --> 01:06:55,505
How am I a part of this?

716
01:06:55,776 --> 01:06:57,545
You'll see.

717
01:06:57,559 --> 01:06:59,562
Hey, Chief. You better take a look at this.

718
01:06:59,564 --> 01:07:01,478
Say hello to my followers.

719
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:03,060
We're live.

720
01:07:03,068 --> 01:07:06,071
They're here to watch our little trial.

721
01:07:07,065 --> 01:07:12,073
At the moment,
the man across from you, Mr. Colson,

722
01:07:12,075 --> 01:07:13,118
is dead.

723
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:15,283
Jesus, can we get somebody out here?
This psycho's gonna kill me!

724
01:07:15,285 --> 01:07:16,244
But wait a minute...

725
01:07:16,248 --> 01:07:22,537
Shut up! You deserve to be dead
after what you did! You hear me?

726
01:07:22,546 --> 01:07:23,547
Okay.

727
01:07:32,305 --> 01:07:34,391
I'm giving you a chance.

728
01:07:36,014 --> 01:07:38,182
No one ever gave me a chance.

729
01:07:40,355 --> 01:07:41,398
Now,

730
01:07:42,392 --> 01:07:45,274
ever since I was a child,

731
01:07:45,277 --> 01:07:48,864
I've always loved little puzzles.

732
01:07:49,403 --> 01:07:55,368
For me, they are a retreat
from the horrors of our world.

733
01:07:55,370 --> 01:08:00,665
Maybe they can bring some comfort 
to you too, Mr. Colson.

734
01:08:00,667 --> 01:08:02,274
You want me to do puzzles?

735
01:08:02,916 --> 01:08:05,829
Three riddles in two minutes.

736
01:08:05,834 --> 01:08:09,921
You give me the answers,
and I'll give you the code for the lock.

737
01:08:09,923 --> 01:08:12,176
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.

738
01:08:12,176 --> 01:08:14,574
Okay, okay. So I just...

739
01:08:14,595 --> 01:08:15,680
You want me to-

740
01:08:16,221 --> 01:08:18,308
Riddle number one...

741
01:08:18,310 --> 01:08:21,938
"It can be cruel, poetic, or blind,

742
01:08:21,935 --> 01:08:26,775
"but when it's denied,
it's violence you may find."

743
01:08:26,777 --> 01:08:29,035
Wait, wait, wait! Can you repeat that?

744
01:08:29,026 --> 01:08:30,434
"Cruel"? "Poetic"?

745
01:08:30,447 --> 01:08:31,865
- "Justice".
- Huh?

746
01:08:31,862 --> 01:08:33,073
The answer's "justice".

747
01:08:33,075 --> 01:08:34,284
- Justice?
- Yes!

748
01:08:34,281 --> 01:08:36,034
- Oh, God.
- <i>Justice!</i>

749
01:08:36,036 --> 01:08:40,455
And you were supposed
to be an arm of justice in this city,

750
01:08:40,457 --> 01:08:42,916
along with the late mayor
and police commissioner,

751
01:08:42,918 --> 01:08:45,457
were you not, Mr. Colson?

752
01:08:45,459 --> 01:08:46,669
Of course, of course. Of course.

753
01:08:46,671 --> 01:08:49,049
Riddle number two.

754
01:08:49,051 --> 01:08:53,343
"If you are justice, please do not lie.

755
01:08:53,345 --> 01:08:57,516
"What is the price for your blind eye?"

756
01:08:57,513 --> 01:08:59,473
- "The price"?
- "Bribes".

757
01:08:59,476 --> 01:09:00,809
Oh, God. "Bribes"?

758
01:09:00,811 --> 01:09:03,137
He's asking you how much it cost
for you to turn your back.

759
01:09:04,228 --> 01:09:05,605
Fifty-eight seconds!

760
01:09:05,607 --> 01:09:06,940
- How much?
- Nothing!

761
01:09:06,942 --> 01:09:09,129
- How much?
- Ten grand. Ten Gs a month.

762
01:09:09,149 --> 01:09:11,606
I get a monthly payment
just not to prosecute certain cases.

763
01:09:11,613 --> 01:09:12,447
What cases?

764
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:13,942
He didn't ask me that! Come on!

765
01:09:13,946 --> 01:09:15,192
Ten grand.

766
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:18,161
- That's my answer. It's ten grand!
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

767
01:09:18,158 --> 01:09:20,867
Don't lose your head, Mr. Colson.

768
01:09:20,869 --> 01:09:24,865
Just one more to go
before your time runs out.

769
01:09:24,876 --> 01:09:27,290
Last riddle.

770
01:09:27,292 --> 01:09:31,795
"Since your justice is so select,

771
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:36,096
"please tell us which vermin
you're paid to protect."

772
01:09:36,098 --> 01:09:37,977
- "Which vermin"?
- The rat.

773
01:09:38,011 --> 01:09:40,974
The informant you all protect
from the Salvatore Maroni case.

774
01:09:40,976 --> 01:09:42,764
- How do you know about that?
- What's his name?

775
01:09:42,766 --> 01:09:44,123
Twenty seconds.

776
01:09:44,146 --> 01:09:45,678
- No.
- He's gonna kill you.

777
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:48,019
I'm a dead man either way.
You're talking to a dead man, okay?

778
01:09:48,021 --> 01:09:49,564
If I go out this way, it's just me.

779
01:09:49,568 --> 01:09:52,858
But if I give over that name,
I have family, people I love.

780
01:09:52,860 --> 01:09:54,320
- He'll kill them too.
- Who will?

781
01:09:54,322 --> 01:09:55,738
- People are watching.
- What people?

782
01:09:55,741 --> 01:09:57,949
It's so much bigger
than you could ever imagine.

783
01:09:57,951 --> 01:10:00,120
- It's the whole system!
- Five!

784
01:10:00,117 --> 01:10:01,161
Four!

785
01:10:01,163 --> 01:10:02,620
- Oh, God, have mercy on me...
- Three!

786
01:10:02,622 --> 01:10:04,499
Goodbye!

787
01:10:34,526 --> 01:10:36,154
Who do you think he is under there?

788
01:10:36,156 --> 01:10:38,075
- Take it easy.
- I want to see.

789
01:10:39,323 --> 01:10:40,717
What is that thing? Leather?

790
01:10:44,328 --> 01:10:45,914
What's he got on his eyes?

791
01:10:45,916 --> 01:10:47,375
Who cares? I want to see his face.

792
01:10:47,381 --> 01:10:48,750
What are we doing here?
Let's just take it off...

793
01:10:48,752 --> 01:10:49,920
Hey!

794
01:10:50,504 --> 01:10:53,632
Hey! Hey! Hey!

795
01:10:53,634 --> 01:10:55,248
Relax, God damn it!

796
01:10:55,255 --> 01:10:56,928
You're protecting this guy, Jim?

797
01:10:58,258 --> 01:11:01,076
He interfered in 
an active hostage situation.

798
01:11:01,094 --> 01:11:03,513
Colson's blood is on his hands.

799
01:11:03,517 --> 01:11:04,935
Maybe it's on yours.

800
01:11:06,147 --> 01:11:07,277
What'd you say?

801
01:11:07,305 --> 01:11:09,686
He would rather die than talk.

802
01:11:09,689 --> 01:11:11,303
What was he afraid of?

803
01:11:11,942 --> 01:11:13,026
You?

804
01:11:20,158 --> 01:11:21,576
You son of a bitch.

805
01:11:21,990 --> 01:11:24,724
You have any idea
what kind of trouble you're in?

806
01:11:25,202 --> 01:11:27,038
You could be an accessory to murder.

807
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:28,154
Why are we playing games-

808
01:11:30,168 --> 01:11:31,126
Get him! Come on!

809
01:11:31,128 --> 01:11:33,211
Back off! Back off!

810
01:11:33,213 --> 01:11:35,420
Great, now I got you
on assaulting an officer!

811
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:36,733
You got me on assaulting three.

812
01:11:36,734 --> 01:11:37,757
Hey!

813
01:11:37,759 --> 01:11:40,554
What's the matter with you?
This isn't the way to do this!

814
01:11:43,214 --> 01:11:44,757
You too now?

815
01:11:44,759 --> 01:11:47,459
Let me handle this, Chief.
Just give me a minute.

816
01:11:47,477 --> 01:11:50,054
You're gonna put yourself on the line
for this scumbag, Jim?

817
01:11:50,056 --> 01:11:52,396
Just give me a minute.
I'll get him to cooperate.

818
01:11:55,107 --> 01:11:56,609
Okay, give him the room.

819
01:12:12,249 --> 01:12:13,542
Two minutes.

820
01:12:25,345 --> 01:12:26,930
You listen to me.

821
01:12:28,473 --> 01:12:30,475
We gotta get you out of here.

822
01:12:32,223 --> 01:12:34,098
That would put a lot of heat on you.

823
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:35,939
Well, you punched me in the face.

824
01:12:38,195 --> 01:12:39,488
Take this key.

825
01:12:40,781 --> 01:12:44,159
Through that door. Hallway to the stairs
that go to the roof.

826
01:12:45,202 --> 01:12:46,912
Hey, what the hell is going on here?

827
01:12:47,951 --> 01:12:50,245
Hey, hey, hey, what's going on?

828
01:12:53,585 --> 01:12:55,962
Who's the mustache with the broken nose?

829
01:12:59,463 --> 01:13:02,175
That's Kenzie. Narcotics.

830
01:13:02,177 --> 01:13:05,097
He's one of the guys I got into it with
at the Iceberg Lounge.

831
01:13:06,014 --> 01:13:08,642
What are you saying?
Kenzie moonlights for the Penguin?

832
01:13:11,353 --> 01:13:13,313
Or he moonlights as a cop.

833
01:13:17,606 --> 01:13:19,484
- Jesus Christ!
- Go!

834
01:13:19,486 --> 01:13:20,987
Somebody stop him!

835
01:13:59,192 --> 01:14:00,736
- There he is!
- Freeze!

836
01:14:47,115 --> 01:14:49,034
Could have at least pulled that punch, man.

837
01:14:49,364 --> 01:14:50,855
I did.

838
01:14:50,869 --> 01:14:54,329
Bock put out an APB on you.
You really think he's in on this?

839
01:14:54,331 --> 01:14:56,386
I don't trust any of 'em. Do you?

840
01:14:56,388 --> 01:14:57,584
I only trust you.

841
01:14:57,581 --> 01:15:00,085
What's a narcotics cop doing
with Falcone's right-hand man?

842
01:15:00,087 --> 01:15:03,465
Colson said, "Cops protect the rat."
Maybe Kenzie's part of it.

843
01:15:04,216 --> 01:15:05,423
You think Penguin's the rat?

844
01:15:05,425 --> 01:15:08,551
His club caters to the mob.
Maroni practically lived there.

845
01:15:08,553 --> 01:15:10,514
Penguin would have been
privy to a lot of dirt.

846
01:15:10,506 --> 01:15:12,013
DA was a regular too.

847
01:15:12,015 --> 01:15:15,519
Maybe Penguin got himself into a jam
and working a deal was his only way out.

848
01:15:16,558 --> 01:15:17,894
The Rata Alada.

849
01:15:17,896 --> 01:15:18,937
The what?

850
01:15:18,939 --> 01:15:22,222
Riddler's latest. The cipher in the maze.

851
01:15:22,231 --> 01:15:24,734
It means "a rat with wings".
Like a stool pigeon.

852
01:15:26,363 --> 01:15:27,989
A penguin's got wings too.

853
01:15:29,780 --> 01:15:32,033
Time for me
to have another conversation with him.

854
01:15:32,035 --> 01:15:33,703
What about the Riddler? 
He's gonna kill again.

855
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:37,080
It's all connected.
Like it or not, it's his game now.

856
01:15:37,082 --> 01:15:39,988
You want to find Riddler,
we gotta find that rat.

857
01:15:42,879 --> 01:15:44,910
Kenzie and the twins, coming your way.

858
01:15:45,796 --> 01:15:47,048
There's Penguin.

859
01:15:47,050 --> 01:15:48,927
I wonder what's in the bags.

860
01:15:50,384 --> 01:15:51,824
You want to move in?

861
01:15:53,554 --> 01:15:55,014
Let's follow.

862
01:16:13,651 --> 01:16:17,196
They stopped at Waterfront Street.
The recycling plant.

863
01:16:17,198 --> 01:16:18,579
I'm here.

864
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,750
- How you doing?
- Yeah, good. How are you?

865
01:16:21,752 --> 01:16:24,254
Good, good. 
Let's get in out of this deluge.

866
01:16:43,482 --> 01:16:46,026
It's a drug lab. Drops.

867
01:16:46,028 --> 01:16:47,400
This is a buy.

868
01:16:47,402 --> 01:16:50,253
Looks like they got Maroni's operation
up and running again.

869
01:16:50,261 --> 01:16:52,863
- Or they never shut it down at all.
- What are you saying?

870
01:16:52,866 --> 01:16:55,994
The biggest drug bust in GCPD history
was a fraud?

871
01:17:20,352 --> 01:17:21,770
This just got complicated.

872
01:17:22,392 --> 01:17:23,559
What do you mean?

873
01:17:29,399 --> 01:17:30,254
Hey!

874
01:17:30,271 --> 01:17:32,486
What happened? You all right?

875
01:17:43,121 --> 01:17:45,079
Dangerous crowd you're stealing from.

876
01:17:45,494 --> 01:17:46,750
Jesus.

877
01:17:47,504 --> 01:17:51,256
Is this how you get your kicks, hon?
Sneaking up on girls in the dark?

878
01:17:51,258 --> 01:17:54,743
Is that why you work in the club?
It was all just a score?

879
01:17:54,753 --> 01:17:58,755
I would love to sit and go over
every gory detail with you, bat boy,

880
01:17:58,757 --> 01:18:01,932
but, uh, those assholes are coming back.

881
01:18:13,238 --> 01:18:14,197
Jesus!

882
01:18:42,809 --> 01:18:43,935
Hey, Vengeance!

883
01:18:46,018 --> 01:18:48,729
You think you can come after my money, huh?

884
01:19:29,689 --> 01:19:31,316
Kenzie! Get the money!

885
01:19:36,745 --> 01:19:37,996
Hey! What the...

886
01:20:28,623 --> 01:20:29,958
Whoa!

887
01:20:33,170 --> 01:20:34,755
Come on! Come on!

888
01:20:37,924 --> 01:20:39,259
This guy's crazy!

889
01:20:41,011 --> 01:20:42,721
Come on! Hey!

890
01:21:32,187 --> 01:21:33,188
Move!

891
01:22:38,003 --> 01:22:39,880
Get out of the way!

892
01:22:51,016 --> 01:22:52,100
Come on!

893
01:23:00,817 --> 01:23:01,943
Get out of the way!

894
01:23:39,189 --> 01:23:41,233
I got you!

895
01:23:42,439 --> 01:23:43,900
I got you!

896
01:23:43,902 --> 01:23:46,319
Take that, you friggin' psycho!

897
01:23:46,321 --> 01:23:47,781
I got you!

898
01:25:04,104 --> 01:25:07,150
What the hell is this? 
Good cop, batshit cop?

899
01:25:07,152 --> 01:25:08,304
Who's the Riddler?

900
01:25:08,305 --> 01:25:09,861
Riddler? How should I know?

901
01:25:09,863 --> 01:25:11,237
Let's make it easy for you, Oz.

902
01:25:11,239 --> 01:25:12,739
Cops caught you doing something.

903
01:25:12,741 --> 01:25:14,449
They were gonna shut you down,
put you away.

904
01:25:14,451 --> 01:25:16,409
So you gave up a bigger fish
to save your ass.

905
01:25:16,411 --> 01:25:18,538
You ratted out Salvatore Maroni.

906
01:25:18,535 --> 01:25:19,913
His drops operation.

907
01:25:19,915 --> 01:25:23,711
But the cops, the city officials, 
the mayor, the DA, they got greedy, right?

908
01:25:23,712 --> 01:25:26,169
Wasn't enough, a big career-making bust.

909
01:25:26,171 --> 01:25:28,004
They wanted to take over
the drops business too,

910
01:25:28,006 --> 01:25:30,423
but they needed a minor league mope
like you to run it.

911
01:25:30,425 --> 01:25:33,718
You don't just work for Carmine Falcone.
You work for them too.

912
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:36,137
- What are you, crazy?
- That why you killed the girl?

913
01:25:36,139 --> 01:25:37,180
I didn't kill no girl!

914
01:25:37,182 --> 01:25:39,057
We know she worked for you
at the 44 Below.

915
01:25:39,059 --> 01:25:40,421
But she got too close, right?

916
01:25:40,435 --> 01:25:42,807
Found out from Mitchell that you were
the rat, so you killed her.

917
01:25:42,809 --> 01:25:44,601
But somehow Riddler found out too.

918
01:25:44,603 --> 01:25:47,828
He knows so much about you.
You must know about him.

919
01:25:47,829 --> 01:25:48,819
Who is he?

920
01:25:49,316 --> 01:25:53,198
Boy, you guys are a hell of a duet here.
Why don't you start harmonizing?

921
01:25:53,403 --> 01:25:56,265
There's only one problem
with your little scenario, okay?

922
01:25:56,284 --> 01:25:57,700
I ain't no rat!

923
01:25:57,702 --> 01:26:00,773
You got any idea what Carmine Falcone would
do to me if he heard this kind of talk?

924
01:26:00,775 --> 01:26:02,944
Oh, you don't wanna talk about rats, huh?

925
01:26:02,955 --> 01:26:05,523
Maybe we can talk about
what they did to my partner's face.

926
01:26:05,541 --> 01:26:08,117
- Holy God, what are you showing me here?
- This was around his head!

927
01:26:08,121 --> 01:26:10,671
- Come on!
- Open your eyes!

928
01:26:14,716 --> 01:26:16,591
Are you El Rata Alada?

929
01:26:16,593 --> 01:26:18,094
El Rata Alada?

930
01:26:18,095 --> 01:26:20,673
Yeah, a "rat with wings". A stool pigeon.
That's not you?

931
01:26:20,675 --> 01:26:25,103
The symbols in the maze, right here.
It says you are El Rata Alada.

932
01:26:25,105 --> 01:26:27,687
- "You are El Rata"? It says that?
- Why, you got something to tell us?

933
01:26:27,688 --> 01:26:28,741
Yeah!

934
01:26:29,189 --> 01:26:30,525
It's, like, the worst Spanish
I ever heard.

935
01:26:30,527 --> 01:26:31,491
What?

936
01:26:31,650 --> 01:26:34,624
It's "La". "La" rata.

937
01:26:34,903 --> 01:26:37,073
What, is this Riddler stupid or something?

938
01:26:37,075 --> 01:26:39,077
Jesus! Look at you two.

939
01:26:39,283 --> 01:26:41,535
World's greatest detectives!

940
01:26:41,869 --> 01:26:44,494
Am I the only here knows the difference
between "el" and "la"?

941
01:26:44,496 --> 01:26:45,580
Jesus!

942
01:26:45,581 --> 01:26:47,082
No habla español, fellas?

943
01:26:47,082 --> 01:26:49,084
Do me a favor, shithead, shut up!

944
01:26:50,589 --> 01:26:51,836
You think he made a mistake?

945
01:26:51,838 --> 01:26:53,047
He doesn't make mistakes.

946
01:26:53,049 --> 01:26:54,174
A rat with wings?

947
01:26:54,176 --> 01:26:55,842
You know what that sounds like to me?

948
01:26:55,844 --> 01:26:59,014
A friggin' bat! Huh? 
You ever think of that?

949
01:26:59,016 --> 01:27:01,110
"You are El Rata."

950
01:27:06,643 --> 01:27:10,522
"You are el."

951
01:27:19,265 --> 01:27:22,026
Maybe it was a mistake.
Maybe he isn't as smart as-

952
01:27:22,028 --> 01:27:22,951
Wait.

953
01:27:26,374 --> 01:27:27,709
Is that him?

954
01:27:28,665 --> 01:27:30,500
Holy shit.

955
01:27:50,315 --> 01:27:51,900
What the hell does that mean?
Is he or isn't he?

956
01:28:21,304 --> 01:28:24,933
"I grew up from a seed, tough as a weed.

957
01:28:24,935 --> 01:28:29,855
"But in a mansion, in a slum,
I'll never know where I come from.

958
01:28:30,678 --> 01:28:32,013
"Do you know what I am?"

959
01:28:32,015 --> 01:28:33,146
Any idea?

960
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:34,679
Yeah.

961
01:28:35,941 --> 01:28:37,265
It's an orphan.

962
01:28:46,201 --> 01:28:48,148
A mansion in a slum.

963
01:28:49,454 --> 01:28:52,208
- He's talking about the old orphanage.
- The one that burned down?

964
01:28:52,202 --> 01:28:56,837
It was part of the Wayne estate.
They donated it after they built the tower.

965
01:28:56,837 --> 01:28:58,132
Let's go.

966
01:29:00,302 --> 01:29:02,763
You guys realize I'm still here, right?

967
01:29:03,677 --> 01:29:06,725
You gonna untie me? How the hell 
am I supposed to get out of here?

968
01:29:10,645 --> 01:29:11,646
Hey!

969
01:29:13,106 --> 01:29:15,525
You goddamn sons of bitches!

970
01:29:30,704 --> 01:29:32,069
No guns.

971
01:29:32,998 --> 01:29:35,042
Yeah, man. That's your thing.

972
01:29:56,313 --> 01:29:57,528
What's that?

973
01:30:08,075 --> 01:30:09,993
Hey! Hey!

974
01:30:16,503 --> 01:30:17,712
Dropheads.

975
01:30:25,050 --> 01:30:26,676
What the hell is that?

976
01:30:38,355 --> 01:30:40,984
Thank you. Thank you so much.

977
01:30:40,986 --> 01:30:42,465
Wasn't that beautiful?

978
01:30:44,987 --> 01:30:47,031
Thank you all. Thank you, uh...

979
01:30:47,406 --> 01:30:48,991
Thank you for coming today.

980
01:30:50,701 --> 01:30:52,286
I believe in Gotham.

981
01:30:53,620 --> 01:30:55,413
I believe in its promise.

982
01:30:56,710 --> 01:31:00,712
But too many have been left behind
for too long,

983
01:31:00,714 --> 01:31:02,589
and that's why I'm here today.

984
01:31:02,591 --> 01:31:05,427
To announce,
not only my candidacy for mayor,

985
01:31:05,429 --> 01:31:09,092
but also the creation
of the Gotham Renewal Fund.

986
01:31:09,094 --> 01:31:10,971
Win or lose,

987
01:31:11,263 --> 01:31:14,601
the Wayne Foundation pledges
a $1 billion donation

988
01:31:14,603 --> 01:31:17,517
to start a charitable endowment
for public works.

989
01:31:17,519 --> 01:31:22,150
I want to bypass political gridlock,
and get money to people and projects

990
01:31:22,152 --> 01:31:25,695
who need it now, 
like these children behind me.

991
01:31:25,697 --> 01:31:27,110
"Sins of the father".

992
01:31:27,112 --> 01:31:28,921
Renewal is about growth.

993
01:31:28,922 --> 01:31:33,983
It is about planting seeds
and renewing Gotham's promise.

994
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:40,250
Shall be visited upon the son.

995
01:31:42,169 --> 01:31:45,297
Jesus. His next victim is Bruce Wayne.

996
01:31:49,843 --> 01:31:51,092
Hey!

997
01:32:51,116 --> 01:32:53,742
- Hello?
- Dory! I need to speak to Alfred!

998
01:32:53,744 --> 01:32:54,725
Oh, Mr. Wayne...

999
01:32:54,726 --> 01:32:55,660
Listen to me!

1000
01:32:55,662 --> 01:32:57,459
Something terrible is gonna happen!

1001
01:32:57,870 --> 01:32:59,955
I'm afraid it already has, sir.

1002
01:33:11,758 --> 01:33:13,510
About an hour ago.

1003
01:33:14,765 --> 01:33:16,433
I'm so sorry.

1004
01:33:17,848 --> 01:33:19,599
I've been trying to reach you.

1005
01:33:22,397 --> 01:33:24,065
The package was intended for you.

1006
01:33:24,608 --> 01:33:28,361
It was a C-4 explosive sent in a mailer.
We found this too.

1007
01:33:50,923 --> 01:33:54,429
We've sedated him.
We just have to hope he stabilizes.

1008
01:33:55,135 --> 01:33:57,846
You should go home, Mr. Wayne.
Get some sleep.

1009
01:33:58,456 --> 01:34:00,208
Is there anyone else to notify?

1010
01:34:01,645 --> 01:34:03,063
Next of kin?

1011
01:34:08,065 --> 01:34:09,149
No.

1012
01:34:10,192 --> 01:34:11,818
It's just me.

1013
01:35:54,922 --> 01:35:56,173
Selina?

1014
01:36:03,016 --> 01:36:04,017
Can you see me?

1015
01:36:07,017 --> 01:36:09,545
- Yeah, I can see you.
- I need to talk to you.

1016
01:36:10,440 --> 01:36:11,525
Where can we go?

1017
01:36:30,210 --> 01:36:32,129
Cat burglar pulling another score?

1018
01:36:33,084 --> 01:36:33,975
What?

1019
01:36:33,977 --> 01:36:35,755
Wasn't sure I'd see you again.

1020
01:36:35,757 --> 01:36:38,218
Yeah, well, things were getting
a little hot for me, so...

1021
01:36:38,715 --> 01:36:40,788
How could they do that to her?

1022
01:36:40,801 --> 01:36:42,762
That piece of shit cop, Kenzie.

1023
01:36:42,764 --> 01:36:44,683
Her body was in his car.

1024
01:36:44,680 --> 01:36:47,710
I'm gonna find him and I'm gonna
make him pay. You gonna help me?

1025
01:36:47,719 --> 01:36:48,687
Help you?

1026
01:36:48,688 --> 01:36:50,608
Yeah. I thought you were "Vengeance".

1027
01:36:50,610 --> 01:36:54,229
Your friend got involved with the
wrong people. She didn't know any better.

1028
01:36:54,231 --> 01:36:55,565
Maybe you should have explained it to her.

1029
01:36:55,569 --> 01:36:57,274
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

1030
01:36:57,276 --> 01:36:58,778
It means your choices have consequences.

1031
01:36:58,780 --> 01:37:00,803
Jesus Christ. "Choices"?

1032
01:37:01,113 --> 01:37:04,033
You know, whoever the hell you are,
you obviously grew up rich.

1033
01:37:04,035 --> 01:37:05,949
- Was it worth it?
- What?

1034
01:37:05,951 --> 01:37:08,120
Compromising yourself for money?

1035
01:37:09,750 --> 01:37:12,002
What did you have to do
to set up that score?

1036
01:37:13,453 --> 01:37:17,380
How close did you have to get
to Penguin? To Falcone?

1037
01:37:17,382 --> 01:37:20,297
You don't know what the hell you're
talking about. Falcone owes me that money.

1038
01:37:20,299 --> 01:37:22,051
- He owes you?
- Yeah, and a lot more.

1039
01:37:22,053 --> 01:37:23,835
- Oh, really? Why's that?
- You know what? I can't even talk to you.

1040
01:37:23,838 --> 01:37:26,805
No! I want to know why a guy like Falcone 
would owe you anything.

1041
01:37:26,805 --> 01:37:28,811
Because he's my father!

1042
01:37:38,025 --> 01:37:40,820
My mother worked at the 44 Below.

1043
01:37:42,613 --> 01:37:43,906
Just like Anni.

1044
01:37:46,074 --> 01:37:48,483
She used to take me there
when I was a little girl.

1045
01:37:50,631 --> 01:37:51,966
To the club?

1046
01:37:53,001 --> 01:37:54,002
Yeah.

1047
01:37:56,585 --> 01:37:59,335
I hid out in the dressing room
while she worked.

1048
01:37:59,932 --> 01:38:01,684
Used to see him there.

1049
01:38:02,552 --> 01:38:04,554
He scared the shit out of me.

1050
01:38:06,386 --> 01:38:09,847
And I could never understand
why he looked at me the way he did.

1051
01:38:10,432 --> 01:38:14,269
Then one night,
my mother told me who he was.

1052
01:38:17,606 --> 01:38:21,327
When I was seven, my mother
was murdered. Strangled.

1053
01:38:22,609 --> 01:38:26,071
Never found out who.
Probably some creep from the club.

1054
01:38:27,860 --> 01:38:32,264
Anyway, social services came 
to take me away, and he didn't say a thing.

1055
01:38:33,997 --> 01:38:35,791
Couldn't even look at me.

1056
01:38:39,644 --> 01:38:41,396
He owes me that money.

1057
01:38:43,090 --> 01:38:44,508
I'm sorry.

1058
01:38:45,676 --> 01:38:46,844
For what I said.

1059
01:38:48,348 --> 01:38:49,766
Oh, it's all right.

1060
01:38:53,311 --> 01:38:55,397
You assume the worst in people.

1061
01:38:56,314 --> 01:38:57,691
Which, well...

1062
01:38:59,940 --> 01:39:01,858
maybe we're not so different after all.

1063
01:39:07,367 --> 01:39:09,119
Who are you under there?

1064
01:39:15,163 --> 01:39:17,040
What are you hiding?

1065
01:39:19,418 --> 01:39:21,253
Are you just...

1066
01:39:22,838 --> 01:39:24,548
...hideously scarred?

1067
01:39:26,592 --> 01:39:27,749
Yeah.

1068
01:39:34,808 --> 01:39:36,226
Listen to me.

1069
01:39:37,769 --> 01:39:40,647
If we don't stand up for Annika,
no one will.

1070
01:39:41,940 --> 01:39:46,611
All anyone cares about in this place
are these white, privileged assholes.

1071
01:39:47,154 --> 01:39:50,532
The mayor, the commissioner, the DA.

1072
01:39:50,534 --> 01:39:51,785
Now Thomas and Bruce Wayne.

1073
01:39:51,787 --> 01:39:55,165
I mean, as far as I'm concerned, that
psycho's right to go after these creeps.

1074
01:39:55,162 --> 01:39:56,581
I think you'd be on his side.

1075
01:39:56,583 --> 01:39:58,291
What do you mean,
"Thomas and Bruce Wayne"?

1076
01:39:58,293 --> 01:40:00,253
What, do you live in a cave?

1077
01:40:00,255 --> 01:40:02,340
The Riddler's latest.
It's all about the Waynes.

1078
01:40:03,420 --> 01:40:08,678
Listen, if I can find that dickbag Kenzie,
will you help me?

1079
01:40:09,835 --> 01:40:11,128
Please.

1080
01:40:13,889 --> 01:40:15,808
Come on, Vengeance.

1081
01:40:18,343 --> 01:40:20,596
Just don't make any moves
without me, understand?

1082
01:40:20,598 --> 01:40:22,356
It's a little more dangerous than you know-

1083
01:40:31,910 --> 01:40:33,453
I told you, baby.

1084
01:40:35,327 --> 01:40:37,913
I can take care of myself.

1085
01:40:48,760 --> 01:40:52,055
I'm Thomas Wayne, 
and I approve this message.

1086
01:40:59,875 --> 01:41:03,478
From a very young age, my family,
Martha's family, the Arkhams

1087
01:41:03,480 --> 01:41:08,236
instilled in both of us
that giving back is not just an obligation,

1088
01:41:08,238 --> 01:41:09,698
it's a passion.

1089
01:41:10,153 --> 01:41:12,819
That is our family's legacy.

1090
01:41:13,657 --> 01:41:16,272
The Waynes and the Arkhams.

1091
01:41:16,285 --> 01:41:18,746
Gotham's founding families.

1092
01:41:18,745 --> 01:41:21,915
But what is their real legacy?

1093
01:41:23,161 --> 01:41:28,086
Twenty years ago, one reporter set out
to uncover the dark truth.

1094
01:41:28,088 --> 01:41:31,758
He found shocking family secrets.

1095
01:41:32,176 --> 01:41:36,683
How, when Martha was just a child,
her mother brutally murdered her father,

1096
01:41:36,680 --> 01:41:38,475
then committed suicide

1097
01:41:38,477 --> 01:41:44,060
and how the Arkhams used their power
and money to cover it up.

1098
01:41:44,062 --> 01:41:48,530
How Martha herself was
in and out of institutions for years

1099
01:41:48,525 --> 01:41:51,061
and they didn't want anyone to know.

1100
01:41:51,901 --> 01:41:55,952
Thomas Wayne tried to force this crusading
reporter into a hush-money agreement

1101
01:41:55,953 --> 01:41:58,992
to save his mayoral campaign.

1102
01:41:58,994 --> 01:42:01,289
But when the reporter refused,

1103
01:42:01,291 --> 01:42:08,175
Wayne turned to longtime secret associate
Carmine Falcone and had him murdered!

1104
01:42:08,587 --> 01:42:12,008
The Waynes and the Arkhams,

1105
01:42:12,010 --> 01:42:17,552
Gotham's legacy of lies and murder.

1106
01:42:17,554 --> 01:42:19,991
I hope you're listening, Bruce Wayne.

1107
01:42:20,015 --> 01:42:22,392
This is your legacy too.

1108
01:42:22,405 --> 01:42:29,027
And Gotham needs you to answer
for the sins of your father.

1109
01:42:30,359 --> 01:42:32,195
Goodbye.

1110
01:42:38,161 --> 01:42:39,246
Do you know who I am?

1111
01:42:40,867 --> 01:42:41,993
You're Bruce Wayne.

1112
01:42:41,995 --> 01:42:43,879
I wanna see Carmine Falcone.

1113
01:42:54,719 --> 01:42:55,720
See?

1114
01:43:07,023 --> 01:43:09,651
Who is this guy 
who invented the ball, right?

1115
01:43:10,482 --> 01:43:12,986
Must have made a fortune.

1116
01:43:12,988 --> 01:43:14,740
If you think about it, 
the concept of it, right?

1117
01:43:16,154 --> 01:43:18,783
Briscoe, do you know
how much this sweater cost?

1118
01:43:18,785 --> 01:43:19,585
No, boss.

1119
01:43:19,575 --> 01:43:21,910
$1,183.

1120
01:43:22,661 --> 01:43:24,831
You know why communism failed, right?

1121
01:43:24,833 --> 01:43:25,960
No, boss.

1122
01:43:27,690 --> 01:43:29,030
Austerity.

1123
01:43:31,170 --> 01:43:33,092
All right. All right.

1124
01:43:33,735 --> 01:43:35,297
Look at that. Perfect.

1125
01:43:35,299 --> 01:43:37,170
It's never gonna be that good again.

1126
01:43:39,469 --> 01:43:41,971
Hey, Johnny Slick.

1127
01:43:41,966 --> 01:43:43,600
What are you doing here?

1128
01:43:45,184 --> 01:43:47,019
Give us a moment here, fellas.

1129
01:43:47,811 --> 01:43:48,853
Come on.

1130
01:43:50,939 --> 01:43:52,149
See ya, champ.

1131
01:43:52,983 --> 01:43:54,452
Come on, sweetheart.

1132
01:43:56,397 --> 01:43:57,483
Have a seat.

1133
01:43:59,281 --> 01:44:01,074
I thought I might hear from you.

1134
01:44:02,242 --> 01:44:05,460
This, uh, 
Riddler son of a bitch is really...

1135
01:44:06,914 --> 01:44:08,866
...stirring things up, huh?

1136
01:44:08,874 --> 01:44:10,584
- Is it true?
- What?

1137
01:44:11,919 --> 01:44:13,546
That reporter business?

1138
01:44:14,838 --> 01:44:16,296
What do you want to know here, kid?

1139
01:44:16,298 --> 01:44:19,092
Did you kill him? For my father?

1140
01:44:19,096 --> 01:44:21,848
Look, your father was in trouble.

1141
01:44:22,554 --> 01:44:26,228
This reporter had some dirt. Some very...

1142
01:44:27,267 --> 01:44:31,231
...personal stuff about your mother,
her family history.

1143
01:44:31,233 --> 01:44:34,024
Everybody's got their dirty laundry,
that's just how it is.

1144
01:44:34,027 --> 01:44:37,389
But he didn't want none of it coming out,
not right before the election.

1145
01:44:37,814 --> 01:44:41,947
And your father tried to pay the guy off, 
but he wasn't going for it.

1146
01:44:41,949 --> 01:44:45,110
So, he came to me.

1147
01:44:45,112 --> 01:44:47,663
Well, I never seen him like that.

1148
01:44:48,580 --> 01:44:55,702
He said, "Carmine, I want you
to put the fear of God in this guy."

1149
01:44:58,260 --> 01:45:01,179
And when fear isn't enough...

1150
01:45:01,847 --> 01:45:03,682
Oof. Hmm.

1151
01:45:04,972 --> 01:45:08,309
Your father wanted me to handle it,
so I did.

1152
01:45:09,283 --> 01:45:11,118
I handled it.

1153
01:45:12,805 --> 01:45:14,223
I know.

1154
01:45:14,225 --> 01:45:16,483
You thought your father was a Boy Scout.

1155
01:45:17,776 --> 01:45:19,612
But you'd be surprised

1156
01:45:19,611 --> 01:45:24,867
what even a good man like him
is capable of in the right situation.

1157
01:45:26,994 --> 01:45:28,454
Do me a favor.

1158
01:45:28,727 --> 01:45:30,771
Don't lose any sleep over it.

1159
01:45:31,550 --> 01:45:35,596
This reporter was a lowlife.

1160
01:45:35,621 --> 01:45:37,212
He was on Maroni's payroll.

1161
01:45:38,842 --> 01:45:40,807
- Maroni?
- Oh, yeah.

1162
01:45:41,133 --> 01:45:44,387
He could never stand
your father and I had history.

1163
01:45:45,679 --> 01:45:47,589
And after what happened with that reporter,

1164
01:45:47,591 --> 01:45:52,561
Maroni was worried 
that your father would be in my pocket,

1165
01:45:52,564 --> 01:45:53,565
forever.

1166
01:45:54,010 --> 01:45:58,517
He would have done anything
to keep him from becoming mayor.

1167
01:45:58,519 --> 01:45:59,943
You understand?

1168
01:46:01,153 --> 01:46:05,699
Are you saying Salvatore Maroni
got my father killed?

1169
01:46:05,699 --> 01:46:07,742
Do I know it for a fact?

1170
01:46:10,162 --> 01:46:12,248
I'm just saying,
it sure looked that way to me.

1171
01:46:13,538 --> 01:46:18,143
This is what you wanted, huh?
This little conversation here?

1172
01:46:20,926 --> 01:46:23,095
It's been a long time coming, huh?

1173
01:46:25,677 --> 01:46:27,804
I mean, you ain't a kid no more.

1174
01:47:37,110 --> 01:47:38,403
You lied to me...

1175
01:47:41,128 --> 01:47:42,755
...my whole life.

1176
01:47:47,968 --> 01:47:50,011
I spoke to Carmine Falcone.

1177
01:47:52,890 --> 01:47:56,185
He told me what he did for my father.

1178
01:48:00,522 --> 01:48:02,062
About Salvatore Maroni.

1179
01:48:03,807 --> 01:48:06,818
He told you Salvatore Maroni-

1180
01:48:06,820 --> 01:48:08,571
Had my father killed.

1181
01:48:10,908 --> 01:48:13,119
Why didn't you tell me all this?

1182
01:48:15,948 --> 01:48:20,790
All these years 
I've spent fighting for him,

1183
01:48:20,792 --> 01:48:23,128
believing that he was a good man.

1184
01:48:23,131 --> 01:48:24,716
He was a good man.

1185
01:48:25,702 --> 01:48:27,589
You listen to me.

1186
01:48:27,591 --> 01:48:31,012
Your father was a good man.

1187
01:48:34,598 --> 01:48:36,726
- He made a mistake.
- A "mistake".

1188
01:48:36,728 --> 01:48:39,734
He had a man killed. Why?

1189
01:48:41,557 --> 01:48:44,156
To protect his family image?

1190
01:48:45,242 --> 01:48:46,653
His political aspirations?

1191
01:48:46,655 --> 01:48:50,200
It wasn't to protect the family image,
and he didn't have anyone killed.

1192
01:48:52,699 --> 01:48:54,344
He was protecting your mother.

1193
01:48:55,160 --> 01:48:58,773
He didn't care about his image
or the campaign, any of that.

1194
01:48:58,789 --> 01:49:00,916
He cared about her,

1195
01:49:00,918 --> 01:49:02,502
and you,

1196
01:49:02,504 --> 01:49:05,424
and in a moment of weakness,
he turned to Falcone.

1197
01:49:05,426 --> 01:49:08,888
But he never thought
Falcone would kill that man.

1198
01:49:09,716 --> 01:49:11,571
Your father should have known

1199
01:49:11,572 --> 01:49:16,393
that Falcone would do anything to finally
have something on him that he could use.

1200
01:49:16,395 --> 01:49:18,230
That's who Falcone is.

1201
01:49:20,394 --> 01:49:22,936
And that was your father's mistake.

1202
01:49:22,938 --> 01:49:27,738
But when Falcone told him what he'd done, 
your father was distraught.

1203
01:49:28,443 --> 01:49:33,949
He told Falcone he was going to the police,
that he would confess everything.

1204
01:49:35,445 --> 01:49:41,457
And that night,
your father and your mother were killed.

1205
01:49:46,879 --> 01:49:48,631
It was Falcone?

1206
01:49:54,890 --> 01:49:57,017
Oh, I wish I knew for sure.

1207
01:50:01,730 --> 01:50:05,275
Or maybe it was some random thug
on the street

1208
01:50:05,277 --> 01:50:08,193
who needed money, got scared,
and pulled the trigger too fast.

1209
01:50:08,195 --> 01:50:13,408
If you don't think I've spent every day
searching for that answer...

1210
01:50:15,032 --> 01:50:18,911
It was my job to protect them.
Do you understand?

1211
01:50:19,620 --> 01:50:21,581
I know you always blamed yourself.

1212
01:50:21,583 --> 01:50:24,127
You were only a boy, Bruce.

1213
01:50:26,168 --> 01:50:28,634
I could see the fear in your eyes,

1214
01:50:29,755 --> 01:50:32,467
but I didn't know how to help.

1215
01:50:32,469 --> 01:50:39,017
I could teach you how to fight, 
but I wasn't equipped to take care of you.

1216
01:50:39,014 --> 01:50:40,856
You needed a father.

1217
01:50:42,708 --> 01:50:45,127
And all you had was me.

1218
01:50:47,564 --> 01:50:48,774
I'm sorry.

1219
01:50:50,567 --> 01:50:52,485
Don't be sorry, Alfred.

1220
01:50:59,201 --> 01:51:00,329
God.

1221
01:51:03,406 --> 01:51:07,827
I never thought 
I'd feel fear like that again.

1222
01:51:10,504 --> 01:51:12,631
I thought I'd mastered all that.

1223
01:51:18,971 --> 01:51:20,223
I mean,

1224
01:51:21,390 --> 01:51:23,517
I'm not afraid to die.

1225
01:51:25,269 --> 01:51:30,663
I realize now there's something
I haven't got past.

1226
01:51:31,679 --> 01:51:33,431
This fear...

1227
01:51:36,032 --> 01:51:38,764
...of ever going through any of that again.

1228
01:51:43,161 --> 01:51:45,372
Of losing somebody I care about.

1229
01:52:35,923 --> 01:52:37,092
Hey.

1230
01:52:37,094 --> 01:52:39,966
I saw the signal. That's not you?

1231
01:52:39,968 --> 01:52:41,886
I thought it was you.

1232
01:52:54,525 --> 01:52:55,544
I found him!

1233
01:52:55,545 --> 01:52:56,483
I see that.

1234
01:52:56,485 --> 01:52:57,986
He had my shit and my phone.

1235
01:52:57,989 --> 01:53:00,340
She left a message the night they took her.
She called me...

1236
01:53:00,364 --> 01:53:02,155
Gordon! Help me out, man!

1237
01:53:02,157 --> 01:53:03,450
She got my gun!

1238
01:53:04,618 --> 01:53:05,520
Shut up!

1239
01:53:05,521 --> 01:53:06,692
Put the gun down.

1240
01:53:07,958 --> 01:53:10,502
I'm telling you, God damn it! 
She called me!

1241
01:53:15,706 --> 01:53:17,172
Here. Listen.

1242
01:53:18,757 --> 01:53:20,785
Hey! Get back here!

1243
01:53:21,112 --> 01:53:23,163
Where you going? Come back here!

1244
01:53:23,176 --> 01:53:26,848
Hey, hey, what are you doing, Kenzie?
You're scaring her.

1245
01:53:26,850 --> 01:53:28,560
I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone.

1246
01:53:28,562 --> 01:53:31,061
Please, please, please.
Please, don't hurt me, please.

1247
01:53:31,064 --> 01:53:33,734
Hey, don't be scared. Come here.

1248
01:53:35,607 --> 01:53:37,739
Now let me ask you again.

1249
01:53:38,235 --> 01:53:40,989
- What did Mitchell tell you?
- No, nothing. He...

1250
01:53:40,991 --> 01:53:43,905
Don liked to talk. I know that.

1251
01:53:43,907 --> 01:53:46,618
Especially to pretty girls like you.

1252
01:53:47,234 --> 01:53:49,953
That's why I made him take your passport

1253
01:53:49,955 --> 01:53:52,831
until we could have 
this little conversation.

1254
01:53:52,833 --> 01:53:55,712
All I want to do is get out of here, okay?

1255
01:53:55,714 --> 01:53:57,841
You'll never hear from me again,
nobody will. Please, please...

1256
01:53:57,838 --> 01:54:00,966
We're gonna get you out of here, I promise.

1257
01:54:01,842 --> 01:54:04,386
But first, I gotta know...

1258
01:54:05,391 --> 01:54:06,880
What did he tell you?

1259
01:54:06,882 --> 01:54:11,686
H-He just said 
they all made a deal with you.

1260
01:54:11,688 --> 01:54:16,207
Oh. Hmm. He told you about that, huh?
The deal.

1261
01:54:16,209 --> 01:54:21,404
He said you gave some information 
on some drops thing

1262
01:54:21,406 --> 01:54:24,112
and that's how he became mayor.

1263
01:54:24,114 --> 01:54:26,659
He said you were a very important man.

1264
01:54:26,661 --> 01:54:27,788
Right.

1265
01:54:28,327 --> 01:54:29,704
Mm-hmm.

1266
01:54:30,829 --> 01:54:32,998
Hmm. Okay.

1267
01:54:40,621 --> 01:54:41,963
Just take it easy.

1268
01:54:41,965 --> 01:54:43,760
Jesus, he's strangling her.

1269
01:54:43,762 --> 01:54:46,807
Take it easy.

1270
01:54:55,938 --> 01:54:57,231
Rata Alada.

1271
01:55:02,072 --> 01:55:03,778
A falcon has wings too.

1272
01:55:04,029 --> 01:55:05,864
Falcone is the rat?

1273
01:55:17,084 --> 01:55:20,585
Falcone works for you guys?

1274
01:55:20,587 --> 01:55:23,131
The mayor? The DA?

1275
01:55:26,176 --> 01:55:27,353
No.

1276
01:55:30,559 --> 01:55:31,852
We work for him.

1277
01:55:32,766 --> 01:55:34,185
Everybody does.

1278
01:55:34,187 --> 01:55:35,270
How?

1279
01:55:35,272 --> 01:55:36,857
Through Renewal.

1280
01:55:37,519 --> 01:55:38,895
Renewal is everything.

1281
01:55:38,897 --> 01:55:40,564
- The Renewal Fund?
- Yeah.

1282
01:55:40,816 --> 01:55:44,821
After Thomas Wayne died,
they all went after it like vultures.

1283
01:55:44,823 --> 01:55:48,572
The mayor, Falcone, Maroni.
Everyone got in on it.

1284
01:55:48,574 --> 01:55:51,953
It was perfect for making bribes,
laundering money.

1285
01:55:51,955 --> 01:55:55,915
A huge charitable fund with no oversight.
Everybody got a piece.

1286
01:55:55,917 --> 01:55:57,753
But Falcone wanted more.

1287
01:55:59,444 --> 01:56:02,656
So he orchestrated a play
to take Maroni down big.

1288
01:56:04,089 --> 01:56:06,424
He'd rat out his drops operation,

1289
01:56:06,675 --> 01:56:09,679
make the careers of everybody
that went after him,

1290
01:56:09,681 --> 01:56:12,137
then install them all as his puppets.

1291
01:56:12,139 --> 01:56:14,684
You think this goddamn election matters?

1292
01:56:16,268 --> 01:56:18,187
Falcone's the mayor.

1293
01:56:19,104 --> 01:56:21,858
He's been the mayor for the last 20 years.

1294
01:56:21,860 --> 01:56:23,236
Come on, Vengeance.

1295
01:56:23,945 --> 01:56:25,781
Let's go kill that son of a bitch.

1296
01:56:26,320 --> 01:56:28,198
- This creep too. Let's finish this.
- Oh, God!

1297
01:56:28,200 --> 01:56:29,189
No!

1298
01:56:30,407 --> 01:56:33,111
We'll get him. But not that way.

1299
01:56:33,112 --> 01:56:35,457
There is no other way! He owns the city!

1300
01:56:35,459 --> 01:56:38,845
Cross that line... 
you'll become just like him.

1301
01:56:39,581 --> 01:56:41,124
Listen to me.

1302
01:56:41,126 --> 01:56:43,003
Don't throw your life away.

1303
01:56:49,638 --> 01:56:51,014
Don't worry, honey.

1304
01:56:54,056 --> 01:56:55,515
I got nine of 'em.

1305
01:56:55,685 --> 01:56:57,646
No, don't! Hey, hey!

1306
01:56:58,939 --> 01:57:00,232
Oh, God!

1307
01:57:09,522 --> 01:57:10,824
She won't get out of there alive.

1308
01:57:10,826 --> 01:57:13,412
And if she kills Falcone,
we may never find the Riddler.

1309
01:57:13,414 --> 01:57:14,661
I have to stop her.

1310
01:57:14,663 --> 01:57:15,736
Don't you mean "we"?

1311
01:57:16,957 --> 01:57:18,500
I gotta do this my way.

1312
01:57:18,747 --> 01:57:19,822
And then what?

1313
01:57:20,666 --> 01:57:22,189
We do what Riddler said.

1314
01:57:22,835 --> 01:57:24,572
Bring the rat into the light.

1315
01:58:00,411 --> 01:58:02,455
Can you tell Mr. Falcone
I'd like to come up?

1316
01:58:02,457 --> 01:58:03,917
He ain't seein' nobody tonight.

1317
01:58:04,543 --> 01:58:05,877
Tell him it's about Annika.

1318
01:58:09,297 --> 01:58:12,841
Hey! Look who it is, huh?

1319
01:58:12,843 --> 01:58:15,472
- Sorry to bother you.
- Nah. It's fine, beautiful.

1320
01:58:15,474 --> 01:58:17,640
I was just hoping
I could talk to you for a minute?

1321
01:58:17,642 --> 01:58:19,102
Absolutely.

1322
01:58:20,726 --> 01:58:21,727
Alone?

1323
01:58:38,413 --> 01:58:39,498
Hey!

1324
01:58:49,630 --> 01:58:52,969
I'm just so worried.
I don't know where she is.

1325
01:58:54,676 --> 01:58:58,055
And I know
that you're a very important man.

1326
01:58:58,057 --> 01:59:01,477
I was hoping that maybe
you could help me find her...

1327
01:59:03,105 --> 01:59:05,710
because she's been gone so long,
I'm beginning to...

1328
01:59:06,890 --> 01:59:08,274
I'm sorry.

1329
01:59:08,276 --> 01:59:09,361
It's okay.

1330
01:59:09,358 --> 01:59:11,485
- I'm so sorry.
- I understand. Here.

1331
01:59:11,693 --> 01:59:14,571
No, that's okay, I have a tissue.

1332
01:59:18,742 --> 01:59:19,660
Mr. Falcone?

1333
01:59:19,660 --> 01:59:21,194
Vinnie! Didn't I tell you?

1334
01:59:21,203 --> 01:59:24,122
I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone. I really think
you're gonna want to see this.

1335
01:59:26,542 --> 01:59:28,288
I'm sorry, beautiful.

1336
01:59:28,296 --> 01:59:29,714
I'll be right back.

1337
01:59:45,016 --> 01:59:46,101
Holy shit.

1338
01:59:46,103 --> 01:59:50,733
That recording, provided to GC-1 by
Lieutenant James Gordon of the Gotham PD.

1339
01:59:50,736 --> 01:59:53,572
And we should warn you,
the contents are extremely graphic

1340
01:59:53,574 --> 01:59:55,785
and some of you may find it disturbing.

1341
01:59:56,405 --> 02:00:00,118
He just said they all made a deal with you.

1342
02:00:00,120 --> 02:00:05,163
Oh. Hmm. He told you about that, huh? 
The deal.

1343
02:00:05,167 --> 02:00:10,125
He said you gave some information 
on some drops thing

1344
02:00:10,127 --> 02:00:13,047
and that's how he became mayor.

1345
02:00:13,049 --> 02:00:15,577
He said you were a very important man.

1346
02:00:15,583 --> 02:00:16,592
Right.

1347
02:00:17,426 --> 02:00:18,631
Hmm.

1348
02:00:18,635 --> 02:00:19,844
Okay.

1349
02:00:27,144 --> 02:00:31,563
Revelations of Mr. Falcone's
secret role as a mafia informant...

1350
02:00:31,565 --> 02:00:32,816
Hey, Dad.

1351
02:00:33,904 --> 02:00:34,905
What?

1352
02:00:35,152 --> 02:00:37,196
I'm Maria Kyle's kid.

1353
02:00:39,034 --> 02:00:40,494
You remember her?

1354
02:00:42,409 --> 02:00:43,452
Yeah.

1355
02:00:45,122 --> 02:00:46,145
Just...

1356
02:00:47,866 --> 02:00:49,041
Just put down the gun, honey.

1357
02:00:49,044 --> 02:00:50,176
This is for my mother.

1358
02:01:47,474 --> 02:01:48,642
I see him!

1359
02:02:32,477 --> 02:02:34,228
You don't think this hurts me?

1360
02:02:38,775 --> 02:02:41,199
My own flesh and blood, huh?

1361
02:02:57,586 --> 02:02:59,481
You made me do this.

1362
02:03:00,672 --> 02:03:02,465
Just like your mother.

1363
02:03:08,555 --> 02:03:09,910
He has to pay!

1364
02:03:13,939 --> 02:03:15,191
You don't have to pay with him.

1365
02:03:18,693 --> 02:03:20,195
You paid enough.

1366
02:03:54,560 --> 02:03:58,685
Jesus. Look at you, man.
What do you think this is?

1367
02:03:58,689 --> 02:04:01,783
You think you're gonna scare me
with that mask and that cape?

1368
02:04:01,768 --> 02:04:05,695
I'm gonna start crying, and all of 
a sudden, some big secret's comin' out?

1369
02:04:05,696 --> 02:04:07,574
Let me tell you something.

1370
02:04:07,565 --> 02:04:09,240
Whatever I know,

1371
02:04:09,241 --> 02:04:11,201
whatever I've done,

1372
02:04:11,201 --> 02:04:15,539
it's all going with me to my grave.

1373
02:04:26,042 --> 02:04:28,177
What, are you with Zorro over here?

1374
02:04:29,337 --> 02:04:32,097
Don't you know you boys in blue
work for me?

1375
02:04:39,938 --> 02:04:42,273
I guess we don't all work for you.

1376
02:04:51,314 --> 02:04:53,060
You have the right to remain silent.

1377
02:04:53,452 --> 02:04:57,332
Anything you say can and will
be used against you in a court of law.

1378
02:04:57,334 --> 02:04:58,830
You have the right to an attorney.

1379
02:04:58,832 --> 02:05:01,797
If you cannot afford one,
the City of Gotham will provide one to you.

1380
02:05:01,793 --> 02:05:03,503
Do you understand these rights?

1381
02:05:04,838 --> 02:05:06,422
Do you understand?

1382
02:05:08,637 --> 02:05:09,803
Yeah.

1383
02:05:09,805 --> 02:05:11,763
I'll see you when I walk out.

1384
02:05:11,765 --> 02:05:14,351
With these rights in mind, 
is there anything else you wish to tell...

1385
02:05:14,353 --> 02:05:15,748
Goddamn rat.

1386
02:05:17,476 --> 02:05:18,810
What'd you say?

1387
02:05:18,810 --> 02:05:20,935
Enjoy your night at Blackgate, Carmine.

1388
02:05:21,772 --> 02:05:23,232
Probably be your last.

1389
02:05:23,232 --> 02:05:26,569
Oh-ho. So you're a big man now, Oz?

1390
02:05:26,571 --> 02:05:27,466
Maybe I am.

1391
02:05:27,468 --> 02:05:28,860
Really, Oz?

1392
02:05:28,855 --> 02:05:33,825
Because to me, you were always
just a gimp in an empty suit.

1393
02:05:33,829 --> 02:05:35,130
I'll spray paint your ass!

1394
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:40,542
What are you doing? It wasn't me!

1395
02:05:40,544 --> 02:05:42,546
I didn't shoot! I didn't shoot!

1396
02:05:43,880 --> 02:05:45,340
Get your hands off of me!

1397
02:06:04,901 --> 02:06:06,903
"Bring him into the light.

1398
02:06:10,362 --> 02:06:12,378
"And you'll find where I'm at."

1399
02:06:12,380 --> 02:06:13,530
There!

1400
02:06:13,532 --> 02:06:15,367
The shots came from up there!

1401
02:06:17,327 --> 02:06:18,328
It's Riddler.

1402
02:06:19,997 --> 02:06:21,458
Gage, on me.

1403
02:06:21,460 --> 02:06:22,480
Martinez, around back.

1404
02:06:22,481 --> 02:06:24,479
Nobody gets in there, nobody gets out!

1405
02:07:38,283 --> 02:07:39,492
He's gone.

1406
02:07:49,201 --> 02:07:51,294
He's been here this whole time.

1407
02:07:51,296 --> 02:07:52,329
Lieutenant.

1408
02:07:52,331 --> 02:07:53,841
- Martinez.
- Yeah?

1409
02:07:53,844 --> 02:07:55,131
Lieutenant, we got a witness here,

1410
02:07:55,133 --> 02:07:57,802
says she saw someone coming down
the fire escape right after the shot.

1411
02:07:57,806 --> 02:08:00,267
She said he went into the corner diner.

1412
02:08:00,264 --> 02:08:03,124
The guy's sitting by himself
at the counter, right now.

1413
02:08:18,785 --> 02:08:20,871
Police! Hands up!

1414
02:08:23,829 --> 02:08:27,333
He said put your goddamn hands up, 
you son of a bitch.

1415
02:08:46,560 --> 02:08:48,577
I just ordered a slice of pumpkin pie.

1416
02:08:51,356 --> 02:08:52,649
Stay still!

1417
02:08:52,649 --> 02:08:53,650
Now!

1418
02:09:22,262 --> 02:09:24,055
Which one is you?

1419
02:09:24,306 --> 02:09:25,807
You tell me.

1420
02:09:26,558 --> 02:09:28,018
Let's go, pencil-neck.

1421
02:09:31,233 --> 02:09:32,984
Get that son of a bitch out of here!

1422
02:09:47,405 --> 02:09:51,125
...where even murdered mayor Don Mitchell, 
Jr.'s wife and son have gathered

1423
02:09:51,126 --> 02:09:53,250
in an emotional show of city unity.

1424
02:09:53,252 --> 02:09:55,838
Our Dan O'Neil is live
inside Reál's headquarters right now...

1425
02:09:55,841 --> 02:09:56,883
Hey.

1426
02:10:21,276 --> 02:10:23,071
What are all these diaries?

1427
02:10:23,073 --> 02:10:25,618
They're ledgers. He's got thousands.

1428
02:10:25,620 --> 02:10:29,166
He scrawled all over 'em.
Rambling, ciphers, codes.

1429
02:10:29,168 --> 02:10:30,874
Got something back on one of the IDs.

1430
02:10:30,876 --> 02:10:33,331
Edward Nashton. Works at KTMJ.

1431
02:10:33,333 --> 02:10:35,168
- He's a forensic accountant.
- Accountant?

1432
02:10:35,172 --> 02:10:37,591
Hey, Lieutenant!
You really okay with this?

1433
02:10:37,588 --> 02:10:39,340
What about chain of evidence?

1434
02:10:40,260 --> 02:10:41,470
You should see this.

1435
02:10:47,434 --> 02:10:48,935
He's wearing gloves.

1436
02:10:50,395 --> 02:10:52,647
"Friday, July 16th.

1437
02:10:52,649 --> 02:10:56,419
"My life has been a cruel riddle
I could not solve,

1438

1439
02:10:59,810 --> 02:11:01,403
"But then, today, I saw it.

02:11:13,165 --> 02:11:16,458
"One look inside, and finally I understood.

1444
02:11:16,463 --> 02:11:19,800
"My whole life has been 
preparing me for this.

1445
02:11:19,796 --> 02:11:22,425
"The moment when I would learn the truth.

1446
02:11:22,427 --> 02:11:26,114
"When I could finally strike back
and expose their lies.

1447
02:11:26,386 --> 02:11:30,310
"If you want people to understand,
really understand,

1448
02:11:30,299 --> 02:11:32,768
"you can't just give them the answers.

1449
02:11:32,771 --> 02:11:36,815
"You have to confront them, 
torture them with the horrifying questions,

1450
02:11:36,817 --> 02:11:39,067
"just like they tortured me.

1451
02:11:39,069 --> 02:11:41,863
"I know now what I must become."

1452
02:11:44,825 --> 02:11:46,159
Jesus.

1453
02:11:52,249 --> 02:11:54,209
I don't think that rat likes you, man.

1454
02:11:54,751 --> 02:11:56,253
This one's not a rat.

1455
02:12:12,894 --> 02:12:14,020
What is that?

1456
02:12:45,630 --> 02:12:46,840
Some kind of pry tool?

1457
02:12:46,842 --> 02:12:48,219
Is it a chisel?

1458
02:12:48,218 --> 02:12:49,678
It's a murder weapon.

1459
02:12:49,678 --> 02:12:51,463
He killed Mitchell with it.

1460
02:12:51,805 --> 02:12:54,683
The edge will match the floorboard
impression in the mayor's study.

1461
02:13:03,317 --> 02:13:05,483
"My confession"?

1462
02:13:05,485 --> 02:13:08,363
What's he confessing to?
He already told us he killed Mitchell.

1463
02:13:08,572 --> 02:13:09,948
This isn't over.

1464
02:13:09,951 --> 02:13:12,370
Oh, man. He's been posting
all kinds of shit online.

1465
02:13:12,743 --> 02:13:14,953
He's got, like, 500 followers.
Real fringe types.

1466
02:13:22,419 --> 02:13:24,659
His final post was last night.

1467
02:13:25,005 --> 02:13:28,798
Some video. Got a lot of views,
but it's password-protected.

1468
02:13:28,800 --> 02:13:30,310
Can you get in?

1469
02:13:30,311 --> 02:13:35,227
Copying his drive now.
Take some time, but we'll get in.

1470
02:13:46,571 --> 02:13:49,116
- Show me the post.
- It's right here.

1471
02:13:50,742 --> 02:13:52,452
"The Truth Unmasked".

1472
02:13:53,242 --> 02:13:54,869
I think I'm his last target.

1473
02:13:57,329 --> 02:13:58,497
You?

1474
02:13:58,956 --> 02:14:00,999
Maybe this is all coming to an end.

1475
02:14:01,416 --> 02:14:02,792
What is?

1476
02:14:03,293 --> 02:14:04,711
The Batman.

1477
02:14:10,008 --> 02:14:11,176
Yeah?

1478
02:14:22,437 --> 02:14:23,647
Right.

1479
02:14:26,608 --> 02:14:30,570
Riddler's asking for you. At Arkham.

1480
02:14:38,165 --> 02:14:39,666
You're a good cop.

1481
02:15:04,104 --> 02:15:06,481
I told you I'd see you in hell.

1482
02:15:07,212 --> 02:15:09,191
What do you want from me?

1483
02:15:09,193 --> 02:15:10,736
"Want"?

1484
02:15:11,448 --> 02:15:15,077
If only you knew how long
I've been waiting for this day.

1485
02:15:16,215 --> 02:15:17,550
For this moment.

1486
02:15:18,535 --> 02:15:21,538
I've been invisible my whole life.

1487
02:15:22,688 --> 02:15:25,315
I guess I won't be anymore, will I?

1488
02:15:26,752 --> 02:15:29,336
They'll remember me now.

1489
02:15:29,338 --> 02:15:31,173
They'll remember both of us.

1490
02:15:41,391 --> 02:15:43,351
Bruce...

1491
02:15:46,396 --> 02:15:48,231
Wayne.

1492
02:15:50,526 --> 02:15:54,280
Bruce...

1493
02:15:55,867 --> 02:15:58,745
Wayne.

1494
02:16:09,837 --> 02:16:12,257
You know, I was there that day.

1495
02:16:14,842 --> 02:16:18,471
The day the great Thomas Wayne
announced he was running for mayor,

1496
02:16:18,473 --> 02:16:20,851
made all those promises.

1497
02:16:23,248 --> 02:16:27,500
Well, a week later he was dead,
and everybody just forgot about us.

1498
02:16:27,980 --> 02:16:31,735
All they could talk about
was poor Bruce Wayne.

1499
02:16:31,737 --> 02:16:35,086
Bruce Wayne, the orphan.

1500
02:16:35,821 --> 02:16:37,364
Orphan.

1501
02:16:43,120 --> 02:16:48,250
Living in some tower over the park
isn't being an orphan.

1502
02:16:49,543 --> 02:16:54,713
Looking down on everyone,
with all that money.

1503
02:16:54,715 --> 02:16:56,259
Don't you tell me.

1504
02:16:58,956 --> 02:17:01,626
Do you know what being an orphan is?

1505
02:17:02,055 --> 02:17:04,360
It's 30 kids to a room.

1506
02:17:05,893 --> 02:17:09,939
Twelve years old and already a drophead,
numbing the pain.

1507
02:17:11,565 --> 02:17:16,236
You wake up screaming
with rats chewing your fingers.

1508
02:17:17,487 --> 02:17:22,992
And every winter one of the babies die
because it's so cold.

1509
02:17:24,362 --> 02:17:26,948
But, oh, no.

1510
02:17:29,875 --> 02:17:33,213
Let's talk about the billionaire
with the lying, dead daddy

1511
02:17:33,215 --> 02:17:37,188
because at least the money
makes it go down easy. Doesn't it?

1512
02:17:38,592 --> 02:17:40,636
Bruce...

1513
02:17:41,678 --> 02:17:43,596
Wayne.

1514
02:17:47,226 --> 02:17:50,322
He's the only one we didn't get.

1515
02:17:53,732 --> 02:17:56,360
But we got the rest of 'em, didn't we?

1516
02:17:58,354 --> 02:18:01,818
All those slick, sleazy, phony pricks.

1517
02:18:05,244 --> 02:18:06,404
God.

1518
02:18:07,371 --> 02:18:08,664
Look at you.

1519
02:18:10,703 --> 02:18:15,537
Your mask is amazing.
I wish you could've seen me in mine.

1520
02:18:16,079 --> 02:18:17,340
Ain't it funny?

1521
02:18:17,342 --> 02:18:21,763
All everyone wants to do is unmask you,
but they're missing the point.

1522
02:18:23,136 --> 02:18:28,763
You and I both know
I'm looking at the real you right now.

1523
02:18:28,767 --> 02:18:32,396
My mask allowed me
to be myself completely.

1524
02:18:32,396 --> 02:18:33,939
No shame,

1525
02:18:34,857 --> 02:18:36,067
no limits.

1526
02:18:36,069 --> 02:18:37,738
Why did you write me?

1527
02:18:38,695 --> 02:18:39,696
What do you mean?

1528
02:18:39,698 --> 02:18:41,224
All those cards.

1529
02:18:41,238 --> 02:18:43,113
I told you,

1530
02:18:43,115 --> 02:18:45,410
we've been doing this together.
You're a part of this.

1531
02:18:45,412 --> 02:18:47,704
- We didn't do anything together.
- We did.

1532
02:18:47,706 --> 02:18:49,328
What did we just do?

1533
02:18:49,330 --> 02:18:52,502
I asked you to bring him into the light,
and you did. We're such a good team.

1534
02:18:52,499 --> 02:18:53,508
We're not a team.

1535
02:18:53,500 --> 02:18:56,137
I never could have
gotten him out of there.

1536
02:18:56,139 --> 02:18:58,757
I'm not physical. My strength is up here.

1537
02:18:58,759 --> 02:19:01,928
I mean, I had all the pieces,
I had the answers.

1538
02:19:01,930 --> 02:19:04,931
But I didn't know how to make them listen.
You gave me that.

1539
02:19:04,928 --> 02:19:06,222
I gave you nothing.

1540
02:19:06,224 --> 02:19:08,597
You showed me what was possible.

1541
02:19:08,599 --> 02:19:13,855
You showed me all it takes is fear
and a little focused violence.

1542
02:19:13,857 --> 02:19:15,400
You inspired me.

1543
02:19:15,397 --> 02:19:16,907
You're out of your goddamn mind.

1544
02:19:18,192 --> 02:19:18,857
What?

1545
02:19:18,850 --> 02:19:21,610
This is all in your head.
You're sick, twisted.

1546
02:19:21,612 --> 02:19:22,989
How can you say that?

1547
02:19:22,991 --> 02:19:24,493
You think you'll be remembered?

1548
02:19:24,498 --> 02:19:26,742
You're a pathetic psychopath,

1549
02:19:26,745 --> 02:19:28,318
- begging for attention.
- No.

1550
02:19:28,335 --> 02:19:30,326
- You're gonna die alone in Arkham.
- No.

1551
02:19:30,332 --> 02:19:31,374
No, no!

1552
02:19:31,371 --> 02:19:32,498
A nobody!

1553
02:19:34,169 --> 02:19:35,962
No!

1554
02:19:40,509 --> 02:19:43,095
This is not how this was supposed to go!

1555
02:19:47,471 --> 02:19:50,295
I had it all planned out!

1556
02:19:51,266 --> 02:19:53,279
We were gonna be safe here.

1557
02:19:53,644 --> 02:19:56,939
We could watch the whole thing together.

1558
02:19:56,930 --> 02:19:58,148
Watch what?

1559
02:19:58,148 --> 02:19:59,908
Everything!

1560
02:20:08,242 --> 02:20:09,910
It was all there.

1561
02:20:11,995 --> 02:20:14,331
You mean, you didn't figure it out?

1562
02:20:18,710 --> 02:20:22,630
Oh, you're really not as smart
as I thought you were.

1563
02:20:24,633 --> 02:20:26,974
I guess I gave you too much credit.

1564
02:20:27,305 --> 02:20:28,557
What have you done?

1565
02:20:29,137 --> 02:20:34,017
What's black and blue and dead all over?

1566
02:20:36,982 --> 02:20:38,817
You.

1567
02:20:40,232 --> 02:20:42,462
If you think you can stop what's coming...

1568
02:20:43,819 --> 02:20:45,362
What have you done?

1569
02:20:46,905 --> 02:20:53,288
♪ Ave Maria ♪

1570
02:20:53,290 --> 02:20:55,167

♪ Gratia plena ♪

1572
02:20:58,992 --> 02:21:00,586

Hey!

1576
02:21:47,841 --> 02:21:49,134
What are you doing in here?

1577
02:22:07,110 --> 02:22:09,696
Hey, man, I don't think that
you should be touching that.

1578
02:22:16,245 --> 02:22:18,706
Boy, this guy's a real nutjob, huh?

1579
02:22:19,668 --> 02:22:22,421
Killing Mitchell 
with a friggin' carpet tool.

1580
02:22:27,005 --> 02:22:30,218
My uncle's a... He's an installer.

1581
02:22:30,220 --> 02:22:32,389
You know, it's a... Oh, you know.

1582
02:22:32,386 --> 02:22:34,638
It's a tucker.

1583
02:22:52,489 --> 02:22:53,581
Huh.

1584
02:23:08,589 --> 02:23:11,593
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?

1585
02:23:11,595 --> 02:23:13,096
What are you doing?

1586
02:23:43,498 --> 02:23:44,916
Hey, guys.

1587
02:23:45,269 --> 02:23:47,083
Uh, thanks for all the comments

1588
02:23:47,085 --> 02:23:50,715
and a special thanks to everyone
for the tips on detonators.

1589
02:23:50,717 --> 02:23:51,718
Detonators?

1590
02:23:51,720 --> 02:23:56,766
I just want to say this will be 
my last post for a little while, and, uh...

1591
02:23:58,847 --> 02:24:04,272
...what this community has meant to me
these weeks, these months,

1592
02:24:04,978 --> 02:24:07,397
let's just say none of us...

1593
02:24:09,191 --> 02:24:11,331
...is alone anymore. Okay?

1594
02:24:12,194 --> 02:24:13,518
Jesus.

1595
02:24:17,616 --> 02:24:20,202
Tomorrow's Election Day.

1596
02:24:22,788 --> 02:24:25,577
And Bella Reál will win.

1597
02:24:25,585 --> 02:24:28,213
She promised real change.

1598
02:24:28,851 --> 02:24:31,381
But we know the truth, don't we?

1599
02:24:31,383 --> 02:24:35,510
You've seen Gotham's true face now.
Together, we've unmasked it.

1600
02:24:35,512 --> 02:24:42,468
Its corruption, its perversion
masquerading under the guise of renewal.

1601
02:24:42,477 --> 02:24:46,314
But unmasking is not enough.

1602
02:24:48,438 --> 02:24:52,442
The day of judgment is finally upon us.

1603
02:24:52,442 --> 02:24:55,163
And now it is time...

1604
02:24:55,946 --> 02:24:57,848
...for retribution.

1605
02:24:58,407 --> 02:25:04,444
I've parked seven vans
all along the city seawall.

1606
02:25:05,038 --> 02:25:07,125
And on the big night,

1607
02:25:07,127 --> 02:25:09,379
they will go boom.

1608
02:25:33,775 --> 02:25:36,512
When the vans blow,

1609
02:25:36,528 --> 02:25:41,908
the flooding will happen so fast,
evacuation will not be an option.

1610
02:25:42,451 --> 02:25:48,275
Those who are not washed away
will race through the streets in terror.

1611
02:25:48,875 --> 02:25:49,876
Call Gordon.

1612
02:25:49,878 --> 02:25:51,759
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1613
02:25:53,408 --> 02:25:57,339
As breaking news hits higher ground 
in Gotham Square Garden,

1614
02:25:57,341 --> 02:26:00,298
celebrations will turn to panic,

1615
02:26:00,302 --> 02:26:05,141
as the venue becomes
the city's shelter of last resort.

1616
02:26:06,517 --> 02:26:10,521
And that's where all of you come in.

1617
02:26:16,652 --> 02:26:20,407
Now, when the time arrives,
I will already be unmasked.

1618
02:26:20,409 --> 02:26:24,786
The pigs will have me in their custody,
but that's okay.

1619
02:26:24,788 --> 02:26:29,220
Because then it will be your turn.

1620
02:26:29,239 --> 02:26:32,777
You'll be there, waiting.

1621
02:26:44,221 --> 02:26:47,308
It's time for the lies to finally end.

1622
02:26:47,310 --> 02:26:51,440
False promises of renewal?

1623
02:26:51,442 --> 02:26:52,526
Change?

1624
02:26:52,813 --> 02:26:56,901
We'll give them real, real change now.

1625
02:26:56,900 --> 02:27:02,365
We've spent our lives 
in this wretched place, suffering!

1626
02:27:02,367 --> 02:27:04,870
Wondering, "Why us?"

1627
02:27:04,867 --> 02:27:10,415
Now they will spend their last moments 
wondering, why them?

1628
02:27:10,417 --> 02:27:12,461
I can't get through! The lines are down.

1629
02:27:18,005 --> 02:27:20,174
Hey, hey, hey! Road's closed!

1630
02:27:20,749 --> 02:27:22,551
I'm just trying to get out of town, man!

1631
02:27:22,554 --> 02:27:25,432
Lady, we got bombs going off.
The whole city's flooding.

1632
02:27:25,429 --> 02:27:27,714
You're gonna have to go inside the Garden 
with everyone else.

1633
02:27:36,930 --> 02:27:38,206
Lieutenant, who's in charge?

1634
02:27:38,208 --> 02:27:40,167
I really don't know. We're just
trying to get a handle here, sir.

1635
02:27:40,169 --> 02:27:40,792
Right.

1636
02:27:40,802 --> 02:27:42,363
Hey, listen! Quiet!

1637
02:27:42,380 --> 02:27:43,632
We got an active situation.

1638
02:27:43,646 --> 02:27:45,032
We need to sweep the building
for explosives

1639
02:27:45,032 --> 02:27:46,871
and get the mayor-elect out of here, now. 
Where is she?

1640
02:27:46,872 --> 02:27:48,326
- I can take you there.
- Come!

1641
02:28:24,196 --> 02:28:25,782
- If we don't close the doors,
- MCU.

1642
02:28:25,784 --> 02:28:27,582
we're gonna have huge problems.
The water's already started to breach.

1643
02:28:27,584 --> 02:28:29,378
I thought this was a shelter 
of last resort.

1644
02:28:29,368 --> 02:28:31,785
Yeah, for a hurricane,
but not if the whole seawall comes down.

1645
02:28:31,787 --> 02:28:34,040
I am not gonna let
those people die out there.

1646
02:28:34,042 --> 02:28:36,378
All right. I'll go calm down the crowd
so we can get everyone in.

1647
02:28:36,375 --> 02:28:38,722
It's not safe for you here.
We need to get you out, Ms. Reál.

1648
02:28:38,724 --> 02:28:40,976
- I'm not going anywhere.
- We're under attack, ma'am.

1649
02:28:40,963 --> 02:28:43,049
Exactly! That's the problem with this city.

1650
02:28:43,051 --> 02:28:45,644
Everyone's afraid to stand up
and do the right thing, but I'm not.

1651
02:28:45,634 --> 02:28:47,246
- Excuse me.
- Ma'am...

1652
02:28:52,474 --> 02:28:55,936
Everyone, everyone,
if I could just get your attention.

1653
02:28:56,311 --> 02:28:58,605
Please! I just need your attention!

1654
02:29:14,541 --> 02:29:15,667
You're okay!

1655
02:30:46,586 --> 02:30:49,214
Hey! Hey! How do I get up there?

1656
02:30:49,216 --> 02:30:50,464
Follow me, sir.

1657
02:33:00,347 --> 02:33:02,100
No, no. It's okay.

1658
02:33:02,102 --> 02:33:03,145
It's okay.

1659
02:33:04,312 --> 02:33:05,548
It's okay.

1660
02:33:06,895 --> 02:33:09,022
It's done now. It's done.

1661
02:33:11,567 --> 02:33:12,902
It's over.

1662
02:34:09,002 --> 02:34:12,464
Hey! Hey, man, take it easy!

1663
02:34:13,128 --> 02:34:15,353
Take it easy. Easy.

1664
02:34:43,909 --> 02:34:45,035
Jesus.

1665
02:34:54,962 --> 02:34:56,630
Who the hell are you?

1666
02:35:00,801 --> 02:35:01,802
Me?

1667
02:35:05,013 --> 02:35:06,431
I'm Vengeance.

1668
02:38:38,894 --> 02:38:41,188
<i>Wednesday, November 6th.</i>

1669
02:38:44,316 --> 02:38:46,193
<i>The city is underwater.</i>

1670
02:38:48,698 --> 02:38:50,450
<i>The National Guard is coming.</i>

1671
02:38:52,574 --> 02:38:57,540
<i>Martial law is in effect, 
but the criminal element never sleeps.</i>

1672
02:39:00,404 --> 02:39:06,672
<i>Looting and lawlessness will be rampant
in the parts of the city no one can get to.</i>

1673
02:39:08,009 --> 02:39:11,721
<i>I can already see things will get worse
before they get better.</i>

1674
02:39:14,683 --> 02:39:17,811
<i>And some will seize the chance
to grab everything they can.</i>

1675
02:39:19,175 --> 02:39:20,519
We will rebuild.

1676
02:39:20,978 --> 02:39:22,613
But not just our city.

1677
02:39:23,188 --> 02:39:27,652
We must rebuild people's faith
in our institutions,

1678
02:39:27,654 --> 02:39:29,740
in our elected officials,

1679
02:39:29,736 --> 02:39:31,136
in each other.

1680
02:39:31,780 --> 02:39:35,117
Together, we will learn
to believe in Gotham again.

1681
02:39:39,371 --> 02:39:41,214
<i>I'm starting to see now.</i>

1682
02:39:42,541 --> 02:39:44,710
<i>I have had an effect here...</i>

1683
02:39:46,795 --> 02:39:48,714
<i>but not the one I intended.</i>

1684
02:39:51,175 --> 02:39:54,220
<i>Vengeance won't change the past,</i>

1685
02:39:55,512 --> 02:39:57,890
<i>mine or anyone else's.</i>

1686
02:40:00,280 --> 02:40:02,324
<i>I have to become more.</i>

1687
02:40:05,355 --> 02:40:06,982
<i>People need hope.</i>

1688
02:40:08,358 --> 02:40:10,569
<i>To know someone's out there for them.</i>

1689
02:40:14,156 --> 02:40:15,825
<i>The city's angry,</i>

1690
02:40:16,783 --> 02:40:18,159
<i>scarred,</i>

1691
02:40:19,161 --> 02:40:20,412
<i>like me.</i>

1692
02:40:22,414 --> 02:40:24,500
<i>Our scars can destroy us.</i>

1693
02:40:26,035 --> 02:40:28,746
<i>Even after the physical wounds have healed.</i>

1694
02:40:30,380 --> 02:40:32,132
<i>But if we survive them,</i>

1695
02:40:33,592 --> 02:40:35,469
<i>they can transform us.</i>

1696
02:40:37,304 --> 02:40:41,599
<i>They can give us the power to endure...</i>

1697
02:40:43,185 --> 02:40:45,312
<i>...and the strength to fight.</i>

1698
02:40:48,232 --> 02:40:49,457
We are live.

1699
02:40:49,458 --> 02:40:53,197
As you can see, the masked vigilante 
atop Gotham Square Garden

1700
02:40:53,199 --> 02:40:56,701
helping to save the lives
of hundreds of victims.

1701
02:40:56,698 --> 02:40:59,950
And now as first responders desperately
scramble to help the injured,

1702
02:40:59,952 --> 02:41:02,497
a mysterious masked man emerges,

1703
02:41:02,499 --> 02:41:04,835
heroically pulling the victims
right through that skylight...

1704
02:41:04,831 --> 02:41:07,292
Isn't that just terrible?

1705
02:41:08,669 --> 02:41:13,465
Him... raining on your parade like that?

1706
02:41:19,221 --> 02:41:21,223
What is it they say?

1707
02:41:22,307 --> 02:41:24,476
"One day you're on top,

1708
02:41:26,144 --> 02:41:27,812
"the next...

1709
02:41:29,189 --> 02:41:31,107
"you're a clown."

1710
02:41:33,572 --> 02:41:34,740
Well,

1711
02:41:36,439 --> 02:41:39,275
let me tell you, 
there are worse things to be.

1712
02:41:41,663 --> 02:41:44,332
Hey, hey, hey. Don't be sad.

1713
02:41:45,625 --> 02:41:47,461
You did so well.

1714
02:41:51,837 --> 02:41:52,941
And you know,

1715
02:41:54,506 --> 02:41:57,718
Gotham loves a comeback story.

1716
02:42:07,728 --> 02:42:09,104
Who are you?

1717
02:42:09,605 --> 02:42:12,024
Well, that's the question,

1718
02:42:13,358 --> 02:42:14,525
isn't it?

1719
02:42:17,487 --> 02:42:19,864
Riddle me this...

1720
02:42:22,326 --> 02:42:24,453
"The less of them you have,

1721
02:42:25,120 --> 02:42:28,957
"the more one is worth."

1722
02:42:34,338 --> 02:42:36,090
A friend.

1723
02:43:02,536 --> 02:43:03,537
You're leaving.

1724
02:43:04,284 --> 02:43:05,369
Jesus.

1725
02:43:07,204 --> 02:43:08,789
Don't you ever just say hello?

1726
02:43:13,836 --> 02:43:15,254
Where will you go?

1727
02:43:16,839 --> 02:43:19,258
I don't know. Upstate.

1728
02:43:19,719 --> 02:43:21,430
Bludhaven, maybe.

1729
02:43:22,305 --> 02:43:23,306
Why?

1730
02:43:24,516 --> 02:43:25,725
You asking me to stay?

1731
02:43:32,774 --> 02:43:34,901
You know this place
is never gonna change.

1732
02:43:35,232 --> 02:43:37,568
With Carmine gone,
it's only gonna get worse for you.

1733
02:43:37,893 --> 02:43:39,811
There's gonna be a power grab.

1734
02:43:41,196 --> 02:43:42,322
It'll be bloody.

1735
02:43:42,831 --> 02:43:44,041
I know.

1736
02:43:45,787 --> 02:43:46,953
But the city can change.

1737
02:43:46,955 --> 02:43:48,206
It won't.

1738
02:43:49,332 --> 02:43:50,333
I have to try.

1739
02:43:50,335 --> 02:43:52,339
It's gonna kill you eventually.
You know that.

1740
02:43:54,504 --> 02:43:55,630
Listen.

1741
02:43:58,049 --> 02:43:59,301
Why don't you come with me?

1742
02:44:00,132 --> 02:44:01,634
Get into some trouble.

1743
02:44:02,512 --> 02:44:06,016
Knock off some CEO hedge fund types.
It'll be fun.

1744
02:44:06,627 --> 02:44:08,254
The bat and the cat.

1745
02:44:09,766 --> 02:44:11,435
It's got a nice ring.

1746
02:44:24,698 --> 02:44:26,116
Who am I kidding?

1747
02:44:27,618 --> 02:44:29,745
You're already spoken for.

1748
02:44:41,718 --> 02:44:43,136
You should go.

1749
02:44:51,478 --> 02:44:52,479
Selina...

1750
02:44:56,396 --> 02:44:58,065
Take care of yourself.
