<i>( latch clanks )</i>

3
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:57,905
What are they doing
with the bodies?

4
00:03:57,988 --> 00:03:59,656
Get back to work.

5
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,367
No. I've been here
for weeks.

6
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:03,827
I'm not scrubbing
one more corpse

7
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:06,371
until you tell me
why I'm doing it.

8
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:08,457
You will know why.

9
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:12,669
- When?
- When it's time,
not before.

10
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,171
Get back to work.

11
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,797
When do I get
to play the game?

12
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:17,341
Game?

13
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:20,010
The game.
The Game of Faces.

14
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:23,347
You tried already.
You failed.

15
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,890
I didn't even know
I was playing.

16
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:27,392
Who are you?

17
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:28,936
No one.

18
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,563
Get back to work.

19
00:04:31,647 --> 00:04:32,940
Who are you?

20
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:36,235
What are you doing here?
How did you get here?

21
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:40,822
I'm from Westeros
just like you.

22
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,452
Daughter of a lord
just like you.

23
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,371
Except I was
an only child.

24
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:50,666
Heir to his fortune.

25
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:53,168
My mother died.

26
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,545
My father remarried
and his new wife

27
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:58,382
gave birth to a girl.

28
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:02,886
My stepmother
didn't want any rivals
for her precious daughter,

29
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,138
so she tried
to kill me with poison.

30
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:07,182
I found out.

31
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,559
Sought help from
the Faceless Men.

32
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,481
And my father
was widowed again.

33
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,527
I've been serving them
ever since.

34
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:33,000
Was that true
or a lie?

35
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:37,087
What?

36
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,089
Did you believe
every word I said?

37
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,842
<i>( footsteps approaching )</i>

38
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,387

39
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:02,070
Jaqen:
<i>Who are you?</i>

40
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:13,623
Who are you?

41
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:20,088
Arya.

42
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,467
And where did you
come from?

43
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,885
<i>Westeros.</i>

44
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:30,974
My family home
is Winterfell.

45
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:33,727
I'm the youngest daughter
of a great lord,

46
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:34,895
Eddard Stark.

47
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:36,521
He died in battle.

48
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,066
A lie.

49
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:42,277
After he was executed,
I fled the capital.

50
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,405
Had to kill a stable boy.

51
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:47,449
Drove my sword
through his back.

52
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:48,950
( gasps )

53
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:50,577
A lie.

54
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,329
I stabbed him
in the gut.

55
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:55,165
<i>I tried to find</i>
<i>my mother and brother,</i>

56
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,625
<i>but I never did.</i>

57
00:06:56,708 --> 00:07:00,170
<i>They were murdered</i>
<i>by Walder Frey.</i>

58
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,839
An outlaw kidnapped me,
a man called Polliver.

59
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,591
( winces )

60
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:08,011
A man called the Hound.
Sandor Clegane.

61
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:10,347
He tried to sell me,
but was wounded in a fight.

62
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,265
He begged me to kill him,
but I wouldn't.

63
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:14,476
I left him
in the mountains to die.

64
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,978
I wanted him to suffer.
I hated him.

65
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:20,607
I hated him.

66
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:25,070
That's not a lie!

67
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,989
A girl lies to me,

68
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:31,535
to the Many-Faced God,
to herself.

69
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,912
Does she truly
want to be no one?

70
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,997
Yes.

71
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:37,958
( whimpers )

72
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:43,964
I'm not playing
this stupid game anymore!

73
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:46,174
We never stop playing.

74
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:11,992
So, those villages
we were supposed to find?

75
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:14,077
We can't live on
berries and roots.

76
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:16,746
I can.

77
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,665
You're not hungry?

78
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,750
Of course
I'm hungry.

79
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:23,253
You're an awful
travelling companion,
do you know that?

80
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,589
Possibly the least
charming man I've ever met.

81
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,591
I'm not your travelling
companion.

82
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,760
We are travelling together
in each other's company,
therefore--

83
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,596
Do you ever shut up?

84
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,765
I sailed
from King's Landing
to Pentos in a crate

85
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,476
<i>without ever</i>
<i>saying a word.</i>

86
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,061
Why?

87
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:46,151
It never occurred to you
to ask why until now?

88
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,280
You never wondered
why Tyrion Lannister

89
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,991
decided to visit
a brothel in Volantis?

90
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:56,161
I'm sure you
visited many brothels
in many cities.

91
00:08:58,413 --> 00:08:59,956
I killed my father.

92
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,879
He wanted to execute me
for a crime I didn't commit.

93
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,759
And he was fucking
the woman I loved.

94
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:22,812
As miserable
as you are, Mormont,

95
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,481
at least your father
was a good man.

96
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,316
What do you know
about my father?

97
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,861
I met him.
I visited the Wall.

98
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:32,906
When I asked him
about his men,

99
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,200
he knew all their stories,
every one of them.

100
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:38,828
He actually cared
about the people
under his command.

101
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:42,123
How do they put it
in the Watch?

102
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:44,960
"We shall never see
his like again."

103
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:58,139
Oh, you didn't know.

104
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:06,523
I'm sorry.
I am.

105
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,360
How?

106
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,863
I only know
what I heard.

107
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,240
How?

108
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,534
<i>He was leading</i>
<i>an expedition beyond</i>
<i>the Wall.</i>

109
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,079
There was a mutiny.

110
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:23,456
He was murdered
by his own men.

111
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:37,345
We better keep moving.

112
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:56,031
<i>( girl coughing )</i>

113
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:15,050

114
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,438
Valar morghulis.

115
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,482
Valar dohaeris.

116
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:34,069
I have nowhere
else to go.

117
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:37,864
I've taken her
to every healer
in Braavos.

118
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,950
I've spent
every penny I had.

119
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:46,122
( labored breathing )

120
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:49,084
She suffers every day
of her life.

121
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:52,087
I just want it to end.

122
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:21,825
It hurts.

123
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:24,119
I know.

124
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:28,790
Don't be afraid.

125
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:32,210
I used to be like you.

126
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,295
I was sick.

127
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,590
I was dying.

128
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:44,139
But my father
never gave up on me.

129
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:49,227
He loved me

130
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,020
more than anything
in the world,

131
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,815
just like your father
loves you.

132
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:56,860
So he brought me here.

133
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:59,737
My father prayed
to the Many-Faced God.

134
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,992
And I drank the water
from his fountain.

135
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,120
It healed me.

136
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,168
<i>( bowl scrapes )</i>

137
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:22,343
I've devoted my life
to him now.

138
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,889
You don't want
to hurt anymore?

139
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:29,809
Drink.

140
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:16,100
Jaqen:
<i>Is a girl ready?</i>

141
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:20,647
To give up her ears,
her nose, her tongue?

142
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:25,068
<i>Her hopes and dreams,</i>
<i>her loves and hates?</i>

143
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:27,945
All that makes a girl
who she is?

144
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,199
Forever?

145
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:36,704
No.

146
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:39,916
A girl is not ready
to become no one.

147
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:48,091
But she is ready
to become someone else.

148
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:04,399
Why Daenerys?
Why is she worth
all this?

149
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:09,278
As I recall,
the Mormonts fought
against the Targaryens

150
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,280
during Robert's
Rebellion.

151
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:13,449
Do you believe
in anything?

152
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:14,909
I believe
in lots of things.

153
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,078
In something greater
than ourselves, I mean.

154
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,122
The gods, destiny.

155
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:22,583
Do you believe there's
a plan for this world?

156
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:24,961
No.

157
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,170
Neither did I.

158
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:28,589
I was a cynic
just like you.

159
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:31,551
Then I saw a girl
step into a great fire

160
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:33,469
with three stone eggs.

161
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:36,639
When the fire burned out,
I thought I'd find her
blackened bones.

162
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:40,560
Instead, I saw her,
Daenerys,

163
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:44,731
alive and unhurt,
holding her baby dragons.

164
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,986
Have you ever heard
baby dragons singing?

165
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,487
No.

166
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:54,115
It's hard to be
a cynic after that.

167
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,327
Doesn't mean she's going
to be a great queen.

168
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,121
<i>No, it doesn't.</i>

169
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,498
The Targaryens
are famously insane.

170
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:05,334
What if she
conquers the world?
Then what?

171
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,670
1,000 years of peace
and prosperity?

172
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,964
First we have
to conquer the world.

173
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,507
We?

174
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:13,760
All right, let's assume
your dreams come true.

175
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:17,346
<i>She's ecstatic when you</i>
<i>bring her this enemy dwarf.</i>

176
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,433
<i>She hacks off my head</i>
<i>and restores your position.</i>

177
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,560
You command her army,
sail to Westeros,

178
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:25,855
defeat all your enemies
and watch her climb
those steps

179
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,315
and sit on
the Iron Throne.

180
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:29,734
Hurrah.
Long live the queen.
Then what?

181
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,319
Then she rules.

182
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:34,405
So a woman who has not
spent a single day
of her adult life

183
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:37,116
in Westeros becomes
the ruler of Westeros?
That's justice?

184
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,410
- She's the rightful heir.
- Why?

185
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:43,664
Because her father,
who burned living men
for amusement, was the king?

186
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:49,253
- That's a slave ship.
- Why are they anchored?

187
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:51,130
They probably
came ashore for--

188
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:53,674
-<i> ( swords scraping )</i>
- Man:<i> Water.</i>

189
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,185
- ( grunts )
- ( man laughs )

190
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:07,021
Got a lot of fight
in you, huh?

191
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:09,524
( grunts )

192
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:11,943
( chuckles )

193
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,323
Salt mines?

194
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:20,785
Yeah, that
or a galley slave.

195
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,620
<i>He looks strong enough.</i>

196
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:25,414
What about the dwarf?

197
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:27,750
Worthless.

198
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:30,253
Cut his throat.

199
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,505
Wait. Wait.
Wait, wait, wait!
Let's discuss this.

200
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,757
And then chop off
his cock.

201
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:36,175
We'll sell it
for a fortune.

202
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:38,427
A dwarf's cock
has magic powers.

203
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:40,763
Wait! Wait!

204
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:42,139
Wait, wait, wait!

205
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:44,725
You can't just hand
a dry cock to a merchant

206
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:46,352
and expect him
to pay for it.

207
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,104
He has to know
it came from a dwarf.

208
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:51,607
And how could he know
unless he sees the dwarf?

209
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,568
It will be
a dwarf-sized cock.

210
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:55,444
Guess again.

211
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:03,452
The dwarf lives
until we find
a cock merchant.

212
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,663
( exhales )

213
00:20:12,003 --> 00:20:14,380
Queen Daenerys
has outlawed slavery.

214
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,633
We're bound for Volantis,
not Slaver's Bay.

215
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:21,137
Besides, she reopened
the fighting pits.

216
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,973
I've never heard of free men
fighting in the pits.

217
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,392
Tyrion:
<i>The fighting pits</i>
<i>in Meereen?</i>

218
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:29,270
You're in luck, then.
You're about to be rich.

219
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:33,441
You are looking at one
of the great warriors
in the Seven Kingdoms.

220
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:35,109
( laughs )

221
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:36,736
Him.

222
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:40,615
Him?
He's got to be
60 years old.

223
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:43,326
Sure, he's a bit
long in the tooth,

224
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:45,870
a bit withered,
been in the sun too long.

225
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:49,665
We can all see that.
But he is a veteran
of 100 battles.

226
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:51,959
They wrote songs
about him.

227
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,926
That true?

228
00:21:05,348 --> 00:21:07,975
He won the tournament
at Lannisport.

229
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:10,770
Unseating Ser Jaime
Lannister himself.

230
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:15,107
- ( laughs )
- The Kingslayer.

231
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:18,444
Jousting.
You're talking
about jousting.

232
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,863
A fancy game
for fancy lads.

233
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:23,699
The men who fight
in the pits of Meereen
will swallow him whole.

234
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:26,535
I killed
a Dothraki bloodrider
in single combat.

235
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:38,589
Liar.

236
00:21:38,673 --> 00:21:41,384
It's no lie.
His name was Qotho.

237
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:44,303
He was bloodrider
to Khal Drogo.

238
00:21:44,387 --> 00:21:48,391
Take me to Slaver's Bay,
put a sword in my hand,

239
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:49,976
I'll prove my worth.

240
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:58,734
( laughing )

241
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:01,737
-<i> ( seagulls screeching )</i>
-<i> ( bell ringing )</i>

242
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:04,865
For my children.
Money.

243
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:10,705
Lord Baelish.

244
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:12,707
Yes?

245
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:16,127
Lancel Lannister.

246
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:20,214
Brother Lancel.

247
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:21,841
We abandon
our family names.

248
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:23,718
Quite a family
to abandon.

249
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:26,762
The city has changed
since you were here last.

250
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:28,806
We flooded the gutters
with wine,

251
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:31,392
smashed the false idols,

252
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:33,936
and set the godless
on the run.

253
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,396
Well done.

254
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:44,113
I'm here
on urgent business
for the Queen Mother.

255
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:47,074
Should I send word
that I'll be delayed?

256
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:52,496
Step carefully,
Lord Baelish.

257
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:55,041
You'll find there's little
tolerance for flesh peddlers

258
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:56,459
in the new King's Landing.

259
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:59,378
We both peddle fantasies,
Brother Lancel.

260
00:22:59,462 --> 00:23:01,964
Mine just happen
to be entertaining.

261
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:14,685
Do you think it's wise,
Your Grace,

262
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:16,395
arresting the heir
to Highgarden?

263
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:19,231
The Faith arrested
the heir to Highgarden.

264
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:22,526
Of course,
and the Faith were
armed on your orders.

265
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:24,153
The king's orders.

266
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:26,322
Is the king to blame
for Ser Loras's perversion?

267
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,324
House Tyrell
won't tolerate
this insult.

268
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:31,410
House Tyrell
won't tolerate it?

269
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:33,537
I'm the insulted party,
Lord Baelish.

270
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:35,289
Ser Loras
was promised to me.

271
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:37,249
Instead he chose
the company of boys.

272
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:39,752
One's choice of companion
is a curious thing.

273
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,006
Most curious.

274
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:48,427
Lysa Arryn,
for instance.

275
00:23:48,511 --> 00:23:50,387
Thoroughly
repellant woman.

276
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,808
Forgive me.

277
00:23:53,891 --> 00:23:55,726
I know you're still
in mourning.

278
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:59,105
Lysa was a good woman.

279
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:00,606
A kind woman.

280
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:03,567
<i>She was neither</i>
<i>of those things.</i>
<i>We both know it.</i>

281
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:05,569
Still, I pity her son.

282
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:07,780
How fortunate
the young Lord
of the Vale

283
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:10,157
<i>has a new father</i>
<i>to counsel him.</i>

284
00:24:10,241 --> 00:24:12,243
I know how hard
it can be

285
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:14,620
to lose
both your parents
at such a young age.

286
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:18,916
If war comes to Westeros,
will the Knights of the Vale
fight for their king?

287
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:22,545
Young Lord Robin
heeds my advice.

288
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:25,548
And I have always counseled
loyalty to the throne.

289
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:27,258
Good.

290
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,472
If there's
nothing else.

291
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,475
There is another matter,
Your Grace.

292
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,061
Something so urgent
I couldn't trust the words
to a raven.

293
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:42,064
You once charged me
with finding Arya Stark.

294
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:45,025
To my shame,
I failed you.

295
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:47,361
But I have found
Sansa Stark.

296
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:52,408
Alive and well
and home again

297
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:53,909
living at Winterfell.

298
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:56,203
That's not possible.

299
00:24:56,287 --> 00:24:58,497
My sources
are well placed.

300
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,542
They tell me Roose Bolton

301
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:04,211
plans to marry her
to his son Ramsay,

302
00:25:04,295 --> 00:25:06,797
a bastard recently
legitimized by King Tommen.

303
00:25:06,881 --> 00:25:10,676
Roose Bolton
is Warden of the North
by the grace of my father.

304
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:14,889
Indeed, his reward
for stabbing his own
king in the heart.

305
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,392
We were fools
to trust a turncloak.

306
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:20,811
Marrying his son
to the last of the Starks

307
00:25:20,895 --> 00:25:22,563
gives him more legitimacy
in the North

308
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:24,607
than an alliance with
a hated southern house.

309
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:27,943
I will skin him
and his bastard

310
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:30,029
like that wretch
on their bloody sigil.

311
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,906
I would
counsel patience,
Your Grace.

312
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:33,699
Patience?

313
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,284
Sansa helped
murder my son.

314
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,702
Roose Bolton
is a traitor.

315
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,787
Stannis Baratheon
is also a traitor,

316
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,539
marching with his army
on Winterfell.

317
00:25:40,623 --> 00:25:43,083
Let Stannis
and Roose battle.

318
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:45,419
Let the enemies
of the throne slaughter
each other.

319
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:49,173
And when they're done,
seize Winterfell from
whichever thief survives.

320
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:51,634
Winterfell is 1,000 miles
away from here.

321
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:53,844
The weather has already
begun to turn.

322
00:25:53,928 --> 00:25:56,597
That is why it is critical
to strike soon

323
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,225
while the victor
still licks his wounds.

324
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:03,145
Surely your Uncle Kevan
could muster a force.

325
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:06,732
My Uncle Kevan
has all the courage
of a kitchen mouse.

326
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,192
Ser Jaime, then.

327
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:10,945
<i>Jaime's away</i>
<i>on a sensitive</i>
<i>diplomatic mission.</i>

328
00:26:11,028 --> 00:26:13,697
I have no idea
when he'll be back.

329
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:16,075
<i>Perhaps I can help.</i>

330
00:26:16,158 --> 00:26:19,286
The Knights of the Vale
are some of the best
fighters in Westeros,

331
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:21,705
trained to battle
in the ice and the snow.

332
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:24,416
Forgive me,
Lord Baelish,

333
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,835
you have a reputation
as a moneylender

334
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:29,421
and a brothel keeper,
not a military man.

335
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:31,632
You wouldn't risk
a single Lannister soldier

336
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:35,052
or a single coin
from the royal treasury.

337
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:36,804
What do you have to lose?

338
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:38,681
A brothel keeper?

339
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:40,182
And if you succeed?

340
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:42,393
Name me
Warden of the North.

341
00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:50,150
I'll speak to the king
this evening,

342
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:52,236
have him issue
a royal decree.

343
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:55,364
I'll not rest
until the lion flies
over Winterfell.

344
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,533
And I'll know
you're a man of your word

345
00:26:57,616 --> 00:27:00,869
when I see Sansa Stark's
head on a spike.

346
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,955
As I said...

347
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,832
I live to serve.

348
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:13,507
I'm going
to ask him tomorrow.

349
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:16,760
- What if he says no?
- He won't.

350
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:19,221
We've waited
long enough.

351
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:21,682
I want you
to be my wife.

352
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,600
Now.

353
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,312
What is it?

354
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:29,606
Do you want to marry me
because our families
arranged it?

355
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:31,358
Or do you--

356
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:41,535
We can't.
Not yet.

357
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:42,661
Why not?

358
00:27:42,745 --> 00:27:44,747
You know why not.
Someone will see.

359
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,166
You are going
to be my wife.

360
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:50,919
I am going to be
your husband.

361
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:54,757
We're allowed
to walk through
the gardens together.

362
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,426
How many other girls
have you walked through
these gardens?

363
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:02,097
I like the way
your eyes go squinty
when you're jealous.

364
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:05,601
They do not go squinty
and you didn't answer
the question.

365
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:08,103
Doran:
They make
a lovely couple.

366
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:11,440
A Lannister
and a Martell.

367
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:14,818
<i>They have no idea</i>
<i>how dangerous that is.</i>

368
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:17,071
We must protect them.

369
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:19,031
Yes, my prince.

370
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:23,744
You haven't had to use
that axe of yours
in a long time.

371
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,122
I hope you remember how.

372
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:29,792
I remember how.

373
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:36,006
Bronn:
<i>♪ The Dornishman's wife</i>
<i>was as fair as the sun ♪</i>

374
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:41,178
♪ And her kisses
were warmer than spring ♪

375
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:43,180
♪ The Dornishman's
blade ♪

376
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:45,474
♪ It was made
of black steel ♪

377
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:49,937
♪ And its kiss
was a terrible thing ♪

378
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:54,108
♪ The Dornishman's wife
would sing as she bathed ♪

379
00:28:54,191 --> 00:28:58,278
- ♪ In a voice that
was sweet as a peach-- ♪
- All right, that's enough.

380
00:28:58,362 --> 00:29:00,364
I'm coming
to the best part.

381
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:02,116
We're trying
to blend in.

382
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:04,493
Don't want everyone
in Dorne to hear
your accent.

383
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,328
This song really is
all about the ending.

384
00:29:06,412 --> 00:29:08,622
It can wait.
There.

385
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:13,669
That's the Water Gardens.

386
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:16,505
Bronn:
<i>And once we've got</i>
<i>the princess, then what?</i>

387
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,841
( sighs )

388
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:21,593
I like to improvise.

389
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:23,971
That explains
the golden hand.

390
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:47,828
Ellaria:
Unbowed. Unbent.
Unbroken.

391
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:50,581
For Oberyn.

392
00:29:50,664 --> 00:29:52,416
All:
For Oberyn.

393
00:30:31,872 --> 00:30:34,208
Well, she's made
herself at home.

394
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:42,174
Myrcella.

395
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:46,720
Uncle Jaime?

396
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:48,514
I--

397
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:50,974
I don't understand.
What are you doing here?

398
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:52,893
Let's speak in private.

399
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:56,063
- I am Trystane Martell.
- Trystane is my intended.

400
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:58,982
Excellent.
Good to meet you.

401
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:00,776
We weren't expecting you,
Lord Jaime.

402
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:03,737
Why don't you let them
have some time alone, son?

403
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:10,410
Let's not do
something stupid.

404
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:14,831
( grunts )

405
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:16,625
- ( shrieks )
- That was something stupid.

406
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,168
We have to go,
Myrcella, now.

407
00:31:18,252 --> 00:31:20,546
- You hurt him!
- He'll be fine, I promise.

408
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:22,297
But we have to--

409
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:24,716
( grunts )

410
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:28,053
Oh, for fuck's sake.

411
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:30,389
( shouting )

412
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:32,140
( whip cracks )

413
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:11,138
Take her!

414
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,517
- You're coming with me.
- I don't want to.

415
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:17,561
I wasn't asking,
princess.

416
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:20,814
( screams )

417
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:27,154
- Ah!
- Drop your weapons!

418
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,706
Obara:
<i>I am Obara Sand.</i>

419
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:40,000
Daughter of Oberyn Martell.

420
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:43,462
I fight for Dorne.
Who do you fight for?

421
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:45,422
Drop your weapons.

422
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:06,777
When you were whole,
it would have been
a good fight.

423
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,531
<i>( sword clatters )</i>

424
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:19,331
You fight pretty good
for a little girl.

425
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:21,958
( shouting )

426
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:42,479
- ( horses neighing )
-<i> ( seagulls screeching )</i>

427
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:48,193
Halt!

428
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:54,282
Oh, you can smell the shit
from five miles away.

429
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:56,535
Well, why have we stopped?
Go on.

430
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:59,121
( horses neighing )

431
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:03,041
Rumors and gossip,
that's all they've got.

432
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:04,876
It's theater,
nothing more.

433
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,296
If they arrested
all the pillow biters
in King's Landing,

434
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:11,216
there'd be no room
left in the dungeons
for anyone else.

435
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:13,051
Everyone knew
about him and Renly.

436
00:34:13,135 --> 00:34:16,805
Renly Baratheon shagged
half the stable boys in
the Seven Kingdoms.

437
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,807
Everyone knew,
no one cared.

438
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,267
But he was
the king's brother.

439
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:22,227
And Loras
is the queen's brother.

440
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,479
No, no, no, no.
This is unacceptable.

441
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:26,690
- Cersei's behind it.
- Yeah, of course she is.

442
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:29,192
She wants
to drag our name
through the dirt,

443
00:34:29,276 --> 00:34:31,111
put us in our place.

444
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:33,155
Get some rest, dear.
You look appalling.

445
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:35,449
Let me deal
with Cersei Lannister.

446
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:37,117
( tapping )

447
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:45,000
Your Grace,
I have travelled
a long way.

448
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,419
You must be exhausted.

449
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:52,591
Put the pen down, dear.
We both know you're not
writing anything.

450
00:34:52,674 --> 00:34:55,886
Ah, yes.
The famously tart-tongued
Queen of Thorns.

451
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:58,972
And the famous tart
Queen Cersei.

452
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:04,352
I beg your pardon?

453
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:07,981
I know you're behind
this absurd incarceration
of my grandson.

454
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:10,650
If you apologize
for that comment,
perhaps I'll--

455
00:35:10,734 --> 00:35:13,737
You'll get your apology
when I get Loras.

456
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,823
I was as shocked
as anyone

457
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:19,534
when the Faith
arrested Ser Loras.

458
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:22,078
I have no love
for these fanatics,

459
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:25,665
but what can
a Queen Mother do?

460
00:35:25,749 --> 00:35:28,043
Has the crown
suddenly stopped needing

461
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:31,379
the troops,
gold, and wheat
my house supplies?

462
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:33,340
I can assure you,

463
00:35:33,423 --> 00:35:35,342
our alliance with
House Tyrell remains--

464
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:37,010
Do you expect
the alliance to continue

465
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:40,013
after you've thrown
our future into prison?

466
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:42,265
As I said,

467
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:44,684
I didn't imprison anyone.

468
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,186
As for your
veiled threats--

469
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:47,687
What veil?

470
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:49,689
( sighs )

471
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:54,194
The Lannister-Tyrell
alliance brought peace
to a war-torn country.

472
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:57,739
Do you really want to see
the Seven Kingdoms slide
back into warfare?

473
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:02,410
I didn't trust
your father.

474
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:05,122
<i>I didn't</i>
<i>particularly like him.</i>

475
00:36:05,205 --> 00:36:08,583
<i>But I respected him.</i>
<i>He was no fool.</i>

476
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:12,420
He understood
that sometimes we must
work with our rivals

477
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:13,922
rather than destroy them.

478
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,216
House Lannister
has no rival.

479
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:22,013
The High Septon has called
for an inquest, not a trial.

480
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:23,890
Just a small hearing
to determine

481
00:36:23,974 --> 00:36:26,810
whether the charges
against Loras have merit,

482
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:28,562
which I'm sure they don't.

483
00:36:28,645 --> 00:36:33,692
Loras will be freed,
our happy alliance
will continue...

484
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:37,028
and we'll forget
this unfortunate
conversation ever happened.

485
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:40,365
Good day, Lady Olenna.

486
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:59,426
<i>( door opens, closes )</i>

487
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:02,721
You are aware of the rumors
concerning you and Renly?

488
00:37:03,972 --> 00:37:06,182
I don't pay attention
to rumors.

489
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:09,477
<i>You were said</i>
<i>to be despondent</i>
<i>when he died.</i>

490
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:13,398
Witnesses state
that you refused
to leave his bedside

491
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:15,984
even as Stannis's army
closed in.

492
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:19,738
He was my friend.
He was my king.

493
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:22,324
Wasn't Joffrey your king?

494
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:25,160
<i>He was anointed</i>
<i>by the Seven, not Renly.</i>

495
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:30,874
I was wrong to support
Renly's claim, I know that.

496
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:33,543
But I was forgiven
by Joffrey.

497
00:37:33,627 --> 00:37:35,962
I fought for him
at the Battle
of Blackwater.

498
00:37:36,046 --> 00:37:39,633
Yes, wearing
Renly's armor.

499
00:37:39,716 --> 00:37:41,927
Why does it matter
what I wore?

500
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:44,846
Do you deny all
the charges against you?

501
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:46,932
Fornication.

502
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:49,059
<i>Buggery.</i>
<i>Blasphemy.</i>

503
00:37:49,142 --> 00:37:50,602
Of course I deny them.

504
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,854
You never lay
with Renly Baratheon?

505
00:37:52,938 --> 00:37:54,856
Never.

506
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,025
<i>Nor any other man?</i>

507
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,568
Never.

508
00:38:01,071 --> 00:38:03,573
That will be all,
Ser Loras.

509
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:13,458
Well, I think that's
quite enough of that.

510
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:16,211
The Faith calls
Queen Margaery forward.

511
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,129
You call me forward?

512
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:20,548
Yes, we have some
questions for you.

513
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:24,511
- I am the queen.
- You are.

514
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:27,138
And according
to the law of the Seven,

515
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:29,516
neither kings
nor queens are exempt

516
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,435
from testimony
at a holy inquest.

517
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:54,165
How do you
respond to these charges
against your brother?

518
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:55,750
They are lies.

519
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:57,502
- All of them?
- All of them.

520
00:38:57,585 --> 00:39:00,505
High Sparrow:
<i>Queen Margaery,</i>

521
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,173
<i>in the presence</i>
<i>of the gods,</i>

522
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:04,426
do you swear
that your brother
is innocent

523
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:06,428
of these charges
against him

524
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:08,054
to the best
of your knowledge?

525
00:39:08,138 --> 00:39:10,056
Yes, I swear it.

526
00:39:11,433 --> 00:39:13,560
Thank you,
Your Grace.

527
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:40,962
Do you know this man?

528
00:39:41,046 --> 00:39:44,340
Yes, very well.

529
00:39:44,424 --> 00:39:47,260
<i>He is Ser Loras Tyrell,</i>
<i>heir to Highgarden.</i>

530
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:49,971
How did you
come to meet?

531
00:39:50,055 --> 00:39:52,432
Olyvar:
<i>I squired for him.</i>

532
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:54,392
He took a liking to me.

533
00:39:54,476 --> 00:39:56,895
He summoned me
to his chamber
the first day we met.

534
00:39:58,563 --> 00:40:02,233
And what occurred
in his chamber?

535
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:06,863
We engaged
in intimate relations.

536
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:08,823
You lay with him?

537
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:10,325
That night
and many others.

538
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,786
Liar.
He's a liar.

539
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,289
Is there anyone else
who can support your claim?

540
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:18,500
Yes.

541
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:21,503
Yes, Queen Margaery.

542
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:24,923
<i>She walked in on us once</i>
<i>not long ago.</i>

543
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:27,425
She didn't seem
surprised.

544
00:40:27,509 --> 00:40:31,179
This testimony is an insult
to a great house.

545
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:34,641
Why should the Faith
or anyone else take
the word of a squire

546
00:40:34,724 --> 00:40:36,351
over the heir
to Highgarden?

547
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,478
Olyvar:
<i>He has a birthmark,</i>
<i>Your Grace.</i>

548
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:41,314
<i>Quite high on his thigh.</i>

549
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:44,526
Wine-colored and roughly
the shape of Dorne.

550
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:47,070
No! Liar!

551
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:48,696
( grunting )

552
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:52,534
What are you doing?
Let us pass.

553
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:55,328
The Faith is satisfied
there is enough evidence

554
00:40:55,412 --> 00:40:57,288
to bring a formal trial

555
00:40:57,372 --> 00:40:59,541
<i>for Ser Loras</i>

556
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:01,417
and Queen Margaery.

557
00:41:01,501 --> 00:41:02,710
What?

558
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:04,671
Bearing false witness
before the gods

559
00:41:04,754 --> 00:41:07,423
<i>is as grave a sin</i>
<i>as any, my lady.</i>

560
00:41:07,507 --> 00:41:09,175
Take her.

561
00:41:09,259 --> 00:41:12,011
Margaery:
<i>No. Tommen.</i>

562
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:14,722
Tommen!

563
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:17,100
You can't do this.
I am the queen.

564
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:19,686
Tommen!
Tommen!

565
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:22,230
<i>I am your queen.</i>
<i>How dare you?</i>

566
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:23,898
<i>Take your hands off me!</i>

567
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:26,484
<i>( shouting )</i>
<i>Tommen!</i>

568
00:41:39,873 --> 00:41:42,125
<i>( knocks on door )</i>

569
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:44,752
<i>( wind whistling )</i>

570
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:51,676
What do you want?

571
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:54,804
Lord Ramsay
sent me to draw you
a bath, my lady.

572
00:41:54,888 --> 00:41:57,432
You want to be
clean and fresh

573
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:59,392
for your new husband,
don't you?

574
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,703
You're so beautiful,

575
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:21,789
but you need
to keep him happy.

576
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:26,294
Ramsay gets
bored easily.

577
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,296
You don't want
to end up like--

578
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:32,967
well, like the others.

579
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:35,386
What others?

580
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:37,639
Myranda:
I shouldn't gossip.

581
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:40,308
Oh, it's good to see
the red again.

582
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:42,310
No point hiding anymore.

583
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:43,811
What others?

584
00:42:43,895 --> 00:42:46,481
Let's see,
there was Kyra

585
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,316
the blacksmith's
daughter.

586
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,985
She was tall like you,
lovely figure.

587
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:55,448
But she talked
and talked and talked

588
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:58,993
and Ramsay grew
tired of that.

589
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:01,371
Then there was Violet.

590
00:43:01,454 --> 00:43:04,123
She had gorgeous
blonde hair.

591
00:43:04,207 --> 00:43:07,001
But she got pregnant.

592
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:10,046
And, well,
that was boring.

593
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:13,675
Then Tansy.

594
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:15,385
Such a sweet girl.

595
00:43:15,468 --> 00:43:20,557
Of course, sweet girls
get a bit dull

596
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,517
after a while,
don't they?

597
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,144
Ramsay let me come
with him on that hunt.

598
00:43:25,228 --> 00:43:26,312
Hunt?

599
00:43:26,396 --> 00:43:28,022
Mmm.

600
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:34,445
Have you ever seen
a body after the dogs
have been at it?

601
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:36,322
Not so pretty.

602
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:41,369
But, well, it's your
wedding day.

603
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:43,955
Why am I talking
about such things?

604
00:43:46,416 --> 00:43:48,209
What was your name again?

605
00:43:48,293 --> 00:43:49,711
Myranda.

606
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:54,549
And how long have you
loved him, Myranda?

607
00:43:57,969 --> 00:44:01,180
Did you imagine
that he would be with you
forever, is that it?

608
00:44:01,264 --> 00:44:03,308
And I came along
and ruined it.

609
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:09,981
I'm Sansa Stark
of Winterfell.

610
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:14,360
This is my home
and you can't frighten me.

611
00:44:20,283 --> 00:44:22,994
Are you done with
your bath, my lady?

612
00:44:23,995 --> 00:44:25,913
Go. I can finish
on my own.

613
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:52,940
-<i> ( knocks on door )</i>
- Yes?

614
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:05,036
I've come to escort you
to the godswood, my lady.

615
00:45:09,624 --> 00:45:13,044
If you please, my lady,
will you take my arm?

616
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:15,463
No.

617
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:18,800
Lord Ramsay, he said
I'm to take your arm.

618
00:45:18,883 --> 00:45:20,259
I'm not touching you.

619
00:45:22,345 --> 00:45:24,180
Please.

620
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:26,099
He'll punish me.

621
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:30,645
You think I care
what he does to you?

622
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:50,683
Who comes before
the old gods this night?

623
00:46:52,018 --> 00:46:55,396
Theon:
Sansa of the House Stark

624
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:58,107
comes here
to be wed.

625
00:47:00,193 --> 00:47:04,071
A woman grown,
trueborn and noble.

626
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:08,493
She comes to beg
the blessings
of the gods.

627
00:47:10,411 --> 00:47:12,413
Who comes to claim her?

628
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:24,425
Ramsay of House Bolton.

629
00:47:24,509 --> 00:47:26,969
<i>Heir to the Dreadfort</i>
<i>and Winterfell.</i>

630
00:47:29,639 --> 00:47:31,891
Who gives her?

631
00:47:34,185 --> 00:47:39,398
Theon of House Greyjoy,
who was--

632
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:45,404
who was her father's ward.

633
00:47:47,615 --> 00:47:51,202
Lady Sansa,
will you take this man?

634
00:48:21,065 --> 00:48:22,775
I take this man.

635
00:48:54,307 --> 00:48:56,475
Are you pleased,
my lady?

636
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:02,231
Good. I want you
to be happy.

637
00:49:07,987 --> 00:49:09,655
( sighs )

638
00:49:12,408 --> 00:49:15,119
My father said
you're still a virgin.

639
00:49:20,833 --> 00:49:23,377
- Uh, yes.
- Why?

640
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:30,384
Why are you
still a virgin?

641
00:49:30,468 --> 00:49:32,637
Afraid of dwarves?
( chuckles )

642
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:36,349
Lord-- Lord Tyrion
was kind.

643
00:49:36,432 --> 00:49:39,852
He was gentle.
He never touched me.

644
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,980
You're not lying to me?

645
00:49:43,064 --> 00:49:44,607
No, my lord.

646
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:47,276
Lying to your husband
on his wedding night,

647
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:50,988
that would be a bad way
to start a marriage.

648
00:49:55,868 --> 00:49:59,080
We're man and wife now.

649
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:01,248
We should be honest
with each other.

650
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:02,958
Don't you think?

651
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:05,878
Yes.

652
00:50:16,055 --> 00:50:17,723
Good.

653
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:21,811
Take off your clothes.

654
00:50:25,815 --> 00:50:27,858
Oh, no, no, no.

655
00:50:27,942 --> 00:50:30,945
You stay here, Reek.

656
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:33,155
You watch.

657
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:48,212
Do I need to ask
a second time?

658
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:50,464
I hate asking
a second time.

659
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:19,744
Reek...

660
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:22,872
I told you to watch.

661
00:51:28,669 --> 00:51:31,714
You've known Sansa
since she was a girl.

662
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:34,800
Now watch her
become a woman.

663
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:44,101
( gasps )

664
