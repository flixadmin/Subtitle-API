1
00:00:01,594 --> 00:00:03,442
Oliver:
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,628 --> 00:00:05,677
After 5 years in Hell,
I returned home

3
00:00:05,678 --> 00:00:08,479
with only one goal--
to save my city.

4
00:00:08,481 --> 00:00:10,715
Today, I fight that war
on two fronts.

5
00:00:10,717 --> 00:00:13,150
By day, I lead Star City
as its mayor,

6
00:00:13,152 --> 00:00:15,252
but by night,
I am someone else.

7
00:00:15,254 --> 00:00:17,688
I am...Something else.

8
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:20,725
I am the Green Arrow.

9
00:00:20,727 --> 00:00:22,026
Previously on "Arrow"...

10
00:00:22,028 --> 00:00:23,461
You have to promise me

11
00:00:23,463 --> 00:00:25,062
that you will be
his father.

12
00:00:25,064 --> 00:00:26,697
I promise.

13
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:28,799
William blames me
for Samantha's death.

14
00:00:28,801 --> 00:00:30,901
Oliver: Now you don't
have to like me.

15
00:00:30,903 --> 00:00:33,504
I'm your dad. I am
gonna be there for you

16
00:00:33,506 --> 00:00:36,040
whether you want me
to be or not.

17
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,481
John: Curtis and Lance took Rene
to Dr. Schwartz for treatment.

18
00:00:43,483 --> 00:00:44,949
Saw you take the shot
at that merc.

19
00:00:44,951 --> 00:00:46,350
Never seen you miss.

20
00:00:46,352 --> 00:00:47,918
Turn on channel 52
right now.

21
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,488
Bethany Snow: This photo
provides unequivocal proof

22
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:54,391
of the identity of the vigilante
known as the Green Arrow.

23
00:00:54,393 --> 00:00:56,260
What are we gonna do?

24
00:00:56,262 --> 00:00:57,762
I--I don't know.

25
00:01:02,401 --> 00:01:04,969
Anything interesting
on the news last night?

26
00:01:04,971 --> 00:01:06,804
Reporter: Can you comment on the photo
released last night?

27
00:01:06,806 --> 00:01:08,239
Reporter two: How do you feel
about the accusation

28
00:01:08,241 --> 00:01:09,373
of being
the Green Arrow?

29
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:10,775
Oliver:
Ladies and gentlemen.

30
00:01:10,777 --> 00:01:12,409
Ladies and gentlemen,
please.

31
00:01:12,411 --> 00:01:13,744
If you want to know
what I have to say,

32
00:01:13,746 --> 00:01:16,881
it would probably help
if you could hear me.

33
00:01:16,883 --> 00:01:18,215
Thank you.

34
00:01:18,217 --> 00:01:19,517
Gonna tell you two things,

35
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:21,452
both of which you
probably already know.

36
00:01:21,454 --> 00:01:25,656
First. This is important.
I am not the Green Arrow.

37
00:01:25,658 --> 00:01:27,725
Reporter: If you're
not the Green Arrow, then who is?

38
00:01:27,727 --> 00:01:30,761
Number two. Photos
can be doctored.

39
00:01:30,763 --> 00:01:34,031
They could have put
Bruce Wayne's head on that body.

40
00:01:34,033 --> 00:01:37,301
Has Bruce Wayne left Gotham to
hang out in Star City recently?

41
00:01:37,303 --> 00:01:40,237
No. Now if I was running
around the city

42
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:43,073
during the day
and managing it as mayor

43
00:01:43,075 --> 00:01:45,543
while running around at night
frightening criminals

44
00:01:45,545 --> 00:01:47,578
as a vigilante,
that really would

45
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:50,815
make me a superhero,

46
00:01:50,817 --> 00:01:52,801
but I'm not.

47
00:01:52,802 --> 00:01:54,785
I'm just the mayor.

48
00:01:54,787 --> 00:01:56,153
Thank you very much.

49
00:01:56,155 --> 00:01:59,256
[Reporters clamoring]

50
00:01:59,258 --> 00:02:00,758
You seem to be
taking this in your stride.

51
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,693
I've been here before
with you.

52
00:02:02,695 --> 00:02:04,461
Ugh. Yeah, but I
didn't have a photograph

53
00:02:04,463 --> 00:02:06,497
of you in flagrante
de-arrow.

54
00:02:06,499 --> 00:02:08,432
Where did channel 52
get the photo?

55
00:02:08,434 --> 00:02:10,100
Anonymous source.
Arrived in yesterday's mail,

56
00:02:10,102 --> 00:02:11,802
no return address.

57
00:02:11,804 --> 00:02:13,270
Let's get the envelope,
let's get it to forensics,

58
00:02:13,272 --> 00:02:16,106
and let's figure out
who leaked it.

59
00:02:16,108 --> 00:02:18,108
And why.

60
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,244
Can't let this
distract us.

61
00:02:20,246 --> 00:02:22,580
Where are with rebuilding
the SCPD?

62
00:02:22,582 --> 00:02:24,510
Well, I fast tracked
the insurance claim,

63
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:25,951
so we should have
20 million burning  a hole

64
00:02:25,952 --> 00:02:27,484
in our account
by the end of the day.

65
00:02:27,486 --> 00:02:29,653
- "Our" account?
- I figure we peel off

66
00:02:29,655 --> 00:02:30,921
a few bucks and fly
off to Vegas.

67
00:02:30,923 --> 00:02:32,756
Heh heh heh.
That's cute.

68
00:02:32,758 --> 00:02:34,058
Think it might be
a little suspicious

69
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,292
if Oliver left town
right about now.

70
00:02:35,294 --> 00:02:36,460
I need to be in town

71
00:02:36,462 --> 00:02:39,463
for the Markovian
delegation.

72
00:02:39,465 --> 00:02:43,400
So it's all right for me to go to Vegas
is what you're saying?

73
00:02:47,073 --> 00:02:48,472
Oliver: Hello.

74
00:02:51,143 --> 00:02:52,676
I don't think you
have an appointment.

75
00:02:52,678 --> 00:02:55,379
No, but I really
don't need one.

76
00:02:55,381 --> 00:02:57,715
Special Agent
Samanda Watson.

77
00:02:57,717 --> 00:02:59,650
Quentin: Uh, can we help
you with something?

78
00:02:59,652 --> 00:03:02,119
Not really. I'm here
as a courtesy

79
00:03:02,121 --> 00:03:03,454
to inform you
of the investigation

80
00:03:03,456 --> 00:03:04,822
I'll be conducting
in your city.

81
00:03:04,824 --> 00:03:06,824
Investigation
into what?

82
00:03:06,826 --> 00:03:08,058
You.

83
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,560
Ohh. You've got to
be kidding.

84
00:03:09,562 --> 00:03:11,328
Yeah, because
the FBI is world renowned

85
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:14,465
for its sense
of humor.

86
00:03:14,467 --> 00:03:15,866
You were on the news
last night, wearing

87
00:03:15,868 --> 00:03:17,868
the outfit
of a known criminal.

88
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,536
Can you honestly
say you're surprised

89
00:03:19,538 --> 00:03:20,871
there's
an investigation?

90
00:03:20,873 --> 00:03:23,574
No, but I wasn't
expecting the FBI.

91
00:03:23,576 --> 00:03:25,009
Well, quite frankly,
the local

92
00:03:25,011 --> 00:03:27,211
law enforcement has
proven ineffective

93
00:03:27,213 --> 00:03:28,779
where the Green Arrow
is concerned.

94
00:03:28,781 --> 00:03:31,215
Uh, Agent...Watson?

95
00:03:31,217 --> 00:03:32,316
Yes.

96
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:34,852
I was cleared
5 years ago.

97
00:03:34,854 --> 00:03:38,155
Of being the Hood,
not the Green Arrow,

98
00:03:38,157 --> 00:03:40,858
and you were cleared by the guy
who's now your deputy mayor.

99
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,493
Would you like me
to send you a copy

100
00:03:42,495 --> 00:03:43,894
of the polygraph
that Mr. Queen passed?

101
00:03:43,896 --> 00:03:46,897
For starters.
The local AG will be

102
00:03:46,899 --> 00:03:49,667
issuing subpoenas
later on today.

103
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:51,869
It was nice meeting
you, gentlemen.

104
00:03:51,871 --> 00:03:54,271
I'm sure we'll be
seeing a lot more of each other.

105

At least they caught
his good side.

108
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,620
Sorry. Not funny.

109
00:04:09,622 --> 00:04:11,088
All right. John said
you guys have experience

110
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:12,690
putting this particular
genie back in the bottle.

111
00:04:12,692 --> 00:04:14,258
Well, yeah. I mean,
John's put on the hood before,

112
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,693
but I don't see
how that's gonna work now,

113
00:04:15,695 --> 00:04:16,961
not with
photographic evidence.

114
00:04:16,963 --> 00:04:18,329
What about
the human target?

115
00:04:18,331 --> 00:04:19,897
The human what now?

116
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:21,598
Best cosplayer ever.
He can literally

117
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,133
make himself look like
someone else?

118
00:04:23,135 --> 00:04:24,601
John: Yeah. Chance is
out of the country right now,

119
00:04:24,603 --> 00:04:26,103
only God knows where.

120
00:04:26,105 --> 00:04:27,571
We have to think of a new way of
getting out of this.

121
00:04:27,573 --> 00:04:29,239
And if we can't?

122
00:04:29,241 --> 00:04:30,975
Because assuming Oliver
does not go to prison,

123
00:04:30,977 --> 00:04:32,576
he's not gonna be
able to do anything

124
00:04:32,578 --> 00:04:33,944
with a million eyes
on him.

125
00:04:33,946 --> 00:04:36,280
Not to mention that
if he's outed,

126
00:04:36,282 --> 00:04:38,282
rather if he stays outed,

127
00:04:38,284 --> 00:04:40,517
it won't be much of a leap
to the rest of us.

128
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:42,252
One step at a time.

129
00:04:42,254 --> 00:04:43,754
Ok. First step being
figuring out

130
00:04:43,756 --> 00:04:45,289
where this picture
came from.

131
00:04:46,926 --> 00:04:48,993
It came from nowhere.

132
00:04:48,995 --> 00:04:50,394
What do you mean?

133
00:04:50,396 --> 00:04:51,762
I mean this envelope
wasn't mailed,

134
00:04:51,764 --> 00:04:53,330
delivered, or sent.

135
00:04:53,332 --> 00:04:55,299
It came from inside
the channel 52 news offices.

136
00:04:55,301 --> 00:04:56,533
How do we know that?

137
00:04:56,535 --> 00:04:58,602
Bar code.
Channel 52 uses it

138
00:04:58,604 --> 00:05:00,404
for internal traffic.

139
00:05:00,406 --> 00:05:01,705
How many people
work there?

140
00:05:01,707 --> 00:05:03,173
568.

141
00:05:03,175 --> 00:05:04,608
[Sighs]

142
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,010
All right. I'm just
gonna say to say it.

143
00:05:06,012 --> 00:05:07,411
What if this was
Chase, huh?

144
00:05:07,413 --> 00:05:08,812
He could have put this
in motion months ago,

145
00:05:08,814 --> 00:05:10,414
a little parting gift.

146
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:12,416
Seems like his style,
messing with you like this.

147
00:05:12,418 --> 00:05:14,752
It is more than
possible.

148
00:05:14,754 --> 00:05:16,720
How's your boy holding
up with all this?

149
00:05:16,722 --> 00:05:18,822
Ok. I wanted to
keep him home from school,

150
00:05:18,824 --> 00:05:20,391
but he insisted
on going.

151
00:05:20,393 --> 00:05:21,825
Like his father, huh?

152
00:05:21,827 --> 00:05:23,027
I wasn't much
of a student.

153
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:24,862
I mean, he's tough.

154
00:05:29,935 --> 00:05:32,302
Curtis: Where's he
standing?

155
00:05:32,304 --> 00:05:34,872
If we could figure
out when and where this was taken,

156
00:05:34,874 --> 00:05:36,206
it would give us
something to go on.

157
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:38,008
I wrote an image
analysis algorithm,

158
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,543
but there's just not
very much for the computer to chew on.

You're not exactly
a--a very trusting person,

475
00:19:18,851 --> 00:19:20,684
are you,
special Agent Watson?

476
00:19:20,686 --> 00:19:22,953
Trust isn't part
of my job description,

477
00:19:22,955 --> 00:19:26,123
but let me make one thing
clear as glass to you both.

478
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:29,994
If you're protecting
Mr. Queen, I'll find out,

479
00:19:29,996 --> 00:19:33,030
and I'll have you both
indicted for obstruction.

00:19:33,032 --> 00:19:35,165
Now get out my office.

481

You wasted enough
of my time.

Hey, William.

484
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:46,977
That was a gift
from a very good friend of mine.

485

It's all fake!

487
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:53,217
Buddy, I know that
I ran out on you, and I'm sorry,

488
00:19:53,219 --> 00:19:55,119
but people needed
help,

489
00:19:55,121 --> 00:19:57,154
and I know that you
needed help, too,

490
00:19:57,156 --> 00:19:59,390
so I am--I'm here.

491
00:19:59,392 --> 00:20:01,025
Do you want to learn
a few more moves, or--

492
00:20:01,027 --> 00:20:03,961
No, because I don't
want to learn how to fight.

493
00:20:03,963 --> 00:20:05,696
I don't want you to
learn how to fight,

reason with bullies.

You just left me
by myself.

I know. I know,
and I'm sorry.

497

I didn't know if you
were gonna come back.

498
00:20:16,909 --> 00:20:18,709
William, look at me.

499
00:20:18,711 --> 00:20:20,778
I will always come back.

This is different.

502
00:20:24,517 --> 00:20:25,716
Yeah. It's worse

503
00:20:25,718 --> 00:20:27,718
because there's
a million psychos

Then I'll be alone.

exactly how it feels.

It's sad,
it's scary,

Hello, Oliver.

Anatoly, why are
you doing this?

526
00:21:42,294 --> 00:21:43,394
I need money,

527

and from what
I understand,

528
00:21:45,197 --> 00:21:48,465
your city recently
came into possession of $20 million.

529
00:21:48,467 --> 00:21:50,467
There are plenty
of cities in Russia.

530
00:21:50,469 --> 00:21:54,004
Hmm. True.
Beautiful ones,

but, you see,
I have been exiled.

Apparently, Bratva
thinks I am too weak

533
00:21:59,178 --> 00:22:01,578
due to my
friendship with you,

534
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:04,648
so now I show
everyone

535
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:07,184
I am not weak,

536

and you and I
no longer friends.

537

I know sometimes
you--you need persuasion

00:22:12,124 --> 00:22:15,125
to do right thing,
so I--I help you.

What is that?

Felicity: If we can
analyze the facial rash,

we might be able to
diagnose the poison.

That's great. So all we have to do
is get it to him

before the poison
takes over his entire body.

What are you
doing here?

Felicity and Curtis are
working on locating Tarkov.

He has maybe
an hour left.

636
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:10,783
So why aren't you home
with William?

637
00:26:10,785 --> 00:26:12,484
Sorry if I hit a nerve.

638
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:17,823
When have you ever been
sorry about hitting a nerve?

639
00:26:17,825 --> 00:26:21,160
That's a fair point.

Speaking of William.

Yeah?

642

We received a person
of interest list from Agent Watson.

643
00:26:28,669 --> 00:26:30,402
She wants to
interrogate my son?

644
00:26:30,404 --> 00:26:33,339
He's an alibi and probably not
a very good liar.

645
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:37,443
Absolutely not. She's not going
anywhere near him.

00:26:37,445 --> 00:26:38,978
I don't think
that's up to you.

647
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,446
I'm gonna use everything
single thing in my power

648
00:26:40,448 --> 00:26:44,416
to keep him as far away
from this as possible.

this kid has been
through enough.

651
00:26:53,294 --> 00:26:59,164
All right. Um, Lance
told me about what happened at school.

652
00:27:01,669 --> 00:27:03,202
Kids are mean.

653
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:06,372
He's not worried
about bullies.

654
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:08,207
He's worried about me.

655
00:27:11,045 --> 00:27:14,313
He thinks I'm gonna
make him an orphan.

656
00:27:14,315 --> 00:27:16,148
- Damn.
-  told him--

657
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:18,817
I said, "that will
not happen.

658
00:27:18,819 --> 00:27:21,253
I will always
come back."

659
00:27:25,893 --> 00:27:28,761
I have never lied
to my kid before.

660
00:27:34,335 --> 00:27:39,004
You know...I'm not
exactly father of the year,

661
00:27:39,006 --> 00:27:43,242

I remember telling
Zoe that she came from a cloud.

664
00:27:50,851 --> 00:27:55,254
I really hope her
mom set her straight on that one.

665

So help me with this.

He do I reconcile
that he's right?

667
00:28:04,532 --> 00:28:07,599
Because every time
that I'm in the field,

668
00:28:07,601 --> 00:28:10,769
there's a chance
I don't come back

669
00:28:10,771 --> 00:28:14,139
and that he's alone,

670
00:28:14,141 --> 00:28:16,408
and now you're
telling me that he's

671
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:19,244
gonna have to lie
to an FBI Agent

672
00:28:19,246 --> 00:28:22,981
so that he doesn't
lose his father to prison?

Whoa! I am so insulted
right now!

685

The problem is this place

is massive,

I distributed
the antidote

to Tarkov first can inject him.

should have a signal.

something like, "I see him,"

"Hey. Over there."
