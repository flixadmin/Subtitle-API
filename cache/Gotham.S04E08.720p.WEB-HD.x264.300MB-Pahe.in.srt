1
00:00:00,707 --> 00:00:03,422
- <i>Previously on</i> Gotham...
- You can trust me.

2
00:00:03,447 --> 00:00:04,645
<i>We don't work for you</i>

3
00:00:04,645 --> 00:00:06,625
- and we don't work with you.
- Your captain

4
00:00:06,625 --> 00:00:07,747
<i>says otherwise.</i>

5
00:00:07,751 --> 00:00:09,588
<i>So, Penguin's guys
are gonna beat and torture</i>

6
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:10,589
<i>their way through the city?</i>

7
00:00:10,591 --> 00:00:11,624
Get off of him.

8
00:00:11,626 --> 00:00:12,892
You better pray

9
00:00:12,894 --> 00:00:14,660
I can clean up your
mess on this one, Harvey.

10
00:00:14,662 --> 00:00:15,861
<i>It has to be a trap.</i>

11
00:00:15,863 --> 00:00:17,893
Hey!

12
00:00:17,896 --> 00:00:19,466
<i>Oh, no, Patel.</i>

13
00:00:19,469 --> 00:00:20,634
<i>The Demonz.</i>

14
00:00:20,637 --> 00:00:22,003
<i>They have a chop shop across town.</i>

15
00:00:22,006 --> 00:00:23,272
<i>Let's hit it.</i>

16
00:00:23,275 --> 00:00:25,412
<i>We've got a business to run.</i>

17
00:00:25,415 --> 00:00:26,681
<i>I came here with Grundy.</i>

18
00:00:26,684 --> 00:00:28,426
<i>Make some money to get me smart again.</i>

19
00:00:28,429 --> 00:00:30,005
Hey, I'm looking for the
person in charge here.

20
00:00:30,007 --> 00:00:31,609
You're looking at her.

21
00:00:31,612 --> 00:00:32,855
Go get the doc.

22
00:00:32,858 --> 00:00:35,290
Fight!

23
00:00:35,293 --> 00:00:36,549
Grundy fight now?

24
00:00:36,551 --> 00:00:41,287
Yes! Grundy Ed's best friend.

25
00:00:45,046 --> 00:00:46,965
And now...

26
00:00:46,965 --> 00:00:49,805
the most hated man in Gotham:

27
00:00:49,805 --> 00:00:51,972
The Penguin!

28
00:00:54,109 --> 00:00:57,802
I'm so happy to be here.

29
00:00:58,977 --> 00:01:01,903
You love me. I knew you loved me.

30
00:01:04,757 --> 00:01:06,245
You don't love me?

31
00:01:06,655 --> 00:01:07,855
Get out of here.

32
00:01:07,857 --> 00:01:09,656
You don't love me?

33
00:01:09,658 --> 00:01:11,725
You've asked for it.

34
00:01:11,727 --> 00:01:15,086
I'm going to sic my lackeys onto you.

35
00:01:15,089 --> 00:01:19,281
My hoods and the GCPD!

36
00:01:20,486 --> 00:01:21,935
Get 'em, boys.

37
00:01:21,937 --> 00:01:23,192
Get 'em!

38
00:01:23,192 --> 00:01:25,726
You awful Penguin. You awful Penguin.

39
00:01:25,728 --> 00:01:27,790
You've got to do what I want

40
00:01:27,793 --> 00:01:30,141
or they're gonna enter your homes

41
00:01:30,141 --> 00:01:32,675
and terrorize your families.

42
00:01:32,677 --> 00:01:35,557
Get 'em! Get 'em!

43
00:01:37,081 --> 00:01:38,714
You do what I say.

44
00:01:38,716 --> 00:01:40,437
Grundy. Grundy.

45
00:01:46,724 --> 00:01:48,357
- Let's see some blood!
- Yeah!

46
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:51,726
No! You leave me alone, you monster.

47
00:01:53,197 --> 00:01:55,097
- Yeah!
- Tear him apart!

48
00:02:05,643 --> 00:02:08,077
Stupid, lame...

49
00:02:08,079 --> 00:02:10,880
Birdbrain!

50
00:02:10,882 --> 00:02:12,314
He'll never learn.

51
00:02:12,316 --> 00:02:14,917
You can't mess with the Narrows!

52
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:22,324
It is time...

53
00:02:22,326 --> 00:02:23,592
for the main event!

54
00:02:23,594 --> 00:02:24,693
Get him, Grundy!

55
00:02:24,695 --> 00:02:25,854
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

56
00:02:25,857 --> 00:02:27,496
A title defense.

57
00:02:27,498 --> 00:02:29,064
No refs.

58
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:30,166
No rules.

59
00:02:30,168 --> 00:02:31,796
No rules!

60
00:02:31,799 --> 00:02:34,203
Our challenger:

61
00:02:34,205 --> 00:02:38,961
Mr. Murder Face.

62
00:02:38,964 --> 00:02:40,342
Yeah!

63
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:46,816
And our champeen...

64
00:02:46,818 --> 00:02:49,418
Straight from the Slaughter Swamp,

65
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,724
it's Solomon Grundy.

66
00:02:56,492 --> 00:02:58,365
They really ate it up tonight.

67
00:02:58,367 --> 00:03:02,135
I think they hate
Penguin almost as much as I do.

68
00:03:02,137 --> 00:03:04,149
You know what, I may or
may not find a cure for you.

69
00:03:04,149 --> 00:03:06,583
At the rate you're going,
may not have a chance.

70
00:03:06,585 --> 00:03:07,884
What does that mean?

71
00:03:07,886 --> 00:03:09,653
You don't just have
these people laughing.

72
00:03:09,655 --> 00:03:11,880
- You have them ready for a fight.
- So?

73
00:03:11,883 --> 00:03:14,017
So? So, what happens

74
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,824
when Penguin hears about all this?

75
00:03:15,827 --> 00:03:18,261
Well, let that bird waddle in here.

76
00:03:18,263 --> 00:03:20,997
I have Grundy. I'm gonna be fine.

77
00:03:20,999 --> 00:03:22,699
And what about them? Your fans?

78
00:03:22,701 --> 00:03:24,150
Not my problem.

79
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:27,420
Ed, you've put yourself on
the front line of something.

80
00:03:27,423 --> 00:03:30,940
- You can't just bail when fighting starts.
- Okay, Doctor.

81
00:03:30,943 --> 00:03:32,776
If you would like to
stop hiding from your past

82
00:03:32,776 --> 00:03:35,677
and do some leading, you go right ahead.

83
00:03:36,848 --> 00:03:38,146
That's not what I'm here for.

84
00:03:38,148 --> 00:03:39,847
Well, then, case closed.

85
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,250
Neither of us are willing
to put our necks out.

86
00:03:51,075 --> 00:03:52,260
Oh!

87
00:04:05,262 --> 00:04:07,596
<i>Hey, Butch.</i>

88
00:04:11,982 --> 00:04:14,549
Yeah! Yeah!

89
00:04:15,886 --> 00:04:17,669
<i>Hey, Butch.</i>

90
00:04:32,269 --> 00:04:33,544
Yeah!

91
00:04:39,602 --> 00:04:41,068
Stop hitting yourself!

92
00:04:41,121 --> 00:04:42,400
Stop hitting yourself!

93
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:43,578
Stop hitting yourself!

94
00:04:43,637 --> 00:04:44,881
Stop hitting yourself!

95
00:04:44,981 --> 00:04:46,381
Stop hitting yourself.

96
00:04:46,383 --> 00:04:48,750
I love this.

97
00:04:50,734 --> 00:04:53,989
I love it!

00:05:06,904 --> 00:05:09,871
Congratulations, Captain Gordon.

100
00:05:10,926 --> 00:05:12,743
A promotion.

101
00:05:15,078 --> 00:05:17,245
Harvey Bullock is
captain of Gotham Central.

102
00:05:18,085 --> 00:05:20,649
Bullock's lost the rank and file, Jim.

103
00:05:20,651 --> 00:05:22,884
The debacle in the Narrows.

104
00:05:22,886 --> 00:05:26,502
Teaming up with Penguin's goons.

105
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:30,123
Sending cops into the Pyg's trap.

106
00:05:30,781 --> 00:05:32,450
You know, he's...

107
00:05:32,453 --> 00:05:33,919
he's a disgrace.

108
00:05:33,922 --> 00:05:35,430
What does that make you?

109
00:05:35,432 --> 00:05:36,998
Excuse me?

110
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,633
Last time I checked, you signed over

111
00:05:38,635 --> 00:05:40,902
the entire GCPD to Penguin.

112
00:05:40,904 --> 00:05:42,237
Wholesale.

113
00:05:43,237 --> 00:05:44,734
What does he think of this?

114
00:05:44,734 --> 00:05:46,214
Well, perhaps I've earned

115
00:05:46,214 --> 00:05:48,633
that kind of cynicism, Jim,

116
00:05:48,635 --> 00:05:50,568
but I want to assure you,

117
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:52,236
with hand on heart,

118
00:05:52,238 --> 00:05:55,406
that this has nothing
to do with Mr. Cobblepot.

119
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,792
I won't take Harvey's job.

120
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:00,188
Someone is going to.

121
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,590
And, trust me,

122
00:06:01,593 --> 00:06:03,294
none of our other candidates

123
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:06,449
share your misgivings about Penguin.

124
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,817
Just take it with you.

125
00:06:09,817 --> 00:06:11,960
When you decide, all you have to do

126
00:06:11,984 --> 00:06:13,581
is sign on the dotted line,

127
00:06:14,303 --> 00:06:16,903
and you'll be the new captain

128
00:06:16,903 --> 00:06:18,766
of Gotham Central.

129
00:06:28,915 --> 00:06:31,748
<i>Nobody steals from
the Demonz, Mr. Penguin.</i>

130
00:06:31,748 --> 00:06:34,190
Why do I pony up for
a license if some crook

131
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:36,364
can just swoop in and rip off our swag?

132
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:37,999
Your swag might as well have been

133
00:06:38,002 --> 00:06:39,651
a lollipop in a baby's hand.

134
00:06:39,654 --> 00:06:41,754
You admit it. She
admits it, Mr. Penguin.

135
00:06:41,757 --> 00:06:42,723
Oswald.

136
00:06:42,725 --> 00:06:44,526
What say we resolve
this like professionals?

137
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,277
The ladies and I will take out

138
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:47,846
the rest of these so-called Demonz

139
00:06:47,849 --> 00:06:49,632
and split their goods
with you fifty-fifty.

140
00:06:49,657 --> 00:06:51,658
Uncivilized is what these girls are.

141
00:06:51,658 --> 00:06:52,676
Outside the bounds

142
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:54,249
of a proper criminal society.

143
00:06:54,252 --> 00:06:55,412
What?!

144
00:06:58,497 --> 00:07:00,517
Repeat that for my guests.

145
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:03,954
Uh, Ed Nygma,

146
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:07,108
who-who owes his life
to Mr. Cobblepot's mercy,

147
00:07:07,108 --> 00:07:11,043
is repaying that generosity
by aping his benefactor

148
00:07:11,046 --> 00:07:13,966
in a crude commedia dell'arte.

149
00:07:16,679 --> 00:07:17,719
What?

150
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:19,688
He is making fun of me

151
00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:22,155
in a clown show

152
00:07:22,155 --> 00:07:23,988
in the Narrows!

153
00:07:44,917 --> 00:07:46,284
Pretty funny.

154
00:07:46,284 --> 00:07:48,227
The Riddler's doing a Penguin act.

155
00:07:52,551 --> 00:07:55,022
That is not his name.

156
00:07:55,025 --> 00:07:57,151
His name is Ed.

157
00:07:57,595 --> 00:08:00,327
Plain, dumb Ed.

158
00:08:02,617 --> 00:08:04,298
And you don't know him,

159
00:08:04,298 --> 00:08:06,541
so you don't get to laugh.

160
00:08:08,835 --> 00:08:10,390
Well...

161
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,981
thank you, Oswald, for...

162
00:08:12,536 --> 00:08:13,969
clearing our account.

163
00:08:13,969 --> 00:08:15,611
Not cleared, Babs.

164
00:08:16,675 --> 00:08:18,214
The debt you owe him,

165
00:08:18,214 --> 00:08:19,766
you now owe me.

166
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:22,499
Of course. What'll it be?

167
00:08:22,642 --> 00:08:24,690
Seeing as you love a good laugh,

168
00:08:24,876 --> 00:08:27,089
I would like you to go to the Narrows

169
00:08:27,091 --> 00:08:28,890
and see Ed's act for yourself.

170
00:08:28,892 --> 00:08:30,859
Then I would like you

171
00:08:30,861 --> 00:08:32,016
to bundle him up

172
00:08:32,016 --> 00:08:35,029
and bring him back to me by nightfall.

173
00:08:35,054 --> 00:08:36,895
We're not your toadies.

174
00:08:36,897 --> 00:08:39,364
Dear child, what was that you said?

175
00:08:39,366 --> 00:08:41,361
What do we get

176
00:08:41,364 --> 00:08:43,835
if we bring you Nygma?

177
00:08:44,867 --> 00:08:47,701
Very well.

178
00:08:47,701 --> 00:08:50,426
In exchange, I will...

179
00:08:50,574 --> 00:08:54,105
not set every criminal
in the city after you.

180
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:56,606
I will not let them cut out your eyes

181
00:08:56,606 --> 00:08:59,040
and feed 'em to you,
along with your ears,

182
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:01,541
and then your noses,
and then your tongues.

183
00:09:01,543 --> 00:09:03,225
That is what you get!

184
00:09:03,228 --> 00:09:04,464
Acceptable?

185
00:09:04,467 --> 00:09:06,432
Yes, Oswald.

186
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,249
That is acceptable.

187
00:09:09,231 --> 00:09:11,096
- Well...
- Ladies.

188
00:09:19,503 --> 00:09:22,750
Mr. Penn will put you in contact
with my Narrows informant.

189
00:09:23,132 --> 00:09:26,265
If those three do not
have Ed in hand promptly,

190
00:09:26,435 --> 00:09:30,103
you will go down there and
burn them all to cinders.

191
00:09:30,105 --> 00:09:32,553
What about feeding them
their eyes and all that?

192
00:09:34,176 --> 00:09:36,358
Trust me, it's a great idea

193
00:09:36,361 --> 00:09:40,350
but far too messy to be practical.

194
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:52,726
So, give me the
scoop on this Cherry's joint.

195
00:09:52,728 --> 00:09:54,427
It's mainly crazy prize fights.

196
00:09:54,429 --> 00:09:56,229
Chain saw matches and stuff.

197
00:09:56,231 --> 00:09:57,430
But back in the day

198
00:09:57,432 --> 00:09:59,232
we'd settle our beefs in the ring.

199
00:09:59,234 --> 00:10:00,800
Winner takes all.

200
00:10:00,802 --> 00:10:02,569
The code of the Narrows.

201
00:10:02,571 --> 00:10:04,771
Right. Well, I want to get in, grab Ed,

202
00:10:04,773 --> 00:10:06,573
deliver him to his doom,

203
00:10:06,575 --> 00:10:08,508
and then go find a martini.

204
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,662
Okay?

205
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:12,969
Hello? Earth to Tabby.

206
00:10:13,215 --> 00:10:16,126
Sorry. Thinking about
getting my hands on him.

207
00:10:16,126 --> 00:10:18,937
Yeah. As much as I hate
doing Penguin's dirty work,

208
00:10:18,962 --> 00:10:21,329
this job is like a
little dream come true.

209
00:10:21,331 --> 00:10:22,864
Gonna be Ed's nightmare.

210
00:10:22,866 --> 00:10:25,054
Aren't we worried about
him setting a trap, though?

211
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:26,468
He's a genius.

212
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:28,203
Well, word is...

213
00:10:28,205 --> 00:10:30,867
Ed lost a step when
Penguin put him on ice.

214
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:33,338
But we should be ready for anything.

215
00:10:35,212 --> 00:10:38,480
You insist on persisting

216
00:10:38,482 --> 00:10:40,615
in this misbehavior,

217
00:10:40,617 --> 00:10:42,531
you leave me no choice

218
00:10:42,534 --> 00:10:45,220
but to scold you.

219
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:49,491
You've asked for it!

220
00:10:49,493 --> 00:10:51,159
I'm going to sic

221
00:10:51,162 --> 00:10:54,687
my lackeys upon you. Get 'em, boys.

222
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,631
Get 'em.

223
00:10:58,368 --> 00:11:00,969
Grundy! Grundy!

224
00:11:00,971 --> 00:11:02,304
Grundy! Grundy!

225
00:11:02,307 --> 00:11:04,906
No! No, no, no, no! No!

226
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:20,862
Butch?

227
00:11:35,188 --> 00:11:38,056
Stop hitting
yourself! Stop hitting yourself!

228
00:11:38,058 --> 00:11:39,891
Butch.

229
00:11:39,893 --> 00:11:42,360
It's Butch. Do you know what this means?

230
00:11:42,362 --> 00:11:43,074
Yeah.

231
00:11:43,074 --> 00:11:45,975
It means you owe me an
apology for electrocuting me.

232
00:11:50,824 --> 00:11:53,090
I got to find a way to go talk to him.

233
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,295
Have fun.

234
00:11:55,942 --> 00:11:59,174
Tell him it was nothing personal
when I shot him in the head.

235
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,416
Wow.

236
00:12:05,418 --> 00:12:07,904
I have got to know what
is up with this outfit.

237
00:12:07,907 --> 00:12:08,906
Grundy!

238
00:12:08,909 --> 00:12:10,621
Grundy! Grundy! Grundy!

239
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,957
Could've sworn we had a job to do here.

240
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,993
- Grundy! Grundy! Grundy!
- Yeah, Grundy!

241
00:12:37,667 --> 00:12:39,098
Morning, Harv.

242
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,251
Where have you been?

243
00:12:41,276 --> 00:12:42,901
Ah, sorry. Got stuck in traffic.

244
00:12:43,289 --> 00:12:45,056
What you got there?

245
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:47,706
It's the Bullethole Club today.

246
00:12:48,027 --> 00:12:50,375
These are the slugs they pulled

247
00:12:50,378 --> 00:12:53,742
from the wounded cops
in the Narrows raid.

248
00:12:55,479 --> 00:12:57,797
It was the Pyg that set the trap.

249
00:12:57,822 --> 00:13:00,556
But I was the one who
sent those cops in.

250
00:13:00,897 --> 00:13:03,231
Yeah. You did.

251
00:13:03,233 --> 00:13:05,433
But now we got to move on.

252
00:13:05,435 --> 00:13:06,518
And we got to catch the Pyg

253
00:13:06,518 --> 00:13:08,718
before he can hurt somebody else.

254
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,306
Yeah.

255
00:13:11,309 --> 00:13:12,541
Right.

256
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:14,972
Captain Bullock. Detective.

257
00:13:15,121 --> 00:13:16,359
What's the word, Lucius?

258
00:13:16,361 --> 00:13:18,684
The word is "absence," as in

259
00:13:18,684 --> 00:13:21,285
all of Professor Pyg's
crime scenes demonstrate

260
00:13:21,286 --> 00:13:24,220
a marked absence of
useful physical evidence.

261
00:13:24,222 --> 00:13:25,288
How is that possible?

262
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:26,522
He's a loony.

263
00:13:26,524 --> 00:13:28,391
But a crafty one.

264
00:13:28,393 --> 00:13:29,926
We have to dig deeper,

265
00:13:29,928 --> 00:13:31,794
try and get ahead of
whatever he's planning.

266
00:13:31,796 --> 00:13:33,463
I'm at your disposal.

267
00:13:33,465 --> 00:13:34,797
Hey, Jim.

268
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:37,495
Uh, about the Bullethole Club today.

269
00:13:38,829 --> 00:13:40,323
I'd really appreciate it

270
00:13:41,135 --> 00:13:43,202
if you could be there, too.

271
00:13:44,372 --> 00:13:46,415
- It'd just help me a lot...
- Of course.

272
00:13:46,415 --> 00:13:48,622
I know you have my back, partner.

273
00:13:48,623 --> 00:13:51,036
Of course, Harv. I got your back.

274
00:13:53,609 --> 00:13:55,104
<i>The Bullethole Club?</i>

275
00:13:55,107 --> 00:13:56,962
Cops shot in the line of duty.

276
00:13:56,964 --> 00:13:58,264
New members joining today.

277
00:13:58,266 --> 00:13:59,598
How's that work?

278
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,867
It's unofficial. Little
ceremony at a bar.

279
00:14:01,869 --> 00:14:05,471
Commanding officer hands them
the bullet they were shot with.

280
00:14:05,473 --> 00:14:08,594
This batch, cops wounded in Pyg's trap.

281
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:10,397
And Harvey has to
give 'em their bullets?

282
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,197
Yeah. Including the officer he shot.

283
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,013
No wonder he wants a friend there.

284
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,970
Yeah. No wonder.

285
00:14:19,156 --> 00:14:23,556
Leave it to Ed Nygma to
find a way to turn his idiocy

286
00:14:23,558 --> 00:14:26,225
into a tool for revenge.

287
00:14:26,227 --> 00:14:29,153
And everything was running so tidily.

288
00:14:29,156 --> 00:14:31,063
Now I have nothing but headaches.

289
00:14:31,065 --> 00:14:34,834
No one appreciates how hard
it is to be a crime lord.

290
00:14:34,836 --> 00:14:38,037
I did actually spend my
childhood being raised by one.

291
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:39,505
My very point.

292
00:14:39,907 --> 00:14:41,440
In fact,

293
00:14:42,536 --> 00:14:44,952
I thought we would have lunch together

294
00:14:44,952 --> 00:14:48,386
and talk over the vagaries
of this capricious calling.

295
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,387
I'd love to help, but I
have to see the caterer

296
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,989
for the orphanage fund-raiser.

297
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,658
Of course.

298
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:58,329
I can't expect you to
be at my beck and call.

299
00:15:04,401 --> 00:15:07,037
You need a different source
of relaxation, Oswald.

300
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:09,240
Um...

301
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:11,475
You need chickens.

302
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:13,944
I'm sorry?

303
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:16,093
Do you remember my father's chickens?

304
00:15:16,096 --> 00:15:18,859
I seem to recall the don's

305
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:20,572
predilection for poultry.

306
00:15:20,597 --> 00:15:23,258
He understood that life
couldn't just be about business.

307
00:15:23,258 --> 00:15:28,161
When his troubles were greatest,
he spent time with his birds.

308
00:15:29,394 --> 00:15:30,330
You think I need...

309
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,731
chickens?

310
00:15:32,361 --> 00:15:34,951
An interest outside the
business. Give it some thought.

311
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:36,931
We'll talk about it when I get back.

312
00:15:41,143 --> 00:15:43,637
Chickens.

313
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:46,085
Chick, chick, chickens.

314
00:15:55,284 --> 00:15:56,567
Loser!

315
00:15:57,038 --> 00:15:58,348
- Wedgie!
- Aw!

316
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:01,017
Aw! That must've hurt!

317
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:04,187
Grab him! Martin!
Squeeze his arm harder!

318
00:16:19,004 --> 00:16:20,970
Boy!

319
00:16:20,972 --> 00:16:22,746
Come here this instant.

320
00:16:26,084 --> 00:16:27,860
What do you think you're doing?

321
00:16:39,925 --> 00:16:42,346
You cannot do things like that.

322
00:16:43,911 --> 00:16:46,683
Your enemies
will know it was you.

323
00:16:49,566 --> 00:16:51,783
Grundy! Grundy!

324
00:16:51,785 --> 00:16:54,319
Grundy! Grundy!

325
00:16:54,321 --> 00:16:55,587
Butch.

326
00:17:01,161 --> 00:17:03,295
You're alive.

327
00:17:03,297 --> 00:17:05,664
Huh?

328
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:12,972
Oh, Butch.

329
00:17:14,729 --> 00:17:16,231
What happened to you?

330
00:17:23,578 --> 00:17:24,904
Guess who.

331
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,320
Psycho-killer stalker?

332
00:17:28,322 --> 00:17:29,975
Got it in one.

333
00:17:30,792 --> 00:17:31,719
Please.

334
00:17:31,744 --> 00:17:33,844
If you were gonna pop,
you'd have done it already.

335
00:17:35,463 --> 00:17:37,088
Whew, that felt good.

336
00:17:37,091 --> 00:17:38,931
Been waiting a long time to do that.

337
00:17:39,473 --> 00:17:40,566
Other cheek?

338
00:17:40,568 --> 00:17:42,068
I'm good, thanks.

339
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,903
So what are you doing
down here, Barbara?

340
00:17:43,905 --> 00:17:45,838
This is a low-rent neighborhood for you.

341
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,174
Yeah. If it wasn't for Penguin,
you wouldn't catch me dead

342
00:17:48,176 --> 00:17:50,076
- in a place like this.
- Oh.

343
00:17:50,078 --> 00:17:52,211
You're working as Penguin's flunky.

344
00:17:52,213 --> 00:17:53,612
That suits you.

345
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:58,250
Yes, and you seem to be thriving
with your current life choices.

346
00:17:58,252 --> 00:18:01,654
We don't all make decisions
based on what it can get us.

347
00:18:01,656 --> 00:18:03,656
There are other people in the world.

348
00:18:03,658 --> 00:18:04,657
Wow.

349
00:18:04,659 --> 00:18:07,460
Sexy and self-righteous.

350
00:18:07,462 --> 00:18:09,810
What does Jim think of this new you?

351
00:18:11,677 --> 00:18:13,685
Jim who?

352
00:18:16,175 --> 00:18:20,049
Well, I have to go see a man
about a kidnapping. But this...

353
00:18:20,052 --> 00:18:22,341
has been interesting.

354
00:18:22,343 --> 00:18:23,676
Toodles, poodle.

355
00:18:31,185 --> 00:18:33,853
Kidnapping. Oh, crap.

356
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:39,725
You play
a great Penguin, mister.

357
00:18:39,727 --> 00:18:41,994
Yeah. Sure, sure. Thanks, kid.

358
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:48,667
Oh, crud.

359
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:53,806
I thought you were supposed to be smart.

360
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:04,926
Relax, Jim, no one followed me.

361
00:19:05,108 --> 00:19:07,275
I have Oswald wrapped around my finger.

362
00:19:07,277 --> 00:19:09,612
If you have such a good
grip on him, explain that.

363
00:19:09,792 --> 00:19:11,992
Why would he want me
promoted? What's his plan?

364
00:19:11,994 --> 00:19:14,327
Oswald has nothing to do with this.

365
00:19:14,329 --> 00:19:16,952
The commissioner and the mayor
can feel the winds changing,

366
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:19,956
and they want to be out
ahead of it before it blows.

367
00:19:21,837 --> 00:19:23,303
It was you.

368
00:19:23,305 --> 00:19:25,202
You put them up to this.

369
00:19:27,109 --> 00:19:29,376
You must have made a
hell of a contribution

370
00:19:29,378 --> 00:19:31,712
to get the mayor to defy Penguin.

371
00:19:31,714 --> 00:19:34,304
No contribution necessary, Jim.

372
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:38,285
Just the Falcone name and...
everything that it implies.

373
00:19:38,896 --> 00:19:40,320
Well, I won't do it.

374
00:19:40,322 --> 00:19:41,822
Not like this.

375
00:19:41,824 --> 00:19:43,824
And not at Harvey's expense.

376
00:19:43,826 --> 00:19:45,810
Harvey is weak.

377
00:19:46,905 --> 00:19:48,695
How much longer do you
plan on propping him up?

378
00:19:48,697 --> 00:19:52,032
And how many more cops need to
die because of his incompetence?

379
00:19:54,295 --> 00:19:55,961
I need to go.

380
00:19:55,971 --> 00:19:59,272
And you need to stop pretending
like you're not taking that job.

381
00:20:00,101 --> 00:20:01,007
I'm not pretending.

382
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,486
So you say, Jim,

383
00:20:02,486 --> 00:20:04,678
but I don't see you rushing
to throw that piece of paper

384
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,213
in the trash.

385
00:20:06,215 --> 00:20:07,880
Come see me tonight.

386
00:20:08,017 --> 00:20:09,207
After you take command.

387
00:20:09,207 --> 00:20:10,473
We will celebrate.

388
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:21,995
Revenge is never as simple
as a mere tit for a tat.

389
00:20:21,997 --> 00:20:25,532
Revenge must be specific in nature. Now,

390
00:20:25,534 --> 00:20:29,369
when you imagine revenge against
your two juvenile tormentors,

391
00:20:29,371 --> 00:20:31,271
what do you see?

392
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:44,489
That might be a little overly ambitious.

393
00:20:45,164 --> 00:20:46,854
We must be crafty.

394
00:20:46,856 --> 00:20:48,655
For instance,

395
00:20:48,657 --> 00:20:52,165
friendship can be an
especially deadly tactic.

396
00:20:52,661 --> 00:20:56,040
How do you think you might
use friendship to drive a wedge

397
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,007
between your two antagonists?

398
00:21:04,717 --> 00:21:07,050
"They're both flunking math."

399
00:21:07,052 --> 00:21:11,295
And you, I imagine,
are very good at math?

400
00:21:14,026 --> 00:21:15,359
Excellent.

401
00:21:15,842 --> 00:21:17,049
Tell me more.

402
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:32,226
Psst.

403
00:21:32,653 --> 00:21:33,654
Psst.

404
00:21:44,325 --> 00:21:46,292
Hey, Martin!

405
00:21:48,763 --> 00:21:51,163
Thank you.

406
00:22:08,235 --> 00:22:09,901
What's wrong, Martin?

407
00:22:09,902 --> 00:22:11,635
Who did that to you?

408
00:22:11,637 --> 00:22:13,237
Hey.

409
00:22:14,923 --> 00:22:16,255
Why you picking on Martin?

410
00:22:16,258 --> 00:22:18,459
You like that dummy so
much, go play with him.

411
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:19,627
He's not a dummy!

412
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:20,863
Yes, he is.

413
00:22:24,477 --> 00:22:25,810
Well done.

414
00:22:26,601 --> 00:22:28,840
Feels good, does it not?

415
00:22:29,857 --> 00:22:33,276
Minions are so much better than friends.

416
00:22:40,199 --> 00:22:41,899
"But I'm your..."

417
00:22:44,887 --> 00:22:46,679
The greatest friend I ever had

418
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:48,746
turned into my worst enemy.

419
00:22:48,748 --> 00:22:50,665
Shun friendship.

420
00:22:52,075 --> 00:22:53,467
You and I...

421
00:22:53,467 --> 00:22:55,667
we're more than friends.

422
00:22:55,669 --> 00:22:57,517
We're conspirators.

423
00:23:00,423 --> 00:23:02,140
Are you not gonna fight back?

424
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:25,030
Peekaboo.

425
00:23:27,234 --> 00:23:30,001
Well, look at the little go-getter.

426
00:23:30,004 --> 00:23:32,938
Yeah. Well, you and Tabby
decided to freak out,

427
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,873
so someone had to be the professional.

428
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:36,541
Teenagers, Ed.

429
00:23:36,543 --> 00:23:37,943
Don't you love 'em?

430
00:23:39,513 --> 00:23:41,951
Do you remember anything, Butch?

431
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:45,461
Do you remember anything about us?

432
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:54,996
Doesn't this mean anything to you?

433
00:24:04,091 --> 00:24:05,127
Ed!

434
00:24:05,138 --> 00:24:06,070
Butch!

435
00:24:06,073 --> 00:24:07,616
Tell zombie Butch to back off.

436
00:24:07,616 --> 00:24:09,246
Grundy kill everyone!

437
00:24:09,246 --> 00:24:10,245
Butch!

438
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:12,063
Ed is not your friend.

439
00:24:12,066 --> 00:24:13,281
Rip 'em to pieces!

440
00:24:13,284 --> 00:24:14,632
Butch!

441
00:24:14,632 --> 00:24:17,066
All right. Everybody just take it easy.

442
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:19,811
Selina, what are you
doing with these two?

443
00:24:20,134 --> 00:24:21,665
Looking for trouble.

444
00:24:21,665 --> 00:24:23,932
Well, you found plenty
of it, trying to take Ed.

445
00:24:23,935 --> 00:24:25,176
Let him go.

446
00:24:25,179 --> 00:24:26,879
You're such a bleeding heart, Lee.

447
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:28,882
I thought you'd change, but turns out,

448
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:30,450
just got a new hairdo.

449
00:24:30,453 --> 00:24:32,262
Code of the Narrows.

450
00:24:32,265 --> 00:24:33,697
Code of the Narrows.

451
00:24:35,111 --> 00:24:36,786
Let's settle it in the ring.

452
00:24:36,789 --> 00:24:38,322
Champion against champion.

453
00:24:38,325 --> 00:24:40,014
The winner would take Ed.

454
00:24:40,739 --> 00:24:41,917
So your best fighter

455
00:24:41,942 --> 00:24:43,302
against my fighter?

456
00:24:44,767 --> 00:24:47,119
Yeah, let's do that.

457
00:24:59,556 --> 00:25:02,984
Honk-honk. Honk-honk.

458
00:25:03,141 --> 00:25:05,041
You Narrows trash

459
00:25:05,043 --> 00:25:08,010
have been very, very naughty.

460
00:25:08,012 --> 00:25:11,347
You've been hiding someone from me.

461
00:25:11,349 --> 00:25:13,616
Don't listen to him.

462
00:25:13,618 --> 00:25:15,184
He's not my friend.

463
00:25:15,186 --> 00:25:17,581
No, Ed. No one's gonna save you.

464
00:25:17,584 --> 00:25:19,522
Ed. Grundy.

465
00:25:19,524 --> 00:25:21,339
No one can save you. Save me!

466
00:25:21,342 --> 00:25:24,360
Oh, no. Help.

467
00:25:24,362 --> 00:25:26,612
Help. Save me.

468
00:25:32,369 --> 00:25:36,151
Ladies and Grundy fans.

469
00:25:37,542 --> 00:25:39,809
Tonight is a special edition

470
00:25:39,811 --> 00:25:41,022
of fight night.

471
00:25:41,025 --> 00:25:44,214
A good old Narrows grudge match.

472
00:25:44,217 --> 00:25:46,482
Winner takes...

473
00:25:46,484 --> 00:25:48,718
me.

474
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,155
And featuring your champeen

475
00:25:52,157 --> 00:25:56,424
Solomon Grundy...

476
00:25:56,848 --> 00:25:58,349
versus...

477
00:25:59,462 --> 00:26:01,451
Tabby...

478
00:26:01,718 --> 00:26:04,552
the Tigress.

479
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:09,550
Tabs, I know this was my idea, but...

480
00:26:09,742 --> 00:26:11,033
No, it's okay.

481
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:13,070
Butch is still in there. I know he is.

482
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,672
He loves me too much to hurt me.

483
00:26:14,675 --> 00:26:17,872
Grundy kill!

484
00:26:17,875 --> 00:26:20,390
Babe, I love your faith,

485
00:26:20,392 --> 00:26:22,259
but I really think you should take this.

486
00:26:23,761 --> 00:26:25,761
No. He won't hurt me.

487
00:26:25,764 --> 00:26:27,397
I'll just choke him out, no problem.

488
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:46,729
Tabitha and Grundy were lovers

489
00:26:46,729 --> 00:26:48,266
before he got this way.

490
00:26:48,266 --> 00:26:49,951
What if he goes easy on her?

491
00:26:49,976 --> 00:26:51,376
Grundy will win.

492
00:26:52,131 --> 00:26:54,468
Not that it makes a difference, anyway.

493
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,950
What does that mean?

494
00:26:57,058 --> 00:26:58,764
The Penguin wants Ed.

495
00:26:59,955 --> 00:27:01,542
He's gonna get him.

496
00:27:10,998 --> 00:27:12,097
Come on, Butch.

497
00:27:12,366 --> 00:27:14,567
I know you could never forget me.

498
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:16,969
You're still in there, I know it.

499
00:27:18,706 --> 00:27:20,573
Grundy!

500
00:27:23,544 --> 00:27:25,856
Tabby, come on,
Tabs. Come on, get up.

501
00:27:25,859 --> 00:27:27,058
Get up.

502
00:27:27,083 --> 00:27:28,082
Tabby, get up.

503
00:27:32,086 --> 00:27:33,685
No. No, Butch.

504
00:27:33,688 --> 00:27:35,254
No, Butch!

505
00:27:35,256 --> 00:27:36,104
Tabs!

506
00:27:38,259 --> 00:27:40,092
Oh!

507
00:27:59,951 --> 00:28:01,484
Hey, Butch.

508
00:28:14,962 --> 00:28:16,128
Tabby?

509
00:28:17,064 --> 00:28:19,198
Oh!

510
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,000
Butch?

511
00:28:23,537 --> 00:28:25,117
No! No!

512
00:28:31,504 --> 00:28:33,922
- I'll get you one more.
- Yeah.

513
00:28:34,865 --> 00:28:36,416
I don't know what to tell you.

514
00:28:45,394 --> 00:28:47,342
Come on, buddy.

515
00:28:48,367 --> 00:28:49,895
You Detective Gordon?

516
00:28:51,234 --> 00:28:52,273
Yeah.

517
00:28:52,533 --> 00:28:55,190
Harvey said as how I
should give this to you.

518
00:28:55,193 --> 00:28:56,860
Said you'd know what to do with it.

519
00:28:58,973 --> 00:29:00,564
When was he here?

520
00:29:00,567 --> 00:29:02,408
Uh, a couple hours ago.

521
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:04,510
Before you all started coming in here.

522
00:29:05,057 --> 00:29:06,066
Thanks.

523
00:30:16,117 --> 00:30:17,483
Get up! Come on!

524
00:30:20,054 --> 00:30:21,920
Come on, Butch. Come on, baby.

525
00:30:21,922 --> 00:30:23,455
Wake up. Come on, Butch.

526
00:30:23,457 --> 00:30:25,236
- Tabitha, we've got to go, now.
- Come on, baby.

527
00:30:25,236 --> 00:30:26,602
Ladies, let's amscray.

528
00:30:30,773 --> 00:30:33,289
- Come on. Come on.
- I'll come back for you, Butch.

529
00:30:34,618 --> 00:30:36,433
What happened to
the code of the Narrows?

530
00:30:36,433 --> 00:30:37,766
Give me up, Bra-Bra.

531
00:30:37,768 --> 00:30:39,334
You're getting out
of here empty-handed.

532
00:30:42,733 --> 00:30:45,896
In the name of Penguin,
everybody back the hell off.

533
00:30:46,626 --> 00:30:47,557
Well,

534
00:30:48,361 --> 00:30:50,851
look at that... cavalry.

535
00:30:50,878 --> 00:30:52,340
Not so fast.

536
00:30:52,343 --> 00:30:54,146
Boss gave you a deadline.

537
00:30:54,148 --> 00:30:55,515
You missed it.

538
00:30:55,518 --> 00:30:57,276
So what? We got Ed.

539
00:30:57,276 --> 00:30:59,414
We are literally champions here.

540
00:30:59,414 --> 00:31:02,148
What you are is four
courses of barbecue.

541
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:04,007
Crispy skin.

542
00:31:09,776 --> 00:31:12,222
Grundy, wake up.

543
00:31:12,225 --> 00:31:14,651
Grundy!

544
00:31:14,653 --> 00:31:16,089
Get up, big guy, come on.

545
00:31:22,594 --> 00:31:24,561
Grundy kill!

546
00:31:32,712 --> 00:31:35,180
What's the matter, gruesome?

547
00:31:35,183 --> 00:31:36,573
Afraid of fire?

548
00:31:36,575 --> 00:31:37,841
Come on, Bridgit.

549
00:31:37,843 --> 00:31:39,549
Don't do this. You're from the Narrows.

550
00:31:39,549 --> 00:31:42,291
Yeah. And I couldn't
be happier to be out.

551
00:31:42,897 --> 00:31:45,264
Penguin's right about this place.

552
00:31:45,266 --> 00:31:46,798
It's a sewer.

553
00:31:47,217 --> 00:31:48,644
Only way to kill the stink

554
00:31:48,644 --> 00:31:50,219
is to burn it.

555
00:31:50,222 --> 00:31:52,009
Hey, Firefly.

556
00:31:52,012 --> 00:31:54,969
You're the only thing
that stinks around here.

557
00:32:04,465 --> 00:32:05,747
You know what you've done?

558
00:32:05,747 --> 00:32:07,862
Firefly's Penguin's enforcer.

559
00:32:08,876 --> 00:32:11,892
And who's the one who got
Firefly down here, Cherry?

560
00:32:13,384 --> 00:32:16,318
She informed on Ed to Penguin.

561
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,520
What?!

562
00:32:22,577 --> 00:32:24,243
- You're a snitch, Cherry.
- Shut up.

563
00:32:24,246 --> 00:32:25,817
You're over. It's done.

564
00:32:25,817 --> 00:32:27,148
Shut up.

565
00:32:27,151 --> 00:32:29,952
This is my club. It's my turf.

566
00:32:29,955 --> 00:32:32,520
You guys just do as you're
told like the scum you are.

567
00:32:34,425 --> 00:32:36,427
They're the ones that are the problem.

568
00:32:37,028 --> 00:32:38,944
They work for Penguin.

569
00:32:40,735 --> 00:32:42,468
Oh!

570
00:32:46,037 --> 00:32:47,616
I would like to announce

571
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:50,684
that we just quit working for Penguin.

572
00:33:00,042 --> 00:33:01,742
Yeah! Do it!

573
00:33:01,744 --> 00:33:02,739
God, they sure love

574
00:33:02,739 --> 00:33:04,439
their cold-blooded
murder down here, huh?

575
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,639
Yeah, well, we better split

576
00:33:05,641 --> 00:33:07,141
before they decide they want more.

577
00:33:07,143 --> 00:33:08,609
Hey.

578
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:09,877
It's okay, big guy.

579
00:33:09,879 --> 00:33:11,946
Fire lady... she can't hurt you.

580
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:15,215
Ah. Grundy safe.

581
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,506
Where were you, Harvey?

582
00:33:42,878 --> 00:33:44,334
Hey, Jim.

583
00:33:44,914 --> 00:33:46,722
I was just having a...

584
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:49,665
little drinky-poo.

585
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:51,956
Why don't you join me?

586
00:33:51,959 --> 00:33:53,359
Not right now.

587
00:33:53,362 --> 00:33:55,028
Come on, Jim. Don't be like that.

588
00:33:55,031 --> 00:33:58,651
Come on, sit down and
have a drink with me.

589
00:34:08,688 --> 00:34:10,911
Those cops were waiting for you.

590
00:34:11,899 --> 00:34:14,128
Yeah, to spit in my face.

591
00:34:14,569 --> 00:34:17,036
If that's what they wanted to do,

592
00:34:17,038 --> 00:34:19,372
you owed it to them to be there,

593
00:34:19,374 --> 00:34:21,583
to stand in front of 'em,

594
00:34:21,586 --> 00:34:23,820
look each one in the eye.

595
00:34:26,312 --> 00:34:27,733
If you'd have done that...

596
00:34:30,248 --> 00:34:32,974
maybe you could have
gotten their respect.

597
00:34:35,337 --> 00:34:37,176
I don't deserve their respect.

598
00:34:38,137 --> 00:34:40,604
Jim, I shot Officer Patel.

599
00:34:40,606 --> 00:34:42,619
What the hell was I supposed to do?

600
00:34:42,708 --> 00:34:44,941
Stand in front of her
and hand her the bullet

601
00:34:44,941 --> 00:34:47,275
that I shot her with,
that came from my gun?

602
00:34:47,277 --> 00:34:48,643
That's the job.

603
00:34:50,297 --> 00:34:51,879
Take responsibility for what happens

604
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:53,447
to your cops... that's the job.

605
00:34:53,449 --> 00:34:54,715
Oh.

606
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:57,959
So now...

607
00:34:58,821 --> 00:35:01,389
you're telling me what the job is?

608
00:35:05,758 --> 00:35:07,102
Yeah.

609
00:35:10,125 --> 00:35:12,023
Well, today, Jim...

610
00:35:13,229 --> 00:35:15,336
I just couldn't do the job.

611
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:19,288
So I sent you

612
00:35:20,065 --> 00:35:21,514
because I knew...

613
00:35:22,068 --> 00:35:23,417
you could.

614
00:35:24,338 --> 00:35:26,304
It's not good enough.

615
00:35:28,685 --> 00:35:30,685
Not today.

616
00:35:30,687 --> 00:35:32,653
They needed you there.

617
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:35,074
Well...

618
00:35:36,186 --> 00:35:38,253
ain't nothing I can do about it now.

619
00:35:53,576 --> 00:35:55,643
You got a pen?

620
00:35:55,645 --> 00:35:57,609
For what?

621
00:36:09,511 --> 00:36:13,269
Harvey Bullock, you
are relieved of duty.

622
00:36:14,174 --> 00:36:17,832
As of this moment, I'm assuming
the captaincy of Gotham Central.

623
00:36:21,537 --> 00:36:23,162
Well, well.

624
00:36:24,474 --> 00:36:27,408
Look who finally got
what he always wanted.

625
00:36:28,448 --> 00:36:30,297
But what I'm wondering is,

626
00:36:31,351 --> 00:36:33,840
what did you have to do to get it?

627
00:36:35,082 --> 00:36:37,249
All I did was my job, same as you.

628
00:36:37,251 --> 00:36:39,151
Nothing in Gotham is free...

629
00:36:41,021 --> 00:36:42,561
Captain Gordon.

630
00:36:53,304 --> 00:36:56,609
You just better hope you can
pay up when your bill's due.

631
00:36:57,956 --> 00:36:59,367
And it'll come due.

632
00:37:18,546 --> 00:37:21,013
Huh? Now you try.

633
00:37:27,002 --> 00:37:28,469
Uh...

634
00:37:29,757 --> 00:37:32,182
Ah. You've met Martin, I see.

635
00:37:32,185 --> 00:37:34,427
Shh. He's practicing.

636
00:37:34,429 --> 00:37:36,262
No. It's up.

637
00:37:36,264 --> 00:37:38,760
Upward, Martin, so that way you drive

638
00:37:38,763 --> 00:37:40,662
the blade under the
ribs and into the heart.

639
00:37:40,665 --> 00:37:42,127
Oswald?

640
00:37:42,502 --> 00:37:45,510
Entirely theoretically
speaking, of course.

641
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:51,840
Mr. Penn?

642
00:37:52,056 --> 00:37:54,808
Urgent matters, Mr. Cobblepot.

643
00:37:55,126 --> 00:37:58,387
It seems that Ms. Kean and
her associates have failed

644
00:37:58,387 --> 00:38:00,554
to retrieve Mr. Nygma.

645
00:38:01,275 --> 00:38:03,044
Did you dispatch Firefly?

646
00:38:03,044 --> 00:38:03,994
I did.

647
00:38:03,995 --> 00:38:07,480
And Ms. Firefly was
herself, in turn, disabled.

648
00:38:07,483 --> 00:38:08,731
What?!

649
00:38:08,733 --> 00:38:10,070
There's more.

650
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:12,328
Yes?!

651
00:38:12,753 --> 00:38:13,670
The mayor,

652
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:15,450
at his own discretion, has seen fit

653
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:18,997
to promote Detective Gordon
to the rank... of captain.

654
00:38:27,692 --> 00:38:29,049
That is...

655
00:38:31,596 --> 00:38:34,021
That is... quite a lot

656
00:38:34,021 --> 00:38:36,168
to go awry in one day.

657
00:38:39,174 --> 00:38:41,732
Very good, Mr. Cobblepot.

658
00:38:43,595 --> 00:38:44,961
You see, Oswald?

659
00:38:44,963 --> 00:38:47,597
Business is not the end-all of life.

660
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:49,766
There are other rewards to be had.

661
00:38:49,768 --> 00:38:52,002
Companionship, peace of mind.

662
00:38:53,071 --> 00:38:55,071
Friendship.

663
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:00,911
Oh, I have to get back to the estate.

664
00:39:00,913 --> 00:39:02,618
I still have so much to
do for the fund-raiser.

665
00:39:02,618 --> 00:39:04,262
Will you be joining me later for dinner?

666
00:39:04,262 --> 00:39:05,747
I think not.

667
00:39:06,131 --> 00:39:07,839
Martin needs some more practice.

668
00:39:07,842 --> 00:39:09,008
Okay.

669
00:39:15,874 --> 00:39:17,077
Martin,

670
00:39:18,169 --> 00:39:19,662
remind me.

671
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:21,621
What did we learn today?

672
00:39:22,506 --> 00:39:25,641
What did we learn about friendship?

673
00:39:31,521 --> 00:39:34,483
Exactly. Sometimes,

674
00:39:34,485 --> 00:39:36,537
if you're not very careful,

675
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,855
friendship can blind you

676
00:39:37,855 --> 00:39:39,755
to what is staring
you right in the face.

677
00:39:59,778 --> 00:40:01,544
"Hey, Firefly.

678
00:40:01,546 --> 00:40:04,480
You're the only thing
that stinks around here."

679
00:40:04,483 --> 00:40:07,717
I get melodramatic under pressure.

680
00:40:07,719 --> 00:40:10,120
How you feeling, big fella?

681
00:40:11,967 --> 00:40:14,289
- Grundy confused.
- Yeah.

682
00:40:14,292 --> 00:40:15,960
Tell me about it.

683
00:40:26,595 --> 00:40:28,428
What's with them?

684
00:40:28,431 --> 00:40:29,863
They're, uh...

685
00:40:30,499 --> 00:40:32,515
They're acknowledging their new leader.

686
00:40:34,692 --> 00:40:36,751
Well, like I said, they love you.

687
00:40:36,751 --> 00:40:40,372
Uh, Lee, I'm supposed
to be the stupid one.

688
00:40:40,372 --> 00:40:41,990
You heal their children.

689
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:43,987
You stitch up their warriors.

690
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:46,252
You've slain a fire-breathing monster,

691
00:40:46,252 --> 00:40:48,109
and you helped topple the queen.

692
00:40:48,109 --> 00:40:49,842
This is your turf now.

693
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:53,525
No, no, no, no, no, I am not a leader.

694
00:40:53,525 --> 00:40:54,794
Okay, well, if you don't do it,

695
00:40:54,794 --> 00:40:57,195
somebody else will,
probably worse than Cherry.

696
00:41:12,152 --> 00:41:13,558
Where do I start?

697
00:41:13,933 --> 00:41:15,283
I don't know. Just...

698
00:41:15,283 --> 00:41:17,750
make 'em happy, give 'em
something to cheer for.

699
00:41:20,069 --> 00:41:21,841
Drinks on the house.

700
00:41:27,263 --> 00:41:28,842
Good move.

701
00:41:45,616 --> 00:41:47,449
Why, Captain Gordon,

702
00:41:47,451 --> 00:41:49,851
you came to celebrate after all.

703
00:41:49,851 --> 00:41:51,427
I'm not here to celebrate.

704
00:41:52,686 --> 00:41:55,720
What's wrong? I made
you captain, didn't I?

705
00:41:55,722 --> 00:41:57,228
You made me?

706
00:41:57,758 --> 00:41:59,480
Is that what you think?

707
00:42:01,197 --> 00:42:02,225
Jim.

708
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:04,174
You can toy with Penguin all you want,

709
00:42:04,174 --> 00:42:05,995
but I am not your puppet.

710
00:42:05,995 --> 00:42:07,800
No, you're not.

711
00:42:07,803 --> 00:42:09,430
You're my partner.

712
00:42:09,432 --> 00:42:10,864
Your partner?

713
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:15,045
I just stuck a knife
in my partner's back.

714
00:42:17,106 --> 00:42:19,638
A mercy killing if you ask me.

715
00:42:21,474 --> 00:42:24,397
Grow up. You wanted

716
00:42:24,397 --> 00:42:26,515
a gangster to help
you get rid of Penguin.

717
00:42:26,517 --> 00:42:29,030
This is what that help looks like.

718
00:42:30,434 --> 00:42:33,635
Harvey.... had... to go.

719
00:42:38,998 --> 00:42:41,201
I don't need your help anymore.

720
00:42:42,777 --> 00:42:44,838
I think it's time you left Gotham.

721
00:42:47,366 --> 00:42:49,596
I'm not going anywhere, Jim.

722
00:42:51,908 --> 00:42:53,750
I came to restore the Falcone name,

723
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:56,208
and that's exactly what I'm going to do.

724
00:42:56,208 --> 00:43:00,680
So, do you want to come in
and celebrate... Captain?

725
00:43:03,281 --> 00:43:06,074
Think I'll stay out
here where I can breathe.

726
00:43:23,922 --> 00:43:29,428
