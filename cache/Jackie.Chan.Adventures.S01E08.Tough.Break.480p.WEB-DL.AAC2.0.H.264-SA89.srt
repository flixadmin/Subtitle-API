Sold for $200.

00:00:05,106 --> 00:00:07,506
The next item up for auction
is a porcelain lamp

3
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:12,811
featuring, well,
an unusual rat motif.

4
00:00:12,813 --> 00:00:14,513
What am I bid
for this piece?

5
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:16,348
$100.

00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,417

00:00:21,287 --> 00:00:23,222

That's all

17
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:37,469

$2,000.

19
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:41,573

Going twice...

Sold for--

22
00:00:47,181 --> 00:00:48,747
aah!

23
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,322
I'm sorry.
I'll send you
a check, ok?

24
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:16,308
Huh?!

25
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,243
Unh! Oh!

26
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:20,779
This building
should be condemned.

27
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:33,525
Whoa-oh!

28
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,461
Unh!

29
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:42,134
Hmm...

30
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:44,336
Hey! My hat!

31
00:01:44,338 --> 00:01:45,804
This area's
restricted!

32
00:01:45,806 --> 00:01:48,407
We're blowin' up
the--oof!

33
00:01:55,014 --> 00:01:57,749
Whaaaaa!

34
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,787
Yes! Yes!

35
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:11,390
Noooo!

36
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:15,894
Another train wreck,
Jackie?

37
00:03:15,896 --> 00:03:18,497
Uh, I was going to
ask you the same thing.

38
00:03:18,499 --> 00:03:21,366
Do baboons live here?

39
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:25,037
Jade, you must learn
to clean up after--

40
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,471
you've got it,
Jackie-o.

41
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:29,041
Tell ya what--
- I'll clean the whole place,

42
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:31,743
and you can reward me
with, oh...

43
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:32,878
I don't know,

44
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,413
a turbo troll?

45
00:03:34,415 --> 00:03:36,381
You already have
one of those.

46
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,083
Uh-uh! I have gnomekop.

47
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:39,685
Turbo troll
is his mortal enemy,

48
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:41,720
and if I get both of them,
they'll fight each other.

49
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:43,088
Everyone's collecting them,
Jackie.

50
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,991
Can I please have one,
please?

51
00:03:45,993 --> 00:03:49,428
Mmm, we'll talk about it
when you finish cleaning.

52
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,629
[Chuckling to himself]

53
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:52,798
Gnomekop:
Gnome power!

54
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,899
Jackie: Oof!

55
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:55,234
[Gasps] Gnomekop!

56
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:57,069
Must find
turbo troll.

57
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:58,704
Must find
turbo troll.

58
00:03:58,706 --> 00:04:01,540
[Sighs in relief]
It's ok, Jackie.

59
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:03,375
Nothing's broken.

60
00:04:03,377 --> 00:04:05,711
Oh-ohhhh...

61
00:04:05,713 --> 00:04:06,912
Jackie?

62
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:08,847
Ooh! Ah!

63
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:10,015
Ow! Ooh!

64
00:04:10,017 --> 00:04:13,719
Run down the side
of an exploding
building--

65
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:14,987
no problem!

66
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:17,022
But step
on a child's toy,

67
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,257
break your bones.

68
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:20,058
Wah ha ha ha!

69
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,594
Sounds like
a Chinese proverb...

70
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,763
Oh! It's all my fault.

71
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:27,266
Huh! Jackie
is young and strong.

72
00:04:27,268 --> 00:04:29,768
He will heal
quickly.

73
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,170
Accidents happen, Jade.

74
00:04:32,172 --> 00:04:35,007
But do you now see
the importance
of tidiness?

75
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:36,675
I'll make it up
to you, Jackie.

76
00:04:36,677 --> 00:04:38,577
I promise.

77
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,216
How's my patient?

78
00:04:44,218 --> 00:04:46,451
Ha!
According to uncle,

79
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:48,353
strong enough to do
his research.

80
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:50,522
Hey, who knows?
Maybe this rat

81
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:53,725
is the heal-a-broken-leg
talisman. Hmm.

82
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:56,361
All tidy.
Not a toy in sight.

83
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:58,430
Gnomekop:
Must find turbo troll!

84
00:04:58,432 --> 00:05:00,999
Must find turbo tr--

85
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:02,534
[nervous laugh]

86
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:04,469
The power of the rat

87
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:07,606
brings motion
to the motionless.

88
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:08,707
Hmm...

89
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:09,775
Need anything?

90
00:05:09,777 --> 00:05:10,909
Uh, no. Thank you.

91
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:12,210
Warm up your tea?

92
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:17,015
I just need quiet
so I can concentrate.

93
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:18,417
I'll just fluff
your pillow.

94
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:19,484
Ooh!

95
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:20,686
Nice and fluffy.

96
00:05:20,688 --> 00:05:21,853
Uh, Jade,

97
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:23,522
I can take care
of myself.

98
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:27,693
Remember,
within every weakness
lies strength.

99
00:05:27,695 --> 00:05:29,394
Whatever you say,
Jackie.

100
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:32,564
Here. Let's just move
you a little closer
to the desk.

101
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:33,632
Oww!
Sorry!

102
00:05:33,634 --> 00:05:35,500
Waa-aah! Aah!

103
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:38,036
Jade: Sorry!

104
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,706
Turbo troll!

105
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,574
Towels! Towels!

106
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:52,718
Belt blaster!

107
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:57,723
Jade: You sure
you're ok?

108
00:05:57,725 --> 00:06:01,393
I'm fine. Ah,
where's the talisman?

109
00:06:01,395 --> 00:06:03,462
[Gasps]

110
00:06:03,464 --> 00:06:06,531
Man on p.A.: Full alert!
Intruder in the compound!

111
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:07,599
Full alert!

112
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:09,234
And when
we came back,

113
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:10,435
the lock was melted,

114
00:06:10,437 --> 00:06:12,204
and the talisman
was gone.

115
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:14,606
The dark hand--
they've located us.

116
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:17,242
Black to vault,
report!

117
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,380
Condition blue,
sir.

118
00:06:21,382 --> 00:06:26,051
The other talismans
are secure...So far.

119
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:27,953
This is all my fault, too.

120
00:06:27,955 --> 00:06:30,722
If I hadn't spilled
that stupid tea...

121
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,190
I'm gonna find--

122
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:33,692
gnomekop?!

123
00:06:33,694 --> 00:06:35,660
Must find turbo troll!

124
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:36,828
Whoa.

125
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,063
Who goes there?

126
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:40,298
You've never said
that before.

127
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,135
Come here, you.
Hey!

128
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,370
Jade!

129
00:06:45,372 --> 00:06:46,772
-Aah!
-Whoa!

130
00:06:46,774 --> 00:06:48,039
Leg, leg...

131
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:52,077
Jackie, something's
wrong with gnomekop.
He's--

132
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:55,981
please, Jade. I've had
all the gnomekop I want
for one day.

133
00:06:55,983 --> 00:06:58,049
-Jackie!
-Gnome power!

134
00:06:58,051 --> 00:06:59,885
Ohh!

135
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,554
Aah! Whoa!

136
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:07,292
I know where you live!

137
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:09,761
That toy should be
taken off the market.

138
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,563
I tried to tell you.

139
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:12,964
He's not just a toy
anymore.

140
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:15,033
He's alive! Alive!

141
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:17,536
Oh, what do you mean,
he's--

142
00:07:17,538 --> 00:07:20,539
[gasps]
Motion to the motionless.

143
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,808
Weird talisman
power, huh?

144
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:26,845
We found nothing
in the debris, master.

145
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:28,280
The rat talisman

146
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:31,616
is the key to
my freedom, valmont.

147
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:35,854
It will reanimate me
into flesh and blood.

148
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:37,722
Ooh. You mean
you'd get back

149
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:39,558
all your
dragon powers
and stuff.

150
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,395
No. Shendu
will still require
the other talismans

151
00:07:43,397 --> 00:07:47,499
and our continued
assistance for that.

152
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:49,701
Judging my experience,

153
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:53,572
I will remain in this
petrified state forever,

154
00:07:53,574 --> 00:07:55,707
and you will never
lay your eyes

155
00:07:55,709 --> 00:08:00,245
on the lost treasure
of ching shian.

156
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:01,513
2 words--

157
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:02,881
mouse hunt.

158
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:05,217
And the talisman
must've dropped inside

159
00:08:05,219 --> 00:08:09,154
and transformed the toy
into a living, breathing
thing.

160
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:11,156
Jackie, when you fell,

161
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:12,591
did you hit your head?

162
00:08:12,593 --> 00:08:15,093
Captain black,
look!

163
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:17,796
Yeah, he was
right behind you.

164
00:08:17,798 --> 00:08:21,299
Of course he was,
Jackie.

165
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:22,367
Jade, no!

166
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:25,737
Gotcha!
Unh!

167
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:28,974
[Embarrassed laugh]
Loose thread.

168

Must destroy turbo troll!

340
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:36,674
No! No!

341
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:38,042
No-o-o-o-o!

342
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:40,645
Run away!

343
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:44,815
We must retrieve
the talisman.

344
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:48,085
You're kidding,
right?

345
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:53,758
Jade: So while Jackie
distracted giant gnomekop,

346
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,826
I climbed up top,
crawled inside his mouth,

347
00:19:55,828 --> 00:19:57,862
and got the talisman.

348
00:19:57,864 --> 00:20:00,364
You did very well, Jade.

349
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:03,367
Yeah, except
for the part where
I slipped and fell off

350
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:04,635
and landed on Jackie.

351
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,170
Oh...

352
00:20:06,172 --> 00:20:07,371
Agreed.

353
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:08,539
Oh!

354
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:09,607
Puuh!

355
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:11,876
Jackie is young
and strong.

356
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:12,977
He will
heal quickly.

357
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:23,721
Hey, Jackie, have you
been seriously hurt
doing your own stunts?

358
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:28,459
Yes. So many times.
My eyes, my face,

359
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:29,560
shoulder...

360
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:30,695
Nose 3 times...

361
00:20:30,697 --> 00:20:31,996
Elbow, elbow...

362
00:20:31,998 --> 00:20:33,264
Cannot remember.

363
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:34,999
My jaws, knees, knees.

364
00:20:35,001 --> 00:20:36,801
Cut. Ankle, ankle.

365
00:20:36,803 --> 00:20:38,169
All of my teeth gone.

366
00:20:38,171 --> 00:20:41,305
I hurt. Cannot remember.
Cannot remember.

367
00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:43,608
But most important,
you remember.

368
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:46,010
Don't do any
dangerous stunt at home.

369
00:20:46,012 --> 00:20:48,012
Only in the movies.
