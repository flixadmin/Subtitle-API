1
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:04,375
There's a group of men
called The Firm.

2
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:09,791
They've been running things
for a long, long time.

3
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:14,375
And when they need someone
to clean up their mess...

4
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:17,083
...They send me.

5
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:56,158
Go get your helmet.
Let's go to the store.

6
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:59,666
You look so cute, Nit.

7
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:17,416
- Sam.
- Nathan.

8
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:21,875
- Where are you?
- At home. Sewing.

9
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:24,375
Meet me at the diner.

10
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,041
Why?

11
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:30,916
How much trouble am I in?

12
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:40,458
An extra scoop for my favorite client.

13
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:41,708
Thanks, Rose.

14
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,000
I put in an extra scoop
for my favorite client.

15
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:58,208
- Thanks, Rose,
- I'm sure she won't be long.

16
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:01,583
You clearly don't know
my mother very well.

17
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:17,125
Hey, stranger.

18
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:19,791
- Can I lighten your load?
- Not carrying today, Rose.

19
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:23,041
There's a first time for everything.
She's over there.

20
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:25,791
Thanks for keeping an eye on her.

21
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:50,583
You said you'd be here in 30 minutes.

22
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,500
I'm a few minutes late.

23
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,333
Three hours.

24
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:02,958
You're bleeding.

25
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:06,791
Just another day at the office.
Did you bring it?

26
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:17,791
Anna May sure can pick them.

27
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,541
- It's loaded.
- Good girl.

28
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:28,875
Listen, I, um...
have to disappear for a while.

29
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:32,833
- Then I'm coming with you.
- You can't. Not this time.

30
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,375
Nathan will be here soon.
He'll take care of you when I'm gone.

31
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:39,708
- I don't want to go with Nathan.
- I'm doing this for your own good.

32
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:41,958
I'll stay in the library
with Anna May and the others.

33
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:43,625
It's too dangerous.

34
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:48,583
What's going on?

35
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,125
It's... it's complicated.

36
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,750
Tell me.

37
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm not a kid any more.

38
00:04:58,458 --> 00:04:59,500
No, you're not.

39
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:13,041
You haven't touched your milkshake.

40
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:16,250
Didn't want to drink it without you.

41
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:55,541
How long will you be gone?

42
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:01,166
I have to make a quick phone call.

43
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:03,791
Stay here.

44
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,583
Evening, gentlemen.
Can I lighten your load?

45
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,125
- Get lost.
- Hey.

46
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,208
Hello, little girl.

47
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,666
Mommy says I'm not allowed
to talk to strangers.

48
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:04,166
This "Mommy" looks a lot like you.

49
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:08,416
Only bigger and more stabby.

50
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:12,333
Got my father's blood all over her.

51
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,666
I don't like you.

52
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:28,625
Enough games.

53
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:31,166
Where is she?

54
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:34,375
Go kiss a pig.

55
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:42,375
Tell me where she is.

56
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:50,750
Close your eyes, baby girl.

57
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:12,791
Mom!

58
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,666
Evening, darling.

59
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,833
- Can I lighten your load?
- I'm clean.

60
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:11,000
Regular clean or diner clean?

61
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,416
- Forgot about this one.
- Of course, sugar.

62
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,541
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

63
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:30,958
Boy.

64
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:34,541
Oh, these girls are worse than the Stasi.

65
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:36,916
You hurt?

66
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,500
Just another day at the office.

67
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,791
Wow, you sound just like your mother.

68
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:45,708
I don't have a mother.

69
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:48,375
Well, you sure have her temper.

70
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:51,208
What the hell happened tonight?

71
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,041
Bad intel.

72
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:56,000
You said four or five idiots
with peashooters.

73
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:57,416
Yes. And?

74
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:05,916
Oh, for Christ's sake, child.

75
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:09,916
This was supposed to be low-profile,
not a bloody massacre.

76
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,125
Next time, I'll just let them shoot me.

77
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:15,125
Next time, just do what you're told.

78
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:20,083
Remember who you're working for.
As long as they're happy...

79
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:23,750
You called me here oh-so-urgently
just to remind me of that?

80
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
No.

81
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:30,208
Your talents are needed, pronto.

82
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:33,208
Somebody stole from us.

83
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:37,750
Who's crazy enough to steal from The Firm?

84
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,375
Somebody who doesn't know
who we really are.

85
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:43,291
An accountant.
From the clean side of the business.

86
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:45,833
How much did he take?

87
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:47,791
Enough to earn a visit from you.

88
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:49,083
We need that money back.

89
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,208
Good girl.

90
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:54,625
I'll text you the address later.

91
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:58,166
Oh, and get rid of
those stone-age firearms you carry.

92
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:01,041
- I've had them for years.
- Find an open vendor.

93
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:03,833
And get yourself some clean boomsticks.

94
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:06,625
We can't have you linked
to that war zone you left behind, can we?

95
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:25,375
Did you know about this
little endeavor my son had on the side?

96
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:29,875
Sorry, Uncle. I had no idea.

97
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:56,375
Where's the shoe?

98
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:58,791
What shoe?

99
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:02,000
The shoe that is not currently covering
my son's left foot.

100
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:04,791
The one that looks like the right one.

101
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,083
That fucking shoe.

102
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:08,791
- I don't know.
- Well, find it.

103
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:18,375
Found it, Mr. McAlester.

104
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,458
Nobody tells his mother about this.

105
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:45,625
We'll tell her he ran off with some girl.

106
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:47,333
I get it.

107
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:51,333
Now, bring me the heads of the men
that killed my boy.

108
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Hello, dear.

109
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,791
What can I do for you?

110
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:41,041
I need to exchange some... books.

111
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,250
Well, that's nice.

112
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:46,625
Not a lot of people your age
read nowadays.

113
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,416
- Do you have a card with us?
- No.

114
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:51,166
I'd like to open one.

115
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:53,375
Wonderful.

116
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,875
What kind of... books
are you interested in?

117
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:58,208
Mostly smaller ones.

118
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:00,083
A few heavies.

119
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:02,375
Well, you won't find them there.

120
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:04,375
Those are our children's sections.

121
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:05,583
The Enchanted Forest...

122
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:08,958
and The Never-Ending Ocean.

123
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,208
They sound like fun.

124
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:16,708
Have we met before?

125
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,833
You seem so... familiar.

126
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:25,791
I'm embarrassed to say it's been a while
since I visited a library.

127
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:29,541
Well, that's no way to live, dear.

128
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:32,916
Let's get you into a good book.

129
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:34,833
Come.

130
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:10,416
Anna May, this lovely young lady
wants to open an account with us.

131
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,333
Well,

132
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:19,416
Madeleine should have told you
that we don't accept new readers

133
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,875
without a reference.

134
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:23,291
Madeleine had a hunch.

135
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:26,541
Fudge your hunches,
if you pardon my French.

136
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:29,375
- Technically not French.
- Always literal.

137
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:32,791
- Yes, I'm literary. I'm a librarian.
- Be that as it may.

138
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:34,791
Florence, dear.

139
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:36,208
Would you join us?

140
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:40,875
I'm afraid we need a tie-breaker.

141
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:44,750
Madeleine thinks this girl
needs to do some reading.

142
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,375
I told you I had a hunch.

143
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:48,291
There's something very familiar about her.

144
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:49,708
Hunch, smunch.

145
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:53,208
I, on the other hand,
think we should dispose of the body

146
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:56,875
and then have a long talk
about our onboarding protocols.

147
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:58,500
You know I can hear you, right?

148
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:01,625
Hush, girl.

149
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:03,375
Don't be rude.

150
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,041
Turn around, hon.

151
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,416
And take off your hat.

152
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:28,500
What did you say your name was?

153
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:29,666
She didn't.

154
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,375
Hmm. That's odd.

155
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:33,333
Well, girl?

156
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:36,625
Cat got your tongue? Speak up.

157
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:39,666
It's Sam.

158
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,291
Scarlet's kid.

159
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,083
Yeah.

160
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:48,000
I knew it. Never forget those eyes.

161
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:50,958
We haven't seen you
since you were yea high.

162
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:52,416
How is your mother?

163
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:55,250
Haven't seen her in 15 years.

164
00:16:57,541 --> 00:17:01,000
Well, that's something
we both have in common.

165
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:04,541
My, my, my. Little Sam.

166
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,708
We hear about you all the time.

167
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:10,666
You've made
quite a reputation for yourself.

168
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,166
Come here. Give Auntie Madeleine a hug.

169
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:18,750
Why come back now?

170
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:22,041
I needed clean guns...

171
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:26,041
and I guess I needed an excuse.

172
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,583
Nice collection.

173
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,333
And you take good care of them.

174
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:38,583
Let me guess. You're the sentimental type.

175
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:41,125
Ro-man-tique.

176
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:43,750
Sentimental types
don't last long doing this.

177
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:47,708
So, no. I don't think
I'm the sentimental type.

178
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:49,291
Tommy Tomahawk.

179
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:51,666
I looked everywhere for him.

180
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,541
Yeah, sorry about that.

181
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:55,666
So...

182
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:58,875
you're an idealist.

183
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:01,583
Nope. Maybe I don't have a type.

184
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:03,416
Everybody has a type.

185
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,000
- Everybody.
- Mm-hmm.

186
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,375
Maybe I'm the professional type?

187
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:09,541
Ah. Old school.

188
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:11,875
"No women, no children" type.

189
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,208
Women are fair game.

190
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:16,958
Gender equality.

191
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:19,000
Very progressive.

192
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:20,500
She's a feminist.

193
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:23,000
Fine.

194
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:24,791
You get to live.

195
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,416
We'll make these disappear

196
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,916
and get you into some new, clean books.

197
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:32,666
You'll need a Jane Austen.

198
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:36,333
A Charlotte Brontë.

199
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:39,833
And a Virginia Woolf.

200
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:45,458
Oh, and an Agatha Christie.

201
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,625
For reading.

202
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:11,708
Please.

203
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:15,541
I need to answer this.

204
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:20,375
You need to walk away
and thank God I'm not in a killing mood.

205
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:24,250
I got no choice.

206
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:30,833
- No!
- Enough!

207
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:03,541
Playing hard to get?

208
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:05,666
Not very smart, moron.

209
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:10,166
Not unless you want me to send
your little princess back in pieces.

210
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:12,375
You have exactly 60 minutes

211
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:15,208
to bring the money
to the Gutterball bowling alley.

212
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:17,625
A minute late, and she'll be celebrating

213
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:19,666
her ninth birthday with the worms.

214
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:21,833
60 minutes.

215
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:26,708
Please.

216
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:28,708
It's my daughter.

217
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,000
Fuck me.

218
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:37,625
I'll get the doctor.

219
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:40,125
Guns go in the cookie jar.

220
00:22:47,791 --> 00:22:50,416
- Hey. Haven't seen you in a while.
- Hmm.

221
00:22:51,416 --> 00:22:53,125
And you brought a new friend.

222
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:55,583
- What the hell happened?
- I happened.

223
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:56,916
Just fix him.

224
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,125
I need him on his feet in ten minutes.

225
00:23:05,458 --> 00:23:06,958
He's not going anywhere.

226
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:08,333
Not in ten minutes.

227
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,166
Maybe not ever.

228
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:12,291
- So what can we do?
- "We"?

229
00:23:13,166 --> 00:23:15,125
Well, you can start
by not shooting people.

230
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:17,625
Please. My Emily.

231
00:23:17,708 --> 00:23:19,333
- There's no time.
- Shh.

232
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:21,625
Just relax. Take it in deep.

233
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:23,250
Is that laughing gas?

234
00:23:23,875 --> 00:23:24,875
Well, duh.

235
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:26,750
Just patch him up.

236
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:28,500
I'll be back soon.

237
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:30,625
He'd better be functional.

238
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,541
She's quite annoying, isn't she?

239
00:23:40,916 --> 00:23:43,166
Who am I talking to?

240
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,250
The guy that she shot in the stomach?

241
00:23:51,708 --> 00:23:54,083
- Is it done?
- There's a change of plan.

242
00:23:54,916 --> 00:23:57,166
What are you talking about?
What does that mean?

243
00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:00,333
They kidnapped his little girl.
That's why he stole the money.

244
00:24:00,416 --> 00:24:03,291
If I'm not at the Gutterball
in 15 minutes, they'll kill her.

245
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:06,833
Sam, you're not thinking straight.
Just bring the money back, now!

246
00:24:06,916 --> 00:24:10,000
I just need half an hour.
I'll release her and bring the money.

247
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:13,750
Okay. Listen to me, Sam.

248
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,625
If you screw this one up,
they will give the kill order.

249
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:20,750
And I won't be able to stop them.

250
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:23,208
She's just a little girl.

251
00:24:23,291 --> 00:24:24,916
I can't leave her to die.

252
00:24:26,291 --> 00:24:28,625
- I'm sorry.
- Don't you dare hang up on me.

253
00:24:28,708 --> 00:24:29,958
- I'm sorry.
- Don't you...

254
00:24:30,041 --> 00:24:31,083
Fuck.

255
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:49,250
Go to the Gutterball.
Try to reason with her.

256
00:24:50,375 --> 00:24:51,416
Bring back the money.

257
00:24:53,083 --> 00:24:54,208
Wait.

258
00:24:57,583 --> 00:24:59,416
Now, when I say "reason with her,"

259
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,041
I mean no guns, no knives.

260
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:03,708
She comes back alive.

261
00:25:03,791 --> 00:25:06,208
- Understood?
- Yeah.

262
00:25:08,166 --> 00:25:09,208
And for God's sake...

263
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
be careful.

264
00:25:12,541 --> 00:25:14,166
Remember who you're dealing with.

265
00:25:17,708 --> 00:25:19,166
What are you waiting for? Go.

266
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:38,375
One of the men Sam killed
was Jim McAlester's son.

267
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:44,333
Are you sure
it was McAlester's kid?

268
00:25:44,416 --> 00:25:45,708
Yes.

269
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,666
The board is on its way.

270
00:25:58,791 --> 00:26:00,500
Goddammit, Sam.

271
00:26:35,875 --> 00:26:38,375
Who the fuck are you?

272
00:26:39,375 --> 00:26:42,000
Just someone who has your money.

273
00:26:42,625 --> 00:26:43,833
I want the girl.

274
00:26:43,916 --> 00:26:45,208
Where's Daddy?

275
00:26:46,291 --> 00:26:47,416
He...

276
00:26:48,083 --> 00:26:49,083
had an accident.

277
00:26:50,291 --> 00:26:51,333
He sent me.

278
00:26:53,875 --> 00:26:55,541
Do you want your money or not?

279
00:27:16,791 --> 00:27:19,416
The girl got to this point alive.

280
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,041
But if you as much as sneeze

281
00:27:21,125 --> 00:27:22,583
without my permission,

282
00:27:22,666 --> 00:27:25,250
that could be easily rectified.

283
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,083
- Got it.
- Good.

284
00:27:28,166 --> 00:27:30,625
Now, see the locker behind you?

285
00:27:34,583 --> 00:27:36,916
Weapon and phone go in the locker,

286
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,875
along with the clothes you're wearing.

287
00:27:38,958 --> 00:27:41,208
Slam the door shut, and it'll lock.

288
00:27:41,291 --> 00:27:44,208
Go to the Westfield Mall
across the street.

289
00:27:44,291 --> 00:27:46,708
You, the suitcase, the new clothes

290
00:27:46,791 --> 00:27:48,666
and the little girl's phone.

291
00:27:50,916 --> 00:27:52,416
Seriously?

292
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,708
Ten minutes.

293
00:28:14,166 --> 00:28:15,166
Hello, Sam.

294
00:28:17,458 --> 00:28:18,583
Bonehead.

295
00:28:19,166 --> 00:28:21,083
- Hey, Sam.
- Sam.

296
00:28:23,791 --> 00:28:25,041
Boneheads.

297
00:28:27,791 --> 00:28:31,416
- I really don't have time for this.
- Nathan's worried about you.

298
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,916
Doesn't want you to do anything stupid.

299
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,500
So why don't you hand over the suitcase,

300
00:28:38,208 --> 00:28:39,291
and nobody gets hurt.

301
00:28:39,375 --> 00:28:44,208
Counter-offer: Go back to Nathan,
tell him you tried, but I roughed you up.

302
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:48,916
You can beat each other up
for added realism.

303
00:28:50,125 --> 00:28:51,750
- That's funny.
- What?

304
00:28:51,833 --> 00:28:53,791
No guns today?

305
00:28:53,875 --> 00:28:55,791
Nathan doesn't want you hurt.

306
00:28:57,083 --> 00:28:58,666
Not too badly, anyway.

307
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:00,958
Oh, that is so sweet.

308
00:29:02,583 --> 00:29:04,625
I'll try not to kill you, too.

309
00:29:57,291 --> 00:29:59,333
Who the fuck is she?

310
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,458
Ground floor. Video Beast.

311
00:32:43,208 --> 00:32:44,541
Cutting it close.

312
00:32:45,291 --> 00:32:46,583
I had a few hiccups.

313
00:32:46,666 --> 00:32:50,416
We saw what you did with those hiccups.
How do we know you're not a cop?

314
00:32:51,083 --> 00:32:53,000
Can a cop do what I just did?

315
00:32:54,166 --> 00:32:55,291
I just want the girl.

316
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:58,833
Then we'll get along just fine.

317
00:32:58,916 --> 00:33:00,750
There's a shopping cart behind you.

318
00:33:02,166 --> 00:33:03,833
Put the suitcase inside.

319
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,750
Push the shopping cart towards us,

320
00:33:13,833 --> 00:33:16,208
and we'll push the girl cart towards you.

321
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,041
One.

322
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:22,791
Two.

323
00:33:25,083 --> 00:33:26,458
Three.

324
00:33:36,583 --> 00:33:37,916
It's okay. You're safe.

325
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,875
I'll be right back.

326
00:33:46,208 --> 00:33:49,666
We're all stinking rich,
you magnificent bastards.

327
00:33:50,208 --> 00:33:51,916
Stop the fucking car.

328
00:33:52,416 --> 00:33:53,708
Holy fuck!

329
00:34:16,333 --> 00:34:18,583
You greedy traitor!

330
00:34:37,416 --> 00:34:39,125
No... no!

331
00:34:39,208 --> 00:34:40,250
No, no, no!

332
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,500
Fuck.

333
00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:34,541
Anything broken?

334
00:35:34,625 --> 00:35:36,250
- Are you bleeding?
- No.

335
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:38,000
Bleeding on the inside?

336
00:35:38,708 --> 00:35:39,875
How can you tell?

337
00:35:40,541 --> 00:35:41,708
It's inside.

338
00:35:42,791 --> 00:35:44,833
You're probably fine. Let's go.

339
00:35:45,708 --> 00:35:47,000
Try to keep up.

340
00:35:59,541 --> 00:36:02,666
I see you morons have found my stash.

341
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:04,750
This is some good shit, doc.

342
00:36:04,833 --> 00:36:06,958
You should be very proud of yourself.

343
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,125
This is not a toy.

344
00:36:11,208 --> 00:36:13,250
It's for medicinal use only.

345
00:36:21,708 --> 00:36:22,791
So...

346
00:36:23,791 --> 00:36:25,625
who fucked you up like this?

347
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,250
A girl.

348
00:36:33,166 --> 00:36:36,416
A girl made you look
like you're from The Walking Dead?

349
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,583
I've never felt
pain like this before, doc.

350
00:36:39,458 --> 00:36:41,416
She got us good, doc. I...

351
00:36:42,583 --> 00:36:44,208
I don't think I'll ever walk again.

352
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:47,250
There must be an epidemic,

353
00:36:47,333 --> 00:36:50,291
'cause I got a guy in the next room
who's got similar symptoms.

354
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,291
What do you mean?

355
00:36:52,375 --> 00:36:53,583
I mean...

356
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:57,083
a girl fucked him up, too.

357
00:37:01,916 --> 00:37:03,791
Keep talking, doc.

358
00:37:04,583 --> 00:37:06,666
You're bleeding.

359
00:37:08,083 --> 00:37:09,416
It's just a scratch.

360
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,166
It can get infected.

361
00:37:12,083 --> 00:37:16,166
Worms will get in there and lay eggs.
Then they'll have to cut your arm off.

362
00:37:18,583 --> 00:37:20,541
That's what they teach in school
these days?

363
00:37:21,125 --> 00:37:22,125
Discovery Channel.

364
00:37:22,875 --> 00:37:25,166
Thank God we're going straight
to the hospital.

365
00:37:25,791 --> 00:37:26,791
Is my daddy there?

366
00:37:29,125 --> 00:37:30,208
Yeah.

367
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:32,875
Is that why he didn't come?

368
00:37:33,625 --> 00:37:34,708
Is he sick?

369
00:37:35,708 --> 00:37:36,708
He...

370
00:37:37,916 --> 00:37:39,083
It's okay.

371
00:37:39,166 --> 00:37:41,166
You don't have to lie for him.

372
00:37:42,041 --> 00:37:44,250
He never comes when he says he will.

373
00:37:51,583 --> 00:37:54,458
Here, just let me help you.

374
00:37:58,708 --> 00:37:59,708
Thank you.

375
00:38:02,708 --> 00:38:03,708
Sure.

376
00:38:05,833 --> 00:38:07,166
Are you sure it's her?

377
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:09,625
Yeah. She dropped off
some guy she shot.

378
00:38:09,708 --> 00:38:12,375
Said she's going to come back
and pick him up later.

379
00:38:12,458 --> 00:38:14,208
And the money?

380
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:17,375
She had it last time we saw her.

381
00:38:17,958 --> 00:38:19,375
Then get it back.

382
00:38:19,458 --> 00:38:22,333
She's still getting the VIP treatment?

383
00:38:31,541 --> 00:38:34,458
- Do whatever it takes.
- Alright, alright, alright.

384
00:38:34,541 --> 00:38:37,250
Now that's what I call a work benefit.

385
00:38:51,416 --> 00:38:53,541
Just, uh, stay behind me, okay?

386
00:39:14,958 --> 00:39:16,083
Come on.

387
00:40:09,875 --> 00:40:11,125
I'll get the doctor.

388
00:40:25,166 --> 00:40:26,250
She's here.

389
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:28,916
Shot in the shoulder.

390
00:40:34,541 --> 00:40:36,625
Maybe you should take your break now.

391
00:40:44,291 --> 00:40:46,125
So. My payment?

392
00:40:49,666 --> 00:40:51,333
Transferred to your account.

393
00:40:52,375 --> 00:40:53,375
Now...

394
00:40:53,833 --> 00:40:55,458
What's the plan, doc?

395
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:03,166
Once I stick her with this,
she'll start losing control of her arms.

396
00:41:04,833 --> 00:41:06,666
After 60 seconds or so...

397
00:41:07,875 --> 00:41:09,083
she's a sitting duck.

398
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,250
What's wrong with you?
Let me do this right.

399
00:41:31,333 --> 00:41:33,166
It's just a scratch.

400
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:34,791
Well, scratches get infected.

401
00:41:34,875 --> 00:41:36,375
That's how you lose an arm.

402
00:41:37,125 --> 00:41:39,625
Mm. Yeah, I heard.

403
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,583
What happened to him?

404
00:41:46,916 --> 00:41:48,125
Someone shot him.

405
00:41:48,208 --> 00:41:50,333
I hear that's pretty lethal.

406
00:41:51,875 --> 00:41:53,458
Let's fix this.

407
00:41:53,541 --> 00:41:55,458
Don't. I'm good.

408
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:58,125
Trust me, you'll need this.

409
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:01,125
I said, I'm good.

410
00:42:04,166 --> 00:42:05,458
I'm sorry, I didn't mean...

411
00:42:09,458 --> 00:42:11,916
You motherfu...

412
00:42:12,625 --> 00:42:14,916
60 seconds!

413
00:42:16,125 --> 00:42:17,833
60 seconds!

414
00:42:24,916 --> 00:42:26,666
60 seconds.

415
00:42:27,916 --> 00:42:30,166
Oh, come on. Come on!

416
00:42:34,083 --> 00:42:36,208
Listen, I need your help.

417
00:42:37,083 --> 00:42:39,250
Some bad men are coming to hurt us.

418
00:42:39,916 --> 00:42:41,333
Those who killed my dad?

419
00:42:41,416 --> 00:42:44,375
I promise I'll explain,
but right now I need your help, okay?

420
00:42:44,458 --> 00:42:45,875
- Okay.
- Good.

421
00:42:45,958 --> 00:42:47,416
Grab the biggest knife.

422
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:49,791
Careful of the sharp end.

423
00:42:53,125 --> 00:42:54,375
Okay...

424
00:42:54,458 --> 00:42:55,458
Now grab the tape.

425
00:42:59,375 --> 00:43:01,208
Excellent. Tape it to my hand.

426
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:06,916
36...

427
00:43:09,333 --> 00:43:10,708
32...

428
00:43:19,708 --> 00:43:21,666
Now tape the gun to my other hand.

429
00:43:23,208 --> 00:43:24,583
Careful. It's loaded.

430
00:43:25,333 --> 00:43:27,541
15... 14...

431
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:32,833
Round two, bitch.

432
00:43:35,208 --> 00:43:36,291
Boneheads?

433
00:43:36,375 --> 00:43:39,291
Better get ready!

434
00:43:39,375 --> 00:43:41,833
Oh, thank God it's just you three.

435
00:43:41,916 --> 00:43:44,750
For a second there,
I thought it was someone dangerous.

436
00:43:45,625 --> 00:43:49,125
The only reason you're still alive
is 'cause Nathan wanted it that way.

437
00:43:50,458 --> 00:43:53,333
Now, take my finger
and put it on the trigger.

438
00:43:53,416 --> 00:43:55,166
Well, it's over now.

439
00:43:55,708 --> 00:43:58,125
I'm going to tear you into little pieces.

440
00:43:58,625 --> 00:44:01,666
And I'm gonna love every second of it.

441
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:03,000
Great. Hold that thought.

442
00:44:03,625 --> 00:44:05,166
I'll be right out.

443
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:17,583
You're being very brave, Emily.

444
00:44:18,166 --> 00:44:20,416
I need you to do one last thing for me,

445
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:22,458
and then go and hide, okay?

446
00:44:23,875 --> 00:44:24,916
Okay.

447
00:46:49,375 --> 00:46:51,125
Hey, Bonehead.

448
00:47:27,458 --> 00:47:28,458
Emily.

449
00:47:31,416 --> 00:47:33,708
I need you to come grab the phone.

450
00:47:48,416 --> 00:47:49,833
Come on.

451
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,125
It's okay. Just pick it up.

452
00:48:02,916 --> 00:48:06,083
You are a goddamn rock star.

453
00:48:06,166 --> 00:48:07,500
Put it on speaker.

454
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:11,750
Someone better start talking.

455
00:48:11,833 --> 00:48:12,833
That was a...

456
00:48:14,125 --> 00:48:17,916
jerk move,
sending the Three Stooges after me.

457
00:48:19,041 --> 00:48:21,500
You left us no choice, Sam.

458
00:48:21,583 --> 00:48:22,875
There's always a choice.

459
00:48:22,958 --> 00:48:25,291
Oh, well, then,
we can still figure this out.

460
00:48:25,375 --> 00:48:27,208
Just bring the money back.

461
00:48:27,291 --> 00:48:30,583
It's gone. The suitcase
was blown to 1000 pieces.

462
00:48:38,875 --> 00:48:40,458
That's really unfortunate.

463
00:48:41,833 --> 00:48:43,166
So now what?

464
00:48:43,916 --> 00:48:45,875
Oh, you know the drill, Sam.

465
00:48:45,958 --> 00:48:47,875
You're no longer under our protection.

466
00:48:49,666 --> 00:48:52,416
In your little massacre
earlier tonight,

467
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:54,500
you killed the wrong people.

468
00:48:54,583 --> 00:48:57,000
Including Jim McAlester's son.

469
00:48:58,541 --> 00:48:59,916
But I was sent by you.

470
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:01,791
By The Firm.

471
00:49:01,875 --> 00:49:03,291
It doesn't matter.

472
00:49:06,958 --> 00:49:08,750
This is business, Sam.

473
00:49:09,583 --> 00:49:12,291
And you landed on the wrong side
of the balance sheet.

474
00:49:13,083 --> 00:49:14,208
So...

475
00:49:15,875 --> 00:49:17,750
It needs to be rectified.

476
00:49:20,833 --> 00:49:22,750
How's this for business?

477
00:49:24,125 --> 00:49:25,833
If I get out of this alive,

478
00:49:26,708 --> 00:49:28,375
I'm coming for you.

479
00:49:30,458 --> 00:49:31,541
All of you.

480
00:49:33,416 --> 00:49:35,083
I would expect no less.

481
00:49:37,375 --> 00:49:38,666
Goodbye, Sam.

482
00:50:04,583 --> 00:50:07,541
- Yes?
- Mr. McAlester, this is Nathan.

483
00:50:07,625 --> 00:50:10,291
I'm the head of the HR department
here at The Firm.

484
00:50:10,375 --> 00:50:11,583
What do you want?

485
00:50:11,666 --> 00:50:14,916
To prevent an all-out war
between our two fine organizations,

486
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,208
we would like to offer you
the woman responsible for your loss.

487
00:50:19,291 --> 00:50:21,541
So you had nothing to do with this?

488
00:50:21,625 --> 00:50:25,000
I can assure you, this is not how The Firm
conducts its business, sir.

489
00:50:25,083 --> 00:50:29,666
It was an unsolicited action
by a very troubled individual.

490
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:31,958
Now, I'm sending you her last location.

491
00:50:32,541 --> 00:50:35,500
I hope this is satisfactory, sir.

492
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:37,458
For now.

493
00:50:40,041 --> 00:50:41,625
Take everybody.

494
00:50:42,166 --> 00:50:44,125
Don't come back until it's done.

495
00:51:10,375 --> 00:51:13,208
- It's a text message from Nathan.
- What's it say?

496
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,750
"I'm sorry, child.
I can no longer protect you."

497
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:22,166
"I left you a package to help you
survive the next few days."

498
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:24,541
"Take it, and disappear."

499
00:51:25,958 --> 00:51:27,375
Then there's an address.

500
00:51:28,791 --> 00:51:30,166
That's close by.

501
00:51:31,666 --> 00:51:33,000
What if it's a trap?

502
00:51:48,541 --> 00:51:51,791
Can you press the button?
We're parked on minus two.

503
00:52:18,541 --> 00:52:20,875
Just remember, you were spared

504
00:52:20,958 --> 00:52:23,000
thanks to an eight-year-old girl.

505
00:52:23,083 --> 00:52:24,916
Eight and three quarters.

506
00:52:27,333 --> 00:52:28,500
Sorry.

507
00:52:29,041 --> 00:52:30,625
Eight and three quarters.

508
00:52:41,875 --> 00:52:43,416
Are you a serial killer?

509
00:52:44,958 --> 00:52:45,958
What?

510
00:52:47,458 --> 00:52:50,166
No...
Where did you learn that expression?

511
00:52:50,791 --> 00:52:52,750
- History Channel.
- Well...

512
00:52:53,666 --> 00:52:55,625
I am not a serial killer.

513
00:52:55,708 --> 00:52:57,875
But... you kill people?

514
00:52:58,458 --> 00:52:59,833
Yes.

515
00:52:59,916 --> 00:53:01,833
So that makes you a killer.

516
00:53:01,916 --> 00:53:03,875
And you've killed more than one.

517
00:53:03,958 --> 00:53:05,333
That is serial.

518
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:08,250
It's...

519
00:53:08,333 --> 00:53:10,000
It's more complicated than that.

520
00:53:10,833 --> 00:53:14,375
Serial killers are, uh,
you know, mentally unstable.

521
00:53:14,458 --> 00:53:16,791
They kill people out of a compulsive urge.

522
00:53:19,583 --> 00:53:21,041
So, why do you kill them?

523
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:25,083
For money?

524
00:53:26,416 --> 00:53:28,041
Again, it's, uh...

525
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:30,708
It's complicated.

526
00:53:33,458 --> 00:53:36,291
Look, I'm going to need your help
for a little longer.

527
00:53:36,375 --> 00:53:38,000
Because your arms are still paralyzed?

528
00:53:38,083 --> 00:53:40,125
Yes. After that,
I'll get you to your mother.

529
00:53:40,208 --> 00:53:41,708
She left a long time ago.

530
00:53:41,791 --> 00:53:43,916
- To your grandparents, then.
- They're dead.

531
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,250
Uncles? Anything?

532
00:53:55,875 --> 00:53:57,916
We'll figure it out, okay?

533
00:53:59,583 --> 00:54:00,583
Okay.

534
00:54:01,416 --> 00:54:04,000
So, here's an unrelated question.

535
00:54:05,416 --> 00:54:06,708
Do you know how to drive?

536
00:54:08,125 --> 00:54:10,250
Let's go over it
one more time. Left.

537
00:54:11,166 --> 00:54:12,208
Right.

538
00:54:12,291 --> 00:54:13,875
Yes, I've got it already.

539
00:54:13,958 --> 00:54:16,208
"D" is for drive. "R" is for reverse.

540
00:54:16,291 --> 00:54:19,458
And you get to do the easy part,
stepping on the gas and breaks.

541
00:54:20,125 --> 00:54:22,458
Don't be a smart-ass. Turn the key.

542
00:54:24,416 --> 00:54:25,750
Put it in drive.

543
00:54:27,166 --> 00:54:28,375
Let's go.

544
00:54:48,041 --> 00:54:49,791
That's it. Straighten up.

545
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:53,041
I'm driving.

546
00:54:53,625 --> 00:54:54,708
Yes, you are.

547
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:05,170
Don't worry about the bullets.

548
00:55:06,416 --> 00:55:07,708
Reverse. Now.

549
00:55:09,791 --> 00:55:12,208
Hard left!

550
00:55:14,666 --> 00:55:16,291
- Put it in drive.
- Yeah.

551
00:55:18,541 --> 00:55:19,875
That's it.

552
00:55:21,666 --> 00:55:23,125
Hard left.

553
00:55:23,208 --> 00:55:24,708
Go, go, go.

554
00:55:28,708 --> 00:55:29,708
Damn it!

555
00:55:30,208 --> 00:55:31,791
Get ready. Hard left.

556
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:34,833
And another hard left.

557
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:52,041
Okay. Put it in reverse.

558
00:55:56,208 --> 00:55:58,583
Hard right!

559
00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:01,625
Put it in drive.

560
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,291
Hard left.

561
00:56:09,125 --> 00:56:10,958
Put it in reverse.

562
00:56:12,875 --> 00:56:15,083
Okay, kill the lights!

563
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:41,750
Okay, be quiet. Duck down.

564
00:56:41,833 --> 00:56:43,708
That's it. Get down.

565
00:56:55,166 --> 00:56:58,000
Okay. Put it in drive...

566
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:00,875
and close your eyes.

567
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,333
Keep her straight.

568
00:57:21,791 --> 00:57:22,791
Keep it straight.

569
00:57:30,125 --> 00:57:31,625
Are your eyes still closed?

570
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:33,541
- Yes.
- Good girl.

571
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:35,375
Put it in reverse.

572
00:58:02,083 --> 00:58:03,833
Can I turn on the radio?

573
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:06,250
Go nuts.

574
00:59:03,916 --> 00:59:06,166
Emily, doorbell.

575
00:59:28,541 --> 00:59:30,791
Didn't I teach you
to always guard your back?

576
00:59:41,458 --> 00:59:42,833
Hi, Mom.

577
00:59:44,333 --> 00:59:45,416
Hi.

578
00:59:55,083 --> 00:59:56,500
Is this, um...

579
00:59:58,958 --> 00:59:59,958
Am I a grandmother?

580
01:00:01,125 --> 01:00:02,291
God, no.

581
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Hi. I'm Emily.

582
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:10,958
- I'm her apprentice.
- What?

583
01:00:11,041 --> 01:00:12,125
Emily.

584
01:00:12,625 --> 01:00:13,833
Come.

585
01:00:22,666 --> 01:00:25,583
...the additional burden
of needing to care

586
01:00:25,666 --> 01:00:27,708
for her twelve-month-old daughter.

587
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:29,166
It will be at least a year...

588
01:00:35,958 --> 01:00:38,333
That is a hell of a story.

589
01:00:39,833 --> 01:00:41,625
Mm. Hell of a night.

590
01:00:43,916 --> 01:00:46,375
Um... Try wiggling your fingers.

591
01:00:47,041 --> 01:00:49,833
- Feeling should come back in no time.
- Yeah, it's already working.

592
01:00:49,916 --> 01:00:51,291
Excellent.

593
01:00:55,416 --> 01:00:57,541
You look really good. Are you eating well?

594
01:00:57,625 --> 01:00:58,791
Cut the crap, Ma.

595
01:01:00,625 --> 01:01:02,708
Where have you been for the last 15 years?

596
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,083
Around.

597
01:01:08,375 --> 01:01:09,500
Watching you.

598
01:01:12,041 --> 01:01:13,666
Making sure you're safe.

599
01:01:14,333 --> 01:01:15,625
Great parenting.

600
01:01:16,250 --> 01:01:18,458
Glad to see you taking an interest
in my career.

601
01:01:18,541 --> 01:01:21,791
- I never wanted this life for you.
- How's that working out for you?

602
01:01:26,708 --> 01:01:29,916
I wanted to stay with you
and your aunts, but I couldn't.

603
01:01:30,666 --> 01:01:31,916
Why not?

604
01:01:34,875 --> 01:01:36,166
Because I fucked up.

605
01:01:42,125 --> 01:01:43,458
I fucked up.

606
01:01:45,458 --> 01:01:47,125
I was young when I had you.

607
01:01:49,041 --> 01:01:51,666
We left London, followed your father here.
When he died...

608
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:53,541
When he was murdered.

609
01:01:55,916 --> 01:01:58,708
When he was murdered,
you were a baby. I had nothing.

610
01:01:59,791 --> 01:02:01,416
No money, nowhere to go.

611
01:02:02,458 --> 01:02:04,458
I knew Anna May from your dad's work.

612
01:02:06,041 --> 01:02:08,250
She and the other aunts took us in.

613
01:02:09,416 --> 01:02:11,291
The best years of my life.

614
01:02:11,375 --> 01:02:12,875
Me too.

615
01:02:16,708 --> 01:02:20,000
Fast-forward twelve years,
and I find out who shot your dad.

616
01:02:21,583 --> 01:02:22,875
The Russians?

617
01:02:23,708 --> 01:02:25,416
The Russians from the diner?

618
01:02:25,958 --> 01:02:29,375
Once I knew, I couldn't let him
walk around enjoying life...

619
01:02:31,208 --> 01:02:32,750
knowing what he did to us.

620
01:02:34,916 --> 01:02:38,416
But he was in bed with The Firm,
so there was a price to pay.

621
01:02:39,875 --> 01:02:42,250
Once I killed him,
there was a mark on my back.

622
01:02:49,291 --> 01:02:51,750
I couldn't take you with me.

623
01:02:54,208 --> 01:02:55,708
I couldn't risk your life.

624
01:02:59,208 --> 01:03:01,458
So I made Nathan promise to keep you safe.

625
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:07,125
I guess that's over.

626
01:03:10,416 --> 01:03:13,916
There isn't a day that goes by
I don't regret pulling that trigger.

627
01:03:14,416 --> 01:03:16,625
But back then, I couldn't help myself.

628
01:03:21,208 --> 01:03:22,458
I'm sorry.

629
01:03:35,041 --> 01:03:37,333
Does the kid know about you and her dad?

630
01:03:37,416 --> 01:03:38,416
No.

631
01:03:40,833 --> 01:03:42,166
But she's smart.

632
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:44,666
She'll figure it out.

633
01:03:45,625 --> 01:03:47,125
What happens when she does?

634
01:04:04,416 --> 01:04:06,375
I think there's a bad man outside.

635
01:04:12,375 --> 01:04:13,708
We have to get out of here.

636
01:04:18,791 --> 01:04:21,583
- So, what's the plan?
- Can you press the lobby button?

637
01:04:21,666 --> 01:04:24,125
- What plan?
- Come on, you always have a plan.

638
01:04:24,208 --> 01:04:26,833
A secret escape route?
A warehouse filled with guns?

639
01:04:26,916 --> 01:04:27,958
I called us an Uber.

640
01:04:28,041 --> 01:04:29,500
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

641
01:04:29,583 --> 01:04:31,708
An Uber.
What the hell are you talking about?

642
01:04:31,791 --> 01:04:33,541
I know you. You make plans.

643
01:04:33,625 --> 01:04:35,791
And then you make plans
to make other plans.

644
01:04:35,875 --> 01:04:38,875
You're frothing at the mouth.

645
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:40,458
It's unbecoming.

646
01:05:01,333 --> 01:05:02,708
Get them!

647
01:05:08,166 --> 01:05:09,541
Don't feel bad.

648
01:05:10,041 --> 01:05:11,541
Could happen to anyone.

649
01:05:11,625 --> 01:05:13,333
My hand is still paralyzed.

650
01:05:13,416 --> 01:05:14,958
Yeah, course it is.

651
01:05:15,041 --> 01:05:16,875
- It is.
- I know.

652
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:30,458
Right. After you, ladies.

653
01:05:31,208 --> 01:05:33,041
Come on. Hurry up.

654
01:05:33,708 --> 01:05:35,708
- Where does it go?
- Fucking Narnia.

655
01:05:35,791 --> 01:05:36,791
Go. In.

656
01:05:37,291 --> 01:05:38,958
- In!
- Fine.

657
01:05:51,916 --> 01:05:54,958
- No plan, huh?
- Now is not the time.

658
01:05:55,916 --> 01:05:57,166
Out of my way.

659
01:06:02,708 --> 01:06:04,916
- Need help, Ma?
- No, thank you.

660
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,208
I'm quite capable...

661
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:10,000
of disposing of one...

662
01:06:10,083 --> 01:06:11,166
...idiotic grate.

663
01:06:47,541 --> 01:06:51,000
That freezer is a mess.
It's completely unacceptable.

664
01:07:01,166 --> 01:07:03,333
- Come on.
- Are you kidding me?

665
01:07:03,875 --> 01:07:05,625
- We have to go.
- Go where?

666
01:07:05,708 --> 01:07:07,625
Obviously your plan was to end up here.

667
01:07:07,708 --> 01:07:09,708
- That was a long time ago.
- Mom...

668
01:07:10,458 --> 01:07:12,416
- I'm not going in there.
- Mom, listen.

669
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:14,916
We need weapons and a car.
We need a safe house!

670
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,291
I'm not sure they'd let me in!

671
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:19,041
Only one way to find out.

672
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:29,875
Hey.

673
01:07:45,041 --> 01:07:47,625
For the record,
I still think this is a shit idea.

674
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:02,458
Madeleine?

675
01:08:08,791 --> 01:08:11,791
Girls, I think I see a ghost.

676
01:08:16,708 --> 01:08:19,041
- Hi, Madeleine.
- Hi, Scarlet.

677
01:08:19,125 --> 01:08:20,291
Florence.

678
01:08:22,750 --> 01:08:24,458
- Hi, Anna May.
- No.

679
01:08:25,125 --> 01:08:27,166
No, no. You don't get to talk.

680
01:08:28,291 --> 01:08:30,958
Because you're a ghost,
and ghosts can't talk.

681
01:08:31,458 --> 01:08:32,708
You know how I know that?

682
01:08:33,291 --> 01:08:34,666
Can we do this later?

683
01:08:34,750 --> 01:08:36,291
Because if ghosts could talk,

684
01:08:37,166 --> 01:08:39,875
they would say something
before disappearing.

685
01:08:39,958 --> 01:08:43,083
Or at least leave a note. But they can't.

686
01:08:43,166 --> 01:08:45,833
So, ipso facto, you're a ghost.

687
01:08:46,666 --> 01:08:48,250
- I'm sorry.
- Fuck you.

688
01:08:48,333 --> 01:08:50,666
Language, Anna May.
There's a child present.

689
01:08:50,750 --> 01:08:52,041
Fine.

690
01:08:53,041 --> 01:08:55,583
- Fudge you.
- Fudge you.

691
01:08:55,666 --> 01:08:57,625
Fudge you!

692
01:09:01,750 --> 01:09:04,916
And why is there a toddler
in our place of business?

693
01:09:06,708 --> 01:09:07,708
The short version?

694
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:09,500
Please.

695
01:09:10,125 --> 01:09:13,000
Her father was killed
and she has nowhere else to go.

696
01:09:13,083 --> 01:09:14,708
I was downsized by The Firm,

697
01:09:14,791 --> 01:09:18,083
and they fed me to McAlester's
endless supply of thugs.

698
01:09:18,166 --> 01:09:19,791
And you decided to come here?

699
01:09:19,875 --> 01:09:21,708
Shall we return
at a more convenient time?

700
01:09:22,291 --> 01:09:23,541
Maybe you should.

701
01:09:23,625 --> 01:09:26,000
It seems like
whenever you come here,

702
01:09:26,083 --> 01:09:27,708
you bring a war with you.

703
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,125
Bring your problems...

704
01:09:32,750 --> 01:09:34,125
We need to table this.

705
01:09:37,875 --> 01:09:39,041
Seconded.

706
01:09:39,583 --> 01:09:40,750
Let's go down.

707
01:09:58,916 --> 01:10:00,291
Go and take Emily.

708
01:10:00,791 --> 01:10:02,291
I'll buy us some time.

709
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:07,041
I think I should stay.

710
01:10:09,333 --> 01:10:10,458
No.

711
01:10:11,041 --> 01:10:12,541
I screwed this up.

712
01:10:13,041 --> 01:10:15,333
I'll clean up my own mess.

713
01:10:16,041 --> 01:10:18,666
We'll meet at the diner
once I've finished them off.

714
01:10:19,583 --> 01:10:21,958
Go.

715
01:10:22,041 --> 01:10:23,208
Please.

716
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:26,541
Come.

717
01:10:29,125 --> 01:10:31,708
Are you sure?
I could use the target practice.

718
01:10:33,291 --> 01:10:34,541
Anna May was right.

719
01:10:35,916 --> 01:10:37,958
I shouldn't have dragged you into this.

720
01:10:47,333 --> 01:10:49,750
I'm staying with you.

721
01:10:50,250 --> 01:10:52,041
No. No, you're not.

722
01:10:52,125 --> 01:10:54,875
You're going to the basement,
where it's safe.

723
01:10:54,958 --> 01:10:57,458
But you need me. I'm your apprentice.

724
01:10:57,541 --> 01:10:59,291
Okay, listen, Emily.

725
01:10:59,375 --> 01:11:02,750
The bad men are coming.
I really need you to go with my mom.

726
01:11:02,833 --> 01:11:05,333
No! I want to stay with you.

727
01:11:05,416 --> 01:11:06,708
- You can't.
- But why?

728
01:11:06,791 --> 01:11:08,291
Because...

729
01:11:12,791 --> 01:11:14,500
Because I killed your father.

730
01:11:16,250 --> 01:11:19,291
You're lying.
You just want to get rid of me.

731
01:11:21,875 --> 01:11:23,291
Your dad, he, um...

732
01:11:24,291 --> 01:11:26,500
He stole from some very bad people.

733
01:11:28,083 --> 01:11:29,166
And they hired me.

734
01:11:31,666 --> 01:11:32,875
And I shot him.

735
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:47,083
Come on. Let's go.

736
01:11:56,250 --> 01:11:57,500
I need weapons.

737
01:11:57,583 --> 01:11:59,250
Try the self-help section.

738
01:12:32,958 --> 01:12:35,541
- I have to help her.
- You need my permission?

739
01:12:35,625 --> 01:12:38,333
- I can't bail on her again.
- Why? You're good at it.

740
01:12:38,416 --> 01:12:42,333
I'm sorry I couldn't give it up back then
and just stay here with you.

741
01:12:51,916 --> 01:12:53,250
You're human.

742
01:12:54,041 --> 01:12:55,458
You screwed up.

743
01:12:55,541 --> 01:12:59,041
I can only imagine
how painful it was leaving her behind.

744
01:13:12,083 --> 01:13:13,625
Leaving us all behind.

745
01:13:15,125 --> 01:13:17,291
But she grew up to be a fine woman.

746
01:13:25,333 --> 01:13:27,250
I never wanted this life for her.

747
01:13:34,541 --> 01:13:35,958
Maybe it was meant to be.

748
01:13:36,041 --> 01:13:38,958
Or maybe she wanted to be
just like her mother.

749
01:13:49,458 --> 01:13:50,583
I missed you.

750
01:14:01,250 --> 01:14:03,083
We kept these ladies for you.

751
01:14:09,583 --> 01:14:11,750
Just meet us at the diner.

752
01:14:11,833 --> 01:14:13,583
Come back in one piece, okay?

753
01:14:14,708 --> 01:14:16,083
Both of you.

754
01:15:30,541 --> 01:15:31,791
Motherfucker!

755
01:16:17,166 --> 01:16:18,708
Is anything broken?

756
01:16:18,791 --> 01:16:20,333
- Are you bleeding?
- I'm fine.

757
01:16:20,416 --> 01:16:21,875
Bleeding on the inside?

758
01:16:23,625 --> 01:16:25,166
The rest of them are coming.

759
01:16:25,250 --> 01:16:27,208
Would it kill you to say thank you?

760
01:16:28,333 --> 01:16:30,625
You can still go, Ma. I'll cover you.

761
01:16:31,291 --> 01:16:33,541
And miss all the fun?

762
01:16:39,625 --> 01:16:41,208
Women Who Run with the Wolves.

763
01:16:43,250 --> 01:16:45,541
- Awakening the Giant Within.
- Ammo?

764
01:16:45,625 --> 01:16:47,583
How to Win Friends and Influence People.

765
01:17:06,166 --> 01:17:08,625
You should've stayed away
from this line of work.

766
01:17:08,708 --> 01:17:10,291
Are you kidding, Ma?

767
01:17:11,458 --> 01:17:12,500
You left.

768
01:17:13,041 --> 01:17:15,791
Killing people was the only thing
I knew how to do.

769
01:17:16,333 --> 01:17:19,833
Okay, maybe it wasn't the best environment
to raise a child in.

770
01:17:19,916 --> 01:17:21,375
You think?

771
01:17:22,833 --> 01:17:24,416
It made you who you are.

772
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:26,250
At least we can agree on that.

773
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:42,708
And you are a strong, smart,
incredibly impressive young woman.

774
01:17:44,916 --> 01:17:48,291
There's not a single person on earth
I'd rather kill people with.

775
01:17:49,916 --> 01:17:51,083
Thanks, Ma.

776
01:17:52,166 --> 01:17:55,750
You're so strong!
You can't be 8 and three quarters.

777
01:17:55,833 --> 01:17:56,875
I am.

778
01:17:56,958 --> 01:17:59,625
You sure you're not
28 and three quarters?

779
01:18:07,916 --> 01:18:10,416
Anna May, Madeleine. Come and see this.

780
01:18:21,541 --> 01:18:23,083
We're not leaving.

781
01:18:23,583 --> 01:18:26,625
Scarlet's still a librarian,
no matter if she's an asshole.

782
01:18:26,708 --> 01:18:28,458
- Language.
- Right.

783
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,416
- So these...
- Jerks.

784
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:33,416
...jerks up there

785
01:18:34,166 --> 01:18:36,708
just made the biggest mistake
of their lives.

786
01:18:36,791 --> 01:18:40,791
They stepped into our library
and threatened our own flesh and blood.

787
01:18:40,875 --> 01:18:42,708
They're not gonna push us around.

788
01:18:42,791 --> 01:18:46,500
They're not gonna scare us off.
This ends now.

789
01:18:46,583 --> 01:18:49,541
Madeleine, finish getting the van ready.

790
01:18:49,625 --> 01:18:53,666
Florence, you and I are going up there
to thin the herd.

791
01:18:54,291 --> 01:18:58,458
We're gonna bring the sky down
on their mother-fudging heads.

792
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,000
All in favor?

793
01:19:00,083 --> 01:19:02,166
- Aye.
- Aye.

794
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:04,500
Aye.

795
01:19:07,291 --> 01:19:08,666
Motion carried.

796
01:20:13,166 --> 01:20:15,000
You think you have a chance here?

797
01:20:15,083 --> 01:20:17,250
I have an army.

798
01:20:17,333 --> 01:20:19,541
Oh, yeah? Well, I've got my mom.

799
01:20:27,875 --> 01:20:29,291
I wish we had more time, Ma.

800
01:20:30,375 --> 01:20:31,916
It's quality, not quantity.

801
01:20:35,208 --> 01:20:36,333
Chin up.

802
01:20:37,125 --> 01:20:40,291
Why don't you come out,
and I'll put a bullet through your head?

803
01:20:40,958 --> 01:20:41,958
Nice and quick.

804
01:20:42,833 --> 01:20:44,958
Why don't you go fudge yourself?

805
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:51,208
If you make me work for it,
I'll shoot you in the stomach.

806
01:20:51,291 --> 01:20:53,000
Then we'll have some real fun together.

807
01:21:03,250 --> 01:21:04,708
Hey, dum-dums.

808
01:21:14,916 --> 01:21:17,666
Hey, idiots. Catch these.

809
01:22:12,208 --> 01:22:15,541
Idiots to the left.
Morons to the right.

810
01:22:15,625 --> 01:22:18,750
The rest of you knuckleheads stay here
and kill those two.

811
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Put these on.

812
01:23:29,041 --> 01:23:31,208
I'm gonna make a little noise,

813
01:23:31,291 --> 01:23:32,791
so play it loud.

814
01:23:33,416 --> 01:23:35,166
Can you do that for me?

815
01:25:29,875 --> 01:25:31,000
Sam!

816
01:25:31,791 --> 01:25:33,250
Reload!

817
01:30:18,083 --> 01:30:20,083
You've got something in your hair.

818
01:30:24,541 --> 01:30:25,666
It's a tooth.

819
01:30:45,083 --> 01:30:46,416
Hey.

820
01:30:50,833 --> 01:30:52,000
He...

821
01:30:52,083 --> 01:30:53,291
He took Emily.

822
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,791
I couldn't save her.

823
01:30:58,333 --> 01:31:00,250
It's okay.

824
01:31:00,333 --> 01:31:02,000
We'll get her back.

825
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,291
It was nice...

826
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,375
having a kid in the library again.

827
01:32:09,958 --> 01:32:12,791
"There is little joy in life for me."

828
01:32:13,916 --> 01:32:16,875
"And little terror in the grave"

829
01:32:16,958 --> 01:32:20,500
"I've lived the parting hour to see."

830
01:32:20,583 --> 01:32:24,208
"Of one I would have died to save."

831
01:32:48,916 --> 01:32:52,750
Well, that was exciting.
Been a long time since I killed someone.

832
01:32:53,375 --> 01:32:54,833
Let me talk to Emily.

833
01:32:55,750 --> 01:32:57,458
It's a real tragedy

834
01:32:57,541 --> 01:33:00,833
what happens to poor orphans
in our line of work, you know?

835
01:33:01,625 --> 01:33:03,000
It's really quite sad.

836
01:33:05,875 --> 01:33:07,083
What do you want?

837
01:33:07,958 --> 01:33:10,083
My uncle insists on meeting you.

838
01:33:10,166 --> 01:33:12,291
He says, skinning you alive will let him

839
01:33:12,375 --> 01:33:14,875
work through his, uh, grief.

840
01:33:15,958 --> 01:33:17,958
That's not too much to ask, is it?

841
01:33:18,041 --> 01:33:19,458
If I come to you,

842
01:33:20,208 --> 01:33:21,583
Emily goes free.

843
01:33:22,625 --> 01:33:24,458
And everyone else is off the table.

844
01:33:29,083 --> 01:33:30,791
Okay, we have a deal.

845
01:33:31,458 --> 01:33:32,458
The diner.

846
01:33:33,166 --> 01:33:34,416
Can't wait.

847
01:33:36,125 --> 01:33:37,125
We gotta go.

848
01:33:37,875 --> 01:33:40,666
You can't just hand yourself over
to those animals.

849
01:33:40,750 --> 01:33:42,916
They can't bring guns into the diner.

850
01:33:43,708 --> 01:33:46,666
- It's Emily's best chance.
- It's a suicide mission.

851
01:33:46,750 --> 01:33:48,833
Well, someone else got a plan? Hmm?

852
01:33:52,083 --> 01:33:54,250
I, uh... I don't right now, no.

853
01:33:56,583 --> 01:33:58,166
But it's you, Mom.

854
01:34:00,833 --> 01:34:02,500
You always have a plan.

855
01:34:03,458 --> 01:34:04,541
Sorry.

856
01:34:10,250 --> 01:34:12,000
Then I guess this is goodbye.

857
01:34:48,291 --> 01:34:49,916
They're waiting for you, honey.

858
01:34:50,875 --> 01:34:52,166
Thanks, Rose.

859
01:35:12,833 --> 01:35:14,333
Did they hurt you?

860
01:35:19,541 --> 01:35:21,375
It's been a long day.

861
01:35:22,708 --> 01:35:24,291
It's gonna be over soon, okay?

862
01:35:26,416 --> 01:35:27,500
Okay.

863
01:35:38,958 --> 01:35:40,666
You're a special kid, Emily.

864
01:35:42,750 --> 01:35:45,125
I wish I had more time to get to know you.

865
01:36:01,500 --> 01:36:02,750
I'm Jim.

866
01:36:03,916 --> 01:36:05,166
Samantha.

867
01:36:07,958 --> 01:36:09,250
You know, Samantha...

868
01:36:10,458 --> 01:36:13,750
I've always considered myself a feminist.

869
01:36:15,416 --> 01:36:19,125
When my first daughter was born,
I was over the moon.

870
01:36:20,375 --> 01:36:22,291
Painted half the house pink.

871
01:36:23,041 --> 01:36:26,458
It was all unicorns and lollipops.

872
01:36:28,625 --> 01:36:30,708
And my second daughter was born.

873
01:36:32,041 --> 01:36:34,208
And the third and the fourth.

874
01:36:36,333 --> 01:36:37,500
Girls...

875
01:36:39,250 --> 01:36:42,083
always whispering at the dining table.

876
01:36:44,041 --> 01:36:46,500
Always giggling in dark corners.

877
01:36:49,166 --> 01:36:50,791
I love my girls.

878
01:36:52,041 --> 01:36:53,791
But I don't understand them.

879
01:36:57,333 --> 01:36:58,916
Then my son was born.

880
01:37:00,791 --> 01:37:02,083
It was different.

881
01:37:02,833 --> 01:37:03,833
Simple.

882
01:37:06,666 --> 01:37:08,250
We understood each other.

883
01:37:10,083 --> 01:37:11,875
And I wasn't alone any more.

884
01:37:19,541 --> 01:37:20,833
I know...

885
01:37:23,291 --> 01:37:25,625
it was just a job to you, and he was...

886
01:37:26,541 --> 01:37:28,875
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

887
01:37:31,250 --> 01:37:32,625
None of that matters,

888
01:37:33,791 --> 01:37:36,625
because you took him away from me.

889
01:37:40,708 --> 01:37:43,416
I'm going to do terrible things to you,
Samantha.

890
01:37:45,625 --> 01:37:48,833
You're going to suffer more
than you thought even possible.

891
01:37:50,500 --> 01:37:55,291
Because you have made me
a stranger in my own home again.

892
01:37:56,833 --> 01:37:58,208
For what it's worth...

893
01:37:59,583 --> 01:38:03,333
I am very sorry about your son.

894
01:38:04,666 --> 01:38:06,333
Thank you, Samantha.

895
01:38:09,583 --> 01:38:11,291
Just let the girl go.

896
01:38:12,791 --> 01:38:13,791
Not yet.

897
01:38:17,500 --> 01:38:19,250
We had a deal.

898
01:38:19,333 --> 01:38:20,958
And I'm a man of my word.

899
01:38:22,166 --> 01:38:25,083
I will set the girl free, unharmed.

900
01:38:27,750 --> 01:38:30,250
But only after she's watched
what I do to you.

901
01:38:35,291 --> 01:38:36,500
Please.

902
01:38:38,750 --> 01:38:39,875
Please, I...

903
01:38:40,416 --> 01:38:42,458
I will do anything.

904
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:45,500
Don't start begging yet.

905
01:38:46,125 --> 01:38:48,000
There's plenty of time for that.

906
01:38:49,958 --> 01:38:52,791
- Can I get you something?
- No, we're just fine.

907
01:38:52,875 --> 01:38:55,458
Maybe some more coffee,
or apple pie?

908
01:38:55,541 --> 01:38:58,708
If I have to tell you no again,
there will be consequences.

909
01:39:07,958 --> 01:39:09,125
Hi, sweetheart.

910
01:39:11,208 --> 01:39:12,208
Hi, Mom.

911
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,291
Guess there was a plan, after all.

912
01:39:29,375 --> 01:39:30,916
Guess so.

913
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
Why don't you take Emily out of here?

914
01:39:33,083 --> 01:39:34,833
It's no place for a kid.

915
01:39:34,916 --> 01:39:36,416
Stay out of this, ladies.

916
01:39:37,041 --> 01:39:38,125
It's not your fight.

917
01:39:39,166 --> 01:39:41,541
There's no more standing on the sidelines.

918
01:39:41,625 --> 01:39:43,541
We all need to pick a side.

919
01:39:43,625 --> 01:39:45,250
Right, ladies.

920
01:43:26,875 --> 01:43:27,875
Emily.

921
01:44:01,750 --> 01:44:04,625
I am so sorry I killed your father, Emily.

922
01:44:06,333 --> 01:44:08,291
If I could take it back...

923
01:44:08,375 --> 01:44:09,458
I know.

924
01:44:10,458 --> 01:44:12,000
But you tried to save him.

925
01:44:13,833 --> 01:44:14,833
Still.

926
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:17,833
And you saved me.

927
01:44:23,125 --> 01:44:24,291
Thank you.

928
01:44:25,500 --> 01:44:28,708
Besides...
I know you just pulled the trigger.

929
01:44:30,083 --> 01:44:32,750
I know there was someone else
who told you what to do.

930
01:44:34,208 --> 01:44:36,166
Who sent you to my father?

931
01:44:46,666 --> 01:44:49,500
There's a group of men called The Firm.

932
01:44:53,541 --> 01:44:56,416
It's a... It's a girl scout.

933
01:44:56,500 --> 01:44:58,083
Get rid of her.

934
01:44:58,916 --> 01:45:00,375
No, wait.

935
01:45:01,291 --> 01:45:04,583
They've been running things
for a long, long time.

936
01:45:06,500 --> 01:45:08,333
They make all the rules and...

937
01:45:09,916 --> 01:45:11,791
change them when it fits their needs.

938
01:45:17,333 --> 01:45:19,208
They think they're untouchable.

939
01:45:22,083 --> 01:45:24,541
They think they can get away
with anything.

940
01:45:26,416 --> 01:45:29,166
But they won't, right?

941
01:45:31,791 --> 01:45:32,791
No.

942
01:45:33,291 --> 01:45:34,375
They won't.

943
01:45:36,375 --> 01:45:37,625
Not any more.

944
01:45:43,750 --> 01:45:46,625
Well, well, well. What do we have here?

945
01:45:46,708 --> 01:45:48,666
I'm selling cookies.

946
01:45:48,750 --> 01:45:51,666
Oh, really? Uh, where are they?

947
01:45:54,125 --> 01:45:58,250
You're the little girl
that I've heard so much about, aren't you?

948
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:07,833
They think so little of me
they sent a child to do their dirty work?

949
01:46:07,916 --> 01:46:09,416
I'm insulted, frankly.

950
01:46:17,916 --> 01:46:20,416
"Look into your heart"?

951
01:46:28,416 --> 01:46:30,041
Fuck me.

952
01:46:32,791 --> 01:46:33,916
Can you hear me?

953
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:35,833
Loud and clear.

954
01:46:35,916 --> 01:46:37,666
We're both alive and well.

955
01:46:37,750 --> 01:46:39,458
That's the way it's gonna stay.

956
01:46:39,541 --> 01:46:42,500
Come on, Sam.
You know that's not up to me.

957
01:46:42,583 --> 01:46:45,250
You get one chance to end this now.

958
01:46:46,458 --> 01:46:49,666
Years ago, my mom screwed up
and pulled the wrong trigger.

959
01:46:50,250 --> 01:46:52,541
I'm not making the same mistake.

960
01:46:52,625 --> 01:46:56,083
That little girl in front of you
will have a future.

961
01:46:56,958 --> 01:47:00,583
Go back to the partners
and tell them we know where they work,

962
01:47:01,166 --> 01:47:02,291
where they live.

963
01:47:02,375 --> 01:47:06,125
We can kill them 100 times over
without them ever seeing us coming.

964
01:47:07,708 --> 01:47:10,166
Tell them they were only spared

965
01:47:10,666 --> 01:47:12,375
because of an eight-year-old girl.

966
01:47:12,458 --> 01:47:14,375
Eight and three quarters.

967
01:47:15,083 --> 01:47:17,541
Sorry. Eight and three quarters.

968
01:47:18,500 --> 01:47:19,500
Got it?

969
01:47:19,541 --> 01:47:20,875
Got it.

970
01:47:21,375 --> 01:47:24,375
Now, close your eyes
and count to ten.

971
01:47:24,458 --> 01:47:25,708
Slow.

972
01:47:28,625 --> 01:47:29,625
One...

973
01:47:30,416 --> 01:47:31,708
two...

974
01:47:32,291 --> 01:47:33,375
three...

975
01:47:34,416 --> 01:47:35,416
four...

976
01:47:36,125 --> 01:47:37,125
five...

977
01:47:37,708 --> 01:47:38,750
six...

978
01:47:39,291 --> 01:47:40,291
seven...

979
01:47:40,833 --> 01:47:41,833
eight...

980
01:47:42,875 --> 01:47:43,916
nine...

981
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:48,000
ten.

982
01:48:11,625 --> 01:48:13,000
Can I drive?

983
01:48:13,791 --> 01:48:14,791
No.

984
01:48:16,333 --> 01:48:18,291
Can I turn on the radio, then?

985
01:48:20,875 --> 01:48:22,208
Go nuts, baby girl.

986
01:48:25,166 --> 01:48:28,833
Right folks,
time to hit the road.

987
01:48:28,916 --> 01:48:32,166
Take care, and see you on the other side.
