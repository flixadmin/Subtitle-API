1
00:00:01,307 --> 00:00:03,657
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,093 --> 00:00:05,593
After five years in hell,

3
00:00:05,595 --> 00:00:08,029
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:08,411 --> 00:00:10,210
to save my city.

5
00:00:10,212 --> 00:00:12,680
Now others have
joined my crusade.

6
00:00:12,682 --> 00:00:14,915
To them, I am Oliver Queen.

7
00:00:14,917 --> 00:00:17,117
To the rest
of Starling City,

8
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:18,519
I am someone else.

9
00:00:18,521 --> 00:00:21,455
I am something else.

10
00:00:21,457 --> 00:00:23,057
Previously, on "Arrow"...

11
00:00:23,059 --> 00:00:24,591
There's a lot of good people,
they lose someone,

12
00:00:24,593 --> 00:00:25,693
they lose themselves,
which is why they come in here

13
00:00:25,695 --> 00:00:27,294
to work off that rage.

14
00:00:27,296 --> 00:00:30,564
Roy, are you ok?
You look a little tired.

15
00:00:30,566 --> 00:00:32,199
I just haven't been
sleeping much lately.

16
00:00:32,201 --> 00:00:34,535
If I had accepted my life,
I would be a cocktail waitress

17
00:00:34,537 --> 00:00:36,503
in Vegas
like my mother,

18
00:00:36,505 --> 00:00:38,806
and I never would have believed some
crazy guy in a hood

19
00:00:38,808 --> 00:00:41,942
when he told me I could be
more than just some it girl.

20
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,167
You're not moving
very quickly this morning.

21
00:01:07,169 --> 00:01:09,103
I just didn't sleep
much last night.

22
00:01:15,978 --> 00:01:18,212
You're not boxing, girl.

23
00:01:18,214 --> 00:01:19,446
You're not even fighting.

24
00:01:19,448 --> 00:01:21,248
You're just lashing out.

25
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:22,616
Come on!

26
00:01:25,654 --> 00:01:26,887
Impressive.

27
00:01:26,889 --> 00:01:30,324
How do normal people
spend their morning?

28
00:01:31,994 --> 00:01:34,795
Four...

29
00:01:36,365 --> 00:01:38,832
Five.

30
00:01:38,834 --> 00:01:41,502
Yes!

31
00:01:47,877 --> 00:01:49,510
Mrs. Fernandes!

32
00:01:49,512 --> 00:01:53,013
I already told you,
I haven't seen

33
00:01:53,015 --> 00:01:54,481
your...cat.

34
00:01:54,483 --> 00:01:55,649
I haven't
seen him, either.

35
00:01:55,651 --> 00:01:57,584
Or is the cat a girl?

36
00:01:57,586 --> 00:01:59,253
Was I being misogynist
just now?

37
00:01:59,255 --> 00:02:00,888
Or is it misogynistic?
I never know.

38
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:03,490
Ray...What are you--

39
00:02:03,492 --> 00:02:05,125
Nice place you've got here.
Lots of space.

40
00:02:05,127 --> 00:02:06,727
So it occurred
to me this morning,

41
00:02:06,729 --> 00:02:08,462
what's the one thing
that Queen Consolidated has

42
00:02:08,464 --> 00:02:10,164
that we don't use
to its maximum potential?

43
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:11,698
A doorbell?

44
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,067
Have you heard of a process
called cogeneration?

45
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:16,303
I haven't even looked
at a cup of coffee yet.

46
00:02:16,305 --> 00:02:19,406
Well, cogeneration is--
The repurposing

47
00:02:19,408 --> 00:02:22,209
of waste heat given
off by electricity production.

48
00:02:22,211 --> 00:02:23,811
Exactly. It's a principle
of thermodynamic efficiency,

49
00:02:23,813 --> 00:02:26,580
which occurred to me
could be applied to a building

50
00:02:26,582 --> 00:02:29,349
which generates over
240,000 watts of electricity.

51
00:02:29,351 --> 00:02:30,598
Like Queen Consolidated.

52
00:02:30,622 --> 00:02:31,786
Mm-hmm.

53
00:02:31,787 --> 00:02:34,321
I did some
preliminary calculations

54
00:02:34,323 --> 00:02:36,423
on the drive over.

55
00:02:36,425 --> 00:02:39,693
You want to sell QC's excess
energy back to the city?

56
00:02:39,695 --> 00:02:42,229
If by "sell" you mean "give away
for free," then yes.

57
00:02:42,231 --> 00:02:44,498
Energy is something
that should be given

58
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,900
freely to the masses.

59
00:02:46,902 --> 00:02:49,403
Uh, you still haven't found
Mrs. Fernandes' cat, I'm guessing.

60
00:02:58,881 --> 00:03:00,547
Oh, my
beautiful girl!

61
00:03:00,549 --> 00:03:02,249
Very friendly with
your neighbors, I see.

62
00:03:02,251 --> 00:03:03,151
Mom...

63
00:03:03,175 --> 00:03:03,852
Mom?

64
00:03:03,853 --> 00:03:05,385
What are you doing here?

65
00:03:05,387 --> 00:03:07,387
Honey, I came
to see you.

66
00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:09,456
For a visit.
Look, look, look.

67
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:11,325
Didn't you
get my text?

68
00:03:11,327 --> 00:03:13,427
Mom, to send a text,
you actually have

69
00:03:13,429 --> 00:03:15,562
to press "send" on the text.

70
00:03:15,564 --> 00:03:18,365
Oh, ok, not a big
deal, I'll do it right now.

71
00:03:21,904 --> 00:03:22,920
Are you adopted?

72
00:03:22,944 --> 00:03:24,439
Hmm.

73
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,407
Oh! I'm so sorry. I didn't know
you had somebody staying over.

74
00:03:27,409 --> 00:03:29,009
Oh, no, he's not
staying over.

75
00:03:29,011 --> 00:03:30,143
He's not, like,

76
00:03:30,145 --> 00:03:32,646
we're not--
this is my boss.

77
00:03:32,648 --> 00:03:33,814
It's a pleasure
to meet you, Miss Smoak.

78
00:03:33,816 --> 00:03:36,049
Hi. You can call me Donna.

79
00:03:36,051 --> 00:03:36,831
Mom...

80
00:03:36,855 --> 00:03:37,752
I'm Ray.

81
00:03:37,753 --> 00:03:39,953
Oh, my god. Palmer?

82
00:03:39,955 --> 00:03:42,422
You're that watch guy.

83
00:03:42,424 --> 00:03:44,892
We like to call them
smart wearables.

84
00:03:44,894 --> 00:03:47,361
I bought one
of your watches! Look!

85
00:03:47,363 --> 00:03:49,863
See? Felicity here
thinks I don't

86
00:03:49,865 --> 00:03:51,465
pay attention to all
of her tech-y things.

87
00:03:51,467 --> 00:03:54,301
Yeah, I see you've got a 3GS.

88
00:03:54,303 --> 00:03:57,070
I'm actually wearing a prototype
for the new six.

89
00:03:57,072 --> 00:03:59,406
Yeah, it basically
replaces your computer.

90
00:03:59,408 --> 00:04:00,607
Very fancy.
You know what?

91
00:04:00,609 --> 00:04:01,675
It's yours.

92
00:04:01,677 --> 00:04:03,176
Oh, no.

93
00:04:03,178 --> 00:04:04,645
Seriously?

94
00:04:07,516 --> 00:04:09,416
I'll let you two
catch up.

95
00:04:09,418 --> 00:04:11,618
Let me know what you think
about those cogeneration numbers,

96
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,887
and Donna, hope to see
you again soon.

97
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:16,256
Well, don't count on it.
She'll probably be really busy...

98
00:04:16,258 --> 00:04:20,427
Planning my funeral
after I die of embarrassment.

99
00:04:20,429 --> 00:04:24,331
"You are standing
in an open field

100
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,133
"west of the White House

101
00:04:26,135 --> 00:04:30,103
with a boarded front door."

102
00:04:30,105 --> 00:04:31,672
What are you doing?

103
00:04:31,674 --> 00:04:33,974
I just finished coding
a Linux emulator for Zork.

104
00:04:33,976 --> 00:04:36,977
Ohh. "It is
pitch black.

105
00:04:36,979 --> 00:04:40,847
"You are likely
to be eaten...

106
00:04:40,849 --> 00:04:42,950
by a grue."

107
00:04:42,952 --> 00:04:44,651
I guess you'll have
to protect me.

108
00:04:44,653 --> 00:04:47,254
Why can't you just quietly
have sex under a comforter

109
00:04:47,256 --> 00:04:49,356
like most
college students?

110
00:04:52,294 --> 00:04:54,294
You found
an exploitable note?

111
00:04:54,296 --> 00:04:57,531
Now I just need your super
computer virus to crack the firewall.

112
00:04:57,533 --> 00:04:59,333
I really wish you wouldn't
call my x-axis bi-numeric

113
00:04:59,335 --> 00:05:01,468
algorithm a "super-virus."

114
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:06,073
Spoofing the IP,
switching to MD6, and...

115
00:05:06,075 --> 00:05:09,943
Somebody take a screenshot.
We have to post this to hackerforum,

116
00:05:09,945 --> 00:05:11,912
to brag that
we actually got in!

117
00:05:11,914 --> 00:05:15,349
Hold on. 30 seconds until
the firewall goes back up.

118
00:05:15,351 --> 00:05:18,018
Cooper, what are you doing?

119
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,720
I think the world would
be a much better place

120
00:05:19,722 --> 00:05:21,154
if there weren't any
student loans, don't you?

121
00:05:21,156 --> 00:05:22,556
You can't wipe out
all the loans,

122
00:05:22,558 --> 00:05:24,057
they'll never think
it's a glitch.

123
00:05:24,059 --> 00:05:25,359
They're going to track
us down and find us!

124
00:05:25,361 --> 00:05:27,260
- 10 seconds.
- Cooper!

125
00:05:27,262 --> 00:05:28,562
I'm not going to jail
for you, Cooper,

126
00:05:28,564 --> 00:05:31,565
and you shouldn't, either.

127
00:05:31,961 --> 00:05:33,260
Coop!

128
00:05:33,262 --> 00:05:34,481
I almost had it!

129
00:05:34,505 --> 00:05:36,030
What were you thinking?!

130
00:05:36,031 --> 00:05:38,766
Ever heard of
hacktivisim?

131
00:05:38,768 --> 00:05:40,834
Instead of posting
to web forums,

132
00:05:40,836 --> 00:05:42,236
we could be doing
some real good in the world.

133
00:05:42,238 --> 00:05:44,405
And going to prison
in the process.

134
00:05:44,407 --> 00:05:46,273
It's all about what you want
to be when you grow up, babe--

135
00:05:46,275 --> 00:05:48,942
A hacker,
or a hero?

136
00:05:54,183 --> 00:05:56,784
Hello?

137
00:05:56,786 --> 00:05:59,153
Speedy?

138
00:06:00,256 --> 00:06:02,756
Just signed the lease.

139
00:06:02,758 --> 00:06:04,124
What do you think?

140
00:06:04,126 --> 00:06:05,859
Thea, you're signing
a lease on a spot

141
00:06:05,861 --> 00:06:08,662
that you can't
possibly afford.

142
00:06:08,664 --> 00:06:11,331
I can, actually.

143
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:12,933
Whose money?

144
00:06:12,935 --> 00:06:15,269
Malcolm Merlyn's.
His estate, I mean.

145
00:06:15,271 --> 00:06:18,472
When I left Starling City,
I mentioned something

146
00:06:18,474 --> 00:06:20,941
to Ned Foster about Malcolm
being my father,

147
00:06:20,943 --> 00:06:24,945
and there's a lot of legal stuff
I didn't understand, and--

148
00:06:24,947 --> 00:06:26,346
He left you money?

149
00:06:26,348 --> 00:06:27,815
The entire world
thinks he's dead.

150
00:06:27,817 --> 00:06:30,284
So, yes, legally,
his estate goes

151
00:06:30,286 --> 00:06:31,518
to his last living heir.

152
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,587
And, ahem, last week
when you told me

153
00:06:33,589 --> 00:06:35,222
that you had
investors for the club,

154
00:06:35,224 --> 00:06:37,024
that was a lie?

155
00:06:37,026 --> 00:06:38,525
I was afraid
you wouldn't react well

156
00:06:38,527 --> 00:06:40,461
to the idea of me
taking his money.

157
00:06:40,463 --> 00:06:42,095
It's blood money,
Thea!

158
00:06:42,097 --> 00:06:44,264
You don't know
what Malcolm Merlyn is capable of!

159
00:06:44,266 --> 00:06:46,467
I know what his money
is capable of--

160
00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:49,470
renting me
this really sweet loft.

161
00:06:49,472 --> 00:06:51,338
Listen to me.
He's alive,

162
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:54,641
and if you take
his money, he has a hold on you.

163
00:06:54,643 --> 00:06:57,044
I think you're being
a little melodramatic.

164
00:06:57,046 --> 00:07:01,248
I'm his daughter, ok?
He's not going to put me in danger.

165
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,817
He's responsible for the death of
503 innocent people,

166
00:07:03,819 --> 00:07:05,886
including your brother.

167
00:07:05,888 --> 00:07:09,022
Now that is a card
that you do not get to play.

168
00:07:09,024 --> 00:07:10,891
You are my brother,

169
00:07:10,893 --> 00:07:13,527
but that does not mean
you have the right to tell me

170
00:07:13,529 --> 00:07:15,262
what I can do with my life.

171
00:07:15,264 --> 00:07:17,764
I am my own person.

172
00:07:17,766 --> 00:07:20,767
The movers are coming tomorrow,
so you can stop by with popcorn

173
00:07:20,769 --> 00:07:23,370
or not stop by at all.

174
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,127
Oh, please.

175
00:08:05,748 --> 00:08:07,748
What is going on?

176
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,983
Ollie?

177
00:08:28,237 --> 00:08:30,737
You ok?

178
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,313
We are Brother Eye.

179
00:08:39,315 --> 00:08:42,449
Judgment has been rendered
against this city.

180
00:08:42,451 --> 00:08:44,418
Its sentence carried out.

181
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,120
An earthquake. A siege.

182
00:08:47,122 --> 00:08:48,689
This is what comes next--

183
00:08:48,691 --> 00:08:51,191
a new life you will
live on your knees,

184
00:08:51,193 --> 00:08:55,729
and it will take nothing more than
a push of a button.

185
00:08:55,731 --> 00:08:57,864
We are in control now.

186
00:08:57,866 --> 00:09:00,367
And this is just
the beginning.

187
00:09:00,369 --> 00:09:03,570
Let there be light.

Ooh, a nightclub.

191
00:09:25,525 --> 00:09:28,844
You know, I'm really
not dressed for a nightclub.

192
00:09:28,845 --> 00:09:29,873
Really?

193
00:09:29,897 --> 00:09:31,180
You think?

194
00:09:31,181 --> 00:09:32,580
My friend owns the
place. He just needs

195
00:09:32,582 --> 00:09:34,682
a little help turning
the power back on, so...

196
00:09:34,684 --> 00:09:35,883
Oh.

197
00:09:35,885 --> 00:09:38,686
Why don't you...
Come, come.

198
00:09:38,688 --> 00:09:41,222
Stay put.
Stay here?

199
00:09:41,224 --> 00:09:42,957
Right here.
Ok.

200
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,058
Mm-hmm.

201
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,227
Hey. Any luck
tracking this--

202
00:09:46,229 --> 00:09:48,529
Hello.

203
00:09:48,531 --> 00:09:51,232
Hi. Uh,

204
00:09:51,234 --> 00:09:52,900
please tell me
this is your friend.

205
00:09:52,902 --> 00:09:55,470
No. Mom,

206
00:09:55,472 --> 00:09:56,568
this is Oliver...

207
00:09:56,569 --> 00:09:57,269
Queen.

208
00:09:57,273 --> 00:09:59,273
Very nice to meet you.

209
00:09:59,275 --> 00:10:00,675
Yes, it's so nice
to meet you, too.

210
00:10:00,677 --> 00:10:04,078
How many billionaires
do you know?

211
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,782
Diggle, meet Felicity's mom.

212
00:10:09,719 --> 00:10:11,753
Mom. John Diggle.

213
00:10:11,755 --> 00:10:13,221
- Hi.
- Very nice to meet you.

214
00:10:13,223 --> 00:10:15,723
Nice to meet you,
too. Oh! Hello!

215
00:10:15,725 --> 00:10:17,425
Who is this
little nugget?

216
00:10:17,427 --> 00:10:19,093
This is my daughter Sara.

217
00:10:19,095 --> 00:10:20,394
- Ooh!
- Mom.

218
00:10:20,396 --> 00:10:22,296
Mom. Ahem, mom!

219
00:10:22,298 --> 00:10:23,397
What?

220
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:25,666
We have to go
downstairs.

221
00:10:25,668 --> 00:10:26,834
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to stop you.

222
00:10:26,836 --> 00:10:28,569
I'm so sorry.
Little baby moment.

223
00:10:28,571 --> 00:10:29,971
So sorry.

224
00:10:29,973 --> 00:10:31,139
It's great
to meet you, finally.

225
00:10:31,141 --> 00:10:32,974
Yes, yes, definitely.

226
00:10:32,976 --> 00:10:34,408
Why is Sara here?

227
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:35,777
Lyla's on on assignment
in Santa Prisca

228
00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:37,512
and the nanny
called in sick.

229
00:10:37,514 --> 00:10:40,248
But--we can't
bring her down there.

230
00:10:41,951 --> 00:10:44,252
Why not, Oliver,
who's she going to tell?

231
00:10:44,254 --> 00:10:45,653
Well, she--

232
00:10:45,655 --> 00:10:47,855
I'm not comfortable
with her down there.

233
00:10:47,857 --> 00:10:49,290
God help me.

234
00:10:49,292 --> 00:10:52,460
My mother loves
babies. Just...

235
00:10:53,963 --> 00:10:55,863
Really?

236
00:10:55,865 --> 00:10:58,032
Whoever this Brother Eye group is
somehow got access

237
00:10:58,034 --> 00:10:59,500
to the city's
protected network

238
00:10:59,502 --> 00:11:01,135
and uploaded
a system-wide virus.

239
00:11:01,137 --> 00:11:02,770
Any way to trace it?

240
00:11:02,772 --> 00:11:04,672
No, it deleted itself
as soon as it completed its task.

241
00:11:04,674 --> 00:11:06,541
They said the power outage
was just the beginning.

242
00:11:06,543 --> 00:11:09,277
Then let's find
them before there's a next time.

243
00:11:15,244 --> 00:11:17,024
Hey, Laurel,  are you all right?
Did you get here ok?

244
00:11:17,025 --> 00:11:18,625
I'm fine.
I was close.

245
00:11:18,627 --> 00:11:20,327
But why do I get
the emergency services alert?

246
00:11:20,329 --> 00:11:22,195
Why don't they call
the district attorney?

247
00:11:22,197 --> 00:11:23,830
'Cause he's visiting
his niece in Coast City.

248
00:11:23,832 --> 00:11:25,732
You are the acting
district attorney.

249
00:11:25,734 --> 00:11:27,867
Congratulations.

250
00:11:31,606 --> 00:11:32,912
- Hello, Detective--
- Captain.

251
00:11:32,913 --> 00:11:34,146
Look, you're on this
Brother Eye thing, right?

252
00:11:34,148 --> 00:11:35,148
We are.

253
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:36,453
Good,
'cause there's no one

254
00:11:36,453 --> 00:11:38,750
here knows computers
better than you.

255
00:11:39,546 --> 00:11:40,730
No, for the last time,

256
00:11:40,754 --> 00:11:42,655
I am not interested
in buying a fake ID.

257
00:11:42,656 --> 00:11:45,324
I am hanging up now. Bye.

258
00:11:46,927 --> 00:11:49,628
My mom says hi.

259
00:11:51,398 --> 00:11:52,764
You still angry at me?

260
00:11:52,766 --> 00:11:54,366
I was past
the firewall

261
00:11:54,368 --> 00:11:56,234
and into the account network.
I had 3,000 debts wiped

262
00:11:56,236 --> 00:11:57,703
by the time you pulled
the plug on me.

263
00:11:57,705 --> 00:11:59,137
Well, think of how many
accounts you could

264
00:11:59,139 --> 00:12:01,340
go to prison for
if I hadn't stopped you.

265
00:12:01,342 --> 00:12:03,508
Relax.

266
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,843
The DNS wasn't
configured.

267
00:12:04,845 --> 00:12:06,745
They can't
backtrace me.

268
00:12:06,747 --> 00:12:08,981
They can. The subroot
was configured.

269
00:12:08,983 --> 00:12:11,450
By accessing the accounts,
you set off a packets feedback

270
00:12:11,452 --> 00:12:13,552
that anyone could
trace back to.

271
00:12:18,092 --> 00:12:21,326
You are gorgeous when
you're being a chicken.

272
00:12:21,328 --> 00:12:23,762
- Come on, I'm serious.
- I'm serious.

273
00:12:28,502 --> 00:12:29,735
Cooper Seldoel

274
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:31,509
FBI!
Don't move

275
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:33,105
You are under arrest.
What?! No!

276
00:12:33,107 --> 00:12:35,641
No, no, no!

277
00:12:35,643 --> 00:12:37,709
You're under arrest for violation
of U.S. Code title 18,

278
00:12:37,711 --> 00:12:39,411
section 1030.
Don't!

279
00:12:39,413 --> 00:12:41,413
You have the right
to remain silent.

280
00:12:41,415 --> 00:12:45,283
Let go of him,
let him go!

281
00:12:45,285 --> 00:12:48,520
We said this was
just the beginning.

282
00:12:48,522 --> 00:12:52,157
Electricity is not
the only power in the city.

283
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:55,060
Consider money,
for example.

284
00:12:55,062 --> 00:12:57,596
The banks are next to go dark.

285
00:12:57,598 --> 00:13:01,767
Your beloved dollars wiped away
as your accounts will finally all be equal,

286
00:13:01,769 --> 00:13:04,369
at zero.
Felicity...

287
00:13:04,371 --> 00:13:06,238
I'm working on it.
I set up some trace IP packets

288
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,240
before Brother Eye's
last broadcast.

289
00:13:08,242 --> 00:13:10,108
As soon as he opened up the channel,
I scooped  up the bread crumbs.

290
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:12,511
- Bread crumbs we can follow?
- I hope so.

291
00:13:14,815 --> 00:13:16,882
Where's
Captain Lance?

292
00:13:16,884 --> 00:13:19,685
Coordinating squad car
patrols for dispatch.

293
00:13:19,687 --> 00:13:21,186
Why? What's wrong?

294
00:13:21,188 --> 00:13:22,821
There's a situation
at Starling National.

295
00:13:22,823 --> 00:13:24,489
Send in an ESU squad.

296
00:13:24,491 --> 00:13:26,758
Sorry, ma'am,
but you don't have the power to--

297
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,227
I'm acting district attorney.
The city charter gives me

298
00:13:29,229 --> 00:13:30,996
operational authority
in times of crisis,

299
00:13:30,998 --> 00:13:32,597
which this clearly is.

300
00:13:32,599 --> 00:13:34,366
I'm not letting
anyone get hurt.

301
00:13:34,368 --> 00:13:37,069
Send in an ESU now.

302
00:13:41,141 --> 00:13:42,340
What's going on?

303
00:13:42,342 --> 00:13:43,809
SCPD just dispatched
a riot squad

304
00:13:43,811 --> 00:13:45,377
to Starling
National.

305
00:13:45,379 --> 00:13:47,345
It's like fighting a fire
with gasoline.

306
00:13:47,347 --> 00:13:49,381
Suit up.

307
00:13:56,924 --> 00:13:59,391
This group is ordered
to disperse!

308
00:13:59,393 --> 00:14:01,460
Back!

309
00:14:01,462 --> 00:14:03,228
Back behind the line!

310
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:06,397
Oliver, the riot is getting
out of control.

311
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,333
You need to hurry up.

312
00:14:08,335 --> 00:14:11,369
Back! Back
behind the line!

313
00:14:17,344 --> 00:14:19,711
Get away
from the bank!

314
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,460
The teargas is dispersing them,
but we can't calm

315
00:14:35,462 --> 00:14:37,061
the entire city,
Felicity.

316
00:14:37,063 --> 00:14:38,463
The trace led me
to the virus they're using.

317
00:14:38,465 --> 00:14:41,099
It is a mile past complex.

318
00:14:41,101 --> 00:14:43,968
I'm combing through now.

319
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:45,937
No, no, no, no, no, no!

320
00:14:45,939 --> 00:14:47,505
What's wrong?

321
00:14:47,507 --> 00:14:50,174
The virus...
I can't stop it!

322
00:14:50,176 --> 00:14:52,310
- How do you know?
- Because it's mine.

323
00:14:53,713 --> 00:14:56,714
I wrote it five years ago.

324
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:07,831
Ok, ok, before
you say anything,

325
00:15:07,832 --> 00:15:10,534
just know that I never imagined
the virus being used

326
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:12,434
for something like this.
I mean, sure,

327
00:15:12,437 --> 00:15:13,970
I could have
imagined it.

328
00:15:13,971 --> 00:15:15,371
I actually have
a very vivid imagination.

329
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:17,039
Like cronuts!
I had a vision of them before--

330
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,208
Hey.

331
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,243
Relax.

332
00:15:21,245 --> 00:15:23,245
Take a deep breath.

333
00:15:24,648 --> 00:15:26,148
Good.

334
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,816
Now start at the beginning.

335
00:15:27,818 --> 00:15:29,385
I was in this,

336
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:31,020
I guess you could
call it a group,

337
00:15:31,022 --> 00:15:34,023
in college.
We were "hacktivists."

338
00:15:34,025 --> 00:15:36,625
For lack
of a better word.

339
00:15:36,627 --> 00:15:38,594
Civil disobedience

340
00:15:38,596 --> 00:15:41,897
via the World Wide Web.

341
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:44,666
I created this.

342
00:15:44,668 --> 00:15:46,902
This...

343
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:49,705
Super virus.

344
00:15:49,707 --> 00:15:51,774
That could give us
root access

345
00:15:51,776 --> 00:15:54,043
to any infected server.

346
00:15:54,045 --> 00:15:56,145
We could expose
government fraud

347
00:15:56,147 --> 00:15:57,413
and start
virtual sit-ins

348
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:59,882
and digitally
deface criminals.

349
00:15:59,884 --> 00:16:03,352
I guess you could say it was
my first attempt at being a hero.

350
00:16:03,354 --> 00:16:06,688
Felicity.

351
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:08,791
Why didn't you tell me
about any of this?

352
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:12,528
Do we even know
a fraction

353
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:14,663
of what happened to you the five years
that you were away?

354
00:16:14,665 --> 00:16:17,132
Who else had access
to the program?

355
00:16:17,134 --> 00:16:19,668
Myron Forest.
He was my...

356
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,737
I had a boyfriend
in college,

357
00:16:21,739 --> 00:16:23,572
and Myron
was his roommate.

358
00:16:23,574 --> 00:16:25,607
And he was a member
of this hacktivist group?

359
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:27,209
What about the boyfriend?

360
00:16:27,211 --> 00:16:29,545
Oh, he couldn't
have done this.

361
00:16:29,547 --> 00:16:31,780
He's...not
in the picture,

362
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,882
but Myron always had
somewhat of an edge.

363
00:16:33,884 --> 00:16:36,218
Can you get me an address?

364
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,620
Sure.

365
00:16:42,393 --> 00:16:44,493
Just one small problem--

366
00:16:44,495 --> 00:16:46,361
not small,
necessarily, but short.

367
00:16:46,363 --> 00:16:48,730
Just take
the alleyway entrance.

368
00:16:48,732 --> 00:16:51,333
Ok.

369
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,752
Are you ok?

370
00:17:12,423 --> 00:17:13,856
I've been better.

371
00:17:13,858 --> 00:17:16,158
I talked it over with Myron,

372
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,094
and I'm going to tell them
I wrote the super virus.

373
00:17:19,096 --> 00:17:21,063
You can't do that.

374
00:17:21,065 --> 00:17:23,765
I can't let you
rot in prison, Coop.

375
00:17:23,767 --> 00:17:26,034
You can't tell them
you wrote that virus...

376
00:17:26,036 --> 00:17:28,270
'Cause I already
told them I did.

377
00:17:28,272 --> 00:17:29,905
Cooper...

378
00:17:29,907 --> 00:17:32,641
I always said I'd protect you
from the grues.

379
00:17:32,643 --> 00:17:35,577
- This isn't--
- It's better this way.

380
00:17:35,579 --> 00:17:37,846
I wiped out
those loans.

381
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:40,382
There's no reason
both of us should be in prison.

382
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,119
I love you.

383
00:17:44,121 --> 00:17:45,687
Love you, too.

384
00:17:56,634 --> 00:17:59,902
Hey. Got a minute?

385
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,874
Congratulations,
you called in a riot squad,

386
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:08,977
you nearly started one!
And! You did it behind my back.

387
00:18:08,979 --> 00:18:10,679
You were busy,

388
00:18:10,681 --> 00:18:12,814
and the situation
at Starling National was escalating.

389
00:18:12,816 --> 00:18:14,416
You escalated it, Laurel!

390
00:18:14,418 --> 00:18:16,818
Please tell me you can
at least see that now.

391
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,620
Ok.

392
00:18:18,622 --> 00:18:20,889
I'm sorry.

393
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:23,158
Laurel, baby...

394
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,861
What's gotten into you?

395
00:18:25,863 --> 00:18:28,730
You're angry, you're distant,
you're reckless.

396
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:30,299
Tell me you're not
boozing again.

397
00:18:30,301 --> 00:18:32,301
No.

398
00:18:32,303 --> 00:18:34,660
Then what the hell's going on?
Because this isn't you.

399
00:18:34,661 --> 00:18:36,478
Look, I haven't said anything
because I was hoping

400
00:18:36,502 --> 00:18:38,007
 that you would say something,

401
00:18:38,008 --> 00:18:40,342
because you, sweetheart,
you are in ten different kinds of pain,

402
00:18:40,344 --> 00:18:43,178
and you won't talk about it.

403
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:46,081
I can't talk
about it with you.

404
00:18:50,521 --> 00:18:53,021
Ok.

405
00:18:53,023 --> 00:18:55,290
But listen, you don't have
to talk about it with me.

406
00:18:55,292 --> 00:18:56,858
But talk about it
with somebody.

407
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,293
'Cause secrets hurt, baby.

408
00:18:58,295 --> 00:19:00,462
Sometimes more than the truth.

409
00:19:09,873 --> 00:19:11,440
Ahh.

410
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:14,843
Back-up generator
keeps that locked.

411
00:19:14,845 --> 00:19:17,279
Or...so they told me.

412
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:20,515
I could never get that
stupid door to open.

413
00:19:20,517 --> 00:19:23,285
Contractor says the entire
sub level is flooded, though.

414
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,853
It was a water main break.

415
00:19:24,855 --> 00:19:27,122
What are you
doing here, Ollie?

416
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:30,004
A super hacker is trying to take over
the city and I'm worried about you.

417
00:19:32,329 --> 00:19:35,063
I still get to be worried,
right?

418
00:19:35,065 --> 00:19:36,665
Yes.

419
00:19:36,667 --> 00:19:38,767
And if you
really have to,

420
00:19:38,769 --> 00:19:40,869
you can even be
judgmental--

421
00:19:40,871 --> 00:19:43,205
occasionally.

422
00:19:43,207 --> 00:19:45,040
Someone told me
recently

423
00:19:45,042 --> 00:19:47,943
that a family is
pretty precious.

424
00:19:47,945 --> 00:19:51,046
And love,
in spite of everything,

425
00:19:51,048 --> 00:19:52,614
is what makes it
precious.

426
00:19:52,616 --> 00:19:56,351
Right now, the Queen family
is just you and me.

427
00:19:56,353 --> 00:19:59,321
So let it just be you and me.

428
00:20:01,558 --> 00:20:03,091
And don't take Merlyn's money.

429
00:20:03,093 --> 00:20:05,627
I'm trying to meet you
halfway here, Ollie.

430
00:20:05,629 --> 00:20:07,329
The other half
is up to you.

431
00:20:31,422 --> 00:20:33,955
Myron Forest.

432
00:20:33,957 --> 00:20:36,692
You have failed this city.

433
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:41,863
Tell him he has to retract
all the infected packets

434
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:43,732
from subsystem mainframes
within the city.

435
00:20:43,734 --> 00:20:45,801
Tell me how
to shut down the virus.

436
00:20:45,803 --> 00:20:47,135
Do it now.

437
00:20:47,137 --> 00:20:49,171
You think I'm behind
the cyber attacks?

438
00:20:49,173 --> 00:20:50,806
Sounds like
a Brother Eye to me.

439
00:20:50,808 --> 00:20:52,207
I swear to god, I'm not.

440
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:54,176
I head up the IT department
of an accounting firm.

441
00:20:54,178 --> 00:20:56,144
I drive a hybrid. It's blue.

442
00:20:56,146 --> 00:20:57,946
I'm one of the sheep lunatics
like these guys hate.

443
00:20:57,948 --> 00:20:59,581
Why would I do this?

444
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:01,817
Digital fingerprints
are all over this code.

445
00:21:01,819 --> 00:21:04,119
There's an x-axis
bionumeric algorithm.

446
00:21:04,121 --> 00:21:07,456
The code's an x-axis bionumeric algorithm
that you've used before!

447
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,758
In college.

448
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,760
My roommate
and his girlfriend.

449
00:21:11,762 --> 00:21:14,496
Yeah, yeah, sure,
we developed it.

450
00:21:14,498 --> 00:21:16,965
We called it a super virus, but
that doesn't mean I'm the eye guy!

451
00:21:16,967 --> 00:21:18,433
Have you tried
Felicity Smoak?

452
00:21:18,435 --> 00:21:20,168
She's innocent.

453
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:21,570
Then it's got to be
someone else.

454
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:23,739
After we graduated,
I might have showed

455
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:25,774
the code off
to a few people.

456
00:21:25,776 --> 00:21:27,509
- Who were they?!
- I don't remember.

457
00:21:27,511 --> 00:21:30,212
It was five years ago.
I didn't think it was a big deal.

458
00:21:30,214 --> 00:21:32,447
We were just kids
playing with matches.

459
00:21:34,985 --> 00:21:37,486
I am running out
of expletives!

460
00:21:37,488 --> 00:21:38,720
We need
to track down

461
00:21:38,722 --> 00:21:40,422
whoever Myron shared
your code with.

462
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,491
I hacked all of his emails
and all his text messages

463
00:21:42,493 --> 00:21:44,226
from five years ago
and all I got was depressed.

464
00:21:44,228 --> 00:21:46,661
Ok. What
about your ex?

465
00:21:46,663 --> 00:21:48,530
I already told you,
he didn't do it.

466
00:21:48,532 --> 00:21:50,932
Why? Because he's
your ex-boyfriend?

467
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:52,534
Because...

468
00:21:52,536 --> 00:21:55,804
My senior year of college,

469
00:21:55,806 --> 00:21:58,140
Cooper and I did
a stupid thing.

470
00:21:58,142 --> 00:22:01,810
He got arrested
and he went to prison.

471
00:22:01,812 --> 00:22:04,746
So he went to prison.
Maybe he got out.

472
00:22:04,748 --> 00:22:06,014
He didn't.

473
00:22:06,016 --> 00:22:09,084
How do you know?
Because he's dead.

474
00:22:11,255 --> 00:22:13,889
He hung himself
before sentencing.

475
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,192
Felicity, I...

476
00:22:18,362 --> 00:22:21,763
I just really need to be
alone right now.

477
00:22:30,674 --> 00:22:34,042
Ah. I'm glad
you're here.

478
00:22:34,044 --> 00:22:35,310
When I launched
my plan to rebrand

479
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:36,945
Starling
into Star City,

480
00:22:36,947 --> 00:22:40,615
I didn't count on
cyber terrorism.

481
00:22:40,617 --> 00:22:42,717
I'm looking
for a partner

482
00:22:42,719 --> 00:22:44,319
with whom
to drown my sorrows

483
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:45,887
and you definitely

484
00:22:45,889 --> 00:22:48,657
look like someone
who could use a drink.

485
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:51,693
I'm sorry.

486
00:22:52,596 --> 00:22:54,529
My mother...

487
00:22:54,531 --> 00:22:57,332
I didn't have
anywhere else to go.

488
00:22:58,535 --> 00:23:01,503
You ok?

489
00:23:03,474 --> 00:23:05,140
You're an inventor.

490
00:23:05,142 --> 00:23:07,375
Did you ever create

491
00:23:07,377 --> 00:23:10,212
anything that you didn't
think was important,

492
00:23:10,214 --> 00:23:12,013
turns out,

493
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:14,549
it's very important?

494
00:23:14,551 --> 00:23:16,518
Of course.

495
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,387
Those turn out to be
the best inventions.

496
00:23:19,389 --> 00:23:20,989
Not always.

497
00:23:20,991 --> 00:23:22,858
You want to talk about it?

498
00:23:26,163 --> 00:23:28,230
Of course
I'd find you here.

499
00:23:28,232 --> 00:23:31,533
Could you just wait one second?
Wait?

500
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:33,802
I'm sorry;

501
00:23:33,804 --> 00:23:35,770
I've already waited two hours for you
at your apartment,

502
00:23:35,772 --> 00:23:37,839
and before that,
it was two hours in the club.

503
00:23:40,077 --> 00:23:43,378
Is there any way that you could be
anywhere else but here?

504
00:23:49,086 --> 00:23:51,686
Thanks, Mom.

505
00:23:51,688 --> 00:23:54,422
That wasn't
the least bit mortifying.

506
00:23:54,424 --> 00:23:57,292
Only half as bad as parents'
week in freshman year.

507
00:23:57,294 --> 00:23:59,160
Oh, I'm sorry.

508
00:23:59,162 --> 00:24:03,331
I'm sorry I've been reduced to stalking
my own daughter.

509
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:06,101
Because you can't
seem to comprehend

510
00:24:06,103 --> 00:24:07,903
that I can't make
the whole world stop

511
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:11,006
because you decided to
show up on my doorstep.

512
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:13,008
I have responsibilities!

513
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:14,843
Yes, I know, Felicity.

514
00:24:14,845 --> 00:24:16,745
You have work.
You have work, work, work, work.

515
00:24:16,747 --> 00:24:18,580
No, no, no,
you don't understand.

516
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:21,316
It is so much more
than work.

517
00:24:21,318 --> 00:24:23,251
But all you care about
it my love life

518
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:25,287
or how much cleavage
I don't show.

519
00:24:25,289 --> 00:24:26,421
That is not true!

520
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,456
That is completely true!

521
00:24:28,458 --> 00:24:30,725
And I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that I'm terminally single.

522
00:24:30,727 --> 00:24:32,494
I'm sorry I have
an actual job.

523
00:24:32,496 --> 00:24:34,229
I'm sorry that I don't
dress like a porn star!

524
00:24:34,231 --> 00:24:35,697
Which I realize is
a compliment to you.

525
00:24:35,699 --> 00:24:37,766
So I'm so sorry
that I am such

526
00:24:37,768 --> 00:24:39,601
a disappointment to you!

527
00:24:43,473 --> 00:24:45,974
I'm not as smart
as you, Felicity,

528
00:24:45,976 --> 00:24:47,208
or your father.

529
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:49,377
I know that.

530
00:24:49,379 --> 00:24:53,214
Even when you were only six years old,
I could barely keep up with you two.

531
00:24:53,216 --> 00:24:55,317
And...

532
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:57,919
Maybe I wasn't always
the mother you wanted,

533
00:24:57,921 --> 00:24:59,654
but I was always there.

534
00:24:59,656 --> 00:25:01,923
I stayed and I tried.

535
00:25:01,925 --> 00:25:04,492
He...

536
00:25:04,494 --> 00:25:07,495
He left me.

537
00:25:07,497 --> 00:25:10,999
He left us.

538
00:25:11,001 --> 00:25:14,536
But when I look at you,

539
00:25:14,538 --> 00:25:17,405
all I see
is what he gave you.

540
00:25:17,407 --> 00:25:19,608
There is nothing of me...

541
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:22,711
In you.

542
00:25:22,713 --> 00:25:25,080
You know,
it's so funny. I was--

543
00:25:25,082 --> 00:25:27,949
I was always so afraid
that one day,

544
00:25:27,951 --> 00:25:31,386
you were going to leave me,
too.

545
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:36,925
But now I finally realize...

546
00:25:36,927 --> 00:25:39,961
You already did.

547
00:25:57,074 --> 00:25:59,742
There are people on the other end
of this thing, right?

548
00:25:59,744 --> 00:26:01,043
People we can hit?

549
00:26:01,045 --> 00:26:02,444
We need Felicity.

550
00:26:02,446 --> 00:26:04,480
I'm here.

551
00:26:04,482 --> 00:26:08,284
The super virus
has 3,407 traceable access notes.

552
00:26:08,286 --> 00:26:11,253
Hopefully I didn't
put a firewall in every one, though.

553
00:26:11,255 --> 00:26:13,856
Of course I did, because
I'm smarter than that.

554
00:26:13,858 --> 00:26:15,791
Seriously, if I had
two less IQ points,

555
00:26:15,793 --> 00:26:17,459
we never would have
gotten in this mess.

556
00:26:17,461 --> 00:26:19,028
Are you all right?

557
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:20,930
- Where's your mom?
- I don't know.

558
00:26:20,932 --> 00:26:23,332
Probably back
at my place,

559
00:26:23,334 --> 00:26:26,035
wishing she had a different daughter.
It's a long story.

560
00:26:26,037 --> 00:26:28,070
So go see her.
Take an hour.

561
00:26:28,072 --> 00:26:29,471
The city
is under attack.

562
00:26:29,473 --> 00:26:31,740
You're our best chance
of stopping it,

563
00:26:31,742 --> 00:26:33,142
but not like this, Felicity.
Your head's not in the game.

564
00:26:33,144 --> 00:26:34,577
I will get it
together.

565
00:26:34,579 --> 00:26:36,946
Your tracer hack's running.
Take an hour.

566
00:26:36,948 --> 00:26:39,248
Go talk to your mom.

567
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:41,717
I do not have anything
to say to her.

568
00:26:41,719 --> 00:26:43,986
You know, earlier today,
Thea told me

569
00:26:43,988 --> 00:26:46,689
that she literally
has to put up with me

570
00:26:46,691 --> 00:26:48,857
because family is precious.
And that it's love,

571
00:26:48,859 --> 00:26:51,460
in spite of everything,

572
00:26:51,462 --> 00:26:54,029
that makes it precious.

573
00:26:55,166 --> 00:26:57,933
Go.

574
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:09,211
Where's Sara?

575
00:27:09,213 --> 00:27:11,213
The nanny came
to pick her up.

576
00:27:11,215 --> 00:27:13,449
Said he was from a company
called A.R.G.U.S.

577
00:27:13,451 --> 00:27:14,817
I don't know,
I've never heard of it.

578
00:27:14,819 --> 00:27:17,620
I think
that's the point.

579
00:27:17,622 --> 00:27:19,388
Well, I'm glad
you're still here.

580
00:27:20,858 --> 00:27:24,159
You are a terrible liar,
Felicity.

581
00:27:26,364 --> 00:27:29,264
Might be the only thing
we have in common.

582
00:27:29,266 --> 00:27:31,000
I have blonde hair.

583
00:27:31,002 --> 00:27:33,569
You dye it.

584
00:27:33,571 --> 00:27:35,337
You're right.

585
00:27:35,339 --> 00:27:37,206
We're different,

586
00:27:37,208 --> 00:27:39,541
and it's always going to be that way.
And it's not easy--

587
00:27:39,543 --> 00:27:41,577
No, you know
what, it's--

588
00:27:41,579 --> 00:27:45,047
it's totally my fault
for just showing up here uninvited.

589
00:27:45,049 --> 00:27:47,016
Seriously. I think
I just got so excited

590
00:27:47,018 --> 00:27:49,084
about this free flight.

591
00:27:49,086 --> 00:27:50,410
What?

592
00:27:50,411 --> 00:27:52,175
My plane ticket.

593
00:27:52,199 --> 00:27:54,998
I got an email that said
I'd won some contest.

594
00:27:55,526 --> 00:27:59,228
Free first class
round trip to Starling.

595
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:01,330
Email?

596
00:28:03,601 --> 00:28:06,368
Mom.

597
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:08,003
Someone wanted you
to be here.

598
00:28:13,644 --> 00:28:15,044
Mom!

599
00:28:20,685 --> 00:28:23,419
- Baby!
- Mom!

600
00:28:23,421 --> 00:28:24,586
Are you ok?

601
00:28:24,588 --> 00:28:25,654
I'm ok.
Oh!

602
00:28:25,656 --> 00:28:26,955
Oh, thank god!

603
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,460
Where are we?

604
00:28:33,264 --> 00:28:36,732
Felicity Smoak, just the woman
I wanted to see.

605
00:28:36,734 --> 00:28:38,734
What the hell
do you want from me?!

606
00:28:38,736 --> 00:28:39,868
Who are you?

607
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:41,570
You really don't know?

608
00:28:45,776 --> 00:28:48,944
I thought you'd never
forget your first love.

609
00:28:57,378 --> 00:29:00,279
You died.

610
00:29:01,097 --> 00:29:02,196
They told me--

611
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:03,864
That I committed
suicide, right?

612
00:29:03,866 --> 00:29:06,634
The NSA needed a hacker with game
for cyber espionage,

613
00:29:06,636 --> 00:29:08,369
and I needed
to not be in prison

614
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:10,204
for the rest of my life.

615
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:11,639
Because of what the NSA
wanted me doing,

616
00:29:11,641 --> 00:29:15,743
it was...advantageous
for me to be dead.

617
00:29:15,745 --> 00:29:17,678
When I found out you died,

618
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,181
I was devastated.

619
00:29:20,183 --> 00:29:22,083
I loved you.

620
00:29:22,085 --> 00:29:24,252
I loved you, too.

621
00:29:24,254 --> 00:29:26,254
After I finished my time
with the NSA,

622
00:29:26,256 --> 00:29:28,189
I was going to find you.

623
00:29:28,191 --> 00:29:30,291
To let you in on this.

624
00:29:30,293 --> 00:29:31,859
And then I discovered
you'd become this

625
00:29:31,861 --> 00:29:34,328
corporate lap dog.

626
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:37,498
Broke my heart.
You changed.

627
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,367
If you ever thought I was capable
of doing something like this,

628
00:29:39,369 --> 00:29:41,068
you never really
knew me at all.

629
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,670
When you wrote this
virus, Felicity,

630
00:29:42,672 --> 00:29:45,339
you knew exactly
what it was capable of.

631
00:29:45,341 --> 00:29:47,275
All I'm doing is unleashing
the true potential

632
00:29:47,277 --> 00:29:48,409
of what you made.

633
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:49,644
Why?!

634
00:29:49,646 --> 00:29:51,545
This isn't who you are!

635
00:29:51,547 --> 00:29:53,447
Five years with the NSA,

636
00:29:53,449 --> 00:29:55,316
you learn a lot about
how the world works.

637
00:29:55,318 --> 00:29:58,019
How we can't be saved
or salvaged.

638
00:29:58,021 --> 00:29:59,954
How it's every man
for himself.

639
00:29:59,956 --> 00:30:02,723
You also learn that when
a city bank goes under,

640
00:30:02,725 --> 00:30:04,892
say, financial
cyber attack,

641
00:30:04,894 --> 00:30:08,629
the mayor will reach out
to the Treasury Department

642
00:30:08,631 --> 00:30:11,098
and request an influx
of fresh cash.

643
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,934
Cash which is transported
by armored trucks

644
00:30:13,936 --> 00:30:16,637
navigating according to
a closed-end GPS system,

645
00:30:16,639 --> 00:30:19,807
which directs them
to City Deposit.

646
00:30:19,809 --> 00:30:21,642
If the drivers
deviate from the route,

647
00:30:21,644 --> 00:30:25,313
the trucks are shut down.

648
00:30:25,315 --> 00:30:27,581
But you're going to hack
into the system

649
00:30:27,583 --> 00:30:31,118
and direct the cash
to come here.

650
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,753
It was about money,
and I'm the sell-out?

651
00:30:32,755 --> 00:30:33,921
No.

652
00:30:33,923 --> 00:30:36,357
No, babe.

653
00:30:36,359 --> 00:30:37,958
You're the one who's
going to help me.

654
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,894
See, breaking into
the treasury's

655
00:30:39,896 --> 00:30:41,329
asymmetric
encryption

656
00:30:41,331 --> 00:30:43,197
is beyond even
my capabilities.

657
00:30:43,199 --> 00:30:45,366
I'm going to politely decline.

658
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:49,437
- Don't!
- That's why I flew

659
00:30:49,439 --> 00:30:51,872
some motivation
into town for you.

660
00:30:54,344 --> 00:30:56,911
She's been MIA
for over an hour.

661
00:30:56,913 --> 00:30:59,046
Well, you did tell her to go home.
I just had an A.R.G.U.S. agent

662
00:30:59,048 --> 00:31:00,348
pick up Sara there.

663
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,816
I could have them go back,
check things out.

664
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:02,883
Yep.

665
00:31:02,885 --> 00:31:04,885
Ok.

666
00:31:09,258 --> 00:31:11,525
Felicity's
never more

667
00:31:11,527 --> 00:31:13,527
than five feet
from her phone.

668
00:31:13,529 --> 00:31:15,363
Something's wrong.

669
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:21,202
No! No!

670
00:31:25,208 --> 00:31:28,008
That terminal's configured
to only connect

671
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:29,677
with the Treasury's IP.

672
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:30,978
I mention this
so you don't try

673
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,847
to do anything stupid,
like alert the police.

674
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:34,749
I'm so sorry.

675
00:31:34,751 --> 00:31:36,717
Mom...right now's
not really

676
00:31:36,719 --> 00:31:37,885
the best time, ok?

677
00:31:37,887 --> 00:31:39,520
But it might be
the last time, hon,

678
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:40,988
and I want you to know

679
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:43,858
that all I've ever wanted...

680
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:47,728
is for you to be happy.

681
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:50,698
Let's say we hit pause
on the Dr. Phil episode.

682
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,033
It's done!
It's done.

683
00:31:54,504 --> 00:31:55,870
That quick?

684
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:57,872
There's a reason
you wanted me, right?

685
00:31:57,874 --> 00:32:00,107
They'll be at your front
door in five minutes.

686
00:32:00,109 --> 00:32:02,343
Guards will be armed.

687
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:13,387
Stay put, ok?

688
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:14,889
Just because
we used to screw

689
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:17,057
doesn't mean
I won't use this gun.

690
00:32:24,934 --> 00:32:27,201
What's that?

691
00:32:27,203 --> 00:32:30,671
Huh? Oh, that,
that's the watch.

692
00:32:30,673 --> 00:32:32,573
It's the watch
Mr. Palmer gave me.

693
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:35,743
It chimes on the hour, and I guess
when we're about to be killed.

694
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:37,111
We're not going
to be killed.

695
00:32:37,113 --> 00:32:38,245
We're going to get
out of here.

696
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:40,080
It basically replaces
your computer.

697
00:32:40,082 --> 00:32:41,849
You know I don't know
what that means.

698
00:32:41,851 --> 00:32:44,652
It means it has Wifi.

699
00:32:44,654 --> 00:32:46,086
Really?

700
00:32:53,663 --> 00:32:55,863
Ok.

701
00:32:55,865 --> 00:32:57,965
When they're in range...

702
00:32:57,967 --> 00:32:59,633
You know what to do.

703
00:33:13,182 --> 00:33:15,316
I did what you wanted.

704
00:33:15,318 --> 00:33:16,984
You don't have
to kill us.

705
00:33:16,986 --> 00:33:18,619
Really?

706
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,857
Who would have thought

707
00:33:22,859 --> 00:33:25,159
that I'd become the grue?
Hey!

708
00:33:25,161 --> 00:33:26,760
Hey.

709
00:33:26,762 --> 00:33:28,295
You want to wave
that gun at me, fine,

710
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:31,031
but don't you dare
threaten my daughter.

711
00:33:34,837 --> 00:33:37,037
Here I thought you were
all nails and hair.

712
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:39,573
Try single mom who's worked
60 hour weeks in six inch heels for tips

713
00:33:39,575 --> 00:33:42,176
in order to raise that
genius child you see right there.

714
00:33:44,013 --> 00:33:47,014
I may not understand
all this cyber whatever,

715
00:33:47,016 --> 00:33:48,916
but I know without that gun,

716
00:33:48,918 --> 00:33:51,819
you wouldn't last 10 seconds
against my girl.

717
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:53,654
Too bad she doesn't have
10 seconds.

718
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:55,823
I disagree!

719
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:58,692
Put the gun down.

720
00:33:58,694 --> 00:34:00,895
You were always good,
Felicity.

721
00:34:00,897 --> 00:34:02,329
So good.

722
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:04,698
But so am I.

723
00:34:10,706 --> 00:34:12,206
Motion sensored.

724
00:34:12,208 --> 00:34:14,074
They can hit
most any target.

725
00:34:28,124 --> 00:34:29,790
Something's wrong.

726
00:35:03,292 --> 00:35:05,259
Clear.

727
00:35:24,146 --> 00:35:26,847
This is all your fault.

728
00:35:32,121 --> 00:35:35,923
Mom! Mom, are you ok?
Are you ok?

729
00:35:58,397 --> 00:35:59,507
Before,

730
00:35:59,508 --> 00:36:01,008
you were right to keep
pressing on Cooper.

731
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:03,343
Turns out he's not
as dead as I thought.

732
00:36:03,345 --> 00:36:05,245
I've had some
experience with that.

733
00:36:06,094 --> 00:36:08,795
And you learn
not to judge.

734
00:36:08,797 --> 00:36:11,264
Yes.

735
00:36:11,266 --> 00:36:13,900
Are you ok?

736
00:36:14,903 --> 00:36:16,736
I guess so.

737
00:36:16,738 --> 00:36:19,539
Old lovers have a way
of opening old wounds.

738
00:36:21,243 --> 00:36:23,643
Lovers...sounds creepy

739
00:36:23,645 --> 00:36:25,345
no matter how you say it.

740
00:36:26,948 --> 00:36:29,282
Felicity...

741
00:36:29,284 --> 00:36:32,352
I want you to know that whatever
experiences you had to go through,

742
00:36:32,354 --> 00:36:33,920
I'm glad that you did.

743
00:36:33,922 --> 00:36:36,389
They shaped the person
you are today.

744
00:36:36,391 --> 00:36:39,092
And you know how
I feel about her.

745
00:36:39,094 --> 00:36:41,427
I should head out.

746
00:36:43,031 --> 00:36:46,432
You were right.

747
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:50,537
We have to love
our families.

748
00:36:50,539 --> 00:36:52,639
No matter what.

749
00:36:59,781 --> 00:37:02,682
Felicity.

750
00:37:02,684 --> 00:37:04,784
You here?

751
00:37:16,531 --> 00:37:18,865
What happened to you?

752
00:37:18,867 --> 00:37:21,367
This is me now.

753
00:37:30,245 --> 00:37:33,179
You were right.

754
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:37,884
Something is
going on with me.

755
00:37:37,886 --> 00:37:41,287
And my father, he--
he noticed it as well.

756
00:37:41,289 --> 00:37:43,389
He told me I should
open up to someone.

757
00:37:43,391 --> 00:37:46,492
My sister, she--

758
00:37:46,494 --> 00:37:48,494
she died.

759
00:37:48,496 --> 00:37:50,864
Well, she--

760
00:37:50,866 --> 00:37:52,632
she was murdered.

761
00:37:52,634 --> 00:37:54,067
Did they ever catch the--
No.

762
00:37:54,069 --> 00:37:56,836
No one knows that she's gone
except for me.

763
00:37:56,838 --> 00:37:59,505
And I can't tell
anyone. So, yes.

764
00:37:59,507 --> 00:38:01,608
Yes, I am angry.

765
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:02,863
I'm going to help
you with that.

766
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:05,431
See, before, Laurel, you were
swinging at your sister's killer.

767
00:38:05,433 --> 00:38:07,033
That's a target
you're never going to hit.

768
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:08,701
Don't train for that.

769
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:10,369
All right,
train for yourself.

770
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:13,739
See, now I know
how to teach you.

771
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:19,445
So what's it
going to be?

772
00:38:19,447 --> 00:38:21,047
Red or black?

773
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:22,615
Black.

774
00:38:22,617 --> 00:38:24,750
Definitely black.

775
00:38:35,697 --> 00:38:38,097
It was popcorn,
right?

776
00:38:39,334 --> 00:38:40,700
You said you were
meeting me halfway.

777
00:38:40,702 --> 00:38:42,702
This is me
doing my part.

778
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:54,780
I missed you, Speedy.

779
00:38:57,785 --> 00:39:00,987
Let's not miss
each other anymore.

780
00:39:00,989 --> 00:39:04,423
I mean, it was so much easier
to be in each other's lives

781
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:06,359
when we were
underneath the same roof.

782
00:39:06,361 --> 00:39:09,862
So...Why don't you
move in with me?

783
00:39:09,864 --> 00:39:13,132
I mean, clearly I
have enough space.

784
00:39:13,134 --> 00:39:14,800
And I...

785
00:39:14,802 --> 00:39:18,504
I swear once the club starts
making a profit,

786
00:39:18,506 --> 00:39:21,807
I will donate all
of Malcolm's money

787
00:39:21,809 --> 00:39:24,377
to an earthquake relief

788
00:39:24,379 --> 00:39:26,812
charity thing.

789
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:29,749
I can live with that.

790
00:39:32,687 --> 00:39:35,621
You got a TV in here?

791
00:39:59,681 --> 00:40:01,013
Well,

792
00:40:01,015 --> 00:40:03,316
I'm officially off.

793
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:05,184
I mean, my flight doesn't
leave till tonight,

794
00:40:05,186 --> 00:40:07,853
but I figured you'd be
working, so we can--

795
00:40:07,855 --> 00:40:10,156
we can just
say good-bye now.

796
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,860
You were right.

797
00:40:17,231 --> 00:40:19,298
- About what?
- I haven't always

798
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,599
been appreciative
of you.

799
00:40:20,601 --> 00:40:23,202
You were always
there for me every day,

800
00:40:23,204 --> 00:40:24,770
and night.

801
00:40:24,772 --> 00:40:27,673
So if I haven't said
thank you enough,

802
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:29,108
thank you.

803
00:40:30,712 --> 00:40:33,079
But you were
wrong, too.

804
00:40:33,081 --> 00:40:34,814
Mm-hmm?

805
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:37,883
When you said all you saw
in me was dad;

806
00:40:37,885 --> 00:40:41,053
there was nothing
of you in me.

807
00:40:41,055 --> 00:40:42,788
Well, I can't
really explain it,

808
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:45,057
but over the past two years,
I have been through a lot.

809
00:40:45,059 --> 00:40:49,228
And I have learned that I am a lot
tougher than I thought.

810
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:51,764
That...

811
00:40:51,766 --> 00:40:54,500
I get from you.

812
00:40:56,137 --> 00:40:58,537
don't cry.

813
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:00,706
So I took another look
at those cogeneration numbers.

814
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,541
You want to...

815
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:03,776
Oh.

816
00:41:03,778 --> 00:41:04,591
Hi again.

817
00:41:04,615 --> 00:41:05,712
Hi.

818
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,446
How's that new smart wearable
working out for you?

819
00:41:07,448 --> 00:41:08,814
Oh, it's, um,

820
00:41:08,816 --> 00:41:10,916
it's a real life saver.

821
00:41:10,918 --> 00:41:13,619
Yeah.

822
00:41:13,621 --> 00:41:16,389
Ray, I can't come
into work today.

823
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:18,491
I am...

824
00:41:18,493 --> 00:41:22,128
Calling in sick.

825
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:24,630
"Feel better."

826
00:41:24,632 --> 00:41:26,899
Thank you.

827
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:28,834
Thank you.
See you later.

828
00:41:35,843 --> 00:41:38,344
That's actually
pretty genius.

829
00:41:38,711 --> 00:41:41,879
Hello, Sara.

830
00:41:45,061 --> 00:41:47,962
What are you
doing here?

831
00:41:58,697 --> 00:42:04,697
