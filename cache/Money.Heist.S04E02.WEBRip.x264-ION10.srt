1
00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:20,881
There are always happier days
to remember.

2
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,500
The more fucked you are,
the happier those days seem to be.

3
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:28,633
While hoping for a miracle

4
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:31,208
and hearing the beep
of Nairobi's vital signs,

5
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:35,541
I remembered those days,
like the soccer match at the monastery.

6
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:38,415
- Keep up the defense. One minute left.
- Come on.

7
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,420
- Hey!
- Come on.

8
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,460
Go.

9
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:42,996
Take this.

10
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:47,503
I never imagined the seconds before
a corner kick could be so much fun.

11
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,170
Hey!

12
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,830
Ref, he touched my balls!

13
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:51,996
You saw that.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Please! Enough. There's a minute left.
Are you going to waste it arguing?

15
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:59,083
I was defending.
He was glued to my ass!

16
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:01,376
I saw you touching his balls, pig.

17
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:04,828
That's enough!
Don't touch him again... anywhere, OK?

18
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:06,826
- Or you'll be sent off.
- OK, go.

19
00:01:06,916 --> 00:01:07,746
Come on, go!

20
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:10,828
It's a goal!

21
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:13,251
Penalty!

22
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:16,253
- Let's see what happens.
- There's gonna be a fight.

23
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:19,378
There we go!

24
00:01:19,458 --> 00:01:21,918
Penalty and a red card.
Get out of here!

25
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:27,043
- Tokyo!
- Go.

26
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,750
- There's no signal. Everything's down.
- What do we do?

27
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:35,383
- We're losing her.
- No, fuck!

28
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:00,415
Carefully.

29
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:02,208
Slowly.

30
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,830
OK, I have it.

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,250
A little bit higher.

32
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:09,915
You're doing really well.

33
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:12,253
Now remove the bullet.

34
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:15,711
Go on.

35
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,420
That's it.

36
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:21,251
Good.

37
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:22,963
Be careful. That's it.

38
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:24,878
There it is.

39
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:52,126
That is nostalgia...

40
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:57,415
Finding out that past events
you hadn't even imagined were happiness

41
00:02:58,083 --> 00:02:58,923
actually were.

42
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:10,381
Yeah!

43
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:18,751
We hadn't even
reached the end of the first half,

44
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:23,213
and Lisbon was 3 kilometers from the tent
and forced to switch jerseys.

45
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:25,416
Goal by Sierra into the top corner.

46
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,415
Meanwhile, like robots,

47
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,290
we removed a piece of Nairobi's lung.

48
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,670
We didn't know
if we were saving her life

49
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,210
or finishing her off.

50
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:40,251
A second teammate down.

51
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:42,918
And a second goal against us.

52
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,958
And the third was yet to come,
from Palermo.

53
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:49,996
But it'd be on our side.

54
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:59,078
He had been a good captain.

55
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,375
But he was an awful team player.

56
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,460
The only thing resembling the plan
was the Professor's arrival in Madrid.

57
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:34,495
But not even that was right.
A rider was missing.

58
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:36,753
Professor...

59
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:38,378
we have to go.

60
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:55,706
By motorbike and along forest trails,
dirt roads, and cattle routes,

61
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:58,331
they crossed La Mancha,
avoiding checkpoints.

62
00:04:58,416 --> 00:04:59,876
The knight and his squire,

63
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:04,578
defeat after defeat, advancing towards
a battle of fools in this unwinnable war.

64
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:07,956
Meanwhile, everything
was about to explode.

65
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,330
Can you believe this?

66
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:37,171
Me, pregnant.

67
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:40,498
Who would have thought?

68
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:42,578
Congratulations.

69
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:44,785
Thank you.

70
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:52,751
Seriously...

71
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:56,076
you're very brave, you know?

72
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:57,883
I did what I had to.

73
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:00,958
Unless we make a stand,
they'll trample us like in Auschwitz.

74
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:03,035
If it stings too much, tell me.

75
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:06,825
Go ahead, put alcohol on it.
I can handle pain. I'm used to it.

76
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:09,038
Let's see...

77
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:14,246
Keep going.

78
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:44,503
Have you lost your mind?
You beat the crap out of him.

79
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:48,286
- You can't lose it like that!
- How can I not? This is a pressure cooker.

80
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:49,285
Exactly!

81
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:53,535
That's why you can't come to blows
with people, like a spoiled brat!

82
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:00,788
You have blood... Your top's...

83
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,501
Don't worry about me.
I can't see with this eye.

84
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:14,166
Listen, Amanda...

85
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:18,133
have you had any anxiety attacks
because of the heist?

86
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:23,206
- Well... I think so.
- I see.

87
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:28,575
And I can't sleep
for more than 30 minutes straight.

88
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:31,416
Because I have a knot right here,
and I...

89
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:36,076
That's normal in these cases.

90
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:38,246
There's a lot of tension.

91
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:42,786
A lot of tension. But don't worry,
I'll get you some sedatives.

92
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:49,498
We don't want you getting PTSD,
because it's so hard to get over.

93
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:51,173
In fact, sometimes...

94
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:53,078
it lasts forever.

95
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:58,205
Let me help you.
You have some blood here.

96
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:05,001
Don't worry, while I'm around...
you'll have everything you need.

97
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:10,536
You'll be my personal project.

98
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:18,078
We're holding up the Bank of Spain.
Maybe you've forgotten, but I haven't.

99
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:21,246
- We never acted like dicks before.
- Maybe I'm traumatized.

100
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:24,133
Maybe that's what's up.
We're all traumatized.

101
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,665
What the fuck do you mean?
What's my trauma?

102
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:29,503
- I'm not...
- Tell me.

103
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:30,793
You broke up with Tokyo.

104
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:34,173
How many guys do you know
who would leave Tokyo?

105
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:36,831
None, because you don't leave Tokyo.

106
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,083
What do you know about Tokyo?

107
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:44,076
Tokyo is a fucking Maserati.
Everyone wants one.

108
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:45,956
If you leave one in the street

109
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:49,631
with the doors open and keys in it,
you've gotta be fucked up.

110
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:54,628
Look, Rio.
I'm gonna make this very clear.

111
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Maybe your trauma comes
from them affecting your manhood.

112
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:03,128
Maybe they pushed you too far...
with the torture.

113
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:08,036
You need to let it out.
That's why you left Tokyo, isn't it?

114
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:12,330
If one person did it or if it was a group,
the trauma it causes is different.

115
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:13,416
Let it out!

116
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:19,580
You can count on me...
for whatever you need.

117
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,210
Anything.

118
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,580
Ladies and gentlemen...

119
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:43,825
I regret to inform you
that I must say goodbye.

120
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:45,035
I'm leaving.

121
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:49,916
- Keep up the good spirits.
- What the fuck are you doing?

122
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:52,213
Matías...

123
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:54,501
I'm leaving.

124
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,706
Pleasure working with you, as always.

125
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:02,625
I would even say...

126
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,915
that I love you a lot, Matías.

127
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:08,286
As for all of you...

128
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,290
I hope my leadership
hasn't been too traumatic.

129
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:15,575
You can tell your grandchildren
and loved ones this story. Anyway...

130
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:17,671
Ladies and gentlemen,

131
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,423
it's been a pleasure.

132
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:26,786
What the...?

133
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,035
Calm down.

134
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:37,631
Palermo, calm down.

135
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:41,633
Let's talk... calmly.

136
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,333
But you're not leaving.

137
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,670
Fucking hell!

138
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:56,881
You staged a coup d'état, you bitch!
What did you expect?

139
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:00,458
I'm in charge of the military side,
you're in charge of the technical.

140
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:01,711
The technical side?

141
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:06,383
Do I look like
some nerdy engineer with glasses?

142
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:10,918
What sort of orders would I give?

143
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,498
Now melt, now don't!

144
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:17,043
Bathyscaphe out! Bathyscaphe in!
Immersion! Emersion!

145
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:20,706
Who the fuck do you think I am?

146
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:25,330
I didn't come here for this shit!
This is beneath me. I'm off.

147
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:32,458
I'm activating the manual door,
and I'm doing you a favor.

148
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,880
Because if I stay,
I'll shoot the shit out of you

149
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:38,418
and the rest of them.

150
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:42,375
I'm not on your side anymore.

151
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:56,495
It's me who's doing you a favor.
Because I swear, the next thing I'll do...

152
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,960
is kill you.

153
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:00,583
I don't think so.

154
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:02,831
I think so.

155
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,713
Claymore mines...

156
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:16,458
which, as you can see...

157
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:19,206
are pointing towards you.

158
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:21,133
They won't get me.

159
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:25,455
You know I have no qualms
about killing you.

160
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:27,381
Easy.

161
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:29,418
You can't betray us like this.

162
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:31,328
Do you want to bet?

163
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:36,536
Palermo! Don't move!

164
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:38,495
Oh, good.

165
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:42,583
The mad princess came
to wave her prince goodbye at the station.

166
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:44,496
Have some dignity!

167
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:48,168
Where are you going? To prison?

168
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,576
To be shot in the forehead?

169
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,580
To sell us out?

170
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:55,206
I won't sell anyone out.

171
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:57,581
I have a safeguard, state secrets.

172
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:59,286
I won't betray you.

173
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:00,785
Leaving is betrayal.

174
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,291
Leaving us alone here is betrayal.

175
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:05,205
Don't...

176
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:07,711
move, I don't want to kill you, big man.

177
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:10,456
You don't want to kill me?

178
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,750
You'll have to kill me.

179
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,875
What you're doing is crazy, Helsinki.

180
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,423
If you leave, Palermo...

181
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:26,791
I swear...

182
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:29,753
I'll go boom...

183
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:32,173
boom... ciao.

184
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:38,328
I'm serious, Palermo. I will.

185
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:46,208
Seriously.

186
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:51,665
I got you.

187
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:14,916
What the hell did you say to Rio?

188
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,540
- About what?
- You told him he's traumatized.

189
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:20,418
Call it what you like,
but something's up.

190
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,750
Something's up?
Because he left Tokyo?

191
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:25,383
- Because she's a... Maserati.
- Look...

192
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,828
The Maserati thing is the way guys talk.

193
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:32,416
What I'm saying is
something happened during the torture.

194
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:36,036
- They pushed him too far.
- They did what?

195
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:38,665
Forty sweaty guys opened his back door.

196
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:40,458
In his back door.

197
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:44,461
Rio was tortured,
and you go and give him all that shit.

198
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:47,251
It's true.
I asked if they crossed the line.

199
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:51,383
Know what? He went quiet
because he can't face it. A textbook case.

200
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:52,288
No.

201
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:55,003
I can't.

202
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:57,291
You can't what?

203
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,915
You know? All of a sudden I feel...

204
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:04,753
- as if the bubble has burst.
- What bubble?

205
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:05,826
What bubble?

206
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:10,131
No, I want to know
what bubble we're talking about.

207
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:11,326
What bubble?

208
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:17,171
It's as if a blindfold
has fallen from my eyes.

209
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:20,125
I don't recognize you.

210
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:25,251
I don't know what we're doing together.
I don't know who you are.

211
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:27,826
Mónica... don't get me wrong.

212
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:31,168
Tokyo may be a Maserati,
but it doesn't mean you're a 600.

213
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:37,628
I'm sorry, Denver.

214
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:39,828
I can't stay with you.

215
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,460
Right.

216
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:03,415
When you see her coming at you,
angry like a hydra, shut up.

217
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:09,083
A hydra... A... Never mind.
Just keep your fucking mouth shut.

218
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:11,166
- And not defend myself?
- No.

219
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:14,040
Because you don't even know
why she's angry.

220
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,790
You, hush.

221
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:18,125
The less you know
what she's talking about,

222
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:19,248
the sorrier you are.

223
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:23,498
You say, yes, sorry darling,
to everything.

224
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:25,383
Now, that is a textbook case.

225
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:28,958
- From a textbook for the henpecked.
- No, for survivors.

226
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,881
You wait for the storm to pass.

227
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:33,878
When you work out
which way the wind is blowing,

228
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:36,578
and when she has calmed down,

229
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,833
then, and only then...

230
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,670
you make your move.

231
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,541
Didn't you see me before?

232
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:50,628
We've had problems since the monastery.
That's what's going on.

233
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:53,418
- Well...
- This has been building up.

234
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:57,040
And with all this pressure,
it all comes out.

235
00:18:58,708 --> 00:18:59,958
That's what's up.

236
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:18,631
Professor.

237
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,380
It's Tokyo.

238
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,420
- You just staged a coup d'état.
- Palermo's gone crazy.

239
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,000
He almost blew up the lobby.

240
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:34,923
- But we've got it under control.
- You don't.

241
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,500
You can't control him.
He's unpredictable.

242
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,673
He's tied up and under surveillance 24/7.

243
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,080
Tokyo, the plan is falling to pieces!

244
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,416
I'm still here, Professor.

245
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,130
So what?

246
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:49,828
Without Palermo,
we can't get the gold out.

247
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:51,536
Do you know how to do it?

248
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,210
And without Nairobi!

249
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:55,128
And without Lisbon!

250
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:17,040
Palermo was leaving
because it's the only smart thing to do.

251
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:19,205
Professor...

252
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:22,041
you've been my guardian angel.

253
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,580
Now it's my turn.

254
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:30,036
How did it happen?

255
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:33,626
She died to protect me.

256
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:35,673
I'm really sorry.

257
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:37,211
I...

258
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:41,133
was camouflaged
in a tree, and there were...

259
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:45,251
soldiers and police officers everywhere.

260
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,920
She was on a farm.
That's where they found her.

261
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:54,630
They made her kneel down, unarmed,
and they asked her about me.

262
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:57,288
I ran and ran.

263
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:59,575
They asked her, where's the Professor?

264
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,670
I said, tell them, Raquel.

265
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,580
Tell them where I am,
tell them I'll surrender, please.

266
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:11,333
I don't know.

267
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:14,285
She repeated, I don't know.

268
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:18,205
And they shot her twice.

269
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:23,245
She was unarmed,
and they shot her twice.

270
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:28,875
I didn't make it in time.

271
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:41,876
Did you see it?

272
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:44,825
You only heard it?

273
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:49,793
Professor,
did you see them moving her body?

274
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,205
I had to run.

275
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:53,035
Listen to me.

276
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,380
I also heard
my mother tell me to come home,

277
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:58,326
that I'd be safer there.

278
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:00,998
But 20 cops
were waiting in her kitchen.

279
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:06,536
And in the tent,
they also heard us fleeing from the bank,

280
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:08,958
but we're still here.

281
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:12,168
The only one who left
was a ferret with a hood.

282
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,788
Is there anything in the news?

283
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:18,245
Nothing.

284
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:23,038
The same as with Rio.

285
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:28,378
If they'd killed her, we'd know.

286
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:34,535
She's being interrogated.

287
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:39,996
- Where are you going?
- The Bank of Spain.

288
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:42,673
It's not a good idea. It's too risky.

289
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,250
I appreciate your concern,

290
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:48,793
but it's the only place I can find out
if my partner's alive. Move.

291
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:50,375
- No.
- I'm asking you.

292
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:52,248
- No, Professor.
- Move.

293
00:22:52,333 --> 00:22:54,793
I won't let you get on the motorbike.

294
00:23:05,541 --> 00:23:06,461
Seventy.

295
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:14,035
With what we have in those reports,
you'll be 70 when you're released.

296
00:23:15,333 --> 00:23:16,383
Paula will be 40.

297
00:23:17,166 --> 00:23:21,076
And your mother will be so long dead,
she'll be bones in a grave.

298
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:23,126
Stop, you don't need to go on.

299
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:26,876
The recommended sentence
depends on the prosecutor, not you.

300
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:29,291
And the final decision, on the judge.

301
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,880
But you know full well

302
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,750
that the prosecutor and the judge

303
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:39,876
work with what I write in these reports.

304
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:43,458
And I can write whatever I want.

305
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,710
What do you want me to write?

306
00:23:48,208 --> 00:23:50,788
You're going to make me
resort to violence.

307
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:53,415
- I'm protecting the plan.
- It's my plan.

308
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,130
This isn't the plan. It's improvisation.

309
00:23:56,208 --> 00:23:59,208
You always say, no improvising.

310
00:23:59,291 --> 00:24:01,041
I won't give in.

311
00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:03,293
You need to understand

312
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:06,165
that that's the only place
I can get answers.

313
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,420
In the Bank of...

314
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,130
Very well.

315
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:14,628
Seriously, Professor?

316
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:19,705
I don't know where the Professor is,
or what he'll do.

317
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:22,330
Can't you think?

318
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:25,461
Has love clouded your mind?

319
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:28,753
The plan includes this kind of firewall.

320
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,750
It's nothing to do with love.

321
00:24:31,833 --> 00:24:33,173
Of course it is.

322
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:37,330
But just think,
in prison, love drains away like water.

323
00:24:37,416 --> 00:24:40,746
It disappears fast.
In two months, it's all dried up.

324
00:24:40,833 --> 00:24:43,383
Two months of suffering
or a life in prison?

325
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:48,245
Even if you were reincarnated
seven times,

326
00:24:48,916 --> 00:24:51,326
you still wouldn't understand
our love.

327
00:24:51,416 --> 00:24:52,786
To protect the plan,

328
00:24:52,875 --> 00:24:55,495
we need to see
if she's being interrogated there.

329
00:24:55,583 --> 00:24:58,043
If so, it'll be Alicia Sierra doing it,

330
00:24:58,125 --> 00:25:00,995
and she'll be at the Bank of Spain.

331
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:03,208
But you can't go!

332
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:07,290
Let me tell you
about the nature of your love.

333
00:25:07,625 --> 00:25:09,915
One in jail in Soto del Real,
the other in Cádiz,

334
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
waiting for a yearly conjugal visit.

335
00:25:12,083 --> 00:25:15,713
That's if you're lucky.
Because if we don't catch your lover,

336
00:25:15,791 --> 00:25:18,421
you won't ever fucking see him again.

337
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:23,330
Choose between that or getting out in time
to be a mother to your daughter.

338
00:25:23,416 --> 00:25:26,246
You're trying
to emotionally manipulate me.

339
00:25:26,333 --> 00:25:28,003
I'm just speaking the truth.

340
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,080
As always.

341
00:25:31,625 --> 00:25:33,415
To protect the plan, we must go.

342
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:37,380
How will you go to the tent
if your face is all over the news?

343
00:25:39,083 --> 00:25:40,423
Like everyone else.

344
00:25:41,916 --> 00:25:43,666
In a red jumpsuit and a Dalí mask.

345
00:25:44,333 --> 00:25:46,003
Oh, good.

346
00:25:47,875 --> 00:25:49,535
She won't betray us.

347
00:25:49,625 --> 00:25:50,745
Give me your hand.

348
00:25:54,708 --> 00:25:55,788
Give me your hand.

349
00:25:59,166 --> 00:26:02,286
How many times have you thought
you'd fallen in love before?

350
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:10,286
The same will happen this time,
and you know it.

351
00:26:17,291 --> 00:26:20,211
Everyone is capable of betrayal,
Marseille.

352
00:26:20,291 --> 00:26:21,711
You only have to know...

353
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:27,786
That was quite a punch...
I thought we were finished.

354
00:26:28,333 --> 00:26:29,173
Were we?

355
00:26:30,125 --> 00:26:30,995
I didn't know.

356
00:27:15,875 --> 00:27:18,625
- Have some more to drink.
- I've had two.

357
00:27:18,708 --> 00:27:19,958
You look so serious.

358
00:27:21,208 --> 00:27:23,208
This is a weird wedding, Andrés.

359
00:27:23,291 --> 00:27:24,541
It's a great party!

360
00:27:24,625 --> 00:27:26,875
- Brother!
- I feel bad for her. She's young,

361
00:27:26,958 --> 00:27:29,828
and she's in love, but you're sick.

362
00:27:29,916 --> 00:27:33,826
Didn't you hear the priest?
Till death do you part.

363
00:27:35,791 --> 00:27:38,251
Maybe for you it's the grand finale,

364
00:27:38,333 --> 00:27:41,543
but for her, it's the beginning,
and it isn't a fair one.

365
00:27:42,541 --> 00:27:44,381
She knows I'm sick.

366
00:27:44,458 --> 00:27:46,458
Everyone knows I'm sick.

367
00:27:46,541 --> 00:27:48,791
You're betraying her feelings.

368
00:27:50,583 --> 00:27:54,133
I'll give her
the best two or three years of her life.

369
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:58,170
Yes, and after that...
Actually, I will betray her in a way.

370
00:27:59,791 --> 00:28:00,831
Anyway.

371
00:28:00,916 --> 00:28:03,286
Betrayal is an inherent part of love.

372
00:28:03,666 --> 00:28:06,036
Since we're on the subject, have a look.

373
00:28:06,125 --> 00:28:06,995
Martín.

374
00:28:08,375 --> 00:28:11,375
What a legend! My best friend.
He's happy.

375
00:28:11,708 --> 00:28:13,078
Would he betray me?

376
00:28:15,208 --> 00:28:16,708
Of course he would,

377
00:28:16,791 --> 00:28:19,381
in the right circumstances.
Tatiana?

378
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:22,583
Tatiana would too.

379
00:28:22,666 --> 00:28:28,286
You say you experience love,
but you only see traitors everywhere.

380
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:29,915
No, I'm not saying that.

381
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:35,630
I'm saying, betrayal doesn't depend on
how or how much you love someone.

382
00:28:35,708 --> 00:28:39,628
It depends on
how difficult your dilemma is.

383
00:28:40,041 --> 00:28:42,711
Would you betray your beloved?
In theory, no.

384
00:28:42,791 --> 00:28:45,381
But what if you were told
that if you did,

385
00:28:45,458 --> 00:28:48,748
you'd be given a drug
to save your beloved brother?

386
00:28:50,916 --> 00:28:52,576
That is a real dilemma.

387
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,630
Sergio Marquina. Emotional coldness.

388
00:29:22,666 --> 00:29:24,576
Compulsive narcissism.

389
00:29:24,958 --> 00:29:26,708
Pathological shyness.

390
00:29:27,125 --> 00:29:28,705
Psychopathic traits...

391
00:29:31,125 --> 00:29:32,705
- In short, a gem.
- Well.

392
00:29:33,666 --> 00:29:37,076
A report written by a mock expert
without interviewing the subject.

393
00:29:37,833 --> 00:29:41,133
He's much more fun
than what it says there.

394
00:29:42,291 --> 00:29:43,131
Cool.

395
00:29:44,416 --> 00:29:46,956
Yeah, a psychopath can be so much fun.

396
00:29:48,125 --> 00:29:49,455
Then there's your profile.

397
00:29:50,916 --> 00:29:52,206
What about it?

398
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:55,711
You're the caring type that gets attached
to this sort of jerk.

399
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:58,380
You idealize them.

400
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:04,383
Gradually, you get smaller by their side.
Then, they use and manipulate you.

401
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,580
When did you give up on
your gut instinct, inspector?

402
00:30:09,666 --> 00:30:12,166
Before the Professor came into your life?

403
00:30:13,208 --> 00:30:17,998
Because Alberto used to beat you up.
How does this one humiliate you?

404
00:30:19,875 --> 00:30:23,745
First you use my mother's Alzheimer's
and now domestic violence.

405
00:30:23,833 --> 00:30:28,583
Tell me the story is not repeating itself.
Tell me at some point it hasn't clicked,

406
00:30:28,666 --> 00:30:32,206
and you've thought, careful,
this guy could be a bastard.

407
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,630
Say it's not true.

408
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:38,380
You know about protocols and negotiation,
but so do I.

409
00:30:38,791 --> 00:30:40,081
I beat you, Raquel.

410
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:44,170
I must be a fool,
because I thought we had fallen in love.

411
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:45,460
I didn't ask you to come.

412
00:30:45,541 --> 00:30:46,921
It was a bluff.

413
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,380
She hung up,
and we didn't even play our hand!

414
00:30:49,458 --> 00:30:52,038
She went for you
because you're the weakest link.

415
00:30:54,166 --> 00:30:55,536
What's he done for you?

416
00:30:55,625 --> 00:30:58,205
Would he go to an island
with his family for you?

417
00:30:59,375 --> 00:31:01,375
Would he follow a plan of yours?

418
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:06,790
Have you ever been the protagonist?
Ever?

419
00:31:08,041 --> 00:31:10,671
Or have you always followed him
like a puppy?

420
00:31:11,208 --> 00:31:14,248
I warned you about Alberto.
He was a son of a bitch.

421
00:31:15,208 --> 00:31:16,668
And this guy's the same.

422
00:31:18,041 --> 00:31:20,171
The question is very simple, Raquel.

423
00:31:22,041 --> 00:31:24,541
Do you deserve to spend
30 years in prison

424
00:31:25,125 --> 00:31:27,035
for an idiot in a mask?

425
00:31:33,416 --> 00:31:34,326
Colonel...

426
00:31:35,791 --> 00:31:39,251
I've been checking the reports,
and it may be my mistake,

427
00:31:39,333 --> 00:31:42,463
but I can't find
the records for Murillo's arrest.

428
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,420
- You've been checking what?
- I don't want a technicality...

429
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,710
Well, you know...
it's a question of human rights.

430
00:31:49,791 --> 00:31:52,881
What's wrong with you?
Did you join an NGO?

431
00:31:52,958 --> 00:31:55,248
Amnesty International?
Cut the crap.

432
00:31:55,333 --> 00:31:57,043
But according to the law...

433
00:31:57,125 --> 00:32:00,285
Do you know
when we start applying the law in here?

434
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:02,960
Can you guess?

435
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,750
Give me an answer.

436
00:32:06,166 --> 00:32:08,166
- When you...
- Fucking say so.

437
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:10,790
Specifically, whenever I fucking want to.

438
00:32:10,875 --> 00:32:14,665
I don't give a shit about arrest reports
or procedural guarantees.

439
00:32:16,458 --> 00:32:18,288
Do you understand?

440
00:32:19,666 --> 00:32:21,416
Yes, I do.

441
00:32:24,458 --> 00:32:25,918
So until then...

442
00:32:27,791 --> 00:32:32,921
Until then, that bitch will be sat there
with no sleep, peeing in a bucket.

443
00:32:33,666 --> 00:32:35,166
Got a problem with that?

444
00:32:35,375 --> 00:32:37,745
No... no problem.

445
00:32:37,833 --> 00:32:40,133
Good, Antoñanzas. Good.

446
00:32:44,583 --> 00:32:46,173
TRANSPARENCY

447
00:32:51,416 --> 00:32:53,036
GIVE ME A RAISE

448
00:32:56,333 --> 00:32:58,753
LONG LIVE EVIL
LONG LIVE CAPITAL

449
00:32:58,833 --> 00:33:01,923
This system does not represent us!

450
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,830
The Professor would've loved x-ray vision
to see if Lisbon was behind the canvas.

451
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,580
But he wasn't Superman.

452
00:33:08,666 --> 00:33:11,576
So he had to make do
with being Sherlock Holmes.

453
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,380
He arrived at the bank
in search of a thread to pull.

454
00:33:15,458 --> 00:33:16,578
And he found three.

455
00:33:17,708 --> 00:33:19,958
The van.
What was it doing there?

456
00:33:21,125 --> 00:33:22,915
And why did it have mud on it?

457
00:33:23,833 --> 00:33:26,173
CNP85600N.

458
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:28,250
Pakistan found the answer.

459
00:33:28,333 --> 00:33:30,923
The van belonged
to the police in Huelva,

460
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,880
near where Lisbon
had supposedly been killed.

461
00:33:37,291 --> 00:33:38,171
Ángel.

462
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,210
If anyone should have been following
the Hamelin plan trail, it was him.

463
00:33:44,583 --> 00:33:47,173
Unless he had
something more important to do.

464
00:33:47,541 --> 00:33:49,541
Like transferring Lisbon to Madrid.

465
00:33:50,041 --> 00:33:54,131
If anyone should have been mourning
a friend's death, it was also him.

466
00:33:58,333 --> 00:34:01,753
And Alicia Sierra.
The truce had been declared hours ago.

467
00:34:01,833 --> 00:34:03,383
But there she was.

468
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:05,418
As much of a workaholic as she was,

469
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:08,830
she should have been home
soaking her ankles.

470
00:34:09,958 --> 00:34:12,038
Unless she got off on interrogating

471
00:34:12,125 --> 00:34:15,035
one of the most-wanted criminals
in the country.

472
00:34:16,708 --> 00:34:18,128
Lisbon might be alive.

473
00:34:18,708 --> 00:34:20,328
But he needed to check

474
00:34:20,416 --> 00:34:23,286
and let her know
he wouldn't abandon her.

475
00:34:41,875 --> 00:34:44,875
The ambulance you used
as a communication center arrived.

476
00:34:48,625 --> 00:34:50,375
Know who'll inspect it?

477
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:57,580
Alberto, your ex-husband.

478
00:34:59,041 --> 00:35:00,791
Besides being the best CSI,

479
00:35:00,875 --> 00:35:04,035
he's very eager
to fuck your life up even more.

480
00:35:05,333 --> 00:35:06,673
There's another option.

481
00:35:14,708 --> 00:35:20,208
I could go in there before anyone else
and get rid of all the evidence.

482
00:35:28,791 --> 00:35:30,331
You won't find anything.

483
00:35:35,791 --> 00:35:36,961
Shit, Raquel.

484
00:35:38,333 --> 00:35:39,463
You should know.

485
00:35:41,583 --> 00:35:43,133
We always find something.

486
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:48,210
We'll find a clue that leads us
to your mom and daughter.

487
00:35:48,958 --> 00:35:49,998
You'll see.

488
00:36:44,541 --> 00:36:48,211
Next five, get ready
to go to the bathroom with my colleague.

489
00:36:58,958 --> 00:37:02,748
Hey, Gandía, now we're on the same team,
may I ask a question?

490
00:37:02,833 --> 00:37:06,793
I'm confused.
Are we the good guys or the bad guys?

491
00:37:09,666 --> 00:37:11,576
I'll cut your nutsack open,

492
00:37:11,666 --> 00:37:15,286
pull out your balls,
and shove them in your mouth.

493
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:16,996
That'd be interesting.

494
00:37:17,708 --> 00:37:19,918
But your hands are tied up, buddy.

495
00:37:30,125 --> 00:37:34,995
Did you know the reliability of handcuffs
is based on one anatomical feature?

496
00:37:36,333 --> 00:37:38,583
The metacarpal stops them coming off.

497
00:37:39,791 --> 00:37:43,131
But it's very easy to dislocate it.

498
00:37:44,416 --> 00:37:46,456
- Really?
- Well...

499
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
they're ideas for freedom.

500
00:37:50,791 --> 00:37:52,331
<i>Free</i>

501
00:37:53,333 --> 00:37:55,793
<i>Like the sun at dawn</i>

502
00:37:55,875 --> 00:37:58,125
<i>I'm free</i>

503
00:37:58,458 --> 00:38:01,418
<i>Like the sea</i>

504
00:38:01,708 --> 00:38:03,668
<i>Free</i>

505
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:07,540
<i>Like the bird that escaped
from its prison</i>

506
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,040
<i>And can finally fly</i>

507
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:12,880
<i>Free</i>

508
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:15,328
<i>Like the wind that gathers</i>

509
00:38:15,416 --> 00:38:19,376
<i>My lament and my regret</i>

510
00:38:19,458 --> 00:38:21,458
<i>I walk endlessly</i>

511
00:38:21,916 --> 00:38:25,826
<i>In search of the truth
and I'll finally know</i>

512
00:38:25,916 --> 00:38:29,626
<i>What freedom is</i>

513
00:38:33,583 --> 00:38:34,673
Go to sleep.

514
00:38:37,958 --> 00:38:39,668
Four corners to my bed,

515
00:38:40,875 --> 00:38:42,955
four angels round my head.

516
00:38:43,333 --> 00:38:45,633
Luke, Matthew, and Joseph,

517
00:38:46,125 --> 00:38:48,285
our Lord and the Virgin Mary.

518
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,210
Antoñanzas.

519
00:39:10,041 --> 00:39:11,171
Why are you here?

520
00:39:12,625 --> 00:39:13,625
You're...

521
00:39:15,541 --> 00:39:16,831
You're under arrest!

522
00:39:21,541 --> 00:39:22,711
On your knees.

523
00:39:24,041 --> 00:39:25,831
I was only testing the waters.

524
00:39:27,625 --> 00:39:29,075
On your knees.

525
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:39,250
Please, my wife and daughters are in bed.

526
00:39:40,333 --> 00:39:41,793
They'll be fine.

527
00:39:43,625 --> 00:39:47,325
You just have to follow instructions
and answer some questions.

528
00:39:48,208 --> 00:39:51,078
I won't speak to someone
who has a gun to my head.

529
00:39:53,125 --> 00:39:54,245
You will speak.

530
00:39:57,416 --> 00:39:59,706
We've got, one...

531
00:40:01,666 --> 00:40:02,666
The ambulance.

532
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,250
Two...

533
00:40:10,208 --> 00:40:11,748
The dotty grandma.

534
00:40:12,458 --> 00:40:15,458
Where am I?

535
00:40:15,541 --> 00:40:16,711
I can't do it.

536
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:20,670
Three, the motherless child.

537
00:40:21,125 --> 00:40:22,125
Mommy.

538
00:40:22,791 --> 00:40:24,961
Mommy.

539
00:40:26,125 --> 00:40:27,125
Four...

540
00:40:32,625 --> 00:40:34,955
The Professor's love,

541
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:39,383
which will last two days
once you're in prison.

542
00:40:42,166 --> 00:40:44,826
And now, the final scene.

543
00:40:49,625 --> 00:40:53,915
You're assaulting an officer.
You don't know what you're getting into.

544
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,080
We called a truce.

545
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,830
A truce can be
the most important part of a war.

546
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,500
I can't...

547
00:41:07,416 --> 00:41:08,536
I can't breathe.

548
00:41:12,833 --> 00:41:14,463
Pull yourself together.

549
00:41:15,666 --> 00:41:16,706
Calm down.

550
00:41:19,625 --> 00:41:20,535
I can't breathe.

551
00:41:23,375 --> 00:41:24,375
Marseille.

552
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:45,630
Better?

553
00:42:05,166 --> 00:42:06,416
If you cooperate,

554
00:42:07,416 --> 00:42:10,626
the prosecution will request 12 years,
you'll get 10,

555
00:42:11,333 --> 00:42:12,883
and you'll be out in five.

556
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:15,630
That's how your life could be.

557
00:42:16,791 --> 00:42:19,541
If you don't cooperate,
you'll get 30 years.

558
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,250
That's how your life will be.

559
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:26,581
Your choice, Inspector.
