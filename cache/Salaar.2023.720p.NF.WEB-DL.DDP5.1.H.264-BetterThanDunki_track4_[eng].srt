1
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,125
In a far-off place,

2
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:41,666
amidst vengeance and enmity...

3
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:44,625
flourished an inseparable friendship.

4
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,875
{\an8}Who is it?
Who?

5
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:50,750
Hey, Deva!
Forget it.

6
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:53,250
- Let's leave.
- Tell Me...

7
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:54,875
Who is it?

8
00:00:58,125 --> 00:00:58,958
Hey, Deva!

9
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,375
- Why did you touch him?
- Deva, stop!

10
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:08,208
Oh...

11
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:11,125
I thought you were bringing a huge army...

12
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,166
But you've brought only this guy.

13
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:18,500
Just because you are born to my father

14
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:20,500
doesn't mean you have the right
to wear that nose ring.

15
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:22,041
You have to earn it.

16
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,583
Just tell me what I need to do.

17
00:01:36,541 --> 00:01:38,625
Do you see that wrestler?

18
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:40,500
He is my champion wrestler.

19
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:43,250
He has never been brought down.

20
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:44,708
Any challenger here?

21
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:47,375
There is no man here?

22
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:48,583
Make him fall to the ground...

23
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:49,916
And I will give it back to you.

24
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:53,166
How is that even possible?
How can he make him fall to the ground?

25
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,625
Answer me, is there nobody here?

26
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:57,125
Absolutely no pressure.

27
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:59,333
The nose ring will remain
with me until then.

28
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:00,875
You can get lost...

29
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:03,541
Step-brother.

30
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,125
Rudra, you are making a mistake.

31
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:08,875
But I thought you knew me.

32
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:11,416
But, you don't know about him.

33
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:15,958
He is a maniac.

34
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:20,708
Before he does something to you,
give back my nose ring.

35
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:25,000
If there is anyone, come forward.

36
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:27,208
Oh, really!

37
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:28,833
What's he going to do?

38
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:31,416
Tell me!

39
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:33,416
Come on!

40
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:36,000
Is there no man here?

41
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:38,291
What is he even capable of?

42
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:49,791
At least, there is one man here.

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Get lost!

44
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,708
Hey, Deva!

45
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:01,250
I told you to get lost!

46
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:11,500
Deva!

47
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:18,041
He is dead now.

48
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:27,375
Deva!

49
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:54,250
Deva...

50
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,041
Stop!

51
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,083
Deva...

52
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,416
Deva?

53
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:15,416
Deva!

54
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:17,458
Deva, get up!
Deva!

55
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:19,208
Deva!

56
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,541
Deva!

57
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:25,708
Did he fall to the ground?

58
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:42,916
Let's help him.

59
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:44,000
Don't touch me!

60
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:57,125
Give it back!

61
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:02,791
Give it to me.

62
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,833
Touch his nose ring again...

63
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:17,500
It won't be an electric wire
in my hands next time...

64
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:21,583
it will be an electric pole.

65
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,958
Let's go!

66
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,208
In a far-off place...

67
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,208
If you lose a battle...

68
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:52,750
You lose everything.

69
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,625
I killed her husband.

70
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:15,166
- Hey, I should go first.
- No, I will go first.

71
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:21,708
- His wife belongs to me.
- No one touches her until I do.

72
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:23,833
Hey, listen! She is mine.

73
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:28,625
But I killed her husband with my
own hands, didn't I? She is mine.

74
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,750
Hey...

75
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,125
I won't spare anyone.

76
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:00,750
I will kill you all.

77
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:02,291
Go away from here!

78
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:11,041
Sir, don't stand in our way.

79
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:13,250
This is your father's order.

80
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,416
Nobody should disobey him.

81
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:17,375
It should happen.

82
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,625
Leave them right now, and in return...

83
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:33,458
I will give you one of my territories.

84
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:37,625
Varadha, think again.

85
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,166
I will give you Bharghat.

86
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:05,208
Bharghat is mine!

87
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,375
Bharghat is mine!
Bharghat...

88
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,041
- Out of all our territories...
- Bharghat belongs to me.

89
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,000
...that is the biggest territory.

90
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:14,416
That is exactly why
I gave it to him, Baba.

91
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:16,916
Bharghat is mine!

92
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:21,458
No one outside of here
should know about this.

93
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,000
Get lost now!

94
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,250
Hey, let's go.

95
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,916
Yeah! Bharghat belongs to me.

96
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:43,333
Deva...

97
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:47,958
I am here for you.

98
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:50,291
Don't worry.

99
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:53,791
You shouldn't stay here anymore.

100
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:55,333
You must leave immediately.

101
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:59,041
In a far-off place...

102
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:01,500
Even an unbreakable bond of friendship...

103
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,208
had to be broken.

104
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:06,541
Hey, make it quick.

105
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:10,500
Promise me...

106
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:13,666
that you will never
come back to this place.

107
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:20,416
You should forget whatever happened here.

108
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:24,416
Promise me.

109
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:34,041
Deva!
Deva!

110
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:43,833
For you, I will be a bait or...

111
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,166
be a shark.

112
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:51,333
For you, my friend...

113
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:54,291
whenever you call me...

114
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,666
I will come back to this place.

115
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:11,375
I don't know if you remember...

116
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,625
I used to tell you a story...

117
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:15,708
During the time of the Persian empire,

118
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:21,625
the Sultan wouldn't deploy his formidable
army no matter how big the problem is.

119
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:23,541
Instead, he would go to only one man.

120
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:28,333
He would bring whatever
the Sultan wished for...

121
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:31,958
and destroy whatever the Sultan rejected.

122
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,291
That man was called...

123
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:39,416
I remember, Baba.

124
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,083
Salaar!

125
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:20,500
He will come back again...

126
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:23,708
My Salaar!

127
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,666
The sun himself holding an umbrella

128
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:29,333
Came patting your shoulder

129
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:35,375
He pulls out the thorns from your feet
With the finesse of his teeth

130
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:41,375
He guards you like an eyelid
That is inseparable from the eye

131
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,250
Leaving the sky behind

132
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:47,458
He has come down to kiss the ground

133
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:53,333
He is the raindrop that never
Exposes you to the harsh sun

134
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:59,125
Even before you think of calling him,
He leaps into action for you

135
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:20,208
One is a sword

136
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:23,083
And the other is a conflict

137
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:29,166
One is a roar and the other a storm
Together they make deluge

138
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:32,291
One is strategy and the other an army

139
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:35,291
When they walk together
It's a great war

140
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:40,791
This is a friendship
Of love and loyalty

141
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:44,875
May it flourish a hundred years

142
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,125
{\an8}Please, come with me.
I'll show you the stock.

143
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,041
{\an8}Okay.

144
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,166
- Hello!
- Bilal!

145
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,708
My daughter is on her way to India.

146
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:00,750
Have you gone crazy?

147
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,416
- Why did you allow her to come to India?
- I didn't.

148
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:05,166
She left without my knowledge.

149
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,333
What if they get to know
she is coming to India...

150
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,416
There is no "what if".

151
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,958
They have been searching
for the past seven years.

152
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:11,375
They would've known by now.

153
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:12,958
Radha Rama...

154
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,375
Just because she has been
sitting quietly in a corner

155
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,583
doesn't mean she is harmless.

156
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:20,875
{\an8}You have no idea how powerful
Radha Rama is today.

157
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:24,708
{\an8}After all, Radha Rama's maid,
Obulamma alone

158
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,083
has the power to decide the fate
of elections in two or three states.

159
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:28,125
ELECTION CAMPAIGN

160
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:31,916
Speak.

161
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:33,000
We have finally found one...

162
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:34,708
but it's not him...
we found his daughter.

163
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,208
Hey!

164
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:45,625
Krishnakanth had created eight fake
passports for himself and his daughter.

165
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:48,500
And one of the passports has been used
to book a ticket from the US to India.

166
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:49,958
Tomorrow at 6 o'clock in the morning...

167
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:53,125
she's landing at the Lal Bahadur Shastry
International Airport, Babatpur.

168
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:57,375
Apart from this, Obulamma
has two notorious henchmen.

169
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:58,916
{\an8}Vedha...

170
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:00,833
{\an8}Krishnakanth's daughter
has come to India, sir.

171
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:03,791
Krishnakanth's daughter?

172
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:07,000
{\an8}Hazare...

173
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,333
{\an8}Tell me, Obulamma.

174
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:11,541
Krishnakanth's daughter
has come to India...

175
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:14,000
I want her at any cost!

176
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,375
- Jessy!
- Sir?

177
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,458
I am preoccupied with the elections.

178
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:21,291
Leave for Babatpur immediately.

179
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:22,250
Okay, sir.

180
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,666
For what you did to them seven years ago,

181
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,666
there is no way they will
spare your daughter now.

182
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:29,541
Please do something, Bilal.

183
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,875
But what can I do now?

184
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:35,250
Only you know his whereabouts.

185
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:38,666
But...

186
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:41,375
You remember the promise, Bilal?

187
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:48,583
Brother, show us the goods.

188
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:50,750
Get out! All of you, out!

189
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,416
You said you would show the goods...

190
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:53,458
Out!

191
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:22,458
The time has come to fulfill your promise.

192
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,166
I know you cannot come.

193
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,208
I need to bring someone to you.

194
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:28,000
Whatever you instruct me to do...

195
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:29,666
I will follow.

196
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,458
{\an8}Three vehicles at the airport parking.

197
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:54,541
{\an8}Done.

198
00:16:58,208 --> 00:16:59,875
In the street next to the airport...

199
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:02,416
There are two cars and a delivery van.

200
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:09,166
Come on... come on!

201
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:41,375
What is going on?

202
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:48,208
Hey... hey... who are you?

203
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:56,083
Hey! No, no, no... No!

204
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:58,458
Let's go!

205
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:01,500
Go, go, go!

206
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:19,750
Go, go, go!

207
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:00,125
Who are you?

208
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,333
Hey, hey!

209
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:04,333
What the hell is happening?

210
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:05,708
Why are they attacking me?

211
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:08,750
There must be some sort of a mistake.
D-Did you see them, they...

212
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:11,375
They just shot that guy in the middle
of the road in broad daylight...

213
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:12,708
Speak.

214
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:16,625
There is no time.
Listen to me carefully, Aadhya.

215
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:19,083
- Dad! Dad...
- The guy in front of you?

216
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:20,166
Do as he says.

217
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,166
I will get you out of there
very soon, my dear.

218
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:24,458
Don't call me under any circumstances.

219
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:25,583
No... Dad...

220
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,791
Listen to me, Dad.

221
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,250
No, no... no...

222
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,000
No... we need to call the cops!

223
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:31,458
We need to call the cops, please.

224
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:32,541
- You don't understand.
- Hey!

225
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:35,791
You shouldn't have come to India.
But you did!

226
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:37,500
You have no idea
what is happening here.

227
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,333
Even if I tell you,
you wouldn't understand

228
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:40,666
and we don't even have time for that.

229
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:42,208
In this situation...

230
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:44,375
There's only one person in India

231
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:47,208
who can protect you.

232
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:48,708
Mother!

233
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,333
She doesn't easily trust
or accept any outsider...

234
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,458
You will have to convince her.

235
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:16,125
Come what may...

236
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:18,375
she should never get to know who you are!

237
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:20,541
Good evening, Teacher.

238
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:23,208
This is Diya from Vijayawada.
She speaks Telugu.

239
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,500
A distant relative of our bank manager,
Mr Ajay Kumar.

240
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,500
She wants to teach English
to the kids in our school.

241
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:29,208
That post is vacant.

242
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:31,291
Let's employ her.
She will stay in your guest house.

243
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:33,333
Uh... only if you agree.

244
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:35,375
What is your qualification?

245
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:36,541
Uh... English literature.

246
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,166
Her AADHAAR Card...

247
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,125
Voter ID...

248
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:42,416
Class X, intermediate
and degree certificates...

249
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,875
I have verified them all, Teacher.
You can check them too.

250
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:46,583
Where did you work before this?

251
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,666
Siddhartha Convent.

252
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,666
Are you going to teach the kids?

253
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:52,833
Or her?

254
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:57,958
Where did you work before this?

255
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,500
Siddhartha Convent.

256
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:00,541
Why did you quit from there?

257
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:01,458
Actually...

258
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:04,208
In spite of you being highly educated, why
do you want to work in a place like this?

259
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:05,125
That's what I...

260
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:06,916
Mr Sarpanch,
I don't think she is up to the task.

261
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:08,500
She can leave.
We will find someone else.

262
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:20,666
What makes someone decide
to settle in a new city

263
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:21,875
is not that place...

264
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:23,750
but it's the people who live there.

265
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:28,166
I have roamed several places
and finally come here.

266
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:31,166
Like how you are apprehensive
of trusting an outsider...

267
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,000
I am very apprehensive as well.

268
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:37,291
Let us both take a chance.

269
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:39,208
If it doesn't work out...

270
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:41,875
I will leave.

271
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:49,083
You will stay next door.

272
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:52,291
You and the way you teach
should be liked by the children, not me.

273
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:54,083
You get three days' time.

274
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:57,333
If the children don't like you,
you must leave on the fourth day.

275
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:00,041
Hey, get up!

276
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,833
If you don't bring your parents tomorrow,
or don't turn up at school,

277
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,625
I will personally come and drag
each one of you.

278
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:07,625
Leave!

279
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:11,000
Don't tell lies.

280
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:12,750
Who is telling lies?

281
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:13,708
Hey, get going.

282
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:20,500
Children are like molten iron...

283
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,166
Mold them well,

284
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:28,750
they become lamps that spread light.

285
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:37,666
If you don't,

286
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:45,875
they become blood-shedding...

287
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,791
...swords.

288
00:23:31,166 --> 00:23:32,583
Get freshened up and come.

289
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:36,250
I will get you some food.

290
00:23:51,708 --> 00:23:52,958
I did as you instructed.

291
00:23:53,041 --> 00:23:54,916
She has agreed.
Please let me go.

292
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,625
Hey, Sarpanch!

293
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:09,375
- Jessy?
- Sir... that girl is missing...

294
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:20,375
{\an8}She hasn't been eating
since yesterday, madam.

295
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:23,833
I want him...

296
00:24:23,916 --> 00:24:24,791
I want him...

297
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,541
For the past seven years...

298
00:24:28,125 --> 00:24:31,375
you have been sitting
like this in darkness...

299
00:24:31,791 --> 00:24:33,291
on the floor...

300
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,541
trembling for vengeance.

301
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:48,416
I know for a fact that no hunger matches
the hunger for vengeance.

302
00:24:49,041 --> 00:24:51,250
Krishnakanth couldn't be traced.

303
00:24:52,541 --> 00:24:55,916
But his daughter has come down.

304
00:24:56,708 --> 00:24:59,166
Our men failed to catch her.

305
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:04,791
But no matter where she is, I'll find her
and make her kneel in front of you.

306
00:25:07,166 --> 00:25:09,416
Even to exact your revenge,

307
00:25:09,916 --> 00:25:12,791
you need to stay alive, Rama!

308
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,666
Our time has come.

309
00:25:46,208 --> 00:25:50,500
- I want him...
- Our time has come.

310
00:26:08,375 --> 00:26:10,458
Before searching for that girl

311
00:26:10,708 --> 00:26:12,750
they will make sure
she doesn't get out of India.

312
00:26:12,958 --> 00:26:14,625
- File a case against the girl.
- Please, sir!

313
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:15,666
It won't happen again.

314
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,166
- Charge her with murder.
- Murder...

315
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:19,250
- Whose murder should I mention, sir?
- Please, sir!

316
00:26:26,708 --> 00:26:27,708
Do your job.

317
00:26:29,166 --> 00:26:32,958
{\an8}They will file a case against her and
inform the Embassies and police stations.

318
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:34,541
{\an8}You got to take a look at this.

319
00:26:34,875 --> 00:26:37,000
{\an8}Aadhya Krishnakanth, 28 years old...

320
00:26:37,125 --> 00:26:40,416
{\an8}US National, murdered Jessy Bhagga
and fled near Varanasi outskirts.

321
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,583
{\an8}- Hey...
- Brother?

322
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:44,458
Send our men in all directions.

323
00:26:44,916 --> 00:26:47,833
Bus stations, railway stations, ports,
airports, highways, borders...

324
00:26:47,916 --> 00:26:49,250
Their men will be everywhere.

325
00:26:49,833 --> 00:26:53,125
- She shouldn't escape.
- Okay, boss.

326
00:26:53,541 --> 00:26:55,041
They will certainly find a way here.

327
00:26:55,166 --> 00:26:56,416
They are searching for this car.

328
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,625
Dismantle it immediately.

329
00:27:00,666 --> 00:27:03,083
{\an8}Could you find the vehicle
in which the girl was taken?

330
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,416
Found it on a CCTV footage.

331
00:27:09,416 --> 00:27:12,708
They left that van at a warehouse
and took a black SUV.

332
00:27:14,875 --> 00:27:17,375
Obulamma has already
instructed Hazare to find that girl.

333
00:27:18,125 --> 00:27:19,416
Why are we also searching for her?

334
00:27:19,708 --> 00:27:21,291
We are not looking for the girl...

335
00:27:21,583 --> 00:27:23,458
Nor are we looking for Krishnakanth.

336
00:27:24,875 --> 00:27:27,583
For the past seven years...
We are searching for him!

337
00:27:30,333 --> 00:27:32,500
We searched every nook
and corner of the country.

338
00:27:33,416 --> 00:27:36,625
We have access to every single
CCTV camera in the country.

339
00:27:37,541 --> 00:27:40,416
But not a single CCTV could capture him.

340
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,333
We don't know where he is.

341
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,166
But... What is the relation
between the girl and him?

342
00:27:45,583 --> 00:27:46,708
There is a relation!

343
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:49,375
Wherever she is...

344
00:27:49,791 --> 00:27:51,250
he is bound to be there.

345
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,833
Check where that vehicle is.

346
00:28:09,541 --> 00:28:10,666
Hello!

347
00:28:11,166 --> 00:28:13,000
Is anyone out there?

348
00:28:13,916 --> 00:28:16,166
- Good morning, Teacher.
- Good morning, Teacher.

349
00:28:17,875 --> 00:28:18,708
Ma'am.

350
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,125
Though we locked her in,
the English teacher has come today.

351
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,666
Someone locked the door from outside.

352
00:28:24,791 --> 00:28:26,791
- That's why I--
- Chandram.

353
00:28:26,958 --> 00:28:29,500
Take this teacher to her classroom
and tell her the syllabus.

354
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:31,375
- Yes, madam.
- Let's go.

355
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:35,458
Hitler has left.

356
00:28:39,833 --> 00:28:40,833
Take the syllabus.

357
00:28:40,916 --> 00:28:43,166
Take the children. Teach the class.

358
00:28:43,625 --> 00:28:44,500
And take care.

359
00:28:44,583 --> 00:28:46,291
Okay, y'all just stand--

360
00:28:51,291 --> 00:28:52,958
Sorry, sorry...

361
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,458
Come on.

362
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:10,125
Class is over!

363
00:29:13,791 --> 00:29:16,250
When the children have no interest,
why are you forcing them?

364
00:29:16,333 --> 00:29:18,625
I won't send him to school from tomorrow.
Do whatever you want.

365
00:29:21,083 --> 00:29:22,666
I will burn you all to ashes.

366
00:29:23,583 --> 00:29:26,958
What you guys are doing is a mistake.
Do you want them to become like you?

367
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:30,083
Hey! All of you are
attending school from tomorrow.

368
00:29:30,458 --> 00:29:31,416
Understand?

369
00:29:34,541 --> 00:29:36,458
She sounds crazy, doesn't she?

370
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:38,291
Even I used to think
about her the same way.

371
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:41,000
Most of those who live here
work in the coal mine.

372
00:29:41,208 --> 00:29:43,791
Their kids also used to work
in the same mine for daily wages.

373
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:46,125
Three or four years ago,
she came to this place

374
00:29:46,208 --> 00:29:49,625
and literally begged everyone
to get the school renovated and reopened.

375
00:29:49,791 --> 00:29:52,625
Since then, she has been educating all
the children in this school.

376
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,875
I must tell you about
another interesting person.

377
00:30:05,166 --> 00:30:08,333
Her son and her are like
the South Pole and the North Pole.

378
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,583
Hey, you! Are you blind?
Can't you see?

379
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:15,375
But it was your mistake.

380
00:30:15,625 --> 00:30:16,875
No problem, Uncle.

381
00:30:16,958 --> 00:30:17,875
Sorry, brother.

382
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:19,125
I will move back.

383
00:30:19,458 --> 00:30:21,333
Though he looks tall and imposing,

384
00:30:21,625 --> 00:30:24,625
he doesn't even retaliate
when someone behaves rudely with him.

385
00:30:24,708 --> 00:30:28,083
He doesn't mingle with anyone,
he doesn't talk to anyone, or get angry...

386
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,208
But when he is with kids...

387
00:30:32,333 --> 00:30:33,625
he becomes one of them.

388
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:35,875
What is this suspense?

389
00:30:35,958 --> 00:30:37,791
Should we wait for you so long
every single day?

390
00:30:37,875 --> 00:30:41,750
Hey, like a batsman sent to bowl,
they gave me all sorts of assembling work.

391
00:30:41,833 --> 00:30:43,375
Had they asked me
to disassemble something...

392
00:30:44,291 --> 00:30:45,541
I would've done it in a single strike.

393
00:30:45,791 --> 00:30:47,458
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

394
00:30:52,375 --> 00:30:53,833
Sixer!

395
00:30:53,958 --> 00:30:55,208
Salute!

396
00:30:58,208 --> 00:31:00,708
He hit a sixer against your bowling
and you are saluting him?

397
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:06,500
You are always playing with us.
Don't you have friends of your own?

398
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,125
Hey, pass me the ball.

399
00:31:53,916 --> 00:31:55,625
How many times should I tell you?

400
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,625
You should be home by 6:00 p.m.

401
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:03,291
I tell you once and isn't that enough?

402
00:32:03,875 --> 00:32:05,458
Do you need a daily reminder?

403
00:32:07,833 --> 00:32:09,333
If you repeat this one more time...

404
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,166
I won't be late from tomorrow, Mom.

405
00:33:05,708 --> 00:33:06,833
Excuse me.

406
00:33:09,416 --> 00:33:12,291
Bilal said I can leave today.

407
00:33:13,916 --> 00:33:15,000
Just one more day.

408
00:33:29,125 --> 00:33:34,166
I want him... I want him...

409
00:33:34,583 --> 00:33:41,333
I want him... I want him...

410
00:33:41,625 --> 00:33:43,916
I want him... I want him...

411
00:33:52,916 --> 00:33:54,208
Stop! Enough!

412
00:33:54,375 --> 00:33:55,916
Stop it... Just stop it!

413
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,583
Nobody can teach any of you.

414
00:33:57,791 --> 00:33:59,916
Why?
Why are you doing this to me?

415
00:34:00,166 --> 00:34:02,625
Very bad.
It's impossible to teach you.

416
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:03,833
So bad!

417
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,875
- Good morning, Teacher.
- Good morning, Teacher.

418
00:34:08,958 --> 00:34:09,833
Please, sit down.

419
00:34:10,625 --> 00:34:12,208
Your teacher is tired today.

420
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,875
She cannot teach today.

421
00:34:13,958 --> 00:34:15,583
She will go to the market
and get the lights.

422
00:34:23,125 --> 00:34:24,416
Only one run, man.

423
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,833
Where is the ball?

424
00:34:25,916 --> 00:34:27,041
Look there.

425
00:34:43,208 --> 00:34:44,083
Hey...

426
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:46,041
You are playing cricket without me?

427
00:34:47,041 --> 00:34:48,166
When will you come to play cricket?

428
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:49,291
I will make it tomorrow.

429
00:34:49,416 --> 00:34:51,166
Hey, let's go. Got the ball!

430
00:34:56,208 --> 00:34:57,791
You asked me to tell you if she goes out.

431
00:34:57,875 --> 00:35:00,083
Hitler has sent the English teacher
to the market.

432
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,291
Hello, hello! Madam!

433
00:35:04,416 --> 00:35:07,083
I bought you for double the price
just now... you can't go anywhere.

434
00:35:07,291 --> 00:35:08,958
You are my property.

435
00:35:09,541 --> 00:35:11,291
I am your owner.

436
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:14,166
Hey, you got me a nice property, man.

437
00:35:18,208 --> 00:35:19,375
Leave the girl alone.

438
00:35:21,083 --> 00:35:23,208
Hey! The hero is here.

439
00:35:24,041 --> 00:35:28,416
He is going to beat us all
and take her away.

440
00:35:28,833 --> 00:35:30,750
Look, look, look.

441
00:35:30,833 --> 00:35:33,833
Hit me, come on, hit me.

442
00:35:34,083 --> 00:35:36,000
Oh, it hurts!

443
00:35:36,708 --> 00:35:38,166
Oh, it hurts!

444
00:35:38,666 --> 00:35:40,750
It hurts really bad!

445
00:35:43,791 --> 00:35:46,416
I thought he is a hero.

446
00:36:06,958 --> 00:36:09,708
Hey, it's the cops!
Let's go, we'll get her later.

447
00:36:32,958 --> 00:36:35,416
{\an8}The vehicle was last seen
at the Navada toll in Bihar, sir.

448
00:36:35,583 --> 00:36:37,083
{\an8}We don't know
which way it went from there.

449
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,958
Where could it have gone?

450
00:36:41,583 --> 00:36:44,125
Send her picture to all our men.

451
00:36:44,291 --> 00:36:45,416
I will send it immediately, sir.

452
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:49,291
{\an8}What is taking Hazare so long?

453
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:53,000
{\an8}Is he not capable
of nabbing one helpless girl?

454
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:54,458
Madam, it's Nayak!

455
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,125
What is it, Nayak?

456
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:58,125
{\an8}Obulamma...

457
00:36:58,208 --> 00:37:00,416
{\an8}The consignment you were asking
about has arrived at Khandla Port.

458
00:37:00,541 --> 00:37:02,125
{\an8}Tell me when the delivery should be made.

459
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:05,416
{\an8}Didn't I ask you to deliver it to Nepal?

460
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:08,000
Don't call me again.

461
00:37:08,541 --> 00:37:09,541
Whatever comes up...

462
00:37:09,875 --> 00:37:11,500
Vedha will take care of it.

463
00:37:18,291 --> 00:37:19,208
That's it?

464
00:37:19,291 --> 00:37:21,875
Only these many?
They didn't even bring weapons with them.

465
00:37:22,833 --> 00:37:24,000
That one man is enough.

466
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:27,791
Hey, Nayak!

467
00:37:28,166 --> 00:37:29,000
How are you?

468
00:37:29,083 --> 00:37:30,625
It's a hundred million dollar consignment.

469
00:37:30,708 --> 00:37:31,583
A small one.

470
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:34,375
But if you deliver this properly,
you will get many more big deals.

471
00:37:34,583 --> 00:37:36,833
You are the right guy for this job.

472
00:37:38,916 --> 00:37:40,500
Nepal!

473
00:37:41,791 --> 00:37:42,625
Fine.

474
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:45,166
I will have a look at the Nepali girls.

475
00:37:48,291 --> 00:37:49,708
He doesn't even look interested.

476
00:37:50,166 --> 00:37:51,000
Hey.

477
00:37:51,333 --> 00:37:53,541
Don't disturb me until we reach there.

478
00:37:54,125 --> 00:37:54,958
Don't worry.

479
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:57,125
No one can stop the consignment
once he stamps that seal on it.

480
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,541
Will he be able to get out of the port?

481
00:38:19,166 --> 00:38:22,458
This is how you flush
a hundred million dollars down the toilet!

482
00:38:27,125 --> 00:38:28,458
Sir, sir!

483
00:38:28,625 --> 00:38:29,750
The cops have stopped us!

484
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:32,083
Open it!

485
00:38:42,958 --> 00:38:44,083
Hey, close the door!

486
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:45,416
Close the door!

487
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:48,916
Hey, let them go.

488
00:38:49,125 --> 00:38:50,041
Open it!

489
00:38:53,083 --> 00:38:54,583
What is it?

490
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,083
Nothing, sir.

491
00:38:59,541 --> 00:39:02,208
We were tipped off a month ago, sir.

492
00:39:03,208 --> 00:39:04,333
Why did we let them go, sir?

493
00:39:07,541 --> 00:39:09,125
Did you see the seal?

494
00:39:10,541 --> 00:39:13,458
Do you know where it came from?

495
00:39:15,375 --> 00:39:20,416
Before you could think of even saying
the name of the place, they will kill you.

496
00:39:22,791 --> 00:39:23,875
The seal?

497
00:39:24,375 --> 00:39:25,375
Who stopped it?

498
00:39:25,708 --> 00:39:29,166
Call the control room and tell them
nobody should stop the seal.

499
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,625
What are you saying, sir?

500
00:39:34,083 --> 00:39:34,916
The seal?

501
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:36,041
I will inform everybody immediately.

502
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:37,750
Send information to all the check posts.

503
00:39:37,916 --> 00:39:38,750
Yes, sir.

504
00:39:40,333 --> 00:39:42,458
I heard about it as a child.

505
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:45,791
That some tribes rule that place.

506
00:39:47,833 --> 00:39:50,416
That they have built huge
walls barring outsiders

507
00:39:50,541 --> 00:39:53,083
and that they have the largest army
with the most advanced weapons.

508
00:39:56,041 --> 00:39:58,625
But isn't that an urban legend?

509
00:40:01,166 --> 00:40:04,375
I don't know if that place exists or not

510
00:40:09,375 --> 00:40:16,000
but the fear we get when we hear its name
is absolutely true.

511
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:21,333
I told you.

512
00:40:22,041 --> 00:40:23,458
There is nobody in India

513
00:40:24,125 --> 00:40:25,541
who can stop that seal.

514
00:40:35,583 --> 00:40:36,416
{\an8}Cutout...

515
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,083
Hey, they're painting, be careful.

516
00:40:38,166 --> 00:40:40,666
Hey! Stop that.
It's my birthday today.

517
00:40:41,833 --> 00:40:45,208
Hey... Don't you know that you must
wish me exactly at midnight?

518
00:40:45,333 --> 00:40:47,666
Sorry, Pari. I forgot about it.
Happy birthday.

519
00:40:47,791 --> 00:40:49,083
Okay, fine. Come.
Let's cut the cake.

520
00:40:49,166 --> 00:40:50,291
You must come...

521
00:40:50,416 --> 00:40:52,541
- You should cut the cake.
- It's your birthday. You should cut it.

522
00:40:52,625 --> 00:40:54,333
No, you should cut the cake.

523
00:40:54,416 --> 00:40:55,791
- You must cut it.
- No. You must...

524
00:40:55,875 --> 00:40:57,666
Take this knife and cut it.

525
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:59,333
- Please cut the cake.
- Hey!

526
00:41:04,875 --> 00:41:06,666
Hey! Move out, quick!

527
00:41:11,666 --> 00:41:13,166
Hey!

528
00:41:35,166 --> 00:41:36,333
That thing...

529
00:41:37,875 --> 00:41:39,333
Give it to me.

530
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,541
Just for the sake of a knife!

531
00:42:19,333 --> 00:42:20,750
That too a plastic knife.

532
00:42:29,916 --> 00:42:30,916
Vijay...

533
00:42:31,208 --> 00:42:32,208
Yes, Teacher?

534
00:42:32,708 --> 00:42:34,541
You remember the song I taught you?

535
00:42:34,833 --> 00:42:36,000
Yes, Teacher.

536
00:42:36,916 --> 00:42:37,916
Sing it.

537
00:42:39,791 --> 00:42:44,750
In every story it's the demon
Who unleashes violence

538
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:50,625
And to oppress that demon
Rises a king...

539
00:42:51,083 --> 00:42:56,333
In his quest to quell the enemy
The king has embraced savagery

540
00:42:56,583 --> 00:43:01,916
He has made violence
A habit and forgotten kindness

541
00:43:02,041 --> 00:43:07,250
He slayed the monster,
Fighting resolutely

542
00:43:07,416 --> 00:43:12,833
Filled with ire, he has turned into
A monster himself

543
00:43:12,916 --> 00:43:18,416
Be determined
Dare the most powerful

544
00:43:18,541 --> 00:43:24,458
Time to prove your patience and skill
Forgiveness is a noble way to win

545
00:43:24,541 --> 00:43:29,958
Won't anger prove to be your weakness?

546
00:43:30,208 --> 00:43:35,208
Stop a war with a smile
And show the world

547
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:41,291
Your merits shall remain
Etched on time

548
00:43:41,458 --> 00:43:46,625
Like letters on stone

549
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:52,166
Your flaws shall be erased

550
00:43:52,708 --> 00:43:57,708
Like lines on sand

551
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:31,750
Chandram, Chandram!

552
00:44:32,166 --> 00:44:33,208
Where did he go?

553
00:44:33,375 --> 00:44:34,958
He has to take
Deva's lunchbox to the coal mine.

554
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:36,750
I shall take it.

555
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:40,791
Let me be useful at least for this.

556
00:44:55,583 --> 00:44:56,583
This girl?

557
00:44:58,208 --> 00:44:59,791
Sir, she is in my city.

558
00:45:00,166 --> 00:45:01,625
She is here in Tinsukia.

559
00:45:01,916 --> 00:45:03,791
- What happened?
- We found the girl.

560
00:45:03,958 --> 00:45:06,166
She is in Tinsukia, Assam.

561
00:45:06,333 --> 00:45:07,166
Tinsukia?

562
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:08,458
It is near the borders of Burma.

563
00:45:08,791 --> 00:45:10,375
There is a coal mine on the outskirts.

564
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:13,083
A lot of Telugu people have migrated
there to work in the mines.

565
00:45:14,458 --> 00:45:16,166
Are there any CCTVs in that town?

566
00:45:17,375 --> 00:45:18,500
It's a very remote place, sir.

567
00:45:18,625 --> 00:45:20,166
They don't even have
banks or post offices.

568
00:45:21,375 --> 00:45:22,333
Then...

569
00:45:22,666 --> 00:45:24,708
Maybe he too must be...

570
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:28,208
- Sir?
- Leave for Tinsukia immediately.

571
00:45:28,291 --> 00:45:29,125
Come on, guys.

572
00:45:30,375 --> 00:45:31,958
Who are you sending?

573
00:45:32,041 --> 00:45:32,916
I'm sending Selfie.

574
00:45:38,291 --> 00:45:39,166
Sir.

575
00:45:39,291 --> 00:45:41,458
Keep sending photographs from Tinsukia.

576
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:42,750
Okay, sir.

577
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:43,833
Let's go.

578
00:45:47,208 --> 00:45:50,083
Oh damn!, this girl is good for nothing.

579
00:46:05,458 --> 00:46:06,666
Actually, I was...

580
00:46:07,458 --> 00:46:08,500
I know.

581
00:46:09,541 --> 00:46:10,958
You are going to say
"one more day", right?

582
00:46:16,541 --> 00:46:17,666
- Baby...
- Hey!

583
00:46:19,166 --> 00:46:20,166
Smile!

584
00:46:21,583 --> 00:46:23,291
Wow! The selfie looks amazing.

585
00:46:27,875 --> 00:46:28,958
Come. Let's go.

586
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:30,250
Hey!

587
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Hey...

588
00:46:37,416 --> 00:46:38,458
Help!

589
00:46:45,625 --> 00:46:47,000
Is this the guy who brought her here?

590
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:49,333
Hey, he must have done that by mistake...

591
00:46:50,458 --> 00:46:51,958
He is not capable of doing that.

592
00:47:07,708 --> 00:47:10,208
My goodness! I don't know from
where the Sarpanch got this girl.

593
00:47:10,333 --> 00:47:11,666
She is absolutely good for nothing...

594
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:13,375
She took one box and forgot the other.

595
00:47:13,458 --> 00:47:15,625
She never does anything right.
Where is she?

596
00:47:21,833 --> 00:47:23,166
Hey, hey! Who are you guys?

597
00:47:23,291 --> 00:47:25,375
Where are you dragging her?
Let her go!

598
00:47:25,458 --> 00:47:26,375
I'm talking to you...

599
00:47:28,833 --> 00:47:30,125
Why are you guys not helping...

600
00:47:30,208 --> 00:47:31,250
Go, save the girl.

601
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:36,875
There are so many men here!

602
00:47:37,125 --> 00:47:38,750
Can't any of you save her?

603
00:47:40,166 --> 00:47:42,916
Oh, no! Please, can no one save her?

604
00:47:43,791 --> 00:47:45,166
You? What about you?

605
00:47:45,333 --> 00:47:46,166
You?

606
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:48,000
Please, someone stop them!

607
00:47:48,541 --> 00:47:50,458
No one will stop them and no one can.

608
00:47:53,875 --> 00:47:55,333
There is only one person
who can stop them.

609
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:57,916
And that's you.

610
00:48:02,375 --> 00:48:03,750
Oh, no! Oh, no!

611
00:48:03,833 --> 00:48:05,375
There are so many men out here.

612
00:48:05,458 --> 00:48:06,791
Is no one capable?

613
00:48:06,875 --> 00:48:08,041
Your son is here as well, right?

614
00:48:08,125 --> 00:48:09,666
Why don't you ask him? Isn't he a man?

615
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:15,500
Oh, damn!

616
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,000
We have left him behind.

617
00:48:18,416 --> 00:48:20,916
Cut his head off and bring it to me.

618
00:48:30,083 --> 00:48:33,375
The ash formed on the burning
coal needs to be blown away by the air

619
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,583
so that the heat inside can be felt...

620
00:48:44,208 --> 00:48:46,250
Hey, they are going to kill him.

621
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:13,333
What can the poor guy do?

622
00:49:13,541 --> 00:49:15,958
He is like an old rusty
vehicle that would never start.

623
00:49:26,416 --> 00:49:30,041
It was me who bound you
not to raise your hands on anyone.

624
00:49:34,791 --> 00:49:37,583
Now, I set you free
from any bounds whatsoever.

625
00:49:44,333 --> 00:49:45,458
Deva!

626
00:49:49,875 --> 00:49:51,041
They must stop.

627
00:49:54,375 --> 00:49:56,291
Either plead with them.

628
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:05,750
Or make them bleed.

629
00:51:41,791 --> 00:51:43,375
Like he said, just one strike!

630
00:53:28,208 --> 00:53:29,250
Does that hurt?

631
00:55:00,458 --> 00:55:02,541
Go upstairs and pack everything.
You need to finish packing by today.

632
00:55:02,625 --> 00:55:03,500
Okay.

633
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:15,000
I am responsible for all of this.

634
00:55:15,208 --> 00:55:18,375
I had convinced Deva
that she will be safe here.

635
00:55:18,583 --> 00:55:20,708
I don't care about that.

636
00:55:21,375 --> 00:55:25,583
Right now, all that matters to me
are my son and I, nothing else.

637
00:55:25,791 --> 00:55:28,708
Neither do I have the leisure
to think about anyone else's problems.

638
00:55:29,666 --> 00:55:32,875
Village after village, town after town,
city after city...

639
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,916
We have been moving
for the past seven years.

640
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:38,791
I thought we have finally found
some peace here.

641
00:55:39,875 --> 00:55:41,583
But now we have to get going again!

642
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:44,041
Where should we go from here?

643
00:55:44,541 --> 00:55:46,958
Tell me, speak up.

644
00:55:48,541 --> 00:55:50,958
Because of you, my son had to... again...

645
00:55:58,291 --> 00:56:00,041
Take that girl and go away, Bilal.

646
00:56:12,541 --> 00:56:13,583
This is my mother.

647
00:56:17,416 --> 00:56:19,208
I came to India for this.

648
00:56:20,041 --> 00:56:23,041
My mom always wanted to come to India.

649
00:56:24,041 --> 00:56:25,875
But my dad would never allow her.

650
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:29,125
And my mother's last wish...

651
00:56:30,208 --> 00:56:32,500
Was to bring her remains to India.

652
00:56:34,541 --> 00:56:36,416
I know I have asked you for a lot.

653
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,708
Can you do this
one last thing for me? Please...

654
00:56:49,625 --> 00:56:51,833
The children didn't like you, nor did I.

655
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:56,750
Take her away, Bilal.

656
00:57:14,166 --> 00:57:15,291
Obulamma.

657
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,083
That girl...

658
00:57:20,291 --> 00:57:23,791
None of these jerks can
do a simple job properly.

659
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:34,291
Rinda, there is a change
in the delivery point.

660
00:57:35,375 --> 00:57:38,791
{\an8}There is a check post near Budherabad,
under the control of the local Maoists.

661
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,458
{\an8}They are our men.

662
00:57:40,833 --> 00:57:43,583
Cross the check post and you
will reach the borders of Burma.

663
00:57:43,708 --> 00:57:45,375
Deliver it there.

664
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:48,750
Along with that consignment,
you need to bring a girl as well.

665
00:57:49,041 --> 00:57:50,000
Where is that girl now?

666
00:57:50,250 --> 00:57:53,500
On the way to that check post, you
will find a small town named Tinsukia.

667
00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:56,625
You should bring that girl from there.

668
00:57:57,041 --> 00:57:58,458
Don't forget the seal.

669
00:58:00,625 --> 00:58:03,083
East seems to be lucky for us.

670
00:58:04,708 --> 00:58:06,250
Drive towards that direction.

671
00:58:11,875 --> 00:58:13,708
The delivery point has been changed.

672
00:58:15,416 --> 00:58:16,666
Let's go there.

673
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:17,666
Hey!

674
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:19,666
- Sir.
- Let's go to the Burma border.

675
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:23,958
Once you cross the border...

676
00:58:24,041 --> 00:58:25,583
It's okay, Deva. I will take care.

677
00:58:31,291 --> 00:58:32,375
Deva.

678
00:58:33,208 --> 00:58:34,250
Let's get going.

679
00:58:51,625 --> 00:58:53,291
Krishnakanth!

680
00:58:53,708 --> 00:58:55,541
It's been so long since I saw you.

681
00:58:56,166 --> 00:58:57,250
How are you?

682
00:58:57,333 --> 00:58:58,750
It's me that you wanted, right?

683
00:58:58,833 --> 00:58:59,833
I am here.

684
00:58:59,916 --> 00:59:02,708
Kill me if you want
but please spare my daughter.

685
00:59:42,041 --> 00:59:43,541
- Seal...
- Okay, sir!

686
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Hey!

687
00:59:45,125 --> 00:59:47,791
Stamp the seal on the girl
and then put her in the truck.

688
00:59:57,083 --> 00:59:59,541
The girl is already in the truck.

689
01:00:00,083 --> 01:00:01,791
The seal has been stamped as well.

690
01:00:02,125 --> 01:00:04,208
They are bringing her here.

691
01:00:12,458 --> 01:00:14,458
I am anyway going to kill you.

692
01:00:14,791 --> 01:00:19,625
But before I do that, you must
watch your daughter die in front of you.

693
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:27,458
She can leave. We will find someone else.

694
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:29,125
Give me!

695
01:00:33,458 --> 01:00:36,041
The children didn't like you, nor did I.

696
01:01:02,875 --> 01:01:04,791
If they take us to Burma, we can't escape.

697
01:01:06,666 --> 01:01:08,708
Answer some of my questions first.

698
01:01:09,875 --> 01:01:11,791
Who are the people who want to kill me?

699
01:01:12,875 --> 01:01:14,250
What did my dad do to them?

700
01:01:15,083 --> 01:01:17,708
Why was I asked to stay with you guys?

701
01:01:18,375 --> 01:01:21,541
Why did his mother react
so much, over a plastic knife?

702
01:01:22,333 --> 01:01:24,916
Why doesn't he cross
the boundaries set by his mother?

703
01:01:25,875 --> 01:01:27,250
And what is this?

704
01:02:01,708 --> 01:02:03,250
Hold on to the pole.

705
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:05,250
What?

706
01:02:11,083 --> 01:02:12,125
Obulamma.

707
01:02:14,291 --> 01:02:17,166
If you know
who my daughter was with all these days,

708
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:18,958
you will release her.

709
01:02:37,375 --> 01:02:39,166
Hold on to the pole tightly.

710
01:03:58,916 --> 01:03:59,916
The trucks have been stopped...

711
01:04:01,166 --> 01:04:02,375
He has stopped the truck.

712
01:04:02,541 --> 01:04:04,666
Someone stopped the truck?

713
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:06,375
Who the heck is he?

714
01:04:06,666 --> 01:04:08,666
You should have hacked him on the spot.

715
01:04:18,250 --> 01:04:19,916
The person who stopped the vehicle is...

716
01:04:20,416 --> 01:04:21,625
Devaratha...

717
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:53,500
No one can do anything to him.

718
01:05:26,833 --> 01:05:27,833
Give it.

719
01:05:44,750 --> 01:05:48,166
You can stop a river with a dam but...

720
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,541
How can you stop a mighty ocean?

721
01:06:08,666 --> 01:06:12,291
I never told you about this, Obulamma.

722
01:06:12,583 --> 01:06:15,125
If I had, you would have definitely
stopped me from doing this.

723
01:06:15,458 --> 01:06:18,083
Thanks to your daughter, I found him...

724
01:06:18,375 --> 01:06:21,333
He should have been killed
the moment he was found, right?

725
01:06:21,958 --> 01:06:24,666
But no one can do anything to him...

726
01:06:40,291 --> 01:06:43,583
That's why I put the girl
in the truck with the seal

727
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:46,541
and made sure
that Devaratha stops that truck.

728
01:06:50,958 --> 01:06:52,875
The people who want to kill you...

729
01:06:53,041 --> 01:06:53,916
Your father...

730
01:06:54,083 --> 01:06:55,708
Him, his mother...

731
01:06:55,916 --> 01:06:56,750
Me...

732
01:06:56,916 --> 01:06:59,083
And the seal, all of us have
one thing in common...

733
01:07:00,166 --> 01:07:01,250
Khansaar.

734
01:07:06,291 --> 01:07:11,791
You know what happens if that
seal is stopped by anyone, don't you?

735
01:07:12,166 --> 01:07:16,333
You know whose seal that is!

736
01:07:22,333 --> 01:07:23,750
Someone has stopped the seal.

737
01:07:25,958 --> 01:07:27,041
For the first time ever...

738
01:07:28,166 --> 01:07:30,083
- And the one who stopped it is--
- I know.

739
01:07:37,125 --> 01:07:38,333
Varadha...

740
01:07:41,625 --> 01:07:44,083
Varadha Rajamannaar!

741
01:07:56,833 --> 01:07:59,875
No one other than him can stop it.

742
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Deva...

743
01:08:12,041 --> 01:08:14,083
Khansaar changed
the fate of a lot of people.

744
01:08:14,250 --> 01:08:15,875
But, what changed
the fate of Khansaar was

745
01:08:16,208 --> 01:08:17,833
when two best friends...

746
01:08:21,666 --> 01:08:23,833
became arch-rivals.

747
01:08:41,125 --> 01:08:43,291
My plan was amazing, wasn't it?

748
01:08:43,791 --> 01:08:47,291
Now a war will happen
between the two of them...

749
01:08:47,625 --> 01:08:49,833
And only one will survive.

750
01:08:54,250 --> 01:08:56,916
- Hey, Pilot...
- You said no one can stop that seal!

751
01:08:57,708 --> 01:08:59,625
The Salaar of Khansaar!

752
01:09:02,125 --> 01:09:04,000
No one can stop that seal.

753
01:09:04,166 --> 01:09:06,583
The Salaar to Varadha Rajamannaar.

754
01:09:10,041 --> 01:09:12,875
But he is the one who created that seal!

755
01:09:13,416 --> 01:09:17,708
Salaar Devaratha Raisaar!

756
01:09:44,416 --> 01:09:45,791
What happens now?

757
01:09:50,750 --> 01:09:52,666
It's the rule he defined.

758
01:09:54,250 --> 01:09:55,750
No one can break it!

759
01:09:56,083 --> 01:09:57,625
Up... Up...

760
01:09:59,833 --> 01:10:01,083
I am here for you.

761
01:10:01,833 --> 01:10:03,333
Whoever stops the seal must die.

762
01:10:10,708 --> 01:10:13,000
Some stories are frightening to watch.

763
01:10:17,666 --> 01:10:20,000
Some stories are frightening to listen to.

764
01:10:25,375 --> 01:10:26,625
But this story is...

765
01:10:27,666 --> 01:10:29,500
frightening to even think of.

766
01:10:45,708 --> 01:10:47,416
Do you want to listen to his story?

767
01:10:59,333 --> 01:11:01,291
This story began a thousand years ago.

768
01:11:02,625 --> 01:11:06,416
Dacoits more savage than Mahmud Ghazni
and Genghis Khan lived back then.

769
01:11:09,250 --> 01:11:11,833
They would not just loot a village...

770
01:11:12,875 --> 01:11:15,375
but, they would burn
down the village to ashes.

771
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:18,125
They would take everything
they looted, back to Khansaar.

772
01:11:20,083 --> 01:11:21,083
{\an8}Khansaar!

773
01:11:21,666 --> 01:11:23,958
{\an8}A forest situated between
mountains and the ocean.

774
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:26,625
{\an8}There were three tribes
among those dacoits.

775
01:11:27,916 --> 01:11:29,250
{\an8}The Mannaar tribe.

776
01:11:30,333 --> 01:11:31,583
{\an8}The Shouryaanga tribe.

777
01:11:33,541 --> 01:11:34,875
{\an8}And the Ghaniyaar tribe.

778
01:11:35,375 --> 01:11:39,125
The three tribes flourished and prospered
unchallenged for hundreds of years.

779
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:42,000
They turned the forest
into a formidable fortress.

780
01:11:44,416 --> 01:11:45,416
Fire!

781
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:47,791
The British who could
reign over the entire world

782
01:11:48,833 --> 01:11:51,291
could occupy the whole of India but...

783
01:11:52,250 --> 01:11:53,333
In Khansaar...

784
01:11:53,708 --> 01:11:55,083
they couldn't even set foot.

785
01:11:59,250 --> 01:12:03,166
Every time the British attempted to do
so, they ended up losing their own army.

786
01:12:09,791 --> 01:12:13,833
After Independence, the newly
formed nation had a huge issue...

787
01:12:14,166 --> 01:12:15,958
{\an8}What needs to be done with khansaar?

788
01:12:17,458 --> 01:12:20,291
The then leader of the three
tribes, Shivmannaar came to Delhi.

789
01:12:20,791 --> 01:12:23,208
Erasing Khansaar from the Indian map...

790
01:12:23,666 --> 01:12:27,041
He warned that the constitution of India
won't be applicable to Khansaar but...

791
01:12:27,333 --> 01:12:31,125
every rule set by Khansaar
will be applied to India.

792
01:12:33,750 --> 01:12:36,125
Money generated through all
the illegal activities in India

793
01:12:36,208 --> 01:12:38,708
like smuggling, gambling,
money laundering, drugs, land

794
01:12:38,833 --> 01:12:40,291
petroleum, fake currency

795
01:12:40,375 --> 01:12:44,041
and arms, used to run according
to the percentage fixed by Khansaar

796
01:12:44,333 --> 01:12:45,875
and were operated by their agents.

797
01:12:46,625 --> 01:12:48,833
To prevent the law and order
from interfering with their activity,

798
01:12:48,958 --> 01:12:50,916
they began to dictate politics.

799
01:12:52,208 --> 01:12:53,083
Fear

800
01:12:54,333 --> 01:12:56,250
With this weapon they had created

801
01:12:56,333 --> 01:12:57,916
no one dared to confront them.

802
01:13:02,333 --> 01:13:05,083
People feared to even say
the name "Khansaar".

803
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:09,666
They turned this business
which was run with fear

804
01:13:09,833 --> 01:13:11,958
as the only investment,
into a most profitable one.

805
01:13:13,166 --> 01:13:15,875
Fully aware of the violent nature
of the tribes, Shivmannaar...

806
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,875
decided to develop Khansaar into
a system as their earning grew infinitely.

807
01:13:22,208 --> 01:13:25,250
Drafting a set of rules to be
strictly adhered to by everyone,

808
01:13:25,625 --> 01:13:27,958
he named that book "Constitution".

809
01:13:28,916 --> 01:13:30,333
And according to that Constitution...

810
01:13:30,625 --> 01:13:32,583
he divided Khansaar into 101 parts

811
01:13:33,166 --> 01:13:35,208
and pointed leaders to those parts.

812
01:13:35,750 --> 01:13:38,416
He crafted a bracelet
as a symbol representing a leader.

813
01:13:39,041 --> 01:13:41,458
He then divided the leaders
into three major groups,

814
01:13:42,333 --> 01:13:45,250
61 Leaders with only one
vote each as "Governors".

815
01:13:45,375 --> 01:13:48,500
Eight leaders with at least
three votes each as "Lords".

816
01:13:52,083 --> 01:13:57,083
And with 15 votes for himself, Shivmannaar
announced himself as the King of Khansaar.

817
01:14:01,250 --> 01:14:02,958
One Day, Shivmannaar died...

818
01:14:06,916 --> 01:14:10,000
According to the agreement between the
three tribes, after Shivmannaar's death,

819
01:14:10,250 --> 01:14:14,041
the leader of the Shouryaanga
tribe, Dhaara had to rule Khansaar.

820
01:14:16,416 --> 01:14:20,375
But, Rajamannaar never wanted to give
away his father's throne to anyone else.

821
01:14:21,958 --> 01:14:23,791
Everyone is eying my throne?

822
01:14:25,333 --> 01:14:28,375
Not a single soul from
the Shouryaanga tribe should be spared.

823
01:14:28,791 --> 01:14:31,875
Can we confront them?

824
01:14:32,250 --> 01:14:35,208
There is only one way to kill them all.

825
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,250
Men, women, kith and kin...

826
01:14:40,333 --> 01:14:43,458
they must be killed while
they are asleep, spare no one.

827
01:14:46,083 --> 01:14:48,041
Even if just one life is spared...

828
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:50,541
the Shouryaangas' vengeance
is unimaginable.

829
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,583
Why?

830
01:15:25,083 --> 01:15:27,333
That day, the entire Shouryaanga
tribe was completely eliminated.

831
01:15:30,708 --> 01:15:33,916
For the massacre Rajamannaar
caused, everyone else bowed to him.

832
01:15:34,875 --> 01:15:36,958
He built the biggest
walls around Khansaar,

833
01:15:37,916 --> 01:15:39,625
assembled the largest armies,

834
01:15:40,541 --> 01:15:42,708
and made Khansaar
the most powerful place ever.

835
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,750
{\an8}Rajamannaar extended the 61 Governors...

836
01:15:55,541 --> 01:15:57,750
Out of the eight Lord positions,

837
01:15:57,833 --> 01:16:00,125
he appointed five of them
from the Ghaniyaar tribe.

838
01:16:02,416 --> 01:16:03,250
Vaali.

839
01:16:04,625 --> 01:16:05,583
Gurung.

840
01:16:06,458 --> 01:16:07,291
Cheeka.

841
01:16:09,375 --> 01:16:10,333
Ranga.

842
01:16:11,958 --> 01:16:12,791
And Naarang.

843
01:16:14,291 --> 01:16:17,208
He gave the rest of the three Lord
positions to his own family members

844
01:16:17,708 --> 01:16:20,708
Om, Rajamannaar's
first wife's elder brother.

845
01:16:21,916 --> 01:16:24,416
Bhaarava, Rajamannaar's son-in-law.

846
01:16:25,708 --> 01:16:28,166
Rudra, Rajamannaar's son
by his first wife.

847
01:16:30,250 --> 01:16:31,208
Radha Rama.

848
01:16:31,833 --> 01:16:33,916
Rajamannaar's daughter
by his first wife.

849
01:16:34,250 --> 01:16:37,000
Rajamannaar's honor and pride.

850
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:41,791
Though there were a lot of differences
between the Lords and the Governors...

851
01:16:42,291 --> 01:16:45,041
Nobody ever dared to go
against Rajamannaar's will.

852
01:16:47,666 --> 01:16:50,625
The people who were
violent-natured for over a 1,000 years

853
01:16:51,250 --> 01:16:53,041
had been suppressing
their nature for 25 years

854
01:16:53,666 --> 01:16:54,666
until, that day...

855
01:16:56,750 --> 01:16:58,416
Father, is it true?

856
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:00,208
Are you going out of Khansaar?

857
01:17:00,708 --> 01:17:02,500
I will go instead of you, if necessary.

858
01:17:02,958 --> 01:17:06,291
Temples are built to propagate religion.

859
01:17:10,458 --> 01:17:14,041
Kingdoms are ruled to propagate legacy.

860
01:17:15,041 --> 01:17:18,583
Khansaar is built
to propagate only one thing...

861
01:17:20,666 --> 01:17:21,583
Fear.

862
01:17:22,958 --> 01:17:25,041
I have maintained it until now.

863
01:17:25,583 --> 01:17:27,416
No one should cross that line of fear.

864
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,958
Who has crossed that line now?

865
01:17:30,875 --> 01:17:33,083
I am going out
of Khansaar to find that out.

866
01:17:33,958 --> 01:17:37,208
Rama, until I come back, I am
leaving Khansaar under your watch.

867
01:17:37,833 --> 01:17:41,000
And I have all the trust in you
that you will take care of it well.

868
01:17:42,083 --> 01:17:42,958
Okay, Father.

869
01:17:48,791 --> 01:17:49,625
My King.

870
01:17:50,291 --> 01:17:53,083
I know that nobody will
disobey your decisions.

871
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:56,916
But, as your son-in-law,
I would like to ask you something...

872
01:17:57,083 --> 01:17:58,958
When will you forgive him?

873
01:17:59,125 --> 01:18:02,000
- Who?
- Your son...

874
01:18:03,833 --> 01:18:04,708
Varadha.

875
01:18:05,041 --> 01:18:07,041
Why did you throw away the bracelet?

876
01:18:10,250 --> 01:18:11,583
Answer me, why?

877
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:17,625
He threw away the honor I gave him.

878
01:18:18,666 --> 01:18:20,958
He lost his right to be my son.

879
01:18:21,250 --> 01:18:22,708
But, he was just a ten-year-old.

880
01:18:22,958 --> 01:18:24,458
Why are you concerned about it?

881
01:18:26,458 --> 01:18:30,250
Because no one else has the
courage to stand before you and ask of it.

882
01:18:30,666 --> 01:18:35,791
Because, even now, you leave a chair
vacant for Varadha on your dining table.

883
01:18:37,083 --> 01:18:42,791
Whenever I see your father, Shivmannaar,
he reminds me of Varadha, because of that!

884
01:18:44,166 --> 01:18:46,166
He is also your blood, my King.

885
01:18:47,416 --> 01:18:51,333
He also deserves the honor
which Rudra gets.

886
01:18:53,916 --> 01:18:57,916
For the past 30 years,
I have been sitting on this throne

887
01:18:58,291 --> 01:19:02,916
and taking decisions only for Khansaar.

888
01:19:03,375 --> 01:19:08,541
For the first time,
I am making a decision for myself.

889
01:19:09,708 --> 01:19:13,625
All I want is one of your chairs.

890
01:19:16,958 --> 01:19:19,416
I believe you are the only
one who would give me...

891
01:19:19,541 --> 01:19:21,958
anything I ask for,
without thinking twice.

892
01:19:22,208 --> 01:19:24,041
Hence, I am asking you...

893
01:19:24,791 --> 01:19:26,125
Ranga!

894
01:19:29,916 --> 01:19:36,625
I wish to see my son, Varadha Rajamannaar,
as a Lord while I am still alive.

895
01:19:40,833 --> 01:19:41,666
Varadha...

896
01:19:41,750 --> 01:19:43,541
He is the son
of Rajamannaar's second wife.

897
01:19:44,083 --> 01:19:46,375
As he had sacrificed his bracelet
when he was a child,

898
01:19:46,708 --> 01:19:48,416
he couldn't become a Lord since then.

899
01:19:48,666 --> 01:19:50,208
Though he is designated as a Governor,

900
01:19:50,416 --> 01:19:52,708
he always lived with
the confidence of a Lord.

901
01:19:55,708 --> 01:19:57,583
Will you give it to me, Ranga?

902
01:20:02,041 --> 01:20:03,750
You shouldn't ask me, my King.

903
01:20:04,958 --> 01:20:06,291
You should only command me.

904
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:12,666
I am going out of Khansaar
on a very important errand.

905
01:20:13,041 --> 01:20:17,750
Once I come back, all the formalities
of making Varadha Rajamannaar a Lord

906
01:20:18,208 --> 01:20:19,833
should be done by you, Bali.

907
01:20:19,916 --> 01:20:20,750
Yes, my King!

908
01:20:51,083 --> 01:20:55,666
Do you know why he asked
for your chair out of all of us, Ranga?

909
01:20:57,041 --> 01:20:58,541
I am sure you know it.

910
01:21:04,208 --> 01:21:06,708
Your father picked up the bracelet
he threw on the ground

911
01:21:06,833 --> 01:21:11,083
and became a Lord, which doesn't
give him the same honor as winning...

912
01:21:11,250 --> 01:21:16,458
It felt as if a bone was thrown to
a pack of dogs and one dog got it...

913
01:21:16,541 --> 01:21:18,291
But my dad had genuinely won that day!

914
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:20,416
Had he asked for my life,
I would have willingly given it...

915
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:23,208
How can I give away my chair?

916
01:21:24,041 --> 01:21:25,083
Give it up.

917
01:21:26,916 --> 01:21:28,500
Will you give it up...

918
01:21:28,958 --> 01:21:29,958
Ranga?

919
01:21:30,291 --> 01:21:32,458
King Rajamannaar's orders...

920
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:34,791
cannot be defied.

921
01:21:35,541 --> 01:21:39,458
There is another order
more powerful than Rajamannaar's orders.

922
01:21:40,083 --> 01:21:41,625
Khansaar Constitution.

923
01:21:42,666 --> 01:21:45,708
And in that book, there
is a very important rule.

924
01:21:46,416 --> 01:21:48,291
"The strongest shall prevail...

925
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,375
The strongest shall...

926
01:21:51,458 --> 01:21:52,291
Rule."

927
01:21:53,083 --> 01:21:54,916
Ranga, yours is a new vengeance.

928
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:59,750
But Rudra's vengeance started
from the time Varadha was born.

929
01:22:00,791 --> 01:22:04,041
You might wonder why I'm showing so much
concern for you and what's in it for me.

930
01:22:04,208 --> 01:22:05,750
Today he has asked you to give away
your chair.

931
01:22:05,833 --> 01:22:07,083
Tomorrow it could be my turn...

932
01:22:07,375 --> 01:22:09,958
But that is not what
the Constitution says.

933
01:22:10,666 --> 01:22:13,250
I will defeat you.
And you defeat me.

934
01:22:14,666 --> 01:22:15,666
Let us fight.

935
01:22:16,916 --> 01:22:18,750
The strongest shall prevail.

936
01:22:19,916 --> 01:22:21,166
The strongest shall...

937
01:22:22,583 --> 01:22:23,750
Rule.

938
01:22:26,166 --> 01:22:28,166
Is Rudra off to kill Varadha?

939
01:22:28,458 --> 01:22:29,583
I can't believe this...

940
01:22:29,958 --> 01:22:33,208
Rudra has sent for Pandit.

941
01:22:33,291 --> 01:22:34,125
Pandit?

942
01:22:44,416 --> 01:22:46,083
When Rajamannaar returns...

943
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,666
Varadha will become a Lord.

944
01:22:49,625 --> 01:22:52,208
My Brother will become a Lord.

945
01:22:52,541 --> 01:22:54,958
But by the time Rajamannaar returns,

946
01:22:55,291 --> 01:22:57,000
what if Varadha is not alive?

947
01:23:07,791 --> 01:23:09,791
The strongest shall prevail.

948
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:15,125
The strongest shall rule!

949
01:23:46,333 --> 01:23:47,333
Ranga...

950
01:23:48,750 --> 01:23:50,583
You want to slit his throat...

951
01:23:51,083 --> 01:23:54,375
But I want the Mannaar
tribe pride he is wearing...

952
01:24:12,625 --> 01:24:14,291
The Constitution!

953
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,500
Rudra, it's the Constitution!

954
01:24:24,250 --> 01:24:25,500
No one should disobey it.

955
01:24:35,666 --> 01:24:37,208
Who was the one to stop me?

956
01:24:38,416 --> 01:24:40,125
Who stopped me?

957
01:24:41,166 --> 01:24:42,416
Hey!

958
01:24:48,041 --> 01:24:51,375
You are standing
in the court of our King Rajamannaar.

959
01:24:52,041 --> 01:24:54,333
In his presence or absence...

960
01:24:54,583 --> 01:24:57,375
no one should raise
their voice or run their mouth.

961
01:24:59,083 --> 01:25:00,583
It was me who stopped you.

962
01:25:01,041 --> 01:25:03,750
How can you to take that decision?

963
01:25:04,708 --> 01:25:09,208
Because I am representing the King now,
and that's why all of you are still alive.

964
01:25:09,541 --> 01:25:11,666
If the decision was mine,

965
01:25:12,625 --> 01:25:16,041
all of you would have been
beheaded by now.

966
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:18,041
Bali!

967
01:25:18,166 --> 01:25:19,208
Madam!

968
01:25:19,625 --> 01:25:23,583
From now on, I order
to stop any sort of violence

969
01:25:23,666 --> 01:25:27,750
between the Lords and
the Governors of Khansaar...

970
01:25:28,333 --> 01:25:30,583
I am imposing a ceasefire.

971
01:25:31,041 --> 01:25:32,875
On the orders of the acting King,

972
01:25:32,958 --> 01:25:37,166
a ceasefire is imposed
in Khansaar from today!

973
01:25:42,750 --> 01:25:43,958
The Constitution.

974
01:25:47,333 --> 01:25:51,375
All stand equal before
the Khansaar Constitution.

975
01:25:51,708 --> 01:25:58,375
The book gives the right to everyone
in Khansaar to defy even the King.

976
01:25:59,750 --> 01:26:02,125
I, Rudra Rajamannaar,

977
01:26:02,583 --> 01:26:08,208
in the rank of a Lord, propose
a voting to lift the imposed ceasefire!

978
01:26:17,166 --> 01:26:19,375
As per the Khansaar Constitution,

979
01:26:19,625 --> 01:26:22,083
after nine days,
the decision of whether the ceasefire

980
01:26:22,166 --> 01:26:25,208
should be imposed or not will be taken

981
01:26:25,291 --> 01:26:28,416
by the voting process that
will be held in Kotagada!

982
01:26:34,166 --> 01:26:36,500
{\an8}No one wanted to wait
until the voting day.

983
01:26:36,875 --> 01:26:39,333
{\an8}Right from the Lords to the Governors,

984
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:43,541
{\an8}everyone began to gather merciless
and immensely powerful armies.

985
01:27:06,166 --> 01:27:07,791
Rudra has called for Pandit...

986
01:27:07,875 --> 01:27:09,666
Naarang has assembled the Russians.

987
01:27:10,125 --> 01:27:12,208
Gurung has assembled the Serbians.

988
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:15,916
Even the Governors have
gathered at least fifty men each.

989
01:27:16,041 --> 01:27:18,333
Today, there were about
700 new entries at the gate...

990
01:27:18,541 --> 01:27:21,041
Not sure how many more armies
might enter Khansaar going forth...

991
01:27:28,208 --> 01:27:30,291
Do you know how intimidating
each one of them were?

992
01:27:34,875 --> 01:27:36,791
And the kind of weapons
they were carrying...

993
01:27:42,583 --> 01:27:43,666
You tell me.

994
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:46,666
How many are we bringing?

995
01:27:48,291 --> 01:27:49,291
Tell me.

996
01:27:50,666 --> 01:27:52,750
Which army are we going to bring?

997
01:27:56,250 --> 01:27:57,916
Brother, tell me please.

998
01:28:00,291 --> 01:28:02,083
Where is our army?

999
01:28:20,250 --> 01:28:22,333
We also set out to bring an army.

1000
01:28:35,875 --> 01:28:39,208
In just one jeep and
with only one vacant seat...

1001
01:28:43,750 --> 01:28:49,000
Even I was curious to see the army
that was supposed to fit in that seat.

1002
01:29:18,375 --> 01:29:19,583
Hey, Deva!

1003
01:29:19,791 --> 01:29:22,208
My dad has assigned me some work to do...

1004
01:29:22,375 --> 01:29:23,625
I can't come out with you...
You can leave.

1005
01:29:23,833 --> 01:29:25,791
- Hey...
- I said I can't come out...

1006
01:29:31,833 --> 01:29:32,750
Deva...

1007
01:29:35,833 --> 01:29:36,958
Do you remember me?

1008
01:29:40,708 --> 01:29:42,250
Your voice might have changed.

1009
01:29:43,541 --> 01:29:44,958
But the way you call me hasn't.

1010
01:29:48,083 --> 01:29:50,000
Other than my mother,

1011
01:29:50,166 --> 01:29:52,666
there is only one person
who calls me Deva in the entire world.

1012
01:29:55,666 --> 01:29:57,666
Varadha Rajamannaar.

1013
01:30:35,125 --> 01:30:36,291
How are you, mother?

1014
01:30:41,333 --> 01:30:42,333
I am starving...

1015
01:30:43,583 --> 01:30:45,000
Cook something for me.

1016
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:48,458
It's been so long since I ate your food.

1017
01:31:04,625 --> 01:31:05,541
Hey...

1018
01:31:09,541 --> 01:31:11,625
Why are you still here?
I told you I am not coming...

1019
01:31:14,041 --> 01:31:16,041
Hey... Where is your nose ring?

1020
01:31:20,750 --> 01:31:22,958
Would you...

1021
01:31:30,583 --> 01:31:31,750
Who took it?

1022
01:31:33,541 --> 01:31:35,250
I will tell my mother and come.

1023
01:31:36,875 --> 01:31:39,291
On one side, Varadha wanted
to take Deva with him at any cost...

1024
01:31:41,166 --> 01:31:43,500
On the other side, Deva's mother had
made up her mind not to send him along...

1025
01:31:58,041 --> 01:31:58,916
Mother!

1026
01:31:59,666 --> 01:32:01,625
- I think Varadha needs me...
- But...

1027
01:32:23,666 --> 01:32:24,625
Go with him...

1028
01:32:25,041 --> 01:32:25,875
Let's go get it.

1029
01:33:32,750 --> 01:33:34,750
- Sir...
- Need to make an entry.

1030
01:33:44,250 --> 01:33:46,708
- Rani... Rani...
- Surabhi!

1031
01:33:47,833 --> 01:33:49,333
- Rani!
- Surabhi!

1032
01:33:50,166 --> 01:33:51,458
Please, let go of her.

1033
01:33:51,625 --> 01:33:53,250
She will never come back again.

1034
01:33:54,916 --> 01:33:56,083
How many, sir?

1035
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:58,125
Only one.

1036
01:34:05,833 --> 01:34:07,583
Isn't there anyone else, sir?

1037
01:34:07,708 --> 01:34:09,041
I didn't call anyone else.

1038
01:34:16,583 --> 01:34:17,458
Surabhi!

1039
01:34:18,375 --> 01:34:19,416
What is your name?

1040
01:34:19,541 --> 01:34:20,458
Devaratha.

1041
01:34:20,541 --> 01:34:21,375
Which tribe?

1042
01:34:21,458 --> 01:34:22,750
He is an outsider.

1043
01:34:24,458 --> 01:34:25,541
Take his prints?

1044
01:34:25,916 --> 01:34:28,958
I am praying to our Goddess to save us.

1045
01:34:29,875 --> 01:34:34,833
Surabhi, no matter how much we pray,
no Gods step foot on this sinful land.

1046
01:34:35,041 --> 01:34:37,875
How many times should I tell you?

1047
01:34:50,208 --> 01:34:52,458
He got scared just by looking
at the wall.

1048
01:34:54,083 --> 01:34:55,375
Be careful, sir.

1049
01:34:55,875 --> 01:34:57,583
Whoever steps inside...

1050
01:34:58,083 --> 01:34:59,250
Never come out.

1051
01:35:05,291 --> 01:35:06,791
What are you doing now?

1052
01:35:12,541 --> 01:35:14,958
Huge walls are built out of fear.

1053
01:35:16,333 --> 01:35:17,875
Not out of fear of those going out...

1054
01:35:18,333 --> 01:35:20,125
You said Gods won't come for us.

1055
01:35:20,208 --> 01:35:21,958
So, I am praying in the opposite way.

1056
01:35:23,708 --> 01:35:25,583
...but out of fear of those coming in.

1057
01:35:28,916 --> 01:35:31,041
Hoping at least a demon
would come to our rescue.

1058
01:35:31,958 --> 01:35:35,791
After 25 years,
for the promise he made...

1059
01:35:36,125 --> 01:35:37,791
he came back
to the land where he was born.

1060
01:37:05,416 --> 01:37:06,916
- Baba, this is...
- I know.

1061
01:37:11,791 --> 01:37:14,750
Don't look around...
No one else will be coming...

1062
01:37:15,708 --> 01:37:16,708
Of course, I know.

1063
01:37:20,833 --> 01:37:23,083
Varadha has made an entry
in the register for his army at the gates.

1064
01:37:23,833 --> 01:37:26,875
Only one entry has been made at the gate.

1065
01:37:27,708 --> 01:37:29,083
Only one?

1066
01:37:34,500 --> 01:37:36,166
You brought only one man?

1067
01:37:36,458 --> 01:37:39,333
We needed a whole army,
and you brought just one?

1068
01:37:39,625 --> 01:37:41,458
- Him, of all people?
- I forgot to ask.

1069
01:37:41,833 --> 01:37:43,708
Did you make all the arrangements
for Deva's stay here?

1070
01:37:44,375 --> 01:37:45,458
Yes, I did.

1071
01:37:48,958 --> 01:37:50,166
Have you forgotten?

1072
01:37:51,083 --> 01:37:55,541
Because of that one decision
you made for him 25 years ago...

1073
01:37:57,333 --> 01:37:59,458
Our lives are so miserable even today.

1074
01:38:02,833 --> 01:38:04,291
And yet you have brought him back.

1075
01:38:04,541 --> 01:38:06,583
- Let him eat.
- You be quiet, Baba.

1076
01:38:08,833 --> 01:38:11,000
- Even now he could--
- Rinda!

1077
01:38:11,625 --> 01:38:14,208
Inform Satthi that the curry
is not spicy enough.

1078
01:38:14,375 --> 01:38:15,250
Deva won't like it.

1079
01:38:15,583 --> 01:38:18,000
When you serve him food, serve
a cup of raw chilly powder as a side.

1080
01:38:20,291 --> 01:38:25,500
Everyone in Khansaar desperately

1081
01:38:26,083 --> 01:38:29,625
wants to hack us to pieces...

1082
01:38:31,083 --> 01:38:32,583
Do you have any idea?

1083
01:38:43,583 --> 01:38:46,541
You didn't have to take
such a desperate decision now.

1084
01:38:47,083 --> 01:38:49,833
I want you to sit on my chair
while I am still alive

1085
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,708
and fulfill my wish
of seeing you as a Lord.

1086
01:38:51,791 --> 01:38:53,208
- But, Dad...
- Hey...

1087
01:38:53,708 --> 01:38:56,708
Until now, I have been fulfilling
your wishes without you asking for it...

1088
01:38:57,291 --> 01:38:59,250
Just fulfill this one wish of mine...

1089
01:39:01,666 --> 01:39:02,625
Lord!

1090
01:39:04,083 --> 01:39:06,666
Rudra Mannaar has sent you a message.

1091
01:39:06,833 --> 01:39:07,708
Lord Rudra sent a message?

1092
01:39:08,041 --> 01:39:10,083
I will do anything for him. What is it?

1093
01:39:10,666 --> 01:39:13,583
He asked you to make sure
that Varadha doesn't get any sleep.

1094
01:39:17,291 --> 01:39:19,250
Baba, we are going out.

1095
01:39:19,958 --> 01:39:21,166
Please call Deva as well...

1096
01:39:21,416 --> 01:39:23,166
There's so many of us. Why do we need him?

1097
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,000
Hey... Come.

1098
01:39:30,916 --> 01:39:31,916
Go, get him.

1099
01:39:32,500 --> 01:39:33,875
I will hit you...

1100
01:39:34,041 --> 01:39:35,083
Go!

1101
01:39:42,166 --> 01:39:43,000
Lord!

1102
01:39:43,833 --> 01:39:46,041
Why are you walking, my Lord?

1103
01:39:46,666 --> 01:39:48,166
Hey, hold an umbrella for him right now...

1104
01:39:49,666 --> 01:39:50,875
Where is the umbrella?

1105
01:39:59,166 --> 01:40:01,333
I know exactly what kind
of circumstances we are living in.

1106
01:40:02,291 --> 01:40:04,958
I also know we are surrounded
only by enemies all over...

1107
01:40:05,166 --> 01:40:06,083
Hey...

1108
01:40:09,583 --> 01:40:10,583
What is it?

1109
01:40:11,791 --> 01:40:13,958
More than the fear of getting killed,

1110
01:40:15,208 --> 01:40:18,500
I dread the humiliation
that we are yet to suffer...

1111
01:40:21,916 --> 01:40:22,833
Who is that?

1112
01:40:30,375 --> 01:40:34,375
All of them are desperately
waiting to chop your head off...

1113
01:40:34,750 --> 01:40:41,333
I feel like doing it right here,
right now, and then bury you.

1114
01:40:41,958 --> 01:40:43,833
If we want to stay alive here...

1115
01:40:44,208 --> 01:40:46,625
However large an army we get,
it won't be of any help.

1116
01:40:47,958 --> 01:40:51,166
In Khansaar, nothing can be
calculated by using a calculator.

1117
01:41:03,541 --> 01:41:07,000
That's why I brought a maniac
who can't be calculated.

1118
01:41:13,416 --> 01:41:14,791
But, what is he going to do?

1119
01:41:17,666 --> 01:41:18,791
Hold the gun tight.

1120
01:41:19,041 --> 01:41:21,291
You have to keep your body
upright while pulling the trigger.

1121
01:41:22,500 --> 01:41:23,541
Safety...

1122
01:41:24,250 --> 01:41:25,958
you can fire only if you
turn the safety switch off.

1123
01:41:26,625 --> 01:41:31,083
A mechanic would know how to use
a spanner and a wrench but...

1124
01:41:31,333 --> 01:41:33,250
how would he know how to use a gun?

1125
01:42:25,583 --> 01:42:26,708
That's it, right?

1126
01:42:41,166 --> 01:42:42,208
Let's go.

1127
01:42:44,791 --> 01:42:46,041
At your service, my Lord?

1128
01:42:47,041 --> 01:42:49,750
Hey, I don't see any vacant tables?

1129
01:42:50,666 --> 01:42:52,458
I will get the tables ready
for you at once, my Lord.

1130
01:42:55,375 --> 01:42:58,958
At times, I feel it's better
that he doesn't do anything.

1131
01:43:06,375 --> 01:43:09,625
How many times should I tell you
to fold your hands and stand!

1132
01:43:18,500 --> 01:43:19,500
Mother...

1133
01:43:25,875 --> 01:43:27,458
Where are you going?

1134
01:43:27,541 --> 01:43:29,166
We have some other work to do, let's go.

1135
01:43:29,708 --> 01:43:31,291
- No, actually...
- Come on, come...

1136
01:43:31,625 --> 01:43:32,458
Ganga...

1137
01:43:41,625 --> 01:43:43,791
Rudra on one hand and Ranga on the other.

1138
01:43:43,875 --> 01:43:46,875
Now, my son, Vishnu
as well is humiliating you...

1139
01:43:47,083 --> 01:43:49,583
Being Rajamannaar's son, it is extremely
painful for you to bear all that.

1140
01:43:49,791 --> 01:43:50,833
Do one thing.

1141
01:43:51,583 --> 01:43:54,166
Chop your head off
and place it at my feet.

1142
01:44:06,250 --> 01:44:07,333
It's my mistake...

1143
01:44:08,416 --> 01:44:09,500
I didn't notice...

1144
01:44:30,625 --> 01:44:32,166
How many more times
would you hold me back?

1145
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,208
How long can he hold himself back...

1146
01:44:39,166 --> 01:44:40,583
Even I don't know.

1147
01:44:52,666 --> 01:44:53,875
Hey, leave me...

1148
01:44:54,791 --> 01:44:58,041
Khansaar's King,
Rajamannaar's son...

1149
01:44:58,166 --> 01:44:59,791
Varadha Rajamannaar!

1150
01:45:00,250 --> 01:45:01,958
See his plight now!

1151
01:45:06,166 --> 01:45:08,333
I have absolutely no value here.

1152
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:10,083
- Baba...
- Hey!

1153
01:45:10,291 --> 01:45:13,708
- Hold on.
- Bilal... I will kill everyone...

1154
01:45:13,916 --> 01:45:16,791
Deva! Please sit down... please...

1155
01:45:19,333 --> 01:45:23,625
None of my people are happy
that I brought you here.

1156
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:29,916
They are just not saying it out loud...

1157
01:45:30,833 --> 01:45:32,250
But I'm sure they are cursing me.

1158
01:45:33,666 --> 01:45:37,666
You never bothered to even
ask me why I brought you here.

1159
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,208
- You won't ask me.
- Brother, you've had enough.

1160
01:45:43,333 --> 01:45:44,166
Let's go.

1161
01:45:45,250 --> 01:45:49,583
Hey... come here, my dearest brother...

1162
01:45:49,666 --> 01:45:53,125
Brother! Let me go, brother.

1163
01:45:55,375 --> 01:45:57,666
Hey, you guys bring him home.

1164
01:45:57,833 --> 01:45:58,791
Baachi!

1165
01:46:04,500 --> 01:46:06,375
I am really scared, my friend...

1166
01:46:09,750 --> 01:46:11,666
Not that something will happen to me.

1167
01:46:13,291 --> 01:46:16,875
Not that the little honor
I have left will be taken away...

1168
01:46:20,375 --> 01:46:24,958
I am only worried
about my younger brother.

1169
01:46:27,166 --> 01:46:29,416
You must make sure
nothing happens to him.

1170
01:46:31,791 --> 01:46:32,750
Hey...

1171
01:46:36,666 --> 01:46:38,083
You must look after him.

1172
01:46:40,041 --> 01:46:41,583
You must take care of him...

1173
01:46:47,083 --> 01:46:49,125
You must...

1174
01:46:51,625 --> 01:46:53,500
You only should take care of him.

1175
01:46:55,416 --> 01:46:56,375
Deva!

1176
01:47:07,500 --> 01:47:09,958
You have six hands and yet...

1177
01:47:10,375 --> 01:47:12,625
Not one is extended to help

1178
01:47:18,291 --> 01:47:20,875
We are in deep anguish

1179
01:47:21,041 --> 01:47:23,500
And you are nowhere to be seen

1180
01:47:29,333 --> 01:47:31,833
Why do you harbor anger

1181
01:47:31,958 --> 01:47:34,375
Against the fragile

1182
01:47:40,041 --> 01:47:42,875
To hail you with raised arms

1183
01:47:42,958 --> 01:47:45,583
There is no strength left

1184
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:56,291
Even with ceaseless worship,
We remain untouched by mercy

1185
01:47:56,416 --> 01:47:59,708
We called you again and again

1186
01:48:01,333 --> 01:48:04,041
Yet hope has faded away

1187
01:48:38,791 --> 01:48:43,000
{\an8}Along with Rudra, Ranga and Bhaarava,
another ten Governors have teamed up.

1188
01:48:44,208 --> 01:48:46,750
They will also try to influence
the others to take their side...

1189
01:48:47,208 --> 01:48:49,958
Rudra, no matter what you say,
we won't go against our King.

1190
01:48:50,166 --> 01:48:51,166
Good.

1191
01:48:51,708 --> 01:48:54,625
When I become the next King, I will
definitely tell everyone around me

1192
01:48:54,791 --> 01:48:58,291
that there lived a very
loyal man like you...

1193
01:48:59,416 --> 01:49:00,333
But, my Lord...

1194
01:49:00,750 --> 01:49:02,291
You cannot win without the Ghaniyaars.

1195
01:49:02,666 --> 01:49:04,666
And, none of the Ghaniyaars
will go against their leader, Naarang.

1196
01:49:04,791 --> 01:49:05,791
Naarang!

1197
01:49:06,083 --> 01:49:08,916
What if Ranga tries to influence
some of the Ghaniyaars to take his side?

1198
01:49:09,333 --> 01:49:11,625
Even if one of the leaders from
my tribe goes against our King,

1199
01:49:11,875 --> 01:49:14,250
I will kill all of them
with my own hands, my Lord.

1200
01:49:21,708 --> 01:49:24,000
- Children, Naarang.
- What?

1201
01:49:26,416 --> 01:49:27,708
Children.

1202
01:49:30,708 --> 01:49:31,625
Boy.

1203
01:49:36,166 --> 01:49:37,083
Girl.

1204
01:49:41,416 --> 01:49:43,458
Girl...

1205
01:49:50,916 --> 01:49:51,791
Hey, Pandit!

1206
01:49:51,916 --> 01:49:53,791
He is wearing the bracelet.

1207
01:49:54,333 --> 01:49:55,250
We can't touch him now...

1208
01:49:56,250 --> 01:49:58,416
Just be patient for four more days...

1209
01:50:03,625 --> 01:50:04,916
Girl...

1210
01:50:11,666 --> 01:50:13,250
I also have a wish.

1211
01:50:13,375 --> 01:50:14,625
What is it, Naarang?

1212
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,666
A wish of a Father,
unlike our King Rajamannaar's.

1213
01:50:21,833 --> 01:50:23,750
Oh, God! They are here again!

1214
01:50:24,708 --> 01:50:26,083
After the ceasefire voting...

1215
01:50:26,458 --> 01:50:28,916
I wish to see my son in my chair.

1216
01:50:32,041 --> 01:50:36,625
As soon as the ceasefire voting gets
over, your son will become a Lord, Uncle.

1217
01:50:45,958 --> 01:50:48,875
Brother, Vishnu is in Mahara.
He has ordered us to come.

1218
01:50:50,375 --> 01:50:51,500
This bloody...

1219
01:50:53,333 --> 01:50:54,375
- Hey!
- Sir?

1220
01:50:54,791 --> 01:50:57,750
Under no circumstances should
Deva know where we are going.

1221
01:51:00,458 --> 01:51:01,916
Even if he comes,
what is he going to do anyway?

1222
01:51:02,208 --> 01:51:03,916
Hey, tell him.

1223
01:51:04,041 --> 01:51:05,541
Hey, Deva shouldn't come there.

1224
01:51:06,541 --> 01:51:08,583
Hey, where is Devaratha?

1225
01:51:09,625 --> 01:51:11,375
How do I tell in a way
this idiot understands?

1226
01:51:13,875 --> 01:51:14,708
Where is he?

1227
01:51:15,958 --> 01:51:17,208
It's better if he doesn't understand.

1228
01:51:27,750 --> 01:51:29,875
Vishnu has a procedure.

1229
01:51:30,416 --> 01:51:32,500
First, he flies the kite high.

1230
01:51:40,708 --> 01:51:43,166
Hey, stop right there.

1231
01:51:46,041 --> 01:51:47,916
Then he cuts the string himself.

1232
01:52:20,666 --> 01:52:21,916
Whichever house

1233
01:52:22,541 --> 01:52:24,208
the kite lands on...

1234
01:52:28,125 --> 01:52:31,375
He takes one girl from that house.

1235
01:52:32,875 --> 01:52:34,041
Oh, God! No!

1236
01:52:34,583 --> 01:52:36,458
First get inside! Go inside!

1237
01:52:38,625 --> 01:52:39,583
Oh, no!

1238
01:52:43,791 --> 01:52:45,875
Oh, yeah... we got our chick.

1239
01:52:47,625 --> 01:52:50,041
- I'll go, Mother.
- Mother, please let me go.

1240
01:52:50,416 --> 01:52:52,875
You must take care
of our mother and little sister.

1241
01:52:52,958 --> 01:52:55,416
You are too young.
Just keep quiet.

1242
01:52:55,541 --> 01:52:56,791
I am going. That's it.

1243
01:52:56,958 --> 01:52:58,791
No one is stopping me. Swear on me.

1244
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:00,875
No, no. I will go.
Swear on me.

1245
01:53:01,041 --> 01:53:02,083
Oh, no!

1246
01:53:02,416 --> 01:53:04,708
It doesn't matter, it will hurt the same!

1247
01:53:04,916 --> 01:53:07,916
It doesn't matter who goes,
I'm a dead woman either way.

1248
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:12,541
O Goddess! Save us, please... please!

1249
01:53:15,666 --> 01:53:18,291
Oh, no! What do I do?

1250
01:53:29,166 --> 01:53:30,250
Surabhi!

1251
01:53:30,750 --> 01:53:32,958
I don't know which girl is
going to be mine today, but...

1252
01:53:33,541 --> 01:53:35,583
I cannot bear the suspense...

1253
01:53:37,208 --> 01:53:38,333
- Surabhi!
- Surabhi!

1254
01:53:38,916 --> 01:53:40,666
- Surabhi! What are you doing?
- Hey, Surabhi!

1255
01:53:40,916 --> 01:53:44,250
- Surabhi... Surabhi...
- Open the door! Open the door!

1256
01:54:28,500 --> 01:54:30,083
Hey, who called him here?

1257
01:54:32,041 --> 01:54:33,041
Hey!

1258
01:54:33,250 --> 01:54:34,541
Follow the procedure.

1259
01:54:34,666 --> 01:54:36,083
Stand with your hands folded.

1260
01:54:51,291 --> 01:54:52,875
Good.

1261
01:54:58,833 --> 01:55:02,625
Sir! Please spare her!

1262
01:55:03,291 --> 01:55:04,833
Sir! Please spare her!

1263
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:06,208
Sir, sir...

1264
01:55:09,083 --> 01:55:10,625
She is just a kid.

1265
01:55:17,125 --> 01:55:20,125
Where did you all go today,
leaving me behind?

1266
01:55:20,416 --> 01:55:22,166
That territory is called Mahara.

1267
01:55:23,708 --> 01:55:26,500
I beg you, my Lord.

1268
01:55:28,458 --> 01:55:29,916
It's like a poultry.

1269
01:55:31,625 --> 01:55:34,666
Vishnu chooses a hen every day

1270
01:55:36,250 --> 01:55:37,250
and kills it.

1271
01:55:39,375 --> 01:55:41,708
Please don't destroy her life.

1272
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:45,291
Let's take her home, my dear.

1273
01:55:45,375 --> 01:55:46,708
Hey, I don't have the patience.

1274
01:55:47,666 --> 01:55:49,291
Leave her alone.

1275
01:55:49,416 --> 01:55:50,958
Just give us two minutes, dear Lord.

1276
01:55:51,250 --> 01:55:53,125
I will get her ready like a lady.

1277
01:55:59,333 --> 01:56:01,791
- But, instead of the hens, it's...
- Baba.

1278
01:56:01,916 --> 01:56:04,833
We have other important things to do.
Let's go.

1279
01:56:20,833 --> 01:56:22,916
O Goddess Kateramma!

1280
01:57:12,916 --> 01:57:14,625
Your rituals are wrong.

1281
01:57:19,166 --> 01:57:21,166
If you want the Goddess
to listen to your prayers...

1282
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,041
Go to the animal market...

1283
01:57:31,500 --> 01:57:36,208
From the herd, select a nice and
healthy ram with strong twisted horns.

1284
01:57:39,916 --> 01:57:41,875
Hey, stop it!

1285
01:57:42,875 --> 01:57:43,875
Dear Lord!

1286
01:57:44,208 --> 01:57:46,791
Hold it by the horns and drag it down.

1287
01:57:47,666 --> 01:57:51,083
Garland it, apply turmeric
and vermilion on its face...

1288
01:57:51,250 --> 01:57:53,250
Then, sharpen the sword against a rock.

1289
01:57:53,875 --> 01:57:56,833
Hey, I am warning you!
I won't tell you again.

1290
01:57:57,291 --> 01:57:59,916
Water should be sprinkled on its face.

1291
01:58:00,916 --> 01:58:01,875
Mutthu!

1292
01:58:03,208 --> 01:58:05,916
As soon as it shakes its head...

1293
01:58:12,125 --> 01:58:13,750
Shall I go to the fair now?

1294
01:59:09,250 --> 01:59:10,416
Hey, go and kill him!

1295
01:59:36,375 --> 01:59:37,291
Hey!

1296
02:00:14,125 --> 02:00:15,791
Look at what he is doing, brother!

1297
02:00:16,583 --> 02:00:17,583
Kill him!

1298
02:00:40,875 --> 02:00:41,833
Hack him to death!

1299
02:00:58,500 --> 02:00:59,458
Surabhi!

1300
02:00:59,666 --> 02:01:01,250
Goddess Kateramma didn't come.

1301
02:01:01,958 --> 02:01:02,958
Instead...

1302
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:05,500
she has sent her son for us, Mother.

1303
02:02:35,458 --> 02:02:38,083
Brother, he will kill Vishnu.

1304
02:02:39,375 --> 02:02:42,166
If he dies, you know
what our plight will be, right?

1305
02:02:44,291 --> 02:02:45,958
Varadha! Stop him right now!

1306
02:02:50,625 --> 02:02:53,458
I have been watching him since childhood.

1307
02:02:55,583 --> 02:02:56,666
He won't stop.

1308
02:02:57,458 --> 02:02:59,166
Until that guy stops breathing...

1309
02:03:05,375 --> 02:03:06,375
He won't stop.

1310
02:03:25,708 --> 02:03:26,708
Are you going to hit me?

1311
02:03:27,041 --> 02:03:28,500
Do you know who my father is?

1312
02:03:32,291 --> 02:03:33,291
Baba!

1313
02:03:33,666 --> 02:03:35,041
Tell him to stop, Baba.

1314
02:03:38,958 --> 02:03:40,125
How dare you!

1315
02:03:41,875 --> 02:03:44,291
Kill that scoundrel

1316
02:04:15,666 --> 02:04:16,541
Just two minutes...

1317
02:04:17,666 --> 02:04:19,000
I will get him ready like a Lord.

1318
02:05:52,125 --> 02:05:55,708
I am just checking
if you are real or not, son.

1319
02:06:27,833 --> 02:06:29,125
Vishnu has been killed.

1320
02:06:36,625 --> 02:06:37,708
Was it him?

1321
02:06:48,333 --> 02:06:52,333
Why did Deva react so violently
for someone he didn't even know?

1322
02:06:52,708 --> 02:06:54,166
I don't understand it even today.

1323
02:06:55,625 --> 02:06:56,708
I understand!

1324
02:06:58,250 --> 02:07:00,458
In every girl who is in distress,

1325
02:07:01,791 --> 02:07:03,250
he sees his mother.

1326
02:07:08,833 --> 02:07:10,375
How dare he touch the girl!

1327
02:07:12,166 --> 02:07:13,458
A kid at that!

1328
02:07:20,166 --> 02:07:21,500
Sorry.

1329
02:07:26,791 --> 02:07:28,208
Whatever he did that day

1330
02:07:28,458 --> 02:07:29,333
affected not only us...

1331
02:07:29,833 --> 02:07:31,333
but the entire Khansaar.

1332
02:07:33,333 --> 02:07:34,500
This shouldn't be happening.

1333
02:07:34,625 --> 02:07:36,291
Especially during the ceasefire.

1334
02:07:36,583 --> 02:07:39,083
This is going to impact
the upcoming voting.

1335
02:07:39,708 --> 02:07:42,500
The ceasefire was enforced
so that Varadha wouldn’t get killed.

1336
02:07:42,708 --> 02:07:44,375
How could he go and do this?

1337
02:07:44,625 --> 02:07:45,708
It wasn't Varadha who killed him.

1338
02:07:46,166 --> 02:07:47,083
It was the new guy.

1339
02:07:51,208 --> 02:07:52,666
What do we do, Uncle?

1340
02:07:52,750 --> 02:07:55,583
For now, they have been
arrested by the Mannaars.

1341
02:07:55,833 --> 02:07:59,375
But we cannot take
any decision about this right now.

1342
02:08:00,500 --> 02:08:03,250
The decision will be made
by Naarang at Velamgadi.

1343
02:08:03,541 --> 02:08:06,291
He will surely not spare Varadha.

1344
02:08:06,416 --> 02:08:09,791
Rudra!

1345
02:08:11,208 --> 02:08:14,958
I heard you will hand over
Varadha to Naarang in Velamgadi.

1346
02:08:15,166 --> 02:08:19,208
Is he going to kill him? Is he?
But it's my prerogative to kill him.

1347
02:08:20,875 --> 02:08:23,000
Since it was the new guy
who flouted the rules,

1348
02:08:23,291 --> 02:08:27,708
you must convince Naarang
to punish the culprit.

1349
02:08:27,875 --> 02:08:30,958
If Varadha dies, I will be happy.

1350
02:08:31,500 --> 02:08:34,375
But I must follow my dad,
the King's command.

1351
02:08:35,083 --> 02:08:37,291
Uncle, I will speak to Naarang.

1352
02:08:37,541 --> 02:08:39,083
Please go to Varadha immediately.

1353
02:08:41,666 --> 02:08:42,625
Rudra...

1354
02:08:43,500 --> 02:08:48,208
I haven't asked you
for anything since childhood.

1355
02:08:48,875 --> 02:08:52,750
Do something, please.

1356
02:08:54,125 --> 02:08:56,375
I want Varadha.

1357
02:08:59,416 --> 02:09:01,291
Tomorrow at Velamgadi...

1358
02:09:01,625 --> 02:09:04,541
Naarang is going to pronounce the verdict.

1359
02:09:04,791 --> 02:09:07,166
All the arrangements have been made.

1360
02:09:08,041 --> 02:09:08,958
What does it mean?

1361
02:09:09,458 --> 02:09:11,875
If you want to save your skin,

1362
02:09:12,166 --> 02:09:13,791
don't open your mouth.

1363
02:09:15,958 --> 02:09:17,125
What does it mean?

1364
02:09:25,458 --> 02:09:31,333
My Lord...

1365
02:09:31,958 --> 02:09:34,875
This is not the right time to say this.

1366
02:09:35,291 --> 02:09:39,500
You have all the rights to do whatever
you want with the one who killed your son.

1367
02:09:39,958 --> 02:09:41,875
Varadha didn't kill your son.

1368
02:09:41,958 --> 02:09:44,875
The one who killed him is the new guy.

1369
02:09:45,125 --> 02:09:46,666
Remember that!

1370
02:09:48,125 --> 02:09:53,000
My Lord...

1371
02:09:53,958 --> 02:09:55,958
My Lord...

1372
02:09:59,833 --> 02:10:02,166
If we want to lift the ceasefire,

1373
02:10:02,291 --> 02:10:04,833
Naarang has to go against Rajamannaar

1374
02:10:07,625 --> 02:10:09,791
and kill Varadha.

1375
02:10:19,541 --> 02:10:23,166
It's true that Varadha
didn't kill your son.

1376
02:10:23,583 --> 02:10:24,500
But...

1377
02:10:24,791 --> 02:10:28,625
when your son was mercilessly
being hacked to death...

1378
02:10:30,375 --> 02:10:32,708
He stood there without doing anything.

1379
02:10:55,541 --> 02:10:57,958
The verdict at Velamgadi today

1380
02:10:58,208 --> 02:10:59,875
{\an8}has nothing to do with Kotagada.

1381
02:11:00,083 --> 02:11:02,416
{\an8}Don't move until further orders.

1382
02:11:02,541 --> 02:11:04,833
All of you remove the cartridges
from your guns and put them away.

1383
02:11:05,041 --> 02:11:07,875
Until I say, no weapons should be used.

1384
02:11:08,708 --> 02:11:11,583
Somebody's head will roll today.

1385
02:11:11,875 --> 02:11:13,958
As soon as it is done,
come and inform me.

1386
02:11:17,708 --> 02:11:19,500
I will take care of everything there.

1387
02:11:19,875 --> 02:11:21,333
But you must remain silent.

1388
02:11:23,083 --> 02:11:24,125
Understand?

1389
02:12:00,625 --> 02:12:02,875
This is the guy who knocked off Vishnu.

1390
02:12:04,791 --> 02:12:06,625
I believe he killed as many as 25.

1391
02:12:06,708 --> 02:12:07,541
Hmm.

1392
02:12:34,375 --> 02:12:39,291
Will it be his head or Varadha's today?

1393
02:13:11,208 --> 02:13:13,291
He has picked up a sword!

1394
02:13:39,375 --> 02:13:41,625
He is going towards Varadha, bro!

1395
02:13:49,416 --> 02:13:50,375
Hey!

1396
02:13:50,625 --> 02:13:53,416
He is going to kill your rooster.

1397
02:14:01,875 --> 02:14:02,833
Deva...

1398
02:14:03,875 --> 02:14:04,916
Deva!

1399
02:14:05,541 --> 02:14:06,833
It was me who killed your son.

1400
02:14:07,333 --> 02:14:09,500
Do whatever you want with me.
Don't touch Varadha, sir.

1401
02:14:11,250 --> 02:14:13,125
- Sir, Varadha is innocent, sir.
- Deva, stop.

1402
02:14:13,375 --> 02:14:14,458
I did it.

1403
02:14:14,833 --> 02:14:16,125
Don't touch Varadha, sir.

1404
02:14:23,250 --> 02:14:25,125
Sir, you can hit me or kill me.

1405
02:14:26,166 --> 02:14:27,750
But don't touch Varadha.

1406
02:14:31,083 --> 02:14:31,958
Deva!

1407
02:14:33,458 --> 02:14:34,750
Deva! Listen to me.

1408
02:14:35,125 --> 02:14:36,375
Stop right there.

1409
02:14:40,125 --> 02:14:40,958
Sir...

1410
02:14:41,958 --> 02:14:43,750
I killed Vishnu with these hands.

1411
02:14:46,291 --> 02:14:47,208
Hey...

1412
02:14:47,583 --> 02:14:48,625
Kill me.

1413
02:14:48,916 --> 02:14:50,291
What are you doing?

1414
02:14:50,541 --> 02:14:52,750
Please don't touch Varadha, sir.

1415
02:15:10,041 --> 02:15:11,708
Hey, bring him aside.

1416
02:15:13,916 --> 02:15:15,541
Hey, get back.

1417
02:15:21,708 --> 02:15:22,541
Sir...

1418
02:15:22,833 --> 02:15:23,916
He didn't do anything...

1419
02:15:24,208 --> 02:15:25,541
It's all because of me...

1420
02:15:28,416 --> 02:15:29,333
Kill me.

1421
02:16:09,125 --> 02:16:10,333
I told you...

1422
02:16:13,333 --> 02:16:15,250
I told you not to touch him!

1423
02:16:16,416 --> 02:16:18,125
Didn't I tell you not to touch him?

1424
02:16:19,916 --> 02:16:21,166
What are you looking at?

1425
02:16:21,541 --> 02:16:22,708
Shoot him down!

1426
02:16:22,791 --> 02:16:24,166
Load your guns!

1427
02:16:24,833 --> 02:16:26,375
No one touches him.

1428
02:16:29,500 --> 02:16:30,458
Please!

1429
02:16:34,208 --> 02:16:35,291
I...

1430
02:16:36,208 --> 02:16:37,250
Kindly...

1431
02:16:39,666 --> 02:16:41,041
Request!

1432
02:17:14,500 --> 02:17:15,791
Is it Varadha's head?

1433
02:17:17,500 --> 02:17:18,666
Or the new guy?

1434
02:17:19,250 --> 02:17:21,583
The new guy decapitated Naarang, Rudra.

1435
02:17:37,708 --> 02:17:39,875
You muted me in Khansaar.

1436
02:17:41,125 --> 02:17:45,166
But he decapitated
two people at high volume.

1437
02:17:45,375 --> 02:17:47,000
Maybe he doesn't know the rules...

1438
02:17:47,791 --> 02:17:49,958
Even if he knows them,
he doesn't follow them...

1439
02:17:59,291 --> 02:18:00,458
Of course it was.

1440
02:18:01,750 --> 02:18:03,583
Varadha said it correctly...

1441
02:18:03,875 --> 02:18:05,916
Seriously, he got himself a maniac.

1442
02:18:10,083 --> 02:18:13,291
Before Devaratha was brought
here, we were on a frying pan...

1443
02:18:14,291 --> 02:18:15,916
getting our lives fried
and burnt every day.

1444
02:18:18,083 --> 02:18:19,291
He killed the son...

1445
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:22,166
and threw us into the fire.

1446
02:18:23,041 --> 02:18:25,333
I thought at least our bones would remain.

1447
02:18:26,125 --> 02:18:27,041
But no.

1448
02:18:28,416 --> 02:18:30,041
Now he has killed the father as well.

1449
02:18:31,875 --> 02:18:35,291
What he will do next is...

1450
02:18:36,458 --> 02:18:37,375
suspense.

1451
02:18:38,500 --> 02:18:39,333
What?

1452
02:18:43,916 --> 02:18:46,625
Brother... brother... brother...

1453
02:18:47,458 --> 02:18:49,916
You gave him a pet name when he was young.

1454
02:18:50,500 --> 02:18:51,541
What was that?

1455
02:18:51,625 --> 02:18:53,791
I forgot! I forgot! I forgot!

1456
02:18:54,041 --> 02:18:55,375
Can you remind me?

1457
02:18:55,458 --> 02:18:59,500
You gave him a name with a lot of pride!

1458
02:18:59,666 --> 02:19:01,291
What was it? Tell me.

1459
02:19:01,583 --> 02:19:03,375
Tell me, brother. Tell me, tell me...

1460
02:19:03,458 --> 02:19:04,291
Tell me!

1461
02:19:08,916 --> 02:19:09,875
Hey!

1462
02:19:10,041 --> 02:19:12,458
Hey, brother! Hey, brother! Tell me!

1463
02:19:12,750 --> 02:19:14,458
- Hey...
- Hey, sit down!

1464
02:19:20,833 --> 02:19:22,416
I warned him not to touch you.

1465
02:19:23,416 --> 02:19:24,333
He paid no heed.

1466
02:19:25,458 --> 02:19:26,416
You heard me, right?

1467
02:19:28,666 --> 02:19:30,208
How could he touch you!

1468
02:19:31,833 --> 02:19:33,791
No one should touch you!

1469
02:19:48,375 --> 02:19:49,583
Sorry.

1470
02:19:55,083 --> 02:19:56,916
I should be saying sorry.

1471
02:19:58,000 --> 02:19:59,291
It was all my fault.

1472
02:20:04,500 --> 02:20:05,708
No matter what happens here,

1473
02:20:05,833 --> 02:20:08,916
I didn't want to involve you
and restrained myself several times.

1474
02:20:11,666 --> 02:20:12,958
But I couldn't anymore.

1475
02:20:13,750 --> 02:20:17,916
I knew this is how it would end
once you come here.

1476
02:20:19,750 --> 02:20:22,791
You would have done great
anywhere but here.

1477
02:20:26,750 --> 02:20:27,791
Sorry.

1478
02:20:50,500 --> 02:20:53,333
What could be more important
to dad than this?

1479
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:57,291
He doesn't answer my calls at all.

1480
02:20:58,041 --> 02:21:00,500
Uncle, did you hear anything
about the King?

1481
02:21:01,916 --> 02:21:04,916
If he doesn't turn up,
we will anyway lose.

1482
02:21:05,208 --> 02:21:07,083
There are 101 votes in total.

1483
02:21:07,333 --> 02:21:09,166
Since Naarang and Vishnu are dead,

1484
02:21:09,291 --> 02:21:11,875
they will invalidate their four votes.

1485
02:21:12,125 --> 02:21:13,625
97 votes remain.

1486
02:21:13,708 --> 02:21:18,000
With nine votes of Bhaarava,
Ranga and you, our votes would be 24.

1487
02:21:18,416 --> 02:21:21,083
We cannot trust the remaining voters.

1488
02:21:21,250 --> 02:21:24,000
Zorani, Acharya, Mishra,
Akram Pasha, Shukla...

1489
02:21:24,083 --> 02:21:25,250
I will bring them.

1490
02:21:26,041 --> 02:21:28,708
But you must hand over Varadha
to me after the voting.

1491
02:21:29,666 --> 02:21:31,416
What are you going to do with him?

1492
02:21:37,208 --> 02:21:40,875
What is our vote count
including all of them?

1493
02:21:41,875 --> 02:21:43,541
Including the King...

1494
02:21:43,625 --> 02:21:44,625
Forty eight.

1495
02:21:44,791 --> 02:21:46,541
Forty eight.

1496
02:21:53,750 --> 02:21:56,333
I will show you
what I am going to do with Varadha.

1497
02:21:56,458 --> 02:21:57,833
We have tried all combinations.

1498
02:21:57,916 --> 02:21:59,625
We have finally come
up with a new cocktail.

1499
02:21:59,791 --> 02:22:02,125
We also subjected them to intense torture.

1500
02:22:02,291 --> 02:22:04,000
The color red triggers them.

1501
02:22:04,166 --> 02:22:05,666
Hey, get up!

1502
02:22:15,666 --> 02:22:19,041
I am getting 100 more like them.

1503
02:22:28,791 --> 02:22:31,041
Let's assume that the King would be back.

1504
02:22:31,166 --> 02:22:34,875
We need Varadha's vote also.

1505
02:22:40,958 --> 02:22:44,041
{\an8}I came to know that you share
my father's blood when we were children.

1506
02:22:44,416 --> 02:22:46,500
I have despised you ever since.

1507
02:22:47,166 --> 02:22:48,833
But for this obstacle,

1508
02:22:49,541 --> 02:22:52,083
I would have shown you
my hatred right now.

1509
02:22:52,291 --> 02:22:55,125
King Rajamannaar won't turn up
for the voting tomorrow.

1510
02:22:55,375 --> 02:22:57,750
Everything will go as I expected.

1511
02:22:58,083 --> 02:23:01,041
Take this as an advice or a warning...

1512
02:23:01,500 --> 02:23:03,583
If you vote to lift the ceasefire...

1513
02:23:03,875 --> 02:23:05,125
I will kill you!

1514
02:23:06,208 --> 02:23:10,958
A man goes to any extent
for something he loves.

1515
02:23:11,416 --> 02:23:15,458
But for something he hates...
he goes even beyond that.

1516
02:23:15,833 --> 02:23:20,208
I hated you even before
my younger brother did.

1517
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:32,333
King Rajamannaar is coming
to Kotagada tomorrow.

1518
02:23:33,375 --> 02:23:37,750
If you vote for lifting the ceasefire
and disrespect him,

1519
02:23:38,083 --> 02:23:43,458
I will definitely divert all my hatred
towards the one you love the most.

1520
02:23:44,083 --> 02:23:45,166
Badri!

1521
02:23:45,541 --> 02:23:46,583
Madam!

1522
02:23:46,750 --> 02:23:48,875
If things don't go as I say tomorrow,

1523
02:23:49,083 --> 02:23:54,583
drag his brother out and behead him
once the voting is over.

1524
02:24:02,166 --> 02:24:05,208
If you have even an ounce
of Rajamannaar's blood in you,

1525
02:24:05,875 --> 02:24:07,708
you will make the right decision.

1526
02:24:25,500 --> 02:24:28,125
Bhaarava, I am very scared.

1527
02:24:28,250 --> 02:24:30,708
Do you think voting will go as we expect?

1528
02:24:32,833 --> 02:24:33,958
It has to.

1529
02:24:34,208 --> 02:24:35,416
And it will!

1530
02:24:36,666 --> 02:24:39,291
Finally, it's our time.

1531
02:24:56,166 --> 02:24:58,958
{\an8}Hear... hear... hear!

1532
02:24:59,291 --> 02:25:02,625
Following the discussion
on ceasefire nine days ago,

1533
02:25:02,708 --> 02:25:06,083
the voting process will be
held at Kotagada today.

1534
02:25:06,208 --> 02:25:11,083
To make a decision on this, first
the Governors, followed by the Lords,

1535
02:25:11,166 --> 02:25:15,083
and finally the King
shall use their voting right.

1536
02:25:15,291 --> 02:25:16,958
Those who want the ceasefire to end

1537
02:25:17,208 --> 02:25:20,708
{\an8}shall place their bracelets
with tickets on the left side.

1538
02:25:20,958 --> 02:25:23,083
{\an8}Those who want the ceasefire to continue

1539
02:25:23,250 --> 02:25:26,250
{\an8}shall place their bracelets with tickets
on the right side.

1540
02:25:28,541 --> 02:25:32,333
Though Varadha Rajamannaar is a Governor,
since he is an offender presently,

1541
02:25:32,458 --> 02:25:36,291
his right to vote shall not be
put to use unless it is a tie.

1542
02:25:40,166 --> 02:25:41,833
The voting shall begin now.

1543
02:25:41,958 --> 02:25:45,833
The voting should end
within the given time.

1544
02:25:46,250 --> 02:25:48,250
Governor 1!

1545
02:25:51,583 --> 02:25:53,125
Governor 10.

1546
02:25:53,416 --> 02:25:55,416
Governor 41.

1547
02:25:55,583 --> 02:25:58,291
Governor 6! Governor 13!

1548
02:25:58,416 --> 02:26:01,625
Governor 26.
Governor 16.

1549
02:26:01,750 --> 02:26:03,625
Governor 24.

1550
02:26:03,708 --> 02:26:04,958
Governor 17!

1551
02:26:05,083 --> 02:26:07,041
Governor 33!

1552
02:26:07,166 --> 02:26:08,625
Governor 21!

1553
02:26:08,708 --> 02:26:10,750
Governor 39!

1554
02:26:10,875 --> 02:26:12,291
Governor 55!

1555
02:26:12,416 --> 02:26:14,083
Governor 45!

1556
02:26:19,708 --> 02:26:21,333
No information on the King yet.

1557
02:26:21,500 --> 02:26:23,708
His flight arrival
is not scheduled at Khansaar.

1558
02:26:25,708 --> 02:26:27,416
Now the Lords will cast their votes.

1559
02:26:43,500 --> 02:26:45,708
Only the King's fifteen votes are left.

1560
02:26:45,833 --> 02:26:48,875
If he doesn't turn up
before the time runs out,

1561
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:51,708
only the bracelets already used
for voting will be counted

1562
02:26:51,791 --> 02:26:54,458
and the verdict on
ceasefire will be announced.

1563
02:27:15,666 --> 02:27:17,250
Shivmannaar's son!

1564
02:27:24,291 --> 02:27:30,041
Khansaar's King, Rajamannaar returns!

1565
02:27:51,916 --> 02:27:55,500
Since it's a tie
with 48 votes on each side,

1566
02:27:56,000 --> 02:28:00,333
the verdict shall be based
on Varadha Rajamannaar's vote.

1567
02:28:01,083 --> 02:28:03,791
Make your disgrace complete now.

1568
02:28:15,083 --> 02:28:18,166
Others' voting is not in our hands.

1569
02:28:19,291 --> 02:28:23,083
But your vote is in your hands.

1570
02:28:28,708 --> 02:28:30,958
It doesn't matter what they think.

1571
02:28:31,333 --> 02:28:34,625
What decision are you
going to make for yourself?

1572
02:28:35,541 --> 02:28:36,625
Spell it out.

1573
02:28:39,125 --> 02:28:42,000
It doesn't bother a hunter
if he can't find a prey.

1574
02:28:45,041 --> 02:28:48,916
But not being able to hunt would kill him.

1575
02:28:52,625 --> 02:28:54,083
Isn't it enough?

1576
02:28:59,541 --> 02:29:00,708
This is enough.

1577
02:29:03,708 --> 02:29:05,750
In that case,
declare the hunting season open!

1578
02:29:06,166 --> 02:29:09,583
I was waiting for you say it.

1579
02:29:11,333 --> 02:29:13,416
Khansaar must turn red!

1580
02:29:17,083 --> 02:29:19,000
Either with blazing fire...

1581
02:29:20,458 --> 02:29:22,333
or with their blood.

1582
02:29:25,958 --> 02:29:28,875
More than the redness of a raging fire,

1583
02:29:29,791 --> 02:29:33,291
the crimson color of flowing blood
is always beautiful.

1584
02:30:01,875 --> 02:30:02,875
Thank you.

1585
02:30:03,916 --> 02:30:05,166
With your advice,

1586
02:30:06,208 --> 02:30:07,916
I have taken the right decision.

1587
02:30:09,208 --> 02:30:11,208
I too have...

1588
02:30:14,166 --> 02:30:16,500
the Mannaar blood
flowing through my veins.

1589
02:30:20,208 --> 02:30:23,291
Tonight at 12:01 am,

1590
02:30:23,416 --> 02:30:28,166
based on the result of the votes,
the ceasefire has been lifted!

1591
02:30:39,833 --> 02:30:41,583
Now the rooster is yours.

1592
02:30:51,500 --> 02:30:53,083
They lifted the ceasefire?

1593
02:30:54,875 --> 02:30:56,500
Against them?

1594
02:30:57,791 --> 02:30:58,708
I mean how?

1595
02:30:59,041 --> 02:31:05,125
But the most important problem
was to survive the night.

1596
02:31:16,041 --> 02:31:19,625
Oh, are you saying that your people
are in trouble because of us?

1597
02:31:21,708 --> 02:31:24,500
Varadha has cast his vote
to lift the ceasefire.

1598
02:31:25,083 --> 02:31:26,291
Get everyone out.

1599
02:31:47,708 --> 02:31:49,458
Begin with his younger brother.

1600
02:31:53,083 --> 02:31:55,083
Sharpen the swords.

1601
02:31:59,208 --> 02:32:00,125
Come.

1602
02:32:09,541 --> 02:32:12,750
People only talk about hunting tigers.

1603
02:32:13,125 --> 02:32:15,291
It's very boring.
I don't like it.

1604
02:32:15,375 --> 02:32:18,791
More than tigers, I like to watch
how wild dogs hunt.

1605
02:32:18,875 --> 02:32:20,125
Do you know what a wild dog does?

1606
02:32:20,208 --> 02:32:23,166
It skins its prey and eats the flesh
while the prey is still alive.

1607
02:32:26,875 --> 02:32:29,583
I wanted to kill you myself.

1608
02:32:29,666 --> 02:32:31,791
But I have no capacity for such violence.

1609
02:32:31,958 --> 02:32:34,750
That's why I have raised
some wild dogs.

1610
02:32:35,291 --> 02:32:39,291
I gave them all kinds of drugs
and made them rabid.

1611
02:32:39,458 --> 02:32:44,833
When they tear at your body,
your blood will spout with a hiss

1612
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:47,250
and I would relish the sight!

1613
02:32:53,875 --> 02:32:56,333
Now, they have renewed hope to live.

1614
02:32:58,208 --> 02:32:59,875
After a long time...

1615
02:33:00,375 --> 02:33:02,041
they have started worshiping again.

1616
02:33:20,958 --> 02:33:21,958
Don't be scared.

1617
02:33:24,583 --> 02:33:25,708
Nothing will happen to them.

1618
02:33:52,833 --> 02:33:53,875
Hey.

1619
02:33:56,125 --> 02:33:58,833
You won't even be able to cut the skin
if you whet it like that.

1620
02:34:00,416 --> 02:34:02,666
Bend it and whet it.

1621
02:34:07,250 --> 02:34:08,916
It must cut through his bones!

1622
02:34:18,083 --> 02:34:20,583
You want me to give you a tattoo now?

1623
02:34:20,708 --> 02:34:24,375
All that I can see around you

1624
02:34:24,666 --> 02:34:28,708
is death, sir.

1625
02:34:31,583 --> 02:34:33,625
Do you see it too?

1626
02:34:52,166 --> 02:34:54,541
What do you want me to tattoo?

1627
02:35:00,416 --> 02:35:03,250
Whatever you see in my eyes.

1628
02:35:51,166 --> 02:35:53,333
It's done, sir.

1629
02:36:41,333 --> 02:36:43,125
Where are they all going?

1630
02:36:44,083 --> 02:36:46,625
They must have found
something redder, sir.

1631
02:36:56,333 --> 02:37:00,333
Have you ever seen
the hunters being hunted?

1632
02:37:02,500 --> 02:37:04,083
You will see it now.

1633
02:37:07,666 --> 02:37:10,083
Your grim reaper is here.

1634
02:37:11,875 --> 02:37:16,000
You gave them drugs and made them mad.

1635
02:37:28,583 --> 02:37:31,625
But he was born mad.

1636
02:37:45,208 --> 02:37:47,125
Release the remaining dogs!

1637
02:37:51,833 --> 02:37:53,541
Why are you so late?

1638
02:37:54,833 --> 02:37:56,875
The tattoo took some time.

1639
02:37:59,041 --> 02:38:01,625
You are tired with so few?

1640
02:38:01,958 --> 02:38:03,625
Hey, if I had a sword in my hand as well

1641
02:38:03,791 --> 02:38:06,625
I would have hacked them all by now.

1642
02:38:08,875 --> 02:38:10,833
Here, take the bigger one.

1643
02:38:31,583 --> 02:38:34,416
Why didn't you come
back here for 25 years?

1644
02:38:37,666 --> 02:38:42,458
Why haven't you called me
back here for 25 years?

1645
02:38:45,500 --> 02:38:46,791
I should have.

1646
02:39:04,958 --> 02:39:05,875
Hey...

1647
02:39:06,291 --> 02:39:07,750
Don't you know how to whistle?

1648
02:39:14,666 --> 02:39:17,125
Have you made friends there?

1649
02:39:17,791 --> 02:39:18,791
Many.

1650
02:39:19,583 --> 02:39:21,791
More good looking than you.

1651
02:39:24,541 --> 02:39:26,333
But they are girlfriends.

1652
02:39:27,333 --> 02:39:29,125
I have some too.

1653
02:40:17,166 --> 02:40:19,791
But I beat more people than you.

1654
02:40:21,083 --> 02:40:22,416
Move it!

1655
02:40:40,666 --> 02:40:44,708
This started when you declared
you wanted to make Varadha a Lord.

1656
02:40:45,916 --> 02:40:47,666
We are all violent men.

1657
02:41:00,791 --> 02:41:03,041
Violence is in our blood.

1658
02:41:14,791 --> 02:41:17,958
For 25 years, I kept the trait suppressed
which is 1,000 years old.

1659
02:41:18,583 --> 02:41:21,041
I have a childhood story.

1660
02:41:21,875 --> 02:41:23,833
This was bound to happen some day.

1661
02:41:24,458 --> 02:41:28,041
The ceasefire was only an excuse
to fight amongst themselves.

1662
02:41:28,500 --> 02:41:32,375
I would stand on the terrace
every day looking at the entire Khansaar

1663
02:41:32,916 --> 02:41:37,041
and dream that one day
all this would be mine.

1664
02:41:37,625 --> 02:41:42,208
Enough fighting for land and honor.

1665
02:41:44,666 --> 02:41:47,125
Whatever I can see...

1666
02:41:48,708 --> 02:41:50,166
I want it.

1667
02:41:50,958 --> 02:41:55,458
Everyone is after my chair.

1668
02:42:10,500 --> 02:42:12,375
That is exactly why they will join hands.

1669
02:42:13,666 --> 02:42:15,458
The first to join hands...

1670
02:42:16,166 --> 02:42:17,708
will be our own blood.

1671
02:42:34,166 --> 02:42:37,166
You thought I would kill you.

1672
02:42:37,625 --> 02:42:41,000
How can I kill my own blood, Uncle?

1673
02:42:41,833 --> 02:42:44,541
If you and I join hands

1674
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:50,666
the Mannaar emblem will be found
on every territory in Khansaar.

1675
02:42:51,958 --> 02:42:53,708
What do you say, Uncle?

1676
02:42:58,041 --> 02:43:02,083
What makes you think that uncle
and Rudra will join hands against you?

1677
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:05,500
Why do you think Rudra invited Pandit?

1678
02:43:06,208 --> 02:43:08,458
I know exactly what Pandit is capable of.

1679
02:43:09,833 --> 02:43:11,333
Secondly...

1680
02:43:11,833 --> 02:43:16,791
The reason for my trip out of Khansaar
was a huge weapons deal.

1681
02:43:16,875 --> 02:43:19,666
The order was placed from Khansaar.

1682
02:43:20,291 --> 02:43:21,166
Who?

1683
02:43:25,625 --> 02:43:26,666
Vaali.

1684
02:43:27,958 --> 02:43:30,541
{\an8}Do you know why Rajamannaar
obliterated an entire tribe

1685
02:43:30,708 --> 02:43:33,250
{\an8}but spared us, the Ghaniyaars?

1686
02:43:34,583 --> 02:43:36,333
Because we have no unity.

1687
02:43:38,333 --> 02:43:41,250
I won't sit around and wait until
what happened to them happens to us.

1688
02:43:47,875 --> 02:43:50,458
Khansaar is going
to break into pieces now.

1689
02:43:51,750 --> 02:43:53,625
If we stand united,

1690
02:43:55,333 --> 02:43:58,083
the whole of Khansaar will be ours.

1691
02:44:06,583 --> 02:44:07,541
Thiru...

1692
02:44:09,041 --> 02:44:10,291
Thirdly...

1693
02:44:11,958 --> 02:44:14,208
More terrible than the other two...

1694
02:44:14,708 --> 02:44:18,333
The sin I committed 25 years ago
has come back to hunt me down.

1695
02:44:19,500 --> 02:44:20,500
Tell me.

1696
02:44:21,500 --> 02:44:22,458
Where are they?

1697
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:26,500
Where is Bhaarava?

1698
02:44:27,875 --> 02:44:29,333
Bhaarava?

1699
02:44:31,916 --> 02:44:34,500
Your husband is not
a Mannaar as you believe.

1700
02:44:35,583 --> 02:44:36,416
Then?

1701
02:44:39,500 --> 02:44:42,791
Do you know why I built
such huge walls around Khansaar?

1702
02:44:42,958 --> 02:44:46,416
Do you know why I hold the deadliest
weapons and maintain a powerful army?

1703
02:44:48,250 --> 02:44:51,583
Because I always have this fear
that one of them could be alive.

1704
02:44:52,541 --> 02:44:53,625
Who?

1705
02:44:58,500 --> 02:44:59,708
The Shouryaangas.

1706
02:45:09,833 --> 02:45:11,833
Bhaarava is a Shouryaanga?

1707
02:45:27,958 --> 02:45:30,625
Our moms and dads were
falling victims there

1708
02:45:30,750 --> 02:45:33,416
and yet do you know how
carefully they hid us?

1709
02:45:53,208 --> 02:45:54,208
{\an8}Wait, wait, wait.

1710
02:45:54,416 --> 02:45:56,541
Wait, wait...

1711
02:45:57,208 --> 02:45:58,208
What?

1712
02:45:58,833 --> 02:46:01,958
The Shouryaanga army has been
lying in wait for the past 25 years,

1713
02:46:02,333 --> 02:46:05,958
all the while, causing internal conflicts
in Khansaar to weaken it.

1714
02:46:09,791 --> 02:46:12,416
We still feel the pain.

1715
02:46:16,708 --> 02:46:21,666
We have been living in hiding...

1716
02:46:21,875 --> 02:46:24,000
We have changed our names.

1717
02:46:24,250 --> 02:46:26,750
We have changed our identity.

1718
02:46:27,750 --> 02:46:29,708
All for this day...

1719
02:46:31,916 --> 02:46:33,375
When will you forgive him?

1720
02:46:33,458 --> 02:46:35,333
- Who?
- Your son.

1721
02:46:35,500 --> 02:46:38,250
If you don't eliminate
your enemy by tonight...

1722
02:46:38,375 --> 02:46:39,291
The Constitution.

1723
02:46:39,416 --> 02:46:43,250
Naarang must defy Rajamannaar.
He must kill Varadha.

1724
02:46:45,958 --> 02:46:50,875
You beheaded our deity!

1725
02:46:54,500 --> 02:46:59,250
To burn you alive along with your chair...

1726
02:46:59,375 --> 02:47:03,625
All the Shouryaangas
are eagerly waiting there.

1727
02:47:10,541 --> 02:47:13,250
Except one.

1728
02:47:19,791 --> 02:47:20,708
You...

1729
02:47:22,083 --> 02:47:24,500
remember Dhaara?

1730
02:47:26,750 --> 02:47:33,583
Our leader was supposed to sit
on the throne that day.

1731
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:37,666
But you killed him.

1732
02:47:40,375 --> 02:47:41,583
But...

1733
02:47:43,291 --> 02:47:47,208
His son is alive!

1734
02:47:51,250 --> 02:47:57,958
Your son, Varadha, rescued Dhaara's son
and sent him out of Khansaar that day.

1735
02:47:58,166 --> 02:48:00,333
You must leave immediately.

1736
02:48:00,708 --> 02:48:02,791
Why did you throw away your bracelet?

1737
02:48:03,041 --> 02:48:04,166
Why did you?

1738
02:48:06,041 --> 02:48:11,083
We have been looking
for him all these years...

1739
02:48:13,083 --> 02:48:15,458
But he has returned by himself.

1740
02:48:16,958 --> 02:48:19,375
Varadha has got his
army registered at the gate.

1741
02:48:20,166 --> 02:48:21,250
Only one?

1742
02:48:21,458 --> 02:48:28,000
You all saw what he has done ever
since he stepped into Khansaar, right?

1743
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:31,500
Vishnu was killed.

1744
02:48:31,750 --> 02:48:32,750
Was it him?

1745
02:48:35,708 --> 02:48:37,958
Our leader!

1746
02:48:55,708 --> 02:48:57,791
I will get our army ready, Father.

1747
02:48:59,250 --> 02:49:00,208
He is a...

1748
02:49:00,583 --> 02:49:01,833
Shouryaanga?

1749
02:49:02,125 --> 02:49:03,666
Wait, wait... wait...

1750
02:49:05,333 --> 02:49:07,416
I need a drink.
Do you have any alcohol?

1751
02:49:14,041 --> 02:49:16,458
Inform our Mannaar army
to stay on high alert

1752
02:49:16,541 --> 02:49:19,041
not just at the Khansaar gates,
but throughout the city!

1753
02:49:24,625 --> 02:49:25,458
Whoa!

1754
02:49:35,125 --> 02:49:39,416
On one hand, all of Khansaar
was ready to go to war for the throne.

1755
02:49:47,041 --> 02:49:52,000
On the other, thousands of Shouryaangas
were ready to burn the chair down.

1756
02:49:54,708 --> 02:49:58,458
But Deva had promised
the same throne to Varadha.

1757
02:50:03,583 --> 02:50:04,416
But...

1758
02:50:05,375 --> 02:50:08,750
The right to sit on that throne
belonged to...

1759
02:50:20,291 --> 02:50:21,375
Deva.

1760
02:50:31,916 --> 02:50:33,541
Does Deva know about this?

1761
02:50:43,416 --> 02:50:44,333
If he finds out?

1762
02:50:49,791 --> 02:50:52,708
No one should survive.

1763
02:51:05,458 --> 02:51:09,291
You asked me about the name
I gave him as a child...

1764
02:51:19,500 --> 02:51:20,708
Salaar.
