1
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:19,759
- There’s simply no way

2
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:22,395
to shield against every weaponized agent.

3
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,430
Instead, I can make super immune systems

4
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:26,366
by strengthening the human cellular response.

5
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,667
- Banner, I know where you’re going,

6
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,535
but manipulating the immune system

7
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:31,437
is dangerous and stupid.

8
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:35,375
The president’s science advisors made it absolutely clear.

9
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:38,344
No human subjects.

10
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,502
- David, I have wonderful news.

11
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:07,507
I’m gonna have a baby.

12
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,475
( straining )

13
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:16,549
Aah!

14
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:38,838
- ( cries )

15
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:49,242
- Oh, what’s this here? Oh, lookee there.

16
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:51,544
Bruce? Huh? Want the dinosaur?

17
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:52,879
Come on, let’s have a little fight.

18
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:56,549
Come on. Rrawr. You don’t scare me.

19
00:06:56,582 --> 00:07:00,052
Mmm, hey, delicious. Oh, you’re big and brave.

20
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,721
You’re scary. I’m gonna run away.

21
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,852
- ( gasps ) Bruce, you’re hurt!

22
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:35,588
- Jack hit him with the stick,

23
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,089
but Bruce wouldn’t hit him back.

24
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,625
He just stood there shaking.

25
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:50,837
- Kind of strange he didn’t make a peep.

26
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,139
Any other kid would have wailed his head off.

27
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:54,607
- That’s Bruce. He’s like that.

28
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,944
He’s just so bottled up.

29
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:03,649
- The samples we found in your lab,

30
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:04,951
they were human blood.

31
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,320
You’ve ignored protocol.

32
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:09,755
- You had no right snooping around in my lab.

33
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:10,890
That’s my business.

34
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:12,758
- Wrong, Banner!

35
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:15,761
It’s government business and you’re off the project.

36
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,151
- Attention, all personnel.

37
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,887
Fail-safe has been initiated.

38
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,789
Gamma decontamination will occur in 30 minutes.

39
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:45,057
Evacuate immediately.

40
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:47,760
I repeat, evacuate immediately.

41
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:50,730
( alarm sounds )

42
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,080
- Edith?

43
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:09,882
- David, what’s going on?

44
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,050
- I gotta talk to you, Edith.

45
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,718
- Bruce, stay here!

46
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,689
What are you doing?

47
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:37,610
- Rarrwr! Aah! Rarrwr! Grr!

48
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:42,148
( roaring )

49
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:54,727
( arguing )

50
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,730
- David, please stop! No!

51
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,899
David, no!

52
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,835
( arguing and shouting )

53
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:10,209
- ( screaming )

54
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,217
- Bruce. Bruce, wake up, son.

55
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,187
Bruce. Bruce.

56
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:27,159
Another nightmare?

57
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:29,128
- I don’t know.

58
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:31,097
I don’t remember.

59
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:34,934
Hi, Mom.

60
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,905
- Already off to college.

61
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:41,774
I’m gonna miss you terribly.

62
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,075
- I’ll miss you, too.

63
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:45,945
- Please come here.

64
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,949
Look at you.

65
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:53,052
Soon to be a great scientist.

66
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:55,488
- I guess. I mean, who knows?

67
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:59,058
- I do. There’s something inside you.

68
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:02,128
So special.

69
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,997
Some kind of greatness, I’m sure,

70
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:08,834
and someday you’re gonna share it with the whole world.

71
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:06,926
- As far as I’m concerned, security ought to be--

72
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,294
- Good morning, Dr. Krenzler.

73
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:10,863
- Security ought to be beefed up a lot more.

74
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,565
In a place like this, you can’t be too careful.

75
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:15,101
- Bruce? Big day.

76
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:16,569
Did you sleep? I didn’t sleep.

77
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:18,270
- I slept okay. Is Betty here?

78
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:20,139
- She’s around.

79
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:23,576
I really gotta say, seeing you in that styling headwear...

80
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:26,011
- You implying something about my helmet?

81
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:30,015
- You look like a massive nerd even around other scientists.

82
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:31,817
Can I just ask?

83
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:33,352
Were you wearing the helmet while she dumped you?

84
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:37,156
- See, it protects my very important brain, Harper.

85
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:38,791
Go prep the samples.

86
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:41,327
- Hey, I found you.

87
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,362
- Betty, hey.

88
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,033
- I hate them.

89
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:49,935
- Wait. I just got here. Who do we hate?

90
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:51,170
- The review board.

91
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:53,038
We have to make a presentation on Tuesday.

92
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:54,306
- Oh.

93
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,342
- And you’re gonna make it with me.

94
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,310
- You think I should?

95
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:00,246
- Yeah, you’re great with that stuff.

96
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:03,249
Start talking about microbes and nanomeds,

97
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:06,318
you sound almost passionate.

98
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:12,124
Sorry. That was rude.

99
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:14,059
- Look, nobody expects this to be easy,

100
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:19,064
us working together after being so close.

101
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:21,333
- We were close?

102
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:28,207
- Look, if I could be more whatever, you know, I just--

103
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,642
- Don’t.

104
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:32,645
It’s not your fault, really.

105
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:35,281
You’re just a by-product of my inexplicable obsession

106
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,283
with emotionally distant men.

107
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,185
I’ll get over us.

108
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:41,954
- Good for you.

109
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:44,223
- Anyway, I’m just really stressed about this review.

110
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:46,225
If we don’t get impressive results today,

111
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:49,361
we’re gonna have a really hard sell come Tuesday.

112
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:53,132
- Well, then let’s go be impressive.

113
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:38,510
Harper?

114
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,979
- Ready when you are.

115
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:41,347
- Let’s hit it.

116
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:48,087
We passing inspection?

117
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,958
- Safeties all going green. Countdown started.

118
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:59,398
- Nanomeds released.

119
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:01,233
- Four seconds.

120
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,374
- Okay. Nanomeds fully dispersed.

121
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,509
- Okay.

122
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:13,078
Let’s hit Freddie with the gamma radiation.

123
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:27,559
- Gamma exposure.

124
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:31,263
- Nanomeds now active.

125
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:39,071
- Nanomeds replicating cells on border.

126
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,073
- It’s working.

127
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:48,280
- Cell copy to disassemble ratio holding within 1%.

128
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:58,290
Imbalanced nanomed activity.

129
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:07,499
- ( sighs )

130
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:12,137
- You wanna go to the review board on Monday

131
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:13,372
and tell them we’ve developed

132
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:15,641
a brand-new method for exploding frogs?

133
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:18,544
- Yeah. I think maybe there’s a market for it.

134
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:22,047
I mean, what if there’s a plague?

135
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:24,583
- What have you had, Betty, like one beer?

136
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:27,353
- ( slurring ) I’m just saying, you know,

137
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:30,122
frogs start falling from the sky,

138
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,157
who do they come to?

139
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:34,526
We’d be world-renowned.

140
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,663
- Make any parent proud.

141
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:40,265
- I bet they would be.

142
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:44,136
- They actually did want me to be a scientist.

143
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,205
- I mean your birth parents.

144
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:49,441
- Guess we’ll never know.

145
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:51,410
- ( sighs )

146
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:55,547
I don’t understand why you don't wanna find out about them.

147
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:57,149
- They’re dead.

148
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,385
They died before I could remember anything.

149
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:02,187
Why do you always come back to this?

150
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:05,391
- Don’t know. Guess I figure

151
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:08,627
there’s more to you than you like to show.

152
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:12,431
I guess there couldn’t be any less.

153
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:15,401
- Right. So now we come full circle back to that.

154
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:17,202
Nice work, Betty.

155
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:32,084
- Betty?

156
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:35,587
- Glenn. - Hi.

157
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:37,389
- Hi.

158
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:38,690
- Hi.

159
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:43,328
- What happened to your uniform?

160
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:45,431
- Oh, I switched over.

161
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:47,132
I’m still working with your father,

162
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,334
but, well, you know, the military’s

163
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:51,637
subcontracting all the most interesting work.

164
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,272
( chuckles )

165
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:55,407
I can’t argue with the paycheck.

166
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:58,243
I basically run all the labs on the base now.

167
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:06,318
Hey, you’re looking good.

168
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:28,640
Ah, the good old college days.

169
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:33,212
So how’s business?

170
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:36,215
- What do you want?

171
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:38,217
- ( sighs )

172
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,651
All right, I’ll cut to the chase.

173
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:41,653
I’ve been hearing interesting things

174
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:43,555
about what you guys are doing here.

175
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:44,790
Your little molecular machines

176
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:47,659
have some incredible implications.

177
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:49,795
How’d you like to come work for Atheon?

178
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:52,798
Get paid 10 times as much as you are now

179
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:56,368
and own a piece of the patents.

180
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,272
You just have to say the word.

181
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:03,308
- Two words. The door.

182
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:23,428
- General?

183
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:25,197
- Come in.

184
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:28,500
- Talbot wanted you to see this, sir.

185
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:30,736
It’s about a lab Atheon is targeting

186
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:33,372
for acquisition and removal to Desert Base.

187
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:36,408
- Why isn’t he going through NSC?

188
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:42,347
- It concerns your daughter, sir.

189
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:56,295
- Hey, what happened to Benny?

190
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:58,297
Is he not working the night shift anymore?

191
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:02,734
- Benny’s dead. I’m the new guy.

192
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:05,737
- Oh.

193
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:08,507
Good to meet you. - Same.

194
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:33,765
( click )

195
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:36,501
- Let’s try another. - No, stay here.

196
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:39,871
I look tired anyway.

197
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,374
- Yeah, but you look great.

198
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:47,746
What’s the matter?

199
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:49,514
- It’s these dreams, Doctor.

200
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:52,784
I keep having them and they’re terrible.

201
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:56,588
- Tell me about your dream.

202
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:03,528
- Well, it starts with a memory.

203
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:04,730
I think it’s my first memory.

204
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:07,833
It’s this image I have

205
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:10,702
from when I was maybe two years old.

206
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:44,569
- Do you think it’s just a dream?

207
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:46,738
- No. I think it’s something that happened

208
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:51,143
when I was living out at Desert Base with my father.

209
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:54,780
Anyhow, the dream goes on

210
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:57,883
and suddenly I’m alone.

211
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:34,920
- That’s terrible.

212
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:36,655
You know I’d never hurt you.

213
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:41,860
- ( sighs )

214
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:15,594
- Hey there.

215
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:18,630
What’s your name, darling?

216
00:23:18,663 --> 00:23:21,666
Hmm? What’s your name?

217
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,001
( barks and growls )

218
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:25,904
Okay. It’s okay.

219
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:19,050
- I gotta talk to you, Edith.

220
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:20,719
- Bruce, stay there.

221
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:21,820
- Aah!

222
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:22,954
- ( gasps )

223
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:28,827
( dog whimpers )

224
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:47,973
- C, T, G, A, G.

225
00:26:49,874 --> 00:26:51,242
Bruce.

226
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,951
My Bruce.

227
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:12,130
- Morning. Glenn dropped by.

228
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:13,865
- What’s he doing here?

229
00:27:13,898 --> 00:27:16,001
- You know, Dr. Krenzler,

230
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:17,202
you and I have never had the chance

231
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:19,004
to get to know each other properly.

232
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:20,238
- Well, that’s because I don’t want

233
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:22,474
to get to know you properly or improperly.

234
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:24,275
( pager beeps )

235
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,911
So leave.

236
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:28,213
- Hey, no worries.

237
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:39,791
You know, let me give you a little heads up.

238
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:41,793
There is a hair’s breadth

239
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:44,996
between a friendly offer and a hostile takeover.

240
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,498
I’ve done my homework.

241
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:49,200
The work you’re doing here is dynamite.

242
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:52,137
Think. GIs embedded with technology

243
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,939
that makes them instantly repairable on the battlefield

244
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:57,008
in our sole possession.

245
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:59,811
That’s a hell of a business.

246
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,312
- Well, that’s not what we’re doing here.

247
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:04,716
We’re doing the basic science for everyone.

248
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:08,853
- You know, someday I’m gonna write a book,

249
00:28:08,887 --> 00:28:11,189
and I’m gonna call it "When Stupid Ideals

250
00:28:11,222 --> 00:28:15,093
Happen to Smart, Penniless Scientists."

251
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:17,996
In the meantime, Bruce, you will be hearing from me.

252
00:28:40,585 --> 00:28:42,987
- About Glenn, I, uh...

253
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:45,757
- There’s nothing to talk about.

254
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:49,294
- Okay.

255
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:51,863
I just wanted to say don’t worry about him.

256
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:53,765
I’ll handle it.

257
00:28:56,367 --> 00:28:58,236
- How?

258
00:28:58,269 --> 00:29:01,873
- I’m gonna call my father,

259
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:04,008
ask him to exert some pressure.

260
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:05,343
- The last I heard,

261
00:29:05,376 --> 00:29:08,012
you and your father weren’t speaking.

262
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:13,017
- Hmm. Well, I guess now I have something

263
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:15,286
to talk with him about.

264
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,122
- I think the circuit’s kind of fried.

265
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:20,158
I don’t know. Maybe you wanna come take a look at it.

266
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:22,327
- Okay, I’ll be right there.

267
00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:34,139
- Oh!

268
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:49,320
- The gamma’s too high!

269
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:51,422
Bruce, I can’t stop it!

270
00:29:54,325 --> 00:29:55,827
- Harper, get out!

271
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:59,931
- Get out!

272
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:27,425
- How’s Harper?

273
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:30,395
- He’s all right. You saved him.

274
00:30:30,428 --> 00:30:34,399
I don’t think he's coming back to the lab for a while, though.

275
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:42,473
I don’t understand how this is possible.

276
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:46,277
You should be dead.

277
00:30:48,246 --> 00:30:52,116
- They worked, the nanomeds.

278
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:55,320
I feel great. I feel like, I don’t know.

279
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:57,388
They must have, like, fixed me.

280
00:30:57,422 --> 00:30:59,023
- Bruce, they’ve killed everything else

281
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:00,959
that they’ve come into contact with.

282
00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:05,163
Are you sure the doctor checked--

283
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:07,065
- The doctor gave me the full workup.

284
00:31:07,098 --> 00:31:10,001
He wants to know where he can get what I’m taking.

285
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:15,106
I’m 100%. More.

286
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:17,342
- What do you mean?

287
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,010
- Remember my bad knee?

288
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:22,013
Well, now it’s my good knee.

289
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:25,216
- Bruce, this isn’t funny.

290
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,417
I was watching you.

291
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:28,987
You were gonna die,

292
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:32,156
and I was gonna have to watch you die.

293
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:38,029
- Hey, I’m sorry.

294
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:41,032
Really.

295
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:44,002
Hey, I’m not gonna explode, okay?

296
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:46,437
- Yeah. ( crying )

297
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:50,108
- You should get some rest.

298
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:53,077
I’m fine, really.

299
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:55,213
I’ve never felt better.

300
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:47,398
( dog whimpers )

301
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:00,545
- Your name is not Krenzler.

302
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:03,281
It’s Banner.

303
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:07,185
- What?

304
00:33:07,218 --> 00:33:09,620
- Your name. It’s Banner,

305
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:15,259
Bruce Banner. Bruce.

306
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:18,062
- How’d you get in here?

307
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:22,266
- I work here now in the labs, the late shift.

308
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:25,403
It keeps me close to you.

309
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:30,608
You always work so late yourself with your friend Ms. Ross.

310
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:34,045
No, no, no, please, please. Let me.

311
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:39,684
You’re not well.

312
00:33:39,717 --> 00:33:44,489
You’ve had a terrible accident.

313
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:47,592
You’re wondering why you’re still alive.

314
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:53,598
You’re thinking there’s something inside,

315
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:57,602
something different...

316
00:33:57,635 --> 00:34:01,172
inexplicable.

317
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:07,678
I can help you understand if you let me.

318
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:14,419
If you’ll...forgive me.

319
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:19,190
- Look, mister,

320
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:23,361
I’m sure I have nothing to forgive you for,

321
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:25,596
so perhaps you should leave now.

322
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,365
I’ll be fine.

323
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:29,600
- You must know.

324
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:31,602
You may not want to believe it,

325
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:35,673
but I can see it in your eyes.

326
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:39,377
So much like your mother’s.

327
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:43,314
Of course, you’re my flesh and blood.

328
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:47,418
But then you’re something else, too, aren’t you?

329
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:50,588
My physical son,

330
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:54,358
but the child of my mind, too.

331
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:57,462
- No. You’re lying.

332
00:34:57,495 --> 00:34:59,597
My parents died when I was a small boy.

333
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:02,166
- No, no, no, it’s not true, it’s not true.

334
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,701
That’s what they wanted you to believe.

335
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:07,338
The experiments, the accident, all top secret.

336
00:35:07,371 --> 00:35:10,374
They put me away for 30 years.

337
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:12,710
30 years.

338
00:35:12,743 --> 00:35:19,350
Away from you, away from our work.

339
00:35:19,383 --> 00:35:20,785
But they couldn’t keep me forever.

340
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:24,155
After all, I’m sane. They had to admit it.

341
00:35:25,556 --> 00:35:32,597
You see, everything your extraordinary mind

342
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:35,666
has been seeking all these years,

343
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,603
it’s been inside you.

344
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:41,506
Now you will understand it.

345
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:43,574
We will harness it.

346
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:46,244
( telephone rings )

347
00:35:46,277 --> 00:35:48,446
No, don’t answer. It’s Ms. Ross again.

348
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:51,315
There’s something you need to know about her, Bruce.

349
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:52,783
Something troublesome.

350
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:55,620
Let me protect you from her.

351
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:58,389
- No. Get out.

352
00:35:58,422 --> 00:36:00,625
- Bruce? - Get out!

353
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:03,628
( dogs snarl ) - Sit!

354
00:36:19,777 --> 00:36:23,414
We’re gonna have to watch that temper of yours.

355
00:36:48,606 --> 00:36:51,542
( dogs whimper )

356
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:56,547
( snarling )

357
00:37:03,087 --> 00:37:04,689
- You sure you’re okay?

358
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:06,857
- Yeah. Just glad to be out of bed.

359
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:10,695
- I got a message from my father.

360
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,630
He’s coming to see me.

361
00:37:12,663 --> 00:37:16,067
- Your father? When?

362
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,603
- Lands in about an hour.

363
00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:21,572
The funny thing is, he called me.

364
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:34,619
Hi, Dad.

365
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:36,520
- Hello, Betty.

366
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:47,632
- Oh, thanks.

367
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:49,533
- You’re welcome. Sir. - Thank you.

368
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:50,868
- You’re welcome.

369
00:37:59,577 --> 00:38:02,446
- Look, I’m gonna get right to it.

370
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,450
- It’s about Glenn, isn't it?

371
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:09,720
He’s been snooping around my lab.

372
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:10,955
- Glenn noticed some things.

373
00:38:10,988 --> 00:38:14,692
Asked me to make some inquiries.

374
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:19,597
- Are you here to question me?

375
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,899
- No.

376
00:38:21,932 --> 00:38:24,869
We’ve turned up some surprising things.

377
00:38:27,538 --> 00:38:32,443
This Krenzler you work with, you know who he really is?

378
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:36,480
How much do you actually know about him?

379
00:38:36,514 --> 00:38:38,849
- I think the question is

380
00:38:38,883 --> 00:38:42,353
what is it that you know about him?

381
00:38:44,555 --> 00:38:45,990
- Well, right now I’m not at liberty to--

382
00:38:46,023 --> 00:38:49,560
- Not at liberty to disclose it to me. Right, right.

383
00:38:49,593 --> 00:38:53,864
You know, I think I was hoping

384
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:56,867
that maybe this time

385
00:38:56,901 --> 00:39:01,972
you just honestly wanted to see me again.

386
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,708
- You’ve got this all wrong, Betty.

387
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:06,177
- Do I? - Yes.

388
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:08,679
I do want to see you.

389
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:13,984
- I really wish that I could believe you.

390
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:05,770
- Father: Everything your extraordinary mind

391
00:40:05,803 --> 00:40:09,774
has been seeking all these years,

392
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:10,975
it’s been inside you.

393
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:19,450
( telephone rings )

394
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,922
( ring )

395
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:30,661
( ring )

396
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:33,264
- Answering machine: Hi. You’ve called Dr. Krenzler.

397
00:40:33,297 --> 00:40:36,500
Please leave a message and I’ll call you right back.

398
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:37,701
( beep )

399
00:40:37,735 --> 00:40:41,572
- Betty: Bruce, hey. Are you there?

400
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:43,874
Look, I think I screwed-up.

401
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:47,678
My father, it’s like he suspects you of something.

402
00:40:47,711 --> 00:40:51,015
I don’t know. I was so impatient like always

403
00:40:51,048 --> 00:40:52,950
and I didn’t hear him out.

404
00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:54,819
I don’t know.

405
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:57,721
I just think that they’re planning something with the lab.

406
00:40:57,755 --> 00:41:01,892
So call me, okay?

407
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:03,828
Bye.

408
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:05,095
( hangs up )

409
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:07,498
- Betty?

410
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:13,070
( growls )

411
00:41:13,103 --> 00:41:17,041
( grunts )

412
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:44,869
Aah!

413
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:07,091
Aah!

414
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:45,162
- Dispatch! Dispatch!

415
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:46,830
We have a 415 at the lab.

416
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:49,600
Send the Berkeley PD now. Send ’em now.

417
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:01,178
( siren )

418
00:44:23,861 --> 00:44:25,062
- Edith?

419
00:44:25,095 --> 00:44:27,131
- David, what’s going on?

420
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:29,900
- I gotta talk to you, Edith.

421
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:36,507
- ( growls )

422
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:38,242
- Oh!

423
00:44:44,882 --> 00:44:47,951
( roars )

424
00:44:58,228 --> 00:45:00,130
- Bruce.

425
00:45:03,133 --> 00:45:05,335
My Bruce.

426
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:08,305
( crying )

427
00:45:11,141 --> 00:45:12,776
( knock on door )

428
00:45:15,312 --> 00:45:17,047
( knock knock knock )

429
00:45:19,416 --> 00:45:21,218
- Bruce?

430
00:45:57,988 --> 00:46:00,324
There was some sort of explosion.

431
00:46:00,357 --> 00:46:02,326
They wouldn’t let us into the building.

432
00:46:04,361 --> 00:46:06,997
I was worried about you.

433
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:09,199
- Well, I’m okay.

434
00:46:11,168 --> 00:46:14,404
- What happened to you last night?

435
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:19,309
- I had the most vivid dream.

436
00:46:19,343 --> 00:46:23,113
I was like being born, coming up for air.

437
00:46:23,147 --> 00:46:27,117
Light hitting my face, screaming.

438
00:46:27,151 --> 00:46:33,190
My heart beat like boom...

439
00:46:33,223 --> 00:46:37,294
boom...

440
00:46:37,327 --> 00:46:39,263
boom.

441
00:46:44,668 --> 00:46:47,304
- Were you at the lab?

442
00:46:47,337 --> 00:46:51,175
- No, but something...

443
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:56,346
But there was that man,

444
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:58,448
the one with the dogs.

445
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:00,350
- Who?

446
00:47:00,384 --> 00:47:04,221
- That new janitor.

447
00:47:04,254 --> 00:47:06,990
He said he was my father.

448
00:47:08,959 --> 00:47:10,394
( pounding on door )

449
00:47:12,462 --> 00:47:14,164
- I’ll get it.

450
00:47:35,152 --> 00:47:37,921
- My, my.

451
00:47:37,955 --> 00:47:40,290
So this is the young Bruce Bann--

452
00:47:42,492 --> 00:47:45,195
Krenzler.

453
00:47:45,229 --> 00:47:49,366
I think you left something in your lab last night.

454
00:47:53,303 --> 00:47:56,173
Mitchell, escort my daughter outside.

455
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:58,075
I’ll join her shortly.

456
00:47:58,108 --> 00:48:01,011
- I’d rather stay here.

457
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:03,347
- Now, Betty.

458
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,516
- It’s okay.

459
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:10,220
I’ll be fine.

460
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:22,032
- Keep him under observation. I’ll be back.

461
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:31,108
- What?

462
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:33,377
- Your friend in there, there’s a good chance

463
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:36,446
he’s caught up in some very bad business,

464
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,282
unfinished business.

465
00:48:38,315 --> 00:48:41,485
I promise you, I’m gonna get to the bottom of it.

466
00:48:41,518 --> 00:48:44,588
You have my word, I’ll make sure he’s cared for.

467
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:47,291
But as of right now, he’s incommunicado.

468
00:48:47,324 --> 00:48:50,294
For the next few days at least,

469
00:48:50,327 --> 00:48:52,162
you’re gonna stay away from here

470
00:48:52,195 --> 00:48:54,131
for your own good.

471
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:06,009
- Okay, and that’s for the new guy on the night shift, right?

472
00:49:06,043 --> 00:49:08,979
Great. Thank you. I appreciate it.

473
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:28,598
- Dr. Ross.

474
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:32,235
I wasn’t expecting you,

475
00:49:32,269 --> 00:49:34,204
but come in.

476
00:49:38,675 --> 00:49:42,446
- I’m sorry to just show up at your house like this.

477
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:45,015
- Aw.

478
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:50,320
- I came to ask you something

479
00:49:50,354 --> 00:49:54,257
that I really have no business asking.

480
00:49:54,291 --> 00:49:58,128
- He told you.

481
00:49:58,161 --> 00:50:02,065
- He said you talked to him.

482
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:03,467
- Sit down.

483
00:50:11,575 --> 00:50:14,511
- Bruce was at the lab last night.

484
00:50:14,544 --> 00:50:16,413
He said that you were there, too.

485
00:50:16,446 --> 00:50:19,516
He can’t remember much about it.

486
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:21,485
I need to find out what happened.

487
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:26,323
- So you wanna know what’s wrong with him

488
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:28,558
so you can fix him.

489
00:50:28,592 --> 00:50:32,362
Cure him. Change him.

490
00:50:32,396 --> 00:50:35,265
- My father’s with the military.

491
00:50:35,298 --> 00:50:37,234
He seems to think he’s involved

492
00:50:37,267 --> 00:50:39,369
in some kind of threat to national security.

493
00:50:39,403 --> 00:50:44,374
- Mm-hmm, your father... Ross.

494
00:50:44,408 --> 00:50:49,246
You brought your father down upon his head.

495
00:50:49,279 --> 00:50:52,249
How little you understand, Ms. Ross,

496
00:50:52,282 --> 00:50:56,219
and how dangerous your ignorance has become.

497
00:50:57,487 --> 00:50:58,655
- I’m sorry?

498
00:50:58,688 --> 00:51:00,323
- Don’t be sorry.

499
00:51:00,357 --> 00:51:04,594
My son is...unique.

500
00:51:04,628 --> 00:51:07,564
That’s why you can’t relate to him.

501
00:51:07,597 --> 00:51:10,133
And because he is unique,

502
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:14,404
the world will not tolerate his existence, will they?

503
00:51:14,438 --> 00:51:18,675
But you...

504
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:22,345
You try, don’t you?

505
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:33,590
And a very beautiful woman like you,

506
00:51:33,623 --> 00:51:36,293
your attentions

507
00:51:36,326 --> 00:51:42,632
can’t be completely unwanted, can they?

508
00:51:42,666 --> 00:51:49,706
No, not with eyes like yours

509
00:51:49,739 --> 00:51:55,278
watching expectantly, lovingly.

510
00:51:57,981 --> 00:52:01,184
But I’m afraid we're both too late to help him.

511
00:52:01,218 --> 00:52:06,189
There’s nothing I can do for him or for you.

512
00:52:06,223 --> 00:52:10,193
Besides, he’s made it clear

513
00:52:10,227 --> 00:52:11,695
he wants nothing to do with me.

514
00:52:11,728 --> 00:52:13,763
His choice.

515
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:15,532
Now if you’ll excuse me, Ms. Ross,

516
00:52:15,565 --> 00:52:17,968
I have some work to do.

517
00:52:18,001 --> 00:52:20,804
And don’t worry about the dogs.

518
00:52:20,837 --> 00:52:22,472
You’ll be fine.

519
00:52:22,506 --> 00:52:25,575
Just don’t look 'em in the eyes.

520
00:52:28,278 --> 00:52:29,446
Goodbye.

521
00:52:32,282 --> 00:52:33,517
- Ross: He gets released

522
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:35,285
and a month later your lab is destroyed.

523
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:36,786
What a coincidence.

524
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:39,523
So you’re just not gonna tell me where he is, are you?

525
00:52:39,556 --> 00:52:41,324
- How many times do I have to tell you?

526
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:43,560
I’d like to help you, but I just don’t know.

527
00:52:43,593 --> 00:52:45,495
- You know who I am, right, Banner?

528
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:47,731
- You’re Betty's father. You’re a high-ranking general.

529
00:52:47,764 --> 00:52:49,432
- Let’s cut the crap.

530
00:52:49,466 --> 00:52:51,301
I’m the guy who had your father tossed away

531
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:52,802
and a lot more like him,

532
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:55,338
and I’ll do the same with you if I feel so disposed.

533
00:52:55,372 --> 00:52:56,540
You understand?

534
00:52:56,573 --> 00:52:58,308
- If you had him tossed away,

535
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:00,744
then why are you asking me? I don’t remember.

536
00:53:00,777 --> 00:53:03,446
I was always told my father was dead.

537
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:04,748
- Don’t play with me!

538
00:53:04,781 --> 00:53:07,817
You were four years old when you saw it.

539
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:09,786
- When I saw what?

540
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:11,388
- You were right there.

541
00:53:11,421 --> 00:53:14,457
How could anyone forget a thing like that?

542
00:53:14,491 --> 00:53:17,527
- What?

543
00:53:17,561 --> 00:53:20,497
- Oh, some more repressed memories.

544
00:53:23,567 --> 00:53:26,603
- Just tell me.

545
00:53:26,636 --> 00:53:30,774
- I’m sorry, son.

546
00:53:30,807 --> 00:53:35,545
You’re an even more screwed up mess than I thought you’d be.

547
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:37,814
Until we get to the bottom of this,

548
00:53:37,847 --> 00:53:41,651
your lab has been declared a top secret military site.

549
00:53:41,685 --> 00:53:43,353
And you’re not gonna get a security clearance

550
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:44,888
to get back into it

551
00:53:44,921 --> 00:53:47,624
or any other lab that’s doing anything more interesting

552
00:53:47,657 --> 00:53:49,326
than trying to figure out

553
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:52,295
the next generation of herbal hair gel.

554
00:53:55,532 --> 00:53:57,367
One more thing.

555
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:03,540
If you ever come within 1,000 yards of my daughter again,

556
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:07,811
I’ll put you away for the rest of your natural life.

557
00:54:19,889 --> 00:54:21,825
( dogs snarling )

558
00:54:21,858 --> 00:54:23,093
- Dogs.

559
00:54:23,126 --> 00:54:25,528
( barking )

560
00:54:25,562 --> 00:54:28,765
Go! Go get her!

561
00:54:28,798 --> 00:54:31,801
And let nothing stand in your way!

562
00:55:18,448 --> 00:55:20,450
( cell phone rings )

563
00:55:24,421 --> 00:55:25,889
( ring )

564
00:55:29,859 --> 00:55:31,494
( ring )

565
00:55:35,432 --> 00:55:36,933
( ring )

566
00:55:38,768 --> 00:55:39,803
- Hello?

567
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:41,705
- Father: Bruce?

568
00:55:41,738 --> 00:55:44,607
So they think they can just throw you away

569
00:55:44,641 --> 00:55:46,509
as they did me.

570
00:55:54,818 --> 00:55:55,952
- What’s wrong with me?

571
00:55:55,985 --> 00:55:57,620
What did you do to me?

572
00:55:57,654 --> 00:56:01,658
- I got a visit today, a very unwelcome visit.

573
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:04,627
I’m afraid my hand is being forced.

574
00:56:04,661 --> 00:56:07,664
- What did you do to me?

575
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:10,834
- You so much want to know, don’t you?

576
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:12,969
But I think no explanation

577
00:56:13,002 --> 00:56:17,640
will serve you half as well as experience.

578
00:56:17,674 --> 00:56:21,978
In any case, I still don’t quite understand it myself.

579
00:56:22,011 --> 00:56:25,548
If they’d only let me work in peace.

580
00:56:25,582 --> 00:56:28,485
Of course, my betters would have none of that.

581
00:56:28,518 --> 00:56:31,821
- So you experimented on yourself, didn’t you?

582
00:56:31,855 --> 00:56:35,492
And passed on to me what?

583
00:56:35,525 --> 00:56:39,696
- An alteration, genetic, a deformity.

584
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:41,698
I guess you could call it that,

585
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:44,868
but an amazing strength, too.

586
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:48,938
And now finally unleashed, I can harvest it.

587
00:56:48,972 --> 00:56:51,841
- No. You’ll do no such thing.

588
00:56:51,875 --> 00:56:54,244
I will isolate it and treat it myself.

589
00:56:54,277 --> 00:56:55,812
I’ll remove it and I’ll kill it

590
00:56:55,845 --> 00:56:57,680
before it does any real harm.

591
00:56:57,714 --> 00:57:00,683
- Well, I bet you and your Betty would love to destroy it,

592
00:57:00,717 --> 00:57:04,687
but would you really destroy part of yourself?

593
00:57:04,721 --> 00:57:07,690
I don’t think so.

594
00:57:07,724 --> 00:57:11,928
And as for Betty, I’m sending her a surprise visit

595
00:57:11,961 --> 00:57:14,597
from some four-legged friends of mine.

596
00:57:14,631 --> 00:57:16,599
You see, I managed to culture

597
00:57:16,633 --> 00:57:18,701
some of your very own DNA, Bruce,

598
00:57:18,735 --> 00:57:21,504
and the results are tremendous.

599
00:57:21,538 --> 00:57:24,941
They’re unstable, but very powerful.

600
00:57:26,843 --> 00:57:29,612
- What about my DNA?

601
00:57:29,646 --> 00:57:31,714
- Let’s just wait and see

602
00:57:31,748 --> 00:57:33,716
what Betty makes of the results.

603
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:37,687
- No, you’re crazy. I won’t let you.

604
00:57:40,657 --> 00:57:42,959
- Get your hands off of me.

605
00:57:42,992 --> 00:57:45,128
- Inside, asshole. - I wanna talk to you.

606
00:57:45,161 --> 00:57:47,864
Listen to me. My father’s going after Betty.

607
00:57:47,897 --> 00:57:49,833
- What makes you think you can go behind my back

608
00:57:49,866 --> 00:57:50,967
and get Ross to cut me out, huh?

609
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,569
- Oh!

610
00:57:52,602 --> 00:57:54,637
Listen to me. Betty’s in trouble.

611
00:57:57,907 --> 00:57:59,876
- You pathetic freak. - Betty’s in trouble.

612
00:57:59,909 --> 00:58:01,678
I swear to you she’ll be killed.

613
00:58:01,711 --> 00:58:04,647
- If I can state the obvious, something tells me

614
00:58:04,681 --> 00:58:05,882
you aren’t in much of a position

615
00:58:05,915 --> 00:58:07,884
to be making stupid threats to anyone.

616
00:58:12,622 --> 00:58:14,691
- Talbot. - Yeah?

617
00:58:14,724 --> 00:58:16,826
- You’re making me angry.

618
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:19,062
- Oh, am I?

619
00:58:34,944 --> 00:58:37,780
- ( growls )

620
00:58:49,626 --> 00:58:51,928
( snarls )

621
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:11,581
( roars )

622
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:17,120
- Lay down fire! Open fire!

623
00:59:37,006 --> 00:59:39,842
( car alarm beeps )

624
00:59:54,691 --> 00:59:55,959
( crash )

625
01:00:40,737 --> 01:00:42,005
- ( gasps )

626
01:01:50,273 --> 01:01:52,008
( twigs snap )

627
01:01:54,143 --> 01:01:57,113
( dogs snarling )

628
01:01:58,347 --> 01:02:01,250
( growling and barking )

629
01:02:10,827 --> 01:02:12,295
- ( growls )

630
01:03:20,897 --> 01:03:21,831
Aah!

631
01:03:37,446 --> 01:03:38,381
Huh?

632
01:03:40,449 --> 01:03:42,084
Oh!

633
01:03:53,963 --> 01:03:56,032
( roars )

634
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:39,495
He sent his dogs, didn’t he?

635
01:06:39,528 --> 01:06:41,597
But I killed them.

636
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:45,601
( grunts )

637
01:06:45,634 --> 01:06:47,403
- Aah!

638
01:07:07,223 --> 01:07:10,159
Oh, God, it must be the nanomeds.

639
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:11,594
It must be the gamma explosion,

640
01:07:11,627 --> 01:07:14,530
but we’ve never seen any effect like this before.

641
01:07:14,563 --> 01:07:17,266
- No, deeper.

642
01:07:17,299 --> 01:07:20,669
The gamma just unleashed what was already there.

643
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:23,439
- Unleashed what?

644
01:07:23,472 --> 01:07:26,308
- Me.

645
01:07:26,342 --> 01:07:28,077
It.

646
01:07:30,346 --> 01:07:32,114
- It’s okay.

647
01:07:32,148 --> 01:07:33,549
It’s okay.

648
01:07:33,582 --> 01:07:38,187
What were those animals?

649
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:40,456
- My father sent them.

650
01:07:40,489 --> 01:07:44,193
He is my father.

651
01:07:44,226 --> 01:07:45,661
He wanted me to change.

652
01:07:45,694 --> 01:07:49,331
He wanted me to change into that mindless hulk.

653
01:07:49,365 --> 01:07:51,667
Why would he want that?

654
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:54,737
- Can you remember anything?

655
01:07:54,770 --> 01:07:58,641
Is there anything from when you were changed?

656
01:08:01,243 --> 01:08:04,513
- It was like a dream.

657
01:08:04,547 --> 01:08:07,516
- About what?

658
01:08:07,550 --> 01:08:12,221
- Rage...

659
01:08:12,254 --> 01:08:15,224
power...

660
01:08:15,257 --> 01:08:18,394
and freedom.

661
01:08:35,211 --> 01:08:36,946
( cell phone rings )

662
01:08:36,979 --> 01:08:40,516
- Hello? Sir.

663
01:08:40,549 --> 01:08:42,418
- Hello? - Dad.

664
01:08:42,451 --> 01:08:45,421
- Betty, are you all right?

665
01:08:47,423 --> 01:08:49,325
- I’m scared.

666
01:08:49,358 --> 01:08:50,793
I need your help.

667
01:08:50,826 --> 01:08:52,561
- Where are you?

668
01:09:03,339 --> 01:09:05,207
- How are you?

669
01:09:05,241 --> 01:09:08,577
- Okay, I guess.

670
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:14,283
- I think that somehow

671
01:09:14,316 --> 01:09:18,320
your anger is triggering the nanomeds.

672
01:09:18,354 --> 01:09:20,256
- How could it?

673
01:09:20,289 --> 01:09:22,658
We designed them to respond to physical damage.

674
01:09:22,691 --> 01:09:25,761
- Emotional damage can manifest physically.

675
01:09:25,794 --> 01:09:29,431
- Like what?

676
01:09:32,401 --> 01:09:35,704
- Serious trauma.

677
01:09:35,738 --> 01:09:38,574
Repressed memories.

678
01:09:43,479 --> 01:09:46,348
- Your father grilled me about something

679
01:09:46,382 --> 01:09:48,717
that happened to me from early childhood.

680
01:09:48,751 --> 01:09:51,353
I’m supposed to remember.

681
01:09:51,387 --> 01:09:52,454
- He did?

682
01:09:52,488 --> 01:09:53,856
- It sounded bad,

683
01:09:53,889 --> 01:09:59,328
but I honestly don’t remember.

684
01:09:59,361 --> 01:10:02,631
- The thing that worries me

685
01:10:02,665 --> 01:10:07,803
is a physical wound is finite,

686
01:10:07,836 --> 01:10:10,372
but with emotions, what’s to say

687
01:10:10,406 --> 01:10:12,708
that it won’t just go on and on

688
01:10:12,741 --> 01:10:15,778
and start a chain reaction?

689
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:22,651
- You know what scares me the most?

690
01:10:22,685 --> 01:10:26,622
Is that when it happens,

691
01:10:26,655 --> 01:10:33,562
when it comes over me and I totally lose control...

692
01:10:33,596 --> 01:10:36,398
I like it.

693
01:10:49,678 --> 01:10:50,713
( gasps )

694
01:10:53,349 --> 01:10:54,516
- It’s all right. I got you.

695
01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:56,418
I’m sorry.

696
01:10:56,452 --> 01:10:59,755
You’ll be okay. It’s just to make you sleep.

697
01:10:59,788 --> 01:11:01,857
- Target down. - Target secure.

698
01:11:01,890 --> 01:11:05,661
- I’m going to take you someplace safe, okay?

699
01:11:05,694 --> 01:11:07,896
Bruce?

700
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:09,898
Bruce?

701
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:11,700
Bruce?

702
01:13:58,033 --> 01:14:00,602
- Attention on deck. - Carry on.

703
01:14:09,545 --> 01:14:11,947
- We’re buried out here in the middle of nowhere.

704
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:14,516
How long are you gonna keep him sedated?

705
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:16,618
- For the rest of his natural life if I have to.

706
01:14:16,652 --> 01:14:17,986
- You said I could trust you.

707
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:19,888
- I’m your father.

708
01:14:19,922 --> 01:14:22,591
You can trust me to do what I think is right,

709
01:14:22,624 --> 01:14:24,526
not what you think you want.

710
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:26,094
- He is a human being.

711
01:14:26,128 --> 01:14:28,130
- Well, he is also something else.

712
01:14:28,163 --> 01:14:29,932
Suppose he gets out,

713
01:14:29,965 --> 01:14:33,001
has one of his little mood swings in a populated area?

714
01:14:33,035 --> 01:14:35,304
- Yes, I’m aware of the potential danger.

715
01:14:35,337 --> 01:14:37,906
I’m also aware that he saved my life.

716
01:14:37,940 --> 01:14:40,742
- Yeah, from a mutant French poodle.

717
01:14:40,776 --> 01:14:43,712
I’m indebted to him for that.

718
01:14:43,745 --> 01:14:45,881
He also put three men in a hospital,

719
01:14:45,914 --> 01:14:47,049
and Talbot’s barely walking.

720
01:14:47,082 --> 01:14:48,083
I mean, what do you want me to do?

721
01:14:48,116 --> 01:14:51,687
- I want you to help him.

722
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:53,155
Why is he such a threat to you?

723
01:14:53,188 --> 01:14:55,157
- Because I know what he comes from.

724
01:14:55,190 --> 01:14:59,795
He is his father’s son, every last molecule of him.

725
01:14:59,828 --> 01:15:01,763
He says he doesn’t know his father,

726
01:15:01,797 --> 01:15:05,634
but he’s working in the same exact goddamned field

727
01:15:05,667 --> 01:15:07,569
his father did.

728
01:15:07,603 --> 01:15:09,771
So either he’s lying

729
01:15:09,805 --> 01:15:11,807
or it’s something worse and he’s...

730
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:13,609
- What?

731
01:15:13,642 --> 01:15:18,113
Predestined to follow in his father’s footsteps?

732
01:15:18,146 --> 01:15:22,684
- I was gonna say damned.

733
01:15:22,718 --> 01:15:24,653
- Of course you were.

734
01:15:24,686 --> 01:15:26,021
But I’m a scientist.

735
01:15:26,054 --> 01:15:29,658
As a scientist, I believe we can figure this out

736
01:15:29,691 --> 01:15:31,126
and he can be helped.

737
01:15:31,159 --> 01:15:34,062
- I know you do.

738
01:15:34,096 --> 01:15:38,033
But whether you know or care,

739
01:15:38,066 --> 01:15:41,870
I’ve got a lot of pride in what you’ve done.

740
01:15:41,904 --> 01:15:44,072
But this is too big for you.

741
01:15:44,106 --> 01:15:47,175
- Look, I know the government

742
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:48,911
thinks they have a weapon on their hands.

743
01:15:48,944 --> 01:15:50,812
Otherwise, he’d be dead by now.

744
01:15:50,846 --> 01:15:53,682
They can probe and prod all they want.

745
01:15:53,715 --> 01:15:55,918
In the meanwhile, just let me try to help him.

746
01:15:55,951 --> 01:15:57,920
Nobody knows him better than I do.

747
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:05,594
What did David Banner do to him?

748
01:16:08,864 --> 01:16:11,033
- Cover left. - Cover left.

749
01:16:11,066 --> 01:16:12,134
- Cover right!

750
01:17:00,482 --> 01:17:01,984
- Aah!

751
01:17:52,834 --> 01:17:56,705
( squeaking and clanking )

752
01:18:23,365 --> 01:18:26,334
- What’s happening here?

753
01:18:26,368 --> 01:18:28,103
- My hand.

754
01:18:30,138 --> 01:18:35,143
You see the strength of my son’s DNA

755
01:18:35,177 --> 01:18:39,748
combined with nanomed reconstruction?

756
01:18:42,017 --> 01:18:45,053
You see, I can partake with the essences of all things.

757
01:18:47,155 --> 01:18:53,028
- I’ll have to ask you to put your hands up, pal, okay?

758
01:18:53,061 --> 01:18:55,163
Nice and easy.

759
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,235
- ( laughs )

760
01:19:00,268 --> 01:19:03,972
Do you really believe

761
01:19:04,005 --> 01:19:06,408
that I am separate from you?

762
01:19:06,441 --> 01:19:08,777
( laughs )

763
01:19:25,227 --> 01:19:27,095
- Where am I?

764
01:19:31,266 --> 01:19:33,068
- You’re home.

765
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:47,949
It’s hard to believe we used to live here.

766
01:19:50,652 --> 01:19:53,955
- I must have seen you or known you.

767
01:19:53,989 --> 01:19:56,124
If only I could remember.

768
01:20:30,692 --> 01:20:33,094
This is my old house, isn’t it?

769
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:14,970
Let’s go.

770
01:21:15,003 --> 01:21:17,439
- Please try.

771
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:14,329
What is it?

772
01:22:14,362 --> 01:22:16,998
- Nothing.

773
01:22:17,032 --> 01:22:18,333
- Really?

774
01:22:21,269 --> 01:22:23,972
- Damn it.

775
01:22:28,243 --> 01:22:32,514
Okay, Betty, what do you want to know?

776
01:22:35,450 --> 01:22:38,520
- What was in that room?

777
01:22:48,430 --> 01:22:50,532
What are you afraid that I’ll see?

778
01:22:57,105 --> 01:23:01,543
- See? There’s nothing.

779
01:23:01,576 --> 01:23:03,445
It’s empty.

780
01:23:16,091 --> 01:23:18,393
- What do you mean, I don’t have access to him?

781
01:23:18,426 --> 01:23:19,661
- NSA has decided

782
01:23:19,694 --> 01:23:24,532
to turn over study of the threat to Atheon.

783
01:23:24,566 --> 01:23:27,335
- But you’re head of the base.

784
01:23:27,369 --> 01:23:29,404
I thought you were in charge.

785
01:23:29,437 --> 01:23:31,272
- Well, I don’t set policy,

786
01:23:31,306 --> 01:23:33,641
and I still take orders.

787
01:23:33,675 --> 01:23:36,678
Aah!

788
01:23:36,711 --> 01:23:41,082
I can’t believe Talbot would go around me like this.

789
01:23:41,116 --> 01:23:45,286
Oh, there’s a lot of powerful people that want in on this.

790
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:49,324
Money to be made, lots of it.

791
01:23:53,895 --> 01:23:56,231
You know the worst part about all of this?

792
01:23:56,264 --> 01:23:58,867
When I had David Banner locked up

793
01:23:58,900 --> 01:24:00,435
and sent that kid away,

794
01:24:00,468 --> 01:24:01,636
I didn’t give that boy a second thought.

795
01:24:01,669 --> 01:24:04,439
He was just collateral damage.

796
01:24:04,472 --> 01:24:08,309
Well, he isn’t anymore, is he?

797
01:24:10,445 --> 01:24:12,414
- What can I do?

798
01:24:14,249 --> 01:24:16,184
- You can go home now.

799
01:24:16,217 --> 01:24:20,221
I’d tell you to go and say goodbye,

800
01:24:20,255 --> 01:24:22,223
but I’ve already been informed that for now

801
01:24:22,257 --> 01:24:25,193
all further contact is out of the question.

802
01:24:25,226 --> 01:24:27,629
- Right.

803
01:25:05,733 --> 01:25:07,769
- Hi, Bruce. How you feeling?

804
01:25:07,802 --> 01:25:10,638
Grub okay in here for you?

805
01:25:10,672 --> 01:25:13,208
- What do you want?

806
01:25:13,241 --> 01:25:15,343
- That’s a good question.

807
01:25:15,376 --> 01:25:16,644
See, I need your cells

808
01:25:16,678 --> 01:25:19,714
to trigger some chemical distress signals.

809
01:25:19,747 --> 01:25:23,284
You know, so you can turn a little green for me again

810
01:25:23,318 --> 01:25:26,621
and I can carve off a piece of the real you,

811
01:25:26,654 --> 01:25:31,593
analyze it, patent it, and make a fortune.

812
01:25:31,626 --> 01:25:33,795
Do you mind?

813
01:25:33,828 --> 01:25:36,664
- I’ll never let you.

814
01:25:36,698 --> 01:25:39,267
- I’m not sure you've got much of a choice.

815
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:40,802
- Ow!

816
01:25:40,835 --> 01:25:43,671
- Come on. Aren’t you feeling a little angry?

817
01:25:43,705 --> 01:25:45,573
After all, you’ve only got me to play with

818
01:25:45,607 --> 01:25:48,276
now that Betty’s dumped you and gone back to Berkeley.

819
01:25:48,309 --> 01:25:50,411
- Ow! You’re lying.

820
01:25:50,445 --> 01:25:52,814
- You know, for me, this is a win-win situation.

821
01:25:52,847 --> 01:25:55,683
You turn green and all these guys come in and kill you

822
01:25:55,717 --> 01:25:57,418
and I perform the autopsy.

823
01:25:57,452 --> 01:26:00,688
You don’t-- - Ow!

824
01:26:00,722 --> 01:26:02,490
And I mop the floor with you

825
01:26:02,524 --> 01:26:04,692
and, maybe by accident, go too far and break your neck.

826
01:26:04,726 --> 01:26:08,329
Bad science, maybe.

827
01:26:08,363 --> 01:26:10,298
But personally gratifying.

828
01:26:10,331 --> 01:26:11,699
- Ow!

829
01:26:11,733 --> 01:26:13,668
- Come on, Bruce.

830
01:26:13,701 --> 01:26:16,371
Let’s see what you got.

831
01:26:16,404 --> 01:26:18,740
- Never.

832
01:26:24,546 --> 01:26:26,748
- You know, consciously you may control it,

833
01:26:26,781 --> 01:26:30,618
but subconsciously, I bet that’s another story.

834
01:26:59,881 --> 01:27:03,685
All right, let’s jump-start those brain waves.

835
01:27:30,545 --> 01:27:32,747
- My dear Ms. Ross. - ( gasps )

836
01:27:32,780 --> 01:27:34,749
- Welcome back.

837
01:27:34,782 --> 01:27:36,851
- There are two guards right outside.

838
01:27:36,884 --> 01:27:38,553
- You don’t have to worry.

839
01:27:38,586 --> 01:27:42,690
I’m not angry with you, not anymore.

840
01:27:42,724 --> 01:27:44,659
- What do you want?

841
01:27:44,692 --> 01:27:47,829
- It’s over for me now. I know that.

842
01:27:47,862 --> 01:27:52,400
And soon it’ll be over for Bruce.

843
01:27:52,433 --> 01:27:54,702
That’s why I've come to you.

844
01:27:54,736 --> 01:27:58,339
To ask you if you could persuade your father,

845
01:27:58,373 --> 01:28:01,676
as a man, as a father himself,

846
01:28:01,709 --> 01:28:06,447
that if I turn myself in now peacefully

847
01:28:06,481 --> 01:28:08,850
and before he puts me away forever,

848
01:28:08,883 --> 01:28:12,820
that he would let me see my son

849
01:28:12,854 --> 01:28:14,722
for one last time.

850
01:28:14,756 --> 01:28:18,526
Would you do that for me?

851
01:28:20,662 --> 01:28:24,699
- It’s out of my father’s hands now.

852
01:28:27,735 --> 01:28:29,704
- I understand.

853
01:28:29,737 --> 01:28:31,706
He’s a puppet now.

854
01:28:31,739 --> 01:28:33,708
I don’t blame him.

855
01:28:33,741 --> 01:28:36,778
- You shouldn’t. You should blame yourself

856
01:28:36,811 --> 01:28:39,380
for what you’ve done to your son.

857
01:28:39,414 --> 01:28:42,717
- And what have I done to my son, Ms. Ross?

858
01:28:42,750 --> 01:28:47,855
Nothing. I tried to improve on the limits in myself.

859
01:28:47,889 --> 01:28:50,725
Myself, not him.

860
01:28:50,758 --> 01:28:52,860
Can you understand?

861
01:28:52,894 --> 01:28:55,463
To improve on nature, my nature.

862
01:28:55,496 --> 01:28:57,465
Knowledge of one’s self.

863
01:28:57,498 --> 01:28:59,600
It’s the only path to the truth

864
01:28:59,634 --> 01:29:04,605
that give men the power to go beyond God’s boundaries.

865
01:29:04,639 --> 01:29:07,742
- You know what’s beyond your boundaries?

866
01:29:07,775 --> 01:29:09,844
Other people.

867
01:29:09,877 --> 01:29:14,415
All you’ve given Bruce is fear.

868
01:29:14,449 --> 01:29:16,684
Fear of life.

869
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:22,523
- Fear.

870
01:29:22,557 --> 01:29:26,961
Perhaps, Ms. Ross.

871
01:29:26,994 --> 01:29:32,200
And loneliness, too, yes.

872
01:29:32,233 --> 01:29:37,772
I feel them both...

873
01:29:37,805 --> 01:29:44,545
but I have lived completely once.

874
01:29:44,579 --> 01:29:47,882
I was so much in love,

875
01:29:47,915 --> 01:29:52,954
and she so much wanted a baby, my baby.

876
01:30:00,595 --> 01:30:03,564
I could tell from the moment she conceived

877
01:30:03,598 --> 01:30:06,667
that it wasn’t the son I had given her,

878
01:30:06,701 --> 01:30:11,472
but something else, a monster maybe.

879
01:30:11,506 --> 01:30:13,775
I should have put a stop to it right then,

880
01:30:13,808 --> 01:30:16,577
but I was curious

881
01:30:16,611 --> 01:30:19,580
and that was my downfall.

882
01:30:19,614 --> 01:30:23,017
And as I watched this tiny little life unfold,

883
01:30:23,050 --> 01:30:26,554
I began to imagine the horror of it,

884
01:30:26,587 --> 01:30:33,895
and the curiosity was replaced with compassion.

885
01:30:35,730 --> 01:30:37,932
But they took away my chance to cure him.

886
01:30:37,965 --> 01:30:41,602
Your father threw me out.

887
01:30:41,636 --> 01:30:44,605
I remember the day so well,

888
01:30:44,639 --> 01:30:47,875
every moment, every sensation.

889
01:30:47,909 --> 01:30:49,644
Walking into the house,

890
01:30:49,677 --> 01:30:52,747
the feeling of the handle of the knife in my hand.

891
01:30:52,780 --> 01:30:55,616
I knew I was doing a father’s work,

892
01:30:55,650 --> 01:30:58,119
fulfilling a father’s mercy.

893
01:30:58,152 --> 01:31:01,589
- Edith: David, please stop it. No!

894
01:31:01,622 --> 01:31:04,091
( shouting )

895
01:31:04,125 --> 01:31:07,094
- But then she surprised me.

896
01:31:07,128 --> 01:31:09,063
- Aah!

897
01:31:09,096 --> 01:31:13,100
- No! No! David, no!

898
01:31:13,134 --> 01:31:22,710
- It was as if she and the knife merged.

899
01:31:30,985 --> 01:31:32,753
- No!

900
01:31:32,787 --> 01:31:39,994
- You can’t imagine the unbearable finality of it.

901
01:31:40,027 --> 01:31:43,097
And in that one moment,

902
01:31:43,130 --> 01:31:46,868
I took everything that was dear to me

903
01:31:46,901 --> 01:31:53,941
and transformed it into nothing more than a memory.

904
01:32:09,090 --> 01:32:12,827
- Bingo. That must be some jumbo nightmare he just had.

905
01:32:17,832 --> 01:32:19,934
Okay, do it now. Start the enzyme extraction.

906
01:32:25,072 --> 01:32:26,974
- Sir, negative on drill penetration.

907
01:32:27,008 --> 01:32:28,676
- Damn it, drill him harder.

908
01:32:28,709 --> 01:32:30,845
Give me full RPMs. Come on, Holman, come on.

909
01:32:44,859 --> 01:32:46,694
- Should I neutralize?

910
01:32:46,727 --> 01:32:49,163
- No! I can’t do anything with goop. Come on!

911
01:32:58,205 --> 01:33:01,676
- ( roars )

912
01:33:01,709 --> 01:33:03,044
- All right, put him to sleep.

913
01:33:09,884 --> 01:33:13,721
- Ah...ah...ah-choo!

914
01:33:13,754 --> 01:33:15,890
- It’s not stopping him.

915
01:33:22,730 --> 01:33:25,132
- Ready Room, send in our containment team.

916
01:33:25,166 --> 01:33:28,069
Nonlethals only. I repeat, nonlethals only.

917
01:33:28,102 --> 01:33:30,004
I must have a sample of him.

918
01:33:30,037 --> 01:33:31,639
- Sir!

919
01:33:33,975 --> 01:33:35,943
- Jesus.

920
01:33:35,977 --> 01:33:37,278
- Hit him with the foam.

921
01:33:37,311 --> 01:33:40,114
- Deploy containment foam team.

922
01:33:40,147 --> 01:33:42,817
- Talbot, talk to me.

923
01:33:44,251 --> 01:33:46,153
- Under control, General.

924
01:33:46,187 --> 01:33:47,154
I’ll let you know if we need you.

925
01:33:47,188 --> 01:33:48,756
- Unacceptable.

926
01:33:48,789 --> 01:33:50,224
Unseat your asses down there immediately.

927
01:33:50,257 --> 01:33:52,126
I want a full-court evacuation now.

928
01:33:52,159 --> 01:33:54,228
I’m shutting you down. - Lock down.

929
01:33:54,261 --> 01:33:56,130
- Didn’t you hear what the general said?

930
01:33:56,163 --> 01:33:58,099
- I said lock down!

931
01:34:00,101 --> 01:34:02,670
Clear! I need a sample of him.

932
01:34:05,106 --> 01:34:08,776
All right, take it easy there, buddy.

933
01:34:08,809 --> 01:34:11,045
This might give you a bit of a sting here, Bruce.

934
01:34:22,223 --> 01:34:24,725
- ( growls )

935
01:34:24,759 --> 01:34:26,494
- Fall back! Fall back!

936
01:34:26,527 --> 01:34:27,962
- Clear your weapons! Clear!

937
01:34:27,995 --> 01:34:31,799
- Give me the M-2! So long, big boy.

938
01:34:31,832 --> 01:34:33,234
- Clear!

939
01:34:38,105 --> 01:34:40,074
- Aah!

940
01:34:43,844 --> 01:34:46,781
- Lock down the entire facility immediately.

941
01:34:50,885 --> 01:34:53,521
- The target’s still moving towards Blue Level.

942
01:34:53,554 --> 01:34:55,723
- Evacuate the main hall.

943
01:34:59,994 --> 01:35:01,362
- ( roars )

944
01:35:01,395 --> 01:35:03,264
- Send in backup. Heavy weapons.

945
01:35:03,297 --> 01:35:05,733
Issue general quarters.

946
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:35,129
- Contamination, sir. System readings are redline.

947
01:35:35,162 --> 01:35:36,897
- Data’s on backup power supply.

948
01:35:43,871 --> 01:35:45,072
- Incoming!

949
01:35:53,047 --> 01:35:55,149
- Shut down all power to the main hall.

950
01:35:55,182 --> 01:35:57,885
- Sir? - Show him the way out.

951
01:35:57,918 --> 01:35:59,887
We’ll fight him outside.

952
01:38:09,283 --> 01:38:12,019
- Driver, stop. Driver, stop.

953
01:38:18,192 --> 01:38:21,929
- Gunner, traverse left. Traverse left.

954
01:38:24,265 --> 01:38:26,333
Aah!

955
01:39:01,535 --> 01:39:03,170
- Whoa!

956
01:40:00,494 --> 01:40:04,631
- Mr. President, I have some bad news, sir.

957
01:40:04,665 --> 01:40:06,300
- Let’s have it, General.

958
01:40:06,333 --> 01:40:07,634
- I have briefed the president on Angry Man.

959
01:40:07,668 --> 01:40:09,636
I assume that’s what this is about.

960
01:40:09,670 --> 01:40:11,505
- It is, ma’am.

961
01:40:11,538 --> 01:40:15,075
I’m requesting a National Command Authority override.

962
01:40:15,109 --> 01:40:17,144
Angry Man is unsecure.

963
01:40:17,177 --> 01:40:20,147
I need everything we have at my disposal

964
01:40:20,180 --> 01:40:22,316
in order to stop his movement.

965
01:40:22,349 --> 01:40:24,685
- You’re expecting civilian casualties, General?

966
01:40:24,718 --> 01:40:27,488
- Not if I can help it, ma’am.

967
01:40:27,521 --> 01:40:30,057
- Consider it done. Keep us posted.

968
01:41:18,572 --> 01:41:21,208
- Contact Goodman control.

969
01:41:21,241 --> 01:41:23,143
Patch data to the assets.

970
01:41:23,177 --> 01:41:24,745
Contact H.Q.

971
01:41:24,778 --> 01:41:29,216
Have them initiate an immediate evacuation

972
01:41:29,249 --> 01:41:35,422
in vicinity of grid coordinates 653-216.

973
01:42:09,656 --> 01:42:11,959
Confirm that the area’s been cleared.

974
01:42:11,992 --> 01:42:13,494
- Confirm area cleared.

975
01:42:13,527 --> 01:42:15,395
- H.Q. confirms area clear.

976
01:42:15,429 --> 01:42:16,730
Assets online, sir.

977
01:42:16,763 --> 01:42:19,266
- Gentlemen, it’s time to dig in.

978
01:42:19,299 --> 01:42:22,603
I want this target stopped in his tracks.

979
01:43:12,786 --> 01:43:14,755
- Jesus.

980
01:43:29,836 --> 01:43:31,705
- Mayday! Mayday!

981
01:43:31,738 --> 01:43:33,507
Aw, shit!

982
01:43:38,645 --> 01:43:40,414
- Tango Four is down!

983
01:43:40,447 --> 01:43:43,684
Have C-SAR respond to our 20 ASAP!

984
01:43:43,717 --> 01:43:45,686
- We’re okay, but get him off of us

985
01:43:45,719 --> 01:43:46,787
before he tears us apart!

986
01:43:46,820 --> 01:43:48,055
- I’ve got no shot.

987
01:43:48,088 --> 01:43:50,591
Do you have a clear line of fire?

988
01:43:50,624 --> 01:43:51,825
- Watch it, Tango flight.

989
01:43:51,858 --> 01:43:54,394
- Break left! Break left!

990
01:43:54,428 --> 01:43:56,630
- Tango Three, pull back

991
01:43:56,663 --> 01:43:58,398
and set up for a hellfire shot.

992
01:43:58,432 --> 01:44:01,401
- Hold your fire till we draw him off.

993
01:44:01,435 --> 01:44:02,869
- Tango One is hot. Gun wazzed.

994
01:44:02,903 --> 01:44:04,671
- Roger. Going out, gun ready.

995
01:44:10,744 --> 01:44:12,479
- Engage at will.

996
01:44:18,852 --> 01:44:20,687
- ( growls )

997
01:44:33,433 --> 01:44:35,335
- Tango One, pull back. Clear my line.

998
01:44:35,369 --> 01:44:37,771
- Tango flight, clear back.

999
01:44:37,804 --> 01:44:39,673
I’ve got him painted for hellfire.

1000
01:44:41,842 --> 01:44:44,411
- Tango One, clear. Take your shot.

1001
01:45:02,529 --> 01:45:05,666
- Tango One, Tango Three, I have contact.

1002
01:45:05,699 --> 01:45:06,967
Holy shit! He’s got my missile!

1003
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:08,335
- ( spits )

1004
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:16,943
Mayday! Mayday! We’re going down!

1005
01:45:20,881 --> 01:45:22,849
- Give me a head count.

1006
01:45:22,883 --> 01:45:26,687
- Tango Three, give me a sit rep.

1007
01:45:26,720 --> 01:45:29,356
- Our kite’s busted up, but we’re okay.

1008
01:45:31,491 --> 01:45:34,561
- Tango flight, do you have eyes on the target?

1009
01:45:34,594 --> 01:45:36,563
- Tango One, I have him in the rocks.

1010
01:45:36,596 --> 01:45:39,499
- Salvo all. Turn it into a parking lot.

1011
01:45:59,753 --> 01:46:02,622
- T-Bolt, your parking lot is ready.

1012
01:46:02,656 --> 01:46:05,625
We’re bingo for fuel and ammo. RTB.

1013
01:46:32,819 --> 01:46:35,489
- T-Bolt, this is Goodman control.

1014
01:46:35,522 --> 01:46:36,923
Be advised target not destroyed.

1015
01:46:36,957 --> 01:46:38,792
He’s on the move again.

1016
01:46:38,825 --> 01:46:40,594
- Damn!

1017
01:46:40,627 --> 01:46:42,796
I’ve got it.

1018
01:46:42,829 --> 01:46:45,766
It appears he’s heading home.

1019
01:46:45,799 --> 01:46:47,234
Launch fast movers.

1020
01:46:47,267 --> 01:46:50,971
Have them intercept and engage.

1021
01:46:51,004 --> 01:46:52,639
( cell phone rings )

1022
01:46:52,672 --> 01:46:55,776
- Hello? - Betty, Bruce got out.

1023
01:46:55,809 --> 01:46:59,079
He’s headed your way probably right for you.

1024
01:46:59,112 --> 01:47:00,814
How far from the base are you?

1025
01:47:00,847 --> 01:47:02,516
- I’m already here.

1026
01:47:02,549 --> 01:47:03,917
They’re taking his father in now.

1027
01:47:03,950 --> 01:47:06,686
- That’s all good news.

1028
01:47:06,720 --> 01:47:08,655
Stay there, Betty.

1029
01:47:21,968 --> 01:47:23,603
- Legend One rolling in hot.

1030
01:47:23,637 --> 01:47:25,572
Legend Two breaking off left.

1031
01:47:25,605 --> 01:47:29,709
- I think I can come back around for a gun attack.

1032
01:47:29,743 --> 01:47:32,913
- Acquire a clear target and fire at will.

1033
01:47:37,083 --> 01:47:39,853
He’s out of it. Civilian aircraft.

1034
01:47:39,886 --> 01:47:41,588
- Aah!

1035
01:47:45,025 --> 01:47:46,960
- Pull up! Pull up!

1036
01:47:46,993 --> 01:47:48,662
You’re headed for the bridge!

1037
01:47:48,695 --> 01:47:49,830
- Aah!

1038
01:47:49,863 --> 01:47:51,832
I can’t pull up! I can’t pull up!

1039
01:48:00,774 --> 01:48:02,008
- Okay, you’ve got him now.

1040
01:48:02,042 --> 01:48:03,677
Take him on a ride to the top of the world.

1041
01:48:03,710 --> 01:48:05,879
Let’s see what the thin air will do for him.

1042
01:48:07,714 --> 01:48:09,583
- Initiating afterburner.

1043
01:48:25,899 --> 01:48:29,002
I’m passing flight level 600.

1044
01:48:29,035 --> 01:48:31,338
This is out of my envelope.

1045
01:48:31,371 --> 01:48:34,608
- Hang in there, Legend. - I can’t maintain.

1046
01:48:34,641 --> 01:48:35,909
He’s all over my aerodynamics.

1047
01:48:35,942 --> 01:48:39,079
- He’ll lose consciousness before you.

1048
01:48:42,883 --> 01:48:46,186
- 950. I can’t hold it.

1049
01:48:46,219 --> 01:48:48,555
I’m pulling back!

1050
01:48:54,928 --> 01:48:58,565
Aah!

1051
01:49:34,868 --> 01:49:37,137
- Puny human.

1052
01:49:45,011 --> 01:49:47,113
- Contact. In the water.

1053
01:49:47,147 --> 01:49:48,982
All units, weapons hot.

1054
01:49:49,015 --> 01:49:50,984
- Let’s not take any chances.

1055
01:49:51,017 --> 01:49:53,820
You are cleared to fire on target, Legend.

1056
01:50:16,142 --> 01:50:18,178
- Dad? - Betty.

1057
01:50:18,211 --> 01:50:21,014
I don’t have a choice.

1058
01:50:21,047 --> 01:50:22,882
I have to destroy him.

1059
01:50:22,916 --> 01:50:25,251
- But you can’t. You’ll only fuel his rage

1060
01:50:25,285 --> 01:50:28,154
and you will make him stronger.

1061
01:50:28,188 --> 01:50:32,025
- It’s you he's coming for. You know that.

1062
01:50:32,058 --> 01:50:37,897
- Then let me go to him. Please.

1063
01:50:37,931 --> 01:50:41,968
Just give him a chance to calm down.

1064
01:50:55,215 --> 01:50:57,250
( screaming )

1065
01:51:01,054 --> 01:51:03,990
- All aircraft, vicinity San Francisco.

1066
01:51:04,024 --> 01:51:05,992
This is T-Bolt on guard.

1067
01:51:06,026 --> 01:51:09,796
This area has been declared restricted airspace.

1068
01:51:09,829 --> 01:51:14,234
All aircraft are ordered to clear the airspace immediately.

1069
01:51:20,240 --> 01:51:22,008
- ( roars )

1070
01:51:55,208 --> 01:51:58,978
- Echo 1-9er. Weapons are hot, target acquired.

1071
01:51:59,012 --> 01:52:00,246
Awaiting your orders to engage.

1072
01:52:00,280 --> 01:52:03,249
Repeat. Awaiting your orders to engage.

1073
01:52:03,283 --> 01:52:06,853
- Command code yellow. Hold for authorization.

1074
01:52:16,029 --> 01:52:18,098
- All units, hold your fire.

1075
01:52:18,131 --> 01:52:21,401
- All assets, hold your fire.

1076
01:52:21,434 --> 01:52:23,803
I repeat, hold your fire.

1077
01:52:30,143 --> 01:52:33,079
( sirens )

1078
01:54:27,427 --> 01:54:30,697
- You found me.

1079
01:54:30,730 --> 01:54:33,933
- You weren’t that hard to find.

1080
01:54:36,369 --> 01:54:38,371
- Yes, I was.

1081
01:55:26,286 --> 01:55:29,255
- ( crying )

1082
01:55:43,236 --> 01:55:45,171
- Come on, let’s take a walk.

1083
01:56:17,403 --> 01:56:19,238
- That’s the deal, gentlemen.

1084
01:56:19,272 --> 01:56:21,107
He stays on this base

1085
01:56:21,140 --> 01:56:22,542
until we get the final word from C-3

1086
01:56:22,575 --> 01:56:24,377
on how to dispose of him.

1087
01:56:24,410 --> 01:56:26,079
In the meantime,

1088
01:56:26,112 --> 01:56:29,082
if he does anything but sit there in that chair,

1089
01:56:29,115 --> 01:56:31,484
I’m gonna turn on the juice

1090
01:56:31,517 --> 01:56:34,487
and he’ll be incinerated immediately.

1091
01:56:34,520 --> 01:56:37,190
- We’ve established a 200-yard perimeter, sir.

1092
01:56:37,223 --> 01:56:39,425
If we deploy the electromagnetic array,

1093
01:56:39,459 --> 01:56:41,627
there should be no collateral damage.

1094
01:56:50,303 --> 01:56:53,139
- I’m doing this for you, Betty.

1095
01:56:53,172 --> 01:56:54,507
One way or another,

1096
01:56:54,540 --> 01:56:58,044
we’re gonna have to prepare for the worst.

1097
01:58:46,586 --> 01:58:49,956
- I should have killed you.

1098
01:58:49,989 --> 01:58:52,725
- And I should have killed you.

1099
01:58:52,758 --> 01:58:55,394
- I wish you had.

1100
01:59:01,267 --> 01:59:04,537
I saw her last night.

1101
01:59:04,570 --> 01:59:07,974
Saw her face.

1102
01:59:08,007 --> 01:59:11,410
Brown hair.

1103
01:59:11,444 --> 01:59:13,980
Brown eyes.

1104
01:59:14,013 --> 01:59:17,250
She smiled at me.

1105
01:59:17,283 --> 01:59:21,420
She reached down and kissed my cheek.

1106
01:59:21,454 --> 01:59:25,191
I can almost remember her smell.

1107
01:59:28,528 --> 01:59:31,264
It was like desert flowers.

1108
01:59:33,332 --> 01:59:35,268
- Her favorite perfume.

1109
01:59:38,337 --> 01:59:39,805
- It’s my mother.

1110
01:59:39,839 --> 01:59:42,675
I don’t even know her name.

1111
01:59:45,678 --> 01:59:49,849
( crying )

1112
01:59:49,882 --> 01:59:52,351
- Sorry, son.

1113
01:59:52,385 --> 01:59:54,353
Go ahead and cry.

1114
02:00:00,760 --> 02:00:02,762
Go ahead and cry.

1115
02:00:06,699 --> 02:00:09,702
Cry, all right?

1116
02:00:09,735 --> 02:00:12,605
- Don’t touch me!

1117
02:00:12,638 --> 02:00:17,043
Maybe once you were my father,

1118
02:00:17,076 --> 02:00:19,645
but you’re not now and you never will be.

1119
02:00:19,679 --> 02:00:23,416
- Oh, is that so?

1120
02:00:23,449 --> 02:00:25,751
Well, I got news for you.

1121
02:00:25,785 --> 02:00:29,322
I didn’t come here to see you.

1122
02:00:29,355 --> 02:00:32,425
I came here to see my son,

1123
02:00:32,458 --> 02:00:35,661
my real son,

1124
02:00:35,695 --> 02:00:37,863
the one inside of you.

1125
02:00:37,897 --> 02:00:42,068
You’re nothing but a superficial shell,

1126
02:00:42,101 --> 02:00:44,637
a husk of flimsy consciousness

1127
02:00:44,670 --> 02:00:47,807
ready to be torn off at a moment’s notice.

1128
02:00:47,840 --> 02:00:49,742
- You can think what you like.

1129
02:00:49,775 --> 02:00:53,546
I don’t care. Just go!

1130
02:00:56,949 --> 02:00:59,385
- No, son, listen to me.

1131
02:00:59,418 --> 02:01:03,589
I found a cure for me.

1132
02:01:03,623 --> 02:01:06,425
My cells can transform, too.

1133
02:01:06,459 --> 02:01:08,928
Absorb enormous amounts of energy.

1134
02:01:08,961 --> 02:01:11,664
But unlike you, they’re unstable.

1135
02:01:11,697 --> 02:01:15,935
Son, I need your strength.

1136
02:01:15,968 --> 02:01:19,538
I gave you life.

1137
02:01:19,572 --> 02:01:22,908
Now you must give it back to me,

1138
02:01:22,942 --> 02:01:28,414
only a million times more radiant, more powerful.

1139
02:01:28,447 --> 02:01:29,749
- Stop!

1140
02:01:29,782 --> 02:01:34,820
- Stop what? Stop what?

1141
02:01:34,854 --> 02:01:38,824
Think about all those men out there in their uniforms

1142
02:01:38,858 --> 02:01:41,827
barking and swallowing orders,

1143
02:01:41,861 --> 02:01:46,432
inflicting their petty rule over the entire globe.

1144
02:01:46,465 --> 02:01:50,703
Think of all the harm they’ve done to you,

1145
02:01:50,736 --> 02:01:54,640
to me, to humanity.

1146
02:01:54,674 --> 02:01:56,542
And know this.

1147
02:01:56,575 --> 02:01:57,943
That we can make them and their flags

1148
02:01:57,977 --> 02:02:00,813
and their anthems and governments

1149
02:02:00,846 --> 02:02:03,416
disappear in a flash.

1150
02:02:03,449 --> 02:02:05,685
You and me.

1151
02:02:05,718 --> 02:02:08,554
- I’d rather die.

1152
02:02:08,587 --> 02:02:11,724
- Oh, that’s your answer.

1153
02:02:11,757 --> 02:02:17,763
And indeed you shall die and be reborn a hero

1154
02:02:17,797 --> 02:02:19,999
of the kind that walked the Earth

1155
02:02:20,032 --> 02:02:24,537
long before the pale religions of civilization

1156
02:02:24,570 --> 02:02:27,406
infected humanity’s soul.

1157
02:02:27,440 --> 02:02:30,376
- Go!

1158
02:02:38,517 --> 02:02:41,387
- Whaa whaa whaa.

1159
02:02:44,457 --> 02:02:46,592
Stop your bawling,

1160
02:02:46,625 --> 02:02:50,629
you weak little speck of human trash.

1161
02:02:58,637 --> 02:03:00,406
I’ll go.

1162
02:03:01,807 --> 02:03:03,843
You just watch me go!

1163
02:03:03,876 --> 02:03:05,578
- Hit it.

1164
02:03:06,812 --> 02:03:09,415
- Aah!

1165
02:03:15,588 --> 02:03:22,962
- ( roars )

1166
02:03:30,903 --> 02:03:32,004
- Hit it again. - We can’t, sir.

1167
02:03:32,037 --> 02:03:33,672
There’s no power.

1168
02:03:33,706 --> 02:03:35,975
Some kind of counterelectromagnetic field.

1169
02:03:40,613 --> 02:03:43,482
- Move in and assault the target. Move in!

1170
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,670
- Sir, I’ve located them on radar. Pear Lake.

1171
02:04:37,703 --> 02:04:40,039
- Call up the task force.

1172
02:04:47,079 --> 02:04:48,981
- Yes.

1173
02:05:06,765 --> 02:05:08,667
- ( roars )

1174
02:05:54,179 --> 02:05:57,683
- That’s right. Keep fighting.

1175
02:05:57,716 --> 02:06:01,820
The more you fight, the more of you I take.

1176
02:06:09,662 --> 02:06:11,096
- Strange.

1177
02:06:11,130 --> 02:06:14,700
We’re reading a phenomenal drop in temperatures there.

1178
02:06:14,733 --> 02:06:16,101
Simultaneous radiological activity.

1179
02:06:16,135 --> 02:06:19,672
- They’re absorbing all the ambient energy.

1180
02:06:28,113 --> 02:06:29,882
- Relax.

1181
02:06:29,915 --> 02:06:33,652
- Sleep now, Bruce, and forget forever.

1182
02:06:33,686 --> 02:06:35,754
Struggle no more

1183
02:06:35,788 --> 02:06:39,992
and give me all of your power.

1184
02:06:40,025 --> 02:06:42,194
- Do you think you can live with it?

1185
02:06:42,227 --> 02:06:44,096
Take it.

1186
02:06:44,129 --> 02:06:47,666
Take it all!

1187
02:06:49,835 --> 02:06:51,704
- Yes.

1188
02:06:51,737 --> 02:06:55,174
Yes.

1189
02:06:55,207 --> 02:06:59,178
- ( roars )

1190
02:07:00,813 --> 02:07:06,218
Oh, yes!

1191
02:07:06,251 --> 02:07:08,787
Take it back.

1192
02:07:10,856 --> 02:07:13,759
It’s not stopping.

1193
02:07:13,792 --> 02:07:16,195
Take it back!

1194
02:07:20,933 --> 02:07:23,869
( screaming and groaning )

1195
02:07:32,277 --> 02:07:35,280
- Gentlemen, release.

1196
02:07:43,022 --> 02:07:44,957
- Gamma charge away.

1197
02:08:09,882 --> 02:08:11,850
- Sweet dreams.

1198
02:08:56,028 --> 02:08:58,997
( telephone rings )

1199
02:08:59,031 --> 02:09:00,799
( ring )

1200
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:05,003
( ring )

1201
02:09:05,037 --> 02:09:06,238
- Hello?

1202
02:09:06,271 --> 02:09:07,873
- Betty? That you?

1203
02:09:07,906 --> 02:09:09,007
- Dad?

1204
02:09:09,041 --> 02:09:10,576
- I’m glad I caught you.

1205
02:09:10,609 --> 02:09:12,144
- I’m glad you called.

1206
02:09:12,177 --> 02:09:14,179
- Thanks.

1207
02:09:14,213 --> 02:09:19,585
Look, Betty, you and I have...

1208
02:09:19,618 --> 02:09:21,253
Well, we both know

1209
02:09:21,286 --> 02:09:24,256
that Bruce couldn’t have survived that blast.

1210
02:09:24,289 --> 02:09:29,161
But, well, you know...

1211
02:09:29,194 --> 02:09:31,029
- What is it?

1212
02:09:31,063 --> 02:09:35,134
- Aw, you know, the usual loonies seeing things,

1213
02:09:35,167 --> 02:09:37,936
only now everything’s green.

1214
02:09:37,970 --> 02:09:41,173
- ( laughs ) Right.

1215
02:09:41,206 --> 02:09:48,046
- Look, if by some chance he did survive,

1216
02:09:48,080 --> 02:09:52,050
he should try to contact you, try to get in touch,

1217
02:09:52,084 --> 02:09:54,820
you’d tell me, wouldn’t you?

1218
02:09:56,421 --> 02:10:00,325
- No, I wouldn’t.

1219
02:10:00,359 --> 02:10:04,096
But you know as well as I do I wouldn’t have to.

1220
02:10:04,129 --> 02:10:06,365
I mean, my phones are bugged.

1221
02:10:06,398 --> 02:10:10,369
My computer’s tapped. I’m under surveillance.

1222
02:10:10,402 --> 02:10:16,308
I’ll tell you, though, that if he were alive,

1223
02:10:16,341 --> 02:10:19,411
I’m the last person I would want him to come to.

1224
02:10:19,444 --> 02:10:23,415
Because as much as I miss him,

1225
02:10:23,448 --> 02:10:30,989
I...I loved him, but I...

1226
02:10:31,023 --> 02:10:34,493
- Yeah.

1227
02:10:34,526 --> 02:10:38,230
I’m sorry, Betty.

1228
02:10:38,263 --> 02:10:41,166
I am so sorry.

1229
02:10:43,135 --> 02:10:45,871
- I know you are.

1230
02:11:18,203 --> 02:11:22,274

1231
02:11:22,307 --> 02:11:23,442
