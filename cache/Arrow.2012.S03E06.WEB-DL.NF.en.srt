311
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:24,330
But if the arrows were thrown
with <i>Mirakuru</i> force...

312
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:29,502
What if there was some residual <i>Mirakuru</i>
in your system, would explain the forensics.

313
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:31,295
The angle and force of the arrows.

314
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:36,050
-But you said I tested negative for <i>Mirakuru.</i>
-There isn't any in your blood today...

315
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:39,845
...but if one last <i>Mirakuru</i>episode
burned out any remnants in your system...

316
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,681
Episode?

317
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:46,644
You mean me killing Sara?

318
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:03,828
-I'm on site.
-Copy. Keep watching the perimeter.

319
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:07,665
-How many partners do you have, anyway?
-The Culebras, the body in your gym.

320
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:09,125
Body in your storage locker.

321
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,628
Someone's gone to a lot of trouble
to frame you and bring you here. Why?

322
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:15,756
What does all this have to do
with one killing six years ago?

323
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:17,341
Hello, Ted.

324
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:19,677
I see you got my messages.

325
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:23,723
Arrows.

326
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:29,103
Brass knuckles. I never knew why we
couldn't just use a gun the way they did.

327
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:33,858
We're better than they are.
At least, we're supposed to be.

328
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:36,193
That's almost ironic coming from you.

329
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,528
I trusted you.

330
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:44,535
OFFICER:
S.C.P.D.!

331
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:50,249
You're under arrest
for multiple counts of homicide.

332
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,837
What are you talking about? I didn't do this.

333
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:57,590
Yeah? Tell that to the stiff
we found in your locker.

334
00:20:58,007 --> 00:20:59,216
Let's go.

335
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:06,974
DIGGLE: He got past me. He knew an exit out
of the building that wasn't on the blueprints...

336
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:10,478
-...that Felicity hooked me up with.
-You had Ted Grant arrested?

337
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:14,565
Your father's men found him at a crime scene.
A body was found at a storage locker...

338
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:17,485
...that he owns, along with evidence
of past vigilantism.

339
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,069
-No. He's innocent.
-I know.

340
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,655
-I saw the person who's doing this.
-Who is it?

341
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:27,411
He was wearing Ted's old gear.
Full face mask. Let's go.

342
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:31,624
Clearly Grant knows who's behind the mask.

343
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,460
Oliver, Laurel.

344
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:36,462
-I...
-What's up?

345
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,297
I have to...

346
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:39,965
Roy, don't.

347
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,802
-Let's just...
-I need to tell you something.

348
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,053
Okay.

349
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,932
I...

350
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,561
I killed Sara.

351
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:57,817
That doesn't...

352
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:00,027
You're not making any sense.

353
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,572
Why would you kill Sara?

354
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:04,824
It was the <i>Mirakuru.</i>

355
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,909
Roy had no memory of the attack.

356
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:08,410
No real memory, at least.

357
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:12,873
But he's been recalling fragments
of his <i>Mirakuru</i> exposure last year.

358
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:17,211
That, and suppressed memories
often resurface in dreams.

359
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:20,089
What...? This is insane.

360
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:23,092
Laurel, I'm so sorry.

361
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:24,426
-I'm really...
-Don't...

362
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:32,268
-Wait, Roy, where do you think you're going?
-Let him go.

363
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:44,029
I thought he was cured.

364
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:46,991
What we know about <i>Mirakuru</i>
is vastly outweighed...

365
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:50,953
-...by the things we don't know.
-What does that even mean?

366
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:53,789
That Roy killed my sister
and it's not his fault?

367
00:22:56,584 --> 00:23:00,129
The arrows that killed Sara,
we pulled DNA off of them, didn't we?

368
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:03,299
I tested it against the sample of Roy's blood.
First thing I did.

369
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:05,134
And?

370
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:07,720
The results were inconclusive.

371
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:11,181
I can't process this right now.

372
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:17,771
Hey. Hey, look at me.

373
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:21,233
Focus on what you can process.

374
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:23,193
Ted knows who we're coming after.

375
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,403
I need you to find out who it is.

376
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:28,782
I can't. I can't. If Roy killed Sara...

377
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:31,160
If Roy killed Sara...

378
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:34,663
...then we will deal with it.

379
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:40,544
But right now, I need you to deal with Ted.

380
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:43,839
Okay?

381
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:46,342
Okay.

382
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,230
How sure are you?

383
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:03,692
There's other forensic evidence.

384
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:08,446
A virtual autopsy. In light of what Roy's
described, it sounds incriminating.

385
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:12,910
That, and his trouble sleeping
started right when Sara was killed.

386
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:25,255
My husband says you're having problems
remembering what you saw earlier today.

387
00:24:25,756 --> 00:24:27,800
That's the problem.

388
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:29,635
I didn't see anything.

389
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:32,554
You see and hear far more than you think.

390
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:36,141
Hidden truths,
buried deep in your subconscious.

391
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:39,019
You saw something,
but your head is too busy.

392
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:41,355
You need to quiet it.

393
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:44,858
Close your eyes.

394
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:51,615
Take a deep breath.

395
00:24:51,949 --> 00:24:56,078
In through your nose,
out through your mouth.

396
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:58,539
In...

397
00:24:58,706 --> 00:25:00,249
...and out...

398
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,583
...and again.

399
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,546
You're floating in nothingness.

400
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:08,090
All that exists is your breath.

401
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:10,843
Any thoughts you have are clouds.

402
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:14,013
They just drift away.

403
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:21,478
I remember.

404
00:25:25,274 --> 00:25:27,860
Sixteen murders.

405
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:31,739
Seventeen,
counting the one from six years ago.

406
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:36,243
That's more than Son of Sam,
less than Bundy.

407
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:39,413
Probably worth a miniseries, huh?
Maybe a book.

408
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,835
You became a defense attorney?

409
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:47,212
Can I talk to him for a minute?

410
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:48,922
[LANCE SIGHS]

411
00:25:54,595 --> 00:25:56,764
You sure can pick them.

412
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:07,149
You okay?

413
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:09,485
I'm not the one facing a lifetime in prison.

414
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:12,905
-Who framed you?
-I don't know.

415
00:26:14,865 --> 00:26:17,451
I can't help you
if you're gonna keep lying to me.

416
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:21,538
The Arrow saw you with him.
He knows you know who it is.

417
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:23,749
Hey.

418
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:27,169
If the DA's office refuses
to seek an indictment...

419
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:29,004
...the police have to release you.

420
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:34,176
But first, I'm gonna need you
to be straight with me.

421
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:37,054
Who is the man behind the mask?

422
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:42,101
His name is Isaac Stanzler.

423
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:46,980
Six years ago, the Culebras ran the Glades.

424
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,983
I thought it'd be a good idea
for families to live there...

425
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,653
...without worrying
about their kids getting shot.

426
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,780
So I decided to do something about it.

427
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:56,532
You became a vigilante.

428
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:59,159
Just like your friend in the green hood.

429
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:01,829
Without the green hood.

430
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:03,247
And what about Stanzler?

431
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:08,043
You know the guy that Arrow's been
running around with lately? The one in red?

432
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:12,881
Stanzler was my guy in red.
I guess you could call him my apprentice.

433
00:27:13,924 --> 00:27:18,846
One night, we decided to go after this drug
dealer that was pushing crank near the school.

434
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:22,349
We tracked him
all the way to this nightclub...

435
00:27:22,516 --> 00:27:23,725
And what happened?

436
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:27,437
That drug dealer...

437
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:30,648
...Isaac got to him first.

438
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:36,405
That murder from six years ago,
that wasn't you.

439
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:37,781
That was him.

440
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:43,704
-I hung it up after that.
-And what about Stanzler?

441
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:47,916
What happened to Isaac Stanzler?

442
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,586
I told him to get the hell out of Starling.

443
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:53,839
That I never wanted
to see his face ever again.

444
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:56,925
I cut him loose.

445
00:27:59,887 --> 00:28:02,806
That's why I've been lying to you
this whole time, Laurel.

446
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:06,852
Everything that's happening is my fault.

447
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:12,191
No word from Laurel?

448
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:16,528
Not yet. According to S.C.P.D. e-mail traffic,
which I may or may not have hacked into...

449
00:28:16,694 --> 00:28:19,281
...they are dropping the charges
against Ted Grant.

450
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:22,284
Let me go after Roy.
If he's experiencing side effects...

451
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:27,206
-...we can't leave him running around.
-So you bring him in, then what?

452
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:31,709
Oliver, this crusade of ours,
it's supposed to be about justice, right?

453
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:35,130
If that's supposed to mean something,
we can't have two sets of rules.

454
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:36,965
One for bad guys and one for us.

455
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:39,551
I'm the one who brought Roy
into this crusade.

456
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:42,012
And maybe it's time for you
to cut him loose.

457
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:46,058
-Are you telling me to abandon him?
-Yes, Oliver.

458
00:28:47,601 --> 00:28:49,853
If that's what it takes
to find justice for Sara.

459
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,696
So, what do you think
Stanzler's next move is?

460
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:03,408
Framing me didn't work. I'm afraid
to think of what he might try to do next.

461
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,827
ISAAC:
What I should've done from the start.

462
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,999
After you abandoned me
the Culebra found me.

463
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,710
They wanted payback for the man they lost.

464
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:17,589
They tortured me for months
before I escaped.

465
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:20,717
