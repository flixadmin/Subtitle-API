1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,480
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,520
Word of the chemical spill
reached the mainland.

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,080
Reunification isn't happening.

4
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,080
No action until the Government
can determine if Gotham is safe.

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,760
I sentence you, Victor Zsasz,
to die.

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,720
Get him out of there.

7
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,920
What the hell are you doing?

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,400
Trying to keep you all
from making a terrible mistake.

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,360
- Her name is Ivy.
- She's a witch.

10
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,880
I'm feeding the earth
with these wretched creatures.

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,880
It consumes them,
and then it flourishes.

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,080
We wouldn't have escaped without you.

13
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,920
You saved me and my friends.
I wanted to help.

14
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:40,920
Come with us.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,080
Are you telling me you found a way
out of Gotham?

16
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,400
It's a submarine.

17
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,560
I've been giving you space,

18
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,160
but we have to talk about
how this is gonna work.

19
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,520
I'm gonna be a part
of this kid's life.

20
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,400
Oh, you seem pretty confident
about that.

21
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,080
- I am.
- You're having a baby with Barbara.

22
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,440
Can't change the past so,
I guess we just have to live with it.

23
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,960
Come on, people, time's a-wasting.

24
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,120
The filtration system
that Lucius designed is working.

25
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,000
What you're doing is both
unnecessary, and it's reckless.

26
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,000
Our supplies of drinking water
are at critical levels.

27
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,120
Every day the gangs
get more aggressive.

28
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,440
If I can get a cease-fire,
even a temporary one,

29
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,560
then when reunification does happen,

30
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,560
at least there will be people
left to save.

31
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,680
They deserve that much.

32
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,320
And does your child deserve a father?

33
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,600
You have no problem taking care
of the entire city.

34
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,320
What about focusing on just one life?

35
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,560
Why are you always so ready
to put yourself in the cross-hairs?

36
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,520
It's like you won't be satisfied
until you sacrifice yourself.

37
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,360
- You really believe that?
- I do.

38
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,560
And it scares me.

39
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,640
How is this gonna work?

40
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,520
Am I supposed to stay at home
and raise this child with Barbara

41
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,680
while you go cowboying off
all the time?

42
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,920
It won't always be like this.

43
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,040
- After reunification...
- Nothing will be different.

44
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,400
- Unless you stop being...
- Me?

45
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,240
Hey, Jim.

46
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,400
I have to go. We'll talk after.

47
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,480
If there is an after.

48
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,680
Oswald, where the hell is Nygma?

49
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,360
Shouldn't we have left the city
already?

50
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,680
Miss Kean,
this may come as a surprise,

51
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,120
but building a submarine
from scratch by yourself takes time.

52
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,080
- Patience.
- Easy for you to say.

53
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,080
You're not a walking egg timer.

54
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,720
Tell him to get a move on.

55
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,280
And why exactly are you hosting
Gordon's gangland get-together?

56
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,680
Keep your friends close
and your enemies closer, my dear.

57
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,120
If we're really going to leave
Gotham, we need to keep Gordon happy.

58
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,960
You know all about that, don't ya?

59
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,040
It was a momentary slip.

60
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,280
The world was on fire.

61
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,120
Jim, it's your show.

62
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,960
<i>Mi casa, su casa.</i>

63
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,520
I'll make this short.

64
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,440
Gotham is running dry.

65
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,800
Our supply of clean water
will only last a few more months.

66
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,800
So you have a choice.

67
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,080
You can keep killing each other,

68
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,520
fighting over
what little water's left.

69
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,600
Maybe eke out a few more months,
then die.

70
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,280
Or...

71
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,600
we can all agree, right now,
to an immediate cease-fire.

72
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,480
Government will not annex a war zone.

73
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,960
If we can show them that we deserve
to rejoin the mainland,

74
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,680
supply chain will be restored

75
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,200
and we will all survive
until reunification.

76
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,640
That's the choice.

77
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,960
Life or death.

78
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,720
Your call.

79
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,160
This is, no way.

80
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,240
Do we?

81
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,600
Yeah?

82
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,040
- All right.
- All right.

83
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,280
Weapons down! Get back!

84
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,160
Jim. You see where the shooter was?

85
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,840
Jim?

86
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,600
Oh, my God.

87
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,840
Get back!

88
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,040
You're gonna be all right.

89
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,960
It's bad. We gotta move him. Now.

90
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,240
Clinic's too far.

91
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,080
M.E.'s office.
Alvarez, come on, help.

92
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,160
On it.

93
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,440
On my count. One, two...

94
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,800
All right, get back.

95
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,880
Did not see that coming.

96
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,760
{\an5}What made you choose this of all
places for a scavenging mission?

97
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,640
{\an5}Just trust me, okay?

98
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,200
{\an5}What the hell?

99
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,840
{\an5}Sit.

100
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,040
{\an5}Wow.

101
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,760
Candles.

102
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,000
{\an5}If I didn't know any better,
I'd say this was a date.

103
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,920
{\an5}Maybe it is.

104
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,800
That okay with you?

105
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,720
{\an5}Maybe.

106
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,280
{\an5}Good.

107
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,240
So, let's eat.

108
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,680
Lee!

109
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,120
It's Jim, he's lost a lot of blood.
Can you save him?

110
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,720
Come with me.

111
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,720
Doc says he's gonna be okay.

112
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,080
He's gonna pull through.

113
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,440
But until then, I'm acting Captain!

114
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,960
Now the gangs in this city

115
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,440
think this is their time,
that they can run wild!

116
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,280
They are dead wrong!

117
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,680
I want us to take to the streets.
It is show of force time!

118
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,760
We ain't gonna give 'em an inch.

119
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,160
Harper, I want you to organize
patrol teams.

120
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,240
What're you gonna do?

121
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,600
I'm gonna find out
who shot my partner.

122
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,000
The bullet shattered against a rib.

123
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,640
I have to get all the fragments out.

124
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,600
I haven't done general surgery
since med school.

125
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,040
There.

126
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,200
All right, there's an exit wound
so the rest must've gone through.

127
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I need to sew him up.
Can you get me my kit?

128
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,080
Right away.

129
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,280
Come on, Jim.

130
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,120
You can do this. You have to fight.

131
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,040
You hear me?

132
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,920
You have to fight.

133
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,960
Order in the court.

134
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,680
James Gordon,

135
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:46,440
you have been brought here
to be judged for your many crimes,

136
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,120
and your very life hangs
in the balance.

137
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,840
- Do you understand?
- No, I...

138
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:57,400
The defendant understands
and waives his right to appeal.

139
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:03,600
The trial of James Gordon
will now begin.

140
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,920
No! Wait!

141
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,800
That was the best-canned meal
I've ever had.

142
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,320
And if this was a date,
I don't know how you're gonna top it

143
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,840
when everything gets back to normal.

144
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,000
I don't think things
are ever gonna be normal.

145
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
For me anyways.

146
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,400
What do you mean?

147
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,840
Wayne Manor's gone.

148
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,320
And I know that lot of people
lost a lot more,

149
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,280
but part of me wonders
if it wasn't fate.

150
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,960
It wasn't. It was Jeremiah
blowing up your house.

151
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,680
Maybe it's time to move on.

152
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,600
You mean like, leave Gotham?

153
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,720
Bruce, forget Wayne Manor.
This city is your home.

154
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,800
And how many terrible things
have happened to it because of me?

155
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,960
Galavan.

156
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,560
Ra's al Ghul.

157
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,920
If this city really is my home,

158
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,040
then maybe the best thing
I can do for it is leave.

159
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,680
I have to say...

160
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,520
kind of agree with you
on that one,

161
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,040
billionaire boy.

162
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,280
Jim Gordon's blood on my floor.

163
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,840
Olga!

164
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,680
Why is the help never around
when you need them?

165
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,200
This could be good for us.
You especially.

166
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,080
Are you serious?

167
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,080
Your baby daddy
is the top cop in Gotham.

168
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,440
A dead Jim Gordon is the only way

169
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,080
you can hold on
to your little bundle of joy.

170
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,280
Harvey, how is our dear...

171
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,280
Who the hell did it?
If I find out it was you,

172
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,400
- I swear to God...
- It wasn't me!

173
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,080
I merely supplied the venue!
At your boss's request!

174
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,720
- That doesn't mean squat!
- Fine.

175
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,080
You want to know who's to blame?
James Gordon!

176
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,160
He invited every criminal in Gotham.

177
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,200
What did he think
was going to happen?

178
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,840
How about you? Huh?

179
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,600
When did you two become
so buddy-buddy?

180
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,000
Maybe when you hatched up a plan

181
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,200
so you can keep that baby
for yourself.

182
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,680
Harvey, whatever you think of me,

183
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,480
I did not plot
to kill my child's father.

184
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,040
Well, someone here did!

185
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,600
Someone in this room shot Jim Gordon

186
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,840
and I'm not leaving
till I find out who it was!

187
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,320
Wrong!

188
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,200
The shooter was not here.

189
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,320
Look at the window, stupid!
The shot came from outside!

190
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,600
If the shooter was there

191
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,440
and the trajectory was here,
Jim was...

192
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,560
then the bullet...

193
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,360
I'm gonna find out who this was

194
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,080
and when I do there's gonna be
hell to pay.

195
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,240
Harvey...

196
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,520
is there anything I can do?

197
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,440
Yeah, you can keep the gangs
from tearing the city apart.

198
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,240
What do you want?

199
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,800
You, I will deal with later.

200
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,400
I'm here...

201
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,840
for you.

202
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,960
I need you to come with me.

203
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,640
Why would I do that?

204
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,800
Because you love me so much.

205
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,960
Well, not yet, but you will.

206
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,240
- Don't mess with him, Ivy.
- Protecting your boyfriend?

207
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,440
That's cute.

208
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,320
But I thought that might happen,
so I brought a friend.

209
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,520
I stumbled across this charming man
on the way over here.

210
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,320
And apparently
you two know each other.

211
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,640
Leave her out of this!

212
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,200
You know, I heard you talking about
the future of Gotham.

213
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,560
But Gotham will be what I decide.

214
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,160
A green world.

215
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,320
Won't that be beautiful?

216
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,960
Gorgeous.

217
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,560
Bruce and I have to go.

218
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,360
You always did think
you were better than me.

219
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,960
But without my plants,
you never would've left your bed.

220
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,480
I made you strong again.

221
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,320
Think about that while my friend
is cutting out your heart.

222
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,040
There are so many things
I wish I could say to you.

223
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,680
So many things I wish we could do.

224
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,040
This can't be the end.

225
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,080
Come on, Jim.

226
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,200
Talk to me.

227
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,280
Say something.

228
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,520
Speak.

229
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,400
No.

230
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,680
This isn't right!
I shouldn't be here!

231
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,880
- You have to listen to me.
- Silence. Silence.

232
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,920
The prosecution will now give
its opening remarks.

233
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,320
Your honor, Jim Gordon's crimes
are a matter of public record.

234
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,960
He's failed Gotham at every turn.

235
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,600
He failed to clean up the city...

236
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,840
failed to stop the bridges
from being destroyed,

237
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,120
failed to protect those poor,
innocent souls

238
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:06,360
in the refuge he himself created,
Haven.

239
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,360
I tried.

240
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,240
- I did the best...
- Silence!

241
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,960
One more outburst
and you will be held in contempt.

242
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,920
I'm hurt.

243
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,480
I need help, please.

244
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,560
Continue.

245
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,760
The issue here

246
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,520
is not how many people have died
because of Jim Gordon.

247
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,520
But how many more must die in order
to satisfy his need to be a hero.

248
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:41,000
Therefore we pose one simple
question.

249
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,400
Are the people in Jim Gordon's life

250
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,440
better off with him alive or dead?

251
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,480
I think I'm dying.

252
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,480
Prosecution would like to call
its first witness, your honor.

253
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,920
Doctor Lee Thompkins.

254
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,720
Come on, Jim. Hold on.

255
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,200
- How is he?
- Touch and go.

256
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,120
He's stable for now.

257
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,640
I removed all the bullet fragments.
But something keeps pulling him down.

258
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,720
Where are the fragments?

259
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,520
What is it?

260
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,240
VZ?

261
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,880
Victor Zsasz.

262
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,040
Okey-dokey.

263
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,920
Time to boogie.

264
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,240
Hey, I'm only here for Gordon.

265
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,680
So all of you stay down.

266
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,680
I see anyone, and, you know...

267
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,640
- bang.
- Oi, oi!

268
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,440
Now, I heard you were looking
for Jim Gordon.

269
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,440
Listen, I know we have history,

270
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,760
let's just let bygones be bygones.

271
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,840
Yeah, right.

272
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,200
- You did this to my face.
- Whatever.

273
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,200
It's not like you were much
of a looker before anyway.

274
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,760
Ivy says you hurt her feelings.
Why would you do that?

275
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,720
She's so sweet.

276
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,240
Ivy didn't make me strong.
I made me strong.

277
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,800
Tell me where she took Bruce.

278
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,200
The only reason
I'm not ending you right now

279
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,720
is the thought
of the look on your face

280
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,560
when Jim Gordon walks
through that door.

281
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,800
Because he's alive,
you son of a bitch!

282
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,080
What did you eat?
You smell like a butcher.

283
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,840
You know I'm vegan now.

284
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Why kill Jim now?

285
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,760
Makes no sense.
He saved your miserable ass.

286
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,920
He prevented Penguin
from executing you.

287
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,200
If anyone, you should be going
after Cobblepot.

288
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,960
Yeah. That's a good point.

289
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,760
Maybe I'll do him next.

290
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,520
It's kinda not up to me.

291
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,960
You're working for someone?

292
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,160
Sorry.

293
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,440
I want a name!

294
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,840
What's in a name?

295
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,960
A rose by any other name
would smell as sweet.

296
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,680
You know, I'm really taking the time

297
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,640
to stop and smell the roses
these days.

298
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,120
Like actual roses.

299
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,640
They're great.

300
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,480
- Are you high?
- On love.

301
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,240
But, like I said...

302
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,800
my lips are sealed.

303
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,200
Ivy Pepper.

304
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,080
You said it, not me.

305
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,840
I'm technically not allowed to
say it. Her name.

306
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,120
Which is such a bummer because it's
the most beautiful name in the world.

307
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,040
- You watch him.
- I could say it all day.

308
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,200
Yeah, I will say it all day.

309
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,080
Ivy, Ivy Pepper.

310
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:27,680
This is Ivy Pepper's ass.
Oh, it sounds good.

311
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,720
Here you are, Ms. Thompkins,
carefully. It'll be hot.

312
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,160
Forgive me, but I heard
on the grapevine

313
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,120
that you and Captain Gordon had a
rather heated exchange this morning.

314
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,160
Oh, God.

315
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,240
Was it that bad?

316
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,960
Apparently, it was like a session
of the Italian parliament.

317
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,880
You have misgivings about the arrival
of this child, don't you?

318
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,360
What am I getting myself into,
Alfred?

319
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,200
How am I supposed to raise a child

320
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,520
alongside a psychopath
like Barbara Kean?

321
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,480
I mean, how the hell
is this gonna work?

322
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,520
But that's not all of it.

323
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,440
If Jim and I are gonna do this,
then we have to do it together.

324
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,520
You know how he is.

325
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,400
I don't know what's going on inside
that man's head sometimes.

326
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,920
I think you'll find that he needs you
a lot more than he's letting on.

327
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,720
Well, I need to hear it from him.

328
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,800
I never thought that this was
how my life was gonna be.

329
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,000
I had no interest in being a father
myself.

330
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,920
I always presumed
that I was unfit to be one.

331
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,000
But then I found myself

332
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,000
one night, staring down an alley
at this little boy,

333
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,440
quite literally shaking with fear.

334
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,840
I don't know, it's funny
then what throws at you.

335
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,960
I'm keenly aware that I am not
Master Bruce's flesh and blood.

336
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,600
But it's the moments.

337
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,760
The little things like,

338
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,200
like when he uses a skill
that I once taught him

339
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,680
or we laugh at a joke
that only he and I share.

340
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,960
Those have been some of the most
ecstatic moments of my life.

341
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,160
Nothing can possibly prepare you
for that joy.

342
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,240
The how's and the what's,

343
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,600
you'll figure that stuff out.

344
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,400
What matters is this,
you'll be an exquisite mother.

345
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:38,160
And that child, he or she,
will be extraordinary...

346
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,120
because of you.

347
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,240
Thank you, Alfred.

348
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,480
Jim. can you hear me?

349
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,480
I'm right here. Right next to you.

350
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,200
Can you feel me?

351
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,000
Lee.

352
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,160
Doctor Lee Thompkins.

353
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,200
You've suffered at this man's hands,
more than anyone.

354
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,840
Broken heart.

355
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,400
Broken engagement.

356
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,200
A lost child.

357
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,360
And yet you're still with him.

358
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,440
I love him.

359
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,480
For all the pain he's caused you.

360
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:41,560
Would your life have be better,
could it not still be better,

361
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,840
without Jim Gordon?

362
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,680
- Answer the question.
- Lee...

363
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,080
I'll ask you in a different way.

364
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,760
Would you, Doctor Lee Thompkins,

365
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,640
be better off
if Jim Gordon were dead?

366
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,080
I'm sorry.

367
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,440
Everything he touches dies.

368
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,360
The prosecution rests, your honor.

369
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,720
You made her say that.

370
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,880
I didn't make her say anything.

371
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,960
Ask them.

372
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,680
Who are they?

373
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,600
More people who trusted you.

374
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,800
Who believed you when you said
you would protect them.

375
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,120
They're from Haven.

376
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,200
I think I'm dying.

377
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,600
And isn't it about time.

378
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,120
The verdict's in.

379
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,640
You're guilty.

380
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,600
Hey, Jeff. Listen to me.

381
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,280
One day you're gonna meet someone
who's gonna totally change your life,

382
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,120
and it's gonna make you happy.

383
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,240
And you deserve it.

384
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,520
Or not.

385
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,080
Is she here? She's here, isn't she?

386
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,200
Sweetie...

387
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,600
all I asked of you

388
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,280
was to kill Jim Gordon.

389
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,560
You're not angry, are you?

390
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,840
Cause I'll do it.
I'll do it right now.

391
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,160
I'll do it.

392
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,600
You keep the cops busy.

393
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,200
Luckily, the other part of my plan
is coming together nicely.

394
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,080
Lucius!

395
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,840
Bruce, I had no idea
you were stopping by.

396
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,880
I wanted to check on your progress.

397
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,200
Well, the toxicity levels
in this river continue to drop.

398
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:09,400
At this point, we'll be under the
threshold mandated by the government

399
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,640
sooner than expected.
It's not glamorous work,

400
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,880
but we are helping to save the lives
of thousands of people.

401
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,960
People...

402
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,240
I'm sorry, did you just say,
"People, ugh"?

403
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,520
Lucius, what if I were to tell you
I have in my possession

404
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,040
the most intoxicating perfume
you'll ever smell?

405
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,840
I would tell you
that is an abrupt change of topic.

406
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,920
Can we go back to the part
where you said, "People, ugh"?

407
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,160
Oh, my goodness.

408
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,640
Lucius, Ivy sent me here
to get you to shut down the plant.

409
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,840
Can you do that for her?

410
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,640
For Ivy?

411
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,640
Anything.

412
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,120
She is so great.

413
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,320
Raise your glasses.

414
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,560
I called you all here because
Jim Gordon is at death's door.

415
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:21,160
For years, he has hounded us,
beaten us, shot us.

416
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,280
And today he got his due.

417
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,600
To Jim Gordon, may he rot in hell.

418
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,920
What exactly are you doing?

419
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,120
I'm trying to keep this city
from ripping itself apart.

420
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,760
So this has nothing to do
with your feelings for Jim?

421
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,200
What if Ed fails?
And we're stuck here?

422
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,200
This will put us in Gordon's
good graces.

423
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,600
Consider it a backup plan.

424
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,120
Listen up.

425
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,360
Now to the real reason
I brought you all here.

426
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,240
I want you to agree
to an immediate truce.

427
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,680
Get out of here.

428
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,000
And what if, instead,
we shoot you and take your club?

429
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,640
I don't think so.

430
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,200
See, those drinks I just gave you?

431
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,280
They're poisoned.

432
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:15,280
And you had two shots
before everyone got here.

433
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,880
So that should be taking
effect around...

434
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,760
Now!

435
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,880
The rest of you have
forty-eight hours

436
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,000
before you'll need the antidote.

437
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:34,000
Which I will deliver to you, provided
you go back to your territories,

438
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,480
play nice, and send me all your guns.
Deal?

439
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,360
I said deal?

440
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,760
Now get out of here.

441
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,800
All right.

442
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,240
Jim would be so pleased.

443
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,440
Keep your friends close
and your enemies closer.

444
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,240
Isn't it right? Pengie?

445
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,920
Once I reverse the system,

446
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,400
all the toxin we've pulled
from the river will be re-released,

447
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,440
and the overload
should destroy the filters.

448
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:22,080
In a matter of minutes the
entire facility will be inoperable.

449
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,040
Perfect.

450
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,440
Ivy's gonna be so happy.

451
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,520
You think so?

452
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,480
<i>Security breach.</i>

453
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,560
<i>Zone one.</i>

454
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,480
That's odd.

455
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,280
Selina.

456
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,800
I'll take care of it.

457
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,600
Okay.

458
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,280
All right, listen up!

459
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,880
I know you're probably familiar
with Ivy Pepper,

460
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,000
in fact, you were probably here
when she hypnotized

461
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,320
the whole freaking precinct.

462
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,960
Okay? She is on the loose

463
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,600
and we've gotta find her
and take her down.

464
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,400
Actually, fellas, she's already here.

465
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,120
That's right. Ivy came to free me.

466
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,640
That is true love for you.

467
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,760
She really understands
what makes me tick.

468
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,120
Don't worry, though.

469
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,600
I'm just a distraction so she can
finish off Jim once and for all.

470
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,280
You know, that's how
great couples work.

471
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,560
Maybe I shouldn't have told you that.

472
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,320
Oh, well.

473
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,520
- I'm sorry, Miss Thompkins.
- I know. Go.

474
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,600
Thank you, Alfred.

475
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,200
Come on, Jim. Can you hear me?

476
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Stay with me.

477
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,840
Stay with me, Jim.

478
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,080
Jim.

479
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,120
Want a drink?
Alvarez makes a hell of a Mai Tai.

480
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,520
I can barely feel my face.

481
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,120
Harvey? What is this?

482
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,960
It's your wake.

483
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,040
Pretty nice turnout, huh?

484
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:23,600
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

485
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:26,360
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

486
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:29,960
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

487
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,240
<i>Which nobody can deny</i>

488
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,680
Wake?

489
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,240
I'm not dead yet.

490
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,280
Well, be a little bit of a bummer
to have it after you died.

491
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,360
Don't you think?

492
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,400
I'm gonna have a kid, Harvey.

493
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,680
How do I protect that child
when everything around me dies?

494
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,200
Harvey?

495
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,800
That's a good question.

496
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,120
Will.

497
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,400
You said I'd be safe in Haven.

498
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,560
I trusted you.

499
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,480
I know. I did my best.

500
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,080
Your best never seems good enough.

501
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,160
It's time to go.

502
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,960
No, no, no. Jim.

503
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,360
Where's my adrenaline?

504
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,600
Oh, looks like Victor succeeded
after all.

505
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,880
I guess I'll have to settle
for killing you.

506
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,520
I can tell you one thing, I am sick

507
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,800
and tired of getting shot
at in my own precinct.

508
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,880
Bullock, what the bloody hell
is going on?

509
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,440
I thought you had this lunatic
locked up?

510
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,360
Ivy broke him out
and gave him arsenal.

511
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,840
But I have an idea. I gotta get
to the storeroom. Give me cover.

512
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,920
Alvarez, go.

513
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,360
Why are you doing this?

514
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,600
What has Jim ever done to you?

515
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,680
Gotham has a chance to be born anew.

516
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,320
To return to what it was

517
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:33,080
before people ripped down the trees
and paved over the earth.

518
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:36,040
He's trying to re-unify with the
mainland to save all these people.

519
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,120
A return to filth.

520
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,760
Pollution.

521
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,960
He's fighting for death.

522
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,720
While I promise life.

523
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,080
In its purest form.

524
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:53,480
Is that your plan to have the plants
take over Gotham? By killing Jim?

525
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,160
Oh, killing Gordon's
just the first part.

526
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,200
Bruce Wayne is taking care
of the rest.

527
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,080
For what it's worth, I am sorry.

528
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,160
For what?

529
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,040
This pain is nothing compared
to what you are about to feel.

530
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,560
- Say goodbye to Jim Gordon for me.
- No!

531
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,640
No, no, no.

532
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,400
No!

533
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,560
Jim.

534
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,720
Selina, you're wasting your time.

535
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,640
Bruce. You have to snap out
of Ivy's spell. This is not you.

536
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,840
You're wrong.
Ivy's given me a purpose.

537
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,880
Stop! Stop, I don't wanna fight you!

538
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:45,480
What're you gonna do?
Kill everything in Gotham?

539
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,080
The toxins will only kill
all the people.

540
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,440
The plants will adapt.
They always do.

541
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,880
- Can you hear what that sounds like?
- Yeah. It sounds great!

542
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,880
I guess I shouldn't be surprised.

543
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,040
You don't care about Gotham.
You were gonna leave anyway.

544
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,920
What about the rest of us, huh?

545
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,840
The ones who're gonna be stuck here
without you!

546
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,920
Selina.

547
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,680
Selina. I'm okay.

548
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,240
- Bruce, I'm so sorry.
- We need to stop Lucius. Come on.

549
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,320
Okay.

550
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,560
Lucius!
You have to stop the shutdown.

551
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:36,920
Oh no. I can't do that.
Ivy would be so mad.

552
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,080
Listen to me, I used Ivy's perfume
to hypnotize you.

553
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,160
She's using you.

554
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:42,720
No.

555
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,240
Ivy would never do that.

556
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,440
We're perfectly bonded.

557
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:51,320
Like carbon and oxygen,
or hydrogen and oxygen.

558
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,960
- We do not have time for this.
- I'm sorry.

559
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,440
- There.
- Oh, you kicked me in the head.

560
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,240
I didn't have a choice, Lucius.
Bruce, where's Ivy?

561
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,160
She was headed to the GCPD.

562
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,560
I wonder what Ivy's doing right now.

563
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,400
Hey, lover boy!

564
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,560
- Are you serious right now?
- As a heart attack.

565
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,080
What an idiot.

566
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,040
Oh, my...

567
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,160
Oh, that felt good.

568
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,200
Come on, Jim! You fight
for everyone else. You never give up.

569
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,000
Fight for yourself, Jim! Come on!

570
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,800
It's time.

571
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,120
Jim.

572
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,360
Lee?

573
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,520
Is that...

574
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,200
Yes.

575
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,440
Do you wanna...

576
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,240
I don't know.

577
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,480
I don't know that I can.

578
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,280
Oh, I see.

579
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,920
- No!
- Goodbye, Jim.

580
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,400
No! I want to live!

581
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,920
- I want to live!
- It's too late.

582
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,480
No, Will, no!

583
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,200
- Lee.
- Don't move.

584
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,280
Don't move.

585
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,800
How you feel?

586
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,320
Like I almost died.

587
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,360
But you didn't.

588
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,880
- You fought. You came back to me.
- Because I need you.

589
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:47,600
- Lee, this child...
- It's okay.

590
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,040
It's okay to be scared.

591
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,480
Only thing scarier than doing this
is doing it without you.

592
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,640
Can I ask you something?

593
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,840
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

594
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,880
He seems nervous.

595
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,800
I know.

596
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,960
He should be thrilled.

597
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,360
Marrying a woman who's smarter
and better looking than him.

598
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,480
Selina, while we were fighting,

599
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,280
when I was hypnotized,
you talked about me leaving Gotham...

600
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,360
Quiet.

601
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,160
Here she comes.

602
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,640
You may sit.

603
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:25,080
I'm just gonna say, this isn't gonna
be some long, drawn-out

604
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,120
tearful affair like you
all are used to. Okay?

605
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,200
Yeah, this is gonna be
a short wedding.

606
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:31,520
I'm gonna try and make it quick
so we can all get to the bar.

607
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,600
Okay?

608
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,520
I first met a young Jim Gordon
when he was a,

609
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:41,960
pain-in-the-ass
moralistic rookie detective.

610
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,040
In the years since,
he's evolved into a

611
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,200
pain-in-the-ass moralistic Captain.

612
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,560
I'd say he's my best friend,

613
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,960
but in truth, he's my only friend...

614
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,960
so we'll skip that.

615
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,120
Onto Lee.

616
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,280
Lee's always had his back.

617
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,280
Except for that time
when she was infected

618
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:10,640
with the crazy-making virus,
and she tried to kill him.

619
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,720
But that's love.

620
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,280
But I will say,

621
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,240
if there's one beautiful thing
that's happened

622
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:20,440
over these last few crazy years,

623
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:23,520
it's that these two people
met each other.

624
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,560
And that truly is a beautiful thing.

625
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,640
Jim, will you please take Lee's hand?

626
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,280
Do you, Jim Gordon,
take Lee Thompkins to be

627
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,720
your lawfully wedded wife,
to have and to hold,

628
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,600
from this day forward,
for better, for worse,

629
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,480
for richer, for poorer,

630
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,760
in sickness and in health,

631
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,760
to love and cherish
till death do you part?

632
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,200
I do.

633
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,720
And you, Lee Thompkins?
Do you do the same?

634
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,160
Sure, Harvey.

635
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,720
I do.

636
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,240
By the power vested in me

637
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,880
by absolutely no one...

638
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:21,760
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

639
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,200
What?

640
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:12,000
And now Jim Gordon
and Lee Thompkins are man and wife.

641
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:16,360
Thank God, you held the city together

642
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:19,240
so that this blessed event
could take place.

643
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,520
It was never gonna work.

644
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,720
- What?
- Controlling the gangs

645
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,280
was not a backup plan.

646
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:34,840
You saw a chance to convince
James Gordon that you had changed.

647
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,280
But he will never see you as anything

648
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:42,600
but a dangerous woman
keeping his child from him.

649
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:47,000
Then I'd best be long gone
before he can do anything about it.

650
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,320
He will hunt you
to the ends of the earth.

651
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,480
Let him.
