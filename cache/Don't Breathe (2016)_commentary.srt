00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,804
Hey, I'm Fede Alvarez. I'm the
director and the writer of this film.

2
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:26,849
Hello, this is Rodo Sayagues.
I'm the writer.

3
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:31,692
And this is Stephen Lang,
and I play the Blind Man in this film.

4
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:35,608
And we've gathered to
a screening of the film...

5
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:37,868
...with our commentary.

6
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,904
It's a bunch of logos.

7
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:44,451
But there's definitely something
that I think it's...

8
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:48,087
It's the only interesting part
about the logos, is we always...

9
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:51,591
We start... The movie starts right away...
Like the soundtrack...

10
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,298
That eerie soundtrack starts on the first
image of the movie, there's no...

11
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,713
That's hopefully when the audience
gets hooked...

12
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:01,179
...and we never really let them go
until the end.

13
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:07,724
Detroit.

14
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:13,939
And there you are, Slang.

15
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:15,823
-I know.
-Dragging that poor girl...

16
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:18,234
...down the street for real. Ha, ha.

17
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:21,279
-That was a... That was a day.
-Ha, ha.

18
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,038
She was a...

19
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,449
She's... She's a... You know...

20
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:28,085
She doesn't look like she's too big...

21
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:31,623
...but she got real heavy
that day, somehow. Heh, heh.

22
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,713
Well, we did this shot I think
two or three times.

23
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:38,800
And... And I demanded
you do all the dragging.

24
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:41,716
There was no help.
It was just you, all muscle...

25
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:44,134
...dragging her like three times
down the street.

26
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:47,146
-Right.
-And this one is the third shot.

27
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:50,900
And I remember at the end of this one
you were like, "Okay. Hope you got it."

28
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,273
Oh, that's a beauty.

29
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:57,197
-You got it good.
-Yeah.

30
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:02,119
It works pretty well, like, the whole...
You think you're...

31
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,163
You're in just suburban America.

32
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:08,201
And bit by bit, as you get closer
to the characters...

33
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:10,244
...you realize there's a lot more.

34
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:12,038
-You know?
-Totally.

35
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,705
You see it.

36
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:14,999
Don't Breathe.

37
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:18,260
I've come to really like the title
of this film.

38
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,263
Cool. It used to be called
Man in the Dark.

39
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:24,642
Well, I was... At the time I was
so wedded to that title.

40
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:25,892
Me, too.

41
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,846
-...17...
-Yo, kill that already.

42
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:30,765
Rodo and I, we loved Man in the Dark...

43
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:35,857
...because it's the name that we stamped
on the script when we finished it.

44
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:38,064
But we got to love Don't Breathe as well.

45
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:41,484
Yeah. Actually I think it changed names
more than twice.

46
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:43,244
-Really?
-Yeah.

47
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:46,280
-What were the other titles?
-There were a lot of them.

48
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,618
Don't Breathe in the Dark.
The Blind Man was something...

49
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:54,380
...that we actually were very keen
to title at some point.

50
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,335
-Just Blind Man.
-Uh-huh.

51
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:02,679
Oh!

52
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:05,299
I just... I love Danny's character,
you know...

53
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:09,562
-...just sort of the cavalier nature of it.
-Yeah.

54
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:10,846
He's swag.

55
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:15,643
So most of the movie was shot in...

56
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:19,655
We did Detroit, and we did Budapest.
And this is actually...

57
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:24,069
Actually in Budapest, like a house
outside a city.

58
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:27,364
Yeah, I think it's the only location stuff
we did in the city.

59
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,953
Then the rest in Budapest
was all inside a studio.

60
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:32,334
Except remember, we did shoot
the train station.

61
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:33,710
True. The train station.

62
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,541
-Which I thought was just great.
-I loved that.

63
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:40,131
Yeah, it used to be
an old airport, I think.

64
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:44,968
But here we're definitely in Detroit. Back
flying with the drone around the city.

65
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:49,306
How many days did we shoot in Detroit?

66
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:53,598
We spent like a week there.
But we shot like a couple days, I guess.

67
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:57,518
And this was an entire day of just,
you know...

68
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,528
Is that ladybug real?

69
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:02,030
-Yes, it is. Heh, heh.
-Did you get...

70
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,032
Did you have like a lady bug wrangler...

71
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:05,863
-...when you were doing that?
-We did.

72
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,119
We had an animal wrangler
that took care of...

73
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:12,204
From, you know... From everything...
From the dogs to the ladybug.

74
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:16,962
But that's one of the strange things of
filmmaking that, of course everybody...

75
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:18,418
When...

76
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:23,302
When the page says ladybug, everybody
goes for CG ladybug right away.

77
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:27,010
And I didn't want to use CG, ha, ha,
if I could help it...

78
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:29,767
...because it's a movie that
doesn't need it or have it.

79
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:33,895
So to just have suddenly a CG ladybug
could have been a problem.

80
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:37,478
And we really went for it,
and we had a couple of them.

81
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:42,692
It was very, very hot, so ladybugs
don't survive under extreme heat.

82
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:47,155
So you cannot... You actually can't
put the disclaimer that no ladybugs...

83
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,366
-...were harmed.
-None of them were harmed...

84
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,156
...it was just the fact that
we couldn't find them...

85
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:55,452
...and some of them just died
before they arrived on set.

86
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:58,621
But, yeah, we ended up doing it
with a real ladybug.

87
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:01,211
-We laugh now about this.
-Heh, heh.

88
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,500
We'll hear about it.

89
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,341
This is Detroit.

90
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:08,097
The family of Alex.

91
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:11,054
Actually, you were saying there's no...

92
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:12,718
There's no CGI in this.

93
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:16,355
And we never... I don't recall
any green screen either.

94
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:18,391
-Did we?
-No. No, no, no.

95
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:21,731
-That's a rarity these days, my friend.
-Yeah.

96
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:25,148
But I guess... You know, I like when...
If you can pull it off...

97
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,737
...I think it's good, make it more classy.

98
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:30,778
But that was the whole approach
of this movie, since day one...

99
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:34,950
...I was trying to do this, you know,
in a very classy way.

100
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:38,710
Not doing anything that was,
you know, top of the line...

101
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,793
...CG or visual effects,
because stuff like that gets old.

102
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:44,550
And a good story, I think,
will never get old.

103
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:51,341
Was this script inspired by any events
you read about in the paper?

104
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,304
I think it was life, right?

105
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:58,599
Rodo and I were actually driving back
from San Diego one day and thought...

106
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:01,604
We kind of created the character
of the Blind Man.

107
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:05,066
And all the story kind of
came out of that.

108
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,652
But... Yeah, but there
were stories, right?

109
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:11,069
Yeah, with that case,
I remember exactly where it happened.

110
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:15,456
This guy that kept a girl
in a basement...

111
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,081
...for many, many years.

112
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:20,995
Yeah, there was one in Switzerland,
I think ages ago.

113
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,004
Unfortunately, there's been many others.

114
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:26,792
And probably there's others we don't
know about. Those are the scary ones...

115
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,132
-...the ones that are ongoing.
-So we thought what if burglars...

116
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:31,263
-...break into that guy's house?
-Right.

117
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:34,391
And find this... This...

118
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,514
Crime going on.

119
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:39,726
So we thought that would be cool.

120
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:44,102
Which is kind of the fun of this movie,
like, nobody is good.

121
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:47,943
So you were in the car and you just sort
of spun the story out to each other?

122
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:50,027
-Yeah, I guess so.
-Something like that, yeah.

123
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:54,069
Something like that.
I mean, we knew that...

124
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,612
That we wanted to...

125
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,873
Because the whole girl in the cellar thing
kind of came later.

126
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:02,082
I think the first part of the idea was...

127
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:06,419
...to tell the story from
the point of view of robbers.

128
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:09,301
Because it's something that you
don't see often and...

129
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:11,838
And as far as real life goes...

130
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:16,680
...like, house robbers,
they do have scary and...

131
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:20,433
And very particular adventures every day.
Regardless of the judgment...

132
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:24,191
...of what they're doing, whether it's
a bad thing, at the end of the day...

133
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:27,103
...they're kids that enter a house,
and try to get away with things...

134
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,567
...and they might get shot,
and might get killed.

135
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,698
And that happens every day.

136
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:35,862
And it's kind of a strange world
that we don't really see often in movies.

137
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:39,873
This kind of down and dirty,
greedy group of kids...

138
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,831
...that are breaking into peoples' houses
and taking stuff.

139
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:46,959
And the challenge was obviously getting
the audience to care about them.

140
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:51,047
So that's why once we learn more about
what's going on in the house...

141
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:54,134
...it becomes that thing of
they might be bad but there's...

142
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:57,516
Perhaps there's even more evil stuff
happening inside the house.

143
00:07:57,686 --> 00:08:00,895
But at that point, I mean, that comes...

144
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:04,352
We've gone a substantial
way in the film...

145
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:06,267
...at that point and...

146
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,228
Before you turn everything on its ear.

147
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:13,695
Because to have these kids
be the perpetrators...

148
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:16,155
...and my character
essentially be a victim...

149
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:17,865
...you establish that.

150
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:22,408
-Yeah.
-And it works beautifully, I mean, then...

151
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:28,874
And then the way you just
kind of turn that on its ear...

152
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,508
-...Is pretty fascinating, I think.
-Heh, heh.

153
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:35,842
It's good to see how the audience
empathy switches...

154
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,677
...from one side to the other.

155
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:41,344
And kind of constantly does that
throughout the movie.

156
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,479
Which is really fascinating,
but it's just... There I am.

157
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:48,563
I don't know if you spot me there.
That was me in that newspaper.

158
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:52,105
-I was an illegal immigrant.
-Your Hitchcock moment.

159
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:55,695
It said something like, "Illegal immigrant
was blamed for two murders."

160
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:59,078
Something like that.
That's my face in there, blurred out.

161
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:03,323
This scene is all about that, right?
The empathy.

162
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,708
-Why she does what she's doing.
-Sure.

163
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,627
It's just a few months
till he can find a new job.

164
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:11,882
I remember
this scene used to be different.

165
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:14,051
She used to live with his father.

166
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,888
And his father was an abusive father...

167
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:20,265
-...a violent guy.
-Mm-hm.

168
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:24,144
But then we thought that
it would have been even better...

169
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:28,273
...if she lived with a mother,
just negligent.

170
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:32,983
And... And then we added that
character sitting next to her.

171
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,482
Doing nothing.
Just being very menacing.

172
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,946
Well, he's got a swastika
on his right hand.

173
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,283
-Yeah.
-So if it was not clear enough...

174
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:43,784
-Yeah.
-Right.

175
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:47,747
And she's such a sweet, you know...

176
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,038
-...charming little beauty.
-Yeah.

177
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:54,584
She doesn't do a lot in the movie,
but does everything she needs to do...

178
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:58,755
...just by being there, showing someone
that really represents innocence.

179
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:02,345
And in that environment, you know
that's not gonna last long.

180
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:07,480
And so we felt it was a good
clock ticking for her life.

181
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:10,767
Everything is a little bit extreme
in this scene...

182
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,855
...but I think it works.

183
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:17,023
We needed to set this up
in like two minutes.

184
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,611
-And I think it worked.
-It's...

185
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:22,198
I don't know... I don't know that
I would've called it extreme.

186
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,704
I think everything is on the nose...

187
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,490
-...but it kind of has to be.
-Yeah.

188
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:30,878
It's a way of delivering
exposition quickly.

189
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:34,415
Yeah, that's the thing with TV,
the difference between TV and films.

190
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:37,084
In TV, you have a lot of time to develop
these things.

191
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:39,674
And in this kind of movie,
you have to hit it hard...

192
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:43,967
...and you need the audience to get it
right away and have those few minutes...

193
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:46,306
-...to get a point across.
-Mm-hm.

194
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,095
I think it helped, I mean...

195
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:52,983
At least then from that point on,
the audience hopefully will understand...

196
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:57,272
...that it's very unlikely that she's
gonna back away from her goal...

197
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,689
...which is take the money
from the Blind Man.

198
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:03,077
And I think it's a really interesting
choice that you've made...

199
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:06,955
...because we're kind of approaching
the end of when we're gonna be outside.

200
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:11,335
And we have not encountered
one other person.

201
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,869
-Yeah. It's true.
-You know...

202
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,505
...no one on the streets at all.

203
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,884
It was kind of to give that
sense of desolation...

204
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:22,671
...that Detroit might have in places,
in particular this kind of neighborhood.

205
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:27,935
So, yeah, it's true that you don't really
see anybody else except for the characters.

206
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:31,267
Even when they're at the restaurant,
nobody's there. It's just that...

207
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:35,309
That sense of, "They have to get out.
They have to go to someplace else.”

208
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:37,436
- ;
- Is that a new tattoo?

209
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:38,695
Yeah.

210
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,026
I got it last night.

211
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,195
-Is it a...?
-Ladybug.

212
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,445
The ladybug again.

213
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:45,319
Of course, it's the...

214
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:50,287
I don't know what we thought. But I think
it was always representing that idea.

215
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,919
Kind of the freedom
that she's looking for...

216
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,453
...and she's desperate to get.

217
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:58,875
My mom started drinking
and she told me that...

218
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:00,128
Also, they're...

219
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:04,797
I've always associated them with luck.

220
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,466
Yeah. In the folklore I think it's...

221
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:10,636
Ladybug... You see a ladybug,
it's always a happy moment.

222
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,804
"Oh, look, a ladybug."
So it's good.

223
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:17,476
And, yeah, I think in Uruguay folklore
it's always something...

224
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:21,613
...that you associate with good fortune.
Which is not really coming her way now.

225
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:24,275
But I think eventually in the movie
it comes around...

226
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,910
...when she sees it
at the right moment.

227
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,499
I think this back story as well
used to be longer in the script, right?

228
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:34,034
Yeah.

229
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:36,294
When I reach California,
I'll color this tat...

230
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:39,297
...and that's the last time
I will mark my body.

231
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:41,625
Yeah, and this is
the last time in the movie...

232
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:43,134
...they will have a moment of peace.

233
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:47,218
I think from this point on
it's gonna be nonstop.

234
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:51,511
There used to be actually a shot here,
a short insert that...

235
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:56,398
That you'll find on the extras
of the DVD on the deleted scenes. But I...

236
00:12:56,567 --> 00:13:00,185
But I love it. You should check it out.
Which is when we get a glimpse...

237
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:02,445
...of what the Blind Man is doing.

238
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,198
Not right at this moment,
but right before this moment.

239
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:07,780
And we get to know that he's a gard...

240
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:09,490
-He does gardening.
-The gardening scene.

241
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:11,951
-Yeah, remember?
-I enjoyed the gardening scenes.

242
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,413
-Yeah.
-I saw the deleted scene.

243
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,918
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

244
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,713
Oh, that dog.

245
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,749
The dog...

246
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:26,045
-The dog gets an award. Ha, ha.
-Oh, yeah. Yeah.

247
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:29,052
Particularly for the one day
we were on set and we know...

248
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,762
...that he wasn't hitting his marks
all the time.

249
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:35,645
-Yeah.
-But in the movie he really, you know...

250
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,431
He does what he has to do.

251
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:40,942
He's very menacing and it's that
extension of the will of the Blind Man.

252
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:45,238
Yeah, I think the first draft that
we wrote didn't have the dog.

253
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:48,742
-Uh-uh.
-And... And I think it was Fede's idea...

254
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,619
...this guy should have a dog.
How come he doesn't have a dog?

255
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:54,281
-Right.
-The dog turned out to be one of the...

256
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:58,084
A really important element in the movie.

257
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:05,049
That's it. That's it for daytime.
Now we go into nighttime.

258
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,381
For good.

259
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,971
-I love this shot here.
-Mm.

260
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:16,310
It almost looks like they're in space.
Ha, ha.

261
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:18,392
There's something very strange about it.

262
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:22,981
I just read the silhouettes. It looks like
three cosmonauts somewhere.

263
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:25,236
In the middle of nowhere.

264
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:30,359
Which is what I love about that house,
that it's...

265
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:33,244
Usually in a scary movie...

266
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,997
...every time you wanna portray
the house as creepy...

267
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:40,707
...you have a bunch of nice houses and
you have a scary house in the middle.

268
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,293
And the one that is run down
and not well-kept, that's the scary one.

269
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:47,380
-Here it's the other way around.
-Kind of the opposite.

270
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:51,046
It's the house that is in good shape,
in a bad neighborhood.

271
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:55,343
And ends up for that reason
being the one that is unsettling.

272
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,852
-Now we're in studio here.
-Yeah.

273
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,012
-But...
-Just like that.

274
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,648
And the fact that the house
is well-maintained...

275
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:04,526
...that was an important thing
for my character.

276
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,936
It says an awful lot about the...

277
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:10,198
You know, the order
that he maintains in his life.

278
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:11,824
Yeah.

279
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,236
-That was CGI, right?
-That was CG.

280
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:15,950
Yeah. That was the only...

281
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:19,333
Well, not the only, I think there's a
couple of CG moments in the movie.

282
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:24,918
That's probably the fanciest CG effect
in the whole movie, ironically.

283
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:28,880
The piece of treat, of hot dog,
that is thrown to the dog.

284
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:32,091
It had to fly over the fence and land.

285
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,802
All that was done actually in Uruguay,
in our country.

286
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:36,341
Because the money's in there...

287
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,476
...and the paranoid fuck
doesn't trust nobody.

288
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,353
Let's check for a side door.

289
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:47,402
All this, like here,
I think this is the moment...

290
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:51,031
...when they cross that gate
is when the real tension starts.

291
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,693
And it's really what inspired
the whole movie, I guess...

292
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:59,331
...was that idea that there's something
very scary about...

293
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,740
...not just having people...

294
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:04,161
Seeing scenes about people breaking
into someone's house.

295
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:07,456
But even if you're with them,
and you're with the house breaker...

296
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,295
...it's always something very tense...

297
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,757
...because for us,
and I think for everybody...

298
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:16,214
...the private space
and the private property...

299
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:19,760
...is something that we value
so much in the idea that, you know...

300
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:22,178
...we feel safe inside our house
and there's a...

301
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,973
There's a common agreement in society...

302
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:27,768
...that you don't walk into
someone else's property.

303
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,435
And so when you see it happen...

304
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:33,949
...it's fascinating how we all
collectively, and in theaters...

305
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:37,361
...and everybody watching,
as soon as they cross that line...

306
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:40,155
...and they walk into a space
that is not theirs...

307
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:43,496
...it puts everybody
in a very, very tense mode.

308
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:47,708
And that's something that we knew. And
actually what started the conversation...

309
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,795
...when we started talking
about this movie.

310
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:53,630
When we were thinking about
what to write after Evil Dead.

311
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:57,342
And... And based on that feeling,
we thought:

312
00:16:57,517 --> 00:17:02,307
"Okay. What would be a story
that would take place in that space?

313
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:07,520
And that could have you on that edge
all the time."

314
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,526
And that's when we thought
about this group of kids...

315
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,063
...and who they were
gonna break into...

316
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:14,731
...and the character
of the Blind Man came out.

317
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:16,991
There's a bolt here. I can feel it.

318
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:20,366
And they're all in their own way...

319
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:25,410
-...extremely likable kids.
-Mm-hm.

320
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:29,454
I think... I mean you
kind of understand...

321
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:33,383
...where they're coming from...

322
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,043
...their needs and everything.

323
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:39,260
But when they go...
When they go over that fence...

324
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,219
...they kind of...

325
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,101
It's all bets are off, in a way.

326
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:46,013
They put themselves in a...

327
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:50,149
A morally indefensible position,
it seems to me.

328
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:51,976
It's, you know, so...

329
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:55,613
In other words, "Well, you're
gonna get what you deserve."

330
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,990
-Even though you like them.
-Yeah.

331
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,620
Yeah, that's what is strange
and fascinating about the film as well.

332
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:06,499
And so far, today, we're doing
this commentary...

333
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:08,751
...and the movie hasn't come out yet.

334
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:12,539
But so far just the reaction of the world
based on the trailers...

335
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:14,674
...and what the concept of the movie is...

336
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:17,962
...It's very interesting to see
how much debate it caused...

337
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:21,177
...based on what you said.
They're gonna get what they deserve.

338
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,842
And a lot of people see
the trailer and they go like:

339
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,603
"Well, they get what they deserve."
Now people say:

340
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:32,893
"Well, but the Blind Man was doing
his own things as well there."

341
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:36,938
But that doesn't mean it's legal for him
to chase them and kill them.

342
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,902
If you feel threatened,
and he definitely does.

343
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,659
Particularly because,
as we're gonna see now they...

344
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,411
They brought a gun into the house.

345
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:48,667
Which the Blind Man's not gonna...
Not gonna stop to argue with them...

346
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:52,329
...and ask them if they plan
to shoot him with that gun.

347
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,007
So that's why we think it makes for a...

348
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:59,340
For a very morally conflictive
story to see.

349
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:01,424
Which is the kind of story that we like.

350
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:05,843
We don't like to spoon-feed the audience
with the answer, the moral answer.

351
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:10,309
This sequence here is kind of classic...

352
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,648
...almost James Bond stuff.

353
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,560
You know... Ha, ha. You know
you have to kind of...

354
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:19,106
The clock is ticking down
before the bomb goes off.

355
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,820
Before the alarm goes off or whatever.

356
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,406
So it's a nice piece of suspense.

357
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,912
And here for me is one of the...

358
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,370
It's the first time that,
I think in the movie...

359
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:32,581
...when Pedro Luque, the DP,
starts showing off. Heh, heh.

360
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:35,247
-He's showing off big time here. Beautiful.
-I say that in a good way.

361
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:39,167
Because it's one of the most beautiful
shots. How the light from the street...

362
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:41,712
...hits her eyes as
she's realizing that...

363
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:45,052
...there's something in this house
that's more than what you think.

364
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:48,514
-This was a really interesting beat.
-I love that beat.

365
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:51,350
-The picture upside down.
-Upside down.

366
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:54,937
It really tells you that, yeah,
the guy is really, really blind for sure.

367
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:57,193
But it's also heartbreaking
in its way too.

368
00:19:57,363 --> 00:20:00,526
Because in some weird way,
it makes him vulnerable.

369
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,032
-Yeah.
-Yeah, you think, "Oh, he did that."

370
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,494
It also tells you
that he doesn't have many friends.

371
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:09,577
Like there's no people coming
to the house and telling him:

372
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,366
"You put that picture upside down.

373
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:12,700
You should fix that."

374
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,619
He's a very lonely man right now.

375
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:16,458
Right. Right.

376
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,713
Yeah, I found that shot,
when I saw the film, to be really moving.

377
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:26,760
Here, of course, is our long hero shot.

378
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:32,183
That's gonna... Basically the goal,
obviously, is to get from the start...

379
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:35,474
It's basically a shot that switches
points of view in the movie...

380
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:38,234
...and shows you the story
from their point of view.

381
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:42,773
And it's gonna end up
over the shoulder of the Blind Man.

382
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:48,616
Showing how scary it is for him to be
home-invaded without him knowing it.

383
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:53,040
Obviously, it's showing all the pieces
that are gonna play a part in the movie.

384
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,451
But, I mean, you know,
it's fascinating...

385
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:58,371
...because what you just
showed there was a tool room.

386
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:00,131
An orderly tool room.

387
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:04,590
And there's nothing intrinsically
threatening about that.

388
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,004
-Mm-hm. Yeah.
-You know?

389
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:09,425
I mean, it's tools that he's laid out
to do jobs around the house.

390
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:10,717
But the audience knows.

391
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:11,976
Of course, in context.

392
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:15,013
The audience can see the hammer.
We push into that like we did.

393
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:17,432
These are all pieces
that are gonna come back.

394
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:21,444
The bell, that is the alarm system
that the Blind Man has...

395
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:23,400
...for what's happening in the cellar.

396
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:26,908
-We're still in one shot here?
-It's one shot that starts at the door...

397
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:30,445
-Amazing.
-...and ends up upstairs.

398
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:36,744
Of course, we'll know that the money
is right somewhere there. Closet.

399
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,417
And the door to the cellar.

400
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:41,581
It's all the pieces.

401
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:44,342
Remember that we always
talked about this movie being...

402
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:47,630
...kind of a chess game
between these two parts.

403
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:51,516
So this is a moment
where we show kind of the rules...

404
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:54,143
...and who are the players.

405
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,224
What door is locked, what door is not.

406
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:58,639
-Right.
-Before the game starts.

407
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:01,981
Right. Stake out the terrain a little bit.

408
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,568
Also, here you start...

409
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:14,785
I think also this is the first time
that you start feeling Roque Banos.

410
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:18,918
A magnificent soundtrack
which is, like he said...

411
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:23,298
...the whole music
was actually done through...

412
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:24,923
...not classical instruments...

413
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:31,215
...but mostly pipes
and weird instruments that he found...

414
00:22:31,392 --> 00:22:36,683
...made by a guy in Tucson that created
his own instruments in his back yard...

415
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:38,893
...and called it an orchestra.

416
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:43,276
And in this whole shot,
we really get to enjoy that soundtrack.

417
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:49,236
And like Roque said, "It's like if the
house was singing this unsettling song."

418
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,026
Right.

419
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,829
And you get a glimpse of the daughter.

420
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:58,208
Which is curious. Of course the TV's
there, but he doesn't watch the TV.

421
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:02,245
So I thought it was interesting
to have it pointed in a strange way.

422
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:04,505
Not towards the bed.

423
00:23:04,675 --> 00:23:07,633
But he uses it just to fall asleep
to the sound of his daughter.

424
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:10,465
Sure, it provides the soundtrack
for his life, I think.

425
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:11,800
Yeah.

426
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:14,557
And it's like a lullaby for him.

427
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,013
Here we are.

428
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:21,397
Just like that, we switch point of view
and now we're with him.

429
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:24,733
As he's the main character
of his movie, right?

430
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:26,360
He's the hero of his movie.

431
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,942
He's just sleeping,
not bothering anybody...

432
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:32,108
...and there's a guy walking
into his room.

433
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:34,781
What does a tree need to grow?

434
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,161
Water, seeds...

435
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:37,704
A very cocky guy, by the way.

436
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,036
-Very. Yeah.
-Ha-ha-ha.

437
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:41,997
I love what Danny does there.

438
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:48,964
He just stops and enjoys
his moment of bravery, right?

439
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:58,635
That was an interesting
and cool cut you did there.

440
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:03,140
Not even seeing the rise up, you know?

441
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:06,191
I think this moment
is kind of setting the tone...

442
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:09,275
...and the dynamics
of the whole movie.

443
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:13,529
Yeah, the idea that
he really can hear anything.

444
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:17,445
He has a well-trained ear.

445
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:27,167
And the detail
of the cross on the wall...

446
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:31,585
...which is again an amazing job
of Naaman Marshall...

447
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:33,719
...the production designer.

448
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:35,471
Had so many little details there.

449
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:38,508
And you see the cross.
It used to be a cross on the wall...

450
00:24:38,686 --> 00:24:40,347
...If you take a look above the bed.

451
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:43,354
You see the shape of the cross,
but it's not there anymore.

452
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:47,768
So it tells a little bit
of the faith loss of this guy.

453
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,188
Done!

454
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:55,274
What the fuck, dude?

455
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:56,487
The guy's gassed out.

456
00:24:56,704 --> 00:24:57,694
He's out.

457
00:24:57,871 --> 00:25:00,863
I think the fact that the dog went down...

458
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:03,916
-...the same way, got neutralized...
-Mm-hm.

459
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:08,045
...I think it makes
the guy getting neutralized...

460
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:11,333
...almost a complete,
immediate buy as well.

461
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,500
Yeah.

462
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:15,591
If you think about it,
you know he's gonna wake up.

463
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:19,466
But somehow it's very helpful.

464
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:21,429
First the dog, and then him.

465
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:23,101
Yeah.

466
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:26,890
It supplies them
with the feeling of confidence...

467
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:28,725
...that they can make noise.

468
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,684
Yeah, I think...

469
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,613
Looking at the movie now,
we realize all the little details...

470
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:37,366
...that we draw that we had
to do research on.

471
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:42,197
You know, experts on
how to do all these crimes, right?

472
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:43,864
How do you put someone to sleep?

473
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:46,159
The gas thing,
the gas bottle, actually...

474
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,164
...we never got to the bottom of it...

475
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:49,920
-...if it was a myth or reality.
-Mm-hm.

476
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:53,295
But there's a lot of that myth
running around in Europe.

477
00:25:53,469 --> 00:25:56,507
People say that if you take
a night train in certain parts...

478
00:25:56,764 --> 00:25:59,631
...of Europe,
people walk into the train...

479
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,345
Robbers may go into your wagon...

480
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:06,145
...and basically smoke you
while you're sleeping...

481
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:08,272
-...and you just fall into a deeper sleep.
-Hm.

482
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:10,854
And they will rob
whatever you have with you.

483
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,152
Then we read that it was actually a myth.

484
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:15,525
That nothing can actually do that to you.

485
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:17,778
But we preferred
to believe that it works.

486
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,904
It doesn't matter.
Urban myth is powerful.

487
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:24,243
But the cool thing is that we may think
that maybe they thought it was true.

488
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:25,744
But it clearly didn't work.

489
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,415
-Yeah.
-Right.

490
00:26:27,628 --> 00:26:30,336
And this is another one, like,
the silencer...

491
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:33,255
...made with a bottle, which again,
I never saw in a movie.

492
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:36,505
We just... We read about it
and heard from a lot of people.

493
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:40,171
And the gun expert in this movie
actually told us about it.

494
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:44,217
There's a way to do a homemade silencer
which is just with a bottle.

495
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,222
And then of course, like YouTube...

496
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,554
...you have a lot of videos of people...

497
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:50,856
...shooting guns in bottles
to show it works.

498
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:52,733
-And it definitely works.
-Mm.

499
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:55,895
It muffles the gunfire.

500
00:26:56,907 --> 00:26:59,865
But obviously,
it didn't muffle it enough.

501
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,776
Because here we are.

502
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:03,695
Who's there?

503
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:10,118
This is definitely one of those moments...

504
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:12,286
...that when we were writing the script...

505
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:16,298
...you knew it was gonna be
an intense scene, right?

506
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:18,672
Yeah, this was always my favorite scene.

507
00:27:18,846 --> 00:27:22,089
This is the first time that
Stephen Lang's character speaks.

508
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:27,181
And he sounds like
a normal, harmless man.

509
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:29,679
-He's scared, right?
-He's scared, yeah.

510
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:33,979
We talked about this a lot, remember,
when we were shooting this.

511
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:36,652
And did it quite a number of times...

512
00:27:36,864 --> 00:27:38,275
...trying to modulate...

513
00:27:38,532 --> 00:27:39,863
...you know...

514
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:45,411
...the amount
of fear with strength.

515
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:47,784
That's what I love
about your work in the scene.

516
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,617
I can see how, knowing what I know...

517
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:54,207
...about the character,
knowing all his secrets...

518
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:57,794
...right there, I can see how
at first his reaction, of course...

519
00:27:57,968 --> 00:27:59,675
...he doesn't know
how much they know.

520
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:01,461
Maybe they took her away already.

521
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,546
Maybe she's gone. Maybe she's...

522
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:09,602
Maybe that precious cargo
he has in the cellar...

523
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:10,886
Maybe she's not there.

524
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:13,351
By this point, I can see
how you start realizing...

525
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:15,774
...that they haven't
opened the door yet.

526
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:18,315
Well, they did,
but they're not down there yet.

527
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:21,105
They don't sound like
they know what's going on.

528
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:24,738
And how you go from...

529
00:28:24,912 --> 00:28:28,405
...being startled and scared
to suddenly, "I can see.

530
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:32,959
I can hear your thoughts as you go.
Okay, I gotta do this.

531
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:35,457
-I have to."
-Yeah, it's interesting...

532
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:37,788
...to see how he made a choice
in a second.

533
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,798
Like, "I have to take care of this guy.

534
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:42,085
-There's no way around it."
-Yeah.

535
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:49,725
-Whoo!
-Yeah.

536
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:51,848
There was a point that we actually...

537
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:54,684
We never really seriously
thought about doing it...

538
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:59,068
...but I fantasized about the idea
of making this movie black and white...

539
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:06,238
...because there's something
so classic film noir of Hollywood.

540
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:10,279
You have a section coming up
that is total noir.

541
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:11,822
Yeah.

542
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:13,498
-Right? I mean, you did it.
-Heh, heh.

543
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:17,954
And the colors are so rich,
I think, that it's...

544
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:20,589
It makes it a pleasure to watch...

545
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:25,879
...even when what you're watching
is not all that pleasurable in a way.

546
00:29:26,056 --> 00:29:29,344
This is a very important moment
for Money's character...

547
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:32,931
...because at the end,
he redeems himself, right?

548
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:35,979
In saying that it's just him...

549
00:29:36,984 --> 00:29:38,019
...in the house...

550
00:29:38,235 --> 00:29:41,603
...when the Blind Man asks,
"How many of you are there?"

551
00:29:41,822 --> 00:29:43,483
Before he dies he's doing something...

552
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:47,283
-At least something good.
-Yeah, he's doing good for her.

553
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:51,446
He might have cowered up
and asked for help...

554
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:54,706
...or told him there's a witness
there as well...

555
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:56,617
...and maybe that perhaps...

556
00:29:56,837 --> 00:29:59,750
...he might have thought
that was gonna save him.

557
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:01,876
I don't think it would have, but...

558
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:08,216
Poor Danny.
You really rough him up there.

559
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:12,095
I think I told you
about the story when...

560
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:16,976
...the first kind of really rough
encounter that we shot...

561
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:21,063
...was actually later in the movie.
It was you against...

562
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:22,860
Against Alex, right?

563
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,612
-Played by Dylan Minnette.
-Mm-hm.

564
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:27,990
And after that day,
Dylan was like, "Oh, man."

565
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:32,244
He went to Danny Zovatto,
who plays Money...

566
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:35,448
...and warned him about that.
He warned him like, "Look.

567
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,704
If you ask Slang to bring it,
he'll bring it.

568
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,870
You better be ready
because it's gonna be a tough scene.

569
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:44,291
Your body is gonna be in pain
for the rest of the week."

570
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:47,085
You know, I've heard that.

571
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:52,974
And the thing is, I take slight exception
to it because we were pretty careful.

572
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:55,051
-Of course it's safe.
-It's rugged stuff.

573
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:57,595
-You know what I mean?
-There's no way to fake that.

574
00:30:57,773 --> 00:30:59,059
There's no way to fake that.

575
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:01,394
As a director,
the last thing I want is to see...

576
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:03,150
...that thing
being faked too much.

577
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,561
And remember that Danny
always tells the story...

578
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:09,107
...that he actually asked you,
"You've got to bring it. Just bring it.

579
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:10,490
I'll take it."

580
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:13,903
But then at the end of that day,
I remember him coming back to me.

581
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:17,540
Like, "Oh, man." He was terrified.
But that's a great thing.

582
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:20,952
I think that's something you really
brought to the film and the set...

583
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:25,498
...that every time you walk on set,
I could feel these kids.

584
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:30,215
Because a lot of them, they're just
making their second, third movie.

585
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:33,472
Except for Dylan over there,
who made like 20 movies.

586
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:37,142
He's been working since he was 5.

587
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:44,309
But there was a sense of respect and fear
that I enjoyed so much watching.

588
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:46,773
-And you can see it.
-think a lot of that fear...

589
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:49,985
Because as a rule, I was
just pretty quiet in between takes.

590
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:52,365
-Just sitting there quietly.
-Yeah.

591
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:54,447
I think that it was them
doing their work.

592
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:58,785
That they were projecting an awful lot
of intimidation from me.

593
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:02,953
And I was just sitting there.
They were doing my work for me.

594
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:05,838
They were just wonderful, I thought.
So game.

595
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,247
-Yeah.
-So canny.

596
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:09,633
Each one of them, they really brought it.

597
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:14,092
The physicality in the way
that you guys play those scenes...

598
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:15,256
...IS very important.

599
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:17,971
One of the things that
we were kind of nervous about...

600
00:32:18,145 --> 00:32:20,807
...when we came up
with the idea is that...

601
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:23,480
...if this guy is a blind guy...

602
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:27,143
...and there's three kids, people will
think, "Why don't they take on him?

603
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:28,944
Why don't they fight him?"

604
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:31,276
Why don't they just jump on him
and that's it?

605
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:34,988
But in that scene
where you fight Money...

606
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,739
-...and start punching the wall...
-Mm-hm.

607
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:39,405
...then it's clear
that it's not an easy task.

608
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:42,245
So that makes the whole premise work.

609
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:46,128
Otherwise, I think
it would have collapsed.

610
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:49,422
There's not a single moment
of this movie when you feel...

611
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:52,927
When you think as an audience,
"Oh, they should just jump on him."

612
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:54,302
Heh. There's no way.

613
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:59,179
Like, this kind of shot,
it establishes dominance.

614
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:03,516
Even though he doesn't know he's here,
he's dominating the house in a way.

615
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,557
And they're just cowering in corners.

616
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:08,521
I was gonna say, look at that...

617
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:10,853
-...how small he is right there.
-That's a great shot.

618
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:19,445
And also,
let's not forget that part of the thing...

619
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:23,749
...that makes your presence so menacing
and makes all this so real...

620
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:27,128
...were the contact lenses
that you were wearing.

621
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:29,789
How much could you see?
You couldn't see a lot, right?

622
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:32,958
So remember that somebody
would bring you to the set?

623
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:36,011
And you were really becoming
that character on so many levels.

624
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:38,843
Just the fact that you
got to know that house pretty well.

625
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:43,011
I don't remember seeing you
bumping against anything...

626
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:45,062
...during the whole making
of the movie.

627
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:47,599
-And you could barely see with those.
-Right. Right.

628
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:51,314
The lenses were extremely helpful...

629
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:58,277
...because they're
a constant obstacle...

630
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,865
...and a constant reminder.

631
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:05,791
Because it cuts
your vision down by 70 percent.

632
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:09,711
And the rest of it, that other 30 percent,
you kind of just let go.

633
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:13,044
-You just sort of glaze out, I think.
-Yeah.

634
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:18,300
So it was extremely helpful.

635
00:34:18,515 --> 00:34:22,850
But so much of the blindness,
when I watch the film...

636
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:28,480
...Is really sold by the direction
that you would give me...

637
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:34,612
...when you would say, "Slang,
just tilt your head that way more."

638
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:38,866
And it all had to do with
how the camera was perceiving me...

639
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:42,198
...and perceiving my relationship
with whoever was in the room...

640
00:34:42,372 --> 00:34:44,079
...or what I was listening to.

641
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:48,994
So that was a good duet,
I thought, between actor and director.

642
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:53,334
Or trio really, between actor,
director, and the camera itself.

643
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:57,172
One of the things
that I loved that you brought...

644
00:34:57,345 --> 00:35:00,337
...is the idea of those marks in the wall.

645
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:03,678
That was not on the script, obviously.

646
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:06,760
The fact that the guy...

647
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,680
...he gets around the house
touching the wall.

648
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:13,021
-Touching the wall all the time.
-There should be stains on the wall.

649
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:16,403
Those marks that have been happening
for a long, long time.

650
00:35:16,573 --> 00:35:18,029
That's the production designer.

651
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:20,782
Naaman Marshall had
so many details like that...

652
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,488
...that you can really believe...

653
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:26,200
...that this house is a place
that he has lived for a long time.

654
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:28,657
Rocky, hey, are you okay?

655
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:30,325
Are you okay?

656
00:35:31,004 --> 00:35:34,213
Maybe... Maybe we should
call the cops before he does.

657
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:36,131
I like this moment. It's the last...

658
00:35:37,052 --> 00:35:39,384
...moment of Alex
trying to do the right thing.

659
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:42,342
He believes they should call the cops.

660
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:46,391
And if they do that, perhaps,
they might hear their...

661
00:35:46,603 --> 00:35:49,846
They might go to jail perhaps,
but at least they're not gonna die.

662
00:35:50,023 --> 00:35:55,393
And Alex is really trying
to get her alive out of here.

663
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,026
But she has different plans.

664
00:35:57,197 --> 00:35:59,939
She's the boss.
She really is the boss.

665
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:05,574
And it's really cool
how things went south.

666
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:06,737
-Money got shot.
-Ha, ha.

667
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:09,782
But at the same time,
they find the money.

668
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:12,959
And it's even a lot more money
than they thought it would be.

669
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:15,746
-So that raises the stakes.
-It's good we never show it.

670
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:19,333
Watching I realize the camera...

671
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:21,338
...never shows you like,
"Look, money."

672
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:23,090
It never pushes inside the box.

673
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:27,174
It never shows you the bag.
You just see the blocks of money.

674
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:29,969
And they're even blurry
in most of the shots.

675
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:33,639
Because the story
was never really about the cash.

676
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:36,520
But you know they have
something that they want.

677
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:39,941
Well, her movie is about the money.

678
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:41,191
-Ha-ha-ha.
-Yeah, of course.

679
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:43,653
But the way it's played over there...

680
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,700
...It's so much more about...

681
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,908
...what she wants to do against
what he wants to do at some point.

682
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:52,916
That was... Why did you go outside
there? Why were we on that door?

683
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:55,327
Oh, because he said... I love this moment.

684
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:58,497
He said out loud that that's the way out.

685
00:36:58,675 --> 00:37:01,918
And he says the storm door cellar.

686
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:06,381
It was a brief reminder to the audience,
what was that door?

687
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:10,222
And I think it really helps the audience
to know where we're going...

688
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:12,261
...and what they're trying to achieve.

689
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:15,602
I don't like when in stories like this
the audience gets confused...

690
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:19,063
...about where they're heading.
Where they're going. What's their plan?

691
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:25,116
I wanted be very clear and precise about,
what's the plan here for these kids?

692
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:27,617
That makes a lot of sense.

693
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:31,951
I think this scene is kind of like
the spirit of the whole movie.

694
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:34,492
This is where we wanted
to get with the idea of...

695
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:37,578
-This is one of my favorite moments.
-...the guy being blind.

696
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:42,216
It's when we start thinking about
the movie and the idea of the movie.

697
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:44,467
Thinking about these moments
is when we thought:

698
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,465
"Oh, it's gonna be special.

699
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,596
This is worth making.

700
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:51,175
I've never seen this scene before."

701
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:53,810
And right here,
it's almost like a ghost story.

702
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:58,440
It's almost like for you, right,
the Blind Man, it's a ghost story.

703
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:00,271
There is a presence in his house...

704
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:02,569
...that even though he can't see it...

705
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:04,355
...he suspects it might be there.

706
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:08,275
But it's such a strange thing.
And it works so well.

707
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:10,444
It's ghosts that you can shoot.

708
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:12,158
That's right.

709
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:19,620
Here's when the title
really comes back to you.

710
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:23,707
I'm really waiting for the end.

711
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,214
The breathing you hear
is the Blind Man's.

712
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,842
Heavier than anybody else. It's great.

713
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:32,053
I can see that he's worried.

714
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:34,059
And he suspects there might be someone.

715
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:38,393
This is the best.

716
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:42,142
And also, this moment is very important.

717
00:38:42,529 --> 00:38:44,190
That already happened before.

718
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:45,900
Something we want
to get out of the way is...

719
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:48,982
...we want to make sure the audience
doesn't suspect the twist...

720
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,652
...of this movie was gonna be
he can actually see.

721
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,036
That would be terrible.

722
00:38:53,206 --> 00:38:54,696
So, with scenes like this one...

723
00:38:54,916 --> 00:39:00,036
...is when you know that we're not
hiding anything from the audience.

724
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:01,586
And also how dangerous he is.

725
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:05,249
He hears the cell phone and reacts...

726
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:08,301
...in a fraction of a second
and shoots spot on.

727
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:13,557
Yeah, this is a time...

728
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:17,344
By this moment,
the movie has introduced, like...

729
00:39:17,564 --> 00:39:19,100
...this is them against him.

730
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:22,517
And this is how good they are,
and this is how good he is.

731
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:27,188
So we'll see if they manage
to get away with the money, right?

732
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,356
That could happen right now.

733
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:31,525
-Yeah.
-From our point of view.

734
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:33,159
Yeah.

735
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:38,036
I guess, yeah, I'm curious...

736
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:41,952
I don't know if the audience expected it,
if they know what's coming.

737
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:44,629
I'm sure they know
there's something more to it.

738
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:49,168
I think at least the first screenings
that we had of this movie...

739
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:52,671
...because people were coming in
without seeing any trailers...

740
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:54,465
...they didn't know about it.

741
00:39:54,851 --> 00:39:58,060
And the moment that's coming right now...

742
00:39:58,271 --> 00:39:59,761
...Is such a huge surprise
for everybody.

743
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:09,029
This is a great moment as well.

744
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,781
We're exploring all his senses.

745
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:16,366
We already explored
how he can hear anything.

746
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:18,746
Now we can explore
how he can smell anything.

747
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:24,461
Again, I think people tend to believe...

748
00:40:24,631 --> 00:40:27,248
-...blind people have better smell.
-Mm-hm.

749
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:30,759
But it's not really that. It's just
that they pay more attention to it.

750
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:36,140
They have developed that more
just by using it more than we do.

751
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:40,227
But it's not a super sense.
We never went too far in that aspect.

752
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:44,560
I mean, anybody can smell a pair
of smelly shoes, heh, heh, in a room.

753
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:49,820
And Money's shoes are the first ones
he found. I'm sure they're quite smelly.

754
00:40:57,705 --> 00:41:02,370
Yeah, things are gonna
turn upside down pretty fast.

755
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:12,296
That money's gone.

756
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:19,092
Yeah, I love
how vulnerable you are there.

757
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:24,688
How the audience will feel,
"Oh, man, they fooled him.

758
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:26,347
They made a fool out of him...

759
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:30,151
...by looking over his shoulder
and seeing the code."

760
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,187
That's what's going through his mind.

761
00:41:32,365 --> 00:41:34,606
He's so frustrated.
At the same time...

762
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:38,364
...that's the moment that,
in the whole movie I think...

763
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:42,497
...it's that moment there when
the Blind Man realizes he's been...

764
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:45,952
You know,
he's just been fooled by these kids...

765
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,582
...Is when your empathy
is really with him.

766
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,918
It's so strongly with him.
I think most of the audience...

767
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:53,459
...at this point is like,
"Why'd they do that to him?

768
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:55,718
-Right.
-And at that moment...

769
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:58,721
...we change everything around
by showing this girl.

770
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:05,475
That was the piano moment there.

771
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:07,730
-Remember the sitting on the piano?
-Yeah.

772
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:11,401
I loved that.

773
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:14,233
You actually can hear some of that.

774
00:42:14,407 --> 00:42:20,653
But also it's a great job
of Gardner Gould...

775
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:25,287
...the editor,
when he would basically decide...

776
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,996
...let's not show her right away.

777
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:29,753
We see a jump,
we see that someone shows up.

778
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:32,334
But instead of staying
and showing the audience...

779
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:36,877
...we just cut back upstairs
to the Blind Man and stay with him.

780
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:40,923
And basically get the audience
to be desperate to go back in there...

781
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,762
...and find out what that was...

782
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:45,889
...and who was that girl?

783
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:47,099
What?

784
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:50,689
Rocky? Rocky.

785
00:42:52,445 --> 00:42:54,402
Rocky, listen. Hey, that's our exit.

786
00:42:54,614 --> 00:42:55,649
He did a good job.

787
00:42:55,865 --> 00:42:58,653
The Blind Man did a great job
taking care of her.

788
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:02,866
With the cushions and the plants,
to have oxygen.

789
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:07,328
Yeah. It kind of gives new meaning
to the term man cave, doesn't it?

790
00:43:07,502 --> 00:43:09,368
-Completely.
-Ha-ha-ha.

791
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,703
-We have to get her out of here.
-No, no, no.

792
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:14,794
So that first
short glimpse of the newspaper...

793
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:18,050
...Is basically when they find out...

794
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:20,253
...that she was absolved of the crime.

795
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:23,014
That she actually did something terrible.

796
00:43:23,226 --> 00:43:24,762
But she was found innocent.

797
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:29,521
But that doesn't mean she was innocent.
I believe she was very, very guilty.

798
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:32,520
But the law found her innocent.

799
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:36,982
And we'll find out more eventually
when the Blind Man talks about it.

800
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:41,279
But this is actually the first...

801
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:43,864
Yeah, probably the first
or second shot...

802
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:46,120
...you did in character as the Blind Man.

803
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:50,162
-Really?
-This is the first day on set, I believe.

804
00:43:54,924 --> 00:43:58,133
-I hang off the thing and look down.
-Yeah.

805
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:03,638
Mislead the audience to believe
that you're going after them.

806
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:08,511
-2-9-7-8.7-8, 7-8.2-9-7-8.
-2-9-7-8.

807
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:11,141
It's something that during the writing...

808
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:13,147
...and not just the writing
but the making...

809
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:16,651
...we were always trying to keep
close attention to those details...

810
00:44:16,863 --> 00:44:21,528
...and make sure that every movement
they make made sense.

811
00:44:21,868 --> 00:44:24,576
And here it wasn't just
for the value of the shock...

812
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:26,778
...of what's gonna happen next.

813
00:44:26,998 --> 00:44:29,205
But I think...
I don't know if you agree, Slang.

814
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:33,752
I think it made complete sense
that if he went after them...

815
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:38,210
...that might have gone wrong.
He was expect...

816
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:39,419
That's how smart he is.

817
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:43,337
He knows that if they took the money
out of his safe upstairs...

818
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:46,097
...they know the code.
If they know the code...

819
00:44:46,309 --> 00:44:48,391
...he knows
it's the same as downstairs...

820
00:44:48,561 --> 00:44:50,973
...which means they might
have the keys already.

821
00:44:51,147 --> 00:44:53,184
Which means if he decides
to go after them...

822
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:56,975
...and maybe he doesn't manage to get
to them and block a door or something...

823
00:44:57,153 --> 00:45:00,441
...they will get to this door before
he does and they will be out.

824
00:45:00,615 --> 00:45:01,980
And that's not good for him.

825
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:05,409
So that's why I think he very quickly
put all that together.

826
00:45:06,204 --> 00:45:10,619
Turns around and decides
to wait for them on the other side.

827
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:11,781
Absolutely.

828
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:14,701
Since they've gone
down the rabbit hole...

829
00:45:14,921 --> 00:45:16,662
...he knows they're coming out.

830
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:18,375
There's only one way to come out.

831
00:45:19,592 --> 00:45:21,048
And he's doing more than that.

832
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:23,677
By this point he already...
We'll find out later.

833
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:26,713
But at this point,
he already took the dog.

834
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:28,427
He put him inside the house.

835
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:32,348
And he went after them probably.

836
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:36,227
Because now he's gonna go after them.

837
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:38,979
But we'll see that the dog
is already inside the house.

838
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:40,985
So he's done all that very quickly.

839
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:44,815
He ran out, took the dog inside,
closed the door...

840
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:47,609
...and went after them.
So it's incredible.

841
00:45:47,787 --> 00:45:49,778
I would love to see
this movie over again...

842
00:45:49,956 --> 00:45:51,367
...from his point of view.

843
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:53,577
And realizing the clever things
he's doing...

844
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,542
...one after the other.

845
00:45:56,796 --> 00:46:00,289
I think this is an interesting twist.

846
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:03,549
We just introduced this girl,
and she's dying already.

847
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:07,800
Yeah. Everybody thinks it'll be about...
Now it's all gonna be about:

848
00:46:07,974 --> 00:46:10,841
"Okay, are they
gonna be able to save the girl?"

849
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:13,885
But very quickly, she's gone.

850
00:46:14,105 --> 00:46:20,067
Well, you've already established
your credentials as somewhat merciless.

851
00:46:20,236 --> 00:46:24,400
You know, heh, heh,
and I mean that in a very good way.

852
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:31,411
Because the dispatching
of Money is quick, and it's early.

853
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:32,612
Yeah.

854
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:36,658
And he's a substantial character.
He cuts a wide swath while he's there.

855
00:46:36,836 --> 00:46:37,997
If you kill him off...

856
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:40,874
...well, then you dudes
are capable of anything.

857
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:43,415
And that was
one of the first ideas that we got.

858
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:47,051
Like, these guys break into
this Blind Man's house.

859
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:50,509
-And one of them dies right away.
-Mm-hm.

860
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:54,343
That will make you nervous and tense
throughout the whole movie.

861
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:57,812
You will know that he doesn't hesitate.

862
00:46:57,982 --> 00:47:00,064
The Blind Man didn't even...

863
00:47:00,276 --> 00:47:01,562
He asked one question.

864
00:47:01,736 --> 00:47:06,355
The only relevant question was
"How many people in the house?"

865
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:08,773
And hoping that he might
or might not be honest.

866
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:12,569
Or maybe he might have caught him lying.

867
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:13,987
No!

868
00:47:14,165 --> 00:47:16,156
I love this scene too.

869
00:47:16,334 --> 00:47:18,245
This raises a lot of questions as well.

870
00:47:18,419 --> 00:47:23,004
Like, why is he feeling this so much?

871
00:47:25,176 --> 00:47:26,166
Yeah.

872
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:28,005
You did an amazing job here, Slang.

873
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:31,672
It's one of those that...
When you're shooting...

874
00:47:31,891 --> 00:47:33,256
...it's hard to get into the scene.

875
00:47:33,434 --> 00:47:37,018
For the director, it's hard to get
into the emotion of the movie.

876
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:38,474
There's so much you pay attention to.

877
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:41,560
This one was one of those
that while I was watching the shot...

878
00:47:41,734 --> 00:47:44,396
...I felt like I was in the theater
watching the movie.

879
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:46,356
I was so excited.

880
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:50,865
Just an emotional transformation
from being in hunter mode...

881
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:55,245
...and realize what they just did,
and, oh, man, now it's personal.

882
00:47:55,456 --> 00:47:58,039
Before it wasn't.
It was like, I don't care who you are.

883
00:47:58,209 --> 00:48:00,576
You're just gonna die
because you know my secret...

884
00:48:00,753 --> 00:48:02,869
...and I cannot let you go.

885
00:48:03,089 --> 00:48:05,706
-Now I think it's personal.
-Right.

886
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:08,925
I mean, the thing that...
The prevailing thing that goes on...

887
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:13,846
...when he knows who it is...

888
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:19,056
...is this feeling of being
bereft immediately, you know?

889
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:23,690
But there's no time for that.
There's no time for grief at all.

890
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:26,188
Because he's in a war zone here.
You know?

891
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:31,440
Yeah. Because his feelings
about that girl are rather complex.

892
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:33,403
-Yeah.
-They are.

893
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:38,913
Because mostly... I mean, he definitely
has... I'm sure he has feelings.

894
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:44,578
And he's not a guy that is taken by hate.

895
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,962
I don't think he's in
that place right now.

896
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:48,380
He's past that probably.

897
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:50,087
But he definitely...

898
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:53,795
You know, we'll find out later
she was pregnant.

899
00:48:53,973 --> 00:48:58,308
So that scene there
is his daughter dying again.

900
00:48:58,477 --> 00:49:00,138
-Right.
-That's why it's so powerful.

901
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:02,303
Because he's been through that already...

902
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:05,394
...when he found out
about his daughter dying.

903
00:49:05,568 --> 00:49:08,276
And we always imagine
that he was actually on that day...

904
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:11,188
...when his daughter got run over...

905
00:49:11,407 --> 00:49:13,944
...he was right there in his house
and ran to her body.

906
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:18,370
So I think that for him,
it's just going through that pain again.

907
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:21,406
So that's why he makes it so determined.

908
00:49:21,584 --> 00:49:24,702
Because from this point on
there's no hesitation.

909
00:49:24,879 --> 00:49:27,997
There's no fear whatsoever
from the point of view of the Blind Man.

910
00:49:28,174 --> 00:49:31,542
He's completely, full-on in hunter mode.

911
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:36,300
But you know if he had the moment
to think about it...

912
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:39,007
-...he wouldn't have been surprised.
-Yeah.

913
00:49:39,185 --> 00:49:43,144
Because everything that life's given him
has just been a kick in the ass.

914
00:49:43,314 --> 00:49:45,021
I love that fan thing, by the way.

915
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:47,348
He knows every detail.

916
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:50,526
And this scene,
it's one of my favorites in the movie.

917
00:49:50,738 --> 00:49:54,857
But it's sort of whimsical in a way
because he could just touch the fan...

918
00:49:55,034 --> 00:49:58,117
-...but he gives it a little spin. Heh, heh.
-Heh-heh-heh.

919
00:49:58,287 --> 00:50:03,327
This scene was also
one of the earliest ideas that we got.

920
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:06,914
We knew that we were gonna
kill one of them pretty quick.

921
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:12,048
We knew that we were gonna have
this full dark scene.

922
00:50:12,218 --> 00:50:15,961
This took so much preparing and thinking.

923
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:21,053
Just in the early stages of preproduction
with Pedro, the DP.

924
00:50:21,227 --> 00:50:24,060
We were like, "There are many things
we need to solve here.

925
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:28,014
But the main one is how are we
gonna do the darkness scene?"

926
00:50:28,234 --> 00:50:30,601
On the page it says,
"Well, he flips a switch...

927
00:50:30,778 --> 00:50:33,145
-...and everything goes completely dark."
-Mm-hm.

928
00:50:33,322 --> 00:50:36,565
Which of course gives us moments
like this one we're looking at now.

929
00:50:36,784 --> 00:50:37,899
Which are unique.

930
00:50:38,077 --> 00:50:40,239
But look at the way she's...

931
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:42,786
She's just selling it beautifully there,
isn't she?

932
00:50:42,957 --> 00:50:46,040
Totally.
You really believe what she's doing.

933
00:50:46,335 --> 00:50:48,121
You see? I don't know if you notice...

934
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:51,583
...but every time you shoot the gun,
there's color pumped into the shot.

935
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:55,508
Of course, the logic is, if there's
no light, there's no color. Right?

936
00:50:55,678 --> 00:50:59,046
And so that's why I think
the audience buys it so well.

937
00:50:59,265 --> 00:51:00,881
Black and white and no shadows...

938
00:51:02,351 --> 00:51:05,935
...that indicates that there's no light.

939
00:51:06,105 --> 00:51:09,564
But every time we shoot the gun,
there's a muzzle flash.

940
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:13,518
By the way, for anybody that's thinking,
"Conveniently he ran out of bullets."

941
00:51:13,696 --> 00:51:14,857
We actually counted them.

942
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:17,613
It's precisely how many bullets
there are in that gun.

943
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:19,945
The ones that he shot
are exactly the gun's...

944
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:22,785
The bullets that you have in that gun.

945
00:51:22,955 --> 00:51:26,664
-I remember that discussion as well.
-Ha-ha-ha.

946
00:51:26,834 --> 00:51:29,952
We counted all of them,
particularly when we were editing...

947
00:51:30,129 --> 00:51:33,622
...because you might have shot
more shots like in the shooting itself.

948
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:36,461
But then when we cut the movie,
we made sure...

949
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:39,343
...that we had the exact amount
in that gun.

950
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:44,223
This way. This way, come on.
This way, come on, come on, come on.

951
00:51:44,435 --> 00:51:46,767
Oh, come on. Where am I?

952
00:51:47,021 --> 00:51:48,432
This was a combination...

953
00:51:48,606 --> 00:51:50,847
...of the light from the camera
and the whole treatment.

954
00:51:51,025 --> 00:51:56,270
But as well they had contact lenses
making their eyes look dilated.

955
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:58,688
Their pupils dilated.

956
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:03,026
But of course, Jane Levy
and Dylan Minnette did an amazing job...

957
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:06,412
...selling the full darkness.

958
00:52:06,582 --> 00:52:08,368
They did. And it's not just the eyes.

959
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:12,160
Also it's the open mouth.

960
00:52:12,338 --> 00:52:13,703
-Yeah.
-You know, in a way.

961
00:52:13,881 --> 00:52:16,999
Ha-ha-ha, that is a great shot.
Ha-ha-ha.

962
00:52:17,176 --> 00:52:19,338
When you think it's over,
it's just beginning.

963
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:22,094
That's what happens constantly
in this movie.

964
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:25,723
Try the blue key. Do it.

965
00:52:25,893 --> 00:52:27,975
Ha, ha, that dog.

966
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:32,225
There are three dogs in this movie.
Three different dogs that you see.

967
00:52:34,735 --> 00:52:36,021
I'm trying to remember names.

968
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:38,318
Oh, gosh.

969
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:41,989
-Athos, that's one of them.
-Athos.

970
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:45,151
Athos. There was...
What was the other one?

971
00:52:45,371 --> 00:52:48,204
-Porthos and Aramis. I don't think it was.
-Ha-ha-ha. Exactly.

972
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:52,367
I love this twist when suddenly,
he decides to sit down...

973
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:54,581
...which obviously wasn't in the script.

974
00:52:54,755 --> 00:52:56,211
We were shooting the moment.

975
00:52:56,382 --> 00:52:58,623
When the dog was supposed
to be looking fierce...

976
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:00,128
...he decided to sit down.

977
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:01,792
But I ended up keeping it.

978
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:05,213
I thought it was a really good twist
that he talks to him.

979
00:53:05,683 --> 00:53:06,923
Maybe he'll talk him down.

980
00:53:07,101 --> 00:53:11,937
Some dogs, if you talk to them calmly,
they might respond to that.

981
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:13,808
He's also a little hungover.

982
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:15,856
Yeah. Yeah. Definitely.

983
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:20,061
And the dog was actually chasing them.

984
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:24,775
-So there was no faking there as well.
-Ha-ha-ha.

985
00:53:24,952 --> 00:53:25,942
Yeah.

986
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:29,033
We were guaranteeing them
that the dog wasn't gonna attack.

987
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:33,040
But they weren't counting on the promise.
They were just running...

988
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:38,588
...like maniacs, trying to get in the room
before the dog got to his mark.

989
00:53:40,968 --> 00:53:42,049
You're back.

990
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:45,337
They felt the same way about the dog
that they did about me.

991
00:53:45,514 --> 00:53:49,382
That we're both
just sort of slavering maniacs.

992
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:52,348
And the dog was a sweetheart,
just like me.

993
00:53:56,275 --> 00:53:57,936
See, that's the thing here.

994
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:01,819
It's one of those stories where...

995
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:03,145
What are you doing?

996
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:05,314
Regardless of what the Blind Man does...

997
00:54:05,534 --> 00:54:08,117
...there's no question at any moment.

998
00:54:08,287 --> 00:54:12,781
Everything he's doing, if you were him,
you would do the same thing.

999
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,788
There's nothing to talk about
with them, there's nothing to...

1000
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:19,082
There's no conversation.
The Blind Man has to get rid of them.

1001
00:54:19,298 --> 00:54:21,289
Because there's no way
he can let them go...

1002
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:25,172
...and trust that they're not gonna
tell his secret or anything like that.

1003
00:54:25,846 --> 00:54:28,133
There's no way around that.

1004
00:54:28,724 --> 00:54:30,306
I remember we talked about this.

1005
00:54:30,476 --> 00:54:33,218
His goal is not to make them suffer.

1006
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:37,555
He really doesn't want to punish them
or make them suffer.

1007
00:54:37,775 --> 00:54:39,766
It's not about that.
He has to kill them.

1008
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:42,150
But, you know, there's this...

1009
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:46,822
To me, there's this
sense of outrage in this film.

1010
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:51,327
That this outrage was perpetrated
against him, against his life.

1011
00:54:51,747 --> 00:54:56,662
You know, he's gonna talk about it a
little bit, in terms of God and everything.

1012
00:54:57,085 --> 00:54:58,667
But, um...

1013
00:55:00,172 --> 00:55:02,163
-Whoot! Eh...
-Whoa.

1014
00:55:02,466 --> 00:55:04,377
And it's just, um...

1015
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:06,922
He just will not allow that.

1016
00:55:07,221 --> 00:55:13,308
He needs... He becomes proactive.
It's almost... It's everything he's doing.

1017
00:55:13,477 --> 00:55:16,595
Yeah, it's against these kids,
but it's really against the world.

1018
00:55:16,772 --> 00:55:18,809
It's against the cosmos.
It's against God.

1019
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:23,522
It's against this everything
that has just destroyed his being.

1020
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:26,733
I think that
what you're saying is really spot on.

1021
00:55:26,907 --> 00:55:32,277
And that is a common thing
for all the characters in the movie.

1022
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:34,741
Rocky's character
kind of feels the same way.

1023
00:55:34,915 --> 00:55:38,579
She feels like
life hasn't given her anything.

1024
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:42,120
In fact, she's been very unlucky
with the life that she got.

1025
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:47,007
And she's, in a way,
trying to bring justice on her own terms.

1026
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:50,511
And she feels entitled to do this,
to go get that money.

1027
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:53,173
She feels like she deserves that.

1028
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:57,139
I think all the characters are trying
to bring justice...

1029
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:59,303
-...in their own way.
-Mm.

1030
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:01,313
That's the moral of the story, I think.

1031
00:56:01,942 --> 00:56:05,651
It's like if all of us
just decide to violate all the rules...

1032
00:56:05,821 --> 00:56:09,780
...and just go and get whatever we want
and feel that we deserve...

1033
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:11,987
...like, you get these scenarios, right?

1034
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:16,119
Like, because she will find out...
She basically finds someone that thinks...

1035
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:20,875
...ironically, just like her. The Blind
Man and Rocky have a lot in common.

1036
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:23,957
Just the Blind Man's
been through a lot more than she did.

1037
00:56:24,131 --> 00:56:27,499
But they both believe
that they have the right...

1038
00:56:27,676 --> 00:56:30,839
...to break the rules
just to get what they feel...

1039
00:56:31,013 --> 00:56:32,378
...they deserve and...

1040
00:56:32,556 --> 00:56:35,594
We'll leave to the audience
to believe if that's right or not.

1041
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:40,307
But that was definitely the...
Thematically was the strong, you know...

1042
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:44,348
Just the way... I just wanna cut in
and say the way that the dog, Athos...

1043
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:47,188
...the way he has to crouch
his way through there...

1044
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:49,228
...and everything like that, it just...

1045
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:52,615
That in and of itself,
it's in two shots, is just so alarming.

1046
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:55,196
He sort of looks like
a gigantic rat in a way.

1047
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:56,735
-Yeah. Heh, heh.
-You know?

1048
00:56:56,914 --> 00:57:02,080
I remember we were writing the script,
we had this experience on Evil Dead...

1049
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:05,040
...with the dog
that we used in that movie.

1050
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:08,296
And it was so hard
to get that dog to do anything.

1051
00:57:08,467 --> 00:57:12,210
Like, the smallest things, like,
"Hey, come here," he wouldn't do it.

1052
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:15,800
And then we wrote
all the scenes with the dog.

1053
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:18,716
And we were like, "We're never gonna
find a dog that's gonna do that.”

1054
00:57:18,936 --> 00:57:22,474
-Ha-ha-ha.
-And fortunately this amazing dog...

1055
00:57:22,648 --> 00:57:24,855
-Oh, the Hungarian dogs are very, very...
-Yeah.

1056
00:57:25,025 --> 00:57:27,357
-They're the best.
-Yeah, the best.

1057
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:30,276
That's a great twist as well.

1058
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:32,313
How you think the Blind Man's gone...

1059
00:57:32,491 --> 00:57:34,823
...actually went upstairs
and fools him again.

1060
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:37,951
He's always showing up
in places that you don't think he will.

1061
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:42,035
It's great because you're just exploiting
the geography of this house...

1062
00:57:42,209 --> 00:57:47,670
...you know, to... Almost to the max.

1063
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:50,251
But about what you were saying...

1064
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:57,263
...you know,
both for Jane and the Blind Man...

1065
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:58,922
...um...

1066
00:57:59,101 --> 00:58:03,766
...they're taking responsibility for their
lives as well. I mean, it's kind of...

1067
00:58:03,939 --> 00:58:08,934
They're making the existential choice
that they're not gonna, you know...

1068
00:58:09,111 --> 00:58:10,943
They're not gonna go quietly
into the dark.

1069
00:58:11,113 --> 00:58:13,730
They're not just gonna let life, like...

1070
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:16,990
They're not gonna accept that...
"Well, that was just bad luck."”

1071
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,525
And it's the life they got.

1072
00:58:18,704 --> 00:58:20,570
-It's like they're gonna...
-Right.

1073
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:22,738
They're gonna take matters
in their own hand...

1074
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:25,157
...and change fate.
It's almost like they know they...

1075
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:30,080
They're going... They might take a path
that is just gonna be constant darkness.

1076
00:58:30,257 --> 00:58:33,545
And they're just trying to find a way
to break out of there...

1077
00:58:33,719 --> 00:58:35,255
...right, by all means necessary.

1078
00:58:35,429 --> 00:58:38,763
That's what they're all doing.

1079
00:58:39,266 --> 00:58:43,931
There's, again,
a beautiful moment of mixing a lot of...

1080
00:58:44,104 --> 00:58:46,345
...beautiful techniques of cinema.

1081
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:49,982
It's just the silence,
the camera work, the light...

1082
00:58:50,152 --> 00:58:53,235
...everything worked so well
for me in this montage here.

1083
00:58:53,405 --> 00:58:55,362
And the title comes in right... Heh.

1084
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:58,945
Comes to you again, like, don't breathe.
It, like, makes it in that...

1085
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:00,575
He made a mistake breathing.

1086
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:11,586
Here we fool
the audience with a montage a little.

1087
00:59:11,757 --> 00:59:14,795
They don't know it
but it's been a time jump there.

1088
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:19,878
That was fun to shoot.

1089
00:59:20,057 --> 00:59:24,301
This was a rugged set to be on
right here.

1090
00:59:25,729 --> 00:59:27,561
Because it's all... This was all real.

1091
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:31,019
Not like there was a lot
of rubber stuff going on here.

1092
00:59:32,069 --> 00:59:34,436
-Aah. That hurt, I remember that.
-That hurt.

1093
00:59:35,322 --> 00:59:38,030
Because I think he missed
the countdown or something...

1094
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:41,488
...and he surprised you with it,
like, ahead of time.

1095
00:59:44,206 --> 00:59:48,791
I like that this is the first hint that
we give that if there's a sound...

1096
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:54,501
...a loud sound in the place,
then his powers disappear.

1097
00:59:55,050 --> 01:00:00,671
Heh. Like, that's his weakness,
too much... Too much noise.

1098
01:00:01,056 --> 01:00:03,764
And eventually it'll be
some sort of demise for him.

1099
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:08,848
But even...

1100
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:11,184
Like, when you're watching the movie,
like, I get this...

1101
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:14,646
Do I want him to grab the gun
and shoot the Blind Man in the head?

1102
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:18,233
I don't really know if I want that.
I don't think the audience wants that.

1103
01:00:18,406 --> 01:00:21,319
They want them to live
but that, that's what makes it...

1104
01:00:21,493 --> 01:00:24,030
I think that's what make
the movie effective...

1105
01:00:24,204 --> 01:00:25,990
...Is that you understand that...

1106
01:00:26,164 --> 01:00:29,327
...even though he's doing
something terrible, he's in his house.

1107
01:00:29,501 --> 01:00:31,833
And a lot of things he's doing,
he has the right to do them.

1108
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:34,745
And that makes it
so complicated and so complex...

1109
01:00:34,923 --> 01:00:38,962
...on that level, like, you don't...
If Alex would have reached that gun...

1110
01:00:39,136 --> 01:00:42,504
...and shoot the Blind Man in the head,
and leave, I don't think...

1111
01:00:42,681 --> 01:00:46,595
...the audience would've been satisfied.
They would be like... Like he just...

1112
01:00:46,768 --> 01:00:49,135
They break into this guy's house,
they murder him...

1113
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:53,397
...take his money away.
Like, it would be a terrible ending.

1114
01:00:54,234 --> 01:00:57,647
That's why it puts the audience
in a place that they want them to leave...

1115
01:00:57,821 --> 01:00:59,653
...but they don't want them
to shoot the Blind Man.

1116
01:00:59,823 --> 01:01:01,734
It makes it so complex
and puts the audience...

1117
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:03,273
...In a great place to be.

1118
01:01:03,451 --> 01:01:05,442
Because they want to know
how it's gonna end up.

1119
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:09,784
Yeah, yeah. Well, I mean, the Blind Man,
from my point of view has...

1120
01:01:09,958 --> 01:01:11,289
...at this point earned...

1121
01:01:12,419 --> 01:01:18,335
He's earned a lot of points. I mean,
there's reasons for his sickness...

1122
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:21,466
...and his, you know, his pathology.

1123
01:01:21,636 --> 01:01:26,130
But there's a lot about him that...
You know, he's got his own integrity.

1124
01:01:26,308 --> 01:01:28,640
Seems to me,
and I think people respond to that...

1125
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:29,925
...to an extent.

1126
01:01:30,103 --> 01:01:33,562
Yeah, well, and obviously,
just the fact that he's...

1127
01:01:33,732 --> 01:01:37,646
He's a blind character
that at first we all see...

1128
01:01:37,819 --> 01:01:38,809
Kind of almost...

1129
01:01:38,987 --> 01:01:40,853
...the audience look at the movie
and when they...

1130
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:42,897
When he gets introduced,
kind of look down on him.

1131
01:01:43,074 --> 01:01:45,736
Like, "Oh, poor guy."
We kind of feel pity for him.

1132
01:01:45,911 --> 01:01:50,997
And you realize now that... You know,
that you should feel pity for the kids...

1133
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:53,533
...and not for him.
So it's such a, it's...

1134
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:55,371
And I think that's a
quality that's in the...

1135
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:58,082
Regardless of what he's doing,
and the terrible things he's doing...

1136
01:01:58,256 --> 01:02:00,338
...like, the audience admires that.

1137
01:02:00,508 --> 01:02:02,966
The fact that a character
that was introduced...

1138
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:05,002
...in a way
that make them feel pity for him...

1139
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:07,638
...because he was blind,
and living by himself...

1140
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:10,674
...and all this tragedy.
Like, not really how capable he is.

1141
01:02:10,852 --> 01:02:14,436
And how he doesn't let something
like blindness, like, stop him.

1142
01:02:14,606 --> 01:02:17,098
-No, there's a...
-Be fully functional.

1143
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:20,142
No, I mean, the first time you see him,
he's walking the dog.

1144
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:23,688
He's doing, like, you know,
kind of an all-American activity.

1145
01:02:25,116 --> 01:02:27,403
Here again.
I think as soon as she's hitting that...

1146
01:02:27,619 --> 01:02:29,986
...the audience knows
she shouldn't be making that sound.

1147
01:02:30,789 --> 01:02:33,372
-That's a CG hand.
-Heh.

1148
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:35,157
That's actually the only CG hand.

1149
01:02:35,335 --> 01:02:38,327
One of the biggest CG elements
and that's something I personally did...

1150
01:02:38,505 --> 01:02:42,373
...on my computer when I realized
I didn't get the shot because you...

1151
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:45,292
Originally, you grab her hair.
But it wasn't on the shot...

1152
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:46,835
...and it wasn't so effective.

1153
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:50,381
And I remember cutting the movie,
I just opened my laptop and, like...

1154
01:02:50,558 --> 01:02:53,175
...let me put something together
and I did the shot.

1155
01:02:53,353 --> 01:02:54,684
And I thought
it was gonna be a mock-up...

1156
01:02:54,854 --> 01:02:58,222
...and it end up in the movie.
It ended up being that shot over there.

1157
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:02,400
I love this moment.

1158
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:06,313
Something that I stole from Hitchcock...

1159
01:03:06,491 --> 01:03:08,277
...who said that he shot...

1160
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:11,364
He shot love scenes like death scenes...

1161
01:03:11,538 --> 01:03:13,825
...and death scenes
like love scenes.

1162
01:03:13,999 --> 01:03:17,492
And this definitely looks
more like a love scene...

1163
01:03:17,669 --> 01:03:22,960
...on the setting and there's no cuts.
It's just like this long agony, right?

1164
01:03:23,133 --> 01:03:26,342
And I particularly like what...

1165
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:29,219
Using those short punches.

1166
01:03:29,389 --> 01:03:30,629
You know, there's nothing...

1167
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:33,640
Many times in movies,
you have these long loping punches.

1168
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:37,019
I mean, these are just...
Those are little... Three short punches.

1169
01:03:37,188 --> 01:03:38,428
Yeah, they look so painful.

1170
01:03:38,606 --> 01:03:42,019
What's interesting about that moment
is that I'm not exactly sure when...

1171
01:03:42,193 --> 01:03:45,026
...he realized that this...
That there was a girl...

1172
01:03:45,196 --> 01:03:47,528
...in this pack of thieves.

1173
01:03:47,699 --> 01:03:52,239
And he made the choice, "Okay, this is...

1174
01:03:52,412 --> 01:03:54,779
-This is actually good."
-Mm-hm.

1175
01:03:54,956 --> 01:03:56,742
-I might need that girl.
-Well, yeah...

1176
01:03:56,916 --> 01:03:59,658
I don't know when exactly it happens
but it could have happened...

1177
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:01,167
...also when he found the shoes.

1178
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:03,290
When he smelled her shoes,
I think he knows.

1179
01:04:03,465 --> 01:04:05,172
We were joking, he knows there's a girl.

1180
01:04:05,342 --> 01:04:06,503
And he knows that.
He maybe even knows...

1181
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:10,965
...that she's having her period, ha, ha,
like, stuff like that. Like, "Hm..."

1182
01:04:11,139 --> 01:04:13,631
I don't think she has her period.
That would have save her, actually.

1183
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:16,846
Yeah, but I mean, the idea
that he can use her...

1184
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:19,057
...because the other girl is dead...

1185
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:20,720
-When does that happen?
-Yeah.

1186
01:04:20,899 --> 01:04:23,607
I mean, I think if you wanna
project it into that...

1187
01:04:23,777 --> 01:04:26,189
...into the kind of weird
love scene upstairs...

1188
01:04:26,363 --> 01:04:29,321
...that we just saw, you can do that.
You know, but that's for...

1189
01:04:29,491 --> 01:04:31,778
Please, let me go!

1190
01:04:31,993 --> 01:04:34,530
I think dialogue's
come back here, which is, uh...

1191
01:04:35,955 --> 01:04:40,040
-The funny and interesting thing...
-Nobody's said anything for 40 minutes.

1192
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:42,325
You wanted her to pay.

1193
01:04:42,504 --> 01:04:43,494
I understand that.

1194
01:04:44,047 --> 01:04:45,333
I won't tell anyone.

1195
01:04:45,507 --> 01:04:47,293
You understand nothing.

1196
01:04:47,467 --> 01:04:48,673
And the audience...

1197
01:04:48,843 --> 01:04:50,880
...doesn't understand.
It's one of those moments...

1198
01:04:51,054 --> 01:04:53,591
...that you'll find out the truth
about who he is.

1199
01:04:53,765 --> 01:04:56,473
Between a father and his child.

1200
01:04:58,645 --> 01:05:00,977
Yeah,
I love this speech. It used to be longer.

1201
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:03,138
And we ended up cutting a bit out of it.

1202
01:05:03,316 --> 01:05:05,557
I think on the deleted scenes
you hear more about it.

1203
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:08,102
Which it was, of course,
not because it wasn't great...

1204
01:05:08,279 --> 01:05:11,362
...I think it was amazing,
but it was one of the things...

1205
01:05:11,533 --> 01:05:12,944
...that less was more.

1206
01:05:13,118 --> 01:05:15,200
The more mystery
we could keep around him...

1207
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:17,236
And we'd never wanna do the villain...

1208
01:05:17,414 --> 01:05:20,122
...that just over-explains
his life and his plans.

1209
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:24,330
So I think we do have the exact amount
that we needed there, I guess, for...

1210
01:05:24,504 --> 01:05:27,917
That's what I thought when I saw it.
I couldn't remember exactly...

1211
01:05:28,091 --> 01:05:30,799
...what was not there,
but I knew there was something.

1212
01:05:30,969 --> 01:05:33,427
But it didn't seem
that it was missing anything.

1213
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:35,428
-Yeah.
-And then I saw the deleted scene.

1214
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:37,760
And I went, "Oh, yeah,
that stuff. That was good too."

1215
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:39,641
It was great.
But at the end of the day...

1216
01:05:39,811 --> 01:05:41,768
...it's like that thing.
He doesn't have...

1217
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:44,555
He doesn't need to talk with her.
He's past all that...

1218
01:05:44,732 --> 01:05:47,815
...like, he explains himself or like...

1219
01:05:47,986 --> 01:05:53,777
I think part of him wants to feel human
and less evil about what he's doing.

1220
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:56,112
That deep inside
he knows that it's a bad thing.

1221
01:05:56,286 --> 01:05:57,651
But he's trying to be...

1222
01:05:57,829 --> 01:06:02,244
He's just, of course, turning a blind eye
on what he's doing.

1223
01:06:02,417 --> 01:06:04,533
That's why I think
he explains himself a bit:

1224
01:06:04,711 --> 01:06:05,917
"Hey, I'm not a monster.

1225
01:06:06,087 --> 01:06:08,704
If you could see
the things that happened to me...

1226
01:06:08,882 --> 01:06:10,498
...like, you'll understand, right?"

1227
01:06:11,176 --> 01:06:13,884
I love Jane's reaction, her acting here...

1228
01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:17,341
...where she kind of, like,
starts putting the pieces together...

1229
01:06:17,515 --> 01:06:19,847
...and realizing what's coming.

1230
01:06:20,518 --> 01:06:21,804
It's really good.

1231
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:24,265
I like this reveal as well.

1232
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:27,897
That's almost kind of silly
but it kind of makes sense, right?

1233
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:33,028
He was laying right on top of the body,
and the Blind Man just struck down and...

1234
01:06:33,198 --> 01:06:35,565
And actually if he...

1235
01:06:35,742 --> 01:06:38,700
There was a longer version of the shot
where you could see that the...

1236
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:45,708
The blade actually scratch his cheek
and his ear and so he missed by nothing.

1237
01:06:47,754 --> 01:06:50,371
Here's the moment of, obviously, Alex...

1238
01:06:50,548 --> 01:06:53,256
...starting to turn into, you know...

1239
01:06:53,927 --> 01:06:58,387
...the different person, like really...
He started doubting himself so much...

1240
01:06:58,556 --> 01:07:00,672
...and being so scared
of everything. And now he's, like...

1241
01:07:01,142 --> 01:07:03,600
He's been through so much that...
Again, like, moral of this character...

1242
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:06,808
...Is he's, like,
ready to do something about it...

1243
01:07:06,981 --> 01:07:11,350
...and not just be
cowering behind shelves.

1244
01:07:11,569 --> 01:07:14,561
He takes a hammer
and he's gonna do something about it.

1245
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:16,571
-Ah, yes...
-Oh, the tar.

1246
01:07:16,741 --> 01:07:19,358
-This famous scene.
-Heh, heh.

1247
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:24,162
Franciska,
the girl that played that character...

1248
01:07:24,332 --> 01:07:26,699
...she really took it.
She had to stay there still.

1249
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:30,460
It was really a black
thick paint to the...

1250
01:07:31,005 --> 01:07:33,997
It was harmless
but still, it was terrible.

1251
01:07:34,175 --> 01:07:37,338
And had to just stay there
and let the paint go up...

1252
01:07:37,512 --> 01:07:39,628
...and not breathe and...

1253
01:07:39,806 --> 01:07:40,967
Because if she blew it...

1254
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:43,598
...doing the whole thing again
was impossible.

1255
01:07:43,768 --> 01:07:47,102
-Yeah, no, she did a yeoman job.
-Yeah.

1256
01:07:47,647 --> 01:07:52,016
I love that the Blind Man has everything
kind of planned ahead of...

1257
01:07:52,193 --> 01:07:55,606
Like, he knew that
if she died, he wasn't gonna go...

1258
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:57,487
...and bury her in the backyard.

1259
01:07:57,657 --> 01:08:00,490
And risking someone seeing him do that.

1260
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:02,742
So he had this plan
to bury her in the cellar.

1261
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:05,370
Or maybe
you could even think that once the...

1262
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:07,781
She gave birth to the child...

1263
01:08:07,959 --> 01:08:10,496
-He'd get rid of the body.
-That's what I thought...

1264
01:08:10,670 --> 01:08:11,660
Yeah.

1265
01:08:11,838 --> 01:08:14,626
...it was gonna be
because he really couldn't release her.

1266
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:16,961
But you never know
what would happen by then...

1267
01:08:17,135 --> 01:08:18,625
...you know? I mean...

1268
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:22,588
Probably he didn't know. I think that...

1269
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:25,097
In that aspect, I think,
because he's such a...

1270
01:08:25,268 --> 01:08:29,057
Emotion is so complex for him,
I think he was trying, you know...

1271
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:31,847
...on the plan to do with her,
trying to figure out...

1272
01:08:32,025 --> 01:08:34,266
...he will cross that bridge
when he gets there.

1273
01:08:34,736 --> 01:08:36,352
It's a joke.

1274
01:08:37,071 --> 01:08:39,483
It's a bad joke.

1275
01:08:40,033 --> 01:08:42,616
You tell me what God would allow...

1276
01:08:42,827 --> 01:08:44,283
Once again, that...

1277
01:08:44,829 --> 01:08:47,537
The audience thinks they know
what's gonna happen.

1278
01:08:48,875 --> 01:08:51,537
They think it's gonna be a rape scene
or some sort of...

1279
01:08:52,170 --> 01:08:53,456
Just gonna be there.

1280
01:08:53,838 --> 01:08:55,579
And the whole motivation
behind everything...

1281
01:08:55,757 --> 01:08:57,998
...all the weirdness,
is that this is gonna follow.

1282
01:08:58,176 --> 01:09:00,964
It was that
it was all for the sake of the character.

1283
01:09:01,387 --> 01:09:03,879
Like, we knew
that the Blind Man being who he was...

1284
01:09:04,057 --> 01:09:07,675
...and having the codes
that he had... Like he says now...

1285
01:09:07,852 --> 01:09:12,016
...I love the line
that, "I'm not a rapist."

1286
01:09:12,190 --> 01:09:15,103
Like, that really put things...

1287
01:09:15,485 --> 01:09:19,479
Gets you thinking about
what he's gonna do now.

1288
01:09:21,908 --> 01:09:22,898
Aah. No. No, no.

1289
01:09:23,076 --> 01:09:25,363
Like I said, what follows that...

1290
01:09:25,828 --> 01:09:28,911
...really was for the sake
of not just being perverted...

1291
01:09:29,082 --> 01:09:30,914
...or doing something super twisty.

1292
01:09:31,084 --> 01:09:34,748
It was just that being who he was...

1293
01:09:34,921 --> 01:09:37,037
...we needed to protect him,
and we didn't wanna have a scene...

1294
01:09:37,215 --> 01:09:40,082
...where he puts his pants down.
He's gonna be an animal.

1295
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:42,170
He would still have his morals.

1296
01:09:42,345 --> 01:09:45,178
And he was gonna do it
in a way that didn't require that.

1297
01:09:45,348 --> 01:09:46,713
Right.

1298
01:09:47,308 --> 01:09:51,017
And, again, for people that are thinking
this is some twisted movie thing...

1299
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:53,975
...that we came up with,
turkey baster in the...

1300
01:09:54,148 --> 01:09:58,062
And the sperm.
It's actually the way you do it.

1301
01:09:58,236 --> 01:10:00,568
It's actually medically accurate.

1302
01:10:00,738 --> 01:10:02,775
If a single mom
wants to have kids at home...

1303
01:10:02,949 --> 01:10:05,407
...they don't wanna go
through the sperm bank and...

1304
01:10:05,576 --> 01:10:06,816
It's still pretty twisted.

1305
01:10:06,994 --> 01:10:10,783
It is, but at home insemination
is the way you do it. It's not...

1306
01:10:10,957 --> 01:10:12,573
I mean, to be honest...

1307
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:14,536
You take a turkey baster
and that's the way you do it.

1308
01:10:14,711 --> 01:10:15,951
It was a twisted idea.

1309
01:10:16,129 --> 01:10:20,748
But it happened to be that
then it was something that occurs.

1310
01:10:20,925 --> 01:10:23,462
That may be
the single most disgusting moment...

1311
01:10:23,636 --> 01:10:25,126
...in the film right there.

1312
01:10:26,639 --> 01:10:29,051
It's so weird. At the end of the day...

1313
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:32,343
...like, it's what we thought
is fascinating about it.

1314
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:35,103
If that was blood and that was a knife...

1315
01:10:35,273 --> 01:10:36,855
...nobody will even flinch.

1316
01:10:37,024 --> 01:10:38,514
-Right.
-They go like, "Ah, whatever."

1317
01:10:38,693 --> 01:10:40,650
"Oh, but it's sperm
in a turkey baster?"

1318
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:43,562
And everybody loses their minds.
Heh, heh.

1319
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:46,698
-And that I don't get.
-I believe there was a hair in...

1320
01:10:46,868 --> 01:10:48,950
-Heh-heh-heh.
-Yeah, there was a hair.

1321
01:10:49,537 --> 01:10:51,369
I remember seeing it with the audience.

1322
01:10:51,539 --> 01:10:52,825
The audience covered their mouth...

1323
01:10:52,999 --> 01:10:55,161
...and getting all grossed out
and I was like:

1324
01:10:55,334 --> 01:10:58,247
"If it was guts and blood,
nobody cares.”

1325
01:10:58,421 --> 01:11:01,880
It is sperm and everybody freaks out.

1326
01:11:02,592 --> 01:11:07,086
I think that's fascinating and it tells
a lot about who we are as a society.

1327
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:09,971
There's something strange about that.

1328
01:11:11,642 --> 01:11:13,633
And nothing actually happened.
Like it's...

1329
01:11:13,811 --> 01:11:16,223
We leave everything
for the audience's imagination.

1330
01:11:16,397 --> 01:11:20,516
Really nothing gets to happen there.
He doesn't really get to do anything.

1331
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:23,185
You know, I saw it
with a room full of journalists.

1332
01:11:23,362 --> 01:11:27,651
And they were reacting
just like a normal audience.

1333
01:11:27,825 --> 01:11:30,487
They were reacting the way you described.

1334
01:11:30,661 --> 01:11:33,369
I love this beat. I remember,
this was not in the script.

1335
01:11:33,539 --> 01:11:34,870
And Fede called me...

1336
01:11:35,041 --> 01:11:38,329
...during the shooting
and said, "Hey, I added this small beat."

1337
01:11:38,503 --> 01:11:40,369
-Oh, the upcoming one?
-Where she... Yeah.

1338
01:11:40,546 --> 01:11:43,789
Where she grabs the turkey baster
and stick it in his mouth.

1339
01:11:44,842 --> 01:11:47,800
-Yeah, see, I'll tell you what, baby...
-And this is all... This is all you, Slang.

1340
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:52,055
Just because I was... I don't even know
how I dared to ask you to do that and...

1341
01:11:52,225 --> 01:11:54,512
But I did and I was...
I was 100 percent...

1342
01:11:54,685 --> 01:11:58,895
I had so many answers prepared
for when you were gonna say no to me.

1343
01:11:59,065 --> 01:12:01,147
I was like,
"I know he's gonna say, 'No way.

1344
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:02,682
I'm not gonna do that
because it's not in the script."

1345
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:04,396
Then suddenly out of nowhere...

1346
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:06,902
...when I'm about to roll out
my list of answers...

1347
01:12:07,073 --> 01:12:09,440
...why you should do it,
as soon as I told you, you go:

1348
01:12:09,617 --> 01:12:13,702
"Yeah, bring it, let's do it." Heh, heh.
Which I thought it was funny.

1349
01:12:13,871 --> 01:12:15,407
-Well, you know...
-You did it...

1350
01:12:15,581 --> 01:12:20,747
It's like that old saying, you know,
"Suck one turkey baster," you know?

1351
01:12:21,212 --> 01:12:25,331
But I guess it is her revenge,
and she deserves it. I think...

1352
01:12:25,508 --> 01:12:28,091
And it's like watching it
with a female audience is...

1353
01:12:28,261 --> 01:12:31,970
They definitely, after suffering
that moment of just pain...

1354
01:12:32,139 --> 01:12:35,052
And what they thought
was gonna happen didn't happen...

1355
01:12:35,226 --> 01:12:39,390
...I think, it's a great payback,
and deserved payback on her side.

1356
01:12:39,564 --> 01:12:42,181
To give it to him
and see him doing that...

1357
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:44,975
...as much as it's hilarious
and weird and funny it is...

1358
01:12:45,152 --> 01:12:47,234
...I think it's a deserved moment...

1359
01:12:47,405 --> 01:12:50,193
...for the audience,
just to get that payback, so...

1360
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:54,576
It's totally earned is what it is,
I think. And that makes it just fine.

1361
01:12:56,706 --> 01:12:58,788
-Okay.
-This one.

1362
01:12:58,958 --> 01:12:59,948
Let's get out of here.

1363
01:13:00,126 --> 01:13:02,242
I think here, again, one moment...

1364
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:06,835
...you suspect that it may be over but
the music is not giving you anything...

1365
01:13:07,008 --> 01:13:09,124
...the audience knows
that this is not over.

1366
01:13:09,302 --> 01:13:14,342
If the music was playing
a refreshing, you know, conclusive tune...

1367
01:13:14,515 --> 01:13:17,883
...you might think it's gone. But it's
not. You know, something's gonna...

1368
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:20,051
It's just amazing that you take him out.

1369
01:13:21,439 --> 01:13:25,854
Yes, the audience think it's gonna be her,
ironically. I think a lot of people...

1370
01:13:26,027 --> 01:13:28,815
They know someone's gonna die
because the music is not playing.

1371
01:13:28,988 --> 01:13:32,652
And they're just at the door
just looking over their shoulder.

1372
01:13:32,825 --> 01:13:35,283
And there has been enough time
with the movie...

1373
01:13:35,703 --> 01:13:37,614
...to know
that something's gonna happen.

1374
01:13:37,788 --> 01:13:41,452
But they don't know who is gonna die,
who is gonna come out.

1375
01:13:44,462 --> 01:13:46,248
Here's one of those moments that you...

1376
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:48,538
You're begging for her to run
as fast as she can.

1377
01:13:52,678 --> 01:13:56,512
And this is... You can see it in her eyes,
this is really the end of the shooting.

1378
01:13:56,682 --> 01:13:59,970
And this is probably
the last two days of shooting.

1379
01:14:00,144 --> 01:14:02,886
And she's exhausted,
and she's been through so much.

1380
01:14:03,814 --> 01:14:06,681
And it really reflects
what's going on in the story.

1381
01:14:06,859 --> 01:14:08,190
-And here comes the dog.
-Heh.

1382
01:14:16,410 --> 01:14:17,400
Shit.

1383
01:14:17,578 --> 01:14:20,821
Again, this is another
nice transition between Detroit...

1384
01:14:21,165 --> 01:14:23,247
...and this is Budapest, actually.

1385
01:14:23,626 --> 01:14:25,458
-Is it?
-Yeah, we changed countries...

1386
01:14:25,628 --> 01:14:28,916
...just like that.
That's the beginning of the shooting.

1387
01:14:31,092 --> 01:14:33,424
That's Detroit. That's Budapest, sorry.

1388
01:14:33,594 --> 01:14:35,551
-Of course.
-So, yeah. She goes over the fence.

1389
01:14:35,721 --> 01:14:37,553
We have the same fence
in one country and the other.

1390
01:14:37,723 --> 01:14:40,090
And we managed to do that stitch.

1391
01:14:43,562 --> 01:14:45,473
That was completely different, right?

1392
01:14:45,648 --> 01:14:46,979
Originally in the script.

1393
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:49,766
This wasn't like this.
This came out later.

1394
01:14:50,903 --> 01:14:53,190
I think this might have been my first...

1395
01:14:54,865 --> 01:14:56,822
Actually this is...
You're completely right.

1396
01:14:56,993 --> 01:15:00,452
This is actually the first moment
you showed up on set.

1397
01:15:10,589 --> 01:15:11,795
This scene must...

1398
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:16,418
It was definitely the most complex scene
for me to shoot in the whole movie.

1399
01:15:16,595 --> 01:15:19,633
And we actually...
It was an ongoing thing.

1400
01:15:19,807 --> 01:15:23,471
It was... I think there wasn't...

1401
01:15:23,686 --> 01:15:26,303
Basically there was...
Every week almost...

1402
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:31,312
...of the shooting of this movie,
out of the 45 days of shooting...

1403
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:34,565
...like, there was every five days,
something like that...

1404
01:15:34,739 --> 01:15:37,401
...we were coming back
to this car to pick something up.

1405
01:15:37,575 --> 01:15:41,785
Because it was so complex and so
tricky to get it to move around the car.

1406
01:15:41,996 --> 01:15:46,285
And most importantly, it was so tricky
to get the dog to do things he had to do.

1407
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:49,913
Because Jane was doing her job
fantastically as you can see right here.

1408
01:15:50,129 --> 01:15:52,336
But the dog was so...

1409
01:15:52,506 --> 01:15:56,465
It was so demanding for the dog,
and so we were constantly coming back.

1410
01:15:56,635 --> 01:16:00,344
And during the making of the movie,
there was always a second unit...

1411
01:16:00,514 --> 01:16:02,801
...like adding shots to this sequence...

1412
01:16:02,975 --> 01:16:05,057
...which I think
makes it complete at the end.

1413
01:16:05,227 --> 01:16:07,184
-It works so well for me.
-Yeah.

1414
01:16:07,646 --> 01:16:10,559
But it was very, very demanding.
It was actually two cars.

1415
01:16:10,733 --> 01:16:13,225
One of the cars was cut in half.

1416
01:16:13,402 --> 01:16:15,814
And in order to get the camera in there.

1417
01:16:16,030 --> 01:16:18,112
This is actually the half car.

1418
01:16:22,536 --> 01:16:24,368
My God.
You know the Blind Man's coming.

1419
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:26,742
Like, the audience knows
the Blind Man's coming.

1420
01:16:26,916 --> 01:16:28,907
Whatever she's gonna do,
she better be fast.

1421
01:16:29,085 --> 01:16:32,874
-Yeah, but she's so intrepid, you know?
-Yeah.

1422
01:16:35,382 --> 01:16:38,625
The dog is around,
so there's no way to come out.

1423
01:16:39,512 --> 01:16:42,425
One of those tricky puzzles.

1424
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:45,056
And this is actually, um...

1425
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:48,350
We were trying to figure out
how she was gonna come out of the car.

1426
01:16:48,521 --> 01:16:50,558
And what was the thing
she was going to do.

1427
01:16:50,731 --> 01:16:54,269
And because we changed this
from originally what was in the script...

1428
01:16:54,819 --> 01:16:56,275
...and in pre-production and...

1429
01:16:56,445 --> 01:17:00,985
And I remember it was Mathew Hart,
the line producer on this movie...

1430
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:04,067
...looking at the car,
and all of us scratching our heads...

1431
01:17:04,286 --> 01:17:08,200
...looking at the car and trying to figure
out how to come out of this situation...

1432
01:17:08,415 --> 01:17:10,873
...If we were Rocky. And he said...

1433
01:17:11,585 --> 01:17:16,421
And Mathew came out
with the idea of, "What about this cord?"

1434
01:17:17,174 --> 01:17:19,415
Basically the whole idea
of like, at the end...

1435
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:23,879
...using the cord to trap the dog
inside the house, inside the car.

1436
01:17:27,393 --> 01:17:29,885
-This was...
-This is where the scene gets gnarly.

1437
01:17:30,104 --> 01:17:31,094
Yeah.

1438
01:17:31,313 --> 01:17:33,896
Because that was all real,
like that was real, like...

1439
01:17:34,483 --> 01:17:37,976
But it was so tricky to do,
the punching the face, the click...

1440
01:17:38,654 --> 01:17:41,362
Did the dog actually
get that close to her?

1441
01:17:42,491 --> 01:17:46,826
No, no, I think the...
The side shot is a composition of shots.

1442
01:17:46,996 --> 01:17:50,159
But, yes, there was a stunt double,
which was the owner of the dog.

1443
01:17:50,332 --> 01:17:54,075
And it was this woman
in some of those shots.

1444
01:17:54,253 --> 01:17:56,039
There's a combination of many things.

1445
01:17:56,213 --> 01:17:58,375
And actually if you take a close look...

1446
01:17:58,549 --> 01:18:02,213
Oh, there you go. That's your
first moment he has in the movie.

1447
01:18:02,428 --> 01:18:05,420
I think this one here's actually,
the punch.

1448
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:08,048
And the cut to this moment here.

1449
01:18:10,728 --> 01:18:12,184
And, uh...

1450
01:18:12,521 --> 01:18:16,105
-And back at the beginning.
-Back at the beginning of the film.

1451
01:18:16,859 --> 01:18:19,476
Which is one of those strange things
where, you know...

1452
01:18:20,321 --> 01:18:22,187
...even though you start there...

1453
01:18:22,406 --> 01:18:25,023
...the audience tends to forget about
those openings.

1454
01:18:25,201 --> 01:18:28,990
But they've been through so much,
the ones that are overthinking it...

1455
01:18:29,163 --> 01:18:31,154
...maybe they remember,
but a lot forget.

1456
01:18:31,373 --> 01:18:33,831
Then suddenly, you're back there.
And you go, "Yeah.

1457
01:18:34,001 --> 01:18:35,912
-Right, exactly.
-They told me about it.

1458
01:18:36,086 --> 01:18:38,703
I should have known better.
She was gonna get caught.”

1459
01:18:38,881 --> 01:18:40,087
It's elegant.

1460
01:18:42,384 --> 01:18:44,466
And this,
this is definitely one of those...

1461
01:18:44,678 --> 01:18:47,511
...moments that we got so lucky
on the shooting.

1462
01:18:47,681 --> 01:18:50,469
Like, again, very hot day.

1463
01:18:50,643 --> 01:18:54,136
The wrangler showed up,
and he had just one ladybug.

1464
01:18:54,313 --> 01:18:56,179
Just literally one ladybug and I...

1465
01:18:56,357 --> 01:18:59,395
And completely determined
to not do a CG ladybug...

1466
01:18:59,568 --> 01:19:02,731
...because I didn't do it at the
beginning, I wasn't gonna do it now.

1467
01:19:02,905 --> 01:19:06,318
And he puts the ladybug on her hand,
and does the perfect thing...

1468
01:19:06,492 --> 01:19:08,233
...that spread the wings...

1469
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:10,447
...and flies away
like right in front of us.

1470
01:19:10,621 --> 01:19:12,077
But the first time he did it...

1471
01:19:12,248 --> 01:19:14,205
...the ladybug did it, we weren't rolling.

1472
01:19:14,375 --> 01:19:17,493
Did it so fast, and we didn't roll on it,
and we lost the ladybug.

1473
01:19:17,711 --> 01:19:20,794
And then it was everybody in the room
trying to find the ladybug.

1474
01:19:20,965 --> 01:19:22,956
And someone finds it on the drapes...

1475
01:19:23,842 --> 01:19:26,379
...takes it, put it back in the hand,
and it happens.

1476
01:19:26,553 --> 01:19:28,920
And we managed to get
that beautiful shot.

1477
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:34,099
No! Aah!

1478
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:36,181
Don't!

1479
01:19:40,901 --> 01:19:44,269
Again, I can't help
but feel pity for the Blind Man now.

1480
01:19:44,488 --> 01:19:48,152
Like, it's one of those,
you know he's done.

1481
01:19:48,367 --> 01:19:52,452
If he cannot hear anything,
like, that'd be very hard for him...

1482
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:53,702
...to get her.

1483
01:19:53,872 --> 01:19:58,082
And Rogue music,
Roque Banos' score like starts...

1484
01:19:58,294 --> 01:20:01,628
Now this is all...
This was all pretty freewheeling here.

1485
01:20:01,839 --> 01:20:02,829
This was all...

1486
01:20:03,007 --> 01:20:05,749
Remember the camera.
We didn't have a...

1487
01:20:05,968 --> 01:20:07,333
Yeah.

1488
01:20:08,262 --> 01:20:11,175
We had a blueprint,
but, uh, kind of making it up...

1489
01:20:11,348 --> 01:20:14,340
-Yeah.
-...as we went into shooting.

1490
01:20:17,313 --> 01:20:19,350
-Here she comes.
-Yeah.

1491
01:20:20,274 --> 01:20:24,142
There was again, I think in the script,
there was many versions of this ending.

1492
01:20:25,321 --> 01:20:28,780
Because it was hard for us morally
to understand what was...

1493
01:20:28,991 --> 01:20:32,780
To really find an answer to
what was the right thing to do...

1494
01:20:32,953 --> 01:20:34,318
...and how the movie should end.

1495
01:20:34,955 --> 01:20:38,289
Because we thought that if he died,
the audience might feel bad about it...

1496
01:20:38,459 --> 01:20:40,416
...like strangely being such a...
You know...

1497
01:20:40,586 --> 01:20:44,250
...being a guy that did something so
terrible. Still, just dying like that...

1498
01:20:44,465 --> 01:20:47,207
...in his house
was something that felt wrong.

1499
01:20:48,761 --> 01:20:52,425
But most importantly what was
the thing that we really changed...

1500
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:55,677
...in the script many times,
and it was...

1501
01:20:55,851 --> 01:20:58,969
-...if she was gonna get away with it or not.
-Mm.

1502
01:20:59,146 --> 01:21:02,935
I don't know if you notice that, but I
love how you can see the glare in his eyes.

1503
01:21:03,108 --> 01:21:07,443
You can see a couple spots of light that
kind of tells you he might not be dead.

1504
01:21:07,613 --> 01:21:09,229
It's gorgeous.

1505
01:21:09,406 --> 01:21:12,023
-Little pin pricks of light.
-Yeah.

1506
01:21:13,786 --> 01:21:15,993
And here in this moment,
there used to be...

1507
01:21:16,163 --> 01:21:18,951
One of the endings
that I still like was that she...

1508
01:21:19,124 --> 01:21:22,082
That was in the script
that we never shot that she heard...

1509
01:21:22,252 --> 01:21:25,335
...the sirens of the cars, of the cops,
but they were gonna be closer.

1510
01:21:25,506 --> 01:21:27,918
You're gonna see lights
coming through the windows.

1511
01:21:28,133 --> 01:21:30,716
I mean, not the lights.
You will notice the cars outside.

1512
01:21:30,886 --> 01:21:34,880
And what she would do is she will take
the money, and put it back in the safe.

1513
01:21:35,099 --> 01:21:38,387
And that was the only way to get saved.
She wasn't taking the money.

1514
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:41,518
There was no way to prove
that she was trying to steal anything.

1515
01:21:41,688 --> 01:21:43,679
And she was trying to get away with that.

1516
01:21:43,857 --> 01:21:46,690
But it was one of those
that we felt it wasn't realistic...

1517
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:50,148
...or even if that happened,
it would have been very complicated.

1518
01:21:50,322 --> 01:21:52,484
So at the end,
we said, like, "Okay, she's gonna...

1519
01:21:52,658 --> 01:21:56,071
We're not gonna do a Hollywood ending
where she gives back the money."

1520
01:21:56,245 --> 01:21:59,909
Which was in the script. There was
a version where she went to the police...

1521
01:22:00,082 --> 01:22:01,993
...and gave back the money. Yeah.

1522
01:22:02,167 --> 01:22:06,126
I think at the end, we decided that
this was gonna be some sort of pact...

1523
01:22:06,338 --> 01:22:07,453
...between criminals...

1524
01:22:07,631 --> 01:22:11,169
...when she learns that the guy is...
The Blind Man is still alive.

1525
01:22:11,343 --> 01:22:14,881
And the Blind Man
is not saying anything about the money.

1526
01:22:15,055 --> 01:22:18,298
And she got away with the money,
it's like a pact between them.

1527
01:22:18,475 --> 01:22:19,715
They're gonna be...

1528
01:22:19,893 --> 01:22:23,477
They're gonna keep that secret,
and they're gonna be safe.

1529
01:22:23,647 --> 01:22:28,858
Well, it would be a huge disappointment
if she didn't keep the money.

1530
01:22:29,027 --> 01:22:30,142
Heh. Yeah, of course.

1531
01:22:30,362 --> 01:22:32,603
I mean, for everyone.

1532
01:22:32,781 --> 01:22:35,990
-I mean, including the viewer, I think.
-Yeah.

1533
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:37,650
You know. I... Yeah, the money.

1534
01:22:37,870 --> 01:22:41,488
I mean, everything would have been
completely meaningless...

1535
01:22:41,665 --> 01:22:44,828
...if she didn't have the money,
because it becomes about her sister.

1536
01:22:45,002 --> 01:22:48,370
It becomes about the dream of California.

1537
01:22:48,547 --> 01:22:50,037
-Yeah.
-And it becomes...

1538
01:22:50,215 --> 01:22:54,129
Now becomes about
the possibility of the sequel.

1539
01:22:54,845 --> 01:22:57,462
Yeah, but here I love this moment.
They're like so eerie.

1540
01:22:57,639 --> 01:23:00,927
Like, you don't... Even though
it looks like a happy ending...

1541
01:23:01,101 --> 01:23:04,184
...like, story-wise. It definitely doesn't
look like a happy ending.

1542
01:23:04,354 --> 01:23:06,641
-We thought that...
-She's leaving with the money.

1543
01:23:06,815 --> 01:23:08,772
And with her sister.
Everything seems well.

1544
01:23:08,942 --> 01:23:13,186
But, oh, you know
she's never gonna sleep well anymore.

1545
01:23:13,363 --> 01:23:15,400
Yeah, she knows
she's a criminal from now on.

1546
01:23:15,574 --> 01:23:18,407
Remember when we shot the, um...

1547
01:23:19,036 --> 01:23:21,619
-The Blind Man in the train station?
-Yeah, yeah.

1548
01:23:21,788 --> 01:23:24,246
Actually that shot, if that continued...

1549
01:23:24,416 --> 01:23:28,284
...you were gonna show up in there,
you'd see the Blind Man behind her.

1550
01:23:28,462 --> 01:23:30,794
You were never gonna see the face.
It was one of the things...

1551
01:23:30,964 --> 01:23:33,376
...you might think it was him or not.

1552
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:37,293
But I'm happy with the end
the way it is that you know there...

1553
01:23:38,222 --> 01:23:42,716
There's a price she's gonna pay
that she's never gonna be at peace.

1554
01:23:42,935 --> 01:23:46,223
And she knows that
that guy is alive, and who knows?

1555
01:23:46,396 --> 01:23:48,137
He might go after her someday.

1556
01:23:50,859 --> 01:23:53,100
This is the title sequence
I personally designed.

1557
01:23:53,278 --> 01:23:55,360
-I love it.
-I did it, I just...

1558
01:23:55,531 --> 01:23:59,274
I didn't wanna have black titles against...
You know, white titles against black.

1559
01:23:59,451 --> 01:24:03,536
-And I created this sequence.
-No, it's totally cool.

1560
01:24:03,705 --> 01:24:08,620
Just to revisit the places in the house
that we spent so much time in.

1561
01:24:10,879 --> 01:24:13,917
Well, and that concludes this commentary.

1562
01:24:14,091 --> 01:24:17,004
-Thanks so much, guys.
-Thanks for watching.
