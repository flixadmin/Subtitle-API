1
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:43,590
<i>There he is!</i>

2
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,020
<i>Oh, sorry.</i>

3
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,190
<i>Superman, Superman,
can we ask you some questions?</i>

4
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:49,860
<i>It's for our podcast.</i>

5
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,600
Well, in that case...

6
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,200
<i>How many people that
you saved... Have you saved?</i>

7
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,530
- I...
<i>- Never mind.</i>

8
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:56,500
<i>Does your thing
really stand for hope?</i>

9
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,600
Yes. It does.

10
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:59,100
<i>But it looks like an "S."</i>

11
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:01,410
Yes. It's meant to. It's...

12
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,840
It's meant to wind like a river.

13
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,710
It comes and goes. My...

14
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:10,980
A man I knew used to say that
hope is like your car keys.

15
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:14,650
Easy to lose, but if you dig
around, it's usually close by.

16
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,890
<i>Did you ever fight a hippo?</i>

17
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,320
<i>No. Shh. That's dumb.</i>

18
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:19,960
<i>But hippos are the most deadly.</i>

19
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,930
<i>What's the best thing
about Planet Earth?</i>

20
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:25,130
Hmm...

21
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,650
What are you doing?

22
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:58,460
No, wait. No, wait. Wait. Wait!

23
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,560
Please! Please, man. Please!

24
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,670
What do you want from me?

25
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,000
Fear.

26
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,400
<i>They can smell it.</i>

27
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,800
What the hell?

28
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,210
- What was that?
- A scout.

29
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:26,610
From space?

30
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,550
<i>Like an alien army?</i>

31
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,450
<i>Alfred, are you seeing this?</i>

32
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:33,790
<i>I am.
Matches the other sightings.</i>

33
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:36,990
And that pattern
is all over Luthor's notes.

34
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:39,420
Prep the jet.
We're going north tonight.

35
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,560
Good. It's time, then.

36
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:46,230
It's 'cause
they know he's dead, right?

37
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,300
Superman.

38
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,010
He's gone.

39
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,510
<i>Where does that leave us?</i>

40
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,760
Drop your guns now!

41
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,760
Excuse me.

42
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,030
Go!

43
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,540
Move it! Move! Move!

44
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:15,040
Get down!

45
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,240
Line them up along the wall!

46
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,610
Keep them quiet!

47
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,020
<i>Children, stay close to me.</i>

48
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,210
Who are you?

49
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:56,220
The Lasso of Hestia compels
you to reveal the truth.

50
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,020
Now, who are you?

51
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:02,090
We're a small group
of reactionary terrorists.

52
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:04,460
We know that sin has brought
on this plague of aliens.

53
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,920
Why the hostages?

54
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:08,530
You're too late.

55
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:10,500
The countdown's already begun.

56
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:15,330
In a few minutes, four city
blocks...

57
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,140
While the world watches.

58
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,510
<i>Hush!</i>

59
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,610
Shut up!

60
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:24,910
This is man's best hope.

61
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:27,310
Down with the modern world.

62
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:31,880
Back to the Dark Ages,
and the safety of holy fear.

63
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,690
<i>Quiet!</i>

64
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,960
This would've been
over quickly, but...

65
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,400
No! Don't!

66
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,190
I don't believe it.

67
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:42,320
What are you?

68
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,590
A believer.

69
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:23,560
<i>I'm asking for your help.</i>

70
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:28,330
I believe there is a stranger who
comes to this village from the sea.

71
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:31,910
He comes in the winter when the
people are hungry and brings fish.

72
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:35,110
<i>He comes on the king tide.</i>

73
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,840
That was last night.

74
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:46,550
Icebergs in the harbor, four months
since the last ship got through.

75
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:50,390
Well, this stranger
doesn't come by ship.

76
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:55,300
There are enemies coming
from far away.

77
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,800
I need warriors.

78
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,630
I'm building an alliance
to defend ourselves.

79
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:06,240
Look, I'll give you $25,000
to talk to this man right now.

80
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,710
Outside.

81
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,370
Tell me what those three boxes
are and I'll make it $30,000.

82
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,000
You should get out.

83
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,480
Can you at least point me
to Atlantis?

84
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:43,910
Arthur Curry.

85
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:52,790
Also known as
Protector of the Oceans.

86
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,460
The Aquaman.

87
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,790
I hear you can talk to fish.

88
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,260
So let me get this straight.

89
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:07,030
You do it dressed like a bat?
Like an actual bat?

90
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,970
It's worked for 20 years
in Gotham.

91
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:10,870
Oh, that shithole.

92
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,840
When the fight comes,
we'll need you.

93
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,640
- Don't count on it, Batman.
- Why not?

94
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,240
'Cause I don't like
you coming here,

95
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,040
digging into my business
and getting into my life.

96
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,780
People from Atlantis tell me,
"Do this."

97
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,250
Now you say, "Do that."

98
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,980
- I wanna be left alone.
- Is that why you help

99
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,920
these people out here
in the middle of nowhere?

100
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,550
'Cause you can just leave?

101
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:29,050
I help them 'cause
no one else does.

102
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,720
If you want to protect them,
you need to work with me.

103
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,520
"Strong man is strongest alone."

104
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:34,930
You ever heard that?

105
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:36,460
That's not a saying.

106
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,560
That's the opposite
of what the saying is.

107
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:40,300
Yeah.

108
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,770
<i>Doesn't mean I'm wrong.</i>

109
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,270
You ever hear of Superman?

110
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:46,270
He died fighting next to me.

111
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,440
My point exactly.

112
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,910
What's in the three boxes?

113
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,250
It's ancient history.

114
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,450
What is it?

115
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:56,010
Mankind's melting
the polar ice caps,

116
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,320
destroying the ecosystem.
They got it coming?

117
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,950
Hey, I don't mind
if the oceans rise.

118
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,320
How about if they boil?

119
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:05,890
Dressed like a bat.

120
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,830
You're out of your mind,
Bruce Wayne.

121
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,570
Doesn't mean I'm wrong.

122
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:28,850
So you say you have no way of
reconnecting with this Aquaman?

123
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:32,520
Oh, I put a tracking device in his
coat, but he left without it.

124
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,120
May, in fact,
not have been his coat.

125
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,560
Those squares
from Luthor's notes.

126
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,830
I think they must be
containers of some kind.

127
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,190
Of what?

128
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,300
I don't know. Money. Power.

129
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,600
Something worth starting
a war over.

130
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,070
Well, we've had luck with one
person on the team list.

131
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:57,280
Barry Allen of Central City.

132
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,310
He's completely off the grid.

133
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:02,750
Squatting, I think.
Moves suddenly and often.

134
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,150
Disappearing act.

135
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:06,520
<i>But he does visit his father.</i>

136
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,390
In prison for murdering
his mother.

137
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:11,160
Jesus.

138
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,120
<i>Young Barry always
protested his father's innocence.</i>

139
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:15,230
<i>But he was nine
and nobody listened to him.</i>

140
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,760
We have somebody at the prison?

141
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,900
<i>Oh, yeah.
We'll find the address.</i>

142
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,330
What about, uh, Diana?

143
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,770
Well, you have her number.

144
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,340
What, you could've called her.

145
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:30,540
Oh! Perhaps I should fly to
Paris with a handwritten note.

146
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:34,250
"Will you be Bruce's teammate?
Check yes or no."

147
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,450
I'm only interested
in her skill set.

148
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:39,320
- I'm sure you are.
- Can we?

149
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,890
Ah, well, facial recognition's
a bit dodgy on this one.

150
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:44,820
But they've got a partial match.

151
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,520
A Victor Stone.

152
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:51,930
Genius IQ, football scholarship
to GCU, and deceased.

153
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:53,000
Figures.

154
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,030
Fairy tales and ghost stories.

155
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,970
One misses the days when one's biggest
concerns were exploding wind-up penguins.

156
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:01,310
The simple life.

157
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,740
I don't recognize this world.

158
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,250
I don't have to recognize it.

159
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,250
I just have to save it.

160
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:19,420
Here to see Henry Allen.

161
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:20,620
Sign.

162
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:26,630
Hurry it up, will you?

163
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:31,470
What, you got a problem?

164
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,710
No, there's no problem.

165
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:35,980
Better not be.

166
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,450
You know where to go.

167
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,630
Are those prescription?

168
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,530
Or are you just trying
to look brainy?

169
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:02,770
Because you're holding
yourself back.

170
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:04,370
You're going in circles.

171
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:06,470
You're working three dead-end
jobs, going on four.

172
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,070
Where do you even have the time?

173
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,640
- I make the time.
- And this is all to pay

174
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,440
for a criminal justice
degree, huh?

175
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,910
Okay, I really don't wanna
talk about this again.

176
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:15,680
The investigation was botched.

177
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,680
Give me your hand, man.

178
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:26,690
I want you to listen to me,
Barry, because I mean this.

179
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,760
I want you to give all that up.

180
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:36,100
And I want you to stop
coming to see me.

181
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,240
I am a drag on your life.

182
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,580
Please don't ever say
that to me again.

183
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:47,540
Please?

184
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,050
You can be whatever
you want to be.

185
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,380
You're brilliant, man.

186
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,890
Absolute best of the best.

187
00:17:55,890 --> 00:18:00,690
I can't sit here and watch you
run in place in Central City

188
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:05,730
for some old dude
who is not going anywhere.

189
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:07,600
- Dad, that's not true.
<i>- It's time.</i>

190
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,070
- That's not true.
- Let's go, Allen. Allen!

191
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,700
I want you to make
your own future.

192
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,840
You're living in the past.
Make your own future.

193
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,970
Open gate.

194
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,270
Lab's all yours, Howard.

195
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:41,830
11:30.

196
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,200
Early night for you, Silas.

197
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,810
Yes. Early.

198
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,840
I never got to say...

199
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,310
I'm very sorry
about what happened.

200
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,720
Victor was a wonderful kid.

201
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,450
Thank you.

202
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,100
Victor.

203
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,100
Victor, you're not stuck
up here.

204
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,110
You can have a life.
You can have more than...

205
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:25,080
If you stay up here brooding...

206
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,780
I'm processing.

207
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:29,280
I can access everything.

208
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,180
But I can't put it all together.

209
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:34,220
Not yet. But if you worked with me,
if we had the change engine...

210
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:37,190
So you'd do to someone
else what you did to me?

211
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,520
No.

212
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:41,530
The box stays hidden.

213
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:43,590
If you could see
what we're learning

214
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,400
from the Kryptonian ship... I think the change
engine could integrate with its energy,

215
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,340
- get it powered up and...
- Does anybody know?

216
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:52,600
- What?
- At the lab.

217
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,370
Does anybody know I'm alive?

218
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:57,010
I...

219
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:58,680
didn't think you were ready
for them to...

220
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,540
To what?

221
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,250
For them to see the monster?

222
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,750
You are not a monster.

223
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,220
It's weird that you thought
I meant me.

224
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,720
What I did...

225
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:17,090
I lost your mother
in that accident.

226
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,330
I wasn't about to...

227
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:22,170
I couldn't bear to lose my son.

228
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:24,470
But you did.

229
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:28,670
I got a language in my head
that I don't speak.

230
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:32,140
It's not just digital.
It's alien.

231
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,510
Every day, I wake up different.

232
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,750
Modified.

233
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:40,550
How do you...

234
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:48,360
Couldn't do that last night.

235
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:51,860
Ever since we got visitors
from Krypton,

236
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:54,470
people have been waiting
for the next alien invasion.

237
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,710
Now I gotta wonder if I'm it.

238
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,980
Any changes today?

239
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,420
No, my Queen.

240
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,790
The Mother Box has awoken,
yet nothing has happened.

241
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:27,530
It has slept for thousands of
years, since the First Age.

242
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,630
Why did it wake at all?

243
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,440
Amazons! On your mark!

244
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,750
Yes, soldiers! Fight on!

245
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:51,980
Ready!

246
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,400
Steppenwolf.

247
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:11,130
<i>Mother.</i>

248
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:14,710
Millennia in exile, searching...

249
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:18,580
At last you call me home.

250
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:21,250
You will not like your welcome.

251
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:23,620
Oh, I think I will.

252
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:30,120
Steady!

253
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,890
Forward!

254
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,470
Gather the legions!

255
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,170
You must seal the cage!

256
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,740
Go!

257
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,080
Flank right!

258
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,590
Yes.

259
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,350
Run.

260
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:04,260
Seal the gates!

261
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:27,950
Keep it moving.

262
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,880
Got it! Go!

263
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,050
Enough.

264
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:57,070
Noble Queen, why do you fight?

265
00:25:57,070 --> 00:26:01,100
After the unity,
you will join my legion

266
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:05,080
and you will know
the righteousness of power.

267
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,150
You will love me.

268
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,030
You all will.

269
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:50,220
We have to light the ancient
warning fire.

270
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:53,790
The fire has not burned
for 5,000 years.

271
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:55,900
Men won't know what it means.

272
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,860
Men won't.

273
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:00,970
She will.

274
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,320
Listen to me, Diana.

275
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,440
What did you
do this weekend, Diana?

276
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,940
- Me?
- Yeah.

277
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,900
Nothing very interesting.

278
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,980
That's all you ever tell us.

279
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:47,280
What can I say,
I'm not that exciting.

280
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,410
<i>...so-called
shrine of the Amazons,</i>

281
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:53,180
<i>an enormous bonfire burned
right behind me,</i>

282
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:58,790
<i>baffling absolutely everyone from
locals to government authorities alike.</i>

283
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:01,660
<i>The fire could be seen
for miles on end.</i>

284
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:03,960
Invasion.

285
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:07,970
<i>On the local scene, this janitor's
wife had some strong words</i>

286
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:11,670
<i>for the aliens she says
stole her man.</i>

287
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:15,840
<i>My Howard is a good man.
He's a provider.</i>

288
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:19,710
<i>And these aliens
are gonna... probe him?</i>

289
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:25,050
<i>Come down to the Lakeview, and I'll stick
a... probe up your alien... you...</i>

290
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:28,450
I found a little
place. By the diner.

291
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:29,890
Suits me just fine.

292
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:31,350
I wish you'd said something.

293
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,620
Oh, no.
I got behind in the payments.

294
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:37,360
And you know the banks jump like
a cougar if you miss by a dime.

295
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,330
Place was too big
for me, anyway.

296
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:42,500
Shuffling around
like an old ghost.

297
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,940
Well, I might've been able
to talk to someone, or...

298
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,470
You had enough to deal with.

299
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:49,270
Don't need to add
"mother-in-law" to the list.

300
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,940
Not that I was ever...

301
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,380
<i>Hey, Lane.</i>

302
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:58,480
Who was your source,
the activist in that university?

303
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,950
Well, it's my source.

304
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:02,820
<i>I got tapped
for the kidnapping story.</i>

305
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,550
There were all
those student protests.

306
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,020
Anyway, I'm thinking
it's political.

307
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:08,090
<i>So, who's your guy?</i>

308
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:10,030
Well, I'll see
if she'll take your call.

309
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:13,800
So it's a she. Hmm.

310
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:16,340
It's not a she.

311
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,740
Sounds like you should be
working that story.

312
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:22,010
I'm...

313
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:24,910
I'm not ready yet.

314
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:27,140
I'm perfectly happy
doing fluff pieces

315
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:28,850
about kitten grooming.

316
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:30,820
For a while.

317
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:34,820
It was hard coming back
here at all.

318
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:38,460
Well, I can hardly read
the news, anyway.

319
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,430
So much bitterness.

320
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:43,460
Of course I think it's all
because he's gone.

321
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,300
But I suppose a mother does.

322
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,470
But it's not like there's any
less that needs reporting.

323
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:55,610
And Clark promised me you were
gonna bring home another Pulitzer.

324
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:57,780
- Oh, did he?
- Oh, yes. He did.

325
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:01,410
He said that you were the thirstiest
young woman that he'd ever met.

326
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:05,080
Hungriest.

327
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:08,190
Hungriest... Yeah.

328
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:12,490
He said you could smell a story
further away than he could hear.

329
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:18,360
Well, stories just made sense.

330
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:20,960
It was more than just a puzzle.

331
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:23,470
It was about the truth.

332
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:27,440
It was about seeing the engine
of the world.

333
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,780
When it still ran.

334
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:41,050
<i>Victor Stone. Deceased.</i>

335
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:25,330
That one.

336
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:27,600
Pretty sure that's what made
the alien go crazy.

337
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,030
<i>I'll see about rigging
something for the suit.</i>

338
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,170
<i>Won't be quick.</i>

339
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:32,490
Anything that can
give me an edge.

340
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:48,250
You know, I paid millions of dollars
for this building's security.

341
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:50,020
Yeah, it looked expensive.

342
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:55,630
Hi.

343
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,630
A new toy?

344
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:01,300
Prototype troop carrier.

345
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:04,040
I once knew a man
who would have loved to fly it.

346
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:06,040
Yeah.

347
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,970
We're gonna need
more than a pilot.

348
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,810
I think
there's an attack coming.

349
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:12,140
Not coming, Bruce.

350
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:14,250
It's already here.

351
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:21,490
<i>They called him
Steppenwolf, the end of worlds.</i>

352
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,590
<i>He lived only to conquer.</i>

353
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:30,990
<i>Millions fell before his blade,
or rose again as his Parademons.</i>

354
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:35,030
<i>Nightmare creatures
who feed on fear.</i>

355
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:38,370
Yeah, I think I met one.

356
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:40,000
We didn't hit it off.

357
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:41,770
Here in Gotham?

358
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:45,280
They're all over.
They're looking for his boxes?

359
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,840
The Mother Boxes.

360
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,380
Mother Boxes.

361
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:50,580
I guess Steppenwolf took the one
your people were guarding.

362
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,110
That leaves two more.

363
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,620
I'm impressed.

364
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:55,920
Don't be.
I have no idea what's in them.

365
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,720
A weapon? Some kind of power?

366
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,220
They don't contain power.

367
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:02,390
They are power.

368
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:06,230
<i>Carried from planet to planet,</i>

369
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:09,600
<i>the Mother Boxes combine
to form the unity.</i>

370
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,200
<i>An apocalyptic power
that not only destroys worlds,</i>

371
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:18,940
<i>but transforms them into the primordial
hellscape of Steppenwolf's birth world.</i>

372
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,180
<i>We should have died.</i>

373
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:24,850
<i>But we formed our own unity.</i>

374
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:31,760
<i>Amazons, Atlanteans, all the
tribes of men fought side by side.</i>

375
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:35,660
<i>Warriors of legend...</i>

376
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:41,070
<i>...allies from other worlds,</i>

377
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:46,900
<i>even the gods themselves
all acted as one,</i>

378
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:50,240
<i>laying down their lives
to drive Steppenwolf away.</i>

379
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,250
<i>Some say it drove him mad.</i>

380
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:07,120
<i>The disgrace
of his first retreat.</i>

381
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:09,330
<i>He swore our alliance
would crumble.</i>

382
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:13,230
<i>That darkness would cover
the Earth.</i>

383
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,740
<i>And that he would return
when it did.</i>

384
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:25,010
<i>Left behind,</i>

385
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:27,650
<i>the Mother Boxes were too
dangerous to be kept together.</i>

386
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:32,520
<i>One was entrusted
to the Amazons.</i>

387
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,220
<i>One to the Atlanteans.</i>

388
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:40,030
<i>Both sealed and guarded
in secure strongholds.</i>

389
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:45,130
<i>The Box of Men
was buried in secret,</i>

390
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:49,470
<i>so that no tribe would be tempted
to use its power over another.</i>

391
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:56,440
Such harmony out of such horror.

392
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:59,140
It was truly an Age of Heroes.

393
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:02,510
Something tells me we're not
getting the band back together.

394
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,750
The Atlanteans
were forced undersea,

395
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:07,880
and the Amazons to an island
they can never leave.

396
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:10,790
Well, I wouldn't count
on the tribes of men.

397
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:13,730
We tend to act like the Doomsday
Clock has a snooze button.

398
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:16,400
- How long until...
- Days.

399
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,430
At most.

400
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:22,100
Steppenwolf's mistake last time
was attacking us.

401
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,870
He wanted to make the Earth
kneel before he destroyed us.

402
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:28,740
This time he'll just go
after the boxes.

403
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:31,040
I got a location
for one of our recruits.

404
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,270
Barry Allen.

405
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,580
What about the other one?
Victor Stone?

406
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:36,110
I was hoping
you would dig him up.

407
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:41,880
We're asking people we don't
know to risk their lives.

408
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,120
I know.

409
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,560
That's how this works.

410
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:20,960
Barry Allen, Bruce Wayne.

411
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:25,360
You said that like it explains why
there's a total stranger in my place,

412
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,870
sitting in the dark,
in my second favorite chair.

413
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:29,900
Tell me about this.

414
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:39,210
This is a person who looks exactly
like me, but who is definitely not me.

415
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:43,150
Very attractive Jewish boy.

416
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:46,250
Somebody who, I don't know,
stole your pocket watch?

417
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:48,950
Or railroads?

418
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:50,520
I know you have abilities.

419
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,760
I just don't know what they are.

420
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:58,460
My special skills include viola, web
design, fluent in sign language...

421
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:00,260
Gorilla sign language.

422
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:04,230
Silica-based quartz sand fabric,
abrasion resistant, heat resistant...

423
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,400
Yeah, I do competitive
ice dancing.

424
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,900
It's what they use
on the space shuttle

425
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:09,810
to prevent it from burning up
on reentry.

426
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:13,910
I do very competitive
ice dancing.

427
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:16,810
Whoever you're looking for,
it's not me.

428
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:42,940
You're the Batman?

429
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,740
So, you're fast.

430
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:46,680
That feels like
an oversimplification.

431
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:50,310
I'm putting together a team.
People with special abilities.

432
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:52,080
You see,
I believe enemies are coming.

433
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,450
Stop right there. I'm in.

434
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:56,850
- You are?
- Yeah.

435
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,420
I need friends.

436
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:03,290
People are difficult.
They require a lot of focus.

437
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:05,430
They, uh...
They have, like, a rhythm

438
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:07,630
that I haven't quite
been able to...

439
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:11,170
Like brunch!
Like, what is brunch?

440
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:14,670
You wait in line for an hour
for, essentially, lunch.

441
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:16,380
I mean...

442
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,110
I don't know.

443
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:21,750
People are a little slow.

444
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,020
I'll try to keep up.

445
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:27,080
Can I keep this?

446
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,590
It's like this layer
of dimensional reality,

447
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:31,090
and it seems to manipulate
space-time.

448
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:32,620
I call it the Speed Force.

449
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:34,490
Causes me to burn a tremendous
amount of calories.

450
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:37,330
So I'm just a black hole
of snacks.

451
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:39,830
I am a "snack" hole.

452
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:43,100
How many people
are on this special fight team?

453
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,430
Three, including you.

454
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,040
Three? Against what?

455
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,440
I'll tell you on the plane.

456
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,280
The plane?

457
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,810
What are your superpowers again?

458
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:54,780
I'm rich.

459
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,370
The program always gets
twitchy with this footage.

460
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,390
You know who we are.

461
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:40,990
Are you Victor Stone?

462
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,800
I need to speak to you.

463
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:51,570
No. Face-to-face.

464
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:53,070
I'm old-fashioned that way.

465
00:39:56,270 --> 00:40:00,350
If I was going to attack you, I
would have done it by the lake.

466
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:05,580
Looks like you have a date,
Ms. Prince.

467
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:09,050
<i>About time somebody here did.</i>

468
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:44,690
Face-to-face.

469
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:46,390
I've been doing some tracking.

470
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:52,160
What you're looking for
is sticking to the dead zones.

471
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,860
If it gets in front of a camera,
causes a surge,

472
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,340
- I'll let you know.
- That's not good enough.

473
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:59,540
Not good enough?

474
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:02,100
<i>For you.</i>

475
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:06,140
Look, I don't know you, and I don't
know how you got these gifts.

476
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:07,240
Gifts?

477
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:08,910
No one else can do what you do.

478
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:14,520
No. If these are gifts, then why
am I the one paying for them?

479
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,850
We need you, Victor.

480
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:19,990
And maybe you need us.

481
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:21,520
I do fine alone.

482
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:24,060
I told myself the same
for a long time.

483
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:31,770
I lost someone I loved once.

484
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:36,880
I shut myself off from...

485
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:40,010
From everyone.

486
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:42,710
But I had to learn to open
back up again.

487
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:48,320
The truth is,
I'm still working on it.

488
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,620
And if you agreed to meet me,

489
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:54,730
you're working on it, too.

490
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:57,800
Trust me, Victor.

491
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:08,170
<i>Mayday! Mayday!</i>

492
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:11,980
<i>Something came down
from the sky!</i>

493
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:13,410
<i>Cortlandt, you're cutting out.</i>

494
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:14,680
<i>Please help me!</i>

495
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:38,770
Whiskey.

496
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:40,740
And one for Ahab, there.

497
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:43,010
From the sky.

498
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:45,070
I heard a cannon.

499
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:47,210
- To ocean's rage.
- And they came.

500
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:51,280
Monsters from the sky.

501
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:55,020
Tore right through my boat.

502
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,520
Monsters.

503
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:00,630
It's on him.

504
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:27,140
You took a hell of a hit.

505
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:29,010
You all right?

506
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:30,840
At last.

507
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:33,410
The firstborn of beloved
Queen Atlanna.

508
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:36,380
Wait.

509
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:39,790
Please.

510
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:43,820
I knew her.

511
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:47,360
Well, that makes one of us.

512
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:51,490
When my parents fought in
the wars, she took me in.

513
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:52,860
What a saint.

514
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:54,360
You dare speak
of Queen Atlanna that way?

515
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,670
Your Queen left me
on my father's doorstep

516
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:58,000
and never gave me
another thought.

517
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,270
Your mother left you
to save your life.

518
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:02,770
You cannot imagine
how it hurt her.

519
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:04,240
What it cost her.

520
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:08,380
But you're not a defenseless
child now.

521
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,410
It would have been
her responsibility

522
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:14,490
to follow that monster
to the surface and stop it.

523
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:19,420
Now, it's yours.

524
00:46:21,290 --> 00:46:23,160
Then I'm gonna need
something from you.

525
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:26,660
<i>I see, Mother.</i>

526
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:30,860
<i>I see why you waited
to summon me.</i>

527
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:36,430
<i>The Kryptonian's death plunged
this timid world into such terror.</i>

528
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:42,570
Amazons, Atlanteans,
each stands and falls alone.

529
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:50,680
I know, Mother, you've waited
too long for the unity.

530
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:53,280
I know. But you will feed.

531
00:47:56,290 --> 00:48:00,190
And my exile will come
to an end.

532
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:03,900
I will take my place among
the New Gods.

533
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:07,370
Find the last one!

534
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:11,940
Its power will cleanse
this world.

535
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,410
For the unity!

536
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:18,440
For Darkseid.

537
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:29,350
Oh, Victor.

538
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:41,700
Asshole!

539
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:44,630
Eight kidnappings.
Six in Metropolis, two here.

540
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,540
All the vics work for STAR Labs.

541
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:52,010
"Attacked by a flying vampire."

542
00:48:52,010 --> 00:48:55,940
"Suspect was a giant bat
with huge fangs."

543
00:48:55,950 --> 00:48:57,580
One of them was a little kid.

544
00:48:57,580 --> 00:49:00,380
Scared. Won't say a word
but drew this. Looks like...

545
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:02,620
I know what it looks like.

546
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:04,990
Come on, you think he fights
criminals for 20 years here,

547
00:49:04,990 --> 00:49:07,890
and then he goes to Metropolis
and kidnaps eight people?

548
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:11,160
I'll talk to him tonight.

549
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:13,230
World's gone crazy, Jim.

550
00:49:13,230 --> 00:49:14,670
Maybe he did, too.

551
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:20,570
Did you find the cyborg?

552
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:23,170
We spoke.

553
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:25,040
Give him time.

554
00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:28,180
You must be Barry. I'm Diana.

555
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:29,810
Hi, Barry, I'm Diana.

556
00:49:29,810 --> 00:49:31,610
That's not right. Great.

557
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:34,580
- So this is us?
- Yeah, this is us.

558
00:49:34,590 --> 00:49:36,650
Oh! Awesome!

559
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:39,120
That's the Bat-Signal!
That's your... Oh, sh...

560
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:40,860
Sorry.
That's your signal.

561
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:42,260
That means we have to go now.

562
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:43,960
Yeah, that's what that means.

563
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:45,230
It's so cool.

564
00:50:20,930 --> 00:50:23,000
How many of you are there?

565
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,530
Not enough.

566
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:28,540
Eight people abducted
from or near STAR Labs.

567
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:30,170
Here's the potential perp.

568
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:32,640
Parademons.

569
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,080
Okay.

570
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:36,010
The demons must have caught
the scent of the Mother Box.

571
00:50:36,010 --> 00:50:38,750
They carried people away
to find out what they know.

572
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:40,180
So the eight may still be alive.

573
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:41,720
Nine.

574
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:46,420
The head of STAR Labs
was taken as well.

575
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:48,590
You made it.

576
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:53,430
So then, there must be
a nest nearby.

577
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:56,900
I plotted all the sightings
in Metropolis, Gotham.

578
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:58,270
No pattern I can see.

579
00:50:58,270 --> 00:51:00,000
The lines on the map
don't converge.

580
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,640
On land.

581
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:04,040
These lead back to Braxton
Island between the two cities.

582
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:05,270
Gotham Harbor.

583
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,340
These are air vents.

584
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:10,580
They all lead down to the tunnel for
Metropolis Project that was abandoned in '29.

585
00:51:13,350 --> 00:51:14,650
Do you really think that...

586
00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:19,590
Oh, wow. They just...
They really just vanish.

587
00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:21,090
Huh? Oh.

588
00:51:21,090 --> 00:51:22,290
That's rude.

589
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:51,390
- Where are we, Alfred?
- <i>Braxton Island.</i>

590
00:51:51,390 --> 00:51:56,460
You should be directly under the
venting tower for the tunnel.

591
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:59,460
<i>Now look to your left,
you should see a staircase.</i>

592
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:01,430
<i>It'll give you access
to the machine room.</i>

593
00:52:07,710 --> 00:52:10,110
Define "access."

594
00:52:10,110 --> 00:52:14,650
One at a time.
The bridge may not hold.

595
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:22,250
<i>Just tell me the truth.</i>

596
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:24,850
<i>Please, just let us go.
I have a family.</i>

597
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:26,220
<i>Wrong answer.</i>

598
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:29,190
<i>Humans.</i>

599
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:33,300
<i>The stench of your fear
is making my soldiers hungry.</i>

600
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:35,670
Shall I feed them?

601
00:52:36,970 --> 00:52:39,100
You've been near the Mother Box.

602
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:40,470
Her scent is on you.

603
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:43,140
Please. We have families.

604
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:45,510
Why does everyone keep
telling me that?

605
00:52:45,510 --> 00:52:47,010
<i>Please, please.</i>

606
00:52:47,010 --> 00:52:49,880
<i>I don't need to hurt you...</i>

607
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:52,580
Right. Okay. Yeah.
Here's the thing. Um...

608
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:58,220
See, I'm afraid of bugs and, um,
guns, and obnoxiously tall people.

609
00:52:58,220 --> 00:52:59,890
And murder. And I can't be here.

610
00:53:01,690 --> 00:53:03,990
It's really cool you guys seem
ready to do battle and stuff,

611
00:53:03,990 --> 00:53:06,730
but, full transparency,
I've never done battle.

612
00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:09,300
I've just pushed some people
and run away.

613
00:53:09,830 --> 00:53:11,270
Save one.

614
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:14,140
- What?
- Save one person.

615
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:16,400
Uh... Which one?

616
00:53:16,410 --> 00:53:19,680
Don't talk, don't fight.
Get in, get one out.

617
00:53:20,110 --> 00:53:21,780
And then?

618
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:22,780
You'll know.

619
00:53:24,950 --> 00:53:26,050
Okay.

620
00:53:27,850 --> 00:53:29,290
Useless.

621
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:32,390
You then.

622
00:53:34,390 --> 00:53:37,560
Where is my Mother Box?

623
00:53:38,730 --> 00:53:41,030
I'll die before I tell you.

624
00:53:41,030 --> 00:53:44,500
At last, one that doesn't whine.

625
00:53:47,270 --> 00:53:49,340
But you will scream.

626
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:55,710
Dad.

627
00:53:55,710 --> 00:53:57,080
Victor.

628
00:53:57,080 --> 00:54:01,280
Ah, you were born of her.

629
00:54:01,290 --> 00:54:03,890
A creature of chaos.

630
00:54:03,890 --> 00:54:05,150
Not how I see it.

631
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:06,890
Give it time.

632
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:08,860
Ahh!

633
00:54:20,170 --> 00:54:21,940
Amazon!

634
00:54:30,610 --> 00:54:31,980
Okay.

635
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:34,620
Save one. Save one.

636
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:46,860
This one is mine.

637
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:50,730
You overestimate yourself.

638
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:52,530
Child,

639
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:56,670
my ax is still slick
with the blood of your sisters.

640
00:55:11,150 --> 00:55:13,020
Alfred, I need the Nightcrawler.

641
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:14,860
Thought you'd never ask.

642
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:17,360
Crawler's on the way.
Initiating remote mode.

643
00:55:30,770 --> 00:55:32,670
- Okay, you good?
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

644
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:35,140
At the end of the hall,
there should be stairs. Go!

645
00:55:35,150 --> 00:55:37,450
He's after the change engine.
His Mother Box.

646
00:55:37,450 --> 00:55:38,810
You have to keep him from it.

647
00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:40,180
- Help people get to safety.
- Promise me!

648
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:41,390
Go!

649
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:18,320
Finish her!

650
00:56:22,690 --> 00:56:24,030
Sorry, guys.

651
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:27,300
I didn't bring a sword.

652
00:56:40,310 --> 00:56:42,850
Jesus. He is tall.

653
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:29,090
Oh, fuck.

654
00:57:42,170 --> 00:57:43,170
Uh...

655
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:57,150
So, you have the blood
of the Old Gods in you.

656
00:58:03,130 --> 00:58:05,060
The Old Gods died.

657
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:16,400
No!

658
00:58:34,090 --> 00:58:35,090
Heads up.

659
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:48,770
Thanks, Alfred,
but I'll take it from here.

660
00:58:48,770 --> 00:58:50,710
Uh, do I know you?

661
00:59:08,090 --> 00:59:10,230
Primitive beings.

662
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:16,970
What are we under right now?

663
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:21,110
Gotham Harbor.

664
00:59:24,810 --> 00:59:26,110
You all need to move.

665
00:59:26,110 --> 00:59:27,070
You get him out.

666
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:28,340
Diana, there's no time.

667
00:59:28,350 --> 00:59:30,650
Also among my fears is drowning.

668
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:32,650
You are a distraction.

669
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:35,020
Mother is calling.

670
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:40,790
<i>Diana, come on!</i>

671
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:12,920
Oh, come on.

672
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:17,960
Whoa!

673
01:00:32,810 --> 01:00:34,210
The change engine.

674
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:42,120
Did he just bail?

675
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:44,490
Millions in structural damage.

676
01:00:44,490 --> 01:00:46,220
You haven't lost your touch.

677
01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:48,730
But it's good to see you
playing well with others.

678
01:00:52,730 --> 01:00:53,930
Dressed like a bat.

679
01:00:54,670 --> 01:00:55,900
I dig it.

680
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:58,630
May be temporary.

681
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:01,740
So, what made you change
your mind?

682
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:03,840
Steppenwolf.

683
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:05,870
He took the Mother Box
from Atlantis.

684
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:08,510
All he needs now
is the lost Box of Men.

685
01:01:08,510 --> 01:01:09,850
If he doesn't already have it.

686
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:14,220
He doesn't have it.

687
01:02:01,930 --> 01:02:04,330
Wow! It's like a cave.

688
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:09,070
Like a bat cave.

689
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:14,280
Barry.

690
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:17,980
My father called it
a change engine.

691
01:02:17,980 --> 01:02:20,380
It was found by the British
during World War I.

692
01:02:20,380 --> 01:02:24,450
They studied it, but they couldn't
even date it, it's so old.

693
01:02:24,460 --> 01:02:28,160
It was shelved till
the night Superman died.

694
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:30,460
Then she lit up like Christmas.

695
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:35,260
They brought it to STAR Labs where my father
recognized it as a perpetual energy matrix.

696
01:02:35,270 --> 01:02:38,170
That sounds cool. I thought
it was like a nuclear bomb.

697
01:02:38,170 --> 01:02:41,370
A Mother Box destroys
as it creates.

698
01:02:41,370 --> 01:02:45,070
It's a cycle of life,
but a million times faster.

699
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:47,440
My father thought it was the key
to unlimited energy.

700
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:49,810
New formulas.

701
01:02:49,810 --> 01:02:51,650
Cellular regeneration.

702
01:02:51,650 --> 01:02:53,950
<i>But it's too volatile
to control.</i>

703
01:02:53,950 --> 01:02:55,290
He used it on you.

704
01:02:56,090 --> 01:02:58,350
I was in an accident.

705
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:00,360
<i>Should've died.</i>

706
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:02,890
<i>My father thought that he
could use the Mother Box</i>

707
01:03:02,890 --> 01:03:04,330
<i>to rebuild the broken
parts of me</i>

708
01:03:04,330 --> 01:03:06,290
<i>with a few
cybernetic enhancements.</i>

709
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:08,160
<i>Instead he built
a living machine</i>

710
01:03:08,170 --> 01:03:10,000
that may be stronger
than its host.

711
01:03:10,670 --> 01:03:11,870
<i>Too much.</i>

712
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:13,870
Too much life.

713
01:03:14,770 --> 01:03:16,270
What's on your weird mind?

714
01:03:16,270 --> 01:03:21,280
Muscles, coordination,
basic cellular integrity.

715
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:24,710
A human being can only
absorb so much.

716
01:03:24,710 --> 01:03:28,350
The Mother Box was designed
to reshape a planet.

717
01:03:28,350 --> 01:03:29,580
So?

718
01:03:29,590 --> 01:03:33,050
So, what if you were stronger
than a planet?

719
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:37,590
Your cells lying dormant,
but incapable of decay.

720
01:03:37,590 --> 01:03:41,660
If you were in a conductive field,
a boost from the Mother Box...

721
01:03:41,670 --> 01:03:44,000
Could bring him back to life.

722
01:03:46,370 --> 01:03:48,870
The Kryptonian ship
has an amniotic chamber,

723
01:03:48,870 --> 01:03:50,910
- which would be a perfect...
- No.

724
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:52,640
- <i>Diana...</i>
- Bruce, no.

725
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:55,110
You have no idea what kind
of power you are dealing with.

726
01:03:55,110 --> 01:03:56,740
Even if there's a fraction
of a chance?

727
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:59,450
That what? That we could raise
a monster like Luthor did?

728
01:03:59,450 --> 01:04:01,280
We have tech Luthor's
never even seen.

729
01:04:01,290 --> 01:04:02,920
Superman is dead.

730
01:04:03,950 --> 01:04:05,350
We all wish he weren't.

731
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:07,150
We don't know
what state he's in.

732
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:09,160
We know we can't bring him back.

733
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:11,860
But this is science
beyond our limits.

734
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:13,460
And that's what science is for.

735
01:04:13,460 --> 01:04:15,060
To do what's never been done.
To make life better.

736
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:17,070
Or to end it.

737
01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:18,730
Technology is like
any other power.

738
01:04:18,730 --> 01:04:21,940
Without reason, without heart,
it destroys us.

739
01:04:23,170 --> 01:04:24,880
You're risking lives.

740
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:27,380
Theirs and maybe countless more.

741
01:04:27,380 --> 01:04:29,610
We don't have time
for a control group.

742
01:04:29,610 --> 01:04:31,780
Is it a risk? Yes.
But it's necessary.

743
01:04:31,780 --> 01:04:33,220
Why, because of your guilt?

744
01:04:35,650 --> 01:04:37,790
Bruce, I was there.

745
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:39,520
You didn't kill Superman.

746
01:04:41,130 --> 01:04:43,990
At some point, even you have
to learn to move on.

747
01:04:43,990 --> 01:04:46,060
Steve Trevor tell you that?

748
01:04:57,410 --> 01:05:01,580
Superman was a beacon
to the world.

749
01:05:03,010 --> 01:05:04,280
Why aren't you?

750
01:05:06,150 --> 01:05:08,150
<i>You're an inspiration, Diana.</i>

751
01:05:08,150 --> 01:05:12,920
You don't just save people, you
make them see their better selves.

752
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:17,890
And yet, I'd never heard of you until
Luthor lured you out by stealing

753
01:05:17,890 --> 01:05:19,430
a picture
of your dead boyfriend.

754
01:05:22,070 --> 01:05:24,670
You shut yourself down
for a century,

755
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:28,240
so let's not talk about
me moving on.

756
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:31,770
You know that if she kills
you, we'll cover for her.

757
01:05:31,770 --> 01:05:34,080
We are not enough!

758
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:36,040
Each of us, in our own way,
is held back.

759
01:05:36,050 --> 01:05:38,350
And I promise you, Steppenwolf is
not out there talking about ethics.

760
01:05:38,350 --> 01:05:41,280
He's trying to burn
down the world!

761
01:05:41,290 --> 01:05:44,720
The way we're gonna stop him
is by using his power...

762
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:47,090
This power, against him.

763
01:05:48,630 --> 01:05:50,960
I agree.

764
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:54,500
I don't like the idea of
reintegrating with the Mother Box,

765
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:56,800
but I was running the numbers
while you were being an asshole,

766
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:59,130
and there is a high probability
that we can bring him back.

767
01:05:59,140 --> 01:06:02,670
Right, right. But we mean bring him
back in like a, "Yay, he's back!" way,

768
01:06:02,670 --> 01:06:07,240
not in like
a <i>Pet Sematary</i> scenario.

769
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:08,680
You lose something when you die.

770
01:06:09,710 --> 01:06:11,550
Even Superman.

771
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:13,210
Maybe not his mind.

772
01:06:13,220 --> 01:06:15,050
Maybe his soul.

773
01:06:15,050 --> 01:06:17,720
I'll have a contingency plan
for that.

774
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:22,330
If he wakes up and you're the first
thing he sees, you'll need one.

775
01:06:33,770 --> 01:06:36,240
Well, that was fun
while it didn't last.

776
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:37,340
She could've stopped me.

777
01:06:37,340 --> 01:06:38,770
I practically dared her to.

778
01:06:38,770 --> 01:06:40,540
I don't see why
you're pushing her.

779
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:44,210
We have to boost the signal.

780
01:06:44,210 --> 01:06:45,950
Put it through
the Batmobile speakers.

781
01:06:45,950 --> 01:06:47,250
Yeah, now you're changing
the subject.

782
01:06:47,250 --> 01:06:48,980
- I have a contingency.
- What?

783
01:06:48,980 --> 01:06:50,720
Diana was right about the risk.

784
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:53,890
If the plan goes south, we're
gonna bring in the big guns.

785
01:06:53,890 --> 01:06:55,190
But that's not...

786
01:06:55,190 --> 01:06:57,760
Those are very big guns.

787
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:59,090
You've got a team here.

788
01:06:59,100 --> 01:07:00,430
Superman would bring
this team together

789
01:07:00,430 --> 01:07:02,300
better than I ever could.
His strength...

790
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:03,830
It doesn't matter
how strong you are.

791
01:07:03,830 --> 01:07:05,800
<i>Or what abilities
you might have...</i>

792
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:07,200
He was more human than I am.

793
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:13,980
He lived in this world.

794
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:16,210
Fell in love. Had a job.

795
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:18,720
Despite all that power.

796
01:07:20,950 --> 01:07:22,290
The world needs Superman.

797
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:27,260
And the team needs Clark.

798
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:29,590
And what does Clark need?

799
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:32,500
Maybe he's at peace.

800
01:07:33,730 --> 01:07:34,730
He'll get over it.

801
01:07:45,510 --> 01:07:49,140
You know, I could do
this a lot faster. I just...

802
01:07:49,150 --> 01:07:51,350
Is it weird that
it feels disrespectful?

803
01:07:51,350 --> 01:07:52,350
Yep.

804
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:55,550
Do you feel a sense
of confidence

805
01:07:55,550 --> 01:07:59,760
that we're not doing something
horribly wrong and macabre here?

806
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:02,190
Not really.

807
01:08:02,190 --> 01:08:04,860
- Okay, then why...
- Because I saw Steppenwolf up close.

808
01:08:04,860 --> 01:08:08,400
The stories Diana told us,
I believe them.

809
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:11,230
Why we gotta stop him.

810
01:08:11,230 --> 01:08:12,470
That's the plan.

811
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:14,600
That's the plan.

812
01:08:18,140 --> 01:08:20,440
Okay. We're not ready for...

813
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:22,680
It's racially charged.

814
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:26,550
You got struck
by lightning, huh?

815
01:08:26,550 --> 01:08:29,850
Uh, yeah,
that's the abridged version.

816
01:08:29,850 --> 01:08:31,420
- And you...
- Explosion.

817
01:08:32,020 --> 01:08:33,390
Woke up in a lab.

818
01:08:33,390 --> 01:08:35,120
So we're the accidents.

819
01:08:36,330 --> 01:08:37,730
Yeah, that's us.

820
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:40,830
Hey. No, no.

821
01:08:52,910 --> 01:08:55,280
<i>We're approaching
the Kryptonian ship.</i>

822
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:57,250
<i>ETA 30 seconds.</i>

823
01:09:02,890 --> 01:09:04,350
I'm here for him.

824
01:09:05,420 --> 01:09:07,460
- I swear I would never...
- Save it.

825
01:09:28,750 --> 01:09:30,310
- Okay.
- Okay.

826
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:32,450
Okay.

827
01:09:53,270 --> 01:09:55,170
This is amazing.

828
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:57,300
This is crazy.

829
01:09:57,310 --> 01:09:59,710
Oh, what, now it's crazy?

830
01:09:59,710 --> 01:10:01,710
You lunatics better know
what you're doing.

831
01:10:51,290 --> 01:10:53,200
<i>Welcome.</i>

832
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,400
Lex Luthor fried the circuits
bringing his creature to life.

833
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:00,600
There's not enough charge
to wake the box.

834
01:11:01,470 --> 01:11:02,740
I might be able to do it.

835
01:11:03,710 --> 01:11:06,040
I might be able
to jump-start it.

836
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:08,210
If I can get enough distance, I can
conduct a significant electrical current.

837
01:11:08,210 --> 01:11:11,650
I might be able to wake
the box. If that's...

838
01:11:11,650 --> 01:11:13,850
- still what we want.
- We have to try.

839
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:20,390
This must be the end
of the line.

840
01:11:20,390 --> 01:11:22,290
<i>So, I'm in position.</i>

841
01:11:25,730 --> 01:11:27,400
The Mother Box is ready.

842
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:29,960
You have to charge it the moment
it touches the fluid.

843
01:11:29,970 --> 01:11:31,500
- Five.
- Five.

844
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:34,900
Diana's right.
This is a bad idea.

845
01:11:34,900 --> 01:11:36,610
- Four.
- Four.

846
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:39,680
<i>- Three.</i>
- Three.

847
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:43,510
Two.

848
01:11:44,250 --> 01:11:45,450
<i>One.</i>

849
01:13:29,890 --> 01:13:31,090
He's back.

850
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:48,130
<i>Dispatch, this is 3-Adam-1-6.</i>

851
01:13:48,140 --> 01:13:49,340
<i>Backing up Code Three.</i>

852
01:13:49,340 --> 01:13:50,540
<i>I'm currently two minutes out.</i>

853
01:13:53,740 --> 01:13:55,380
He's not all right.

854
01:13:55,380 --> 01:13:56,480
<i>Copy that.</i>

855
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:00,850
- He's scanning us.
- What?

856
01:14:00,850 --> 01:14:03,420
Arthur, you need to relax.
Your adrenaline's spiking.

857
01:14:03,420 --> 01:14:04,550
Because he's not all right.

858
01:14:04,550 --> 01:14:05,820
Oh, no.

859
01:14:05,820 --> 01:14:08,630
Should we bow?
Or show our bellies?

860
01:14:11,590 --> 01:14:13,990
Victor? Victor!

861
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,600
- Shit!
- What are you doing?

862
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:16,860
- Victor!
- It's my armor's

863
01:14:16,870 --> 01:14:18,200
- defense system.
- No!

864
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:19,870
It's stronger
since the interface.

865
01:14:19,870 --> 01:14:21,500
- I can't control it.
- Victor, no! Victor!

866
01:14:21,510 --> 01:14:23,340
Just think
happy thoughts, Victor.

867
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:24,640
Go to a happier place.

868
01:14:36,420 --> 01:14:37,750
Kal-El, no!

869
01:14:45,830 --> 01:14:48,500
He's confused.
He doesn't know who he is.

870
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:49,730
<i>Pet Sematary.</i>

871
01:14:55,510 --> 01:14:58,070
Arthur, we need to restrain him.

872
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:04,680
I got him.

873
01:15:21,930 --> 01:15:25,570
Kal-El, the last son of Krypton.

874
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:28,840
Remember who you are.

875
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:32,910
Tell me who you...

876
01:16:29,670 --> 01:16:30,900
<i>Clark.</i>

877
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:36,270
I know you.

878
01:16:42,910 --> 01:16:44,880
Please don't make me do this.

879
01:17:06,170 --> 01:17:08,070
Alfred, I need the big gun.

880
01:17:13,580 --> 01:17:15,640
You did this.

881
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:17,310
I had to.

882
01:17:17,310 --> 01:17:18,950
You won't let me live.

883
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:21,920
You won't let me die.

884
01:17:22,650 --> 01:17:24,090
The world needs you.

885
01:17:28,890 --> 01:17:30,360
But does it need you?

886
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:33,830
Tell me.

887
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:37,230
Do you bleed?

888
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:40,740
<i>Clark!</i>

889
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:50,280
Clark.

890
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:53,080
Please.

891
01:18:12,340 --> 01:18:13,340
Please.

892
01:18:20,710 --> 01:18:21,940
Please.

893
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:23,980
Just go.

894
01:18:25,220 --> 01:18:26,220
Yeah.

895
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:28,150
Let's go.

896
01:18:39,890 --> 01:18:43,070
Yeah, something
is definitely bleeding.

897
01:19:03,590 --> 01:19:04,850
The Mother Box.

898
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:07,790
He has the last one.

899
01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:24,070
You brought us here.

900
01:19:25,810 --> 01:19:27,110
You remembered.

901
01:19:29,780 --> 01:19:31,010
This is home.

902
01:19:33,580 --> 01:19:34,820
You smell good.

903
01:19:38,790 --> 01:19:40,020
Did I not before?

904
01:19:56,070 --> 01:19:57,500
Don't do that.

905
01:19:57,510 --> 01:19:59,410
We just got our asses
handed to us.

906
01:19:59,410 --> 01:20:01,640
And Steppenwolf has got
the third box.

907
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:03,840
So we find them.

908
01:20:03,850 --> 01:20:05,910
If the boxes are even close
to each other,

909
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:08,450
there is going to be
some kind of energy surge.

910
01:20:08,450 --> 01:20:11,150
Steppenwolf's gonna be keeping
them somewhere where they don't read.

911
01:20:11,150 --> 01:20:13,290
No Internet,
no satellite coverage.

912
01:20:13,290 --> 01:20:15,960
- Well, that narrows it down.
<i>- Not enough.</i>

913
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:17,860
So, you can't find them.

914
01:20:17,860 --> 01:20:19,260
Or maybe you don't want to.

915
01:20:22,470 --> 01:20:24,000
Arthur.

916
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,370
Yeah, that was a great way
to get rid of Superman.

917
01:20:25,370 --> 01:20:27,630
Man, I'm not doing
this on purpose.

918
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:30,570
Right, 'cause you can't
control the machine.

919
01:20:30,570 --> 01:20:34,210
So is this a bad time
to bring up my blood sugar?

920
01:20:36,550 --> 01:20:37,550
Very hungry.

921
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:41,480
Victor.

922
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:45,320
You can find the boxes.
You share their energy.

923
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:47,950
I know it's frightening,
but if you go under,

924
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:50,360
I promise we will pull
you back out.

925
01:20:53,700 --> 01:20:56,270
Just keep the little merman
away from me while I work.

926
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:02,740
Barry, go find Alfred
in the pantry.

927
01:21:02,740 --> 01:21:04,170
When you come back, get online.

928
01:21:04,170 --> 01:21:06,010
Everybody checks
everybody else's work.

929
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:08,540
Listen...

930
01:21:08,540 --> 01:21:12,980
I was wondering if you could
put out a feeler.

931
01:21:12,980 --> 01:21:14,520
Like, aquatic.

932
01:21:16,990 --> 01:21:18,290
Do you talk to fish?

933
01:21:20,290 --> 01:21:22,930
The water does the talking.

934
01:21:23,830 --> 01:21:25,330
Of course.

935
01:21:25,330 --> 01:21:27,530
If the current comes in strange,
it might point the way.

936
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:29,300
Okay.

937
01:21:52,820 --> 01:21:54,020
Wait.

938
01:21:54,920 --> 01:21:57,060
Let me.

939
01:21:57,060 --> 01:21:58,460
It's just a little out of place.

940
01:22:01,130 --> 01:22:04,230
So Clark seemed to share
your view on being woken up.

941
01:22:04,230 --> 01:22:06,170
He could've killed you.

942
01:22:06,170 --> 01:22:07,600
I was willing to make the trade.

943
01:22:09,970 --> 01:22:12,370
And bringing in Lois Lane?

944
01:22:12,370 --> 01:22:14,310
Remember what you told me
about heart in the hangar?

945
01:22:14,310 --> 01:22:15,480
I bet you...

946
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:16,980
...thought I wasn't listening.

947
01:22:18,410 --> 01:22:19,450
Thank you.

948
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:25,120
You know you can't
do this forever.

949
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:26,960
I can barely do it now.

950
01:22:27,790 --> 01:22:29,060
Steppenwolf.

951
01:22:29,730 --> 01:22:30,790
This is the job.

952
01:22:30,790 --> 01:22:32,930
It's my job.

953
01:22:32,930 --> 01:22:35,500
And I haven't been doing it.
I've been reacting.

954
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:37,600
Not leading.

955
01:22:40,770 --> 01:22:42,440
You know, what you said
about Steve Trevor...

956
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:44,140
It wasn't my business.
I'm sorry.

957
01:22:46,140 --> 01:22:48,410
You were pushing me
to lead the team.

958
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:51,410
But leaders get people killed.

959
01:22:52,610 --> 01:22:58,120
I fought always
when I was needed.

960
01:22:58,120 --> 01:23:02,190
But to lead, to step into the
light and to say to people,

961
01:23:02,190 --> 01:23:04,090
"This is worth your life."

962
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:07,500
When it's your fault,

963
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,430
they're all Steve Trevor.

964
01:23:14,140 --> 01:23:18,070
We make it through tonight, you
can stay in the shadows forever.

965
01:23:19,580 --> 01:23:20,870
Dress up like a bat.

966
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:22,150
I won't even sue.

967
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:25,710
If we get through the night.

968
01:23:46,640 --> 01:23:47,670
Are you okay?

969
01:23:50,270 --> 01:23:51,540
You brought us here,
but you've...

970
01:23:51,540 --> 01:23:53,840
hardly spent
a minute in the house.

971
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:55,340
I know. It's...

972
01:23:57,910 --> 01:23:59,510
I just got out of a wooden box.

973
01:24:02,590 --> 01:24:03,620
What was it like?

974
01:24:05,690 --> 01:24:06,690
Coming back?

975
01:24:10,730 --> 01:24:11,760
Itchy.

976
01:24:13,690 --> 01:24:19,670
I mean, honestly,
weird in so many ways.

977
01:24:19,670 --> 01:24:22,540
- But mostly just...
- I wasn't strong.

978
01:24:26,110 --> 01:24:27,310
I didn't, um...

979
01:24:28,810 --> 01:24:30,810
You would've been
very disappointed in me.

980
01:24:30,810 --> 01:24:35,320
I wasn't Lois Lane,
the dedicated reporter.

981
01:24:35,950 --> 01:24:37,680
I just...

982
01:24:37,690 --> 01:24:38,760
It's okay.

983
01:24:41,820 --> 01:24:43,190
I'm the idiot who left.

984
01:24:44,730 --> 01:24:46,860
But I'm back now.

985
01:24:46,860 --> 01:24:48,460
And I'm gonna make things right.

986
01:25:07,620 --> 01:25:08,620
Ah.

987
01:25:09,650 --> 01:25:10,720
You called Mom.

988
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:13,820
Of course.

989
01:25:13,820 --> 01:25:15,060
Thank you.

990
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:21,300
I was hoping it was gonna
take you longer to recover.

991
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:25,130
Why?

992
01:25:25,130 --> 01:25:27,270
Because now I have
to send you away.

993
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:31,570
Bruce.

994
01:25:31,570 --> 01:25:33,310
He needs you.

995
01:25:33,310 --> 01:25:34,940
Fate of the world,
I think that's the deal.

996
01:25:34,940 --> 01:25:37,210
He was pretty tense.

997
01:25:37,210 --> 01:25:38,810
Well, I guess I do owe him one.

998
01:25:40,050 --> 01:25:41,280
Right.

999
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:43,850
But no dying.

1000
01:25:45,020 --> 01:25:46,460
And I get the exclusive.

1001
01:25:47,260 --> 01:25:48,560
Yes, ma'am.

1002
01:26:25,130 --> 01:26:26,290
Are you really you?

1003
01:26:26,290 --> 01:26:27,860
I'm really me, Ma.

1004
01:26:39,910 --> 01:26:41,280
At last.

1005
01:26:43,210 --> 01:26:45,710
Praise to the unity!

1006
01:26:48,250 --> 01:26:49,750
The three as one.

1007
01:27:18,010 --> 01:27:21,480
Praise to the mother of horrors.

1008
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:32,330
Is Steppenwolf there?

1009
01:27:32,330 --> 01:27:33,760
Just a minute.

1010
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:36,760
Sorry.

1011
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:39,070
It's Pozharnov
in northern Russia.

1012
01:27:39,070 --> 01:27:40,470
The nuclear plant.

1013
01:27:40,470 --> 01:27:42,100
Had a meltdown 30 years ago.

1014
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:44,540
Uh-huh. There have been some
attempts to resettle nearby.

1015
01:27:44,540 --> 01:27:47,310
But it looks like
really rough sledding.

1016
01:27:47,310 --> 01:27:49,610
Who picks this place
to put down roots?

1017
01:27:49,610 --> 01:27:52,180
People that have been
kicked out of everywhere else.

1018
01:27:52,180 --> 01:27:55,650
The Earth starts changing,
it will hit them first.

1019
01:27:55,650 --> 01:27:58,690
- How long have we got?
- A few hours.

1020
01:27:58,690 --> 01:28:00,520
Transport won't fly that fast.

1021
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:02,860
It will for me.

1022
01:28:44,300 --> 01:28:48,970
The unity brings all three
boxes together in perfect sync.

1023
01:28:48,970 --> 01:28:52,270
Its power builds until
it can't be contained.

1024
01:28:52,270 --> 01:28:56,140
But if I can cause a delay between
each box, even for a nanosecond,

1025
01:28:56,140 --> 01:28:58,580
its energy will cascade,
form a loop.

1026
01:28:58,580 --> 01:28:59,980
They'll feed on each other.

1027
01:28:59,980 --> 01:29:02,020
And that's it?
We just pull them apart.

1028
01:29:02,020 --> 01:29:03,680
No fuss, no muss.

1029
01:29:03,690 --> 01:29:06,290
Separating the boxes is still
gonna cause a massive surge.

1030
01:29:06,290 --> 01:29:07,720
I'll have to be there.

1031
01:29:07,720 --> 01:29:09,490
But you guys should think
about getting clear.

1032
01:29:09,490 --> 01:29:11,220
We're with you till it's done.

1033
01:29:11,230 --> 01:29:13,510
Honestly, I think we're all
gonna be dead way before that.

1034
01:29:14,060 --> 01:29:15,530
And you know what?

1035
01:29:15,530 --> 01:29:18,530
I don't mind.
It's an honorable end.

1036
01:29:18,530 --> 01:29:20,640
But we gotta shut
Steppenwolf down.

1037
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:23,240
Superman's a no-show.

1038
01:29:23,240 --> 01:29:25,070
You got no powers. No offense.

1039
01:29:25,070 --> 01:29:27,740
This guy might be working
for the enemy, we don't know.

1040
01:29:27,740 --> 01:29:29,750
You're tripping over your feet
and mine.

1041
01:29:30,950 --> 01:29:32,410
Oof...

1042
01:29:32,410 --> 01:29:33,710
You're gorgeous.

1043
01:29:33,720 --> 01:29:36,120
And fierce, and strong,
and... Mmm.

1044
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:38,920
I know we went to war with the
Amazons, but that was before my time.

1045
01:29:38,920 --> 01:29:41,550
And you know what?
I don't wanna die.

1046
01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:43,560
I'm young. There's shit
that I want to do.

1047
01:29:44,330 --> 01:29:45,830
I just feel like...

1048
01:29:45,830 --> 01:29:48,290
I didn't really embrace
the sea or the land.

1049
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:49,760
I've been a loner my whole life.

1050
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:52,600
But being part of something
bigger like this,

1051
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:56,970
maybe I'm scared because
I'm meant to...

1052
01:30:09,220 --> 01:30:10,850
I think that was beautiful.

1053
01:30:14,120 --> 01:30:17,560
You say a word about this, and
you'll meet every piranha I know.

1054
01:30:20,030 --> 01:30:23,500
I honestly didn't hear anything
after, "We're all gonna die."

1055
01:30:43,990 --> 01:30:47,020
Ah. Let them come.

1056
01:30:54,900 --> 01:30:58,070
I'm going to take out that tower
and knock down that shield dome.

1057
01:30:58,070 --> 01:30:59,200
You get to Steppenwolf.

1058
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:01,500
Don't wait for me,
just do the job.

1059
01:32:05,570 --> 01:32:07,700
All right, Alfred.
Are we set for broadcast?

1060
01:32:07,700 --> 01:32:10,740
Playing all your favorite hits.

1061
01:32:20,650 --> 01:32:23,020
Come on, follow me,
you damn insects.

1062
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:35,260
They're coming.

1063
01:32:37,230 --> 01:32:38,570
They're all coming.

1064
01:32:42,040 --> 01:32:43,200
<i>Ah.</i>

1065
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:45,170
We might not have
thought this through.

1066
01:32:49,210 --> 01:32:51,080
He's clearing the field.

1067
01:32:51,080 --> 01:32:52,840
He won't last three minutes.

1068
01:32:52,850 --> 01:32:54,080
Then let's use them.

1069
01:32:57,620 --> 01:32:58,820
On my lead.

1070
01:34:11,890 --> 01:34:13,260
<i>Critical damage.</i>

1071
01:34:15,430 --> 01:34:16,830
Son of a bitch.

1072
01:34:19,770 --> 01:34:21,170
Oh, snap!

1073
01:34:25,340 --> 01:34:26,370
You're welcome.

1074
01:34:29,340 --> 01:34:30,540
Yeah!

1075
01:34:30,550 --> 01:34:31,740
This isn't the plan.

1076
01:34:31,750 --> 01:34:33,110
<i>No, Master Wayne.</i>

1077
01:34:33,780 --> 01:34:35,150
This is the team.

1078
01:34:35,980 --> 01:34:37,720
Hey, blame the lady.

1079
01:34:37,720 --> 01:34:39,760
We would've left you,
but she didn't ask for a vote.

1080
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:45,360
So your genius move is dying?

1081
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:47,060
You really are out of your mind.

1082
01:34:47,060 --> 01:34:49,060
I'm not the one
who brought a pitchfork.

1083
01:34:50,830 --> 01:34:53,070
Yahoo!

1084
01:35:12,450 --> 01:35:13,720
Ride ain't over yet.

1085
01:35:13,720 --> 01:35:14,960
My man.

1086
01:36:00,200 --> 01:36:02,600
<i>Is this what conquering is?</i>

1087
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:04,110
Hiding from the fight?

1088
01:36:04,740 --> 01:36:06,340
Oh, no.

1089
01:36:07,270 --> 01:36:08,840
You're all mine.

1090
01:36:14,820 --> 01:36:16,580
- Thanks for the lift.
- Yeah, no problem.

1091
01:36:16,590 --> 01:36:17,750
You got this?

1092
01:36:17,750 --> 01:36:19,350
Whoa!

1093
01:36:19,350 --> 01:36:20,850
These things are gonna
keep coming.

1094
01:36:20,860 --> 01:36:23,020
Okay. You get technical,
I'm on bug duty.

1095
01:36:23,020 --> 01:36:24,290
Let's do it.

1096
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,970
Yes! That was gross! Oh...

1097
01:36:51,890 --> 01:36:53,090
Thank you.

1098
01:36:54,820 --> 01:36:56,160
This is...

1099
01:36:57,890 --> 01:36:59,090
This is a lot.

1100
01:37:19,050 --> 01:37:21,180
Now do you see it?

1101
01:37:41,500 --> 01:37:45,070
<i>Whatever you're in the
middle of, it's spreading for miles.</i>

1102
01:37:45,070 --> 01:37:48,140
Satellites show civilians
moving east.

1103
01:37:48,140 --> 01:37:49,840
They're not gonna make it.

1104
01:37:49,850 --> 01:37:51,210
Barry.

1105
01:37:51,210 --> 01:37:52,810
<i>I need you to take a walk.</i>

1106
01:37:59,650 --> 01:38:01,190
God, I hope this is east.

1107
01:38:47,070 --> 01:38:51,040
You're not worthy
to touch Mother.

1108
01:38:51,040 --> 01:38:56,410
She's power, and power is the only law.

1109
01:39:02,180 --> 01:39:05,750
You're all too weak
to see the truth.

1110
01:39:05,750 --> 01:39:06,990
Well...

1111
01:39:08,490 --> 01:39:09,960
I believe in truth.

1112
01:39:11,260 --> 01:39:13,400
But I'm also a big fan
of justice.

1113
01:39:21,870 --> 01:39:22,970
All right.

1114
01:39:27,110 --> 01:39:28,610
Kryptonian!

1115
01:39:46,330 --> 01:39:48,460
So, how do I help?

1116
01:39:48,460 --> 01:39:51,530
We buy him some time, he can stop that
box from destroying all life on Earth.

1117
01:39:52,630 --> 01:39:54,470
We hope.

1118
01:39:54,470 --> 01:39:56,870
Well, I knew you didn't bring
me back 'cause you liked me.

1119
01:39:56,870 --> 01:39:59,170
I don't not...

1120
01:40:05,150 --> 01:40:06,850
- Civilians.
- Barry's headed...

1121
01:40:06,850 --> 01:40:08,080
There's too many of them.

1122
01:40:17,220 --> 01:40:18,460
Come on.

1123
01:40:31,810 --> 01:40:34,380
Okay, this is definitely east.

1124
01:40:41,120 --> 01:40:42,780
Slowpoke.

1125
01:40:42,780 --> 01:40:43,980
Oh, it's on.

1126
01:40:43,980 --> 01:40:45,490
I'll take the ones on the right.

1127
01:40:48,290 --> 01:40:49,490
It's okay.

1128
01:40:50,390 --> 01:40:52,290
Hold on. Hold on. Yeah.

1129
01:41:10,580 --> 01:41:11,750
Dostoevsky!

1130
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:30,730
Is this guy still bothering you?

1131
01:41:44,980 --> 01:41:46,410
Superman!

1132
01:41:46,410 --> 01:41:47,880
We gotta pull
these things apart.

1133
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:51,380
A couple more seconds,
you'll see your opening.

1134
01:41:51,390 --> 01:41:54,050
- Any blowback?
- Big time.

1135
01:41:54,050 --> 01:41:55,550
But I think we can take it.

1136
01:41:55,560 --> 01:41:57,220
Good.

1137
01:41:57,220 --> 01:41:58,760
'Cause I really like
being alive.

1138
01:42:00,030 --> 01:42:01,260
So do I.

1139
01:42:24,620 --> 01:42:25,650
Clark.

1140
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:32,830
I take it back.

1141
01:42:33,930 --> 01:42:35,200
I wanna die.

1142
01:42:39,230 --> 01:42:42,070
Man, my toes hurt!

1143
01:42:42,070 --> 01:42:45,140
I don't even understand
the physics of how my toes hurt.

1144
01:42:46,670 --> 01:42:49,610
Children. I work with children.

1145
01:42:52,450 --> 01:42:56,250
Uh... Have you guys seen
what's going on outside?

1146
01:43:04,890 --> 01:43:08,160
I am the end of worlds!

1147
01:43:09,260 --> 01:43:12,530
Who are you to defy...

1148
01:43:14,300 --> 01:43:17,640
This world is my right!

1149
01:43:39,130 --> 01:43:40,830
No!

1150
01:43:40,830 --> 01:43:42,960
This cannot be.

1151
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:44,630
You recognize that smell?

1152
01:43:46,200 --> 01:43:47,440
Fear.

1153
01:43:50,900 --> 01:43:52,710
No! Leave me!

1154
01:43:56,140 --> 01:43:59,180
Get off me! I command you.

1155
01:44:00,650 --> 01:44:01,680
No!

1156
01:44:04,090 --> 01:44:05,390
No!

1157
01:44:06,990 --> 01:44:08,590
I'll kill you!

1158
01:44:08,590 --> 01:44:10,490
I'll kill you all!

1159
01:44:35,850 --> 01:44:36,920
Booyah!

1160
01:45:02,380 --> 01:45:03,750
I'm glad I didn't miss this.

1161
01:45:05,650 --> 01:45:06,680
So am I.

1162
01:45:07,220 --> 01:45:08,480
Yeah.

1163
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:09,820
Now she's glad.

1164
01:45:40,650 --> 01:45:43,850
"Thank you" is not enough
for what you did.

1165
01:45:43,850 --> 01:45:46,720
I just undid a mistake,
that's all.

1166
01:45:56,130 --> 01:45:57,900
How did you get the house back
from the bank?

1167
01:45:59,270 --> 01:46:00,600
I bought the bank.

1168
01:46:03,300 --> 01:46:04,840
The whole bank?

1169
01:46:04,840 --> 01:46:06,840
It's like a reflex with me.
I don't know.

1170
01:46:10,750 --> 01:46:12,240
What?

1171
01:46:12,250 --> 01:46:15,210
It's actually the worst job
you can get in a crime lab.

1172
01:46:15,220 --> 01:46:17,880
But my foot's in the door.

1173
01:46:17,890 --> 01:46:20,690
Yeah, I got a recommendation
from a friend.

1174
01:46:20,690 --> 01:46:22,460
This is like a "job" job?

1175
01:46:23,190 --> 01:46:24,390
"Job" job.

1176
01:46:28,100 --> 01:46:29,400
Look at you go.

1177
01:46:47,350 --> 01:46:52,750
<i>Darkness, the truest darkness,
is not the absence of light.</i>

1178
01:46:54,320 --> 01:46:57,790
<i>It is the conviction that
the light will never return.</i>

1179
01:46:58,690 --> 01:47:01,390
Must be 100, 150 feet.

1180
01:47:01,390 --> 01:47:02,600
Must be.

1181
01:47:04,100 --> 01:47:05,960
Big round table.

1182
01:47:05,970 --> 01:47:07,840
Six chairs, right there.

1183
01:47:09,170 --> 01:47:10,440
But room for more.

1184
01:47:13,210 --> 01:47:16,170
But room for more.

1185
01:47:16,180 --> 01:47:20,750
<i>But the light always returns
to show us things familiar.</i>

1186
01:47:22,350 --> 01:47:25,020
<i>Home, family,</i>

1187
01:47:26,750 --> 01:47:31,460
<i>and things entirely new,
or long overlooked.</i>

1188
01:47:36,530 --> 01:47:41,670
<i>It shows us new possibilities and
challenges us to pursue them.</i>

1189
01:47:43,140 --> 01:47:45,100
Yeah, and Jerry Monasco
runs the whole kit.

1190
01:47:45,110 --> 01:47:47,040
I mean, he did the Bilbao job
two years ago.

1191
01:47:47,040 --> 01:47:49,040
Yeah, he has it all in storage
in Croydon.

1192
01:47:49,040 --> 01:47:50,840
- The Belgian?
- Right, yeah, the Belgian.

1193
01:47:50,850 --> 01:47:53,980
<i>This time,
the light shone on the heroes</i>

1194
01:47:53,980 --> 01:47:57,990
<i>coming out of the shadows to
tell us we won't be alone again.</i>

1195
01:48:00,050 --> 01:48:05,320
<i>Our darkness was deep
and seemed to swallow all hope.</i>

1196
01:48:05,330 --> 01:48:08,730
<i>But these heroes
were here the whole time</i>

1197
01:48:08,730 --> 01:48:13,900
<i>to remind us that hope is
real, that you can see it.</i>

1198
01:48:18,610 --> 01:48:20,940
<i>All you have to do is look</i>

1199
01:48:23,610 --> 01:48:24,880
<i>up in the sky.</i>

1200
01:49:23,440 --> 01:49:26,540
I can't tell you how much
I appreciate you doing this.

1201
01:49:26,540 --> 01:49:27,780
Not at all, Barry.

1202
01:49:28,640 --> 01:49:30,080
Curious myself.

1203
01:49:30,080 --> 01:49:31,680
Yeah, and it's not like
a competition, you know?

1204
01:49:31,680 --> 01:49:33,950
Well, it is a competition.

1205
01:49:33,950 --> 01:49:37,150
But, you know, it's not like
a macho measuring thing.

1206
01:49:37,150 --> 01:49:38,650
But if I win,
you're off the team.

1207
01:49:44,760 --> 01:49:46,530
- No...
- Oof.

1208
01:49:47,630 --> 01:49:49,490
If I win,

1209
01:49:49,500 --> 01:49:52,760
Bruce said something about you
having to take us all to brunch?

1210
01:49:52,770 --> 01:49:55,470
Oh, see, now that's cold.
That's a betrayal.

1211
01:49:55,470 --> 01:49:56,770
I feel stung by that.

1212
01:49:58,740 --> 01:50:00,410
Okay, but if I win,
I get to tell everyone.

1213
01:50:00,410 --> 01:50:01,610
Deal.

1214
01:50:02,340 --> 01:50:03,940
Which coast?

1215
01:50:03,940 --> 01:50:05,880
Ah, you know,
I've never seen the Pacific.

1216
01:50:07,510 --> 01:50:08,750
Which is that way.

1217
01:50:08,750 --> 01:50:11,820
Because the sun and it's...

1218
01:57:57,620 --> 01:57:59,450
All right, let's keep it moving.

1219
01:57:59,450 --> 01:58:00,690
<i>Come on, Luthor. Let's go.</i>

1220
01:58:02,520 --> 01:58:03,520
<i>Luthor!</i>

1221
01:58:12,800 --> 01:58:14,330
All right,
stop jerking around, Luthor,

1222
01:58:14,340 --> 01:58:15,740
or I'm gonna have
to come in there.

1223
01:58:48,870 --> 01:58:51,240
Ah! There he is. Welcome aboard.

1224
01:58:51,240 --> 01:58:53,340
Care for a glass
of Goût de Diamants?

1225
01:58:53,340 --> 01:58:55,170
I was just celebrating
God's return

1226
01:58:55,180 --> 01:58:57,940
out of the ground
and back up into the sky.

1227
01:58:57,940 --> 01:59:01,410
He and his odd little friends
are forming some sort of league.

1228
01:59:01,420 --> 01:59:03,080
You better not
be wasting my time.

1229
01:59:03,080 --> 01:59:06,920
No. I have too much to live for
and more important things to do.

1230
01:59:06,920 --> 01:59:09,760
We have to level
the playing field, Mr. Wilson.

1231
01:59:10,790 --> 01:59:12,130
To put it plainly

1232
01:59:13,690 --> 01:59:16,700
shouldn't we have
a league of our own?

1233
01:59:16,724 --> 01:59:23,724
