1
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,070
Morning, Mr. Thrombey.

2
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,670
Mr. Thrombey? You up there?

3
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,350
Mr. Thrombey, I'm coming in.

4
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,670
Shit!

5
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,950
<i>You killed him, you bastard!</i>

6
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,190
<i>You murdered him!</i>

7
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,630
<i>I didn't murder nobody!</i>

8
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,120
<i>You slashed his face open.</i>

9
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,590
<i>You left him bleeding in the street
like a stuck pig,</i>

10
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,630
<i>then you crushed his skull with a forklift</i>

11
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,110
<i>and burned his hands off
to erase the fingerprints!</i>

12
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,550
<i>You'll never prove it.</i>

13
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,710
<i>We have the nanny-cam footage!</i>

14
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,510
Alice, turn that off now, please?

15
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,810
- Why? It's almost over.
- Now. Please, just turn it off.

16
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,210
They're finding out who did it
and the Wi-Fi sucks in my room...

17
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,330
- Turn it off, now. Alice!
- There's two minutes left.

18
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,240
- What? There isn't even anything bad on.
- Off!

19
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,930
It's just normal TV,
and they're just talking!

20
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,310
They're talking murder on it!

21
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,960
- They're just talking.
- Your sister just had a friend she loved

22
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,230
slit his throat open and she doesn't need
to be hearing that right now!

23
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,640
Let's be sensitive!

24
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,960
Alice, you can keep watching your show.
It's fine.

25
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,150
- No, I guessed who did it anyway.
- It's okay.

26
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,270
I'm sorry, Marta.

27
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,630
It's okay.

28
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,600
It's Harlan's son.

29
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,590
Hi, Walt.

30
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,950
<i>Hi, Marta, it's Walt.</i>

31
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,710
<i>Would you mind coming to the house early?</i>

32
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,440
<i>The police have
a few more questions for everybody.</i>

33
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,070
What?

34
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,790
Hey. Excuse me, ma'am.

35
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,070
You with the help?

36
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,830
Hey! Her name's Marta.
She was Granddad's nurse.

37
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,150
She's with us. "The help"?

38
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,670
It's okay. I'm sorry.

39
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,110
No, it's not okay. What the hell?

40
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,030
How are you doing?

41
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,390
Not very good.

42
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,480
Alone.

43
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,070
Lots of this
and not knowing what to do next.

44
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,190
Marta, anything you need...

45
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,390
You're part of this family.

46
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,580
Thank you.

47
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,270
- How you doing, kiddo?
- Linda.

48
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,630
How are you?

49
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,030
You know, the funeral helped, I guess.
Just seeing him.

50
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,910
I thought you should have been there.

51
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,870
- I was outvoted.
- Get arrested!

52
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,270
- Die up your own ass for all I care!
- Richard.

53
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,670
He's not coming.

54
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,550
Ransom. Little shit.

55
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,640
Missed the funeral.

56
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,750
Excuse me.

57
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,990
We're ready for you now.
We'd like to see you one at a time.

58
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,270
All right. I'll go first.

59
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,990
I'm assuming this will all be wrapped up
before the memorial tonight.

60
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,660
We'll do our best, ma'am.

61
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,550
So...

62
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,310
how you doing, kiddo?

63
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,360
We're just gonna reintroduce ourselves
as a formality.

64
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,070
I am Detective Lieutenant Elliott,

65
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,030
and this is Trooper Wagner.

66
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,430
Now, I'm going to record this,
just to make things easier.

67
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,750
All right, we're with
Linda Drysdale nÃ©e Thrombey,

68
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,590
Harlan Thrombey's eldest daughter,

69
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,270
and discussing the events that took place
the night of his demise one week ago.

70
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,710
November 8th.

71
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,510
We're very sorry for your loss.

72
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,230
Thank you. That means a lot.

73
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,950
So, we understand on that night
the family had gathered

74
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,680
- to celebrate your father's 85th birthday?
- Yes.

75
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,550
- How was it?
- The party?

76
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,520
Pre-my-dad's-death?

77
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,710
Oh, it was great.

78
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,350
Did anyone besides the family show face?

79
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,030
<i>Fran, the housekeeper.</i>

80
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,230
He was a nice guy, but he was so hairy.

81
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,070
- Jacob?
- And I've dated Italian guys.

82
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,910
You know what I mean? It was like...

83
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,590
<i>Marta, Harlan's caregiver.</i>

84
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,590
<i>Good girl. Hard worker.</i>

85
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,230
Her family's from Ecuador.

86
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,190
And Wanetta.

87
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,910
<i>Greatnana. Harlan's mom.</i>

88
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,830
- Hi, Nana.
<i>- His mom?</i>

89
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,310
- Nana?
<i>- Wow. How old is she?</i>

90
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,110
<i>We have no idea.</i>

91
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,310
Okay... and your son, Ransom,

92
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,310
<i>did he attend as well?</i>

93
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,030
<i>Yes, but he left early.</i>

94
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,190
Ransom, are you leaving?

95
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,320
Right.

96
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,190
Would you say that all three of you
showed up around the same time?

97
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,720
No.

98
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,630
Richard came early
to help the caterers set up.

99
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,950
Okay. And you and your husband, Richard,
work at a real estate firm in Boston?

100
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,500
No. It's... It's my company.

101
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,110
Right. Right. Sorry.

102
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,760
I built my business from the ground up.

103
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,150
Oh, just like your father.

104
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,110
You two were very close.

105
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,790
We... We had our own secret way
of communicating.

106
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,030
I mean, you had to find that... with Dad.

107
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,070
You had to find a game to play with him,

108
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,670
and if you did that,
and you played by his rules...

109
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,750
Everyone idolizes their dad, right?

110
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,830
I don't know. Do they?

111
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,150
Very much not.

112
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,180
Don't know why I said that.

113
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,440
<i>But my wife, Linda, does.</i>

114
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,430
<i>Harlan started out
with a rusty Smith Corona</i>

115
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,710
<i>and built himself into one of the
best-selling mystery writers of all time.</i>

116
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,990
Wow, seems like all his kids
are self-made overachievers.

117
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,430
Sure.

118
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,630
For the record,
I'm speaking with Walt Thrombey,

119
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,110
Harlan Thrombey's youngest son.

120
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,760
So you run your father's
publishing company?

121
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,150
Yeah. It's my... It's our...

122
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,230
It's the family's publishing company.

123
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,590
Dad trusts me to run it.

124
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,320
Thirty languages.

125
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,830
Over 80 million copies sold.
A real legacy.

126
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,920
You guys fans?

127
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,670
I mean, I don't do much
fiction reading myself, but...

128
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,270
Big fan. I'm a big fan.

129
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,510
I mean, his plots are just like...

130
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,470
Like, I won't spoil it for you but...
Okay, like <i>Thousand Knives?</i>

131
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,880
The cow and the shotgun.

132
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,190
Like, where do you come up with that?

133
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,870
Well, Dad said the plots just popped
into his head, fully formed.

134
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,430
It was the easy part for him.

135
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,460
So you're in the area, right?

136
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,120
So, you guys probably arrived
around the same time.

137
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,150
We all got here around 8:00.

138
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,830
<i>My wife, Donna, she's my rock.</i>

139
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,670
Jesus, Donna! Are you all right?

140
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,150
<i>My son, Jacob, he's 16.</i>

141
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,670
<i>Very politically active.</i>

142
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,190
The boy is literally a Nazi.

143
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,030
He's an alt-right troll dipshit.

144
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,950
Kids today with the Internet,
it's amazing.

145
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,510
So the night went well?

146
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,630
<i>I mean, we're all gutted, but...</i>

147
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,910
<i>I was happy to have that night with him.</i>

148
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,230
<i>To be by his side,</i>

149
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,670
<i>to think about our books
and what we've accomplished with them.</i>

150
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,920
It's like I can still feel his hand
on my shoulder.

151
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,750
Passing the torch.

152
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,470
So, we're here with Joni Thrombey,

153
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,390
Harlan Thrombey's daughter-in-law?

154
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,270
Yeah, I married his son, Neil.

155
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,390
We had one daughter, Meg.

156
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:47,350
And then Neil passed on 15 years ago.

157
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,470
But you remained close to the Thrombeys?

158
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,070
They're my family.

159
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,550
<i>I feel simultaneously freed by</i>

160
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:01,270
<i>and supported by them.</i>

161
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:08,190
It's that balance of opposites
that's the nugget of Flam.

162
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,390
Sorry, the nugget of...

163
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,910
Flam.

164
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,790
Oh, yeah, Flam,
your skin care company. Sorry.

165
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,360
I forgive you.

166
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,390
Yeah, it's skin care,
but it promotes a total lifestyle.

167
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,030
Self-sufficiency with an acknowledgement
of human need.

168
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,230
That's Flam.

169
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,830
But it's also Harlan.

170
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,430
He got me and Meg
through some tough times.

171
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,670
Granddad gives my mom a yearly allowance

172
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,910
and he's never missed wiring
a tuition payment to my schools.

173
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,310
He's a genuinely selfless man.

174
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,830
But you left the party early?

175
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,950
Have fun.

176
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,230
<i>To see some friends at Smith.</i>

177
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,990
You know Dad pays for her
crypto-Marxist-post-deconstructural-

178
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,590
feminist-poetry-theory-whatever major?

179
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,950
She could have stuck around for the cake.

180
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,310
<i>I think Linda was upset.</i>

181
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,680
But Harlan understood.

182
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,120
Right.

183
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,790
You two showed up to the party
around the same time...

184
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,990
If I could pause?

185
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,230
Because I just...

186
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,150
Who is that guy?

187
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,480
- And why are we doing all this again?
- These are just some follow-up questions.

188
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,630
We're attempting to be thorough,
so we can figure out the manner of death.

189
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,800
So by "manner of death,"
you mean if someone killed him?

190
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,790
If one of us killed him?

191
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,170
- One of his family killed him?
- No, Walt... Walt, no, no.

192
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,070
Is that what you're suggesting,
Lieutenant?

193
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,310
No one's saying that, okay?
This is all pro forma.

194
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,080
Okay.

195
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,630
So who the fuck is that?

196
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,150
This is Benoit Blanc.

197
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,030
- Benoit Blanc?
- Yes.

198
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,510
Mr. Blanc is a private investigator
of great renown.

199
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,600
Wait a minute.

200
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,030
I read a tweet about
a <i>New Yorker</i> article about you.

201
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,510
"The Last of the Gentlemen Sleuths."

202
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,870
You solved that case
with the tennis champ.

203
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,990
You're famous.

204
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,230
Mr. Blanc is not
with the police department

205
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,950
and not officially involved in the case,

206
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,630
but he's offered to consult.

207
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,230
Now I happily obliged,
and I can vouch for him.

208
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,950
Mr. Blanc, I know who you are.

209
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,830
I read your profile in the <i>New Yorker.</i>

210
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,670
I found it delightful.

211
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,950
I just buried my 85-year-old father
who committed suicide.

212
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,830
Why are you here?

213
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,510
I'm here at the behest of a client.

214
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,200
Who?

215
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,470
I cannot say.

216
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,990
But let me assure you of this.

217
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,550
My presence will be ornamental.

218
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,720
You will find me a respectful,

219
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,630
quiet, passive observer...

220
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,940
of the truth.

221
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Fine.

222
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,390
Are we getting there?

223
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,670
Nearly. Um...

224
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,640
Harlan's nurse, she was at the party
in a professional capacity?

225
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,030
Marta?

226
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,680
I guess.

227
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,270
<i>Harlan hired her to be around to take care
of whatever medical needs popped up.</i>

228
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,510
<i>But really, she's like part of the family.</i>

229
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,260
<i>Good kid.</i>

230
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,760
<i>Been a good friend to Harlan.</i>

231
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,950
<i>Family's from Paraguay.</i>

232
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,110
Linda really likes her work ethic.

233
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,190
"Immigrants. We get the job done."

234
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,750
- I...
- From <i>Hamilton.</i>

235
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,320
Oh, <i>Hamilton.</i>

236
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,430
It's so good.

237
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,190
- I saw it at The Public.
- Oh!

238
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,350
May I just...

239
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,110
Then I'll recede, but...

240
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,870
as a self-made man myself,

241
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,070
I have to express my admiration

242
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,550
for how you followed
in your father's footsteps.

243
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,830
- Thank you.
- Just marvelous.

244
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,870
You know, the whole family too.

245
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,830
And Joni with her thing,

246
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,310
and Walt with his publishing empire...

247
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,620
It's...

248
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,600
Well...

249
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,830
Yes, I mean, Walt, he's done well

250
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,070
with what Dad gave him.

251
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,590
Not that it matters.

252
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,750
But really, Dad hands him a book
twice a year and Walt publishes it.

253
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,110
It's just not the same.

254
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,830
But surely Walt runs
the merchandising, adaptations,

255
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,840
film and television rights, I mean...

256
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,070
Are you baiting me, Detective?

257
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,710
You know he doesn't.

258
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,910
And if you think I am dumb enough

259
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,870
to be baited into talking family business,

260
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:32,150
into shit-talking my baby brother
in front of a police detective

261
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,390
and a state trooper...

262
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,790
Walt doesn't run shit.

263
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,340
Because there are no TV and film rights.

264
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,200
Harlan never allowed
any adaptations of his books.

265
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,500
Hated the idea.

266
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,630
No.

267
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,940
Yeah!

268
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,910
Drives Walt nuts.
'Cause that's where the real money is.

269
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,390
When Walt would get
a little Irish courage in him,

270
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,110
<i>he'd get into it with Harlan.</i>

271
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,710
Did he "get into it" at the party?

272
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,310
Oh, my God!

273
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,400
Come on, Dad!

274
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,270
<i>Wouldn't leave him alone, the poor guy.</i>

275
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,590
<i>- Harlan finally had to give him the hook.</i>
- ...their business affair guy...

276
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,190
<i>I didn't hear what he said,</i>

277
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,550
<i>but he must've really
handed him his lunch.</i>

278
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:11,230
<i>'Cause Walt was like a wounded puppy
the rest of the night.</i>

279
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,720
What? Richard said what?

280
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,750
No. Jesus. We did not get "into it."

281
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,710
I'm just trying to get
an accurate impression.

282
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,550
Harlan took you aside at the party.

283
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,670
When you returned, you were chastened.

284
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,430
What did Harlan say to you?

285
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,030
The Netflix guys,
their business affair guy.

286
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,200
He sent something over.
It's hard numbers this time.

287
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,590
And I just think this is a window
that's not gonna stay open.

288
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,760
We need to take advantage of it and then
you just need to look at the numbers!

289
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,750
- Yeah, Walt, look...
- Dad! Dad!

290
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,590
You... You put me in charge of our books.

291
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,470
Let me be in charge!
Let me do this! Please!

292
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,950
They're not our books, son.

293
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,670
They're my books.

294
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,270
And this is not how I wanted
to have this conversation.

295
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,710
But you're right, you're right. It's...

296
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,760
It's unfair of me to keep you tethered

297
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,630
to something that isn't yours to control.

298
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,720
What?

299
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,430
No, I've done you a grave disservice.

300
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,680
All these years,

301
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:18,230
I've kept you from building something
of your own that was yours.

302
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:25,190
But you're not going to be running
the publishing house anymore.

303
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,070
You're free of it.

304
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,110
Wh...

305
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,350
Dad, are you firing me?

306
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,040
No, I...

307
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,160
We'll talk details tomorrow.

308
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,460
My mind's made up.

309
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,310
Good boy.

310
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,790
We talked. We had
a business discussion about e-books.

311
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,870
Jesus. It was nothing.

312
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,550
You want to talk about an argument,
hell, Ransom had an argument with him.

313
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,830
Ransom, that's...

314
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,550
Richard and Linda's son?

315
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,310
Look, we all love Ransom.
He's a good kid. We love him.

316
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,720
But?

317
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,270
But he's always been
the black sheep of the family.

318
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,990
And I'm not trying to...

319
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,910
I like to keep stuff like this
in the family.

320
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,750
But with Ransom, he's never had a job.

321
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,940
And Dad, for some unknown reason,
always supported him.

322
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,550
They have this love-hate bond. They fight.

323
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,150
But that night, God, they had a blowout.

324
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,950
About what?

325
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,790
Are you goddamn insane?

326
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,340
<i>We couldn't make it out really,
but it was huge.</i>

327
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,790
<i>And it's strange they went
into another room to do it.</i>

328
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,950
<i>Usually they like to stoke up drama
in front of the whole family.</i>

329
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,030
Speaking of getting into it...

330
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:53,870
You were at the house early
to help the caterers set up. Did...

331
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,270
Did you converse with Harlan at that time?

332
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,710
Well, he was there. We must have spoke.

333
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,020
In his study?

334
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,510
I don't think so.

335
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,110
You see,
I spoke with the caterer this morning.

336
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,590
She didn't see you helping her staff.

337
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,720
She did hear Harlan in a screaming match

338
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,670
with somebody that afternoon in his study.

339
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,230
Yeah, I don't... Screaming match?

340
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,350
No.

341
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,150
But Joni was here too.

342
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,550
She was early, so it might have been her.

343
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,640
Maybe ask her.

344
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,750
These were two male voices.

345
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,950
<i>Harlan shouted the phrase...</i>

346
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,030
You tell her or I will!

347
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,200
"You tell her...

348
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,580
or I will."

349
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,940
Bells ringing?

350
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,360
That's none of your business.

351
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,560
You stay out of my marriage.

352
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,550
I know my daughter,
and she would want to know.

353
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,230
I've put all of it in this letter to her.

354
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,720
Tomorrow, she gets it.

355
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,590
Harlan, I'm warning you.

356
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,450
- No, she deserves to know.
- Stay out of my marriage.

357
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,430
She deserves to know,
and you're gonna tell her.

358
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,430
- The hell I am!
- You tell her or I will!

359
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,990
Yes. I know.

360
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,990
Yes.

361
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:25,470
Harlan had finally decided
to put his mom in a nursing home,

362
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,430
and Linda had always opposed that.

363
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:31,470
And I wanted to wait until we got back
to Boston to tell Linda,

364
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,070
so to avoid a whole scene,

365
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,910
and Harlan wanted me to tell her then.

366
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,110
That was it.

367
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,630
Sorry. Forgot.

368
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,710
The house?

369
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,630
Earlier. Richard said you were there.

370
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,030
I was at the house early.

371
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,390
To see Harlan?

372
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,910
To see Harlan.

373
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,630
Yes.

374
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,750
What were you seeing Harlan about?

375
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,790
It was just a mix-up with the...

376
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,870
the payment for Meg's tuition.

377
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,180
I'm... I'm...

378
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,830
I'm sorry to press,

379
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,990
but what kind of mix-up?

380
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:16,350
Yeah, the school hasn't got the check yet.
I don't know why Alan didn't mail it.

381
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,950
Well, Alan didn't mail it
because he caught a discrepancy.

382
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:25,230
Alan's office has been wiring tuition
directly to the school

383
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,830
as per your request.

384
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:30,270
But Phyllis's office that handles
your yearly allowance

385
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,030
has been wiring tuition monies
directly to you as well.

386
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,240
You have been double-dipping Meg's tuition
and stealing from me...

387
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,310
...$100,000 a year,

388
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,070
for the past four years.

389
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,230
Harlan, I don't know
how this mix-up happened,

390
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,470
- but I swear to God...
- So, now I am writing

391
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:52,230
this tuition check, but you must know
that this is the last money

392
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,790
you or Meg will get from me.

393
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,120
Please, you don't understand...

394
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,830
Joni, I know it'll hurt,

395
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,750
but it's all for the best.

396
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,880
My mind's made up.

397
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,430
It was a money wiring issue

398
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,070
with the office at the school.

399
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,110
So I had to ask Harlan
to cut a check for the semester.

400
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,430
No big deal.

401
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,550
Well...

402
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,430
Why don't we, uh, just take
a little break and we'll resu...

403
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,630
Oh, no.

404
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,040
She's gone.

405
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,110
Richard!

406
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,880
Joni, have you seen Richard?

407
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,680
- No, I was just done with the...
- Okay, thanks.

408
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,440
No.

409
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,750
Damn it. Richard!

410
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,910
Richard?

411
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,190
Son of a bitch.

412
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,750
See, I might be a victim
of my own expectation here,

413
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:34,070
but when the great Benoit Blanc
comes knocking at my door,

414
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:38,230
I expect it's going to be about something,
if not extraordinary,

415
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,390
then at least interesting.

416
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,750
But I'm sorry,
this is an open-and-shut case of suicide

417
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,440
and quite frankly, Benny,
we're getting to the point

418
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,230
where I need to know
what we're doing here.

419
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,510
The method?

420
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,230
Throat slit?

421
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,710
Typical for a suicide?

422
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,630
Yes, I mean, that's dramatic.

423
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,040
But look around.

424
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,390
I mean, the guy practically lives
in a Clue board.

425
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,430
Come on, Benny, talk to me, all right?

426
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,980
Now, you tell me to invite
all of these people back

427
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,070
for questioning all over again.

428
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,160
I get it.

429
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,410
I've had boots on the ground
in this county for a while.

430
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,610
People are generally what they seem to be.
Not gonna find murderers in this family.

431
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,150
This is a pleasant family
with the usual quarrels,

432
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,990
but no possible motives for murder.

433
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,670
Where are you going?

434
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,960
Harlan Thrombey's nurse. Marta...

435
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,950
- Cabrera.
- Marta Cabrera. Please.

436
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,590
Miss Cabrera, you can just wait inside

437
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,710
- and we'll be with you in...
- Miss Cabrera.

438
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,190
I've been doin' a little pokin'.

439
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,590
You were hired on a part-time basis
as a registered nurse, yes?

440
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,070
Yes. I don't work for a VNA.

441
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,950
Harlan hired me directly.

442
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,470
Take a seat, please.

443
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:59,110
And you're paid a flat rate for...

444
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,150
how many hours a week?

445
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,630
Well, I started at 15, and then he...

446
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,790
he needed more help.

447
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,430
Medical help?

448
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,440
He needed a friend.

449
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:19,630
Does having a kind heart
make you a good nurse?

450
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,230
All right, Blanc, I mean, this is...

451
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:26,190
Yeah, yeah. Marta? We were just discussing
possible motives in the family.

452
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:31,150
I suspect that Harlan has told you
much unfiltered truth about each of 'em.

453
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,480
And a little bird has told me...

454
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,190
how shall I put this delicately?

455
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:44,190
You have a regurgitative reaction
to mistruthin'.

456
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,430
Who told you that?

457
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,310
Is it true?

458
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,480
Yes.

459
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,270
It's something I've had since I was a kid.

460
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,470
It's a physical thing that I...

461
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,510
Just the thought of lying...

462
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,070
Yeah, it makes me puke.

463
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,560
Really?

464
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,550
Is Richard havin' an affair?

465
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:18,110
Why do men instinctively
pull at loose threads on their parachutes?

466
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,400
What?

467
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,030
Richard?

468
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,390
- An affair?
- Yeah.

469
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,910
A yes or no will do.

470
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,110
No.

471
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,400
Oh, shit!

472
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,630
- Oh, my God!
- Dear girl, I'm sorry.

473
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,750
I assumed you were speaking figuratively.

474
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,990
- I have Wet-Naps in the car.
- All right, here.

475
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,590
Just take a sip of this.

476
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,900
Take that.

477
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,030
That's quite somethin'.

478
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,870
- Thanks.
- But I was obviously right.

479
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,000
Richard is having an affair.

480
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,310
His father-in-law found out
and confronted him.

481
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,550
"You tell her or I will."

482
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,470
Okay, but even if that were the case...
You all right?

483
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,950
- Yeah.
- Even if that were the case, I mean,

484
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,280
protecting a relationship as a motive,
that's weak sauce.

485
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:15,310
- You know that.
- Well, then there is Joni.

486
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,400
- Joni?
- Joni?

487
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,030
Lifestyle guru JJoni? No.

488
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,810
Harlan was supporting her and her daughter
and that's the opposite of a motive.

489
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,670
And if that support was threatened...
Miss Cabrera, one moment, please.

490
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,950
- Yes, I just wanna get some Scope.
- Miss Cabrera...

491
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,790
Was Harlan plannin' on
cutting off Joni's allowance?

492
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,150
Oh, Joni.

493
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,680
What's up?

494
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,040
Oh, my God.

495
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,600
All right, don't answer that
if you're gonna puke again, please.

496
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,510
Meg said he paid the school directly.

497
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,150
Joni said he sent the money to her.

498
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,360
Both were true.

499
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,310
She was pocketing the double payment.

500
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,310
Harlan found out
and cut her off without a cent. Yes?

501
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,470
So she bumps him off for the inheritance?

502
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,550
Come on, no, have you seen her Insta?
She's an influencer.

503
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,830
No. Allowance as a motive?
Again, more weak sauce.

504
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,730
You're just dumpin' that vat
of weak sauce on me.

505
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,710
Granted. But she lied to me.

506
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,880
All three of them did.

507
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,960
Three?

508
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,590
Walter.

509
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,050
I see where you're going with this.

510
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,870
Harlan had turned Walter down before
regarding film rights,

511
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,390
but that night,
somethin' Harlan said shook him.

512
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,150
Now we look at the pattern.

513
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,070
Harlan was cleanin' house.

514
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,160
No wonder.

515
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,840
Did he plan to fire Walter?

516
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,160
Can I just wait inside?
I feel like I shouldn't be here.

517
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,550
Yeah, please, just wait inside.
Stay close, all right?

518
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,710
You have been very patient, my friend.

519
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,760
And yes,

520
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,320
you are right.

521
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,830
None of these weak alibis
and domestic squibbles

522
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,030
answer your question,

523
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,870
"Why is Benoit Blanc here?"

524
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,870
Well, now I will tell you why.

525
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:02,470
I'm here because this mornin',
someone dodged a very important question.

526
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,840
Who?

527
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,590
Me.

528
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,870
Linda asked who hired me.

529
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,000
Well, who hired you?

530
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,270
I do not know.

531
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,150
An envelope of cash showed up
at my apartment yesterday

532
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,430
with a news clippin' of Thrombey's death.

533
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,920
An envelope? That worked?

534
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,470
An envelope of cash.

535
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,790
So somebody suspects foul play

536
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:31,230
and goes through
this ha-cha dance of hiring me,

537
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,720
of staying anonymous.

538
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,830
It makes no damn sense.

539
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,040
Compels me, though.

540
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,030
Walk me through everyone's whereabouts
at the time of death.

541
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,430
We know that the party ended around 11:30.

542
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,920
- Good night, Joni.
- Night.

543
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,680
<i>Marta took Harlan upstairs
to give him his meds.</i>

544
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:59,500
<i>The stairs leading up to Harlan's bedroom
and his attic office creak horribly</i>

545
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,510
<i>and Linda is a light sleeper.</i>

546
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,430
<i>So we know every time
someone took the stairs that night.</i>

547
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,790
<i>The first was when Joni heard a ka-thunk</i>

548
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,670
<i>from somewhere above her in the house.</i>

549
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,630
<i>She's concerned about Harlan,
so she goes up to investigate.</i>

550
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,310
<i>Waking Linda.</i>

551
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,230
<i>Harlan was in his attic office with Marta.</i>

552
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,800
- Hi, JJoni.
- I just... Hi.

553
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,150
<i>He explained that they had
knocked over the Go board.</i>

554
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,730
I just knocked over the Go board, so...

555
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,550
<i>That game with the grid and stones.</i>

556
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,860
<i>They play it every night.</i>

557
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,150
<i>He was fine. "Go to bed."</i>

558
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,590
Go to bed, Joni.

559
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,230
- Love you. Night.
- Love you.

560
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,800
<i>- So she did.</i>
- Bye.

561
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,950
<i>Ten minutes later,
Linda is awoken a second time.</i>

562
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,200
<i>By Marta leaving.</i>

563
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,110
Walt, I'm leaving.

564
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,030
<i>Walt was smokin' a cigar
on the porch with his son.</i>

565
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,030
<i>He saw her leave and drive off.</i>

566
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,040
<i>Noted the time.</i>

567
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,630
<i>Midnight.</i>

568
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,310
<i>Fifteen minutes later,</i>

569
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,040
<i>Linda is awoken for the third
and final time...</i>

570
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,990
<i>...by someone coming down the stairs.</i>

571
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,470
<i>Harlan, who came down
for a midnight snack.</i>

572
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,150
Dad, go back to bed.

573
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,190
<i>Which Walt tried to discourage.</i>

574
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:28,070
<i>Based on this, the medical examiner
determined the time of death</i>

575
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,070
<i>to be between 12:15 and 2:00 a.m.</i>

576
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,940
<i>As Walt was finishing his cigar
at about 12:30, Meg came home.</i>

577
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,630
<i>She went straight to bed.</i>

578
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,990
<i>Walt and Jacob
turned in shortly after that.</i>

579
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,310
<i>And sometime later that night,</i>

580
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,350
<i>it's undetermined,
but possibly near 3:00 a.m.,</i>

581
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,000
<i>Meg woke up because
the dogs were barking outside.</i>

582
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,030
<i>She used the bathroom, went back to bed.</i>

583
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,510
That's it. All right?

584
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,350
Now, everyone's stories matched,

585
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,270
every moment accounted for.

586
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,510
And there is no other staircase
up to Harlan's room?

587
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,430
None. Just the creaky one.

588
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,670
Interesting.

589
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,550
So, uh, we know that Ransom didn't do it

590
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,960
because he wasn't there.

591
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,390
Marta couldn't have.

592
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,230
Harlan was still alive when she left.

593
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,750
- Yeah.
- Meg...

594
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,560
Meg came home during the window
of the time of death, right?

595
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,590
Except it was a suicide, all right?

596
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,790
Harlan slit right through his carotid.

597
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,950
We saw from the blood splat patterns
that they were uninterrupted,

598
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:28,710
meaning it's almost impossible for anyone
to have been around him at the time.

599
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,690
He's the one who cut his own throat.
I don't know why we keep goin' over this.

600
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,680
Physical evidence can tell a clear story
with a forked tongue.

601
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,350
- What?
- And as we can see from this mornin',

602
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,470
everyone can lie.

603
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,040
Well, almost everyone.

604
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,820
Miss Cabrera...

605
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:56,040
We kept you waiting all afternoon,
because I wanted to hear from you last.

606
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:01,230
I needed an entire picture
of the evening in my head,

607
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:05,390
and your piece of it
is at its very center.

608
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,030
So, please, take your time.

609
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:15,310
You took Mr. Thrombey upstairs at 11:30

610
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,480
and left at midnight.

611
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:23,190
Think very carefully
and with as much detail as possible.

612
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:27,070
Tell us what happened in that half hour?

613
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,110
- Up, up, up, I got it.
- You got it?

614
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,470
Up, up, up, I got it.
Up, up, up, I got it.

615
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,090
- Up, up, up, I got it.
- Okay, that's...

616
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,790
- Up, up, up, I got it.
- Hey, Harlan.

617
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,230
- Up, up, up, I got it.
- Let's...

618
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,640
Up, up, up, I got it.

619
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,470
- Okay.
- No second thoughts.

620
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,190
No. No, no, no, no.

621
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,970
- Get up here!
- I had a glass of champagne.

622
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,360
- Harlan, listen to me.
- We are...

623
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,130
- It's late. I had...
- You only had one glass.

624
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,640
Exactly. A glass of champagne.

625
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,910
We are not breaking tradition
on my birthday!

626
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,090
Can you just take your goddamn medicine
and go to bed?

627
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,670
If you're gonna put that vile shit in me,
you have to earn it.

628
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,430
On my birthday.

629
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,950
- Oh, God.
- Eighty-fifth birthday.

630
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,790
- Fine. Jesus!
- I'm so old.

631
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,030
- I'm so old.
- You really love drama, huh?

632
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,150
Okay, let's do this. Nine-by-nine.

633
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,310
- Right.
- You ready?

634
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,910
- I'll whip your ass.
- Are you sure?

635
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,270
Yeah. Yeah.

636
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,550
How dare you.

637
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,360
I know how this is gonna end.

638
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,630
What is that?

639
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,310
Why can't I beat you at this game?

640
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,550
Because I'm not playing to beat you.
I'm playing to build a beautiful pattern.

641
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,040
That's elder abuse.

642
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,670
I'm gonna call the AARP.

643
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,310
Don't make me get the belt, <i>abuelo.</i>

644
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,950
It's basically over.

645
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,390
My only hope
is that an earthquake will strike.

646
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,070
But what are the chances?

647
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,720
Hello?

648
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,390
Hello? Hello?

649
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,630
Hello? Get under a door frame!

650
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,310
Yes!

651
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,560
Such a bad loser you are! Meds, then bed.

652
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,750
I'm done with you.

653
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,030
That's fair.

654
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,630
Walt is smoking that filthy cigar
out there on the porch.

655
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,630
Dead and nasty things.

656
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,600
How was tonight?

657
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,230
Tonight was... good.

658
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,880
Oh, yeah?

659
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,270
I know you weren't looking forward to it.

660
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,680
No. But I did it.

661
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,790
I cut the line on all four of 'em.

662
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,280
Yeah.

663
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,150
Wasn't easy.

664
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,160
This goddamn fortune.

665
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,870
You know, sometimes I think
that everything I've given my family,

666
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,750
I've done maybe

667
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,670
without knowing,
or maybe to keep them beneath me.

668
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,310
I certainly should have...

669
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,760
I don't know, encouraged Walt

670
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,830
to write his own stories, not just be...

671
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,830
a caretaker of mine.

672
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,950
Like you said I should.

673
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,760
And then be a father
and not just a provider

674
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,230
for Joni, like you also said.

675
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,310
And I could have been kinder
to Linda and Ransom.

676
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,310
Jesus! Ransom.

677
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:14,510
There's so much of me in that kid.

678
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,360
Confident. Stupid.

679
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,590
I don't know, protected.

680
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,550
Playing life like a game,
without consequence.

681
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,710
Until you can't tell the difference

682
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,390
between a stage prop...

683
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,150
and a real knife.

684
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,030
You know, I don't fear death.

685
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,270
But, oh, God,

686
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,310
I'd like to fix some of this before I go.

687
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,510
Close the book with a flourish.

688
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,040
I guess we'll see.

689
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,350
I guess we will.

690
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,960
Hey.

691
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,670
You had a long day.

692
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,870
You wanna do drugs?

693
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,790
You mean the good stuff?

694
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,150
Yeah?

695
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:11,350
Oh, come on, send me to la-la land.

696
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,910
Just a tiny bit, okay?

697
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,750
Why did I wait till my mid-age
to become a morphine user?

698
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,910
What a schmuck.

699
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,670
What a nudnik. This...

700
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,030
This stuff is the best.

701
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,670
Oh, my God.

702
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,350
Is there a problem?

703
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,430
This is what I just gave you
100 milligrams of.

704
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,510
I messed up.

705
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:44,150
You gave me 100 milligrams
of the good stuff?

706
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:50,110
Excuse me, but what is the good stuff's
dosage supposed to be?

707
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,310
Let's not call it that right now, okay?

708
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,870
Three milligrams.

709
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,110
Oh, that's much less.

710
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,470
So what happens?

711
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,030
I'm gonna give you
an emergency shot of Naloxone,

712
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,750
so you don't die in ten minutes.

713
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,110
Oh, well, no pressure.

714
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,430
You know, this is an interesting

715
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,980
and efficient method of murder.

716
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,520
I need to write this down.

717
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:14,710
So, if someone switched
the meds on purpose,

718
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,310
I'd be dead in ten minutes.

719
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,150
- Like stone-cold dead?
- Yes.

720
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,640
You'll feel symptoms in five.

721
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,270
Sweats, disorientation, and then...

722
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,270
Yes. That big dose injected,
within ten, your...

723
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,310
Your brain...

724
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,950
Yes, ten minutes.

725
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,440
From the moment of injection?

726
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,520
It's eight-ish now.

727
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,190
And even if the victim called
for an ambulance

728
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,790
when he first felt the symptoms

729
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,270
and if he lived in a great
big country house like we do,

730
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:46,270
the ambulance would take
at least 15 minutes to arrive

731
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,990
and then it'd be too late.

732
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,550
If the victim didn't have
the emergency Naxostuff.

733
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,800
Marta?

734
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,950
- Do you have the Naxostuff?
- Yes, I'm gonna find it.

735
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,750
I have it because it comes with the kit,
so it should be here. It has to be.

736
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,550
It's like...

737
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,750
It's not here, Harlan.

738
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,150
I don't know why it's not here.

739
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,830
So, I'm gonna use the phone, okay?

740
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,990
To call an ambulance.

741
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,950
What are you doing?

742
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,020
What are you doing?

743
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,950
Marta, listen to me.

744
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,360
- Harlan, I need to call the ambulance.
- Stop this, Marta!

745
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,360
- There's no time! You have to listen!
- I'm calling the family!

746
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,670
What are you doing?

747
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,160
Are you nuts?

748
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,950
- Harlan, we have to call the ambulance.
- Listen to me. Listen to me!

749
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,510
Now, if what you said is true, I'm gone.
There's no saving me.

750
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,600
No, no.

751
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,030
We have six minutes.

752
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,950
- No, I can't...
- We have got to get you out of this!

753
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,440
Think of your mom.

754
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,920
My mom?

755
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,350
Marta, get behind me, get behind me.

756
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,510
Don't make a noise.

757
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,630
Harlan?

758
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,590
Marta?

759
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,160
Everything all right?

760
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,800
- Oh, hi, Joni.
- I thought I... Hi.

761
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,790
I thought I heard something.
Is everything okay?

762
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,710
No, no. We're fine. We're fine.

763
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,870
Well, I just knocked over this Go board.
Sorry about that.

764
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,710
- Everyone's all right?
- Yeah, fine.

765
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,070
No, no. Go to bed, Joni.

766
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,790
Okay.

767
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,150
Maybe we can talk tomorrow
about the family...

768
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,640
Tomorrow's fine.

769
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,590
- Good night. Love you. Night.
- Love you. Bye.

770
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,960
Come on.

771
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,670
Pay attention, now.

772
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:58,790
Your mom is still undocumented.

773
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,430
And if this is your fault,

774
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:03,080
she'll be found out and at best deported,

775
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,150
and your family will be broken.

776
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:08,230
We're not gonna let that happen,
are we, huh?

777
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,470
But you have to do exactly
what I tell you.

778
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,950
Will you do this, Marta?

779
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,790
This last thing...

780
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,830
for me, for your family?

781
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,150
What do you want me to do?

782
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,790
<i>Go downstairs as noisily as you can</i>

783
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,360
<i>and then say goodbye loudly.</i>

784
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,550
Walt, I'm leaving.

785
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:34,310
<i>- Call attention to the time...</i>
- God, it's midnight already.

786
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,510
<i>...if you can.</i>

787
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,510
<i>Drive out the gate.</i>

788
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,470
<i>Then to avoid the security cameras,</i>

789
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,550
<i>pull off the road
before the carved elephant.</i>

790
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,310
- Wait. Was it before or after?
<i>- After the carved elephant.</i>

791
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,430
No, he said before. Was it?

792
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:53,240
<i>- Beafterfore the carved elephant.</i>
- Oh, shit.

793
00:40:56,840 --> 00:41:00,510
<i>Park, and come back
on foot up to the house.</i>

794
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,310
<i>Take the side yard pass
through the little gate.</i>

795
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,070
<i>The dogs will know you.
They shouldn't bark.</i>

796
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,510
<i>You've got to get up to the third floor
without being seen.</i>

797
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,830
<i>And the only way
is to climb the side trellis</i>

798
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,310
<i>and come in through the trick hall window.</i>

799
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,110
You gotta be kidding me.

800
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,870
<i>I am not. Do it.</i>

801
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:32,830
<i>And for God's sake, don't make any noise!</i>

802
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,870
<i>Once you're inside,
and this is the tricky part...</i>

803
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,280
<i>This is the tricky part?</i>

804
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,790
<i>Get my robe and cap from my bedroom</i>

805
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,310
<i>and put them on.</i>

806
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,430
<i>Harlan...</i>

807
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,350
This is crazy.
I don't think I can do that.

808
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,310
No, we need to make this so airtight
that the average cop

809
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,790
will entirely dismiss you as a suspect.

810
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,110
It sounds crazy, but it'll work.

811
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:10,560
<i>Walt is smoking outside, and he'll see you</i>

812
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,120
<i>through the glazed window.</i>

813
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,270
Dad? Go back to bed.

814
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,200
<i>You were seen leaving.</i>

815
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,740
<i>The security cameras show you driving off.</i>

816
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,430
<i>And 20 minutes later,</i>

817
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,470
<i>I'm seen alive and well by my son.</i>

818
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:29,030
<i>You see,
you've gone from suspect number one</i>

819
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,910
<i>to an impossibility.</i>

820
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,510
<i>Leave the way you came</i>

821
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:35,750
<i>and don't be seen.</i>

822
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,630
Ransom?

823
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:51,150
Are you back again already?

824
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:55,950
<i>Drive home.</i>

825
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:00,320
<i>And sometime in the next few days,
the police will question you.</i>

826
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:03,030
No. No, no, no.

827
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,670
No, I can't lie!

828
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,230
You know I can't lie! I'll puke!

829
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:10,070
Well, then don't lie.
Tell fragments of the truth.

830
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,560
In this exact order.

831
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,310
I took him upstairs.

832
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,710
We played our nightly game of Go.

833
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,990
At some point, he knocked the board over

834
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,990
and Joni came up to check on us.

835
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,310
I gave him pain medication.

836
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,910
He pulled his shoulder last week.

837
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,830
And I left him in his study.

838
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:45,820
At midnight

839
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,070
I said goodbye to Walt...

840
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,470
went home.

841
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,200
What kind of medication did you give him?

842
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:00,470
Since his injury, I've been giving him
100 milligram IV push of Toradol.

843
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,590
It's a non-narcotic analgesic.

844
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,990
And to help him sleep,

845
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:07,230
three milligrams of morphine.

846
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:09,030
And the family was aware of this?

847
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,760
Yes, of course.

848
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:14,590
Did you notice anything strange
or off about his demeanor?

849
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:19,590
No.

850
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,430
Well, that sounds about right.

851
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,270
Thank you, Miss Cabrera.

852
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:50,630
Hey, sis, people are gonna get here
for the memorial pretty soon.

853
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:51,720
Are you...

854
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:56,000
Are you all right?

855
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,830
I was just thinking about Dad's games.

856
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,480
This all feels like one.

857
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:06,080
Like something he'd write, not do.

858
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,910
I keep waiting for the big reveal.

859
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,280
Where it'll make sense.

860
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,550
Wouldn't that be nice?

861
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:17,830
Oh, Walt.

862
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,830
<i>I don't think he killed himself.</i>

863
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,590
I don't. I really don't.

864
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,190
There's this Hallmark movie

865
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,550
called <i>Deadly by Surprise</i>
with Danica McKellar.

866
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:33,600
And in it, she plays this wife
who's getting poisoned by her husband,

867
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,270
but he's doing it little by little,
so she doesn't know it

868
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:38,750
and she goes crazy, and she kills herself.

869
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,310
And my cousin, who's a receptionist
at the medical examiner's office,

870
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,350
she says that stuff totally happens.

871
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:47,630
It's not even 3% as crazy as
the stuff she's seen come through there.

872
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:48,750
So, I'm just like...

873
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:51,950
Oh, God, yeah!

874
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,150
I mean, don't like him
because you love him.

875
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,990
No, I don't like him. He's an asshole.

876
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:59,270
But maybe an asshole is what we needed.

877
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,950
Oh, my God, yeah,

878
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,630
an asshole is what Germany needed

879
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,550
- in 1930-whatever.
- Here we go.

880
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,680
Come on, Joni, those two things
don't even conflate.

881
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:09,150
- There is the problem right there.
- Jesus.

882
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,260
I'm gonna disappear
until the politics talk is done.

883
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:13,760
You want some champers?

884
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:16,230
I can't. I'm technically working.

885
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:19,430
Why don't you take off your red cap,
Richard, and look around you?

886
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,350
The streets are literally
flooded with Nazis.

887
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,840
No, no, no. No, no, no.

888
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:25,950
We are losing our way of life
and our culture.

889
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,550
- That's right.
- There are millions

890
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,240
- of Mexicans coming.
- Oh, God, really?

891
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,690
Don't make this a race thing.
You always make this a race thing.

892
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:34,110
I would say the same thing
if they were European immigrants.

893
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,310
Oh, yeah? So, if the Swiss were, like,

894
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,400
- clogging in the streets...
- No, we allow them in

895
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,710
and they think they own what's ours.

896
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,910
They're putting children in cages!
I mean, these are camps!

897
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,510
Come on, Joni,
nobody's saying that isn't bad,

898
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,790
but the parents have some blame here.

899
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,310
Oh, for what? For wanting
a better life for their kids?

900
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:54,190
- Isn't that what America is...
- For breaking the law!

901
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,740
- My God.
- You're gonna hate hearing this,

902
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:59,710
- but it's true, America is for Americans.
- Don't point at me.

903
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:02,470
- Where's Marta? Is she still here? Marta!
- Oh, God, don't.

904
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:03,880
- Come on over.
- No, Richard.

905
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,390
- Come on over, Marta. Please.
- You're shitting me.

906
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:07,800
Marta,

907
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:11,760
your family is from Uruguay,
but you did it right.

908
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:14,230
I mean, what I'm saying is
they did it legally.

909
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:16,190
She did it the right way.

910
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:20,190
You work hard, and you'll earn your share
from the ground up.

911
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:24,350
Just like Dad and like all the rest of us.
And I'll bet you agree with me, right?

912
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:26,870
Oh, just leave the poor girl alone,
Richard.

913
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,470
It's okay! I just wanna hear
what she has to say!

914
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:30,840
It's okay, Marta, you can speak.

915
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,770
Sweetheart, don't feel
pressure to answer. This is just...

916
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:33,720
Look.

917
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:36,510
- Please don't.
- If you wanna become an American,

918
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:39,060
there are legal ways to do it.

919
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:43,040
But if you break the law,
it doesn't matter how good your heart is,

920
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:45,790
you gotta face the consequences!

921
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,360
Are you goddamn insane?

922
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,630
- It's done.
- Hey! I'm warning you.

923
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:58,910
That's when I ask her, "Tonya,
what is wrong with people?" Literally.

924
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,950
Oh, my God! Marta, what?

925
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:03,310
Marta?

926
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:04,510
What's the matter?

927
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,750
Whoa, whoa. Hey. Breathe.

928
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:08,790
- Oh, my gosh.
- Marta, are you okay?

929
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:12,030
Hey, Fran, do you still have your stash?

930
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:19,040
Take 'em whenever you need 'em.

931
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:21,550
They're just drying out
since you gave me that Juul.

932
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:23,040
Thanks, Fran.

933
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:24,910
- Hey. Hey.
- I'm sorry.

934
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
- No, just...
- I'm sorry.

935
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:27,300
I'm very, very sorry.

936
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,550
- Stop saying you're sorry. Jesus!
- I hate this.

937
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:32,280
Oh, God, my heart won't stop. I can't...

938
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,630
It's just everything... No, thank you.

939
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:40,510
That's where Fran keeps her stash?

940
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,750
Who's gonna open a clock?

941
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:46,830
Do you want dinner, Nana?

942
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,070
Dinner? To eat?

943
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:51,470
- To eat?
- Walt.

944
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:53,040
- Nana?
- Walt, Walt, she's fine.

945
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:55,310
She ate the entire salmon spread already.

946
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:59,710
Walt? Did you tell Marta yet,
what we all talked about?

947
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,590
No, not yet. Is now a good time?

948
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,630
Yes. Yes, a very good time, right now.

949
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,120
Oh, okay.

950
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:07,190
All right. Calm down.

951
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:10,630
Marta,

952
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:13,700
we've been talking it over and...

953
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,830
- Have you been smoking grass?
- No.

954
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:19,920
Come on.

955
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,630
Marta, we've been talking it over,

956
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:23,750
and the whole family,

957
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,030
we'd like to take care of you.

958
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,830
Wha... What does that mean?

959
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:32,070
We all think that you deserve something.

960
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,230
Financially we'd like to help you out.

961
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,990
You were never anything but good to Dad

962
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,470
and because of that we...

963
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:41,870
You can count on us.

964
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:43,870
Yeah.

965
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,630
I thought you should've been
at the funeral.

966
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,630
By the way, I was outvoted.

967
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:02,870
Detective.

968
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,080
You're still here?

969
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,030
Did you know Harlan?

970
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:16,870
He knew my father,
who was a police detective years ago.

971
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:20,990
My father respected Harlan.

972
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:23,550
That says quite a lot.

973
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:24,990
Is that why you're here?

974
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,150
Here now, here?

975
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:29,640
No.

976
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,390
I stayed hoping to speak to you
a little more.

977
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,950
Something is afoot with this whole affair.

978
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,470
I know it.

979
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,950
I believe you know it, too.

980
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,020
So you're gonna keep digging?

981
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:53,230
Harlan's detectives, they dig.

982
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:55,630
They rifle and root.

983
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:57,350
Truffle pigs.

984
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:03,000
I anticipate the terminus
of <i>Gravity's Rainbow.</i>

985
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:05,070
<i>Gravity's Rainbow?</i>

986
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:06,910
It's a novel.

987
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,310
Yeah, I know.

988
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,910
- I haven't read it though.
- Neither have I.

989
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,630
Nobody has. But I like the title.

990
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:19,270
It describes the path of a projectile
determined by natural law.

991
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:21,710
<i>Et voilÃ ,</i> my method.

992
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:25,910
I observe the facts
without biases of the head or heart.

993
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,070
I determine the arc's path,
stroll leisurely to its terminus,

994
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:33,240
and the truth falls at my feet.

995
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:39,070
The medical examiner was ready
to rule this a suicide,

996
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:42,190
but Elliott agreed to keep it pending
for 48 hours.

997
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,190
Tomorrow morning,
I search the grounds and the house,

998
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,790
begin my investigation.

999
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,990
I want you to be by my side for it.

1000
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:51,550
- What?
- My confidante.

1001
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:54,430
- My eyes and ears.
- Hey. Wait, wait, Detective. Why me?

1002
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:57,190
I trust your kind heart.

1003
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:01,920
Also, you're the only one who had nothing
to gain from Harlan's death.

1004
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:04,880
So how about it, Watson?

1005
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,150
Hey, Detective?

1006
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,470
If you want my insight into the family...

1007
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,240
None of them are murderers.

1008
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:14,110
That's my insight.

1009
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:15,390
And yet,

1010
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:17,990
be it cruel or comforting,

1011
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:22,070
this machine unerringly
arrives at the truth.

1012
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,590
That's what it does.

1013
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,150
Always?

1014
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:29,500
Tomorrow at 8:00.

1015
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:03,390
<i>I know I've missed something.
There's gonna be something I missed.</i>

1016
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,790
<i>- Harlan. No, I can't.
- But I know you can do this.</i>

1017
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:08,950
Without losing your soul,
you have to do what you have to do...

1018
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:10,560
- No.
- ...to beat this and win.

1019
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:11,830
Harlan, I can't.

1020
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,990
- You can. And you have to.
- No.

1021
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:16,510
For me.

1022
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:17,920
Right now!

1023
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:39,510
Harlan, I have to get you help.

1024
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:42,270
You do as I say...

1025
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:46,150
and everything will be just fine.

1026
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:47,430
No.

1027
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,270
- No.
- I promise.

1028
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:52,230
But...

1029
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:03,430
Fifty years ago, I worked this estate.

1030
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:06,350
You know, security back then was such that

1031
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:11,990
you had to make the rounds with a 94
and keep your ears open.

1032
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:16,630
Now you've got all this modern technology.

1033
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:19,630
Now, that's the video there.

1034
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:22,070
I saved the tape from that night.

1035
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:25,950
Normally, I erase 'em
with a magnetic degausser,

1036
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:29,110
but in this case,
I thought I'd just save it, you know?

1037
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,790
For security.

1038
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:33,390
Now, that's a live feed there.

1039
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,030
<i>To avoid the security cameras,</i>

1040
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:39,710
<i>pull off the road
after the carved elephant.</i>

1041
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:41,950
All right, well,
can we see the actual tape?

1042
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:43,870
Well, of course you can.

1043
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:46,110
I recorded it SSLP.

1044
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:47,950
There's eight hours in that tape.

1045
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:50,270
9:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m.

1046
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:02,070
Looks like a Japanese horror movie.

1047
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,190
You think we could scan forward on that?

1048
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:05,710
Are we all gonna die in seven days?

1049
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:06,910
How can we scan forward?

1050
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,510
Oh, yeah, just hold the play button down

1051
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:12,910
and press FF until you hear it grind.

1052
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:20,910
All right. Should be coming up now

1053
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,480
to the time when the party ended.

1054
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,350
What happened?

1055
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,670
You gotta keep holding it down
or else it'll eject.

1056
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,030
That thing eats tapes like popcorn.

1057
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:35,590
You think your guys can digitize this
so we could scan it properly?

1058
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:36,900
Yeah, I think we can do that.

1059
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:39,150
I got it.

1060
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:43,790
You know all these statues
that you see around here?

1061
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:47,150
They're all straight out of his series,
<i>The Menagerie Tragedy Trilogy.</i>

1062
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:49,150
- Pretty cool.
- Awesome.

1063
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:50,640
Yeah.

1064
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:52,790
Benny, it's beautiful out here,

1065
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:55,760
but do you really think someone broke
into the house and murdered Harlan?

1066
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:58,150
- Is that why we're out here?
- It is unlikely,

1067
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:00,750
but if they did, there will be traces.

1068
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:03,350
- I can hang on to that.
- Yeah.

1069
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:14,190
Hey, Wagner, you got any luck on...

1070
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:17,190
- Uh, what's-his-name?
- Ransom?

1071
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,070
- Yeah.
- No.

1072
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:21,470
Did get an address though.

1073
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:24,790
- Yeah?
- 10 Kenoak Street.

1074
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:27,470
10... Kenoak?

1075
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:29,080
Kenoak.

1076
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,390
It's a pleasant thing to say, isn't it?

1077
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,140
Kenoak.

1078
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,960
I awoke amid Kenoak.

1079
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:40,190
- That's funny. Ken-oh-kia.
- All these leaves and mud,

1080
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:42,840
they're really gonna do
a number on my boots, man.

1081
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:46,110
Mud. Did it rain the past week
or something?

1082
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:47,550
- No, stay there!
- What?

1083
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:48,710
Whoa!

1084
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:49,870
Okay.

1085
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:51,790
We got footprints here, so, uh...

1086
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,150
I wanna, um...

1087
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:54,950
Marta.

1088
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:56,680
- Stop.
- What?

1089
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:57,830
What?

1090
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:59,240
Marta, stay there.

1091
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:01,390
- What?
- No, Marta! Stay there, Marta.

1092
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:02,890
- No! No!
- I couldn't hear. If you...

1093
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:04,190
- Did you call me?
- All right.

1094
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:05,990
- Excuse me. Come here.
- All right.

1095
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:08,370
We're gonna need to call the boys,
have 'em come down here,

1096
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:09,750
take a look at all these tracks.

1097
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:12,110
- Get it taped off. Stay on that side.
- I'm sorry.

1098
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:13,950
- Watch out.
- Okay.

1099
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:16,260
Hey! Yeah!

1100
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:18,630
Hussie? Hussie, hey.

1101
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:22,110
Best judge of character is a dog.

1102
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:24,790
- Good boy.
- I've found that to be true.

1103
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:28,320
I'd...

1104
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:30,600
Yes!

1105
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:32,910
My puppies!

1106
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:36,670
Yeah, well, they've got plans
to read the will at around 10:00,

1107
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,030
so the whole family will be here soon.

1108
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:44,200
- I've never been to a will reading.
- Oh, well...

1109
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:46,950
You think it'd be like a game show,

1110
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:51,220
but think of a community theater
production of a tax return.

1111
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:54,790
So, what are we looking for?

1112
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:56,030
Oh, you know,

1113
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:58,790
anything suspicious
or out of the ordinary.

1114
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,750
You'll know it when you see it.

1115
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:02,640
Oh, my God.

1116
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:05,430
Sweet beans!

1117
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:10,710
Well...

1118
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,230
Good morning, Mrs. Thrombey.

1119
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:24,110
You think you could handle the study?

1120
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:36,390
Where's your medical bag?

1121
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,550
I don't know. I left it here.

1122
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:40,360
I always leave it here
with Harlan at night.

1123
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:43,310
They must have taken it in as evidence.
I'll look into that.

1124
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,220
Shit.

1125
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:55,190
How'd the Go board get knocked over?

1126
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:57,150
We were just goofing around.

1127
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,070
What are you thinking?

1128
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:18,190
No! No, no, no! Hey! Hey! Hey!

1129
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:19,550
Oh, let me guess.

1130
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:21,710
Hey! Stop. Stop.

1131
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:23,400
Stop. Stop.

1132
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:26,030
Hugh Drysdale?

1133
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:29,670
Ransom. Call me Ransom.
It's my middle name.

1134
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:31,270
Only the help calls me Hugh.

1135
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:34,550
- Okay.
- This is Trooper Wagner.

1136
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,220
I'm Lieutenant Elliott.

1137
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:38,630
We just wanna ask a few questions.

1138
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:44,020
Excuse me?

1139
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:46,190
Sir?

1140
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:47,760
We're officers of the law!

1141
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:51,150
You gonna run me in?
I don't feel like talking. I'm distraught.

1142
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:53,710
Hey, Benny, you wanna ask
this guy some questions?

1143
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:56,440
- What is this? What's this arrangement?
- Mr. Drysdale.

1144
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:59,110
CSI KFC?

1145
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:07,190
Hey, Frannie,
how about a glass of cold milk?

1146
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:08,680
Hey, asshole.

1147
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:10,240
Not her name, not her job.

1148
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:13,030
Hey, Meg. How's the SJW degree coming?

1149
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:16,830
- Trust fund prick.
- All right, guys.

1150
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:18,140
Hey.

1151
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:19,870
Hey. Everyone.

1152
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:22,670
I'm just gonna be
in the other room, setting up.

1153
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:24,190
Be ready in ten minutes.

1154
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:33,790
Funny, Ransom, you skipped the funeral,
but you're early for the will reading.

1155
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:38,950
Okay, people grieve in different ways.
Let's not...

1156
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:40,830
You know what?
It's funny you're here at all.

1157
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:43,510
Why are you even bothering?
That's what I'm asking myself.

1158
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:45,110
What's that supposed to mean?

1159
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:46,790
He knows what it's supposed to mean.

1160
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:48,790
Wait... Walt, what?

1161
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:53,750
Jacob was in that bathroom
the night of the party.

1162
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:57,430
That's where you were all night?

1163
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:00,110
What the hell were you doing
in the bathroom all night?

1164
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:01,870
- Nothing.
- Swatting Syrian refugees?

1165
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:04,110
- No, I was not.
- Alt-right troll.

1166
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:05,270
Liberal snowflake.

1167
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:06,950
I don't know what any of that means.

1168
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:08,670
It means your son's a little creep.

1169
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:11,360
My son's a creep?

1170
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:12,440
Guys, just...

1171
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:14,280
Walt, he was in the bathroom.

1172
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:15,760
Yeah, he was in the bathroom.

1173
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:18,560
Joylessly masturbating
to pictures of dead deer.

1174
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:22,320
You know what, Richard? You wanna go?

1175
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:24,150
You bet, skippy, let's go.

1176
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:25,390
You wanna go? Come on!

1177
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:26,880
You better watch out, man.

1178
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:29,420
- No!
- Stop!

1179
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:32,270
Come on, I have been waiting
for this my whole life!

1180
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:34,630
- Stop it, right now!
- Donna, I can handle myself!

1181
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:35,990
- Stop it!
- I can handle it.

1182
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:37,190
Oh, my God.

1183
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:39,630
We gotta do this more often.

1184
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:40,720
Hey!

1185
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:42,360
Jacob.

1186
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:44,190
We know where this is going.

1187
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:46,310
You were in the bathroom
next to Harlan's office,

1188
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:48,030
where he had the fight with Ransom.

1189
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:49,630
Now, you heard something.

1190
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:50,790
Spill it.

1191
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:54,510
I just heard two things.

1192
01:02:58,200 --> 01:02:59,200
...my will.

1193
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:00,750
"My will."

1194
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:04,030
And then there was more yelling.

1195
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:07,070
And then I heard Ransom say...

1196
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:09,350
"I'm warning you."

1197
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:14,550
Ransom...

1198
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:16,910
What's that mean?

1199
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,310
I think it means our father
finally came to his senses

1200
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:22,390
and cut this worthless little brat
out of his will.

1201
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:25,310
So I guess you're gonna have
to sell the Beemer

1202
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:29,310
and give your notice at the country club
and kick whatever fashion drug you're on.

1203
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:32,950
Because if you think
that after all the bridges you've burned,

1204
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:34,190
after all the shit you said,

1205
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:36,550
after everything that you put
this family through

1206
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:37,910
for the last ten years,

1207
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:40,230
that any of us are gonna support you,

1208
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:44,390
that any of us are gonna give you,
like Dad liked to say,

1209
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:46,790
"a single red dime,"

1210
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,030
you're nuts!

1211
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:50,750
Wow.

1212
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:53,630
Son...

1213
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:55,720
Father.

1214
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:59,910
Did Harlan tell you
he was gonna cut you out of the will?

1215
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:02,880
Yep.

1216
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:10,310
Well, then he's done
what none of us were strong enough to do.

1217
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:15,150
Maybe this might finally make you grow up.

1218
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:20,590
This might be the best thing
that could ever happen to you.

1219
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:23,190
Thank you.
My mother, ladies and gentlemen.

1220
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:25,310
Look, this is not gonna be easy for you,

1221
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:27,270
but it'll be good.

1222
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:29,150
Nothing good is ever easy.

1223
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:30,920
Up your ass, Joni.

1224
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,320
You've had your teeth
in this family's tit for a long time.

1225
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:35,350
"Up your ass"? Oh, very nice.

1226
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:37,470
- Matter of fact, eat shit.
- Oh, my God, Ransom.

1227
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:38,670
- What?
- How's that?

1228
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:40,570
Please do not use that word
in front of my son.

1229
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:42,490
- In fact, eat shit. Eat shit.
- If I wasn't practicing...

1230
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:43,800
- Eat shit.
- You entitled prick!

1231
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:45,190
I would slap that smug smile...

1232
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:47,240
- Definitely eat shit.
- ...off your goddamn face!

1233
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:48,990
Eat shit. You can all eat shit.

1234
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:53,670
I'm not eating one iota of shit!

1235
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:58,230
What was that about
will readings being boring?

1236
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:00,790
The exception that proves the rule.

1237
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:04,440
Asshole.

1238
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:07,350
"I'm warning you."

1239
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,150
Ransom said, "I'm warning you."

1240
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:13,510
Well, you heard Ransom in there.
That's the kind of thing he says.

1241
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:15,790
You want this? You want this?

1242
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:22,070
What do we have here?

1243
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:31,270
This looks like a relatively fresh break.

1244
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:33,390
Yep. Right there.

1245
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:35,200
Wait a minute.

1246
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:37,590
Well, that doesn't make sense.

1247
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:39,800
Where's that window?

1248
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:42,550
How about some more cookies, Hugh?

1249
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:44,430
- You want some more cookies?
- That's great.

1250
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:49,990
Hey, maybe Harlan left you
a cold glass of milk in his will. Asshole.

1251
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:53,990
Show me. But stay off the carpet.

1252
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:10,030
It's the trick window

1253
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,910
from <i>A Kill For All Seasons.</i>

1254
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,790
Trooper, here, will you? Take this.

1255
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:29,550
Traces of dried mud.

1256
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:32,910
I suspect they go
the length of the hallway.

1257
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:34,920
Footprints?

1258
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,950
No, just traces.

1259
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:39,390
Yeah, depending on when
this thing was last cleaned,

1260
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:42,990
this could have happened
at any time, right?

1261
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:45,110
No, that would not explain this.

1262
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:48,030
Analyze that mud.

1263
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:49,750
It will match these traces.

1264
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:52,590
- Take this to Jamie.
- You will find similar samples

1265
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:54,710
leading up the trellis
on the outside of the house.

1266
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:57,030
On the night of the party,

1267
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:59,790
somebody who did not want
to be heard climbing those steps

1268
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:03,350
went to a great deal of trouble
to break into Harlan Thrombey's rooms.

1269
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:07,190
The game is afoot, eh, Watson?

1270
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:20,990
Well, thank you all
for getting together like this.

1271
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:23,310
It isn't legally necessary,

1272
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:26,550
but I thought because you're all in town,
and some of you are leaving soon...

1273
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:27,790
Excuse me.

1274
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:29,310
I'm sorry.

1275
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:33,070
Ladies and gentlemen,
I would like to gently request

1276
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:36,990
that you all stay in town
until the investigation is completed.

1277
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:38,870
Yeah, well, he's gently requesting,

1278
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,570
but I'm gonna have to make that an order.

1279
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:42,550
No one move until we figure this all out.

1280
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,710
- What?
- Can we ask why?

1281
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:46,390
- Has something changed?
- No.

1282
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:48,470
No, it hasn't changed?
Or no, we can't ask?

1283
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:50,110
Mr. Stevens...

1284
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:51,520
you may continue.

1285
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,220
Right. Well...

1286
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:57,510
The other reason I thought
this gathering would be beneficial

1287
01:07:57,600 --> 01:08:02,470
is because Harlan altered his will
a week before he died.

1288
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:04,190
He sealed it.

1289
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:06,630
He asked me not to submit it to the courts

1290
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:08,230
for probate until after his death.

1291
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:11,150
So, if anyone is confused about anything,

1292
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:13,550
we're all together, we can talk.

1293
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:17,710
Although I don't imagine any of it
is going to be that complicated.

1294
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:19,790
Harlan's assets included...

1295
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:22,280
- The house.
- The house,

1296
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:24,110
which he owned outright.

1297
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:26,270
- Um...
- $60 million.

1298
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:30,470
Yes. $60 million in various cash accounts
and investments.

1299
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:32,040
And of course,

1300
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:33,680
the real asset,

1301
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:37,900
sole ownership of Blood Like Wine,
his publishing company.

1302
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,510
He also wrote up a statement
when he was making the changes

1303
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:43,190
and he wanted that read first.

1304
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:48,950
"Dearest Linda, Walter, and Joni,

1305
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:51,680
Some of you may be surprised
by the choice I've made here.

1306
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:54,190
No pleasure was taken in the exclusion.

1307
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:57,150
And its purpose was not to sow
greater discord in the family,

1308
01:08:57,680 --> 01:08:58,870
quite the opposite.

1309
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:02,950
Please accept it with grace
and without bitterness, but do accept it.

1310
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:05,390
It's for the best. Dad."

1311
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:22,190
Wow. Well, yeah, not too complex at all.

1312
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:23,670
This will be quick.

1313
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:28,870
"I, Harlan Thrombey,
being of sound mind and body

1314
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:31,110
and yada, yada, yada...

1315
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:35,710
I hereby direct that all my assets,
both liquid and otherwise,

1316
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:39,350
I leave in their entirety
to Marta Cabrera.

1317
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:43,990
My entire ownership
of Blood Like Wine publishing,

1318
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:46,870
I leave in its entirety to Marta Cabrera.

1319
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:48,910
The copyright of its catalog likewise

1320
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,790
I leave in its entirety to Marta Cabrera."

1321
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:57,190
What?

1322
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:02,870
- What?
- No.

1323
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:06,110
- That's not... That's... No.
- No.

1324
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:08,150
That can't be.
Can I see that please, Alan?

1325
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:09,720
- Yeah. It's right.
- Please.

1326
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:12,070
- This can't be legal.
- It's right.

1327
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:14,230
- You know, he was...
- Oh, my God.

1328
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:16,670
- Aren't there safeguards?
- There's a mistake.

1329
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:18,030
I don't know what to say.

1330
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:19,150
We're his family, so...

1331
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:20,880
It's not possible.

1332
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:22,910
Are there safeguards against this?

1333
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,230
Wasn't in his right mind? Something...

1334
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:28,750
- You know, Alan, listen.
- You know, he was on medication.

1335
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,230
Morphine? All right, morphine.

1336
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:32,590
I mean, I don't know.

1337
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:34,450
- She seems like family...
- Alan, you can take

1338
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:39,030
this piece of paper and shove it
right up your ass, and get out!

1339
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:40,600
And, you cops, too, out.

1340
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:42,230
Out! Right now.

1341
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:44,430
- Hey, Linda?
- No, Richard, we need to talk.

1342
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:47,190
We need to fight this thing.
We're not going anywhere.

1343
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:49,030
I said get out!

1344
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:51,870
We are the Thrombeys, goddamn it!

1345
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:53,670
This is still our house!

1346
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:02,420
Oh, sorry.

1347
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:06,820
"Likewise the house at 2 Deerborn Drive
and all belongings therein,

1348
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:08,750
I leave to Marta Cabrera."

1349
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:13,470
Oh, you little bitch!

1350
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:16,070
- You little bitch!
- Linda?

1351
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:18,570
Did you know about this?
Were you in on this from the beginning?

1352
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:20,480
- This is unbelievable!
- No, I just wanna know.

1353
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:22,270
What were you... What were you doing?

1354
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:23,790
Were you boinking my father?

1355
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:25,470
- "Boinking"?
- No, no, no.

1356
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:27,510
I think everybody just needs
to cool their jets.

1357
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:30,060
You had sex with my grandpa,
you dirty anchor baby!

1358
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:31,270
Now hold your horses.

1359
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:32,990
And in the meantime, I'd maybe run.

1360
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:34,560
Wait, wait, wait, Marta?

1361
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:37,100
- Now, would you please...
- You need to talk to us.

1362
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:38,790
Marta?

1363
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:42,000
Wait a minute. I totally understand how
you must be feeling right now.

1364
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:43,480
You cannot leave!

1365
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:45,910
I don't know what to say. I don't know.

1366
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,910
- Calm down. Calm down.
- Marta, please...

1367
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,710
Marta, listen, darling...

1368
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:53,150
I don't know what's happening.
I don't know why he...

1369
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:56,270
Guys, I'm also confused. I need to think!

1370
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:58,350
Marta! Are you listening?

1371
01:11:58,440 --> 01:11:59,710
I can't catch up!

1372
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:03,980
- I understand.
- Richard! Open up that door!

1373
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:05,970
- You are scaring her!
- I can't open the damn door!

1374
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,790
Marta, go. Marta, go.

1375
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:09,710
Marta, you have to understand.

1376
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:11,790
He is our father!

1377
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:14,870
- Marta, listen to me.
- Don't listen to them. I'm here.

1378
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:16,990
I'm not on Twitter anymore.

1379
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:20,190
So DM me on Instagram, okay?

1380
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:21,430
I wanna talk to you.

1381
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:27,870
Ransom!

1382
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:29,440
What the hell's going on?

1383
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:32,190
I think this could be the best thing
to happen to all of you!

1384
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:35,790
What does he mean by that?

1385
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:39,030
Richard, why didn't you stop her?

1386
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:41,870
What am I supposed to do?
Grab the bumper with my teeth?

1387
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:54,670
Okay, seriously, though, what the hell?

1388
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:01,470
Hey. I'll take an extra bowl.

1389
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:02,780
Sure.

1390
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:12,120
You look like you're gonna pass out.
Have you eaten anything today?

1391
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:13,380
Eat.

1392
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:18,630
This is a nightmare.

1393
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:22,550
So why?

1394
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:26,110
- Why?
- Why?

1395
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:30,630
Hey. This is everything.

1396
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:33,450
There's gotta be a bigger reason why,
and you know it.

1397
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:35,940
Well, how about it had to do more
with you guys than with me?

1398
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:39,230
Yeah.

1399
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:42,110
Yeah, it's the only thing
that makes sense.

1400
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:48,840
Did he tell you anything?

1401
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:50,600
Only that I wasn't getting a cent.

1402
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:53,010
That's because he wanted you
to build something from the ground up...

1403
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:54,630
"Build something from the ground up."

1404
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:56,560
My mother built her business
from the ground up

1405
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:58,630
with a million-dollar loan
from my grandfather.

1406
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:01,510
My father owns none of it.
She made him sign a prenup.

1407
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:03,360
He lives in fear.

1408
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:06,950
I know that's what my grandfather was
trying to protect me from by doing this

1409
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:09,990
and I know I shouldn't say this out loud,
but when he told me, I...

1410
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:13,190
Jesus.

1411
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:14,990
I coulda killed him.

1412
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:20,470
After I left the party though,
I was driving.

1413
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:23,350
Nowhere, just in the night,
and I had this...

1414
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:26,990
clarity.

1415
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,750
Like, from here on out,
I was gonna have to fend for myself.

1416
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:32,560
And that felt...

1417
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:35,640
good.

1418
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:38,430
The old bastard.

1419
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:44,600
Marta, I know three things.

1420
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:47,320
One, I know he didn't commit suicide.

1421
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:51,990
- What makes you think that?
- I don't think it.

1422
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:53,550
I know it.

1423
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:55,550
Because I knew my granddad.

1424
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:57,550
Maybe you and I were
the only two who knew him,

1425
01:14:57,680 --> 01:14:59,910
so you're not gonna bullshit me
on this because, two...

1426
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:02,870
I know lying makes you puke.

1427
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:06,150
'Cause of that mafia game
last Fourth of JJuly.

1428
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:08,550
And three...

1429
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:13,310
I know you just ate
a full plate of baked beans and sausage.

1430
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:17,240
So...

1431
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:20,760
Look me in the eye

1432
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:24,310
and tell me what happened
to my grandfather.

1433
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:29,390
- You asshole.
- Marta.

1434
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:32,150
Tell me everything.

1435
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:37,950
Alan, there have got to be options here.

1436
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:39,070
No.

1437
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:40,710
I don't know how many times

1438
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:43,630
I can repeat the same
two pieces of information.

1439
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:46,990
If Harlan was of sound mind
when he made the changes,

1440
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:50,230
- and we all confirmed that he was...
- Would a sound mind do this?

1441
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:51,540
How... Sound, how?

1442
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:54,030
The very action speaks to unsoundness.

1443
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:55,440
Not legally. No.

1444
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:59,900
You not liking what he did
does not speak to testamentary capacity.

1445
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,430
What about undue influence?

1446
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:04,980
Yeah! Undue influence.
How about that? Huh?

1447
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:06,390
Did you just Google that?

1448
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:09,670
Look, if Marta was manipulating Dad
somehow and if we found out...

1449
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:11,670
If somehow, she had gotten
her hooks into him...

1450
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:14,220
You need a strong case for that.

1451
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:17,230
"Your Honor, she endeared herself to him

1452
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:19,710
through hard work and good humor."

1453
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:21,510
That won't cut the salami.

1454
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:23,510
What about the slayer rule?

1455
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:25,520
I did just Google that.

1456
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:27,840
The slayer rule obviously
doesn't apply here.

1457
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:30,480
Well, what the hell is the slayer rule?

1458
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:33,110
Well, it's if someone is convicted
of killing the person,

1459
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:34,550
they don't get their inheritance.

1460
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:35,640
Not even convicted.

1461
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:38,240
Even if they're held responsible
for their death in civil court.

1462
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:39,990
Like O.J.?

1463
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:42,510
Yes, like O.J.

1464
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:45,990
But Harlan committed suicide.

1465
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,670
Detective Blanc?

1466
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:59,790
You said the investigation is ongoing.
You made a point of that.

1467
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:01,510
Do you suspect foul play?

1468
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:05,190
Mr. Blanc, if you please...

1469
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:09,590
There is much that remains unclear,
but yes,

1470
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:13,270
I suspect foul play.

1471
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:15,720
Marta?

1472
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:18,630
I have eliminated no suspects.

1473
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:21,620
You're full of shit.

1474
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:23,390
I don't trust this guy in the tweed suit.

1475
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:26,310
And, Alan, God bless you, you're useless.

1476
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:27,400
Thank you.

1477
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:31,070
There's only one answer to this.
She has to renounce the inheritance.

1478
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:33,720
- She knows it's what she should do.
- That's exactly what she...

1479
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:34,980
Right? No way.

1480
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:36,510
It's the moral thing.

1481
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:38,150
- Mom.
- She'll do it.

1482
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:40,990
If Granddad wanted to give Marta
everything, that's what he wanted.

1483
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:42,270
No.

1484
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:44,510
This wasn't him. He loved us.

1485
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:46,030
He wanted us taken care of.

1486
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:48,070
He wanted you to have an education.

1487
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:49,550
Meg,

1488
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:52,350
you think I can pay for your school?

1489
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:04,070
I know.

1490
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:06,390
Just saying it, it sounds insane,
but it's all true.

1491
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:09,400
And I think Blanc's been on to me
from the start.

1492
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:11,710
I don't care if I go to jail, but my mom,

1493
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:13,590
my sister?

1494
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:15,040
We...

1495
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:18,750
You gonna say something?

1496
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:23,310
I always thought I was the only one
that could beat him at Go.

1497
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:26,150
Always thought that meant something.

1498
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:28,760
Yeah, I know you did.

1499
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:30,030
That night at the party,

1500
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:32,590
my last conversation with him...

1501
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:35,110
My last argument,
that's what he told me about you.

1502
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:38,790
That you beat him at Go
more than I do, and I thought...

1503
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:43,350
"What a strange thing to tell me."

1504
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:46,980
Think I get it now.

1505
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:51,150
Maybe it did mean something.

1506
01:18:56,840 --> 01:18:58,710
I'm not gonna tell my family shit.

1507
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:00,070
You're not gonna go to jail.

1508
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:02,030
That detective is not gonna catch you.

1509
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:04,480
And you're not gonna give up the money.

1510
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:06,960
This is what Granddad wanted for you.

1511
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,770
Think about what he did
to go through with this.

1512
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:11,230
He wanted this for himself,
he wanted this for the family.

1513
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:13,630
And he wanted it for you.

1514
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:15,230
You've come this far.

1515
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:18,110
Let me help you go all the way.

1516
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:20,030
What's going on? This isn't you.

1517
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:23,790
You could just turn me in right now
and still get your cut of the inheritance.

1518
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:24,910
Why?

1519
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:27,000
Because fuck my family.

1520
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:30,590
I can help you get away with this.

1521
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:31,870
And then,

1522
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:34,670
you're gonna give me
my cut of the inheritance.

1523
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:38,200
Happy ending. Everybody wins.

1524
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:40,470
You, me, Harlan.

1525
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:41,670
Yeah.

1526
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:44,230
Deal?

1527
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:58,310
- Meg.
<i>- Marta...</i>

1528
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:00,950
<i>That was nuts.</i>

1529
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:02,110
I know.

1530
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:03,390
<i>Are you okay?</i>

1531
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:07,030
Yeah. Are you?

1532
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:08,750
<i>Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine, I...</i>

1533
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:12,350
<i>Look, no one knows
I'm calling you, I just...</i>

1534
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:13,660
<i>I wanted to...</i>

1535
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:19,110
<i>I wanted to say sorry
for how everyone was.</i>

1536
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:21,320
<i>And...</i>

1537
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:25,670
I guess, I wanted to ask,
what are you gonna do?

1538
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,120
What do you mean?

1539
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:31,310
<i>Well, the...</i>

1540
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:33,470
<i>You know, with the will,
what are you gonna do?</i>

1541
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:38,270
What do you think I should do?

1542
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:43,950
<i>You should do whatever you think is right.</i>

1543
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:47,670
Look, I...

1544
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:51,470
I think you should give it back to us.

1545
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:56,070
<i>Granddad always took care of us.</i>

1546
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:57,670
<i>You know, we're his family.</i>

1547
01:20:57,760 --> 01:21:01,470
<i>And I know he was like family to you,
but we're his actual family.</i>

1548
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:02,560
Yeah.

1549
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:04,470
And look, Marta,

1550
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:06,430
you know this isn't fair.

1551
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:08,600
We've always been good to you

1552
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:11,630
<i>and you're like family,
and we'll take care of you,</i>

1553
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:13,710
<i>but you have to make things right.</i>

1554
01:21:14,440 --> 01:21:15,440
<i>You know what's right.</i>

1555
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:17,950
<i>Marta...</i>

1556
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:21,950
Mom's broke.

1557
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:24,720
<i>And she says I'm gonna have
to drop out of school.</i>

1558
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:26,350
No. No, no, Meg.

1559
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:29,550
Listen, I won't let that happen.

1560
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:32,110
<i>Whatever money you need,
I'll give it to you.</i>

1561
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:35,230
<i>I'm here for you. And I want you to know
I'm gonna take care of you,</i>

1562
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:36,590
<i>I promise that.</i>

1563
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:37,680
<i>Okay?</i>

1564
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:39,240
Thanks.

1565
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:40,350
<i>And once I...</i>

1566
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:48,910
<i>Sometimes I think it's a sin</i>

1567
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:53,550
<i>When I feel like I'm winnin'
When I'm losin' again</i>

1568
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:01,030
Okay then.

1569
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:04,750
Did Blanc find anything suspicious
at the house?

1570
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:09,590
Yes, he found mud upstairs.

1571
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:12,190
- Where I broke in through the window.
- Shit.

1572
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:13,320
Identifiable prints?

1573
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,430
- No.
- Good. Okay.

1574
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:18,400
Good. Hey...

1575
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:22,310
You lay low for a couple days,
wait for this investigation to blow over,

1576
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:23,670
and it will.

1577
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:26,950
'Cause no matter how good this Blanc guy
thinks he is, he's got nothin'.

1578
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:29,710
Hey, relax.

1579
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:32,950
Marta, get your ass up!

1580
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:35,570
What the hell is happening?
There's a guy here and a bunch of stuff.

1581
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:37,150
Everything's going crazy. Are we rich?

1582
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:40,870
Maybe, Alice. I don't know.

1583
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:43,600
I don't know what that means,
but you better get your ass up, okay?

1584
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,830
<i>We don't know much about Marta Cabrera,</i>

1585
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:48,610
<i>- or her exact relationship...</i>
- Oh, my God.

1586
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:50,070
Marta, what is all this?

1587
01:22:50,160 --> 01:22:51,670
What did you do?

1588
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:54,590
- Is that here?
- Oh, yeah, it is.

1589
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:57,110
Wait, so is that true?

1590
01:22:57,680 --> 01:22:59,000
Are we rich?

1591
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:01,510
<i>This is a story so compelling...</i>

1592
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:02,600
Oh, my God.

1593
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:04,590
<i>...it is as if he had written
the story himself.</i>

1594
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:19,350
Good morning, Mrs. Thrombey.

1595
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:27,790
Why is grief the providence of youth?

1596
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:30,230
I don't know.

1597
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:37,030
But I'd imagine
that age deepens all feelings.

1598
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:40,080
Including grief.

1599
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:47,470
This was a long walk
to offering condolences

1600
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:49,950
for the loss of your son.

1601
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:53,860
And asking you,
if it isn't presumptuous of me,

1602
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:57,190
not to think too harshly of your family...

1603
01:23:58,280 --> 01:24:03,300
if I am, as I suspect,
the first to console you.

1604
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:06,940
They're young, aren't they?

1605
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:15,430
One thing I assume of age

1606
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,270
is weariness.

1607
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:21,030
Damned if I don't get
more tired every day.

1608
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:23,310
Tired of what I do.

1609
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:26,790
Following arcs like lobbed rocks,

1610
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:29,070
the inevitability of truth.

1611
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:34,150
But the complexity and the gray...

1612
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:36,990
lie not in the truth...

1613
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:41,670
but what you do with the truth
once you have it.

1614
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:52,110
I think you have something
you wanna tell me.

1615
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:56,750
I think you're very perceptive

1616
01:24:56,840 --> 01:24:59,750
and very capable
of telling me what you saw

1617
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:02,110
the night of your son's party.

1618
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:12,150
But I'll happily wait.

1619
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:14,390
I'm in no rush.

1620
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:16,910
In fact,

1621
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:20,630
I find it quite pleasant
sitting here with you.

1622
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:30,100
Lawyers were here.

1623
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:31,630
Very big lawyers, it looked like.

1624
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:33,910
They left this stuff and business cards.

1625
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,460
And there was a pile of other stuff
when I got home.

1626
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:38,870
I don't like any of this, Marta.

1627
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,870
I don't like it either.
I'm slipping out the back.

1628
01:25:43,480 --> 01:25:45,870
I'll be back later.
Please don't talk to anyone.

1629
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:53,560
Walt?

1630
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:57,030
Yeah, I came...

1631
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:58,270
Hey, how you doin'?

1632
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:03,910
Walt, I want you to know
that I didn't know about any of this.

1633
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,250
- We know you didn't.
- This is...

1634
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:06,500
We know you didn't.

1635
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:09,950
Yeah, we all kind of went
a little crazy yesterday.

1636
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:11,590
- Understandable.
- Yeah.

1637
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:15,110
I haven't even looked at all this yet.

1638
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:17,840
It must just be
local lawyers and accountants

1639
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:20,350
who saw the news
and wanna get a jump on it.

1640
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:22,590
Yeah. I'd be careful of all of it.

1641
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:28,990
Marta, is it your intention
to renounce the inheritance?

1642
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:34,590
This is what Harlan wanted.

1643
01:26:36,640 --> 01:26:37,790
Yeah, but...

1644
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:40,710
Harlan put you in
a very hard position here.

1645
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:42,990
I mean... it was unfair of him.

1646
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:45,310
I mean, you see

1647
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:48,670
the kind of press and scrutiny
that this kicks up.

1648
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:51,590
And we know, with your mother...

1649
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,000
My mother?

1650
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:55,080
Yeah.

1651
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:02,150
What did Meg tell you?

1652
01:27:03,080 --> 01:27:04,590
This isn't about...

1653
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:07,790
You're missing the point.

1654
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:09,830
We don't wanna attack you with this,

1655
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:13,830
but, Marta, if your mother
came into the country illegally,

1656
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:15,110
criminally,

1657
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:16,950
and you've come into this inheritance,

1658
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:19,030
with all the scrutiny that entails,

1659
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:20,710
I'd be afraid that could come to light.

1660
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:23,310
And that's what we wanna avoid here.

1661
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:24,590
We can protect you...

1662
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:28,390
from that happening, or if it happens.

1663
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:32,760
So you're saying that
even if it came to light,

1664
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:35,910
with your family's resources,
you could help me fix it?

1665
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,320
Yeah.

1666
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:39,510
Yeah, with the right lawyers, you know?

1667
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:40,820
Not these local guys,

1668
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:43,560
but New York lawyers, DC lawyers,

1669
01:27:43,640 --> 01:27:45,870
with enough resources put toward it, yes.

1670
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:49,310
Not that that ever even needs
to come up, but...

1671
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:50,800
yes.

1672
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:53,590
Okay, good.

1673
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:56,520
Okay?

1674
01:27:57,720 --> 01:28:00,990
'Cause Harlan gave me all your resources.

1675
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:04,670
So that means with my resources,
I'll be able to fix it.

1676
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:06,510
So I guess I will find the right lawyers.

1677
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:08,110
Uh, Marta, that's...

1678
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:12,470
You better be sure that's...

1679
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:15,390
what you want.

1680
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:33,780
No...

1681
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:56,040
- I don't know... What's this?
- It's my medical bag tag.

1682
01:28:56,680 --> 01:28:58,710
They have my medical bag for some reason.

1683
01:28:59,360 --> 01:29:01,630
Okay, but this is a photocopy
of just the header

1684
01:29:01,720 --> 01:29:04,590
of a blood toxicology report on Harlan.

1685
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:06,790
Marta, this is gonna show
the morphine overdose.

1686
01:29:10,160 --> 01:29:11,160
So I'm screwed?

1687
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:14,950
How do you know all this stuff?

1688
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:17,190
I was Harlan's research assistant
for a summer.

1689
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:20,390
But what kind of blackmail scheme is this?

1690
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:23,910
I mean, the actual evidence is sitting
up the street, at the crime lab.

1691
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,190
There's no demands,
there's no meeting place.

1692
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:30,190
What's the point in sending you this?

1693
01:29:40,680 --> 01:29:43,240
It could be a half hour.
It could be an hour. It depends.

1694
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:44,540
We wanna make sure...

1695
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:54,590
- So, it could take a while.
- What's the cheese?

1696
01:29:54,680 --> 01:29:56,000
- Oh, hey.
- Yeah.

1697
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:57,590
- Thank you, Chief.
- No problem.

1698
01:29:57,680 --> 01:29:58,750
5:00 a.m.

1699
01:29:58,840 --> 01:30:00,790
Security systems here are all triggered.

1700
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:02,670
Now, this thing went up really quick,

1701
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:06,800
so that means blood stores, records,
anything of that nature, it's all gone.

1702
01:30:06,920 --> 01:30:09,380
There were no employees here,
so, thank God for that.

1703
01:30:10,720 --> 01:30:12,510
What about security cameras?

1704
01:30:13,080 --> 01:30:14,150
Oh, yeah.

1705
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:17,960
Speaking of security,

1706
01:30:18,040 --> 01:30:19,910
the surveillance tape
at the Thrombey estate

1707
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,190
was all scrambled for some reason.

1708
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:23,350
Yeah.

1709
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:26,470
What's still pending from the autopsy?

1710
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:28,510
Just a report on the blood work.

1711
01:30:30,200 --> 01:30:31,420
Blood work?

1712
01:30:36,360 --> 01:30:37,710
Holy shit.

1713
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:42,680
This is insane.

1714
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:46,710
I mean, who would blow up
a whole real building

1715
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:48,200
just to blackmail me?

1716
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:50,520
Marta, this means the blackmailer
has the only paper copy

1717
01:30:50,600 --> 01:30:52,230
of the thing that can prove your guilt.

1718
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:55,430
You didn't get any other instructions?
No phone call? No e-mail? Nothing?

1719
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:56,550
No.

1720
01:30:57,480 --> 01:30:59,390
Well, I haven't checked my e-mail.

1721
01:31:04,680 --> 01:31:05,680
There is one.

1722
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:09,750
Yeah, that's it.
"1209 Columbus Road. 10 a.m."

1723
01:31:16,040 --> 01:31:18,320
You know what this means, right?
If you destroy that copy,

1724
01:31:18,920 --> 01:31:20,320
you're totally in the clear.

1725
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:22,440
Oh, no.

1726
01:31:23,720 --> 01:31:25,230
Marta, did you hear me?

1727
01:31:27,720 --> 01:31:28,750
Yeah.

1728
01:31:36,920 --> 01:31:38,070
Elliott!

1729
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:39,190
We gotta go! We gotta go!

1730
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:44,430
- Okay, Baby Driver.
- Oh, God.

1731
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:47,200
- You regret helping me yet?
- I regret not taking the Beemer.

1732
01:31:49,640 --> 01:31:51,230
Oh, shit.

1733
01:32:04,840 --> 01:32:06,970
- Vehicles in pursuit on Washington Street.
- No force.

1734
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:08,410
- Make sure you say "no force."
- No force.

1735
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:10,920
- We got a possible murder suspect.
- I said that. I said that.

1736
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:14,670
Go. Go! Go! Are you flooring it?

1737
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:16,310
I am literally flooring it!

1738
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:29,250
- This is going well.
- I'm pulling over. I'm...

1739
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:31,790
If you miss your chance
to get this tox report, it's all over.

1740
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:33,710
Oh, my God.

1741
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:38,510
Whoa!

1742
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:39,950
Why... Why are we stopping?

1743
01:32:40,040 --> 01:32:41,990
Why are you stopping
in the middle of the road?

1744
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:56,230
Hold on.

1745
01:33:20,640 --> 01:33:22,830
Oh, my God,
I'm just pure adrenaline right now.

1746
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:24,710
I feel like I swallowed bees.

1747
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:25,800
Okay.

1748
01:33:25,880 --> 01:33:27,310
So where is it? What's the address?

1749
01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:28,830
1209 Columbus Road.

1750
01:33:28,920 --> 01:33:30,710
Okay. I mean, whatever they want,

1751
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:31,920
- I'll say yes...
- Anything.

1752
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:33,560
You know, just to get that report back.

1753
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:35,430
- Get it back and destroy it.
- Destroy it.

1754
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:37,230
Holy shit, Ransom.

1755
01:33:38,120 --> 01:33:39,550
Hey, thank you.

1756
01:33:40,520 --> 01:33:42,030
I couldn't do this without you.

1757
01:33:46,240 --> 01:33:47,270
Oh, my God.

1758
01:33:48,240 --> 01:33:49,270
Get out.

1759
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:54,160
That was the dumbest car chase
of all time.

1760
01:33:54,720 --> 01:33:56,040
Put your hands down.

1761
01:33:56,120 --> 01:33:58,840
I spoke to Wanetta Thrombey, Greatnana.

1762
01:33:58,920 --> 01:34:02,070
Night of the party, she saw someone
climbing the trellis to the third floor.

1763
01:34:03,160 --> 01:34:05,270
- Mr. Drysdale, come on.
- Let's go.

1764
01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:08,880
- Pat him down, check him out.
- What's going on?

1765
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:12,430
- "Ransom came back," she said.
- Hands on the vehicle.

1766
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:14,830
I don't know what he came back to do,
but we'll find out.

1767
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:16,150
You got anything sharp?

1768
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:20,190
- Watch your head. Thank you.
- Hey, you don't need to thank him.

1769
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:23,510
Did he ask you to drive
when he saw me coming?

1770
01:34:25,080 --> 01:34:26,150
Yes.

1771
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:35,190
Blanc, coming with us?

1772
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:36,710
I'll drive with Marta.

1773
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:39,150
Let's go to the police station.

1774
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:42,670
I want a full rundown
on everything he said to you.

1775
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:44,350
I'll catch you up on where we're at.

1776
01:34:51,480 --> 01:34:54,150
Strange case from the start.

1777
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:58,390
A case with a hole in the middle.

1778
01:35:00,280 --> 01:35:01,280
A doughnut.

1779
01:35:02,680 --> 01:35:05,110
I'm just talking through my process here.

1780
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:06,990
Let me know if this is boring.

1781
01:35:07,720 --> 01:35:09,350
I feel the noose tightening.

1782
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:12,310
The family is truly desperate.

1783
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:14,670
Desperate motives.

1784
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:17,470
The mystery of who hired me.

1785
01:35:17,560 --> 01:35:19,190
The impossibility of the crime.

1786
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:21,590
And yet...

1787
01:35:22,760 --> 01:35:24,510
A doughnut.

1788
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:27,110
One central piece.

1789
01:35:27,240 --> 01:35:30,310
And if it reveals itself,
the fog would lift,

1790
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:34,510
the arc would resolve,
the Slinky become unkinked.

1791
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:36,550
Do you mind if I stop for a second?

1792
01:35:36,640 --> 01:35:38,150
I need to pick something up.

1793
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:39,670
It'll be very quick.

1794
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:42,070
Sure.

1795
01:35:55,640 --> 01:35:56,960
It'll be just a few minutes.

1796
01:35:57,040 --> 01:35:58,230
Watch the...

1797
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,000
door.

1798
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:23,480
Hello?

1799
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:49,350
Listen, I don't know what you want.

1800
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:53,990
Whatever it is, we can work it out.

1801
01:36:54,120 --> 01:36:56,680
But we have to figure it out
right here, right now.

1802
01:36:56,760 --> 01:36:58,430
And I'm leaving with that report.

1803
01:37:03,160 --> 01:37:04,270
Hello?

1804
01:37:29,560 --> 01:37:30,750
Fran?

1805
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:42,310
No, no, no, no! Fran?

1806
01:37:43,960 --> 01:37:45,180
Oh, my God, Fran.

1807
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:46,310
Can you hear me?

1808
01:37:47,080 --> 01:37:49,230
Fran, give me a sign if you can hear me.

1809
01:37:49,320 --> 01:37:51,470
- You...
- Yes, it's me. It's Marta.

1810
01:37:51,560 --> 01:37:53,430
You called me here, you sent me an e-mail.

1811
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:55,630
That's why I'm here.
Did you take something?

1812
01:37:55,720 --> 01:37:58,070
I'm gonna call an ambulance now.
You're gonna be okay.

1813
01:37:58,160 --> 01:37:59,870
You're gonna be fine, okay? Stay with me.

1814
01:37:59,960 --> 01:38:01,180
- Copy...
- What?

1815
01:38:01,280 --> 01:38:02,310
Copy...

1816
01:38:03,160 --> 01:38:04,270
Stashed...

1817
01:38:04,360 --> 01:38:05,710
What? What are you saying?

1818
01:38:07,080 --> 01:38:08,630
You did this.

1819
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:11,390
Won't get away with this.

1820
01:38:11,480 --> 01:38:12,670
Jesus, stop it!

1821
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:36,830
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

1822
01:38:38,240 --> 01:38:42,990
<i>The thought of you stays bright</i>

1823
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:49,190
<i>Sometimes I stand
In the middle of the floor</i>

1824
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:54,580
<i>Not going left</i>

1825
01:38:55,880 --> 01:38:56,910
<i>Not going...</i>

1826
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:58,220
Oh, Lord.

1827
01:39:00,440 --> 01:39:02,950
All right, my friend.
Thank you for the update.

1828
01:39:04,160 --> 01:39:05,190
There's no need for that.

1829
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:08,630
I'll bring her in once we get word
that the housekeeper is stable.

1830
01:39:08,720 --> 01:39:10,040
It's still touch and go.

1831
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:11,600
All right.

1832
01:39:13,120 --> 01:39:14,190
Listen, this is over.

1833
01:39:14,280 --> 01:39:15,790
People are getting hurt.

1834
01:39:18,440 --> 01:39:19,760
So I'm gonna tell you the truth.

1835
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:23,390
Young Ransom just told
Lieutenant Elliott everything.

1836
01:39:24,040 --> 01:39:25,040
Good.

1837
01:39:25,120 --> 01:39:27,110
Wait, I hope he didn't cover for me.

1838
01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:28,680
Did he tell you the real truth

1839
01:39:28,760 --> 01:39:30,750
- about me switching the...
- Yeah.

1840
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:32,110
- And the disguise bit?
- Yes.

1841
01:39:32,200 --> 01:39:34,190
And the whole blackmail and...

1842
01:39:35,200 --> 01:39:37,430
But why did Fran take my morphine?

1843
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:39,830
I mean, obviously she had swiped
the bag from the house,

1844
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:41,870
but she didn't seem like a user to me,

1845
01:39:41,960 --> 01:39:43,950
unless that's why she needed
the blackmail money.

1846
01:39:44,080 --> 01:39:46,350
I don't know. It doesn't matter anyway.

1847
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:49,120
I have to tell the Thrombeys myself.
I feel like I owe that to them.

1848
01:39:49,200 --> 01:39:50,550
I don't think that's a good idea.

1849
01:39:50,640 --> 01:39:52,990
No, I have to do it. I need to do it.

1850
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:56,400
I gave the doctors my number,

1851
01:39:56,480 --> 01:39:58,280
so they'll call if anything
changes with Fran.

1852
01:39:58,360 --> 01:39:59,360
All right.

1853
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:02,670
I'll round up the Thrombeys at the house,
along with a police escort.

1854
01:40:03,240 --> 01:40:04,720
For the arrest after.

1855
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:07,840
You can tell me your whole story
on the drive over.

1856
01:40:09,200 --> 01:40:11,070
I don't want any more surprises.

1857
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:30,470
Fran said it was stashed,
the copy, and then she said,

1858
01:40:31,080 --> 01:40:33,270
"You did this.
You won't get away with it."

1859
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:36,030
And I called the ambulance.

1860
01:40:36,680 --> 01:40:37,790
That's it.

1861
01:40:39,080 --> 01:40:40,110
All right.

1862
01:40:42,280 --> 01:40:43,390
You ready?

1863
01:40:50,640 --> 01:40:51,830
Okay.

1864
01:40:52,400 --> 01:40:54,030
Well, has she come to her senses?

1865
01:40:54,120 --> 01:40:56,770
Well, she's standing right there, Richard.
She can speak for herself.

1866
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:58,960
- Is the rest of the family here?
- In the living room.

1867
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:02,390
I think that it would be better if we were
to gather again and get this over with.

1868
01:41:08,040 --> 01:41:09,440
- Hey.
- Hey.

1869
01:41:11,720 --> 01:41:13,590
I'm so sorry I told them about your mom.

1870
01:41:13,680 --> 01:41:15,350
Meg, it's okay.

1871
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:18,840
I'm sorry. No... I was scared.
I just... I didn't wanna tell them.

1872
01:41:18,920 --> 01:41:20,430
I get it.

1873
01:41:20,520 --> 01:41:21,790
Trust me.

1874
01:41:22,520 --> 01:41:24,550
I understand. It's all right.

1875
01:41:25,720 --> 01:41:26,720
I'm sorry.

1876
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,720
God, I am so raiding
Fran's stash after this.

1877
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:35,260
I still think this is a bad idea,

1878
01:41:35,960 --> 01:41:38,070
but the family is assembled.

1879
01:41:41,480 --> 01:41:43,230
I know where the tox report is.

1880
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:52,470
She basically told me where it was.

1881
01:41:55,120 --> 01:41:56,950
Anyways, this will tie everything up.

1882
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:00,910
And I just handed it to you.

1883
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:04,790
God, you're not much
of a detective, are you?

1884
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:06,990
Well, to be fair...

1885
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:11,230
you make a pretty lousy murderer.

1886
01:42:13,280 --> 01:42:14,950
Perhaps we deserve each other.

1887
01:42:27,240 --> 01:42:28,790
You've always been good to me.

1888
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:32,910
And what I'm about to say
isn't gonna be easy

1889
01:42:33,040 --> 01:42:34,520
and you're gonna be upset.

1890
01:42:35,480 --> 01:42:38,270
But I thought after what you've
gone through the last few days,

1891
01:42:39,560 --> 01:42:41,870
that you deserved to hear it from me.

1892
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:46,180
- I...
- Excuse me!

1893
01:42:50,680 --> 01:42:52,950
You have not been good to her.

1894
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:55,830
You have all treated her like shit,

1895
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:59,430
to steal back a fortune that you lost
and she deserves.

1896
01:43:00,160 --> 01:43:03,070
You're a pack of vultures at the feast!

1897
01:43:03,160 --> 01:43:04,950
Knives out, beaks bloody!

1898
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:06,440
Well...

1899
01:43:07,080 --> 01:43:09,670
You're not getting bailed out,
not this time.

1900
01:43:10,720 --> 01:43:14,790
Miss Cabrera has decided, definitively,
not to renounce the inheritance.

1901
01:43:15,320 --> 01:43:17,030
- What?
- What?

1902
01:43:17,120 --> 01:43:20,150
Furthermore, it will be
my professional recommendation

1903
01:43:20,240 --> 01:43:22,350
to the local authorities
that the manner of death

1904
01:43:22,440 --> 01:43:26,550
in the case of Harlan Thrombey
is ruled as suicide!

1905
01:43:26,640 --> 01:43:28,120
- And the case is closed.
- Blanc?

1906
01:43:28,200 --> 01:43:30,990
- What?
- Thank you all for coming. Goodbye.

1907
01:43:31,080 --> 01:43:32,480
What's going on? Just tell me...

1908
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:37,200
That's certainly not what I was expecting.

1909
01:43:37,280 --> 01:43:39,550
- No.
- Is anybody else confused?

1910
01:43:39,640 --> 01:43:41,670
Not what I was expecting to hear at all.

1911
01:43:44,360 --> 01:43:46,050
Are you gonna tell me
what the hell is going on?

1912
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:48,910
- Yes. Yes.
- I just wanna come clean, okay?

1913
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:50,320
- It's over.
- Almost.

1914
01:43:50,400 --> 01:43:51,670
Blanc, what are we doing?

1915
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:54,150
- What's going on?
- I'm sorry. Officer Wagner.

1916
01:43:54,240 --> 01:43:57,310
Keep the family out of this room,
and get 'em out of the house if you can.

1917
01:43:57,400 --> 01:43:59,470
But stand by with your additional officer.

1918
01:43:59,560 --> 01:44:00,590
Get the family out?

1919
01:44:00,680 --> 01:44:02,390
Yes, but not all of them. Would you...

1920
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:03,480
Thank you.

1921
01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:04,710
- Blanc.
- Yes, sir.

1922
01:44:04,840 --> 01:44:06,270
Come on, what's all this drama?

1923
01:44:06,360 --> 01:44:08,030
- Indulge me.
- Blanc,

1924
01:44:08,120 --> 01:44:11,630
I told Ransom, Ransom told you,
and I'm telling you now,

1925
01:44:11,720 --> 01:44:14,550
it is an immovable fact
that I killed Harlan.

1926
01:44:14,640 --> 01:44:17,150
Yes, you did. Yes, he did. Yes, you are.

1927
01:44:17,240 --> 01:44:20,430
But... But, I spoke in the car
about the hole

1928
01:44:20,520 --> 01:44:22,070
at the center of this doughnut.

1929
01:44:22,680 --> 01:44:25,240
And what you and Harlan did
that fateful night

1930
01:44:25,360 --> 01:44:28,510
seems at first glance
to fill that hole perfectly.

1931
01:44:28,600 --> 01:44:31,350
A doughnut hole in a doughnut's hole.

1932
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:34,190
But we must look a little closer.

1933
01:44:34,600 --> 01:44:37,190
And when we do, we see the doughnut hole

1934
01:44:37,640 --> 01:44:39,430
has a hole in its center.

1935
01:44:39,880 --> 01:44:42,030
It is not a doughnut hole,

1936
01:44:42,120 --> 01:44:44,990
but a smaller doughnut with its own hole

1937
01:44:45,080 --> 01:44:47,870
and our doughnut is not whole at all!

1938
01:44:47,960 --> 01:44:50,130
Blanc, look, I understand
that this is amusing for you...

1939
01:44:50,160 --> 01:44:52,390
Why was I hired?

1940
01:44:53,240 --> 01:44:54,830
Why would someone hire me?

1941
01:44:54,920 --> 01:44:57,670
Someone fishing for a crime
to reverse the will. Come on.

1942
01:44:57,760 --> 01:45:00,070
But I was hired
before the sealed will was read.

1943
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:04,510
So, yes, the person must have known
the contents of the will.

1944
01:45:04,600 --> 01:45:06,000
But one step further.

1945
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:08,990
That same person must have known
a crime was committed,

1946
01:45:09,080 --> 01:45:10,560
and further...

1947
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:15,270
If the intent was to reverse
Marta's inheritance,

1948
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,750
they must have known
that Marta was responsible.

1949
01:45:19,160 --> 01:45:21,510
An intriguing combination of factors.

1950
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:24,870
Someone who knew what Marta did
wanted to expose it

1951
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:26,910
but could not reveal how they knew.

1952
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:28,270
Fran!

1953
01:45:28,360 --> 01:45:31,110
She was blackmailing me.
She knew what I did.

1954
01:45:31,200 --> 01:45:34,870
Yeah, but Fran wanted money,
ergo she did not want the crime exposed.

1955
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,890
What if someone in the family had observed
Marta doing something suspicious?

1956
01:45:37,920 --> 01:45:40,990
But they would have had
no reason not to speak up.

1957
01:45:42,760 --> 01:45:46,350
The answer is not so simple.

1958
01:45:46,920 --> 01:45:51,230
Now with the entire solution
in my field of view,

1959
01:45:51,320 --> 01:45:54,310
the arc of this case
is a tragedy of errors.

1960
01:45:56,680 --> 01:45:58,990
Marta, it will not be easy
for you to hear.

1961
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:02,190
But there is at least

1962
01:46:02,680 --> 01:46:05,240
one truly guilty party behind it all,

1963
01:46:05,320 --> 01:46:08,430
guilty in the true sense
of acting with malice

1964
01:46:09,160 --> 01:46:12,110
and committing a heinous crime
with selfish intent.

1965
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:16,100
Trooper Wagner.

1966
01:46:16,200 --> 01:46:17,710
Trooper Wagner?

1967
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:19,880
No.

1968
01:46:22,240 --> 01:46:24,350
Marta, I'm so sorry.
I told them everything.

1969
01:46:24,480 --> 01:46:25,910
I figured it was up. I'm sorry.

1970
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,390
Hey. It's all right, Ransom,
I'm glad you did.

1971
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:30,550
Not exactly everything though.

1972
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:32,910
Is this about what Greatnana told you?

1973
01:46:33,360 --> 01:46:36,150
She saw me that night.
She mistook me for Ransom.

1974
01:46:36,240 --> 01:46:37,240
We'll get to that.

1975
01:46:37,320 --> 01:46:38,720
In the meanwhile,

1976
01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:41,590
Mr. Hugh Ransom Drysdale,

1977
01:46:42,200 --> 01:46:45,910
you might tell us all why you hired me.

1978
01:46:49,320 --> 01:46:50,590
Why I hired you?

1979
01:46:51,400 --> 01:46:54,830
You're right. Let's back it up
to the night of the party.

1980
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:57,150
<i>Your argument with Harlan.</i>

1981
01:46:57,800 --> 01:46:59,200
What were the overheard words

1982
01:46:59,280 --> 01:47:01,790
by the Nazi child
masturbating in the bathroom?

1983
01:47:02,400 --> 01:47:05,870
<i>"My will," and "I'm warning you."</i>

1984
01:47:05,960 --> 01:47:08,470
You and Harlan were drama mamas.

1985
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:11,430
You shared a love of twisting the knife
into one another.

1986
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:14,550
You see, I don't believe
he would have slipped it in halfway.

1987
01:47:14,640 --> 01:47:15,640
No, no, no.

1988
01:47:16,520 --> 01:47:17,590
I submit

1989
01:47:18,280 --> 01:47:20,740
Harlan told you everything.

1990
01:47:20,840 --> 01:47:22,110
You can't be serious!

1991
01:47:22,200 --> 01:47:28,110
Not a red dime or word of my work
to a single one of them, you included.

1992
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:29,590
Marta,

1993
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:33,510
remind me what Ransom said
his conversation with Harlan ended with?

1994
01:47:34,640 --> 01:47:36,990
Harlan told him that
I could beat him at Go.

1995
01:47:37,080 --> 01:47:40,150
And I asked myself, "Marta?

1996
01:47:40,240 --> 01:47:44,750
Why would the topic of the will
have steered around to Marta?"

1997
01:47:46,120 --> 01:47:49,110
There is one obvious explanation.

1998
01:47:49,200 --> 01:47:52,070
You can't be that crazy. You're not
just gonna throw away your fortune.

1999
01:47:52,160 --> 01:47:54,110
No. I'm giving it to Marta.

2000
01:47:54,200 --> 01:47:55,600
All of it.

2001
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:57,910
Your Brazilian nurse?

2002
01:47:58,000 --> 01:47:59,430
Are you goddamn insane?

2003
01:47:59,520 --> 01:48:02,510
I'm sane for the first time in my life,
and I've done it.

2004
01:48:02,600 --> 01:48:04,230
If you think I'm gonna let this happen,

2005
01:48:04,320 --> 01:48:06,610
- if you think I'll stand here...
- I've made the change to my will.

2006
01:48:06,640 --> 01:48:08,630
- It's done.
- I'm warning you!

2007
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:11,670
That's some heavy-duty conjecture.

2008
01:48:12,320 --> 01:48:13,430
Granted.

2009
01:48:13,880 --> 01:48:16,790
But it is the only way
what comes next makes sense.

2010
01:48:17,720 --> 01:48:20,470
So you storm out,
you drive off into the night.

2011
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:23,070
<i>You tell Marta later...</i>

2012
01:48:23,600 --> 01:48:26,060
What was it?
Feeling an overwhelming sense of...

2013
01:48:26,640 --> 01:48:27,750
Clarity.

2014
01:48:28,280 --> 01:48:31,430
That he had to make do for himself
from here on out.

2015
01:48:31,520 --> 01:48:32,520
Exactly.

2016
01:48:35,800 --> 01:48:38,440
<i>Marta. The will. Harlan.</i>

2017
01:48:38,520 --> 01:48:40,030
<i>"Do for yourself."</i>

2018
01:48:40,120 --> 01:48:41,990
<i>"You won't get away with this."</i>

2019
01:48:42,720 --> 01:48:44,670
<i>And a plan forms.</i>

2020
01:48:53,320 --> 01:48:54,430
<i>You return,</i>

2021
01:48:54,520 --> 01:48:57,310
<i>careful to avoid the gate's
security camera range.</i>

2022
01:48:57,800 --> 01:49:00,150
<i>Then on foot up towards the house,</i>

2023
01:49:00,240 --> 01:49:02,070
<i>you sneak in up the trellis,</i>

2024
01:49:02,160 --> 01:49:04,590
<i>so as not to be seen
by the rest of the family</i>

2025
01:49:04,680 --> 01:49:07,400
<i>who are still having
their party downstairs.</i>

2026
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:12,960
<i>What you need to do will take moments.</i>

2027
01:49:13,040 --> 01:49:16,950
<i>But it is essential
that you are alone and undetected.</i>

2028
01:49:17,560 --> 01:49:19,990
<i>You knew what medications Harlan took.</i>

2029
01:49:20,080 --> 01:49:22,910
<i>You knew what Marta would be
injecting him with that night.</i>

2030
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:24,840
<i>And you knew</i>

2031
01:49:25,960 --> 01:49:29,550
if Marta was responsible for his death,

2032
01:49:29,640 --> 01:49:31,270
<i>even unintentionally,</i>

2033
01:49:32,480 --> 01:49:35,470
the slayer rule would nullify
the changed will

2034
01:49:35,560 --> 01:49:37,670
and you would get your share back.

2035
01:49:38,720 --> 01:49:40,350
<i>You used the syringes in the kit</i>

2036
01:49:40,440 --> 01:49:43,080
<i>to switch the liquids
in the two medication vials.</i>

2037
01:49:43,160 --> 01:49:45,800
And as a final precaution...

2038
01:49:47,880 --> 01:49:50,030
<i>you took the Naloxone,</i>

2039
01:49:50,560 --> 01:49:52,830
the lifesaving antidote.

2040
01:49:53,680 --> 01:49:55,670
<i>No. No, no, no, that's impossible.</i>

2041
01:49:56,080 --> 01:49:57,710
That is the truth.

2042
01:49:57,800 --> 01:50:00,260
Hand me that vial of morphine.
I'll show you.

2043
01:50:00,360 --> 01:50:02,750
If he did that, if the meds were switched,

2044
01:50:03,360 --> 01:50:05,950
then when I got them mixed up, I...

2045
01:50:07,320 --> 01:50:09,550
I accidentally switched them back, so...

2046
01:50:10,840 --> 01:50:12,030
I gave Harlan...

2047
01:50:12,120 --> 01:50:13,270
The correct doses.

2048
01:50:14,080 --> 01:50:15,230
Yes.

2049
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:19,160
But not accidentally.

2050
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:23,950
I taped over the label of these two vials.

2051
01:50:25,120 --> 01:50:27,910
The vials themselves are identical.

2052
01:50:30,640 --> 01:50:32,390
How'd you know this was the morphine?

2053
01:50:33,200 --> 01:50:34,630
I just knew.

2054
01:50:34,720 --> 01:50:37,870
You knew because there is the slightest,
almost imperceptible differences

2055
01:50:37,960 --> 01:50:40,230
of tincture and viscosity
between the two liquids.

2056
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:46,030
You knew because
you've done it a hundred times.

2057
01:50:47,240 --> 01:50:49,470
You gave him the correct medication

2058
01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:52,020
because you are a good nurse.

2059
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:54,550
Then Harlan was...

2060
01:50:54,640 --> 01:50:56,550
I'm sorry, Marta. But yes.

2061
01:50:58,120 --> 01:51:00,070
- Harlan was perfectly fine.
- Oh, my God.

2062
01:51:01,240 --> 01:51:02,510
His blood was normal.

2063
01:51:03,560 --> 01:51:07,150
The cause of death was truly,
solely suicide,

2064
01:51:07,680 --> 01:51:10,910
and you are guilty of nothing
but some damage to the trellis

2065
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:12,550
and a few amateur theatrics.

2066
01:51:13,400 --> 01:51:17,550
In fact, if Harlan had listened to you
and called the ambulance...

2067
01:51:19,600 --> 01:51:20,790
he would be alive today.

2068
01:51:24,920 --> 01:51:25,920
Damn!

2069
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:27,430
A twisted web.

2070
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:30,910
And we are not finished untangling it.

2071
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:32,070
Not yet.

2072
01:51:32,840 --> 01:51:36,830
Marta, when Greatnana spotted you
climbing down the trellis, she said...

2073
01:51:38,360 --> 01:51:42,110
Ransom? Are you back again already?

2074
01:51:42,200 --> 01:51:44,990
<i>"Are you back again already?"</i>

2075
01:51:45,080 --> 01:51:46,350
'Cause earlier that night...

2076
01:51:49,560 --> 01:51:51,910
Ransom, you're back?

2077
01:51:54,360 --> 01:51:55,580
Come on, Marta.

2078
01:51:55,680 --> 01:51:57,910
This is "stoopid" with two O's.

2079
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,690
You don't have a shred of evidence.
You're just spinning a fairy tale.

2080
01:52:00,720 --> 01:52:02,230
Not a shred, no.

2081
01:52:02,760 --> 01:52:05,790
Just as we have no real proof
of Marta mixing up the vials,

2082
01:52:05,880 --> 01:52:06,950
so it's your word...

2083
01:52:07,040 --> 01:52:08,260
You have her confession!

2084
01:52:11,040 --> 01:52:12,260
All right, yeah.

2085
01:52:13,320 --> 01:52:14,670
Yeah, we do have that.

2086
01:52:14,760 --> 01:52:16,990
With your permission,
I'd like to spin a little further.

2087
01:52:18,040 --> 01:52:20,550
<i>Much later that night,
you'd have to come back to the house</i>

2088
01:52:20,640 --> 01:52:23,280
<i>to retrieve the incriminating
tampered vials.</i>

2089
01:52:23,360 --> 01:52:26,390
<i>However, this time the dogs were outside.</i>

2090
01:52:29,120 --> 01:52:31,190
<i>They barked, waking Meg.</i>

2091
01:52:31,280 --> 01:52:32,390
<i>No matter.</i>

2092
01:52:32,480 --> 01:52:34,310
<i>You'll get the vials tomorrow.</i>

2093
01:52:34,400 --> 01:52:36,150
But tomorrow brings news.

2094
01:52:36,240 --> 01:52:38,960
Not of a medical error and a guilty nurse,

2095
01:52:39,040 --> 01:52:41,190
but of a slit throat and a suicide.

2096
01:52:46,160 --> 01:52:48,670
<i>Now the circumstances are perfect</i>

2097
01:52:48,760 --> 01:52:50,430
<i>for the anonymous hirin' of me.</i>

2098
01:52:51,440 --> 01:52:53,630
<i>You know a crime has been committed
by Miss Cabrera.</i>

2099
01:52:53,720 --> 01:52:55,200
<i>You need her to be caught for it.</i>

2100
01:52:55,280 --> 01:52:58,150
You cannot reveal how you know.

2101
01:52:59,960 --> 01:53:01,150
Enter...

2102
01:53:01,240 --> 01:53:02,310
Benoit Blanc.

2103
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:04,910
Benny, look, I hear what you're saying,

2104
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:06,030
but this...

2105
01:53:06,520 --> 01:53:08,430
The body is discovered early
the next morning.

2106
01:53:08,520 --> 01:53:10,910
<i>The police,
the medical examiner, the family,</i>

2107
01:53:11,320 --> 01:53:13,430
everyone swarms in

2108
01:53:13,520 --> 01:53:15,270
and there is no possible way

2109
01:53:15,360 --> 01:53:18,350
you can get to Marta's medical bag
to retrieve the vials.

2110
01:53:18,440 --> 01:53:19,950
You must wait for your moment,

2111
01:53:20,040 --> 01:53:21,670
when the investigation is over

2112
01:53:21,760 --> 01:53:25,110
and you know the house will be empty.

2113
01:53:25,200 --> 01:53:26,790
And that is why

2114
01:53:27,400 --> 01:53:28,800
you missed the funeral.

2115
01:53:30,160 --> 01:53:33,910
<i>There is no one home to wonder
why you're going into Harlan's study.</i>

2116
01:53:35,160 --> 01:53:36,870
<i>Or so you think.</i>

2117
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:41,320
<i>Poor Fran.</i>

2118
01:53:41,400 --> 01:53:42,750
<i>She witnessed you tampering</i>

2119
01:53:42,840 --> 01:53:45,110
<i>with Harlan's medication
in the medical bag.</i>

2120
01:53:45,200 --> 01:53:48,470
<i>She did not know what you were doing.</i>

2121
01:53:49,200 --> 01:53:51,710
<i>But she knew you were up to no good.</i>

2122
01:53:51,800 --> 01:53:53,590
<i>So her mind begins to turn.</i>

2123
01:53:53,720 --> 01:53:54,720
<i>Oh, God.</i>

2124
01:53:55,520 --> 01:53:58,390
That Hallmark movie she told me about
with Danica McKellar...

2125
01:53:58,880 --> 01:53:59,990
<i>Deadly by Surprise.</i>

2126
01:54:00,080 --> 01:54:01,630
That's what she was talking about.

2127
01:54:01,720 --> 01:54:03,070
She loved Harlan.

2128
01:54:03,520 --> 01:54:04,870
She hates Ransom.

2129
01:54:05,320 --> 01:54:07,590
So the poor girl decides
to test her theory,

2130
01:54:07,680 --> 01:54:09,390
and make this asshole pay.

2131
01:54:09,480 --> 01:54:12,430
She gets a copy of the toxicology report.

2132
01:54:12,520 --> 01:54:15,910
Now, I will be honest, I have no idea how.

2133
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:17,320
'Cause she has a cousin.

2134
01:54:18,240 --> 01:54:21,550
She told me, she has a cousin who works as
a receptionist at the examiner's office.

2135
01:54:21,640 --> 01:54:22,860
Well, <i>voilÃ !</i>

2136
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,910
The numbers, they mean nothing to her,

2137
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:29,670
but if Ransom is guilty,
its existence is a threat,

2138
01:54:29,800 --> 01:54:32,670
so she photocopies the header
and makes her blackmail note.

2139
01:54:33,800 --> 01:54:35,150
So why did she send it to me?

2140
01:54:35,240 --> 01:54:36,310
She didn't.

2141
01:54:37,080 --> 01:54:38,710
She sent it to Ransom.

2142
01:54:43,960 --> 01:54:46,150
<i>And when Mr. Drysdale gets it,</i>

2143
01:54:46,240 --> 01:54:47,640
<i>what is his reaction?</i>

2144
01:54:48,360 --> 01:54:49,360
Elation.

2145
01:54:49,440 --> 01:54:53,400
<i>He still thinks Marta has given Harlan
the tampered drugs.</i>

2146
01:54:53,480 --> 01:54:56,120
<i>A blood tox report will prove her guilt.</i>

2147
01:54:56,240 --> 01:54:58,470
<i>He goes to the will reading
in high spirits,</i>

2148
01:54:58,560 --> 01:55:01,350
ready to see the family tear itself apart,

2149
01:55:01,440 --> 01:55:04,030
secure in the knowledge
it will be all undone

2150
01:55:04,120 --> 01:55:06,430
when the tox report comes to light.

2151
01:55:07,640 --> 01:55:09,040
And then...

2152
01:55:10,200 --> 01:55:11,710
<i>Marta's confession.</i>

2153
01:55:12,560 --> 01:55:15,200
<i>And everything turns on its head.</i>

2154
01:55:15,280 --> 01:55:19,390
<i>He now realizes that Marta
has committed no crime</i>

2155
01:55:19,480 --> 01:55:22,950
<i>and the tox report
will prove her innocence.</i>

2156
01:55:23,600 --> 01:55:25,470
<i>The changed will is gonna stand.</i>

2157
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:27,710
<i>He has lost.</i>

2158
01:55:29,560 --> 01:55:30,990
<i>Unless...</i>

2159
01:55:31,680 --> 01:55:33,350
Unless you decide...

2160
01:55:33,440 --> 01:55:36,670
- You're not gonna give up the money.
- You're not gonna give up the money.

2161
01:55:36,760 --> 01:55:39,400
- You've come this far.
- You've come this far.

2162
01:55:40,320 --> 01:55:42,230
Just one step further,

2163
01:55:42,880 --> 01:55:45,600
just one last act.

2164
01:55:45,680 --> 01:55:47,830
In for a penny, in for a pound.

2165
01:55:50,520 --> 01:55:52,350
You decide you are in.

2166
01:55:57,360 --> 01:55:58,580
<i>Step one...</i>

2167
01:55:59,920 --> 01:56:02,790
<i>Destroy all evidence of Marta's innocence.</i>

2168
01:56:09,280 --> 01:56:10,550
<i>Step two,</i>

2169
01:56:10,640 --> 01:56:12,910
<i>send her the anonymous e-mail</i>

2170
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,460
<i>with a late morning rendezvous time...</i>

2171
01:56:18,960 --> 01:56:21,990
<i>And deliver her the blackmail note.</i>

2172
01:56:24,560 --> 01:56:25,910
<i>Step three,</i>

2173
01:56:26,480 --> 01:56:28,870
<i>keep your appointment with Fran.</i>

2174
01:56:30,560 --> 01:56:32,150
Oh, I knew it.

2175
01:56:32,600 --> 01:56:34,870
I knew you were a no-good son of a bitch.

2176
01:56:35,440 --> 01:56:37,550
I knew Harlan wouldn't just kill himself.

2177
01:56:37,640 --> 01:56:39,190
Yes, Fran, you were right.

2178
01:56:39,560 --> 01:56:41,870
I knew you were guilty as shit.

2179
01:56:41,960 --> 01:56:43,910
And now you're gonna pay for it!

2180
01:56:44,320 --> 01:56:45,830
Don't you come near me.

2181
01:56:45,920 --> 01:56:48,480
Don't come near me! I'm warning you!

2182
01:56:57,920 --> 01:57:00,070
<i>See, now, now the board is set.</i>

2183
01:57:00,200 --> 01:57:02,190
<i>Marta will get the blackmail note.</i>

2184
01:57:02,280 --> 01:57:04,230
<i>You'll put the pieces together for her.</i>

2185
01:57:04,320 --> 01:57:06,070
<i>You'll guide her to the rendezvous.</i>

2186
01:57:06,160 --> 01:57:08,350
<i>You'll make the anonymous call
to the police,</i>

2187
01:57:08,440 --> 01:57:11,390
<i>they will catch her there
with the body and the burned evidence.</i>

2188
01:57:11,480 --> 01:57:14,200
Marta will get arrested for killing Fran

2189
01:57:14,280 --> 01:57:15,710
and Harlan.

2190
01:57:17,040 --> 01:57:19,150
- She said...
- You did this.

2191
01:57:20,600 --> 01:57:23,160
She didn't say, "You did this."

2192
01:57:24,560 --> 01:57:26,390
She wasn't talking about me. She said...

2193
01:57:26,480 --> 01:57:28,630
Hugh did this.

2194
01:57:28,720 --> 01:57:30,040
"Hugh did this."

2195
01:57:30,920 --> 01:57:32,990
'Cause you made the help call you "Hugh."

2196
01:57:34,440 --> 01:57:35,630
'Cause you're an asshole.

2197
01:57:37,120 --> 01:57:38,750
And it would have worked

2198
01:57:39,320 --> 01:57:41,550
if we hadn't have brought you in
for questioning

2199
01:57:41,640 --> 01:57:44,430
<i>so you could not make your anonymous call.</i>

2200
01:57:44,520 --> 01:57:45,840
<i>And if Fran had not stashed</i>

2201
01:57:45,920 --> 01:57:48,430
a safety copy of the tox report.

2202
01:57:48,520 --> 01:57:52,560
And if Marta had not
outplayed you once again.

2203
01:57:53,600 --> 01:57:55,270
<i>By having a kind heart.</i>

2204
01:57:57,640 --> 01:57:59,790
<i>By saving Fran's life,</i>

2205
01:58:00,280 --> 01:58:03,430
<i>though it meant her losing the inheritance
and going to jail.</i>

2206
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:05,910
She didn't play your game.

2207
01:58:06,600 --> 01:58:08,230
She saved Fran's life.

2208
01:58:11,560 --> 01:58:12,560
Fran's alive?

2209
01:58:13,440 --> 01:58:14,440
Oh, yes.

2210
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:16,030
Fran...

2211
01:58:16,600 --> 01:58:19,550
...who will confirm this very story

2212
01:58:20,360 --> 01:58:21,510
or something close to it.

2213
01:58:22,840 --> 01:58:25,950
And send you, Hugh,

2214
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:27,560
to jail.

2215
01:58:32,560 --> 01:58:33,560
Yes?

2216
01:58:37,120 --> 01:58:38,600
Doctor, that's great news.

2217
01:58:39,680 --> 01:58:41,590
We'll be there soon. Thank you.

2218
01:58:46,040 --> 01:58:47,040
She's okay.

2219
01:58:47,960 --> 01:58:49,110
She's ready to talk.

2220
01:58:49,960 --> 01:58:52,990
Trooper Wagner, if you could
keep Mr. Drysdale in custody

2221
01:58:53,080 --> 01:58:55,190
while Lieutenant Elliott,
Miss Cabrera, and myself,

2222
01:58:55,280 --> 01:58:57,870
we go to the hospital
and take Fran's statement.

2223
01:58:57,960 --> 01:58:59,390
All right. Up, come on.

2224
01:59:05,720 --> 01:59:07,200
I'm gonna say this just to you.

2225
01:59:07,720 --> 01:59:10,750
No cameras, no courtroom,
just you, 'cause you know it's true.

2226
01:59:11,760 --> 01:59:13,390
We allowed you into our home.

2227
01:59:13,480 --> 01:59:16,670
We let you watch our granddad.
We welcomed you into our family.

2228
01:59:16,760 --> 01:59:19,110
And now you think
you can steal it from us?

2229
01:59:19,200 --> 01:59:22,390
You think I'm not gonna fight
to protect my home,

2230
01:59:22,480 --> 01:59:24,150
our birthright,

2231
01:59:24,240 --> 01:59:26,750
our ancestral family home?

2232
01:59:29,120 --> 01:59:30,600
That is hooey.

2233
01:59:30,680 --> 01:59:32,990
Harlan, he bought this place in the '80s

2234
01:59:33,080 --> 01:59:35,610
- from a Pakistani real estate billionaire.
- Oh, shut up, Blanc!

2235
01:59:35,640 --> 01:59:41,550
Shut up! Shut up with that
Kentucky Fried Foghorn Leghorn drawl!

2236
01:59:41,640 --> 01:59:43,510
Yeah, I killed Fran. But I guess I didn't.

2237
01:59:43,600 --> 01:59:45,390
So what do you have on me?

2238
01:59:45,480 --> 01:59:47,110
Nothing. What, attempted murder?

2239
01:59:47,240 --> 01:59:49,670
I get arson for the building
and a few other charges.

2240
01:59:49,760 --> 01:59:53,230
With a good lawyer, which I have,
I'll be out in no time.

2241
01:59:53,320 --> 01:59:56,790
And then you'll see just how much hell
I can wreak on your life,

2242
01:59:56,880 --> 01:59:59,600
you vicious little bitch.

2243
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:08,430
What the shit!

2244
02:00:09,720 --> 02:00:11,270
That means she's lying!

2245
02:00:11,360 --> 02:00:12,710
Yeah, man, we know.

2246
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:14,020
That's right.

2247
02:00:14,680 --> 02:00:15,680
Fran's dead.

2248
02:00:20,120 --> 02:00:22,270
And you just confessed to her murder.

2249
02:00:34,960 --> 02:00:36,150
Well...

2250
02:00:37,320 --> 02:00:38,670
In for a penny...

2251
02:01:23,080 --> 02:01:24,190
Shit.

2252
02:02:57,400 --> 02:02:59,790
Linda!

2253
02:02:59,880 --> 02:03:02,390
We've gotta get the attorneys
on the phone right now!

2254
02:03:03,120 --> 02:03:04,120
We...

2255
02:03:10,360 --> 02:03:11,510
<i>Can I ask,</i>

2256
02:03:11,600 --> 02:03:14,750
<i>when did you know I had something to do
with Harlan's death?</i>

2257
02:03:15,880 --> 02:03:18,670
From the first moment
you set foot in front of me.

2258
02:03:23,920 --> 02:03:25,030
Oh, shit.

2259
02:03:25,120 --> 02:03:28,110
I want you to remember something
that's very important.

2260
02:03:29,480 --> 02:03:30,630
You won,

2261
02:03:30,720 --> 02:03:33,470
not by playing the game Harlan's way...

2262
02:03:34,320 --> 02:03:35,430
but yours.

2263
02:03:37,840 --> 02:03:39,030
You're a good person.

2264
02:03:41,280 --> 02:03:42,710
This family...

2265
02:03:49,080 --> 02:03:51,190
I should help them. Right?

2266
02:03:52,120 --> 02:03:54,550
Well, I have my opinion,

2267
02:03:56,120 --> 02:03:58,430
but I have a feeling
you'll follow your heart.
