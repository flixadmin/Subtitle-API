1
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:03,285
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:03,378 --> 00:00:05,665
- The Doc? You know him?
- I know the Doc.

3
00:00:05,756 --> 00:00:08,794
<i>Sometimes we search
for things we don't wish to find.</i>

4
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:10,216
I enjoy being the queen of Gotham.

5
00:00:10,302 --> 00:00:11,543
Glad we understand each other.

6
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:13,799
There are other ways
for me to hurt you.

7
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:15,714
Something's eating at you, Jim.

8
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:17,924
And you're not gonna feel clean
till you get it off your chest.

9
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:20,680
That's done now.

10
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:23,604
I'm at Sofia Falcone's.
I just shot and killed the Pyg.

11
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,731
<i>I see Arkham's treating you well.</i>

12
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:27,228
Goodbye, Oswald.

13
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:30,149
<i>"I am held captive.
All my brilliance locked away."</i>

14
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:31,605
<i>You're still there.</i>

15
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,109
<i>And you're gonna help me
find a way out of here.</i>

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,190
I need a name.

17
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:35,365
- Ivy Pepper.
- I know Ivy.

18
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:38,240
<i>No, Gordon, she's changed.
Like a lot.</i>

19
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,446
Called Lazarus Water.

20
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:41,326
<i>What are you going
to do with it?</i>

21
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,203
<i>I'm going to make miracles happen.</i>

22
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:47,003
You'll reel it in a little,
or should I call your keeper?

23
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:48,879
- Alfred? He won't answer.
<i>- Why?</i>

24
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:50,047
<i>'Cause I fired him.</i>

25
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:48,189
Where's the other guy who works here?

26
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:49,398
You mean, Harvey?

27
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:52,022
He's out sick.
You wanna leave a message?

28
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,322
I do.

29
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:01,653
All right.

30
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,037
What should I say?

31
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:04,785
Nothing.

32
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,408
Because all of you,

33
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:11,087
with your blood and your flesh,

34
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:13,665
and what you will become...

35
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,463
You are the message.

36
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:39,065
He was a good man.

37
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:43,407
Doesn't matter that Mario's gone,
you'll always be my sister.

38
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:46,497
For Falcones, it's all about family.

39
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:48,078
I appreciate that.

40
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,252
So, sister to sister...

41
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:54,171
We're not really here
to look at photographs.

42
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,253
There's only one neighborhood
in Gotham that hasn't bent the knee.

43
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,881
The Narrows has never submitted
to an outside boss.

44
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,641
There's never been someone
like me ruling Gotham.

45
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:07,468
Okay.

46
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,057
What do you want?

47
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:10,262
A tax.

48
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:14,810
Thirty percent on all income coming
from The Narrows, legal and illegal.

49
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:18,734
Every family there lives
hand to mouth. They'll starve.

50
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,069
We all have to make sacrifices.

51
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:24,235
I'll need an answer
by the end of the day.

52
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:30,996
You want me to kiss the ring?
I'll do it.

53
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:34,121
To keep the peace. But what you're
asking for is impossible.

54
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,131
You'll find a way.

55
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:40,668
Thought it was all about family.

56
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,672
Never said it was a happy family.

57
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:54,724
Thank you.

58
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,827
Thank you for meeting me.

59
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:17,922
My parents' foundation is having
their annual dinner tonight.

60
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:19,169
I thought we could go.

61
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,875
Somehow, I don't think you got me
all the way down here

62
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,926
to talk about a fundraiser, did you?

63
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:28,762
Bruce, what exactly is it that
you want from me?

64
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,189
Help.

65
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:40,319
Figuring this out.
I can't do it alone, I...

66
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:44,065
Alfred, I need your help.

67
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:50,529
No.

68
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:54,909
What?

69
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:58,087
Listen, you can't just waltz back
in here and expect me to go

70
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:00,916
and clean your smalls and cook
your tea. After what you've done.

71
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,921
Alfred, I'm not asking for that.
I've changed.

72
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,047
You have, have you?

73
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,379
It's one thing saying
that you've changed,

74
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:08,260
and another actually changing.

75
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:14,062
So show me. Show me how you've
changed, and I might reconsider.

76
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:18,440
Show you how?

77
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,237
That's for you to figure out, innit?

78
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,993
I'm asking as a friend.

79
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,331
I'm not your friend.

80
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:41,790
I was your butler.

81
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:44,842
And you fired me.

82
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:51,307
He'll pay for the tea, miss.

83
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:04,817
Sure hope Lee is gonna
figure something out with Sofia.

84
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:06,697
Lee being the love
of your life and all.

85
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:08,741
We're friends.

86
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,865
You know, those koo-koo pills
aren't gonna make me go away.

87
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,623
Well, they have stopped you
from getting out

88
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,452
and trying to kill Lee again.
So works for me.

89
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,537
Mail arrived.

90
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:26,793
Oh, who's it from?

91
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:28,712
Oswald.

92
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:32,799
"I want to apologize...
Can we be friends again?"

93
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:35,510
What? I'm never gonna forgive him.

94
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:37,561
I think it's a nice letter.

95
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,889
- Shut up!
- Hey, Ed.

96
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,266
What has two eyes but can't see?

97
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,318
What has two...

98
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,155
Good lord.

99
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,950
This is new. More aggressive.

100
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:02,670
The plants are literally bursting
through their flesh.

101
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:08,130
You! Get away from that! Now!

102
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,335
Now.

103
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,217
Same flower growing out
of these bodies.

104
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:14,344
That's a weapon?

105
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,303
Gordon, this must be what Ivy
did with the Lazarus Water.

106
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,763
Used it to increase
the potency of a toxic plant.

107
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,769
- The seeds made it airborne...
- Where's Bullock?

108
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,691
- What?
- He works here.

109
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,444
Harvey killed Ivy's father.

110
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:37,993
Too late.

111
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,452
No, we're not.

112
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:40,866
Hey.

113
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:42,459
Hey!

114
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,170
Damn it, Jim!

115
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:46,918
Jim, what the hell?

116
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,212
Hey, someone's paying for that door!

117
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,338
Ivy Pepper.

118
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,761
- Who?
- Mario Pepper's kid.

119
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,554
She's been working on some biotech.

120
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,382
She attacked your bar.

121
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,008
It's bad.

122
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,178
Donnie, the bartender...

123
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:02,934
I'm sorry.

124
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:04,348
Oh, God!

125
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:08,148
Look, I gotta think
that you were the target.

126
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:12,732
Jim, I only shot Ivy Pepper's dad
because I was saving your stupid eye.

127
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,487
You can't put this on me.

128
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,614
- I'm not putting it on you.
- Guys.

129
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,405
<i>We have decided to share the footage.</i>

130
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,582
<i>So in a moment the video
we are about to show you</i>

131
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,955
<i>is from a tape received this morning.</i>

132
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:26,037
<i>And again, let me warn you.</i>

133
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:28,210
<i>It is very disturbing.</i>

134
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,542
<i>Plants love us.</i>

135
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:37,682
<i>They give us food, shelter,
the very air we breathe.</i>

136
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,517
<i>But what do we do in return?</i>

137
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:45,348
<i>Kill them. Because that's our nature.</i>

138
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:49,644
<i>We cause pain.</i>

139
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:57,076
<i>Everyone I've known
has only hurt or betrayed me.</i>

140
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:01,322
<i>Maybe I've always known in my heart
what I needed to do.</i>

141
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,868
<i>But I finally
have the power to do so.</i>

142
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:09,497
<i>I'm giving your city
back to the plants.</i>

143
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:11,715
<i>Starting with the people who hurt me.</i>

144
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:17,213
<i>So if that's you,
your time is coming.</i>

145
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:22,013
- Guess we know what she's up to.
- Yeah.

146
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:24,015
She's gonna kill everyone in Gotham.

147
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:26,313
Starting with me.

148
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,439
<i>Preliminary reports indicate
that similar tapes have been delivered</i>

149
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,364
<i>to multiple news organizations.</i>

150
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,358
Wait a minute.

151
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:40,194
What's that there?

152
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:42,658
Sully's Eatery.

153
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,704
That's in Ives Square.
House must be right across.

154
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:47,410
You should go to the precinct.

155
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:49,996
Hey, I'm not hiding
like some freaking coward. All right?

156
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,332
Four people are dead
because she wanted me.

157
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:55,759
Okay, then we'll work on it together.
You can wear the badge.

158
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,838
Get this straight, Jim.
I ain't working for you now or ever.

159
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:01,633
I got more contacts in The Narrows
than any of you.

160
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,518
I'm gonna find her. Alone.

161
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:10,979
Once I find my pants.

162
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,190
Doesn't make any sense.

163
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,784
There's no money here.

164
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,406
Okay, so it's about power.

165
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,664
I offered to bend the knee.

166
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:31,246
She's asking for something
she knew I couldn't give.

167
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:33,755
She wants...

168
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,126
She wants to punish me.

169
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,173
For what?

170
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:42,006
I don't know.
But you can't fight an enemy

171
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,513
whose motivations
you don't understand, Lee.

172
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:54,477
You are the greatest spies
in all of Gotham.

173
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:57,438
You have eyes and ears everywhere.

174
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:03,202
The survival of The Narrows
depends upon you.

175
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:09,492
Whoever learns why Sofia Falcone
wants to destroy Lee Thompkins

176
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:13,580
will receive
a complete set of encyclopedias.

177
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,251
Minus the T.

178
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:20,340
Plus 20 bucks.

179
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,137
- Yes!
- Yeah!

180
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:23,343
Go get 'em.

181
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:32,856
We're moving, clear.

182
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,277
She wasn't bluffing.

183
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,656
With this many plants, she could kill
hundreds if not thousands of people.

184
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,318
Search the other room for any signs
of where she's heading.

185
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,205
What are you gonna do to her?

186
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,293
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

187
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:03,095
I just saw the news.

188
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,297
She killed four more people today.

189
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:08,467
You knew where she was staying.
If you had told me,

190
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,762
- we could've saved lives.
- Or not.

191
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:14,644
I mean, you couldn't even stop her
from hypnotizing your own cops.

192
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,317
So why did you come here?

193
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:21,359
To try to reason with her.

194
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,782
Have you heard a word she said?
She's a fanatic.

195
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:24,858
She's my friend.

196
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,156
What do you expect me to do?

197
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:30,073
She contacts you again, call me.

198
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:33,125
I'll try and find her,
and bring her in quietly.

199
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:35,369
Otherwise, stay out of her way.

200
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,673
Harvey?

201
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:42,505
Hey, I got a lead.

202
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:44,299
Great.

203
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:49,342
I knocked some heads.

204
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:52,849
Heard a hot redhead was poking around
in that dive bar next door.

205
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:55,147
That is the place in The Narrows
for low-end muscle.

206
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:57,190
So I figured,
if she was planning something big,

207
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:58,768
she might've gone there to recruit.

208
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:00,478
That's the back entrance.

209
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,028
That's where my contact said that...

210
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,659
Hello, Detective Gordon.

211
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:10,203
On the ground. Now.
Harvey, call it in.

212
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,873
She's beautiful,
don't you think, Jim?

213
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,415
Drop your weapon.

214
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:25,969
You don't look good.

215
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,384
I think you might be exceeding
your recommended dosage.

216
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:32,347
Are you experiencing
"trembling extremities"?

217
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:36,556
Check. "Cognitive impairment"?
Definite check.

218
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,312
Though to be fair,
how would you know?

219
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,022
Shut up!

220
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:43,695
Take all the pills you want, Ed.
I'm only getting stronger.

221
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:47,779
Soon I'm gonna be out,
and the fun begins.

222
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:50,987
No. I won't let you.
'Cause I know what you'll do.

223
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,946
Oh, you mean kill Lee?

224
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:56,917
Yeah, I guess I will do that.
And you can't stop me.

225
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:58,585
There are things that I can do.

226
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,958
Like what? You need to face it, pal.

227
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:03,336
The only way you'll get
rid of me is to kill yourself.

228
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,087
I guess you are smarter than me.

229
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,342
- You wouldn't actually...
- Oh, yeah.

230
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:17,930
Oh, yeah.

231
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:21,309
I said drop the gun, Jim.

232
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:31,326
Do you believe in fate,
Detective Gordon?

233
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:35,952
I went out today to test my plants
on the man who shot my father.

234
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:40,707
He wasn't there.
That's disappointing.

235
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,918
Then he found me.

236
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:49,303
And I realized I could make him
deliver his partner as well.

237
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,256
Fate.

238
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,387
Stay strong, Harvey.
She's controlling you.

239
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:55,763
I kinda like it, Jim.

240
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:57,765
Sweet surrender.

241
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:00,264
You need help, Ivy.

242
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,645
Let me find Selina.
She wants to help.

243
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:03,725
Quiet.

244
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,023
I have to go.

245
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:08,481
Big plans tonight.
Lots of people to kill.

246
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,237
- Detective Bullock?
- Ma'am.

247
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:15,196
After you kill your partner, be sure
to shoot yourself in the head, okay?

248
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,279
Copy that.

249
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,330
Harvey...

250
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,041
Don't even try
and talk your way out of this.

251
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:30,173
I wouldn't. But, quick question.

252
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,972
Is Ivy's hair more auburn or scarlet?

253
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,641
I, uh...

254
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,472
That's a good...

255
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,860
You think I didn't come prepared, huh?

256
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,731
You always underestimate me.

257
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,068
That's not why I'm shooting you.

258
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,613
I just think
we should, uh, clear the air.

259
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,075
What do you wanna talk about?
I'm all ears.

260
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:05,212
How you stole my job for starters.

261
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:08,628
Was it really your job, though?

262
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,839
I mean, you only got it
'cause one captain died

263
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,295
and the other one went nuts.

264
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:14,470
Like hell!

265
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:17,720
I paid my dues! I earned that job,
and you took it!

266
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,427
You mean like the time
you gut-shot Officer Patel?

267
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,522
That was a mistake.

268
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:27,021
Hey, give yourself some credit.

269
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,190
You did shoot her
from across the room.

270
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,817
Although you couldn't
face her later, remember?

271
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,659
You didn't have the courage to
meet her the next day, did you?

272
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:38,950
- You coward.
- Screw you!

273
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:04,679
- We're not open.
- I wanted to see you.

274
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:07,812
Why? Because you weren't big enough
of an ass the last time I saw you?

275
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:10,689
- Selina...
- I don't have time for this, Bruce.

276
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:12,855
Something happened.

277
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:16,029
- I need to talk to someone.
- Okay, then go find Alfred.

278
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:19,948
Oh...

279
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:23,915
You did, and he wanted nothing
to do with you.

280
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,081
Smart guy, Alfred.

281
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,793
- Can you at least hear me out?
- No, Bruce.

282
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,419
Because Ivy's out there
killing people

283
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,967
and I need to find her and stop her.

284
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,636
So whatever problem
you have going on right now,

285
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,133
you need to figure it out.

286
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,386
I mean, say sorry to Alfred.

287
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:44,136
'Cause I'm sure whatever happened
was your fault.

288
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:54,067
According to my spies,

289
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:58,655
Sofia and Jim
were carrying out an affair

290
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:01,161
till Jim ended it.

291
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,288
So, technically,

292
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:06,997
your ex has been sleeping with your
dead husband's mafiosa sister...

293
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,452
Okay, I get it.

294
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:14,045
If Sofia was sleeping
with the captain of the GCPD,

295
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:16,878
it was a power play. And it failed.

296
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,591
I'm her next step.

297
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:23,718
Why don't I just give her
what she wants?

298
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:26,227
Power over Jim Gordon.

299
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:29,314
You would do that?

300
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:32,480
I'm not trying to get back at Jim,
though he deserves it.

301
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:36,738
My job is to make sure that
the people of The Narrows are safe.

302
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:39,532
And I will do everything
in my power to ensure that.

303
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:46,285
What?

304
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:48,746
Lee, I...

305
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:54,873
I...

306
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:59,753
I have to leave.

307
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:15,277
- Harvey. Harvey, come on, buddy.
- Where am I?

308
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,480
You were hypnotized.
I need you to focus.

309
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:21,279
Did Ivy give you any clue
about who she's targeting next?

310
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,026
I can't believe I let her get to me.

311
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,863
Hey, you wanna help? Here's how.
Did she say anything?

312
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:31,125
Something about,
"They get rich by murdering plants."

313
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,836
So she's targeting
a group of rich people.

314
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:39,509
At her place, she was trying on
fancy clothes, fancy shoes.

315
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,048
A party?

316
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:43,380
She said she had big plans,
couldn't be late.

317
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,929
- Yeah, black tie.
- No, no, no, come on.

318
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,136
Fancy schmancy, like a charity
for hobos or something.

319
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,722
Wayne Foundation's
annual dinner is tonight

320
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,098
over at Gotham Square.

321
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,808
All right. Get the strike force.

322
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,565
I want full body armor,
gas masks, nonlethal rounds.

323
00:19:58,698 --> 00:19:59,814
To fight plants?

324
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:03,442
When Ivy got me, she was hypnotizing
a bunch of low-end muscle.

325
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:04,609
Go.

326
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,790
We could really use you there, Harv.

327
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,418
Jim, she got in my head.

328
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,622
I really...
I just don't trust myself right now.

329
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,712
All right, you can help out here.
Man the phones.

330
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:25,965
Hey, Jim.

331
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:30,476
I spent too long
putting this all on you.

332
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,350
What happened between us.

333
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:38,189
The fact is I only got
myself to blame.

334
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:43,941
I'll call.

335
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:08,431
And now, ladies and gentleman,

336
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:13,687
please welcome to the stage
our host Bruce Wayne.

337
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,034
Good evening.

338
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:31,204
Welcome to the third annual dinner

339
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,873
for the Thomas and
Martha Wayne Foundation.

340
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,327
This year we disbursed $4 million...

341
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:44,880
Um...

342
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:51,346
We disbursed $4 million and, uh...

343
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,817
My parents spent their
lives helping people.

344
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:15,532
I was so proud of them, and I always
wanted them to be proud of me.

345
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,880
And then I saw them get murdered.

346
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:28,091
I survived because someone in
my life kept me going.

347
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:32,428
He's been everything to me.

348
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:35,723
A teacher,

349
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:37,850
a protector.

350
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:42,643
He's been a father to me.

351
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,572
I hope...

352
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:50,199
I hope he can see that.

353
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:54,988
And give me another chance.

354
00:22:58,794 --> 00:22:59,955
Thank you.

355
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,510
Thank you.

356
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:16,768
That meant a great deal.

357
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,138
But I can't help you.

358
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:25,273
Not until you accept
who you really are.

359
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:29,948
I know who I am,
I've seen what's inside of me.

360
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,074
Darkness and anger?

361
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:34,114
But what's beneath that?

362
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:37,489
It's a heart that feels pain.

363
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:40,826
Your heart is what makes you
want to help other people.

364
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:42,911
Your heart is your strength.

365
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,753
Deny the darkness and you deny that.

366
00:23:49,303 --> 00:23:52,137
But accepting that is something that
you must do on your own.

367
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:53,679
Do you understand me?

368
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,557
I was stupid for reaching out.

369
00:24:05,736 --> 00:24:07,227
That was quite a speech.

370
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:08,979
Hello all.

371
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:12,274
I'm Ivy Pepper.

372
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:15,193
No, no, no, please.

373
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,237
Stay seated.

374
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,342
<i>Can I just say?</i>

375
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:37,640
This is crazy!

376
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,927
Well, this whole thing

377
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:42,353
was your idea.

378
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:45,982
And you're the smart one,
as you always tell me.

379
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:47,354
Very funny.

380
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:50,813
Okay, fine! Fine!

381
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,405
You win!

382
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:55,905
- What?
- You win.

383
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:59,700
You beat me.
Is that what you wanna hear?

384
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,873
That is very nice.

385
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,875
But I still have to do it.

386
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,496
Wait! Wait!

387
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,706
Wait! What if there's a way

388
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:11,715
to do this where nobody gets hurt?

389
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:14,214
I don't believe you.

390
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:16,637
So you're just going to kill yourself
without hearing me out?

391
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,008
I'm telling you, Ed.

392
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:23,095
There is a way to save Lee
without killing yourself.

393
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:26,564
Or killing us.

394
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,111
I'm listening.

395
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:39,111
Aren't these crimson flowers lovely?

396
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:46,993
You're a handsome man.

397
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:50,376
But you want more from life.

398
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:51,998
I can feel it.

399
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,268
Bruce, is Ivy Pepper in there?

400
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:04,434
Ivy?

401
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:06,103
No, I didn't see her.

402
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:08,727
Get out of here.

403
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:09,978
Let's go!

404
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:13,356
Breach that door.

405
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:25,911
We

406
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:28,372
are going to turn this room

407
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:32,790
into the most gorgeous garden
the world has ever seen.

408
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,255
All you have to do

409
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:39,884
is take a deep breath.

410
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:43,884
Oh,

411
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:45,935
a volunteer.

412
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:51,350
GCPD!

413
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,356
Drop your guns. On the ground, now!

414
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,072
Kill everyone.

415
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:11,544
You got this, I'm going after Ivy.

416
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,667
I'm getting you out of here.
Come on, let's go.

417
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:53,369
Listen, listen.

418
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:55,330
People need your help.

419
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:58,675
This is who you are.

420
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,311
Watch the door.
I'm gonna go look for him.

421
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:21,607
Where'd you go, punk?
You can run, but you can't hide.

422
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:33,542
Hey! Hey!

423
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:35,378
- Drop it!
- No!

424
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:47,802
Hey. Hey.

425
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:42,862
You hear the news?

426
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:47,199
"Crazy Ivy Pepper attacks
the Wayne Foundation dinner."

427
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:52,576
I'll be honest. The evening didn't
turn out quite the way I'd hoped.

428
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:56,371
You mean you didn't
get to kill everyone in there?

429
00:29:57,254 --> 00:29:58,540
Something like that.

430
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:00,247
You got out.

431
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:02,082
Made it back here.

432
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:07,503
You always were the survivor.

433
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,340
No, you taught me that, Selina.

434
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,849
What's in the bag, Ivy?

435
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:25,859
It's the last of the Lazarus Water

436
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,315
I stole from Wayne Enterprises.

437
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:29,946
So you can go

438
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:32,279
and make more plants to kill people?

439
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:38,872
Yeah, that ain't gonna happen.

440
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:44,090
Are you gonna stop me, Selina?

441
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:47,506
You're gonna remind me

442
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,053
of the old days?

443
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:51,548
Tell me I'm not this person?

444
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:54,885
No, I think we're past words now.

445
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:05,353
Well,

446
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:06,904
Selina Kyle

447
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,444
turns out to be the hero.

448
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:16,534
I'm no hero.

449
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,082
One scratch is all it takes, Selina.

450
00:31:27,094 --> 00:31:29,051
And there's no antidote this time.

451
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:32,092
And there's no more
jumping across rooftops

452
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:34,469
for little dead Selina.

453
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:36,308
I'll keep that in mind.

454
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:43,899
You're gonna
have to fight me, Selina.

455
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:46,773
You can't run forever.

456
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:50,864
I wasn't running.

457
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:53,450
I was getting this.

458
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,243
This is what you're gonna use
to make all your little plants?

459
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:02,828
So, I guess it's safe to say
that I shouldn't drop it.

460
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,378
Stop, Selina.

461
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:06,831
I will let you leave.

462
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,166
Let me?

463
00:32:10,971 --> 00:32:15,136
You're not gonna turn me into
some geranium-type thing?

464
00:32:16,977 --> 00:32:18,843
That's so generous.

465
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:21,600
No!

466
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:27,401
How can you side with them?

467
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:31,488
All the people who hurt us.

468
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:36,698
You think they're innocent?

469
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,906
They're guilty.

470
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:43,914
Every person in this city,

471
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,287
they spew out poison.

472
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:50,174
How are you not choking on it?

473
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:55,175
The only thing that I'm choking on,
Ivy, is your insanity.

474
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:07,392
You shouldn't have done that.

475
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:10,774
Now, you're gonna die.

476
00:33:10,864 --> 00:33:12,230
Ivy, look down.

477
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,366
- Well?
- Yeah.

478
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:29,297
So, what happens now?
We kill each other?

479
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:30,589
That's an option.

480
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,838
You always did think
you were better than me.

481
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:35,795
That's not true. I was your friend.

482
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:39,215
We were friends, Ivy.
You said so yourself.

483
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:44,019
That was a long time ago.

484
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:46,893
I'm a different person now.

485
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:53,236
This isn't what I want.

486
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:12,714
Don't get in my way again.

487
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,142
Lift your hands up.
Got any weapons?

488
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:35,988
I'd almost think this wasn't
going to be a friendly conversation.

489
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:37,816
Just being careful.

490
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,070
- They're clean.
- Okay.

491
00:34:39,953 --> 00:34:41,114
Smart lady.

492
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:45,748
So, you said you wanted 30% of
everything in The Narrows?

493
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,748
What if I told you I had something
more valuable to offer?

494
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:52,080
Such as?

495
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:54,919
Jim Gordon.

496
00:34:57,721 --> 00:35:00,088
I know crimes he's committed
no one else does.

497
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:02,511
It would give you control over him.

498
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:06,260
Surely that's worth more
than 30% of this.

499
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:08,225
I have my own dirt on Jim Gordon.

500
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:09,847
But you can't use it.

501
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:13,564
Otherwise, you wouldn't be sitting
there threatening me,

502
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,398
would you?

503
00:35:18,742 --> 00:35:19,858
Sofia?

504
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,077
Take my deal.

505
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:31,502
I have a better way to
bring Gordon around.

506
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:35,965
No! No!

507
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:40,423
Stay with me, stay with me.

508
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:46,058
You're never gonna
get out of here alive.

509
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:47,559
My people are going to kill you.

510
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:50,980
Your people?
Who do you think planted these guns?

511
00:35:51,775 --> 00:35:53,266
You can come out.

512
00:35:57,947 --> 00:35:59,063
How you doing, Doc?

513
00:36:01,618 --> 00:36:03,405
I'm having Sampson run The Narrows.

514
00:36:03,787 --> 00:36:06,404
You should have killed me
when you had the chance.

515
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:09,286
The fact that you didn't told me
everything I needed to know.

516
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:17,628
Since we're family, I'm only
going to do one hand.

517
00:36:33,483 --> 00:36:35,145
Throw her on the streets.

518
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:38,852
Let The Narrows see their queen.

519
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,742
The scene here remains
largely under control,

520
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:54,953
but Ivy Pepper remains at large.

521
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:58,255
Now inside we have
a team of investigators...

522
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:08,800
Yeah.

523
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:11,845
What?

524
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:14,222
Where is she?

525
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:25,900
Sir?

526
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:27,784
Sir?

527
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:29,285
Excuse me?

528
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:31,034
Are you family?

529
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,249
I'm a cop.

530
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:38,208
She wouldn't tell us who did it.

531
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:46,174
She doesn't have to.

532
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:58,190
Arkham doesn't get many volunteers.

533
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:01,359
You do know who I am, right?

534
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:04,355
Criminally insane
pretty much covers it.

535
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:06,198
Read.

536
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,365
And sign.

537
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:09,155
I'll be back.

538
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,543
I hate that you were
right about this.

539
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,791
But it'll keep her safe.

540
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,665
Hey, Ed?

541
00:38:22,759 --> 00:38:24,250
What has two eyes but can't see?

542
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:25,425
This again.

543
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:27,219
Two needles.

544
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,263
Half of Mississippi, who cares?

545
00:38:32,602 --> 00:38:34,309
You should, Ed.

546
00:38:41,194 --> 00:38:42,856
I knew you'd come.

547
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,855
I knew you'd understand my letter.

548
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,157
How did you know I'd be...

549
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,492
What are you talking about?

550
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:52,444
I'm not talking to you, Ed.

551
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:55,747
I'm talking to him.

552
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:00,624
He read my letter.

553
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:05,082
Read the first word of each sentence.

554
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:12,348
"Please bring Ed to Arkham,
so I can set you free."

555
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,886
What has two eyes,

556
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:16,014
but can't see what's
happening in front of him.

557
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:18,061
- Ed Nygma!
- No.

558
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:20,893
I came here to save Lee.

559
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:22,816
He read my letter.

560
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,018
You...

561
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:26,107
You're wrong!

562
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:27,688
I am Ed!

563
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:29,648
Edward Nygma, that is it!

564
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:32,281
Lee believes in me.
She sees me for who I am.

565
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,327
But I see him,

566
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:35,741
- Ed.
- No.

567
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:41,160
Lee Thompkins may have made
Ed strong,

568
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,795
but I see the other you.

569
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,256
One whose name I wouldn't speak.

570
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,677
But because he has earned it

571
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,845
and because I need him,

572
00:39:56,686 --> 00:39:58,052
- I'm saying now.
- No!

573
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:01,856
- Please, please don't.
- I need you.

574
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:03,557
Please...

575
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:05,018
Riddler.

576
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:29,709
Shall we get to work?

577
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:41,970
So?

578
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:45,265
How'd you make it off the roof then?

579
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:48,815
A fire escape on the next building.

580
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:51,647
Why'd you run from Gordon?

581
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,362
I mean, you could've told him,
it was you.

582
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:58,324
I don't know.

583
00:41:01,751 --> 00:41:04,869
I just couldn't.

584
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:10,548
I'm going to help people, Alfred.

585
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:16,135
And if that means accepting
every part of myself, good and bad,

586
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:19,383
then I will.

587
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:24,847
I do.

588
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:27,933
It's what my parents would've wanted.

589
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:31,528
Your parents would've
been very proud of you.

590
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:36,867
I'm proud of you.

591
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:44,200
Alfred?

592
00:41:45,545 --> 00:41:46,831
If you'd

593
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:49,296
need a ride back to Gotham,
I can drive you.

594
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:52,382
I'm not going anywhere, sir.

595
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:55,843
I'm home.

596
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,987
Congratulations.

597
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:16,573
I heard you saved the day.

598
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:18,282
Good job.

599
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:22,363
There's a reason you're
captain and I'm a

600
00:42:22,582 --> 00:42:25,416
50-year-old screwup,
pouring shots for barflies.

601
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:31,414
There's a reason, all right,
but it's not what you think.

602
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:36,217
I screwed up, Harv.

603
00:42:37,472 --> 00:42:38,679
I screwed up bad.

604
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,347
And I'm gonna need your
help to make it right.

605
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:45,352
Sofia hired the Pyg.

606
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:48,605
And I knew.

607
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:52,104
I knew...

608
00:42:53,863 --> 00:42:55,104
And I covered it up.

609
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:08,075
And now, I'm gonna take her down.
