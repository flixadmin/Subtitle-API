00:00:01,366 --> 00:00:05,270
<i>In 2166, an immortal tyrant
named Vandal Savage</i>

3
00:00:05,272 --> 00:00:07,873
<i>conquered the world
and murdered my wife and child.</i>

4
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:10,843
<i>I have assembled an elite team
to hunt him throughout time</i>

5
00:00:10,845 --> 00:00:12,344
<i>and stop his rise to power.</i>

6
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:14,813
<i>Unfortunately, my plan
is opposed by the body</i>

7
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:17,883
<i>I'd sworn my allegiance to,
the Time Masters.</i>

8
00:00:17,885 --> 00:00:20,185
<i>In the future, my friends
may not be heroes,</i>

9
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:22,121
<i>but if we succeed,</i>

10
00:00:22,123 --> 00:00:25,457
<i>they will be remembered
as legends.</i>

11
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,794
<i>Previously on
"Legends of Tomorrow"...</i>

12
00:00:28,796 --> 00:00:30,362
Time masters.

13
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,031
They took me to a place
called the vanishing point.

14
00:00:32,033 --> 00:00:35,200
I've spent lifetimes
training by them

15
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:37,362
<i>Mr. Jackson's internal organs</i>

16
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:38,901
<i>are aging
at an accelerated rate.</i>

17
00:00:38,906 --> 00:00:40,636
<i>The rest of his body
will soon follow.</i>

18
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:41,807
The trip through
the time stream

19
00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:43,642
should reverse you condition.

20
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:47,579
If we're separated,
you'll die.

21
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:51,741
This man you've brought before
us is needed back in 2166.

22
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:53,412
- Take him away.
- What?

23
00:00:53,421 --> 00:00:56,221
<i>Search their ship
for the others.</i>

24
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:58,357
- You're under arrest.
- Mick, what's going on?

25
00:00:58,359 --> 00:00:59,859
We need to find
somewhere to hide.

26
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,660
<i>I need to be getting back
to 2166.</i>

27
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:05,731
I've been waiting to meet
your family.

28
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:08,000
And because if you don't
follow me,

29
00:01:08,002 --> 00:01:12,438
this is what is in store for
your world 150 years from now.

30
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:29,888
I could have chosen
any time and any place.

31
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,723
Of all the people
who ever lived,

32
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:33,125
I chose you eight.

33
00:01:33,127 --> 00:01:35,594
I certainly hope
that you won't let me,

34
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:37,596
and the world, down.

35
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:47,573
If your answer is yes,

36
00:01:47,575 --> 00:01:49,308
meet me at this address
in 36 hours.

37
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:54,880
So what do you think?

38
00:01:54,882 --> 00:01:57,649
I think that's five minutes
of my life I'm not getting back.

39
00:01:57,651 --> 00:02:00,586
He just showed us
the entire world in flames.

40
00:02:00,588 --> 00:02:01,820
You can't turn your back
on that.

41
00:02:01,822 --> 00:02:03,822
Observe.

42
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:07,459
Well, I think we can
all agree

43
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:08,661
that the mission will go
a whole lot better

44
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:09,928
without those two.

45
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,263
I haven't signed on yet.

46
00:02:11,265 --> 00:02:12,765
And I'm not signing on
at all.

47
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:14,426
- Jefferson...
- No.

48
00:02:14,435 --> 00:02:16,835
I'm not going off to die
in some apocalyptic future.

49
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:21,006
I'm staying right here
in the present.

50
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:23,942
Let me talk to him.

51
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:27,146
Jefferson, can we at least
discuss this?

52
00:02:27,148 --> 00:02:28,814
Oh, that's a first.

53
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:30,416
And it was always you
trying to tell me what to do.

54
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:31,917
It's not happening this time.

55
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:34,119
But if the fate of the world
is at stake...

56
00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:37,022
then the world can find
somebody more capable than me.

57
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:39,258
I have confidence in us
as Firestorm.

58
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,426
All right, look,
just sleep on it.

59
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:43,929
Come to my office tomorrow,
and if your answer's still no...

60
00:02:43,931 --> 00:02:45,898
it will be.

61
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:55,007
Grey, we need to talk.

62
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:57,176
We were just talking.

63
00:02:57,178 --> 00:03:00,012
How did you change your clothes
so fast?

64
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:02,648
Something called time travel.

65
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,183
I need your help.

66
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:07,953
The team's in trouble.

67
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,571
Martin, are you okay?

68
00:03:25,573 --> 00:03:29,141
I'm required to merge
with Jefferson...

69
00:03:29,143 --> 00:03:32,010
Periodically in order
to maintain nuclear cohesion.

70
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:33,645
Then sending him away
on the jumpship

71
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:36,014
probably wasn't
the greatest idea.

72
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:37,749
Given the circumstances
we're under,

73
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:39,751
I'm surprised any of us
are alive.

74
00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:42,554
Oh, you'll be dead soon.

75
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,489
You're getting off easy.

76
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:46,825
What gives you the free pass?

77
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:50,529
- They have other plans for me.
- As Chronos.

78
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:51,897
They're gonna try
and put me through

79
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:54,166
the induction process again.

80
00:03:54,168 --> 00:03:56,868
- Brainwashing?
- Kills most men, Professor.

81
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,904
And those that don't die,

82
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:01,940
end up like mindless goats.

83
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:03,208
But Snart said
you weren't mindless

84
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:04,409
when you were Chronos.

85
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:06,078
Not any more that usual,
anyway.

86
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:10,549
The whole time,
I stayed focused on one thing.

87
00:04:10,551 --> 00:04:13,952
The one thing
that kept me sane...

88
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:15,420
Vengeance.

89
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:19,091
I focused on how much
I hated all of you.

90
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:22,894
Ah, gentlemen,
I missed you.

91
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:25,464
Come on in.

92
00:04:25,466 --> 00:04:28,867
Ah, that's it.
Oh, yeah, break my arm.

93
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:32,804
Hey, what are you doing?
Why are you taking her?

94
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:34,473
Hey!

95
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:45,784
Hey!

96
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:48,487
Kendra!

97
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:50,122
Kendra!

98
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:05,537
Leave us.

99
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:10,942
I have a query.

100
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:12,744
Why haven't
we killed you yet?

101
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:14,913
That's what you've been trying
to do all this time.

102
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:16,648
Fortunately for you,

103
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,350
two of your crew
are still at large.

104
00:05:18,352 --> 00:05:19,751
Tell me where to find them,

105
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:21,520
and I'll spare the others.

106
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:24,323
If it is anything like the
offer you gave me in the USSR,

107
00:05:24,325 --> 00:05:25,757
I'm sorely tempted.

108
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,826
You were a fugitive
from justice.

109
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,194
You're helping Vandal Savage
take over the world.

110
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:30,662
I have a feeling
that our definition

111
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:33,165
of the word "justice"
may differ somewhat.

112
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:35,133
The only difference
between us

113
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:37,869
is my view of the timeline
reaches further

114
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:39,171
and wider than yours.

115
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:41,506
Am I supposed
to be impressed?

116
00:05:43,277 --> 00:05:45,677
In 2175,
less than ten years

117
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,479
from when Savage
conquers the world,

118
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:49,981
the Earth is attacked
by a warlike race

119
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:53,318
of extraterrestrials
from the planet Thanagar.

120
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:58,357
Without Savage to unite
the world under a singular rule,

121
00:05:58,359 --> 00:06:00,659
this is what becomes
of the world.

122
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:02,694
This is the work of Savage.

123
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,129
No.

124
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:06,398
This is what will happen
to Earth

125
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,667
if Savage is not there
to lead it.

126
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:12,003
Without him,
all human life is extinguished.

127
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:15,073
Even this realm falls
to the Thanagarians.

128
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:16,408
Are you impressed now?

129
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,577
No.

130
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:21,346
You are as mad
as your friend vandal

131
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:25,984
if you think that he
is the world's only hope.

132
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:29,354
We've examined the timeline.
There is no other hope.

133
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:32,524
I don't expect you
to take my word for it.

134
00:06:32,526 --> 00:06:35,193
That's why there's something
else I have to show you.

135
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:52,210
How did you even know
that was down there?

136
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:54,913
When Rip first recruited us,
I made it my business

137
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,082
to case every square inch
of this tub

138
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:59,084
in the event there was
something worth stealing.

139
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:01,686
There wasn't.
Let's get out of here.

140
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:03,455
Wait, what about the team?

141
00:07:03,457 --> 00:07:04,790
There's nothing more
we can do for them.

142
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:06,425
You're just gonna leave Mick?

143
00:07:06,427 --> 00:07:09,861
If the Time Masters are half
as twisted as Mick said,

144
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:12,264
there's an excellent chance
Mick is no longer Mick.

145
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:13,932
Now why aren't we flying yet?

146
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,867
Because I'm not
going anywhere.

147
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:18,203
And even if we wanted to,
we're in a hangar

148
00:07:18,205 --> 00:07:20,806
surrounded by an entire armada
of timeships.

149
00:07:20,808 --> 00:07:22,941
It's the Waverider.
We've got guns.

150
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,409
We can blast our way out.

151
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:26,244
This isn't
"Bonnie and Clyde".

152
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:28,914
And I'm not going anywhere
without the rest of the team.

153
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:33,785
Maybe I didn't
make myself clear.

154
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,654
Don't do that.

155
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:38,290
Don't act like you're that same
cold-hearted bastard

156
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:39,658
that I first met.

157
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,560
I remember Russia.

158
00:07:41,562 --> 00:07:43,762
And you were the one
who told me not to kill Stein.

159
00:07:43,764 --> 00:07:45,096
Yeah, because you seem
to have a problem

160
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:46,932
with being a killer.

161
00:07:46,934 --> 00:07:51,336
I, however, don't.

162
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:54,406
Prove it.

163
00:07:54,408 --> 00:07:55,807
Shoot me.

164
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,195
- Hello?
<i>- Hello, Ms. Lance.</i>

165
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:18,997
Gideon, you're alive.

166
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:21,633
<i>If be being "alive" you mean
that my operating system</i>

167
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:23,268
<i>is intact, yes,</i>

168
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,330
<i>I was able to upload
into the latency core</i>

169
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:26,769
<i>to avoid being wiped out
when the Time Masters...</i>

170
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:27,973
We can share
war stories later.

171
00:08:27,975 --> 00:08:29,175
Where the rest of the team?

172
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:31,209
<i>They're in cell block 4587,</i>

173
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:34,045
<i>and they, too, are alive...
For the moment.</i>

174
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,314
What do you mean
"for the moment"?

175
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:46,458
Oh, you're awake.

176
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:49,794
Oh, I wouldn't bother.

177
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:54,699
Those straps are forged
from Tiberian steel.

178
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,801
This is a timeship.

179
00:08:56,803 --> 00:08:58,770
A little gift
from my friends.

180
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:06,411
Oh, Prince Khufu
is with us as well.

181
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:09,481
He's being held in stasis
down at the cargo hold.

182
00:09:09,483 --> 00:09:11,883
And where are you taking us?

183
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:14,986
To an appointment
that I have.

184
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:16,955
With destiny.

185
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:23,028
You should be familiar
with this procedure, Chronos.

186
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,063
The name's Mick.

187
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:28,500
Though we've made
some refinements.

188
00:09:28,502 --> 00:09:30,101
Clearly, your conditioning
was not as thorough

189
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:31,703
as it should have been.

190
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:35,006
For a Time Master,
you sure waste a lot of it.

191
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:37,609
Even with only
a partial induction,

192
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:40,345
you were the greatest
of our hunters, Chronos.

193
00:09:40,347 --> 00:09:42,213
After we're finished,

194
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:45,116
temporal criminals
and time pirates alike

195
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:47,619
will quake at the sound
of your bootsteps.

196
00:09:47,621 --> 00:09:51,356
Mm, well, for your sake,
you better hope that plan works.

197
00:09:51,358 --> 00:09:55,260
'Cause if it doesn't, that
boot's gonna crush your skull.

198
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:17,616
- What is this place?
- Our holy of holies.

199
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:19,651
The Oculus Viewing Chamber,

200
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:24,389
our most powerful window
into past, present, and future.

201
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:27,759
The source of all
our information on the timeline.

202
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:29,427
Why did I now know
about this?

203
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:30,762
No Captain does.

204
00:10:30,764 --> 00:10:32,831
The Oculus' existence
is known

205
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,299
only to the high council,

206
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:36,735
including its greatest secret:

207
00:10:36,737 --> 00:10:40,071
The Oculus not only gives us
a window into time,

208
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:43,942
but the ability to shape it
as we see fit.

209
00:10:43,944 --> 00:10:46,311
We've been helping Vandal Savage
consolidate his power

210
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:48,580
by giving him access
to time travel.

211
00:10:48,582 --> 00:10:50,248
But you've been
helping him too.

212
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:54,019
From the moment we realized only
Savage could save the world,

213
00:10:54,021 --> 00:10:57,188
we've been using the Oculus
to manipulate you.

214
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,624
- That's impossible.
- Think about it.

215
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:01,960
Thanks to your efforts,
Vandal Savage was not in prison

216
00:11:01,962 --> 00:11:04,963
for the sale of a nuclear weapon
in 1975.

217
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:07,198
You prevented the Soviet Union

218
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,335
from winning
the cold war in 1986.

219
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:15,273
Carter hall's death provided
Savage's closest Lieutenants

220
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:17,709
preternaturally long lives.

221
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:19,611
You and your team
have been moving

222
00:11:19,613 --> 00:11:20,845
through the course of time.

223
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:23,381
We've merely redirected it,
and you,

224
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:26,418
to the outcomes
history requires.

225
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:31,690
Look, see for yourself.

226
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:51,635
You're looking into the past.

227
00:11:51,645 --> 00:11:54,905
You see that everything
I've told you is true.

228
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:56,381
This isn't only the past.

229
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:57,883
You can also see the future.

230
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:00,384
Not possible future.

231
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:02,220
Not a prediction.

232
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:05,256
You are looking at events
as they will happen.

233
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:07,858
What about choice?
What about free will?

234
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:10,361
Illusions.
The only place in the universe

235
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:13,531
free will exists is here
at the vanishing point.

236
00:12:21,508 --> 00:12:23,441
No!

237
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:28,046
No matter what you do,
it will happen.

238
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:30,615
And there is nothing
you can do to stop it.

239
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:31,683
No, I acted without
your consent.

240
00:12:31,685 --> 00:12:33,384
In... in defiance of your orders.

241
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:37,922
Everything I've done
has been to save my family.

242
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:40,458
No one controls me!

243
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:44,462
We counted on that,
your anger, on you going rogue.

244
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:47,065
We needed something
to spur you on,

245
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:49,367
to give you purpose.

246
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:51,803
That's why we ordered...

247
00:12:51,805 --> 00:12:55,140
Savage to kill your family.

248
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,490
Rip?

249
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:14,492
Oh, my god,
they've tortured him.

250
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:26,738
What did they do to you?

251
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,174
They showed me the truth.

252
00:13:29,176 --> 00:13:32,610
Druce showed me something
called the Oculus.

253
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:34,779
They've been controlling
us all.

254
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:37,982
Nothing we've done so far
has been of our own accord.

255
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:40,819
We've been following a script
laid out by the Time Masters.

256
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:43,188
No, that's...
that's not possible.

257
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:45,256
I-I refuse to believe that.

258
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:48,827
Well, you should, Raymond...

259
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:50,695
Because they showed me
your death.

260
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm sorry.

261
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:02,874
You said the team
was in trouble.

262
00:14:02,876 --> 00:14:04,676
What sort of trouble,
exactly?

263
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:06,678
I'm not sure exactly,
but I'm getting something

264
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,213
from our psychic connection.

265
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:11,883
Which means I'm in trouble.
What happens?

266
00:14:11,885 --> 00:14:13,385
Come on, Grey,
you know I can't tell you that.

267
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:15,486
- Says who?
- Says you...

268
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:17,288
- In the future.
- Oh.

269
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,023
And even if I didn't have
to worry about the dangers

270
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:20,291
of giving you future knowledge,

271
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:23,161
we got bigger things
to worry about.

272
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:25,997
Hey, you're drawing
too much power

273
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:27,398
from the Sequestrian manifold.

274
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,000
That's nonsense, Jefferson.

275
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:31,736
Need I remind you who invented
the Sequestrian manifold?

276
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:33,238
Oh, dear god.

277
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,641
- Yeah.
- Well, you were right.

278
00:14:36,643 --> 00:14:38,376
Oh, don't sound
so surprised.

279
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:39,744
Well, it's not often
that an auto mechanic

280
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:41,813
knows more than
a nuclear physicist.

281
00:14:41,815 --> 00:14:45,650
You know, I forgot
how arrogant you were.

282
00:14:45,652 --> 00:14:47,252
"Were"?

283
00:14:47,254 --> 00:14:51,923
Why are you referring to me
in the past tense?

284
00:14:51,925 --> 00:14:54,559
Do you witness my death?

285
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:58,596
Relax, you don't die.

286
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:01,232
Horribly maimed.

287
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:04,234
Why won't you tell me
what happens?

288
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,070
Instead of pestering me
about the future

289
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:08,502
and being
an insufferable know-it-all,

290
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:10,908
why don't you help me
reroute the temporal flow

291
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:12,611
off the secondary buffer

292
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:14,712
instead of just
worrying about yourself?

293
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:16,674
- Hmm?
- All right.

294
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:27,191
I apologize for how painful
the induction process was.

295
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:30,962
Many of your memories
were rooted deep.

296
00:15:30,964 --> 00:15:33,731
It took effort
to pull them out.

297
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:35,300
Tell me...

298
00:15:35,302 --> 00:15:37,402
What is your name?

299
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:42,273
Your name!

300
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,411
Your name?

301
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:55,820
- Your...
- Chronos.

302
00:15:55,822 --> 00:15:58,489
Release him.

303
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:09,233
There is much hunting
to be done.

304
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:12,503
Let us begin with Sara Lance
and Leonard Snart.

305
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:33,024
- This is a bad plan.
- It's Gideon's.

306
00:16:33,026 --> 00:16:35,693
You're not helping
your argument.

307
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:37,328
We need to finish putting
these on the ships,

308
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,330
and get back
to the Waverider.

309
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:48,773
I can't just stand around here
and wait to die.

310
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:51,275
Well, if it's any consolation,
you're not alone.

311
00:16:51,277 --> 00:16:53,177
Oh, you're giving up too?

312
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:56,614
Well, let's just review our
situation, shall we, Raymond?

313
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:59,283
They're turning Mr. Rory
back into Chronos,

314
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:02,220
I... I'm about to have
a nuclear meltdown...

315
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:03,322
and our Captain thinks
our future

316
00:17:03,323 --> 00:17:05,323
is already written for us.

317
00:17:05,325 --> 00:17:06,858
You know what I think?

318
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,893
I think you're both
a couple of quitters.

319
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:10,895
There's no escape
from either these cells

320
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:12,221
or from the future.

321
00:17:12,232 --> 00:17:14,032
<i>Face the facts, Raymond.</i>

322
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:16,134
We're completely
out of allies.

323
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:19,136
You're forgetting
Sarah and Snart.

324
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,172
As long as
they're on the loose,

325
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:23,241
we still have a chance.

326
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:25,510
<i>Just another moment.
I'm almost through.</i>

327
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:27,145
Even if this works,

328
00:17:27,147 --> 00:17:28,913
we're never gonna be able
to fly out off here.

329
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:30,815
Well, that's the beauty
of having a timeship.

330
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:32,650
We don't have to fly
anywhere.

331
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:38,489
Can you stop doing that?

332
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:40,658
Why did you start wearing
that thing, anyways?

333
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,561
It's from the first job
I ever pulled off with Mick.

334
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:45,263
A freeport warehouse.

335
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:48,099
Oh, you do have
a sentimental side.

336
00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:50,568
It's not a keepsake.
It's a reminder.

337
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,769
Of what?

338
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:53,838
That even the best laid plans

339
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,840
can go sideways.

340
00:17:55,842 --> 00:17:58,609
Spent a lot of time
prepping for that heist.

341
00:17:58,611 --> 00:18:00,511
Casing the target.

342
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:04,082
Memorizing shift changes
and delivery schedules,

343
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:05,583
and then surprise!

344
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:08,519
Turns out they'd upgraded
their security system.

345
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:10,221
We had to bolt.

346
00:18:10,223 --> 00:18:13,724
Three weeks of planning
and all I have to show for it...

347
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:17,862
Was a lousy pinky ring.
So sad.

348
00:18:17,864 --> 00:18:20,864
Considering I'm about
to trade my life for nothing,

349
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:23,267
I think I came out ahead.

350
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:26,269
<i>The time drive
is back online.</i>

351
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:28,272
Strap in.

352
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:40,449
Sir, the Waverider
just time-jumped.

353
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,753
Order all available
timeships to pursue.

354
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:43,885
Sir, the Captains
aren't prepared for...

355
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:45,450
All of them!

356
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,914
- Godfrey, what's happening?
<i>- I'm sorry, Captain.</i>

357
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,350

Your friends
have time-jumped away.

367
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:42,480
We've lost them.

368
00:19:42,482 --> 00:19:44,849
And I've lost any reason
to keep you alive.

369
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:46,651
Hold on, let's just talk
about this a moment.

370
00:19:46,653 --> 00:19:48,319
Time master Druce.

371
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:50,451
Kill them all.

372
00:19:50,456 --> 00:19:53,056
- Starting with him.
- Yes, sir.

373
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:56,359
But we've calculated
when the Waverider is headed.

374
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:57,628
Past or future?

375
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,730
The present.

376
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:14,412
Somebody order up a rescue?

377
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:17,048
Mr. Snart,
your timing is impeccable.

378
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,349
Or not.

379
00:20:23,923 --> 00:20:26,924
Put the gun down, Mick.

380
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,862
Chronos, fire.

381
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:40,838
Sure thing.

382
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:50,848
If I recall,
I made you a certain promise.

383
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:56,754
No, I beg of you.

384
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:59,757
No!

385
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:09,066
Where's everyone else?

386
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:10,067
Uh, Mr. Snart is helping
the Professor

387
00:21:10,069 --> 00:21:11,736
get situated in the medbay.

388
00:21:11,738 --> 00:21:14,071
He's not doing so how
without his nuclear super-half.

389
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:16,440
Get me out of this
stupid robot suit.

390
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:18,943
First get us the hell
out of here... Gideon?

391
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:21,279
<i>I'm here, Captain,
and if I could take a moment</i>

392
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:23,381
<i>to add how wonderful it feels
to be back together.</i>

393
00:21:23,383 --> 00:21:25,082
I have missed you too.

394
00:21:25,084 --> 00:21:26,717
<i>Now that we've had
our reunion,</i>

395
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:28,853
<i>I should mention
we have a slight problem.</i>

396
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,324
Uh, the Time Masters
are locking onto us

397
00:21:33,326 --> 00:21:34,425
with a tractor beam.

398
00:21:34,427 --> 00:21:35,893
Punch it, Gideon.

399
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:37,261
Sorry, your job.

400
00:21:37,263 --> 00:21:39,096
Ms. Lance,
stay right where you are.

401
00:21:39,098 --> 00:21:40,464
You've proven yourself quite
adept at piloting this ship.

402
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:42,066
About the tractor beam...

403
00:21:42,068 --> 00:21:43,634
Dr. Palmer is going to help me
remotely disable it.

404
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:45,136
<i>I've already established
an uplink</i>

405
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:46,771
<i>to the omnimatrix mainframe,
Captain.</i>

406
00:21:46,773 --> 00:21:48,272
The Time Masters are evil,
but they're not dumb.

407
00:21:48,274 --> 00:21:49,607
There's no way
they're gonna let Gideon

408
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:51,309
override the tractor beam
remotely.

409
00:21:57,516 --> 00:21:58,683
Whatever you're gonna do,
you better do it now.

410
00:21:58,685 --> 00:22:00,451
- They've locked on.
- Wait.

411
00:22:00,453 --> 00:22:02,019
What if we convince the system
that the override command

412
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:04,989
- is coming from somewhere else?
- Or someone else.

413
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:06,824
Someone they trust.

414
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:09,794
Just need to borrow...
Chronos' operating system.

415
00:22:09,796 --> 00:22:12,196
<i>I'm "hotswapping" Mr. Rory's
hard drive as we speak.</i>

416
00:22:13,633 --> 00:22:15,993
Whatever you're doing,
do it faster.

417
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:18,362
And... done.

418
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:23,901
Now, Sara!

419
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:37,221
Well, I suppose it's time
to say good-bye.

420
00:22:37,223 --> 00:22:39,457
At least for now.

421
00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:41,625
Oh, one more thing,
don't forget to initiate the...

422
00:22:41,627 --> 00:22:44,628
the quantum attenuator once I
lock on to the vanishing point.

423
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,997
Right.

424
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:49,533
I suppose it's also time
to apologize

425
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:52,336
for being an
"insufferable know-it-all".

426
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:55,573
You know,
it used to drive me crazy,

427
00:22:55,575 --> 00:22:56,707
but I understand it's just
your way

428
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,876
of trying to look out for me.

429
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:01,408
Oh, by the way,
I'm going to be real pissed

430
00:23:01,414 --> 00:23:03,314
about this whole
roofie thing,

431
00:23:03,316 --> 00:23:05,876
- but I do get over it.
- Roofie thing?

432
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:10,015
- I-I would never dream...
- Yeah, you do...

433
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:12,722
But it's okay.

434
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:17,559
It's actually
the best decision I never made.

435
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:20,331
The future...

436
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:22,166
You want to know
what happens?

437
00:23:22,168 --> 00:23:23,401
No, no,
it's... it's all right.

438
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:25,770
I-I know enough.

439
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,373
The young man in front of me
is proof

440
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:32,243
that something must have
gone right on this adventure.

441
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:37,081
- So long, Martin.
- So long, Jefferson.

442
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,622
Professor's in the medbay.

443
00:23:44,624 --> 00:23:47,024
Promises not to blow up
while he's on board,

444
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:48,793
which I thought was considerate.

445
00:23:48,795 --> 00:23:50,361
Yeah, the Professor's
condition is the least

446
00:23:50,363 --> 00:23:52,029
of our worries, I'm afraid.

447
00:23:52,031 --> 00:23:54,198
Yeah, much to my chagrin,

448
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,866
it turns out everything
we've done,

449
00:23:55,868 --> 00:23:57,301
maybe even our whole lives,

450
00:23:57,303 --> 00:23:59,703
has been determined
by the Time Masters.

451
00:23:59,705 --> 00:24:01,305
- What?
- The Time Masters have

452
00:24:01,307 --> 00:24:03,908
this thing called the Oculus,
which allows them

453
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:06,110
not only to gaze
into the future,

454
00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:08,646
but to engineer it.

455
00:24:08,648 --> 00:24:11,048
A future where I'm dead,
apparently.

456
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,616
And why would
they want you dead?

457
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:15,085
Have you ever listened
to what comes out of his mouth?

458
00:24:15,087 --> 00:24:16,821
Now, in my opinion,
Dr. Palmer's death

459
00:24:16,823 --> 00:24:18,255
is not part of their plan.

460
00:24:18,257 --> 00:24:21,492
No, that's not reassuring.
Ow!

461
00:24:21,494 --> 00:24:24,094
You saying the Time Masters
wanted me to do that?

462
00:24:24,096 --> 00:24:26,230
What I'm saying is that
they've been engineering

463
00:24:26,232 --> 00:24:28,966
our lives to move
in very specific directions.

464
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:32,002
And we are playing out
that script even now.

465
00:24:32,004 --> 00:24:34,104
So we can go to 2016,

466
00:24:34,106 --> 00:24:35,473
but that might be
what the Time Masters want.

467
00:24:35,475 --> 00:24:37,641
Or we can go get
Kendra and Carter...

468
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:39,677
which could also be
what they want.

469
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,947
Then we need to do
what they don't want.

470
00:24:42,949 --> 00:24:45,115
If the Oculus is what
they're using to control us,

471
00:24:45,117 --> 00:24:47,184
then we need to destroy it.

472
00:24:47,186 --> 00:24:49,119
But how do we do that if
the time bastards

473
00:24:49,121 --> 00:24:50,921
are pulling our strings?

474
00:24:50,923 --> 00:24:52,790
Well, Druce told me
that the Oculus' ability

475
00:24:52,792 --> 00:24:55,459
to control our actions doesn't
work in the vanishing point,

476
00:24:55,461 --> 00:24:57,127
most likely because
the vanishing point itself

477
00:24:57,129 --> 00:24:58,329
exists outside of time.

478
00:24:58,331 --> 00:25:00,531
Explains why we were able
to escape.

479
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:05,263
And why we might actually have
a shot at destroying this thing.

480
00:25:05,271 --> 00:25:08,005
- I'm with Ray.
- Ow.

481
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:09,773
If I'm gonna be
someone's puppet,

482
00:25:09,775 --> 00:25:12,275
I'm gonna be the one who cuts
his own bloody strings.

483
00:25:12,278 --> 00:25:14,178
And I like blowing stuff up.

484
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,814
We set out on this mission to
stop Savage and save the world.

485
00:25:16,816 --> 00:25:19,884
To become legends
and change our fates.

486
00:25:19,886 --> 00:25:21,285
That mission hasn't changed.

487
00:25:21,287 --> 00:25:25,289
This is madness.

488
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:27,258
I like it.

489
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:34,965
Gideon, plot a course
to the Oculus wellspring.

490
00:25:34,967 --> 00:25:36,834
Team...

491
00:25:36,836 --> 00:25:39,937
I think it's about time
we seized our destinies back.

492
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:48,979
Mmm.

493
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:54,251
If I'm gonna die,
no sense watching my diet.

494
00:25:54,253 --> 00:25:55,653
The Time Masters
have been known

495
00:25:55,655 --> 00:25:57,588
to make mistakes, you know?

496
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:01,559
But what if those mistakes
were all part of their plan?

497
00:26:01,561 --> 00:26:02,826
Actually, I gotta stop
thinking about it.

498
00:26:02,828 --> 00:26:04,728
The temporal implications
are infinite.

499
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:07,698
That's why I don't think.

500
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,534
- Not bad, right?
- Good.

501
00:26:10,536 --> 00:26:13,003
- So how'd you do it?
- Do what?

502
00:26:13,005 --> 00:26:15,172
How did you <i>not</i>
<i>get turned into Chronos?</i>

503
00:26:15,174 --> 00:26:18,075
You said the only way you held
onto yourself the first time

504
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:20,411
was by focusing on
your hate.

505
00:26:20,413 --> 00:26:22,947
What did I focus on
this time?

506
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:26,750
The team.

507
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:30,120
And how much
you cared for us?

508
00:26:30,122 --> 00:26:32,690
I thought about how royally
screwed you'd be without me.

509
00:26:32,692 --> 00:26:34,358
My point being,

510
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:38,028
if I can survive
not being turned into Chronos,

511
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:41,231
you can survive anything
they throw at you.

512
00:26:41,233 --> 00:26:43,067
Thanks.
I'll keep it in mind.

513
00:26:43,069 --> 00:26:45,202
Well, you better

514
00:26:45,204 --> 00:26:48,973
because if you tell the team
I actually care,

515
00:26:48,975 --> 00:26:50,975
I'll shave your head.

516
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:56,213
Man, this is good.

517
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:09,960
Not in the mood.

518
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:13,831
I was gonna apologize
for pulling a gun on you,

519
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:16,800
but apparently
I was just following a script.

520
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:20,104
Doesn't make you
any less of a jerk.

521
00:27:20,106 --> 00:27:21,639
Guilty.

522
00:27:21,641 --> 00:27:24,475
So what do we think
of Rip's plan?

523
00:27:24,477 --> 00:27:26,810
Does it matter?

524
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:28,746
Apparently everything
we're going to do

525
00:27:28,748 --> 00:27:31,649
has already been predetermined
by Rip's former bosses.

526
00:27:31,651 --> 00:27:35,119
It's funny, I've always
prided myself on being the guy

527
00:27:35,121 --> 00:27:36,954
who doesn't play
by the rules.

528
00:27:36,956 --> 00:27:41,592
Come to find out,
I'm the one being played.

529
00:27:41,594 --> 00:27:43,193
I don't know.

530
00:27:43,195 --> 00:27:45,929
I still feel responsible
for everything I've done.

531
00:27:45,931 --> 00:27:48,365
And it still keeps me up
at night.

532
00:27:48,367 --> 00:27:52,269
It's the things I didn't do
that keep me up at night.

533
00:27:52,271 --> 00:27:54,805
- What's that?
- Oh, I don't know.

534
00:27:54,807 --> 00:27:58,442
Maybe it's being on this ship
traveling through time

535
00:27:58,444 --> 00:28:01,979
I started to wonder what
the future might hold for me...

536
00:28:01,981 --> 00:28:04,281
And you...

537
00:28:04,283 --> 00:28:08,052
And me and you.

538
00:28:08,054 --> 00:28:11,155
You want to steal a kiss
from me, Leonard?

539
00:28:11,157 --> 00:28:13,557
You better be one hell
of a thief.

540
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:23,467
How you feeling, Martin?

541
00:28:23,469 --> 00:28:25,703
Well, I'm dying.

542
00:28:25,705 --> 00:28:29,406
I'm also sure that you're dying
and so are all the others.

543
00:28:29,408 --> 00:28:33,177
I'm just a little
ahead of you.

544
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:36,213
Normally I'd be quite concerned,
but the truth is

545
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:39,316
discovering one's life
has already been predetermined

546
00:28:39,318 --> 00:28:42,920
is ironically liberating.

547
00:28:42,922 --> 00:28:45,823
I... I've already run through
everything we know

548
00:28:45,825 --> 00:28:49,860
about the Oculus,
and with the help of a few

549
00:28:49,862 --> 00:28:51,929
"back of the envelope"
physics calculations,

550
00:28:51,931 --> 00:28:54,264
I'm determined
that we have a chance.

551
00:28:54,266 --> 00:28:57,568
Infinitesimal as that may be.

552
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:00,237
<i>Captain, we've arrived
at the Oculus wellspring</i>

553
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:02,506
<i>on the far side
of the vanishing point.</i>

554
00:29:11,383 --> 00:29:13,584
Based on Captain Hunter's
description,

555
00:29:13,586 --> 00:29:16,620
the Oculus is a massive
temporal computer,

556
00:29:16,622 --> 00:29:19,690
most likely powered
by a scaled-down supernova

557
00:29:19,692 --> 00:29:21,925
contained at the bottom
of the wellspring.

558
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:23,927
Why aren't any of you
more excited by this?

559
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:25,629
We're excited
to blow it up.

560
00:29:25,631 --> 00:29:28,632
Dr. Palmer will deactivate
the core contained supernova,

561
00:29:28,634 --> 00:29:31,969
which should create
an anomalistic event.

562
00:29:31,971 --> 00:29:34,037
A very big explosion.

563
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:35,139
Sounds like a plan.

564
00:30:04,235 --> 00:30:06,069
Hello again, Rip.

565
00:30:06,071 --> 00:30:07,404
Right on schedule.

566
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:17,114
Uh, I think we've walked
into a trap.

567
00:30:17,116 --> 00:30:20,316
No, it's destiny.

568
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,300
I must say you've all
played your parts well.

569
00:30:29,462 --> 00:30:31,022
As with everything else
you've done,

570
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:33,130
I'm afraid it was all
for nothing.

571
00:30:33,132 --> 00:30:35,292
All your posturing.

572
00:30:35,301 --> 00:30:37,935
All your claims about doing
what's best for the timeline,

573
00:30:37,937 --> 00:30:39,703
about protecting history,

574
00:30:39,705 --> 00:30:42,272
and it all comes down
to cold blooded murder.

575
00:30:42,274 --> 00:30:45,209
The difference between
murder and execution

576
00:30:45,211 --> 00:30:47,845
is only a matter of authority.

577
00:30:47,847 --> 00:30:50,547
I have it.
You don't.

578
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:51,609
Kill them.

579
00:31:22,313 --> 00:31:24,013
<i>Returning the jumpship
to the Waverider.</i>

580
00:31:24,014 --> 00:31:26,364
- <i>Good luck, Mr. Jackson.</i>
- Hope I'm not too late.

581
00:31:26,418 --> 00:31:29,253
No, Jefferson,
you're right on time.

582
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:34,424
- How did you...
- What?

583
00:31:34,426 --> 00:31:35,826
You thought you were
the only one

584
00:31:35,828 --> 00:31:37,494
who knew a thing or two
about time travel?

585
00:31:37,496 --> 00:31:39,596
Good work.
We need to get to the Oculus

586
00:31:39,598 --> 00:31:42,599
before reinforcements arrive.

587
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,197
Take about two minutes
to figure out

588
00:32:14,199 --> 00:32:16,033
how to self-destruct
this thing.

589
00:32:16,035 --> 00:32:18,201
We'll buy you some time.
You lot guard the entrance.

590
00:32:18,203 --> 00:32:20,137
Mr. Rory, you're with me.

591
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:35,819
Now if you'd excuse me,
I won't be long.

592
00:32:35,821 --> 00:32:40,223
Savage...
Hath-set!

593
00:32:40,225 --> 00:32:43,293
Please.

594
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:44,728
Don't do this.

595
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:46,596
Don't kill Rip's family.

596
00:32:46,598 --> 00:32:51,301
In a cosmic sense,
it's already done.

597
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:54,571
No!
Savage!

598
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:14,191
- Hurry up, haircut.
- How much longer?

599
00:33:14,193 --> 00:33:16,593
Well, just about to reverse
the polarity matrix.

600
00:33:16,595 --> 00:33:18,428
Once I do that,
I say we have about two minutes

601
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:19,663
before this whole place
goes boom.

602
00:33:19,665 --> 00:33:20,831
How big of a boom?

603
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:21,865
On a scale from one to ten...

604
00:33:21,867 --> 00:33:23,500
A googolplex.

605
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:32,676
- What are you doing?
- I can't work

606
00:33:32,678 --> 00:33:34,544
with all this gear on.
You can't.

607
00:33:34,546 --> 00:33:36,113
- A programmer needs his hands.
- Ray...

608
00:33:36,115 --> 00:33:38,281
- I got this, don't worry.
- No, you don't.

609
00:33:38,283 --> 00:33:41,952
This is what I saw.
This is what Druce showed me.

610
00:33:41,954 --> 00:33:46,156
This is how you die.

611
00:33:46,158 --> 00:33:47,724
It's okay.

612
00:33:47,726 --> 00:33:49,860
All my life I've wanted to
make a difference.

613
00:33:49,862 --> 00:33:51,061
Creating a future for you guys

614
00:33:51,063 --> 00:33:53,130
without the Time Masters
influence,

615
00:33:53,132 --> 00:33:54,664
that counts.

616
00:33:58,737 --> 00:34:00,837
That said,
I'm in no rush to die,

617
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:02,472
so keep 'em off me, okay?

618
00:34:02,474 --> 00:34:03,807
We got you.

619
00:34:03,809 --> 00:34:06,409
Keep firing!

620
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:24,094
Ahh!

621
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:30,901
I'm not doing this
'cause I like you.

622
00:34:30,903 --> 00:34:33,103
Yes, I know.

623
00:34:34,873 --> 00:34:38,375
All right.
Almost done.

624
00:34:38,377 --> 00:34:42,279
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh?

625
00:34:42,281 --> 00:34:45,515
There seems to be a failsafe
to prevent tampering,

626
00:34:45,517 --> 00:34:48,085
which probably includes
trying to blow this thing up.

627
00:34:48,087 --> 00:34:49,619
English, haircut.

628
00:34:49,621 --> 00:34:51,354
I have to maintain contact
with the failsafe

629
00:34:51,356 --> 00:34:54,424
it order to destroy
the Oculus.

630
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:56,293
Not that much English.

631
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:01,965
Ahh!

632
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,403
Get back to the ship.

633
00:35:06,405 --> 00:35:09,305
We are not leaving
without you.

634
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:15,343
You've already seen the
future. I'm dead already.

635
00:35:15,547 --> 00:35:17,347
You're right.

636
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:24,054
- Mick...
- I got this.

637
00:35:24,056 --> 00:35:25,989
I want revenge
on those bastards.

638
00:35:25,991 --> 00:35:27,390
Now get outta here.

639
00:35:42,006 --> 00:35:45,308
Your mother was brave...

640
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:47,277
Just as your father
was foolish.

641
00:35:47,279 --> 00:35:49,179
Which are you?

642
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:54,417
We're leaving.

643
00:35:57,088 --> 00:35:58,588
Where's Raymond and Mick?

644
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:01,024
Ray is in my pocket
and Mick has elected to stay.

645
00:36:01,026 --> 00:36:02,659
- Why?
- Someone needs to be present

646
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:05,861
to destroy the Oculus.
Mick has elected himself.

647
00:36:05,864 --> 00:36:07,924
No, no, no, no, no, you can't.
There isn't ti...

648
00:36:07,933 --> 00:36:09,699
We gotta go!

649
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:21,912
- Mick.
- Get outta here.

650
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:25,782
Not without you, Mick.

651
00:36:25,784 --> 00:36:28,451
Pretty boy said I gotta hold
this stick for the ship to blow.

652
00:36:28,453 --> 00:36:32,122
So I'm holding this stick.
Now leave!

653
00:36:32,124 --> 00:36:35,725
My old friend,
please forgive me.

654
00:36:35,727 --> 00:36:38,461
For what?

655
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:43,700
- Get him outta here.
- No.

656
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:46,203
Just do it.

657
00:37:03,422 --> 00:37:05,855
You take after your mother,
huh?

658
00:37:10,996 --> 00:37:13,396
Or not.

659
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:17,734
No, shut it down.

660
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:19,869
Shut it down!

661
00:37:19,871 --> 00:37:22,772
There are no strings on me.

662
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:03,713
He traded his life
for ours.

663
00:38:03,715 --> 00:38:05,882
He was a hero.

664
00:38:05,884 --> 00:38:08,551
Which I'm pretty sure is
the last thing

665
00:38:08,553 --> 00:38:12,222
he wanted to be
remembered as.

666
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:14,190
But that's what he was.

667
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:28,271
- Gideon?
<i>- Yes, Captain?</i>

668
00:38:28,273 --> 00:38:31,741
Would you please review
the timeline for me?

669
00:38:31,743 --> 00:38:33,510
<i>There is no timeline data</i>

670
00:38:33,512 --> 00:38:36,646
<i>due to the destruction
of the Oculus.</i>

671
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:39,649
We're sailing
without a map.

672
00:38:42,453 --> 00:38:47,123
Uh, would you please...

673
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:50,527
Review news accounts
from 2166 then.

674
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:57,300
You know what I need
to find out.

675
00:38:57,302 --> 00:39:00,103
<i>I'm sorry, Captain.</i>

676
00:39:00,105 --> 00:39:03,273
<i>News accounts from 2166
confirm that Vandal Savage</i>

677
00:39:03,275 --> 00:39:07,344
<i>has already succeeded in
murdering Miranda and Jonas.</i>

678
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:23,727
Hey.

679
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:29,032
Get out.
I want to be alone.

680
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:37,240
Gideon has confirmed that
the Oculus has been destroyed.

681
00:39:37,242 --> 00:39:41,077
From here on out,
it's <i>Tabula Rasa.</i>

682
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:43,880
Pretend for a minute
that I don't speak Greek.

683
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:45,882
Latin.

684
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:47,650
Sorry.

685
00:39:47,652 --> 00:39:49,919
From this point forward,

686
00:39:49,921 --> 00:39:52,989
our actions are our own.

687
00:39:52,991 --> 00:39:54,858
We have free will.

688
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,860
That supposed to make me
feel better?

689
00:39:56,862 --> 00:39:58,495
Yes.

690
00:39:58,497 --> 00:40:03,099
It means that Leonard
didn't die for nothing.

691
00:40:03,101 --> 00:40:05,769
He planted that on me
before it happened.

692
00:40:05,771 --> 00:40:09,038
I'm sorry, Mick.

693
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,107
I killed Declan,
Druce is dead.

694
00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:13,276
The Time Masters have nothing
now that their ship

695
00:40:13,278 --> 00:40:14,944
was completely destroyed.

696
00:40:14,946 --> 00:40:21,518
Yet I still feel a need
to kill someone for Snart.

697
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:26,856
Savage still has
Carter and Kendra.

698
00:40:26,858 --> 00:40:28,925
He'll do nicely.

699
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,302
Oh, don't weep for the dead,
Chay-Ara.

700
00:40:39,304 --> 00:40:40,703
They're mortal.

701
00:40:40,705 --> 00:40:43,072
They're beneath us.

702
00:40:43,074 --> 00:40:45,041
I want to speak
with Time Master Druce.

703
00:40:45,043 --> 00:40:48,411
<i>- Mr. Savage.
- I wish to speak with Druce.</i>

704
00:40:48,413 --> 00:40:51,948
<i>Time master Druce is dead.</i>

705
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,650
Hunter.

706
00:40:53,652 --> 00:40:56,886
<i>We've lost the ability
to manipulate time.</i>

707
00:40:56,888 --> 00:40:59,289
And how is that
of concern to me?

708
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:01,558
<i>You are beyond our aid,
Mr. Savage.</i>

709
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,626
<i>We cannot help you
any longer.</i>

710
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:05,495
And what of the threat
of the Thanagarians?

711
00:41:05,497 --> 00:41:08,665
<i>Without the Oculus,
time is unmoored.</i>

712
00:41:08,667 --> 00:41:12,168
<i>Events will no longer unfold
as we've foreseen.</i>

713
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:14,604
<i>Or as we've engineered.</i>

714
00:41:14,606 --> 00:41:17,173
Terminate transmission.

715
00:41:20,445 --> 00:41:24,681
It looks like your friends
have cut you loose.

716
00:41:24,683 --> 00:41:26,816
How long do you think
you can hold onto power

717
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:29,519
with out the Time Masters
backing you?

718
00:41:29,521 --> 00:41:31,421
Not long, I'm afraid,

719
00:41:31,423 --> 00:41:34,157
but they have provided me
with a timeship.

720
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:38,461
I no longer need to rule
the world, Chay-Ara.

721
00:41:38,463 --> 00:41:43,032
I now have the ability
to change it.

722
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:17,600
Greg, move your head.
