I flagged a large wire transfer you made.

158

When I mentioned it to Walter,
he told me he'd talk to you about it.

You paid a substantial

You had an affair with Malcolm Merlyn.

One year before Thea was born.

Merlyn is Thea's father.

such a high appraisal of your capabilities.

Because Thea can never find out
about Merlyn.

470
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:13,612
And she can never know
the truth about us.

471
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:18,617
Which is that as of right now,
we have no relationship.

472
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:24,122
I will keep up appearances
for Thea's sake...

473
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:27,250
...publicly I will support your campaign.

474
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:31,254
But privately...

475
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:34,924
...you and I are done.

476
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,635
Oliver.

477
00:35:37,052 --> 00:35:38,553
Oliver.

478
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:44,100
Oliver!

479
00:35:46,603 --> 00:35:48,480
DINAH:
I knew you were alive.

480
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:50,982
I felt it in my bones.

481
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:53,693
I never stopped looking for you.

482
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,447
I know you have a lot of questions.

483
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,115
Nope.

484
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:01,368
How could you not have any questions?

485
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:05,705
Because I already know
all of the answers to them.

486
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:10,502
How could you still be alive?
Where have you been all this time?

487
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,879
Why didn't you call us?

488
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:16,007
And the answer to all of them...

489
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:20,720
...is because it's Sara.

490
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:24,015
-Baby, don't to this.
-I swear to God, if you say one more word...

491
00:36:24,224 --> 00:36:27,143
Laurel, look, I know you're angry.

492
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:30,271
And you have every right to be.

493
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:34,234
Please don't take this out on Dad.
If you need someone to blame, you blame me.

494
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,277
I do blame you, Sara.

495
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:41,032
Every single thing that's gone wrong
in our lives is your fault.

496
00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:45,620
You got on that stupid boat
with my boyfriend.

497
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:48,998
You didn't call us
to tell us that you were still alive...

498
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,918
...even though it would have saved
Mom and Dad's marriage.

499
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:56,047
And you brought some crazy assassin
into Starling City who nearly killed Mom...

500
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:57,966
...and who poisoned me.

501
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:00,969
You.

502
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:04,305
You stole my whole life
away from me.

503
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:08,977
-Now, get out.
-Laurel.

504
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:11,396
Get out.

505
00:37:25,702 --> 00:37:28,246
-I'm sorry.
-I said get out!

506
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:31,249
Now what?

507
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:41,384
Please, come in.

508
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:49,142
Tell me Oliver's okay.

509
00:37:50,477 --> 00:37:52,061
Tell me everything's okay.

510
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,980
I wish I could.

511
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:57,400
Moira, I'm so sorry about Robert.
About Oliver.

512
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:59,194
I really am.

513
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,029
Is...

514
00:38:01,488 --> 00:38:03,907
I need to tell you both something.

515
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:06,159
What is it?

516
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:15,418
Robert and Oliver
weren't the only ones lost.

517
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:18,588
Along with the crew...

518
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:23,718
...a friend invited along
by Oliver at the last minute.

519
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,303
Tommy?

520
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:27,263
No.

521
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:32,268
Sara.

522
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:35,814
Your Sara.

523
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:38,233
I'm so sorry, Quentin.

524
00:38:41,611 --> 00:38:43,822
The dockmaster saw her
sneak onboard.

525
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:50,286
MAN [ON TV]: <i>With Moira Queen's
impressive speech earlier today...</i>

526
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:53,665
<i>...some pundits are suggesting
her candidacy may not be so farfetched.</i>

527
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:56,668
<i>While Blood's campaign
has yet to issue a public response...</i>

528
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:58,378
<i>...to Mrs. Queen's announcement...</i>

529
00:38:58,545 --> 00:39:01,047
I warned you not to underestimate
Moira Queen.

530
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:02,882
What you want me to do?

531
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:07,720
<i>Thank you. Thank you, Starling City!</i>

532
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:10,807
Nothing.

533
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:16,145
I'll take care of it.

534
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:33,329
You've been crying.

535
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:35,874
I was happy to know I still could.

536
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:37,834
Are you okay?

537
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:42,171
Laurel wasn't as thrilled
to see me as you thought.

538
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:44,465
Give her time.

539
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,344
I gave her six years.

540
00:39:51,014 --> 00:39:53,349
What exactly are you taking out
on that dummy?

541
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:57,145
My mother...

542
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:03,985
She's not who I thought she was.

543
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:06,154
I guess it's going around.

544
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:10,909
So, what now?

545
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:14,120
I don't know.

546
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:17,916
I don't either.

547
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:21,461
I know one thing.

548
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,838
What's that?

549
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:26,174
I'm home.
