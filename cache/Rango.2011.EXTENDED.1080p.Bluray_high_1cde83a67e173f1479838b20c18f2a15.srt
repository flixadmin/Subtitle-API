00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,849
<i>Rangooo!</i>

3
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:02,020
<i>Rangooo...</i>

4
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,440
<i>Rangoo!</i>

5
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:08,277
<i>Rangooo...</i>

<i>Rangooo...</i>

7
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:16,910
We are gathered here today
to immortalize in song.

8
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:20,998
The life and untimely
death of a great legend.

9
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:26,795
So sit back, relax, and enjoy your low
calorie popcorn and assorted confections.

10
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:31,925
While we tell you the strange
and bewildering tale of a hero.

11
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:35,846
Who has yet to enter
his own story.

12
00:01:40,184 --> 00:01:49,484
Hmmm. Hmmmaoh. Muh.
Mmmuh! Mmmmuh! Hmmmuh!

13
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,905
Crunchy-creamy-coky-candle-cupcake.

14
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:56,825
Okay, everybody!
Let's take it from the top.

15
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,787
The stage is set. The night
moist with apprehension.

16
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:05,125
Alone in her chamber, the princess
prepares to take her own life.

17
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:09,713
It is far better to nourish
worms than to live without love!

18
00:02:09,922 --> 00:02:11,798
She reaches for
the poison chalice.

19
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:14,968
Meanwhile, the wicked Malvolio
plots his ascension to the throne.

20
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:18,263
While her aging father
lies gravely ill.

21
00:02:18,514 --> 00:02:20,974
Yes, I'm gravely ill...

22
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:22,935
Hark, who goes there?

23
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:26,230
It is I!
The much anticipated hero.

24
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:29,233
Returning to rescue
his emotionally unstable maiden.

25
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:34,196
Unhand her you jailers of virtue or
taste the bitter sting of my vengeance!

26
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:38,492
The sting of my... The...

27
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:43,372
Doctor Marx? Doctor Marx,
I'm not getting anything from you!

28
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:47,751
People, we've talked about this!
Acting is reacting.

29
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,045
Victor, you were wooden!
There, I said it.

30
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,756
Mister Tims, you were good.

31
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:55,634
Perhaps a little too good!

32
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:59,763
What's that, Victor?
My character's undefined? That's absurd!

33
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:04,560
I know who I am. I'm thee... I'm the guy!
The protagonist, the hero!

34
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:07,020
Every story needs a hero!
I mean...

35
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:09,231
Who else is better
qualified to bask

36
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,526
in the adulation of his
numerous companions!

37
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:37,426
<i>The stage is waiting.
The audience thirsts for adventure.</i>

38
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:41,054
<i>Who am I?</i>

39
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:43,599
<i>I could be anyone!</i>

40
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:47,519
I... I could be the sea captain
returning from a mighty voyage,

41
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:50,606
to reclaim his mechanical arm!

42
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:56,195
Or the rogue anthropologist,
battling pythons down in the congo!

43
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,322
Down, chunga!

44
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:02,117
And if you desire romance,
I will become the

45
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:05,954
greatest lover the
world has ever known!

46
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:09,666
Hola!

47
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:16,715
I couldn't help but notice
you noticing me noticing you.

48
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:20,511
You know the womens find me
uncomfortably good looking.

49
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:23,388
But you seem remarkably at ease.

50
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,557
Oh, stop it!
No, really...

51
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,684
Well, if you must!
Ha ha! What are you doing?

52
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:30,145
Oh! That tickles!
Are those real?

53
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:36,026
That's it! Conflict! Victor, you
were right! I have been undefined!

54
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:41,114
People, I've had an epiphany!
The hero cannot exist in a vacuum!

55
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:44,493
What our story needs is
an ironic, unexpected event,

56
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,621
that will propel the hero into conflict.

57
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,928
Mister Tims?

58
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:21,298
...Oye...

59
00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:28,722
That's right! You!

60
00:06:29,932 --> 00:06:33,810
Don't be shy. Come on.
Is okay.

61
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:36,104
That's it, a little closer...

62
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:39,149
Ah. Good.

63
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:41,151
I won't bite you.

64
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,364
I need a little help here.

65
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:47,491
Uh... Are you okay?

66
00:06:47,658 --> 00:06:50,494
I must get to the other side.

67
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,996
The other side? You mean just now
that was you crossing the road?

68
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:59,962
- That's why... why did you do that?!
- This is my quest. He waits for me.

69
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,547
Whe... what... Who?

70
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:04,174
The spirit of the west, amigo.
The one.

71
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:09,680
They say he rides an alabaster carriage
with golden guardians to protect him.

72
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:11,640
Wha...
What are you talking about?

73
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:15,102
Enlightenment.
We are nothing without it.

74
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:18,689
Nothing?! Your delusional quest
just ruined my life!

75
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:21,441
I had an incredibly
complex social network!

76
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,194
Highly sophisticated friends!
I was very popular!

77
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:27,447
Friends? I don't see no friends.

78
00:07:27,823 --> 00:07:31,368
- Well, uhm...
- You are a very lonely lizard.

79
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:35,497
Now... Help me up, and I'll
help you find what you seek.

80
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:38,584
- Uhh... You will?
- Quickly now. I must get back to my quest.

81
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:42,504
- You mean, you've done this before?
- O, yes. Many times.

82
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:46,008
- Come, come. - Argh... - That'sit.
Pull my finger.

83
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:48,594
- Uhh... - The spirit is
waiting for me!

84
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:49,970
Okay, okay...

85
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:59,646
- Okay! That's not gonna work.
- I must get to the other side.

86
00:08:00,022 --> 00:08:03,442
Why don't you just wait
until there are no cars coming?

87
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:05,319
Is not so easy as it looks...

88
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:06,361
A what?

89
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,238
Is a metaphore.

90
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:39,978
Hey, there's another one!

91
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:42,731
I knew it!

92
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:56,328
You need a little help,
amigo?

93
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:59,998
I think the metaphore broke my spleen.

94
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,959
The path to knowledge
is fraught with consequence.

95
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,878
Yeah... I'm just looking for
the path to water.

96
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:10,092
If you want to find water,
you must first find Dirt.

97
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:12,678
Dirt?

98
00:09:13,262 --> 00:09:15,514
Destiny, she is kind to you.

99
00:09:15,681 --> 00:09:19,142
Tomorrow is wednesday,
the water comes.

100
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:23,188
At noon the towns people gather
for a mysterious ritual...

101
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,567
Wow! What uhhh... A town? Like
with real people and everything?

102
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:31,071
- Where? - A days journey.
Follow your shadow.

103
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:35,367
You want me to just walk out
into the desert?

104
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:36,743
Uhumm... that's the way.

105
00:09:36,952 --> 00:09:43,292
Okay. So you're saying there's a town,
a real town? Not a metaphor town?

106
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:45,502
Go on. It's okay.

107
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:49,339
Okay. Well, then I'm going.

108
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:52,926
I am leaving the road. Now!

109
00:09:53,177 --> 00:09:56,471
I'm walking... into...
the desert!

110
00:09:56,763 --> 00:10:00,767
- Alone!
- We all have our journeys to make!

111
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:04,188
I will see you on the other side...

112
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:23,665
<i>Welcome, amigo,
to the land without end,</i>

113
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:29,046
<i>the desert and death are
the closest of friends...</i>

114
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:35,552
<i>We sing of his courage
in this gleeful sung song,</i>

115
00:10:36,345 --> 00:10:42,017
<i>better pay close attention,
he won't be here long...</i>

116
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:08,043
Here in the Mojave desert, animals
have had millions of years to adapt

117
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,254
to the harsh environment.

118
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:14,049
But the lizard, he is going to die.

119
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:18,345
- Four score and seven years ago...
Our fathers... - Don't move!

120
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,305
What?

121
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:27,646
- Don't move!
- I'm not moving!

122
00:11:27,855 --> 00:11:30,732
- I'm not moving.
- Try to blend in.

123
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,901
What? Blend in?
Wha... Whaaa... What do you mean?

124
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:37,781
Blend in!

125
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,575
Huh? Wh... Wha... Wha...
What are you saying?

126
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:44,997
- Too late. - No! No! It's not too late!
I.. I'm blending! I'm a blender!

127
00:11:45,581 --> 00:11:47,499
Calm down!
What are you doing?

128
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:52,296
Don't move!

129
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:54,506
Try not to look conspicuous.

130
00:12:02,181 --> 00:12:04,349
Hey, pst!
What d'ya doing?

131
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:06,018
- I'm blending.
- Go and blend somewhere else.

132
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:07,561
- Don't distract me!
- No room at the inn!

133
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:10,063
- It's an art not a science!
- Find your own hiding place!

134
00:12:10,272 --> 00:12:14,109
- This is good. - Oh, here she comes!
You better run, Mojito!

135
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:17,988
- What? But you said "don't move".
- That was before. Now... you run!

136
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:21,783
Adios, amigo.

137
00:13:05,536 --> 00:13:07,496
Oh, hey!
Where's your basket?

138
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:09,414
Oh, thirsty?

139
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:25,556
Please! Please don't! Please don't!
I have vertigo! My glands are swollen!

140
00:13:27,099 --> 00:13:28,976
Please, no...

141
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:35,399
Hey... Madre de dios!

142
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:41,488
You! I kill you, you stupid lizard
get out of there!

143
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,074
- I can't help but taste the days
of action! - Oh just shut up and shoot!

144
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:47,786
No, wait! Come back!
I was just kidding!

145
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:49,538
- We friends, hey?
- I... I don't know you.

146
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:52,040
- Lizards, frogs... - Move over!
- We' practically related!

147
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:57,212
- Move over!
- I let you kiss my sister!

148
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:09,016
You son of a...

149
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:06,365
Where are your friends
now, amigo?

150
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,292
Heeeeeeeelp!

151
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:37,104
Get your slimy,
webbed phalanges off my boots!

152
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:42,234
- Oh! Uh... Sorry! - I got a beat on you,
stranger. You get up real slow.

153
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:45,863
Or you wanna spend your afternoon
pickin' your face back together!

154
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:47,197
No, no, no, no, ma'm,
I don't...

155
00:15:47,406 --> 00:15:49,324
- Who are you?
- Whhhoo... Am I?

156
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:53,579
I'm askin' the questions here!
We're in the middle of a drought

157
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:55,122
now someone's
dumping water in the desert.

158
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,249
Now I suppose it's indeterminable
somethin' to mention

159
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,751
but I intend to find out
what role you play in all this.

160
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:03,297
- Role?
- What are you involved in?

161
00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:05,674
Oh! Well, I... I'm glad you asked.

162
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:08,969
I've got two one acts, a mystery
and a musical I've been gestating.

163
00:16:09,553 --> 00:16:11,972
I've got the words. I'm just kinda
workin' on the melody. It's like a...

164
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:16,059
It's... I think it's gonna be
a western.

165
00:16:16,268 --> 00:16:17,394
<i>Hey, monkey got a cracker...</i>

166
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:22,024
<i>Hmhmhm... His mother's making supper...
La-la-la-la...</i>

167
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:25,736
You ain't from round here,
are you?

168
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:30,157
I... I'm... I'm still workin' on it.

169
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:32,784
Uh... So, what's your name?

170
00:16:33,619 --> 00:16:34,953
- Beans.
- That's a funny kind of name.

171
00:16:35,204 --> 00:16:38,248
What can I say, my daddy
plum loved baked beans.

172
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:40,125
Well, you're lucky
he didn't plum love asparagus.

173
00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:43,420
- What... What are you sayin'? - I mean,
I... I enjoy a hearty puttanesca myself,

174
00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:46,173
but I'm not sure that the child uh...
Would appreciate the moniker.

175
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:47,841
My daddy was a fine man.
Even if he did exibit

176
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:51,053
- proclivity for lagoons...
- Hm, spicey.

177
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:55,724
- You're eating his ashes!
- Uh. You carry his remains?

178
00:16:56,058 --> 00:16:59,561
No! His ashes. He loved to smoke.
They never found the body.

179
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:01,313
Oh! Well, I'm sure he had his reasons.

180
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,565
- What are you implyin'?
- Nothing. I...

181
00:17:03,941 --> 00:17:06,902
My daddy was never near that mine shaft.
He'd been sober for over a month.

182
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:09,905
And for you to insinuate that he would
abandon his parental responsibilities.

183
00:17:10,072 --> 00:17:13,492
At a delicate time in my personal
development is an up front to my

184
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,373
Miss Beans?

185
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:22,251
Miss Beans? Hello?

186
00:17:23,836 --> 00:17:26,088
Hee-lo?

187
00:17:42,271 --> 00:17:45,190
...And I'm telling to people that
"adndromeda 5" will return safe and sound

188
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:47,901
and I will not sell my ranch!

189
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,904
- What? - What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

190
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:52,906
- What am I doing?
- You... were cuddling me.

191
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:54,908
- We... well went frozen.
- No I didn't...

192
00:17:55,117 --> 00:17:58,412
- Yes. You stopped talking.
- That's defence mechanism.

193
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:01,373
- Actually lots of people have it.
- Now you've made that up!

194
00:18:01,665 --> 00:18:04,126
So, you're gonna die out here
or you wanna a ride into town?

195
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:06,879
No! No! No! Uh... yeah! No!
Yes please! Thank you.

196
00:18:08,172 --> 00:18:10,841
Today's wednesday.
Wednesday when we all get to it.

197
00:18:12,426 --> 00:18:13,927
So who are you really?

198
00:18:14,136 --> 00:18:15,762
Well, I'm a man of many epithets.

199
00:18:15,971 --> 00:18:18,140
There's my stage name,
my pen name, my avatar.

200
00:18:18,432 --> 00:18:20,142
Had a pseudonym once,
but had to...

201
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:24,146
And so the stranger
seeking companionship

202
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:29,067
finds a woman. Much like
the sirens of the ancient times

203
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:33,697
luring him to his certain demise.

204
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:38,660
...And I'm actually of the few men
with the maiden name!

205
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:40,996
Whow! Here we are.

206
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:48,670
Oh, oh, right...

207
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:51,465
Well, I sure do appreciate
this Miss Beans...

208
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:53,759
and if there's
anything I could...

209
00:18:55,844 --> 00:19:00,557
OK than. See ya, Beans.

210
00:19:08,357 --> 00:19:10,734
Welcome to DIRT

211
00:19:16,698 --> 00:19:19,743
- You're leaving us, Jim?
- Well, we gave it up on that shop.

212
00:19:19,952 --> 00:19:23,705
Gotta sell it. Can't roll
no crowd for I got no water.

213
00:19:24,498 --> 00:19:25,541
Bye!

214
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:33,841
What is it?

215
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:38,887
- What was that for?
- You're funny looking.

216
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:42,850
- Well, you're funny looking too!
- That's a funny looking shirt!

217
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:44,852
- That's a funny looking dress!
- You got funny looking eyes!

218
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,603
You gotta funny looking face!

219
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:51,775
You're a stranger.
Strangers don't last long here.

220
00:19:51,984 --> 00:19:56,071
- Here's your beans, Beans.
- I'm gonna need some more feed, too, willie.

221
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:00,284
Well you almost got three corts already.
I can't give you no more credits.

222
00:20:00,492 --> 00:20:02,619
But I have what I owe you at noon.

223
00:20:02,828 --> 00:20:08,917
You don't understand. It's Mr. Merrimack,
from the bank, he cut off all credits.

224
00:20:09,126 --> 00:20:10,294
Hey, Beans?

225
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:14,923
- You know that there fella?
- Beans? Miss Beans?

226
00:20:15,174 --> 00:20:16,341
- Nope.
- Hey, Beans...

227
00:20:17,426 --> 00:20:18,760
Hey...

228
00:20:19,845 --> 00:20:23,557
Oh. Right! Blend in!

229
00:21:55,023 --> 00:21:57,734
I'd like a... glass of water?

230
00:21:59,403 --> 00:22:01,572
He wants a glass of water!

231
00:22:01,989 --> 00:22:05,409
- Make it a double!
- Give him two!

232
00:22:08,662 --> 00:22:11,206
Cactus juice.
That's all we got.

233
00:22:36,315 --> 00:22:41,361
Hey, Fruitcup? You are a
long way from home, ain't ya?

234
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:45,115
Who exactly are you?

235
00:22:48,452 --> 00:22:50,412
<i>Who am I?</i>

236
00:22:51,497 --> 00:22:53,499
<i>I could be anyone.</i>

237
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:56,001
DURANGO... RANGO

238
00:22:56,877 --> 00:23:01,006
What's the matter? Your miss
your mamma's mangos?

239
00:23:02,007 --> 00:23:04,259
As a matter of fact, I am.

240
00:23:05,093 --> 00:23:08,222
But not as much as your
daddy's cooking!

241
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:12,476
Exactly... where did you say
you were from?

242
00:23:12,684 --> 00:23:15,979
Me? I'm from the West.

243
00:23:16,188 --> 00:23:20,108
Out there, beyond the horizon.
Pass the sunset.

244
00:23:20,317 --> 00:23:22,319
The Far West...

245
00:23:24,112 --> 00:23:25,697
Yea, that's right hombres.

246
00:23:25,864 --> 00:23:31,036
The place I come from, we kill a man
before breakfast, just to work up an appetite.

247
00:23:31,703 --> 00:23:35,499
We salt him and we pepper him,
we braise him clarified butter

248
00:23:35,707 --> 00:23:38,043
and then we eat him.

249
00:23:38,252 --> 00:23:40,128
- You eat him?
- That's what I said!

250
00:23:40,337 --> 00:23:44,508
Hell, I've seen things make a grown man
lose control of his glandular function.

251
00:23:44,675 --> 00:23:47,636
You spend three days in a horse
carcass, livin' off you own juices.

252
00:23:47,845 --> 00:23:51,014
It'll change a man!
Oh, yes.

253
00:23:53,183 --> 00:23:58,105
Have a few extra aces in this deck, yeah?
Just the way I like it.

254
00:23:58,981 --> 00:24:03,110
So no, my hair shootin' rodent little friend,
I am not from around these parts.

255
00:24:03,443 --> 00:24:05,195
You might say I'm from everywhere

256
00:24:05,612 --> 00:24:08,156
there's trouble brewin'
and hell waiting to be raised.

257
00:24:08,574 --> 00:24:11,493
You might say I'm
what hell's already raised up!

258
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:15,414
Name's... Rango.

259
00:24:20,586 --> 00:24:22,796
Are you that fella that
killed them Jenkins brothers?

260
00:24:23,005 --> 00:24:26,258
Aha, killed them with one bullet.

261
00:24:26,466 --> 00:24:28,343
Don't get no deader.

262
00:24:28,552 --> 00:24:30,971
All seven of 'em?

263
00:24:31,597 --> 00:24:33,348
That's right.

264
00:24:33,682 --> 00:24:35,309
All seven of them.

265
00:24:36,268 --> 00:24:40,814
Exactly how did you do that,
Mr. Rango?

266
00:24:41,732 --> 00:24:45,652
Y'know I'm glad you asked me that.
And... I would be happy to tell you!

267
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:48,405
But you all gotta have to
listen up,

268
00:24:48,614 --> 00:24:53,744
because this is where it gets...
complicated.

269
00:24:55,454 --> 00:24:58,332
I'm about to close the account, Mrs. Goats,
two go to the swig.

270
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:02,377
Hands off, Mordekao, that's what
swept off your college education!

271
00:25:04,338 --> 00:25:06,590
I don't have any other choice, Beans.

272
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:10,594
Times being so hard, we...
we just can't give no more credit.

273
00:25:10,802 --> 00:25:13,388
But this here is a bank!
This is where you keep the water.

274
00:25:13,972 --> 00:25:15,057
Keep the wate..

275
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:21,647
Beans, you've been like a niece to me.
Ever since your daddy...

276
00:25:22,523 --> 00:25:26,401
did NOT fall drunk down a mine shaft.
And uh... I've...

277
00:25:27,069 --> 00:25:31,240
I've tried to protect you and others
from certain realities.

278
00:25:32,074 --> 00:25:34,076
- Oh... the weight of them realities...
- Mr. Merrimack?

279
00:25:35,118 --> 00:25:36,245
Mr. Merrimack?

280
00:25:37,246 --> 00:25:39,039
Are you all right?

281
00:25:39,665 --> 00:25:42,376
Beans, I need to
sh... show you something.

282
00:25:50,968 --> 00:25:54,137
- That's all that's left?
- And this here is the reserve!

283
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:59,560
I don't know if you've noticed, but folks just
ain't makin' deposits on a Wednesday no more.

284
00:26:00,894 --> 00:26:03,188
If I don't get some water
I'm gonna lose my ranch,

285
00:26:03,605 --> 00:26:05,566
and you're tellin' me that's all
that's left in the whole tank!

286
00:26:05,774 --> 00:26:08,026
Now, that just don't
make no sense.

287
00:26:08,235 --> 00:26:12,239
Now, listen. Someone is
dumpin' water in the desert.

288
00:26:12,698 --> 00:26:15,617
I've seen it with my own eyes!

289
00:26:17,494 --> 00:26:22,291
Water in the desert! Was this durin'
one of your... special times?

290
00:26:22,499 --> 00:26:27,671
- No! - Well, we can all dream.
But this is the reality.

291
00:26:28,088 --> 00:26:31,800
Why do you think so many people
are sellin' out? They just can't make it.

292
00:26:32,259 --> 00:26:34,386
Well... I... what am I supposed to do?

293
00:26:36,054 --> 00:26:37,806
Well, I suppose we could talk to the Mayor.

294
00:26:38,098 --> 00:26:40,309
I hear he's been helpin'
people out in this time of crisis.

295
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,354
- The Mayor?
- He may be... our only hope.

296
00:26:44,897 --> 00:26:47,816
...bullet hits the shovel, richochets back
towards number three

297
00:26:48,275 --> 00:26:51,320
and that's where the roof gave in
ingiting with a pure green alcohol

298
00:26:51,695 --> 00:26:54,156
instantly vaporized his bodily form
into nothing but

299
00:26:54,531 --> 00:26:58,243
a charcoal statute
and high-pitched squeel.

300
00:27:02,998 --> 00:27:07,044
Ho-hold on there. That's only six.
What happend to number seven?

301
00:27:10,047 --> 00:27:13,759
Number seven? Damn...
Died of infection.

302
00:27:17,304 --> 00:27:20,641
One bullet...

303
00:27:20,849 --> 00:27:21,350
All seven men.

304
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:25,812
Dance for me!
Dance like a real chicken!

305
00:27:26,021 --> 00:27:28,232
Dance, dance.

306
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:33,529
You got coal in your ears, mate? You don't
pay the mortgage, you don't own the land!

307
00:27:34,947 --> 00:27:38,200
- That's basic real estate law, my friend.
- Your broke law!

308
00:27:38,408 --> 00:27:43,413
If I see you're face in this town again
I'm gonna slice it off.

309
00:27:43,622 --> 00:27:47,835
- And use it to wipe my unmentionables...
- Mind the beak.

310
00:27:48,961 --> 00:27:51,588
And don't come back!

311
00:27:53,215 --> 00:27:56,802
What are you all coping at?

312
00:27:59,638 --> 00:28:02,933
Hey, Bad Bill, there's something
I gotta tell ya...

313
00:28:07,229 --> 00:28:12,818
- Oi, what is this?
- You know who this is, Bill? It's Rango!

314
00:28:13,026 --> 00:28:16,655
Yeah! He ain't afraid of you.
He ain't afraid of any of you.

315
00:28:16,864 --> 00:28:19,908
- Killed them Jenkins brothers.
- Done it with one bullet, Bill...

316
00:28:20,075 --> 00:28:21,994
All seven of them!

317
00:28:22,161 --> 00:28:23,871
Is that right...

318
00:29:01,909 --> 00:29:04,244
Lemme get that for you.

319
00:29:07,998 --> 00:29:10,834
Eh... No! I know. Here.

320
00:29:14,379 --> 00:29:17,549
Just will care 'bout that
for you...

321
00:29:17,758 --> 00:29:20,135
Here! All better!

322
00:29:44,368 --> 00:29:47,037
Here, here... just a second...

323
00:29:49,581 --> 00:29:54,628
All right, listen. I wanna give you fellas
one last chance to reconsider.

324
00:29:59,216 --> 00:30:02,010
And if you don't wanna reconsider,

325
00:30:02,219 --> 00:30:06,139
I might consider
reconsidering myself.

326
00:30:16,108 --> 00:30:18,318
Now, that's what I'm
talking about!

327
00:30:18,819 --> 00:30:23,615
Yeah. All right now, listen up! Things
gonna be different now Rango's in town.

328
00:30:24,366 --> 00:30:29,371
Got some new rules; my shoe shined every
mornin', my coffee hot, Danish on the side.

329
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:32,291
Whatever you do,
don't look me in the eye!

330
00:30:32,875 --> 00:30:35,711
Stay out of my peripheral vision!

331
00:30:36,378 --> 00:30:39,673
- He ain't afraid of nobody! - He's gonna
turn that bird butt-forward!

332
00:30:39,882 --> 00:30:41,508
When you see me comin',
stand aside.

333
00:30:41,717 --> 00:30:47,181
I take large steps and I don't want
your hey-sees bodily fluids on my boots!

334
00:30:49,016 --> 00:30:55,272
Of course, there is no need for violence.
As long as we stick together, work as team.

335
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:01,486
So I want you all
to come on outside, now.

336
00:31:02,237 --> 00:31:03,113
Line up single file
while I take a recreation!

337
00:31:03,322 --> 00:31:07,034
- What's he doing now?
- I think it's A number two.

338
00:31:10,454 --> 00:31:11,955
OCUPADO

339
00:31:28,514 --> 00:31:30,474
Well, never mind!

340
00:31:50,994 --> 00:31:52,621
You can best see
over here!

341
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:55,916
Look at him!
He's taking that hawk!

342
00:31:56,124 --> 00:31:57,835
Give him here, Rango!

343
00:33:50,906 --> 00:33:53,575
- Did you see that?
- He killed than banger!

344
00:33:53,784 --> 00:33:59,122
- What do you... what do you
say, doc? - This hawk is dead!

345
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:01,875
Shoo. I say we'd cook that
right out!

346
00:34:02,084 --> 00:34:05,003
- He did it with one bullet!
- Well just like he said!

347
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:07,256
It's about time
we had a hero around here!

348
00:34:07,464 --> 00:34:09,007
One who ain't in a pine box...

349
00:34:10,551 --> 00:34:12,761
I think it's time he met the Mayor.

350
00:34:13,178 --> 00:34:15,973
- You hear that, Rango?
You're gonna meet the Mayor.

351
00:34:16,181 --> 00:34:18,308
Let's here it for Rango!

352
00:34:21,061 --> 00:34:26,817
And so the stranger basks
in the adulation of his new friends.

353
00:34:27,025 --> 00:34:32,281
Sinking deeper into the
guacamole of his own deception.

354
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:37,536
- When is he goin' to die?
- Soon, compadre. Soon.

355
00:34:53,218 --> 00:34:55,429
My land is not for sale!

356
00:34:56,638 --> 00:34:59,266
I thank you would save our land,
not sell it!

357
00:34:59,474 --> 00:35:03,395
I'm sure we'd work out something
if you just talked to him...

358
00:35:04,021 --> 00:35:06,315
Beans, where're you going?
Beans!

359
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:09,276
The Mayor will see you now.

360
00:35:14,072 --> 00:35:17,618
Water, Mr. Rango, water.

361
00:35:17,784 --> 00:35:21,413
Without it, there's nothing
but dust and decay.

362
00:35:21,622 --> 00:35:25,959
But with water... there's life.

363
00:35:27,544 --> 00:35:33,050
Look at them! They're so desperate to live
they'll follow it anywhere...

364
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,677
That's the immutable law
of the desert.

365
00:35:37,763 --> 00:35:41,683
Control the water and
you control everything else.

366
00:35:41,892 --> 00:35:47,189
This is from my private stock.
Vintage rain water, from the Great Deluge.

367
00:35:47,397 --> 00:35:52,277
Oh, not Noah's deluge.
Goodness, I'm not that old!

368
00:35:54,571 --> 00:35:59,159
- I guess power has some privileges.
- You made the good point, son.

369
00:35:59,827 --> 00:36:03,247
But with privilege comes
responsibility.

370
00:36:04,748 --> 00:36:07,709
Hell, I was Mayor here before
there was the Dirt!

371
00:36:07,918 --> 00:36:10,629
I may be just a sentimental,
old turtle...

372
00:36:11,171 --> 00:36:13,507
but I think there's a future to
this town

373
00:36:13,674 --> 00:36:15,843
and I hope you'll be part of it.

374
00:36:16,844 --> 00:36:19,763
- To Dirt!
- To Dirt!

375
00:36:22,474 --> 00:36:26,353
You see them, Mr. Rango?
All my friends and neighbours?

376
00:36:27,062 --> 00:36:31,066
It's a hard life here...
Very hard...

377
00:36:31,275 --> 00:36:34,862
Do you know how they make it
through each and every day?

378
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:39,658
They believe. They believe
it's going to be better.

379
00:36:39,867 --> 00:36:43,328
They believe that the water
will come!

380
00:36:43,537 --> 00:36:46,290
They believe against all odds
and all evidence

381
00:36:46,832 --> 00:36:48,709
that tomorrow will be
better than today.

382
00:36:50,419 --> 00:36:53,297
People have to believe in
something.

383
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:57,759
Right now,
they believe in you.

384
00:36:58,969 --> 00:37:01,221
Pick it up, Mr. Rango.

385
00:37:01,555 --> 00:37:03,974
Your destiny awaits.

386
00:37:06,852 --> 00:37:10,272
People have to believe in
something.

387
00:37:15,527 --> 00:37:16,820
It just don't make no sense.

388
00:37:17,029 --> 00:37:20,991
This whole town is drying up
and the Mayor seems

389
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,701
the only one who's not affected!

390
00:37:22,868 --> 00:37:22,993
Don't that make you just
a wee bit suspicious?

391
00:37:23,202 --> 00:37:27,456
What about that water I saw out
in the desert? I seen it with my own eyes!

392
00:37:27,664 --> 00:37:31,043
Alright! No need to insight anxiety.
I'll inquire about the Mayor.

393
00:37:31,251 --> 00:37:38,133
If you really feel there's some conspiracy,
I suggest you take it up with the new sheriff!

394
00:37:50,771 --> 00:37:51,647
Excuse me, Mr. Rango?

395
00:38:03,242 --> 00:38:06,995
- I will blow that ugly right off your face!
- Uh... I was just thinkin' that uh..

396
00:38:07,204 --> 00:38:10,207
Oh! You want the old John Hancock,
do you? Well, here hold this.

397
00:38:10,415 --> 00:38:15,087
- This isn't a social call!
- Oh, I know all about the all dig...

398
00:38:15,295 --> 00:38:17,172
I ordered myself some
nice fancy-dandies.

399
00:38:17,381 --> 00:38:20,175
- Mr. Rango! - You too? No problems, just...
- I need you to investigate...

400
00:38:20,384 --> 00:38:23,303
You know Beans, I bet you clean up
real nice if you put a little effort into it.

401
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,765
Son, stay in school, eat your veggies,
burn everything but Shakespear.

402
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:31,895
- Who... who's Shakespeare?
- Sheriff Rango! If that is your real name!

403
00:38:32,271 --> 00:38:35,232
I am tryin' to save my daddy's ranch,
which is on the verge

404
00:38:35,732 --> 00:38:38,360
of an agricultural meltdown while
you're playin' patty cake with each...

405
00:38:40,863 --> 00:38:44,366
Sad girl...
Such a drabbly pain..

406
00:38:44,908 --> 00:38:45,993
Why does she do that?

407
00:38:46,201 --> 00:38:49,204
- It's a survival reflex.
- Her switch is just broken.

408
00:38:49,371 --> 00:38:51,123
Well! That's an inconvenience.

409
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,959
It is not a rash!
It is a birth mark.

410
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,588
- I did it again, didn't I?
- Did what?

411
00:38:58,005 --> 00:39:00,090
Let me ask you something...

412
00:39:00,591 --> 00:39:04,136
Did anybody here mention to you
what happened to our last sheriff?

413
00:39:43,634 --> 00:39:50,432
Uh... May I ask you... the last sheriff.
Pardon me...

414
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:54,228
Where did everybody go?
What happened to him?

415
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:35,102
Oh... oh... I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

416
00:40:46,155 --> 00:40:49,700
His is heck of a hoedown you got goin'.
Still workin' out those steps.

417
00:40:49,908 --> 00:40:52,369
So, is this considered
normal civic behavior?

418
00:40:52,578 --> 00:40:56,081
Mmhmm. Every Wednesday.
Just like clock work.

419
00:40:56,832 --> 00:41:01,336
- You kill bird? - Yea, ha...
as a matter of fact, I did.

420
00:41:01,545 --> 00:41:03,964
Bird dead. Snake come.

421
00:41:04,173 --> 00:41:07,009
- Is it snake? - He means
Rattlesnake Jake, Mr. Rango.

422
00:41:07,217 --> 00:41:10,721
He wasn't coming to town because
he was scared of that hawk.

423
00:41:10,929 --> 00:41:13,473
But might come now. May I have
your boots when you're dead?

424
00:41:13,682 --> 00:41:18,145
- No! Rango's got no problem with this Rattlesnake
Jake. - That's exactly what Amos said.

425
00:41:18,353 --> 00:41:19,897
Amos?

426
00:41:21,315 --> 00:41:22,691
Sheriff AMOS
Thursday - Friday

427
00:41:23,233 --> 00:41:24,902
You got any gold fillings?

428
00:41:44,129 --> 00:41:46,757
My fellow Dirtonians!

429
00:41:46,965 --> 00:41:53,180
- I welcome you to this great day
of deliverance! Halellujah! - Halellujah!

430
00:41:53,931 --> 00:41:57,726
Acolytes, prepare
the holly spigot!

431
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:14,117
We have a newcomer amongst us,
a man I think needs little introduction

432
00:42:14,326 --> 00:42:18,413
to you, so bold has been his entry
into our fair society.

433
00:42:18,622 --> 00:42:21,333
Mr. Rango?
Would you step forward?

434
00:42:21,542 --> 00:42:23,752
- Mine!
- Mine!

435
00:42:27,798 --> 00:42:33,220
- The time has come! The time
that was foretold! - Hallelujah!

436
00:42:34,054 --> 00:42:36,473
- The sacred time!
- Hallelujah!

437
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:41,311
- The time of destiny!
- Hallelujah!

438
00:42:41,645 --> 00:42:44,356
- The time of deliverance!
- Hallelujah!

439
00:42:45,107 --> 00:42:49,820
It is the time of... hydration!

440
00:43:05,335 --> 00:43:08,172
- It's his fault!
- It's the newcomer! - Burn him!

441
00:43:08,589 --> 00:43:10,841
- He's a witch!
- I want his boots!

442
00:43:11,175 --> 00:43:14,052
My friends! My friends!
Temper your frustrations.

443
00:43:14,261 --> 00:43:19,141
Times will be tough from now on.
Sacrifices have to be made.

444
00:43:19,391 --> 00:43:23,437
But if I can help in any way,
please know that my door is always...

445
00:43:23,729 --> 00:43:27,566
Hold it! Hold it! Now this whole
thing stinks three ways to Sunday!

446
00:43:27,774 --> 00:43:30,611
First the bank's run dry,
and now this here spigot!

447
00:43:30,944 --> 00:43:32,488
- Bank's run dry?
- What's she talkin' about?

448
00:43:32,905 --> 00:43:34,990
She said there's no
water in the bank!

449
00:43:37,784 --> 00:43:39,495
I want mine in cash!

450
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:44,166
- We can't just give away...
- We can't move again!

451
00:43:46,543 --> 00:43:51,048
There'll be no civil disobedience
in my town. Thank you very much!

452
00:43:53,217 --> 00:43:55,677
Thank Goodness you're here, sheriff.
Things were getting outta hand!

453
00:43:55,886 --> 00:43:57,304
Ooo... come right in,
join us.

454
00:43:57,846 --> 00:44:02,601
Well now! Let me get the source
of the societal discontentment here.

455
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:06,188
Go... ho... hod, have mercy...

456
00:44:07,147 --> 00:44:11,068
All right. Listen up! I've been thinkin'
and I believe I figured somethin' out.

457
00:44:11,443 --> 00:44:14,530
You folks have a water problem!

458
00:44:16,073 --> 00:44:18,784
Now, just pay attention everybody!
I'm tryin' to make a point here.

459
00:44:19,201 --> 00:44:21,662
Let's say this fella here were
to take a drink of water.

460
00:44:22,037 --> 00:44:24,832
Just one little drink.
No harm, no foul. Right?

461
00:44:27,417 --> 00:44:31,672
And you! Why you're just as dried up
and parched as a Jack rabbit in July!

462
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:34,758
So you belly on up and
take you a double shot!

463
00:44:36,218 --> 00:44:38,178
Stay with me...

464
00:44:38,846 --> 00:44:41,056
What do you think happens then?
Why we'd all be drinkin'!

465
00:44:41,265 --> 00:44:46,311
Before you know it,
there wouldn't be anymore water!

466
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:48,814
And then where would we be?

467
00:44:49,982 --> 00:44:53,944
We'd be thirsty!
Real thirsty!

468
00:44:54,153 --> 00:44:57,197
Why we'd turn on each other
like a bunch of animals!

469
00:44:59,533 --> 00:45:05,080
Now, look here. We have got
six days of water...

470
00:45:09,209 --> 00:45:12,379
- Fi.. - We have got five
days of water.

471
00:45:13,463 --> 00:45:18,343
As long as we got water,
we got ourselves a town.

472
00:45:19,803 --> 00:45:24,183
Sheriff Rango is right. As long
as we have this water, we have some hope.

473
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:27,436
And you can all take it from me.
My one hundred percent

474
00:45:27,978 --> 00:45:33,233
full time employment from this moment
I'll protect our precious, natural, resource.

475
00:45:35,694 --> 00:45:38,238
Ain't no one gonna tango
with the Rango!

476
00:45:50,667 --> 00:45:52,628
- Good evening, ladies.
- Good evening, sheriff.

477
00:45:53,754 --> 00:45:57,549
Hold on their, Gordy. Now you
get on back in there and assert yourself.

478
00:45:57,883 --> 00:46:03,430
I think you'll find the people in this
town to be surprising hospitable.

479
00:46:03,639 --> 00:46:04,640
Thank you, sheriff!

480
00:46:04,848 --> 00:46:06,683
What? Not you!

481
00:46:07,684 --> 00:46:09,811
I stand corrected.

482
00:46:15,776 --> 00:46:18,111
- This ain't the bank!
- Hold you, Jedidiah!

483
00:46:18,278 --> 00:46:20,948
- Hold it right there!
- It's the sheriff.

484
00:46:21,114 --> 00:46:23,200
Get them hands up
where I can see 'em.

485
00:46:23,408 --> 00:46:28,872
Just as I suspected. Prospecting
without authorized equipment!

486
00:46:29,206 --> 00:46:31,166
- Don't move a muscle!
- Prospectors?

487
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:39,132
Now, here's the shovels, pickaxe, drills,
some snacks, puzzle works

488
00:46:39,466 --> 00:46:41,969
and you gonna need the permit.

489
00:46:42,761 --> 00:46:45,138
Ezekiel! Jedidiah! What the
Sam hill's goin' on up there?

490
00:46:45,347 --> 00:46:49,059
I've had colobs removed
smarter than the two of you!

491
00:46:49,268 --> 00:46:54,231
- Hells bar! This ain't the bank! - Pappy,
the Sheriff is standin' right here!

492
00:46:54,439 --> 00:46:57,943
- Helpin' us out.
- Gonna give us a permit for prospecting.

493
00:46:58,152 --> 00:47:01,196
That's right, sir. Just doin' my duty.
The lonely constable on his rounds,

494
00:47:01,530 --> 00:47:06,451
keepin' and eagle eye out
for meyham and malfeasance.

495
00:47:06,618 --> 00:47:09,246
- Does he look like he sounds?
- Uhum.

496
00:47:10,038 --> 00:47:15,836
If we was to hit the mother load,
being prospectors and such,

497
00:47:16,044 --> 00:47:19,214
where would we deposit said annuity?

498
00:47:19,423 --> 00:47:24,887
Well, in Dirt we happen to have the finest
financial institution this side of Missouri.

499
00:47:25,971 --> 00:47:29,141
Protected mornin', noon and night
by yours truly.

500
00:47:30,642 --> 00:47:32,477
Much obliged.

501
00:47:32,686 --> 00:47:35,689
The bank's been robbed!
The bank's been robbed!

502
00:47:35,898 --> 00:47:38,525
O, God Lord,
the bank's been robbed!

503
00:47:38,734 --> 00:47:41,195
- What's goin' on?
- I don't know. The water is gone!

504
00:47:41,361 --> 00:47:43,614
- What's he sayin'?
- The bank's been robbed!

505
00:47:43,989 --> 00:47:47,534
Doctor Marx, I'm on fire,
embrace me!

506
00:47:48,118 --> 00:47:50,704
<i>The bank's been robbed,
the town is striked...</i>

507
00:47:50,913 --> 00:47:55,709
<i>to die of thirst or equal,
what they thought is all his fault</i>

508
00:47:56,084 --> 00:47:59,505
All right folks, stand back, clear
the area, this is a crime scene now.

509
00:47:59,713 --> 00:48:02,549
Secure the perimeter, dust for prints
and fiber, scamper DNA.

510
00:48:03,634 --> 00:48:06,386
I wanna urin sample from everyone
and get me a latte.

511
00:48:06,595 --> 00:48:08,013
Don't mix up the two...

512
00:48:08,222 --> 00:48:12,643
- What's this? Prospecting permit?
- I'll take that. Material evidence!

513
00:48:12,851 --> 00:48:15,562
- What are we doin' now, sheriff?
- We need that water.

514
00:48:15,771 --> 00:48:20,818
- We're all gonna die! - Friends,
we all know what we have to do now.

515
00:48:21,026 --> 00:48:24,655
That's right. We all know
what we have to do now.

516
00:48:24,863 --> 00:48:26,698
And that would be?

517
00:48:26,907 --> 00:48:29,493
Form a possum!

518
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:33,330
A posse.

519
00:48:34,331 --> 00:48:37,417
Now we gonna be doing this
in orderly fashion.

520
00:48:37,626 --> 00:48:43,465
First of all, does anybody here know
how to use a firearm of any kind?

521
00:48:45,467 --> 00:48:46,885
All right then.

522
00:48:47,094 --> 00:48:48,846
What do we do now,
sheriff?

523
00:48:49,847 --> 00:48:52,432
Now... we ride.

524
00:49:04,945 --> 00:49:08,115
- Where're we going?
- What?

525
00:49:08,532 --> 00:49:10,951
Where're we going?

526
00:49:17,416 --> 00:49:21,128
Now, as my deputy you'll be in charge
of all trackin' and findin' of villains.

527
00:49:21,545 --> 00:49:24,256
Utilizin' your well developed ingenuity.
No offense taken.

528
00:49:24,715 --> 00:49:26,842
So which way do you think they went?
You wanna sniff the air...

529
00:49:27,176 --> 00:49:29,761
or commune
with a buffalo or somethin'?

530
00:49:31,972 --> 00:49:34,141
Oh... you're good!

531
00:49:36,518 --> 00:49:41,023
I am depending on you, Spoons.
You got a little tobacco in your beard.

532
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:45,944
Always good to have a medical man on, doc?
Reptiles gotta stick together!

533
00:49:46,236 --> 00:49:49,948
- Right, my brother? - I'm an amphibian.
- Ain't no shame in that...

534
00:49:50,866 --> 00:49:55,829
- Woh! Are you sure you're fit for
duty there, soldier? - What?

535
00:49:56,872 --> 00:49:59,541
Well, you gotta a little
something in your eye there...

536
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,129
Oh, that! That there is conjunctivitis, sir.
It's hereditary.

537
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:07,841
Oh... I'm glad to hear
it ain't contageous.

538
00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:12,221
Now, just wait a cotton pickin' minute!
A posse ain't no place for a...

539
00:50:13,222 --> 00:50:14,515
Never mind.

540
00:50:15,182 --> 00:50:17,768
Woh! Woh! Hold on there, little sister.
Someone's gonna have to look

541
00:50:18,143 --> 00:50:22,898
- after the town while I'm gone.
- Can I get to shoot someone?

542
00:50:23,774 --> 00:50:25,859
Uh... let's put a pin in that.

543
00:50:27,903 --> 00:50:29,905
Sheriff, you're gonna bring that water
back, aren't you?

544
00:50:30,113 --> 00:50:31,073
Count on it, little sister.

545
00:50:32,241 --> 00:50:36,078
- Which way do we go, sheriff?
- There's tunnels everywhere!

546
00:50:37,579 --> 00:50:39,164
The whole town is purpurated
with them.

547
00:50:39,373 --> 00:50:42,417
How'd them fellas found
the bank, anyways?

548
00:50:42,626 --> 00:50:47,297
- Khm... Gentlemen, if we can stay
on the task here? - Sheriff, over here.

549
00:50:50,884 --> 00:50:52,594
Would you look at that!

550
00:50:52,803 --> 00:50:55,305
- Like seeing the face of God!
- Amen, brother.

551
00:50:55,556 --> 00:50:58,350
I remember when it used to flow
every Wednesday.

552
00:50:58,934 --> 00:51:00,394
Those were the halcyon days...

553
00:51:00,561 --> 00:51:01,270
Must be a reason she quit
on us...

554
00:51:01,436 --> 00:51:04,898
Whatever the reason, someone
is controlling this here water!

555
00:51:05,107 --> 00:51:07,192
What do you say, sheriff?

556
00:51:08,026 --> 00:51:10,988
Clearly, the robbers came
from this direction.

557
00:51:11,196 --> 00:51:15,409
I say we track this pipe
back to its hydraulic origin,

558
00:51:15,617 --> 00:51:18,036
and apprehend the culprits
behind this aquatic conundrum.

559
00:51:18,245 --> 00:51:21,248
- What'd he say? - I thin he said
follow the pipe. - He said follow the pipe.

560
00:51:34,011 --> 00:51:39,141
Whatever you do,
do not look down!

561
00:51:40,976 --> 00:51:44,521
- What is this place?
- It's an aquafor.

562
00:51:45,355 --> 00:51:49,818
- Ah... What is aquafor?
- Well, it's for aqua.

563
00:51:50,402 --> 00:51:52,488
Well, it's empy now!

564
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:13,300
Thank you, big one.

565
00:52:15,802 --> 00:52:18,680
- It's the end of the line.
- Don't go no further.

566
00:52:18,847 --> 00:52:22,100
Someone or something is
messing with our hydration.

567
00:52:22,309 --> 00:52:24,061
And that pipe has something
to do with it.

568
00:52:24,269 --> 00:52:26,563
Now, I thought we was following
bank robbers!

569
00:52:26,855 --> 00:52:26,855
We're experiencing a paradox shift!

570
00:52:27,064 --> 00:52:30,567
I'm gonna shift the features
on your face if you don't shut up!

571
00:52:32,986 --> 00:52:36,156
Quite you savages! Stop your battlin'.
You're effectin' my cogitation.

572
00:52:38,534 --> 00:52:39,827
Wow! I got it!

573
00:52:40,035 --> 00:52:41,703
Snap out them torches!

574
00:52:48,669 --> 00:52:50,963
Smart thinking there,
fellow!

575
00:52:51,421 --> 00:52:54,049
- Start climbing!
- Get your boot out of my face!

576
00:52:54,466 --> 00:52:56,760
- Not bad, ha, Beans?
- If you keep thinking like that,

577
00:52:57,010 --> 00:52:59,304
- your hat's gonna catch on fire.
- Well, you know...

578
00:52:59,596 --> 00:53:03,892
You get on the road...
Ahhh! Hot, hot, burn, ow...

579
00:53:13,777 --> 00:53:17,573
Poor things... All they wanted
was a little water.

580
00:53:17,865 --> 00:53:21,201
Cactus dying of thirst?
They don't bold way...

581
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:23,412
- Hey look what I've found!
- What'd you got?

582
00:53:23,745 --> 00:53:25,330
- I saw it first!
- It got some water!

583
00:53:25,706 --> 00:53:27,416
- It's mine!
- Give me that!

584
00:53:27,875 --> 00:53:31,336
- Aaa... It's empty anyway.
- I knew that...

585
00:53:31,795 --> 00:53:35,507
- Hey, where'd you find that?
- Sheriff, you gonna wanna see this!

586
00:53:39,344 --> 00:53:41,180
It's Mr. Merrimack,
from the bank.

587
00:53:41,638 --> 00:53:43,682
- What's he doing here?
- Everybody stand back!

588
00:53:44,141 --> 00:53:47,060
- All right, lemme see it. - Looks like
them barriment shot him in the back!

589
00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:49,605
No... this man wasn't shot.

590
00:53:49,897 --> 00:53:51,773
He was drowned.

591
00:53:52,191 --> 00:53:54,193
- Drowned?
- In the middle of the desert?

592
00:53:54,651 --> 00:53:57,196
Oh, what a way to go...

593
00:53:57,779 --> 00:54:01,575
Well now... who's boot prints
are those?

594
00:54:04,703 --> 00:54:10,417
- That's interesting. Ground still wet...
- I suppose we should bury him...

595
00:54:10,751 --> 00:54:15,255
- Oh, no... birds gotta eat too.
- Circle of life!

596
00:54:15,631 --> 00:54:20,761
Hey, what's that there dumb
Indian doin'?

597
00:54:23,347 --> 00:54:25,933
I see you're consulting
with the spirits.

598
00:54:26,266 --> 00:54:29,311
No, I'm molting.
Means I'm ready to mate.

599
00:54:29,853 --> 00:54:32,272
Oh. I'll keep that in mind.

600
00:54:32,689 --> 00:54:34,525
Cactus fruit.

601
00:54:34,983 --> 00:54:36,735
Ah, yes. The ancient cactus fruit!

602
00:54:37,194 --> 00:54:40,113
I believe you people use it as seasoning
while preparing your native dishes.

603
00:54:40,447 --> 00:54:43,075
Also natural laxative.

604
00:54:43,742 --> 00:54:48,747
Pick up trail. Three men, headed west.
One blind. One with...

605
00:54:49,581 --> 00:54:52,918
...a large prostate, riding side saddle.

606
00:54:53,335 --> 00:54:55,504
- What... What'd he say?
- They're ridin' side saddle!

607
00:54:55,879 --> 00:54:57,589
- What? - Sshh! We're whisperin'.
- What'd he say?

608
00:54:58,131 --> 00:54:59,633
Someone's got a bad south.

609
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:02,094
All right. Which one of you
fellas need a check up?

610
00:55:02,469 --> 00:55:04,096
Awkward.

611
00:55:04,847 --> 00:55:08,141
Aaa... what exactly are we
gonna do now?

612
00:55:08,475 --> 00:55:11,687
Now? We ride.

613
00:55:15,858 --> 00:55:20,445
That means we're riding now!
This moment.

614
00:56:02,779 --> 00:56:05,407
Marshmallows remind me of
goin' campin' with my daddy.

615
00:56:05,866 --> 00:56:07,576
I could eat 'em all night long.

616
00:56:09,203 --> 00:56:12,831
Of course, he did make me cough
'em back up again for breakfast.

617
00:56:14,583 --> 00:56:17,252
This one time,
I coughed up an entire Dalmatian.

618
00:56:17,461 --> 00:56:21,131
That ain't nothin'.
I coughed up a whole tribe of Pygmies.

619
00:56:21,715 --> 00:56:24,092
They started lookin' at me weird.

620
00:56:24,676 --> 00:56:26,929
I remember them.
They was quit friendly.

621
00:56:27,513 --> 00:56:31,433
I found a human spinal column
in my fecal matter once.

622
00:56:33,393 --> 00:56:36,313
You might wanna get
that looked at.

623
00:56:37,439 --> 00:56:39,274
Pass the beans, Beans.

624
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:41,902
- Sheriff?
- No, thanks...

625
00:56:42,444 --> 00:56:46,073
Mr. Rango, can you tell us
about the Spirit of the West?

626
00:56:46,657 --> 00:56:49,535
- Oh, yes, talk about that?
- Is it true what they say?

627
00:56:51,161 --> 00:56:56,583
Ah... yes... the Spirit of the West.
The eternally unobtainable eye view.

628
00:56:56,959 --> 00:57:01,255
They say he rides in an alabaster carriage
with golden guardians to protect him.

629
00:57:02,339 --> 00:57:06,009
But he only appears to those
who have undertaken an epic quest...

630
00:57:06,426 --> 00:57:10,264
and have made it to the other side.

631
00:57:13,225 --> 00:57:15,602
Uh... Other side of what?

632
00:57:15,978 --> 00:57:20,399
- It's a metaphore. - My eye!
- Uh... that's gonna heal right up.

633
00:57:21,859 --> 00:57:24,611
Sheriff, what're you going to do
about Rattlesnake Jake?

634
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:27,656
Hm? What? Where!?

635
00:57:27,948 --> 00:57:31,702
Sorry 'bout that. Word is, you come
against him once or twice.

636
00:57:32,119 --> 00:57:35,497
Ooh! Yeah! Jake!
You mean, my brother.

637
00:57:35,914 --> 00:57:38,584
- Your brother?
- That's what I said!

638
00:57:38,959 --> 00:57:41,545
But... he's a snake and
you're a lizard.

639
00:57:42,004 --> 00:57:44,756
Well, mamma had an active...
social life.

640
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:48,594
- Did he ever bite you?
- Sure enough did. Look at that baby.

641
00:57:49,011 --> 00:57:53,932
- Go ahead. You can touch it.
- Oh. That's interesting. It's a belly button.

642
00:57:54,391 --> 00:57:57,644
Luckily I'm immune to his venom.
Put some in my coffee to get a little tang.

643
00:57:58,061 --> 00:58:00,189
Is it true he's only scared of
them hawks?

644
00:58:00,606 --> 00:58:04,610
Them is what we call...
natural predators.

645
00:58:05,068 --> 00:58:08,280
All this talk about them devils is
splitting my queels on edge!

646
00:58:08,655 --> 00:58:11,742
- I ain't sleeping tonight. No, sir!
- Don't you all worry 'bout a thing.

647
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:16,872
Come tomorrow we'll locate that water
and return to a hero as well!

648
00:58:17,331 --> 00:58:22,419
Friends, before we bunk down, I'd like
us all to join hands for a moments.

649
00:58:22,753 --> 00:58:25,339
Say a few words
to the Spirit of the West...

650
00:58:25,797 --> 00:58:27,674
Good idea.

651
00:58:29,092 --> 00:58:32,221
Ain't always spoken rightly to you,
Spirit of the West,

652
00:58:33,138 --> 00:58:38,560
but tonight I wanna thank you for
bringing Sheriff Rango into our lives.

653
00:58:38,936 --> 00:58:43,941
It's a hard life we got. Sometimes
I don't know how we're gonna make it,

654
00:58:44,358 --> 00:58:48,153
but somehow Sheriff Rango
makes me think we will.

655
00:58:48,529 --> 00:58:52,074
We needed a brave man
and you sent us one.

656
00:58:52,449 --> 00:58:55,285
Nice to have someone
to believe in again.

657
00:58:55,744 --> 00:58:59,873
Thank you,
Spirit of the West. Amen.

658
00:59:00,207 --> 00:59:02,459
Amen.

659
00:59:34,324 --> 00:59:36,702
Just checkin'...

660
00:59:38,495 --> 00:59:43,041
- It's so cold tonight.
- Thank you.

661
00:59:43,709 --> 00:59:46,837
You ever feel like
those things are lookin' at you?

662
00:59:47,045 --> 00:59:51,466
That's a Spanish Dagger. But around here
we just call 'em the Walkin' Cactus.

663
00:59:51,675 --> 00:59:56,597
- Walking? - There's an old legend they
actually walk across the desert to find water.

664
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:59,683
When I was a little girl I'd stay up
late watchin' if they move.

665
00:59:59,892 --> 01:00:03,604
I thought if I could follow them,
they'd lead me to some place wonderful.

666
01:00:03,812 --> 01:00:08,025
Some place with enough water
for everyone...

667
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:13,489
Night after night I watched 'em.
I never saw 'em move.

668
01:00:13,822 --> 01:00:18,285
- But you're still watching? - Who didn't
wanna find some place wonderful?

669
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:22,706
We'll find the water, Beans.
I promise you.

670
01:00:24,833 --> 01:00:27,794
That's such a lonely sound.

671
01:00:28,253 --> 01:00:31,423
- You ever get lonely?
- Sometimes.

672
01:00:31,798 --> 01:00:36,762
I can't imagine it. You're such a charmer
and everyone likes you so much.

673
01:00:37,095 --> 01:00:40,974
- I never made friends easily
like that. - No?

674
01:00:41,350 --> 01:00:43,602
No. We're pretty isolated
out there on the ranch.

675
01:00:44,061 --> 01:00:46,188
Sorta of like being sealed up
in a little box.

676
01:00:46,396 --> 01:00:49,441
Don't really see uh... a lot of folks.

677
01:00:49,858 --> 01:00:52,194
I wouldn't know what that's like.

678
01:00:52,569 --> 01:00:55,447
Is there someone special
in your life, Rango?

679
01:00:55,864 --> 01:00:58,325
Oh! Well, there used to be.
But she couldn't keep her head.

680
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:01,119
Besides... My life's too dangerous
for that kind of thing.

681
01:01:01,537 --> 01:01:04,331
You know, it's an awful solitary
existence out there on the prairie.

682
01:01:04,790 --> 01:01:07,251
Ridin' the ranges and the such like...

683
01:01:07,751 --> 01:01:10,212
Beans?

684
01:01:34,403 --> 01:01:37,990
Disfunctional family...
Need intervention.

685
01:01:38,574 --> 01:01:41,160
What's that coming?

686
01:01:42,035 --> 01:01:45,205
It's the water!

687
01:01:46,290 --> 01:01:50,210
I have a plan! And each and every
one of you has a part to play.

688
01:01:50,669 --> 01:01:53,922
- What do I do? - Spoons, you've got
the most important job of all!

689
01:01:54,339 --> 01:01:56,550
You will stay up here on the ridge,
and if anything goes wrong,

690
01:01:57,009 --> 01:01:59,720
you give... the signal.

691
01:02:06,185 --> 01:02:10,105
Muh. Mmmuh!
Mmmmuh! Hmmmuh!

692
01:02:10,606 --> 01:02:13,150
Beans, what size of dress
you're wearing?

693
01:02:13,650 --> 01:02:15,861
- I've done it!
- Hallelujah!

694
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:18,197
- I have the water!
- You did it, son.

695
01:02:18,572 --> 01:02:21,533
- Well, actually...
- Why can't you be like your brother?

696
01:02:22,075 --> 01:02:24,453
Pappy, about that water, there's
something I gotta tell you...

697
01:02:24,912 --> 01:02:28,248
Hush! Hush up now!
Somebody's comin'!

698
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:32,336
Gracious! Good afternoon
to thee and thee and thee!

699
01:02:33,003 --> 01:02:38,217
May I present my Madame Repones steps
accordion troops of travelling thespians!

700
01:02:38,759 --> 01:02:41,261
- What is that?
- I think they's thespians!

701
01:02:41,595 --> 01:02:44,139
Thespians!
That's illegal in seven states.

702
01:02:44,806 --> 01:02:47,976
The stage is set, the princess
prepares to take her own life.

703
01:02:48,393 --> 01:02:50,103
I yearn for love.

704
01:02:50,562 --> 01:02:53,607
Meanwhile, the lone centry
stands and watch at the castle gate.

705
01:02:54,149 --> 01:02:56,109
Hark! Who goes there?

706
01:02:56,819 --> 01:02:59,738
- This plots highly predictable!
- Quite! This is my favorite part!

707
01:03:00,197 --> 01:03:03,909
Arriving to great fanfare
was her aging father.

708
01:03:05,494 --> 01:03:07,704
Strike a spike, Cupid.

709
01:03:09,248 --> 01:03:14,586
Ergh... pretty... unhand... my fair daughter.
And reach for the...

710
01:03:15,671 --> 01:03:19,132
Line? Reach for the sky!

711
01:03:20,884 --> 01:03:24,429
- Wha... what was that?
- Must be one of them immersive talers.

712
01:03:24,721 --> 01:03:26,515
We got you surrounded!

713
01:03:26,890 --> 01:03:29,309
You and your entire family get your
hands up where I can see 'em.

714
01:03:29,726 --> 01:03:33,021
Ha, my entire family?

715
01:03:37,151 --> 01:03:40,988
<i>Grits and spit and collard greens</i>

716
01:03:41,071 --> 01:03:45,325
<i>Waffle chitlins, monkey brains</i>

717
01:03:45,409 --> 01:03:49,454
<i>Refried bones and booger blood</i>

718
01:03:49,538 --> 01:03:52,499
<i>Pickled eggs and flaps of mud</i>

719
01:03:54,835 --> 01:03:58,255
O, it's a full house!

720
01:03:58,547 --> 01:04:02,926
Looks like we gonna have ourselves
a good oldfashioned stand-off.

721
01:04:03,260 --> 01:04:06,972
I'll have you know you are not
looking at our entire continuing.

722
01:04:13,270 --> 01:04:17,774
- Wha... What's that? What's that
supposed to be? - That's the signal.

723
01:04:18,108 --> 01:04:21,695
That's the signal. Something
must have gone wrong!

724
01:04:25,407 --> 01:04:29,244
So... uhm, something's
supposed to happen?

725
01:04:29,786 --> 01:04:33,040
I... am... open to suggestions.

726
01:04:40,047 --> 01:04:42,299
Run!

727
01:04:47,888 --> 01:04:49,765
Get on the wagon!

728
01:04:55,813 --> 01:04:58,690
Do we have ourselves some
sport turns?

729
01:04:59,566 --> 01:05:05,489
- Ha... I likes it when they run.
- Mabel, give the holler!

730
01:05:10,994 --> 01:05:14,456
- Looks like we've made it!
- They're on into to square spots?

731
01:05:14,706 --> 01:05:17,960
Yea! I hope them conmen to
spook right out!

732
01:05:44,194 --> 01:05:45,612
They got bats!

733
01:05:45,821 --> 01:05:48,448
Oh... Here, you drive.

734
01:05:55,914 --> 01:06:00,127
Looks like it's gonna be
soft dinner, come on!

735
01:06:10,762 --> 01:06:13,348
You damnation!
Don't shoot the water!

736
01:06:13,807 --> 01:06:18,353
- Jedidiah, it's time for the
Alabaman squeeze-box! - OK, paps.

737
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:29,072
- I'm sensing hostility.
- They're coming!

738
01:06:33,869 --> 01:06:36,788
- Helloo!
- Good bye!

739
01:06:46,423 --> 01:06:49,593
Lassoo that swag!

740
01:07:09,321 --> 01:07:13,575
- I suggest we take the days of
action! - Just shut up and shoot!

741
01:07:14,034 --> 01:07:16,453
- What happened to the sheriff?
- They got him.

742
01:07:16,745 --> 01:07:20,123
Bosefus, give 'em some
jumbo now!

743
01:07:25,087 --> 01:07:28,340
What was that?
Go, check it out.

744
01:07:29,383 --> 01:07:32,261
What is it?
Is there a problem?

745
01:07:33,011 --> 01:07:35,430
Ah... you can count on that.

746
01:08:23,770 --> 01:08:25,606
Headache!

747
01:08:27,065 --> 01:08:29,651
Is that all you got?

748
01:08:47,127 --> 01:08:50,506
That was not yet that unpleasant!

749
01:09:02,810 --> 01:09:05,103
Hey, here! Hold this!

750
01:09:14,279 --> 01:09:16,698
You get your hands of me!

751
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:28,460
Hold on!

752
01:09:31,964 --> 01:09:33,632
Jump!

753
01:09:56,071 --> 01:09:57,698
That's impossible!

754
01:09:58,115 --> 01:10:00,951
It can't be. It's empty.

755
01:10:01,326 --> 01:10:03,036
There's no water!

756
01:10:03,537 --> 01:10:06,540
No water? What the hell
have we been fightin' for?

757
01:10:06,957 --> 01:10:10,836
Sir! You have defauled and desacrated
the very sustainance of our livelihood.

758
01:10:11,253 --> 01:10:13,839
I think that part
in that dress is the sheriff.

759
01:10:14,298 --> 01:10:16,508
That's the same fella who gave us
the prospecting permit?

760
01:10:17,050 --> 01:10:19,469
- A what!?
- Irelevant! Confiscation!

761
01:10:19,887 --> 01:10:21,847
You and your kin are
under arrest for bank robbery

762
01:10:22,181 --> 01:10:24,057
and the murder of our beloved
financial advisor

763
01:10:24,391 --> 01:10:27,311
Johannes Merymack III,
a.k.a... Fluffy Joe.

764
01:10:27,811 --> 01:10:30,230
Sheriff, we ain't killed nobody.
We tunelled into that vault,

765
01:10:30,564 --> 01:10:32,316
but there was nothing in it.

766
01:10:32,733 --> 01:10:34,485
Someone robbed that bank
before we robbed it.

767
01:10:34,818 --> 01:10:36,570
Where did you get this here jag?

768
01:10:36,904 --> 01:10:39,364
That's what I was tryin' to tell
you pappy. I found it the desert.

769
01:10:39,740 --> 01:10:42,701
Then why darn it did you
bring it here?

770
01:10:43,202 --> 01:10:46,288
Hold on! You're saying this here
jug was empty when you found it?

771
01:10:46,830 --> 01:10:49,124
- Aha, that's right!
- Nah, I don't believe a word of him!

772
01:10:49,541 --> 01:10:51,293
- Let's hang him, sheriff.
- Spring him up!

773
01:10:51,710 --> 01:10:54,463
- Who would take the water into
the desert? - Wouldn't be the first time...

774
01:10:55,047 --> 01:10:57,633
It's a puzzle!
Like a bit of mammagram!

775
01:10:58,050 --> 01:11:00,802
- What's goin' on sheriff?
- I don't know.

776
01:11:01,220 --> 01:11:04,848
But I'm gonna strip away this mystery
and expose its private parts!

777
01:11:05,390 --> 01:11:07,476
You and your kin are
comin' with me.

778
01:11:11,188 --> 01:11:12,981
They're coming.

779
01:11:13,315 --> 01:11:14,483
Here they come.

780
01:11:15,818 --> 01:11:17,820
Looks like they caught
the robbers.

781
01:11:40,592 --> 01:11:42,302
Where's the water?

782
01:11:44,805 --> 01:11:47,474
There weren't no water.

783
01:12:00,696 --> 01:12:03,073
Where is he going?

784
01:12:03,657 --> 01:12:06,910
He's going to see the Mayor...

785
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:12,040
- Aaa... he's gotta be pleased with
that, yeah! - That's a good one, boss.

786
01:12:22,342 --> 01:12:24,052
Interesting...

787
01:12:24,428 --> 01:12:26,597
I do apologize for the shoes,
Mr. Rango,

788
01:12:26,972 --> 01:12:32,436
but there's certain protocol to this game.
And I'm a bit of strict for protocol.

789
01:12:32,644 --> 01:12:37,191
That's good. 'Cause you gotta few questions
answering, and I got my own protocol.

790
01:12:42,112 --> 01:12:44,615
But why would anyone dump water
in the bloomin' desert?

791
01:12:44,823 --> 01:12:48,285
It does seem a bit naive taking
the word of admitted bank robbers.

792
01:12:48,494 --> 01:12:51,413
Besides, once they hanged,
your job is done.

793
01:12:51,872 --> 01:12:53,832
- Bravo!
- Job well done!

794
01:12:54,249 --> 01:12:56,752
But what if someone did rob the
bank before they got there?

795
01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:00,672
- And who would do that, Mr. Rango?
- I was hoping that you could tell me.

796
01:13:01,215 --> 01:13:03,842
That sounds marshally
near to an accusation.

797
01:13:04,259 --> 01:13:06,011
Take it anyway you like it.

798
01:13:11,475 --> 01:13:14,728
Something you said keeps
rattling 'round my frontal lobe.

799
01:13:15,062 --> 01:13:16,939
What's that?

800
01:13:17,564 --> 01:13:21,401
"Control the water,
and you control everything."

801
01:13:21,944 --> 01:13:26,323
Come on, Mr. Rango!
You tribute divine power to me!

802
01:13:26,782 --> 01:13:30,452
How on Earth could I possibly
control the water?

803
01:13:32,079 --> 01:13:38,794
- You obviously mastered this game.
- Well... I've been playing it for many years.

804
01:13:39,086 --> 01:13:42,047
I was here before the highway
split this great valley.

805
01:13:42,589 --> 01:13:47,845
I watched the march of progress.
And I learned a thing or two.

806
01:13:48,345 --> 01:13:51,682
Perhaps it's time you started
to take a long view.

807
01:13:51,932 --> 01:13:55,727
You'd begin to appreciate the
broad sweep of history.

808
01:13:56,103 --> 01:14:02,651
Look out there, son. You can
almost see time passing.

809
01:14:04,194 --> 01:14:09,867
What're you building out here?
Future, Mr. Rango, future.

810
01:14:10,325 --> 01:14:13,579
One day soon, all this is going to
faint into myth.

811
01:14:13,996 --> 01:14:16,623
The frontier town, the lawmen,
the gunslinger...

812
01:14:17,833 --> 01:14:21,128
There's just no place for them
anymore. We're civilized now.

813
01:14:21,628 --> 01:14:23,172
That's right, civilized.

814
01:14:23,380 --> 01:14:25,048
That's what the future holds.

815
01:14:25,465 --> 01:14:28,427
You can either be part of it
or you can be left behind.

816
01:14:28,969 --> 01:14:32,598
Is that what happened to Mr. Merrimack?
Did he get left behind?

817
01:14:33,015 --> 01:14:36,894
Careful, Mr. Rango. You seem to
forget you're just one little lizard.

818
01:14:37,394 --> 01:14:41,857
You seem to forget,
I'm the law 'round these parts.

819
01:14:43,609 --> 01:14:46,778
Our new sheriff's been playing
the hero for so long

820
01:14:47,112 --> 01:14:49,406
he has actually started
to believe it.

821
01:14:49,823 --> 01:14:52,242
Call in Rattlesnake Jake.

822
01:14:52,701 --> 01:14:56,788
Jake's the Grim Reaper. He'll never
leave a rat without ruining his soul!

823
01:14:57,164 --> 01:14:59,541
Do it!

824
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:17,476
Now be still. You gotta look presentable.
Going to meet your Maker.

825
01:15:17,976 --> 01:15:26,401
<i>La muerte allegado,
death has arrived.</i>

826
01:15:27,486 --> 01:15:35,536
<i>Como estanto suevos?
How will the hero survive?</i>

827
01:15:39,164 --> 01:15:44,628
The Mayor has bought all of the
land in the valley. Except yours, Miss Beans.

828
01:15:45,045 --> 01:15:49,007
That just don't make no sense.
Without water, that land is useless.

829
01:15:49,508 --> 01:15:53,262
Unless he controls the water!
Like a monkey's bladder!

830
01:15:53,762 --> 01:15:56,056
Then he can bring it back once
he bought up all the land.

831
01:15:56,390 --> 01:15:58,392
And then how does he control
the water?

832
01:15:58,934 --> 01:16:01,186
Sheriff, we got a problem.

833
01:16:07,442 --> 01:16:11,363
Hold on, Beans,
that won't be necessary.

834
01:16:14,783 --> 01:16:17,411
- Hang them!
- Tear them apart!

835
01:16:18,370 --> 01:16:19,788
Calm down.
Calm down!

836
01:16:20,914 --> 01:16:22,791
Let them pay the price!

837
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,585
We can smack down
their gimmicks!

838
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:26,962
You too, Spoons?

839
01:16:27,337 --> 01:16:30,048
They're done taking that water.
They'd taken everything we got.

840
01:16:30,507 --> 01:16:32,467
No one to hang anyone up.
Not while I'm the sheriff.

841
01:16:32,801 --> 01:16:34,344
But it's all his fault!

842
01:16:34,678 --> 01:16:36,722
You said you was going
to bring the water...

843
01:16:37,181 --> 01:16:41,435
- It's just we got no hope without that water.
- We got nothing left to believe.

844
01:16:41,810 --> 01:16:44,771
You see that sign up there?

845
01:16:45,355 --> 01:16:47,274
As long as that sign says "sheriff"!

846
01:16:47,983 --> 01:16:50,027
You can believe there's law
and order in this town!

847
01:16:50,402 --> 01:16:52,738
But without law and order!
Luminate on that!

848
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:57,075
Oh, yeah! Starts out slow...
like a... fungus.

849
01:16:57,826 --> 01:17:00,120
Somebody says a cross word,
accusations start climbin'...

850
01:17:00,329 --> 01:17:02,664
neighbour turn on neighbour,
pretty soon we're eating our children

851
01:17:03,081 --> 01:17:05,501
and dogs and cats will get together
to create all sorts

852
01:17:05,584 --> 01:17:06,710
of unnatural mutant aberations!

853
01:17:08,629 --> 01:17:11,340
So you want something to
believe in, Spoons?

854
01:17:12,090 --> 01:17:14,343
Believe in me.

855
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:17,930
Believe in that sign.

856
01:17:18,388 --> 01:17:22,100
As long as it hangs there,
we got hope.

857
01:17:47,209 --> 01:17:50,170
Hello, "brother".

858
01:17:50,587 --> 01:17:52,881
Thirsty?

859
01:18:02,724 --> 01:18:05,519
Long time, brother.

860
01:18:05,978 --> 01:18:11,441
- How've you been keeping?
- Oh, well, you know...

861
01:18:11,984 --> 01:18:16,029
I heard all that turnabout how you
killed all them Jenkins brothers.

862
01:18:16,572 --> 01:18:18,866
With one bullet, wasn't it?

863
01:18:19,199 --> 01:18:21,493
Isn't that right?

864
01:18:21,994 --> 01:18:25,747
All these good folks here believed
your little stories, don't they?

865
01:18:26,039 --> 01:18:30,210
Why, they believe you're
just a stone killer, don't they?

866
01:18:30,419 --> 01:18:33,130
Seems these folks trust you.

867
01:18:33,422 --> 01:18:35,966
They think you're gonna
save their little town.

868
01:18:36,341 --> 01:18:41,930
They think you're gonna
save their little souls.

869
01:18:43,182 --> 01:18:46,143
But we know better.
Don't we?

870
01:18:53,025 --> 01:18:56,778
So why don't you show your friends
here what you're made of?

871
01:18:57,112 --> 01:18:59,823
Show 'em who you really are.

872
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:02,993
Why don't you just pull your
gun and shoot me?

873
01:19:03,327 --> 01:19:05,662
But of course, you won't need
all the bean...

874
01:19:06,038 --> 01:19:09,458
Just one, right?

875
01:19:09,625 --> 01:19:14,713
Go ahead, hero.
Pull the trigger.

876
01:19:15,631 --> 01:19:19,009
You got killer in
your eyes, son?

877
01:19:20,093 --> 01:19:22,471
I don't see it.

878
01:19:24,556 --> 01:19:30,270
You didn't do any of them things you said?
You didn't kill Jenkins brothers?

879
01:19:30,687 --> 01:19:33,857
You ain't even from the West, are you?

880
01:19:34,191 --> 01:19:36,235
Say it!

881
01:19:36,693 --> 01:19:41,156
- No. - O, speak up. I don't think
your friends here heard you.

882
01:19:43,325 --> 01:19:49,373
- No. - All you done is lied to these good people.
You ain't nothing but a freak and a coward.

883
01:19:49,706 --> 01:19:52,125
Isn't that right?

884
01:19:52,334 --> 01:19:58,298
- Yes. - Louder!
- Yes.

885
01:19:58,507 --> 01:20:04,054
Listen closely, you pathetic fraud.
This is my town.

886
01:20:05,347 --> 01:20:09,768
If I ever see you again, I'll take
your soul straight down to hell!

887
01:20:25,576 --> 01:20:27,578
Who are you?

888
01:22:24,611 --> 01:22:27,156
<i>Who am I?</i>

889
01:22:28,157 --> 01:22:30,576
<i>I am nobody.</i>

890
01:24:23,772 --> 01:24:27,401
Golden guardians!

891
01:24:27,609 --> 01:24:30,654
The alabaster carriage!

892
01:24:34,950 --> 01:24:37,619
The Spirit of the West!

893
01:24:41,623 --> 01:24:43,000
Excuse me... Mister...
Spirit? Sir?

894
01:24:47,004 --> 01:24:50,340
Aaa... here's the beauty.
Sometimes you gotta dig deep

895
01:24:50,674 --> 01:24:53,969
to find what you're
looking for.

896
01:24:54,219 --> 01:24:56,472
So you made it...

897
01:24:57,055 --> 01:24:59,224
Is this Heaven?

898
01:24:59,516 --> 01:25:02,561
If it were, we'd be eating
Pop-Tarts with Kim Novak.

899
01:25:02,769 --> 01:25:05,105
Yea... ha... no kidding?

900
01:25:06,356 --> 01:25:09,651
- What are you doing out here?
- Searching... same as you.

901
01:25:11,653 --> 01:25:14,615
I don't even know what I'm
looking for.

902
01:25:14,907 --> 01:25:15,991
I don't even know who I am.

903
01:25:16,158 --> 01:25:18,911
And they used to call you
"The Man with Name".

904
01:25:19,328 --> 01:25:22,748
These days, they gotta a name
for just about everything.

905
01:25:23,123 --> 01:25:27,169
It doesn't matter what they call you,
it's the deeds, that make the man.

906
01:25:27,711 --> 01:25:31,089
But my deeds just made things worse.
I'm a fraud. I'm a phoney!

907
01:25:31,423 --> 01:25:35,344
My friends believed in me, but
they need some kinda hero...

908
01:25:35,719 --> 01:25:39,389
- Then be a hero.
- No, no, no, you don't understand.

909
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:42,434
- I'm not even supposed
to be here. - That's right.

910
01:25:42,768 --> 01:25:46,605
You came a long way to find
something that isn't out here.

911
01:25:46,897 --> 01:25:50,067
Don't you see?
It's not about you.

912
01:25:50,442 --> 01:25:53,779
It's about them.

913
01:25:54,988 --> 01:26:00,452
- But I can't go back... - You don't
know that you gotta choice, son.

914
01:26:02,538 --> 01:26:07,334
No man can walk out
on his own story.

915
01:26:17,719 --> 01:26:20,764
So, you made it.

916
01:26:21,098 --> 01:26:25,477
That's right, amigo.
The other side of the road.

917
01:26:27,187 --> 01:26:30,440
Did you just see that?

918
01:26:30,816 --> 01:26:37,239
We all see what we need to see.
Beautiful, isn't it?

919
01:26:48,125 --> 01:26:51,879
Yes... It is.

920
01:26:52,296 --> 01:26:56,592
Come, my friend.
I want to show you something.

921
01:26:59,386 --> 01:27:04,433
Many years ago, this entire valley
was covered in agua.

922
01:27:05,642 --> 01:27:08,562
Now... only one question remains:

923
01:27:09,646 --> 01:27:11,732
Where did it go?

924
01:27:46,683 --> 01:27:48,936
They follow the water.

925
01:27:49,269 --> 01:27:52,523
They follow the water!
Come on!

926
01:28:27,599 --> 01:28:32,354
<i>It just don't make no sense.
Without water, that land is useless.</i>

927
01:28:32,729 --> 01:28:34,898
<i>What are you building
out there?</i>

928
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:37,442
<i>The future, Mr. Rango.</i>

929
01:28:37,818 --> 01:28:42,447
<i>You can either be part of it,
or you can be left behind.</i>

930
01:28:43,615 --> 01:28:47,744
<i>I was here before the highway
split this great valley.</i>

931
01:28:49,329 --> 01:28:54,710
<i>I watched the march of progress.
And I learned a thing or two.</i>

932
01:28:59,756 --> 01:29:04,887
<i>Control the water,
and you'll control everything.</i>

933
01:29:12,227 --> 01:29:16,482
<i>Come, now, Mr. Rango!
You tribute divine power to me!</i>

934
01:29:16,773 --> 01:29:21,153
<i>How on Earth could I
possibly control the water?</i>

935
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:49,807
EMMERGENCY SHUT OFF
VALVE 6

936
01:29:55,145 --> 01:29:58,190
What now, amigo?

937
01:30:04,822 --> 01:30:08,367
No man can walk out
of his own story.

938
01:30:09,368 --> 01:30:10,994
I'm going back.

939
01:30:11,662 --> 01:30:12,371
But why?

940
01:30:14,081 --> 01:30:17,543
Because that's who I am.

941
01:30:28,762 --> 01:30:34,017
You gotta lot of nerve showing up
here, lawman! What do you want?

942
01:30:34,226 --> 01:30:36,645
Your pappy and them boys are
'bout to hang for something

943
01:30:37,062 --> 01:30:40,691
they didn't do. But I have a plan.

944
01:31:09,261 --> 01:31:12,431
I appreciate how difficult this is
for you, Beans.

945
01:31:12,764 --> 01:31:15,058
But you're making a practical decision.

946
01:31:15,267 --> 01:31:17,436
Decisions... Decisions...

947
01:31:17,895 --> 01:31:21,148
There is no need
for any more suffering...

948
01:31:27,738 --> 01:31:31,617
Your family's ranch is nothing
but a wasteland now.

949
01:31:32,075 --> 01:31:38,081
Sign the deed and relieve yourself
of your father's burden.

950
01:31:38,540 --> 01:31:41,335
My daddy was not a burden!

951
01:31:41,752 --> 01:31:45,380
Keep your blood money,
and I'll keep my land!

952
01:31:49,635 --> 01:31:52,888
Do what he says or by all
the fires of the black pit

953
01:31:53,263 --> 01:31:57,559
I'll squeeze them pretty brown
eyes right out of your skull!

954
01:31:57,935 --> 01:32:01,438
- Now, hold on, Jake, there's no need...
- Let me do my job!

955
01:32:01,730 --> 01:32:05,526
You brought me here now we're
gonna play this sling out to the end.

956
01:32:06,109 --> 01:32:10,072
- Sign the damn paper, woman!
- Go to hell!

957
01:32:10,489 --> 01:32:13,325
Where do you think
I come from?

958
01:32:13,867 --> 01:32:16,245
Look into my eyes...

959
01:32:16,578 --> 01:32:19,623
I wanna see you die!

960
01:32:22,793 --> 01:32:26,171
Jake!

961
01:32:28,048 --> 01:32:30,467
I'm calling you out!

962
01:32:31,885 --> 01:32:33,637
Jake!

963
01:32:34,221 --> 01:32:38,642
This day just got a
little more interesting.

964
01:33:05,419 --> 01:33:07,588
Put her down.

965
01:33:07,921 --> 01:33:10,257
Or what, little man?
You gonna kill me?

966
01:33:10,466 --> 01:33:14,094
That's just about the
size of it.

967
01:33:14,636 --> 01:33:17,598
- Get those filthy paws of me!
- Shut up your gob!

968
01:33:18,015 --> 01:33:21,393
All right, sheriff.
Make your move.

969
01:34:52,943 --> 01:34:55,571
Now, amigos!

970
01:34:59,032 --> 01:35:02,452
Pull! Pull!

971
01:35:19,052 --> 01:35:21,889
That was a bad idea.

972
01:35:25,559 --> 01:35:28,270
Thirsty, "Brother"?

973
01:35:31,815 --> 01:35:34,651
It's coming!

974
01:35:40,407 --> 01:35:43,243
- This is a miracle!
- Hold on!

975
01:35:50,125 --> 01:35:52,795
- Look, the water!
- What is that?

976
01:35:53,629 --> 01:35:55,380
It's our salvation, pappy!

977
01:35:55,923 --> 01:35:59,510
It's our jailway going out!
We're gonna escape!

978
01:36:09,228 --> 01:36:11,814
I'm gonna blow so many holes
in your body, you're be leaking led!

979
01:36:12,022 --> 01:36:15,108
Then it's a good thing
I brought some back-up.

980
01:36:15,859 --> 01:36:17,653
What?

981
01:36:30,457 --> 01:36:35,170
Ain't no hawk!
Ain't nothing but bats!

982
01:36:37,339 --> 01:36:40,717
Stick to the plan boys!
Aim for his head!

983
01:36:52,855 --> 01:36:56,984
- It only takes one bullet.
- You ain't got the nerve!

984
01:36:57,985 --> 01:37:00,112
Try me.

985
01:37:04,283 --> 01:37:08,662
Oh, Mr. Rango... aren't you
forgetting something?

986
01:37:13,458 --> 01:37:17,379
Hand me your gun, sheriff.

987
01:37:18,255 --> 01:37:21,467
Now, Mr. Rango!

988
01:37:32,352 --> 01:37:35,063
Beans, hold on!
Don't worry! I've got a plan!

989
01:37:35,814 --> 01:37:39,943
Help!
Open the door!

990
01:37:40,736 --> 01:37:42,613
OK, plan B.

991
01:37:43,363 --> 01:37:45,449
What? Beans,
you're mumbling!

992
01:37:46,200 --> 01:37:49,703
All my problems are taken
care of. Except for one.

993
01:37:50,245 --> 01:37:53,749
It's a new West, Jake, there is
no room for gunslingers any more.

994
01:37:54,208 --> 01:37:57,878
- We're businessmen now.
- We got new hats.

995
01:37:58,295 --> 01:38:01,924
Where I come from, we call
this improvisation.

996
01:38:02,549 --> 01:38:05,093
You're came back!

997
01:38:12,851 --> 01:38:14,478
What was that!?

998
01:38:14,812 --> 01:38:19,358
- No need to panic! But I think you just
swallowed our plan B. - What?

999
01:38:19,942 --> 01:38:21,777
OK... panic time.

1000
01:38:22,194 --> 01:38:26,031
You and the sheriff are more alike
than you think. Nothing but legends.

1001
01:38:26,490 --> 01:38:31,286
Pretty soon no one will believe
you've even existed.

1002
01:38:33,247 --> 01:38:36,291
One last bullet to kill the
one last outlaw.

1003
01:38:37,709 --> 01:38:40,671
How fitting!

1004
01:39:14,705 --> 01:39:18,625
Sheriff, I'm sure if we work together,
we can reach mutually beneficial

1005
01:39:19,001 --> 01:39:24,631
- solution to our current situation.
- You better take it up with him.

1006
01:39:34,558 --> 01:39:37,269
One bullet...

1007
01:39:37,728 --> 01:39:40,355
I tip my hat to you.

1008
01:39:40,814 --> 01:39:44,943
As one legend to another.

1009
01:39:45,235 --> 01:39:47,654
What was that you say?

1010
01:39:48,030 --> 01:39:53,535
Pretty soon no one will believe
you've even existed?

1011
01:40:06,465 --> 01:40:12,763
Rango! You brought the water back.
Just like you promised.

1012
01:40:13,138 --> 01:40:15,265
You really are a hero...

1013
01:40:15,474 --> 01:40:20,813
- Well, thing about heroes is, whenever you...
- Don't spoil...

1014
01:40:21,480 --> 01:40:24,858
Well I don't know about you,
but I could sure go for a dip!

1015
01:40:28,237 --> 01:40:31,865
<i>And so the lizard completes
his journey.</i>

1016
01:40:32,407 --> 01:40:35,619
<i>From the humble beginnings to the
legend we sing of today.</i>

1017
01:40:36,078 --> 01:40:40,249
<i>And although, he's certain to die.
Perhaps from... er... household accident!</i>

1018
01:40:40,582 --> 01:40:43,335
<i>Which account for 65 % all
unatural deaths.</i>

1019
01:40:43,627 --> 01:40:47,256
<i>The people of the village will
always remember</i>

1020
01:40:47,548 --> 01:40:50,467
<i>the name of the ONE
who saved them.</i>

1021
01:40:50,759 --> 01:40:52,761
<i>Rango!</i>
