1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,480
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,760
I'm arresting you
for the murder of the boy

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,920
you blew up under
the Crown Point bridge.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,800
And how can you help me?

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,200
What do you say, Pal?

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,560
You need a smile.

7
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,080
I'm not who my parents
might've wanted me to be.

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,800
- And I'm okay with that.
- I'm not okay with it.

9
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,640
I went to my lawyer to had them
drop emancipation papers.

10
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,920
Alfred, you're fired!

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,760
Now get the hell out of my house.

12
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,360
I am in control!

13
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,720
But why would you want that?

14
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,840
We had so much fun when we were me.

15
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,480
Surprise.

16
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,040
I needed the police
to turn on Penguin

17
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,400
So you sent this monster
to my city?

18
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,240
I need you at the head
of the GCPD.

19
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,000
Let them think you're a hero.

20
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,080
Mrs. Gordon.
I just shot and killed the pig.

21
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,640
Ivy?

22
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,720
What happened to you?

23
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,240
I've been reborn.

24
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,880
And I will never be underestimated
or ignored ever again.

25
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,960
Let's make Gotham our bitch.

26
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,960
Can I help you?

27
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,080
You're so beautiful.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,360
Thanks. Now move.

29
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,600
Yeah, let me tell him.

30
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,960
Oh, my God, you're gonna love this.

31
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,480
- Let me just tell him.
- Wait, no. Can I tell him?

32
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,360
- Just let me tell him.
- Nice score.

33
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,720
Cindy? Who are these...

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,560
Well, what a charming young lady.

35
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,960
- She's so beautiful, mom.
- It's cool.

36
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,040
So, your perfume turn people
into your super fans?

37
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,960
Like all good things, it'll fade.

38
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,720
But until then, they're mine.

39
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,520
Freeze.

40
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,840
Not bad.

41
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,440
I'll check out the rest of the house.

42
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,400
My friend thinks
we're here to rob you.

43
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,240
But I know who you work for
Roland Charles PhD.

44
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:53,840
How you torture plants
in the name of science.

45
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,800
Do you ever wonder
how those plants feel?

46
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,760
Soon...

47
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,160
you'll share more with them
than you ever could've imagined.

48
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,680
What did you do to him?

49
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,560
I gave him what he deserves.

50
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,520
{\an5}Captain. Captain Gordon. Yoohoo.

51
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,600
{\an5}Captain. Captain Gordon.
Chaz Carmichael

52
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,320
{\an5}Congratulations.

53
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,360
{\an5}Boss ain't gonna be happy
I'm in here.

54
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,880
{\an5}Let's say I got a lot
of responsibility

55
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,040
{\an5}in my organization.

56
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,320
{\an5}Well, you seem like a real
responsible guy.

57
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,360
{\an5}My boss is Sofia Falcone.

58
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,680
{\an5}Oh, yeah?
What's that got to do with me?

59
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,840
Easy.

60
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,040
{\an5}Well, I know she told me
if I ever got pinched

61
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,920
{\an5}to tell you to give her a call.

62
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,760
- Is that so?
- You can't do this.

63
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,240
- I got rights.
- Oh, yeah?

64
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,280
{\an5}How about you exercise your right
to remain silent?

65
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,200
{\an5}Hey, Cap.

66
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,840
{\an5}Got something.

67
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,200
{\an5}Victim was Roland Charles

68
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,920
{\an5}were an RnD
Wayne Enterprises Biotech.

69
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,560
{\an5}Did you know him
from any work to Wayne?

70
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,800
{\an5}I met him in passing, not that
I recognize him right away.

71
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,960
{\an5}It's like the twig
we found last week.

72
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,080
{\an5}The toxin entered the bloodstream
through the cuts on the neck.

73
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,600
{\an5}If it is the same as the last victim.

74
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,400
{\an5}The toxin creates vines
that feed off in the victim's body.

75
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:12,520
{\an5}while also attacking the hippocampus
like some plant-based psychedelics.

76
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,080
{\an5}So it kills you
and makes you hallucinate.

77
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,720
{\an5}Any witnesses?

78
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,640
{\an5}The family saying
it was two women.

79
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,880
{\an5}Redhead and a brunette?

80
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,160
{\an5}The redhead used some kind
of hypnosis on them.

81
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,080
{\an5}The brunette wore leather whip.

82
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,600
{\an5}Selina Kyle?

83
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,720
{\an5}Murder's not really her thing.

84
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,920
{\an5}The family says
the redhead killed Roland.

85
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,400
She left with his briefcase.

86
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,240
{\an5}Well, if his briefcase is missing

87
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,800
maybe this is related
to his work at Wayne Biotech?

88
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,160
{\an5}Doubtful.
He oversaw standard projects.

89
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,520
{\an5}Pharmaceuticals, pesticides.

90
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,800
What?

91
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,280
Nothing.

92
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,240
{\an5}I'll track down Selina.

93
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,440
<i>This is Bruce. Leave a message.</i>

94
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,240
Bruce, I know we haven't talked
in a while

95
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,240
but someone just killed
Roland Charles.

96
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,120
We may have a problem.

97
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,520
Roland Charles asked for clearance

98
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,400
for some top secret
biotech experiment.

99
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,840
Project M.

100
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,720
Ivy, do you think
I care about that?

101
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,240
You just killed a man
in front of his family.

102
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,440
He had it coming.

103
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,200
You have no idea
what these people do.

104
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,600
We need to find out everything
we can about Project M.

105
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,720
And whatever it is

106
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,360
all access would've had
to have been approved

107
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,440
by Bruce Wayne.

108
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,840
You know I... I... I really thought

109
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,640
that doing a crime spree with you
would be fun

110
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,720
but I was wrong.

111
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,480
- Selina!
- Leave me alone.

112
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,400
Enjoy your shrubs.

113
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,920
We don't need her.

114
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,560
Now let's show everyone
just how strong we are.

115
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,840
Pour me another shot.

116
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,280
Pour me another shot.

117
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,360
Party time. Party time.

118
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,560
Gonna throw up.

119
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,800
Gonna throw up.

120
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,080
You know, I've had some crazy nights

121
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,080
but I've never bought a talking bird.

122
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,080
Sorry. Party's over.

123
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,480
I was not at the party.

124
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,240
I've seen you before.

125
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,040
At the Sirens. What are you...
what are you doing here?

126
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,320
I'm here

127
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,600
to speak for those who can't
speak for themselves, Bruce.

128
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm here to speak for the plants.

129
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,800
Okay.

130
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,560
My head hurts.

131
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,360
Please get out.

132
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,560
First.

133
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,520
Tell me about Project M.

134
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,400
How do you know about that?

135
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,400
You know, I know a lot of things...

136
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
billionaire boy.

137
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,760
Ivy?

138
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,840
You're so...

139
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,160
beautiful.

140
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,240
Now Project M.

141
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,240
Hi, there.

142
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,480
Giddy up!

143
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,440
Is this seat taken?

144
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,200
If I say yes
would it make a difference?

145
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,720
You know, I've always been a fan

146
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,960
when you got locked up
in this loony bin

147
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,920
I expected great things.

148
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,680
Murder or two. Maybe a...

149
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,640
prison break.

150
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:54,720
But all you've done is mope
for the last six weeks.

151
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,840
You must know I cannot escape.

152
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,200
Why?

153
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,600
None of your business.

154
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,360
Because Sofia Falcone's holding
someone important to me captive

155
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,160
and if I escape, she will kill him.

156
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,800
Wow, what a boring story.

157
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:20,320
If there's one thing I can't stand
it's someone boring.

158
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,720
The last person who bored me
was Deidric.

159
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,880
- Deidric.
- I had to sneak into

160
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,320
his shock therapy session
and boost the juice.

161
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,480
Now he pees himself
10 times a day and sometimes...

162
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,280
poos himself.

163
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,480
Well, that's very sad.

164
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,440
I'm gonna cure you this attitude,
Oswald.

165
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:00,120
I'm gonna find that entertaining guy
I know is inside of you.

166
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,760
And when I do ooh...

167
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,480
we are gonna have
so much fun together.

168
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,320
Alright?

169
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,120
That's quite a story.

170
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,640
Not what I was expecting.

171
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,880
You're just so easy to talk to.

172
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,600
Normally, I would make this quick,
like I did with Roland.

173
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,960
But it's your name

174
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,080
on the company
that murders my little green friends.

175
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,920
I'm so sorry, Ivy.

176
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,360
I would never want to upset you.

177
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,240
But you have, Bruce.

178
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,760
I know what you really want.

179
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,720
Bury your head in the sand.

180
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,480
You're still guilty.

181
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,800
It will be slow.

182
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,920
And it will be painful.

183
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,240
But it's what you deserve.

184
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,640
I'm just sorry I won't be here
to see you bloom.

185
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,400
Nope.

186
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,200
Nope.

187
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,280
No.

188
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,640
None of this will do.

189
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,080
Where's Ivy?

190
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,040
What is she doing to me, where am I?

191
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,880
- Just the thing.
- Ra's al Ghul?

192
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,960
Ra's al Ghul.
Nope, never heard of him.

193
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,240
I'm Dr. Greenthumb.

194
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,480
Just here to do
a little light pruning, really.

195
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,840
No!

196
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,080
No!

197
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,680
No!

198
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,400
There.

199
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,760
That's better.

200
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,720
Mummy always used to say.

201
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,000
a little pruning encourages growth.

202
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,360
Where are you taking that?

203
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,600
Thanks, poppet.

204
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,400
Where are you taking my face?

205
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,560
Please, what's happening to me?

206
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,560
My dear boy.

207
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,040
You're dying.

208
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,120
Just hold still
while I put this in place.

209
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,240
Good lord.

210
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,680
Jim. What a pleasant surprise.

211
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,800
- I'm looking for Selina.
- Haven't seen her.

212
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,880
She's more of an alley cat
than a house cat.

213
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,760
Now I'm just in the middle...
Let him in.

214
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,080
Hello, James. It's been a while.

215
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,600
Barbara, can you give us a moment?

216
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,240
Sure.

217
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,520
Have fun, lovebird.

218
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,640
What is your business
with Barbara Kean?

219
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,040
You worried that I told her
about our arrangement?

220
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,960
I know how to keep a secret.

221
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:50,480
Now, I want my man, Carmichael,
released from GCPD custody.

222
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,880
That wasn't the deal.

223
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,440
You run the underworld,
I run the GCPD

224
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:57,080
your guy got arrested.
That's on him.

225
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,240
Let me make something clear...

226
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,240
our deal is whatever I say it is.

227
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,680
Unless you want people to know

228
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,160
you're responsible
for bringing the Pyg to town.

229
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,520
You brought him to Gotham
I was just trying to stop Penguin.

230
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,160
But, you covered it up
and took credit for killing him.

231
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,440
Word gets out, you're destroyed.

232
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,040
Along with your beloved GCPD.

233
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,280
And if I go down...

234
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,920
so will you.

235
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,040
And I think you like being
the Queen of the underworld.

236
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,520
You still think you know
what I will and won't do.

237
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,240
I know a bluff when I see one.

238
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,640
I have a job to do.

239
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,360
Selena!

240
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,160
Oh, hey Jim. I found Selena,
she went that way.

241
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,280
No! No! No!

242
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,720
Shut it, Penguin.

243
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,520
No! No!

244
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Don't!

245
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,720
- What do you want?
- I told you Pengy.

246
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,160
I'm gonna cure you
of the sad-sack mopey act.

247
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,640
And the best cure,
is the laughing cure.

248
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,240
Make me laugh.

249
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,760
Make him laugh! Make him laugh!

250
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,080
So, what are you be performing?

251
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,080
Contortionism,
juggling act, the tight five?

252
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,520
What's that?

253
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,800
You want to do a clown dance?

254
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,720
- Yeah!
- Wonderful.

255
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,560
I will not!

256
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,360
No.

257
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,240
I refuse it! No!

258
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:57,160
Make him dance! Make him dance!
Make him dance!

259
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,480
In your own time.

260
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,480
You have no idea how I have suffered.

261
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,760
The betrayals I've been do into.
Just leave me alone.

262
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,040
- Leave me alone.
- Cut!

263
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,440
Oswald, Oswald, Oswald.

264
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:27,960
You are trapped in a prison. In here.

265
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:32,680
And I'm offering you the key. So...

266
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,600
- dance.
- Make him dance!

267
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,440
Make him dance! Make him dance!

268
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,360
Now we're talking.

269
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,160
So I can feel funny from it.
Here it come.

270
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,200
Here comes the bunny. Okay.

271
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,840
Afraid to stare you are not.

272
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,480
We'll try again tomorrow.

273
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,320
What the hell, man?

274
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,720
Why were you running Selena?

275
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,640
'Cause a jerk with badge
was chasing me.

276
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,000
So not because you're in roll
in Charles' house last night

277
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,640
when he was turned into a tree?

278
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,720
His family saw
a redhead and a brunette

279
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,080
the brunette was carrying
a leather whip, just like yours

280
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,280
tell me I'm crazy.

281
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,360
I swear, I was only there
to rob the place.

282
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,840
So what about the redhead?

283
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,840
She kill some tweaker
in the narrow the same way.

284
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,080
I need a name.

285
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,200
Ivy Pepper.

286
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,040
Try again, I know Ivy.

287
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,440
No, Gordon, she's changed.
Like a lot.

288
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:55,480
She can use plant to hypnotize people
and poison them.

289
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,320
So why'd she want to kill Roland?

290
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,240
'Cause he work for Wayne Enterprises.

291
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,720
Wayne Enterprise?

292
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,600
She's obsessed with the super-secret
project they're doing.

293
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,120
I know she's lying.
Come on, let's go.

294
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,520
Admiring my handiwork?

295
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,440
Excuse me?

296
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,160
Look how beautiful he became.

297
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,080
And all it took...

298
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,280
was a little...

299
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,280
scratch.

300
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,440
What do you want from me?

301
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,880
I want to know about Project M.

302
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,560
What is Project M?

303
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,680
Bruce Wayne told me everything.

304
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,560
Now, he didn't even trust himself
with the location

305
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,280
but then you know where it is.

306
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,680
And you're going to take me to it.

307
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,680
But first...

308
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,200
you probably want to tell me
I'm beautiful.

309
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,760
Yes.

310
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,600
No!

311
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,360
Help! Somebody, help me!

312
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,520
Jim. Jim, I need you to help me.

313
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,640
Looks like you got yourself shaving,
old man.

314
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,400
Jim, it's me, it's Bruce.

315
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,920
I'm Bruce Wayne.

316
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,880
Honey, I think we'd know
if you are Bruce Wayne.

317
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,760
He's the one throwing this shindig.

318
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,440
That's him, younger.

319
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,760
Bruce, you're incorrigible.
I may have bust a gut.

320
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,360
Luckily, I am a doctor.

321
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,560
I need the guest pajamas.

322
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,600
Come on.

323
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:11,040
Easy there, sport.
It's Italian Velvet.

324
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,040
What did you do?
Where's Ra's al Ghul?

325
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,200
Ra's al who?

326
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,480
It's my face. He gave you my face!
That's my face!

327
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,400
I think you've been hitting the gin.

328
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,120
Give me back my face!
I'm Bruce Wayne!

329
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,880
Get off of me! You ruining my mind!

330
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,880
Everything all right, Master Bruce?

331
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,560
Yes, thank you.

332
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,240
Just getting rid of a riffraff.

333
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,920
Dude, what is it with you
and arm grabbing?

334
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,840
Harper, I need keys to lockup,
and is Lucius in his office.

335
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,480
Lucius? No, he left with Ivy
a little while ago.

336
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,880
- Ivy Pepper? She was here?
- Yeah.

337
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,960
She asked me
to introduce her to everyone.

338
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,640
Doesn't she the coolest?

339
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,720
She's a psycho who turn a guy
into a potted plant.

340
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,000
What's going on with you?

341
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,080
Did he just say that Ivy is a psycho?

342
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,840
But Ivy is the best.

343
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,160
Is this the hypnosis
I've been hearing about?

344
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,440
I'm gonna say yeah.

345
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,760
Until it fades,
they'll do anything for her.

346
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,600
And think she's the coolest.

347
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,760
What do you mean by Ivy is a psycho?

348
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,600
Hold that thought, Harper.
We'll be right back.

349
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,920
You hear what the captain said
about Ivy?

350
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,840
- But Ivy is awesome.
- Yeah, she is the coolest.

351
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,160
No more! No more!

352
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,080
You have a visitor.

353
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,240
Hello, Oswald.

354
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,360
I see Arkham is treating you well.

355
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,320
I take that you're here to gloat.

356
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,640
You are correct.

357
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,320
And why not?

358
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,400
I'm in an insane asylum.

359
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,520
Being pummeled by lunatics.

360
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,920
Then again, at least I'm not a moron.

361
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,760
I may not be the man I once was...

362
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,680
but I have many things
that you do not have.

363
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,200
A purpose...

364
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,320
friends, your manifest.

365
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,720
And I wanted you to see that.

366
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,360
No.

367
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,120
I know who you are.

368
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,760
There's something else going on.

369
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,760
Something else brought you here.

370
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,840
There's nothing else.

371
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:00,000
I wanted you to see
how well I am doing.

372
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,840
And I wanted to see
how miserable you are.

373
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,520
Mission accomplished.

374
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,640
Ed...

375
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,960
I'm gonna be out of here soon.

376
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,920
And once I am...

377
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:17,640
I am going to wipe
that smile off your face.

378
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,280
Preferably with the chainsaw.

379
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,520
Now, how are you gonna do that?

380
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,840
You have no friends.

381
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,000
No one to help you escape.

382
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,000
You are utterly alone.

383
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,280
Goodbye, Oswald.

384
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:40,640
If I... if I don't put too much stuff
into your brain

385
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,440
you're just a simpleton!

386
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:01,200
<i>"I am held captive all day,
my brilliance locked away</i>

387
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:04,360
<i>this prison must be broken,
the key...</i>

388
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,000
<i>my name which must be spoken."</i>

389
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,600
You are still in there.

390
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,560
That's why you came.

391
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,320
You're still there.

392
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,360
And you gonna help me
find a way out of here.

393
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,720
Hello, we should be leaving.

394
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,000
Not until we find out
where Ivy took Lucius.

395
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,560
There has to be something.

396
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,120
<i>You know where it is
and you are going to take me to it.</i>

397
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,040
<i>You're so incredible.</i>

398
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,800
<i>Where is project M?</i>

399
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,720
<i>Wayne Bio-Tech has a secret facility</i>

400
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,400
<i>outside the city
at the edge of Kane Park.</i>

401
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,120
Good man Lucius.

402
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,840
In here.

403
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,040
Hey, cap, the boys and I were talking

404
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,120
and we didn't really like

405
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,120
the way that you are talking
about Ivy.

406
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,000
I told you we should've left.

407
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:15,240
Look, I think you misinterpreted
what I was saying.

408
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,240
You called Ivy a psycho.

409
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,520
That's a term of endearment.

410
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,240
I love Ivy, I think she's great.

411
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,760
What about you?

412
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,680
Do you love Ivy?

413
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,640
Yeah, I love Ivy.

414
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,800
How much?

415
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,840
I love Ivy so much
that I wish I could be her.

416
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,720
You're not really selling it.

417
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,640
And you think you did?

418
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,200
Run.

419
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,720
Get them.

420
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,440
Selena!

421
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,280
All right, Oswald.
Old buddy, old pal.

422
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,760
Tonight we're gonna cure you.

423
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,160
Make me laugh or else.

424
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:25,160
Let's call this
the sudden death round.

425
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,120
Dietrich?

426
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,160
Okay, that was clever... ish.

427
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,560
Yeah, that's a spoon.

428
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,960
This is also a fork!

429
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,880
Looks like you got
some fire in you still.

430
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:59,320
But it just too little,
too late, too...

431
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,560
boring.

432
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,320
Lobotomized the little burn.

433
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,240
Wait! Wait.

434
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:09,640
You said,
this prison is all in my mind.

435
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,520
Maybe, I've been to prison right now.

436
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:18,560
A prison, where you can't get to me.

437
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,920
Okay.

438
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,520
You really are nuts.

439
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:29,720
Try laughing now you ginger sap!

440
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,400
Yes!

441
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,680
See? I told you I kill you!

442
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,520
Don't flatter yourself!

443
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,600
One more.

444
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,120
And so I said to the guy.
You wanna know what I said?

445
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,960
I said, what is this?
A three-ring circus?

446
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,320
And keep them coming.

447
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,480
How long do you think
you can hide in here?

448
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,080
Look.

449
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,440
Out there.

450
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,880
He's going to find you eventually.

451
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,920
I don't understand.
Who's gonna find me?

452
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,200
- Alfred?
- Special agent Pennyworth

453
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,080
to you too, scumbag.

454
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,000
Package secured,
requesting extraction.

455
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,000
No!

456
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,640
Just be careful here.

457
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,480
We to go this way.

458
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,320
This way.

459
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,040
So, this is it?

460
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,440
Project M.

461
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,960
Also called Lazarus Water.

462
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,480
It belongs to a man
known as Ra's al Ghul.

463
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:27,440
It stimulates cell growth
at an alarming rate.

464
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,600
We get to figure out how.

465
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:36,040
I assume Project M killed plants.
But it's the opposite.

466
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,120
Just like humans lock up
something so beautiful.

467
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,600
What do you gonna do with it?

468
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,120
I'm going to make miracles happen.

469
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,240
Release me!

470
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,720
Listen to me, I'm Bruce Wayne

471
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,320
I can pay you whatever you want,
you need to let me go, now!

472
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,200
Sorry, I can't do that more enough.

473
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,880
You see, I have a mission.

474
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,000
What mission?

475
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,240
For me to bring you to him.

476
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,960
What is that?

477
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,680
Oh, giddy up, son.

478
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,280
What do you want?

479
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,280
Why did you bring me here?

480
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,320
This is where my parents were killed!

481
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,480
No.

482
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,360
This is where I was born.

483
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,360
No!

484
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,080
That's far enough.

485
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,960
Jim Gordon.

486
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,200
Ivy Pepper?

487
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,520
It's been a long time.

488
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,360
I'm not the same kid you remember.

489
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:25,040
The kid whose father,
you and your partner killed

490
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,400
all those years ago?

491
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,560
How was this possible?

492
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,560
First, I was a seed...

493
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,000
then sprout...

494
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,720
now I've bloomed.

495
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,160
Drop your gun.

496
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:45,080
Or your friend Lucius
becomes a flower arrangement.

497
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,480
Lucius, you okay?

498
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,640
I'm in the sweet embrace of one
of my favorite people, Jim

499
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,920
never been better.

500
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,080
Now, I know you're tenacious.

501
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,800
Jim Gordon gun or no gun

502
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,720
you'll come after me.

503
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,600
But then...

504
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,320
Bruce Wayne will die.

505
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,840
What have you done to him?

506
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,120
I went to Wayne Manor
and planted a seed.

507
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,440
I imagine he's about to bloom.

508
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,960
But if you let me go...

509
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,600
he may have a chance...

510
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,560
to get him the antidote.

511
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,320
This isn't over.

512
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,080
You have no idea how right you are.

513
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,600
I love you.

514
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,080
Lucius, give me the antidote.

515
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,960
Let's just wait until
Ivy is at a safe distance.

516
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,520
Give me the antidote, come on.

517
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,160
- Don't make me hit you.
- Jim...

518
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:52,320
I must warn you,
I'm a black belt in Jiu-jitsu.

519
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,360
- Since when?
- Night classes.

520
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,760
- The Lazarus Water.
- Come on.

521
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,280
We gotta get to Bruce Wayne.

522
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,480
Help!

523
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,680
Somebody help!

524
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,720
Who's there?

525
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,200
Show yourself!

526
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,960
Who are you?

527
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:58,120
I am the one you cannot escape.

528
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,800
The one you cannot kill.

529
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,600
You're me.

530
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,400
- Please.
- You're scared.

531
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,960
You should be.

532
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,120
It's okay Bruce, it's all right.

533
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,120
You're safe now.

534
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,880
According to Lucius

535
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,920
Ivy's toxin attacks the brain
like hallucinogen.

536
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,680
So, whatever you went through

537
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,800
I doubt it was pleasant
but it wasn't real.

538
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,440
I think I saw who I really am.

539
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,120
I know what you're gonna say

540
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,400
but what I saw, it was real.

541
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,280
Well, then you're lucky.

542
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,840
Most people go their whole lives
not ever knowing who they really are.

543
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,000
I'm not lucky.

544
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,080
You didn't see it.

545
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,480
I've seen my own darkness.

546
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,920
I say this...

547
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:20,800
you have people around you
who care for you.

548
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,000
Don't fight this alone.

549
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,680
Trust us.

550
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,200
I'll leave men outside tonight.

551
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,000
I'll come by tomorrow,
check in on you.

552
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,360
Jim.

553
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,160
When I was under...

554
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,320
I saw you.

555
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,440
You had a mustache.

556
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,600
Well, clearly
that's a very dangerous toxin.

557
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,120
Alfred, it's...

558
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,440
it's me, it's Bruce, I...

559
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,960
I need your help, Alfred.

560
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,800
Please call me.

561
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,560
We're not hypnotized.

562
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,040
Just embarrassed.

563
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,920
Good to have you back.

564
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,600
All right, listen up!

565
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,600
I want an APB on Ivy Pepper.

566
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,680
Finding her is our top priority.

567
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,120
All right, you heard him people,
let's get to work.

568
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,080
- What do you want?
<i>- I thought about what you said.</i>

569
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,840
How if I use the pic
to destroy you

570
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,040
I'd also destroy myself.

571
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,440
<i>And?</i>

572
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,080
And, you're right.

573
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,960
I've come to enjoy
being the queen of Gotham.

574
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,320
Glad we understand each other.

575
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,040
Not quite, you see, I also realized
I don't need the pic.

576
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,200
There are other ways for me
to hurt you.

577
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,160
Thank you so much for coming.

578
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,680
Without we're overdue for a chat.

579
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,120
How could I say no
to my sister-in-law.

580
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,760
Cowards. Oh, I strangle them if...

581
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,120
Relax, buddy.

582
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,240
You gave me what I needed.

583
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,640
The laugh of the century.

584
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,840
Tell me something.

585
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:05,080
You appear to have
everyone here under your thumb.

586
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,520
The guards, the inmates...

587
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,680
What can I say,
I'm a charismatic guy.

588
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,400
You could escape anytime.

589
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,520
Why stay?

590
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,560
Why indeed?

591
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,240
- You're planning something.
- Righty-o, boy.

592
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:29,440
Something spectacular.

593
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,760
See, I'm in this funny form

594
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:34,120
because I need
to find the cram deal are crazy.

595
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,360
Which is why I need you.

596
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,920
You get it.

597
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,520
But when we're done

598
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,080
the world out there

599
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,360
that'll be the asylum.

600
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,560
What do you say?

601
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,520
Thank you for your kind offer.

602
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,240
I don't expect to be here very long.

603
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,840
You'll come around.

604
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,320
They always do.

605
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,320
Nope.

606
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,200
Where did these plants come from?

607
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,280
Get out.

608
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,240
Before we call the police.

609
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,840
Oh, friends,

610
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,280
you're all so beautiful.
