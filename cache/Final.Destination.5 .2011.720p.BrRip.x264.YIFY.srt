00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:49,570
<font color="#787878">Good morning, Presage employees.</font>

2
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:53,570
<font color="#787878">We hope you're all ready for our exciting team-building retreat.</font>

3
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:54,570
<font color="#787878">Please enjoy your breakfast....</font>

4
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:57,570
<font color="#787878">and then make your way to the bus, which will leave shortly.</font>

5
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,570
<font color="#787878">Hey, Sam, when I said, "Would you put breakfast together for the retreat?....</font>

6
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:03,570
<font color="#787878">I meant, like, some stale doughnuts, some coffee.</font>

7
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:05,570
<font color="#787878">But this is amazing.</font>

8
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:09,570
<font color="#787878">Thanks, man. Just remember that when you see my sales report for last month.</font>

9
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:10,570
<font color="#787878">Oh, I saw it last night.</font>

10
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:13,570
<font color="#787878">Shit. Has Dennis seen it?</font>

11
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,422
<font color="#787878">Not yet.</font>

12
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,886
<font color="#787878">Look, you just need to make a decision, you know?</font>

13
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:20,302
<font color="#787878">Are you gonna be "chef" or are you gonna be "sales guy"?</font>

14
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:24,640
<font color="#787878">I'm saying that as your friend because, as your boss, I'm ready to fire your ass.</font>

15
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,685
<font color="#787878">~ As your friend, I appreciate that advice.
~ Good.</font>

16
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:32,523
<font color="#787878">Inside my baby's room</font>

17
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,407
<font color="#787878">Hold on, man, I'll be right back.</font>

18
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,327
<font color="#787878">Yeah, I guess I'm doing okay</font>

19
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:38,533
<font color="#787878">I moved in with....</font>

20
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:43,667
<font color="#787878">Molly. Your ticket's canceled.</font>

21
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,332
<font color="#787878">Tell me that's a mistake.</font>

22
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,129
<font color="#787878">I was gonna tell you after this weekend.</font>

23
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:49,919
<font color="#787878">Uh, tell me what?</font>

24
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:53,255
<font color="#787878">That I don't think it's such a good idea.</font>

25
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:57,423
<font color="#787878">What, the trip? it's my brother's wedding.</font>

26
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,266
<font color="#787878">What's going on here?</font>

27
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,268
<font color="#787878">We should talk about this later.
Let's just....</font>

28
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:06,273
<font color="#787878">What, pretend like I didn't see this for the next two days? No, let's talk about this.</font>

29
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,274
<font color="#787878">It's not working out, Sam.</font>

30
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,320
<font color="#787878">We're not working out.</font>

31
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:17,484
<font color="#787878">Hey.</font>

32
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:20,370
<font color="#787878">Hey. Oh, it's, uh, Candice, right?</font>

33
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,743
<font color="#787878">~ Not funny.
~ Oh....</font>

34
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:27,127
<font color="#787878">Okay, sorry, this is not a vacation. Okay, this is a business retreat.</font>

35
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,913
<font color="#787878">So we're gonna be all business
for the next two days.</font>

36
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,252
<font color="#787878">Sorry.</font>

37
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:34,258
<font color="#787878">I love you, but doesn't change the fact that you're still an intern.</font>

38
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:41,808
<font color="#787878">Oh, um, but that 12:30 curfew tonight? You should plan on breaking that.</font>

39
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:43,014
<font color="#787878">Why?</font>

40
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:46,271
<font color="#787878">For the naked team-building.</font>

41
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,622
<font color="#787878">Hey, Olivia.</font>

42
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,078
<font color="#787878">Don't forget these.</font>

43
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:09,586
<font color="#787878">Oh, yeah. I keep trying to.</font>

44
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:12,543
<font color="#787878">~ Hmm.
~ I like it. it's very Lisa Loeb.</font>

45
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,049
<font color="#787878">Oh, well, you know....</font>

46
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:18,383
<font color="#787878">I'd rather be very Olivia.</font>

47
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,138
<font color="#787878">We got a gig on Sunday.</font>

48
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:21,640
<font color="#787878">Yeah, I'll be there.</font>

49
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,509
<font color="#787878">Morning, Peter.</font>

50
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,183
<font color="#787878">~ Looking good.
~ Uh, hi.</font>

51
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:30,519
<font color="#787878">Olivia. Have you slept
with every hipster in town yet?</font>

52
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:33,401
<font color="#787878">Candice. Do you actually get paid
for this internship....</font>

53
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,813
<font color="#787878">or does Daddy
just increase your allowance?</font>

54
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:39,904
<font color="#787878">You know, if you wanna get rid of that baby fat, you should try the gym.</font>

55
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,615
<font color="#787878">They have these workout machines
that you use on your back.</font>

56
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:43,869
<font color="#787878">You're good at that.</font>

57
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:45,952
<font color="#787878">Sweetie, it's not fat.</font>

58
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:50,168
<font color="#787878">They're called tits.</font>

59
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,499
<font color="#787878">You're not looking so hot there,
Moll-face.</font>

60
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:56,917
<font color="#787878">Gee, thanks.</font>

61
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,969
<font color="#787878">Did you try the little jam-bread whatever your boyfriend made?</font>

62
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:03,598
<font color="#787878">I gotta tell you, he's a pre.... Uh-oh, that's what it is, is it? Did I touch a nerve?</font>

63
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:06,510
<font color="#787878">~ Just leave me alone, Isaac.
~ Hey, Moll? Moll? Look at me.</font>

64
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,178
<font color="#787878">If you ever need anyone to talk to....</font>

65
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,353
<font color="#787878">I've been told I'm a good listener by a lot of ladies. Shh, wait.</font>

66
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:15,519
<font color="#787878">Tell me this is Kimber from last Tuesday. Wait, I'm sorry, which Kimber is....?</font>

67
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,437
<font color="#787878">Hey, let's sit next to each other
on the bus.</font>

68
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:20,483
<font color="#787878">No, no, I remember you.
You were, like, a bigger gal, right?</font>

69
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,068
<font color="#787878">You know what you should do?
You should apologize.</font>

70
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:25,032
<font color="#787878">~ Why?
~ Doesn't matter.</font>

71
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:26,788
<font color="#787878">Never matters. "I'm sorry, because I...."</font>

72
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,373
<font color="#787878">Oh, shit.</font>

73
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,213
<font color="#787878">Hey, Stan, how's it going?</font>

74
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:41,424
<font color="#787878">Uh, it's Sam, sir.</font>

75
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,880
<font color="#787878">Did you just correct me?</font>

76
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:46,596
<font color="#787878">No.</font>

77
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:47,884
<font color="#787878">Look at me.</font>

78
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:49,348
<font color="#787878">~ What's my name?
~ Dennis.</font>

79
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:50,888
<font color="#787878">Look away.</font>

80
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:52,271
<font color="#787878">All set, Pete?</font>

81
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,933
<font color="#787878">Yes, sir.
Yeah, we're just waiting on Nathan.</font>

82
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,774
<font color="#787878">What's the one thing
we can't recycle, Pete?</font>

83
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:59,028
<font color="#787878">Wasted time, sir.</font>

84
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:02,403
<font color="#787878">Exactly. I wanna be on the road
in 90 seconds.</font>

85
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:05,193
<font color="#787878">Uh, well, I just saw his car,
so I'll go track him down.</font>

86
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,613
<font color="#787878">Way to show some initiative, Stan.</font>

87
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:09,531
<font color="#787878">It's gonna be a good day.</font>

88
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,039
<font color="#787878">~ Hey, guys.
~ Hey, man.</font>

89
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:15,416
<font color="#787878">What's up, bud?</font>

90
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,255
<font color="#787878">Why you riding Nate so hard, man?</font>

91
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:27,766
<font color="#787878">You know,
I'm just trying to make sense of it here.</font>

92
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,473
<font color="#787878">Three weeks ago they brought you in as assistant plant manager....</font>

93
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:35,186
<font color="#787878">and now you got a day off?
~ It's not a day off. It's a re.... Re....</font>

94
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,941
<font color="#787878">Re.... Re-what? Retarded?</font>

95
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,069
<font color="#787878">It's a retreat.</font>

96
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,398
<font color="#787878">I don't wanna go. I'm just following orders.</font>

97
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:45,568
<font color="#787878">~ So if you don't like it, then you can....
~ I can what? What? I can what?</font>

98
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,119
<font color="#787878">Nathan, hey. Come on, man,
we're all waiting for you.</font>

99
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,914
<font color="#787878">~ Yeah, okay.
~ Now, hold on. What you gonna say?</font>

100
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,666
<font color="#787878">What you gonna say?</font>

101
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:58,205
<font color="#787878">I got 15 years on you here. You got, what, four years in some classroom upstate?</font>

102
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,044
<font color="#787878">Listen, if you think I'm gonna sit here....</font>

103
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:03,050
<font color="#787878">Not a good idea, Roy.
Not a good idea, man.</font>

104
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,381
<font color="#787878">We're fine for the day.</font>

105
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,592
<font color="#787878">Why do you let him get away with that?</font>

106
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,306
<font color="#787878">No choice. He's the union rep.</font>

107
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:15,564
<font color="#787878">I fire him and suddenly
I've got a factory full of Roys.</font>

108
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,975
<font color="#787878">But I'll win him over, even if it kills me.</font>

109
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,022
<font color="#787878">What about you?</font>

110
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:22,813
<font color="#787878">When are they gonna offer you
that permanent gig at the restaurant?</font>

111
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,198
<font color="#787878">~ They already did.
~ Dude, that's great.</font>

112
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:26,448
<font color="#787878">I don't know, man.</font>

113
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:30,329
<font color="#787878">I mean, they wanna send me
to the flagship restaurant in Paris....</font>

114
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:33,036
<font color="#787878">for who knows how long?
Could be six months, could be a year.</font>

115
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:35,451
<font color="#787878">I just thought
I'd be leaving too much behind.</font>

116
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,544
<font color="#787878">Although now I'm not so sure.</font>

117
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:45,176
<font color="#787878">Well, look, if you do go to Paris, do me a favor.</font>

118
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:47,758
<font color="#787878">~ What's that?
~ Take Roy with you.</font>

119
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,013
<font color="#787878">Aw, hell, no.</font>

120
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,563
<font color="#787878">Hey, Sam.</font>

121
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,065
<font color="#787878">You coming?</font>

122
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,820
<font color="#787878">Yeah.</font>

adventure at 180 Corporate Consulting.</font>

00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:56,736
<font color="#787878">Was he upset? Scale of 1 to 10.</font>

257
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:58,863
<font color="#787878">It's personal.</font>

258
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:03,740
<font color="#787878">You must have been pissed, right?
Getting dumped like that.</font>

259
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:05,908
<font color="#787878">What does that have to do
with anything?</font>

260
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:08,961
<font color="#787878">I'm just trying to get all the pieces of the puzzle together....</font>

261
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:12,293
<font color="#787878">before I start moving them around, making them fit.</font>

262
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:17,879
<font color="#787878">Look, I just had a hunch that something bad was gonna happen. That's it.</font>

263
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:19,388
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

264
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,932
<font color="#787878">Excuse me.</font>

265
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:27,096
<font color="#787878">Forensics came back with the analysis.</font>

266
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:29,982
<font color="#787878">~ And?
~ They're chalking it up to high winds....</font>

267
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,108
<font color="#787878">and structural damage
from the construction.</font>

268
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:33,611
<font color="#787878">"High winds"?</font>

269
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,737
<font color="#787878">Yeah. Send everyone home.</font>

270
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:38,440
<font color="#787878">You're free to go.</font>

271
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:48,289
<font color="#787878">I have a feeling
we'll be seeing each other again.</font>

272
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:49,793
<font color="#787878">Call it a hunch.</font>

273
00:22:57,251 --> 00:23:00,346
<font color="#787878">Authorities are calling
the North Bay Bridge collapse....</font>

274
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:02,302
<font color="#787878">a freak act of nature....</font>

275
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:07,140
<font color="#787878">citing a highway improvement project that may have weakened the superstructure.</font>

276
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:11,274
<font color="#787878">Among the survivors were eight employees of Presage Paper....</font>

<font color="#787878">on their way to a business retreat.</font>

<font color="#787878">The other 17 employees
were killed in the collapse.</font>

<font color="#787878">And although they've been branded
the "lucky eight"....</font>

280
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:24,279
<font color="#787878">the surviving employees
now face an uncertain future.</font>

281
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:45,348
<font color="#787878">Hey, guys.</font>

282
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:46,633
<font color="#787878">Hey.</font>

283
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,847
<font color="#787878">Hey.</font>

284
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:52,690
<font color="#787878">Anybody know
when this thing's supposed to start?</font>

285
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:56,193
<font color="#787878">When Dennis gets here, I guess.</font>

286
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:59,651
<font color="#787878">That agent still hounding you?</font>

287
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:04,319
<font color="#787878">No. You heard the news,
it was natural causes.</font>

288
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:06,654
<font color="#787878">Yeah, more like supernatural.</font>

289
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:10,916
<font color="#787878">How you holding up? I tried calling.</font>

290
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:14,420
<font color="#787878">No, yeah, I saw. I was just tired....</font>

291
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:17,707
<font color="#787878">So?</font>

292
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:21,051
<font color="#787878">How did you explain it?</font>

293
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,222
<font color="#787878">I didn't.</font>

294
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:27,429
<font color="#787878">I couldn't.</font>

295
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:29,389
<font color="#787878">Sam, there had to be a reason.</font>

296
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:31,929
<font color="#787878">Heh. That is exactly
what the agent kept saying.</font>

297
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:39,562
<font color="#787878">Whatever answer you're looking for, I don't have it.</font>

298
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:42,072
<font color="#787878">Yeah, Sam's right.
It doesn't matter how it happened.</font>

299
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:45,610
<font color="#787878">We should all just put it behind us and be grateful we're still alive.</font>

300
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:50,907
<font color="#787878">Definitely beats the alternative, right?</font>

301
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:52,958
<font color="#787878">I look out at the faces today....</font>

302
00:24:53,117 --> 00:24:56,747
<font color="#787878">and I see family members, friends.</font>

303
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:02,130
<font color="#787878">But the people that left us on the bridge that day, they were more than that.</font>

304
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:04,799
<font color="#787878">People like Jennifer Alcott....</font>

305
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:08,428
<font color="#787878">Chris Boylan....</font>

306
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:11,260
<font color="#787878">David Buckler.</font>

307
00:25:12,553 --> 00:25:14,555
<font color="#787878">Maybe you worked next to them.</font>

308
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:16,440
<font color="#787878">Maybe you worked for them.</font>

309
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:20,398
<font color="#787878">But we all worked with them, huh?</font>

310
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:23,651
<font color="#787878">Who can forget Trevor Wino's smile?</font>

311
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:27,822
<font color="#787878">Or Isaac Palmer.</font>

312
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,029
<font color="#787878">Did he just say my name?</font>

313
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:33,623
<font color="#787878">~ That's not funny.
~ I know, I'm sorry.</font>

314
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:36,706
<font color="#787878">I just get weird with tragedies. I'm sorry.</font>

315
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:39,963
<font color="#787878">I see dead people.</font>

316
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:42,962
<font color="#787878">Guys.</font>

317
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:53,640
<font color="#787878">Death....</font>

318
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:57,648
<font color="#787878">doesn't like to be cheated.</font>

319
00:25:58,307 --> 00:25:59,559
<font color="#787878">Excuse me?</font>

320
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,151
<font color="#787878">What's that supposed to mean?</font>

321
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:08,988
<font color="#787878">You all just be careful now.</font>

322
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:11,324
<font color="#787878">Okay. Thanks for the advice!</font>

323
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:13,488
<font color="#787878">Creepy guy.</font>

324
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:39,474
<font color="#787878">How's that foie gras, Sam? Waiting on you.</font>

325
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:53,863
<font color="#787878">Wasted like a drunk
She drank, drunk, drunk</font>

326
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,747
<font color="#787878">Stop it</font>

327
00:26:55,906 --> 00:26:57,374
<font color="#787878">It's not forgotten</font>

328
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,247
<font color="#787878">Thanks.</font>

329
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:00,626
<font color="#787878">Got my dessert?</font>

330
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,049
<font color="#787878">Whats the matter with it?</font>

331
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:12,431
<font color="#787878">Said it was flat. No flavor.</font>

332
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:15,597
<font color="#787878">~ Do they want something else?
~ Yeah.</font>

333
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:16,931
<font color="#787878">The check.</font>

334
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:21,815
<font color="#787878">Let me taste it.</font>

335
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:30,699
<font color="#787878">The customer is an asshole.
The bourguignon is good.</font>

336
00:27:42,953 --> 00:27:44,580
<font color="#787878">Hold on.</font>

337
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:58,810
<font color="#787878">You mind if I come in?</font>

338
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:00,892
<font color="#787878">Yeah. Sure.</font>

339
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:12,111
<font color="#787878">Thanks.</font>

340
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:14,072
<font color="#787878">I thought you'd be working tonight.</font>

341
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:17,454
<font color="#787878">Yeah. You know,
I worked the first shift, but....</font>

342
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:20,745
<font color="#787878">there was something else I needed to do.</font>

343
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,082
<font color="#787878">~ Can I....?
~ Oh.</font>

344
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:30,876
<font color="#787878">Yeah. Sure, go ahead.</font>

345
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,806
<font color="#787878">Thank you.</font>

346
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:28,563
<font color="#787878">Listen....</font>

347
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:32,772
<font color="#787878">When everything started going down on that bridge....</font>

348
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:38,698
<font color="#787878">the only thing I thought about
was you.</font>

349
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:41,871
<font color="#787878">Getting you to safety.</font>

350
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:46,039
<font color="#787878">You are the only thing
I care about, Molly.</font>

351
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,419
<font color="#787878">Whatever's wrong, I can fix it.</font>

352
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:54,004
<font color="#787878">You haven't done anything wrong.</font>

353
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:57,053
<font color="#787878">Then, what? What is it?</font>

354
00:29:58,547 --> 00:29:59,594
<font color="#787878">Paris.</font>

355
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:01,383
<font color="#787878">We talked about that.</font>

356
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:06,397
<font color="#787878">I'm not going to uproot my life,
leave you, for that job.</font>

357
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:09,058
<font color="#787878">But it's the only thing
you've ever dreamed of.</font>

358
00:30:11,852 --> 00:30:13,775
<font color="#787878">Life is too short, Sam.</font>

359
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:16,531
<font color="#787878">You have to go after what you love.</font>

360
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:18,741
<font color="#787878">I am.</font>

361
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:25,240
<font color="#787878">You should take the job.</font>

362
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,453
<font color="#787878">Go to Paris.</font>

363
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:47,474
<font color="#787878">~ Hey.
~ Hey.</font>

364
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:49,059
<font color="#787878">What's the matter?</font>

365
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:52,772
<font color="#787878">I don't know. I'm not ready.
I don't feel ready.</font>

366
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:56,404
<font color="#787878">It's been really hard to concentrate after everything.</font>

367
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:58,736
<font color="#787878">Yeah? Are you sure?</font>

368
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:00,738
<font color="#787878">Yeah.</font>

369
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:03,780
<font color="#787878">Because this is the last practice
before the championship.</font>

370
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:06,452
<font color="#787878">And it's your last practice
of your college career.</font>

371
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:08,367
<font color="#787878">I know, but....</font>

372
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:12,204
<font color="#787878">I think you got this.</font>

373
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:15,249
<font color="#787878">~ Really?
~ Yeah.</font>

374
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,218
<font color="#787878">I mean, you love it out there.</font>

375
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:21,297
<font color="#787878">Okay. You're right.</font>

376
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:23,682
<font color="#787878">And besides, coach would kill me. Heh.</font>

377
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,433
<font color="#787878">Yeah.</font>

378
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:26,684
<font color="#787878">Here.</font>

379
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:30,309
<font color="#787878">Thanks.</font>

380
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:31,644
<font color="#787878">Come here.</font>

381
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:35,401
<font color="#787878">Bye.</font>

382
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,943
<font color="#787878">You got this.</font>

383
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:51,536
<font color="#787878">~ You have to get a little more speed.
~ You gotta hit that follow-up.</font>

384
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:59,259
<font color="#787878">~ I'm sore from the back extensions.
~ Really?</font>

385
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:06,679
<font color="#787878">Okay, seriously, this is stupid.</font>

386
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:09,345
<font color="#787878">They've gotta make it cooler
or we're gonna pass out.</font>

387
00:32:09,511 --> 00:32:11,058
<font color="#787878">They're working on it.</font>

388
00:32:11,221 --> 00:32:13,315
<font color="#787878">Well, they should have it fixed by now.</font>

389
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,333
<font color="#787878">Come on, Candice. You're up.</font>

390
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:51,015
<font color="#787878">Come on, Candice. You got this.</font>

391
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:20,333
<font color="#787878">Candice, now.</font>

392
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,887
<font color="#787878">Really strong value on this.</font>

393
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:43,067
<font color="#787878">Hey, coach! How was that?</font>

394
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:05,836
<font color="#787878">I wanna see you guys
run the routine all the way through once.</font>

395
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:25,234
<font color="#787878">~ That's good.
~ Whew.</font>

396
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:27,445
<font color="#787878">All right, Janine next. Let's go.</font>

397
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:29,905
<font color="#787878">Let's go, ladies, and drink water.</font>

398
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:35,870
<font color="#787878">That's it.</font>

399
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:38,326
<font color="#787878">Every time, Candice.</font>

400
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:45,125
<font color="#787878">~ There you go.
~ Thanks.</font>

401
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:47,215
<font color="#787878">Nicely done, Candice.</font>

402
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,595
<font color="#787878">Okay, go to bars.</font>

403
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,886
<font color="#787878">Come on. Hit the floor. You can do it.</font>

404
00:34:58,388 --> 00:35:00,311
<font color="#787878">Go hard this time, Candice.</font>

405
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:02,692
<font color="#787878">Let's be aggressive.</font>

406
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:07,530
<font color="#787878">Here we go, Candice. Stay loose.</font>

407
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,158
<font color="#787878">Okay, Porter, it's your turn.</font>

408
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:13,028
<font color="#787878">Stay focused.</font>

409
00:35:14,404 --> 00:35:15,701
<font color="#787878">Good.</font>

410
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:23,543
<font color="#787878">Looking good, Candice.</font>

411
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:07,416
<font color="#787878">Candice? Candice'?!</font>

412
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,880
<font color="#787878">~ Oh, what happened?
~ Don't touch her.</font>

413
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:11,761
<font color="#787878">Someone call 911.</font>

414
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,921
<font color="#787878">Candice?</font>

415
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:36,111
<font color="#787878">Peter.</font>

416
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:52,218
<font color="#787878">I came as soon as I heard.</font>

417
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,507
<font color="#787878">She was doing great.</font>

418
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:03,560
<font color="#787878">She was almost finished with her routine and then....</font>

419
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:12,564
<font color="#787878">Why did it happen?</font>

420
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:17,785
<font color="#787878">This doesn't make any sense.</font>

421
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:19,662
<font color="#787878">I don't know, man.</font>

422
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:25,452
<font color="#787878">I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Peter.</font>

423
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:41,016
<font color="#787878">Let's just go, Sam.</font>

424
00:37:55,315 --> 00:37:56,783
<font color="#787878">Hey.</font>

425
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:59,031
<font color="#787878">How's it going?</font>

426
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:01,905
<font color="#787878">It's weird.</font>

427
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:04,536
<font color="#787878">Being here, I mean.</font>

428
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,499
<font color="#787878">It's just so quiet.</font>

429
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:12,841
<font color="#787878">Yeah, well, Dennis had all the calls rerouted to corporate.</font>

430
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:16,879
<font color="#787878">Yeah, well, it's depressing.</font>

431
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:23,351
<font color="#787878">Holy crap. Did you guys
get your bereavement pay yet?</font>

432
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:29,140
<font color="#787878">Hey, what's he doing here?</font>

433
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:32,397
<font color="#787878">I think he just needed the distraction.</font>

434
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,028
<font color="#787878">Yeah.</font>

435
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,902
<font color="#787878">Yeah, that's a bummer about Candice.</font>

436
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:40,155
<font color="#787878">Guess we all should have seen
that coming.</font>

437
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:43,826
<font color="#787878">What?</font>

438
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:47,868
<font color="#787878">You see the crazy shit those gymnasts do. I'm surprised it doesn't happen more often.</font>

439
00:38:49,244 --> 00:38:51,542
<font color="#787878">Once you've handled the e-mail....</font>

440
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:54,583
<font color="#787878">you'll need to deactivate all the key cards of the deceased employees.</font>

441
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,251
<font color="#787878">Instructions are in your binder.</font>

442
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:59,717
<font color="#787878">Well, shouldn't that be the job
of the facility manager?</font>

443
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:02,515
<font color="#787878">The facility manager's dead.</font>

444
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:06,427
<font color="#787878">Dennis, you want me to fly someone up there?</font>

445
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:07,933
<font color="#787878">No, no, I got it.</font>

446
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:16,771
<font color="#787878">Aw, Debbie.</font>

447
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:24,908
<font color="#787878">You were so naughty.</font>

448
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:40,090
<font color="#787878">Fuck it.</font>

449
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,183
<font color="#787878">Robert, my man.</font>

450
00:39:58,605 --> 00:39:59,902
<font color="#787878">Ow.</font>

451
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:03,826
<font color="#787878">Shit.</font>

452
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:12,710
<font color="#787878">You shouldn't have, buddy.</font>

453
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,590
<font color="#787878">Hey, man, what are you doing up here?</font>

454
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:29,352
<font color="#787878">Had to get off the factory floor, man. Roy's driving me crazy.</font>

455
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:32,688
<font color="#787878">So, uh, who wants one?</font>

456
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:33,973
<font color="#787878">Where'd you get these?</font>

457
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:38,270
<font color="#787878">I stole it out of Roy's truck.
Ha, ha. it's good, right? Ha, ha.</font>

458
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:39,938
<font color="#787878">I got something better.</font>

459
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:41,985
<font color="#787878">Ooh, nice one.</font>

460
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:43,695
<font color="#787878">Yeah, count me in.</font>

461
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:46,028
<font color="#787878">Are you sure you wanna share that?</font>

462
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:51,249
<font color="#787878">If I don't, I'll end up drinking it alone, which is just sad.</font>

463
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,994
<font color="#787878">Well, this day just got way more fun.</font>

464
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:09,467
<font color="#787878">No, I did call you.</font>

465
00:41:09,676 --> 00:41:13,271
<font color="#787878">Of course. I just called you
right now, didn't I?</font>

466
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:16,228
<font color="#787878">Because I really do
wanna take you out again.</font>

467
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:19,395
<font color="#787878">Yeah, yeah, we'll do, like, a nice romantic dinner.</font>

468
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,063
<font color="#787878">You know,
somewhere maybe outside the city.</font>

469
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,482
<font color="#787878">Hold up.</font>

470
00:41:26,776 --> 00:41:29,029
<font color="#787878">You know what? I gotta go.</font>

471
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:31,368
<font color="#787878">No, no, no. I'm not blowing you off.</font>

472
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:35,206
<font color="#787878">Hey, listen. Hey, who's my girl, Kimber?</font>

473
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:37,120
<font color="#787878">Amber, yes, that's what I said.</font>

474
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:38,333
<font color="#787878">Excuse me.</font>

475
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:49,424
<font color="#787878">Amber? Amber, I'm sorry, wait a second. Is that weird sound on your end or mi....?</font>

476
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:54,266
<font color="#787878">Sorry about that. My, uh, sister
tends to get a little chatty sometimes.</font>

477
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:56,272
<font color="#787878">~ Uh-huh.
~ Uh-huh.</font>

478
00:41:56,431 --> 00:42:00,436
<font color="#787878">So tell me about stress relief.</font>

479
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:04,231
<font color="#787878">And what does this really get me?</font>

480
00:42:04,397 --> 00:42:07,116
<font color="#787878">This covers a session
for two different physical therapies.</font>

481
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:09,573
<font color="#787878">Like massage therapy?</font>

482
00:42:10,403 --> 00:42:12,656
<font color="#787878">Erotic massage?</font>

483
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:17,745
<font color="#787878">This is a family operation.
Everyone on staff is professional.</font>

484
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:21,881
<font color="#787878">Hey, that's great. I prefer a professional. In fact, you know what? I kind of demand it.</font>

485
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:27,763
<font color="#787878">I'm just trying to clarify, though, that this professional experience ends, uh....</font>

486
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:30,798
<font color="#787878">....happy.</font>

487
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:35,887
<font color="#787878">I know exactly what you need.</font>

488
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:38,102
<font color="#787878">Oh, I'm sure you do.</font>

489
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:40,437
<font color="#787878">~ Follow me, please.
~ I'd love to.</font>

490
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,977
<font color="#787878">Whoa, whoa, whoa.</font>

491
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:43,736
<font color="#787878">Slow down there a little bit.</font>

492
00:42:43,895 --> 00:42:46,774
<font color="#787878">Yeah. Yeah, you have
a lovely little Canter.</font>

493
00:42:50,777 --> 00:42:52,950
<font color="#787878">Yum yum, dim sum.</font>

494
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:54,489
<font color="#787878">Hold up there a second.</font>

495
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:57,124
<font color="#787878">All right, these are solid.
Just making sure.</font>

496
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:59,456
<font color="#787878">Tend to be a bit noisy,
if you know what I mean.</font>

497
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:07,756
<font color="#787878">Ha, ha. Yo, Buddha.
Slow down on the rice cakes.</font>

498
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:13,971
<font color="#787878">~ Just close your eyes.
~ Mm-hm.</font>

499
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:15,385
<font color="#787878">~ Relax.
~ Ooh.</font>

500
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:20,227
<font color="#787878">And Someone will be in
to service you soon.</font>

501
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:22,312
<font color="#787878">Oh, yeah.</font>

502
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:36,656
<font color="#787878">Oh, yeah.</font>

503
00:43:36,823 --> 00:43:38,166
<font color="#787878">Feels dynamite.</font>

504
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:42,249
<font color="#787878">No, no. You're going the wrong way there, little lady.</font>

505
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:46,466
<font color="#787878">Oh.</font>

506
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:49,628
<font color="#787878">Wait a second, what happened
to the younger version of you?</font>

507
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:56,183
<font color="#787878">Okay, I'm sorry.
Do you come with subtitles?</font>

508
00:43:57,552 --> 00:43:59,395
<font color="#787878">Maybe I should go.</font>

509
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:02,477
<font color="#787878">Don't know what that means. No idea. Yep.</font>

510
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,108
<font color="#787878">Ow!</font>

511
00:44:04,267 --> 00:44:05,314
<font color="#787878">Fuck!</font>

512
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:10,110
<font color="#787878">No, no, that's okay.
That's okay, I'm all right.</font>

513
00:44:10,273 --> 00:44:11,445
<font color="#787878">Holy shit, you're strong.</font>

514
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,243
<font color="#787878">What are you doing? Ow.</font>

515
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:15,824
<font color="#787878">You're a little aggressive.</font>

516
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:19,407
<font color="#787878">What's "capay"?
I don't know what that means.</font>

517
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:22,164
<font color="#787878">I don't want a "foo-hay." No "foo-hay." Aah!</font>

518
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:29,463
<font color="#787878">Cheers.</font>

519
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:31,928
<font color="#787878">Mm.</font>

520
00:44:37,967 --> 00:44:39,139
<font color="#787878">Shit, that's my ride.</font>

521
00:44:39,302 --> 00:44:40,895
<font color="#787878">Shit. I gotta go.</font>

522
00:44:41,304 --> 00:44:42,806
<font color="#787878">Leaving more for us.</font>

523
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:53,233
<font color="#787878">All right, well, more for me.</font>

524
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:54,525
<font color="#787878">All right, bye.</font>

525
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:56,034
<font color="#787878">~ See you later.
~ Okay.</font>

526
00:44:56,194 --> 00:44:57,241
<font color="#787878">Later.</font>

527
00:44:57,403 --> 00:45:00,873
<font color="#787878">This is the end,
so, what are we toasting to?</font>

528
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:02,830
<font color="#787878">To, uh, finding new jobs.</font>

529
00:45:02,992 --> 00:45:05,370
<font color="#787878">Because it's only a matter of time before they shut us down.</font>

530
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:08,210
<font color="#787878">~ Hear, hear.
~ Oh. To starting over.</font>

531
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,011
<font color="#787878">Peter?</font>

532
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:19,551
<font color="#787878">It just doesn't make sense.</font>

533
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:22,561
<font color="#787878">She dies doing something
that she's done....</font>

534
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,644
<font color="#787878">almost every day
for the last 15 years of her life.</font>

535
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:29,314
<font color="#787878">She said she didn't wanna do it.</font>

536
00:45:29,477 --> 00:45:31,730
<font color="#787878">She said she wasn't ready.</font>

537
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:36,318
<font color="#787878">And I should have stopped her.</font>

538
00:45:37,193 --> 00:45:38,945
<font color="#787878">I should have done something.
I should've....</font>

539
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:41,455
<font color="#787878">Peter, there wasn't anything
you could've done.</font>

540
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:45,622
<font color="#787878">How do you know?</font>

541
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:52,754
<font color="#787878">I'm sorry. I'm sorry.</font>

542
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:05,939
<font color="#787878">Hello, Agent Block? This is Dennis.</font>

543
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:09,943
<font color="#787878">Yeah, Peter just freaked out
about something, I don't know what.</font>

544
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:11,603
<font color="#787878">Does that mean anything?</font>

545
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:14,192
<font color="#787878">You told me to call if I saw anything odd.</font>

546
00:46:14,355 --> 00:46:19,862
<font color="#787878">I don't know yet, but thank you, Dennis, and call me if you see anything strange.</font>

547
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:21,449
<font color="#787878">Stranger.</font>

548
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:25,913
<font color="#787878">Should we maybe have code names
for one another, do you think?</font>

549
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:29,537
<font color="#787878">Over and out.</font>

550
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:33,708
<font color="#787878">All right, ahem,
show me how this happened.</font>

551
00:46:34,959 --> 00:46:36,085
<font color="#787878">I don't think I can.</font>

552
00:46:36,252 --> 00:46:37,845
<font color="#787878">What do you mean?</font>

553
00:46:38,004 --> 00:46:43,602
<font color="#787878">I mean, I could try it a hundred times and never re-create exactly what happened here.</font>

554
00:46:45,011 --> 00:46:46,558
<font color="#787878">This is some freaky shit.</font>

555
00:46:57,523 --> 00:46:58,570
<font color="#787878">God!</font>

556
00:47:03,404 --> 00:47:05,202
<font color="#787878">Oh, that actually felt great.</font>

557
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:10,582
<font color="#787878">Oh, yeah. Awesome.</font>

558
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:13,540
<font color="#787878">Oh....</font>

559
00:47:15,124 --> 00:47:17,627
<font color="#787878">Wait. Are those things even sterilized?</font>

560
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:21,093
<font color="#787878">No, no. I'm not catching any diseases unless I've earned them.</font>

561
00:47:29,055 --> 00:47:31,558
<font color="#787878">Wait a second. You understood that.</font>

562
00:47:32,725 --> 00:47:34,693
<font color="#787878">You speak English.</font>

563
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:38,985
<font color="#787878">Oh.</font>

564
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:47,039
<font color="#787878">All right, you know what?</font>

565
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:50,077
<font color="#787878">Let's do this.
Two billion people can't be Wong.</font>

566
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:53,079
<font color="#787878">I said Wong. You follow me?</font>

567
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:54,588
<font color="#787878">You get it, you're Chinese.</font>

568
00:47:58,626 --> 00:48:01,379
<font color="#787878">Ow, ow. Okay, it's in. it's definitely in. Ow, okay, yes, it is in.</font>

569
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,803
<font color="#787878">How many of these are you gonna
put in me?</font>

570
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:21,407
<font color="#787878">Oh, uh, hey,
can you grab that for me? Thanks.</font>

571
00:48:23,484 --> 00:48:24,906
<font color="#787878">Hey.</font>

572
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:29,323
<font color="#787878">That's not very nice, you know.</font>

573
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:44,630
<font color="#787878">Okay, your thumbs are kind of
in my eyes.</font>

574
00:48:44,797 --> 00:48:46,470
<font color="#787878">I'm not gonna lie, it's a little annoying.</font>

575
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:50,428
<font color="#787878">Once again, Chinese lady,
I don't have a clue what you're saying.</font>

576
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:54,565
<font color="#787878">Thirty minutes. You sleep.</font>

577
00:49:05,443 --> 00:49:07,286
<font color="#787878">Sleep.</font>

578
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:35,397
<font color="#787878">Oh.</font>

579
00:49:36,265 --> 00:49:39,439
<font color="#787878">Hey! Fire!</font>

580
00:49:39,602 --> 00:49:41,479
<font color="#787878">Hello?!</font>

581
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:42,692
<font color="#787878">Hey!</font>

582
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:45,570
<font color="#787878">Hey! Hey!</font>

583
00:49:45,733 --> 00:49:48,111
<font color="#787878">Hey, there's a fire in here!</font>

584
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:50,196
<font color="#787878">Hey, there's a fire!</font>

585
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:52,282
<font color="#787878">Get in here!</font>

586
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:56,637
<font color="#787878">Oh, shit.</font>

587
00:51:16,991 --> 00:51:18,959
<font color="#787878">You should come with me.</font>

588
00:51:19,368 --> 00:51:20,620
<font color="#787878">To Paris?</font>

589
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:24,416
<font color="#787878">Yeah, you know, you said it yourself. Like, you're gonna have to start over.</font>

590
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,297
<font color="#787878">Start over with me.</font>

591
00:51:29,712 --> 00:51:31,555
<font color="#787878">How many drinks have you had?</font>

592
00:51:31,714 --> 00:51:34,684
<font color="#787878">Enough. Molly, I'm serious.</font>

593
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:39,018
<font color="#787878">Look, you were right.
If I don't take the job, I'll regret it.</font>

594
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:42,232
<font color="#787878">But I'm not willing to lose you.</font>

595
00:51:42,391 --> 00:51:44,940
<font color="#787878">Why does it have to be
one or the other?</font>

596
00:51:45,686 --> 00:51:47,313
<font color="#787878">I'm better when you're with me.</font>

597
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:52,159
<font color="#787878">Uh, guys, you're not gonna believe this.</font>

598
00:52:05,623 --> 00:52:07,216
<font color="#787878">They're saying it was a freak accident.</font>

599
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:09,468
<font color="#787878">Yeah, raise your hand
if you believe that.</font>

600
00:52:09,627 --> 00:52:12,801
<font color="#787878">Who dies during a massage? Seriously.</font>

601
00:52:13,047 --> 00:52:15,095
<font color="#787878">First Candice, now Isaac.</font>

602
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:17,100
<font color="#787878">It can't be a coincidence.</font>

603
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:19,019
<font color="#787878">It's not.</font>

604
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:20,933
<font color="#787878">Where are you going?</font>

605
00:52:21,764 --> 00:52:23,766
<font color="#787878">It's that creepy dude.</font>

606
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:26,731
<font color="#787878">Why are you following us?</font>

607
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:29,063
<font color="#787878">Who are you?</font>

608
00:52:30,189 --> 00:52:33,910
<font color="#787878">You were at the cemetery,
then the gym, now here.</font>

609
00:52:34,902 --> 00:52:36,324
<font color="#787878">What are you doing?</font>

610
00:52:36,487 --> 00:52:38,239
<font color="#787878">My job.</font>

611
00:52:47,456 --> 00:52:49,333
<font color="#787878">What's happening to us?</font>

612
00:52:53,212 --> 00:52:55,510
<font color="#787878">What makes you think I know anything?</font>

613
00:52:55,673 --> 00:52:56,845
<font color="#787878">You warned us.</font>

614
00:52:57,466 --> 00:53:00,390
<font color="#787878">At the memorial service.
You said Death didn't like to be cheated.</font>

615
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:03,601
<font color="#787878">It's just that I've seen this before.</font>

616
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:05,561
<font color="#787878">Well, that doesn't do me any good. Heh, heh.</font>

617
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:08,102
<font color="#787878">A lucky few survive a disaster.</font>

618
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:13,320
<font color="#787878">And then one by one,
Death comes for them all.</font>

619
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:17,286
<font color="#787878">You changed things on that bridge.</font>

620
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:22,541
<font color="#787878">There's a wrinkle in reality.
And that wrinkle is you.</font>

621
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:25,123
<font color="#787878">So, what, we're doomed to die?</font>

622
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:27,121
<font color="#787878">I mean, is that it?</font>

623
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:30,879
<font color="#787878">We just got our lives back,
so, what kind of fucked up karma is that?</font>

624
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,759
<font color="#787878">~ Where is she?!
~ I'm not gonna let you hurt her, Peter.</font>

625
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:35,671
<font color="#787878">You were supposed to die on that bridge.</font>

626
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:38,261
<font color="#787878">You're not supposed to be here.</font>

627
00:53:39,091 --> 00:53:40,809
<font color="#787878">You shorted Death.</font>

628
00:53:41,093 --> 00:53:43,767
<font color="#787878">So you let Death
have somebody else in your place....</font>

629
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:46,933
<font color="#787878">and then you take their spot
in the realm of the living.</font>

630
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:50,945
<font color="#787878">All the days and years
that they have yet to live.</font>

631
00:53:51,103 --> 00:53:54,698
<font color="#787878">And they take your place in death.</font>

632
00:53:54,857 --> 00:53:56,450
<font color="#787878">Then the books are balanced.</font>

633
00:53:56,608 --> 00:54:01,580
<font color="#787878">Wait a minute. We kill someone, we get their life? Is that what you're telling me?</font>

634
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:04,037
<font color="#787878">I don't make the rules.</font>

635
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:10,252
<font color="#787878">I just clean up after the game is over.</font>

636
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:25,141
<font color="#787878">Maybe that's why
Candice and Isaac are dead.</font>

637
00:54:25,554 --> 00:54:28,808
<font color="#787878">They weren't supposed to survive,
and now it's coming after the rest of us.</font>

638
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:30,893
<font color="#787878">No.</font>

639
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:33,061
<font color="#787878">No, not all of us.</font>

640
00:54:33,729 --> 00:54:35,572
<font color="#787878">Molly made it, she didn't die.</font>

641
00:54:35,731 --> 00:54:37,074
<font color="#787878">What?</font>

642
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:42,618
<font color="#787878">Well, when I had that vision,
or premonition, or whatever it was....</font>

643
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:46,996
<font color="#787878">I got you across
before the bridge collapsed.</font>

644
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:48,285
<font color="#787878">You survived.</font>

645
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:50,670
<font color="#787878">You saved her?</font>

646
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:54,504
<font color="#787878">Why, because you decided that she
deserved to live more than the rest of us?</font>

647
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:57,465
<font color="#787878">That's not what he's saying. I don't deserve to live more than anyone.</font>

648
00:54:57,628 --> 00:54:59,301
<font color="#787878">You deserve to live
more than Candice.</font>

649
00:54:59,463 --> 00:55:00,635
<font color="#787878">Whoa, Peter, hang on.</font>

650
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:03,176
<font color="#787878">No, look, guys, come on.</font>

651
00:55:03,342 --> 00:55:05,310
<font color="#787878">You're not drinking the Kool-Aid,
are you?</font>

652
00:55:05,469 --> 00:55:08,723
<font color="#787878">Killing people
to survive Death's list. Really?</font>

653
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:13,569
<font color="#787878">I may not know what's going on,
but it's not what that guy's selling.</font>

654
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:16,776
<font color="#787878">Yeah? What else is it, then?</font>

655
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:22,824
<font color="#787878">Shit.</font>

656
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:24,363
<font color="#787878">We need to tell Olivia.</font>

657
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:26,327
<font color="#787878">Come on.</font>

658
00:55:30,369 --> 00:55:31,916
<font color="#787878">My forms are all signed.</font>

659
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:35,379
<font color="#787878">I see that it's been quite a while since your first consultation.</font>

660
00:55:35,541 --> 00:55:37,885
<font color="#787878">What made you decide
to take the leap today?</font>

661
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:42,306
<font color="#787878">Uh, well, a lot is going on in my life....</font>

662
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:45,684
<font color="#787878">and I just don't wanna miss anything....</font>

663
00:55:45,843 --> 00:55:47,140
<font color="#787878">you know, important.</font>

664
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:48,975
<font color="#787878">Same reason I had it done myself.</font>

665
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:53,267
<font color="#787878">~ Come on in back. Let's get you started.
~ Okay.</font>

666
00:55:54,268 --> 00:55:55,360
<font color="#787878">Oh.</font>

667
00:55:59,857 --> 00:56:02,827
<font color="#787878">~ Yep, that's the first step.
~ You'll never need those again.</font>

668
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,624
<font color="#787878">Here we are. Come on in.</font>

669
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:21,215
<font color="#787878">What's with these?</font>

670
00:56:22,546 --> 00:56:25,015
<font color="#787878">Oh, just for some of
our younger patients.</font>

671
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:30,179
<font color="#787878">And, um, sometimes our older ones too. Come on.</font>

672
00:56:40,981 --> 00:56:42,403
<font color="#787878">What was that?</font>

673
00:56:42,566 --> 00:56:44,159
<font color="#787878">Relax.</font>

674
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:47,162
<font color="#787878">You know, it looks a lot worse
than it really is.</font>

675
00:56:47,321 --> 00:56:51,667
<font color="#787878">Okay, I'm gently going to
position your head....</font>

676
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:54,874
<font color="#787878">and I want you to tell me....</font>

677
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:57,873
<font color="#787878">when this feels snug.</font>

678
00:56:58,040 --> 00:56:59,462
<font color="#787878">I can't move my head.</font>

679
00:56:59,625 --> 00:57:02,469
<font color="#787878">Perfect. Just what we want.</font>

680
00:57:04,463 --> 00:57:06,386
<font color="#787878">There we go.</font>

681
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:10,178
<font color="#787878">Okay, now comes the fun part.
Here comes a drop.</font>

682
00:57:10,928 --> 00:57:14,774
<font color="#787878">And you will feel a little numbness in your eye....</font>

683
00:57:14,932 --> 00:57:16,400
<font color="#787878">which is a good thing.</font>

684
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:33,746
<font color="#787878">Deep breath.</font>

685
00:57:38,372 --> 00:57:39,794
<font color="#787878">Relax.</font>

686
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:47,638
<font color="#787878">Very good.</font>

687
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:55,514
<font color="#787878">Thattagirl.</font>

688
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:06,241
<font color="#787878">There.</font>

689
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,119
<font color="#787878">That's not so bad, is it?</font>

690
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:22,708
<font color="#787878">Looks good.</font>

691
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:33,185
<font color="#787878">~ What was that?
~ Just relax, Olivia.</font>

692
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:35,812
<font color="#787878">I'm just gonna enter some data into....</font>

693
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:41,317
<font color="#787878">Dottie!</font>

694
00:58:42,686 --> 00:58:44,063
<font color="#787878">Dot....</font>

695
00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:46,903
<font color="#787878">Do you know what?
My assistant's given me an incomplete file.</font>

696
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:48,817
<font color="#787878">I'll be right back.</font>

697
00:58:50,694 --> 00:58:52,947
<font color="#787878">Hold on, you're leaving?!</font>

698
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:26,272
<font color="#787878">Is that supposed to be happening?!</font>

699
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:07,817
<font color="#787878">Help me!</font>

700
01:00:19,783 --> 01:00:21,456
<font color="#787878">Olivia Castle. Where is she?</font>

701
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:22,744
<font color="#787878">She might be in danger.</font>

702
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:25,289
<font color="#787878">She's fine.
We do this kind of procedure all the time.</font>

703
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:35,511
<font color="#787878">Help me!</font>

704
01:00:36,216 --> 01:00:37,809
<font color="#787878">Help me!</font>

705
01:00:56,278 --> 01:00:58,121
<font color="#787878">This has never happened before.</font>

706
01:01:02,868 --> 01:01:04,495
<font color="#787878">Sam.</font>

707
01:01:05,579 --> 01:01:07,877
<font color="#787878">Stay with me tonight, please.</font>

708
01:01:08,999 --> 01:01:10,842
<font color="#787878">Of course.</font>

709
01:01:15,714 --> 01:01:17,762
<font color="#787878">Five different systems had to go wrong....</font>

710
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:21,804
<font color="#787878">for that laser to fail us
so spectacularly. Five.</font>

711
01:01:21,970 --> 01:01:23,722
<font color="#787878">What do you want from us?</font>

712
01:01:23,889 --> 01:01:26,187
<font color="#787878">I want you to tell me
what you think is going on.</font>

713
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:29,068
<font color="#787878">Two deaths? Okay, all right.
That's a coincidence.</font>

714
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:32,106
<font color="#787878">Three? That's a pattern.</font>

715
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:46,620
<font color="#787878">Now....</font>

716
01:01:47,329 --> 01:01:49,627
<font color="#787878">I know you two didn't do this.</font>

717
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:52,129
<font color="#787878">All right?</font>

718
01:01:53,501 --> 01:01:55,879
<font color="#787878">But I think you know something.</font>

719
01:01:58,548 --> 01:01:59,720
<font color="#787878">What is it?</font>

720
01:02:01,801 --> 01:02:04,270
<font color="#787878">We don't know anything.</font>

721
01:02:04,888 --> 01:02:07,141
<font color="#787878">Take a guess.</font>

722
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:16,483
<font color="#787878">We think we weren't supposed to survive on that bridge.</font>

723
01:02:17,817 --> 01:02:18,864
<font color="#787878">What?</font>

724
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:23,828
<font color="#787878">And now something
is trying to set it right.</font>

725
01:02:25,325 --> 01:02:27,077
<font color="#787878">"Something"?</font>

726
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:30,463
<font color="#787878">That's all you got?</font>

727
01:02:30,664 --> 01:02:31,881
<font color="#787878">Right now, yeah.</font>

728
01:02:32,832 --> 01:02:37,508
<font color="#787878">But if you come up
with any other explanations, let us know.</font>

729
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:42,301
<font color="#787878">Thank you.</font>

730
01:02:48,515 --> 01:02:50,313
<font color="#787878">"Something."</font>

731
01:02:59,234 --> 01:03:00,406
<font color="#787878">Hey.</font>

732
01:03:02,404 --> 01:03:03,826
<font color="#787878">Been up long?</font>

733
01:03:05,949 --> 01:03:10,625
<font color="#787878">Uh, I don't know. I couldn't sleep. I just kept thinking about the bridge.</font>

734
01:03:14,416 --> 01:03:17,295
<font color="#787878">Sam, you can't do this to yourself.</font>

735
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:21,431
<font color="#787878">No. No, no, no. I was thinking about, in the premonition....</font>

736
01:03:22,257 --> 01:03:26,353
<font color="#787878">we all got off the bus,
but the ground gave way and Candice fell.</font>

737
01:03:27,721 --> 01:03:29,473
<font color="#787878">Then the bus tipped over.</font>

738
01:03:30,598 --> 01:03:33,647
<font color="#787878">And Isaac, he never got off the bus. He went with it.</font>

739
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:35,187
<font color="#787878">What are you getting at?</font>

740
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:38,482
<font color="#787878">I know that there was just
so much going on....</font>

741
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:42,361
<font color="#787878">Look, I know that I helped you across.</font>

742
01:03:42,902 --> 01:03:45,746
<font color="#787878">Then I reached back for Olivia.</font>

743
01:03:46,323 --> 01:03:48,667
<font color="#787878">But she didn't make it. She fell.</font>

744
01:03:51,161 --> 01:03:53,914
<font color="#787878">So first was Candice.</font>

745
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:57,797
<font color="#787878">Then Isaac.</font>

746
01:03:59,169 --> 01:04:00,261
<font color="#787878">Then Olivia.</font>

747
01:04:01,755 --> 01:04:03,507
<font color="#787878">They're dying in order.</font>

748
01:04:04,758 --> 01:04:06,510
<font color="#787878">Who dies after Olivia?</font>

749
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:44,589
<font color="#787878">Roy, would you come
to the control room, please?</font>

750
01:04:44,756 --> 01:04:47,475
<font color="#787878">Uh-oh, Roy, that's the boss.
~ You in trouble, Roy.</font>

751
01:05:04,025 --> 01:05:06,278
<font color="#787878">Okay, schoolboy,
what do you wanna talk to me about?</font>

752
01:05:06,444 --> 01:05:09,243
<font color="#787878">~ What is with your timecard?
~ Let's talk about my timecard.</font>

753
01:05:09,406 --> 01:05:11,875
<font color="#787878">You out my hours,
which means you cut my pay!</font>

754
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:13,205
<font color="#787878">I cut everyone's hours, okay?</font>

755
01:05:13,368 --> 01:05:16,497
<font color="#787878">Corporate has us operating at less than 50 percent until this thing blows over.</font>

756
01:05:16,663 --> 01:05:18,665
<font color="#787878">My bookie ain't operating at 50 percent.</font>

757
01:05:18,832 --> 01:05:21,335
<font color="#787878">~ My dumb kid ain't operating at 50 percent.
~ Roy.</font>

758
01:05:21,501 --> 01:05:24,596
<font color="#787878">My ex-wife, she's taking 50 percent, so I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.</font>

759
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:25,880
<font color="#787878">No, we gotta move, man.</font>

760
01:05:26,047 --> 01:05:29,392
<font color="#787878">~ Hey, I'm not going anywhere. Hey!
~ Look, we gotta move! Gotta move!</font>

761
01:05:29,551 --> 01:05:30,848
<font color="#787878">We gotta move now!</font>

762
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:43,190
<font color="#787878">Roy! You okay down there?</font>

763
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:49,404
<font color="#787878">~ Hey, Dennis?
~ Hey.</font>

764
01:05:51,573 --> 01:05:53,541
<font color="#787878">They're closing us down.</font>

765
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:54,997
<font color="#787878">They're shutting down the plant?</font>

766
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:59,461
<font color="#787878">Not the plant, just us.
Just sales and administration.</font>

767
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:01,295
<font color="#787878">Can you believe it? Us?</font>

768
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:03,631
<font color="#787878">It's the factory guys
that usually get laid off.</font>

769
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:05,340
<font color="#787878">Not us, we're supposed to be safe.</font>

770
01:06:05,503 --> 01:06:07,881
<font color="#787878">Yeah, Dennis, we got bigger problems.</font>

771
01:06:08,715 --> 01:06:10,467
<font color="#787878">Olivia and Isaac are dead.</font>

772
01:06:11,468 --> 01:06:12,560
<font color="#787878">Who's Isaac?</font>

773
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:15,814
<font color="#787878">Isaac Palmer, tech support.</font>

774
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:18,142
<font color="#787878">Wasn't he dead already?</font>

775
01:06:18,308 --> 01:06:19,685
<font color="#787878">No, Dennis.</font>

776
01:06:19,893 --> 01:06:25,195
<font color="#787878">Listen, it's going to happen to us too if we don't do something about it.</font>

777
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:29,160
<font color="#787878">Yeah, I understand.
Listen, it's called survivor's guilt.</font>

778
01:06:29,319 --> 01:06:33,415
<font color="#787878">No. No, guilt doesn't kill you.</font>

779
01:06:33,573 --> 01:06:35,541
<font color="#787878">Obviously, you've never met my in-laws.</font>

780
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:37,498
<font color="#787878">I'm not fucking around here, Dennis.</font>

781
01:06:37,952 --> 01:06:39,545
<font color="#787878">Anyone could be next.</font>

782
01:06:39,704 --> 01:06:42,332
<font color="#787878">It could be you. Understand?</font>

783
01:06:42,499 --> 01:06:43,967
<font color="#787878">Nobody's safe.</font>

784
01:06:44,125 --> 01:06:45,672
<font color="#787878">What are you talking about?</font>

785
01:06:47,962 --> 01:06:50,681
<font color="#787878">We weren't supposed to survive
that bridge collapse.</font>

786
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:53,719
<font color="#787878">And so now it's kill or be killed.</font>

787
01:06:54,302 --> 01:06:56,475
<font color="#787878">You get that, Dennis?</font>

788
01:06:57,597 --> 01:06:58,644
<font color="#787878">Whatever.</font>

789
01:06:58,806 --> 01:07:01,650
<font color="#787878">I warned you.
Do whatever you wanna do.</font>

790
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:07,198
<font color="#787878">I will.</font>

791
01:07:11,986 --> 01:07:14,284
<font color="#787878">Hey, Agent Block, it's Dennis. Um....</font>

792
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:18,372
<font color="#787878">Listen, Pete just came in here
and he's just completely lost it.</font>

793
01:07:18,535 --> 01:07:21,414
<font color="#787878">He's yelling about "kill or be killed."</font>

794
01:07:21,579 --> 01:07:24,503
<font color="#787878">Oh, yeah,
it definitely sounded like a threat.</font>

795
01:07:41,474 --> 01:07:42,566
<font color="#787878">What happened?</font>

796
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:45,649
<font color="#787878">~ I don't know. I don't know.
~ It just happened so fast.</font>

797
01:07:45,812 --> 01:07:48,531
<font color="#787878">~ Nathan. Are you okay?
~ Yeah.</font>

798
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:52,365
<font color="#787878">~ We heard, and we thought....
~ No. No, uh, I'm good.</font>

799
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:54,738
<font color="#787878">Did you kill him?</font>

800
01:07:55,113 --> 01:07:56,239
<font color="#787878">What?</font>

801
01:07:56,406 --> 01:07:59,000
<font color="#787878">No. No, I just....</font>

802
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:02,037
<font color="#787878">It was just timing, you know?
He got in the way and....</font>

803
01:08:02,203 --> 01:08:03,500
<font color="#787878">No, you did, didn't you?</font>

804
01:08:03,663 --> 01:08:07,042
<font color="#787878">You saw it coming, and then you took his life. You put him in the way.</font>

805
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:08,835
<font color="#787878">No, I didn't really do anything.</font>

806
01:08:09,002 --> 01:08:11,846
<font color="#787878">~ Did you or didn't you?
~ Hey, Peter, calm down.</font>

807
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:13,382
<font color="#787878">Did you or didn't you?</font>

808
01:08:16,217 --> 01:08:18,265
<font color="#787878">Did you or didn't you?</font>

809
01:08:19,178 --> 01:08:22,102
<font color="#787878">Yes. I think I did.</font>

810
01:08:22,932 --> 01:08:24,184
<font color="#787878">I killed him.</font>

811
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:28,275
<font color="#787878">So if the theory works,
then you traded spots.</font>

812
01:08:28,438 --> 01:08:32,113
<font color="#787878">He should have your death,
and you should have his years.</font>

813
01:08:32,859 --> 01:08:34,156
<font color="#787878">How do we know for sure?</font>

814
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:36,196
<font color="#787878">I think there's an order to these deaths.</font>

815
01:08:37,614 --> 01:08:40,584
<font color="#787878">They mirror the order everyone died in on the bridge.</font>

816
01:08:40,742 --> 01:08:42,540
<font color="#787878">Then who would be next?</font>

817
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:46,623
<font color="#787878">Who wants to be first to tell me
what the hell happened?</font>

818
01:08:47,081 --> 01:08:48,128
<font color="#787878">Who is it, Sam?</font>

819
01:08:48,291 --> 01:08:49,338
<font color="#787878">Who's what?</font>

820
01:08:54,631 --> 01:08:57,134
<font color="#787878">Dennis! It was Dennis.</font>

821
01:08:57,592 --> 01:08:59,560
<font color="#787878">No shit.</font>

822
01:09:00,595 --> 01:09:02,347
<font color="#787878">Jesus.</font>

823
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,443
<font color="#787878">Why are you fighting me on this?</font>

824
01:09:07,602 --> 01:09:09,980
<font color="#787878">You're not seriously going to work, are you?</font>

825
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:14,447
<font color="#787878">Molly, Isaac died on a massage table.</font>

826
01:09:14,609 --> 01:09:17,283
<font color="#787878">If Death is gonna come for me,
I don't think it matters where I am.</font>

827
01:09:17,445 --> 01:09:19,197
<font color="#787878">You have to do something.</font>

828
01:09:19,364 --> 01:09:22,083
<font color="#787878">~ What, kill someone so I can live?
~ No, of course not.</font>

829
01:09:22,867 --> 01:09:24,995
<font color="#787878">We'll just have to
figure something else out.</font>

830
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:27,255
<font color="#787878">I have figured it out.</font>

831
01:09:27,705 --> 01:09:30,675
<font color="#787878">Something saved me on that bridge.</font>

832
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:32,676
<font color="#787878">Maybe it doesn't want me to die.</font>

833
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:36,472
<font color="#787878">Maybe.</font>

834
01:09:36,631 --> 01:09:39,510
<font color="#787878">We can't live our lives in fear, Moll.</font>

835
01:09:41,886 --> 01:09:46,187
<font color="#787878">So if it happens tomorrow,
or 50 years from now, whatever.</font>

836
01:09:46,349 --> 01:09:48,568
<font color="#787878">As long as we're together....</font>

837
01:09:49,811 --> 01:09:51,028
<font color="#787878">I'll be okay.</font>

838
01:09:53,731 --> 01:09:56,575
<font color="#787878">Right? Why don't you come by
after my shift....</font>

839
01:09:56,734 --> 01:09:58,828
<font color="#787878">and I'll make you
a nice late dinner, okay?</font>

840
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:08,963
<font color="#787878">All right, give me this.</font>

841
01:10:17,922 --> 01:10:20,175
<font color="#787878">~ Excuse me.
~ We don't have to wait for them, do we?</font>

842
01:10:20,341 --> 01:10:22,639
<font color="#787878">~ I'll let you know.
~ Okay, thank you.</font>

843
01:10:25,471 --> 01:10:27,815
<font color="#787878">To the girl on the run</font>

844
01:10:38,359 --> 01:10:39,827
<font color="#787878">Veal's ready, take it out.</font>

845
01:10:39,986 --> 01:10:42,080
<font color="#787878">Samuel. Get to work on the bourguignon.</font>

846
01:10:50,413 --> 01:10:51,630
<font color="#787878">Whoa.</font>

847
01:10:52,039 --> 01:10:53,086
<font color="#787878">Pan coming through.</font>

848
01:10:54,709 --> 01:10:56,382
<font color="#787878">Whoa, watch yourself.</font>

849
01:11:07,138 --> 01:11:09,482
<font color="#787878">~ Okay. Meat's in. Pick it up, eh?
~ Yes, sir.</font>

850
01:11:20,359 --> 01:11:22,032
<font color="#787878">Whoa.</font>

851
01:11:22,195 --> 01:11:24,038
<font color="#787878">That could've been ugly, huh? Ha, ha.</font>

852
01:11:24,197 --> 01:11:26,871
<font color="#787878">Yeah. Could've been.</font>

853
01:11:31,871 --> 01:11:33,248
<font color="#787878">Vincent, speed it up, okay?</font>

854
01:11:40,588 --> 01:11:41,885
<font color="#787878">Whoa, hey!</font>

855
01:12:05,446 --> 01:12:07,448
<font color="#787878">Hey, clean that grate.</font>

856
01:12:15,915 --> 01:12:18,919
<font color="#787878">~ Just met your girlfriend.
~ Oh.</font>

857
01:12:19,085 --> 01:12:22,009
<font color="#787878">Are you sure it's okay
if I make her a little something?</font>

858
01:12:22,630 --> 01:12:24,678
<font color="#787878">Make sure to clean up afterward.</font>

859
01:12:24,841 --> 01:12:27,594
<font color="#787878">I will, of course. Thank you.</font>

860
01:12:28,886 --> 01:12:30,263
<font color="#787878">And, chef....</font>

861
01:12:31,848 --> 01:12:33,725
<font color="#787878">The apprenticeship.</font>

862
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:36,394
<font color="#787878">If the offer still stands....</font>

863
01:12:36,561 --> 01:12:37,904
<font color="#787878">I'd like to take it.</font>

864
01:12:39,564 --> 01:12:41,066
<font color="#787878">It's yours.</font>

865
01:12:55,788 --> 01:12:57,256
<font color="#787878">Okay, no more suspense.</font>

866
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:01,089
<font color="#787878">What you've been waiting for.</font>

867
01:13:02,837 --> 01:13:05,306
<font color="#787878">Wow. You're gonna help me
with this, right?</font>

868
01:13:05,464 --> 01:13:06,932
<font color="#787878">Yeah, sure, if you want me to....</font>

869
01:13:07,091 --> 01:13:08,593
<font color="#787878">No? You don't want me to....?</font>

870
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:10,557
<font color="#787878">So how's your French?</font>

871
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:13,306
<font color="#787878">Heh. Terrible.</font>

872
01:13:13,472 --> 01:13:17,147
<font color="#787878">Oh, good. Well, then,
we can be terrible together.</font>

873
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:20,484
<font color="#787878">~ Why?
~ I took the internship.</font>

874
01:13:20,646 --> 01:13:24,571
<font color="#787878">What? Sam, that's amazing.</font>

875
01:13:27,945 --> 01:13:29,743
<font color="#787878">I'm so proud of you.</font>

876
01:13:46,923 --> 01:13:49,676
<font color="#787878">~ Peter.
~ Hey.</font>

877
01:13:51,469 --> 01:13:54,518
<font color="#787878">You okay, man?
You look a little, uh, upset.</font>

878
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:58,605
<font color="#787878">Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just a rough couple days.</font>

879
01:13:59,310 --> 01:14:01,984
<font color="#787878">Yeah. Yeah, for everyone.</font>

880
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:04,816
<font color="#787878">For some more than others.</font>

881
01:14:05,608 --> 01:14:07,030
<font color="#787878">Do you mind if I come in?</font>

882
01:14:07,193 --> 01:14:09,537
<font color="#787878">Oh, yeah, of course. Yeah, come in.</font>

883
01:14:15,201 --> 01:14:16,703
<font color="#787878">Here, have a seat.</font>

884
01:14:17,536 --> 01:14:19,129
<font color="#787878">Thanks.</font>

885
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:24,544
<font color="#787878">Hey, Peter.</font>

886
01:14:25,711 --> 01:14:27,509
<font color="#787878">Hi, Molly.</font>

887
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:46,111
<font color="#787878">Peter, can I get you anything to eat? I can make you up some pasta.</font>

888
01:14:46,732 --> 01:14:50,236
<font color="#787878">Uh, no. No, no, no. I'm good.
Uh, thank you.</font>

889
01:14:51,737 --> 01:14:53,580
<font color="#787878">Uh, I'm sorry. I just thought....</font>

890
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:56,333
<font color="#787878">It's good that you're here.
You shouldn't be alone right now.</font>

891
01:14:56,951 --> 01:14:59,420
<font color="#787878">Yeah, you know,
I'm surprised I'm here at all.</font>

892
01:15:00,830 --> 01:15:02,252
<font color="#787878">Uh....</font>

893
01:15:02,415 --> 01:15:04,258
<font color="#787878">Still alive, I mean.</font>

894
01:15:04,417 --> 01:15:05,760
<font color="#787878">I'm next to go, right?</font>

895
01:15:07,086 --> 01:15:08,759
<font color="#787878">It's me and then you, isn't it?</font>

896
01:15:11,549 --> 01:15:16,396
<font color="#787878">Anyways, uh, I was up all last night, you know....</font>

897
01:15:16,554 --> 01:15:19,728
<font color="#787878">thinking about if I could really do it.</font>

~ Take someone else's life.</font>

899
01:15:24,311 --> 01:15:29,568
<font color="#787878">If I could actually kill some stranger, replace their life with my own.</font>

900
01:15:30,526 --> 01:15:32,449
<font color="#787878">And I thought about it.</font>

901
01:15:33,237 --> 01:15:35,239
<font color="#787878">And I convinced myself that....</font>

902
01:15:36,615 --> 01:15:38,117
<font color="#787878">yeah, I could.</font>

903
01:15:40,786 --> 01:15:43,209
<font color="#787878">So I went on a walk.</font>

904
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:46,125
<font color="#787878">You know, nowhere in particular....</font>

905
01:15:46,292 --> 01:15:49,171
<font color="#787878">but every couple of minutes,
an opportunity would just present itself</font>

906
01:15:49,336 --> 01:15:52,135
<font color="#787878">Heh. Like clockwork.</font>

907
01:15:52,548 --> 01:15:55,643
<font color="#787878">I could just grab somebody
and pull them into an alley.</font>

908
01:15:56,218 --> 01:15:59,813
<font color="#787878">Or just shove somebody off a curb
into traffic.</font>

909
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:01,978
<font color="#787878">You know?</font>

910
01:16:02,808 --> 01:16:04,105
<font color="#787878">It'd be real easy.</font>

911
01:16:07,146 --> 01:16:09,399
<font color="#787878">Peter, what did you do?</font>

912
01:16:17,114 --> 01:16:19,537
<font color="#787878">~ Did you....?

914
01:16:24,663 --> 01:16:26,506
<font color="#787878">I realized that....</font>

915
01:16:26,665 --> 01:16:29,589
<font color="#787878">I couldn't kill somebody
that didn't deserve to die.</font>

916
01:16:31,670 --> 01:16:35,391
<font color="#787878">And I thought about Candice,
and I thought, "Wait a minute.</font>

921
01:16:49,855 --> 01:16:52,028
<font color="#787878">No, of course you don't.</font>

922
01:16:54,985 --> 01:16:56,407
<font color="#787878">Well....</font>

923
01:16:57,571 --> 01:17:03,704
<font color="#787878">none of us deserve to die,
then why is it....</font>

924
01:17:04,995 --> 01:17:07,965
<font color="#787878">that you deserve to live, Molly?</font>

925
01:17:09,875 --> 01:17:11,172
<font color="#787878">You said it yourself....</font>

926
01:17:12,378 --> 01:17:13,550
<font color="#787878">you don't.</font>

927

936
01:17:49,373 --> 01:17:51,751
<font color="#787878">This is crazy, Peter. Don't do this.</font>

937
01:17:52,918 --> 01:17:56,513
<font color="#787878">Just think for a minute, all right?</font>

938
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:58,265
<font color="#787878">You are not a killer.</font>

<font color="#787878">Yeah.</font>

965
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:30,070
<font color="#787878">I guess I do.</font>

966
01:22:46,044 --> 01:22:47,546
<font color="#787878">Do you mind if I take the window seat?</font>

971
01:22:58,182 --> 01:22:59,399
<font color="#787878">Get off him!</font>

972
01:22:59,558 --> 01:23:00,810
<font color="#787878">Settle down!</font>

~ Get off the plane!</font>

974
01:23:04,021 --> 01:23:06,490
<font color="#787878">Get off the plane. You don't understand!</font>

<font color="#787878">~ What's all that about?
~ I have no idea.</font>

977

<font color="#787878">Ladies and gentlemen,
we'll be pulling away from the gate as....</font>

978
01:23:23,665 --> 01:23:24,757
<font color="#787878">Here we go.</font>

979
01:23:24,958 --> 01:23:27,507
<font color="#787878">The cabin lights
have been dimmed for takeoff</font>

984
01:24:18,387 --> 01:24:23,063
<font color="#787878">Those passengers who got off the plane earlier, what was that all about?</font>

985
01:24:23,225 --> 01:24:25,899
<font color="#787878">A kid had
a panic attack and wanted off the plane.</font>

986

<font color="#787878">Said he had some kind of vision.</font>
