the right thing.

160

Rebuild the bridges,
take back the city.

161
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,789
Just have to be patient.

162

Hmm, so what we're hearing

murdered Butch
right in front of her,

236
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,159

can't go down there.

I have so few
bullets.

302
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,878
Do I spend one on him?

303
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,509
Is it worth it?

304
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,633
I already know it's not.

305
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,515
My other question is:

306
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,956
Why are you here?
It's not to steal the generator.

307
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,237
Why would I
want light?

308
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,909
Fear lives in darkness.

309
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,957
So what then?
You came for our supplies?

310
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,196
Exactly so.

311
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,154
But since I'm here,
I'll also take your life.

312
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,592
(grunting)

313
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,872
It's been a while since you
tasted my toxin, Captain.

314
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,959
What are you scared of now?

315
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,800
Not you.

316
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,598

317
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,399

Hey! Hey!

- (gunfire, bullets ricocheting)

321

Go! Move! Go!

328
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,360
(grunting)

329
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,956
Hello?

330
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,230
Scag?

331
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,354
Hey... hey, guys?

332
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,390
Scag?

333
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,599
Hey, guys, this isn't...
this isn't funny.

334
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,233
(grunting)

335
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,800
- (high-pitched ringing)
- (screams)

336
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,951
(grunting, gasping)

337
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,839
Go back! Go back!

338
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,753
(panting, frantic chatter)

339
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,517
(tires squealing,
sirens wailing)

340
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,955
(clamoring)

341
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,998
First their government
abandons them,

342
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,120
and then some freak
dressed like a scarecrow

343
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,436
steals their grub.

344
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,000
I'd be pissed, too.

345
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,720
So where are we?

346
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,436
At current consumption,

347
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,193
we've got a week of food.

348
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,750
Go to half rations.

349
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,440
We're already at half rations.

350
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,270
Cut 'em again.

351
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,715
The people won't be happy.

352
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,434
I haven't been happy
in ten years.

353
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,000
At least they'll be alive.

354
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,470
All right, that buys us
two weeks. Then what?

355
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:44,999
Jim, at this point,

356
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,656
the bastards across the
river are gonna have to

357
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,433
- step up and help.
- Why start now?

358
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,640
They haven't before.

359
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,512
For the love of God, we...
because we stayed

360
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,114
to do the job
they wouldn't.

361
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,437
Huh? And now they're just
gonna sit back and watch

362
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,319
while we starve or
tear ourselves apart?

363
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,576
Because that's
what's gonna happen.

364
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,636
I know, Harv.

365
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,920
But right now, we have to tell
these people something.

366
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,514
BRUCE: Tell them
help is coming.

367
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,709
I'll fly in supplies.

368
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,356
We tried that.

369
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,273
We couldn't even get
permission to take off.

370
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,000
Zero tolerance.
Nothing in or out.

371
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,880
BRUCE: Well, I'm not
asking for permission.

372
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,800
It's ready.

373
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,456
Alfred's already radioed
to have it delivered

374
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,596
from our
east bay hangar.

375
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,000
We can have a supply chopper
here within hours.

376
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,874
Man, it is nice to have
a billionaire around.

377
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,080
Even if it succeeds,

378
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,360
the government's
gonna find out.

379
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,800
It's a one-time solution.

380
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,237
Scarecrow's men
didn't just take food.

381
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,358
They stole medicine
from the clinic.

382
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,839
There are people in pain.

383
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,271
Harvey, tell the people
help is on the way.

384
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,640
You got it.

385
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,880
How's Selina?

386
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,200
She's strong.

387
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,000
She'll pull through.

388
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,080
Doc says the surgery
was a success.

389
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,030
My spine's not gonna
turn to jelly.

390
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,951
Still never be able
to walk again, so...

391
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,754
that's a bummer.

392
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,397
There's limited resources here.

393
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,790
But there's hope
once we join the mainland.

394
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,880
Gee.

395
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,311
For a second there,
I was worried.

396
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,071
Selina, I know you're in pain.

397
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,472
Some medicine is on its way.

398
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,239
You know what's funny?

399
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,710
Jeremiah shot me to get to you.

400
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,277
After all the things
I've done...

401
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,596
...what did me in
was being your friend.

402
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,756
I just wish
Jeremiah killed me.

403
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,800
Doctors can't help her.

404
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,000
She needs the witch.

405
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,913
(indistinct chatter)

406
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,270
MAN:
Thank you.

407
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,875
How's the mood?

408
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,360
They're hanging
in there.

409
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,393
They love their
Jim Gordon.

410
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,237
But if that chopper
doesn't come, it'll be bad.

411
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,150
It'll come.

412
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,757
(operatic music playing)

413
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,240
(groans)

414
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,435
Feels good.

415
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,839
Missing something, though.

416
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,719
Put a knife on it.

417
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,872
- (laughing)
- (door opens)

418
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,555
Another shutdown at the factory.

419
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:41,397
A worker fell
into a hydraulic press.

420
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,836
It appears
he passed out from hunger.

421
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:47,194
Sir, I worry if we don't
increase the food allowance...

422
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,279
Mr. Penn,

423
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:51,079
I feel for all
of our workers.

424
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,558
But I cannot give
what I do not have.

425
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,593
Overcooked!

426
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,189
(dog pants, whines)

427
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,360
(sighs)

428
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,679
Edward.

429
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,273
(laughs)

430
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,480
Such a good boy.

431
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,438
(laughing)

432
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,320
Quality at the factory
is also suffering.

433
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,911
- More misfires...
- Nonsense.

434
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,315
- (gunshot)
- (whimpers)

435
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,560
Our rounds
are fine.

436
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,713
And now you've upset Edward.

437
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,320
- (pops)
- (groans)

438
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,949
As you see,

439
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,834
more misfires.

440
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,754
- Sir, if we don't give better quality...
- Shut up.

441
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,360
Sir?

442
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,193
- Sir?
- Shh, shut up!

443
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,400
Shut up.

444
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,550
Do you hear that?

445
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,755
(exhales)

446
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,999
You said yourself, Penguin has
locked himself in City Hall

447
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,992
- with a small army.
- I know that.

448
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,117
- And I know you miss Butch.
- Do you?

449
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,232
Because he only
did it to hurt me.

450
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,279
That's why I have
to make it right.

451
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,796
And how are you gonna do that
and not get killed?

452
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,240
I need you, too.

453
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,396
(helicopter whirring faintly
in distance)

454
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,040
(whirring grows closer)

455
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,399
Tabby, you hear me?

456
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,720
Is that a chopper?

457
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,316
There it is.

458
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,595
This is Bruce Wayne.

459
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,797
I'm at the GCPD.
We can see you.

460
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,433
PILOT (over radio):
<i>Copy that, Mr. Wayne.</i>

461
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,319
<i>We'll meet you
at the rendezvous point.</i>

462
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,395
PILOT:
<i>Mayday! Mayday!</i>

463
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,016
<i>We've been hit!
We're going down hard.</i>

464
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,056
- Harvey, the chopper went down.
- PILOT: <i>Mayday! Mayday!</i>

465
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,400
GORDON:
Get a team together now.

466
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,916
PILOT: <i>Brace for impact.
We're going down.</i>

467
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,355
Oh, my God.

468
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,870
Chopper went down
in Lo Boyz territory.

469
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,032
I expect we'll have to fight
our way in and out.

470
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,316
I know it's a lot to ask,

471
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,040
but without those
supplies, we're done.

472
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,096
Can we get some more ammo?
We're running dry down here.

473
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,952
Be happy you got what you got,
and get in.

474
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,077
GORDON: Alfred, I expected
to see Bruce here,

475
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,456
- wanting to come along.
- Well, you'd think, wouldn't you?

476
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,994
I mean, his chopper, his pilots.

477
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,856
Maybe he thought
you wouldn't allow it.

478
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,553
(engines starting)

479
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,757
Just keep an eye on things
while I'm gone.

480
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,520
(sirens whooping)

481
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,910
(whirring, crackling)

482
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,037
(indistinct chatter)

483
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,159
(tires squealing)

484
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,753
(car doors open)

485
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,669
Hello.

486
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:07,158
The Lo Boyz, is it?

487
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,320
(chuckles)

488
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,273
I suspect you know who I am.

489
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,479

492
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,029

00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,670
Jim.

499
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,516
I thought you might show up.

500
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,160
It is so good to
see you, old friend.

501
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,595
How are you faring
in these troubled times?

502
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,311
Tell your men to step away
from the chopper.

503
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,513
Sorry. Mouths to feed.

504
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,511
And you know all
about that, don't you?

505
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,230
I hear you are up

506
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,596
to your ears in refugees.

507
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,156
We're protecting children,
families.

508
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,674
We need those supplies.

509
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,118
You shouldn't have
shot it down, Oswald.

510

You think I did this?
(laughs)

511
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,520
No, no, no, no, no.

512
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,635
That would mean that I knew
a chopper was coming,

513
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,996
which I did not.
I mean, don't get me wrong,

514

we're still taking everything,

515
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,955
but I did not fire the shot.

516
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,270
It was an RPG.

517
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,159
Who else has that kind
of firepower?

518
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,276
Fair point.

519
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,639
But if it was me,

520
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,760
wouldn't I just admit it?

521

I mean,

522
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,437
it's not like
I'm going to be arrested.

523
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,595
Then who was it?

524
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,870
No idea.

525
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,231
Now, nice as it was catching up,

526
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,119
it's time you skedaddle.

527
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,954
While you can.

528
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,117
We are, uh, kind of
outgunned here, partner.

530

531
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,157

532
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,554

He thought
you were his friend!

540
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,832
- I was his friend!
- Liar!

541
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,277
You put a knife in
my mother's back.

His blood is on your hands!

You really think that I expected
to come here and walk away?

544
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,936
Jim, are you just
going to let her

545
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,713
kill me like this in cold blood?

546
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,153
Jim, listen to me.
You are not the only one

I may have pulled the trigger,

551
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,151
but you killed Butch.

552
