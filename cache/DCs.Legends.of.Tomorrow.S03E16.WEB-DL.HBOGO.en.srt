00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,840
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,480
The more the timeline's corrupted,

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,400
the weaker the prison
holding Mallus becomes.

4
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,560
Maybe these totems
are the keys to stopping him.

5
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,440
The Fire Totem wasn't meant for me.

6
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,720
Damien Darhk,
what has he promised you?

7
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,640
A chance to protect our village.

8
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,200
- No.
- We'll fix this.

9
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,280
We'll get your totem back.

10
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,480
- Gideon, delete file 354-Z.
- Yes, Director Hunter.

11
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,760
Sara can never find out
the truth about Ava.

12
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,760
- Look, I don't deserve you.
- Sara, yes you do.

13
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,480
No, Ava, I don't.

14
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,160
I'm not gonna do this, I'm sorry.

15
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,880
I am not just walking out
on the team, Ray.

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,760
She says, as she's literally
walking away.

17
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,680
Sara, we appreciate
that you may need a break

18
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,120
after what happened
with the Death Totem.

19
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,000
But this is the absolute worst time
for you to leave.

20
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,840
At least let us lock you up
in the brig.

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,440
We need you here now
more than ever.

22
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,800
Yeah, we've almost
won the totem race.

23
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,000
Which is exactly
why I need to go.

24
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,640
Look, we are so close
to gaining control over "the six"

25
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,160
and getting the upper hand on Mallus.

26
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,240
I just...

27
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,160
I need a day to clear my head.

28
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,480
Yeah, but who's gonna stop Mick
from burning down

29
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,600
the ship with the Fire Totem?

30
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,320
Someone's gonna have to fill in
the role of captain while I'm gone.

31
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,400
Oh, well, I... I hadn't
exactly thought I'd...

32
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,640
I'd pick up the mantle
this soon, but...

33
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,280
I'm putting Amaya in charge.

34
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,600
Good luck.

35
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,480
Sorry about that, big guy.

36
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,440
Hey, hi.

37
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,960
Do you think that maybe you
could do that somewhere else?

38
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,440
We do have a galley.

39
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,680
You want a dog?

40
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,520
It's pork.

41
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,880
So, what?

42
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,040
No, thank you.

43
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,560
Wow, I'm sure
that's what those ancient folks

44
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,600
had in mind when they created
the Fire Totem.

45
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,200
- Every man's gotta eat.
- There you are, Mick.

46
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,280
You ready?

47
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,080
- For what?
- Training.

48
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,120
Do you remember,
we spoke about learning to harness

49
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,520
the powers of the totem.

50
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,080
I got a new trick.

51
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,360
Pull my finger.

52
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,640
What?

53
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,720
Pull my finger.

54
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,760
Do not pull his finger.

55
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,960
Let's just say hot dogs aren't
the only thing he's learned

56
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,320
how to light on fire.

57
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,920
<i>Sorry to interrupt, Ms. Jiwe,</i>

58
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,880
<i>but Dr. Heywood requests
your presence in the library.</i>

59
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,760
Captain's duties are never over.

60
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,600
But, seeing as you're not busy...

61
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,360
No, no, no, please
don't... please don't ask me.

62
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,920
I can't think of anyone better
to learn to train a new totem bearer.

63
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,520
Yeah, sure.

64
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,200
I'll get right on it.

65
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,640
Good luck.

66
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,840
So, what's going on?

67
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,280
It's your granddaughter, Mari,
she's been hurt.

68
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,400
A minor wrinkle in the 2018 timeline.

69
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,480
How badly?

70
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,240
The article says she was burned
trying to save people

71
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,800
from a warehouse fire in Detroit.

72
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,640
Doesn't she have superpowers,
though?

73
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,200
This is all my fault.

74
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,920
Ever since I lost my totem,

75
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,320
the timeline must be
starting to solidify.

76
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,160
Which means, in this new reality,

77
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,800
the totem was never
passed down to her.

78
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,480
So, Mari is a vigilante
without her totem.

79
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,120
- I have to go and talk to her.
- What?

80
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,640
{\an5}No, you cannot talk
to your own granddaughter.

81
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,120
- That will cause...
- Unforeseen consequences.

82
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,280
I know, but how much worse
can things truly get?

83
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,040
{\an5}Sara put me in charge
while she steps away.

84
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,280
All the more reason
why you should stay on the ship.

85
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,000
Okay, I'll go to Detroit,
and I'll talk to her.

86
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,440
- And I'll... I'll help him.
- Yeah.

87
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,080
{\an5}There's nothing
this dynamic duo cannot do.

88
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,200
Okay, fine.

89
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,720
Just be careful.

90
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,320
Look, Sara, for what it's worth,

91
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,320
{\an5}I know it wasn't the real you
who tried to kill us.

92
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,560
That's just it, Ray.

93
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,960
That was the real me.

94
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,520
Which is why I need to...

95
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,400
Ms. Lance, it's Gary.

96
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,080
Sorry to drop in on you like this.

97
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,680
What're you doing,
open your eyes, Gary.

98
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,800
Oh, hi.

99
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,520
Sorry, I didn't wanna accidentally
portal into your quarters

100
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,720
and catch you and Director Sharpe,
you know...

101
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,400
- together.
- Well, you don't have to worry

102
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,400
about that anymore
because we broke up.

103
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,920
Wait, what, why didn't you tell us?

104
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,400
No, no, you guys can't break up.

105
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,080
I was shipping you so hard.

106
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,360
That's why you're leaving.

107
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,400
That is not why I'm leaving.

108
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,520
{\an5}And if you're looking for Ava,
I suggest you check her office.

109
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,760
Well, that's the thing.

110
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,080
She hasn't been to work
in a few days,

111
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,480
which is very unlike her.

112
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,080
{\an5}I've already been covering for her,
I forged her signature twice.

113
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,080
What am I supposed to do next,
put on a wig and pantsuit

114
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,160
and pretend I'm her?

115
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,200
- No, don't do that.
- What if she's in trouble?

116
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,560
{\an5}I mean, we already lost
Director Bennett.

117
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,640
What if Grodd got to her too?

118
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,720
Oh, my god, oh, my god...

119
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,440
Gary, Gary, deep breaths,
deep breaths.

120
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,760
Don't worry, Gary.

121
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,720
Because we're gonna find her.

122
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,080
"We" will find her?

123
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,080
DETROIT, 2018

124
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,720
Thanks for taking the time
to talk with us, Mr. McCabe.

125
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,480
Mari's resting.

126
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,800
I'll have someone come grab you
when she wakes up.

127
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,360
We're from "The Detroit Chronicle"
and we'd like to do a story

128
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,720
about your foster daughter's heroism.

129
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,960
To tell you the truth,

130
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,440
I wish she was less interested
in saving everyone else's lives

131
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,280
and more compelled
to protect her own.

132
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,880
Mari's a brave woman.

133
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,000
But maybe you should remind her

134
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,000
that there are police
and firefighters too.

135
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,880
{\an5}And that the safety of Detroit isn't,
you know, her responsibility.

136
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,600
You don't have to tell me that.

137
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,720
Sometimes I feel like my daughter,

138
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,640
she's walking around
with a target on her back.

139
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,720
Excuse me for a second.

140
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,760
TIME BUREAU

141
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,080
If Ava comes back and finds us
snooping through her office...

142
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,160
We're only snooping
to find out where she went.

143
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,280
What're you doing?

144
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,000
{\an5}I am hacking
into the Bureau's network

145
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,040
to access Ava's personnel file.

146
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,600
DIR. AVA SHAPE NOT FOUND

147
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,680
What is it?

148
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,120
Director Sharpe's personnel
file has been erased.

149
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,520
Someone deleted it remotely
from the Waverider.

150
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,000
Wow, she must've really
wanted to go off the radar.

151
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,280
Wait, you think Director Sharpe
erased her own file?

152
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,600
That's crazy.

153
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,600
{\an5}Yeah, so is putting on a wig
and impersonating your boss, Gary.

154
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,400
I didn't actually do it.

155
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,480
What are you doing?

156
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,080
Looking for clues
as to where she might've gone.

157
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,840
Birthday card
from her parents in Fresno.

158
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,280
Think she might've gone to Fresno?

159
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,360
Does that mean
we have to go to Fresno?

160
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,960
- You're sure you saw Kuasa?
- Yeah.

161
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,960
Just be on the lookout for
a badass in a leather outfit.

162
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,040
Or a suspicious puddle of water.

163
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,880
Hey, there she is!

164
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,200
I got her.

165
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,320
Dude, don't just stand there.

166
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,240
Hello.

167
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,080
Not so fast.

168
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,080
- Wally, wait, she's...
- Dangerous, I know.

169
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,080
As soon as I catch my breath,

170
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,760
we're gonna stop you
from hurting your sister.

171
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,240
Hurt Mari?

172
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,840
I'm here to protect her.

173
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,240
You idiots.

174
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,600
FRESNO, 2018

175
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,320
Well, this isn't exactly how I
imagined meeting Ava's parents.

176
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,560
Not that I imagined meeting
Ava's parents, I just, I...

177
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,240
Hello.

178
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,760
How can we help you?

179
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,560
Pam and Randy Sharpe?

180
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,280
Says so on our marriage license.

181
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,840
Looks like they stepped right out
of an L.L. Bean catalogue.

182
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,960
Now, we know where Director Sharpe
gets her perfect bone structure.

183
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,080
And you are?

184
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,600
We're friends of your daughter.

185
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,160
Well, unfortunately, Ava...

186
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,680
Hasn't shown up for work
in a few days,

187
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,920
and we're getting a little worried.

188
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,040
We haven't seen her in months.

189
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,280
I hope she's okay.

190
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,720
We were hoping
that we could come inside.

191
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,360
Maybe together we could figure out
where she's gone.

192
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,720
Sure. Pammy here just baked up
a storm of her famous cookies.

193
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,720
Snickerdoodles.

194
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,080
Come on in.

195
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,720
If you folks work with Ava,
you must work for the government.

196
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,480
Yes, we're... we're government suits.

197
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,000
Our daughter won't tell us
what she does.

198
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,560
It's all so "top secret."

199
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,880
You have so many photos of her.

200
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,360
Where was that one taken?

201
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,360
Oh, that's at the Grand Canyon.

202
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,200
Such a beautiful family.

203
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,720
Almost too good to be true.

204
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,560
Sara, why don't you try one
of Mrs. Sharpe's snickerdoodles?

205
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,880
I don't want a snickerdoodle, Ray.

206
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,360
What about this photo?

207
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,880
- Where was this one?
- Oh, yes.

208
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,360
That's Ava's 15th birthday party.

209
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,480
She had friends in for a sleepover.

210
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,960
They stayed up all night long
watching horror movies.

211
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,720
Sleepover, really?

212
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,560
I remember it well.

213
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:08,120
Well, I know for a fact Ava went
paintballing for her 15th birthday.

214
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,040
Pam meant her 16th birthday.

215
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,440
She always gets that part mixed up.

216
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,960
Always.

217
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,680
Who the hell are you guys?

218
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,080
Oh, god, I hate the sight of blood.

219
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,200
- Sara.
- Okay, okay fine!

220
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,880
We'll tell you everything,
just don't kill us.

221
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,800
- Why the hell shouldn't I?
- Because we're just actors.

222
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,320
What?

223
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,400
Yeah, yeah, okay.

224
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,560
Four years ago, we responded
to this online ad for a gig.

225
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,000
They gave us backstories
for our characters.

226
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,720
They told us if Ava
ever comes around to visit,

227
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,040
we just act like her parents.

228
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,240
- And who hired you?
- No, idea.

229
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,280
The money is automatically deposited.

230
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,200
Look, it... it's not such a bad gig,

231
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,280
considering Ava rarely
ever comes home to visit.

232
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,120
Why in the world would you agree
to be a part of such a charade?

233
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,560
Do you know how hard it is
to get an acting job in Fresno?

234
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,840
Right, well,
I apologize about the knife thing.

235
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,640
It is a gut reaction.

236
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,040
Nothing personal.

237
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,280
Sorry to bother you.
We'll be on our way now.

238
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,440
You have a lovely home, Mr. and Mrs.
whatever your real names are.

239
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,600
Okay, you said to wait
until after your second lunch.

240
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,320
This is your fourth.

241
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,000
Amaya wants me to teach you
how to use your totem,

242
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,000
so let's get cracking.

243
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,280
If I wanted to learn,
I would've gone to school.

244
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,640
You know, you are...

245
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,400
Okay.

246
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,360
Be patient, be kind,
abstain from negative thoughts.

247
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,920
Sorry, blood-sugar thing, fasting.

248
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,320
Fasting?

249
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,520
Yeah, I'm not eating.

250
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,800
Trying to lose some fat?

251
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,080
No, I love my body.

252
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,680
I'm trying to observe Ramadan.

253
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,240
So, observe it on a full stomach.

254
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,440
Is this bacon?

255
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,720
You Jewish?

256
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,080
I don't even know what... I can't.

257
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,400
What kind of person invents
a fake family and backstory?

258
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Well, when I was a kid,

259
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,960
I told my friends
my dad was an orthodontist.

260
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,880
It sounded much cooler than dentist.

261
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,480
If she was lying
about where she's from,

262
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,240
there's no telling what else she...

263
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,360
Sara, what are you doing here?

264
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,160
Gary was worried
that you were missing,

265
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,000
so naturally, we were concerned

266
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,400
and thought
we'd investigate it further.

267
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,560
Well, clearly
I'm no longer missing, so...

268
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,520
You sure you're okay?

269
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,600
I'm fine.

270
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,160
Don't I look fine?

271
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,240
Where have you been?

272
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,320
If you must know, I... Gary,
straighten your tie.

273
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,440
I was visiting my parents in Fresno.

274
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,640
Home-cooked meals and all.

275
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,560
Fresno?

276
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,000
Nothing like a tray
of snickerdoodles.

277
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,440
Well, I mean, any other kind
of cookie to, mend a broken heart.

278
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,840
You know, what,
I have a lot of work to do.

279
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,680
I'm sure you two can
see yourselves out.

280
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,120
You're okay?

281
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,080
No one likes running into their ex.

282
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,160
I'm fine.

283
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,360
And like I said,

284
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,440
let's find out what else
she's hiding from us.

285
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,920
So, this is Mari's Vixen Cave.

286
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Ever since my grandmother
lost her totem,

287
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,360
I figured I'd better start
keeping tabs on her.

288
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,440
It's a good thing I did.

289
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,200
I thought you hated Mari.

290
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,000
She's still my sister.

291
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,640
And even though I resented her
for inheriting the Anansi Totem,

292
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,480
I'd rather see it around
her neck than on Nora Darhk's.

293
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,320
So, let's get it back
to where it belongs.

294
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,840
You wanna help me?

295
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,000
We wanna help Amaya,
you wanna help your sister.

296
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,240
Either way, we have to get
that totem back.

297
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,120
The Darhks will kill me
if I turn on them.

298
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,160
Don't worry, this isn't
the first totem that we've lifted

299
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,280
from under their noses.

300
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,920
Soon we'll have five totems.

301
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,800
Do you really wanna
be one against five?

302
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,680
If we work together, we can defeat
the Darhks and Mallus.

303
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,080
And you get to protect your family.

304
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,720
Isn't that what you really want?

305
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,680
Fine.

306
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,080
But we do this my way.

307
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,400
Maybe Ava wasn't lying
about where she was,

308
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,960
but when she was.

309
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,360
I thought the worst thing
about her is she's from Fresno.

310
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,440
Well, I'm not...

311
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,520
I'm not seeing anything
in her Time Courier records

312
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,560
that wasn't Bureau-sanctioned
and by-the-book.

313
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,280
Wait, what's that?

314
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,680
Her first mission. Vancouver, 2213.

315
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,920
I can't access it.

316
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,840
The Bureau has sanctioned
2213 a no-fly zone.

317
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,920
Meaning?

318
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,600
Meaning, the Courier you stole
from Ava doesn't do you any good,

319
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,200
and the Waverider
can't fly there either.

320
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,760
The only person
who can override the restriction...

321
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,240
- Is a Time Bureau Director.
- Yeah.

322
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,080
But why wouldn't Director Sharpe...

323
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,640
Want us to know who she really is?

324
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,040
I'll give you one guess, Gary.

325
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,400
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.

326
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,640
You think my boss is an Anachronism?

327
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,200
The only way to know
for sure is to go to 2213.

328
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,360
So, how do we get there?

329
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,600
I...

330
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,480
I guess the only way would be
to hijack the mother ship,

331
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,560
but unfortunately
I failed flight training.

332
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,960
Damn astigmatism.

333
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,320
Like I'd let you fly.

334
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,800
Let's go.

335
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,120
What, what, what?

336
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,280
What do you mean,
the mother ship is on the move?

337
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,080
I mean, someone's
stealing it, ma'am.

338
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,160
Track it,
I'm going after it personally.

339
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,200
VANCOUVER, 2213

340
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,840
Should we really be doing this?

341
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,040
I mean, I'm... I'm sure
there's a good reason why no one

342
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,640
is supposed to come
to this time period.

343
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,280
Maybe Gary's right.

344
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,960
Maybe we should just ask Ava
what her connection is to this place.

345
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,080
Why, she's just gonna lie
to us again.

346
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,920
Well, if you wanna ask her,
now's your chance.

347
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,440
Director Sharpe.

348
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,160
Director Sharpe?

349
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,720
Just down across, and make a left.

350
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,160
Director Sharpes?

351
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,440
What kind of world is this?

352
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,680
Paradise?

353
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,600
I'm surrounded by my exes, Gary.

354
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,680
This is hell.

355
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,880
Pleasant day, citizens.

356
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,720
I had a dream like this once.

357
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,960
Yeah, me too,
but mine involved less clothing.

358
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,280
Mine too.

359
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,160
Okay.

360
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,400
Well, I guess this is why they
declared 2213 a no-fly zone.

361
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,960
Director Sharpe didn't want us
to find out

362
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,560
that she's secretly a robot.

363
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,920
I did not have sex with a robot.

364
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,200
No, you didn't, Sara,
you had sex with a clone.

365
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,800
<i>Here at Advanced Variant Automation,</i>

366
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,280
<i>we are working to bring
a brighter future.</i>

367
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,840
<i>Our cloning program
has produced the AVA.</i>

368
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,480
<i>AVA is the perfect woman
designed to keep us safe</i>

369
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,120
<i>and restore order to the chaos.</i>

370
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,440
It makes sense they'd clone Ava.

371
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,040
She is the perfect woman.

372
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,040
Oh, calm down, Gary, she's okay.

373
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,120
Before I have an Ava overload,

374
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,800
should we return to the comfort
and safety of the Time Bureau?

375
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,760
No.

376
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,920
AVA CORPORATION

377
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,680
We're not done here yet.

378
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:25,320
I think an ambush would
work best in this situation.

379
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,480
Sure.

380
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,560
If you wanna die a quick death.

381
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,520
Quite frankly, you two...

382
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,800
Are no match for the Darhks.

383
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,960
Okay.

384
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,800
- So, what's your plan?
- We lure them to us.

385
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,240
- With bait.
- No, no.

386
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,760
You are not using a totem.

387
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,840
No.

388
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,640
We have the next best thing.

389
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,200
- A legend.
- Wait, that's crazy.

390
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,760
Why don't we just go
to where they're at,

391
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,120
I'll swipe it like
I did the Fire Totem.

392
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,600
You overplayed your hand.

393
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,240
Now, they know you have whatever
you are on the team.

394
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,320
What I am is the fastest man alive.

395
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,000
- Thanks.
- Second fastest.

396
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,680
She didn't need to know that.

397
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,160
<i>Nathaniel?</i>

398
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,680
Amaya, hey.

399
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,880
How's Mari?

400
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,240
<i>The doctor says she's gonna be fine.</i>

401
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,400
She's strong, just like you.

402
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,240
<i>Thank you for checking in on her.</i>

403
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,720
So, when are you coming back?

404
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,520
We're gonna stick around for a while.

405
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,600
You know, talk her out of this
whole superhero business.

406
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,520
<i>Or at least until you
get your totem back,</i>

407
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,000
<i>and the timelines back in order.</i>

408
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,880
In that case, just take care
of yourself, okay?

409
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,760
I love you, Nathaniel.

410
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,080
Yeah, me too.

411
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,400
Shouldn't we be bringing
Amaya into this?

412
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,480
- No.
- No.

413
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,840
We already have one Vixen
in the hospital as it is.

414
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,920
Agreed.

415
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,280
My grandmother will want to play
the hero and get herself killed.

416
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,400
If that happens, Mari and I
will be wiped from existence.

417
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,880
Right, so we're gonna need you
to keep her out of our hair.

418
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,280
- But I...
- I know, I know. I'll be fine.

419
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,400
I just need you
to keep an eye on Amaya.

420
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,040
Damn it, Wally.

421
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,000
AVA CORPORATION

422
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,360
This place is creepy.

423
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,360
How about I wait outside?

424
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,440
How about you calm down?

425
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:24,000
Is it too late to mention my fear
of things covered in sheets?

426
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,240
Hey, guys, over here.

427
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,560
How is this even possible?

428
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,280
Looks like they created Ava
from what they believe...

429
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,480
are the best genes from around
the world to make the perfect woman.

430
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,360
Though, she's a little pale,
if you ask me.

431
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,880
I should've known
she was too good to be true.

432
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,840
That doesn't mean that
what you guys had wasn't real.

433
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,400
That is exactly what it means.

434
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,520
Guys.

435
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,440
Everything that she's told me
about herself has been a lie.

436
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,120
- Guys.
- What, Gary?

437
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,840
Oh, crumbs, I think I woke one up.

438
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,080
You are in violation of bylaw 575.

439
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,200
You do not have clearance
to be in this room.

440
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,080
We were just leaving.

441
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,240
Just let us go, it'll be fine.

442
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,680
If I let you go,
I have to let everyone go.

443
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,120
You must be terminated.

444
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,880
I think she wants to kill us.

445
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,320
You don't say.

446
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,000
Should we help?

447
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,640
Not unless you want
both of them to kill you.

448
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,200
All right, tie her up,
before she comes to.

449
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,480
This is weird.

450
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,800
These chains won't be nearly
as convincing

451
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,360
if you can turn to steel.

452
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,600
You know, I'm a good actor,
I could've sold it.

453
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,800
And what's with these vigilantes
and their dark spaces?

454
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,520
It's like they're afraid
of that healthy bronze look.

455
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,960
Oh, I... I... I didn't mean you.

456
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,480
I... I... you look great,
honey, you...

457
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,000
I underestimated you, Kuasa.

458
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,400
You brought us a valuable
bargaining chip.

459
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,000
I want something in exchange.

460
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,880
My grandmother's totem.

461
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,440
It belongs to me.

462
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,720
You didn't actually think she was
gonna hand that over to you,

463
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,800
did you?

464
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,440
- She's right.
- You what?

465
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,800
The power of Mallus flows through me.

466
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,680
I don't need some trinket.

467
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,480
Besides...

468
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,120
Kuasa has proven herself
a loyal acolyte.

469
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,240
The plan worked, free me.

470
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,000
I once thought that losing this totem

471
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,720
was the greatest threat
to me and my family.

472
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,840
But you are in love with my Nana Baa.

473
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,240
And should she choose
to love you in return,

474
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,080
me and my sister
will never even exist.

475
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,200
This is not the plan.

476
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,400
Plans change.

477
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,320
This is better than
"The Brave and the Bold."

478
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,800
For a PhD,
you're remarkably gullible.

479
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,840
Oh, Kuasa, you're better than this.

480
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,720
Be the woman your grandmother
believes you to be.

481
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,840
I'm being the woman
she knows me to be.

482
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,720
When you kill him, do it slowly.

483
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,040
Is that too tight?

484
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,160
I can never tell.

485
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,240
Not that I have experience
tying people up,

486
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,440
- because I... I don't...
- Stop talking to it, Gary.

487
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,600
Sara, she isn't an it.

488
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,360
She's a real person.

489
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,440
They all are.

490
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,640
Our Ava is just an anachronism

491
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,680
somehow displaced
200 years in the past,

492
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,920
AKA our present.

493
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,480
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- I know, I... I mean, I get it.

494
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,000
Why would she tell me
she comes from a place

495
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,680
where's she's just one
of a million copies?

496
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,760
There you are.

497
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,440
Oh, god, another one?

498
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,280
Gary, that's our Ava.

499
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,600
What does he mean "another one"?

500
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,440
Don't mind Gary.

501
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,440
You know, it's interesting,
I would've found you sooner,

502
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,000
except I seem to have misplaced
my Time Courier.

503
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,680
What are you three doing in 2213?

504
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,520
We are investigating an anachronism.

505
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,000
An anachronism, really?

506
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,200
What is this place, anyway?

507
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,800
Oh, come on, Ava.

508
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,440
The jig's up, we know.

509
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,080
What are you talking about?

510
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,480
Oh, my God.

511
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Well, maybe she's not
a card-carrying member

512
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,240
of the clone club after all.

513
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,640
I must prepare
for the Master's arrival.

514
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,360
I trust you'll be able
to make him talk?

515
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,400
No, problem, Nora doll.

516
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,480
Talk? You don't have
to torture me to talk.

517
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,480
The trick is you gotta get me
to shut up.

518
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,240
It's not much of a trick.

519
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:08,000
You will have the legends bring
the missing totems to me.

520
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,840
Or you will die.

521
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:18,680
Your daughter, she looks,
she looks, she looks different.

522
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,760
No, offense.

523
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,840
None taken.

524
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,200
Her face...

525
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,200
How long has that been a situation?

526
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,360
You know, what, since you're
gonna die, I might as well tell you.

527
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:36,360
The... the closer that Mallus gets
to escaping his prison,

528
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,920
the worse the situation gets.

529
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,640
It... don't. Stop looking,
don't look at me.

530
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,160
I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna...

531
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,480
I'm sorry, it... it's not you,
it... it's me.

532
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,200
Torture just doesn't bring me
the same joy anymore.

533
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,480
It's okay,
you're distracted, I get it.

534
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,080
You made a deal with the devil,

535
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,160
now he's come back to claim
your little girl, am I right?

536
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,480
- Yes! I mean, I...
- Yeah.

537
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,080
I wanted to burn the world down
and rebuild it in my image,

538
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,680
not lose the person
I was doing it for.

539
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,520
Damien, this is deep stuff, man.

540
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,280
Let's just keep digging,
let's keep digging.

541
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,040
- Just do me one favor.
- Yes, what?

542
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,680
Can you lose the cattle prod?

543
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,800
I mean, I'm gonna die anyways.

544
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,760
Let's just make this a safe space.

545
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,880
- Safe space.
- Safe space.

546
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,720
Director Sharpe?

547
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,960
Director Sharpe.

548
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,040
Are you okay?

549
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,800
Oh, Gary, God, get out of my face.

550
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,200
I'll take that as a yes.

551
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,000
What do you remember
before you hit your head?

552
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,880
I... I... I came to 2213 to,
to find the mother ship,

553
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,560
and I... I stepped out of the portal,

554
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,360
and then you were breathing
in my face.

555
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,960
Is there something I'm forgetting?

556
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,680
Well...

557
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,480
before your little mishap,

558
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,400
you were commending us
on our great work

559
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,480
and you even mentioned something

560
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,840
- about a promotion.
- This is terrible.

561
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,680
Okay, can we just tell her the truth?

562
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,280
That, what, she was hatched
in a government lab?

563
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,160
God, this whole time I thought
that she was hiding who she was,

564
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:58,480
but clearly she had no idea
she was a clone.

565
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,400
I mean, did you see
the way she reacted?

566
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,360
What was that?

567
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,960
No, do, don't.

568
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,400
- What is...
- Don't.

569
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,560
Don't what?

570
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,960
- Thank god, she's gone.
- Who's gone?

571
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,480
We gotta get out of here
before that fembot sounds the alarm.

572
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,880
"Fembot"?

573
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,440
Come on.

574
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,840
Okay, now concentrate on the target.

575
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,480
It's about focus and precision.

576
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,960
Like I need help
lighting things on fire.

577
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,800
Okay.

578
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,520
One.

579
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,960
Two.

580
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,560
Rory, could you focus on something
other than your stomach for a second?

581
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,680
Whatever.

582
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,640
- Yeah.
- I said just the target, you idiot.

583
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,600
- I'm the idiot?
- Yeah.

584
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,960
You're the one who doesn't
eat when you're hungry.

585
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,080
Maybe if you did,
you wouldn't be such a bitch.

586
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,360
What did you just say?

587
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,800
You heard me.

588
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,680
What is going on?

589
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,200
Zari's training Rory.

590
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,720
Or killing him.

591
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,880
But now that you're back on the ship,

592
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,600
we need to get out of Detroit
and back to work.

593
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,800
Nate is actually still trying
to convince Mari

594
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,560
not to be a vigilante,
and she is stubborn.

595
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,520
I wonder where she gets that from.

596
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,200
Kuasa, what're you doing here?

597
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,800
I come with a peace offering.

598
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,000
How did you get that?

599
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,920
Wait, where is Nate?

600
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,200
I gave him to the Darhks
in exchange for the totem.

601
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,240
- That wasn't the plan.
- What plan?

602
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,680
Nate thought it'd be
better not to tell you.

603
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,440
Because you're in love with him,
Nana Baa.

604
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,200
And that love is a threat
to both Mari and me.

605
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,280
So, you betrayed him?

606
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,720
He's not my grandfather.

607
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,640
Every moment that you spend with him

608
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,680
is a threat
to our entire family's future.

609
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,520
How can you be so selfish?

610
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,680
You're the selfish one.

611
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,880
Our family's destruction
looms in 1992.

612
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,920
You promised you'd save us.

613
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,800
And yet you continuously
search for ways

614
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,280
to abandon your family and Zambesi.

615
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,480
I have done everything in my power
to try and redeem you.

616
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,640
And in doing so, Mari got hurt.

617
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,360
She understands that being
a totem bearer means

618
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,720
protecting all people,
not just our own.

619
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,440
It's no wonder this totem ended up
with Mari and not you.

620
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,680
You're beyond redemption.

621
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,240
Mother ship is this way.

622
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,640
Sara, listen, I really need
to confess something to you.

623
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,320
- Can we do this later?
- No, I... listen.

624
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,000
I... I wasn't really visiting
my parents in Fresno.

625
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,120
I don't even know why I said that.

626
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,200
I never visit my parents.

627
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,840
- They're like strangers to me.
- You don't say.

628
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,560
But when we broke up,
I actually called my ex in Vegas.

629
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,040
I'm so ashamed, but it's
worse than that, all right?

630
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,120
I created an UpSwipz profile.

631
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,040
And I actually went really
overboard on the swiping.

632
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,720
It... it really is more
intuitive to go up and down,

633
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,880
but that's not even the point.

634
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,000
The point is I realize
that it's not for me.

635
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,120
Okay, and...

636
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,280
Look, I know that we aren't
together anymore, Sara,

637
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,640
but I really just felt like
I needed to be honest with you.

638
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,720
Okay?

639
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,320
Great, now you all hate me.

640
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,240
Not that I can blame you. I just...

641
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,000
Can you please stop
looking at me like that?

642
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,080
I can't take it.

643
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,280
Ava.

644
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,800
Look, it's not you, it...

645
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,120
It's them.

646
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,560
What the hell are those things,
and why do they all look like me?

647
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,080
Okay.

648
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,320
Well, short version, you're a clone.

649
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,920
I'm a...

650
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,800
I'm a clone?

651
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,120
From the future?

652
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,080
What're you...
I'm a future clone thing?

653
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,160
Ava, Ava.

654
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,800
It's okay, Director Sharpe.

655
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,160
Gary will take care of everything.

656
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,240
No.

657
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,720
She deserves to know.

658
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,360
I don't understand,
this can't be happening.

659
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,920
You're saying I'm one of them?

660
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,360
Hey, look, this might be
where you're from,

661
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,920
but it is not who you are.

662
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,840
Then who the hell am I?

663
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,800
You are the same person
that you have always been.

664
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,960
You are the woman who has
worked her way to the top

665
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,200
to becoming the head
of the Time Bureau.

666
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,760
- You are extraordinary.
- No.

667
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,400
My... my life,

668
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,920
my memories,
they're all manufactured.

669
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,600
They're... they're not real,
I'm not even real.

670
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,240
Ava, you are real.

671
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,440
You are as real as I feel about you.

672
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,720
How can you even say
that when I'm... I'm just

673
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,040
like one of those things?

674
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,360
Because I know you.

675
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,200
And I know that you are a badass.

676
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,520
And you are different.

677
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,960
And now that we both know that,

678
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,080
I need you to act exactly
like one of those clones

679
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,400
if we wanna get out of here.

680
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,800
Go ahead, Darhk.

681
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,200
Make my day.

682
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,360
You asked for it, steel boy.

683
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,240
- Was that good?
- Really good, really good.

684
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,360
Just a little bit bigger this time.

685
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,040
- Okay.
- Okay, you ready?

686
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,840
Oh, no, why, God?

687
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,560
There's blood everywhere.

688
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,520
There's so much blood.

689
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,160
You know, better
than to play Mallus for a fool.

690
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,320
No, no, no, honey, I can explain.

691
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,320
Such a waste of a good head of hair.

692
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,320
Hey, get your hands off
that hard body.

693
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,680
I'm sorry, that sounded
way better in my head.

694
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,200
What the hell?

695
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:02,440
Seems that you and Kuasa have
resolved your family squabble.

696
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,560
So much drama over a silly trinket.

697
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,720
Pathetic.

698
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:11,800
I wouldn't expect you to understand
anything about honor or legacy.

699
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,360
Amaya!

700
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,240
I've apprehended the intruders.

701
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,720
I'll escort them from the premises
and terminate them.

702
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,920
Move.

703
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,640
Don't move.

704
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,080
This one's a fake,
she's not one of us.

705
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,880
Step forward.

706
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,760
You are to be
reprocessed immediately.

707
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,280
That feel fake to you?

708
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,080
Stay close, I don't wanna
lose you in this crowd.

709
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,520
Is this as weird
for you as it is for me?

710
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,880
I've had messier breakups.

711
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,920
Okay.

712
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,320
I'm so sorry, I'm sorry, I...

713
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,520
This is the second worst
attack of the clones I've seen.

714
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,360
Please, please,
I don't wanna do this.

715
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,560
Gary.

716
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:30,080
Thank God, it's the real you.

717
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,640
Let's get back to the ship
before more show up.

718
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,720
Yeah.

719
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,360
You were right, Sara.

720
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,160
I'm never gonna be a mindless clone.

721
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,720
I'm keeping the suit.

722
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,720
Your totem is still governed
by my powers.

723
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,480
No.

724
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,560
No.

725
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,640
What're you doing here?

726
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,840
I'm not here for you.

727
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,920
Now, get your ass up.

728
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,320
Nathaniel.

729
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,000
Love you too.

730
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,120
Hardly seems like a fair fight.

731
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,800
Then I'd give up now.

732
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,640
I was talking about all of you.

733
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,320
If you cannot defeat me
in this vessel,

734
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:53,560
how will you stop me
once I've assumed my true form?

735
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,160
She's too strong, we have to leave.

736
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,800
I gave you life, Kuasa.

737
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,640
Offered you real power.

738
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,000
Family is true power.

739
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,480
I know you're
in there somewhere, Nora.

740
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,800
You have your father,
I have my grandmother.

741
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,680
We don't have
to become our demons.

742
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,680
I like my demons.

743
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,320
Nana Baa.

744
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,600
Kuasa.

745
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,600
No.

746
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,480
She should've known.

747
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,160
There's no running from Mallus.

748
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,160
- Amaya, we gotta get out of here.
- No.

749
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,800
- Amaya, we gotta go.
- No.

750
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,800
I'll do what you want.

751
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,520
Just... just put me down.

752
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,720
Thanks.

753
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,200
No, it wasn't me, it was our totems.

754
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,600
Something's wrong.

755
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,000
It's Kuasa.

756
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,760
She's dead.

757
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,920
Yeah.

758
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,760
I need a drink.

759
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:40,120
Gary, you cannot tell anyone
about what you saw in 2213.

760
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,880
If you do,
I will straight up kill you.

761
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,560
But I'm terrible at keeping secrets.

762
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,840
And every time I close my eyes,
all I see is you.

763
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,120
I'll never get it out of my head.

764
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,240
I wouldn't worry about it, Gary.

765
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,680
Gary, right this way,
I got a flasher with your name on it.

766
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,440
If I had known
that was gonna happen...

767
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,680
It's not your fault.

768
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,080
Still, I shouldn't have
gone behind your back.

769
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,080
And I shouldn't have tried
to outsmart the Darhks on my own.

770
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,160
You wanted me to have my totem back.

771
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,080
And now I do.

772
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,520
Come on, Amaya, just say it.

773
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,440
I got Kuasa killed.

774
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,880
I got my granddaughter killed.

775
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,400
You?

776
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,640
How?

777
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,040
By goading her to be more
like her sister.

778
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,400
Kuasa wanted to prove
that she was worthy of this.

779
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,840
She died proving
that I was wrong about her,

780
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:44,240
by saving the life of a man
who threatened her existence.

781
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,120
Exactly,
and if I didn't get captured,

782
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,760
- then Kuasa...
- Was doomed either way.

783
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,760
I mean, that's how time works.

784
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:54,000
Well, clearly,
time wants my family to suffer.

785
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:57,520
Amaya, you have to believe
you're in charge of your own destiny.

786
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,800
You know, there are times that I wish
I'd never set foot on this ship.

787
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,880
If I'd never left 1942...

788
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,560
I would've returned to Zambesi
like I was supposed to,

789
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:14,320
with no idea of the tragedy
that awaited me.

790
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,160
I would've died an old woman.

791
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,040
Murdered by warlords.

792
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,200
And you and I never would've met.

793
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,760
And...

794
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,400
Is that what you want, Amaya?

795
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,520
I don't know, Nathaniel.

796
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,760
Thought you couldn't eat.

797
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,920
Yeah, I told Gideon to tell me
when sundown

798
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,560
would've been if I'd been at home.

799
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,520
But I mean, Ramadan is just a stupid

800
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,560
1400-year-old
tradition to you, right?

801
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,160
So, why am I even talking about it?

802
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:04,760
Well, how about if I help you
heat it up?

803
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,960
Try it, it's good for you.

804
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,560
You know,
I can't stop thinking about Kuasa.

805
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,320
I felt her die.

806
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,560
Me too.

807
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:27,200
Mind you, she did try
to kill us a couple of times.

808
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,320
But she was a totem bearer,
and Amaya's granddaughter.

809
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,760
And the totems supposedly
connect us to something larger.

810
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,400
Yeah, for better or worse.

811
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,160
You know, I think that's
kind of why I still fast.

812
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,320
When I was little, my mom
tried to get me to do it.

813
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:46,000
And I wouldn't, but she did
make me learn how to cook iftar.

814
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:49,720
It's the meal
we eat to break the fast.

815
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,280
And while she cooked,
she would say that Ramadan's

816
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,760
not just a time for honoring God,

817
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:56,680
but a time to honor tradition
and family.

818
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,680
Community.

819
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:03,920
So, whenever I fast
or cook iftar it...

820
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,400
It makes me feel connected to my mom.

821
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,840
I'm hungry.

822
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,080
Still pork.

823
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,240
Still good.

824
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,600
You all right?

825
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,800
You know, maybe you should
wipe my memory too.

826
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,400
How am I supposed to face
the Time Bureau now,

827
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,800
knowing what I know about myself?

828
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,520
The same way that I face my team.

829
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,400
We don't have the luxury
of running away and hiding.

830
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,200
Not with the fight
we have ahead of us.

831
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,000
Our team's gonna need us
to lead them through this.

832
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,640
You know, there just there
must be some reason

833
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,040
that I don't remember
anything about 2213.

834
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,920
Anything about being a clone.

835
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,960
I'm sure there is.

836
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,000
Who recruited you for the Bureau?

837
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,520
Rip.

838
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,120
Well, I bet you that entire bottle

839
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,480
he's the one who wiped your file
from the Bureau

840
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,040
and put 2213 off limits.

841
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,920
Why would he do that to me?

842
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,080
I don't know.

843
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,080
But we're gonna find out.

844
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:16,320
Gideon, initialize the time drive
and set a course.

845
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,240
<i>Traveling to this time period
is inadvisable.</i>

846
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,120
<i>I'm sure Captain Lance
would not allow it.</i>

847
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,320
Please, Gideon.

848
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,520
I have to save my granddaughter.

849
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,440
I have to save my family.

850
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,120
And no one is going to stop me.

851
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,960
Now, lock in the coordinates.

852
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:34,960
<i>Course set for the M'Changa
province of Zambesi, 1992.</i>
