1
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:33,052
Good morning, sir!

2
00:01:52,405 --> 00:01:54,198
Dicky Chow!

3
00:01:56,242 --> 00:01:59,078
Just look at yourself. You're covered in dirt.

4
00:01:59,245 --> 00:02:01,456
- I just...
- Don't move!

5
00:02:02,123 --> 00:02:04,208
And don't give me the usual routine.

6
00:02:05,043 --> 00:02:07,128
Why are you always so untidy?

7
00:02:07,378 --> 00:02:08,880
What's the matter, Mr. Cao?

8
00:02:09,047 --> 00:02:10,048
Explain yourself!

9
00:02:10,298 --> 00:02:12,300
Let me talk to him.

10
00:02:15,303 --> 00:02:18,306
Where did the dirt come from, Dicky?

11
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:21,642
Well, on my way to school, I slipped and fell over.

12
00:02:22,143 --> 00:02:24,729
Don't your mom or dad bring you to school?

13
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:27,982
Mom died a long time ago and Dad's very busy.

14
00:02:28,733 --> 00:02:30,485
What does your dad do?

15
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:31,986
He's a coolie.

16
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:43,164
I'd like to meet him one day. Would that be possible?

17
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:45,666
I don't think he has the time.

18
00:02:46,751 --> 00:02:50,254
When he's available, then. Will you let me know?

19
00:02:50,421 --> 00:02:52,507
Go clean up before class starts.

20
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,509
Thanks, Miss Yuen.

21
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,350
I want to be a superstar.

22
00:03:02,517 --> 00:03:05,144
- Like who?
- Nicole Kidman.

23
00:03:05,353 --> 00:03:08,523
She gets $20 million for a movie.

24
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,775
I wouldn't mind being her either.

25
00:03:11,526 --> 00:03:13,319
I want to be an entrepreneur.

26
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:14,862
What kind of business?

27
00:03:15,029 --> 00:03:18,366
Any kind, as long as it's really big.

28
00:03:18,533 --> 00:03:20,827
Big business always pays out.

29
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,204
Why not?

30
00:03:31,337 --> 00:03:33,464
I want to be a poor person.

31
00:03:38,511 --> 00:03:39,720
Stop!

32
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:44,392
My dad says if you have integrity...

33
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:47,728
don't lie, don't fight, and study really hard...

34
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:51,065
then people will respect you even if you're poor.

35
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:08,583
Don't...

36
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:12,837
Don't come over here!

37
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:16,340
Put it down!

38
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,928
Go back to your seat!

39
00:05:45,513 --> 00:05:50,851
The name of this amazing dog is CJ1.

40
00:05:51,269 --> 00:05:56,023
It was developed jointly by U.S.,
French and German scientists.

41
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,776
Imagine! Jointly developed!

42
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:01,654
- Do you want a go?
- Yes, please.

43
00:06:01,821 --> 00:06:03,698
Back off, loser!

44
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:08,327
There are only two in the world.

45
00:06:08,494 --> 00:06:12,707
The U.S. president's daughter has the other one.

46
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,793
- What are you doing?
- Eating noodles.

47
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,462
Stand up!

48
00:06:18,963 --> 00:06:23,801
No matter how much you eat, you are doomed to be a dwarf.

49
00:06:23,968 --> 00:06:25,636
Now get lost!

50
00:06:25,803 --> 00:06:30,516
The quality of the students
in this place gets worse every day.

51
00:06:30,683 --> 00:06:34,895
What have we here, another alien?

52
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,898
- What are you doing?
- Eating rice.

53
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:41,235
You're just like a huge tub of lard.

54
00:06:41,402 --> 00:06:43,738
Maybe you should go see the doctor.

55
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:47,533
You eat so much. It's horrible!

56
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:52,079
Someone call the police to shoot this monster!

57
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:55,082
Eat to death! Giant monster!

58
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:56,334
What are you doing?

59
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:07,470
Bullies! Heroes don't hit women.

60
00:07:07,637 --> 00:07:10,125
Not you again!

61
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:11,710
Ignore him.

62
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:16,006
Go away, poor boy. We don't want you around.

63
00:07:16,381 --> 00:07:18,383
Go away, poor boy.

64
00:07:34,024 --> 00:07:35,358
Hi.

65
00:07:35,525 --> 00:07:36,860
Hi.

66
00:07:39,487 --> 00:07:41,031
You've been sent off the field too?

67
00:07:41,364 --> 00:07:43,116
Yes.

68
00:07:44,784 --> 00:07:46,828
Did you forget your sneakers?

69
00:07:47,203 --> 00:07:50,623
I brought them, but I didn't wear them on purpose.

70
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,042
Why?

71
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:54,169
Because I wanted to be with you.

72
00:08:03,219 --> 00:08:05,638
Are all your shoes like that?

73
00:08:05,847 --> 00:08:10,643
Yes, they are. My dad gets them from the dump.

74
00:08:10,852 --> 00:08:12,812
Your dad's so nice.

75
00:08:12,979 --> 00:08:14,397
He is, actually.

76
00:08:15,398 --> 00:08:18,902
But I so much want a new pair...

77
00:08:19,069 --> 00:08:21,237
because I really love sports.

78
00:08:22,238 --> 00:08:24,616
I'd like you to keep the old ones.

79
00:08:24,783 --> 00:08:26,034
Why?

80
00:08:26,534 --> 00:08:29,370
Then we'd be punished together, forever.

81
00:08:49,599 --> 00:08:51,059
Get that panel up there.

82
00:08:51,267 --> 00:08:52,393
Quickly!

83
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,271
You. Hurry up.

84
00:09:08,409 --> 00:09:11,412
You're no longer needed. Go home.

85
00:09:12,038 --> 00:09:13,414
Hey, boss?

86
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:18,128
With it being so hot right now, my son can't sleep.

87
00:09:18,294 --> 00:09:20,088
I need to buy an electric fan.

88
00:09:20,255 --> 00:09:21,589
Can't you keep me on?

89
00:09:21,756 --> 00:09:24,801
You should be paying me back instead.

90
00:09:24,968 --> 00:09:28,680
I paid all the bills when your wife got sick and died.

91
00:09:28,847 --> 00:09:31,516
Look at yourself.
You'll die before your debts are repaid.

92
00:09:31,683 --> 00:09:34,686
You're starving yourself so your son
can go to that fancy school.

93
00:09:34,853 --> 00:09:38,481
If my son can go to public school, why can't yours?

94
00:09:38,648 --> 00:09:41,651
Well, I want him to have opportunities.

95
00:09:41,818 --> 00:09:43,653
I don't want him to end up like me.

96
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,989
But you have to have capability.

97
00:09:46,156 --> 00:09:47,532
He's highly capable.

98
00:09:47,699 --> 00:09:49,159
I'm talking about you, not him.

99
00:09:49,993 --> 00:09:52,996
All you have is a casual job with no prospects.

100
00:09:53,163 --> 00:09:54,497
How are you going to cope?

101
00:09:55,123 --> 00:09:57,167
- I can manage.
- You can't manage!

102
00:09:57,625 --> 00:10:00,461
- I can.
- You can't!

103
00:10:02,172 --> 00:10:03,882
I can manage.

104
00:10:06,217 --> 00:10:07,552
Very well. Block B. Foundations.

105
00:10:07,969 --> 00:10:09,179
Thanks.

106
00:10:09,512 --> 00:10:12,515
If you want to die, I can't stop you. Shame on you.

107
00:11:07,028 --> 00:11:08,112
You're back.

108
00:11:08,529 --> 00:11:10,073
Can we have dinner? I'm starving.

109
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,532
Just step back a bit.

110
00:11:15,954 --> 00:11:18,039
- What's going on?
- Turn round.

111
00:11:29,133 --> 00:11:30,593
Come here.

112
00:11:31,219 --> 00:11:32,762
What?

113
00:11:32,929 --> 00:11:34,889
An electric fan!

114
00:11:35,056 --> 00:11:37,475
That's so great! Is it real?

115
00:11:37,642 --> 00:11:39,394
We finally have a fan!

116
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,438
- Now sit down and let me turn it.
- Quickly, Dad!

117
00:11:48,611 --> 00:11:51,322
Dad, did you find this in the garbage?

118
00:11:51,489 --> 00:11:53,241
No, I bought it.

119
00:11:53,825 --> 00:11:55,285
It cost a lot of money.

120
00:11:55,451 --> 00:11:56,786
You were ripped off!

121
00:11:56,953 --> 00:11:59,914
No, it was fine when I bought it.

122
00:12:00,081 --> 00:12:02,458
So how come it's not working now?

123
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:05,837
Dumbass. Use your head next time.

124
00:12:06,004 --> 00:12:08,006
"Dumbass"? Where did you get that from?

125
00:12:08,172 --> 00:12:09,465
A guy in my class.

126
00:12:09,632 --> 00:12:11,592
Oh, really? Well, let me tell you...

127
00:12:11,801 --> 00:12:14,262
we may be poor, but we don't use bad language.

128
00:12:14,429 --> 00:12:17,181
We don't steal. We don't rob.

129
00:12:17,348 --> 00:12:20,643
We don't take things that don't belong to us.

130
00:12:20,852 --> 00:12:24,689
You must concentrate on your studies.

131
00:12:26,149 --> 00:12:31,195
I didn't study at all when I was young
and look where it's gotten me.

132
00:12:57,013 --> 00:12:58,348
We're having an apple today?

133
00:12:58,514 --> 00:12:59,724
Yes, we are.

134
00:13:01,017 --> 00:13:02,352
But put it down now.

135
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,022
Finish your dinner first.

136
00:13:07,482 --> 00:13:09,817
Hey, Dad, my sneakers are worn out again.

137
00:13:09,984 --> 00:13:11,235
Will you buy me some more?

138
00:13:11,402 --> 00:13:14,530
I need you to get me a better pair,
or I'll be sent off the field again.

139
00:13:15,031 --> 00:13:17,533
Got it. Don't worry.

140
00:13:22,497 --> 00:13:26,751
You're still eating! Lay off the cockroach.

141
00:13:27,543 --> 00:13:29,545
You can get it after you've finished.

142
00:14:05,915 --> 00:14:08,751
Nice. You've improved.

143
00:14:13,923 --> 00:14:15,842
Not bad.

144
00:14:50,168 --> 00:14:54,297
<i>There have been many sightings lately
of UFOs, Unidentified Flying Objects.</i>

145
00:14:55,173 --> 00:14:56,507
What happened to the cartoons?

146
00:14:56,674 --> 00:14:58,968
They'll be back in a minute.

147
00:15:00,178 --> 00:15:02,638
<i>Could you please tell us what happened?</i>

148
00:15:02,805 --> 00:15:04,348
<i>I saw a flying object.</i>

149
00:15:04,515 --> 00:15:07,643
<i>It flew from here to there with a "whew" sound.</i>

150
00:15:10,146 --> 00:15:11,689
<i>Can you describe the object in more detail?</i>

151
00:15:11,856 --> 00:15:13,608
<i>That object could really fly!</i>

152
00:15:13,774 --> 00:15:15,651
<i>Though it wobbled a bit.</i>

153
00:15:15,818 --> 00:15:17,278
<i>I suspect it had crashed before.</i>

154
00:15:17,445 --> 00:15:18,446
<i>Crashed?</i>

155
00:15:18,613 --> 00:15:21,324
<i>Yes, like a car crash. It might have been broken.</i>

156
00:15:21,491 --> 00:15:23,367
<i>I took a picture of it.</i>

157
00:15:31,209 --> 00:15:33,294
<i>What kind of camera did you use?</i>

158
00:15:33,461 --> 00:15:37,381
<i>It was expensive, but I can't possibly tell you the make.</i>

159
00:15:38,174 --> 00:15:40,054
<i>Did this particular flying object make a sound?</i>

160
00:15:40,218 --> 00:15:44,138
<i>It made some "whew" sounds like I just
told you. "Whew." Do you hear me?</i>

161
00:15:45,181 --> 00:15:47,183
Unbelievable.

162
00:16:08,204 --> 00:16:09,747
Don't run off like that.

163
00:16:09,914 --> 00:16:12,917
Dad, this is called a CJ1.

164
00:16:13,417 --> 00:16:15,419
Everyone at school has one. They're great!

165
00:16:15,586 --> 00:16:16,587
Really?

166
00:16:18,422 --> 00:16:19,924
Let's go home. Put it back.

167
00:16:32,853 --> 00:16:34,397
What's the matter?

168
00:16:34,897 --> 00:16:36,524
Why can't I have it?

169
00:16:36,691 --> 00:16:38,776
We'll buy it after I get paid next month.

170
00:16:38,943 --> 00:16:40,111
Now, put it down.

171
00:16:48,452 --> 00:16:50,246
Let go!

172
00:16:54,584 --> 00:16:57,920
Didn't you hear me? I have no money.

173
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:04,093
If you buy me this,
I'll never ask for anything ever again.

174
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,761
I beg you.

175
00:17:07,722 --> 00:17:10,808
What about this one? What features does it have?

176
00:17:13,102 --> 00:17:14,770
Let go.

177
00:17:17,106 --> 00:17:18,774
Let go!

178
00:17:23,404 --> 00:17:24,989
Let go!

179
00:17:28,451 --> 00:17:29,827
Let go!

180
00:17:31,662 --> 00:17:32,788
Come back!

181
00:17:34,165 --> 00:17:36,792
Sir? Do you wish to buy that?

182
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:54,352
Come on, Dicky. Don't cry.

183
00:17:54,518 --> 00:17:56,479
Stop crying now.

184
00:17:56,646 --> 00:17:58,147
Good boy, stop crying.

185
00:17:58,314 --> 00:17:59,523
Dicky.

186
00:18:00,441 --> 00:18:01,692
Are you Mr. Chow?

187
00:18:01,859 --> 00:18:04,528
I'm Miss Yuen, Dicky's teacher. Good to meet you.

188
00:18:04,695 --> 00:18:07,156
Miss Yuen. Good to meet you too.

189
00:18:07,365 --> 00:18:09,825
Is Dicky well-behaved at school?

190
00:18:09,992 --> 00:18:12,119
Yes, he's quite good.

191
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,330
He's in a really bad mood right now.

192
00:18:14,497 --> 00:18:17,124
I know. Kids just want every toy they see.

193
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:18,292
True.

194
00:18:18,459 --> 00:18:22,338
Just happens I didn't bring any money today, so...

195
00:18:23,506 --> 00:18:24,799
Dicky, go to your dad.

196
00:18:25,174 --> 00:18:26,342
Come here.

197
00:18:28,052 --> 00:18:30,554
- I'm sorry, Mr. Chow.
- Don't worry. He's like that.

198
00:18:30,971 --> 00:18:33,641
In fact, I'd like to do a home visit.

199
00:18:33,808 --> 00:18:36,686
He did tell me, but I'm very busy at work...

200
00:18:36,852 --> 00:18:40,064
I believe that a good education
doesn't just rely on the teacher.

201
00:18:40,231 --> 00:18:42,566
That's why I'd like to involve you.

202
00:18:42,733 --> 00:18:44,360
It'll be good for him.

203
00:18:44,652 --> 00:18:46,362
Ah, yes. I see.

204
00:18:46,821 --> 00:18:48,739
Dicky, I need to go now.

205
00:18:50,491 --> 00:18:53,911
Don't be so grumpy. And listen to your dad, okay?

206
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,330
Okay?

207
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:00,251
- I must go.
- Okay.

208
00:19:00,418 --> 00:19:02,044
- Bye, now.
- Bye, now.

209
00:21:38,158 --> 00:21:39,368
Dicky.

210
00:21:39,535 --> 00:21:41,078
Look at me.

211
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:46,917
I have something way better than CJ1.

212
00:21:47,084 --> 00:21:48,544
Do you want to see it?

213
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,554
Are you sure?

214
00:22:00,055 --> 00:22:04,560
In that case, I'll throw it away and get back to work.

215
00:22:49,104 --> 00:22:50,272
Goodbye, sir.

216
00:22:50,439 --> 00:22:51,565
Goodbye.

217
00:22:53,567 --> 00:22:54,818
Fanny.

218
00:22:54,985 --> 00:22:58,614
Where's this amazing toy, then?

219
00:22:58,781 --> 00:23:00,115
Look!

220
00:23:05,496 --> 00:23:07,498
What's so great about that?

221
00:23:07,665 --> 00:23:09,959
It's fun. Look!

222
00:23:11,001 --> 00:23:14,296
It doesn't look that fun to me.

223
00:23:14,505 --> 00:23:15,631
What do you think?

224
00:23:16,131 --> 00:23:18,676
Actually, I agree. It's no fun.

225
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:23,180
Never mind. See you tomorrow.

226
00:23:26,809 --> 00:23:29,019
What's that thing you're holding?

227
00:23:29,186 --> 00:23:30,604
Nothing.

228
00:23:30,771 --> 00:23:32,022
It looks like rubbish.

229
00:23:33,357 --> 00:23:35,526
Says who?

230
00:23:35,693 --> 00:23:39,154
This is way better than CJ1.

231
00:23:39,446 --> 00:23:41,615
So, what's it called?

232
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,620
It's called CJ7.

233
00:23:46,954 --> 00:23:48,872
Pathetic piece of crap.

234
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:52,710
Your dad found it in the garbage.

235
00:23:53,127 --> 00:23:55,629
Don't talk about my dad like that!
I'm going to beat you up.

236
00:23:56,005 --> 00:23:57,840
Oh, yeah?

237
00:24:13,188 --> 00:24:14,523
Hello.

238
00:24:52,728 --> 00:24:54,563
How many times do I have to tell you?

239
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:57,775
We might be poor, but we don't fight.

240
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,777
You really disappoint me.

241
00:24:59,943 --> 00:25:03,238
Look at this. Your uniform's all torn.

242
00:25:03,739 --> 00:25:05,282
What was the fight about?

243
00:25:07,076 --> 00:25:08,452
They were laughing at me.

244
00:25:08,786 --> 00:25:10,120
What about?

245
00:25:16,251 --> 00:25:18,212
Well?

246
00:25:27,596 --> 00:25:28,764
Fine.

247
00:25:30,516 --> 00:25:32,434
If you're not going to tell me...

248
00:25:37,064 --> 00:25:38,982
then I have no choice in the matter.

249
00:25:52,121 --> 00:25:53,122
Last chance!

250
00:25:59,294 --> 00:26:00,754
It's moving!

251
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:31,493
There are ghosts.

252
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,995
Ghosts? Where?

253
00:26:33,954 --> 00:26:35,080
There. In the ball.

254
00:26:35,247 --> 00:26:38,208
Don't change the subject!

255
00:26:38,876 --> 00:26:43,672
You think you can run rings around me,
but you're not as clever as you think.

256
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:47,843
Your uniform's a mess. What will
you wear for school tomorrow?

257
00:26:50,137 --> 00:26:52,556
Do I have to go hunt for another one?

258
00:26:53,015 --> 00:26:54,975
I'll deal with you later.

259
00:27:11,366 --> 00:27:13,660
There's a ghost! Hanging over there!

260
00:27:14,369 --> 00:27:16,914
Help! Ghost! It's horrible!

261
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,416
There's a red ghost hanging there!

262
00:27:20,542 --> 00:27:23,879
Hanging! Too horrible!

263
00:27:24,046 --> 00:27:25,422
Calm down!

264
00:27:25,923 --> 00:27:28,008
It's a broken lamp. Can't you see?

265
00:27:37,726 --> 00:27:39,019
Not again!

266
00:27:39,186 --> 00:27:40,687
You're a ghost too.

267
00:27:40,854 --> 00:27:45,525
Stop shouting! I'll send you outside
if you don't stop! Understand?

268
00:28:25,482 --> 00:28:27,609
Are you on drugs or something?

269
00:28:31,446 --> 00:28:33,782
What are you doing?

270
00:28:33,949 --> 00:28:35,659
Please don't lock me in!

271
00:28:35,826 --> 00:28:38,954
There's a ghost. You have to believe me.

272
00:28:39,121 --> 00:28:41,290
Let me out!

273
00:28:41,456 --> 00:28:46,795
Please let me out!

274
00:28:59,975 --> 00:29:02,185
Help me, Lord.

275
00:30:50,919 --> 00:30:53,588
- Learned your lesson now?
- Yes, Dad.

276
00:30:53,755 --> 00:30:55,048
Will you behave yourself now?

277
00:30:55,215 --> 00:30:56,925
I Will. I really Will.

278
00:30:57,467 --> 00:30:59,594
I have to get back to work.

279
00:30:59,928 --> 00:31:02,639
Okay! Off you go. Bye!

280
00:31:41,344 --> 00:31:43,305
Are you from outer space?

281
00:31:46,933 --> 00:31:49,102
Have you come to invade Earth?

282
00:32:27,307 --> 00:32:32,562
I think you might be an alien toy dog.

283
00:32:56,503 --> 00:32:57,712
My name is Dicky.

284
00:32:57,879 --> 00:33:00,090
Can I call you CJ7?

285
00:33:01,716 --> 00:33:04,010
If you wag your tail, it means you like it!

286
00:33:04,386 --> 00:33:05,887
CJ7!

287
00:34:01,401 --> 00:34:03,486
The apples in our house are always rotten.

288
00:34:03,653 --> 00:34:05,447
So how come this one's not?

289
00:34:05,614 --> 00:34:06,990
You know magic?

290
00:34:12,329 --> 00:34:15,290
Wow! It's so sweet. You really do know magic.

291
00:34:15,498 --> 00:34:17,834
I'm going to be rich!

292
00:34:34,934 --> 00:34:39,147
If you can beat the most vicious dog on Earth...

293
00:34:39,314 --> 00:34:43,693
then you really are a superdog from space.

294
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:44,944
Go!

295
00:35:11,346 --> 00:35:13,223
Oh, my God!

296
00:35:33,827 --> 00:35:37,872
I have a test today and I've been
playing with you instead of studying.

297
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:41,376
But I really want to get 100. Can you help me?

298
00:36:01,062 --> 00:36:02,397
What's that you're making?

299
00:36:09,529 --> 00:36:11,239
Dicky Chow.

300
00:36:12,407 --> 00:36:14,743
Why are you wearing those glasses?

301
00:36:14,909 --> 00:36:16,828
My eyes hurt. Do you want to take a look?

302
00:36:16,995 --> 00:36:20,165
No, I don't. Sit down.

303
00:36:22,917 --> 00:36:26,254
Begin writing now!

304
00:37:43,331 --> 00:37:45,959
Sorry, sir. There was a fly.

305
00:37:46,251 --> 00:37:48,086
A fly?

306
00:37:51,422 --> 00:37:54,133
Sorry, sir. There was a fly.

307
00:38:05,895 --> 00:38:08,439
I now have the results of today's test.

308
00:38:08,606 --> 00:38:11,442
And for the first time, Dicky Chow got 100.

309
00:38:18,449 --> 00:38:20,159
- Thank you, sir!
- Hold on a minute.

310
00:38:21,661 --> 00:38:24,163
I want to see those glasses.

311
00:38:42,974 --> 00:38:45,810
Those super-glasses were fantastic!

312
00:38:45,977 --> 00:38:49,564
It's P.E. next, so I'll need super-sneakers!

313
00:38:59,574 --> 00:39:01,159
This is so exciting.

314
00:39:06,998 --> 00:39:10,168
Excellence at the high jump...

315
00:39:10,335 --> 00:39:12,003
requires talent, hard work...

316
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:14,505
training, a good night's sleep...

317
00:39:14,672 --> 00:39:16,633
and finally, respect for your teacher.

318
00:39:16,799 --> 00:39:18,468
This is my personal record.

319
00:39:18,635 --> 00:39:21,095
So far no one has bettered it.

320
00:39:29,395 --> 00:39:32,231
I have new sneakers today, sir.

321
00:39:34,567 --> 00:39:37,654
Sir! He just broke your record.

322
00:39:44,911 --> 00:39:50,249
Dicky, it doesn't ring true
that a kid can jump that high.

323
00:39:51,084 --> 00:39:53,044
Be a good boy and do it again.

324
00:41:15,251 --> 00:41:17,670
Dicky Chow. What are those shoes you're wearing?

325
00:41:17,837 --> 00:41:19,255
It's none of your business!

326
00:41:19,422 --> 00:41:20,840
This is too much.

327
00:41:21,007 --> 00:41:22,884
You drove me to this.

328
00:41:23,051 --> 00:41:24,093
Come down!

329
00:41:46,574 --> 00:41:49,452
- Dicky! Are you out of your mind?
- I...

330
00:41:49,869 --> 00:41:52,163
Over here. Catch him!

331
00:41:52,747 --> 00:41:54,916
Come to your senses, Dicky.

332
00:41:55,291 --> 00:42:00,004
Miss Yuen, bitterness, like the sea, is boundless.

333
00:42:02,924 --> 00:42:04,008
Dicky!

334
00:42:04,175 --> 00:42:07,303
Dicky Chow! How can you jump
so high? Come down this minute!

335
00:42:43,548 --> 00:42:46,634
How on earth can you sleep like that?

336
00:42:47,218 --> 00:42:49,512
Wake up. It's nearly time for school.

337
00:42:52,223 --> 00:42:55,601
What do I have to do to get you up in the morning?

338
00:42:57,061 --> 00:42:58,229
It was all a dream?

339
00:43:03,943 --> 00:43:05,486
You're real.

340
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:07,989
I'm getting ready right now!

341
00:43:10,992 --> 00:43:13,911
Dad, I'm going to get 100 on the exam today.

342
00:43:14,287 --> 00:43:15,288
What?

343
00:43:15,454 --> 00:43:16,873
"M going to get 100!"

344
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:18,124
Really?

345
00:43:18,291 --> 00:43:22,545
Yes! All on my own! 100!

346
00:43:23,629 --> 00:43:26,299
That's great.

347
00:43:38,394 --> 00:43:42,690
If you can beat the most vicious dog on Earth...

348
00:43:42,857 --> 00:43:47,153
then you really are a superdog from space.

349
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,362
Go!

350
00:44:12,595 --> 00:44:13,971
Run!

351
00:44:36,827 --> 00:44:38,788
So, what happened back there?

352
00:44:42,667 --> 00:44:45,378
You're supposed to be the superdog from space.

353
00:44:45,544 --> 00:44:47,672
Don't tell me you were just pretending.

354
00:44:47,838 --> 00:44:50,591
Seriously.

355
00:44:50,758 --> 00:44:53,344
I have to get 100 on the exam.

356
00:44:53,511 --> 00:44:57,515
I need you to work your magic for me.

357
00:44:59,058 --> 00:45:01,727
Come on, now. Please! I'm not joking.

358
00:45:05,106 --> 00:45:06,732
You have to give me magic weapons.

359
00:46:14,050 --> 00:46:15,134
Time's up.

360
00:46:15,301 --> 00:46:18,012
What? But I haven't started yet.

361
00:46:20,723 --> 00:46:22,433
What's with the turd?

362
00:46:23,642 --> 00:46:25,394
Turd? It's not that!

363
00:46:25,561 --> 00:46:27,438
Shows how much you know!

364
00:46:38,032 --> 00:46:40,326
You set me up!

365
00:46:44,038 --> 00:46:46,707
I'm going to kill you!

366
00:46:50,961 --> 00:46:53,172
Give me the magic weapons now!

367
00:47:03,808 --> 00:47:06,102
Why, you...

368
00:47:11,023 --> 00:47:12,274
You...

369
00:47:31,377 --> 00:47:33,295
Please, sir. Can I say something?

370
00:47:33,462 --> 00:47:34,964
No, you can't.

371
00:47:36,549 --> 00:47:38,175
You are a poor student.

372
00:47:38,342 --> 00:47:41,011
You are always dirty, and you are very wicked.

373
00:47:41,178 --> 00:47:43,639
You discredit the school.

374
00:47:43,806 --> 00:47:45,641
There's nothing more to say.

375
00:47:46,058 --> 00:47:47,726
Now clean him up!

376
00:47:59,071 --> 00:48:00,656
CJ7?

377
00:48:00,948 --> 00:48:03,075
Please come out.

378
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:06,745
Why would I be mad at you?

379
00:48:06,954 --> 00:48:09,206
We're good friends.

380
00:48:09,415 --> 00:48:12,877
The turd wasn't important.

381
00:48:13,127 --> 00:48:15,337
I've seen it all before.

382
00:48:15,629 --> 00:48:20,092
Let's just forget it ever happened. Okay?

383
00:48:20,468 --> 00:48:24,680
In fact, I love you very much. Do you know that?

384
00:48:27,558 --> 00:48:29,935
(3.17? Come here.

385
00:48:31,479 --> 00:48:33,439
Closer!

386
00:48:44,074 --> 00:48:46,035
I'm going to stab you to death!

387
00:48:52,625 --> 00:48:56,712
Rubbish dog from space. You're low-tech and boring.

388
00:48:56,879 --> 00:49:00,799
I got blamed and laughed at. And all because of you.

389
00:49:00,966 --> 00:49:05,054
If you're just an animal, then say so!
Don't pretend you have magic powers!

390
00:49:06,847 --> 00:49:09,475
But did it ever say that?

391
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:12,645
Did I get it wrong?

392
00:49:17,191 --> 00:49:18,567
Have I made a mistake?

393
00:49:18,734 --> 00:49:20,861
I know I've made a mistake!

394
00:49:35,251 --> 00:49:36,710
Wait!

395
00:49:36,877 --> 00:49:40,214
Hey! Wait!

396
00:49:40,548 --> 00:49:42,841
Wait!

397
00:49:55,688 --> 00:49:56,814
Dicky! What's happened?

398
00:49:56,981 --> 00:49:59,149
CJ7 has disappeared.

399
00:50:04,488 --> 00:50:05,906
Look.

400
00:50:11,495 --> 00:50:12,496
CJ7?

401
00:50:14,498 --> 00:50:16,333
I'm sorry. I missed you so much.

402
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:19,420
I thought I'd never see you again.

403
00:50:23,716 --> 00:50:26,093
And you're not angry with me.

404
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:31,682
You two already met?

405
00:50:34,935 --> 00:50:36,395
Is it a toy?

406
00:50:36,562 --> 00:50:37,688
Yes, it is.

407
00:50:40,190 --> 00:50:42,109
And it can walk and move its eyes?

408
00:50:42,276 --> 00:50:43,611
Where did you get it?

409
00:50:43,777 --> 00:50:45,446
Someone at school lent it to me.

410
00:50:48,449 --> 00:50:50,075
Where's the cover?

411
00:50:50,743 --> 00:50:52,411
Where do the batteries go?

412
00:50:52,578 --> 00:50:55,289
It doesn't need them. It's high-tech.

413
00:50:55,623 --> 00:50:59,251
I've never seen anything like it before.

414
00:51:04,465 --> 00:51:05,633
Did you see that?

415
00:51:05,799 --> 00:51:06,800
Yes, I did.

416
00:51:06,967 --> 00:51:08,969
It's all bendy.

417
00:51:09,261 --> 00:51:11,805
Don't! I have to give it back soon.

418
00:51:11,972 --> 00:51:13,265
It's fine.

419
00:51:13,432 --> 00:51:15,976
- What are you doing, Dad?
- Nothing!

420
00:51:28,656 --> 00:51:32,284
See, I told you it'd be fine.
It gets its shape back. Look!

421
00:51:32,493 --> 00:51:33,827
This is fun.

422
00:51:33,994 --> 00:51:37,289
No more squeezing it! That's enough!

423
00:51:37,665 --> 00:51:40,125
Everything is high-tech nowadays.

424
00:51:40,292 --> 00:51:44,838
Basically there's no future
for uneducated people like us.

425
00:51:45,923 --> 00:51:50,260
Dad, I don't want to lie to you, so...

426
00:51:50,427 --> 00:51:53,639
CJ7 came out of the ball you gave me.

427
00:51:53,806 --> 00:51:56,141
It came from outer space.

428
00:51:57,768 --> 00:51:59,812
How many times do I have to tell you?

429
00:51:59,978 --> 00:52:03,774
We might be poor, but we don't lie...

430
00:52:03,941 --> 00:52:05,693
we don't fight...

431
00:52:05,859 --> 00:52:09,113
and we don't take things that don't belong to us.

432
00:52:09,363 --> 00:52:13,534
Study hard and be a useful person in the future.

433
00:52:25,504 --> 00:52:28,048
It's so hot.

434
00:54:23,247 --> 00:54:26,333
Well, I'll be... The hottest night
and it starts to work. Lucky, or what?

435
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:27,543
I'm off to school now.

436
00:54:27,709 --> 00:54:29,670
- Have you got your lunch box?
- Yes, I have.

437
00:54:29,837 --> 00:54:32,297
Hey. How was the exam?

438
00:54:37,594 --> 00:54:40,681
How come your head's gone red?

439
00:54:41,181 --> 00:54:43,016
You don't look so good today.

440
00:54:43,183 --> 00:54:45,686
Didn't you sleep last night?

441
00:54:50,023 --> 00:54:51,692
Get inside and go to sleep.

442
00:54:52,526 --> 00:54:54,528
You! Stop!

443
00:54:54,695 --> 00:54:56,446
What's that thing inside your bag?

444
00:54:56,613 --> 00:54:57,948
Nothing.

445
00:54:58,866 --> 00:55:00,367
I need to check your schoolbag!

446
00:55:02,035 --> 00:55:03,328
What for?

447
00:55:03,495 --> 00:55:05,706
I don't have to tell you that.

448
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:12,379
Let go!

449
00:55:20,304 --> 00:55:21,388
What's that?

450
00:55:21,972 --> 00:55:23,223
Let me see.

451
00:55:23,390 --> 00:55:25,350
Give it to me! Let me see first!

452
00:55:25,517 --> 00:55:28,687
Give it to me! Don't pull!

453
00:55:32,566 --> 00:55:33,692
Get it!

454
00:55:52,878 --> 00:55:54,212
What is this weird thing?

455
00:55:54,379 --> 00:55:56,340
Don't touch it! Give it back to me!

456
00:55:56,506 --> 00:55:57,966
Get the tool box!

457
00:56:01,511 --> 00:56:02,763
Open it up and look inside.

458
00:56:02,930 --> 00:56:04,014
Here.

459
00:56:05,265 --> 00:56:07,893
Let him go!

460
00:56:08,727 --> 00:56:09,978
Can't do it.

461
00:56:10,145 --> 00:56:11,647
Try this.

462
00:56:14,066 --> 00:56:16,777
No! Don't do that!

463
00:56:17,194 --> 00:56:18,278
It's not working.

464
00:56:18,445 --> 00:56:19,863
How is that possible?

465
00:56:34,252 --> 00:56:35,671
You won't do that to my thing!

466
00:56:35,837 --> 00:56:37,255
So what? Going to hit me?

467
00:56:37,422 --> 00:56:39,716
You won't know what's hit you!

468
00:56:48,350 --> 00:56:51,269
Let him go!

469
00:57:00,028 --> 00:57:01,113
You let him go.

470
00:57:01,279 --> 00:57:03,031
You let me go first.

471
00:57:48,702 --> 00:57:50,537
I don't want a fight.

472
00:58:11,141 --> 00:58:12,851
Don't force me to do this!

473
00:58:38,668 --> 00:58:39,753
Are you okay?

474
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:42,339
I'm fine. Thank you.

475
00:58:42,839 --> 00:58:43,965
You're welcome.

476
00:58:44,132 --> 00:58:45,592
What's going on here?

477
00:58:47,761 --> 00:58:50,347
Why were you fighting? Tell me!

478
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:54,559
You're going to stand here until you tell me!

479
00:58:59,606 --> 00:59:00,941
CJ7!

480
00:59:04,444 --> 00:59:06,113
I knew you'd be okay!

481
00:59:06,279 --> 00:59:07,823
Stop. Don't.

482
00:59:07,989 --> 00:59:08,990
Good boy.

483
00:59:09,157 --> 00:59:11,493
What is that thing?

484
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:13,495
Look! CJ7, sit!

485
00:59:15,831 --> 00:59:17,124
That's cool.

486
00:59:17,290 --> 00:59:19,042
What else does it do?

487
00:59:19,209 --> 00:59:20,627
CJ7, happy face!

488
00:59:21,503 --> 00:59:22,838
Angry face!

489
00:59:23,797 --> 00:59:24,798
Sad face!

490
00:59:27,801 --> 00:59:28,844
(Saw a pretty lad)”

491
00:59:30,554 --> 00:59:32,139
Your apartment's on fire.

492
00:59:33,807 --> 00:59:35,475
But you just won the lottery!

493
00:59:36,476 --> 00:59:38,353
Oops! The whole family is dead.

494
00:59:40,063 --> 00:59:41,940
You've got 100 on the exam!

495
00:59:45,026 --> 00:59:46,403
Wicked.

496
00:59:46,570 --> 00:59:47,654
Look!

497
00:59:53,493 --> 00:59:56,454
Wow, fireworks!

498
00:59:57,956 --> 00:59:59,791
Where did you get it?

499
00:59:59,958 --> 01:00:01,585
I want one too.

500
01:00:01,751 --> 01:00:03,086
I can't tell you that.

501
01:00:03,253 --> 01:00:06,464
But I want to thank you
for not telling Mr. Cao about this.

502
01:00:06,631 --> 01:00:07,674
Of course not!

503
01:00:07,841 --> 01:00:10,302
We don't discuss our business with adults.

504
01:00:10,468 --> 01:00:11,988
- You have my word!
- You have my word!

505
01:00:14,264 --> 01:00:17,851
Hey, you're amazing. Do you want to be on our judo team?

506
01:00:18,018 --> 01:00:19,978
They'd all make fun of me.

507
01:00:20,145 --> 01:00:21,855
They wouldn't dare.

508
01:00:22,022 --> 01:00:23,815
Would you make fun of her?

509
01:00:43,501 --> 01:00:46,713
Look at this. My son got 100 on his exam.

510
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:47,964
That's a great kid!

511
01:00:48,131 --> 01:00:49,382
Yes!

512
01:00:51,593 --> 01:00:53,386
- Look!
- Get away!

513
01:00:53,553 --> 01:00:55,305
He got 100.

514
01:00:56,973 --> 01:01:00,894
Boss. My kid got 100 on his exam.

515
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:03,104
So he cheated.

516
01:01:06,942 --> 01:01:08,401
What makes you say that?

517
01:01:08,568 --> 01:01:11,488
My son's really smart, but even
he can't pass without cheating.

518
01:01:11,655 --> 01:01:14,491
So how can your son get 100? Hard to believe, dickhead.

519
01:01:14,658 --> 01:01:16,576
You're not serious.

520
01:01:18,995 --> 01:01:23,541
Look at the ink. He got zero
and changed it to 100. He's a liar.

521
01:01:24,876 --> 01:01:28,380
But he's not like that. I know him better.

522
01:01:28,546 --> 01:01:29,798
Your son cheated.

523
01:01:29,965 --> 01:01:31,925
- I can't let you say that.
- He cheated!

524
01:01:32,092 --> 01:01:33,885
I'll hit you if you say that again.

525
01:01:34,594 --> 01:01:35,971
Your son cheated.

526
01:01:36,137 --> 01:01:38,682
You hit me? Just you try!

527
01:01:50,318 --> 01:01:52,696
Your son cheated! You hit me?

528
01:01:52,862 --> 01:01:54,823
You're fired!

529
01:01:55,115 --> 01:01:56,783
Your son cheated!

530
01:02:20,515 --> 01:02:21,891
Quick!

531
01:02:22,309 --> 01:02:23,601
Get inside.

532
01:02:27,522 --> 01:02:30,775
Tell the truth. Did you cheat on your exam?

533
01:02:31,109 --> 01:02:32,110
No, I didn't.

534
01:02:32,277 --> 01:02:36,489
I think you got zero,
then altered it to 100. Is that right?

535
01:02:38,992 --> 01:02:40,201
Yes.

536
01:02:40,660 --> 01:02:44,414
But that's not the same as cheating.
I didn't want you to be disappointed.

537
01:02:44,581 --> 01:02:46,124
What's wrong with you?

538
01:02:46,291 --> 01:02:49,252
It's so tough to send you to that school.

539
01:02:50,545 --> 01:02:51,963
I'm sorry, Dad.

540
01:02:52,255 --> 01:02:54,924
I'll say it again. Even though we're poor...

541
01:02:55,091 --> 01:02:56,509
Okay! I know!

542
01:02:56,676 --> 01:02:59,804
You're so annoying. Can you stop going on about it?

543
01:03:01,765 --> 01:03:04,768
I changed it. So what?

544
01:03:23,328 --> 01:03:26,039
If there's nothing else, I'm leaving.

545
01:03:30,543 --> 01:03:33,254
What are you doing?

546
01:03:33,421 --> 01:03:34,839
Why are you taking my things?

547
01:03:35,006 --> 01:03:37,967
If you can't work hard, then you don't get to play.

548
01:03:38,134 --> 01:03:39,886
- Give it back to me!
- No.

549
01:03:40,053 --> 01:03:41,721
Why are you taking my stuff?

550
01:03:41,888 --> 01:03:45,058
Why? Because I'm your father! And I can!

551
01:03:45,225 --> 01:03:48,228
You're bullying me. I don't have a dad like you!

552
01:03:48,395 --> 01:03:50,855
You always get zeros. I don't have a son like you.

553
01:03:51,022 --> 01:03:52,732
Leave me alone!

554
01:03:52,899 --> 01:03:54,150
Say it again!

555
01:03:54,317 --> 01:03:56,653
Leave me alone forever!

556
01:03:56,820 --> 01:03:58,238
Okay!

557
01:03:59,114 --> 01:04:02,742
If you can use your own brains to get over 60...

558
01:04:02,909 --> 01:04:04,619
then I'll leave you alone forever!

559
01:04:04,786 --> 01:04:06,371
- It's a deal!
- It's a deal!

560
01:04:06,579 --> 01:04:09,290
I'm going to get that grade. Just watch me!

561
01:04:09,457 --> 01:04:12,752
We'll see about that, Zero Hero!

562
01:04:12,919 --> 01:04:16,214
That's not fair! I'll show you!

563
01:04:16,381 --> 01:04:18,800
Don't bother me anymore!

564
01:04:23,513 --> 01:04:25,181
What are you looking at?

565
01:04:36,734 --> 01:04:38,236
- Mr. Chow.
- Miss Yuen.

566
01:04:38,403 --> 01:04:40,603
- Is something wrong? Please come in.
- I won't, thanks.

567
01:04:40,697 --> 01:04:43,825
But Dicky forgot his lunch box today.
Could you see that he gets it?

568
01:04:43,992 --> 01:04:46,244
Sure. Let me ask someone to open the gate.

569
01:04:46,411 --> 01:04:50,457
No, please don't. If his classmates
see me, he'll never live it down.

570
01:04:50,623 --> 01:04:51,624
How come?

571
01:04:51,791 --> 01:04:53,376
- I have to go.
- Wait.

572
01:04:54,669 --> 01:04:57,213
Dicky told me everything.

573
01:04:57,380 --> 01:04:59,507
He was just being temperamental.

574
01:04:59,674 --> 01:05:02,844
If you'd allow it, he could
come to my house after school.

575
01:05:03,011 --> 01:05:04,929
We can talk about what happened.

576
01:05:05,221 --> 01:05:08,141
And there's another exam tomorrow,
so I can help him to review.

577
01:05:08,308 --> 01:05:09,517
What do you think?

578
01:05:09,976 --> 01:05:11,144
Oh, thank you. Thank you!

579
01:05:11,311 --> 01:05:14,314
- You're welcome. It's nothing at all.
- I appreciate this so much.

580
01:05:14,481 --> 01:05:17,317
- It's just a small thing. Nothing, really.
- It's not nothing.

581
01:05:17,484 --> 01:05:18,651
The thing is...

582
01:05:18,818 --> 01:05:22,489
I can't give him very much myself,
and that makes me feel very guilty.

583
01:05:22,655 --> 01:05:26,826
But if you were to help him study,
I could never repay you.

584
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:30,121
You really don't have to. It's the least I can do.

585
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:32,749
Then I'll leave him in your hands.

586
01:05:33,166 --> 01:05:35,001
Sure. You just leave Dicky to me.

587
01:05:35,335 --> 01:05:37,962
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

588
01:06:12,914 --> 01:06:14,958
How's the boss feeling today?

589
01:06:15,124 --> 01:06:16,543
You dare to come back?

590
01:06:16,709 --> 01:06:18,211
I have to. I need to eat.

591
01:06:40,275 --> 01:06:43,861
I know I have a big mouth,
but I think we understand each other.

592
01:06:44,028 --> 01:06:45,071
What?

593
01:06:45,238 --> 01:06:49,075
I shouldn't have said that
about your son. Let's forget it. Here.

594
01:06:50,118 --> 01:06:51,619
Well...

595
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:54,414
- But he really did cheat.
- Who doesn't, sometimes?

596
01:06:54,581 --> 01:06:57,208
The kid is very smart. I know he'll be successful.

597
01:06:57,375 --> 01:06:59,586
I pray to God that you're right.

598
01:06:59,752 --> 01:07:01,713
So take it and buy him some candy.

599
01:07:01,879 --> 01:07:03,214
Hey! This is far too much.

600
01:07:03,381 --> 01:07:06,843
Use it for books, then. Or school fees.
But now get back to work.

601
01:07:13,141 --> 01:07:14,934
Today must be my lucky day.

602
01:08:44,732 --> 01:08:47,193
I thought you'd never pass.

603
01:08:49,821 --> 01:08:50,822
Good.

604
01:08:51,489 --> 01:08:52,615
Thanks, Mr. Cao.

605
01:08:52,782 --> 01:08:54,534
What's happening?

606
01:08:55,201 --> 01:08:56,661
Where's your safety belt?

607
01:09:29,569 --> 01:09:30,903
What's going on here?

608
01:09:33,740 --> 01:09:35,908
Help!

609
01:09:37,410 --> 01:09:39,245
Give me your hand!

610
01:09:39,412 --> 01:09:43,374
Reach out! Give me your hand!

611
01:09:47,378 --> 01:09:50,715
Why haven't these been moved?

612
01:09:51,090 --> 01:09:53,468
What was that? Hey! Be careful!

613
01:10:05,730 --> 01:10:07,440
I'm so sorry.

614
01:10:08,608 --> 01:10:11,152
Dicky, you have to come with me.

615
01:11:27,103 --> 01:11:29,814
Is this your house, Dicky?

616
01:11:34,318 --> 01:11:36,737
Are you hungry? Do you want to eat?

617
01:11:49,333 --> 01:11:52,837
Dicky, I'm going to tell you something.

618
01:12:01,262 --> 01:12:05,308
There was a terrible accident, and your dad passed away.

619
01:12:27,163 --> 01:12:31,626
There are some things
we can't control. Do you understand?

620
01:12:32,335 --> 01:12:35,338
Don't talk anymore, miss. I want to sleep.

621
01:12:35,504 --> 01:12:37,256
Please leave me.

622
01:12:37,757 --> 01:12:40,885
Dicky, open the door.

623
01:12:41,218 --> 01:12:42,261
I'm sorry.

624
01:12:42,428 --> 01:12:43,763
Miss Yuen...

625
01:12:45,932 --> 01:12:47,683
I'm very tired.

626
01:12:49,435 --> 01:12:53,189
I need to sleep.

627
01:12:55,775 --> 01:12:57,234
Dicky.

628
01:12:59,111 --> 01:13:02,281
My dad won't leave me alone.

629
01:13:04,075 --> 01:13:08,788
He'll be home when I wake up.

630
01:13:09,956 --> 01:13:12,416
I need to sleep now.

631
01:13:16,087 --> 01:13:17,505
Dicky.

632
01:13:31,102 --> 01:13:32,812
Dad.

633
01:16:27,486 --> 01:16:29,363
Why aren't you in your pajamas?

634
01:16:43,252 --> 01:16:44,545
Hey. What's up?

635
01:16:45,671 --> 01:16:49,425
Dad, don't ever leave me.

636
01:16:54,221 --> 01:16:56,515
I'll listen to you...

637
01:16:56,765 --> 01:16:58,601
I'll study hard...

638
01:16:58,767 --> 01:17:00,019
I won't lie...

639
01:17:00,186 --> 01:17:01,687
I won't fight...

640
01:17:01,854 --> 01:17:05,357
and one day I'll be a really useful person.

641
01:17:06,859 --> 01:17:08,235
That's good.

642
01:17:27,963 --> 01:17:29,298
CJ7!

643
01:17:30,716 --> 01:17:32,468
How are you?

644
01:17:38,224 --> 01:17:39,892
What's that noise?

645
01:17:40,059 --> 01:17:41,894
Yeah, what is it?

646
01:17:43,312 --> 01:17:44,730
Why are you so tired, CJ7?

647
01:18:38,617 --> 01:18:40,661
What's happened to him, Dad?

648
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:42,663
Maybe the batteries have run out.

649
01:18:42,830 --> 01:18:44,790
It wouldn't look like that!

650
01:18:44,957 --> 01:18:46,792
But it's very high-tech.

651
01:20:21,887 --> 01:20:23,764
<i>The new term starts soon...</i>

652
01:20:23,931 --> 01:20:26,642
<i>and we have a picnic before going back.</i>

653
01:20:26,809 --> 01:20:28,977
<i>Everybody's very happy-.</i>

654
01:20:29,269 --> 01:20:31,605
<i>Storm Dragon doesn't fight anymore...</i>

655
01:20:31,772 --> 01:20:34,190
<i>because he's fallen in love.</i>

656
01:20:42,741 --> 01:20:45,160
<i>Maggie likes me best...</i>

657
01:20:53,585 --> 01:20:56,504
<i>but my love is Fanny.</i>

658
01:20:58,506 --> 01:21:00,425
<i>And she loves me very much too!</i>

659
01:21:06,473 --> 01:21:08,433
<i>Johnny always takes what's mine.</i>

660
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:11,770
<i>Maybe he'll stop when I tell the teacher about him.</i>

661
01:21:13,980 --> 01:21:17,108
<i>Every pupil has his own true love.</i>

662
01:21:17,275 --> 01:21:19,277
<i>And so has my dad.</i>

663
01:21:33,124 --> 01:21:37,462
It's just amazing. When we saw you in
the hospital you appeared to be quite...

664
01:21:37,629 --> 01:21:41,800
Dead, yes. But now I'm right as rain.
Not even the doctors can explain it.

665
01:21:41,966 --> 01:21:44,219
And how have you been since then?

666
01:21:44,385 --> 01:21:46,221
Well, I do have a bit of a problem.

667
01:21:46,387 --> 01:21:47,889
What kind of problem?

668
01:21:48,056 --> 01:21:50,141
I'm far too handsome.

669
01:21:53,311 --> 01:21:54,979
Very funny.

670
01:21:56,815 --> 01:21:58,316
I mean it.

671
01:22:01,569 --> 01:22:03,905
<i>It's not easy to win a girl over...</i>

672
01:22:04,072 --> 01:22:06,241
<i>especially if you're not that funny.</i>

673
01:22:06,407 --> 01:22:08,034
<i>But Dad won't give up. He's my hero.</i>

674
01:22:08,201 --> 01:22:12,747
You don't think I'm handsome,
Miss Yuen? You can't be serious.

675
01:22:18,586 --> 01:22:20,505
<i>I'm so lucky that I still have you, CJ7.</i>

676
01:22:20,672 --> 01:22:22,507
<i>Every day, while you sleep...</i>

677
01:22:22,674 --> 01:22:25,343
<i>I close my eyes and count to three...</i>

678
01:22:25,510 --> 01:22:29,097
<i>hoping when I look again, you'll wake.</i>

679
01:22:29,764 --> 01:22:33,268
<i>I want you back so much. Where are you, CJ7?</i>

680
01:22:36,271 --> 01:22:40,066
One, two, three...
