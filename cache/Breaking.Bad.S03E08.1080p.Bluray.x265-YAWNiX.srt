1
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:21,957
Think you'll be okay
waiting here by yourself?

2
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:25,627
Yeah, whatever.

3
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:30,632
Sir, if you'd like to smoke, you need
to be another 20 feet from the door.

4
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,802
80 roll me further, bitch.

5
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:56,700
What's coming?

6
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:59,995
Male, Caucasian. Early 403.
Multiple gunshot wounds.

7
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:06,668
BP is 70. Seven-zero over palp.

8
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:10,797
Pulse 140. One-four-zero.
Weak and thready at the brachial.

9
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,383
No breath sounds on the right side,
belly is rigid.

10
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,053
Appears pale and diaphoretio.
How many entry wounds?

11
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,513
Four. Shoulder and hip,
through and through.

12
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,351
Right lung in lower left quadrant,
no visible exit wounds.

13
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:24,019
Let's get him 2 grams of oxygen.

14
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:26,521
- What's his hemoglobin?
- Seven-point-three.

15
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:30,192
Need two large-bore ivs,
six units o-neg.

16
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:33,236
Type and cross for six more units,
chest X-ray and kub.

17
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:36,323
Notify the or, we are on the way.

18
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:40,202
Or 1 is clear. Let's put him in there.

19
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:13,026
Yo, Jesse, sorry I'm late, man.

20
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:18,240
Damn, brother, look at you.

21
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:20,575
That's messed up.

22
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,245
How are you feeling? You okay?

23
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,247
Actually...

24
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:29,251
I'm great.

25
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:54,276
I don't understand.

26
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:56,611
I thought things
were going pretty well.

27
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:00,490
I thought we were kind of simpatico.

28
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:04,369
You know?
We were becoming a real team.

29
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:08,957
Not... not so much, no.

30
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:13,503
Is this about the temperature setting?
I can assure you that will not happen...

31
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,505
No, it's bigger than that, Gale.

32
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:19,468
It's much more than that.

33
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:21,511
Could you elaborate?

34
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,181
Well, yes, of course I could...

35
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:28,018
But I don't think either of us...

36
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:31,021
Would necessarily benefit
from a prolonged...

37
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,150
Yeah, so...

38
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:39,279
I set up the entire lab.

39
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,823
You said you liked the configuration.

40
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,994
For the most part.

41
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:51,124
Look, you're a fine chemist, really,
with a promising future.

42
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,461
It's just that I...

43
00:04:54,628 --> 00:05:01,676
That we just have different rhythms,
Gale.

44
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,178
You see... it's...

45
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:08,058
It's as if I'm classical...

46
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:13,814
But you are more jazz.

47
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,567
- â€”Jazz.
- Jazz. Yes.

48
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,529
And god knows
there is nothing wrong with jazz.

49
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:26,368
It's simply that I require...

50
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:29,246
- Classical.
- Exactly.

51
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,375
Oh, shit.

52
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:36,545
Man, this is the bomb.

53
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,762
What's up, partner?

54
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,393
- I can't believe this.
- My replacement?

55
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,603
Oh, Jesus.

56
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,273
Hi. Gale.

57
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,608
- Nice to meet you.
- What's up?

58
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,361
Damn, we should've ditched that rv
months ago.

59
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:04,072
It's all, like, shiny up in here.

60
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:11,788
I'm sorry, I must be missing something.
I don't mean... I don't mean to be...

61
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,958
-This...

62
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:18,879
Makes no sense.

63
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:31,099
So I guess this is...

64
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:36,938
Oh, dear mother of god.

65
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,276
This is for the best.

66
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:45,405
Two hundred pounds a week. Got it?

67
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:49,784
Oh, man.

68
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,843
Okay, there's a lot to show you.

69
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:09,304
Some new techniques to learn.

70
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:12,933
- What, now?
- Yes, now.

71
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:16,102
We've only got a couple days
before our next batch is due.

72
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,979
And I need to get you up to speed.

73
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,068
Right on. I'm just saying...

74
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,155
How's the cell service down here?

75
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:28,990
It's nonexistent.

76
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:33,119
There's a hard line for emergencies.
Come on.

77
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,497
So you haven't talked
to anybody today...

78
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:38,291
Other than, you know,
captain nerd there.

79
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,585
Why?

80
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,380
Your brother-in-law.

81
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,840
What about him?

82
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,346
- What's the story?
- He was unresponsive.

83
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:53,682
You getting exposure
on those wounds?

84
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,892
- Two units of normal saline.
- Bivalve mass.

85
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:59,020
Breath sounds bilaterally.
Femur's like a wet bag of gravel.

86
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,690
Other one's not much better.
Get those boots off.

87
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:04,985
See if you get a pulse.
Get blood-pressure cup or an Abi?

88
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,236
Where's that blood?

89
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:09,364
Dr. Bording to cardiology.

90
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:11,908
Dr. Bording to cardiology.

91
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,327
- Sir, can I help you?
- Yeah, I...

92
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,997
- It's all right. He's family.
- Thank you.

93
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:22,627
Marie. I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry, honey.

94
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,009
I'm so sorry.

95
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:31,761
I don't know what to say.

96
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:40,854
- How is he?
- I don't know.

97
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:43,898
They won't really tell us anything.
He's still in surgery.

98
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,902
They shot him four times.

99
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,864
Oh, Christ.

100
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,746
- Where's Holly?
- I got a sitter.

101
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:03,376
- Hey, how are you, huh?
- Fine.

102
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,045
Yeah?

103
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:12,594
I'm fine. I just need some fresh air.

104
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:15,972
Okay.

105
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:20,602
- Here. Let me get the door.
- I got it. I'm fine.

106
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:28,943
Wait. Wait, this is asac merkert.
Hank's brother-in-law, Walt.

107
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:31,112
- Hello.
- I'm very sorry.

108
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,614
Thank you.

109
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:36,159
Can you tell us anything?
Any details?

110
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:38,953
Right now, all we know
is two men ambushed Hank.

111
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,123
They didn't have any ID on them.
Probably Mexican nationals.

112
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:46,753
Their tattoos indicated an affiliation
with a drug cartel.

113
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,132
Why did they attack Hank?

114
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,801
We're not sure yet.

115
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:56,971
It could be in relation to an
investigation Hank was working...

116
00:09:57,138 --> 00:10:01,643
Or it could be a message
to the DEA in general.

117
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,438
They had an axe.

118
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:09,859
The cartels tend to be dramatic.

119
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:11,861
Jesus.

120
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:17,826
- Where are they? I mean, did they...?
- Hank got both of them.

121
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:21,663
He killed one outright, the other one's
upstairs in critical condition.

122
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:25,542
Your brother-in-law's one tough
son of a bitch to take them both out...

123
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,378
Considering
he didn't even have his gun.

124
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:33,341
He didn't have his gun?

125
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:40,640
Why didn't Hank have his gun?

126
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:43,518
Marie, the assault charge.

127
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:46,521
I had to suspend Hank
pending the investigation.

128
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:49,649
That means
I had to take away his weapon.

129
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,359
You had to take it.

130
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:54,362
- It's standard procedure. No one...
- Okay. All right, listen.

131
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:59,159
If you all listened to him from the start
and let him arrest that degenerate...

132
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,870
He wouldn't have taken things
into his own hands.

133
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:04,706
And he would've had a gun
and could've defended himself.

134
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:07,208
- Marie, let's just...
- No. Just...

135
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:11,087
It's their fault.

136
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:13,339
He didn't have a gun.

137
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,550
Honey, this isn't helping you.

138
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:20,555
What kind of partner are you?

139
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:25,435
You were supposed to back him up,
and where were you?

140
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,520
Where were you?

141
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,564
Texas.

142
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,692
And you.

143
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:36,029
You're supposed
to protect your agents...

144
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,239
Instead of taking their guns...

145
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:41,242
Not supporting them,
not backing them up.

146
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:42,911
- Marie. Marie.
- When they...

147
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:47,707
Honey, let's just go and sit down,
okay?

148
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:52,712
I'm not doing anything until these two
get the hell out of here. I mean it.

149
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:00,094
-Sorry...

150
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,138
You are not welcome here.

151
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:06,726
- The DEA is not welcome here.
- Okay, honey.

152
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,061
Come on.

153
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,605
Come on. Let's go sit down.

154
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,245
It's not just them.

155
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:29,290
It's you, Walt.

156
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:40,134
This Pinkman
that Hank was looking for...

157
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:43,263
Hank would have never
even heard his name...

158
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:47,141
If you hadn't bought marijuana
from him.

159
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:50,270
- Marie...
- Do you ever think about that, Walt?

160
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,146
Do you?

161
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,483
Do you think about everything
that you have put him through?

162
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,694
Marie, stop.

163
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:00,989
You're upset, and you're looking
for someone to blame...

164
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,950
And it's understandable,
but don't blame Walt.

165
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,619
It's not his fault.

166
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:15,712
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

167
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,715
- Sweetheart...
- No. No. Don't...

168
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:26,014
- It's okay.
- It's Hank.

169
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,932
It's all right.

170
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:47,035
All right, you're done.

171
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:51,497
Okay, next.

172
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:31,973
Hello, hello, hello.

173
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:53,077
Yo, yo, yo.
Jesse Pinkman in the house.

174
00:15:55,329 --> 00:16:00,501
Oh, my dear god.

175
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,498
Walter white
to the nearest courtesy phone.

176
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:42,251
Walter white,
please pick up a courtesy phone.

177
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:55,890
Yo, we working sometime this year?

178
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:00,728
What the hell are you thinking?
Why are you calling me here?

179
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:03,523
Tried your cell
and it went straight to voicemail.

180
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:06,192
- How am I to get a hold of you?
- You aren't.

181
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,237
It's been a whole day.
How long is this grieving process?

182
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,072
Just put a clock on it for me.

183
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:14,116
All I'm saying
is we have a schedule, right?

184
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,911
My family
comes before your schedule.

185
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:19,080
Dude, it's not my schedule.

186
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:23,668
- We have responsibilities here.
- I'/I get there when I get there.

187
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:27,797
You know what? Whatever.
I'll just cook on my own.

188
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:30,758
- You will do no such thing.
- Why not?

189
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,594
Well, for starters...

190
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:36,764
You aren't the least bit familiar
with any of the equipment.

191
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:39,433
There's gotta be some sort of manual,
right?

192
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:42,436
- And I can read.
- Jesse, touch nothing.

193
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,814
Stop treating me
like I'm like your assistant.

194
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:48,609
I'm not your bitch to order around.
We're partners. Remember?

195
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:54,949
I need you to sit patiently and wait,
I will be there as soon as I can.

196
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:57,285
Thank you very much
for your kind words.

197
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:01,330
- We really do appreciate that.
- What, is your wife there?

198
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,457
Yes. Yes, she is.

199
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:06,252
She would be happy to know
you asked about her.

200
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,087
Please do keep us in your thoughts.

201
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:10,298
Hey, tell your douche bag
brother-in-law...

202
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,508
To head towards the light.

203
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:19,015
So I'm thinking maybe we should go
get everybody some breakfast.

204
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:22,977
Yeah, that sounds good.
Do you know who that was?

205
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:42,997
You know,
these eggs are really not too bad.

206
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:59,013
- Look at that.
- Look at what?

207
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:02,350
At what? This. These spots.

208
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:05,186
This fork is absolutely filthy.

209
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:12,818
Tell me you see this.
You've got good eyes. Look at that.

210
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:16,322
Marie, those are just water spots.

211
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:17,531
That's fine.

212
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:20,201
Those are not "water spots."

213
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:22,370
It's dirt.

214
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:25,873
This silvennare's
obviously not been cleaned.

215
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,710
It's covered in germs
from someone else's mouth.

216
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:32,171
God knows what.

217
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:36,175
Seriously, aunt Marie,
it's water spots.

218
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:39,387
Ours at home aren't any better.

219
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:42,431
Yours at home are irrelevant.
We're in a hospital.

220
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,768
They need to be a higher standard.
They have a responsibility.

221
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:47,520
Well, I'm not actually sure...

222
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:51,565
If the cafeteria necessarily qualifies
as being part of the hospital.

223
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,902
It's in the same building.
It's all under the same roof.

224
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:56,612
Do you think that sick people...

225
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:59,448
Aren't eating
with this bacteria-infested silvennare?

226
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,827
My god, how are you supposed
to survive this death trap?

227
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,373
Marie...

228
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:11,836
I survived.

229
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:15,881
I had my lobectomy at this hospital.

230
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,717
Remember that?

231
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:21,095
Remember how scared we all were?

232
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:26,934
I didn't wanna act like it,
but I was terrified.

233
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,396
All that week, all I could think of...

234
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:35,151
Was how they were actually
going to cut me open...

235
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:38,446
And take out a part of me...

236
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:41,782
That was with me my entire life.

237
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,243
I couldn't get that image
out of my head.

238
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:53,085
I think the scariest part
was when they took me into pre-op.

239
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:58,424
Lying there,
waiting for them to anesthetize you.

240
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:04,013
Knowing that you may never
wake up again.

241
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:15,149
Actually what I really remember
about that day...

242
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:17,818
Is driving to the hospital.

243
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:20,821
Skyler, you remember me
wanting to drive that day?

244
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:27,161
Anyway, there we are.
We're driving up central...

245
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:30,498
And we hit every green light.

246
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:35,836
I mean,
every single light that we hit... green.

247
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:39,340
It's just... when does that happen?

248
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:45,971
Just like, bang, bang,
green the entire way.

249
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:50,309
And the whole time,
all I could think about was:

250
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:55,856
"Why today? Why?
Why can't I just spend...

251
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:59,151
A few extra minutes in the car
with my family?"

252
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:05,533
I never wanted to be stuck in traffic
so bad in my life.

253
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,870
At least I was with my family.

254
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:13,707
I had that.

255
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:23,217
Anyway, I survived this place.

256
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:27,388
And I'm not half the man
yourhusbandis.

257
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:56,542
Yes?

258
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,919
What the hell is going on up there?

259
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:01,130
I was gonna ask you
the same question.

260
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:02,798
You know about my men?

261
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:06,635
I heard that they attacked a DEA agent.
Why would they do that?

262
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:10,806
What's the matter?
Spanish not good enough anymore?

263
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:15,978
I didn't order this, and my men
would never do this on their own.

264
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:18,939
Someone gave the go-ahead.

265
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:21,400
Are you accusing me?

266
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:24,153
I'm just saying
they wouldn't act on their own.

267
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,448
I am not in the habit
of picking my own pocket.

268
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:31,911
I assume that the next shipment
will be delayed.

269
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:35,581
- Any thoughts on when it might arrive?
- A week, a month.

270
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:39,793
There's too much focus on the border.
We lay low for the time being.

271
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,129
We lay low,
and then we get the real story...

272
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:43,797
From my man who survived.

273
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:46,800
Your man is in custody.

274
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:48,135
God bless america!

275
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:50,846
He's innocent until proven guilty.
Correct?

276
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:52,806
I'll get him the best lawyer...

277
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,975
And then we'll learn the truth.

278
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:57,811
Well, keep me apprised.

279
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,943
Any time you got that close proximity
to the spine...

280
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:06,445
There's always gonna be cause
for concern...

281
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:09,365
But as I say,
it's really too soon to tell.

282
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:12,159
He's out of surgery, at least, which is...

283
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:15,663
- Out of surgery, on his way to recovery.
- All right. And where's that?

284
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:17,831
Unfortunately, you can't see him yet.

285
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:20,167
We're gonna have to wait
for him to stabilize.

286
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,003
How long will that take?

287
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,214
I can't really say. It could be hours.

288
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:28,676
But we'll let you know
just as soon as you can see him.

289
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:31,971
Thank you.

290
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:40,813
Maybe we should get you home
for a couple hours?

291
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,982
Get some rest?

292
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:45,693
I'm not going anywhere.

293
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,820
Me neither.

294
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:57,705
Well, is anyone else
dying to brush their teeth...

295
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,540
Or is it just me?

296
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:04,044
What if I ran over to the house
and picked up a few things?

297
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:06,839
Marie? I could swing by your place.

298
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:10,175
That would be great. Thanks, Walt.

299
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:13,554
Okay.

300
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,696
Wait. Wait.

301
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:32,906
We just heard he came through.

302
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:36,535
Yeah, well, it's, you know,
guardedly good news.

303
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:38,620
- Thank god. I'll take it.
- Yeah.

304
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:41,957
Hey, guys,
this is Hank's brother-in-law, Walt.

305
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:44,293
- Good to meet you. Hi.
- Hey.

306
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:48,047
- We were just swapping Hank stories.
- That could go on all day.

307
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,424
God knows,
there's a million of them.

308
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:55,554
- Meanwhile...
- Miserable piece of shit.

309
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:58,307
Guy who shot him, one that's left,
he's up there.

310
00:25:58,474 --> 00:26:01,310
Got the painkillers going on,
resting comfortably.

311
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:03,103
Your tax dollars at work.

312
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:05,773
You ought to see what Hank did
to that bastard.

313
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,984
Wanna see?

314
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:11,779
Come on, let me show you.

315
00:26:11,803 --> 00:26:19,803
http://hiqve.com/

316
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:35,719
You comfortable, you piece of shit?

317
00:27:33,861 --> 00:27:36,363
- You got him?
- Come on.

318
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:40,033
- All right.
- Easy now, easy.

319
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:14,568
Come here.

320
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,077
Oh, shit.

321
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:29,017
Finally. About damn time.

322
00:29:41,405 --> 00:29:43,949
Why isn't there anything cooking?

323
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,176
Walter white
to the nearest courtesy phone.

324
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:06,680
- Operator.
- This is Walter white.

325
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:08,557
I '/I connect you.

326
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:14,688
Yo, we got prob/ems, big ones.

327
00:30:14,855 --> 00:30:18,567
Reverend, so nice of you to call.
Again.

328
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:20,152
Turn your phone on already.

329
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:23,363
You know,
I will definitely look into that.

330
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:27,409
I'll tell you what. Why don't I just
call you right back on my cell phone?

331
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:29,036
Okay?

332
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:34,416
I told you to wait. I don't know
how many more ways I could say it.

333
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,543
Yeah, dick, I was waiting...

334
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:39,463
And then that creepy, quiet guy
showed up.

335
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:42,382
- Gus came by?
- Not him, man.

336
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:44,885
Apparently
I'm not worthy of meeting him.

337
00:30:45,052 --> 00:30:47,721
The other one.
The one I'm qualified to speak to.

338
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:49,431
He started asking questions too.

339
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:53,602
Like why haven't we cooked anything.
All right, we have a quota.

340
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:57,397
It's due tomorrow.
Do you seriously not care or what?

341
00:30:57,564 --> 00:31:00,442
Because that guy,
he's got, like, the dead eyes.

342
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:01,902
Let me ask you something.

343
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:04,780
Do you remember when we were
out in the desert with tuco?

344
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:08,241
Oh, you mean when he put
a machine gun to my head?

345
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:11,203
Yeah, I think that does ring a tiny bell.
Why?

346
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,872
No. He kept... he kept saying...

347
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:17,709
That someone was coming up
from Mexico to get us.

348
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,420
Do you remember?
Now, who was that?

349
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:24,925
What the hell has this got to do with...?
Look, I don't know. It was...

350
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:29,763
His cousins.

351
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:33,225
Right, Jesse? It was...
It was his cousins.

352
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:35,936
Yeah, cousins.

353
00:31:36,103 --> 00:31:37,646
Whatever, man. Why?

354
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:58,250
Any news?

355
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:00,252
No change.

356
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:08,093
Okay, well, I didn't know
whose toothbrushes were whose...

357
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:11,263
So I just stopped by the drugstore.

358
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:13,807
Thank god for travel sizes, right?

359
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:15,475
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

360
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:25,360
Oh, I think I'm gonna
go wash my face.

361
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:27,612
I'm going crazy.

362
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:31,658
- Do you wanna come?
- Yeah.

363
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:41,501
Nurse Franklin,
please page the operator.

364
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:44,212
Nurse Franklin, page the operator.

365
00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:50,218
I got candy bars.

366
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:56,558
Is this what you were asking for?

367
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:58,810
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

368
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:02,230
Yeah, I skimmed through it.

369
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:04,816
- Looks interesting.
- Yeah.

370
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,153
Uncle Hank gave it to me.

371
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:14,326
Well, what's it about?

372
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:21,833
Pablo Escobar,
this big drug guy in the '803.

373
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:25,045
Yeah. Yeah.
I remember seeing him on the news.

374
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:30,217
Well, it's more about the guys
who investigated him...

375
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:32,886
And tried to bring him down.

376
00:33:33,053 --> 00:33:36,056
Some of them were DEA, you know?

377
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:41,394
Uncle Hank said
that they were worth learning about...

378
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:44,689
That everybody knows
who Pablo Escobar is...

379
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:48,568
But nobody knows about the guys
that brought him down.

380
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:52,656
I guess I never thought about it.

381
00:33:55,659 --> 00:34:02,749
He said that good guys never get ink
like the bad guys do.

382
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:13,760
So he gave it to me.

383
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:16,596
Figured I'd read it.

384
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:32,571
I need to...

385
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,739
- I'll be right back, okay?
- Okay.

386
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:45,917
No, I assure you.
We are hard at work. Absolutely.

387
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:49,754
So I can expect delivery by tomorrow
as scheduled.

388
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:51,965
Well...

389
00:34:52,716 --> 00:34:54,467
Unfortunately...

390
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:56,344
Unfortunately...

391
00:34:56,511 --> 00:35:00,682
We're not going to be able
to keep our schedule this week.

392
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:03,101
But not for lack of trying.

393
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:05,312
Is there something I should know?

394
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:09,316
Well, to be completely honest
with you...

395
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:12,652
Gale really screwed us up.

396
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:16,823
I mean, not on purpose, of course,
but he just... he set us way back.

397
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:19,784
And we've been playing catch-up
ever since.

398
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:25,332
And I've had to be out
running errands...

399
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:27,834
And trying to keep us on target.

400
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:32,339
Some of the equipment
wasn't calibrated correctly...

401
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:35,508
Well, it's just all very technical
and boring.

402
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:38,803
But rest assured that...

403
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,264
That we will do whatever it takes.

404
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,683
It has my total attention.

405
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:46,061
We 'i/ cook through the weekend
if necessary.

406
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:51,274
We will have 400 pounds for you
by next week.

407
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:56,529
I have your word on that?

408
00:35:56,696 --> 00:36:00,200
You do. You have my word on that.

409
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:03,870
Thank you for the update.

410
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:28,228
Yeah. Right.

411
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:32,107
Any news?

412
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:36,236
No, I'm just wandering.

413
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:41,741
- How's everybody doing?
- Well, as well as can be expected.

414
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:44,953
It's this not knowing...

415
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,580
That's the hardest part, I think.

416
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:51,418
Anything new on these guys?

417
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,586
Who they are? What they wanted?

418
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:57,632
No, nothing yet, but we'll get it.

419
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:03,596
Steve...

420
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:08,435
Do you think
there could maybe be others?

421
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:12,605
Buddy, nobody's getting to Hank.

422
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:15,108
That was their one shot
and they blew it.

423
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:17,610
So no.

424
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,155
No way.

425
00:37:21,448 --> 00:37:22,949
Jesus.

426
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:26,661
I'd love to walk in there and shoot
that bastard right in the head.

427
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:28,455
Me too.

428
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,423
Yeah?

429
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:40,175
Oh, yeah?

430
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:42,927
Great. We'll be right down.

431
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,345
Food's here.

432
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,473
Hey, you like pollos hermanos?

433
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:49,267
- You guys coming?
- Yeah.

434
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:53,104
- On occasion, yeah.
- Owner's a big booster for the DEA.

435
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:56,608
He heard what happened. He's gonna
feed every cop in the building.

436
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:00,361
- That's wonderful.
- Yeah.

437
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:03,490
And, apparently,
he's bringing it by personally.

438
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:15,001
- I don't even know what to say.
- That's an incredible...

439
00:38:15,168 --> 00:38:17,837
- Good, huh?
- Delicious.

440
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:20,965
That's so generous of you.
Thank you very much.

441
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,510
Yes, thank you.
Guys, did you hear that?

442
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:26,346
Mr. Fring is offering
a 10,000-dollar reward...

443
00:38:26,513 --> 00:38:28,556
On any information about the case.

444
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:32,519
Well, that's... that's wonderful.

445
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:34,687
Wow, thank you, Mr. Fring.

446
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:37,524
You're very welcome.
Men like your husband...

447
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:40,527
Are the thin blue line
between us and these animals.

448
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:42,028
I only wish I could do more.

449
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,828
Well, we do appreciate your support.

450
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:54,457
This reward could turn the tide here.
It'll really help.

451
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:58,545
Again,
I can't express how sorry I am.

452
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:01,005
As it happens,
I actually met agent schrader.

453
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:06,219
- Really?
- Our fund run, couple of months ago.

454
00:39:06,386 --> 00:39:09,389
Mr. Fring was one of our sponsors.

455
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:13,101
I talked for a few minutes
with your husband.

456
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:18,231
As a matter of fact,
Mr. White, your name came up.

457
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:21,860
Really?

458
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:26,531
Yeah, there happened to be
a collection jar out for you...

459
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:29,450
And we spoke briefly
about your health concerns.

460
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:32,704
I hope that there's been good news.

461
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:37,750
Things have improved, yes.

462
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:40,128
That's wonderful to hear.

463
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:43,715
It was clear to me
how deeply he cares for you.

464
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:49,929
Well, I have taken up
enough of your time.

465
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,810
Thank you again very much.
It was a great pleasure to meet you.

466
00:39:56,019 --> 00:39:58,062
- Thank you.
- Yes, thank you.

467
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:03,443
- Let me walk you out.
- Oh, no, it's not necessary.

468
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:06,946
It's amazing.

469
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:12,118
You know, I didn't say thank you.

470
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:15,163
I'll walk him out. Be right back.

471
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:20,793
Good to see you.
Enjoy the chicken?

472
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,630
- Good. Good.
- Excuse me.

473
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:27,175
My pleasure. My pleasure.

474
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:28,927
Thank you. Thank you.

475
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,970
- It's good chicken, huh? Good.
- Yeah.

476
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:33,306
- Mr. Fring.
- Mr. White.

477
00:40:33,473 --> 00:40:36,809
- I just wanted to thank you again.
- It's my pleasure.

478
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:41,064
May I...? May I speak with you?
Just a moment.

479
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,153
You knew.

480
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:50,990
You knew my brother-in-law
was with the DEA.

481
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:54,369
I investigate everyone
with whom I do business.

482
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:57,163
What careful man wouldn't?

483
00:40:57,705 --> 00:41:02,293
He is not a problem for us,
for our business.

484
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,508
Your being here is...

485
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:12,011
Is this some sort of message?

486
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:14,514
I'm supporting my community.

487
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:17,392
I hide in plain sight, same as you.

488
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,352
- Are we done?
- No, listen, I...

489
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:22,897
This attack on my brother-in-law,
I don't understand it.

490
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:25,024
I don't know what it means.

491
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:29,320
Please,
if you have some knowledge...

492
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,698
That you could share with me...

493
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,538
I fear for my family.

494
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:40,123
I'm sure they'll be fine.

495
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:44,043
I am told the assassin that survived
is gravely injured.

496
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,379
It's doubtful he'll live.

497
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:52,552
Now thank me and shake my hand.

498
00:41:56,639 --> 00:42:00,893
- Thank you. Thank you again.
- You're quite welcome, Mr. White.

499
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:05,231
Did you hear that?

500
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:11,571
- We're going up?
- Come on.

501
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:13,698
What's going on?

502
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:16,242
What's happening?

503
00:42:16,576 --> 00:42:20,079
Starting chest compressions.
One, two, three, four.

504
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,081
- One, two, three...
- Defib?

505
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:25,168
Patient is in asystole.
Continuing chest compressions.

506
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,253
One, two, three, four.

507
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,797
- Give me a liter of saline.
- I can't get a pulse.

508
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,549
One, two, three, four.

509
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:34,927
- Still nothing.
- All right, stopping compressions.

510
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:37,388
- Time?
- Eight forty-three.

511
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,599
Time of death, 20:43.

512
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:44,771
Burn in hell, you piece of shit.

513
00:43:12,632 --> 00:43:14,342
I assume you heard the news.

514
00:43:14,509 --> 00:43:17,178
Your man died. I heard.

515
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:19,972
- It's unfortunate.
- Yeah, unfortunate.

516
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:22,975
And meanwhile, I have federales
surrounding my house.

517
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:26,854
You know what I think, Gustavo?
I think you're behind all this.

518
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,315
Why would I do this?

519
00:43:29,482 --> 00:43:32,693
- How would it serve me?
- That's the part I'm trying to figure out.

520
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:35,029
Go off on your own, maybe.

521
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:37,198
Would you actually think
that would work?

522
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:40,159
Juan, you sound like
you're under a lot of stress.

523
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:43,329
You should call me back when
you're seeing things more clearly.

524
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:45,123
I see things clear enough.

525
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:48,835
One DEA gets shot,
all of Washington starts barking.

526
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:51,170
D.f. Suddenly has to put
on a big show...

527
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:54,048
And I wind up with federales
in my rosebushes.

528
00:43:54,257 --> 00:43:55,967
But just for a while.

529
00:43:56,300 --> 00:44:00,179
Appearances, politics.

530
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:02,348
Are you still there, Gustavo?

531
00:44:04,517 --> 00:44:05,643
I'm here.

532
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,354
I'll weather this. I always do.

533
00:44:08,521 --> 00:44:10,022
My brother's a police chief.

534
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:12,859
I got connections.
They'll get me through.

535
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:15,194
And when I get proof...

536
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:18,197
And the others find out
what you've done...

537
00:44:18,698 --> 00:44:21,409
Maybe we come pay you a visit.

538
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:23,411
Maybe we can...

539
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:15,254
Skyler. Skyler. Marie. Marie.

540
00:45:15,755 --> 00:45:18,216
Oh, how is he?
Tell me something good.

541
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:21,761
I think he's stable enough now
for you to go see him briefly.

542
00:45:21,928 --> 00:45:24,388
I'm sorry,
I'm afraid it's immediate family only.

543
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:26,557
- We're all family.
- I understand.

544
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:29,727
But we have a certain protocol here
that we need...

545
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:32,355
We're all family.
