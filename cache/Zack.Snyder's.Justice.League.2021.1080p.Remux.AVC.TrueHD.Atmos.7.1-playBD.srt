1
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:09,620
Alert the queen.

2
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:30,599
Hyah!

3
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:03,168
Bruce Vayne.

4
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:04,962
Bruce Wayne.

5
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,398
Talk.

6
00:09:25,733 --> 00:09:27,526
| believe there is a stranger.

7
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:30,237
Comes to this village
from the sea.

8
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:33,157
He comes in the winter
when the people are hungry.

9
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:35,534
He brings fish.

10
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:37,327
He comes on the king tide.

11
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:38,746
That was last night.

12
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:47,588
You have eyes, so see.

13
00:09:47,755 --> 00:09:49,506
Icebergs in the harbor.

14
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:51,675
It's four months since
the last ship got through.

15
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:56,889
Well, this stranger
doesn't come by ship.

16
00:10:03,854 --> 00:10:07,483
There are enemies
coming from far away.

17
00:10:08,776 --> 00:10:10,444
| need warriors.

18
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:14,156
This stranger, others like him.

19
00:10:14,323 --> 00:10:17,826
I'm building an alliance
to defend ourselves.

20
00:10:18,744 --> 00:10:21,663
It's very important
that I see this man.

21
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:25,125
If this stranger exists,

22
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,377
he'll give him your message.

23
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:28,754
$5,000 American.

24
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:30,756
Look, I'll give you $25,000

25
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,383
to talk to this man
right now, outside.

26
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:50,108
How dare this dog
speak to us like children.

27
00:10:50,943 --> 00:10:54,571
Ooh, magical man from the sea.

28
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:57,449
We are poor, not stupid.

29
00:10:57,741 --> 00:10:59,451
Get out.

30
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:01,829
I'm sorry.

31
00:11:02,246 --> 00:11:03,789
Can't do that.

32
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:06,166
I'll leave after we've spoken.

33
00:11:10,963 --> 00:11:14,132
-He said, "Get out."

34
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,277
Arthur Curry.

35
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:36,196
Also known as
Protector of the Oceans.

36
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:38,532
The Aquaman.

37
00:11:44,246 --> 00:11:45,956
So, let me get this straight.

38
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:49,626
You do it dressed like a bat?
Like an actual bat?

39
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:51,461
Worked for 20 years in Gotham.

40
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:53,463
Oh, that shithole.

41
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,424
When the fight comes,
we'll need you.

42
00:11:55,591 --> 00:11:57,342
-Don't count on it, Batman.
-Why not?

43
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,095
"Cause I don't like you coming
here, digging into my business

44
00:12:00,262 --> 00:12:02,806
and getting into my life.
| want to be left alone.

45
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:03,974
Is that why you do this?

46
00:12:04,141 --> 00:12:06,226
Why you help these people out
here in the middle of nowhere?

47
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:07,394
I've read the stories.

48
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,855
Your good deeds
you think no one sees.

49
00:12:10,022 --> 00:12:11,481
You'll join us.

50
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:13,358
"Strong man
is strongest alone."

51
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:14,776
You ever heard that?

52
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:16,612
You ever hear of Superman?

53
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:18,322
He died fighting next to me.

54
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:21,074
My point exactly.

55
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,452
He believed we were stronger together.

56
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:24,661
We owe it to him.

57
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:27,539
| don't owe anyone anything.

58
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:37,090
Dressed like a bat.

59
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:39,801
You're out of your mind, Bruce Wayne.

60
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:09,558
Move over, Dusty.

61
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:08,533
My God, Master Wayne,
but this is cold.

62
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:13,038
Maybe we can catch
the next king tide in Jamaica?

63
00:15:13,205 --> 00:15:15,457
Might be a metahuman or two in Fiji.

64
00:15:15,624 --> 00:15:17,250
Costa Rica's nice.

65
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:18,835
| found him.

66
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:23,173
He said no.

67
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:26,259
So the draft stands at naught for two?

68
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,473
Maybe a man who broods
in a cave for a living

69
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:35,143
isn't cut out to be a recruiter. Hmm?

70
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,581
That's $10, please.

71
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:05,715
Let us go now

72
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:12,430
My darling companion

73
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:25,068
Set out for the

74
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:32,367
Distant skies...

75
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:35,829
Good morning, Miss Lane.

76
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:37,205
Jerry, hi.

77
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:39,291
Wow.

78
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,376
You don't miss a day, do you?

79
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:44,796
Like it here.

80
00:16:50,886 --> 00:16:56,308
They told us our gods would outlive us

81
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:04,024
They told us our dreams would outlive us

82
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:12,532
They told us our gods would outlive us

83
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:20,707
But they lied

84
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:31,361
- Excuse me.

85
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:34,114
- Move!

86
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:46,293
Move it! Move it!

87
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,676
- No, mate, don't shoot!
-Move, move!

88
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:56,845
Get the fuck over there!

89
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:00,390
Move! All of ya!

90
00:19:11,026 --> 00:19:12,986
Line them up along the wall.

91
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:14,696
Keep them quiet.

92
00:19:16,031 --> 00:19:18,325
- Keep quiet!
- Shut up! Shut up!

93
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:19,868
Shut them up too!

94
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:25,498
We'll be making
a statement shortly.

95
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,500
Until then,
if I see any movement,

96
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,627
you'll have a lot of dead kids
on your hands.

97
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,227
Should I take him?

98
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:47,979
Hold your fire.

99
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:50,607
They've got kids in there.

100
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:54,319
Yeah, he's not bluffing, chief.

101
00:19:54,486 --> 00:19:56,404
St. Brigid's had a school trip today.

102
00:20:20,804 --> 00:20:22,597
Quiet! Shut up!

103
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:29,979
Down with the modern world.

104
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:31,689
Back to the Dark Ages.

105
00:20:37,112 --> 00:20:38,196
Quiet!

106
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:42,826
| said shut your fucking mouth.

107
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:58,675
-Who are you?

108
00:20:58,842 --> 00:21:01,678
The Lasso of Hestia compels
you to reveal the truth.

109
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:03,972
Now, who are you?

110
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:07,600
We're a small group
of reactionary terrorists

111
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,394
who wanna turn back
the clock in Europe

112
00:21:09,561 --> 00:21:11,813
-a thousand years.
-Boring. Why the hostages?

113
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,565
We have no demands.

114
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:15,191
We're just stalling the police
while we do it.

115
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:16,776
While you do what?

116
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:21,156
You're too late.
The countdown's already begun.

117
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:25,410
In a few minutes, four city blocks...

118
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:28,997
...while the world watches.

119
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:09,639
No!

120
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,766
Like lambs to the slaughter.

121
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,233
I don't believe it.

122
00:24:02,692 --> 00:24:03,693
Believe it.

123
00:24:39,354 --> 00:24:42,106
Is everyone all right?
Are you okay?

124
00:24:42,357 --> 00:24:44,359
Good. It's okay.

125
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:46,778
It's okay. It's over.
You can stand up.

126
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:48,029
It's all good.

127
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:49,822
It's over now. Are you okay?

128
00:24:50,365 --> 00:24:52,492
You okay? Good.

129
00:24:58,164 --> 00:24:59,457
Are you okay, princess?

130
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:04,712
Can I be like you someday?

131
00:25:06,881 --> 00:25:09,467
You can be anything you want to be.

132
00:25:11,386 --> 00:25:13,763
Come on. Let's go.

133
00:25:56,556 --> 00:25:57,765
Any changes today?

134
00:25:57,932 --> 00:25:59,392
No, my Queen.

135
00:26:01,102 --> 00:26:02,729
The Mother Box has awoken,

136
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:05,064
yet nothing has happened.

137
00:26:06,274 --> 00:26:08,317
It has slept for thousands of years

138
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:10,445
since the First Age.

139
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:11,946
Why did it wake at all?

140
00:26:19,829 --> 00:26:21,706
This is the first time it's gone quiet

141
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:22,999
since the crack appeared.

142
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:25,835
Maybe it's going back to sleep.

143
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:31,632
Evil does not sleep.

144
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:33,968
It waits.

145
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,930
Something is coming.

146
00:26:43,186 --> 00:26:44,645
Prepare for battle!

147
00:27:10,338 --> 00:27:12,548
Amazons, on your marks!

148
00:27:12,924 --> 00:27:14,217
Ready!

149
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:41,452
Defenders.

150
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,375
They have failed 100,000 worlds.

151
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:49,377
They always fail.

152
00:27:51,337 --> 00:27:56,008
I've come to enlighten you
to the great darkness.

153
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:59,095
| will bathe in your fear.

154
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:03,057
Daughters of Themyscira,

155
00:28:04,392 --> 00:28:05,977
show him your fear!

156
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:08,563
We have no fear!

157
00:28:27,832 --> 00:28:29,458
Gather the legions!

158
00:28:30,376 --> 00:28:31,544
Go with her!

159
00:28:31,711 --> 00:28:32,795
You must seal the cage!

160
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:35,423
-Go!
-Phillipus!

161
00:29:02,158 --> 00:29:03,242
No!

162
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,964
Behind you!

163
00:29:20,885 --> 00:29:22,386
Ahhh!

164
00:29:24,347 --> 00:29:25,514
Epione.

165
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:29,518
Honor us. It's right.

166
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,814
Seal it.

167
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:41,656
Ready the hammers!

168
00:29:53,918 --> 00:29:55,711
Seal it now!

169
00:31:30,431 --> 00:31:32,099
Guard it with your life.

170
00:31:32,266 --> 00:31:34,018
-Yes, my Queen.
- Keep it moving.

171
00:31:34,101 --> 00:31:35,478
Hyah! Hyah!

172
00:32:58,853 --> 00:33:00,604
- Hyah!

173
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,644
Got it! Go!

174
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:23,896
Hyah!

175
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:48,754
Oh, noble Queen.
Why do you fight?

176
00:34:51,799 --> 00:34:53,550
You can't save her.

177
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:56,178
You can't save any of them.

178
00:34:59,682 --> 00:35:03,102
The great darkness begins.

179
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:05,229
Amazons!

180
00:35:15,823 --> 00:35:18,492
Yes, we will find the others.

181
00:35:20,369 --> 00:35:22,871
-Draw!

182
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,500
Loose!

183
00:36:24,266 --> 00:36:26,268
He's gone back to his universe.

184
00:36:26,352 --> 00:36:27,353
No.

185
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:32,316
He's gone to the lands of men

186
00:36:32,483 --> 00:36:34,610
to find the other two boxes.

187
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:38,155
We have to light
the ancient warning fire.

188
00:36:39,031 --> 00:36:42,493
The fire has not burned
for 5,000 years.

189
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:44,203
Men won't know what it means.

190
00:36:45,037 --> 00:36:46,413
Men won't.

191
00:36:48,165 --> 00:36:49,583
She will.

192
00:37:20,322 --> 00:37:22,950
It's toxic.

193
00:37:23,117 --> 00:37:24,827
That's good.

194
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:46,974
Go!

195
00:37:47,141 --> 00:37:49,143
Follow the scent of the Mother Boxes.

196
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:50,853
Find the missing two.

197
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:54,898
Once they are found,
The Unity will be formed.

198
00:37:55,065 --> 00:37:57,818
This world will join the others.

199
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:01,738
He will be pleased.

200
00:38:01,905 --> 00:38:04,825
He will see my worth again.

201
00:38:07,494 --> 00:38:08,620
Hey.

202
00:38:09,413 --> 00:38:11,999
Anything on that kid
from the liquor store?

203
00:38:12,166 --> 00:38:13,584
Possibly.

204
00:38:14,376 --> 00:38:15,544
"Possibly."

205
00:38:16,753 --> 00:38:19,298
If I had a dollar for every "possibly."

206
00:38:19,465 --> 00:38:22,092
Yeah, it would make you
even more insufferable.

207
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:27,764
Facial scan might have
got a hit on him,

208
00:38:27,931 --> 00:38:29,766
our disappearing man.

209
00:38:30,392 --> 00:38:35,105
One Mr. Barry Allen from Central City.

210
00:38:35,272 --> 00:38:36,690
Might be another false positive,

211
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:38,150
you'll have to give me
a little time

212
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:40,569
-to confirm.
-We don't have any more time.

213
00:38:42,279 --> 00:38:44,031
Master Wayne,

214
00:38:44,198 --> 00:38:46,533
you've been working
as if there's no tomorrow

215
00:38:46,617 --> 00:38:47,701
to build this team

216
00:38:47,868 --> 00:38:49,703
of people you can't even find.

217
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,955
| found one.
| found two, including Diana.

218
00:38:52,039 --> 00:38:54,249
Just because Lex Luthor says

219
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:56,126
the planet's in danger of attack?

220
00:38:56,293 --> 00:38:58,295
This has nothing to do with Lex Luthor.

221
00:38:58,462 --> 00:38:59,671
It has to do with him.

222
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:03,258
| made a promise to him on his grave.

223
00:39:04,134 --> 00:39:07,262
| spent a lot of time
trying to divide us.

224
00:39:07,429 --> 00:39:10,224
| need to bring us together
and make this right.

225
00:39:11,016 --> 00:39:13,602
Well, it's been some time
since Luthor's warning.

226
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:16,980
No attacks.
No barbarians at the gate.

227
00:39:18,232 --> 00:39:20,859
Maybe these barbarians don't use a gate.

228
00:39:21,735 --> 00:39:23,403
Maybe they're already here.

229
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:29,159
Keep looking. What else do you have?

230
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:09,700
Lab's all yours, Howard.

231
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:11,451
11:30.

232
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:12,953
Early night for you, Silas.

233
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,205
Yes, early night.

234
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:16,999
Tell your family I said hello.

235
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:53,952
What the...

236
00:40:57,873 --> 00:40:59,041
Jesus.

237
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,116
The Arrow of Artemis.

238
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,744
It will reach the lands of men.

239
00:42:27,379 --> 00:42:28,672
Sky torch,

240
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:30,382
hero beacon,

241
00:42:30,549 --> 00:42:32,259
scatter the darkness.

242
00:42:32,426 --> 00:42:35,679
Burn as you burned in days before.

243
00:42:37,264 --> 00:42:40,726
Show her the darkness before
the daylight of history.

244
00:42:41,226 --> 00:42:44,813
Warn my daughter that war has come

245
00:42:46,189 --> 00:42:47,899
and protect her.

246
00:43:12,632 --> 00:43:14,926
Return to me, Diana.

247
00:43:53,548 --> 00:43:56,176
What did you do
this weekend, Diana?

248
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:58,845
Nothing very interesting.

249
00:43:58,929 --> 00:44:01,515
That's all you ever tell us.

250
00:44:01,598 --> 00:44:05,060
What can I do?
I'm not that exciting.

251
00:44:05,227 --> 00:44:08,688
You might as well disappear
when you walk out of here.

252
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:14,569
Again?

253
00:44:14,736 --> 00:44:16,613
-What is it?
-Now what?

254
00:44:16,988 --> 00:44:20,116
Budget cuts, tomb raiders.

255
00:44:20,283 --> 00:44:22,786
Now add to the list "arson."

256
00:44:24,663 --> 00:44:25,789
Yes, good morning

257
00:44:25,872 --> 00:44:27,290
-from the isle of Crete.

258
00:44:27,457 --> 00:44:29,167
As you can see behind me,

259
00:44:29,251 --> 00:44:32,003
an enormous bonfire is burning.

260
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:34,297
This fire has been burning
through the night.

261
00:44:34,464 --> 00:44:35,757
We're now into the morning

262
00:44:35,841 --> 00:44:38,260
and we are at least five miles away.

263
00:44:38,426 --> 00:44:41,763
And we can still
see it burning as we speak.

264
00:44:41,888 --> 00:44:44,933
This has baffled locals
and government authorities alike

265
00:44:45,141 --> 00:44:47,018
here at this historical site

266
00:44:47,102 --> 00:44:49,646
of the so-called shrine of the Amazons.

267
00:44:49,813 --> 00:44:51,648
Now, locals and government
officials are baffled as to

268
00:44:51,731 --> 00:44:53,775
-what may have caused this.
-Invasion.

269
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:03,952
Ryan.

270
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:05,495
-Hiya, Doc.
- Is the...

271
00:45:05,662 --> 00:45:07,497
No damage to the electron-laser.

272
00:45:07,789 --> 00:45:09,833
-Uh, Dr. Silas Stone?
-Yeah.

273
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,084
-Ryan Choi?
- That's us.

274
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:14,296
Um, who did this?
Did they steal anything?

275
00:45:14,379 --> 00:45:16,047
They took whatever was in here.

276
00:45:16,131 --> 00:45:19,092
That? Oh, that wasn't stolen.
Was it, Dr. Stone?

277
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:22,387
No. That was misplaced a while ago.

278
00:45:22,971 --> 00:45:26,808
Object 6-1-9-8-2.
Department of Defense Archives.

279
00:45:26,892 --> 00:45:28,768
- Mmm-hmm.
-What was it?

280
00:45:29,185 --> 00:45:30,186
| don't know.

281
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:31,271
You don't know?

282
00:45:31,354 --> 00:45:33,607
| don't know,
which was why I was studying it.

283
00:45:33,773 --> 00:45:35,275
What's your rank, Doctor?

284
00:45:35,692 --> 00:45:37,694
Ryan, would you, uh, do the honors?

285
00:45:37,861 --> 00:45:39,529
-Sure. Okay.
-Thanks.

286
00:45:39,613 --> 00:45:42,032
Civilian. STARLABS
is a private contractor.

287
00:45:42,115 --> 00:45:43,241
We work for the DoD.

288
00:45:43,408 --> 00:45:45,994
We advise them on xeno-science.

289
00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:47,370
"“Keno-science"?

290
00:45:48,038 --> 00:45:49,873
Alien technology.

291
00:45:56,963 --> 00:45:59,049
For example,

292
00:45:59,215 --> 00:46:00,759
the Superman ship.

293
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,101
Eight people

294
00:46:10,185 --> 00:46:11,978
never signed out
of the lab last night, Doctor.

295
00:46:12,354 --> 00:46:13,605
Cleaning staff, guards,

296
00:46:13,688 --> 00:46:15,398
a few of your research scientists.

297
00:46:15,774 --> 00:46:16,775
They were abducted.

298
00:46:18,151 --> 00:46:19,152
Are you sure?

299
00:46:19,319 --> 00:46:21,863
Witness saw it all. He escaped.

300
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:25,158
He's here in quarantine now,
working on an ID sketch.

301
00:46:28,161 --> 00:46:32,499
Any idea who or what that might be?

302
00:46:52,644 --> 00:46:54,688
The box isn't safe here.

303
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:58,650
Victor,

304
00:46:58,858 --> 00:47:01,111
they came looking for it at the lab.

305
00:47:01,277 --> 00:47:05,699
People were taken by
some kind of monster or something.

306
00:47:08,451 --> 00:47:10,412
You know a lot about monsters,

307
00:47:11,037 --> 00:47:12,455
don't you?

308
00:47:18,837 --> 00:47:20,964
Especially how to make 'em.

309
00:50:21,561 --> 00:50:25,190
Mayday! Mayday, mayday!

310
00:50:25,982 --> 00:50:29,068
My hull is breached. I'm going down.

311
00:50:35,408 --> 00:50:37,368
Mayday!

312
00:50:37,577 --> 00:50:39,621
Is there anybody out there?

313
00:50:45,001 --> 00:50:46,044
Ahh!

314
00:51:19,953 --> 00:51:21,246
Whiskey.

315
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:32,966
Tell him to respect the storm next time.

316
00:51:42,141 --> 00:51:43,142
It's on him.

317
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:09,210
The starry heavens above me

318
00:52:12,046 --> 00:52:15,216
The moral law within

319
00:52:18,511 --> 00:52:21,347
So the world appears

320
00:52:24,267 --> 00:52:28,730
Through this mist of tears

321
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:36,237
There is a kingdom
There is a king

322
00:52:36,738 --> 00:52:42,493
And he lives without
And he lives within

323
00:52:43,369 --> 00:52:48,374
There is a kingdom
There is a king

324
00:52:48,958 --> 00:52:55,173
There is a king
And he is everything

325
00:54:11,374 --> 00:54:13,459
King who would be man.

326
00:54:13,626 --> 00:54:16,796
Son of a human father
and Queen of the Seas.

327
00:54:17,672 --> 00:54:19,424
All the time I've wasted

328
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:22,635
trying to keep the promise
| made to your mother.

329
00:54:24,762 --> 00:54:25,972
Are you finished, old man?

330
00:54:26,139 --> 00:54:28,599
You never sleep
in the same place twice,

331
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:31,519
yet you keep coming back here.

332
00:54:33,479 --> 00:54:35,440
| like it. It's quiet.

333
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:37,400
It's your inheritance.

334
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:39,694
You're the rightful king of Atlantis.

335
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:41,946
Our people suffer.

336
00:54:42,113 --> 00:54:44,073
Your people.

337
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:47,785
A brutal, petty, superstitious race.

338
00:54:47,952 --> 00:54:49,162
Is the surface any different?

339
00:54:50,288 --> 00:54:52,290
Nobody calls me King of the Surface.

340
00:54:53,374 --> 00:54:55,084
What do you want, Vulko?

341
00:54:55,668 --> 00:54:57,003
Guards near the stronghold

342
00:54:57,086 --> 00:54:58,546
have been disappearing.

343
00:54:58,713 --> 00:55:00,131
Snatchers from above.

344
00:55:00,298 --> 00:55:01,507
Talk to King Orm.

345
00:55:01,674 --> 00:55:03,092
- Your brother?
-Half-brother.

346
00:55:03,259 --> 00:55:06,262
He's trying to fan the flames
of war with the surface.

347
00:55:06,637 --> 00:55:08,055
He lies.

348
00:55:09,515 --> 00:55:11,642
The snatchers have come
from the dark place.

349
00:55:11,726 --> 00:55:13,519
They're looking for it.

350
00:55:14,353 --> 00:55:17,690
The Mother Box
our people guard is not safe.

351
00:55:18,691 --> 00:55:21,110
Go to the stronghold of Atlantis.

352
00:55:21,194 --> 00:55:22,695
Protect the box.

353
00:55:23,696 --> 00:55:24,906
The time has come.

354
00:55:27,033 --> 00:55:29,035
Take up your mother's trident.

355
00:55:40,213 --> 00:55:43,883
You can't turn your back
on the world forever, Arthur.

356
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:47,845
Above or below.

357
00:56:16,999 --> 00:56:18,584
DeSaad.

358
00:56:18,751 --> 00:56:22,713
DeSaad! I call to thee.

359
00:56:31,764 --> 00:56:35,935
Steppenwolf,
have you begun the conquest?

360
00:56:37,061 --> 00:56:39,438
This world is divided.

361
00:56:40,231 --> 00:56:41,732
They are a primitive species.

362
00:56:41,899 --> 00:56:44,235
Unevolved and at war with one another.

363
00:56:44,402 --> 00:56:47,238
Too separate to be one.

364
00:56:47,405 --> 00:56:49,740
Their free will
must be ripped from them,

365
00:56:49,824 --> 00:56:51,659
like the other worlds.

366
00:56:51,826 --> 00:56:55,955
Given absolution in one glorious belief,

367
00:56:56,122 --> 00:56:57,832
to serve him.

368
00:56:58,624 --> 00:57:00,543
The Mother Boxes?

369
00:57:01,127 --> 00:57:04,046
| have found one of the three.

370
00:57:04,213 --> 00:57:06,674
The one that woke and called to me.

371
00:57:06,841 --> 00:57:08,342
The other two still sleep,

372
00:57:08,509 --> 00:57:12,346
but the parademons feel their presence.

373
00:57:12,513 --> 00:57:13,973
They fly,

374
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:17,727
they search, they take prisoners
who carry the scent,

375
00:57:17,893 --> 00:57:22,815
while I build a stronghold
in the name of his glory.

376
00:57:23,357 --> 00:57:25,234
Yes.

377
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:28,988
Mighty Steppenwolf,

378
00:57:30,489 --> 00:57:34,869
who might have sat here
by the side of the great one.

379
00:57:36,787 --> 00:57:41,375
But undone by his self-pride.

380
00:57:42,543 --> 00:57:43,919
DeSaad...

381
00:57:45,004 --> 00:57:47,381
| fall before you.

382
00:57:48,132 --> 00:57:49,925
Let me make a plea to him

383
00:57:50,092 --> 00:57:52,011
that I may come home

384
00:57:52,178 --> 00:57:54,972
after I take this world in his name.

385
00:57:55,139 --> 00:57:57,558
You betrayed him.

386
00:57:58,976 --> 00:58:00,478
Your own family.

387
00:58:00,645 --> 00:58:02,855
| saw my mistake.

388
00:58:03,022 --> 00:58:05,608
| slaughtered those
who sought his throne.

389
00:58:05,775 --> 00:58:10,905
You still owe the great one
50,000 more worlds.

390
00:58:11,989 --> 00:58:13,824
He will hear your plea

391
00:58:14,283 --> 00:58:16,535
when you pay your debt.

392
00:58:19,455 --> 00:58:22,500
The Mother Boxes
will be found and united.

393
00:58:23,459 --> 00:58:25,586
No protectors here.

394
00:58:25,753 --> 00:58:29,173
No Lanterns, no Kryptonian.

395
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:32,968
This world will fall,
like all the others.

396
00:58:34,011 --> 00:58:35,763
For Darkseid.

397
00:58:38,974 --> 00:58:41,185
For Darkseid.

398
00:59:02,456 --> 00:59:04,417
You know, I paid millions of dollars

399
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:06,043
for this building's security.

400
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:07,503
You got your money's worth.

401
00:59:08,003 --> 00:59:10,381
Took me almost a minute to disable it.

402
00:59:11,924 --> 00:59:13,259
Hi there.

403
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:15,928
A new toy?

404
00:59:16,846 --> 00:59:19,014
Prototype troop carrier.

405
00:59:20,683 --> 00:59:22,601
I once knew a man

406
00:59:22,685 --> 00:59:24,353
who would have loved to fly it.

407
00:59:24,979 --> 00:59:26,772
The best minds at Wayne Aerospace

408
00:59:26,856 --> 00:59:27,940
couldn't make it fly.

409
00:59:29,024 --> 00:59:30,609
But you can?

410
00:59:30,776 --> 00:59:32,445
| have no choice.

411
00:59:32,611 --> 00:59:35,364
| need more range
and I need more cargo.

412
00:59:35,531 --> 00:59:37,116
| think there's an attack coming.

413
00:59:37,533 --> 00:59:39,285
Not coming, Bruce.

414
00:59:40,077 --> 00:59:42,037
It's already here.

415
00:59:42,830 --> 00:59:44,707
From what I've learned,

416
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:47,376
they are things from another universe.

417
00:59:47,543 --> 00:59:49,879
They serve a dark power.

418
00:59:50,045 --> 00:59:51,756
An old power.

419
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:53,340
What do they want?

420
00:59:53,424 --> 00:59:56,510
To invade. To conquer.

421
00:59:57,636 --> 01:00:01,891
They came here once before, long ago.

422
01:00:07,021 --> 01:00:09,440
A great armada appeared in the sky,

423
01:00:09,607 --> 01:00:12,234
laying waste to all who opposed it.

424
01:00:12,401 --> 01:00:16,489
The leader of the invaders
was a being called Darkseid.

425
01:00:16,655 --> 01:00:20,910
A name cursed and feared
in every universe.

426
01:00:21,786 --> 01:00:25,623
Darkseid was met in battle
by Earth's defenders.

427
01:00:25,790 --> 01:00:28,292
The old gods, men...

428
01:00:28,876 --> 01:00:32,004
Allanteans before
their descent into the sea...

429
01:00:34,173 --> 01:00:38,135
Amazons before their betrayal
and enslavement

430
01:00:38,469 --> 01:00:40,846
and guardians from the stars.

431
01:00:41,013 --> 01:00:42,932
Their histories had taught them

432
01:00:43,015 --> 01:00:44,600
not to trust each other,

433
01:00:44,767 --> 01:00:46,936
not to hope for an alliance.

434
01:00:47,102 --> 01:00:49,104
To fight apart.

435
01:01:38,153 --> 01:01:40,865
As Darkseid waged war on Earth,

436
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:42,449
he found a secret there.

437
01:01:42,616 --> 01:01:46,370
A power hidden in the infinity of space.

438
01:01:46,537 --> 01:01:48,038
He called forth mystics

439
01:01:48,205 --> 01:01:51,333
who worshipped and controlled
three objects...

440
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:52,543
the Mother Boxes.

441
01:01:52,877 --> 01:01:54,295
Wait, wait, wait.

442
01:01:54,461 --> 01:01:55,462
"Mother Boxes"?

443
01:01:55,629 --> 01:01:58,173
Indestructible living machines,

444
01:01:58,883 --> 01:02:01,552
made from a science so advanced,

445
01:02:01,635 --> 01:02:03,804
it looks like sorcery.

446
01:02:03,971 --> 01:02:06,599
To conquer,
three boxes have to synchronize

447
01:02:06,765 --> 01:02:10,019
and join together into The Unity.

448
01:02:10,185 --> 01:02:13,230
The Unity cleanses a planet with fire,

449
01:02:13,397 --> 01:02:16,984
transforming it into a copy
of the enemy's world.

450
01:02:17,151 --> 01:02:20,654
All who live
become servants of Darkseid.

451
01:02:20,821 --> 01:02:23,741
Alive but drained of life.

452
01:02:23,949 --> 01:02:25,284
Parademons.

453
01:02:26,493 --> 01:02:28,579
-Amazons!

454
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:36,170
With me!

455
01:03:05,491 --> 01:03:07,993
But before The Unity
could synchronize,

456
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:10,204
the defenders of Earth attacked

457
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:11,538
and fought as one.

458
01:03:12,122 --> 01:03:15,125
Amazons alongside Atlanteans.

459
01:03:15,292 --> 01:03:17,002
Zeus and his son Ares

460
01:03:17,086 --> 01:03:19,797
alongside the guardians from the sky.

461
01:03:20,798 --> 01:03:23,968
A golden Age of Heroes fighting together

462
01:03:24,051 --> 01:03:25,469
to defend life on Earth.

463
01:05:22,127 --> 01:05:24,922
They did what no world
had ever done.

464
01:05:25,089 --> 01:05:27,257
Sent the enemies back into the stars.

465
01:05:29,802 --> 01:05:33,055
The three Mother Boxes
never synchronized.

466
01:05:33,639 --> 01:05:36,809
-The Unity never came to pass.

467
01:05:36,975 --> 01:05:39,186
But, in their retreat,

468
01:05:39,812 --> 01:05:42,940
the boxes were left behind on Earth.

469
01:05:43,107 --> 01:05:46,819
They grew weak.
Dogs without masters

470
01:05:48,654 --> 01:05:50,239
falling asleep,

471
01:05:50,405 --> 01:05:52,866
awaiting their return.

472
01:05:53,033 --> 01:05:55,369
Fading from the view of the enemy,

473
01:05:55,536 --> 01:05:58,705
anonymous among a trillion worlds.

474
01:06:15,597 --> 01:06:18,767
The defenders of Earth made a vow.

475
01:06:19,143 --> 01:06:22,396
Men, Atlanteans, and Amazons.

476
01:06:22,563 --> 01:06:24,398
Each would enshrine and guard

477
01:06:24,481 --> 01:06:26,441
one of the three sleeping Mother Boxes

478
01:06:26,608 --> 01:06:30,112
according to the rites
and rituals of their culture

479
01:06:30,279 --> 01:06:33,031
in case a box should ever wake again

480
01:06:33,115 --> 01:06:34,741
to call out to the planet Apokolips

481
01:06:34,908 --> 01:06:36,660
to return and conquer

482
01:06:36,827 --> 01:06:40,622
the only world Darkseid had ever lost.

483
01:07:56,573 --> 01:07:59,243
Something woke the box my people guard.

484
01:07:59,952 --> 01:08:01,995
It called out to the dark place...

485
01:08:02,162 --> 01:08:04,581
to one of Darkseid's conquerors.

486
01:08:05,499 --> 01:08:07,376
The enemy is here.

487
01:08:07,876 --> 01:08:09,544
If he's here, where is he?

488
01:08:09,711 --> 01:08:11,797
He'll be searching
for the other two boxes.

489
01:08:11,964 --> 01:08:14,925
Hiding until he has all three.
Until he's ready.

490
01:08:15,092 --> 01:08:18,929
Then we have to be ready.
You, me, the others.

491
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:22,516
They said the Age of Heroes
would never come again.

492
01:08:22,683 --> 01:08:23,934
No, it will.

493
01:08:24,268 --> 01:08:25,978
It has to.

494
01:08:27,729 --> 01:08:31,233
The others. Where are they?

495
01:08:53,255 --> 01:08:54,256
Am I late?

496
01:08:54,339 --> 01:08:56,842
No, I'm so late. I'm very late.

497
01:08:56,925 --> 01:08:58,385
Oh, hey, buddy. Hey.

498
01:08:58,677 --> 01:09:00,053
-Oh. No.

499
01:09:00,554 --> 01:09:02,723
- Okay, bye. Okay.

500
01:09:03,598 --> 01:09:05,517
-I'm so sorry.

501
01:09:05,934 --> 01:09:07,185
I'm late.

502
01:09:12,691 --> 01:09:13,734
-Are you, uh...
-I'm...

503
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:16,153
I'm so sorry I'm so late.
| didn't mean to be so late.

504
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:17,821
I'm me and I'm here
and I'm so sorry I'm late.

505
01:09:17,988 --> 01:09:19,072
Essentially, the bus didn't come,

506
01:09:19,156 --> 01:09:20,157
then the bus did come,

507
01:09:20,324 --> 01:09:21,491
but then there was this old woman

508
01:09:21,575 --> 01:09:22,617
counting change for the fare,

509
01:09:22,784 --> 01:09:23,910
like, nickel, penny, nickel, penny.

510
01:09:24,077 --> 01:09:25,829
Like, jeez Louise,
let this woman on the bus.

511
01:09:25,996 --> 01:09:26,997
She's 107 years old,

512
01:09:27,164 --> 01:09:28,832
these are some of her
last few moments of life.

513
01:09:28,999 --> 01:09:30,042
Résumé.

514
01:09:30,459 --> 01:09:31,501
Résumé.

515
01:09:34,755 --> 01:09:35,839
Come on.

516
01:09:39,176 --> 01:09:40,260
Come on.

517
01:09:40,427 --> 01:09:41,970
From the French, of course.

518
01:09:42,137 --> 01:09:45,182
> "Resume,” I believe,
IS a past participle of...

519
01:09:50,604 --> 01:09:52,105
Uh, wow. That's no good.

520
01:09:52,564 --> 01:09:54,191
It's like,
what lives in my pocket, right?

521
01:09:54,274 --> 01:09:56,860
"Paper monster hungry." Uh...

522
01:10:05,077 --> 01:10:07,746
Come on. Supposed to be friends now.

523
01:10:14,044 --> 01:10:15,337
-Yes.

524
01:10:24,346 --> 01:10:26,765
Central City College,
I'm a criminal justice major.

525
01:10:26,932 --> 01:10:28,058
You said you had experience

526
01:10:28,141 --> 01:10:29,184
walking dogs.

527
01:11:18,733 --> 01:11:20,402
Long afloat

528
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:25,782
On shipless oceans

529
01:11:27,075 --> 01:11:33,874
I did all my best to smile

530
01:11:35,709 --> 01:11:41,798
"Til your singing eyes and fingers

531
01:11:43,133 --> 01:11:49,723
Drew me loving into your eyes

532
01:11:51,266 --> 01:11:56,980
Then I dreamed, you dreamed about me

533
01:11:58,273 --> 01:12:04,613
Were you here when I was for sail?

534
01:12:05,572 --> 01:12:11,536
Now my foolish boat is leaning

535
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:19,044
Broken lovelorn on your rocks

536
01:12:20,921 --> 01:12:23,173
Here I am

537
01:12:24,049 --> 01:12:27,052
Here I am

538
01:12:29,304 --> 01:12:35,894
Waiting to hold you

539
01:13:09,636 --> 01:13:11,680
Oh, gosh, I hope everyone's okay.

540
01:13:11,846 --> 01:13:14,474
See, in times of crisis, for dog work,

541
01:13:14,558 --> 01:13:16,560
| always bring a meat snack.

542
01:13:16,726 --> 01:13:17,978
"Cause it makes them feel calm.

543
01:13:18,061 --> 01:13:19,145
'Cause you never know

544
01:13:19,229 --> 01:13:20,272
what's going to happen in this city.

545
01:13:20,355 --> 01:13:21,898
| mean, oh, my gosh.

546
01:13:22,065 --> 01:13:24,609
Right? I start on Monday?

547
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:05,609
You have been near a Mother Box.

548
01:14:06,818 --> 01:14:08,820
The scent is on you.

549
01:14:09,404 --> 01:14:10,655
Where is it?

550
01:14:11,072 --> 01:14:13,950
No son or daughter of Atlantis
will ever tell you.

551
01:14:29,549 --> 01:14:31,217
Our people have guarded the Mother Box

552
01:14:31,301 --> 01:14:32,385
for thousands of years.

553
01:14:38,558 --> 01:14:41,186
| will never betray my own people.

554
01:14:52,739 --> 01:14:55,241
You already have.

555
01:15:55,593 --> 01:15:57,804
This was taken
in the deepest trench on Earth.

556
01:15:58,388 --> 01:16:00,473
He must be an Atlantean.

557
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:01,766
A water-breather.

558
01:16:01,933 --> 01:16:03,601
He was breathing air
when I talked to him.

559
01:16:03,768 --> 01:16:05,562
Mixed-blood, then.

560
01:16:05,729 --> 01:16:07,605
He said he'll fight with us?

561
01:16:07,772 --> 01:16:09,107
More or less.

562
01:16:10,483 --> 01:16:12,569
More more or more less?

563
01:16:12,986 --> 01:16:13,987
Probably more less.

564
01:16:14,154 --> 01:16:15,947
-He said no?
-He said no.

565
01:16:16,406 --> 01:16:18,116
Atlanteans can be tricky.

566
01:16:19,033 --> 01:16:21,786
My people went to war with them once.

567
01:16:22,912 --> 01:16:24,998
I'm not sure we can trust him.

568
01:16:25,165 --> 01:16:26,207
Diana, if we're gonna do this,

569
01:16:26,374 --> 01:16:27,417
you're gonna need to be open

570
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:28,710
to more things that we didn't...

571
01:16:28,793 --> 01:16:29,794
you know...

572
01:16:29,919 --> 01:16:31,588
-I'm sorry. That's okay.
-Sorry. My fault.

573
01:16:31,755 --> 01:16:32,797
Don't worry about it.

574
01:16:32,964 --> 01:16:34,215
- Let's...
-It happens.

575
01:16:34,299 --> 01:16:35,300
- So...

576
01:16:35,467 --> 01:16:37,469
This is the third person.

577
01:16:37,635 --> 01:16:40,054
Disappears for 1/30 of a second here.

578
01:16:40,221 --> 01:16:41,723
One frame of video, see?

579
01:16:41,890 --> 01:16:44,517
Barry Allen. Central City.

580
01:16:44,601 --> 01:16:45,602
Go to him.

581
01:16:45,685 --> 01:16:47,395
I'll work on number four.

582
01:16:47,562 --> 01:16:50,690
Organic and biomechatronic body parts.

583
01:16:53,234 --> 01:16:55,236
He's a cyborg.

584
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:16,341
- Ready!
- Break!

585
01:17:31,856 --> 01:17:32,857
Three...

586
01:17:33,233 --> 01:17:34,776
eighty...

587
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:37,946
set... go!

588
01:17:51,209 --> 01:17:53,461
Your son may be captain
of the football team

589
01:17:53,628 --> 01:17:56,631
and a certified genius, Mrs. Stone...

590
01:17:56,798 --> 01:17:58,883
Dr. Stone.

591
01:18:01,427 --> 01:18:03,429
...but that doesn't mean
he can hack into our system

592
01:18:03,596 --> 01:18:05,431
to change his friend's grades.

593
01:18:06,391 --> 01:18:09,727
Sarah's family
lost their house this year.

594
01:18:10,311 --> 01:18:12,730
How could that child pass her classes?

595
01:18:14,315 --> 01:18:17,360
Victor helped her
'cause he's got a good heart.

596
01:18:17,527 --> 01:18:19,571
What did you do to help her?

597
01:19:43,696 --> 01:19:46,616
-Your father--
-Mom, Mom, don't.

598
01:19:48,201 --> 01:19:50,954
-He got held up at the lab.

599
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:54,165
Okay. He always does.

600
01:19:56,751 --> 01:19:57,752
He wanted to be here.

601
01:19:58,294 --> 01:19:59,921
You always say that.

602
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:01,965
Ma, you gotta stop
making excuses for him.

603
01:20:02,131 --> 01:20:05,093
You're just as busy as he is,
but you still make the time.

604
01:20:05,176 --> 01:20:08,221
He just has difficulty
showing it, but...

605
01:20:08,888 --> 01:20:10,723
| know he's proud of you.

606
01:20:11,265 --> 01:20:13,226
We both are, Victor.

607
01:20:13,893 --> 01:20:16,062
Hey, hey, hey.

608
01:20:17,230 --> 01:20:20,316
With everything I know you can do today,

609
01:20:20,483 --> 01:20:23,236
| can't wait to see
what you're gonna be tomorrow.

610
01:20:28,574 --> 01:20:30,284
Dr. Stone, I'm sorry,

611
01:20:31,369 --> 01:20:33,162
your wife didn't survive.

612
01:20:34,831 --> 01:20:36,916
I'm afraid your son won't either.

613
01:20:51,097 --> 01:20:52,765
I won't let you die.

614
01:20:55,727 --> 01:20:57,270
| won't allow it.

615
01:21:03,568 --> 01:21:05,319
| won't allow it.

616
01:21:08,781 --> 01:21:09,782
Victor.

617
01:21:11,159 --> 01:21:13,911
Victor, you're not stuck in here.

618
01:21:14,746 --> 01:21:17,498
You still have a life ahead of you.

619
01:21:18,166 --> 01:21:21,544
Your mother would have
wanted you to live that life.

620
01:21:24,088 --> 01:21:25,631
If you were there,

621
01:21:27,008 --> 01:21:28,885
Mom would still be alive.

622
01:21:31,721 --> 01:21:33,639
All right, look,

623
01:21:35,016 --> 01:21:37,435
you don't have to give me
a second chance,

624
01:21:37,518 --> 01:21:39,062
but give yourself one.

625
01:21:41,105 --> 01:21:44,150
If you can't stand looking at me,

626
01:21:45,860 --> 01:21:47,487
try listening.

627
01:22:16,224 --> 01:22:18,226
What you can do now, Victor.

628
01:22:19,060 --> 01:22:22,605
Your physical strength
is just the tip of the iceberg.

629
01:22:22,772 --> 01:22:25,316
The tip of the tip.

630
01:22:55,388 --> 01:22:57,515
In the world of ones and zeroes,

631
01:22:57,598 --> 01:23:00,268
you are the absolute master.

632
01:23:00,434 --> 01:23:03,020
No firewall can stop you.

633
01:23:03,187 --> 01:23:05,481
No encryption can defy you.

634
01:23:05,648 --> 01:23:08,401
We're all at your mercy, Vic.

635
01:23:08,568 --> 01:23:10,945
From our power grids
to our telecommunications,

636
01:23:11,112 --> 01:23:13,156
everyone's lives are controlled

637
01:23:13,322 --> 01:23:16,284
and dominated
by complex digital networks

638
01:23:16,450 --> 01:23:20,538
that will bend
without effort to your will.

639
01:23:30,882 --> 01:23:32,508
The fate of the world

640
01:23:32,592 --> 01:23:35,386
will literally rest in your hands.

641
01:23:43,186 --> 01:23:45,354
Its entire nuclear arsenal,

642
01:23:45,438 --> 01:23:48,232
you could launch with a thought.

643
01:23:59,035 --> 01:24:00,536
The world's monetary systems

644
01:24:00,620 --> 01:24:02,205
and its complex interactions

645
01:24:02,371 --> 01:24:05,166
will seem as easy
to manipulate for you

646
01:24:05,249 --> 01:24:06,834
as a child's plaything.

647
01:24:40,868 --> 01:24:44,622
The question... No, the challenge

648
01:24:45,498 --> 01:24:47,959
won't be doing it.

649
01:24:48,834 --> 01:24:50,711
It will be not doing.

650
01:24:50,878 --> 01:24:52,880
Not seeing.

651
01:24:54,924 --> 01:24:57,218
It is the burden of this responsibility

652
01:24:57,385 --> 01:25:00,680
that will define you
and who you choose to be.

653
01:25:32,295 --> 01:25:33,379
Now, make a wish.

654
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:35,673
One more time.

655
01:25:36,632 --> 01:25:39,010
Good job. Wave to Grandma!

656
01:25:39,176 --> 01:25:40,344
Hi, Grandma!

657
01:26:40,571 --> 01:26:41,739
What?

658
01:26:43,741 --> 01:26:45,368
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

659
01:26:46,619 --> 01:26:47,995
Oh, my God.

660
01:26:48,162 --> 01:26:49,914
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

661
01:26:55,252 --> 01:26:56,629
Victor...

662
01:26:58,255 --> 01:27:01,634
Victor, these are the words
and deductions of a scientist.

663
01:27:02,802 --> 01:27:04,970
That's how I've been speaking to you.

664
01:27:05,679 --> 01:27:06,680
Now,

665
01:27:09,058 --> 01:27:10,976
let me speak to you from my heart,

666
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:12,728
not as a scientist,

667
01:27:13,270 --> 01:27:14,480
as a father.

668
01:27:28,828 --> 01:27:29,954
Hey.

669
01:27:31,205 --> 01:27:32,748
Hey, you!

670
01:27:48,722 --> 01:27:51,559
Because you are
holding yourself back.

671
01:27:52,226 --> 01:27:55,271
You're going in circles, man.

672
01:27:55,438 --> 01:27:57,606
Holding down three dead-end jobs,

673
01:27:57,773 --> 01:27:58,774
going on four.

674
01:27:58,858 --> 01:28:00,401
Where do you even find the time?

675
01:28:00,568 --> 01:28:01,694
I make the time.

676
01:28:01,861 --> 01:28:02,987
- I just need one more gig...
-Barry.

677
01:28:03,154 --> 01:28:04,196
...then I'm gonna pay
for my own tuition.

678
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:05,281
You can't.

679
01:28:05,364 --> 01:28:06,490
Like I always said I would.

680
01:28:06,574 --> 01:28:07,658
You cannot keep doing this to yourself.

681
01:28:07,825 --> 01:28:09,493
Okay. I really don't wanna
talk about this again.

682
01:28:09,660 --> 01:28:11,537
-Please, we have 10 minutes.
-And this is all to pay

683
01:28:11,620 --> 01:28:12,705
for a criminal justice degree, huh?

684
01:28:12,788 --> 01:28:13,789
Yeah.

685
01:28:13,956 --> 01:28:14,957
For what?

686
01:28:15,124 --> 01:28:18,335
Huh, let's see.
As I talk to my father,

687
01:28:18,502 --> 01:28:20,045
who's still in prison for the murder

688
01:28:20,129 --> 01:28:21,297
of my mother, which he didn't commit.

689
01:28:21,464 --> 01:28:23,424
Yeah, how did I get interested
in criminal justice?

690
01:28:23,591 --> 01:28:25,134
| can't remember.

691
01:28:25,301 --> 01:28:26,302
Oh, boy.

692
01:28:26,385 --> 01:28:28,929
This path has clearly chosen me, Dad.

693
01:28:29,930 --> 01:28:31,015
Give me your hand, man.

694
01:28:36,645 --> 01:28:39,857
I want you
to listen to me, Barry.

695
01:28:40,024 --> 01:28:43,527
| want you to listen to me,
because I mean this.

696
01:28:49,492 --> 01:28:51,368
| want you to give all that up.

697
01:28:54,371 --> 01:28:57,416
And I want you to stop coming to see me.

698
01:28:59,793 --> 01:29:02,796
| am a drag on your life.

699
01:29:08,219 --> 01:29:09,345
Okay. Um...

700
01:29:10,262 --> 01:29:13,390
Please don't ever say that to me again.

701
01:29:13,807 --> 01:29:15,059
Please.

702
01:29:15,226 --> 01:29:18,354
Hey, you know what criminal justice
would be for me?

703
01:29:18,521 --> 01:29:23,317
My son not wasting his life.

704
01:29:24,735 --> 01:29:26,487
You can be whatever you wanna be.

705
01:29:26,570 --> 01:29:27,905
You're brilliant, man.

706
01:29:30,449 --> 01:29:33,244
Absolute best of the best.

707
01:29:35,079 --> 01:29:39,792
| can't sit here and watch you
run in place in Central City

708
01:29:39,959 --> 01:29:41,710
for some old dude

709
01:29:41,877 --> 01:29:45,047
who's not going anywhere.

710
01:29:45,214 --> 01:29:46,549
-Dad, that's not true.
- It's time.

711
01:29:46,715 --> 01:29:47,716
That's not true.

712
01:29:47,883 --> 01:29:49,385
Let's go, Allen. Allen!

713
01:29:49,552 --> 01:29:51,220
| want you to make your own future.

714
01:29:51,387 --> 01:29:53,055
You're living in the past.
Make your own future.

715
01:29:53,222 --> 01:29:54,723
Open gate.

716
01:29:54,807 --> 01:29:55,849
Great.

717
01:30:00,020 --> 01:30:02,147
"You're living in the past.
Make your own future, Barry."

718
01:30:02,314 --> 01:30:03,857
Clear. Close the gate.

719
01:30:56,535 --> 01:30:59,204
Barry Allen. Bruce Wayne.

720
01:31:00,039 --> 01:31:01,707
You said that like it explains

721
01:31:01,790 --> 01:31:04,001
why there's a total stranger in my place

722
01:31:04,168 --> 01:31:06,962
sitting in the dark,
in my second favorite chair.

723
01:31:09,048 --> 01:31:10,841
Tell me about this.

724
01:31:14,970 --> 01:31:17,681
This is a person
who looks exactly like me,

725
01:31:17,848 --> 01:31:20,559
but who is definitely not me.

726
01:31:21,685 --> 01:31:23,562
Somebody... I don't know.

727
01:31:23,729 --> 01:31:25,564
Hippie, long hair.

728
01:31:25,731 --> 01:31:28,484
Very attractive Jewish boy.

729
01:31:30,027 --> 01:31:31,987
Who drinks milk, I don't drink milk.

730
01:31:32,780 --> 01:31:34,323
| know you have abilities.

731
01:31:34,490 --> 01:31:36,325
| just don't know what they are.

732
01:31:36,742 --> 01:31:37,826
My special skills

733
01:31:37,910 --> 01:31:40,663
include viola, web design,

734
01:31:40,829 --> 01:31:43,624
fluent in sign language,
gorilla sign language.

735
01:31:43,791 --> 01:31:47,127
Silica-based sand quartz fabric.

736
01:31:47,544 --> 01:31:49,630
Abrasion resistant, heat resistant.

737
01:31:49,797 --> 01:31:51,674
Uh, yeah, I do competitive ice dancing.

738
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:53,717
It's what they use on the space shuttle

739
01:31:53,801 --> 01:31:55,427
to prevent it from burning up
on re-entry.

740
01:31:55,594 --> 01:31:58,097
| do very competitive ice dancing.

741
01:31:59,473 --> 01:32:01,475
Look, man.
| don't know who you are,

742
01:32:01,558 --> 01:32:03,560
but whoever you're looking for,

743
01:32:03,727 --> 01:32:04,728
it's not me.

744
01:32:04,853 --> 01:32:06,313
Uh...

745
01:32:46,562 --> 01:32:48,147
You're the Batman?

746
01:32:48,564 --> 01:32:50,315
So, you're fast.

747
01:32:51,608 --> 01:32:53,152
That feels like an oversimplification.

748
01:32:53,318 --> 01:32:55,070
I'm putting together a team.

749
01:32:55,237 --> 01:32:57,322
People with special abilities.

750
01:32:57,489 --> 01:32:58,991
You see,
| believe enemies are coming.

751
01:32:59,158 --> 01:33:01,243
Stop right there. I'm in.

752
01:33:02,286 --> 01:33:03,370
You are?

753
01:33:03,746 --> 01:33:04,788
Just like that?

754
01:33:04,955 --> 01:33:06,081
Yeah.

755
01:33:08,041 --> 01:33:10,127
| need friends.

756
01:33:10,627 --> 01:33:13,589
Great. Great.

757
01:33:14,131 --> 01:33:15,883
Can I keep this?

758
01:33:16,508 --> 01:33:18,343
It's like this layer
of dimensional reality,

759
01:33:18,427 --> 01:33:20,095
and it seems to manipulate space-time.

760
01:33:20,262 --> 01:33:21,472
| call it the Speed Force.

761
01:33:21,638 --> 01:33:23,474
Causes me to burn a tremendous
amount of calories

762
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:26,268
so I am just a black hole of snacks.

763
01:33:26,435 --> 01:33:28,270
|I am a snack hole.

764
01:33:29,146 --> 01:33:31,982
How many people are
on this special fight team?

765
01:33:32,149 --> 01:33:34,067
-Three, including you.
-Three?

766
01:33:34,234 --> 01:33:36,111
Against what?

767
01:33:36,987 --> 01:33:38,447
I'll tell you on the plane.

768
01:33:39,072 --> 01:33:40,282
Plane?

769
01:33:40,949 --> 01:33:42,701
What are your superpowers again?

770
01:33:42,868 --> 01:33:44,578
I'm rich.

771
01:34:07,684 --> 01:34:09,478
Oh, Miss Prince, let me do that.

772
01:34:09,645 --> 01:34:11,647
No, that's okay.
| can do it myself.

773
01:34:12,773 --> 01:34:14,316
Would you like to have some?

774
01:34:14,483 --> 01:34:15,776
Uh, no, thank you.

775
01:34:17,152 --> 01:34:19,154
If you put the water in first.

776
01:34:19,863 --> 01:34:22,866
- Of course.
-So we don't scald the tea.

777
01:34:25,786 --> 01:34:27,329
-Yes.
-Great.

778
01:34:27,496 --> 01:34:29,456
No, that's probably enough tea.

779
01:34:29,623 --> 01:34:30,999
All right.

780
01:34:32,125 --> 01:34:33,627
Are you sure you don't
wanna have some?

781
01:34:33,794 --> 01:34:37,047
| won't, thank you.
And then leave it to mash.

782
01:34:37,798 --> 01:34:40,592
I will. I will, definitely will.

783
01:34:40,884 --> 01:34:43,095
Uh... What are you working on?

784
01:34:43,262 --> 01:34:44,596
It's a gauntlet

785
01:34:45,180 --> 01:34:48,809
lined with specialized
polymer solar cells.

786
01:34:49,101 --> 01:34:51,186
-Wow.
-Here, let me show you.

787
01:34:51,687 --> 01:34:54,690
We borrowed this
from the Kryptonian scout ship.

788
01:34:56,275 --> 01:34:57,693
Oh, maybe you should, uh...

789
01:34:57,901 --> 01:35:00,362
-a fraction. Thank you, thank you.
-Of course.

790
01:35:05,492 --> 01:35:07,286
Ah.

791
01:35:07,411 --> 01:35:10,372
Ah, now, let's see how that did.

792
01:35:10,539 --> 01:35:12,291
-Hal Yes.

793
01:35:12,958 --> 01:35:14,585
Not to be sneezed at.

794
01:35:14,751 --> 01:35:17,170
A gauntlet that captures
and dissipates energy.

795
01:35:17,337 --> 01:35:18,839
It's Master Wayne's idea.

796
01:35:19,131 --> 01:35:21,383
Maybe you should work on a lasso, too?

797
01:35:21,550 --> 01:35:24,177
-In black, of course.
-Oh.

798
01:35:31,143 --> 01:35:34,104
-All right. Victor Stone.

799
01:35:50,370 --> 01:35:52,372
Something is not working.

800
01:35:52,831 --> 01:35:54,458
Mmm.

801
01:36:04,176 --> 01:36:06,595
Looks like you have a date, Miss Prince.

802
01:37:03,652 --> 01:37:06,738
Why are you looking for me, Diana?

803
01:37:06,905 --> 01:37:08,156
You know who I am.

804
01:37:08,323 --> 01:37:10,659
| know more than
you can possibly imagine.

805
01:37:10,826 --> 01:37:13,412
Then maybe you already know
| need your help.

806
01:37:14,079 --> 01:37:15,080
The world does.

807
01:37:16,456 --> 01:37:18,166
Fuck the world.

808
01:37:19,793 --> 01:37:22,170
You've obviously
been through a great deal.

809
01:37:23,422 --> 01:37:25,924
| can't begin to imagine what.

810
01:37:26,633 --> 01:37:30,012
But whatever happened to you,
you have gifts now.

811
01:37:30,262 --> 01:37:31,972
Gifts?

812
01:37:32,139 --> 01:37:34,307
What part of this
looks like a gift to you?

813
01:37:34,474 --> 01:37:35,642
We need you, Victor.

814
01:37:36,309 --> 01:37:37,894
And maybe you need us.

815
01:37:38,061 --> 01:37:39,730
| don't need anyone.

816
01:37:41,940 --> 01:37:42,983
Not anymore.

817
01:37:43,150 --> 01:37:45,652
| told myself the same for a long time.

818
01:37:52,492 --> 01:37:55,203
| lost someone I loved once.

819
01:37:58,081 --> 01:38:02,878
| shut myself off from everyone.

820
01:38:04,504 --> 01:38:07,215
But I had to learn
to open back up again.

821
01:38:09,926 --> 01:38:13,346
The truth is, I'm still working on it.

822
01:38:13,513 --> 01:38:16,725
And if you asked to meet me...

823
01:38:17,601 --> 01:38:20,353
you're working on it, too.

824
01:39:32,050 --> 01:39:34,052
You were right about the metal sample

825
01:39:34,136 --> 01:39:35,720
from the Superman ship.

826
01:39:35,887 --> 01:39:39,015
When we bombard it with X-rays
from the electron-laser,

827
01:39:39,432 --> 01:39:40,892
look what happens.

828
01:39:49,901 --> 01:39:51,820
3.5 million kelvin.

829
01:39:51,987 --> 01:39:54,948
The inner core of the metal
becomes superheated.

830
01:39:55,115 --> 01:39:57,450
Hot, dense matter.

831
01:40:00,745 --> 01:40:03,540
You're looking at
the hottest thing on Earth.

832
01:40:03,707 --> 01:40:05,625
Exact words I said to my prom date.

833
01:40:06,001 --> 01:40:07,544
She dumped me anyway.

834
01:40:07,669 --> 01:40:08,920
Yeah.

835
01:40:13,091 --> 01:40:13,925
Hey, Doc,

836
01:40:14,259 --> 01:40:16,136
do you think Batman is connected

837
01:40:16,219 --> 01:40:18,722
to the object the CID is looking for?

838
01:40:19,764 --> 01:40:22,893
You know, 6-1-9-8-27

839
01:40:24,060 --> 01:40:25,145
No...

840
01:40:26,146 --> 01:40:27,355
| don't.

841
01:41:02,182 --> 01:41:04,267
Oh, Victor.

842
01:41:17,822 --> 01:41:19,407
-(gasps]

843
01:41:21,409 --> 01:41:23,328
All right! Let's go!

844
01:41:24,663 --> 01:41:25,872
Commissioner Gordon?

845
01:41:25,956 --> 01:41:27,123
Come on!

846
01:41:27,207 --> 01:41:28,416
Your messages.

847
01:41:28,541 --> 01:41:29,668
Hey, hey!

848
01:41:32,837 --> 01:41:35,423
Don't have to see the sky
to know it's a full moon.

849
01:41:35,590 --> 01:41:38,426
Half of Gotham's
reality-challenged community showed up.

850
01:41:38,593 --> 01:41:40,762
Say they saw flying monsters
by the harbor.

851
01:41:40,929 --> 01:41:42,973
You were right, Ma. Police Academy.

852
01:41:43,056 --> 01:41:44,683
What's wrong with dental school?

853
01:41:47,769 --> 01:41:50,063
"Attacked by a flying vampire."

854
01:41:51,064 --> 01:41:54,025
"Looked like a giant bat
with huge fangs."

855
01:41:54,192 --> 01:41:55,986
On a possibly related note,

856
01:41:56,152 --> 01:41:58,488
sketch of the suspect in the abductions

857
01:41:58,571 --> 01:41:59,739
at the lab across the harbor.

858
01:41:59,906 --> 01:42:02,450
-Looks like--
- I know what it looks like, Crispus.

859
01:42:03,660 --> 01:42:06,121
Come on, you think he fights
criminals for 20 years here

860
01:42:06,288 --> 01:42:08,957
and then he goes to Metropolis
and kidnaps eight people?

861
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:11,084
I'll talk to him tonight.

862
01:42:11,251 --> 01:42:12,794
How, Jim?

863
01:42:12,961 --> 01:42:14,421
How do you think?

864
01:42:32,689 --> 01:42:33,898
Silas?

865
01:42:34,190 --> 01:42:35,358
Hey, hey.

866
01:42:35,525 --> 01:42:36,860
Hey, hey!

867
01:42:41,656 --> 01:42:43,825
- Oh, my goodness.
- Where's the cyborg?

868
01:42:43,992 --> 01:42:45,160
His name is Victor.

869
01:42:45,952 --> 01:42:48,705
We met, spoke.

870
01:42:49,664 --> 01:42:51,082
Give him time.

871
01:42:51,875 --> 01:42:53,835
You must be Barry. I'm Diana.

872
01:42:54,002 --> 01:42:57,756
Hi, Barry. I'm Diana.
That's not right. Great.

873
01:42:57,922 --> 01:43:00,050
- So, this is us.
- Yeah, this is us.

874
01:43:00,216 --> 01:43:01,259
Oh!

875
01:43:01,384 --> 01:43:04,429
Awesome! It's the Bat-Signal.
That's your...

876
01:43:04,596 --> 01:43:06,681
Oh, sorry.  That's your signal.

877
01:43:06,848 --> 01:43:08,058
That means we have to go now.

878
01:43:08,224 --> 01:43:12,020
-Yeah, that's what that means.
-It's so cool.

879
01:44:09,369 --> 01:44:11,121
Commander Mera, I told the king

880
01:44:11,204 --> 01:44:12,831
the perimeter guards were taken.

881
01:44:13,039 --> 01:44:14,582
He won't send reinforcements.

882
01:44:14,749 --> 01:44:17,377
He says all the reserves are needed
in the rebel regions.

883
01:44:17,544 --> 01:44:21,297
He's as shortsighted
as he is cruel.

884
01:44:21,965 --> 01:44:23,550
All right, take what men we have left

885
01:44:23,716 --> 01:44:25,468
and form a phalanx
around the Mother Box.

886
01:46:05,318 --> 01:46:07,362
You can't escape.

887
01:46:08,112 --> 01:46:10,073
I'm not trying to.

888
01:48:12,654 --> 01:48:14,530
Vulko told me you would come.

889
01:48:15,031 --> 01:48:17,742
The firstborn of beloved Queen Atlanna.

890
01:48:20,370 --> 01:48:21,663
Wait.

891
01:48:23,665 --> 01:48:24,749
Please.

892
01:48:28,336 --> 01:48:29,671
| knew her.

893
01:48:31,964 --> 01:48:33,549
Well, that makes one of us.

894
01:48:34,425 --> 01:48:36,010
My parents died in the wars.

895
01:48:37,929 --> 01:48:39,138
She took me in.

896
01:48:39,514 --> 01:48:40,765
What a saint.

897
01:48:41,474 --> 01:48:43,601
You dare speak of
Queen Atlanna that way?

898
01:48:43,768 --> 01:48:46,396
Your queen left me
on my father's doorstep

899
01:48:46,562 --> 01:48:48,147
and never gave me another thought.

900
01:48:48,314 --> 01:48:50,525
Your mother left you to save your life.

901
01:48:51,651 --> 01:48:54,112
You cannot imagine how it hurt her.

902
01:48:55,697 --> 01:48:57,740
What it cost her.

903
01:48:58,991 --> 01:49:01,160
But you're not a defenseless child now.

904
01:49:03,579 --> 01:49:05,164
It would have been her responsibility

905
01:49:05,331 --> 01:49:08,501
to follow that monster
to the surface and stop him.

906
01:49:09,085 --> 01:49:10,169
Now,

907
01:49:11,462 --> 01:49:12,797
it's yours.

908
01:50:17,153 --> 01:50:18,613
Yes.

909
01:50:41,552 --> 01:50:42,929
Steppenwolf,

910
01:50:43,095 --> 01:50:45,014
tell me what you've learned.

911
01:50:45,181 --> 01:50:47,809
Two boxes found and awake.

912
01:50:47,975 --> 01:50:50,937
With the combined power
of the two Mother Boxes,

913
01:50:51,103 --> 01:50:54,106
I've been able to finish
the stronghold's defenses.

914
01:50:54,273 --> 01:50:56,692
Where is the third Mother Box?

915
01:50:56,859 --> 01:51:00,988
The parademons sense its presence
and search for the third.

916
01:51:01,155 --> 01:51:04,408
They have taken prisoners
who carry its scent.

917
01:51:05,159 --> 01:51:06,202
Go.

918
01:51:07,036 --> 01:51:08,955
Interrogate the prisoners.

919
01:51:09,747 --> 01:51:11,624
Find the third.

920
01:51:13,167 --> 01:51:15,336
They will tell me what they know,

921
01:51:16,587 --> 01:51:19,090
or I will rip it from them.

922
01:52:02,425 --> 01:52:04,010
How many of you are there?

923
01:52:04,844 --> 01:52:05,970
Not enough.

924
01:52:08,055 --> 01:52:10,308
Dozens of witnesses
all over Gotham.

925
01:52:10,474 --> 01:52:13,185
Description matches the suspect
in the Metropolis abductions.

926
01:52:13,769 --> 01:52:14,812
Parademons.

927
01:52:15,438 --> 01:52:16,689
Okay.

928
01:52:16,856 --> 01:52:19,191
The demons must have caught
the scent of a Mother Box.

929
01:52:19,442 --> 01:52:20,443
At the lab.

930
01:52:20,610 --> 01:52:22,945
They carried people away
to find out what they know.

931
01:52:23,112 --> 01:52:24,238
So the eight may still be alive.

932
01:52:24,322 --> 01:52:25,323
Nine.

933
01:52:25,406 --> 01:52:26,657
Oh.

934
01:52:27,366 --> 01:52:29,869
The head of STARLABS was taken tonight.

935
01:52:35,082 --> 01:52:37,627
Wow, okay. So, another scientist.

936
01:52:37,793 --> 01:52:39,086
So, how do we find him?

937
01:52:39,253 --> 01:52:40,922
There must be a nest nearby.

938
01:52:41,088 --> 01:52:45,176
| plotted all the sightings
in Metropolis, Gotham.

939
01:52:45,343 --> 01:52:47,470
No discernable pattern I can see.

940
01:52:47,637 --> 01:52:48,930
The lines on the map don't converge.

941
01:52:49,096 --> 01:52:50,431
On land.

942
01:52:50,640 --> 01:52:52,016
These lead back to Stryker's Island,

943
01:52:52,099 --> 01:52:53,184
between the two cities.

944
01:52:53,351 --> 01:52:55,770
These are air vents.
They all lead down to the tunnel

945
01:52:55,937 --> 01:52:58,314
to a Metropolis project
that was abandoned in '29.

946
01:52:58,481 --> 01:53:00,066
The nest could be there.

947
01:53:00,858 --> 01:53:02,777
Uh,
is he coming with us now,

948
01:53:02,944 --> 01:53:04,278
because we're not all
gonna fit in your car.

949
01:53:04,820 --> 01:53:06,238
| have something bigger.

950
01:53:07,573 --> 01:53:09,200
Do you really think that...

951
01:53:10,534 --> 01:53:14,080
Oh, wow, they just...
They really just vanish, huh?

952
01:53:14,163 --> 01:53:16,624
Oh. That's rude.

953
01:53:55,329 --> 01:53:57,415
We're close.

954
01:53:57,581 --> 01:53:59,583
The scent of the enemy.

955
01:54:00,292 --> 01:54:01,460
Of absence.

956
01:54:02,044 --> 01:54:03,587
Darkness.

957
01:54:04,296 --> 01:54:05,297
Death.

958
01:54:05,715 --> 01:54:06,799
Where are we, Alfred?

959
01:54:06,882 --> 01:54:07,967
Stryker's Island.

960
01:54:08,134 --> 01:54:10,386
You should be directly under

961
01:54:10,469 --> 01:54:12,680
the venting tower for the tunnel.

962
01:54:13,264 --> 01:54:14,473
Now look to your left,

963
01:54:14,557 --> 01:54:16,684
you'll see a staircase
to the machine room.

964
01:54:16,892 --> 01:54:19,437
Thermal scan shows
a cluster of people there.

965
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:20,521
That's it.

966
01:54:20,896 --> 01:54:21,897
Let's go.

967
01:54:36,328 --> 01:54:38,831
Right.
Is there... Is there a plan?

968
01:54:40,374 --> 01:54:41,667
Either of you?

969
01:54:41,834 --> 01:54:43,002
Don't engage alone.

970
01:54:43,794 --> 01:54:45,046
We do this together.

971
01:54:54,013 --> 01:54:55,848
| heard about you.

972
01:54:57,641 --> 01:54:58,809
Didn't think you were real.

973
01:54:59,268 --> 01:55:00,811
I'm real when it's useful.

974
01:55:11,072 --> 01:55:12,907
| grow tired of your silence.

975
01:55:12,990 --> 01:55:15,201
Now tell me, where is the Mother Box?

976
01:55:21,999 --> 01:55:24,210
Please. We have families.

977
01:55:24,376 --> 01:55:26,462
Then you have weakness.

978
01:55:26,629 --> 01:55:28,089
Steppenwolf.

979
01:55:28,255 --> 01:55:32,426
Okay, I'm guessing that's the bad guy.

980
01:55:32,593 --> 01:55:33,636
Good guess.

981
01:55:34,178 --> 01:55:37,640
I'm really, really missing Superman
right now.

982
01:55:37,807 --> 01:55:39,975
Circle to the other side.

983
01:55:40,142 --> 01:55:42,144
We'll surround them and surprise him.

984
01:55:46,690 --> 01:55:48,275
You have been near a Mother Box.

985
01:55:48,734 --> 01:55:50,444
The scent is on you.

986
01:55:50,611 --> 01:55:52,071
| don't know what you're talking about.

987
01:55:52,238 --> 01:55:54,073
-Where is it?
- Leave him alone!

988
01:55:54,240 --> 01:55:56,492
He... He doesn't know.

989
01:56:00,079 --> 01:56:01,872
Wait, please, please!

990
01:56:07,044 --> 01:56:10,172
You carry
the scent, too. But stronger.

991
01:56:10,548 --> 01:56:12,675
| will die before I tell you.

992
01:56:12,842 --> 01:56:14,677
You'll die if you don't.

993
01:56:15,094 --> 01:56:16,095
No!

994
01:56:25,437 --> 01:56:26,480
Victor.

995
01:56:26,647 --> 01:56:27,940
Kill them both.

996
01:56:31,485 --> 01:56:33,571
Ah, Amazon.

997
01:56:33,988 --> 01:56:36,490
But not like your sisters.

998
01:56:36,657 --> 01:56:37,908
Stronger.

999
01:57:08,856 --> 01:57:11,066
Amazon.

1000
01:57:13,527 --> 01:57:14,904
Hold!

1001
01:57:15,279 --> 01:57:17,489
This one will be mine.

1002
01:57:19,450 --> 01:57:21,869
| belong to no one.

1003
01:57:35,883 --> 01:57:37,927
Guys, this is not together.

1004
01:57:44,934 --> 01:57:46,101
Help get those people out of here.

1005
01:57:46,268 --> 01:57:48,354
I'll make sure these things
follow me.

1006
01:57:58,364 --> 01:57:59,782
Everybody, move!

1007
01:58:08,540 --> 01:58:10,042
A little quicker.

1008
01:58:12,419 --> 01:58:13,796
-Are you good?
-Yeah.

1009
01:58:13,963 --> 01:58:16,382
I've got this. Keep moving.

1010
01:58:18,384 --> 01:58:19,385
This way.

1011
01:58:55,754 --> 01:58:57,172
The energy is dissipating.

1012
01:58:57,339 --> 01:58:58,841
My gauntlet worked!

1013
01:59:00,092 --> 01:59:02,386
Celebrate later, Alfred.
| need the Nightcrawler.

1014
01:59:02,553 --> 01:59:04,179
Thought you'd never ask.

1015
01:59:04,763 --> 01:59:06,598
Crawler's on the way.
Initiating remote mode.

1016
01:59:37,046 --> 01:59:38,047
Thank you, Alfred.

1017
01:59:38,213 --> 01:59:39,590
Don't mention it.

1018
02:00:02,321 --> 02:00:03,322
No!

1019
02:00:06,992 --> 02:00:07,993
Whew.

1020
02:00:11,330 --> 02:00:12,790
They're safe. Get back to the tunnel.

1021
02:00:12,956 --> 02:00:16,043
Tunnel. Right.
Aliens, bad guy, sword lady.

1022
02:00:27,846 --> 02:00:29,223
My turn.

1023
02:01:51,597 --> 02:01:53,098
Catastrophic failure
of all systems.

1024
02:01:53,265 --> 02:01:55,684
Are you all right, Master Wayne?

1025
02:01:55,851 --> 02:01:56,852
Are you all right?

1026
02:02:07,571 --> 02:02:11,074
You have the blood
of the old gods in you.

1027
02:02:25,380 --> 02:02:26,381
You okay?

1028
02:02:26,965 --> 02:02:28,300
Mm.

1029
02:02:28,383 --> 02:02:30,010
Wasn't sure you'd come.

1030
02:02:31,053 --> 02:02:32,346
You're my father.

1031
02:02:35,849 --> 02:02:36,850
Go.

1032
02:02:50,489 --> 02:02:51,490
No!

1033
02:03:36,994 --> 02:03:39,329
Relax, Alfred.
I'll take it from here.

1034
02:03:40,914 --> 02:03:42,749
Uh, do I know you?

1035
02:04:13,655 --> 02:04:14,906
What are we under, right now?

1036
02:04:15,657 --> 02:04:16,950
Gotham Harbor.

1037
02:04:55,656 --> 02:04:56,948
Who is that?

1038
02:05:22,265 --> 02:05:23,433
Come on.

1039
02:05:28,563 --> 02:05:29,773
Diana, get on!

1040
02:06:31,668 --> 02:06:33,170
What is it?

1041
02:06:40,969 --> 02:06:42,387
Show me.

1042
02:07:21,551 --> 02:07:23,178
It is here.

1043
02:07:23,929 --> 02:07:26,890
On this world.

1044
02:08:00,799 --> 02:08:03,760
Sir, you're gonna be in quarantine
for possible alien microbes.

1045
02:08:03,927 --> 02:08:05,595
U.S. government protocols
require that...

1046
02:08:05,762 --> 02:08:08,557
| know the requirements. I wrote them.

1047
02:08:13,103 --> 02:08:14,437
It called to him.

1048
02:08:14,604 --> 02:08:16,147
The Mother Box.

1049
02:08:16,314 --> 02:08:17,691
The one he already has.

1050
02:08:18,024 --> 02:08:21,069
He has two.
He took the Mother Box from Atlantis.

1051
02:08:21,236 --> 02:08:23,530
All he needs now is the lost Box of Men.

1052
02:08:23,697 --> 02:08:24,865
If he doesn't already have it.

1053
02:08:28,535 --> 02:08:29,953
He doesn't have it.

1054
02:08:33,164 --> 02:08:34,332
| do.

1055
02:08:44,885 --> 02:08:46,970
Have you finished the conquest?

1056
02:08:47,137 --> 02:08:48,388
Not yet, DeSaad.

1057
02:08:48,555 --> 02:08:50,807
Then why do you summon me?

1058
02:08:50,974 --> 02:08:52,642
| bring news.

1059
02:08:52,809 --> 02:08:55,729
Before mighty Darkseid
came to the throne,

1060
02:08:55,896 --> 02:09:00,400
he searched the universe
for the ultimate weapon.

1061
02:09:01,026 --> 02:09:03,194
The Anti-Life Equation.

1062
02:09:03,361 --> 02:09:05,447
The key to controlling all life

1063
02:09:05,530 --> 02:09:08,033
and all will throughout the multiverse.

1064
02:09:08,199 --> 02:09:10,201
He found it hidden
on a primitive planet,

1065
02:09:10,285 --> 02:09:11,286
but before--

1066
02:09:11,369 --> 02:09:14,247
The story of the defiance is well-known.

1067
02:09:14,414 --> 02:09:16,917
| have found the primitive planet.

1068
02:09:17,083 --> 02:09:19,127
The world that fought back.

1069
02:09:19,294 --> 02:09:21,171
It is Earth.

1070
02:09:21,338 --> 02:09:23,548
The Anti-Life Equation is carved

1071
02:09:23,715 --> 02:09:27,594
into the surface of this very world.

1072
02:09:31,264 --> 02:09:32,682
Are you certain?

1073
02:09:32,849 --> 02:09:33,892
| have seen it.

1074
02:09:34,059 --> 02:09:37,437
| have looked with my own eyes.

1075
02:09:38,605 --> 02:09:40,065
Anti-life.

1076
02:10:20,814 --> 02:10:22,399
My lord.

1077
02:10:23,942 --> 02:10:27,487
Oh, Steppenwolf.

1078
02:10:28,154 --> 02:10:31,241
My lord,
| am but your humble servant.

1079
02:10:32,242 --> 02:10:35,078
Can it be true that you have found it?

1080
02:10:35,245 --> 02:10:37,414
I have, great one.

1081
02:10:38,164 --> 02:10:41,126
The lost world is Earth.

1082
02:10:41,292 --> 02:10:44,295
Anti-Life is here.

1083
02:10:45,630 --> 02:10:48,967
If it is redemption you seek,
find the third box,

1084
02:10:49,134 --> 02:10:52,095
synchronize The Unity,
and when this world is scorched,

1085
02:10:52,262 --> 02:10:55,473
| will come for my great prize.

1086
02:10:56,433 --> 02:10:58,643
You will come to Earth?

1087
02:10:59,686 --> 02:11:03,940
| have turned 100,000 worlds to dust

1088
02:11:04,107 --> 02:11:05,608
looking for Anti-Life.

1089
02:11:05,775 --> 02:11:08,987
Looking for those
who robbed me of my glory.

1090
02:11:09,154 --> 02:11:12,407
| will stride across their bones

1091
02:11:12,490 --> 02:11:14,909
and bask in the glow of Anti-Life.

1092
02:11:15,076 --> 02:11:17,787
And all of existence

1093
02:11:17,954 --> 02:11:21,416
shall be mine.

1094
02:11:24,836 --> 02:11:28,757
It shall be so, my master.

1095
02:11:32,969 --> 02:11:34,637
So cool.

1096
02:11:34,721 --> 02:11:35,722
From the outside,

1097
02:11:35,805 --> 02:11:37,348
it looks like this building
was abandoned.

1098
02:11:41,102 --> 02:11:42,854
It wants to fly.

1099
02:11:44,064 --> 02:11:45,940
You talk to machines?

1100
02:11:46,232 --> 02:11:48,234
I speak to intelligence.

1101
02:11:48,401 --> 02:11:51,279
This one's saying she can't fly
because of a software issue,

1102
02:11:51,446 --> 02:11:53,406
but I could fix it with a little time.

1103
02:12:03,166 --> 02:12:05,376
There's a dark spot in my data stream.

1104
02:12:05,710 --> 02:12:07,962
| could feel the other two boxes.

1105
02:12:08,129 --> 02:12:09,964
| know they're awake,

1106
02:12:10,131 --> 02:12:11,633
but I can't see where they are.

1107
02:12:11,800 --> 02:12:13,802
Well, we can't attack unless
we know where the base is.

1108
02:12:13,968 --> 02:12:16,221
Even if we knew,

1109
02:12:16,387 --> 02:12:19,224
I've never seen a being
as strong as Steppenwolf.

1110
02:12:21,434 --> 02:12:22,769
Maybe one.

1111
02:12:22,852 --> 02:12:24,562
Hmm, Superman.

1112
02:12:25,480 --> 02:12:27,148
As long
as the third box is asleep,

1113
02:12:27,232 --> 02:12:29,526
they can't see it, only sense it.

1114
02:12:29,692 --> 02:12:31,736
We need to keep moving
so they can't catch up.

1115
02:12:31,903 --> 02:12:35,073
No. That's just a strategy
to lose more slowly, not to win.

1116
02:12:35,698 --> 02:12:37,700
Remind me,
are flamethrowers not a thing?

1117
02:12:38,576 --> 02:12:39,661
Why don't we just destroy it?

1118
02:12:39,828 --> 02:12:41,913
Fire doesn't destroy the boxes.

1119
02:12:42,080 --> 02:12:43,790
They're an unknown form of matter.

1120
02:12:43,873 --> 02:12:45,166
Oh, they love heat.

1121
02:12:45,250 --> 02:12:47,460
They absorb it, hold it in their cores.

1122
02:12:47,627 --> 02:12:49,754
Well, you know a lot about these boxes.

1123
02:12:50,338 --> 02:12:51,589
Makes you think.

1124
02:12:51,756 --> 02:12:53,466
Where'd you find the box, Victor?

1125
02:12:54,425 --> 02:12:55,844
Are you trying to say something?

1126
02:12:56,136 --> 02:12:57,637
Oh, I'm saying it.

1127
02:12:58,221 --> 02:13:00,098
How do we know
you're not working for them?

1128
02:13:01,975 --> 02:13:03,643
It's a long story.

1129
02:13:04,102 --> 02:13:06,020
You got somewhere else to be?

1130
02:13:13,403 --> 02:13:17,240
The Nazis found the box
at the end of the Second World War,

1131
02:13:17,407 --> 02:13:20,451
buried under an Italian monastery.

1132
02:13:20,618 --> 02:13:22,996
The Allies intercepted it
on its way to Hitler.

1133
02:13:23,163 --> 02:13:25,373
They brought it back
to the States in '44.

1134
02:13:25,957 --> 02:13:29,502
Unknown object 6-1-9-8-2.

1135
02:13:30,378 --> 02:13:33,840
It collected dust
in the Pentagon archives for 70 years

1136
02:13:34,382 --> 02:13:37,594
till DoD began to study
the Superman ship.

1137
02:13:39,137 --> 02:13:41,556
A researcher at STARLABS
made a connection

1138
02:13:41,639 --> 02:13:42,640
between the ship...

1139
02:13:43,933 --> 02:13:45,476
and 6-1-9-8-2.

1140
02:13:46,352 --> 02:13:49,189
He understood
they were both alien technologies.

1141
02:13:49,856 --> 02:13:51,441
Different civilizations,

1142
02:13:52,025 --> 02:13:54,152
similar properties.

1143
02:13:55,486 --> 02:13:58,239
And though the box had slept
for thousands of years,

1144
02:13:58,907 --> 02:14:01,743
the researcher formulated
a theory on how to awaken it.

1145
02:14:02,368 --> 02:14:04,120
And so did.

1146
02:14:06,414 --> 02:14:07,415
Then...

1147
02:14:09,542 --> 02:14:11,461
| had an accident
that should've killed me.

1148
02:14:12,795 --> 02:14:16,007
But in an act of desperation
or madness,

1149
02:14:16,174 --> 02:14:18,509
the researcher harnessed
the power of the Mother Box.

1150
02:14:34,692 --> 02:14:36,778
He unleashed an alien technology

1151
02:14:36,945 --> 02:14:39,614
he didn't fully understand.

1152
02:14:39,781 --> 02:14:42,158
He used that power to keep me alive.

1153
02:14:45,745 --> 02:14:47,330
A life...

1154
02:14:47,872 --> 02:14:49,832
that turned into this.

1155
02:14:52,627 --> 02:14:54,921
The box went back to sleep

1156
02:14:55,838 --> 02:14:57,507
and he never returned it.

1157
02:15:00,134 --> 02:15:02,178
That researcher was Silas Stone.

1158
02:15:03,888 --> 02:15:05,556
My father.

1159
02:15:08,851 --> 02:15:10,520
Wait,

1160
02:15:10,687 --> 02:15:14,065
your father saved your life
with one of these things?

1161
02:15:14,232 --> 02:15:16,442
Aren't they psycho murder machines?

1162
02:15:16,609 --> 02:15:18,987
They're change machines.

1163
02:15:19,153 --> 02:15:21,823
The boxes don't think
in terms of healing or killing,

1164
02:15:22,240 --> 02:15:24,325
alive or dead.

1165
02:15:24,492 --> 02:15:26,744
They rearrange matter
at the will of their masters,

1166
02:15:26,911 --> 02:15:28,496
regenerate, reinstate.

1167
02:15:28,663 --> 02:15:30,081
Reinstate?

1168
02:15:30,164 --> 02:15:31,165
A box has the power

1169
02:15:31,249 --> 02:15:33,668
to reinstate anterior
particle relationships.

1170
02:15:33,835 --> 02:15:35,712
So, you mean in the way
that particles of matter

1171
02:15:35,795 --> 02:15:37,005
can't be created or destroyed,

1172
02:15:37,088 --> 02:15:39,090
their relations just transform.

1173
02:15:39,257 --> 02:15:42,010
Burn down a house,
the particles still exist.

1174
02:15:42,176 --> 02:15:44,637
Particles of house
become particles of smoke.

1175
02:15:44,804 --> 02:15:48,850
Anybody with a match
can turn a house to smoke.

1176
02:15:50,893 --> 02:15:52,645
But a Mother Box...

1177
02:15:52,812 --> 02:15:55,023
...turns smoke back into a house.

1178
02:16:01,029 --> 02:16:03,531
| know we're all thinking
the same thing right now.

1179
02:16:04,991 --> 02:16:07,493
Who's gonna say it?
I'm not gonna say it.

1180
02:16:34,771 --> 02:16:35,855
Who is it?

1181
02:16:36,564 --> 02:16:37,774
Martha.

1182
02:16:42,487 --> 02:16:43,738
Hi.

1183
02:16:45,615 --> 02:16:46,991
Hi.

1184
02:16:56,125 --> 02:16:57,668
| went to the Daily Planet

1185
02:16:57,752 --> 02:17:01,130
to finally pick up Clark's things.

1186
02:17:02,632 --> 02:17:05,927
| don't know why,
nowhere to put them now.

1187
02:17:08,721 --> 02:17:10,348
| lost the farm.

1188
02:17:11,974 --> 02:17:14,102
I'd been behind on the payments
for a while.

1189
02:17:15,478 --> 02:17:17,021
Truth is, the house is too big

1190
02:17:17,105 --> 02:17:19,357
for me to live in by myself anyway.

1191
02:17:19,899 --> 02:17:22,693
Well, you know you're welcome
to stay here any time

1192
02:17:22,860 --> 02:17:24,821
for as long as you need.

1193
02:17:26,030 --> 02:17:28,658
Thank you, Lois. That's very kind.

1194
02:17:30,326 --> 02:17:32,412
But I've found a little place
that suits me just fine,

1195
02:17:32,578 --> 02:17:34,038
right by the diner.

1196
02:17:34,664 --> 02:17:36,040
I'm not here for help.

1197
02:17:37,208 --> 02:17:39,085
I'm here because

1198
02:17:39,919 --> 02:17:42,338
when I saw Mr. Perry, he told me that

1199
02:17:43,798 --> 02:17:46,717
you haven't been to work
since Clark died.

1200
02:17:51,514 --> 02:17:53,141
| can't.

1201
02:18:00,022 --> 02:18:02,358
The whole world is mourning.

1202
02:18:03,985 --> 02:18:06,404
Grieving over a symbol.

1203
02:18:06,571 --> 02:18:10,366
Everywhere I go, everywhere I look,
| see that"S."

1204
02:18:11,492 --> 02:18:13,494
| hear what people say.

1205
02:18:13,661 --> 02:18:15,496
They talk like they knew him.

1206
02:18:16,706 --> 02:18:18,958
But they didn't know Clark.

1207
02:18:20,501 --> 02:18:22,837
And I can't stop them

1208
02:18:23,004 --> 02:18:24,380
and look at them and tell them

1209
02:18:24,547 --> 02:18:27,300
how proud I am of my son.

1210
02:18:29,302 --> 02:18:31,804
You're the only one who knows.

1211
02:18:31,971 --> 02:18:34,390
Who feels what I do.

1212
02:18:35,725 --> 02:18:38,686
Burdened by a secret on top of grief.

1213
02:18:41,856 --> 02:18:45,151
| came all this way because I wanted...

1214
02:18:45,318 --> 02:18:47,320
because I wanted to see you.

1215
02:18:48,571 --> 02:18:50,531
Tell you...

1216
02:18:50,698 --> 02:18:52,533
| understand.

1217
02:18:54,494 --> 02:18:55,536
I...

1218
02:18:56,829 --> 02:19:00,374
will never love anybody
the way that I love your son.

1219
02:19:04,128 --> 02:19:06,130
And I just miss him.

1220
02:19:07,298 --> 02:19:09,509
| miss him so much.

1221
02:19:16,224 --> 02:19:17,892
So do |, sweetheart.

1222
02:19:22,480 --> 02:19:27,360
Martha, you know if there's
anything you need, I'm here.

1223
02:19:30,947 --> 02:19:33,533
There is something
you can do for me, honey.

1224
02:19:35,952 --> 02:19:38,204
Come back to the living.

1225
02:20:18,202 --> 02:20:21,038
The world needs you, too, Lois.

1226
02:20:24,834 --> 02:20:26,002
The dead are dead.

1227
02:20:26,335 --> 02:20:28,087
The box brought Victor back.

1228
02:20:28,254 --> 02:20:29,797
Victor wasn't dead.

1229
02:20:29,964 --> 02:20:31,716
Life is either one or zero.

1230
02:20:31,882 --> 02:20:34,802
It's to be or not to be. Not both.

1231
02:20:34,969 --> 02:20:36,596
Can you operate this box, Victor?

1232
02:20:36,679 --> 02:20:37,680
Of course.

1233
02:20:38,097 --> 02:20:40,516
But we don't know enough
about Kryptonian biology.

1234
02:20:40,683 --> 02:20:42,518
There's no telling what's gonna happen.

1235
02:20:44,478 --> 02:20:45,980
- Okay, but...

1236
02:20:46,147 --> 02:20:49,775
| mean, we have to try.
Don't we? We have to try.

1237
02:20:50,401 --> 02:20:51,485
What do we have to lose?

1238
02:20:51,652 --> 02:20:54,196
We cannot try
unless we activate the box.

1239
02:20:54,363 --> 02:20:55,823
As soon as it wakes up...

1240
02:20:55,990 --> 02:20:58,367
...the enemy sees it, comes,

1241
02:20:58,534 --> 02:21:01,078
activates The Unity. The end.

1242
02:21:01,245 --> 02:21:03,623
So, what we have to lose
is the entire planet

1243
02:21:03,789 --> 02:21:05,833
to a bunch of genocidal aliens.
That's good to know.

1244
02:21:05,916 --> 02:21:08,419
Even if Superman could return,

1245
02:21:08,586 --> 02:21:10,463
who's to say that he could defeat them?

1246
02:21:10,630 --> 02:21:12,506
The Mother Box did.

1247
02:21:12,798 --> 02:21:16,135
Victor's father activated a Mother Box
more than a year ago.

1248
02:21:16,218 --> 02:21:17,970
When Superman was still alive.

1249
02:21:18,137 --> 02:21:20,014
Didn't call out to Steppenwolf.

1250
02:21:20,097 --> 02:21:21,557
None of the boxes did. Not until...

1251
02:21:21,724 --> 02:21:23,809
Not until Superman died.

1252
02:21:23,976 --> 02:21:26,395
Not until Superman died.

1253
02:21:26,562 --> 02:21:28,522
It's like they were afraid of him?

1254
02:21:28,606 --> 02:21:31,484
Yes, they were afraid of him.

1255
02:21:34,403 --> 02:21:36,197
This is the only way.

1256
02:21:37,865 --> 02:21:41,619
There are six, not five.
There is no us without him.

1257
02:22:09,021 --> 02:22:10,981
Cross this one off
the bucket list.

1258
02:22:11,148 --> 02:22:14,944
Exhume Superman from the grave. Check.

1259
02:22:16,987 --> 02:22:19,407
You know we could do this
IN a nanosecond, right?

1260
02:22:20,116 --> 02:22:21,492
We could.

1261
02:22:29,041 --> 02:22:30,668
He was my hero.

1262
02:22:33,295 --> 02:22:34,505
All right.

1263
02:22:38,134 --> 02:22:41,178
An Amazon working with an Atlantean.

1264
02:22:41,345 --> 02:22:42,596
Half-Atlantean.

1265
02:22:44,473 --> 02:22:47,226
How many thousands of years
since our people spoke?

1266
02:22:47,893 --> 02:22:50,771
| don't know.
I'm not exactly close to mine.

1267
02:22:51,981 --> 02:22:54,692
| hate Atlanteans
as much as you Amazons do.

1268
02:22:54,859 --> 02:22:56,902
Hate is useless.

1269
02:23:00,030 --> 02:23:01,365
Yep.

1270
02:23:02,658 --> 02:23:04,243
No, thank you.

1271
02:23:08,789 --> 02:23:11,751
You know, my father told me
there's a saying in Atlantis...

1272
02:23:13,502 --> 02:23:15,713
"None are taken back from the darkness.

1273
02:23:15,796 --> 02:23:18,591
-"Not without..."
-"Not without giving one up in return."

1274
02:23:20,843 --> 02:23:22,428
We say the same thing.

1275
02:23:25,055 --> 02:23:26,390
How about that?

1276
02:23:26,891 --> 02:23:28,768
Wonder Woman.

1277
02:23:30,144 --> 02:23:31,145
What do you think, man?

1278
02:23:31,228 --> 02:23:34,106
You think she'd ever go
for a younger guy?

1279
02:23:34,482 --> 02:23:37,067
She's 5,000 years old, Barry.

1280
02:23:38,944 --> 02:23:40,780
Every guy's a younger guy.

1281
02:23:42,782 --> 02:23:43,866
Jesus.

1282
02:23:45,367 --> 02:23:47,077
Oh, Christ.

1283
02:23:49,622 --> 02:23:52,041
-Oh, bloody...

1284
02:23:53,417 --> 02:23:54,418
Any luck?

1285
02:23:54,585 --> 02:23:55,669
If by "luck" you mean

1286
02:23:55,836 --> 02:23:58,923
"chance in hell
we'll get it flying today,"

1287
02:23:59,089 --> 02:24:01,091
then, no. No luck.

1288
02:24:01,967 --> 02:24:03,511
It's okay.

1289
02:24:03,677 --> 02:24:05,387
It doesn't matter.
We're just gonna take the body

1290
02:24:05,554 --> 02:24:06,555
to the Kryptonian ship.

1291
02:24:06,639 --> 02:24:07,807
It's basically an organic computer.

1292
02:24:07,973 --> 02:24:09,975
It can talk directly to the Mother Box.

1293
02:24:10,142 --> 02:24:12,603
What? The way it talked to Lex Luthor?

1294
02:24:12,770 --> 02:24:13,813
Something like that.

1295
02:24:13,979 --> 02:24:17,817
Huh.
What could possibly go wrong?

1296
02:24:24,448 --> 02:24:25,950
Master Wayne...

1297
02:24:28,035 --> 02:24:29,245
you did it!

1298
02:24:29,620 --> 02:24:32,915
You put the team together
to fight this war.

1299
02:24:33,207 --> 02:24:35,417
You've fulfilled your promise.

1300
02:24:36,502 --> 02:24:39,922
But to try to do that... I mean...

1301
02:24:40,548 --> 02:24:42,383
your guilt's overcome your reason.

1302
02:24:43,592 --> 02:24:45,719
Not all the king's horses
nor all the king's men...

1303
02:24:45,886 --> 02:24:48,973
Alfred, for once,
I'm operating strictly on faith,

1304
02:24:49,139 --> 02:24:50,975
not on reason.

1305
02:24:51,767 --> 02:24:55,980
But if you start playing
with this little box of tricks,

1306
02:24:56,146 --> 02:24:58,232
| mean, it could be
the end of everything.

1307
02:24:58,399 --> 02:25:00,276
How do you know
your team's strong enough?

1308
02:25:01,527 --> 02:25:03,863
If you can't bring down
the charging bull,

1309
02:25:04,029 --> 02:25:05,739
then don't wave the red cape at it.

1310
02:25:05,906 --> 02:25:07,491
You do when it's this red cape.

1311
02:25:07,658 --> 02:25:09,827
This red cape charges back.

1312
02:25:24,550 --> 02:25:25,718
Okay.

1313
02:25:32,683 --> 02:25:35,060
You were right, Dr. Stone.
The tests came back negative.

1314
02:25:35,227 --> 02:25:36,854
Everyone's clear, including you.

1315
02:25:37,021 --> 02:25:39,607
Just to be on the safe side,
we swept the entire facility.

1316
02:25:39,773 --> 02:25:41,442
Well, thank you, Thomas.
That means I'm free to go?

1317
02:25:41,525 --> 02:25:42,526
Absolutely.

1318
02:25:46,530 --> 02:25:47,823
-Thanks.
-Listen up, everyone.

1319
02:25:47,990 --> 02:25:50,451
You're all clear.
So, gather your things.

1320
02:25:50,618 --> 02:25:52,161
If you need more medical attention...

1321
02:25:52,328 --> 02:25:55,998
Arthur, yes, your opinion.
Less preposterous. Option "A"?

1322
02:25:56,165 --> 02:25:57,416
-Definitely not "A."
-Okay.

1323
02:25:57,583 --> 02:26:00,711
Or..."B"?

1324
02:26:02,338 --> 02:26:03,589
Let me see "A" again?

1325
02:26:09,219 --> 02:26:12,348
Right. We should get dressed.

1326
02:26:14,475 --> 02:26:16,435
I'm always dressed.

1327
02:26:43,587 --> 02:26:44,588
ID?

1328
02:26:44,838 --> 02:26:46,006
ID.

1329
02:26:49,176 --> 02:26:50,302
Aye, aye.

1330
02:26:52,638 --> 02:26:53,847
"Aye, aye"?

1331
02:27:17,079 --> 02:27:18,414
Okay.

1332
02:27:18,580 --> 02:27:20,666
"Okay"? Oh, gee, okay!

1333
02:27:27,631 --> 02:27:28,716
Doc!

1334
02:27:28,882 --> 02:27:30,092
They let you out of quarantine.

1335
02:27:30,175 --> 02:27:31,635
Yeah, I finally got them
to listen to reason.

1336
02:27:31,719 --> 02:27:33,971
Now, let's take a look and see
what progress we've made

1337
02:27:34,138 --> 02:27:35,139
with the electron-laser.

1338
02:27:35,305 --> 02:27:37,641
We've made some real progress.
Let me show you.

1339
02:27:52,740 --> 02:27:55,242
Victor, clear this place out.

1340
02:27:55,576 --> 02:27:56,827
Done.

1341
02:28:01,040 --> 02:28:03,709
Code Red.
Contamination breach.

1342
02:28:03,792 --> 02:28:07,129
All personnel evacuate immediately.

1343
02:28:07,212 --> 02:28:09,339
- Bio red five.

1344
02:28:09,506 --> 02:28:11,884
The sensor's picking up
a microbe of alien origin.

1345
02:28:12,051 --> 02:28:14,678
A microbe of alien origin?
That doesn't make any sense.

1346
02:28:14,845 --> 02:28:15,846
It's gotta be a false alarm.

1347
02:28:16,013 --> 02:28:18,390
All right, people, shut it down.
Let's go.

1348
02:28:18,474 --> 02:28:19,892
-Ryan, we just had it swept.
-We have to go, Doc.

1349
02:28:19,975 --> 02:28:21,268
Think about it.
It's gotta be a false alarm.

1350
02:28:21,351 --> 02:28:22,352
-Let's go, Doc.
-Think about it.

1351
02:28:22,436 --> 02:28:23,771
Full base evacuation!
Everyone out!

1352
02:28:23,854 --> 02:28:26,106
Look, wait! Wait! Shit!

1353
02:28:26,273 --> 02:28:29,026
Remain calm
and proceed to the nearest exit.

1354
02:28:35,491 --> 02:28:37,201
Attention, all personnel.

1355
02:28:37,367 --> 02:28:40,162
Go! Go! Everybody out!
Come on! Move!

1356
02:28:40,329 --> 02:28:41,955
Move! Come on! Go, go!

1357
02:28:42,122 --> 02:28:43,624
Everybody out! Go!

1358
02:29:04,061 --> 02:29:06,647
-Yes! Gotcha!

1359
02:29:07,022 --> 02:29:09,691
Post Commander, this is Dr. Silas Stone,
do you read?

1360
02:29:09,858 --> 02:29:12,319
- Go ahead, Dr. Stone.
-This is a false alarm.

1361
02:29:12,486 --> 02:29:15,030
Someone has hacked into the system.
We must alert...

1362
02:29:24,998 --> 02:29:26,416
Victor.

1363
02:29:28,168 --> 02:29:30,337
Dr. Stone, you there?
I don't copy.

1364
02:29:31,380 --> 02:29:32,381
| was mistaken.

1365
02:29:32,548 --> 02:29:33,757
The alarm's legit.

1366
02:29:33,924 --> 02:29:35,509
Everybody out.
And nobody, I repeat,

1367
02:29:35,676 --> 02:29:38,428
nobody comes back inside
without my say-so.

1368
02:29:38,595 --> 02:29:39,847
Roger that, sir.

1369
02:29:50,482 --> 02:29:51,525
Get the civilians out!

1370
02:29:51,859 --> 02:29:52,860
Let's go! Let's go!

1371
02:29:57,281 --> 02:29:58,574
-Everybody got out okay?
-I think so.

1372
02:29:58,657 --> 02:29:59,658
-Everybody?
-Yes.

1373
02:30:32,983 --> 02:30:34,234
This way.

1374
02:30:44,828 --> 02:30:46,788
It knows he's here.

1375
02:30:47,956 --> 02:30:49,958
Ooh, that's intense.

1376
02:30:54,421 --> 02:30:56,298
This is amazing.

1377
02:30:57,132 --> 02:30:58,342
This is crazy.

1378
02:30:58,508 --> 02:31:00,385
Oh, what? Now it's crazy?

1379
02:31:00,552 --> 02:31:02,930
You two lunatics
better know what you're doing.

1380
02:33:28,909 --> 02:33:30,744
Systems coming online.

1381
02:33:33,663 --> 02:33:35,374
Welcome, Victor.

1382
02:33:36,124 --> 02:33:37,834
Would you like to assume command?

1383
02:33:37,918 --> 02:33:38,919
I'm In.

1384
02:33:48,345 --> 02:33:50,555
The ship says the Mother Box is hostile.

1385
02:33:50,722 --> 02:33:52,391
| can override the security protocols,

1386
02:33:52,557 --> 02:33:54,184
but there's no time to repair
all the electrical damage

1387
02:33:54,351 --> 02:33:56,728
that Luthor's power surges caused
to the primary capacitors.

1388
02:33:56,812 --> 02:33:57,979
English.

1389
02:33:58,146 --> 02:34:00,190
There's not enough charge
to wake the box.

1390
02:34:00,690 --> 02:34:02,567
| might be able to do it.

1391
02:34:04,903 --> 02:34:06,822
| mean, I might be able
to jump-start it.

1392
02:34:06,988 --> 02:34:08,031
| don't like to break this rule,

1393
02:34:08,198 --> 02:34:10,117
but when I approach
the speed of light, I...

1394
02:34:10,283 --> 02:34:11,785
Look, crazy things happen to time,

1395
02:34:11,952 --> 02:34:14,538
but if I do it,
| create massive electrical power.

1396
02:34:14,704 --> 02:34:16,456
| could backtrack,
if I can get enough distance,

1397
02:34:16,623 --> 02:34:18,792
| can conduct
a significant electrical current.

1398
02:34:18,959 --> 02:34:21,294
| might be able to wake the box,
if that's...

1399
02:34:21,711 --> 02:34:23,296
still what we want?

1400
02:34:23,463 --> 02:34:24,881
It is. Do it.

1401
02:34:29,719 --> 02:34:30,929
Hey, Miss Lane.

1402
02:34:31,012 --> 02:34:32,013
Morning.

1403
02:34:32,097 --> 02:34:33,348
| didn't think you were coming.

1404
02:34:34,474 --> 02:34:35,976
One last time.

1405
02:34:53,118 --> 02:34:56,496
| see engines, so this must be
the end of the line. So I'm...

1406
02:34:56,997 --> 02:34:58,039
I'm in position.

1407
02:35:00,959 --> 02:35:03,044
Ready to initiate
drop sequence.

1408
02:35:03,503 --> 02:35:05,130
The Mother Box is ready.

1409
02:35:24,649 --> 02:35:26,485
The ship's begging me
not to wake the box.

1410
02:35:26,568 --> 02:35:27,861
This action is irreversible.

1411
02:35:27,944 --> 02:35:29,779
It's afraid.
It knows Steppenwolf will come for it.

1412
02:35:29,863 --> 02:35:31,615
We know that already. Continue.

1413
02:35:31,948 --> 02:35:34,409
I strongly advise
against activation.

1414
02:35:34,576 --> 02:35:36,119
Barry, I'm initiating the countdown.

1415
02:35:36,286 --> 02:35:37,954
This action is irreversible.

1416
02:35:38,038 --> 02:35:39,164
-Five...
- Five...

1417
02:35:39,247 --> 02:35:40,415
-Five...
- Apokoliptian technology

1418
02:35:40,499 --> 02:35:41,500
-is hostile.
-This is a bad idea.

1419
02:35:41,583 --> 02:35:42,584
No, it isn't. Keep going.

1420
02:35:42,667 --> 02:35:43,668
Four...

1421
02:35:43,752 --> 02:35:44,753
- Four...
-Four...

1422
02:35:44,836 --> 02:35:46,004
I strongly advise
against activation.

1423
02:35:46,087 --> 02:35:48,006
-We need to abort, now.
-Just do it.

1424
02:35:48,340 --> 02:35:49,341
- Three...
- Three...

1425
02:35:49,508 --> 02:35:50,509
Three...

1426
02:35:50,592 --> 02:35:52,511
-Two...
- Two...

1427
02:35:52,677 --> 02:35:54,387
-Two...
-This course is irreversible.

1428
02:35:54,471 --> 02:35:55,680
-One.
- One.

1429
02:35:56,723 --> 02:35:59,518
-One.
- This action is irreversible.

1430
02:37:28,440 --> 02:37:30,025
- Victor?
-No.

1431
02:37:31,067 --> 02:37:31,901
Go?

1432
02:39:02,617 --> 02:39:05,537
The future
has taken root in the present.

1433
02:39:05,620 --> 02:39:07,247
-Get down!

1434
02:40:51,351 --> 02:40:52,894
He's back.

1435
02:41:19,921 --> 02:41:22,632
Something's wrong.
He's scanning us.

1436
02:41:24,759 --> 02:41:26,177
What?

1437
02:41:41,192 --> 02:41:42,193
Victor?

1438
02:41:43,486 --> 02:41:44,487
Victor?

1439
02:41:46,781 --> 02:41:48,324
-Shit.
-What are you doing?

1440
02:41:48,783 --> 02:41:50,326
It's my auto-defense system.

1441
02:41:50,493 --> 02:41:51,536
It senses danger.

1442
02:41:51,703 --> 02:41:52,871
Victor, no! Victor!

1443
02:41:53,037 --> 02:41:54,873
-I can't control it.
- Don't!

1444
02:42:07,302 --> 02:42:08,469
Kal-El, no!

1445
02:42:16,853 --> 02:42:18,813
He's confused.
He doesn't know who he is.

1446
02:42:25,987 --> 02:42:28,615
Arthur, we need to restrain him.

1447
02:42:59,187 --> 02:43:02,815
Kal-El, the last Son of Krypton...

1448
02:43:03,900 --> 02:43:06,110
remember who you are.

1449
02:43:07,737 --> 02:43:09,113
Tell me who you...

1450
02:44:43,958 --> 02:44:47,003
Let's go!

1451
02:44:54,218 --> 02:44:55,845
You should probably move.

1452
02:44:59,140 --> 02:45:00,141
-You all right?
-Yeah.

1453
02:45:00,308 --> 02:45:02,769
Get up. Take cover back there. Go.

1454
02:45:55,196 --> 02:45:57,240
Please don't make me do this.

1455
02:46:29,939 --> 02:46:31,065
Clark.

1456
02:46:32,150 --> 02:46:33,317
Clark, no.

1457
02:46:44,871 --> 02:46:45,872
Clark.

1458
02:46:46,289 --> 02:46:47,456
No.

1459
02:46:48,291 --> 02:46:50,042
This world needs you.

1460
02:46:55,256 --> 02:46:56,257
Clark.

1461
02:46:56,632 --> 02:46:57,842
Clark.

1462
02:46:57,925 --> 02:46:59,969
Whoa! Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

1463
02:47:01,596 --> 02:47:02,722
Clark.

1464
02:47:06,100 --> 02:47:07,476
Please.

1465
02:47:41,719 --> 02:47:42,845
Please.

1466
02:47:54,065 --> 02:47:55,233
Please.

1467
02:47:55,983 --> 02:47:57,777
Just go.

1468
02:47:58,236 --> 02:47:59,237
Yeah.

1469
02:48:00,112 --> 02:48:01,405
Let's go.

1470
02:48:33,980 --> 02:48:35,982
I'm so sorry.

1471
02:48:45,366 --> 02:48:46,075
Take cover!

1472
02:48:46,617 --> 02:48:49,120
-He's coming.
-The Mother Box.

1473
02:48:49,287 --> 02:48:50,329
Where is it?

1474
02:49:01,048 --> 02:49:02,258
Come on.

1475
02:49:03,175 --> 02:49:04,468
Come on.

1476
02:49:29,994 --> 02:49:33,039
Attention, security breach detected.

1477
02:49:33,622 --> 02:49:35,791
Sector Four, Level Three.

1478
02:49:35,958 --> 02:49:38,753
Implement lockdown procedures
immediately.

1479
02:50:07,323 --> 02:50:08,908
Give me the Mother Box.

1480
02:50:22,088 --> 02:50:23,506
No, no, no.

1481
02:50:26,050 --> 02:50:27,760
Dad, wait! Don't!

1482
02:51:08,092 --> 02:51:10,970
So begins the end.

1483
02:51:16,725 --> 02:51:18,018
Victor?

1484
02:51:20,563 --> 02:51:23,691
Vic... Whoa, Victor.
Are you okay, man? Come on.

1485
02:51:29,697 --> 02:51:30,865
Victor?

1486
02:51:31,991 --> 02:51:33,451
He's dead.

1487
02:51:33,617 --> 02:51:34,618
What?

1488
02:51:35,703 --> 02:51:36,912
My father.

1489
02:51:38,372 --> 02:51:41,333
| didn't save him. I couldn't.

1490
02:51:42,126 --> 02:51:43,419
Oh, my God.

1491
02:51:50,342 --> 02:51:52,428
His father's dead 'cause of us.

1492
02:51:52,595 --> 02:51:54,054
| told you waking that box
was a bad idea.

1493
02:51:54,221 --> 02:51:55,806
It wasn't a bad idea.

1494
02:51:55,973 --> 02:51:58,309
We needed Superman.
We still do.

1495
02:51:58,476 --> 02:52:00,769
Well, whatever returned,
it isn't Superman.

1496
02:52:00,936 --> 02:52:03,939
His body and powers, maybe.
But it ain't him.

1497
02:52:04,106 --> 02:52:05,733
It is him.

1498
02:52:05,900 --> 02:52:08,027
He recognized Lois Lane.

1499
02:52:08,402 --> 02:52:10,321
-Who?
-The woman he loves.

1500
02:52:10,696 --> 02:52:12,698
-He remembers her.
- Nah.

1501
02:52:13,240 --> 02:52:14,992
He went to her
'cause she wasn't afraid of him.

1502
02:52:15,159 --> 02:52:16,577
It's called instinct, Diana.

1503
02:52:24,001 --> 02:52:25,836
Wait,
where did Steppenwolf go?

1504
02:52:26,003 --> 02:52:27,588
He's gone back to his base

1505
02:52:27,671 --> 02:52:29,340
to assemble the three boxes.

1506
02:52:29,507 --> 02:52:30,966
And we don't know
where his base is.

1507
02:52:31,050 --> 02:52:32,593
-Or how long until--
- Hours.

1508
02:52:32,760 --> 02:52:34,428
The boxes synchronize, Unity forms,

1509
02:52:34,595 --> 02:52:36,847
we don't get there in time
to stop it, the planet dies.

1510
02:52:37,765 --> 02:52:39,433
This is not your...

1511
02:52:41,977 --> 02:52:43,479
He knew.

1512
02:52:43,771 --> 02:52:45,356
He knew, he knew, he knew.

1513
02:52:45,523 --> 02:52:46,941
He wasn't trying to destroy the box...

1514
02:52:47,358 --> 02:52:49,276
he was trying to superheat it.

1515
02:52:49,443 --> 02:52:50,819
He made the core the hottest thing

1516
02:52:50,903 --> 02:52:51,987
on Earth outside of a nuclear reactor.

1517
02:52:52,071 --> 02:52:53,239
Now, anything that hot would have to--

1518
02:52:53,322 --> 02:52:54,323
Blink off the charts

1519
02:52:54,490 --> 02:52:56,700
on a thermal imaging system.

1520
02:52:56,867 --> 02:53:00,246
Your father sacrificed himself
to mark that box.

1521
02:53:00,412 --> 02:53:02,289
We have to get back to my lab
and use the satellite

1522
02:53:02,456 --> 02:53:04,458
to scan the Earth for thermal anomalies.

1523
02:53:04,625 --> 02:53:05,751
I'm already on it.

1524
02:53:05,918 --> 02:53:07,920
I'm sorry.
You have a satellite?

1525
02:53:08,087 --> 02:53:09,088
| have six.

1526
02:53:09,588 --> 02:53:10,631
Right.

1527
02:53:12,424 --> 02:53:14,426
Let's go find the son of a bitch.

1528
02:53:38,993 --> 02:53:41,078
You brought us here.

1529
02:53:41,245 --> 02:53:42,413
You remembered.

1530
02:53:43,330 --> 02:53:44,957
This is home.

1531
02:53:46,875 --> 02:53:48,085
You spoke.

1532
02:53:52,131 --> 02:53:54,008
Did I not before?

1533
02:54:28,000 --> 02:54:30,544
Your mother got behind on the payments.

1534
02:54:32,046 --> 02:54:34,048
She never told anyone.

1535
02:54:35,716 --> 02:54:37,468
| don't understand.

1536
02:54:40,554 --> 02:54:42,973
She's a proud woman, Clark.

1537
02:54:46,101 --> 02:54:47,478
Here.

1538
02:55:02,409 --> 02:55:04,078
She loved it here.

1539
02:55:14,880 --> 02:55:16,507
So did I.

1540
02:55:18,509 --> 02:55:19,927
So did I.

1541
02:55:45,577 --> 02:55:46,870
Wow!

1542
02:55:47,037 --> 02:55:48,664
This is awesome.

1543
02:55:48,831 --> 02:55:50,332
Brought some friends.

1544
02:55:56,880 --> 02:55:59,466
Oh, gosh, yes! Yes!

1545
02:55:59,633 --> 02:56:02,136
Everyone, this is Alfred.
| work for him.

1546
02:56:02,302 --> 02:56:04,513
-Alfred.
-Good day, ma'am.

1547
02:56:06,515 --> 02:56:07,599
Oh...

1548
02:56:10,978 --> 02:56:12,855
It's badass, Alfred.

1549
02:56:15,649 --> 02:56:18,068
Well, I'll put on the tea.

1550
02:56:18,235 --> 02:56:19,236
Great.

1551
02:56:19,403 --> 02:56:21,238
| don't know where
we're gonna find the cups.

1552
02:56:24,158 --> 02:56:26,994
There's the Mother Box,
right there.

1553
02:56:27,161 --> 02:56:28,954
Go to visible spectrum.

1554
02:56:30,998 --> 02:56:32,666
Pozharnov.

1555
02:56:33,250 --> 02:56:36,086
Ghost city not far from Moscow.

1556
02:56:36,253 --> 02:56:37,254
It's been abandoned since

1557
02:56:37,337 --> 02:56:38,922
the nuclear accident there
30 years ago.

1558
02:56:39,089 --> 02:56:40,299
Not even the army goes in.

1559
02:56:40,466 --> 02:56:41,759
Right,
it's probably so radioactive

1560
02:56:41,925 --> 02:56:44,094
that you grow an extra foot
outta your neck.

1561
02:56:44,178 --> 02:56:45,179
Not anymore.

1562
02:56:45,262 --> 02:56:47,264
He's harvested the radiation
to build his base.

1563
02:56:47,347 --> 02:56:48,390
Zoom.

1564
02:56:52,436 --> 02:56:53,812
What the hell is he building?

1565
02:56:53,979 --> 02:56:55,230
The Unity's in there.

1566
02:56:55,397 --> 02:56:56,815
We'll attack from above.

1567
02:56:56,982 --> 02:56:59,568
Explosives won't separate the boxes,

1568
02:56:59,735 --> 02:57:01,570
only strengthen their bond.

1569
02:57:01,737 --> 02:57:02,863
What?
So we can't blow it up?

1570
02:57:03,030 --> 02:57:04,490
Not from the outside.

1571
02:57:06,074 --> 02:57:08,452
| want to plug into The Unity,
one-on-one.

1572
02:57:09,161 --> 02:57:10,579
Fuse with it.

1573
02:57:10,746 --> 02:57:11,997
Weaken its bond from the inside

1574
02:57:12,080 --> 02:57:13,290
SO we can break it back into three.

1575
02:57:13,457 --> 02:57:15,667
No, you don't know
what you'd be up against.

1576
02:57:15,834 --> 02:57:19,379
You'd have to stream
into The Unity by yourself.

1577
02:57:19,546 --> 02:57:21,882
These boxes together
are world destroyers.

1578
02:57:22,049 --> 02:57:23,467
A billion years old.

1579
02:57:23,634 --> 02:57:25,761
They'll get inside you
and find your weaknesses

1580
02:57:25,928 --> 02:57:28,096
and your fears,
and use them to destroy you.

1581
02:57:28,263 --> 02:57:30,265
Just get me in and get me time.

1582
02:57:30,516 --> 02:57:31,683
You could die, Victor.

1583
02:57:31,850 --> 02:57:34,144
If I don't, we all die. Period.

1584
02:57:38,899 --> 02:57:40,651
| got nothing left.

1585
02:57:46,031 --> 02:57:47,991
You wanted me to use these gifts, right?

1586
02:57:51,078 --> 02:57:52,579
That's what I'm gonna do.

1587
02:57:52,746 --> 02:57:54,623
Okay. So...

1588
02:57:55,332 --> 02:57:56,959
if Victor wants to try to save the world

1589
02:57:57,042 --> 02:57:58,585
by fusing with the doom boxes,

1590
02:57:58,794 --> 02:58:00,963
| say we put him in the doom boxes.

1591
02:58:01,296 --> 02:58:04,091
But getting him in
means attacking that base.

1592
02:58:04,258 --> 02:58:06,468
Fighting the devil and his army

1593
02:58:06,635 --> 02:58:07,678
in hell.

1594
02:58:07,845 --> 02:58:10,097
I mean,
this guy's probably fought

1595
02:58:10,264 --> 02:58:12,599
hundreds of thousands
of other superbeings

1596
02:58:12,683 --> 02:58:14,226
on the other planets
he's destroyed, right?

1597
02:58:14,393 --> 02:58:15,894
And we have to assume he's won.

1598
02:58:16,061 --> 02:58:19,189
| don't care how many demons he's fought
in how many hells...

1599
02:58:19,356 --> 02:58:22,860
he's never fought us. Not us united.

1600
02:59:13,327 --> 02:59:14,953
Take that as a "yes."

1601
02:59:15,078 --> 02:59:16,413
What?

1602
02:59:19,875 --> 02:59:21,126
The ring.

1603
02:59:24,838 --> 02:59:26,381
You're really back.

1604
02:59:59,873 --> 03:00:02,084
| have a second chance, Lo.

1605
03:00:04,378 --> 03:00:06,838
And I am not gonna waste it.

1606
03:01:05,105 --> 03:01:06,273
Are you really you?

1607
03:01:06,440 --> 03:01:08,150
I'm really me, Ma.

1608
03:01:26,168 --> 03:01:28,211
Listen, Ma.

1609
03:01:29,796 --> 03:01:31,840
They wanted me back for a reason.

1610
03:01:33,592 --> 03:01:35,135
| need to find out why.

1611
03:01:55,280 --> 03:01:56,698
How's Victor doing?

1612
03:02:01,078 --> 03:02:03,830
You know, wanted to be by himself.

1613
03:02:05,415 --> 03:02:08,585
We're asking a kid
who just lost his father

1614
03:02:08,752 --> 03:02:10,253
to go up against
the most powerful machines

1615
03:02:10,337 --> 03:02:11,546
in the universe.

1616
03:02:13,381 --> 03:02:14,883
It's not fair.

1617
03:02:16,635 --> 03:02:18,261
| thought you didn't care?

1618
03:02:19,679 --> 03:02:21,181
| never said that.

1619
03:02:34,111 --> 03:02:35,529
What is it?

1620
03:02:37,322 --> 03:02:38,698
Uh...

1621
03:02:39,449 --> 03:02:42,452
| had a dream, like, I don't know,

1622
03:02:42,536 --> 03:02:44,454
almost like a premonition.

1623
03:02:45,413 --> 03:02:48,208
It was the end of the world

1624
03:02:48,375 --> 03:02:51,211
and Barry Allen was right here

1625
03:02:51,378 --> 03:02:55,257
and he said to me,
"Lois Lane is the key."

1626
03:02:57,926 --> 03:03:01,138
She is... to Superman.

1627
03:03:02,180 --> 03:03:03,807
Every heart has one.

1628
03:03:04,432 --> 03:03:06,309
| think it's something more.

1629
03:03:07,185 --> 03:03:09,062
Something darker.

1630
03:03:13,233 --> 03:03:14,234
Master Wayne.

1631
03:03:14,401 --> 03:03:15,902
Master Wayne!

1632
03:03:16,736 --> 03:03:18,405
You need to see this.

1633
03:03:41,678 --> 03:03:43,388
You fixed it.

1634
03:03:43,555 --> 03:03:45,265
It wanted to fly.

1635
03:03:46,516 --> 03:03:47,851
Flight is its nature.

1636
03:03:48,018 --> 03:03:49,311
Yours, too.

1637
03:03:56,109 --> 03:03:58,069
He'll be here, Alfred, I know it.

1638
03:03:58,236 --> 03:03:59,863
What makes you so sure?

1639
03:04:00,614 --> 03:04:03,200
Faith, Alfred. Faith.

1640
03:04:25,305 --> 03:04:26,890
At last.

1641
03:04:28,725 --> 03:04:31,436
Prepare for his arrival.

1642
03:04:33,271 --> 03:04:37,400
My redemption is nigh.

1643
03:04:45,283 --> 03:04:46,743
Unite.

1644
03:04:51,915 --> 03:04:54,417
Synchronize.

1645
03:05:38,753 --> 03:05:41,673
The satellites revealed
he's created a defensive dome.

1646
03:05:41,840 --> 03:05:43,008
It's a design flaw.

1647
03:05:43,174 --> 03:05:45,427
Take out the tower, the dome will fall.

1648
03:05:45,593 --> 03:05:47,595
The enemy never anticipated
a frontal assault.

1649
03:05:47,762 --> 03:05:49,264
Right,
probably 'cause he didn't think

1650
03:05:49,347 --> 03:05:51,266
anyone would be that nuts.

1651
03:05:52,267 --> 03:05:53,560
Bruce is right.

1652
03:05:53,727 --> 03:05:55,312
We've got to destroy
the defensive dome

1653
03:05:55,478 --> 03:05:57,772
so we can reach The Unity
before it synchronizes.

1654
03:05:57,939 --> 03:05:59,649
What if the dome's not destroyed?

1655
03:05:59,816 --> 03:06:00,817
It'll be destroyed.

1656
03:06:00,984 --> 03:06:02,610
Once Victor is linked with The Unity

1657
03:06:03,111 --> 03:06:04,321
with Barry's help,

1658
03:06:04,404 --> 03:06:06,364
he'll break through
The Unity's defenses.

1659
03:06:06,531 --> 03:06:07,991
Remind me, how's that again?

1660
03:06:08,158 --> 03:06:09,784
Uh, with the power of love.

1661
03:06:09,951 --> 03:06:12,579
-Barry.
-With a catastrophic energy surge.

1662
03:06:12,746 --> 03:06:13,747
Good.

1663
03:06:13,913 --> 03:06:15,790
You'll have to run faster
than you've ever attempted

1664
03:06:15,957 --> 03:06:18,126
to generate a charge of that size.

1665
03:06:18,668 --> 03:06:20,670
And then you make
physical contact with Victor.

1666
03:06:21,004 --> 03:06:23,882
That force should propel him
inside The Unity.

1667
03:06:24,049 --> 03:06:25,925
And, Victor, it's all up to you.

1668
03:06:26,092 --> 03:06:28,845
Take it apart from the inside
before it synchronizes.

1669
03:06:29,512 --> 03:06:32,557
Whew.
We actually finally have a plan.

1670
03:06:33,099 --> 03:06:34,809
We have a plan.

1671
03:06:50,158 --> 03:06:52,202
The symbol of the house of El
means hope.

1672
03:06:52,369 --> 03:06:54,537
Embodied within that hope
is the fundamental belief

1673
03:06:54,704 --> 03:06:58,416
in the potential of every person
to be a force for good.

1674
03:06:58,583 --> 03:06:59,584
Clark...

1675
03:06:59,667 --> 03:07:00,877
That's what you can bring them.

1676
03:07:01,044 --> 03:07:03,004
...you were sent here
for a reason.

1677
03:07:03,171 --> 03:07:05,090
You will give
the people of Earth

1678
03:07:05,173 --> 03:07:07,050
an ideal to strive towards.

1679
03:07:07,717 --> 03:07:09,552
And even If it takes you
the rest of your life,

1680
03:07:09,719 --> 03:07:13,473
you owe it to yourself
to find out what that reason is.

1681
03:07:13,640 --> 03:07:16,267
They will stumble,
they will fall.

1682
03:07:16,434 --> 03:07:17,769
You're gonna
have to make a choice.

1683
03:07:18,561 --> 03:07:20,980
They will join you
in the sun, Kal.

1684
03:07:21,147 --> 03:07:23,066
A choice
of whether to stand proud

1685
03:07:23,149 --> 03:07:25,110
in front of the human race or not.

1686
03:07:25,276 --> 03:07:28,446
You will help them
accomplish wonders.

1687
03:07:45,588 --> 03:07:50,093
All the hopes and dreams
of Krypton live in you now.

1688
03:07:50,260 --> 03:07:52,512
I'm so proud of you, son.

1689
03:07:53,847 --> 03:07:55,890
Your mother and I loved you.

1690
03:07:56,558 --> 03:07:58,017
Your mother and I knew

1691
03:07:58,101 --> 03:08:00,103
you would change the world.

1692
03:08:01,396 --> 03:08:03,231
Your heart was tested.

1693
03:08:04,524 --> 03:08:06,484
I know it's been hard, Clark.

1694
03:08:07,235 --> 03:08:10,155
But you gave hope
to their world.

1695
03:08:10,321 --> 03:08:12,991
You need
to show them who you are.

1696
03:08:13,700 --> 03:08:15,410
Love them, Kal.

1697
03:08:16,035 --> 03:08:18,163
The way we loved you.

1698
03:08:20,623 --> 03:08:21,749
Fly, son.

1699
03:08:22,792 --> 03:08:24,002
It's time.

1700
03:09:27,774 --> 03:09:29,234
I'm gonna take out that tower

1701
03:09:29,317 --> 03:09:30,902
and knock down that shield dome.

1702
03:09:31,069 --> 03:09:32,195
Whatever you see,

1703
03:09:33,530 --> 03:09:34,656
stick to the plan.

1704
03:09:37,367 --> 03:09:39,285
It's why I brought you together.

1705
03:10:19,367 --> 03:10:21,119
Bruce, pull back.
You're not gonna make it.

1706
03:10:24,247 --> 03:10:26,958
Just have to knock
a little louder.

1707
03:10:51,941 --> 03:10:52,942
Kill him!

1708
03:10:53,693 --> 03:10:56,446
Get to the carriage. Defend The Unity.

1709
03:11:01,659 --> 03:11:02,493
Oh, shit.

1710
03:11:22,805 --> 03:11:23,890
The tower's down.

1711
03:11:26,225 --> 03:11:26,934
Do you read me?

1712
03:11:27,560 --> 03:11:28,686
Uh, yeah, loud and clear.

1713
03:11:29,771 --> 03:11:31,147
Are you okay?

1714
03:11:32,398 --> 03:11:34,984
Bruce? Bruce?

1715
03:11:35,276 --> 03:11:36,402
Get to the reactor.

1716
03:11:36,486 --> 03:11:37,612
I'll lure as many of these monsters

1717
03:11:37,695 --> 03:11:39,822
-away from you as I can.
-What does that mean?

1718
03:11:42,825 --> 03:11:44,827
Don't worry about me.
Get to The Unity.

1719
03:11:47,497 --> 03:11:48,623
They're here.

1720
03:11:48,706 --> 03:11:49,791
Bruce?

1721
03:11:52,877 --> 03:11:54,170
Comm went dead.

1722
03:11:55,880 --> 03:11:57,131
Let's go.

1723
03:12:36,045 --> 03:12:37,880
Come on, follow me, you damn insects.

1724
03:13:57,835 --> 03:13:59,003
Critical damage.

1725
03:14:39,001 --> 03:14:40,253
You really are outta your mind.

1726
03:15:07,154 --> 03:15:08,281
You're welcome.

1727
03:15:08,447 --> 03:15:09,740
My man.

1728
03:16:42,833 --> 03:16:44,460
Yeah, we got this.

1729
03:16:44,627 --> 03:16:46,003
You go do your thing.

1730
03:17:41,809 --> 03:17:43,310
I'm assuming you're Alfred.

1731
03:17:45,187 --> 03:17:46,480
Master Kent.

1732
03:17:48,524 --> 03:17:50,026
He said you'd come.

1733
03:17:51,736 --> 03:17:55,156
Now, let's hope you're not too late.

1734
03:18:06,000 --> 03:18:08,294
-Hey!

1735
03:18:16,385 --> 03:18:17,720
Remember me?

1736
03:18:20,264 --> 03:18:21,682
Round two?

1737
03:18:22,391 --> 03:18:23,559
Hell yeah.

1738
03:18:45,081 --> 03:18:46,457
Shall we?

1739
03:18:47,416 --> 03:18:49,710
Tell me, Amazon,

1740
03:18:49,877 --> 03:18:53,172
why did you abandon your own sisters

1741
03:18:54,090 --> 03:18:56,550
only to cast your lot
with these creatures

1742
03:18:56,717 --> 03:18:59,970
clinging to their puny lives?

1743
03:19:00,179 --> 03:19:03,015
You weren't there
to protect them from me.

1744
03:19:03,265 --> 03:19:05,309
And, sadly, you could have.

1745
03:19:46,267 --> 03:19:47,977
Barry, I'm in position.

1746
03:20:06,745 --> 03:20:09,456
Okay. I built the charge.

1747
03:20:10,082 --> 03:20:11,167
You call it.

1748
03:20:12,334 --> 03:20:13,586
Barry, on one.

1749
03:20:14,253 --> 03:20:16,213
Three, two...

1750
03:20:19,383 --> 03:20:20,759
Get the hell off me!

1751
03:20:21,260 --> 03:20:22,595
Victor!

1752
03:20:58,672 --> 03:21:00,216
Victor!

1753
03:21:04,053 --> 03:21:06,555
| watched your island burn,

1754
03:21:06,722 --> 03:21:10,184
your sisters begging for their lives.

1755
03:21:10,351 --> 03:21:12,603
As did your mother.

1756
03:21:12,978 --> 03:21:13,979
Liar.

1757
03:21:39,713 --> 03:21:41,715
| can't maintain this!

1758
03:21:42,591 --> 03:21:43,592
Victor!

1759
03:22:05,823 --> 03:22:08,033
Victor, I can't hold this!

1760
03:22:14,707 --> 03:22:16,959
For Darkseid.

1761
03:22:20,921 --> 03:22:23,299
Not impressed.

1762
03:23:07,801 --> 03:23:08,927
All right.

1763
03:23:09,094 --> 03:23:10,679
Kal-El.

1764
03:23:49,218 --> 03:23:51,428
Barry, I'm connected to The Unity.

1765
03:23:51,595 --> 03:23:53,555
| need the charge to get inside.

1766
03:24:15,619 --> 03:24:16,620
Barry?

1767
03:24:17,538 --> 03:24:19,206
Barry, are you okay?

1768
03:24:20,833 --> 03:24:21,834
Barry!

1769
03:24:21,917 --> 03:24:23,335
| got the wind knocked out of me.

1770
03:24:23,419 --> 03:24:25,421
Need a few seconds, that's all!

1771
03:24:42,521 --> 03:24:45,357
Barry, where are you?
It's almost synchronized!

1772
03:24:45,607 --> 03:24:47,359
Okay, okay.

1773
03:24:47,734 --> 03:24:50,362
Oh, my God.
Gotta heal, Barry.

1774
03:24:50,529 --> 03:24:52,197
Heal. Heal.

1775
03:25:18,056 --> 03:25:19,600
Barry!

1776
03:25:32,529 --> 03:25:34,239
It's too late.

1777
03:25:35,574 --> 03:25:36,992
Oh, no.

1778
03:25:41,205 --> 03:25:42,873
He's here!

1779
03:26:12,361 --> 03:26:13,403
Okay.

1780
03:26:13,487 --> 03:26:14,863
Just gotta go faster
than the speed of light.

1781
03:26:14,947 --> 03:26:15,948
Far beyond the speed of light.

1782
03:26:16,114 --> 03:26:17,241
You gotta break the rule, Barry,

1783
03:26:17,324 --> 03:26:19,368
and you gotta do it now.

1784
03:26:32,422 --> 03:26:34,132
Dad...

1785
03:26:37,970 --> 03:26:40,305
whatever happens, I want you to know

1786
03:26:43,016 --> 03:26:45,018
your kid was one of them, Dad.

1787
03:26:48,230 --> 03:26:50,148
One of the best of the best.

1788
03:27:45,579 --> 03:27:48,123
Make your own future.

1789
03:27:54,588 --> 03:27:56,548
Make your own past.

1790
03:28:01,136 --> 03:28:04,681
It's all right now.

1791
03:28:51,728 --> 03:28:53,897
We've been waiting for you, Victor.

1792
03:28:55,023 --> 03:28:57,109
My broken boy.

1793
03:28:59,528 --> 03:29:01,530
You don't have to be alone anymore.

1794
03:29:01,697 --> 03:29:03,365
We'll be together again.

1795
03:29:11,206 --> 03:29:13,291
We can put it back, Vic.

1796
03:29:17,629 --> 03:29:19,756
Make you whole again.

1797
03:29:31,601 --> 03:29:33,353
I'm not broken.

1798
03:29:43,071 --> 03:29:44,948
And I'm not alone.

1799
03:30:01,757 --> 03:30:02,758
Superman!

1800
03:31:33,431 --> 03:31:35,392
| told you

1801
03:31:36,977 --> 03:31:39,604
Steppenwolf would fail.

1802
03:31:40,564 --> 03:31:44,234
Yes. Yes, you did.

1803
03:31:44,901 --> 03:31:46,278
My master,

1804
03:31:46,361 --> 03:31:49,406
now that the Mother Boxes
have been destroyed,

1805
03:31:50,282 --> 03:31:54,035
how will you retrieve your great prize?

1806
03:31:54,286 --> 03:31:57,706
Anti-Life is found, DeSaad.

1807
03:31:57,873 --> 03:32:02,544
And we will stop at nothing
to possess it.

1808
03:32:05,714 --> 03:32:07,215
Ready the armada.

1809
03:32:08,133 --> 03:32:10,552
We will use the old ways.

1810
03:34:34,904 --> 03:34:37,032
Your father twice over.

1811
03:34:44,330 --> 03:34:46,791
Now, let me speak to you
from my heart,

1812
03:34:46,875 --> 03:34:48,668
not as a scientist,

1813
03:34:48,835 --> 03:34:50,503
as a father.

1814
03:34:50,628 --> 03:34:53,757
Your father twice over.

1815
03:34:56,301 --> 03:34:59,721
| brought you into the world
and back to it.

1816
03:34:59,888 --> 03:35:03,516
You can't imagine how proud I am
of who you are.

1817
03:35:04,059 --> 03:35:05,727
Have always been.

1818
03:35:07,854 --> 03:35:09,230
So many years with you I wasted.

1819
03:35:09,314 --> 03:35:12,734
So many wrongs I've left un-righted.

1820
03:35:15,195 --> 03:35:17,072
Everything breaks, Victor.

1821
03:35:17,655 --> 03:35:19,908
Everything changes.

1822
03:35:30,585 --> 03:35:32,670
| gotta go see my father.

1823
03:36:08,248 --> 03:36:10,083
The world is hurt.

1824
03:36:10,250 --> 03:36:11,334
Broken.

1825
03:36:11,501 --> 03:36:13,294
Unexchangeable.

1826
03:36:14,087 --> 03:36:15,755
Ship's all yours now, Kid.

1827
03:36:15,839 --> 03:36:17,173
You're the boss.

1828
03:36:19,467 --> 03:36:22,637
"Ryan Choi, Director of Nanotechnology."

1829
03:36:22,804 --> 03:36:24,305
That's your thing.

1830
03:36:24,973 --> 03:36:26,391
Uh, yep.

1831
03:36:26,975 --> 03:36:28,560
That's my thing.

1832
03:36:33,606 --> 03:36:37,694
But the world's
not fixed in the past,

1833
03:36:37,777 --> 03:36:38,945
only the future.

1834
03:36:40,822 --> 03:36:44,701
The not yet. The now.

1835
03:36:44,868 --> 03:36:47,829
Wow. Must be 100, 150 feet.

1836
03:36:48,413 --> 03:36:49,747
Must be.

1837
03:36:50,874 --> 03:36:52,500
Big round table.

1838
03:36:52,667 --> 03:36:54,836
Six chairs, right there.

1839
03:36:55,962 --> 03:36:57,589
But room for more.

1840
03:37:00,008 --> 03:37:01,634
But room for more.

1841
03:37:02,635 --> 03:37:04,387
God help us.

1842
03:37:06,181 --> 03:37:08,183
The now is you.

1843
03:37:11,895 --> 03:37:13,271
What?

1844
03:37:13,438 --> 03:37:16,232
It's actually the worst job
you can get in a crime lab.

1845
03:37:16,399 --> 03:37:18,776
But, uh, my foot's in the door.

1846
03:37:18,943 --> 03:37:20,528
This is like a "job" job?

1847
03:37:21,321 --> 03:37:22,447
"Job" job.

1848
03:37:26,117 --> 03:37:28,703
Your foot's in the door.

1849
03:37:31,039 --> 03:37:32,165
Isn't that a thing people say?

1850
03:37:32,332 --> 03:37:34,250
Your foot's in the door.

1851
03:37:34,417 --> 03:37:36,711
Yeah, that's something people say, man.

1852
03:37:36,878 --> 03:37:38,296
-His foot's in the door!

1853
03:37:38,588 --> 03:37:41,049
-That's my boy, right there!
-Oh, gosh. Oh, gosh.

1854
03:37:41,257 --> 03:37:42,592
Taught him nothing he knows.

1855
03:37:42,759 --> 03:37:44,844
- Yes!
-Dad, you're gonna get maced again.

1856
03:37:48,306 --> 03:37:50,016
No stopping you now.

1857
03:37:52,143 --> 03:37:53,394
Thanks, Dad.

1858
03:37:53,561 --> 03:37:54,604
Now.

1859
03:37:54,771 --> 03:37:57,857
Now's your time, Victor, to rise.

1860
03:37:58,149 --> 03:38:01,110
"Thank you" is not enough
for what you did.

1861
03:38:01,277 --> 03:38:04,656
| just undid a mistake, that's all.

1862
03:38:15,083 --> 03:38:17,543
How did you get the house
back from the bank?

1863
03:38:18,002 --> 03:38:20,004
| bought the bank.

1864
03:38:22,423 --> 03:38:24,717
Congratulations, by the way.

1865
03:38:25,051 --> 03:38:26,594
Do this. Be this.

1866
03:38:26,970 --> 03:38:31,140
The man I never was. The hero you are.

1867
03:38:32,308 --> 03:38:34,602
Take your place among the brave ones.

1868
03:38:34,769 --> 03:38:39,691
The ones that were, that are,
that are yet to be.

1869
03:39:12,348 --> 03:39:15,268
It's time you stand,

1870
03:39:19,022 --> 03:39:20,523
fight

1871
03:39:23,151 --> 03:39:24,569
discover,

1872
03:39:29,324 --> 03:39:31,409
heal love,

1873
03:39:34,996 --> 03:39:36,039
win.

1874
03:40:02,648 --> 03:40:04,233
The time

1875
03:40:04,525 --> 03:40:05,902
IS Now.

1876
03:40:15,078 --> 03:40:16,329
Ready?

1877
03:40:16,496 --> 03:40:17,789
Come on, Stevens.

1878
03:40:21,417 --> 03:40:22,710
All right,
let's keep it moving.

1879
03:40:24,629 --> 03:40:25,755
Keep going.

1880
03:40:27,548 --> 03:40:29,300
Come on, Luthor.
Let's go.

1881
03:40:32,970 --> 03:40:34,097
Luthor.

1882
03:40:39,102 --> 03:40:40,103
Open up two, Carl, please.

1883
03:40:49,278 --> 03:40:50,571
Luthor.

1884
03:40:55,618 --> 03:40:57,245
All right, stop jerking around, Luthor,

1885
03:40:57,328 --> 03:40:58,830
or I'm gonna have to come in there.

1886
03:42:27,460 --> 03:42:29,378
Ah, there he is.

1887
03:42:30,129 --> 03:42:31,380
Welcome aboard.

1888
03:42:31,547 --> 03:42:33,341
Care for a glass of Gout de Diamants?

1889
03:42:33,508 --> 03:42:35,384
| was just celebrating God's return.

1890
03:42:35,551 --> 03:42:37,845
Out of the ground
and back up into the sky.

1891
03:42:38,221 --> 03:42:39,222
I heard you were

1892
03:42:39,305 --> 03:42:40,473
a few clowns short of a circus.

1893
03:42:40,681 --> 03:42:42,350
I was, thank you,

1894
03:42:42,517 --> 03:42:44,644
until the good doctors
at Arkham helped me

1895
03:42:44,727 --> 03:42:46,812
find some much needed clarity.

1896
03:42:46,979 --> 03:42:49,190
Now, you volunteered
to destroy the bat

1897
03:42:49,273 --> 03:42:50,274
free of charge.

1898
03:42:50,441 --> 03:42:51,943
Why the pro bono work?

1899
03:42:52,318 --> 03:42:53,778
It's personal.

1900
03:42:54,445 --> 03:42:57,240
Ah, let me guess, an eye for an eye?

1901
03:42:59,325 --> 03:43:01,035
You said you had something I'd want?

1902
03:43:01,202 --> 03:43:02,620
You'd better not be wasting my time.

1903
03:43:03,037 --> 03:43:04,872
Ooh. And endure your wrath, Mr. Wilson?

1904
03:43:04,956 --> 03:43:06,707
No, I wouldn't think of it.

1905
03:43:06,874 --> 03:43:08,209
Uh, I have too much to live for.

1906
03:43:08,292 --> 03:43:10,461
And more important things to do.

1907
03:43:11,420 --> 03:43:14,882
But if you want the Batman,

1908
03:43:15,049 --> 03:43:18,135
here is something that can help you.

1909
03:43:19,470 --> 03:43:23,599
His name is Bruce Wayne.

1910
03:43:26,811 --> 03:43:29,230
Hmm. On second thought,

1911
03:43:31,566 --> 03:43:33,484
we do have something to celebrate.

1912
03:43:34,610 --> 03:43:36,028
Good boy.

1913
03:44:40,343 --> 03:44:41,552
Clear.

1914
03:44:47,058 --> 03:44:48,559
How much further?

1915
03:44:49,810 --> 03:44:51,020
We're almost there.

1916
03:44:53,272 --> 03:44:54,815
Well, we need to hurry.

1917
03:44:54,982 --> 03:44:56,484
We can't be out in the open much longer.

1918
03:44:56,651 --> 03:44:58,277
He'll come for us.

1919
03:45:01,238 --> 03:45:02,865
Let him come.

1920
03:45:03,366 --> 03:45:04,992
Let the bastard come.

1921
03:45:06,452 --> 03:45:08,537
I'll stab this through his heart

1922
03:45:08,621 --> 03:45:10,247
for what he did to Arthur.

1923
03:45:11,040 --> 03:45:12,958
| want to make him pay.

1924
03:45:14,669 --> 03:45:16,962
| understand how you feel, Mera.

1925
03:45:17,463 --> 03:45:19,965
You have no idea how I feel.

1926
03:45:20,466 --> 03:45:22,343
But we have to stick to the plan

1927
03:45:22,426 --> 03:45:24,595
to have any chance to make this right.

1928
03:45:32,520 --> 03:45:35,940
Who have you ever loved?

1929
03:45:50,079 --> 03:45:53,249
Au contraire,
my little fish stick.

1930
03:45:57,002 --> 03:45:58,629
He knows exactly what it's like

1931
03:45:58,713 --> 03:46:00,423
to lose someone he loves.

1932
03:46:02,383 --> 03:46:04,635
You know, like, uh,

1933
03:46:05,970 --> 03:46:07,346
a father,

1934
03:46:08,806 --> 03:46:10,141
like a mother.

1935
03:46:11,142 --> 03:46:14,186
Be very careful
with the next thing you say.

1936
03:46:15,855 --> 03:46:17,857
Like an adopted son.

1937
03:46:21,610 --> 03:46:23,237
Isn't that right,

1938
03:46:24,780 --> 03:46:26,240
Batman?

1939
03:46:29,493 --> 03:46:30,911
Maybe, in a way,

1940
03:46:30,995 --> 03:46:32,705
that smelly old flounder is right.

1941
03:46:34,540 --> 03:46:37,293
Because how many can die in your arms

1942
03:46:37,376 --> 03:46:38,836
before you grow numb to death?

1943
03:46:40,421 --> 03:46:42,298
That's not very careful.

1944
03:46:43,549 --> 03:46:46,677
And how many dead eyes
can you look into

1945
03:46:47,386 --> 03:46:49,764
before you die inside yourself?

1946
03:46:50,306 --> 03:46:53,976
I've been dead inside a long time,

1947
03:46:54,143 --> 03:46:56,061
but even I have a limit.

1948
03:46:56,228 --> 03:46:57,938
And if you cross that line,
| swear to God, I will...

1949
03:46:58,105 --> 03:47:00,399
Before what, Bruce? Kill me?

1950
03:47:01,108 --> 03:47:02,902
You won't kill me.

1951
03:47:03,778 --> 03:47:05,738
I'm your best friend.

1952
03:47:06,238 --> 03:47:10,284
Besides, who's gonna give you
a reach-around?

1953
03:47:12,286 --> 03:47:13,662
Anyway,

1954
03:47:14,955 --> 03:47:16,499
you need me.

1955
03:47:17,541 --> 03:47:19,043
You

1956
03:47:19,585 --> 03:47:22,463
need me to help you undo this world

1957
03:47:22,546 --> 03:47:25,216
you created by letting her die.

1958
03:47:27,802 --> 03:47:29,053
Poor Lois.

1959
03:47:29,845 --> 03:47:32,640
How she suffered so!

1960
03:47:38,521 --> 03:47:39,980
| often wonder

1961
03:47:40,940 --> 03:47:42,817
how many alternate timelines

1962
03:47:42,900 --> 03:47:45,069
do you destroy the world because...

1963
03:47:46,237 --> 03:47:50,407
frankly, you don't have
the cojones to die yourself.

1964
03:47:51,408 --> 03:47:52,827
Hmm?

1965
03:47:54,995 --> 03:47:58,791
So, as usual, I'll be the bigger man.

1966
03:48:02,628 --> 03:48:04,088
A truce,

1967
03:48:04,922 --> 03:48:06,215
Bruce.

1968
03:48:08,968 --> 03:48:13,055
As long as you have this card, a truce.

1969
03:48:16,100 --> 03:48:18,102
But all you have to do
is tear it in half

1970
03:48:18,185 --> 03:48:19,311
and I'm happy to discuss with you

1971
03:48:19,478 --> 03:48:22,481
in any way you like,
why you sent a Boy Wonder...

1972
03:48:24,233 --> 03:48:26,068
to do a man's job.

1973
03:48:29,488 --> 03:48:31,282
You know, it's funny

1974
03:48:31,448 --> 03:48:32,825
that you would talk about people

1975
03:48:32,908 --> 03:48:34,493
who died in my arms

1976
03:48:34,660 --> 03:48:36,370
because when I held Harley Quinn

1977
03:48:36,537 --> 03:48:38,998
and she was bleeding and dying,

1978
03:48:39,164 --> 03:48:42,710
she begged me with her last breath

1979
03:48:42,877 --> 03:48:45,129
that when I killed you,

1980
03:48:45,296 --> 03:48:48,716
and make no mistake,
| will fucking kill you...

1981
03:48:48,883 --> 03:48:50,718
that I'd do it slow.

1982
03:48:51,927 --> 03:48:53,888
I'm gonna honor that promise.

1983
03:49:24,501 --> 03:49:27,254
Oh. You're good.

1984
03:49:31,550 --> 03:49:33,135
You almost had me.

1985
03:49:52,613 --> 03:49:53,697
Where are we holing up?

1986
03:49:53,864 --> 03:49:56,116
Somewhere he'll never suspect.

1987
03:49:56,575 --> 03:49:59,495
Still think it was a good idea
bringing him along?

1988
03:49:59,578 --> 03:50:02,122
-What do you think?

1989
03:50:08,212 --> 03:50:09,213
He's found us.

1990
03:51:38,385 --> 03:51:39,845
Can I help you?

1991
03:51:41,221 --> 03:51:44,725
I'm sure you know Darkseid
is not finished with Earth.

1992
03:51:44,892 --> 03:51:47,895
The Anti-Life Equation
is here somewhere.

1993
03:51:48,062 --> 03:51:50,856
We have to find it before he does.

1994
03:51:51,023 --> 03:51:52,733
There's a war coming.

1995
03:51:53,025 --> 03:51:54,777
And I'm here to help.

1996
03:51:54,943 --> 03:51:57,196
I'm sorry, who are you again?

1997
03:51:57,362 --> 03:51:59,573
I've gone by many names

1998
03:51:59,656 --> 03:52:02,451
and taken many forms. And like you,

1999
03:52:03,077 --> 03:52:05,704
I've realized
| have a stake in this world

2000
03:52:05,871 --> 03:52:08,332
and it's time I started fighting for it.

2001
03:52:09,083 --> 03:52:10,209
Oh.

2002
03:52:11,877 --> 03:52:14,004
Well, we could definitely use the help.

2003
03:52:14,213 --> 03:52:17,424
So, glad you're here.

2004
03:52:18,675 --> 03:52:19,676
You know, I never thought

2005
03:52:19,760 --> 03:52:20,844
I'd see the defenders of Earth

2006
03:52:21,011 --> 03:52:23,180
united and fighting as one.

2007
03:52:24,181 --> 03:52:26,558
It wouldn't have happened
without you, Bruce.

2008
03:52:28,018 --> 03:52:30,395
Your mother and father would be proud.

2009
03:52:31,772 --> 03:52:32,940
| hope so.

2010
03:52:38,987 --> 03:52:41,949
Well, I'll be in touch.

2011
03:52:42,991 --> 03:52:47,037
Oh, and some have called me

2012
03:52:47,204 --> 03:52:49,498
the Martian Manhunter.

2013
03:52:57,214 --> 03:52:59,550
| guess I'll see you around.

2014
03:56:42,147 --> 03:56:45,901
I've heard there was a secret chord

2015
03:56:47,110 --> 03:56:51,073
That David played
And it pleased the Lord

2016
03:56:51,907 --> 03:56:57,371
But you don't really care
For music, do ya?

2017
03:56:59,915 --> 03:57:03,543
It goes like this
The fourth, the fifth

2018
03:57:03,627 --> 03:57:07,547
The minor fall, the major lift

2019
03:57:07,631 --> 03:57:13,804
The baffled king composing "Hallelujah”

2020
03:57:15,639 --> 03:57:19,101
Hallelujah

2021
03:57:19,184 --> 03:57:21,770
Hallelujah

2022
03:57:23,021 --> 03:57:26,858
Hallelujah

2023
03:57:26,942 --> 03:57:32,239
Hallelujah

2024
03:57:35,158 --> 03:57:39,204
Your faith was strong
But you needed proof

2025
03:57:39,788 --> 03:57:43,208
You saw her bathing on the roof

2026
03:57:43,291 --> 03:57:47,838
Her beauty and the moonlight
Overthrew ya

2027
03:57:50,799 --> 03:57:54,177
She tied you to a kitchen chair

2028
03:57:54,344 --> 03:57:58,306
She broke your throne
And she cut your hair

2029
03:57:58,390 --> 03:58:04,938
And from your lips
She drew the Hallelujah

2030
03:58:05,188 --> 03:58:08,900
Hallelujah

2031
03:58:09,109 --> 03:58:11,945
Hallelujah

2032
03:58:12,946 --> 03:58:16,491
Hallelujah

2033
03:58:16,575 --> 03:58:21,997
Hallelujah

2034
03:58:25,041 --> 03:58:29,004
Well, baby, I've been here before

2035
03:58:29,421 --> 03:58:33,675
I've seen this room
And I've walked this floor

2036
03:58:33,758 --> 03:58:38,388
| used to live alone before I knew you

2037
03:58:41,433 --> 03:58:45,312
And I've seen your flag
On the marble arch

2038
03:58:45,395 --> 03:58:49,107
And love is not a victory march

2039
03:58:49,357 --> 03:58:56,072
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

2040
03:58:56,656 --> 03:59:00,410
Hallelujah

2041
03:59:00,619 --> 03:59:03,205
Hallelujah

2042
03:59:04,498 --> 03:59:08,502
Hallelujah

2043
03:59:08,585 --> 03:59:13,632
Hallelujah

2044
03:59:17,886 --> 03:59:21,473
Well, there was a time
When you would let me know

2045
03:59:22,599 --> 03:59:26,686
What's really going on below

2046
03:59:27,103 --> 03:59:32,192
But now you never
Show that to me, do you?

2047
03:59:35,278 --> 03:59:38,823
And remember when I moved in you

2048
03:59:38,907 --> 03:59:42,661
The holy dove was moving, too

2049
03:59:42,786 --> 03:59:49,334
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

2050
03:59:50,669 --> 03:59:54,172
Hallelujah

2051
03:59:54,256 --> 03:59:56,967
Hallelujah

2052
03:59:58,343 --> 04:00:01,763
Hallelujah

2053
04:00:01,846 --> 04:00:08,728
Hallelujah

2054
04:00:23,994 --> 04:00:28,665
Well, maybe there's a God above

2055
04:00:31,293 --> 04:00:36,047
But all I've ever learned from love

2056
04:00:37,924 --> 04:00:40,552
Was how to shoot at somebody

2057
04:00:41,928 --> 04:00:45,724
Who outdrew you

2058
04:00:47,726 --> 04:00:51,688
And it's not a cry
That you hear at night

2059
04:00:51,896 --> 04:00:55,942
It's not somebody who's seen the light

2060
04:00:56,109 --> 04:00:57,902
It's a cold

2061
04:00:57,986 --> 04:01:04,784
And it's a broken Hallelujah

2062
04:01:05,243 --> 04:01:08,872
Hallelujah

2063
04:01:08,955 --> 04:01:11,916
Hallelujah

2064
04:01:12,125 --> 04:01:15,629
Hallelujah

2065
04:01:15,712 --> 04:01:21,343
Hallelujah

2066
04:01:22,552 --> 04:01:25,138
Hallelujah

2067
04:01:25,221 --> 04:01:28,850
Hallelujah

2068
04:01:30,602 --> 04:01:32,646
Hallelujah

2069
04:01:34,230 --> 04:01:40,487
Hallelujah
