1
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:48,208
This is a chimp.

2
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:49,708
He'll travel to Mars.

3
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:50,625
Mars.

4
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:52,791
We...are humans.

5
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,416
And we aren't going anywhere.

6
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:57,416
We'll stay right here
and suck on each other's blood.

7
00:01:57,791 --> 00:01:59,208
By the way, for your information,
I must tell you...

8
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:00,583
...that I was born
with this condition.

9
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:02,958
Not the one I'm having now.
I meant the Cerebral Palsy.

10
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:05,541
As a result,
I can speak fluently only in my mind.

11
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:07,291
Whereas in reality...

12
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:09,833
Don't force to me...

13
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:11,958
Aafia, give it to me.

14
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:12,791
I sound like this.

15
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,208
Was that funny?

16
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:15,583
Did you have a laugh?

17
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,041
Now can I get on with the story?

18
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:19,833
This gun is not for
blowing my own brains out.

19
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:21,458
It's for someone else.

20
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:24,458
But if they try to stop me,
I swear I will kill myself.

21
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:26,041
Which reminds me...

22
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:28,416
This stressed woman
that you see is my mother.

23
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:29,875
And that's my father.

24
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:32,416
Afghani on my mother's son,
and Punjabi from my father's side.

25
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,333
They all love me.

26
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:37,000
Although I didn't make
many mistakes in life...

27
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:39,958
...but no matter what I did,
they all stood by me.

28
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:43,041
Even though I had a condition,
they never let me lose courage.

29
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:45,083
They educated me and made me capable.

30
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:47,291
So capable that I am now the...

31
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:50,541
...senior mathematician in America's
most premiere space organization.

32
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:53,708
I made a zero-gravity
simulator on Earth.

33
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:57,666
And now I am planning the
world's first manned mission to Mars.

34
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,500
I'll be giving a seminar
before thousands of people today...

35
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,791
...for sending this chimp on Mars.

36
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:06,458
To raise money and to convince
the American Government to support us.

37
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:09,041
But there's going to be
another guest at this seminar.

38
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:13,750
I am far more eager to
see him then he is to come here.

39
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:16,083
Let him show up first.

40
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:19,916
By the way, this story
doesn't begin from where I did.

41
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:23,125
But it was important for
me to let you hear my voice.

42
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:27,041
To warn you that with your
habit of laughing things away...

43
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:30,625
...you don't forget that
this story is as much as about me...

44
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:32,291
...as much as about that funny man.

45
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,708
I just want you to
take care of yourself.

46
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:38,000
Don't get lost in this crowd.

47
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:40,208
Or get out pocket picket.

48
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:43,291
Or let someone's cuteness fool you.

49
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:45,458
Like I <i>was.</i>

50
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,791
So, sorry for the interruption.

51
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:51,541
Now you can hear the story
from where it actually begins.

52
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:08,916
Please let me go.

53
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:11,791
Catch her.

54
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,041
Stop!

55
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:27,458
Where to, princess?

56
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:30,833
- Let me go.
- Scream if you want.

57
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:33,166
- Scream!
- Leave me.

58
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:38,333
Let the toughest man in all Meerut
save you from my clutches.

59
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,583
- Anyone there?
- Ashok!

60
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,625
May the good Lord forgive us!

61
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,875
[french language]

62
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,875
[french language]

63
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,500
Can't you speak French?

64
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:40,791
Ashok, didn't I hit you yesterday?

65
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:42,000
So what?

66
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:44,083
So what!

67
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:50,291
Times have changed, boy.

68
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:53,541
Your father must be "the boy."
They call me Bauua Singh.

69
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:56,750
Bauua!

70
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,875
Oh no! That same dream.

71
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:04,708
Did you save my honour again
in your dream?

72
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,333
- Yes.
- Bauua.

73
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:10,291
Your friends are here.

74
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:12,375
Your father is calling you
for breakfast.

75
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:15,166
Bring me tea. Wash your hands first.

76
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:18,041
- Bauua.
- Who's that?

77
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:21,833
Bauua. Bauua.

78
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:24,500
Bauua come out.

79
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:26,666
Your Majesty! Good morning.

80
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:28,791
Good morning, guys. What's up?

81
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:30,958
Look! The new iPhone.

82
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:31,916
Wow!

83
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,541
Sire, this jewel in rags...

84
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:36,750
...has brought great news for you.

85
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:40,083
Your heart will melt.
You'll singing devotional songs.

86
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:44,250
- The most delightful news ever.
- Read it out!

87
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:45,416
Yes.

88
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:50,291
"Babita Kumari's heart
has been broken again.

89
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:53,041
- Wow!
- "At director Imtiaz Ali's party...

90
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:57,166
"...the spat between Babita Kumari
and her boyfriend intensified.

91
00:06:57,166 --> 00:07:00,583
<i>WmmfihMmKastwap's
mum...</i>

92
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:04,625
"...but Babita has refused
to work with her guy.

93
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:11,166
“At a party, her close friend
Shamina Khan let slip the reason why:

94
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:14,000
"He's with another actress.

95
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,083
"Has it happened again?

96
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:19,583
“Has Babita Kumari's heart been
broken by another flirt?"

97
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,125
Your bride has missed the wedding bus.

98
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:23,583
Bless you.

99
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:25,333
Guddu, that's terrific news.

100
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:31,875
Today is Eid. Give these guys
a SOC-rupee bundle.

101
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:33,958
It'll make their day.

102
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:34,625
Wait!

103
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:36,458
Behave you guys.

104
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:38,000
- Is he up yet?
- No.

105
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,750
He'll only get up when my dead body
leaves this house.

106
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:47,500
Have your breakfast. Stop nagging him.
He's just a kid.

107
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,750
Only in height. He eats
like a full-grown man.

108
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,916
You're just...

109
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:55,625
I slave away while mister wants
fresh orange juice.

110
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:57,500
I am not his father...

111
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,833
...but a money printing
machine to him.

112
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:05,125
Keep them coming.

113
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:06,500
Keep them coming.

114
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:12,166
Hey, orphans! Enjoy biryani
in my bride Babita's name.

115
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:13,500
Hey, you!

116
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:15,666
Stop!

117
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:18,250
The whole neighbourhood's shown up.

118
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,333
You incompetent idiots!

119
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,416
Snatch the cash from him.

120
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:27,083
- Have your breakfast.
- I won't spare him today.

121
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:29,000
You...

122
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,666
Squandering my money.

123
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:34,000
- He's a kid.
- A kid, my foot!

124
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,875
You're an angel of death.

125
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:38,250
Don't talk nonsense, Ashok.

126
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,666
Your bad habits made me short.

127
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:42,833
So what if I spend your money?

128
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,541
My bad habits?

129
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,541
Is my height my fault?

130
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,500
- All that tobacco-chewing
stunted your genes. - Shut up!

131
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,125
- My genes?
- It's stunted. I've read about it.

132
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:55,833
Either I kill him or you kill me.

133
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:59,833
Try saying that when a cop's
twisting his stick inside you.

134
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:02,791
- Go on. Hit me.
- Go downstairs for my sake.

135
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:04,791


136
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:07,875
- I'm taking your car.
- Be my guest!

137
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,916
Even your belt's too soft.

138
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:15,541
Bauua, why are you after him?

139
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:17,666
Look at my height. He owes me, Amma.

140
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:19,958
Son, it's God's will
that you're a dwarf.

141
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:23,333
Your God has had His way.
Now it's my turn.

142
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:27,458
OK. Give me my suit
and the "Dhoom 3" bowler hat.

143
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,708
I'm seeing my bride's new movie.

144
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:35,083
Amma, I've told you so many times...

145
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:36,916
...don't you cry.

146
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:43,541
- Found your perfect wife?
- Pandey is looking for girl.

147
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,583
- Nigaar cinema.
- How many passengers?

148
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,833
Just me, the small kid.
And my father.

149
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,791
Why are you joking, sir?
You're a grown man.

150
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:57,458
So why ask? Shall I...?

151
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,166
- I charge 20 rupees.
- It's 10 for Nigaar cinema.

152
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:03,916
Pay me <i>5</i> and pull
the rickshaw yourself.

153
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:06,666
10 rupees per passenger.
No matter how many.

154
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:08,916
- Can you pull us all?
- Yes.

155
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,291
Gimme five!

156
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,125
We're off to see
my bride's movie. Come!

157
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:21,166
Come! We're off to see
my bride's movie.

158
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:24,291
Come one. Come all.
Come on.

159
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,333
Come and enjoy Babita's latest!

160
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:29,916
Two sexy item numbers.

161
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:32,041
He can pull us all.

162
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:33,166
Come on.

163
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,666
Guddu, should I call Junaid?

164
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:39,541
Forget it! He prefers the star Deepika
and Hollywood movies.

165
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:42,875
Come with us.
There's tons of room here.

166
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:49,583
<i>The night is young,
full of lustful promises</i>

167
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:50,875
Yeah...

168
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,500
The screen is that way!

169
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:03,791
<i>You always fail at love.
I burn in love</i>

170
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:07,791
<i>Our names are notorious</i>

171
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,666
<i>I could use you</i>

172
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:13,041
<i>Don't think too much</i>

173
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:16,750
<i>I 'II leave the world behind for you.
Why worry?</i>

174
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:21,375
<i>The beauty conquers your heart</i>

175
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:26,125
<i>The beauty conquers your heart</i>

176
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:28,208
<i>The beauty conquers...</i>

177
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,791
Shaadi.com calling.
Yes, Pandey?

178
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:39,250
Celebrate? Celebrate what?

179
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:44,083
Are you drunk?
I'll be there tomorrow.

180
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:48,833
- What is it?
- Nothing.

181
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,000
Come one.

182
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:55,000

[english rap song]

185
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,791
Bring the three Khans with you.
Here I am, sweetheart.

186
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:11,791
Why did Pandey call you so early?

187
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:13,500
I have a bad feeling.

188
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:17,916
Mr. Singh...

189
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:21,875
...when's the wedding?

190
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,583
Rubbish!

191
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:27,333
Don't stick gum on my shoe
for your commission.

192
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:30,166
You've introduced me to many girls
for months.

193
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,583
I didn't like one.

194
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,750
What's so special about her?

195
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,833
I didn't care for active girls...

196
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,208
...why would an inactive girl
interest me?

197
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:39,291
- Inactive?
- Yes!

198
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:42,166
I told him, "Find me another bride."
Didn't I tell you?

199
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:43,750
- Yes.
- He's right.

200
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,291
I know what you were up to.

201
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:49,541
You should've told me before
hugging and kissing.

202
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:51,583
My God, what have you done?

203
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:54,125
What's wrong with her?

204
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,166
She's pretty and educated.

205
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:58,500
Comes from a good family.
Has a great job.

206
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:00,041
But...

207
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:03,041
- ...a few mechanical problems.
- Like what?

208
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,083
Technical hiccups.

209
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,666
He's not exactly a catch!

210
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:11,125
When he sits, his feet can't touch
the ground and he wants a beauty.

211
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:12,250
Right.

212
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,375
You were having...

213
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:15,583
...a love affair.

214
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:17,250
No.

215
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:19,833
Will you betray her?
Turn your back on love?

216
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,291
Love?

217
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:24,000
You didn't tell me. God forgive us.

218
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,083
No, bro.

219
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,125
What do you mean "no?"

220
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:31,250
It started 5 months ago,
on 27th January...

221
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:34,416
...you were looking at photos
of prospective brides...

222
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:36,541
...and I entered through that door.

223
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,083
<i>It was a miserable day.</i>

224
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:43,250
You came all the way from Meerut
in this terrible storm?

225
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:46,958
Bachelors at 38...

226
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,458
...aren't scared of storms.

227
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,958
You've seen so many photos.

228
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:54,625
No girl in Asia is worthy of you.

229
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:56,083
Shut up!

230
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:59,958
You lied to me. You hid this diamond
in a coal mine.

231
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:02,875
This.

232
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:06,500
- Where did you find this?
- In your desk drawer.

233
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:11,708
She's unavailable. 80 I hid it.

234
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:16,541
I've paid you so much,
you should be available to me too.

235
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:18,541
- What are you saying?
- What?

236
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:21,083
Mr. Singh, she's not for you.

237
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,375
I think she is.

238
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:26,416
My friend, she shakes a lot.

239
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:29,041
So I'll shake along with her.

240
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:30,791
Introduce us.

241
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,541
Don't take this road.

242
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:35,250
But I will.

243
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,208
Mr. Singh...

244
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:41,875
...even people who love in secret
end up married.

245
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:47,083
Aafla Yusufzai Bhinder'?
What kind of name is that?

246
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:50,375
Some people have the oddest names.
80 does she.

247
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:52,833
HalfAfghani, half Punjabi.

248
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,541
Blast! Then? What did you do?

249
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:57,958
Then?

250
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:00,000
I landed up at her address.

251
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:03,916
Amity Global School is proud
to Present our very own student...

252
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:05,666
...from the batch of 2001.

253
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:08,000
Apart from finding
water fossils on Mars...

254
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,833
...her latest achievement is creating
a zero gravity simulator on earth.

255
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:14,791
My dear students, please welcome NSAR
senior scientist...

256
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:17,250
...Miss Aafia Yusufzai Bhinder.

257
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,000
Good heavens!

258
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:32,416
There was no wheelchair in the photo.

259
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,375
Good morning, students.

260
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:40,791
- What?
- Girls only here. Scoot!

261
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:41,916
Fine, fine.

262
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:43,458
Stop!

263
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:46,916
- Where are you going?
- Nowhere!

264
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:49,916
- Why are you in fancy dress?
- It's my birthday.

265
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:51,791
- And those doves?
- Which ones?

266
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,083
- Give them to me.
- Stop!

267
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:56,666
They cost 5000 for the pair, idiot.

268
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:58,250
Insulting me? What class are you in?

269
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:02,625
If I had married in time,
I'd have brats like you by now.

270
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:03,708
Don't pull my ear.

271
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,791
No pulling.

272
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:08,041
Let go. I'll bite you.

273
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:09,833
No organ pulling.

274
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:20,666
Did Pandey send you?

275
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:25,833
Bauua Singh?

276
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,125
Singh.

277
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:30,625
Singh.

278
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:33,208
Singh.

279
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:36,958
I didn't know my name had
a whistle in it. Say it again.

280
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,416
What's wrong? You're leaving?

281
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:45,041
Listen to me!

282
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:49,083
I brought a pair of doves for you...

283
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:52,250
...but those brats let them escape.
Please take this.

284
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:55,625
Like doves, thorns do not fear dying.

285
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,875
For you...

286
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:00,625
Isn't that a Dilip Kumar line?

287
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:03,916
You're no Madhubala either.
It's a compliment. Keep it.

288
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:15,208
The canteen here has great snacks.

289
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,791
Want some?

290
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:20,916
You want her autograph?
Queue up.

291
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:23,458
Aren't kids nasty?

292
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:26,500
[indistinct chatter]

293
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:32,250
What made you think you could
ever marry me?

294
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:37,333
Me? Marry?
Who pays for looking?

295
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,791
I was just window-shopping.

296
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:44,000
Do you know who I am?

297
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,750
You found water on Mars or something?

298
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:50,541
You should look for water in Meerut.
It's cut off for days there.

299
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:55,416
Looks like your brain's even smaller
than you are.

300
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:59,083
The way you're guzzling down
those pakodas...

301
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:00,958
...dipping them in chutney...

302
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:05,208
...I bet you haven't passed 7th grade.

303
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:07,458
10th grade, actually.

304
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:08,583
10th grade.

305
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:11,166
Students!

306
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,666
What should we do with this man?

307
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:18,833
Kill him!

308
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:21,541
Watch it!

309
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:24,833
May your mother elope with a barber!
Don't touch me. I'll hit you.

310
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:26,041
Wait.

311
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:30,875
Be polite and see
this uncle to the door.

312
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:33,083
Uncle? I'm only 38.

313
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,625
You...

314
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,750
- Then?
- Then what?

315
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:51,458
Chill, bro. I went home.

316
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:55,666
- Look! What is this?
- Shall I explain?

317
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:56,791
What...

318
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:59,958
- Brother...
- Yes.

319
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:01,166
What is this?

320
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,500
A dance contest.

321
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,750
The winner will attend
a party with Babita Kumari.

322
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,083
- Really?
- Yes.

323
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:12,375
Add my name then. I can dance.

324
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:15,000
- Hey...
- Shall I make you dance?

325
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:16,625
So what happened next?

326
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:19,000
You're playing the innocent.
You must've done it!

327
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:20,000
The truth.

328
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:25,000
I first roasted
those cursed doves.

329
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:31,833
- This chicken is tiny.
- It's a dwarf.

330
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:34,166
God forgive us!

331
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,541
<i>As usual my father kept saying
I was a good-for-nothing.</i>

332
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:41,083
He's been sucking my blood.

333
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:42,250
<i>Exhausted, he fell asleep.</i>

334
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,750
5...4...3...2...1...0..

335
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,541
<i>I couldn't sleep.</i>

336
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:49,375
<i>That mean girl,
that Shahid Kapoor lookalike.</i>

337
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:52,625
<i>5000 angels of death swooped
past me.</i>

<i>Dad stopped me.</i>

340
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:00,958
Don't empty the sky.

341
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:04,375
You should sell tickets
for your magic show.

342
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:05,958
Lend me 500 rupees.

343
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:07,666
Shall I take my belt off?

344
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:11,083
What belt? Are you going to hit me
with your drawstring?

345
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,583
<i>It was pointless living
Without taking revenge.</i>

346
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:17,541
<i>I wanted sweet revenge.</i>

347
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:20,166
We have decided to perhaps...

348
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:21,666
Hello...Hello...

349
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:23,916
Hello, hello, my loose cannon.

350
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:29,083
You may have found water on Mars
or tomatoes elsewhere, so what?

351
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:31,500
Did it help you?

352
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,958
Don't laugh too much!

353
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:37,791
You humiliated me in front of
5000 people yesterday. My turn now.

354
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:39,416
Brothers and sisters...

355
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:44,208
Sure, I could've been taller!
But she's no lanky Amitabh Bachchan.

356
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:47,333
I'm small in stature
but my limbs work.

357
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:50,250
All she can do is shake.

358
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:54,250
Give me that pen.
I'll show you something.

359
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:57,291
If this pen falls...

360
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:03,083
...I can pick it up.
But she can't.

361
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:08,166
Bauua Singh may be uneducated
and live off his father...

362
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,250
...but I can stand on my own two feet.

363
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:14,708
Let's see her pick up the pen.

364
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:15,958
Come on.

365
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:19,125
Keep watching her.
Look Where you're going, mister.

366
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,416
"The kid-faced Devil"

367
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:12,291
"Nasty dwarf“

368
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:18,833
<i>She could not lift the pen
but she touched my heart.</i>

369
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:23,541
<i>I'm used to my father's insults,
so it wasn't her insulting me.</i>

370
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,250
<i>The problem was she didn't
even stare at me.</i>

371
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:32,500
<i>I'm a dwarf! People pay money
to see dwarves in a circus.</i>

372
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:36,000
<i>It would've cost her nothing.
But she didn't look twice.</i>

373
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:40,458
<i>For me, it was double or quits.</i>

374
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:45,000
<i>No more doves.
Time for a bouquet.</i>

375
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,000
[indistinct chatter]

376
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:07,375
Long live the Goddess!

377
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:10,083


378
00:23:10,958 --> 00:23:13,958
"Don't take me for a stone.
Don't turn away, my rose.

379
00:23:17,416 --> 00:23:22,083
"Like dew, I only caressed
your cheeks.“

380
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:29,250
That line isn't Dilip Kumar's.
It's mine. I wrote it for you.

381
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:36,750
Aafia, till 3.30 last night,
I despised you.

382
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,541
At 3.45, I was in love with you.

383
00:23:39,541 --> 00:23:40,750
Really?

384
00:23:41,708 --> 00:23:44,041
Straight to love?

385
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:44,875
Yes.

386
00:23:46,416 --> 00:23:48,458
I thought you were crushed.

387
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:50,958
Right word?

388
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:54,791
Yes! Crushed is the right word.

389
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:58,458
God has had His will.
No one on earth can help me now.

390
00:23:58,958 --> 00:24:01,375
I came to apologise.

391
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:03,250
It's customary to bring flowers.

392
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:05,958
May I...?

393
00:24:10,666 --> 00:24:13,125
Never mind, it's OK.

394
00:24:14,125 --> 00:24:17,583
Size does not matter to dreams.

395
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:20,500
This small man has dreamed of you.

396
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:25,333
- I'm so sorry about that.
- Forgive me, Aafia.

397
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:27,791
Well...shall I go?

398
00:24:28,958 --> 00:24:29,916
Whereabout...

399
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,791
Stop me from walking away.

400
00:24:33,791 --> 00:24:37,625
O Goddess, will You crush me again?
Blast you, Pandey.

401
00:24:37,625 --> 00:24:40,041
Nice girls for everyone.
And you find her for me?

402
00:24:40,458 --> 00:24:43,166
She humiliated me again
in front of everyone.

403
00:24:46,666 --> 00:24:48,916
"Don't take me for a stone.
Don't turn away, my rose.

404
00:24:48,916 --> 00:24:51,250
"Like dew, I only caressed
your cheeks.“

405
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,625
That's my line not Dilip Kumar's.

406
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:55,791
Ti” 3.30 last night, I despised you.

407
00:24:55,791 --> 00:24:57,333
At 3.45, I was in love with you.

408
00:24:57,333 --> 00:25:00,916
God has had His will.
No one on earth can help me now.

409
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:05,000
Size does not matter to dreams.
This small man has dreamed of you.

410
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,166
I came to apologise.

411
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:08,375
This time I've brought you a plant.

412
00:25:08,375 --> 00:25:10,041
Please accept it.

413
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:16,708
I'm off. I'm going.

414
00:25:17,541 --> 00:25:19,083
I'm leaving. Promise.

415
00:25:20,916 --> 00:25:22,375
Have some shame!

416
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,333
Stop me this time!

417
00:25:26,208 --> 00:25:31,000
Get rid of your dimple.
Don't act over-smart.

418
00:25:31,333 --> 00:25:34,041
Then I might talk to you.

419
00:25:34,041 --> 00:25:36,458
I didn't buy my dimples.

420
00:25:36,458 --> 00:25:39,250
I was born with them.
God's gift, ma'am.

421
00:25:39,458 --> 00:25:42,333
What do you want?

422
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:44,416
I've come from so far to meet you.

423
00:25:44,416 --> 00:25:48,416
You could offer me tea, coffee,
a cold drink or wine.

424
00:25:56,166 --> 00:25:58,125
Here. Drink up.

425
00:25:58,833 --> 00:26:02,125
If I had to drink alone...

426
00:26:02,791 --> 00:26:04,583
...a Meerut bar would do.

427
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:05,791
Have one.

428
00:26:06,041 --> 00:26:07,041
Go on!

429
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:14,166
Cheers! To your smile.

430
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:31,041
Aafia, if you're unlucky,
we'll meet again.

431
00:26:33,166 --> 00:26:36,750
Won't you ask me
to pick up a pen today?

432
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:41,916
You'll take my life, Aafla.
What's a pen?

433
00:26:41,916 --> 00:26:46,208
Can I be cheeky and request you
to dance with me?

434
00:26:48,708 --> 00:26:50,083
I can't dance.

435
00:26:50,291 --> 00:26:53,916
I used to think I could never love.

436
00:26:54,833 --> 00:26:57,375
Give yourself a chance, my sweet lady.

437
00:27:01,708 --> 00:27:02,708
DJ!

438
00:27:02,958 --> 00:27:03,708
Yes, sir.

439
00:27:03,708 --> 00:27:05,708
Play a Shammi Kapoor song.

440
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,500
Don't have any.

441
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,000
<i>ARM“ Kapoor song?</i>

442
00:27:09,375 --> 00:27:10,208
Well...

443
00:27:10,375 --> 00:27:13,625
Play a song by any one
of the Kapoor dynasty.

444
00:27:14,208 --> 00:27:14,791
Yes.

445
00:27:16,125 --> 00:27:17,333
A Shashi Kapoor number?

446
00:27:19,083 --> 00:27:20,083
Play it!

447
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:25,208
O <i>my God!</i>

448
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:43,958

00:27:58,125 --> 00:28:02,666
<i>...fallen in love with you</i>

453
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,916
O <i>my God!</i>

00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:31,666
<i>My heart tells me</i>

455

00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:38,375
<i>My heart tells me</i>

00:28:38,666 --> 00:28:41,041
<i>It's God's truth</i>

<i>The world does not believe it...</i>

459
00:28:48,833 --> 00:28:52,208
<i>The world does not believe it...</i>

460
00:28:52,208 --> 00:28:55,583
<i>...but I'm crazy about you</i>

461

462
00:28:57,333 --> 00:29:00,166
<i>...I'm not a dark cloud,
I'm only a shadow</i>

463
00:29:00,166 --> 00:29:03,041
<i>You have...</i>

464
00:29:03,583 --> 00:29:08,583
<i>...fallen in love with me</i>

465
00:29:09,166 --> 00:29:11,333
O <i>my God!</i>

466
00:29:14,291 --> 00:29:15,375
How is it?

467
00:29:19,083 --> 00:29:20,791
Another drink?

468
00:29:23,041 --> 00:29:27,291
The rover that went to Mars,
what's it called?

469
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:30,375
Goodness! I'm so drunk!

470
00:29:30,875 --> 00:29:32,500
<i>Yes. . Sun“?</i>

471
00:29:34,083 --> 00:29:35,000
No.

472
00:29:35,833 --> 00:29:38,541
- It's called...
- "Velocity."

473
00:29:38,541 --> 00:29:41,375
- "Velocity."
- I knew that.

474
00:29:41,625 --> 00:29:48,250
Who asked NSAR to send
a rover to Mars?

475
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:51,416
Velocity was sent by...whom?

476
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:54,291
- Who sent it?
- I did.

477
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:55,791
Is that so?

478
00:29:57,208 --> 00:29:58,250
- I see...
- And...

479
00:29:59,125 --> 00:30:04,875
...who told NSAR that Velocity
should dig...

480
00:30:04,875 --> 00:30:07,041
...more than travel?

481
00:30:07,041 --> 00:30:08,250
Who did?

482
00:30:08,833 --> 00:30:10,083
I did.

483
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,458
Amazing.

484
00:30:12,458 --> 00:30:15,375
Who told them...

485
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:20,500
...we should send a man to Mars now?

486
00:30:21,791 --> 00:30:23,000
It's time.

487
00:30:23,333 --> 00:30:25,208
- Who did?
- I did.

488
00:30:28,708 --> 00:30:30,333
Who said...

489
00:30:31,708 --> 00:30:37,791
...we should find cheaper ways
of doing it from India?

490
00:30:38,166 --> 00:30:40,583
- That's why I'm here.
- Who?

491
00:30:41,541 --> 00:30:43,250
Me. In India.

492
00:30:44,833 --> 00:30:46,000
I came.

493
00:30:46,958 --> 00:30:49,250
If you're here in India,
it must be you.

494
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:52,625
- Amazing. You came here...
- Excuse me.

495
00:30:52,958 --> 00:30:55,916
Can you give me one
more drink, please?

496
00:30:55,916 --> 00:30:57,750
Sorry, ma'am, the bar's closed.

497
00:30:59,916 --> 00:31:03,833
She found water on Mars,
and you refuse her a drink?

498
00:31:04,708 --> 00:31:05,750
Look at her!

499
00:31:07,125 --> 00:31:10,125
OK. Don't look.
Aafia, shall I hit him?

500
00:31:20,333 --> 00:31:23,166
The toilet is shaking.
Give me a sip.

501
00:31:26,791 --> 00:31:28,083
Try some lemon.

502
00:31:31,666 --> 00:31:34,833
So who told...?

503
00:31:35,291 --> 00:31:38,250
Enough, my friend.
Is NSAR all we can talk about?

504
00:31:38,416 --> 00:31:43,625
Do I brag about saving Satish's shop
when the council came to destroy it?

505
00:31:45,958 --> 00:31:47,291


506
00:31:47,708 --> 00:31:48,375
Right.

507
00:31:48,541 --> 00:31:51,208
They came with bulldozers
to raze it to the ground.

508
00:31:51,458 --> 00:31:54,916
Do I brag? I did this.
I did that. Doesn't sound good.

509
00:31:55,708 --> 00:31:59,208
Are you making fun of me?
Naughty!

510
00:32:00,208 --> 00:32:01,916
Acting over-smart again?

511
00:32:03,291 --> 00:32:06,708
But no dimples this time!
It still worked, no?

512
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:12,166
Shut up! I need to take a leak.

513
00:32:13,083 --> 00:32:14,208
Where's the leak?

514
00:32:15,916 --> 00:32:20,708
Duffer! I need the toilet, to pee.

515
00:32:22,458 --> 00:32:23,541
Ohh...

516
00:32:23,833 --> 00:32:25,708
What must I do?

517
00:32:26,625 --> 00:32:31,125
You? I'm the one who has to do it.

518
00:32:31,875 --> 00:32:35,083
I'll wait outside.
Call me when you're done.

519
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:38,166
Outside? You're my friend.

520
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:41,750
Stay put. Just turn around.

521
00:32:42,083 --> 00:32:44,875
We're in the Ladies.
There may be some aunties around.

522
00:32:45,458 --> 00:32:48,166
I'll deal with them.
Don't be mistaken.

523
00:32:48,375 --> 00:32:49,791
I'm not your friend.

524
00:33:02,416 --> 00:33:06,208
If I said I was your friend,
would you have let me stay?

525
00:33:07,166 --> 00:33:09,791
- Oh my God!
- Come in, aunty. I'm only a kid.

526
00:33:10,958 --> 00:33:16,125
I found water on Mars
and the rascal won't give me a drink.

527
00:33:16,125 --> 00:33:19,958
- Come here.
- Now I'll look for alcohol on Mars.

528
00:33:38,875 --> 00:33:40,541
You didn't answer me.

529
00:33:40,958 --> 00:33:44,541
If I said I was your friend,
could I have stayed?

530
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:50,708
- You missed your chance.
- No way.

531
00:33:51,416 --> 00:33:55,125
If I went for this chance,
I might lose other chances.

532
00:33:55,916 --> 00:33:58,791
God forbid I ever become your friend!

533
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:04,166
- Shut up!
- OK.

534
00:34:04,166 --> 00:34:07,416
- And good night.
- OK. I'm gone.

535
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:12,666
Aafia, did anyone tell you...

536
00:34:12,666 --> 00:34:16,333
...how pretty sweat looks
on your face?

537
00:34:16,541 --> 00:34:19,541
Yes. Mummy did.

538
00:34:21,791 --> 00:34:25,208
You'll look even prettier with colour
on you. It's Holi tomorrow!

539
00:34:25,416 --> 00:34:27,583
Play Holi with me.

540
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:30,291
Money back if you don't have fun.

541
00:34:30,583 --> 00:34:34,083
Don't forget your place, Bauua Singh.

542
00:34:34,083 --> 00:34:37,958
I'm way out of your league.

543
00:34:39,916 --> 00:34:42,791
That's really big of you, Aafla.

544
00:34:44,375 --> 00:34:47,625
I can find dozens like you.

545
00:34:47,625 --> 00:34:49,500
Why like me?

546
00:34:49,916 --> 00:34:54,083
- I like uneducated types.
- I can be the intellectual gent.

547
00:34:54,291 --> 00:34:56,583
I've seen many English films.

548
00:34:56,583 --> 00:35:00,458
Now I'll say goodnight.

549
00:35:01,791 --> 00:35:05,375
Stand there if you
want to waste your time.

550
00:35:09,791 --> 00:35:10,791
Bauua!

551
00:35:18,166 --> 00:35:19,208
Bauua!

552
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:23,458
Are you there?

553
00:35:24,375 --> 00:35:27,791
So your head was against the door.
Like this?

554
00:35:28,916 --> 00:35:32,166
How romantic! Standing at her door.
Then?

555
00:35:32,375 --> 00:35:33,916
The usual.

556
00:35:33,916 --> 00:35:35,250
What? Romance?

557
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:37,500
No, fool! A song.

558
00:35:38,125 --> 00:35:43,416
<i>Guddu, the orchestra cost 250,000.
150,000 for their costumes.</i>

559
00:35:43,666 --> 00:35:47,041
<i>50,000 bribe for the
imperial Hotel's manager.</i>

560
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:51,666
<i>80,000 to hire the nasty kids.
20,000 for colour sprays.</i>

561
00:35:51,875 --> 00:35:54,375
<i>Plus my suit at 150,000.</i>

562
00:35:54,375 --> 00:35:59,250
<i>I didn't want to, but ended up
spending 600,000 of Dad's money.</i>

563
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:04,291
<i>Thanks to the Goddess,
at last the girl looked at this dwarf.</i>

564
00:36:23,291 --> 00:36:27,083
<i>A colour has no colour...</i>

565
00:36:27,375 --> 00:36:32,541
<i>...Ifltdoesnotmamhmecolwr
dyowlbs.</i>

566
00:36:35,208 --> 00:36:39,166
<i>A fragrance has no fragrance...</i>

567
00:36:39,375 --> 00:36:45,250
<i>...if it does not match the fragrance
of your dark hair.</i>

568
00:36:47,291 --> 00:36:51,291
<i>The world pales next to you</i>

569
00:36:51,291 --> 00:36:55,375
<i>You can only be mine</i>

570
00:36:55,375 --> 00:37:02,083
<i>Everyone can see it.
I say this out loud:</i>

571
00:37:03,916 --> 00:37:07,708
<i>As long as there's
light in the world...</i>

572
00:37:08,041 --> 00:37:11,333
<i>...you'll belong to me</i>

573
00:37:12,041 --> 00:37:16,041
<i>As long as I live in this world...</i>

574
00:37:16,041 --> 00:37:19,333
<i>...you'll belong to me</i>

575
00:37:19,958 --> 00:37:23,666
<i>As long as there's
light in the world...</i>

576
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:27,500
<i>...you'll belong to me</i>

577
00:37:28,083 --> 00:37:31,791
<i>As long as I live in this world...</i>

578
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:35,000
<i>...you'll belong to me</i>

579
00:38:16,041 --> 00:38:24,000
<i>I am your confusion.
I am your solution</i>

580
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,958
<i>I'm a little stubborn</i>

581
00:38:27,958 --> 00:38:31,208
<i>A little crazy too</i>

582
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:35,083
<i>How false are the clouds
and spring showers</i>

583
00:38:35,083 --> 00:38:39,416
<i>How false is offering
a gift of flowers</i>

584
00:38:39,416 --> 00:38:43,041
<i>Only you are real.
Only I am real</i>

585
00:38:43,041 --> 00:38:47,333
<i>My heart speaks the only truth</i>

586
00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:51,416
<i>Etch your name on my heart
with your lovely hands</i>

587
00:38:51,416 --> 00:38:59,041
<i>Open your eyes to my love.
Do I ask too much of you?</i>

588
00:38:59,041 --> 00:39:04,083
<i>I say this out loud:</i>

589
00:39:04,083 --> 00:39:08,041
<i>As long as there's light
in the world...</i>

590

<i>...you'll belong to me</i>

<i>As long as I live in this world...</i>

592

594
00:39:24,041 --> 00:39:27,500
<i>...you'll belong to me</i>

595
00:39:28,041 --> 00:39:32,041
<i>As long as I live in this world...</i>

596
00:39:32,041 --> 00:39:35,166
<i>...you'll belong to me</i>

597
00:39:55,875 --> 00:40:02,791
<i>Forever you will sway
in my loving arms</i>

598
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:10,916
<i>Like the earth sways
in the arms of the sun</i>

599
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:18,250
<i>You will never be apart from me</i>

600
00:40:19,416 --> 00:40:26,333
<i>Forever you will be a part of me</i>

601
00:40:31,333 --> 00:40:35,375
<i>Shatter all my dreams if you wish</i>

602
00:40:35,375 --> 00:40:39,375
<i>The shards of my dreams
will still dream of you</i>

603
00:40:39,375 --> 00:40:42,750
<i>You are my inspiration</i>

604
00:40:43,041 --> 00:40:45,958
<i>I say this out loud:</i>

605
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:56,000
<i>As long as I live in this world...</i>

606
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,208
<i>...you'll belong to me</i>

607
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:03,875
<i>As long as I live in this world...</i>

608
00:41:04,083 --> 00:41:07,250
<i>...you'll belong to me</i>

609
00:41:11,291 --> 00:41:12,666
My good sir!

610
00:41:13,833 --> 00:41:17,083
Your romancing will get my
family thrown out on the street.

611
00:41:17,083 --> 00:41:18,500
I'll be fired.

612
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:21,208
Shut up! <i>She's</i> coming round.

613
00:41:21,208 --> 00:41:23,875
I should shut up?
Pass me the agreement.

614
00:41:24,083 --> 00:41:27,083
Where does it say
you'll ruin this place?

615
00:41:27,416 --> 00:41:30,458
We agreed you'd spray colours,
there'd be some musicians...

616
00:41:30,458 --> 00:41:31,416
...that's all.

617
00:41:37,541 --> 00:41:38,750
Bauua.

618
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:41,750
Bauua, give me 100-rupees
and I'll tell you something.

619
00:41:45,458 --> 00:41:46,708
Your father wants you home.

620
00:41:46,708 --> 00:41:48,666
I paid you to hear this?

621
00:41:48,666 --> 00:41:51,083
Naughty! What's this?

622
00:41:51,291 --> 00:41:52,708
Lost your tongue?

623
00:41:52,708 --> 00:41:54,458
You sang to her.

624
00:41:54,708 --> 00:41:58,166
Now you're in love. What else?
Why deny it?

625
00:41:58,666 --> 00:42:03,541
She fell in love with me.
And I started loving myself.

626
00:42:06,291 --> 00:42:08,416
- Then?
- The usual.

627
00:42:08,416 --> 00:42:10,375
Another song? You just sang.

628
00:42:10,375 --> 00:42:11,208
No!

629
00:42:12,333 --> 00:42:13,458
Romance.

630
00:42:14,541 --> 00:42:16,125
God forgive us!

631
00:42:27,666 --> 00:42:29,541
Do you know...

632
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:33,875
...why the moon is sometimes
a half moon?

633
00:42:35,208 --> 00:42:36,000
Yes.

634
00:42:38,041 --> 00:42:43,708
Because the other half sits
on the Imperial Hotel balcony.

635
00:42:48,166 --> 00:42:51,041
- Trying to be smooth?
- Trying?

636
00:42:51,208 --> 00:42:54,000
Showing me your dimple,
making a fool of me.

637
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,750
I know your ways.

638
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:57,625
Well...

639
00:43:01,291 --> 00:43:03,375
...let me try another technique.

640
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:07,208
Look!

641
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,291
Ten...nine...eight..zero.

642
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:25,375
Do it...

643
00:43:26,541 --> 00:43:27,541
...again.

644
00:43:29,416 --> 00:43:32,625
Ten...nine...eight...

645
00:43:32,916 --> 00:43:34,166
...zero.

646
00:43:44,041 --> 00:43:47,333
How did you do it?

647
00:43:52,833 --> 00:43:55,041
Would you make the moon fall too?

648
00:44:04,166 --> 00:44:06,416
Ten...nine...eight...

649
00:44:31,541 --> 00:44:32,791
Never mind!

650
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,250
There's only one moon.

651
00:44:55,416 --> 00:44:56,625
So...

652
00:44:57,083 --> 00:45:01,000
...if we get intimate now...

653
00:45:03,666 --> 00:45:07,000
...yourjob's done, right?

654
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:12,625
It's all you wanted?

655
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,166
That's what I thought, but...

656
00:45:18,791 --> 00:45:20,041
But?

657
00:45:22,291 --> 00:45:23,666
But...

658
00:45:25,458 --> 00:45:27,541
...it's hard for me to say this.

659
00:45:27,833 --> 00:45:29,666
It's insulting for me...

660
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:31,291
...but...

661
00:45:33,208 --> 00:45:34,708
...I'm in love with you.

662
00:45:45,583 --> 00:45:47,791
Wait. What are you doing?

663
00:45:49,166 --> 00:45:51,000
Don't go. I'll be back.

664
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:11,250
What a scandal! Then?

665
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:14,458
It's a month since that night.
Haven't seen her since.

666
00:46:14,666 --> 00:46:17,208
I've got a new SIM card
and a new number.

667
00:46:17,416 --> 00:46:20,500
Don't fly too high! Clever
crows can end up eating crap too.

668
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:24,166
I've had my share of crap.
I'll just be the clever crow now.

669
00:46:24,166 --> 00:46:25,583
And fly high.

670
00:46:25,583 --> 00:46:28,000
You did her wrong.

671
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,083
- God will take His revenge.
- What more revenge can He take?

672
00:46:32,083 --> 00:46:35,875
Remember when my father used to pay
tax in advance? I've paid too.

673
00:46:36,083 --> 00:46:39,250
And if God asks me, why this?
Why that?

674
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:42,666
We cover our faces.

675
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:45,416
Don't believe her.

676
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,750
Blast you, Pandey.

677
00:46:48,458 --> 00:46:50,291
- What is it?
- Can you eat sweets?

678
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:51,708
What?

679
00:46:52,125 --> 00:46:53,083
Dear...

680
00:46:54,083 --> 00:46:55,875
He's back. Wait a second.

681
00:46:59,041 --> 00:47:03,375
- Come here.
- I don't know her. Listen.

682
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:06,791
What's going on?

683
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:08,583
Look at me.

684
00:47:09,458 --> 00:47:10,916
Are you duping her?

685
00:47:11,916 --> 00:47:13,166
Bauua!

686
00:47:13,833 --> 00:47:14,708
Scoundrel.

687
00:47:14,708 --> 00:47:19,541
You talk non-stop.
Cat got your tongue now?

688
00:47:20,208 --> 00:47:22,041
That's our Bauua.

689
00:47:23,416 --> 00:47:24,791
Yes, I know.

690
00:47:25,125 --> 00:47:28,708
You don't get it? He's always
going to look small.

691
00:47:30,708 --> 00:47:36,416
I won't look different
25 years from now either.

692
00:47:37,416 --> 00:47:38,291
True.

693
00:47:38,708 --> 00:47:40,125
You're lucky.

694
00:47:40,291 --> 00:47:42,625
You found a girl who'll marry you.

695
00:47:43,708 --> 00:47:46,291
Even boys would say no.

696
00:47:48,291 --> 00:47:50,375
Playing games with her?

697
00:47:59,666 --> 00:48:05,166
Fix the wedding date.

698
00:48:05,458 --> 00:48:07,583
An auspicious day. Hurry.

699
00:48:07,833 --> 00:48:12,125
He's getting married at last!

700
00:48:12,833 --> 00:48:15,625
He's finally getting married.

701
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:18,125
I am not getting married.

702
00:48:18,333 --> 00:48:20,375
I'll hang myself.

703
00:48:20,375 --> 00:48:21,708
- Listen Ashok.
- How will he hang himself?

704
00:48:21,708 --> 00:48:22,916
Where's everybody?

705
00:48:23,125 --> 00:48:23,875
Aunty.

706
00:48:24,625 --> 00:48:26,666
- Guddu, let's celebrate.
- Celebrate?

707
00:48:26,666 --> 00:48:28,958
How can you all eat?

708
00:48:28,958 --> 00:48:30,708
He'll commit suicide.

709
00:48:30,708 --> 00:48:32,666
- Who?
- Bauua. who else?

710
00:48:32,666 --> 00:48:36,125
Listen, Guddu.
That's just typical of him.

711
00:48:36,125 --> 00:48:39,750
He shouts his head off.
No one can say a word to him.

712
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,541
Before anyone calls him a dwarf...

713
00:48:41,541 --> 00:48:44,666
...he stuffs money in their face.
Or pelts stones.

714
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:47,666
His strutting is a sham.

715
00:48:48,375 --> 00:48:51,791
I'll buy you a shop
if that dog commits suicide.

716
00:48:51,791 --> 00:48:54,208
God! What kind of mother are you?

717
00:48:54,666 --> 00:48:55,541
The real thing.

718
00:48:57,875 --> 00:48:59,750
Yes, listen.

719
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:02,000
I want 75 boxes of sweet.

720
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,583
Not 80, 75.

721
00:49:06,666 --> 00:49:07,833
Move aside.

722
00:49:07,833 --> 00:49:09,250
Fine, fine.

723
00:49:09,458 --> 00:49:11,916
Bauua, you're marinating here...

724
00:49:12,125 --> 00:49:14,416
...while the boys are jumping for joy.

725
00:49:14,416 --> 00:49:16,958
Shut those women up.
My head's splitting.

726
00:49:16,958 --> 00:49:19,541
Babita's coming to the Mall tonight.

727
00:49:19,833 --> 00:49:21,125
Babita, who?

728
00:49:22,708 --> 00:49:23,916
Babita, who?

729
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,250
Babita Kumari!

730
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:27,625
Your Mrs.

731
00:49:28,083 --> 00:49:29,250
My sister-in-law.

732
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:32,750
The one who'll enter this house
with bridal bells on her feet.

733
00:49:33,125 --> 00:49:36,208
The one who'll feed your children.

734
00:49:36,208 --> 00:49:39,625
The one who'll have henna
painted on her hands. Bauua Singh!

735
00:49:39,875 --> 00:49:41,125
The irony of love!

736
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:45,250
Before I die,
she has come to meet me. In person.

737
00:49:46,208 --> 00:49:47,458
God is Great!

738
00:49:47,833 --> 00:49:51,250
Don't rub any more inches off me.

739
00:50:00,083 --> 00:50:01,875
Get the scooter out, Guddu.

740
00:50:01,875 --> 00:50:05,083
<i>Fill my brow with stars!</i>

741
00:50:05,333 --> 00:50:10,541
<i>My beloved is here</i>

742
00:50:10,875 --> 00:50:12,083
Babita!

743
00:50:12,083 --> 00:50:14,000
- Jeelu da...
- Fast.

744
00:50:14,208 --> 00:50:15,750
Madam called you two minutes ago.

745
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:18,541
Babita, costume is ready.
Everything is ready. Now you...

746
00:50:18,958 --> 00:50:20,000
Oh!

747
00:50:20,583 --> 00:50:21,916
Did you bet?

748
00:50:22,708 --> 00:50:24,250
I'll bet 500.

749
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:25,708
Call him.

750
00:50:27,125 --> 00:50:28,750
He won't pick up.

751
00:50:28,958 --> 00:50:30,500
I know his father too.

752
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:31,916
All cons.

753
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:38,791
Best of three.

754
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,125
<i>The number you're trying to reach
is currently busy.</i>

755
00:50:48,125 --> 00:50:50,958
How about the best of five, ma'am?

756
00:50:51,583 --> 00:50:53,833
<i>The number you're trying to reach...</i>

757
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:04,416
Shall I call back?

758
00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:08,916
OK. Let's try.

759
00:51:16,875 --> 00:51:20,041
<i>The customer you're calling
is unavailable.</i>

760
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:28,708
Can I come in?

761
00:51:29,333 --> 00:51:31,000
Yes. No one's bathing.

762
00:51:31,791 --> 00:51:33,291
Madam, shall we leave?

763
00:51:34,166 --> 00:51:36,791
It's a 3-hour drive to Meerut.

764
00:51:40,875 --> 00:51:41,791
Okay.

765
00:51:44,416 --> 00:51:45,500
How much did I lose?

766
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:48,458
25,000. But you can pay 15,000.

767
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:56,791
Here. Go, get my bag.
I'll pay the rest later.

768
00:51:57,041 --> 00:51:59,541
It's already in the car.
You please get ready.

769
00:52:02,041 --> 00:52:04,583
- Shall we go?
- Hello! Costume, make-up and hair.

770
00:52:11,875 --> 00:52:13,333
Clothes done.

771
00:52:14,125 --> 00:52:16,500
Hair done.

772
00:52:19,166 --> 00:52:22,041
I'm so pretty. Don't need make-up.

773
00:52:25,416 --> 00:52:27,791
<i>Your love's fake.</i>

774
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,250
<i>I've seen how selfish you are.</i>

775
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:32,541
<i>Every day you get a new arm candy.</i>

776
00:52:32,541 --> 00:52:35,333
<i>I am high on your betrayal.</i>

777
00:52:40,583 --> 00:52:42,125
Take a look here.

778
00:52:43,458 --> 00:52:44,958
Stop going crazy.

779
00:52:45,666 --> 00:52:47,958
<i>Your love's fake.</i>

780
00:52:48,166 --> 00:52:50,500
<i>I've seen how selfish you are.</i>

781
00:52:50,708 --> 00:52:52,750
<i>Every day you get a new arm candy.</i>

782
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:54,583
<i>I am high on your betrayal.</i>

783
00:52:54,583 --> 00:52:55,750
Babita!

784
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:58,000
<i>You go to god and tell...</i>

785
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:00,583
<i>That you swindle everyone,</i>

786
00:53:00,791 --> 00:53:05,416
<i>There is a blame on you,
come and listen.</i>

787
00:53:07,208 --> 00:53:08,458
SC *** you

788
00:53:08,458 --> 00:53:11,291
<i>You have defamed her, defamed her,</i>

789
00:53:11,291 --> 00:53:13,750
<i>- Mfllhyourfakalova</i>

790
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:15,500
She proposed to you.

791
00:53:16,666 --> 00:53:18,041
I love you!

792
00:53:18,333 --> 00:53:20,208
I love you too.

793
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:23,250
<i>With your fake love</i>

794
00:53:41,375 --> 00:53:44,250
Babita, my love look at me once.

795
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:46,291
Bauua, faster.

796
00:53:46,291 --> 00:53:49,500
- You want me to fly like a helicopter?
- Step on it.

797
00:53:49,916 --> 00:53:52,041
Move aside!

798
00:53:54,625 --> 00:53:56,041
Bauua, where are you going?

799
00:53:56,041 --> 00:53:59,375
- Are you following your mother?
- No, your sister.

800
00:53:59,375 --> 00:54:01,916
- Your daughter.
- No, my sister-in-law.

801
00:54:01,916 --> 00:54:03,083
Understand.

802
00:54:03,666 --> 00:54:06,208
I'll teach you a lesson.

803
00:54:06,208 --> 00:54:07,750
We'll get you.

804
00:54:09,166 --> 00:54:10,708
Give him one.

805
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,708
- Don't flash your torch. Kick him.
- Hold on.

806
00:54:15,291 --> 00:54:17,416
- I can't see them.
- They're behind us.

807
00:54:17,416 --> 00:54:20,833
You blinded me in one eye
when we were kids. Remember?

808
00:54:20,833 --> 00:54:22,708
- I can't see.
- Kick now!

809
00:54:22,708 --> 00:54:25,250
- You.
- Get off.

810
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,583
I paid for your mother's surgery...

811
00:54:32,583 --> 00:54:35,000
...why follow my bride? You dog.

812
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,458
- IslhatAcchan?
- Yes.

813
00:54:36,458 --> 00:54:38,750
Here. Pay your father's bail.

814
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:41,750
Grab it. Get your sister married.

815
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:44,291
Grab it.

816
00:54:44,291 --> 00:54:45,666
Watch it.

817
00:54:48,958 --> 00:54:50,791
Guddu, there's still
some jokers around.

818
00:54:50,791 --> 00:54:53,541
Push them under the bus.

819
00:54:54,125 --> 00:54:56,083
Guddu, hold on tight.

820
00:54:56,083 --> 00:54:58,416
Pull the banner.

821
00:55:08,166 --> 00:55:09,625
Got them all.

822
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:15,666
Stop the car.

823
00:55:16,916 --> 00:55:19,291
- Pull over.
- Babita, what are you doing?

824
00:55:23,375 --> 00:55:26,458
What happened?
What's going on?

825
00:55:26,708 --> 00:55:28,666
Babita Kumari's car has stopped.

826
00:55:29,041 --> 00:55:30,125
Her car?

827
00:55:30,708 --> 00:55:32,125
She's coming out.

828
00:55:32,125 --> 00:55:33,416
- Out?
- Yes.

829
00:55:34,916 --> 00:55:37,750
Guddu, she's calling me.

830
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:41,000
- God! But why?
- How would I know Why?

831
00:55:41,208 --> 00:55:42,750
Go!

832
00:56:13,125 --> 00:56:14,416
Do you love me?

833
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:20,166
Do you love me?

834
00:56:22,041 --> 00:56:23,375
Love you too.

835
00:56:28,416 --> 00:56:29,708
I loved him.

836
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:33,208
But I guess all you men
just have that...

837
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:36,166
...cheating gene in your DNA.

838
00:56:36,583 --> 00:56:37,583
No, no...

839
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,750
I like you in shorts,
I like you in jeans too.

840
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Same, same.

841
00:56:42,291 --> 00:56:46,208
- I want to kill all you bloody men.
- No kill, Babitaji.

842
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:48,291
Already dead, dead.

843
00:56:57,250 --> 00:57:00,000
Go back to your pathetic life...

844
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:05,250
...in your pathetic town
and spend the rest of your life...

845
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:09,125
...telling everyone that
Babita Kumari kissed you.

846
00:57:09,916 --> 00:57:12,166
No one will believe you.

847
00:57:13,833 --> 00:57:16,625
No one will ever believe you.

848
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:24,208
No one will ever believe me
that I loved him so much.

849
00:57:26,708 --> 00:57:30,958
So much that I'm crying
for that pathetic man.

850
00:57:31,708 --> 00:57:33,375
I'm crying for...

851
00:57:35,041 --> 00:57:36,750
I hate myself.

852
00:57:37,083 --> 00:57:38,458
I hate myself...

853
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:40,875
Babita.

854
00:57:41,041 --> 00:57:43,666
- Bauua!
- Come. Easy, easy.

855
00:57:43,666 --> 00:57:44,708
Bauua.

856
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:48,375
You left me alone in the dark.

857
00:57:50,458 --> 00:57:52,500
Where's Bauua?
Has she taken him away?

858
00:57:52,708 --> 00:57:53,625
Guddu.

859
00:57:58,458 --> 00:58:01,208
Babita kissed me.

860
00:58:02,250 --> 00:58:07,625
Your mother never kissed your father.
Why would Babita kiss you?

861
00:58:08,166 --> 00:58:09,333
I swear!

862
00:58:09,625 --> 00:58:14,208
She kissed me passionately.
The kiss lasted three seconds.

863
00:58:17,416 --> 00:58:19,250
0 people of the world!

864
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:23,000
You have never respected me.

865
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,458
“Look, there goes the dwarf,
here comes the dwarf.“

866
00:58:26,458 --> 00:58:29,791
Today Babita Kumari kissed the dwarf.

867
00:58:31,333 --> 00:58:33,333
I'm going to sing a song.

868
00:58:33,708 --> 00:58:36,958
- I'm going to sing a song.
- God forgive us.

869
00:58:37,166 --> 00:58:39,666
Don't say such crazy things,
Your Majesty.

870
00:58:39,666 --> 00:58:41,000
You're marrying tomorrow.

871
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,375
Maybe it's given you
a brain haemorrhage.

872
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:45,958
It happens before a wedding.
Let's go.

873
00:58:48,166 --> 00:58:50,041
Let me sing first.

874
00:58:50,291 --> 00:58:54,958
We're on our way.
The boy looks nice in his photo.

875
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:58,958
He has cute dimples.
What does he do?

876
00:58:59,166 --> 00:59:02,416
His father owns a big business.

877
00:59:02,583 --> 00:59:03,916
<i>But, Papa...</i>

878
00:59:04,416 --> 00:59:06,875
...he's a little short.

879
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:09,541
So what?

880
00:59:09,541 --> 00:59:11,583
<i>Your granddad was only 5 '6".</i>

881
00:59:11,583 --> 00:59:13,083
But what a gem.

882
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:18,500
- Is he tall enough to reach you?
- Yes, he does.

883
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:21,833
<i>Come, my beloved,
let us meet in the moonlight</i>

884
00:59:21,833 --> 00:59:27,250
<i>SeebgyouMewldemesswllum</i>

885
00:59:29,666 --> 00:59:33,958
<i>In this rain-soaked night...</i>

886
00:59:39,416 --> 00:59:41,708
"I'll walk this road." My foot.

887
00:59:48,125 --> 00:59:49,750
Guddu, I don't want to get married.

888
00:59:50,958 --> 00:59:52,125
I'm not ready.

889
01:00:05,291 --> 01:00:06,541
Enough, Ashok!

890
01:00:08,666 --> 01:00:09,666
Is this a joke?

891
01:00:09,666 --> 01:00:12,000
You said he was short,
but this short?

892
01:00:12,291 --> 01:00:14,208
You call this short?

893
01:00:14,958 --> 01:00:18,250
Pritpal, do you call this "short?"

894
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:21,291
- He's a dwarf.
- A dwarf!

895
01:00:22,125 --> 01:00:25,375
You're a top scientist
and you want to marry him?

896
01:00:25,375 --> 01:00:26,625
A dwarf?

897
01:00:26,625 --> 01:00:29,958
I'm hardly a Cinderella, Papa.

898
01:00:29,958 --> 01:00:33,416
What can I do if I'm in love
with a dwarf?

899
01:00:33,416 --> 01:00:36,833
You've fallen for a school dropout?

900
01:00:37,166 --> 01:00:41,125
Should I have checked
his school certificate first?

901
01:00:42,208 --> 01:00:45,375
I don't have to send him
to Mars, Mummy.

902
01:00:50,708 --> 01:00:51,666
Papa.

903
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:58,291
This is the first time
I've met someone...

904
01:00:58,541 --> 01:01:02,750
...who sees me, not my wheelchair.

905
01:01:03,458 --> 01:01:06,833
He talks to me like a human being.

906
01:01:07,666 --> 01:01:09,791
He doesn't think:

907
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:13,958
"How does one talk
to a disabled girl?“

908
01:01:13,958 --> 01:01:18,041
He treats me like a normal girl.

909
01:01:18,958 --> 01:01:22,916
- He doesn't pity me, Papa.
- Pity!

910
01:01:23,458 --> 01:01:25,000
A dwarf pitying you?

911
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:29,541
Enough! Are you marrying him?
Or am I?

912
01:01:32,083 --> 01:01:33,083
Papa.

913
01:01:36,208 --> 01:01:42,583
OK. Now I want to see everyone
having a good time here.

914
01:01:42,791 --> 01:01:44,291
- DJ!
- Yes ma'am.

915
01:01:44,541 --> 01:01:46,333
Let's have a Pashto song.

916
01:01:46,625 --> 01:01:48,750
What's Pashto?

917
01:01:50,375 --> 01:01:55,625
- Then play an English song.
- Don't have any English songs.

918
01:01:57,125 --> 01:02:00,708
Play a song in any language.

919
01:02:00,916 --> 01:02:02,916
An Afghani song then?

920
01:02:02,916 --> 01:02:04,125
Go on, play!

921
01:02:06,333 --> 01:02:08,875
Oh Papa, remember this song?

922
01:02:09,208 --> 01:02:10,541
Duffer!

923
01:02:15,708 --> 01:02:18,875
Let me ward off the evil eye...

924
01:02:18,875 --> 01:02:21,416
- ...or you might die.
- Get lost.

925
01:02:21,916 --> 01:02:24,291
Your family duped you.

926
01:02:24,291 --> 01:02:26,208
The post office played a trick too.

927
01:02:26,208 --> 01:02:27,166
What's this?

928
01:02:27,708 --> 01:02:30,958
Remember you enrolled for the Babita
dance contest? You're in.

929
01:02:35,541 --> 01:02:36,291
What...

930
01:02:39,083 --> 01:02:40,083
Now dance.

931
01:02:54,375 --> 01:02:59,291
<i>I'll say a prayer in your name...</i>

932
01:02:59,541 --> 01:03:01,916
<i>Be it day or night...</i>

933
01:03:14,458 --> 01:03:18,791
- It's nice and cool outside.
- Bauua, come inside.

934
01:03:18,791 --> 01:03:20,250
- Bauua.
- What?

935
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:21,833
- Congratulations!
- Fine. Fine.

936
01:03:22,666 --> 01:03:25,958
These notes aren't fake.
Give them to me later.

937
01:03:25,958 --> 01:03:29,208
I think you should
take him to America.

938
01:03:29,416 --> 01:03:33,500
- What's up?
- I...Uncle?

939
01:03:34,291 --> 01:03:37,375
Go on. You can talk to uncle.

940
01:03:39,333 --> 01:03:41,833
Uncle, where's the toilet?

941
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:45,375
Do it anywhere.

942
01:03:45,583 --> 01:03:47,541
Go ahead.

943
01:03:47,875 --> 01:03:49,125
He pees in small amounts.

944
01:03:50,208 --> 01:03:53,125
Take him to the US.
Charge people to see him.

945
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:04,583
Come this side.

946
01:04:04,583 --> 01:04:05,708
Come on.

947
01:04:05,708 --> 01:04:08,250
Come on. What are you doing?

948
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:09,916
[indistinct chatter]

949
01:04:15,791 --> 01:04:17,083
Come on.

950
01:04:23,625 --> 01:04:25,416
Hello! Hello!

951
01:04:26,166 --> 01:04:27,250
Aunty!

952
01:04:27,666 --> 01:04:28,625
Aunty!

953
01:04:28,625 --> 01:04:31,166
- How are you related?
- Her aunt.

954
01:04:31,166 --> 01:04:32,458
Okay, you stay.

955
01:04:33,041 --> 01:04:35,375
- And you?
- Her father's brother's...

956
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:40,541
Out. Anyone who doesn't know
how they're related must go.

957
01:04:40,541 --> 01:04:43,916
"Her father's so-and-so..."
etc won't do. All out!

958
01:04:43,916 --> 01:04:46,416
Kids, go outside.

959
01:04:46,416 --> 01:04:48,833
What are you doing, Bauua?

960
01:04:57,416 --> 01:05:00,375
What I'm about to say,
and what you're about to hear...

961
01:05:00,833 --> 01:05:02,500
...only your close relatives...

962
01:05:03,375 --> 01:05:05,541
...will be of help to you.

963
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:13,000
In romance there comes 10 seconds
when a man says: "Let's marry."

964
01:05:13,625 --> 01:05:16,708
You and my father didn't give me
those 10 seconds.

965
01:05:17,208 --> 01:05:20,291
You visited our house.
2 days later it's done.

966
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:24,000
The sangeet in 3 days.
All Meerut at my wedding in 4.

967
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,458
Now I stand before you,
a bridegroom.

968
01:05:32,833 --> 01:05:35,541
Are you proposing now?

969
01:05:35,541 --> 01:05:39,166
Proposing? I'm talking
about opposing, Aafia.

970
01:05:40,291 --> 01:05:44,333
I'm like the cuckoo.

971
01:05:44,916 --> 01:05:46,541
I can't build my own nest.

972
01:05:46,916 --> 01:05:49,375
I lay eggs in the
nests of other birds.

973
01:05:49,875 --> 01:05:53,166
All this, this wedding...

974
01:05:54,041 --> 01:05:55,541
My hands are tied.

975
01:05:55,958 --> 01:05:57,208
I really can't.

976
01:05:57,666 --> 01:06:01,208
You're an American.
Why did you agree to marry me?

977
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:04,916
I took you for a modern girl.
You drink and all.

978
01:06:05,083 --> 01:06:06,083
But...

979
01:06:06,958 --> 01:06:09,708
How come you suddenly became
the traditional wife?

980
01:06:10,416 --> 01:06:13,750
You'll look odd fasting for the
health of your husband.

981
01:06:17,416 --> 01:06:18,458
Come here.

982
01:06:26,666 --> 01:06:29,666
How old are you, Bauua?

983
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,250
38!

984
01:06:32,875 --> 01:06:35,333
- Meaning?
- 39.

985
01:06:37,541 --> 01:06:42,041
In all these 38 years...

986
01:06:42,833 --> 01:06:47,458
...have you found anyone besides me...

987
01:06:48,333 --> 01:06:53,875
...whom you could look in the eye
and talk to?

988
01:06:56,291 --> 01:06:59,666
Everyone towers over you.

989
01:07:01,375 --> 01:07:04,916
How long will you crane your neck?

990
01:07:05,208 --> 01:07:09,916
When you can look at me
straight in the eye. And me you.

991
01:07:10,833 --> 01:07:14,291
We're made for each other.

992
01:07:15,083 --> 01:07:19,458
Why be a cuckoo at your age, Bauua?

993
01:07:21,458 --> 01:07:24,000
Build your own nest.

994
01:07:25,958 --> 01:07:28,375
Don't, Aafia. Don't.

995
01:07:28,583 --> 01:07:30,375
My heart can hear you.

996
01:07:31,291 --> 01:07:33,583
But my heart does not hear you.

997
01:07:38,291 --> 01:07:41,625
Control both your hearts.

998
01:07:41,958 --> 01:07:45,708
Have a drink if you need to.

999
01:07:46,708 --> 01:07:51,958
Go and sit in the groom's chair.

1000
01:07:52,291 --> 01:07:53,458
Don't be scared.

1001
01:07:53,458 --> 01:07:58,083
The operation will be over
before you know it.

1002
01:07:59,750 --> 01:08:03,166
But if there's something else,
tell me.

1003
01:08:15,375 --> 01:08:16,583
What is this?

1004
01:08:17,291 --> 01:08:19,708
I've been selected
for a dance contest.

1005
01:08:20,666 --> 01:08:23,125
The winner meets Babita Kumari.

1006
01:08:25,541 --> 01:08:26,583
So?

1007
01:08:28,041 --> 01:08:31,708
You've hardly been selected
to an Ivy League college.

1008
01:08:38,791 --> 01:08:41,416
Babita Kumari kissed me yesterday.

1009
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,625
Look at your height, Bauua.

1010
01:09:02,458 --> 01:09:05,166
If Babita kissed you...

1011
01:09:05,166 --> 01:09:08,875
...then I'm carrying
Leonardo DiCaprio's child.

1012
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:15,708
You've ruined my make-up.
Go!

1013
01:09:17,375 --> 01:09:18,250
You know...

1014
01:09:19,750 --> 01:09:21,958
I was born a cuckoo...

1015
01:09:23,250 --> 01:09:24,500
...I'll die as one.

1016
01:09:29,916 --> 01:09:31,708
Don't be sad.

1017
01:09:33,333 --> 01:09:34,625
I'll run away.

1018
01:09:35,916 --> 01:09:37,041
I'll run away.

1019
01:09:37,875 --> 01:09:40,375
I'll run away.

1020
01:09:40,708 --> 01:09:42,625
"I'll run away." As if!

1021
01:09:43,333 --> 01:09:46,208
Go, wait outside.

1022
01:09:46,541 --> 01:09:48,208
Go, wait outside.

1023
01:10:23,083 --> 01:10:26,041
Small chap, sit down!

1024
01:10:27,458 --> 01:10:28,583
No, brother.

1025
01:10:29,875 --> 01:10:32,708
I'm not staying. No.

1026
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:36,458
- Shall I show you a magic trick?
- What trick?

1027
01:10:36,458 --> 01:10:38,041
- Can you count?
- Yes.

1028
01:10:38,041 --> 01:10:39,833
- So count...one
- One...

1029
01:10:43,708 --> 01:10:45,916
- Two...
- Two...

1030
01:10:48,250 --> 01:10:50,416
- Three. ..
- Three...

1031
01:10:53,083 --> 01:10:54,500
Where are you going?

1032
01:11:13,708 --> 01:11:14,958
Stop!

1033
01:11:21,291 --> 01:11:24,041
Damn you, people of Meerut!

1034
01:11:24,666 --> 01:11:25,583
Get lost.

1035
01:11:25,916 --> 01:11:26,833
Stop!

1036
01:11:28,125 --> 01:11:29,166
He is gone.

1037
01:11:35,333 --> 01:11:36,833
Where to, mister?

1038
01:11:51,166 --> 01:11:54,708
<i>...you'll belong to me</i>

1039
01:12:01,375 --> 01:12:03,708
<i>A man is basically 4'6".</i>

1040
01:12:04,416 --> 01:12:06,916
<i>Anything above that is arrogance.</i>

1041
01:12:07,416 --> 01:12:10,291
<i>Babita made me arrogant by kissing me.</i>

1042
01:12:10,958 --> 01:12:12,791
<i>Now I'm a six-footer.</i>

1043
01:12:13,125 --> 01:12:16,583
<i>I've left behind my family,
friends and Aafia.</i>

1044
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,625
<i>But Bauua Singh would
never leave behind his courage.</i>

1045
01:12:22,041 --> 01:12:25,250
<i>Bauua Singh has won
five dance rounds...</i>

1046
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:28,916
<i>...by defeating his rivals
and winning their hearts.</i>

1047
01:12:29,291 --> 01:12:32,416
<i>He's through the semi-finals...</i>

1048
01:12:32,416 --> 01:12:37,208
<i>...and now Bauua Singh comes
for the grand finale of the show.</i>

1049
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:43,291
<i>He will now have to dance
against two contestants.</i>

1050
01:12:50,083 --> 01:12:52,416
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

1051
01:12:52,708 --> 01:12:56,458
<i>...please welcome Ganesh Acharya...</i>

1052
01:12:57,333 --> 01:13:00,833
<i>...and Remo D'Souza.</i>

1053
01:13:01,416 --> 01:13:06,250
<i>Whether Bauua Singh wins
or loses will be decided by...</i>

1054
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,958
<i>myfriends. I present to you...</i>

1055
01:13:10,250 --> 01:13:13,333
<i>...the glory of “Dabangg,”
the life of "Tiger"...</i>

1056
01:13:13,333 --> 01:13:16,083
<i>...Salman Khan!</i>

1057
01:13:17,458 --> 01:13:27,250
<i>Towers over all others.</i>

1058
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:42,625
<i>I drank the nectar of love...</i>

1059
01:13:42,958 --> 01:13:46,041
<i>...and lost all sense of reason</i>

1060
01:13:46,041 --> 01:13:49,291
<i>I am the great lover...</i>

1061
01:13:49,541 --> 01:13:52,541
<i>...let no one come in my way</i>

1062
01:13:52,708 --> 01:13:59,041
<i>The look in her eyes
makes my head spin</i>

1063
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:02,500
<i>Since she became mine...</i>

1064
01:14:02,791 --> 01:14:06,166
<i>...the world seems full of lovers</i>

1065
01:14:06,458 --> 01:14:08,125
<i>I swear</i>

1066
01:14:08,125 --> 01:14:09,500
<i>By God</i>

1067
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:16,083
<i>My heart has been taken over by love</i>

1068
01:14:16,333 --> 01:14:22,791
<i>My heart has been taken over by love</i>

1069
01:14:50,416 --> 01:14:52,458
<i>How would you know...</i>

1070
01:14:52,458 --> 01:14:56,791
<i>...where the bird of love
flies in the sky?</i>

1071
01:14:56,791 --> 01:15:00,416
<i>My love is like a shadow...</i>

1072
01:15:00,708 --> 01:15:03,166
<i>...falling wherever it pleases</i>

1073
01:15:03,416 --> 01:15:09,916
<i>Love pierces your heart
with the sharpest dagger</i>

1074
01:15:09,916 --> 01:15:12,333
<i>When the pain increases...</i>

1075
01:15:12,333 --> 01:15:16,625
<i>...then living life
is more pleasurable</i>

1076
01:15:16,625 --> 01:15:20,625
<i>Our meeting is so unique</i>

1077
01:15:23,916 --> 01:15:26,583
<i>Our meeting is so unique</i>

1078
01:15:27,250 --> 01:15:29,958
<i>He's a wave, I am water</i>

1079
01:15:30,583 --> 01:15:36,791
<i>You are the river. I am the shore.
The waves roll my way</i>

1080
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:44,083
<i>My heart has been taken over by love</i>

1081
01:15:58,291 --> 01:16:00,166
<i>I love her deeply</i>

1082
01:16:01,541 --> 01:16:04,083
<i>She loves me deeply</i>

1083
01:16:04,875 --> 01:16:07,875
<i>I can't live without her</i>

1084
01:16:08,166 --> 01:16:11,041
<i>She's incomplete without me</i>

1085
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:14,708
<i>I'll make her turn away from you</i>

1086
01:16:14,708 --> 01:16:17,958
<i>You may be her yes-man,
but she won't listen to you</i>

1087
01:16:17,958 --> 01:16:21,291
<i>She has so many admirers,
how could she care for you?</i>

1088
01:16:21,291 --> 01:16:24,583
<i>You're not tall enough
to have big dreams</i>

1089
01:16:24,583 --> 01:16:28,041
<i>You've become too big
for your boots</i>

1090
01:16:28,041 --> 01:16:31,333
<i>You're a crazy Indian,
she's a foreign fairy</i>

1091
01:16:31,333 --> 01:16:34,666
<i>For me only love counts...</i>

1092
01:16:34,666 --> 01:16:37,666
<i>...that's why I'm an Indian lad,
and she's a foreign lass</i>

1093
01:16:37,666 --> 01:16:41,041
<i>You've won my heart
with your words</i>

1094
01:16:41,250 --> 01:16:44,333
<i>Let's be friends,
let's shake hands</i>

1095
01:16:44,583 --> 01:16:47,666
<i>Let's be friends,</i>

1096
01:16:48,583 --> 01:16:52,500
<i>Let's shake hands</i>

1097
01:17:00,208 --> 01:17:04,000
Once more! Once more...!

1098
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,916
Once more! Once more...!

1099
01:17:38,916 --> 01:17:40,083
Aafia!

1100
01:17:42,333 --> 01:17:43,583
Babita!

1101
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,791
Babita!

1102
01:17:53,166 --> 01:17:54,333
OK, listen, I'm here.

1103
01:17:54,666 --> 01:17:57,375
Call you later. Bye.

1104
01:18:01,458 --> 01:18:02,666
Mind your strap, babe!

1105
01:18:02,958 --> 01:18:06,958
Sweetheart, that's why
they come to see me.

1106
01:18:06,958 --> 01:18:10,708
Babita Kumari can't control herself.
Or her clothes.

1107
01:18:10,708 --> 01:18:13,666
"Wardrobe malfunction
at her own party!"

1108
01:18:16,333 --> 01:18:17,833
Let them enjoy!

1109
01:18:50,916 --> 01:18:53,166
"Your eyes are full of pain."

1110
01:18:53,625 --> 01:18:54,541
Excuse me?

1111
01:18:54,541 --> 01:18:56,250
Did he say that to you?

1112
01:18:57,541 --> 01:18:59,416
"I have a complaint.

1113
01:18:59,958 --> 01:19:02,375
"Why haven't we met before?"

1114
01:19:03,666 --> 01:19:05,083
Did he tell you?

1115
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,208
Tell me.

1116
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:16,541
Did he ask you to sit on his lap?

1117
01:19:16,708 --> 01:19:19,958
- What are you doing, babes?
- Let go!

1118
01:19:19,958 --> 01:19:20,833
Stop it.

1119
01:19:20,833 --> 01:19:24,375
Vinod, get me a drink.

1120
01:19:24,708 --> 01:19:25,791
Let's go.

1121
01:19:30,791 --> 01:19:33,083
One fine day he just got bald.

1122
01:19:33,083 --> 01:19:35,125
But he looks so funny bald!

1123
01:19:36,083 --> 01:19:38,291
- Hi, ma'am.
- How are you?

1124
01:19:38,291 --> 01:19:41,333
"Four lamps always
burning at your alter."

1125
01:19:41,750 --> 01:19:43,416
"And I am the fifth..."

1126
01:19:43,958 --> 01:19:46,208
Hurry, Bauua.
Madam is on her way.

1127
01:19:46,208 --> 01:19:48,750
- What is this?
- Hurry up.

1128
01:19:50,125 --> 01:19:52,625
- Keep moving.
- Let me finish eating.

1129
01:19:53,666 --> 01:19:54,791
There she is.

1130
01:19:54,958 --> 01:19:56,958
Bring her here.

1131
01:19:57,291 --> 01:20:00,458
Another tacky party.

1132
01:20:01,916 --> 01:20:03,458
You are drinking.

1133
01:20:04,125 --> 01:20:05,708
You must meet him.

1134
01:20:05,916 --> 01:20:09,833
- What is it? Who must I meet?
- The winner of the dance contest.

1135
01:20:19,208 --> 01:20:20,708
Don't worry.

1136
01:20:21,166 --> 01:20:22,708
You look fine.

1137
01:20:23,083 --> 01:20:25,250
Hi. Babita Kumari.

1138
01:20:25,875 --> 01:20:28,083
Bauua Singh from Meerut,
Uttar Pradesh.

1139
01:20:29,208 --> 01:20:32,125
Have we met before?
You look familiar.

1140
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,916
I've known you for 15 years.

1141
01:20:35,083 --> 01:20:37,916
Yes, <i>we've</i> met. In Meerut.

1142
01:20:38,333 --> 01:20:39,916
Don't remember.

1143
01:20:40,916 --> 01:20:44,250
Congratulations on winning
the dance competition.

1144
01:20:44,458 --> 01:20:45,958
Keep watching my films.

1145
01:20:47,583 --> 01:20:52,000
[background music]

1146
01:20:54,875 --> 01:20:56,958
Was I drunk in Meerut?

1147
01:20:58,833 --> 01:21:00,250
Not that drunk.

1148
01:21:02,166 --> 01:21:03,958
Did I kiss you?

1149
01:21:05,833 --> 01:21:09,041
No way! Meerut guys aren't that lucky.

1150
01:21:09,958 --> 01:21:11,833
I do crazy things when I'm drunk.

1151
01:21:19,583 --> 01:21:20,583
Good.

1152
01:21:21,375 --> 01:21:22,541
It's all good.

1153
01:21:22,833 --> 01:21:24,541
Ladies and gentlemen!

1154
01:21:24,708 --> 01:21:26,916
You're all such important people.

1155
01:21:27,083 --> 01:21:30,666
You have travelled the world
and seen so much.

1156
01:21:30,666 --> 01:21:32,625
But it's the first time you'll see...

1157
01:21:32,791 --> 01:21:36,750
...a dwarf plucking stars
from the sky.

1158
01:21:38,250 --> 01:21:40,791
This <i>boy's</i> not on my team.

1159
01:21:40,958 --> 01:21:43,791
If he messes up, don't cut my share.

1160
01:21:43,791 --> 01:21:45,875
- Ijustplaythermsic.

1161
01:21:46,125 --> 01:21:48,333
OK. Start!

1162
01:21:55,625 --> 01:21:57,750
Come, madam,
let me show you magic.

1163
01:21:58,083 --> 01:22:01,291
Ladies, gather round.
The show is for you.

1164
01:22:04,250 --> 01:22:05,458
Come, ladies.

1165
01:22:05,750 --> 01:22:09,166
I've always encouraged new talent.

1166
01:22:09,833 --> 01:22:11,708
Show us your star-plucking.

1167
01:22:12,666 --> 01:22:14,125
You recognise talent.

1168
01:22:14,125 --> 01:22:16,375
Talent knows talent.

1169
01:22:16,375 --> 01:22:18,125
I'll show you some magic.

1170
01:22:18,416 --> 01:22:21,041
Let's see your magic.

1171
01:22:21,541 --> 01:22:22,708
Kajol! Hi!

1172
01:22:22,708 --> 01:22:24,625
Wait for us.

1173
01:22:24,833 --> 01:22:27,333
Hey you...

1174
01:22:28,791 --> 01:22:32,291
Srideviji, you look wonderful.

1175
01:22:32,291 --> 01:22:35,625
Some guy here is promising
to pluck stars like you!

1176
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:37,291


1177
01:22:38,875 --> 01:22:40,875
You're a newly-wed.

1178
01:22:40,875 --> 01:22:43,208
My gift to you.
Watch the stars fall.

1179
01:22:43,375 --> 01:22:44,083
Ready.

1180
01:22:44,291 --> 01:22:45,208
Do you think he can do it?

1181
01:22:45,208 --> 01:22:47,916
Long live the Goddess!

1182
01:22:49,583 --> 01:22:52,333
Ten...nine...eight..zero.

1183
01:22:58,375 --> 01:23:00,958
Ten...nine...eight..zero.

1184
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:06,083
Ten...nine...eight..zero.

1185
01:23:10,291 --> 01:23:13,000
Ten...nine...eight..zero.

1186
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:15,416
Come on! What's going on?

1187
01:23:15,916 --> 01:23:19,166
Ten...nine...eight..zero.

1188
01:23:20,541 --> 01:23:21,708
Its happening.

1189
01:23:21,916 --> 01:23:23,375
It takes time.

1190
01:23:23,875 --> 01:23:25,625
Take your time.

1191
01:23:27,041 --> 01:23:30,208
Ten...nine...eight..zero.

1192
01:23:30,875 --> 01:23:33,125
Ten...nine...eight..zero.

1193
01:23:33,958 --> 01:23:35,125
Come on!

1194
01:23:39,916 --> 01:23:45,250
- This is a new city, that's why.
- Maybe they've fallen in Meerut.

1195
01:23:45,250 --> 01:23:47,416
Forget Meerut.
I can do it here.

1196
01:23:47,416 --> 01:23:50,833
Just watch.
Ten...nine...eight...zero.

1197
01:23:51,625 --> 01:23:53,666
Ten...nine...eight..zero.

1198
01:23:54,166 --> 01:23:56,166
Ten...nine...eight..zero.

1199
01:23:56,166 --> 01:23:57,208
Let it be.

1200
01:23:57,500 --> 01:23:59,333
You're not that talented.

1201
01:24:00,166 --> 01:24:03,000
Madam, give me another minute.

1202
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,083
- Maybe next time.
- Please wait.

1203
01:24:05,750 --> 01:24:09,041
You haven't take a selfie.
Take one.

1204
01:24:10,041 --> 01:24:11,666
- What's 'oul, out“?

1205
01:24:12,041 --> 01:24:13,333
Why are you laughing?

1206
01:24:13,333 --> 01:24:14,625
It's fine. Next time.

1207
01:24:14,625 --> 01:24:16,125
I'm going tomorrow.

1208
01:24:17,250 --> 01:24:19,000
- The moon.
- The moon?

1209
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,416
- Tried the moon?
- Only the stars...

1210
01:24:22,416 --> 01:24:24,125
Your wedding is over.

1211
01:24:25,416 --> 01:24:26,458
But...

1212
01:24:27,250 --> 01:24:29,708
Ten...nine...eight...

1213
01:24:34,541 --> 01:24:35,625
What's wrong?

1214
01:24:37,125 --> 01:24:40,125
First time you've been humiliated
in public?

1215
01:24:40,541 --> 01:24:42,625
Is that why you're sad?

1216
01:24:45,708 --> 01:24:48,625
Bauua Singh from Meerut, U.P.

1217
01:24:49,208 --> 01:24:51,500
The stars used to listen to me,
Babita.

1218
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:53,875
I don't know what's wrong.

1219
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,541
Of course they listen.

1220
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,708
Whose heart did you break, Shorty?

1221
01:25:02,791 --> 01:25:05,750
Yours or hers...

1222
01:25:06,166 --> 01:25:08,208
...or all the hearts in Meerut?

1223
01:25:10,875 --> 01:25:12,125
Correct?

1224
01:25:12,125 --> 01:25:14,583
They're only stars, Shorty.

1225
01:25:14,875 --> 01:25:19,208
That naughty used to say if I just
looked at him...

1226
01:25:19,625 --> 01:25:21,916
...the ground would slip away.

1227
01:25:23,333 --> 01:25:24,333
Rubbish!

1228
01:25:25,166 --> 01:25:28,125
I can't even put down
this wine glass.

1229
01:25:28,375 --> 01:25:32,250
It's been two months and it's
still glued to my hand.

1230
01:25:33,666 --> 01:25:40,541
Shorty, when a heart breaks
even a wretched dog doesn't hear it.

1231
01:25:41,625 --> 01:25:44,083
At least your stars have dignity.

1232
01:25:46,041 --> 01:25:46,875
Wow!

1233
01:25:47,166 --> 01:25:48,750
Now that's a good line!

1234
01:25:48,750 --> 01:25:51,000
Shall I walk you out?

1235
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:54,250
Is someone like you going
to walk out on me too?

1236
01:25:54,250 --> 01:25:56,500
I've left the world for you.

1237
01:25:56,666 --> 01:25:59,833
Just say the word.
I'll stay glued to you forever.

1238
01:26:00,666 --> 01:26:02,750
Say something new.

1239
01:26:02,750 --> 01:26:05,458
That's a line from my old film.

1240
01:26:05,916 --> 01:26:07,291
You're broken hearted.

1241
01:26:07,291 --> 01:26:10,041
Keep me by your side,
I'll amuse you.

1242
01:26:10,041 --> 01:26:12,708
I'll make you laugh at
least 25 times a day. Promise.

1243
01:26:13,416 --> 01:26:15,625
Laughing isn't all I want.
It's not important.

1244
01:26:15,625 --> 01:26:16,416
Then, I will not laugh.

1245
01:26:16,416 --> 01:26:20,125
I can advise you on what to wear;
the matching lipstick.

1246
01:26:20,125 --> 01:26:23,791
I already pay ten people to do that.

1247
01:26:23,791 --> 01:26:27,541
If you're that smart,
why is your heart broken so often?

1248
01:26:27,541 --> 01:26:31,083
Babita, you understand
the world but not people.

1249
01:26:31,083 --> 01:26:32,291
And you do?

1250
01:26:32,291 --> 01:26:36,750
I can tell the annual budget just
by looking at the Finance Minister!

1251
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:39,291
My specialty!

1252
01:26:39,750 --> 01:26:42,041
That's useful.

1253
01:26:42,791 --> 01:26:46,708
Let me decide if I want you
glued to me.

1254
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:51,708
Come to the shoot tomorrow.

1255
01:26:55,375 --> 01:26:58,291
- And this director?
- An idiot.

1256
01:26:59,666 --> 01:27:02,750
- That one?
- Shrewd, a sharpie.

1257
01:27:04,708 --> 01:27:05,583
Hi!

1258
01:27:09,625 --> 01:27:11,958
Is she a friend or foe?

1259
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:14,916
Neither.

1260
01:27:15,166 --> 01:27:18,208
She couldn't care less
if you lived or died.

1261
01:27:19,875 --> 01:27:22,500
<i>The gangsters are circling
the heroine.</i>

1262
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:24,291
<i>And him?</i>

1263
01:27:24,291 --> 01:27:27,458
<i>Why does he take my breath away?</i>

1264
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:31,500
<i>Because he's a pillow girls love
smothering their faces in.</i>

1265
01:27:31,708 --> 01:27:36,083
<i>He pretends to be a poet.
Misunderstood by the world.</i>

1266
01:27:36,375 --> 01:27:38,333
<i>- But he's a mother...!
- Enough.</i>

1267
01:27:39,291 --> 01:27:40,041
Listen.

1268
01:27:45,791 --> 01:27:47,125
Ma'am, shot's ready.

1269
01:27:48,833 --> 01:27:49,833
The shot's ready.

1270
01:27:50,916 --> 01:27:53,291
Not ready, son. It's a wrap.

1271
01:27:53,750 --> 01:27:54,541
Let's go.

1272
01:27:55,833 --> 01:27:57,458
It's a wrap!

1273
01:27:58,125 --> 01:28:00,458
Bauua, want a drink?

1274
01:28:01,625 --> 01:28:04,083
What's today? Wednesday?

1275
01:28:04,250 --> 01:28:05,875
OK, I'll drink.

1276
01:28:06,375 --> 01:28:08,583
Come. Close the door.

1277
01:28:08,583 --> 01:28:12,416
I'm plain unlucky.
Falling in love with a mother...l

1278
01:28:12,416 --> 01:28:14,750
Enough! Let's throw up together.

1279
01:28:14,916 --> 01:28:16,583
It's coming.

1280
01:28:16,791 --> 01:28:19,833
There comes the corn!

1281
01:28:20,250 --> 01:28:25,000
In Uttar Pradesh,
people think you're an angel.

1282
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:28,000
That you sprout wings
behind closed doors.

1283
01:28:28,250 --> 01:28:32,083
Your name may not matter to you here,
but keep your honour in my town.

1284
01:28:32,291 --> 01:28:34,875
Get over that man.

1285
01:28:35,375 --> 01:28:37,500
He's a cheap guava...

1286
01:28:38,250 --> 01:28:41,458
...and you're a pricey Kashmiri apple.

1287
01:28:41,458 --> 01:28:42,625
I mean it.

1288
01:28:46,708 --> 01:28:47,916
You're right.

1289
01:28:49,083 --> 01:28:50,500
A pricey...

1290
01:28:51,791 --> 01:28:54,000
...Kashmiri apple.

1291
01:28:54,333 --> 01:28:55,708
With Wings!

1292
01:28:55,916 --> 01:28:57,041
Come on.

1293
01:29:00,375 --> 01:29:01,291
Action!

1294
01:29:02,375 --> 01:29:04,083
<i>Do you have a large family?</i>

1295
01:29:04,541 --> 01:29:06,833
<i>All Meerut belongs to me!</i>

1296
01:29:08,541 --> 01:29:12,666
<i>At home there's Ma, Papa,
my younger brother, his wife and...</i>

1297
01:29:12,666 --> 01:29:15,750
<i>- AndAafla.</i>

1298
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:17,666
<i>Aafia? Who's Aafia?</i>

1299
01:29:18,708 --> 01:29:20,583
<i>This fantastic girl.</i>

1300
01:29:21,125 --> 01:29:24,125
<i>Good thing the Goddess
put her in a wheelchair...</i>

1301
01:29:24,125 --> 01:29:26,541
<i>...or she'd be flying in the air.</i>

1302
01:29:26,958 --> 01:29:29,708
<i>She's as honest as I'm dishonest.</i>

1303
01:29:30,583 --> 01:29:34,000
<i>She was the only one, apart from
my mother, who loved me.</i>

1304
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:38,541
<i>I ran away, leaving her in tears.</i>

1305
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,500
Why? Did a mad dog bite you?

1306
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:44,833
Not a dog.
My dishonesty bit me.

1307
01:29:45,750 --> 01:29:49,375
Then one night India's queen
kissed me.

1308
01:29:49,375 --> 01:29:51,458
Want a slap? Move your foot!

1309
01:29:53,125 --> 01:29:55,250
You've got long legs...please.

1310
01:29:59,166 --> 01:30:00,666
<i>So you forgot Aafia?</i>

1311
01:30:01,250 --> 01:30:04,208
<i>Don't you miss her?
Why are you here?</i>

1312
01:30:05,125 --> 01:30:06,166
Because of you.

1313
01:30:06,750 --> 01:30:08,500
<i>I do miss her...</i>

1314
01:30:08,791 --> 01:30:12,500
<i>...but I scold myself and say,
"I don't miss her."</i>

1315
01:30:12,500 --> 01:30:15,833
<i>How long will you keep
scolding yourself?</i>

1316
01:30:17,625 --> 01:30:19,833
Do you know why I've kept you?

1317
01:30:22,125 --> 01:30:24,333
Because I'm so cute.
All the girls fall for me.

1318
01:30:24,625 --> 01:30:26,250
They love my dimples.

1319
01:30:27,666 --> 01:30:28,208
Cute!

1320
01:30:28,208 --> 01:30:30,291
- Think I don't know that?
- So, why?

1321
01:30:30,666 --> 01:30:32,416
Because my parents were dwarves.

1322
01:30:35,125 --> 01:30:36,125
Dwarves?

1323
01:30:37,750 --> 01:30:41,791
They looked fine in the Google photo.
You're kidding.

1324
01:30:41,791 --> 01:30:43,291
They aren't my real parents.

1325
01:30:44,166 --> 01:30:45,958
I met them outside a temple.

1326
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:48,208
My parents were dwarves.

1327
01:30:50,625 --> 01:30:53,166
They worked in a circus in Kolkata.

1328
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,416
My mother was bought
from a Russian circus.

1329
01:30:56,708 --> 01:30:59,375
And my father was a Punjabi.
Both dwarves.

1330
01:31:00,125 --> 01:31:01,208
Amazing.

1331
01:31:01,583 --> 01:31:05,041
Papa was a lion tamer,
Mummy a trapeze artist.

1332
01:31:06,125 --> 01:31:06,875
Then?

1333
01:31:06,875 --> 01:31:11,833
They fell deeply in love
with each other. They got married.

1334
01:31:12,791 --> 01:31:14,375
When my mother was pregnant...

1335
01:31:14,375 --> 01:31:16,875
...the circus-owner's daughter
fell in love with Papa.

1336
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,541
- Was she a dwarf?
- No, she was normal.

1337
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:27,125
She seduced Papa, so he dumped
my mother and they eloped.

1338
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,916
- Then?
- They say she took him to Belarus.

1339
01:31:35,208 --> 01:31:39,666
They were together for a while
then she dumped Papa.

1340
01:31:40,125 --> 01:31:41,208
I heard...

1341
01:31:41,208 --> 01:31:45,291
...she fell in love with a Prince
from Madagascar.

1342
01:31:45,875 --> 01:31:46,666
Then?

1343
01:31:46,666 --> 01:31:49,750
She sold father in an Egyptian market.

1344
01:31:50,125 --> 01:31:53,083
Good heavens. Then?

1345
01:31:53,333 --> 01:31:56,333
He worked in a circus in Egypt
for ten years.

1346
01:31:56,541 --> 01:31:59,000
Then he ran away to Yemen...

1347
01:31:59,333 --> 01:32:00,666
...and worked in an oil well.

1348
01:32:00,875 --> 01:32:02,375
People who knew him said...

1349
01:32:02,375 --> 01:32:05,250
...he loved my mother till the end.

1350
01:32:06,041 --> 01:32:09,791
When he died he had a smile
on his lips and my mother's name...

1351
01:32:10,166 --> 01:32:11,125
...AIina.

1352
01:32:11,416 --> 01:32:14,541
He loved her! Utter rubbish!

1353
01:32:14,541 --> 01:32:16,708
Why didn't he go back to your mother?

1354
01:32:17,625 --> 01:32:20,250
She was dead by then.

1355
01:32:26,916 --> 01:32:28,791
When did she die?

1356
01:32:29,333 --> 01:32:32,000
By the time he returned to
Kolkata, 20 years later...

1357
01:32:32,541 --> 01:32:34,083
...she was already dead.

1358
01:32:34,416 --> 01:32:38,875
Why didn't he go back to her sooner?
To Alina?

1359
01:32:38,875 --> 01:32:41,208
My mother had remarried by then.

1360
01:32:43,333 --> 01:32:45,083
To a dwarf?

1361
01:32:45,083 --> 01:32:46,708
No, he was normal.

1362
01:32:47,291 --> 01:32:49,125
Must they all marry normal people?

1363
01:32:51,458 --> 01:32:53,750
- When did she remarry?
- 6 years after Papa...

1364
01:32:53,958 --> 01:32:56,500
...had left, I guess.

1365
01:32:57,625 --> 01:33:00,291
Why didn't he return to Alina
in all those years?

1366
01:33:00,875 --> 01:33:04,000
If he loved her, surely
he would have gone back.

1367
01:33:04,458 --> 01:33:05,541
He should've.

1368
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:07,916
Why didn't he?

1369
01:33:09,041 --> 01:33:09,833
You tell me.

1370
01:33:10,708 --> 01:33:13,958
When people love each other
why don't they stay together?

1371
01:33:14,708 --> 01:33:15,750
Tell me.

1372
01:33:21,666 --> 01:33:23,958
Stop the car. I have to pee.

1373
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:26,083
I must pee.

1374
01:33:35,416 --> 01:33:38,500
Sorry, madam. But your mother lives
on 12th Road in Bandra.

1375
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:41,208
But he doesn't know that!

1376
01:33:41,791 --> 01:33:45,833
I was narrating the story
of my next film. How is it?

1377
01:33:45,833 --> 01:33:48,208
It's a horror, madam,
but very good.

1378
01:33:50,958 --> 01:33:53,291
Today we're filming
the most important scene.

1379
01:33:53,291 --> 01:33:57,416
She's made us wait two hours.
Bauua, persuade her to come.

1380
01:33:57,416 --> 01:33:59,916
I'll go and check.

1383
01:34:22,833 --> 01:34:24,041
OK, hon.

1384
01:34:26,125 --> 01:34:27,458
I'll call you this evening.

1385
01:34:30,125 --> 01:34:31,291
Hey, buddy.

1386
01:34:33,041 --> 01:34:37,416
He begged me to forgive him.
He said he'd never do it again.

1387
01:34:37,791 --> 01:34:40,791
He loves me.
Everyone makes mistake.

1388
01:34:41,583 --> 01:34:43,291
How does this work?

01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:04,041
Cut it!

1391
01:35:16,250 --> 01:35:17,291
Hello?

1392
01:36:07,291 --> 01:36:10,375
- Your girlfriend's robot isn't working.
- It's not a robot. It's a rover.

1393
01:36:10,750 --> 01:36:12,708
It's called Velocity.

1394
01:36:13,625 --> 01:36:17,041
It takes photographs and digs on Mars.

1395
01:36:17,041 --> 01:36:20,625
Sweetheart! You've become
a scientist like Abdul Kalam.

1396
01:36:22,666 --> 01:36:23,791
Aafia built it.

1397
01:36:23,791 --> 01:36:25,791
Either you're blind or I am.

1398
01:36:26,166 --> 01:36:30,958
You're in love with Aafia.
You just can't see it.

1399
01:36:31,333 --> 01:36:32,666
I see it clearly.

1400
01:36:33,041 --> 01:36:36,166
Wow! It's looking so nice.

1401
01:36:37,458 --> 01:36:39,208
If you know it,
why are you back here?

1402
01:36:39,208 --> 01:36:40,500
Your lover ran away too.

1403
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:42,625
Yes. But he came back.

1404
01:36:42,625 --> 01:36:45,500
He won't leave you again, will he?

1405
01:36:45,875 --> 01:36:48,458
Stay with him.

1406
01:36:49,125 --> 01:36:51,625
Let's see if your love story
becomes the stuff of legends.

1407
01:36:51,625 --> 01:36:54,250
You bolted. Some love story!

1408
01:36:57,041 --> 01:36:59,500
What has running or staying
got to do with love?

1409
01:36:59,833 --> 01:37:02,958
Even my lust is truer than
other people's love.

1410
01:37:02,958 --> 01:37:04,666
So you admit you love her?

1411
01:37:04,666 --> 01:37:06,166
Did I say I didn't?

1412
01:37:06,833 --> 01:37:09,333
In 38 years... 39...

1413
01:37:09,916 --> 01:37:13,125
...she was the only girl I could
look in the eye and talk to.

1414
01:37:14,375 --> 01:37:17,416
They all towered over me.
I had to crane my neck.

1415
01:37:17,750 --> 01:37:20,416
We could look each other
straight in the eye.

1416
01:37:20,916 --> 01:37:25,083
If I'd stayed, we would've
been a perfect match.

1417
01:37:26,458 --> 01:37:27,750
Those are her lines.

1418
01:37:29,125 --> 01:37:30,125
And yours?

1419
01:37:30,500 --> 01:37:32,916
My line? "I love you."

1420
01:37:33,500 --> 01:37:36,541
Forget it! Stop lying.

1421
01:37:36,541 --> 01:37:39,416
- Why don't you lie sometimes?
- You won't go back to her?

1422
01:37:40,875 --> 01:37:42,416
You won't let me, will you?

1423
01:37:46,166 --> 01:37:47,333
Go!

1424
01:37:48,541 --> 01:37:49,958
I'm not stopping you.

1425
01:37:50,708 --> 01:37:52,291
Send me back.

1426
01:37:53,791 --> 01:37:56,166
For <i>God's</i> sake. Push me away.

1427
01:37:57,291 --> 01:38:01,291
For the sake of your lover,
that dog Aditya Kapoor.

1428
01:38:05,875 --> 01:38:06,833
Please.

1429
01:38:33,458 --> 01:38:38,708
Happy birthday to you!

1430
01:38:39,041 --> 01:38:42,000
Happy birthday, dear Babita!

1431
01:38:52,166 --> 01:38:53,625
Let me through.

1432
01:38:57,583 --> 01:38:58,708
He's a cheat.

1433
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,833
I saw him kissing that girl.

1434
01:39:02,416 --> 01:39:04,458
What the hell!
He's lying, Babita.

1435
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:06,791
Me? Lying?

1436
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,875
Admit it! Weren't you kissing him
in the kitchen?

1437
01:39:10,791 --> 01:39:14,250
That was my boyfriend.
I wasn't kissing Aditya.

1438
01:39:14,958 --> 01:39:17,666
Same thing.
Everyone is kissing someone.

1439
01:39:17,875 --> 01:39:19,875
He kissed her, she kissed him.

1440
01:39:20,083 --> 01:39:22,125
She kissed me, I kissed her.

1441
01:39:22,125 --> 01:39:24,791
These two guys kissed that girl
and she kissed someone else.

1442
01:39:27,333 --> 01:39:30,125
I didn't expect this of you.

1443
01:39:30,375 --> 01:39:31,291
I swear, by God!

1444
01:39:31,583 --> 01:39:33,791
Bauua Singh ran away for love.

1445
01:39:34,625 --> 01:39:35,458
Honestly.

1446
01:39:35,708 --> 01:39:39,333
If he's come back, it's not for love.
He's conning you.

1447
01:39:39,333 --> 01:39:41,000
Babita, how do you bear this guy?

1448
01:39:41,166 --> 01:39:43,500
- For ten months, he's...
- Shut up!

1449
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:46,125
What did you bring for Babita?

1450
01:39:46,333 --> 01:39:50,833
This silly ring? How much was it?

1451
01:39:50,833 --> 01:39:53,416
A million rupees? Two million?

1452
01:39:53,416 --> 01:39:55,583
Let me show you
what I've brought her.

1453
01:39:55,583 --> 01:39:56,416
Look!

1454
01:39:57,333 --> 01:40:00,375
Only for Babita.
Diamonds.

1455
01:40:01,125 --> 01:40:02,500
A locket.

1456
01:40:02,875 --> 01:40:04,458
A chain.

1457
01:40:04,625 --> 01:40:06,375
A chocolate.

1458
01:40:07,375 --> 01:40:08,458
A birthday card.

1459
01:40:08,458 --> 01:40:09,833
Look.

1460
01:40:10,333 --> 01:40:11,541
A ribbon.

1461
01:40:12,500 --> 01:40:15,166
A hair clip.

1462
01:40:15,416 --> 01:40:18,000
An Aadhar ID card.

1463
01:40:18,375 --> 01:40:19,875
Why are you laughing?

1464
01:40:19,875 --> 01:40:23,666
What did you bring?
You've brought her a crappy ring.

1465
01:40:23,875 --> 01:40:26,000
A nasty little ring.

1466
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:27,666
A mean little ring.

1467
01:40:27,875 --> 01:40:31,541
- Enough!
- Leave my hand.

1468
01:40:31,750 --> 01:40:33,625
- Get out from here!
- Your nasty ring.

1469
01:40:33,625 --> 01:40:36,958
Lover boy! Listen to me.

1470
01:40:36,958 --> 01:40:39,041
Just arrived?
The party's over.

1471
01:40:39,041 --> 01:40:43,458
You lot come here all dolled up,
looking for fun.

1472
01:40:43,458 --> 01:40:45,708
You'll drink, you'll blow air kisses.

1473
01:40:45,708 --> 01:40:47,791
You love to party.

1474
01:40:47,791 --> 01:40:50,583
- Get out!
- While I love spoiling them.

1475
01:40:51,041 --> 01:40:53,500
Get out! What did you think?

1476
01:40:53,708 --> 01:40:56,583
If I bothered to talk to you,
you'd become special for me?

1477
01:40:56,583 --> 01:40:59,541
I spoil you rotten
and you exploit me?

1478
01:40:59,541 --> 01:41:02,875
- Get out!
- Humiliate me some more.

1479
01:41:02,875 --> 01:41:06,250
Or else I'll never leave.
Humiliate me some more.

1480
01:41:06,750 --> 01:41:09,166
- You're a zero, Bauua Singh!
- Humiliate me more.

1481
01:41:09,166 --> 01:41:12,666
You're nothing. You have zero status.
Your wheelchair girl is zero.

1482
01:41:12,666 --> 01:41:14,750
You'll achieve nothing.

1483
01:41:14,750 --> 01:41:17,416
Be with her but you'll still be zero.

1484
01:41:17,416 --> 01:41:21,166
- Don't hold back, Babita.
- Go home, Bauua.

1485
01:41:21,500 --> 01:41:24,750
This time tell the people
of Meerut that...

1486
01:41:24,750 --> 01:41:28,250
...Babita Kumari kicked you
out of her house.

1487
01:41:28,583 --> 01:41:31,041
Your wheelchair girl
didn't believe I kissed you...

1488
01:41:31,041 --> 01:41:32,708
...but she'll believe I threw you out.

1489
01:41:32,916 --> 01:41:37,416
- You're nearly there. A little more.
- I'm done with you.

1490
01:41:37,625 --> 01:41:41,750
Want to be disgraced some more?
Go jump in the lake. Out!

1491
01:41:45,666 --> 01:41:46,500
Done?

1492
01:41:52,541 --> 01:41:54,000
Thank you, Babita.

1493
01:42:06,458 --> 01:42:07,875
Who's the celebrity?

1494
01:42:16,875 --> 01:42:17,958
Thank you, fans.

1495
01:42:18,583 --> 01:42:19,583
Sir...sir...

1496
01:42:33,708 --> 01:42:36,583
Hello, everyone. Party's over.

1497
01:42:36,583 --> 01:42:38,500
DJ! Stop the music!

1498
01:42:39,125 --> 01:42:42,416
Put all the plates,
glasses and bottles...

1499
01:42:42,666 --> 01:42:44,458
...in the kitchen.

1500
01:42:44,666 --> 01:42:47,958
Hey, Aunty! Wake up. Very good.

1501
01:42:49,125 --> 01:42:51,583
What are you waiting for?

1502
01:42:51,583 --> 01:42:54,375
[indistinct chatter]

1503
01:42:56,458 --> 01:42:58,416
[indistinct chatter]

1504
01:43:00,125 --> 01:43:01,625
Mr. Kapoor...

1505
01:43:03,416 --> 01:43:05,875
- ...did you drive here?
- Yes, why?

1506
01:43:06,166 --> 01:43:07,583
You'd better go.

1507
01:43:08,750 --> 01:43:10,750
Leave your glass in the sink.

1508
01:43:13,541 --> 01:43:14,958
Take her with you.

1509
01:43:16,750 --> 01:43:19,083
Baby wants to party some more.

1510
01:43:19,291 --> 01:43:20,750
What are you up to?

1511
01:43:24,583 --> 01:43:27,708
I'm asking you to get out.
Politely.

1512
01:43:29,375 --> 01:43:31,916
Should I say it some other way?

1513
01:43:32,291 --> 01:43:35,083
You know another way?

1514
01:43:37,750 --> 01:43:39,583
Who do you think you are?

1515
01:43:41,750 --> 01:43:42,791
An angel!

1516
01:43:43,333 --> 01:43:45,583
I sprout wings behind closed doors.

1517
01:43:47,125 --> 01:43:50,375
I can't break every heart
in this country for your sake.

1518
01:44:07,625 --> 01:44:08,250
Hello.

1519
01:44:08,250 --> 01:44:10,583
Guddu, where are you?

1520
01:44:10,750 --> 01:44:13,666
As far as I remember you ran off
a year ago. I'm still here.

1521
01:44:13,666 --> 01:44:17,625
- Want to go to America?
- Muslims get visas? Take me then.

1522
01:44:17,833 --> 01:44:21,208
Done. Bring my passport with you
and meet me in Mumbai.

1523
01:44:21,541 --> 01:44:22,541
OK.

1524
01:44:22,541 --> 01:44:23,750
- Listen.
- Yes?

1525
01:44:23,958 --> 01:44:24,916
Bro...

1526
01:44:26,625 --> 01:44:30,875
...the bride for me?
She's the previous girl.

1527
01:44:32,500 --> 01:44:33,208
Yes.

1528
01:44:36,541 --> 01:44:38,125
Aafia!

1529
01:44:40,583 --> 01:44:43,583
- Bablu, what's that dye?
- Henna.

1530
01:44:44,708 --> 01:44:48,083
Forget the henna. Make me blonde.

1531
01:44:49,416 --> 01:44:50,416
Full blonde!

1532
01:44:59,916 --> 01:45:01,583
- Bauua Singh?
- Present.

1533
01:45:02,166 --> 01:45:04,125
They want to take my photo.

1534
01:45:04,458 --> 01:45:06,000
Look here, please.

1535
01:45:08,500 --> 01:45:10,333
Whoever we choose...

1536
01:45:10,333 --> 01:45:13,500
...will be asleep
on his journey to Mars.

1537
01:45:14,041 --> 01:45:17,583
Believe me, this will be so simple...

1538
01:45:17,583 --> 01:45:22,333
...that we can even prepare
a chimpanzee to do this.

1539
01:45:23,708 --> 01:45:27,791
And that's exactly what we've done.

1540
01:45:29,625 --> 01:45:33,166
You think this is a joke.

1541
01:45:33,375 --> 01:45:38,250
Ladies and gentlemen,
let me present...

1542
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:40,791
"Jndya.

1543
01:45:43,458 --> 01:45:44,666
Come, come.

1544
01:45:48,666 --> 01:45:49,708
Come, come.

1545
01:46:01,291 --> 01:46:03,833
- Hope you're not scared, Guddu?
- Why should I be?

1546
01:46:04,041 --> 01:46:06,541
They didn't arrest me at the airport.

1547
01:46:06,541 --> 01:46:08,958
Can they arrest me here?

1548
01:46:08,958 --> 01:46:12,750
Forget them.
You're scared of seeing Aafia again.

1549
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:14,500
Why would I be scared? You should be.

1550
01:46:14,750 --> 01:46:16,500
Who ran after Babita? Me? Or you?

1551
01:46:16,500 --> 01:46:19,375
It'll be fine. I'll make it all right.

1552
01:46:19,375 --> 01:46:23,291
How long can Aafia be mad at me?
10, 15, 30 minutes?

1553
01:46:23,916 --> 01:46:27,333
Long live the Goddess!

1554
01:46:28,416 --> 01:46:29,375
What's that?

1555
01:46:30,458 --> 01:46:31,541
Fake tears?

1556
01:46:31,708 --> 01:46:32,666
It's love.

1557
01:46:35,583 --> 01:46:37,041
Do they bottle love now?

1558
01:46:37,291 --> 01:46:42,416
Indya has an experience
of over two hundred hours...

1559
01:46:42,416 --> 01:46:46,750
...working underwater on a module
of an international space station.

1560
01:46:47,083 --> 01:46:54,583
He can endure the zero G pressure
as much as our working astronauts.

1561
01:46:54,583 --> 01:47:02,166
He's fully trained to drive a vehicle
on the Martian surface.

1562
01:47:02,166 --> 01:47:08,166
And the best part
is Indya loves sleeping.

1563
01:47:10,250 --> 01:47:11,500
What she's saying?

1564
01:47:12,916 --> 01:47:16,291
- Something about Mars.
- Is she an astrologer?

1565
01:47:16,583 --> 01:47:18,750
...a monkey is a better idea...

1566
01:47:18,750 --> 01:47:23,625
...than getting extinct and starting
from a chimp again!

1567
01:47:44,583 --> 01:47:46,750
Indya,no.

1568
01:47:47,041 --> 01:47:49,958
- What's going on?
- The monkey's gone nuts.

1569
01:47:51,291 --> 01:47:52,375
Indya,no.

1570
01:47:55,791 --> 01:47:56,875
Stop!

1571
01:48:00,708 --> 01:48:02,041
Indya,no.

1572
01:48:03,041 --> 01:48:08,916
<i>If you promise to stay by my side...</i>

1573
01:48:09,166 --> 01:48:14,541
<i>...I will sing lovely songs to you</i>

1574
01:48:25,458 --> 01:48:30,750
<i>If you look at me and smile...</i>

1575
01:48:31,041 --> 01:48:32,958
<i>I will...</i>

1576
01:48:35,083 --> 01:48:37,375
- What was that?
- A gunshot.

1577
01:48:37,375 --> 01:48:39,041
- Who fired?
- Aafla.

1578
01:48:39,041 --> 01:48:41,416
- How?
- She has a gun.

1579
01:48:42,375 --> 01:48:44,250
- She's just scaring me.
- Scaring you?

1580
01:48:44,250 --> 01:48:46,166
Her hands shake.
That's Why you're alive.

1581
01:48:46,416 --> 01:48:49,166
We mustn't be scared.
We must be brave.

1582
01:48:49,166 --> 01:48:50,833
We? You must.

1583
01:48:50,833 --> 01:48:53,166
I paid Club Class for you to sightsee?

1584
01:48:53,166 --> 01:48:55,333
Come on get up. Go ahead.

1585
01:48:55,666 --> 01:48:58,541
Careful. She has five bullets left.

1586
01:48:58,750 --> 01:49:00,916
- You blind bat! I know how to count.
- Get up!

1587
01:49:02,916 --> 01:49:11,708
<i>I saw you...</i>

1588
01:49:12,375 --> 01:49:18,291
<i>...and my eyes refused to turn away</i>

1589
01:49:23,041 --> 01:49:24,708
How you've changed, Aafia.

1590
01:49:24,708 --> 01:49:26,541
Want a slap?

1591
01:49:27,458 --> 01:49:29,458
How dare you come here?
Get out!

1592
01:49:29,750 --> 01:49:30,791
Out!

1593
01:49:30,791 --> 01:49:33,750
I don't need permission
to meet my Wife, Papa.

1594
01:49:33,916 --> 01:49:35,833
Papa?

1595
01:49:36,166 --> 01:49:38,000
Ismail, throw this fellow out.

1596
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:39,625
Don't touch me.

1597
01:49:39,958 --> 01:49:41,666
Stop! I am holding a baby.

1598
01:49:41,666 --> 01:49:44,500
Get back, Ismail.
Let me talk to her.

1599
01:49:44,791 --> 01:49:46,000
Let me talk to her.

1600
01:49:46,208 --> 01:49:48,958
Aafia, I made a mistake. Forgive me.

1601
01:49:49,208 --> 01:49:51,083
I'm not a cuckoo. I'm a crow.

1602
01:49:51,375 --> 01:49:52,458
Forgive me.

1603
01:49:52,791 --> 01:49:55,875
I will caw around you all my life.

1604
01:49:57,208 --> 01:50:00,750
But you didn't stop me at our wedding.
You laughed at me.

1605
01:50:00,750 --> 01:50:02,833
- Shall I...
- Wait.

1606
01:50:02,833 --> 01:50:04,750
This kid's life is in my hands.

1607
01:50:04,750 --> 01:50:06,916
See that baby.

1608
01:50:07,583 --> 01:50:11,541
- Not "see." It's "look" at that baby.
- Look at that baby, swine.

1609
01:50:12,125 --> 01:50:13,541
She's your baby.

1610
01:50:15,291 --> 01:50:16,833
Aafia's daughter.

1611
01:50:52,375 --> 01:50:53,625
Is she like Aafla?

1612
01:51:01,541 --> 01:51:02,500
Or me?

1613
01:51:11,750 --> 01:51:13,916
So how can she be ours?

1614
01:51:23,666 --> 01:51:24,791
Stop!

1615
01:51:25,625 --> 01:51:26,375
Baaua.

1616
01:51:26,625 --> 01:51:27,791
Let him go.

1617
01:51:30,291 --> 01:51:37,416
<i>A perfect half dream...</i>

1618
01:51:37,625 --> 01:51:42,833
<i>...once came to me</i>

1619
01:51:43,041 --> 01:51:49,333
<i>Like a tear of happiness</i>

1620
01:51:49,541 --> 01:51:57,625
<i>Falling from my eyelid</i>

1621
01:52:05,083 --> 01:52:08,375
<i>O God, have mercy on me</i>

1622
01:52:09,041 --> 01:52:12,750
<i>My shadow seems cross with me</i>

1623
01:52:13,291 --> 01:52:17,291
<i>Knowingly, unknowingly</i>

1624
01:52:19,250 --> 01:52:23,333
<i>I find myself alone
again and again</i>

1625
01:52:23,333 --> 01:52:27,083
<i>Loneliness has no bounds</i>

1626
01:52:27,541 --> 01:52:31,666
<i>I find myself alone again and again</i>

1627
01:52:31,666 --> 01:52:35,208
<i>Loneliness has no bounds</i>

1628
01:52:44,625 --> 01:52:50,375
<i>My eyes do not moisten
with drops of dew</i>

1629
01:52:52,916 --> 01:52:58,625
<i>I could not belong to myself.
How could I belong to anyone?</i>

1630
01:53:00,916 --> 01:53:04,166
<i>The depths of my heart...</i>

1631
01:53:05,041 --> 01:53:08,833
<i>...seek the truth</i>

1632
01:53:09,083 --> 01:53:13,541
<i>Knowingly, unknowingly</i>

1633
01:53:17,583 --> 01:53:21,708
<i>I find myself alone
again and again</i>

1634
01:53:21,708 --> 01:53:25,125
<i>Loneliness has no bounds</i>

1635
01:53:34,375 --> 01:53:38,500
<i>See the happy world while
my heart is full of sorrow</i>

1636
01:53:38,500 --> 01:53:42,625
<i>See the happy world while
my heart is full of sorrow</i>

1637
01:53:42,625 --> 01:53:46,750
<i>O unfaithful heart of mine...</i>

1638
01:53:46,750 --> 01:53:50,583
<i>...let us learn to be faithful</i>

1639
01:53:50,875 --> 01:53:52,958
<i>I will win her,
make her mine...</i>

1640
01:53:52,958 --> 01:53:54,625
<i>...or sacrifice my life</i>

1641
01:53:55,125 --> 01:54:02,875
<i>My bad name foreshadows me</i>

1642
01:54:03,208 --> 01:54:08,083
<i>Knowingly, unknowingly</i>

1643
01:54:12,041 --> 01:54:16,166
<i>I call out to my beloved</i>

1644
01:54:16,166 --> 01:54:19,958
<i>I want to stay forever with you</i>

1645
01:54:20,416 --> 01:54:24,458
<i>I call out to my beloved</i>

1646
01:54:24,458 --> 01:54:27,833
<i>I want to stay forever with you</i>

1647
01:54:45,166 --> 01:54:51,958
<i>Being unfaithful did nothing for me</i>

1648
01:54:51,958 --> 01:54:59,416
<i>Let us see if faithfulness
will befriend me</i>

1649
01:54:59,416 --> 01:55:06,875
<i>Life turned its back and walked away</i>

1650
01:55:07,333 --> 01:55:14,625
<i>Let us see if it returns
to smile on me again</i>

1651
01:55:14,625 --> 01:55:21,333
<i>Losing everything is easy for me</i>

1652
01:55:21,333 --> 01:55:28,000
<i>Now I know how to regain what is lost</i>

1653
01:55:36,583 --> 01:55:37,708
Come on, Guddu.

1654
01:55:37,708 --> 01:55:39,125
This is all my fault.

1655
01:55:39,125 --> 01:55:42,125
I'll beg her forgiveness.
Oh, the doors are closed.

1656
01:55:42,125 --> 01:55:46,083
Brother! You with the specs!

1657
01:55:46,083 --> 01:55:47,166


1658
01:55:47,166 --> 01:55:48,000
Can I help you?

1659
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,875
- The wheelchair girl who gave a speech...
- Aafia?

1660
01:55:51,083 --> 01:55:53,916
Yes, Aafla. Has she left?

1661
01:55:54,125 --> 01:55:56,416
She's gone. I got here late.

1662
01:55:56,625 --> 01:55:58,416
Do you know her?

1663
01:55:58,416 --> 01:56:00,958
I'm her fiancé.

1664
01:56:02,125 --> 01:56:04,500
- Fancy?
- Must be her cousin.

1665
01:56:05,625 --> 01:56:09,666
Can you tell me where
I can find her?

1666
01:56:11,083 --> 01:56:12,083
Here's her card.

1667
01:56:12,291 --> 01:56:13,875
- Her card?
- All the best, gentlemen.

1668
01:56:13,875 --> 01:56:14,666
Goodnight.

1669
01:56:22,458 --> 01:56:23,625
Fancy!

1670
01:56:24,500 --> 01:56:28,791
- Guddu, he doesn't look like her cousin.
- You're right.

1671
01:56:30,208 --> 01:56:31,875
NSAR.

1672
01:56:40,500 --> 01:56:44,541
Guddu, our visa will expire
while we're standing in line here.

1673
01:56:44,541 --> 01:56:45,958
Let's sneak in.

1674
01:56:46,291 --> 01:56:49,291
This isn't the Delhi-Meerut tollbooth.
You can't sneak through.

1675
01:56:49,541 --> 01:56:53,083
Anyway, they think Muslims come here
to plant bombs. We'll get whacked.

1676
01:56:53,291 --> 01:56:56,250
- What shall we do?
- Ask this aunty.

1677
01:56:56,250 --> 01:56:57,541
- Shall I?

1678
01:56:57,750 --> 01:56:59,333
- Side, please.
- My space...

1679
01:56:59,541 --> 01:57:01,958
- Madam...
- Blind man coming.

1680
01:57:02,583 --> 01:57:04,833
We're middle-class Indians.

1681
01:57:05,041 --> 01:57:07,500
- Are you Indian?
- No, lower middle-class British.

1682
01:57:07,500 --> 01:57:09,750
- Quit India!
- The Kohinoor?

1683
01:57:09,750 --> 01:57:11,375
We'll tax you double.

1684
01:57:11,375 --> 01:57:14,250
What do you want?
I speak Hindi. So talk Hindi.

1685
01:57:14,250 --> 01:57:16,625
Oh! Why this crowd?

1686
01:57:16,833 --> 01:57:22,125
NSAR selects 7 people every 3 years
for their space programme.

1687
01:57:22,125 --> 01:57:25,000
They want to see if a
human can survive in space.

1688
01:57:25,166 --> 01:57:27,500
- Understand <i>“space?"</i>
- You mean "pace?"

1689
01:57:27,750 --> 01:57:30,833
- Beyond the sky. Up there.
- Oh, that space!

1690
01:57:30,833 --> 01:57:33,875
- Can a man survive there?
- Okay. Okay.

1691
01:57:34,041 --> 01:57:36,041
There's 6 months of tests.

1692
01:57:36,041 --> 01:57:39,208
Today's the first selection round.
You get paid too!

1693
01:57:39,208 --> 01:57:41,750
- You're in the right place.
- We've come to see Miss Aafla.

1694
01:57:41,750 --> 01:57:43,208
She works here.

1695
01:57:43,208 --> 01:57:46,458
She approves the candidates.
References don't work.

1696
01:57:46,458 --> 01:57:49,416
- But shortcuts will!
- Bauua Singh.

1697
01:57:49,416 --> 01:57:51,250
- Who is Bauua Singh?
- Present!

1698
01:57:51,583 --> 01:57:54,208
- Here you go, sir.
- Blind man coming.

1699
01:57:55,041 --> 01:57:56,375
- Blind man.
- That way?

1700
01:57:56,708 --> 01:57:57,791
That way?

1701
01:57:57,791 --> 01:58:00,625
- You've got the pass?
- D'you see this?

1702
01:58:00,791 --> 01:58:03,250
- We've got the pass.
- Aafia knows us.

1703
01:58:05,541 --> 01:58:07,625
What's wrong?

1704
01:58:07,625 --> 01:58:08,583
What's this?

1705
01:58:08,791 --> 01:58:12,041
Where is Aafla?
I want to see her, please!

1706
01:58:12,041 --> 01:58:13,333
- I want to see her.
- What's wrong?

1707
01:58:13,333 --> 01:58:16,666
- You need to leave the premises.
- Let me go, please.

1708
01:58:16,666 --> 01:58:19,416
Let me go. One minute.

1709
01:58:19,416 --> 01:58:21,333
Aafia is getting married.

1710
01:58:30,833 --> 01:58:31,583
Let him in.

1711
01:58:31,583 --> 01:58:34,375
Sir, we're sending you inside.

1712
01:58:34,375 --> 01:58:37,916
- Yes, yes.
- Let us go. We won't come back.

1713
01:58:55,250 --> 01:58:56,791
Hey, come on. Let's go.

1714
01:59:34,416 --> 01:59:35,291
Aafia?

1715
01:59:35,291 --> 01:59:36,875
I just wanted to apologies.

1716
01:59:37,208 --> 01:59:40,666
I swear by the Goddess.
I knew nothing about the child.

1717
01:59:44,416 --> 01:59:47,041
What's this invite?

1718
01:59:48,625 --> 01:59:52,250
Why are you marrying someone else
when you love me?

1719
01:59:54,041 --> 01:59:58,625
You may not love me anymore,
but I still love you.

1720
01:59:59,666 --> 02:00:03,500
Aafia, you were right when you said
we were made for each other.

1721
02:00:03,875 --> 02:00:05,791
We're a match made...

1722
02:00:34,041 --> 02:00:37,375
Stop barking and listen to me.

1723
02:00:37,750 --> 02:00:40,500
Now we're truly equals, Bauua.

1724
02:00:40,666 --> 02:00:45,833
We could talk eye to eye, that's all.
I've stooped to your level.

1725
02:00:45,833 --> 02:00:48,791
Your arrogant ways, your status,
your class.

1726
02:00:49,458 --> 02:00:53,583
"I didn't know about the child,
Aafla." Do you think I knew?

1727
02:00:53,791 --> 02:00:55,916
When I came to your house...

1728
02:00:55,916 --> 02:00:59,500
...I came to tell you
not to be nervous, Bauua.

1729
02:00:59,500 --> 02:01:02,541
If I liked you, it was my problem.

1730
02:01:02,541 --> 02:01:05,583
You wanted to change
your phone number, fine!

1731
02:01:05,583 --> 02:01:09,416
But your father said:
"Fix the wedding date...

1732
02:01:09,416 --> 02:01:11,125
"...fix the wedding date."

1733
02:01:11,666 --> 02:01:13,458
Go away, Bauua.

1734
02:01:14,208 --> 02:01:17,208
There's nothing left of Aafla.

1735
02:01:55,791 --> 02:01:57,958
Did you think...

1736
02:01:59,791 --> 02:02:02,250
...I came all this way
looking for you...

1737
02:02:03,916 --> 02:02:05,208
...only to leave again?

1738
02:02:05,583 --> 02:02:08,250
So you're trying it on?

1739
02:02:08,625 --> 02:02:14,083
You may be brave,
but you have no feelings.

1740
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:32,833
Hey, middle-class Indian!

1741
02:02:32,833 --> 02:02:34,875
Why are you looking miserable?

1742
02:02:35,125 --> 02:02:37,791
Well? Your shortcut didn't work?

1743
02:02:38,500 --> 02:02:39,833
Want my help?

1744
02:02:46,583 --> 02:02:48,750
[indistinct chatter]

1745
02:02:48,958 --> 02:02:52,958
- How old are you?
- What's age? I'm 38. 39.

1746
02:02:52,958 --> 02:02:54,041
And you?

1747
02:02:54,625 --> 02:02:58,583
<i>The quarrel between you and me...</i>

1748
02:02:58,583 --> 02:03:00,916
<i>...is an empty quarrel</i>

1749
02:03:05,291 --> 02:03:09,083
<i>All lovers argue,
so you're mad at me...</i>

1750
02:03:09,291 --> 02:03:11,500
<i>...for a fleeting moment</i>

1751
02:03:13,208 --> 02:03:15,875
- ThesmelofgasremlndsmeofMeemL
- Yep.

1752
02:03:15,875 --> 02:03:20,375
<i>I'm all around you...</i>

1753
02:03:20,833 --> 02:03:25,250
<i>...so how can we never speak?</i>

1754
02:03:26,083 --> 02:03:31,166
<i>Though you look at me
with different eyes...</i>

1755
02:03:31,583 --> 02:03:36,416
<i>...my feelings are unchanged</i>

1756
02:03:37,625 --> 02:03:42,291
<i>Come what may, I'll never let you go</i>

1757
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:47,291
Come <i>What may,
I 7! never let you go</i>

1758
02:03:48,166 --> 02:03:52,250
<i>I'll belong to you alone</i>

1759
02:03:53,625 --> 02:03:56,625
<i>You can never get mad at me</i>

1760
02:04:01,291 --> 02:04:05,166
<i>The quarrel between you and me...</i>

1761
02:04:05,166 --> 02:04:07,250
<i>...is an empty quarrel</i>

1762
02:04:11,958 --> 02:04:15,791
<i>All lovers argue,
so you're mad at me...</i>

1763
02:04:15,791 --> 02:04:18,500
<i>...for a fleeting moment</i>

1764
02:05:07,875 --> 02:05:13,750
<i>I'll smile to lessen my sadness...</i>

1765
02:05:13,750 --> 02:05:18,166
<i>...though my smiles seem false to me</i>

1766
02:05:18,500 --> 02:05:21,875
<i>Every day I'm filled with fear...</i>

1767
02:05:21,875 --> 02:05:27,416
<i>...that you may break my heart
by mistake</i>

1768
02:05:28,416 --> 02:05:31,750
<i>No matter how you treat me...</i>

1769
02:05:31,750 --> 02:05:33,708
<i>...it will feel like love to me</i>

1770
02:05:33,708 --> 02:05:39,000
<i>Not knowing my boundaries
has always been my way</i>

1771
02:05:39,583 --> 02:05:44,416
<i>Being alone is not easy</i>

1772
02:05:44,791 --> 02:05:49,958
<i>Loneliness is hard to endure</i>

1773
02:05:50,291 --> 02:05:55,583
<i>My name so longs...</i>

1774
02:05:55,583 --> 02:06:01,291
<i>...to be united with yours</i>

1775
02:06:01,500 --> 02:06:05,458
<i>Come what may, I'll never let you go</i>

1776
02:06:06,958 --> 02:06:11,708
<i>Come what may, I'll never let you go</i>

1777
02:06:12,250 --> 02:06:17,041
<i>I'll belong to you alone</i>

1778
02:06:17,583 --> 02:06:21,500
<i>You can never get mad at me</i>

1779
02:06:24,583 --> 02:06:28,958
<i>The quarrel between you and me...</i>

1780
02:06:29,208 --> 02:06:32,666
<i>...is an empty quarrel</i>

1781
02:06:35,958 --> 02:06:39,791
<i>All lovers argue,
so you're mad at me...</i>

1782
02:06:39,791 --> 02:06:42,041
<i>...for a fleeting moment</i>

1783
02:07:07,125 --> 02:07:11,458
I like this Bauua Singh.
Mr. Shorty is good.

1784
02:07:11,666 --> 02:07:13,500
He's small but resilient.

1785
02:07:13,875 --> 02:07:16,833
He's only passed
his 10th grade, Srini.

1786
02:07:16,833 --> 02:07:20,125
Sorry, I forgot your chimpanzee
graduated from MIT.

1787
02:07:21,166 --> 02:07:23,125
We don't need an astronaut.

1788
02:07:23,125 --> 02:07:26,000
He has to sleep all the way
to Mars and back.

1789
02:07:26,375 --> 02:07:29,208
We just need someone
who'll take the risk.

1790
02:07:31,958 --> 02:07:38,166
Aafia, I haven't figured out
if you love or hate this shorty.

1791
02:07:38,625 --> 02:07:41,625
But trust me, a man at my age,
I couldn't care less.

1792
02:07:41,625 --> 02:07:45,666
I don't have anything in my life beside
this project and your brains, Aafia.

1793
02:07:46,458 --> 02:07:49,333
I don't know about you.

1794
02:07:50,458 --> 02:07:51,750
Yeah, fine.

1795
02:07:52,291 --> 02:07:53,583
I don't understand.

1796
02:08:01,916 --> 02:08:03,125
Srini...

1797
02:08:04,166 --> 02:08:08,666
...I feel angry all of a sudden.

1798
02:08:10,583 --> 02:08:14,000
And I feel like crying too.

1799
02:08:15,041 --> 02:08:16,416
I am going to go now.

1800
02:08:16,625 --> 02:08:18,375
I'll see you at the office.

1801
02:08:18,791 --> 02:08:21,833
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine. I'll see you.

1802
02:09:37,458 --> 02:09:39,375
Are you angry with me?

1803
02:09:40,416 --> 02:09:43,958
You're the one who's angry.
I'm trying to make it up to you.

1804
02:09:44,916 --> 02:09:47,250
Do you love me?

1805
02:09:47,541 --> 02:09:48,791
What do you think?

1806
02:09:50,458 --> 02:09:52,666
You love me a lot.

1807
02:09:55,041 --> 02:09:56,166
Do you love me?

1808
02:10:02,750 --> 02:10:06,375
Will you do something for me?

1809
02:10:07,625 --> 02:10:08,416
Anything.

1810
02:10:09,666 --> 02:10:11,291
Go away.

1811
02:10:16,875 --> 02:10:18,958
Let me attend your wedding first.

1812
02:10:20,833 --> 02:10:22,125
Then I'll go.

1813
02:10:23,958 --> 02:10:25,750
Run away, Bauua.

1814
02:10:25,958 --> 02:10:28,375
You're so good at running.

1815
02:10:28,583 --> 02:10:32,666
Break my heart then.
Like you've been doing.

1816
02:10:33,041 --> 02:10:35,916
You'll die, you dog!

1817
02:10:37,458 --> 02:10:39,208
Then watch me die.

1818
02:10:40,125 --> 02:10:41,708
I'll watch.

1819
02:10:45,125 --> 02:10:50,416
The Mission Mars team is impressed
by your performance, Bauua.

1820
02:10:50,833 --> 02:10:52,750
Your reports are amazing.

1821
02:10:53,041 --> 02:10:55,375
So's your endurance.

1822
02:10:55,750 --> 02:10:58,583
You have a high pain threshold.
You're sharp.

1823
02:10:58,791 --> 02:11:01,291
Applied intelligence is excellent.

1824
02:11:02,166 --> 02:11:04,583
The team says ideally...

1825
02:11:04,583 --> 02:11:09,125
...they would need a man like you
for the mission, not a monkey.

1826
02:11:09,375 --> 02:11:11,500
I agree with them.

1827
02:11:11,500 --> 02:11:14,666
But you'd be risking your life.

1828
02:11:14,666 --> 02:11:17,375
It wouldn't matter to you
because you love me.

1829
02:11:17,375 --> 02:11:21,125
That poor monkey is
so attached to his family.

1830
02:11:21,125 --> 02:11:27,333
While the very thought of your family
makes you uncomfortable.

1831
02:11:27,875 --> 02:11:30,333
The rocket's very safe, Bauua.

1832
02:11:30,500 --> 02:11:34,958
But I'll pray it crashes
on re-entry.

1833
02:11:37,916 --> 02:11:40,125
Oh, I see.

1834
02:11:42,333 --> 02:11:44,625
Is that how you'll get rid of me?

1835
02:11:45,041 --> 02:11:46,416
Scare me away.

1836
02:11:51,208 --> 02:11:54,375
You can't bear marrying
anyone else when I'm around.

1837
02:11:58,208 --> 02:11:59,708
Admit it!

1838
02:12:00,416 --> 02:12:01,833
Go on.

1839
02:12:02,333 --> 02:12:04,041
OK, I'll do it for you.

1840
02:12:04,791 --> 02:12:07,791
Who knows where you're sending me
or what you're asking.

1841
02:12:08,125 --> 02:12:09,916
But on the day it happens...

1842
02:12:11,833 --> 02:12:13,583
...make sure you get married.

1843
02:12:15,583 --> 02:12:18,000
Bauua Singh isn't running this time.

1844
02:12:19,416 --> 02:12:24,083
The words you just said,
you'll forget them all...

1845
02:12:24,333 --> 02:12:28,583
...when you're in the shuttle
travelling at 30,000kmph.

1846
02:12:29,041 --> 02:12:34,333
The second you hear the noise
it makes, you'll make a run for it.

1847
02:12:34,583 --> 02:12:35,916
When they count...

1848
02:12:36,208 --> 02:12:42,083
- 10...9...8...7...6...
- Hello!

1849
02:12:42,500 --> 02:12:46,083
When I was even shorter,
I could count backwards.

1850
02:12:46,500 --> 02:12:50,333
5...4...3...2...1...zero.

1851
02:12:50,625 --> 02:12:53,541
Launch me in your rocket!

1852
02:13:00,875 --> 02:13:01,916
Did a star fall?

1853
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:09,708
At last!

1854
02:13:28,416 --> 02:13:31,625
God bless the stars!

1855
02:13:38,291 --> 02:13:40,791
Let anyone try to
stop Bauua Singh now.

1856
02:13:50,541 --> 02:13:52,833
What happened?
Did those two patch up?

1857
02:13:53,041 --> 02:13:56,416
[regional language]

1858
02:13:57,083 --> 02:13:59,541
Your friend will go to Mars.

1859
02:13:59,541 --> 02:14:00,583
Where?

1860
02:14:00,583 --> 02:14:02,166
The planet Mars.

1861
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:06,500
Does he know that?

1862
02:14:06,916 --> 02:14:08,208
I hope so.

1863
02:14:13,250 --> 02:14:15,291
God forgive us!

1864
02:14:16,083 --> 02:14:19,041
We were sending him to Mars...

1865
02:14:19,416 --> 02:14:22,083
...but now we're sending
Bauua Singh instead.

1866
02:14:22,375 --> 02:14:24,625
But sister-in-law,
if Bauua goes to Mars...

1867
02:14:24,625 --> 02:14:26,166
...who will I take with
me back to Meerut, this chimp.

1868
02:14:26,166 --> 02:14:29,208
He has no one out here except for you.

1869
02:14:29,958 --> 02:14:32,958
So you'll have to be his guardian.

1870
02:14:33,166 --> 02:14:35,125
You must sign papers statin..

1871
02:14:35,125 --> 02:14:38,875
...that if anything happens
to him during this mission...

1872
02:14:38,875 --> 02:14:41,500
...then we cannot be held accountable.

1873
02:14:41,750 --> 02:14:42,708
Understood.

1874
02:14:42,708 --> 02:14:43,958
What do you mean?

1875
02:14:44,375 --> 02:14:46,083
Well, for starters he can die.

1876
02:14:46,375 --> 02:14:48,875
God forgive us! The punishment for running
away from his wedding can't be death.

1877
02:14:49,208 --> 02:14:51,416
He's a little guy, who couldn't
achieve anything big on Earth...

1878
02:14:51,416 --> 02:14:52,625
...what does he stand
to achieve on Mars?

1879
02:14:52,625 --> 02:14:54,791
He's no use to you.
Please stop him.

1880
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:57,375
Stop the Charade.

1881
02:14:58,416 --> 02:15:01,916
And anyway,
he's going to run away eventually.

1882
02:15:02,458 --> 02:15:03,833
So let him do it now.

1883
02:15:04,041 --> 02:15:05,666
It's will save our money.

1884
02:15:05,916 --> 02:15:07,041
You talk to him.

1885
02:15:07,041 --> 02:15:09,291
He's not listening to me.
But he will listen to you.

1886
02:15:09,625 --> 02:15:11,708
I am busy with my wedding.

1887
02:15:12,375 --> 02:15:14,833
How long do you think will
it take to say "Stop Bauua"?

1888
02:15:15,583 --> 02:15:16,833
A lot.

1889
02:15:17,458 --> 02:15:19,375
And then,
there's my engagement tomorrow.

1890
02:15:19,708 --> 02:15:23,583
Then the musical nite,
followed by some more functions.

1891
02:15:23,875 --> 02:15:28,708
Then I've an appointment at the parlor,
the wedding dress trial as well.

1892
02:15:28,916 --> 02:15:30,500
So I am very busy.

1893
02:15:32,625 --> 02:15:33,708
Sign that.

1894
02:15:34,083 --> 02:15:36,666
You know what.

1895
02:15:36,666 --> 02:15:39,375
...meet him between the beauty
parlor appointment and the tailor.

1896
02:15:39,833 --> 02:15:41,166
Sign.
Gud...du...

1897
02:15:45,458 --> 02:15:47,208
What do you eat?

1898
02:15:48,166 --> 02:15:51,125
Practically anything,
As long as it's Halal (Holy).

1899
02:16:03,666 --> 02:16:07,750
Bauua, what's going on?
The whites are applauding.

1900
02:16:07,958 --> 02:16:11,833
We're from Meerut, Bauua!
We dunk biscuits in our tea.

1901
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:15,083
What do we care about rockets?
Or Mars?

1902
02:16:15,083 --> 02:16:18,833
Isn't Mars a faraway planet?
It's not a place to go sightseeing.

1903
02:16:18,833 --> 02:16:22,125
Wake up! Mars is not Saharanpur
from where you can sprint.

1904
02:16:22,291 --> 02:16:23,583
It's Mars!

1905
02:16:24,500 --> 02:16:26,083
She won't let me go.

1906
02:16:26,458 --> 02:16:28,125
I've seen the look in her eyes.

1907
02:16:28,458 --> 02:16:31,333
She can't do it.
The girl will stop me.

1908
02:16:36,291 --> 02:16:38,250
We are on the verge
of a very big mission.

1909
02:16:38,250 --> 02:16:42,458
And tomorrow we decide when this
decade-long dream becomes a reality.

1910
02:16:42,791 --> 02:16:44,791
We sign off on the take-off date.

1911
02:16:44,791 --> 02:16:46,875
The next 48 hours are crucial.

1912
02:16:48,458 --> 02:16:51,875
Once it reaches Mars, the
gravity of Mars will slow it down...

1913
02:16:51,875 --> 02:16:54,375
...and finally we'll enter in orbit
around Mars...
