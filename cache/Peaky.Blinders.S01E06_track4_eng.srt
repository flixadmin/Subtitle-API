1
00:00:03,321 --> 00:00:04,321
Mr Churchill.

2
00:00:04,401 --> 00:00:06,761
If there are bodies to be buried...

3
00:00:06,881 --> 00:00:08,961
Dig holes.

4
00:00:09,121 --> 00:00:10,361
And dig them deep.

5
00:00:10,721 --> 00:00:11,801
Don't do this in here.

6
00:00:11,881 --> 00:00:13,601
You're taking me away from my baby!

7
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:14,841
- Freddie!
- Ada!

8
00:00:15,921 --> 00:00:18,721
It wasn't me who shot Freddie Thorne.

9
00:00:19,721 --> 00:00:21,481
He trusts me, I told you that.

10
00:00:21,841 --> 00:00:23,281
I think I know where
the guns are hidden.

11
00:00:24,281 --> 00:00:28,761
I want your word that Thomas Shelby will
not be harmed if the guns are recovered.

12
00:00:31,921 --> 00:00:34,801
It would be an honour
to work with you, Mr Kimber.

13
00:00:35,081 --> 00:00:38,921
Nobody works "with" me.
People work "for" me.

14
00:00:40,201 --> 00:00:42,401
Black star. What does that mean?

15
00:00:42,881 --> 00:00:46,561
Black star day is the day we take
out Billy Kimber and his men.

16
00:00:48,761 --> 00:00:50,401
Grace...

17
00:00:50,481 --> 00:00:51,521
Will you marry me?

18
00:00:52,841 --> 00:00:53,841
You deserve better.

19
00:00:54,401 --> 00:00:55,401
Is it him?

20
00:00:56,881 --> 00:00:58,921
- Where is he?
- He left.

21
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:01,281
With the barmaid.

22
00:02:26,001 --> 00:02:27,121
Service?

23
00:02:30,521 --> 00:02:32,001
We don't open two more hours.

24
00:02:32,081 --> 00:02:33,201
You come back later.

25
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:35,801
Police.

26
00:02:41,481 --> 00:02:43,081
Inspector Campbell, sir.

27
00:02:44,481 --> 00:02:45,601
Any trouble, sir?

28
00:02:46,841 --> 00:02:48,081
Look...

29
00:02:49,121 --> 00:02:50,281
I know.

30
00:02:51,561 --> 00:02:52,641
I know.

31
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:55,881
That is,

32
00:02:55,961 --> 00:02:58,481
I'm given to understand by
several of my officers...

33
00:03:00,601 --> 00:03:04,201
Several of my officers
that people come here...

34
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,161
That men come here for...

35
00:03:09,761 --> 00:03:10,921
a certain purpose.

36
00:03:25,601 --> 00:03:27,681
Arthur. Arthur, wake up!

37
00:03:29,161 --> 00:03:32,601
Get home, get bathed,
check your kids, check your weapons.

38
00:03:35,721 --> 00:03:36,801
Why?

39
00:03:39,441 --> 00:03:40,561
What's going on?

40
00:03:42,641 --> 00:03:43,841
We're doing it today.

41
00:03:47,241 --> 00:03:53,201
<i># Where secrets lie in the border fires
in the humming wires</i>

42
00:03:53,281 --> 00:03:56,801
<i># Hey man, you know
you're never coming back #</i>

43
00:03:56,921 --> 00:03:58,521
Fetch the wagons, Charlie.

44
00:03:59,241 --> 00:04:00,321
It's today.

45
00:04:03,601 --> 00:04:07,801
<i># On a gathering storm comes
a tall handsome man</i>

46
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:12,401
<i># In a dusty black coat with
a red right hand #</i>

47
00:04:27,241 --> 00:04:28,561
I'll be there in a minute, mate!

48
00:04:31,761 --> 00:04:33,761
john, I've told you to keep
the doors locked.

49
00:04:34,081 --> 00:04:35,361
It could have been anyone.

50
00:04:35,761 --> 00:04:36,801
Get dressed.

51
00:04:37,441 --> 00:04:38,481
We're doing it today.

52
00:04:38,601 --> 00:04:40,361
As a matter of fact,
he's doing me today.

53
00:04:40,561 --> 00:04:41,841
Make sure he's done you by 9:00.

54
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:43,321
You should learn to knock!

55
00:04:43,401 --> 00:04:44,721
It's not a day for knocking.

56
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:49,721
Dear Lord, make this day pass well.

57
00:04:51,681 --> 00:04:52,921
Let none get hurt,

58
00:04:53,521 --> 00:04:55,641
and make them that do not Shelbys.

59
00:04:57,641 --> 00:04:58,721
Watch john,

60
00:04:59,681 --> 00:05:01,481
'cause he has so many depending on him.

61
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:04,161
<i>Watch Arthur,</i>

62
00:05:05,201 --> 00:05:08,201
because he's as likely to hurt
himself as anyone else.

63
00:05:09,881 --> 00:05:10,961
Watch Thomas.

64
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,161
I know how he is.

65
00:05:15,401 --> 00:05:17,801
But he does what he does for us.

66
00:05:19,961 --> 00:05:21,081
I think.

67
00:05:22,401 --> 00:05:23,521
Amen.

68
00:05:30,241 --> 00:05:32,201
I used to do that every
morning during the war.

69
00:05:32,721 --> 00:05:34,321
Think'd I'd done it for the last time.

70
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:36,761
Today will be the last time, Poll.

71
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:41,441
After today, there'll be
no need for prayers.

72
00:05:42,281 --> 00:05:43,441
We'll be set.

73
00:05:46,001 --> 00:05:47,721
Family meeting, half-ten.

74
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:03,121
I'm sorry I kept you.

75
00:06:03,681 --> 00:06:04,801
It is so early.

76
00:06:05,961 --> 00:06:07,081
That's all right.

77
00:06:07,721 --> 00:06:09,721
I, I didn't sleep last night.

78
00:06:12,921 --> 00:06:15,961
Mr Zhang said that you
are special, special customer.

79
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:29,401
Do you want to sit?

80
00:06:38,561 --> 00:06:40,201
Do you want to take off your boots?

81
00:06:42,081 --> 00:06:43,161
Yes.

82
00:06:52,281 --> 00:06:53,321
And,

83
00:06:53,401 --> 00:06:54,521
this.

84
00:07:00,281 --> 00:07:01,481
So tight.

85
00:07:14,401 --> 00:07:17,281
We can also clean and press
your shirt while we do this.

86
00:07:18,321 --> 00:07:20,841
Ah, that's a very efficient service.

87
00:07:22,841 --> 00:07:25,001
You've never been to a
place like this before?

88
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:28,761
It's okay.

89
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:32,521
Sometimes old men who lost
their wives, they come here

90
00:07:32,721 --> 00:07:33,961
all the time.

91
00:07:34,681 --> 00:07:35,721
Old men?

92
00:07:36,441 --> 00:07:37,481
I am so old?

93
00:07:37,561 --> 00:07:39,201
No, I mean...

94
00:07:39,721 --> 00:07:41,721
I am young. Anyway---

95
00:07:44,281 --> 00:07:45,761
I will make you young as well.

96
00:08:46,761 --> 00:08:47,881
Whore.

97
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:02,721
<i>Dear Grace,</i>

98
00:09:03,481 --> 00:09:06,521
<i>I write this letter to you
with a heavy heart.</i>

99
00:09:07,161 --> 00:09:09,521
<i>I know exactly what you did.</i>

100
00:09:10,161 --> 00:09:11,281
<i>And with whom.</i>

101
00:09:12,281 --> 00:09:15,121
<i>I will not mention any
of it in my report.</i>

102
00:09:15,561 --> 00:09:18,041
<i>However, you should be aware</i>

103
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:22,521
<i>that I know you gave yourself to
the man who is our sworn enemy.</i>

104
00:09:23,201 --> 00:09:24,761
<i>That is not only treason,</i>

105
00:09:26,241 --> 00:09:29,041
<i>it is disgusting beyond all measure.</i>

106
00:09:29,681 --> 00:09:31,681
<i>Your father would be ashamed of you.</i>

107
00:09:32,481 --> 00:09:35,921
<i>And as for myself,
I am beyond desolation.</i>

108
00:09:36,361 --> 00:09:40,361
<i>You have betrayed every principle
and standard of honour</i>

109
00:09:40,441 --> 00:09:42,201
<i>that was your birth right.</i>

110
00:09:43,401 --> 00:09:45,041
<i>And, for what?</i>

111
00:09:46,921 --> 00:09:48,001
Love.

112
00:10:10,481 --> 00:10:11,921
Oh, my God, I'm sorry, did I do that?

113
00:10:12,961 --> 00:10:14,121
It's okay.

114
00:10:14,601 --> 00:10:16,361
You are special, special customer.

115
00:10:17,921 --> 00:10:19,201
Would you sit with me for a moment?

116
00:10:20,001 --> 00:10:21,041
Please?

117
00:10:55,601 --> 00:10:56,681
For the suits.

118
00:10:57,721 --> 00:10:59,161
You want to hear something funny?

119
00:11:26,401 --> 00:11:27,481
I am unarmed.

120
00:11:32,641 --> 00:11:34,001
It's curious, Inspector.

121
00:11:34,841 --> 00:11:37,041
I thought you came here
to clean up the city.

122
00:11:37,681 --> 00:11:39,321
Not to sleep with its whores.

123
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:45,001
You're no different from any other
copper that came before you.

124
00:11:46,241 --> 00:11:49,441
I'm no different from those who would
follow, should I choose to leave.

125
00:11:49,841 --> 00:11:51,401
Oh, you've no reason to stay.

126
00:11:52,241 --> 00:11:53,681
You have what you came for.

127
00:11:53,841 --> 00:11:55,201
Yes, I have what I came for.

128
00:11:57,441 --> 00:12:00,281
I have a meeting with
Mr Winston Churchill at midday.

129
00:12:01,681 --> 00:12:03,241
And, no doubt, he intends to

130
00:12:03,321 --> 00:12:05,801
congratulate me on
finding those stolen guns.

131
00:12:06,921 --> 00:12:10,121
And you still don't know how we
found them, do ya?

132
00:12:11,801 --> 00:12:12,841
Good.

133
00:12:12,921 --> 00:12:14,281
Oh, you got lucky.

134
00:12:14,681 --> 00:12:15,801
Did I?

135
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:17,081
Yeah.

136
00:12:18,201 --> 00:12:19,841
One thing I have learned

137
00:12:21,801 --> 00:12:24,441
is that you and I are opposites.

138
00:12:24,761 --> 00:12:26,321
But also just the same.

139
00:12:28,801 --> 00:12:30,521
Like an image in a mirror.

140
00:12:33,401 --> 00:12:35,441
We hate people.

141
00:12:37,401 --> 00:12:38,841
And they in turn

142
00:12:39,561 --> 00:12:40,641
hate us.

143
00:12:41,801 --> 00:12:43,121
And fear us.

144
00:12:47,881 --> 00:12:49,401
Before the day is over,

145
00:12:50,321 --> 00:12:52,081
your heart will be broken.

146
00:12:53,281 --> 00:12:54,881
Just the same as mine.

147
00:12:58,761 --> 00:13:00,441
Men like us, Mr Shelby,

148
00:13:02,201 --> 00:13:03,681
will always be alone.

149
00:13:05,721 --> 00:13:07,361
And the love we get,

150
00:13:08,681 --> 00:13:10,121
we will have to pay for.

151
00:13:11,881 --> 00:13:14,361
You forget, Inspector,

152
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,241
I have my family.

153
00:13:21,121 --> 00:13:22,521
Enjoy your day.

154
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:35,921
Oh, little one.

155
00:13:36,521 --> 00:13:38,361
You're much better with him than I am.

156
00:13:40,761 --> 00:13:43,201
He settles quicker with me
because he can't smell the milk.

157
00:13:43,561 --> 00:13:45,121
You're tired.

158
00:13:45,681 --> 00:13:46,841
Let's put him down.

159
00:13:52,121 --> 00:13:53,841
Mine were terrors for the tit.

160
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,121
Both of them.

161
00:13:57,561 --> 00:13:59,321
Well, you never knew
my children, did you?

162
00:13:59,721 --> 00:14:01,321
I was a child myself then.

163
00:14:03,881 --> 00:14:05,241
You never talk about them.

164
00:14:06,561 --> 00:14:08,041
I've no reason to.

165
00:14:12,001 --> 00:14:13,801
Heart breaks even when
I think about them.

166
00:14:18,241 --> 00:14:19,321
But, today,

167
00:14:20,761 --> 00:14:22,241
I do have reason to.

168
00:14:23,121 --> 00:14:24,521
Sit down, Ada.

169
00:14:33,601 --> 00:14:35,281
They were three and five years old.

170
00:14:37,481 --> 00:14:43,081
Sally was three, Michael was five,
well, two weeks away from being six.

171
00:14:46,081 --> 00:14:47,521
It was Sunday morning,

172
00:14:47,841 --> 00:14:49,241
I was at church...

173
00:14:53,161 --> 00:14:54,601
"You're not forgiven."

174
00:14:55,841 --> 00:14:56,921
This...

175
00:14:57,961 --> 00:15:00,281
Pinched-faced bitch said to me,
"You're not forgiven."

176
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:03,881
You see, some sheets I'd
washed and hung on the line

177
00:15:03,961 --> 00:15:05,921
had the name of a hotel in them.

178
00:15:06,001 --> 00:15:07,321
They'd been stolen in a robbery,

179
00:15:07,401 --> 00:15:10,521
and they said some porter
at the hotel had been coshed.

180
00:15:11,881 --> 00:15:14,601
And a woman from around here
told the police about the sheets.

181
00:15:14,881 --> 00:15:17,201
Jealous, you see, about the new sheets.

182
00:15:17,561 --> 00:15:18,881
And when the police came,

183
00:15:19,361 --> 00:15:21,561
they found a spirits still.

184
00:15:22,481 --> 00:15:24,481
Making a few drops of gin.

185
00:15:28,441 --> 00:15:29,601
And for that...

186
00:15:32,561 --> 00:15:34,601
They took my children from me.

187
00:15:37,481 --> 00:15:39,561
And they never told me
where they took them.

188
00:15:40,961 --> 00:15:44,041
And they did it 'cause they could,
and 'cause I was weak.

189
00:15:44,721 --> 00:15:47,121
They will never take your
baby away from you.

190
00:15:47,801 --> 00:15:48,881
Do you know why?

191
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:51,961
'Cause Tommy won't let them.

192
00:15:52,521 --> 00:15:54,841
'Cause Tommy won't let
them walk all over us.

193
00:15:55,681 --> 00:15:58,841
Now, it is Tommy that has brought
strength and power to this family.

194
00:16:00,561 --> 00:16:01,601
'Cause he knows...

195
00:16:02,841 --> 00:16:05,641
You have to be as bad as them
above in order to survive.

196
00:16:08,441 --> 00:16:11,521
I'm telling you this because
I want you to forgive him.

197
00:16:11,641 --> 00:16:12,761
How can I?

198
00:16:13,121 --> 00:16:15,241
When my Freddie's rotting
in jail because of him.

199
00:16:16,761 --> 00:16:18,841
There's something about
today you need to know.

200
00:16:33,641 --> 00:16:35,681
All right, Freddie.
Time to go.

201
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:37,401
I want to get a message to Campbell.

202
00:16:38,681 --> 00:16:40,281
I can't let them move me to Brixton.

203
00:16:42,321 --> 00:16:44,601
If I go to Brixton, they'll kill me.

204
00:16:45,161 --> 00:16:46,241
Freddie...

205
00:16:46,921 --> 00:16:48,761
You're not going to get as
far as Brixton prison.

206
00:16:51,441 --> 00:16:52,521
You're free.

207
00:16:53,761 --> 00:16:55,521
I told
the Prime Minister personally

208
00:16:55,601 --> 00:16:57,201
that the guns have been retrieved,

209
00:16:57,281 --> 00:16:59,041
and he actually heard me and listened,

210
00:17:00,081 --> 00:17:02,481
and I'm pretty sure he
gave me a half smile.

211
00:17:02,561 --> 00:17:05,921
He never usually smiles unless
a political opponent dies.

212
00:17:07,761 --> 00:17:11,201
I've plan to put your name
forward in the New Year's Honours List.

213
00:17:13,161 --> 00:17:14,961
- That would be too much, sir.
- Nonsense.

214
00:17:15,281 --> 00:17:16,361
You deserve it.

215
00:17:17,081 --> 00:17:21,161
As I recall, you wrote to me several
times about an undercover operative,

216
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:22,321
a woman.

217
00:17:24,801 --> 00:17:26,881
Was she involved in the discovery?

218
00:17:31,521 --> 00:17:33,961
Does she deserve some
kind of commendation?

219
00:17:40,761 --> 00:17:41,841
Yes.

220
00:17:42,401 --> 00:17:44,081
She was instrumental.

221
00:17:44,641 --> 00:17:46,961
A truly loyal servant to the Crown.

222
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:49,481
And that is what the
record should state.

223
00:17:50,521 --> 00:17:54,481
And what of the men who actually
stole the guns? The Peaky...

224
00:17:55,161 --> 00:17:56,201
Blinders, sir.

225
00:17:59,401 --> 00:18:00,921
If we were to make arrests,

226
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:04,561
the whole thing would end up in
open court, and I know we wish to

227
00:18:04,641 --> 00:18:06,201
keep this matter confidential.

228
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:08,201
So they'll go free?

229
00:18:08,481 --> 00:18:09,641
Not quite, sir.

230
00:18:11,401 --> 00:18:12,801
See, I have plans

231
00:18:13,681 --> 00:18:14,921
for the Peaky Blinders.

232
00:18:19,081 --> 00:18:20,121
All right?

233
00:18:23,961 --> 00:18:25,641
Leave that, boys,
we'll get back to it later.

234
00:18:25,721 --> 00:18:26,841
Right.

235
00:18:26,921 --> 00:18:28,441
We've brought you all here today

236
00:18:29,081 --> 00:18:32,201
'cause this is the day
we replace Billy Kimber.

237
00:18:32,681 --> 00:18:34,921
This is the day we become respectable.

238
00:18:35,441 --> 00:18:42,161
The day we join the official National
Association of Racecourse Bookmakers.

239
00:18:43,961 --> 00:18:45,081
But, first,

240
00:18:45,841 --> 00:18:46,921
we do the dirty work.

241
00:18:47,721 --> 00:18:49,681
Now, you've all known
this day's been coming,

242
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:51,281
I just haven't told anyone the date.

243
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:57,281
We're going to the Worcester races.

244
00:18:57,721 --> 00:18:59,721
Track opens at 1:00,
we get there at 2:00.

245
00:19:00,241 --> 00:19:03,001
Now, Kimber thinks we're going there
to help him fight the Lee brothers.

246
00:19:04,201 --> 00:19:05,921
Thanks to the efforts of our john

247
00:19:06,521 --> 00:19:08,401
and his lovely new wife, Esme,

248
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,681
the Lees are now our kin.

249
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:13,841
I interrupted those efforts this morning
and, uh,

250
00:19:14,081 --> 00:19:17,761
I can assure you all,
john is making great sacrifices

251
00:19:18,481 --> 00:19:19,961
in the cause of peace.

252
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,081
Yea h, a ll rig ht.

253
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:24,961
So it'll be us and the Lees against
Kimber's boys.

254
00:19:25,681 --> 00:19:28,161
We take 'em out and leave the bookies.

255
00:19:28,881 --> 00:19:32,201
I'll expect a swift victory which will
send a signal all the way to London

256
00:19:32,281 --> 00:19:37,521
that we believe in letting legitimate
businesses run peacefully.

257
00:19:38,281 --> 00:19:41,401
JOHN:
And, uh, what about Kimber himself?

258
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:43,801
I'll deal with Kimber.

259
00:19:44,321 --> 00:19:45,481
Any other questions?

260
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:48,641
Yes.

261
00:19:51,681 --> 00:19:54,441
Does anyone object if I bring
a newcomer to the meeting?

262
00:19:59,321 --> 00:20:00,321
Come on.

263
00:20:02,841 --> 00:20:06,641
I'd like to introduce the newest member
of the Shelby clan.

264
00:20:16,881 --> 00:20:18,161
Welcome home, Ada.

265
00:20:19,921 --> 00:20:20,961
We named him Karl.

266
00:20:21,961 --> 00:20:23,041
After Karl Marx.

267
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:25,081
Karl bloody Marx.

268
00:20:25,161 --> 00:20:26,441
Let me get a look at him.

269
00:20:26,521 --> 00:20:27,761
Oh, here we go.

270
00:20:28,121 --> 00:20:29,161
Hey, look!

271
00:20:29,921 --> 00:20:31,641
He looks just like me, look!

272
00:20:32,801 --> 00:20:35,281
- Unless his arse looks like you.
- He's all right.

273
00:20:35,921 --> 00:20:37,081
He's a Shelby.

274
00:20:37,801 --> 00:20:38,881
Well, Ada...

275
00:20:40,561 --> 00:20:41,921
Am I forgiven?

276
00:20:42,601 --> 00:20:45,761
If what Aunt Polly says is true,
you are.

277
00:20:47,761 --> 00:20:48,841
It's true.

278
00:20:51,921 --> 00:20:53,081
Thank you, Tommy.

279
00:20:58,201 --> 00:20:59,441
So who the hell are you?

280
00:20:59,961 --> 00:21:01,721
Someone who wants to keep his eyes.

281
00:21:02,841 --> 00:21:04,361
They came to my house,

282
00:21:05,281 --> 00:21:07,481
told me to volunteer for this.

283
00:21:07,761 --> 00:21:08,801
Who did?

284
00:21:09,921 --> 00:21:11,001
The Peaky Blinders.

285
00:21:18,761 --> 00:21:20,481
Tommy, Tommy, Tommy.

286
00:22:13,681 --> 00:22:14,681
Get out of the way!

287
00:22:18,201 --> 00:22:19,361
What the bloody hell is that?

288
00:22:19,721 --> 00:22:21,201
Looks like your friends are here.

289
00:22:26,361 --> 00:22:29,361
Stay down on the ground!
Or the next one's for you.

290
00:22:33,601 --> 00:22:34,601
<i>Uh'.!</i>

291
00:22:34,681 --> 00:22:35,961
Make it look good.

292
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:38,441
I am sorry about this, comrade.

293
00:22:40,081 --> 00:22:41,081
Holy shit!

294
00:22:41,601 --> 00:22:44,241
- Danny, you're dead!
- No. I've been living in London.

295
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:45,441
Same thing.

296
00:22:46,321 --> 00:22:47,321
In you get.

297
00:22:54,641 --> 00:22:55,921
All right, lads, listen up.

298
00:22:56,001 --> 00:22:59,361
You have a pint and a chaser,
no more, on the house.

299
00:23:00,841 --> 00:23:03,681
Right. Let's get pouring.

300
00:23:04,721 --> 00:23:06,481
Do you have the enclosure tickets?

301
00:23:06,641 --> 00:23:08,441
And the registered bookkeepers
on the track?

302
00:23:08,841 --> 00:23:09,921
In me coat.

303
00:23:11,481 --> 00:23:12,881
You did a good job, Grace.

304
00:23:14,001 --> 00:23:15,001
- Much.
- Much.

305
00:23:18,201 --> 00:23:19,521
Next family meeting,

306
00:23:20,121 --> 00:23:21,241
I'll make sure you're there.

307
00:23:22,681 --> 00:23:23,841
If I were family.

308
00:23:24,481 --> 00:23:25,841
But I'm not.

309
00:23:27,121 --> 00:23:28,281
That could change.

310
00:23:29,721 --> 00:23:31,081
- Tommy...
- We'll talk about it more

311
00:23:31,161 --> 00:23:32,641
when I get back, all right?

312
00:23:32,721 --> 00:23:33,761
When will you be back?

313
00:23:34,041 --> 00:23:35,961
Oh, is this how it's gonna be, eh?

314
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:38,681
You waiting at home for me,

315
00:23:39,201 --> 00:23:40,521
saying, "What time do you call this?"

316
00:23:42,281 --> 00:23:43,841
The barrel needs changing.

317
00:23:47,201 --> 00:23:51,001
Go on, Tom. Go out the back,
give her a good seeing to before we go.

318
00:23:59,361 --> 00:24:00,401
All right?

319
00:24:01,201 --> 00:24:03,201
Hey, Grace, I was joking.

320
00:24:03,481 --> 00:24:06,121
Tommy, we need more mild.

321
00:24:06,281 --> 00:24:08,001
Just help yourselves!

322
00:24:10,601 --> 00:24:11,721
Tommy, the truth is...

323
00:24:12,401 --> 00:24:14,161
When you come back from the races,
I won't be here.

324
00:24:16,001 --> 00:24:17,081
What are you talking about?

325
00:24:19,321 --> 00:24:20,441
All right, look.

326
00:24:20,521 --> 00:24:23,361
Grace, I know you weren't born
to be with a man like me.

327
00:24:25,961 --> 00:24:27,441
But I'm turning things around.

328
00:24:28,201 --> 00:24:31,641
When I get back here tonight,
I will have

329
00:24:32,361 --> 00:24:36,481
one of the biggest legal race track
syndicates in the country.

330
00:24:38,401 --> 00:24:40,961
I'm gonna close down
some of that other stuff.

331
00:24:43,201 --> 00:24:44,401
Maybe open a club.

332
00:24:45,961 --> 00:24:47,641
Hey, back in London.

333
00:24:49,241 --> 00:24:50,361
And another thing,

334
00:24:53,281 --> 00:24:54,881
you have a contract of employment.

335
00:24:55,681 --> 00:24:58,081
With a real limited company.

336
00:24:58,681 --> 00:24:59,761
You remember?

337
00:25:00,401 --> 00:25:01,961
I remember everything, Tommy.

338
00:25:02,401 --> 00:25:03,961
I am going to a make a success of this.

339
00:25:05,441 --> 00:25:07,041
I am going to a make a success of it.

340
00:25:07,441 --> 00:25:08,601
- I am.
- I know.

341
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:10,361
I know.

342
00:25:11,881 --> 00:25:13,641
I'm not talking about marriage.

343
00:25:14,641 --> 00:25:15,721
I'm so...

344
00:25:17,561 --> 00:25:18,641
We know each other.

345
00:25:19,121 --> 00:25:20,281
We can talk.

346
00:25:21,201 --> 00:25:22,281
We're the same.

347
00:25:23,081 --> 00:25:26,121
Tommy,
I've done something terrible to you.

348
00:25:29,201 --> 00:25:31,521
Right. Tell him what you just told me.

349
00:25:32,161 --> 00:25:34,121
Just heard there's two vans driving up
the Stratford Road.

350
00:25:34,401 --> 00:25:36,681
An old corporal of mine said
he recognised some of the men.

351
00:25:36,761 --> 00:25:38,081
He said it's the Kimber boys.

352
00:25:38,441 --> 00:25:39,521
And they're heading this way.

353
00:25:47,801 --> 00:25:48,921
Ada! Wake up!

354
00:25:49,001 --> 00:25:51,881
You and the baby, get into the bullring
where there's lots of people.

355
00:25:51,961 --> 00:25:54,161
- What's going on?
- We've been fucking betrayed.

356
00:25:54,281 --> 00:25:56,881
Someone let slip.
Kimber's men are on their way here.

357
00:25:57,281 --> 00:25:59,601
- Yeah, but you can handle them, Tommy.
- It's just us.

358
00:25:59,721 --> 00:26:02,041
All the Lees are on their way to
Worcester, we're outnumbered.

359
00:26:02,641 --> 00:26:03,641
Fuck!

360
00:26:03,721 --> 00:26:06,441
Who else knew today was the day
you were moving on Kimber?

361
00:26:06,801 --> 00:26:09,201
You said you kept it a secret.
Who else did you tell?

362
00:26:12,801 --> 00:26:15,321
There's only one thing can blind
a man as smart as you, Tommy.

363
00:26:16,201 --> 00:26:17,241
Love.

364
00:26:17,441 --> 00:26:18,601
It's that barmaid.

365
00:26:21,561 --> 00:26:23,241
I'll deal with Grace.

366
00:26:24,001 --> 00:26:26,641
If you set eyes on her again,
you might kill her.

367
00:26:43,921 --> 00:26:45,041
Going for good?

368
00:26:45,321 --> 00:26:46,401
I heard there was trouble.

369
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:48,721
Instinct's a funny thing.

370
00:26:50,441 --> 00:26:53,081
See, normally I can tell about a person,
but with you...

371
00:26:53,201 --> 00:26:54,921
Look, the fighting's about to begin.

372
00:26:55,361 --> 00:26:57,361
- We should get out of here.
- We know who you are.

373
00:27:00,961 --> 00:27:02,081
Tommy knows as well.

374
00:27:03,161 --> 00:27:05,401
Turned out that copper as good as
told him this morning.

375
00:27:05,641 --> 00:27:07,841
But I wanted to hear it
from your own lips.

376
00:27:13,641 --> 00:27:15,441
I am an agent of the Crown.

377
00:27:15,641 --> 00:27:18,921
I have the power to arrest
and the right to use force.

378
00:27:19,121 --> 00:27:22,041
So please, step out of my way.

379
00:27:22,121 --> 00:27:25,841
Like I say, instinct's a funny thing.
You fell for Tommy for real, didn't you?

380
00:27:27,561 --> 00:27:28,801
This gun is loaded.

381
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:30,801
I'm not afraid of you.

382
00:27:31,801 --> 00:27:33,041
I feel sorry for you.

383
00:27:34,161 --> 00:27:35,281
Slip of a thing.

384
00:27:36,241 --> 00:27:38,161
Thought you'd come in here and stitch us
all up.

385
00:27:38,241 --> 00:27:40,961
I mean, we've had some copper's narks
in here, but you...

386
00:27:41,841 --> 00:27:42,921
You're the queen of them all.

387
00:27:45,921 --> 00:27:47,001
So who are you?

388
00:27:49,081 --> 00:27:50,521
Rich girl, I'd guess.

389
00:27:51,641 --> 00:27:54,881
Unionist. Ulster Volunteer.

390
00:27:56,321 --> 00:28:01,801
You thought, "Fenians, communists,
low people...

391
00:28:02,641 --> 00:28:05,681
"They're all the same. Scum."

392
00:28:06,801 --> 00:28:07,961
Then you met Tommy.

393
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:16,281
I'll fight you with my fists
and show you how a rich girl fights.

394
00:28:17,241 --> 00:28:18,881
I'm from a tough family, too.

395
00:28:26,281 --> 00:28:27,481
Nah.

396
00:28:29,681 --> 00:28:31,161
We women have more sense.

397
00:28:33,081 --> 00:28:34,601
Why don't you pour us both a drink?

398
00:28:48,001 --> 00:28:49,161
So am I right?

399
00:28:53,281 --> 00:28:54,641
Did you fall for Tommy?

400
00:29:03,561 --> 00:29:04,641
Yes, I did.

401
00:29:05,041 --> 00:29:06,161
Then I pity you.

402
00:29:07,601 --> 00:29:09,161
You think he'll try to kill me?

403
00:29:10,241 --> 00:29:11,321
That's too soft.

404
00:29:11,481 --> 00:29:12,921
- Soft?
-Soft.

405
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:15,001
Like you.

406
00:29:15,801 --> 00:29:17,761
You saved his life the night
the coppers came.

407
00:29:19,281 --> 00:29:21,201
That's why we're drinking, not fighting.

408
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:23,961
We owe you.

409
00:29:30,161 --> 00:29:31,281
What was he like?

410
00:29:32,641 --> 00:29:33,721
Before France?

411
00:29:35,521 --> 00:29:38,041
He laughed. A lot.

412
00:29:40,041 --> 00:29:41,801
He wanted to work with horses.

413
00:29:44,361 --> 00:29:45,441
He won medals?

414
00:29:45,521 --> 00:29:46,601
Threw them in the cut.

415
00:29:48,241 --> 00:29:50,441
Not a single man came back the same.

416
00:29:52,881 --> 00:29:55,761
You know, after all this is over,

417
00:29:57,561 --> 00:29:58,721
he might forgive you.

418
00:29:59,601 --> 00:30:00,681
He might take you in.

419
00:30:01,041 --> 00:30:02,121
Can never tell with men.

420
00:30:02,921 --> 00:30:06,281
They go for whoever their dicks point at
and there's no changing their minds.

421
00:30:06,641 --> 00:30:07,841
But I should tell you something.

422
00:30:09,961 --> 00:30:11,401
I will never forgive you.

423
00:30:13,041 --> 00:30:14,521
Or accept you.

424
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:16,521
Or take you in.

425
00:30:18,361 --> 00:30:21,081
And it's me who runs the business
of the heart in this family.

426
00:30:22,961 --> 00:30:24,561
And as far as I'm concerned,

427
00:30:25,521 --> 00:30:27,321
you're a snitch from the parish.

428
00:30:28,681 --> 00:30:30,841
And if you're not gone from this city
by tomorrow,

429
00:30:32,481 --> 00:30:33,761
I'll kill you myself.

430
00:30:39,961 --> 00:30:41,041
Now go.

431
00:30:55,441 --> 00:30:57,321
Maybe what really upsets you

432
00:30:57,961 --> 00:30:59,921
is the thought that one day
you might lose him.

433
00:31:12,601 --> 00:31:15,241
Tommy! We've had word
from Nipper at Hay Mills,

434
00:31:15,321 --> 00:31:16,601
and he says
the police are letting them through.

435
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,561
And how come all our police
have disappeared?

436
00:31:19,641 --> 00:31:22,281
'Cause it was the police who told
Kimber about the plan.

437
00:31:22,441 --> 00:31:23,521
And who told the police?

438
00:31:23,601 --> 00:31:27,401
You know what,john?
For all I think I'm the smart one,

439
00:31:27,481 --> 00:31:29,321
I'm guessing it was me.

440
00:31:32,201 --> 00:31:33,281
All right, men.

441
00:31:36,401 --> 00:31:39,681
You were mostly in the war, so you know
that battle plans always change

442
00:31:39,761 --> 00:31:41,921
and get fucked up, well here it is.

443
00:31:42,241 --> 00:31:43,601
Things have changed.

444
00:31:43,801 --> 00:31:46,921
We fight them here. Today. Alone.

445
00:31:47,161 --> 00:31:48,721
Now, they're gonna come for the pub,

446
00:31:48,841 --> 00:31:50,921
they're gonna try
and break us up for good.

447
00:31:51,241 --> 00:31:53,481
And we'll have no help
from the law today.

448
00:31:55,081 --> 00:31:57,281
That pub there is called The Garrison!

449
00:31:57,441 --> 00:31:58,961
Well, now it really is one.

450
00:31:59,321 --> 00:32:01,521
And it belongs to us! Right?

451
00:32:01,601 --> 00:32:02,961
Right!

452
00:32:03,041 --> 00:32:04,121
How many are there?

453
00:32:04,321 --> 00:32:06,281
Jeremiah said two Reilly vans.

454
00:32:07,161 --> 00:32:09,201
So I reckon we're outnumbered
three to one.

455
00:32:09,281 --> 00:32:10,361
<i>ARTHUR". Ah, fuck.</i>

456
00:32:10,441 --> 00:32:12,961
But it's us, boys, it's us!

457
00:32:13,041 --> 00:32:15,121
The Small Heath rifles.

458
00:32:15,401 --> 00:32:17,161
Never lost a fight yet, did we?

459
00:32:17,241 --> 00:32:18,601
- No!
- All right!

460
00:32:18,681 --> 00:32:23,241
Jeremiah, I know you vowed to God
to never pick up a weapon again.

461
00:32:23,321 --> 00:32:26,681
But can you ask him from me
if you can help us today.

462
00:32:28,041 --> 00:32:30,041
God says he done a deal
with Small Heath, sir.

463
00:32:30,121 --> 00:32:31,241
Good man!

464
00:32:31,321 --> 00:32:33,241
Arthur, Scudboat, you take the flanks.

465
00:32:33,321 --> 00:32:34,601
- Just like at St Marie.
- Sure.

466
00:32:34,681 --> 00:32:35,721
Curly.

467
00:32:35,801 --> 00:32:37,921
If any Shelby man dies here today,

468
00:32:38,321 --> 00:32:40,121
you bury us side by side.

469
00:32:41,201 --> 00:32:43,641
All right. We've about ten minutes.

470
00:32:43,921 --> 00:32:45,281
Make your peace with whoever.

471
00:32:49,681 --> 00:32:51,561
We've heard a report
of a large group of men

472
00:32:51,641 --> 00:32:53,641
in vehicles heading towards the city.

473
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:55,481
Most of them are
known to the police, sir.

474
00:32:55,881 --> 00:32:59,281
Uh. We think a gang fight's
about to break out.

475
00:32:59,961 --> 00:33:02,241
I want all officers
and constables

476
00:33:02,321 --> 00:33:04,201
stood down in the following areas.

477
00:33:04,961 --> 00:33:06,041
Bordesley,

478
00:33:06,321 --> 00:33:08,561
Small Heath, Shard End, Greet,

479
00:33:09,401 --> 00:33:11,161
-and Hay Mills.
- Stood down, sir?

480
00:33:11,241 --> 00:33:13,361
Immediately.
And the vehicles approaching the city

481
00:33:13,441 --> 00:33:16,121
-should not be impeded.
- What the hell is going on?

482
00:33:16,881 --> 00:33:18,321
Let dog eat dog.

483
00:33:19,881 --> 00:33:22,241
Let the beasts devour each other.

484
00:33:23,721 --> 00:33:25,841
And then we shall pick the bones.

485
00:33:40,521 --> 00:33:41,601
She's gone, then?

486
00:33:48,961 --> 00:33:51,641
You're not accustomed to not getting
what you want, are you, Tommy?

487
00:33:55,081 --> 00:33:57,041
You wanted my pub, and you took it.

488
00:34:07,721 --> 00:34:09,441
You got a fair price.

489
00:34:12,721 --> 00:34:15,081
What I got was an ultimatum.

490
00:34:15,841 --> 00:34:17,281
Like you give to everybody.

491
00:34:17,761 --> 00:34:19,241
Do it, or else.

492
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:22,441
And yet, it's funny,

493
00:34:23,441 --> 00:34:27,041
everybody around here,
they want you to win this battle.

494
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:31,081
I think what it is,

495
00:34:31,601 --> 00:34:34,961
you're bad men, but you're our bad men.

496
00:34:39,241 --> 00:34:40,401
Will you go looking for her?

497
00:34:45,161 --> 00:34:46,321
She's in the past.

498
00:34:50,361 --> 00:34:51,801
The past is not my concern.

499
00:34:56,121 --> 00:34:58,441
The future is no longer
my concern either.

500
00:34:58,521 --> 00:35:00,081
What is your concern, Tommy?

501
00:35:02,921 --> 00:35:04,001
One minute.

502
00:35:07,681 --> 00:35:09,401
<i>TOMMY". The soldier's minute.</i>

503
00:35:11,361 --> 00:35:12,761
In a battle, that's all you get.

504
00:35:16,241 --> 00:35:18,081
One minute of everything at once.

505
00:35:22,641 --> 00:35:24,321
Anything before is nothing.

506
00:35:27,401 --> 00:35:28,481
Everything after,

507
00:35:29,641 --> 00:35:30,801
nothing.

508
00:35:33,241 --> 00:35:34,601
Nothing in comparison

509
00:35:35,921 --> 00:35:37,041
to that one minute.

510
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:45,241
Didn't you get enough minutes
over there?

511
00:35:52,081 --> 00:35:53,481
Seems not, doesn't it?

512
00:35:57,401 --> 00:35:58,601
Tommy, they're here!

513
00:36:44,401 --> 00:36:46,721
Get your weapons out, boys,
and load 'em up.

514
00:36:50,961 --> 00:36:52,401
Take your time.

515
00:36:53,561 --> 00:36:56,401
Hold 'em up in the air so's they can see
what we've got.

516
00:37:04,881 --> 00:37:07,961
All guns and no balls,
right, Billy boy?

517
00:37:16,961 --> 00:37:20,121
So what do we do now?
just give the order.

518
00:37:43,721 --> 00:37:46,921
The men that have arrived in Garrison
Lane, they're armed with rifles.

519
00:37:49,201 --> 00:37:50,321
Did you hear me?

520
00:37:51,081 --> 00:37:54,281
Their methods of self-destruction
are not my concern.

521
00:37:54,761 --> 00:37:58,481
Well, we've outside reports of
machine gun fire in Saltley.

522
00:37:59,121 --> 00:38:01,521
It's the ravings of an old soldier
with shell shock.

523
00:38:02,201 --> 00:38:06,561
We only found 24 of those 25 Lewis guns.
If they were to get use of one...

524
00:38:11,121 --> 00:38:16,281
You know, uh... When you came here
from Belfast, I was overjoyed.

525
00:38:17,121 --> 00:38:20,401
I was sick of this force,
and I was sick of all the corruption.

526
00:38:20,921 --> 00:38:23,881
When you made that speech
about cleaning this place up,

527
00:38:24,401 --> 00:38:26,401
I gave a little cheer inside.

528
00:38:29,481 --> 00:38:32,401
You said it was the devil's work
to look the other way.

529
00:38:32,521 --> 00:38:35,521
I am not looking the other way,
Sergeant Moss.

530
00:38:35,881 --> 00:38:38,521
I am looking directly
at the events of the day!

531
00:38:39,001 --> 00:38:40,641
And I like what I see.

532
00:38:48,561 --> 00:38:50,321
It doesn't have
to be like this, Kimber.

533
00:38:50,641 --> 00:38:52,681
It's too late for all that.

534
00:38:53,041 --> 00:38:55,161
You've bit off more than you can chew,
you little toe-rag,

535
00:38:55,241 --> 00:38:57,201
and now I'm going
to take over this shithole.

536
00:38:57,321 --> 00:39:00,801
Well... If we have to use guns...

537
00:39:02,161 --> 00:39:04,281
Let's use proper guns!

538
00:39:10,361 --> 00:39:13,841
Sergeant Thorne reporting for duty, sir.

539
00:39:16,681 --> 00:39:18,841
You were saying something
about being out-gunned?

540
00:39:34,401 --> 00:39:35,441
Move!

541
00:39:39,321 --> 00:39:40,321
What are you doing?

542
00:39:40,441 --> 00:39:42,401
I believe you boys
call this "no man's land".

543
00:39:42,761 --> 00:39:44,481
- Ada!
- Shut up and listen.

544
00:39:44,561 --> 00:39:46,561
- Have you lost your mind?
- I said shut up!

545
00:39:49,481 --> 00:39:53,681
Now, most of you were in France.
So you all know what happens next.

546
00:39:54,921 --> 00:39:56,681
I've got brothers and a husband here,

547
00:39:57,001 --> 00:39:58,961
but you've all got
somebody waiting for you.

548
00:39:59,761 --> 00:40:01,961
Now, I'm wearing black in preparation.

549
00:40:04,521 --> 00:40:06,321
I want you to look at me.

550
00:40:09,401 --> 00:40:11,601
I want you all to look at me!

551
00:40:12,481 --> 00:40:14,201
We'll be wearing black for you.

552
00:40:16,041 --> 00:40:17,281
Think about them.

553
00:40:18,281 --> 00:40:19,921
Think about them right now,

554
00:40:21,201 --> 00:40:22,881
and fight if you want to,

555
00:40:23,601 --> 00:40:25,521
but that baby ain't moving anywhere.

556
00:40:27,321 --> 00:40:28,761
And neither am I.

557
00:40:34,201 --> 00:40:35,481
She's right, you know.

558
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:38,761
Why should all you men die?

559
00:40:39,481 --> 00:40:41,361
It should just be them whose caused it!

560
00:40:45,761 --> 00:40:47,401
Tommy, come here!

561
00:40:48,961 --> 00:40:51,921
Don't shoot!
You're all right, Son!

562
00:40:52,081 --> 00:40:53,681
- You're all right.
- Ada, move away!

563
00:40:55,401 --> 00:40:56,641
Don't shoot!

564
00:40:59,121 --> 00:41:01,001
Hold your guns up!

565
00:41:02,761 --> 00:41:04,401
Enough!

566
00:41:12,121 --> 00:41:14,761
Kimber and me fought
this battle one-on-one.

567
00:41:16,481 --> 00:41:17,681
It's over.

568
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:25,441
Go home to your families.

569
00:41:56,201 --> 00:41:59,561
Scudboat, Curly, pick him up.

570
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:33,961
I want to ask you one question.
Then I'll leave.

571
00:42:35,001 --> 00:42:38,401
Tommy knows who I am.
What did you say to him?

572
00:42:39,921 --> 00:42:41,801
What did you say to him?

573
00:42:46,761 --> 00:42:48,761
I told him...

574
00:42:49,761 --> 00:42:52,841
That his heart would be broken
before the day was over.

575
00:42:55,601 --> 00:43:00,481
So it seems...
You've broken two hearts, Grace.

576
00:43:04,401 --> 00:43:06,441
As well as my own.

577
00:43:17,321 --> 00:43:19,641
That's it, Tommy, that's it!
Fight it, Tommy!

578
00:43:19,801 --> 00:43:22,401
- No!
- Take it! Take it!

579
00:43:22,481 --> 00:43:24,361
- Hold him still!
- That's it, lad!

580
00:43:24,681 --> 00:43:26,281
Come on! Come on!

581
00:43:30,801 --> 00:43:34,281
- There! I still have the knack.
- Argh!

582
00:43:35,521 --> 00:43:38,481
Have a drink.

583
00:43:41,561 --> 00:43:43,841
All right. Deep breath!

584
00:43:44,601 --> 00:43:46,721
That's it. It's done!

585
00:44:09,801 --> 00:44:13,441
Now we can bury him properly,
in the grave we dug for him.

586
00:44:16,121 --> 00:44:20,881
Yeah. It's high on a hill.
He'll like that.

587
00:44:29,561 --> 00:44:31,641
- To Danny Whizz-Bang.
- Danny.

588
00:44:31,721 --> 00:44:33,641
May we all die twice.

589
00:44:37,081 --> 00:44:38,761
To Danny Whizz-Bang.

590
00:44:42,041 --> 00:44:44,121
Danny Whizz-Bang.

591
00:44:51,241 --> 00:44:53,081
Danny Whizz-Bang.

592
00:45:01,801 --> 00:45:06,641
Come on.
The day is ours. Let's celebrate.

593
00:45:30,361 --> 00:45:33,841
Well, who won?

594
00:45:35,081 --> 00:45:39,641
A Mr William Kimber has been found dead.
A gunshot wound.

595
00:45:40,641 --> 00:45:46,041
So, uh, I'm guessing that means
the Peaky Blinders won, sir.

596
00:45:48,321 --> 00:45:51,641
Also, the communist agitator,
Freddie Thorne,

597
00:45:51,721 --> 00:45:55,201
was taken from his transport
by armed men.

598
00:45:56,761 --> 00:45:59,601
Since there were no officers
on the street at the time,

599
00:45:59,681 --> 00:46:03,961
following your orders, he managed
to escape easily and he's now at large.

600
00:46:05,401 --> 00:46:08,401
The, er, prison officers said they
recognised the men.

601
00:46:08,481 --> 00:46:11,081
They were Peaky Blinders as well, sir.

602
00:46:12,761 --> 00:46:15,121
I mean, we could go down there
and make a few arrests,

603
00:46:15,201 --> 00:46:17,481
but no one will have seen anything.

604
00:46:18,521 --> 00:46:21,561
And there were no officers
there to witness, so...

605
00:46:23,081 --> 00:46:25,401
The Shelbys'll get away with murder.

606
00:46:26,241 --> 00:46:28,201
Just like they always have.

607
00:46:29,761 --> 00:46:33,241
Some things never change, eh, sir?

608
00:47:00,521 --> 00:47:04,601
- A toast! To Shelby, Limited!
- To Shelby, Limited!

609
00:47:10,241 --> 00:47:12,401
He's got sons.
Should we find work for them?

610
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:15,281
No. Let 'em be.

611
00:47:15,401 --> 00:47:18,241
Let them find ordinary work.
Like ordinary men.

612
00:48:03,321 --> 00:48:05,721
Could you put me through
to Mr Churchill, please?

613
00:48:08,201 --> 00:48:11,681
Yes, sir. Sir...

614
00:48:12,521 --> 00:48:16,001
I have made a decision about my future.

615
00:48:30,121 --> 00:48:32,401
Everyone's leaving town.

616
00:48:33,441 --> 00:48:35,241
- Tommy, you're hurt.
- I'm fine.

617
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:40,881
- What exactly can I say?
- I don't know, Grace.

618
00:48:43,881 --> 00:48:47,361
- If I tell you who I really am?
- I think I know who you are.

619
00:48:48,481 --> 00:48:50,761
- Okay.
- You know who I am?

620
00:48:50,961 --> 00:48:52,681
Circumstance is not important.

621
00:48:52,761 --> 00:48:56,161
- Circumstance.
- Is all it is.

622
00:48:58,281 --> 00:49:01,761
- Just uniform.
- Yeah.

623
00:49:07,321 --> 00:49:09,481
Someday I will throw
this gun in the canal.

624
00:49:10,241 --> 00:49:12,161
Why not now?

625
00:49:22,361 --> 00:49:24,521
Here it comes, Tommy.

626
00:49:27,001 --> 00:49:29,121
I love you.

627
00:49:30,921 --> 00:49:33,841
And there it goes, Grace.

628
00:49:35,081 --> 00:49:36,801
Away it goes.

629
00:49:38,281 --> 00:49:40,321
You can say it as much as you like.

630
00:49:42,961 --> 00:49:45,001
But there's no chance.

631
00:49:57,921 --> 00:50:01,081
I'll be in London one week.
This address.

632
00:50:01,521 --> 00:50:03,561
Finish your business here and join me.

633
00:50:06,681 --> 00:50:08,601
I have an idea.

634
00:50:25,161 --> 00:50:26,881
- There he is.
- Tommy!

635
00:50:27,041 --> 00:50:28,761
Drink?

636
00:50:33,361 --> 00:50:35,081
Not whisky.

637
00:50:38,001 --> 00:50:41,001
If you check behind the bar...

638
00:50:41,721 --> 00:50:44,441
You will find a bottle of champagne.

639
00:50:54,321 --> 00:50:55,481
One she bought?

640
00:51:02,761 --> 00:51:04,761
Today was a good day.

641
00:51:08,601 --> 00:51:10,601
All of Kimber's men were busy here.

642
00:51:11,561 --> 00:51:14,801
So the Lee boys took all the pitches
at the Worcester races.

643
00:51:17,801 --> 00:51:19,801
Couldn't have gone better
if we planned it.

644
00:51:20,681 --> 00:51:22,521
The Shelby Brothers, Limited,

645
00:51:23,041 --> 00:51:28,641
are now the third largest legal
racetrack operation in the country.

646
00:51:28,721 --> 00:51:29,761
Cheers.

647
00:51:29,841 --> 00:51:32,841
Only the Sabinis and the Solomons
are bigger than us, boys.

648
00:51:37,841 --> 00:51:39,921
And all my family
is here to celebrate.

649
00:51:44,881 --> 00:51:46,921
To Shelby Brothers, Limited!

650
