I'm sorry. I'm so sorry!

No, no, no, it's okay. It's okay.

8
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:26,276
Are.., are you okay?
Did you have a bad dream?

9
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:28,278
I don't know. [gasps] I'm...

10
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:31,031
How did I get here?

11
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:34,034
Well, you fell asleep
in front of the TV

12
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:35,577
and you just looked so peaceful,

13
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,287
so I didn't have the heart
to move you to the bed.

14

The dawn of time.

15

Dawn of time.

16
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:44,711
Is that what you were watching
before you nodded off?

17
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:45,879
Wait.

This isn't right.

20
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:53,345
Okay, well, I mean, it's right,
but it's not right because it's right.

21
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,264
Uh-huh. The White Martian
did a number on you last night.

22
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:59,142
"White Martian." White Martian.

Good timing.

Hey, uh... I had a really
weird dream last night.

46
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,780
Could you maybe help me interpret it?

47
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:54,823
What happened?

48
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,533
Uh, the world ended.

49
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,994
But, like, all the worlds.

50
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,454
All of them.

51
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,416
That's dramatic, even for us.

52
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,127
[host] And now, I am proud to introduce

53
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,713
the winner of this year's
Nobel Peace Prize,

54

Lex Luthor.

I know, right?

58
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:24,811
It is so great when this award goes to
someone who actually deserves it.

We live in dangerous times.

Earth is a dangerous place.

62
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:49,127
I suppose that's why
people love superheroes so much.

63
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:52,922
The power, the chutzpah...

64
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:56,468
Of someone who can fly
faster than a speeding bullet.

65
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,513
But that's what makes this so special.

66
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,807
I don't have any powers.

67
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,560
I can't leap tall buildings
in a single bound.

68
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:08,021
But I have dedicated my life

69
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:10,982
to fighting on the side of humanity,

70
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:15,028
and to be recognized for that
is more than I can put into words.

71
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,696
So, I will just say...

72
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,783
I stand with mankind.

What was Lex doing up there?

80
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,220
Well, they keep throwing
all these awards at him.

81
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:41,805
He doesn't
usually accept them in person,

82
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,348
but this one meant a lot to him.

83

He's the best guy.

No, he's not.

What? No, he...

89
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:55,193
He's the boss.

90
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:57,404
And he's your number-one supporter.

91
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:58,571
I mean, besides Lena.

92

And all the times
they defended you to the President...

Hang on.

Wait... Wait, did you just say "boss"?

No.

I know you must be confused.

I was too.

Is the result.

167
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:51,929
Wait, was there a crossover?

168
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:54,098
Were we invited? Did we win?

169
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,142
<i>[J'onn J'onzz]
That's certainly how it looks.</i>

170
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:57,477
Did you just hear...

171
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,356
<i>It's good to see you both safe.</i>

172
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,566
J'onn, that's a neat trick.

173
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:07,320
Wait, you know J'onn J'onzz
from Supergirl's Earth?

174
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:10,114
Of course I know J'onn. Wait, go back.

175
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:12,158
Supergirl has her own Earth?

176
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,785
Not any more.

177
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:18,122
When we restarted the universe,
our worlds combined,

178
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,792
and only we Paragons
know it was ever any different.

179
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:21,959
[sighs]

180
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:23,753
Okay, sorry, guys,
I'm a little lost here.

181
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,672
Here, this will be faster.

182
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:30,802
Whoa.

183
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:32,845
There was a multi-verse?

184
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,972
It all got destroyed,
there's an evil Batman,

185
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,933
and there's a me that's a super-me?

186
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,644
It'll take him some time
to assimilate to this new paradigm.

187
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:41,562
I have been going from city to city,

188
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:44,440
restoring the memories
of our compatriots as best I can.

189
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,817
And what about Oliver?

190
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:48,695
There's been no sign of him.

191
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:53,324
Hey, where you going?

192
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:54,909
To find my friend.

193
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,707
Oliver!

194
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,337
Oliver!

195
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:20,226
[John] Sara.

196
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,563
No, I need to talk to you guys.

197
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:24,731
We already know.

198
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:27,525
We already know.

199
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:31,154
Martian J'onn came by
and gave us a splitting headache.

200
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:34,741
It all happened, didn't it?

201
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,828
He died twice, Sara.

202
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:40,872
Yeah.

203
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,959
I wasn't there. [sniffs]

204
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,043
Both times.

205
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,964
Both times, I failed him.

206
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:52,175
- Digg--
- I'm so sorry.

207
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,594
It's okay.

208
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,472
I wasn't there.

209
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:01,893
He was my brother.

210
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:04,896
I know.

211
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:06,689
Listen to me.

212
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:09,942
Look, we all... We all died.

213
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:13,780
The entire universe, the multi-verse.

214
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:15,364
Now we're back.

215
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:18,910
That means Oliver, he might be back too.

216
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,124
After the brain dump,

217
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,628
we had Felicity run a global search.

218
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:31,255
I mean, nobody's better
at finding people.

219
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,633
But they've got to be here to be found.

220
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,384
You don't know, look...

221
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,971
When Oliver died,
he became something else.

222
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,390
He called it "the Spectre."

223
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:44,185
And maybe Felicity,
she just can't find him in that form.

224
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,648
Digg, she just
can't find him in this form.

225
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:49,774
Sara.

226
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:52,902
[sighs]

227
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:57,240
Sara, gone is gone.

228
00:10:58,741 --> 00:10:59,867
He's gone.

229
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,292
[gasps]

230
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,063
J'onn.

231
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,774
What are you doing here?
Is something wrong?

232
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,109
Not any more.

233
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:34,777
No thanks to him.

234
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:37,572
Do you know why he's like this?

235
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:40,825
And now, so do you.

236
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,787
-[man] Oliver!
-[woman groans]

237
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:52,086
This is all his fault.

238
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,589
He's the one
who released the Anti-Monitor.

239
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,466
He paid dearly for his misjudgment,

240
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,886
but not as much as some others.

241
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,513
[gasps]

242
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,141
What happened?

243
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,184
Where am I? How did I get here?

244
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:11,772
You nearly damned us
all to hell, Nash Wells!

245
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,149
[sighs]

246
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,442
Well, that's an introduction.

247
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:16,193
Who the hell are you,
and what are you talking about?

248
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:18,571
You need to stay calm.
Your system's still recovering.

249
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:19,572
[Scoffs]

250
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:21,324
You... You need to calm down.

251
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:24,452
I'm not going to stay here and
get lectured by some government suit--

252
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:33,544
God!

253
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:37,715
I'm sorry.

254
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,342
I'm so sorry.

255
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:40,551
And so you should be.

256
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,179
This is all your fault.

257
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,389
It is my fault.

258
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:48,976
But you... You solved it.

259
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,354
You and the others,
you saved the universe.

260
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:52,730
You fixed my mistake.

261
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:55,524
Right?

262
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:57,944
Not entirely.

263
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:03,908
It's true.

264
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,243
[chuckles] We all live
on the same Earth now.

265
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:08,996
Our Earths must have merged when
we helped Oliver reboot the universe.

266
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,331
[chuckles] I can't believe it.

267
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:11,791
What are you guys doing here?

268
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,250
I had to see if it was true.

269
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:17,004
The DEO, CatCo, all of National City
is on this Earth now.

270
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:18,255
Even Argo's up there.

271
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:19,548
We did it!

272
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,008
We saved everyone.

273
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:22,885
Not everyone.

274
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:31,602
Oliver...

275
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:34,105
He didn't make it.

276
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:38,067
Guess we just have to face facts.

277
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:41,195
No, that's not... That's...

278
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,740
Why did he give everyone else
a fresh start, but not himself?

279
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:48,119
Maybe this was the only way, Kara.

280
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,580
Maybe his sacrifice
made all of this possible.

281
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:56,252
Him for us.

282
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,965
[alarm beeps]

283
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:02,591
- What is that?
- We're being attacked.

284
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:03,592
BY Who?

285
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:11,058
You wouldn't believe it if I told you.

286
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,769
[all screaming]

287
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:27,283
<i>Beebe hungry.</i>

288
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:30,077
[roars]

289
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,377
How the hell did Beebo get here?

290
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:39,420
[Rene] Isn't the more pressing question,

291
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:41,589
why is there a giant Beebo
walking down the street?

292
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,382
This wouldn't be the first time.

293
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:45,718
- It's a long story.
- That's right.

294
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:48,095
Wally told us about the time
you guys used those totems

295
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:50,723
to turn yourselves into a giant Beebo
to find a time demon.

296
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,016
I guess it's not a long story.

297
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,350
Could that be what's happening here?

298
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:55,352
-[device chirps]
- Ava, Nate, you there?

299
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,646
I need a twenty on Behrad and his totem.

300
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,231
Sara, are you okay?

301
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,567
Ray called us to tell us
you were on some special mission.

302
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,986
But he was a little flimsy with
the deets, so what's the happs, Caps?

303
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,363
Yeah, we've been busy
saving the multi-verse.

304
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:08,824
You got shanghaied into
another crossover, didn't you?

305
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,160
Uh...

306
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,203
Yeah, kind of.

307
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:13,454
Whoa, whoa. Did they kidnap you?

308
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:15,081
This is a classic crossover move.

309
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:17,416
We tell 'em we're too busy,
they commit a felony.

310
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,586
Guys, Beebo is rampaging
through Star City.

311
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,797
- Does Behrad have his totem?
-[Agent Sharpe] <i>Beebo?</i>

312
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,881
That doesn't make any sense.

313
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:25,382
You would need
all six totems to make that happen,

314
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,134
<i>and Behrad's
definitely still on the ship.</i>

315
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:28,135
All right, I gotta go.

316
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:29,345
Wait, do you need help?

317
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,513
No, stay in DC.

318
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,932
I don't want any more of my people
getting roped into this mess.

319
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,183
Well, here's the thing, um...

320
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:37,019
One of us is kinda of already there.

321
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:39,188
Who?

322
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,274
And who should I make this out to?

323
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:45,402
Doris. I'm such a huge fan, Rebecca...

324
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,446
I mean, what should I call you?

325
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,156
"Rebecca" is fine.

326
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,659
"To Doris.

00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:54,954
"Thanks for the passion, love..."

-[all gasp]

- Why are they running?

00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:03,170
[heavy footsteps]

331
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:08,425
[Beebo chuckles]

332
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:10,970
Furball.

333
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:11,929
Oh, my!

334
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:15,975
-[Beebo chuckles, wails]
-[car horns blare]

335
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:19,728
Oh, man, I can't believe
Nate's gonna miss seeing Beebo.

336
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:20,938
He's gonna be so jealous.

337
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:22,648
[Supergirl] Here he comes.

338
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:23,858
What's the plan?

339
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,235
-[chuckles] Smile, Beebo.
-[Beebo laughs]

340
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,320
-[phone camera clicks]
- What are you--

341
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,864
I'm sorry, you guys
don't want to be in it?

342
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:30,948
Oh, bad timing.

343
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:33,075
Is this seriously happening right now?

344
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,410
Maybe it's a good thing.

345
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,911
Guess we could all use a distraction.

346
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,539
Right, compartmentalize,
focus on the work. Good idea.

347
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:40,291
Guys, uh, Beebo's still on the warpath.

348
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:42,168
Any suggestions on how we take him down?

349
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:44,503
What is that?

350
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:46,463
[John] It's a utility truck. Why?

351
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,341
You guys ready to do a tag-team trip up?

352
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:50,718
Yeah, what do you have in mind?

353
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:53,137
All right, Supergirl, Atom,
keep him contained.

354
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,889
Flash, use those cables to your left.

355
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,015
- All right. Can do.
- Got it.

356
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:02,021
Beebo want cuddles.

357
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:04,607
Is this actually happening?

358
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,358
Is this what
all the crossovers are like?

359
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:07,568
Yes, and not exactly.

360
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:09,653
I'm never letting my child
watch that show again.

361
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:11,071
Done.

362
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,364
All right, now get him moving.

363
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:14,408
-[weapon hums]
- Die, furball!

364
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:15,326
Mick?

365
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,828
That blue bastard
ruined my book signing.

366
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:21,624
<i>[Sara] Okay,
everybody get ready to pull.</i>

367

368
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,002
-[Beebo exclaims]
-[The Flash] All right.

369
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:28,464
- The bigger they are...
- The harder they fall.

370
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,675
-[Beebo exclaims]
- Whoa!

371
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:32,718
[gasps]

372
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:33,928
Thanks, Supergirl.

373
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,555
What the hell?

374
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:39,558
[Beebo giggles]

375
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:41,060
[Ne-Ray] Guys, something's off.

376
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,938
I'm not reading any known elements.
Nothing off the periodic table.

377
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:50,486
I don't think the rules apply
to a 50-foot talking plush toy.

378
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,821
Hey! Hey, Kate's here too...

379
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:54,990
Uh, sorry, what were you saying?

380
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,327
-[Beebo giggles]
- It's unnatural.

381
00:17:58,953 --> 00:17:59,870
Alien?

382
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:01,121
- Hey!
-[The Flash] Or magic?

383
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,958
Sara, don't you and the Legends deal
with that kind of stuff all the time?

384
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,043
Or maybe it's just here
to keep us talking.

385
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:07,544
A diversion.

386
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:09,171
But for what?

387
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,048
I know what I'd do.

388
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:13,133
[alarm wailing]

389
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:17,763
It is finally time
for Sargon the Sorcerer

390
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:20,266
to claim his reward...

391
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,769
Oh, and buy
that beautiful time-share in Bogota.

392
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:29,191
Come on, man. Beebo?

393
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:30,442
Is nothing sacred?

394
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:31,860
[Sara] You know, it's a smart move.

395
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,321
Distracting all the fuzz
with giant fuzz,

396
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:35,781
but someone should have told you...

397
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:39,368
Beebo? He's off-limits.

398
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:46,000
[Beebo] Beebo.

399
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:50,129
-[Supergirl] Oh!
-[laughs] Got him again.

400
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,422
Pugh.

401
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,801
So, how normal was that for everyone?

402
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:57,052
And don't say "very."

403
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,305
Well, with this new Earth,
it just may be.

404
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,848
[scoffs] Dear God, I hope not.

405
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:05,311
What is that?

406
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:06,937
Alcohol.

407
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:13,652
ROW, huh?

408
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,821
We had a Rory once on our team.

409
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,365
- We did.
-[door opens]

410
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,076
What's this?

411
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,330
Was there a memo that went out
on how to infiltrate our secret bunker?

412
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:25,331
Why are you here?

413
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:26,749
I'm here to warn you.

414
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:27,916
You see this?

415
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,002
This gauntlet is primed
to detect anti-matter,

416
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:32,713
of which there has been
a massive surge...

417
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:34,423
here in the Star City area.

418
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,258
Okay, well,
you're about two hours too late.

419
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:38,635
- Already took care of it.
- Did you? Really?

420
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:40,304
My readings say different.

421
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:41,722
This thing ain't over.

422
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:43,057
As a matter of fact...

423
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:44,933
It's just beginning.

424
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,940
[beeps]

425
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:53,400
Something's not right.

426
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:54,443
Is that thing still working?

427
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,862
Yeah, it's working.
I built it myself. It's infallible.

428
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:59,156
Yeah, but you're still
detecting traces of anti-matter.

429
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,533
- Then our fight isn't done, is it?
-[sighs]

430
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,494
No. Or worse...

431
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:05,913
it's starting up all over again.

432
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:14,880
Hey.

433
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,341
How'd you find me?

434
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:20,928
You feel that gust of wind
a few seconds ago?

435
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:24,264
That was me. I did a quick search
of the whole city for you.

436
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,394
When you didn't come back
for the post-Beebo celebration,

437
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:29,478
I got a little worried.

438
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:31,939
Yeah.

439
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:35,984
You see that tree over there?

440
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,694
My sister and I

441
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,863
used to race to the top
when we were little.

442
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:41,698
I'd win every time.

443
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:46,870
I used to think it was
'cause I was a better climber, but...

444
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,832
Now I think Laurel let me win.

445
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,876
She knew I was a sore loser.

446
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,169
[Barry chuckles]

447
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,423
A lot has changed since then.

448
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,843
I was an assassin.

449
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:02,594
[scoffs] I was dead.

450
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:06,056
Now I'm the captain
of a freaking Timeship.

451
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,934
One thing remains the same...

452
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,353
I'm still a sore loser.

453
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,607
I know it's...

454
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:17,693
It's hard,

455
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,528
not having Oliver here with us.

456
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,532
But look at what his sacrifice
made possible.

457
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:27,661
Our world is... It's different.

458
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,165
But at least it's safe.

459
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:32,291
Yeah.

460
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,879
He was just the last tether...

461
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:38,839
To my old life, you know?

462
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:45,512
And he was the only person left
who knew me when I was just...

463
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:48,223
[sighs] Me.

464
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:50,517
With him gone,

465
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:53,437
my connection to this world,
this place...

466
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,148
To that tree...

467
00:21:58,525 --> 00:21:59,693
It's gone.

468
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:05,032
I know what it's like to lose family.

469
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:09,161
My mom, my dad.

470
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,206
Each death felt like...

471
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,958
There was no moving forward.

472
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:18,170
Like, life would never be the same.

473
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:19,087
Yeah.

474
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:23,133
And I was right.
It's not the same, but...

475
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:26,678
Somehow it's okay.

476
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:30,265
Family isn't just the people that
you grew up with,

477
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,767
it's the people you find, the...

478
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:35,270
The ones you love,
the ones who make you crazy...

479
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:37,940
Make you smile.

480
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:43,320
- When did you get so wise?
-[both chuckle]

481
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:47,741
The Legends,

482
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,326
they are my family.

483
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,245
They have been for a while.

484
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,038
I guess I just...

485
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:57,042
I always thought
there would be at least someone

486
00:22:57,251 --> 00:23:00,754
who remembered what I was like
before I got on that boat.

487
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:04,675
[demon shrieks]

488
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:19,314
I thought we got rid
of all those things.

489
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:22,651
<i>[J'onn J'onzz] Barry, Sara,
the Shadow Demons are back.</i>

490
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,820
<i>I believe we are being hunted.</i>

491
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,573
If they're hunting the Paragons,

00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:45,632
[Choi] Sara?

497
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,634
What the hell's going on?

498
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:49,386
You have to come with me. Now.

499
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:55,058
All right, Barry, John, Supergirl
and Batlady are gathering the troops.

500
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:57,394
Those attacks were probably
just the first wave.

501
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:59,813
Assassins sent to pick us off in pairs.

502
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:02,024
How are the Shadow Demons
even still here?

503
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,067
Didn't Oliver destroy the guy
who controls them?

504
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:07,237
Well, not according to the surge in
anti-matter energy I'm reading.

505
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,531
The Anti-Monitor is alive?

506
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:13,243
But you said
Oliver sacrificed himself...

507
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:14,786
To create this new world.

508
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:17,247
Apparently, his sacrifice
didn't kill the Anti-Monitor.

509
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:19,583
Well, then how do we do that?

510
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:23,629
Well, let's just throw him into the sun
and let the bastard burn.

511
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,297
Yeah, let's throw him in the sun,

512
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:28,884
and cause an anti-matter explosion
that obliterates the solar system.

513
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,052
You know what? Let's not do that.

514
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,179
At least he's trying
to offer up a solution

515
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:34,056
instead of being
the cause of the problem.

516
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,974
That's the solution,
blow up the solar system?

517
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:39,019
Okay. Guys, guys,
we're all on the same team, okay?

518
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,188
No, Scrappy's right.

519
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,274
It's my fault we're in this mess.
We gotta fix it.

520
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:45,651
Gotta fix it!

521
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,486
It's just a little tricky.

522
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:49,946
The Anti-Monitor is made of anti-matter,

523
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:53,075
and like its opposite,
it can neither be created nor destroyed.

524
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:53,992
It can only--

525
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:55,744
Change form
and move from place to place.

526
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:57,329
So what if we do just that?

527
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,831
What if we could set off
a chain reaction

528
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,333
that will destabilize his form,

529
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:02,626
compressing his molecules

530
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:05,379
so he's essentially
shrinking for eternity?

531
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:07,464
Is that kind of reaction even possible?

532
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:08,382
Sure is.

533
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:09,966
I did it a bunch of times by accident

534
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,760
when I was developing
my A.T.O.M. Exosuit.

535
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,595
So you think you can keep him
shrinking indefinitely?

536
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,556
Essentially we'd be sending him
to the "Atomverse."

537
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,933
I like to call it the "Microverse."

538
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:19,518
That's better.

539
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:21,561
Possible trademark issues,
but that's better.

540
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:24,272
He could get stuck there
for, like, ever.

541
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,857
[Ray] In theory, it could totally work.

542
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:28,276
But developing a device in time--

543
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,113
Leave that to me, dear leaguers.
Gotta get to S.T.A.R. Labs.

544
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,197
SCRAPPY-

545
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:38,078
Look, if this goes down
anything like it did on Earth-38,

546
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:39,663
then things are gonna get messy.

547
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:42,541
Geek team, get on it.

548
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,668
Mick, go with them. Keep them safe.

549
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,919
The rest of us,

550
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:48,588
[sighs] we'll need to hold back
this incoming army.

[sighs]

552
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,054
This can work, Sara.

553
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:57,806
I... I know it can.

554
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:00,642
That's what we thought
back at the Dawn of Time.

555
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:03,395
Here we are, back at square one.

556
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:06,064
This new Earth isn't square one.

557
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:09,568
It's what Oliver gave up his life
to create.

558
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:11,611
We have to protect it.

559
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:14,781
If we're gonna go down...

560
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:18,243
We go down fighting.

561
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:29,504
All right, listen up!

562
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:32,257
I got a ton of those Shadow things
descending on Gardener Pier.
