1
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:46,375
<i>For organizing this</i>
<i>special program every year, </i>

2
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:49,750
we would like to welcome
the Shaandaliya family from Ladiya,

3
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:53,541
with a huge round of applause.

4
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,833
And a special thanks
to Zed Black Incense Sticks,

5
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,208
for having built this 50 ft. tall
idol of Mother Goddess.

6
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:05,916
<i>The windows of my car are down…</i>

7
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:08,375
Never seen a Sikh tiger before.

8
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:09,958
Oh, please!

9
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:11,958
All Sikhs are tigers.

10
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:13,958
Nonsense!

11
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:17,000
And with a huge round of applause,
please welcome…

12
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:20,166
a true devotee of Mother Goddess,

13
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:22,541
and an amazing performer.

14
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:26,125
My very own…
My <i>personal</i> son.

15
00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:29,125
Mr. Karam Kumar from Mathura.

16
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:30,666
Please give him a big round of applause.

17
00:01:42,375 --> 00:01:44,375
<i>When you hear the rhythm</i>
<i>Start to move</i>

18
00:01:57,625 --> 00:02:00,458
<i>Get on your feet and dance</i>

19
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:03,625
<i>Raise your arms and swing them</i>

<i>Get all your wishes fulfilled today</i>

00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:11,708
<i>Just remember one thing</i>

24
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:15,166
{\an8}<i>Heart's full of mischief</i>
<i>But the body is restless</i>

25
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:18,166
{\an8}<i>Blessed by Her benevolence</i>
<i>Your time is now</i>

{\an8}<i>Dance like Michael</i>

00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:38,916
{\an8}<i>Just dance, dance, dance!</i>

33
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:51,708
{\an8}<i>Let's go!</i>

34
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:58,541
{\an8}<i>Glory to Mother Goddess!</i>

35
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:05,375
{\an8}<i>Glory to Mother Goddess!</i>

36
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:10,625
{\an8}<i>She's made all your wishes come true</i>

37
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:14,291
{\an8}<i>Your actions were always rewarded</i>

38

41

{\an8}<i>Raise your hands, sway that waist</i>
<i>Do a few local steps</i>

00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,375
{\an8}<i>Dance!</i>

48
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:48,750
{\an8}<i>Just dance, dance, dance!</i>

49
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:50,791
{\an8}<i>Hail Mother Goddess!</i>

50
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:52,500
<i>Hail Mother Goddess!</i>

51
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:54,125
<i>Hail Mother Goddess!</i>

52
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:55,791
<i>Hail Mother Goddess!</i>

53
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:57,500
<i>Hail Mother Goddess!</i>

54
00:03:58,333 --> 00:03:59,208
<i>Hail Mother Goddess!</i>

55
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,833
<i>Hail Mother Goddess!</i>

56
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:01,750
<i>Let's go!</i>

57
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:07,875
<i>Glory to Mother Goddess!</i>

58
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:09,125
<i>Hail Mother Goddess!</i>

59
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,291
<i>Glory to Mother Goddess!</i>

60
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:12,750
<i>Glory to…</i>

61
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,541
I came especially on your request
for this program,

62
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:18,458
yet you showed up late.

63
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:21,291
You missed my entry.

64
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:23,083
Listen…

65
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:26,166
I love you.

66
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:28,958
I love you, too.

67
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:31,291
I have four children,

68
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,375
but I am still searching for true love.

69
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:34,750
What are you doing, auntie?

70
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,791
It didn't take me a minute
to understand your hints.

71
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:40,375
Mother Goddess has answered my prayers.

72
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,291
-Let's run away.
-Please, I wasn't hinting at you.

73
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:44,291
Then who?

74
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:45,750
My girlfriend.

75
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:48,791
You cheat!

76
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:51,041
Excuse me, dear.

77
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,208
What was all that about?

78
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:54,666
I don't know.

79
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:55,916
Who was she?

80
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:58,666
I signaled you but she showed up instead.

81
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:00,291
Whatever! Listen.

82
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:02,916
-It's been over a year since we met.
-I know.

83
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,083
<i>Will you talk to my father</i>
<i>about our marriage or not?</i>

84
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:07,416
<i>Sure, I will. </i>

85
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,083
<i>It's not like he's dying. </i>

86
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:10,500
<i>-What?</i>
<i>-I mean he isn't going anywhere. </i>

87
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:11,833
<i>Come here. </i>

88
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:13,333
Someone might see us.

89
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:15,583
-Come on.
<i>-</i>What are you doing, Karam?

90
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:21,458
<i>How did the program suddenly stop?</i>

91
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,541
<i>Radhe…</i>

92
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:35,875
<i>Without you, Krishna's love is incomplete</i>

93
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:38,708
<i>Radhe…</i>

94
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,083
Hello.

95
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:42,458
Wait a second.

96
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:44,125
Are you still sleeping?

97
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:45,791
<i>And I couldn't sleep all night. </i>

98
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:47,375
Were you missing me that desperately?

99
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:48,750
On the contrary, my Dad was missing you.

100
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:50,708
I told Dad everything.

101
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:52,666
When we met,
when we fell in love, et cetera.

102
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,833
What do you mean by <i>et cetera?</i>

103
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:56,250
Don't get on my nerves!

104
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,375
Dad will be arriving at your place soon…

105
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,833
to talk about marriage.

106
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:00,916
To talk about marriage?

107
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:02,500
To talk about marriage?

108
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:04,208
Yes. That's what he said.

109
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:05,291
I don't know all the details.

110
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,125
Now get up and get some snacks.

111
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:10,458
Isn't he one of those strict
orthodox fathers?

112
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:12,000
Shut up. And listen.

113
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:14,583
Make sure you serve him dry fruits
and fruits.

114
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,000
<i>Please don't serve him peanuts. </i>

115
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:18,208
And yes, make sure
the cups you serve tea in are the same.

116
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:19,250
Not different ones.

117
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:21,875
The peanuts look stale.

118
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:28,083
I guess the place hasn't
been maintained for a long time.

119
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,083
The manor seems pretty old.

120
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:32,375
Yes, yes.

121
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:34,958
This place belongs to my ancestors.

122
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:39,208
My son Karam told me several times,

123
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:42,375
that we should move to a bigger place.

124
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:43,500
But I said no.

125
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:45,333
-Why?
-Because we don't have one.

126
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:46,625
Oh!

127
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,250
We'll make him pay today.

128
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:51,083
-He's always making excuses.
-Jagjeet…

129
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:55,666
-Radhe-Radhe.
-Radhe-Radhe.

130
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,583
My money…

131
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,083
-Later. Later.
-When?

132
00:06:58,333 --> 00:06:59,583
We are in no hurry.

133
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:01,458
We want money, we aren't here to give any.

134
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:03,000
You won't get a penny.

135
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:04,416
Pay your old dues first.

136
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,875
I don't want to embarrass you
in front of our guests. Try to understand.

137
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:09,958
Come on, go out.

138
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:12,375
At Pari's behest,

139
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:15,125
I came to see your home.

140
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:17,416
You don't have a job,

141
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,500
nor do you own any property.

142
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:24,208
And your bank balance is non-existent.

143
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:27,083
How could you imagine…

144
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:28,625
that you can have daddy's little girl?

145
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:30,916
Does love mean nothing to you, uncle?

146
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,833
It doesn't.

147
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,958
Think before you speak.
This is not a rapid fire.

148
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:34,875
I see.

149
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:36,458
I should think before I speak.

150
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:38,250
No!

151
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:41,166
Why are the cups different?

152
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,916
It's a cup exhibition, son.

153
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,833
-Listen, mister.
-Get up. Get up.

154
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:46,291
-What is all this? Police?
-Get up! Come on!

155
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:49,000
-What is going on here? Come on.
-Dad, who… who are they?

156
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:50,875
-You can't barge in like this.
-Having a feast, are you?!

157
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,333
NOTICE

158
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:57,708
The 40,00,000 rupees you borrowed from
the bank, using this house as leverage,

159
00:07:57,791 --> 00:08:00,500
clear those dues first
only then can you enter.

160
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:04,416
A scam of 40,00,000 rupees…

161
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,833
You see, mister, the thing is…

162
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,791
The money we borrowed
using this house as leverage,

163
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:12,750
was used to help
the needy during the pandemic.

164
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:13,666
Really?

165
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:14,791
What about the 1,00,000 rupees
you borrowed from me?

166
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:16,333
-Did you give that too?
-Yes.

167
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:19,291
They even borrowed our tea cups.

168
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:20,625
Good God!

169
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:21,875
Have you spoken about dowry?

170
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,500
Don't mention dowry to me.

171
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:24,791
I will hand you over to the police.

172
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:28,625
They said that the money received
in dowry will be used…

173
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,708
to pay off our loans.

174
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:32,666
Ask them. Isn't that what you said?

175
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,833
An alliance? With them?

176
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:36,708
With these homeless people!

177
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:39,208
Uncle, the pandemic hit us hard.

178
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:41,000
Before that,
we didn't have monetary issues.

179
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:43,875
Look, those programs you
do are a service to Mother Goddess.

180
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:44,791
I bow to that.

181
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,666
But is it a job?

182
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:48,041
You call this a job?

183
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:50,833
-Do you think it's easy?
-Yes…

184
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:52,666
From Mohammed Rafi to Mohammed Aziz.

185
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:54,166
From Jagjit Singh to Arijit Singh.

186
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:55,958
No one dared to do these programs.

187
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:59,333
Even internationally,
Justin Bieber, Shakira, and BTS

188
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:01,250
aren't talented enough
to do these special programs.

189
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,708
It's easy to sing a few songs
for a few million.

190
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:06,916
But singing all night, dancing
with the neighborhood females,

191
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,625
with the entire band for only a
handful amount isn't easy, Mr. Srivastav.

192
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:12,750
Not to mention
our slippers get stolen.

193
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:17,166
Only a handful of us are blessed by
Mother Goddess to do these programs.

194
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:22,166
Please… I don't want
such a blessed son-in-law.

195
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,083
Let's go.

196
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:25,875
True love! What I have
for your daughter is true love!

197
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,583
Look! A decent job,

198
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:32,541
twenty to thirty lakh rupees in the bank,

199
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,208
and a place of your own.

200
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,875
If you can achieve all this,

201
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:37,458
then prove yourself in six months.

202
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:38,916
Then we'll talk. Let's go.

203
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:41,166
Is this <i>Roadies?</i>
You're giving me tasks?

204
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,833
I can't find a job
in six months, Mr. Srivastav.

205
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:47,041
You can even find God
if you look properly.

206
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:48,458
Then we'll find God instead.

207
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:49,791
Please, let it be.

208
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:51,666
Judging by your age,

209
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:54,833
God must be looking for you now.

210
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:55,750
Come on.

211
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:58,416
I knew from the stale peanuts
that these people are…

212
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:02,250
-Get lost.
-We're like a family, uncle.

213
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:05,208
-Karam. You guys!
-What do you mean?

214
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:06,125
He's here.

215
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,625
What happened?
Did someone seal your house again?

216
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:09,541
Not at all, son.

217
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,416
We were passing by

218
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:16,333
and thought of staying here
for a couple of weeks.

219
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,250
So that you'll earn some
goodwill and blessings.

220
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,000
-Radhe-Radhe.
-A couple of weeks?

221
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,791
I understand. Come in.

222
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:24,166
Don't you dare bring them inside!

223
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,375
You don't know how lucky they are.

224
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,083
A new hotel has opened up in Agra.

225
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:29,916
And I've been appointed as the
manager of their lounge and bar.

226
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,125
Then take them to that bar!

227
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:34,500
If they come inside, they
will have to do it over my dead body.

228
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:35,416
I hope I have made myself clear!

229
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,041
-Dad, I…
-I won't let them inside.

230
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,583
I won't listen. Not this time.

231
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:41,041
-I won't let them go in!
-They already did.

232
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:46,916
Son, that's how terrifying your father is.

233
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:48,791
Please! They went inside.

234
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:52,583
Missed it.

235
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:54,333
I can't get hold of the queen.

236
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:56,041
Be it in real life or carrom.

237
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:58,041
Not to mention the
25,00,000 rupees I need.

238
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:01,000
Don't worry. I am here for you. See.

239
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,333
Like you're the son of some Sheikh.

240
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,875
Son of a Sheikh?

241
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:07,000
You never told me there are Sheikhs
in Sikhs, as well.

242
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,541
It was a joke.

243
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,291
Oh… that was a joke.

244
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,708
You should mention that beforehand
so that we'll know when to laugh.

245
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:19,166
Shut up.

246
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:21,125
Pari. What brings you here?

247
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:23,625
Dad said you need to have
25,00,000 rupees in your account.

248
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,708
Here you go!

249
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:31,208
Who smudged this painting?

250
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,000
It's called an abstract art.

251
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:37,458
Look.

252
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:40,333
These mangoes have little heads.

253
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:41,416
Are these <i>Dasheri</i> mangoes?

254
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:42,541
Don't eat them.

255
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:46,666
Baby, I did not know
you could paint too.

256
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,000
Baby, you know this.

257
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:51,083
{\an8}Other than writing, dancing,
and singing, I love to paint.

258
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:53,333
Just as popular painters
like M. F. Husain sir.

259
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:56,500
Each horse he paints sells
for around 30,00,000 rupees.

260
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:58,500
So I painted four horses.

261
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,291
We can sell them for
at least 15,00,000 lakh rupees.

262
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:01,333
Oh, really?

263
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:03,291
But you can buy a living-breathing
horse for less than 7,00,000.

264
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:04,666
With sound effects and everything.

265
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,125
-Nonsense.
-What is he saying?

266
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:08,500
{\an8}Don't pay attention to him.

267
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,541
Baby, I appreciate your talent.

268
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:14,916
You don't have to sell your horses.

269
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:16,875
I will find a job.

270
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:21,083
Four hundred for a beer.

271
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:26,458
Is this beer made from grapes,
oranges, or mahua?

272
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,458
-It's free. Gulp it down.
-Right!

273
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:29,750
Cheers, guys.

274
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,125
Repeat it.

275
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,333
What is that?

276
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,458
They are throwing money.

277
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,083
This is nothing.

278
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:40,958
People throw away their gold chains,
rings, scooters… everything.

279
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:44,125
They have no shortage of money,
only of love.

280
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:45,791
Of fondness.

281
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:48,041
Some don't have a wife,
some don't have a girlfriend.

282
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:49,750
And some have both.

283
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:52,208
And some old men only come to watch.

284
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:56,958
See… no energy, but full of lust.

285
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:01,166
Money…

286
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:04,583
I won't become a bar dancer.

287
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:06,000
Not again.

288
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:12,750
Twice, he prayed at Vaishno Devi
and Govardhan to have a daughter.

289
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,125
But he had me instead.

290
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:15,958
Now turn me into a girl.

291
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,541
I am not turning you into a girl
for my personal needs.

292
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:21,041
It's only going to make your life better.

293
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:22,416
Watch it.

294
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:23,916
Okay…

295
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Three thousand rupees per night
and the tip is extra.

296
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,458
You'll make at least
10,000 rupees a day.

297
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,625
And if the customers
like your moves…

298
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,625
which they will!

299
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:38,541
Then you can make around 25,000 per night.

300
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:40,250
And this won't be
the first time you do it.

301
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:43,625
You've been dressing up as Sita, Radha,

302
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:45,666
Draupadi, or Paro since childhood.

303
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,833
I was in a theater group.

304
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:49,291
That was my hobby.

305
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:55,791
Only the lucky ones can turn
their hobby into their profession.

306
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:57,583
Is this why you educated me?

307
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:02,708
I wasn't aware
of the salary package at bars.

308
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:06,541
Otherwise, I wouldn't have
spent a dime on your education.

309
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:08,916
What kind of a father is he?

310
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,833
I should have strangled him
as soon as I was born.

311
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:13,958
I am not dressing up as a girl for anyone.

312
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:16,375
Daughter. Daughter.

313
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:18,708
Karam.

314
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:19,708
My son.

315
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:20,916
Here. Talk.

316
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:22,833
-Who is it?
-Credit card people.

317
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:26,666
We haven't paid their bills
for the past few months.

318
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:29,791
He's called a dozen times, son.
Please talk to him.

319
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,125
<i>Hello. Hello. </i>

320
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:37,000
{\an8}This is Tiger Pandey
speaking from Lena Dena Bank.

321
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:39,333
I called you a dozen times.
Why don't you answer?

322
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:40,625
Tell me. Now.

323
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,416
Hello.

324
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:45,791
I am 36-24-36.

325
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:47,458
Fair complexion,

326
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:48,958
height 5 ft. 9 in.

327
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:51,083
Curvaceous body, semi-attractive.

328
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:54,666
I am his 24-year-old young wife.

329
00:14:55,333 --> 00:15:00,250
Madam, your voice
and figure are awesome.

330
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:04,000
But… why are you telling me this?

331
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:05,333
Because the nation wants to know,

332
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:09,708
even after having so many features,
how can anyone leave his wife?

333
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:11,833
What?
Where did your husband go?

334
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:14,500
I don't know.
He hasn't come home for a week.

335
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:15,875
I wish I was a widow.

336
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,000
I would at least know where my husband is.

337
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:23,500
Look… your husband hasn't paid his
credit card bill for three months.

338
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:25,250
He hasn't paid attention
to me for a week,

339
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:26,208
and you are worried about your bill.

340
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:28,083
I don't understand,
who will pay attention to me?

341
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:31,291
If you don't mind,
you can have all my attention.

342
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:33,291
Even the neighbors can do that,

343
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,875
but who will pay the bill?

344
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:37,083
Don't worry about that.

345
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:39,500
I will get it adjusted.

346
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:42,041
Are you serious?

347
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:44,583
By the way, what's your name?

348
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:45,500
Tiger.

349
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:46,708
Tiger Pandey.

350
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,125
Tiger Pandey.

351
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,208
The name itself gives a peek
into your personality.

352
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:53,625
Long hair.

353
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:56,291
Tall, dark, handsome, wholesome.

354
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,791
I am something like that.

355
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,875
By the way, if you ever need me…

356
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,708
be it during the day,

357
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,291
then do call.

358
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:06,291
I am just a phone call away.

359
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:08,708
Hello. Hello?

360
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:12,291
Bravo, Son. Bravo.

361
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,833
Son.

362
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,500
With your voice,

363
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,583
you can even have
Sri Lanka's loans waived off.

364
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:24,541
I tried many places
but I couldn't get a job.

365
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,291
I'll ask Dad
to join us in a few days.

366
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:29,833
Wait here. I will go get Pari.

367
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:30,791
Come soon.

368
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:41,625
You are not ready yet?

369
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,500
Sometimes the train is on time.
Let's go.

370
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:44,416
Karam.

371
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:46,458
Sell this.

372
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:47,958
Not the paintings!

373
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:49,375
Don't yap about the paintings again.

374
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:50,958
Selling these
won't solve our problem.

375
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:52,375
I know we are facing financial troubles,

376
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:54,625
but I will think of something.
On my own.

377
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:57,166
Karam, these are not paintings,
it's jewelry.

378
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:01,708
It was the only thing you hadn't done,
you started that too?

379
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:05,166
Look, Srivastav's don't
make good goldsmiths.

380
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,500
-Let's go.
-Karam.

381
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:09,291
What?

382
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:10,958
My mom's jewelry is inside this.

383
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:21,583
My mom always said,

384
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,500
"Marry a nice guy,
and wear this jewelry. "

385
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,625
But I know…
if my mother was still around,

386
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,250
between the jewelry and a nice guy,

387
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:34,416
she would have chosen the nice guy.

388
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:39,708
You can sell these
and fulfill my father's conditions.

389
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:42,208
We won't elope.

390
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:46,375
You would sell your mom's
jewelry for our relationship?

391
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:52,250
We middle-class
boys are a class apart.

392
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,166
We always give our best

393
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:55,666
and think on our feet.

394
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:57,666
I'll give it all I have,

395
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:00,750
to fulfill your father's conditions.

396
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:09,208
<i>I know you want it</i>

397
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:14,000
<i>I like it like that</i>

398
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,250
<i>I know you want it</i>

399
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:03,958
Hi.

400
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:05,666
Waiter…

401
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:10,708
Excuse me.

402
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:15,750
How can I help you?

403
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:18,000
Stop boasting your English.

404
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:19,750
Call your boss.

405
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,083
Rascal, it's you.

406
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:23,666
I couldn't recognize you.

407
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:25,541
You would have
if you had looked at my face.

408
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,458
But you said you won't
dress up as a girl.

409
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:29,500
You were adamant.
What changed?

410
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,416
A helpless man has no options.

411
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:35,208
Never have I haggled with the vendor,
for size instead of rates.

412
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:37,291
It paid off.

413
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:40,958
Call your boss.

414
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,333
He'll be here soon.

415
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,041
There he is. That's the owner.

416
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:49,166
Him?

417
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:50,583
Fragile Pappi Lahiri.

418
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,958
Sona Bhai aka Saajan Tiwari.

419
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:55,875
The owner of two kids and four bars.

420
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:57,416
Don't underestimate him.

421
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,833
Drink your milk and off to bed.
Come on.

422
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:00,166
Yeah.

423
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,833
Take it.

424
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:06,125
Sir. Good evening.

425
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:07,375
Good evening.

426
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:08,541
Sir, meet Pooja.

427
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,083
An acquaintance of mine.

428
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:12,708
From all those poor souls
who lost their jobs in the lockdown,

429
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:15,250
-she was affected the most.
-Oh!

430
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:16,875
Her mom passed away when she was a kid,

431
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:18,541
and her father
just passed from behind you.

432
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:20,125
-Where?
-Here.

433
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:21,958
-Hello.
-Oh… hello, hello.

434
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:23,458
She is my daughter.

435
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:26,583
She said your office needs a dance girl,

436
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:27,875
-Yes.
-so I brought her here.

437
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:30,208
You did the right thing, uncle.

438
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:33,000
Well, we have many dancers here.

439
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:36,125
Tell me. What makes her stand apart?

440
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:37,833
They all are foreigners,

441
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:40,083
they have been around
even before the independence.

442
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:42,208
But she is made in India.

443
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,375
A local.
And she sings well.

444
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:47,000
And she's been performing
for All India Radio for years,

445
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:48,541
so she is an amazing performer, as well.

446
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:49,625
Really?

447
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:53,333
Actually, God has packed me
with more features than a smartphone.

448
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:55,541
I can get the customers
to spend the kind of money,

449
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:58,333
which even the bar girls couldn't
make them spend during demonetization.

450
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:01,041
Just give me one chance.

451
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:02,791
Show me.

452
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:04,375
Just… show me.

453
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:10,750
<i>I know you want it</i>

454
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:15,333
<i>I like it like that</i>

455
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:19,833
<i>Waiting at the crossroad of love</i>

456
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:22,125
<i>Feeling so lonely</i>

457
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:24,875
<i>My beloved is across the shore</i>

458
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:29,791
<i>I know you want it</i>

459
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:39,041
<i>Waiting at the crossroad of love</i>

460
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:41,208
<i>Feeling so lonely</i>

461
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:43,750
<i>My beloved is across the shore</i>

462
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:48,375
<i>I sent him several DMs</i>
<i>On vanish mode, my love</i>

463
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:52,666
<i>But he never gives a reply, I gave up</i>

464
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:58,791
<i>Every moment my eyes long for you</i>

465
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:02,375
<i>If you are my sweetheart</i>

466
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:04,708
<i>Come fall in love with me</i>

467
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:07,041
<i>If you are my sweetheart</i>

468
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:09,250
<i>Come fall in love with me</i>

469
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:14,375
<i>If you don't want to come</i>
<i>Then take me across the shore</i>

470
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:18,958
<i>If you are my sweetheart</i>

471
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:21,166
<i>Take me across the shore</i>

472
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,708
<i>Take me across the shore</i>

473
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:26,041
<i>Baby, take me across</i>

474
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:28,958
<i>Take me across the shore</i>

475
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:33,916
<i>I know you want it</i>

476
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:45,333
<i>With you</i>
<i>The mood is always romantic</i>

477
00:22:45,416 --> 00:22:50,000
<i>Every moment feels intoxicated</i>

478
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,375
<i>With you</i>
<i>The mood is always romantic</i>

479
00:22:59,666 --> 00:23:04,291
<i>Every moment feels intoxicated</i>

480
00:23:04,375 --> 00:23:09,083
<i>Love me with no restrictions</i>

481
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:13,708
<i>Cross all boundaries for my love</i>

482
00:23:13,791 --> 00:23:18,625
<i>Let your dormant heart beat faster</i>

483
00:23:18,708 --> 00:23:22,541
<i>Be as restless as I am</i>

484
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:28,125
<i>Even a little distance, seems too far</i>

485
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:29,791
<i>Too far…</i>

486
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:32,416
<i>If you are my sweetheart</i>

487
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,625
<i>Come fall in love with me</i>

488
00:23:34,708 --> 00:23:37,000
<i>If you are my sweetheart</i>

489
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:39,291
<i>Come fall in love with me</i>

490
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:44,208
<i>If you don't want to come</i>
<i>Then take me across the shore</i>

491
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:49,000
<i>Take me across the shore</i>

492
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:54,666
<i>Take me across the shore</i>

493
00:23:57,416 --> 00:23:58,291
Uncle… my hair.

494
00:23:58,708 --> 00:24:00,208
-Uncle, you're ruining my hair.
-Disgusting!

495
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,333
What horrible color is this?

496
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:05,958
I spent 5000 to dye it gold.

497
00:24:06,041 --> 00:24:07,125
Idiots.

498
00:24:07,208 --> 00:24:09,416
You could have
used real gold for 5000.

499
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:11,291
Why have you glued copper to your hair?

500
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:14,583
Henceforth, you'll be following
all the rituals and traditions.

501
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:16,625
Praying five times a day.

502
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,458
Friday prayer.

503
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:20,666
Traditional attire and a cap.

504
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:23,541
-Uncle, why not get us married, as well?
-What?

505
00:24:23,625 --> 00:24:26,333
You always see all the problems
in innocent fellows like us!

506
00:24:26,416 --> 00:24:28,000
No, Uncs. This is wrong.

507
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:31,250
Uncs?
Am I your uncle or a WhatsApp group?

508
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:33,791
If you weren't
the children of my late brother,

509
00:24:33,916 --> 00:24:36,750
you would be rotting
in jail under false implications.

510
00:24:36,833 --> 00:24:38,375
Sakina has dyed her hair, as well. Look.

511
00:24:38,458 --> 00:24:39,833
Why don't you say anything to her?

512
00:24:39,916 --> 00:24:41,541
Sakina will bear children in the future.

513
00:24:41,625 --> 00:24:42,958
Can you?

514
00:24:43,958 --> 00:24:44,791
She is the only one,

515
00:24:45,333 --> 00:24:47,958
upholding the honor of my family.

516
00:24:48,041 --> 00:24:48,958
Slandered.

517
00:24:49,958 --> 00:24:52,250
Father. Your honor has been slandered.

518
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:55,125
Please untie me. Untie me.

519
00:24:55,208 --> 00:24:57,000
Please… Untie me.

520
00:24:57,083 --> 00:24:58,750
Whose funeral is this?
Who died?

521
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:00,416
He died… in your daughter's love.

522
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,416
What are your intentions? Let me go.

523
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,500
What kind of behavior is this?

524
00:25:03,583 --> 00:25:04,416
Who is he?

525
00:25:04,583 --> 00:25:06,583
I think he's a Punjabi.

526
00:25:06,666 --> 00:25:09,500
He doesn't look like a Punjabi, he is one.
But who is he?

527
00:25:09,833 --> 00:25:10,958
He is Smiley.

528
00:25:11,041 --> 00:25:13,125
He is having an affair with Sakina.

529
00:25:14,458 --> 00:25:16,333
Abu Daddy, hello.

530
00:25:17,208 --> 00:25:20,500
Ours is one of the oldest
and most reputed families in Agra.

531
00:25:20,583 --> 00:25:21,416
Yes. I know.

532
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,000
No Tom, Dick, or Harry
can be my son-in-law.

533
00:25:25,083 --> 00:25:28,708
And even after being aware that
Sakina belongs to a different religion,

534
00:25:28,791 --> 00:25:31,625
how dare you fall in love with her?

535
00:25:32,208 --> 00:25:35,166
I didn't know at first
that Sakina is a Muslim.

536
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,375
-What did you think?

537
00:25:36,666 --> 00:25:39,125
Is Sakina a Japanese name?

538
00:25:39,208 --> 00:25:40,833
Not at all. Actually…

539
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,333
Who is loitering in the back?

540
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:44,958
Sakina's grandfather.

541
00:25:45,041 --> 00:25:46,125
Does he ever stop?

542
00:25:46,208 --> 00:25:48,041
Why? Do you need a lift?

543
00:25:48,375 --> 00:25:50,125
-I would if you untie me.
-Quiet.

544
00:25:50,291 --> 00:25:51,541
I have a question.

545
00:25:51,875 --> 00:25:53,958
What is so special about you,

546
00:25:54,041 --> 00:25:55,916
that I would let Sakina marry you?

547
00:25:56,333 --> 00:25:57,500
I will keep her happy.

548
00:25:57,875 --> 00:26:01,125
Even Kapil Sharma's show
makes my daughter happy.

549
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:03,166
Should I let her marry Kapil Sharma then?

550
00:26:03,583 --> 00:26:04,416
Why not?

551
00:26:05,208 --> 00:26:06,708
But always remember…

552
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,958
Kapil shows up only twice a week,

553
00:26:09,041 --> 00:26:10,750
with an entire team and a judge.

554
00:26:11,041 --> 00:26:11,875
I will come alone.

555
00:26:11,958 --> 00:26:14,458
All seven days, twenty-hour hours,
without a break.

556
00:26:14,708 --> 00:26:16,583
So, Sakina, you love me, nah?

557
00:26:21,916 --> 00:26:25,208
Son, we are not the kind of people…

558
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:29,541
who oppose two lovers
on grounds of religion and caste.

559
00:26:31,666 --> 00:26:33,041
I like you.

560
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:35,208
Untie him.

561
00:26:35,791 --> 00:26:36,750
Thank you, Abu Daddy.

562
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:43,083
-You two look marvelous together.
-Thank you.

563
00:26:43,166 --> 00:26:45,875
But, son, there is a problem.

564
00:26:47,333 --> 00:26:48,541
What is it?

565
00:26:48,666 --> 00:26:51,333
Sakina cannot get married,

566
00:26:51,666 --> 00:26:53,666
unless and until Shahrukh gets married.

567
00:26:54,333 --> 00:26:55,208
What are you saying?

568
00:26:55,583 --> 00:26:57,375
He has three children.
He is already married.

569
00:26:58,375 --> 00:27:00,708
Not Shahrukh Khan,
Mohammad Shahrukh.

570
00:27:00,791 --> 00:27:01,625
My elder brother.

571
00:27:01,708 --> 00:27:03,208
Oh… sorry.

572
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,416
So when is my brother-in-law
getting married?

573
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:09,625
Unfortunately, he had
a breakup six months ago.

574
00:27:10,125 --> 00:27:12,125
Since then,
he's been gravely depressed.

575
00:27:12,208 --> 00:27:13,375
Did you take him to a doctor?

576
00:27:13,458 --> 00:27:15,750
He said to take him to a better doctor.

577
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:17,333
You should have
taken a second opinion--

578
00:27:17,416 --> 00:27:18,750
Second, third, fourth…

579
00:27:18,833 --> 00:27:20,000
We took every opinion available.

580
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:21,125
But it was futile!

581
00:27:21,625 --> 00:27:24,666
Whoever helps Shahrukh
to get out of depression,

582
00:27:24,833 --> 00:27:27,041
will be awarded 10,00,000 rupees.

583
00:27:28,833 --> 00:27:30,291
-Ten lakh rupees?
-Ten lakh rupees!

584
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:35,708
Here's an idea.
Auction me away.

585
00:27:35,791 --> 00:27:39,375
Ten lakh rupees at
the snap of a finger, Son.

586
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:41,250
I told them with full confidence,

587
00:27:41,333 --> 00:27:42,958
that you are a successful psychiatrist.

588
00:27:44,041 --> 00:27:47,083
-Amazing.
-Can you even spell psychiatrist?

589
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:48,500
Psychiatrist, my foot!

590
00:27:49,416 --> 00:27:50,666
It starts with "P".

591
00:27:51,166 --> 00:27:53,041
Are you serious?
Not with "C"?

592
00:27:53,708 --> 00:27:55,375
Only one thing starts with "C. "

593
00:27:55,458 --> 00:27:56,291
And that's you.

594
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,916
I am "cute. "

595
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,208
It's not "cute"…
Are you crazy?

596
00:28:00,958 --> 00:28:02,375
I have barely finished high school.

597
00:28:02,458 --> 00:28:04,666
You just complicated everything.
Me, a psychiatrist?

598
00:28:06,416 --> 00:28:07,666
Hello, boy.

599
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,916
Excuse me.

600
00:28:09,166 --> 00:28:11,041
It's a better profile than a bar girl.

601
00:28:11,208 --> 00:28:13,291
-Right, uncle?
-Yes. Yes.

602
00:28:13,375 --> 00:28:16,083
Singing, dancing, grace…

603
00:28:16,375 --> 00:28:18,833
It's all a part of
a psychiatrist's treatment.

604
00:28:19,208 --> 00:28:23,708
What if singing, dancing, and grace…
don't cure his depression?

605
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,291
His sister--

606
00:28:26,666 --> 00:28:30,291
Can only marry me
when her brother gets married.

607
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,583
Do you get it?
His sister's marriage--

608
00:28:32,666 --> 00:28:34,041
Not him… his sister.

609
00:28:34,291 --> 00:28:35,166
Right.

610
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:40,000
Oh my, these people are filthy rich.

611
00:28:41,208 --> 00:28:43,791
Ever seen a pauper's
son slip into depression?

612
00:28:43,875 --> 00:28:44,791
I am one.

613
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,208
Who is that rolling on four wheels?

614
00:28:51,666 --> 00:28:53,458
That's Sakina's rolling grandpa.

615
00:28:54,041 --> 00:28:56,708
For his age,
he rolls more than we do now.

616
00:28:57,583 --> 00:28:59,000
Greetings.

617
00:29:01,208 --> 00:29:02,416
Greetings, Abu Daddy.

618
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,000
-Greetings.
-Greetings.

619
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,583
-Sit.
-This is Pooja.

620
00:29:05,666 --> 00:29:07,583
And that's Sakina's father.

621
00:29:07,666 --> 00:29:09,166
-Hi, Mount Abu.
-Father.

622
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:11,291
By the way, where is the patient?

623
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:14,333
I am Mohammad Shaukiya.
His eldest son.

624
00:29:14,416 --> 00:29:16,541
So you are in depression.

625
00:29:17,208 --> 00:29:20,000
When your height doesn't grow with age,
then a man's bound to be depressed.

626
00:29:20,083 --> 00:29:23,500
No, no, don't judge me
by my personality, lady.

627
00:29:23,583 --> 00:29:25,791
From top to bottom,
I am completely normal.

628
00:29:25,958 --> 00:29:27,041
The patient is inside.

629
00:29:27,416 --> 00:29:28,333
-Sakina.
-Yes?

630
00:29:28,416 --> 00:29:30,166
Take her to Shahrukh's room.

631
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:32,625
No-not…
nein-nyet-none of the above!

632
00:29:32,875 --> 00:29:34,333
Such a complicated no.

633
00:29:34,416 --> 00:29:37,250
I won't go to any room.
The patient will come here.

634
00:29:44,416 --> 00:29:49,083
Look, I won't ask who dumped you.

635
00:29:49,875 --> 00:29:53,166
I just want to ask
how much you loved her.

636
00:29:56,583 --> 00:29:57,416
Okay.

637
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:01,458
Who proposed to whom?

638
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,750
Ever sung a song for her?

639
00:30:07,916 --> 00:30:09,875
Well, I'll sing for you.

640
00:30:10,666 --> 00:30:11,541
Would you like to hear it?

641
00:30:13,791 --> 00:30:15,666
Are you chewing tobacco?

642
00:30:16,875 --> 00:30:18,500
It's not your fault, brother.

643
00:30:18,625 --> 00:30:20,166
Some faces are awful!

644
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,625
Not a single grin.

645
00:30:22,666 --> 00:30:28,250
When you divide it with 10,00,000 rupees,
each tooth is worth 31,250 rupees.

646
00:30:29,041 --> 00:30:31,666
A single grin would fetch
me half a lakh or so.

647
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:32,583
But no.

648
00:30:32,666 --> 00:30:34,916
Forget it.
I'll find someone else.

649
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,875
Will you give this job to someone else?

650
00:30:36,958 --> 00:30:39,041
Not the job. I'll find
someone else for you to marry.

651
00:30:39,125 --> 00:30:40,291
Forget Pari.

652
00:30:40,375 --> 00:30:44,291
{\an8}You don't know about my love for Pari,
and Pooja's charisma.

653
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:45,916
-I see.
-Yes.

654
00:30:46,166 --> 00:30:47,416
If I want,

655
00:30:47,541 --> 00:30:50,750
I can make Abu Salim fall for me,
and become Shahrukh's mom.

656
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,958
Just wait and watch. Forget a grin,
I'll get a broad smile from Shahrukh.

657
00:30:57,041 --> 00:30:58,000
CURSES COME HOME TO ROOST

658
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:11,625
<i>What is this aloofness?</i>

659
00:31:11,708 --> 00:31:13,916
<i>What kind of helplessness is this?</i>

660
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,375
<i>When two birds fall in love</i>

661
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:18,541
<i>Meeting each other is a must</i>

662
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,875
<i>Listen to me, oh tormentor</i>

663
00:31:28,166 --> 00:31:30,333
<i>You have crossed all limits</i>

664
00:31:30,416 --> 00:31:35,041
<i>How long will you keep</i>
<i>Making false promises?</i>

665
00:31:35,125 --> 00:31:37,916
<i>With your photo in my hand</i>

666
00:31:39,916 --> 00:31:42,375
<i>I stay awake at night</i>

667
00:31:42,458 --> 00:31:44,333
<i>I've lost my slumber</i>

668
00:31:44,416 --> 00:31:47,208
<i>Since I've grown wings of love</i>

669
00:31:47,291 --> 00:31:48,833
<i>Wing-Wing-Wing…</i>

670
00:31:48,916 --> 00:31:53,500
<i>For you, my heart</i>
<i>Keeps ringing like a telephone</i>

671
00:31:53,833 --> 00:31:58,333
<i>My heart keeps ringing like a telephone</i>

672
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:03,083
<i>Oh beloved, </i>
<i>It keeps ringing like a telephone</i>

673
00:32:03,375 --> 00:32:07,833
<i>My heart keeps ringing like a telephone</i>

674
00:32:20,166 --> 00:32:24,791
<i>In your love</i>
<i>I spend my nights counting stars</i>

675
00:32:24,875 --> 00:32:29,208
<i>Even with my friends</i>
<i>All I talk about is you</i>

676
00:32:29,291 --> 00:32:34,250
{\an8}<i>You don't know how much I have to lie</i>

677
00:32:34,333 --> 00:32:39,000
<i>Whenever anyone asks</i>
<i>When the wedding is</i>

678
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:41,041
<i>When the wedding is</i>

679
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:44,125
<i>Love is a journey</i>

680
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:48,625
<i>That you can't tread alone</i>

681
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:53,125
<i>Love is a journey</i>

682
00:32:53,208 --> 00:32:55,208
<i>That you can't tread alone</i>

683
00:32:55,291 --> 00:33:00,041
<i>God knows when we'll start dating</i>

684
00:33:01,791 --> 00:33:06,416
<i>For you, my heart</i>
<i>Keeps ringing like a telephone</i>

685
00:33:06,791 --> 00:33:11,333
<i>My heart keeps ringing like a telephone</i>

686
00:33:11,583 --> 00:33:13,958
<i>Be my dream girl</i>

687
00:33:14,041 --> 00:33:15,958
<i>I am searching for your love</i>

688
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:18,625
<i>I might just die</i>

689
00:33:18,708 --> 00:33:20,666
<i>I am searching for your love</i>

690
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,375
<i>Be my dream girl</i>

691
00:33:23,458 --> 00:33:25,416
<i>I am searching for your love</i>

692
00:33:25,666 --> 00:33:28,041
<i>I might just die</i>

693
00:33:28,125 --> 00:33:30,000
<i>I am searching for your love</i>

694
00:33:49,208 --> 00:33:51,625
<i>Be my dream girl</i>

695
00:33:51,708 --> 00:33:53,750
<i>I am searching for your love</i>

696
00:33:53,833 --> 00:33:56,333
<i>I might just die</i>

697
00:33:56,416 --> 00:33:58,458
{\an8}<i>I am searching for your love</i>

698
00:34:00,541 --> 00:34:02,916
No, no.
Abu Daddy, this is impossible.

699
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,166
Why?

700
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,625
She is educated.
She is good-looking.

701
00:34:06,708 --> 00:34:07,875
She is a psychiatrist.

702
00:34:07,958 --> 00:34:10,250
And everyone in
my family likes Pooja.

703
00:34:10,333 --> 00:34:12,416
-Right, Shaukiya.
-Yes, daddy dearest.

704
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,583
So, Pooja will be our daughter-in-law.

705
00:34:15,041 --> 00:34:16,458
But… I…

706
00:34:17,041 --> 00:34:18,041
Daddy dearest.

707
00:34:19,125 --> 00:34:20,833
I am your stepson.

708
00:34:21,166 --> 00:34:24,416
But you're so concerned about me.

709
00:34:24,625 --> 00:34:27,208
Thank you, daddy dearest.
I love you.

710
00:34:27,916 --> 00:34:29,041
You are God…

711
00:34:31,708 --> 00:34:33,541
You've been drinking again!

712
00:34:34,375 --> 00:34:36,875
I've told you countless times
to stop drinking.

713
00:34:37,458 --> 00:34:40,458
This is why you can't get married.

714
00:34:40,708 --> 00:34:44,791
I am talking about Shahrukh
and Pooja's wedding.

715
00:34:47,791 --> 00:34:49,083
But why are you hung up on Pooja?

716
00:34:49,166 --> 00:34:51,208
I'll find someone else for Shahrukh.

717
00:34:51,625 --> 00:34:53,625
Amanpreet, my cousin from Jalandhar.

718
00:34:54,041 --> 00:34:55,416
She recently came out of coma.

719
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,666
It will be a perfect match! Won't it?

720
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:57,791
Just say yes.

721
00:34:57,875 --> 00:34:59,125
-Yes.
-Not at all.

722
00:34:59,291 --> 00:35:01,000
Pooja and only Pooja.

723
00:35:02,708 --> 00:35:04,166
Okay. But…

724
00:35:04,708 --> 00:35:05,541
But what?

725
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,250
Forget it.
You have made up your mind so…

726
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:10,041
But what? Tell me.

727
00:35:15,291 --> 00:35:17,500
I… didn't want to say this,

728
00:35:18,291 --> 00:35:21,000
but as the future
son-in-law of this family,

729
00:35:21,166 --> 00:35:22,291
it's my duty.

730
00:35:24,125 --> 00:35:26,375
Pooja is characterless.

731
00:35:27,541 --> 00:35:28,750
-What?
-Yes.

732
00:35:29,583 --> 00:35:32,458
In fact, she had her
first boyfriend at the age of 18.

733
00:35:32,541 --> 00:35:34,458
Do you know who?
The vegetable vendor.

734
00:35:34,791 --> 00:35:36,375
She would talk grossly
to a grocery seller.

735
00:35:36,458 --> 00:35:38,333
Stop. Stop.

736
00:35:38,416 --> 00:35:39,250
Yes, even the bus conductor--

737
00:35:39,333 --> 00:35:41,416
Stop. I meant, shut up.

738
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,375
I don't want to hear anymore.

739
00:35:42,458 --> 00:35:44,291
Our Shahrukh's just like her.

740
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:46,250
That's why he doesn't get any proposals.

741
00:35:46,791 --> 00:35:47,958
Sir, why don't you understand?

742
00:35:48,041 --> 00:35:50,541
Until Shahrukh doesn't get married,

743
00:35:50,625 --> 00:35:52,708
you cannot marry Sakina.

744
00:35:53,166 --> 00:35:54,291
Get Shahrukh married,

745
00:35:54,375 --> 00:35:56,458
and take Sakina home the next day.
Leave.

746
00:35:56,958 --> 00:35:58,958
-Abu Daddy--
-And another thing.

747
00:35:59,916 --> 00:36:03,833
I'll pay Pooja 50,00,000 rupees
to marry Shahrukh.

748
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:08,958
-Look, please. Don't hit me.
-You dog.

749
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:09,916
Don't hit me…

750
00:36:10,416 --> 00:36:12,375
Do you think I am some charity,
that you're using everywhere?

751
00:36:12,458 --> 00:36:13,333
Auntie, Radhe-Radhe.

752
00:36:13,416 --> 00:36:14,500
-Where are you going?
-Don't hit…

753
00:36:14,583 --> 00:36:15,416
Listen to me.

754
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,458
Don't hit me.

755
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:18,833
-Please, listen to me.
-Stop, you idiot! Go jump in the river.

756
00:36:18,916 --> 00:36:20,250
-I am falling. I am falling…
-Go jump.

757
00:36:20,333 --> 00:36:22,125
I am not some sanitizer
that you're giving to everyone.

758
00:36:22,458 --> 00:36:23,291
Now tell me.

759
00:36:23,375 --> 00:36:26,000
They are paying you 50,00,000 rupees
for this marriage.

760
00:36:26,208 --> 00:36:27,166
Fifty lakh rupees!

761
00:36:27,791 --> 00:36:29,125
You'll get fresh notes!

762
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,833
Fresh notes?

763
00:36:31,166 --> 00:36:33,958
What about the performance
he'll demand in exchange at night?

764
00:36:35,208 --> 00:36:36,708
-Yes, I didn't think about that.
-Exactly.

765
00:36:37,125 --> 00:36:39,083
Just manage for one night.

766
00:36:39,166 --> 00:36:41,083
I will marry Sakina the next day.

767
00:36:41,333 --> 00:36:42,583
Then you can run away.

768
00:36:42,666 --> 00:36:44,916
We'll say that she was a fraud.

769
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,041
Are you dumb?
What will Pari think if she finds out?

770
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:49,125
Who is going to tell her?

771
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,583
You can become a bar girl
for your selfish means,

772
00:36:51,666 --> 00:36:54,500
but can't help your dear friend out.

773
00:36:55,625 --> 00:36:58,458
Son… it's a good deal.

774
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:00,416
-Very good deal.
-I see.

775
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,333
Then you marry him.

776
00:37:01,625 --> 00:37:02,500
Me?

777
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,458
A couple of years ago
I would have taken up the offer.

778
00:37:06,541 --> 00:37:08,750
Such a big amount in a single night.

779
00:37:08,833 --> 00:37:10,541
How much for a single night?

780
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:15,125
Who is paying?

781
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Pari, what brings you here?

782
00:37:18,083 --> 00:37:20,708
Dad wanted an update
on Karam's job search.

783
00:37:20,875 --> 00:37:22,208
So I thought I'd ask.

784
00:37:22,291 --> 00:37:24,041
-Radhe-Radhe, uncle.
-Radhe-Radhe.

785
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:28,083
Please make him understand.
They are paying handsomely for one night.

786
00:37:28,791 --> 00:37:31,625
I mean, to sing.
But he doesn't agree.

787
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,916
Why?
Why aren't you singing?

788
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,541
Singing is not the problem.

789
00:37:35,708 --> 00:37:39,250
What scares me is
if they ask for a performance!

790
00:37:39,333 --> 00:37:40,916
You can charge extra for that?

791
00:37:42,041 --> 00:37:42,875
Right, uncle?

792
00:37:42,958 --> 00:37:44,250
Bravo, child.

793
00:37:44,333 --> 00:37:46,500
Child, we are very proud

794
00:37:46,583 --> 00:37:49,000
that you're coming to my home
as a daughter-in-law.

795
00:37:49,916 --> 00:37:50,916
Did you forget, Karam?

796
00:37:51,458 --> 00:37:54,541
The faster you make money,
the sooner I'll be your bride.

797
00:38:01,875 --> 00:38:04,083
Dad, I always knew,

798
00:38:04,833 --> 00:38:06,291
I would be a bride when I grow up.

799
00:38:07,083 --> 00:38:10,500
We've taken money from so many people,
that now I've to take wedding vows.

800
00:38:10,583 --> 00:38:11,791
Only because of him.

801
00:38:12,583 --> 00:38:13,500
My pleasure, brother.

802
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:14,750
Pleasure, my foot!

803
00:38:14,833 --> 00:38:16,083
Don't be mad.

804
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,833
What you're doing for me,
even my brother wouldn't do.

805
00:38:20,208 --> 00:38:22,708
I don't know how
I am going to pay off this favor.

806
00:38:22,791 --> 00:38:24,458
Don't take my skirt off instead.

807
00:38:24,541 --> 00:38:25,541
-Back off!
-Sorry.

808
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:26,666
I have a question.

809
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:29,333
What was the need for a lavish wedding?

810
00:38:29,625 --> 00:38:31,291
We could have had a small wedding.

811
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:32,541
On top of that, such a huge resort!

812
00:38:33,416 --> 00:38:34,500
The resort isn't huge,

813
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,250
you've been a pauper for ages.

814
00:38:36,333 --> 00:38:37,916
This is how the rich roll.

815
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,041
They pay more for less.

816
00:38:40,125 --> 00:38:41,458
And paupers like us…

817
00:38:41,958 --> 00:38:44,625
We keep holding on
to whatever little we have.

818
00:38:46,208 --> 00:38:47,041
Who is it?

819
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:48,083
Enemy.

820
00:38:48,166 --> 00:38:49,208
Blouse, dress…

821
00:38:49,291 --> 00:38:51,416
-Go inside. Scarf!
-Wait.

822
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,000
-Your dress.
-Arrange the oranges properly.

823
00:38:53,083 --> 00:38:55,250
-Don't open it until I say so.
-Yes.

824
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,166
Should I?

825
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,708
-Open it now.
-Yes!

826
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:22,208
Is sister-in-law Pooja ready?

827
00:39:23,125 --> 00:39:24,583
Yes… she is arranging her oranges.

828
00:39:24,791 --> 00:39:25,875
Oranges?

829
00:39:26,541 --> 00:39:28,416
Interlude!
I meant, the interlude of the song.

830
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,291
-She likes to sing.
-I see.

831
00:39:30,375 --> 00:39:32,833
She wants to sing for
Shahrukh on their first night.

832
00:39:32,916 --> 00:39:34,625
Oh my, God. So romantic.

833
00:39:35,041 --> 00:39:36,166
Let me introduce her.

834
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:38,500
She is my aunt Jumani.

835
00:39:38,708 --> 00:39:39,541
Greetings.

836
00:39:39,625 --> 00:39:40,500
Auntie?

837
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:42,708
I don't believe you.

838
00:39:44,166 --> 00:39:45,208
She's your younger sister.

839
00:39:46,041 --> 00:39:49,333
And even if she's the eldest, then she
might only be by a couple of minutes.

840
00:39:50,166 --> 00:39:52,083
You are being modest.

841
00:39:52,833 --> 00:39:54,625
I am like her elder sister.

842
00:39:55,291 --> 00:39:57,000
How soon will
sister-in-law Pooja be ready?

843
00:39:58,125 --> 00:40:00,750
Well… she's ready… finally.

844
00:40:04,083 --> 00:40:05,875
Hey. Did you ask the band to stop playing?

845
00:40:05,958 --> 00:40:07,916
You're lucky I didn't stop this wedding.

846
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,333
You knew I love Pooja,

847
00:40:10,416 --> 00:40:14,333
yet you're getting
Pooja married to that Shahrukh.

848
00:40:14,583 --> 00:40:15,791
You've been drinking again.

849
00:40:15,875 --> 00:40:17,083
I have. And I am proud of it.

850
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,375
Always remember,
this is why no one likes you.

851
00:40:23,458 --> 00:40:25,750
Pooja likes me because of this.

852
00:40:25,833 --> 00:40:28,291
In Pooja's eyes, I've seen…

853
00:40:28,375 --> 00:40:29,666
Lust. You saw lust.

854
00:40:30,833 --> 00:40:31,666
Gleam.

855
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:35,958
If you ever utter
Pooja's name again,

856
00:40:36,041 --> 00:40:37,666
I will kill you.

857
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:39,666
You bottle-less cork.

858
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:40,583
Get out.

859
00:40:41,333 --> 00:40:42,458
Dearest, Sister-in-law.

860
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:47,000
Scratch me, will you?

861
00:40:47,083 --> 00:40:48,208
Scratch your own.

862
00:40:48,291 --> 00:40:49,375
My back needs scratching.

863
00:40:49,708 --> 00:40:51,791
-I see.
-Go lower. Lower.

864
00:40:53,166 --> 00:40:54,625
Lower. Yes, there.

865
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,791
My beard will grow back
in two hours. Arrange for a razor.

866
00:40:58,875 --> 00:41:00,708
Asking a Sikh for a razor.
Aren't you ashamed?

867
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:03,833
He is touching her in illegal areas.

868
00:41:04,041 --> 00:41:05,458
Let's go see his legal.

869
00:41:17,375 --> 00:41:18,250
What are you doing?

870
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,375
Suspecting…

871
00:41:19,541 --> 00:41:20,416
Your boyfriend.

872
00:41:21,166 --> 00:41:22,208
While you're busy taking selfies,

873
00:41:22,291 --> 00:41:24,208
your boyfriend is
tuning in to two channels at a time.

874
00:41:24,583 --> 00:41:26,416
We saw him… with sister-in-law Pooja.

875
00:41:26,666 --> 00:41:28,666
Your personal kitchen
is also doing charity outside.

876
00:41:29,625 --> 00:41:31,250
They are friends.

877
00:41:32,708 --> 00:41:34,791
Wait a minute,
I know what's going on.

878
00:41:35,166 --> 00:41:37,541
Dad approved my love marriage,

879
00:41:37,708 --> 00:41:40,000
that's why you two are jealous.

880
00:41:40,625 --> 00:41:42,041
With the grace of God,

881
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:43,750
the wedding is happening
at a very auspicious moment.

882
00:41:43,833 --> 00:41:45,916
This relationship will
last for a lifetime.

883
00:41:46,083 --> 00:41:46,916
Listen, sir.

884
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,958
Don't try to be an astrologer,
when we paid you to be a priest.

885
00:41:49,041 --> 00:41:50,375
Please begin with the wedding.

886
00:41:50,458 --> 00:41:51,541
Yes, I will.

887
00:41:52,625 --> 00:41:55,791
Do you accept this holy matrimony
with Abu Salim's son Shahrukh?

888
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,875
Oh…

889
00:42:04,458 --> 00:42:06,583
Shahrukh Weds Pooja.

890
00:42:07,333 --> 00:42:08,208
What a coincidence!

891
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:10,875
There is a Pooja here, as well.

892
00:42:15,458 --> 00:42:16,833
Do you accept or not?

893
00:42:16,916 --> 00:42:18,375
I do. I do. I do.

894
00:42:18,458 --> 00:42:19,291
Great.

895
00:42:19,541 --> 00:42:20,416
And you?

896
00:42:27,291 --> 00:42:28,125
I do.

897
00:42:29,541 --> 00:42:31,333
Marvelous! Fantastic!

898
00:42:33,791 --> 00:42:37,708
So, angels have descended
from heaven here.

899
00:42:38,541 --> 00:42:40,333
-Hello.
-Shut up.

900
00:42:41,416 --> 00:42:42,750
What is he doing here?

901
00:42:43,833 --> 00:42:45,666
I don't know.
I didn't invite him.

902
00:42:46,083 --> 00:42:49,666
Buddy, I don't feel too well.
I'll go grab a bite.

903
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:51,541
-Wait!
-I'll be right back.

904
00:42:52,125 --> 00:42:53,625
Everyone has deserted me.

905
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:54,875
Grandpa.

906
00:42:55,875 --> 00:42:57,333
Drop me off at the salad counter.

907
00:42:57,583 --> 00:42:58,750
-What are you doing?
-Drive faster.

908
00:43:01,666 --> 00:43:02,833
Congratulations!

909
00:43:02,916 --> 00:43:04,666
Who invited you here?
Get out.

910
00:43:04,875 --> 00:43:07,625
I wish you hadn't invited me
to your sister's wedding,

911
00:43:08,208 --> 00:43:09,625
then my life wouldn't be ruined.

912
00:43:09,708 --> 00:43:10,541
What?

913
00:43:10,625 --> 00:43:11,541
I have a question.

914
00:43:11,625 --> 00:43:13,833
Your son isn't even fit to be cursed,

915
00:43:14,083 --> 00:43:15,208
who gave him their daughter?

916
00:43:15,291 --> 00:43:17,625
Just like we gave you our sister,
without cursing you.

917
00:43:17,708 --> 00:43:19,416
Wish you had cursed me instead.

918
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:20,583
That would have been better
than giving me your sister.

919
00:43:21,583 --> 00:43:22,750
Throw him out, Brother.

920
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:24,083
You don't get to see the bride.
Get lost.

921
00:43:24,166 --> 00:43:25,250
I see.

922
00:43:26,041 --> 00:43:27,666
Divorce papers are ready.

923
00:43:28,458 --> 00:43:31,333
My lawyer will come tomorrow,
and throw it in your face.

924
00:43:31,416 --> 00:43:33,500
Send it over. I will sign it.

925
00:43:33,583 --> 00:43:34,708
-And another thing.
-What?

926
00:43:34,791 --> 00:43:36,750
Do you have an
ice cream counter or not?

927
00:43:36,958 --> 00:43:37,791
Get out.

928
00:43:38,958 --> 00:43:40,541
Be careful on the stairs.

929
00:43:41,291 --> 00:43:43,000
Come…

930
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,166
This is how it goes…

931
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,041
Dad.

932
00:43:53,916 --> 00:43:55,791
How will I live without you?

933
00:43:55,875 --> 00:43:58,041
Even I cannot live without you.

934
00:43:59,708 --> 00:44:01,708
Respected Nawab sir,

935
00:44:01,875 --> 00:44:03,208
if you don't mind…

936
00:44:03,291 --> 00:44:05,750
can I accompany her for one night?

937
00:44:06,333 --> 00:44:09,125
My daughter has never
gone anywhere alone.

938
00:44:09,458 --> 00:44:10,958
I am worried about her.

939
00:44:11,041 --> 00:44:12,333
Is she going to the border?

940
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:14,583
Nawab sir, this is nothing
short of going on a border.

941
00:44:15,291 --> 00:44:16,625
Please let him come, Abu Daddy.

942
00:44:16,708 --> 00:44:18,250
It's only for one night.

943
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:20,416
Fine. Let's go.

944
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:30,041
They're here.

945
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:37,833
Tomorrow morning, we disappear
as soon as Smiley shows up.

946
00:44:38,125 --> 00:44:41,791
Before that, I will make them
pay the 50,00,000 rupees.

947
00:44:42,041 --> 00:44:43,416
They might go back
on their words later.

948
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:44,375
That's right.

949
00:44:45,083 --> 00:44:45,958
Pari's calling.

950
00:44:46,416 --> 00:44:47,708
-Talk to her.
-Give it.

951
00:44:48,416 --> 00:44:49,791
Honey, where are you?

952
00:44:49,875 --> 00:44:52,458
Not <i>honey. </i> This is <i>honey's</i> dad.

953
00:44:54,333 --> 00:44:55,708
Radhe-Radhe, uncle.

954
00:44:55,916 --> 00:44:56,833
Where is Karam?

955
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,625
Pray to the Gods.

956
00:45:00,291 --> 00:45:04,750
{\an8}She is gearing up for the most
dangerous performance of her life.

957
00:45:05,291 --> 00:45:06,125
She?

958
00:45:06,541 --> 00:45:08,250
The artist who is performing,

959
00:45:08,333 --> 00:45:12,041
Karam is going to sing a duet with her.

960
00:45:12,833 --> 00:45:14,000
Have fun, Sister-in-law.

961
00:45:14,625 --> 00:45:16,625
Brother Shahrukh is waiting for you.

962
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:20,916
Hrithik's posters in Shahrukh's room.

963
00:45:21,208 --> 00:45:22,166
Weird.

964
00:45:33,291 --> 00:45:34,125
Who is it?

965
00:45:34,458 --> 00:45:35,333
A bad omen.

966
00:45:39,083 --> 00:45:40,583
Sorry, I'll get another one.

967
00:45:40,666 --> 00:45:41,583
No need.

968
00:45:43,291 --> 00:45:44,458
I took a pill.

969
00:45:44,708 --> 00:45:45,625
Pill?

970
00:45:46,458 --> 00:45:47,416
Which pill?

971
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:49,791
Sleeping pill. Why?

972
00:45:50,208 --> 00:45:51,208
Good God!

973
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,208
Tonight is our first night.

974
00:45:53,875 --> 00:45:55,208
Are you not going
to do anything funny?

975
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:59,375
Aren't you happy with this marriage?

976
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:12,333
A huge place like this and
there's a freaking lizard in the bathroom!

977
00:46:15,333 --> 00:46:16,791
<i>Hello. Can you hear me?</i>

978
00:46:16,875 --> 00:46:18,000
Wait a second.

979
00:46:18,083 --> 00:46:19,083
This is urgent.

980
00:46:26,458 --> 00:46:28,833
Who is watering the plants at this hour?

981
00:46:29,666 --> 00:46:31,375
He's out of his mind.

982
00:46:31,916 --> 00:46:34,208
How was your first night?

983
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:36,583
Don't be late in the morning.

984
00:46:36,666 --> 00:46:39,291
Don't worry.
I'll be there before you know it.

985
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:53,041
Daughter-in-law? Boy?

986
00:47:00,125 --> 00:47:01,541
Grandpa.

987
00:47:01,791 --> 00:47:03,583
Why did you leave us, Dad?

988
00:47:04,583 --> 00:47:06,500
You weren't that old!

989
00:47:06,583 --> 00:47:08,000
He was 105 years old.

990
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:11,000
He was born at a time

991
00:47:11,416 --> 00:47:13,750
when the army fought with their hands.

992
00:47:13,833 --> 00:47:14,708
This is unfair.

993
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:16,666
Absolutely unfair.

994
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:18,750
Radhe-Radhe.

995
00:47:20,791 --> 00:47:23,791
Nawab sir,
why didn't you tell me this earlier?

996
00:47:24,083 --> 00:47:25,708
We found out in the morning.

997
00:47:25,916 --> 00:47:27,166
Who told you?

998
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:29,625
I spent the entire night
counting notes with these hands.

999
00:47:29,708 --> 00:47:32,000
They turned out
to be twenty-five instead of fifty.

1000
00:47:32,083 --> 00:47:33,500
Are you out of your mind?

1001
00:47:34,541 --> 00:47:37,416
My grandpa is dead,
and you're crying over money.

1002
00:47:37,916 --> 00:47:40,625
He was alive and well till last night.

1003
00:47:40,916 --> 00:47:42,000
When did this happen?

1004
00:47:42,166 --> 00:47:44,333
You want the balance amount,
don't you? Come with me.

1005
00:47:44,416 --> 00:47:45,666
You will pay me before the funeral, right?

1006
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:46,791
I have such an uncouth father-in-law!

1007
00:47:46,875 --> 00:47:49,541
It will make his soul rest in peace, dear…

1008
00:47:55,125 --> 00:47:56,791
What happened to Grandpa?

1009
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,416
He was going to the lavatory.

1010
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,166
Which laboratory?

1011
00:48:00,333 --> 00:48:01,833
Not the laboratory, dear.

1012
00:48:02,333 --> 00:48:04,666
He was going to the bathroom.
It was urgent.

1013
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:06,958
So urgent that he died.

1014
00:48:07,333 --> 00:48:08,875
Play the serpent tune.

1015
00:48:19,625 --> 00:48:20,625
Stop!

1016
00:48:22,125 --> 00:48:23,625
What will it take to make you stop?
The serpent gem?

1017
00:48:23,916 --> 00:48:24,875
Sorry, Abu Daddy.

1018
00:48:25,666 --> 00:48:26,500
Here you go.

1019
00:48:27,333 --> 00:48:28,583
Smiley weds Sakina.

1020
00:48:28,791 --> 00:48:31,500
Today 7 p. m. onwards, Milan Vatika Garden.

1021
00:48:31,583 --> 00:48:33,125
My entire family has already reached.

1022
00:48:33,291 --> 00:48:35,416
Please don't be late.
This is my first wedding.

1023
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:36,333
You fool.

1024
00:48:37,583 --> 00:48:39,291
My father is dead,

1025
00:48:39,375 --> 00:48:40,500
and you are worried about your wedding.

1026
00:48:43,416 --> 00:48:45,458
Sorry, I didn't notice amid my excitement.

1027
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:47,083
When did it happen?

1028
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:48,125
Today, in the morning.

1029
00:48:48,833 --> 00:48:52,458
Look… when someone dies in the family,

1030
00:48:52,541 --> 00:48:54,875
we cannot conduct any
auspicious ceremony for six months.

1031
00:48:54,958 --> 00:48:56,625
What? How many months?

1032
00:48:56,708 --> 00:48:57,750
Six months.

1033
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:06,041
What is wrong with her?

1034
00:49:06,708 --> 00:49:09,458
-Oh, my God! Good Lord!
-What's this?

1035
00:49:09,541 --> 00:49:12,791
What happened to grandpa? Why? Where?

1036
00:49:12,875 --> 00:49:14,125
Why did he have to die now?

1037
00:49:14,208 --> 00:49:15,541
Happy realization!

1038
00:49:15,625 --> 00:49:16,458
You didn't cry at first.

1039
00:49:16,791 --> 00:49:19,833
You don't know how many
lives his death has ruined.

1040
00:49:20,125 --> 00:49:20,958
And Abu Daddy,

1041
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:24,291
I got married yesterday,
and today he's dead.

1042
00:49:24,875 --> 00:49:26,208
I think I'm the unlucky one.

1043
00:49:26,541 --> 00:49:28,125
I don't deserve to stay here.

1044
00:49:28,208 --> 00:49:29,583
-I am leaving--
-Wait.

1045
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:31,166
This is not your fault.

1046
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:33,583
-It is my fault.
-Dearest, Sister-in-law.

1047
00:49:33,666 --> 00:49:35,750
Take a look at this before you leave.

1048
00:49:35,833 --> 00:49:39,708
See what Grandpa wrote
on the wall before he died.

1049
00:49:40,458 --> 00:49:44,291
DAUGHTER-IN-LAW… BOY.

1050
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,416
I am sorry. I was going to tell you--

1051
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:59,791
His last wish was for his
daughter-in-law to give birth to a boy.

1052
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:02,750
Or he could have written girl, as well.

1053
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:04,458
Yes.

1054
00:50:05,375 --> 00:50:06,750
This is what I wanted to say.

1055
00:50:07,125 --> 00:50:09,541
A family where children
are born to fulfill

1056
00:50:09,625 --> 00:50:12,291
the elder's last wish
and not by the consent of parents,

1057
00:50:12,375 --> 00:50:13,833
I cannot stay there at all.

1058
00:50:13,916 --> 00:50:14,750
Wait. Stop.

1059
00:50:14,833 --> 00:50:16,750
{\an8}-Dearest, Sister-in-law, stop!
-Don't stop me. I am leaving.

1060
00:50:16,833 --> 00:50:18,541
But I can't go.

1061
00:50:18,625 --> 00:50:20,875
I don't want to leave Grandpa.

1062
00:50:21,041 --> 00:50:23,833
-Grandpa.
-Grandpa, why did you leave us?

1063
00:50:24,833 --> 00:50:25,833
Radhe-Radhe.

1064
00:50:25,958 --> 00:50:27,583
-Who are you?
-I am the lawyer. Pari.

1065
00:50:27,875 --> 00:50:31,000
Dad, Grandpa hasn't
even reached heaven yet,

1066
00:50:31,083 --> 00:50:33,166
and you already called
a lawyer for the will!

1067
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:34,375
I get the Noida plot.

1068
00:50:34,458 --> 00:50:36,041
I am Mr. Saajan's lawyer.

1069
00:50:36,333 --> 00:50:38,166
-He sent these divorce papers.
-Divorce!

1070
00:50:38,291 --> 00:50:39,708
Give me. I'll sign them right away.

1071
00:50:39,791 --> 00:50:41,208
What is going on here?

1072
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:44,250
Be it in marriage, children,
or divorce you're always in a hurry.

1073
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:45,333
What's the hurry?

1074
00:50:45,708 --> 00:50:47,500
We'll have it sent over.

1075
00:50:49,375 --> 00:50:50,375
Did someone pass away?

1076
00:50:50,875 --> 00:50:53,875
No. Grandpa likes to play dead.

1077
00:50:56,208 --> 00:50:58,083
I cannot keep Pari in the dark anymore.

1078
00:50:59,333 --> 00:51:01,458
I will tell her the truth right now.

1079
00:51:02,708 --> 00:51:05,291
Man, the things I've to do for love,
friendship, and family!

1080
00:51:13,958 --> 00:51:14,958
Where have you been?

1081
00:51:15,291 --> 00:51:16,583
I called six times.

1082
00:51:17,208 --> 00:51:18,375
And why have you tied this handkerchief?

1083
00:51:18,458 --> 00:51:20,875
So that your father
doesn't see me. Let's go…

1084
00:51:22,916 --> 00:51:23,958
You were going to tell me something today.

1085
00:51:24,041 --> 00:51:24,875
-Me.
-Yes.

1086
00:51:24,958 --> 00:51:27,041
Oh, yes. I got a job.

1087
00:51:27,291 --> 00:51:28,416
I've reacquired my house.

1088
00:51:28,583 --> 00:51:29,625
-I see.
-Yes.

1089
00:51:30,625 --> 00:51:32,666
How did you make so much money so soon?

1090
00:51:33,166 --> 00:51:34,958
It's an easy and fun job.

1091
00:51:35,375 --> 00:51:37,500
Satisfy the customer, and get paid.

1092
00:51:37,583 --> 00:51:39,083
Sometimes they even give a bonus.

1093
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:42,125
What do you think?

1094
00:51:44,125 --> 00:51:45,666
They must pay you extra for a kiss?

1095
00:51:46,166 --> 00:51:47,208
Extra money for hugs…

1096
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:49,625
-and other things.
-What do you mean?

1097
00:51:49,708 --> 00:51:52,291
Meeting with that auntie
during the program.

1098
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:53,791
-And now this.
-What are you talking about?

1099
00:51:53,875 --> 00:51:55,416
Dad told you to earn money,

1100
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:56,500
not to do this.

1101
00:51:56,583 --> 00:51:57,500
What do you mean?

1102
00:51:57,583 --> 00:51:59,666
Don't call or text me again.

1103
00:51:59,833 --> 00:52:02,041
-I hate you.
-Hate you? Hate you?

1104
00:52:02,125 --> 00:52:03,250
That's all you ever say!

1105
00:52:03,333 --> 00:52:05,458
Listen, you blessed son-in-law.

1106
00:52:05,958 --> 00:52:08,291
-Hello, uncle.
-It's okay.

1107
00:52:09,416 --> 00:52:11,791
This is not the kissing booth.

1108
00:52:11,875 --> 00:52:12,958
What do you mean?

1109
00:52:13,291 --> 00:52:15,250
Have you smeared tomato sauce
on your lips?

1110
00:52:17,583 --> 00:52:19,041
Disgusting.

1111
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:27,666
I am not dressing up as Pooja.

1112
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:29,291
First of all, she's my girlfriend.
On top of that, she's a lawyer.

1113
00:52:29,375 --> 00:52:31,708
She always doubts me.
She isn't answering my calls.

1114
00:52:31,791 --> 00:52:32,708
I cannot do this.

1115
00:52:33,041 --> 00:52:34,125
Are you out of your mind?

1116
00:52:34,208 --> 00:52:37,166
We'll never get the remaining
25,00,000 rupees.

1117
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:38,458
Forget that!

1118
00:52:38,541 --> 00:52:40,541
What if they have us arrested for fraud?

1119
00:52:40,625 --> 00:52:43,000
-It's only a matter of a few nights.
-Why couldn't you say day?

1120
00:52:43,083 --> 00:52:43,916
Yes…

1121
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Those who want to do it,
don't care whether it's day or night.

1122
00:52:47,041 --> 00:52:50,208
<i>Radhe…</i>

1123
00:52:50,291 --> 00:52:51,125
<i>Hello. </i>

1124
00:52:52,041 --> 00:52:55,000
Hello. This is your Tiger speaking.

1125
00:52:55,375 --> 00:52:57,416
-Tell me.
<i>-I called to say, </i>

1126
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:01,750
I paid… your credit card bill.

1127
00:53:02,416 --> 00:53:04,166
You seem pretty eager.

1128
00:53:04,291 --> 00:53:05,250
Why did you pay it?

1129
00:53:05,583 --> 00:53:07,625
Well… since I couldn't
pay any attention to you,

1130
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,250
I paid your bill.

1131
00:53:09,875 --> 00:53:10,791
Brother, your food.

1132
00:53:10,875 --> 00:53:12,458
<i>Yes, you eat it. </i>

1133
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:15,458
My mother's eye needed surgery.

1134
00:53:15,541 --> 00:53:17,041
I had saved money for her.

1135
00:53:17,125 --> 00:53:18,750
So I took some from that.

1136
00:53:20,041 --> 00:53:23,291
Oh… you screwed your
mom's screwed-up eye.

1137
00:53:23,375 --> 00:53:25,791
Mom can still see properly with one eye.

1138
00:53:25,875 --> 00:53:28,708
So… I can get the surgery done later.

1139
00:53:28,875 --> 00:53:31,541
And anyway, you are not different from me.

1140
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:36,541
To be honest,
I am desperate to meet you.

1141
00:53:37,625 --> 00:53:38,708
I can't meet you.

1142
00:53:39,166 --> 00:53:40,208
My husband is back.

1143
00:53:40,708 --> 00:53:42,083
What? When? How?

1144
00:53:42,166 --> 00:53:43,500
Why did that wretch come back?

1145
00:53:44,125 --> 00:53:47,541
Pooja. Your husband
is waiting for you on the sofa.

1146
00:53:47,625 --> 00:53:49,083
Who are you talking to on the phone?

1147
00:53:50,416 --> 00:53:51,416
Don't know. It's a wrong number.

1148
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,583
It's some mutt called Tiger.

1149
00:53:54,708 --> 00:53:55,875
I am sorry, Tiger.

1150
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,416
I can never talk to you again.

1151
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:59,291
No, Pooja, please. Hello.

1152
00:53:59,375 --> 00:54:01,000
Don't call me again.

1153
00:54:01,083 --> 00:54:02,000
Hello.

1154
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:07,500
He will never call again.

1155
00:54:07,583 --> 00:54:10,458
-My credit card bill is paid.
-Where is he?

1156
00:54:10,541 --> 00:54:11,583
-That's it.
-Imposter.

1157
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:13,416
Abu Daddy.

1158
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:15,041
-Liar.
-Nawab sir.

1159
00:54:15,125 --> 00:54:16,541
You should fear God.

1160
00:54:16,875 --> 00:54:18,625
How could you keep
such a big secret from us?

1161
00:54:18,708 --> 00:54:21,000
-We're screwed.
-You know who I am.

1162
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:23,333
Nawab sir, I was going to tell you…

1163
00:54:23,416 --> 00:54:24,250
When?

1164
00:54:24,375 --> 00:54:25,833
When were you going to tell me?

1165
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,208
You kept such a big secret from me,
even after my son's wedding.

1166
00:54:30,458 --> 00:54:33,208
Why didn't you tell me
that you also have a son?

1167
00:54:34,208 --> 00:54:35,458
That Pooja has a brother.

1168
00:54:35,708 --> 00:54:37,208
Yeah…

1169
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:40,166
He's not. He's not her brother.

1170
00:54:40,458 --> 00:54:43,208
What's the point of having a brother,

1171
00:54:43,291 --> 00:54:44,916
who couldn't even
attend his sister's wedding?

1172
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,458
Or show up for the ritual
of Raksha Bandhan.

1173
00:54:47,541 --> 00:54:49,125
And he has the audacity to come now!

1174
00:54:49,208 --> 00:54:50,458
When I asked him why now?

1175
00:54:50,791 --> 00:54:53,708
This rascal wants half of the remaining
25,00,000 rupees…

1176
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:56,125
that you agreed to pay me.

1177
00:54:56,208 --> 00:54:57,333
Nawab sir.

1178
00:54:57,916 --> 00:54:58,791
Here you go.

1179
00:54:58,875 --> 00:55:02,666
Throw the 12,50,000 rupees on his face!

1180
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:06,708
My father is not some ATM
who will throw money in your face.

1181
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:08,583
-Greetings.
-Hello.

1182
00:55:09,416 --> 00:55:13,000
I am Shahrukh's aunt who
is more like his younger sister.

1183
00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:15,833
Jumani. You're supposed to button them.

1184
00:55:17,291 --> 00:55:18,625
Where is my daughter-in-law Pooja?

1185
00:55:19,208 --> 00:55:20,875
Dearest, Sister-in-law.

1186
00:55:21,666 --> 00:55:23,791
Dearest, Sister-in-law.

1187
00:55:23,875 --> 00:55:25,625
Pardon my interruption,

1188
00:55:25,833 --> 00:55:28,875
but these two have
always been at loggerheads.

1189
00:55:28,958 --> 00:55:30,666
She just stormed out of here.

1190
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:33,291
I've been trying to call her but
she isn't answering. She is very stubborn.

1191
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:35,500
-Very stubborn.
-You had me scared. I thought maybe she--

1192
00:55:35,583 --> 00:55:37,833
Doesn't matter. I'll call her.

1193
00:55:39,666 --> 00:55:42,541
<i>Radhe…</i>

1194
00:55:42,625 --> 00:55:45,208
Just like identical faces,
they even have identical phones.

1195
00:55:45,416 --> 00:55:46,916
She took his phone and left hers behind.

1196
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,416
Give me your number.

1197
00:55:48,708 --> 00:55:50,875
Listen… duplicate Humayun.

1198
00:55:51,958 --> 00:55:53,166
I am talking to you.

1199
00:55:53,375 --> 00:55:56,458
I don't give my number
to any Tom Dick or an unknown person!

1200
00:55:57,916 --> 00:56:00,333
Tom and Dick are okay,
but who are you calling unknown.

1201
00:56:00,666 --> 00:56:02,375
Don't you have any manners?

1202
00:56:02,458 --> 00:56:04,791
Step Nawab sir,
he's been this way since childhood.

1203
00:56:04,875 --> 00:56:08,458
He didn't speak to me for the first couple
of years when he was born.

1204
00:56:08,541 --> 00:56:10,875
-No one does.
-That's true.

1205
00:56:10,958 --> 00:56:12,083
But he will now.

1206
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:14,208
Now he is my responsibility.

1207
00:56:14,416 --> 00:56:17,625
-Why?
-Send Pooja over as soon as she returns.

1208
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:19,041
I'll make them talk to each other.

1209
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:20,041
Marvelous.

1210
00:56:20,375 --> 00:56:22,166
-Come with me.
-Is this some exchange offer?

1211
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:23,458
-Let's go.
-I won't go.

1212
00:56:23,541 --> 00:56:24,750
-Come on.
-I won't go.

1213
00:56:24,833 --> 00:56:25,750
Let's go.

1214
00:56:25,833 --> 00:56:26,833
I won't go.

1215
00:56:26,916 --> 00:56:27,791
Come, will you?!

1216
00:56:28,583 --> 00:56:30,166
-Come.
-What kind of exchange offer is this?

1217
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:31,500
-Uncle.
-Yes?

1218
00:56:32,125 --> 00:56:33,583
Do you have prison uniforms?

1219
00:56:55,041 --> 00:56:58,041
<i>Your sweet torment…</i>

1220
00:56:58,125 --> 00:57:02,208
<i>Surreptitious torment</i>
<i>Here and around…</i>

1221
00:57:02,333 --> 00:57:05,333
<i>I am angry…</i>

1222
00:57:05,416 --> 00:57:09,583
<i>Cajole me, my love</i>

1223
00:57:09,666 --> 00:57:12,541
<i>I will tease you…</i>

1224
00:57:12,625 --> 00:57:14,750
<i>-Girl…</i>
-Hey, hello.

1225
00:57:14,833 --> 00:57:16,333
Check. Check. Check.

1226
00:57:16,708 --> 00:57:17,583
Turn around.

1227
00:57:18,541 --> 00:57:21,041
Pardon me. I forgot to ask.

1228
00:57:21,125 --> 00:57:22,625
Would you like tea or coffee?

1229
00:57:23,041 --> 00:57:23,916
Booze.

1230
00:57:24,291 --> 00:57:25,750
I want booze. Can you get me some?

1231
00:57:27,791 --> 00:57:30,500
Booze is blasphemy in our religion.

1232
00:57:31,541 --> 00:57:32,791
If you want,

1233
00:57:33,708 --> 00:57:35,458
I can intoxicate you with my eyes.

1234
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,750
There is a rumor in the market…

1235
00:57:38,833 --> 00:57:40,500
I don't know how true it is.

1236
00:57:40,583 --> 00:57:45,000
They say my eyes are identical to Rekha's.

1237
00:57:45,875 --> 00:57:46,791
Can I say something?

1238
00:57:47,791 --> 00:57:51,958
Your eyes are hardly identical
to each other, let alone Rekha's.

1239
00:57:52,208 --> 00:57:53,041
Oh…

1240
00:57:53,125 --> 00:57:54,041
Bilal.

1241
00:57:55,708 --> 00:57:56,541
Bila…

1242
00:57:57,791 --> 00:58:00,333
Shocked, aren't you? I was too.

1243
00:58:00,416 --> 00:58:02,250
That's Pooja's twin brother Karam.

1244
00:58:02,666 --> 00:58:05,041
And he's your brother-in-law Shahrukh.

1245
00:58:05,291 --> 00:58:06,125
Him?

1246
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:07,333
Shahrukh?

1247
00:58:07,416 --> 00:58:08,583
Then henceforth, I am Salman.

1248
00:58:09,916 --> 00:58:12,916
My father ruined his daughter's
life for the sake of money.

1249
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,250
-Who let this douche in?
-Who are you calling a douche?

1250
00:58:15,333 --> 00:58:16,666
You heard what I said. Feel it.

1251
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:19,875
He is your future uncle.

1252
00:58:19,958 --> 00:58:22,041
What uncle, brother-in-law… shit is this!

1253
00:58:22,125 --> 00:58:23,791
Is this some kind of family drama?

1254
00:58:24,625 --> 00:58:27,291
Sona bhai, she isn't answering
my calls either. What do I do?

1255
00:58:29,166 --> 00:58:30,291
I don't drink on duty.

1256
00:58:31,458 --> 00:58:33,458
I have already dialed her number.
Just a minute.

1257
00:58:34,166 --> 00:58:35,583
<i>Radhe…</i>

1258
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:37,333
Hello.

1259
00:58:37,416 --> 00:58:39,000
Hello, Pooja. Sona Bhai.

1260
00:58:39,083 --> 00:58:40,416
Don't utter that idiot's name.

1261
00:58:40,916 --> 00:58:41,750
<i>Sona Bhai. </i>

1262
00:58:41,833 --> 00:58:43,791
Just because he gave me a job,
he won't stop chasing me.

1263
00:58:44,666 --> 00:58:45,750
Who did you call?

1264
00:58:46,208 --> 00:58:47,708
I think her brother answered the phone.

1265
00:58:47,791 --> 00:58:49,291
Brother, give the phone to Pooja.

1266
00:58:49,625 --> 00:58:51,875
Sona Bhai is here with me,
and you're on speaker.

1267
00:58:52,208 --> 00:58:53,666
Brother, give me the phone.

1268
00:58:53,875 --> 00:58:54,791
No, I won't.

1269
00:58:55,083 --> 00:58:56,083
Please.

1270
00:58:56,166 --> 00:58:57,000
<i>First, tell me who is calling. </i>

1271
00:58:57,083 --> 00:58:57,916
<i>It's Sona. </i>

1272
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,083
You're not sleeping with anyone.

1273
00:58:59,166 --> 00:59:01,833
Brother, my life, my rules,
my phone, my balance.

1274
00:59:01,958 --> 00:59:03,750
Hello, Sona Ji.

1275
00:59:03,833 --> 00:59:06,791
My brother called
you an idiot, rascal, donkey,

1276
00:59:06,875 --> 00:59:08,750
stupid, and a good-for-nothing fool.

1277
00:59:09,791 --> 00:59:11,583
Your brother didn't
call me all these things.

1278
00:59:11,791 --> 00:59:14,083
He did. I am sorry for that.

1279
00:59:17,041 --> 00:59:19,041
<i>I want to know about your whereabouts. </i>

1280
00:59:19,291 --> 00:59:20,625
You informed us about one day's absence.

1281
00:59:20,791 --> 00:59:21,666
Two.

1282
00:59:21,916 --> 00:59:23,000
It's been three days now.

1283
00:59:23,125 --> 00:59:25,375
You neither answer my calls
nor do you reply.

1284
00:59:25,458 --> 00:59:26,416
You've stopped coming to the bar, as well.

1285
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:27,791
I can't for a few more days.

1286
00:59:27,875 --> 00:59:28,708
Why?

1287
00:59:29,416 --> 00:59:30,458
I am menstruating.

1288
00:59:30,541 --> 00:59:32,458
I can't do anything for a couple of days.

1289
00:59:32,541 --> 00:59:33,750
Ladies problem.

1290
00:59:33,833 --> 00:59:36,666
Oh… why didn't you say so?

1291
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,500
Here's what you do.
As soon as you're comfortable again,

1292
00:59:40,041 --> 00:59:40,875
come immediately.

1293
00:59:41,875 --> 00:59:42,791
Bye.

1294
00:59:43,583 --> 00:59:44,416
Bye.

1295
00:59:48,208 --> 00:59:49,791
We can't do anything.

1296
00:59:50,208 --> 00:59:52,541
Can you get me a hot water bag?

1297
01:00:41,250 --> 01:00:43,958
Ladies problem! Ladies problem!

1298
01:00:44,125 --> 01:00:45,666
Yes, I know.

1299
01:00:47,208 --> 01:00:48,041
Sleep.

1300
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:13,375
Smiley.

1301
01:01:13,708 --> 01:01:14,541
Smiley.

1302
01:01:15,875 --> 01:01:17,666
-Who is it?
-You… come here.

1303
01:01:17,833 --> 01:01:18,666
It's you.

1304
01:01:19,458 --> 01:01:20,375
Come, let's shower together.

1305
01:01:21,291 --> 01:01:22,625
His SIM card has been activated.

1306
01:01:23,375 --> 01:01:24,625
-Whose?
-Shahrukh's.

1307
01:01:25,041 --> 01:01:26,166
He can make a call at any time.

1308
01:01:26,666 --> 01:01:29,458
I don't know why he's so inclined
towards me these days. I don't know.

1309
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:30,791
I am not doing this drama anymore.

1310
01:01:30,875 --> 01:01:32,416
Are you crazy? What are you doing?

1311
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:34,250
Stand properly. Show some grace.

1312
01:01:34,583 --> 01:01:35,416
You will get us killed.

1313
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:37,791
If Pari finds out about this,

1314
01:01:38,333 --> 01:01:39,625
then we are doomed!
I am going to see her.

1315
01:01:39,708 --> 01:01:41,166
No need to go anywhere.

1316
01:01:42,041 --> 01:01:43,666
I've called daddy's little girl here.

1317
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:44,833
-Here?
-Yes.

1318
01:01:44,916 --> 01:01:47,583
-Why?
-When she sees you dressed as a girl,

1319
01:01:47,666 --> 01:01:50,375
her doubts like why you have
lipstick on your face will be cleared.

1320
01:01:50,708 --> 01:01:51,541
Get it?

1321
01:01:53,250 --> 01:01:55,375
For the first time,
you're making sense, buddy.

1322
01:01:55,708 --> 01:01:56,708
Radhe-Radhe.

1323
01:01:56,875 --> 01:01:59,291
Thank you. Thank you.

1324
01:01:59,875 --> 01:02:03,250
-Man… I troubled you a lot, didn't I?
-It's okay.

1325
01:02:03,333 --> 01:02:06,083
I feel so peaceful
when I take you in my arms.

1326
01:02:06,291 --> 01:02:08,958
No wonder that idiot Shahrukh
is head over heels for you.

1327
01:02:09,791 --> 01:02:11,083
Touch me.

1328
01:02:11,666 --> 01:02:12,791
What is it… Shut up!

1329
01:02:16,041 --> 01:02:17,208
Oh, my God.

1330
01:02:18,791 --> 01:02:21,583
Being an Indian, how can you be
half an hour early?

1331
01:02:22,125 --> 01:02:22,958
This is wrong.

1332
01:02:23,333 --> 01:02:24,291
I am deeply hurt.

1333
01:02:24,666 --> 01:02:25,625
Shut up.

1334
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:27,541
I had my doubts,

1335
01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:29,500
but Sister-in-law, you too?

1336
01:02:32,583 --> 01:02:33,500
Stop your drama.

1337
01:02:34,458 --> 01:02:36,000
What do I do?
Sakina.

1338
01:02:36,083 --> 01:02:40,833
Sakina, listen to me.
It's not what you think.

1339
01:02:41,750 --> 01:02:43,666
Shameless fellow! He's crossed all limits.

1340
01:02:43,916 --> 01:02:46,041
My suspicion has been confirmed.
I hate him.

1341
01:02:48,666 --> 01:02:50,958
From today, no Pooja, only Karam.

1342
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:52,833
Too much fun.

1343
01:02:53,916 --> 01:02:55,291
Hey! You are here.

1344
01:02:58,708 --> 01:02:59,583
I took it off.

1345
01:03:01,083 --> 01:03:01,916
I see.

1346
01:03:02,625 --> 01:03:03,583
Do you have no shame?

1347
01:03:04,375 --> 01:03:06,750
You're saying such
a disgusting thing so proudly.

1348
01:03:07,875 --> 01:03:09,958
-No…
-First that lipstick and now this.

1349
01:03:10,041 --> 01:03:10,875
Listen to me.

1350
01:03:10,958 --> 01:03:11,791
What's there to listen?

1351
01:03:11,875 --> 01:03:13,625
-I've seen what I had to.
-But…

1352
01:03:13,708 --> 01:03:15,416
How could you stoop
so low for money, Karam?

1353
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:17,000
-No…
-Disgusting.

1354
01:03:17,083 --> 01:03:17,916
What is disgusting?

1355
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,541
-Don't follow me!
-Where else should I go?

1356
01:03:19,625 --> 01:03:20,500
-Go to hell.
-Where?

1357
01:03:20,583 --> 01:03:21,750
Go jump in the river.

1358
01:03:21,833 --> 01:03:23,625
I'm telling you that I took it off.

1359
01:03:23,708 --> 01:03:24,708
I forgot to add "from my body. "

1360
01:03:24,791 --> 01:03:26,708
I took it off my own body.

1361
01:03:27,791 --> 01:03:28,791
I own it!

1362
01:03:33,250 --> 01:03:34,166
Pari.

1363
01:03:34,291 --> 01:03:35,583
-Greetings, brother. Radhe-Radhe.
-Yes!

1364
01:03:35,666 --> 01:03:37,666
Pari, that was my bra.
At least, hear me out.

1365
01:03:37,750 --> 01:03:40,375
Really? I never saw you
wear it before. Go to hell.

1366
01:03:40,458 --> 01:03:41,666
Those were my theater costumes.

1367
01:03:41,750 --> 01:03:44,166
You know I've been dressing up
as Radha, Sita, Draupadi since childhood.

1368
01:03:45,125 --> 01:03:46,416
-Don't believe me?
-No.

1369
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:47,916
-Want to speak to the organizer?
-Yes.

1370
01:03:50,041 --> 01:03:52,916
Of course. Talk to him. Organizer!

1371
01:03:54,125 --> 01:03:55,333
<i>Hello, Karam. </i>

1372
01:03:55,416 --> 01:03:57,541
<i>Did you finish trying out your clothes?</i>
<i>Checked the bra yet?</i>

1373
01:03:57,625 --> 01:04:00,250
Yes, it's a bit tight.
Have it loosened by two inches.

1374
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:08,000
Karam, I thought… Forget it. I am sorry.

1375
01:04:09,250 --> 01:04:11,958
Don't doubt me. I am only yours.

1376
01:04:13,208 --> 01:04:14,166
I love you.

1377
01:04:17,291 --> 01:04:18,125
Love you, too.

1378
01:04:18,208 --> 01:04:19,833
You will have to go over my dead body.

1379
01:04:19,916 --> 01:04:20,750
I will.

1380
01:04:20,875 --> 01:04:22,958
Please, buddy. Listen to me. Don't do it.

1381
01:04:23,041 --> 01:04:24,125
He will have us both thrown in jail.

1382
01:04:24,208 --> 01:04:25,666
As if we are having the time
of our lives right now!

1383
01:04:25,750 --> 01:04:26,833
This place is worse than jail.

1384
01:04:26,916 --> 01:04:28,833
My girlfriend, for whom I was doing
all this would have left me.

1385
01:04:28,916 --> 01:04:30,250
-What's the point of all this?
-Try to understand.

1386
01:04:30,333 --> 01:04:31,833
Let's find a solution. Let's Google…

1387
01:04:32,583 --> 01:04:35,291
I'll go to Abu Salim right now,
strip off every piece of cloth,

1388
01:04:35,375 --> 01:04:36,541
and transform from Pooja to Karam.

1389
01:04:36,625 --> 01:04:38,416
He should know,
what he purchased as a moped,

1390
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:39,375
is actually a motorcycle.

1391
01:04:40,041 --> 01:04:43,083
Forget the motorcycle.
Man, he will beat us black and blue.

1392
01:04:43,166 --> 01:04:45,416
Such a big lie,
such a huge fraud.

1393
01:04:45,666 --> 01:04:47,500
I did have my doubts.

1394
01:04:47,791 --> 01:04:49,875
Keep hitting them. Don't stop.

1395
01:04:50,958 --> 01:04:51,791
Uncle…

1396
01:04:51,875 --> 01:04:54,750
-Hit like this.
-Oh, my!

1397
01:04:55,208 --> 01:04:56,416
Why are they hitting them so much?

1398
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:57,708
-Hit these idiots.
-Brother, please.

1399
01:04:57,833 --> 01:04:59,041
They lied to us.

1400
01:04:59,208 --> 01:05:00,125
Lied?

1401
01:05:02,833 --> 01:05:04,166
-Come.
-Your bag…

1402
01:05:04,250 --> 01:05:05,750
Enough now, Uncle.

1403
01:05:07,791 --> 01:05:09,208
Please save me, Brother.

1404
01:05:09,291 --> 01:05:10,916
You rascals…

1405
01:05:11,125 --> 01:05:13,583
Abu Daddy, what happened?
Why are you beating these pure souls?

1406
01:05:13,666 --> 01:05:14,666
They lied to me.

1407
01:05:14,916 --> 01:05:16,500
Said we're going to watch Sunny's film.

1408
01:05:16,791 --> 01:05:18,791
I said, "Let's go, nephews. "

1409
01:05:19,083 --> 01:05:20,958
I watched for 20 minutes.

1410
01:05:21,041 --> 01:05:24,333
Sunny Leone was tearing
up the screen instead of Sunny Deol.

1411
01:05:24,416 --> 01:05:26,166
And someone else
was uprooting the hand pump.

1412
01:05:27,125 --> 01:05:29,625
-It was a small lie.
-Small lie?

1413
01:05:30,041 --> 01:05:32,708
You changed the entire gender,
don't you dare call it a small lie.

1414
01:05:33,583 --> 01:05:35,958
Daughter-in-law,
do you have anything to say?

1415
01:05:36,375 --> 01:05:39,083
Something about a moped
becoming a motorcycle, right?

1416
01:05:39,166 --> 01:05:40,625
We never had such a conversation.

1417
01:05:41,541 --> 01:05:42,666
I was just saying,

1418
01:05:42,750 --> 01:05:45,000
there is nothing wrong
with watching Sunny Leone's film.

1419
01:05:45,083 --> 01:05:48,083
Absolutely.
I have nothing against Sunny Leone.

1420
01:05:48,166 --> 01:05:49,416
She is a lovely girl.

1421
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:50,416
But lies.

1422
01:05:50,750 --> 01:05:52,583
I cannot tolerate lies.

1423
01:05:52,833 --> 01:05:53,666
Beat him.

1424
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:55,083
Brother.

1425
01:05:58,958 --> 01:05:59,833
Bro…

1426
01:06:00,833 --> 01:06:05,375
it took me two hours, two burgers,
and three ice-creams to convince Sakina

1427
01:06:05,458 --> 01:06:08,208
that I wasn't having
an affair with her sister-in-law.

1428
01:06:08,791 --> 01:06:12,250
She checked my entire phone.
Even the batteries.

1429
01:06:12,541 --> 01:06:13,416
Only then, she was convinced.

1430
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:15,208
-It's not funny.
-Quiet. Be quiet.

1431
01:06:17,333 --> 01:06:20,041
Do you know how tough
it is to become a girl?

1432
01:06:20,875 --> 01:06:21,750
No.

1433
01:06:22,375 --> 01:06:25,791
Moreover, it's even more tough
to be a girl.

1434
01:06:26,875 --> 01:06:27,875
Ask me.

1435
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,666
You are drunk. Get up.

1436
01:06:34,375 --> 01:06:36,416
I'll drop you at your in-law's place.

1437
01:06:36,791 --> 01:06:38,541
We brothers will ride together. Come on.

1438
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,041
God knows whose house
you'll take me to this time.

1439
01:06:42,958 --> 01:06:45,666
I'll go on my own. No, wait…

1440
01:06:57,500 --> 01:06:59,958
-Mom is awake.
-Mom is awake.

1441
01:07:00,041 --> 01:07:01,291
-Mom is awake.
-Whose Mom?

1442
01:07:01,791 --> 01:07:04,125
-Dad.
-Dad.

1443
01:07:04,208 --> 01:07:05,375
-Dad.
-What happened?

1444
01:07:05,458 --> 01:07:06,625
Go to bed.

1445
01:07:08,916 --> 01:07:10,791
Mom is awake. Mom is awake.

1446
01:07:10,875 --> 01:07:11,916
-You are awake.
-Mom is awake.

1447
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,041
Mom is awake.

1448
01:07:14,208 --> 01:07:15,125
How did I get here?

1449
01:07:15,208 --> 01:07:17,916
You were lying unconscious
on the street. I brought you here.

1450
01:07:18,958 --> 01:07:20,750
Who wouldn't want to lift a flower?

1451
01:07:22,125 --> 01:07:23,583
-Did I seem like a flower to you?
-Absolutely.

1452
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,916
Even my first wife was a flower.
She came with a flower pot.

1453
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:31,291
I have a question. Were you drunk?

1454
01:07:32,541 --> 01:07:33,916
Yes. Just a little bit of scotch.

1455
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,541
It smelled like oranges.

1456
01:07:36,750 --> 01:07:39,791
Yes. I gulp down a few pegs when need be.

1457
01:07:39,875 --> 01:07:42,000
As you know, dancing in the bar and all…

1458
01:07:42,083 --> 01:07:43,625
Just a few more days.

1459
01:07:43,708 --> 01:07:47,375
As soon as I get divorced,
my children will have a mom.

1460
01:07:48,166 --> 01:07:50,166
Dad, I want to swing in Mom's arms.

1461
01:07:50,250 --> 01:07:52,458
Dad, I want to drink milk.

1462
01:07:54,666 --> 01:07:57,166
Swinging in the arms is fine, but
what's this demand about drinking milk?

1463
01:07:57,250 --> 01:07:59,375
The milk is boiling in the kitchen.
He's talking about that.

1464
01:07:59,458 --> 01:08:01,041
Come on, son. Run along.

1465
01:08:03,125 --> 01:08:06,041
Would you… like to be a mother?

1466
01:08:06,416 --> 01:08:08,750
I can't… be one.

1467
01:08:08,833 --> 01:08:09,708
Leave that to me.

1468
01:08:09,958 --> 01:08:12,625
But… I am marrying someone else.

1469
01:08:12,708 --> 01:08:14,166
I will kill him and marry you.

1470
01:08:16,416 --> 01:08:17,458
You're blushing!

1471
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:19,500
It's pretty late. I should leave.

1472
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:22,416
You cannot leave like this.
I will drop you home.

1473
01:08:22,833 --> 01:08:23,916
You will drop me home?

1474
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:24,875
Why not?

1475
01:08:25,333 --> 01:08:27,458
Even I like to do some charity.

1476
01:08:37,625 --> 01:08:39,458
So, this is where you live.

1477
01:08:39,583 --> 01:08:40,958
In that back alley.

1478
01:08:41,416 --> 01:08:42,416
Then we missed it.

1479
01:08:42,916 --> 01:08:44,958
Stopping in front
of the house won't look nice.

1480
01:08:45,041 --> 01:08:46,791
-Correct.
-Do you know anyone here?

1481
01:08:47,125 --> 01:08:49,208
Yes… few wretched people I know.

1482
01:08:49,750 --> 01:08:50,750
Okay, thanks.

1483
01:08:52,750 --> 01:08:55,416
Before you leave,
say those three magic words.

1484
01:08:57,250 --> 01:08:59,583
I must… pee.

1485
01:09:00,541 --> 01:09:03,916
Oh, my! She was amazing!

1486
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,375
Sister-in-law. Uncle. Kiss.

1487
01:09:11,791 --> 01:09:12,708
Affair.

1488
01:09:15,333 --> 01:09:16,500
This is my case.

1489
01:09:19,041 --> 01:09:22,083
I guess they arranged the money.

1490
01:09:22,166 --> 01:09:23,958
I told you, Dad. Karam will manage.

1491
01:09:29,250 --> 01:09:31,875
Hey, you. Mr. Painter.

1492
01:09:32,625 --> 01:09:33,458
Come here…

1493
01:09:33,541 --> 01:09:35,750
Mister. Hello.

1494
01:09:35,833 --> 01:09:38,750
-Radhe-Radhe.
-Radhe… Radhe-Radhe.

1495
01:09:38,833 --> 01:09:40,208
Radhe-Radhe.

1496
01:09:40,458 --> 01:09:44,125
Did you apply for a top-up loan
to make more money?

1497
01:09:44,291 --> 01:09:47,416
Not at all. We've so much money now

1498
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:49,083
that we can even lend you some.

1499
01:09:49,166 --> 01:09:51,208
-I see. Come, let's sit on the lawn.
-Please come.

1500
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:54,166
{\an8}Sit. I'll go make some tea.

1501
01:10:01,541 --> 01:10:06,500
Wow. She's a bit different
from what I imagined.

1502
01:10:07,083 --> 01:10:09,291
But works for me.

1503
01:10:09,666 --> 01:10:11,291
Pooja.

1504
01:10:12,666 --> 01:10:14,041
Pooja?

1505
01:10:14,291 --> 01:10:15,625
Who are you, brother?

1506
01:10:15,750 --> 01:10:18,666
Mind your language.
Do I look like a brother to you?

1507
01:10:18,750 --> 01:10:22,416
Credit card. Attention. Missing husband.
Adjustment. Remember?

1508
01:10:23,041 --> 01:10:24,000
Tiger.

1509
01:10:25,041 --> 01:10:26,708
-Do you recognize me?
-Tiger who?

1510
01:10:26,791 --> 01:10:31,333
I'll have you arrested
for female harassment, you fool!

1511
01:10:31,833 --> 01:10:34,291
What's that Tiger
from the bank doing here?

1512
01:10:34,583 --> 01:10:36,958
-Tell him. I am your Tiger.
-What?

1513
01:10:37,041 --> 01:10:38,041
You are my Pooja.

1514
01:10:38,125 --> 01:10:40,791
Listen, you lizard.
Have you ever seen Tiger's picture?

1515
01:10:41,250 --> 01:10:45,750
Uncle, you should be ashamed.
Look at your age and her age.

1516
01:10:46,625 --> 01:10:48,333
She is like your daughter.

1517
01:10:48,416 --> 01:10:53,333
Not <i>like</i> my daughter!
She is my daughter.

1518
01:10:53,666 --> 01:10:56,458
-Aren't you Jagjeet?
-I am Jagjeet.

1519
01:10:56,916 --> 01:10:57,833
Who are you?

1520
01:10:58,208 --> 01:11:00,958
-Are you Jagjeet?
-Do you want to see my identity card?

1521
01:11:01,041 --> 01:11:03,041
-You are back?
-Yes, I am.

1522
01:11:03,166 --> 01:11:05,083
Why did you come back in your final days?

1523
01:11:05,166 --> 01:11:06,625
If you go out with Pooja,

1524
01:11:06,708 --> 01:11:09,583
people will say, "What a beautiful
father-daughter duo. "

1525
01:11:09,666 --> 01:11:11,291
No one will call you Pooja's husband.

1526
01:11:11,375 --> 01:11:14,166
Listen, you idiot. Get lost.

1527
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:15,500
Uncle, who is Pooja?

1528
01:11:15,583 --> 01:11:17,916
I don't know
which Pooja he is talking about.

1529
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,083
Mister, I think you have
the wrong Jagjeet.

1530
01:11:21,791 --> 01:11:23,583
I am so sorry. My mistake.

1531
01:11:23,875 --> 01:11:25,958
-If you need a credit card, please call--
-Get out.

1532
01:11:26,041 --> 01:11:27,125
Get lost.

1533
01:11:28,041 --> 01:11:29,875
-Have some.
-It's okay.

1534
01:11:31,166 --> 01:11:36,875
Look, as soon as
you fulfill all my conditions,

1535
01:11:37,083 --> 01:11:40,083
only then will we start preparing
for the wedding.

1536
01:11:40,208 --> 01:11:43,583
Otherwise, Pari gets dozens
of proposals. Every day!

1537
01:11:44,708 --> 01:11:45,583
Let's go.

1538
01:11:50,291 --> 01:11:51,208
Mr. Goldie.

1539
01:11:51,416 --> 01:11:52,291
Sona bhai.

1540
01:11:52,375 --> 01:11:54,583
{\an8}Sir, Hindi is not allowed here.

1541
01:11:54,666 --> 01:11:55,916
Okay.

1542
01:11:56,125 --> 01:11:57,375
-So, Mr. Goldie.
-Yeah?

1543
01:11:57,458 --> 01:12:00,666
{\an8}Your kids are very weak
in dance and English.

1544
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:01,666
{\an8}No, no.

1545
01:12:03,250 --> 01:12:04,708
{\an8}They can be weak in dance,

1546
01:12:04,791 --> 01:12:07,083
{\an8}but in English… unpossible!

1547
01:12:08,458 --> 01:12:09,458
Wait a minute.

1548
01:12:11,375 --> 01:12:13,083
It's the future mother of my children.

1549
01:12:13,291 --> 01:12:14,458
{\an8}Please talk in English.

1550
01:12:14,708 --> 01:12:15,583
Sorry.

1551
01:12:17,833 --> 01:12:18,666
Pooja.

1552
01:12:18,875 --> 01:12:19,875
Where are you?

1553
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,333
{\an8}I am… kid's school. English medium.

1554
01:12:23,791 --> 01:12:25,125
Hindi no allowed here.

1555
01:12:25,291 --> 01:12:27,750
Even if Hindi isn't allowed,
who allowed this English?

1556
01:12:29,083 --> 01:12:31,375
{\an8}So, to what do I owe this call?

1557
01:12:31,458 --> 01:12:32,458
{\an8}-Sir.
-Yes?

1558
01:12:32,541 --> 01:12:33,458
{\an8}No Hindi, please.

1559
01:12:33,541 --> 01:12:34,791
{\an8}Pooja, talk.

1560
01:12:35,541 --> 01:12:37,333
A girl isn't safe even with you around.

1561
01:12:37,541 --> 01:12:38,458
{\an8}Which girl?

1562
01:12:38,708 --> 01:12:39,541
{\an8}Sir.

1563
01:12:41,458 --> 01:12:42,416
{\an8}Which ladies?

1564
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:45,500
Me. Mrs. Pooja Saajan Tiwari.

1565
01:12:45,750 --> 01:12:48,333
Mrs. Pooja Saajan Tiwari?

1566
01:12:49,458 --> 01:12:51,416
{\an8}Children, stop your ears.

1567
01:12:52,458 --> 01:12:55,916
Madam, how do you
say <i>haraamkhor</i> in English?

1568
01:12:57,791 --> 01:12:59,041
And what about <i>Kanoon ki ijjat?</i>

1569
01:12:59,416 --> 01:13:00,416
{\an8}Honor of the law.

1570
01:13:03,041 --> 01:13:06,083
Who put hand on honor of law?

1571
01:13:06,291 --> 01:13:08,875
Some leech called Tiger
from Lena Dena Bank.

1572
01:13:09,625 --> 01:13:10,666
I see.

1573
01:13:10,750 --> 01:13:12,458
He's sending me such dirty messages,

1574
01:13:12,541 --> 01:13:14,333
that every now and then I have
to clean my phone with a disinfectant.

1575
01:13:14,416 --> 01:13:16,291
-That sister--
-Sir.

1576
01:13:16,916 --> 01:13:17,833
{\an8}Please.

1577
01:13:17,916 --> 01:13:18,791
Hold, please.

1578
01:13:20,041 --> 01:13:24,458
Madam, how to say <i>Tucche, behen</i>
<i>de takke and laundiabaaz</i> in English?

1579
01:13:24,541 --> 01:13:26,375
Stop chewing my brains, you bloody moron.

1580
01:13:26,458 --> 01:13:30,125
You good for nothing fool!
Get lost, you wimp!

1581
01:13:31,041 --> 01:13:33,041
Wasn't it fun to abuse in Hindi?

1582
01:13:33,208 --> 01:13:34,375
It's not the same in English.

1583
01:13:34,458 --> 01:13:35,333
Out!

1584
01:13:35,708 --> 01:13:38,083
Dad. Dad.

1585
01:13:38,291 --> 01:13:40,166
You should drown yourself in booze.

1586
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:45,333
My uncle Saajan Tiwari
aka Sona bhai,

1587
01:13:45,416 --> 01:13:49,125
the third husband of Aunt Jumani,

1588
01:13:50,041 --> 01:13:52,500
is having an affair
with sister-in-law Pooja.

1589
01:13:55,291 --> 01:13:56,416
Have you been drinking in the morning?

1590
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:59,916
Will you believe me
when she bears his children?

1591
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:00,916
Enough!

1592
01:14:02,083 --> 01:14:04,250
My daughter-in-law is naive and decent.

1593
01:14:04,666 --> 01:14:07,708
That man is a bloody… Forgive me, Lord.

1594
01:14:07,791 --> 01:14:08,750
Lord will forgive.

1595
01:14:09,041 --> 01:14:09,916
He's a rascal.

1596
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,291
He certainly is!

1597
01:14:12,291 --> 01:14:15,458
At times he's with aunt,
at times he's with sister-in-law.

1598
01:14:15,541 --> 01:14:19,583
He is slowly trapping all
the women in our house.

1599
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:22,625
Thank God, Mom is no more.

1600
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:24,083
Or he would have become my father too.

1601
01:14:24,166 --> 01:14:26,083
Fear God, Son.

1602
01:14:26,458 --> 01:14:28,666
At least leave the dead alone.

1603
01:14:29,541 --> 01:14:33,250
On top of that,
Jumani keeps marrying such idiots.

1604
01:14:33,416 --> 01:14:35,333
One hell of a hobby!

1605
01:14:35,416 --> 01:14:39,500
See, children. This is the home
of your new father. Go on.

1606
01:14:39,583 --> 01:14:40,416
…paint it, brother!

1607
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:42,375
-Dad.
-Dad.

1608
01:14:46,708 --> 01:14:47,666
Oh, my!

1609
01:14:57,708 --> 01:15:02,666
<i>My heart is restless without you</i>

1610
01:15:03,625 --> 01:15:08,416
<i>I am secretly waiting for you</i>

1611
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:09,958
Let them go. Let them breathe.

1612
01:15:10,375 --> 01:15:11,583
-Leave them.
-Oh, yes!

1613
01:15:11,666 --> 01:15:14,666
-Mom!
-Mom!

1614
01:15:14,750 --> 01:15:16,125
Ms. Jumani, you're here.

1615
01:15:16,875 --> 01:15:18,166
Don't be so formal.

1616
01:15:18,250 --> 01:15:21,541
It's been a while. Please, don't stop me.

1617
01:15:23,333 --> 01:15:25,833
I came here for an important discussion.

1618
01:15:25,916 --> 01:15:26,875
Say it.

1619
01:15:27,416 --> 01:15:29,916
I was thinking
of being pretty open about it.

1620
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:33,500
Be as open as you want.
I am open to everything.

1621
01:15:34,041 --> 01:15:37,791
<i>Secretly waiting for you…</i>

1622
01:15:37,875 --> 01:15:39,166
What do you think about me?

1623
01:15:42,083 --> 01:15:43,416
Like family.

1624
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:45,458
Oh, my!

1625
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:47,291
-Thank you.
-Welcome.

1626
01:15:48,541 --> 01:15:52,416
Actually, I've been married thrice.

1627
01:15:52,958 --> 01:15:56,125
But I could never find true love.

1628
01:15:57,416 --> 01:16:00,416
So, I came to talk
about marriage with you.

1629
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:01,416
Marriage?

1630
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:07,333
-Boys. Go play somewhere far away.
-Mom!

1631
01:16:07,416 --> 01:16:08,833
Far… far away.

1632
01:16:10,791 --> 01:16:12,833
Hey!

1633
01:16:16,791 --> 01:16:18,083
-Sit.
-Of course.

1634
01:16:18,166 --> 01:16:19,000
Sit.

1635
01:16:22,750 --> 01:16:25,458
Even at this age, you bustle with energy.

1636
01:16:25,541 --> 01:16:28,625
This is just a trailer.
The film is on another level!

1637
01:16:29,166 --> 01:16:31,666
May God bless you with good health.

1638
01:16:32,666 --> 01:16:35,541
So, you have no objection
to this marriage?

1639
01:16:35,625 --> 01:16:36,833
Me?

1640
01:16:37,208 --> 01:16:41,625
I have no objection
to any kind of marriage or wedding!

1641
01:16:44,166 --> 01:16:46,708
And what about the age factor…

1642
01:16:46,916 --> 01:16:51,000
Age is no restriction, nor is religion.

1643
01:16:51,125 --> 01:16:52,666
These talks are rubbish.

1644
01:16:53,625 --> 01:16:55,041
And children?

1645
01:16:55,125 --> 01:16:58,541
A few out of love are okay.

1646
01:16:58,625 --> 01:16:59,875
Otherwise, you already have two.

1647
01:17:02,333 --> 01:17:03,333
Good God.

1648
01:17:03,416 --> 01:17:04,916
We'll surprise Karam.

1649
01:17:14,416 --> 01:17:18,041
Son, where does Tiger Pandey live?

1650
01:17:19,208 --> 01:17:20,041
Why?

1651
01:17:21,708 --> 01:17:23,000
He wants to open his account.

1652
01:17:25,333 --> 01:17:29,416
He drowned along with
his entire family in the floods.

1653
01:17:31,208 --> 01:17:32,041
Sad news.

1654
01:17:32,125 --> 01:17:34,208
Why are you lying, brother?

1655
01:17:34,291 --> 01:17:36,208
You're the only Tiger Pandey
in the whole of Mathura.

1656
01:17:36,291 --> 01:17:37,166
Quiet.

1657
01:17:37,375 --> 01:17:39,708
But the name doesn't suit your body.

1658
01:17:40,166 --> 01:17:41,125
Right.

1659
01:17:41,208 --> 01:17:42,416
I am thinking of dropping Pandey.

1660
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:43,416
Lose the <i>Tiger. </i>

1661
01:17:43,708 --> 01:17:44,541
I see.

1662
01:17:46,291 --> 01:17:47,166
Come here, you.

1663
01:17:47,250 --> 01:17:48,500
No…

1664
01:17:48,583 --> 01:17:49,625
Fourth marriage?

1665
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:53,125
You've married more times
than the rooms we have in this house.

1666
01:17:53,208 --> 01:17:55,583
Brother, maybe you don't remember.

1667
01:17:55,666 --> 01:18:00,083
During my third wedding
when we went to Ajmer, the wise man said,

1668
01:18:00,166 --> 01:18:03,375
"When I marry someone younger than me,

1669
01:18:03,458 --> 01:18:05,500
that marriage will last a lifetime. "

1670
01:18:05,875 --> 01:18:09,958
If she gets divorced then Sona bhai
will come after sister-in-law Pooja.

1671
01:18:10,041 --> 01:18:10,958
No. No.

1672
01:18:11,041 --> 01:18:15,541
Jumani. It's wrong
to end any relationship like this.

1673
01:18:15,708 --> 01:18:18,291
Try to understand each other.

1674
01:18:18,375 --> 01:18:20,875
Sona is a good catch.

1675
01:18:20,958 --> 01:18:22,625
Don't dismiss him like that!

1676
01:18:22,708 --> 01:18:25,875
What if your next relationship
turns out to be worse than this?

1677
01:18:30,875 --> 01:18:34,875
<i>They raise the glasses in the bar…</i>

1678
01:18:38,916 --> 01:18:40,791
Careful, old man.

1679
01:18:41,166 --> 01:18:44,500
Can't you spot the difference,
between young and old?

1680
01:18:50,625 --> 01:18:52,333
You seem familiar.

1681
01:18:52,416 --> 01:18:54,291
I am not God, I am a human being.

1682
01:18:54,791 --> 01:18:57,041
You must have seen me somewhere.
What brings you here?

1683
01:18:58,166 --> 01:19:00,000
I came here to talk about my divorce.

1684
01:19:00,083 --> 01:19:01,916
-And I came here to talk about my wedding.
-Wedding?

1685
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:03,916
Really?

1686
01:19:04,958 --> 01:19:07,875
There is only one woman in this house,
who offers a buffet of marriages.

1687
01:19:09,458 --> 01:19:10,750
Who are you here for?

1688
01:19:10,833 --> 01:19:12,166
Greetings, son-in-law.

1689
01:19:12,250 --> 01:19:14,041
{\an8}-Here comes bad luck.
-Hello.

1690
01:19:14,208 --> 01:19:15,916
-It's my good luck…
-Him?

1691
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,291
He is not with me.

1692
01:19:17,375 --> 01:19:18,416
He is on his own.

1693
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:19,750
Who are you, sir?

1694
01:19:19,958 --> 01:19:22,375
I am Jagjeet Singh from Mathura.

1695
01:19:24,916 --> 01:19:25,750
Marvelous.

1696
01:19:25,833 --> 01:19:27,041
-Jagjeet.
-Yes.

1697
01:19:27,125 --> 01:19:28,666
{\an8}Shaukiya, take him inside.

1698
01:19:28,750 --> 01:19:31,375
{\an8}-Come, I'll take you in.
-Yes, let's go.

1699
01:19:31,458 --> 01:19:32,875
I am self-dependent.

1700
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:33,875
-Brother.
-Yes?

1701
01:19:33,958 --> 01:19:36,083
Quickly get done with him,
and then we'll discuss the wedding.

1702
01:19:36,416 --> 01:19:37,541
I see.

1703
01:19:38,416 --> 01:19:40,125
You are in a hurry to get married.

1704
01:19:40,208 --> 01:19:41,416
Planning a wedding without a divorce.

1705
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:43,083
-Hey…
-Who?

1706
01:19:43,291 --> 01:19:44,625
I am talking to you.

1707
01:19:45,041 --> 01:19:47,000
I found myself a new husband.

1708
01:19:48,250 --> 01:19:49,291
I see.

1709
01:19:49,583 --> 01:19:51,083
<i>Radhe…</i>

1710
01:19:52,250 --> 01:19:53,083
Excuse me.

1711
01:19:54,458 --> 01:19:56,666
Dad… Dad?

1712
01:19:58,333 --> 01:20:00,666
What have you done to yourself?
Did you swallow a bat?

1713
01:20:00,958 --> 01:20:03,000
I've come to talk about marriage.

1714
01:20:03,083 --> 01:20:04,375
Whose marriage?

1715
01:20:04,458 --> 01:20:07,333
My marriage with Jumani.

1716
01:20:09,166 --> 01:20:11,333
Don't let love drive
you crazy again, Jagjeet.

1717
01:20:11,541 --> 01:20:14,166
It's not me.
That gorgeous lady is crazy for me.

1718
01:20:14,250 --> 01:20:17,416
This man ruined three years of my youth.

1719
01:20:18,166 --> 01:20:19,250
Youth?

1720
01:20:19,791 --> 01:20:22,916
You're that flop picture
that I saw after the interval.

1721
01:20:23,458 --> 01:20:25,458
The first half is still a mystery.

1722
01:20:25,541 --> 01:20:27,416
-I'll bash him now!
-Jumani.

1723
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:29,333
-You look for an excuse to touch me.
-Leave!

1724
01:20:29,875 --> 01:20:34,250
She came home, son.
She said she can't live without me.

1725
01:20:34,333 --> 01:20:35,708
You've lost your mind in old age.

1726
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,958
You don't want to sign the divorce papers?

1727
01:20:38,666 --> 01:20:39,583
Don't.

1728
01:20:40,125 --> 01:20:42,083
I'll get married without a divorce.

1729
01:20:45,333 --> 01:20:46,166
Hello.

1730
01:20:46,750 --> 01:20:48,666
Pick up the phone sometimes.

1731
01:20:50,791 --> 01:20:54,291
Unfortunately,
until they don't get divorced,

1732
01:20:54,541 --> 01:20:55,958
she cannot get married.

1733
01:20:56,041 --> 01:20:59,208
And, we can't have any auspicious
ceremonies for six months, anyway.

1734
01:21:01,250 --> 01:21:02,583
Let's get engaged then.

1735
01:21:04,916 --> 01:21:06,583
You are quite fast.

1736
01:21:06,875 --> 01:21:08,583
If you don't have any problem,

1737
01:21:09,041 --> 01:21:10,791
then I don't have any objection.

1738
01:21:11,125 --> 01:21:12,666
Let Karmu arrive.

1739
01:21:12,791 --> 01:21:14,500
Let's do the ring ceremony first,

1740
01:21:14,625 --> 01:21:15,625
Karam can join us later.

1741
01:21:16,125 --> 01:21:17,500
Then who will I exchange rings with?

1742
01:21:18,333 --> 01:21:19,458
Me.

1743
01:21:23,875 --> 01:21:25,833
What are you saying?

1744
01:21:26,458 --> 01:21:28,708
How can the father-in-law exchange rings
with the daughter-in-law?

1745
01:21:29,125 --> 01:21:30,083
Father-in-law who?

1746
01:21:30,791 --> 01:21:31,708
Which daughter-in-law?

1747
01:21:32,208 --> 01:21:34,666
And why will she
exchange rings with Karam?

1748
01:21:34,916 --> 01:21:36,791
Who else will I exchange rings
with if not him?

1749
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:49,666
Jumani, if you didn't want to marry me,
then why did you make those promises?

1750
01:21:49,875 --> 01:21:52,875
How could you even imagine such a thing?

1751
01:21:53,125 --> 01:21:55,458
I love Karmu
and I will only marry him.

1752
01:21:55,541 --> 01:21:57,666
Then why did you talk
about marriage with me?

1753
01:21:57,916 --> 01:22:01,791
I came to talk about
my marriage with Karmu.

1754
01:22:01,875 --> 01:22:02,916
Have you seen your age?

1755
01:22:03,208 --> 01:22:05,291
Age hardly matters, Jumani.

1756
01:22:05,833 --> 01:22:10,708
I promise I will lay all
the comforts of the world at your feet.

1757
01:22:10,875 --> 01:22:12,416
You don't have that long.

1758
01:22:12,958 --> 01:22:14,416
Remember,

1759
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:19,916
sometimes even if it's the last over…
the batsman swings pretty hard.

1760
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:23,000
I'll swing my arm so hard,
that you will never forget.

1761
01:22:23,250 --> 01:22:25,333
Pooja, tell your father to leave.

1762
01:22:29,333 --> 01:22:30,458
Don't cry, dear.

1763
01:22:30,541 --> 01:22:31,708
Don't cry, child.

1764
01:22:31,791 --> 01:22:33,500
It's not a recent tradition,

1765
01:22:33,583 --> 01:22:35,375
but one followed for many generations.

1766
01:22:35,458 --> 01:22:39,125
A father is always humiliated
at his daughter-in-law's house.

1767
01:22:40,041 --> 01:22:40,875
I am leaving!

1768
01:22:59,166 --> 01:23:03,541
Hello! Hello, Pooja, please don't hang up.

1769
01:23:03,833 --> 01:23:07,416
I am completely in love with you.

1770
01:23:07,666 --> 01:23:08,625
True love.

1771
01:23:08,875 --> 01:23:10,375
<i>I love you!</i>

1772
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:13,333
Hello.

1773
01:23:13,916 --> 01:23:14,791
Hello.

1774
01:23:16,375 --> 01:23:17,208
What is all this?

1775
01:23:17,291 --> 01:23:18,208
Give me my phone.

1776
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:19,916
Who is Tiger?

1777
01:23:20,166 --> 01:23:22,125
Tiger Shroff. Are you a little kid?

1778
01:23:22,208 --> 01:23:23,625
I am not talking about Jackie's kid.

1779
01:23:23,708 --> 01:23:25,125
Who is this Tiger Pandey
that's calling you?

1780
01:23:25,833 --> 01:23:26,708
Tiger Pandey.

1781
01:23:27,125 --> 01:23:28,958
Someone I know. Why should I tell you?

1782
01:23:29,041 --> 01:23:30,000
Why me?

1783
01:23:30,250 --> 01:23:31,916
It's about our family's honor, Pooja.

1784
01:23:32,041 --> 01:23:33,291
About my father's reputation.

1785
01:23:33,375 --> 01:23:35,666
You take money from us,
and have an affair with someone else.

1786
01:23:35,750 --> 01:23:36,708
Enough!

1787
01:23:37,458 --> 01:23:39,916
You are yet to pay 10,00,000 rupees.

1788
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,250
You will never get it, madam.

1789
01:23:41,541 --> 01:23:44,000
You call yourself my husband, right?
Then behave like one.

1790
01:23:44,416 --> 01:23:46,458
-Let's do it tonight.
-What…

1791
01:23:46,666 --> 01:23:48,083
-Come on.
-Stay away.

1792
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:49,458
Don't cross the line.

1793
01:23:49,541 --> 01:23:51,541
You never gave me any line.

1794
01:23:51,791 --> 01:23:53,625
Ravage this fruit orchard.

1795
01:23:53,750 --> 01:23:55,166
Destroy it.

1796
01:23:55,250 --> 01:23:56,500
Cover your orchard.

1797
01:23:56,583 --> 01:23:58,916
This Kiran will be Shahrukh's today.

1798
01:23:59,000 --> 01:23:59,833
-No.
-Yes.

1799
01:23:59,916 --> 01:24:01,875
-No, no!
-Yes.

1800
01:24:02,791 --> 01:24:03,916
Pooja, please!

1801
01:24:04,041 --> 01:24:05,291
Listen to me.

1802
01:24:05,375 --> 01:24:06,625
-I am listening.
-Please.

1803
01:24:06,958 --> 01:24:08,208
-Stop.
-What are you doing?

1804
01:24:08,291 --> 01:24:13,166
You must prove
that you are my real husband.

1805
01:24:13,250 --> 01:24:14,625
Sleep.

1806
01:24:15,291 --> 01:24:16,500
Sleep…

1807
01:24:20,250 --> 01:24:23,250
-What?
-Seems like my old love is back.

1808
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:24,750
Look, I was joking.

1809
01:24:24,833 --> 01:24:26,375
Forget whatever happened
in the last couple of minutes.

1810
01:24:26,458 --> 01:24:28,875
It was a prank. There's the camera. Hi.

1811
01:24:28,958 --> 01:24:30,291
Stop kidding!

1812
01:24:30,541 --> 01:24:31,750
Listen to my heartbeats.

1813
01:24:32,166 --> 01:24:33,750
-This is no joke.
-Control.

1814
01:24:33,833 --> 01:24:35,500
-Control.
-I can't.

1815
01:24:35,625 --> 01:24:37,458
-Leave me.
-Listen…

1816
01:24:37,916 --> 01:24:39,458
-Stay away.
-It will be okay.

1817
01:24:39,541 --> 01:24:41,083
-One arm's distance.
-I won't do anything.

1818
01:24:51,625 --> 01:24:54,750
<i>I set out… on my vehicle</i>

1819
01:24:54,833 --> 01:24:58,166
<i>On the roads and streets</i>

1820
01:24:58,250 --> 01:25:00,833
<i>I came to a turn</i>

1821
01:25:00,916 --> 01:25:04,291
<i>Where I lost my heart</i>

1822
01:25:04,833 --> 01:25:07,541
<i>I came to a turn</i>

1823
01:25:07,625 --> 01:25:10,250
<i>Where I lost my heart…</i>

1824
01:25:14,208 --> 01:25:15,083
Shit.

1825
01:25:22,833 --> 01:25:23,708
What is this?

1826
01:25:25,291 --> 01:25:27,791
Hair fall! Hair fall!

1827
01:25:27,916 --> 01:25:28,833
So much?

1828
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,375
Fake hair…

1829
01:25:33,791 --> 01:25:36,083
Not just the hair, everything is fake.

1830
01:25:37,083 --> 01:25:37,958
See.

1831
01:25:39,458 --> 01:25:40,416
And these too.

1832
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:41,708
Have some vitamin C.

1833
01:25:43,375 --> 01:25:44,291
Hi.

1834
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:45,916
Myself Karam.

1835
01:25:46,416 --> 01:25:47,875
And Karam is Pooja.

1836
01:26:00,958 --> 01:26:02,041
Good Lord!

1837
01:26:03,666 --> 01:26:04,875
What have you done?

1838
01:26:07,916 --> 01:26:08,958
Sorry, buddy.

1839
01:26:09,125 --> 01:26:10,000
Sorry?

1840
01:26:13,041 --> 01:26:13,958
Sorry?

1841
01:26:17,791 --> 01:26:18,708
Oh…

1842
01:26:19,750 --> 01:26:20,750
Now I get it.

1843
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:25,125
The other night, when you fell in my arms,

1844
01:26:26,166 --> 01:26:27,041
that feeling…

1845
01:26:28,666 --> 01:26:32,458
And the other day, when your hand
unintentionally touched mine,

1846
01:26:32,958 --> 01:26:33,875
that feeling…

1847
01:26:35,208 --> 01:26:36,708
I knew it felt like a guy's touch.

1848
01:26:38,083 --> 01:26:39,416
Because you are not a girl,

1849
01:26:40,041 --> 01:26:40,958
you are a guy.

1850
01:26:42,166 --> 01:26:44,583
-Yes, bro.
-My God…

1851
01:26:48,041 --> 01:26:50,458
That's what I like. Boys!

1852
01:26:57,708 --> 01:26:58,916
So, he's your love?

1853
01:27:02,625 --> 01:27:03,458
Good choice.

1854
01:27:03,541 --> 01:27:04,500
Thanks.

1855
01:27:05,666 --> 01:27:07,416
Why did you get married?

1856
01:27:09,041 --> 01:27:11,083
Dad loves me a lot,

1857
01:27:12,041 --> 01:27:13,000
and I love him.

1858
01:27:14,791 --> 01:27:16,041
I couldn't say no.

1859
01:27:16,541 --> 01:27:17,625
Ditto.

1860
01:27:19,125 --> 01:27:21,166
And a father's love…

1861
01:27:22,541 --> 01:27:24,125
is the father of all kinds of love.

1862
01:27:25,041 --> 01:27:27,166
A child stays
in a mother's womb for nine months,

1863
01:27:27,250 --> 01:27:29,666
but forever on a father's conscience.

1864
01:27:30,250 --> 01:27:32,625
I cannot spend a lifetime in this house.

1865
01:27:33,208 --> 01:27:35,708
I've become so prone
to wearing a burka now,

1866
01:27:35,791 --> 01:27:39,416
yesterday when I ate <i>kheer, </i>I could
only get the milk and not the rice.

1867
01:27:44,125 --> 01:27:47,250
What do we do? Where do we go?

1868
01:27:48,583 --> 01:27:49,916
We don't have a choice, man!

1869
01:27:51,875 --> 01:27:52,791
What happened?

1870
01:27:52,875 --> 01:27:54,625
No, not over here. Go out.

1871
01:27:54,916 --> 01:27:56,625
Why is his phone unreachable?

1872
01:27:57,500 --> 01:27:58,625
Smiley.

1873
01:27:59,958 --> 01:28:00,875
Hey, Sakina.

1874
01:28:07,250 --> 01:28:08,916
Who is vomiting at this hour?

1875
01:28:11,125 --> 01:28:12,625
Wear your wig.

1876
01:28:13,750 --> 01:28:16,291
Otherwise, my father will die
of shock like my grandfather.

1877
01:28:23,666 --> 01:28:24,833
Daddy dearest.

1878
01:28:25,041 --> 01:28:26,958
There is no such thing as true love.

1879
01:28:27,208 --> 01:28:28,333
It's just a sham.

1880
01:28:28,625 --> 01:28:30,250
Absolutely right.

1881
01:28:32,958 --> 01:28:33,875
Hello.

1882
01:28:33,958 --> 01:28:37,333
Jagjeet. Congratulations.

1883
01:28:37,416 --> 01:28:38,750
Congratulations to you, too.

1884
01:28:38,958 --> 01:28:40,833
But what are you congratulating me for?

1885
01:28:40,916 --> 01:28:44,041
With the grace of Allah,
Pooja is pregnant.

1886
01:28:45,291 --> 01:28:48,708
Pat… pat him on the back.

1887
01:28:49,041 --> 01:28:49,875
What happened?

1888
01:28:51,333 --> 01:28:52,166
When did this happen?

1889
01:28:52,333 --> 01:28:53,416
We just found out.

1890
01:28:53,625 --> 01:28:55,958
Are you paying more money?

1891
01:28:56,041 --> 01:28:57,291
Forget money,

1892
01:28:57,375 --> 01:29:00,750
we'll give everything
we have to our daughter-in-law.

1893
01:29:01,458 --> 01:29:03,333
You should celebrate too, Jagjeet.

1894
01:29:03,416 --> 01:29:04,625
You are going to be a grandfather.

1895
01:29:04,708 --> 01:29:05,666
Radhe-Radhe.

1896
01:29:05,791 --> 01:29:06,708
What happened?

1897
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:12,041
Something that has never happened
in this universe before!

1898
01:29:12,833 --> 01:29:14,041
-Radhe-Radhe.
-Radhe-Radhe.

1899
01:29:15,625 --> 01:29:17,875
I am very happy today. Do pray.

1900
01:29:17,958 --> 01:29:18,791
Oh, yes.

1901
01:29:18,875 --> 01:29:21,583
First, at least know
who you should pray for.

1902
01:29:22,291 --> 01:29:23,208
Do tell!

1903
01:29:23,375 --> 01:29:25,291
My daughter-in-law is pregnant.

1904
01:29:25,375 --> 01:29:26,791
Marvelous.

1905
01:29:26,875 --> 01:29:27,875
What is happening?

1906
01:29:28,666 --> 01:29:32,458
If your blank check gets en-cashed,
this is how you lose your mind.

1907
01:29:32,916 --> 01:29:34,166
Has a murder ever taken place
in your house?

1908
01:29:34,750 --> 01:29:35,583
No.

1909
01:29:35,666 --> 01:29:37,625
Stop your father or there will be one.

1910
01:29:39,416 --> 01:29:42,041
Hey, mister. Get in line.
We've been waiting for a long time.

1911
01:29:42,125 --> 01:29:42,958
Get lost.

1912
01:29:43,041 --> 01:29:44,916
He is my son.

1913
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:46,958
We are seeing this day
because of his hard work.

1914
01:29:47,041 --> 01:29:48,958
I'll always be grateful for the happiness

1915
01:29:49,125 --> 01:29:51,541
you've bestowed upon me today.

1916
01:29:52,125 --> 01:29:53,416
Dad, we need to talk.

1917
01:29:53,833 --> 01:29:54,666
Go ahead.

1918
01:29:54,958 --> 01:29:58,083
I've something to tell you, but…

1919
01:29:58,375 --> 01:29:59,250
Tell me.

1920
01:30:01,250 --> 01:30:02,375
Pooja cannot get pregnant.

1921
01:30:04,791 --> 01:30:05,708
As in?

1922
01:30:05,791 --> 01:30:07,666
As in, I can't become a father,
she can't become an aunt.

1923
01:30:07,750 --> 01:30:09,416
You can't become a grandfather.
Him… I don't know.

1924
01:30:11,333 --> 01:30:12,333
But you…

1925
01:30:13,375 --> 01:30:14,333
No, no…

1926
01:30:14,708 --> 01:30:17,666
Don't blame daughter-in-law
for your weaknesses.

1927
01:30:17,750 --> 01:30:20,250
It's not my fault. The doctors advised
her against it. Go tell them.

1928
01:30:20,333 --> 01:30:22,000
-Are you sure?
-I swear on my father.

1929
01:30:23,291 --> 01:30:24,416
Good Lord.

1930
01:30:24,583 --> 01:30:26,000
Bilal. Javed.

1931
01:30:26,583 --> 01:30:29,583
Take all the gifts back.
Make sure you count the cash.

1932
01:30:29,791 --> 01:30:30,625
Goodbye.

1933
01:30:30,708 --> 01:30:31,791
But what happened?

1934
01:30:31,875 --> 01:30:34,541
Nothing happened, that's
why we're taking all the gifts back.

1935
01:30:34,625 --> 01:30:35,458
Please, leave.

1936
01:30:35,541 --> 01:30:36,416
I don't know how to tell you.

1937
01:30:36,500 --> 01:30:39,250
I thought I would become a grandfather…

1938
01:30:39,333 --> 01:30:41,333
I wanted to tell you, but…

1939
01:30:41,416 --> 01:30:42,708
-Leave.
-Tell him, Sakina.

1940
01:30:42,791 --> 01:30:44,750
-Dad. Let's talk about it.
-Dad…

1941
01:30:44,833 --> 01:30:45,875
-Dad.
-Dad.

1942
01:30:46,166 --> 01:30:47,041
Dad!

1943
01:30:47,125 --> 01:30:48,791
-Brother Shaukiya!
-Dad!

1944
01:30:49,333 --> 01:30:50,791
-Dad!
-Dad!

1945
01:30:50,875 --> 01:30:52,500
-Is he dead?
-Dad!

1946
01:30:52,583 --> 01:30:54,041
What is wrong with him?

1947
01:30:54,375 --> 01:30:56,708
Yes, tell him to stop drinking.

1948
01:30:56,791 --> 01:30:57,666
Brother.

1949
01:30:58,125 --> 01:30:59,166
Brother.

1950
01:31:00,250 --> 01:31:01,291
What happened to him?

1951
01:31:03,875 --> 01:31:05,541
What happened to my brother?

1952
01:31:05,625 --> 01:31:07,291
Brother is fine.

1953
01:31:07,375 --> 01:31:10,333
But what if something would have
happened to me because of your face?

1954
01:31:10,458 --> 01:31:11,583
Do you want a beating?

1955
01:31:12,041 --> 01:31:13,541
What happened to my brother?

1956
01:31:13,833 --> 01:31:16,791
I came straight from
the beauty parlor when I got the news.

1957
01:31:16,875 --> 01:31:19,416
Thank God, you're not coming
from the spa. Otherwise…

1958
01:31:19,750 --> 01:31:20,708
Seems like he needs a beating, as well.

1959
01:31:21,125 --> 01:31:22,458
Someone, please tell me what happened!

1960
01:31:22,541 --> 01:31:24,791
He had chest pain. Almost a heart attack.

1961
01:31:24,875 --> 01:31:26,166
How? Why?

1962
01:31:28,583 --> 01:31:30,916
Pooja cannot have children. That's why.

1963
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:33,791
Pooja can't have children?

1964
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:39,083
Pooja. Come here.

1965
01:31:39,833 --> 01:31:42,208
Take a glass of hot milk.
Add some turmeric…

1966
01:31:42,291 --> 01:31:46,041
We know the process.
Milk. <i>Shilajit. </i> We know.

1967
01:31:46,125 --> 01:31:47,375
Scientifically, she can't.

1968
01:31:50,875 --> 01:31:54,416
Where science ends, he begins.

1969
01:31:55,125 --> 01:31:55,958
Who?

1970
01:31:57,875 --> 01:31:59,583
{\an8}Is this Baba House or the Parliament?

1971
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,500
Who is spitting?

1972
01:32:03,750 --> 01:32:06,375
I told you, Dad.
People will spit on us.

1973
01:32:06,458 --> 01:32:08,250
It's not spit. It's perfume.

1974
01:32:09,250 --> 01:32:10,583
-Let's go.
-I am not going in.

1975
01:32:10,666 --> 01:32:11,666
What are you doing?

1976
01:32:12,458 --> 01:32:14,291
This is Dad's wish. We must fulfill it.

1977
01:32:14,833 --> 01:32:16,500
You have come too far in the act now.
A little more won't hurt.

1978
01:32:30,083 --> 01:32:31,208
She can't have a child.

1979
01:32:31,291 --> 01:32:32,208
What?

1980
01:32:32,708 --> 01:32:35,208
It's okay, Pooja. We'll try again. Come.

1981
01:32:35,291 --> 01:32:38,666
She can have children! That too, twins!

1982
01:32:38,750 --> 01:32:39,750
This Baba is a fraud.

1983
01:32:39,833 --> 01:32:42,666
Absolutely right.
My innocent daughter is right.

1984
01:32:42,750 --> 01:32:43,916
When did you arrive?

1985
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,541
On 20th February, 1956.

1986
01:32:45,625 --> 01:32:47,166
He isn't asking for your birth date.

1987
01:32:47,250 --> 01:32:50,458
Look, won't we both become grandparents?

1988
01:32:50,541 --> 01:32:51,791
No. No. Let's go.

1989
01:32:51,875 --> 01:32:52,875
-Yes, let's go.
-Come on.

1990
01:32:52,958 --> 01:32:53,833
Calling me a fraud?

1991
01:32:54,791 --> 01:32:57,166
All the children that you see here…

1992
01:32:57,416 --> 01:33:02,000
Raju, Bittu, Vikki, Donor,
Sonu's Titu's Sweety…

1993
01:33:02,083 --> 01:33:04,375
They all are a result of my treatment.

1994
01:33:04,458 --> 01:33:07,500
-The doctor said I can't have children.
-Yes, the doctor…

1995
01:33:07,583 --> 01:33:10,875
I've blessed big doctors with little ones.

1996
01:33:11,666 --> 01:33:14,000
Look, we only want only one little one…

1997
01:33:14,083 --> 01:33:16,083
I mean only one child. Only one.

1998
01:33:16,166 --> 01:33:17,000
Right, child?

1999
01:33:20,250 --> 01:33:23,750
These people are hellbent on getting
me pregnant, which is impossible.

2000
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,791
Talk to your family!

2001
01:33:25,875 --> 01:33:27,875
Even I am tired of them.

2002
01:33:28,208 --> 01:33:30,125
I would move out
if I found a better family.

2003
01:33:30,208 --> 01:33:31,666
Pooja. Pooja.

2004
01:33:32,125 --> 01:33:33,750
I cannot take this anymore.

2005
01:33:33,833 --> 01:33:35,083
Then take the rollers off
and wash your face.

2006
01:33:36,416 --> 01:33:38,291
I wasn't talking about this.

2007
01:33:38,375 --> 01:33:40,625
I am talking about your brother Karmu.

2008
01:33:40,833 --> 01:33:42,250
He isn't answering my calls.

2009
01:33:42,500 --> 01:33:45,625
Tell him to talk to me.

2010
01:33:46,166 --> 01:33:48,791
Look, Auntie. Karam is my brother.

2011
01:33:48,875 --> 01:33:50,958
But he's a womanizer!

2012
01:33:51,208 --> 01:33:53,166
Sorry for my language. He's a big flirt.

2013
01:33:53,250 --> 01:33:54,625
He proposes to anyone.

2014
01:33:55,041 --> 01:33:57,000
He still has a couple of ongoing affairs.

2015
01:33:59,958 --> 01:34:01,625
You won't understand, Pooja.

2016
01:34:02,583 --> 01:34:07,041
Freelancers go from pillar to post.

2017
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:11,708
And only those with
a permanent job stay in one place.

2018
01:34:12,375 --> 01:34:13,291
And anyway,

2019
01:34:16,333 --> 01:34:18,000
like a <i>Pathaan</i> once said,

2020
01:34:18,458 --> 01:34:21,291
"When you love someone with dedication,

2021
01:34:21,375 --> 01:34:25,166
the universe conspires to unite you two. "

2022
01:34:25,333 --> 01:34:26,208
Hello.

2023
01:34:27,333 --> 01:34:28,833
-One suggestion.
-What?

2024
01:34:29,125 --> 01:34:31,041
-Don't ever say this dialogue again.
-Why?

2025
01:34:31,125 --> 01:34:33,916
-If Shahrukh hears you…
-Not me. The real one.

2026
01:34:34,375 --> 01:34:35,291
He won't be able to bear it.

2027
01:34:36,083 --> 01:34:37,083
I don't care.

2028
01:34:37,750 --> 01:34:39,541
If your brother doesn't come and see me…

2029
01:34:39,791 --> 01:34:42,625
I will swallow poison and die.

2030
01:34:43,166 --> 01:34:44,291
Good God!

2031
01:34:44,708 --> 01:34:46,500
Judging by the clowns
your family is made up of,

2032
01:34:47,166 --> 01:34:48,333
you should put them
on display and sell tickets.

2033
01:34:48,416 --> 01:34:50,916
I understand. But you must meet her once.

2034
01:34:51,208 --> 01:34:53,916
If she dies, then… What is the name
of your friend from Mathura?

2035
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,291
Your brother-in-law. Smiley.

2036
01:34:55,375 --> 01:34:56,458
Yes. How embarrassing!

2037
01:34:56,541 --> 01:34:58,125
He and Sakina can never get married.

2038
01:35:02,958 --> 01:35:03,833
<i>Radhe…</i>

2039
01:35:03,916 --> 01:35:06,583
Smiley bro, are you feeling
restless without Pooja?

2040
01:35:06,666 --> 01:35:09,833
I don't, but Sona bhai does.

2041
01:35:09,916 --> 01:35:12,708
You sound as if he's pointing
a gun at your head.

2042
01:35:12,791 --> 01:35:14,458
Don't be stupid.

2043
01:35:14,541 --> 01:35:16,791
Sona bhai is a gem of a person.

2044
01:35:16,875 --> 01:35:19,541
He is a great guy. And he loves you a lot.

2045
01:35:20,250 --> 01:35:21,166
Am I right, Sona bhai?

2046
01:35:22,833 --> 01:35:23,875
<i>Pooja. </i>

2047
01:35:24,291 --> 01:35:25,958
Where are you?

2048
01:35:26,125 --> 01:35:27,500
Hi, Sona.

2049
01:35:28,458 --> 01:35:30,333
I am good. Just hold on.

2050
01:35:31,791 --> 01:35:33,416
Hello, Karmu.

2051
01:35:34,791 --> 01:35:35,875
Where have you reached?

2052
01:35:35,958 --> 01:35:38,541
Yes, Jumani. Get to Pappu's Diner.

2053
01:35:38,625 --> 01:35:39,958
Order some food. I will be there.

2054
01:35:41,958 --> 01:35:42,916
Yes, what were you saying?

2055
01:35:43,458 --> 01:35:46,291
Tell me… when are we meeting?

2056
01:35:46,375 --> 01:35:50,041
I am busy right now. I'll meet you later.
Till then just chill.

2057
01:35:50,125 --> 01:35:51,125
We have to meet today.

2058
01:35:51,208 --> 01:35:52,166
I can't.

2059
01:35:52,541 --> 01:35:54,250
Pooja, look.

2060
01:35:54,791 --> 01:35:56,666
If you don't show up in 30 minutes,

2061
01:35:56,958 --> 01:36:00,958
then you'll have to let me know
where to send Smiley's dead body.

2062
01:36:01,166 --> 01:36:03,416
-Kill him.
-What are you saying?

2063
01:36:03,500 --> 01:36:04,625
I mean give him the phone.

2064
01:36:04,708 --> 01:36:06,708
-We're on speaker.
-Yes, we're on speaker. Go ahead.

2065
01:36:07,625 --> 01:36:09,666
I'm sending you the location. See you.

2066
01:36:10,250 --> 01:36:11,125
She is sending it.

2067
01:36:14,250 --> 01:36:15,583
How am I going to meet them both?

2068
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:16,875
I'm doomed.

2069
01:36:17,625 --> 01:36:18,875
<i>I know you want it</i>

2070
01:36:22,375 --> 01:36:23,708
<i>I like it like that</i>

2071
01:36:24,708 --> 01:36:26,000
Pooja. Here…

2072
01:36:30,291 --> 01:36:31,666
Is this any way to call someone?

2073
01:36:31,833 --> 01:36:33,833
Threatening an innocent Sikh man.

2074
01:36:33,916 --> 01:36:35,750
Yes, sister, I am deeply hurt.

2075
01:36:35,833 --> 01:36:36,666
Shut up.

2076
01:36:37,750 --> 01:36:39,208
Is this any way
to call anyone for marriage?

2077
01:36:40,791 --> 01:36:43,833
How much does your mobile weigh?

2078
01:36:43,916 --> 01:36:45,083
Around 300 grams.

2079
01:36:45,166 --> 01:36:46,666
Then why don't you pick it up?

2080
01:36:47,333 --> 01:36:51,791
Look, Pooja, why don't you understand,

2081
01:36:51,875 --> 01:36:54,000
I cannot live without you.

2082
01:36:54,250 --> 01:36:55,083
Never.

2083
01:36:55,166 --> 01:36:58,000
I live for you, die for you!
I'll live down your street!

2084
01:36:58,083 --> 01:36:59,791
Life without you is impossible.

2085
01:36:59,875 --> 01:37:00,958
Life is short.

2086
01:37:01,041 --> 01:37:03,375
This is not a game.
<i>Deewane, Parwane, Khurrane. </i>

2087
01:37:04,708 --> 01:37:07,666
I told you a dozen times
I am getting married to a guy.

2088
01:37:08,416 --> 01:37:09,583
What does the guy do?

2089
01:37:09,958 --> 01:37:11,208
He loves me a lot.

2090
01:37:11,291 --> 01:37:13,833
I didn't mean personally.
I meant professionally.

2091
01:37:14,500 --> 01:37:15,583
He is in CBI.

2092
01:37:16,291 --> 01:37:17,958
Scared you, right?

2093
01:37:18,291 --> 01:37:19,416
It even scared me that night.

2094
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:23,541
CBI stands for Central Bank of India.
He's a cashier there.

2095
01:37:23,625 --> 01:37:25,416
You should tell the full form then. Right?

2096
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:26,541
Correct. Correct.

2097
01:37:34,041 --> 01:37:36,333
It's so hot in here. AC is not working.

2098
01:37:36,416 --> 01:37:37,458
I feel repressed.

2099
01:37:38,291 --> 01:37:40,333
I must rush to the toilet.

2100
01:37:40,416 --> 01:37:41,333
Go on, sister.

2101
01:37:41,833 --> 01:37:43,125
Or you might just do it here.

2102
01:37:43,833 --> 01:37:44,666
Right?

2103
01:37:46,125 --> 01:37:48,500
Hello. Have you reached Pappu's Diner?

2104
01:37:48,583 --> 01:37:50,291
I already had half a dozen parathas.

2105
01:37:50,375 --> 01:37:51,458
Didn't like them at all.

2106
01:37:51,625 --> 01:37:53,208
I am at the cafe next door.

2107
01:37:53,291 --> 01:37:54,875
-Come here.
-Coming.

2108
01:37:55,041 --> 01:37:55,958
Two minutes.

2109
01:37:58,083 --> 01:37:58,916
Hey…

2110
01:37:59,208 --> 01:38:00,291
This is the gents toilet.

2111
01:38:00,666 --> 01:38:02,333
-Ladies toilet is over there.
-Sorry.

2112
01:38:05,791 --> 01:38:06,958
I'm looking beautiful.

2113
01:38:08,541 --> 01:38:09,500
What is all this?

2114
01:38:10,125 --> 01:38:12,041
Is this the correct way?
You'll commit suicide if I don't come!

2115
01:38:12,916 --> 01:38:15,333
First, you took the sister,
and now you want the brother, as well.

2116
01:38:15,708 --> 01:38:17,625
Here's some advice, take my father too.

2117
01:38:17,916 --> 01:38:19,208
And end our family.

2118
01:38:19,291 --> 01:38:20,333
Your father?

2119
01:38:20,583 --> 01:38:22,125
He's a bad deal.

2120
01:38:22,750 --> 01:38:23,750
I want you.

2121
01:38:23,833 --> 01:38:24,833
I don't want you.

2122
01:38:25,333 --> 01:38:27,750
I love someone else. Her name is Pari.

2123
01:38:27,958 --> 01:38:29,000
I love her a lot.

2124
01:38:31,875 --> 01:38:33,208
Don't cry like that,
I won't be able to control my laughter.

2125
01:38:33,791 --> 01:38:35,125
What is it that I lack?

2126
01:38:35,208 --> 01:38:36,208
I'll WhatsApp you the entire list.

2127
01:38:36,291 --> 01:38:38,833
Right now, it's not you,
it's the place. Let's go to Pappu's Diner.

2128
01:38:38,916 --> 01:38:41,208
No, I don't want to go to Pappu's Diner.

2129
01:38:41,458 --> 01:38:42,666
Look around.

2130
01:38:42,750 --> 01:38:44,125
There are young people all around,
just like us.

2131
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:45,833
Young?

2132
01:38:48,916 --> 01:38:50,208
It's time to go to the toilet.

2133
01:38:50,833 --> 01:38:52,166
How can there be a fixed time for it?

2134
01:38:52,250 --> 01:38:55,250
This is not like Swiggy or Zomato,
which arrives on order.

2135
01:38:55,333 --> 01:38:56,750
Hold it till tomorrow.

2136
01:38:56,833 --> 01:38:58,375
This is yesterday's!

2137
01:39:01,041 --> 01:39:01,875
She disconnected my call.

2138
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:19,833
Excuse me.

2139
01:39:20,291 --> 01:39:22,125
One orange on that table.

2140
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:23,333
Sure, ma'am.

2141
01:39:26,125 --> 01:39:28,666
Well, my job was to unite two love birds.

2142
01:39:29,041 --> 01:39:31,000
-I'll see you guys later. Okay, sister.
-Yes, leave.

2143
01:39:31,083 --> 01:39:31,916
Bye.

2144
01:39:33,958 --> 01:39:36,958
Pooja, why do you have
a hand on your heart?

2145
01:39:38,750 --> 01:39:42,458
You hurt me so much,
that my heart on this side is aching.

2146
01:39:42,833 --> 01:39:43,750
I see.

2147
01:39:46,791 --> 01:39:49,166
Madam, your orange juice.

2148
01:39:49,958 --> 01:39:52,541
I asked for the fruit,
but you brought juice instead.

2149
01:39:52,916 --> 01:39:54,333
This is healthy as well, madam.

2150
01:39:54,416 --> 01:39:56,375
-Come on.
-Are you a dietician?

2151
01:39:56,750 --> 01:39:58,125
Just get what madam ordered.

2152
01:39:58,208 --> 01:39:59,166
Come on, out.

2153
01:39:59,791 --> 01:40:00,666
Pooja,

2154
01:40:01,833 --> 01:40:03,791
I have a small request.

2155
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,833
If not me, think about my children.

2156
01:40:07,208 --> 01:40:08,875
How can they live without a mother?

2157
01:40:09,416 --> 01:40:12,666
If this was just an infatuation,
I would have cheated on him.

2158
01:40:12,750 --> 01:40:14,791
-But we are childhood sweethearts.
-Child…

2159
01:40:15,083 --> 01:40:17,125
-Childhood?
-We used to play doctor-doctor together.

2160
01:40:17,875 --> 01:40:19,166
You know what doctor-doctor is, right?

2161
01:40:19,708 --> 01:40:22,250
Madam, we are out of fresh oranges.

2162
01:40:22,333 --> 01:40:24,083
Can I get you a watermelon?

2163
01:40:24,291 --> 01:40:25,125
Watermelon?

2164
01:40:25,791 --> 01:40:26,625
Do you have anything smaller?

2165
01:40:26,708 --> 01:40:28,250
Madam, grapes?

2166
01:40:28,333 --> 01:40:30,125
So… Narrow-minded!

2167
01:40:30,375 --> 01:40:31,375
That leaves us with bananas.

2168
01:40:31,583 --> 01:40:32,416
Shut up.

2169
01:40:32,500 --> 01:40:33,416
Get out!

2170
01:40:33,958 --> 01:40:34,833
Banana!

2171
01:40:40,541 --> 01:40:41,375
Toilet…

2172
01:40:41,458 --> 01:40:43,083
-Toilet?
-I got to go.

2173
01:40:44,083 --> 01:40:47,125
Look, Pooja. Take ten minutes extra,

2174
01:40:47,208 --> 01:40:48,666
but finish your business this time.

2175
01:40:58,708 --> 01:40:59,833
Radhe-Radhe, Mr. Sona.

2176
01:40:59,916 --> 01:41:02,166
Radhe-Radhe. You are early.

2177
01:41:02,375 --> 01:41:04,041
Why did you suddenly call me here?

2178
01:41:04,250 --> 01:41:06,958
-Pooja isn't listening to me.
-Oh.

2179
01:41:07,041 --> 01:41:10,125
So I thought,
if one female speaks to another,

2180
01:41:10,291 --> 01:41:11,333
it will make a difference.

2181
01:41:11,500 --> 01:41:13,083
But where is Pooja?

2182
01:41:19,500 --> 01:41:20,375
Karam.

2183
01:41:22,416 --> 01:41:23,250
Cake, sir.

2184
01:41:23,333 --> 01:41:24,333
Come on, stand up.

2185
01:41:24,416 --> 01:41:26,000
I was going to stand up anyway.

2186
01:41:26,500 --> 01:41:27,500
Close your eyes.

2187
01:41:28,375 --> 01:41:29,375
I won't.

2188
01:41:29,458 --> 01:41:30,583
Please do it.

2189
01:41:31,708 --> 01:41:32,583
Fine.

2190
01:41:33,791 --> 01:41:40,000
I always wished to go down on my knees
and propose to my boyfriend.

2191
01:41:40,583 --> 01:41:41,791
I love you, Karam.

2192
01:41:41,958 --> 01:41:43,875
No woman should bow before any man.

2193
01:41:43,958 --> 01:41:45,000
Get up. What are you doing?

2194
01:41:45,583 --> 01:41:47,458
Have you lost your mind?

2195
01:41:48,041 --> 01:41:49,166
Yes, in your love.

2196
01:41:56,625 --> 01:41:57,625
Hello.

2197
01:41:57,708 --> 01:41:58,583
Where are you?

2198
01:41:58,875 --> 01:42:01,625
I am with a client, on duty.

2199
01:42:02,291 --> 01:42:03,583
Do it properly.

2200
01:42:04,958 --> 01:42:06,958
Don't get fired from this job, as well.

2201
01:42:11,125 --> 01:42:12,000
Hello.

2202
01:42:14,041 --> 01:42:14,958
Who was it?

2203
01:42:15,500 --> 01:42:18,666
It's… time to go to the toilet.

2204
01:42:18,750 --> 01:42:19,583
Again?

2205
01:42:19,791 --> 01:42:20,625
Yes.

2206
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:21,875
But…

2207
01:42:29,958 --> 01:42:33,791
Now you two must take three dips
in the Yamuna River.

2208
01:42:34,291 --> 01:42:35,291
Hold hands.

2209
01:42:36,208 --> 01:42:38,000
Not mine. Hold your wife's hand.

2210
01:42:39,333 --> 01:42:41,875
Now take God's name and go ahead.

2211
01:42:41,958 --> 01:42:43,500
You'll be successful. Okay?

2212
01:42:43,583 --> 01:42:44,416
-Go.
-Careful.

2213
01:42:44,500 --> 01:42:48,416
Dad, why travel all the way
from Agra to Mathura to take a dip?

2214
01:42:49,166 --> 01:42:51,541
-For the heir of the family.
-For what?

2215
01:43:06,458 --> 01:43:07,541
-One.
-One.

2216
01:43:12,958 --> 01:43:14,208
-Two.
-Two.

2217
01:43:16,750 --> 01:43:17,750
-Three.
-Three.

2218
01:43:21,583 --> 01:43:22,791
Good God…

2219
01:43:26,250 --> 01:43:27,083
Pooja.

2220
01:43:28,458 --> 01:43:29,708
-Pooja.
-Pooja.

2221
01:43:29,875 --> 01:43:31,166
Dearest… Sister-in-law.

2222
01:43:31,250 --> 01:43:32,125
Pooja.

2223
01:43:32,625 --> 01:43:34,625
-Baba, where's Pooja?
-Pooja!

2224
01:43:34,708 --> 01:43:35,625
Where is Pooja?

2225
01:43:35,916 --> 01:43:37,208
Pooja drowned.

2226
01:43:37,291 --> 01:43:38,250
Pooja.

2227
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:40,833
My daughter has drowned.

2228
01:43:41,250 --> 01:43:42,666
Look for her!

2229
01:43:42,916 --> 01:43:44,291
-Pooja.
-Pooja!

2230
01:43:44,375 --> 01:43:45,958
Find her. Please, find her.

2231
01:43:46,041 --> 01:43:47,166
-Where did she go?
-Pooja!

2232
01:43:47,250 --> 01:43:48,333
Where did she disappear?

2233
01:43:48,416 --> 01:43:49,958
My daughter has drowned.

2234
01:43:51,083 --> 01:43:52,916
Not me. Find Pooja.

2235
01:43:53,500 --> 01:43:54,500
Uncle, careful! What are you doing?!

2236
01:43:54,583 --> 01:43:56,166
-Pooja!
-Pooja!

2237
01:43:56,250 --> 01:43:57,750
Pooja.

2238
01:43:57,833 --> 01:43:59,208
-Find her.
-Did you find her?

2239
01:44:00,166 --> 01:44:02,125
Dearest sister-in-law, my foot!
You killed her.

2240
01:44:03,208 --> 01:44:04,208
Sister-in-law!

2241
01:44:11,333 --> 01:44:12,250
They killed her.

2242
01:44:12,375 --> 01:44:14,500
They killed Pooja.

2243
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,375
For the sake of a child,

2244
01:44:17,708 --> 01:44:21,000
they took my daughter's life.

2245
01:44:21,458 --> 01:44:23,208
I had only one daughter.

2246
01:44:23,291 --> 01:44:24,791
I could have had another.

2247
01:44:25,916 --> 01:44:31,041
But an evil Surpanakha ruined my plan.

2248
01:44:31,375 --> 01:44:34,541
-Mom, who is this evil Surpanakha?
-Shut up!

2249
01:44:34,625 --> 01:44:38,583
Ladies and gentlemen, my countrymen…

2250
01:44:38,791 --> 01:44:42,500
these three men killed my daughter.

2251
01:44:42,666 --> 01:44:45,166
I couldn't save you.

2252
01:44:45,250 --> 01:44:48,958
Look, what happened was an accident.

2253
01:44:49,875 --> 01:44:52,000
Even we are sad about Pooja's demise.

2254
01:44:53,958 --> 01:44:55,375
You're lying, old man.

2255
01:45:00,666 --> 01:45:02,458
Why is he carrying a belt?

2256
01:45:02,541 --> 01:45:06,083
Maybe he forgot to put it
on after hearing about his sister.

2257
01:45:08,041 --> 01:45:10,416
Who told my sister to bear a child?

2258
01:45:13,333 --> 01:45:16,250
So, you want me to utter his name?

2259
01:45:16,750 --> 01:45:18,291
Forget it. Let it go.

2260
01:45:18,375 --> 01:45:20,791
Have a big heart like
your big belt and forgive him.

2261
01:45:21,041 --> 01:45:22,625
It will give peace
to our daughter-in-law's soul.

2262
01:45:22,708 --> 01:45:23,625
Daughter-in-law!

2263
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:25,166
That's the problem.

2264
01:45:25,750 --> 01:45:27,750
This wouldn't have happened
if you had treated her as a daughter.

2265
01:45:28,625 --> 01:45:30,125
Who took her to the Baba?

2266
01:45:30,708 --> 01:45:32,125
Where's the beauty queen of your family?

2267
01:45:32,208 --> 01:45:35,625
Beauty queen?
We have no such member in the family.

2268
01:45:35,708 --> 01:45:37,208
Idiot, your aunt.

2269
01:45:37,291 --> 01:45:38,625
There she is.

2270
01:45:39,666 --> 01:45:40,958
You took her to that Baba, right?

2271
01:45:41,041 --> 01:45:42,916
I swear on my children.

2272
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,416
I always treated Pooja
as my elder sister…

2273
01:45:45,500 --> 01:45:47,208
-and I have always helped her.
-Take this woman away.

2274
01:45:47,583 --> 01:45:49,125
I don't hit women.

2275
01:45:49,208 --> 01:45:51,125
You can hit her with the belt though.

2276
01:45:51,500 --> 01:45:53,166
Idiot. Do you want a beating?

2277
01:45:54,250 --> 01:45:59,333
But Karmu,
you said you don't talk to your sister.

2278
01:45:59,750 --> 01:46:01,375
Where is this love suddenly coming from?

2279
01:46:01,458 --> 01:46:02,833
I thought I'd speak to her today.

2280
01:46:02,916 --> 01:46:05,458
But my sister's life ended
before I could start a conversation.

2281
01:46:05,666 --> 01:46:09,208
You guys drowned my sister
in Yamuna and killed her, you rascals.

2282
01:46:10,291 --> 01:46:12,625
It's people like you
who inspire <i>Crime Patrol </i>episodes.

2283
01:46:13,416 --> 01:46:15,458
Daughter-in-law, dowry, children, murder!

2284
01:46:15,833 --> 01:46:17,583
And soon a web series will air.

2285
01:46:18,083 --> 01:46:19,458
"Revenge of my sister's death. "

2286
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:23,708
A brother beats his sister's in-laws
to death with his belt,

2287
01:46:23,791 --> 01:46:25,208
and sets the manor on fire.

2288
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,333
And then he surrenders
at Agra police station.

2289
01:46:28,416 --> 01:46:29,291
Hey, you!

2290
01:46:30,208 --> 01:46:32,291
Don't mistake our silence
for our weakness.

2291
01:46:32,375 --> 01:46:34,958
Hey, you…
I don't mistake you for anything.

2292
01:46:35,041 --> 01:46:36,250
See… that's the problem.

2293
01:46:36,333 --> 01:46:38,708
The more you let these douches in,
the more harmful they are.

2294
01:46:38,791 --> 01:46:43,541
Pizza is better when served hot,
and brothers-in-law are better when calm.

2295
01:46:44,041 --> 01:46:44,875
Hi.

2296
01:46:45,541 --> 01:46:47,083
I am Tiger Pandey from Lena Dena Bank.

2297
01:46:47,166 --> 01:46:48,625
Is this Pooja's house?

2298
01:46:48,708 --> 01:46:50,583
-Yes, it is.
-Pooja is no more.

2299
01:46:51,500 --> 01:46:52,541
No more? No…

2300
01:46:53,166 --> 01:46:56,708
I am talking about Ms. Pooja.
36-24-36… curvaceous body.

2301
01:46:56,791 --> 01:46:57,875
-Where is she?
-Come here.

2302
01:47:01,416 --> 01:47:03,958
Aren't you ashamed
to describe a dead woman's figure?

2303
01:47:04,208 --> 01:47:05,166
Dead woman?

2304
01:47:05,583 --> 01:47:06,500
Pooja is dead?

2305
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,375
She is my Pooja? So beautiful!

2306
01:47:11,125 --> 01:47:12,875
She died before we could meet.

2307
01:47:13,583 --> 01:47:15,791
-How?
-In the process of having children!

2308
01:47:15,916 --> 01:47:17,833
In the process of having children?

2309
01:47:17,916 --> 01:47:19,166
Tell me this is a lie.

2310
01:47:19,416 --> 01:47:21,083
Tell me that Pooja can't die.

2311
01:47:24,125 --> 01:47:26,583
U. P. POLICE ALWAYS AT YOUR SERVICE

2312
01:47:26,750 --> 01:47:28,083
{\an8}-Sona bhai.
-Yes?

2313
01:47:29,083 --> 01:47:31,166
{\an8}Sona bhai, I've been trying to tell you…

2314
01:47:31,250 --> 01:47:33,041
{\an8}-but you don't listen.
-What is it?

2315
01:47:34,083 --> 01:47:36,250
The signal from Pooja's number
is coming from here.

2316
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:37,958
Here?

2317
01:47:38,041 --> 01:47:40,041
Right here.

2318
01:47:41,916 --> 01:47:44,500
Why do all my wives turn out from here?

2319
01:47:45,333 --> 01:47:46,833
<i>Radhe…</i>

2320
01:47:47,375 --> 01:47:48,291
Yeah.

2321
01:47:49,125 --> 01:47:50,041
What are you saying?

2322
01:47:54,833 --> 01:47:55,666
Greetings.

2323
01:47:56,333 --> 01:47:59,291
What was Pooja doing here?

2324
01:47:59,375 --> 01:48:01,583
You're asking this as if you don't know.

2325
01:48:01,666 --> 01:48:03,416
Weren't you after my daughter-in-law?

2326
01:48:04,083 --> 01:48:05,458
Pooja is your daughter-in-law?

2327
01:48:07,458 --> 01:48:10,166
People won't even curse him,
and you gave Pooja to him.

2328
01:48:10,250 --> 01:48:11,916
-It's him, right?
-Listen, you uncouth Uncle!

2329
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,916
Pooja gave her life
to get you off her back.

2330
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:15,916
What?

2331
01:48:16,625 --> 01:48:17,833
Gave her life?

2332
01:48:19,291 --> 01:48:21,791
What will I do with this ring now,

2333
01:48:22,125 --> 01:48:24,708
when the one who was supposed
to wear it is dead?

2334
01:48:27,708 --> 01:48:30,166
{\an8}Sona bhai, Pooja's phone is still active.

2335
01:48:31,041 --> 01:48:31,875
So?

2336
01:48:32,333 --> 01:48:33,375
But Pooja is dead, isn't she?

2337
01:48:33,625 --> 01:48:36,375
Pooja is dead, not her phone.

2338
01:48:36,458 --> 01:48:39,250
{\an8}By active I mean… it's moving.

2339
01:48:39,333 --> 01:48:40,791
-Walking…
-Show me.

2340
01:48:42,458 --> 01:48:43,750
I see!

2341
01:48:47,333 --> 01:48:49,458
Where were you?
Pari is getting married today.

2342
01:48:49,708 --> 01:48:52,250
Don't piss me off.
There's already a lot of chaos inside.

2343
01:48:52,333 --> 01:48:53,708
I swear she is getting married.

2344
01:48:54,875 --> 01:48:57,208
I am so unlucky. Pari is getting married?

2345
01:48:57,708 --> 01:48:59,291
Yes, she is. And she is doing it today.

2346
01:48:59,375 --> 01:49:01,166
Come with me. What are you waiting for?

2347
01:49:24,791 --> 01:49:25,750
Why are you here?

2348
01:49:29,375 --> 01:49:30,250
You're getting married?

2349
01:49:30,416 --> 01:49:32,291
Yes, I am getting married.

2350
01:49:32,583 --> 01:49:33,791
So, go away.

2351
01:49:34,375 --> 01:49:35,875
How can you do this to me?

2352
01:49:35,958 --> 01:49:37,791
Why? Who are you to me?

2353
01:49:38,166 --> 01:49:39,625
Why should I ask you
before getting married?

2354
01:49:41,791 --> 01:49:42,708
Your Karam.

2355
01:49:42,791 --> 01:49:44,583
You were mine. Not anymore.

2356
01:49:45,750 --> 01:49:48,500
Go be with the woman
that was with you.

2357
01:49:48,708 --> 01:49:50,000
Have you considered her age, Karam?

2358
01:49:50,083 --> 01:49:50,916
You are a creep!

2359
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,333
That… Jumani.

2360
01:49:53,416 --> 01:49:55,291
Man! It's a mess. Let me explain.

2361
01:49:55,375 --> 01:49:56,416
-I don't want to listen--
-Hear me out…

2362
01:49:56,500 --> 01:49:58,500
I've heard enough, but not anymore.

2363
01:50:01,333 --> 01:50:02,666
I love you.

2364
01:50:02,791 --> 01:50:04,458
Don't. Please.

2365
01:50:05,791 --> 01:50:08,416
Now it's all about my family and my life.

2366
01:50:25,458 --> 01:50:27,625
Congratulations, Mr. Srivastav.

2367
01:50:27,708 --> 01:50:30,541
Your daughter's wedding…
that too, on such short notice.

2368
01:50:30,750 --> 01:50:31,791
Did you have dinner?

2369
01:50:31,875 --> 01:50:34,333
-Yes, I did. The food was delicious.
-Thank you.

2370
01:50:34,416 --> 01:50:36,583
Keep the envelopes over there.
Let me show you.

2371
01:50:40,208 --> 01:50:41,416
Who turned off the lights?

2372
01:50:41,500 --> 01:50:42,666
Why's the power out?

2373
01:51:11,750 --> 01:51:16,875
<i>In your love, my vagabond heart</i>

I couldn't stop thinking,

2390
01:52:29,583 --> 01:52:32,416
that my daughter-in-law drowned
in the water, for the sake of a child.

01:53:47,916 --> 01:53:50,291
<i>It's easier to convince God</i>

2407
01:53:50,375 --> 01:53:52,708
<i>Than to convince your love</i>

2408
01:53:52,791 --> 01:53:55,166
<i>Day and night your memories are with me</i>

2409
01:53:55,250 --> 01:53:57,500
<i>Every night, you are all I talk about</i>

2410
01:53:57,583 --> 01:54:02,083
<i>Waiting for you on the path you tread on</i>

2411
01:54:02,166 --> 01:54:06,708
<i>If you marry anyone else other than me</i>

2412
01:54:06,791 --> 01:54:09,083
<i>I will die</i>

2413
01:54:09,166 --> 01:54:11,666
<i>I will die</i>

2414
01:54:11,750 --> 01:54:16,583
<i>If I find out anyone has touched you</i>

2415
01:54:16,666 --> 01:54:18,791
<i>I will die</i>

2416
01:54:18,958 --> 01:54:22,125
<i>I will die</i>

2417
01:54:40,083 --> 01:54:41,291
Such a huge fraud!

2418
01:54:41,541 --> 01:54:43,583
We thought she was Shilpa Shetty,

2419
01:54:44,041 --> 01:54:45,458
but he turned out to be Suniel Shetty.

2420
01:54:46,083 --> 01:54:47,041
Now I remember…

2421
01:54:47,750 --> 01:54:52,541
why your grandpa wrote on the wall
"Daughter-in-law… boy. "

2422
01:54:55,041 --> 01:54:56,750
Grandpa died due to this shock.

2423
01:54:56,833 --> 01:54:58,041
Good God!

2424
01:54:59,291 --> 01:55:01,416
Couldn't you find someone else in Agra?

2425
01:55:01,500 --> 01:55:03,625
That someone else is you!

2426
01:55:03,833 --> 01:55:04,958
I was the first one.

2427
01:55:05,833 --> 01:55:09,541
I checked every bottle in my bar.

2428
01:55:10,666 --> 01:55:11,916
But I couldn't check him.

2429
01:55:12,250 --> 01:55:16,416
This is where I put
my mom's surgery money.

2430
01:55:16,875 --> 01:55:19,875
He changed the time, situation…

2431
01:55:19,958 --> 01:55:23,125
In fact, he changed the entire gender.

2432
01:55:23,208 --> 01:55:25,458
So there is no Pooja?

2433
01:55:25,708 --> 01:55:27,125
Only Karam exists!

2434
01:55:27,916 --> 01:55:29,583
I am worried for Shahrukh.

2435
01:55:29,666 --> 01:55:31,041
He might slip into depression again.

2436
01:55:31,125 --> 01:55:32,291
I won't be depressed.

2437
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:34,041
I never was.

2438
01:55:37,041 --> 01:55:38,458
Karam is Pooja. And Pooja is Karam.

2439
01:55:39,541 --> 01:55:40,958
And I was already aware of this.

2440
01:55:41,625 --> 01:55:42,458
You were?

2441
01:55:42,875 --> 01:55:44,208
Why didn't you tell me?

2442
01:55:44,291 --> 01:55:45,250
Why would he?

2443
01:55:45,708 --> 01:55:47,666
He wanted a boy!

2444
01:55:48,041 --> 01:55:49,291
What is all this, Karam?

2445
01:55:50,083 --> 01:55:50,958
Why?

2446
01:56:00,083 --> 01:56:03,791
To show you the things
I did to make you mine.

2447
01:56:06,250 --> 01:56:08,833
I am still trying to make money.

2448
01:56:09,375 --> 01:56:10,541
From Karam I became Pooja.

2449
01:56:10,791 --> 01:56:11,666
Now…

2450
01:56:12,750 --> 01:56:13,833
back to Karam.

2451
01:56:14,875 --> 01:56:17,166
And all of you must
be thinking why I did it.

2452
01:56:18,833 --> 01:56:20,291
To fulfill his conditions.

2453
01:56:21,291 --> 01:56:22,333
But I couldn't succeed.

2454
01:56:23,583 --> 01:56:26,583
A house, a job, around
30,00,000 rupees in the bank.

2455
01:56:26,666 --> 01:56:28,000
That too, within six months.

2456
01:56:28,791 --> 01:56:32,791
We middle-class people can't spend
such a huge amount in six months,

2457
01:56:32,875 --> 01:56:33,916
then how can we earn it?

2458
01:56:36,833 --> 01:56:38,458
I couldn't fulfill your conditions.

2459
01:56:40,708 --> 01:56:41,916
But that's not why I am sad.

2460
01:56:43,625 --> 01:56:45,250
I am sad because,

2461
01:56:45,791 --> 01:56:50,041
I changed my gender
for the sake of my love,

2462
01:56:50,416 --> 01:56:53,208
and she didn't think twice
before marrying someone else.

2463
01:56:54,291 --> 01:56:57,708
Being a lawyer doesn't mean
you doubt your love.

2464
01:56:58,250 --> 01:56:59,958
If it was a one-time thing,

2465
01:57:00,166 --> 01:57:01,208
I would have never doubted you.

2466
01:57:01,625 --> 01:57:02,750
I saw you several times.

2467
01:57:03,416 --> 01:57:05,458
And the other day
I saw you hugging Jumani.

2468
01:57:06,708 --> 01:57:07,833
I saw you take the red rose.

2469
01:57:07,916 --> 01:57:09,458
And my suspicion was confirmed.

2470
01:57:09,541 --> 01:57:10,791
That's what I am talking about!

2471
01:57:11,333 --> 01:57:13,291
It's my bad luck.

2472
01:57:14,125 --> 01:57:16,791
I say one thing, people hear another.

2473
01:57:17,750 --> 01:57:18,666
Ms. Pari,

2474
01:57:18,791 --> 01:57:21,875
not everything you see and hear is true.

2475
01:57:23,083 --> 01:57:25,041
This drama I did,

2476
01:57:26,166 --> 01:57:28,291
was only for the sake of my love.

2477
01:57:28,708 --> 01:57:31,791
Who pretends to be a girl for his love?

2478
01:57:32,125 --> 01:57:34,041
You could be whatever you wanted.

2479
01:57:34,250 --> 01:57:35,791
Why become our daughter-in-law?

2480
01:57:35,875 --> 01:57:38,875
I instantly recognized
Ranveer Singh in a skirt.

2481
01:57:39,083 --> 01:57:40,375
But I couldn't recognize him.

2482
01:57:40,750 --> 01:57:42,791
Such a big fraud in the name of love.

2483
01:57:43,291 --> 01:57:44,666
I had never seen it until now!

2484
01:57:44,750 --> 01:57:45,708
I see.

2485
01:57:46,958 --> 01:57:48,708
How would you know what love is?

2486
01:57:49,833 --> 01:57:52,083
If you did, you would
love your children so much,

2487
01:57:52,166 --> 01:57:53,750
they would never miss their mother.

2488
01:57:54,083 --> 01:57:57,583
You just wanted a lover under
the pretext of giving them a mother.

2489
01:57:58,041 --> 01:58:02,250
And Jumani, treat relationships like EMI.

2490
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:06,208
Keep paying the EMI on time,
otherwise, you'll get a breakup notice.

2491
01:58:08,666 --> 01:58:09,833
And you… Lena Dena Bank.

2492
01:58:11,041 --> 01:58:12,750
You have no sympathy for the poor.

2493
01:58:13,416 --> 01:58:15,250
You'll never waive
off the loan of some poor man.

2494
01:58:15,708 --> 01:58:18,208
But a beautiful girl says a few words,

2495
01:58:18,291 --> 01:58:19,916
and you'll pay her loan from your pocket,

2496
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,291
using the money kept
for your mom's surgery.

2497
01:58:22,750 --> 01:58:23,708
Shame on you.

2498
01:58:24,333 --> 01:58:25,208
Shaukiya.

2499
01:58:25,458 --> 01:58:29,000
Don't go on with… dearest sister-in-law…
Give her some respect.

2500
01:58:29,416 --> 01:58:30,250
Accepted.

2501
01:58:31,250 --> 01:58:32,166
Salim sir.

2502
01:58:33,625 --> 01:58:37,416
We wait for several years
for our child to start speaking.

2503
01:58:38,375 --> 01:58:40,791
But we don't listen when they do.

2504
01:58:42,291 --> 01:58:43,125
Bro…

2505
01:58:45,041 --> 01:58:46,000
love is love.

2506
01:58:48,416 --> 01:58:49,250
Love.

2507
01:58:50,416 --> 01:58:51,416
Love.

2508
01:58:53,083 --> 01:58:54,000
Love.

2509
01:58:55,166 --> 01:58:57,291
And my love's father.

2510
01:58:59,166 --> 01:59:01,291
Uncle, everything I ever did,

2511
01:59:02,166 --> 01:59:03,166
I did it for my love.

2512
01:59:04,458 --> 01:59:05,541
For Pari's love.

2513
01:59:06,291 --> 01:59:07,458
For my dad's love.

2514
01:59:07,958 --> 01:59:09,500
For my friend's love.

2515
01:59:10,750 --> 01:59:11,833
But I couldn't succeed.

2516
01:59:13,625 --> 01:59:15,583
So neither you are wrong nor is Pari.

2517
01:59:16,208 --> 01:59:17,333
I could be wrong.

2518
01:59:18,625 --> 01:59:21,500
Karam, I thought you
and Jumani were having an affair.

2519
01:59:22,250 --> 01:59:23,208
I thought…

2520
01:59:23,916 --> 01:59:24,875
I thought!

2521
01:59:26,750 --> 01:59:28,916
"I thought you will say sorry. "

2522
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:30,833
"I thought you will call me. "

2523
01:59:30,916 --> 01:59:32,666
"I thought you will come to meet me. "

2524
01:59:32,750 --> 01:59:34,416
"I thought you are cheating on me. "

2525
01:59:34,500 --> 01:59:36,125
"I thought this… I thought that… "

2526
01:59:36,208 --> 01:59:38,583
This, "I thought" has screwed the world.

2527
01:59:40,083 --> 01:59:41,541
If you ever have doubts
about a relationship,

2528
01:59:42,416 --> 01:59:44,875
then clear it face to face.

2529
01:59:44,958 --> 01:59:46,875
It strengthens the bond.

2530
01:59:47,625 --> 01:59:50,958
So Ms. Pari, if you think…

2531
01:59:51,541 --> 01:59:53,708
you'll be happier with this guy,

2532
01:59:54,708 --> 01:59:55,708
then go ahead.

2533
01:59:56,750 --> 01:59:58,541
I won't be the first guy,

2534
01:59:58,625 --> 02:00:00,416
whose girlfriend
will marry another person.

2535
02:00:04,791 --> 02:00:05,708
And uncle…

2536
02:00:08,208 --> 02:00:11,416
never look down on lovers like us.

2537
02:00:12,500 --> 02:00:15,666
When the time comes,
we can go to great lengths.

2538
02:00:23,666 --> 02:00:24,750
Radhe-Radhe.

2539
02:00:54,250 --> 02:00:55,708
No fun at all.

2540
02:00:57,375 --> 02:00:58,583
That's true!

2541
02:00:59,375 --> 02:01:01,458
You didn't like the snacks either?

2542
02:01:25,083 --> 02:01:27,125
It's the same song.

2543
02:01:27,875 --> 02:01:29,625
But uncle, why didn't they come by road?

2544
02:01:29,708 --> 02:01:31,125
Let's ask them.

2545
02:01:35,375 --> 02:01:36,333
Karam.

2546
02:01:37,208 --> 02:01:38,041
Karam.

2547
02:01:38,250 --> 02:01:39,125
Hey!

2548
02:02:54,208 --> 02:02:55,291
I doubted you.

2549
02:02:56,416 --> 02:02:57,291
I am sorry.

2550
02:03:01,791 --> 02:03:02,666
Listen.

2551
02:03:04,208 --> 02:03:05,666
You become everyone's dream girl,

2552
02:03:06,500 --> 02:03:07,416
won't you become mine?
