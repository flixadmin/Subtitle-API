1
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:28,124
You guys didn't tell me
this stuff smells like cat piss.

2
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,267
Man, shit happens, huh?

3
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,835
I mean, I'm sorry, but I had to do it.

4
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:16,672
Obviously, I guess you see it different.

5
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,841
Some of you.
But I didn't see any other choice.

6
00:04:19,925 --> 00:04:23,053
I've been thinking about this all day,
going over it in my head,

7
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:25,473
and it was the only way.

8
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:28,768
Well, it's not like I wanted to.

9
00:04:28,934 --> 00:04:31,186
The kid was on a dirt bike.
He could've just...

10
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:34,773
He could've gunned it and been gone
before we even had a chance to blink.

11
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:38,110
We never would've caught him.
I thought on my feet. I saw a threat,

12
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:41,655
{\an8}- and I took care of it.
- A threat?

13
00:04:41,822 --> 00:04:44,158
{\an8}The kid was waving at us.

14
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:46,619
{\an8}He wasn't going anywhere.
He was saying hi.

15
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,121
{\an8}- Yeah, but you don't know that.
- Yeah, I do.

16
00:04:49,288 --> 00:04:52,958
{\an8}- He didn't know what he'd seen.
- I didn't want to take that chance.

17
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:56,575
The whole point of this was no one
was supposed to know we were there.

18
00:04:57,004 --> 00:04:59,506
People weren't supposed to
know anything got robbed.

19
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,634
{\an8}How could we let the kid go?

20
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:06,847
{\an8}He made us. If I hadn't done what I did,
the mission would've failed. I'm real sorry.

21
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,851
{\an8}I really am, but I...

22
00:05:11,018 --> 00:05:15,815
But did I make a mistake, Mr. White?
Because to me, you know, respectfully

23
00:05:15,981 --> 00:05:18,900
I was looking out for the team.
I didn't want to kill him.

24
00:05:18,984 --> 00:05:20,736
You gotta believe that.

25
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:24,573
{\an8}At the end of the day, it was him or us,
and I chose us.

26
00:05:25,157 --> 00:05:27,409
{\an8}And I would do it again.

27
00:05:28,452 --> 00:05:30,538
{\an8}Okay, look.

28
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:32,873
{\an8}Todd

29
00:05:33,707 --> 00:05:37,586
{\an8}why don't you step outside for a few
minutes so we can talk this through?

30
00:05:37,753 --> 00:05:39,303
Of course. Yeah, you guys talk.

31
00:05:39,421 --> 00:05:43,221
{\an8}But I just want to make sure that you
know that my priority is this business.

32
00:05:43,341 --> 00:05:45,177
{\an8}Okay. That's fine, Todd. Thank you.

33
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:48,138
{\an8}I want to be a real part of this.

34
00:05:48,305 --> 00:05:52,017
All right? If you could just see that.
I'm motivated and I've got connections.

35
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:56,981
{\an8}My uncle's got his hookups in prison who
I think could be a real help to us if...

36
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:09,326
Okay. That dude? Wack job.

37
00:06:09,493 --> 00:06:13,038
- Let's just stick to the facts here.
- Facts? Oh, okay.

38
00:06:13,205 --> 00:06:15,332
{\an8}How about the fact that he shot a kid?

39
00:06:15,499 --> 00:06:17,501
{\an8}A kid that he didn't need to shoot.

40
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:19,712
{\an8}Well, the boy had seen us.

41
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:24,216
{\an8}And, no, it didn't look like he knew
what he was seeing.

42
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:27,678
{\an8}But what if he told somebody?

43
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:30,514
{\an8}What if he just mentioned it in passing?

44
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:32,433
We can't know what someone...

45
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,437
{\an8}Exactly. We can't know,
because Ricky Hitler there shot him.

46
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:40,190
{\an8}We, us three, should've had
a discussion about it.

47
00:06:40,357 --> 00:06:41,691
{\an8}We would've figured it out.

48
00:06:41,775 --> 00:06:45,154
But that dickhead just went ahead
and made the choice for us.

49
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:48,198
- Is that how we do business now?
- I understand you're upset.

50
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:51,744
{\an8}And what was that crap about his uncle
with the prison connections?

51
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:55,789
It's just some bullshit intimidation move.
Come on.

52
00:06:55,956 --> 00:06:59,209
It's true, though.
He does have some connections.

53
00:06:59,376 --> 00:07:03,047
{\an8}- Is this a problem?
- No. It's nothing to be concerned about.

54
00:07:03,213 --> 00:07:05,466
{\an8}It came up in the background
I did on him.

55
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:08,260
Didn't worry me then. He's just flexing.

56
00:07:11,388 --> 00:07:13,140
{\an8}All right.

57
00:07:13,974 --> 00:07:16,309
{\an8}It seems to me that
we have three options here,

58
00:07:16,393 --> 00:07:18,312
{\an8}and none of which are ideal.

59
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,357
{\an8}One, we fire Todd.

60
00:07:21,523 --> 00:07:24,860
- Yeah.
- I'm not a fan of this option

61
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:28,906
{\an8}seeing that he knows way too much
about this business at this point.

62
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:32,493
{\an8}And we'd most likely have to pay him
to keep quiet.

63
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,704
And God only knows
we've got enough of that going on.

64
00:07:37,539 --> 00:07:39,083
{\an8}Two

65
00:07:40,542 --> 00:07:41,752
we dispose of him.

66
00:07:49,301 --> 00:07:51,845
Which leaves us option three.

67
00:07:52,012 --> 00:07:53,847
We keep him on payroll.

68
00:07:54,014 --> 00:07:57,601
{\an8}Put him back on tenting houses,
setting up the lab and so forth.

69
00:07:57,768 --> 00:08:01,021
We keep him close. Under our control.

70
00:08:01,438 --> 00:08:06,068
Now, option three would be my choice.

71
00:08:06,485 --> 00:08:08,278
Shall we vote?

72
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:13,200
{\an8}I vote three, kid.

73
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,843
You're still in.

74
00:08:33,178 --> 00:08:37,391
Right on. Thank you so much.
You guys totally made the right...

75
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:42,479
The next time you bring a gun to a job
without telling me

76
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:46,025
I will stick it up your ass sideways.

77
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:49,820
- You understand?
- Yes, sir.

78
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:47,127
Hey, boss. What's up?

79
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,338
I was just in the neighborhood.
Anything going on?

80
00:09:50,422 --> 00:09:52,757
No. He's just hanging out
with his granddaughter.

81
00:09:52,841 --> 00:09:54,718
Well, isn't that sweet?

82
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:56,929
Here, let me see.

83
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:38,720
It's a dead drop.

84
00:10:38,887 --> 00:10:40,180
- What?
- A dead drop.

85
00:10:40,347 --> 00:10:42,897
He just stashed something
underneath that trash can.

86
00:10:43,016 --> 00:10:46,061
Write the time down. Roll on it.

87
00:10:49,731 --> 00:10:51,942
Looks like he's leaving.

88
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:56,780
- Anybody coming for it?
- Nope, not that I can see.

89
00:10:56,947 --> 00:11:00,367
Nobody in sight. Could be hours.

90
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:02,035
Could be.

91
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,580
What do you want to do?

92
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:49,334
<i>It's not my fault that Murtha's got
his panties in a twist.</i>

93
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,836
<i>It's an HR issue, Janice.</i>

94
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:53,546
<i>I read the report.</i>

95
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:57,508
<i>I'm calling again because that's
the wrong case file number.</i>

96
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:00,345
<i>All right? I don't know what kind of
shoddy stan...</i>

97
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,057
<i>First off, Miracle Whip
is not mayonnaise, okay?</i>

98
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,523
<i>"Looks like it" doesn't equal
"tastes like it."</i>

99
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:10,688
<i>Secondly, every time it's like
they gotta slather an entire jar</i>

100
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:15,025
<i>- bastard's screwing with us now.
- How'd he make you? What'd you do?</i>

101
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,027
<i>We honked our horns
and yelled "yoo-hoo."</i>

102
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:20,071
<i>What do you mean, what did we do?
This guy is slippery as hell.</i>

103
00:12:20,155 --> 00:12:22,241
<i>He's been throwing every tail
we put on him.</i>

104
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:27,038
<i>- The guy's a pro.
- Yeah, well, even pros make mistakes.</i>

105
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:30,875
<i>One of these days,
our pal Ehrmantraut's gonna slip up.</i>

106
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:33,503
<i>Just gotta be there when he does.</i>

107
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:41,552
Teenagers. Sometimes you
just want to strangle them.

108
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,473
How's it going?

109
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:51,062
Oh, you know. Well, this little munchkin,
I could just keep her forever.

110
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:54,649
She is just the sweetest
little baby ever born.

111
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,943
Yes, she is.

112
00:12:58,193 --> 00:13:00,530
I don't see much of Flynn.

113
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:03,074
That car of his keeps him pretty busy.

114
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:04,659
Yeah.

115
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:08,830
More importantly, how are you doing?

116
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,289
I'm okay.

117
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,333
How's the therapy?

118
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:18,756
I know Dave helped me so much
when I was going through my little...

119
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,717
How's your guy?

120
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:21,884
- Peter.
- Peter.

121
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,262
He's... Yeah, he's good.

122
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:27,432
I feel like I'm making progress.

123
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:29,350
That's great.

124
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:34,063
You know,
you just keep working through it.

125
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:43,281
Honey. Babe, what is it?

126
00:13:44,239 --> 00:13:46,451
It's okay. It's all right.

127
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:49,703
Why don't you let me take Holly,
and then we'll talk about this?

128
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:51,497
- No.
- Okay. All right, that's fine.

129
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:53,791
Then how about you just talk to me?

130
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,877
Just tell me what's going on.

131
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:57,462
I just...

132
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:01,466
I need to make the right decision.

133
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,551
I need them to be safe.

134
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:05,762
The kids?

135
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:09,515
They're safe. Of course they are.

136
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,101
I just miss them so much.

137
00:14:12,267 --> 00:14:13,895
I just want to be with them.

138
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:16,981
Hey, you know we can bring
them back home anytime you want.

139
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:21,110
No. They need to stay. But I just...

140
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,615
I don't know what to do here. I...

141
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,702
Like, whatever I choose is wrong.

142
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:35,416
Skyler, you gotta tell me
what's going on.

143
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,587
I know sometimes you...

144
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:44,467
I know you think
I have a big mouth sometimes. I...

145
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:50,139
But if you felt like you couldn't
talk to me, I don't know what I'd do.

146
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:55,812
Okay. So, what's this about
the kids not being safe?

147
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:59,315
Safe from what?

148
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,235
From us.

149
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:05,404
From Walt and me.

150
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,908
Like what? Like you're bad parents?

151
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:12,829
Because you're not. Not even close.

152
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,581
Marie

153
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:19,043
there are things you just don't know

154
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,128
that if you knew

155
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:25,132
you'd never speak to me again.

156
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,136
Try me.

157
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:40,314
Okay, if you're not gonna say it, I will.

158
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:43,651
Skyler, you have
to forgive yourself for Ted.

159
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:47,446
- What?
- You can't keep beating yourself up

160
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:51,117
over some stupid little affair.

161
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:55,628
- Walt told you.
- Please don't blame him.

162
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:59,041
I practically forced him to,
and I wasn't gonna say anything.

163
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,879
But I cannot stand to watch you
torture yourself like this.

164
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,047
You have to forgive yourself, Skyler.

165
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,341
You were having all these problems
with Walt.

166
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:10,094
And Ted is a really good-looking man.

167
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:14,974
You're only human.
Hell, I've even thought of, you know...

168
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:20,813
I mean, not seriously,
but I totally get your temptation.

169
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:23,274
Yeah.

170
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:30,114
Doesn't it feel good
to get it off your chest?

171
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:33,451
Oh, yeah.

172
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:37,413
- I feel better.
- Yeah.

173
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,714
<i>For those who love the taste
but not the price</i>

174
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:50,092
<i>there's simulated caviar made of kelp,
a type of seaweed.</i>

175
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:56,557
<i>A fraction of the cost, it looks, smells
and tastes similar to the real thing.</i>

176
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,142
Ready to get back at it?

177
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,229
<i>Unlike fish caviar...</i>

178
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,649
{\an8}<i>We have breaking news into our newsroom.</i>

179
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:07,609
<i>We've just learned
police are now expanding their search,</i>

180
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,863
<i>for a missing McKinley County boy
after four days with no leads.</i>

181
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:14,951
<i>Fourteen-year-old Drew Sharp was last
seen by his parents Thursday morning.</i>

182
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:17,417
<i>Authorities are extending
their search today</i>

183
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:20,498
<i>east from Crownpoint
to Hospah and Whitehorse.</i>

184
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:24,752
<i>Sharp was last seen riding his dirt bike
into the desert behind his house.</i>

185
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:27,171
<i>Investigators are asking any...</i>

186
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:39,141
Jesse, nothing can change this.

187
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:44,313
- Yeah, it's just that kid's parents...
- I know. Believe me.

188
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:49,443
I haven't been able to sleep the
past few nights just thinking about it.

189
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:54,240
But, Jesse, now,
finally, we're self-sufficient.

190
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,408
Finally we have everything that we need,

191
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:59,870
and no one to answer to except ourselves.

192
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,749
And in a year, a year and a half

193
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:07,085
once we've cooked through this
methylamine and made our money

194
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:11,424
there will be plenty of time
for soul-searching. Until then

195
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,093
we keep going.

196
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,847
And we run our business our way,

197
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:21,809
and make sure
that this never happens again.

198
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:25,187
Okay?

199
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:27,606
Look.

200
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,359
Listen, I'll finish this up.

201
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:33,029
Why don't you go on home?

202
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:36,240
- You sure?
- Absolutely.

203
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:38,868
Yeah. I'll take care of this.

204
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:43,914
You go on.

205
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,374
Hey.

206
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:31,128
Yeah, I was just leaving.

207
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,131
All right.

208
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:02,201
Hello? Walter?

209
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,495
What are you doing here?

210
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:07,581
I'm delivering the batch.
What are you doing here?

211
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:12,461
Might as well get this over with.
Come in. Join us.

212
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:21,053
- Hey.
- Hi.

213
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,057
Where's your cars?

214
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,685
We parked around the block.

215
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:31,063
You might consider doing that as well.

216
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,151
Okay.

217
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:46,954
So, what's going on?

218
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:51,333
Just since this morning,
I threw three separate tails. All DEA.

219
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,418
- What?
- The feds have been all over me.

220
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:56,297
This has been going on for a while now.

221
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,923
Did they follow you here?

222
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,050
No. I said I threw them.

223
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:03,595
I would never come to the headquarters
of our illegal meth operation

224
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,514
dragging a bunch of cops, Walter.

225
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:08,100
- It would be unwise.
- How can you be so sure?

226
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:12,146
Well, I've been doing this a long time.
It's pretty basic stuff.

227
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:14,914
How long has this been going on?

228
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:17,902
Since about the time we started
this little venture.

229
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:21,572
The DEA, in particular your peach
of a brother-in-law

230
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:24,283
has taken a keen interest
in my activities.

231
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,744
And you're just telling me this now?

232
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:29,830
What, you didn't think this information
would be of interest?

233
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:32,666
- Wouldn't be germane?
- I've been handling it, Walter.

234
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,961
We're sitting on a thousand gallons
of stolen methylamine.

235
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,130
Jesus.
How can you be so irresponsible?

236
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,882
Calm down, would you, please?

237
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:43,593
I can't believe you kept this from me.
From us. Did you know about this?

238
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:46,096
- Mike just told me.
- And I said calm down.

239
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:49,058
- I've got it under control.
- Oh, well, forgive me,

240
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:51,769
for not having complete confidence.

241
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:55,105
- You know this can't go on, right?
- Yeah, I know.

242
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:57,816
And I've already decided.

243
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:00,402
I'm out.

244
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:12,206
Okay. Well...

245
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,876
Sorry to see you go, Mike.

246
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,420
But I really don't see any other way.

247
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:20,047
Neither do I.

248
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:21,632
Obviously, Jesse

249
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:25,344
you'll have to take over
the distribution end of things.

250
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:30,599
Mike, I trust that you'll bring Jesse up
to speed on your side of the business?

251
00:22:30,765 --> 00:22:33,560
Yeah, about that...

252
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:36,563
Actually, Mr. White

253
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:40,317
I'm out too.

254
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,779
You're what?

255
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:49,784
I don't think I can do this anymore.

256
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:51,912
So

257
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,623
I'm retiring, I guess.

258
00:22:54,789 --> 00:22:58,793
That methylamine that we stole, that we
nearly killed ourselves trying to steal?

259
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:04,300
That methylamine, when cooked,
is worth nearly $300 million.

260
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:07,845
And you're telling me that you're willing
to walk away from that?

261
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:09,930
We're walking away from the meth.

262
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,432
Not the methylamine.

263
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:14,476
Jesse and I will be taking
our two-thirds and selling it.

264
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,885
I've got a connection,
a guy I knew from my time with Fring.

265
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:22,026
This guy has the capital,
and he's motivated. Highly.

266
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:25,404
Mike's thinking we'll clear
like 5 million. Each.

267
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:28,866
I'll pay off my guys in lock-up
out of my share.

268
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:33,329
And those legacy costs you're so fond of
you won't have to worry about anymore.

269
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,998
And then I will be going on my way.

270
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:37,499
Jesse too.

271
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:41,003
It's a solid plan.

272
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:44,256
You can come in on this with us.

273
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,300
That'd be cool.

274
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:51,305
Course, you know,
you are free to hold onto your third,

275
00:23:51,472 --> 00:23:53,640
and keep cooking.

276
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:00,814
You'll be selling to my competitors.

277
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:03,442
This guy and his crew
are way out in Phoenix.

278
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:06,111
It's a big country, Walter.

279
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,697
Whole lot of meth-heads.

280
00:24:08,863 --> 00:24:11,492
Pennies on the dollar, Jesse.

281
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:13,994
And that's what you're
gonna sell out for?

282
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:17,206
Pennies? Why?

283
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:20,292
Five million isn't pennies.

284
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,259
It's more money than I've ever seen.

285
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:25,130
And when it comes down to it

286
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,591
are we in the meth business,

287
00:24:27,758 --> 00:24:29,927
or the money business?

288
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:45,818
Relax, kid. There's no one there.

289
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:47,779
You sure?

290
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:50,656
I wouldn't be here if I wasn't.

291
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:22,063
Glad to see you could make it out.

292
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,440
I was surprised to get your call.

293
00:25:24,607 --> 00:25:26,651
Good surprise, I hope.

294
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:29,904
There's one gallon, as discussed.

295
00:25:30,071 --> 00:25:32,573
You take that back home
to your people, test it.

296
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:36,244
If you're satisfied,
I can get the other 665.

297
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:37,912
All right. That's fair enough.

298
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:39,872
Shall we talk money?

299
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:42,208
That one's free.

300
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:45,086
The price for the rest is 15,000 per.

301
00:25:45,253 --> 00:25:50,007
Six hundred and sixty-five gallons,
that's 9,975,000.

302
00:25:50,675 --> 00:25:53,261
Although I would prefer
you round it up to 10.

303
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:56,722
Makes it easier for my partner
and I to split.

304
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:57,932
Steep.

305
00:26:00,101 --> 00:26:01,769
We good?

306
00:26:02,687 --> 00:26:06,231
I'll talk to my guys, but I should be able
to put together that cash, yeah.

307
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:07,400
Good.

308
00:26:07,942 --> 00:26:12,446
I gotta tell you, this is worth it just to
get that blue stuff of yours off the market.

309
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:19,745
The blue stuff will be off the market,
right?

310
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:28,045
Now, this whole time, I was thinking 666

311
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:31,090
that seems like an odd number.

312
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:33,133
Two-thirds of an even thousand, though.

313
00:26:33,217 --> 00:26:37,555
When I look at it that way,
it starts to make sense to me.

314
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:40,182
That's not all the methylamine, is it?

315
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:44,979
You two have a partner
you haven't mentioned?

316
00:26:46,063 --> 00:26:49,609
This other party
wouldn't be a problem for you.

317
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:52,945
- His territory won't impact yours.
- See, that doesn't work for me.

318
00:26:53,029 --> 00:26:56,699
I'm not just buying this for the supply.
I'm buying this for the demand.

319
00:26:56,866 --> 00:26:58,868
I'm looking to increase my market share.

320
00:26:59,035 --> 00:27:01,037
Well, I don't know what to tell you.

321
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:05,166
I want you to tell me
that Fring's blue will be off the streets.

322
00:27:10,087 --> 00:27:14,258
All right.
Here's a new deal for you then.

323
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:18,971
I'll pay you 15K a gallon
for the full thousand gallons.

324
00:27:19,347 --> 00:27:21,390
Not a drop less.

325
00:27:23,517 --> 00:27:26,020
It's not mine to sell, Declan.

326
00:27:26,187 --> 00:27:29,148
Well, then, no deal, Mike.

327
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:53,965
Yes?

328
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:58,719
Yes. I guess.

329
00:28:00,638 --> 00:28:02,556
I don't know.

330
00:28:02,723 --> 00:28:04,976
Why don't you come over here?

331
00:28:06,102 --> 00:28:07,979
To my house.

332
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:11,565
Yes, seriously.

333
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:20,032
Hey.

334
00:28:25,913 --> 00:28:28,749
Yo, you sure this is okay?

335
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:31,460
She's not here. Nobody's here.

336
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:35,589
All right. So...

337
00:28:36,716 --> 00:28:37,967
Something's come up.

338
00:28:38,134 --> 00:28:40,636
Mike wanted to come here
to give you the hard sell,

339
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,724
but I figured it'd be better
coming from me.

340
00:28:45,266 --> 00:28:47,893
Mike's connection won't buy
mine and Mike's shares

341
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,855
of the methylamine
unless he gets your share too.

342
00:28:51,022 --> 00:28:53,983
He wants the entire thousand gallons.

343
00:28:54,442 --> 00:28:56,485
Absolutely not.

344
00:28:57,028 --> 00:28:59,488
Yeah, I figured you'd say that.

345
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:03,409
But I've been thinking about it,

346
00:29:03,576 --> 00:29:05,202
and it really makes sense.

347
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:07,788
- Kind of.
- It does, does it?

348
00:29:08,706 --> 00:29:11,333
Look, when you started this thing

349
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,170
did you ever dream of having $5 million?

350
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:16,255
I know for a fact that you didn't.

351
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:20,634
I know for a fact all you needed
was 737,000

352
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:23,846
because you worked it all out,
like, mathematically.

353
00:29:24,555 --> 00:29:28,455
Look, if selling the methylamine now
means that no one else ever gets killed

354
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,353
then I vote for that, man.
Hands down.

355
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,189
And we could have it tomorrow.

356
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:35,941
We would be out.
You could spend time with your family.

357
00:29:36,025 --> 00:29:39,611
No more worrying about them getting
hurt or finding out about everything.

358
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:41,613
Isn't this what you've been working for?

359
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:44,197
I have not been working this hard
just to sell out.

360
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:47,912
- It's not selling out.
- Yes, it is, Jesse.

361
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:52,458
I have... We have suffered and bled,
literally, for this business.

362
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:56,128
And I will not throw it away for nothing.

363
00:29:56,879 --> 00:30:00,299
I don't know how else to say it,
Mr. White.

364
00:30:00,466 --> 00:30:04,345
Five million dollars isn't nothing.

365
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:09,350
Jesse, have you heard of a company
called Gray Matter?

366
00:30:10,351 --> 00:30:13,562
- No.
- Well, I co-founded it

367
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:16,232
in grad school
with a couple of friends of mine.

368
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:18,692
Actually, I was the one who named it.

369
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:21,528
And back then, it was just...
Oh, it was just small-time.

370
00:30:21,612 --> 00:30:23,697
We had a couple patents pending.

371
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:26,242
But nothing earth-shattering.

372
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:29,870
Course, we all knew the potential.

373
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:33,916
Yeah, we were gonna take
the world by storm.

374
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:38,671
And then this...

375
00:30:38,838 --> 00:30:41,757
Well, something happened
between the three of us.

376
00:30:41,924 --> 00:30:45,219
And I'm not gonna go into detail.

377
00:30:45,386 --> 00:30:49,306
But for personal reasons,
I decided to leave the company.

378
00:30:49,807 --> 00:30:52,643
And I sold my share to my two partners.

379
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:56,438
I took a buyout for $5000.

380
00:30:56,605 --> 00:31:00,526
Now, at the time,
that was a lot of money for me.

381
00:31:01,944 --> 00:31:04,321
Care to guess what that company
is worth now?

382
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:07,283
Millions?

383
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,661
Billions, with a "B."

384
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:14,874
Two-point-one-six billion
as of last Friday.

385
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,459
I look it up every week.

386
00:31:17,751 --> 00:31:20,462
And I sold my share

387
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:25,467
my potential, for $5000.

388
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:30,723
I sold my kids' birthright
for a few months' rent.

389
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:33,392
This isn't the same thing.

390
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:39,064
Jesse, you asked me

391
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:43,027
if I was in the meth business
or the money business.

392
00:31:43,194 --> 00:31:44,904
Neither.

393
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:48,115
I'm in the empire business.

394
00:31:53,162 --> 00:31:54,955
I don't know.

395
00:31:55,623 --> 00:32:01,879
Mr. White, is a meth empire
really something to be that proud of?

396
00:32:15,351 --> 00:32:17,144
Skyler, you remember Jesse.

397
00:32:17,645 --> 00:32:19,688
Jesse, this is my wife, Skyler.

398
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:22,441
Hey, Mrs. White. Good to see you.

399
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:24,944
You have a lovely home.

400
00:32:25,152 --> 00:32:27,904
- I was just heading out.
- Why don't you stay for dinner?

401
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:30,783
- No, Mr. White. I'm gonna go.
- Stay.

402
00:32:31,575 --> 00:32:34,078
Come on. It'll be fun.

403
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,872
It's okay with us, isn't it, Skyler?

404
00:32:36,956 --> 00:32:40,042
We don't have anything special
planned tonight.

405
00:32:43,254 --> 00:32:44,463
Yeah.

406
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:46,966
Sure.

407
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:51,720
Why not?

408
00:32:54,348 --> 00:32:56,058
See?

409
00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:21,375
These are great green beans,
Mrs. White.

410
00:33:21,542 --> 00:33:25,629
I like that you got
the slivered almonds going.

411
00:33:25,796 --> 00:33:28,590
My mom always made them like that.

412
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:30,175
You put lemon in there too?

413
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:36,056
They are from the deli at Albertsons.

414
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:41,353
Well

415
00:33:42,062 --> 00:33:45,774
you know, good work
on your shopping then.

416
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:49,403
Because these are choice.

417
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,796
I eat a lot of frozen stuff.

418
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:10,799
It's usually pretty bad.

419
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:13,468
I mean, the pictures
are always so awesome, you know?

420
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:16,263
It's like, "Hell, yeah,
I'm stoked for this lasagna."

421
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:19,850
And then you nuke it,
and the cheese gets all scabby on top,

422
00:34:20,017 --> 00:34:22,436
and it's like you're eating a scab.

423
00:34:22,603 --> 00:34:24,730
I mean, seriously, what's that about?

424
00:34:24,897 --> 00:34:28,942
It's like, yo, whatever happened
to truth in advertising?

425
00:34:30,027 --> 00:34:31,779
You know?

426
00:34:42,122 --> 00:34:44,541
Yeah, it's bad.

427
00:34:48,212 --> 00:34:51,048
So, hey, how's business?

428
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:56,136
The car wash.
Mr. White said it's going really well.

429
00:34:56,303 --> 00:34:59,515
Says, like, you're a great manager.

430
00:35:00,766 --> 00:35:02,810
He did, huh?

431
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:05,937
Yeah, he says you've
got it running like a...

432
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:09,191
Like a machine. Like, well-oiled.

433
00:35:09,358 --> 00:35:10,984
Yeah.

434
00:35:14,405 --> 00:35:17,366
What else did he tell you about me?

435
00:35:18,117 --> 00:35:21,078
Oh, you know, just good stuff.

436
00:35:21,245 --> 00:35:24,123
Just really, you know,
really good, good stuff.

437
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:27,000
We don't really talk that much about

438
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:32,047
you know, personal things.

439
00:35:34,216 --> 00:35:37,594
Did you also tell him about my affair?

440
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:58,657
May I please be excused?

441
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,340
You know my kids are gone?

442
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:17,050
Thank God.

443
00:36:18,385 --> 00:36:21,096
No. I don't mean
they're out for the night.

444
00:36:21,472 --> 00:36:25,476
They're gone.
They're staying with my in-laws.

445
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:28,687
She made me kick
my own kids out of the house.

446
00:36:34,485 --> 00:36:36,778
She told me

447
00:36:37,362 --> 00:36:42,910
that she was counting the days
until my cancer came back.

448
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:48,790
My wife is waiting for me to die.

449
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:55,214
This business is all I have left now.

450
00:36:59,927 --> 00:37:01,970
It's all I have.

451
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:08,727
And you want to take it away from me.

452
00:37:32,376 --> 00:37:35,170
I thought you might try something stupid.

453
00:37:35,629 --> 00:37:38,090
- Look, Mike...
- Don't bother, Walter.

454
00:37:38,257 --> 00:37:40,384
Come join me in the office.

455
00:37:42,803 --> 00:37:44,263
I don't think so.

456
00:37:45,514 --> 00:37:47,766
That's not a request.

457
00:37:51,937 --> 00:37:56,150
Might as well get comfortable.
This deal's going down tomorrow.

458
00:37:56,316 --> 00:37:59,069
It's happening, and there's nothing
you can do to stop it.

459
00:37:59,153 --> 00:38:01,321
- Got it?
- So it's okay for you to steal my...

460
00:38:01,405 --> 00:38:03,699
To ensure that, you and I are gonna spend

461
00:38:03,866 --> 00:38:06,952
the rest of the night together
in this office.

462
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:09,371
- Like it's my birthday.
- Mike...

463
00:38:09,538 --> 00:38:12,624
When the deal is done,
you'll get your money. I guarantee that.

464
00:38:12,708 --> 00:38:16,670
Let me cook it.
I'll double your five and you still walk.

465
00:38:16,837 --> 00:38:20,591
You know, I have never seen anybody
work so hard not to get $5 million.

466
00:38:20,758 --> 00:38:22,300
Mike, you need to listen to me.

467
00:38:22,384 --> 00:38:27,681
No, Walter. The last thing I need to do
is listen to you. Now, sit down.

468
00:39:00,339 --> 00:39:01,965
All right.

469
00:39:02,132 --> 00:39:04,635
Walter, I've got a bit
of a quandary here.

470
00:39:04,802 --> 00:39:08,597
I've got something I need to attend to
before this deal happens.

471
00:39:08,764 --> 00:39:12,684
But for some reason, I don't trust you
alone with the methylamine.

472
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:16,355
I'm gonna have to restrain you.

473
00:39:16,897 --> 00:39:18,482
You gotta be kidding.

474
00:39:18,649 --> 00:39:21,360
Stand up for me, please.

475
00:39:21,527 --> 00:39:23,278
Stand up.

476
00:39:24,822 --> 00:39:27,032
Turn around for me.

477
00:39:27,449 --> 00:39:30,119
Arms out to the side. Up.

478
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:47,803
- Oh, man.
- Sit down.

479
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:50,931
Sit down.

480
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:55,894
Give me your wrist.

481
00:40:03,569 --> 00:40:04,778
Sorry.

482
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:57,075
Alrighty.
To what do we owe the pleasure?

483
00:42:57,242 --> 00:43:02,622
Well, gentlemen, we're here to discuss
your illegal harassment of my client.

484
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:04,207
This should be good.

485
00:43:04,374 --> 00:43:08,587
Mr. Ehrmantraut has become
the subject of a vicious, relentless,

486
00:43:08,754 --> 00:43:12,799
and unwarranted DEA persecution.

487
00:43:12,966 --> 00:43:17,471
- Gomie, does that sound right to you?
- I have no idea what he's talking about.

488
00:43:17,637 --> 00:43:19,389
Play it as cool as you like, Fonzie.

489
00:43:19,473 --> 00:43:22,726
But we all know you've been following
my client day and night.

490
00:43:22,893 --> 00:43:25,687
The man can't spend a few minutes
with his granddaughter

491
00:43:25,771 --> 00:43:28,148
without you guys quivering in the bushes,

492
00:43:28,315 --> 00:43:33,695
and peeping through your binoculars.
It's... Well, it's disturbing.

493
00:43:33,862 --> 00:43:38,533
And it's taken a toll on his mental
and physical well-being.

494
00:43:39,284 --> 00:43:40,744
Your client looks fine to me.

495
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:45,082
Well, some hurts only show on the inside.

496
00:43:46,041 --> 00:43:49,211
Now, you guys don't even have
warrants for these tails, do you?

497
00:43:49,378 --> 00:43:54,174
Theoretically, these tails you refer to
would be within the bounds of the law.

498
00:43:54,341 --> 00:43:58,052
Don't need a warrant to follow somebody
through a public place. Theoretically.

499
00:43:58,136 --> 00:44:01,056
Yeah, that is theoretically correct.

500
00:44:01,223 --> 00:44:05,352
However, I would counter that an
open-ended, unrestricted surveillance

501
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:09,106
like this amounts to stalking.

502
00:44:09,272 --> 00:44:10,857
Which is illegal.

503
00:44:11,024 --> 00:44:13,609
Now, I don't know what it is
you find so interesting

504
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:16,196
about my client,
and I'm not here to judge.

505
00:44:16,363 --> 00:44:20,700
Different strokes and all.
But sadly, he's just not that into you.

506
00:44:20,867 --> 00:44:24,037
So I have filed for a temporary
restraining order

507
00:44:24,204 --> 00:44:29,584
against the DEA
on behalf of Mr. Ehrmantraut.

508
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:33,713
Where'd you get your law degree, Goodman?

509
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:36,800
The same clown college you got that suit?

510
00:44:36,967 --> 00:44:39,803
You know who likes this suit?
Judge Papadoumian.

511
00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:41,721
She thinks I'm a snappy dresser.

512
00:44:41,888 --> 00:44:43,788
You know what Judge Papadoumian hates?

513
00:44:43,932 --> 00:44:47,894
Police harassment of a senior citizen.

514
00:44:48,353 --> 00:44:49,980
Sorry.

515
00:44:50,147 --> 00:44:52,147
Expect a visit from the sheriff, agents.

516
00:44:52,232 --> 00:44:55,652
You should have your ex parte
within the hour.

517
00:44:56,611 --> 00:44:58,238
Let's go.

518
00:45:06,455 --> 00:45:08,456
<i>What kind of judge
would issue this thing?</i>

519
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:11,959
<i>Papadoumian, man.
She's like Ho Chi Minh.</i>

520
00:45:12,127 --> 00:45:13,545
<i>So, what do we do?</i>

521
00:45:13,712 --> 00:45:17,215
<i>Well, not a lot of choice, you know?
We back off.</i>

522
00:45:17,382 --> 00:45:20,844
<i>For the moment. TRO won't stand up
and Goodman knows it.</i>

523
00:45:21,011 --> 00:45:25,015
<i>I don't see what they're playing at here,
but if Ehrmantraut wants a fight</i>

524
00:45:25,182 --> 00:45:27,476
<i>- he's gonna get one.
- All right.</i>

525
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:29,977
- That was a hell of a gamble.
- Worked.

526
00:45:30,395 --> 00:45:32,772
Yeah, well, not for long.

527
00:45:32,939 --> 00:45:36,485
And he's right about that TRO.
It's gonna get tossed <i>tout de suite.</i>

528
00:45:36,651 --> 00:45:40,279
Meanwhile, Schrader's hard-on for you
just reached Uncle Miltie proportions.

529
00:45:40,363 --> 00:45:41,948
So have fun with that.

530
00:45:42,115 --> 00:45:44,326
How much time I got?

531
00:45:44,868 --> 00:45:47,329
Maybe 24 hours.

532
00:45:47,496 --> 00:45:48,788
It's enough.

533
00:45:48,955 --> 00:45:52,166
It better be. Whatever you got planned,
you best pull the ripcord

534
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:54,252
while you still have a chance.

535
00:46:07,766 --> 00:46:09,184
- Where is it?
- Mike...

536
00:46:09,351 --> 00:46:10,701
- Mike!
- Get out of my way.

537
00:46:10,852 --> 00:46:13,855
- You sit down.
- Mike! Mike! Hold on, okay?

538
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:16,649
- I am gonna count to three.
- Mr. White's got an idea.

539
00:46:16,733 --> 00:46:18,818
- I'm serious. It's a great idea.
- One. Two.

540
00:46:18,902 --> 00:46:22,822
Look, you get your 5 million, we both do,
and he gets his methylamine, all right?

541
00:46:22,906 --> 00:46:24,699
Just hear him out.

542
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:31,623
Is that true, Walter?

543
00:46:35,835 --> 00:46:38,004
Everybody wins.
