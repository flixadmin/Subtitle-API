1
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,688
Oh, wow!

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,924
You really did it this time, Barry.

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,326
- Seriously?
- Yeah. Yeah.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,760
Yeah, seriously.

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,968
You come to Star City,
you ask for my help,

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,931
and then, inevitably, immediately,
we end up up the creek.

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,650
- Yeah, okay, that's fair.
- Thank you.

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,126
- They're moving in.
- On three, Team Leader.

9
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,123
- What's that?
- That would be heat vision.

10
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,211
- Three.
- Okay.

11
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,042
Kid gets faster every time we test him.

12
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,409
- Mach two.
- Already?

13
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,805
He just got his speed a few days ago.
How are his vitals?

14
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,202
His running economy, lactate threshold

15
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,402
are all way above expected levels.

16
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,961
Think we might have
a little prodigy on our hands.

17
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,571
Like, a Wizard of Whiz...

18
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,087
Guys, I don't want Wally
thinking that he's Barry,

19
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:09,450
rushing off half-cocked,
trying to take down Alchemy or Savitar

20
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,881
- <i>the next time one of them shows up.</i>
- Okay, but, guys,

21
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,050
Wally's not like me,
he doesn't want his powers gone.

22
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,129
We're gonna have a hard time
convincing him not to use them.

23
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,721
Yeah, well, we have to until he's ready.

24
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,367
- How?
- By convincing him that he isn't.

25
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,725
That means no encouraging him,
no training him,

26
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,001
and, you,

27
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,405
no talking to him about his suit.

28
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,602
Please, it's for his own good.

29
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,565
Why the hell not, it's just another lie
between friends, right?

30
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,250
Cisco...

31
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,284
What? Still not good?

32
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,361
Um, I think, maybe
we should try again tomorrow.

33
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,005
I can run a few more tests.

34
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,970
That was amazing.
Dinner's on me, whatever you want.

35
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,011
H.R.: <i>Test, test.
Fellow S.T.A.R. Labs employees,</i>

36
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,966
<i>your presence in the cortex
would be greatly appreciated.</i>

37
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,242
That's tonight? His presentation?

38
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,043
Great.

39
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,681
What do you think if after,

40
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,281
maybe we get a drink? You, me, Barry?

41
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,091
Barry?

42
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,608
We're just gonna get drinks,
pretend like we're friends?

43
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,248
Nice try. Ain't gonna happen.

44
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,531
BARRY: <i>You wanna open S.T.A.R. Labs
to the public?</i>

45
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,011
- In two weeks?
- Soft open,

46
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,885
not a hard open. But you know,
I'll use your input, all right?

47
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,162
Right now, it's very important
'cause the clock is ticking.

48
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,445
My vision is set to include, but
not limited to, bam,

49
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,366
a personal transportation
tour of the facility.

50
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,285
Or, for the faint of heart, we have, pow,

51
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,761
<i>a Virtual Reality alternative.</i>

52
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,964
Both set to include "Particle Vision!"

53
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,488
"Particle Vision?"

54
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,081
"Particle Vision,"
which is a moment-to-moment

55
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,290
reenactment of
the Particle Accelerator explosion,

56
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,244
but seen from the point of...

57
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,010
- Particle...
- H.R.: <i>the particle!</i>

58
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,962
Listen, H.R., I know that you're trying
to figure out how you add value

59
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,970
- to the team, I get it, but this...
- Let me stop you right there, B.A.

60
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,003
- Okay, don't call me "B.A."
- I can make S.T.A.R. Labs

61
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,249
the powerhouse in the scientific community
that it once was,

62
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,771
and moreover, earn back

63
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,645
the people's trust. Look at you guys.

64
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,121
You just, you're faces are so darn gloomy.

65
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,846
Here's what we'll do,
I'm gonna make you guys a...

66
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,211
Was that, was that the satellite?
I hope that wasn't the satellite.

67
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,727
- Is that a meteor?
- Why, yes, that is a meteor,

68
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,321
and, yes, it is heading for downtown.

69
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,367
I gotta go.

70
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,485
- Guys.
- CISCO: <i>What is it?</i>

71
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,929
- <i>Barry, what do you see?</i>
- This isn't a meteor.

72
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,761
<i>Barry? Barry, come in. Can you hear me?</i>

73
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,041
Guys.

74
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,440
Oh, come on.

75
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,121
Aliens!

76
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,841
Government officials are reporting,
the mysterious object that crashed

77
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,724
in downtown, Central City,

78
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,249
was simply a DOD aircraft
on a routine training operation.

79
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,005
Thank you,
but we'll brief the White House.

80
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,846
You're not listening to me about this.
The intelligence we've gathered

81
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,485
- at A.R.G.U.S...
- Is not accurate.

82
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,250
We got this covered, Director Michaels.

83
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,484
Go back to Star City,
let the big guns take over.

84
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,571
Lyla, what is this?

85
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,729
- I saw the weird ship that crashed...
- You saw a ship?

86
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,208
- What else did you see?
- Enough to give Ridley Scott nightmares.

87
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,924
Meet me at S.T.A.R. Labs,
I'll tell you everything I know.

88
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,885
Aliens.

89
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,410
The <i>Alien</i> aliens or little green men?

90
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,931
Both. Sort of.

91
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,924
Since we learned of them,
we've been calling them the Dominators.

92
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,367
WALLY: <i>Okay, that is not the name of
a species that comes in peace.</i>

93
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,722
No, no, it, it's very aggressive.

94
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,044
So, how long have you guys known
about these "Dominators?"

95
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,362
- Since the '50s.
- That was them.

96
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,722
Redmond, Oregon,
the government tried to cover it up.

97
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,965
What? I watch SyFy channel.

98
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,561
In 1951, they appeared
under the same sort of circumstances.

99
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,201
A ship crash landed,
little to no communication.

100
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,643
We learned they were abducting humans
to gather intel about us.

101
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,485
<i>They attacked, and hundreds of soldiers
lost their lives.</i>

102
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,211
Then for some inexplicable reason,
they left.

103
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,206
All contact had been lost,

104
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,125
until three months ago
when the DOD received this.

105
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,642
ALIEN:
<i>We pose no threat,</i>

106
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,484
<i>human inhabitants.</i>

107
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,407
<i>Understanding is our purpose.</i>

108
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,887
<i>Any action against us,</i>

109
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,963
<i>as shown to us in the past,</i>

110
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,482
<i>will prompt swift retaliation.</i>

111
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,844
So, when we discovered four ships
heading towards Earth,

112
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,765
we were concerned
that it was happening all over again.

113
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,686
One of them, obviously, landed here.

114
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,526
Right. 'Cause we ain't got enough crazy
going on here in Central City.

115
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,649
- Do you know what they want?
- They've ignored all attempts

116
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,161
to communicate,
but we do know, just like before,

117
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,084
that the dropships
contained reconnaissance teams

118
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,964
sent here to gather more intel about us.

119
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,525
Looking for our weaknesses?

120
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,768
- We need to do something.
- LYLA: <i>We are.</i>

121
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,368
Nearly every member state in the UN
is in talks to coordinate a response.

122
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,522
- Action is being taken.
- So, wait,

123
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,125
you want us to just sit this one out?

124
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,322
These things are like <i>World War Z</i> zombies,

125
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,046
if they decide to attack,
no military can stop them.

126
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,486
Neither could you.

127
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,331
Not by yourself, anyway.

128
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,881
Just let us handle this for now.

129
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,010
I'll be in touch.

130
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,050
So, the plan isn't to just

131
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,521
- stay still and do nothing, right?
- No.

132
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,884
Barry, you heard Lyla,
you can't do this alone.

133
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,731
I don't plan to.

134
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,241
GREEN ARROW: Anything?

135
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,721
- Zilch.
- He's gotta be here somewhere.

136
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,245
<i>FELICITY: What are the chances
this guy just decided</i>

137
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,086
<i>that he'd had enough of this life?
You know, no health insurance?</i>

138
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,800
He's sick of the crazy hours.
I mean, bullets aren't actually that cheap

139
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,405
<i>and he loses them...</i>

140
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,364
- I'm sorry, man, I...
- It's okay.

141
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,765
Yeah...

142
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,208
- Hey.
- Hi, Barry.

143
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,250
- So, who was that guy?
- That

144
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,284
was Vigilante, and we nearly had him.

145
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,681
You nearly had him?

146
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,531
Ollie, it looked like
he was about to <i>Scarface</i> you guys just...

147
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,609
Barry, is there something
that I can do for you,

148
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,120
another evil speedster to help you with?

149
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,567
Uh, maybe, actually...
That's not why I'm here.

150
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,723
What was so urgent
you had to rush to Star City?

151
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,363
- Aliens.
- Aliens?

152
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,721
Aliens.

153
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,405
I swear to God, Barry,

154
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,444
my life was somewhat normal
before I met you.

155
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,121
Hey, I know, I mean, I'm sorry.
Look, okay, they're real,

156
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,647
and they're already here,
and from what Lyla told us,

157
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,291
it does not appear to be for peace.

158
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,085
- Oh, no.
- Lyla knows about this?

159
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,641
Lyla, yeah, she came to. Where you...

160
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,248
- I called Thea.
- Yeah, I, uh...

161
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,171
I came to have you sign this
before City Council went into mutiny,

162
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,323
but that can totally wait.

163
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,721
Count me in.

164
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,605
For what, I thought you retired?

165
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,286
Yeah, but it's...

166
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,926
It's aliens.

167
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,288
Oh, that is so cute.
You guys are just gonna

168
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,323
get together and go fight some aliens?

169
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,926
Have you lost your minds? They're aliens,

170
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,690
and there's only four of you.

171
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,843
Not if we get Stein and,

172
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,321
- you know, all the others.
- They're calling themselves "The Legends."

173
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,090
Egotistical, but catchy.

174
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,327
Do you know where they are?

175
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,920
I know where they were.

176
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,921
What is this place?

177
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,249
It's this old hall,

178
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:56,081
hangar thing that S.T.A.R. Labs owns,
or I guess, I own it.

179
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,526
Well, you should do something with it.

180
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,761
All right, so let me get this right.

181
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,327
Our, time-traveling buddies
in a flying time ship

182
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,681
are supposed to just pop up
right here, right?

183
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,850
Yeah, this is the time and place
I gave them,

184
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,963
so if they got my message,
they should be here...

185
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,361
Right now!

186
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,965
You know why I've never done drugs?

187
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,008
It's 'cause I was always afraid
I'd see weird stuff.

188
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,363
Okay, take everybody inside, all right?

189
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,005
And tell Oliver I'll be right back.

190
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,722
- Where you going?
- Well, since we're fighting aliens,

191
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,724
I figured we should get
one of our own, right?

192
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,570
- You found the right Earth?
- Tachyon device

193
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,723
tracked you on Earth-38 when you met her.

194
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,405
- So you should find her there.
- All right.

195
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,642
Just so you know, I'm only doing this
because we're on a mission.

196
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,282
I'm not gonna let my issues with you
get in the way of them.

197
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,291
This might take a few tries.

198
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,771
This better be the right place.

199
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,729
'Cause if this isn't the right place,

200
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,129
someone's about to be real confused.

201
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,605
- Barry!
- Hey.

202
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,565
I knew it. I knew that was you.

203
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,762
I knew it was you in that weird space.

204
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,122
Sorry, it took a couple of tries
to get here.

205
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,727
- This is my friend, Cisco.
- Well, friend is a loose term,

206
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,604
we work together. Hi. Cisco.

207
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,569
I have to say it, this

208
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,967
- is a nice universe you got here.
- Thank you.

209
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,725
Do you... Okay, do you remember last year,

210
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,129
when I helped you out and you
promised to do the same for me?

211
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,646
What are we up against?

212
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,324
Team Arrow is here.

213
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,485
Team Legends is here. Is that everyone?

214
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,807
I think so?

215
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,566
Nate and Amaya are back
watching The Waverider.

216
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,286
The newbies.

217
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,641
- That was cool.
- BARRY: <i>Guys!</i>

218
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,811
- Thanks for coming.
- Barry, I thought

219
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,122
- you were bringing an alien?
- And, yeah...

220
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,768
We did. Everybody, this is

221
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,769
my friend, Kara Danvers,

222
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,486
or as she's known on her Earth, Supergirl.

223
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,648
- What makes her so super?
- Well...

224
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,121
I'm convinced.

225
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,482
Best team-up ever!

226
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,689
Okay, I think I have this.

227
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,366
- Oliver?
- Green Arrow.

228
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,726
- Digg.
- Spartan.

229
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,485
- Thea.
- Speedy.

230
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,166
Okay. And, Sara?

231
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,966
- White Canary.
- Jax and Professor Stein?

232
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,565
Firestorm.

233
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,044
- Ray?
- Palmer, The Atom.

234
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,691
And, Mick.

235
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,046
Mmm?

236
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,844
Oh, Heat Wave.

237
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,525
Uh, and...

238
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,049
Iris, Caitlin, and Felicity.

239
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,401
Whoo! Yes!

240
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,606
And, you, you have cold powers
but you can't use them?

241
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,769
- You have powers?
- It's a long story.

242
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,891
Uh, Barry, so,

243
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,042
- Oliver Queen is the Green Arrow?
- Yeah.

244
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,208
- Oh, my God, he just got so much hotter.
- Oh, my God.

245
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,044
Okay, Cisco, we should probably
get started?

246
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,206
Okay.

247
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,251
These are the Dominators,

248
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,370
- we don't know much about them...
- Except, they're really strong.

249
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,566
I heard a lot of stories about them

250
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,569
when I was a kid, they came to my planet

251
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,850
before I was born, they did experiments
on a lot of people, killed a lot more.

252
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,731
Well, they're not the only ones
with super-human strength, I hear.

253
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,725
Barry says that you're more powerful
than a locomotive?

254
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,449
We should use Kara
as a stand-in for training.

255
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,768
Since when was Robin Hood
calling the shots?

256
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,600
What, I think, Mick is trying to say is,

257
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,650
it would be nice if we knew
who was in charge around here.

258
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,206
Maybe we should take a vote,

259
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,890
choose a leader. Someone we can all trust.

260
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,445
Well, I trust Oliver.

261
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,961
He's got my vote.

262
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,644
Appreciate that, Cisco, but Barry
put us all together, it should be him.

263
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,327
Fair enough.

264
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,081
Okay, um...

265
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,450
Cool, all right, well, I guess as
team leader, first thing to do

266
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,927
is start out by, um...

267
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,282
- Doing a test run.
- Let's do a test run, yeah.

268
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,720
Let's do a test run.

269
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,446
- Against Supergirl.
- Against Supergirl. All right?

270
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,290
- Test run against Supergirl.
- Are we just supposed to

271
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,450
- pretend like we don't hear him?
- So, just suit up.

272
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,444
Okay? Look alive, we're training
to fight aliens,

273
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,165
by fighting an alien, so...

274
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,450
- Do it. Just suit up.
- Stop.

275
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,126
What? Oliver, hey, Kara,

276
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,483
um, really quick. I was excited about
the two of you guys meeting each other.

277
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,688
Yeah, Oliver was the first person
to train me.

278
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,490
- Really? Well...
- Yeah.

279
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,921
- You did a really good job.
- It's 'cause I didn't hold back,

280
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,361
I shot him.

281
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,966
You can't hold back either.

282
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,164
He did shoot me.

283
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,646
Ouch, ah...

284
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,968
Okay. Um, are you sure about that?

285
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,930
I just met these people.

286
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,128
These people need to understand
this isn't gonna be easy.

287
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,440
Don't hold back, especially against me.

288
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,171
Yes, sir.

289
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,286
- Did he not like me?
- No, he's

290
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,360
like that with everyone, it's...
He'll warm up to you.

291
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,207
Old West dwarf star plus replicator
equals new suit.

292
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,841
You know what, Ray?
Maybe it's just me, but,

293
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,724
I think this thing's due for an update.

294
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,369
Ha! Yes, but after we
dominate the Dominators.

295
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,684
Oh! I see what you did there.

296
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,161
Hey-

297
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,689
Uh, listen, I gotta get to work,
Felicity is waiting for me,

298
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,405
but we'll talk about this later.

299
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,206
Hey, Barry.

300
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,565
Uh, where's Snart?

301
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,360
Oh, man, I'm sorry, Barry,

302
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,648
I forgot that we never told you.

303
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,886
What happened?

304
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,005
He sacrificed himself,

305
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,890
saved us all.

306
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,562
- He died a hero.
- A "Legend."

307
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,920
IRIS: <i>Wally, what are you doing here?</i>

308
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,766
You can't just show up and think
you're gonna train with everyone else.

309
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,048
- Why not?
- Because we need to test you more.

310
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,249
H.R. said that my results were great,
he said I'm good to go.

311
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,886
I don't care what H.R. said,
you are not ready.

312
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,525
- I am ready.
- Wally,

313
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,882
everyone here has been doing this
for a long time.

314
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,242
And this is gonna be
the hardest challenge they've faced.

315
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:25,288
Fighting Alchemy or Savitar, or aliens
isn't something you just show up and try.

316
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,088
If you screw up, you could die.

317
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,925
Do you get that?

318
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,881
Great.

319
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,764
Satellite's not picking up
anything abnormal.

320
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,921
No.

321
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,407
I don't know if we're gonna find
any Dominators this way.

322
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,810
Hey I, um...

323
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,169
Just... I couldn't help but notice
things are a little bit tense?

324
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,644
You don't need to be able
to "vibe" to figure that out.

325
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,281
Okay, so, apparently, it's, like, illegal

326
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,090
to be mad at Barry, but guess what,

327
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,607
he screws up just like the rest of us.

328
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,371
Yeah, and when he does,
he feels bad like the rest of us, too.

329
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,490
Felicity, he took it upon himself
to change the timeline.

330
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,769
And because of it, my brother

331
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,201
was killed.

332
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:11,010
So, there's no amount of feeling bad
that could ever make up for that.

333
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,169
Barry, before we start training
there's something you need to hear.

334
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,364
A message, that would be better
if we could share with you in private.

335
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,850
- All right, I'll step away.
- No, no, it's fine, you can stay.

336
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,168
All right. But no one else.

337
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,687
All right.

338
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,846
Let's make it quick.

339
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,208
OLD BARRY:
<i>A war is coming, Captain Hunter,</i>

340
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,563
<i>and at some point, you're gonna be
called back to Central City to fight it.</i>

341
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,643
<i>So you need to know
that while you and your team</i>

342
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,887
<i>have been in the temporal zone,</i>

343
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,162
<i>I made a choice
that affected the timeline.</i>

344
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,527
<i>As you know, whenever you alter the past,</i>

345
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,883
<i>those changes affect the present
and get compounded in the future.</i>

346
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,170
<i>When you return, you will be
in the new timeline I created,</i>

347
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,170
<i>where everyone's past and everyone's
future has been affected,</i>

348
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,169
<i>including yours. When you come back,</i>

349
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,328
<i>don't trust anything or anyone,</i>

350
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,686
<i>not even me.</i>

351
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,600
Where did you get that from?

352
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,048
We found it in a secret room
inside The Waverider.

353
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,004
It was sent by you, 40 years from now.

354
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,410
Forty years from now? Barry,
what the hell does this mean?

355
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,126
It means I screwed things up
when I changed the past.

356
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,125
- What did you do?
- I went back in time and

357
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,241
I saved my mom.

358
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,568
I created a timeline where she's alive.

359
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,725
It's called "Flashpoint,"
and I lived in it for a few months,

360
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,409
until I realized
that I made a big mistake,

361
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,523
and I tried to reset the timeline
to put things back

362
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,364
to how they were supposed to be but...

363
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,760
But it didn't Work?

364
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,881
No.

365
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,730
Wow, Barry, that's...

366
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,605
So, what's changed since you did this?

367
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,564
Cisco's brother is dead,

368
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,046
Caitlin has powers,

369
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,487
Diggle has a son now
instead of a daughter.

370
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,609
What? John had a daughter?

371
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,560
I didn't just screw up my life, man,
I screwed up everybody's lives,

372
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,768
and apparently
everybody's lives in the future.

373
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,889
I felt like, when these aliens got here,

374
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,885
that finally something had happened
I didn't cause, and maybe I could make up

375
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,407
for everything
I had done to everybody, but I...

376
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,922
I think we should be on the up and up
with everybody.

377
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,121
We gotta tell 'em.

378
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,403
We're going up against a bunch of aliens,
and you wanna tell people

379
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,767
that their lives might have been affected
by time travel?

380
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,410
One sci-fi problem at a time.

381
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,291
You made a mistake, Barry,

382
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,641
<i>it's part of the job.</i>

383
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,446
We can't deal with it today.

384
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,650
Professor Stein, are you okay?

385
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,887
MARTIN: <i>I'm not sure.</i>

386
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:04,003
Ms. Snow, would you mind
accompanying me to my home?

387
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,485
There's something I need to do.

388
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,121
Sure.

389
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,010
She really is a badass.

390
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,849
Yeah, it's kinda hot.

391
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,887
Let's go again.

392
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,050
So this is what,
your way of advising me to do nothing?

393
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:42,528
The Dominators have yet to engage
in an act of aggression, sir.

394
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,881
What does A.R.G.U.S. think?

395
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,084
I think us being passive is exactly
what they want, Mr. President.

396
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,687
Well, finally, someone here with balls.

397
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,601
Ike ignored all the signs
and waited until it was too late,

398
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,524
I'm not gonna make that same mistake.

399
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,371
You saw what happened
the last time we engaged them.

400
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,530
That's a lot of casualties
to be remembered for.

401
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,728
Four dropships landed on this planet,

402
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,684
all of them sent to gather intel.

403
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,848
If we do nothing and they attack,

404
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,250
that's what I'll be remembered for.

405
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,841
Proceed as instructed.

406
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,289
You know, Director Michaels,

407
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,771
the reason that Amanda Waller
lasted as long as she did

408
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,042
is because she learned
how to follow my lead.

409
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,762
I suggest that you acquire that trait.

410
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,406
Soon.

411
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,927
He's gone.

412
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,927
Traveler has been taken. I repeat,
Traveler has been taken.

413
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,765
The Dominators have the President.

414
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,361
- Hey, son.
- I don't understand, Dad.

415
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,163
No one in this family
wants me to have powers.

416
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,768
You don't, Barry doesn't, even Iris.

417
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,770
According to this,
everything is fine with me,

418
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,803
in fact everything is better than fine.

419
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,284
What, did you run back
to make sure I didn't see these?

420
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,611
I'm faster than you now, remember?

421
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,162
Whether you, or Barry,
or anyone likes it or not.

422
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,967
Wally, look, I know
you're upset with me, I was,

423
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,650
I was just trying to protect you.

424
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,843
Come on,
I know you don't want me training,

425
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,201
I just don't get why.

426
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,529
Because I'm better than Barry was
when he first got his speed.

427
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,006
You know, in Flashpoint,

428
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,646
you and I were a brother-sister
crime fighting unit.

429
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,841
So, it sucks you don't have
the same faith in me here

430
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,121
as you did there.

431
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,330
Brother and sister crime fighting unit.

432
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,326
Hi, there, Wallace.

433
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,320
Uh, I came back to get some... Lip balm.

434
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,330
It's okay, you seem to be the only one
that'll tell me the truth around here.

435
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,642
- Me?
- We're kinda treated the same way, right?

436
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,844
No one shows us any respect.

437
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,324
I'm... Respect, I'm just trying
to earn that, Wallace.

438
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,562
Well, maybe we should
stop listening to them.

439
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,490
Yeah. What, what does that mean?

440
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,251
It means I want you to train me.

441
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,766
Me?

442
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,840
I would be gone faster than humor
in a Liam Neeson movie,

443
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,365
- do you know what I mean?
- No.

444
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,046
- Yeah.
- Not if they don't find out.

445
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:43,250
- Wallace.
- Come on, no one's gonna do this for me.

446
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,684
I wanna make a difference, H.R.,

447
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,850
I'm never gonna be able to,
if I don't know how to use my powers.

448
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,445
Please, I wanna help people
same as you do.

449
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,681
So, show me how.

450
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,680
Nah.

451
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,250
Thank you for joining me, my dear.

452
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,683
Of course, I wasn't being
much help back there, anyway.

453
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,685
You know, having powers
isn't exactly a death sentence,

454
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,564
no matter who your doppelganger is.

455
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,884
I attacked my friends, my best friends.

456
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,202
And said horrible,
horrible things to them.

457
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,725
But, that wasn't you.

458
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,407
And, and believe me, as a person who

459
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,247
sometimes shares a body
with another human being,

460
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,608
I know the difference
and so do your friends.

461
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,485
I'm just so scared.

462
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,406
What if she comes back
and I can't keep her out. Then what?

463
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,730
We'll all be there for you.

464
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,161
Are you okay?

465
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,404
You're back!

466
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,244
I'm sorry, I was looking for my wife.

467
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,004
Very funny, she's not here.

468
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,240
It's so good to see you,
I missed you so much.

469
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,090
- Did you?
- Of course.

470
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,081
I love you, Dad.

471
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,604
I love you, too.

472
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,651
But I'm sorry, we have to...
We have to go.

473
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,650
Please tell your mother,
I'll see her soon.

474
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,604
- Professor Stein?
- We have to leave, now.

475
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,961
Where are you?

476
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,166
OLD BARRY:
<i>A war is coming, Captain Hunter...</i>

477
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,130
Are you sure you want me to keep going?

478
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,560
Yeah. Yes.

479
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,486
Just give us five minutes, please.

480
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,480
- Hey.
- Hey.

481
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,886
You know what this is?

482
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,685
This is really you.

483
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,005
Like, future you.

484
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,646
Come on, look.

485
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,560
You told them, right?

486
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,287
I'm gonna tell them, yeah,
when this is finished.

487
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,171
When this is finished.

488
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,045
Even though you're about to lead them
through an alien war?

489
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,685
Even after Flashpoint?

490
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:26,164
After everything you've messed up,
all the lives you've changed,

491
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,164
you still don't think
you should tell them?

492
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,526
Tell us what?

493
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,564
Uh, Jax and Professor Stein
found a message from me in the future

494
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,529
saying that, right now,
I can't be trusted.

495
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,207
And why would future you say that?

496
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:50,571
I think because I went back in time
and changed the timeline,

497
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,211
and now

498
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,006
things here are different
than before I left,

499
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,409
including some of your lives.

500
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,041
Some of our lives? Like who?

501
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,771
Cisco, Caitlin, Wally.

502
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,561
Digg.

503
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,528
Me? Why, what happened?

504
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,201
Hey.

505
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,570
Apparently, you had a daughter.

506
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,287
I had a daughter, Barry?

507
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:25,570
Baby John was Baby Sara.

508
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,561
So, what you...

509
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,563
Let me get this straight, you just, uh...

510
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,964
You just erased a daughter from my life?

511
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,409
- Yeah.
- Look, you can't go back

512
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,085
and just change things

513
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,765
- like that, Barry.
- I know.

514
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,890
Do you know how hard
it is for me to not alter events

515
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,650
to bring my sister back?

516
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:54,570
But I don't, because I know
the implications.

517
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,208
RAY: <i>And all those aberrations
we've spent the last eight months</i>

518
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,125
traveling through time trying to correct,

519
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,921
you just decided that it was okay
for you to create your own?

520
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,730
We should've told 'em before.

521
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,601
Guys.

522
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,808
Guys, it's Lyla, the President's
been abducted by the Dominators.

523
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,161
She needs us now.

524
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:17,090
Okay, you guys go, all right?
I'm gonna sit this one out, obviously.

525
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,601
You have Supergirl,
she's just as fast as I am.

526
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,849
<i>Get the President,
we can talk about this later.</i>

527
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,491
You still trust me, right?

528
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,603
I'll always trust you but...

529
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,650
It might take more to convince them.

530
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,927
- If you need me, I'll be there.
- Guys, this is... Hey!

531
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,807
This is crazy!

532
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,481
<i>Everyone is going, including Barry.</i>

533
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,323
I... I'm not going without him.

534
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,606
Then you'll be here, Oliver.

535
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,969
Okay, you know what, Oliver, it's okay.

536
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,288
I will go with them,
we'll get the President,

537
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,970
and, you stay here with Barry.

538
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,485
Sure we're in the right place?

539
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,721
Oh, this is the last place
the President's tracer gave a signal.

540
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,567
Must be nearby.

541
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,481
Yep,

542
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,409
- he's in there.
- How do you know that?

543
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,367
I can see him.

544
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,645
Oh, I have X-ray vision.

545
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,328
Oh, you can see everyone's bits
with those little peepers, huh?

546
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,045
- No. No, I...
- Ignore him.

547
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,329
How did you get the name Heat Wave?

548
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,524
I burned my family alive,
and I like to light things on fire.

549
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:45,041
Oh, well, that's a colorful backstory.

550
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,044
Well, my shrink thinks so.

551
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,165
By the way, I'm not gonna
call you Supergirl.

552
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,727
- It's stupid.
- You could call me Kara.

553
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,526
That won't work either.

554
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,568
Well, what are you gonna shout
if you need my help?

555
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,563
- Skirt.
- Seriously?

556
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,926
Seriously.

557
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,050
And I'm not gonna need your help.

558
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,770
SPARTAN: <i>Look, the President!</i>

559
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,927
Get me out of here.

560
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,607
- This doesn't feel right.
- MARTIN: <i>I agree, Jefferson.</i>

561
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,764
Something's coming.

562
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,290
Release the President.

563
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,927
We knew you would come.

564
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,451
Did you guys hear that?

565
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,768
'Cause I heard it in my head.

566
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,169
Yeah, we heard it.

567
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,605
Well, if nobody else is freaked out by it,

568
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,125
far be it for me to panic.

569
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:08,564
You don't need to harm him
to get whatever it is you want from us.

570
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,406
Release him,
and nothing will happen to you.

571
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,120
He is not who we want.

572
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,641
It's a trap!

573
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,326
Supergirl, do something.

574
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,764
I didn't think about it, Oliver.

575
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,126
I didn't think about the future.

576
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:44,961
I was so focused on the past
that I didn't think about it until now.

577
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,005
I changed so much.

578
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,964
What is this?

579
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,529
This is an article from the future.

580
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,131
It's a story about me vanishing.

581
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,128
Used to be written by Iris West-Allen,

582
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,527
but now, I don't know,

583
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:05,968
something's changed with Iris.
Something's changed with our future.

584
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,366
- God, what did I do?
- Barry,

585
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,170
this is a weird-looking newspaper article.

586
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,890
It doesn't mean anything.

587
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:16,482
You need to stop
beating yourself up over this.

588
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:19,160
I'm sorry, but how can you say that?
I'm responsible for all of this.

589
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,328
Well, maybe, maybe not.

590
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,724
Barry, you made a choice.

591
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,729
You wanted to see
your parents alive again.

592
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,480
Do you honestly know anyone,
that if they were in your shoes,

593
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,330
wouldn't do the exact same thing?

594
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,488
I would do the exact same thing.

595
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,051
Barry, after the <i>Gambit</i> went down,

596
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,766
it was me, my father
and a crew member on a life raft,

597
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,729
lost at sea.

598
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,044
Enough food and water
for one person, maybe.

599
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,528
My father took a gun,
shot the crew member,

600
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,087
told me to survive,
and then turned the gun on himself.

601
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,840
He shot himself in the head,
he sacrificed himself

602
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,565
<i>so that I could live.</i>

603
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,410
<i>Nothing I could do, no choice.</i>

604
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,722
Slade Wilson drove a sword

605
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,406
right through my mother's heart
in front of my sister,

606
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,731
and I was there.
I was helpless on the ground,

607
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,723
I was powerless to stop it.

608
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,962
<i>No choice. Do you not think</i>

609
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,568
that I wouldn't give anything to go back
and to make things different?

610
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,450
You never told me that.

611
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,571
Barry, the world isn't different
because you changed the timeline.

612
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,246
<i>Change happens,</i>

613
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,646
tragedy happens.

614
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:21,771
People make choices,
and those choices affect everyone else.

615
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,969
You're not a God, Barry.

616
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,771
CISCO: <i>Hey, guys, wherever you are
right now, we need you.</i>

617
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,651
Oh, things just got so much worse.

618
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,085
Guys.

619
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,761
Can we talk about this?

620
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,441
Guess not.

621
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:03,408
- What's wrong with them?
- I don't know. We need to find out.

622
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,369
Okay.

623
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,325
You really did it this time.

624
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,284
- Seriously?
- Yeah, seriously.

625
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,811
- What's that?
- That would be heat vision. Okay.

626
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,645
What is going on?

627
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,451
Barry and Oliver stayed behind while
everyone went to go save the President,

628
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,160
but now everyone's crazy and
going all <i>Kill Bill</i> on the both of them.

629
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,362
The Dominators have them
under some sort of mind control.

630
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,971
They can't hold them off forever.

631
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,969
- I gotta get out there.
- The hell you do.

632
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,161
They can't beat them by themselves,

633
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,885
especially not
with Supergirl against them.

634
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,051
Wally?

635
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,051
Kid Flash.

636
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,010
Wally, talk to me.

637
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,406
Hey, come on.

638
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,202
Guys, Wally's hurt bad but he's alive.

639
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,721
Get an ETA on overriding the mind control?

640
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,007
- Bingo!
- Yahtzee!

641
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,611
You go first, you go first,
it's your office.

642
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,365
There's a weird signal
coming from the salt mines.

643
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,891
For the record,
that is what I was gonna say.

644
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,161
Well, can you jam it?

645
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,249
Um, no.

646
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,881
- How many of those you have left?
- Probably not enough.

647
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,130
Okay, this hallway leads
to a bunker under the building,

648
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,408
- just hold them off as long as you can.
- Where're you going?

649
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,401
If they can't shut it down, maybe she can.

650
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,761
Okay.

651
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,607
Hey, Supergirl,

652
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,964
let's finally see who's faster.

653
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,527
Too slow.

654
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,328
- What is he doing?
- He's making her angry.

655
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,964
But he knows Supergirl is invincible.

656
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,009
I think maybe that's the point.

657
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,445
Barry?

658
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,360
Guys,

659
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,206
they're back.

660
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,726
What happened?

661
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:40,123
You didn't kill me,
so my day is looking up.

662
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,641
I'm so sorry, I...

663
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,928
You're not the first superhero
to be mind-controlled.

664
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:58,567
Okay, I know what you're gonna say,
but I had to do something.

665
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,401
- I'm...
- I'm glad you're okay.

666
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,609
- Don't ever do that again.
- Ah!

667
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,086
Sorry, not sorry.

668
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,162
Come on, let's get you checked out.

669
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,161
And then we can talk about
how dumb that was.

670
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,685
Okay.

671
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,681
H.R.: <i>Okay.</i>

672
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,091
"Okay," what?

673
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:25,251
They don't see your potential, I do.

674
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,241
One of my many gifts.

675
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,321
You wanna train?

676
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,206
I'll train you.

677
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,840
So what's it like,
being all mind-controlled and stuff?

678
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,805
I didn't realize
he had a mind to be controlled.

679
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,770
RAY: <i>Barry, about before,</i>

680
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,805
message or no message,

681
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,442
- we're with you.
- Thank you.

682
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,327
- So where's Supergirl?
- Scanning the city to make sure

683
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,727
there aren't any more of the orbs
that whammied all of you.

684
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,803
Okay. So now what?

685
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,647
We call Lyla, tell her these Dominators
aren't here peacefully.

686
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,641
Sara!

687
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,810
Everybody inside, go!
