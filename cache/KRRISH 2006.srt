1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,600
What a mess!

2
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,200
Krishna... Krishna... Krishna...

3
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,100
What am I going to do with this boy?

4
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:38,600
Krishna...

5
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,100
Yes, grandma?

6
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,200
Whose sketch book is this?

7
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,900
Mine, grandma.

8
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,200
And who made these sketches?

9
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,000
Grandma, why do grown ups sometimes
ask childish questions?

10
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,100
If it's my sketch book, obviously,
I've made the sketches.

11
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:58,500
Grown ups talk like children when
children act like grown ups.

12
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:02,800
Tell me something, how did you make
such beautiful sketches?

13
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,800
With this.

14
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,500
Like I've made your
sketch right now. See?

15
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,800
Wow!

16
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,300
Let me see!

17
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,500
Rohit loved drawing too.

18
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,400
Papa made sketches too?

19
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,500
Yes.

20
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,500
When Rohit was your age and
he used to get tired studying

21
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,900
he used to sketch.

22
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,500
I want to be like my Papa too.

23
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,500
You are like your Papa!

24
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,800
Mrs. Mehra, I've called you here
to tell you that...

25
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,500
we want to take Krishna's I.Q. test.

26
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,800
I.Q. test?

27
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,700
But why, Father?

28
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,900
Krishna's absolutely normal.

29
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,100
No, Mrs. Mehra.

30
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,400
He's not normal.

31
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,500
What are you saying, Father?

32
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,400
Are you telling me...

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,500
that Krishna is the same as
Rohit was in his childhood?

34
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,300
No, Father.

35
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,600
Krishna's a very bright child.

36
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:10,600
He scores very good marks, he
always gets A-plus grades.

37
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,200
He even does his homework
without any help.

38
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,000
And that of other children too.

39
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,500
What?

40
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,900
This is the notebook of
a Class 3 student.

41
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,800
This is...

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,500
...Krishna's handwriting.

43
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,500
Yes, Krishna has done this
child's math homework.

44
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,800
But how's that possible, Father?
Krishna's still in Class 1.

45
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,500
That's exactly why we wish to
take Krishna's I.Q. test...

46
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:52,100
so that we can ascertain just how bright,
sharp and ahead he is...

47
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,200
of other children his age

48
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,300
Krishna, how do you define amount?

49
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,800
Principle plus interest is equal to amount, sir

50
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,800
After what age does the brain
of a person stop growing?

51
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,800
After the age of 15, Father.

52
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,100
What happened, Mrs. Mehra?

53
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,400
The I.Q. test was going so well, Krishna
was answering all questions right...

54
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,100
That's exactly why I brought him away.

55
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,400
But why?

56
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,900
You ought to be proud that
your grandson is so brilliant.

57
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,000
He's a genius, a miracle child.

58
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,300
Earlier it was a hunch
but now I'm sure.

59
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,800
The powers that Jadoo
had bestowed on Rohit...

60
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:04,300
...have been inherited by Krishna.

61
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,700
You will see, Mrs. Mehra.
Like his father...

62
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,200
...Krishna will also achieve
great success.

63
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,400
His name will appear in
the Guinness Book...

64
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,600
...and the whole world will
speak highly of him.

65
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,500
That's exactly what I don't want, Father.

66
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,500
What did Rohit gain, after all?

67
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,900
They gave him medals, applauded him...

68
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,900
but everybody only used him...

69
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,700
...took advantage of him, Father.

70
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,700
And then...

71
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:48,900
...I lost my son and my daughter-in-law.

72
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,600
I don't want to lose Krishna now.

73
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,400
I don't want to lose him.

74
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,600
I can understand your concern and fears.

75
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,500
But destiny cannot be changed.

76
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,700
And talent is a gift which cannot be hidden.

77
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,700
I will hide it.

78
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,900
I'll take Krishna far away...

79
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,800
...very far.

80
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:13,400
Krishna... Krishna...

81
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,400
Coming, Grandma!

82
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,900
Toofan, let's see who gets home first.

83
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,600
Hey... what did you see?

84
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:21,800
As usual, I've seen nothing and
I won't say a word to anyone.

85
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,800
But as usual, I'll take
something from you.

86
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:26,900
Take this!

87
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,800
I hide all your secrets and you
always give me jaggery?

88
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,200
It won't work today.

89
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,400
Ok, ok, come home...
I'll give you Bournvita.

90
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,400
Bournvita?

91
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,400
Yes. Don't you want to be like me?

92
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,500
Yes!

93
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,200
So go, wear something below and come.

94
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,300
Krishna...

95
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,400
You've come?

96
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,000
Grandma, how do you know I've come?

97
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,500
I make no sound at all!

98
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,900
I can hear your heartbeats.

99
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,500
But how, Grandma?

100
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,400
Your eyes say that you've been
up to mischief again.

101
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,800
Mischief? Not at all, Grandma!

102
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,800
No mischief? Then why're you hiding
your face like a thief?

103
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,000
Not hiding, just washing my face, Grandma

104
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,400
Ok ok... lay the breakfast.

105
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,400
I've come!

106
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,200
What happened?

107
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,800
Chintu dropped a glass, Grandma...

108
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,600
Me?

109
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,800
Chintu! Up to mischief again?

110
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,000
Tell her the truth, Krishna, else I shall.

111
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,400
Sure, go ahead

112
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,900
I'll tell her since you've asked me to

113
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,700
Grandma, Krishna was running faster
than Toofan today

114
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,400
What? Faster than Toofan?

115
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,600
So? What's the big deal?

116
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,800
And how about that?

117
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:29,500
What?

118
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,600
You climbed the mountain faster
than the monkeys...

119
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,000
Grandma, you know that tall
mountain by the temple?

120
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,200
Krishna jumped from it
into the river.

121
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,900
I thought it was all over.
But he came back!

122
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,100
Krishna, why do you do such things?

123
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,900
I've forbidden you time and again!
Why do you still do such things?

124
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,600
What do I do Grandma?
You tell me!

125
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,600
How do I rid myself of loneliness?

126
00:12:58,900 --> 00:12:59,900
Who do I make friends with?

127
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,400
Boys my age have gone away to the city,
to either study or earn a living

128
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,600
And those that are here don't
want be friends with me

129
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:11,000
They say... I'm not like them

130
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,300
So I've made friends with
animals and birds

131
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,100
Keep myself busy with nature.

132
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,300
But even out here in the open,
I sometimes feel stifled

133
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:33,500
I feel like running far away
from here.

134
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,800
Will you leave me and go away?

135
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,100
It's because of you that I don't go!
Else, I'd have left long ago

136
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,700
Krishna has grown up, Rohit

137
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:09,200
I'm not sure how long I will be
able to hide him

138
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,700
Where is Sonia Mehra and her
grandson Krishna, Father?

139
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:19,900
It's the third time in so many years
that I've come to ask you

140
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,300
And my answer is still the same.

141
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:27,500
I have no idea where Mrs. Mehra is.
I really don't know!

142
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,300
Why do you keep coming to me again
and again and waste my time?

143
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,300
Because you are the last link to
Rohit Mehra's family...

144
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:39,300
and you're the last person Sonia Mehra
met before she went missing

145
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,100
You know where they are,
but you're lying.

146
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,200
What?

147
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,300
You are lying, Father.

148
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:53,500
When I asked you whether Krishna possessed
the powers Rohit had...

149
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,900
you said he didn't.

150
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:00,200
But I was told... that the son was
better than his father

151
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:05,200
That he possesses all of Rohit's powers.
So tell me, Father...

152
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,900
I'll pay any price you ask

153
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,800
How dare you! Mr. Sinha,
this is a school!

154
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,100
We don't indulge
in business here!

155
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,500
Please leave now!

156
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:21,300
You're making a mistake, Father.
A big mistake.

157
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,600
Krishna! Look!

158
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,700
What a huge kite!

159
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,800
But where's the string?

160
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,700
Must've snapped. Let's get it!

161
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,200
Don't scream! You needn't be afraid

162
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:50,300
Close your eyes and hold on to me tightly

163
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,700
Stop screaming!

164
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,900
Else, I'll drop you.

165
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,300
Close your eyes

166
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,800
Close your eyes, not widen them.

167
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,600
Close them!

168
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,300
Close!

169
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,100
The glider came this way!

170
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,200
There it is!

171
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,800
Where?

172
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,700
Up there!

173
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,900
Oh my God! Where's Priya?

174
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,000
There!

175
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,100
She's breathing. She must've passed out

176
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,500
Let's take her back to the camp

177
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,600
The glider was at such a height,
Priya Ma'am was down here...

178
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,800
...and she's still breathing?
Just imagine!

179
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,900
Just imagine.

180
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,000
Imagine!

181
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,000
Where am I?

182
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,000
You're alive and you're with us

183
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,900
Thank God you're alive.

184
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,700
Not God, it's that boy
we ought to thank

185
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,900
That boy? Which boy?

186
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,600
The one who saved my life

187
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,500
A boy saved you?

188
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,700
But there was no one there

189
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:14,600
No sir! He must've been there!
We fell from the tree together.

190
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:19,000
Together? But you went
in the glider alone.

191
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,900
How did he come on
the tree to rescue you?

192
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,800
Did he fall from the skies?

193
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,600
Yes sir. That's where he came from!

194
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,600
Priya, trust me, you were all alone. Right?

195
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,200
Ghost!

196
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,000
What happened?

197
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,900
G-H-O-S-T!

198
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,900
Komal sir, ghost!

199
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,500
Ghost?

200
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,500
What are you blabbering, Bahadur?

201
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:58,300
No blabber, sir. It's a chant.
To drive the ghost away.

202
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,500
What rubbish, Bahadur?
Ghost in broad daylight?

203
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:07,000
This is a jungle, sir! Night
and day are all the same here

204
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,000
Priya Ma'am, was he tall?

205
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,200
Yes

206
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,200
Well built?

207
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,400
Yes!

208
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,600
Fair-skinned?

209
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,400
Yes!

210
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,400
Kalicharan!

211
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,400
Kalicharan?

212
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,400
Kalicharan?

213
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,300
Yes, sir! Kalicharan's ghost!

214
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:26,000
Been wandering in the mountains
for ages... upside down on trees

215
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,400
Just imagine!

216
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,400
What nonsense!

217
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,100
A ghost in our times?
I don't believe all this.

218
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,700
I also don't believe all this!

219
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,600
What happened?

220
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:37,800
What happened?

221
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,300
Relax...

222
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,200
Sir, it's either a sprain or a fracture

223
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,600
Oh no!

224
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,800
We're here on a 10-day
adventure camp...

225
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,500
...and you've already broken your foot!

226
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:56,400
Honey, take her into the tent
and give her first-aid

227
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:57,400
Careful...

228
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:07,200
Bahadur, go to your phone booth
and call for a car

229
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,100
We need to send Priya to
the city for treatment

230
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,200
I'll go at night, sir.
I feel scared by day.

231
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,200
What?

232
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,100
Yes! Kalicharan's ghost.

233
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,500
Scares people by day
and sleeps at night.

234
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,600
Just imagine!

235
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,200
Easy, easy

236
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,400
Just relax. I'll organize a painkiller

237
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,900
C'mon guys. Let's go

238
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,600
You're always screaming!
Doesn't your throat hurt?

239
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,300
Your eyes are widening again!

240
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,400
You must never get scared...

241
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,800
What happened, Priya?
Why were you screaming?

242
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,400
Honey, he was here! In this room!
He was here, Honey!

243
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,800
Who? Who was here?

244
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,200
The boy who saved me
on the tree...

245
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,000
the one I told you about, sir...

246
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,800
God! What's happened to this girl?

247
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:19,400
Priya, it's just 2 seconds since I left...

248
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,900
Are you saying that someone came
and even went away in the meantime?

249
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,300
You must've dozed off and
probably had a dream.

250
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,800
I didn't dream! Why doesn't
someone believe me?

251
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,700
The moment I closed my eyes,
he entered the tent...

252
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,600
he twisted my ankle and the pain...

253
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,700
Hey! The pain in my ankle is gone! See!

254
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,400
The pain has disappeared!

255
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,800
Oh my God sir! My foot is all right!

256
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,800
Look at this... I can jump!

257
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,400
My foot has become all right

258
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,400
Either this girl has really gone mad,
or she's conning us!

259
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:00,500
No, sir! I'm not conning you! See...
I can jump! Believe me!

260
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:04,600
I believe you! Kalicharan has
cured your foot

261
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,600
Just imagine!

262
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,600
Kalicharan? So this ghost
is also a doctor?

263
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,800
Not is, was!

264
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,100
Kalicharan's father, Lalcharan.
Doctor Lalcharan.

265
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,600
There's no Kalicharan, there's
no Lalcharan... it's a pack of lies!

266
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,400
It's some stupid local boy
playing a prank on me

267
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,400
I'm going to find him today,
bring him before everybody...

268
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,700
and prove to them that he's
just another boy!

269
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:27,500
Are you looking for someone?

270
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,600
What?

271
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,300
You! I'm looking for you!

272
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,500
Where do you keep disappearing?

273
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,300
Why don't you appear before others
as you appear before me?

274
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,700
And that stupid Bahadur keeps telling
them that you're a ghost!

275
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:45,400
You... you're not Kalicharan, are you?

276
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,100
You're human, aren't you?

277
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:52,900
Why are you kids giggling?

278
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,500
Who are you talking to, aunty?

279
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:59,700
Aunty? Firstly you call me aunty and
then you ask who I am speaking to?

280
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,300
I'm talking to this boy!

281
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:02,800
Which Boy?

282
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,800
Can't you see this boy here?

283
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,100
That's a lamppost there, not a Boy,

284
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,200
That's a boy

285
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:13,800
Lamppost

286
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,500
Boy!

287
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,100
Lamppost!

288
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,100
Shut up!

289
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,500
One moment. Please Listen...

290
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,800
What do you see there?
A boy? Or a lamppost?

291
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,800
Well... there's neither a boy
there nor a lamppost.

292
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,900
Look carefully...

293
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,700
What happened?

294
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,700
I'm feeling giddy.

295
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,100
You seem unwell

296
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:50,500
My house is nearby...
come rest there for a while

297
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,100
I'll get you a glass of water

298
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:52,700
Okay!

299
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,100
Why's his picture garlanded?

300
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:10,600
My son. He died 20 years ago

301
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,400
But how's that possible?
Moments ago, I...

302
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:42,000
It's a tragic tale that took place
20 years ago

303
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,300
Champa and Kalicharan

304
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,600
Kalicharan and Champa.
Madly in love with each other

305
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,100
They were like one soul two bodies.

306
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,600
And then one day...

307
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,000
What happened?

308
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,200
Kalicharan was putting some flowers
in Champa's hair...

309
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,200
Lalcharan happened to see them.

310
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,300
He went red with rage!

311
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:13,300
And one day, he deceived Champa into
drinking poison, in the name of medicine

312
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:19,000
And poor Champa! She screamed,
"Kali, Kali..."

313
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,200
...and died. Just imagine!

314
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:28,600
Kalicharan just could not bear
the pain of Champa's death

315
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,300
Over there! Look at that peak!

316
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:39,700
From that very peak, Kalicharan
screamed, "Champa, Champa..."

317
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:43,400
...and jumped to his death!

318
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:50,400
Ever since, Kalicharan's spirit has
been looking for his Champa!

319
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:54,100
Why're you pointing towards me?

320
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,600
Because you are his Champa

321
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,000
Me? Champa!

322
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,100
I mean, you look like Champa

323
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,900
I'm feeling terribly scared. We can't
stay here anymore, please

324
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,400
Nobody goes anywhere!

325
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:13,300
This silly Bahadur talks a lot of nonsense...

326
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,000
...and you start imagining?

327
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:20,600
Bahadur, you're not telling these kids
anymore stories. Understand?

328
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,600
And now get ready. We're going
mountain-climbing

329
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,800
You will use ascenders to climb...

330
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,700
...descenders to come down.

331
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,000
And you will come rappelling, down.

332
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,400
'right sir. ok sir'

333
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,600
Ghost!

334
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,500
Priya!

335
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:21,800
What... what on earth is that?

336
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,100
Kalicharan!

337
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Just imagine

338
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,300
Can't imagine

339
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,200
Temperature. 104 degrees

340
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,400
We had told you sir.

341
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
But you didn't listen.

342
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,800
Sorry, sorry

343
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,300
We're not staying here any more

344
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,600
Bahadur, leave immediately.

345
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:53,100
And arrange for
our transportation. Go!

346
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,500
You've snatched my bread and butter.

347
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,900
I'm broke even before I could
make some money.

348
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,100
Just imagine!

349
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:05,100
Why did you climb the mountain
like that, in front of them?

350
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,700
What could I do? She screamed
so loudly...

351
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,700
...that I got scared

352
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:17,900
And now they are so scared,
that they're all going back.

353
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:22,100
Now keep searching for your
Champa all your life!

354
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,900
What do we do, Bahadur?

355
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,900
How do I know? I did as you said

356
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,600
You think of a way now

357
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,800
Idea!

358
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,400
What?

359
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,400
Champa-ji...

360
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,000
My name is Priya.

361
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:44,900
In this lifetime

362
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:49,200
In your earlier six births you were
Kalicharan's Champa

363
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,800
This is your 7th birth.

364
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,500
If you leave without meeting him,
he'll be very angry...

365
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,700
And he'll follow you
wherever you go

366
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,000
Just imagine!

367
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:03,300
How will he follow her?
We're going back to Singapore

368
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:07,800
He can reach Singapore too!
He doesn't need air tickets

369
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,600
Bahadur, she's not meeting any ghost!
What if something happens to her?

370
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:16,700
This ghost is a gentleman, ma'am.
He hasn't harmed a soul

371
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,500
Am I right?

372
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,100
Yes

373
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:22,000
I leave the rest to you

374
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:24,900
Wait Bahadur!

375
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:28,700
Honey...

376
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:29,700
Yes?

377
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,100
I think he's right

378
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,000
You're going to meet him?

379
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:37,500
Yes. Only then will he find peace

380
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,800
And you better not stop her

381
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:44,700
if Kalicharan gets to know...
just imagine!

382
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,700
No! I wasn't stopping her!

383
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,900
I was only advising you, right?

384
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:55,000
Listen, you must meet the ghost.
He's such a gentleman!

385
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,600
I'm off to sleep.
Bye, good night!

386
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:07,100
Champa... Champa...

387
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:37,500
Hello! Kalicharan ji...

388
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,100
Here I am...

389
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,200
...to help you get peace

390
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,700
Please... could you appear
before me?

391
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,400
"I feel scared"

392
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,500
Do ghosts also feel
scared nowadays?

393
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:02,600
"I'm not a ghost"

394
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,700
You aren't a ghost?

395
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,900
Oh yes, I get it...

396
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:13,100
it offends you when someone calls
you a ghost, isn't it?

397
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:18,500
And you're right! You've ended
your life for love

398
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:23,100
And those who end their lives
for love aren't ghosts...

399
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,200
They are... they are...

400
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,200
They're lovers! You're
a lover, aren't you?

401
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:31,900
I'm Krishna

402
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,500
Look... stay right there!

403
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,500
Don't come closer, okay?

404
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,300
You sent for me
and here I am.

405
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,600
You'll get peace now

406
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,000
May I go now?

407
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,900
All I want is friendship

408
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,000
Friendship?

409
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:04,100
Hey... don't be afraid.
I'm as human as you are

410
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,300
Touch me if you can't
believe that.

411
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:08,900
Touch you?

412
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,000
I'm sorry

413
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,800
See? The color of my blood
is red, too.

414
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,700
Are you convinced now
that I'm not a ghost?

415
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:25,400
If you're not a ghost then
that picture?

416
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:30,500
That's my father's photograph.
He's no more

417
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,100
I look exactly like him.

418
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:33,700
I see

419
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:39,100
But the other day, how did you suddenly
get on that tree to save my life?

420
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:43,000
And yesterday! How did you climb
that mountain so fast?

421
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:47,000
Maybe because I've got used to it

422
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:53,300
Right from my childhood, I've grown up
playing among the trees and mountains...

423
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,800
...with the birds and the animals.
I spend most of my time here

424
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,100
I guess that's why they're my friends

425
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,600
Would you like to
meet my friends?

426
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,200
Wow! I still can't believe it!

427
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:27,300
I won't let you poke that pin again!
It hurts because I'm not Kalicharan.

428
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:36,400
See? He's not Kalicharan!
I've always been saying that!

429
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,300
That's what you're still saying.

430
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,400
I'm Right!

431
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:50,800
Kalicharan! You're so cute!

432
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:55,700
Krishna, you really got us scared.
But that was a nice prank.

433
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:59,900
Boys and girls,
camping continues!

434
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,800
Krishna, you also join the group!

435
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,100
Just imagine!

436
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,600
C'mon! C'mon!

437
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,000
Come

438
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,900
From where are you getting a flower of
a new color every time, Krishna?

439
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,200
From the rainbow.

440
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,800
The rainbow?

441
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,000
Yes

442
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,300
Look

443
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,600
Wow Krishna! It's such
a beautiful sight

444
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:48,000
Had I not come here, I'd really
have regretted it

445
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,600
So would I

446
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,200
I've never seen such a lovely place.

447
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:04,800
It's so beautiful. So pure,
so serene, so quiet

448
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,400
You should see this place in autumn.

449
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,800
It's a riot of colors

450
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:14,400
When the sunrays touch the
fallen leaves, everything turns to gold

451
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
It's so beautiful

452
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,600
Makes you realize what
a great artist God really is

453
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,600
Krishna, you speak English?

454
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,600
And with such fluency?

455
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:31,700
Grandma taught me. She's my
school, my college and my university

456
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:36,000
But you need talent to
learn anything, Krishna

457
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,800
And you possess amazing talent.

458
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,200
You're amazing!

459
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:43,400
You shouldn't be wasting your
talent in this remote village

460
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,300
You ought to get out of here.

461
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,200
People in the world out there...

462
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,900
...not just need talented people
like you, they appreciate them too

463
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,400
But my grandma is my world

464
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,200
I will never leave her.

465
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,800
You love your grandma
very much?

466
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,000
More than very much

467
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,500
Krishna, I want to meet
your grandma

468
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:01,800
"Look, even the breeze..."

469
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,600
"even the breeze now rises
in a wave..."

470
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,100
"having touched you..."

471
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:13,000
"secretly, quietly"

472
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:27,500
"There's a joy..."

473
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:32,800
"there's a joy that
now sings..."

474
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,200
"having met you..."

475
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,500
"secretly, quietly"

476
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:12,900
"It just doesn't seem as if you have
come from somewhere far"

477
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:18,100
"For yours has been the face
I have dreamt of"

478
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:28,000
"Your path is the one
I'd like to follow."

479
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:32,900
"It's the first ever journey
that’s been so enjoyable"

480
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:38,100
"Changing colors and smiling..."

481
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:40,300
"are the desires of my heart..."

482
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:43,700
"secretly, quietly"

483
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:23,000
"There are moments in life that get
etched in memory"

484
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:28,100
"And there are those wonderful people
who never leave your heart"

485
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:37,900
"Everybody understands the
language of the heart"

486
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:43,200
"it connects even with strangers,"

487
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:55,700
"Dusk seems to be saying
something to you and me..."

488
00:43:55,900 --> 00:44:00,100
"secretly, quietly"

489
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:37,600
Grandma... this is Priya.

490
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,500
Hello, Grandma

491
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:40,900
We've met before.

492
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:43,300
I remember. Tell me something...

493
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:46,200
Why did you go away, the other day?

494
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,300
I fled, grandma! Out of fright

495
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:51,500
Krishna was playing a ghost
to scare us

496
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:52,700
Ghost?

497
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:02,400
And that well-built Komal Sir
was trembling in his boots!

498
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:05,300
He was down with 104 degrees fever!

499
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:07,000
What? 104 degrees?

500
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:08,800
Is that true, Krishna?

501
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:11,900
You shouldn't play such pranks
on anyone, my son

502
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:13,600
Why scare someone so much?

503
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:17,400
Did you apologize?

504
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,800
Yes, Grandma. To everybody

505
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:32,400
Priya... tell me something about yourself

506
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,700
I live in Singapore with my Mother.

507
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:38,100
My father is no more

508
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:40,800
I'm here in India on a vacation
with my friend...

509
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,500
Her family lives in Chandigarh

510
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:43,600
I see

511
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:46,000
I'll go and wash my hands

512
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:19,500
Priya, for how many more days
are you here?

513
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:22,100
Days? we're leaving today.

514
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:23,500
In fact, right now

515
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:26,200
Oh my God! I must leave now.

516
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,100
Everyone must be waiting for me.

517
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:30,700
Here's my phone number.

518
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:32,800
Whenever you come here again...

519
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,300
...please give me the opportunity
to serve you again

520
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:37,100
Where's Priya?

521
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:38,100
There she is!

522
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:39,500
Hurry, we've got to leave.

523
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:41,000
C'mon, everybody! Get in!

524
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:43,100
Nice meeting you.

525
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:45,800
we really enjoyed your
company, Krishna.

526
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,200
We'd love to come back.

527
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:48,900
It was great fun, Krishna.

528
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:54,900
Thanks, Krishna!

529
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:57,300
I had a wonderful time with you.

530
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:01,000
I didn't even realize how ten days
have passed by

531
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:02,300
Really!

532
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,600
I'm going to miss this place...

533
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,300
And you, too.

534
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:10,500
Look after yourself, Kalicharan.

535
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:13,500
I have to go now.

536
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:16,700
May I?

537
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:21,200
May I go?

538
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:28,100
Krishna, how will she go,
if you don't leave her hand?

539
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:33,600
Bye, Krishna

540
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:35,500
Bye

541
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:56,400
Priya... See!

542
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:32,000
Looks like you're no longer Priya.
You've become Radha.

543
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,400
Krishna's Radha.

544
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:37,000
What?

545
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:42,200
I seriously think Krishna has
fallen in love with you.

546
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:49,900
I hope not...

547
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:21,200
Honey, pray that the boss' mood is ok,
we're five days late.

548
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,300
Hi! Honey. Hi! Priya

549
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,000
We are saying hi to them,

550
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,600
Why're they waving five fingers at us?

551
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,300
Stupid! The five fingers
stand for five days.

552
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,400
Oh my God! You mean boss too...

553
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,900
You took a leave of 15 days...

554
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,800
...and have come after 20!

555
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:52,200
So you girls are now fired!

556
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:56,800
Why just India?
Go on a world tour! Go!

557
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:01,200
Stop, Priya.

558
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:05,400
Sorry boss, but you can't insult us.

559
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:07,200
Yeah?

560
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:08,300
Yeah!

561
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:13,700
Boss, you can't question
our integrity.

562
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:15,700
Agreed we were on a leave
of 15 days

563
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:19,800
But on the 16th day we got to work

564
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,700
What amazing work have you done?

565
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:25,700
We have found an Indian superboy.

566
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:27,400
Honey! What are you saying?

567
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,100
Let me speak, please.

568
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:34,700
Boss, this boy scales high mountains
as if they were mere steps for him!

569
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,600
He runs faster than a horse!

570
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:37,800
And guess what?

571
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,400
He puts his hand in the river
and pulls out fish!

572
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:48,400
Just think of it, if a boy as talented
as him were to come here...

573
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:52,900
...your rating's are going to soar!
Just imagine!

574
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:59,300
I hope you're not trying to make
a fool out of me?

575
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,200
No way, boss!
You will believe it too...

576
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,700
...when you see him doing all those
incredible things here!

577
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:12,600
See him here! How? How's he going
to come here?

578
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:16,400
I tried to stop you, but you just
wouldn't listen!

579
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:22,200
Please, Priya! There was no other way
of saving our job.

580
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,700
Besides, what's wrong if Krishna
comes here?

581
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:27,600
There you go again!

582
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:29,500
Relax! Sit down

583
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:34,000
If Krishna's talents are
showcased on our channel...

584
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:37,300
...he'd be the one who'd gain.
Name, fame, money...

585
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:40,900
He'll have everything!
He'll be a big man!

586
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:42,200
Just think!

587
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,800
I know you're right, Honey...

588
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,700
...but Krishna will never leave
his grandma and come.

589
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,500
She is his world.

590
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:57,200
But now you are a part
of his world too.

591
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:03,600
I know. Now do as I say.

592
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:06,100
Call for Krishna!

593
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:08,900
Phone...

594
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:11,400
Phone...

595
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,600
Krishna, phone

596
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:19,000
He's coming!

597
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:20,400
Who's coming?

598
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:24,800
A boy? Is he an Indian?
Does he live here in Singapore?

599
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:27,000
Have you finally chosen
someone, Priya?

600
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,700
There you go again, Mom!
I haven't chosen anyone

601
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:31,000
So choose one!

602
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:31,800
I will...

603
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
...please leave now,
we got to save our jobs.

604
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:35,000
And when will you settle down?

605
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:35,800
Tomorrow

606
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,300
Call from Priya!

607
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:38,700
Priya?

608
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:40,500
Hello, Krishna...

609
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:41,300
Priya...

610
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:43,700
How are you?

611
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:47,100
I'm fine, but I don't like anything

612
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:49,100
Me too

613
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,100
I can't sleep

614
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:54,100
Me too

615
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:57,300
I want to meet you

616
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:00,100
Me too

617
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,800
He's not saying anything more than
"Me too", so what do I do?

618
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
You continue reading,
read from here!

619
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,600
Priya, why are you quiet?

620
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:12,700
Krishna, can't you come here
and meet my mother?

621
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:13,900
Your mother?

622
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:17,000
Yes, if you don't meet my mother...

623
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,800
...she'll get me married to
someone else.

624
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:21,900
Someone else?

625
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:24,500
No, I won't let that happen!

626
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:27,000
I'm coming there, Priya!

627
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:32,700
But... how will I get there?

628
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,600
Yes... how will you get here?

629
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:40,100
Hello, Krishna! Don't worry.
Just give the phone to Bahadur?

630
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:59,700
Krishna! Aircraft! Singapore!
Priya Ma'am!

631
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:01,700
How? When?

632
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:08,200
Just imagine!

633
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:31,800
"Come, let me tell you
a love story"

634
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:37,800
"There was a boy and
there was a girl..."

635
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:04,700
"She smiled"

636
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:07,800
"He smiled"

637
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:13,900
"Little did they know what
was happening"

638
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:05,300
"What they couldn't say till then,
they started saying..."

639
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:12,100
"what they couldn't hear till then
they started hearing"

640
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:44,100
"It brings a smile to my face to
see us falling in love..."

641
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:49,000
"We're lost in love"

642
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,000
"The world didn't matter to them
anymore"

643
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:01,800
"There was a boy
and there was a girl..."

644
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:08,700
"she smiled, he smiled..."

645
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:14,900
"little did they know what
was happening"

646
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:19,300
"Come, let me tell you a love story"

647
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:25,600
"There was a boy and there was a girl..."

648
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:43,100
"There was no yearning,
there was no aching..."

649
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:49,700
"they came together...
their hearts skipped a beat"

650
00:57:54,900 --> 00:58:00,400
"There was no yearning,
there was no aching..."

651
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:07,200
"they came together... their hearts
skipped a beat"

652
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:14,900
"What was destined happened..."

653
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:22,700
"They got lost in love"

654
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:27,200
"They got lost in love"

655
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:34,000
"Oh, how one heart ruled the other!"

656
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:40,300
"There was a boy and there was a girl..."

657
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:49,100
Grandma!

658
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:50,400
I am here

659
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:52,000
Grandma!

660
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:55,200
Grandma!

661
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:56,100
Put me down

662
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:00,200
What's the matter, Krishna?

663
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,200
You look very happy today.

664
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:04,900
Grandma, I got a call from Priya!

665
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:07,200
You told me that she'd forget me?

666
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:10,200
But it's not true, Grandma!
She misses me every moment.

667
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:13,400
She's always thinking of me!
And she keeps seeing me everywhere!

668
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:18,700
And I never told you...

669
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:22,800
...I've been in a similar state.

670
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:27,200
Ever since Priya has left,
I never liked anything.

671
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,400
But today with her call,
I feel better.

672
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:35,500
Grandma, Priya has called me
to Singapore

673
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:37,100
She wants me to meet her mother.

674
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:38,200
Her mother?

675
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:39,000
Yes

676
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,000
If I don't go and ask for her hand...

677
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,800
...her mother's going to get her
married to someone else

678
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:46,200
I said I wouldn't let that happen,
I'm coming.

679
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,800
I did the right thing, didn't I Grandma?
May I go, Grandma?

680
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:59,300
It's only a matter of a few days, grandma

681
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:02,700
I'll ask for Priya's hand in marriage
and bring her back with me

682
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:06,100
May I go, Grandma?

683
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:12,200
You're not answering, Grandma

684
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:17,200
When you've already decided to go...

685
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:20,500
...why ask me?

686
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:24,100
Go on. Go.

687
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,200
You aren't happy, Grandma?

688
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:29,700
Don't you like Priya?

689
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:32,600
I like Priya...

690
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:36,300
...but I don't like the idea
of you going so far.

691
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,700
If Priya really loves you...

692
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:43,200
...she can also come here
with her mother

693
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:45,800
But you're not going there!

694
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,200
Why not?

695
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:52,400
I said you're not going,
it means you're not going

696
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:55,000
That's it!

697
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:58,000
But why can't I go?
What's going to happen?

698
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:00,000
I've been hearing this since I was a child!

699
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:02,700
Don't go here, don't go there,
don't do this, don't do that...

700
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:04,300
...don't go to the city with your friends!

701
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:07,500
Forget the city, you don't even
allow me to go beyond the river...

702
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:08,400
Why?

703
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:16,500
Now you've become so big that
I have to give explanations to you?

704
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:22,700
You'll have to tell today, Grandma!

705
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:25,000
Why do you keep stopping me?

706
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:26,600
Why can't I go anywhere?

707
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:32,000
Because I don't want to lose you

708
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,200
So what do you want then?

709
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:37,800
Cut me off from the world and
keep looking at your face forever?

710
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:40,100
Bang my head on trees
and mountains all my life?

711
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:42,500
You want me to be alone all my life?
Is that what you want?

712
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:53,100
But I can't do I that, Grandma!
I have my own life too...

713
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:56,600
...my own dreams. I too want to
achieve something!

714
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:58,200
I want an identity for myself!

715
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:06,200
You don't want to lose me,
even if I have to lose Priya

716
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:09,400
You can't see me happy

717
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:15,200
I have always obeyed you.
And you can't agree to my one request?

718
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:18,700
Today I realize, how selfish you are!

719
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:23,000
You only think of yourself!
Only yourself!

720
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,900
You don't care for me!

721
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:30,000
Had my parents been alive,
they'd have understood my feelings!

722
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:32,100
They'd have let me go,
they wouldn't have stopped me!

723
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:44,800
I wish your parents were alive.

724
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:48,000
I wish!

725
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:17,000
I'm sorry, Grandma.

726
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:30,300
See these stars, Krishna...

727
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:37,700
...with these infinite
twinkling stars in the sky...

728
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:44,300
...you, your father, your grandfather...

729
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:46,300
...and I share a very deep relationship.

730
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:51,500
Your grandfather was a space scientist

731
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:58,800
One night, he started receiving a reply
to a signal he had sent to outer space

732
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:01,600
Suddenly, we saw a flying saucer in the sky...

733
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:03,800
...the car swerved out of control

734
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,700
I survived the accident...

735
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,300
...but your grandfather.

736
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:16,000
I was pregnant with Rohit at that time...

737
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:20,300
...he had sustained a head injury
in the accident...

738
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:23,500
...because of which he was born abnormal.

739
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:29,600
...even when he grew up,
he had the I.Q. of a child.

740
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:35,300
One night, in our small town,
a huge spaceship descended.

741
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:39,600
Some Aliens emerged from it...

742
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:42,500
...but one could not go back.

743
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:47,200
And that is how Rohit met Jadoo.

744
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:51,600
Jadoo had supernatural powers...

745
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:55,600
...which he passed on to Rohit.

746
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:58,600
Rohit changed completely.

747
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:01,600
Jadoo eventually went away...

748
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:07,700
...but he did not take back the powers
he had given to Rohit.

749
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:13,600
And thereafter, everything changed forever.

750
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:21,500
My son could do things that were impossible
for an ordinary human being.

751
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:27,200
It was around then that Rohit
married your mother.

752
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:33,800
And very soon, his fame spread
across the world.

753
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:39,300
The chairman of the world's largest
Information Technology Company...

754
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:42,000
...invited Rohit abroad.

755
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:50,800
Thank You.

756
01:05:57,500 --> 01:05:58,800
Welcome to Technotronics.

757
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:00,600
Come with me, Sir

758
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:11,300
Dr. Arya shall be here shortly

759
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:30,400
Mr. Rohit Mehra?

760
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:34,000
I'm sorry to keep you waiting

761
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:35,600
It's all right, Sir.

762
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:36,900
I was, this book...

763
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:42,500
Oh yes, that's the first copy of
my latest book.

764
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:44,800
Please read it and give your opinion.

765
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:48,000
It's a wonderful book, Sir.
You've done a lot of research.

766
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:51,200
How can you say that without reading it?

767
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:52,400
I've already read it, Sir.

768
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:55,300
Read it?

769
01:06:57,100 --> 01:07:00,900
There are printing errors on
page 126, 244 and 354

770
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:02,400
I've marked them.

771
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:07,500
You've read this 400 page book
in just 10 minutes?

772
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:13,800
I forgot who I was talking to.

773
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:17,900
Asking you such questions is
an insult to your talent.

774
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:20,400
It's an honor to meet you.

775
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:22,800
The honor is mine, Sir.

776
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:25,200
I still can't believe...

777
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:28,300
...that I'm standing face to face with a
great scientist and innovator like you.

778
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:31,000
Your achievements in the field of
wireless communication...

779
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:32,900
...is no less than a revolution, Sir.

780
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:36,400
You've invented the palmtop.

781
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:41,000
People can watch cricket matches
on their phones, thanks to you.

782
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:48,300
I have a new dream, Rohit. A new vision...

783
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:56,700
...lf this dream comes true, it could change
the destiny of the world.

784
01:07:58,100 --> 01:08:01,600
And I need your help to realize this dream.

785
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:08,600
I want to build a computer
that can see the future.

786
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:10,100
That can see the future.

787
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:13,700
Future?

788
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,400
What would you like, tea or coffee?

789
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:28,900
I understand your dream, your vision, Sir.

790
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:35,000
You want to combine astrology,
astronomy and technology...

791
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:38,800
...to build a computer that can see the future.

792
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:42,600
Exactly! That's precisely
why I've called you here.

793
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:46,800
Because the people I have here are trained...

794
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:49,700
...not gifted like you.

795
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:04,900
What are you thinking, Rohit?

796
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:13,800
Sir, if we can really build a computer
that can see the future then...

797
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:19,600
Then, think of the good we can do
for this planet and mankind!

798
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:21,100
Wars can be prevented

799
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:25,200
Earthquakes, famines, floods,
can be prevented.

800
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:28,100
Even if we can't prevent them,
we can at least be prepared for them.

801
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:31,300
You've already started
seeing the future, Rohit.

802
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:33,100
Welcome!

803
01:09:33,900 --> 01:09:39,600
In the hope that this union of brilliance
and vision will become history.

804
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:42,000
Create history!

805
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:47,300
It took him two whole years...

806
01:09:48,900 --> 01:09:52,900
...but Rohit achieved the impossible...

807
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:58,900
...he built a computer
that could see the future...

808
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:05,000
...It was around the time
when you were going to be born.

809
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:07,900
Hello? - Mom?

810
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:09,700
Rohit, I've brought Nisha to the hospital.

811
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:10,900
That's where I'm calling from.

812
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:14,100
Congratulations! You're going to
become a father anytime.

813
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:17,400
Come back soon.

814
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:19,600
I'm coming, Mom... I'm coming!

815
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:26,300
Rohit? What's the matter?
You sound tense.

816
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:30,500
I've been exploited. The world is very selfish

817
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:34,000
But don't worry! I'll be back soon!

818
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:37,300
But my son did not come back.

819
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:44,300
Moments after you were born,
we received word

820
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:48,700
...that a fire broke out in the lab...

821
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:55,400
...and they couldn't save Rohit.

822
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:01,500
Your mother couldn't bear the shock...

823
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:05,900
...and passed away in a few days.

824
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:11,100
When you were five years old...

825
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:17,800
...I got to know that you too were
born with extraordinary powers...

826
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:22,500
...that Rohit had. I got scared.

827
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:31,300
I didn't want the world to know about you.

828
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:35,000
And that's why I brought you here...

829
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:37,500
...a place where nobody knew us.

830
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:43,900
I didn't want to lose you at any cost, Krishna.

831
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:49,600
You no longer want to see my face...

832
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:55,700
...but I'm living only for you, Krishna

833
01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:04,800
Yes, I'm selfish, very selfish.

834
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:41,900
Grandma? What are you doing?

835
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:45,500
I've taken out some of
your father's clothes.

836
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:49,700
You can't go to Singapore like this!

837
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:55,100
But Grandma?

838
01:12:58,700 --> 01:13:00,700
I could shield you from the world...

839
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:03,300
...but not your heart.

840
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:08,500
Go, bring Priya here.

841
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:13,600
Krishna...

842
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:18,100
...stay carefully there

843
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:23,600
Eat and sleep on time,
don't talk too much with anybody.

844
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,100
And don't get into any trouble...

845
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:31,100
...whatever you do, make sure you
behave like any other man.

846
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:37,700
Don't get carried away to do things
that make people realize...

847
01:13:39,700 --> 01:13:42,600
Who I am? Right, Grandma?

848
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:45,000
Yes, my son.

849
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:48,200
Don't worry, Grandma.

850
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:51,400
I won't let anybody know about me.

851
01:13:52,300 --> 01:13:57,800
I'll keep my strength, my abilities
and my talent... hidden.

852
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:03,100
That's a promise, Grandma.

853
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:34,300
Welcome to Singapore, Sir.
- Thank you.

854
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:39,300
Your welcome sounds different...
and nicer, today.

855
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:23,800
Good afternoon, sir.

856
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,800
A very good afternoon, Dr. Mathur.

857
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:30,900
But sir...
- Yes, yes, I know...

858
01:15:31,100 --> 01:15:34,900
I've come a few days in advance.
But I couldn't help it.

859
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:36,100
I've waited so many years...

860
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:38,800
...but now that we're so close to success...

861
01:15:39,100 --> 01:15:43,000
...being patient is very difficult.

862
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:46,400
Must say you and your team deserve credit...

863
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:49,300
...for making my dream come true again.

864
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,700
Sir, the credit goes to Rohit Mehra...

865
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:56,200
If it wasn't for his notes and research...

866
01:15:56,700 --> 01:15:59,000
...it was impossible to build
that computer again.

867
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:03,500
Absolute genius! - You're right, sir

868
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:06,700
The computer that Rohit made in 2 years...

869
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:09,000
...has taken us so many years to make.

870
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:14,100
That's why I still miss him.

871
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:16,800
Excuse me

872
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:40,800
People say "Who has seen the future?"

873
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:47,600
But in a few days, you and I...

874
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:53,000
...will change this forever.

875
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:57,400
Breaking news!

876
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:00,700
After years of struggle, hard work,
research and patience...

877
01:17:00,900 --> 01:17:06,700
...Dr. Siddhant Arya's most ambitious project
is about to be completed.

878
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:11,000
According to our correspondent,
in just a few days...

879
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:15,200
...Dr. Arya will be able to predict the future of
individuals, countries and the world!

880
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:17,300
He'll also be able to change the
course of their destinies.

881
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:20,800
And the truth is, one who can see
and change the future...

882
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,300
...is considered like God!

883
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:26,700
Wrong!

884
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:31,100
Not Like God...

885
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:34,600
He is God!

886
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:40,000
I will be God.

887
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:44,200
Now no one can stop me.

888
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:20,300
We're already late and then
this is how you park the car?

889
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:22,300
I can't even open the door!
How am I going to get out?

890
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:24,400
But neither can I!

891
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:29,400
Great! Let's just sit in the car
and stare at each other!

892
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:32,300
You always mess things up!
Krishna's flight must have landed...

893
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:34,500
...he must be looking for us.

894
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,400
I'm sorry, Sir!

895
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:03,200
You're not hurt, are you?

896
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:24,100
Krishna

897
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:35,200
Krishna, you're looking
is so good in these clothes.

898
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:38,400
They are my fathers.

899
01:19:39,700 --> 01:19:43,200
Krishna, welcome to Singapore!

900
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:46,600
O my god! You look so handsome!

901
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:49,200
You two have come alone?

902
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:51,600
How can two people be 'alone'?

903
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:55,900
No! I mean, hasn't your mother
come with you?

904
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:56,800
Mother?

905
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:58,400
Is she also coming here?

906
01:19:58,800 --> 01:19:59,800
It would've been nice if she were here.

907
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:04,300
I'd have asked for your hand and
gone back to India immediately.

908
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,200
Grandma's all alone, you see.

909
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:08,700
He's in a tearing hurry!

910
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:11,000
Has he brought a priest along to
solemnize the wedding?

911
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:11,800
Shut up!

912
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:13,200
What happened?

913
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:17,000
Well actually, Mom, you know...

914
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:18,800
Her mom's gone.

915
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Yeah she's gone...

916
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:21,100
Gone?

917
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:23,200
To Hong Kong

918
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:24,100
Yes, Hong Kong!

919
01:20:24,300 --> 01:20:25,000
Hong Kong?

920
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:27,600
She'll be back in 10-15 days

921
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:28,900
Yes, she'll come.

922
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:33,100
10-15 days? But what will I do here
for so many days?

923
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:37,200
Why Krishna? Didn't you take us around
your village when we came there?

924
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:39,200
Now we'll show you our city.

925
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:43,800
This is your apartment.

926
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:46,000
This is your living room.

927
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:48,000
This is your bedroom

928
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:50,200
And these clothes are for you

929
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:51,900
This is your cell phone.

930
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:53,900
It has all our numbers.

931
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:56,200
You can call us anytime.

932
01:20:58,700 --> 01:21:02,000
But why can't I live with you
in your house, Priya?

933
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:04,200
Well...

934
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:06,900
Because mom...
...is not around

935
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,200
Yes! Mom's not around
wouldn't be proper

936
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:14,200
Hey! My phone is ringing!

937
01:21:14,900 --> 01:21:16,600
It says 'Mama' how do I take the call?

938
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,900
Looks like I gave you my cell phone
by mistake, Excuse me.

939
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:22,300
Hello Priya, I have good news!

940
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:24,100
I've found a boy for you.

941
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:26,600
I'm busy right now.
I'll call you later, Mama.

942
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:28,300
It was your mom's call?
Let me say hello to her.

943
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:30,000
No, it wasn't mom

944
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:32,600
It was my uncle.

945
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:34,500
I could've said hello to him.

946
01:21:34,700 --> 01:21:36,100
Does he live here too?

947
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:36,900
Yes...

948
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:39,900
No! He lives in India.

949
01:21:40,100 --> 01:21:41,700
I see, where in India?

950
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:44,400
Krishna, we've got to go to office.

951
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:47,100
We'll give you her uncle's address later.

952
01:21:47,300 --> 01:21:49,900
with pin code. But we've got to leave now. Bye!

953
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Bye! - Bye

954
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:56,900
How many lies do we have
to speak to cover up one lie?

955
01:21:57,100 --> 01:21:59,400
The excuse of an uncle saved us today!
- Tomorrow it'll be an aunt!

956
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:01,800
There is no dearth of relatives. Relax!

957
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:04,100
Did you see his eyes?

958
01:22:04,700 --> 01:22:06,700
They were full of love and trust.

959
01:22:07,300 --> 01:22:08,700
Honey, I can't do this!

960
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:10,600
I can't hurt Krishna anymore.

961
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:14,100
Hurt? He's going to become a
celebrity thanks to you.

962
01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:15,900
And we'll get a promotion.

963
01:22:16,100 --> 01:22:19,800
And even if he gets to know,
a small lie is not going to hurt him

964
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:22,800
What happened?

965
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:27,600
You? How did you get here from the 20th floor?

966
01:22:27,900 --> 01:22:28,400
I took the stairs.

967
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:30,000
Stairs?

968
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:36,300
Actually, Priya, I've got something for you...

969
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:39,300
What?

970
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:45,500
I'll go get the car ok?

971
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:51,200
Close your eyes.

972
01:22:53,100 --> 01:22:56,700
Priya, why do you widen your eyes
whenever I ask you to close them?

973
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:02,300
Open them now

974
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:08,500
May I put it on your finger?

975
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:14,700
Give me your hand

976
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:27,000
Looks nice?

977
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:29,500
Yes, now it looks nice.

978
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,800
Okay bye. - Bye

979
01:23:35,300 --> 01:23:36,400
What happened?

980
01:23:36,700 --> 01:23:39,000
I'll tell you later, lets go!

981
01:24:34,700 --> 01:24:36,500
No money- Okay

982
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:51,000
Brother!

983
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:10,200
Thank you.

984
01:26:11,700 --> 01:26:12,600
You're welcome

985
01:26:16,300 --> 01:26:18,300
Kristian Xuan Zhong Min Lee

986
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:19,400
What?

987
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,300
My name... too long

988
01:26:21,700 --> 01:26:24,200
Short? Kris Lee, okay?

989
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:25,800
Oh, okay! Kris Lee.

990
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:26,900
Nice name.

991
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:30,000
My name is Krishna... Krishna Mehra.

992
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:32,000
Krishna? India?

993
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:33,600
Yes, India

994
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:38,300
I work here in the Great Bombay Circus

995
01:26:40,900 --> 01:26:42,300
Must come, okay?

996
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:44,300
Okay.

997
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:45,600
Sunday, Okay?

998
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:47,500
Sunday, okay.

999
01:26:50,100 --> 01:26:52,200
Ten days will go by in no time.

1000
01:26:52,700 --> 01:26:55,200
Tell me how are you finding it there?

1001
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:56,300
Its very nice, Grandma.

1002
01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:57,800
There are a lot of high rise buildings here.

1003
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,400
And my apartment is on the 20th floor...

1004
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:03,100
And I'm talking to you from the balcony right now.

1005
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,900
Ok, ok, take care of yourself.

1006
01:27:06,100 --> 01:27:09,300
And give my love and blessings to Priya.

1007
01:27:09,700 --> 01:27:12,700
Just imagine! That's the
name of our new show.

1008
01:27:12,900 --> 01:27:18,900
Can you imagine a human being
climbing a tree faster than a monkey?

1009
01:27:19,100 --> 01:27:23,000
No... isn't it? Well after watching
our show today.

1010
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:26,500
You won't just imagine,
but also believe that is possible.

1011
01:27:26,700 --> 01:27:30,800
Get set then! On one end is the
world famous orangutan Mao...

1012
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:34,200
...who in a blink, will climb this pole.

1013
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:36,900
And on the other side is
Indian superboy Krishna!

1014
01:27:38,300 --> 01:27:38,900
What's happening here, Priya?

1015
01:27:39,100 --> 01:27:39,700
What happened?

1016
01:27:39,900 --> 01:27:41,800
You brought me here to watch a shoot!

1017
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:45,800
True. But then I thought if you can watch a shoot,
you can even perform in it!

1018
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,200
But how can I climb the pole faster than Mao?

1019
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:51,500
Like you climbed the mountain!
The zigzag manner... remember?

1020
01:27:51,700 --> 01:27:53,800
But what if I lose to Mao?

1021
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,700
I'm sure you won't.

1022
01:27:55,900 --> 01:27:56,900
But what if I do?

1023
01:27:57,500 --> 01:27:58,100
well...

1024
01:27:58,900 --> 01:28:00,100
I'll marry Mao then.

1025
01:28:02,700 --> 01:28:04,400
No! I'll never let that happen.

1026
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:06,800
So do it please! It'll be great fun.

1027
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:13,900
Fun it will be.

1028
01:28:14,900 --> 01:28:16,500
Sir we're ready

1029
01:28:16,700 --> 01:28:17,300
Ready is it?

1030
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:18,900
Chao, is Mao ready?

1031
01:28:19,100 --> 01:28:20,000
Ready

1032
01:28:21,300 --> 01:28:22,600
Krishna... Ready?

1033
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:28,200
Priya, there's just a pole's distance
between us and our success!

1034
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:30,100
Not a pole, it's just a moment. Stupid!

1035
01:28:30,300 --> 01:28:31,400
Taking

1036
01:28:43,100 --> 01:28:44,000
Roll camera

1037
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:46,300
Action

1038
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:53,900
Cut!

1039
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,800
What the hell is this?

1040
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:02,100
Boss, it's all about brotherhood

1041
01:29:02,300 --> 01:29:03,400
Shut up!

1042
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:04,600
Sorry, Sir

1043
01:29:05,300 --> 01:29:06,800
Come on Mao, come on

1044
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
Roll camera... Action

1045
01:29:12,700 --> 01:29:13,300
Cut!

1046
01:29:15,900 --> 01:29:19,400
You stupid ape! I've paid a lot
of money for you, okay?

1047
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:21,500
And I'm tired of you monkeying around

1048
01:29:21,700 --> 01:29:24,900
You don't get your act together;
you're out of my show. Okay?

1049
01:29:28,700 --> 01:29:30,600
I've straightened a lot of these smart alecs

1050
01:29:40,700 --> 01:29:41,700
Roll camera!

1051
01:29:42,700 --> 01:29:43,400
Action.

1052
01:29:51,900 --> 01:29:53,100
Where is the fish?

1053
01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:54,100
Cut!

1054
01:30:03,700 --> 01:30:04,700
Roll camera!

1055
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:06,600
Action.

1056
01:30:22,700 --> 01:30:24,300
I'm not going to the circus with you.

1057
01:30:24,500 --> 01:30:27,100
Strange! Why vent your
anger against Mao, on me?

1058
01:30:27,300 --> 01:30:29,100
How can I help it if he refused
to climb the pole?

1059
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:32,700
And the fish... instead of
coming into my hand...

1060
01:30:32,900 --> 01:30:35,100
They palmed off a can, a shoe and that...

1061
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
Wow! Priya smile!

1062
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:47,100
In India you caught the fish so easily!

1063
01:30:47,300 --> 01:30:49,900
Actually those fish knew me,
they stood by me.

1064
01:30:50,100 --> 01:30:52,100
But you're not standing by me!

1065
01:30:53,900 --> 01:30:56,200
I've come to stand by you for life, Priya.

1066
01:30:56,900 --> 01:30:59,300
For life? When my mother asks
you what you do?

1067
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:00,800
What will you say?

1068
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:02,100
I'll tell her what I do

1069
01:31:02,600 --> 01:31:03,500
Love you.

1070
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:06,800
And... what else will you say?

1071
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:10,500
I'll fulfill all your wishes, look after you.

1072
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:12,000
And?

1073
01:31:13,400 --> 01:31:15,700
I'll never let a smile leave your face.

1074
01:31:21,700 --> 01:31:22,500
And?

1075
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:24,900
Whether times good or bad
we'll always be together.

1076
01:31:26,100 --> 01:31:27,700
just like eyelashes are with the eyes.

1077
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:30,300
And?

1078
01:31:30,900 --> 01:31:34,100
You will dream and I'll fulfill them.

1079
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:37,200
And?

1080
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:39,400
In the scorching heat of the sun,
I'll be your shade.

1081
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:42,100
and in the cold, I'll give you warmth.

1082
01:31:43,100 --> 01:31:45,300
When the rains bother you, I'll change
the course of the clouds.

1083
01:31:46,100 --> 01:31:48,600
and when a storm blows...
I'll turn the winds away.

1084
01:31:57,700 --> 01:31:59,800
That's how I shall protect
you all my life...

1085
01:32:00,900 --> 01:32:01,800
from every danger.

1086
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:04,000
from every trouble.

1087
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:12,200
Now I hope your mother will agree?

1088
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:05,200
"If you haven't taken a heart"

1089
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:26,100
"if you haven't given your heart"

1090
01:33:32,900 --> 01:33:34,400
"If you haven't taken a heart"

1091
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:36,200
"if you haven't given your heart"

1092
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:39,500
"what have you ever done?"

1093
01:33:39,700 --> 01:33:41,300
"If you haven't taken a heart"

1094
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:44,000
"if you haven't given your heart"

1095
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:46,500
"what have you ever done?"

1096
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:49,900
"what have you done in this world?"

1097
01:33:50,100 --> 01:33:53,300
"If you've never fallen in love"

1098
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:56,900
"what have you done in this world?"

1099
01:33:57,100 --> 01:34:00,500
"If you've never fallen in love"

1100
01:34:48,700 --> 01:34:52,000
"you have set foot, On the moon"

1101
01:34:52,200 --> 01:34:56,100
"you've made an abode, in the seas"

1102
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:05,900
"But have you taught those crying"

1103
01:35:06,100 --> 01:35:09,700
"how to laugh?"

1104
01:35:16,900 --> 01:35:19,600
"Even God will smile and ask you one day"

1105
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:25,400
"heart"

1106
01:35:27,200 --> 01:35:28,700
"If you haven't taken a heart"

1107
01:35:28,900 --> 01:35:30,400
"if you haven't given your heart"

1108
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:33,800
"what have you ever done?"

1109
01:35:34,100 --> 01:35:35,600
"If you haven't taken a heart"

1110
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:37,400
"if you haven't given your heart"

1111
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:40,500
"what have you ever done?"

1112
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:44,300
"what have you done in this world?"

1113
01:35:44,500 --> 01:35:47,700
"If you've never fallen in love"

1114
01:35:47,900 --> 01:35:51,200
"what have you done in this world?"

1115
01:35:51,400 --> 01:35:54,900
"If you've never fallen in love"

1116
01:36:13,500 --> 01:36:16,900
"Life's also a circus"

1117
01:36:17,100 --> 01:36:21,000
"straight now, upside down in a moment"

1118
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:27,300
"Those who get love have things
straightened out"

1119
01:36:27,400 --> 01:36:31,200
"else, they keep hanging"

1120
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:41,000
"It's the simple truth, believe it"

1121
01:36:45,100 --> 01:36:46,700
"Heart..."

1122
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:50,400
"If you haven't taken a heart"

1123
01:36:52,100 --> 01:36:53,900
"if you haven't given your heart"

1124
01:36:55,500 --> 01:36:57,000
"If you haven't taken a heart"

1125
01:36:57,200 --> 01:36:58,800
"if you haven't given your heart"

1126
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:02,400
"what have you ever done?"

1127
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:05,700
"what have you done in this world?"

1128
01:37:05,900 --> 01:37:08,900
"If you've never fallen in love"

1129
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:30,200
"One more time"

1130
01:37:31,100 --> 01:37:34,300
"If you haven't taken a heart"

1131
01:37:34,500 --> 01:37:37,200
"if you haven't given your heart"

1132
01:38:09,900 --> 01:38:11,500
Fire! Help!

1133
01:38:14,300 --> 01:38:15,000
Priya...

1134
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:18,800
My daughter...

1135
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,300
My daughter, she's trapped inside

1136
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:24,700
please somebody save my daughter

1137
01:38:30,900 --> 01:38:33,500
Help! Help! Mummy papa Help!

1138
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:37,000
Somebody save my sister's life!

1139
01:38:38,600 --> 01:38:40,900
Is anybody there? Help me!

1140
01:38:43,200 --> 01:38:48,300
I'll keep my strength, my abilities
and my talent... hidden

1141
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,700
That's a promise, Grandma.

1142
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:20,200
Help! Help!

1143
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:29,900
Somebody help! Help me somebody!

1144
01:39:41,800 --> 01:39:43,700
Please help, help!

1145
01:39:50,300 --> 01:39:53,000
Help! Help!

1146
01:39:59,200 --> 01:40:01,400
Somebody help, Mummy Papa!

1147
01:40:26,700 --> 01:40:27,200
Look!

1148
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,100
Mummy, Papa!

1149
01:40:37,900 --> 01:40:39,000
Our daughter is inside,

1150
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:40,600
Please save our daughter, sir...

1151
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:42,400
Please save my child!

1152
01:40:42,700 --> 01:40:45,700
I beg of you, sir. Please! save
our daughter sir.

1153
01:40:45,900 --> 01:40:46,600
Please!

1154
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:10,200
Help! Help!

1155
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:11,900
Somebody help!

1156
01:41:27,900 --> 01:41:28,500
Help!

1157
01:41:28,900 --> 01:41:29,600
Help!

1158
01:41:32,200 --> 01:41:32,800
Come!

1159
01:41:35,700 --> 01:41:36,300
Come!

1160
01:41:37,100 --> 01:41:38,600
Who... who are you?

1161
01:41:39,300 --> 01:41:40,100
Krrish

1162
01:41:43,500 --> 01:41:44,100
Friend

1163
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:46,400
Friend

1164
01:42:56,400 --> 01:42:57,100
Priya!

1165
01:42:59,200 --> 01:43:00,100
Are you all right?

1166
01:43:01,200 --> 01:43:02,300
But how did you get here?

1167
01:43:02,500 --> 01:43:03,600
You had fainted.

1168
01:43:04,300 --> 01:43:05,900
I had gone to get some water for you...

1169
01:43:06,300 --> 01:43:08,300
God! What a blaze! Come,
let's go home.

1170
01:43:19,400 --> 01:43:21,400
The most sensational news in
Singapore right now

1171
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:24,600
is the circus blaze at Marina Bay
which took place last night

1172
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:29,300
and the daredevil masked man savior who, in a
flash, rescued many victims trapped in the fire

1173
01:43:29,500 --> 01:43:34,500
and has become every child's hero overnight but
his identity is still shrouded in mystery.

1174
01:43:34,900 --> 01:43:38,500
Till yesterday, we only had a description
and a picture of the masked man.

1175
01:43:39,100 --> 01:43:40,600
Today, we've got to know his name

1176
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:44,900
and also got a piece of his mask.
Let's find out how.

1177
01:43:45,700 --> 01:43:47,200
He said his name is Krrish

1178
01:43:47,400 --> 01:43:50,200
and this piece of the mask broke
from his forehead.

1179
01:43:50,400 --> 01:43:51,600
So his name is Krrish!

1180
01:43:51,800 --> 01:43:52,600
KRRISH!

1181
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:55,500
But his identity is still shrouded
in mystery.

1182
01:43:55,700 --> 01:44:02,800
Whoever Krrish is, a bravery award
and cash reward of 25000 dollars...

1183
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:04,400
has been announced in appreciation
of his courage.

1184
01:44:04,600 --> 01:44:06,600
So how are we going to identify Krrish?

1185
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:10,800
The one, whose mask this piece matches with,
will be considered to be Krrish.

1186
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,500
And he'll be the one to be rewarded.

1187
01:44:13,700 --> 01:44:17,600
Krrish! Krrish! After all who is this Krrish?

1188
01:44:18,700 --> 01:44:22,000
Listen carefully, our priority
at the moment is Krrish.

1189
01:44:22,200 --> 01:44:25,200
Only Krrish! Get that?

1190
01:44:25,500 --> 01:44:27,400
Krrish's identity...

1191
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:30,800
Our channel should be the
first to reveal him!

1192
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:32,200
Do you get that?

1193
01:44:41,400 --> 01:44:45,800
Our channel must be the first one to
unmask this masked Krrish!

1194
01:44:46,200 --> 01:44:50,500
Get it? Stop nodding and leave!
Go, get him! Go, go!

1195
01:44:53,400 --> 01:44:55,000
Where are the two of you going?

1196
01:44:55,200 --> 01:44:56,300
To look for Krrish.

1197
01:44:56,500 --> 01:44:59,600
Ah, forget Krrish. And look for a new job.

1198
01:45:00,200 --> 01:45:01,000
New job?

1199
01:45:01,900 --> 01:45:03,000
You both are fired.

1200
01:45:03,200 --> 01:45:03,900
What?

1201
01:45:05,200 --> 01:45:06,100
You better go back to India...

1202
01:45:06,300 --> 01:45:09,100
and enjoy your Krishna's flute playing.

1203
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:11,400
Don't waste your time, Go, go!

1204
01:45:12,300 --> 01:45:13,300
Out!

1205
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:17,000
Thanks to Krishna we're jobless.

1206
01:45:17,400 --> 01:45:18,700
Now what do we do?

1207
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:25,200
Honey, I think Krrish is none other
than our own Krishna.

1208
01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:26,500
What?

1209
01:45:26,900 --> 01:45:27,400
Yes, Honey!

1210
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:31,800
At the circus, I saw Krrish from
such a close distance.

1211
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:35,900
I have a strong feeling that Krishna is Krrish.

1212
01:45:37,100 --> 01:45:39,900
So why didn't you tell this to
boss at the meeting?

1213
01:45:40,100 --> 01:45:44,200
Because I wasn't sure, I need
to confirm it first.

1214
01:45:44,500 --> 01:45:46,200
Confirm? How?

1215
01:45:47,700 --> 01:45:50,300
Listen, I have an idea...

1216
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:56,000
Honey, these guys?

1217
01:46:56,200 --> 01:46:58,100
Priya! I've hired some actors.
But I'm a bit late...

1218
01:46:58,300 --> 01:46:59,300
I'll be there soon.

1219
01:46:59,500 --> 01:47:00,100
What?

1220
01:47:03,200 --> 01:47:04,100
So who are these guys?

1221
01:47:05,500 --> 01:47:08,200
Oh my God! Help!

1222
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:29,700
This is now mine... bye!

1223
01:47:38,200 --> 01:47:41,600
I'm so sorry, Krishna. I'm so sorry.

1224
01:47:42,600 --> 01:47:47,700
I thought you were Krrish and
planned my own kidnapping.

1225
01:47:49,400 --> 01:47:53,000
But then, real goons turned up
instead of the hired ones.

1226
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:56,000
Real goons?

1227
01:48:00,400 --> 01:48:02,200
But why didn't you hit back?

1228
01:48:05,100 --> 01:48:07,300
Why did you quietly take their beating?

1229
01:48:09,900 --> 01:48:10,900
I wanted to see...

1230
01:48:12,900 --> 01:48:18,100
whether it hurts you to see me in pain.

1231
01:48:22,100 --> 01:48:22,900
It does.

1232
01:48:35,400 --> 01:48:36,300
Where's your ring?

1233
01:48:37,900 --> 01:48:39,200
Maybe they've...

1234
01:49:26,700 --> 01:49:30,200
Who's he? Why's he here?

1235
01:49:31,400 --> 01:49:34,200
I think he's the masked man.

1236
01:49:36,200 --> 01:49:38,500
Masked man?

1237
01:49:52,200 --> 01:49:53,000
Get him.

1238
01:51:14,100 --> 01:51:15,500
I'm sorry, sorry.

1239
01:51:54,500 --> 01:51:56,800
My friend Krrish!

1240
01:51:59,600 --> 01:52:03,800
I'll tell everyone, I'll tell my sister.

1241
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:07,900
No, Kristian. Don't tell anyone.

1242
01:52:08,100 --> 01:52:13,400
Why? You become famous!
You'll get the reward.

1243
01:52:17,700 --> 01:52:20,900
Here, Kristian. You become Krrish.

1244
01:52:24,700 --> 01:52:30,000
Take it. Get the money for your sister.

1245
01:52:31,600 --> 01:52:32,900
Make her legs good again.

1246
01:52:35,300 --> 01:52:36,100
Take it!

1247
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:47,800
No, it's yours. You are the hero.

1248
01:52:49,600 --> 01:52:53,400
Every human being who fights for a
good cause is a hero, Kristian.

1249
01:52:54,600 --> 01:52:57,000
You... are fighting for your sister.

1250
01:52:59,600 --> 01:53:00,700
You are a hero.

1251
01:53:05,800 --> 01:53:07,000
The biggest news of today!

1252
01:53:07,200 --> 01:53:09,800
Superhero Krrish has revealed his
identity to the media...

1253
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,200
and the broken piece of the mask
fitting his mask

1254
01:53:12,400 --> 01:53:14,100
has confirmed his identity

1255
01:53:14,300 --> 01:53:17,700
Here today, Hero Honda is honoring
Krrish for his bravery

1256
01:53:20,400 --> 01:53:20,900
Well done young man.

1257
01:53:21,100 --> 01:53:21,600
Thank you

1258
01:53:40,900 --> 01:53:44,800
Not once did it occur to me that
Kristian could also be Krrish!

1259
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:46,800
He was also there at the circus that night!

1260
01:53:47,800 --> 01:53:50,600
Had it struck me that night

1261
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:52,200
I wouldn't have got a thrashing!

1262
01:53:54,300 --> 01:53:56,300
I've said sorry, haven't I?

1263
01:53:56,600 --> 01:53:57,800
What else do you want me to do?

1264
01:54:00,100 --> 01:54:01,200
Close your eyes...

1265
01:54:02,300 --> 01:54:03,400
again you...

1266
01:54:08,900 --> 01:54:09,800
Now open them.

1267
01:54:11,800 --> 01:54:13,100
How did you get it back?

1268
01:54:13,300 --> 01:54:15,600
Krrish, he's my friend.

1269
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:16,800
Wouldn't he do this much for me?

1270
01:54:20,400 --> 01:54:21,600
Thank you, thank you

1271
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:31,500
Take it

1272
01:54:32,800 --> 01:54:35,000
Won't you put it on my finger?

1273
01:55:02,100 --> 01:55:05,800
"where the rays of the sun come from"

1274
01:55:08,600 --> 01:55:11,600

1275

01:56:10,200 --> 01:56:13,900
"there's no one like you"

1291
01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:43,900
"Flower, butterflies, the buds..."

1292
01:56:44,100 --> 01:56:47,700
"they're all sulking"

1293
01:56:49,900 --> 01:56:53,700
"Flower, butterflies, the buds..."

1294
01:56:53,900 --> 01:56:57,100
"they're all sulking"

1295
01:56:57,300 --> 01:57:00,300
"From them you have stolen..."

1296
01:57:00,500 --> 01:57:03,700
"their ability to evoke love"

1297
01:57:03,900 --> 01:57:06,900
"their ability to evoke love"

1298
01:57:07,100 --> 01:57:11,200
"Where colors are created"

1299
01:57:13,500 --> 01:57:16,700
"Where colors are created"

1300
01:57:16,900 --> 01:57:20,100
"Where colors are created"

1301
01:57:20,200 --> 01:57:23,200
"and beauty is crafted"

1302

"there's no one like you"

1306
01:57:39,100 --> 01:57:43,000
"there's no one like you"

1307
01:58:16,100 --> 01:58:19,300
"You have stolen my heart"

1308
01:58:19,500 --> 01:58:23,500
"do you realize that"

1309
01:58:26,100 --> 01:58:29,100
"You have stolen my heart"

1310
01:58:29,300 --> 01:58:32,400
"do you realize that"

1311
01:58:32,600 --> 01:58:39,100
"In you lies all the love in the world"

1312
01:58:39,300 --> 01:58:42,300
"In you it lies"

1313
01:58:42,500 --> 01:58:46,200
"Where people go crazy in love..."

1314

01:59:07,900 --> 01:59:11,200
"there's no one like you"

1320
01:59:11,400 --> 01:59:14,300
"there's no one like you"

1321
01:59:14,500 --> 01:59:17,900
"there's no one like you"

1322
01:59:58,400 --> 01:59:59,700
Priya!

1323
02:00:01,200 --> 02:00:02,100
Move from there.

1324
02:00:02,300 --> 02:00:07,300
Priya, you're watching TV here and there boss has
ordered to vacate Krishna's apartment.

1325
02:00:08,100 --> 02:00:10,900
Hello! Are you listening?

1326
02:00:11,100 --> 02:00:13,500
I am & am not.

1327
02:00:20,400 --> 02:00:21,800
What's this?

1328
02:00:22,700 --> 02:00:24,800
Remember the explosion at the circus?

1329
02:00:25,300 --> 02:00:28,200
I had passed out, but I think the
camera was still on.

1330
02:00:29,200 --> 02:00:32,500
Now switch off the TV and think
about Krishna! Please!

1331
02:00:37,700 --> 02:00:38,700
Oh my god!

1332
02:00:40,600 --> 02:00:41,400
What happened?

1333
02:00:41,600 --> 02:00:43,000
I'll rewind and show you.

1334
02:00:59,800 --> 02:01:01,300
Krishna is Krrish!

1335
02:01:07,500 --> 02:01:08,400
What happened?

1336
02:01:09,900 --> 02:01:11,200
Why are you girls screaming?

1337
02:01:12,300 --> 02:01:12,900
Where are you both going?

1338
02:01:13,100 --> 02:01:13,800
Mom Office! I'll see you okay.

1339
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:14,400
Office?

1340
02:01:14,600 --> 02:01:15,500
Come on Honey

1341
02:01:15,700 --> 02:01:16,500
To get our jobs back!

1342
02:01:16,600 --> 02:01:17,400
Ok bye!

1343
02:01:19,300 --> 02:01:20,800
Priya, your mobile.

1344
02:01:21,800 --> 02:01:22,600
Hello Priya?

1345
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:24,800
No, I'm Priya's mother

1346
02:01:26,300 --> 02:01:29,000
Mother... hello.

1347
02:01:29,400 --> 02:01:31,200
When did you return from Hong Kong?

1348
02:01:31,400 --> 02:01:35,200
Hong Kong? I didn't go anywhere...
I've been right here

1349
02:01:35,400 --> 02:01:37,200
And who are you?

1350
02:01:37,900 --> 02:01:40,700
It's me, Krishna.

1351
02:01:41,200 --> 02:01:42,300
Krishna, who?

1352
02:01:44,300 --> 02:01:47,300
Priya has told you everything about me,
hasn't she?

1353
02:01:47,900 --> 02:01:51,000
No, Priya has said nothing about you.

1354
02:01:55,200 --> 02:01:57,100
You are Priya's mother aren't you?

1355
02:01:57,500 --> 02:01:59,400
Yes... I'm Priya's mother.

1356
02:02:01,400 --> 02:02:02,300
Where's Priya?

1357
02:02:02,500 --> 02:02:04,200
Priya left for office just now.

1358
02:02:06,400 --> 02:02:07,600
Office...

1359
02:02:07,800 --> 02:02:08,800
Right... Thank you

1360
02:02:13,300 --> 02:02:19,700
Priya, do you realize? Once this
footage is telecast...

1361
02:02:21,200 --> 02:02:25,200
Our Krishna will become a
world famous celebrity!

1362
02:02:26,200 --> 02:02:28,100
There's something about our Krishna!

1363
02:02:28,500 --> 02:02:30,700
He fooled us so convincingly.

1364
02:02:30,900 --> 02:02:33,800
In India, as Kalicharan, and here, as Krrish!

1365
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:37,000
Didn't I tell you Honey, the truth
always comes out?

1366
02:02:39,700 --> 02:02:42,800
Look Priya, the truth about Krishna
the world is about to discover...

1367
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:44,100
...is because you lied!

1368
02:02:44,300 --> 02:02:48,400
The lie that you love him brought him
here all the way from India.

1369
02:02:48,600 --> 02:02:52,100
And imagine! Now we're going to
create a big sensation!

1370
02:02:53,100 --> 02:02:56,300
You're right. A lie sometimes leads
to very big gains.

1371
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,300
You didn't even tell me!

1372
02:03:20,700 --> 02:03:21,800
What could I say?

1373
02:03:23,500 --> 02:03:27,800
When his honesty turned my feigned
love into a genuine one...

1374
02:03:29,800 --> 02:03:31,200
I didn't even realize

1375
02:03:34,400 --> 02:03:36,100
I'm in love with Krishna, Honey

1376
02:03:45,500 --> 02:03:47,500
Krishna, Krishna

1377
02:03:49,900 --> 02:03:51,500
The culprit has been caught at last!

1378
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,900
He did his best to hide his identity, you know

1379
02:03:56,400 --> 02:03:59,800
But I finally discovered who the real Krrish is!

1380
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:02,400
Why did you lie to me?

1381
02:04:03,500 --> 02:04:05,100
Why did you keep me in the dark?

1382
02:04:06,500 --> 02:04:09,300
Where was the need to hide behind
a mask, even with me?

1383
02:04:13,800 --> 02:04:15,000
You're asking this Priya?

1384
02:04:17,100 --> 02:04:18,900
Someone who has never been honest with me

1385
02:04:21,200 --> 02:04:23,300
Someone who kept me in the dark till today

1386
02:04:26,300 --> 02:04:27,900
I have been unmasked Priya.

1387
02:04:33,800 --> 02:04:34,700
What about you?

1388
02:04:37,100 --> 02:04:38,100
What do you mean?

1389
02:04:39,800 --> 02:04:41,900
Why did you lie to me that you loved me?

1390
02:04:43,800 --> 02:04:46,300
I took your lies for the truth and came here.

1391
02:04:47,400 --> 02:04:49,000
to ask your mother for your hand in marriage

1392
02:04:52,100 --> 02:04:54,400
But you lied about her too!

1393
02:04:56,200 --> 02:04:57,000
yes, Priya

1394
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:00,600
I've spoken to your mother

1395
02:05:05,500 --> 02:05:06,200
Krishna...

1396
02:05:08,200 --> 02:05:09,100
I'm sorry

1397
02:05:11,600 --> 02:05:13,800
I admit, I lied to you in the beginning

1398
02:05:14,600 --> 02:05:15,300
But now...

1399
02:05:18,400 --> 02:05:20,100
I really love you Krishna

1400
02:05:20,300 --> 02:05:23,000
Stop it, Priya! Stop it!

1401
02:05:24,200 --> 02:05:26,300
you may have more lies to tell me

1402
02:05:28,200 --> 02:05:30,500
But I don't have the strength to take
them for the truth anymore!

1403
02:05:30,700 --> 02:05:34,300
Listen to me, Krishna! I've done
all this only for you

1404
02:05:34,500 --> 02:05:36,600
I wanted to see you become
a very big man

1405
02:05:36,800 --> 02:05:38,500
and that's about to happen in
just a few hours

1406
02:05:38,700 --> 02:05:40,900
the whole world will get to know about
your extraordinary powers and talent

1407
02:05:41,100 --> 02:05:42,400
that's exactly what I didn't want

1408
02:05:43,400 --> 02:05:45,900
Why do you think I wore the mask?

1409
02:05:47,100 --> 02:05:50,700
because I had promised grandma that
I'd keep my identity hidden

1410
02:05:51,600 --> 02:05:53,900
that I would not let anyone know
about my powers

1411
02:05:56,100 --> 02:05:57,000
and you

1412
02:06:02,100 --> 02:06:03,400
grandma was right

1413
02:06:04,500 --> 02:06:07,600
people in the world only use each other
for their own selfish reasons

1414
02:06:10,100 --> 02:06:11,400
She tried to stop me, but I...

1415
02:06:11,600 --> 02:06:13,800
But why does your grandmother
want to stop you?

1416
02:06:15,100 --> 02:06:17,900
Why does she always want you
in front of her eyes?

1417
02:06:19,600 --> 02:06:22,300
Why doesn't she want the whole
world to know of your talent?

1418
02:06:23,300 --> 02:06:24,100
Is she not being selfish?

1419
02:06:24,300 --> 02:06:24,900
Priya!

1420
02:06:29,200 --> 02:06:30,300
You really want to know?

1421
02:06:31,900 --> 02:06:32,900
Then listen!

1422
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:55,300
having lost her son, grandma
did not want to lose me

1423
02:06:55,500 --> 02:06:56,800
because I posses the same powers

1424
02:07:04,100 --> 02:07:05,700
but she still let me come here

1425
02:07:07,900 --> 02:07:08,800
for you

1426
02:07:10,500 --> 02:07:12,700
for my feelings, she gave in

1427
02:07:17,100 --> 02:07:18,800
But what do I tell her now?

1428
02:07:24,900 --> 02:07:27,100
Krishna, listen to me... Krishna!

1429
02:07:27,900 --> 02:07:30,300
Krishna...

1430
02:07:38,900 --> 02:07:40,500
Hello Honey

1431
02:07:40,700 --> 02:07:42,300
We've got to stop the telecast
of Krishna's tape

1432
02:07:42,500 --> 02:07:43,100
Why?

1433
02:07:43,700 --> 02:07:46,600
don't ask questions now, just
stop the telecast

1434
02:07:46,900 --> 02:07:48,900
but the tape is with boss

1435
02:07:50,500 --> 02:07:52,500
My god, where's boss?

1436
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:11,000
I wish to thank all my investors
in Singapore

1437
02:08:11,800 --> 02:08:14,400
they are the ones who really
deserve this applause

1438
02:08:14,600 --> 02:08:17,000
for having had faith in my
various projects

1439
02:08:18,600 --> 02:08:22,600
I'm delighted to announce that
our company, Technotronics...

1440
02:08:22,800 --> 02:08:26,700
has made a profit of 400 million
dollars this year

1441
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:30,300
I therefore announce 100% dividend

1442
02:08:30,500 --> 02:08:32,400
to all our shareholders

1443
02:08:34,900 --> 02:08:36,400
Any questions?

1444
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:39,600
Yes?

1445
02:08:41,700 --> 02:08:45,600
Dr. Arya, congratulations on the phenomenal
success of your company

1446
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:47,200
my question is

1447
02:08:47,600 --> 02:08:50,900
20 years ago, you tried to make a computer

1448
02:08:51,100 --> 02:08:52,700
that could see the future

1449
02:08:54,800 --> 02:08:57,000
What happened to that dream of yours?

1450
02:09:00,600 --> 02:09:03,800
20 years ago, you must have had
a lot of dreams too...

1451
02:09:04,500 --> 02:09:05,900
Did they all come true?

1452
02:09:06,800 --> 02:09:07,300
Pardon me?

1453
02:09:08,400 --> 02:09:11,200
some questions hurt

1454
02:09:12,400 --> 02:09:14,300
the media ought to understand

1455
02:09:16,500 --> 02:09:22,900
that dream died with the death of my
genius friend, Rohit Mehra

1456
02:09:24,200 --> 02:09:27,500
But from what I've read and
heard of you, Dr. Arya...

1457
02:09:27,900 --> 02:09:29,600
you don't ever accept defeat

1458
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:31,800
I'd have tried to win...

1459
02:09:33,200 --> 02:09:37,200
had my genius friend been alive

1460
02:09:39,800 --> 02:09:40,900
Any further questions?

1461
02:09:42,500 --> 02:09:43,400
excuse me

1462
02:09:43,600 --> 02:09:45,800
sir, I need to speak to that lady
for just one minute

1463
02:09:49,700 --> 02:09:50,400
Please!

1464
02:09:58,300 --> 02:09:59,000
Krishna

1465
02:10:06,600 --> 02:10:07,900
Anything left to say?

1466
02:10:10,700 --> 02:10:14,800
Yes... This gentleman has
something to say

1467
02:10:20,700 --> 02:10:21,400
Who are you?

1468
02:10:22,600 --> 02:10:23,900
My name is Vikram Sinha

1469
02:10:25,600 --> 02:10:26,400
What do you want?

1470
02:10:26,900 --> 02:10:32,200
Don't go back the way you came.

1471
02:10:33,100 --> 02:10:33,900
What does that mean?

1472
02:10:34,100 --> 02:10:36,600
I mean, you came alone

1473
02:10:37,400 --> 02:10:38,400
don't go back alone.

1474
02:10:44,100 --> 02:10:47,100
Krishna, your father, Rohit Mehra,
is still alive.

1475
02:10:57,600 --> 02:10:58,500
What did you say?

1476
02:11:05,700 --> 02:11:10,000
This picture was taken when
your father worked for Dr. Arya

1477
02:11:10,700 --> 02:11:13,400
And I was the Senior Security
Officer at Technotronics.

1478
02:11:14,500 --> 02:11:16,100
He was younger to me in age,

1479
02:11:16,700 --> 02:11:18,400
and I was a junior in status.

1480
02:11:19,300 --> 02:11:20,800
And yet, we were very close friends.

1481
02:11:21,900 --> 02:11:23,800
not only because we were Indians

1482
02:11:24,900 --> 02:11:27,300
it was because of the sincerity in his smile

1483
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:30,500
and the honesty in his eyes.

1484
02:11:32,500 --> 02:11:33,900
He was always smiling...

1485
02:11:37,800 --> 02:11:40,700
but someone cast an evil eye on him.

1486
02:11:42,400 --> 02:11:43,600
It's been so many years,

1487
02:11:45,200 --> 02:11:46,300
but that time...

1488
02:11:47,800 --> 02:11:49,400
seems to have frozen.

1489
02:11:50,400 --> 02:11:52,700
That day, he was working till morning...

1490
02:11:53,200 --> 02:11:56,000
because he had to complete his
project and go back to India.

1491
02:11:56,700 --> 02:11:57,700
Good morning, chief

1492
02:11:58,800 --> 02:12:01,300
Mr. Vikram? Welcome!

1493
02:12:01,500 --> 02:12:02,500
How are you this morning?

1494
02:12:02,700 --> 02:12:04,000
I'm doing fine, chief

1495
02:12:04,500 --> 02:12:09,400
but if you keep working round the clock like this,
you're going to get insomnia

1496
02:12:10,800 --> 02:12:12,900
I won't have to do it after today.

1497
02:12:13,900 --> 02:12:15,800
Once the computer is inaugurated today...

1498
02:12:16,100 --> 02:12:20,500
I'll hand it over to Dr. Arya and return
to my family in India.

1499
02:12:22,200 --> 02:12:23,700
Don't mind, chief...

1500
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:27,100
but I still can't believe that we
can see the future.

1501
02:12:27,400 --> 02:12:29,800
Not believing does not change
the truth, Mr. Vikram.

1502
02:12:30,700 --> 02:12:32,700
You will believe it, when you see it?

1503
02:12:32,900 --> 02:12:35,200
What? You mean you're going to...

1504
02:12:35,400 --> 02:12:36,400
Of course!

1505
02:12:37,600 --> 02:12:41,000
Come see tomorrow, today

1506
02:12:41,500 --> 02:12:44,300
and tell me how it feels to see the future.

1507
02:12:44,700 --> 02:12:45,500
Please hold this.

1508
02:13:07,200 --> 02:13:09,600
Retina scan, an identification of my eyes

1509
02:13:44,800 --> 02:13:47,300
These 2 identifications of mine are
the password for this computer.

1510
02:13:47,500 --> 02:13:49,100
Without which, it won't start up.

1511
02:13:49,900 --> 02:13:54,200
But when you're not around, when
you've gone back to India?

1512
02:13:54,400 --> 02:13:56,800
I'll change the password before I leave

1513
02:13:57,000 --> 02:14:00,000
After that, only Dr. Arya will be able
to start the computer.

1514
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:03,700
Tell me...

1515
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:06,300
What would you like to see?

1516
02:14:06,600 --> 02:14:08,200
I... I don't want to see anything, chief!

1517
02:14:08,900 --> 02:14:11,300
But you said your wife is pregnant

1518
02:14:12,600 --> 02:14:16,400
Let's see whether I'm going to be an
uncle to a nephew or a niece?

1519
02:14:18,400 --> 02:14:21,500
Ok then... let's find out.

1520
02:14:48,500 --> 02:14:49,100
Nisha!

1521
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:53,600
Nisha!

1522
02:14:55,200 --> 02:14:56,800
My darling baby...

1523
02:14:59,400 --> 02:15:02,500
Look, Nisha, your son looks just like Rohit.

1524
02:15:02,700 --> 02:15:09,200
Now go to your Mom. My son's
coming back to me.

1525
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:15,200
Congratulations, chief! Your wife's
going to deliver a baby boy tomorrow!

1526
02:15:15,500 --> 02:15:18,200
But I'm going to distribute sweets
today! In fact, right now?

1527
02:15:18,400 --> 02:15:19,200
What did you say?

1528
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:21,300
What happened to my Rohit?

1529
02:15:21,700 --> 02:15:22,600
What happened, Mom?

1530
02:15:23,100 --> 02:15:25,800
No! That's impossible!

1531
02:15:26,600 --> 02:15:28,100
My Rohit can't be dead!

1532
02:15:29,400 --> 02:15:30,600
My Rohit is alive!

1533
02:15:30,900 --> 02:15:31,400
No!

1534
02:15:32,200 --> 02:15:32,800
No!

1535
02:15:33,900 --> 02:15:34,700
Which means, I...

1536
02:15:35,200 --> 02:15:39,500
Chief, the computer's malfunctioning!
Something's wrong with it!

1537
02:16:06,500 --> 02:16:07,500
Dr. Arya!

1538
02:16:08,900 --> 02:16:13,700
It's 6:40 there, it's 6:30 now!
This means, in just 10 minutes!

1539
02:16:13,900 --> 02:16:14,800
in this very room!

1540
02:16:20,300 --> 02:16:21,500
Look! Dr. Arya!

1541
02:16:22,900 --> 02:16:25,300
Have you heard of Shahjahan, Doctor Mathur?

1542
02:16:25,500 --> 02:16:27,300
Of course! He built the Taj Mahal.

1543
02:16:27,500 --> 02:16:29,100
Incomplete knowledge is always dangerous.

1544
02:16:29,500 --> 02:16:32,100
Shahjahan had the hands of workers
who built the Taj Mahal, chopped off!

1545
02:16:32,300 --> 02:16:34,500
so that there would never be another Taj Mahal.

1546
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:38,300
Rohit Mehra is a worker for me
and I'm his Shahjehan.

1547
02:16:39,200 --> 02:16:41,700
You mean, you're also going to
cut off Rohit's hands?

1548
02:16:41,900 --> 02:16:44,700
No... his brain!

1549
02:16:45,500 --> 02:16:50,900
because Rohit's brain will create problems,
for himself as well as for me.

1550
02:16:51,900 --> 02:16:55,100
Actually, I'm going to feel very sorry about
it because Rohit is a very good boy.

1551
02:16:55,300 --> 02:16:58,900
Sincere, honest, intelligent...

1552
02:16:59,100 --> 02:17:01,200
They're coming here, chief. Please leave!

1553
02:17:01,400 --> 02:17:03,800
No, no! I'm won't let this computer
go into the wrong hands.

1554
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:05,200
I'll destroy everything!

1555
02:17:05,600 --> 02:17:06,100
All right!

1556
02:17:06,300 --> 02:17:08,100
I'll try and stop them!

1557
02:17:12,600 --> 02:17:13,200
Hello!

1558
02:17:13,400 --> 02:17:14,000
Mom?

1559
02:17:14,300 --> 02:17:17,000
Rohit? I've brought Nisha to the hospital.

1560
02:17:17,200 --> 02:17:20,100
Congratulations! You're going to
become a father anytime.

1561
02:17:20,300 --> 02:17:22,100
Come home soon, son

1562
02:17:22,300 --> 02:17:24,300
I'm coming, Mom! I'm coming!

1563
02:17:24,500 --> 02:17:29,500
Rohit... What's the matter? You sound tense?

1564
02:17:29,900 --> 02:17:33,900
I've been exploited, the world is very selfish!

1565
02:17:34,100 --> 02:17:37,600
Don't worry, I'll be back, I'll be back soon.

1566
02:18:38,800 --> 02:18:39,900
Rohit!

1567
02:18:41,300 --> 02:18:43,000
What have you done?

1568
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:50,700
I've destroyed your dream...
I've destroyed everything!

1569
02:18:52,900 --> 02:18:55,000
because I've got to know of your intentions

1570
02:18:55,300 --> 02:19:01,700
But those who know me also
know that I never accept defeat.

1571
02:19:05,300 --> 02:19:07,100
I'll rebuild this computer

1572
02:19:08,100 --> 02:19:10,500
using your research.

1573
02:19:11,600 --> 02:19:14,400
But I don't need you anymore.

1574
02:19:17,300 --> 02:19:20,000
Thank you so much for everything, Rohit

1575
02:19:20,200 --> 02:19:21,000
Good bye

1576
02:19:22,200 --> 02:19:23,100
Hold it, sir!

1577
02:19:27,200 --> 02:19:29,300
Don't kill him, sir

1578
02:19:33,200 --> 02:19:38,300
If you kill Rohit... then even if you
build the computer again

1579
02:19:38,600 --> 02:19:41,100
you'll never be able to start it

1580
02:19:43,300 --> 02:19:46,000
You need a password to start the computer

1581
02:19:46,500 --> 02:19:48,900
and the password is Rohit himself.

1582
02:19:49,400 --> 02:19:50,000
What?

1583
02:19:50,600 --> 02:19:51,300
Yes, sir

1584
02:19:52,100 --> 02:19:53,600
I've seen it with my own eyes.

1585
02:19:54,500 --> 02:19:59,800
Until scans of his retina and heartbeat
are fed into the computer...

1586
02:20:00,600 --> 02:20:02,300
the computer will not start.

1587
02:20:10,300 --> 02:20:12,100
This means, I'll have to keep you alive

1588
02:20:12,900 --> 02:20:16,400
till I don't build a new computer.

1589
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,900
But die, you will.

1590
02:20:24,200 --> 02:20:25,300
For the world.

1591
02:20:29,800 --> 02:20:31,200
Breaking news.

1592
02:20:31,500 --> 02:20:33,200
Tragedy strikes!

1593
02:20:33,600 --> 02:20:36,500
Following a fire that broke out in
the lab of Technotronics...

1594
02:20:36,700 --> 02:20:41,200
The famous Indian genius Rohit Mehra
has met with a tragic death.

1595
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:47,700
Let's observe a 2-minute silence,
so that Rohit Mehra's soul rests in peace.

1596
02:20:58,700 --> 02:21:02,800
Ever since, I had no choice but
to work for Dr. Arya.

1597
02:21:04,400 --> 02:21:06,200
I couldn't even go to the police...

1598
02:21:08,600 --> 02:21:13,600
because if Dr. Arya doubted me,
he would've killed me.

1599
02:21:15,100 --> 02:21:17,700
And I was the only man who could
get in touch with your family.

1600
02:21:19,200 --> 02:21:23,000
That's exactly why I've been looking for your
grandma and you for so many years.

1601
02:21:24,400 --> 02:21:27,000
And finally, I met you today, through Priya.

1602
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:02,200
Dr. Arya

1603
02:22:06,800 --> 02:22:07,900
20 years...

1604
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:13,400
for 20 years, he's kept a
mother away from her son

1605
02:22:14,600 --> 02:22:16,700
and a son away from his father

1606
02:22:19,400 --> 02:22:21,700
It's because of his lies that I lost my mother.

1607
02:22:30,800 --> 02:22:31,800
Where is my father?

1608
02:22:32,200 --> 02:22:33,400
Here in Singapore.

1609
02:22:34,200 --> 02:22:38,000
For 20 years Dr. Arya has used
machines to keep him in a state

1610
02:22:38,200 --> 02:22:41,600
that only his brain is alive,
his body almost dead.

1611
02:22:45,300 --> 02:22:48,800
Good evening, my friend Rohit Mehra

1612
02:22:54,400 --> 02:22:56,200
How are you feeling today?

1613
02:22:58,800 --> 02:23:01,900
Are these machines taking good care of you?

1614
02:23:02,600 --> 02:23:03,400
Yes?

1615
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:06,900
Good!

1616
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:11,400
Tomorrow's the glorious and historic day

1617
02:23:11,600 --> 02:23:19,800
when my, sorry, our computer
will be inaugurated.

1618
02:23:20,600 --> 02:23:27,100
Yes! Ours, because nothing
was possible without you

1619
02:23:27,300 --> 02:23:32,000
For so many years, you have
shown such patience and understanding

1620
02:23:32,200 --> 02:23:34,300
and cooperated with me.

1621
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:39,400
When the computer starts tomorrow

1622
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:48,100
your utility will come to an end,
and so will your pain.

1623
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:54,400
See you tomorrow

1624
02:24:03,800 --> 02:24:05,000
Breaking news!

1625
02:24:06,500 --> 02:24:09,300
Dr. Arya has suddenly been
reminded of the poet Kabir.

1626
02:24:09,700 --> 02:24:11,100
Do today, what you must do tomorrow...

1627
02:24:11,300 --> 02:24:13,000
and do right now, what you must do today.

1628
02:24:13,200 --> 02:24:19,100
That's why, Dr. Arya has decided
to start the computer today itself.

1629
02:24:19,900 --> 02:24:23,000
and also end Rohit's life.

1630
02:24:24,200 --> 02:24:27,000
Is this where my father is kept?

1631
02:24:28,200 --> 02:24:33,400
Yes! But it's almost impossible
for a stranger to get there...

1632
02:24:33,900 --> 02:24:37,600
Dr. Arya has kept very tight security
everywhere on the island

1633
02:24:37,900 --> 02:24:41,200
So that now no one comes between
him and the computer

1634
02:24:41,500 --> 02:24:44,600
Krishna, if Dr. Arya starts the computer

1635
02:24:45,200 --> 02:24:56,100
how much havoc he can wreak and
the destruction he can cause, is unimaginable

1636
02:24:57,300 --> 02:25:06,200
mine... yours... ours, the worlds
destiny will come in his clutches.

1637
02:25:07,400 --> 02:25:10,100
That's why, Dr. Arya has to be
stopped at any cost.

1638
02:25:11,100 --> 02:25:16,000
Now you have to save not only your father
but the whole mankind, Krishna.

1639
02:25:22,100 --> 02:25:22,700
Hello.

1640
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:23,900
Krishna?

1641
02:25:25,300 --> 02:25:26,200
Grandma!

1642
02:25:26,800 --> 02:25:29,600
Krishna, are you okay?

1643
02:25:31,800 --> 02:25:32,800
Yes, Grandma

1644
02:25:33,500 --> 02:25:37,300
I don't know why I'm feeling worried.

1645
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:39,400
When are you coming back?

1646
02:25:40,100 --> 02:25:41,300
Come back soon

1647
02:25:42,800 --> 02:25:49,300
Your father's death anniversary is nearing,
you need to be here and fulfill the duties of a son.

1648
02:25:50,700 --> 02:25:55,200
I remember, Grandma. don't worry...

1649
02:25:57,500 --> 02:25:59,400
I'll fulfill all the duties of a son.

1650
02:26:29,300 --> 02:26:30,900
WELCOME TO THE FUTURE

1651
02:26:33,500 --> 02:26:34,700
Congratulations Sir!

1652
02:26:39,200 --> 02:26:43,100
See, Rohit I've won!

1653
02:26:45,500 --> 02:26:50,500
Now if you want you can end your life.

1654
02:26:54,200 --> 02:26:56,600
Or do you want me to help?

1655
02:27:00,900 --> 02:27:11,300
But what's the hurry? At least see how your
invention is going to make me God!

1656
02:28:02,100 --> 02:28:11,100
Rohit, we built this computer
so that we can see our future

1657
02:28:11,300 --> 02:28:12,800
and change it!

1658
02:28:15,200 --> 02:28:21,100
I will also change my future and show you
Today itself!

1659
02:28:29,700 --> 02:28:31,600
Dr. Arya's gone to look for the masked man

1660
02:28:33,500 --> 02:28:34,300
Masked man?

1661
02:28:55,600 --> 02:28:56,400
Kristian!

1662
02:29:02,600 --> 02:29:03,300
Krishna

1663
02:29:05,300 --> 02:29:06,600
Look Dr. Arya!

1664
02:29:07,800 --> 02:29:08,600
Come on, let's go!

1665
02:29:23,600 --> 02:29:26,700
What had Kristian done? Why kill him?

1666
02:29:28,100 --> 02:29:32,600
Dr. Arya has probably started the
computer and, he must've seen...

1667
02:29:32,800 --> 02:29:33,800
His future!

1668
02:29:35,400 --> 02:29:40,800
It will be just as Dr. Arya has seen.

1669
02:35:44,300 --> 02:35:47,400
I've changed my future!
I've changed my tomorrow!

1670
02:35:47,600 --> 02:35:49,400
There is no mask any longer...

1671
02:35:49,600 --> 02:35:55,600
Henceforth the new face of God is...
Dr. Siddhant Arya!

1672
02:36:09,500 --> 02:36:11,700
How is this possible?

1673
02:36:12,900 --> 02:36:18,000
I've killed him with my own hands.
Then... who's this?

1674
02:36:19,300 --> 02:36:23,700
Its 9:15 there and it's 9 here.

1675
02:36:24,900 --> 02:36:27,300
This means, he'll be here in
the next 15 minutes.

1676
02:36:27,900 --> 02:36:30,700
that means he is already on the island!

1677
02:36:46,900 --> 02:36:47,500
Stop!

1678
02:36:51,600 --> 02:36:57,700
To capture him we need
planning not power.

1679
02:37:48,800 --> 02:37:52,700
Dr. Arya has kept very tight security
everywhere on the island.

1680
02:38:20,400 --> 02:38:26,100
You're good! Very good.
But I'm better

1681
02:38:33,300 --> 02:38:36,200
Yes, I am better

1682
02:38:37,700 --> 02:38:40,600
Because I have seen the future.

1683
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:51,300
But due to lack of time what I
couldn't see is what I want to know...

1684
02:38:53,300 --> 02:38:55,100
Why do you want to kill me?

1685
02:38:57,400 --> 02:39:00,700
And why do you want to rescue Rohit Mehra?

1686
02:39:06,600 --> 02:39:07,700
Who are you?

1687
02:39:09,100 --> 02:39:13,100
Come to me and give me the answer.

1688
02:39:13,900 --> 02:39:14,700
come!

1689
02:39:26,700 --> 02:39:29,800
I've told you, I have seen the future

1690
02:39:30,300 --> 02:39:34,500
And I know who is with me...

1691
02:39:35,400 --> 02:39:36,200
Hello!

1692
02:39:36,900 --> 02:39:38,800
and who is against me

1693
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:42,200
So... please cooperate

1694
02:40:42,300 --> 02:40:43,400
Who are you?

1695
02:40:46,200 --> 02:40:47,900
We'll get to know right now.

1696
02:42:48,200 --> 02:42:50,900
Who... are you?

1697
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:14,600
Your son... Krishna!

1698
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:21,700
Mom.

1699
02:45:54,800 --> 02:45:55,900
Thank you, Jadoo.

1700
02:45:58,100 --> 02:45:59,000
Thank you
