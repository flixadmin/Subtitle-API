1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,520
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,320
We're onto you, Professor Strange.

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,880
Bad guys come in and monsters
come out.

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,440
I am Firefly.

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,520
Selina. Hugo Strange has Selina.

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,200
Do you remember your name?

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,040
My name is Fish Mooney.

8
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:21,040
Make me a grilled cheese sandwich.

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,720
You made me a sandwich?

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,520
- Why?
- I don't know.

11
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,880
And how exactly do you plan
on getting into Arkham?

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,480
- I'll ask for a tour.
- From the man that ordered

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,840
the assassination of your father?

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,040
He'll wanna find out what we know.

15
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,880
He won't see me and Lucius
as a threat.

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,520
I call Bullock, he comes busting in
with 100 cops.

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,600
Take them.

18
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,640
<i>Move everything you can
to the facility upstate.</i>

19
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,640
<i>You have an explosive device.
Use it.</i>

20
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,280
<i>Destroy Indian Hill.</i>

21
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,840
Basil is a chameleon of sorts.
Would you like to see?

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,160
You son of a bitch.

23
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,800
I'm Jim Gordon.

24
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,840
Right. Go get our guys.

25
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,760
No sign of Gordon.

26
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,200
<i>How long do you want us to wait?</i>

27
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,800
Give him 10 seconds.

28
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,840
If you don't see Jim,
bust that joint open and find him.

29
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,800
<i>Entry team. We go on one.</i>

30
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,640
Go. Cover me.

31
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,320
Go. Go!

32
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,400
Four, three, two...

33
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,120
Stand down.

34
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,080
- Stand down, officers.
- Hold.

35
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,240
- Hold.
- Stand down.

36
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,760
- All clear.
- Stand down. Stand down.

37
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,880
All clear?

38
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,800
Sorry to waste your time, hoss.

39
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,680
How about a ride to HQ?

40
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,360
Sure thing, Jim. You okay?

41
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,320
You look kind of hinky.

42
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,240
Never better.

43
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,760
Strange!

44
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,760
Strange! Strange!

45
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,480
Strange, you son of a bitch,
come back here!

46
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,280
So.

47
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,320
- You're really doing this.
- Not my call.

48
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,160
Prepare patients for transport
to the upstate facility.

49
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,200
If one of your patients
were to escape...

50
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,680
They won't. The police
won't be delayed much longer.

51
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,480
Prepare the patients and move fast.

52
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,560
As soon as we're done with Gordon and
Wayne, we'll detonate the bomb.

53
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,800
Yes, sir.

54
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,760
{\an5}Okay, quiz kids.

55
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,000
{\an5}Who's ready to play Life or Death?

56
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,320
{\an5}Sir. Mr. Nygma.
You are Nygma, aren't you?

57
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,000
{\an5}This is absurd. Police
know we're here. You can't kill us.

58
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,680
Are you ready to play?

59
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,840
{\an5}Yes.

60
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,640
Good.

61
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,360
{\an5}<i>You have one guess.
Five minutes to talk it over.</i>

62
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,640
{\an5}Who runs Indian Hill?

63
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,000
{\an5}<i>Who runs Indian Hill?</i>

64
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,560
{\an5}<i>You have one guess.</i>

65
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,880
Think carefully, fellas.

66
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,520
{\an5}Answer correctly...

67
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,960
{\an5}or die.

68
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,280
{\an5}Strange.

69
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,520
{\an5}Strange?

70
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,720
{\an5}Hi.

71
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,120
{\an5}What is that?

72
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,360
{\an5}Honesty serum.

73
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,600
{\an5}I need to know what you know.

74
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,480
{\an5}Wait. Wait.

75
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,760
{\an5}So how do you feel now?

76
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,600
Not good.

77
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,720
{\an5}Can you be more specific?

78
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,000
{\an5}I feel vulnerable.

79
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,160
{\an5}Naked.

80
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:19,000
{\an5}Your feelings are entirely natural
and normal.

81
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,480
There is nothing to be ashamed of.

82
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,560
You are in a helpless situation.

83
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,280
There is nothing you can do.

84
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,040
Do you understand that?

85
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,680
Yes.

86
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,640
- No.
- No?

87
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,560
What can you do?

88
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,800
James, what can you do?

89
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,760
Made a plan.

90
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,240
Tell me your plan.

91
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,920
{\an5}If I don't check-in
with the GCPD by noon

92
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,480
tell them I'm safe

93
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,600
{\an5}they will come after you.

94
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,880
Yes.

95
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,280
Yes, I know.

96
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,040
You did check in with the GCPD.

97
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,800
Nobody's coming.

98
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,960
You can relax.

99
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,440
Jim.

100
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,160
Jim.

101
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,840
Harv.

102
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,440
Strange is clean?
What the hell happened?

103
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,160
Dead end.

104
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,320
Dead end?

105
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,000
What are you talking about? Dead end?

106
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,520
He's connected.

107
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,400
So is my mechanic. Who isn't?

108
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,920
- Connected to people we can't cross.
- What people?

109
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,120
You don't wanna know.

110
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,440
Trust me.

111
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,720
You feeling all right?

112
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,280
You look like a sack of fish.

113
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,560
Little flu, maybe.

114
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,640
Keep your distance.

115
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,320
I'm getting laid this weekend,
fingers crossed.

116
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,320
<i>You have 60 seconds left.</i>

117
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,640
<i>Who runs Indian Hill?</i>

118
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,440
I say Hugo Strange.

119
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,640
Wayne Enterprises.

120
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,160
- Wayne Enterprises runs Indian Hill.
- That surmise.

121
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,200
Why would he ask that question
if the answer's obvious?

122
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,920
He wants to know what we know.

123
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,200
- What we think we know.
- Which is Wayne Enterprises.

124
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,320
Is that your answer?
Running out of time here.

125
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,400
Yes.

126
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,760
Correct!

127
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,360
<i>Wayne Enterprises runs Indian Hill.</i>

128
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,640
Bravo, Brucey.

129
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,400
You're almost safe.

130
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,160
Just one more question.

131
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,560
- You ready?
- Yes.

132
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,240
<i>You have five minutes, quiz kids.</i>

133
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,640
<i>Answer correctly or die.</i>

134
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,600
Wayne Enterprises runs Indian Hill.

135
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,600
But who runs Wayne Enterprises?

136
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,920
Move them out
in order of security grades.

137
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,760
Lowest risk first.

138
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,120
Tranq them, immobilize them,
and put them on the bus

139
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,240
and do it fast but very,
very carefully.

140
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,000
Security is our number one priority.

141
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,240
Yes, ma'am.

142
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,480
- Hey, lady.
- Busy day, busy day.

143
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,480
We'll get to you, Number 13.

144
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,800
Your mama may be Number 13

145
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,600
but I'm a human being.

146
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,960
Fish Mooney, bitch.

147
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,920
Here, you're re-animant test case
Number 13.

148
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,040
And I'm Miss Peabody.

149
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,240
And you'd best not talk
about my mama.

150
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,280
Miss Peabody.

151
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,000
I apologize.

152
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,360
I'm a bit stressed.

153
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,480
I don't like being locked up.

154
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,200
It's against my nature.

155
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,400
I understand. I do.

156
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:57,040
But you are a priceless
scientific miracle.

157
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,320
You are history.

158
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,640
Seclusion is regrettable
but inevitable.

159
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,000
Look.

160
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,520
I've been here before.

161
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,120
All you mad scientists
say the same kind of stuff.

162
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,000
I don't care.

163
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,160
Let me go.

164
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,080
Sorry, 13.

165
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,560
Let's go.

166
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,680
You're messing with the wrong woman.

167
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,760
You hear me?

168
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,880
The wrong woman.

169
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,400
Here?

170
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,200
A little too central, maybe.

171
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,920
You don't want one piece
to overpower the room.

172
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,640
Try over there.

173
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,480
You're absolutely right.

174
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,040
See? I told you she'd be useful.
Isn't that better?

175
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,160
Interior design ain't my thing.

176
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,000
<i>News on the hour with WTGC.</i>

177
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,440

178
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,960

183
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,760
<i>- that arrests are imminent.</i>
- Hugo Strange.

184
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,880
How interesting.

185
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,400
Answer quickly, please, Jim.
Without thinking.

186
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,320
Who did you love more,
your mother or father?

187
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,760
- Mother.
- Why?

188
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,080
I resented my father's strength.

189
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,680
I see. Yes.

190
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,360
- And when he died
- Yes?

191
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,640
how did you feel?

192
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,280
- Guilty.
- For a car crash?

193
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,200
Why? It was not your fault.

194
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,840
I imagined he was gone.
And then, he was.

195
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,960
You lost a child recently.

196
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,280
- Yes.
- How does that make you feel?

197
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,040
Guilty.

198
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,200
Guilt again.

199
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,360
- You blame yourself?
- It was my fault.

200
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,480
Oh, I see. I didn't know that.

201
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,840
And what happened to the mother?

202
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,040
- Lee, was it?
- She's

203
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,240
down south somewhere.

204
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,280
- Do you still love her?
- Yes.

205
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,000
- Do you want to be with her?
- Yes.

206
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,400
And why aren't you with her?

207
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,480
I've put her through enough pain.

208
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,240
Jim.

209
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,560
I need you to relax.

210
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,560
Close your eyes.

211
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,160
Imagine that I am God.

212
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,840
All-powerful.

213
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,760
I am God.

214
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,240
And I absolve you
of all of your guilt.

215
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,440
I put that guilt on you.

216
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,160
And now

217
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,880
I take it away.

218
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,760
It's gone.

219
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,120
Your burdens are gone.

220
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,280
So how do you feel?

221
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,880
Good. Better.

222
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,640
Good.

223
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,400
Good, good.

224
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,240
Jim.

225
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,680
Now that we're relaxed
and speaking honestly, tell me.

226
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,680
What do you know about our work
here at Indian Hill?

227
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,160
You're building monsters
for military use.

228
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,960
Oh, we're doing much more than that.
But for who?

229
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,400
Who owns Indian Hill?

230
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,800
Wayne Enterprises.

231
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:55,720
And who controls Wayne Enterprises
behind the scenes?

232
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,120
Who controls everything in Gotham

233
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,400
behind the scenes?

234
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,480
I don't know.

235
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,240
The rich?

236
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,560
Oh, they are rich, I'm sure.

237
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,480
But can you be more specific?

238
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,840
Who controls Gotham, Jim?

239
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,560
You never heard of a

240
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,560
secret council?

241
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,560
Secret council?

242
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,120
No.

243
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,120
Excellent.

244
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,320
Excellent. Thank you.

245
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,080
That's what I needed to know.

246
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,280
Professor Strange.

247
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,080
Yes, Jim?

248
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,440
What you said about Lee.

249
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,800
I should have gone after her?

250
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,880
Oh, no doubt.

251
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,320
Guilt has compelled you to sacrifice
your heart to your conscience.

252
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,200
But guilt is useless.

253
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,920
Love, Jim.

254
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,440
Love is our guide.

255
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,000
Time's up, I'm afraid.

256
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,320
In the spirit of intimacy
and honesty,

257
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:15,680
I have been speaking about your life
as if it had a future

258
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,080
and that is not so.

259
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,360
You have a few hours.

260
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,760
You have 30 seconds left.

261
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,200
<i>Who runs Wayne Enterprises?</i>

262
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,240
The devil, maybe? Is that the deal?
Communists? Witches?

263
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,120
No, there's truth behind
this question. A big secret.

264
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,040
I've worked for Wayne Enterprises
for 10 years.

265
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,920
There is no secret. The board
of directors runs Wayne Enterprises.

266
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,160
- Fifteen seconds.
- That can't be the answer, Lucius.

267
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,840
<i>Ten seconds.</i>

268
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,040
Give us more time!

269
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,600
- Five seconds.
- The board of directors.

270
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,360
Incorrect.

271
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,960
<i>Oh, what a shame.</i>

272
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,840
The correct answer is...

273
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,360
Sorry, fellas, you lose.

274
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,720
<i>And what happens to losers?</i>

275
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,640
Yowza!

276
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,240
<i>Death by poison gas.</i>

277
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,480
Jim.

278
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,040
Jim.

279
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,080
Hi.

280
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,640
Hi.

281
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,640
Are we alive?

282
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,760
So far so good.

283
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,200
I had to be sure.
I thought we were dead.

284
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,120
Wow, that was unpleasant.

285
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,800
How are things going for you?

286
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,480
We've had a hell of a time.

287
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,800
Same.

288
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,920
- You okay?
- A little groggy.

289
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,920
He drugged me. Made me talk.

290
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,800
About Wayne Enterprises, right?

291
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,000
About everything.

292
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,800
Bruce,

293
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,880
I never should have made that
oath to you.

294
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,200
- That's not really...
- I was arrogant and naive.

295
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,800
And I'm sorry.

296
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,400
I tried to do the right thing but

297
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,400
what a fool I've been.

298
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,760
What kind of drugs did they give you?

299
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,960
Well done, Ed.

300
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:32,680
I'm impressed. You were a
shaman of sorts. A witch doctor.

301
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,440
So just between us,
who does run Wayne Enterprises?

302
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:39,400
I could tell you. But then I would
have to lobotomize you.

303
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,880
Got you.

304
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,840
Still moving forward, sir,
I would be more than happy

305
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,240
to help you with any
of your other cases.

306
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,200
You would be a wonderful addition
to my staff, Ed.

307
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,440
A wonderful addition
if you were only sane.

308
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,840
- No, seriously.
- Yes, seriously.

309
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,280
You have been very useful.

310
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:00,440
And we arrogant physicians have much
to learn from a madman like you.

311
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,360
But not that much.

312
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,880
No, no, no. No, no, no.

313
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:07,120
You will not treat me
like a crazy person! No!

314
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,080
Madam, I bring good news.

315
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,720
Gordon and Wayne and Fox
know nothing but mundanities.

316
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,800
They have told no one the truth.

317
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,240
Because they have none of the truth.

318
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,080
Our secret is safe.

319
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,240
<i>Kill them all.</i>

320
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,040
<i>Then continue with the evacuation
of your test subjects.</i>

321
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,240
Yes, madam.

322
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,760
<i>The destruction of Indian Hill
will proceed as scheduled.</i>

323
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,400
<i>Releasing Galavan was a grave error
on your part.</i>

324
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,080
<i>No more of your patients
will see the light of day</i>

325
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,160
<i>under any circumstances.</i>

326
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,880
<i>At any cost.</i>

327
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,920
I understand, madam.

328
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,720
These people
to whom Strange is connected

329
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,400
they must be pretty heavy, huh,
to make you back off.

330
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,840
Oh, they're heavy.

331
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,480
I don't want anything dangerous,
I just like being titillated.

332
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,680
Seriously, you don't wanna know.

333
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,760
Remember the time you called me
from the hospital

334
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,680
when you had Falcone on the gurney?

335
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,360
And the whole town and their uncle
were looking to kill you both?

336
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,840
How could I forget?

337
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,000
Remember what I said to you
on the phone?

338
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,320
Remember what I said?

339
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,840
I forget.

340
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,600
That's funny.

341
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,400
Gordon, you're back. What happened?

342
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,280
Where's Master Bruce? Where's Lucius?

343
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,800
Where are they? Have you seen them?

344
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,840
- Hey, Alfred, take it easy.
- Where are they?

345
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:44,240
Alfred. Alfred, relax.

346
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,760
Master Bruce and Lucius are
headed back to Wayne Manor.

347
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,520
Yeah, well, that's a load of obtosh
for starters, isn't it?

348
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,800
I just come back from there.

349
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,800
What can I tell you?
Maybe they stopped to get a snack.

350
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,600
So, what about Strange?

351
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,840
It's complicated.

352
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,800
Well, go on, then. What?

353
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,280
Complicated police business.

354
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,000
He's got a touch of the flu.

355
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,960
You.

356
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,720
How you doing?

357
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,560
Middling.

358
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,840
What's your deal?

359
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,920
Chilling.

360
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,680
They're gonna blow this dump sky high

361
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,560
and the whole circus
is moving upstate.

362
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,040
- When?
- Soon. Like, an hour.

363
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,200
- Can you escape?
- Of course.

364
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,600
Firefly thinks I'm her sidekick.

365
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,560
- So I got trusty status.
- Then please do so.

366
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,320
- Get out and call the police...
- I'll do what I like.

367
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,520
I led you into this mess.

368
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,280
I was self-righteous and arrogant
and manipulative.

369
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,640
- I used you and I'm sorry.
- Like you can use me.

370
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,560
I got you wrapped around my pinky.

371
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,040
Always have.

372
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,840
Be that as it may.

373
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,200
If you can escape, do it.

374
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,840
Manipulative.

375
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,040
As if.

376
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,360
What did she say?

377
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,680
She'll do what she likes.

378
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,960
And there's a bomb.

379
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,920
Hello, Number 13.

380
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,000
Stay calm.

381
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,720
No one's going to hurt you.

382
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,920
It's time to go on a trip.

383
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,520
Give me your right arm.

384
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,040
Say my name.

385
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,760
Fish Mooney.

386
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,800
That's right.

387
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,440
What's your name?

388
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,480
Ethel Peabody.

389
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,720
Ethel

390
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,040
you seem sad and anxious.

391
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,600
You got that right.

392
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:46,640
You let me out of here
and I'll be your friend.

393
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,800
Oh, no, no.

394
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

395
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,440
Interesting.
Miss Peabody, what are you doing?

396
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,840
What she says.

397
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,440
Why?

398
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,440
I don't know.

399
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,960
Miss Mooney,
you have special talents.

400
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:35,440
Some form of psychotropic chemical
agent on your skin, I imagine.

401
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,040
You are marvelous.
Yes, truly marvelous.

402
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,520
- Always was.
- Indeed.

403
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,160
Would love to chat about me
but we have a bus to catch.

404
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:48,760
No. Ms. Mooney,
if you and the others on that bus

405
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,640
were to appear in public,
it would cause a revolution.

406
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,000
An apocalypse.

407
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,800
I simply can't allow you
to just walk out of here.

408
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,400
Watch me.

409
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,400
Please don't go.
Please, you're breaking my heart.

410
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,360
I love you like my own daughter.
No one could love you more.

411
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,400
But I will have to kill you
before I let you go.

412
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,160
Please choose life.

413
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,200
You would have made a great pimp.

414
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,160
No, no, no.

415
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,640
No!

416
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,560
Bring him back.

417
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:30,720
Hugo, I order you to stop. Now.

418
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,760
Stop. Now!

419
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,120
You hear me?

420
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,240
<i>Security systems activated.</i>

421
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,760
<i>Security systems activated.</i>

422
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,760
No!

423
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,840
I've tried calling about
a thousand times.

424
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,560
Still no answer.

425
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,240
Strange has them. I'm positive.

426
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,760
Holy crap. Are you still here?

427
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,080
I told you a thousand times,
Strange is clean.

428
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,240
You're in charge of that, are you?

429
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,560
Strange though, isn't it?

430
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,960
I mean, strange they're MIA.

431
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,560
That's funny.

432
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,520
- Strange.
- Funny?

433
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,160
You know, maybe I should send
the strike force back into Arkham,

434
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,440
- have a little look-see.
- No, no, you don't wanna do that,

435
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,840
bad idea.
Trust me, that's a terrible idea.

436
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,280
How long you known me?

437
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:57,720
All right. If you're good,
I guess I'm good.

438
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,520
I don't know who's got to you,
Gordon, but you're just, just...

439
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,080
Weird.

440
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,560
Hey, Alfred.

441
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,080
- Ms. Kean.
- How's the buttling business?

442
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,320
- To what do we owe the...?
- Jimmy, my love,

443
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,560
I'm sure you're ever so busy,
but could we have a word in private?

444
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,600
You bet.

445
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,280
Well, you look terrible.

446
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,680
Gee, thanks, Barbara.
You look pretty good.

447
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,320
Well, shucks.

448
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,680
Question, what the hell is going on
down at Arkham?

449
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,440
Two questions back at you, gorgeous.

450
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,880
Why you asking?
And what's in it for me?

451
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,680
I'm asking because a dear friend
of mine wants to know the answer.

452
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,640
And what would you like to be
in it for you?

453
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,760
Hey, spring is here, baby.

454
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,360
So now you like me again?

455
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,520
What's not to like?

456
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,160
- So you've forgotten about Lee?
- Lee?

457
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,640
Lee Thompkins.

458
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,480
Screw that hoe.
Water under the bridge.

459
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,640
You're not Jim.

460
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,680
Say what, now?

461
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,120
You're not Jim.

462
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,120
Hold on there, woman.

463
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,280
- Holy mother of saints.
- Holy cow.

464
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,240
Kill the captives. We have to go.

465
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,520
Whoa, whoa, where are we going?

466
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,040
- What's the hurry?
- Silence.

467
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,880
Freeze, get it done.

468
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:34,000
- Jeez, relax. What's with him?
- Quiet.

469
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,280
Quiet yourself.

470
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,160
Why do you have to kill them?

471
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,440
Why are you so mean?

472
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,320
I knew I shouldn't have spared you.

473
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,600
Freeze, kill her.

474
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,480
- Wait a minute.
- I'm sorry, Firefly.

475
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,680
I told you, she was an experiment.

476
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,960
But she's my friend. I need her.

477
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,320
We don't have time for this.

478
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,040
Please don't let him hurt me.

479
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,120
Firefly.

480
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,360
Please help me.

481
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,360
Don't you dare.

482
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,040
Out of the way, sparky.

483
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,320
- Make me.
- Firefly. No.

484
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,120
Stop!

485
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,960
What now?

486
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,520
Sounds like warfare.

487
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,960
What's going on?

488
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,640
Simple psychology.

489
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,600
Been waiting for the right moment.

490
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,160
You coming or what?

491
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,720
<i>Fifteen minutes to detonation.</i>

492
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,920
<i>Fifteen minutes to detonation.</i>

493
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,280
Strange!

494
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,320
Strange!

495
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,600
Wake up!

496
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,720
Strange!

497
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,280
Strange!

498
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,800
Alpha and Charlie squads to Arkham.

499
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,080
Bravo and Delta to Indian Hill.

500
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,200
Move!

501
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,560
Hey, Penguin.

502
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,800
So it turns out
our Mr. Strange is a very bad man.

503
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,680
The police are onto him now.

504
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,840
They figure he's planning to run
but he won't.

505
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,040
Thanks to me.

506
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,280
<i>Thank you, Barbara.</i>

507
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,120
You have pleased me.

508
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,240
Saddle up, Butch.

509
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,480
We've got an old friend to catch.

510
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,040
Wake up, Strange.

511
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,160
I know you're in there. Wake up.

512
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:28,120
Gordon. I surmise my plan
must have gone awry.

513
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,320
You could say.

514
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,400
I'm gonna stand you up now

515
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,800
and you're gonna give us a tour
of your secret lab.

516
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,680
- No.
- You don't have a choice.

517
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,440
- It's this way, right?
- We can't go there. I set a bomb.

518
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,960
The lab is going to blow up.
We have to get out of here.

519
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,800
In 10 minutes, everything within
a quarter-mile radius will be dust.

520
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,000
- That's madness.
- If you want to live,

521
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,120
which I do, frankly,
we had better leave.

522
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,160
We detected radioactive material.
You got it out first, right?

523
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,560
There wasn't enough time.

524
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,240
They forced my hand.

525
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:01,520
But I calculated the chances
of a radioactive cloud as fairly low.

526
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,400
If you're wrong,
thousands of people could die.

527
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,080
Yes, yes, yes.

528
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,640
But paying that price will be better

529
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,640
than releasing what's down there.

530
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,760
- How do we shut it down?
- The security walls are up.

531
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,640
- The lab is sealed.
- There must be some way in.

532
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,160
We have to go.

533
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,640
We have to leave, now!

534
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,760
Tell me how to get that bomb
and shut it off,

535
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,000
or I'll batter you to death
right here!

536
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,080
In which case, young man,

537
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,440
I suppose I will just have to die.

538
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,600
Wait, Nygma knows the way down there.

539
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,920
- Could use some help.
- Yep.

540
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:43,080
You two, you've got nine minutes.
Get as far away from here as you can.

541
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,640
- No.
- Go, go!

542
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,000
Lucius, this way.

543
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:54,080
Yes, of course, I know how,
but what is with all the hoo-ha?

544
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,120
- What is the rush here?
- Just do it.

545
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,240
What do I get if I do it?

546
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,080
You get to live.

547
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,520
Fair enough.

548
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,920
<i>Security systems deactivated.</i>

549
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,960
<i>Security systems deactivated.</i>

550
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,960
You any good at defusing bombs?

551
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,920
I don't know yet.

552
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,040
You?

553
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,720
<i>Two minutes to detonation.</i>

554
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,680
Oh, my.

555
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,080
Got any ideas?

556
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,480
You got a knife?

557
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,960
No.

558
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,200
<i>We're on approach to Arkham
for patient evacuation.</i>

559
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,840
<i>We need that bomb squad ASAP.</i>

560
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,600
What now?

561
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,480
You're asking me?

562
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,560
How about we just

563
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,080
pull all this stuff off,
see what happens?

564
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,960
There's no cut-off program.

565
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,800
Maybe there's no tamper-proofing
program?

566
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,920
Yeah.

567
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,480
Yeah.

568
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,760
No.

569
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,440
Water.

570
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,920
- Need water.
- Water.

571
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,920
What's going on? Hello?

572
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,320
25 seconds.

573
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,080
15 seconds.

574
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,040
Please.

575
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,200
Please.

576
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,520
I need water.

577
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:04,960
Water?

578
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,080
I need water.

579
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,320
Hello?

580
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,440
Hello?

581
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,440
Hello? Guys!

582
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,920
What's going on?

583
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:51,520
Hello?

584
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,920
Where are my people?

585
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,480
Where are my people?

586
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,560
You don't understand.
We have to find my people.

587
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,160
There will be,
there will be consequences.

588
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,040
You heroic son of a bitch.

589
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,320
A nuclear bomb, huh?

590
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,000
You'll never guess what took us
so long.

591
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,320
Problem.

592
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,720
Whatever was down there,
whoever was down there in Indian Hill

593
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,480
they're not there anymore.

594
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,600
Couple of squad cars are in pursuit
of a bus

595
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,680
that left the Indian Hill's compound.

596
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,840
That's gotta be them.

597
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,240
That bus cannot get away.

598
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,320
<i>This is Unit 12 in pursuit
of the Arkham bus</i>

599
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,240
<i>heading south along the D-line.</i>

600
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,720
<i>Granting you aid, Unit 12.</i>

601
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,240
<i>Gonna take him at the next block.
Get ready.</i>

602
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,160
<i>Don't have a lot of space here.</i>

603
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,200
<i>Civilian traffic ahead.
It's blocked in.</i>

604
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,800
Hold them at the cross street.

605
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,440
<i>Nothing. I'll check up ahead.</i>

606
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,720
<i>Car 32 to Captain Bullock,
heading east toward Pittsburg.</i>

607
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,920
Damn. Damn. What's on the bus, Jim?
Tell me what's on the bus.

608
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Monsters.

609
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,680
Come on. Monsters?

610
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:29,080
Hugo Strange would rather destroy
half the city than let them out

611
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,320
and now they're out.

612
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:35,120
Code red. Code red, all units.
Pittsburg Highway.

613
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,720
<i>All units be on the lookout for
Indian Hill bus on Pittsburg Highway.</i>

614
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,360
<i>Captain Bullock,
I've got eyes on the bus</i>

615
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,200
<i>under the south Burnside Expressway.</i>

616
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,320
<i>Well then, stop the damn thing.
Don't let it get away.</i>

617
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,440
Come to mama.

618
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,120
Professor Strange!

619
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,960
Professor Strange!

620
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,040
Come out.

621
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,880
Strange, we need to talk.

622
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:07,400
You did a very bad thing to me
and now you're going to pay.

623
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,560
Impossible.

624
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,080
Nothing

625
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,520
is impossible.

626
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,000
Holy...

627
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,400
- Let's go.
- Let's do this.

628
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,560
No.

629
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,680
This city is in deep trouble
if we don't find that bus.

630
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,840
So let's find it.

631
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,920
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

632
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,480
I want squadrons of 20
in these quadrants here.

633
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,240
I want choppers in the air.

634
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,800
And I want tac units
on all the east side bridges.

635
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,040
Bruce.

636
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,440
I have to go.

637
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:11,280
I might not see you for a while,
but I'll try to stay in touch.

638
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,080
Where are you going?

639
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,840
I have to find Lee.

640
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,800
Right move, mate.

641
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,440
Do me a favor
say goodbye to Bullock for me?

642
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,880
I don't really want
the whole Celtic farewell.

643
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,680
He's gonna have his hands full.

644
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,000
But I think he can handle it.

645
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,240
Will do.

646
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,560
Chocolates.

647
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,280
Girls like chocolates.

648
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,600
I'll keep that in mind.

649
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,080
There's a man
who's got his priorities straight.

650
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,880
The love of a good woman
and all that.

651
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,240
Well,

652
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,720
I hope you learned your lesson,
Master Bruce.

653
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:07,240
And that's the end of your adventures
with the police, eh?

654
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,760
There's a secret council, Alfred.

655
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,360
A council that runs everything
in Gotham.

656
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,760
Oh, bloody hell.

657
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,480
It's them that wanted me dead.

658
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,840
We're so close, Alfred.
We're so close to the ultimate truth.

659
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,000
Oh, bloody hell.

660
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,640
Hey, don't look at me.

661
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,720
Right.

662
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,760
Right.

663
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,360
Jim, hey!

664
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,520
Hey, where you going?

665
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Hey.

666
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,840
We got monsters to find.

667
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,360
And you'll find them. I have to go.

668
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,240
But the city is in danger.

669
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,080
You got this. I know you do.

670
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,840
And I have more important things
to do.

671
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,560
- And, Harvey.
- But... Yeah?

672
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,240
You're the boss now.

673
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,760
Maybe get a haircut?

674
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,360
That's my car.

675
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,080
That's, that's my car.

676
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,240
Hey, Jim!

677
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,360
Help.

678
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,240
Help.

679
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,920
Oh, those poor souls.

680
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,080
Hello?

681
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,240
Hello?

682
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,200
Thank you.
