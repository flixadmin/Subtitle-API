00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,765
Good morning, Sergeant.

20
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,247
Good morning, Paisa.
What have you got for us?

21
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:04,247
I've got plumbing valves,
a bunch of clean towels,

22
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,402
and extra uniforms for the guards.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,048
Let him go. He's been checked.

24
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,049
Continue. Continue, Paisa.

25
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,844
Thank you, Sergeant.

26
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,729
- Good day.
- Good day.

27
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,163
- Good day, Paisa.
- Thank you! Good day, Sergeant.

28
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,964
Escobar's prison was called La Catedral,

29
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,850
but we nicknamed <i>it</i> "Club Medellín."

30
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,047
it was the embodiment of "the big lie."

31
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,847
it was even built
to look old and shitty on the outside.

32
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,362
But inside, <i>it</i> was anything but.

33
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,966
The other inmates?
Escobar's sicarios.

34
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,805
Hand-picked killers from his hometown.

35
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,684
You're here, my friend!

36
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,411
- How you doing, Velasco?
- Good, brother. How was the trip?

37
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,488
Fine, fine.
What a long drive!

38
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,244
- Really?
- It's really hot.

39
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,691
Did you encounter any problems?

40
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,445
Nothing. Perfect. Complete success.

41
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,684
I brought everything, including
the special items requested by Pablo.

42
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,489
- What's going on, buddy?
- Blackie!

43
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,201
- I thought you forgot about us.
- Let me show you.

44
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,604
Oh, my God. All right, boys!
Get a ladder over here!

45
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,730
The sicarios weren't the only guys
<i>in</i> the prison who worked for Escobar.

46
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,410
The guards did, too.

47
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,926
- Welcome to La Catedral.
- Hello.

48
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,846
Come on down, ladies.

49
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,048
We'll take care of you.

50
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,969
By the terms of his deal,

51
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,921
no cops or military were allowed
within two miles of the prison.

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,050
As much as I fucking hated this guy,
I had to hand <i>it</i> to him...

53
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,242
he had a pretty sweet deal.

54
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,323
Come on! Hurry up!
What? Is it heavy?

55
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,683
- That looks delicious, Paisa.
- All right, lobsters.

56
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,767
Escobar hadn't
built himself a prison at all.

57
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,411
He'd built himself a fortress.

58
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,964
But no matter how you decorate it...
a cage <i>is</i> still a cage.

59
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,251
Excuse me, boss.

60
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,365
I've got a report.

61
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,171
Moncada and Galeano
are reporting that we got 10,000 kilos

62
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,561
through Mexico and the Caribbean.

63
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,722
Did they pay the war tax?

64
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,088
Yes, boss, but ever since
you settled things with the government,

65
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,481
a lot of other people
have been complaining.

66
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:05,768
My expenses in and out of the prison
must be covered by everyone.

67
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,001
Understood.

68
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,961
Moncada and Galeano said the Cali cartel
are preparing for a ceasefire.

69
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,645
Mm.

70
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,129
As am I.

71
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,682
We're going to negotiate a truce.

72
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:24,651
But first,
we're going to kill a few of his men.

73
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,285
I'm sorry, boss, but the Cali cartel
is going to take that as an act of war,

74
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,124
don't you think?

75
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,647
The purpose of war...

76
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,603
is peace.

77
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,048
If there was one benefit
to Escobar's imprisonment,

78
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,124
it's that peace
had finally come to Bogotá.

79
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,125
Connie and I took advantage
and began adoption proceedings.

80
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,521
The war had left many orphans.

81
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,202
One... we could do something about.

82
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:10,205
Oh, you like the pink ones,
don't you? Yeah, you do.

83
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,851
Oh, orchids, look!

84
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,081
What's this one? "Cattleya."

85
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,082
It means "graceful." Hm.

86
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,448
That describes me perfectly.

87
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,047
Oh, buying baby things
and plants for the apartment...

88
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,128
we're a family.

89
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,248
We're domesticated animals.

90
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,924
- You want this one?
- Yeah.

91
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,691
You want that one? Yeah.

92
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,205
How about Elizabeth?

93
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,043
After my mother?
Are you kidding?

94
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,002
What is "Elizabeth" in Spanish?
Is it "Isabel"? Isabel's nice.

95
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,522
- I've always liked "Olivia."
- Olivia's OK.

96
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,804
Fuck.

97
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,242
Shit!

98
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,807
- What's the deal?
- Steve...

99
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,411
Look what you've done to my car.

100
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,364
- Where?
- Look at this traffic jam.

101
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,761
- Look what you did to my car!
- Ah! it's nothing.

102
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,683
- How am I gonna drive this?
- It's nothing.

103
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,649
Look at the fucking traffic jam
this is causing.

104
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,562
Yeah, man!

105
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,922
And you don't even speak Spanish?
Get out of here.

106
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,923
- Don't mess with me, asshole.
- Easy, man.

107
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,688
Son of a bitch. Are you gonna hit me?
What the hell have you come here for, fag?

108
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,326
I deserve respect, you son of a bitch.
So that's it, then.

109
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,131
What, are you gonna hit me?
You and who else?

110
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,209
Oh, my...

111
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,041
OK, take it easy.
It's all right. it's OK now.

112
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,043
- Calm down, asshole.
- OK?

113
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,686
- Relax, man. OK.
- OK?

114
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,683
OK, calm down.

115
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,369
Have some tolerance.

116
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,010
Yeah, I like "Olivia."

117
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,643
- Do you hear that?
- What?

118
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,566
People. Children. Laughter.

119
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,082
Even the vendors are back out.

120
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:14,047
And all because we gave Escobar
the keys to his own prison.

121
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,282
You did the right thing.

122
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,010
You think?

123
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,162
You should be happy.

124
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,329
Finally, people can return
to their normal lives.

125
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,290
Finally... we are at peace.

126
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,444
We spoke with Pablo,
and he is willing to negotiate.

127
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,850
Ten of my men have just been killed.

128
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,646
Is that how you guys
begin negotiations?

129
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,045
Two things, Pacho.

130
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:15,930
First... Mr. Galeano and I
had nothing to do with those deaths.

131
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,369
And the second thing...
this is war, Pacho.

132
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,490
There are deaths everywhere,
and we have casualties as well.

133
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,366
We are willing
to pay three million dollars

134
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,922
to settle the dispute in Los Angeles.

135
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,765
Pablo won't accept anything
under $12 million, Pacho.

136
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,920
Twelve million is nothing to you.

137
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,049
Do you want to know something?

138
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,607
It's over.

139
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,882
What's over?

140
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,169
The Medellín cartel.

141
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,647
No, you're wrong, Pacho.

142
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,844
We export twice the amount you do.

143
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,686
You invited me here
to give me this line of bullshit?

144
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:14,726
Pablo put a war tax on the two of you
for $250,000 a month.

145
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,723
That's how he treats
his friends and associates?

146
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:21,966
Don't forget that, thanks to
Mr. Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria,

147
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:26,329
extradition was abolished.
That serves you very well, doesn't it?

148
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,966
He was the one
who got us into this mess.

149
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,887
Killing politicians and cops,
bombing street corners and airplanes.

150
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:37,084
He started this fucking war.

151
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,368
Are we going to negotiate or not?

152
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:49,368
As part of Escobar's
surrender deal, Search Bloc was disbanded,

153
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,530
and Colonel Carrillo
was transferred out of the country.

154
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,242
For the time being,
Carrillo's war was over.

155
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,164
I don't see why
they're sending you to Spain.

156
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,685
It's not like the cocaine war is over.

157
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,609
Galeano and Moncada
are fronting for Escobar.

158
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,729
My superiors say I play too rough.

159
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:13,882
At least Escobar is in jail and... you can
leave knowing you helped put him there.

160
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,011
Jail?

161
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,689
I know you gringos
aren't allowed to do flyovers, but um...

162
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,203
I got some photographs,
courtesy of the Colombian military.

163
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,643
I want you to look at 'em,
tell me if this qualifies as a jail.

164
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,125
He's got a fucking soccer field.

165
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,243
Escobar is moving more coke than ever.

166
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,527
Without the Colombian government
breathing down his neck,

167
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,001
all he's gotta worry about
is the Cali cartel.

168
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,883
Let's face it, fellas...

169
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,082
he won.

170
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,289
We're here, gentlemen!

171
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,566
- Gentlemen!
- What a bumpy ride, Paisa.

172
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,881
Where did you learn to drive?

173
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,485
We closed the deal at ten million dollars.

174
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,882
This takes care of the problem
we had in LA and ends the war.

175
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,608
Sounds like a good proposition.

176
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,967
Do you know what this means, boss?

177
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,840
We can maintain our infrastructure
and the government won't be the wiser.

178
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:33,211
That way, we can... double our exports
in less than a month, Pablo.

179
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,049
How did he behave...

180
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,088
when he offered you the money?

181
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,201
What do you mean,
"how did he behave"?

182
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,049
What was his attitude?

183
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,407
Well... he was respectful, Pablo.

184
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,329
Respectful in what way?

185
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,483
- He wants peace, just like us.
- Yes, but...

186
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,609
how did he react
when you told him our solution?

187
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,370
In a positive manner.

188
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,761
He just offered you the money,
just like that?

189
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:11,049
Well... he started
at three million dollars. Right?

190
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,129
- Mm.
- But we said no,

191
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,970
and told him
you wouldn't take less than 12.

192
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,250
So he offered ten,
and we felt that was a fair deal.

193
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,686
Offered you three million?

194
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,890
He was feeling us out.
He knew we wouldn't accept that.

195
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:33,849
If he really respected me,
he would be grateful if I accepted 20.

196
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,491
That's right, boss.
Ask for 20. In one shot.

197
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,210
Tell him I'm not happy
with less than 30.

198
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,243
The Cali cartel won't accept that, Pablo.

199
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:54,684
Thirty million...
if Cali wants peace.

200
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,450
Very good.

201
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,809
I also need to raise the war tax.

202
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,969
From now on, a million a month,

203
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,726
for both of you...
and all our other partners.

204
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,690
Good move beating him,
you son of a bitch.

205
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:02,161
If we get solid proof that Escobar
is violating the terms of his surrender,

206
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,844
then they have to send him
to a real prison,

207
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,769
but we need more
than these aerial shots.

208
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,127
Can you get us satellite communications
or wire intercepts?

209
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,806
There's a no-fly zone over the prison,
with antiaircraft guns

210
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,087
manned by the Colombian army
to enforce it.

211
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,083
You're playing with fire
if Noonan finds out.

212
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,162
We don't got shit on him
without intercepts.

213
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,242
- Don't need 'em.
- What? The hell we don't.

214
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,004
They're not using phones.

215
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,281
- The hell is that?
- I could spot a coop a mile away.

216
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,442
That's how they're sending messages.

217
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,491
To avoid our high-tech spy planes,

218
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:36,451
Pablo chose the most
low-tech form of communication.

219
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,727
Never said the guy wasn't crafty.

220
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,881
- You see anything yet?
- No, man.

221
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,842
You're blind as a bat.
Give me those.

222
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,807
Oh, one's goin'.

223
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,043
- Ten o'clock. Comin' in low.
- I got it.

224
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,967
- You got it?
- Yeah.

225
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,087
Low.

226
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,687
Ah...

227
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,884
That's a fast fucking pigeon.

228
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,611
Give me the gun.

229
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,889
- You trying to say I'm a lousy shot?
- Yes, I am saying you're a lousy shot.

230
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,291
Here.

231
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,681
You're a shit shot.

232
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,729
- Heads up, heads up.
- I got it.

233
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,723
- One o'clock.
- I got it.

234
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,840
Shoot.

235
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,607
Shoot!

236
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,084
Ever been duck huntin'?

237
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:51,283
No, I have not been duck hunting,
you... fucking hillbilly.

238
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,847
Bingo.

239
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,322
It's in Spanish. Read it.

240
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:13,728
"Delivery due
with El Paisa in the tunnel."

241
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,204
The son of a bitch
built a tunnel under the jail.

242
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,529
We talked with Pablo
and reached an agreement.

243
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,971
- Mm-hm?
- Mm-hm.

244
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,562
We agreed to...

245
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,251
- one million dollars.
- What?

246
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,120
Right.

247
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,247
What about the house in Cartagena?

248
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,129
That's not happening, right?

249
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,521
Do you want your house in Cartagena?

250
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:50,286
- Of course.
- OK... you will have it.

251
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,850
Don't you see
things are improving?

252
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,930
No, I see things
are getting more complicated.

253
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:59,569
Instead of getting better...
things are getting worse.

254
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,771
Mm-hm.

255
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,450
Pablo doesn't want peace with Cali.

256
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,564
Now, what about this war tax
he's charging you?

257
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,486
$250,000 was a lot of money.

258
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,689
- And now a million?
- Ridiculous.

259
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,845
What do you think I should do?
Call Pablo and tell him I won't pay it?

260
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,287
- Obviously not.
- Then I don't understand.

261
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:29,446
- What do you want me to do?
- It's not right, Kiko, and you know it.

262
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:36,451
Look, l... adore Pablo.
I adore him.

263
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,768
But the thing is, I don't know
what's going on with him these days.

264
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,006
I don't know.
Maybe he's depressed.

265
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:57,966
We're here in a Jacuzzi...

266
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,849
free.

267
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,082
- Do you love me?
- Oh...

268
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,682
Stop fucking around.
You make me angry.

269
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:19,128
Against orders, we did
high-altitude flyovers of the prison

270
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,567
- with our infrared cameras.
- No tunnels.

271
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:25,486
Tomography report indicates nothing.
Seismic measuring, nada.

272
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,130
Can we measure radio frequency energy?

273
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,846
Well, we could try.
Doesn't penetrate deeper than 30 feet.

274
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,969
If he's bringing shit into this tunnel, you
can bet your ass he's going out that way.

275
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,767
If there's a tunnel there,
he must have dug it to China.

276
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,288
Good luck.

277
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,770
Maybe we can...

278
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,890
We can ask the military
to do light detection and ranging.

279
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,203
We got a better chance of Noonan
authorizing a divining rod.

280
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,325
- All right, man, I'm calling it a night.
- Nah, finish up.

281
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,402
No, you can't even smoke in here.

282
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,371
No luck?

283
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:14,205
These aerials don't indicate
a single tunnel in the whole mountainside.

284
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,805
Hm.

285
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:19,043
Well, the only thing I can see
in all of them is this truck.

286
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,325
- Are you finished with that, honey?
- Yeah.

287
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,210
What happened?

288
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,690
Did it stop?

289
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,606
Good morning.

290
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,330
- What's up?
- Are you "The Paisa"?

291
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,324
- Yes.
- Nice to meet you. Javier Peña.

292
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:03,603
Do me a favor
and get out of the truck.

293
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:09,364
- What's going on?
- Don't be afraid.

294
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,848
Up against the truck.

295
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,525
Let's go.

296
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,681
Do me another favor.

297
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,290
Open it up.

298
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,241
Go on.

299
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,648
We just missed a very important delivery.

300
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:55,200
Sex toys, back issues of Hustler,
a waterbed, a legal correspondence course.

301
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,531
He's bored shitless in there.

302
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,968
Look, gringos...
you don't have the right to do this.

303
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,361
Of course we have the right.

304
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:10,447
You just press the button in the truck
and we will do the rest, OK?

305
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:15,447
If the boss finds out that I let you
put cameras in the truck, he'll kill me.

306
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,646
What did he say?

307
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,922
He says if Pablo finds out,
he'll kill him.

308
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,130
Amigo...

309
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,846
Pablo's your boss?

310
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,207
Yeah? Yeah.

311
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,527
I am your boss. Yes?

312
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,206
It's OK, it's OK!
I'll do whatever you say.

313
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,611
Yeah?

314
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,521
Are you OK, friend?

315
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,121
Good day.

316
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,570
So what is this?
What am I looking at exactly?

317
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,644
- Club Medellín.
- This was all shipped in to La Catedral.

318
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,008
We got some big-screen TVs,
nice stereo equipment.

319
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,283
That's a roulette wheel,
a little bit of liquor.

320
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:59,046
Glad to see the judges could come down
with the official from the airport.

321
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,886
Javi's pretty keen on this Jacuzzi.

322
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,087
Don't forget the jukebox
with the hookers.

323
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,328
Of course, the lobster.

324
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,162
- This is a...
- Yes, it's a roulette wheel.

325
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,323
He has a casino
right there at La Catedral.

326
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:23,245
- Where did you get these pictures?
- From the DEA.

327
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,163
Of course.

328
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,163
It's not just these pictures.

329
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,005
They also have pictures of judges,
local government people,

330
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:35,041
other narcos, prostitutes...
Even soccer players come to visit Pablo.

331
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,802
- Who else has seen these?
- No one, as far as I know.

332
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,204
That's why we have to act now.

333
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:49,285
Do you think the DEA is capable
of leaking the photos to the media?

334
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:54,127
The DEA is capable of anything.
That's why we have to do something now.

335
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,643
At one time, Escobar...
used to own all of Colombia.

336
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,731
Now he's just the owner
of his own prison.

337
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:12,043
If I had to choose
between prostitutes at La Catedral...

338
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,729
or bombings in the country...

339
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,809
I would be eternally grateful
to these women.

340
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,449
Happy birthday, Pablo!

341
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,765
- Watch your step.
- Careful with the little girl!

342
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,925
How are you? Welcome.

343
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,242
- Happy birthday.
- Hello, sweetheart.

344
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,969
They're the ones I hired?
I don't believe you.

345
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:16,204
They are really good, Blackie.
I like them.

346
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:21,411
Come on, Pablo, tell us...
what are you doing these days? Hm!

347
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,404
- How do you spend your time?
- Aside from missing his family?

348
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,971
Oh! Of course.

349
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,766
- He's writing a book.
- Mm!

350
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,842
- Mother.
- What?

351
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:35,442
Isn't it true?
You are writing a book.

352
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,529
Please, Mom.

353
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,245
Well, then, you tell them.

354
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,963
- It's a collection of magazine articles.
- Many articles.

355
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,210
- Clippings. it's a book of cartoons.
- Oh, cartoons!

356
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,965
From newspapers and magazines
all over the world.

357
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,606
And you know what?
People write him every day.

358
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,127
- It's because they love him.
- I can imagine.

359
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,329
You have to find ways
to keep your mind occupied around here.

360
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:08,048
Yes, my love. And you have Judy's husband
and Galeano to help you with the business.

361
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:11,329
Yes, on that note,
Kiko is so grateful to you

362
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,801
for all the responsibilities
you have given him.

363
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,370
Thank you very much.

364
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,204
- We were in Cartagena...
- Where?

365
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,601
- We were in Cartagena last week.
- Oh, yeah?

366
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:23,009
Oh, yes, we spent
some beautiful days there relaxing.

367
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,969
It must feel good
to be able to relax like that.

368
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,362
- How nice.
- Wonderful, Tata. You can't imagine.

369
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,091
But I'll tell you,
Cartagena is really expensive.

370
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,925
Oh, it's unaffordable.

371
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:36,442
Besides, this whole "war with Cali" thing,

372
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,603
it's tough, you know,
with the tax we have to pay.

373
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:43,969
We understand it's not easy,
but there's not much we can do.

374
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,565
It's OK.

375
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,129
Kiko complained about that?

376
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,803
He mentioned it.

377
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,000
He didn't complain, Pablo,
he didn't complain.

378
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,290
Everyone here is absolutely aware
of the huge sacrifice that you're making,

379
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,131
for God's sake.
So I think it's normal, right?

380
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,924
It's normal that
we'd give you our support.

381
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:18,562
Well, I think it's normal...
l really do.

382
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,888
Juan Pablito, go play with your dad
for a little while, OK?

383
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,804
Honey, you should
play with the kids a little bit.

384
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,810
Leave the gift here.

385
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,891
I'll look after it.

386
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:04,803
The word from Sandoval is, Gaviria isn't
gonna do shit about Escobar's violations.

387
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,127
Carrillo was right. He won.

388
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,491
What are those?

389
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,163
These are a list of, uh...
my accomplishments.

390
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,570
You shred these.

391
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,960
Apologize!

392
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:26,209
Apologize!

393
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,971
- Were you watching?
- Yes.

394
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,610
You apologize!

395
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,609
I'm sorry, boss.

396
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,529
I didn't mean it.

397
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,170
- Relax.
- Are you all right, boss?

398
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,561
Relax. That's how the game goes.

399
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,211
Go on, go on.
You guys continue.

400
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,930
Are you all right, sir?

401
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,406
Boss.

402
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,483
Excuse me, boss,
but I need to speak to you.

403
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,005
Everything OK?

404
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:07,808
- Boss, we have a problem.
- What problem?

405
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,805
You remember that Moncada and Galeano
had a large shipment

406
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,521
- that was seized in Boyacá?
- Yes.

407
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,570
- 250 kilos.
- Exactly.

408
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:21,969
Can you imagine, a farmer found
three million dollars buried in a field?

409
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,485
Do you know where that was, boss?

410
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,530
In Rionegro.

411
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:32,526
True story. And pay attention,
because <i>it</i> changes a lot of lives.

412
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:37,248
Remember how I told you that
the cartel was making so much money

413
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,163
that they had to bury it?

414
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,487
And Blackbeard had the treasure map.

415
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:45,360
Well, after we got him,
he gave a lot of <i>it</i> up...

416
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,283
but not all of it.

417
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,285
It just so happens that one day,
out <i>in</i> a field <i>in</i> Rionegro,

418
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:56,002
a farmer who worked
for Galeano and Moncada found one.

419
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,765
At first, the poor guy
thought he'd dug up a body.

420
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,203
Over the years, plenty of 'em
had been buried out <i>in</i> the fields.

421
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,845
The farmer knew right away
<i>it</i> was narco money.

422
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:09,720
He was terrified he might
get buried himself <i>if</i> he took it.

423
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,571
So he took the money
to a guy who was connected,

424
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,927
who took <i>it</i> to another guy...

425
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,210
who took <i>it</i> to Pablo's
sicario lieutenant... Velasco.

426
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,880
There's cash buried everywhere.

427
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:27,964
The guerillas, the paramilitary,
the narcos...

428
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,611
- Everybody's burying cash.
- Yes, I know.

429
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,764
But right on Moncada
and Galeano's property?

430
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,966
Don't you think that's strange, boss?

431
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,843
I think it's strange.

432
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,847
Look. All this cash...

433
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:18,084
was found... in a field.

434
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,681
That's good luck, Pablo.

435
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:26,083
Or it could be bad luck.
For you both.

436
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:35,443
It was on your property,
in Rionegro.

437
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:39,042
But Pablo,
those lands are over 300 acres,

438
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:42,283
and most of us rent out to the farmers.

439
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,486
Mm.

440
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:52,045
You told me that you had
a 250-kilo shipment seized.

441
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,565
That's true.

442
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,967
The shipment equaled that amount of cash.

443
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,401
Who told you to open your mouth?

444
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:01,843
Not true? Hm?

445
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,043
Pablo, do you think
we're stealing from you?

446
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,964
That we made up that whole story
about the seizure?

447
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,010
If you'd like,
check with the cops in Boyacá.

448
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:16,483
Right, because cops in Boyacá
are so honest, right?

449
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,644
Keep in mind that
we bought that property from Gustavo.

450
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:27,768
I even remember Gustavo saying
that you had cash stashed in every corner.

451
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:35,730
Gustavo...
would never forget where he buried cash.

452
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:41,482
Who's putting this shit
in your head, Pablo? These assholes?

453
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,961
These fuckers
would sell their own mother.

454
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,846
- We are partners and friends.
- Mm.

455
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:53,968
Maybe that cash was lost
because I raised the tax?

456
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,130
Bullshit.
I paid the tax and never complained.

457
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,521
That's a lie.

458
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:05,485
- Because you complained to your wife.
- I haven't complained.

459
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,689
You have no idea
what I talk about with Judy.

460
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,488
I understand
this is difficult for you, Pablo...

461
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,164
What is difficult for me?

462
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:16,887
Well, managing all of this.
That's why you hired us.

463
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,930
- So we can manage it and look after it.
- Mm.

464
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,486
You trust us, right?

465
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,650
I understand this makes you anxious...

466
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,644
- Do I look anxious?
- No, I didn't mean that.

467
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,411
- You said with certainty that...
- No, no, what I meant to say was...

468
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:39,765
- I think you're the one who's anxious.
- We didn't do shit, Pablo!

469
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:47,011
With that tone of yours...
you're telling me you didn't do shit?

470
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:53,128
Like I was some kind of idiot.
Is this my cash or not?!

471
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,242
No, Pablo.

472
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:58,245
Did you take it and bury it
in Rionegro or not?!

473
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,283
For sure,
these guys hid your cash, boss.

474
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,245
- It's the truth, you pair of liars.
- Of course, he...

475
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,561
- Shut up, motherfucker!
- You're petty thieves!

476
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:09,531
You shut up, motherfucker!
Don't you disrespect me!

477
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,202
Pablo, look at me, man.

478
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,361
We're family.

479
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,240
You're my daughter's godfather.

480
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,608
And also godfather to Galeano's kids.

481
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,361
What's going on?

482
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,328
We're like brothers.

483
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,929
We're partners and friends.

484
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:47,090
We've been in this
our whole lives, Pablo.

485
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:50,767
We made our first trip to Miami together.

486
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:56,722
We made so much cash together that
we don't even know what we spent it on.

487
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,802
What's the problem?

488
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,927
What's happening?

489
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,565
The two of us love you very much.

490
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,847
And we're very grateful.

491
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,245
All right.

492
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,685
Being stuck in here...

493
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,848
can make someone paranoid.

494
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,966
Paisa! Paisa!

495
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:06,727
Well, man,
these things happen, right?

496
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:11,283
We're here for whatever you need.
Trust us.

497
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,289
I'm going to make a trip to Miami.

498
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:16,364
I'll bring you a few little things
to keep you entertained, OK?

499
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,411
Don Pablo.

500
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,444
Pablo, don't do it! Pablo, no!

501
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,490
You're a dog,
you son of a bitch!

502
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:30,170
What does it feel like
to take a shit on your own empire?

503
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,926
You want us to tell you
that we stole the money?

504
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:44,162
At the end of the day, you'll believe
whatever you want, motherfucker.

505
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,530
Goodbye, Kiko.

506
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:05,321
Kill me if you're such a man,
motherfucker.

507
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,641
Kill me with your own fucking hands!

508
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:10,087
Who are you talking to, asshole?

509
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,762
Motherfucker!

510
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,406
Wait a second!

511
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,489
Be careful, man.

512
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,571
Look what the dead guy gave me.

513
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:05,367
What the fuck!
You're going to burn all the meat!

514
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,091
What is wrong with you? Can't you see
I'm doing it to cover the smell?

515
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:12,404
- Yeah, but let's not burn it all.
- What are we gonna do with all this meat?

516
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,370
- What are you going to do?
- What am I supposed to do?

517
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,169
What?

518
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:32,242
Boss, are you OK?

519
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,842
Do you need anything, boss?

520
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,804
We're grilling some meat.
Do you want some?

521
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:44,407
No. I'm not hungry.

522
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,370
Navegante.

523
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,890
Boss.

524
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:20,247
- Do you want me to wax it?
- No, relax.

525
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:23,085
This one's my favorite.
I enjoy it.

526
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:26,645
This is a beautiful car.

527
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:30,165
Anything new on Galeano and Moncada?

528
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:35,725
Looks like the rumors are true, boss.

529
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:42,089
It's a shame.

530
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,649
I warned them.

531
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,724
As the twig is bent, so grows the tree.

532
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,610
Do you still have that DEA contact?

533
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:03,287
Javier Peña? Of course.

534
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:06,330
I want you to contact him
and confirm the rumors.

535
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:10,081
They're just as interested
in screwing Escobar as we are.

536
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,967
I haven't heard from him since yesterday.

537
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:18,881
I've called everyone.
I'm so worried.

538
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,328
Pablo told me
that they left La Catedral.

539
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,402
Just relax, sweetie.

540
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,964
Your husband is fine.

541
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,401
No. No, thank you.

542
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:37,487
Maybe... they had to go
somewhere else urgently?

543
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,444
Or maybe they left
without saying anything.

544
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:41,608
The way our men usually do.

545
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:44,251
Yes, but it's a little strange,
don't you think?

546
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:48,689
Kiko was very clear that he had
a meeting with Pablo at La Catedral.

547
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:50,330
He said he would be home later.

548
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:55,009
We're trying to have another baby.
I think I told you that.

549
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:59,808
No? We're trying to have another baby,
and the time is right,

550
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:03,202
so we had a very important date to keep.

551
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:07,450
Are you sure that Pablo
told you that Kiko left La Catedral?

552
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:13,651
Are you telling me
that my husband is a liar?

553
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,207
I want my husband back.

554
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:24,324
If Pablo told Tata that they left...

555
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,727
it's because they left.

556
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:32,845
Listen...
Pablo is your kids' godfather.

557
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:35,287
He would never hurt them.

558
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,964
Let's talk about Don Pablo Escobar.

559
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,491
There are rumors that
he killed Galeano and Moncada.

560
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,290
Where, in jail?

561
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:03,691
Yeah, yeah.

562
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,649
"In jail."

563
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,764
That doesn't make any sense.
They're partners.

564
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:14,891
Maybe there is not such thing as sense
with Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria.

565
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,521
Bullshit. Where'd you get it?

566
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:23,844
The relatives of the men he killed...
are up in arms.

567
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:28,329
The poor fellows went in,
but they never got out.

568
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:34,767
I want to ask you gentlemen
a serious question now.

569
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,561
How bad do you want Escobar?

570
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:42,484
How far are you willing to go
in this matter?

571
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,722
What are you proposing?

572
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:51,002
Well, we both have access to information
that could benefit the other.

573
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,850
No.

574
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:55,085
No, we don't trade information.

575
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:57,083
- Just hold on a second.
- No.

576
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:59,242
He's an informant, Javi.

577
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:02,290
Whatever you got cookin', it stinks.
I don't want it.

578
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:05,483
Appreciate the tip. Let's go.

579
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,810
Your partner here...

580
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,721
may need some convincing now.

581
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:27,049
Moncada and Galeano going
into La Catedral, last stamped 9:20.

582
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:32,131
Every return from this day forward...

583
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,928
no Moncada, no Galeano.

584
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:48,244
Personally, we couldn't have cared
less about a couple of dead narcos.

585
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:51,882
It meant more chaos and confusion
<i>in</i> the Medellín cartel.

586
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:56,606
But we wanted Escobar out of that
piece of shit excuse for a jail,

587
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:59,650
<i>in</i> a real prison, not a fortress...

588
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:02,166
where his enemies could get payback.

589
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,970
You sure?

590
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:08,931
We can either play politics
or we can do the job.

591
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:13,363
Well, we were never any good
at playing politics anyway.

592
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,810
What do you think?

593
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:25,490
These photos are worth looking into.

594
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:28,290
And believe me, I'm going to.

595
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:38,321
If it's true, this is
gonna cause a shit storm, you know?

596
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:48,248
- Be right back.
- Gracias.

597
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:52,881
Well...

598
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,883
Fuck President Gaviria.

599
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:56,809
Fuck Noonan.

600
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,048
Fuck La Catedral.

601
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,928
And fuck Pablo.

602
00:50:02,952 --> 00:50:04,952
