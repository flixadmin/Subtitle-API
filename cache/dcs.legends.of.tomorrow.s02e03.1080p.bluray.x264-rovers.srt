1
00:00:02,085 --> 00:00:03,382
DR. HEYWOOD: <i>Time travel is real,</i>

2
00:00:03,587 --> 00:00:07,433
<i>and all of history is vulnerable
to the attack of rogue time travelers.</i>

3
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:10,140
<i>But one group travels throughout time
to stop the spread of</i>

4
00:00:10,302 --> 00:00:13,727
<i>these so-called time Aberrations
and erase their damage to history.</i>

5
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:15,766
<i>A group of outcasts and misfits,</i>

6
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:18,652
<i>these individuals aren't heroes,
they're something else.</i>

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:19,811
<i>They're legends.</i>

8
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,822
SARA: <i>Previously,
on</i> Legends of Tomorrow...

9
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:24,278
Heywood. Dr. Nate Heywood.

10
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:27,820
I'm a historian, I specialize
in deductive historical reconstruction.

11
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:30,455
In layman's terms, I'm a time detective.

12
00:00:30,614 --> 00:00:31,957
Ingestible translator.

13
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:34,709
You'll be able to speak and understand
any language spoken to you.

14
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:37,121
You know how fragile we historians can be.

15
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:38,539
I know my cuts and bruises.

16
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,707
You're a hemophiliac.
You can bleed to death.

17
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,626
So your superpower is wearing the suit?

18
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:45,922
Without that fancy suit, you're nothing
but a self-righteous rich guy.

19
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:50,767
GIDEON:
<i>Mr. Heywood's vitals are dropping.</i>

20
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:53,145
I think I can save him.
I did a little tinkering to the formula.

21
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:55,097
Hello, Rex.

22
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:59,067
- Rex?
- Time traveler.

23
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:00,603
Rex!

24
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:11,871
So, how's our patient?

25
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,077
Still stable.

26
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,288
<i>Gideon has him under sedation.</i>

27
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:19,588
Any side-effects from the Nazi
super-serum you injected him with?

28
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,339
No, but that may have
a little something to do

29
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:24,001
with the work I did altering the serum
to remove the Nazi parts.

30
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:27,592
Yes, it would be a tad inconvenient
to have a monster roaming the ship.

31
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,143
Gideon, can you pilot for a little bit?

32
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:39,024
I need a break.

33
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:10,134
Where are all the knives?

34
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:15,386
Oh! Oh, there's one.

35
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:18,021
Look, if this is about
me taking all the mayonnaise,

36
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,898
you might be slightly overreacting.

37
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:21,684
You killed him.

38
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,189
"Killed him"?

39
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:25,229
I've killed lots of people.

40
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:28,023
You're gonna have to be
a bit more specific.

41
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:57,769
Huh.

42
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,478
What the hell happened to you?

43
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:06,816
I really don't know.

44
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:17,660
DR. HEYWOOD:
<i>You injected me with Nazi serum?</i>

45
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:20,417
Which I redesigned
to quintuple my own strength

46
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:23,499
and transform my skin into an alloy
100 times stronger than steel.

47
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:24,959
RORY: <i>Steel.</i>

48
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:26,665
- That's a cool name.
- DR. HEYWOOD: <i>Yeah.</i>

49
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,294
Especially since my grandfather
was called Commander Steel.

50
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,962
But what does that make me?

51
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:34,598
Corporal Steel? Mr. Steel? Citizen Steel?

52
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:35,848
JAX: <i>Who cares?</i>

53
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:37,304
You've got superpowers now, dude.

54
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:40,346
Except I don't know how
I turned to steel in the first place.

55
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:41,764
Ray'll teach you.

56
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,807
- He will?
- SARA: <i>You said it yourself.</i>

57
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:45,976
You redesigned the serum.

58
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:49,814
Which I did beautifully, but it's not like
I have some sort of instruction manual.

59
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,323
Guess you'll have to wing it.

60
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:54,485
I'm gonna go have a chat
with our stowaway.

61
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:57,655
This is gonna be so much fun.

62
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,030
Hmm.

63
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:10,634
You stowed away
before we time-jumped from 1942.

64
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:11,964
I'm going to get out of here.

65
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:14,300
And I'm going to finish what I started.

66
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:16,932
You mean killing Mick?

67
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,344
Not that I haven't thought of it myself,
but why?

68
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:22,600
He killed Rex.

69
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:23,855
What?

70
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:27,935
Rex Tyler? As in Hourman?

71
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,438
His killer stole the Askaran Amulet.

72
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,864
Look, I'm sorry. I am.

73
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:37,528
But Mick didn't do it.

74
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:41,115
He is a thief and a murderer.

75
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,999
He's also a Legend.

76
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:47,212
And Mick hasn't been off the ship
since we dropped your team off at the JSA.

77
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:51,125
With his last words,
he told me his killer was a time traveler.

78
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:56,346
You know, we've been tracking someone
who's been trying to alter history.

79
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:59,179
We think it's the same person
that gave Krieger the super-serum.

80
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:01,014
This might be your time traveler.

81
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:06,523
Look, if I let you out of here,
you promise not to hurt Mick

82
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,024
unless he really deserves it?

83
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:18,239
I'm sorry for knocking you out.

84
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,369
Sorry for locking you up.

85
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:21,906
Call it even?

86
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,586
When I was a kid, I used to play
JSA versus Nazis with my dolls.

87
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,166
Well, they were action figures, really.

88
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,081
But it doesn't matter
'cause I got superpowers now

89
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:32,500
and it's awesome.

90
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,840
Your powers manifested as a result
of a heightened adrenal response.

91
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,926
Basically, Amaya threatened you,
and you reacted.

92
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:42,093
So now, what we need to do
is duplicate the conditions

93
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:45,103
which caused you to, you know, steel on?

94
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:46,935
Wait, so you want to threaten me?

95
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:48,098
Not exactly.

96
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:49,357
Wait, let's discuss this.

97
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:52,568
I thought this was a time machine.

98
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:55,196
You saved the Justice Society.
Why can't you save Rex?

99
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,608
Because we're dealing
with another time traveler.

100
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:58,900
If we go back and save Rex,

101
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,490
the time traveler will just go back
before then and kill Rex again.

102
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:04,497
So instead of chasing our own tails,
we need to identify who we're up against.

103
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:05,873
I don't understand any of this.

104
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,160
Look, I just need you to trust us.

105
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:10,124
We're going to find who did this.
I promise you.

106
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:12,289
In the meantime, Gideon will fly you home.

107
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:16,380
I'm not going back
until Rex's killer is brought to justice.

108
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,511
We don't know how long that will take.

109
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,262
<i>Don't worry.</i>

110
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:22,470
We're professionals.
We know what we're doing.

111
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,603
DR. HEYWOOD: <i>Yeah! Come on!</i>

112
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,528
If Grandpa Heywood could see me now!

113
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:38,065
- "Professional"?
- Ish.

114
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,368
I know you're not going to take that, Ray.

115
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:43,904
Go crush this Tin Man.

116
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:48,324
Nice try.

117
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:49,492
Come on.

118
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:55,044
Hold on, I'll close it!

119
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,225
Nate!

120
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:09,062
Ray, get inside.
We have to close the door!

121
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,813
No. I gotta go after him!

122
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:13,016
Gideon, shut the cargo door!

123
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,204
What's happening to the ship?

124
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:27,455
Jax, what's our status?

125
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:31,084
<i>I'm rerouting power
from the secondary manifolds.</i>

126
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:33,085
Where are Dr. Palmer and Dr. Heywood?

127
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:35,292
- Did you check out the window?
- What?

128
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:39,043
How is it you people
haven't managed to kill yourselves yet?

129
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:40,210
Day is still young.

130
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:42,050
Jax?

131
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,255
Yeah, I'm working on it.

132
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,600
Gideon, I need you to track down Ray
and Nate and take us to their position.

133
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:56,644
GIDEON: <i>The explosive decompression
caused us to lose corrective altitude</i>

134
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,029
<i>which put too much strain
on the station-keeping thrusters.</i>

135
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,155
For God's sake, say it how it is.

136
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,406
We're screwed.

137
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,112
GIDEON: <i>We're screwed.</i>

138
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:34,765
Edo period.

139
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:39,645
Mid-17th century Japan.

140
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:44,403
That's cool.

141
00:08:58,288 --> 00:08:59,710
I'm still alive.

142
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,718
So far so good.

143
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:11,594
Oh, samurais.

144
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:18,062
Oh, right. I almost forgot.

145
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,241
Can you understand me now?

146
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:29,619
I'm looking for a friend of mine, okay?

147
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:30,950
He fell from the sky.

148
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,365
He's about yea tall.

149
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,079
<i>Made out of metal.</i>

150
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,367
No?

151
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:47,796
You're alive.

152
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:52,801
Um... Hi. How did I get here?

153
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:55,641
I found you lying
at the bottom of a crater

154
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:58,182
like you had been dropped from the sky.

155
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,396
"Dropped from the sky"?

156
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,482
That's the craziest thing I ever heard.

157
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:08,866
I sailed here, you know, across the ocean.

158
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,111
<i>With some friends.</i>

159
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,905
Who, hopefully, know where to find me.

160
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:19,373
By the looks of it, I'm gonna say
we're on the island of Honshu,

161
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:21,914
in the vicinity of Kyoto?

162
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,172
Yes.

163
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:26,467
How did you learn to speak my language?

164
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,549
I studied it for many years.

165
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:33,095
You know, so I could trade
with your countrymen.

166
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,429
Yup, feudal Japan is my jam.

167
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:42,525
MAN: <i>Masako!</i>

168
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:46,564
What are you doing talking to this <i>gaijin?</i>

169
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,573
He was hurt, Father.

170
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,699
I brought him home
so you could care for him.

171
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:52,076
And who will care for us

172
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:55,956
when the Shogun finds out
we're aiding a foreigner?

173
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:59,209
Please, Father.
You know what they would do to him.

174
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,080
Very well.

175
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:06,420
Get him inside quickly.

176
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:12,839
My name is Nate, by the way.

177
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,058
My name is Masako.

178
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:16,600
Masako.

179
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,682
That's a pretty name.

180
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:32,905
The Shogun asked you a question.

181
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,161
Where did you find your armor?

182
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:37,204
I made it.

183
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,838
Your armor is mine now.

184
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:52,929
You don't understand.

185
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,556
I designed the suit
specifically for my body.

186
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,263
Take the armor away.

187
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:02,389
You're making a big mistake!

188
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,766
It can kill you.

189
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,145
Too hot?

190
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:13,617
Are you sure your old man is cool
with you giving me a bath?

191
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,278
My father is not home.

192
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:22,996
I am only giving you a bath
because you are dirty and injured.

193
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:26,538
About that.
I'm more durable than it looks.

194
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,087
You still have not told me
where you are from.

195
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,672
The United States.

196
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:37,007
Which you've never heard of because
it doesn't exist for another 200 years.

197
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,179
You are a strange man.

198
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:41,561
You have no idea.

199
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:43,680
Enough about me.

200
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:46,850
I overheard your father
talk about the Shogun.

201
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:49,860
Is that Tokugawa Iemitsu, by any chance?

202
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:54,525
Historians view him
as a particularly brutal warlord in...

203
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:01,706
Did I say something?

204
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,545
Tomorrow, I am to be married
to Tokugawa Iemitsu.

205
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:09,873
Then my life is over.

206
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,973
How can you bring a thug
on a rescue mission?

207
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:21,218
I've known men like you.

208
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:22,761
Men who take and prey on the weak.

209
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:27,057
Listen, girly, I'm risking my neck
for two morons who fell out of the ship.

210
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,726
Why? Because they'd do the same for me.

211
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,109
Why are you on the ship?

212
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:33,738
'Cause I'm a member
of the Justice Society of America.

213
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,115
- It's my job to protect everyone.
- RORY: <i>Except for me.</i>

214
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,573
Snuck up behind me
and sliced my throat like a ninja.

215
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,238
There's no such thing as ninjas,
you idiot.

216
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:43,247
- Tell that to Chuck Norris.
- Who's that?

217
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:45,454
- And I'm the idiot.
- By the way, I'm not your girly.

218
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:47,414
All right, if you two
don't quit your squabbling,

219
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:52,253
I am going to maroon you
in a time period of my choosing, together.

220
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,006
Ah.

221
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:05,937
Not to brag, but between the
docking stabilizers and the blast doors,

222
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,768
I think this might be
my best patch work ever.

223
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:11,025
Well, charming as your confidence is,
I think we better consult the expert.

224
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:14,779
Gideon, would you be so kind
as to run a diagnostic report?

225
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,944
GIDEON: <i>Mr. Jackson's work
has done the trick.</i>

226
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,950
<i>A scan has revealed that
all 36 compartments of the ship</i>

227
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,611
<i>are in optimal condition.</i>

228
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:22,945
That's weird.

229
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,784
Actually, I think it's astonishing,
given the considerable abuse...

230
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,459
No, no. Not that.

231
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:32,463
Gideon, did you say 36 compartments?

232
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,798
<i>Correct. The entirety of the ship.</i>

233
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,177
Before Rip, you know, disappeared,

234
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:40,968
he made me learn
every inch of the Waverider,

235
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:42,845
and of those inches,

236
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,009
35 compartments.

237
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:46,849
So, either I miscalculated or...

238
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:51,024
Captain Hunter had a secret compartment
he failed to tell you about.

239
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:54,144
Gideon, please pull up
the schematics of the ship.

240
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,563
No, we still have to fix the time drive.

241
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,072
And we will.

242
00:14:58,606 --> 00:14:59,607
After.

243
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:04,320
Please don't tell me you're not intrigued.

244
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:07,832
HEAD SAMURAI:
<i>Masako-san, a word please.</i>

245
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,158
What's wrong?

246
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:11,665
The Shogun's men are here.

247
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,667
HEAD SAMURAI: <i>Please come outside.</i>

248
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,686
<i>Konnichiwa.</i> How can I help you?

249
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,180
We found a <i>gaijin</i> in the forest.

250
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:33,316
The Shogun wants to make sure

251
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:36,227
there are not any other foreigners around
to bother you.

252
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:39,193
Oh, that is very kind of him.

253
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,483
But you are the only visitor
we've had today.

254
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:42,824
Good.

255
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:47,531
The last thing the Shogun wants
before his wedding is surprises.

256
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:49,040
DR. HEYWOOD: <i>Too late.</i>

257
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:53,878
- What are you doing?
- Relax. I got this.

258
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:56,414
- Who are you?
- I'm the guy telling you

259
00:15:56,664 --> 00:16:00,885
that your Shogun's wedding's been canceled
on account that he's an asshat.

260
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:06,428
But seriously.

261
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:10,057
Why don't you boys mosey on back
to your big, bad boss

262
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,220
and tell him the news?

263
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,680
Or what?

264
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:15,892
Or it's gonna get ugly.

265
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:19,904
I am wearing a Samurai's armor.
You are not.

266
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:22,236
I wear my armor on the inside.

267
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:25,861
Nate, stop insulting him. I beg of you.

268
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,908
Relax. I got this.

269
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,787
He caught me off guard.

270
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,798
He caught me off guard.
Caught me off guard.

271
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:45,259
Come at me now.

272
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:47,431
It's not turning on.

273
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:50,886
Stop! Stop, please.
You're going to kill him.

274
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:53,555
That is entirely up to him.

275
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:55,936
Stay down, <i>gaijin.</i>

276
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:57,934
She doesn't want to marry him.

277
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,612
We will return tomorrow
to take you to the castle.

278
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:14,785
I trust there will be
no more surprises. <i>Ikuzo.</i>

279
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:33,641
The sword did not cut any vital organs,
but the blood loss...

280
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,396
Oh, tell me about it.

281
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:37,394
What were you thinking?

282
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,313
I didn't mean to cause you
any more trouble.

283
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:41,645
I was just trying to help.

284
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,488
No one can help me.

285
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,155
- We have that in common.
- Nate.

286
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:49,819
Nate!

287
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:53,614
SARA: The signal from Ray's Atom suit
is getting stronger.

288
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,041
Doesn't exactly look inviting, does it?

289
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,787
RORY: It's like <i>Ninja Ill: The Domination.</i>

290
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:00,500
Never took you for a cinephile.

291
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:03,382
All I know is ninjas
like to hide in trees.

292
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,043
I don't see anything.

293
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:06,673
Exactly.

294
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,717
You don't find them, they find you.

295
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:12,675
Just because you saw ninjas in a movie,
that doesn't make them real.

296
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:15,721
I have to side with Mick on this one,
they're real.

297
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,684
You think there's
a secret brotherhood of men,

298
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:19,190
trained in the art of assassination?

299
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:23,194
I hate to break it to you, Amaya,
but I'm basically a ninja.

300
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,030
Mmm.

301
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:28,945
I miss the JSA.

302
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:32,654
Compartment 36 should be right about here.

303
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:36,700
- What are you doing, Grey?
- I'm looking for any hidden doors.

304
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:38,664
Oh, we don't have time for this.

305
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:40,836
Nate and Ray are lost in feudal Japan.

306
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:42,838
Let's just fix the ship and go.

307
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,377
Did you hear that, Jefferson?

308
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:49,170
Move.

309
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:01,315
- Oh, my God.
- A secret hatch.

310
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:02,983
PROFESSOR STEIN: <i>With a sequencing lock.</i>

311
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:06,104
Clearly, Captain Hunter
didn't want anyone getting in.

312
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:09,149
Or maybe he was trying
to keep something from getting out.

313
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:14,245
If I learned one thing from <i>Lost,</i>
it's you don't go opening secret hatches.

314
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:20,334
SARA: <i>Ray's close. Look sharp.</i>

315
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:27,796
Haircut, let's get out of here.

316
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:30,044
We're saving your ass, again.

317
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:34,557
It is you who need a rescuing.

318
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:41,146
RAY: <i>Fellas?</i>

319
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:43,683
Getting a little cold in here
without my suit.

320
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:56,495
You are already defeated
before you have even begun.

321
00:19:57,405 --> 00:20:00,500
I have been trained in the art of war
by Shimura himself.

322
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:03,916
League of Assassins. Class of '09.

323
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,710
Don't take it easy on me.

324
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:36,777
Hiya!

325
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:41,991
We got to go.

326
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:50,508
- Oh, hey, guys.
- Wrong way, Haircut.

327
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,460
What about my suit?

328
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:57,765
We can get it later.

329
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,551
Hiya!

330
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:14,024
My friend's serum,
it's cured my hemophilia.

331
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:18,281
Uh, long story, um...

332
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:22,039
Short version, my blood didn't clot
like normal people.

333
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:28,584
So if I were to cut myself shaving
or get a paper cut, I could die.

334
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:32,208
So every day, you were afraid to live.

335
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,376
Pretty much.

336
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:42,476
In the Samurai tradition,
a warrior is always prepared for death.

337
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,726
A woman celebrates
when her husband dies with honor.

338
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:48,891
Wow.

339
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:51,061
That's hardcore.

340
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,400
A Samurai who fights without armor,

341
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,237
that is hardcore.

342
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,157
RAY: <i>Nate! You're alive.</i>

343
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:08,207
- DR. HEYWOOD: <i>Hey, guys. You found me.</i>
- Bad timing?

344
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:09,913
No, no.

345
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:15,426
Masako, these are my friends
I was telling you about.

346
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:18,838
Can I get you something to drink?

347
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:20,556
Sake. Lots of it.

348
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,850
What he meant to say is,
thanks for your hospitality,

349
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:25,015
- but we must be going.
- No, I didn't.

350
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,100
Amaya is right. Nate, let's go.

351
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:28,476
I can't.

352
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:31,938
We can't leave.

353
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:35,738
Masako is supposed to marry
the Shogun, Tokugawa Iemitsu.

354
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:37,281
Yeah, met him. Not a fan.

355
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,487
Well, the reason he sticks out
in the history books

356
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:41,114
is because he likes to murder his wives.

357
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,033
<i>And I can't leave Masako to his mercy.</i>

358
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:45,077
Especially since he stole my Atom suit.

359
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:46,533
Exactly. Wait, what?

360
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,497
You let the Shogun steal
a 21st century super-suit?

361
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,129
After I crash landed trying to rescue you.

362
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:55,003
How does the Shogun even know
how to operate your Atom suit?

363
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:59,045
- I designed it so an idiot could use it.
- And an idiot does.

364
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:02,260
Guys, bottom line is,
if the Shogun has the Atom suit,

365
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,466
it's not just Masako and the village
we have to protect.

366
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,601
He can use it to conquer the whole region.

367
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,138
You said the Shogun's coming
for your new girlfriend?

368
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:12,350
Easier to defend a village
than to attack a castle.

369
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:14,939
But anyone who tries to fight the Shogun
will be cut down.

370
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:19,107
Except if that person is made of steel.

371
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:23,703
About that. I'm having
a little problem accessing my powers.

372
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:26,114
Sounds like you're having
performance issues.

373
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,374
And it looks like
you're not done training him, yet.

374
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:32,287
Now, the rest of us need to figure out
how we can defend a village.

375
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:35,627
Not me.
Wake me up when the action starts.

376
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,512
- Whoa.
- What is this place?

377
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:53,933
It appears to be
some sort of armory.

378
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:56,736
JAX: <i>There's a reason why
Rip didn't want us in here.</i>

379
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:58,987
Some things you can't un-see.

380
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:01,069
But why the big secret?

381
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:04,030
Rip didn't trust us to know that
there were heavy-duty weapons on board?

382
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:05,694
What, would you?

383
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:11,534
- What the...
- Look, Jefferson.

384
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:17,669
Our old friend has hailed the <i>Waverider.</i>

385
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,293
Let's play it.

386
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:24,175
BARRY: <i>Sorry to contact you like this,
Captain Hunter.</i>

387
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:26,514
<i>But I can't risk putting
any more lives in danger.</i>

388
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:29,974
- I thought this is from Barry Allen.
- It is. Only from 40 years in the future.

389
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,637
- <i>And neither can you.</i>
- Fascinating.

390
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:34,891
<i>Which is why you'll keep
what I'm about to tell you a secret.</i>

391
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,025
<i>Even from the rest of your team.</i>

392
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:42,774
The Atom suit is made of
and powered by dwarf star alloy.

393
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,660
It's strong enough to withstand
bullets, arrows and explosives.

394
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:48,995
- So it's impenetrable?
- Not quite.

395
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:52,450
Underneath the left thruster
is the alpha-stabilizer.

396
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:54,334
Alpha-stabilizer. Got it.

397
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:55,585
If you destroy it,

398
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:58,998
the photons that stream from the suit's
weapon systems will overheat,

399
00:24:59,957 --> 00:25:02,085
theoretically causing somatic overload.

400
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:04,629
Theoretically? That's comforting.

401
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:06,718
You have to get close to the Shogun.

402
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,632
In order to do that,
you'll have to be able to harden.

403
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,018
Well, when you're putting it
in those terms, it isn't helping.

404
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:14,771
- Ow! Neither is that.
- It worked the last time.

405
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,641
Ow! Ow!

406
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:19,318
Come on. My serum is flawless.

407
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:22,400
- Your lack of focus is the problem.
- You think I'm not focusing?

408
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,404
- Enough! I can't do it.
- Yes, you can.

409
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:28,786
You don't think I want to save the girl,
spare the village,

410
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,742
and be a hero for once in my damn life?

411
00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:33,540
I spent half of my childhood
in the hospital,

412
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:36,794
where it didn't even occur to me
to dream about having superpowers.

413
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:39,630
But guess what? I got them, I lost them.

414
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:42,007
Now I really, really need them,
and I can't get them back.

415
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:43,463
This isn't all about you.

416
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:46,845
I worked for years,
spent billions of dollars,

417
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:48,472
to develop the Atom suit.

418
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,428
I nearly died learning to shrink.

419
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:54,637
And now, I have to teach you
to destroy the very thing,

420
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:57,056
the only thing, that makes me a hero.

421
00:25:58,474 --> 00:25:59,600
Wait.

422
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:02,820
Somatic overload means destroy the suit?

423
00:26:03,437 --> 00:26:04,814
Yeah, Nate.

424
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:09,447
We can't beat the Shogun
while he's wearing the suit.

425
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:10,987
So, we have to blow the suit up.

426
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:15,161
Your powers are within you.

427
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:19,169
After today, I'll have nothing left.

428
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:22,748
Ray.

429
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:37,180
You should all be safe here.

430
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:46,154
They've never seen foreigners before.

431
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:48,114
I was once just like them.

432
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:50,571
My village was also small and isolated.

433
00:26:51,485 --> 00:26:53,908
Some would say that
my people were superstitious,

434
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:56,707
but in truth, we were protected.

435
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:58,955
Protected by that?

436
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:04,548
Legend has it that this totem was
one of five created by the gods,

437
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:07,506
and given to the five great tribes
of Zambesi.

438
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:13,136
This totem harnesses the <i>ashe</i>
or the life force of the animal kingdom.

439
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:17,603
It was passed down to me from my mother
and from hers before that.

440
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:20,185
And why did you leave?

441
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:22,391
I was recruited by the JSA.

442
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:27,363
And I realized that the world was
much larger than just my village

443
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:31,317
and that there are people beyond
its borders who also needed protection.

444
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:36,868
Sometimes I can't help but worry
that with me gone,

445
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:39,825
there's no one left to guard my home,

446
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:43,500
from people like Mr. Rory.

447
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,919
At the end of the day,
Mick does the right thing.

448
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,334
Usually.

449
00:27:58,427 --> 00:28:01,180
You remind me of my son.

450
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:05,101
Why? Was he a terrible teacher, too?

451
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:11,449
He was a great Samurai.

452
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:19,908
I built him the strongest
and most formidable armor in all of Japan.

453
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:24,795
Forged him a sword fit for an emperor.

454
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:27,957
What happened to him?

455
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:33,133
My son was popular

456
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:35,969
with the men who served under him,

457
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:38,384
and the Shogun resented him for it.

458
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:43,598
So he ordered Oda to commit <i>seppuku.</i>

459
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:48,103
We will make sure that the Shogun
pays for what he's done to your family.

460
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:50,316
Maybe.

461
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:52,322
Maybe not.

462
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:59,322
But I ask you, would I rather
hold my son again or his armor?

463
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:02,658
Your son, obviously.

464
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:07,087
An armor is nothing
but iron, leather and silk.

465
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:08,664
It can be replaced.

466
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:14,011
But the man who wears the armor is...

467
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,013
I get it.

468
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:19,179
You're saying I don't need
a suit of armor to defeat the Shogun.

469
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:20,846
Don't be ridiculous.

470
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,846
He'll kill you in seconds.

471
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,602
Follow me.

472
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:32,354
- I'm going to die.
- Yeah, probably.

473
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:36,363
That was actually your cue to cheer me up.

474
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:39,699
If you accept death,
you have nothing to fear.

475
00:29:41,363 --> 00:29:44,116
I'm more afraid of what's
going to happen to you if I die.

476
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:50,710
I know I have these powers inside me.
I just can't figure out how to use them.

477
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,299
Does a child learn to laugh?

478
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,506
Does he sit and practice laughing?

479
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:58,513
No, he just laughs.

480
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:00,340
Hmm.

481
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,143
"Do or do not, there is no try."

482
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:05,178
Exactly.

483
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:06,851
Where did you learn that?

484
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:09,350
From...

485
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:12,565
A great <i>sensei</i> from where I'm from.

486
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:14,688
Yoda.

487
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:18,401
This Master Yoda is very wise.

488
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,491
- The Shogun approaches.
- Get to the temple.

489
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,323
Where is my bride?

490
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:00,071
She's not leaving.

491
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:01,864
Not with you.

492
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:12,045
I'm just going to need a second.

493
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:34,351
Find the villagers. Kill them.

494
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:42,784
RAY: <i>Your form is all wrong.</i>

495
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:55,126
I ordered Ichiro to destroy that blade
after the death of his son.

496
00:31:56,790 --> 00:32:00,715
Very well. I will destroy it myself.

497
00:32:06,216 --> 00:32:08,514
<i>Konnichiwa,</i> scumbag.

498
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:13,182
Go get him.

499
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:20,113
I will kill you with your own armor.

500
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:24,826
Check the temple.

501
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:27,071
Rematch?

502
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:31,579
Who is your master?

503
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,035
I have no master.

504
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,954
A ronin. You're not worthy of the effort.

505
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:01,442
You have fought with honor.

506
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:04,199
Now, you will die with it.

507
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:06,906
About that...

508
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:17,496
This village is under our protection.

509
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:20,131
Leave now, and we'll spare your lives.

510
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:44,611
A sword is only as deadly
as the man who wields it.

511
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:56,789
And armor is only as strong
as the man who wears it.

512
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:22,318
I don't want to shoot you guys.
I love ninjas.

513
00:34:48,128 --> 00:34:50,802
That was the armature relay.
Enhances the limbs' reaction time.

514
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:10,985
Where the hell is Mick?

515
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:13,119
Probably ransacking the village himself.

516
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:24,046
Told you ninjas were real.

517
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:29,336
That's the cooling system.
Trust me, it gets hot in there, I know.

518
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:31,300
You think you are clever.

519
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:46,103
You dishonor my family
and threaten my village.

520
00:35:46,353 --> 00:35:47,980
I will enjoy killing you.

521
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:58,157
Your family will be extinguished
from history.

522
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:07,215
We haven't been introduced. Name's Steel.

523
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,073
- Remember, you've got to hit him...
- I remember.

524
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:44,999
Do it!

525
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,937
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

526
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:09,523
- You did it.
- I did it.

527
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,063
Yep.

528
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,486
You blew up the Atom suit.

529
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:23,416
I am so sorry.

530
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:25,661
It's okay.

531
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:29,748
You steeled on. I'm kinda proud of you.

532
00:37:42,844 --> 00:37:45,017
Master Yoda taught you well.

533
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:49,977
Right. Yoda.
Well, thank you. Um...

534
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:55,482
I was thinking,
now that your wedding is canceled...

535
00:37:56,191 --> 00:37:57,192
Uh...

536
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,203
You come from the sky.

537
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:05,201
Something tells me you have to return.

538
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:14,418
I am...

539
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:18,551
I am glad the katana sword
found a worthy owner.

540
00:38:18,922 --> 00:38:20,219
Me, too.

541
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,551
You.

542
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:27,559
Don't think I didn't see
how you stood up to the Shogun.

543
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:30,938
Even though he's gone,
your village still needs a protector.

544
00:38:36,189 --> 00:38:39,944
That sword...
What did you say your family name was?

545
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,282
Yamashiro.

546
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:44,447
Huh.

547
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:49,752
Thank you for loaning me your son's armor.

548
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:53,756
I'm sorry it got a bit dinged up
in the battle.

549
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:56,251
Then it served its purpose.

550
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,928
RORY: <i>Haircut. Steel.</i>

551
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:00,927
Sara says we got to clear out.

552
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:05,890
- Goodbye, Masako.
- Goodbye, Nate.

553
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:11,933
What an amazing time period.

554
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,478
Definitely my favorite,
besides the Old West.

555
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:17,572
Why are you two goofy bastards so happy?

556
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:19,941
You lost your damn suit, the food sucks,

557
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:21,826
and I got no proof ninjas exist.

558
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,172
What are you staring at?

559
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:42,676
- I've figured you out.
- Congratulations.

560
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:46,092
You act like this selfish meathead,

561
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,474
but secretly you're not so bad.

562
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:52,352
You know, you might even have
the makings of a hero.

563
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:54,851
Well, that proves one thing.

564
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:57,524
You don't know me.

565
00:39:58,938 --> 00:39:59,939
Perhaps not.

566
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:04,694
Trying to kill me again?

567
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:06,329
Trying to give you a present.

568
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:09,532
In case you ever need proof
you met an actual ninja.

569
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:26,966
All right, what's your secret?

570
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:30,687
What on earth do you mean?

571
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:32,560
Well, you two must be magicians

572
00:40:32,722 --> 00:40:35,646
considering how badly damaged
the <i>Waverider</i> was before we left.

573
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:40,063
Oh, that. Well, Jefferson and I went over
the ship top to bottom.

574
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:43,699
And it's safe to say there
are no surprises left on the <i>Waverider.</i>

575
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:47,578
Great. I'll go prep for takeoff.

576
00:40:52,742 --> 00:40:55,495
So, we gonna say something about
future-Barry's message or not?

577
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:59,173
Barry was very clear about the team
not knowing what he told Captain Hunter.

578
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:03,095
- Except now we know.
- Indeed.

579
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:04,929
You were right, Jefferson.

580
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:09,096
Some things you just can't un-see.

581
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:17,442
I think it's time we said <i>sayonara</i>
to feudal Japan.

582
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:19,022
Now, where to next?

583
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:22,231
I could always open the hatch,
jump out, and see where I land.

584
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:25,234
I say we just sit back and
see where the timestream takes us.

585
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,869
Aren't you forgetting
that Rex's killer is still at large?

586
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:29,571
Not my problem.

587
00:41:31,698 --> 00:41:34,542
I mean, we should
find the bastard and kill him.

588
00:41:34,701 --> 00:41:36,624
Perhaps we can enjoy
a little takeoff music?

589
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:41,090
Ah, nice one, Gideon.

590
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:43,464
GIDEON: <i>Captain Hunter
always enjoyed this song.</i>

591
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:46,425
Speaking of problems...

592
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:49,758
Don't worry. We're gonna find Rip
and Hourman's killer.

593
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:53,428
In the meantime, everyone just shut up
and let me do the flying.
