1
00:01:12,946 --> 00:01:15,031
Pull yourself together Teddy!

2
00:01:15,115 --> 00:01:16,616
Pull yourself together!

3
00:01:21,872 --> 00:01:23,457
It's just water.

4
00:01:25,417 --> 00:01:27,335
It's a lot of water.

5
00:01:33,758 --> 00:01:34,551
Come on.

6
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:03,205
- You okay boss?
- Yeah, I'm fine. I just... I just can't

7
00:02:03,914 --> 00:02:06,792
I just can't stomach the water.

8
00:02:08,794 --> 00:02:12,631
- So you're my new partner?
- That's right.

9
00:02:13,173 --> 00:02:16,009
Not the best way to meet with my head
halfway down the toilet.

10
00:02:16,009 --> 00:02:19,805
Doesn't exactly square with Teddy Daniels:
The man. The legend. I'll give you that.

11
00:02:19,805 --> 00:02:20,889
The Legend?

12
00:02:21,848 --> 00:02:24,101
What the hell are you boys smoking
out there in Portland anyway?

13
00:02:24,142 --> 00:02:24,810
Seattle.

14
00:02:25,894 --> 00:02:29,022
I came from the office in Seattle.

15
00:02:30,232 --> 00:02:32,275
How long have you been with Marshals?

16
00:02:32,275 --> 00:02:33,318
Four years.

17
00:02:35,737 --> 00:02:38,365
- So you know how small it is?
- Sure

18
00:02:40,534 --> 00:02:43,870
What about you? You got a girl? Married?

19
00:02:44,496 --> 00:02:45,122
I was.

20
00:02:57,509 --> 00:02:58,385
She died.

21
00:02:59,386 --> 00:03:03,473
- Jesus... I didn't...
- Don't worry about it.

22
00:03:04,224 --> 00:03:07,436
There was a fire at the apartment
building while I was at work

23
00:03:07,436 --> 00:03:09,020
Four People died.

24
00:03:09,312 --> 00:03:12,649
It was the smoke that got her
not the fire. So...

25
00:03:12,649 --> 00:03:15,068
- So that's important.
- I'm sorry Boss.

26
00:03:15,068 --> 00:03:17,696
Where are my goddamn cigarettes?

27
00:03:19,322 --> 00:03:20,574
Well here. Have one of mine.

28
00:03:20,574 --> 00:03:24,035
I could of sworn they were in my jacket
when I got on.

29
00:03:24,035 --> 00:03:27,205
Government employees will rob you blind.

30
00:03:29,124 --> 00:03:29,708
Thanks.

31
00:03:31,501 --> 00:03:33,962
They give you a briefing
about the institution before you left?

32
00:03:33,962 --> 00:03:37,466
All I know is it's a mental hospital.

33
00:03:37,966 --> 00:03:40,385
For the criminally insane.

34
00:03:40,927 --> 00:03:43,096
Well, if it was just folks running around,
hearing voices,

35
00:03:43,096 --> 00:03:48,185
and chasing after butterflies,
they wouldn't need us.

36
00:03:55,901 --> 00:03:59,029
- That's where we're headed?
- Yup.

37
00:03:59,071 --> 00:04:01,573
The other side of the island is rock bluffs

38
00:04:01,615 --> 00:04:03,617
all the way down to the edge
of the water.

39
00:04:04,201 --> 00:04:07,954
The dock, it's the
only way on...or off.

40
00:04:08,372 --> 00:04:11,708
We will be casting off as soon as
you two are ashore.

41
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:14,294
I'd appreciate if you'd hurry up about it.

42
00:04:14,294 --> 00:04:16,588
- Why?
- Storm's coming.

43
00:04:43,532 --> 00:04:47,285
I've never seen a marshal's
badge before.

44
00:04:48,328 --> 00:04:49,871
I'm Deputy Warden
McPherson, gentlemen.

45
00:04:49,871 --> 00:04:55,794
Welcome to Shutter Island.
I'll be the one taking you up to Ashecliffe.

46
00:05:06,555 --> 00:05:09,474
Your boys seem a little on edge
Mr. McPherson.

47
00:05:09,474 --> 00:05:12,310
Right now, Marshal. We all are.

48
00:05:29,286 --> 00:05:34,374
"Remember us for we too have
lived, loved and laughed"

49
00:05:55,812 --> 00:05:57,773
Electrified perimeter.

50
00:05:59,775 --> 00:06:01,026
How could you tell?

51
00:06:02,277 --> 00:06:05,572
I've seen something like it before.

52
00:06:33,141 --> 00:06:36,812
All right. You gentlemen will be accorded
all the help we can give.

53
00:06:36,812 --> 00:06:41,566
But during the stay you will
obey protocol. Is that understood?

54
00:06:41,566 --> 00:06:42,567
Absolutely.

55
00:06:43,485 --> 00:06:46,905
The red brick bulding on my right
is ward A, the male ward.

56
00:06:46,905 --> 00:06:49,908
Ward B, the female ward, is the one
on the left.

57
00:06:49,908 --> 00:06:53,412
Ward C is that building on the bluffs.
An old civil war fort.

58
00:06:55,122 --> 00:06:57,541
The most dangerous patients
are housed there.

59
00:06:57,541 --> 00:07:01,837
Admittance to ward C is forbidden without
the written consent and

60
00:07:01,837 --> 00:07:04,715
physical presence of both myself and Dr. Cawly.

61
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:06,508
Is that understood?

62
00:07:07,634 --> 00:07:10,721
You act like insanity is catching.

63
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:17,728
You are hereby required to surrending
your firearms.

64
00:07:17,811 --> 00:07:21,273
Mr. McPherson, we are duly appointed
federal marshals.

65
00:07:21,273 --> 00:07:23,775
We are required to carry our
firearms with us at all times.

66
00:07:23,775 --> 00:07:26,820
Executive order 319 of the Federal Code of
Penitentiaries states that:

67
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,989
when inside the penitentiary

68
00:07:28,989 --> 00:07:34,161
the offices of that institution
have final authority.

69
00:07:35,245 --> 00:07:42,502
Gentlemen, you will not get through
this gate with your firearms.

70
00:07:58,477 --> 00:08:02,022
Okay. Now that the official stuff is done,
come on boys.

71
00:08:02,022 --> 00:08:05,651
What do you say we go find Dr. Cawley?

72
00:08:16,119 --> 00:08:18,914
So when did she escape? This prisoner?

73
00:08:18,914 --> 00:08:22,042
I'm afraid that Dr. Cawley will have to
fill you in on the situation.

74
00:08:22,042 --> 00:08:22,876
Protocol.

75
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:25,462
Correctional officers at a mental institution.

76
00:08:25,462 --> 00:08:27,881
That's a weird sight,
if you don't mind me saying

77
00:08:27,881 --> 00:08:30,092
It's the only facility of it's kind in the U.S.
Even in the world.

78
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:33,845
We take only the
most dangerous, damaged patients.

79
00:08:33,845 --> 00:08:37,808
Ones no other hospital can manage.
And it's all due to Dr. Cawley.

80
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:44,147
He's created something really unique here.
It's a hospital for people our society normally...

81
00:09:11,508 --> 00:09:13,010
ID's, gentlemen.

82
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,557
Show your badges, gentlemen.

83
00:09:18,807 --> 00:09:21,101
Dr. Cawley's been consulted
numerous times

84
00:09:21,101 --> 00:09:25,314
- By Scotland Yard, MI5, the OSS...
- Why?

85
00:09:25,355 --> 00:09:27,024
What do you mean?

86
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:32,988
What do intelligence agencies want
to consult a psychatrist about?

87
00:09:32,988 --> 00:09:35,908
I guess you'll have to ask him.

88
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:47,377
- Marshal Daniels.
- Doctor.

89
00:09:47,377 --> 00:09:48,670
Marshal Aule.

90
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:53,717
- Thank you deputy warden, that will be all.
- Yes, sir.

91
00:09:53,717 --> 00:09:55,511
Pleasure, gentlemen.

92
00:09:56,553 --> 00:09:58,347
He had a lot to say about you.

93
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:01,475
McPherson is a good man.
He believes in the work we do here.

94
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:03,936
And what would that be exactly?

95
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:07,523
A moral fusion between law and
order and clinical care.

96
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:11,818
Pardon me Doc...
a what between what and what?

97
00:10:17,407 --> 00:10:20,619
Those paintings are quite accurate.

98
00:10:20,619 --> 00:10:23,497
It used to be that the kind of patients we
deal with here

99
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:26,208
were shackled and left in their own filth.

100
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:29,545
They were beaten. As if whipping
them bloody would drive the psychosis out.

101
00:10:29,753 --> 00:10:36,343
We drove screws into their brains. We submerged
them in icy water until they lost consciousness.

102
00:10:36,343 --> 00:10:37,678
Or even drown.

103
00:10:38,303 --> 00:10:40,389
- And now?
- We treat them.

104
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:42,641
Try to heal, try to cure.

105
00:10:42,891 --> 00:10:47,563
And if this fails, at least we provide them
with a measure of comfort in their lives. Calm.

106
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:48,689
These are...

107
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:51,942
all violent offenders, right?

108
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:53,819
They've hurt people.

109
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:58,115
- Murdered them in some cases.
- In almost all cases. Yes.

110
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:03,871
Then personally Doctor, I'd have to
say... screw their sense of calm.

111
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:07,791
It's my job to treat my patients not
their victims. I'm not here to judge.

112
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:11,378
- So this female prisoner...
- Patient.

113
00:11:11,378 --> 00:11:15,007
Excuse me, patient.
One Rachel Solando,

114
00:11:16,049 --> 00:11:18,760
- Escaped sometime in the last 24 hours.

115
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,846
Last night, between 10 and midnight.

116
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:24,183
- Is she considered dangerous?
- You could say that.

117
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,685
She killed all three of her children.

118
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:29,813
She drowned them in the lake behind her house.

119
00:11:29,813 --> 00:11:33,233
She took them out one by one and held their
heads under until they died.

120
00:11:33,233 --> 00:11:36,820
Then she brought them back inside and
arranged them around the kitchen table.

121
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:41,033
She ate a meal there
before a neighbor dropped by.

122
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,743
And what about the husband?

123
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:47,331
He died. On the beaches of Normandy.
She is a war widow.

124
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:54,880
She starved herself when first she came here.
She insisted the children weren't dead.

125
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:06,892
- Sorry doctor. You wouldn't happen to have an aspirin? Do you?
- Prone to headaches marshal.

126
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,769
Sometimes, but today...

127
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:11,980
- I'm a little more prone to seasickness.
- Ah, Dehydration...

128
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,649
- You alright boss?
- Yes.

129
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:16,777
In that case you're quite right.
The simpler the better.

130
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:18,445
Thank you so much.

131
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:22,825
Rachel still believes
her children are alive.

132
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:27,496
She also believes this place is her home
in the Berckshires.

133
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:28,664
You're kidding me.

134
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:31,834
She's never once in two years acknowledged
that she is in an institution.

135
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,252
She believes we're all...

136
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,754
deliveryman, milkman, postal workers.

137
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:40,384
To sustain the illusion that her children never died,
she's created an elaborate fictional structure.

138
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:44,638
She gives us all parts to play in that fiction.

139
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:49,143
- So have you searched the grounds yet?
- The warden and his men scoured the island,

140
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,352
not a trace.

141
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:55,983
What's more disturbing is, we don't know
how she got out of her room.

142
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:58,360
It was locked from the outside

143
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,196
and the only window is barred.

144
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:07,870
It's as if she evaporated straight
through the walls.

145
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:16,003
Brought her right back here after
group therapy, locked her in

146
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:20,591
I came back for a midnight round
and she was gone.

147
00:13:25,637 --> 00:13:29,975
Seriously doctor, how is it possible
that the truth never gets through to her?

148
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:33,062
I mean, she's in a
mental institution, right?

149
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,147
Seems like something you'd
notice from time to time.

150
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:38,776
- How many pairs of shoes are the patients given?
- Two pairs.

151
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,986
Sanity is not a choice, marshal,

152
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,781
You can't just choose to get over it.

153
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:46,450
So... she left here barefoot?

154
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:51,955
Come on Doc, she couldn't get ten
yards in that terrain.

155
00:13:51,955 --> 00:13:52,790
Marshal?

156
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,228
Well this is definitely Rachel's
handwriting.

157
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:18,857
- I have no idea what the "law of 4" is, though.
- It's not a psychiatric term?

158
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:20,109
I'm afraid not.

159
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,068
Who's 67?

160
00:14:22,861 --> 00:14:24,029
Fuck if I know!

161
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:27,366
I'd have to say that's quite
close to my clinical conclusion.

162
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,868
So you think it's
random scribblings?

163
00:14:29,868 --> 00:14:33,831
Oh no, not at all. Rachel is smart.
Brilliant in fact.

164
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:36,959
- This paper could be important.
- Excuse me Doctor, but...

165
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,796
- We're gonna have to hold onto this.
- Of course.

166
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:44,466
And you say she had to come through here.

167
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:48,512
After lights out, the orderlies play
cards in here.

168
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:53,726
Last night there were 7 men sitting
at the base of those stairs playing stud poker.

169
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:57,521
Yet somehow, Rachel managed
to slip past them.

170
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:57,980
Why?

171
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:01,817
How? She turns invisible?

172
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:05,404
Doctor, we're gonna need access to personnel files
of all the medical staff.

173
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,364
The nurses, the guards, the orderlies.

174
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:10,868
- Anyone who was working then.
- We'll take your request under consideration.

175
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:13,662
This is not a request, Doctor.

176
00:15:13,912 --> 00:15:16,457
This is a federal facility
and a dangerous prisoner...

177
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,542
- Patient.
- Patient...

178
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:23,297
- has escaped now. You will comply...
- All I can say is that I will see what I can do.

179
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:28,719
Doctor, we're gonna need to speak with the staff,
do you understand?

180
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:31,972
I'll assemble them in the
common room after dinner.

181
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:39,730
If you have any further questions feel
free to join the deputy warden in the search.

182
00:15:48,947 --> 00:15:52,409
It's 11 miles to the nearest land
and the water is freezing.

183
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:55,621
The current was strong last night.
The tide pushing in.

184
00:15:55,621 --> 00:16:03,337
She'd have drowned or been crushed on the
rocks, and her body would have washed back up onshore.

185
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:06,590
What about those caves down there,
have you checked them?

186
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,176
No way she could get there.

187
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:13,347
The base of those cliffs are covered
in poison ivy, live oak, sumac

188
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:16,892
and a thousand plants with thorns
as big as my dick.

189
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:21,563
You said it yourself marshal,
she's got no shoes.

190
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:29,571
All right!
Let's check the other side!

191
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:37,121
- What's that tower?
- It's an old lighthouse.

192
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:40,708
The guards already searched inside it.

193
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:46,422
- What's in there? More patients?
- Sewage treatment facility.

194
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,424
It's getting dark soon.

195
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,592
I'm calling this off for the night.

196
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:52,052
Let's go, boys!

197
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,559
- You were on watch on the landing, huh?
- Yeah.

198
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:03,439
Can't nobody get in or out of their room
in that corridor without me seeing.

199
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,316
Okay, Rachel Solando,

200
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:09,862
who else does she have to pass
to get down here?

201
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:14,617
Me.

202
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:16,910
Glen Miga.

203
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:22,291
- Sir, I didn't see nothing.
- And you were at your post all night?

204
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,501
Yes. But I didn't see a thing.

205
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:27,588
Glen.

206
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:30,549
Glen.

207
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,220
Tell me the truth.

208
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:42,227
I maybe... went to the bathroom.

209
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:47,942
- What? You breached protocol? Christ...
- I wasn't gone more than a minute.

210
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:50,778
All right, let's back up here.
Let's all just back up.

211
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:54,323
Miss Solando was put in
her room for lights out.

212
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:57,451
Does anybody here know
what she did before that?

213
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:58,160
Anyone?

214
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:02,748
Come on. Anyone. Anyone. Anyone.

215
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:06,418
She was in a group therapy session.

216
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:09,546
Huh. Did anything unusual occur?

217
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:11,215
Define "unusual".

218
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:15,219
- Excuse me.
- It's a mental institution, marshal.

219
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,221
For criminally insane.

220
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:20,849
"Usual", isn't a big part of our day.

221
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:22,768
I will rephrase.

222
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:27,106
Did anything happen last night
during group therapy, that was more...

223
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:30,234
- let's say, more memorable than...
- Normal?

224
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:30,985
Exactly!

225
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,237
No. I'm sorry.

226
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:38,450
Did Mrs. Solando say anything
during group therapy?

227
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,328
She was worried about the rain.

228
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:43,789
And she hated the food here.

229
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:47,710
Complained constantly.
Last night included.

230
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:51,922
So... you were there.
Was there a doctor present?

231
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:54,216
Yes. Dr. Sheehan led the discussion.

232
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:56,802
Dr. Sheehan?

233
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:01,181
Yes. He was running the session.

234
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,601
He's Rachels's "primary".

235
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:08,105
The psychaiatrist who directly
oversees her care.

236
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:11,025
We're gonna need to speak with Dr. Sheehan.

237
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:13,611
I'm afraid that won't be possible.

238
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:16,989
He left on the ferry this morning.
His vacation was already planned.

239
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,908
He'd putting it off too long.

240
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:21,327
You're in a state of lockdown.

241
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,954
A dangerous patient has escaped

242
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:28,417
and you let her primary doctor
leave on vacation?

243
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,753
Of course, he's a doctor.

244
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:38,844
Do you have the phone number for
where he's gone?

245
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,095
Hello? Hello?

246
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:43,432
Hello?

247
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,143
Is anybody there?

248
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:49,522
I'm sorry sir, but its all down.
All the lines.

249
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,190
The storm's hitting the
mainland like a hammer.

250
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:55,986
If you get it working, come find me immediately.
The marshalls need to make an important call.

251
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:56,862
Yes, sir.

252
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:06,497
I'm afraid I have evening rounds in the wards,

253
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:09,500
But I'll be having drinks and a cigar at
my house around 9

254
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,418
If you'd care to drop by

255
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:14,255
Good, we can talk then, right?

256
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:18,843
We have been talking, marshal.

257
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:38,154
Gotta say, I'm thinking I got
into the wrong line of public service.

258
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:41,240
It is a little overwhelming.
it was constructed during the Civil War

259
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,911
The same time as the military fort
housing ward C.

260
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:56,255
This is the original commander's quarters.
When Uncle Sam got the bill

261
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,965
the commander was court-martialed.

262
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,300
I can see why.

263
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:03,137
Nice music. Who is that? Brahms?

264
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:03,929
No.

265
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,273
It's Mahler.

266
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:17,067
Quite right, marshal.

267
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:22,865
Forgive me, gentlemen...
My colleague, Dr. Jeremiah Naehring.

268
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:32,917
"Quartet for Piano and Strings
in A minor"

269
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:39,173
- Your poison, gentlemen?
- Rye, if you've got it.

270
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:41,675
Soda and ice please, thanks.

271
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:44,261
You don't indulge in alcohol?

272
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,679
I am surprised.

273
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:50,643
Isn't it common for men in your
profession to imbibe?

274
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:53,020
Common enough.
And yours?

275
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:59,610
- I'm sorry?
- Your profession, doctor. Psychiatry...

276
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:03,447
I've always heard it was overrun
with boozers and drunks.

277
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,574
Not that I've noticed.

278
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:10,162
What's that? Iced tea in your glass there?

279
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,831
Excellent marshal.

280
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:15,000
You have outstanding defense mechanisms.

281
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,796
You must be quite adept at interrogations, hmm?

282
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:30,307
Men like you... are my specialty.
You know?

283
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,726
Men of violence.

284
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:36,063
That's a hell of an assumption to make...

285
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:41,277
No assumption. Not at all. You misunderstand
me, I said you are men of violence

286
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:45,656
I'm not accusing you of being violent men.
That's quite different.

287
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:48,451
Please, please, edify us, doctor.

288
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,122
You both served overseas.

289
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:58,127
Not much of a stretch, Doc. For all you know,
we were both paper pushers over there

290
00:22:58,127 --> 00:22:59,754
No, you were not.

291
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:21,692
Since the schoolyard, neither of
you has ever walked away from a physical conflict.

292
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:27,114
Not because you enjoy it, but because retreat
wasn't something you considered an option.

293
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:29,450
We weren't raised to run, Doc.

294
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:31,619
Ah, yes... Raised.

295
00:23:34,205 --> 00:23:36,707
and who raised you, marshal?

296
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:37,041
Me?

297
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:40,086
Wolves.

298
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:47,385
Very impressive defense mechanisms.

299
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:49,155
Do you believe in God, marshal?

300
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:55,745
I'm quite serious.

301
00:24:58,164 --> 00:24:59,582
That's rubbish.

302
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:05,838
Have you ever seen... a death camp, doctor?

303
00:25:06,547 --> 00:25:11,218
[In German]
I have, I was there, for the liberation of Dakau.

304
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:19,435
Your English is very good, almost flawless.

305
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:25,524
His English is very good.
You hit the consonants a tad hard, though.

306
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:26,901
You're German?

307
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:35,618
- Is legal immigration a crime, marshal?
- Oh I don't know doctor, you to tell us.

308
00:25:35,618 --> 00:25:40,706
Now listen, we're gonne need those files on Sheehan
and the rest of staff as well.

309
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:43,668
No personnel files will be released for you.
Period.

310
00:25:43,668 --> 00:25:46,921
- We're gonna need those files.
- Out of the question.

311
00:25:46,921 --> 00:25:49,924
Bullshit, out of the question!
Bullshit!

312
00:25:49,924 --> 00:25:52,510
Who the hell is in charge here anyway, huh?

313
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:56,472
Dr. Naehring acts as liaison to
our board of overseers.

314
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:58,641
He relayed your request and it's been refused.

315
00:25:58,641 --> 00:26:02,019
Refused? They don't have the authority
to refuse. And neither do you, sir.

316
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:05,815
Marshal, continue your investigation
and we will do all we can to help.

317
00:26:05,815 --> 00:26:07,733
This investigation is over.

318
00:26:07,775 --> 00:26:10,236
We're gonna file our reports
and hand it over to...

319
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:13,072
- Hoover's boys.
- Hoover's boys, that's right.

320
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:15,157
We'll be taking the ferry back in the morning.

321
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:16,534
Come on, Chuck.

322
00:26:25,376 --> 00:26:26,460
Nice night.

323
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:36,595
You'll be bunking in the orderlies quarter.

324
00:26:47,607 --> 00:26:51,360
Hey boss?... We really packing it in?

325
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:52,612
Why?

326
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:58,784
I guess, I dunno, I just...
never really quit anything before.

327
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:02,413
We haven't heard the truth once yet, Chuck.

328
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:08,461
Listen. Rachel Solando did not slip out of
a locked cell barefoot without any help.

329
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:10,546
I think she had alot of help.

330
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:13,174
Maybe Cawley's sitting up in his mansion
right now,

331
00:27:13,174 --> 00:27:15,885
rethinking his whole attitude.

332
00:27:16,928 --> 00:27:20,806
- Maybe in the morning...
- You're bluffing?

333
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:22,683
I didn't say that.

334
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:44,538
I found a whole stack of these, Teddy.

335
00:27:44,538 --> 00:27:47,458
Jesus, are you ever sober anymore?

336
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:50,795
I killed alot of people in the war.

337
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:54,423
Is that why you drink?

338
00:27:57,051 --> 00:27:58,344
Are you real?

339
00:27:59,470 --> 00:27:59,845
No.

340
00:28:04,976 --> 00:28:06,644
She's still here.

341
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:07,645
Who?

342
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,189
Rachel?

343
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:14,068
She never left.

344
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:32,211
Remember when we stayed in the cabin
in the summer, Teddy?

345
00:28:32,253 --> 00:28:33,796
We were so happy.

346
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:37,300
She's here.

347
00:28:37,884 --> 00:28:39,343
You can't leave.

348
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:54,442
I'm not gonna leave.

349
00:28:55,943 --> 00:28:57,820
I love you so much.

350
00:29:02,283 --> 00:29:06,078
- I'm just bones in a box, Teddy.
- No.

351
00:29:07,288 --> 00:29:07,788
I am.

352
00:29:11,876 --> 00:29:13,836
You have to wake up.

353
00:29:15,129 --> 00:29:16,297
I won't go.

354
00:29:17,715 --> 00:29:18,925
You're here.

355
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,136
I'm not.

356
00:29:23,638 --> 00:29:25,765
You have to face that.

357
00:29:28,351 --> 00:29:29,393
But she is.

358
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:33,064
And so is he.

359
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:36,108
Who?

360
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:39,779
Laeddis.

361
00:29:45,243 --> 00:29:46,577
I have to go.

362
00:29:50,373 --> 00:29:52,208
No! Please...just let me hold you.

363
00:29:52,834 --> 00:29:55,378
- Just a little bit longer.
- Oh, Teddy...

364
00:29:55,378 --> 00:29:56,420
You have to let me go.

365
00:29:58,798 --> 00:29:59,841
I can't.

366
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:35,960
Ain't gonna be no ferry in this shit.

367
00:30:39,005 --> 00:30:39,672
Doctor.

368
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:42,133
Doctor, doctor.

369
00:30:42,925 --> 00:30:46,053
We need to interview the patients who
were in Rachel's group therapy session.

370
00:30:46,053 --> 00:30:47,930
I thought your investigation was finished?

371
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:50,975
It's not like we can take the ferry.

372
00:30:50,975 --> 00:30:55,563
Now was Rachel receiving any
other treatment for her illnesses?

373
00:30:55,563 --> 00:30:59,025
Do you know the state of the
mental health field these days, gentlemen?

374
00:30:59,025 --> 00:31:01,235
No. Not a clue doctor.

375
00:31:01,402 --> 00:31:01,861
War.

376
00:31:02,737 --> 00:31:05,656
The old school believes in
surgical intervention.

377
00:31:05,656 --> 00:31:11,120
Psychosurgery.
Procedures like the trans-orbital lobotomy.

378
00:31:11,245 --> 00:31:15,666
Some say the patients become reasonable, docile.
Others say they become zombies.

379
00:31:16,793 --> 00:31:18,711
- And the new school?
- Psycho pharmacology.

380
00:31:18,961 --> 00:31:21,339
A new drug has just been
approved called Thorazine.

381
00:31:21,339 --> 00:31:22,715
Which relaxes psychotic patients.

382
00:31:22,882 --> 00:31:24,091
You could say it tames them.

383
00:31:24,801 --> 00:31:26,385
- And which school are you in, Doc?
- Me?

384
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:30,264
I have this radical idea that if you treat a
patient with respect,

385
00:31:30,681 --> 00:31:31,599
listen to him,

386
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,644
try and understand,
you just might reach him.

387
00:31:41,067 --> 00:31:43,194
- These patients?
- Even these.

388
00:31:43,611 --> 00:31:45,988
What should be a last resort is
becoming a first response.

389
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,449
Give them a pill, put them in a corner,
and it all goes away.

390
00:31:50,118 --> 00:31:52,411
Rachel Solando was on a combination of drugs

391
00:31:52,745 --> 00:31:56,457
meant to keep her from becoming violent,
but it was only intermittently effective.

392
00:31:57,583 --> 00:32:01,295
The greatest obstacle to her recovery was
her refusal to face what she had done.

393
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:03,506
"Was."

394
00:32:04,757 --> 00:32:08,594
Is there a reason you keep referring to
your patient in the past tense, doctor?

395
00:32:12,432 --> 00:32:14,559
Look outside, marshal.

396
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:17,019
Why do you think?

397
00:32:22,942 --> 00:32:26,863
Next up is Peter Breen. Assaulted
his father's nurse with a broken glass.

398
00:32:26,904 --> 00:32:30,616
Nurse survived, but
her face permaanently disfigured.

399
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:31,951
I can't wait.

400
00:32:32,201 --> 00:32:35,413
She'd smiles at me.
She was so sweet.

401
00:32:35,413 --> 00:32:40,418
But... I could see it in her eyes.
She liked to be naked.

402
00:32:40,418 --> 00:32:42,128
To suck cock.

403
00:32:43,254 --> 00:32:45,131
Okay, Mr. Breen.

404
00:32:45,506 --> 00:32:49,093
And then she asked me if she can have
a glass of water?

405
00:32:49,093 --> 00:32:52,805
Alone in the kitchen?
Like that's no big deal?

406
00:32:52,805 --> 00:32:56,184
- Why was that a big deal?
- It was obvious.

407
00:32:56,184 --> 00:33:01,898
She wanted me to pull out my thing so she
could laugh at it.

408
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:03,066
Mr. Breen,

409
00:33:05,568 --> 00:33:09,322
we need to ask you some questions, okay?

410
00:33:10,448 --> 00:33:13,034
When I cut her she screamed

411
00:33:14,494 --> 00:33:15,078
But...

412
00:33:16,287 --> 00:33:17,663
She scared me.

413
00:33:18,164 --> 00:33:20,083
What did she expect?

414
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:21,542
Interesting.

415
00:33:22,752 --> 00:33:26,297
But we are here to talk
Rachel Solando, okay?

416
00:33:26,297 --> 00:33:27,840
Rachel Solando...

417
00:33:28,508 --> 00:33:30,760
Did you know she had drowned her own kids?

418
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,678
She drowned her kids!

419
00:33:33,054 --> 00:33:36,307
This is a sick fucking world
we live in. I'll tell you that...

420
00:33:36,307 --> 00:33:37,892
You know what? They should be gassed.

421
00:33:37,892 --> 00:33:41,145
All of them... the retards, the killers

422
00:33:41,521 --> 00:33:45,900
the niggers. You kill your own kid?
Gas the bitch!

423
00:33:48,194 --> 00:33:49,987
Would you... stop that?

424
00:33:51,739 --> 00:33:54,242
- A nurse?
- Please. Stop that.

425
00:33:54,242 --> 00:33:57,453
A nurse maybe. Maybe she had kids, huh?

426
00:33:58,788 --> 00:33:59,914
A husband...

427
00:34:01,916 --> 00:34:04,252
Just trying to make ends meet,

428
00:34:05,545 --> 00:34:07,797
to lead a normal life...

429
00:34:08,673 --> 00:34:10,842
And it says in your file that uh...

430
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:14,470
You tore her face off, didn't you?

431
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:21,269
Congratulations, no more normal
for her, not ever again, no.

432
00:34:21,936 --> 00:34:25,273
Do you know what she was afraid of?

433
00:34:27,233 --> 00:34:27,650
You.

434
00:34:28,276 --> 00:34:30,862
Could you stop that, please?!

435
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:33,281
Stop that!

436
00:34:34,741 --> 00:34:36,200
Please... stop!

437
00:34:36,617 --> 00:34:40,913
You know a patient by the name of Andrew Laeddis?

438
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,833
- I want to go back.
- Take him!

439
00:35:01,017 --> 00:35:02,977
I'll never get out of here.

440
00:35:02,977 --> 00:35:05,063
I'm not sure that I should.

441
00:35:06,439 --> 00:35:08,191
Excuse me for saying this,

442
00:35:08,191 --> 00:35:10,318
- Miss Kearns...
- Misses.

443
00:35:10,318 --> 00:35:11,444
Mrs. Kearns.

444
00:35:13,321 --> 00:35:14,781
But you seem...

445
00:35:15,406 --> 00:35:16,908
quite normal,...

446
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,661
I mean in comparison
with the other patients here.

447
00:35:19,661 --> 00:35:24,332
Well, I have my dark days
I suppose everybody does.

448
00:35:24,499 --> 00:35:30,129
The difference is that most people don't kill
their husbands with an axe.

449
00:35:30,129 --> 00:35:33,841
Although personally I think if a
man beats you and fucks

450
00:35:33,883 --> 00:35:38,429
half the women he sees
and no one will help you,

451
00:35:38,596 --> 00:35:43,726
axing him isn't the least understandable
thing you can do.

452
00:35:43,726 --> 00:35:46,354
Maybe you shouldn't get out.

453
00:35:46,854 --> 00:35:49,107
And what would I do if I did?

454
00:35:49,107 --> 00:35:52,694
I don't know the world anymore.
They say there are

455
00:35:52,694 --> 00:35:55,905
bombs that can reduce whole
cities to ash

456
00:35:55,905 --> 00:35:59,033
And what do they call "televisions"...

457
00:35:59,033 --> 00:36:02,245
voices and faces coming from a box.

458
00:36:02,453 --> 00:36:05,039
I hear enough voices already

459
00:36:05,498 --> 00:36:08,710
What can you tell us about Rachel?

460
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:14,007
Um. Not much, she... she keeps to herself.

461
00:36:14,799 --> 00:36:18,303
She believed her kids were alive.

462
00:36:18,303 --> 00:36:23,850
She thought she was still living
in the Berkshires and we were all neighbours

463
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:26,853
- The milkman, postmen...
- Deliveryman,

464
00:36:28,354 --> 00:36:30,607
And Dr. Sheehan was there that night?

465
00:36:30,607 --> 00:36:31,065
Yes. Um.

466
00:36:32,734 --> 00:36:34,819
He talked about anger.

467
00:36:36,988 --> 00:36:38,906
Tell me about him...

468
00:36:39,407 --> 00:36:40,908
What's he like?

469
00:36:41,492 --> 00:36:42,702
I think he's uh...

470
00:36:46,706 --> 00:36:47,707
Okay... nice.

471
00:36:49,834 --> 00:36:54,213
Not hard on the eyes
as my mother would say.

472
00:36:54,797 --> 00:36:57,550
Did he ever make a pass at you?

473
00:36:57,634 --> 00:36:58,009
No.

474
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:04,349
No, Dr. Sheehan is a good
doctor, he would never...

475
00:37:06,225 --> 00:37:08,311
Could I have a glass of water, please?

476
00:37:08,311 --> 00:37:09,354
No problem.

477
00:37:24,577 --> 00:37:26,412
Thank you, marshal.

478
00:37:31,042 --> 00:37:35,046
I have just one more question for you
Mrs. Kearns.

479
00:37:37,507 --> 00:37:40,385
Did you ever meet a patient
named Andrew Laeddis?

480
00:37:43,763 --> 00:37:44,430
No.

481
00:37:46,266 --> 00:37:48,101
Never heard of him.

482
00:37:53,815 --> 00:37:55,358
She was coached.

483
00:37:55,567 --> 00:37:59,028
She used practically the same words as
Cawley and the nurse.

484
00:37:59,028 --> 00:38:01,990
- Like she'd been told exactly what to say.
- Who is Andrew Laeddis?

485
00:38:06,494 --> 00:38:11,708
You asked every one of those patients
back there about him. Who is he?

486
00:38:14,544 --> 00:38:17,797
What the hell, boss, I'm your partner
for the Christ's sake!

487
00:38:17,964 --> 00:38:19,924
We just met, Chuck.

488
00:38:20,383 --> 00:38:22,135
You've been on the beat a long time.

489
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:26,514
You got a duty, got a career.
What I'm doing,

490
00:38:26,514 --> 00:38:28,808
is not exactly by the book.

491
00:38:30,143 --> 00:38:36,816
I don't give a damn about "by the book", boss
I just to know what the hell is going on.

492
00:38:40,069 --> 00:38:43,364
When this case came over the wires,

493
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:48,578
- I requested it specifically. Do you understand?
- Why?

494
00:38:50,205 --> 00:38:51,581
Andrew Laeddis,

495
00:38:52,832 --> 00:38:57,587
was the maintenance man in the apartment
building where my wife and I lived.

496
00:38:58,463 --> 00:38:59,172
Okay.

497
00:39:01,591 --> 00:39:03,718
He was also a firebug.

498
00:39:06,387 --> 00:39:09,057
Andrew Laeddis lit the match,

499
00:39:11,726 --> 00:39:15,563
that caused the fire that killed my wife.

500
00:39:22,737 --> 00:39:23,613
Let 'em out!

501
00:39:26,783 --> 00:39:28,868
What happened to Laeddis?

502
00:39:28,868 --> 00:39:32,872
Got away with it.
Laeddis got away with it and disappeared.

503
00:39:33,373 --> 00:39:35,667
About a year ago, I opened up the
newspaper and there he is.

504
00:39:35,667 --> 00:39:37,836
He's an ugly looking son of a bitch.

505
00:39:37,836 --> 00:39:40,463
He had a new scar from his right temple
down to his left lip.

506
00:39:40,463 --> 00:39:43,883
Eyes different colors.
Not the type of face you forget.

507
00:39:43,883 --> 00:39:47,053
He'd burned down a schoolhouse. Killed 2 people.

508
00:39:47,053 --> 00:39:48,972
He said voices told him to do it.

509
00:39:48,972 --> 00:39:51,683
First he was sent to prison
and then he was transferred here.

510
00:39:51,683 --> 00:39:53,852
- Then what?
- Then, nothing.

511
00:39:53,852 --> 00:39:57,814
He vanished like he never existed.
No record whatsoever.

512
00:39:57,814 --> 00:40:00,483
I'm sure he's not in ward B
that leaves ward C.

513
00:40:00,483 --> 00:40:01,693
Or he could be dead.

514
00:40:01,693 --> 00:40:07,282
So could Rachel Solando for that matter.
Lot of places to hide a body here.

515
00:40:07,824 --> 00:40:11,619
Only one place
no one really knows.

516
00:40:22,172 --> 00:40:26,217
That patient, Bridget Kearne,
when she sent me for water,

517
00:40:26,217 --> 00:40:29,262
she said something to you back there, didn't she?

518
00:40:29,262 --> 00:40:29,596
No.

519
00:40:32,432 --> 00:40:33,725
Come on boss!

520
00:40:37,353 --> 00:40:38,646
She wrote it.

521
00:40:54,245 --> 00:40:54,746
Boss!

522
00:40:55,997 --> 00:40:59,667
We gotta get indoors. It's turning
into fucking Kansas out here...

523
00:40:59,667 --> 00:41:02,170
- All right.
- Now. Let's go!

524
00:41:04,631 --> 00:41:05,632
Watch out!

525
00:41:08,384 --> 00:41:08,968
Jesus!

526
00:41:11,513 --> 00:41:13,765
Come on! Let's go back!

527
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:33,326
Jesus Christ!
Damn it!

528
00:41:44,337 --> 00:41:48,591
- Are you okay boss?
- Yes. That's all right.

529
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:57,016
So... if Laeddis is here...

530
00:41:57,016 --> 00:41:59,894
What are you going to do boss?

531
00:42:01,479 --> 00:42:04,274
I'm not here to kill Leaddis.

532
00:42:11,656 --> 00:42:15,452
If it was my wife
I'd kill him twice.

533
00:42:25,211 --> 00:42:31,426
When we got through the gates of Dakau,
the SS guards surrendered.

534
00:42:38,308 --> 00:42:43,730
The commandante tried to kill himself
before we got there...

535
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:46,858
but he botched it.

536
00:42:48,026 --> 00:42:50,278
Took him an hour to die.

537
00:42:54,783 --> 00:42:59,329
When I went outside,
I saw all the bodies on the ground.

538
00:43:03,083 --> 00:43:04,751
Too many to count.

539
00:43:31,611 --> 00:43:33,530
Too many to imagine.

540
00:43:36,199 --> 00:43:36,950
So yeah

541
00:43:39,953 --> 00:43:45,583
The guards surrendered, we took
their guns, we lined them up...

542
00:44:27,959 --> 00:44:29,627
It wasn't warfare,

543
00:44:32,005 --> 00:44:33,340
it was murder.

544
00:44:37,719 --> 00:44:39,763
Yeah I've had enough of killing.

545
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:44,934
That's not why I'm here.

546
00:44:45,518 --> 00:44:47,854
So what is this all about?

547
00:44:49,898 --> 00:44:51,983
After Laeddis vanished,

548
00:44:52,942 --> 00:44:57,030
I started doing some checking
on Ashecliffe.

549
00:44:57,113 --> 00:45:02,160
A lot of people knew about this place, but no
one wants to talk...

550
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,163
You know? It's like they're scared of something.

551
00:45:06,039 --> 00:45:09,876
You know this place is funded by
a special grant

552
00:45:09,876 --> 00:45:13,088
from the House of
Unamerican Activities Committee.

553
00:45:13,088 --> 00:45:19,260
HUAC. And how exactly are we fighting
the Commies from an island in Boston Harbor?

554
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:22,639
By conducting experiments on the mind.

555
00:45:23,223 --> 00:45:24,724
At least that's my guess.

556
00:45:24,724 --> 00:45:26,726
And you think thats going on in here?

557
00:45:26,726 --> 00:45:29,020
Like I said, no one would talk, right?

558
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:31,856
Until I found someone
who used to be a patient here.

559
00:45:31,856 --> 00:45:33,733
Guy's name is George Noyce.

560
00:45:33,733 --> 00:45:36,361
Nice college kid.
Socialist.

561
00:45:36,569 --> 00:45:40,073
He gets offered some money to do a
psych study. Guess what they were testing?

562
00:45:40,073 --> 00:45:43,410
- Tooth paste?
- So he starts seeing dragons everywhere.

563
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:47,539
Almost beats his professor to death
Ends up here in Ashecliffe.

564
00:45:48,331 --> 00:45:49,040
Ward C.

565
00:45:49,332 --> 00:45:52,752
They released him after 1 year, right?
What does he do?

566
00:45:52,752 --> 00:45:58,550
Two weeks on the mainland he walks into
a bar and stabs three men to death.

567
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:01,428
His lawyer pleads insanity,
but Noyce...

568
00:46:01,428 --> 00:46:03,596
Noyce, he stands up in the courtroom and

569
00:46:03,596 --> 00:46:05,473
he begs the judge,
for the electric chair.

570
00:46:05,473 --> 00:46:08,393
Anywhere but a mental hospital.

571
00:46:08,393 --> 00:46:12,147
Judge gives him life in Dedham prison.

572
00:46:12,147 --> 00:46:16,276
- And you found him?
- Yeah, I found him.

573
00:46:16,276 --> 00:46:17,444
Well, he's a mess

574
00:46:19,404 --> 00:46:22,324
- But it's pretty clear from what he tells me, ...
- What?

575
00:46:22,324 --> 00:46:25,327
... they're experimenting on people here.

576
00:46:25,327 --> 00:46:27,287
I don't know, boss.

577
00:46:28,872 --> 00:46:31,583
- How do you believe a crazy guy?
- That's the beauty of it isn't it?

578
00:46:31,583 --> 00:46:36,296
Crazy people are perfect subjects.
They talk, but nobody listens.

579
00:46:36,296 --> 00:46:38,006
I stood in Dakau.

580
00:46:38,048 --> 00:46:43,219
We saw what human beings are capable
of doing to each other, right?

581
00:46:43,428 --> 00:46:45,513
For Christ sake we fought a goddamn war

582
00:46:45,513 --> 00:46:47,974
to stop them, and now
I find out it may be happening here?

583
00:46:47,974 --> 00:46:50,810
On our soil?
No.

584
00:46:51,895 --> 00:46:54,898
So what are you really here to do, Teddy?

585
00:46:54,898 --> 00:46:57,442
I'm gonna get the proof,

586
00:46:57,442 --> 00:47:01,696
I'm gonna go back, and blow
the lid off this place.

587
00:47:01,696 --> 00:47:02,614
That's it.

588
00:47:03,657 --> 00:47:05,033
Wait a minute.

589
00:47:06,243 --> 00:47:08,954
You started asking around about Ashecliffe.

590
00:47:08,954 --> 00:47:14,251
Waiting for a chance to get out here
then suddenly they need a US marshal?

591
00:47:14,251 --> 00:47:17,128
I got lucky. There was a patient escape,
it was the perfect excuse.

592
00:47:17,128 --> 00:47:20,215
No, no, no boss.
Luck doesn't work that way.

593
00:47:20,215 --> 00:47:24,928
The world doesn't work that way. They got an
electrified fence around a septic facility.

594
00:47:24,928 --> 00:47:28,181
Ward C is inside a Civil War fort?

595
00:47:28,515 --> 00:47:32,686
A chief of staff with ties to the OSS
Funding from HUAC?

596
00:47:32,686 --> 00:47:36,856
Jesus Christ! Everything about this place
stinks of "government ops".

597
00:47:36,856 --> 00:47:38,942
- What If they wanted you here?
- Bullshit.

598
00:47:38,942 --> 00:47:40,819
- You were asking questions.
- Bullshit.

599
00:47:40,819 --> 00:47:46,157
Bullshit? We came in for Rachel Solando? Where is
one shred of evidence that she even existed?

600
00:47:46,157 --> 00:47:48,618
There's no way they could of known I'd be
assigned to this case. No way...

601
00:47:48,618 --> 00:47:51,621
While you were looking into them,
they were looking into you.

602
00:47:51,621 --> 00:47:54,291
All they need to do
is fake an escape to get you here.

603
00:47:54,291 --> 00:47:59,254
And now they have you.
Now they have us both, here, now.

604
00:48:01,965 --> 00:48:03,383
Marshal, are you out here?

605
00:48:04,467 --> 00:48:06,636
This is deputy warden McPherson.

606
00:48:07,429 --> 00:48:08,138
Marshal!

607
00:48:08,513 --> 00:48:10,056
How about that? They found us huh.

608
00:48:10,056 --> 00:48:13,393
It's an island, boss. They're always gonna find us.

609
00:48:14,728 --> 00:48:15,854
I know you are in there...

610
00:48:17,689 --> 00:48:20,066
We're getting off of this Goddamned island.
You and me.

611
00:48:20,567 --> 00:48:21,526
Come on!

612
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:27,115
- Come on!
- Go!

613
00:48:37,125 --> 00:48:40,212
Get dried off.
Dr. Cawley wants to talk to you. Now!

614
00:48:41,004 --> 00:48:43,965
And hurry up, this thing is turning
into a goddamn hurricane!

615
00:48:49,596 --> 00:48:51,097
I dropped those suits off to be cleaned.

616
00:48:52,057 --> 00:48:53,141
It should be ready by tomorrow.

617
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:55,685
That is if we don't all wash away first.

618
00:48:56,853 --> 00:49:00,941
Speaking of which, I'm afraid your smokes were
pretty much done for.

619
00:49:01,691 --> 00:49:02,567
So...

620
00:49:04,736 --> 00:49:06,112
This is our only choice, huh?

621
00:49:06,947 --> 00:49:09,908
Got something really nice in prison already
if that don't work for you...

622
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,369
Now that you mention it, these are just fine.

623
00:49:13,828 --> 00:49:17,040
That's why I must repeat my insistence
that all ward C patients

624
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,375
be placed in manual restraints.

625
00:49:19,251 --> 00:49:22,504
If the facility floods, they'll drown.
You know that.

626
00:49:23,004 --> 00:49:25,382
- That would take a lot of flooding.
- We are on an island,

627
00:49:25,507 --> 00:49:26,967
in the middle of the ocean,
during a hurricane.

628
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:29,594
A lot of flooding seems like a
distinct possibility.

629
00:49:29,594 --> 00:49:32,347
It's a gamble, Steven.
Say the power fails, ...

630
00:49:32,597 --> 00:49:33,557
There's a backup generator.

631
00:49:33,807 --> 00:49:36,226
And if that goes? The cell doors
will open.

632
00:49:37,769 --> 00:49:39,312
Where are they going to go?

633
00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:43,358
They can't just hop a ferry, scoot over
to the mainland and wreak havoc.

634
00:49:43,358 --> 00:49:47,487
You're quite right. They're far more likely
to wreak havoc right here on us.

635
00:49:48,488 --> 00:49:50,282
If they're manacled to the floor, they'll die.

636
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:53,034
That's 24 human beings.

637
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:55,745
You can live with that, can you?

638
00:49:55,954 --> 00:49:57,539
Frankly, if it were up to me,

639
00:49:57,831 --> 00:50:01,209
I'd put all 42 in wards A and B in
manual restraints as well.

640
00:50:01,334 --> 00:50:02,169
Excuse me
Excuse me

641
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:06,840
- Marshal.
- I'm sorry doctor, I just have one quick question.

642
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,133
Yes, I will be with you in a moment.

643
00:50:08,133 --> 00:50:10,927
We spoke this morning
about Rachel Solando's note.

644
00:50:11,094 --> 00:50:12,762
The law of 4, I loved that.

645
00:50:12,762 --> 00:50:16,391
You said you had no idea what
that second line could refer to. Correct?

646
00:50:17,434 --> 00:50:18,602
Who is 67?

647
00:50:18,602 --> 00:50:22,355
Yes, I'm afraid I still don't.
None of us do.

648
00:50:22,355 --> 00:50:24,441
Uh huh. Nothing comes to mind.

649
00:50:27,277 --> 00:50:28,028
Nothing?

650
00:50:32,449 --> 00:50:34,326
Because I believe I just heard
you say there are

651
00:50:34,326 --> 00:50:37,037
24 patients in ward C.

652
00:50:37,746 --> 00:50:40,332
And 42 of patients, in wards A and B

653
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:43,960
Which means there is a total of what?
66 patients here in this facility.

654
00:50:45,253 --> 00:50:46,588
That is correct, yes.

655
00:50:49,883 --> 00:50:52,552
Then it seems that
Rachel Solando was suggesting

656
00:50:53,053 --> 00:50:56,306
that you have a 67th patient, doctor.

657
00:50:57,432 --> 00:51:00,769
- But I'm afraid we don't.
- This is ridiculous.

658
00:51:00,769 --> 00:51:03,313
- What are you doing here?
- We are doing our goddamn job.

659
00:51:04,105 --> 00:51:06,483
Didn't McPherson tell you the good news?

660
00:51:07,776 --> 00:51:09,444
No, what's the good news, doctor?

661
00:51:10,445 --> 00:51:11,822
Rachel has been found.

662
00:51:13,323 --> 00:51:14,282
She's here.

663
00:51:15,992 --> 00:51:17,035
Safe and sound.

664
00:51:29,256 --> 00:51:30,340
There is not a mark on her.

665
00:51:34,845 --> 00:51:35,846
Who are these men?

666
00:51:39,433 --> 00:51:40,851
Why are they in my house?

667
00:51:41,351 --> 00:51:42,769
Police officers, Rachel.

668
00:51:43,103 --> 00:51:45,439
They... have a few questions.

669
00:51:49,401 --> 00:51:50,110
Ma'am.

670
00:51:53,363 --> 00:51:56,533
There's been a sighting of a known
Communist

671
00:51:56,533 --> 00:51:59,995
subversive in this area
passing out literature

672
00:52:01,997 --> 00:52:03,373
Here?

673
00:52:05,542 --> 00:52:06,960
In this neighborhood?

674
00:52:07,502 --> 00:52:08,670
Yes, I'm afraid so.

675
00:52:10,297 --> 00:52:13,759
Now, if you can tell us what you did
yesterday, where you were,

676
00:52:14,426 --> 00:52:15,969
it would really help us narrow our search.

677
00:52:17,971 --> 00:52:18,597
Yes...

678
00:52:21,975 --> 00:52:22,976
Well, I...umm

679
00:52:26,605 --> 00:52:30,567
I made breakfast for Jim
and the children,

680
00:52:30,859 --> 00:52:32,110
and then I...

681
00:52:34,362 --> 00:52:37,616
I packed Jim's lunch
and he left.

682
00:52:40,118 --> 00:52:43,789
Then I sent the children off to school.

683
00:52:47,292 --> 00:52:48,335
And then...

684
00:52:54,966 --> 00:52:58,970
I decided to take a long swim in the lake.

685
00:53:04,976 --> 00:53:05,769
I see...

686
00:53:10,065 --> 00:53:11,525
And after that?

687
00:53:19,533 --> 00:53:20,742
After that...

688
00:53:30,335 --> 00:53:32,003
I thought of you.

689
00:53:38,218 --> 00:53:39,761
I... I'm sorry, ma'am.

690
00:53:39,761 --> 00:53:43,265
I don't know what you're talking about.

691
00:53:45,308 --> 00:53:49,229
Don't you know how lonely I've been, Jim?

692
00:53:54,067 --> 00:53:55,402
You're gone...

693
00:53:59,364 --> 00:54:00,574
You're dead.

694
00:54:05,704 --> 00:54:08,498
I cry every night.

695
00:54:13,587 --> 00:54:16,340
How am I supposed to survive?

696
00:54:18,383 --> 00:54:18,800
God.

697
00:54:29,311 --> 00:54:32,230
Rachel... it will be all right.

698
00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:37,611
I'm so sorry, but...

699
00:54:39,112 --> 00:54:42,324
everything is gonna be all right? Okay?

700
00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:45,160
I buried you.

701
00:54:47,496 --> 00:54:52,501
I buried an empty casket. Your body
rained down lumps of flesh splashing

702
00:54:52,501 --> 00:54:54,002
into the sea eaten by sharks.

703
00:54:58,131 --> 00:55:02,052
My Jim is dead,
So who the fuck are you?

704
00:55:04,137 --> 00:55:06,181
Who the fuck are you?!

705
00:55:06,765 --> 00:55:09,184
Who are you?! Who are you?!

706
00:55:19,111 --> 00:55:20,904
I'm sorry about that.

707
00:55:20,904 --> 00:55:24,324
I didn't want to interrupt, I thought
she might tell you something, but...

708
00:55:24,324 --> 00:55:26,451
we found her down by the lighthouse,

709
00:55:26,451 --> 00:55:27,911
skipping stones.

710
00:55:29,329 --> 00:55:33,041
We have no idea how she got out there. I'm going
to ask you both to go down into basement.

711
00:55:33,041 --> 00:55:37,212
There's food, water, and cots.
It's the safest place to be

712
00:55:37,212 --> 00:55:39,423
when the hurricane hits.

713
00:55:42,968 --> 00:55:45,053
Are you all right?
You look pale.

714
00:55:45,053 --> 00:55:47,222
I'm fine, it's just uh...

715
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:50,058
Boss, are you okay?

716
00:55:51,018 --> 00:55:53,437
It's just so Goddamn bright? Isn't it?

717
00:55:53,437 --> 00:55:58,108
Photo sensitivity, headaches sometimes?
Marshal are you having a migraine?

718
00:55:58,108 --> 00:55:59,234
I'll be alright.

719
00:56:07,367 --> 00:56:10,954
- What's wrong with him.
- Take these, marshal. You'll sleep a couple of hours, wake up clear as a bell.

720
00:56:10,954 --> 00:56:13,415
He's having a migraine.
Imagine someone sawed open your head and

721
00:56:13,415 --> 00:56:15,542
filled it with razors then shook it
as hard as they could.

722
00:56:15,542 --> 00:56:17,085
Take the pills, marshal.

723
00:56:17,085 --> 00:56:21,965
- No... I don't want the pills.
- It'll stop the pain. Take the pills.

724
00:56:25,594 --> 00:56:27,846
He's going to need to lie down.

725
00:56:33,352 --> 00:56:34,102
Oh God!

726
00:56:49,618 --> 00:56:51,453
Careful. All right.

727
00:56:52,829 --> 00:56:54,831
Gonna be okay. Relax.

728
00:57:01,672 --> 00:57:03,632
- Who is that?
- Him?

729
00:57:04,591 --> 00:57:06,301
That's the warden.

730
00:57:08,303 --> 00:57:11,390
Don't you worry about him, alright?

731
00:57:16,937 --> 00:57:19,606
Looks like an ex-military prick.

732
00:57:20,399 --> 00:57:24,278
You know what? I ain't gonna argue
with you on that one.

733
00:58:48,904 --> 00:58:51,281
You should have saved me.

734
00:58:53,283 --> 00:58:56,328
You should have saved all of us.

735
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:26,567
Hey buddy.

736
00:59:28,652 --> 00:59:29,403
Hey.

737
00:59:29,903 --> 00:59:30,654
Laeddis.

738
00:59:32,823 --> 00:59:34,199
Yes.

739
00:59:45,002 --> 00:59:46,003
Hi, buddy.

740
00:59:47,421 --> 00:59:49,631
No hard feelings, right?

741
00:59:56,054 --> 00:59:57,639
No hard feelings.

742
01:00:11,236 --> 01:00:13,697
Little something for later.

743
01:00:17,075 --> 01:00:19,786
Because I know how much you need it.

744
01:00:25,417 --> 01:00:27,920
Clock's ticking, my friend.

745
01:00:28,253 --> 01:00:30,798
We're running out of time.

746
01:00:40,057 --> 01:00:42,017
Give me a hand here.

747
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:06,750
I could get into trouble.

748
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:35,279
I'm dead?

749
01:01:38,490 --> 01:01:40,909
I'm so sorry.

750
01:01:41,201 --> 01:01:44,621
Why didn't you save me?

751
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:49,126
I tried, I wanted to,
but by the time I got there,

752
01:01:49,126 --> 01:01:50,711
it was too late.

753
01:02:13,484 --> 01:02:14,985
See?

754
01:02:16,904 --> 01:02:18,697
Aren't they beautiful?

755
01:03:13,127 --> 01:03:15,629
Why are you all wet, baby?

756
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:19,633
Laeddis isn't dead.

757
01:03:20,968 --> 01:03:22,344
He isn't gone.

758
01:03:23,846 --> 01:03:25,431
He's still here.

759
01:03:28,642 --> 01:03:29,393
I know.

760
01:03:29,685 --> 01:03:32,104
We need to find him, Teddy.

761
01:03:32,104 --> 01:03:35,065
You need to find him and
you kill him dead.

762
01:03:52,082 --> 01:03:53,125
Shhh. It's okay.

763
01:04:05,721 --> 01:04:06,305
Shh. Again!

764
01:04:06,764 --> 01:04:08,599
The generator is flooded.

765
01:04:13,562 --> 01:04:15,397
Are you okay boss?

766
01:04:17,608 --> 01:04:19,568
This goddamn migraine!

767
01:04:19,568 --> 01:04:24,198
Back up generators failed.
The whole place has gone crazy.

768
01:04:25,199 --> 01:04:27,451
What do you want to do?

769
01:04:32,831 --> 01:04:33,499
Christ!

770
01:04:34,208 --> 01:04:36,627
No, no, no!
Put it down.

771
01:04:37,169 --> 01:04:38,087
Now! Now!

772
01:04:49,014 --> 01:04:51,809
You think the whole
electrical system is fried?

773
01:04:51,809 --> 01:04:54,895
I'd say that it's a good possibility.

774
01:04:54,895 --> 01:04:56,897
All electronic security...

775
01:04:56,897 --> 01:04:58,732
fences, gates, the doors

776
01:04:59,775 --> 01:05:00,567
Come on.

777
01:05:00,901 --> 01:05:03,320
Nice day for a stroll
don't you think?

778
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:06,532
To ward C for example.

779
01:05:08,492 --> 01:05:11,495
Maybe we'll run into Andrew Leaddis.

780
01:05:15,708 --> 01:05:18,585
The guy I told you about, George Noyce?

781
01:05:18,585 --> 01:05:21,463
He told me this is where they keep
the worse ones.

782
01:05:21,463 --> 01:05:25,426
The guys even the other inmates
are scared of.

783
01:05:26,135 --> 01:05:28,429
Noyce give you anything on the layout?

784
01:05:28,429 --> 01:05:29,513
Not really.

785
01:05:29,763 --> 01:05:33,642
All that he remembers was people
scream day and night. There were no windows.

786
01:05:33,642 --> 01:05:36,103
There were bars everywhere.

787
01:05:56,415 --> 01:05:57,708
Jesus Christ!

788
01:05:58,667 --> 01:06:01,420
First time
on ward C, right?

789
01:06:01,754 --> 01:06:03,464
- Yes, yes...
- Yes.

790
01:06:03,464 --> 01:06:07,676
- Yeah, heard stories, but...
- Trust me, sons. You haven't heard shit.

791
01:06:07,676 --> 01:06:10,179
We got most of the bugsies locked down now,

792
01:06:10,179 --> 01:06:12,222
But some of them are still loose.

793
01:06:12,222 --> 01:06:14,975
If you see one don't try
to restrain him yourselves.

794
01:06:14,975 --> 01:06:16,685
These fuckers will kill you.

795
01:06:16,685 --> 01:06:17,269
Clear?

796
01:06:18,395 --> 01:06:21,899
Alright. Get your asses moving then.
Go on.

797
01:07:18,122 --> 01:07:19,123
He's here.

798
01:07:23,294 --> 01:07:24,086
Laeddis.

799
01:07:25,588 --> 01:07:27,089
I can feel him.

800
01:07:30,926 --> 01:07:32,511
Tag! You're it.

801
01:07:34,179 --> 01:07:34,597
Ted!

802
01:08:30,736 --> 01:08:32,029
Listen to me!

803
01:08:32,696 --> 01:08:34,782
Listen!
I do not want to leave, all right?

804
01:08:35,074 --> 01:08:39,203
Why would anyone want to?
We hear things here.

805
01:08:39,203 --> 01:08:41,830
About the outside world.
About atolls.

806
01:08:41,830 --> 01:08:44,542
About the h-bomb tests.

807
01:08:44,542 --> 01:08:47,628
You know how
a hydrogen bomb works?

808
01:08:47,628 --> 01:08:50,297
- With... Hydrogen?
- That's funny.

809
01:08:50,297 --> 01:08:53,008
- Boss!
- Other bombs explode, right?

810
01:08:53,634 --> 01:08:56,804
But not the hydrogen bomb
It implodes.

811
01:08:56,804 --> 01:09:01,308
Creating an explosion to the thousandth
millionth degree.

812
01:09:01,308 --> 01:09:03,227
- Do you get it?
- Yeah. Yeah.

813
01:09:03,227 --> 01:09:04,895
- Do you?
- I get it!

814
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:06,939
Let em go!

815
01:09:21,328 --> 01:09:22,830
No!

816
01:09:24,456 --> 01:09:25,207
What are you doing?

817
01:09:26,667 --> 01:09:28,460
Jesus Christ, Teddy. Jesus!

818
01:09:29,670 --> 01:09:30,546
You got Billings?

819
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:34,675
What's the fuck's the matter with you guys?
You catch them, not kill them!

820
01:09:34,675 --> 01:09:35,509
He jumped us.

821
01:09:35,676 --> 01:09:38,971
You, give me a hand with him.
We've got to get him to the infirmary.

822
01:09:39,471 --> 01:09:40,306
Goddamnit!

823
01:09:40,347 --> 01:09:42,683
No, no! Not you, not you.
Take a walk.

824
01:09:43,392 --> 01:09:44,143
Come on!

825
01:09:44,143 --> 01:09:46,312
Paula's gonna have my Goddamn
balls for this..

826
01:10:18,177 --> 01:10:19,220
<i>Laeddis....</i>

827
01:10:40,533 --> 01:10:41,575
<i>Laeddis....</i>

828
01:10:54,505 --> 01:10:55,297
Please...

829
01:10:55,297 --> 01:10:56,799
Oh my God!

830
01:10:58,968 --> 01:11:01,637
<i>Stop me.
Before I kill more.</i>

831
01:11:02,513 --> 01:11:03,764
<i>Laeddis ...</i>

832
01:11:08,018 --> 01:11:08,686
Go!

833
01:11:11,730 --> 01:11:13,441
<i>Please, please!</i>

834
01:11:21,824 --> 01:11:23,826
<i>Laeddis ...</i>

835
01:11:31,041 --> 01:11:33,169
<i>You told me I'd be free of
this place.</i>

836
01:11:34,712 --> 01:11:36,380
<i>You promised.</i>

837
01:11:38,174 --> 01:11:39,675
<i>You lied.</i>

838
01:11:40,009 --> 01:11:40,760
Laeddis?

839
01:11:46,891 --> 01:11:48,225
Laeddis?

840
01:11:50,227 --> 01:11:51,687
That's pretty damned funny.

841
01:11:53,814 --> 01:11:55,274
Your voice...

842
01:11:55,483 --> 01:11:57,151
Don't you recognize it?

843
01:11:57,193 --> 01:11:59,779
After all the talks we had?

844
01:11:59,779 --> 01:12:02,406
After all the lies you've told me?

845
01:12:02,406 --> 01:12:04,366
Let me see your face.

846
01:12:04,575 --> 01:12:07,036
They say I'm theirs now.

847
01:12:07,745 --> 01:12:10,706
They say I'll never leave here.

848
01:12:11,332 --> 01:12:14,126
Your match is about to go out.

849
01:12:16,045 --> 01:12:18,255
Let me see your goddamn face now!

850
01:12:18,255 --> 01:12:19,256
Why?

851
01:12:19,256 --> 01:12:21,759
So you can lie to me more?

852
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:24,178
- This isn't about the truth!
- Yes it is.

853
01:12:24,178 --> 01:12:28,015
- It's about exposing the truth.
- This is about you!

854
01:12:28,015 --> 01:12:29,600
And Laeddis.

855
01:12:30,768 --> 01:12:33,771
That's all it's ever been about.

856
01:12:33,771 --> 01:12:35,481
I was incidental.

857
01:12:36,565 --> 01:12:38,109
A way in.

858
01:12:40,736 --> 01:12:42,071
George?

859
01:12:42,530 --> 01:12:43,948
George Noyce?

860
01:12:44,740 --> 01:12:48,327
No, it's not possible,
You can't be here.

861
01:12:48,411 --> 01:12:49,829
Do you like it?

862
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:53,457
Who did this to you, George?

863
01:12:53,457 --> 01:12:54,834
You did!

864
01:12:55,292 --> 01:12:56,669
What the hell do you mean?

865
01:12:56,669 --> 01:12:58,796
What are you talking
all of your fucking talk

866
01:12:58,796 --> 01:13:01,257
And I'm back here because of you!

867
01:13:01,257 --> 01:13:03,592
George, I how did they get you out of Dedham.
Huh?

868
01:13:03,592 --> 01:13:06,971
However this happened, Im gonna
find a way to fix this. You understand me?

869
01:13:06,971 --> 01:13:08,389
I'll never get out now.

870
01:13:08,389 --> 01:13:11,183
I got out once, But not twice, never twice.

871
01:13:11,183 --> 01:13:14,603
- Tell me how they got you here?
- They knew!

872
01:13:14,687 --> 01:13:15,980
Don't you get it?

873
01:13:16,272 --> 01:13:19,191
Everything you were up to.
Your whole plan.

874
01:13:19,734 --> 01:13:22,194
This is a game. All of this...

875
01:13:22,653 --> 01:13:24,030
is for you.

876
01:13:24,196 --> 01:13:26,282
You're not investigating anything.

877
01:13:26,407 --> 01:13:30,119
You're a fucking rat
in a maze.

878
01:13:30,286 --> 01:13:31,370
George...

879
01:13:31,787 --> 01:13:33,956
Gearge you're wrong.

880
01:13:34,582 --> 01:13:35,916
Really?

881
01:13:36,250 --> 01:13:40,046
Been alone much since
you got here?

882
01:13:40,046 --> 01:13:42,214
I'm been with my partner.

883
01:13:42,256 --> 01:13:45,384
You have never worked
with him before, have you?

884
01:13:46,093 --> 01:13:47,219
He's a...

885
01:13:47,803 --> 01:13:50,097
US Marshal from Seattle.

886
01:13:50,097 --> 01:13:53,267
You have never worked
with him before, have you?

887
01:13:54,477 --> 01:13:55,770
George, look...

888
01:13:55,770 --> 01:13:59,315
I know people.
I trust this man.

889
01:14:03,361 --> 01:14:06,030
Then, they've already won.

890
01:14:08,032 --> 01:14:13,037
Fuck!

891
01:14:13,412 --> 01:14:16,123
They're going to...

892
01:14:16,123 --> 01:14:18,668
take me to the lighthouse.

893
01:14:18,668 --> 01:14:21,337
They're going to
cut into my brain.

894
01:14:21,921 --> 01:14:25,758
And I'm only here because of you!

895
01:14:26,425 --> 01:14:30,429
George, I'm going to get you out of here.
You're not going to the lighthouse.

896
01:14:30,638 --> 01:14:31,389
You're not.

897
01:14:31,514 --> 01:14:34,433
You can't dig out the truth and
kill Laeddis at the same time.

898
01:14:34,475 --> 01:14:37,144
You've got to make a choice.
You understand that, don't you?

899
01:14:37,978 --> 01:14:39,939
I'm not here to kill anyone.

900
01:14:40,064 --> 01:14:44,652
- Liar!
- I not gonna kill him! I swear to you ...

901
01:14:45,111 --> 01:14:47,279
She's dead.

902
01:14:47,613 --> 01:14:50,116
Let her go...

903
01:14:50,324 --> 01:14:51,534
Let her go.

904
01:14:52,660 --> 01:14:53,577
Tell him Teddy...

905
01:14:54,578 --> 01:14:56,998
Tell him why.

906
01:14:58,958 --> 01:15:01,127
You've got to do it.
There's no other way.

907
01:15:01,752 --> 01:15:04,922
- Let her go.
- Tell him about the day you brought me my locket...

908
01:15:05,339 --> 01:15:05,965
You've gotta do it!

909
01:15:06,132 --> 01:15:10,678
How I told you my heart was breaking.
And you asked me why?

910
01:15:10,678 --> 01:15:12,513
She's fucking with your head.

911
01:15:12,513 --> 01:15:15,850
And I told you
it was from happiness.

912
01:15:15,850 --> 01:15:17,351
She'll kill you. She's going to kill you.

913
01:15:20,646 --> 01:15:24,483
You want to uncover the truth?
You've gotta let her go ...

914
01:15:24,734 --> 01:15:28,070
- I can't.
- You have to let her go!

915
01:15:28,070 --> 01:15:30,031
I can't!
I can't.

916
01:15:36,203 --> 01:15:39,624
Then you'll never leave
this island.

917
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:46,255
Dolores?

918
01:15:53,220 --> 01:15:55,848
He's not in this ward.

919
01:15:56,349 --> 01:15:58,309
He was transferred...

920
01:15:58,684 --> 01:16:00,102
Out of here.

921
01:16:01,896 --> 01:16:03,981
If he's not in ward A,

922
01:16:04,607 --> 01:16:07,652
there's only one place he can be

923
01:16:11,989 --> 01:16:13,866
The lighthouse.

924
01:16:21,290 --> 01:16:22,458
Hey!

925
01:16:25,378 --> 01:16:26,754
God help you.

926
01:16:35,471 --> 01:16:38,307
Boss, we got problems.
McPherson and Cawley are in the building.

927
01:16:38,307 --> 01:16:41,143
They heard an orderly went batshit on a patient,

928
01:16:41,143 --> 01:16:43,980
They're looking all over the place for him.
They're on the way to the roof.

929
01:16:43,980 --> 01:16:45,356
Let's get the hell out of here.

930
01:16:45,356 --> 01:16:46,399
This way.

931
01:16:48,442 --> 01:16:51,612
Just keep going.
We belong here

932
01:17:00,871 --> 01:17:04,500
- What happened to you?
- What do you mean?

933
01:17:05,167 --> 01:17:06,919
Where were you?

934
01:17:06,919 --> 01:17:09,213
After we got that guy to the infirmary,

935
01:17:09,213 --> 01:17:11,507
I took a little detour
to patient records.

936
01:17:11,507 --> 01:17:13,134
Did you ever find Laeddis?

937
01:17:14,093 --> 01:17:15,177
No.

938
01:17:15,261 --> 01:17:18,389
- No. I never found him.
- Well I've got the next best thing.

939
01:17:18,389 --> 01:17:19,849
His intake form.

940
01:17:19,849 --> 01:17:22,685
It was the only thing in his file.
No session notes. No incident reports.

941
01:17:22,685 --> 01:17:24,729
No photographs... just this.
It was weird.

942
01:17:24,770 --> 01:17:26,564
Here, take a look.

943
01:17:27,356 --> 01:17:28,733
I'll look at it later.

944
01:17:30,693 --> 01:17:31,903
What's the matter, boss?

945
01:17:32,486 --> 01:17:34,947
I'll take a look at it later,
that's all.

946
01:17:37,241 --> 01:17:38,659
Ashecliffe's that way.

947
01:17:38,743 --> 01:17:40,620
I'm not going to Ashecliffe.

948
01:17:42,038 --> 01:17:43,664
I'm going to the lighthouse.

949
01:17:44,498 --> 01:17:47,376
I'm going to find out what
the fuck is happening on this island.

950
01:18:00,765 --> 01:18:01,974
Here it is.

951
01:18:02,558 --> 01:18:03,768
Damn!

952
01:18:04,852 --> 01:18:06,729
We're too far South.
We're gonna have to double back.

953
01:18:07,271 --> 01:18:09,857
There's no way we could cross those rocks.

954
01:18:09,857 --> 01:18:12,693
There could be a way behind those trees.

955
01:18:12,693 --> 01:18:14,612
Maybe a path that goes around the rocks
that leads over to the lighthouse.

956
01:18:14,654 --> 01:18:17,615
What are we doing here?
We've got the intake form.

957
01:18:17,990 --> 01:18:21,661
It proves there's a 67th patient...
which they've said repeatedly doesn't exist.

958
01:18:24,038 --> 01:18:26,207
I'm getting to that lighthouse.
Do you understand?

959
01:18:28,834 --> 01:18:31,546
What the hell can I say to you
to stop you?

960
01:18:31,879 --> 01:18:32,964
Why would you want to Chuck?
Why?

961
01:18:33,005 --> 01:18:37,593
Because climbing down there
when it's dark is a thin step short to suicide. That's why.

962
01:18:37,593 --> 01:18:38,636
Okay.

963
01:18:38,803 --> 01:18:42,306
Maybe you better sit this one out then.

964
01:18:43,724 --> 01:18:47,478
You brought me into this, boss.
And now I am trapped here on this rock.

965
01:18:47,478 --> 01:18:48,437
On this island.

966
01:18:48,521 --> 01:18:52,400
Without no one to rely on but eachother.
And now you're acting like.........

967
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:53,442
Like what? Like what?

968
01:18:53,484 --> 01:18:55,069
How am I acting?

969
01:18:58,948 --> 01:19:03,286
What the hell happened back there
in those cells, Ted?

970
01:19:08,207 --> 01:19:13,546
- What do you think the weather is like in Portland, Chuck?
- I'm from Seattle.

971
01:19:15,298 --> 01:19:16,799
Seattle?

972
01:19:21,345 --> 01:19:24,265
I'll going on...alone.

973
01:19:25,808 --> 01:19:27,435
I'm going with you, boss.

974
01:19:27,435 --> 01:19:29,103
I said alone.

975
01:19:30,855 --> 01:19:32,565
Fine.

976
01:19:58,090 --> 01:19:59,425
Damn it!

977
01:20:00,510 --> 01:20:01,803
Damn it!

978
01:20:06,891 --> 01:20:10,102
I knew it wouldn't take long.
But I couldn't get to it. The tide was up.

979
01:20:19,570 --> 01:20:20,780
Chuck!

980
01:20:23,241 --> 01:20:24,534
Chuck!

981
01:21:26,471 --> 01:21:27,555
Come on!

982
01:22:02,548 --> 01:22:03,841
Chuck!

983
01:22:04,300 --> 01:22:06,010
Where are you, Chuck?

984
01:22:30,660 --> 01:22:32,078
Chuck!

985
01:22:33,663 --> 01:22:35,206
Chuck!

986
01:23:19,584 --> 01:23:20,960
Who are you?

987
01:23:23,463 --> 01:23:24,881
I'm Teddy Daniels.

988
01:23:24,922 --> 01:23:26,007
I'm a cop.

989
01:23:27,216 --> 01:23:28,426
You're the marshal.

990
01:23:30,344 --> 01:23:31,554
That's right.

991
01:23:33,890 --> 01:23:34,974
Would you mind...

992
01:23:35,058 --> 01:23:37,894
taking your hand from behind
your back, please?

993
01:23:37,894 --> 01:23:38,936
Why?

994
01:23:39,228 --> 01:23:40,855
Why?!

995
01:23:41,397 --> 01:23:44,442
I want to make sure what you're
holding won't hurt me.

996
01:23:51,741 --> 01:23:52,909
I'm gonna keep this...

997
01:23:54,327 --> 01:23:55,703
If you don't mind.

998
01:23:56,954 --> 01:23:58,873
Fine by me.

999
01:24:10,802 --> 01:24:12,011
You're Rachel Solando.

1000
01:24:14,180 --> 01:24:15,640
The real one.

1001
01:24:19,102 --> 01:24:20,978
Did you kill your children?

1002
01:24:22,772 --> 01:24:23,940
I never had children.

1003
01:24:25,692 --> 01:24:26,859
I was never married.

1004
01:24:28,903 --> 01:24:32,532
And before I was a patient
in Ashecliff, I worked here.

1005
01:24:34,534 --> 01:24:35,952
You were a nurse?

1006
01:24:37,662 --> 01:24:39,372
I was a doctor, marshal.

1007
01:24:43,334 --> 01:24:44,585
You think I'm crazy?

1008
01:24:45,086 --> 01:24:47,922
- No, I ...
- And if I say I'm not crazy ...

1009
01:24:48,423 --> 01:24:51,342
well that hardly helps, does it?

1010
01:24:52,593 --> 01:24:56,055
That's the Kafkaesque genius of it.

1011
01:24:59,058 --> 01:25:00,351
People tell the world you're crazy

1012
01:25:01,144 --> 01:25:02,520
and all your protests to the contrary,

1013
01:25:03,021 --> 01:25:04,230
just confirms what they're saying.

1014
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:09,569
I'm not following you.
I'm sorry.

1015
01:25:09,777 --> 01:25:11,195
Once you are declared insane,

1016
01:25:12,071 --> 01:25:14,824
then anything you do is called
a part of that insanity.

1017
01:25:14,824 --> 01:25:17,660
Your reasonable protests
or denial.

1018
01:25:18,661 --> 01:25:20,872
Valid fears,
paranoia.

1019
01:25:20,872 --> 01:25:23,124
Survival instincts.

1020
01:25:23,666 --> 01:25:24,751
Defense mechanisms.

1021
01:25:25,460 --> 01:25:28,212
You're smarter than you look marshal.
That's probably not a good thing.

1022
01:25:29,797 --> 01:25:30,798
Tell me something...

1023
01:25:30,965 --> 01:25:32,175
Yeah...

1024
01:25:34,093 --> 01:25:35,845
What happened to you?

1025
01:25:36,596 --> 01:25:39,432
I started asking about these large
shipments of sodium-anatol

1026
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:43,394
- and opium-based hallucinogens.
- Psychotropic drugs.

1027
01:25:44,854 --> 01:25:46,272
I asked about the surgeries, too.

1028
01:25:49,609 --> 01:25:51,361
Ever heard of trans-orbital lobotomy?

1029
01:25:52,987 --> 01:25:54,697
They zap the patient with electroshocks,

1030
01:25:55,782 --> 01:25:59,827
then go through the eye with an ice pick

1031
01:26:00,787 --> 01:26:02,538
and pull out some nerve fibers.

1032
01:26:05,583 --> 01:26:07,043
Makes the patients much more obedient.

1033
01:26:07,919 --> 01:26:09,963
Tractable.

1034
01:26:10,713 --> 01:26:11,798
It's barbaric.

1035
01:26:13,216 --> 01:26:14,384
Unconscionable.

1036
01:26:15,593 --> 01:26:20,390
Do you know how pain enters the
body marshal? Do you?

1037
01:26:21,140 --> 01:26:22,642
Depends on where you're hurt.

1038
01:26:23,518 --> 01:26:24,936
No, it has nothing to do with the flesh.

1039
01:26:25,186 --> 01:26:26,938
The brain controls pain.

1040
01:26:28,022 --> 01:26:32,277
The brain controls fear, empathy,
sleep, hunger, anger... everything.

1041
01:26:34,821 --> 01:26:35,989
What If you could control it?

1042
01:26:37,156 --> 01:26:38,283
The brain?

1043
01:26:38,324 --> 01:26:39,993
Re-create a man,

1044
01:26:40,785 --> 01:26:42,579
so he doesn't feel pain,

1045
01:26:43,121 --> 01:26:45,331
or love, or sympathy.

1046
01:26:46,916 --> 01:26:51,337
A man who can't be interrogated
because he has no memories to confess.

1047
01:26:53,881 --> 01:26:55,967
You can never take away
all a man's memories.

1048
01:26:56,092 --> 01:26:57,468
Never.

1049
01:26:57,677 --> 01:27:01,222
Marshal, the North Koreans
used American POWs

1050
01:27:01,723 --> 01:27:03,182
during their brainwashing experiments.

1051
01:27:03,474 --> 01:27:06,394
They turned soldiers into traitors.
That's what they are doing here.

1052
01:27:07,145 --> 01:27:11,816
They're creating ghosts to go out in the world.
And do things sane men never do.

1053
01:27:11,816 --> 01:27:14,736
To have that kind of ability, that kind of knowledge.

1054
01:27:15,236 --> 01:27:16,821
That would take years.

1055
01:27:17,030 --> 01:27:20,617
Years of research,
hundreds of patients to experiment on.

1056
01:27:22,577 --> 01:27:24,996
50 years from now,
people will look back

1057
01:27:25,079 --> 01:27:27,832
and say, "Here. This place
is where it all began."

1058
01:27:29,250 --> 01:27:30,376
The Nazis used the Jews.

1059
01:27:30,668 --> 01:27:34,505
The Soviets used prisoners
in their own gulags, and we...

1060
01:27:34,881 --> 01:27:36,299
We tested patients,

1061
01:27:37,091 --> 01:27:38,259
on Shutter Island.

1062
01:27:39,552 --> 01:27:42,805
No, they won't ...
No

1063
01:27:46,017 --> 01:27:47,227
You do understand

1064
01:27:50,939 --> 01:27:53,107
That they can't let you leave?

1065
01:27:53,566 --> 01:27:54,651
I am a federal marshal ...

1066
01:27:55,401 --> 01:27:56,819
They can't stop me.

1067
01:27:58,238 --> 01:27:59,447
I was an esteemed psychiatrist,

1068
01:28:01,574 --> 01:28:04,035
from a respected family.

1069
01:28:04,994 --> 01:28:06,663
It didn't matter.

1070
01:28:09,332 --> 01:28:10,375
Let me ask you ...

1071
01:28:11,084 --> 01:28:12,835
any past traumas in your life?

1072
01:28:14,337 --> 01:28:19,217
Yes. Why? Why would that matter?

1073
01:28:19,509 --> 01:28:21,511
Because they can point to some
event in your past and say

1074
01:28:21,511 --> 01:28:24,097
it is the reason you lost your sanity

1075
01:28:24,430 --> 01:28:26,474
So that when they commit you here

1076
01:28:27,016 --> 01:28:30,937
your friends and colleagues will say,
"Of course he cracked."

1077
01:28:32,772 --> 01:28:34,190
"And who wouldn't have,
after what he'd been through."

1078
01:28:34,190 --> 01:28:35,567
They can say that about anyone

1079
01:28:35,817 --> 01:28:38,945
- anyone at all.
- The point is they're going to say it about you.

1080
01:28:42,615 --> 01:28:44,742
How's your head?

1081
01:28:45,785 --> 01:28:48,538
- My head?
- Any funny dreams lately?

1082
01:28:49,122 --> 01:28:53,459
Trouble sleeping? Headaches?

1083
01:28:54,836 --> 01:28:56,671
I am prone to migraines. Yes.

1084
01:28:56,671 --> 01:28:57,714
Jesus!

1085
01:29:00,425 --> 01:29:02,051
You haven't taken any pills, have you?

1086
01:29:02,886 --> 01:29:05,346
- I mean even aspirin?
- They hit the aspirin?

1087
01:29:05,346 --> 01:29:06,973
Jesus!

1088
01:29:07,182 --> 01:29:10,560
And you ate the food in the cafeteria and drank
coffee they gave you.

1089
01:29:10,894 --> 01:29:13,229
You tell me at least that
you've been smoking your own cigarettes.

1090
01:29:15,815 --> 01:29:18,860
No... no.

1091
01:29:20,195 --> 01:29:21,529
No. I haven't.

1092
01:29:21,779 --> 01:29:24,449
It takes 36 to 48 hours for
neuroleptic narcotics

1093
01:29:24,532 --> 01:29:28,786
to reach workable levels in
the blood stream.

1094
01:29:28,786 --> 01:29:30,705
Palsy comes first

1095
01:29:31,706 --> 01:29:33,875
First the fingertips and then
eventually the whole hand.

1096
01:29:35,877 --> 01:29:40,215
Seen any walking nightmares
lately, marshal? Huh?

1097
01:29:42,634 --> 01:29:44,469
Tell me what goes on in that lighthouse?

1098
01:29:46,221 --> 01:29:47,388
Tell me.

1099
01:29:48,598 --> 01:29:50,642
Brain surgery.

1100
01:29:51,309 --> 01:29:55,313
"Let's open the skull and see
what happens if we pull on this" kind.

1101
01:29:55,772 --> 01:29:58,191
"We learned it from the Nazi's" kind.

1102
01:30:00,902 --> 01:30:02,737
It's where they create the ghosts.

1103
01:30:04,364 --> 01:30:06,407
Who knows about this?

1104
01:30:06,950 --> 01:30:08,827
On the island I mean. Who?

1105
01:30:11,204 --> 01:30:12,622
Everyone.

1106
01:30:12,705 --> 01:30:16,251
Oh come on. The nurses? The orderlies?

1107
01:30:17,168 --> 01:30:19,754
- They couldn't possibly know...
- Everyone.

1108
01:30:38,648 --> 01:30:40,942
You can't stay here.

1109
01:30:41,359 --> 01:30:44,946
They think I'm dead, that I drowned. I'm afraid
if they come looking for you, they might find me.

1110
01:30:45,864 --> 01:30:47,323
I'm sorry, but you have to go.

1111
01:30:54,706 --> 01:30:56,332
I'm gonna come back for you.

1112
01:30:56,499 --> 01:30:59,544
I won't be here. I move during the day.
new places every night.

1113
01:30:59,544 --> 01:31:01,921
But I could come get you
off of this island.

1114
01:31:01,921 --> 01:31:04,174
Haven't you heard a word I've said?

1115
01:31:04,716 --> 01:31:08,178
The only way off the island
is the ferry and they control it.

1116
01:31:08,678 --> 01:31:10,430
You'll never leave here.

1117
01:31:20,356 --> 01:31:21,775
I had a friend.

1118
01:31:22,233 --> 01:31:24,778
I was with him yesterday,
but we got separated.

1119
01:31:25,445 --> 01:31:27,113
Have you seen him?

1120
01:31:28,364 --> 01:31:30,033
Marshal...

1121
01:31:31,409 --> 01:31:33,286
You have no friends.

1122
01:32:05,944 --> 01:32:08,238
There you are.

1123
01:32:10,073 --> 01:32:12,617
We've been wondering when
you'd show up.

1124
01:32:14,452 --> 01:32:15,912
Have a seat.

1125
01:32:16,454 --> 01:32:17,789
Come on.

1126
01:32:28,717 --> 01:32:31,177
Taking a leisurely stroll? Were we?

1127
01:32:32,303 --> 01:32:33,847
I was just...

1128
01:32:34,556 --> 01:32:35,932
just looking around.

1129
01:32:38,601 --> 01:32:40,770
Did you enjoy
God's latest gift?

1130
01:32:42,355 --> 01:32:44,524
- What?
- God's gift.

1131
01:32:46,025 --> 01:32:47,610
The violence.

1132
01:32:52,449 --> 01:32:56,036
When I came downstairs in my home
and I saw that tree in my living room,

1133
01:32:56,953 --> 01:32:59,122
it reached down for me like a divine hand.

1134
01:33:00,707 --> 01:33:02,500
God loves violence.

1135
01:33:05,587 --> 01:33:08,381
- I hadn't noticed.
- Sure you have.

1136
01:33:08,965 --> 01:33:10,800
Why else would there be so much of it?

1137
01:33:11,551 --> 01:33:13,053
It's in us.

1138
01:33:13,219 --> 01:33:14,512
It's what we are.

1139
01:33:16,264 --> 01:33:19,684
We wage war, we burn sacrifices,
we pillage and plunder

1140
01:33:19,684 --> 01:33:21,353
and tear at the flesh
of our brothers

1141
01:33:21,353 --> 01:33:25,482
and why? Because God gave us violence
to wage in his honor.

1142
01:33:28,651 --> 01:33:30,945
I thought God gave us moral order.

1143
01:33:30,945 --> 01:33:33,782
There is no moral order
as pure as this storm.

1144
01:33:34,574 --> 01:33:36,743
There's no moral order at all.

1145
01:33:37,118 --> 01:33:40,914
There's just this:
can my violence conquer yours?

1146
01:33:46,378 --> 01:33:48,338
- I'm not violent.
- Yes you are.

1147
01:33:49,923 --> 01:33:51,883
You're as violent as they come.

1148
01:33:52,926 --> 01:33:55,887
I know this because I'm as violent as they come.

1149
01:33:56,930 --> 01:33:58,848
With the constraints of society,
we are lifted and

1150
01:33:59,099 --> 01:34:04,312
If I was all that stood between you and a meal, you
would crack my skull with a rock and eat my meaty parts.

1151
01:34:06,940 --> 01:34:08,566
Wouldn't you?

1152
01:34:11,277 --> 01:34:15,240
Cawley thinks you're harmless, that you can be
controlled, but I know different.

1153
01:34:16,282 --> 01:34:20,537
- You don't know me.
- Oh but I do. Oh I know you.

1154
01:34:21,413 --> 01:34:23,665
We've known each other for centuries.

1155
01:34:33,508 --> 01:34:36,261
If I was to sink my teeth into your eye
right now,

1156
01:34:36,261 --> 01:34:39,723
would you be able to stop me before I blinded you?

1157
01:34:43,727 --> 01:34:45,395
Give it a try.

1158
01:34:46,855 --> 01:34:51,234
That's the spirit.

1159
01:35:36,112 --> 01:35:37,697
Where have you been?

1160
01:35:38,823 --> 01:35:41,076
Wandering, just looking at your island.

1161
01:35:41,117 --> 01:35:45,580
Oh I forgot. You're leaving.
Now that Rachel has been found.

1162
01:35:45,914 --> 01:35:47,415
Sure. Yeah.

1163
01:35:49,668 --> 01:35:50,961
Big meeting?

1164
01:35:51,544 --> 01:35:54,130
Oh, yes ...

1165
01:35:54,130 --> 01:35:56,800
Apparently there was an unidentified man
in ward C yesterday

1166
01:35:56,800 --> 01:36:00,428
He subdued a highly dangerous patient.
Quite handily.

1167
01:36:01,554 --> 01:36:02,639
Is that so?

1168
01:36:02,722 --> 01:36:07,477
It seems he had a long conversation with a
paranoid schizophrenic, George Noyce.

1169
01:36:10,438 --> 01:36:13,441
This Noyce,
you said his name was,

1170
01:36:14,276 --> 01:36:17,487
- he's delusional?
- Oh extremely. He can be quite upsetting.

1171
01:36:17,487 --> 01:36:20,657
In fact, two weeks ago, a patient
got so wound up

1172
01:36:20,657 --> 01:36:24,744
by one of Noyce's stories
that he beat him up.

1173
01:36:24,911 --> 01:36:26,538
Cigarette?

1174
01:36:27,914 --> 01:36:29,791
Oh. No, thanks.
I quit.

1175
01:36:31,376 --> 01:36:33,545
So, you're taking the ferry?

1176
01:36:34,087 --> 01:36:35,505
Oh yes. Absolutely. I uh...

1177
01:36:36,172 --> 01:36:38,049
I think we've gotten
all we came here for so.

1178
01:36:38,883 --> 01:36:40,093
"We" marshal?

1179
01:36:42,304 --> 01:36:44,097
Speaking of which. Have you

1180
01:36:44,514 --> 01:36:47,017
- seen him, Doctor?
- Who?

1181
01:36:47,851 --> 01:36:49,519
My partner, Chuck.

1182
01:36:52,230 --> 01:36:54,316
You don't have a partner, Marshal.
You came here alone.

1183
01:36:56,818 --> 01:36:59,446
You know, I've built something valuable here.

1184
01:36:59,446 --> 01:37:03,074
And valuable things have a way of
being misunderstood in their own time.

1185
01:37:03,074 --> 01:37:05,118
Everyone wants a quick fix,
they always have.

1186
01:37:05,160 --> 01:37:08,830
I'm trying to do something that people,
yourself included, don't understand.

1187
01:37:08,830 --> 01:37:11,416
And I'm not going to give up
without a fight.

1188
01:37:12,751 --> 01:37:15,420
I can see that...

1189
01:37:19,132 --> 01:37:21,092
So tell me again
about your partner.

1190
01:37:22,969 --> 01:37:24,971
What partner?

1191
01:38:29,953 --> 01:38:31,705
Marshal...

1192
01:38:32,998 --> 01:38:34,499
Going somewhere?

1193
01:38:34,958 --> 01:38:38,753
No. Just heading out
to the ferry. So...

1194
01:38:40,297 --> 01:38:42,007
I'm afraid it's the other way.

1195
01:38:45,010 --> 01:38:46,970
If you wait a moment,

1196
01:38:47,470 --> 01:38:50,557
I'll find someone who can take you
to the dock.

1197
01:38:54,269 --> 01:38:56,855
What is this, doctor?

1198
01:38:56,855 --> 01:38:59,482
It's just a sedative.

1199
01:38:59,482 --> 01:39:02,194
- It's for precaution.
- Precaution?

1200
01:39:04,613 --> 01:39:09,034
What are you going to do?
Kill me? Marshal.

1201
01:39:09,409 --> 01:39:10,785
You think you deserve it?

1202
01:39:11,244 --> 01:39:14,206
For what?
For provoking you?

1203
01:39:14,623 --> 01:39:17,292
and, forgive me,
what doesn't provoke you?

1204
01:39:17,626 --> 01:39:18,835
Remarks...

1205
01:39:19,211 --> 01:39:20,670
- Words...
- Nazis!

1206
01:39:21,505 --> 01:39:23,131
Well that, too.

1207
01:39:23,590 --> 01:39:25,425
And of course, memories, dreams...

1208
01:39:26,593 --> 01:39:30,847
Did you know that the word "trauma" comes
from the Greek for "wound"?

1209
01:39:31,181 --> 01:39:35,477
And what is the German word for "dream"
"Traumen".

1210
01:39:35,477 --> 01:39:36,645
Traumen.

1211
01:39:37,979 --> 01:39:40,899
Wounds can create monsters.

1212
01:39:41,107 --> 01:39:43,819
And you ...
you are wounded, marshal.

1213
01:39:44,736 --> 01:39:47,781
Wouldn't you agree,
when you see a monster

1214
01:39:48,490 --> 01:39:50,033
you must stop it?

1215
01:39:53,078 --> 01:39:55,247
- I agree.
- Yes...

1216
01:40:41,793 --> 01:40:43,628
What are you doing, baby?

1217
01:40:48,884 --> 01:40:50,594
You've got to get to the ferry.

1218
01:40:51,178 --> 01:40:53,472
No. No.
No.

1219
01:40:57,559 --> 01:41:01,646
If the world thinks that Chuck is dead,
then he is perfect for their experiments.

1220
01:41:02,147 --> 01:41:04,816
There's only one place they'd take him.

1221
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:09,946
You go there and you'll die.

1222
01:41:09,946 --> 01:41:14,117
He's my partner. If they are hurting him, if they are
holding him against his will, I've got to bring him out.

1223
01:41:14,326 --> 01:41:16,495
I can't lose anyone else.

1224
01:41:17,079 --> 01:41:21,416
Don't go, Teddy.
Please don't do this. Don't go.

1225
01:41:24,252 --> 01:41:26,296
I'm sorry, honey.

1226
01:41:28,006 --> 01:41:30,801
I love this thing because
you gave it to me

1227
01:41:33,512 --> 01:41:35,597
But the truth is ...

1228
01:41:35,597 --> 01:41:38,767
it's one fucking ugly tie.

1229
01:42:19,099 --> 01:42:20,308
No!

1230
01:43:42,099 --> 01:43:44,059
Don't move!
Stay where you are!

1231
01:43:45,644 --> 01:43:47,396
Are you going to kill me?

1232
01:43:47,729 --> 01:43:52,025
No.
I'm not gonna kill you.

1233
01:45:44,054 --> 01:45:47,057
Why are you all wet, baby?

1234
01:45:48,100 --> 01:45:50,727
- What did you say?
- You know exactly what I said.

1235
01:46:04,074 --> 01:46:06,660
The rifle's empty by the way.

1236
01:46:12,207 --> 01:46:14,167
Have a seat.

1237
01:46:20,841 --> 01:46:24,219
For god's sake dry off
you're going to catch a cold.

1238
01:46:25,220 --> 01:46:26,305
Alright.

1239
01:46:28,974 --> 01:46:31,893
How badly did you hurt the guard?

1240
01:46:34,479 --> 01:46:36,815
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1241
01:46:39,526 --> 01:46:41,236
Yes. He's here.

1242
01:46:41,695 --> 01:46:44,907
Have Dr.Sheehan take a good look
at your man before you send him up.

1243
01:46:46,491 --> 01:46:48,452
So, Dr. Shehan...

1244
01:46:48,994 --> 01:46:50,329
He came on the ferry
this morning, huh?

1245
01:46:51,330 --> 01:46:52,414
Not exactly.

1246
01:46:54,166 --> 01:46:56,835
You blew up my car.
I really loved that car.

1247
01:46:58,128 --> 01:46:59,922
Sorry to hear about that.

1248
01:47:03,342 --> 01:47:05,010
Tremors are getting pretty bad.

1249
01:47:06,345 --> 01:47:07,512
How are the hallucinations?

1250
01:47:08,513 --> 01:47:10,057
Get out of here, Teddy.

1251
01:47:11,225 --> 01:47:13,185
This place is gonna be the end of you.

1252
01:47:16,188 --> 01:47:19,066
- Not bad.
- They'll get worse.

1253
01:47:19,483 --> 01:47:20,609
I know.

1254
01:47:21,485 --> 01:47:22,986
Dr. Solando...

1255
01:47:23,904 --> 01:47:26,448
she told me about neuroleptics.

1256
01:47:26,490 --> 01:47:29,952
Did she now?
And when was this?

1257
01:47:29,952 --> 01:47:35,040
I found the doctor, in a cave out by the cliffs.
But you'll never get to her.

1258
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:36,708
I don't doubt it.

1259
01:47:37,251 --> 01:47:39,169
Considering she's not real.

1260
01:47:40,671 --> 01:47:43,298
But your hallucinations are
more severe than I thought.

1261
01:47:44,716 --> 01:47:46,802
You are not on neuroleptics.

1262
01:47:47,761 --> 01:47:50,180
You are not on anything
as a matter of fact.

1263
01:47:50,180 --> 01:47:52,683
Then what the fuck is this?
Huh, what the fuck is this?

1264
01:47:52,683 --> 01:47:53,767
Withdrawal.

1265
01:47:54,017 --> 01:47:55,352
Withdrawal?

1266
01:47:55,727 --> 01:47:58,647
From what? I haven't even had a Goddamned
drink since I've been on this island.

1267
01:47:58,689 --> 01:48:00,065
Chlorpromazine.

1268
01:48:00,399 --> 01:48:04,319
I'm not a fan of pharmacology
but I have to say in your case ...

1269
01:48:05,112 --> 01:48:07,573
- Clorpro... what?
- Chlorpromazine.

1270
01:48:08,240 --> 01:48:12,995
The same thing we've been
giving you for the past 24 months.

1271
01:48:14,288 --> 01:48:15,664
So for the past two years

1272
01:48:15,789 --> 01:48:19,543
you've had somebody slipping
me drugs in Boston. Is that it?

1273
01:48:19,543 --> 01:48:22,004
Not Boston.
Here.

1274
01:48:22,963 --> 01:48:27,634
You've been here for two years.
A patient of this institution.

1275
01:48:30,220 --> 01:48:34,474
After everything I seen here, doctor,

1276
01:48:34,808 --> 01:48:37,436
you really think you're gonna
convince me I'm crazy, huh?

1277
01:48:37,436 --> 01:48:42,024
Do you know the kind of people I deal with everyday?
I'm a U.S. marshal. For Gods sake.

1278
01:48:42,357 --> 01:48:46,236
You were a U.S. marshal.
Here's a copy of the intake form.

1279
01:48:46,236 --> 01:48:49,698
You broke into ward C for
proof of the 67th patient

1280
01:48:49,698 --> 01:48:52,826
If you'd gotten it to the mainland,
you could have blown the lid off this place.

1281
01:48:53,243 --> 01:48:54,620
- Wait... wait.
- But somehow

1282
01:48:54,661 --> 01:48:56,538
you couldn't find time
to look at it. Well read it now.

1283
01:48:57,706 --> 01:48:58,999
Go ahead.

1284
01:49:02,794 --> 01:49:05,088
The patient is highly intelligent,
highly delusional.

1285
01:49:05,088 --> 01:49:06,673
Decorated army veteran.

1286
01:49:07,174 --> 01:49:09,676
Present for the liberation of Dakau.

1287
01:49:10,594 --> 01:49:12,346
Former U.S. marshal.

1288
01:49:12,513 --> 01:49:13,597
Known proclivity for violence.

1289
01:49:13,680 --> 01:49:15,516
Shows no remorse for his crime
because he denies

1290
01:49:15,516 --> 01:49:19,019
that the crime ever took place.
Highly developed and fantastical

1291
01:49:19,019 --> 01:49:22,439
narratives which preclude facing
the truth of his actions.

1292
01:49:22,439 --> 01:49:23,649
I've had enough of this bullshit.

1293
01:49:23,649 --> 01:49:25,108
Where's my partner, huh?

1294
01:49:25,150 --> 01:49:26,777
Where's Chuck?
Where is he?

1295
01:49:27,611 --> 01:49:29,071
Let's try this another way.

1296
01:49:29,446 --> 01:49:32,157
Your wife's maiden name was
"Chanal". Am I correct?

1297
01:49:32,157 --> 01:49:34,868
- Don't you even talk about her!
- I'm afraid I have to.

1298
01:49:36,537 --> 01:49:39,665
Notice anything these four names have in common?

1299
01:49:40,082 --> 01:49:41,250
Your rule of 4.

1300
01:49:41,750 --> 01:49:44,336
- Andrew, what do you see?
- If you have done anything

1301
01:49:44,336 --> 01:49:48,674
- to my partner, doctor. That is a violation ...
- Focus, Andrew. What do you see?

1302
01:49:49,258 --> 01:49:51,844
The names ...
have the same letters.

1303
01:49:51,844 --> 01:49:54,471
Edward Daniels has exactly the same
13 letters

1304
01:49:54,471 --> 01:49:57,099
as Andrew Laeddis.
The same as Rachel Solando

1305
01:49:57,099 --> 01:49:58,809
and Dolores Chanal.

1306
01:49:58,934 --> 01:50:00,519
- The names are anagrams for each other.

1307
01:50:00,936 --> 01:50:04,189
Your tactics, they're not going to work on me.

1308
01:50:04,189 --> 01:50:06,692
You came here for the truth.
Here it is.

1309
01:50:06,775 --> 01:50:08,527
Your name is Andrew Laeddis.

1310
01:50:08,735 --> 01:50:12,698
The 67th patient at Ashecliffe
is you, Andrew.

1311
01:50:14,199 --> 01:50:15,033
Bullshit.

1312
01:50:15,033 --> 01:50:17,661
You were committed here by
court order 24 months ago.

1313
01:50:17,661 --> 01:50:21,039
Your crime is terrible.
One you can't forgive yourself for.

1314
01:50:21,039 --> 01:50:22,958
So you invented another self.

1315
01:50:27,963 --> 01:50:29,173
Let's get down to the facts.

1316
01:50:29,673 --> 01:50:33,469
You've created a story in which
you're not a murderer, you are hero.

1317
01:50:33,677 --> 01:50:34,595
Still a U.S marshal.

1318
01:50:35,179 --> 01:50:37,264
Only here at Ashecliffe
because of a case

1319
01:50:37,473 --> 01:50:38,891
and you've uncovered a conspiracy

1320
01:50:39,266 --> 01:50:41,852
so that anything we tell you about
who you are, what you've done

1321
01:50:42,394 --> 01:50:44,313
you can dismiss as lies, Andrew.

1322
01:50:44,438 --> 01:50:45,814
My name is Edward Daniels.

1323
01:50:45,939 --> 01:50:49,860
I've been hearing this fantasy
for two years now. I know every detail.

1324
01:50:50,068 --> 01:50:52,696
Patient 67. The storm.
Rachel Solando.

1325
01:50:52,696 --> 01:50:55,324
Your missing partner.
The dreams you have every night.

1326
01:50:55,324 --> 01:50:57,910
You were at Dakau,
But you may not have killed any guards.

1327
01:51:01,914 --> 01:51:05,042
I wish I could let you just
live in your fantasy world.

1328
01:51:05,459 --> 01:51:06,752
I really do.

1329
01:51:07,211 --> 01:51:12,257
But you're violent, trained, dangerous.
You're the most dangerous patient we have.

1330
01:51:12,424 --> 01:51:15,052
You've injured orderlies. Guards.
Other patients.

1331
01:51:15,052 --> 01:51:17,679
Two weeks ago
you attacked George Noyce.

1332
01:51:17,679 --> 01:51:19,264
No, no! I am fucking on to you doctor!

1333
01:51:19,431 --> 01:51:21,391
- You had Noyce beaten.
- Of course I didn't.

1334
01:51:21,517 --> 01:51:23,685
Give me one reason
why I would even touch him.

1335
01:51:23,727 --> 01:51:25,687
Because he called you Laeddis

1336
01:51:25,687 --> 01:51:28,065
and you do anything not to be him.

1337
01:51:29,358 --> 01:51:31,985
I have a transcript of that conversation
you had with Noyce yesterday.

1338
01:51:31,985 --> 01:51:36,532
This is about you and Laeddis.
That's all it's ever been about

1339
01:51:38,534 --> 01:51:41,161
No. No. He is saying that it's about
"me and Laeddis".

1340
01:51:41,161 --> 01:51:43,789
When you've asked him what happened
to his face,

1341
01:51:43,789 --> 01:51:46,250
said, and I quote again,
"You did this".

1342
01:51:46,708 --> 01:51:50,379
- No. He meant it was my fault he...
- You almost killed him.

1343
01:51:52,714 --> 01:51:56,677
The warden and the board of overseers
are determined something be done. It's been decided.

1344
01:51:57,428 --> 01:52:01,640
That unless, we can bring you back
to sanity now, right now,

1345
01:52:02,141 --> 01:52:05,269
permanent measures will be taken to ensure
you can't hurt anyone ever again.

1346
01:52:09,022 --> 01:52:11,400
They'll lobotomize you, Andrew.

1347
01:52:11,400 --> 01:52:12,943
Do you understand?

1348
01:52:16,905 --> 01:52:18,240
Yeah, I understand.

1349
01:52:19,116 --> 01:52:21,160
I understand just fine.

1350
01:52:22,327 --> 01:52:26,415
If... if I don't play along
with your little game here.

1351
01:52:26,415 --> 01:52:29,168
Dr. Naehring is gonna turn me into
one of his ghosts.

1352
01:52:29,168 --> 01:52:30,794
What about my partner?

1353
01:52:31,462 --> 01:52:35,924
You're gonna tell the U.S. marshal's office
that he's a defense mechanism?

1354
01:52:37,843 --> 01:52:39,136
Hello, boss.

1355
01:52:57,279 --> 01:53:00,824
What the fuck is going on here?

1356
01:53:03,869 --> 01:53:05,537
You working for him?

1357
01:53:05,954 --> 01:53:11,335
I'm sorry. There wasn't any other way.
Someone had to stick with you. Keep you safe.

1358
01:53:13,295 --> 01:53:15,255
You've been watching me, huh?

1359
01:53:15,923 --> 01:53:17,883
Watching me every minute.

1360
01:53:19,677 --> 01:53:21,095
Who... who are you?

1361
01:53:21,470 --> 01:53:22,846
Who are you?
Tell me.

1362
01:53:23,347 --> 01:53:25,182
Don't you recognize me, Andrew?

1363
01:53:26,975 --> 01:53:29,687
I've been you primary psychiatrist
for the last two years.

1364
01:53:30,938 --> 01:53:32,439
I am Lester Sheehan.

1365
01:53:38,654 --> 01:53:41,281
And I told you about my wife ...

1366
01:53:41,365 --> 01:53:44,618
- I know.
- I climbed down a cliff to get you.

1367
01:53:44,868 --> 01:53:49,415
I trusted you. I risked everything
to come in here after you. Everything!

1368
01:53:49,415 --> 01:53:50,541
I know, boss.

1369
01:53:50,541 --> 01:53:52,292
We're running out of time here, Andrew,

1370
01:53:53,669 --> 01:53:56,296
I swore before the board of
overseers that I could construct

1371
01:53:56,296 --> 01:53:58,924
the most radical, cutting edge role-play

1372
01:53:58,924 --> 01:54:01,552
ever attempted in psychiatry and
it would bring you back.

1373
01:54:01,552 --> 01:54:04,221
I thought if we let you play this out

1374
01:54:04,888 --> 01:54:08,017
we could get you to see how
untrue, how impossible it is.

1375
01:54:09,351 --> 01:54:11,061
You've had to run of the place for two days.

1376
01:54:11,729 --> 01:54:14,690
Tell me, where are the Nazi experiments?

1377
01:54:15,524 --> 01:54:17,359
The satanic O.R.'s?

1378
01:54:30,539 --> 01:54:32,291
Andrew, listen to me.

1379
01:54:34,668 --> 01:54:36,337
If we fail with you

1380
01:54:37,504 --> 01:54:39,923
then everything we've tried
to do here will be discredited.

1381
01:54:39,923 --> 01:54:41,133
Everything.

1382
01:54:43,510 --> 01:54:45,846
We are on the front line of a war here, old boy.

1383
01:54:47,348 --> 01:54:49,850
And right now, it'll come down to you.

1384
01:54:56,732 --> 01:54:58,901
Don't move! Don't move!

1385
01:54:58,901 --> 01:55:02,154
- Andrew, no!
- My name is Edward Daniels.

1386
01:55:02,988 --> 01:55:05,908
This one is loaded.
I can tell by the weight.

1387
01:55:05,908 --> 01:55:08,077
I see. And that's your firearm marshal?
You're sure?

1388
01:55:08,535 --> 01:55:10,162
My initials are on the side and there's a dent in the
barrel from when Philip Stacks shot at me.

1389
01:55:10,162 --> 01:55:14,500
You're not going to fuck with my mind on this
one Doc

1390
01:55:14,500 --> 01:55:17,711
Then blast away, because that's the
only way you're ever getting off this island.

1391
01:55:24,468 --> 01:55:26,011
Andrew, please don't.

1392
01:55:37,147 --> 01:55:38,232
My gun...

1393
01:55:45,364 --> 01:55:47,032
What have you done to
my Goddamn gun.

1394
01:55:48,075 --> 01:55:49,702
It's a toy, Andrew.

1395
01:55:52,454 --> 01:55:54,123
We're telling you the truth.

1396
01:55:55,582 --> 01:55:59,086
Dolores was insane. Manic-depressive.
Suicidal.

1397
01:55:59,420 --> 01:56:02,673
You drank. Stayed away.
Ignored what everyone had told you.

1398
01:56:02,673 --> 01:56:05,801
You moved to that lake house after
she, purposely,

1399
01:56:05,801 --> 01:56:08,554
set your city apartment on fire

1400
01:56:08,596 --> 01:56:10,389
Andrew! Andrew!
Stop it!

1401
01:56:12,641 --> 01:56:13,726
You're lying...

1402
01:56:14,184 --> 01:56:15,978
Andrew, your children.

1403
01:56:16,812 --> 01:56:18,063
Simon...

1404
01:56:18,981 --> 01:56:21,775
- Henry...
- I didn't have any children.

1405
01:56:21,900 --> 01:56:23,402
Your wife drowned them.

1406
01:56:23,777 --> 01:56:26,447
At the cabin by the lake.

1407
01:56:26,488 --> 01:56:28,741
And here, the little girl,
the one you dream of

1408
01:56:29,325 --> 01:56:30,492
every night.

1409
01:56:31,201 --> 01:56:32,453
I never had a little.

1410
01:56:32,453 --> 01:56:36,582
The one who tells you over and over that
you should have saved her

1411
01:56:36,582 --> 01:56:37,791
Saved them all.

1412
01:56:38,375 --> 01:56:39,585
Your daughter...

1413
01:56:40,044 --> 01:56:43,172
Her name was Rachel. Are you going to deny
that she ever lived?

1414
01:56:44,340 --> 01:56:45,507
Andrew, are you?

1415
01:57:08,822 --> 01:57:10,366
I'm so sorry, baby...

1416
01:57:14,870 --> 01:57:16,872
I told you not to come in here.

1417
01:57:17,414 --> 01:57:18,791
I told you...

1418
01:57:19,625 --> 01:57:22,086
this would be the end of you.

1419
01:57:42,523 --> 01:57:43,440
I'm back.

1420
01:57:44,775 --> 01:57:48,904
We got him just outside of Oklahoma.
Must of stopped ten places

1421
01:57:48,946 --> 01:57:50,948
in between here and Tulsa.
I could sleep for a week.

1422
01:57:55,995 --> 01:57:56,829
Dolores?

1423
01:58:03,919 --> 01:58:05,754
Dolores?

1424
01:58:12,761 --> 01:58:13,721
Dolores?

1425
01:58:28,235 --> 01:58:29,111
Dolores?

1426
01:58:54,428 --> 01:58:55,721
Baby...

1427
01:58:57,890 --> 01:58:59,391
Why are you all wet?

1428
01:59:02,228 --> 01:59:03,771
I missed you.

1429
01:59:10,611 --> 01:59:13,864
I want to go home.

1430
01:59:16,283 --> 01:59:17,159
You are home!

1431
01:59:22,998 --> 01:59:24,083
Where are the kids?

1432
01:59:28,379 --> 01:59:30,881
They're in school.

1433
01:59:34,593 --> 01:59:36,762
It's Saturday, honey.

1434
01:59:37,179 --> 01:59:39,223
School's not in on Saturday.

1435
01:59:42,268 --> 01:59:43,811
My school is.

1436
01:59:57,158 --> 01:59:59,368
Oh my God!

1437
02:00:01,745 --> 02:00:03,164
My God!

1438
02:00:17,636 --> 02:00:19,638
God!

1439
02:00:22,349 --> 02:00:25,978
Oh my God, no!

1440
02:00:28,647 --> 02:00:30,399
Come on!
Come on!

1441
02:00:48,542 --> 02:00:51,128
Please, God, no.

1442
02:00:51,128 --> 02:00:54,965
No!

1443
02:00:55,633 --> 02:00:56,926
No!

1444
02:01:02,556 --> 02:01:03,766
No!

1445
02:01:06,310 --> 02:01:07,311
No!

1446
02:02:11,167 --> 02:02:13,669
Let's put them in the room.

1447
02:02:14,420 --> 02:02:16,922
We'll dry them off...

1448
02:02:17,381 --> 02:02:19,091
We'll change their clothes...

1449
02:02:20,885 --> 02:02:24,388
They'll be our living dolls.

1450
02:02:27,266 --> 02:02:28,934
Tomorrow we can take them on a picnic.

1451
02:02:35,733 --> 02:02:37,401
If you ever loved me, Dolores...

1452
02:02:37,818 --> 02:02:39,695
Please stop talking.

1453
02:02:45,284 --> 02:02:48,037
I love you.

1454
02:02:56,587 --> 02:02:58,339
Set me free!

1455
02:03:03,886 --> 02:03:04,845
Honey...

1456
02:03:06,555 --> 02:03:09,392
We'll give them baths...

1457
02:03:16,732 --> 02:03:18,859
- I love you so much, Dolores.
- And I love you. I love you.

1458
02:03:50,141 --> 02:03:52,560
Andrew...

1459
02:03:54,020 --> 02:03:55,771
Andrew, can you hear me?

1460
02:03:57,565 --> 02:04:00,860
Rachel!
Rachel, Rachel...

1461
02:04:02,820 --> 02:04:03,904
Rachel.

1462
02:04:06,324 --> 02:04:07,992
Rachel who?

1463
02:04:11,704 --> 02:04:12,788
Rachel Laeddis...

1464
02:04:14,415 --> 02:04:15,624
My daughter.

1465
02:04:19,503 --> 02:04:21,172
Why are you here?

1466
02:04:24,592 --> 02:04:26,344
Because I killed my wife.

1467
02:04:26,552 --> 02:04:27,928
and why did you do that?

1468
02:04:32,850 --> 02:04:35,895
Dhe murdered our children.

1469
02:04:37,021 --> 02:04:39,857
And she told me to let her go.

1470
02:04:42,860 --> 02:04:47,365
- Who is Teddy Daniels?
- He doesn't exist.

1471
02:04:48,324 --> 02:04:50,284
Neither does Rachel Solando.
I made them up.

1472
02:04:50,952 --> 02:04:52,787
Why?

1473
02:04:53,537 --> 02:04:56,040
We need to hear you say it.

1474
02:05:01,921 --> 02:05:05,049
After she tried to kill
herself the first time,

1475
02:05:06,509 --> 02:05:07,843
Dolores told me she...

1476
02:05:09,428 --> 02:05:11,180
she had an insect...

1477
02:05:12,807 --> 02:05:14,225
living inside her brain.

1478
02:05:15,851 --> 02:05:16,686
She could feel it...

1479
02:05:19,480 --> 02:05:21,232
clicking across
her skull...

1480
02:05:23,359 --> 02:05:26,070
pulling the wires,
just for fun.

1481
02:05:28,572 --> 02:05:30,866
She told me that.

1482
02:05:31,701 --> 02:05:33,911
She told me but I didn't listen.

1483
02:05:39,292 --> 02:05:41,127
I loved her so much.

1484
02:05:42,461 --> 02:05:43,921
Why did you make them up?

1485
02:05:46,257 --> 02:05:49,760
Because I can't take knowing
that Dolores killed our children.

1486
02:05:57,893 --> 02:06:02,106
I killed them, because
I didn't get her help.

1487
02:06:06,485 --> 02:06:09,697
I killed them...

1488
02:06:13,326 --> 02:06:17,538
Here's my theory, Andrew.
We broke through once before,

1489
02:06:17,538 --> 02:06:20,541
nine months ago,
and then you regressed.

1490
02:06:22,251 --> 02:06:25,671
- I don't remember that.
- I know.

1491
02:06:26,714 --> 02:06:30,051
You reset, Andrew.
Like a tape playing

1492
02:06:30,051 --> 02:06:34,513
over and over on an endless loop.

1493
02:06:34,555 --> 02:06:37,642
I hope that what we've done will be enough
to stop it from ever happening again

1494
02:06:37,642 --> 02:06:40,269
But I need to know ...

1495
02:06:40,269 --> 02:06:42,980
you have accepted reality.

1496
02:06:49,278 --> 02:06:52,531
You came after me, huh, doctor?

1497
02:06:55,368 --> 02:06:58,412
You tried to help me when no one else would.

1498
02:07:10,258 --> 02:07:12,885
My name is Andrew Laeddis...

1499
02:07:19,100 --> 02:07:23,604
And I murdered my wife
in the spring of '52.

1500
02:07:48,170 --> 02:07:50,172
How we doing this morning?

1501
02:07:50,590 --> 02:07:52,258
Good.
And You?

1502
02:07:52,341 --> 02:07:54,552
Can't complain.

1503
02:08:03,311 --> 02:08:05,062
So what's our next move?

1504
02:08:05,771 --> 02:08:07,231
You tell me.

1505
02:08:12,862 --> 02:08:14,614
I've gotta get off this rock,
Chuck.

1506
02:08:17,033 --> 02:08:20,620
Get back to the mainland. Whatever the
hell is going on here. It's bad.

1507
02:08:41,933 --> 02:08:44,227
Don't worry, partner.
They're not gonna catch us.

1508
02:08:51,192 --> 02:08:52,902
That's right. We're too smart for them.

1509
02:08:54,946 --> 02:08:56,197
Yeah, we are.
Aren't we?

1510
02:09:12,922 --> 02:09:15,299
You know this place makes
me wonder.

1511
02:09:16,217 --> 02:09:17,677
Yeah? What's that boss?

1512
02:09:19,178 --> 02:09:20,304
Which would be worse?

1513
02:09:21,889 --> 02:09:23,933
To live as a monster ...

1514
02:09:24,559 --> 02:09:27,019
or to die as a good man.

1515
02:09:35,820 --> 02:09:37,905
Teddy?
