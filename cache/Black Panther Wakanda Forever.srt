daughter of Lumumba,

43

sovereign ruler
of the kingdom of Wakanda.

44
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:58,626
Mr. Chairperson,

45
00:06:59,626 --> 00:07:04,215
I believe I speak for
all the member states here

46
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:07,092
when I say that
I am deeply disappointed

47
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:09,261
in Wakanda's failure

48
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:13,808
to stand by promises to
participate in global efforts

49
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:15,977
to tackle
international challenges,

50
00:07:16,059 --> 00:07:17,561
to share resources,

51
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:19,855
and full cooperation

52
00:07:19,938 --> 00:07:21,398
concerning vibranium.

53
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,710
I now give the floor

54
00:07:40,792 --> 00:07:42,712
to Her Majesty, Queen Ramonda.

55
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:52,679
It has always been our policy

56
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:57,768
to never trade vibranium
under any circumstance.

57
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:02,148
Not because of the dangerous
potential of vibranium,

58
00:08:03,023 --> 00:08:07,820
but because of the dangerous
potential of you.

59
00:08:48,235 --> 00:08:52,114
You perform civility here.

60
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:55,200
But we know what you whisper

61
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:57,577
in your halls of leadership

62
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,540
and in your military facilities.

63
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:07,672
"The King is dead.

64
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:12,426
"The Black Panther is gone.

65
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:17,598

Aneka, where is your spear?

69
00:09:58,513 --> 00:10:00,016
Shuri gave me these to try.

70
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,644
You know, I like them better.

71
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,409
Our foremothers
gave us the spear...

72
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,149
because it is precise,
elegant...

73
00:10:10,817 --> 00:10:11,860
and deadly.

74
00:10:14,821 --> 00:10:17,157

under my watch.

75
00:10:19,075 --> 00:10:20,536
Yes, General.

76
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:22,955
I told you not to bring them.

77
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,960

there was another attack

78
00:10:28,043 --> 00:10:30,546
on one of
our outreach facilities.

79
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:35,301
Proof of the involvement
of a member state

80
00:10:35,383 --> 00:10:39,388
is being uploaded to your
mobile devices as we speak.

81
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:43,392
And as for the identity
of the attackers...

82
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:06,624
Let our gracious
response to this incursion

83
00:11:07,624 --> 00:11:09,125
be an olive branch.

84
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:14,090
Further attempts
on our resources

85
00:11:14,172 --> 00:11:17,468
will be considered
an act of aggression

86
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:21,180
and met with
a much steeper response.

87
00:11:23,014 --> 00:11:25,350
We mourn the loss of our king.

88
00:11:26,351 --> 00:11:28,771
But do not think for a second

89
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:31,148
that Wakanda
has lost her ability

90
00:11:31,231 --> 00:11:33,776
to protect our resources.

91
00:11:34,442 --> 00:11:38,071
We are aware
of the ongoing efforts by some

92
00:11:38,154 --> 00:11:41,325

I thought I had too.

101

We're good.

167
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:09,046
We're good.

168
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,256
Where is the strike team?

169
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,633
It wasn't the Wakandans.
They... They were blue.

170
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:13,800
Everyone is dead...

171
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,429
Shit. What is going on?

172
00:18:17,512 --> 00:18:19,347
We're getting pulled backwards.

173
00:18:20,473 --> 00:18:21,933
Oh, my God.

174
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:28,856
Oh, God! Hang on!

175
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:05,786
<i>Queen Ramonda
of the nation of Wakanda</i>

176
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:07,938
<i>gave an electrifying speech
at the UN yesterday,</i>

177
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:09,480
<i>while members of her military</i>

178
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,232
<i>escorted captive mercenaries</i>

179
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,776
<i>onto the floor of the UN.</i>

180
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,694
<i>A year has passed
since Queen Ramonda</i>

181
00:19:14,777 --> 00:19:16,822
<i>was reinstated
as ruler of Wakanda</i>

182
00:19:16,904 --> 00:19:18,406
<i>after King T'Challa's
sudden death</i>

183
00:19:18,489 --> 00:19:20,450
<i>from an undisclosed illness
last year.</i>

184
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,786
<i>All eyes are on the tiny,
powerful nation,</i>

185
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,456
<i>as it finds itself
increasingly isolated...</i>

186
00:19:27,874 --> 00:19:29,710
Approaching the river border.

187
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:37,718
We are home.

188
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:28,977
<i>Princess.</i>

189
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,104
Just a moment.

190
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,521
I'm in the middle of something.

191
00:20:31,604 --> 00:20:33,231
<i>I understand,
Princess, however...</i>

192
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,025
You're disrupting
my train of thought.

193
00:20:38,444 --> 00:20:39,446
Shuri.

194
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:40,989
Mother.

195
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,216
<i>I was trying to tell you.</i>

196
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,242
<i>The Queen is here.</i>

197
00:20:44,325 --> 00:20:46,452
- Thank you.
- That thing unnerves me.

198
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:47,787
I think that one day

199
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:50,164
artificial intelligence
is going to kill us all.

200
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:53,085
My AI isn't like the movies,
Mother.

201
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:54,877
It does exactly
what I tell it to do.

202
00:20:54,961 --> 00:20:57,547
Yeah, if only children
were the same.

203
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:01,468
Everyone seems to be
working diligently.

204
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:05,681
Yes. Rapid emergency
response task.

205
00:21:06,347 --> 00:21:07,473
There could be any number of

206
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:09,226
unknown threats on the horizon,

207
00:21:09,308 --> 00:21:10,978
and they're creating solutions.

208
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:14,021
Oh, What is this?

209
00:21:14,105 --> 00:21:15,816
Exo Suits for our army.

210
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:18,402
It grants the user
super-human strength,

211
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:20,653
speed, and durability.

212
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:23,156
But, as always, Okoye had notes.

213
00:21:23,239 --> 00:21:24,490
What were her notes?

214
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:25,950
She hates them.

215
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:27,035
Oh.

216
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,666
What about recreating
the Heart-Shaped Herb?

217
00:21:33,749 --> 00:21:35,960
Have you made
any progress on that?

218
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:37,254
<i>Excuse me, Princess.</i>

219
00:21:37,336 --> 00:21:40,548
<i>Nakia, daughter of Yaa,
is trying to reach you again.</i>

220
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:41,633
<i>Maybe you should...</i>

221
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,469
Maybe you should
continue your calculations

222
00:21:43,551 --> 00:21:44,720
as I instructed.

223
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,305
<i>As you wish, Princess.</i>

224
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,348
We do not need the Herb, Mother.

225
00:21:50,808 --> 00:21:52,393
We need new technology.

226
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:53,729
What of the Black Panther?

227
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,611
The mantle has unified
our nation for centuries.

228
00:22:00,693 --> 00:22:02,863
The Black Panther
is a relic, Mother.

229
00:22:02,945 --> 00:22:05,449
I wasn't trying to save
the mantle with the Herb,

230
00:22:05,531 --> 00:22:07,700
I was trying to save my brother.

231
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,162
Oh, Shuri.

232
00:22:24,884 --> 00:22:26,678
Do you know what day it is?

233
00:22:26,761 --> 00:22:27,762
Tuesday.

234
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,556
The date, child.

235
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:38,065
Brother's passing.

236
00:22:38,731 --> 00:22:40,025
One year ago today.

237
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,245
Have you planned anything?

238
00:22:51,327 --> 00:22:55,249
Yes. It involves you taking
your mother for a drive.

239
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,250
- Right now?
- Right now.

240
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,545
And you can leave
your Kimoyo Beads here.

241
00:22:59,627 --> 00:23:00,754
- Mother.
- No, no.

242
00:23:00,836 --> 00:23:02,672
You won't need them
where we are going.

243
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,424
Hmm?

244
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:10,389
And the other two. Yes.

245
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:37,999
You need to sit here with me.
And with yourself.

246
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,669
It is the only way
you are going to heal

247
00:23:40,751 --> 00:23:43,087
from the wound caused
by T'Challa's death.

248
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:44,463
I'm fine, Mother.

249
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:47,843
You don't have to worry
about me.

250
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:52,722
He's gone,
but I'm moving forward.

251
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:54,641
T'Challa is dead,

252
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:57,603
but that doesn't mean
he is gone.

253
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:00,980
When that illness
took your brother from us,

254
00:24:01,147 --> 00:24:05,652
I had to lead a wounded nation
and a broken world.

255
00:24:05,818 --> 00:24:08,529
But I still took time
in the bush.

256
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:11,950
I wandered until I found water.

257
00:24:12,116 --> 00:24:13,492
And I sat.

258
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,787
Then I did this ritual

259
00:24:16,954 --> 00:24:19,333
that I am about to show you now.

260
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:26,131
I found your brother
in the breeze,

261
00:24:27,423 --> 00:24:30,802
pushing me gently, but firm.

262
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,971
Like his hand on my shoulder.

263
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:37,808
It took some time,

264
00:24:39,185 --> 00:24:41,145
but he was there.

265
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:48,778
He wasn't there, Mother.

266
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:52,031
The presence that you felt

267
00:24:52,114 --> 00:24:54,034
was just a construct
of your mind.

268
00:24:56,243 --> 00:24:59,998
Brought on so you could feel
some comfort or joy.

269
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:02,124
That's all.

270
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,877
Hmm.

271
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:11,884
What construct
does your mind create

272
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:14,011
when you think of your brother?

273
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:16,931
Does it offer you comfort?

274
00:25:18,307 --> 00:25:19,684
Or torment?

275
00:25:33,364 --> 00:25:34,449
Come, child.

276
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:47,211
How did you get this?

277
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,505
What does it matter?

278
00:25:49,338 --> 00:25:51,133
What does this have to do
with your ritual?

279
00:25:52,299 --> 00:25:54,635
Burning of the funeral garments

280
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:57,055
marks the end
of the mourning period

281
00:25:57,221 --> 00:26:00,142
and the beginning
of a new relationship

282
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,477
with our loved ones
that have passed on...

283
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,563
I'm not doing this, Mother.

284
00:26:05,896 --> 00:26:07,274
If I sit

285
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:09,985
and think about my brother
for too long,

286
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:14,280
it won't be these clothes
I'll burn.

287
00:26:15,531 --> 00:26:17,075
It will be the world...

288
00:26:18,492 --> 00:26:20,036
and everyone in it.

289
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,372
Shuri...

290
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:29,755
Shuri, there's something
that I need to tell you

291
00:26:30,337 --> 00:26:31,547
about your brother.

292
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:37,095
Mother, wait!

293
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,639
What are you doing?

294
00:27:04,413 --> 00:27:06,333
This better not be
a part of your ritual.

295
00:27:06,415 --> 00:27:07,750
It isn't.

296
00:27:09,376 --> 00:27:11,046
Stop! Right there!

297
00:27:11,712 --> 00:27:14,548
Who are you?
And how did you get in here?

298
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:17,594
This place is amazing.

299
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:20,596
The air is pristine.

300
00:27:22,056 --> 00:27:23,057
And the water...

301
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:26,728
My mother told stories
about a place like this.

302
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:30,231
A protected land with people
that never have to leave.

303
00:27:30,397 --> 00:27:32,733
That never have to change
who they were.

304
00:27:34,318 --> 00:27:35,402
What reason do you have

305
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,279
to reveal your secret
to the world?

306
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:40,325
I am not a woman
who enjoys repeating herself.

307
00:27:40,491 --> 00:27:42,368
Who are you?

308
00:27:42,536 --> 00:27:43,745
I have many names.

309
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:47,457
My people call me K'uk'ulkan...

310
00:27:50,376 --> 00:27:52,086
but my enemies call me Namor.

311
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,423
The American military
detected vibranium

312
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,093
under my nation's domain.

313
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:02,639
I was able to
stop them from minin' it,

314
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:04,850
but we need Wakanda's help

315
00:28:04,932 --> 00:28:06,684
to prevent it
from happenin' again.

316
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:10,771
They use a machine designed
by an American scientist.

317
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:13,441
Vibranium only exists here.

318
00:28:13,607 --> 00:28:14,942
In Wakanda.

319
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,486
Mother, he's covered in it.

320
00:28:20,364 --> 00:28:24,118
Your son exposed the power
of vibranium to the world.

321
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:26,997
In response,
other nations have begun

322
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:28,498
searching the planet for it.

323
00:28:28,664 --> 00:28:32,085
His choice has compromised us.

324
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:35,255
I think Wakanda
could find the scientist

325
00:28:35,337 --> 00:28:36,631
and bring them to me?

326
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:41,385
It is only fair that Wakanda
helps to resolve our dilemma.

327
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:44,014
You do not sneak into my country

328
00:28:44,096 --> 00:28:46,807
and tell me what is fair.

329
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:51,354
I have more soldiers than
this land has blades of grass.

330
00:28:52,146 --> 00:28:54,857
And they have
incomparable strength.

331
00:28:55,357 --> 00:28:58,486
I would hate to come back
under different circumstances.

332
00:29:04,491 --> 00:29:06,952
When you have the scientist,
blow into this,

333
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,454
place it in the ocean.

334
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,915
I'll be there
shortly afterwards.

335
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,670
For your own sake,

336
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:18,088
don't mention anything about me

337
00:29:18,172 --> 00:29:19,966
to anyone outside of Wakanda.

338
00:29:28,682 --> 00:29:30,602
Did you see the wings
on his ankles?

339
00:29:46,992 --> 00:29:48,202
How did he do that?

340
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:50,579
We must convene the Council.

341
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:54,209
Heaven Scrapers had no evidence

342
00:29:54,291 --> 00:29:56,001
of any activity at all.

343
00:29:58,087 --> 00:30:02,925
Oh, the river border
has been breached, huh?

344
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:04,469
If my soldiers were present,

345
00:30:04,885 --> 00:30:07,096
this "fish man"

346
00:30:07,262 --> 00:30:09,098
would be bound before us
as we speak.

347
00:30:09,181 --> 00:30:11,433
If your muscle brains
were present,

348
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:12,893
they would still be there

349
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:14,770
choking on their
fuzzy adornments.

350
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:16,105
You bald-headed demon...

351
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:18,066
Show some respect, you two.

352
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:19,233
Respect?

353
00:30:19,316 --> 00:30:21,819
These men should be
ashamed to show their faces!

354
00:30:21,902 --> 00:30:22,988
Watch your tone, Jabari!

355
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:37,960
As I was saying,

356
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:40,922
there was no aerial
surveillance footage of him.

357
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:42,339
And nothing
on the radar as well.

358
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:45,969
So, he swam underwater
for 100 kilometers.

359
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:47,636
He was not alone.

360
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,015
And claims to command
a massive army.

361
00:30:50,097 --> 00:30:54,393
He wants us to deliver
one American scientist?

362
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:55,519
So he can kill them?

363
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:56,688
Do it.

364
00:30:58,981 --> 00:31:00,775
We never had to face an enemy

365
00:31:00,858 --> 00:31:02,610
with access to vibranium before.

366
00:31:03,569 --> 00:31:05,572
And we have no Black Panther
to protect us.

367
00:31:05,654 --> 00:31:07,281
That is because
this wise Council

368
00:31:07,364 --> 00:31:09,950
allowed Killmonger
to take the throne

369
00:31:10,117 --> 00:31:12,117
and burn up all of your
precious Heart-Shaped Herb.

370
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:14,663
M'Baku,
what would you have us do?

371
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:17,208
We should find the fish man
and kill him.

372
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,962
If we do
What he is asking for now,

373
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,548
what is to stop him
from coming back

374
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:26,425
and asking for more?

375
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:36,894
As you were.

376
00:31:38,604 --> 00:31:42,733
Is it just me, or does this
keep getting uglier?

377
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,068
It's you.

378
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,779
- So, does it work?
- Yes.

379
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:48,364
This thing can detect

380
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:50,658
the altered frequency
of vibranium

381
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:53,952
through water, stones,
even heavy metals.

382
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,829
Whoever built this is brilliant.

383
00:31:56,163 --> 00:31:57,582
Come, look.

384
00:31:58,165 --> 00:32:00,835
Some are custom parts
and others look like

385
00:32:01,001 --> 00:32:02,754
they gathered it
from a junkyard.

386
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,172
I am still struggling to believe

387
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:08,218
that vibranium exists
outside of Wakanda.

388
00:32:08,383 --> 00:32:10,636
Perhaps there was
more than one meteorite.

389
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:12,514
Our planet is covered
of mostly water,

390
00:32:12,596 --> 00:32:13,681
so it's reasonable

391
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,808
that the other one
just landed there.

392
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:18,060
This changes everything
that we know.

393
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:21,689
The Great Mound.
All of the legends and fables.

394
00:32:22,397 --> 00:32:24,275
Those stories
are seared in my mind.

395
00:32:24,441 --> 00:32:26,236
That sounds very painful.

396
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:30,531
So we have to find
this scientist after all.

397
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:33,867
- I do have an idea.
- Mm.

398
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:35,995
I'm going to need the princess.

399
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:38,163
Out of the question.

400
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:40,458
She is in no state
to be in the field.

401
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:45,380
It may
do her some good to get out.

402
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:48,508
It might just be exactly
what she needs.

403
00:32:49,049 --> 00:32:52,010
Besides, I can do
this American operation

404
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:53,179
with my eyes closed.

405
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:56,473
It's not the Americans
that I'm worried about.

406
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,058
This Namor,

407
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:00,478
he snuck past our defenses.

408
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:02,564
That will never happen again.

409
00:33:02,646 --> 00:33:04,231
He was not alone.

410
00:33:04,982 --> 00:33:06,151
She'll be with me.

411
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:08,402
So,

412
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:10,445
when are we leavin'

413
00:33:10,529 --> 00:33:12,699
so I can see
my favorite colonizer?

414
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:24,645
<i>♪ Can't stop ♪</i>

415
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,421
<i>♪ Addicted to the shindig ♪</i>

00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,797
<i>♪ Chop Top, he says I'm gonna win big... ♪</i>

417
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:31,884
Whoa.

418
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:34,136
<i>♪ Distant cousin to the reservation ♪</i>

419
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,890

00:33:36,972 --> 00:33:39,308
<i>♪ This punk, the feeling that you stay for... ♪</i>

421
00:33:41,518 --> 00:33:42,854
Come on.

422
00:33:44,855 --> 00:33:46,316
Yeah, I got it.

423
00:33:47,232 --> 00:33:48,610
I got it.

424
00:33:50,777 --> 00:33:52,113
Will you slow down?

425
00:33:59,077 --> 00:34:00,371
You didn't think to call?

426
00:34:00,537 --> 00:34:01,914
Now, why would I have
your number?

427
00:34:04,499 --> 00:34:05,793
We are looking for the scientist

428
00:34:05,876 --> 00:34:07,670
who built
the vibranium detector.

429
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:09,447
So it was you guys
in the Atlantic?

430
00:34:10,422 --> 00:34:12,091
Come on. Mining ship.

431
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:13,509
Lot of casualties.

432
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:15,220
What happened?

433
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:16,428
Seriously?

434
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:21,308
It was a joint operation.
Us and the SEALS.

435
00:34:21,475 --> 00:34:24,437
Thirty of their top guys,
two of our best officers,

436
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:25,605
friends of mine.

437
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,064
Gone.

438
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:28,274
Just like that.

439
00:34:28,732 --> 00:34:29,734
You throw in the fact

440
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:30,877
that they were tracking
vibranium...

441
00:34:30,901 --> 00:34:33,571
I can assure you Wakanda
had nothing to do with this.

442
00:34:34,488 --> 00:34:35,573
So who was it?

443
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:39,038
God, look, the way that
this is supposed to work

444
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:41,245
is that I give you information
and you reciprocate.

445
00:34:41,328 --> 00:34:43,997
For our own safety,
we cannot tell you.

446
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:46,250
It's imperative that
we get to the scientist

447
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:47,919
before anything else happens.

448
00:34:48,752 --> 00:34:50,504
You owe me, Ross.

449
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:52,172
You owe my brother.

450
00:34:56,009 --> 00:34:57,011
Okay, look.

451
00:34:57,803 --> 00:35:00,055
There are agents who have
been sentenced to death

452
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,308
for less than
I'm about to give you now.

453
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:03,725
And we got a new director.

454
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:05,770
She's watching me like a hawk.

455
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:08,522
We will be very, very careful.

456
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:10,774
Not just careful,
you gotta be fast.

457
00:35:10,857 --> 00:35:12,442
The US needs another machine

458
00:35:12,526 --> 00:35:14,170
and this kid is
the only person in the world

459
00:35:14,194 --> 00:35:15,446
who knows how to build one.

460
00:35:15,529 --> 00:35:16,571
So they're comin' for her.

461
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:17,656
A kid?

462
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,752
- Hey.
- You forgot to Venmo me.

463
00:35:29,835 --> 00:35:33,089
Ah, it slipped my mind.
It's eight hundred, right?

464
00:35:33,171 --> 00:35:34,924
Eight hundred
was yesterday's price.

465
00:35:35,008 --> 00:35:36,174
It's a band today.

466
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:37,968
That's predatory. I...

467
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:40,930
I built the whole robotic hand.

468
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:43,558
You just corrected
the grip algorithm.

469
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:45,100
And what grade did you get?

470
00:35:50,814 --> 00:35:52,567
Thanks.

471
00:35:55,569 --> 00:35:56,797
Is that an iPhone I see?

472
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:57,821
Primitive.

473
00:36:01,366 --> 00:36:03,201
We have located the scientist.

474
00:36:03,285 --> 00:36:05,038
She is
in the American equivalent

475
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,872
of a Wakandan village school.

476
00:36:06,955 --> 00:36:08,165
<i>A school?</i>

477
00:36:08,665 --> 00:36:11,084
<i>Please tell me
it is a professor.</i>

478
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,046
It's a student, Mother.

479
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:14,629
We can't give her to Namor.

480
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:18,134
<i>Bring this student
back to Wakanda.</i>

481
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,040
I've got it from here.

482
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:27,185
Wait. Maybe I should
speak with her.

483
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:28,643
It will be more discreet.

484
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:31,064
I can be discreet.

485
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:35,817
What?

486
00:36:36,234 --> 00:36:37,402
- Nothing.
- Is it the makeup?

487
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:38,488
No.

488
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:39,757
It's the wrong shade, isn't it?

489
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:40,864
It's the right shade.

490
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:42,533
Fenty 440. You look good.

491
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,120
I can blend in as a student.

492
00:36:47,245 --> 00:36:48,247
I can do this.

493
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:53,585
- You get five minutes.
- Yes!

494
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:06,848
Yo!

495
00:37:07,015 --> 00:37:08,100
Riri Williams?

496
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,064
Yo, I don't do drop-bys no more.

497
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:14,267
You gotta go to the website.

498
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:17,609
It's an encrypted file.

499
00:37:17,776 --> 00:37:18,944
I wanted to airdrop it.

500
00:37:19,444 --> 00:37:21,279
You the...

501
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:23,825
Whew.

502
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,493
You're Princess Shuri.

503
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,663
What the hell
are you doing here?

504
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,455
Oh, shit,
am I getting recruited?

505
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,250
No.

506
00:37:33,792 --> 00:37:35,585
I'm here about
the vibranium detector

507
00:37:35,669 --> 00:37:37,171
that you built for the CIA.

508
00:37:38,672 --> 00:37:40,841
I ain't built no detector
for no CIA.

509
00:37:40,924 --> 00:37:42,593
I made that
for my metallurgy class.

510
00:37:42,759 --> 00:37:44,761
- A school project?
- Yeah.

511
00:37:45,138 --> 00:37:46,930
My professor said
I'd never be able to do it.

512
00:37:48,473 --> 00:37:50,600
To be young, gifted,
and Black though, right?

513
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:55,897
Y'all probably don't say that
in Wakanda.

514
00:37:58,192 --> 00:37:59,234
How old are you?

515
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:01,486
Nineteen.

516
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:03,156
Brilliance at a young age

517
00:38:03,238 --> 00:38:05,783
is not always accepted
by the elders.

518
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:08,785
How long did it take you?

519
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,037
Couple months.

520
00:38:10,203 --> 00:38:11,872
- Couple months?
- The hardest part was

521
00:38:11,955 --> 00:38:13,795
finding big enough
mylar sheets to cover the...

522
00:38:15,542 --> 00:38:17,085
Wait, did I piss off Wakanda?

523
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:18,254
Not just us.

524
00:38:18,837 --> 00:38:20,339
This place is no longer safe
for you.

525
00:38:21,131 --> 00:38:23,634
Gather your things
and come with me. Right now.

526
00:38:24,509 --> 00:38:27,513
I got Differential Equations
class in, like, 15 minutes.

527
00:38:30,015 --> 00:38:31,017
Okay.

528
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,310
Okay.

529
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:35,687
You wait right here.

530
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:39,192
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
I'm just gonna...

531
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:40,609
Ooh!

532
00:38:42,652 --> 00:38:44,279
I had it under control.

533
00:38:45,198 --> 00:38:47,700
I said five minutes.
I gave you six.

534
00:38:47,866 --> 00:38:49,535
Get out. Get out of my dorm.

535
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:51,370
Get out!

536
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:52,538
Hey.

537
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:55,540
I'm warning you!
Do not take another step

538
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:56,625
- toward me!
- Oh!

539
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:57,935
See how they teach the children

540
00:38:57,959 --> 00:38:59,252
to treat their guests? Mm!

541
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,258
Oh...

542
00:39:04,341 --> 00:39:05,676
You brought a spear in here?

543
00:39:05,759 --> 00:39:08,136
You brought a spear in here.

544
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:09,971
I like her.

545
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:11,640
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

546
00:39:11,723 --> 00:39:13,284
- Put it down, put it...
- Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

547
00:39:13,308 --> 00:39:14,893
You'll hurt yourself. Come on.

548
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:16,645
It's all right, Princess.

549
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:18,064
Small, small girl.

550
00:39:19,147 --> 00:39:22,067
I am going to give you
two options.

551
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:24,402
You can come to Wakanda,

552
00:39:24,569 --> 00:39:26,863
conscious or unconscious.

553
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:30,408
You need to be conscious
of the way that you look.

554
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:32,537
Walking round here,
all that ash on your head.

555
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:36,499
- Oh, it's funny?
- No, it's not.

556
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:39,042
- Mm-hmm. I told you!
- You look good.

557
00:39:39,209 --> 00:39:40,877
Calm down.
We'll leave, okay?

558
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:42,712
And she can deal

559
00:39:42,796 --> 00:39:45,466
with that merman
with the winged ankles

560
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:48,553
who wants to kill her
all by herself.

561
00:39:48,718 --> 00:39:50,846
- You got this.
- Mm, with your heater.

562
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,370
Come on. Let's go.

563
00:39:53,098 --> 00:39:54,098
What?

564
00:40:01,189 --> 00:40:02,942
What exactly is this place?

565
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:05,771
I fixed a few trucks
for the head of sanitation.

566
00:40:06,444 --> 00:40:10,241
He lets me work out
of this garage in exchange.

567
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:12,326
I just have to grab
my work laptop.

568
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:17,832
Please don't touch anything.

569
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:20,125
You don't have to worry
about that.

570
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:21,710
It may not look like much,

571
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:23,796
but it's my life's work in here.

572
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:24,879
Mm-hmm.

573
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:28,384
So, the design for the machine
is on that laptop?

574
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:29,551
Yeah.

575
00:40:29,634 --> 00:40:32,596
And you just leave it
on a desk in a car garage?

576
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:35,725
I got 2065-byte encryption
on that thing.

577
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:39,020
That's impressive.
Ever locked yourself out?

578
00:40:39,185 --> 00:40:41,105
Took me the whole
semester to get back in.

579
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,316
Had to build a functional
quantum computer

580
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:45,401
just to crack my own encryption.

581
00:40:45,567 --> 00:40:47,944
What is it you're building
here? Is it Stark Tech?

582
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:49,446
I said don't touch anything.

583
00:40:49,529 --> 00:40:51,239
<i>Princess,

585
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:54,243
- Shit.
- Who was that?

586
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,660
My AI.

587
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,747
They are surrounding us.

588
00:41:02,752 --> 00:41:05,379
I thought you said a merman
was after me.

589
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:06,589
That's the feds.

590
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:22,480
Oh, I do not need this shit
right now!

591
00:41:22,562 --> 00:41:24,774
I swear to God,
I was doing so well!

592
00:41:24,939 --> 00:41:27,567
Goin' to class on time.
I must be dumb as hell.

593
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:30,279
Real dumb thinking that
the Princess of Wakanda

594
00:41:30,363 --> 00:41:32,031
is gonna show up at my doorstep

595
00:41:32,113 --> 00:41:33,741
and then shit about to pop off.

596
00:41:33,823 --> 00:41:34,825
I think

597
00:41:34,908 --> 00:41:37,578
that I'm actually gonna take
my chances with this merman,

598
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:41,374
because at least he never
brought the FBI to my garage!

599
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:44,959

607

General,
they've got us surrounded.

608
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,475
Maybe we should just split up.

609
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:01,060
Out of the question.

610
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:02,352
Does this vehicle work?

611
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:04,939
No.

612
00:42:05,939 --> 00:42:09,234
Everything in this lab works.
Including this bike.

613
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:11,236
Don't even think about it.

614
00:42:11,319 --> 00:42:13,406
Besides, there are three of us.

615
00:42:13,571 --> 00:42:16,033
Two of y'all. I'm takin' this.

Whoo!

617
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:18,993
I knew it.

618
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,580
Don't tell me that
you built this in two months.

619
00:42:21,663 --> 00:42:24,709
I spent years
on this. On and off.

620
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:27,669
Nice. Have you flown it yet?

621
00:42:27,837 --> 00:42:28,962
That thing can fly?

622
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:31,006
There's an entire
YouTube channel

623
00:42:31,089 --> 00:42:32,883

624

Let's go!

657
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:49,125
GRIOT.

658
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:51,587
Give me a visual.

00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:01,096

<i>- Yes, General?</i>

664
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,056
...take me to the princess

665
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:05,892
or I will drive my spear
so deep into your CPU,

666
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,352
you will not be able to process

667
00:44:07,435 --> 00:44:09,230

668
00:44:09,395 --> 00:44:10,675
<i>Just one moment, General.</i>

00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:12,191

GRIOT, give me control
of this vehicle right now!

676
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:28,665
<i>I am clearing you a path.</i>

683
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:56,609

00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:10,707
<i>Princess,
there is a surveillance drone</i>

689
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:12,584
<i>- locked onto you.</i>

690

Hang on.

695
00:45:21,801 --> 00:45:22,803
I got it.

696
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:27,473
Come on, Riri.

697
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:30,143
You gotta find
these differential equations.

698
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:32,104
Once the relative velocity
evens out...

699
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:34,147
Riri, I'm not sure
you can reach that drone

700
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:35,232
without an oxygen mask.

701
00:45:37,859 --> 00:45:40,529
<i>Oxygen level is now 55%.</i>

702
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:43,616
Twenty-eight thousand feet.

703
00:45:44,741 --> 00:45:47,328
<i>Oxygen level is now 30%.</i>

704
00:45:50,455 --> 00:45:51,891
Maximum acceleration.
I just need to adjust

705
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:53,459
my Euler angles
and that should...

706
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:55,569
that should drop it
right on the...

707
00:46:01,966 --> 00:46:03,801
<i>Oxygen, 0%.</i>

708
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:09,140
<i>The drone is no longer
tracking you.</i>

709
00:46:10,058 --> 00:46:12,060
<i>Altitude, 500 feet and falling.</i>

710
00:46:12,143 --> 00:46:13,583
<i>Riri! Are you okay?</i>

711
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:15,772
<i>- Riri!</i>
- Yeah.

712
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:20,444
<i>I'm good.</i>

713
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:22,641
- Incoming!
- Get out of the way!

714
00:46:23,821 --> 00:46:24,924
- Shit!
<i>- And no worries.</i>

715
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:26,951
<i>I got a special delivery
for y'all in three,</i>

716
00:46:27,116 --> 00:46:28,535
<i>two, one...</i>

717
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:31,163
Nice one, Riri!

Whoo!

721
00:46:40,421 --> 00:46:41,464
Riri!

722
00:47:08,491 --> 00:47:11,578
What just happened?
Shuri!

723
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,122
Shuri!

724
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:31,473
<i>The Princess's vitals
are stable, General.</i>

725
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:34,225
<i>She should regain
consciousness momentarily.</i>

726
00:48:08,676 --> 00:48:10,763
Take another step closer

727
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:13,056

728
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:15,325
<i>Drop your weapons!</i>

729
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:24,767
Hey, is she blue?

730
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:30,773
Drop your weapon!

731
00:50:44,665 --> 00:50:45,750
Okoye!

732
00:50:47,252 --> 00:50:48,252
Wait!

733
00:50:48,337 --> 00:50:49,712
<i>Activating interpretation.</i>

734
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:51,023
I'm Shuri.

735
00:50:51,047 --> 00:50:52,341
Princess of Wakanda.

736
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,593
I demand that you take me
to Namor.

737
00:50:54,759 --> 00:50:56,845
Do not bring harm to this girl.

738
00:50:59,555 --> 00:51:01,642
<i>Do we take them both alive?</i>

739
00:51:01,933 --> 00:51:04,227
<i>Yes, Attuma.</i>

740
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:21,662
<i>Breathe.</i>

741
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:31,587
Shuri!

742
00:51:50,022 --> 00:51:52,692
Ross, from the Agency.
You got any witnesses?

743
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:55,069
None. But we think
it was the Wakandans.

744
00:51:55,444 --> 00:51:56,446
Excuse me?

745
00:51:56,529 --> 00:51:57,714
Our field office
got a tip from Langley

746
00:51:57,738 --> 00:51:58,739
that they were coming.

747
00:51:58,906 --> 00:52:00,701
Right. Who made that call?

748
00:52:01,743 --> 00:52:03,343
- She did.
- Director de Fontaine.

749
00:52:05,538 --> 00:52:06,915
Director de Fontaine.

750
00:52:06,999 --> 00:52:08,000
Really?

751
00:52:08,082 --> 00:52:09,084
Well...

752
00:52:10,084 --> 00:52:11,962
Uh, Agent thinks
it was the Wakandans.

753
00:52:12,504 --> 00:52:14,006
Yeah, we've been
on every one of them

754
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:15,148
since they took out our ship.

755
00:52:15,172 --> 00:52:16,591
That's why I wanted you here.

756
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:18,759
You're lookin' good.

757
00:52:18,843 --> 00:52:20,428
Oh. Well, I try.

758
00:52:20,595 --> 00:52:22,096
You put that home gym in?

759
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:23,180
Yeah. Last year.

760
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:26,058
Maybe I'll drop by sometime
and jump on your Peloton.

761
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:27,810
Howdy.

762
00:52:27,893 --> 00:52:29,706
- I'm special agent in charge.
- Oh, good for you.

763
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:31,897
You wanna walk me through
the evidence here, or what?

764
00:52:32,064 --> 00:52:34,234
- Yeah. Okay. After you.
- Yeah. Okay.

765
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:35,797
- All right.
- So, what happened here?

766
00:52:36,152 --> 00:52:37,738
Um, we think it was a car crash,

767
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:39,656
but we're having trouble
finding the cars.

768
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:40,842
What do you mean?

769
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:42,217
It was just like this
when you found it?

770
00:52:42,241 --> 00:52:43,927
Yes.
We think someone involved

771
00:52:43,951 --> 00:52:44,953
got rid of the vehicles.

772
00:52:45,037 --> 00:52:46,264
Got rid of them how?

773
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:47,889
They dumped them into the river.

774
00:52:47,913 --> 00:52:49,153
You're kidding me.

775
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:51,752
It's got an MIT sticker on it.

776
00:52:51,917 --> 00:52:54,296
I want that transferred
to the NSA immediately.

777
00:52:54,462 --> 00:52:56,547
Hey, Ross?
You got a full tank of gas?

778
00:52:56,714 --> 00:52:58,383
Can you give me a ride
back to Langley?

779
00:52:58,466 --> 00:53:00,676
It's an eight-hour drive.

780
00:53:00,761 --> 00:53:02,279
Yeah.
We can talk about the case.

781
00:53:02,303 --> 00:53:04,680
Actually, wouldn't mind...

782
00:53:04,765 --> 00:53:06,933
Apologizing to you
for a couple of things I said

783
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:08,060
during our marriage.

784
00:53:11,437 --> 00:53:12,689
They were blue.

785
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:15,567
And they had
superhuman strength.

786
00:53:16,484 --> 00:53:19,321
And they came from the water
on the backs of whales.

787
00:53:20,196 --> 00:53:21,864
I struck down three of them

788
00:53:21,948 --> 00:53:23,428
with blows
that should've killed them,

789
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:25,201
but they rose again.

790
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:28,622
I wish to leave immediately
to retrieve our princess.

791
00:53:40,424 --> 00:53:41,634
Okoye,

792
00:53:42,009 --> 00:53:44,428
you will be
stripped of your rank

793
00:53:44,513 --> 00:53:46,515
as General of Wakanda's armies

794
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:49,558
and your status as Dora Milaje.

795
00:53:57,859 --> 00:53:58,901
You may.

796
00:54:02,863 --> 00:54:04,323
I have given everything.

797
00:54:05,283 --> 00:54:09,078
Let me die saving my country
and that throne.

798
00:54:11,415 --> 00:54:13,207
Allow me to make this right.

799
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:14,584
"Make it right"?

800
00:54:16,210 --> 00:54:19,339
I do not know if my daughter
is alive or dead.

801
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:22,759
Perhaps we are being too hasty.

802
00:54:22,843 --> 00:54:24,176
Mmm.

803
00:54:24,845 --> 00:54:29,223
She raised a spear against
her own husband for Wakanda.

804
00:54:29,390 --> 00:54:31,935
Where is her
treacherous husband now

805
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:36,397
but in a place where she can
visit if she wished? Mine...

806
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:39,567
is with the ancestors.

807
00:54:39,651 --> 00:54:44,448
I am Queen of the most
powerful nation in the world,

808
00:54:44,613 --> 00:54:47,826
and my entire family is gone!

809
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:51,455
Have I not given everything?

810
00:55:00,629 --> 00:55:02,549
On your feet, General.

811
00:55:08,721 --> 00:55:10,931
I stood by you

812
00:55:11,098 --> 00:55:14,727
after Killmonger
took the throne,

813
00:55:14,895 --> 00:55:18,482
and you and the elders
in this room stood by him

814
00:55:18,647 --> 00:55:22,276
while I ran begging
to the Jabari for protection.

815
00:55:23,652 --> 00:55:25,071
And I warned you

816
00:55:25,154 --> 00:55:28,033
about taking my daughter
on this mission,

817
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:30,118
and you lost her.

818
00:55:30,868 --> 00:55:32,370
So, today,

819
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:35,457
I am done.

820
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:24,089
Are you here, GRIOT?

821
00:56:25,422 --> 00:56:26,674
<i>Yes, my Queen.</i>

822
00:56:27,716 --> 00:56:31,096
Were you with Shuri
when she was abducted?

823
00:56:31,263 --> 00:56:32,555
<i>I was.</i>

824
00:56:32,721 --> 00:56:35,475
Are you able to track
her Kimoyo Beads?

825
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:38,060
Ballistics found
slugs all over Cambridge.

826
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:40,230
Those Wakandans really
took a tour of the city.

827
00:56:40,312 --> 00:56:41,314
Hmm.

828
00:56:41,397 --> 00:56:43,197
I can't see how
they figured out who built it.

829
00:56:43,232 --> 00:56:45,651
That information
is highly classified.

830
00:56:48,904 --> 00:56:49,906
What is that?

831
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:51,408
- That's a new ringtone?
- Oh, shit.

832
00:56:52,741 --> 00:56:54,828
Uh, Director, I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to take this.

833
00:56:54,910 --> 00:56:56,120
It's enough with the titles.

834
00:56:56,203 --> 00:56:57,372
Just take it. I don't care.

835
00:56:57,455 --> 00:56:58,665
Hey, honey sweetheart.

836
00:56:58,747 --> 00:57:00,375
Ooh.

837
00:57:00,457 --> 00:57:03,002
Uh, no, I'm...
I'm with my boss. Now.

838
00:57:03,712 --> 00:57:05,087
Actually, she's leaving.

839
00:57:05,254 --> 00:57:06,256
All right.

840
00:57:06,422 --> 00:57:08,883
I'm gonna work from home,
and then have a shower.

841
00:57:16,265 --> 00:57:17,767
Everett Ross.

842
00:57:17,933 --> 00:57:19,060
Queen Ramonda?

843
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:21,187
What are you doing
with Shuri's Kimoyo Beads?

844
00:57:21,270 --> 00:57:23,230
I didn't know they were hers.
All right?

845
00:57:23,314 --> 00:57:25,567
I just found them
at a pretty ugly crime scene.

846
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:27,736
Do you have the student?

847
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:31,573
Shuri was trying to save her
when they were both taken.

848
00:57:32,489 --> 00:57:33,950
What? Taken by who?

849
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:37,578
My agency assumes it was you.

850
00:57:37,662 --> 00:57:39,705
And I'm worried
they might be onto the fact

851
00:57:39,788 --> 00:57:42,042
that I pointed Shuri and Okoye
in the right direction.

852
00:57:42,207 --> 00:57:43,917
Look, if they're in danger,
I wanna help.

853
00:57:44,002 --> 00:57:45,919
But I can't if I don't know
What's going on.

854
00:57:46,087 --> 00:57:48,797
I am afraid there is
a new world power at play.

855
00:57:49,214 --> 00:57:51,176
A country
that's already on our radar?

856
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:52,259
Or you mean someone else?

857
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:54,346
<i>That is all I can say for now.</i>

858
00:57:54,511 --> 00:57:55,513
Please,

859
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:58,600
alert me if your government
decides to act

860
00:57:58,683 --> 00:58:00,267
on their suspicions.

861
00:58:00,352 --> 00:58:01,518
Yeah. Sure.

862
00:58:02,102 --> 00:58:06,107
Uh, look, if there's anything
I can do to help, let me know.

863
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:08,067
I owe Shuri my life.

864
00:58:08,817 --> 00:58:12,738
GRIOT, did Shuri have
her earrings with her?

865
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:15,450
<i>I lost track of them
in the North Atlantic,</i>

866
00:58:15,616 --> 00:58:18,787
<i>but the people who took her
spoke Yucatec Mayan.</i>

867
00:59:07,042 --> 00:59:08,919
- Hmm?
<i>- Oui,</i> Miss Nakia.

868
00:59:19,388 --> 00:59:20,640
Queen Mother.

869
00:59:22,475 --> 00:59:24,768
Everything is a lesson here
for the children.

870
00:59:24,935 --> 00:59:27,939
They painted the walls,
they feed the fish,

871
00:59:28,105 --> 00:59:30,399
and they grow
everything we eat here.

872
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:33,194
I recognize
some of the concepts here.

873
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:35,321
But you are using
different material.

874
00:59:35,488 --> 00:59:38,825
Yes, we use strictly what
we can find here in Haiti.

875
00:59:40,826 --> 00:59:44,163
You were missed
at T'Challa's funeral.

876
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:48,292
Oh...

877
00:59:55,924 --> 00:59:57,134
Queen Mother.

878
00:59:57,301 --> 01:00:00,263
It's been six years
since you left us.

879
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:03,600
I thought you would at least
come back for the ceremony.

880
01:00:06,352 --> 01:00:07,854
I was afraid

881
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:12,524
of how final
the funeral would be.

882
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:15,652
Nakia, daughter of Yaa,

883
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:20,825
wherever you go,
you are still Wakandan,

884
01:00:20,991 --> 01:00:24,620
and you know
death is not the end.

885
01:00:35,756 --> 01:00:37,509
How is everyone at home?

886
01:00:37,674 --> 01:00:40,011
Shuri has been taken.

887
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:41,721
What?

888
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:45,140
You have infiltrated
many nations before.

889
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:48,953
I was a different person then.

890
01:00:48,977 --> 01:00:52,022
I need someone who can find
where she is being held,

891
01:00:52,189 --> 01:00:55,234
and rescue her,
without being seen.

892
01:00:55,609 --> 01:00:58,446
Who on earth would risk war
with Wakanda?

893
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:01,908
Oh, my God.

894
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:03,283
Okay, breathe. Breathe.

895
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:04,828
Oh, don't tell me to breathe.

896
01:01:04,993 --> 01:01:05,995
Where the hell are we?

897
01:01:06,162 --> 01:01:08,288
We're in a cave.
I'm not sure where.

898
01:01:08,372 --> 01:01:09,374
Oh, my God!

899
01:01:09,915 --> 01:01:11,500
What is that?

900
01:01:11,667 --> 01:01:14,419
Glow worms.
Their larva gives off light.

901
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:16,421
Just calm down.

902
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:18,716
Okay, is there, like,
a new Black Panther

903
01:01:18,799 --> 01:01:20,110
that you can call
to come and get us?

904
01:01:20,134 --> 01:01:21,134
No.

905
01:01:21,218 --> 01:01:22,220
Why not?

906
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:24,096
Because it doesn't
work like that anymore.

907
01:01:24,848 --> 01:01:26,431
The Black Panther is gone.

908
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:28,243
So y'all stopped
having Black Panthers

909
01:01:28,267 --> 01:01:29,268
when I get kidnapped?

910
01:01:42,364 --> 01:01:44,533
Do you understand her?

911
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:46,201
Not completely.

912
01:01:48,288 --> 01:01:49,497
Nuh-uh.

913
01:01:49,663 --> 01:01:52,000
That is some supervillain shit
right there.

914
01:01:52,165 --> 01:01:53,500
That's in every movie.

915
01:01:53,667 --> 01:01:54,919
Princess Leia.

916
01:01:55,085 --> 01:01:56,365
Belle from <i>Beauty and the Beast.</i>

917
01:01:56,421 --> 01:01:59,047
That white chick
from <i>Indiana Jones.</i>

918
01:01:59,131 --> 01:02:00,258
It's fine.

919
01:02:00,341 --> 01:02:02,886
You should see what I have
to wear at Warrior Falls.

920
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:12,729
Wait.

921
01:02:12,812 --> 01:02:15,272
You're not leaving me in here,
are you?

922
01:02:15,355 --> 01:02:16,816
I'm coming back.

923
01:02:17,482 --> 01:02:18,692
I'm coming back.

924
01:02:18,859 --> 01:02:20,777
Stay calm.

925
01:04:29,823 --> 01:04:31,451
Princess.

926
01:04:31,616 --> 01:04:32,618
Welcome.

927
01:04:34,578 --> 01:04:37,040
Please, feel free.

928
01:04:44,296 --> 01:04:45,589
This is beautiful.

929
01:04:46,424 --> 01:04:48,176
That was my mother's.

930
01:04:58,227 --> 01:05:00,772
These are all
Mesoamerican artifacts.

931
01:05:02,230 --> 01:05:04,107
Most likely 16th century.

932
01:05:05,317 --> 01:05:07,527
Have you been alive since then?

933
01:05:09,488 --> 01:05:11,031
Your mother was human.

934
01:05:12,491 --> 01:05:13,493
She was.

935
01:05:13,658 --> 01:05:15,870
Then she became something else.

936
01:05:16,037 --> 01:05:18,080
- How?
- "How?"

937
01:05:18,663 --> 01:05:21,125
"How" is never
as important as "why."

938
01:05:32,386 --> 01:05:33,846
<i>My mother and her village</i>

939
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:35,515
<i>were driven from their farms</i>

940
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:39,435
by Spanish conquistadors
who brought the smallpox,

941
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:42,480
a hateful language,
and dogma from another world.

942
01:05:44,272 --> 01:05:45,982
Facing starvation,

943
01:05:46,149 --> 01:05:47,984
war, and disease,

944
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:50,238
my people turned to Chaac...

945
01:05:51,906 --> 01:05:53,783
our god of rain and abundance.

946
01:05:55,993 --> 01:05:58,830
<i>Chaac gave our shaman
a vision...</i>

947
01:05:58,913 --> 01:06:01,582
<i>...a way to save his people.</i>

948
01:06:05,585 --> 01:06:09,966
<i>Chaac led him to a plant
sprouting from a blue rock.</i>

949
01:06:23,437 --> 01:06:25,647
<i>My mother was pregnant with me
at the time,</i>

950
01:06:25,814 --> 01:06:28,067
and she did not want to
ingest the plant

951
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:30,444
for fear
of what it may do to me.

952
01:06:32,613 --> 01:06:34,489
But the Shaman was convincing.

953
01:07:06,355 --> 01:07:08,191
<i>They all fell sick.</i>

954
01:07:09,357 --> 01:07:11,194
<i>And their lives,</i>

955
01:07:11,359 --> 01:07:13,486
<i>their existence there,</i>

956
01:07:13,654 --> 01:07:14,946
<i>ended.</i>

957
01:07:26,834 --> 01:07:29,085
<i>The plant took away
their ability to breathe air</i>

958
01:07:29,252 --> 01:07:33,049
but enabled them
to draw oxygen from the sea.

959
01:07:36,384 --> 01:07:38,136
<i>They settled in the ocean,</i>

960
01:07:38,803 --> 01:07:41,933
away from war and diseases.

961
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:13,256
My mother gave birth to me there

962
01:08:13,546 --> 01:08:16,800
<i>and I became
the firstborn son of Talokan.</i>

963
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:19,344
<i>The plant gave me wings
on my ankles</i>

964
01:08:19,511 --> 01:08:21,930
<i>and ears
that pointed to the clouds.</i>

965
01:08:22,389 --> 01:08:23,640
I was a mutant.

966
01:08:24,558 --> 01:08:27,812
I could swim in the sky
and age slower.

967
01:08:27,978 --> 01:08:30,480
Breathe the air
our ancestors breathed.

968
01:08:31,732 --> 01:08:33,317
<i>As she grew older,</i>

969
01:08:34,652 --> 01:08:38,238
<i>my mother mourned the life
on land that she once knew...</i>

970
01:08:40,157 --> 01:08:41,908
and died with a broken heart.

971
01:08:44,661 --> 01:08:46,288
She made me promise

972
01:08:46,371 --> 01:08:48,624
to bury her
in the soil of her homeland.

973
01:08:53,754 --> 01:08:56,674
Nothing could prepare me
for what I found there.

974
01:09:06,309 --> 01:09:07,309
Huh?

975
01:09:43,011 --> 01:09:45,014
A Spanish man
of faith cursed me.

976
01:09:45,180 --> 01:09:47,058
As he died by my hand,

977
01:09:47,224 --> 01:09:48,267
<i>he called me...</i>

978
01:09:53,688 --> 01:09:55,899
The child without love.

979
01:09:56,442 --> 01:09:57,902
And I took my name from there.

980
01:10:03,282 --> 01:10:04,992
<i>"Namor."</i>

981
01:10:05,158 --> 01:10:07,995
<i>Because I have no love
for the surface world.</i>

982
01:10:09,996 --> 01:10:12,082
Why are you telling me
all of this?

983
01:10:13,501 --> 01:10:16,629
So that you can understand why
I have to kill the scientist.

984
01:10:16,795 --> 01:10:18,380
What if we took her to Wakanda?

985
01:10:19,756 --> 01:10:20,965
Let us go.

986
01:10:21,925 --> 01:10:23,385
I give you my word.

987
01:10:23,551 --> 01:10:25,011
She will remain in my country.

988
01:10:25,220 --> 01:10:26,679
I cannot risk that, Princess.

989
01:10:26,846 --> 01:10:28,474
Then keep me instead.

990
01:10:30,434 --> 01:10:32,060
I'd love to see your nation.

991
01:10:33,395 --> 01:10:36,023
Well, you can't go
down there in that.

992
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:41,528
Hypothermia will grip you
almost instantaneously.

993
01:10:41,694 --> 01:10:43,947
Your blood will become toxic

994
01:10:44,031 --> 01:10:45,448
and the pressure of the ocean

995
01:10:45,532 --> 01:10:47,952
will break every bone
in your body.

996
01:10:51,037 --> 01:10:52,557
Or you can wear a suit.

997
01:10:52,706 --> 01:10:54,457
We have some of them. Come on.

998
01:10:57,545 --> 01:10:58,545
Stay close.

999
01:12:02,902 --> 01:12:04,569
<i>Hey! Namor, wait!</i>

1000
01:12:49,614 --> 01:12:50,741
<i>Whoa!</i>

1001
01:14:08,152 --> 01:14:09,612
<i>Hello.</i>

1002
01:14:38,181 --> 01:14:39,308
<i>It's beautiful.</i>

1003
01:14:41,143 --> 01:14:42,478
<i>It's made of vibranium.</i>

1004
01:14:42,644 --> 01:14:43,645
Yes.

1005
01:14:43,728 --> 01:14:45,313
In the depths of the ocean,

1006
01:14:45,730 --> 01:14:47,983
I brought the sun to my people.

1007
01:14:50,068 --> 01:14:51,194
I know you wished me

1008
01:14:51,278 --> 01:14:53,529
to spare the life
of the scientist.

1009
01:14:53,906 --> 01:14:56,157
But now you see
what I have to protect.

1010
01:15:20,974 --> 01:15:23,059
<i>Nakia, your hunch was correct.</i>

1011
01:15:23,227 --> 01:15:26,229
<i>I have picked up a location
on Shuri's Kimoyo earrings.</i>

1012
01:15:59,595 --> 01:16:02,224
<i>The signal is coming
from an underwater cavern</i>

1013
01:16:02,390 --> 01:16:05,853
<i>approximately 140 meters
below the surface.</i>

1014
01:16:06,478 --> 01:16:08,772
Queen Mother,
I've found her signal.

1015
01:16:08,938 --> 01:16:11,066
It's coming
from an underwater cave.

1016
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:13,068
If she's down there,

1017
01:16:13,152 --> 01:16:14,778
I'm sure
I'll encounter resistance.

1018
01:16:15,737 --> 01:16:17,656
<i>How would you like me
to proceed?</i>

1019
01:16:18,573 --> 01:16:22,952
Retrieve the princess
by any means necessary.

1020
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:26,331
I will attempt
to draw Namor out.

1021
01:17:01,241 --> 01:17:02,910
You are the first person
from the surface

1022
01:17:02,992 --> 01:17:04,495
to come to Talokan.

1023
01:17:05,496 --> 01:17:07,538
Please take this as a token
of our gratitude.

1024
01:17:14,712 --> 01:17:17,299
It was made with the plant
that saved Talokan.

1025
01:17:20,093 --> 01:17:21,469
You are young, Princess.

1026
01:17:22,345 --> 01:17:25,264
When you age as I do,
you realize

1027
01:17:25,431 --> 01:17:28,184
we all lose everyone we love.

1028
01:17:28,352 --> 01:17:29,937
But when I lost my brother,

1029
01:17:30,103 --> 01:17:31,729
it just felt different.

1030
01:17:31,897 --> 01:17:33,564
He suffered in silence.

1031
01:17:34,148 --> 01:17:37,152
When he finally asked me
to help him, I couldn't.

1032
01:17:38,237 --> 01:17:39,947
How does that make sense

1033
01:17:40,906 --> 01:17:44,576
that the ancestors would
give me gifts and skills

1034
01:17:44,742 --> 01:17:47,496
to help me save my brother,
and I couldn't?

1035
01:17:48,996 --> 01:17:49,997
Why?

1036
01:17:52,459 --> 01:17:54,961
I don't have an answer
for that question.

1037
01:17:57,089 --> 01:17:59,633
My ancestors would often say,

1038
01:18:00,008 --> 01:18:03,428
"Only the most broken people
can be great leaders."

1039
01:18:07,181 --> 01:18:09,350
I admire
what you have built here.

1040
01:18:11,644 --> 01:18:14,105
And how you've protected
your people.

1041
01:18:14,898 --> 01:18:17,943
But as princess of Wakanda,

1042
01:18:18,109 --> 01:18:20,571
I will not stand for you
killing that young woman.

1043
01:18:22,281 --> 01:18:25,367
My nation will not rest
until I'm returned.

1044
01:18:26,785 --> 01:18:28,911
I'm not leaving without her.

1045
01:18:29,662 --> 01:18:33,375
We need to find a peaceful way
to resolve this.

1046
01:18:37,045 --> 01:18:38,755
It is no longer
about the scientist.

1047
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:42,466
For centuries,
the surface nations

1048
01:18:42,550 --> 01:18:45,344
have conquered and enslaved
people like us.

1049
01:18:46,013 --> 01:18:47,471
Over resources.

1050
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:51,143
Since the day
I buried my mother,

1051
01:18:51,309 --> 01:18:52,935
I have prepared my people

1052
01:18:53,019 --> 01:18:55,147
for the time
they will come for us.

1053
01:18:55,313 --> 01:18:59,526
And that machine is the sign
that the time is now.

1054
01:19:01,403 --> 01:19:06,742
I need to know if Wakanda
is an ally or an enemy.

1055
01:19:07,158 --> 01:19:09,036
There is no in-between.

1056
01:19:11,162 --> 01:19:14,875
So you plan to wage war
on the entire world,

1057
01:19:15,459 --> 01:19:17,794
and you want Wakanda
to help you?

1058
01:19:18,711 --> 01:19:19,880
That's madness.

1059
01:19:20,046 --> 01:19:23,050
There isn't a nation
that wouldn't plunder Wakanda

1060
01:19:23,133 --> 01:19:24,675
if given a chance.

1061
01:19:26,010 --> 01:19:27,929
If we make an alliance,

1062
01:19:28,095 --> 01:19:30,806
we can protect each other
by striking them first.

1063
01:19:31,349 --> 01:19:35,603
Then, when the threat of these
nations has been eliminated,

1064
01:19:35,770 --> 01:19:38,398
the scientist will be returned
to Wakanda.

1065
01:19:38,814 --> 01:19:41,609
And if Wakanda
does not accept, what then?

1066
01:19:42,693 --> 01:19:44,654
The scientist will die.

1067
01:19:45,656 --> 01:19:48,575
And Wakanda will be
the first nation to fall.

1068
01:19:48,825 --> 01:19:50,368
An attack on my people?

1069
01:19:50,702 --> 01:19:52,161
Yes.

1070
01:19:52,328 --> 01:19:54,706
And I want you to listen to me.

1071
01:19:54,872 --> 01:19:57,834
Wakanda cannot win a war
with Talokan.

1072
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:11,889
I heard you that night,

1073
01:20:11,974 --> 01:20:13,975
with your mother at the river.

1074
01:20:15,268 --> 01:20:18,020
You said you wanted
to burn the world.

1075
01:20:24,193 --> 01:20:25,696
Let us burn it together.

1076
01:20:34,328 --> 01:20:35,556
Queen Ramonda

1077
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:37,249
won't sell us any vibranium.

1078
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,542
And now they abducted
a young woman

1079
01:20:39,626 --> 01:20:40,876
who built the machine.

1080
01:20:41,044 --> 01:20:42,336
Yeah, with all due respect,

1081
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:44,046
Riri Williams is a child prodigy

1082
01:20:44,130 --> 01:20:46,340
who was running circles around
all of her professors.

1083
01:20:46,508 --> 01:20:47,968
The Wakandans
were recruiting her

1084
01:20:48,050 --> 01:20:49,385
as part of their
outreach program.

1085
01:20:49,553 --> 01:20:50,970
Nothing more. And then,

1086
01:20:51,138 --> 01:20:53,514
you guys send in a SWAT team
under cover of night

1087
01:20:53,681 --> 01:20:55,684
to arrest the Crown Princess

1088
01:20:55,767 --> 01:20:57,102
of an international superpower.

1089
01:21:00,272 --> 01:21:01,992
The President wants
to take offensive action

1090
01:21:02,023 --> 01:21:03,066
against Wakanda.

1091
01:21:04,483 --> 01:21:06,361
What type of offensive action?

1092
01:21:07,069 --> 01:21:08,612
Destabilization.

1093
01:21:09,781 --> 01:21:13,117
Well, Special Officer Ross
is our expert.

1094
01:21:13,285 --> 01:21:15,495
So, Ross, what do you think?

1095
01:21:15,661 --> 01:21:17,163
My sources are telling me

1096
01:21:17,246 --> 01:21:18,646
that there's someone else
out there.

1097
01:21:19,374 --> 01:21:21,294
- Another nation?
- Could be. I don't know.

1098
01:21:21,376 --> 01:21:22,437
You've gotta give me enough time

1099
01:21:22,461 --> 01:21:23,603
to investigate this properly,

1100
01:21:23,627 --> 01:21:25,755
otherwise we're gonna
find ourselves at war

1101
01:21:25,921 --> 01:21:27,758
with a country
whose military capacity

1102
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:29,800
we can't even comprehend.

1103
01:21:31,385 --> 01:21:32,386
Director?

1104
01:21:32,845 --> 01:21:35,098
I think he's the expert.

1105
01:21:35,181 --> 01:21:38,184
I think it would be a mistake
to attack Wakanda.

1106
01:21:44,983 --> 01:21:45,983
<i>Yes?</i>

1107
01:21:46,068 --> 01:21:47,068
We have a problem.

1108
01:22:08,631 --> 01:22:10,966
Is my daughter alive?

1109
01:22:11,134 --> 01:22:13,094
The princess is alive and well.

1110
01:22:13,804 --> 01:22:16,639
She requested
to be taken to Talokan.

1111
01:22:16,806 --> 01:22:19,184
She will remain there
for the time being.

1112
01:22:22,813 --> 01:22:26,066
What can I offer you
in exchange?

1113
01:22:26,483 --> 01:22:27,483
Nothing.

1114
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:29,653
I beg to differ.

1115
01:22:29,819 --> 01:22:33,489
The Americans are preparing
to blame Wakanda

1116
01:22:33,572 --> 01:22:36,117
for your attack
on their mining ship.

1117
01:22:36,283 --> 01:22:39,246
Return my daughter
and the scientist

1118
01:22:39,411 --> 01:22:42,999
or I will inform them
of your existence.

1119
01:22:49,714 --> 01:22:51,841
If you tell the Americans
about us,

1120
01:22:53,343 --> 01:22:55,511
if you try to find us,

1121
01:22:56,595 --> 01:23:00,392
or if I discover a single
Wakandan ship in the ocean,

1122
01:23:01,184 --> 01:23:02,644
I will kill the princess.

1123
01:23:04,187 --> 01:23:05,980
I will come to Wakanda

1124
01:23:06,148 --> 01:23:08,108
and I will kill you.

1125
01:23:17,450 --> 01:23:18,492
So, what happened?

1126
01:23:20,370 --> 01:23:23,372
He wants to go to war
with the surface world,

1127
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:25,332
and asked me to help him.

1128
01:23:29,837 --> 01:23:31,255
I need to think.

1129
01:23:32,131 --> 01:23:34,091
We ain't never
gettin' out of here.

1130
01:23:43,143 --> 01:23:44,144
Ey!

1131
01:24:07,541 --> 01:24:08,542
Shuri...

1132
01:24:15,675 --> 01:24:16,800
Are you okay?

1133
01:24:17,594 --> 01:24:18,969
Are you okay?

1134
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:20,500
- Give me your Beads!
- Let's go.

1135
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:22,014
Give me your Beads.
I can save her.

1136
01:24:22,098 --> 01:24:23,099
We have to go.

1137
01:24:23,265 --> 01:24:24,451
Shuri, I don't know
who this lady is,

1138
01:24:24,475 --> 01:24:25,635
but we need to listen to her.

1139
01:24:25,727 --> 01:24:27,038
Listen, I hit her
with a sonic round.

1140
01:24:27,062 --> 01:24:29,313
It is lethal from this distance.
There is no chance.

1141
01:24:29,397 --> 01:24:31,273
You don't understand.
This will mean war.

1142
01:24:31,441 --> 01:24:33,777
- We have to go.
- Wait!

1143
01:25:17,403 --> 01:25:18,404
Did they hurt you?

1144
01:25:18,487 --> 01:25:20,114
No. No.

1145
01:25:21,657 --> 01:25:22,867
Thank you.

1146
01:25:26,371 --> 01:25:27,639
- GRIOT.
<i>- Yes, my Queen.</i>

1147
01:25:27,663 --> 01:25:29,707
Return us to Wakanda at once.

1148
01:28:26,634 --> 01:28:29,053
Princess,
it is good to have you back.

1149
01:28:29,595 --> 01:28:31,389
The city has been on edge
since you left.

1150
01:28:32,306 --> 01:28:33,308
Go.

1151
01:28:33,474 --> 01:28:36,059
Fortify the sonic barriers
for all waterways.

1152
01:28:36,227 --> 01:28:37,228
Princess?

1153
01:28:38,145 --> 01:28:39,147
Neka.

1154
01:28:41,107 --> 01:28:43,484
Thank the ancestors. Hmm?

1155
01:28:43,818 --> 01:28:47,029
I just wanted to return these.

1156
01:28:48,238 --> 01:28:50,407
No. Keep them.

1157
01:28:50,575 --> 01:28:52,076
Might need them soon.

1158
01:28:52,993 --> 01:28:54,996
Did you get that
from down there?

1159
01:28:57,956 --> 01:29:01,336
Is it true you saw
an underwater empire?

1160
01:29:02,586 --> 01:29:04,339
- Yes.
- Hmm.

1161
01:29:05,005 --> 01:29:06,590
It is beautiful.

1162
01:29:07,841 --> 01:29:10,469
But these people
are dangerous, Aneka.

1163
01:29:10,969 --> 01:29:12,013
Mm.

1164
01:29:30,657 --> 01:29:33,451
So, Miss Riri Williams,

1165
01:29:34,202 --> 01:29:36,371
what do you think of Wakanda?

1166
01:29:36,537 --> 01:29:38,540
The stories just don't do
this place justice.

1167
01:29:41,667 --> 01:29:42,710
It's great.

1168
01:29:42,876 --> 01:29:44,629
But I really
would like to go home.

1169
01:29:46,089 --> 01:29:47,674
You will need to be patient.

1170
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:49,884
Can I at least call my mom?

1171
01:29:56,306 --> 01:29:57,785
The Princess
has been brought home

1172
01:29:57,809 --> 01:29:59,602
by the War Dog Nakia.

1173
01:29:59,769 --> 01:30:01,144
Glory to Hanuman.

1174
01:30:01,228 --> 01:30:02,688
Glory to Hanuman.

1175
01:30:02,772 --> 01:30:07,318
Mm. The spy saves Wakanda
once again.

1176
01:30:07,902 --> 01:30:09,362
The Queen will reward her

1177
01:30:09,528 --> 01:30:12,031
with lifetime banishment.
I'm sure of it.

1178
01:30:14,492 --> 01:30:15,952
Okoye.

1179
01:30:21,582 --> 01:30:23,182
<i>After Thanos' attack,</i>

1180
01:30:23,292 --> 01:30:25,420
when you left
without saying a word,

1181
01:30:26,045 --> 01:30:27,212
it hurt.

1182
01:30:31,175 --> 01:30:34,595
I regret not being there
with all of you.

1183
01:30:36,096 --> 01:30:37,389
It was not easy.

1184
01:30:38,181 --> 01:30:39,183
He was...

1185
01:30:39,850 --> 01:30:43,688
King and Black Panther
to everyone.

1186
01:30:44,354 --> 01:30:46,523
But to me...

1187
01:30:52,279 --> 01:30:53,989
He was everything.

1188
01:30:55,867 --> 01:30:57,827
My T'Challa.

1189
01:30:59,161 --> 01:31:02,122
When he was taken away
from me, just like that, I...

1190
01:31:02,874 --> 01:31:04,751
I had to step away

1191
01:31:05,667 --> 01:31:07,295
and let myself break.

1192
01:31:09,964 --> 01:31:11,174
I couldn't just...

1193
01:31:12,133 --> 01:31:15,510
keep going as if nothing
had happened, you know.

1194
01:31:16,345 --> 01:31:18,305
Mm-hmm.

1195
01:31:33,321 --> 01:31:34,322
We are under attack.

1196
01:31:42,205 --> 01:31:43,288
Here.

1197
01:31:51,964 --> 01:31:53,691
Are you okay?
Are you all right?

1198
01:31:53,715 --> 01:31:55,593
GRIOT, activate the <i>Sun bird.</i>

1199
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:56,928
Shuri, where are you?

1200
01:31:57,094 --> 01:31:58,554
Making my way
to the city right now.

1201
01:31:58,720 --> 01:32:00,180
Stand down! That is an order!

1202
01:32:00,348 --> 01:32:02,642
Mother, I'm with Aneka.
We can provide air support.

1203
01:32:02,809 --> 01:32:04,244
<i>Aneka,
do not let her leave the lab.</i>

1204
01:32:04,268 --> 01:32:05,411
Mother, you're...
you're breaking up.

1205
01:32:05,435 --> 01:32:06,496
- We can't hear you.
<i>- Shuri!</i>

1206
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:07,522
Love you. Bye!

1207
01:32:09,857 --> 01:32:11,057
You just hung up on the Queen.

1208
01:32:11,108 --> 01:32:12,109
I just hung up on my mom.

1209
01:32:12,276 --> 01:32:13,861
There's a difference.
Come. Let's go!

1210
01:32:46,102 --> 01:32:48,187
Invaders!

1211
01:32:53,776 --> 01:32:56,987
Mama! Mama!

1212
01:33:05,412 --> 01:33:06,472
<i>EMTs are suffering</i>

1213
01:33:06,496 --> 01:33:08,291
<i>a form of sonic hypnosis.</i>

1214
01:33:12,295 --> 01:33:14,130
<i>General, plug your ears.</i>

1215
01:33:14,296 --> 01:33:15,380
Yes, my Queen.

1216
01:34:01,803 --> 01:34:03,929
- Can I help?
- Come, quickly.

1217
01:34:14,523 --> 01:34:15,667
Cross your arms...

1218
01:34:21,363 --> 01:34:22,364
Nakia.

1219
01:34:36,754 --> 01:34:38,046
The fish man.

1220
01:35:13,165 --> 01:35:14,166
<i>Phambili!</i>

1221
01:36:26,404 --> 01:36:27,507
Shit, he's too fast.

1222
01:36:27,531 --> 01:36:28,731
He's even faster in the water.

1223
01:36:54,433 --> 01:36:55,994
- Activating system override.
- No.

1224
01:36:56,018 --> 01:36:57,079
Wait! I'll fix it.

1225
01:36:57,103 --> 01:36:59,023
Can't leave you here, Shuri!

1226
01:37:15,496 --> 01:37:16,496
Do you see her?

1227
01:37:16,580 --> 01:37:17,956
Yes. Right there.

1228
01:37:31,469 --> 01:37:33,139
Go, child.

1229
01:37:33,930 --> 01:37:35,474
Wait, what?
And leave you here?

1230
01:37:35,558 --> 01:37:36,559
Run!

1231
01:37:51,239 --> 01:37:52,700
Okoye, move now!

1232
01:39:00,434 --> 01:39:01,519
She did this.

1233
01:39:05,563 --> 01:39:06,732
In one week's time,

1234
01:39:06,816 --> 01:39:09,484
I will return
with my entire army

1235
01:39:09,652 --> 01:39:12,904
and you will join us
against the surface world,

1236
01:39:13,072 --> 01:39:16,032
or I will wash Wakanda
from the face of the Earth.

1237
01:39:18,993 --> 01:39:19,995
Mother.

1238
01:39:20,453 --> 01:39:22,163
- Keep her back!
- Mother!

1239
01:39:22,497 --> 01:39:25,209
- Mama! Mama!
- Bury your dead.

1240
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:27,502
Mourn your losses.

1241
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:32,424
You are queen now.

1242
01:39:32,675 --> 01:39:33,675
Mother!

1243
01:39:34,385 --> 01:39:35,385
No!

1244
01:39:38,555 --> 01:39:40,099
Get off of me! Mother!

1245
01:39:40,849 --> 01:39:42,725
Mama!

1246
01:39:49,567 --> 01:39:51,609
Mama!

1247
01:39:51,693 --> 01:39:53,112
Mama!

1248
01:39:53,696 --> 01:39:54,863
Mother!

1249
01:40:02,412 --> 01:40:03,746
Help me!

1250
01:40:03,913 --> 01:40:05,206
Mama!

1251
01:40:12,715 --> 01:40:14,841
Mama!

1252
01:40:55,549 --> 01:41:00,720
Jabari land offers you
their comfort for your loss.

1253
01:41:07,353 --> 01:41:09,020
You must mourn her

1254
01:41:09,188 --> 01:41:13,108
in accordance to the rituals
of your ancestors.

1255
01:41:15,068 --> 01:41:16,903
Do not bury yourself
in your technology.

1256
01:41:17,071 --> 01:41:18,322
Why are you here?

1257
01:41:20,198 --> 01:41:21,908
I promised your brother

1258
01:41:22,076 --> 01:41:24,370
that I would provide you
with counsel

1259
01:41:24,536 --> 01:41:25,955
and protection.

1260
01:41:28,415 --> 01:41:30,626
But I am in need
of your advice today.

1261
01:41:34,462 --> 01:41:36,215
Your tribal elders
have approached me

1262
01:41:36,297 --> 01:41:38,091
with a proposition.

1263
01:41:39,510 --> 01:41:42,763
They wish to evacuate the city
and set up camp

1264
01:41:42,929 --> 01:41:44,430
in Jabari land.

1265
01:41:44,598 --> 01:41:47,768
So, now you are keen
to hear from a child

1266
01:41:48,434 --> 01:41:50,103
who scoffs at tradition?

1267
01:41:51,104 --> 01:41:52,147
Mm.

1268
01:41:54,316 --> 01:41:55,317
The world...

1269
01:41:57,236 --> 01:41:59,904
The world has taken
too much from you

1270
01:42:00,656 --> 01:42:03,908
for you to still be
considered a child.

1271
01:42:07,036 --> 01:42:08,956
It is in my people's interest
to know

1272
01:42:09,038 --> 01:42:11,500
which way your mind is leaning.

1273
01:42:13,376 --> 01:42:15,086
The elders are desperate.

1274
01:42:16,714 --> 01:42:18,631
The city is vulnerable.

1275
01:42:20,843 --> 01:42:23,011
If you are to provide for them,

1276
01:42:24,138 --> 01:42:26,389
they will be
in great debt to you.

1277
01:42:28,474 --> 01:42:30,184
And what of your heart?

1278
01:42:31,312 --> 01:42:32,313
Hmm?

1279
01:42:33,730 --> 01:42:35,733
Which way is your heart leaning?

1280
01:42:37,608 --> 01:42:40,571
I just buried the last person
who truly knew me.

1281
01:42:44,073 --> 01:42:45,742
My heart was buried with her.

1282
01:43:21,862 --> 01:43:23,738
Oh, man.

1283
01:43:24,614 --> 01:43:26,532
Yeah, your olive oil's
about to go bad.

1284
01:43:26,700 --> 01:43:27,843
What... What are you doing here?

1285
01:43:27,867 --> 01:43:30,536
I'm hungry. And...

1286
01:43:30,953 --> 01:43:32,956
<i>Tragedy strikes
the international community.</i>

1287
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:34,207
<i>Sources can now confirm</i>

1288
01:43:34,291 --> 01:43:37,251
<i>that Queen Ramonda,
daughter of Lumumba, has died.</i>

1289
01:43:37,877 --> 01:43:39,462
<i>Western allies say
that civil conflict</i>

1290
01:43:39,545 --> 01:43:41,590
<i>was the likely cause
of the Queen's...</i>

1291
01:43:44,134 --> 01:43:45,135
So...

1292
01:43:45,510 --> 01:43:46,844
You have any comment?

1293
01:43:49,014 --> 01:43:52,184
I wonder what else your
friends are keeping from you.

1294
01:43:52,393 --> 01:43:54,019
What are you talking about?

1295
01:43:54,185 --> 01:43:57,688
I have no unsanctioned contact
with the kingdom of Wakanda.

1296
01:44:00,108 --> 01:44:02,277
What about the Beads?

1297
01:44:02,568 --> 01:44:04,571
What?

1298
01:44:04,737 --> 01:44:05,738
The Beads.

1299
01:44:05,906 --> 01:44:07,032
I had them bugged

1300
01:44:07,198 --> 01:44:08,867
before you ever even got there.

1301
01:44:09,033 --> 01:44:12,871
I've been privy to every
conversation you've had,

1302
01:44:12,955 --> 01:44:15,624
including that treasonous call
with the Queen.

1303
01:44:15,791 --> 01:44:17,166
May she rest in peace.

1304
01:44:17,584 --> 01:44:18,876
But it's good.

1305
01:44:19,044 --> 01:44:20,086
Well, for us.

1306
01:44:20,254 --> 01:44:22,965
All right. You know what?
The Wakandans saved my life.

1307
01:44:23,465 --> 01:44:25,091
- They're a good people.
- Mm-hmm.

1308
01:44:25,175 --> 01:44:27,219
You ever thought for a second

1309
01:44:27,385 --> 01:44:29,011
what they could be doing?

1310
01:44:29,179 --> 01:44:30,596
Ever thought
what we would be doing

1311
01:44:30,680 --> 01:44:33,892
if the US was the only country
in the world with vibranium?

1312
01:44:34,143 --> 01:44:38,438
Oh, I actually dream about that.

1313
01:44:41,274 --> 01:44:42,943
Val. Val, please.

1314
01:44:43,318 --> 01:44:44,944
It's Director de Fontaine.

1315
01:44:47,822 --> 01:44:50,992
Your mother protected me
like I was one of her own.

1316
01:44:52,286 --> 01:44:54,746
The least that I could do
is try to return the favor.

1317
01:44:57,081 --> 01:44:59,460
We need to find a way
to weaken Namor.

1318
01:44:59,626 --> 01:45:01,795
Even weakened,
he's still gonna be a problem.

1319
01:45:01,961 --> 01:45:05,381
The Black Panther has never
failed to protect Wakanda.

1320
01:45:06,133 --> 01:45:08,135
I thought
the Black Panther was gone.

1321
01:45:17,853 --> 01:45:19,188
My brother is dead.

1322
01:45:20,938 --> 01:45:23,524
But it doesn't mean
the Black Panther is gone.

1323
01:45:41,292 --> 01:45:42,836
GRIOT?

1324
01:45:43,002 --> 01:45:45,630
Let's start by running
a comparative analysis

1325
01:45:45,796 --> 01:45:47,590
between our attempts at creating

1326
01:45:47,674 --> 01:45:49,384
a synthetic Heart-Shaped Herb...

1327
01:45:52,094 --> 01:45:54,055
and the fibers
from this bracelet.

1328
01:45:54,639 --> 01:45:55,933
<i>Yes, Princess.</i>

1329
01:45:59,228 --> 01:46:01,979
Since this was grown
from vibranium-rich soil,

1330
01:46:03,232 --> 01:46:05,483
they may share
some base-level similarities

1331
01:46:05,567 --> 01:46:06,693
that we can exploit.

1332
01:46:06,859 --> 01:46:08,153
<i>As you wish, Princess.</i>

1333
01:46:12,448 --> 01:46:14,867
Please upload
my brother's DNA also.

01:46:15,035 --> 01:46:16,161

Why doesn't he look like them?

1342
01:46:49,236 --> 01:46:51,446
His physiology
is completely different.

1343
01:46:51,612 --> 01:46:54,282
None of them fly
or have pointed ears like him.

1344
01:46:54,782 --> 01:46:55,843
The women that were guarding us,

1345
01:46:55,867 --> 01:46:56,928
they had water over their mouths

1346
01:46:56,952 --> 01:46:58,661
and on their necks.

1347
01:46:58,745 --> 01:46:59,746
He didn't have that.

1348
01:46:59,912 --> 01:47:02,331
Several organisms
don't need gills

1349
01:47:02,416 --> 01:47:05,335
to extract oxygen
from the water, so...

1350
01:47:05,501 --> 01:47:07,045
It's like a jellyfish.

1351
01:47:07,211 --> 01:47:11,008
He just absorbs the oxygen
from his skin.

1352
01:47:12,341 --> 01:47:13,343
It's a process called

1353
01:47:13,426 --> 01:47:14,635

Every day that passes
without selecting the ruler

1362
01:47:41,912 --> 01:47:43,290
is a day wasted.

1363
01:47:43,456 --> 01:47:45,041
We must deal with Namor

1364
01:47:45,125 --> 01:47:46,876
before he brings
his warriors back here.

1365
01:47:47,044 --> 01:47:49,712
And how are we to deal with
a man with that much power?

1366
01:47:50,589 --> 01:47:52,389
In that attack,
before he took out your plane,

1367
01:47:52,465 --> 01:47:53,716
he jumped back into the water.

1368
01:47:53,884 --> 01:47:55,635
What if that's what
makes him strong?

1369
01:47:55,801 --> 01:47:57,720
He's breathing air
and getting oxygen

1370
01:47:57,804 --> 01:47:59,348
from the water on his skin.

1371
01:47:59,514 --> 01:48:01,558
If we could find a way
to dry his ass out,

1372
01:48:01,642 --> 01:48:02,768
he won't be as strong.

1373
01:48:03,100 --> 01:48:04,353
Yo, that's it.

1374
01:48:04,435 --> 01:48:07,648
GRIOT. We need to convert
the Royal Talon Fighter

1375
01:48:07,730 --> 01:48:09,273
into a pervaporation chamber.

1376
01:48:09,441 --> 01:48:10,524
Is that even possible?

1377
01:48:10,692 --> 01:48:11,859
Yes.

1378
01:48:13,362 --> 01:48:15,279
You're going to help us
trap him.

1379
01:48:16,113 --> 01:48:18,116
Please show Miss Williams
Where she's working.

1380
01:48:18,282 --> 01:48:19,826
Right this way.

1381
01:48:23,663 --> 01:48:24,665
<i>How old were you</i>

1382
01:48:24,747 --> 01:48:26,166
<i>when you built
your first machine?</i>

1383
01:48:26,332 --> 01:48:27,416
<i>Three.</i>

1384
01:48:27,584 --> 01:48:31,045
<i>My stepdad was a car mechanic.
He wanted to build airplanes. But...</i>

1385
01:48:31,212 --> 01:48:33,674
<i>He gave me these tools
and let me just work it out.</i>

1386
01:48:37,594 --> 01:48:39,888
<i>So who taught you
how to do all that you do?</i>

1387
01:48:40,221 --> 01:48:41,473
<i>My big brother.</i>

1388
01:48:44,518 --> 01:48:47,853
I was the tip of
the spear of Wakanda's army.

1389
01:48:48,020 --> 01:48:50,439
This is not me.

1390
01:48:50,941 --> 01:48:53,109
Besides, I'm a civilian now.

1391
01:48:54,193 --> 01:48:55,569
I turned in my weapon.

1392
01:48:56,196 --> 01:48:57,863
I built you a new spear as well.

1393
01:48:59,741 --> 01:49:00,742
A new one?

1394
01:49:00,908 --> 01:49:01,952
Yes.

1395
01:49:03,286 --> 01:49:05,663
What is this contraption's
name anyway?

1396
01:49:05,831 --> 01:49:07,290
The Midnight Angel.

1397
01:49:07,456 --> 01:49:08,916
Midnight Angel?

1398
01:49:11,836 --> 01:49:14,046
This will even
the odds against them.

1399
01:49:14,214 --> 01:49:16,675
Sister, I need you to
be ready when I call you.

1400
01:49:18,510 --> 01:49:19,719

How many of these did you make?

1406
01:49:32,691 --> 01:49:34,651
I looked for you
at the Jabari outpost.

1407

01:50:28,996 --> 01:50:30,456
what's the confidence rate?

1425
01:50:31,081 --> 01:50:33,376
<i>98.7%, Princess.</i>

1426
01:50:33,751 --> 01:50:36,420
<i>Would you like me to print
the Heart-Shaped Herb?</i>

1427
01:50:43,719 --> 01:50:46,014
Thought
you'd be back in Haiti by now.

1428
01:50:47,139 --> 01:50:48,683
I'm still Wakandan, you know.

1429
01:50:52,728 --> 01:50:53,729
So...

1430
01:50:55,023 --> 01:50:57,983
this is what you've been up to.

1431
01:50:58,777 --> 01:50:59,944
Yes.

1432
01:51:00,111 --> 01:51:02,029
What you have here, now,

1433
01:51:03,281 --> 01:51:07,493
is a chance to restore
Wakanda's protector.

1434
01:51:07,577 --> 01:51:12,999
It would be the greatest gift

1435
01:51:13,457 --> 01:51:15,794
since Bashenga's discovery.

1436
01:51:20,924 --> 01:51:23,175
We'll soon find out. Come.

1437
01:51:26,304 --> 01:51:27,764
- GRIOT?
<i>- Yes, Princess.</i>

1438
01:51:27,848 --> 01:51:28,931
Print it.

1439
01:51:33,103 --> 01:51:34,813
How will we know if it works?

1440
01:51:35,604 --> 01:51:36,857
If it glows.

1441
01:51:51,912 --> 01:51:53,057
I mean, shouldn't we be

1442
01:51:53,081 --> 01:51:54,374
burning incense or something?

1443
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:56,084
Only Bast knows

1444
01:51:56,166 --> 01:51:58,169
how the ancestors
will make it to this lab.

1445
01:52:08,513 --> 01:52:10,348
Are you sure you don't want me
to bury you?

1446
01:52:10,514 --> 01:52:11,515
No.

1447
01:52:12,099 --> 01:52:14,144
Need you to have access
to my chest,

1448
01:52:14,310 --> 01:52:16,353
just in case
I go through cardiac arrest.

1449
01:52:16,938 --> 01:52:18,480
"Cardiac arrest"?

1450
01:52:19,566 --> 01:52:20,608
She's joking,

1451
01:52:21,151 --> 01:52:22,402
right?

1452
01:52:23,569 --> 01:52:25,404
Right?

1453
01:52:30,367 --> 01:52:34,205
Allow this Heart-Shaped Herb

1454
01:52:34,581 --> 01:52:37,626
to give you the strength
of the Black Panther

1455
01:52:38,042 --> 01:52:40,461
and take you
to the Ancestral Plane.

1456
01:53:59,749 --> 01:54:00,750

1457
01:54:14,096 --> 01:54:15,348
N'Jadaka.

1458
01:54:15,931 --> 01:54:17,099
Lil' cousin.

1459
01:54:17,474 --> 01:54:18,475
How?

1460
01:54:18,559 --> 01:54:21,395
How is never as important
as why, right?

1461
01:54:23,188 --> 01:54:24,441
You chose me.

1462
01:54:24,607 --> 01:54:27,484
Impossible.
I would never choose you.

1463
01:54:27,652 --> 01:54:29,319
Why did you take the Herb?

1464
01:54:30,321 --> 01:54:32,282
- To see my family.
- No, that's bullshit.

1465
01:54:33,241 --> 01:54:35,160
You didn't believe
the Ancestral Plane was real,

1466
01:54:35,242 --> 01:54:36,243
did you?

1467
01:54:39,371 --> 01:54:40,372
No.

1468
01:54:41,124 --> 01:54:42,375
So, Why did you take it, then?

1469
01:54:44,085 --> 01:54:45,461
You don't have to lie to me.

1470
01:54:46,295 --> 01:54:47,796
So I can be strong.

1471
01:54:48,172 --> 01:54:49,674
Strong to do what?

1472
01:54:52,551 --> 01:54:53,553
See?

1473
01:54:55,095 --> 01:54:57,056
We're more alike than you think.

1474
01:54:58,974 --> 01:55:00,934
I took it to avenge
my ancestors too.

1475
01:55:01,102 --> 01:55:02,269
I'm nothing like you.

1476
01:55:03,729 --> 01:55:05,482
You took it for yourself,

1477
01:55:05,648 --> 01:55:07,192
then destroyed the rest.

1478
01:55:08,693 --> 01:55:09,903
Unworthy king,

1479
01:55:10,737 --> 01:55:12,237
afraid of being replaced.

1480
01:55:13,322 --> 01:55:14,323
Just a coward.

1481
01:55:14,491 --> 01:55:15,492
No.

1482
01:55:15,575 --> 01:55:16,617
I had the courage to do

1483
01:55:16,701 --> 01:55:18,243
what was necessary
to change Wakanda.

1484
01:55:19,661 --> 01:55:21,163
How many people
like your scientist

1485
01:55:21,246 --> 01:55:23,625
did Wakanda protect
before I took the throne?

1486
01:55:24,666 --> 01:55:25,667
Cowards.

1487
01:55:25,835 --> 01:55:28,087
That was the Panthers
that came before me,

1488
01:55:29,171 --> 01:55:30,172
and before T'Challa.

1489
01:55:30,255 --> 01:55:32,091
Don't mention my brother.

1490
01:55:32,425 --> 01:55:34,094
You're the reason why he's dead.

1491
01:55:34,594 --> 01:55:37,846
You burnt the Herb,
left us with no protector.

1492
01:55:38,014 --> 01:55:40,265
Then Namor struck
and killed my mother.

1493
01:55:40,433 --> 01:55:42,268
Their blood is on your hands.

1494
01:55:43,435 --> 01:55:44,770
That ain't on me.

1495
01:55:45,313 --> 01:55:46,688
And don't you dare

1496
01:55:46,855 --> 01:55:48,691
take that away from your mother.

1497
01:55:48,858 --> 01:55:50,443
She sacrificed her life
to protect

1498
01:55:50,527 --> 01:55:52,362
a young girl
from the lost tribe.

1499
01:55:53,737 --> 01:55:56,407
Your father, he was a hypocrite.

1500
01:55:57,908 --> 01:55:59,661
He would've killed that girl.

1501
01:56:00,370 --> 01:56:02,287
Shit, he killed his own brother.

1502
01:56:03,872 --> 01:56:06,542
T'Challa was too noble.

1503
01:56:08,711 --> 01:56:11,046
He let the man
who murdered your father live.

1504
01:56:13,174 --> 01:56:14,843
And here you stand.

1505
01:56:20,514 --> 01:56:22,642
Are you gonna be noble
like your brother

1506
01:56:22,809 --> 01:56:24,894
or take care of business...

1507
01:56:25,603 --> 01:56:26,728
like me?

1508
01:56:29,566 --> 01:56:30,567
Are you okay?

1509
01:56:36,447 --> 01:56:37,607
Who did you see?

1510
01:56:43,036 --> 01:56:44,037
No one.

1511
01:56:48,917 --> 01:56:50,336
I failed.

1512
01:56:50,502 --> 01:56:52,630
- It didn't work.
- Hey, Shuri.

1513
01:56:55,758 --> 01:56:58,135
- They abandoned me.
- They would never do that.

1514
01:56:58,219 --> 01:56:59,761
I did everything
I was supposed to do.

1515
01:56:59,845 --> 01:57:01,680
- I re-created the Herb.
- Okay.

1516
01:57:01,764 --> 01:57:03,808
I just did your stupid ritual,
and for what?

1517
01:57:03,974 --> 01:57:05,518
- Relax.
- Why didn't they come for me?

1518
01:57:05,602 --> 01:57:06,728
Just relax.

1519
01:57:13,818 --> 01:57:15,111
Shit.

1520
01:57:19,448 --> 01:57:20,782
Can I get some of that too?

1521
01:57:28,207 --> 01:57:29,250
I think...

1522
01:57:30,792 --> 01:57:32,252
you're going to need a suit.

1523
01:58:03,867 --> 01:58:05,929
There are more
people coming from the city.

1524
01:58:05,953 --> 01:58:07,580
They need more space.

1525
01:58:07,746 --> 01:58:08,747
So what?

1526
01:58:09,624 --> 01:58:11,876
You are visitors.

1527
01:58:12,042 --> 01:58:15,255
It is a wonder how anything
gets done with you people.

1528
01:58:40,404 --> 01:58:42,698
The princess!

1529
01:59:16,232 --> 01:59:17,524
She has done it!

1530
01:59:18,233 --> 01:59:21,237
The Black Panther lives!

1531
01:59:39,087 --> 01:59:41,506
Namor believes
Wakanda is on her knees.

1532
01:59:43,968 --> 01:59:45,428
Our Queen murdered.

1533
01:59:47,929 --> 01:59:49,474
Our capital destroyed.

1534
01:59:51,142 --> 01:59:52,977
He believes
we have no protector.

1535
01:59:54,978 --> 01:59:55,979
But now...

1536
01:59:57,773 --> 01:59:59,776
now is our time to strike.

1537
01:59:59,942 --> 02:00:03,528
How, when we don't
even know how to find him?

1538
02:00:04,112 --> 02:00:05,822
We'll bring Namor to us.

1539
02:00:05,989 --> 02:00:07,532
- Here, again?
- No.

1540
02:00:07,700 --> 02:00:10,036
A distant location at sea.

1541
02:00:10,202 --> 02:00:11,621
All right.

1542
02:00:11,703 --> 02:00:13,163
Let's say this does work.

1543
02:00:14,456 --> 02:00:17,210
Hmm. Assuming
we can kill this man

1544
02:00:17,376 --> 02:00:20,420
who can fly and is potentially
as strong as the Hulk...

1545
02:00:23,174 --> 02:00:25,593
is murdering him
the right solution?

1546
02:00:26,051 --> 02:00:28,011
You were calling for his head

1547
02:00:28,179 --> 02:00:30,514
when his only crime
was intimidation.

1548
02:00:30,680 --> 02:00:32,474
What has changed, Lord M'Baku?

1549
02:00:32,642 --> 02:00:33,850
His soldiers

1550
02:00:34,018 --> 02:00:35,728
did not call him
General or King.

1551
02:00:35,812 --> 02:00:38,480
They called him K'uk'ulkan.

1552
02:00:38,648 --> 02:00:39,857
What is that?

1553
02:00:40,023 --> 02:00:42,151
The feather serpent god.

1554
02:00:42,734 --> 02:00:43,736
What?

1555
02:00:43,819 --> 02:00:45,859
Do you think because we are
living in the mountains,

1556
02:00:45,987 --> 02:00:47,864
we do not have access to books?

1557
02:00:48,116 --> 02:00:49,617
Elders,

1558
02:00:50,033 --> 02:00:51,411
with your permission,

1559
02:00:51,577 --> 02:00:55,288
I would like to talk
with Lord M'Baku alone.

1560
02:01:05,425 --> 02:01:06,759
Namor's not finished.

1561
02:01:08,176 --> 02:01:11,264
He promised to destroy
the surface world.

1562
02:01:11,430 --> 02:01:13,765
Now is our opportunity
to take him.

1563
02:01:13,933 --> 02:01:16,184
- What are you afraid of?
- War.

1564
02:01:16,602 --> 02:01:19,938
If Namor is indeed
a god to his people,

1565
02:01:20,105 --> 02:01:22,733
killing him
will risk eternal war.

1566
02:01:22,817 --> 02:01:23,984
And so what?

1567
02:01:24,527 --> 02:01:26,862
Was my mother's life
not worth eternal war?

1568
02:01:27,028 --> 02:01:28,406
Of course it was.

1569
02:01:29,407 --> 02:01:33,493
Of course she was.

1570
02:01:35,496 --> 02:01:38,707
But it is not what she would
have wanted for you.

1571
02:01:39,959 --> 02:01:40,960
Hmm?

1572
02:01:44,171 --> 02:01:45,881
And it is not what I want...

1573
02:01:48,509 --> 02:01:50,260
for my people.

1574
02:02:00,604 --> 02:02:03,648
You speak of my mother
as if she's still here.

1575
02:02:04,567 --> 02:02:06,568
Of what she would've
wanted for me.

1576
02:02:07,653 --> 02:02:09,947
Her hopes and her dreams.

1577
02:02:13,117 --> 02:02:14,618
But she's dead.

1578
02:02:15,661 --> 02:02:16,661
She's gone!

1579
02:02:18,371 --> 02:02:22,251
Namor drowned her,
right in front of me!

1580
02:02:23,669 --> 02:02:24,961
So, her dreams,

1581
02:02:25,129 --> 02:02:28,215
her goals, her hopes for me...

1582
02:02:31,551 --> 02:02:32,803
it doesn't exist.

1583
02:02:35,514 --> 02:02:37,058
It doesn't matter anymore.

1584
02:02:39,143 --> 02:02:42,020
What matters is what I want,

1585
02:02:42,188 --> 02:02:44,898
and what I want is Namor dead!

1586
02:02:48,903 --> 02:02:50,571
And you're going
to help me get it.

1587
02:03:06,836 --> 02:03:08,464
We leave in the morning.

1588
02:03:34,282 --> 02:03:35,282
Hi.

1589
02:03:35,448 --> 02:03:36,450
Good morning.

1590
02:03:39,077 --> 02:03:40,287
If we survive this,

1591
02:03:41,956 --> 02:03:45,166
I want you to know you have
a home with me in Haiti.

1592
02:03:48,004 --> 02:03:50,339
Here. Take my hands.

1593
02:03:59,014 --> 02:04:01,517
Shuri, I want you
to be honest with me.

1594
02:04:01,684 --> 02:04:04,728
Who did you see
when you took the Herb?

1595
02:04:09,899 --> 02:04:11,611
If you go to war for vengeance,

1596
02:04:11,693 --> 02:04:14,196
it will not fill the hole
left from her loss.

1597
02:04:14,779 --> 02:04:16,657
It will only grow larger,

1598
02:04:16,823 --> 02:04:18,283
and it will consume you.

1599
02:04:20,536 --> 02:04:21,911
It already has.

1600
02:05:51,292 --> 02:05:52,586
For the Queen.

1601
02:06:26,077 --> 02:06:27,496
<i>Phambili!</i>

1602
02:07:06,660 --> 02:07:08,540
<i>Riri, how's it going up there?</i>

1603
02:07:08,912 --> 02:07:10,163
<i>Hey, Mr. GRIOT.</i>

1604
02:07:10,246 --> 02:07:11,846
I could really use
that backup right now.

1605
02:07:11,874 --> 02:07:13,834
<i>I thought you'd never ask.</i>

1606
02:07:19,631 --> 02:07:20,633
<i>Shit.</i>

1607
02:07:25,094 --> 02:07:26,471
<i>Shit, he's fast.</i>

1608
02:07:27,139 --> 02:07:28,349
<i>But I'm faster.</i>

1609
02:07:33,978 --> 02:07:35,563
Whoo!

1610
02:07:48,327 --> 02:07:49,370
<i>I got you.</i>

1611
02:07:55,709 --> 02:07:57,044
<i>It's on you now, Shuri.</i>

1612
02:08:06,219 --> 02:08:07,595
- Princess.
<i>- No.</i>

1613
02:08:08,096 --> 02:08:11,599
I am the Black Panther,
and I'm here for retribution!

1614
02:08:12,268 --> 02:08:15,270
<i>Pervaporation cells activated.</i>

1615
02:08:24,697 --> 02:08:25,697
What's wrong?

1616
02:08:26,447 --> 02:08:27,741
You need a glass of water?

1617
02:08:31,745 --> 02:08:33,455
- Yo, we got him.
- Good!

1618
02:08:33,538 --> 02:08:34,831
Namor has been captured.

1619
02:08:40,962 --> 02:08:42,464
Back to Wakanda!

1620
02:08:48,178 --> 02:08:49,179
Move out!

1621
02:09:14,246 --> 02:09:16,165
What is going on?

1622
02:09:16,247 --> 02:09:18,125
The sonic emitter
has been destroyed.

1623
02:09:40,355 --> 02:09:41,857

1639

Get us to the desert.

1640
02:11:15,826 --> 02:11:17,118
<i>No!</i>

1641
02:12:14,550 --> 02:12:15,611

<i>All right, come here.</i>

1645
02:14:45,993 --> 02:14:47,793
May the ancestors save us

We may be going to join them.

1648

If so, hey,

1649
02:14:53,417 --> 02:14:55,670
let us take as many of them
with us as we can.

1650
02:15:25,783 --> 02:15:27,202

I'm not my brother.

1656

Namor will beg me for mercy

1657
02:16:00,693 --> 02:16:03,237

1658

Wakanda forever!

1659
02:18:37,057 --> 02:18:38,559
Shuri.

1660
02:18:40,102 --> 02:18:41,103
Mama.

1661
02:18:44,065 --> 02:18:45,358

will protect your oceans.

All set to head home?

As long as you're sure
the police

1687
02:21:32,399 --> 02:21:33,919
won't be waiting for me
at the airport.

1688
02:21:34,027 --> 02:21:35,654
Don't worry.
Took care of that.

1689
02:21:35,819 --> 02:21:37,112
But you might want to slow down

1690
02:21:37,197 --> 02:21:39,449
on your
homework-for-hire business.

1691
02:21:39,531 --> 02:21:41,910
Get caught slipping,
I can't help you with that.

1692
02:21:43,202 --> 02:21:45,181
They said you wanted
to talk to me about something?

1693
02:21:45,205 --> 02:21:46,206
Yes.

1694
02:21:46,539 --> 02:21:49,751
Your suit.
It's a great design,

1695
02:21:50,292 --> 02:21:51,572
but can't let you leave with it.

It's all good.

1697
02:21:53,003 --> 02:21:54,297
Figured the least I could do

is help Wakanda
clean up my mess.

Come.

1701
02:22:04,224 --> 02:22:07,309
Took me a while to find
all the parts from the river,

1702
02:22:07,476 --> 02:22:08,852
but it was worth it.

1703
02:22:09,521 --> 02:22:10,521
How did you...

1704
02:22:11,855 --> 02:22:13,399
It's my dad's car.

What the hell is this?

1729
02:25:33,850 --> 02:25:36,269
Can we turn around?

1730
02:25:36,685 --> 02:25:38,646
I don't know, man.
We'll lose an hour.

1731
02:25:40,064 --> 02:25:41,482
Why don't you go check it out?

1732
02:25:41,565 --> 02:25:42,859
Okay.

1733
02:25:45,653 --> 02:25:46,946
Yeah, this is Shauver.

1734
02:25:47,362 --> 02:25:49,364

a tree blocking our way.

1735
02:25:49,531 --> 02:25:51,242

02:31:56,022 --> 02:31:57,023
Hi.

1787
02:32:17,961 --> 02:32:20,630
We agreed it was better
for him to grow up here.

1788
02:32:20,798 --> 02:32:23,884
Away from the pressure
of the throne.

1789
02:32:25,261 --> 02:32:26,469
Your father,

1790
02:32:27,095 --> 02:32:28,848
your <i>baba,</i>

1791
02:32:29,014 --> 02:32:31,683
prepared us for his death,
didn't he?

1792
02:32:36,354 --> 02:32:38,398
But he didn't want us
to go to the funeral

1793
02:32:39,233 --> 02:32:42,153
because he felt the time
was not yet right.

1794
02:32:42,861 --> 02:32:45,655
So we had our own ceremony
for him here.

1795
02:32:47,407 --> 02:32:48,993
Did my mother meet him?

1796
02:32:49,075 --> 02:32:50,076
She did.

1797
02:32:59,670 --> 02:33:00,796
It's nice to meet you.

1798
02:33:00,879 --> 02:33:02,173
Nice to meet you.

1799
02:33:02,340 --> 02:33:03,883
Toussaint is a beautiful name.

1800
02:33:04,383 --> 02:33:06,510
It holds a great history.

1801
02:33:06,676 --> 02:33:09,971
Thanks. Yours is cool, too,
I guess.

1802
02:33:13,267 --> 02:33:15,435
My mom says you are good
at keeping secrets.

1803
02:33:15,519 --> 02:33:16,520
Is that true?

1804
02:33:17,771 --> 02:33:20,565
Yes, I can keep a good secret.

1805
02:33:23,568 --> 02:33:25,862
Toussaint is my Haitian name.

1806
02:33:30,910 --> 02:33:33,119
My name is Prince T'Challa,

1807
02:33:33,203 --> 02:33:35,121
son of King T'Challa.
