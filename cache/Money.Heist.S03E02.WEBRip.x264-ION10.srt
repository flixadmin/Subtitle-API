1
00:00:16,041 --> 00:00:22,881
MADRID
D-DAY

2
00:00:58,333 --> 00:00:59,963
Remember the Chernobyl Plan?

3
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:02,503
It was a desperate plan
from the previous job.

4
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:05,671
It involved collapsing Madrid
with a shower of bank notes

5
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,130
to escape among the turmoil
in case everything went wrong.

6
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:10,166
The plan was intended
to create chaos.

7
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:15,130
And that was exactly
what we needed now.

8
00:01:15,916 --> 00:01:16,746
Chaos.

9
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,420
Do you want to answer it?

10
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,330
Hello?

11
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:33,996
Wait, zeppelins?

12
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:57,171
I'll be there in eight minutes.

13
00:01:59,916 --> 00:02:03,286
The zeppelins are programmed to fly
to certain GPS coordinates,

14
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:07,245
and only then
will they open their hatches.

15
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:11,253
Afterwards, they will fly in circles
within a radius of 250 meters

16
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:14,253
and they will release wads of money
every 40 seconds

17
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:15,293
for 50 minutes.

18
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:17,538
This...

19
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:21,541
at a height of 300 meters,
like manna falling from the sky.

20
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:26,245
In total, we'll release
140 million euros.

21
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:31,963
It's going to be expensive
to venture into the lion's den, huh?

22
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:34,955
You...

23
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:37,958
We have all been called
Robin Hoods.

24
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,630
It makes sense that part of the loot
ends with the people.

25
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:24,458
This message...

26
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:30,000
goes to all of you who believe that
this mask is a symbol of the resistance.

27
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:32,923
We need you.

28
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:35,878
The State has declared war
against us.

29
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:37,381
A dirty war.

30
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:39,961
We have decided to stand
up to them.

31
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,420
The police have arrested one of us
in a foreign country.

32
00:03:59,125 --> 00:03:59,995
Aníbal.

33
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:02,288
You can't sleep?

34
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:03,881
Aníbal Cortés.

35
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:08,673
Come with me.

36
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,503
Let's go get some more coffee.

37
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,713
It's been almost two months
since that happened.

38
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,418
No legal proceedings
have been initiated.

39
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,043
No extradition has been requested.

40
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:23,753
No defense lawyer
has been provided.

41
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:25,168
He's kept in captivity...

42
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,923
somewhere unknown,
and most likely...

43
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:30,916
he's being tortured.

44
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:36,995
We demand...

45
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:41,995
the immediate end
to this illegal detention

46
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:45,503
and that he be brought to justice in a way
that respects all legal safeguards.

47
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:48,793
The State has begun this war.

48
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:50,915
And we shall not hide.

49
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:54,541
We shall fight,

50
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:57,583
blow...

51
00:04:58,916 --> 00:04:59,746
for blow.

52
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:02,173
And this time...

53
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,380
CALLAO THEATER

54
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:06,958
We're going big.

55
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,830
Furthermore,

56
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:29,831
this is a game of chess.

57
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:35,253
We're moving pieces
that will force the intelligence agency

58
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,496
to move theirs.

59
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:40,003
And Prieto will only be able
to do one thing...

60
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:44,671
I want the army in the streets!

61
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,630
They expect us to run
after those balloons,

62
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:51,578
but it's the biggest distraction tactic
we've ever seen.

63
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:53,126
Raise alert to Level 5.

64
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:56,078
If they have the fucking nerve
to announce they're stealing again,

65
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:58,996
they'll find everything
under protection. Shit!

66
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,423
Whoever strikes first...

67
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,630
has time on their side, but whoever
has to defend against that attack

68
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:06,538
won't have that much time
to think about it,

69
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:10,955
so Prieto will have to improvise
his strongest defense on the fly.

70
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,671
The PM just gave us the green light.

71
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,670
I want Madrid full of soldiers.

72
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,630
I also want LMVs,
armored cars...

73
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:21,133
Armored cars, fuck! Armored cars!
There's nothing wrong with my mouth.

74
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:23,753
There lies our ruse.

75
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:33,213
Coming!

76
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:40,961
Martín.

77
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:47,538
May I?

78
00:07:55,208 --> 00:08:00,038
PALERMO, ITALY
2 MONTHS LEFT UNTIL D-DAY

79
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,080
Want a drink?

80
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,171
The job was amazing.

81
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,455
I'm glad you're alive.

82
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:42,381
Thanks.

83
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:44,458
However, if you stay outside,
hidden like a rat,

84
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,961
your chances of survival increase.

85
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:53,746
- I was the most exposed during the job.
- No. Don't bullshit me.

86
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:59,330
Whoever faces the bullets
is the most exposed.

87
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:01,786
- How many times were you shot at?
- I'm not here to argue.

88
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:06,171
Quite frankly,
I couldn't care less why you're here.

89
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,455
Three years later...

90
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:10,921
and here you are.

91
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:14,916
So, I'll tell you
why you didn't go into the Mint.

92
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,125
Because you're a coward.

93
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:26,915
And because...

94
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:30,496
you had him do the dirty work.

95
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:32,423
Your brother.

96
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:36,535
A job always involves unknowns.
You know that.

97
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:37,825
Unknowns?

98
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:42,918
Let me be really clear.

99
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:48,078
You didn't go in...

100
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:52,126
and a third of your group died,
you son of a bitch.

101
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:58,251
A third of your group died
and you did nothing, for fuck's sake.

102
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,381
I'm as sorry as you are...

103
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:06,456
What the fuck are you sorry for?
You son of a bitch!

104
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:12,333
Andrés wouldn't have died
if I had been there.

105
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,750
I'd have gone in
and gotten him out!

106
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,423
No matter the fucking cost!

107
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:23,248
Even if I had to blow up
the whole building!

108
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,713
I wouldn't have let him die!
But you did!

109
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,705
Who the fuck do you think
you're talking to,

110
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,541
one of those idiots
from your group?

111
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:31,955
I know you well, Sergio.

112
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,496
I know what you're like.

113
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,540
He was my friend.

114
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:40,131
Someone indispensable to me.

115
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,125
He was my other half.

116
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:44,626
Look into my eyes...

117
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:47,958
and tell me you never
considered that.

118
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:51,126
That, if need be,
he would let himself be killed.

119
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:55,705
Tell me that when you thought
the plan out, you son of a bitch,

120
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:58,791
you never considered
your brother's death.

121
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:10,881
I didn't consider
my brother's death.

122
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,285
Not once.

123
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:27,995
He was my life.

124
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:41,291
I'm sorry.
It's not really your fault.

125
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,580
It wasn't your fault.

126
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:44,955
It wasn't.

127
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,208
How are you?

128
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:55,126
All right.

129
00:11:57,916 --> 00:11:59,626
Hanging around
with Johnnie Walker...

130
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,955
sucking down pills,
eating canned food.

131
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,041
But I'm all right.

132
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:07,538
I found the formula.

133
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:10,538
Music.

134
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:18,083
Have you locked yourself up and
been listening to music all this time?

135
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,286
I can listen to music from my youth
and travel there.

136
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:35,916
To the shabbiest music bars
of Buenos Aires.

137
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,166
I dance and swing like before...

138
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,211
when pain didn't exist.

139
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:49,081
Dance with me.

140
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:50,746
Come on, don't be an ass.

141
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:52,133
Dance!

142
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:55,631
There you go.

143
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:57,501
Try this.

144
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:05,915
Why are you here?

145
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,075
To ask your permission.

146
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:20,205
I'm going to steal the gold.

147
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:24,958
I'd tell you
it's in my brother's memory, but...

148
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,880
the truth is...

149
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:30,923
I need to do it.

150
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:35,383
And I won't do it without you.

151
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,330
Mónica.

152
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:23,166
- Denver, not now.
- No, it's got to be now.

153
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,080
Because I'm not going in
if we don't fix it.

154
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,826
Grab your M16
and do what you have to.

155
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:30,326
I didn't mean what I said.

156
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:33,576
It was 3:00 in the morning.
I'm a loudmouth, forgive me.

157
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,670
But to stop talking to me
for three days...

158
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:50,831
Things are starting to move.

159
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:02,626
Can you hear me?

160
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:03,538
Copy.

161
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:05,418
- Can you?
- Hold on.

162
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:07,331
Now. Try again.

163
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:10,423
What are you wearing, Inspector?

164
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,080
Let's do it.

165
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:34,921
With money to invest in R&D,
you can achieve wonderful things.

166
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,288
Three weeks prior to the job,

167
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:40,705
we were inside both the CNI's
and the police's mobile phones

168
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,961
apps like WhatsApp.

169
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:46,458
We could activate their mics,

170
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:48,541
cameras and GPS.

171
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:50,415
ISLAMABAD
PAKISTAN

172
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:55,001
It took less than an hour to take over
the defense staff's telecommunications.

173
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:57,578
Rio's job...

174
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,631
was now done by 65 Pakistanis.

175
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:08,496
They didn't look like they went to
parties in Silicon Valley,

176
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:09,833
but they were geniuses.

177
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:12,706
Thanks to them,
we had access to everything.

178
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:16,328
Seventy-six.

179
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:25,003
Three.

180
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,580
Three hundred twelve.

181
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,748
Top priority
for the following forward lines.

182
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:37,333
Second Squad, First Company of Brunete,
the Congress of Deputies.

183
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:40,916
First Squad, Second Company
of Cuatro Vientos, the Royal Palace.

184
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,710
Third Squad, First Company of Paracuellos,
the Senate.

185
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:47,251
First Squad, Seventh Company of El Goloso,
Moncloa Palace.

186
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,713
First Squad,
Sixth Company of BRIPAC,

187
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:50,711
Bank of Spain.

188
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:51,831
BANK OF SPAIN
BRIPAC

189
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:54,381
Attention.

190
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:57,458
Yours is the First Squad,
Sixth Company of BRIPAC.

191
00:16:58,541 --> 00:16:59,881
Ladies and gentlemen,

192
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:03,250
ours is the First Squad,
Sixth Company of BRIPAC.

193
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:05,538
One-six, BRIPAC.

194
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,075
You have 17 minutes.

195
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:12,996
We have 16 minutes
and 45 seconds!

196
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:16,923
Warm heart, cool head.
Come on!

197
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,165
BRIPAC!

198
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:31,955
Sixth company!

199
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:36,631
V-I?

200
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,213
BPAC VI

201
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:51,290
Do I need to say again
that there's no time left? Move!

202
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,830
All ready in 7 minutes!

203
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:58,418
Hurry the fuck up!

204
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:46,333
3 DAYS LEFT UNTIL D-DAY

205
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,293
Stop shaking your leg,
you're going to wake Cincinnati.

206
00:18:57,666 --> 00:18:59,166
Cincinnati is very quiet.

207
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:01,458
But I'm not.

208
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:06,376
So, I'll tell you straight out,
I don't want you to go into the bank.

209
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:08,333
We have a fucking baby.

210
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:10,376
- Calm down before...
- I'm not calming down.

211
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:13,458
I'm not calming down because
I haven't slept for three weeks.

212
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:15,415
We are no Bonnie and Clyde,
Mónica.

213
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,250
You're a management secretary,
not Rambo.

214
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:19,455
Shit!

215
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,210
- Denver...
- What?

216
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:25,668
I'm ready to go in and I will.

217
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,580
Ready to do what?

218
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,626
To be here,
camping with the Professor?

219
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:30,208
At the summer camp of crime!

220
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:32,831
- Listen to me!
- No, you listen to me, Mónica!

221
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:36,038
I've been preparing
since I was a child.

222
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,290
I'd go into the street with a ball
and they'd just take it from me.

223
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:42,535
And what did I do? Fight.
And the next day, it would happen again.

224
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:44,535
And the next, and the next...

225
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:46,705
By the time I was 9,
no one dared to step up to me.

226
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:49,541
You can't learn that in a day.
And you can't leave a kid...

227
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:55,211
here with some monks.

228
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,880
I'm not leaving my kid.

229
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:59,541
It's only going to be for three days,
not forever.

230
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:00,915
What about breastfeeding him?

231
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,790
Breastfeeding him?
The kid already eats steak!

232
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:04,955
- You're taking away his breast milk.
- No!

233
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:06,461
Helsi, are you awake?

234
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,288
Yes, awake.

235
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,325
You're his mother,
for fuck's sake!

236
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:13,246
I can't sleep
with Jesus Christ watching...

237
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:14,463
Christ is watching those two.

238
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:18,168
Listen to Denver...
I'm done with him.

239
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,210
Shut up!

240
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,166
And listen to me.

241
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:24,000
I am a mother.
But I'm also your wife.

242
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:26,665
- And I'm a robber too.
- No, you're not.

243
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,790
Having a kid doesn't mean
I have to renounce the other two.

244
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:32,575
Same as you. You're a dad, but
you don't even consider sitting it out.

245
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:35,456
We may not be Bonnie and Clyde,
but I learn fast

246
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:37,328
and I don't flinch.

247
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,996
I prepared and passed
my exam for the Royal Mint in six weeks.

248
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:42,713
What's that got to do with it?
There are no exams for robbery!

249
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:44,575
The office girl is gone.

250
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:48,461
Mónica Gaztambide is gone, Denver.

251
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:51,333
She stayed back at the Royal Mint

252
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,916
shooting at the police
to save you, Tokyo and Rio.

253
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,750
So, don't tell me I'm sitting it out
to warm up baby bottles,

254
00:20:57,833 --> 00:21:00,423
because I am more of a robber
than any other motherfucker.

255
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:02,503
Fucking sexist.

256
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:08,881
Nairobi.

257
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:11,133
- Don't leave me alone.
- Hey!

258
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:12,708
Are you all right?

259
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:14,041
No, I'm not all right.

260
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,375
Can't blame you.
I heard it all.

261
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,668
That ass talking
about breastfeeding and all.

262
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:22,003
- You're part of this gang.
- Mónica, you didn't get what I meant.

263
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:24,923
She got every single thing you said.
You are a real caveman!

264
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,460
- Go to bed!
- I'm not talking to you!

265
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:28,791
- Go to your cave!
- Are you all right, girls? What happened?

266
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:30,825
The patriarchy is fucking unbearable.

267
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:32,423
The patriarchy?

268
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,380
Patriarchy, that old model
with its macho chauvinism...

269
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:36,578
Speaking of that.

270
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:38,786
Do you know what
the real patriarchy is?

271
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:39,705
What?

272
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:40,791
It's hanging here!

273
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:42,745
What the fuck is wrong with you!
It's 3 a.m.

274
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:44,083
Relax!

275
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:44,996
Go and do the dishes!

276
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:47,463
You're not sexist,
you're just an asshole!

277
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:50,381
Go to your room!
Go count your pubic hairs!

278
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:51,828
Me and my dick and my dick...

279
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:58,253
Do you know what time it is?

280
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:00,833
It's 3 a.m.

281
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:03,746
Tomorrow morning we need
to practice with the thermic lances,

282
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:07,543
at 3580 degrees Celsius.
I think...

283
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:10,503
you should rest.

284
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:15,708
Go to bed.

285
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,380
Mónica, please, come with me.

286
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:25,420
Sorry, Professor.
We had a fight...

287
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:29,705
I was going to sleep with Tokyo.

288
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:52,081
42 MINUTES PAST H-HOUR

289
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,080
Are you all right?

290
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:04,785
Nervous.

291
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:07,326
Well, calm down
because this is like...

292
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:09,785
playing chess.

293
00:23:10,375 --> 00:23:12,875
More like
the World Chess Championship, so...

294
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:15,415
It's going to be a long match.

295
00:23:16,458 --> 00:23:18,128
The opening...

296
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:19,750
One battle and...

297
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:23,083
two opposing strategies.

298
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:27,583
And then checkmate.

299
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,330
Look.

300
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:42,881
Here, on this side.

301
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:44,668
See if you can feel it.

302
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:47,788
Another one.

303
00:23:48,541 --> 00:23:49,751
Yeah.

304
00:23:50,916 --> 00:23:52,126
Like a tiny kick.

305
00:23:55,708 --> 00:23:58,708
Every time I have some coffee,
it goes crazy in there.

306
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:02,253
Now, tell me about the carrier.

307
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:07,535
I don't know anything
about any handler.

308
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:08,455
You don't?

309
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:10,955
Yes, you do.

310
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:21,673
Put the mask on.

311
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:28,673
I don't want to.

312
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:33,133
Either you do it or I get
Osman to do it.

313
00:24:41,791 --> 00:24:42,631
Come on...

314
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:46,963
Another little horsey ride.

315
00:24:50,416 --> 00:24:52,036
Let's see if we start remembering.

316
00:24:53,541 --> 00:24:55,211
My ankles are so swollen.

317
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,330
There they are.

318
00:25:04,416 --> 00:25:05,416
Motherfuckers!

319
00:25:17,208 --> 00:25:20,168
I was overwhelmed
by all those people insulting us.

320
00:25:26,875 --> 00:25:29,955
I'd have liked to lean
out the window and shout.

321
00:25:30,708 --> 00:25:33,538
I'm Tokyo, one of you.

322
00:25:34,708 --> 00:25:36,038
We are Dalí...

323
00:25:38,875 --> 00:25:40,705
This mask has become a symbol.

324
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,210
Across the whole world.

325
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:45,995
Whether for those resisting,

326
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
indignant or skeptical...
it doesn't matter.

327
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,130
What really matters is
that it has inspired many people.

328
00:25:53,375 --> 00:25:54,205
Look at that.

329
00:25:55,375 --> 00:25:58,205
This is a demonstration against
corruption in Rio de Janeiro.

330
00:26:01,625 --> 00:26:03,415
Buenos Aires, Argentina,

331
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:06,000
several women's rights marches.

332
00:26:09,708 --> 00:26:10,538
Colombia.

333
00:26:13,666 --> 00:26:14,496
Rome.

334
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:16,705
Paris.

335
00:26:20,166 --> 00:26:22,166
The G20 Summit in Hamburg.

336
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:24,746
LIBERTY, EQUALITY,
RESISTANCE

337
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:27,583
They have filled entire stadiums.

338
00:26:27,666 --> 00:26:28,876
This is France.

339
00:26:32,041 --> 00:26:33,211
Saudi Arabia.

340
00:26:33,875 --> 00:26:35,745
What I'm trying to explain
to you is that

341
00:26:35,833 --> 00:26:38,293
we have inspired many people
to fight with us.

342
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:42,670
All those people are now one of us.

343
00:26:48,916 --> 00:26:50,416
Don't you ever forget that.

344
00:26:54,333 --> 00:26:55,333
And there they were.

345
00:26:56,041 --> 00:26:58,081
The Professor had put on the mask,

346
00:26:58,333 --> 00:27:00,423
called all the Dalís out

347
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,920
and the Dalís had responded.

348
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:07,210
They planned it all out
on social media and WhatsApp groups.

349
00:27:07,291 --> 00:27:08,541
And they shouted

350
00:27:08,625 --> 00:27:11,535
what we needed to hear the most.

351
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:14,250
You will never walk alone.

352
00:27:15,583 --> 00:27:17,293
ENOUGH

353
00:27:20,708 --> 00:27:22,788
But that was mere poetry.

354
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:25,875
The real action
was about to begin then and there.

355
00:27:26,416 --> 00:27:28,326
TRAITORS

356
00:27:30,625 --> 00:27:33,165
BANK OF SPAIN
47 MINUTES PAST H-HOUR

357
00:27:37,083 --> 00:27:38,503
Come on! Move, move!

358
00:27:45,416 --> 00:27:48,496
- Step back! Everyone!
- Let's all stay calm.

359
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:49,963
Come on, come on!

360
00:27:50,041 --> 00:27:52,171
Don't move! Nobody moves!

361
00:27:59,625 --> 00:28:01,455
The real convoy is on its way.

362
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:13,581
It's five miles away.

363
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,580
Five miles only takes six minutes.

364
00:28:18,666 --> 00:28:20,746
They only have six minutes
to make it.

365
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:26,463
Hail Mary.

366
00:28:27,208 --> 00:28:28,208
Fuck off.

367
00:28:35,666 --> 00:28:39,376
You must answer, full of grace.
We're in a holy place.

368
00:28:39,458 --> 00:28:41,078
You can be such an ass...

369
00:28:43,875 --> 00:28:45,075
Good afternoon. May I?

370
00:28:45,166 --> 00:28:46,826
Of course, Sergio, of course.

371
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:48,080
Thank you.

372
00:28:50,458 --> 00:28:52,628
I've been studying the two plans,
in depth.

373
00:28:53,708 --> 00:28:56,078
I compared both.
And I must say that...

374
00:28:56,166 --> 00:28:59,166
The Royal Mint is difficult,
really difficult, but possible.

375
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:00,080
Even sensible.

376
00:29:00,916 --> 00:29:02,706
But to break into
the Bank of Spain...

377
00:29:04,208 --> 00:29:06,078
is crazy...

378
00:29:06,666 --> 00:29:09,286
and, most importantly,
impossible.

379
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,710
- It may seem impossible...
- It is.

380
00:29:12,791 --> 00:29:14,631
And this seeming impossibility

381
00:29:15,291 --> 00:29:16,961
makes it very pretty.

382
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,380
It seems impossible, but...

383
00:29:22,541 --> 00:29:24,081
Palermo, fill us in.

384
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,710
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the Bank of Spain.

385
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:31,376
We go 10 meters under the floor,
20...

386
00:29:31,708 --> 00:29:32,538
30...

387
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:34,080
40...

388
00:29:34,541 --> 00:29:35,751
And here she is.

389
00:29:37,583 --> 00:29:39,133
The vault.

390
00:29:39,208 --> 00:29:41,998
Forty-eight meters underground.

391
00:29:42,083 --> 00:29:45,753
The vault is completely airtight.

392
00:29:45,833 --> 00:29:46,673
Why?

393
00:29:47,916 --> 00:29:50,076
Because it can be flooded,
ladies and gentlemen.

394
00:29:50,166 --> 00:29:51,876
Damn ingenious Spaniards.

395
00:29:51,958 --> 00:29:54,378
You must be a perverse son of a bitch
to think that out!

396
00:29:54,458 --> 00:29:56,748
- Show some respect.
- It's a compliment.

397
00:29:56,833 --> 00:29:59,543
It's great. It's a masterpiece.

398
00:29:59,625 --> 00:30:00,625
Unique in the world.

399
00:30:00,708 --> 00:30:04,208
They channeled two streams
into the chamber with the gold.

400
00:30:04,291 --> 00:30:06,921
Twenty-eight miles of reinforced
pipes underground.

401
00:30:07,583 --> 00:30:09,583
- Why?
- So that in case someone

402
00:30:09,666 --> 00:30:11,376
touches this door...

403
00:30:15,208 --> 00:30:18,708
the chamber gets flooded
in less than 20 minutes.

404
00:30:19,625 --> 00:30:21,455
You touch the gold,

405
00:30:21,958 --> 00:30:25,578
and you explode like a toad,
you drown, man... a marvel!

406
00:30:27,666 --> 00:30:31,666
Everything is so discouraging that
nobody expects anyone to try and break in.

407
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:35,628
That's why it'll be all right.

408
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:37,208
Actually, it's very simple.

409
00:30:38,166 --> 00:30:39,826
If we use talent

410
00:30:40,375 --> 00:30:41,205
and science.

411
00:30:41,291 --> 00:30:43,921
The best minds in engineering...

412
00:30:45,041 --> 00:30:46,131
in physics,

413
00:30:46,666 --> 00:30:49,666
in fluid mechanics, can you imagine
them preparing for a job?

414
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,460
Excellency applied to robbery.

415
00:30:51,541 --> 00:30:53,791
But how on earth are you going in?

416
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:58,130
There is a unit of the Civil Guard,
20 private security guards.

417
00:30:58,208 --> 00:31:01,208
The governor's bodyguards.
And the place has strategic importance.

418
00:31:01,666 --> 00:31:03,326
The army would be there
within minutes.

419
00:31:03,916 --> 00:31:06,626
It's hard to get in
if you're dressed as a thief, yes.

420
00:31:07,041 --> 00:31:08,381
But, Sergio,

421
00:31:08,458 --> 00:31:09,918
imagine there's chaos,

422
00:31:10,208 --> 00:31:13,418
and you're the one everyone
is expecting to save the day.

423
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:19,333
And it's so easy to create chaos, brother.
Let me tell you...

424
00:31:20,041 --> 00:31:22,251
they will greet us
with their arms wide open.

425
00:31:24,041 --> 00:31:26,041
CIVIL GUARD

426
00:31:27,083 --> 00:31:28,633
Captain Garrido,

427
00:31:28,708 --> 00:31:31,078
First Squad,
Sixth Company of BRIPAC.

428
00:31:31,166 --> 00:31:32,286
Lieutenant Alcázar.

429
00:31:32,375 --> 00:31:33,915
We're ordered to safeguard
the building.

430
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,750
I want all those people out.

431
00:31:39,458 --> 00:31:42,788
We need to widen the security perimeter
150 meters from the bank façade.

432
00:31:42,875 --> 00:31:45,875
And open the back doors.
There's a convoy on the way.

433
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,500
Ladies, we're going in.

434
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:52,495
We've received orders to coordinate,

435
00:31:53,125 --> 00:31:54,915
but not to allow a convoy to enter.

436
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,880
Sir, the convoy is approaching.

437
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:00,383
I shall not give that order to my men.

438
00:32:10,416 --> 00:32:12,376
Stop that convoy.

439
00:32:17,458 --> 00:32:19,168
They're pulling us over, girls.

440
00:32:21,416 --> 00:32:22,246
Sir.

441
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:24,878
I request immediate entry.

442
00:32:26,916 --> 00:32:27,746
Jiménez.

443
00:32:29,625 --> 00:32:30,625
Give me your radio.

444
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,630
Staff Headquarters.

445
00:32:37,708 --> 00:32:41,038
Lieutenant Alcázar speaking,
Civil Guard unit.

446
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:43,825
I urgently request access confirmation
for the BRIPAC squad

447
00:32:43,916 --> 00:32:45,496
into the Bank of Spain.

448
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,790
What the fuck is going on?

449
00:32:54,291 --> 00:32:58,001
This is Lieutenant Colonel Castro.
Alert Level 5 has just been declared.

450
00:32:58,083 --> 00:33:00,003
I repeat, Alert Level 5.
From now on,

451
00:33:00,083 --> 00:33:03,833
the army will be in charge of the defense
within the Bank and its perimeter.

452
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:07,080
So, start coordinating your men
and follow Captain Garrido's orders

453
00:33:07,166 --> 00:33:09,206
until Colonel Cerceda arrives,
do you copy?

454
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,750
Yes, sir. Understood.

455
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,420
Let's widen the security perimeter!

456
00:33:38,041 --> 00:33:40,671
I want all those lowlifes
on the other side of the street.

457
00:33:49,625 --> 00:33:51,875
Let's clear the area
until the squad arrives.

458
00:33:52,833 --> 00:33:54,383
Get the tear gas ready!

459
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:57,423
And let's get the tear gas ready!

460
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:05,455
Let them in.
Authorization confirmed.

461
00:34:23,041 --> 00:34:25,631
Now we're finally in.

462
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:46,786
Do you know what aikido is?

463
00:34:46,875 --> 00:34:48,325
Yes, an AC.

464
00:34:48,416 --> 00:34:52,666
No, those shitty thin chocolate sticks,
neither a snack nor an appetizer.

465
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:55,330
Ai-ki-do.

466
00:34:55,416 --> 00:34:57,916
Using the enemy's force
to your advantage.

467
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,250
We alone can't break into
the Bank of Spain.

468
00:35:00,333 --> 00:35:02,673
The enemy's force
is much greater than ours.

469
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:03,580
So...

470
00:35:05,833 --> 00:35:07,083
we shall apply aikido.

471
00:35:07,166 --> 00:35:09,206
How, aikido, Professor?

472
00:35:09,291 --> 00:35:11,211
Whatever we're not able to do

473
00:35:11,291 --> 00:35:13,541
will be done by the Civil Guard,

474
00:35:13,625 --> 00:35:16,575
the Spanish Army
and the bank's private security.

475
00:35:18,166 --> 00:35:21,416
They will ensure that no one comes
closer than 150 meters from the building.

476
00:35:22,625 --> 00:35:25,415
We'll find out the exact number
of hostages in the building.

477
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:27,495
How many people are there
in the building?

478
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:30,543
The security staff will provide
the numbers.

479
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,500
Three hundred and sixty-seven.

480
00:35:33,625 --> 00:35:34,455
Aikido.

481
00:35:34,541 --> 00:35:37,541
I want all 367 people here
in three minutes.

482
00:35:37,625 --> 00:35:38,825
We'll place charges

483
00:35:38,916 --> 00:35:42,666
on façades and windows, in broad daylight,
in the street and unseen. How?

484
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:46,250
Thanks to the smoke the Civil Guards
will throw to clear the crowd.

485
00:35:46,875 --> 00:35:48,165
Aikido.

486
00:36:23,791 --> 00:36:25,421
Evacuation protocol.

487
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,750
I want everyone down here
in three minutes.

488
00:36:27,833 --> 00:36:29,043
Move!

489
00:36:29,125 --> 00:36:30,955
- This is not an evacuation drill.
- Now.

490
00:36:31,041 --> 00:36:32,041
Evacuation protocol.

491
00:36:32,125 --> 00:36:34,535
We'll take the clients and employees
out of the building,

492
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:36,035
following a strict protocol.

493
00:36:36,708 --> 00:36:37,538
How?

494
00:36:38,125 --> 00:36:39,875
Let's proceed
with the evacuation.

495
00:36:39,958 --> 00:36:42,378
I want everyone down here
right now!

496
00:36:47,666 --> 00:36:48,876
Evacuation protocol.

497
00:36:48,958 --> 00:36:50,248
Proceed in an orderly manner.

498
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:55,170
The Civil Guards and the security staff
will raid the building,

499
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:56,500
office by office,

500
00:36:56,583 --> 00:36:58,883
and will evacuate everyone
in less than three minutes.

501
00:36:58,958 --> 00:36:59,958
Aikido!

502
00:37:00,041 --> 00:37:01,791
Hurry up! Hurry up!

503
00:37:01,875 --> 00:37:03,455
Hurry up! Hurry up!

504
00:37:07,541 --> 00:37:09,541
Come on, hurry up!

505
00:37:09,625 --> 00:37:12,455
They'll help us get in all the material
we'll need for the job.

506
00:37:18,625 --> 00:37:19,495
Come on!

507
00:37:26,833 --> 00:37:27,673
Come on!

508
00:37:28,333 --> 00:37:30,423
Come on! Come on!

509
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,750
Please, I need you all to keep calm.

510
00:37:33,208 --> 00:37:35,628
We will evacuate the building
in two groups.

511
00:37:35,875 --> 00:37:37,165
Group 1 and Group 2.

512
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:39,130
And they will escort
the spare hostages out.

513
00:37:39,208 --> 00:37:41,958
They will all leave together
and will rid us of a problem.

514
00:37:42,041 --> 00:37:43,251
Aikido!

515
00:37:43,333 --> 00:37:44,673
Group 1, out now!

516
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,750
- Don't move, don't move.
- Back off.

517
00:37:49,833 --> 00:37:50,883
Come on.

518
00:37:50,958 --> 00:37:54,288
Move forward, move forward! Go, go!

519
00:37:54,375 --> 00:37:55,955
Move forward, move forward!

520
00:37:56,041 --> 00:37:56,961
Go, go!

521
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:57,921
Move forward!

522
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,580
Don't stay there! Move!

523
00:37:59,666 --> 00:38:00,876
Everyone out!

524
00:38:02,041 --> 00:38:04,461
Don't stop moving!
Go to the end of the street!

525
00:38:04,541 --> 00:38:05,831
Move, move!

526
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:07,126
Move!

527
00:38:08,041 --> 00:38:09,041
Keep walking!

528
00:38:18,708 --> 00:38:22,168
Move forward! Come on!

529
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:23,710
Move, madam!

530
00:38:23,791 --> 00:38:25,041
Then,

531
00:38:25,125 --> 00:38:26,875
when everyone is where
they have to be,

532
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:35,131
we'll just need to push a button.

533
00:38:39,833 --> 00:38:40,833
And I'll push...

534
00:38:41,833 --> 00:38:43,043
that button.

535
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:13,960
There's no turning back.
