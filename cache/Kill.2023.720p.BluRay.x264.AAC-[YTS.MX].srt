00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:52,654
-Good work. See you soon, fucker.
-Yes, sir!

4
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,116
Rathod!

5
00:01:56,408 --> 00:01:57,409
Hurry up, man!

6
00:01:57,618 --> 00:02:00,162
I haven't even taken a peaceful dump
in 10 days.

7
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:13,383
You smell like shit.

8
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:17,137
As if you are smelling
like a bouquet of roses.

9
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,767
Captain Viresh Chatwal.

10
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:26,021
I'll see you in the room.

11
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:30,567
Captain Amrit Rathod.

12
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:37,407
Dude, don't wake me up until tomorrow.

13
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:38,784
Come on, bro.

14
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:41,662
Let's have a couple of drinks
and then drop dead.

15
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,165
Bro!

16
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:46,458
Tulika's trying to get in touch.

17
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,210
It's urgent. Call her.

18
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:00,889
You are missing, man.
Please call me back right now

19
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:02,307
Amrit, where are you?

20
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,434
I've been trying to reach you for days.

21
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:07,104
Dad has fixed my engagement with someone.

22
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,856
It's happening tomorrow.

23
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:10,065
Tomorrow!

24
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,361
I'm coming to Ranchi.

25
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:28,458
Sister,

26
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:31,295
why did you agree to this engagement?

27
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:36,216
It doesn't matter who I get engaged to.

28
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,469
I will only marry Amrit.

29
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:47,769
Careful.

30
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,904
Welcome! Bless you!

31
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:17,382
-Congratulations, Mom.
-To you, too.

32
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:18,926
-Thank you.
-Please come.

33
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:20,928
Do visit us.

34
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:22,054
Good bye.

35
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:46,536
You... are so dead!

36
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,039
Listen up, all is set.

37
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:50,457
Meet me in the washroom
in five minutes.

38
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,334
Nice thought! But, no.

39
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,295
Didn't I say
I can't run away from Ranchi?

40
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:56,922
-It's too risky.
-Trust me.

41
00:04:57,089 --> 00:04:59,299
We'll be gone before anyone finds out.
Come on.

42
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:00,842
Impossible.

43
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:04,096
Did you hear the fireworks earlier?

44
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:08,725
They were real gunshots.

45
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,436
They can very well be aimed at us.

46
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:13,105
My dad...

47
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:17,442
is too powerful.
So... no, thank you. Leave for now.

48
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:19,319
Aren't you dying to be with me?

49
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:23,240
Why do I need to die to be with you?

50
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:29,621
I want to live my life with you,
Captain Rathod.

51
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,048
Abort.

52
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:42,092
What?

53
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:43,677
But I'm in position.

54
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,846
It's risky, tiger. Abort mission.

55
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:54,688
She didn't elope fearing her dad.

56
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:57,482
What if she refuses to marry you
because of him? Then what?

57
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,611
Bro,

58
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:04,823
our love is much more powerful
than her dad.

59
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,491
What a line, Captain!

60
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:18,503
The engagement was lovely.

61
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:20,589
We'll see you soon.

62
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,883
-Bless you!
-Just a second.

63
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,468
Bless you, dear.

64
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:26,762
Put the bags inside.

65
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:29,973
I'll take her in. You come back.

66
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,987
Oh, man!

67
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,617
Bro, please drop me off.

68
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,036
Dad has started calling me.

69
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:57,042
I swear, once he's onto something,
he just doesn't stop.

70
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,588
Sorry.

71
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:45,340
Thank you.

72
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,716
Bloody hell!

73
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:48,844
Hello?

74
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:51,972
Why have a phone
if you're not going to bloody answer?

75
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:53,598
To watch YouTube videos!

76
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:55,559
Fani!

77
00:07:57,185 --> 00:08:00,438
I was trying to make it to the train.
Don't think you'd want me to miss it.

78
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:02,065
Listen carefully.

79
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:04,568
We've reached the railway crossing.

80
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,361
You have 30 minutes for the job.

81
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,613
What's your coach number?

82
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:14,619
Fani?

83
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,708
Coach number?

84
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,087
Excuse me... what coach is this?

85
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,464
-A1.
-A1. Thank you.

86
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,509
Fani, answer me!

87
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,012
Fani?

88
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,471
A1.

89
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:35,390
A1.

90
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:37,475
Remember, you just have 30--

91
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:44,399
If I die early it will be only
because of this moron.

92
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,026
Uncle, please...

93
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:52,157
You!

94
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:54,159
It's me!

95
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,369
Amrit, we were to meet in Delhi.

96
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,996
You're going to get me killed.

97
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:00,040
I have to go.
Dad will come looking for me.

98
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:01,249
Amrit!

99
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,637
Amrit?

100
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,058
What!

101
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:22,187
Amrit, what are you doing?

102
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,573
Tulika Singh...

103
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,201
will you please marry me?

104
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:40,163
You're totally mad.

105
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,707
Completely cuckoo!

106
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,709
Please say yes quickly,

107
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:47,712
this commode is a buffet of aromas.

108
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:50,799
Yes.

109
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,218
-Yes?
-Yes!

110
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,599
Just a moment.

111
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,162
Why is your face glowing?

112
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:27,043
Are you from the army?

113
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,128
Yes.

114
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:30,755
In fact, both of us are.
We're Captains.

115
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,300
It's my childhood dream to join the Army.

116
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,552
Yeah? Then you should.

117
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:40,557
It's an emotional conflict between
Mommy Dearest and Mother India.

118
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,934
-Mom won't let me join.
-Shut up!

119
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:44,936
You need an excuse to pick on me.

120
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,187
That's the truth.

121
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,581
Please move your leg out of the way.

122
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,583
-Sorry.
-Sorry!

123
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:17,052
Are you a student?

124
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:19,596
Yes, sir.

125
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:22,557
Where do you study?

126
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,226
I study at Kanpur University.

127
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:26,853
Really?

128
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:30,982
My son just got accepted
into Kanpur University.

129
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:34,944
-But I'm nervous to send him so far away.
-Why is that?

130
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:49,959
-Mom, I'm going to the washroom.
-Take Virat.

131
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,003
Please, I'll manage.

132
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:56,132
Coaching, hostel, tuition... I'll guide
him with everything. Don't worry.

133
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:59,761
That will be a huge help to him.

134
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,137
Take my number down.

135
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:04,599
Two-- two-two--

136
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,851
Sorry, kid. It's occupied.

137
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:08,895
-The other one as well?
-Yes.

138
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,523
Yes, nine-eight-two-two--

139
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,525
Nine-eight-two-two--

140
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,027
-Three-three...
-That's quite a phone number!

141
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:17,529
It's a VIP number.

142
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,531
Wait. I'm going to the other side.

143
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,386
What's your name?

144
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:42,512
Gangadhar Mahto.

145
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,180
Gangadhar Mahto.

146
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:46,558
Why are they preparing to leave?

147
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:48,476
The next station is two hours away.

148
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,561
Is it?

149
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,714
I heard you.

150
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:21,050
I've boarded the evening train.
I'll be in Delhi by morning.

151
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,178
Hello?

152
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:25,472
Mother, we'll reach by 7:30.

153
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:27,807
No, baby...

154
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:31,060
our Amritsar tickets
need to be booked.

155
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:34,355
I wasn't even supposed to be here.
He begged and pleaded...

156
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,816
-Your voice isn't clear.
-Hello?

157
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,068
Hello?

158
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:45,742
-Pinky, are you getting any reception?
-No, I'm not getting any reception.

159
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:47,702
Forget it, I'll call in the morning.

160
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,268
Sit tight!

161
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:14,395
Nobody moves!

162
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:19,526
Where are you running?
Stop him. Catch him!

163
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:22,904
Come on, take out the money!

164
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:26,533
Where's Ahaana?

165
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:28,535
-She went to the washroom.
-I'll check.

166
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:33,248
-Where are you going?
-Dad... Ahaana.

167
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,671
-Hey!
-What's stopping you?

168
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,422
We know each other!

169
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,637
Don't you remember?
I asked you for the coach number?

170
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,765
And you flashed a radiant smile
and said, A1!

171
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,809
I even thanked you.

172
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,352
Now we are friends, right?

173
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:59,148
Give it to me.

174
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,442
Help!

175
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:11,911
Which face wash do you use?

176
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,663
He's blocking my view.

177
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:15,582
Look how her face is lighting up
the night!

178
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:17,333
-Excuse me--
-Step back!

179
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:22,672
The entire State's police force
will be unleashed on you.

180
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:24,465
You have no idea
who you're messing with.

181
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:27,427
He's Baldeo Singh Thakur.

182
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:29,345
Owner of Shanti Transport.

183
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:33,308
Holy cow!

184
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:35,935
We've hit the jackpot!

185
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,854
Get out of here.

186
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:39,981
Virat!

187
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:48,489
Since we've found our gold mine,
let's stop the looting here.

188
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:50,116
How about we kidnap them?

189
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:54,621
-You're making a huge mistake.
-Is it?

190
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:56,831
I'm warning you--

191
00:15:57,749 --> 00:15:59,125
Baldeo!

192
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:04,255
-Nobody moves.
-Stay back!

193
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,007
What's with all this wailing?

194
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,258
My son!

195
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,510
Your baby boy is still alive.

196
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:11,512
That big guy is dead.

197
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:12,639
What's his--

198
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:13,973
Hey!

199
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:17,852
My child!

200
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,604
What was his name?

201
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:22,774
I'm waiting.

202
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,028
Virat.

203
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:29,656
Virat?

204
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:31,658
Dammit!

205
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,035
Had I known,
I wouldn't have killed him.

206
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:36,245
I'm a huge fan of Virat.

207
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:37,413
Shit!

208
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,628
You still haven't told me
about your face wash.

209
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,172
Give me that watch!

210
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,383
Quick!

211
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:51,928
Mobile, wallet, all of it quick!
Give it here!

212
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,682
Give me your wallet!
Get it out!

213
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:59,936
What are you staring at?
Do you want me to stab you?

214
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,062
Quick, give it!

215
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:04,315
We'll kill you.

216
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,442
Let's go.

217
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:15,952
I've never had sex in a moving train.

218
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:17,453
Let go of me!

219
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:19,539
Leave her, please!

220
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:28,339
I'll kill her!

221
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:41,686
-Uncle!
-Dad!

222
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,187
-Move!
-Dad!

223
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,494
Leave, while you still can!

224
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,415
-Dad.
-Let's go.

225
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:03,499
Amrit!

226
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:06,002
Are you okay?

227
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:08,880
I'll check that side.

228
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,590
Dad...

229
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:15,261
-Get up.
-Have some water.

230
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,388
He's bleeding!

231
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:21,601
They've disconnected the emergency brakes.

232
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:25,104
We can't stop the train.

233
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:27,982
-Ahaana.
-Ahaana! She'd gone to the washroom.

234
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:30,151
Look for her.

235
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,903
We'll go and check.

236
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:34,781
-But you all need to get out of here.
-I'll help you up.

237
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:36,157
Let's go.

238
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:38,284
Come on.

239
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:39,660
Mom...

240
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:52,548
Ahaana?

241
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:54,425
Ahaana?

242
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:56,803
I'll look that side.

243
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:59,806
Mom, she came this way.
I'll go ahead and check.

244
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:02,725
-Let me look...
-Mom, you go on with Dad.

245
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:03,810
-Come.
-Let's go!

246
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:05,728
Uncle!

247
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:06,813
Pick him up.

248
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:09,774
-Hey, move!
-Pick him up.

249
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:11,067
Be careful.

250
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:12,693
Amrit.

251
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,822
Go with them.
And don't sit together.

252
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:16,948
No--

253
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:18,491
No one's seen you
besides those two, Tuli.

254
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,451
Amrit, come with us.

255
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,411
I'll be fine. I swear.

256
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:24,205
-I'll be right there.
-Amrit...

257
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,289
Go!

258
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:26,874
Just go.

259
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,293
I'll be right there.

260
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,600
You shouldn't have killed him, bro.

261
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,853
We could've contained him.
It's a huge mess now.

262
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:49,981
It was a split-second decision.
He would have killed Tulika's mom.

263
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,278
They put a knife through him.

264
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:57,905
Dad.

265
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:00,575
Dad!

266
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:03,744
What will I tell Mom?

267
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,747
We have to inform Beni.

268
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:13,129
We get off in 10 minutes
and meet him.

269
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,505
How can we just leave, Uncle?

270
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:16,966
They will have to pay for this.

271
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:18,509
He was our uncle, after all.

272
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,636
We'll look this side,
you guys check that way.

273
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,597
We won't spare anyone!

274
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:24,265
He was Beni's brother!

275
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:25,892
No!

276
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:29,020
Not a word to Dad.

277
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:34,025
And no one will touch those bastards.

278
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:37,028
Only Ravi has the right to avenge
his dad's death.

279
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:41,616
Let's find Baldeo Singh Thakur
to pay for this sin.

280
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:47,914
I won't spare them.

281
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:49,874
Let's go!

282
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,672
Sarju!

283
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:55,231
Fuckers, stop!

284
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:59,110
Or else I'll slay the kid.

285
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:02,738
-Dad!
-Where's Thakur?

286
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,118
Where is Baldeo Singh Thakur?

287
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:10,663
Let the kid go.

288
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:13,958
Let's discuss this calmly--

289
00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:15,710
Viresh!

290
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:18,713
Move your ass!

291
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,389
Bastard!

292
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:44,613
You killed my dad.

293
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:46,532
I won't spare you!

294
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:45,091
Amrit?

295
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:48,010
What happened?

296
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:50,971
Those bastards took Viresh.

297
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,431
What?

298
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,438
-Amrit, I can't find Ahaana--
-Tulika--

299
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:15,079
Let go of me. Untie me!

300
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:29,593
You won't get away with this.

301
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:32,763
Your partner's on his way to hell.

302
00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:35,015
You're set to follow soon.

303
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:37,768
How many in your gang?

304
00:24:38,394 --> 00:24:40,354
-And which coaches are they in?
-Fuck off!

305
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,775
You're still alive because
we're here.

306
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:48,279
If I'd met you on the battlefield,
I'd bury you alive.

307
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:50,990
If I let go for even a second,

308
00:24:51,782 --> 00:24:53,367
you'll lose your legs.

309
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,412
You won't die.

310
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,539
Just no legs!

311
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:04,545
Tell me.

312
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:09,508
B1, A1, A2, and A3.

313
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,302
There are 36 bandits.

314
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:13,179
They've blocked all four coaches.

315
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:15,639
Ahaana isn't here.
She's not in A2 either.

316
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,768
Could she have gone the other way?

317
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,773
Sit down!

318
00:25:38,913 --> 00:25:39,914
Move!

319
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:48,339
Where's Ravi?

320
00:25:51,342 --> 00:25:52,801
Where the hell is he?

321
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:07,650
Yes?

322
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:12,696
What?

323
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:18,077
Siddhi!

324
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:33,884
The train's slowing down.

325
00:26:40,391 --> 00:26:41,392
Let me go!

326
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:32,901
Brother-in-law...

327
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:47,333
Who did this?

328
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:18,113
Where's the gun? Give it to me!

329
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:19,490
It won't work.
I've fired from this already.

330
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:21,367
-I don't care--
-These country-made guns can backfire!

331
00:28:21,492 --> 00:28:22,493
Brother!

332
00:28:22,743 --> 00:28:24,495
Ravi isn't here. They've got him.

333
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:26,121
That's why I brought him here.

334
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:32,628
We need Ravi back.

335
00:28:34,004 --> 00:28:37,132
And the guy who did this to Babban.

336
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,510
Baldeo Singh Thakur.

337
00:28:41,512 --> 00:28:43,013
Owner of Shanti Transport.

338
00:28:43,764 --> 00:28:45,140
What rubbish!

339
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:46,392
I'm telling the truth.

340
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:48,394
Your brother was my uncle.

341
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:51,021
Baldeo Singh Thakur is the reason
he's dead.

342
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:54,900
You can ask Ravi.

343
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:03,409
This guy has a partner.

344
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:07,037
The way they've been fighting...

345
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:08,664
I'm sure they're from the army.

346
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,417
To catch them, think like Dhoni.

347
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:14,294
-Dhoni?
-Mahendra.

348
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:16,922
Lower your guard.

349
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:20,551
The moment he charges to attack,
deliver your punch. Knockout!

350
00:29:35,816 --> 00:29:38,193
Careful there, brother!

351
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:42,197
-You go that way.
-Be careful!

352
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:45,200
-Careful!
-Move ahead.

353
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:47,202
Okay.

354
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:03,469
Let me go!

355
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:13,979
Just in case.

356
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:17,483
What do you mean?

357
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:20,486
Are you worried about me?

358
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:22,488
It's not safe, Tulika.

359
00:30:28,619 --> 00:30:30,746
The only thing that should matter is,

360
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:34,374
starting tomorrow, I'll be your wife.

361
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:37,252
I'm warning you,

362
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:39,505
I'm very demanding.

363
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:57,773
Amrit, please bring Ahaana back.

364
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:00,526
She's my life.

365
00:31:01,527 --> 00:31:03,529
I'll bring Ahaana back.

366
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:05,030
I promise.

367
00:34:21,852 --> 00:34:23,228
Is he in the Army?

368
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:29,609
A National Security Guard Commando.

369
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,487
Why didn't you tell me about him?

370
00:34:36,867 --> 00:34:38,493
What good would that do?

371
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:41,997
I got engaged with
whoever you chose, didn't I?

372
00:34:42,873 --> 00:34:46,126
If father-daughter are done
with suitor shopping,

373
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:47,377
then help me in.

374
00:34:47,461 --> 00:34:48,503
My foot is slipping.

375
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:50,505
I'd rather throw you on the tracks.

376
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:53,383
Shut up and stay there!

377
00:36:01,952 --> 00:36:02,953
Hold him.

378
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:05,247
Keep an eye on him.

379
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:37,863
-Sohail!
-Sohail!

380
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:44,870
Arif!

381
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:48,498
Arif! Stop! Arif, don't do this!

382
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:50,876
Hey, let go!

383
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:02,012
Hold his hand.

384
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,280
Arif!

385
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:23,992
You stabbed him! Arif!

386
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:25,368
My child!

387
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:29,539
Catch him!

388
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:31,291
Nobody moves.

389
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:34,044
Someone help him.

390
00:37:37,047 --> 00:37:38,048
Thrash him!

391
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:08,328
Arif, open your eyes.

392
00:38:08,578 --> 00:38:11,206
Arif!

393
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:39,734
We meet again!

394
00:40:05,695 --> 00:40:06,696
Are you okay?

395
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,198
Yeah. Shit!

396
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:10,700
It's looking bad, bro!

397
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:17,582
Come on. Get up. Up!

398
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,837
You're not holding the weapon right.

399
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:29,344
You'll twist your delicate wrist.

400
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:32,472
A weapon is also called
an arm for a reason.

401
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:34,724
Treat it as an extension of you.
Show it some love.

402
00:40:36,226 --> 00:40:38,978
The arm stays flexible
and the wrist must be...

403
00:40:39,729 --> 00:40:40,730
Firm!

404
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:44,984
One hit at the jugular and...

405
00:40:47,237 --> 00:40:49,364
Game over!

406
00:40:51,241 --> 00:40:53,618
I speak from experience.
I'll teach you.

407
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:56,246
Take the key! Get out of here.

408
00:40:56,329 --> 00:40:57,747
Hurry! Be careful!

409
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:04,129
Running away and leaving your Dad behind?

410
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,137
Why don't you call the cops now?

411
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:14,139
Where are your cops? Call them now!

412
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:39,414
Tulika!

413
00:41:54,554 --> 00:41:56,306
Let me go!

414
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:02,687
Hey, pretty girl!

415
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:05,940
What's your problem?

416
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:11,321
You're no soldier, Miss.

417
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:16,701
He is, though!

418
00:42:17,827 --> 00:42:20,205
But considering the situation...

419
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:22,957
it doesn't seem likely that
he'll be able to save you.

420
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:24,959
That won't be necessary.

421
00:42:25,585 --> 00:42:26,961
Bravo!

422
00:42:27,337 --> 00:42:28,713
Let's have some fun!

423
00:42:31,841 --> 00:42:35,094
Didn't I tell you not to--

424
00:42:45,855 --> 00:42:46,856
Tulika!

425
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:49,359
Tulika!

426
00:43:08,503 --> 00:43:09,879
Tuli!

427
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:13,883
You've got some balls!

428
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:22,141
Amrit...

429
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:32,777
Amrit...

430
00:43:56,259 --> 00:43:59,971
No! Tulika!

431
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:36,234
-Where's dad?
-In B1.

432
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:38,444
We're getting off in five minutes.
Get dad and pack everything.

433
00:45:38,528 --> 00:45:39,529
-Alright.
-Uncle!

434
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:41,614
Bring his family.

435
00:45:44,492 --> 00:45:47,245
Come on. Get moving!

436
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:49,997
Uncle? Hurry up!

437
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:51,874
There's no time to waste.

438
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:58,881
Get up.

439
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:00,508
And throw them off.

440
00:46:25,283 --> 00:46:26,701
Happy fourth anniversary!

441
00:46:32,832 --> 00:46:34,459
How do you remember every year?

442
00:46:35,084 --> 00:46:36,586
That's because I love you more.

443
00:46:37,295 --> 00:46:39,922
"I love you more!" Rubbish!
Show me your hands.

444
00:46:40,298 --> 00:46:41,424
My hands?

445
00:46:41,674 --> 00:46:42,842
-Yes! Show them.
-Here you go.

446
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:45,303
All yours!

447
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:47,054
Amrit.

448
00:46:49,682 --> 00:46:53,311
Look, you have a proper crescent moon.

449
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:55,855
Which means, I love you more.

450
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:00,943
But your lifeline seems longer.

451
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:02,069
See?

452
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:17,960
I am joining our lifelines together.

453
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:21,964
Now we share only one life.

454
00:47:36,896 --> 00:47:38,356
Bechan!

455
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:28,447
Stay back!

456
00:48:42,545 --> 00:48:44,422
Let me go Fani!

457
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:46,841
-Let's get out.
-I won't spare you.

458
00:49:30,635 --> 00:49:32,219
Hold him up.

459
00:49:48,611 --> 00:49:49,987
Stop him!

460
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:59,413
What are you waiting for? Go!

461
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:18,265
Stop or I'll kill--

462
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:19,684
-Uncle!
-Uncle!

463
00:51:25,833 --> 00:51:29,086
Get the other bags.
Quick! We have to get off.

464
00:51:32,006 --> 00:51:33,090
Uncle...

465
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:39,013
They killed Dad!

466
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:43,851
Fucking hell!

467
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:49,482
That Commando's love
has fallen on us like a bomb.

468
00:51:50,274 --> 00:51:51,859
He's killing everyone.

469
00:51:53,736 --> 00:51:55,488
What do you mean?

470
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:57,615
They are family, Fani.

471
00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:00,743
Exactly why I saved him
and brought him back.

472
00:52:02,787 --> 00:52:05,164
Wonder why everyone
is a fountain of love today?

473
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,377
Why the hell did you kill that girl?

474
00:52:10,628 --> 00:52:11,879
Tell me!

475
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:15,132
I didn't want to dance around trees
with her.

476
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:17,635
I was going to ransom her.

477
00:52:17,718 --> 00:52:19,553
She was challenging me.
Sliced my arm.

478
00:52:19,637 --> 00:52:20,638
So, I killed her.

479
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:24,266
Do you have any idea what you've done?

480
00:52:24,517 --> 00:52:26,560
Do you realize whose daughter she was?

481
00:52:27,019 --> 00:52:29,104
Uncle, these guys aren't regular soldiers.

482
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:30,564
They're commandos.

483
00:52:30,815 --> 00:52:32,316
We're not safe on the train.

484
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:34,026
You think we're safe outside?

485
00:52:34,276 --> 00:52:35,986
Baldeo Singh Thakur will spare us?

486
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:38,531
He killed his daughter!

487
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:50,167
We can't leave any of them alive now.

488
00:52:50,793 --> 00:52:52,920
We have to kill them all. Get it--

489
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:55,172
No one will touch Baldeo Singh Thakur.

490
00:52:55,256 --> 00:52:57,842
Screw your ideas!

491
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:00,094
At least listen to my golden words.

492
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:01,804
How much worse do you want it to be?

493
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:04,431
The Goddess of Wealth is shining
Her golden light at us.

494
00:53:04,515 --> 00:53:05,808
And you do not want to see it!

495
00:53:06,934 --> 00:53:09,854
Kidnap his family. Ask him for ransom.
And then kill them all.

496
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:11,814
How many of us will you get killed?

497
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:13,065
Exactly my point!

498
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:15,693
What will you give to the families
who've died today?

499
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:22,074
How will our own people survive, Dad?

500
00:53:26,579 --> 00:53:29,915
Baldeo Singh Thakur
is the root cause of all this.

501
00:53:32,376 --> 00:53:34,837
He must pay!

502
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:50,603
The commandos were in B1, right?

503
00:53:50,978 --> 00:53:51,979
Yes.

504
00:54:01,614 --> 00:54:02,615
Easy there.

505
00:54:05,117 --> 00:54:06,869
I'll get the first aid box.

506
00:54:13,125 --> 00:54:15,419
Did you find Ahaana?

507
00:54:16,128 --> 00:54:17,755
Where is she?

508
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:19,798
What took you so long, Baldeo?

509
00:54:19,882 --> 00:54:21,759
-What happened to Ahaana?
-Where are the kids?

510
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:25,512
Say something.

511
00:54:25,888 --> 00:54:27,890
Why are you crying?

512
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:30,643
Tulika was with you. Where is she?

513
00:54:30,893 --> 00:54:32,269
Why won't you say anything?

514
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:33,938
Where is Tulika?

515
00:54:35,397 --> 00:54:36,899
They killed Tulika.

516
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:38,651
What?

517
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:42,529
Killed?

518
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:44,907
Who killed her?

519
00:54:45,032 --> 00:54:47,451
-That can't be!
-I don't believe you!

520
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:50,454
They just...

521
00:54:50,955 --> 00:54:55,167
They pushed her off the train!

522
00:55:05,928 --> 00:55:07,846
She was in pink.

523
00:55:09,682 --> 00:55:10,933
No! My child!

524
00:55:11,058 --> 00:55:12,559
Everything turned red.

525
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:14,937
My baby!

526
00:55:15,062 --> 00:55:16,438
Red!

527
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:18,232
Tulika.

528
00:55:57,146 --> 00:55:59,314
Please find Ahaana and get her back.

529
00:56:00,399 --> 00:56:01,900
She is my life.

530
00:56:04,528 --> 00:56:06,363
I'll get Ahaana back.

531
00:56:08,282 --> 00:56:10,034
I promise.

532
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:45,819
What are you doing?

533
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:47,196
I need to go.

534
00:56:47,696 --> 00:56:50,199
We're greatly outnumbered here.

535
00:56:50,741 --> 00:56:52,576
They're going to get off
at the next station anyway.

536
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:56,705
I promised her

537
00:56:58,082 --> 00:56:59,833
that I'd bring Ahaana back.

538
00:57:00,709 --> 00:57:02,711
If they find out she's Tulika's sister,

539
00:57:03,212 --> 00:57:04,755
they won't spare her.

540
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:06,715
Let's go then.

541
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:08,717
-I'm coming along.
-Viresh!

542
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:10,219
You're in no condition to fight.

543
00:57:10,344 --> 00:57:12,471
-I don't care, I'm coming along.
-Listen to me!

544
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:14,473
They need you here.

545
00:57:14,723 --> 00:57:16,350
-But--
-Just listen to me.

546
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:18,852
I've already lost Tuli.

547
00:57:20,771 --> 00:57:22,231
I don't want to lose you.

548
00:57:27,778 --> 00:57:29,613
They'll get off this train for sure

549
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:32,866
but only for their funeral.

550
00:57:36,912 --> 00:57:39,289
Speak! Where are the commandos?

551
00:57:39,748 --> 00:57:40,749
Move it!

552
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:44,503
Bastard, who are they with?

553
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:46,630
How would I know?

554
00:57:52,511 --> 00:57:53,804
You don't know?

555
00:57:56,765 --> 00:58:00,644
Who's with them?
Mother? Father?

556
00:58:10,404 --> 00:58:12,406
-Tell me!
-I don't know anything!

557
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:13,615
Fani!

558
00:58:17,661 --> 00:58:19,037
We're wasting time.

559
00:58:24,293 --> 00:58:25,586
Bastards...

560
00:59:05,584 --> 00:59:07,336
Please!

561
00:59:07,586 --> 00:59:09,463
We've managed to escape the bandits.

562
00:59:09,588 --> 00:59:12,341
Please let us go.
They'll kill us otherwise.

563
00:59:12,466 --> 00:59:13,967
-Please let us go ahead.
-Please.

564
00:59:36,865 --> 00:59:38,116
Where's dad?

565
00:59:40,369 --> 00:59:41,620
He isn't back?

566
00:59:55,634 --> 00:59:56,677
Hey! What are you hiding?

567
00:59:58,512 --> 00:59:59,513
Get back.

568
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:20,158
No, please!

569
01:00:20,534 --> 01:00:22,286
Tell that father of yours,

570
01:00:22,411 --> 01:00:23,537
I'm coming for him.

571
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:33,297
Ranjan!

572
01:00:33,672 --> 01:00:35,173
-Make space.
-Ranjan.

573
01:00:35,674 --> 01:00:36,800
Ranjan. What happened?

574
01:00:36,925 --> 01:00:38,302
Lay him down.

575
01:00:38,427 --> 01:00:39,553
Get aside.

576
01:00:39,678 --> 01:00:41,179
-Ranjan!
-Get some water.

577
01:00:41,305 --> 01:00:42,306
Ranjan!

578
01:00:43,557 --> 01:00:45,934
That Commando...

579
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:49,187
he's coming for you.

580
01:00:49,688 --> 01:00:51,565
-It's okay, take it easy.
-You relax.

581
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:53,066
Ranjan!

582
01:00:53,191 --> 01:00:55,193
Ranjan! No!

583
01:00:55,444 --> 01:00:56,778
-Ranjan!
-Ranjan!

584
01:00:58,655 --> 01:00:59,781
-Ranjan!
-Ranjan!

585
01:01:04,828 --> 01:01:06,747
You started this mess.

586
01:01:07,956 --> 01:01:09,708
And we've to pay the price.

587
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,336
We're not going to fight them.

588
01:01:12,836 --> 01:01:14,087
We want to get off this train.

589
01:01:14,254 --> 01:01:16,590
What the fuck did you say?
You want to get off?

590
01:01:17,007 --> 01:01:19,134
My father's still with them.

591
01:01:19,217 --> 01:01:21,470
Are you blind? Ranjan returned alone.

592
01:01:23,013 --> 01:01:24,723
He must be dead already.

593
01:01:30,604 --> 01:01:33,231
-Because of you!
-Stop it!

594
01:01:38,278 --> 01:01:39,738
Enough!

595
01:01:44,284 --> 01:01:45,494
Let go of me.

596
01:01:46,995 --> 01:01:49,247
What's this drama about?

597
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:51,792
Bunch of fucking cowards!

598
01:01:52,292 --> 01:01:53,752
Cribbing away to glory.

599
01:01:54,753 --> 01:01:56,755
If you don't have the balls to fight...

600
01:01:57,005 --> 01:01:59,383
then sit at home
and give instructions.

601
01:01:59,633 --> 01:02:01,259
You don't deserve to be bandits.

602
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:03,136
We want to get off. That's it!

603
01:02:03,512 --> 01:02:05,555
I'm with him.

604
01:02:05,764 --> 01:02:07,015
You want to leave?

605
01:02:07,307 --> 01:02:08,308
Let's do it.

606
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:10,769
Let's get off!

607
01:02:11,144 --> 01:02:12,729
Do you think you'll be safe then?

608
01:02:14,773 --> 01:02:17,818
Baldeo Singh Thakur is just
another passenger on the train.

609
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:21,029
Helpless. Vulnerable. Powerless.

610
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:22,823
But if he gets off this train,

611
01:02:24,282 --> 01:02:27,160
he'll make sure
to get every last one of us killed.

612
01:02:27,911 --> 01:02:29,037
Still want to leave?

613
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:34,668
Let's move on.

614
01:02:35,043 --> 01:02:36,545
I won't walk in the front.

615
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:38,046
You lead.

616
01:03:59,586 --> 01:04:00,837
Move it. Go!

617
01:04:00,962 --> 01:04:02,214
Keep walking!

618
01:04:02,464 --> 01:04:03,632
You stay back.

619
01:04:03,715 --> 01:04:04,716
Go on!

620
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:06,593
Keep moving.

621
01:04:07,219 --> 01:04:09,596
Walk! Move ahead!

622
01:04:09,888 --> 01:04:10,889
Come on!

623
01:04:13,975 --> 01:04:15,352
Ravi, what happened?

624
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:18,104
Badlu...

625
01:04:18,605 --> 01:04:19,731
Uncle!

626
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:21,733
Uncle, come here!

627
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:23,485
-Badri!
-Fani!

628
01:04:24,361 --> 01:04:26,238
-Uncle!
-Make way.

629
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:51,888
No!

630
01:04:52,389 --> 01:04:53,640
Bring him here!

631
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:55,016
Move it. Go!

632
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:00,146
Keep walking!

633
01:05:01,273 --> 01:05:02,274
Sarju!

634
01:05:03,775 --> 01:05:04,776
Murari!

635
01:05:10,532 --> 01:05:12,784
Bechan!

636
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:13,910
Badlu!

637
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:16,037
Get him down.

638
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:21,042
Get him down.

639
01:05:21,418 --> 01:05:22,419
Murari!

640
01:05:22,627 --> 01:05:24,170
Hold him! Get him down!

641
01:05:24,546 --> 01:05:27,549
Get him down.
Let's bring Bilas down.

642
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:31,303
Bechan! Badlu!

643
01:05:34,806 --> 01:05:35,932
Bilas!

644
01:05:36,057 --> 01:05:37,434
Get him down.

645
01:05:42,814 --> 01:05:44,566
Get him down.

646
01:05:52,198 --> 01:05:53,199
Dad!

647
01:05:56,077 --> 01:05:57,078
Dad!

648
01:06:02,709 --> 01:06:03,710
Dad!

649
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:09,090
Untie him.

650
01:06:10,717 --> 01:06:12,218
Hold him up.

651
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:16,222
Dad!

652
01:06:16,473 --> 01:06:18,099
Fani!

653
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:20,769
Pull yourself together.

654
01:06:20,852 --> 01:06:23,104
They killed Dad.

655
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:00,386
Siddhi!

656
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:02,263
Siddhi, don't.

657
01:09:02,514 --> 01:09:04,015
-Move aside, Uncle.
-Don't.

658
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:06,142
Move aside, I'll--

659
01:09:07,018 --> 01:09:09,854
I'll tear them apart!

660
01:09:10,772 --> 01:09:13,316
I know you can.
But understand this.

661
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:17,028
They've put up this display to rattle us.

662
01:09:17,654 --> 01:09:21,157
They're lurking nearby for us
to fall into their trap.

663
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:25,286
Siddhi, we'll take our revenge.

664
01:09:25,537 --> 01:09:26,663
Do you hear me?

665
01:09:27,413 --> 01:09:28,790
Get a grip.

666
01:09:29,916 --> 01:09:32,669
We will avenge him. Okay.

667
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:41,052
Bloody...

668
01:09:41,928 --> 01:09:43,346
Listen.

669
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:46,432
No more of your stunts. Got it?

670
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:48,434
No more nonsense.

671
01:09:48,810 --> 01:09:49,811
Where is it?

672
01:09:50,311 --> 01:09:53,189
Where is this maternal love
coming from?

673
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:56,192
Why don't you put me
back in a cradle?

674
01:09:56,693 --> 01:09:59,070
You'll get everyone killed.

675
01:09:59,571 --> 01:10:03,324
We've had differences
for the first time in 30 years.

676
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:06,202
You've pissed on all my principles.

677
01:10:11,583 --> 01:10:13,710
Foster a dog or a cat,

678
01:10:14,335 --> 01:10:16,337
but don't foster misconceptions, Dad.

679
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:18,840
You are not a Spider-man or Batman.

680
01:10:18,923 --> 01:10:21,843
"With great power comes
great responsibility."

681
01:10:21,926 --> 01:10:24,929
We are bandits. We are thieves.

682
01:10:25,471 --> 01:10:27,181
Our entire extended family.

683
01:10:29,851 --> 01:10:32,228
Sacrifice and principles, my ass.

684
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:02,634
Have you seen a young girl here?
Around 15-16 years old?

685
01:11:12,393 --> 01:11:13,978
You're here. Where is Sohail?

686
01:11:15,146 --> 01:11:16,272
Sohail's safe.

687
01:11:16,356 --> 01:11:17,607
He's in A3 ahead.

688
01:11:18,524 --> 01:11:19,776
Viresh is with him.

689
01:11:22,528 --> 01:11:23,780
Don't worry.

690
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:31,287
I'm looking for a 15-16 years old girl.

691
01:11:31,579 --> 01:11:33,289
Have any of you seen her?

692
01:11:33,414 --> 01:11:34,415
Yes.

693
01:11:34,916 --> 01:11:36,042
There was one.

694
01:11:36,542 --> 01:11:38,836
But the bandits took her

695
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:41,673
along with a few others to another coach.

696
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:50,056
Get out of this coach. Hurry.

697
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:52,058
Clear out. Come on, get up.

698
01:11:53,935 --> 01:11:55,937
-Move ahead.
-Let's go.

699
01:12:04,195 --> 01:12:05,947
Careful... hurry!

700
01:12:08,449 --> 01:12:09,701
Leave the bag!

701
01:12:10,576 --> 01:12:11,577
Sit down!

702
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:14,330
Didn't you hear me?

703
01:12:14,455 --> 01:12:15,832
Where are you going?

704
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,362
We also want to come with you.

705
01:12:52,618 --> 01:12:54,120
It's too risky.

706
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:55,872
They're capable of anything.

707
01:12:55,997 --> 01:12:59,250
It may even get beyond me.
Please understand.

708
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:00,626
It's okay.

709
01:13:00,877 --> 01:13:03,880
We didn't do anything
thinking it wasn't our fight.

710
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:07,759
If we'd all helped you from the start
then perhaps Arif--

711
01:13:08,259 --> 01:13:09,635
I'll come too.

712
01:13:14,057 --> 01:13:15,308
Don't go by my physique.

713
01:13:15,892 --> 01:13:17,518
I can be very helpful.

714
01:13:36,037 --> 01:13:39,165
Fire!

715
01:13:40,041 --> 01:13:41,542
Sir, the train is on fire.

716
01:13:45,546 --> 01:13:47,298
Who the hell!

717
01:13:50,885 --> 01:13:51,886
Hello?

718
01:13:53,971 --> 01:13:55,973
Fire? On this train?

719
01:14:01,187 --> 01:14:02,939
Who put the lock here?

720
01:14:10,071 --> 01:14:11,739
Seems like the fire was here.

721
01:14:17,954 --> 01:14:20,206
What a bummer!
No one saw the fire.

722
01:14:23,709 --> 01:14:25,670
The police are here!

723
01:14:26,379 --> 01:14:28,005
Thank God!

724
01:14:34,971 --> 01:14:36,973
Those assholes locked it and ran away.

725
01:14:45,606 --> 01:14:47,483
We're arriving at a station, Uncle.

726
01:14:50,987 --> 01:14:53,865
Siddhi, check the coach.

727
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:55,867
Get all our things

728
01:14:56,367 --> 01:14:58,744
and make sure
you gather all of our people.

729
01:15:01,998 --> 01:15:05,877
Fani, check the other coach.

730
01:15:06,252 --> 01:15:08,629
If you find Baldeo Singh Thakur,
finish him off.

731
01:15:08,713 --> 01:15:10,339
-Thakur--
-No arguments!

732
01:15:11,632 --> 01:15:14,635
Pull the emergency brakes. Do it!

733
01:15:24,145 --> 01:15:26,522
Shut the doors.

734
01:15:34,655 --> 01:15:36,157
Get off.

735
01:15:38,284 --> 01:15:39,785
Worried about me, are you?

736
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:43,289
Your fatherly love
has finally blossomed today.

737
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:44,624
Hey!

738
01:15:51,797 --> 01:15:53,049
Run! Run!

739
01:15:59,180 --> 01:16:01,557
That guy in the light shirt.

740
01:16:01,682 --> 01:16:02,808
He's their leader!

741
01:16:06,938 --> 01:16:07,939
Police!

742
01:16:15,446 --> 01:16:16,822
The police are here.

743
01:16:33,089 --> 01:16:34,840
The train has picked up speed.

744
01:16:35,633 --> 01:16:38,094
The police must've informed
at the next station.

745
01:16:38,970 --> 01:16:40,846
Why are we getting involved
with the police?

746
01:16:41,097 --> 01:16:42,098
We won't.

747
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:46,727
Get here!

748
01:16:52,108 --> 01:16:54,235
These guys will face the cops.

749
01:17:18,217 --> 01:17:19,969
No! Natthu!

750
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:35,151
It'll come in handy.

751
01:17:38,321 --> 01:17:39,864
Let's throw these two out.

752
01:19:23,717 --> 01:19:25,094
Why?

753
01:19:25,970 --> 01:19:27,680
Why did you kill my dad?

754
01:19:28,848 --> 01:19:30,850
Why did you kill my dad?

755
01:20:07,636 --> 01:20:09,054
Why?

756
01:20:09,138 --> 01:20:11,390
Why did you kill my son?

757
01:20:11,474 --> 01:20:13,434
Why? Why?

758
01:20:22,485 --> 01:20:24,737
Why did you kill my child?

759
01:20:27,490 --> 01:20:28,866
Arif!

760
01:20:36,874 --> 01:20:38,876
What's taking Siddhi so long?

761
01:20:39,126 --> 01:20:40,503
I'll check.

762
01:20:42,129 --> 01:20:43,881
Wait a minute.

763
01:20:44,507 --> 01:20:46,133
Don't open the shutter yet.

764
01:20:47,927 --> 01:20:49,303
Uncle!

765
01:20:50,387 --> 01:20:52,264
Uncle! Uncle.

766
01:20:54,892 --> 01:20:58,145
-Uncle... My brother... Siddhi...
-What happened?

767
01:20:59,146 --> 01:21:00,898
-Siddhi...
-What happened to him?

768
01:21:08,030 --> 01:21:10,324
Come with me. Hold her here.

769
01:21:10,616 --> 01:21:12,117
Hold her.

770
01:21:45,818 --> 01:21:47,111
Uncle...

771
01:21:55,077 --> 01:21:56,328
Move!

772
01:22:07,464 --> 01:22:09,216
Take the passengers and move forward.

773
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:10,342
We fucked up.

774
01:22:11,844 --> 01:22:13,721
We should've gotten off with Fani.

775
01:22:17,850 --> 01:22:19,602
You ensured he's safe.

776
01:22:19,768 --> 01:22:23,230
Uncle, let's get off.

777
01:22:28,402 --> 01:22:29,820
I agree.

778
01:22:33,407 --> 01:22:34,825
Even I think so.

779
01:22:35,618 --> 01:22:36,744
Please listen to us.

780
01:22:37,244 --> 01:22:38,871
Let's get off.

781
01:22:45,878 --> 01:22:48,130
Uncle, we should get off.

782
01:22:48,631 --> 01:22:50,132
Uncle!

783
01:22:55,387 --> 01:22:56,639
Come! Walk ahead.

784
01:22:57,014 --> 01:22:58,140
Move!

785
01:22:59,308 --> 01:23:02,019
-All of you. Move!
-Keep walking!

786
01:23:16,283 --> 01:23:17,660
Walk ahead.

787
01:23:18,410 --> 01:23:19,912
Come out!

788
01:23:20,162 --> 01:23:23,040
Or else we'll kill
every last one of them.

789
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:29,463
Come out now.

790
01:23:37,846 --> 01:23:39,306
Stay right there.

791
01:23:39,807 --> 01:23:41,058
Not a step!

792
01:23:41,308 --> 01:23:44,311
Or I'll carve him like a turkey.

793
01:24:03,956 --> 01:24:05,958
-Dad!
-Ahaana!

794
01:24:09,712 --> 01:24:11,088
Bring him here.

795
01:24:12,089 --> 01:24:13,424
Easy.

796
01:24:13,841 --> 01:24:15,384
Sit!

797
01:24:17,344 --> 01:24:19,346
You need to lie down.
Don't get up, please.

798
01:24:19,471 --> 01:24:21,348
-You've lost a lot of blood.
-Amrit...

799
01:24:21,598 --> 01:24:23,350
-Please lie down.
-The police are here.

800
01:24:23,434 --> 01:24:25,853
The police are with us.
Please don't get up.

801
01:24:27,604 --> 01:24:28,772
I'm back!

802
01:24:28,856 --> 01:24:30,733
Drop your weapons!

803
01:24:40,659 --> 01:24:42,244
Stand back.

804
01:24:42,870 --> 01:24:47,249
What a dumb fuck! Asked me to drop
my weapon. And it dropped on his skull!

805
01:24:47,332 --> 01:24:48,959
How tragic.

806
01:24:51,378 --> 01:24:54,757
Look! Happy days are here again.

807
01:24:57,259 --> 01:25:00,387
Dad's other li'l princess, isn't it?

808
01:25:01,388 --> 01:25:03,390
Kill one and another appears.

809
01:25:03,515 --> 01:25:05,517
-Baldeo, you are a magician!
-Killed?

810
01:25:08,270 --> 01:25:09,271
Dad?

811
01:25:12,149 --> 01:25:13,275
Tuli?

812
01:25:15,527 --> 01:25:17,780
No, no, no, no. Dad!

813
01:25:18,030 --> 01:25:19,907
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

814
01:25:36,298 --> 01:25:37,299
Run!

815
01:25:37,424 --> 01:25:38,801
Uncle!

816
01:25:41,428 --> 01:25:42,846
Come here.

817
01:25:43,472 --> 01:25:44,848
Uncle!

818
01:25:44,932 --> 01:25:46,517
I'm okay.

819
01:25:47,559 --> 01:25:49,436
Stop!

820
01:25:54,316 --> 01:25:55,818
Where did the prick go?

821
01:26:16,088 --> 01:26:17,506
Show yourself!

822
01:26:18,298 --> 01:26:19,800
Come out!

823
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:47,119
Soldier sir! Please save me!

824
01:26:59,006 --> 01:27:00,257
Ravi!

825
01:27:00,757 --> 01:27:01,758
Uncle.

826
01:27:04,761 --> 01:27:07,014
Stop. Hold it!

827
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:11,518
Uncle, gunshots were fired
in the next coach.

828
01:27:12,144 --> 01:27:13,270
It must be the police.

829
01:27:14,146 --> 01:27:15,522
Let's not kill him.

830
01:27:15,898 --> 01:27:17,649
We can use him as bait.

831
01:27:24,907 --> 01:27:26,533
Move back.

832
01:27:32,039 --> 01:27:37,169
Little soldier boy.
A broken soldier toy! Soldier!

833
01:27:58,315 --> 01:27:59,816
Don't let them escape.

834
01:29:04,881 --> 01:29:06,008
Fucking hell!

835
01:29:06,133 --> 01:29:07,134
Come on, walk!

836
01:29:07,217 --> 01:29:10,762
We're arriving at a station. Hurry up!

837
01:29:10,887 --> 01:29:11,888
Come on!

838
01:29:12,264 --> 01:29:15,767
Hold him tight!
You don't know him well.

839
01:29:16,268 --> 01:29:20,647
He was trying very hard to be a Rambo.

840
01:29:22,065 --> 01:29:24,317
I sat him in my lap
and bled him to death.

841
01:29:25,902 --> 01:29:27,612
It was beautiful!

842
01:29:28,071 --> 01:29:31,116
Didn't ask his name,
tell me yours before you die.

843
01:29:32,409 --> 01:29:35,412
Soldier? Hear me, soldier?

844
01:29:35,871 --> 01:29:37,289
Fani!

845
01:29:38,165 --> 01:29:39,791
You haven't killed him?

846
01:29:40,584 --> 01:29:42,210
Nope, I didn't.

847
01:29:42,294 --> 01:29:44,046
What's your name?

848
01:29:45,922 --> 01:29:49,676
-What's the problem?
-Didn't I tell you to kill him?

849
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:52,054
Let go of me!
We can't keep him alive!

850
01:29:52,179 --> 01:29:53,847
Sometimes you're stubborn like a child.

851
01:29:53,930 --> 01:29:54,931
We can't keep him alive!

852
01:29:55,015 --> 01:29:56,683
Or we won't survive.

853
01:29:56,933 --> 01:29:58,685
-What do you need...
-What kind of father are you?

854
01:29:58,769 --> 01:30:00,937
-You're making things worse.
-You never agree with me.

855
01:30:01,021 --> 01:30:02,564
Baldeo will make our life hell.

856
01:30:22,709 --> 01:30:24,336
Soldier, no!

857
01:30:30,842 --> 01:30:32,385
Uncle!

858
01:30:32,719 --> 01:30:34,721
Don't let them go!

859
01:30:36,098 --> 01:30:38,600
Uncle!

860
01:30:41,853 --> 01:30:43,855
Dad!

861
01:30:43,980 --> 01:30:47,359
Dad!

862
01:30:47,734 --> 01:30:51,238
Get water!

863
01:30:52,114 --> 01:30:53,824
Dad! Dad!

864
01:30:59,746 --> 01:31:01,206
Dad!

865
01:31:01,748 --> 01:31:02,999
How badly he's burnt!

866
01:31:03,625 --> 01:31:04,751
Look at his face...

867
01:31:17,639 --> 01:31:19,015
Bloody hell!

868
01:31:48,295 --> 01:31:50,046
Get up. Let's go!

869
01:31:58,263 --> 01:31:59,431
Okay, go!

870
01:32:41,139 --> 01:32:43,141
Who kills like this?

871
01:32:45,477 --> 01:32:48,021
I killed four of your people.

872
01:32:49,606 --> 01:32:52,359
You finished off 40 of my family!

873
01:32:54,861 --> 01:32:56,821
You're not a protector.

874
01:32:59,366 --> 01:33:01,493
You're a monster.
A fucking monster!

875
01:33:15,298 --> 01:33:18,760
Commando! Are you still a trainee?

876
01:33:20,303 --> 01:33:22,806
You can barely keep up with me.

877
01:33:22,889 --> 01:33:25,517
How will you protect the nation?

878
01:33:43,285 --> 01:33:44,619
No!

879
01:33:59,050 --> 01:34:00,677
Soldier boy!

880
01:34:03,805 --> 01:34:08,560
This is exactly how
I killed your li'l miss sunshine.

881
01:34:13,315 --> 01:34:16,192
She thought she could defy me.

882
01:34:21,197 --> 01:34:23,825
Now you will meet the same fate as her.

883
01:34:24,451 --> 01:34:26,077
Tulika's hero--

884
01:38:50,258 --> 01:38:53,344
Do I need to die to be with you?

885
01:38:57,348 --> 01:38:59,976
I want to live my life with you,
Captain Rathod.
