- Careful what you wish for.

873
00:37:14,466 --> 00:37:15,999
- This where
the party's at?

874
00:37:16,001 --> 00:37:19,002

[gunshots]

876
00:37:27,279 --> 00:37:30,113
- Aah!

877
00:37:30,115 --> 00:37:31,581
- Mr. Snart,
can you hear me?

878
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:34,050
Do not let vostok leave
with that thermal core.

879
00:37:34,052 --> 00:37:37,354
[gunshots]

880
00:37:37,356 --> 00:37:39,222
- Get the hell out of here!

881
00:37:39,224 --> 00:37:40,257
What are you waiting for?

882
00:37:40,259 --> 00:37:41,658
Go, go!

883
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:44,661
[gunshots]

884
00:37:56,975 --> 00:37:59,576
- Now might be a good time
to send in reinforcements.

885
00:37:59,578 --> 00:38:01,711
Mick and stein just got pinched
by the russkies.

886
00:38:01,713 --> 00:38:03,613
- You're gonna have to
get out of there right now.

887
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:05,682
- They're hanging us out to dry,
rip; I need backup.

888
00:38:05,684 --> 00:38:07,851
- I'm afraid our only option
is retreat.

889
00:38:07,853 --> 00:38:09,252
- What about my partner?

890
00:38:09,254 --> 00:38:10,720
- Well, until we devise
our next move,

891
00:38:10,722 --> 00:38:12,622
Mr. Rory will have to
fend for himself.

892
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:13,923
<i>Remember the mission.</i>

893
00:38:13,925 --> 00:38:15,659
If the soviets get that
thermal core back,

894
00:38:15,661 --> 00:38:18,061
Your partner will not be
the only one who dies.

895
00:38:18,063 --> 00:38:20,163

896
00:38:20,165 --> 00:38:23,366
[explosion]

897
00:38:35,447 --> 00:38:37,213
- You better kill me now.

898
00:38:37,215 --> 00:38:38,982
If I ever get my hands on you,

899
00:38:38,984 --> 00:38:41,518
I'm gonna get all "rocky iv"
on your ass.

900
00:38:46,291 --> 00:38:47,957
I'm gonna remember that,
comrade.

901
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,563
- We must leave now, colonel.

902
00:38:53,565 --> 00:38:55,065
- There's still
one more intruder,

903
00:38:55,067 --> 00:38:56,333
And he has the thermal core.

904
00:38:56,335 --> 00:38:57,734
- We don't need it now.

905
00:38:57,736 --> 00:39:01,071
We have something far better.

906
00:39:09,781 --> 00:39:10,814
- Ugh,

907
00:39:10,816 --> 00:39:12,782
Thank god you managed
to grab it.

908
00:39:12,784 --> 00:39:15,418
- Where was my backup,
captain?

909
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,420
Half the team is gone...

910
00:39:17,422 --> 00:39:18,588
[laser powers up]

911
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:20,190
Because of you.

912
00:39:20,192 --> 00:39:22,492
- Only if I'd have sent
the other half in to save them,

913
00:39:22,494 --> 00:39:25,328
They'd be captured too,
and where would we be,

914
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:26,629
Hmm?

915
00:39:26,631 --> 00:39:28,431
Savage would have both halves
of firestorm,

916
00:39:28,433 --> 00:39:30,533
A dead kendra
on top of a dead carter,

917
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:33,036
Everything he wants.

918
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:35,105
It would be the end
to our little crusade,

919
00:39:35,107 --> 00:39:36,206
And, most likely, the world.

920
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:40,276
So before you
pull that trigger,

921
00:39:40,278 --> 00:39:43,046
Ask yourself:

922
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:44,848
What would you have done?

923
00:39:47,919 --> 00:39:51,988
- That is
a pretty cold calculation, rip.

924
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:53,990
Almost criminal,

925
00:39:53,992 --> 00:39:56,860
Except we criminals
have a code:

926
00:39:56,862 --> 00:39:58,695
"you never leave
one of your own behind."

927
00:39:58,697 --> 00:40:02,565
- We will get them back.

928
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:05,235
Now, if savage even hopes
to create a firestorm,

929
00:40:05,237 --> 00:40:09,372
First, he's going to need
a new one of these.

930
00:40:09,374 --> 00:40:10,373
- A thermal core?

931
00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:11,741
- Let me get this straight.

932
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:14,711
You had kendra and I
training for the next mission,

933
00:40:14,713 --> 00:40:16,613
When we should have been
out there helping them.

934
00:40:16,615 --> 00:40:19,315
- We will help them,
and our next mission

935
00:40:19,317 --> 00:40:21,151
Is to get our compatriots back
from vostok.

936
00:40:21,153 --> 00:40:23,086
- Who is to say
they're not already dead?

937
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:24,587
- Vostok needs
the professor alive

938
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:26,156
In order to rebuild
the thermal core.

939
00:40:26,158 --> 00:40:27,257
- And ray and rory?

940
00:40:27,259 --> 00:40:28,525
- Savage will
keep them alive too.

941
00:40:28,527 --> 00:40:30,059
- As leverage.

942
00:40:30,061 --> 00:40:32,629
He'll torture them
if stein tries to hold out.

943
00:40:32,631 --> 00:40:34,464
- Well, we'll have to pray
that he does.

944
00:40:34,466 --> 00:40:36,966
If savage's goal is
to create his own firestorm,

945
00:40:36,968 --> 00:40:40,203
Then stein himself is the key,
the missing piece of the puzzle.

946
00:40:40,205 --> 00:40:42,572
And if vostok figures out
how to turn stein's powers

947
00:40:42,574 --> 00:40:44,941
Against us, then...

948
00:40:48,413 --> 00:40:50,580
I'm afraid the world
is beyond saving.

949
00:40:50,582 --> 00:40:52,782
- Stein's a lot tougher
than he looks.

950
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:55,351
I mean, it will take a lot
to break him.

951
00:40:55,353 --> 00:40:57,654

953
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:01,624
