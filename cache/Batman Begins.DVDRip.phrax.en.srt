1
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:50,804
Rachel, let me see.

2
00:00:56,898 --> 00:01:00,018
-Can I see?
-Finders keepers. And I found it.

3
00:01:00,053 --> 00:01:01,735
In my garden.

4
00:01:03,446 --> 00:01:05,273
Finders keepers.

5
00:01:12,246 --> 00:01:13,740
Bruce?

6
00:01:18,753 --> 00:01:20,461
Bruce?

7
00:01:22,798 --> 00:01:25,254
Mom! Mr. Alfred!

8
00:01:48,198 --> 00:01:50,356
Did you have dream?

9
00:01:50,826 --> 00:01:52,699
Nightmare.

10
00:01:57,082 --> 00:01:58,540
Worse than this place?

11
00:02:20,563 --> 00:02:22,520
They are going to fight you.

12
00:02:22,899 --> 00:02:24,523
-Again?
-Until they kill you.

13
00:02:26,736 --> 00:02:28,527
Can they kill me before breakfast?

14
00:02:30,906 --> 00:02:33,741
You are in hell, little man.

15
00:02:37,037 --> 00:02:39,824
And I am the devil.

16
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:44,669
You're not the devil.

17
00:02:44,704 --> 00:02:46,212
You're practice.

18
00:03:29,672 --> 00:03:30,917
Solitary.

19
00:03:30,952 --> 00:03:33,041
-Why?
-For protection.

20
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:36,085
-I don't need protection.
-Protection for them.

21
00:03:39,765 --> 00:03:41,758
Get in.

22
00:03:45,646 --> 00:03:47,936
Are you so
desperate to fight criminals...

23
00:03:47,971 --> 00:03:50,639
...that you lock yourself in
to take them on one at a time?

24
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:55,775
Actually, there were seven of them.

25
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:58,236
I counted six, Mr. Wayne.

26
00:04:01,995 --> 00:04:03,205
How do you know my name?

27
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:06,450
The world is too small for someone
like Bruce Wayne to disappear...

28
00:04:06,485 --> 00:04:08,950
...no matter how deep
he chooses to sink.

29
00:04:08,985 --> 00:04:10,255
Who are you?

30
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:13,628
My name is merely Ducard,
but I speak for Ra's al Ghul...

31
00:04:13,663 --> 00:04:17,417
...a man greatly feared
by the criminal underworld.

32
00:04:17,452 --> 00:04:19,171
A man who can offer you a path.

33
00:04:20,096 --> 00:04:22,587
What makes you think I need a path?

34
00:04:22,974 --> 00:04:25,560
Someone like you
is only here by choice.

35
00:04:25,595 --> 00:04:28,141
You have been exploring
the criminal fraternity...

36
00:04:28,176 --> 00:04:30,768
...but whatever
your original intentions...

37
00:04:31,482 --> 00:04:34,816
...you have become truly lost.

38
00:04:36,362 --> 00:04:40,111
And what path can Ra's al Ghul offer?

39
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:44,322
The path of a man
who shares his hatred of evil...

40
00:04:44,357 --> 00:04:47,698
...and wishes to serve true justice.

41
00:04:48,165 --> 00:04:50,288
The path of the League of Shadows.

42
00:04:53,379 --> 00:04:55,632
-You're vigilantes.
-No, no, no.

43
00:04:55,667 --> 00:05:00,003
A vigilante is just a man lost in
the scramble for his own gratification.

44
00:05:00,038 --> 00:05:03,842
He can be destroyed or locked up.

45
00:05:05,182 --> 00:05:10,009
But if you make yourself more
than just a man...

46
00:05:10,044 --> 00:05:13,188
...if you devote yourself to an ideal...

47
00:05:13,223 --> 00:05:15,847
...and if they can't stop you...

48
00:05:16,234 --> 00:05:18,690
...then you become
something else entirely.

49
00:05:20,363 --> 00:05:21,905
Which is?

50
00:05:22,407 --> 00:05:25,361
Legend, Mr. Wayne.

51
00:05:26,703 --> 00:05:28,292
Tomorrow, you will be released.

52
00:05:28,327 --> 00:05:31,865
If you are bored of brawling with thieves
and want to achieve something...

53
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,541
...there is a rare blue flower
that grows on the eastern slopes.

54
00:05:35,576 --> 00:05:37,337
Pick one of these flowers.

55
00:05:37,372 --> 00:05:40,466
If you can carry it
to the top of the mountain...

56
00:05:40,501 --> 00:05:43,592
...you may find what you were
looking for in the first place.

57
00:05:43,627 --> 00:05:46,513
And what was I looking for?

58
00:05:48,224 --> 00:05:50,181
Only you can know that.

59
00:06:56,874 --> 00:07:00,954
You turn back. You go back.

60
00:08:08,527 --> 00:08:10,567
Ra's al Ghul?

61
00:08:20,789 --> 00:08:22,367
Wait.

62
00:08:24,989 --> 00:08:26,877
What are you seeking?

63
00:08:27,588 --> 00:08:29,580
I seek...

64
00:08:31,133 --> 00:08:33,375
...the means to fight injustice.

65
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,883
To turn fear...

66
00:08:36,221 --> 00:08:39,056
...against those
who prey on the fearful.

67
00:09:00,745 --> 00:09:03,829
To manipulate the fears in others...

68
00:09:04,665 --> 00:09:08,081
...you must first master your own.

69
00:09:08,628 --> 00:09:10,419
Are you ready to begin?

70
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:13,877
I can... I can barely stand.

71
00:09:13,912 --> 00:09:16,417
Death does not wait
for you to be ready!

72
00:09:16,452 --> 00:09:19,760
Death is not considerate or fair!

73
00:09:20,264 --> 00:09:24,890
And make no mistake,
here you face death.

74
00:09:28,772 --> 00:09:30,101
Tiger.

75
00:09:31,734 --> 00:09:33,525
Jujitsu.

76
00:09:35,737 --> 00:09:36,769
Panther.

77
00:09:40,284 --> 00:09:42,609
You're skilled. But this is not a dance.

78
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:49,625
And you are afraid.

79
00:09:52,587 --> 00:09:54,461
But not of me.

80
00:09:57,926 --> 00:10:00,417
Tell us, Mr. Wayne...

81
00:10:04,933 --> 00:10:08,099
...what do you fear?

82
00:10:17,236 --> 00:10:18,647
Bruce?

83
00:10:21,324 --> 00:10:23,815
It's okay. It's okay.

84
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:25,487
You'll be okay.

85
00:10:25,745 --> 00:10:28,117
Will we be needing
an ambulance, Master Wayne?

86
00:10:28,152 --> 00:10:31,201
No, I'll set the bone
and take him for an x-ray later.

87
00:10:31,236 --> 00:10:32,620
Very good, sir.

88
00:10:33,085 --> 00:10:36,786
-I'm very sorry, sir. I've told...
-Don't worry. It's fine.

89
00:10:39,049 --> 00:10:41,338
Took quite a fall,
didn't we, Master Bruce?

90
00:10:41,373 --> 00:10:42,638
And why do we fall?

91
00:10:42,673 --> 00:10:45,929
So we can learn to pick ourselves up.

92
00:10:49,685 --> 00:10:52,555
Just a little fall.
It's just a small fracture.

93
00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:03,356
The bats again?

94
00:11:06,534 --> 00:11:08,657
You know why they attacked you,
don't you?

95
00:11:09,162 --> 00:11:12,198
-They were afraid of you.
-Afraid of me?

96
00:11:12,233 --> 00:11:14,052
All creatures feel fear.

97
00:11:14,087 --> 00:11:15,836
Even the scary ones?

98
00:11:15,871 --> 00:11:17,917
Especially the scary ones.

99
00:11:18,296 --> 00:11:20,087
I got something to show you.

100
00:11:24,385 --> 00:11:27,719
-You think your mother will like them?
-Yeah.

101
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:30,547
-I think it's time to get up.
-Maybe.

102
00:11:30,582 --> 00:11:32,349
No going back to bed.

103
00:11:35,563 --> 00:11:37,651
Did you build this train, Dad?

104
00:11:37,686 --> 00:11:41,961
Gotham's been good to our family,
but the city's been suffering.

105
00:11:41,996 --> 00:11:46,201
People less fortunate than us
have been enduring very hard times.

106
00:11:46,236 --> 00:11:50,356
So we built a new, cheap, public
transportation system to unite the city.

107
00:11:50,391 --> 00:11:52,244
And at the center...

108
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:54,204
...Wayne Tower.

109
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:57,450
-Is that where you work?
-No, I work at the hospital.

110
00:11:57,485 --> 00:12:00,662
I leave the running of our company
to much better men.

111
00:12:00,697 --> 00:12:02,910
-Better?
-Well...

112
00:12:02,945 --> 00:12:05,123
...more interested men.

113
00:13:01,521 --> 00:13:02,932
Can we go?

114
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:06,811
Please.

115
00:13:07,402 --> 00:13:09,442
Okay. Let's go.

116
00:13:18,663 --> 00:13:21,534
-What's wrong, Bruce?
-No, no. It was me.

117
00:13:21,569 --> 00:13:23,796
I just needed some fresh air.

118
00:13:23,831 --> 00:13:27,168
A little bit of opera goes a long way.
Right, Bruce?

119
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:32,504
Come on. Let's go.

120
00:13:37,974 --> 00:13:39,662
Wallets, jewelry. Come on, fast.

121
00:13:39,697 --> 00:13:41,351
That's fine.
Fast.

122
00:13:41,386 --> 00:13:43,013
Take it easy.

123
00:13:43,688 --> 00:13:45,230
Take it easy.

124
00:13:46,023 --> 00:13:47,482
Here you go.

125
00:13:50,236 --> 00:13:53,071
It's fine. It's fine.

126
00:13:53,948 --> 00:13:57,032
Now just take it and go.

127
00:13:57,067 --> 00:13:58,571
-I said, jewelry.
-Hey...

128
00:14:01,026 --> 00:14:02,403
Thomas!

129
00:14:10,422 --> 00:14:12,047
Bruce.

130
00:14:14,676 --> 00:14:16,051
It's okay.

131
00:14:19,222 --> 00:14:20,930
Don't be afraid.

132
00:14:52,755 --> 00:14:54,546
Is this your father's?

133
00:14:56,092 --> 00:14:58,214
It's okay.

134
00:14:59,428 --> 00:15:01,053
Come here.

135
00:15:03,766 --> 00:15:05,972
There you go.

136
00:15:09,104 --> 00:15:11,097
It's okay.

137
00:15:12,858 --> 00:15:14,767
It's okay.

138
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,275
Gordon.

139
00:15:28,373 --> 00:15:29,951
Hey.

140
00:15:30,584 --> 00:15:31,782
Good news.

141
00:15:33,253 --> 00:15:35,127
We got him, son.

142
00:15:55,817 --> 00:15:57,651
You're in excellent hands.

143
00:15:57,686 --> 00:15:59,450
We'll be watching the empire.

144
00:15:59,485 --> 00:16:02,654
When you grow up,
it'll be waiting for you.

145
00:16:18,672 --> 00:16:21,792
I thought I might prepare a little supper.

146
00:16:26,972 --> 00:16:29,048
-Very well.
-Alfred?

147
00:16:33,019 --> 00:16:35,012
-Yes, Master Bruce?
-It was my fault, Alfred.

148
00:16:35,047 --> 00:16:36,813
-I made them leave the theater.
-No.

149
00:16:36,848 --> 00:16:40,060
-If I hadn't gotten scared...
-It was nothing that you did.

150
00:16:41,194 --> 00:16:44,528
It was him, and him alone.

151
00:16:45,031 --> 00:16:46,525
Do you understand?

152
00:16:49,661 --> 00:16:52,697
I miss them, Alfred.
I miss them so much.

153
00:16:52,732 --> 00:16:54,865
So do I, Master Bruce.

154
00:16:57,293 --> 00:16:58,538
So do I.

155
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:03,672
And do you still feel
responsible for your parents' death?

156
00:17:03,707 --> 00:17:05,917
My anger outweighs my guilt.

157
00:17:06,677 --> 00:17:08,053
Come.

158
00:17:12,725 --> 00:17:15,395
You have learned to bury
your guilt with anger.

159
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:18,639
I will teach you to confront it
and to face the truth.

160
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:26,108
You know how to fight six men.
We can teach you how to engage 600.

161
00:17:27,364 --> 00:17:29,203
You know how to disappear.

162
00:17:29,238 --> 00:17:31,614
We can teach you
to become truly invisible.

163
00:17:33,245 --> 00:17:34,953
Invisible?

164
00:17:38,959 --> 00:17:43,585
The ninja understands that invisibility
is a matter of patience and agility.

165
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,267
Always mind your surroundings.

166
00:18:01,439 --> 00:18:03,645
Ninjitsu employs explosive powders.

167
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:07,358
-As weapons?
-Or distractions.

168
00:18:07,393 --> 00:18:09,895
Theatricality and deception
are powerful agents.

169
00:18:10,364 --> 00:18:13,401
You must become more than just a man
in the mind of your opponent.

170
00:18:15,696 --> 00:18:17,792
-Who is he?
-He was a farmer.

171
00:18:17,827 --> 00:18:21,247
Then he tried to take his neighbor's land
and became a murderer.

172
00:18:21,282 --> 00:18:23,706
-Now he is a prisoner.
-What'll happen to him?

173
00:18:23,741 --> 00:18:26,250
Justice. Crime cannot be tolerated.

174
00:18:26,285 --> 00:18:30,413
Criminals thrive on the indulgence
of society's understanding.

175
00:18:34,471 --> 00:18:37,306
Your parents' death was not your fault.

176
00:18:45,649 --> 00:18:46,894
It was your father's.

177
00:19:07,795 --> 00:19:10,630
Anger does not change the fact
that your father failed to act.

178
00:19:10,665 --> 00:19:13,005
-The man had a gun.
-Would that stop you?

179
00:19:13,801 --> 00:19:14,964
I've had training.

180
00:19:14,999 --> 00:19:17,004
The training is nothing!

181
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,840
Will is everything!

182
00:19:24,645 --> 00:19:26,472
The will to act.

183
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,485
Yield.

184
00:19:37,783 --> 00:19:39,159
You haven't beaten me.

185
00:19:39,194 --> 00:19:42,073
You have sacrificed sure footing
for a killing stroke.

186
00:19:49,711 --> 00:19:51,503
Rub your chest.

187
00:19:52,005 --> 00:19:54,876
Your arms will take care of themselves.

188
00:19:57,552 --> 00:19:59,177
You are stronger than your father.

189
00:19:59,846 --> 00:20:01,436
You didn't know my father.

190
00:20:01,471 --> 00:20:03,893
But I know the rage that drives you.

191
00:20:03,928 --> 00:20:06,579
That impossible anger
strangling the grief...

192
00:20:06,614 --> 00:20:09,230
...until the memory
of your loved one is just...

193
00:20:09,265 --> 00:20:11,355
...poison in your veins.

194
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:16,027
And one day, you catch yourself wishing
the person you loved had never existed...

195
00:20:17,447 --> 00:20:19,902
...so you'd be spared your pain.

196
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:26,279
I wasn't always here in the mountains.

197
00:20:27,915 --> 00:20:29,955
Once, I had a wife.

198
00:20:30,918 --> 00:20:32,827
My great love.

199
00:20:34,005 --> 00:20:36,092
She was taken from me.

200
00:20:36,127 --> 00:20:39,502
Like you, I was forced to learn
there are those without decency...

201
00:20:39,537 --> 00:20:42,962
...who must be fought
without hesitation, without pity.

202
00:20:44,765 --> 00:20:47,090
Your anger gives you great power.

203
00:20:47,601 --> 00:20:51,136
But if you let it, it will destroy you...

204
00:20:51,688 --> 00:20:52,933
...as it almost did me.

205
00:20:53,607 --> 00:20:56,561
-What stopped it?
-Vengeance.

206
00:20:56,777 --> 00:20:58,604
That's no help to me.

207
00:20:58,639 --> 00:21:00,570
Why, Bruce?

208
00:21:00,605 --> 00:21:03,450
Why could you not
avenge your parents?

209
00:21:07,287 --> 00:21:10,738
Will you be heading back to Princeton
after the hearing, sir...

210
00:21:10,773 --> 00:21:13,585
...or can I persuade you to stay on
for a day or two?

211
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,923
I'm not heading back at all.

212
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:18,205
-You don't like it there?
-I like it fine.

213
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:21,377
They just don't feel the same way.

214
00:21:22,177 --> 00:21:25,842
-I've prepared the master bedroom.
-No.

215
00:21:25,877 --> 00:21:27,389
My room will be fine.

216
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:30,350
With all due respect, sir,
Wayne Manor is your house.

217
00:21:30,385 --> 00:21:32,310
No, Alfred, it's my father's house.

218
00:21:32,345 --> 00:21:34,643
-Your father is dead.
-This place is a mausoleum.

219
00:21:34,678 --> 00:21:37,857
If I have my way, I'll pull
the damn thing down brick by brick.

220
00:21:37,892 --> 00:21:42,147
This house, Master Wayne, has sheltered
six generations of your family.

221
00:21:42,182 --> 00:21:45,026
Why do you give a damn, Alfred?
It's not your family.

222
00:21:45,866 --> 00:21:49,734
I give a damn because a good man
once made me responsible...

223
00:21:50,412 --> 00:21:52,571
...for what was most precious to him...

224
00:21:52,606 --> 00:21:54,990
...in the whole world.

225
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,495
Miss Dawes has offered
to drive you to the hearing.

226
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:02,677
She probably hopes
to talk you out of going.

227
00:22:02,712 --> 00:22:06,154
Should I just bury the past
out there with my parents, Alfred?

228
00:22:06,189 --> 00:22:09,561
I wouldn't presume to tell you
what to do with your past, sir.

229
00:22:09,596 --> 00:22:13,809
Just know that there are those of us who
care about what you do with your future.

230
00:22:15,187 --> 00:22:16,681
Haven't given up on me yet?

231
00:22:17,355 --> 00:22:18,850
Never.

232
00:23:07,404 --> 00:23:11,402
Alfred still keeps the condensed milk
on the top shelf.

233
00:23:11,617 --> 00:23:13,574
Hasn't he noticed
you're tall enough to reach now?

234
00:23:13,911 --> 00:23:15,418
Old habits die hard, I guess.

235
00:23:15,453 --> 00:23:18,028
-Never used to stop us anyway.
-No, it didn't.

236
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:20,080
How's your mom?

237
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,742
She misses this place.

238
00:23:24,254 --> 00:23:25,748
So do I.

239
00:23:26,172 --> 00:23:27,382
Yeah.

240
00:23:27,417 --> 00:23:30,591
But it's nothing without the people
who made it what it was.

241
00:23:30,626 --> 00:23:33,726
-Now there's only Alfred.
-And you.

242
00:23:33,761 --> 00:23:37,465
-I'm not staying, Rachel.
-You're just back for the hearing.

243
00:23:41,104 --> 00:23:45,267
Bruce, I don't suppose there's any way
to convince you not to come.

244
00:23:45,608 --> 00:23:49,107
Someone at this proceeding...

245
00:23:49,779 --> 00:23:52,008
...should stand for my parents.

246
00:23:52,043 --> 00:23:54,202
We all loved your parents, Bruce.

247
00:23:54,237 --> 00:23:57,611
-What Chill did is unforgivable.
-Then why is your boss letting him go?

248
00:23:58,996 --> 00:24:02,211
In prison, he shared a cell
with Carmine Falcone.

249
00:24:02,246 --> 00:24:06,081
He learned things, and he will testify
in exchange for early parole.

250
00:24:06,116 --> 00:24:08,922
Rachel, this man killed my parents.

251
00:24:10,924 --> 00:24:12,597
I cannot let that pass.

252
00:24:12,632 --> 00:24:15,672
And I need you
to understand that, please.

253
00:24:17,431 --> 00:24:18,629
Okay.

254
00:24:19,725 --> 00:24:23,078
The depression hit working
people, like Mr. Chill, hardest of all.

255
00:24:23,113 --> 00:24:26,431
His crime was appalling, yes,
but it was motivated not by greed...

256
00:24:26,773 --> 00:24:28,398
...but by desperation.

257
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:32,523
Given the 14 years served, as well as
his extraordinary level of cooperation...

258
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:35,317
...with one of this office's
most important investigations...

259
00:24:35,352 --> 00:24:38,610
...we strongly endorse his petition
for early release.

260
00:24:39,619 --> 00:24:41,908
Mr. Chill?

261
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,160
Your Honor...

262
00:24:48,044 --> 00:24:51,164
...not a day goes by that I don't wish
I could take back what I did.

263
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:57,050
Sure, I was desperate,
like a lot of people back then...

264
00:24:57,085 --> 00:24:59,545
...but that don't change what I did.

265
00:25:03,184 --> 00:25:07,846
I gather there is a member
of the Wayne family here today.

266
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:10,311
Has he got anything to say?

267
00:25:24,413 --> 00:25:27,864
He's coming out the side!
He's coming out the side, guys!

268
00:25:37,551 --> 00:25:38,831
Bruce Wayne!

269
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,883
Joe! Hey, Joe!

270
00:25:42,918 --> 00:25:44,087
Falcone says hi.

271
00:25:54,901 --> 00:25:56,478
Come on, Bruce.

272
00:25:56,861 --> 00:25:58,486
We don't need to see this.

273
00:25:59,238 --> 00:26:00,781
I do.

274
00:26:05,912 --> 00:26:08,319
The DA couldn't understand
why Judge Faden insisted...

275
00:26:08,354 --> 00:26:09,921
...on making the hearing public.

276
00:26:09,956 --> 00:26:12,496
Falcone paid him off
to get Chill out in the open.

277
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:13,920
Maybe I should thank them.

278
00:26:13,955 --> 00:26:16,701
-You don't mean that.
-What if I do, Rachel?

279
00:26:16,736 --> 00:26:18,755
My parents deserved justice.

280
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:21,856
You're not talking about justice.
You're talking about revenge.

281
00:26:21,891 --> 00:26:24,888
-Sometimes, they're the same.
-No, they're never the same.

282
00:26:24,923 --> 00:26:28,680
Justice is about harmony. Revenge is
about you making yourself feel better.

283
00:26:28,715 --> 00:26:32,136
-It's why we have an impartial system.
-Your system is broken.

284
00:26:39,236 --> 00:26:42,071
You care about justice?
Look beyond your own pain, Bruce.

285
00:26:42,489 --> 00:26:43,913
This city is rotting.

286
00:26:43,948 --> 00:26:46,903
They talk about the depression
as if it's history. It's not.

287
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:48,536
Things are worse than ever here.

288
00:26:48,571 --> 00:26:51,248
Falcone floods our streets
with crime and drugs...

289
00:26:51,283 --> 00:26:54,410
...preying on the desperate,
creating new Joe Chills every day.

290
00:26:54,445 --> 00:26:57,122
Falcone may not have killed
your parents, Bruce...

291
00:26:57,754 --> 00:27:00,245
...but he's destroying everything
that they stood for.

292
00:27:04,802 --> 00:27:07,673
You wanna thank him for that?
Here you go.

293
00:27:09,557 --> 00:27:12,593
We all know where to find him.
As long as he keeps the bad people rich...

294
00:27:12,628 --> 00:27:14,856
...and the good people scared,
no one'll touch him.

295
00:27:14,891 --> 00:27:19,309
Good people like your parents, who'll
stand against injustice, they're gone.

296
00:27:19,344 --> 00:27:23,184
What chance does Gotham have
when the good people do nothing?

297
00:27:24,071 --> 00:27:27,487
-I'm not one of your good people, Rachel.
-What do you mean?

298
00:27:29,743 --> 00:27:32,780
All these years, I wanted to kill him.

299
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,158
Now I can't.

300
00:27:51,056 --> 00:27:52,764
Your father would be ashamed of you.

301
00:28:36,225 --> 00:28:38,716
You're taller than you look
in the tabloids, Mr. Wayne.

302
00:28:39,186 --> 00:28:41,060
No gun? I'm insulted.

303
00:28:44,233 --> 00:28:48,017
-You could've just sent a thank-you note.
-I didn't come here to thank you.

304
00:28:48,052 --> 00:28:50,947
I came to show you that
not everyone in Gotham's afraid of you.

305
00:28:50,982 --> 00:28:52,739
Only those who know me, kid.

306
00:28:53,075 --> 00:28:55,566
Look around you.
You'll see two councilmen...

307
00:28:55,911 --> 00:28:58,746
...a union official,
couple off-duty cops...

308
00:28:59,164 --> 00:29:00,753
...and a judge.

309
00:29:00,788 --> 00:29:05,251
I wouldn't have a second's hesitation of
blowing your head off in front of them.

310
00:29:05,286 --> 00:29:08,125
Now, that's power you can't buy.

311
00:29:08,757 --> 00:29:10,215
That's the power of fear.

312
00:29:10,633 --> 00:29:11,843
I'm not afraid of you.

313
00:29:11,878 --> 00:29:13,961
Because you think you got
nothing to lose.

314
00:29:13,996 --> 00:29:15,762
But you haven't thought it through.

315
00:29:15,797 --> 00:29:19,056
You haven't thought about
your lady friend in the DA's office.

316
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:22,261
You haven't thought about
your old butler. Bang!

317
00:29:25,773 --> 00:29:28,210
People from your world...

318
00:29:28,245 --> 00:29:30,613
...have so much to lose.

319
00:29:30,648 --> 00:29:35,149
Now, you think because your mommy
and your daddy got shot...

320
00:29:35,184 --> 00:29:38,278
...you know about the ugly side of life,
but you don't.

321
00:29:38,313 --> 00:29:40,540
You've never tasted desperate.

322
00:29:40,575 --> 00:29:43,249
You're... You're Bruce Wayne,
the prince of Gotham.

323
00:29:43,284 --> 00:29:47,311
You'd have to go 1000 miles to meet
someone who didn't know your name.

324
00:29:47,346 --> 00:29:51,338
So don't come here with your anger,
trying to prove something to yourself.

325
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:53,630
This is a world you'll never understand.

326
00:29:53,665 --> 00:29:55,758
And you always fear...

327
00:29:55,793 --> 00:29:58,425
...what you don't understand.

328
00:30:01,308 --> 00:30:02,683
All right.

329
00:30:10,317 --> 00:30:13,152
Yeah, you got spirit, kid.
I'll give you that.

330
00:30:13,187 --> 00:30:15,277
More than your old man anyway.

331
00:30:15,312 --> 00:30:19,782
In the joint, Chill told me about
the night he killed your parents.

332
00:30:19,817 --> 00:30:22,157
He said your father begged for mercy.

333
00:30:23,538 --> 00:30:25,185
Begged.

334
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,832
Like a dog.

335
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:41,470
Should've tipped better.

336
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:53,309
-For what?
-Your jacket.

337
00:30:53,859 --> 00:30:55,484
Okay.

338
00:30:56,570 --> 00:31:00,021
Hey, hey, hey. Let me have it.
It's a nice coat.

339
00:31:00,056 --> 00:31:02,322
Be careful who sees you with that.

340
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:04,819
-They're gonna come looking for me.
-Who?

341
00:31:05,287 --> 00:31:06,995
Everyone.

342
00:31:09,291 --> 00:31:10,999
It's...

343
00:31:11,034 --> 00:31:13,202
It's a nice coat.

344
00:31:31,521 --> 00:31:35,626
When you lived among
the criminals, did you start to pity them?

345
00:31:35,661 --> 00:31:39,732
The first time I stole
so that I wouldn't starve, yes.

346
00:31:39,946 --> 00:31:45,402
I lost many assumptions about
the simple nature of right and wrong.

347
00:31:46,702 --> 00:31:48,743
And when I traveled...

348
00:31:48,778 --> 00:31:51,659
...I learned the fear before a crime...

349
00:31:52,416 --> 00:31:54,990
...and the thrill of success.

350
00:31:56,705 --> 00:31:58,753
But I never became one of them.

351
00:32:01,592 --> 00:32:04,712
Fool. What do I care
what your name is? You're a criminal.

352
00:32:04,747 --> 00:32:06,512
I'm not a criminal

353
00:32:06,547 --> 00:32:08,880
Tell that to the guy who owned these.

354
00:32:10,976 --> 00:32:14,096
You've traveled the world
to understand the criminal mind...

355
00:32:14,131 --> 00:32:15,551
...and conquer your fears.

356
00:32:17,649 --> 00:32:21,742
But a criminal is not complicated.

357
00:32:21,777 --> 00:32:25,279
And what you really fear
is inside yourself.

358
00:32:25,314 --> 00:32:27,377
You fear your own power.

359
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:29,440
You fear your anger...

360
00:32:29,911 --> 00:32:34,158
...the drive to do great
or terrible things.

361
00:32:34,193 --> 00:32:37,783
Now you must journey inwards.

362
00:32:41,548 --> 00:32:43,624
You are ready.

363
00:32:44,634 --> 00:32:46,045
Breathe.

364
00:32:55,603 --> 00:32:57,477
Breathe.

365
00:33:02,485 --> 00:33:04,311
Breathe in your fears.

366
00:33:06,947 --> 00:33:07,979
Face them.

367
00:33:09,491 --> 00:33:12,656
To conquer fear,
you must become fear.

368
00:33:12,691 --> 00:33:15,822
You must bask in the fear
of other men.

369
00:33:17,291 --> 00:33:20,707
And men fear most
what they cannot see.

370
00:33:37,936 --> 00:33:40,806
You have to become a terrible thought.

371
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,558
A wraith.

372
00:33:52,283 --> 00:33:54,655
You have to become an idea!

373
00:34:01,542 --> 00:34:04,579
Feel terror cloud your senses.

374
00:34:06,339 --> 00:34:09,542
Feel its power to distort.

375
00:34:10,509 --> 00:34:12,716
To control.

376
00:34:15,806 --> 00:34:19,590
And know that this power
can be yours.

377
00:34:32,155 --> 00:34:34,825
Embrace your worst fear.

378
00:34:41,832 --> 00:34:44,120
Become one with the darkness.

379
00:35:03,936 --> 00:35:05,644
Focus.

380
00:35:05,938 --> 00:35:08,062
Concentrate.

381
00:35:08,097 --> 00:35:10,397
Master your senses.

382
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,926
You cannot leave any sign.

383
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:42,504
I haven't.

384
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:52,808
Impressive.

385
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,986
We have purged your fear.

386
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,752
You are ready to lead these men.

387
00:36:06,787 --> 00:36:10,491
You are ready to become a member
of the League of Shadows.

388
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:17,292
But first, you must demonstrate
your commitment to justice.

389
00:36:34,024 --> 00:36:35,400
No.

390
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,141
I'm no executioner.

391
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:42,361
Your compassion is
a weakness your enemies will not share.

392
00:36:42,741 --> 00:36:45,030
That's why it's so important.

393
00:36:45,285 --> 00:36:46,994
It separates us from them.

394
00:36:47,029 --> 00:36:49,529
You want to fight criminals.
This man is a murderer.

395
00:36:49,564 --> 00:36:51,615
-This man should be tried.
-By whom?

396
00:36:51,833 --> 00:36:53,376
Corrupt bureaucrats?

397
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:55,977
Criminals mock society's laws.

398
00:36:56,012 --> 00:36:58,543
You know this better than most.

399
00:36:59,424 --> 00:37:02,010
You cannot lead these men...

400
00:37:02,045 --> 00:37:06,216
...unless you are prepared to do
what is necessary to defeat evil.

401
00:37:06,806 --> 00:37:09,214
And where would I be leading
these men?

402
00:37:09,767 --> 00:37:11,013
Gotham.

403
00:37:11,048 --> 00:37:13,232
As Gotham's favored son...

404
00:37:13,267 --> 00:37:17,767
...you will be ideally placed
to strike at the heart of criminality.

405
00:37:18,151 --> 00:37:21,864
-How?
-Gotham's time has come.

406
00:37:21,899 --> 00:37:25,370
Like Constantinople or Rome before it...

407
00:37:25,405 --> 00:37:29,786
...the city has become a breeding ground
for suffering and injustice.

408
00:37:29,821 --> 00:37:33,537
It is beyond saving
and must be allowed to die.

409
00:37:33,572 --> 00:37:38,909
This is the most important function
of the League of Shadows.

410
00:37:39,213 --> 00:37:42,297
It is one we've performed for centuries.

411
00:37:42,633 --> 00:37:44,341
Gotham...

412
00:37:44,376 --> 00:37:47,422
...must be destroyed.

413
00:37:50,766 --> 00:37:52,260
You can't believe in this.

414
00:37:52,476 --> 00:37:57,019
Ra's al Ghul rescued us from
the darkest corners of our own hearts.

415
00:37:57,054 --> 00:38:01,601
What he asks in return is the courage
to do what is necessary.

416
00:38:01,818 --> 00:38:05,152
I will go back to Gotham
and I will fight men like this...

417
00:38:05,187 --> 00:38:07,895
...but I will not become an executioner.

418
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:09,581
Bruce, please.

419
00:38:09,616 --> 00:38:12,619
For your own sake,
there is no turning back.

420
00:38:44,985 --> 00:38:47,523
-What are you doing?
-What's necessary, my friend.

421
00:41:03,954 --> 00:41:07,074
I will tell him you saved his life.

422
00:41:25,809 --> 00:41:28,309
Master Wayne,
you've been gone a long time.

423
00:41:28,344 --> 00:41:30,809
-Yes, I have.
-You look very fashionable.

424
00:41:32,315 --> 00:41:33,809
Apart from the mud.

425
00:41:34,067 --> 00:41:36,736
Are you coming back to Gotham
for long, sir?

426
00:41:36,771 --> 00:41:38,113
As long as it takes.

427
00:41:38,148 --> 00:41:39,780
I want to show the people...

428
00:41:39,815 --> 00:41:43,370
...their city doesn't belong
to the criminals and the corrupt.

429
00:41:43,405 --> 00:41:46,779
In the depression, your father nearly
bankrupted Wayne Enterprises...

430
00:41:46,814 --> 00:41:48,153
...combating poverty.

431
00:41:48,373 --> 00:41:52,869
He believed his example could inspire
the wealthy of Gotham to save their city.

432
00:41:53,169 --> 00:41:54,793
Did it?

433
00:41:55,922 --> 00:41:57,345
In a way.

434
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:00,632
Their murder shocked the wealthy
and the powerful into action.

435
00:42:02,637 --> 00:42:05,673
People need dramatic examples
to shake them out of apathy.

436
00:42:05,708 --> 00:42:07,508
I can't do that as Bruce Wayne.

437
00:42:07,543 --> 00:42:09,190
As a man...

438
00:42:09,225 --> 00:42:11,801
...I'm flesh and blood,
I can be ignored, destroyed.

439
00:42:11,836 --> 00:42:13,888
But as a symbol...

440
00:42:15,357 --> 00:42:18,086
As a symbol, I can be incorruptible.

441
00:42:18,121 --> 00:42:20,815
-I can be everlasting.
-What symbol?

442
00:42:21,405 --> 00:42:23,635
Something elemental...

443
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:25,830
...something terrifying.

444
00:42:25,865 --> 00:42:28,122
I assume that as you take on
the underworld...

445
00:42:28,157 --> 00:42:33,453
...this symbol is a persona to protect
those you care about from reprisals?

446
00:42:33,488 --> 00:42:34,965
You're thinking about Rachel?

447
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,540
Actually, sir, I was thinking of myself.

448
00:42:39,548 --> 00:42:41,291
Have you told anyone I'm coming back?

449
00:42:41,508 --> 00:42:45,719
I couldn't figure the legal ramifications
of bringing you back from the dead.

450
00:42:45,754 --> 00:42:47,761
-Dead?
-You've been gone seven years.

451
00:42:47,796 --> 00:42:49,176
You had me declared dead?

452
00:42:49,211 --> 00:42:52,261
Actually, it was Mr. Earle.
He's taking the company public.

453
00:42:52,296 --> 00:42:54,724
He wanted to liquidate
your majority shareholding.

454
00:42:54,759 --> 00:42:57,186
Those shares are worth
quite a bit of money.

455
00:42:57,221 --> 00:43:00,103
Well, it's a good thing
I left everything to you, then.

456
00:43:00,651 --> 00:43:02,241
Quite so, sir.

457
00:43:02,276 --> 00:43:06,193
And you can borrow the Rolls, if you like.
Just bring it back with a full tank.

458
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:20,959
In my opinion, Mr. Zsaz is as much
a danger to himself as to others...

459
00:43:21,338 --> 00:43:25,917
...and prison is probably not the best
environment for his rehabilitation.

460
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:30,758
-Dr. Crane.
-Miss Dawes.

461
00:43:30,793 --> 00:43:34,258
You think a man who butchers people
for the mob doesn't belong in jail?

462
00:43:34,293 --> 00:43:37,069
I would hardly have testified to that
otherwise, would I?

463
00:43:37,104 --> 00:43:40,355
This is the third of Falcone's thugs
you've had declared insane...

464
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:41,934
...and moved into your asylum.

465
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:46,777
The work offered by organized crime
must have an attraction to the insane.

466
00:43:48,323 --> 00:43:50,315
Or the corrupt.

467
00:43:52,577 --> 00:43:54,155
Mr. Finch.

468
00:43:54,496 --> 00:43:56,252
You should check
with Miss Dawes here...

469
00:43:56,287 --> 00:44:00,833
...just what implications your office
has authorized her to make. If any.

470
00:44:04,797 --> 00:44:07,123
-What are you doing?
-What are you doing, Carl?

471
00:44:07,158 --> 00:44:08,675
Looking out for you.

472
00:44:11,179 --> 00:44:14,096
Falcone has half the city
bought and paid for.

473
00:44:14,131 --> 00:44:16,269
-Drop it.
-How can you say that?

474
00:44:16,304 --> 00:44:20,176
Because as much as I care about
getting Falcone, I care more about you.

475
00:44:20,211 --> 00:44:21,635
That's sweet.

476
00:44:27,069 --> 00:44:29,441
We've been through all that.

477
00:44:55,513 --> 00:44:56,972
Blessed bat again, sir.

478
00:44:57,432 --> 00:44:59,840
They nest somewhere in the grounds.

479
00:46:57,716 --> 00:47:00,386
No more favors.
Someone is sniffing around.

480
00:47:00,421 --> 00:47:03,548
Hey, I scratch your back,
you scratch mine, doc.

481
00:47:03,583 --> 00:47:05,097
I'm bringing in the shipments.

482
00:47:05,807 --> 00:47:06,970
We are paying you for that.

483
00:47:07,005 --> 00:47:09,675
Maybe money isn't as interesting
to me as favors.

484
00:47:12,188 --> 00:47:16,981
I am more than aware that you are
not intimidated by me, Mr. Falcone.

485
00:47:17,016 --> 00:47:20,236
But you know who I'm working for,
and when he gets here...

486
00:47:20,271 --> 00:47:22,314
He... He's coming to Gotham?

487
00:47:22,349 --> 00:47:23,914
Yes, he is.

488
00:47:23,949 --> 00:47:26,537
And when he gets here,
he's not going to wanna hear...

489
00:47:26,572 --> 00:47:31,821
...that you've endangered our operation
just to get your thugs out of jail time.

490
00:47:32,834 --> 00:47:36,167
-Who's bothering you?
-There's a girl at the DA's office.

491
00:47:36,671 --> 00:47:38,462
-We'll buy her off.
-Not this one.

492
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:41,464
Idealist, huh?

493
00:47:41,499 --> 00:47:43,383
Well, there's an answer to that too.

494
00:47:43,761 --> 00:47:46,715
-I don't want to know.
-Yes, you do.

495
00:47:50,893 --> 00:47:54,309
No, we are showing
very healthy growth in these sectors.

496
00:47:54,344 --> 00:47:57,688
I don't think Thomas Wayne would have
viewed heavy-arms manufacture...

497
00:47:57,723 --> 00:48:00,016
...as a suitable cornerstone
for our business.

498
00:48:01,403 --> 00:48:05,187
Well, that's 20 years ago, Fredericks.

499
00:48:05,532 --> 00:48:08,664
I think after 20 years
we can allow ourselves...

500
00:48:08,699 --> 00:48:11,704
...to stop thinking about what
Thomas Wayne would have done.

501
00:48:11,739 --> 00:48:13,710
Good morning, Mr. Earle's office.

502
00:48:13,745 --> 00:48:17,201
Yes, he's confirmed for
the dinner tomorrow evening.

503
00:48:17,236 --> 00:48:20,710
Good morning.
I'm here to see Mr. Earle.

504
00:48:20,745 --> 00:48:22,375
Name?

505
00:48:22,841 --> 00:48:24,501
Bruce Wayne.

506
00:48:26,386 --> 00:48:29,850
Thomas would probably not
have taken the company public.

507
00:48:29,885 --> 00:48:34,136
But that is what we,
as responsible managers, are going to do.

508
00:48:34,852 --> 00:48:36,395
Jessica?

509
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,983
Jessica? Where are you?

510
00:48:40,018 --> 00:48:44,438
-Eye on the ball, and...
-Why is no one answering the phone?

511
00:48:45,112 --> 00:48:48,279
It's Wayne Enterprises, Mr. Earle.
I'm sure they'll call back.

512
00:48:48,616 --> 00:48:51,107
Bruce? You're supposed to be dead.

513
00:48:51,142 --> 00:48:53,207
I'm sorry to disappoint.

514
00:48:53,242 --> 00:48:56,117
-I need you to take a look at this.
-Have you seen him yet?

515
00:48:56,415 --> 00:48:57,957
-Who?
-Wayne.

516
00:48:58,292 --> 00:49:00,368
It's been all over the news.
He's back.

517
00:49:04,298 --> 00:49:07,215
I'm sure you realize
I can't stop the big machine.

518
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:08,582
Too many wheels turning.

519
00:49:08,802 --> 00:49:10,795
-We're going public.
-I understand.

520
00:49:11,263 --> 00:49:14,098
And I'll be handsomely rewarded
for my shares.

521
00:49:14,133 --> 00:49:16,804
I'm not looking to interfere.

522
00:49:17,269 --> 00:49:19,357
-I am looking for a job.
-Oh?

523
00:49:19,392 --> 00:49:22,599
I just want to get to know the company
that my family built.

524
00:49:22,941 --> 00:49:24,684
Any ideas where you would start?

525
00:49:25,193 --> 00:49:27,565
Applied Sciences caught my eye.

526
00:49:27,946 --> 00:49:29,619
Fox's department.

527
00:49:29,654 --> 00:49:31,815
I'll let him know you're coming.

528
00:49:32,742 --> 00:49:35,494
You look like him. Your dad.

529
00:49:36,287 --> 00:49:38,957
You're the only one left
of the Wayne family.

530
00:49:38,992 --> 00:49:43,073
This is where you belong.
Welcome home.

531
00:49:43,419 --> 00:49:47,915
Environmental procedures,
defense projects, consumer products.

532
00:49:48,424 --> 00:49:51,197
All prototypes. None in production.

533
00:49:51,232 --> 00:49:53,971
-On any level whatsoever.
-None?

534
00:49:54,972 --> 00:49:56,993
What did they tell you this place was?

535
00:49:57,028 --> 00:49:59,014
They didn't tell me anything.

536
00:50:01,479 --> 00:50:04,930
Earle told me exactly what it was
when he sent me down here.

537
00:50:05,399 --> 00:50:06,823
Dead end.

538
00:50:06,858 --> 00:50:10,359
Place to keep me from causing
the board any more trouble.

539
00:50:11,322 --> 00:50:12,781
Come on.

540
00:50:12,816 --> 00:50:15,445
-You were on the board?
-When your father ran things.

541
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,491
-You knew my father?
-Oh, yeah.

542
00:50:17,526 --> 00:50:19,321
Helped him build his train.

543
00:50:19,913 --> 00:50:21,538
Here we are.

544
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:26,835
Kevlar utility harness.

545
00:50:27,212 --> 00:50:29,438
Gas-powered, magnetic grapple gun.

546
00:50:29,473 --> 00:50:31,664
The 350-pound test monofilament.

547
00:50:35,011 --> 00:50:37,170
Wonderful project, your dad's train.

548
00:50:37,681 --> 00:50:42,307
Routed it right into Wayne Tower,
along with the water and power utilities.

549
00:50:42,342 --> 00:50:45,680
Kind of made Wayne Tower
the unofficial center of Gotham City.

550
00:50:45,715 --> 00:50:48,524
Of course, Earle let it go to rot.
Here we are.

551
00:50:50,401 --> 00:50:52,524
Nomex survival suit
for advanced infantry.

552
00:50:52,737 --> 00:50:55,489
Kevlar biweave, reinforced joints.

553
00:50:55,823 --> 00:50:58,198
-Tear-resistant?
-This sucker will stop a knife.

554
00:50:58,233 --> 00:51:00,539
-Bulletproof?
-Anything but a straight shot.

555
00:51:00,574 --> 00:51:03,615
-Why didn't they put it into production?
-Bean counters didn't think...

556
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:06,161
...a soldier's life was worth 300 grand.

557
00:51:07,251 --> 00:51:10,702
So, what's your interest in it,
Mr. Wayne?

558
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:12,874
I want to borrow it.

559
00:51:12,909 --> 00:51:14,840
For spelunking.

560
00:51:15,718 --> 00:51:16,963
Spelunking?

561
00:51:16,998 --> 00:51:18,885
Yeah, you know, cave diving?

562
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:22,850
You expecting to run into
much gunfire in these caves?

563
00:51:25,185 --> 00:51:28,435
Look, I'd rather Mr. Earle
didn't know about me borrowing...

564
00:51:28,470 --> 00:51:29,850
Mr. Wayne...

565
00:51:30,065 --> 00:51:31,974
...the way I see it...

566
00:51:32,442 --> 00:51:34,898
...all this stuff is yours anyway.

567
00:51:37,864 --> 00:51:40,355
Okay. Give it a try.

568
00:51:44,496 --> 00:51:45,741
Charming.

569
00:51:48,583 --> 00:51:50,374
At least you'll have company.

570
00:51:52,253 --> 00:51:56,251
This must be the lowest foundation
of the southeast wing.

571
00:52:08,728 --> 00:52:12,891
Your great-great-grandfather was
involved in the Underground Railroad...

572
00:52:12,926 --> 00:52:16,066
...secretly transporting freed slaves
to the North...

573
00:52:16,101 --> 00:52:19,936
...and I suspect these caverns
came in handy.

574
00:52:32,626 --> 00:52:34,784
Alfred! Come up here!

575
00:52:35,003 --> 00:52:37,957
I can see everything all right
from down here, sir, thank you.

576
00:52:57,984 --> 00:53:00,653
We order the main part
of this cowl from Singapore.

577
00:53:00,688 --> 00:53:02,279
Via a dummy corporation.

578
00:53:02,314 --> 00:53:04,280
Indeed. And then, quite separately...

579
00:53:04,315 --> 00:53:09,448
...we place an order
to a Chinese company for these.

580
00:53:09,996 --> 00:53:12,915
-Put it together ourselves.
-Precisely.

581
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:17,168
They'll have to be large orders,
to avoid suspicion.

582
00:53:17,203 --> 00:53:19,874
-How large?
-Say 10,000.

583
00:53:22,383 --> 00:53:25,300
-Well, at least we'll have spares.
-Yes.

584
00:53:42,402 --> 00:53:44,443
Don't suppose you want a taste.

585
00:53:44,478 --> 00:53:47,821
I just keep offering,
thinking maybe someday you'll get wise.

586
00:53:47,856 --> 00:53:50,115
There's nothing wise
in what you do, Flass.

587
00:53:50,150 --> 00:53:53,696
Well, Jimbo, you don't take the taste,
makes us guys nervous.

588
00:53:53,731 --> 00:53:55,699
I'm no rat.

589
00:53:58,460 --> 00:54:02,160
In a town this bent,
who's there to rat to anyway?

590
00:54:31,867 --> 00:54:33,990
Don't turn around.

591
00:54:34,578 --> 00:54:37,663
You're a good cop.
One of the few.

592
00:54:38,332 --> 00:54:39,412
What do you want?

593
00:54:39,447 --> 00:54:42,792
Carmine Falcone brings
in shipments of drugs every week.

594
00:54:42,827 --> 00:54:44,753
Nobody takes him down. Why?

595
00:54:46,173 --> 00:54:48,296
He's paid up with the right people.

596
00:54:48,592 --> 00:54:51,379
What will it take to bring him down?

597
00:54:52,095 --> 00:54:54,503
Leverage on Judge Faden...

598
00:54:55,223 --> 00:54:57,596
...and a DA brave enough
to prosecute.

599
00:54:58,018 --> 00:54:59,642
Rachel Dawes.

600
00:55:00,228 --> 00:55:01,343
Who are you?

601
00:55:01,771 --> 00:55:03,396
Watch for my sign.

602
00:55:06,067 --> 00:55:08,107
You're just one man?

603
00:55:08,528 --> 00:55:09,939
Now we're two.

604
00:55:12,073 --> 00:55:12,855
We?

605
00:55:29,298 --> 00:55:31,042
Freeze!

606
00:55:48,233 --> 00:55:50,143
What the hell was that?

607
00:55:53,072 --> 00:55:54,270
Just some nut.

608
00:55:57,701 --> 00:56:00,488
Well, what is it today?
More spelunking?

609
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:03,153
No. Today it's BASE-jumping.

610
00:56:03,749 --> 00:56:05,373
BASE-jumping.

611
00:56:05,959 --> 00:56:08,497
-That like parachuting?
-Kind of.

612
00:56:09,713 --> 00:56:12,528
Do you have any lightweight fabrics?

613
00:56:12,563 --> 00:56:15,343
You know, I think I have just the thing.

614
00:56:16,678 --> 00:56:19,133
It's called memory cloth.
Notice anything?

615
00:56:22,475 --> 00:56:24,349
Regularly flexible...

616
00:56:24,769 --> 00:56:26,892
...but put a current through it...

617
00:56:28,356 --> 00:56:32,056
-...molecules realign, it becomes rigid.
-What kind of shapes can you make?

618
00:56:32,091 --> 00:56:35,354
Can be tailored to fit any structure
based on a rigid skeleton.

619
00:56:35,389 --> 00:56:36,693
Too expensive for the Army?

620
00:56:36,728 --> 00:56:41,651
I don't think they tried to market it
to the billionaire, BASE-jumping crowd.

621
00:56:41,686 --> 00:56:43,619
-Look, Mr. Fox.
-Yes, sir?

622
00:56:44,288 --> 00:56:45,628
If you're uncomfortable...

623
00:56:45,663 --> 00:56:49,034
Mr. Wayne, if you don't want to tell me
exactly what you're doing...

624
00:56:49,069 --> 00:56:51,167
...when I'm asked, I don't have to lie.

625
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:55,501
But don't think of me as an idiot.

626
00:56:57,009 --> 00:56:58,966
Fair enough.

627
00:57:00,888 --> 00:57:02,714
What's that?

628
00:57:04,808 --> 00:57:06,717
The Tumbler?

629
00:57:07,227 --> 00:57:09,184
Oh, you wouldn't be interested in that.

630
00:57:15,193 --> 00:57:17,102
She was built as a bridging vehicle.

631
00:57:19,072 --> 00:57:23,533
During combat, two of these
would jump over a river, towing cables.

632
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:29,697
Over here on the throttle,
flip that open and throttle up.

633
00:57:29,916 --> 00:57:32,454
This will boost you into a rampless jump...
Not now!

634
00:57:35,296 --> 00:57:37,419
Not... Not now, sir.

635
00:57:40,259 --> 00:57:42,133
Afterburner disengaged.

636
00:57:42,512 --> 00:57:45,548
We never could get
the damn bridge to work...

637
00:57:45,583 --> 00:57:47,431
...but this baby works just fine.

638
00:57:56,984 --> 00:57:58,229
So, what do you think?

639
00:57:59,487 --> 00:58:01,479
Does it come in black?

640
00:58:02,114 --> 00:58:04,486
I need you at the docks Thursday.

641
00:58:04,742 --> 00:58:06,615
-Problems?
-I don't want any trouble...

642
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:08,908
-...with the last shipment.
-Sure.

643
00:58:10,497 --> 00:58:14,162
Word on the street is you got a beef
with somebody in the DA's office.

644
00:58:14,197 --> 00:58:16,707
-Is that right?
-And that there's a fat prize...

645
00:58:16,742 --> 00:58:19,625
...waiting for anybody willing
to do anything about it.

646
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:21,755
So, what's your point, Mr. Flass?

647
00:58:22,217 --> 00:58:23,462
Have you seen the girl?

648
00:58:23,969 --> 00:58:26,603
It's a cute little assistant D A.

649
00:58:26,638 --> 00:58:30,470
Don't you think that's a little too much
heat to bring down, maybe?

650
00:58:30,505 --> 00:58:33,940
-Even for this town.
-Never underestimate Gotham City.

651
00:58:33,975 --> 00:58:36,980
People get mugged coming home
from work every day of the week.

652
00:58:37,015 --> 00:58:39,770
Sometimes...
Sometimes things just go bad.

653
00:58:43,655 --> 00:58:45,446
It's a problem with the graphite, sir.

654
00:58:45,657 --> 00:58:48,361
The next 10,000
will be up to specifications.

655
00:58:48,396 --> 00:58:51,031
-At least they gave us a discount.
-Quite.

656
00:58:51,066 --> 00:58:56,869
In the meantime, sir, may I suggest
you try to avoid landing on your head?

657
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:35,910
Why bats, Master Wayne?

658
00:59:36,164 --> 00:59:37,409
Bats frighten me.

659
00:59:38,708 --> 00:59:40,997
It's time my enemies shared my dread.

660
01:00:07,695 --> 01:00:09,604
What is this?

661
01:00:13,409 --> 01:00:14,737
Continue.

662
01:00:20,249 --> 01:00:21,909
Looks fine out there.

663
01:00:22,334 --> 01:00:24,208
The bears go straight to the dealers.

664
01:00:24,243 --> 01:00:27,054
Yeah, and the rabbits go
to the man in the Narrows.

665
01:00:27,089 --> 01:00:30,340
-What's the difference?
-Ignorance is bliss, my friend.

666
01:00:30,375 --> 01:00:33,592
Don't burden yourself
with these secrets of scary people.

667
01:00:49,444 --> 01:00:52,445
Hey. Steiss.

668
01:01:13,759 --> 01:01:15,218
Steiss?

669
01:01:27,147 --> 01:01:28,772
What?

670
01:01:29,483 --> 01:01:30,977
What the...?

671
01:01:39,993 --> 01:01:41,820
I better check it.

672
01:01:54,382 --> 01:01:56,375
There's a problem out here.
You better bail.

673
01:02:25,705 --> 01:02:27,033
Where are you?!

674
01:02:27,068 --> 01:02:28,237
Here.

675
01:02:49,603 --> 01:02:52,888
Take a ride. Oh, shit.

676
01:03:11,082 --> 01:03:12,825
What the hell are you?

677
01:03:16,254 --> 01:03:17,416
I'm Batman.

678
01:03:25,763 --> 01:03:27,720
Nice coat.

679
01:03:29,433 --> 01:03:30,975
Thanks.

680
01:04:12,017 --> 01:04:13,262
Hold it.

681
01:04:15,395 --> 01:04:17,850
That's right, you better run.

682
01:04:26,823 --> 01:04:28,649
Falcone sent them to kill you.

683
01:04:29,784 --> 01:04:32,357
-Why?
-You rattled his cage.

684
01:04:36,165 --> 01:04:37,672
-What's this?
-Leverage.

685
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:39,500
-For what?
-To get things moving.

686
01:04:39,794 --> 01:04:41,786
Who are you?

687
01:04:42,171 --> 01:04:43,381
Someone like you.

688
01:04:43,416 --> 01:04:45,629
Someone who'll rattle the cages.

689
01:04:50,721 --> 01:04:54,220
Ma'am? Everything okay?

690
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:00,999
-Falcone's men?
-Does it matter?

691
01:05:01,034 --> 01:05:03,478
We'll never tie him to it anyway.

692
01:05:03,692 --> 01:05:05,815
I wouldn't be too sure of that.

693
01:05:18,873 --> 01:05:20,700
What the hell is that?

694
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:31,546
Cut him down.

695
01:05:54,158 --> 01:05:55,368
Unacceptable.

696
01:05:55,403 --> 01:05:58,411
Now, I don't care if it's rival gangs,
Guardian Angels...

697
01:05:58,446 --> 01:06:00,536
...or the goddamn Salvation Army...

698
01:06:00,789 --> 01:06:03,115
...get them off the street
and off the front page.

699
01:06:03,150 --> 01:06:05,865
They say it was just one guy.
Or a creature.

700
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:08,749
It was some asshole in a costume.

701
01:06:09,256 --> 01:06:11,567
-Yeah?
-This guy did deliver us...

702
01:06:11,602 --> 01:06:13,843
...one of the city's biggest crime lords.

703
01:06:13,878 --> 01:06:17,552
No one takes the law
into their own hands in my city.

704
01:06:17,587 --> 01:06:18,886
Understand?

705
01:06:18,921 --> 01:06:21,934
No way to bury it now.
There's still Judge Faden.

706
01:06:21,969 --> 01:06:25,100
-I've got Faden covered.
-What about this bat they babble about?

707
01:06:25,135 --> 01:06:28,231
Even if these guys will swear
to being thrashed by a giant bat...

708
01:06:28,266 --> 01:06:30,523
...we've got Falcone at the scene.

709
01:06:30,558 --> 01:06:33,938
Drugs, prints, cargo manifests.
This bat character gave us everything.

710
01:06:34,364 --> 01:06:35,906
Okay. Let's do it.

711
01:06:39,327 --> 01:06:41,415
-Bats are nocturnal.
-Bats may be.

712
01:06:41,450 --> 01:06:45,037
But even for billionaire playboys,
3:00 is pushing it.

713
01:06:46,084 --> 01:06:48,954
The price for leading a double life,
I fear.

714
01:06:50,296 --> 01:06:52,704
Your theatrics made an impression.

715
01:06:54,091 --> 01:06:57,093
Theatricality and deception...

716
01:06:57,128 --> 01:07:00,298
...are powerful weapons, Alfred.
This is a good start.

717
01:07:00,333 --> 01:07:03,468
If those are to be the first
of many injuries to come...

718
01:07:03,503 --> 01:07:06,477
...it would be wise
to find a suitable excuse.

719
01:07:06,812 --> 01:07:08,105
Polo, for instance.

720
01:07:08,140 --> 01:07:09,973
I'm not learning polo, Alfred.

721
01:07:10,232 --> 01:07:13,897
Strange injuries,
a nonexistent social life.

722
01:07:13,932 --> 01:07:15,493
These things beg the question...

723
01:07:15,528 --> 01:07:19,943
...as to what exactly does Bruce Wayne
do with his time and his money.

724
01:07:19,978 --> 01:07:21,694
What does someone like me do?

725
01:07:22,661 --> 01:07:26,872
Drive sports cars, date movie stars.

726
01:07:27,541 --> 01:07:29,083
Buy things that are not for sale.

727
01:07:29,118 --> 01:07:32,827
Who knows, Master Wayne,
you start pretending to have fun...

728
01:07:33,463 --> 01:07:35,456
...you might even have a little
by accident.

729
01:07:38,176 --> 01:07:39,600
Sir.

730
01:07:39,635 --> 01:07:42,128
-We have a situation.
-All right.

731
01:07:42,514 --> 01:07:46,345
The Coast Guard picked up
one of our cargo ships last night...

732
01:07:46,893 --> 01:07:51,685
...heavily damaged, all crew missing,
probably dead.

733
01:07:53,733 --> 01:07:56,105
The ship was carrying
a prototype weapon.

734
01:07:56,319 --> 01:07:58,075
It's a microwave emitter.

735
01:07:58,110 --> 01:08:01,233
It's designed for desert warfare, but it...

736
01:08:02,908 --> 01:08:04,486
It looks like somebody...

737
01:08:08,873 --> 01:08:10,367
...turned it on.

738
01:08:14,545 --> 01:08:19,005
It uses focused microwaves to
vaporize the enemy's water supply.

739
01:08:26,932 --> 01:08:29,886
The damage to the ship
was catastrophic.

740
01:08:29,921 --> 01:08:33,061
The weapon itself is...

741
01:08:34,356 --> 01:08:35,850
Missing?

742
01:08:36,691 --> 01:08:37,936
Yeah.

743
01:08:39,236 --> 01:08:41,193
Mr. Wayne.

744
01:08:44,908 --> 01:08:46,331
Nice car.

745
01:08:46,366 --> 01:08:47,910
You should see my other one.

746
01:08:57,712 --> 01:08:59,835
He's done something
the police never have.

747
01:08:59,870 --> 01:09:02,476
You can't take the law
into your own hands.

748
01:09:02,511 --> 01:09:05,082
Well, at least he's getting
something done.

749
01:09:05,117 --> 01:09:07,551
-Bruce, help me out here.
-Huh?

750
01:09:07,586 --> 01:09:12,093
Well, a guy who dresses up
like a bat clearly has issues.

751
01:09:13,144 --> 01:09:15,350
But he's put Falcone behind bars.

752
01:09:15,385 --> 01:09:17,935
Now the cops want him.
What does that tell you?

753
01:09:17,970 --> 01:09:19,270
They're jealous.

754
01:09:19,305 --> 01:09:22,069
Sir, the pool is for decoration...

755
01:09:22,104 --> 01:09:25,646
...and your friends
do not have swimwear.

756
01:09:27,449 --> 01:09:29,442
Well, they're European.

757
01:09:31,286 --> 01:09:33,658
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

758
01:09:34,581 --> 01:09:38,032
-It is not a question of money.
-Well, you see...

759
01:09:38,627 --> 01:09:40,418
...I'm buying this hotel...

760
01:09:42,214 --> 01:09:46,626
...and setting some new rules
about the pool area.

761
01:09:47,802 --> 01:09:50,135
I think the Batman deserves a medal.

762
01:09:50,170 --> 01:09:52,469
And a straitjacket to pin it on.

763
01:09:58,980 --> 01:10:00,558
Thank you.

764
01:10:02,317 --> 01:10:03,645
Bruce?

765
01:10:07,238 --> 01:10:08,994
Rachel?

766
01:10:09,029 --> 01:10:10,609
I'd heard you were back.

767
01:10:12,660 --> 01:10:14,154
What are you doing?

768
01:10:14,912 --> 01:10:19,325
Just swimming here.
Wow, it is good to see you.

769
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:21,042
You were gone a long time.

770
01:10:21,627 --> 01:10:24,545
-I know. How are things?
-The same.

771
01:10:26,465 --> 01:10:28,090
Job's getting worse.

772
01:10:28,125 --> 01:10:31,005
Can't change the world on your own.

773
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:33,254
What choice do I have...

774
01:10:33,931 --> 01:10:35,674
...when you're too busy swimming?

775
01:10:37,017 --> 01:10:39,057
Rachel, all of...

776
01:10:39,353 --> 01:10:41,013
All this...

777
01:10:42,439 --> 01:10:46,484
It's... It's not me. It's...

778
01:10:46,902 --> 01:10:49,523
Inside, I am...

779
01:10:50,739 --> 01:10:52,696
I am more.

780
01:10:53,366 --> 01:10:54,874
Come on, Bruce. Come on.

781
01:10:54,909 --> 01:10:58,860
Bruce, we have
some more hotels for you to buy.

782
01:10:59,914 --> 01:11:01,373
Bruce...

783
01:11:02,542 --> 01:11:06,041
...deep down you may still be
that same great kid you used to be.

784
01:11:08,464 --> 01:11:11,038
But it's not who you are underneath...

785
01:11:11,509 --> 01:11:13,252
...it's what you do that defines you.

786
01:11:25,815 --> 01:11:28,126
Dr. Crane, thanks for coming.

787
01:11:28,161 --> 01:11:30,402
Not at all. He cut his wrists?

788
01:11:30,437 --> 01:11:34,276
Probably looking for the insanity plea.
But if anything should happen...

789
01:11:34,311 --> 01:11:37,402
Of course, better safe than sorry.

790
01:11:40,829 --> 01:11:44,412
Yeah, Dr. Crane, I can't take it anymore.
It's all too much.

791
01:11:44,447 --> 01:11:47,039
The walls are closing in.
Blah, blah, blah.

792
01:11:47,586 --> 01:11:50,077
A couple of days of this food,
it'll be true.

793
01:11:51,089 --> 01:11:52,714
-What do you want?
-I wanna know...

794
01:11:52,749 --> 01:11:55,415
...how you're gonna convince me
to keep my mouth shut.

795
01:11:55,450 --> 01:11:57,717
About what?
You don't know anything.

796
01:11:57,752 --> 01:12:02,093
I know you don't want the cops to take
a closer look at the drugs they seized.

797
01:12:02,128 --> 01:12:06,395
And I know about your experiments
with the inmates of your nut house.

798
01:12:06,430 --> 01:12:10,270
See, I don't go into business with a guy
without finding out his dirty secrets.

799
01:12:10,859 --> 01:12:13,741
And those goons you used.

800
01:12:13,776 --> 01:12:15,737
I own the muscle in this town.

801
01:12:15,772 --> 01:12:19,316
Now, I've been bringing
your stuff in for months...

802
01:12:19,867 --> 01:12:24,079
...so whatever he's planning,
it's big, and I want in.

803
01:12:25,373 --> 01:12:28,493
Well, I already know what he'll say.

804
01:12:28,918 --> 01:12:30,293
That we should kill you.

805
01:12:32,171 --> 01:12:35,457
Even he can't get me in here.
Not in my town.

806
01:12:41,430 --> 01:12:42,972
Would you like to see my mask?

807
01:12:44,516 --> 01:12:45,975
I use it in my experiments.

808
01:12:48,479 --> 01:12:52,939
Now, I'm probably not very frightening
to a guy like you.

809
01:12:53,317 --> 01:12:56,152
But these crazies, they can't stand it.

810
01:12:56,945 --> 01:12:59,021
So when did the nut
take over the nut house?

811
01:13:00,938 --> 01:13:03,073
They scream and they cry...

812
01:13:03,660 --> 01:13:05,285
...much as you're doing now.

813
01:13:07,622 --> 01:13:10,790
Well, he's not faking. Not that one.

814
01:13:10,825 --> 01:13:13,976
I'll talk to the judge
and see if I can get him moved...

815
01:13:14,011 --> 01:13:17,127
...to the secure wing at Arkham.
I can't treat him here.

816
01:13:39,153 --> 01:13:40,647
Storm's coming.

817
01:13:45,242 --> 01:13:48,594
The scum is getting jumpy
because you stood up to Falcone.

818
01:13:48,629 --> 01:13:51,947
It's a start. Your partner
was at the docks with Falcone.

819
01:13:51,982 --> 01:13:54,829
Well, he moonlights
as a low-level enforcer.

820
01:13:55,210 --> 01:13:58,994
They were splitting the shipment in two.
Only half went to the dealers.

821
01:13:59,029 --> 01:14:01,082
Why? What about the other half?

822
01:14:01,550 --> 01:14:03,957
-Flass knows.
-He won't talk.

823
01:14:04,595 --> 01:14:06,137
He'll talk to me.

824
01:14:06,172 --> 01:14:09,383
Commissioner Loeb set up
a massive task force to catch you.

825
01:14:09,850 --> 01:14:12,388
-He thinks you're dangerous.
-What do you think?

826
01:14:14,146 --> 01:14:16,553
I think you're trying to help.

827
01:14:21,569 --> 01:14:23,895
But I've been wrong before.

828
01:14:29,702 --> 01:14:31,410
Come on, I ain't got all night.

829
01:14:34,749 --> 01:14:36,576
Flass, I have kids to feed.

830
01:14:37,043 --> 01:14:39,201
What, they don't like falafel?

831
01:14:54,602 --> 01:14:56,310
Where were the other drugs going?

832
01:14:57,605 --> 01:14:59,728
I never knew. I don't know.

833
01:14:59,763 --> 01:15:02,147
-I swear to God.
-Swear to me!

834
01:15:07,781 --> 01:15:10,782
I don't... I don't know.
I never knew. Never.

835
01:15:11,076 --> 01:15:14,527
They went to some guy for a couple days
before they went to the dealers.

836
01:15:14,562 --> 01:15:15,985
Why?

837
01:15:16,665 --> 01:15:20,248
There was something...
Something else in the drugs...

838
01:15:20,283 --> 01:15:21,961
-...something hidden.
-What?

839
01:15:21,996 --> 01:15:25,477
I never went to the drop-off point.
It was in the Narrows.

840
01:15:25,512 --> 01:15:28,959
-Cops only go there in force.
-Do I look like a cop?

841
01:15:28,994 --> 01:15:30,927
No...!

842
01:15:44,525 --> 01:15:46,565
This is the one I'm talking about.

843
01:15:46,861 --> 01:15:49,115
-What's your problem with it?
-It shouldn't exist.

844
01:15:49,150 --> 01:15:52,441
This ship left Singapore with
246 containers, but arrived with 247.

845
01:15:52,476 --> 01:15:55,878
I'm guessing there's something
I'm not supposed to find in there.

846
01:15:55,913 --> 01:15:59,280
Listen, counselor, we don't wanna
know what's in Mr. Falcone's crate.

847
01:15:59,315 --> 01:16:02,790
Things are working a little
differently now. Open it up.

848
01:16:12,052 --> 01:16:13,333
What the hell is this?

849
01:16:56,220 --> 01:16:59,387
It's you, isn't it?
Everybody's been talking about you.

850
01:16:59,974 --> 01:17:01,717
Get in here!

851
01:17:02,351 --> 01:17:04,474
The other kids won't believe me.

852
01:17:27,584 --> 01:17:29,707
Get rid of all traces.

853
01:17:30,003 --> 01:17:32,921
Better torch the whole place.
All right.

854
01:18:08,958 --> 01:18:10,749
Having trouble?

855
01:18:11,460 --> 01:18:13,786
Take a seat. Have a drink.

856
01:18:14,505 --> 01:18:17,755
You look like a man
who takes himself too seriously.

857
01:18:21,470 --> 01:18:24,471
Do you want my opinion?
You need to lighten up.

858
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:20,141
Alfred, help me.

859
01:19:30,037 --> 01:19:33,406
Blood. Take. Take poison. Blood poison.

860
01:19:33,441 --> 01:19:36,583
Poisonous. Poisonous.

861
01:19:40,881 --> 01:19:42,589
Bruce...

862
01:19:43,884 --> 01:19:45,046
...why do we fall?

863
01:19:57,116 --> 01:20:00,449
-How long was I out?
-Two days.

864
01:20:00,827 --> 01:20:02,701
It's your birthday.

865
01:20:03,997 --> 01:20:05,278
Many happy returns.

866
01:20:10,462 --> 01:20:14,753
I've felt these effects before,
but this was so much more potent.

867
01:20:14,788 --> 01:20:19,044
It was some kind of hallucinogen,
weaponized, in aerosol form.

868
01:20:19,079 --> 01:20:22,139
You have been hanging out
in the wrong clubs, Mr. Wayne.

869
01:20:22,174 --> 01:20:25,433
I called Mr. Fox when your condition
worsened after the first day.

870
01:20:25,468 --> 01:20:26,942
I analyzed your blood...

871
01:20:26,977 --> 01:20:30,644
...isolating the receptor compounds
and the protein-based catalyst.

872
01:20:30,679 --> 01:20:32,606
Am I meant to understand any of that?

873
01:20:32,984 --> 01:20:36,150
Not at all. I just wanted you to know
how hard it was.

874
01:20:36,738 --> 01:20:40,438
-Bottom line, I synthesized an antidote.
-Could you make more?

875
01:20:40,473 --> 01:20:43,155
You planning on gassing yourself
again, Mr. Wayne?

876
01:20:43,190 --> 01:20:46,572
Well, you know how it is.
You're out at night, looking for kicks...

877
01:20:46,607 --> 01:20:49,464
...someone's passing around
the weaponized hallucinogens...

878
01:20:49,499 --> 01:20:53,118
I'll bring what I have.
The antidote should inoculate you for now.

879
01:20:53,153 --> 01:20:55,667
Alfred, always a pleasure.

880
01:20:55,702 --> 01:20:57,499
Lucius.

881
01:21:02,012 --> 01:21:04,681
-You sure you don't want to come in?
-I have to get back.

882
01:21:04,716 --> 01:21:06,556
-I wanted to leave this.
-Thank you.

883
01:21:06,591 --> 01:21:08,100
Rachel?

884
01:21:09,478 --> 01:21:12,519
Looks like someone's been
burning the candle at both ends.

885
01:21:12,554 --> 01:21:15,526
-Must've been quite an occasion.
-It is my birthday.

886
01:21:15,561 --> 01:21:19,399
I know. I'm sorry I can't come tonight.
I was just dropping off your present.

887
01:21:19,434 --> 01:21:22,940
-You've got better plans?
-My boss has been missing for days...

888
01:21:22,975 --> 01:21:25,441
...which means I should
probably start by looking...

889
01:21:25,476 --> 01:21:27,410
-...at the bottom of the river.
-Rachel.

890
01:21:28,610 --> 01:21:29,903
Excuse me.

891
01:21:31,458 --> 01:21:32,703
Rachel Dawes.

892
01:21:33,293 --> 01:21:37,124
Who authorized that? Get Crane down
there now. Don't take no for an answer.

893
01:21:37,159 --> 01:21:40,955
Call Dr. Lehmann, tell him we need our
own assessment to the judge by morning.

894
01:21:41,384 --> 01:21:43,176
-What's wrong?
-It's Falcone.

895
01:21:43,211 --> 01:21:46,133
Dr. Crane moved him to Arkham Asylum
on suicide watch.

896
01:21:46,168 --> 01:21:49,056
You're going to Arkham now?
It's in the Narrows, Rachel.

897
01:21:50,309 --> 01:21:52,101
You enjoy your party, Bruce.

898
01:21:52,136 --> 01:21:55,063
-Some of us have work to do.
-You be careful.

899
01:21:56,816 --> 01:21:58,393
Happy birthday.

900
01:22:17,794 --> 01:22:19,917
But, Master Wayne,
the guests will be arriving.

901
01:22:19,952 --> 01:22:22,020
Keep them happy until I arrive.

902
01:22:22,055 --> 01:22:24,088
Tell them that joke you know.

903
01:23:02,922 --> 01:23:04,630
Having fun?

904
01:23:06,759 --> 01:23:10,341
Bill? Now, what's a big shot like you
doing in a place like this?

905
01:23:10,376 --> 01:23:11,758
I need some information.

906
01:23:11,793 --> 01:23:16,764
The Wayne Enterprise 47-B, 1-ME.

907
01:23:18,062 --> 01:23:19,521
1-ME.

908
01:23:19,556 --> 01:23:23,478
It's a microwave emitter. It was designed
to vaporize an enemy's water supply.

909
01:23:23,513 --> 01:23:27,862
Rumor was they tested dispersing
water-based chemicals into the air...

910
01:23:27,897 --> 01:23:29,987
...but isn't that illegal?

911
01:23:31,700 --> 01:23:35,947
I want all the information
on the development of this project...

912
01:23:35,982 --> 01:23:40,118
...all data, files, backup disks,
on my desk right away.

913
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:42,160
Did you lose one?

914
01:23:43,211 --> 01:23:46,829
I'm merging your department
with Archives.

915
01:23:48,049 --> 01:23:49,330
And I am firing you.

916
01:23:51,469 --> 01:23:53,462
Didn't you get the memo?

917
01:24:00,686 --> 01:24:02,346
Scarecrow.

918
01:24:05,650 --> 01:24:07,523
Scarecrow.

919
01:24:10,863 --> 01:24:12,191
Scarecrow.

920
01:24:15,201 --> 01:24:17,372
Miss Dawes, this is most irregular.

921
01:24:17,407 --> 01:24:20,495
I have nothing to add
to the report I filed with the judge.

922
01:24:20,530 --> 01:24:22,871
-I have questions about your report.
-Such as?

923
01:24:22,906 --> 01:24:27,377
Isn't it convenient for a 52-year-old man
who has no history of mental illness...

924
01:24:27,412 --> 01:24:31,129
...to have a psychotic breakdown
just when he's about to be indicted?

925
01:24:31,164 --> 01:24:35,588
As you can see for yourself, there is
nothing convenient about his symptoms.

926
01:24:40,225 --> 01:24:41,636
-Scarecrow.
-What's "scarecrow"?

927
01:24:42,102 --> 01:24:45,720
Patients suffering delusional episodes
often focus their paranoia...

928
01:24:45,755 --> 01:24:47,985
...on an external tormentor...

929
01:24:48,020 --> 01:24:51,394
...usually one conforming
to Jungian archetypes.

930
01:24:51,611 --> 01:24:54,019
In this case, a scarecrow.

931
01:24:55,490 --> 01:24:59,618
-He's drugged?
-Psychopharmacology is my primary field.

932
01:24:59,653 --> 01:25:01,695
I'm a strong advocate.

933
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:04,251
Outside, he was a giant.

934
01:25:04,286 --> 01:25:06,912
In here, only the mind
can grant you power.

935
01:25:06,947 --> 01:25:08,793
You enjoy the reversal.

936
01:25:08,828 --> 01:25:12,004
I respect the mind's power
over the body.

937
01:25:12,039 --> 01:25:13,680
It's why I do what I do.

938
01:25:13,715 --> 01:25:17,986
I do what I do to keep thugs like Falcone
behind bars, not in therapy.

939
01:25:18,021 --> 01:25:22,257
I want my own psychiatric consultant
to have full access to Falcone...

940
01:25:22,292 --> 01:25:25,766
...including blood work.
Find out what exactly you put him on.

941
01:25:25,801 --> 01:25:28,392
-First thing tomorrow, then.
-Tonight.

942
01:25:28,427 --> 01:25:32,057
I've already paged Dr. Lehmann
at County General.

943
01:25:33,444 --> 01:25:35,270
As you wish.

944
01:25:40,784 --> 01:25:42,706
This way, please.

945
01:25:42,741 --> 01:25:45,532
There's something
I think you should see.

946
01:25:56,424 --> 01:25:59,046
This is where we make the medicine.

947
01:26:05,850 --> 01:26:09,764
Perhaps you should have some,
clear your head.

948
01:26:35,004 --> 01:26:36,628
Who knows you're here?

949
01:26:37,673 --> 01:26:39,297
Who knows?

950
01:26:46,515 --> 01:26:47,846
He's here.

951
01:26:47,881 --> 01:26:49,143
Who?

952
01:26:49,178 --> 01:26:51,308
The Batman.

953
01:26:53,105 --> 01:26:55,014
-What do we do?
-What anyone does...

954
01:26:55,049 --> 01:26:57,977
...when a prowler comes around.

955
01:26:58,902 --> 01:27:01,475
-Call the police.
-You want the cops here?

956
01:27:02,030 --> 01:27:04,782
At this point, they can't stop us.

957
01:27:04,817 --> 01:27:08,491
But the Batman
has a talent for disruption.

958
01:27:08,526 --> 01:27:11,362
Force him outside,
the police will take him down. Go.

959
01:27:11,397 --> 01:27:14,198
What about her?
She hasn't got long.

960
01:27:14,233 --> 01:27:16,297
I gave her a concentrated dose.

961
01:27:16,332 --> 01:27:19,076
The mind can only take so much.
Now go.

962
01:27:21,591 --> 01:27:23,879
The things they say about him.

963
01:27:23,914 --> 01:27:25,559
Can he really fly?

964
01:27:25,594 --> 01:27:28,322
I heard he can disappear.

965
01:27:28,357 --> 01:27:31,050
Well, we'll find out.

966
01:27:31,309 --> 01:27:32,969
Won't we?

967
01:28:20,273 --> 01:28:22,431
Taste of your own medicine, doctor?

968
01:28:29,073 --> 01:28:30,947
What have you been doing here?

969
01:28:34,036 --> 01:28:36,444
Who are you working for?

970
01:28:40,876 --> 01:28:43,214
Ra's... Ra's al Ghul.

971
01:28:43,249 --> 01:28:48,296
Ra's al Ghul is dead.
Who are you working for?

972
01:28:48,331 --> 01:28:49,498
Crane.

973
01:28:51,971 --> 01:28:54,924
Dr. Crane isn't here right now.

974
01:28:55,474 --> 01:28:57,383
But if you'd like to make
an appointment...

975
01:29:10,405 --> 01:29:13,323
Batman,
put down your weapons and surrender.

976
01:29:14,034 --> 01:29:15,445
You're surrounded.

977
01:29:20,999 --> 01:29:23,786
-What are you waiting for?
-Backup.

978
01:29:24,502 --> 01:29:26,875
-Backup?
-The Batman's in there.

979
01:29:26,910 --> 01:29:29,247
SWAT's on the way.
But if you wanna go in now...

980
01:29:29,282 --> 01:29:30,966
...I'll be right behind you, sir.

981
01:29:32,468 --> 01:29:34,011
SWAT's on the way.

982
01:29:35,096 --> 01:29:36,376
-Hey.
-Hey.

983
01:30:18,889 --> 01:30:20,597
What's happened to her?

984
01:30:23,268 --> 01:30:27,052
Crane poisoned her with a psychotropic
hallucinogen, a panic-inducing toxin.

985
01:30:29,065 --> 01:30:32,814
-Let me get her down to the medics.
-They can't help her, but I can.

986
01:30:36,739 --> 01:30:38,898
Get her downstairs.
Meet me in the alley.

987
01:30:46,874 --> 01:30:49,745
Crane's been smuggling his toxin
hidden in Falcone's drugs...

988
01:30:49,780 --> 01:30:52,077
...and they're dumping it
into the water supply.

989
01:30:52,588 --> 01:30:54,248
-What was he planning?
-I don't know.

990
01:30:54,465 --> 01:30:55,793
Was he working for Falcone?

991
01:30:56,258 --> 01:30:58,761
He mentioned someone else,
someone worse.

992
01:30:58,796 --> 01:31:01,543
She needs the antidote
before the damage is permanent.

993
01:31:01,578 --> 01:31:03,928
-How long does she have?
-Not long.

994
01:31:07,811 --> 01:31:09,603
What is that?

995
01:31:10,981 --> 01:31:13,270
-Backup.
-What the...?

996
01:32:31,476 --> 01:32:33,018
Excuse me.

997
01:32:37,774 --> 01:32:41,024
-How is she?
-She's fading. We gotta go.

998
01:32:42,862 --> 01:32:44,286
I'll get my car.

999
01:32:44,321 --> 01:32:46,316
I brought mine.

1000
01:32:46,700 --> 01:32:48,359
Yours?

1001
01:32:57,669 --> 01:32:59,495
I've gotta get me one of those.

1002
01:33:00,004 --> 01:33:01,298
He is in a vehicle.

1003
01:33:01,333 --> 01:33:03,374
Make and color?

1004
01:33:03,409 --> 01:33:05,416
It's a black...

1005
01:33:06,719 --> 01:33:08,047
...tank.

1006
01:33:10,681 --> 01:33:12,057
Stay calm.

1007
01:33:12,725 --> 01:33:14,516
You've been poisoned.

1008
01:33:17,229 --> 01:33:18,558
I'm on him.

1009
01:33:26,947 --> 01:33:28,026
Breathe slowly.

1010
01:33:38,125 --> 01:33:39,239
Hold on.

1011
01:33:53,723 --> 01:33:55,099
-What are you doing?
-Shortcut.

1012
01:34:03,191 --> 01:34:05,896
Air One to ground, block that ramp.

1013
01:34:09,947 --> 01:34:11,572
He's got no way off that roof.

1014
01:34:12,950 --> 01:34:16,070
Turn off your engine.
Step away from the car.

1015
01:34:18,414 --> 01:34:21,201
-Trust me.
-Weapons system activated.

1016
01:34:39,101 --> 01:34:40,097
Who is this guy?

1017
01:34:40,132 --> 01:34:41,654
Where's he going?

1018
01:34:41,689 --> 01:34:43,177
He's on the roof.

1019
01:34:56,826 --> 01:34:59,496
-What street is he taking?
-He's not on a street.

1020
01:34:59,531 --> 01:35:00,943
He's flying on rooftops.

1021
01:35:40,160 --> 01:35:42,402
At least tell me what it looks like.

1022
01:35:45,416 --> 01:35:46,874
Never mind.

1023
01:35:50,754 --> 01:35:52,129
Got him.

1024
01:36:03,016 --> 01:36:04,594
Coming right up on his butt.

1025
01:36:29,292 --> 01:36:32,495
We're tracking suspect
vehicle heading west on I-17.

1026
01:36:37,008 --> 01:36:38,680
-Air One to ground.
-I lost him.

1027
01:36:38,715 --> 01:36:40,925
We've lost visual. Exit 9 is blocked.

1028
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:43,046
We'll loop back to check
the frontage road.

1029
01:36:43,081 --> 01:36:45,214
Stealth mode activated.

1030
01:36:45,849 --> 01:36:47,094
Stay with me.

1031
01:36:53,273 --> 01:36:54,768
What...? There he is.

1032
01:37:14,461 --> 01:37:15,919
Just hold on.

1033
01:37:19,883 --> 01:37:21,081
Rachel!

1034
01:37:53,207 --> 01:37:55,330
They get any of this into the mains?

1035
01:37:55,365 --> 01:37:56,497
Yeah.

1036
01:37:56,532 --> 01:37:59,457
Notify the water company.
There's gotta be a way to isolate it.

1037
01:37:59,492 --> 01:38:02,347
No. They put it all in.
They must've been at this for weeks.

1038
01:38:02,382 --> 01:38:06,049
-Gotham's entire water supply is laced.
-Why haven't we felt the effects?

1039
01:38:06,084 --> 01:38:08,508
Must be a compound that
has to be absorbed through the lungs.

1040
01:38:18,732 --> 01:38:20,440
How do you feel?

1041
01:38:23,194 --> 01:38:24,689
Where are we?

1042
01:38:25,196 --> 01:38:28,980
-Why did you bring me here?
-If I hadn't, your mind would be lost.

1043
01:38:29,015 --> 01:38:31,163
-You were poisoned.
-It was...

1044
01:38:31,198 --> 01:38:34,987
-It was Dr. Crane.
-Rest. Gordon has Crane.

1045
01:38:35,022 --> 01:38:37,287
Is Sergeant Gordon your friend?

1046
01:38:38,126 --> 01:38:39,786
I don't have the luxury of friends.

1047
01:38:40,670 --> 01:38:43,968
I'm gonna give you a sedative.
You'll wake up back at home.

1048
01:38:44,003 --> 01:38:48,123
When you do, get these to Gordon,
and Gordon alone. Trust no one.

1049
01:38:48,158 --> 01:38:50,011
-What are they?
-The antidote.

1050
01:38:50,046 --> 01:38:53,554
One for Gordon to inoculate himself,
the other for mass production.

1051
01:38:53,933 --> 01:38:55,178
Mass production?

1052
01:38:55,213 --> 01:38:58,559
Crane was just a pawn.
We need to be ready.

1053
01:39:24,504 --> 01:39:27,885
When you told me your grand plan
for saving Gotham...

1054
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:31,008
...all that stopped me
from calling the men in white coats...

1055
01:39:31,043 --> 01:39:33,668
...was when you said
it wasn't about thrill-seeking.

1056
01:39:33,703 --> 01:39:36,883
-It's not.
-What would you call that?

1057
01:39:38,726 --> 01:39:41,997
-Damn good television.
-It's a miracle no one was killed.

1058
01:39:42,032 --> 01:39:45,269
I didn't have time to observe
the rules of the road, Alfred.

1059
01:39:45,304 --> 01:39:48,526
You're getting lost inside
this monster of yours.

1060
01:39:48,561 --> 01:39:53,149
I'm using this monster to help
other people, just like my father did.

1061
01:39:53,184 --> 01:39:54,867
For Thomas Wayne, helping others...

1062
01:39:54,902 --> 01:39:57,993
...wasn't about proving anything
to anyone, including himself.

1063
01:39:58,454 --> 01:40:01,823
It's Rachel, Alfred. She was dying.

1064
01:40:02,249 --> 01:40:04,871
She's downstairs, sedated.
I need you to take her home.

1065
01:40:05,169 --> 01:40:08,787
Well, we both care for Rachel, but what
you're doing has to be beyond that.

1066
01:40:09,089 --> 01:40:12,007
It can't be personal,
or you're just a vigilante.

1067
01:40:12,042 --> 01:40:13,960
-Is Fox still here?
-Yes, sir.

1068
01:40:13,995 --> 01:40:15,844
We need to send these people away.

1069
01:40:15,879 --> 01:40:19,008
Those are Bruce Wayne's guests.
You have a name to maintain.

1070
01:40:19,043 --> 01:40:20,974
I don't care about my name.

1071
01:40:21,009 --> 01:40:24,351
It's not just your name, sir.
It's your father's name.

1072
01:40:26,106 --> 01:40:28,478
And it's all that's left of him.

1073
01:40:30,402 --> 01:40:31,979
Don't destroy it.

1074
01:40:47,293 --> 01:40:49,452
-Mr. Earle.
-Happy birthday, Bruce.

1075
01:40:49,487 --> 01:40:51,040
Thank you.

1076
01:40:51,339 --> 01:40:53,378
How did the stock offering go?

1077
01:40:53,633 --> 01:40:54,943
Prices soared.

1078
01:40:54,978 --> 01:40:56,219
Who was buying?

1079
01:40:56,254 --> 01:40:58,336
All kinds of funds and brokerages.

1080
01:40:58,371 --> 01:41:00,234
It's a bit technical.

1081
01:41:00,269 --> 01:41:02,062
The key thing is...

1082
01:41:02,097 --> 01:41:04,259
...our company's future is secure.

1083
01:41:06,103 --> 01:41:07,135
Great.

1084
01:41:20,868 --> 01:41:23,156
A little the worse for wear, I'm afraid.

1085
01:41:28,876 --> 01:41:30,632
What was the plan, Crane?

1086
01:41:30,667 --> 01:41:33,078
How were you gonna get
your toxin into the air?

1087
01:41:33,463 --> 01:41:36,714
Scarecrow. Scarecrow.

1088
01:41:36,749 --> 01:41:38,752
Who were you working for, Crane?

1089
01:41:40,846 --> 01:41:43,052
Oh, it's too late.

1090
01:41:43,640 --> 01:41:45,763
You can't stop it now.

1091
01:41:50,814 --> 01:41:52,321
Here.

1092
01:41:52,356 --> 01:41:54,600
-Happy birthday, Bruce.
-Thank you. Thanks.

1093
01:41:54,635 --> 01:41:57,611
And thank you for that item.

1094
01:41:59,113 --> 01:42:00,323
You're welcome.

1095
01:42:00,358 --> 01:42:03,319
-I know you'll put it to good use.
-I already have.

1096
01:42:03,576 --> 01:42:07,408
How long would it take
to manufacture on a large scale?

1097
01:42:07,955 --> 01:42:09,035
Weeks. Why?

1098
01:42:09,070 --> 01:42:12,415
Somebody's planning to disperse
the toxin using the water supply.

1099
01:42:13,419 --> 01:42:16,503
The water supply won't help you
disperse an inhalant.

1100
01:42:17,423 --> 01:42:18,799
What?

1101
01:42:18,834 --> 01:42:21,546
Unless you have a microwave emitter
powerful enough...

1102
01:42:21,581 --> 01:42:24,589
...to vaporize all the water
in the mains.

1103
01:42:25,014 --> 01:42:28,299
A microwave emitter like the one
Wayne Enterprises just misplaced.

1104
01:42:28,726 --> 01:42:29,889
Misplaced?

1105
01:42:29,924 --> 01:42:33,601
Earle just fired me for asking
too many questions about it.

1106
01:42:35,607 --> 01:42:39,107
Go back to Wayne Enterprises now
and start making more of that antidote.

1107
01:42:39,142 --> 01:42:42,397
The police are gonna need as much
as they can get their hands on.

1108
01:42:42,432 --> 01:42:44,613
My security clearance
has been revoked.

1109
01:42:44,648 --> 01:42:46,817
That wouldn't stop a man like you,
would it?

1110
01:42:47,244 --> 01:42:48,952
I suppose not.

1111
01:42:50,997 --> 01:42:55,659
-Bruce, there's somebody you must meet.
-Not now, Mrs. Delane.

1112
01:42:55,694 --> 01:42:58,706
Now, am I pronouncing this right...

1113
01:42:58,741 --> 01:43:01,336
...Mr. Ra's al Ghul?

1114
01:43:06,971 --> 01:43:08,763
You're not Ra's al Ghul.

1115
01:43:10,308 --> 01:43:11,553
I watched him die.

1116
01:43:11,588 --> 01:43:14,804
But is Ra's al Ghul immortal?

1117
01:43:17,565 --> 01:43:20,020
Are his methods supernatural?

1118
01:43:24,572 --> 01:43:28,984
Or cheap parlor tricks to conceal
your true identity, Ra's?

1119
01:43:30,828 --> 01:43:35,324
Surely a man who spends his nights
scrambling over the rooftops of Gotham...

1120
01:43:35,359 --> 01:43:37,539
...wouldn't begrudge me dual identities.

1121
01:43:38,377 --> 01:43:40,133
I saved your life.

1122
01:43:40,168 --> 01:43:42,828
I warned you about compassion, Bruce.

1123
01:43:46,009 --> 01:43:48,216
Your quarrel is with me.

1124
01:43:49,096 --> 01:43:51,587
You let these people go.

1125
01:43:51,848 --> 01:43:55,134
You are welcome to explain
the situation to them.

1126
01:43:57,395 --> 01:43:59,020
Everyone.

1127
01:43:59,814 --> 01:44:01,688
Everybody?

1128
01:44:04,277 --> 01:44:06,151
I...

1129
01:44:06,613 --> 01:44:10,860
I want to thank you all for coming here
tonight and drinking all of my booze.

1130
01:44:12,952 --> 01:44:14,660
No, really.

1131
01:44:15,705 --> 01:44:18,422
There's a thing about being a Wayne...

1132
01:44:18,457 --> 01:44:22,250
...that you're never short of
a few freeloaders, like yourselves...

1133
01:44:22,285 --> 01:44:26,043
...to fill up your mansion with.
So here's to you people. Thank you.

1134
01:44:26,078 --> 01:44:28,836
-That's enough, Bruce.
-I'm not finished.

1135
01:44:29,176 --> 01:44:30,849
To all of you...

1136
01:44:30,884 --> 01:44:35,395
All of you phonies,
all of you two-faced friends...

1137
01:44:35,430 --> 01:44:40,676
...you sycophantic suck-ups
who smile through your teeth at me...

1138
01:44:40,711 --> 01:44:44,437
...please, leave me in peace.

1139
01:44:44,472 --> 01:44:47,229
Please go.

1140
01:44:47,569 --> 01:44:50,985
Stop smiling, it's not a joke.
Please leave.

1141
01:44:51,020 --> 01:44:53,328
The party's over, get out.

1142
01:44:53,363 --> 01:44:56,784
The apple has fallen very far
from the tree, Mr. Wayne.

1143
01:45:01,625 --> 01:45:03,913
He's turning into a jerk.

1144
01:45:10,216 --> 01:45:11,960
Amusing.

1145
01:45:12,260 --> 01:45:15,711
But pointless.
None of these people have long to live.

1146
01:45:15,746 --> 01:45:19,388
Your antics at the asylum
have forced my hand.

1147
01:45:19,423 --> 01:45:21,682
So Crane was working for you.

1148
01:45:21,717 --> 01:45:25,726
His toxin is derived from the organic
compound found in our blue flowers.

1149
01:45:26,065 --> 01:45:28,070
He was able to weaponize it.

1150
01:45:28,105 --> 01:45:30,233
He's not a member of
the League of Shadows?

1151
01:45:30,268 --> 01:45:34,987
Of course not. He thought our plan
was to hold the city to ransom.

1152
01:45:35,700 --> 01:45:40,243
But really, you are gonna release
Crane's poison on the entire city.

1153
01:45:40,278 --> 01:45:44,457
Then watch Gotham tear itself apart
through fear.

1154
01:45:57,096 --> 01:45:59,218
You're gonna destroy millions of lives.

1155
01:45:59,431 --> 01:46:02,882
Only a cynical man would call
what these people have "lives," Wayne.

1156
01:46:02,917 --> 01:46:04,733
Crime. Despair.

1157
01:46:04,768 --> 01:46:07,012
This is not how man
was supposed to live.

1158
01:46:07,647 --> 01:46:10,814
The League of Shadows has been
a check against human corruption...

1159
01:46:10,849 --> 01:46:12,443
...for thousands of years.

1160
01:46:12,478 --> 01:46:16,235
We sacked Rome.
Loaded trade ships with plague rats.

1161
01:46:16,270 --> 01:46:17,782
Burned London to the ground.

1162
01:46:17,817 --> 01:46:20,826
Every time a civilization reaches
the pinnacle of its decadence...

1163
01:46:20,861 --> 01:46:22,951
...we return to restore the balance.

1164
01:46:22,986 --> 01:46:24,698
Gotham isn't beyond saving.

1165
01:46:25,999 --> 01:46:28,703
Give me more time.
There are good people here.

1166
01:46:28,738 --> 01:46:30,668
You're defending a city so corrupt...

1167
01:46:30,703 --> 01:46:34,045
...we have infiltrated
every level of its infrastructure.

1168
01:46:45,142 --> 01:46:46,518
Time to play.

1169
01:46:50,689 --> 01:46:53,359
When I found you in that jail,
you were lost.

1170
01:46:53,394 --> 01:46:55,613
But I believed in you.

1171
01:46:55,648 --> 01:46:59,568
I took away your fear,
and I showed you a path.

1172
01:46:59,823 --> 01:47:02,065
You were my greatest student.

1173
01:47:02,368 --> 01:47:05,534
It should be you standing by my side,
saving the world.

1174
01:47:06,330 --> 01:47:08,951
I'll be standing where I belong.

1175
01:47:09,583 --> 01:47:12,703
Between you
and the people of Gotham.

1176
01:47:14,379 --> 01:47:17,001
No one can save Gotham.

1177
01:47:20,343 --> 01:47:25,005
When a forest grows too wild,
a purging fire is inevitable and natural.

1178
01:47:26,224 --> 01:47:30,886
Tomorrow the world will watch in horror
as its greatest city destroys itself.

1179
01:47:31,438 --> 01:47:34,688
The movement back to harmony
will be unstoppable this time.

1180
01:47:34,983 --> 01:47:37,189
-You attacked Gotham before?
-Of course.

1181
01:47:37,402 --> 01:47:40,071
Over the ages our weapons
have grown more sophisticated.

1182
01:47:40,106 --> 01:47:43,108
With Gotham we tried a new one.
Economics.

1183
01:47:43,533 --> 01:47:48,241
But we underestimated certain
of Gotham's citizens...

1184
01:47:48,663 --> 01:47:50,869
...such as your parents.

1185
01:47:54,919 --> 01:47:58,418
Gunned down by one of the very people
they were trying to help.

1186
01:47:58,672 --> 01:48:01,380
Create enough hunger
and everyone becomes a criminal.

1187
01:48:01,415 --> 01:48:04,089
Their deaths galvanized the city
into saving itself...

1188
01:48:04,124 --> 01:48:06,966
...and Gotham has limped on
ever since.

1189
01:48:07,001 --> 01:48:08,930
We are back to finish the job.

1190
01:48:09,641 --> 01:48:12,857
And this time no misguided idealists
will get in the way.

1191
01:48:12,892 --> 01:48:16,644
Like your father, you lack the courage
to do all that is necessary.

1192
01:48:16,940 --> 01:48:19,776
If someone stands in the way
of true justice...

1193
01:48:19,811 --> 01:48:24,065
...you simply walk up behind them
and stab them in the heart.

1194
01:48:29,077 --> 01:48:31,235
-I am gonna stop you.
-You never did learn...

1195
01:48:31,270 --> 01:48:33,452
...to mind your surroundings.

1196
01:48:35,625 --> 01:48:37,583
Justice is balance.

1197
01:48:37,618 --> 01:48:39,952
You burned my house
and left me for dead.

1198
01:48:42,632 --> 01:48:44,790
Consider us even.

1199
01:49:01,192 --> 01:49:02,935
No one comes out. Make sure.

1200
01:49:12,828 --> 01:49:14,252
They're all gone?

1201
01:49:14,287 --> 01:49:17,206
-How many from maximum security?
-Every one of them.

1202
01:49:17,241 --> 01:49:19,166
Serial killers, rapists.

1203
01:49:19,376 --> 01:49:22,211
Raise the bridges.
We don't want any getting off the island.

1204
01:49:22,246 --> 01:49:24,004
Yeah, I'll raise the bridges...

1205
01:49:24,039 --> 01:49:28,259
...when I get every available unit out here
to catch the homicidal maniacs...

1206
01:49:28,294 --> 01:49:31,297
-...that are running loose out there.
-Come on!

1207
01:49:54,494 --> 01:49:57,245
I hope you're not a member
of the fire brigade.

1208
01:50:03,252 --> 01:50:05,375
Master Wayne! Master Wayne!

1209
01:50:09,884 --> 01:50:14,261
What is the point of all those pushups
if you can't even lift a bloody log?

1210
01:50:52,717 --> 01:50:54,793
What have I done, Alfred?

1211
01:50:55,804 --> 01:50:57,822
Everything my family...

1212
01:50:57,857 --> 01:50:59,840
...my father, built...

1213
01:51:02,226 --> 01:51:06,141
The Wayne legacy is more
than bricks and mortar, sir.

1214
01:51:06,176 --> 01:51:08,556
I wanted to save Gotham.

1215
01:51:09,400 --> 01:51:11,274
I failed.

1216
01:51:12,486 --> 01:51:13,767
Why do we fall, sir?

1217
01:51:16,949 --> 01:51:20,448
So that we can learn
to pick ourselves up.

1218
01:51:22,913 --> 01:51:25,072
You still haven't given up on me?

1219
01:51:26,959 --> 01:51:28,453
Never.

1220
01:51:29,503 --> 01:51:30,796
Down!

1221
01:51:30,831 --> 01:51:33,887
Harassment! I see harassment!

1222
01:51:33,922 --> 01:51:36,167
Maybe you'd like to see
some excessive force?

1223
01:51:36,202 --> 01:51:38,252
Madman with a gun.

1224
01:51:39,304 --> 01:51:40,977
With residents furious...

1225
01:51:41,012 --> 01:51:44,348
...at the unprecedented show of police
strength to round up the inmates...

1226
01:51:44,383 --> 01:51:46,310
We're about to raise these bridges.

1227
01:51:46,345 --> 01:51:50,138
Officer, I am a Gotham City
district attorney. Let me pass.

1228
01:51:57,530 --> 01:51:59,507
-Just shut up!
-Hey, Flass, cool it!

1229
01:51:59,542 --> 01:52:01,450
Hold these people back.

1230
01:52:01,485 --> 01:52:04,412
Hey, Gordon.
Somebody here to see you.

1231
01:52:04,447 --> 01:52:07,028
-What are you doing here?
-Our friend sent me with this.

1232
01:52:07,063 --> 01:52:08,695
It counteracts Crane's toxin.

1233
01:52:08,730 --> 01:52:10,292
Hopefully you won't need it.

1234
01:52:10,327 --> 01:52:13,668
Not unless he's got some way
of getting that crap into the air.

1235
01:52:14,797 --> 01:52:17,253
All right, last one across.

1236
01:52:17,925 --> 01:52:21,805
People, they want this
bridge up in no more than three minutes!

1237
01:52:21,840 --> 01:52:25,428
Better get you off the island before
they raise the bridges. Patrolman!

1238
01:52:26,058 --> 01:52:27,089
Go!

1239
01:52:53,877 --> 01:52:55,704
I can't find my mom.

1240
01:52:56,046 --> 01:52:57,540
Hey!

1241
01:53:05,930 --> 01:53:07,674
What the hell are you doing?

1242
01:53:09,184 --> 01:53:10,761
Gentlemen...

1243
01:53:11,186 --> 01:53:13,723
...time to spread the word.

1244
01:53:15,440 --> 01:53:16,850
And the word is...

1245
01:53:18,067 --> 01:53:19,859
...panic.

1246
01:53:43,842 --> 01:53:45,385
Jesus. The pressure, it's spiking.

1247
01:53:46,584 --> 01:53:47,877
Right there.

1248
01:53:48,180 --> 01:53:50,422
That water main
is right under the Narrows.

1249
01:54:07,365 --> 01:54:08,943
It's okay.

1250
01:54:41,774 --> 01:54:43,483
This is Commissioner Loeb.

1251
01:54:43,518 --> 01:54:45,192
Come on, somebody talk to me.

1252
01:54:45,227 --> 01:54:46,820
Come on!

1253
01:55:06,506 --> 01:55:08,546
Loeb, Loeb. This is Gordon.

1254
01:55:08,842 --> 01:55:10,135
What the hell is going on?

1255
01:55:10,170 --> 01:55:13,760
We need reinforcements.
TAC teams, SWAT, riot cops!

1256
01:55:13,795 --> 01:55:17,408
Gordon! All the city's riot police
are on the island with you!

1257
01:55:17,443 --> 01:55:20,986
Well, they're completely incapacitated!

1258
01:55:21,021 --> 01:55:24,687
It's okay, it's okay.
No one's gonna hurt you.

1259
01:55:25,525 --> 01:55:27,150
Of course they are!

1260
01:55:27,185 --> 01:55:30,361
-Crane?
-No. Scarecrow.

1261
01:55:32,115 --> 01:55:33,490
Gordon...

1262
01:55:33,525 --> 01:55:35,941
...there's nobody left to send in.

1263
01:55:37,495 --> 01:55:39,203
So I'm on my own?

1264
01:55:43,292 --> 01:55:44,917
The Narrows is tearing itself to pieces.

1265
01:55:44,952 --> 01:55:47,792
This is just the beginning.
If they hit the whole city...

1266
01:55:47,827 --> 01:55:50,632
...there's nothing to stop Gotham
tearing itself apart.

1267
01:55:50,667 --> 01:55:52,674
-How are they gonna do that?
-The train.

1268
01:55:52,709 --> 01:55:56,717
The monorail follows the water mains to
the central hub beneath Wayne Tower.

1269
01:55:56,752 --> 01:55:58,562
If the machine gets to the station...

1270
01:55:58,597 --> 01:56:02,265
...it'll cause a chain reaction
that'll vaporize the city's water supply.

1271
01:56:02,300 --> 01:56:03,979
Covering Gotham in this poison.

1272
01:56:04,014 --> 01:56:07,391
I'm gonna stop him from loading
that train, but I may need your help.

1273
01:56:07,426 --> 01:56:09,357
-What do you need?
-Can you drive stick?

1274
01:56:15,615 --> 01:56:17,240
There you are!

1275
01:56:17,275 --> 01:56:19,443
There is nothing to fear...

1276
01:56:19,478 --> 01:56:21,363
...but fear itself!

1277
01:56:22,414 --> 01:56:24,157
I am here to help you!

1278
01:56:55,947 --> 01:56:58,105
Batman will save us. He'll come.

1279
01:57:03,329 --> 01:57:05,238
-He'll come.
-Don't peek.

1280
01:57:13,881 --> 01:57:17,250
This is Gordon.
Prepare to lower the bridge.

1281
01:57:23,140 --> 01:57:25,263
I told you he'd come.

1282
01:57:30,272 --> 01:57:31,896
Wait.

1283
01:57:32,858 --> 01:57:34,447
You could die.

1284
01:57:34,482 --> 01:57:35,931
At least tell me your name.

1285
01:57:41,324 --> 01:57:43,530
It's not who I am underneath...

1286
01:57:44,494 --> 01:57:48,906
...but what I do that defines me.

1287
01:57:49,165 --> 01:57:50,493
Bruce?

1288
01:58:24,199 --> 01:58:27,533
Well, well. You took my advice
about theatricality a bit literally.

1289
01:58:27,568 --> 01:58:30,132
-It ends here.
-For you and the police, maybe.

1290
01:58:30,167 --> 01:58:33,187
My fight, however,
lies with the rest of Gotham.

1291
01:58:33,222 --> 01:58:36,650
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a city to destroy.

1292
01:58:36,685 --> 01:58:40,078
-I can't beat two of your pawns?
-As you wish.

1293
01:58:52,894 --> 01:58:55,219
GPS online.

1294
01:59:02,070 --> 01:59:04,276
In 100 yards.

1295
01:59:35,143 --> 01:59:36,424
Gentlemen.

1296
02:00:03,838 --> 02:00:06,080
Who the hell authorized this?

1297
02:00:16,642 --> 02:00:18,718
Distance to Wayne Tower, three miles.

1298
02:00:25,985 --> 02:00:28,606
The pressure's moving along the mains,
blowing the pipes.

1299
02:00:28,641 --> 02:00:30,119
If that pressure reaches us...

1300
02:00:30,154 --> 02:00:33,323
...the water supply right across
the whole city is gonna blow!

1301
02:00:43,794 --> 02:00:46,664
At the next intersection, turn right.

1302
02:01:11,362 --> 02:01:12,821
You will never learn.

1303
02:01:20,371 --> 02:01:21,402
Sorry.

1304
02:01:25,376 --> 02:01:28,377
-Familiar. Don't you have anything new?
-How about this?!

1305
02:01:45,145 --> 02:01:47,434
You have arrived at Wayne Tower.

1306
02:02:00,744 --> 02:02:01,989
Evacuate the building.

1307
02:02:02,204 --> 02:02:04,695
We're on top of the main hub
and it's gonna blow.

1308
02:02:13,590 --> 02:02:15,796
Weapons system activated.

1309
02:02:19,887 --> 02:02:20,919
Nice ride.

1310
02:02:36,153 --> 02:02:37,185
Armed.

1311
02:02:49,124 --> 02:02:50,583
Don't be afraid, Bruce.

1312
02:02:53,378 --> 02:02:54,754
Come on. Come on.

1313
02:02:59,509 --> 02:03:01,550
You are just an ordinary man in a cape.

1314
02:03:01,585 --> 02:03:05,629
That's why you couldn't fight injustice,
that's why you can't stop this train.

1315
02:03:05,664 --> 02:03:08,381
Who said anything about stopping it?

1316
02:03:14,190 --> 02:03:15,733
Yes!

1317
02:03:23,908 --> 02:03:27,324
You never learned
to mind your surroundings!

1318
02:03:35,169 --> 02:03:37,660
Have you finally learned to do
what is necessary?

1319
02:03:37,964 --> 02:03:40,252
I won't kill you...

1320
02:03:44,679 --> 02:03:46,837
...but I don't have to save you.

1321
02:05:02,004 --> 02:05:05,088
-The meeting's already started.
-What meeting?

1322
02:05:09,344 --> 02:05:12,262
Fox, I seem to remember firing you.

1323
02:05:12,764 --> 02:05:14,307
You did.

1324
02:05:14,342 --> 02:05:16,592
I got another job.

1325
02:05:17,436 --> 02:05:18,894
Yours.

1326
02:05:19,354 --> 02:05:21,062
On whose authority?

1327
02:05:21,565 --> 02:05:23,569
Batman may
have made the front page...

1328
02:05:23,604 --> 02:05:26,729
...but Bruce Wayne
got pushed to page eight.

1329
02:05:33,535 --> 02:05:34,531
Bruce Wayne.

1330
02:05:34,566 --> 02:05:38,071
What makes you think you can decide
who's running Wayne Enterprises?

1331
02:05:38,106 --> 02:05:41,577
-The fact that I'm the owner.
-What are you talking about?

1332
02:05:41,612 --> 02:05:43,432
The company went public a week ago.

1333
02:05:43,467 --> 02:05:45,253
And I bought most of the shares.

1334
02:05:45,630 --> 02:05:49,081
Through various charitable foundations
and trusts and so forth.

1335
02:05:49,116 --> 02:05:52,462
Look, it's all a bit technical,
but the important thing...

1336
02:05:52,678 --> 02:05:55,964
...is that my company's future
is secure.

1337
02:05:56,349 --> 02:05:57,724
Right, Mr. Fox?

1338
02:05:57,759 --> 02:05:59,760
Right you are, Mr. Wayne.

1339
02:06:01,979 --> 02:06:03,557
Didn't you get the memo?

1340
02:06:22,499 --> 02:06:25,702
-I'm sorry I didn't tell you, Rachel.
-No. No, Bruce...

1341
02:06:25,737 --> 02:06:27,253
...I'm sorry.

1342
02:06:28,130 --> 02:06:30,799
The day that Chill died, I...

1343
02:06:32,676 --> 02:06:34,300
I said terrible things.

1344
02:06:34,803 --> 02:06:36,546
But true things.

1345
02:06:37,180 --> 02:06:38,972
I was a coward with a gun...

1346
02:06:39,007 --> 02:06:42,966
...and justice is about more
than revenge, so thank you.

1347
02:06:44,020 --> 02:06:46,689
I never stopped thinking about you.

1348
02:06:48,191 --> 02:06:49,815
About us.

1349
02:06:50,443 --> 02:06:52,400
And when I heard you were back, I...

1350
02:06:53,237 --> 02:06:55,444
I started to hope.

1351
02:07:19,513 --> 02:07:22,218
But then I found out about your mask.

1352
02:07:23,392 --> 02:07:26,227
Batman's just a symbol, Rachel.

1353
02:07:26,854 --> 02:07:28,514
No. This...

1354
02:07:29,690 --> 02:07:31,398
...is your mask.

1355
02:07:33,360 --> 02:07:36,895
Your real face is the one
that criminals now fear.

1356
02:07:37,739 --> 02:07:39,732
The man I loved...

1357
02:07:40,450 --> 02:07:41,909
...the man who vanished...

1358
02:07:43,119 --> 02:07:45,278
...he never came back at all.

1359
02:07:49,751 --> 02:07:52,420
But maybe he's still
out there somewhere.

1360
02:07:54,589 --> 02:07:58,289
Maybe someday,
when Gotham no longer needs Batman...

1361
02:07:59,344 --> 02:08:01,301
...I'll see him again.

1362
02:08:12,356 --> 02:08:15,274
-Proved me wrong, you know.
-About what?

1363
02:08:18,112 --> 02:08:20,567
Your father would be very proud of you.

1364
02:08:20,781 --> 02:08:22,406
Just like me.

1365
02:08:49,392 --> 02:08:51,266
What will you do?

1366
02:08:52,646 --> 02:08:54,223
Rebuild it.

1367
02:08:55,106 --> 02:08:57,478
Just the way it was, brick for brick.

1368
02:09:04,324 --> 02:09:05,569
Just the way it was, sir?

1369
02:09:07,660 --> 02:09:08,870
Yeah, why?

1370
02:09:08,905 --> 02:09:11,913
I thought this might be
a good opportunity for...

1371
02:09:11,948 --> 02:09:14,502
...improving the foundations.

1372
02:09:14,537 --> 02:09:17,663
-In the southeast corner?
-Precisely, sir.

1373
02:09:33,352 --> 02:09:36,222
-Nice.
-I couldn't find any mob bosses.

1374
02:09:37,189 --> 02:09:39,894
-Well, sergeant?
-It's "lieutenant" now.

1375
02:09:40,234 --> 02:09:42,064
You really started something.

1376
02:09:42,099 --> 02:09:43,895
Bent cops running scared.

1377
02:09:43,930 --> 02:09:45,482
Hope on the streets.

1378
02:09:45,739 --> 02:09:49,357
-But?
-The Narrows is lost.

1379
02:09:49,868 --> 02:09:53,735
And we still haven't picked up Crane or
half the inmates of Arkham that he freed.

1380
02:09:54,414 --> 02:09:56,039
We will.

1381
02:09:56,249 --> 02:09:57,874
We can bring Gotham back.

1382
02:09:57,909 --> 02:10:00,540
-What about escalation?
-Escalation?

1383
02:10:00,575 --> 02:10:05,081
We start carrying semiautomatics,
they buy automatics.

1384
02:10:05,116 --> 02:10:09,587
We start wearing Kevlar,
they buy armor-piercing rounds.

1385
02:10:09,622 --> 02:10:13,048
-And?
-And you're wearing a mask...

1386
02:10:13,474 --> 02:10:15,348
...and jumping off rooftops.

1387
02:10:16,769 --> 02:10:18,809
Now, take this guy.

1388
02:10:19,063 --> 02:10:21,068
Armed robbery, double homicide.

1389
02:10:21,103 --> 02:10:24,524
Got a taste for the theatrical, like you.

1390
02:10:24,777 --> 02:10:26,734
Leaves a calling card.

1391
02:10:32,618 --> 02:10:34,445
I'll look into it.

1392
02:10:37,915 --> 02:10:39,374
I never said thank you.

1393
02:10:44,463 --> 02:10:46,539
And you'll never have to.
