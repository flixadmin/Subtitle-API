1
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,836
-Riders!
-Open the gates!

2
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,448
Why, it's
the Prince of Winterfell.

3
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,286
-Envy isn't attractive.
-Envy.

4
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,205
You should be proud
of your brother's achievement.

5
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:47,375
I took the great castle
of Winterfell with 20 men.

6
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,210
You're a great warrior.

7
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,920
I saw the bodies
above your gates.

8
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,673
Which one gave you
the tougher fight,

9
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:55,216
the cripple or the six-year-old?

10
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:00,013
I treated the Stark boys
with honor,

11
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:01,764
and they repaid me
with treachery.

12
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,141
You treated them with honor?

13
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:06,311
-By butchering them?
-Before I had to kill them,

14
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:08,771
-l treated them...
-You seized their home, as is your right.

15
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,900
-We're ironborn, we take what we need.
-Exactly.

16
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:14,861
And you made them prisoners
in their home, and they ran away.

17
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,404
Is that treachery?

18
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,740
I'd call it bravery.

19
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:20,825
They made me a promise.

20
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,911
Your little boy prisoners
made you a promise,

21
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,704
and you got mad
when they broke it?

22
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:27,248
Are you the dumbest cunt alive?

23
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,791
-Don't call me a--
-A cunt.

24
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:32,170
A dumb cunt who killed
the only two Starks in Winterfell.

25
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,506
You know how valuable
those boys were?

26
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,384
If I hadn't killed them,
the Northerners would think me weak.

27
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:39,427
You are weak.

28
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,388
-And you're stupid.
-I'm warning you.

29
00:03:44,223 --> 00:03:45,141
Go on then.

30
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:46,809
Warn me.

31
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:52,774
You haven't brought enough men.

32
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,693
How am I supposed to defend
Winterfell with just this lot?

33
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:58,196
You're not.
I've come to bring you home.

34
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,865
-Father wants a word.
-Is this a joke?

35
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:04,077
-Winterfell is the heart of the North.
-Aye, it is.

36
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,120
Hundreds of miles from the sea.

37
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:09,457
We're islanders, baby brother.
Had you forgotten that?

38
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,043
Our power comes from our ships.

39
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:16,673
And now that you've decorated your walls
with the bodies of the Stark boys,

40
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:19,384
every man in the North
wants to see you hanged.

41
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:23,429
-When Robb Stark finds out--
-He won't find out.

42
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:26,099
We've killed all the ravens.
We have all the horses.

43
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,769
I've taken Winterfell.

44
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:33,523
And I will keep Winterfell.

45
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:38,194
Leave us.

46
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,293
Theon, you're my blood.

47
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,796
We both loved our mother.

48
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:00,425
We both endured our father.

49
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:06,222
-Come home with me. Don't die here alone.
-I don't intend to die.

50
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:14,188
You were a terrible baby,
do you know that?

51
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:18,276
Bawling all the time,
never sleeping.

52
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,363
And one night,
you just wouldn't shut up.

53
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:24,866
Screaming like a dying pig.

54
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,162
I walked over to your crib.
I looked down at you.

55
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,206
I wanted to strangle you.

56
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,335
And you looked up at me,
and you stopped screaming.

57
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:39,630
You smiled at me.

58
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:46,929
Don't die so far from the sea.

59
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:05,114
I've brought you a present,
Lord of Bones.

60
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:11,370
-Already got one crow. Don't need two.
-Mance will want to question this one.

61
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:14,499
Knows all about where the crows are,
and what they're planning.

62
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:18,211
The Halfhand knows more.
This one is just a little boy.

63
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:19,253
Gut him!

64
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:22,340
He could have killed me
half a dozen times.

65
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:24,926
And now, he wishes he did.
Gut him!

66
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:28,971
He's a bastard of Winterfell,
Ned Stark's son.

67
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:33,810
Mance will want him.

68
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,814
What does Mance want
with a dead man's bastard?

69
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:38,815
Don't know.

70
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,400
I think he'll want to
decide for himself.

71
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:54,747
-He runs... I'll chop his balls off.
-He runs, I'll do it myself.

72
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,799
We're even now, Jon Snow.

73
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,397
I couldn't do it.

74
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:21,607
I had the sword on her neck,

75
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:22,859
-I just couldn't--
-I know.

76
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:25,236
The others?

77
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,822
When you didn't come back,
we went looking for you.

78
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:30,241
We found your
tracks fast enough.

79
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:33,202
But they found us
before we found you.

80
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:36,747
They died because of me.

81
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,625
See that it wasn't for nothing.

82
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:42,837
Oh, yeah, fine.
Come on, on your feet now.

83
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:51,971
Is she beautiful?

84
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:54,599
I've never met her.

85
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:56,893
What's her name?

86
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,521
Frey, I suppose.
I don't know her first name.

87
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:03,774
I'm sure you'll be very happy.

88
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:11,574
-And you're marrying her for a bridge.
-An important bridge.

89
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:15,411
It was before they killed
my father.

90
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:19,373
I still thought I could march south
and rescue him in time,

91
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:20,875
but only if I crossed
that bridge.

92
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,924
When I speak to people from the North...
they all loved your father.

93
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,677
He was the best man I ever met.

94
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:35,264
l know children always think that
about their fathers, but he truly--

95
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:38,851
Children do not always think that
about their fathers. Believe me.

96
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:43,856
He once told me
that being a lord is like being a father.

97
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:48,527
Except you have thousands of children,
and you worry about all of them.

98
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,948
Farmers plowing the fields
are yours to protect.

99
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:55,159
The charwomen scrubbing the floors,
yours to protect.

100
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,578
The soldiers
you order into battle.

101
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,666
He told me he woke with fear
in the morning,

102
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:03,292
and went to bed
with fear in the night.

103
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,004
I didn't believe him.

104
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:13,177
I asked him...
"How can a man be brave if he's afraid?"

105
00:09:14,553 --> 00:09:17,056
"That is the only time
a man can be brave," he told me.

106
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,478
I wish I could have met him.

107
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,606
He would have liked you.

108
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:31,612
Most lords worry more about their gold
and their glory

109
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,406
than the charwomen
scrubbing their floors.

110
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:36,534
-He didn't care much about gold or glory.
-And you?

111
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,996
You think I'm fighting this war
so they'll sing songs about me?

112
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,165
I want to go home.

113
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,962
-I want the men following me to go home.
-Then why don't you?

114
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:50,339
Because we'll never be safe
until the Lannisters are defeated.

115
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,342
And because
I believe in justice.

116
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:57,263
-Chopping off Joffrey's head, you mean.
-That would be a start.

117
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:08,983
Your Grace. My lady.

118
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,403
The Kingslayer,
he escaped in the night.

119
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:14,405
How?

120
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,283
How?

121
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:23,456
Tell me this isn't true.

122
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:29,795
Why?

123
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:34,300
-For the girls.
-You betrayed me.

124
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:35,301
-Robb, I--
-No.

125
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:39,138
You knew I would not allow it,
and you did it anyway.

126
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:43,559
Bran and Rickon are captives
in Winterfell.

127
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:46,812
Sansa and Arya are captives
in King's Landing.

128
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:49,940
I have five children,
and only one of them is free.

129
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:53,277
I lost one son fighting
by your son's side.

130
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:57,031
I lost another to the Kingslayer,
strangled with a chain.

131
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:02,286
You commit treason
because your children are prisoners?

132
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,206
I would carve out my heart

133
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:07,958
and offer it to the Father
if he would let my sons

134
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:11,337
wake from their graves
and step into a prison cell.

135
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,881
-I grieve for your sons, my lord--
-I don't want your grief.

136
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:15,174
I want my vengeance.

137
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,927
And you stole it from me.

138
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,890
Killing Jaime Lannister
would not buy life for your children.

139
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:26,936
But returning him to King's Landing
may buy life for mine.

140
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:31,065
Jaime Lannister
has played you for a fool.

141
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,567
You've weakened our position.

142
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,112
You brought discord
into our camp.

143
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,697
And you did it all
behind my back.

144
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,329
-Make sure she's guarded day and night.
-Robb.

145
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,706
How many men did we send
in pursuit of the Kingslayer?

146
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,209
-Forty, Your Grace.
-Send another 40.

147
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,795
-With our fastest horses.
-Robb.

148
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,356
Damn.

149
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:19,280
You're much uglier in daylight.
What's your name?

150
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:24,827
I'm Jaime Lannister of Casterly Rock,
son of Tywin.

151
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,915
A captive knight has a right
to know his captor's identity.

152
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,293
Brienne of Tarth.

153
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:36,964
Tarth, Tarth, Tarth.
Crescent moons and starbursts.

154
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:41,969
Lord Selwyn Tarth, your father.

155
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,848
Do you have any brothers
and sisters, my lady?

156
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:49,143
It's a long way
to King's Landing.

157
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,812
Might as well
get to know one another.

158
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:56,567
Have you known many men?
I suppose not. Women?

159
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:58,569
Horses?

160
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:02,448
I didn't mean to give offense, my lady.
Forgive me.

161
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:05,242
Your crimes are
past forgiveness, Kingslayer.

162
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:08,245
Why do you hate me so much?
Have I ever harmed you?

163
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:11,749
You've harmed others.
Those you've sworn to protect.

164
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,418
The weak, the innocent--

165
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:17,588
Has anyone ever told you
you're as boring as you are ugly?

166
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:22,384
-You will not provoke me to anger.
-I already have. Look at you.

167
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,303
You're ready to
chop my head off.

168
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:26,514
Do you think you could?

169
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,266
Do you think you could beat me
in a fair fight?

170
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:32,561
-I've never seen you fight.
-The answer is no.

171
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:36,440
There are three men in the kingdoms
who might have a chance against me.

172
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:37,900
You're not one of them.

173
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,819
All my life,
men like you have sneered at me.

174
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:44,490
And all my life, I've been knocking
men like you into the dust.

175
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:47,701
If you're so confident, unlock my chains.
Let's see what happens.

176
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,163
Do you take me for an idiot? In!

177
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:57,086
I took you for a fighter.

178
00:13:57,169 --> 00:14:00,464
A man-- Pardon.
A woman of honor.

179
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:02,716
Was I wrong?

180
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:04,552
You're afraid.

181
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,807
Maybe one day,
we'll find out, Kingslayer.

182
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:27,116
King's Landing will fall an hour
after Stannis lands his force.

183
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:31,704
It's not too late for King Joffrey
and Cersei and the court

184
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:33,038
to ride west to safety.

185
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,250
Surrender the Iron Throne?

186
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:39,003
Better than seeing their heads mounted
on the city gates.

187
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:41,755
Stannis will execute them all.

188
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,383
No, a king who runs
will not be king for long.

189
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,595
He's a Lannister.
He'll stand and fight.

190
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:53,726
Stannis two days from the capital,
and the Wolf at my doorstep.

191
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:56,937
The scouts assure us Robb Stark
remains north of Ashemark.

192
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,816
The last time the scouts assured us
of Stark's movement,

193
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:02,276
he lured us into a trap.

194
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,405
Which is why
my son is his prisoner.

195
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,536
Too close to Casterly Rock.

196
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:17,207
He's sent a splinter force
to recapture Winterfell.

197
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,085
The Greyjoys have
done us a great favor.

198
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:24,548
Stark won't risk marching
on Casterly Rock until he's at full force.

199
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:27,259
He's a boy,
and he's never lost a battle.

200
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:30,929
He'll risk anything
at any time...

201
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,224
because he doesn't know enough
to be afraid.

202
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,692
We'll ride at nightfall.

203
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:47,112
I want a full night's march
before he knows we're on the move.

204
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:50,658
Clegane, you'll maintain
a garrison here at Harrenhal.

205
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:53,952
Track down this Brotherhood
and destroy them.

206
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,916
The girl's proven herself
a good servant.

207
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,126
She'll stay on with you.

208
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,505
See that he doesn't get drunk
in the evenings.

209
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:08,926
He's poor company when he's sober,
but he's better at his work.

210
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:18,519
You've got some questions
to answer!

211
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:22,106
-Who killed Ser Amory?
-I don't know.

212
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:23,440
-Give me the name!
-Please.

213
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:27,778
-Take this one out for the crows.
-l told you... l don't know.

214
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:29,697
Please.

215
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:35,411
Look it. Yoren's little cunt.
Used to be a boy. Now, it's a girl.

216
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,956
-Where's Jaqen?
-Don't care.

217
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:44,378
Where's your stick now, bitch?
I promised to fuck you with it.

218
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:47,047
Come on!
Time to kill some wolves.

219
00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:00,769
You need sour cherries to make it right.
And the secret is, you dry the stones,

220
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,647
then you break them with a mallet.
That's where the real flavor is.

221
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:06,567
You crush them up real fine.
And then when you're finished,

222
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,777
-you sprinkle them over the piecrust.
-Where's Jaqen?

223
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,571
-How would I know?
-I need him now.

224
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:13,866
-Lord Tywin's marching tonight.
-You need him?

225
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:16,744
-He's helping me.
-I saw him.

226
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:18,704
Where?

227
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:23,083
-Where? Where?
-Ow!

228
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,043
They were riding out the gates
a few hours ago.

229
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,963
On patrol. Let go of my ears.

230
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,012
What do you want
with him anyway?

231
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:53,030
Mance is going to
march on the Wall.

232
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:57,743
When he does, one brother inside his army
will be worth 1,000 fighting against it.

233
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:59,745
-They'll never trust me.
-They might.

234
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:01,705
-lf you do what needs to be done.
-What?

235
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,458
How does it feel
knowing those men all died

236
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:07,628
so you could skip through the snow
with your little savage girl?

237
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:09,379
-l didn't.
-l should have known better,

238
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,381
trusting a traitor's bastard.

239
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:18,305
He's not yours to kill, Crow.

240
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:42,579
Do you have to do that here?

241
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:46,208
I like to keep me hands clean.

242
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,837
Yes, but do you
have to do it here?

243
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:02,599
-You should start wearing the gold cloak.
-I don't want to wear a gold cloak.

244
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,309
You're commander
of the City Watch.

245
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:07,771
-You shouldn't be dressed like a common--
-A cloak slows you down in a fight.

246
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:10,023
Makes it hard to move quietly.

247
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,986
And the gold catches the light,
so you're nice and easy to spot at night.

248
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:16,738
Well, you're not sneaking through
alleyways any longer.

249
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,867
-You're supposed to stand out.
-We had a deal.

250
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,160
And wearing a gold cloak
wasn't part of it.

251
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,620
Fine. Fine.

252
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:27,082
No gold cloak.

253
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,049
What?

254
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,386
-What?
-What? What? Why are you staring at me?

255
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:43,932
You don't want me cleaning my nails.
You don't want me looking your way.

256
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:45,559
Why am I here?

257
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,937
To help me plan
the defense of King's Landing.

258
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,148
Stannis will be here any day.

259
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,029
And one of these explains
how to beat him?

260
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:04,077
"An History of the Great Sieges
of Westerosby Archmaester Ch'Vyalthan."

261
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:07,789
-Chevalteesh.
-Sheνelatesh.

262
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,879
I'd swap all your books
for a few good archers.

263
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,214
My Lord Hand. Commander.

264
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:21,303
I must compliment you on the gold cloak's
performance these last few weeks.

265
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:24,932
Did you know there has been
a marked drop in thievery?

266
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,060
I did not know.

267
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:32,272
And how did you accomplish
this marked drop in thievery?

268
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,900
Me and the lads rounded up
all the known thieves.

269
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:38,695
-For questioning?
-No.

270
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,741
It's just the unknown thieves
we need to worry about now.

271
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,868
-We talked about this.
-Aye, we talked about it.

272
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,621
Have you ever been
in a city under siege?

273
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,624
Maybe this part's
not in your books.

274
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,336
See, it's not the fighting
that kills most people. It's the starving.

275
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:56,546
Food's worth more than gold.

276
00:20:57,255 --> 00:21:00,050
Noble ladies sell their diamonds
for a sack of potatoes.

277
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:04,262
Things get bad enough,
the poor start eating each other.

278
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,057
The thieves, they love a siege.

279
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:10,185
Soon as the gates are sealed,
they steal all the food.

280
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:13,522
By the time it's all over,
they're the richest men in town.

281
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:19,653
Given the circumstances, my lord,
I believe extreme measures are warranted.

282
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:26,702
"The Great Sieges of Westeros."
Thrilling subject.

283
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:31,581
Shame Archmaester Ch'vyalthan
wasn't a better writer.

284
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,088
Stannis knows King's Landing.

285
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:45,053
He knows where the walls are strongest.
And he knows which gates are weakest.

286
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,349
The Mud Gate.

287
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:53,020
A good ram
would batter it down in minutes.

288
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:56,898
And it's only 50 yards from the water.
That's where he'll land.

289
00:21:57,441 --> 00:22:01,653
And if Stannis does attack
the Mud Gate, what is our plan?

290
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:06,241
-We could throw books at his men.
-We don't have that many books.

291
00:22:06,324 --> 00:22:07,701
We don't have
that many men either.

292
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:10,370
What do we have?

293
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:13,582
Pig shit.

294
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,352
I'm not cut out
for this sort of work.

295
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,522
I always imagined meself doing
something much worse.

296
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,776
We're digging latrine pits
at the end of the world.

297
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:43,278
I can't imagine
anything much worse.

298
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:45,906
You lack imagination.

299
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,368
Where do you think
Jon is right now?

300
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:53,455
He went off with the Halfhand,
and he didn't come back.

301
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,540
A betting man
would go with dead.

302
00:22:57,042 --> 00:23:02,589
-He's not dead. No, Jon's a great fighter.
-Well, he's better than me.

303
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:07,219
-And a lot better than you.
-He's got his Valyrian steel sword.

304
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:09,638
So did his father.

305
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,516
And Qhorin Halfhand's
the greatest ranger alive.

306
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:14,768
Great rangers never get old
is the problem.

307
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:16,603
Shit ones neither.

308
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:20,315
Some in the middle
last a long time.

309
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,031
What in seven hells is that?

310
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:45,882
The First Men made these marks.

311
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:47,717
Help me with it.

312
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:02,941
Look!

313
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:09,489
If you find something
you're not supposed to,

314
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,993
best thing to do is pretend
you've never seen it.

315
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:14,369
That's a Night's Watch cloak.

316
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:16,454
It's been here a long time.

317
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:26,173
-It must be dragonglass.
-Dragonglass?

318
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,675
The maesters call it obsidian.

319
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:32,846
Why would a brother
hide it here?

320
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:36,183
I expect it's cause he wanted
somebody to find it.

321
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:43,815
Mind where you're going.

322
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:54,409
I'm sorry. I'll...

323
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:59,039
-Where were you?
-A man has patrol duty.

324
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:01,791
Tywin Lannister was right here.
And now, he's gone.

325
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,543
A girl owes one more name.

326
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,921
The Red God demands it.
Give the man a name.

327
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:10,884
How long after I give you the name
does it take you to kill someone?

328
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:14,596
A minute, an hour, a month.

329
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:17,307
Death is certain.

330
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:19,976
The time is not.

331
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:22,187
He's taking his army
to attack my brother.

332
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,272
I need him dead right now.

333
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:26,900
This a man cannot do.

334
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,903
You promised you'd help me.

335
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,365
Help was not promised,
lovely girl. Only death.

336
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:36,785
There must be others.
Give a name, any name.

337
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:38,536
And you'll kill them?

338
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,206
Anybody?

339
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:48,380
By the Seven New Gods and the Old Gods
beyond counting, I swear it.

340
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,260
All right.

341
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:00,392
Jaqen H'ghar.

342
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:10,527
-A girl gives a man his own name?
-That's right.

343
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:13,571
Gods are not mocked.
This is no joking thing.

344
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:16,283
I'm not joking.
A man can go kill himself.

345
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:17,325
Unname me.

346
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:19,035
-No.
-Please.

347
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:23,206
I'll unname you...

348
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:27,043
-Thank you.
-...if you help me and my friends escape.

349
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:31,923
This would require more than one life.
This is not part of our bargain.

350
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:33,758
Fine. Jaqen H'ghar.

351
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:35,885
A girl lacks honor.

352
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:48,231
-If I do this thing, a girl must obey.
-A girl will obey.

353
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:53,570
A girl and her friends will walk
through the gate at midnight.

354
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,368
Thank you, Podrick.

355
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:08,668
Odd little boy.

356
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:11,880
I have a certain sympathy
for odd little boys.

357
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:13,631
You and Varys both.

358
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:17,635
Excellent lamprey pie.

359
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:20,513
Were you slaving away
in the kitchen all day?

360
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,975
I hear Joffrey
plans on fighting.

361
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:28,104
An inspiration for the troops.
The young king in his shining armor,

362
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:30,690
fighting to defend the capital
against the wicked old rebel.

363
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:31,816
He's only a boy.

364
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:34,527
Younger boys
are off fighting his war.

365
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:38,573
-He's not ready.
-What is he, 17?

366
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:41,743
-Remember Jamie at 17?
-Better than you.

367
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:44,662
Some men have a gift
for this sort of thing.

368
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:46,247
Some don't.

369
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,917
His place is not
on the battlefield.

370
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,545
It's not on the throne either,
sadly for all of us.

371
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:58,218
Do you think I'm an idiot?

372
00:27:58,301 --> 00:28:00,512
No. I'd say you possess
above-average intelligence.

373
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:02,222
You shipped off
my only daughter.

374
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:06,142
And now, you want to send my eldest son
to the battlefield to die.

375
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:07,811
He'll have his Kingsguard
protecting him.

376
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:10,605
He has the finest armor
gold can buy.

377
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,108
He needs to be out there.

378
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:16,486
The men will fight more fiercely
seeing their king fighting beside them.

379
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:19,114
Instead of hiding behind
his mother's skirts.

380
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:21,574
Any dessert?

381
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:24,744
Do you know why
Varys is so dangerous?

382
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,956
Because he has thousands of spies
in his employ.

383
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:31,793
Because he knows everything
we do before we do it.

384
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,169
Because he doesn't have a cock.

385
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,255
Neither do you.

386
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,800
Perhaps I'm dangerous too.

387
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:43,388
You on the other hand,
are as big a fool as every other man.

388
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:47,725
That little worm between your legs
does half your thinking.

389
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:48,852
It's not that little.

390
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:57,610
Why are you smiling?

391
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,905
-Because I'm happy.
-And why are you happy?

392
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:07,704
Because I have
your little whore.

393
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:14,752
-I thought you preferred blondes.
-You're such a droll little fellow.

394
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:17,297
Tell me,
have you married this one yet?

395
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,132
No?

396
00:29:19,757 --> 00:29:23,595
-Good. Father will be so pleased.
-Why do you care who I fuck?

397
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:26,222
'Cause a Lannister
always pays her debts.

398
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:30,393
You stole my only daughter.
You plot to have Joffrey killed.

399
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:33,229
This is madness.
Stannis will be here in days.

400
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:35,815
-You need me.
-For what? Your skill in battle?

401
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:40,278
Pretty thing, your whore.

402
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:42,614
Lovely body.

403
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:45,283
The bruises will heal in time.

404
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:48,661
Where did you find her?

405
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:51,206
Varys isn't the only one
who hears whispers.

406
00:29:51,789 --> 00:29:53,875
Really?
A Lannister lion necklace.

407
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:57,629
You need to hide your
secret whores more carefully.

408
00:29:58,004 --> 00:30:00,548
You've forgotten the most
important thing about whores.

409
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,928
Well, you're the expert.
Tell me.

410
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:07,722
You don't buy them.

411
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:09,682
You only rent them.

412
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:13,311
You're usually a better liar,
baby brother.

413
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,147
This one, you like.

414
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:18,942
You like her very much.

415
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,819
Could it be love?

416
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,281
Don't worry,
she'll be treated gently enough.

417
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,492
Unless Joffrey is hurt,

418
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:30,036
and then every wound he suffers,
she'll suffer too.

419
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:32,497
And if he dies...

420
00:30:33,831 --> 00:30:36,834
there isn't a man alive who could devise
a more painful death

421
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,211
for your little cunt.

422
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:44,717
And how do I know
you haven't killed her already?

423
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,595
You like to see her?
I thought you might.

424
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:50,348
Ser Mandon,
bring in my brother's whore.

425
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:24,716
I'm sorry they hurt you.

426
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:28,136
You must be brave.

427
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:36,603
I promise, I will free you.

428
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:39,606
Don't forget me.

429
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:41,482
Never.

430
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:01,669
I will hurt you for this.

431
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:06,174
A day will come when you think
you're safe and happy,

432
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,802
and your joy will turn to ashes
in your mouth.

433
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:15,767
-And you'll know the debt is paid.
-Get out.

434
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:28,821
Shae!

435
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,785
I've been waiting all night.

436
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:35,787
What is wrong?

437
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:38,373
You're beautiful.

438
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:47,840
Then why do you look sad?

439
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:56,766
We have to be more careful.

440
00:32:57,183 --> 00:33:00,144
Don't be afraid.
I can take care of myself.

441
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,814
There are people
who want to hurt me.

442
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:08,403
I know. I won't let them.
I'll cut off their faces. I will.

443
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:15,493
I would kill for you.
Do you know that?

444
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:19,997
I... I expect I'll have to
before this is over.

445
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:24,335
You're mine.

446
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:27,296
I'm yours.

447
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,174
Promise me!

448
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:36,514
I'm yours. And you are mine.

449
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,278
Still no word.

450
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:54,282
We've sent a dozen ravens.
None have returned.

451
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:59,203
My bastard is only a few days
from Winterfell.

452
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,372
-Once he captures the castle--
-Theon has my brothers.

453
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:04,500
-lf we storm the castle--
-He wouldn't dare hurt the boys.

454
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:09,213
They're his only hope
of escaping the North with his head.

455
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:13,009
Send word to your son.

456
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:18,765
Any ironborn who surrender will be allowed
to return safely to their homes.

457
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:23,186
A touch of mercy is a virtue,
Your Grace. Too much--

458
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:26,606
Any ironborn with the exception
of Theon Greyjoy.

459
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,442
He betrayed our cause.

460
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:31,527
He betrayed me.

461
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:35,323
And we will hunt him down
no matter where he runs.

462
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:39,035
I expect his countrymen will turn on him
the minute they hear the offer.

463
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:45,625
-Your pardon, my lord. Your Grace.
-My lady.

464
00:34:58,471 --> 00:34:59,388
How are you?

465
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:02,517
How am I?

466
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:04,644
I've had to arrest my mother.

467
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:07,188
The Lannisters have my sisters.

468
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:12,360
The man I considered my closest friend
has seized my home and my brothers.

469
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:15,571
I'm fighting a war, and I don't know
if I should march south or north.

470
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:18,699
I'm sorry. It was a stupid question.
I'm sorry.

471
00:35:19,116 --> 00:35:21,244
No... forgive me.

472
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:23,871
You're being kind.

473
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:25,998
-I have no right--
-You have every right.

474
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:27,917
You're a king.

475
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,211
That's not the kind of king I want to be.

476
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:35,132
-What kind do you want to be?
-I don't know. The good kind?

477
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:41,430
Most kings grew up as princes,

478
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:44,058
they spend their whole lives
preparing for the crown.

479
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:46,310
I was raised to be Lord of Winterfell.

480
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,566
I was raised to be a proper little lady.

481
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:55,069
To play the harp,
and dance the latest steps,

482
00:35:55,152 --> 00:35:56,779
and recite Valyrian poetry.

483
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:00,616
-I'd like to hear you play the harp.
-No. No, you would not.

484
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,375
How did you go
from reciting Valyrian poetry

485
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,460
to sawing off men's feet?

486
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:26,142
When I was 12,
my mother and father went to a wedding.

487
00:36:27,184 --> 00:36:29,353
Weddings in Volantis
last for days, you know?

488
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:32,273
And they left me with my little brother.

489
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:37,111
The second afternoon they were gone
was the hottest day

490
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:38,529
in the three-year summer.

491
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:42,199
We couldn't bear to be inside,
so we ran down to the Rhoyne.

492
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,828
Every child in Volantis
was in the Rhoyne that day.

493
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:51,375
The rich, the poor,
we were all there naked, screaming,

494
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:53,002
racing to the little islands.

495
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:55,671
Drummers were playing
for coppers in the east bank.

496
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,094
I was treading water...

497
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:07,308
talking to a friend...
when I realized I hadn't seen my brother.

498
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,645
I called his name.

499
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:14,315
And then I started screaming his name.

500
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:18,110
And then I saw him...

501
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:20,821
floating facedown.

502
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:24,241
And my heart just...

503
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:26,702
stopped. I was...

504
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:33,376
I dragged him from the water.

505
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:38,130
My friend helped me, I think.
I don't even remember.

506
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:42,677
He was so little.

507
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,514
And we pulled him onto the riverbank.

508
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:52,436
And I screamed at him. And I shook him.

509
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:54,981
And he was dead.

510
00:37:57,566 --> 00:37:58,567
Just dead.

511
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:04,073
A man ran over.

512
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:09,203
He had a fish tattoo on his face.

513
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:15,209
In Volantis, the slaves have tattoos,
so you know what they are

514
00:38:15,292 --> 00:38:16,502
without having to talk to them.

515
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:19,213
And this man worked on a fishing boat.

516
00:38:20,297 --> 00:38:21,924
And he pushed me out of the way.

517
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:27,930
You have to understand,
for a slave to push a Highborn girl,

518
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:31,225
that's death for the man.
A terrible death.

519
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,687
But he pushed me out of the way.

520
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:39,984
And he started pressing
on my brother's chest.

521
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:45,865
Again, and again, and again
until my brother...

522
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:49,577
spat out half of the Rhoyne...

523
00:38:51,328 --> 00:38:54,874
and cried out. And the man
cradled his head, and told him to be calm.

524
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,216
I decided two things that day.

525
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:08,387
I would not waste my years planning
dances and masquerades

526
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:09,805
with the other noble ladies.

527
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:13,684
And... when I came of age...

528
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,480
I would never live in a slave city again.

529
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:28,365
I'm sorry, Your Grace.
You told me of your problems,

530
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:31,994
-and I blathered on--
-I don't want to marry the Frey girl.

531
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:38,334
I don't want you to marry her.

532
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:43,380
But you needed that bridge.

533
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:48,761
I hope it's a very beautiful bridge.

534
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:57,454
The sour cherries
was all crushed up and ready.

535
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:58,581
Shut up.

536
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:01,500
They're probably
in the pie crust by now. In the oven.

537
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:06,172
-The nice, warm oven.
-Shut up. What did you bring?

538
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:07,965
The cheese could be better.

539
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:10,634
l did get some nice sausages.

540
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:12,595
What did he want us
to do about those guards?

541
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:16,307
He didn't say. He just said,
"Walk through the gates."

542
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:19,768
-Yeah, what about the guards?
-He didn't say anything about the guards.

543
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:20,936
He left that bit out?

544
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:23,647
That's a pretty important part,
don't you think?

545
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:26,025
-We have to trust him.
-Trust him?

546
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:29,570
You trusted him to fight with us,
and you set him free, and he ran!

547
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:33,282
-l want to go back to the kitchens.
-Shut up. Stay here if you're afraid.

548
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:37,870
Arya, don't!

549
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:09,193
Away! Reset!

550
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,282
Hold it. Go!

551
00:42:16,533 --> 00:42:17,993
On the tide, pull!

552
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:21,121
If the wind holds,
we'll reach King's Landing in a day.

553
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,164
Will it hold?

554
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:24,959
Can't make promises for the wind,
Your Grace.

555
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:29,296
-Again! Pull!
-Can you turn up the ramp?

556
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:33,467
I admire you, Ser Davos.

557
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:35,636
I thank you, Your Grace.

558
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:37,096
-Away!
-Pleased to hear it.

559
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:40,975
Some Highborn fools call you Onion Knight,
and think they insult you.

560
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:46,146
So, you take the onion for your sigil,
sew it on your coat, fly the onion flag.

561
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:48,315
My son wishes me to change it.

562
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:51,026
Three mermen with tridents,
something like that.

563
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:54,822
l understand why the older families
look down at me.

564
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:56,865
Do you?

565
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:59,201
-Why?
-My father was a crabber.

566
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:01,036
And?

567
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:04,498
Well, sons of lords don't like to break
bread with sons of crabbers.

568
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,083
Our hands stink.

569
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:09,128
And where were those lords
when Storm's End starved?

570
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:13,048
But many fought bravely for your brother.
Many fought for the Mad King.

571
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:17,303
You defend these men
who insult you behind your back.

572
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:21,515
-But some are happy to do it in my face.
-We were forgotten.

573
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:25,269
Robert and Ned Stark,
they were the heroes.

574
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:28,772
The glorious rebels,
marching from battle to battle.

575
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:31,734
Liberating towns
from the yoke of the Mad King,

576
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:34,111
while l held Storm's End with 500 men.

577
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:36,614
-No one has forgotten, Your Grace.
-No? Robert did.

578
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:38,449
He gave Storm's End to Renly
after the war.

579
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:39,992
Renly never fought a day in his life.

580
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:42,286
-He was only a boy.
-Then why'd he give him Storm's End?

581
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:48,125
First, we ate the horses.

582
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:51,920
We weren't riding anywhere.
Not with the castle surrounded.

583
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:54,631
We couldn't feed them.
So, fine, the horses.

584
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:59,136
Then the cats. Never liked cats.
So, fine. I do like dogs.

585
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:03,057
Good animals, loyal,
but we ate them. Then the rats.

586
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:07,644
The night before you slipped through,
I thought my wife was dying.

587
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:09,730
She couldn't speak anymore,
she was so frail.

588
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:12,775
And then you made it through the lines.

589
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:16,403
Slipped right through in your little
black sailboat with your onions.

590
00:44:16,945 --> 00:44:19,740
And potatoes. Some salted beef, I believe.

591
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:22,034
Every man on Storm's End
wanted to kiss you that night.

592
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:24,036
I was relieved they did not.

593
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:29,291
Robert told me to hold Storm's End,
so I held it.

594
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:34,546
Then he told me he was giving it
to Renly, so I gave it up.

595
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:36,632
Insult or no, I gave it up.

596
00:44:36,715 --> 00:44:39,301
Because Robert was my older brother,
and he was the king,

597
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:40,761
and I've always done my duty.

598
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:44,431
But now, I'm the rightful king
by every law of Westeros.

599
00:44:45,682 --> 00:44:48,060
And when I sit the Iron Throne,
you'll be my Hand.

600
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:52,147
Your Grace...

601
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:56,276
I pray I serve you well.

602
00:44:58,237 --> 00:45:00,656
I expect you'll be the first
crabber's son to wear the badge.

603
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:05,869
Pardon me, please.

604
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:09,289
You're the Master of Whisperers.
You're supposed to know everything.

605
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:12,334
No man can be in all rooms
at all times.

606
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:15,212
I have many little birds
in the north, my lord.

607
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:19,716
But l haven’t heard their songs
since Theon Greyjoy captured Winterfell.

608
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:23,095
The Stark forces are distracted.
Now is the time to strike.

609
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:24,596
To strike?

610
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:28,559
My dear nephew, you do see these men
preparing the walls for siege?

611
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:32,062
You do understand
Stannis Baratheon sails this way?

612
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:34,982
If my Uncle Stannis
lands on the shores of King's Landing,

613
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:38,318
-I'll ride out to greet him.
-A brave choice, Your Grace.

614
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:41,071
I'm sure your men will line up behind you.

615
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:43,574
They say Stannis never smiles.

616
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:46,702
I'll give him a red smile.

617
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:48,787
From ear to ear.

618
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:56,086
Imagine Stannis's terror.

619
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:58,213
I am trying.

620
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:03,677
You're an intelligent man.
I'd like to think I'm an intelligent man.

621
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:07,389
No one disputes that, my lord.
Not even the multitudes who despise you.

622
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:10,517
I wish we could converse
as two honest, intelligent men.

623
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:11,894
I wish we could, too.

624
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:16,023
What do you want?

625
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:17,774
Tell me.

626
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:22,237
If we're going to play,
you'll have to start.

627
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:30,412
My brother was the youngest
Kingsguard in history.

628
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:34,666
My sister became queen at the age of 19.

629
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:38,253
When I reached manhood,

630
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:42,132
my father put me in charge of all
the drains and cisterns in Casterly Rock.

631
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:46,053
-A most highborn plumber.
-The water never flowed better.

632
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:48,972
And all the shit found its way to the sea.

633
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:52,059
I never expected to have any real power.

634
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:54,770
So, when my father named me acting Hand--

635
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:59,149
You're quite good at being Hand, you know?
Jon Arryn and Ned Stark were good men.

636
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:00,943
Honorable men.

637
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:04,613
But they disdained the game
and those who played.

638
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:07,115
-You enjoy the game.
-I do.

639
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:09,451
Last thing I expected.

640
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:12,621
-And you play it well.
-I'd like to keep playing it.

641
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:18,627
If Stannis breaches the gates,
the game is over.

642
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:23,090
They say he burns his enemies alive
to honor the Lord of Light.

643
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:26,009
The Lord of Light
wants his enemies burned.

644
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:28,011
The Drowned God wants them drowned.

645
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:31,056
Why are all the gods such vicious cunts?

646
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:33,850
Where's the god of tits and wine?

647
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:39,022
In the Summer lsles, they worship
the fertility goddess with 16 teats.

648
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:41,149
We should sail there immediately.

649
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:46,405
This morning, I heard a song.

650
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:50,075
All the way from Qarth,
beyond the Red Waste.

651
00:47:50,867 --> 00:47:52,828
Daenerys Targaryen lives.

652
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:56,832
A girl at the edge of the world
is the least of our problems.

653
00:47:57,332 --> 00:47:58,875
She has three dragons.

654
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:04,089
But even if what they say is true,
it'll be years

655
00:48:04,172 --> 00:48:05,549
before they are fully grown.

656
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:08,552
And then there'll be nowhere to hide.

657
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:12,264
One game at a time, my friend.

658
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:14,641
Race to the gold!

659
00:48:22,941 --> 00:48:24,192
Careful, Khaleesi.

660
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:28,572
Xaro owns this city, and the warlocks
have 1,000 eyes watching for you.

661
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:31,783
I've found one.

662
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:34,620
A ship with a good captain.

663
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:38,123
-She leaves for Astapor tomorrow.
-Astapor?

664
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:41,335
-We cannot stay here.
-They have my dragons.

665
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:43,295
A mother does not flee
without her children.

666
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:44,963
They're not your children.

667
00:48:46,131 --> 00:48:48,175
I know they call you,
the Mother of Dragons,

668
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:50,927
and I know you love them,
but you didn't grow them in your womb.

669
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:53,221
They didn't suckle at your breast.
They are dragons, Khaleesi.

670
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:55,724
And if we stay in Qarth, we'll die.

671
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:58,310
You should sail to Astapor.
I'm sure you'll be safe there.

672
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:03,523
You know I would die for you.

673
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:06,360
I will never abandon you.

674
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:10,739
-I'm sworn to protect you. To serve.
-Then serve me.

675
00:49:11,573 --> 00:49:14,117
If my dragons
are in the House of the Undying,

676
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:15,243
then take me there.

677
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:18,830
That's what the warlock wants.
He told you so himself.

678
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:21,041
If you enter that place,
you will never leave again.

679
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:24,127
-His magic is strong.
-And what of my magic?

680
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:27,881
You saw me step in to the fire.
You watched the witch burn.

681
00:49:27,964 --> 00:49:30,050
What did the flames do to me?
Do you remember?

682
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:35,722
Until my last breath, I will remember.

683
00:49:38,016 --> 00:49:40,644
After I have forgotten my mother's face.

684
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:46,775
They are my children.

685
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:51,571
And they are the only children
I will ever have.

686
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,079
Take me to them.

687
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:13,093
We should bury them.

688
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:17,597
I'd leave them up a few more days.
Sends a message.

689
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:21,518
If they haven’t got the damn message yet,
a few more days won't help.

690
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:23,270
As you say.

691
00:50:23,937 --> 00:50:26,148
But it don't hurt
to let them rot a while longer.

692
00:50:27,899 --> 00:50:30,944
-What's this?
-Gold... for the farmer,

693
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:33,280
for his... trouble.

694
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:35,741
His troubles are done.

695
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:37,826
He's feeding the crops now.

696
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:39,828
His wife, too.

697
00:50:42,622 --> 00:50:44,708
You want to keep a man silent,
you silence him.

698
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:07,981
Got as far as the farm. Then doubled back.

699
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:12,819
Walked through the stream
to throw off the hounds.

700
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:18,158
I hope this would be the last place
they'd think to look.

701
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:22,120
You're right.

702
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:23,872
So far.

703
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:29,169
Who was that out there?
Hung up at the gates?

704
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:32,798
Must have been the farmer's boys.

705
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:36,593
He killed them. Burned them.

706
00:51:38,678 --> 00:51:40,597
And passed them off as the little lords?

707
00:51:42,724 --> 00:51:43,892
They mustn't know.

708
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:47,604
Bran would blame himself.

709
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:50,023
They'll never hear it from me.

710
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:53,693
The little lads have suffered enough.
