1
00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:02,588
Previously on Gotham...

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:03,978
Who are those people
you were speaking with?

3
00:00:04,026 --> 00:00:05,319
You keep your nose out of my business.

4
00:00:05,367 --> 00:00:06,733
Now, now, Butch, play nice.

5
00:00:06,769 --> 00:00:08,355
If a person comes into
contact with my blood,

6
00:00:08,387 --> 00:00:09,620
it changes them.

7
00:00:09,655 --> 00:00:11,055
My brother... he gets

8
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:12,089
in your mind, you're doomed.

9
00:00:12,125 --> 00:00:14,091
Good-bye, Mr. Gordon.

10
00:00:15,088 --> 00:00:17,085
- Ivy's missing.
- She'll turn up somewhere.

11
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:18,283
This time she fell.

12
00:00:18,319 --> 00:00:20,352
It was a long way down into water.

13
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:21,787
Maybe she survived.

14
00:00:21,822 --> 00:00:23,322
- What's your name?
- My name's Ivy.

15
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:24,756
Barnes asked me to put you on

16
00:00:24,792 --> 00:00:26,959
a 48-hour suicide watch. I've
already signed off on it.

17
00:00:26,994 --> 00:00:28,994
- He just cost you the election!
- Give me one reason

18
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,296
why I shouldn't let Butch
kill you where you stand.

19
00:00:31,332 --> 00:00:32,364
- Oswald Cobblepot
- There's that.

20
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,799
Has won the mayor's office.

21
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:35,534
I believe in you, Oswald.

22
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:37,202
You never believed

23
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:38,504
I could win this election on my own.

24
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:39,793
Maybe you're not cut
out for this, after all.

25
00:00:39,818 --> 00:00:40,840
What?!

26
00:00:40,904 --> 00:00:42,941
- Jervis. Let her go now.
- No!

27
00:00:42,977 --> 00:00:43,942
I'll never go with you!

28
00:00:43,978 --> 00:00:46,378
No!

29
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:50,481
You killed her!

30
00:00:58,839 --> 00:01:00,359
I would like to introduce you

31
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:02,027
to my chief of staff,

32
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,029
Mr. Edward Nygma.

33
00:01:08,936 --> 00:01:11,236
Welcome your new mayor of Gotham.

34
00:01:11,272 --> 00:01:13,572
Mayor Oswald Cobblepot.

35
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:15,340
He'll make Gotham safe again.

36
00:01:15,376 --> 00:01:18,243
Welcome your new mayor of Gotham.

37
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:21,046
Mayor Oswald Cobblepot.

38
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,514
He'll make Gotham safe again.

39
00:01:24,723 --> 00:01:27,119
Welcome your new mayor of Gotham.

40
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:29,521
Mayor Oswald Cobblepot.

41
00:01:43,697 --> 00:01:45,307
Thank you so much, thank you.

42
00:02:05,426 --> 00:02:07,893
There's something I've
been wanting to ask you.

43
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:10,929
Am I a good boy?

44
00:02:10,965 --> 00:02:12,864
Have I made you proud?

45
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,671
I hope I'm not interrupting.

46
00:02:19,707 --> 00:02:23,475
Oh, Ed, you never met my mother.

47
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:25,577
Wasn't she beautiful?

48
00:02:28,048 --> 00:02:29,826
A fine figure of a woman.

49
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:33,719
She was my whole world.

50
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:37,189
The only one that was
always there for me.

51
00:02:37,224 --> 00:02:39,958
Well, I believe the answer is yes.

52
00:02:41,929 --> 00:02:43,557
She would be proud.

53
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,797
Do you really think so?

54
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:48,567
Oswald, look at everything
you've achieved.

55
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:50,802
The people love you.

56
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:52,571
Gangs fear you.

57
00:02:52,606 --> 00:02:55,040
And tomorrow night, the crÃ¨me of Gotham

58
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:58,410
will be gathering to celebrate you.

59
00:03:00,447 --> 00:03:02,748
What more could someone ask for?

60
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,423
Someone to share it with.

61
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,765
My mother was the
daughter of immigrants.

62
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,233
A humble cook.

63
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:22,668
We did not have much,

64
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:25,637
but when she was by
my side, I felt loved.

65
00:03:25,673 --> 00:03:27,305
Protected.

66
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:30,642
As promised, I have rid Gotham
of its villainous monsters.

67
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:34,079
With my mother as my witness,

68
00:03:34,114 --> 00:03:36,548
I vow to you from this day forward,

69
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,083
every man, woman,

70
00:03:38,118 --> 00:03:40,419
and child in our great city

71
00:03:40,454 --> 00:03:42,287
will be safe!

72
00:03:50,064 --> 00:03:52,330
No one is safe. Not from us.

73
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:54,199
Drop it.

74
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,300
Put it down.

75
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:17,622
You will pay for this!

76
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:18,890
Dearly!

77
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:20,792
Now, now, Mr. Mayor.

78
00:04:20,828 --> 00:04:22,294
Don't go losing your head.

79
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:24,830
Have a nice day.

80
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:35,054

81
00:04:37,244 --> 00:04:39,377
I can't come over tonight.

82
00:04:39,413 --> 00:04:41,146
Okay.

83
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:43,415
I mean, that'd be three nights in a row.

84
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,416
That'd almost make it a thing.

85
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:46,585
The neighbors might talk.

86
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,165
Exactly. And I have a dinner.

87
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,523
It's not a date.

88
00:04:51,558 --> 00:04:54,159
None of my business.

89
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:56,695
Uh-huh.

90
00:04:56,730 --> 00:05:01,366
So... whatever happened with Tetch?

91
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:03,034
I told you.

92
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,370
He broke his sister out of the GCPD.

93
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:06,538
Bullock and I chased him down.

94
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:08,073
She died. He escaped.

95
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:09,341
'Cause I heard a rumor

96
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:11,512
there's something
strange about her blood.

97
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,016
Do you like this?

98
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:19,818
I think I made that pretty clear.

99
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:20,719
Then why are you pressing?

100
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:22,020
Because I want to know.

101
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:23,989
Are you asking as a
reporter or as yourself?

102
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:25,023
Is there a difference?

103
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:26,925
There should be. When you were a cop,

104
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,110
did you stop being one
when you came home?

105
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,832
Maybe that was my problem.

106
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:36,434
Hmm.

107
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,503
The guy I'm having dinner
with is the hematologist

108
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:41,740
in charge of analyzing
Alice Tetch's blood.

109
00:05:41,775 --> 00:05:44,843
I'm free after 10:00
if you want to call.

110
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:47,479
Thanks for the coffee.

111
00:05:58,425 --> 00:05:59,758
We found the truck.

112
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,462
They ditched it in the Narrows.

113
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:05,864
We got forensics going over it

114
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:08,366
and teams doing a ten-block sweep.

115
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:10,302
We already found this.

116
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:11,536
The Red Hood Gang.

117
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:13,004
I thought those idiots were dead.

118
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,406
My guess is they're copying the look.

119
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:17,175
The original Red Hood
Gang were bank robbers.

120
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:19,277
Whoever they are, they
got a beef with Penguin.

121
00:06:19,313 --> 00:06:21,613
Expand the search to 15 blocks.

122
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:22,848
Everything goes through you.

123
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,049
You mean through me.

124
00:06:28,822 --> 00:06:31,089
Wow.

125
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:38,730
It is good to be back.

126
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:42,067
I have missed all of you.

127
00:06:43,303 --> 00:06:45,170
Harvey.

128
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:47,995
Still a stranger to a
haircut and a shave, I see.

129
00:06:48,059 --> 00:06:49,741
What are you doing here, Nygma?

130
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:51,576
As Mayor Cobblepot's chief of staff,

131
00:06:51,612 --> 00:06:53,345
I'm gonna be your liaison on
the Red Hood investigation.

132
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,647
I want to see all reports.

133
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:57,549
I'm gonna need access
to your forensic lab.

134
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:00,218
You think I'm gonna just let
you waltz into my precinct?

135
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:02,654
You're a cop killer who should be

136
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:03,655
in the loony bin.

137
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,658
- I'll be damned...
- You'll be fired.

138
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:09,194
The mayor can't fire me.

139
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:11,529
No, but he can appoint

140
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:13,298
a police commissioner who will.

141
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,468
So... you will carry out

142
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:18,503
the mayor's orders without question

143
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:20,105
or the GCPD has a new captain.

144
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,239
How does that sound?

145
00:07:23,377 --> 00:07:25,819
Every dog has his day, Nygma.

146
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:28,380
Enjoy yours.

147
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:34,586
And where is our lord mayor?

148
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,388
Hiding under his desk?

149
00:07:37,418 --> 00:07:39,858
He's meeting with constituents.

150
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:46,164
"Anything for you, my
little Cobble Pot."

151
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:49,801
"You can count on me."

152
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:55,040
Those were the words my
mother used to whisper to me

153
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:57,375
every night before I fell asleep.

154
00:07:57,411 --> 00:07:58,944
She was a saint.

155
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,679
Yes.

156
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:02,981
A saint whose only desire was

157
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:05,283
to love me.

158
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:07,352
And what was her thanks?

159
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:10,922
Not only did she take
a knife in the back...

160
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:15,160
but even in her death, her
memory is being desecrated.

161
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:16,195
Seriously?

162
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:18,897
This is the reason we're here?

163
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:20,432
A little glue.

164
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:21,533
Some paint.

165
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:22,634
Mama will be good as new, eh?

166
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:25,570
No!

167
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:28,868
That is not the reason you are here.

168
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:31,943
The Red Hoods have
challenged my authority.

169
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:33,178
They will be made an example of.

170
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:34,913
Tonight,

171
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:36,848
I am celebrating my historic victory...

172
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:38,750
At the Sirens.

173
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:40,552
It's gonna be fabulous.

174
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:42,287
None of you are invited.

175
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:46,358
I want them found and
their leader's head

176
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:49,027
brought to me on a
spike before nightfall.

177
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:52,497
What are you waiting for?!

178
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,199
Find them!

179
00:08:57,137 --> 00:09:00,138
All right, five-card draw, gentlemen.

180
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:02,507
All right, someone didn't ante up.

181
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,976
Come on, you cheap bastards.

182
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:10,048
How long are we supposed to wait?

183
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:12,217
Long as it takes the
boss man to get here.

184
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:13,218
You need a lookout.

185
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:18,056
Uh, relax, fellas.

186
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:20,125
Hey, uh, you want us
to deal you in, boss?

187
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,695
We don't have time for games, boys.

188
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,730
We got work to do.

189
00:09:35,369 --> 00:09:37,069
Hello, Jim.

190
00:09:37,104 --> 00:09:39,205
Is it a bad time? I should've called.

191
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,007
No.

192
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,710
Please, come in.

193
00:09:50,985 --> 00:09:53,085
Can I get you something to drink?

194
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,155
- A... glass of water?
- I'm fine.

195
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:57,456
I heard you were back.

196
00:09:57,492 --> 00:09:59,959
I've been meaning to come see you.

197
00:09:59,994 --> 00:10:02,194
- Everything okay?
- Yes.

198
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:03,462
Alfred and I are both well.

199
00:10:05,309 --> 00:10:08,033
I hear you're a private
investigator now.

200
00:10:08,069 --> 00:10:09,502
I'd like to hire you.

201
00:10:09,537 --> 00:10:11,604
Uh, Bruce, if this is about corruption

202
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:13,339
at Wayne Enterprises... It's not.

203
00:10:13,374 --> 00:10:16,668
I've put my investigation into
my father's company aside.

204
00:10:17,044 --> 00:10:18,344
It's time I moved on.

205
00:10:18,379 --> 00:10:19,778
Why the sudden change of heart?

206
00:10:19,814 --> 00:10:21,146
It's far from sudden.

207
00:10:21,182 --> 00:10:23,282
I've given it a great deal of thought.

208
00:10:23,317 --> 00:10:26,085
I can't live my life
if I keep looking back.

209
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,755
For what it's worth,
I think that's wise.

210
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,090
So, what can I do for you?

211
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:33,025
Ivy Pepper's gone missing.

212
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,327
I didn't realize you two were close.

213
00:10:35,363 --> 00:10:37,863
We're not, she's a friend of Selina's.

214
00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:40,268
And does Selina know you're doing this?

215
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,300
No.

216
00:10:41,335 --> 00:10:43,669
I don't want to get her hopes
up if we don't find anything.

217
00:10:46,073 --> 00:10:48,807
Well, we'll start with the GCPD.

218
00:10:48,843 --> 00:10:50,609
See where we go from there.

219
00:10:50,645 --> 00:10:53,979
I think it's chivalrous,
you doing this for Selina.

220
00:10:54,015 --> 00:10:55,414
How long have you two been a thing?

221
00:10:55,449 --> 00:10:57,349
Oh, no, no, no.

222
00:10:57,385 --> 00:10:59,818
- Selina's a friend, that's all.
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

223
00:10:59,854 --> 00:11:01,053
No, really, she's just a friend.

224
00:11:01,088 --> 00:11:04,056
Yeah, yeah.

225
00:11:04,091 --> 00:11:06,358
Mr. Fox,

226
00:11:06,394 --> 00:11:07,660
just the man I've been wanting to see.

227
00:11:07,695 --> 00:11:10,362
Oh, joy. Mr. Nygma.

228
00:11:10,398 --> 00:11:11,730
Heard you were stopping by.

229
00:11:11,766 --> 00:11:14,166
I have questions.

230
00:11:14,201 --> 00:11:16,368
- Hopefully, you have answers.
- Or what?

231
00:11:16,404 --> 00:11:17,736
You'll poison me with gas?

232
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:20,906
That gas was a sleeping agent.

233
00:11:20,942 --> 00:11:24,176
And to be fair, I was not in
the best place in my life.

234
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,113
To be fair,

235
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:29,381
if you ever threaten my life

236
00:11:29,417 --> 00:11:31,684
or the life of Bruce Wayne again,

237
00:11:31,719 --> 00:11:33,252
I will find a way to end you.

238
00:11:33,287 --> 00:11:35,654
Mr. Fox, we both know you're
not a man of violence.

239
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:36,922
No, I am not.

240
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:40,159
If I was, I would've laced
some piece of lab equipment,

241
00:11:40,194 --> 00:11:43,262
one which you were sure
to touch, with a toxin.

242
00:11:43,297 --> 00:11:44,563
Ricin, maybe.

243
00:11:44,599 --> 00:11:46,932
I'd use Saxitoxin. Harder to trace.

244
00:11:46,968 --> 00:11:48,767
But I like your style.

245
00:11:48,803 --> 00:11:50,069
You are insane.

246
00:11:50,104 --> 00:11:51,437
Was insane.

247
00:11:51,472 --> 00:11:53,070
I have a certificate.

248
00:11:53,808 --> 00:11:56,575
- So, the Red Hoods?
- See for yourself.

249
00:12:05,019 --> 00:12:08,120
The gang's getaway vehicle
was abandoned in the Narrows.

250
00:12:08,155 --> 00:12:09,254
As you'll notice,

251
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:13,225
its carpet fibers has
elements of dirt, oil,

252
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,661
and, oddly, potassium chloride.

253
00:12:16,697 --> 00:12:18,897
A halide salt.

254
00:12:20,201 --> 00:12:22,901
Fascinating.

255
00:12:22,937 --> 00:12:24,169
So nothing on Ivy Pepper,

256
00:12:24,205 --> 00:12:27,172
but an odd report came
in a few weeks ago, okay?

257
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:29,141
A construction worker claimed

258
00:12:29,176 --> 00:12:32,378
that a redhead knocked
him out, robbed him,

259
00:12:32,413 --> 00:12:33,979
and she left this.

260
00:12:34,015 --> 00:12:35,981
That's Ivy's sweater.

261
00:12:36,017 --> 00:12:37,483
How do we find this man?

262
00:12:37,518 --> 00:12:39,385
I already called, all
right? The guy's down south

263
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,320
on a job, but he swore up and down

264
00:12:41,355 --> 00:12:42,454
that the redhead who rolled him...

265
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:45,124
- was in her 20s.
- So?

266
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:47,159
He's probably covering for
being with a young girl.

267
00:12:47,194 --> 00:12:50,195
Doubtful he would come
forward in the first place.

268
00:12:50,231 --> 00:12:52,297
Yeah, most pervs don't want to
call attention to themselves.

269
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:54,533
So it wasn't Ivy.

270
00:12:54,568 --> 00:12:56,402
It seems unlikely, but why
would she have Ivy's sweater?

271
00:12:56,437 --> 00:12:58,170
Dr. Thompkins.

272
00:12:58,205 --> 00:13:00,339
Bruce, it's good to see you again.

273
00:13:00,374 --> 00:13:01,473
You got taller.

274
00:13:01,509 --> 00:13:04,043
Like I said, right? The
kid's growing like a weed.

275
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:05,511
Nice to see you, too.

276
00:13:05,546 --> 00:13:08,247
Uh, Jim, could I have a word?

277
00:13:10,351 --> 00:13:12,584
Wanted you to hear it from me, um,

278
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,353
my engagement announcement is coming out

279
00:13:14,388 --> 00:13:15,487
in The Gazette tomorrow.

280
00:13:15,523 --> 00:13:18,424
And it will feature Mario's name.

281
00:13:20,194 --> 00:13:21,560
I think that's customary.

282
00:13:21,595 --> 00:13:23,696
His family name.

283
00:13:23,731 --> 00:13:24,763
You mean Falcone.

284
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:26,598
You knew?

285
00:13:27,404 --> 00:13:28,600
You knew and you didn't say anything?

286
00:13:28,636 --> 00:13:29,601
Sure I did.

287
00:13:29,637 --> 00:13:30,903
I said congratulations.

288
00:13:30,938 --> 00:13:32,938
- Don't be cute.
- Lee.

289
00:13:32,973 --> 00:13:35,040
People talk.

290
00:13:35,076 --> 00:13:37,710
Was I surprised? Sure.

291
00:13:37,745 --> 00:13:39,111
But it's also none of my business.

292
00:13:39,146 --> 00:13:41,046
Your life is your life.

293
00:13:41,082 --> 00:13:42,881
And I meant what I said.

294
00:13:42,917 --> 00:13:44,450
Very happy for you.

295
00:13:45,906 --> 00:13:47,519
So, that's it?

296
00:13:47,555 --> 00:13:50,122
That's it.

297
00:13:52,993 --> 00:13:56,929
Okay, um, well, I just...
wanted to tell you.

298
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:09,508
Dr. Thompkins.

299
00:14:11,846 --> 00:14:14,279
I had heard that you were back.

300
00:14:14,315 --> 00:14:15,894
I'm so glad...

301
00:14:19,687 --> 00:14:20,953
That's for Kristen.

302
00:14:20,988 --> 00:14:22,988
You shouldn't have done that. Or what?

303
00:14:23,023 --> 00:14:25,290
I'm supposed to be scared of you
because you work for Penguin?

304
00:14:25,326 --> 00:14:28,761
My fiancé's father is Carmine Falcone.

305
00:14:28,796 --> 00:14:30,629
I so much as whisper to him,

306
00:14:30,664 --> 00:14:33,132
and you disappear.

307
00:14:34,935 --> 00:14:37,603
Tell the mayor, whatever I can
do as M.E., I'm happy to help.

308
00:14:44,779 --> 00:14:47,146
It's bad enough we're
throwing Penguin's party.

309
00:14:47,181 --> 00:14:48,313
It's good for the club.

310
00:14:48,349 --> 00:14:49,982
Now we're his errand girls?

311
00:14:50,017 --> 00:14:53,051
Sweetie, we find the
Red Hoods, he'll owe us.

312
00:14:53,087 --> 00:14:55,487
We can ask for a favor,
say him not killing you?

313
00:14:55,523 --> 00:14:57,322
Well, it would be nice not
to have to watch my ass

314
00:14:57,358 --> 00:14:59,358
all the time.

315
00:15:02,196 --> 00:15:03,529
Well, well.

316
00:15:03,564 --> 00:15:05,197
Who do we have here?

317
00:15:05,232 --> 00:15:07,299
Guy calls himself the Ballistic Bomber.

318
00:15:07,334 --> 00:15:09,668
My contact at the Merc saw him buying

319
00:15:09,703 --> 00:15:11,236
- smoke grenades last week.
- Ooh.

320
00:15:11,272 --> 00:15:13,605
Just like the ones the
Red Hoods used on Penguin.

321
00:15:13,641 --> 00:15:15,240
Groovy.

322
00:15:15,276 --> 00:15:16,275
Reckon he'll talk?

323
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:18,544
Of course.

324
00:15:18,579 --> 00:15:20,646
No!

325
00:15:20,681 --> 00:15:22,414
Maybe give him a moment.

326
00:15:22,449 --> 00:15:23,649
Now remember, kids,

327
00:15:23,684 --> 00:15:26,318
you tell the press this
is all Penguin's fault.

328
00:15:28,189 --> 00:15:30,656
- Good.
- Yes, sir.

329
00:15:30,691 --> 00:15:31,957
Light it up.

330
00:15:31,992 --> 00:15:34,693
- Oh, mercy.
- Please. No, no.

331
00:15:34,728 --> 00:15:36,528
Better run, Sister,

332
00:15:36,564 --> 00:15:37,529
'fore the Padre goes boom.

333
00:15:37,565 --> 00:15:39,531
Lord Jesus!

334
00:15:39,567 --> 00:15:41,300
Don't!

335
00:15:41,335 --> 00:15:43,869
Wait, wait! The grenade is slipping!

336
00:15:46,707 --> 00:15:48,640
Seriously, a priest?

337
00:15:48,676 --> 00:15:50,275
You should've seen it.

338
00:15:50,311 --> 00:15:51,577
Ka-boom!

339
00:15:51,612 --> 00:15:53,545
But you told 'em what to say?

340
00:15:53,581 --> 00:15:56,215
- This is all because of Penguin?
- Yeah, boss, but I don't get it.

341
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,750
You want to take out
Penguin, let's take him out.

342
00:15:58,786 --> 00:16:00,219
This Red Hood stuff is fun,

343
00:16:00,254 --> 00:16:01,420
but it's a lot of work.

344
00:16:01,455 --> 00:16:02,721
How about you just do what I tell you?

345
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:08,527
Now, I got you these

346
00:16:08,562 --> 00:16:11,563
so you'll blend in at the party tonight.

347
00:16:11,599 --> 00:16:12,631
Huh? Huh?

348
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:15,000
Nice suit.

349
00:16:15,035 --> 00:16:17,569
And that's when we kill him?

350
00:16:17,605 --> 00:16:18,704
No!

351
00:16:18,739 --> 00:16:20,706
No one kills Penguin.

352
00:16:20,741 --> 00:16:21,707
You should.

353
00:16:21,742 --> 00:16:23,909
'Cause he's going to murder you.

354
00:16:28,315 --> 00:16:30,282
Time to have a heart-to-heart, Butch.

355
00:16:30,317 --> 00:16:32,651
Alone.

356
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:43,366
You don't have to buy lunch.

357
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:46,369
I know you're a billionaire,
but I can buy you a sandwich.

358
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:49,506
Do you miss it?

359
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,007
Being a cop?

360
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:52,609
Sometimes, yeah.

361
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:55,278
Gave a sense of mission.

362
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:56,446
True.

363
00:16:56,481 --> 00:16:58,799
There's more to life
than having a mission.

364
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:05,155
Look, I'll keep asking
around about Ivy, but, uh...

365
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,691
you want my advice,

366
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:09,226
talk to Selina.

367
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,462
Tell her how you feel.

368
00:17:14,766 --> 00:17:17,534
Does that actually work?

369
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:18,735
Sometimes.

370
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:20,904
It's definitely better
than being silent.

371
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:23,139
Before you know it, the moment passes.

372
00:17:24,267 --> 00:17:26,676
And are you taking your own advice?

373
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,245
Afraid that ship has sailed.

374
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,512
I'm not talking about Dr. Thompkins,

375
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:30,981
I'm talking about the
woman you're seeing now.

376
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:32,315
Excuse me?

377
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:34,818
There was lipstick on a
coffee mug on your table.

378
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:37,520
You've become quite the detective.

379
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:40,357
So, are you?

380
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:43,226
It's complicated.

381
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:46,596
- So is Selina.
- That I believe.

382
00:17:50,006 --> 00:17:52,469
I just wish sometimes...

383
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:54,571
I had a sign.

384
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:56,539
Unfortunately, life doesn't
usually work that way.

385
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:57,707
We're hours away

386
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,877
from Mayor Cobblepot's
victory celebration.

387
00:18:00,912 --> 00:18:02,946
But people are asking,
will the Red Hood Gang

388
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:04,614
put a damper on the festivities?

389
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:07,117
Sounds like Penguin's having a bad day.

390
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:09,519
I'm supposed to go to his party tonight.

391
00:18:09,554 --> 00:18:11,388
Part of my re-engagement
with being a Wayne.

392
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:12,856
Mm.

393
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:14,767
Well, give the mayor my best.

394
00:18:14,818 --> 00:18:18,194
Witnesses say the Red Hoods
blamed Cobblepot for their ac...

395
00:18:23,651 --> 00:18:25,468
Someone is testing me, Ed.

396
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:27,337
They're thinking, "Oh, he's mayor now.

397
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:28,938
He has to play by different rules."

398
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:31,141
No, they'll see,

399
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:33,276
when I'm roasting their
entrails over a fire.

400
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:35,745
Perhaps I'm thinking
about this all wrong.

401
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,380
Perhaps this is not about you at all.

402
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,582
What if this is about the statue?

403
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:40,950
Of course it's about me!

404
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:42,285
Yes, you're probably right. Oh, dear.

405
00:18:43,488 --> 00:18:45,288
- Wonderful.
- Oswald.

406
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:46,356
Take a breath.

407
00:18:49,127 --> 00:18:50,827
What are you doing?

408
00:18:50,862 --> 00:18:52,662
It's an old trick I learned in the lab.

409
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:54,785
Most solvents have as their base...

410
00:18:57,102 --> 00:18:58,968
I am the son of water,

411
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:00,437
but if water touches me, I die.

412
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,072
- What am I?
- Again with the riddles.

413
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:03,940
Salt. Most people think
of it as a food additive,

414
00:19:03,975 --> 00:19:06,509
but potassium salt is
found in detergents,

415
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:09,446
- soaps...
- What is your point, Ed?

416
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:12,315
I know where the Red Hoods are.

417
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:14,918
I say we give him to Penguin.

418
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:17,120
Knowing Penguin will
gut him like a fish.

419
00:19:17,155 --> 00:19:18,755
Ladies, come on.

420
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:21,591
- After all we've been through...
- It's his life for yours.

421
00:19:21,626 --> 00:19:22,826
Simple.

422
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:25,095
I don't get it.

423
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,596
Why'd you turn on him now?

424
00:19:26,631 --> 00:19:27,997
I wasn't gonna hurt Penguin.

425
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:29,033
Honest.

426
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:32,001
I was gonna take down
the Red Hoods myself.

427
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:34,334
Tonight. At the party.

428
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,172
All this so you could play the hero?

429
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,642
Ever since Nygma got out of Arkham,

430
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,644
Penguin treats me like I'm nothing.

431
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,447
That pencil-neck's
trying to push me out.

432
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:46,216
Let me ask you, we
figured out you're the man

433
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:48,017
behind the Red Hoods, how
long do you think it'll take

434
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:49,053
Penguin and his lap dog?

435
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:52,756
It's your life, baby.

436
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,592
You make the call.

437
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,530
Let me see this through.

438
00:20:00,565 --> 00:20:02,866
I get my place beside Penguin back,

439
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:04,734
I'll protect you.

440
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:08,905
Oh, you'll do more than that.

441
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,350
You'll owe me.

442
00:20:11,129 --> 00:20:13,810
And one day, I'm gonna collect.

443
00:20:15,213 --> 00:20:17,380
Gilzean.

444
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:18,882
Butch, where are you?

445
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:20,350
The Red Hood Gang is
at a detergent factory

446
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:23,086
in the Narrows. We're on our way.

447
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:24,454
I got to go.

448
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:28,691
Get your things.

449
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,693
We're done. I'm breaking up the band.

450
00:20:31,771 --> 00:20:34,164
I'm serious, go! Get out of Dodge.

451
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:36,756
Yeah, well, not for nothing,
but you promised us a payday.

452
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:39,502
We're not leaving till we get it.

453
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:55,952
Well, I guess it was gonna
happen sooner or later.

454
00:20:55,987 --> 00:20:57,657
What?

455
00:21:00,091 --> 00:21:01,791
Sorry, boys.

456
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:18,241
I did it, boss.

457
00:21:18,276 --> 00:21:20,510
I got 'em for you.

458
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,579
Peace and order have
once again been restored

459
00:21:33,624 --> 00:21:35,171
to Gotham.

460
00:21:35,222 --> 00:21:37,060
The Red Hood Gang is no more.

461
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:41,971
My very own man, Butch Gilzean,

462
00:21:41,997 --> 00:21:45,465
risked life and limb to
face down the bandits.

463
00:21:46,868 --> 00:21:49,736
Was your life ever in danger, Butch?

464
00:21:49,771 --> 00:21:52,539
I can honestly say that
if I'd have hesitated,

465
00:21:52,574 --> 00:21:54,340
I'd have been a goner.

466
00:22:03,051 --> 00:22:04,884
All right, people, listen up!

467
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,053
It's happy hour...
Finish up those reports

468
00:22:07,088 --> 00:22:08,969
and let's call it a day!

469
00:22:14,529 --> 00:22:18,197
Hey, uh... Ed.

470
00:22:18,233 --> 00:22:20,166
Even before you went crazy,

471
00:22:20,201 --> 00:22:21,234
I never liked you.

472
00:22:21,269 --> 00:22:22,302
Your zipper's down.

473
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:26,539
Listen, Butch did us all a favor.

474
00:22:26,575 --> 00:22:28,808
Red Hoods go bye-bye, case closed.

475
00:22:28,843 --> 00:22:30,610
Look at the way the bodies fell.

476
00:22:30,645 --> 00:22:32,879
It's as if they were just standing
there, waiting to be killed.

477
00:22:32,914 --> 00:22:34,380
Butch comes all the way in the room,

478
00:22:34,416 --> 00:22:36,349
but only one man pulled out a gun.

479
00:22:36,384 --> 00:22:37,750
I guess they weren't threatened.

480
00:22:37,786 --> 00:22:40,286
By a 300-pound gorilla?

481
00:22:40,322 --> 00:22:42,889
Whose side are you on, anyway, hmm?

482
00:22:42,924 --> 00:22:45,892
No one's losing sleep over
a bunch of dead crooks,

483
00:22:45,927 --> 00:22:48,428
least of all me.

484
00:22:48,463 --> 00:22:50,129
I said wrap it up!

485
00:22:56,571 --> 00:22:58,838
What have we here?

486
00:23:12,354 --> 00:23:13,786
Burning the midnight oil?

487
00:23:13,822 --> 00:23:16,589
I was just finishing up.

488
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:18,891
I'm guessing you're
here to reprimand me.

489
00:23:18,927 --> 00:23:22,061
Reprimand you? For what?

490
00:23:22,097 --> 00:23:23,997
Punching Nygma in the jaw.

491
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:26,099
I just couldn't help myself.

492
00:23:26,134 --> 00:23:27,667
First I'm hearing of it.

493
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:30,837
Well done, Doctor.

494
00:23:32,307 --> 00:23:35,742
Actually, I'm here to ask about, uh...

495
00:23:35,777 --> 00:23:38,077
Alice Tetch's blood, if
you've heard anything.

496
00:23:38,113 --> 00:23:39,946
As it happens, I just received

497
00:23:39,981 --> 00:23:42,115
the preliminary results
back from the lab.

498
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:44,951
- Fascinating.
- What is?

499
00:23:44,986 --> 00:23:47,487
They injected samples
into a group of rats.

500
00:23:47,522 --> 00:23:49,122
After three days, two of the rats

501
00:23:49,157 --> 00:23:51,924
were showing marked increases
in strength and stamina.

502
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,926
Oh? That doesn't sound so bad.

503
00:23:53,962 --> 00:23:56,529
But the study ended after one of
the rats killed all the others.

504
00:23:57,732 --> 00:23:59,032
I'm guessing that's not normal.

505
00:23:59,067 --> 00:24:01,267
It chewed through a dozen wire cages

506
00:24:01,302 --> 00:24:03,536
to get at them... no.

507
00:24:06,741 --> 00:24:08,941
Well, why would one
of the rats go psycho

508
00:24:08,977 --> 00:24:10,309
and not the others?

509
00:24:10,345 --> 00:24:11,778
Perhaps the others hadn't had a chance

510
00:24:11,813 --> 00:24:14,347
to show any symptoms,
or they were immune.

511
00:24:14,382 --> 00:24:16,616
Some people live with
a disease for years

512
00:24:16,651 --> 00:24:18,818
without having any adverse effects.

513
00:24:18,853 --> 00:24:21,054
The lab is starting a new study now.

514
00:24:21,089 --> 00:24:24,490
Well, keep me informed.

515
00:24:26,061 --> 00:24:29,462
Oh, and, uh... don't stay too late.

516
00:24:29,497 --> 00:24:31,030
I'm sure that fiancé of yours

517
00:24:31,066 --> 00:24:32,899
would like to see you once in a while.

518
00:24:32,934 --> 00:24:35,068
And was the captain of the GCPD invited

519
00:24:35,103 --> 00:24:37,503
to our new mayor's victory party?

520
00:24:37,539 --> 00:24:40,039
You know, I lost my invitation.

521
00:24:46,614 --> 00:24:48,026
I can feel it.

522
00:25:01,963 --> 00:25:03,496
Heard you took down the Red Hood Gang

523
00:25:03,531 --> 00:25:05,598
single-handed.

524
00:25:05,633 --> 00:25:07,033
So to speak.

525
00:25:07,068 --> 00:25:08,735
- Very funny.
- Don't forget,

526
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:10,603
you owe me.

527
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,744
I know.

528
00:25:21,116 --> 00:25:22,448
How long do we have to stay?

529
00:25:22,484 --> 00:25:23,850
As long as it takes for you to be seen

530
00:25:23,885 --> 00:25:25,852
in the world, Master Bruce...

531
00:25:25,887 --> 00:25:27,920
being Bruce Wayne.

532
00:25:27,956 --> 00:25:29,789
And smiling.

533
00:25:31,326 --> 00:25:33,092
So this is our life now?

534
00:25:33,128 --> 00:25:35,762
Fake smiles and mingling.

535
00:25:35,797 --> 00:25:37,630
I miss the old days.

536
00:25:44,572 --> 00:25:46,205
- So nice.
- Oh, excuse me.

537
00:25:46,241 --> 00:25:47,406
Yes.

538
00:25:47,442 --> 00:25:49,375
Bruce, Mr. Pennyworth,

539
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:51,077
I'm so pleased you made it.

540
00:25:51,112 --> 00:25:52,078
Yeah, well, you know, we're trying to

541
00:25:52,113 --> 00:25:53,746
get out a bit more, Mr. Mayor.

542
00:25:53,782 --> 00:25:55,782
Oswald, please.

543
00:25:55,817 --> 00:25:57,817
We never got the chance to thank you

544
00:25:57,852 --> 00:25:59,819
for saving our lives from the ex-mayor.

545
00:25:59,854 --> 00:26:02,588
Not at all.

546
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:04,390
I find it very fortuitous
you turned up when you did

547
00:26:04,425 --> 00:26:06,025
with that bazooka.

548
00:26:07,829 --> 00:26:09,595
I just felt a bit sorry
for Stan, the gardener,

549
00:26:09,631 --> 00:26:12,895
'cause he was picking up
bits of Galavan for weeks.

550
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:19,071
And now here you are, the new mayor.

551
00:26:19,107 --> 00:26:21,107
Sometimes life has a way of working out.

552
00:26:21,142 --> 00:26:23,342
Yes, that's true.

553
00:26:27,315 --> 00:26:28,681
What is it, Master Bruce?

554
00:26:28,716 --> 00:26:31,818
A sign.

555
00:26:31,853 --> 00:26:33,286
Please excuse me.

556
00:26:35,957 --> 00:26:37,790
Right, well, I'll just
go and wet my beak.

557
00:26:37,826 --> 00:26:40,693
Congratulations again, Mr. Mayor.

558
00:26:48,036 --> 00:26:50,466
- Hey!
- Hey yourself.

559
00:26:51,172 --> 00:26:54,607
Funny, I never realized
how short you were.

560
00:26:54,642 --> 00:26:57,117
Who the hell are you?

561
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:00,947
Not yet. This is too fun.

562
00:27:00,982 --> 00:27:02,448
Run along, little kitty.

563
00:27:02,483 --> 00:27:05,751
Go steal some more wallets.

564
00:27:05,787 --> 00:27:06,986
Hey.

565
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:11,691
So sweet.

566
00:27:11,726 --> 00:27:13,893
There he is, the man of the hour.

567
00:27:13,928 --> 00:27:15,194
I have a surprise for you, Butch.

568
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:16,829
Not in the mood.

569
00:27:20,168 --> 00:27:21,701
What's in the box?

570
00:27:21,736 --> 00:27:23,603
Open it.

571
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:30,910
Thanks.

572
00:27:30,945 --> 00:27:33,646
- I already got one.
- Oh, of course you do.

573
00:27:33,681 --> 00:27:34,981
And you certainly
wouldn't need this one,

574
00:27:35,016 --> 00:27:37,483
as it's so similar to your
very own pocket square.

575
00:27:37,518 --> 00:27:38,985
This is from the Red Hood crime scene.

576
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:41,354
It turns out that your suit

577
00:27:41,389 --> 00:27:42,388
and the Red Hood suits were all made

578
00:27:42,423 --> 00:27:44,190
by the same tailor, Mr. Fuji.

579
00:27:44,225 --> 00:27:46,692
That's some coincidence.

580
00:27:46,728 --> 00:27:48,027
I thought so myself.

581
00:27:48,062 --> 00:27:50,162
Which is why I called
Mr. Fuji, and he said

582
00:27:50,198 --> 00:27:51,597
that a large man with a metal hand...

583
00:27:51,633 --> 00:27:52,665
Not many of those running around...

584
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,166
Bought all six of the suits,

585
00:27:54,202 --> 00:27:56,969
which means, ta-da, you're
the architect of the Red...

586
00:27:59,407 --> 00:28:02,341
I should snap your neck right now.

587
00:28:03,912 --> 00:28:06,545
You haven't heard my offer.

588
00:28:12,053 --> 00:28:13,352
We kill Penguin together.

589
00:28:14,956 --> 00:28:16,622
What are you talking about?

590
00:28:16,658 --> 00:28:19,292
- You're his guy.
- Oh, please. You fell for that act?

591
00:28:19,327 --> 00:28:20,593
Yes, he broke me out of Arkham...

592
00:28:20,628 --> 00:28:22,061
Very appreciative...

593
00:28:22,096 --> 00:28:23,896
But I was not cut out to be number two.

594
00:28:23,932 --> 00:28:25,398
I've simply been waiting for my moment,

595
00:28:25,433 --> 00:28:27,967
which you have graciously provided.

596
00:28:28,002 --> 00:28:32,838
How would you like to
run Gotham with me?

597
00:28:36,644 --> 00:28:39,278
The two of us... working together?

598
00:28:39,314 --> 00:28:41,480
You have proven yourself far
more cunning than I imagined.

599
00:28:41,516 --> 00:28:43,249
Now, I assume this little drama of yours

600
00:28:43,284 --> 00:28:44,717
was meant to climax tonight.

601
00:28:44,752 --> 00:28:49,588
So put on the hood, kill Penguin...

602
00:28:49,624 --> 00:28:51,557
I'll help you escape.

603
00:28:51,592 --> 00:28:53,626
Tomorrow we divide up the city.

604
00:28:56,264 --> 00:28:57,964
You'd really turn on him,

605
00:28:57,999 --> 00:29:00,099
after all he did for you?

606
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:03,936
In a heartbeat.

607
00:29:09,377 --> 00:29:10,576
No.

608
00:29:10,611 --> 00:29:13,012
Okay.

609
00:29:13,047 --> 00:29:15,881
Then I guess it's time
for surprise number two.

610
00:29:20,621 --> 00:29:23,356
- You got to Zsasz?
- I got to Zsasz.

611
00:29:24,993 --> 00:29:27,793
And he got to Tabitha.

612
00:29:27,829 --> 00:29:29,528
Penguin's history.

613
00:29:29,564 --> 00:29:33,232
The question is, are you?

614
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:47,727
Can I see your invitation?

615
00:29:48,455 --> 00:29:50,054
What are you doing here?

616
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:52,323
- I was invited.
- Of course you were.

617
00:29:54,161 --> 00:29:55,260
You recognize her?

618
00:29:57,998 --> 00:29:59,564
Should I?

619
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:01,332
I don't know.

620
00:30:04,004 --> 00:30:05,336
Hey, are you, you...

621
00:30:05,372 --> 00:30:08,158
- I'm me.
- Uh-huh.

622
00:30:08,842 --> 00:30:10,642
Well, I'm working, so...

623
00:30:10,677 --> 00:30:13,422
Actually, there was something
I wanted to tell you.

624
00:30:14,214 --> 00:30:15,547
Could we go somewhere more private?

625
00:30:18,418 --> 00:30:20,752
Fine, but make it quick.

626
00:30:27,794 --> 00:30:29,861
I can't believe you'd
turn on Oswald, too.

627
00:30:29,896 --> 00:30:33,031
Uh, hello. Pot, kettle, black.

628
00:30:33,066 --> 00:30:36,067
No, it's not the same thing. You...

629
00:30:36,102 --> 00:30:38,069
Never mind.

630
00:30:38,104 --> 00:30:39,704
I swear, your goons hurt Tabitha,

631
00:30:39,739 --> 00:30:40,905
so help me...

632
00:30:40,941 --> 00:30:43,975
Just do your job.

633
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:45,777
Oh...

634
00:30:45,812 --> 00:30:48,213
showtime.

635
00:30:48,248 --> 00:30:49,747
Put on in the mayor

636
00:30:49,783 --> 00:30:51,850
before I put one in Tabitha.

637
00:30:54,688 --> 00:30:56,988
Ladies, gentlemen,

638
00:30:57,023 --> 00:30:58,957
welcome to The Sirens.

639
00:30:58,992 --> 00:31:01,326
Tonight we're here to celebrate

640
00:31:01,361 --> 00:31:04,295
the Honorable Mayor Cobblepot.

641
00:31:04,331 --> 00:31:06,197
Our savior from the monsters,

642
00:31:06,233 --> 00:31:08,933
and the captain of our fair city.

643
00:31:08,969 --> 00:31:11,903
And now, the mayor would
like to say a few words.

644
00:31:13,273 --> 00:31:14,873
Ed, where've you been?

645
00:31:14,908 --> 00:31:16,074
I've been looking for you all evening.

646
00:31:16,109 --> 00:31:17,275
Oh, just tying up loose ends.

647
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:19,577
I just wanted to say...

648
00:31:19,613 --> 00:31:21,012
good luck.

649
00:31:21,047 --> 00:31:23,114
Okay. Thank you.

650
00:31:29,489 --> 00:31:30,655
Thank you.

651
00:31:35,762 --> 00:31:37,462
Hmm.

652
00:31:37,497 --> 00:31:42,033
Tonight is a celebration,
not of my victory,

653
00:31:42,068 --> 00:31:43,902
but of Gotham's.

654
00:31:43,937 --> 00:31:44,969
This is a new day!

655
00:31:52,304 --> 00:31:54,545
I wouldn't celebrate yet, Mr. Mayor.

656
00:31:54,581 --> 00:31:56,047
Red Hoods ain't finished yet.

657
00:31:56,082 --> 00:31:57,282
Ed!

658
00:31:57,317 --> 00:31:58,616
- What are you doing?!
- Wait!

659
00:31:58,652 --> 00:31:59,984
Sorry, boss.

660
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:02,120
Butch?!

661
00:32:07,627 --> 00:32:08,826
- Huh?
- Oops.

662
00:32:14,267 --> 00:32:16,634
The mayor...

663
00:32:17,804 --> 00:32:20,338
our mayor... vowed that all

664
00:32:20,373 --> 00:32:22,307
of the Red Hoods would be destroyed.

665
00:32:22,342 --> 00:32:24,175
And now we have the
real leader caught...

666
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:27,284
red... handed.

667
00:32:30,583 --> 00:32:33,418
You really thought I'd
give you real bullets?

668
00:32:33,453 --> 00:32:35,720
You are an idiot!

669
00:32:37,958 --> 00:32:40,648
I will kill you for this!

670
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,330
Sounds like we're missing all the fun.

671
00:32:45,365 --> 00:32:46,931
Got plenty of fun left for you.

672
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:50,268
You know, if you're gonna take
a girl hostage in her own place,

673
00:32:50,303 --> 00:32:51,669
you might want to search it first.

674
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,181
After all that I've done for you!

675
00:33:03,216 --> 00:33:06,651
- I gave you a job!
- I gave you everything!

676
00:33:06,686 --> 00:33:09,654
I used to be somebody in this town,

677
00:33:09,689 --> 00:33:11,956
then you and that sniveling
little son of a...

678
00:33:14,361 --> 00:33:16,427
Shut up!

679
00:33:21,868 --> 00:33:24,135
I am shocked...

680
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:25,903
and grieved...

681
00:33:26,899 --> 00:33:30,174
that one of my dearest
friends has betrayed me.

682
00:33:31,745 --> 00:33:35,013
But let it be known
that Oswald Cobblepot

683
00:33:35,048 --> 00:33:38,216
will prosecute anyone
who threatens Gotham!

684
00:33:38,251 --> 00:33:39,517
Hear, hear!

685
00:33:40,553 --> 00:33:41,553
Yeah!

686
00:33:43,056 --> 00:33:44,589
Upsy-daisy.

687
00:33:47,027 --> 00:33:48,893
Oh, my God.

688
00:33:50,797 --> 00:33:52,063
Showtime.

689
00:33:56,269 --> 00:33:58,603
Oswald, move.

690
00:34:00,573 --> 00:34:02,573
I am gonna enjoy this.

691
00:34:05,445 --> 00:34:07,845
Best... party... ever.

692
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:10,848
Wait.

693
00:34:10,884 --> 00:34:12,250
- Not now.
- Ed!

694
00:34:14,587 --> 00:34:15,753
Ed!

695
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:17,790
Ed!

696
00:34:18,825 --> 00:34:20,224
Ed!

697
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:22,560
Oh!

698
00:34:32,913 --> 00:34:34,179
So, what's up?

699
00:34:34,214 --> 00:34:37,282
I hired Jim Gordon to
help me locate Ivy.

700
00:34:37,318 --> 00:34:39,851
And?

701
00:34:39,887 --> 00:34:41,720
There was a redhead
that had her sweater,

702
00:34:41,755 --> 00:34:43,522
but it wasn't Ivy.

703
00:34:45,728 --> 00:34:48,293
Saying it out loud, I realize,
doesn't sound that impressive.

704
00:34:48,329 --> 00:34:49,561
No, it doesn't.

705
00:34:49,596 --> 00:34:51,763
That's really why you
brought me up here?

706
00:34:54,635 --> 00:34:57,069
You are the real Bruce...

707
00:34:57,104 --> 00:34:59,327
'cause nobody else would be this boring.

708
00:35:00,274 --> 00:35:02,766
- Great work, detective.
- That's not all.

709
00:35:07,748 --> 00:35:10,282
We've been friends a long time, Selina.

710
00:35:10,317 --> 00:35:11,316
And ever since you've known me,

711
00:35:11,352 --> 00:35:12,851
I've been dedicated to one thing,

712
00:35:12,886 --> 00:35:14,619
but that's done.

713
00:35:14,655 --> 00:35:16,154
I don't know what's next, but I know...

714
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:18,890
Would you, please...
just say what you mean?

715
00:35:18,926 --> 00:35:20,058
I like you...

716
00:35:21,628 --> 00:35:23,829
as more than a friend.

717
00:35:29,002 --> 00:35:30,936
It would be nice if you
said something back.

718
00:35:33,216 --> 00:35:35,483
How many girls have you dated?

719
00:35:35,518 --> 00:35:37,418
What do you mean?

720
00:35:37,453 --> 00:35:39,220
It's not a trick question.

721
00:35:39,255 --> 00:35:40,721
How many girls have you dated?

722
00:35:40,757 --> 00:35:43,090
- None.
- None. Hmm.

723
00:35:43,126 --> 00:35:45,092
Have you ever thought that maybe

724
00:35:45,128 --> 00:35:46,460
you only like me because

725
00:35:46,496 --> 00:35:48,095
I'm literally the only girl you know?

726
00:35:48,131 --> 00:35:49,930
That's not true. I feel something.

727
00:35:49,966 --> 00:35:51,966
And I know you do, too. We're the same.

728
00:35:52,001 --> 00:35:53,801
In what universe are we the same?

729
00:35:53,836 --> 00:35:55,603
- The money doesn't matter.
- Try not having it.

730
00:35:55,638 --> 00:35:57,772
It matters.

731
00:36:02,912 --> 00:36:05,267
There's something between us.

732
00:36:05,681 --> 00:36:07,615
I know there is.

733
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:10,017
You have to see that.

734
00:36:11,921 --> 00:36:13,921
Rule one.

735
00:36:14,724 --> 00:36:16,657
Don't ever tell me

736
00:36:16,692 --> 00:36:18,292
what I have to do.

737
00:36:27,437 --> 00:36:30,037
So, you do have feelings for me?

738
00:36:30,073 --> 00:36:33,232
- I'm confused.
- Good.

739
00:36:42,585 --> 00:36:44,552
Come on, just tell me.

740
00:36:44,587 --> 00:36:47,788
I got all dressed up.
I even put on lipstick.

741
00:36:47,824 --> 00:36:49,123
I could lose my job.

742
00:36:49,158 --> 00:36:50,658
What are you offering?

743
00:36:50,693 --> 00:36:53,060
Fine, then I'll say something.

744
00:36:53,096 --> 00:36:55,863
If I'm right, you just nod.

745
00:36:55,898 --> 00:36:59,300
You ran tests on Alice Tetch's blood.

746
00:36:59,335 --> 00:37:00,835
You found something in her blood.

747
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:04,472
A virus, or infection or something.

748
00:37:04,507 --> 00:37:06,369
Do I have to go over the rules again?

749
00:37:06,421 --> 00:37:09,210
Let's have new rules, sweetie.

750
00:37:09,245 --> 00:37:12,480
I'll tell you what we're
doing with Alice Tetch's blood

751
00:37:12,515 --> 00:37:14,081
and in return...

752
00:37:14,117 --> 00:37:15,249
you...

753
00:37:15,284 --> 00:37:16,751
O...kay.

754
00:37:18,754 --> 00:37:19,954
Excuse me?

755
00:37:19,989 --> 00:37:22,089
What are you doing?

756
00:37:23,392 --> 00:37:26,327
Two whiskeys and a pineapple
juice for this guy.

757
00:37:26,362 --> 00:37:27,728
What's going on?

758
00:37:27,763 --> 00:37:30,231
- To go.
- What's going on?

759
00:37:32,235 --> 00:37:33,601
I think you were just leaving.

760
00:37:36,772 --> 00:37:38,339
Forget this.

761
00:37:38,374 --> 00:37:40,074
Trust me. I'm gonna try.

762
00:37:45,481 --> 00:37:46,947
What are you doing here?

763
00:37:46,983 --> 00:37:48,649
Just walking by.

764
00:37:48,684 --> 00:37:49,917
Saw you through the window.

765
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:52,186
- Took it as a sign.
- Like hell.

766
00:37:52,221 --> 00:37:54,021
You tracked me here.

767
00:37:54,056 --> 00:37:55,956
And for the record,

768
00:37:55,992 --> 00:37:57,491
I could've gotten what I wanted

769
00:37:57,527 --> 00:37:59,793
from that creep without
compromising my honor.

770
00:37:59,829 --> 00:38:01,662
I know...

771
00:38:01,697 --> 00:38:02,897
but you don't have to.

772
00:38:04,267 --> 00:38:05,866
I'll tell you what you want to know.

773
00:38:08,964 --> 00:38:11,545
I thought you wanted to keep the
woman and the reporter separate.

774
00:38:11,597 --> 00:38:13,066
- Is that an option?
- No.

775
00:38:14,742 --> 00:38:15,980
Well, then.

776
00:38:19,796 --> 00:38:22,229
You are gonna have to
buy me dinner, though.

777
00:38:22,265 --> 00:38:24,331
What's good here?

778
00:38:35,378 --> 00:38:36,977
It's ginger tea with honey.

779
00:38:37,013 --> 00:38:39,815
It's my mother's remedy
for a sore throat.

780
00:38:42,084 --> 00:38:43,717
You sure you don't need a doctor?

781
00:38:43,753 --> 00:38:45,686
No, I'm fine.

782
00:38:47,423 --> 00:38:48,522
I still don't understand

783
00:38:48,558 --> 00:38:50,493
why you didn't tell me
what you were doing.

784
00:38:52,041 --> 00:38:56,003
Your shock when seeing
Butch had to be genuine.

785
00:38:56,466 --> 00:38:59,200
The people had to believe it...

786
00:38:59,235 --> 00:39:00,267
and they did.

787
00:39:00,303 --> 00:39:02,236
And once again, you're the city's hero.

788
00:39:04,774 --> 00:39:06,574
But you were almost killed.

789
00:39:06,609 --> 00:39:09,543
And you saved me... again.

790
00:39:13,983 --> 00:39:16,335
I hope you know, Oswald...

791
00:39:17,253 --> 00:39:19,186
I would do anything for you.

792
00:39:21,757 --> 00:39:23,791
You can always count on me.

793
00:39:32,001 --> 00:39:33,200
Thank you.

794
00:39:49,118 --> 00:39:50,484
Need a hand, kitten?

795
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:53,087
I got it.

796
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:09,670
Hold on, Butch.

797
00:40:18,933 --> 00:40:21,682
Sir, the ambulance carrying
Butch Gilzean was just hijacked.

798
00:40:21,717 --> 00:40:23,083
Damn it!

799
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:24,418
Put out a BOLO.

800
00:40:24,453 --> 00:40:26,086
I'll call the mayor.

801
00:40:40,403 --> 00:40:42,770
Oh, yes.

802
00:40:46,676 --> 00:40:48,842
M-M-Mister, please.

803
00:40:48,878 --> 00:40:50,444
Shh.

804
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:55,649
My dear, sweet sister.

805
00:40:55,685 --> 00:40:57,451
Just look...

806
00:40:57,486 --> 00:41:00,120
at what he did to you.

807
00:41:00,156 --> 00:41:02,556
He took you from me!

808
00:41:02,592 --> 00:41:06,961
We belonged... together!

809
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:10,030
And he killed you.

810
00:41:10,066 --> 00:41:13,567
But, mister, I-I'm not dead.

811
00:41:17,234 --> 00:41:19,707
If only that were true.

812
00:41:33,656 --> 00:41:38,425
Those who hurt you...

813
00:41:38,461 --> 00:41:41,495
will feel my pain...

814
00:41:43,265 --> 00:41:47,334
when my sweet and terrible vengeance

815
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:49,937
upon them rains.
