[IRIS LAUGHS]

471
00:30:02,676 --> 00:30:07,222
As big a surprise as Eddie punching Barry
at a crime scene this evening.

472
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:09,266
Oh, my God. Is Barry okay?

473
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:12,227
Yeah, he heals fast.

474
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:14,396
Look, Iris, this got complicated.

475
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:17,733
I know. I'm sorry.

476
00:30:18,442 --> 00:30:20,110
Barry was too late. I'm with Eddie.

477
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:23,530
Let me ask you something.

478
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:27,743
Who do you love?

479
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:30,829
I mean, I love Eddie.

480
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:33,999
Okay. You need to make them believe that...

481
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:36,251
...because I'm not sure
either of them does.

482
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,337
Okay?

483
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,967
Did I ever tell you
how wise and amazing you are?

484
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:45,427
Not enough.

485
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:46,678
See you later.

486
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:52,934
-Bad time?
-Yes, actually.

487
00:31:08,742 --> 00:31:11,453
Don't worry, I'll be out of here soon.

488
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:16,166
Well, before you shuffle off forever...

489
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:17,959
...may I show you something?

490
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:27,886
I get it.

491
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:30,722
-I failed.
-No, no, no.

492
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:33,225
Now, you're an incredibly clever guy, Cisco.

493
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:36,353
So why don't you tell me...

494
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:38,688
...why would I bring you down here?

495
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:45,695
Because we all failed that night,
but we kept going.

496
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:52,077
We kept trying to protect each other
and Barry, despite the setbacks.

497
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:55,747
Making a choice between
two people you love...

498
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:58,208
...that is the hardest dilemma
you will ever face.

499
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:03,380
Well, you won't have to worry about me
making the wrong decision again.

500
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:06,299
All you proved today, Mr. Ramon...

501
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:07,717
...is that you're human.

502
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:11,888
All you proved today
is that you love your brother.

503
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:16,435
And the reason that we all want you to stay...

504
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:18,437
...is that we love you too.

505
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:22,732
Now, I am not a parent...

506
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:29,239
...but in many ways, you have shown me
what it's like to have a son.

CAITLIN [OVER INTERCOM]:
<i>Guys, you should get up here.</i>

508
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:37,873
Shall we?

509
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:44,296
The casino wasn't the target.

510
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,047
Then why did he do it?

511
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:50,093
Casinos keep tons of cash on hand
to cover their markers.

512
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:54,097
But if they're under attack, protocol
is to relocate the money outside the casino.

513
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:57,559
So that was Snart's plan all along,
to trigger the move.

514
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:58,852
Okay, where is it now?

515
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:14,284
Get ready. We got company.

Good to see you, Barry.

519
00:34:12,342 --> 00:34:14,261
We have to talk.

520
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:18,473
I know Cisco told you who I am.

521
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:21,476
Can't really blame the kid for giving you up.

522
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:25,272
You or his brother? Come on.
I put him in a tight spot.

523
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,899
Same kind I got you in right now.

524
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:31,736
Can't really stop me,
now that I know who you are.

525
00:34:31,945 --> 00:34:35,657
I could speed you to my private prison
where you'll never see the light of day.

526
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:38,618
But then I won't be around
to stop my own private uplink...

527
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:43,665
...that'll broadcast your identity to the world.
So the million-dollar question:

528
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,501
What to do with me now, Barry Allen?

529
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:50,505
I won't let you keep stealing
whatever you want, whenever you feel like it.

530
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,507
-It needs to end.
-Can't do that.

531

-It's what I do.
-Find a new line of work.

532
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,512
-Don't want to.
-Why's that?

533
00:34:58,013 --> 00:35:00,807
The same reason
you keep running after guys like me.

534
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:03,143
The adrenaline. The thrill of the chase.

535
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:07,814
I love this game. And I'm very good at it.

536
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:09,691
Then go play it somewhere else.

537
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:12,193
-Leave Central City.
-Can't do that either.

538
00:35:12,402 --> 00:35:14,029
I love it here.

539
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:16,114
This city is my home.

540

You've seen what I can do.

You know that I can stop you.

542

You wanna keep pushing your luck, go for it.

543

But from here on out, no one else dies.

544
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:33,715
If you're as good as you say...

545
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,468
...you don't have to kill anyone
to get what you want.

546
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:40,180
That's true.

547
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:48,229
And if you or anyone
in your rogues gallery...

548

...goes near
any of my friends or family again...

549

...I don't care who you tell my identity to.

But what exactly
did you have no idea about?

I was just explaining to Iris and
Eddie about your Lightning Psychosis.

-My what now?
-Your Lightning Psychosis.

564

How your recent odd behavior
is a side effect of being struck by lightning.

565

and other lapses in judgment.

He has had all of those things.
He told me that he had ESP.
