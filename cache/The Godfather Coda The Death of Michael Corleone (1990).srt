1
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:08,766
<i>Don Corleone,</i> I need your help.

2
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:11,606
And not just to light a little candle.

3
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:19,828
My gift was to be able to persuade
people to give to the Holy Church.

4
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:25,788
Then Rome decides to put me
in charge of the Vatican Bank...

5
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:30,667
but I was never a true banker.

6
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:37,929
Mea culpa. I trusted my friends.

7
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:41,007
Friendship and money...

8
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:45,594
Oil and water... Indeed.

9
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:52,944
But these "friends" used the good name
of the Church to feed their greed.

10
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:56,568
If money was lost...

11
00:01:57,868 --> 00:01:59,734
then I am to blame.

12
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:07,076
If only prayer could pay off
our 700 million dollar deficit.

13
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,127
769 million...

14
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:22,302
The Church owns 25 percent
of a large corporation. Immobiliare.

15
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:25,434
You know the one I mean?

16
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,014
Largest landlord on Earth.
Real estate worth six billion dollars.

17
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:33,942
That's true.

18
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:38,648
And the Vatican vote
is necessary for control.

19
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:44,077
No, you're mistaken.

20
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:47,498
This isn't a question
of one person deciding.

21
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,074
One deciding vote.

22
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:54,881
This is like any other company.
We have directors and very old rules.

23
00:02:56,051 --> 00:03:00,136
The Pope himself
would have to approve you.

24
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,808
We've sold the casinos.

25
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:11,480
All businesses having to do
with gambling.

26
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:18,359
We have no interests or investments
in anything illegitimate.

27
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:25,782
The Corleones are prepared to deposit
500 million dollars in the Vatican Bank

28
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:29,740
when Mr. Corleone receives
majority control of Immobiliare.

29
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:34,671
Immobiliare could be something new.
A European conglomerate.

30
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:40,463
Few families have control
of such a company.

31
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:45,969
It seems that, in today's world,

32
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:50,937
the power to absolve debt is greater
than the power of forgiveness.

33
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,190
600 million dollars.

34
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:03,574
Don't overestimate
the power of forgiveness.

35
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:09,746
Don Corleone, this
deal with Immobiliare

36
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,245
can make you
one of the richest men in the world.

37
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:15,794
Your whole past history,
and the history of your family,

38
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:19,545
and your children,
would be washed away.

39
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:23,923
600 million.

40
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:43,985
<i>The only wealth
in this world is children.</i>

41
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,984
<i>More than all the money
and power on earth,</i>

42
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:50,578
<i>you are my treasure.</i>

43
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:56,369
<i>Although I entrusted your education to
your mother for your own best interest,</i>

44
00:04:56,463 --> 00:05:01,799
<i>I look forward to seeing you, and to
a new period of harmony in our lives.</i>

45
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:07,213
<i>Perhaps you might prevail upon your
mother to come to this celebration.</i>

46
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:56,766
Vincent, our name is not on the list.

47
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:03,395
Write it in. Mancini. M-A-N-C-I-N-I.

48
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:07,649
- Problem?
- My name isn't on the list.

49
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:12,532
- Then you have to leave immediately.
- You want to dance with me?

50
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:15,990
Joe, it's Vinnie. These are our guests.

51
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,995
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, sir.

52
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,327
Welcome to the party.

53
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:13,006
- It's good to see you.
- Good to see you. This is my husband.

54
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,386
- Sit down.
- My son, Anthony.

55
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:21,313
The Order of Saint Sebastian is one of
the highest honors the Church awards.

56
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,982
It was first granted by Pope...

57
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:27,232
What about Mr. Corleone's connections
with gambling?

58
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:29,400
The press kits have...

59
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:31,823
What about his involvement
with the underworld?

60
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,275
Cut the crap.

61
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:36,912
The Pope, the Holy Father himself,

62
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:41,583
has today blessed Michael Corleone.
Do you know better than the Pope?

63
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:45,795
Vincent! She loves you.

64
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,338
Yeah?

65
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:52,799
I love you too.

66
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:02,062
Hi, Vincent. I remember you.

67
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:07,852
- From where?
- The last party we were at together.

68
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:11,029
- Did you come to the club?
- No, it was a wedding.

69
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:16,201
I was eight and you were 15.

70
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:19,947
I had many girlfriends when I was 15.

71
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,248
- Eight-year-olds?
- Especially them.

72
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,711
Where's Mary?

73
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:31,383
Would somebody please hail Mary?
Excuse me, Your Excellency.

74
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:36,005
You haven't kissed me hello yet.
Relatives always kiss.

75
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:39,558
- Now we're related?
- I'm your little cousin.

76
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:50,607
- Who's your father?
- I'll give you a hint.

77
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,655
He's Italian.

78
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:57,451
Mary, we've been waiting for you.

79
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:01,576
Remember to keep your voice low.

80
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,158
And smile. Don't forget to smile.

81
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,547
Daddy, I'm so nervous.

82
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:28,057
The honorary chairman of
the Vito Corleone Foundation,

83
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:31,067
my daughter, Mary Corleone.

84
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:42,203
Thanks.

85
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:48,665
I think I inherited my father's love
for speechmaking. Here it goes.

86
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:54,800
The Vito Corleone Foundation helps
the poor in every country,

87
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:59,346
gives grants to artists,
funds medical research,

88
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:03,892
and is particularly dedicated
to the resurrection of Sicily.

89
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,724
Archbishop Gilday,

90
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:11,901
here is 100 million dollars for the poor
of Sicily, in the name of Vito Corleone.

91
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,147
Don't spend it all in one place.

92
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:39,299
Mary, I'm so proud of you.

93
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,061
Michael...

94
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:50,981
You've done a wonderful thing
for Sicily.

95
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,524
Let's hope that the money gets
to the people who need it.

96
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:56,853
Amen.

97
00:10:56,948 --> 00:11:02,068
The most important part:
Johnny Fontane!

98
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:13,917
Thank you very much.
I'm happy to be here.

99
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:19,093
I would like you to join me in honoring
Commendatore Michael Corleone.

100
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:27,226
I have something special
for our godfather.

101
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:31,601
I happen to know his favorite song.
Michael, where are you going?

102
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:35,355
I'm off to the kitchen
to hear some Tony Bennett records.

103
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,488
Your favorite song, "Salsiccia's Own".

104
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:42,692
I'm having a salsiccia sandwich.
I'll be back.

105
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:18,651
Hello, Kay.

106
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,995
Congratulations, Michael.
That's quite an honor.

107
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:35,077
But a little expensive,
wouldn't you say?

108
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:40,916
- Cake?
- No, thank you.

109
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:58,104
- It's been a long time, hasn't it?
- Yeah.

110
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,105
- Eight years.
- Yeah.

111
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:02,733
You look wonderful.

112
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:10,988
Your son has something he wants to
talk to you about. I came here for him.

113
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:51,241
- What's wrong with being a lawyer?
- He wants his life to be in music.

114
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:57,417
Music is great, I love music.
But he should finish what he started.

115
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:58,868
Anthony...

116
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,914
- I'm going my own way.
- Your own way?

117
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,757
- Professional singer?
- Yes.

118
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,711
What happens if you fail?

119
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:11,343
- I won't fail.
- Men always believe that.

120
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:15,644
A law degree is like
taking out insurance.

121
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:20,265
- After that you can work for me...
- I will never work for you.

122
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,401
I have bad memories.

123
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,610
Every family has bad memories.

124
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:35,539
I'll always be your son, but won't have
anything to do with your business.

125
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:42,212
Anthony... finish the law degree.

126
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,710
No.

127
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:06,152
Well, that he got from you. That "no".

128
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:14,237
- You could've helped me convince him.
- Convince him of what?

129
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,154
Of what?

130
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,535
He throws his life away.

131
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,705
He throws greatness away.

132
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:24,458
This is greatness?

133
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:30,427
Now that you're so respectable,
you're more dangerous than ever.

134
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:34,632
I preferred you when you were
just a common Mafia hood.

135
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,050
Okay.

136
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:41,563
- Can we talk common sense here?
- All right.

137
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,981
Tony knows that you killed Fredo.

138
00:15:57,707 --> 00:16:01,120
- What did you come here for?
- To protect my son.

139
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:06,125
Not to see you disguised by your church.
That was a shameful ceremony.

140
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:13,257
I spent my life protecting my son.

141
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:17,549
I spent my life protecting my family!

142
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,634
Let's be reasonable, okay?

143
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:25,315
That's your big thing, isn't it,
Michael? Reason,

144
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:29,736
- backed up by murder.
- Oh, God.

145
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:34,741
- You hate me. You hate me.
- No.

146
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,534
I don't hate you.

147
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,322
I dread you.

148
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:50,174
I did what I could, Kay, to protect all
of you from the horrors of this world.

149
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:53,923
But you became my horror.

150
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:07,107
The children still love you, though.
Especially Mary.

151
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:11,899
That's something.

152
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:17,905
We can build on that. For their sake,

153
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,247
let's try.

154
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:29,004
Only if you let Tony go free to have
his own life, away from you.

155
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,304
I'll let Tony go.

156
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,383
Thank you.

157
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:19,049
- Hi.
- Hi.

158
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:26,433
You could hurt somebody with those.
Let me show you around.

159
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,638
Can you get me an interview
with Corleone?

160
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:33,193
No. I'm a relative, but I can't do that.
What else can I do for you?

161
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:37,564
- Handsome, but useless.
- Oh, yeah?

162
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:40,571
- That's okay, I'll gamble.
- Do you like to gamble?

163
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:44,450
Let's go to Atlantic City.
I'll show you how to gamble.

164
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:48,829
- How do I know what numbers to bet?
- Do I look like a guy who's gonna lose?

165
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:50,668
Well...

166
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:55,252
Spooky-looking guy there.

167
00:18:56,093 --> 00:19:00,929
- What's a guy like that doing here?
- That's Joey Zasa's bulldog.

168
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:03,097
- You know him?
- Yeah, I do.

169
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:08,475
His name is Anthony Squigilaro.
They call him "The Ant".

170
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,602
He dips his bullets in cyanide.

171
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,075
Don Altobello.

172
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:27,038
- I've come to pay my respects.
- <i>Grazie.</i>

173
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:33,002
You honor my father's friendship.

174
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:35,171
Where is my goddaughter?

175
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:39,213
- Constanza!
- Don Altobello.

176
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:44,256
It was not so long ago
that I held you in these old hands.

177
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:57,941
Michael, I've lost all the venom,
all the juice of youth.

178
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:03,241
I've lost the lust for women,
and now my mind is clear.

179
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:10,283
My duty to God is clear.
I have a special favor to ask of you.

180
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:18,757
Can I attach my name
to the Vito Corleone Foundation,

181
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:24,471
so that you and I can be joined
in name and spirit?

182
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,641
One million dollars.

183
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:31,978
A lot of money...

184
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:38,651
- Godfather.
- Don Altobello, you have such a heart.

185
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:45,984
Come, let's go and sample
some of that old <i>vino.</i>

186
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:56,252
The Vatican knows nothing
about these shareholders.

187
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,544
Good.

188
00:20:57,631 --> 00:21:02,501
I have a tendency to worry. We've
increased our position substantially.

189
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:07,135
- Naturally, I worry.
- Stop worrying, we have an agreement.

190
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:11,100
Good. How do you think
I got this gray hair?

191
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:16,933
Two seconds... Thank you for your
contribution to the swimming-pool.

192
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:21,236
We need your help on Sam Wallace's
candidacy for judgeship.

193
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:23,905
- We can always use a good judge.
- Thanks.

194
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,652
Andrew!

195
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:29,702
My godson Andrew Hagen.
My brother Tom's eldest boy.

196
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:34,283
He's been assistant to Bishop Breelan
for three years.

197
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:38,711
- Hopes to be assigned to the Vatican.
- Rome needs fine young priests.

198
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:41,790
His mother Teresa Hagen,
Bishop Gilday.

199
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:43,676
Honored to meet you.

200
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:47,344
Mr. Corleone. Hi. Grace Hamilton.

201
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:53,176
Vincent Mancini promised to tell you
about me. That maybe you'd see me.

202
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:56,639
- Did Vincent Mancini call about her?
- No.

203
00:21:56,732 --> 00:22:01,226
- You promised to stay out there, twice.
- I know.

204
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:06,030
Joey Zasa showed up.
He's waiting in the lobby.

205
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:10,155
<i>He wants to personally
congratulate you. Show his respect.</i>

206
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:15,707
- Do I have to see him?
- He says you're his <i>patron.</i>

207
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:21,041
Hey, Vinnie!

208
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,669
- Who's your favorite aunt?
- You are.

209
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:30,881
Today I'll talk to Michael
about your little problem.

210
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:34,893
If you'd warned me,
I would have worn a better suit.

211
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:39,305
The Meucci Association has elected you

212
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,017
Italian-American Man of the Year.

213
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,269
Meucci...

214
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:49,482
Who's Meucci?

215
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:57,074
The Italian-American who invented
the telephone, one year before Bell.

216
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:03,788
And this is the reason
you've come today?

217
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,255
I...

218
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,806
I've got a stone in my shoe.

219
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:21,773
A two-bit punk who works for me.

220
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:26,064
The one who thinks he's related to you.

221
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:29,780
A bastard.

222
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:38,118
He's here. Vincent Mancini.
He's at the party.

223
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,035
Bring him in.

224
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:46,957
I think it's good that we talk.

225
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,800
No, <i>grazie.</i>

226
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:53,591
I have a problem...

227
00:23:54,183 --> 00:24:00,475
and I want to find out if it is
my problem or your problem.

228
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:05,604
Your business is your business. I have
no interests or percentages from it.

229
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:10,192
Good. Then it's my problem.

230
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:18,996
Michael, you know Vincent Mancini.
Sonny's boy.

231
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:24,119
- How are you, Mr. Corleone?
- How are you?

232
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:28,047
- Good. How are you? Good party.
- You like it?

233
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:31,296
- Yes, I had to sneak in.
- You're dressed for it.

234
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:40,014
So, what's the trouble
between you and Mr. Joe Zasa?

235
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:46,566
- Just trouble. I'll take care of it.
- That's foolish of you.

236
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:48,313
Foolish of me?

237
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:50,486
It's a little foolish of this guy,
don't you think?

238
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:51,858
Right?

239
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:56,568
- Right?
- Temper like his father...

240
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:58,577
Vincent...

241
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:05,167
Mr. Joe Zasa now owns what used to be
the Corleone business in New York.

242
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:10,172
Out of kindness,
he gave you a job in his family.

243
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:12,921
You took it against my advice.

244
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:18,303
I offered you something better in the
legitimate world. You turned me down.

245
00:25:18,392 --> 00:25:23,307
Now you both come to me with this bad
blood. What do you expect me to do?

246
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:27,478
- Am I a gangster?
- No...

247
00:25:27,568 --> 00:25:31,857
That was Papa's neighborhood.
Zasa runs it like a disgrace!

248
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:36,191
- That's the past, Connie.
- I earned that territory.

249
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:40,028
The Commission gave it to me
and you approved.

250
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:41,157
Yes.

251
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:46,334
I came for the party, not to ask
for help. I could kill this bastard.

252
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,785
SO kill him.

253
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:51,836
What does all this have to do with me?

254
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:57,420
Well, he goes behind your back,
saying "Fuck Michael Corleone".

255
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:59,926
Say it to his face, one time!

256
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:06,896
Mr. Corleone, all bastards are liars.
Shakespeare wrote poems about it.

257
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:09,974
What am I going to do with this guy?

258
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:20,951
Joey, if there's some guy
running around this city,

259
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:23,325
saying, "Fuck Michael Corleone"...

260
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:28,334
what do we do
with a piece of shit like that?

261
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:32,083
He's a fucking dog.

262
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:43,425
Yes, it's true.
If anyone would say such a thing,

263
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:46,887
they would not be a friend,
they would be a dog.

264
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:59,274
- My interests don't conflict with his.
- You don't know how much they do.

265
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:00,858
Quiet, Vincent.

266
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:03,160
He needs your support!

267
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:06,114
Don't let me work for this guy,
let me work for you.

268
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:12,079
As what? Tough guy. I don't need
tough guys. I need more lawyers.

269
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:21,505
Since we have no conflicts or debts,
I accept your tribute. I wish you well.

270
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:27,768
Vincent, make your peace
with Mr. Joe Zasa. Go on.

271
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:40,360
<i>Bastardo...</i>

272
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,871
Vinnie, what's the matter with you?

273
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:50,870
Get him out of here.

274
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:54,370
Jesus Christ...

275
00:27:55,716 --> 00:27:57,878
I told Connie
this wasn't the right time.

276
00:27:57,968 --> 00:27:59,049
Close it.

277
00:27:59,136 --> 00:28:03,050
I know you're into Wall Street,
but you're still the final word.

278
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:06,053
I want to protect you from these guys.
Your lawyers can't.

279
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:08,760
- But you can?
- Yeah, I can do that.

280
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:12,354
Why should I be afraid of Zasa?

281
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:15,775
You stop him from rising
in the Commission.

282
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:19,195
I say we make him dead.
Give me the order, I'll do it.

283
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:21,192
- You'll do it?
- Yeah.

284
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:30,331
Maybe you should come with me
for a few weeks. See what happens.

285
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:33,083
- Okay.
- See if you learn.

286
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:37,205
And we'll talk about your future.

287
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:40,625
I won't let you down.

288
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:49,137
It's about ready.

289
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:56,515
So, what happened?

290
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:57,725
What happened?

291
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:01,153
If I'm in a room with Zasa,
what happens? I bit his ear off.

292
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,447
Here we go. Watch the card.

293
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:07,451
Hold it!

294
00:29:09,957 --> 00:29:11,743
- Vincent...
- Yeah.

295
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:14,120
Take the picture with us.

296
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,837
Nice jacket.

297
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:27,467
Closer to the center, sir.

298
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,425
Smile!

299
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:56,326
Godfather, this is the cake for you
and your family from Enzo the baker.

300
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:59,498
Do you want to do it?

301
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:48,343
Cent'anni! Cent'anni!

302
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:53,887
Cent'anni!

303
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:51,273
- Vincent?
- What do you want, sweetheart?

304
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:55,323
Do you love me?

305
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:59,452
- Come on, go to bed.
- Come on, say it.

306
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:03,126
I love you.

307
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:05,458
I love you, too.

308
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:09,837
You've got a cat?

309
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:19,677
Go get us some water, I'm thirsty.
Come on.

310
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:22,137
Come on.

311
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:32,319
Well, I guess I know my place.

312
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:36,027
I can't believe I'm actually doing this.

313
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:40,536
"Get me water, bake me a cake"...
What happened to "please"?

314
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:30,922
Good boy, Sackface. Go for a walk.

315
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:43,219
- Let her go.
- Cut her throat, man.

316
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:48,899
- What did you say?
- Cut her fucking throat.

317
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:55,280
- Okay, chief...
- Drop your gun or he'll cut her throat.

318
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:59,611
I hardly know her, so cut her.
What the fuck do I care?

319
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:05,245
You've got no choice. She'll be dead.

320
00:34:05,335 --> 00:34:09,329
If you do, I'll kill you both.
Give up that knife, I'll let you go.

321
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:10,708
Cut her throat! Right now!

322
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:18,262
I'll do something that'll convince you.
Don't get frightened. Just watch me.

323
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:24,510
Oh, shit!

324
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:29,398
Drop the knife. Drop it!

325
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:34,695
Good boy. Sit down, I want to talk
to you. It was a wise choice. Sit down.

326
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:37,739
Lose the mask.

327
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:42,611
Relax, have a smoke. You smoke?

328
00:34:46,293 --> 00:34:48,785
Whose idea was this? Who sent you?

329
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:51,628
Tell me who sent you.

330
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:57,422
- No one.
- Did you take a look at this guy?

331
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,594
- Yeah.
- Who sent you?

332
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:04,633
It was Joey Zasa.

333
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:20,987
Are you okay?

334
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:27,414
- You were going to let them kill me!
- No, I wasn't...

335
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,992
You pig! You sick fuck!

336
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:35,790
You wanted gambling. That's gambling.
Call the police.

337
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:44,090
- You killed the other guy too?
- He went for my gun.

338
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:48,102
It was self-defense.
Go ahead, call the police.

339
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:51,309
- No, no...
- I'm taking pictures.

340
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:53,015
No pictures.

341
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:56,143
<i>You had a gun!</i>

342
00:35:56,571 --> 00:36:01,407
They only had a knife. You could have
handed them over to the police.

343
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:05,490
Zasa sent them.
I just sent him a message.

344
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:11,747
- Now he has to send you one back.
- Zasa is going to send me one back?

345
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:14,749
He did the right thing.
He got Zasa's name!

346
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:18,582
What has Joey Zasa to do
with anything? Joey Zasa is a <i>pazzo.</i>

347
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:24,800
All right. You are what you are.

348
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:28,266
It's your nature. Stay close to me.

349
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:32,187
Don't do anything.
Keep your mouth shut and your eyes open.

350
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:35,524
- And you do what I tell you.
- I understand.

351
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:38,978
- I have problems with the Commission.
- I know.

352
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:43,737
- You don't make them easier.
- It wasn't my idea that this happened.

353
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:47,281
- Get out of here.
- Michael...

354
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:49,071
Yes?

355
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:54,581
- Now they'll fear you.
- Maybe they should fear <i>you.</i>

356
00:36:58,508 --> 00:37:02,342
- B.J., what's up?
- The Archbishop just called back.

357
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:05,296
We've arranged some amazing things.

358
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:09,349
The publicity is phenomenal. You're
the new Rockefeller. A philanthropist.

359
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:15,098
- Sigh here, please.
- Times do change, don't they?

360
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:20,315
My father hated foundations.
He loved doing it by himself.

361
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:24,026
Man to man. But we're different.

362
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:29,612
No different than any large corporation.
We control a lot of money with little.

363
00:37:29,706 --> 00:37:34,121
Minimize taxes.
With no government control.

364
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:45,965
- Godfather.
- Andrew.

365
00:37:48,183 --> 00:37:52,302
- Off to Rome...
- I wanted to thank you for everything.

366
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:55,937
- Do you want some breakfast?
- Thanks, I can't.

367
00:37:56,524 --> 00:38:00,438
- How's your Italian?
- <i>Devo fare un po' di pratica.</i>

368
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:03,983
- His father was a great lawyer.
- I know.

369
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:07,486
Didn't live to see him ordained. I did.
Did you ever see one of those?

370
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:12,321
Beautiful. I was so proud.
Let me walk you out.

371
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:16,242
If you hear any rumors in the Vatican,
let me know.

372
00:38:16,336 --> 00:38:18,873
No, Andrew has the true faith.

373
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:25,627
<i>The motion under discussion
relates to Corleone Group's proposal</i>

374
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:31,557
<i>to acquire 100,000,000 newly issued
Class A voting shares.</i>

375
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:39,644
<i>Corleone capital invested
directly in to International Immobfliere,</i>

376
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:44,023
<i>an old and respected
European company.</i>

377
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:47,773
Mr. Corleone has
an ambitious program

378
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:50,450
to expand this real estate company

379
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:53,529
into an international conglomerate...

380
00:38:56,584 --> 00:39:02,455
by Eastern techniques of efficiency
and focus and unlimited...

381
00:39:02,549 --> 00:39:04,586
Mr. Corleone, excuse me.

382
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:08,672
Didn't you recently deposit 200 million
in the Vatican Bank,

383
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:11,801
which is affiliated with Immobiliare?

384
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:13,507
True. Why not?

385
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:20,143
Wasn't there any questioning about
the timing on this particular deposit?

386
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:22,395
Mr. Chairman, if I may?

387
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:28,697
The Vito Andolini Corleone Foundation,
of which Mary Corleone is chairman,

388
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:31,992
has made an endowment
of 100 million dollars.

389
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:36,572
The money comes from his own family
and will be administered by the Vatican.

390
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:38,873
Does that answer your question?

391
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:44,747
My fellow shareholders, if Europe
and America can learn to co-operate,

392
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:49,176
if we can learn to pool our wealth,
share our markets,

393
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:53,756
we can defeat any competition
anywhere in the world.

394
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:57,176
Thank you for your time.

395
00:39:57,270 --> 00:40:01,889
I hope that you will look favorably
on my proposal. Thank you.

396
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:07,270
Let me have this microphone here.

397
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:12,449
Will we let a criminal run our company?
He's got the map of Sicily on his face!

398
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:13,535
Order!

399
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:16,157
He's either a Catholic or a mafioso...

400
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:19,289
Mr. Chairman...

401
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:24,875
the Vatican Bank feels
that International Immobiliare...

402
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:29,003
will be safe in Mr. Corleone's hands.

403
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:32,761
Subject to audit
and final ratification,

404
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:34,838
which must take place in Rome.

405
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:38,221
Please join me in welcoming
Mr. Michael Corleone.

406
00:40:46,653 --> 00:40:51,898
Mary! Mary, this is real.
This foundation is real.

407
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:59,913
I wanted Anthony to be part of it.
I thought you would be together on this.

408
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:04,493
I won't interfere.
I'll help, but only if you ask.

409
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:06,578
What is this really for?

410
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:10,711
Why are you doing this?
Why am I doing this?

411
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:17,389
I'm doing this for my children.
You're doing it for your children too.

412
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:21,097
This foundation is supposed to
help all people.

413
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:22,769
That's the purpose.

414
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:28,441
This is legitimate.
Mary, I swear, this is legitimate.

415
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:35,531
Dad, I want this to bring me
closer to you.

416
00:41:44,127 --> 00:41:47,836
I would burn in hell to keep you safe.

417
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:04,766
Go in the other car.
I'll ride with Michael.

418
00:42:05,148 --> 00:42:06,684
Go, go, go.

419
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:25,499
Your old partners are grateful
for the money you made them.

420
00:42:25,585 --> 00:42:27,371
They worship you...

421
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:34,250
but their hearts are broken, because
they think you abandoned them.

422
00:42:35,011 --> 00:42:41,178
They want to share your deal
on Immobiliare, to be a family again.

423
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:43,884
It can purify their money.

424
00:42:46,189 --> 00:42:47,975
This I cannot do.

425
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:53,606
Immobiliare must be legitimate.

426
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:57,405
I know.

427
00:42:58,451 --> 00:43:00,488
But they're unhappy.

428
00:43:02,622 --> 00:43:03,953
And you?

429
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:10,286
I ask nothing for myself.
Only peace in my old age.

430
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:14,047
But I must please the world around me.

431
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:22,051
Michael, your father was
a reasonable man. Learn from him.

432
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,723
I learnt many things from my father.

433
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:38,863
Call a meeting, my friend,
so there are no debts or grudges.

434
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:42,867
We will make the peace, you and I.

435
00:44:00,263 --> 00:44:03,051
<i>The Vatican announced today...</i>

436
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:07,016
<i>that Pope Paul VI has canceled his
Sunday blessing...</i>

437
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:09,018
<i>due to ill health.</i>

438
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:12,097
<i>His physician has ordered total bedrest...</i>

439
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:15,058
<i>and cessation of all activities.</i>

440
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:24,780
They've had a press conference.

441
00:44:24,871 --> 00:44:28,034
The Pope's condition
is grave. <i>"Gravissimo."</i>

442
00:44:57,361 --> 00:45:00,649
The purpose of this meeting is to ratify...

443
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:04,400
the motion passed by our
shareholders in New York.

444
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:07,114
Please...

445
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:12,662
Our group represents a consortium
of Catholic businessmen

446
00:45:12,752 --> 00:45:15,619
against the Corleone control.

447
00:45:16,589 --> 00:45:21,379
The Vatican has cast its vote. Corleone
Group already controls the Board.

448
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:26,588
According to the Lateran Treaty,
the Vatican vote must be ratified here.

449
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:28,798
Here in Rome, by the Pope.

450
00:45:32,897 --> 00:45:36,015
The Pope is gravely ill.

451
00:45:37,485 --> 00:45:41,023
Until he recovers, I am powerless.

452
00:45:42,365 --> 00:45:45,027
- What if he dies?
- Then...

453
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,243
as you Americans say,
all bets are off.

454
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,658
Gentlemen, please.

455
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:56,418
This is a brief delay. Nothing more.

456
00:46:01,509 --> 00:46:03,796
Your Excellency, gentlemen...

457
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:10,348
I advise you to join us in our prayers
for the Holy Father's recovery.

458
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:13,468
We had an agreement!

459
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:18,606
This meeting was to be
merely a formality.

460
00:46:18,693 --> 00:46:24,029
- Please sit down.
- I'd rather stand. Give me an answer.

461
00:46:24,115 --> 00:46:29,610
The Immobiliare has its roots in the
European tradition. Please understand.

462
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:33,906
I understand.
Your tactics are despicable.

463
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,118
That's quite an indictment,
coming from a Corleone.

464
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:41,546
- Gentlemen, gentlemen!
- Remember you are in the Vatican.

465
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:51,135
- What is it that you want?
- Yes, you will take control.

466
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:55,643
We'll gladly put you at the helm
of our little fleet,

467
00:46:56,314 --> 00:47:00,148
but our ships must all sail
in the same direction.

468
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:07,318
Otherwise, who can say how long
your stay with us will last?

469
00:47:09,577 --> 00:47:15,414
It's not personal. It's only business.
You should know, Godfather.

470
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:20,751
Very well.

471
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:27,009
You want to do business with me?
I will do business with you.

472
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:30,131
Vipers, all of them.

473
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:39,270
- We're back with the Borgias!
- Uncle Michael...

474
00:47:39,357 --> 00:47:42,645
- Andrew!
- I heard you were here.

475
00:47:42,735 --> 00:47:46,273
It's so nice to see you.
Vincent, it's so nice.

476
00:47:47,156 --> 00:47:50,524
What is this about
the Borgias? Those days are over.

477
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:58,163
- Recognize it?
- Yeah.

478
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:05,755
Genco Olive Oil. That's where our
grandfather started as a delivery boy.

479
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:08,173
Three years later he owned it.

480
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,467
- Only in America.
- That's it.

481
00:48:11,514 --> 00:48:16,634
Vincenzo, where have you been hiding?
We need your help so badly.

482
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:20,516
- What can I do for you?
- Get rid of Joe Zasa. He sells drugs...

483
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:25,396
Now that I'm an older woman,
I'm afraid to go out at night.

484
00:48:25,486 --> 00:48:27,978
Where should they be new?

485
00:48:28,072 --> 00:48:31,155
- Lou, what's going on?
- We're late.

486
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:35,861
- Have I ever let you down?
- I trust you.

487
00:48:35,955 --> 00:48:38,287
- Don't worry.
- Thank you.

488
00:48:38,374 --> 00:48:40,081
Enjoy yourselves.

489
00:48:47,675 --> 00:48:49,882
The neighborhood's in trouble.

490
00:48:49,969 --> 00:48:52,961
- Do you keep an eye out for them?
- Yes.

491
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:55,922
- And for me?
- From now on.

492
00:48:56,934 --> 00:49:00,928
- I've missed you all this time.
- I missed you too, cousin.

493
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:05,731
I missed growing up with my cousins.
I didn't even know you, but missed you.

494
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:11,275
Do you remember stories about
our fathers? The old days?

495
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:13,732
Yeah, what do you want to know?

496
00:49:16,412 --> 00:49:21,748
- What was Sonny like?
- Well, he was the Prince of the City.

497
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:27,003
He died before I was born,
but I've heard a lot about him.

498
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:32,250
- What about my father?
- He's a great man.

499
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:36,341
He's a hero. He saved the family.

500
00:49:38,184 --> 00:49:39,925
- Vincent?
- What?

501
00:49:40,019 --> 00:49:42,260
Did he kill his own brother?

502
00:49:46,609 --> 00:49:47,815
No.

503
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:52,065
So, it's all lies?

504
00:49:56,494 --> 00:49:59,657
Just stories, sweetheart. Okay?

505
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:05,082
Okay.

506
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:10,789
- I'm glad you're around.
- I'm glad you're here too.

507
00:50:15,763 --> 00:50:17,253
<i>Cugina...</i>

508
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:19,509
Cous...

509
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:37,444
I'd like to take Joey Zasa for a ride
in this and drop him.

510
00:50:37,535 --> 00:50:40,072
Joey Zasa is nothing.

511
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:44,372
He's a small time enforcer.
He bluffs and threatens.

512
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:48,577
He's nothing.
You can see him coming a mile away.

513
00:50:49,547 --> 00:50:52,130
- We should kill him before he...
- No!

514
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:59,421
Never hate your enemies.
It affects your judgment.

515
00:51:15,656 --> 00:51:18,273
Nice to see you again, Mr. Corleone.

516
00:51:38,596 --> 00:51:40,837
Hey, girls. Let's go.

517
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:03,242
We trusted you to manage
our money in the casinos.

518
00:52:03,329 --> 00:52:09,200
It's not even 20 years. You've sold the
casinos and made fortunes for all of us.

519
00:52:09,293 --> 00:52:11,455
Bravo, Don Corleone!

520
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:14,753
Thank you.

521
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:22,804
Friends, I have come here
because our business together is done.

522
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:26,216
We have prospered,

523
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:31,430
and now it is time for us to dissolve
the business relationship between us.

524
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:35,103
That's it.

525
00:52:35,194 --> 00:52:38,562
But I do have a little surprise. Al?

526
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,782
Your shares in the casinos.

527
00:52:44,453 --> 00:52:46,160
I thought I cut through
all the red tape,

528
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:48,453
so you could get your money right away.

529
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:57,163
50 million dollars!

530
00:52:57,257 --> 00:53:00,090
Not everybody gets the same.

531
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:01,177
Nothing for you...

532
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:03,093
It depends on your investment.

533
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,968
Michael, this is really generous!

534
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:08,257
Wonderful!

535
00:53:11,355 --> 00:53:16,020
- Parisi, how much did you invest?
- I don't remember.

536
00:53:16,819 --> 00:53:18,480
You're blessed.

537
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:28,240
My family has done much of
the hard work, taken many risks.

538
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:33,620
All to make money
for the rest of the families.

539
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:38,083
You all know Joey Zasa.

540
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:41,507
He is, I admit, an important man.

541
00:53:42,511 --> 00:53:46,254
His picture is on the cover
of the New York Times magazine.

542
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:50,800
He gets the Esquire Magazine award
for the best dressed gangster.

543
00:53:52,146 --> 00:53:54,012
The newspapers praise him

544
00:53:54,106 --> 00:53:58,646
because he hires Blacks,
which shows he has a good heart.

545
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:02,937
He is famous.

546
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:09,744
Who knows? Maybe one day
he'll make all of you popular.

547
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:12,738
It's true.

548
00:54:12,833 --> 00:54:18,454
I make more of a <i>bella figura.</i>
That is my nature.

549
00:54:18,547 --> 00:54:23,587
But I also want to make a move
into legitimate enterprises.

550
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:26,385
I'd like a little pin from the Pope.

551
00:54:26,889 --> 00:54:31,975
Sure, I take the Blacks
and the Spanish into my family,

552
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:35,428
because that's America.

553
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:39,974
And you guarantee
that they don't deal drugs?

554
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:46,106
I don't guarantee that. I guarantee
that I'll kill anybody who does.

555
00:54:50,746 --> 00:54:55,866
- Let me talk to him.
- Who can refuse Don Altobello?

556
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:58,708
- Joey, are you...
- No!

557
00:54:59,505 --> 00:55:04,841
I say to all of you, I have been
treated this day with no respect.

558
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:11,506
I've earned you all money. I've made
you rich and I asked for little.

559
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:15,434
Good. You will not give, so I'll take!

560
00:55:16,772 --> 00:55:19,264
As for Don Corleone,

561
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:25,320
he makes it very clear to me today
that he is my enemy.

562
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:31,525
You must choose between us.

563
00:55:35,082 --> 00:55:36,823
No, Joey!

564
00:55:36,917 --> 00:55:40,205
Michael, we could reason together.

565
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:41,660
No.

566
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:46,465
Michael, please... let's agree.

567
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:52,171
Michael, the news is everywhere.

568
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:57,226
Everyone says that
you control Immobiliare.

569
00:55:57,312 --> 00:56:02,432
Immobiliare is already laundering
money in Peru and Nassau.

570
00:56:03,652 --> 00:56:08,112
We've worked with you for 40 years.
We should wet our beaks a little.

571
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:13,113
- We want to do business with you.
- That's right, we've been together...

572
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:26,163
- It's a hit! Let's go!
- Let's get out of here! Move!

573
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:48,144
My coat! It's my lucky coat!

574
00:56:49,197 --> 00:56:50,562
It's my lucky coat!

575
00:56:57,205 --> 00:56:58,616
Stay behind me!

576
00:57:14,932 --> 00:57:16,673
Mikey, this way!

577
00:57:37,496 --> 00:57:39,578
Come on. We're out of here.

578
00:58:12,656 --> 00:58:14,988
- You did good, Vincent.
<i>- Grazie.</i>

579
00:58:15,367 --> 00:58:18,576
The old Dons were pretty much
wiped out.

580
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:21,828
The survivors made deals with Zasa.

581
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:25,578
- Altobello?
- He survived.

582
00:58:25,669 --> 00:58:28,502
He's with his daughters
in Staten Island.

583
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:30,704
He says he's going to retire in Sicily.

584
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:37,003
Joey Zasa would never pull something
like this without the backing.

585
00:58:37,848 --> 00:58:43,514
He's just muscle. He doesn't have
the wit for that helicopter attack.

586
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:47,972
He doesn't even have the ambition
to wipe out the whole Commission.

587
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:50,933
I say we hit back and take Zasa out!

588
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:59,449
Never let anyone know
what you're thinking.

589
00:59:07,419 --> 00:59:10,411
Let's get a message to Joey Zasa.

590
00:59:13,592 --> 00:59:15,924
I respect what he's done.

591
00:59:17,054 --> 00:59:19,967
The new overthrows the old.
It's natural.

592
00:59:20,432 --> 00:59:21,952
How can you do business with this guy?

593
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:29,639
I'm a businessman, first and foremost.
I want no further conflict.

594
00:59:29,733 --> 00:59:32,316
Tell him that he can live or he can die.

595
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:34,313
Vincent, will you shut up!

596
00:59:52,506 --> 00:59:53,996
That's it.

597
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:57,791
Joey Zasa...

598
00:59:58,470 --> 01:00:00,882
He can't be doing this alone.

599
01:00:04,643 --> 01:00:08,602
Just when I thought I was out,
they pull me back in.

600
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:23,026
Our true enemy has not yet
shown his face.

601
01:00:27,374 --> 01:00:28,660
Michael!

602
01:00:32,254 --> 01:00:34,086
It's his diabetes!

603
01:00:35,507 --> 01:00:39,045
- Has he had his medicine?
- I don't know what he took.

604
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:46,515
- I've got my wind back.
- Call a doctor.

605
01:00:46,601 --> 01:00:49,013
- Run, run, run!
- Vincent!

606
01:00:49,104 --> 01:00:52,597
Run at thunder, girl!
Thunder can't hurt!

607
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:55,106
Harmless noise!

608
01:00:55,861 --> 01:01:00,697
Bullshit! You deceitful old fuck!

609
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:04,028
Altobello, you fuck!

610
01:01:06,872 --> 01:01:08,112
Fredo!

611
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:10,698
Fredo!

612
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:36,815
Oh, God! Dad!

613
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:41,065
Excuse me.

614
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:43,272
I'll call Kay.

615
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:57,669
- Good evening, sir.
- Can we wait here? We'll be back soon.

616
01:02:04,471 --> 01:02:10,387
Mr. Harrison, you said it was urgent.
Have you come to confess your sins?

617
01:02:11,186 --> 01:02:15,851
Michael Corleone has had a diabetic
stroke. I wanted you to know about it.

618
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:21,394
He's in a coma. I'm here to insist
the deal goes through in any event.

619
01:02:21,488 --> 01:02:23,604
The Pope has not much time left.

620
01:02:25,325 --> 01:02:28,989
So, as you,
I am in a difficult position.

621
01:02:29,454 --> 01:02:32,446
We have to ratify this deal
as soon as possible.

622
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:36,374
- We have an understanding.
- Good.

623
01:02:37,796 --> 01:02:41,380
- I'm going to the hospital.
- I'll pray for Mr. Corleone.

624
01:02:46,137 --> 01:02:49,880
- Our thoughts are with Mr. Corleone.
- Thank you, Father Jim.

625
01:02:52,519 --> 01:02:56,137
Everything will be out in the open
if Corleone dies.

626
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:59,814
Play for time, Keinszig.

627
01:03:00,527 --> 01:03:04,942
A habit born of
a long contemplation of eternity.

628
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:43,142
Hello, Michael.

629
01:03:46,448 --> 01:03:47,779
It's Kay.

630
01:03:53,121 --> 01:03:54,327
Kay...

631
01:03:56,708 --> 01:03:58,699
I never expected you.

632
01:03:59,753 --> 01:04:01,915
No, I know.

633
01:04:04,341 --> 01:04:06,048
But I'm here.

634
01:04:10,013 --> 01:04:11,970
- I'm glad.
- You know...

635
01:04:15,477 --> 01:04:17,969
I've never seen you looking so helpless.

636
01:04:22,484 --> 01:04:24,566
It's not so bad, really.

637
01:04:26,654 --> 01:04:30,943
I feel... I'm getting wiser now.

638
01:04:31,034 --> 01:04:33,025
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

639
01:04:34,371 --> 01:04:40,037
- The sicker you get, the wiser you get?
- When I'm dead, I'll be really smart.

640
01:04:41,669 --> 01:04:46,004
Michael... I want to thank you for Tony.

641
01:04:49,052 --> 01:04:53,011
He's doing really well.
He's gotten some very good notices,

642
01:04:53,515 --> 01:04:58,806
and he'll make his operatic debut
in Sicily, in Palermo this Easter, so...

643
01:05:00,814 --> 01:05:02,145
So, thank you.

644
01:05:03,566 --> 01:05:06,684
That's a real honor. In Sicily.

645
01:05:11,699 --> 01:05:14,691
I will be there. I won't miss that.

646
01:05:15,537 --> 01:05:17,369
I won't miss that.

647
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:25,957
Mary, Tony...

648
01:05:27,257 --> 01:05:28,793
Go see Dad.

649
01:05:35,056 --> 01:05:38,265
- Sweetheart!
- Everything's going to be all right.

650
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:41,267
- Tony!
- How are you doing, Pop?

651
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:47,353
Your mother told me what happened.

652
01:05:47,444 --> 01:05:52,610
- About Palermo? I hope you'll be there.
- Of course. Kiss me.

653
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:18,047
- <i>Cousin Vinnie?</i>
- He's not here. Call his apartment.

654
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:21,512
- It's your cousin Mary.
- Let her in.

655
01:06:26,274 --> 01:06:30,484
Hi, cous. I thought I'd drop by.
Is that okay?

656
01:06:30,570 --> 01:06:32,436
I'll get the guys.

657
01:06:34,407 --> 01:06:37,616
No, it's not okay.
You shouldn't have come, Mary.

658
01:06:38,953 --> 01:06:41,320
Only a couple of minutes, okay?

659
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:45,782
- You look beautiful, cous.
- Thanks.

660
01:06:48,755 --> 01:06:51,338
So this is your club, your hideout?

661
01:06:52,175 --> 01:06:54,837
- Yeah.
- I came here to check it out.

662
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:03,843
It's so strange, just me
and Aunt Connie in the house.

663
01:07:03,937 --> 01:07:08,397
- I feel better when I'm with you.
- What's wrong, sweetheart?

664
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:11,691
- I'm scared about my father.
- Don't be.

665
01:07:11,778 --> 01:07:15,612
When they took him out of
the ambulance, I thought he was dead.

666
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:18,531
Everybody says he's going to be better.

667
01:07:20,537 --> 01:07:22,153
Don't worry.

668
01:07:22,664 --> 01:07:25,531
I remember a shooting when I was little.

669
01:07:26,543 --> 01:07:31,379
And one time Al Neri and other
bodyguards took me and Tony away.

670
01:07:33,383 --> 01:07:35,545
Is it all happening again?

671
01:07:37,136 --> 01:07:39,127
Not like that, sweetie.

672
01:07:40,682 --> 01:07:44,471
Then why are you hiding here?
Is something going to happen to you?

673
01:07:46,396 --> 01:07:50,390
Nothing's going to happen
to me, <i>cugina.</i> We'll take care of you.

674
01:08:01,703 --> 01:08:06,072
- Can I stay here and hide out with you?
- Can you help me cook for the boys?

675
01:08:06,165 --> 01:08:09,829
You know that I don't know
how to cook, but I'll help.

676
01:08:23,057 --> 01:08:24,297
Okay...

677
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:26,637
What do I do?

678
01:08:59,052 --> 01:09:01,965
- I love you, cous.
- I love you, too, cous.

679
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:07,344
Let us cook.

680
01:09:24,327 --> 01:09:25,658
Hold me.

681
01:10:02,532 --> 01:10:07,117
You in the press and the police
use words like "Mafia", "Cosa Nostra".

682
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:12,698
This is a fantasy. We Italian-Americans
laid the bricks that built this city.

683
01:10:12,792 --> 01:10:15,705
We have Meucci,
who invented the telephone.

684
01:10:15,795 --> 01:10:19,629
We have Don Ameche,
who played the guy who invented it.

685
01:10:20,299 --> 01:10:23,883
Buy yourself a raffle ticket,
maybe you'll win a Cadillac.

686
01:10:25,054 --> 01:10:27,546
The salsiccia is wonderful!

687
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:29,472
Here, have a sandwich.

688
01:10:42,655 --> 01:10:45,568
- Nice to see you, Mr. Zasa.
- Have a nice time.

689
01:10:47,326 --> 01:10:49,658
Don't forget to buy your raffle tickets.

690
01:10:53,124 --> 01:10:56,458
- What are you doing?
- He didn't mean it.

691
01:10:56,544 --> 01:10:58,911
- Tell him you're sorry.
- Okay, let's go.

692
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:20,982
Joey! How are you?

693
01:11:21,778 --> 01:11:23,689
How are you, Buddy boy?

694
01:11:24,906 --> 01:11:28,524
Hey, Joey Zasa! Joey, up your ass!

695
01:11:29,702 --> 01:11:32,615
- Who is this? Do you know him?
- Ignore him.

696
01:11:33,998 --> 01:11:36,535
Who's going to win the car? The Ant?

697
01:11:38,169 --> 01:11:42,504
This is what gives Italian-Americans
a bad name. A <i>cappone</i> like this.

698
01:11:42,590 --> 01:11:45,048
Joey, up your ass!

699
01:11:45,676 --> 01:11:48,134
Get off the car!
Do you have a raffle ticket?

700
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:52,047
Joey, take a look at my raffle ticket!

701
01:11:52,517 --> 01:11:56,761
Here's what I think of you...
and your raffle ticket.

702
01:11:57,396 --> 01:12:00,605
Get the fuck off this car.
I'll break your fucking balls.

703
01:12:03,945 --> 01:12:05,902
Get out of here!

704
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:22,911
Run, Joey! You piece of shit!

705
01:12:36,644 --> 01:12:38,510
Open the door!

706
01:12:38,604 --> 01:12:39,810
How are you, Joe?

707
01:12:43,734 --> 01:12:44,974
Zasa!

708
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:07,631
Don't ever again
give that kind of order.

709
01:13:07,717 --> 01:13:09,458
Not while I'm alive.

710
01:13:09,552 --> 01:13:10,917
Understand?

711
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:19,142
You were too sick to make a decision.
I got a go-ahead from Neri and Connie.

712
01:13:19,979 --> 01:13:21,185
Connie?

713
01:13:31,032 --> 01:13:33,774
It was the right decision, Uncle Mike.

714
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:38,278
It was the wrong decision.
I command this family!

715
01:13:38,831 --> 01:13:40,788
Right or wrong...

716
01:13:41,626 --> 01:13:44,368
it was not what I wanted!

717
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:04,721
Do you understand?

718
01:14:11,739 --> 01:14:12,900
Yes.

719
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:21,412
Come on, Michael.

720
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:34,375
Yes.

721
01:14:36,347 --> 01:14:40,056
Good. Vincent, help me to my bed.

722
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:42,509
I want to talk to you alone
for a minute.

723
01:14:50,778 --> 01:14:54,692
You know,
I always felt responsible for you.

724
01:14:55,658 --> 01:14:57,319
You know that.

725
01:14:58,285 --> 01:14:59,867
Your father...

726
01:15:00,955 --> 01:15:04,073
my brother, we were opposites.

727
01:15:04,625 --> 01:15:08,869
We would fight and argue.
But I never doubted his love.

728
01:15:09,797 --> 01:15:14,212
He would do anything for me.
But his temper...

729
01:15:17,763 --> 01:15:21,757
Too much. It clouded his reason.

730
01:15:23,269 --> 01:15:25,931
I don't want you to make that mistake.

731
01:15:28,816 --> 01:15:30,056
Also...

732
01:15:31,193 --> 01:15:33,730
he, too, had a way with women.

733
01:15:35,656 --> 01:15:38,239
- Vincent...
- So I hear.

734
01:15:38,325 --> 01:15:40,817
What are you doing with my daughter?

735
01:15:43,497 --> 01:15:45,204
What are you doing with her?

736
01:15:50,129 --> 01:15:51,995
It's too dangerous.

737
01:15:54,925 --> 01:15:56,586
Do you hear me?

738
01:16:02,933 --> 01:16:04,094
Okay.

739
01:16:18,741 --> 01:16:20,323
<i>Vincenzo...</i>

740
01:16:24,205 --> 01:16:28,119
When they come,
they'll come at what you love.

741
01:17:20,803 --> 01:17:22,259
How are you?

742
01:17:23,097 --> 01:17:25,930
Don Bendino, my old friend.

743
01:17:57,298 --> 01:17:59,084
I brought you here,

744
01:17:59,175 --> 01:18:02,964
so that my old friend and protector,
Don Tommasino,

745
01:18:03,053 --> 01:18:04,714
could advise us.

746
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:09,800
What do you think about Altobello?

747
01:18:10,769 --> 01:18:13,602
A very talented man.

748
01:18:14,023 --> 01:18:17,982
He has kept the peace between our
Sicilian and American friends.

749
01:18:19,028 --> 01:18:21,315
The saint of reason.

750
01:18:23,032 --> 01:18:26,866
A blood bath in Atlantic City
left New York a mess.

751
01:18:28,037 --> 01:18:30,620
Joey Zasa at least was running
a tight ship,

752
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:34,415
but with him out of the picture
we must step in.

753
01:18:34,501 --> 01:18:36,287
Step back in...

754
01:18:36,378 --> 01:18:39,040
Or the Chinese
and Colombians will.

755
01:18:39,423 --> 01:18:44,293
The Corleones left drugs, so
New York is weak, and Palermo is strong.

756
01:18:45,888 --> 01:18:49,927
Your enemies always get strong
on what you leave behind.

757
01:18:52,603 --> 01:18:57,018
Who could give the order
for that massacre...

758
01:18:58,859 --> 01:19:02,818
and still pressure the Vatican deal?

759
01:19:03,113 --> 01:19:08,233
Only Lucchesi can reach
between these two worlds.

760
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:13,579
"Our ships must all sail
in the same direction"...

761
01:19:15,209 --> 01:19:21,046
Italian politics have had these men
for centuries. They are the true Mafia.

762
01:19:21,131 --> 01:19:24,499
The Archbishop and the Vatican Bank,
that's the big problem.

763
01:19:24,593 --> 01:19:28,461
They're the same problem.
B.J., they're connected.

764
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:32,098
The Archbishop has powerful friends.

765
01:19:34,979 --> 01:19:36,561
They totally protect him.

766
01:19:37,022 --> 01:19:41,391
Is there someone in the
Church we can turn to?

767
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:45,148
Someone we can tell our problem to?

768
01:19:46,490 --> 01:19:48,481
Cardinal Lamberto.

769
01:19:48,742 --> 01:19:54,158
A wise and good man... very influential.

770
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:57,744
He will see you.

771
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:08,085
I will see this Cardinal Lamberto
and see if we can work things out.

772
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:14,549
You honor your agreements,
but you are dealing with crooks.

773
01:20:15,436 --> 01:20:17,427
They have no honor.

774
01:20:19,606 --> 01:20:21,313
My word is final.

775
01:20:32,619 --> 01:20:36,954
Politics and crime,
they're the same thing.

776
01:20:58,562 --> 01:21:05,150
I've invited you all here to celebrate
my son's debut in an opera house...

777
01:21:05,778 --> 01:21:07,564
We'll play "Philadelphia".

778
01:21:09,114 --> 01:21:13,108
Seven cards. Two down, four up.
Deuces and one-eyed jacks are wild.

779
01:21:13,202 --> 01:21:15,864
In the opera "Cavallaria Rusticana".

780
01:21:15,954 --> 01:21:20,414
- It's "Cavalleria Rusticana," Dad.
- "Cavalleria."

781
01:21:20,501 --> 01:21:23,118
I think I have tickets
to the wrong opera.

782
01:21:23,212 --> 01:21:25,169
I've been in New York too long.

783
01:21:26,131 --> 01:21:29,795
You will all receive tickets,
so come on time.

784
01:21:29,885 --> 01:21:31,421
Dad, I've got a present for you.

785
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:39,976
It comes from the town of Corleone
and it's authentic Sicilian.

786
01:21:41,563 --> 01:21:44,521
And... I learnt it for you.

787
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:57,152
Burns the moon in the sky,
and I burn with love

788
01:21:58,205 --> 01:22:04,451
Fire that wastes away like my heart

789
01:22:05,462 --> 01:22:11,128
My soul cries in pain

790
01:22:12,469 --> 01:22:18,715
It has no peace,
what a terrible night

791
01:22:19,810 --> 01:22:26,056
Time passes, but day never comes

792
01:22:26,733 --> 01:22:33,230
There is never sun,
if she doesn't return

793
01:22:34,158 --> 01:22:40,404
Burns my earth and burns my heart

794
01:22:41,957 --> 01:22:48,203
She is thirsty for water,
and I am thirsty for love

795
01:22:49,256 --> 01:22:54,501
To whom can I sing my song

796
01:22:55,762 --> 01:23:03,762
If no one appears at the balcony.

797
01:23:14,198 --> 01:23:19,443
<i>She was wonderful, beautiful.
I loved her. And then she died.</i>

798
01:23:21,079 --> 01:23:25,994
My trusted bodyguard
planted a bomb in my car.

799
01:23:27,628 --> 01:23:29,835
She drove it before I did.

800
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:34,924
Why is such a beautiful country
so violent?

801
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:36,626
History.

802
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:41,305
Mom was telling me about when your
biggest worry was passing your exams.

803
01:23:41,391 --> 01:23:44,975
- Yes, it was then.
- I worry about you now.

804
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:50,140
Oh, Mary, you're such
a warm-hearted girl. You always were.

805
01:23:50,651 --> 01:23:54,315
- I love my family.
- Even your cousin Vincent?

806
01:23:58,283 --> 01:24:00,069
I really love him.

807
01:24:01,662 --> 01:24:04,825
- He's your first cousin.
- Then I love him first.

808
01:24:05,916 --> 01:24:08,658
Mary, you can't see him.

809
01:24:09,336 --> 01:24:11,543
Just don't see him anymore.

810
01:24:12,548 --> 01:24:16,041
He's right. It's too dangerous.

811
01:24:18,262 --> 01:24:21,971
Mary, you can't see him anymore.

812
01:24:22,057 --> 01:24:23,889
Not in that fashion.

813
01:24:26,311 --> 01:24:28,598
Please, promise me.

814
01:24:29,565 --> 01:24:30,565
No!

815
01:24:45,372 --> 01:24:47,989
<i>Bella cugina... Tesoro mio.</i>

816
01:24:59,553 --> 01:25:01,885
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah.

817
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:06,091
I want you to do something for me.
It's dangerous.

818
01:25:07,936 --> 01:25:11,270
Good. I'm in. What do you need?

819
01:25:12,024 --> 01:25:15,107
I want you to sell your soul
to Don Altobello.

820
01:25:15,861 --> 01:25:17,522
To betray me.

821
01:25:20,949 --> 01:25:22,940
He'd never believe me.

822
01:25:24,036 --> 01:25:26,403
- That depends.
- Sit down.

823
01:25:29,291 --> 01:25:30,873
<i>I have an idea.</i>

824
01:25:32,586 --> 01:25:35,954
See if you can learn
how high Altobello is connected.

825
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:42,046
Arrange a meeting.

826
01:25:44,723 --> 01:25:49,217
You say how devoted you are to me.
Tell him your problems.

827
01:25:50,312 --> 01:25:53,179
- Ask for his help.
- What problems?

828
01:25:55,192 --> 01:25:56,933
That you want to run away
with my daughter.

829
01:25:58,779 --> 01:26:02,317
But you know that if you do,
I will become your enemy.

830
01:26:07,579 --> 01:26:11,072
- You know that I would never do that.
- I know.

831
01:26:12,292 --> 01:26:16,786
<i>Ask Altobello to speak to me.
To further the marriage.</i>

832
01:26:17,464 --> 01:26:22,129
But you're cousins, after all. Michael
was always a little old-fashioned.

833
01:26:23,512 --> 01:26:28,507
Say you can't belong to my legitimate
world. That you want your own family.

834
01:26:29,184 --> 01:26:32,097
I could straighten out
what Joey Zasa left behind.

835
01:26:34,106 --> 01:26:36,643
If you could use your friendship
to persuade him,

836
01:26:38,068 --> 01:26:40,309
I would be indebted to you forever.

837
01:26:42,948 --> 01:26:46,612
A Corleone knows the value
of such a friend.

838
01:26:48,453 --> 01:26:50,865
Then you would work for me?

839
01:26:51,748 --> 01:26:52,954
<i>Sì.</i>

840
01:26:55,627 --> 01:26:57,959
<i>Bacio la mano, Don Altobello.</i>

841
01:27:01,341 --> 01:27:06,177
If he hints that he wants you
to betray me, get insulted,

842
01:27:06,888 --> 01:27:08,925
because that's his trap.

843
01:27:15,772 --> 01:27:18,935
You're not telling me
the whole truth, Vincenzo.

844
01:27:22,237 --> 01:27:27,949
Isn't it true, that with Michael gone,
the girl controls everything?

845
01:27:32,122 --> 01:27:35,786
- Leave the girl out of this.
- Of course, you love her.

846
01:27:35,876 --> 01:27:37,583
And she loves you.

847
01:27:55,395 --> 01:27:58,228
I guessed it, didn't I?

848
01:28:00,025 --> 01:28:04,815
You're a wise man, Don Altobello.
I'll be learning a lot from you.

849
01:28:05,822 --> 01:28:08,439
The richest man is the one
with the most powerful friends.

850
01:28:11,953 --> 01:28:14,365
It's my duty to make the introductions.

851
01:28:21,630 --> 01:28:23,166
Don Lucchesi.

852
01:28:26,259 --> 01:28:31,971
Don Altobello tells me that you have
a strong character. A man of respect.

853
01:28:32,057 --> 01:28:35,391
This is the hero who put
Joey Zasa in his grave.

854
01:28:35,936 --> 01:28:39,804
If we'd known of his existence,
we wouldn't have backed Joey.

855
01:28:40,190 --> 01:28:42,272
No one wants another Joe.

856
01:28:44,277 --> 01:28:45,438
Let me be your friend.

857
01:28:47,030 --> 01:28:51,149
- Even the strongest man needs friends.
- I'm flattered.

858
01:28:52,619 --> 01:28:57,113
You're a man of finance and politics.
Things I don't understand.

859
01:28:58,917 --> 01:29:02,785
You understand guns.
Finance is a gun.

860
01:29:03,964 --> 01:29:07,958
Politics is knowing
when to pull the trigger.

861
01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:13,720
How can I help?

862
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:16,465
<i>Vieni?</i>

863
01:29:21,523 --> 01:29:25,016
I trusted this business
arrangement with the Archbishop.

864
01:29:25,110 --> 01:29:26,225
I trusted him.

865
01:29:26,319 --> 01:29:29,562
I was sure his honesty
was beyond a doubt.

866
01:29:30,532 --> 01:29:34,776
But, as you see,
I'm now the victim of a swindle.

867
01:29:35,787 --> 01:29:41,408
He's stalling me. Vast monies have
gone to people in high political places

868
01:29:41,751 --> 01:29:44,584
and the Vatican Bank is the guarantor.

869
01:29:44,671 --> 01:29:49,962
If what you say is true,
there will be a great scandal.

870
01:29:52,053 --> 01:29:57,093
Look at this stone. It has been
in the water for a very long time,

871
01:29:57,183 --> 01:30:00,926
but the water has not penetrated it.

872
01:30:05,150 --> 01:30:06,390
Look...

873
01:30:07,527 --> 01:30:12,613
Perfectly dry. The same thing
has happened to men in Europe.

874
01:30:12,699 --> 01:30:16,909
For centuries they have been
surrounded by Christianity,

875
01:30:17,746 --> 01:30:23,583
but Christ has not penetrated.
Christ doesn't live within them.

876
01:30:27,714 --> 01:30:31,878
- What's happening?
- Could you get me something sweet?

877
01:30:31,968 --> 01:30:35,302
Some orange juice, candy...

878
01:30:39,017 --> 01:30:40,928
I have trouble with diabetes.

879
01:30:45,023 --> 01:30:47,355
My blood sugar goes low.

880
01:30:47,442 --> 01:30:49,183
I understand.

881
01:31:12,425 --> 01:31:14,917
It happens sometimes
when I'm under stress.

882
01:31:16,304 --> 01:31:17,886
I understand.

883
01:31:19,891 --> 01:31:23,600
To come to you
on such a delicate matter...

884
01:31:26,606 --> 01:31:31,271
Accusations against your Archbishop.
It was difficult for me.

885
01:31:32,904 --> 01:31:34,645
The mind suffers

886
01:31:35,115 --> 01:31:37,982
and the body cries out.

887
01:31:44,124 --> 01:31:45,614
That's true.

888
01:31:47,293 --> 01:31:51,127
Would you like to make
your confession?

889
01:31:58,013 --> 01:31:59,879
Your Eminence, I'm...

890
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:09,430
It's been so long. I wouldn't...
I wouldn't know where to...

891
01:32:11,026 --> 01:32:12,858
It's been 30 years.

892
01:32:14,779 --> 01:32:17,612
I'd use up too much of your time,
I think.

893
01:32:18,408 --> 01:32:20,866
I always have time to save souls.

894
01:32:22,412 --> 01:32:27,031
- Well, I'm beyond redemption.
- No, no...

895
01:32:36,593 --> 01:32:40,302
I hear the confessions
of my own priests here.

896
01:32:41,639 --> 01:32:45,177
Sometimes the desire to confess
is overwhelming,

897
01:32:45,894 --> 01:32:48,261
and we must seize the moment.

898
01:32:52,901 --> 01:32:56,565
What is the point of confessing
if I don't repent?

899
01:32:59,157 --> 01:33:01,569
I hear you are a practical man.

900
01:33:02,535 --> 01:33:04,572
What have you got to lose?

901
01:33:16,466 --> 01:33:17,831
Go on.

902
01:33:23,765 --> 01:33:29,017
I... betrayed my wife.

903
01:33:30,814 --> 01:33:32,350
Go on, my son.

904
01:33:38,029 --> 01:33:39,770
I betrayed myself.

905
01:33:42,742 --> 01:33:44,232
I killed men.

906
01:33:48,498 --> 01:33:50,910
And I ordered men to be killed.

907
01:33:52,460 --> 01:33:54,576
Go on, my son. Go on.

908
01:34:00,426 --> 01:34:01,791
It's useless.

909
01:34:03,847 --> 01:34:05,508
Go on, my son.

910
01:34:06,933 --> 01:34:08,389
I killed...

911
01:34:13,523 --> 01:34:15,685
I ordered the death of my brother.

912
01:34:17,152 --> 01:34:18,938
He injured me.

913
01:34:20,572 --> 01:34:22,609
I killed my mother's son.

914
01:34:24,492 --> 01:34:26,529
I killed my father's son.

915
01:34:37,297 --> 01:34:41,712
Your sins are terrible,
and it is just that you suffer.

916
01:34:43,303 --> 01:34:45,715
Your life could be redeemed,

917
01:34:47,098 --> 01:34:50,932
but I know that you don't believe that.
You will not change.

918
01:35:16,169 --> 01:35:22,757
<i>Pope Paul VI, Supreme Pontiff
of the Roman Catholic Church,...</i>

919
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:26,923
<i>died last night at 9:40 p.m.</i>

920
01:35:27,722 --> 01:35:31,135
<i>The Pope was 81 years old,...</i>

921
01:35:32,143 --> 01:35:35,636
<i>and had been in poor health
for the last several months.</i>

922
01:35:43,196 --> 01:35:44,561
Connie...

923
01:35:46,366 --> 01:35:50,781
All my life I've kept trying
to go up in society.

924
01:35:51,454 --> 01:35:54,367
To where everything higher up
was legal, straight...

925
01:35:56,459 --> 01:35:59,952
But the higher I go,
the more crooked it becomes.

926
01:36:02,590 --> 01:36:04,752
Where the hell does it end?

927
01:36:13,935 --> 01:36:16,677
They've been killing each other
for centuries here.

928
01:36:18,773 --> 01:36:22,858
For money, for pride, for family.

929
01:36:26,072 --> 01:36:30,111
To keep from becoming the slaves
of the rich <i>pezzi da novanta.</i>

930
01:36:37,166 --> 01:36:39,407
I made confession, Connie.

931
01:36:40,420 --> 01:36:42,502
I confessed my sins.

932
01:36:44,132 --> 01:36:49,218
Why? That's not like you. You don't
have to confess your sins to a stranger.

933
01:36:50,179 --> 01:36:51,590
It was the man.

934
01:36:52,765 --> 01:36:56,474
He's a good man. A true priest.

935
01:37:00,648 --> 01:37:02,639
He can change things.

936
01:37:04,944 --> 01:37:06,400
Michael...

937
01:37:08,156 --> 01:37:12,070
You know,
sometimes I think of poor Fredo.

938
01:37:12,869 --> 01:37:16,157
Drowned. It was God's will.

939
01:37:18,708 --> 01:37:20,619
It was a terrible accident.

940
01:37:22,253 --> 01:37:23,994
But it's finished.

941
01:37:29,260 --> 01:37:31,092
Michael, I love you.

942
01:37:33,556 --> 01:37:35,297
I'll always help you.

943
01:37:47,779 --> 01:37:49,315
Oh, Connie...

944
01:38:19,227 --> 01:38:26,770
I am honored, Don Altobello,
that you've come from Palermo to visit me.

945
01:38:29,570 --> 01:38:34,610
Hey, the little kid! He's grown.

946
01:38:35,243 --> 01:38:36,984
Do the donkey for me.

947
01:38:54,595 --> 01:38:58,680
It's been some time since we
did business together.

948
01:39:02,645 --> 01:39:07,731
You are my "ace in the hole,"
as we say in America.

949
01:39:07,817 --> 01:39:13,608
I wave a stone in my shoe.
You can remove it.

950
01:39:20,872 --> 01:39:23,079
Only one stone?

951
01:39:35,845 --> 01:39:37,461
Kay!

952
01:39:37,555 --> 01:39:39,842
- Connie!
- How are you?

953
01:39:39,932 --> 01:39:42,970
Mary, I've missed you.

954
01:39:43,644 --> 01:39:47,387
- Hello, Michael.
- Mom, look at this.

955
01:39:51,444 --> 01:39:57,440
- It's too bad Douglas couldn't come.
- I know. He had a very important trial.

956
01:39:57,533 --> 01:39:59,319
I know he wanted to come.

957
01:40:00,495 --> 01:40:02,532
- The car is...
- Okay.

958
01:40:04,499 --> 01:40:10,996
- Well, your son is an artist.
- Oh, yes. Thanks to you.

959
01:40:11,339 --> 01:40:15,799
- What for?
- For making me let him go.

960
01:40:16,302 --> 01:40:21,547
Well, after all these years,
here I am in Sicily for the first time.

961
01:40:21,641 --> 01:40:23,598
I want to get a picture of you together.

962
01:40:23,684 --> 01:40:24,765
Okay.

963
01:40:26,812 --> 01:40:28,519
Hey, Dad. Smile!

964
01:40:33,110 --> 01:40:35,898
I see you still have Al Neri. Why?

965
01:40:37,031 --> 01:40:40,524
I need him. He helps me
get in and out of the car.

966
01:40:42,078 --> 01:40:45,662
- He carries my briefcase.
- You're still a liar, Michael.

967
01:40:46,832 --> 01:40:52,703
Let me show you Sicily, the real Sicily.
So you'll understand the family history.

968
01:40:53,172 --> 01:40:56,005
I think I understand
it well enough.

969
01:41:47,977 --> 01:41:53,768
Anthony, I have something you made
for me a very long time ago.

970
01:41:55,526 --> 01:41:58,268
- Might bring you luck.
- Thanks.

971
01:42:02,575 --> 01:42:05,693
You saved it... I remember.

972
01:42:09,749 --> 01:42:11,285
Thank you, Dad.

973
01:42:13,127 --> 01:42:14,788
I'm proud of you.

974
01:42:15,421 --> 01:42:16,957
Thank you.

975
01:42:33,272 --> 01:42:36,105
- Are they as good as they look?
- Better.

976
01:42:36,192 --> 01:42:41,062
They're the best. As long as they are
around, Uncle Michael is safe.

977
01:42:41,405 --> 01:42:42,816
Goodbye.

978
01:42:45,451 --> 01:42:47,237
Tell your father
I'll be back for dinner.

979
01:42:47,328 --> 01:42:48,659
Okay.

980
01:42:49,163 --> 01:42:51,996
- Have fun.
- Tell Tony to wait for me.

981
01:42:52,083 --> 01:42:53,323
I will.

982
01:42:55,836 --> 01:42:59,420
<i>Buongiorno, Signora.</i> At your service.

983
01:43:03,386 --> 01:43:06,253
If I see Dad, I'll tell him you left.

984
01:43:11,686 --> 01:43:15,645
You're the only one left
with my father's strength.

985
01:43:17,650 --> 01:43:21,268
If anything happens to Michael,
I want you to strike back.

986
01:43:24,532 --> 01:43:26,569
I'll have everything ready.

987
01:43:30,287 --> 01:43:31,698
Do you swear?

988
01:43:39,213 --> 01:43:40,795
I swear to you.

989
01:44:05,281 --> 01:44:06,737
Here it is.

990
01:44:08,659 --> 01:44:10,866
The house where my father was born.

991
01:44:12,371 --> 01:44:17,787
This is where they came to take him
when he was a boy. To kill him.

992
01:44:20,963 --> 01:44:22,374
Wait...

993
01:44:23,466 --> 01:44:24,831
Listen to that.

994
01:44:44,612 --> 01:44:46,319
You know Mary's in love.

995
01:44:48,115 --> 01:44:49,571
Yes, I know.

996
01:44:50,910 --> 01:44:54,744
With a handsome young Italian man
with dark eyes...

997
01:44:56,248 --> 01:44:57,784
I won't allow it.

998
01:45:00,795 --> 01:45:04,459
It's wrong.
It's wrong and it's dangerous.

999
01:45:04,673 --> 01:45:07,540
"Oh father, my father!"

1000
01:45:08,219 --> 01:45:10,586
"Give me some time to pray
to the Lord."

1001
01:45:11,764 --> 01:45:14,722
The Baroness of Carini had
betrayed her husband...

1002
01:45:15,392 --> 01:45:18,180
and fallen in love with her cousin.

1003
01:45:18,521 --> 01:45:20,512
"There will be no forgiveness!"

1004
01:45:20,856 --> 01:45:24,474
Her father stabbed her
through the heart.

1005
01:45:36,872 --> 01:45:38,362
Honor, huh?

1006
01:45:58,018 --> 01:46:01,101
I remember the time you came
to my parents' house

1007
01:46:01,188 --> 01:46:04,681
and told me about the family business.

1008
01:46:04,775 --> 01:46:09,815
How you'd never have anything
to do with it. You sounded like Tony.

1009
01:46:10,865 --> 01:46:12,856
I was a lot like Tony.

1010
01:46:20,499 --> 01:46:23,332
- I can barely see him... Kay?
- What?

1011
01:46:23,419 --> 01:46:26,081
- Do you mind driving?
- What's wrong?

1012
01:46:26,171 --> 01:46:29,129
My eyes.
Sometimes they're all right, but...

1013
01:46:30,885 --> 01:46:32,626
I have to see Don Tommasino...

1014
01:46:36,974 --> 01:46:38,305
Well...

1015
01:46:39,560 --> 01:46:42,894
- There are no bodyguards today.
- I really snuck away.

1016
01:46:49,987 --> 01:46:54,402
Father, where are you going?
Would you like a ride?

1017
01:47:03,500 --> 01:47:07,744
I know you. You're Mosca
of Montelepre.

1018
01:47:09,298 --> 01:47:12,711
You were an assassin then,
and you're an assassin now.

1019
01:47:13,052 --> 01:47:16,295
I know Michael Corleone
is at your house.

1020
01:47:16,639 --> 01:47:18,926
I will pass through the gates with you.

1021
01:47:35,950 --> 01:47:37,691
How are you?

1022
01:47:37,785 --> 01:47:41,403
This is Calo, one of my bodyguards
in the old days.

1023
01:47:47,211 --> 01:47:49,828
- We can wait here.
- You want a drink?

1024
01:47:55,260 --> 01:47:58,127
I spent a lot of time in this room...

1025
01:47:59,223 --> 01:48:01,180
thinking of you.

1026
01:48:04,311 --> 01:48:05,972
And then you got married.

1027
01:48:10,109 --> 01:48:13,477
- I still thought of you.
- What's in that room?

1028
01:48:18,283 --> 01:48:21,776
This is dangerous for you.
This is Sicily.

1029
01:48:24,957 --> 01:48:27,289
- I love this country.
- Why?

1030
01:48:29,837 --> 01:48:35,674
Well, all through history, terrible
things have happened to these people.

1031
01:48:36,760 --> 01:48:38,626
Terrible injustices.

1032
01:48:39,888 --> 01:48:44,928
But they still expect good,
rather than had, will happen to them.

1033
01:48:45,310 --> 01:48:47,301
Sort of like me and you?

1034
01:48:51,567 --> 01:48:54,184
- How so?
- I'm still here, right?

1035
01:48:55,195 --> 01:48:58,233
We do have a bad history,
but I'm still here.

1036
01:48:58,323 --> 01:49:00,815
Yes, you are, but with dread.

1037
01:49:06,040 --> 01:49:07,496
Give me the order!

1038
01:49:08,167 --> 01:49:10,374
Is that supposed to make me
not dread you?

1039
01:49:13,505 --> 01:49:15,496
We're in Sicily. It's opera.

1040
01:49:18,343 --> 01:49:19,583
Okay.

1041
01:49:22,431 --> 01:49:23,842
What do we do now?

1042
01:49:26,935 --> 01:49:30,849
Be reasonable.
Let's try not to hurt each other.

1043
01:49:38,655 --> 01:49:40,737
I want you to forgive me.

1044
01:49:43,535 --> 01:49:46,493
- For what?
- Everything.

1045
01:49:50,209 --> 01:49:52,325
Oh, like God?

1046
01:49:54,171 --> 01:49:56,754
No, I need something a little closer.

1047
01:49:59,676 --> 01:50:02,634
You couldn't understand,
back in those days.

1048
01:50:04,348 --> 01:50:09,218
I loved my father. I swore I would
never be a man like him,

1049
01:50:09,311 --> 01:50:13,145
but I loved him and he was in danger.
What could I do?

1050
01:50:13,816 --> 01:50:16,558
And then later, you were in danger.

1051
01:50:17,444 --> 01:50:20,436
Our children were in danger.
What could I do?

1052
01:50:21,782 --> 01:50:27,073
You were all that I...
loved and valued most in the world.

1053
01:50:29,289 --> 01:50:31,496
Now I'm losing you. I lost you.

1054
01:50:32,793 --> 01:50:34,079
You're gone.

1055
01:50:35,879 --> 01:50:38,712
And it was all for nothing. So...

1056
01:50:43,387 --> 01:50:48,473
You have to understand,
I had a whole different destiny planned.

1057
01:50:52,062 --> 01:50:53,552
All right, I'll stop.

1058
01:51:04,449 --> 01:51:08,158
I really don't know what you
want from me, Michael.

1059
01:51:08,829 --> 01:51:13,369
- I mean...
- I'm not the man that you think I am.

1060
01:51:14,793 --> 01:51:18,081
- I don't know.
- I love you, Kay.

1061
01:51:20,174 --> 01:51:22,256
Don't dread me anymore.

1062
01:51:27,890 --> 01:51:31,758
You know, every night here in Sicily...

1063
01:51:33,979 --> 01:51:38,974
I dream about my wife
and my children...

1064
01:51:42,487 --> 01:51:44,444
and how I lost them.

1065
01:51:46,658 --> 01:51:52,370
I guess that if it's any consolation,
I want you to know that...

1066
01:51:55,709 --> 01:51:57,291
that...

1067
01:51:58,295 --> 01:52:00,286
I always loved you, Michael.

1068
01:52:02,132 --> 01:52:03,622
And you know...

1069
01:52:05,719 --> 01:52:08,336
always, I always will.

1070
01:52:36,625 --> 01:52:38,912
What is it? What's wrong?

1071
01:52:39,378 --> 01:52:42,086
They found Don Tommasino shot.

1072
01:52:43,298 --> 01:52:45,505
Is he dead?

1073
01:52:47,344 --> 01:52:50,803
My master is dead.
Blood calls for blood.

1074
01:52:51,390 --> 01:52:54,257
I must have revenge!

1075
01:52:58,063 --> 01:53:03,274
Some day, you may have to do
a difficult service for me.

1076
01:53:03,568 --> 01:53:05,058
Command me.

1077
01:53:07,030 --> 01:53:08,111
It never ends.

1078
01:53:08,198 --> 01:53:10,405
I will avenge him!

1079
01:53:25,549 --> 01:53:27,039
Totals...

1080
01:53:29,136 --> 01:53:31,468
Lorscheider, 1 vote.

1081
01:53:32,264 --> 01:53:35,097
Siri, 11 votes.

1082

Lamberto, 99 votes.

1083
01:53:44,526 --> 01:53:49,737
Do you accept your election
as supreme pontiff?

1084
01:53:50,365 --> 01:53:56,281
Oh, God, shed light on
the decision they have taken on my behalf.

1085
01:53:57,122 --> 01:53:58,738
I accept.

1086
01:53:58,999 --> 01:54:01,491
By what name
do you wish to be called?

1087
01:54:01,960 --> 01:54:04,873
John Paul the First.

1088
01:54:34,534 --> 01:54:39,370
I will do things "right away,"
rather than in "a little while"...

1089
01:54:41,500 --> 01:54:44,868
<i>Frederick Keinszig,
known as "God's Banker",</i>

1090
01:54:44,961 --> 01:54:46,827
<i>has been reported missing.</i>

1091
01:54:46,922 --> 01:54:53,635
<i>He was last seen leaving the Rome
offices of Vatican owned Immobiliare.</i>

1092
01:54:54,471 --> 01:54:57,930
<i>Also missing was a large sum
of money and several documents.</i>

1093
01:54:59,434 --> 01:55:01,471
Keinszig, you fool.

1094
01:55:05,065 --> 01:55:07,648
<i>His absence
casts further suspicion</i>

1095
01:55:07,734 --> 01:55:09,975
<i>on the dealings of the Vatican Bank.</i>

1096
01:55:10,070 --> 01:55:12,778
<i>For several years,
the bank and its companies</i>

1097
01:55:12,864 --> 01:55:17,108
<i>have been the object of allegations
of disreputable business practices.</i>

1098
01:55:18,245 --> 01:55:22,364
Lucchesi, will you please
try to understand?

1099
01:55:23,875 --> 01:55:28,164
I have phoned him.
I have waited here by the phone.

1100
01:55:30,799 --> 01:55:34,292
<i>You would do well to remember,
Mr. Lucchesi,</i>

1101
01:55:35,470 --> 01:55:42,058
that this Pope has very different ideas
from the last one.

1102
01:55:54,865 --> 01:55:56,856
Goodbye, my old friend.

1103
01:56:06,793 --> 01:56:08,454
I swear,

1104
01:56:08,962 --> 01:56:11,169
on the lives of my children...

1105
01:56:15,760 --> 01:56:18,422
Give me a chance to redeem myself...

1106
01:56:22,392 --> 01:56:26,010
and I will sin no more.

1107
01:56:51,463 --> 01:56:53,579
It's not just a bad banking deal.

1108
01:56:54,966 --> 01:56:56,582
These guys are butchers.

1109
01:56:58,178 --> 01:57:00,920
- What guys?
- Lucchesi.

1110
01:57:02,766 --> 01:57:06,680
He controls all of them:
Altobello, the Archbishop...

1111
01:57:08,438 --> 01:57:11,146
others higher up, P2 maybe.

1112
01:57:11,233 --> 01:57:14,225
Secret unknown. They're running things.

1113
01:57:18,073 --> 01:57:22,909
- I'm in their way.
- He's hired an assassin to kill you.

1114
01:57:23,411 --> 01:57:26,028
A Sicilian. I don't know his name.

1115
01:57:28,208 --> 01:57:29,869
But they say he never fails.

1116
01:57:31,670 --> 01:57:33,286
Then no one is safe.

1117
01:57:36,633 --> 01:57:39,000
Even the new Pope is in danger.

1118
01:57:40,095 --> 01:57:43,178
We still have time. We can prevent this.

1119
01:57:48,603 --> 01:57:50,935
I tried, Vincent.

1120
01:57:53,108 --> 01:57:54,598
I tried...

1121
01:57:55,944 --> 01:58:00,313
to keep everything from coming
to this. But it's not possible.

1122
01:58:01,908 --> 01:58:03,615
Not in this world.

1123
01:58:05,245 --> 01:58:06,952
Give me the order.

1124
01:58:10,834 --> 01:58:12,700
You won't be able to go back.

1125
01:58:14,087 --> 01:58:16,328
- You'll be like me.
- Good.

1126
01:58:18,049 --> 01:58:20,131
All my life I wanted out.

1127
01:58:20,760 --> 01:58:22,797
I wanted the family out.

1128
01:58:24,931 --> 01:58:26,592
I don't want out.

1129
01:58:27,225 --> 01:58:29,557
I want the power to preserve the family.

1130
01:58:34,733 --> 01:58:36,690
I'm asking for the order.

1131
01:58:53,710 --> 01:58:55,747
I can't do it anymore.

1132
01:58:59,549 --> 01:59:03,713
Well, it doesn't matter.
Vincent knows what to do.

1133
01:59:03,803 --> 01:59:08,764
Come on outside.
Take a rest and don't think about it.

1134
01:59:08,850 --> 01:59:11,638
- All I do is think about it.
- I'm your son.

1135
01:59:12,979 --> 01:59:14,720
Command me in all things.

1136
01:59:17,609 --> 01:59:19,191
Give up my daughter.

1137
01:59:22,405 --> 01:59:24,191
That's the price you pay...

1138
01:59:25,825 --> 01:59:27,657
for the life you choose.

1139
01:59:54,104 --> 01:59:55,435
Nephew...

1140
01:59:58,024 --> 01:59:59,890
from this moment on...

1141
02:00:01,945 --> 02:00:03,902
call yourself Vincent Corleone.

1142
02:00:08,910 --> 02:00:10,196
Sit.

1143
02:00:25,343 --> 02:00:26,879
Don Vincenzo...

1144
02:00:33,143 --> 02:00:34,554
Don Corleone...

1145
02:00:38,356 --> 02:00:40,142
Don Vincenzo Corleone...

1146
02:02:14,244 --> 02:02:16,576
<i>E tu, Vincenzo...</i>

1147
02:02:16,663 --> 02:02:21,499
I know how you feel about Michael,
but you can't save him.

1148
02:02:22,252 --> 02:02:23,617
He's lost.

1149
02:02:25,171 --> 02:02:26,753
Think of yourself.

1150
02:02:28,091 --> 02:02:30,924
What's your answer, Vincent?

1151
02:02:32,428 --> 02:02:34,169
Enjoy the opera.

1152
02:02:36,266 --> 02:02:38,257
It's all taken care of.

1153
02:02:43,898 --> 02:02:46,014
Check the bar. I'll check the top floor.

1154
02:02:50,530 --> 02:02:54,865
"Here's hoping Tony sings better at
the Teatro Massimo than in the shower.

1155
02:02:54,951 --> 02:02:56,567
"Love, Douglas."

1156
02:02:57,287 --> 02:03:00,746
- My darling Constanza!
- Don Altobello.

1157
02:03:01,666 --> 02:03:04,704
- This is a great occasion.
- Come, sit down.

1158
02:03:09,382 --> 02:03:13,922
Happy birthday.
You're 80, but don't look more than 60.

1159
02:03:14,012 --> 02:03:16,379
You're the only one who remembered.

1160
02:03:16,472 --> 02:03:18,133
We've just got the word.

1161
02:03:18,224 --> 02:03:21,683
The Pope has ratified
the Immobiliare deal. We've won.

1162
02:03:21,769 --> 02:03:23,180
Congratulations.

1163
02:03:26,274 --> 02:03:28,515
Strange how things work.

1164
02:03:28,610 --> 02:03:32,103
The Pope is doing what you said
he'd do. He's cleaning house.

1165
02:03:33,740 --> 02:03:37,529
He should be careful.
It's dangerous to be an honest man.

1166
02:03:43,583 --> 02:03:46,871
I want to put
more muscle backstage with Tony.

1167
02:03:58,681 --> 02:04:02,219
On your birthday
you used to shower me with treats.

1168
02:04:02,310 --> 02:04:03,800
Tootsie Rolls!

1169
02:04:05,021 --> 02:04:10,187
The nuns who made this cannoli took a
vow of silence. They're the very finest.

1170
02:04:14,322 --> 02:04:17,064
- Hey.
- Hey, cous.

1171
02:04:19,118 --> 02:04:22,031
Hi. Where's your leather?

1172
02:04:26,042 --> 02:04:27,282
Stop it.

1173
02:04:33,591 --> 02:04:37,004
You're so thin. You eat it.

1174
02:04:53,403 --> 02:04:54,609
<i>È buono.</i>

1175
02:04:55,279 --> 02:04:57,611
<i>Grazie!</i>

1176
02:05:00,535 --> 02:05:04,369
It's over. There are things I have to do
that you can't be part of.

1177
02:05:04,956 --> 02:05:07,869
It's not your father's decision,
it's mine.

1178
02:05:09,794 --> 02:05:11,330
Don't hate your father.

1179
02:05:14,132 --> 02:05:17,591
There are things I'll be part of
that you can't be around.

1180
02:05:19,721 --> 02:05:22,133
After tonight,
you won't see me anymore.

1181
02:05:26,811 --> 02:05:29,929
You've got to understand, Mary.
You've got to understand.

1182
02:05:31,482 --> 02:05:33,098
I'll always love you.

1183
02:05:46,330 --> 02:05:47,695
Love somebody else.

1184
02:09:29,262 --> 02:09:30,673
They won't try anything.

1185
02:09:30,763 --> 02:09:33,300
Everything's fine.
It's all clear.

1186
02:09:33,391 --> 02:09:35,883
I've already sent Al Neri
to the Vatican.

1187
02:09:48,489 --> 02:09:51,106
Mr. Lucchesi's house?

1188
02:09:51,200 --> 02:09:52,281
Yes.

1189
02:09:52,702 --> 02:09:56,912
I bring a message
from Michael Corleone.

1190
02:09:58,332 --> 02:09:59,663
Let him in.

1191
02:11:28,923 --> 02:11:30,505
<i>Buona sera.</i>

1192
02:14:51,875 --> 02:14:53,491
Good. You got him.

1193
02:15:45,888 --> 02:15:48,880
<i>Tonight the Corleone family
settles its accounts.</i>

1194
02:15:49,767 --> 02:15:54,352
<i>Keinszig...
That little Swiss banker fuck.</i>

1195
02:15:55,689 --> 02:15:59,398
<i>He's been swindling everyone
from the beginning. Fuck him.</i>

1196
02:16:01,111 --> 02:16:03,773
<i>Don Lucchesi, my friend.</i>

1197
02:16:03,864 --> 02:16:06,481
<i>Calo will pay him a visit at his home.</i>

1198
02:16:09,161 --> 02:16:12,654
<i>Neri, take a train to Rome.</i>

1199
02:16:14,083 --> 02:16:15,994
<i>Light a candle for the Archbishop.</i>

1200
02:16:51,078 --> 02:16:54,366
Tea, Your Holiness?
It will help you sleep.

1201
02:17:18,147 --> 02:17:21,139
This is from Vincent Corleone.

1202
02:18:19,458 --> 02:18:20,869
It's serious.

1203
02:18:20,959 --> 02:18:24,452
Our man inside the Vatican
says there's a plot against the Pope.

1204
02:18:24,546 --> 02:18:26,628
He'll have a heart attack?

1205
02:18:33,889 --> 02:18:39,100
This Pope has powerful enemies.
We may not be in time to save him.

1206
02:18:41,939 --> 02:18:43,429
Let's go back.

1207
02:19:10,425 --> 02:19:11,915
Your Holiness?

1208
02:19:18,350 --> 02:19:19,465
Eminence.

1209
02:19:35,409 --> 02:19:38,026
The Holy Father is dead!

1210
02:21:08,335 --> 02:21:09,416
Sleep.

1211
02:21:10,671 --> 02:21:12,537
Sleep, Godfather.

1212
02:21:27,896 --> 02:21:29,557
Our friend's dead.

1213
02:22:22,576 --> 02:22:24,533
Speak... tell me.

1214
02:22:26,163 --> 02:22:32,409
You have lost the faith of the people.

1215
02:22:33,879 --> 02:22:38,294
He who builds on the people
builds on mud.

1216
02:22:38,759 --> 02:22:42,468
And Michael Corleone's message?

1217
02:22:59,446 --> 02:23:05,818
It's very important.
I must whisper it in your ear.

1218
02:23:09,623 --> 02:23:11,660
He's clean.

1219
02:23:20,717 --> 02:23:21,798
Psst.

1220
02:23:30,060 --> 02:23:32,722
Power wears out those who don't have it.

1221
02:25:20,086 --> 02:25:24,000
- Can I talk to you now?
- No, it's not a good time.

1222
02:25:24,090 --> 02:25:27,833
- You're just like my father.
Stay with the family. Go on.

1223
02:25:29,387 --> 02:25:31,173
- Talk to me.
- The twins are dead.

1224
02:25:31,264 --> 02:25:35,007
In about one minute, there will be
carabinieri all over this place.

1225
02:25:36,353 --> 02:25:39,095
Get everybody to the cars, quietly.

1226
02:25:39,606 --> 02:25:41,142
- Got it.
- Quiet.

1227
02:25:55,664 --> 02:25:58,827
The name Corleone
will be associated with a voice.

1228
02:26:08,677 --> 02:26:09,963
Dad...

1229
02:26:26,444 --> 02:26:30,563
- You don't have to do this to me.
- Do what? What do you mean?

1230
02:26:57,017 --> 02:26:58,303
Dad...

1231
02:27:15,285 --> 02:27:17,276
No! Mary!

1232
02:27:20,540 --> 02:27:21,951
God, no!
