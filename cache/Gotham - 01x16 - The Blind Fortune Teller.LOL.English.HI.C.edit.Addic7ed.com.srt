2
00:00:02,601 --> 00:00:04,134
I start a new job in the morning.

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,367
A new job?! Congratulations!

4
00:00:05,402 --> 00:00:07,503
I'm coming to work at the GCPD.

5
00:00:07,537 --> 00:00:09,338
I'm your new medical examiner.

6
00:00:09,372 --> 00:00:11,574
I have some questions I need to
ask the members of the board.

7
00:00:11,608 --> 00:00:13,509
- What kind of questions?
- About Arkham.

8
00:00:13,543 --> 00:00:15,311
It seems very likely those gangsters

9
00:00:15,345 --> 00:00:16,679
are actually given their shares in Arkham

10
00:00:16,713 --> 00:00:18,414
by Wayne Enterprises.

11
00:00:18,448 --> 00:00:20,616
This nightclub makes a lot of money.

12
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:23,052
That's why I want to re-open
it under your care.

13
00:00:23,086 --> 00:00:25,921
- I can have the club?
- You're with me now.

14
00:00:25,956 --> 00:00:27,957
What is this place? Where are we?

He dropped off his keys, like, last week.

I don't like him.

84
00:05:26,787 --> 00:05:28,521
I have no idea why he did it.

00:05:31,024 --> 00:05:32,058
Beats me.

00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,701

00:05:45,472 --> 00:05:46,572
I will slap you silly.

90
00:05:46,607 --> 00:05:47,607
You wish.

91
00:05:47,641 --> 00:05:48,608
Don't think I can't.

00:05:48,642 --> 00:05:49,976
Whoa, kids.

93
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:51,844
What's the big problem, anyhow?

94
00:05:51,878 --> 00:05:53,546
The Graysons are a bunch
of arrogant buttheads

95
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,748
- is the problem.
- The Lloyds are feckless drunkards,

96
00:05:55,782 --> 00:05:57,383
is more like it.

97
00:05:57,417 --> 00:05:59,018
So it's a family feud.

98
00:05:59,052 --> 00:06:00,619
Graysons don't get along with Lloyds.

99
00:06:00,654 --> 00:06:02,521
Been that way for years.

100
00:06:02,556 --> 00:06:03,823
It's sort of a tradition.

101
00:06:03,857 --> 00:06:05,624
You guys fight like this every night?

102
00:06:05,659 --> 00:06:07,259
No.

103
00:06:07,294 --> 00:06:09,562
That was just her idiot uncle
doing his thing.

104
00:06:09,596 --> 00:06:11,463
You know damn well it must be Lila's fault.

105
00:06:12,532 --> 00:06:13,933
- Mary...
- What?

106
00:06:18,939 --> 00:06:20,673
GORDON: Hey.

107
00:06:20,707 --> 00:06:22,641
Sorry the date went south.

108
00:06:22,676 --> 00:06:23,709
Are you kidding?

109
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:24,710
Best date ever.

110
00:06:24,744 --> 00:06:26,345
Who gets to see a circus brawl?

111
00:06:26,379 --> 00:06:27,513
True.

112
00:06:27,547 --> 00:06:29,348
None of them will talk, of course.

113
00:06:29,382 --> 00:06:31,617
So I've no idea what
those two were fighting over.

114
00:06:31,651 --> 00:06:33,552
I think they're rival lovers.

115
00:06:33,586 --> 00:06:35,821
Their families have been
fighting since way back,

116
00:06:35,855 --> 00:06:37,489
but this particular fight was

117
00:06:37,524 --> 00:06:39,458
apparently over a woman named Lila.

118
00:06:39,492 --> 00:06:42,294
She's a snake dancer in the sideshow.

119
00:06:42,328 --> 00:06:43,729
- Wow.
- I know.

120
00:06:43,763 --> 00:06:45,430
How cool is that? A snake dancer.

121
00:06:45,465 --> 00:06:47,566
No, I mean, wow, you're really good.

122
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,302
- People talk to doctors.
- I guess so.

123
00:06:50,336 --> 00:06:52,003
I should find this woman
Lila, make sure she's okay.

124
00:06:52,038 --> 00:06:53,538
Might take a little awhile.

125
00:06:53,573 --> 00:06:54,673
I'll have a patrolman drive you home.

126
00:06:54,707 --> 00:06:57,476
Oh... I could come with you.

127
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,711
Lee, this is police business.

128
00:06:59,745 --> 00:07:01,780
Come on, Jim.

129
00:07:01,814 --> 00:07:02,981
I'm dying to meet Lila.

130
00:07:03,015 --> 00:07:04,482
(laughs)

131
00:07:04,517 --> 00:07:07,485
Well, bringing along medical personnel

132
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,687
is a justifiable precaution,

133
00:07:08,721 --> 00:07:10,455
- I guess.
- There you go.

134
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:14,859
Sir... where's Lila?

135
00:07:14,894 --> 00:07:16,261
Lila?

136
00:07:16,295 --> 00:07:18,329
The Snake Dancer.

137
00:07:26,505 --> 00:07:27,939
(knocking on door)

138
00:07:32,945 --> 00:07:33,945
GCPD.

139
00:07:33,979 --> 00:07:35,346
We need to speak with Lila.

140
00:07:35,381 --> 00:07:37,515
She's not here.

141
00:07:37,549 --> 00:07:38,916
Why? What's happened?

142
00:07:38,951 --> 00:07:40,351
Where is she?

143
00:07:40,386 --> 00:07:42,987
Uh, I don't know.

144
00:07:43,021 --> 00:07:44,589
She was supposed to be home ages ago.

145
00:07:44,623 --> 00:07:45,623
You a relative?

146
00:07:45,657 --> 00:07:47,925
Uh, I'm her son... Jerome.

147
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,595
Jerome, when did you last see her?

148
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:52,563
This morning.

149
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:54,465
She was here when I left for the library.

150
00:07:54,499 --> 00:07:56,767
Relax, Jerome, this gentleman is just here

151
00:07:56,802 --> 00:07:58,469
because Owen and Al had a disagreement.

152
00:07:58,503 --> 00:08:01,672
Your mother's fine,
gone on a spree, no doubt.

153
00:08:01,707 --> 00:08:03,774
- You know how she is.
- JEROME: A spree?

154
00:08:03,809 --> 00:08:06,944
Without her hat, her coat or her purse?

155
00:08:08,013 --> 00:08:10,748
And look at Sheba.

156
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:12,249
She's distraught.

157
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:13,517
She knows something's wrong.

158
00:08:13,552 --> 00:08:15,786
The snake does seem to be agitated.

159
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,955
RINGMASTER: Sir... (chuckles quietly)

160
00:08:17,989 --> 00:08:19,523
she's what you call a party girl.

161
00:08:19,557 --> 00:08:21,358
Back in the morning with her knickers

162
00:08:21,393 --> 00:08:23,394
in a handbag, sure as eggs.

163
00:08:23,428 --> 00:08:25,696
But she didn't take her handbag, did she?

164
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:29,933
How fast does an animal like that move?

165
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:32,436
Oh, fast walking pace.

166
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,771
They rely on surprise, mainly.

167
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:36,406
Let her out.

168
00:08:37,775 --> 00:08:38,742
I'm sorry?

169
00:08:38,776 --> 00:08:40,944
Let her out.

170
00:09:11,642 --> 00:09:13,676
♪ ♪

171
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,660
WOMAN (in distance): Oh! Oh...

172
00:09:33,697 --> 00:09:35,698
Oh, my God.

173
00:09:35,733 --> 00:09:38,501
(wailing, sobbing)

174
00:09:38,535 --> 00:09:41,504
(gasping)

175
00:09:44,975 --> 00:09:46,442
You knew.

176
00:09:46,477 --> 00:09:48,444
You knew she was here.

177
00:09:48,479 --> 00:09:49,779
No.

178
00:09:49,813 --> 00:09:51,447
Look at me.

179
00:09:55,352 --> 00:09:57,687
She was like that when we found her.

180
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,375
Let's talk straight.

181
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:14,478
Those people out there
are using us as transplant donors.

182
00:10:14,512 --> 00:10:18,115
We are simply spare parts.

183
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:21,018
Unless...

184
00:10:21,052 --> 00:10:23,720
unless we do something about it.

185
00:10:23,755 --> 00:10:26,323
MAN: How?

186
00:10:26,357 --> 00:10:27,724
I have a plan.

187
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:30,961
But you must do exactly what I say.

188
00:10:30,995 --> 00:10:33,463
You do as I say, and I promise you,

189
00:10:33,498 --> 00:10:35,599
I will get some of us out of here alive.

190
00:10:35,633 --> 00:10:36,700
That's right.

191
00:10:36,734 --> 00:10:39,469
No, you heard me correctly.

192
00:10:39,504 --> 00:10:43,206
I said, <i>some...</i> of us.

193
00:10:43,241 --> 00:10:47,744
Because the truth of the
matter is some will die.

194
00:10:49,313 --> 00:10:52,215
But we will die with dignity.

195
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,317
We will die for a reason,

196
00:10:54,352 --> 00:10:56,486
and we will die next to family,

197
00:10:56,521 --> 00:10:59,322
and I tell you what... we are family.

198
00:10:59,357 --> 00:11:02,325
We're all we got.

199
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,328
That's family!

200
00:11:05,363 --> 00:11:08,298
We have one simple choice:

201
00:11:08,332 --> 00:11:11,535
we die here alone on our knees

202
00:11:11,569 --> 00:11:16,139
or we stand up and we fight
with our family!

203
00:11:16,173 --> 00:11:17,741
(cheering, excited chatter)

204
00:11:25,983 --> 00:11:29,119
A couple of riggers found her right here.

205
00:11:29,153 --> 00:11:30,987
We decided to hide her on the truck.

206
00:11:31,022 --> 00:11:32,422
We were going to give her

207
00:11:32,456 --> 00:11:34,658
a proper burial as soon as
we got back on the road.

208
00:11:34,692 --> 00:11:36,559
Decent of you.

209
00:11:36,594 --> 00:11:38,228
Who's "we"? Who else knew?

210
00:11:38,262 --> 00:11:39,963
Just me and the head of the families.

211
00:11:39,997 --> 00:11:42,665
If an outsider killed her, what can you do?

212
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,100
An act of God.

213
00:11:44,135 --> 00:11:46,136
If it was one of us,

214
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:48,071
we always find out.

215
00:11:48,105 --> 00:11:50,106
And we make sure they're punished.

216
00:11:50,141 --> 00:11:51,341
How?

217
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:53,376
We have our ways.

218
00:11:53,411 --> 00:11:55,178
And we have ours.

219
00:11:55,212 --> 00:11:56,446
Hook him up.

220
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,480
(handcuffs clicking)

221
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:12,428
Morning, partner.

222
00:12:12,463 --> 00:12:14,097
Gonna need a little help here.

223
00:12:14,131 --> 00:12:15,365
No kidding.

224
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:16,933
I mean, you're kidding, right?

225
00:12:16,967 --> 00:12:20,103
This isn't an elaborate prank or...?

226
00:12:24,341 --> 00:12:27,544
Tell me about your mother, Jerome.

227
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:32,282
She's my mother.

228
00:12:32,316 --> 00:12:34,117
What can I say? I love her.

229
00:12:34,151 --> 00:12:36,519
She's perfect.

230
00:12:37,555 --> 00:12:39,556
Not a very good cook.

231
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:42,558
Except for that...

232
00:12:42,593 --> 00:12:44,494
Did she have any enemies?

233
00:12:44,528 --> 00:12:45,962
Someone with a grudge?

234
00:12:45,996 --> 00:12:49,032
No.

235
00:12:49,066 --> 00:12:50,700
Boyfriends?

236
00:12:50,734 --> 00:12:51,701
No.

237
00:12:51,735 --> 00:12:54,037
No?

238
00:12:54,071 --> 00:12:56,673
She had lovers.

239
00:12:56,707 --> 00:13:00,443
They're sex partners
really, but not boyfriends.

240
00:13:00,477 --> 00:13:02,078
She didn't want the commitment.

241
00:13:02,112 --> 00:13:03,279
Alphonse Grayson?

242
00:13:03,314 --> 00:13:04,580
Yes, he was one of them.

243
00:13:04,615 --> 00:13:06,149
Owen Lloyd?

244
00:13:06,183 --> 00:13:08,685
Yes.

245
00:13:08,719 --> 00:13:09,686
Any others?

246
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,956
Not that I could put a name to.

247
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:17,560
How do you feel about
your mother's love life?

248
00:13:17,594 --> 00:13:21,297
I feel fine about it.

249
00:13:21,332 --> 00:13:23,132
If not for my mother's love life,

250
00:13:23,167 --> 00:13:24,534
I wouldn't be here, would I?

251
00:13:24,568 --> 00:13:28,104
Sex is a healthy human activity.

252
00:13:28,138 --> 00:13:30,006
Yes, it is.

253
00:13:32,009 --> 00:13:33,943
Do you have any other family?

254
00:13:33,978 --> 00:13:37,647
The circus is my family.

255
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:42,018
One more time. Why did
you assault Mr. Grayson?

256
00:13:42,052 --> 00:13:43,052
You know why.

257
00:13:43,087 --> 00:13:44,721
- Tell me.
- He killed Lila.

258
00:13:44,755 --> 00:13:46,956
Why would he do that?

259
00:13:46,991 --> 00:13:48,257
She was gonna choose me over him,

260
00:13:48,292 --> 00:13:49,592
and he's an arrogant son of a bitch.

261
00:13:49,626 --> 00:13:53,463
Not gonna let a Lloyd
humiliate a Grayson that way.

262
00:13:53,497 --> 00:13:54,964
How come your families don't get along?

263
00:13:54,999 --> 00:13:57,400
His great-grandfather falsely accused

264
00:13:57,434 --> 00:14:00,403
my mother's uncle Barry
of stealing a horse.

265
00:14:00,437 --> 00:14:01,404
When was this?

266
00:14:01,438 --> 00:14:02,672
Before the Great War.

267
00:14:02,706 --> 00:14:05,508
- World War One.
- Yeah.

268
00:14:05,542 --> 00:14:07,377
BULLOCK: <i>For three generations,</i>

269
00:14:07,411 --> 00:14:09,579
your families have been feuding
over a stolen horse?

270
00:14:09,613 --> 00:14:11,381
Yes. And the Lloyds are still trash.

271
00:14:11,415 --> 00:14:12,482
Blood is blood.

272
00:14:12,516 --> 00:14:13,983
Must be a hell of a horse.

273
00:14:14,018 --> 00:14:15,618
Why did Mr. Lloyd assault you?

274
00:14:15,653 --> 00:14:18,621
He killed Lila, and fears
I'm gonna kill him for it.

275
00:14:18,656 --> 00:14:20,089
He says the opposite.

276
00:14:20,124 --> 00:14:21,691
He says you killed her.

277
00:14:21,725 --> 00:14:24,927
Yes, I suppose he would
have to say that, wouldn't he?

278
00:14:24,962 --> 00:14:26,262
It wasn't uncle Owen.

279
00:14:26,297 --> 00:14:28,064
He could never do such a terrible thing.

280
00:14:28,098 --> 00:14:29,065
Holy crap, Mary!

281
00:14:29,099 --> 00:14:30,600
How can you be so blind?

282
00:14:30,634 --> 00:14:32,201
Quiet, you.

283
00:14:32,236 --> 00:14:33,336
Yeah, quiet, you.

284
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:34,437
You're the blind one.

285
00:14:34,471 --> 00:14:35,471
My brother is a man of honor.

286
00:14:35,506 --> 00:14:37,173
Your uncle is a violent drunk.

287
00:14:37,207 --> 00:14:39,375
- Do the math, little girl.
- My uncle is an artist.

288
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:42,211
Your brother is a conceited
muscle-head, like the rest

289
00:14:42,246 --> 00:14:43,346
of you flying douche bags.

290
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,615
I can't believe I ever thought I loved you.

291
00:14:45,649 --> 00:14:47,350
Enough. Huh?

292
00:14:57,061 --> 00:14:58,895
(door opens)

293
00:14:58,929 --> 00:15:00,096
They're coming.

294
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:01,364
Are you ready?

295
00:15:01,398 --> 00:15:02,932
CROWD: Yes!

296
00:15:02,967 --> 00:15:04,901
I said, are you ready?!

297
00:15:04,935 --> 00:15:06,703
CROWD: Yes!

298
00:15:10,407 --> 00:15:13,076
Inmate 57A, raise your hand.

299
00:15:14,645 --> 00:15:16,646
57A...

300
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,648
Raise your hand.

301
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,687
Step forward.

302
00:15:29,426 --> 00:15:31,661
One moment, please, sir.

303
00:15:33,164 --> 00:15:36,232
We need to talk.

304
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,444
Back up, inmate.

305
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:48,113
You're in violation.

306
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:50,182
57A, step forward!

307
00:15:50,246 --> 00:15:52,213
Excuse me one moment, please.

308
00:15:52,248 --> 00:15:54,215
I'm the new "shot caller" here.

309
00:15:54,946 --> 00:15:56,513
My name is Fish Mooney,

310
00:15:56,547 --> 00:15:59,516
and with all due respect, for you and I

311
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,885
to have a good working relationship,

312
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,987
there's some things that need to change.

313
00:16:04,022 --> 00:16:05,255
Is that right?

314
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:06,490
What's your name?

315
00:16:06,524 --> 00:16:08,959
None of your damn business what my name is.

316
00:16:08,993 --> 00:16:11,462
Right. Okay, well...

317
00:16:11,496 --> 00:16:13,363
I know you have a job to do.

318
00:16:13,398 --> 00:16:16,266
And I am more than willing to give you 57A,

319
00:16:16,301 --> 00:16:18,268
in exchange for

320
00:16:18,303 --> 00:16:22,239
60 crates of water, 30 blankets,
50 pounds of fresh fruit,

321
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:24,174
and a few magazines.

322
00:16:24,209 --> 00:16:27,578
What if I refuse?

323
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:29,613
What will you do?

324
00:16:29,648 --> 00:16:33,551
Well, I'd be willing to give you 57A,

325
00:16:33,585 --> 00:16:35,085
just not alive.

326
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:39,924
- We need them alive.
- Exactly.

327
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,560
I'm gonna count to three.

328
00:16:42,594 --> 00:16:44,929
You'll disappear

329
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:46,697
or get a severe beating.

330
00:16:46,732 --> 00:16:48,899
I'm gonna take that as a no.

331
00:16:48,934 --> 00:16:50,868
One...

332
00:16:50,902 --> 00:16:52,637
two...

333
00:17:03,949 --> 00:17:05,516
(grunting)

334
00:17:15,494 --> 00:17:17,495
(men panting)

335
00:17:24,937 --> 00:17:28,106
It's simple economics.

336
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,141
Our lives are worth something.

337
00:17:32,378 --> 00:17:36,648
60 crates of water, 30 blankets...

338
00:17:36,682 --> 00:17:38,483
You...

339
00:17:38,517 --> 00:17:39,985
you're coming with me.

340
00:17:40,019 --> 00:17:43,154
The manager is gonna be
very unhappy with you.

341
00:17:43,189 --> 00:17:45,056
(chuckles)

342
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:52,464
I would think this manager

343
00:17:52,498 --> 00:17:54,866
wouldn't be too happy with you either.

344
00:17:54,901 --> 00:17:57,402
So if he wants to talk to me,

345
00:17:57,437 --> 00:17:59,871
I'll be right here.

346
00:17:59,906 --> 00:18:01,440
Manager doesn't come down here.

347
00:18:01,474 --> 00:18:05,878
Well, looks like we have a standoff.

348
00:18:05,912 --> 00:18:08,947
I'll tell you what.

349
00:18:08,982 --> 00:18:10,582
I can be flexible.

350
00:18:10,617 --> 00:18:13,585
So I'll go talk to this manager,

351
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:16,221
but while I'm gone,
you're going to stay right here,

352
00:18:16,256 --> 00:18:18,090
as our guest.

353
00:18:18,124 --> 00:18:19,458
How's that sound?

354
00:18:23,396 --> 00:18:25,397
We'll be back.

355
00:18:35,008 --> 00:18:36,208
MAN: Yeah!

356
00:18:36,243 --> 00:18:38,177
(crowd cheering)

357
00:19:10,111 --> 00:19:12,245
Wait, back up a little.

358
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:14,614
So you set the snake loose?

359
00:19:14,649 --> 00:19:16,249
- Yes, ma'am.
- To track down the body?

360
00:19:16,283 --> 00:19:17,884
Yes, ma'am.

361
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,553
Snakes have an excellent sense of smell.

362
00:19:19,587 --> 00:19:21,087
Well, now I know.

363
00:19:21,122 --> 00:19:23,089
And your prime suspects

364
00:19:23,124 --> 00:19:25,225
are a clown and an acrobat?

365
00:19:25,259 --> 00:19:27,127
Yeah.

366
00:19:27,161 --> 00:19:29,096
Ain't this one a doozy?

367
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:30,897
Your victim, Lila Valeska,

368
00:19:30,932 --> 00:19:33,033
was killed by a large knife or hatchet.

369
00:19:33,067 --> 00:19:35,168
Multiple blows to the head and upper torso.

370
00:19:35,203 --> 00:19:37,404
Around 3:00 yesterday afternoon.

371
00:19:37,438 --> 00:19:39,640
From 2:30 to 4:15, both Grayson and Lloyd

372
00:19:39,674 --> 00:19:41,308
were in the ring for the matinee.

373
00:19:41,342 --> 00:19:42,976
Well, how precise is that time of death?

374
00:19:43,011 --> 00:19:45,012
Give or take 45 minutes.

375
00:19:45,046 --> 00:19:47,915
Still possible then, but cutting it close.

376
00:19:47,949 --> 00:19:49,550
Hold and press your guys,

377
00:19:49,584 --> 00:19:51,151
but keep looking.

378
00:19:51,383 --> 00:19:52,920
Yeah, boss. Forensics is
working the crime scene now.

379
00:19:52,954 --> 00:19:55,723
We're going through her phone records.

380
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,528
All right!

381
00:20:00,562 --> 00:20:03,030
We're gonna send the rest of you home now,

382
00:20:03,065 --> 00:20:05,633
but the investigation is ongoing.

383
00:20:05,667 --> 00:20:07,301
Nobody leaves town.

384
00:20:07,336 --> 00:20:09,070
And listen up.

385
00:20:09,104 --> 00:20:10,504
No more fighting!

386
00:20:10,539 --> 00:20:12,340
Look where your friends are.

387
00:20:15,377 --> 00:20:17,745
What good is this feud doing you?

388
00:20:26,221 --> 00:20:28,223
I like it when you act all tough.

389
00:20:30,226 --> 00:20:32,227
"Nobody leave town."

390
00:20:32,261 --> 00:20:34,095
Sounds better when you say it.

391
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:35,463
(laughs)

392
00:20:35,498 --> 00:20:37,132
I feel like we should

393
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:39,067
finish up our date.

394
00:20:39,101 --> 00:20:40,669
Do you want to come over tonight?

395
00:20:40,703 --> 00:20:42,103
I can cook you dinner.

396
00:20:42,138 --> 00:20:44,172
Sure. That sounds good.

397
00:20:44,207 --> 00:20:45,974
Good.

398
00:20:46,008 --> 00:20:47,108
Get some rest.

399
00:20:47,143 --> 00:20:49,044
I will try. See you later.

400
00:20:52,148 --> 00:20:54,249
I have to ask.

401
00:20:54,284 --> 00:20:56,952
If you were to guess, who
do you think killed Lila?

402
00:20:56,986 --> 00:20:58,353
I try not to guess.

403
00:20:58,388 --> 00:21:00,589
I work the suspects
and I wait on forensics.

404
00:21:00,623 --> 00:21:02,724
Excuse me.

405
00:21:04,728 --> 00:21:08,130
Am I speaking to Detective James Gordon?

406
00:21:08,164 --> 00:21:10,699
Yes.

407
00:21:10,734 --> 00:21:15,471
Then this must be Dr. Thompkins,
the medical examiner.

408
00:21:15,505 --> 00:21:18,240
I'm sorry, how did you know who we were?

409
00:21:18,275 --> 00:21:20,142
My name is Paul Cicero.

410
00:21:20,177 --> 00:21:23,379
I'm a psychic with the sideshow.

411
00:21:23,413 --> 00:21:26,249
Lila Valeska was an old friend of mine.

412
00:21:26,283 --> 00:21:28,251
A psychic. I see.

413
00:21:28,285 --> 00:21:30,186
How could I help you, Mr. Cicero?

414
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:35,191
I sense that you don't think
Owen or Alphonse are guilty.

415
00:21:35,225 --> 00:21:36,426
You must be psychic.

416
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,994
In which case,

417
00:21:38,028 --> 00:21:39,963
perhaps you'd like to hear the message

418
00:21:39,997 --> 00:21:43,032
Lila sent me from the other side.

419
00:21:43,067 --> 00:21:45,268
Thanks, Mr. Cicero,
we're not quite looking at

420
00:21:45,302 --> 00:21:47,003
the other side just yet.

421
00:21:47,037 --> 00:21:49,572
As you wish. I'm merely a messenger.

422
00:21:49,607 --> 00:21:51,942
What's the message?

423
00:21:51,976 --> 00:21:54,244
Thank you, Doctor.

424
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,314
Lila told me

425
00:21:57,348 --> 00:21:59,116
that the servant

426
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:00,617
of the Devil

427
00:22:00,651 --> 00:22:04,287
lies in the garden of the Iron Sisters.

428
00:22:04,322 --> 00:22:06,256
The Iron Sisters?

429
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:07,457
What does that mean?

430
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:08,926
I don't know.

431
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,027
We'll get right on it.

432
00:22:10,061 --> 00:22:13,130
I don't think sarcasm
is your métier, James.

433
00:22:13,164 --> 00:22:15,065
Make of the message what you will.

434
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,333
Good day to you both.

435
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:18,602
(whistles a short tune)

436
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:27,011
Well, that wasn't very open-minded of you.

437
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:29,346
Oh, come on, Lee. He's a fraud.

438
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:30,715
He's gonna go straight to the press

439
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:32,550
and say he's consulting on the case.

440
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:33,951
He's looking for publicity.

441
00:22:33,986 --> 00:22:35,286
Maybe.

442
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:38,122
If you were gonna send a message

443
00:22:38,157 --> 00:22:39,490
from beyond the grave,

444
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:41,192
don't you think priority number one

445
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:43,161
would be the killer's name
and not a riddle?

446
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,595
Who knows how it works?

447
00:22:46,265 --> 00:22:47,632
All right. I'm not gonna argue with you.

448
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,400
Good.

449
00:22:49,435 --> 00:22:51,069
Later, then.

450
00:22:52,605 --> 00:22:54,005
Later.

451

(footsteps approaching)

452
00:23:04,417 --> 00:23:06,618
They called to confirm

453
00:23:06,652 --> 00:23:10,155
your meeting with the board
of Wayne Enterprises tomorrow.

454
00:23:10,189 --> 00:23:12,424
Excellent.

455
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:14,326
I was afraid they'd postpone again.

456
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,527
Well, I'll say it one more time.

457
00:23:15,562 --> 00:23:17,196
I think that, uh,

458
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:20,065
it's an incredibly bad idea, Master Bruce.

459
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:23,302
I think it's reckless,
I think it's premature,

460
00:23:23,336 --> 00:23:25,104
and, quite frankly,
I think it's bloody dangerous.

461

00:25:50,003 --> 00:25:51,470
Lee...

507
00:25:51,504 --> 00:25:53,138
it fits an impossible story.

508
00:25:53,173 --> 00:25:54,540
He didn't speak with Lila Valeska;

509
00:25:54,574 --> 00:25:56,642
- she's dead.
- So you say!

510
00:25:56,676 --> 00:25:58,544
Come on, you're a doctor. A scientist.

511
00:25:58,578 --> 00:25:59,945
There are plenty of things in this world

512
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,413
that can't be explained
by rational science.

513
00:26:01,448 --> 00:26:02,615
Yeah, people who enjoy

514
00:26:02,649 --> 00:26:03,816
folk dancing, for instance.

515
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:05,384
Doesn't mean ghosts exist.

516
00:26:05,419 --> 00:26:07,053
You're very arrogant in your certainty.

517
00:26:07,087 --> 00:26:10,656
What if this is a clue to a murder?

518
00:26:10,691 --> 00:26:12,125
The poor woman!

519
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,395
(sighs)

520
00:26:15,429 --> 00:26:17,063
Fine. I'll go myself.

521
00:26:17,097 --> 00:26:19,099
- Thank you.
- Sure.

522
00:26:19,133 --> 00:26:20,834
- I'll come with you.
- Okay.

523
00:26:20,868 --> 00:26:22,669
We'll go together.
First thing in the morning.

524
00:26:22,703 --> 00:26:23,803
Morning?

525
00:26:25,606 --> 00:26:27,040
Now?

526
00:26:27,074 --> 00:26:28,475
You want to go now?

527
00:26:29,677 --> 00:26:30,911
It's only a half a mile away.

528
00:26:30,945 --> 00:26:32,579
It's dark.

529
00:26:32,614 --> 00:26:34,081
I have a flashlight.

530
00:26:34,115 --> 00:26:36,016
(fork clatters on plate)

531
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:37,718
(man coughs)

532
00:26:37,752 --> 00:26:39,953
(cars rattle on bridge)

533
00:26:39,988 --> 00:26:42,523
GORDON: So what are we looking
for, exactly, do you think?

534
00:26:42,557 --> 00:26:43,891
THOMPKINS: I know, I know.

535
00:26:43,925 --> 00:26:45,793
This is probably a complete waste of time.

536
00:26:45,827 --> 00:26:47,962
- Thank you for doing this.
- No problem.

537
00:26:47,996 --> 00:26:51,465
But, uh, let's not make
a habit out of it, okay?

538
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,967
This is no place for a lady.

539
00:26:53,001 --> 00:26:54,836
Ha!

540
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:56,871
What do you mean, "ha"?

541
00:26:56,905 --> 00:26:58,606
You're a hypocrite.

542
00:26:58,641 --> 00:27:00,508
You say you want a strong woman

543
00:27:00,542 --> 00:27:02,710
to share this crazy life you've chosen,

544
00:27:02,745 --> 00:27:03,945
but when push comes to shove,

545
00:27:03,979 --> 00:27:06,481
you want me to stay home and bake cookies.

546
00:27:08,517 --> 00:27:10,418
Not cookies, necessarily.

547
00:27:10,453 --> 00:27:12,554
Pie. Any kind of pie.

548
00:27:12,588 --> 00:27:14,122
Ha, ha!

549
00:27:14,157 --> 00:27:18,427
So if someone were to throw something

550
00:27:18,461 --> 00:27:19,828
from a car on the bridge,

551
00:27:19,863 --> 00:27:21,096
this is where it would land.

552
00:27:21,131 --> 00:27:22,498
(Gordon sighs)

553
00:27:22,532 --> 00:27:25,000
Yeah, I guess you're right.

554
00:27:25,035 --> 00:27:27,436
(sighs)

555
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:42,018
Lee...

556
00:27:42,052 --> 00:27:44,387
(gasps quietly)

557
00:27:47,725 --> 00:27:49,959
THOMPKINS: THFC.

558
00:27:49,994 --> 00:27:51,461
What does that mean?

559
00:27:51,495 --> 00:27:53,463
The Hellfire Club.

560
00:27:53,497 --> 00:27:55,765
It's a Satanist cult.

561
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,035
Committed a string of ritual murders.

562
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:02,072
But they haven't been active
for a decade or more.

563
00:28:02,106 --> 00:28:04,041
I guess they're back.

564
00:28:05,843 --> 00:28:07,578
No.

565
00:28:07,612 --> 00:28:09,780
No, I don't think so.

566
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:14,204
Hey, Sarge, I'm gonna need

567
00:28:14,238 --> 00:28:16,073
a couple of mobile units
to pick some people up.

568
00:28:16,136 --> 00:28:18,804
But listen... they need careful handling.

569
00:28:31,285 --> 00:28:32,886
Sir, they're in three and four.

570
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,087
Thanks, Zeke. Neither of them knows

571
00:28:34,121 --> 00:28:35,255
the other one's here, right?

572
00:28:35,289 --> 00:28:36,590
Right, like you said.

573
00:28:36,624 --> 00:28:38,058
Ah, good work.

574
00:28:38,092 --> 00:28:40,026
Just bear in mind that you could be wrong

575
00:28:40,061 --> 00:28:41,661
- about all of this.
- I will bear it in mind.

576
00:28:41,696 --> 00:28:42,996
I will, but I'm not wrong.

577
00:28:43,031 --> 00:28:45,098
So go on home now, lady.

578
00:28:45,133 --> 00:28:46,900
Hey.

579
00:28:46,935 --> 00:28:49,269
We were having a perfectly lovely evening.

580
00:28:49,304 --> 00:28:51,238
I am not the one who wanted

581
00:28:51,272 --> 00:28:52,940
to go out searching for Satanist hatchets.

582
00:28:52,974 --> 00:28:55,008
You... know what I wanted to do.

583
00:28:55,043 --> 00:28:57,111
You're right.

584
00:28:57,145 --> 00:28:58,112
Uh-huh. I'm sorry, what?

585
00:29:00,715 --> 00:29:02,950
I tend to get overly enthusiastic

586
00:29:02,984 --> 00:29:04,318
about things. It's an issue for me.

587
00:29:04,352 --> 00:29:05,853
My mom always said...

588
00:29:05,887 --> 00:29:07,822
Oh, who gives a crap
what my mom said, right?

589
00:29:07,856 --> 00:29:09,890
(sighs)

590
00:29:09,925 --> 00:29:11,125
Have a good night, Jim.

591
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:12,326
Let me know how it all turns out.

592
00:29:12,361 --> 00:29:14,028
Good night, Lee.

593
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:16,631
Wait!

594
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:29,744
What you said earlier,

595
00:29:29,778 --> 00:29:31,646
about hypocrisy, sharing lives...

596
00:29:33,716 --> 00:29:36,050
You're right. Let's go.

597
00:29:37,219 --> 00:29:38,620
I'm what?

598
00:29:42,224 --> 00:29:44,059
(whispering): Right.

599
00:29:44,093 --> 00:29:45,927
(clears throat)

600
00:29:55,138 --> 00:29:57,706
Good evening, Mr. Cicero.

601
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,741
Sorry to bring you down here so late.

602
00:30:01,044 --> 00:30:03,812
Good evening, Detective Gordon;

603
00:30:03,847 --> 00:30:05,314
Dr. Thompkins.

604
00:30:05,348 --> 00:30:07,716
How did you...

605
00:30:07,751 --> 00:30:09,918
He smells your perfume.

606
00:30:09,953 --> 00:30:11,620
We solved the message Lila sent you.

607
00:30:11,655 --> 00:30:13,188
Oh?

608
00:30:13,223 --> 00:30:15,624
Took us to Arkham Bridge Park.

609
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:18,360
We found a hatchet there

610
00:30:18,395 --> 00:30:21,230
with Satanist symbols scratched into it.

611
00:30:21,264 --> 00:30:22,865
Dear lord.

612
00:30:22,899 --> 00:30:24,367
You know what that hatchet
means, Mr. Cicero?

613
00:30:24,401 --> 00:30:25,835
Tell me.

614
00:30:25,869 --> 00:30:27,703
It means you're an accessory to murder.

615
00:30:27,738 --> 00:30:29,072
Such drama.

616
00:30:29,136 --> 00:30:31,571
I merely passed along a message.

617
00:30:31,606 --> 00:30:33,340
GORDON: A message from the dead.

618
00:30:33,374 --> 00:30:34,474
Didn't happen.

619
00:30:34,508 --> 00:30:37,677
Which means you invented the message...

620
00:30:37,712 --> 00:30:40,180
which means you had someone
plant the hatchet

621
00:30:40,214 --> 00:30:42,082
for us to find.

622
00:30:42,116 --> 00:30:43,717
You wanted us to think

623
00:30:43,751 --> 00:30:46,086
Satanist were responsible for Lila's death.

624
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,421
(exhales)

625
00:30:47,455 --> 00:30:49,022
You're protecting somebody.

626
00:30:49,057 --> 00:30:51,024
Lila spoke to me.

627
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:52,259
That's all.

628
00:30:56,164 --> 00:30:57,164
GORDON: You know,

629
00:30:57,198 --> 00:30:59,400
a hatchet is a clumsy ploy.

630
00:30:59,434 --> 00:31:01,769
You wouldn't try it
unless you were desperate.

631
00:31:03,371 --> 00:31:06,206
Which suggests
you're protecting someone close.

632
00:31:06,241 --> 00:31:09,109
Someone you love.

633
00:31:09,144 --> 00:31:14,682
This fantasia was conjured
in your blinkered mind.

634
00:31:14,716 --> 00:31:17,752
If you could only see what I see...

635
00:31:17,786 --> 00:31:20,087
(door opens)

636
00:31:20,122 --> 00:31:22,056
Hi, Jerome.

637
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:23,357
Please.

638
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,559
Take a seat.

639
00:31:24,593 --> 00:31:28,362
You know Mr. Cicero, from the show.

640
00:31:28,397 --> 00:31:29,664
Yes, sir.

641
00:31:29,698 --> 00:31:31,666
Hello, Mr. Cicero.

642
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,601
Good evening, Jerome.

643
00:31:41,076 --> 00:31:42,343
Do you know why you're here?

644
00:31:42,378 --> 00:31:44,445
Did you find out who killed my mother?

645
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,147
You killed your mother, Jerome.

646
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:49,217
Me?

647
00:31:49,251 --> 00:31:51,086
You killed her up on that hill

648
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,154
and Mr. Cicero let you
clean up in his trailer.

649
00:31:53,189 --> 00:31:54,489
He told you to scratch

650
00:31:54,523 --> 00:31:56,024
the Satanist stuff on the hatchet

651
00:31:56,058 --> 00:31:57,225
and throw it off the bridge.

652
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:00,095
Sir, that's... absurd and...

653
00:32:00,129 --> 00:32:03,398
- and offensive.
- But it's the truth.

654
00:32:03,432 --> 00:32:07,369
What I don't know is why this man
risked so much to help you.

655
00:32:07,403 --> 00:32:09,071
I think he's your father.

656
00:32:11,574 --> 00:32:13,642
JEROME: You don't know
what you're talking about.

657
00:32:13,676 --> 00:32:15,777
My father was a sea captain.

658
00:32:16,813 --> 00:32:18,614
GORDON: Am I wrong,

659
00:32:18,648 --> 00:32:19,681
Mr. Cicero?

660
00:32:19,716 --> 00:32:21,316
Yes.

661
00:32:21,351 --> 00:32:22,651
He was a sea captain.

662
00:32:22,685 --> 00:32:24,520
His name was Sven Karlsen. He died at sea.

663
00:32:24,554 --> 00:32:27,690
What was the name of his ship?

664
00:32:27,724 --> 00:32:30,225
He worked on a lot of different ships.

665
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:32,428
The one he went down in.

666
00:32:35,432 --> 00:32:36,699
She never said.

667
00:32:36,733 --> 00:32:39,635
We can do a blood test to prove I'm right.

668
00:32:39,669 --> 00:32:42,004
It takes only half an hour
to get a foolproof result.

669
00:32:42,038 --> 00:32:43,472
Isn't that right, Dr. Thompkins?

670
00:32:43,507 --> 00:32:45,408
Yes.

671
00:32:45,442 --> 00:32:47,743
Save yourself a needle.

672
00:32:47,778 --> 00:32:50,179
I do hate needles.

673
00:32:51,815 --> 00:32:54,216
I'm sorry, Jerome.

674
00:32:54,251 --> 00:32:57,053
What are you talking about?

675
00:32:57,087 --> 00:32:59,689
He's right.

676
00:32:59,723 --> 00:33:02,625
I am your father.

677
00:33:02,659 --> 00:33:04,393
No, you're not. Why would you say that?

678
00:33:04,428 --> 00:33:07,063
You must have suspected the truth.

679
00:33:07,097 --> 00:33:08,698
You're not my father.
My mother would never...

680
00:33:08,732 --> 00:33:10,366
Your mother was

681
00:33:10,401 --> 00:33:12,435
a cruel woman; she was often unkind to me,

682
00:33:12,469 --> 00:33:17,774
but she did once love me, in her way.

683
00:33:17,808 --> 00:33:21,144
And she loved you very much.

684
00:33:21,178 --> 00:33:24,247
That's why she gave you a better father.

685
00:33:26,751 --> 00:33:29,319
(crying)

686
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:35,859
(chuckling)

687
00:33:39,697 --> 00:33:42,065
My mother

688
00:33:42,099 --> 00:33:43,233
was a cold-hearted whore

689
00:33:43,267 --> 00:33:44,768
who never loved anyone.

690
00:33:44,802 --> 00:33:46,503
And she'd never touch

691
00:33:46,537 --> 00:33:50,040
a pathetic old creep like you.

692
00:33:50,074 --> 00:33:52,109
All these years,

693
00:33:52,143 --> 00:33:54,111
do you think I was kind to you

694
00:33:54,145 --> 00:33:55,512
because I'm such a good man?

695
00:33:55,546 --> 00:33:58,382
If I wasn't your father,

696
00:33:58,416 --> 00:34:02,185
would I help you as I have,
after what you did?

697
00:34:06,257 --> 00:34:09,026
My father... Hm.

698
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,627
I'll be damned.

699
00:34:13,231 --> 00:34:15,432
Oh, that's very funny.

700
00:34:15,467 --> 00:34:17,601
(chuckles)

701
00:34:17,635 --> 00:34:19,570
(laughs)

702
00:34:19,604 --> 00:34:22,306
Ba-doom-shh!

703
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:25,743
Looks like the bitch got me
with a zinger in the end.

704
00:34:25,777 --> 00:34:28,579
Why did you kill your mother, Jerome?

705
00:34:28,613 --> 00:34:31,282
Oh, you know how mothers are.

706
00:34:31,316 --> 00:34:35,219
She just kept pushing.

707
00:34:35,253 --> 00:34:37,054
And I'm like, fine, mom.

708
00:34:37,089 --> 00:34:38,522
Be a whore.

709
00:34:38,557 --> 00:34:41,058
Be a drunken whore, even.

710
00:34:41,093 --> 00:34:45,429
But don't be a nagging drunken whore.

711
00:34:45,464 --> 00:34:47,164
You know?

712
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:50,601
Don't come yell at me to do the dishes

713
00:34:50,636 --> 00:34:52,470
if you've been banging

714
00:34:52,504 --> 00:34:54,705
a clown in the next room!

715
00:34:57,342 --> 00:34:59,010
You know?

716
00:34:59,044 --> 00:35:01,245
(hysterical laughter)

717
00:35:19,265 --> 00:35:21,266
Long night, huh?

718
00:35:22,735 --> 00:35:25,036
Guess it got kind of ugly.

719
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:26,471
Yes, it did.

720
00:35:26,505 --> 00:35:29,140
You okay?

721
00:35:29,175 --> 00:35:31,242
I'm good.

722
00:35:31,277 --> 00:35:32,644
(sighs)

723
00:35:32,678 --> 00:35:34,646
Truly.

724
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,716
It was ugly, but it was also
kind of thrilling.

725
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:39,651
Thrilling?

726
00:35:39,685 --> 00:35:42,487
Thrilling and scary.

727
00:35:42,521 --> 00:35:46,291
Like... Like looking down
a deep, dark tunnel.

728
00:35:46,325 --> 00:35:47,492
(chuckles)

729
00:35:52,398 --> 00:35:54,232
Thanks for letting me be there.

730
00:35:56,602 --> 00:35:59,371
You are an unusual woman.

731
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,707
You just don't know many women.

732
00:36:04,677 --> 00:36:06,678
(laughs)

733
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:19,691
Can we go home now?

734
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,828
Mm-hmm.

735
00:36:51,558 --> 00:36:53,559
♪ ♪

736
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:07,504
ZSASZ: Hello, Penguin.

737
00:37:10,575 --> 00:37:12,476
Victor.

738
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:13,978
How nice.

739
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:16,011
(snaps)

740
00:37:17,814 --> 00:37:20,949
Don Falcone thinks you're messing up.

741
00:37:22,118 --> 00:37:24,520
You don't know how to run a club.

742
00:37:24,554 --> 00:37:26,155
Your numbers...

743
00:37:26,189 --> 00:37:28,557
stink.

744
00:37:29,693 --> 00:37:30,960
With all due respect...

745
00:37:30,994 --> 00:37:33,162
I didn't come here to talk.

746
00:37:34,764 --> 00:37:36,632
Good manners cost nothing, you know?

747
00:37:36,666 --> 00:37:38,667
(whistles)

748
00:37:42,139 --> 00:37:44,940
(gasps)

749
00:37:44,975 --> 00:37:46,709
(Zsasz laughing)

750
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,947
Relax.

751
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:05,782
He's harmless.

752
00:38:05,816 --> 00:38:07,450
Say hi, Butch.

753
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:09,119
Hi.

754
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:12,389
Falcone didn't want to throw him away,

755
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:14,090
so I worked on him in my basement

756
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,725
for a couple of weeks.

757
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,994
He's a whole new man.

758
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:19,663
Right, Butch?

759
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:21,131
Yes, sir, Mr. Zsasz.

760
00:38:21,165 --> 00:38:24,634
Butch knows the club scene up and down.

761
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:26,403
He'll help you out.

762
00:38:27,538 --> 00:38:29,372
But he's...

763
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:31,408
He's Butch Gilzean.

764
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:33,009
He's loyal to Fish Mooney.

765
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:35,078
And he'll do...

766
00:38:35,112 --> 00:38:37,914
exactly what you say.

767
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:41,051
Really?

768
00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:42,552
Really.

769
00:38:42,586 --> 00:38:44,621
(chuckles)

770
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:48,425
Hey, Butch,

771
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:50,593
dance for me.

772
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:56,933
I do good work.

773
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:33,503
Good morning, everyone.

774
00:39:33,568 --> 00:39:34,836
Good morning, Bruce.

775
00:39:34,866 --> 00:39:36,100
Welcome to Wayne Enterprises.

776
00:39:36,134 --> 00:39:37,334
So happy to see you.

777
00:39:37,369 --> 00:39:39,837
Thank you for meeting with me.

778
00:39:41,339 --> 00:39:43,741
I have some questions

779
00:39:43,775 --> 00:39:45,109
regarding Wayne Enterprises
business affairs.

780
00:39:45,143 --> 00:39:46,277
BOARD MEMBER: Of course.

781
00:39:46,311 --> 00:39:47,845
It's your company, after all.

782
00:39:47,879 --> 00:39:49,813
Fire away, young man.

783
00:39:49,848 --> 00:39:52,283
I have two main areas of concern.

784
00:39:52,317 --> 00:39:54,385
Underworld involvement
in the Arkham Project.

785
00:39:55,453 --> 00:39:56,921
And chemical weapons manufacture

786
00:39:56,955 --> 00:39:59,323
at our Wellzyn affiliate.

787
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:06,397
That's great.

788
00:40:06,431 --> 00:40:07,998
Congratulations.

789
00:40:08,033 --> 00:40:09,366
We wanted to thank you.

790
00:40:09,401 --> 00:40:11,168
If you hadn't figure out who killed Lila

791
00:40:11,202 --> 00:40:13,203
and talked to sense to us the way you did,

792
00:40:13,238 --> 00:40:14,938
our families never would have reconciled,

793
00:40:14,973 --> 00:40:16,740
and we could've never gotten together.

794
00:40:16,775 --> 00:40:19,510
Just doing my job.

795
00:40:19,544 --> 00:40:21,078
Hey, if we have a son,
we'll name him Gordon.

796
00:40:21,112 --> 00:40:23,047
Well...

797
00:40:23,081 --> 00:40:24,381
we'll discuss that,

798
00:40:24,416 --> 00:40:25,449
but we're certainly

799
00:40:25,483 --> 00:40:26,984
very grateful.

800
00:40:27,018 --> 00:40:28,485
Sure.

801
00:40:37,228 --> 00:40:38,762
Why so happy?

802
00:40:38,797 --> 00:40:40,898
Happy customers.

803
00:40:40,932 --> 00:40:41,999
That's not it.

804
00:40:42,033 --> 00:40:43,167
It's something else.

805
00:40:44,802 --> 00:40:46,303
You got laid, didn't you?

806
00:40:46,337 --> 00:40:48,772
- That's impressive.
- You slept somewhere

807
00:40:48,806 --> 00:40:51,475
without razors
and you smell like ladies' soap.

808
00:40:51,509 --> 00:40:53,510
Easy catch.

809
00:40:59,317 --> 00:41:01,084
I can only conclude

810
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:03,820
that high-level individuals or groups

811
00:41:03,855 --> 00:41:05,889
within Wayne Enterprises have colluded

812
00:41:05,923 --> 00:41:09,092
in corruption, bribery, racketeering,

813
00:41:09,127 --> 00:41:11,361
and unethical medical research.

814
00:41:11,396 --> 00:41:13,463
Thank you for that input, Bruce.

815
00:41:13,498 --> 00:41:15,165
I'm so sorry if you've been alarmed

816
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:17,734
or upset by these shocking stories

817
00:41:17,769 --> 00:41:19,870
and rumors you've been exposed to.

818
00:41:19,904 --> 00:41:21,905
These are much more than rumors.

819
00:41:21,939 --> 00:41:23,740
We'll look into them thoroughly
and carefully, of course.

820
00:41:23,775 --> 00:41:26,076
Bruce, let's be fair.

821
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:29,346
You've told us nothing with any
substantive proof behind it.

822
00:41:32,717 --> 00:41:34,284
I haven't told you all I know.

823
00:41:34,318 --> 00:41:36,319
No?

824
00:41:36,354 --> 00:41:37,954
What else is there?

825
00:41:37,989 --> 00:41:40,223
I hope you do look closely
into these issues.

826
00:41:40,258 --> 00:41:42,826
Because I'll be raising them at
the next shareholders' meeting

827
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:45,161
with a view to possible legal action.

828
00:41:45,196 --> 00:41:47,230
Dear me.

829
00:41:47,265 --> 00:41:49,466
Legal action?

830
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,167
These are all very deep waters

831
00:41:51,202 --> 00:41:52,702
for such a young man.

832
00:41:52,737 --> 00:41:54,704
My youth is not relevant.

833
00:41:54,739 --> 00:41:56,840
Except that if I were a man,

834
00:41:56,874 --> 00:41:59,709
I would be chairing this board.

835
00:41:59,744 --> 00:42:01,945
And I would be sure that Wayne Enterprises

836
00:42:01,979 --> 00:42:03,179
was run honestly.

837
00:42:03,214 --> 00:42:04,981
Thank you for your time.

838
00:42:24,468 --> 00:42:26,836
The manager says you have a deal.

839
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:29,372
You go up and see him,

840
00:42:29,406 --> 00:42:30,707
I stay here.

841
00:42:37,347 --> 00:42:40,849
- What's your name?
- Schmidt.

842
00:42:40,873 --> 00:42:43,571
Your first name?

843
00:42:45,071 --> 00:42:49,570
- Thomas.
- Thomas. Welcome.

844
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:56,870
