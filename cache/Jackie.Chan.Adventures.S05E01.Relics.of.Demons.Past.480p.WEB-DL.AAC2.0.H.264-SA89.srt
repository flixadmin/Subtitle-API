1
00:00:04,237 --> 00:00:06,405
Jackie: And that
is ursa major,

2
00:00:06,407 --> 00:00:09,641
more commonly referred to
as "the big dipper."

3
00:00:09,643 --> 00:00:11,110
Jade: Incoming!

4
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:15,714
(Jade burps)

5
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:17,116
Jackie: Ohh, Jade!

6
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:18,984
(Tohru giggles)

7
00:00:18,986 --> 00:00:21,520
Jackie: Please, tohru,
do not encourage her.

8
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:23,989
(Jade burps)
(Tohru stifles giggles)

9
00:00:23,991 --> 00:00:25,224
Uncle: Ai yah!

10
00:00:25,226 --> 00:00:28,460
Jade's belly breezes
not important.

11
00:00:28,462 --> 00:00:31,096
Alignment of stars
reveal that now

12
00:00:31,098 --> 00:00:34,800
is very good time
for very bad chi.

13
00:00:41,007 --> 00:00:42,674
(Explosion)

14
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:46,111
Drago: Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

15
00:00:46,113 --> 00:00:49,415
No prison can hold
the son of shendu.

16
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,860
Captain black:
Give it up, drago.

17
00:01:01,862 --> 00:01:04,530
You're not going anywhere...

18
00:01:04,532 --> 00:01:07,499
And neither is
your dragon daddy.

19
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:10,769
Drago: Now who said
anything about busting out
that old gecko?

20
00:01:10,771 --> 00:01:12,971
I'm going solo.

21
00:01:12,973 --> 00:01:14,706
Men: Aaah! Get away!

22
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:16,175
(Jackie gasps)

23
00:01:16,177 --> 00:01:17,709
Jackie:
Drago has black
pinned down.

24
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:20,045
I need to create
a diversion.

25
00:01:20,047 --> 00:01:22,314
Jade: Yo, hothead!

26
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:23,515
Remember me?

27
00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:25,150
There are no "get out
of jail free" cards

28
00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:27,486
as long as j-girl's
still got game.

29
00:01:27,488 --> 00:01:29,188
Black: Drago!

30
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:32,324
Jade: Told ya.

31
00:01:32,326 --> 00:01:33,992
Jackie: Jade!

32
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:39,231
Drago: Hello, payback.

33
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:42,401
Jackie: Jade!

34
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:18,737
Jackie: Jade!

35
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,444
Jade: You Tarzan,
me Jade.

36
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,114
(Agents screaming)

37
00:02:29,116 --> 00:02:30,582
(Drago growls)

38
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,022
Drago: Mess with a dragon,

39
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:38,857
you're gonna get burned!

40
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:47,533
Jackie: If drago does not
want to help shendu,

41
00:02:47,535 --> 00:02:48,834
then what does he want?

42
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:50,636
Jade: Hello! Freedom!

43
00:02:50,638 --> 00:02:52,371
Tohru: Perhaps
the answer lies

44
00:02:52,373 --> 00:02:54,640
in the alignment of
the "bad chi" stars.

45
00:02:54,642 --> 00:02:56,208
Uncle: Stars, yes,

46
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,544
but also
in uncle's bookshelf.

47
00:02:58,546 --> 00:03:01,446
Come, tohru,
we must do research!

48
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:03,649
Black: I have agents
combing the bay area.

49
00:03:03,651 --> 00:03:05,551
Drago won't get far.

50
00:03:05,553 --> 00:03:08,053
Jade: That overgrown handbag
doesn't stand a chance!

51
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:10,389
So, cb,
what's my assignment?

52
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:11,790
Jackie:
The only assignments

53
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:14,026
you will be getting today
are at school.

54
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:15,460
Jade: Ohhh!

55
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:24,236
(Kids burping)

56
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:29,641
(Jade burps loud and long)

57
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:31,910
Kids: All right!

58
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:34,880
Ms. hardman: Ahem.

59
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:39,518
Jade: Heh heh.
Pardon me?

60
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:49,194
Black:
Looks like t-Rex Jr.'s
catching a catnap.

61
00:03:49,196 --> 00:03:52,864
Jackie: I believe
he is in a trance.

62
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:03,108
(Cell phone rings)

63
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,209
(Drago growls)

64
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:05,444
Black: Jackie.

65
00:04:05,446 --> 00:04:06,645
(Ring)

66
00:04:06,647 --> 00:04:08,013
Jackie: Hold, please.
Aaah!

67
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:17,155
(Phone rings)

68
00:04:17,157 --> 00:04:18,624
Jackie: Hello?

69
00:04:18,626 --> 00:04:21,760
Yes, Ms. hardman,
this is Jade's uncle.

70
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:24,296
Chow: Ready?

71
00:04:24,298 --> 00:04:25,364
Finn: Let's do it.

72
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:29,468
Finn: Closing time.
Everybody out.

73
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,370
(Children groaning)

74
00:04:31,372 --> 00:04:32,704
Man: don't forget
to wash your hands.

75
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:34,306
Woman: Let's go, honey.
It's time to go home.

76
00:04:34,308 --> 00:04:35,540
Second man:
don't give me that.

77
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:43,915
Finn: Eww!
I hate my job.

78
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:46,218
Ratso: Wanna switch?

79
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,655
Chow: Come on!
Show's over. Amscray!
Get outta here!

80
00:04:49,657 --> 00:04:52,658
Drago: I am drago,
the son of shendu!

81
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,227
Serve me well now
and be at my side

82
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:57,329
when I rule the world.

83
00:04:57,331 --> 00:05:00,065
Chow: Uh, sorry, kid,

84
00:05:00,067 --> 00:05:02,434
but your old man
kinda burned us.

85
00:05:02,436 --> 00:05:05,570
Ratso: Yeah. And I got
the scars to prove it.

86
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:08,373
Drago:
You're turning me down?

87
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,542
Finn: Look, all that
world domination stuff

88
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:12,477
just don't pay the rent.

89
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,147
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa whoa whoa whoa!

90
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:16,348
Whaaah!

91
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,816
Drago: Who's next?

92
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:20,152
Chow: Hey,
money isn't everything.

93
00:05:20,154 --> 00:05:21,420
Drago: Agreed.

94
00:05:21,422 --> 00:05:23,388
Now it's time
for your makeovers.

95
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,690
Chow: Makeovers?

96
00:05:24,692 --> 00:05:27,492
Ratso: But I have
sensitive skin.

97
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,861
All: Yeoww! Aaaah!

98
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:40,472
Finn: Smokin'!

99
00:05:40,474 --> 00:05:41,540
(Puffs)

100
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:46,611
Chow: Sweet.

101
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:51,650
Ratso: Hey, I can make
grilled cheese sandwiches
whenever I want!

102
00:05:51,652 --> 00:05:53,685
Finn: So, what should we
steal first?

103
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,921
Chow: Cash?
Ratso: Jewels?

104
00:05:55,923 --> 00:05:58,690
Drago: A fan.

105
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,258
Ratso: Oh, boy.

106
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:04,296
Jade: But what about
freedom of expression?

107
00:06:04,298 --> 00:06:05,764
This is America, you know.

108
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:08,633
Jackie: Jade,
this has nothing to do
with free speech

109
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:11,670
and everything to do
with self-control.

110
00:06:11,672 --> 00:06:14,072
Promise me,
no more burping.

111
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:15,540
Jade: Fine.

112
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:16,708
I'll just explode
from all the built-up gas

113
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,110
before I'm 16.

114
00:06:18,112 --> 00:06:19,544
(Truck brakes screech)

115
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:20,912
Black:
Drago's been spotted.

116
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:23,682
Jackie: Jade, stay here.

117
00:06:23,684 --> 00:06:25,517
Jade: Seriously...
Jackie: Aaah!

118
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:27,586
Jade: don't you ever
get tired of saying that?

119
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:37,696
Drago: The fan's here
somewhere.

120
00:06:37,698 --> 00:06:39,331
I can feel it.

121
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:40,932
Clear the place out.

122
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:43,702
Finn: Thought
you'd never ask.

123
00:06:43,704 --> 00:06:46,638
(People screaming)

124
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:51,777
Finn: Stee-rike!

125
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:55,280
I see a bus pass
in your future.

126
00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:56,348
Unhh!

127
00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:00,318
Black: And I see
prison stripes in yours.

128
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,520
Jade: No way!

129
00:07:01,522 --> 00:07:03,855
The enforcers are now
drago's fire flunkies?

130
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:05,724
Chow: Jackie chan!

131
00:07:05,726 --> 00:07:08,126
Long time, no rumble.

132
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:16,134
Jackie:
I will draw their fire.

133
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:18,136
You run back
to captain black's truck.

134
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:19,304
Jade: But Jackie--

135
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:20,872
Jackie:
And no arguments.

136
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:22,407
(Jade groans)

137
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:25,444
Chow: Come out, come out
wherever you are.

138
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:28,180
Jackie: Hyah!

139
00:07:28,182 --> 00:07:29,247
Chow: Aaah!

140
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:31,783
Ratso: Yeowww!

141
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:40,992
Black: Claws up, drago.

142
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:43,228
Drago: With pleasure.

143
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,696
Black: Aaah! Uhh!

144
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:53,071
Jackie: Unhh!

145
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:58,977
Jade: Hello!
Uncle Jackie?

146
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:04,182
Drago: Say good-bye, Jade.

147
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:09,521
(Jade gasps)

148
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:16,695
Jade: Whoa!

149
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:21,366
Black: I'll grab Jade.
You find drago.

150
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,336
(Air vent whooshes)

151
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,208
Drago: The fan
of the immortals.

152
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,643
(Doorbell rings)

153
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:45,257
Drago: Unhh!

154
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:51,096
(Drago exhales)

155
00:08:51,098 --> 00:08:52,898
Drago: Looks like
we'll have to do this

156
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,900
the old-fashioned way.

157
00:08:57,637 --> 00:09:00,505
Black: You boys
need to cool off.

158
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,309
Chow: Aaah!
Ratso: Whoa!

159
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,282
Finn: Get ready to fry,
small fry.

160
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,687
Finn: (Groans) Whoaaah!

161
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:17,088
Oof!

162
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:20,191
Jade:
May I also interest you
in new car scent?

163
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:41,079
Jade: Hyaaah!

164
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:43,548
Drago: Unhh!

165
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,891
Black: You two all right?

166
00:09:52,893 --> 00:09:55,160
(Rumbling)

167
00:09:58,064 --> 00:09:59,764
(Drago grunts)

168
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,334
Drago: (Groans)

169
00:10:02,336 --> 00:10:04,135
Get the fan!

170
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,176
Chow: ¶ ah ha ha-ha! ¶

171
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,417
Jackie: All of this
for a fan?

172
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:21,019
Uncle: Not a fan.

173
00:10:21,021 --> 00:10:24,089
The fan of
the immortals.

174
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:26,658
Dragon teeny-bopper
wants to absorb

175
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,060
its powerful
wind demon chi.

176
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:30,328
Jackie: But uncle,

177
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:33,264
we already defeated
the other 7 demons.

178
00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:34,499
Ow! Ow!

179
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:36,968
Uncle: Clean wax
out of ears.

180
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,104
Uncle said "demon chi,"

181
00:10:39,106 --> 00:10:41,373
not demons themselves.

182
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:44,209
Tohru, explain research.

183
00:10:44,211 --> 00:10:46,444
Tohru: Thousands
of years ago...

184
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:49,614
An immortal warrior used
a magical fan

185
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:52,684
to defeat xiao fung,
the wind demon.

186
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:01,326
But traces of
the wind demon's power

187
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:04,863
are rumored to have
clung to the fan
throughout the centuries,

188
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:06,264
until--

189
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:08,033
Jackie: They were again
activated

190
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:10,635
by the alignment
of the "bad chi" stars

191
00:11:10,637 --> 00:11:12,871
uncle discovered
last night.

192
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:15,940
Jade: So drago busted out
of section 13

193
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:17,609
in order to double up
on demon powers,

194
00:11:17,611 --> 00:11:19,077
fire <i> and</i> wind.

195
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:21,479
Uncle: By stealing
fan of the immortals.

196
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:25,483
Why did you let demon
take immortal fan?!

197
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:30,021
Jackie: Ohh...Bad day,
bad day, bad day.

198
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:34,959
Finn: This dump
is home sweet home?

199
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:38,930
Drago: This is useless!

200
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:42,767
The wind demon chi
has already been
drained from it.

201
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:46,471
Chow: And that's
a bad thing, right?

202
00:11:46,473 --> 00:11:47,906
All: Yeeowww!

203
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:51,509
Finn: Uh, we're gonna
let you have

204
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:53,978
a little alone time now.

205
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:00,985
Jade: Come on!

206
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:03,722
Let's get outta here
and stomp those fire thugs!

207
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:05,690
Uncle: Do not rush uncle!

208
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:09,094
Demon chi removal spell
very tricky.

209
00:12:09,096 --> 00:12:11,496
Jade, make yourself useful.

210
00:12:11,498 --> 00:12:14,065
Get <i> ancient Tome</i>
à <i> of warts and toads</i>

211
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,600
from bookcase.

212
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:25,009
(Stomach grumbles)

213
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:26,478
(Burps)

214
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,580
Jade: Aaaaaah!

215
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:29,714
(Crash)

216
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:31,116
Jackie: Jade?

217
00:12:31,118 --> 00:12:33,384
(Jade whistling)

218
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:39,624
Ms. hardman: And early
sailing ships

219
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:42,393
were also affected
by the doldrums.

220
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:43,995
(Children giggle)

221
00:12:43,997 --> 00:12:46,030
Ms. hardman: The doldrums
are an area of low pressure

222
00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:48,633
with almost no wind at all.

223
00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:50,702
(Children laughing)

224
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:53,838
(Jade burps loudly)

225
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:01,146
Ms. hardman:
That's it, young lady!

226
00:13:01,148 --> 00:13:04,516
I am sending you
straight to the...

227
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:06,317
Nurse's office.

228
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:12,423
Uncle: Uncle almost finished
with wind demon chi
removal spell.

229
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:14,225
One more thing--

230
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:17,996
why has drago not yet used
wind demon powers?

231
00:13:17,998 --> 00:13:20,131
(Cell phone rings)

232
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,566
Jackie: Hello?

233
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:24,869
Yes, this is Jade's uncle.

234
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:26,070
Oh.

235
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:27,839
I will be right there.

236
00:13:27,841 --> 00:13:30,542
The school says Jade
is not feeling well.

237
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:34,179
I wonder if it has
anything to do

238
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:36,681
with all those sodas
she drinks?

239
00:13:36,683 --> 00:13:38,850
Chow: This guy's worse
than his old man.

240
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:41,820
Ratso: But he looks
so peaceful.

241
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:43,488
Finn: Yeah. So do cobras,

242
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,890
right before they strike.

243
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:56,801
Drago: Raaah!

244
00:13:56,803 --> 00:13:59,070
We're going to school.

245
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:00,638
(School bell rings)

246
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,775
(Children
laugh and shout)

247
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:06,811
Jade: So I'm a little
gassy today.

248
00:14:06,813 --> 00:14:09,147
Blame the cafeteria
burritos.

249
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:12,917
Aaah!

250
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:19,090
Jade:
What's wrong with me?!

251
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:20,225
(Door creaks open)

252
00:14:20,227 --> 00:14:21,926
Drago:
You're short, green,

253
00:14:21,928 --> 00:14:24,195
and a real pain
in the butt.

254
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:28,032
So stick out your chi

255
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:29,601
and say "aaah."

256
00:14:29,603 --> 00:14:31,069
Jade: I'm warning you...

257
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:32,470
I don't feel so--

258
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:34,205
(stomach rumbles)

259
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,241
(Through rushing wind)
Good!

260
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:39,310
All: Aaah! Unhh!

261
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,049
(Shudders)

262
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:46,584
Jackie: Jade?

263
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:48,319
Jade: Uncle Jackie!

264
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:49,721
(Jackie gasps)

265
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:51,322
Jackie:What's happened to you?
Jade:What happened to me?

266
00:14:51,324 --> 00:14:53,524
Jackie: Jade, tell me
you've been fooling around

267
00:14:53,526 --> 00:14:54,859
with uncle's spells.

268
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:56,227
Jade: No, I swear!

269
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:58,529
I just looked up
and bam! Toad girl!

270
00:14:58,531 --> 00:15:01,165
Jackie: It's all right.
Uncle will know what to do.

271
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:03,434
Jade: But what if I'm
a gross-out forever?

272
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:05,536
Just sitting around,
eating flies,

273
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:06,838
waiting to croak.

274
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:12,577
Jackie: Time to leave
before your demon prince
arrives.

275
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:19,584
Drago: I'm gonna need
to see your hall pass.

276
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:21,319
Jackie: Pardon us,
coming through! Got to run!

277
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:22,887
(Drago groans)

278
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:24,789
Drago: Do something!

279
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:30,161
Jackie: Aah!

280
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:31,763
Hop on!

281
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:34,165
Sorry.

282
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:39,804
Aah! Aah aah!
Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!

283
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:41,272
Hot! Hot!

284
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,141
Drago: Cut off their exit!

285
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:51,416
(Jackie sighs in relief)

286
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:53,184
Jade: How did this
happen to me?

287
00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:56,154
Jackie:
You must have absorbed
the wind demon chi

288
00:15:56,156 --> 00:15:58,056
from the immortal fan
at the car wash.

289
00:15:58,058 --> 00:16:00,825
Jade: Me?
The wind demon chi?

290
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:03,094
So, why am I running?

291
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:08,733
Jackie: Jade, the longer
the demon chi
remains inside you,

292
00:16:08,735 --> 00:16:11,669
the harder it will be
for uncle to remove.

293
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:14,672
Uncle: Hello,
uncles antiques.

294
00:16:14,674 --> 00:16:16,774
Jackie: Uncle,
drago and the enforcers

295
00:16:16,776 --> 00:16:18,643
are at Jade's school
and--yaah!

296
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:22,146
Uncle: Jackie? Jackie?!

297
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,482
Drago: Sorry,
your minutes have expired.

298
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:27,151
And now, so will you.

299
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:31,656
Jade: Fire!
(Strong burp)

300
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:45,103
Drago: Aaah!

301
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:51,075
Jade: Excuse me...Not!

302
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:53,878
(Jackie coughs)

303
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,714
Jackie: Uh, I could use
a little fresh air.

304
00:16:56,716 --> 00:16:58,483
Jade: Heh heh. Follow me.

305
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:10,895
(Flames sizzling)

306
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:17,201
Finn: Keep chan busy.

307
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:23,841
Jackie: Jade, run!

308
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:25,543
Uh, hop--whatever!

309
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,981
Finn: Drago wants
the wind demon chi.

310
00:17:29,983 --> 00:17:32,350
Jade: Isn't he enough
of a blowhard already?

311
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:34,052
(Burps, wind rushing)

312
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:36,921
Finn: That is rank!

313
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,458
Aaaah!

314
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:44,896
Finn and chow: Unhh!

315
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:48,132
Jade: Hmm, it's not so bad
being green.

316
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:53,571
Ratso: Yeah?

317
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:57,608
Unhh!

318
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:00,011
Jade: Yes! (Gasps)

319
00:18:00,013 --> 00:18:01,679
Uncle Jackie!

320
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:03,147
Drago: Today's lesson--

321
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:06,017
never stand downwind
from a wind demon.

322
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:09,620
Jade: (Grunts)
Get your claws off me!

323
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:18,296
Jackie: Hyah!

324
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:24,802
Jade: Hey, I'm me!

325
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:27,171
Jackie: But if you're
back to normal,

326
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:29,073
that means...

327
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:32,877
Drago: You're all toast!

328
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:38,516
(Tohru and uncle
chanting spell)

329
00:18:38,518 --> 00:18:40,651
Drago: No!

330
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:51,596
Uncle and tohru: Whoa!

331
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:55,833
Jackie: Uncle!

332
00:18:55,835 --> 00:18:58,202
Drago still has
his fire demon chi!

333
00:18:58,204 --> 00:19:01,139
Uncle: Removal spell
was for <i> wind</i> demon chi

334
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:03,174
not <i> fire</i> demon chi.

335
00:19:03,176 --> 00:19:05,610
Pay attention!

336
00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:08,746
Finn: Uh,
little help here, boss.

337
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:11,048
Drago: Weak and worthless.

338
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,917
You're fired!

339
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:16,287
All: Aaaaah!

340
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,695
Ratso: Uh, anybody
going by the petting zoo?

341
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:30,268
Drago: This isn't over.

342
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:35,072
Jade: Oh, yeah?
Then why are you
running away?

343
00:19:35,074 --> 00:19:38,709
Uncle: Because drago knows
6 other demons

344
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:43,047
were defeated by
immortal warriors
in ancient times.

345
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:45,850
Tohru: Which means
6 more immortal relics

346
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:48,286
will have traces of
demon chi on them...

347
00:19:48,288 --> 00:19:50,988
Jackie: And drago
will be seeking them all.

348
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,990
Jade: So we'll just
have to find them first.

349
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:55,660
Uncle: Or entire world

350
00:19:55,662 --> 00:19:58,663
will be under drago's claw.

351
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,141
Jade: Hey, Jackie, in your own
words, what is chi?

352
00:20:10,143 --> 00:20:11,609
Jackie chan:
Everything is about chi.

353
00:20:11,611 --> 00:20:13,945
It's about...(Exhales)

354
00:20:13,947 --> 00:20:16,447
You're doing this kind of--

355
00:20:16,449 --> 00:20:18,783
(whooping)
