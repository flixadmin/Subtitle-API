1
00:00:00,652 --> 00:00:02,036
Previously,
on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:02,038 --> 00:00:06,125
If I only knew how
you were spending your nights.

3
00:00:06,647 --> 00:00:08,163
Why should I trust you?!

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,234
Oliver.

5
00:00:12,236 --> 00:00:13,952
I thought it was past time we talked.
About what?

6
00:00:13,954 --> 00:00:15,204
You being
a serial killer?

7
00:00:15,206 --> 00:00:16,755
Let's start with Laurel,

8
00:00:16,757 --> 00:00:18,290
since you're still in love with her.
So are you.

9
00:00:18,292 --> 00:00:20,342
Lord knows that I am guilty
of a lot of things

10
00:00:20,344 --> 00:00:24,430
between us, but not you
and her. She chose you.

11
00:00:24,432 --> 00:00:25,881
My name is Moira Dearden Queen.

12
00:00:25,883 --> 00:00:28,350
I'm the CEO
of Queen Consolidated.

13
00:00:28,352 --> 00:00:30,614
I have been complicit
in an undertaking

14
00:00:30,639 --> 00:00:32,305
with one horrible purpose--

15
00:00:32,306 --> 00:00:34,506
to destroy the Glades
and everyone in it.

16
00:00:34,508 --> 00:00:37,609
But you need to know that
the architect of this nightmare

17
00:00:37,611 --> 00:00:39,194
is Malcolm Merlyn.

18
00:00:39,196 --> 00:00:41,029
You can't
beat me, Oliver,

19
00:00:41,031 --> 00:00:42,981
'cause you don't
know in your heart

20
00:00:42,983 --> 00:00:44,700
what you're
fighting for.

21
00:00:44,702 --> 00:00:47,069
Is Laurel safe?
Yeah, you saved her.

22
00:00:47,071 --> 00:00:49,571
No. Tommy...

23
00:00:49,573 --> 00:00:51,874
It should
have been me.

24
00:01:21,722 --> 00:01:22,905
Felicity,
if you're so scared,

25
00:01:22,907 --> 00:01:24,106
why did you insist
on sitting up front?

26
00:01:24,108 --> 00:01:25,507
This is the only seat
with a seatbelt.

27
00:01:25,509 --> 00:01:27,276
Which will come in handy
when we hit the water

28
00:01:27,278 --> 00:01:29,495
at 180 miles an hour.

29
00:01:29,497 --> 00:01:31,497
Which will not happen.

30
00:01:33,751 --> 00:01:36,919
I think that means
we're here.

31
00:01:38,838 --> 00:01:41,006
Lian Yu.

32
00:01:44,577 --> 00:01:46,745
But...You said the parachutes
were just in case!

33
00:01:46,747 --> 00:01:48,297
Yeah, just in case
we made it here.

34
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:49,932
Come on.
No!

35
00:01:55,939 --> 00:01:57,923
All right,
Felicity, on 3!

36
00:01:57,925 --> 00:02:00,359
I can't, I'm scared! I can't--
1!

37
00:02:10,287 --> 00:02:13,205
Thanks for waiting
until we touched down.

38
00:02:13,207 --> 00:02:15,440
My pleasure.

39
00:02:15,442 --> 00:02:17,626
Let's move.

40
00:02:35,728 --> 00:02:37,963
What is it?

41
00:02:37,965 --> 00:02:41,149
Thought I heard something.

42
00:02:46,323 --> 00:02:48,523
Dig!

43
00:02:52,028 --> 00:02:53,979
Don't move.

44
00:02:58,818 --> 00:03:02,004
It's a landmine.
I'm going to try to disarm it.

45
00:03:02,006 --> 00:03:03,989
You can't!

46
00:03:06,009 --> 00:03:08,159
Diggle! Walk away.

47
00:03:08,161 --> 00:03:11,163
Felicity, don't move.

48
00:03:23,226 --> 00:03:26,945
God, you're--
you're really sweaty.

49
00:03:26,947 --> 00:03:30,232
You're a hard man to find.

50
00:03:30,234 --> 00:03:32,951
You shouldn't have
come here.

51
00:03:39,876 --> 00:03:43,495
Would have emailed,
but this isn't exactly a WiFi hotspot.

52
00:03:43,497 --> 00:03:45,213
Is this where you lived when
you were here?

53
00:03:45,215 --> 00:03:48,133
I mean, the first time
you were here.

54
00:03:48,135 --> 00:03:50,502
For some of it.

55
00:03:50,504 --> 00:03:53,305
Could you at least pretend
like you're glad to see us?

56
00:03:53,307 --> 00:03:55,340
Dig and I spent weeks
tracking you down.

57
00:03:55,342 --> 00:03:56,892
We've traveled
halfway across the world.

58
00:03:56,894 --> 00:03:58,644
And this morning
we flew in a plane so old,

59
00:03:58,646 --> 00:04:00,595
I'm pretty sure I was safer once
I jumped out of it.

60
00:04:00,597 --> 00:04:02,981
You could...at least
offer us a water.

61
00:04:02,983 --> 00:04:05,600
Or...

62
00:04:05,602 --> 00:04:08,270
A coconut.

63
00:04:09,772 --> 00:04:12,891
Fresh out of coconuts.

64
00:04:14,226 --> 00:04:16,328
I am happy to see you.

65
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:18,747
But I know why you're here.

66
00:04:18,749 --> 00:04:21,583
I'm not coming back
to Starling City.

67
00:04:21,585 --> 00:04:23,742
I can't. My mission,

68
00:04:23,767 --> 00:04:25,672
my father's list,
it was a fool's crusade.

69
00:04:25,673 --> 00:04:27,923
And I failed.

70
00:04:27,925 --> 00:04:30,075
Malcolm Merlyn
destroyed the Glades.

71
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,845
Tommy died.

72
00:04:33,847 --> 00:04:37,382
And the Hood couldn't stop it.

73
00:04:37,384 --> 00:04:40,936
So don't ask me
to put it on again.

74
00:04:40,938 --> 00:04:43,755
Ever.

75
00:04:45,141 --> 00:04:47,559
This isn't about you
being the Vigilante.

76
00:04:47,561 --> 00:04:50,095
This is about you
being Oliver Queen.

77
00:04:50,097 --> 00:04:52,948
Your mother's
in prison, Oliver.

78
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,733
Her trial's
coming up.

79
00:04:54,735 --> 00:04:57,285
Thea's out
on her own.

80
00:04:57,287 --> 00:04:58,603
Your family
needs you.

81
00:04:58,605 --> 00:05:00,438
So does the family business.

82
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,107
All the bad press
after the Undertaking

83
00:05:02,109 --> 00:05:04,292
left Queen Consolidated
ripe for a hostile takeover

84
00:05:04,294 --> 00:05:05,944
by Stellmoor International.

85
00:05:05,946 --> 00:05:08,296
They've gutted every company
they've taken over.

86
00:05:08,298 --> 00:05:09,664
Once they gobble up
Queen Consolidated,

87
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:11,616
30,000 employees are going
to be out of a job.

88
00:05:11,618 --> 00:05:15,754
Including one very blond
I.T. expert.

89
00:05:15,756 --> 00:05:17,789
Listen, I get why you
had to leave, Oliver,

90
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:19,674
probably better
than anybody else.

91
00:05:19,676 --> 00:05:21,927
I've been there.

92
00:05:21,929 --> 00:05:24,479
And after what happened,
nobody can blame you for leaving.

93
00:05:27,183 --> 00:05:29,351
But it's time
to come home.

94
00:05:51,157 --> 00:05:54,092
You're not the first man
to learn the hard way--

95
00:05:54,094 --> 00:05:56,828
women are a distraction.

96
00:05:58,714 --> 00:06:00,999
You've come very far
in a few months.

97
00:06:01,001 --> 00:06:03,018
Don't beat yourself up.

98
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,687
Ah, apparently that's his job.
And I love my job.

99
00:06:05,689 --> 00:06:08,006
Not that I wouldn't trade it
for a way off this island.

100
00:06:08,008 --> 00:06:10,609
While you two were playing
with each other, I was hunting.

101
00:06:10,611 --> 00:06:14,029
Well, there's nothing more attractive
than a woman who can hunt.

102
00:06:14,031 --> 00:06:17,365
When I was marooned here,
my first meal was a pheasant.

103
00:06:17,367 --> 00:06:19,151
Your father cooked it for me.

104
00:06:19,153 --> 00:06:22,037
He was an awful cook.
Yeah.

105
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:23,038
But a great father.

106
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,873
I'm looking at the proof.

107
00:06:27,043 --> 00:06:28,743
Let's eat.

108
00:06:31,632 --> 00:06:33,081
What's that?

109
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:36,218
That's Fyers'
proximity detector.

110
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:39,087
We salvaged it from the wreckage
of the soldier's camp.

111
00:06:39,089 --> 00:06:41,223
Picks up anything moving
outside our safe zone.

112
00:06:41,225 --> 00:06:44,226
It's been five months
since we stopped Fyers.

113
00:06:44,228 --> 00:06:46,094
He and all of his men
were dead.

114
00:06:46,196 --> 00:06:48,496
So maybe it's an animal.

115
00:06:48,498 --> 00:06:50,982
There's an imaging
interface.

116
00:06:52,201 --> 00:06:53,484
Those are not animals.

117
00:06:53,486 --> 00:06:56,171
And we're not alone
on this island.

118

Who's blood?

121
00:07:23,533 --> 00:07:26,684
An alderman from the Glades
trying to save the city.

122
00:07:26,686 --> 00:07:28,653
Fill your shoes.

123
00:07:28,655 --> 00:07:31,906
Here's everything
on Stellmoor International.

124
00:07:31,908 --> 00:07:34,209
The vice president
of acquisitions

125
00:07:34,211 --> 00:07:37,295
is a woman named Isabel Rochev.

126
00:07:38,247 --> 00:07:40,698
She looks angry
in every photo.

127
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,051
So where to?
Office?

128
00:07:43,053 --> 00:07:47,088
Home. I want
to check in on Thea.

129
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,873
Uh, she's not
at your house, Oliver.

130
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:50,925
Where is she?

131
00:07:56,215 --> 00:07:58,683
I only have a second.

132
00:07:58,685 --> 00:08:00,852
That's ok, my boss has been
all over my ass today.

133
00:08:00,854 --> 00:08:02,988
You should hear what
she sounds like when--

134
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,939
Ow!

135
00:08:04,941 --> 00:08:08,559
You have got to be kidding me!

136
00:08:08,561 --> 00:08:10,662
Come on! I don't
want to fight.

137
00:08:10,664 --> 00:08:12,107
Clearly you do,

138
00:08:12,132 --> 00:08:13,883
since you keep on taking
every street corner drug dealer

139
00:08:13,884 --> 00:08:15,500
that you can get your fists on.

140
00:08:15,502 --> 00:08:17,452
It's not like that.
The Glades are worse than ever.

141
00:08:17,454 --> 00:08:19,537
I know, but you already
saved a busload of people

142
00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:21,790
and managed not to get
buried alive.

143
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:24,876
I mean, how much more
of a hero do you need to be?

144
00:08:24,878 --> 00:08:27,712
It's like you have
a death wish.

145
00:08:27,714 --> 00:08:30,548
And guess what--
it's going to come true.

146
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,600
Yeah, well, someone
has to do something.

147
00:08:32,602 --> 00:08:35,103
And stand up for what's
right, like he did.

148
00:08:35,105 --> 00:08:37,272
The Vigilante.

149
00:08:37,274 --> 00:08:40,025
Who hasn't been seen
since the earthquake,

150
00:08:40,027 --> 00:08:42,694
which means he did get
buried alive and isn't coming back.

151
00:08:42,696 --> 00:08:44,863
I'm back.

152
00:08:44,865 --> 00:08:47,432
Ollie!

153
00:08:48,934 --> 00:08:50,902
Ah, you remember
my friend Roy.

154
00:08:50,904 --> 00:08:53,955
Still here?
Always.

155
00:08:53,957 --> 00:08:56,124
So how was Europe?

156
00:08:56,126 --> 00:08:58,543
You never texted,
no postcards.

157
00:08:58,545 --> 00:09:00,628
Almost like you're
on the island all over again.

158
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:02,580
Yeah, sorry,
I was kind of distracted.

159
00:09:02,582 --> 00:09:03,998
With snow skiing,
waterskiing.

160
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,667
A lot of skiing.

161
00:09:05,669 --> 00:09:08,119
I hear rumors that my club
is under new management.

162
00:09:08,121 --> 00:09:09,804
Ah, actually,
it's my club now,

163
00:09:09,806 --> 00:09:11,473
and you're not
getting it back.

164
00:09:11,475 --> 00:09:12,924
You're not old enough to drink.

165
00:09:12,926 --> 00:09:15,009
But I am old enough
to run a bar.

166
00:09:15,011 --> 00:09:17,312
Have you made it
to Iron Heights?

167
00:09:17,314 --> 00:09:20,465
To visit the woman
who dropped a city

168
00:09:20,467 --> 00:09:24,018
on 500 innocent people?
No, thank you.

169
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:27,238
Thea...That's not what mom did.

170
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,324
Right.

171
00:09:29,326 --> 00:09:31,642
She had no choice.

172
00:09:31,644 --> 00:09:34,446
But guess what?
She did.

173
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:37,165
A choice not to be
a mass murderer.

174
00:09:37,167 --> 00:09:39,334
And I have
a choice, too.

175
00:09:39,336 --> 00:09:41,536
So I choose not
to be her daughter.

176
00:09:41,538 --> 00:09:44,089
But I am so happy
you are home.

177
00:09:44,091 --> 00:09:46,674
Honestly, I need to deal
with our liquor distributor

178
00:09:46,676 --> 00:09:48,877
who shorted me
on yesterday's delivery,

179
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:52,997
and one of my bartenders
called in sick, so...

180
00:09:52,999 --> 00:09:54,432
What?

181
00:09:54,434 --> 00:09:56,334
Nothing. It's--

182
00:09:56,336 --> 00:09:58,436
it's nice to see you
like this.

183
00:09:58,438 --> 00:10:00,255
Like what?

184
00:10:00,257 --> 00:10:02,807
Together.

185
00:10:02,809 --> 00:10:04,776
The representative
from Central City

186
00:10:04,778 --> 00:10:07,562
says construction on the
Star Labs particle accelerator

187
00:10:07,564 --> 00:10:10,348
should be completed
by Christmas.

188
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,534
And in local news,
billionaire Oliver Queen

189
00:10:12,536 --> 00:10:15,320
has returned once again
to Starling City.

190
00:10:15,322 --> 00:10:16,854
With his mother's upcoming

191
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:19,107
trial and his father's
company in freefall,

192
00:10:19,476 --> 00:10:21,017
analysts are asking what

193
00:10:21,042 --> 00:10:23,627
the Queen family scion
has planned next.

194
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:28,883
Wasn't our country  founded
on a brand of vigilantism, Mr. Donner?

195
00:10:28,885 --> 00:10:30,585
The revolutionaries
in the Boston Tea Party

196
00:10:30,587 --> 00:10:33,204
were certainly choosing
justice over law.

197
00:10:33,206 --> 00:10:36,224
I'd hardly compare our founding fathers
to the Hood, Mr. Mayor,

198
00:10:36,226 --> 00:10:39,093
or these twisted copycats
who have risen in his wake.

199
00:10:39,095 --> 00:10:41,179
Ms. Lance.

200
00:10:41,181 --> 00:10:43,982
What do you think
about vigilantes?

201
00:10:43,984 --> 00:10:46,267
I'd be foolish to disagree
with my new boss.

202
00:10:46,269 --> 00:10:48,153
I knew I was smart
to hire you.

203
00:10:48,155 --> 00:10:50,939
I'd heard you joined
the district attorney's office.

204
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,407
It was time for a change.

205
00:10:52,409 --> 00:10:54,225
Still, I'm sorry that
you and your colleagues

206
00:10:54,227 --> 00:10:56,778
at CNRI won't be opening
your doors again.

207
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,580
There were no doors left
to be reopened.

208
00:10:58,582 --> 00:11:01,566
They're playing
my song.

209
00:11:06,338 --> 00:11:09,040
Good evening.

210
00:11:09,042 --> 00:11:12,210
It has been a very difficult
year for Starling City.

211
00:11:12,212 --> 00:11:15,013
Our losses have been
incalculable,

212
00:11:15,015 --> 00:11:17,298
our grief unimaginable.

213
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:21,052
But with the generous donations
you people are making tonight,

214
00:11:21,054 --> 00:11:23,471
we will come back
from this tragedy.

215
00:11:23,473 --> 00:11:26,941
You have failed
this city, Mr. Mayor!

216
00:11:26,943 --> 00:11:29,444
The Glades descended
into hell on your watch!

217
00:11:29,446 --> 00:11:33,147
You swore to protect
all the citizens of Starling,

218
00:11:33,149 --> 00:11:34,599
not just the wealthy!

219
00:11:34,601 --> 00:11:36,150
We're sorry
about this, folks.

220
00:11:36,152 --> 00:11:38,319
We'll have this sorted
out in just a minute.

221
00:12:08,318 --> 00:12:09,567
We are the Hoods.

222
00:12:09,569 --> 00:12:11,352
And what was taken from us,

223
00:12:11,354 --> 00:12:14,522
we will take back.

224
00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:29,059
Laurel!

225
00:12:29,061 --> 00:12:30,594
Dad, I'm fine.

226
00:12:30,596 --> 00:12:32,795
You've got one
very brave daughter there, sir.

227
00:12:32,797 --> 00:12:35,232
Yeah, one daughter's right,
and I can't stand to lose another.

228
00:12:35,234 --> 00:12:36,799
Well, I still can't believe
this happened.

229
00:12:36,801 --> 00:12:38,351
The hoods attacks
have strictly been limited

230
00:12:38,353 --> 00:12:39,969
to people
in the financial sector

231
00:12:39,971 --> 00:12:42,572
trying to redistribute
wealth in the Glades at gunpoint.

232
00:12:42,574 --> 00:12:44,441
Yeah, well, clearly
that's not getting the result

233
00:12:44,443 --> 00:12:46,109
they're looking for,
is it?

234
00:12:46,111 --> 00:12:47,444
Did you get a good look
at any of them?

235
00:12:47,446 --> 00:12:48,778
It was hard to focus
on anything other

236
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,530
than the gun barrel
pointed at my face.

237
00:12:50,532 --> 00:12:52,265
No tattoos,
distinguishing marks?

238
00:12:52,267 --> 00:12:53,983
What do you think
you're doing?

239
00:12:53,985 --> 00:12:56,403
Interviewing the witness
is the job of the Detective.

240
00:12:56,405 --> 00:12:58,154
Officer Lance.

241
00:12:58,156 --> 00:13:00,624
This is my daughter.
She was nearly killed tonight.

242
00:13:00,626 --> 00:13:02,425
Well, as a parent,
you're welcome to stay.

243
00:13:02,427 --> 00:13:04,827
But as a beat cop,
you're more than free to go.

244
00:13:06,797 --> 00:13:09,132
You know, that's one
of the downsides of being demoted--

245
00:13:09,134 --> 00:13:12,018
I don't get to witness
his sunny disposition on a daily basis.

246
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,337
Dad, give me a sec.

247
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:16,022
Yeah.

248
00:13:18,509 --> 00:13:20,360
I didn't know
you were back in town.

249
00:13:20,362 --> 00:13:21,828
I just got back
a little while ago,

250
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:24,397
and I was going to call,
but then I...

251
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,199
Saw you on TV,
so I thought

252
00:13:26,201 --> 00:13:28,351
that I would come
and make sure you were safe.

253
00:13:28,353 --> 00:13:31,204
Just four hooded gunmen.

254
00:13:31,206 --> 00:13:34,524
Nothing a few self-defense
classes couldn't handle.

255
00:13:34,526 --> 00:13:37,043
Take a walk?
Yeah.

256
00:13:38,412 --> 00:13:41,047
Sorry I left.

257
00:13:41,049 --> 00:13:44,751
Believe me, I get it.

258
00:13:44,753 --> 00:13:47,254
After the funeral,
I think we both needed time

259
00:13:47,256 --> 00:13:49,222
to figure things out.

260
00:13:49,224 --> 00:13:50,590
On our own.

261
00:13:50,592 --> 00:13:52,559
I didn't get
very far on my own.

262
00:13:52,561 --> 00:13:54,644
Did you?

263
00:13:54,646 --> 00:13:57,314
Figure anything out?

264
00:13:57,316 --> 00:14:00,767
That I made a mistake...

265
00:14:00,769 --> 00:14:02,902
when I slept with you.

266
00:14:02,904 --> 00:14:05,722
I know it wasn't
exactly cheating,

267
00:14:05,724 --> 00:14:07,958
because Tommy
had broken up with me,

268
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,010
but he only did that
because he thought

269
00:14:10,012 --> 00:14:13,363
that you and I...
should be together.

270
00:14:13,365 --> 00:14:17,317
All I know is that I feel
like I betrayed him.

271
00:14:19,253 --> 00:14:22,238
And now he's gone.

272
00:14:23,641 --> 00:14:26,326
And there's nothing I can do
to make it right.

273
00:14:26,328 --> 00:14:30,113
I know how that feels.

274
00:14:30,115 --> 00:14:33,016
When I brought your sister on
"the Queen's Gambit,"

275
00:14:33,018 --> 00:14:35,135
I betrayed you

276
00:14:35,137 --> 00:14:38,638
and your father.

277
00:14:39,957 --> 00:14:41,658
There's no forgiveness

278
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:45,145
for what I led
Sara into.

279
00:14:47,148 --> 00:14:49,599
I would give
anything to...

280
00:14:52,269 --> 00:14:54,871
To go back.

281
00:14:54,873 --> 00:14:57,791
Yeah.

282
00:14:57,793 --> 00:15:00,943
But we can't go back.

283
00:15:13,391 --> 00:15:14,974
Diggle!

284
00:15:14,976 --> 00:15:17,010
I don't like
being played.

285
00:15:17,012 --> 00:15:18,294
I'm not sure
what you mean.

286
00:15:18,296 --> 00:15:19,646
That's why you came
to the island

287
00:15:19,648 --> 00:15:21,297
and brought me back
to Starling City--

288
00:15:21,299 --> 00:15:22,899
these hood copycats.

289
00:15:22,901 --> 00:15:24,517
Well, what if it was?

290
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:26,152
They're just doing
what you did last year,

291
00:15:26,154 --> 00:15:27,937
terrorizing one-percenters
into cleaning up their act.

292
00:15:27,939 --> 00:15:30,657
Except they don't have
your restraint, Oliver.

293
00:15:30,659 --> 00:15:32,659
Or your honor.

294
00:15:32,661 --> 00:15:34,694
I'm done being
the Vigilante.

295
00:15:34,696 --> 00:15:36,496
Maybe this town
still needs a vigilante.

296
00:15:36,498 --> 00:15:39,866
Now there's four of them.
How's that working?

297
00:15:41,419 --> 00:15:43,820
Please take me home.

298
00:15:43,822 --> 00:15:46,172
Got a big day at
the office tomorrow

299
00:15:46,174 --> 00:15:49,158
trying to save
my family's company.

300
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,160
Absolutely.

301
00:15:51,162 --> 00:15:53,663
Mr. Queen.

302
00:15:58,135 --> 00:16:00,336
And in local news,

303
00:16:00,338 --> 00:16:01,940
billionaire Oliver Queen

304
00:16:01,965 --> 00:16:04,252
has returned once again
to Starling City.

305
00:16:04,393 --> 00:16:06,476
Unbelievable.

306
00:16:06,478 --> 00:16:09,529
We off the mayor
on live TV,

307
00:16:09,531 --> 00:16:11,614
and what's the local
news keep showing?

308
00:16:11,616 --> 00:16:15,151
Oliver Queen. Why?

309
00:16:15,153 --> 00:16:16,870
Guess he's taking over
the family business.

310
00:16:16,872 --> 00:16:19,205
We've been going
about this wrong.

311
00:16:19,207 --> 00:16:21,875
What do you mean?
If we want real payback,

312
00:16:21,877 --> 00:16:25,378
we got to take the fight
to the name that did this to us.

313
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,696
Queen?

314
00:16:26,698 --> 00:16:27,764
Yeah.

315
00:16:27,766 --> 00:16:30,500
He's some useless brat.

316
00:16:30,502 --> 00:16:34,971
The applied sciences
division of Queen Consolidated

317
00:16:34,973 --> 00:16:37,307
built the earthquake generator.

318
00:16:37,309 --> 00:16:40,710
If we want real justice...

319
00:16:40,712 --> 00:16:43,074
Then that family has

320
00:16:43,099 --> 00:16:45,228
to pay for the suffering
it's caused us.

321
00:16:46,767 --> 00:16:49,269
In full.

322
00:16:49,271 --> 00:16:52,071
Hello, earth to Queen.

323
00:16:52,073 --> 00:16:54,107
What, did you drop a Vertigo
when I wasn't looking?

324
00:16:54,109 --> 00:16:56,359
I was
just distracted.

325
00:16:56,361 --> 00:16:59,529
About what your brother said,
about your mom?

326
00:16:59,531 --> 00:17:01,915
Eavesdrop much?
Ah, what I lack in height,

327
00:17:01,917 --> 00:17:03,666
I make up
for in wicked good hearing.

328
00:17:03,668 --> 00:17:05,535
Well,

329
00:17:05,537 --> 00:17:07,754
don't keep me
in suspense, Harper.

330
00:17:07,756 --> 00:17:09,255
What's your take on the matter?

331
00:17:09,257 --> 00:17:11,925
Though, keep in mind,
I do control your paycheck

332
00:17:11,927 --> 00:17:13,259
and your sex life.

333
00:17:13,261 --> 00:17:15,011
Well,

334
00:17:15,013 --> 00:17:18,264
both my parents weren't worth
a damn, either of them.

335
00:17:18,266 --> 00:17:19,749
You never talk about them.

336
00:17:19,751 --> 00:17:21,918
You got nothing nice
to say, right?

337
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,720
Still, I--

338
00:17:23,722 --> 00:17:28,191
I'd be glad to see
them and talk to them if I could.

339
00:17:28,193 --> 00:17:29,776
But...

340
00:17:29,778 --> 00:17:32,261
Look, you already
lost your dad.

341
00:17:32,263 --> 00:17:34,047
Your mom,
she's still here,

342
00:17:34,049 --> 00:17:36,166
and I'm sure she'd
love to see you.

343
00:17:36,168 --> 00:17:38,952
I'm sure she's dying to.

344
00:17:38,954 --> 00:17:41,738
Just like a lot of mothers
in the Glades

345
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:45,241
who won't ever get to see
their kids again...

346
00:17:45,243 --> 00:17:48,161
Because my mother
helped kill them.

347
00:17:48,163 --> 00:17:51,581
I'm not going to that prison.

348
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:56,252
It's the only way
I know how to hurt her.

349
00:17:56,254 --> 00:18:00,006
You might want to consider
how much it's hurting you.

350
00:18:09,266 --> 00:18:11,634
They're in the conference
room. Just fyi,

351
00:18:11,636 --> 00:18:13,970
no one is eating the bagels.

352
00:18:15,823 --> 00:18:18,324
Isabel Rochev.
Oliver Queen.

353
00:18:18,326 --> 00:18:20,026
Sorry I'm late.
For this meeting

354
00:18:20,028 --> 00:18:21,444
or a career in business?

355
00:18:21,446 --> 00:18:22,862
I didn't realize
hostile takeovers

356
00:18:22,864 --> 00:18:24,664
were filled with
so much hostility.

357
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:26,366
Not at all. I'm actually
in quite a good mood.

358
00:18:26,368 --> 00:18:28,317
Really?
So destroying companies

359
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:30,003
agrees with you?
Winning agrees with me.

360
00:18:30,005 --> 00:18:32,321
You haven't won yet.

361
00:18:32,323 --> 00:18:35,625
Since you majored
in dropping out of college,

362
00:18:35,627 --> 00:18:37,961
let me put this in terms
that are easy for you to understand.

363
00:18:37,963 --> 00:18:40,463
You control 45%
of Queen Consolidated stock.

364
00:18:40,465 --> 00:18:43,383
I control 45%,
leaving 10% outstanding.

365
00:18:43,385 --> 00:18:46,486
But, in two days the board
will release the final 10%.

366
00:18:46,488 --> 00:18:48,771
And I'll buy it
before you do.

367
00:18:48,773 --> 00:18:50,557
With what money?

368
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,675
I doubt your trust fund
is that large,

369
00:18:52,677 --> 00:18:54,844
and no angel investor
will go near the company

370
00:18:54,846 --> 00:18:56,863
that build the machine
that destroyed half the city.

371
00:18:56,865 --> 00:18:59,866
Companies rise and fall,
Mr. Queen.

372
00:18:59,868 --> 00:19:02,418
Your company has fallen.

373
00:19:11,695 --> 00:19:13,296
Oliver Queen!

374
00:19:13,298 --> 00:19:16,049
You failed this city.

375
00:19:24,758 --> 00:19:26,926
Pull back!

376
00:19:28,228 --> 00:19:30,763
Oliver, go!
Go, go, go, go!

377
00:19:30,765 --> 00:19:33,433
Careful. Go, go.

378
00:19:39,556 --> 00:19:41,142
Quick! They're getting away.

379
00:19:41,167 --> 00:19:42,512
Go! Move!

380
00:20:10,641 --> 00:20:13,810
Ms. Rochev,
I'm sorry about this.

381
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:15,579
'Cause they were
after you?

382
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:17,998
Because what happens
in this building is my responsibility.

383
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,667
Only for the next
48 hours.

384
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:26,006
I still can't get used to you
in that uniform, Detective Lance.

385
00:20:26,008 --> 00:20:27,958
It's "Officer" now.

386
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,043
And I'm just glad
it still fits.

387
00:20:30,045 --> 00:20:31,044
They hurt you?

388
00:20:31,046 --> 00:20:33,180
I'm ok.

389
00:20:33,182 --> 00:20:37,667
You, uh, heard anything from
our mutual friend lately?

390
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:39,636
Nope.

391
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:44,725
In fact...I keep
waiting for him to show up.

392
00:20:44,727 --> 00:20:46,360
You could have
stopped those guys.

393
00:20:46,362 --> 00:20:48,178
Not without
giving Isabel Rochev

394
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,747
and the hoods a pretty good
idea of what I'm capable of.

395
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,232
I think what
Felicity's wondering

396
00:20:52,234 --> 00:20:54,017
is whether you avoided
taking those hoods on.

397
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:55,702
And, Oliver, she's not
the only one wondering.

398
00:20:55,704 --> 00:20:58,005
I told you, I did not come back
to Starling City

399
00:20:58,007 --> 00:20:59,590
to be the Vigilante.

400
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,074
But they came
after you, Oliver.

401
00:21:01,076 --> 00:21:02,209
You could have
taken them out.

402
00:21:02,211 --> 00:21:04,244
No, I couldn't,
Diggle.

403
00:21:04,246 --> 00:21:06,363
Look, there's a part
of being the Hood

404
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:10,751
that neither
one of you are considering.

405
00:21:10,753 --> 00:21:12,386
The body count.

406
00:21:12,388 --> 00:21:15,389
And excuse me
for saying this,

407
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:18,308
but so what?
Since when do you care?

408
00:21:20,211 --> 00:21:23,897
Since Tommy.

409
00:21:25,567 --> 00:21:30,404
After he found out my secret,
you know what Tommy called me?

410
00:21:30,406 --> 00:21:32,656
A murderer.

411
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:34,724
He was right.

412
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:37,494
My best friend
died thinking

413
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:39,913
that I was a murderer,

414
00:21:39,915 --> 00:21:41,915
and anyone that I kill

415
00:21:41,917 --> 00:21:44,618
dishonors his memory.

416
00:21:46,171 --> 00:21:48,288
So don't.

417
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:51,458
It's not like you've killed
every guy you've faced.

418
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,377
I could have.

419
00:21:53,379 --> 00:21:55,012
Because when I
put on the hood,

420
00:21:55,014 --> 00:21:56,847
it's kill or be killed.

421
00:21:56,849 --> 00:22:00,467
That is what
kept me alive.

422
00:22:00,469 --> 00:22:03,804
That's why I should have
stayed on the island.

423
00:22:03,806 --> 00:22:05,639
Is that where
you're going now?

424
00:22:05,641 --> 00:22:08,108
The two of you won't help me
save my family's company,

425
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:10,594
I'm going to talk
to somebody who will.

426
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:16,116
Well, someone's
definitely out there.

427
00:22:16,118 --> 00:22:18,452
They're moving closer.

428
00:22:20,905 --> 00:22:22,439
Where do you think
you're going?

429
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:24,741
Flanking position.
They get the drop on you,

430
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:26,943
you'll want some back-up.

431
00:22:28,964 --> 00:22:31,448
She's teaching you
Chinese. How sweet.

432
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,300
I'm sure she'd be happy
to teach you, too--

433
00:22:33,302 --> 00:22:35,969
Shado!

434
00:23:00,144 --> 00:23:01,478
Hey.

435
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,829
Hey.

436
00:23:02,831 --> 00:23:06,283
I'm sorry I didn't
make it here sooner.

437
00:23:06,285 --> 00:23:09,620
Oh, no, no, no.
Please, Oliver.

438
00:23:09,622 --> 00:23:11,655
There are going to
be enough apologies

439
00:23:11,657 --> 00:23:14,358
with me apologizing
to you for the rest of my life.

440
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,877
You don't have to.

441
00:23:16,879 --> 00:23:20,113
You saved hundreds of lives.

442
00:23:20,115 --> 00:23:22,182
And killed
hundreds more.

443
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:26,436
Including Tommy.

444
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:27,721
That was Malcolm.

445
00:23:27,723 --> 00:23:32,142
Your sister doesn't
see it that way.

446
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:34,678
And, you know,
my attorney is thrilled.

447
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,347
If my own daughter
can't forgive me,

448
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:39,900
she's not too
optimistic about

449
00:23:39,902 --> 00:23:42,369
12 strangers
in a jury box.

450
00:23:44,522 --> 00:23:46,356
All right,
enough of that.

451
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:49,626
How has it been going
at Queen Consolidated?

452
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:54,982
Yes, we do get the news
in here, Oliver.

453
00:23:54,984 --> 00:23:56,049
Right.
You know,

454
00:23:56,051 --> 00:23:57,484
if I'd known the key

455
00:23:57,486 --> 00:23:59,052
to you taking
your rightful place

456
00:23:59,054 --> 00:24:00,520
at the company
was its demise,

457
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:04,040
I would have declared
bankruptcy a year ago.

458
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:07,094
I don't know if I'll get
to run it for long.

459
00:24:07,096 --> 00:24:09,396
Stellmoor.

460
00:24:09,398 --> 00:24:12,182
Their VP
is coming after us hard.

461
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:15,218
Isabel Rochev.
Yes.

462
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:19,690
Do not trust that woman, Oliver.
She is dangerous.

463
00:24:19,692 --> 00:24:23,610
Well, mom, everywhere
I look, there are no good options.

464
00:24:25,246 --> 00:24:27,764
I don't know what to do.

465
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:31,234
You don't have
to do it yourself.

466
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:33,737
This is a family
business.

467
00:24:33,739 --> 00:24:35,255
I love Thea.

468
00:24:35,257 --> 00:24:37,224
I don't think that she wants
anything to do with it.

469
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:40,627
I wasn't talking
about Thea.

470
00:24:51,422 --> 00:24:53,974
Table seven
needs bottle service,

471
00:24:53,976 --> 00:24:56,143
and I need a round
of Martinis on the three top.

472
00:24:56,145 --> 00:24:57,778
You go see
your mom yet?

473
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,429
I thought
about what you said.

474
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:00,614
And?

475
00:25:00,616 --> 00:25:02,532
And...I'll go see her

476
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:05,435
when you stop going out at night
looking to clean up the streets.

477
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:07,404
What does one thing have
to do with the other?

478
00:25:07,406 --> 00:25:10,774
I guess they're both things
that are never going to happen.

479
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:26,289
We're looking
for Oliver Queen!

480
00:25:27,458 --> 00:25:30,894
He's back in town.
He owns this dump.

481
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:33,296
Where can we find him?

482
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:38,018
Ok, then plan "B,"
I'm going to start shooting people

483
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:40,804
until Mr. Queen...

484
00:25:40,806 --> 00:25:43,306
Grows a pair.

485
00:25:44,158 --> 00:25:45,642
Roy!

486
00:25:54,585 --> 00:25:56,486
Aaah!

487
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:58,922
Aah!

488
00:26:08,569 --> 00:26:10,852
Drop off, hero.

489
00:26:10,854 --> 00:26:15,040
I'm just as happy to kill this
Queen as her brother. Let's go!

490
00:26:22,032 --> 00:26:23,715
One of the guys
was missing a hand.

491
00:26:23,717 --> 00:26:24,917
What's going on here?

492
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:26,218
Mostly, anyway.
He still had sutures.

493
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,886
Excuse me. It was
the hoods, again.

494
00:26:27,888 --> 00:26:30,556
They came here looking for you,
they took Thea instead.

495
00:26:30,558 --> 00:26:33,342
Where?
I'm sorry.

496
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:36,061
I really tried
to stop them, but I--

497
00:26:36,063 --> 00:26:38,080
Queen.

498
00:26:38,082 --> 00:26:40,098
Queen!

499
00:26:41,401 --> 00:26:43,352
We'll get your sister back.

500
00:26:43,354 --> 00:26:46,605
I was going to check
something downstairs.

501
00:26:51,945 --> 00:26:53,996
I've made a few
improvements down here.

502
00:26:53,998 --> 00:26:56,064
Just in case, you know...

503
00:26:56,066 --> 00:26:58,417
You decided to come back.

504
00:27:14,434 --> 00:27:17,469
We need to find these guys.

505
00:27:17,471 --> 00:27:19,588
I've been trying,
ever since you got back.

506
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:22,341
I figured you'd come
around eventually.

507
00:27:23,193 --> 00:27:25,477
I kept that.

508
00:27:25,479 --> 00:27:27,596
I liked
watching you do that.

509
00:27:27,598 --> 00:27:31,033
Thea's boyfriend said one of
them was missing part of his hand.

510
00:27:31,035 --> 00:27:33,468
Maybe a veteran?

511
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:36,138
Check hospital records,
any males that have had

512
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:38,123
surgical amputations
on their extremities.

513
00:27:38,125 --> 00:27:40,792
Cross-checking
by race and age.

514
00:27:40,794 --> 00:27:44,296
Got one--Jeff Deveau.
Caucasian, late thirties.

515
00:27:44,298 --> 00:27:46,448
What else can
you get on him?

516
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:47,666
Ex-Marine.

517
00:27:47,668 --> 00:27:49,501
Would explain how he can
handle himself.

518
00:27:49,503 --> 00:27:51,003
Did he lose
his hand overseas?

519
00:27:51,005 --> 00:27:53,222
No. In the earthquake.

520
00:27:53,224 --> 00:27:54,393
Says here he and his wife

521
00:27:54,418 --> 00:27:56,458
were trying to make it
across the 52nd Street bridge

522
00:27:57,394 --> 00:28:00,128
when it collapsed.

523
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:01,963
She didn't make it.

524
00:28:01,965 --> 00:28:05,984
Phone records, please.
I want to know he's in contact with.

525
00:28:07,353 --> 00:28:10,639
He's made a lot of calls
to a church in the Glades.

526
00:28:10,641 --> 00:28:12,641
Something called
Standing Strong.

527
00:28:12,643 --> 00:28:15,160
It's a support group for those
who lost loved ones in the quake.

528
00:28:15,162 --> 00:28:17,529
Great place to meet
three other guys as angry as you,

529
00:28:17,531 --> 00:28:18,980
looking
for a little payback.

530
00:28:18,982 --> 00:28:22,200
Get me an address,
please.

531
00:28:23,503 --> 00:28:26,088
You're going to need this.

532
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:29,508
I had it custom made.

533
00:28:34,764 --> 00:28:36,498
How'd I do?

534
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:42,688
It's perfect.

535
00:28:45,725 --> 00:28:47,526
You were right.

536
00:28:47,528 --> 00:28:49,678
Once I signed on,
I stopped thinking

537
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,180
about all the bodies
you dropped.

538
00:28:52,182 --> 00:28:54,533
Because I knew
that being the Hood

539
00:28:54,535 --> 00:28:59,037
meant occasionally
being a killer.

540
00:29:00,506 --> 00:29:02,857
Maybe there's
another way.

541
00:29:02,859 --> 00:29:06,078
They have my sister.

542
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,382
What other way is there?

543
00:29:21,094 --> 00:29:24,096
What are you doing?
We need to save her.

544
00:29:24,098 --> 00:29:25,931
Listen, kid.

545
00:29:25,933 --> 00:29:29,551
You are not the only one
who cares for her.

546
00:29:29,553 --> 00:29:32,404
But there's a lot of them.
Wait for my signal.

547
00:29:34,557 --> 00:29:37,242
Where
are the graves?

548
00:29:37,244 --> 00:29:40,245
Where are the graves?

549
00:29:40,247 --> 00:29:42,397
I don't know
what you're talking about.

550
00:29:44,568 --> 00:29:46,418
Uhh! Uhh!

551
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:50,339
Tell me.

552
00:29:56,963 --> 00:29:59,464
Oliver, no!

553
00:29:59,466 --> 00:30:01,750
Oliver!

554
00:30:17,769 --> 00:30:19,102
So...

555
00:30:19,104 --> 00:30:20,738
What do you want
to do with her?

556
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,773
We could knock her out,
drop her off somewhere.

557
00:30:22,775 --> 00:30:24,441
Come on. Why don't you
just buy her

558
00:30:24,443 --> 00:30:26,043
a new pair of Pradas
while you're at it?

559
00:30:26,045 --> 00:30:27,494
She's seen our faces.

560
00:30:27,496 --> 00:30:29,613
Look, offing Oliver Queen's
one thing, but his sister?

561
00:30:29,615 --> 00:30:32,132
She's not much older
than my sister was

562
00:30:32,134 --> 00:30:33,950
when she was killed
in the earthquake.

563
00:30:33,952 --> 00:30:36,303
Your sister wasn't killed,
she was murdered.

564
00:30:36,305 --> 00:30:38,972
By her mother.

565
00:30:38,974 --> 00:30:42,793
What we're doing here is justice,
which makes us the heroes.

566
00:30:42,795 --> 00:30:46,530
She didn't kill anybody.

567
00:30:46,532 --> 00:30:48,649
My mother didn't kill anyone.

568
00:30:48,651 --> 00:30:51,518
Malcolm Merlyn
destroyed the Glades.

569
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,220
With mommy's help.

570
00:30:53,222 --> 00:30:55,806
Merlyn killed my father.

571
00:30:55,808 --> 00:30:58,926
She thought he'd kill
my brother, too.

572
00:31:00,245 --> 00:31:02,579
She was afraid of him.

573
00:31:03,915 --> 00:31:06,867
She must have been so afraid.

574
00:31:06,869 --> 00:31:09,620
Just like my wife...

575
00:31:09,622 --> 00:31:14,041
When our house
collapsed on top of her.

576
00:31:14,043 --> 00:31:15,175
Ow!

577
00:31:15,177 --> 00:31:16,993
Get away from her!

578
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:44,705
Let's go.
Please!

579
00:31:44,707 --> 00:31:46,707
Move!

580
00:31:46,709 --> 00:31:48,692
Go, move!
Please!

581
00:31:50,745 --> 00:31:52,379
Let...

582
00:31:52,381 --> 00:31:54,414
Her...

583
00:31:54,416 --> 00:31:55,699
Go.

584
00:31:55,701 --> 00:31:56,967
You want to save her?

585
00:31:56,969 --> 00:31:58,368
There was no justice

586
00:31:58,370 --> 00:31:59,720
for people
like the Queens

587
00:31:59,722 --> 00:32:02,556
till you showed us
how to get it.

588
00:32:02,558 --> 00:32:05,225
You showed us.

589
00:32:08,898 --> 00:32:10,814
Go!

590
00:32:15,737 --> 00:32:18,405
You shoot me, we both die.

591
00:32:18,407 --> 00:32:22,559
You'll drop me
anyway.

592
00:32:22,561 --> 00:32:24,778
I know you.
You're a killer.

593
00:32:32,136 --> 00:32:36,590
Keep it under 40 next time.
Have a good evening.

594
00:32:45,249 --> 00:32:47,083
Do you know who they are?

595
00:32:47,085 --> 00:32:49,186
I think the hoods gives
me a pretty good idea.

596
00:32:49,188 --> 00:32:51,388
Bring them in.

597
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:54,057
Where you been?
Typically when I bring in guys

598
00:32:54,059 --> 00:32:56,109
that you've gone after,
they're a little more dead.

599
00:32:56,111 --> 00:32:58,145
I'm trying another way.

600
00:33:28,501 --> 00:33:31,153
I didn't mean
to disturb you.

601
00:33:31,155 --> 00:33:32,922
I didn't know
that you were here.

602
00:33:32,924 --> 00:33:34,323
I was just...

603
00:33:34,325 --> 00:33:38,143
I come here a lot.

604
00:33:38,145 --> 00:33:39,678
I can go.

605
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,630
No, it's...

606
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:43,766
You don't have to.
It's, uh...

607
00:33:43,768 --> 00:33:46,468
Laurel, I understand.

608
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:50,172
After everything
that's happened, I...

609
00:33:50,174 --> 00:33:53,342
Understand why
we can't be together.

610
00:33:53,344 --> 00:33:56,779
But I still need you
in my life.

611
00:33:59,733 --> 00:34:03,402
We've been through too much
for it to be any other way.

612
00:34:09,743 --> 00:34:13,162
I feel like
I betrayed him, too.

613
00:34:13,164 --> 00:34:15,664
Before the Hood,
we didn't have things

614
00:34:15,666 --> 00:34:18,050
like earthquake machines
or copycat vigilantes--

615
00:34:18,052 --> 00:34:20,369
Laurel.

616
00:34:20,371 --> 00:34:22,471
Malcolm killed Tommy.

617
00:34:22,473 --> 00:34:25,424
He was killed in the crossfire
between two archers.

618
00:34:26,676 --> 00:34:29,378
And now that
Malcolm's dead,

619
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:31,397
there's only
one archer left.

620
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:34,733
And I'm going to help
my boss catch him.

621
00:34:45,228 --> 00:34:48,247
That outfit,
with your coloring--

622
00:34:48,249 --> 00:34:52,084
isn't that cruel and unusual
punishment or something?

623
00:34:52,086 --> 00:34:54,336
I've done my best
to avoid mirrors in here.

624
00:34:56,507 --> 00:34:58,140
So, I--

625
00:34:58,142 --> 00:35:00,709
How have you been?

626
00:35:00,711 --> 00:35:05,931
Don't worry about me.
I want to hear about you.

627
00:35:05,933 --> 00:35:07,967
How are you doing?

628
00:35:09,386 --> 00:35:11,270
Are you still
seeing, uh--

629
00:35:11,272 --> 00:35:14,423
Roy was his name,
wasn't it?

630
00:35:15,809 --> 00:35:19,594
Sweetheart,
I'm fine, really.

631
00:35:19,596 --> 00:35:23,082
It's not that.

632
00:35:23,084 --> 00:35:26,118
I...

633
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,320
I almost died last night.

634
00:35:28,322 --> 00:35:30,539
What?

635
00:35:30,541 --> 00:35:31,957
Thea, what happened?

636
00:35:31,959 --> 00:35:33,659
It doesn't matter.

637
00:35:33,661 --> 00:35:37,429
But when I thought
it was over,

638
00:35:37,431 --> 00:35:39,365
I kept thinking that if...

639
00:35:39,367 --> 00:35:42,801
If I died,

640
00:35:42,803 --> 00:35:46,805
you would spend the rest
of your life thinking that...

641
00:35:46,807 --> 00:35:49,291
I hated you.

642
00:35:51,061 --> 00:35:54,013
And I want to hate you.

643
00:35:54,015 --> 00:35:57,733
I really tried to.

644
00:35:57,735 --> 00:36:00,319
But I can't.

645
00:36:00,321 --> 00:36:02,855
I can't, Mom.

646
00:36:06,693 --> 00:36:10,012
However long I am
in this place,

647
00:36:10,014 --> 00:36:12,247
you have freed me.

648
00:36:16,503 --> 00:36:19,872
If I hug you,
are they going to shoot us?

649
00:36:21,625 --> 00:36:25,827
I'm willing
to risk it if you are.

650
00:36:33,002 --> 00:36:35,971
Oh, shh, shh.

651
00:36:35,973 --> 00:36:38,891
You can't win this.
I now own 50% of the stock.

652
00:36:38,893 --> 00:36:40,609
By tomorrow, I'll have
the outstanding five percent

653
00:36:40,611 --> 00:36:43,162
and I will control your company.

654
00:36:43,164 --> 00:36:44,450
Any attempt to fight me

655
00:36:44,475 --> 00:36:46,499
will lead to litigation
and leave you penniless.

656
00:36:47,068 --> 00:36:49,568
And trust me, poverty
isn't as glamorous

657
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:51,853
as Charles Dickens
made it look.

658
00:36:51,855 --> 00:36:54,689
What if I found someone
to invest new equity capital?

659
00:36:54,691 --> 00:36:56,125
A White Night?

660
00:36:56,127 --> 00:36:57,743
With all due respect,

661
00:36:57,745 --> 00:36:59,912
your last name is now
associated with mass murder.

662
00:36:59,914 --> 00:37:02,081
Even you don't have
that good a friend.

663
00:37:02,083 --> 00:37:04,633
You're right.

664
00:37:04,635 --> 00:37:07,803
I have family.

665
00:37:11,224 --> 00:37:14,226
Mr. Steel. It was
my understanding

666
00:37:14,228 --> 00:37:16,878
that you had
resigned as CEO.

667
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,765
I did. I'm now Chief
Financial Officer

668
00:37:19,767 --> 00:37:21,383
of Starling National Bank.

669
00:37:21,385 --> 00:37:23,402
And my institution
has committed

670
00:37:23,404 --> 00:37:25,888
rescue financing
to Mr. Queen.

671
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:28,357
We bought up the remaining
shares of Queen Consolidated

672
00:37:28,359 --> 00:37:30,409
when they were
released this morning.

673
00:37:30,411 --> 00:37:32,161
Now I know I majored
in dropping out,

674
00:37:32,163 --> 00:37:33,612
but I'm pretty sure that makes
us partners going forward.

675
00:37:33,614 --> 00:37:35,080
So I guess...

676
00:37:35,082 --> 00:37:38,417
We will be seeing
a lot of each other.

677
00:37:38,419 --> 00:37:41,703
You aren't at all
what people say about you.

678
00:37:41,705 --> 00:37:45,240
Most people fail
to see the real me.

679
00:37:54,767 --> 00:37:56,751
Thank you, Walter.

680
00:37:56,753 --> 00:37:59,638
Thank you,
for reaching out to me.

681
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,306
Whatever's happened
between your mother and me,

682
00:38:01,308 --> 00:38:05,444
I'm gratified that you know
you can still count on me.

683
00:38:05,446 --> 00:38:08,030
Your father would have
been very proud of you, Oliver.

684
00:38:13,486 --> 00:38:16,371
Ms. Smoak.
Mr. Steel.

685
00:38:18,658 --> 00:38:20,459
You did it.

686
00:38:20,461 --> 00:38:23,778
Not bad for someone who got
a "D" in tenth grade Algebra.

687
00:38:25,114 --> 00:38:26,965
If it's online,
I can find it.

688
00:38:28,636 --> 00:38:30,719
Yeah.

689
00:38:30,721 --> 00:38:34,789
Well, it was just
like a good friend once told me...

690
00:38:36,125 --> 00:38:38,793
I had to find another way.

691
00:38:52,526 --> 00:38:54,809
We're not alone.

692
00:38:54,811 --> 00:38:58,197
The question is,
where did they come from?

693
00:39:15,165 --> 00:39:16,682
Hey, what's up?

694
00:39:16,684 --> 00:39:18,684
Just came back
from visiting my mom.

695
00:39:18,686 --> 00:39:21,002
Really?
Good for you.

696
00:39:21,004 --> 00:39:22,771
So what do you say?

697
00:39:22,773 --> 00:39:25,674
You ready to start spending
your nights safe with me?

698
00:39:25,676 --> 00:39:27,025
Absolutely.

699
00:39:29,813 --> 00:39:32,197
Hey, I'm going to pick us up
some big belly burger right now.

700
00:39:32,199 --> 00:39:35,450
I'll see you later.
Ok.

701
00:39:37,687 --> 00:39:40,322
We just want
to be friendly.

702
00:39:40,324 --> 00:39:42,291
What, we scare you
or something?

703
00:39:42,293 --> 00:39:45,026
Yeah.
I think you do.

704
00:39:45,028 --> 00:39:47,296
Me, though,
not so much.

705
00:39:47,298 --> 00:39:48,747
Run.

706
00:40:14,724 --> 00:40:17,993
Where the hell
did you come from?

707
00:40:28,738 --> 00:40:31,039
Well, it looks like
Starling is back down

708
00:40:31,041 --> 00:40:32,874
to only one man
in a hood.

709
00:40:32,876 --> 00:40:35,243
And the three of us
are back in the archery business?

710
00:40:35,245 --> 00:40:37,913
No.

711
00:40:37,915 --> 00:40:42,601
I spent the past year
trying to avenge my father.

712
00:40:42,603 --> 00:40:45,420
If we're going to do...this,

713
00:40:45,422 --> 00:40:48,974
it has to be about
honoring Tommy.

714
00:40:48,976 --> 00:40:52,778
I need to become the man
he hoped I could be.

715
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:56,431
You two have helped me
take the first step.

716
00:40:58,985 --> 00:41:01,286
So what's step two?

717
00:41:01,288 --> 00:41:04,606
I'm game for anything as long as
it doesn't involve skydiving.

718
00:41:04,608 --> 00:41:08,327
And I'm pretty down
on landmines now, too.

719
00:41:08,329 --> 00:41:13,298
The city still
needs saving.

720
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:16,251
But not by the Hood.

721
00:41:16,253 --> 00:41:19,838
And not
by some vigilante

722
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,290
who's just crossing
names off a list.

723
00:41:22,292 --> 00:41:24,476
It needs...

724
00:41:24,478 --> 00:41:27,962
Something more.

725
00:41:27,964 --> 00:41:29,815
It needs a hero, Oliver.

726
00:41:29,817 --> 00:41:32,017
It's too bad the hoods kind of
ruined your nickname.

727
00:41:32,019 --> 00:41:35,020
No, it's good. I never...

728
00:41:35,022 --> 00:41:37,989
I don't want to be called
the Hood anymore.

729
00:41:37,991 --> 00:41:40,975
Ok.

730
00:41:43,029 --> 00:41:45,997
So what do you want
to be called?

731
00:41:46,022 --> 00:41:51,022
