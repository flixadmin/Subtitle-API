1
00:00:32,742 --> 00:00:35,202
On the road from Galilee,

2
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:41,834
Christ came upon a beggar
who had thrice been denied alms.

3
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:49,884
Christ asked him if he'd taken before
that which wasn't his.

4
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:57,058
"Yes," the man said. He'd taken
what he felt hadn't been given.

5
00:00:58,601 --> 00:01:01,771
Christ asked him...

6
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:08,027
Christ asked him
where had it left him...

7
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:31,425
Give him some.

8
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:55,950
Boss, I think I know whose car this is.

9
00:02:22,518 --> 00:02:24,979
My name is Pacho Herrera.

10
00:02:26,272 --> 00:02:29,233
I want Gerda Salazar
and her fucking sons delivered to me.

11
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:34,989
Until that happens,
nobody in the North Valley is safe.

12
00:02:35,114 --> 00:02:36,532
Is that clear?

13
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:40,619
Make sure Orlando Henao
gets the message.

14
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:44,707
And now... pray.

15
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:48,210
Pray.

16
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:45,072
<i>...that war is bad for business.</i>

17
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:48,283
Unless it's won.

18
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:51,161
Buenaventura is in Henao's territory.

19
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:55,290
We have to get the port back so we can
maintain our delivery schedules.

20
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,004
You think that... it can be done?

21
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:09,388
Negotiating with the government
and the fucking surrender...

22
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,143
it all means one thing.

23
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:21,066
Our allies and enemies think
we're weak.

24
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:24,153
My brother Gilberto
is responsible for that.

25
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:34,413
- How's Alvaro?
- What do you want me to say, Miguel?

26
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:38,167
The doctors still don't know
if his cock will ever work again.

27
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:41,295
He's 22 years old.

28
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:48,260
I swear to you, Pacho,
the Salazars will pay for that shit.

29
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:14,091
MONASTERY OF EL CARMEN

30
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:32,901
Agent Peña, nice to meet you.
Your reputation precedes you.

31
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:40,761
ANTI-NARCOTIC POLICE

32
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:49,394
<i>I will put in maximum effort,
with all my soul,</i>

33
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,522
<i>into fighting corruption.</i>

34
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:55,942
<i>Because when there is corruption,</i>

35
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:59,237
<i>there is no procedure,
there is no peace of mind.</i>

36
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:13,627
This informant of yours,
is he close to Miguel Rodríguez?

37
00:13:13,752 --> 00:13:16,338
He's provided us with Miguel's location.

38
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:19,090
That's why it's urgent we move now.

39
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:21,927
It may take a miracle
to get this close again.

40
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:24,095
Only God creates miracles.

41
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:29,976
It's for us to use the tools he's bestowed
to resolve these matters.

42
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:35,982
Any chance God's bestowed
the right men to pull off this operation?

43
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:38,527
God has many soldiers.

44
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:44,115
Mine are honest men who answer
to higher powers than you or I.

45
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:47,786
I'm not concerned about them.
But I'm worried about other issues.

46
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:51,081
Gilberto Rodríguez's arrest
has led to new stipulations.

47
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:53,583
From now on, any warrant I sign

48
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:57,254
has to be filed with the local
<i>fiscale</i> office in Cali.

49
00:13:57,379 --> 00:13:59,005
Which the cartel will know about.

50
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:01,883
Possibly.

51
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:06,429
Truth is, your tactics won't be
allowed a second run.

52
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:08,974
Just have to find new ones, General.

53
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:12,853
Your men, General,
where are they now?

54
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:14,813
Awaiting their orders.

55
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:17,899
The target is Miguel Rodríguez.

56
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:22,863
Our operation will succeed
because you fulfil your duty

57
00:14:22,988 --> 00:14:26,324
to your God and to your country,
understood?

58
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:27,909
Yes, sir!

59
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:31,913
The operation from a strategic
point of view is a nightmare.

60
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,665
There's a security perimeter.

61
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:38,128
As soon as the lead team hits the lobby,
the target knows we're inside.

62
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:42,757
Agent Feistl and I will be right
behind you, arriving by helicopter.

63
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:46,970
We'll land on the roof
and come in from above.

64
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:49,055
- We're going to box them in.
- Yes.

65
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,640
We have an inside man.

66
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:54,769
He'll be posted right here,
giving us our best way in.

67
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:05,322
- Which one do you want?
- This one!

68
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:08,742
Okay. Perfect.
Girls, please get ready.

69
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:14,623
Paola... you can't do this.

70
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:17,918
- I'm taking the girls to my parents'.
- Paola, you can't do this.

71
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:19,628
Especially with what's going on
with the cartel.

72
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:21,463
What are you saying?

73
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:25,592
Are you telling me I can't protect
my daughters? Is that what you're saying?

74
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:30,138
No. What I'm saying is that we need
to act normal, like everything is fine.

75
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:33,516
Everything isn't fine, Jorge.
Everything isn't fine.

76
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:35,560
They could be watching
you, me, the girls.

77
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:38,104
Miguel's become paranoid.
Do you understand?

78
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:43,735
I'll call you in a few days.
The girls will want to hear from you.

79
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:47,238
Paola. Please.

80
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:51,785
The Americans are going to try
to arrest Miguel.

81
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,704
I'm going to make sure they succeed.

82
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:57,707
Tomorrow, we will be on a plane.
You, me, the girls.

83
00:15:57,832 --> 00:16:01,670
- We're leaving Colombia.
- Who told you I want to live in the U.S.?

84
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:06,633
Who told you our girls want to leave
the only home they've ever known?

85
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:08,677
So we need to disappear.
Is that your plan?

86
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:11,471
Explain to me again
because I don't get it!

87
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:14,057
What happens if the Americans fail?

88
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:23,024
Paola, please. Please... wait.

89
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,748
Don't leave.

90
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,086
We weren't poor, Jorge.

91
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:48,008
We always had choices.

92
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:53,179
This was your choice.

93
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:08,319
What about the warrant?
You still haven't filed the paperwork.

94
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:12,991
- And we can do nothing without it.
- We're bringing the <i>fiscale</i> with us.

95
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:16,911
Until we're on-site,
no one else knows the real target.

96
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:18,705
Arrest him quickly.

97
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:21,207
Because if word of this gets out,

98
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:23,626
they'll try to stop us
with everything they've got.

99
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:26,588
General...

100
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:28,131
General...

101
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:30,383
One more thing.

102
00:17:31,843 --> 00:17:34,471
I'd like to ask you
to remain in Bogotá.

103
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:38,892
Those are my men.
That's my signature on the warrant.

104
00:17:39,017 --> 00:17:42,020
Which puts your name on the line, sir.

105
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:44,439
If anything goes wrong,
and we look like...

106
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:46,483
Like what? Like idiots?

107
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:50,070
It wouldn't be the first time,
as I understand it.

108
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:53,239
You don't trust me.

109
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:55,950
But you can't do this without me.

110
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:59,871
That's true,
but I know the system we're up against.

111
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:04,459
With your name on the warrant,

112
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:07,045
there's no doubt
the cartel's watching you.

113
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:18,139
As soon as you make the arrest,

114
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:23,728
I'll be the one to lead Miguel Rodríguez
into custody when the press arrive.

115
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:27,774
I'll stay here praying for your success,
because there's no doubt

116
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:30,902
that it's your reputation now on the line.

117
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:16,114
Hi, boss. What's going on?
Getting a little late for you, huh?

118
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:21,035
Just checking in. You run those taps
over in El Lido like I asked?

119
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:24,873
- Yes, sir. Perfect.
- All right. Well done.

120
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:33,256
Enrique, why don't you take off
and I'll keep an eye out here tonight?

121
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:35,675
Is this some kind of test?

122
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:40,263
Someone offers me a day off,
I say yes.

123
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,355
My wife's been hounding me.

124
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:54,235
I could use a night away
from all of her questions, Enrique.

125
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,906
I'm glad I'm not married yet.

126
00:19:58,031 --> 00:20:00,408
Don't make that mistake.

127
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,662
Thank you, boss.

128
00:20:12,587 --> 00:20:14,088
It's Miguel.

129
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:18,384
Don't worry, boss.
I'll hang out until you get back.

130
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:22,764
Good.

131
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:09,686
Miguel's just finishing his call.
Come on in.

132
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:13,856
We can discuss that later.

133
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:18,111
He's here now.

134
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:22,991
Yes, you've said.

135
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:33,418
My son.
You know how he is. A little...

136
00:21:33,543 --> 00:21:35,169
complicated.

137
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:38,006
He's your son.

138
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:11,456
Good things are coming, Jorge.
You'll be part of it.

139
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:15,251
I'm glad, sir.
Is there anything else?

140
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:18,629
Take a seat.

141
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:24,969
You know that my brother...

142
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:28,514
he doesn't like this war thing.

143
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:31,684
He thinks it's a mistake,
being at war with the North Valley.

144
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:37,982
He said this brings too much tension,
with the violence and everything.

145
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:42,111
He's getting counsel from men
I don't trust at all.

146
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:46,240
Those phones that you...

147
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:50,661
What do you call them? Wiretaps?

148
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:53,581
Wiretap.

149
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:55,416
Do you think...

150
00:22:56,793 --> 00:23:00,380
you could put one
on my brother's phone in prison?

151
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:10,306
You want me to tap
Gilberto's phone in prison?

152
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:17,688
For his own good.

153
00:23:19,357 --> 00:23:21,776
Only if it became necessary.

154
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:24,237
So... for him.

155
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:29,283
Of course, sir. Anything you need.

156
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:30,743
Good.

157
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:34,997
- This stays here.
- Of course, sir.

158
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:43,631
Well, I should get back downstairs.
I'm posted outside tonight.

159
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:46,968
You? Nonsense.
You're too old for that!

160
00:23:47,552 --> 00:23:49,637
I don't mind at all. It's part of my job.

161
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:52,974
No. No way.
Have one of the young guys do it.

162
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:57,019
You know, I'm eating late.
Fercho was about to make something.

163
00:23:57,145 --> 00:24:01,190
You'll join us.
You'll join us, Jorge.

164
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:04,277
Fercho, we will be two! Come.

165
00:24:40,897 --> 00:24:42,982
Do you like filets, Jorge?

166
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:44,775
Yes, very much.

167
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:48,196
Hey, I've been meaning to tell you...

168
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:54,702
the building guys,
they've been idling in front of the house.

169
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:56,829
Blocking our exit.

170
00:24:56,954 --> 00:25:00,833
You see that?
Feels good when one's been taken care.

171
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:03,711
Yes. Keep your walkie charged.

172
00:25:04,879 --> 00:25:07,757
And the exits clear, like you said.

173
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:12,803
- You want one?
- Yes, thanks.

174
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:21,979
Look, I have a bottle
of white wine that is...

175
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:25,733
Excuse me, boss, if it's not
too much trouble, I prefer red wine.

176
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:29,737
Okay. It's a shame, but... OK.

177
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:34,450
But I have a really nice bottle
of red wine. I'll bring it. I'll be back.

178
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,173
<i>You're in for a treat tonight.</i>

179
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:54,512
Miguel has me cooking
with these Japanese bread crumbs.

180
00:25:54,637 --> 00:25:57,807
Sounds crazy,
but it's actually more tasty.

181
00:25:57,932 --> 00:25:59,850
That's very interesting.

182
00:25:59,976 --> 00:26:03,771
Hey, Fercho,
looks like the oil's ready.

183
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:05,189
Yes.

184
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:21,205
Boss!

185
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:25,251
We have cars heading towards the building.
I repeat, boss, three trucks with cops...

186
00:26:51,402 --> 00:26:54,155
Gentlemen, by law, I can't let you in.
This is a residence...

187
00:26:57,742 --> 00:26:59,160
A residence?

188
00:27:09,462 --> 00:27:11,589
You hear that?

189
00:27:16,427 --> 00:27:18,512
Enrique!
What the fuck's going on?

190
00:27:18,638 --> 00:27:20,181
How come you didn't inform us
there's a helicopter?

191
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:22,808
- How the fuck did they find us?
- Sir, calm down.

192
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:25,686
We need to get you out of here now.
There's no time to discuss this.

193
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:27,980
- Miguel, what's happening?
- You need to hide.

194
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:30,775
Is there somewhere we can take you?
A <i>caleta</i> in the apartment?

195
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:34,445
Stop. Get to the lobby.
Get to the lobby and stop them.

196
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:37,073
It's better if he goes.
Every second counts.

197
00:27:37,198 --> 00:27:40,076
- Get to the lobby! Stop them.
- María.

198
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:40,428
What the fuck is this?

199
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:12,126
- Are you Fernando Castillo?
- What's this about?

200
00:29:13,461 --> 00:29:15,963
We're here to arrest Miguel Rodríguez.

201
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:17,923
Miguel isn't here.

202
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,441
- There's nothing.
- Look above.

203
00:29:35,566 --> 00:29:36,859
Take that off!

204
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:40,571
Cabinets. There's nothing here.

205
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,032
Try the ones below.

206
00:29:56,212 --> 00:29:58,172
Who's in charge here?

207
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:01,133
I asked you a question.

208
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:04,386
Sorry, sir. We're not authorised
to let anyone inside.

209
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:07,556
You see this fucking badge?

210
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:14,188
Your superiors failed to report
this operation with the local bureau.

211
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:16,232
I'd like to know
who'll be answering for that.

212
00:30:16,357 --> 00:30:18,275
These are direct orders
from my superiors, sir.

213
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,069
Step out of my way.

214
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:25,950
Peinados, stay here.

215
00:30:26,075 --> 00:30:27,910
- Let's go!
- Move!

216
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:31,997
Sergeant, you copy?
The local police are heading up.

217
00:30:37,211 --> 00:30:40,047
Go to the back, please.
You can sit on the couch.

218
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:43,467
How long is this going to take?

219
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:51,517
What are you doing?

220
00:30:53,227 --> 00:30:56,480
Hey, kid. Where is he?
Was Miguel Rodríguez here?

221
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:58,607
Don't speak to my son.

222
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:02,945
Can he please go to his room?
He's just a child.

223
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,822
- Is the room clear?
- Clear.

224
00:31:04,947 --> 00:31:07,616
Okay, leave. Go ahead.

225
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:11,787
Flores.

226
00:31:13,873 --> 00:31:16,208
- Who's in charge here?
- DEA.

227
00:31:18,002 --> 00:31:20,254
I assume with Colombian support.

228
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:24,717
I don't see a ranking officer.

229
00:31:24,842 --> 00:31:27,344
Guess that puts me in charge.

230
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:29,847
There's an exit over there
that leads to the street.

231
00:31:29,972 --> 00:31:32,933
Do you have anyone posted there?
Of course.

232
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:34,894
If you'd properly notified my unit,

233
00:31:35,019 --> 00:31:37,229
we could've blocked that exit
and prevented this escape.

234
00:31:37,354 --> 00:31:39,315
There's no evidence he got out.

235
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,651
That's why you're looking
through the kitchen cabinets?

236
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:58,876
Wake up, man! We have to go.

237
00:32:00,169 --> 00:32:03,464
Let go of her already.
Come on, man!

238
00:32:42,044 --> 00:32:43,879
Don't say a word, brother.

239
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:45,965
We need to put them each
in separate rooms.

240
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:48,509
Fercho. Let's go.

241
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:54,932
To the right.

242
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:07,361
This is messed up, man.

243
00:33:08,696 --> 00:33:12,241
- If your dad's still inside...
- Just drive the fucking car.

244
00:33:57,077 --> 00:34:00,998
<i>We know that agents of the DEA
burst into the building this morning,</i>

245
00:34:01,123 --> 00:34:03,292
<i>just before dawn...</i>

246
00:34:03,417 --> 00:34:06,128
Hey, what did Salcedo say?

247
00:34:07,588 --> 00:34:09,089
Salcedo! What did he say?

248
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:12,342
Sir, the thing is...
no one's heard from him.

249
00:34:12,468 --> 00:34:14,261
Motherfucker!

250
00:34:16,138 --> 00:34:17,973
Do me a favour.

251
00:34:18,098 --> 00:34:20,934
Go to his house and check
what the fuck he's doing

252
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,479
that's more important than this.
Please.

253
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,732
Bye.

254
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:32,780
<i>There's a surreal atmosphere
outside the San Jardîn building.</i>

255
00:34:32,905 --> 00:34:36,283
<i>While curiosity is growing
about the operation</i>

256
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:38,410
<i>and this has grabbed
the attention of the city,</i>

257
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:42,247
<i>it isn't clear who the target
of the operation is.</i>

258
00:34:57,888 --> 00:35:01,642
Good morning, ma'am.
We need to get into your apartment.

259
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:04,770
Help me.

260
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:06,772
- Lift.
- Hold on.

261
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,399
Okay. One, two...

262
00:35:22,663 --> 00:35:24,873
Sir, listen to this.

263
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:34,216
635.

264
00:35:37,845 --> 00:35:39,263
486.

265
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,857
480.

266
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,996
- That's it. Try to control the wrist.
- Okay, let's go.

267
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:47,956
The motherfucker's practising
his backhand.

268
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:49,750
That's it. Try to control it.

269
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:52,836
- Hey! You bastard!
- Hey, fellas. Where are you going?

270
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:55,255
- We're in the middle...
- Who are you talking to, motherfucker?

271
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,383
We're in the middle of a lesson here.
Who are you talking to?

272
00:36:58,508 --> 00:37:00,510
Why the fuck is there a raid going on
at my dad's house,

273
00:37:00,636 --> 00:37:02,638
while you're here having tennis lessons?

274
00:37:02,763 --> 00:37:05,974
David, I don't know what you're
talking about. I don't understand.

275
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:09,478
You're going to go and help
my fucking dad. Now! Understood?

276
00:37:09,603 --> 00:37:14,024
Let's go. Go on. Quickly.
What were you saying?

277
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:16,026
It's fine.

278
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:17,444
Pussy.

279
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:34,962
- Can you set me up?
- Got the perfect shot.

280
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:52,104
You guys can't tear down that wall.
You don't have authorisation.

281
00:37:52,229 --> 00:37:55,565
What are you going to do to stop us?

282
00:39:45,425 --> 00:39:47,386
Stop what you're doing.

283
00:39:48,512 --> 00:39:50,764
As Head of the Attorney General's
office in Cali,

284
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:54,434
I have to insist you put down
that hammer right now.

285
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:56,728
You're currently in violation
of Article 22 of the...

286
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:09,991
As the legal authority in this room,

287
00:40:10,117 --> 00:40:14,746
I demand that you cease and desist
your search of the premises immediately.

288
00:40:23,964 --> 00:40:28,969
Yes, and I'll need your documentation
from the embassy. Your passports.

289
00:40:38,854 --> 00:40:42,441
I'm filing an official complaint
against each of you.

290
00:40:47,904 --> 00:40:50,240
<i>It has now been confirmed
that the search</i>

291
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:52,242
<i>of the San Jardîn building
has been abandoned.</i>

292
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:55,495
<i>Agents from the DEA
along with the Colombian special forces,</i>

293
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,122
<i>have been seen leaving the building.</i>

294
00:40:57,247 --> 00:40:59,541
<i>We can now confirm that
the target of this investigation</i>

295
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:01,960
<i>was in fact cartel godfather
Miguel Rodrîguez.</i>

296
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:05,172
<i>With the search now over
and no arrest made,</i>

297
00:41:05,297 --> 00:41:08,633
<i>questions about the actions of the DEA
and the credibility of their sources</i>

298
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:10,594
<i>will surely arise.</i>

299
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:13,388
<i>It's been a frenetic morning here,</i>

300
00:41:13,513 --> 00:41:17,142
<i>as a great number of police officers
exited the building.</i>

301
00:41:17,267 --> 00:41:20,145
<i>Official word from the National Police
is the search has been abandoned.</i>

302
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:26,151
<i>Now the question is, what evidence
did the DEA have to run this operation?</i>

303
00:41:26,276 --> 00:41:30,155
<i>The U.S. Embassy
hasn't released a statement yet.</i>

304
00:42:02,938 --> 00:42:06,733
It's all good. He's in front of me.
I'm about to tell him.

305
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:11,154
Hey, I just talked to Manny.
They've left the apartment.

306
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:18,537
Okay, good. But my dad isn't safe
until he's here with us. Call Fercho.

307
00:42:18,662 --> 00:42:21,081
- Right.
- Just make sure. You hear me?

308
00:42:21,206 --> 00:42:22,916
Sounds good.

309
00:44:10,482 --> 00:44:12,651
They almost had you today, brother.

310
00:44:14,152 --> 00:44:17,364
- They didn't, Gilberto.
<i>- Thank God.</i>

311
00:44:17,489 --> 00:44:19,491
<i>It's a miracle you got away.</i>

312
00:44:19,616 --> 00:44:22,410
<i>You need to revise
your security network.</i>

313
00:44:24,954 --> 00:44:27,666
Bring this to an end, brother.

314
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:32,504
<i>You have to embrace
that this is the reality we've built.</i>

315
00:44:32,629 --> 00:44:36,966
<i>It's what's best for all.
Accept it, before it's too late.</i>

316
00:44:37,092 --> 00:44:38,677
You, Gilberto.

317
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:42,389
The reality you built.

318
00:44:42,514 --> 00:44:45,600
<i>And where the fuck has it got you?</i>

319
00:44:45,725 --> 00:44:48,937
You're upset, brother. I get it.

320
00:44:49,062 --> 00:44:52,273
<i>Yeah, I'm pretty fucking pissed off.</i>

321
00:44:52,399 --> 00:44:56,903
Then listen to me. Embrace it.

322
00:44:57,028 --> 00:45:00,240
Look, everything we have,
everything we've ever built,

323
00:45:00,365 --> 00:45:03,034
is because of the decisions I've made.

324
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:05,787
<i>Our best strategy is non-violence.</i>

325
00:45:05,912 --> 00:45:09,040
The best option we have is surrender.

326
00:45:10,417 --> 00:45:13,294
I'm not going to surrender, Gilberto.

327
00:45:16,715 --> 00:45:20,760
That was just a dream
you fell in love with.

328
00:45:21,928 --> 00:45:23,972
It isn't mine.

329
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,060
Miguel?

330
00:46:07,182 --> 00:46:12,896
It takes balls, I'll give him that.
Balls I wasn't sure he had.

331
00:46:14,939 --> 00:46:18,485
You can appreciate
needing to show them off.

332
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:23,990
You again with those trucks?
I have orders to follow.

333
00:46:24,115 --> 00:46:25,909
And I have new orders.

334
00:46:32,707 --> 00:46:35,502
I don't like it,
this disagreement between them.

335
00:46:35,627 --> 00:46:37,545
Doesn't feel right.

336
00:46:39,214 --> 00:46:41,049
It isn't us.

337
00:46:44,594 --> 00:46:46,221
Maybe.

338
00:46:47,388 --> 00:46:49,724
But times are changing.

339
00:46:51,476 --> 00:46:52,811
Let's go!

340
00:46:53,686 --> 00:46:55,104
Follow me!

341
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:12,789
Everything is going to be OK, brother.

342
00:47:13,706 --> 00:47:16,668
- Don't you worry.
- I'm not worried.

343
00:47:20,922 --> 00:47:23,341
Makes you wish you were out there.

344
00:48:02,589 --> 00:48:07,093
Yes, I know she doesn't want to talk
to me, that's why she's not fucking home!

345
00:48:07,218 --> 00:48:09,470
But it's important I talk to her.
Understood?

346
00:48:09,596 --> 00:48:15,143
<i>Look, I don't know what's going on
between you guys, but she's upset.</i>

347
00:48:15,268 --> 00:48:17,562
Pass her the fucking phone now!

348
00:48:17,687 --> 00:48:20,565
<i>No, Jorge. Give her some space.</i>

349
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:22,692
<i>She'll call you when she's ready.</i>
