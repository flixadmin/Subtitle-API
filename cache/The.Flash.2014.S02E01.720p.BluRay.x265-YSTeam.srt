reverses of one another.

My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

50
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:12,530
When I was a child, I saw my mother killed
by something impossible.

51
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,735
My father went to prison for her murder.

52
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:17,117
Then an accident made me the impossible.

53
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:18,824
And I became the Flash.

54
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:22,703
I used my powers to find the man
responsible for my mother's death.

55
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:26,331
I thought I would finally get justice
for my family.

56
00:03:26,747 --> 00:03:27,795
But I failed.

57

It's been six months
since the Singularity.

58

00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:13,026
So, Caitlin was right.

317
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,699
Yes, all humans contain
small amounts of radiation

318
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,529
due to contact with cell phones,
microwaves, televisions, et cetera.

319
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:21,704
Our bodies are natural conductors.

320
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:24,083
I think our meta's been sucking up
all the radiation around him

321
00:21:24,282 --> 00:21:25,535
and using it to power himself.

322
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:28,545
Which is why the X-ray machines at the
hospital failed the day of the rally.

323
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:31,714
So if we wanna find him, we got to look
for places without radiation.

324
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:34,800
All right, guys,
I don't want any of you here right now.

325
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:37,805
Tough. You need your partners.
You need your friends.

326
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:40,266
IRIS: Barry, everyone in this room
cares about you.

327
00:21:40,548 --> 00:21:42,221
But we also care about this city.

328
00:21:42,425 --> 00:21:44,894
We all wanna make a difference,
and that means fighting meta-humans,

329
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:46,646
and that means working with the Flash.

330
00:21:47,138 --> 00:21:49,561
You can't deny us that. Not anymore.

331
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:53,112
Got him. There's a three-block dead zone
near a hazardous waste reclamation plant.

332
00:21:53,311 --> 00:21:55,440
It should be blooming with rads,
and right now it's at zero.

333
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:58,575
That's where you'll find
your Atom Smasher.

334
00:21:59,442 --> 00:22:00,490
Huh.

335
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:06,667
Because he absorbs atomic power and he,
well, smashes.

336
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:08,248
Come here.

337
00:22:08,451 --> 00:22:09,499
(LAUGHS)

338
00:22:10,328 --> 00:22:12,832
- That's a great name. Welcome to the team.
- Thank you.

339
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:16,301
Great. Guys, thank you.
You can go now, all right?

340
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:20,803
Barry, you need to let Cisco and Stein
figure out a way to stop this guy.

341
00:22:21,464 --> 00:22:22,682
No, I don't.

342
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:28,018
(SIGHS)

343
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:35,488
Barry left his comm system behind.
We can't talk to him. He's on his own.

344
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:38,273
(SIGHS)

345
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:54,957
Ah!

346
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:07,386
Well, this is a curveball.

347
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,643
I thought I was going to have to come
looking for you.

348
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,474
I'm not gonna let you hurt anyone else.

349
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:14,810
- I'm only here to hurt you, buddy.
- Yeah?

350
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:18,402
Then why did you kill Albert Rothstein?
And why do you look like him?

351
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:22,486
- You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
- (LAUGHS) Try me.

352
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:24,653
I'm about to.

353
00:23:24,819 --> 00:23:26,571
Is there really no way of knowing
what's going on in there?

354
00:23:26,821 --> 00:23:28,199
I'm looking for the security cameras.

355
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,205
Booya!

356
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:45,679
(GRUNTING)

357
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:50,561
My turn.

358
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:53,523
(CHOKING)

359
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:55,183
Dad.

360
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:57,193
- Maybe I can make it there.
- No, you won't.

361
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:58,441
And what are you gonna do
when you get there?

362
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:00,196
- The Boot didn't work on him.
- Alarm.

363
00:24:00,396 --> 00:24:02,525
- Believe me, we're all alarmed.
- No, the alarm system.

364
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,692
You've tapped into
the surveillance cameras, correct?

365
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:05,949
Correct.

366
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:09,365
Come on, feel the noise.

367
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:10,744
(GROANING)

368
00:24:13,701 --> 00:24:15,875
He said you were some kind of big hero.

369
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:19,049
But you don't seem worthy of him
or this city.

370
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:20,465
(ALARM BLARING)

371
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:27,429
Professor Stein, you are a genius.

372
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,972
I believe
that's already been well established.

373
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:31,220
(LAUGHS)

374
00:24:37,558 --> 00:24:38,605
(PANTING)

375
00:24:48,569 --> 00:24:49,787
No, thank you.

376
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:51,618
Iris says mac and cheese is your favorite.

377
00:24:52,156 --> 00:24:53,578
I'm not hungry.

378
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:57,459
It's been six months, Barry.
You got to eat, son.

379
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:02,134
It's a good move,
being angry all the time.

380
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:03,585
I get it.

381
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:06,137
You miss your mom and dad, and you wanna
show them that you're strong.

382
00:25:06,462 --> 00:25:07,634
Being mad makes it easier.

383
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:12,310
Tougher thing to do
would be to let yourself feel.

384
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:16,940
It's okay to be sad.
You can be sad, Barry.

385
00:25:17,473 --> 00:25:21,319
Your parents will understand
if you're not strong all the time.

386
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:24,861
That is why I'm here.

387
00:25:29,944 --> 00:25:31,946
It's okay, son. I got you.

388
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:43,967
(BEEPING)

389
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:56,387
You're good, I got you.

390
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:01,817
Where is everyone?

391
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:05,404
I figured you wouldn't want an audience
when you came to.

392
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:07,194
(SCOFFS)

393
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:08,907
Yeah, thanks.

394
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:11,656
Iris is right.

395
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:14,661
We're not gonna do this anymore.

396
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,833
For the last six months,
I've given you your space

397
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,999
to work all this out, come back to us.

398
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:25,050
But today proved that
you'd rather just get yourself killed.

399
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,342
(LAUGHS)

400
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:28,679
It's better than
getting my friends killed.

401
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:32,391
You want me to tell you
that it wasn't your fault?

402
00:26:33,674 --> 00:26:36,269
I can't. It was. Guess what?

403
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:40,016
You weren't the only person
making decisions that day.

404
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,857
All of the rest of us were there, too.

405
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:44,566
Eddie and Ronnie...

406
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:49,575
They chose to help you stop Wells,
and stop that...

407
00:26:50,858 --> 00:26:52,781
- Singularity.
- Singularity thing.

408
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,530
It's on all of us, Barry.

409
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,743
So stop with this
hogging all the blame and regret.

410
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:02,413
We got to live with it.

411
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:04,460
Move on.

412
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:08,042
What do I do now?

413
00:27:10,461 --> 00:27:12,589
Well, I know that you've been

414
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:15,596
rebuilding Central City at night.

415
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:18,762
That's just bricks and paint.

416
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:22,432
Maybe you should start trying to rebuild

417
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:25,397
things that really matter.

418
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:42,077
What are you doing here?

419
00:27:42,326 --> 00:27:45,422
Sorry, I should've called or something.

420
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:48,250
I just... I wanted to see you.

421
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:50,675
It's been a while.

422
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:56,262
Yeah, Cisco said that he saw you
at the Flash Day celebration.

423
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:57,593
I was surprised.

424
00:27:58,801 --> 00:28:03,307
You better than anyone know that
I wasn't the hero that day.

425
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,314
- Of course you were.
- No.

(SIGHS)

427
00:28:10,646 --> 00:28:12,819
Cait, Ronnie died saving me and I...

428
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:16,491
I should've saved him and I'm so sorry.

429
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:19,490
Barry, I know that you did
everything you could.

430
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,116
It wasn't your fault.

431
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:27,835
I don't blame you for Ronnie's death.
I blame myself.

432
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:29,211
You...

433
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,300
Why?

(SIGHS)

435
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:37,679
When Ronnie first became Firestorm,
he asked me to leave Central City

436
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:40,640
and go somewhere
that we could have a normal life.

437
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,227
And I said no.

438
00:28:45,848 --> 00:28:51,652
I couldn't leave S.T.A.R. Labs,
Dr. Wells, you.

439
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:56,034
If I had gone with him,
Ronnie would still be alive.

440
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:01,582
Being at S.T.A.R. Labs
just made think of that every single day.

441
00:29:03,991 --> 00:29:05,038
- Here.
- (CHUCKLES)

442

Oh, you carry a handkerchief now?

443
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:09,547
What are you, 80?

- What's that?
- Uh, it's uh...

446
00:29:17,381 --> 00:29:23,558
Apparently, in the case of his death,
Wells had some kind of, um, living will.

447
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:28,433
- And you haven't watched it yet?
- No.

448
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:32,692
No, I've been too afraid.

449
00:29:34,855 --> 00:29:36,403
What if we watched it together?

450
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:40,746
All right.

451
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,373
(EXHALES)

452
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:51,923
Hello, Barry. If you're watching this,

453
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:55,093
that means
something has gone horribly wrong.

454
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,265
I'm dead, and the last 15 years
have been for nothing.

455
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:03,597
Bummer, 15 years. (LAUGHS)

456
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:07,560
You know what I realized?
In all those years helping raise you,

457
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:10,105
we were never truly enemies, Barry.

458
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:12,318
I'm not the thing you hate.

459
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:16,773
And so I'm gonna give you the thing
that you want most.

460
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,320
It won't matter.

461
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:21,111
You'll never be truly happy. Barry Allen.

462
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:23,489
Trust me, I know you.

463
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:27,913
Now, erase everything
I said up to this point.

464
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:30,333
Give the following message to the police.

465
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:33,339
My name is Harrison Wells.

466

Being of sound mind and body,

467
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:38,677
I freely confess to the murder
of Nora Allen in her home

468
00:30:38,961 --> 00:30:41,464
on the night of March 18th,
in the year 2000.

469
00:30:42,089 --> 00:30:44,092
- I attacked Nora Allen...
- CAITLIN: Oh, my God.

00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,347
(VIDEO CONTINUES PLAYING)

471
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:47,432
He confessed.

472
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:50,481
This is it.
