00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:26,376
your current friend, Behrad.

353
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,503
- Okay.

354
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,171
- You're needed

355
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,171
on the Waverider immediately.

356
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:32,673
It's a

357
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:32,673
timequake-wave-mergency.

358
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,759
- Well, that is the beauty

359
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,759
of having a time machine.

360
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,095
I can always just go back

361
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,095
in time and fix it.

362
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,306
- But, Sara!

363
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,306
- B, look, I'm not gonna go.

364
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,266
All right?

365
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:42,809
- Come here.

366
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,352
I want to let you in

367
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,352
on a little secret, okay?

368
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:47,063
- Okay.

369
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:47,063
- So I just picked this up

370
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:50,484
because I am going to propose

371
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:50,484
to Ava tonight.

372
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:52,652
- Where'd you get this?

373
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:52,652
Versailles?

374
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:54,070
The Romanovs?

375
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:56,114
- My mom.

376
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:56,114
- Go figure.

377
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,074
Sara Lance, old-school

378
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,074
romantic.

379
00:10:58,116 --> 00:10:59,451
- Yeah, you know me,

380
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:01,328
and tonight is the night,

381
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:01,328
and nothing,

382
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:04,414
not even a timeline emergency,

383
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:04,414
is gonna get in my way.

384
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:06,291
- There you are.

385
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:06,291
- Hey!

386
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:10,253
- Hey.

387
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:10,253
- What are you two doing?

388
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:12,839
- Ah, just talking rings,

389
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:12,839
Fates, looms,

390
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,341
- Yeah.

391
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,341
- You know, recap stuff.

392
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,301
- Mm.

393
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,301
Wait, wait, wait.

394
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:17,969
Wasn't that silver streak

395
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:17,969
in your hair

396
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,638
on the other side before?

397
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:23,850
- Yeah, actually.

398
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:23,850
- Oh.

399
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:25,185
Babe!

400
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:25,185
Charlie is about to go on.

401
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,436
- Yes!

402
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,436
- Come on, let's go!

403
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:28,396
- Let's go!

404
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:28,396
- Come on.

405
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:29,939
- I'll meet you inside.

406
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:29,939
- You're not coming?

407
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:34,068
- Smoke o'clock.

408
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:34,068
- Ah.

409
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,197
- [sighs]

410
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,622
[dramatic music]

411
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:50,544
- Stop!

412
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:50,544
Avas, we're on her side!

413
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:51,670
- They're helping us

414
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:51,670
rescue you.

415
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,921
-Us?

416
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,921
- Yeah.

417
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,340
- Mick!

418
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:56,924
Oh, my God, you're alive!

419
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,926
- He flew here with Kayla.

420
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,513
- Wait, why didn't

421
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,513
she try to eat you?

422
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:03,848
- We got to go!

423
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:03,848
- I can't until I stop Bishop.

424
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,850
He's got

425
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,850
this crazy intergalactic plan

426
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:07,394
to try to clone me.

427
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,437
- A planet of clone Avas

428
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,437
and Saras?

429
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:11,147
Are we sure we

430
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:11,147
want to stop that?

431
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:13,024
- I speak for all the Avas

432
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,527
when I say it would be an honor

433
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,527
to help thwart him.

434
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:17,195
- Great.

435
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:17,195
How do we do it?

436
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,113
- Well, redundancy

437
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,113
is Bishop's religion.

438
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,115
If we take down one generator,

439
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,115
the backup kicks in,

440
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,660
but I guess if we destroy them

441
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,660
all simultaneously,

442
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:24,911
his whole operation

443
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:24,911
would go down.

444
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,538
- Well, you better make it

445
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,538
fast.

446
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,707
When those moons set,

447
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,707
Kayla is gone.

448
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:31,084
- All right, let's split up

449
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:31,084
and cover more ground.

450
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,712
- I'll get some explosives.

451
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:35,380
- Thank you for finding me.

452
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:37,674
- The ship sucked without you.

453
00:12:37,716 --> 00:12:39,593
Come on.

454
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:43,304
- Sara is not leaving

455
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:43,304
until she proposes to Ava.

456
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:45,557
- Yeah, but Sara

457
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:45,557
never proposed that night.

458
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:47,183
- Why not?

459
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:50,144
- No clue, but if we get Sara

460
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:50,144
to propose,

461
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:51,854
we could get her on the ship

462
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:51,854
before the aliens come.

463
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,356
- Unfortunately, we were all

464
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:54,649
with Sara

465
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:54,649
the rest of the night.

466
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:56,901
- Well, not all of us.

467
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:02,323
- Do you two have something

468
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:02,323
you want to share

469
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:04,075
with the rest of the class?

470
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:07,245
- There is a 20-minute window

471
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,330
where we'll be out

472
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,330
of the picture, so to speak.

473
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:11,332
- More like a generous 10.

474
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:11,332
- 15!

475
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:14,294
- Hmm, 8.

476
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:14,294
- Just go get Sara to propose!

477
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,088
[rock music]

478
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,340
- Where the bloody hell

479
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,340
is Sara, eh?

480
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:23,637
- Hey, girl!

481
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:25,513
- Hi.

482
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:27,390
- Have you seen Sara?

483
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:29,476
- Yeah, she's in the bathroom.

484
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:29,476
Why?

485
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:34,272
- She borrowed my makeup,

486
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:34,272
and John needs it now.

487
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:39,486
You look great.

488
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:39,486
So good to see you.

489
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:47,452
- [coughing and retching]

490
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,998
- Sara, you all right?

491
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,998
Are you pissed?

492
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:56,294
- No, I think I just need

493
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:56,294
to drink more and a mint.

494
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,463
- She's nervous

495
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,463
about proposing.

496
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:02,676
- Wait, how did you--

497
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:02,676
ugh, Behrad!

498
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:04,427
- Hey, hey, hey,

499
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:04,427
you listen to me, all right?

500
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:06,680
All right?

501
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:06,680
You are Sara fricking Lance.

502
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:08,389
Now, who's gonna

503
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:08,389
turn you down, eh?

504
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:09,890
Now, you go out there,

505
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:09,890
and you get on bended knee.

506
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,351
You put a ring on it

507
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:12,727
and you take that lady home

508
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:12,727
to celebrate.

509
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,688
All right?

510
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,688
Because you deserve it.

511
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:17,148
- What's it to you?

512
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:17,148
- What?

513
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:20,151
I just love love.

514
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:23,613
- You just "love love"?

515
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:25,072
- Yeah.

516
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,283
- Hey, Charlie. Is that you?

517
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:29,327
Just stop messing with me.

518
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:29,327
All right?

519
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:33,498
I'm gonna do it

520
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:33,498
my way in my time.

521
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:38,002
- Hey, what was that?

522
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:38,002
- What was what?

523
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,880
- Willingness to go along

524
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,880
with a crazy plan,

525
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:44,050
corny lines about love.
