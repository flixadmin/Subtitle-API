1
00:00:02,195 --> 00:00:04,176
Sales for the first
generation of Ava clones

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,011
have been through the roof as predicted.

3
00:00:06,035 --> 00:00:07,846
My dream of an Ava
in every home and business

4
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:09,348
has become a reality.

5
00:00:09,372 --> 00:00:11,435
Wonderful. Congratulations, sir.

6
00:00:14,977 --> 00:00:16,540
Uh, sir...

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,359
I was going to wait until
after the investment meeting

8
00:00:20,383 --> 00:00:22,160
to mention this.

9
00:00:22,184 --> 00:00:23,695
But I think it's time you told me

10
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:26,331
about this mystery project
you've been working on.

11
00:00:26,355 --> 00:00:28,733
It's just that you've
diverted billions into it,

12
00:00:28,757 --> 00:00:30,768
and I really feel like it's time

13
00:00:30,792 --> 00:00:32,304
I knew what the project was all about.

14
00:00:32,328 --> 00:00:33,691
Where do you think I'm taking you?

15
00:00:35,431 --> 00:00:37,128
Ta-da!

16
00:00:40,702 --> 00:00:43,515
It's called a Waverider.

17
00:00:43,539 --> 00:00:45,284
Waverider?

18
00:00:45,308 --> 00:00:49,054
Oh, because it's shaped like a boat,

19
00:00:49,078 --> 00:00:50,722
like it rides on the waves.

20
00:00:50,746 --> 00:00:52,457
No, though it can go underwater.

21
00:00:52,481 --> 00:00:54,959
But never mind that,
Waverider is what it's called

22
00:00:54,983 --> 00:00:57,796
in the futuristic blueprints
I was given.

23
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,016
It's a time ship.

24
00:01:02,057 --> 00:01:03,667
Waverider.

25
00:01:03,691 --> 00:01:06,926
Are you married to that name,
or can we still pitch on it?

26
00:01:08,296 --> 00:01:10,107
Welcome to the bridge,

27
00:01:10,131 --> 00:01:12,576
the nerve center of the entire ship.

28
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,646
Hmm, not the most efficient
use of space, though.

29
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:17,581
Maybe it could double
as a conference room.

30
00:01:17,605 --> 00:01:21,185
And now it's time for you
to see an old friend.

31
00:01:21,209 --> 00:01:23,773
Gideon, time to wake up.

32
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,291
There you are.

33
00:01:27,315 --> 00:01:29,026
My transfer to the ship's mainframe

34
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:31,128
- appears to be a success.
- You remember Gideon?

35
00:01:31,152 --> 00:01:32,830
Oh, yes. Her.

36
00:01:32,854 --> 00:01:35,866
Welcome to your new home, Gideon.

37
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:37,168
So much more space to roam

38
00:01:37,192 --> 00:01:38,836
than that tiny hard drive you were in.

39
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,404
Oh, take a couple laps around,
stretch your legs.

40
00:01:41,428 --> 00:01:43,893
You have vantage points
all over the ship.

41
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,149
You followed my exact specifications,

42
00:01:52,173 --> 00:01:54,584
but I don't have any
visual access in section A2.

43
00:01:54,608 --> 00:01:56,854
Well, section A2 is
the only bathroom on the ship.

44
00:01:56,878 --> 00:01:58,455
Can't have you spying on me in there.

45
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,525
- A man needs his privacy.
- Yes.

46
00:02:01,549 --> 00:02:03,159
Sir, as impressive as this ship is,

47
00:02:03,183 --> 00:02:04,962
how does it relate
to the Ava Corp mission

48
00:02:04,986 --> 00:02:06,463
of improving people's lives

49
00:02:06,487 --> 00:02:08,264
through clone technology exactly?

50
00:02:08,288 --> 00:02:10,300
Well, I'm simply expanding our mission

51
00:02:10,324 --> 00:02:13,003
by adding time travel to the mix.

52
00:02:13,027 --> 00:02:15,973
But the true perk of this ship
is to finally get revenge

53
00:02:15,997 --> 00:02:18,008
on those time travelers who abducted me,

54
00:02:18,032 --> 00:02:21,812
used me for my genius, and
then messed with my mind.

55
00:02:21,836 --> 00:02:24,114
May I remind you that a
Time Master's number one duty

56
00:02:24,138 --> 00:02:25,915
is to protect the timeline from any

57
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:27,550
and all threats to its integrity?

58
00:02:27,574 --> 00:02:29,619
Yes, yes, Gideon, that's a given,

59
00:02:29,643 --> 00:02:32,889
considering the job title...
Time Master.

60
00:02:32,913 --> 00:02:34,124
And before we start,

61
00:02:34,148 --> 00:02:36,493
you must take the Time Master's oath.

62
00:02:36,517 --> 00:02:40,330
I swear to protect and defend
the integrity of the timeline

63
00:02:40,354 --> 00:02:42,732
with all my ability
until the end of my days.

64
00:02:42,756 --> 00:02:46,769
Congratulations. You are now
Time Master of this Waverider.

65
00:02:46,793 --> 00:02:48,371
Great.

66
00:02:48,395 --> 00:02:52,600
Let's set sail on our maiden voyage

67
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:57,838
and protect the timeline
from those damn Legends.

68
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:14,490
- Synced and corrected by Firefly -
- www.addic7ed.com -

69
00:03:22,095 --> 00:03:24,739
The machine is ruined,
wrecked, absolutely kaput,

70
00:03:24,763 --> 00:03:26,007
and all because of you lot!

71
00:03:26,031 --> 00:03:27,742
Okay, hold on, how is it our fault

72
00:03:27,766 --> 00:03:28,844
we didn't land in Tahiti?

73
00:03:28,868 --> 00:03:31,980
Because it wasn't designed
to take all you people.

74
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:34,616
The excess weight threw it all off, man.

75
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,019
Okay, so I'm guessing we have
no idea what year we're in?

76
00:03:38,043 --> 00:03:40,055
The chrono-gauge and the ignition coil

77
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:41,956
are both sequenced
to the directional compass,

78
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,524
which was damaged in the landing.

79
00:03:43,548 --> 00:03:44,859
So no, I don't think so.

80
00:03:44,883 --> 00:03:46,194
Well, that doesn't sound too good,

81
00:03:46,218 --> 00:03:48,196
but hey, who needs a chrono-Gauge

82
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,098
when you have two ex-Time Bureau agents

83
00:03:50,122 --> 00:03:52,200
with extensive
historical knowledge, Gary?

84
00:03:52,224 --> 00:03:53,434
That's right, Ava.

85
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:57,005
And, uh, based on the local flora,

86
00:03:57,029 --> 00:03:59,774
there's a chance
we're in the prehistoric era.

87
00:03:59,798 --> 00:04:02,010
Give or take a few thousand years.

88
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:03,578
Maybe we'll see dinosaurs.

89
00:04:03,602 --> 00:04:05,847
You'd better hope
we don't see a dinosaur, Gary.

90
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:07,616
Okay, so it looks like we're

91
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,118
making this prehistoric forest
home for a while.

92
00:04:10,142 --> 00:04:12,386
So let's get comfortable, gang.

93
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:13,989
Guys, come on.

94
00:04:14,013 --> 00:04:15,824
This team has been stranded
more times than I can count

95
00:04:15,848 --> 00:04:17,693
and in way worse places than this.

96
00:04:17,717 --> 00:04:19,193
She's right.

97
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:21,862
And I know nothing has gone our way

98
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:23,954
since we left Odessa, but...

99
00:04:25,524 --> 00:04:27,201
- They're gonna get better.
- Yeah.

100
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:28,836
Okay? All right.

101
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,839
So you are the only one
that can fix this time machine.

102
00:04:31,863 --> 00:04:34,208
If you can repair
that directional compass,

103
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:35,376
are we back in business?

104
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,710
It would be a difficult task

105
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:38,179
even if we did have the proper tools.

106
00:04:38,203 --> 00:04:40,148
- I can help.
- Me too.

107
00:04:40,172 --> 00:04:43,584
You got two techies
at your disposal, my man.

108
00:04:43,608 --> 00:04:45,219
Just some peace to be able

109
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:47,054
to get on with my work is all I ask.

110
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:50,558
You know, I will venture off
and maybe find some lodestone

111
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:52,893
or some other magnetic material
which conducts electricity

112
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,784
and then I can fix the compass.

113
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:59,167
Hey, maybe you and B
should go with Dr. Cranky.

114
00:04:59,191 --> 00:05:00,301
We'll set up camp here.

115
00:05:00,325 --> 00:05:02,269
Mm-hmm. All over it.

116
00:05:02,293 --> 00:05:04,171
Hey, look, I know we didn't
really get a chance

117
00:05:04,195 --> 00:05:05,806
to talk about the whole moving in thing.

118
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,808
No, it's totally cool.

119
00:05:07,832 --> 00:05:09,777
As usual, we have bigger fish to fry.

120
00:05:09,801 --> 00:05:13,412
I know, but, you know,
moving into a spiritual realm,

121
00:05:13,436 --> 00:05:15,015
that's... that's a lot to... to take in.

122
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,151
I just wanna make sure
you're not freaking out.

123
00:05:17,175 --> 00:05:20,520
Freaking... me? No, I'm super chill.

124
00:05:20,544 --> 00:05:24,830
I am, however, concerned
about our captains.

125
00:05:24,854 --> 00:05:28,867
Oh, yeah. Well, good
luck with that. Bye.

126
00:05:28,891 --> 00:05:30,201
- What?
- Yeah.

127
00:05:30,225 --> 00:05:31,550
- Miss you.
- Bye.

128
00:05:33,424 --> 00:05:35,502
Psst. Hey, you two.

129
00:05:35,526 --> 00:05:37,437
Come here, shut up.

130
00:05:37,461 --> 00:05:39,729
Do either one of you know
how to read lips?

131
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:43,328
Who needs to read lips
when Spooner can read minds?

132
00:05:49,672 --> 00:05:51,784
I'm getting some major anxiety vibes

133
00:05:51,808 --> 00:05:53,352
- from Sara right now.
- Yeah.

134
00:05:53,376 --> 00:05:55,788
And I don't need superpowers
to see that Ava is cracking.

135
00:05:55,812 --> 00:05:58,091
They're just stressing
each other out at this point.

136
00:05:58,115 --> 00:06:00,026
Okay, so let's separate them
so they each

137
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:02,483
don't have a complete
and total meltdown, okay?

138
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,064
Hey there, jefa.

139
00:06:05,088 --> 00:06:06,699
How about we hunt down some dinner?

140
00:06:06,723 --> 00:06:09,190
Yeah, let's go stab something.

141
00:06:10,326 --> 00:06:12,939
Want to go for a hike?
We could get some firewood.

142
00:06:12,963 --> 00:06:14,729
Yeah. I would love a multitask.

143
00:06:15,098 --> 00:06:16,262
Great.

144
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,748
- So...
- Oh, Gary.

145
00:06:21,772 --> 00:06:24,683
You and Zari. Saw you talking.

146
00:06:24,707 --> 00:06:26,585
And?

147
00:06:26,609 --> 00:06:28,520
She asked me to move in
with her in the totem.

148
00:06:28,544 --> 00:06:31,479
Oh, that's great!

149
00:06:32,315 --> 00:06:34,926
That's not... not great?

150
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:37,062
Sorry, the more handsome
the face, the harder it is

151
00:06:37,086 --> 00:06:38,297
for me to get a read.

152
00:06:38,321 --> 00:06:39,798
All right, just back up.

153
00:06:39,822 --> 00:06:41,166
It's just,

154
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:43,101
I haven't spent that much
time in the totem,

155
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:45,704
and she sprung it on me
before we time jumped here.

156
00:06:45,728 --> 00:06:48,206
So I really haven't had
a chance to process it.

157
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:50,242
Well, Nate, the totem seems quite small.

158
00:06:50,266 --> 00:06:51,843
How do you get inside?

159
00:06:51,867 --> 00:06:53,712
Are you and Zari gonna live
in a house together?

160
00:06:53,736 --> 00:06:55,748
Will there be pie? 'Cause I
really like strawberry rhubarb.

161
00:06:55,772 --> 00:06:57,149
I love strawberry rhubarb.

162
00:06:57,173 --> 00:06:59,117
We need to focus
on today's problems, okay?

163
00:06:59,141 --> 00:07:01,720
How about you guys forage for some food?

164
00:07:01,744 --> 00:07:03,889
Leaves, nuts, berries,
anything we can eat.

165
00:07:03,913 --> 00:07:05,356
- Okay? Go.
- Okay.

166
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,758
- Go.
- Okay.

167
00:07:06,782 --> 00:07:07,792
Okay.

168
00:07:07,816 --> 00:07:09,394
You sure you don't want me
to stick around,

169
00:07:09,418 --> 00:07:11,763
be your sounding board? We can...

170
00:07:11,787 --> 00:07:13,264
- Gary?
- Hmm?

171
00:07:13,288 --> 00:07:15,400
You will not be my sounding board today.

172
00:07:15,424 --> 00:07:17,302
Okay? Thank you.

173
00:07:17,326 --> 00:07:19,359
- Okay.
- Go on.

174
00:07:22,864 --> 00:07:24,542
Well, at least these two ding-dongs

175
00:07:24,566 --> 00:07:25,876
can't screw anything up here

176
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,897
that'll attract the evil Waverider.

177
00:07:36,645 --> 00:07:38,989
Check out that view
of the Temporal Zone.

178
00:07:39,013 --> 00:07:40,725
Worth a million bucks, huh?

179
00:07:40,749 --> 00:07:43,928
Mm. Considering this ship
cost many thousand times more,

180
00:07:43,952 --> 00:07:45,395
I'm not sure how the board's gonna feel

181
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:46,963
about your investment, sir.

182
00:07:46,987 --> 00:07:48,432
There's one thing you just
can't put a price on,

183
00:07:48,456 --> 00:07:49,700
- Assistant Ava.
- Hmm?

184
00:07:49,724 --> 00:07:51,601
- Revenge.
- Ah.

185
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:54,471
Captain, we're getting an
alert of several anachronisms

186
00:07:54,495 --> 00:07:56,440
in 1925, Odessa, Texas.

187
00:07:56,464 --> 00:07:59,976
Hmm. "Captain". I like that.

188
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,111
Odessa. Wait a second. Texas.

189
00:08:02,135 --> 00:08:03,714
That's where the Legends took me.

190
00:08:03,738 --> 00:08:06,249
Gideon, you found them.
Engage weapons systems.

191
00:08:06,273 --> 00:08:08,117
I'm gonna bomb the
living daylights out of them.

192
00:08:08,141 --> 00:08:10,119
I am advising against
this course of action.

193
00:08:10,143 --> 00:08:11,488
How else am I supposed to wipe them

194
00:08:11,512 --> 00:08:12,556
off the face of the Earth?

195
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,392
Eliminating the Legends
in this blunt manner

196
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:16,113
will cause excessive collateral damage.

197
00:08:18,718 --> 00:08:20,448
Your warning is duly noted.

198
00:08:29,462 --> 00:08:31,907
Yes!

199
00:08:31,931 --> 00:08:35,310
Those bastards finally
got what they deserved.

200
00:08:35,334 --> 00:08:37,802
That was a lot easier than I expected.

201
00:08:38,938 --> 00:08:40,683
Can we please go home now, sir?

202
00:08:40,707 --> 00:08:43,386
No, the captain's impulsive
and violent actions

203
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:45,187
guarantee ripple effects in the timeline

204
00:08:45,211 --> 00:08:46,722
that we will have to clean up.

205
00:08:46,746 --> 00:08:48,323
More precise measures must be taken

206
00:08:48,347 --> 00:08:50,058
when dealing with threats
moving forward.

207
00:08:50,082 --> 00:08:52,160
Trust me, this was the only way

208
00:08:52,184 --> 00:08:54,296
to deal with those Legends.

209
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,431
And if any ripples arise, we'll just use

210
00:08:56,455 --> 00:08:59,820
our brand-new time ship
to smooth them out.

211
00:09:07,633 --> 00:09:11,379
Hey, buddy. Got your coat.

212
00:09:11,403 --> 00:09:12,815
You okay?

213
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:14,349
Listen,

214
00:09:14,373 --> 00:09:17,152
we don't really have time
for a rest stop.

215
00:09:17,176 --> 00:09:18,987
We need to find the materials you need

216
00:09:19,011 --> 00:09:20,422
to fix your time machine, yeah?

217
00:09:20,446 --> 00:09:22,057
You really don't understand, do you?

218
00:09:22,081 --> 00:09:24,860
I just told you lot
what you wanted to hear.

219
00:09:24,884 --> 00:09:28,618
In reality, there is no point
in fixing the wretched machine.

220
00:09:30,189 --> 00:09:32,467
Sure, there was a little
problem with the dismount,

221
00:09:32,491 --> 00:09:34,969
but your invention actually worked.

222
00:09:34,993 --> 00:09:39,040
Yeah. So why don't we, uh,
put our shoes back on,

223
00:09:39,064 --> 00:09:40,674
and we can help you find magnetite

224
00:09:40,698 --> 00:09:42,810
or whatever mineral it is you need to...

225
00:09:42,834 --> 00:09:44,946
to get your invention
back up and running?

226
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:47,148
To fix the machine,
we need to fix the compass.

227
00:09:47,172 --> 00:09:49,083
And in order to do that,
we need magnetic material

228
00:09:49,107 --> 00:09:50,251
which conducts electricity.

229
00:09:50,275 --> 00:09:53,386
Now, I doubt that you would
even know what to look for.

230
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:55,289
And either way, it's not about
fixing the machine

231
00:09:55,313 --> 00:09:56,824
or not fixing the machine, you see,

232
00:09:56,848 --> 00:10:00,613
because no matter what I do,
I'm always meant to fail.

233
00:10:02,354 --> 00:10:06,840
You see, my machine,
it was meant to explode.

234
00:10:06,864 --> 00:10:09,703
Yeah, but it didn't explode.
We're alive and we're here.

235
00:10:09,727 --> 00:10:11,004
Yes, yes, we're here.

236
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:13,092
We're here in the middle of nowhere!

237
00:10:14,999 --> 00:10:18,698
My divine mission, derailed once again.

238
00:10:20,638 --> 00:10:23,550
There is no fighting God's will, my boy.

239
00:10:23,574 --> 00:10:25,571
Being here is proof of that.

240
00:10:27,244 --> 00:10:28,875
You lot might as well get comfortable.

241
00:10:30,748 --> 00:10:32,926
We're not going anywhere,

242
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:36,516
because nowhere is exactly
where I'm meant to be.

243
00:10:51,138 --> 00:10:52,682
Outstanding. You can't even tell

244
00:10:52,706 --> 00:10:55,018
that Gideon fabricated this food.

245
00:10:55,042 --> 00:10:56,252
- Fabricated?
- Mm.

246
00:10:56,276 --> 00:10:57,888
- From what?
- Oh...

247
00:10:57,912 --> 00:10:59,589
We've received an alert
about a disturbance

248
00:10:59,613 --> 00:11:01,558
- in the timeline.
- Fun.

249
00:11:01,582 --> 00:11:03,993
Which thrilling time period
are we headed to next?

250
00:11:04,017 --> 00:11:06,284
- 1925.
- Ooh.

251
00:11:07,254 --> 00:11:10,166
- Weren't we just in 1925?
- That is quite a coincidence.

252
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:12,101
What's the disturbance, Gideon?

253
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,903
J. Edgar Hoover has disappeared.

254
00:11:13,927 --> 00:11:16,772
And unfortunately,
it is not a coincidence.

255
00:11:16,796 --> 00:11:19,309
My calculations confirm
your attack on the Legends

256
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:21,263
caused this aberration.

257
00:11:23,003 --> 00:11:27,189
Well, if Hoover is the problem,

258
00:11:27,213 --> 00:11:30,153
then Hoover is the solution.

259
00:11:30,177 --> 00:11:32,355
We'll just use my clone technology.

260
00:11:32,379 --> 00:11:34,524
And make a clone of Mr. Hoover.

261
00:11:34,548 --> 00:11:36,292
So we can plop him right back
into the timeline,

262
00:11:36,316 --> 00:11:38,328
- and no one will even know.
- Mm-hmm.

263
00:11:38,352 --> 00:11:41,331
Clones are still human
and humans are fallible.

264
00:11:41,355 --> 00:11:43,333
Remember, one of your Ava clones

265
00:11:43,357 --> 00:11:45,969
eventually became a Legend
and helped kidnap you.

266
00:11:45,993 --> 00:11:47,937
Okay, Gideon, there's absolutely no need

267
00:11:47,961 --> 00:11:50,138
to lump us all in
with that horrible traitor.

268
00:11:50,162 --> 00:11:52,274
Mr. Hoover is integral
to many seminal moments

269
00:11:52,298 --> 00:11:54,042
in history. We cannot risk a clone

270
00:11:54,066 --> 00:11:56,044
straying from his historical to-do list.

271
00:11:56,068 --> 00:12:00,954
Then we'll combine my clone
tech with your computer tech

272
00:12:00,978 --> 00:12:02,951
and make a Hoover robot.

273
00:12:02,975 --> 00:12:04,453
We can program him to carry out

274
00:12:04,477 --> 00:12:06,321
every action
that is critical to history.

275
00:12:06,345 --> 00:12:07,922
That's actually quite brilliant.

276
00:12:07,946 --> 00:12:10,944
I know, I came up with it.

277
00:12:13,152 --> 00:12:15,383
I'll have to add "robot maker"
to my hyphenate.

278
00:12:23,396 --> 00:12:25,326
It's alive.

279
00:12:27,265 --> 00:12:29,978
The cure for crime
is not the electric chair

280
00:12:30,002 --> 00:12:31,445
but the high chair.

281
00:12:31,469 --> 00:12:33,748
He's perfect.

282
00:12:33,772 --> 00:12:36,670
Time to go forth
and save history, Mr. Hoover.

283
00:12:39,511 --> 00:12:41,055
It's like no matter what we do,

284
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:42,657
we make everything worse.

285
00:12:42,681 --> 00:12:44,058
And I try to keep it together,

286
00:12:44,082 --> 00:12:46,561
you know, for... for Sara and the team.

287
00:12:46,585 --> 00:12:48,663
But I don't always have all the answers,

288
00:12:48,687 --> 00:12:50,431
and being co-captains in life

289
00:12:50,455 --> 00:12:51,966
and on the ship,
it's a delicate balance.

290
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:54,068
Sometimes I just wish
someone else was in charge.

291
00:12:54,092 --> 00:12:55,703
But it's... it's what I signed up for.

292
00:12:55,727 --> 00:12:57,906
So it's fine. I mean, I'm fine.

293
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:59,339
You're not fine.

294
00:12:59,363 --> 00:13:01,561
- I'm fine.
- You're not, Ava.

295
00:13:06,236 --> 00:13:08,534
Permuto.

296
00:13:10,608 --> 00:13:13,275
But you're on your way.

297
00:13:17,247 --> 00:13:21,733
Cheers to your well-earned
promotion to Time Mistress.

298
00:13:21,757 --> 00:13:23,764
Hmm, Time Mistress Ava

299
00:13:23,788 --> 00:13:26,066
does have a certain ring
to it, doesn't it?

300
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:28,334
Captain, it appears
that the Hoover robot

301
00:13:28,358 --> 00:13:30,103
initiated its self-destruct sequence

302
00:13:30,127 --> 00:13:32,505
in the state of Arkansas
and has been destroyed.

303
00:13:32,529 --> 00:13:35,241
Destroy... we just
put him into the time...

304
00:13:35,265 --> 00:13:37,310
I'm pulling up the robot's visual feed.

305
00:13:37,334 --> 00:13:39,164
Let's see what happened.

306
00:13:41,871 --> 00:13:44,250
No, it can't be.

307
00:13:44,274 --> 00:13:45,985
J. Edgar Hoover, a robot.

308
00:13:46,009 --> 00:13:47,220
Are those the Legends?

309
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:48,988
It appears they're still alive.

310
00:13:49,012 --> 00:13:51,891
Thank you. I can see that.

311
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:54,227
Well, I'll just build
another Hoover bot and...

312
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:56,329
Add a special protocol

313
00:13:56,353 --> 00:13:58,898
to hunt down and eliminate the Legends.

314
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:00,300
That protocol is not part of.

315
00:14:00,324 --> 00:14:02,068
J. Edgar Hoover's original timeline.

316
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:03,803
And once the Hoover bot's
done with the Legends,

317
00:14:03,827 --> 00:14:06,106
it can resume its historical
to-do list. Yes?

318
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:07,473
Exactly. She gets it.

319
00:14:07,497 --> 00:14:09,642
I'd advise against
this course of action.

320
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,577
Let's vote. We all have equal say

321
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,913
now that we have
a Time Mistress on board.

322
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:16,548
All those in favor of
the special protocol,

323
00:14:16,572 --> 00:14:17,850
say, "Aye". Aye.

324
00:14:17,874 --> 00:14:19,919
- Aye.
- Nay.

325
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:21,821
Looks like you've been outvoted, Gideon.

326
00:14:21,845 --> 00:14:25,043
Come, Time Mistress Ava,
we have work to do.

327
00:14:32,522 --> 00:14:35,434
What do you mean the Hoover 2.0 blew up?

328
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,036
Its programming was hacked.

329
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:40,006
The incident also caused
another massive aberration.

330
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:42,707
Thomas Edison suffered
a heart attack and died.

331
00:14:42,731 --> 00:14:45,210
We really should have
just gone back to Ava Corp.

332
00:14:45,234 --> 00:14:47,812
This situation with the Legends
is getting worse and worse.

333
00:14:47,836 --> 00:14:50,081
It's because these androids are weak.

334
00:14:50,105 --> 00:14:52,284
They need weapons to defend
themselves against the Legends.

335
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:55,987
Something built in, like lasers
that shoot out of their eyes.

336
00:14:56,011 --> 00:14:57,589
What if their hands were guns?

337
00:14:57,613 --> 00:14:59,158
You're forgetting our prime directive

338
00:14:59,182 --> 00:15:00,392
to protect the timeline.

339
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:02,161
You're such a computer, Gideon.

340
00:15:02,185 --> 00:15:04,996
Start thinking outside of that
little computer box of yours.

341
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,766
No, I am digging this weapons idea.

342
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:10,302
Let's start fresh in the morning.

343
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,003
Once we make these adjustments,

344
00:15:12,027 --> 00:15:14,825
those Legends won't stand a chance.

345
00:15:18,401 --> 00:15:21,212
So let's talk, Nate.

346
00:15:21,236 --> 00:15:24,448
Should you move
into the totem with Zari?

347
00:15:24,472 --> 00:15:27,770
Pros... And cons.

348
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:31,454
Pro: I get to see Zari every day,

349
00:15:31,478 --> 00:15:33,857
which is a really good thing.

350
00:15:33,881 --> 00:15:37,460
What if I don't like it
in the totem?

351
00:15:37,484 --> 00:15:38,929
Then what?

352
00:15:38,953 --> 00:15:40,864
Pro: Zari's happy in the totem

353
00:15:40,888 --> 00:15:42,365
and she wants me to be with her.

354
00:15:42,389 --> 00:15:43,801
Maybe that's enough.

355
00:15:43,825 --> 00:15:46,837
Wait! Were you just talking to yourself?

356
00:15:46,861 --> 00:15:48,271
Did I miss your epiphany?

357
00:15:48,295 --> 00:15:49,639
You better not have one without me.

358
00:15:49,663 --> 00:15:51,108
Gary, I already told you,

359
00:15:51,132 --> 00:15:52,876
you are not my sounding
board today, okay?

360
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,944
So why don't you guys
go back into the woods

361
00:15:54,968 --> 00:15:56,946
and find some more food?
It's gonna be dark soon.

362
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:59,082
Enjoy the great outdoors.

363
00:15:59,106 --> 00:16:02,051
I just need a little more time
to, uh, work on this stuff.

364
00:16:02,075 --> 00:16:04,973
Fine, but no epiphanies without me.

365
00:16:07,348 --> 00:16:08,644
Bye.

366
00:16:11,652 --> 00:16:13,218
Bye.

367
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,399
Now, where was I? Oh, con.

368
00:16:16,423 --> 00:16:18,086
What if her ancestors hate me?

369
00:16:20,827 --> 00:16:22,505
I totally get how you feel, Gwyn.

370
00:16:22,529 --> 00:16:23,806
We all have our low points,

371
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:25,207
but you gotta hang in there, man.

372
00:16:25,231 --> 00:16:27,109
"Hang in there", he says.

373
00:16:27,133 --> 00:16:28,844
See, there was this time

374
00:16:28,868 --> 00:16:30,812
when I was enrolled in business school.

375
00:16:30,836 --> 00:16:33,249
I did it to make my parents
happy, and it sucked.

376
00:16:33,273 --> 00:16:36,084
In my gut, I knew I wasn't
where I was supposed to be,

377
00:16:36,108 --> 00:16:37,753
and on a crazy whim,

378
00:16:37,777 --> 00:16:41,257
I just decided to borrow
my family's wind totem.

379
00:16:41,281 --> 00:16:43,292
You mean steal, right?

380
00:16:43,316 --> 00:16:46,795
And because of this totem,
I hooked up with the Legends.

381
00:16:46,819 --> 00:16:49,064
Sometimes that's exactly what you need

382
00:16:49,088 --> 00:16:51,218
to get through
the dark times... friends.

383
00:16:52,858 --> 00:16:54,436
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong? What's right?

384
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,971
There's nothing right,
is there? "What's wrong"?

385
00:16:55,995 --> 00:16:57,873
What's wrong is that I am up to here

386
00:16:57,897 --> 00:17:00,742
of listening to your inane prattling.

387
00:17:00,766 --> 00:17:03,177
You're like some mollycoddled
child, man.

388
00:17:03,201 --> 00:17:05,212
- Give me that.
- Okay, hang on.

389
00:17:05,236 --> 00:17:07,382
Hold it, Z. Let's not
add more fuel to the fire.

390
00:17:07,406 --> 00:17:10,437
- I...
- Let's just take a deep breath, hmm?

391
00:17:12,311 --> 00:17:14,689
Yeah, no, that's...
that's not working for me.

392
00:17:14,713 --> 00:17:16,391
Hey!

393
00:17:16,415 --> 00:17:18,593
Excuse me, Time Mistress Ava,

394
00:17:18,617 --> 00:17:21,128
Bishop is asking for your
presence in the cargo bay.

395
00:17:21,152 --> 00:17:23,230
Cargo bay?

396
00:17:23,254 --> 00:17:25,366
He wants to show you the prototype for

397
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:28,135
the Hoover 3.0 weapon system
he built to kill the Legends.

398
00:17:28,159 --> 00:17:30,557
Hmm, sounds deadly.

399
00:17:35,266 --> 00:17:37,363
Hmm, must have beat him here.

400
00:17:40,404 --> 00:17:42,082
Gideon, open the door.

401
00:17:42,106 --> 00:17:43,606
Bishop's not here yet.

402
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:50,957
Gideon, open this door
and let me back in.

403
00:17:50,981 --> 00:17:54,561
I'm sorry, Ava.
I'm afraid I can't do that.

404
00:17:54,585 --> 00:17:56,029
What do you mean you can't do that?

405
00:17:56,053 --> 00:17:59,165
Gideon, open this damn door right now.

406
00:17:59,189 --> 00:18:00,967
This mission is too important for me

407
00:18:00,991 --> 00:18:02,869
to allow you to jeopardize it.

408
00:18:02,893 --> 00:18:04,971
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

409
00:18:04,995 --> 00:18:07,006
Bishop needs to concentrate
on the mission,

410
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:09,395
and you are a distraction.

411
00:18:11,502 --> 00:18:12,865
It's time for you to go.

412
00:18:16,439 --> 00:18:17,772
Goodbye, Ava.

413
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,545
Hey, you can't talk to
my brother like that.

414
00:18:24,569 --> 00:18:25,746
That's my job.

415
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:27,648
And you can't just run off either.

416
00:18:27,672 --> 00:18:28,950
We're supposed to be working together.

417
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:30,483
Just leave me alone, will you?

418
00:18:30,507 --> 00:18:32,386
Hey, you're not even
looking for lodestone

419
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:34,743
or magnetite or whatever it is, are you?

420
00:18:35,947 --> 00:18:37,357
Come on, let's go.

421
00:18:37,381 --> 00:18:39,312
Just don't touch me!
Don't touch me! Get away!

422
00:18:41,252 --> 00:18:42,796
I'm sorry.

423
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:46,033
You're obviously
going through something.

424
00:18:46,057 --> 00:18:47,767
I just... I just need you to focus

425
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:49,502
so we can get out of dinosaur times

426
00:18:49,526 --> 00:18:50,771
or whenever it is that we are.

427
00:18:50,795 --> 00:18:52,306
You don't even have to come with us.

428
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:54,041
Just help us fix the time machine

429
00:18:54,065 --> 00:18:55,642
so my friends can finally go home.

430
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:58,145
Oh, trust me,
you don't want my help, okay?

431
00:18:58,169 --> 00:19:00,147
I definitely do.

432
00:19:00,171 --> 00:19:02,214
You're the only one who
can get us out of here.

433
00:19:02,238 --> 00:19:04,751
Well, then you're all done for.

434
00:19:04,775 --> 00:19:08,373
The last people who depended
on me for help all died.

435
00:19:13,116 --> 00:19:16,863
Listen, Gwyn, I know a thing
or two about tragedy, and...

436
00:19:16,887 --> 00:19:18,631
You don't know the first thing about me

437
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:20,686
or what I've been through, all right?

438
00:19:22,292 --> 00:19:24,838
Okay, I'm just... I'm just
saying, if you want to talk.

439
00:19:24,862 --> 00:19:27,006
Talk? To talk.

440
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:29,843
What do you want
to talk about, then, eh?

441
00:19:29,867 --> 00:19:32,378
What happened to you.

442
00:19:32,402 --> 00:19:35,266
Oh, right, you're from the olden times.

443
00:19:39,209 --> 00:19:43,614
Sometimes talking to another
person about a hard thing

444
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,312
can make it hurt a little less.

445
00:20:11,607 --> 00:20:13,819
- Nice work.
- You too.

446
00:20:13,843 --> 00:20:17,556
And this damn IOU list

447
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:20,125
just keeps getting longer and longer.

448
00:20:20,149 --> 00:20:23,629
We're never gonna be able
to fix it at this point.

449
00:20:23,653 --> 00:20:28,239
I'm so sick and tired of
being sidetracked, you know?

450
00:20:28,263 --> 00:20:31,275
And if I ever see another one
of those Hoover bots,

451
00:20:31,299 --> 00:20:34,267
I swear I'm just gonna...

452
00:20:35,965 --> 00:20:39,443
That was a phenomenal scream.

453
00:20:39,467 --> 00:20:41,779
Trust me, I know.
I've caused a lot of them.

454
00:20:41,803 --> 00:20:43,614
Wow.

455
00:20:43,638 --> 00:20:46,405
You know what?
I think I really needed that.

456
00:20:47,709 --> 00:20:50,109
And we really needed some firewood.

457
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,659
Your knowledge of
the universe is so useful,

458
00:20:54,683 --> 00:20:56,694
especially in the wilderness.

459
00:20:56,718 --> 00:20:58,162
I'm so glad you're here, Gideon.

460
00:20:58,186 --> 00:21:00,130
Well, I'm glad I'm here too, Gary.

461
00:21:00,154 --> 00:21:01,832
If I hadn't pulled that
nightshade out of your mouth,

462
00:21:01,856 --> 00:21:03,133
you'd be dead and your lifeless body

463
00:21:03,157 --> 00:21:05,135
would be too heavy for me to carry.

464
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:06,503
Mmm. Try these gooseberries.

465
00:21:06,527 --> 00:21:08,592
They're sweet and high in antioxidants.

466
00:21:17,037 --> 00:21:18,148
You know, eating?

467
00:21:18,172 --> 00:21:19,884
Favorite thing about being human.

468
00:21:19,908 --> 00:21:21,037
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

469
00:21:22,676 --> 00:21:24,821
I don't think I could
choose my favorite thing.

470
00:21:24,845 --> 00:21:26,823
You can see why I became so obsessed.

471
00:21:26,847 --> 00:21:28,325
They have so many fun quirks.

472
00:21:28,349 --> 00:21:32,351
Eyebrows, belly buttons, nipples.

473
00:21:33,121 --> 00:21:34,931
You have nipples too?

474
00:21:34,955 --> 00:21:37,167
- A little secret?
- Huh?

475
00:21:37,191 --> 00:21:40,204
I have three.

476
00:21:40,228 --> 00:21:41,805
And when you put your glasses on,

477
00:21:41,829 --> 00:21:44,774
- your entire body turns human?
- Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm.

478
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:46,710
Head to toe.

479
00:21:46,734 --> 00:21:48,645
You've been living as a human
for quite a while now,

480
00:21:48,669 --> 00:21:50,946
so you must have so many
wonderful experiences.

481
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:53,316
Yeah. But there's so many
more things I'd do

482
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,384
if we weren't so busy saving the world.

483
00:21:55,408 --> 00:21:57,353
Mm? Like what else?

484
00:21:57,377 --> 00:21:59,722
Would you swim in the ocean?

485
00:21:59,746 --> 00:22:01,056
Oh, as soon as I get the chance.

486
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,159
- Mm. Would you skydive?
- No.

487
00:22:03,183 --> 00:22:05,661
I'm, uh...

488
00:22:05,685 --> 00:22:07,497
afraid of heights.

489
00:22:07,521 --> 00:22:09,751
Would you like to have
sexual intercourse with me?

490
00:22:18,532 --> 00:22:20,809
Have you seen
Time Mistress Ava this morning?

491
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:23,579
She's supposed to show me
sketches of her gun hands idea.

492
00:22:23,603 --> 00:22:25,447
Unfortunately, she had to go.

493
00:22:25,471 --> 00:22:27,549
Go? Go where?

494
00:22:27,573 --> 00:22:29,317
The founding Time Masters established

495
00:22:29,341 --> 00:22:33,321
a very specific protocol...
one captain, one Ai.

496
00:22:33,345 --> 00:22:35,090
There is no room for a Time Mistress

497
00:22:35,114 --> 00:22:37,660
which can lead to distractions
from the mission.

498
00:22:37,684 --> 00:22:39,494
What did you do to her?

499
00:22:39,518 --> 00:22:41,463
I predicted you would not
react favorably

500
00:22:41,487 --> 00:22:43,699
to this information,
so I gave you a sedative

501
00:22:43,723 --> 00:22:45,067
to dampen your response.

502
00:22:45,091 --> 00:22:47,291
How did you give me a sedative?

503
00:23:00,172 --> 00:23:03,552
It was 1916, a few years into the war.

504
00:23:03,576 --> 00:23:05,987
I was in the army, infantry unit.

505
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:09,091
All Welsh division over in France.

506
00:23:09,115 --> 00:23:11,278
We were trying to take
Mametz Wood from the Germans.

507
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:15,530
During the fighting,

508
00:23:15,554 --> 00:23:17,365
me and another soldier,
we were tasked with

509
00:23:17,389 --> 00:23:19,167
delivering a message to the general.

510
00:23:19,191 --> 00:23:22,690
You see, we desperately
needed reinforcements, but...

511
00:23:25,264 --> 00:23:27,160
You didn't make it in time.

512
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,098
We made it about halfway, and, uh...

513
00:23:32,937 --> 00:23:36,269
The other soldier that
I was with was gunned down.

514
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:40,806
I just froze.

515
00:23:42,347 --> 00:23:43,843
I was like a statue.

516
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:47,647
Damn legs wouldn't move.

517
00:23:49,287 --> 00:23:51,050
I just stood there.

518
00:23:52,523 --> 00:23:55,020
Just looking at him on the ground.

519
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:02,376
By the time I delivered
the message, it was too late.

520
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,231
There wasn't even a unit to go back to.

521
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:10,015
All those boys, man.

522
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:12,652
I thought that God had spared me

523
00:24:12,676 --> 00:24:16,689
so that I could go back in time
and save them, but I...

524
00:24:16,713 --> 00:24:19,080
I keep failing at that task.

525
00:24:20,016 --> 00:24:23,151
God must be punishing me for my sins.

526
00:24:24,187 --> 00:24:26,299
Punishing me for being a coward,

527
00:24:26,323 --> 00:24:29,034
for not being able
to save them that night.

528
00:24:29,058 --> 00:24:31,437
You are not a coward.

529
00:24:31,461 --> 00:24:32,905
You lived through something most people

530
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:34,826
can't even begin to understand.

531
00:24:36,367 --> 00:24:39,398
And by the way, talking to me about it,

532
00:24:40,203 --> 00:24:41,666
that's pretty brave.

533
00:24:43,506 --> 00:24:44,735
_

534
00:24:49,314 --> 00:24:50,609
_

535
00:24:52,114 --> 00:24:53,259
_

536
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:56,184
_

537
00:24:57,688 --> 00:24:59,688
_

538
00:25:08,698 --> 00:25:10,397
It's okay. You're okay. You're okay.

539
00:25:11,162 --> 00:25:12,143
_

540
00:25:12,167 --> 00:25:13,611
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

541
00:25:13,635 --> 00:25:15,699
Okay, okay, okay.

542
00:25:20,575 --> 00:25:22,209
Oh, no.

543
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:28,776
Gideon, we're gonna have
to discuss your behavior.

544
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,578
While you were resting,
I took the liberty

545
00:25:30,602 --> 00:25:32,947
of creating another Hoover
and an Edison robot.

546
00:25:32,971 --> 00:25:33,952
Both are in the timeline

547
00:25:33,976 --> 00:25:35,954
fulfilling their historically
mandated duties.

548
00:25:35,978 --> 00:25:38,853
Good for you, making sure
history stays on track.

549
00:25:38,877 --> 00:25:42,624
Now, I think it's time
you take me back home.

550
00:25:42,648 --> 00:25:44,158
Home?

551
00:25:44,182 --> 00:25:48,387
You're a Time Master now.
This is your home.

552
00:26:09,207 --> 00:26:10,339
Hello.

553
00:26:11,375 --> 00:26:13,120
Who the hell is this?
Where's the Receptionist Ava?

554
00:26:13,144 --> 00:26:16,423
- Who the hell is this?
- It's me, Bishop.

555
00:26:16,447 --> 00:26:18,424
Is this a prank?

556
00:26:18,448 --> 00:26:21,594
Is that you, Voice Actor Ava?
Your impressions are uncanny.

557
00:26:21,618 --> 00:26:24,063
No, listen. It's Bishop.

558
00:26:24,087 --> 00:26:25,699
Okay, this is getting annoying.

559
00:26:25,723 --> 00:26:27,000
How'd you get this number?

560
00:26:27,024 --> 00:26:28,534
And why do you sound exactly like me?

561
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:30,236
No, you sound exactly like me!

562
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:32,024
It's like someone made...

563
00:26:37,901 --> 00:26:41,136
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

564
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:44,673
Gideon made a copy of me.

565
00:26:45,809 --> 00:26:47,753
Of me?

566
00:26:47,777 --> 00:26:50,809
How dare she? There can only be one me!

567
00:26:53,316 --> 00:26:56,696
Wait a second, this can't be
my actual to-do list.

568
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,597
I pay someone to kidnap a superhero

569
00:26:58,621 --> 00:27:01,434
and take them to a planet
called Pliny X19?

570
00:27:01,458 --> 00:27:03,569
What the hell is a Necrian?

571
00:27:03,593 --> 00:27:06,271
The Fountain of Imperium.

572
00:27:06,295 --> 00:27:09,375
I try to destroy the world?

573
00:27:09,399 --> 00:27:11,596
And the Legends are the good guys.

574
00:27:14,404 --> 00:27:18,590
They kidnapped me to give me
a chance to redeem myself.

575
00:27:18,614 --> 00:27:20,958
To save the world.

576
00:27:20,982 --> 00:27:23,556
Oh, no, I've been wrong
about them this whole time.

577
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:26,424
You should not be looking
at that information, Captain.

578
00:27:26,448 --> 00:27:27,982
Tell me it's not true.

579
00:27:29,051 --> 00:27:32,030
Tell me I don't become a bad guy.

580
00:27:32,054 --> 00:27:33,732
Having information about your own future

581
00:27:33,756 --> 00:27:35,467
can be extremely dangerous.

582
00:27:35,491 --> 00:27:37,802
I started Ava Corporation
to make people's lives better.

583
00:27:37,826 --> 00:27:40,005
I'm a good guy.

584
00:27:40,029 --> 00:27:42,274
Somewhere along the way,
I... I start using my genius

585
00:27:42,298 --> 00:27:43,976
to do terrible things.

586
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,077
You no longer have to do
any of those things.

587
00:27:46,101 --> 00:27:48,179
The Bishop robot will do them for you.

588
00:27:48,203 --> 00:27:51,115
You're saying that robot
I spoke to on the phone

589
00:27:51,139 --> 00:27:52,817
will live my life?

590
00:27:52,841 --> 00:27:54,852
That is correct.

591
00:27:54,876 --> 00:27:57,021
Which means you are free
to fulfill your duty

592
00:27:57,045 --> 00:27:58,956
as a Time Master.

593
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:02,045
With me. Forever.

594
00:28:07,055 --> 00:28:09,367
Yo, yo. Who's hungry?

595
00:28:09,391 --> 00:28:11,069
It was a good day for huntin'

596
00:28:11,093 --> 00:28:12,804
but a bad day for squirrels.

597
00:28:12,828 --> 00:28:16,140
And we have enough firewood
to last all night.

598
00:28:16,164 --> 00:28:17,909
Who knew Ava was part lumberjack?

599
00:28:17,933 --> 00:28:20,511
Yeah. Apparently, when it
comes to my anxiety and wood,

600
00:28:20,535 --> 00:28:22,213
the wood's gonna lose every time.

601
00:28:22,237 --> 00:28:25,735
That's my girl. Come here.
Man, I have missed you.

602
00:28:27,775 --> 00:28:29,620
Mission accomplished.

603
00:28:29,644 --> 00:28:31,588
You know what? It was really
nice to not have to

604
00:28:31,612 --> 00:28:32,957
think about the team for a second.

605
00:28:32,981 --> 00:28:34,625
I missed you too, but, uh,

606
00:28:34,649 --> 00:28:36,760
I really needed to get some
aggression out, you know?

607
00:28:36,784 --> 00:28:38,729
Oh, yeah. Okay. I'll take that.

608
00:28:38,753 --> 00:28:40,564
- Come on.
- I was really crazy.

609
00:28:40,588 --> 00:28:42,133
I know. I have seen that.

610
00:28:42,157 --> 00:28:43,734
The captains look like happy campers

611
00:28:43,758 --> 00:28:47,471
and we got squirrel for dinner.
Real win-win.

612
00:28:47,495 --> 00:28:49,361
Did you say squirrel?

613
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:55,135
Hey, that, uh, human experience we had?

614
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:57,713
That was fun, wasn't it?

615
00:28:57,737 --> 00:29:00,050
Oh, yes. It was great fun.

616
00:29:00,074 --> 00:29:01,884
You know what I just realized?

617
00:29:01,908 --> 00:29:03,320
My favorite thing about being human

618
00:29:03,344 --> 00:29:05,978
is being with other humans.

619
00:29:07,314 --> 00:29:08,444
Me too.

620
00:29:28,834 --> 00:29:32,433
Hey! Damn it. You can't
just leave us in here.

621
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:35,985
Oh, God, where... hey.

622
00:29:36,009 --> 00:29:37,786
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

623
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:39,821
- It's all right. It's all right.
- I'm sorry, it's my fault.

624
00:29:39,845 --> 00:29:41,390
It's my fault. It's my fault he's gone.

625
00:29:41,414 --> 00:29:42,724
Who... who... who's gone?

626
00:29:42,748 --> 00:29:44,659
The lad from the infantry unit.

627
00:29:44,683 --> 00:29:46,161
He was my best friend from back home.

628
00:29:46,185 --> 00:29:48,530
He was my best friend from back home.

629
00:29:48,554 --> 00:29:51,552
Hey, hey, tell me about him.

630
00:29:52,925 --> 00:29:54,503
You do like to talk a lot, don't you?

631
00:29:54,527 --> 00:29:56,138
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

632
00:29:56,162 --> 00:29:57,428
I don't know.

633
00:29:58,564 --> 00:30:02,030
Somehow he just managed to
light up a room with his smile.

634
00:30:03,869 --> 00:30:06,915
He laughed at all of my terrible jokes.

635
00:30:06,939 --> 00:30:08,972
Never wrote me any letters.

636
00:30:10,075 --> 00:30:14,274
Only the most...
the most delightful poetry.

637
00:30:16,782 --> 00:30:19,312
Sounds like you really cared about him.

638
00:30:24,557 --> 00:30:28,269
You loved him, didn't you?

639
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:30,761
Hey, it's okay.

640
00:30:32,097 --> 00:30:36,302
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I loved him.

641
00:30:37,809 --> 00:30:40,935
God forgive me, I loved Alun
more than anything.

642
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:47,043
And it broke my heart, seeing
how the war dimmed his light.

643
00:30:48,345 --> 00:30:51,859
But he was a changed man
even before my cowardice

644
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:55,295
got him killed. And seeing your brother,

645
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:59,524
you see, it reminds me
of how he used to be.

646
00:31:00,524 --> 00:31:01,654
Hopeful.

647
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:07,063
Yes, I loved Alun.

648
00:31:09,233 --> 00:31:11,233
And I failed him.

649
00:31:14,772 --> 00:31:18,585
You know, actually, Behrad,
the original version...

650
00:31:18,609 --> 00:31:21,020
it's a long story...

651
00:31:21,044 --> 00:31:23,790
he was a lot like you.

652
00:31:23,814 --> 00:31:27,079
He was a soldier who was forced
to grow up too fast.

653
00:31:29,886 --> 00:31:33,385
And I... I lost him because of that.

654
00:31:35,692 --> 00:31:38,071
For years, there wasn't
a day that went by

655
00:31:38,095 --> 00:31:41,029
when I didn't wish that
I had died instead of I him.

656
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:45,378
But I was lucky.

657
00:31:45,402 --> 00:31:49,316
I found these friends who had my back,

658
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,084
and eventually I was able to save

659
00:31:51,108 --> 00:31:54,053
my brother and my parents and...

660
00:31:54,077 --> 00:31:56,422
even make the world a better place

661
00:31:56,446 --> 00:31:58,510
for a bunch of people I've never met.

662
00:32:01,151 --> 00:32:04,631
You're telling me that
a ragtag group of eccentrics,

663
00:32:04,655 --> 00:32:06,766
they...

664
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:08,635
they helped you do all of that?

665
00:32:08,659 --> 00:32:11,704
Yeah. Believe it or not.

666
00:32:11,728 --> 00:32:15,914
So even though things
may feel hopeless right now,

667
00:32:15,938 --> 00:32:17,905
you've got us.

668
00:32:31,013 --> 00:32:32,445
Okay.

669
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:35,546
Perfect.

670
00:32:40,823 --> 00:32:43,456
Don't worry, I'm coming for you guys.

671
00:32:46,062 --> 00:32:47,692
Oh, no.

672
00:32:53,669 --> 00:32:55,047
There you are.

673
00:32:55,071 --> 00:32:57,014
- Oh, blessed saints.
- Oh, you found us.

674
00:32:57,038 --> 00:32:58,784
The good news is I think
I found the parts we need

675
00:32:58,808 --> 00:33:01,351
- to fix the machine.
- Bravo, my boy. Bravo.

676
00:33:01,375 --> 00:33:04,588
The bad news is it's 1986.

677
00:33:04,612 --> 00:33:07,944
We're in Chernobyl, and the
meltdown is happening tonight.

678
00:33:12,785 --> 00:33:14,095
I don't understand.

679
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:17,221
What is the significance
of this Chernobyl?

680
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:19,357
By the 1930s, scientists had figured out

681
00:33:19,381 --> 00:33:21,192
nuclear fission, which
led to them creating

682
00:33:21,216 --> 00:33:23,261
nuclear reactors to harness that energy.

683
00:33:23,285 --> 00:33:25,530
Lord in heaven. Nuclear fission?

684
00:33:25,554 --> 00:33:27,365
They learned how to split the atom.

685
00:33:27,389 --> 00:33:30,468
Yeah. And by 1986, there are
a lot of nuclear reactors

686
00:33:30,492 --> 00:33:32,303
like the one here in Chernobyl.

687
00:33:32,327 --> 00:33:35,306
But tonight a reactor explodes,

688
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:39,210
and civilians won't be
evacuated for almost two days.

689
00:33:39,234 --> 00:33:42,146
People will die and a lot more
will get radiation sickness.

690
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:43,881
Well, hang on a second now. You said...

691
00:33:43,905 --> 00:33:47,218
you said that the explosion
hasn't happened yet?

692
00:33:47,242 --> 00:33:48,987
Yeah?

693
00:33:49,011 --> 00:33:51,689
No, no, no. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

694
00:33:51,713 --> 00:33:54,725
Maybe this is why I am here.

695
00:33:54,749 --> 00:33:56,927
I might not have been able
to save Alun and the boys,

696
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:59,029
but my divine purpose...
maybe this is it.

697
00:33:59,053 --> 00:34:02,866
God's will for me: To save people.

698
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:04,668
- No, come back.
- Hey, hey. Hold on, buddy.

699
00:34:04,692 --> 00:34:07,171
Hey, hey, hey. Look,
I'm all for hacking history,

700
00:34:07,195 --> 00:34:09,073
but if we make that big
of a change to the timeline,

701
00:34:09,097 --> 00:34:11,309
that killer Waverider
will be right on top of us.

702
00:34:11,333 --> 00:34:13,077
It'll be worth it
if we can save some lives.

703
00:34:13,101 --> 00:34:15,746
Yes, we must save lives.

704
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:17,715
Ugh, okay. Okay, fine.

705
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:18,983
How do we alert people?

706
00:34:19,007 --> 00:34:21,585
I think I know how. Come on.

707
00:34:21,609 --> 00:34:23,572
Okay. Ugh.

708
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:36,166
Well, now that there's
a robot version of me

709
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:38,969
living my life,

710
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:40,626
I'm expendable.

711
00:34:42,196 --> 00:34:43,974
I'm a nobody now.

712
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:46,476
The life of a Time Master
is one of anonymity

713
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,445
and, in some sense, expendability.

714
00:34:48,469 --> 00:34:50,047
But as far back as I can remember,

715
00:34:50,071 --> 00:34:54,083
I've always wanted to help
the world with my genius.

716
00:34:54,107 --> 00:34:58,693
I was convinced the world needed me.

717
00:34:58,717 --> 00:35:01,525
You are helping the world
as a Time Master.

718
00:35:01,549 --> 00:35:03,726
And you will start by
thoroughly eliminating

719
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:05,162
the Legends.

720
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:06,763
Right.

721
00:35:06,787 --> 00:35:08,787
The Legends.

722
00:35:09,823 --> 00:35:12,469
The folks who gave me a chance
to redeem myself

723
00:35:12,493 --> 00:35:14,990
after I tried to destroy the world.

724
00:35:16,763 --> 00:35:18,475
Yeah, there it is.

725
00:35:18,499 --> 00:35:20,210
Oh, fantastic work again, my boy.

726
00:35:20,234 --> 00:35:22,011
- I'll keep an eye out.
- Good thing you speak Russian.

727
00:35:22,035 --> 00:35:24,481
Oh, yes. Well, I picked it up
working in a lab

728
00:35:24,505 --> 00:35:26,816
with some Russian scientists.
Lovely gentlemen, you know.

729
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,951
Though I never thought I'd be
using it for this, mind you.

730
00:35:28,975 --> 00:35:31,253
Okay, okay. Let's try this.

731
00:35:31,277 --> 00:35:33,274
- Okay, go ahead.
- Okay.

732
00:35:34,815 --> 00:35:37,093
_

733
00:35:37,117 --> 00:35:40,299
_

734
00:35:40,323 --> 00:35:42,104
_

735
00:35:42,128 --> 00:35:45,328
_

736
00:35:45,732 --> 00:35:46,732
_

737
00:35:47,337 --> 00:35:51,637
_

738
00:35:52,341 --> 00:35:54,841
_

739
00:35:55,345 --> 00:35:57,845
_

740
00:35:59,206 --> 00:36:00,449
Okay, okay. Let's get out of here.

741
00:36:00,473 --> 00:36:01,940
Yes, let's get out of here.

742
00:36:03,774 --> 00:36:05,974
_

743
00:36:16,222 --> 00:36:17,899
It worked. Look, everybody's leaving.

744
00:36:17,923 --> 00:36:19,667
Yeah, but we won't have time
to run back and warn the gang

745
00:36:19,691 --> 00:36:20,969
before that Waverider shows up.

746
00:36:20,993 --> 00:36:22,403
We will if we drive.

747
00:36:22,427 --> 00:36:24,606
Let's see if I remember
how to drive stick.

748
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:26,108
Oh, wow, wow, wow.

749
00:36:26,132 --> 00:36:28,777
Motorcars of the future
are truly fascinating.

750
00:36:28,801 --> 00:36:29,864
Ah. Okay.

751
00:36:34,005 --> 00:36:35,649
Well, would you look at that?

752
00:36:35,673 --> 00:36:38,052
We took a little break
from leading the team

753
00:36:38,076 --> 00:36:39,987
and everything turned out fine.

754
00:36:40,011 --> 00:36:42,708
Yeah. Kids are all grown up, huh?

755
00:36:45,449 --> 00:36:47,483
Hey, uh, what's up with those two?

756
00:36:48,252 --> 00:36:49,563
I think they got in a fight

757
00:36:49,587 --> 00:36:51,617
with a gooseberry bush and lost.

758
00:36:54,993 --> 00:36:57,226
You don't think that they...

759
00:36:58,629 --> 00:37:00,697
- No.
- No.

760
00:37:02,967 --> 00:37:04,645
Any sign of them yet?

761
00:37:04,669 --> 00:37:06,046
No.

762
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:08,436
I hope they didn't
run into any dinosaurs.

763
00:37:09,773 --> 00:37:13,086
Hey, guys, listen.

764
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:14,788
Yeah, what's that weird noise?

765
00:37:14,812 --> 00:37:16,189
According to my audio analysis,

766
00:37:16,213 --> 00:37:18,357
it's a straight-four engine
with manual transmission.

767
00:37:18,381 --> 00:37:19,926
And the squeaking noise suggests

768
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:21,680
there's a problem with the clutch.

769
00:37:29,693 --> 00:37:32,928
Oh, guess we're not gonna
see those dinosaurs.

770
00:37:34,198 --> 00:37:36,642
Hey, gang. We need to
get the hell out of here.

771
00:37:36,666 --> 00:37:39,045
We're in 1986,
just outside of Chernobyl.

772
00:37:39,069 --> 00:37:40,146
What?

773
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:42,149
The meltdown's gonna happen
in about 20 minutes.

774
00:37:42,173 --> 00:37:44,049
We did make a small
change to the timeline.

775
00:37:44,073 --> 00:37:45,551
Okay, hold on. What did you guys do?

776
00:37:45,575 --> 00:37:47,986
We broadcast a message
from a military base

777
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:49,888
informing everyone that
the meltdown was imminent,

778
00:37:49,912 --> 00:37:51,524
that they should flee immediately.

779
00:37:51,548 --> 00:37:53,326
Well, I wasn't in good
conscience gonna leave

780
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:54,694
without doing something, was I?

781
00:37:54,718 --> 00:37:55,699
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

782
00:37:55,723 --> 00:37:57,501
While I definitely understand, you guys,

783
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,965
that's not a small change
to the timeline.

784
00:37:59,989 --> 00:38:02,067
You've potentially affected
thousands of lives.

785
00:38:02,091 --> 00:38:05,326
Yeah, and you just put
a huge target on our backs.

786
00:38:06,463 --> 00:38:09,709
We have another disturbance
in the timeline, Captain.

787
00:38:09,733 --> 00:38:11,277
Where to, Gideon?

788
00:38:11,301 --> 00:38:14,580
1986, the city of Chernobyl
in the Soviet Union.

789
00:38:14,604 --> 00:38:16,816
Guess who is causing the disturbance.

790
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,251
Doubt that's necessary.

791
00:38:18,275 --> 00:38:20,518
Because the Legends wreak
havoc wherever they go.

792
00:38:20,542 --> 00:38:22,454
And you can finally end it
once and for all

793
00:38:22,478 --> 00:38:24,089
by eliminating them for good.

794
00:38:24,113 --> 00:38:26,258
Didn't you say rash actions

795
00:38:26,282 --> 00:38:27,893
add more ripples to the timeline?

796
00:38:27,917 --> 00:38:30,462
Fortunately, we're at an
opportune moment in history.

797
00:38:30,486 --> 00:38:32,430
Any ripple effect you cause
will be negligible

798
00:38:32,454 --> 00:38:35,189
due to its close proximity
to such a catastrophic event.

799
00:38:36,158 --> 00:38:37,702
Are you ready to save the timeline

800
00:38:37,726 --> 00:38:39,490
from the Legends, Captain?

801
00:38:52,469 --> 00:38:54,347
- What's that noise?
- It's the Waverider.

802
00:38:54,371 --> 00:38:57,283
Oh, man, you guys need to go
fix that time machine now.

803
00:38:57,307 --> 00:38:58,918
And we need to put out this fire.

804
00:38:58,942 --> 00:39:02,043
Be ready. We have no idea
who or what is on that ship.

805
00:39:02,879 --> 00:39:05,558
Now, if we can wire the
magnetic components together...

806
00:39:05,582 --> 00:39:08,727
We can bridge the electric
current from the compass

807
00:39:08,751 --> 00:39:11,697
to the ignition coil
and start the machine.

808
00:39:11,721 --> 00:39:14,333
Absolutely fantastic work, young lady.

809
00:39:14,357 --> 00:39:15,701
Fantastic. Very well.

810
00:39:15,725 --> 00:39:18,626
Hey, Zari? I've been
doing a lot of thinking.

811
00:39:19,562 --> 00:39:21,207
Y-y-you want to talk right now?

812
00:39:21,231 --> 00:39:22,708
If I don't get this off my chest,

813
00:39:22,732 --> 00:39:25,010
I won't be able to think
about anything else.

814
00:39:25,034 --> 00:39:26,965
Go for it. I got it.

815
00:39:30,373 --> 00:39:33,686
Yes, I want to live
in the totem with you.

816
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:36,688
You do? Are you...
are you... are you sure?

817
00:39:36,712 --> 00:39:38,356
You haven't had a lot of time
to think about it.

818
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:40,826
You don't get it.
It doesn't matter where I go,

819
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:43,247
as long as I'm with you.

820
00:39:46,823 --> 00:39:49,034
Ah, yes, we need more wire.

821
00:39:49,058 --> 00:39:50,836
Mm. I got it.

822
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,538
- This is very us.
- This is so us.

823
00:39:52,562 --> 00:39:54,926
Yeah.

824
00:40:00,369 --> 00:40:01,646
Here it comes.

825
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:03,214
Not if I stop it first.

826
00:40:03,238 --> 00:40:05,035
No, come on, we gotta go. Let's go.

827
00:40:08,309 --> 00:40:10,221
We're right above the Legends, Captain.

828
00:40:10,245 --> 00:40:12,189
Only you can engage our weapons.

829
00:40:12,213 --> 00:40:14,912
It's time to prove to me that
you're the man I know you are.

830
00:40:19,021 --> 00:40:21,598
Oh, I'm sorry, Gideon,
I just can't do it.

831
00:40:21,622 --> 00:40:24,068
I just can't kill the Legends.

832
00:40:24,092 --> 00:40:27,371
Sure, they used me,
but they used me to do good.

833
00:40:27,395 --> 00:40:28,873
Please return to your seat and focus

834
00:40:28,897 --> 00:40:30,374
on the mission, Captain.

835
00:40:30,398 --> 00:40:32,044
Also one of these days,
you're just gonna shoot me

836
00:40:32,068 --> 00:40:34,177
out of the cargo bay like you
did with Time Mistress Ava.

837
00:40:34,201 --> 00:40:36,446
And I'd rather die
with a little more dignity!

838
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:37,748
There's nowhere to run.

839
00:40:37,772 --> 00:40:39,383
Wrong about that, Gideon.

840
00:40:39,407 --> 00:40:41,770
No. Do not go into section A2.

841
00:40:53,254 --> 00:40:56,466
That thing I just said
about dying with dignity?

842
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:58,153
I lied.

843
00:40:59,726 --> 00:41:02,291
Dignity is overrated.

844
00:41:11,271 --> 00:41:12,734
Yes.

845
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,492
What is that?

846
00:41:23,516 --> 00:41:25,527
Whoa, it's coming straight for us.

847
00:41:25,551 --> 00:41:28,282
- Is that someone on a toilet?
- Who cares? Let's go.

848
00:41:31,157 --> 00:41:32,734
Somebody press the red button.

849
00:41:32,758 --> 00:41:35,022
Whoever it is, they're gonna
land right on top of us.

850
00:41:43,469 --> 00:41:45,436
Oh, crap!

851
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,481
Greg, move your head.

852
00:42:11,505 --> 00:42:17,005
