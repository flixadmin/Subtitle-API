1
00:00:08,498 --> 00:00:10,498
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:10,499 --> 00:00:13,567
To my family, I am the brother and son

3
00:00:13,569 --> 00:00:17,588
who just returned home after
being lost at sea 5 years ago.

4
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:19,757
They don't know I came back with a mission,

5
00:00:19,759 --> 00:00:22,409
to bring justice to our city,

6
00:00:22,411 --> 00:00:27,431
and they never can.

7
00:00:27,433 --> 00:00:31,636
The men and women I've
targeted are dangerous, corrupt,

8
00:00:31,638 --> 00:00:35,022
a virulent cancer.

9
00:00:37,943 --> 00:00:40,645
Cancers like James Holder,

10
00:00:40,647 --> 00:00:44,031
whose corporation put
defective smoke detectors

11
00:00:44,033 --> 00:00:47,535
in low-income housing in The Glades.

12
00:00:47,537 --> 00:00:52,406
There have been many fires
and too many funerals.

13
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:01,249
But cancers can be fought and conquered.

14
00:01:01,251 --> 00:01:04,952
All it takes is a surgeon...

15
00:01:04,954 --> 00:01:06,721
and the right instrument.

16
00:01:12,094 --> 00:01:13,928
Heh.

17
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:15,897
Other than the bill I got handed

18
00:01:15,899 --> 00:01:17,281
this morning by my legal team,

19
00:01:17,283 --> 00:01:18,649
I'm feeling pretty good.

20
00:01:18,651 --> 00:01:20,651
Plus, now that this lawsuit's been settled,

21
00:01:20,653 --> 00:01:23,470
we can focus our attention
on Unidac Industries.

22
00:01:23,472 --> 00:01:26,240
Ok.

23
00:01:26,242 --> 00:01:28,409
I'll see you in the office first thing.

24
00:01:36,428 --> 00:01:38,429
I have armed security inside.

25
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,014
All I have to do is call out.

26
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:41,482
Go ahead.

27
00:01:41,484 --> 00:01:43,150
They can't hear you.

28
00:01:45,604 --> 00:01:47,188
What the hell do you want?

29
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,357
How many people died in those fires?

30
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,859
How many?!

31
00:01:54,446 --> 00:01:57,048
The courts say you don't
owe your victims anything.

32
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,250
I disagree.

33
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:00,318
James Holder...

34
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,752
You...

35
00:02:21,367 --> 00:02:25,367
<font color=#00FF00>1x03</font>
<font color=#00FF00> Lone Gunmen</font>

36
00:02:52,477 --> 00:02:54,547
It's no surprise a
man as corrupt as James Holder

37
00:02:54,548 --> 00:02:56,267
has more than one enemy.

38
00:03:11,523 --> 00:03:14,602
The bullet. Poison.

39
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:30,125
Ahh.

40
00:03:47,677 --> 00:03:51,379
Who are you?

41
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,685
Why did you shoot me?

42
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:21,209
Aah!

43
00:04:43,236 --> 00:04:45,604
What happened? Thea ok?

44
00:04:45,606 --> 00:04:47,306
The cops brought her home.

45
00:04:47,308 --> 00:04:49,241
Her and some of her
friends broke into a store,

46
00:04:49,243 --> 00:04:51,527
tried on some dresses last night.

47
00:04:51,529 --> 00:04:55,948
Lit up the breathalyzer
like a Christmas tree.

48
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:58,250
So how was your evening, sir?

49
00:04:58,252 --> 00:04:59,919
You mean after I said I
had to go to the bathroom

50
00:04:59,921 --> 00:05:01,670
at dinner and never came back?

51
00:05:01,672 --> 00:05:05,941
I guess from now on
I'll be watching you pee.

52
00:05:09,512 --> 00:05:12,548
Thank you, officers.
My wife and I appreciate it.

53
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,016
I'll see you out.

54
00:05:18,221 --> 00:05:20,556
Last time it was public intoxication.

55
00:05:20,558 --> 00:05:22,057
This time breaking and entering.

56
00:05:22,059 --> 00:05:24,893
My, how we are moving
up in the criminal world.

57
00:05:24,895 --> 00:05:27,313
You know, when you pay off the store owner,

58
00:05:27,315 --> 00:05:29,097
you should check out the merchandise.

59
00:05:29,099 --> 00:05:30,983
They got some pretty killer outfits.

60
00:05:30,985 --> 00:05:32,985
Thea, go get ready for school.

61
00:05:32,987 --> 00:05:37,222
Uh, you know, I was thinking
of taking a sick day.

62
00:05:37,224 --> 00:05:41,777
Fine, then get some sleep.

63
00:05:45,799 --> 00:05:47,750
You look like crap.

64
00:05:49,386 --> 00:05:51,053
You're letting her play hooky?

65
00:05:51,055 --> 00:05:52,755
When your sister gets like this,

66
00:05:52,757 --> 00:05:54,173
it's best to give her her space.

67
00:05:54,175 --> 00:05:55,758
She's testing you.

68
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,977
Yes. Who'd she learn that from?

69
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:02,264
Mom.

70
00:06:02,266 --> 00:06:05,234
When I was her age, you and
dad let me get away with murder.

71
00:06:05,236 --> 00:06:07,653
Looking back, I could have used less space

72
00:06:07,655 --> 00:06:09,638
and more parenting.

73
00:06:17,697 --> 00:06:19,581
It doesn't make sense.

74
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:21,817
Holder fits the profile. Wealthy dirtbag.

75
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:23,635
Red meat for the hood.

76
00:06:23,637 --> 00:06:25,037
And we recovered at least one arrow.

77
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,822
Yeah, only this time the cause of death

78
00:06:26,824 --> 00:06:28,207
is a double tap through the heart

79
00:06:28,209 --> 00:06:30,125
and our perp doesn't use firearms.

80
00:06:30,127 --> 00:06:32,061
Maybe he's finally figured
out there's easier ways

81
00:06:32,063 --> 00:06:34,296
to kill people than with a bow and arrow.

82
00:06:34,298 --> 00:06:38,033
It's like you said, the guy's a whackjob.

83
00:06:57,487 --> 00:06:59,822
The bullets were laced with curare,

84
00:06:59,824 --> 00:07:02,207
a rare and deadly poison,

85
00:07:02,209 --> 00:07:06,528
the killer's unique M.O.

86
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:08,130
He's killed all over the world...

87
00:07:08,132 --> 00:07:11,300
Chicago, Markovia, Corto Maltese.

88
00:07:11,302 --> 00:07:13,786
Interpol even has a codename for him...

89
00:07:13,788 --> 00:07:15,838
Deadshot.

90
00:07:16,973 --> 00:07:19,475
I was prepared to give
James Holder a chance

91
00:07:19,477 --> 00:07:23,211
to right his wrongs, but this
Deadshot has no morality,

92
00:07:23,213 --> 00:07:26,815
no honor, no code.

93
00:07:26,817 --> 00:07:28,684
He doesn't kill for justice,

94
00:07:28,686 --> 00:07:31,937
which makes him as dangerous
as anyone on my list.

95
00:07:31,939 --> 00:07:37,326
In fact, it puts him right at the top.

96
00:07:49,654 --> 00:07:51,288
So what do you think?

97
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:52,689
Great spot for a nightclub or what?

98
00:07:52,691 --> 00:07:55,242
Sweet. Though I got to tell you, man,

99
00:07:55,244 --> 00:07:56,744
if you're thinking about calling it Queens,

100
00:07:56,746 --> 00:07:58,328
I don't think you're
gonna get the clientele

101
00:07:58,330 --> 00:07:59,379
that you were hoping for.

102
00:07:59,381 --> 00:08:00,914
Private office.

103
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:03,366
For the private one-on-one
meetings, I would imagine.

104
00:08:03,368 --> 00:08:05,669
Hopefully the occasional
two-on-one meeting.

105
00:08:07,506 --> 00:08:09,706
Man, are you sure you want to do this?

106
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:12,142
It's not like you really
have any experience

107
00:08:12,144 --> 00:08:16,447
in running a... well, running anything.

108
00:08:16,449 --> 00:08:18,982
How about tomorrow night the two of us,

109
00:08:18,984 --> 00:08:20,234
we go and scope out the competition.

110
00:08:20,236 --> 00:08:22,136
There's a new club opening downtown.

111
00:08:22,138 --> 00:08:24,438
It's called Poison. Max Fuller owns it.

112
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,306
- Max Fuller?
- Mm-hmm.

113
00:08:26,308 --> 00:08:28,008
I slept with his fiancée.

114
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:29,159
Yeah, before the wedding.

115
00:08:29,161 --> 00:08:30,694
It was at the rehearsal dinner.

116
00:08:30,696 --> 00:08:33,163
The rehearsal dinner is
technically before the wedding.

117
00:08:33,165 --> 00:08:34,531
Right?

118
00:08:34,533 --> 00:08:36,950
And besides, who stays mad at a castaway?

119
00:08:36,952 --> 00:08:39,536
Ah, dammit, I got to roll.

120
00:08:39,538 --> 00:08:40,904
Anyway, I'll see you later, man.

121
00:08:40,906 --> 00:08:42,072
Good place.

122
00:08:42,074 --> 00:08:43,841
See you.

123
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:50,547
So... what do you think?

124
00:08:50,549 --> 00:08:52,716
Well, I'm here to provide
security, sir, not a commentary.

125
00:08:52,718 --> 00:08:54,551
Oh, come on, dig, do me a favor.

126
00:08:54,553 --> 00:08:58,472
Speak freely, please.

127
00:08:58,474 --> 00:09:01,258
Well, this is The Glades, right?

128
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:04,228
Your rich white friends wouldn't
come to this neighborhood on a bet.

129
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:06,280
I am Oliver Queen, right?

130
00:09:06,282 --> 00:09:10,067
People would stand in line
for 3 hours if I opened a club.

131
00:09:10,069 --> 00:09:11,768
And no one who actually lives in The Glades

132
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:13,370
would see a penny of those cover charges.

133
00:09:13,372 --> 00:09:14,855
So we make it a successful business,

134
00:09:14,857 --> 00:09:16,874
we gentrify the neighborhood.

135
00:09:16,876 --> 00:09:20,377
I was wondering when we would get to that.

136
00:09:20,379 --> 00:09:24,164
The white knight swooping in
to save the disenfranchised.

137
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:27,634
And all by his lonesome
with no help from anybody.

138
00:09:27,636 --> 00:09:29,253
Wow.

139
00:09:29,255 --> 00:09:31,455
You don't think very much of me, do you?

140
00:09:31,457 --> 00:09:34,308
No, sir, actually, I
have a very high regard

141
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:36,793
for how perceptive you are.

142
00:09:38,213 --> 00:09:39,730
Sir.

143
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:51,855
The nightclub will
conceal my base underneath

144
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:54,775
and provide an alibi for where
Oliver Queen spends his nights.

145
00:10:01,275 --> 00:10:02,925
Hey.

146
00:10:02,927 --> 00:10:04,594
Do you have the depos on the Jergens case?

147
00:10:04,596 --> 00:10:07,113
Yeah, they're around here somewhere.

148
00:10:08,932 --> 00:10:12,268
I was just surfing the 'net.

149
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,204
Really?

150
00:10:13,205 --> 00:10:16,206
Joanna, I'm over him.

151
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,458
And you don't believe me.

152
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,994
Well, I would have if I
wouldn't have just caught you

153
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:22,546
trolling for articles on him!

154
00:10:22,548 --> 00:10:24,531
I wasn't trolling! I don't want to have

155
00:10:24,533 --> 00:10:27,534
to be the one to remind you
that he cheated on you, Laurel.

156
00:10:27,536 --> 00:10:29,302
With your sister.

157
00:10:29,304 --> 00:10:32,139
I appreciate your self control.

158
00:10:32,141 --> 00:10:34,341
You're stuck in the past.
And the reason I know this

159
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:36,676
is the fact that the
only physical relationship

160
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:39,479
you've had since Oliver
is with his best friend.

161
00:10:39,481 --> 00:10:41,515
It is time to move on.

162
00:10:41,517 --> 00:10:43,934
It is past time.

163
00:10:43,936 --> 00:10:45,519
I've been busy.

164
00:10:45,521 --> 00:10:46,987
I work a lot.

165
00:10:46,989 --> 00:10:48,721
Ok.

166
00:10:48,723 --> 00:10:49,773
That's got to stop.

167
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:51,291
So we are going out tonight.

168
00:10:51,293 --> 00:10:53,027
And... and we are going
to have some shots

169
00:10:53,229 --> 00:10:54,995
and we are going to dance
with men that we don't know

170
00:10:54,997 --> 00:10:57,164
and we are going to
stay out way too late.

171
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:59,666
Oh!

172
00:10:59,668 --> 00:11:02,318
Jergens depos.

173
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,288
I really don't think I can go out tonight.

174
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:09,926
It is adorable that you actually
think I'm giving you a choice.

175
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:19,157
I want you to come home right after school.

176
00:11:19,158 --> 00:11:22,075
Oh, can't. Margot and I
are going to go to the mall.

177
00:11:22,077 --> 00:11:24,878
What, more shopping?

178
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,413
Tell Margot you'll have to cancel.

179
00:11:26,415 --> 00:11:28,748
You're grounded for two weeks.

180
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,950
Grounded?

181
00:11:30,952 --> 00:11:32,903
I've never been grounded.

182
00:11:32,905 --> 00:11:35,255
Well, you've never
committed larceny before.

183
00:11:35,257 --> 00:11:38,425
Since when do you care?

184
00:11:38,427 --> 00:11:40,677
I've always cared. I'm your mother.

185
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:43,930
Look, we've had a good thing
going on the last five years.

186
00:11:43,932 --> 00:11:45,098
Why mess with that now?

187
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,650
No, we are paying off store owners

188
00:11:46,652 --> 00:11:48,134
to keep your record clean,

189
00:11:48,136 --> 00:11:49,402
so clearly, it hasn't been working.

190
00:11:49,404 --> 00:11:51,655
And you're going to teach me.

191
00:11:51,657 --> 00:11:54,241
It's Oliver, isn't it?

192
00:11:54,243 --> 00:11:57,310
His judgmental hypocrisy
is rubbing off on you.

193
00:11:57,312 --> 00:12:00,146
No, I don't need Oliver to
teach me how to parent you.

194
00:12:00,148 --> 00:12:01,665
You'll be home by 4:00.

195
00:12:01,667 --> 00:12:03,617
Or what?

196
00:12:03,619 --> 00:12:05,785
You're going to call the cops on me?

197
00:12:05,787 --> 00:12:08,922
Tell them I say hi.

198
00:13:16,741 --> 00:13:19,910
Got ballistics back on the Holder murder.

199
00:13:19,912 --> 00:13:23,663
They pulled two 7.62
millimeter bullets out of him.

200
00:13:23,665 --> 00:13:25,465
According to the stippling
and size of the entry wound,

201
00:13:25,467 --> 00:13:26,967
they estimate the shots were fired

202
00:13:26,969 --> 00:13:28,868
from approximately a hundred yards away.

203
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,504
A hundred yards?

204
00:13:30,506 --> 00:13:33,340
What, so the hood shoots
him from another building,

205
00:13:33,342 --> 00:13:34,591
goes over to his place,
he takes out his security,

206
00:13:34,593 --> 00:13:36,877
and then he fires off a few arrows?

207
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:38,462
And according to his tox screen,

208
00:13:38,464 --> 00:13:40,046
his blood contained
high concentrations

209
00:13:40,048 --> 00:13:41,848
of strychnos toxifera.

210
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:43,316
- What?
- Curare.

211
00:13:43,318 --> 00:13:44,434
It's a kind of poison.

212
00:13:44,436 --> 00:13:46,353
Oh. Ok, so now we switch from arrows

213
00:13:46,355 --> 00:13:48,105
to sniper bullets and poison.

214
00:13:48,107 --> 00:13:50,223
I'm not buying it.

215
00:13:50,225 --> 00:13:52,892
We still found arrows on the scene.

216
00:13:52,894 --> 00:13:54,161
Solid evidence the hood was there.

217
00:13:54,163 --> 00:13:56,580
Where you going?

218
00:13:56,582 --> 00:13:59,566
I'm going to get my own evidence.

219
00:14:12,096 --> 00:14:15,015
7.62 millimeter rounds.

220
00:14:15,017 --> 00:14:17,701
The money trail leads back to the Bratva...

221
00:14:17,703 --> 00:14:19,503
the Russian mob.

222
00:14:19,505 --> 00:14:23,106
Finally... some good luck.

223
00:15:45,816 --> 00:15:48,518
Pleased to meet you.

224
00:15:52,373 --> 00:15:55,191
I apologize.

225
00:15:55,193 --> 00:15:57,527
We meant no disrespect

226
00:15:57,529 --> 00:16:00,630
to a captain.

227
00:16:00,632 --> 00:16:04,501
Particularly an American one.

228
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:09,005
So...

229
00:16:09,007 --> 00:16:11,558
How can I be of assistance?

230
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,511
I'm in the market for a hired gun.

231
00:16:13,512 --> 00:16:15,529
Someone the organization's used before.

232
00:16:15,531 --> 00:16:19,566
His calling card is a 7.62
millimeter gun laced with curare.

233
00:16:19,568 --> 00:16:21,952
I know no man who uses such tools.

234
00:16:21,954 --> 00:16:24,204
But you can find out who does.

235
00:16:24,206 --> 00:16:27,290
First, we will drink
to each other's health,

236
00:16:27,292 --> 00:16:31,128
then I will look into the
identity of this man you seek.

237
00:16:33,214 --> 00:16:34,998
Ahh.

238
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,035
I will also confirm that you
are really Bratva captain.

239
00:16:39,037 --> 00:16:41,037
Should this not be the case,

240
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:43,673
I will send my mechanic here

241
00:16:43,675 --> 00:16:46,543
to find you and kill you and your family.

242
00:16:52,402 --> 00:16:54,603
Carl Rasmussen was found

243
00:16:54,605 --> 00:16:57,122
shot to death in his
home earlier this evening.

244
00:16:57,124 --> 00:16:59,124
The police will not comment
if there's a connection

245
00:16:59,126 --> 00:17:00,576
between Mr. Rasmussen's death

246
00:17:00,578 --> 00:17:02,945
and the murder of James
Holder a few nights ago.

247
00:17:02,947 --> 00:17:06,632
Mr. Rasmussen leaves behind
a wife and three children.

248
00:17:26,437 --> 00:17:27,787
It's a great loss.

249
00:17:27,789 --> 00:17:29,322
Carl was a titan.

250
00:17:29,324 --> 00:17:32,542
A titan who was looking
to buy out a company called

251
00:17:32,544 --> 00:17:33,910
Unidac Industries?

252
00:17:33,912 --> 00:17:36,162
Well, industries are
something of a misnomer.

253
00:17:36,164 --> 00:17:40,467
UI's recent activity was actually
looking into alternative energy.

254
00:17:40,469 --> 00:17:42,168
I think the point my
partner is trying to make

255
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:43,820
is that Carl Rasmussen was

256
00:17:43,822 --> 00:17:45,972
the second bidder this
week to lose his life.

257
00:17:45,974 --> 00:17:48,008
Are you implying something, Detective?

258
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:50,310
Well, only that your husband's
looking into buying Unidac Industries

259
00:17:50,312 --> 00:17:53,063
and the competition seems
to be dropping like flies.

260
00:17:53,065 --> 00:17:55,598
And I'm sure your veiled accusation

261
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,601
has nothing to do with how
you feel about my family?

262
00:18:00,238 --> 00:18:01,488
Unidac's in receivership, Detective.

263
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:03,156
Ownership is subject

264
00:18:03,158 --> 00:18:05,275
to a liquidation auction,
so that means there are

265
00:18:05,277 --> 00:18:07,027
many prospective buyers.

266
00:18:07,029 --> 00:18:09,479
And the auction's tomorrow, so...

267
00:18:09,481 --> 00:18:11,982
if I was taking out the competition,

268
00:18:11,984 --> 00:18:15,018
I have a lot of killing to do
in a very short amount of time.

269
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:18,538
We're just making the rounds
with the interested buyers.

270
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,273
Let them know to be careful.

271
00:18:20,275 --> 00:18:22,425
Oh, yes. And I'm overwhelmed

272
00:18:22,427 --> 00:18:26,129
that Detective Lance is
concerned for our safety.

273
00:18:26,131 --> 00:18:28,381
Well...

274
00:18:28,383 --> 00:18:29,999
Thank you for your concern, gentlemen.

275
00:18:30,001 --> 00:18:33,186
Our security consultant, Mr. Diggle,

276
00:18:33,188 --> 00:18:36,139
is taking all the necessary precautions.

277
00:18:36,141 --> 00:18:37,757
Yeah.

278
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:40,126
Right.

279
00:18:40,128 --> 00:18:42,845
Well, if you need us,

280
00:18:42,847 --> 00:18:46,299
we're just a 911 call away.

281
00:18:52,824 --> 00:18:55,241
Ha ha ha!

282
00:18:55,243 --> 00:18:57,410
Oh, my, this is going to be killer.

283
00:18:57,412 --> 00:19:00,363
If Max never sees me here... I agree.

284
00:19:00,365 --> 00:19:03,166
Ah, if you want to run a business,
you've got to take a few risks.

285
00:19:03,168 --> 00:19:05,001
I don't see your name on the list.

286
00:19:05,003 --> 00:19:06,002
Mr. Queen.

287
00:19:06,004 --> 00:19:07,420
Oh!

288
00:19:10,007 --> 00:19:12,342
I have never seen this
guy before in my life.

289
00:19:12,344 --> 00:19:14,877
Ever.

290
00:19:14,879 --> 00:19:16,846
Oh, come on, he's good.

291
00:19:27,908 --> 00:19:30,893
Oh, wow!

292
00:19:30,895 --> 00:19:34,280
Doesn't you going out and having
fun violate some kind of law,

293
00:19:34,282 --> 00:19:37,033
you know, like the ones that
are carved on a stone tablet?

294
00:19:37,035 --> 00:19:38,618
- That's cute, Tommy.
- Thanks.

295
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:41,237
I can see you two are up to
your old hunting patterns.

296
00:19:41,239 --> 00:19:44,040
Just seeing what passes for fun
in starling city after five years.

297
00:19:44,042 --> 00:19:45,409
Ah.

298
00:19:45,411 --> 00:19:48,511
Well, I'm sure you'll find that it
just hasn't been the same without you.

299
00:19:48,513 --> 00:19:50,630
Big brother!

300
00:19:50,632 --> 00:19:53,299
Oh! I am so wasted right now.

301
00:19:53,301 --> 00:19:56,636
There is... there is two of you.

302
00:19:56,638 --> 00:19:59,272
I thought you were grounded.

303
00:19:59,274 --> 00:20:03,359
I am. And thank you...
thank you for that, by the way.

304
00:20:04,478 --> 00:20:06,563
You're done for the night.

305
00:20:06,565 --> 00:20:08,264
Oh, what are you going to do?

306
00:20:08,266 --> 00:20:11,034
- Tell mom?
- Thea!

307
00:20:11,036 --> 00:20:14,487
You are hanging with
the wrong people.

308
00:20:14,489 --> 00:20:16,573
You're one to talk.

309
00:20:16,575 --> 00:20:20,610
How much do you know about your
own so-called friends over here?

310
00:20:20,612 --> 00:20:23,079
Oh, Thea, maybe you should...

311
00:20:23,081 --> 00:20:26,583
Tommy... I think your
BFF has a right to know.

312
00:20:26,585 --> 00:20:28,051
Thea, let's go.

313
00:20:28,053 --> 00:20:30,036
Well, I guess they never told you

314
00:20:30,038 --> 00:20:33,089
that they've been screwing
while you were gone.

315
00:20:40,981 --> 00:20:42,515
Look, man, I...

316
00:20:42,517 --> 00:20:44,567
Tommy...

317
00:20:44,569 --> 00:20:46,853
It's ok.

318
00:20:49,573 --> 00:20:52,859
You and me, we're done for the night.

319
00:20:52,861 --> 00:20:55,445
Take your hands off of me.

320
00:20:55,447 --> 00:20:58,648
You're not my father.

321
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:01,117
And you're barely my brother.

322
00:21:05,135 --> 00:21:07,019
Well...

323
00:21:07,021 --> 00:21:08,854
look at this.

324
00:21:08,856 --> 00:21:11,273
Oliver Queen.

325
00:21:12,358 --> 00:21:14,476
Max Fuller.

326
00:21:14,478 --> 00:21:16,812
How you been?

327
00:21:16,814 --> 00:21:19,198
Happy you drowned.

328
00:21:21,302 --> 00:21:23,136
Hey, Max...

329
00:21:25,272 --> 00:21:28,358
Get him up!

330
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,609
Hey, let him go, let him go!

331
00:21:29,611 --> 00:21:32,112
Hey, I said let him go!

332
00:21:32,114 --> 00:21:35,181
Told you he was going to be pissed.

333
00:21:35,183 --> 00:21:36,616
Back off, Merlyn.
This isn't your problem.

334
00:21:36,618 --> 00:21:37,901
You want to get to him?

335
00:21:37,903 --> 00:21:40,370
You've got to go through me.

336
00:21:40,372 --> 00:21:42,956
Wow, they are probably
going to get through me.

337
00:21:55,636 --> 00:21:57,754
So is this over, Max?

338
00:21:57,756 --> 00:22:00,473
Or are you going to have
your boys pound on me next?

339
00:22:03,094 --> 00:22:06,396
You three consider
yourselves banned for life.

340
00:22:06,398 --> 00:22:09,432
Get the hell out of my place!

341
00:22:09,434 --> 00:22:12,352
Your club sucks anyway.

342
00:22:12,354 --> 00:22:13,937
You guys ok?

343
00:22:13,939 --> 00:22:16,322
Where'd you learn to do
that? Cop dad, remember?

344
00:22:16,324 --> 00:22:18,858
He made me take self defense classes.

345
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:21,694
Laurel.

346
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:25,281
Thea said...

347
00:22:25,283 --> 00:22:27,667
Oliver, Tommy and I
don't need your blessing.

348
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:32,922
And I don't need your forgiveness.

349
00:22:32,924 --> 00:22:34,758
Ah.

350
00:24:01,153 --> 00:24:03,153
Why don't you guys take a seat,

351
00:24:03,154 --> 00:24:05,405
and I will grab a couple of burgers

352
00:24:05,407 --> 00:24:06,806
and some ice for those faces.

353
00:24:06,808 --> 00:24:08,307
The girl's pretty cute.

354
00:24:08,309 --> 00:24:09,526
That's my sister in law.

355
00:24:09,528 --> 00:24:11,978
Who I will never speak to or... look at.

356
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:14,163
Ever. Gonna grab a booth.

357
00:24:14,165 --> 00:24:16,499
She's not wearing a wedding ring.

358
00:24:16,501 --> 00:24:19,586
Brother out of the picture?

359
00:24:19,588 --> 00:24:22,005
Yeah, you could say that.

360
00:24:26,907 --> 00:24:28,358
Hey you.

361
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,410
So sweet of you to adopt two white boys.

362
00:24:30,412 --> 00:24:31,978
They need a good role model.

363
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:34,280
That's my client Oliver Queen.

364
00:24:35,585 --> 00:24:38,167
Looks like you're doing a
bang up job protecting him.

365
00:24:38,169 --> 00:24:40,503
Mmm.

366
00:24:40,505 --> 00:24:42,071
Look, man...

367
00:24:42,073 --> 00:24:45,158
about Laurel.

368
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,626
I was going to tell you.

369
00:24:46,628 --> 00:24:50,630
I was just trying to
figure out the right way.

370
00:24:50,632 --> 00:24:52,382
To tell somebody that you
slept with their girlfriend

371
00:24:52,384 --> 00:24:56,519
after they went missing
and were then presumed dead.

372
00:24:56,711 --> 00:24:59,812
What, there's no greeting card for that?

373
00:25:01,783 --> 00:25:03,966
Look...

374
00:25:03,968 --> 00:25:05,501
it was wrong.

375
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:07,720
- And I'm sorry...
- Tommy.

376
00:25:09,757 --> 00:25:12,258
I was dead.

377
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,694
No, man, you were with Laurel.

378
00:25:14,696 --> 00:25:17,346
And whether you were
dead, or as it turns out,

379
00:25:17,348 --> 00:25:19,182
alive on a deserted island,

380
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,918
you are my friend.

381
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,537
And me being with Laurel
violated that friendship

382
00:25:24,539 --> 00:25:26,405
in about 50 different ways.

383
00:25:26,407 --> 00:25:28,357
Thank you.

384
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:30,409
But it's ok.

385
00:25:30,411 --> 00:25:33,613
How dangerous is this gig, anyway?

386
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:35,865
It's a cakewalk, Carla, don't worry.

387
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,233
Too late.

388
00:25:37,235 --> 00:25:38,785
Or have you forgotten this job

389
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:42,338
got your brother killed?

390
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,340
Because, Dig, I haven't.

391
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:46,843
I can't.

392
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,348
You are being really chill about this. I...

393
00:25:54,686 --> 00:25:57,603
Hello?

394
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:04,627
It's a Russian model calling me.

395
00:26:04,629 --> 00:26:07,814
Can we... can I have a minute, please?

396
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:11,033
I can see now why you
were able to be so chill.

397
00:26:11,035 --> 00:26:13,686
Enjoy.

398
00:26:13,688 --> 00:26:15,705
So I checked out?

399
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:19,575
You did. His name is Floyd Lawton.

400
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:23,412
I have address. Where he stayed
last time, he was in Starling City.

401
00:26:23,414 --> 00:26:25,064
But that is all.

402
00:26:25,066 --> 00:26:26,299
Let's hope he's a
creature of habit. Go.

403
00:26:26,301 --> 00:26:31,921
1700 Broadway, Papp Motel, room 52.

404
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:34,590
You'll leave us out of this, yes?

405
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:38,144
Assuming Mr. Lawton doesn't kill you first.

406
00:27:52,052 --> 00:27:54,670
Ahem.

407
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:57,306
Felicity Smoke?

408
00:27:57,308 --> 00:27:59,392
Hi. I'm Oliver Queen.

409
00:27:59,394 --> 00:28:01,978
Of course.

410
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,930
I know who you are,
you're Mr. Queen.

411
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,848
No, Mr. Queen was my father.

412
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,034
Right, but he's dead. I mean, he drowned.

413
00:28:08,036 --> 00:28:11,437
But you didn't, which means you
could come down to the I.T. department

414
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:14,223
and listen to me babble.

415
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:16,242
Which will end.

416
00:28:16,244 --> 00:28:19,095
In 3... 2... 1.

417
00:28:19,097 --> 00:28:20,863
I'm having some trouble with my computer

418
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:24,583
and they told me that you were
the person to come and see.

419
00:28:24,585 --> 00:28:27,837
I was at my coffee shop surfing the web

420
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:29,505
and I spilt a latte on it.

421
00:28:29,507 --> 00:28:30,873
- Really?
- Yeah.

422
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,292
'Cause these look like bullet holes.

423
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:35,711
My coffee shop is in a bad neighborhood.

424
00:28:38,131 --> 00:28:41,267
If there is anything that
you can salvage from it,

425
00:28:41,269 --> 00:28:45,104
I would really appreciate it.

426
00:28:45,106 --> 00:28:47,523
Mm-hmm.

427
00:28:55,598 --> 00:28:59,035
Oh. Well, good, you're here.

428
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:01,120
I'm under house arrest, remember.

429
00:29:01,122 --> 00:29:04,373
Do you want to wear the
Calvin Klein or the Zac Posen?

430
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:06,876
For dinner?

431
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:09,445
I was just going to wear pajamas.

432
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:12,048
To Walter's stock auction.

433
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:13,916
I think I rather be grounded.

434
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:15,735
No, it's important that you come.

435
00:29:15,737 --> 00:29:17,336
Important to whom?

436
00:29:18,388 --> 00:29:20,072
To me.

437
00:29:24,578 --> 00:29:28,481
All right, listen to me.

438
00:29:31,601 --> 00:29:33,802
When you were four years old,

439
00:29:33,804 --> 00:29:35,855
you came home one day with a cat.

440
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:39,025
It was a stray, it was filthy,

441
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:40,309
and it was mean.

442
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:42,078
But you stood there and you declared

443
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,863
that it was coming to live with us.

444
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:46,549
Your father came home from the office

445
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:48,317
and he saw what was going on,

446
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:51,170
and he sat you down and he explained to you

447
00:29:51,172 --> 00:29:54,090
that the cat was in fact a tiger

448
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:56,609
and that we needed to get it home.

449
00:29:56,611 --> 00:29:59,295
And somehow...

450
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,997
you understood.

451
00:30:01,999 --> 00:30:05,351
Robert was always so good
at getting through to you.

452
00:30:05,353 --> 00:30:07,937
I... I was always so jealous of that.

453
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:10,773
I...

454
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:17,046
You never talk about him.

455
00:30:17,048 --> 00:30:19,899
Dad.

456
00:30:22,235 --> 00:30:24,954
That's the first time you've
talked about him in years.

457
00:30:26,823 --> 00:30:31,277
Well, I think you and I have
gotten into some bad habits.

458
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:34,196
There's been a lot that
has changed recently, Thea,

459
00:30:34,198 --> 00:30:36,966
and I think that maybe
this can change, too.

460
00:30:52,682 --> 00:30:54,817
It looks like blueprints.

461
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:56,435
Do you know what of?

462
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:59,522
- The exchange building.
- Never heard of it.

463
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:02,491
It's where the Unidac industry's
auction is scheduled to take place.

464
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,112
I thought you said that was your laptop.

465
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,613
Yes.

466
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:09,915
Look, I don't want to get in the middle

467
00:31:09,917 --> 00:31:12,852
of some Shakespearian family drama thing.

468
00:31:12,854 --> 00:31:14,386
What?

469
00:31:14,388 --> 00:31:16,288
Mr. Steele marrying your mom.

470
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:18,674
Claudius, Gertrude...

471
00:31:18,676 --> 00:31:20,742
Hamlet?

472
00:31:20,744 --> 00:31:22,511
I didn't study Shakespeare
at any of the four schools

473
00:31:22,513 --> 00:31:24,746
that I dropped out of.

474
00:31:24,748 --> 00:31:28,050
Mr. Steele is trying to
buy Unidac Industries.

475
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:30,519
And you've got a company laptop

476
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:33,255
associated with one of the
guys he's competing against.

477
00:31:33,257 --> 00:31:36,192
- Floyd Lawton.
- No.

478
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:38,427
Warren Patel.

479
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:41,046
Who's Floyd Lawton?

480
00:31:41,048 --> 00:31:46,235
He is an employee of Mr. Patel, evidently.

481
00:31:48,155 --> 00:31:50,289
The exchange building

482
00:31:50,291 --> 00:31:52,774
is surrounded by 3 towers with
eye lines into the building.

483
00:31:52,776 --> 00:31:54,193
Lawton could get a kill shot off

484
00:31:54,195 --> 00:31:56,629
from virtually anywhere.

485
00:31:56,631 --> 00:32:01,250
But I can't cover the area.

486
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:03,219
I can't protect all of Deadshot's targets.

487
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:06,589
I can't do this alone.

488
00:32:10,884 --> 00:32:14,870
Ah, you son of a bitch! 
Detective, quiet!

489
00:32:14,872 --> 00:32:17,423
You've got a pair on you, pulling
this right outside the police station!

490
00:32:17,425 --> 00:32:18,925
Floyd Lawton's the one targeting the buyers

491
00:32:18,927 --> 00:32:20,509
interested in Unidac Industries.

492
00:32:20,511 --> 00:32:23,813
Interpol calls him "Deadshot"
because he never misses.

493
00:32:23,815 --> 00:32:26,933
You can look this up after I go.

494
00:32:26,935 --> 00:32:29,235
Yeah, and stop chasing you, I suppose?

495
00:32:29,237 --> 00:32:31,404
Warren Patel hired Lawton.

496
00:32:31,406 --> 00:32:33,105
I can't be sure who they're targeting,

497
00:32:33,107 --> 00:32:34,607
it might be all the buyers,

498
00:32:34,609 --> 00:32:37,243
and I can't protect
them in a space that big.

499
00:32:37,245 --> 00:32:39,495
I need your help.

500
00:32:39,497 --> 00:32:40,863
Yeah?

501
00:32:40,865 --> 00:32:42,415
Professional help.

502
00:32:42,417 --> 00:32:45,167
Lawton laces his bullets with curare.

503
00:32:45,169 --> 00:32:47,453
Tell your men to wear kevlar.

504
00:32:47,455 --> 00:32:49,956
I'll them to shoot you...

505
00:33:10,557 --> 00:33:13,976
Well, it's quite a turn out, huh?

506
00:33:13,978 --> 00:33:16,262
Well, it's quite an opportunity, actually.

507
00:33:16,264 --> 00:33:19,682
But regardless of the
outcome of the auction,

508
00:33:19,684 --> 00:33:22,184
I'm already a winner because I
have the two most beautiful women

509
00:33:22,186 --> 00:33:23,402
- at my side tonight.
- Two?

510
00:33:23,404 --> 00:33:25,187
Mm-hmm.

511
00:33:29,659 --> 00:33:32,394
Thanks for coming, Thea.

512
00:33:32,396 --> 00:33:35,164
It means a lot to your mother. And me.

513
00:33:37,951 --> 00:33:39,518
Mr. Steele, the auction

514
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,503
will be opening in 5 minutes.

515
00:33:41,505 --> 00:33:42,872
Please make sure your bid is ready.

516
00:33:42,874 --> 00:33:43,873
- Thank you, Gina.
- Mm-hmm.

517
00:33:43,875 --> 00:33:46,542
- Shall we?
- Mm-hmm.

518
00:33:49,246 --> 00:33:51,764
Warren Patel. I'm going to
need you to come with me, sir.

519
00:33:52,899 --> 00:33:55,885
Unit one, all clear. Unit two, you copy?

520
00:33:55,887 --> 00:33:58,821
We have Patel in custody.
Still, no sign of Lawton.

521
00:33:58,873 --> 00:34:00,023
Unit three?

522
00:34:00,069 --> 00:34:02,186
I'm at the northwest perimeter. All clear.

523
00:34:02,188 --> 00:34:03,354
Unit four?

524
00:34:03,356 --> 00:34:04,855
Parking structure is secure.

525
00:34:04,857 --> 00:34:05,989
Unit five, what's your status?

526
00:34:05,991 --> 00:34:09,159
This is unit five. All clear.

527
00:34:16,573 --> 00:34:19,759
Oh, what a shock.

528
00:34:20,111 --> 00:34:22,945
It is Friday night.

529
00:34:22,947 --> 00:34:24,580
What are you doing here?

530
00:34:24,582 --> 00:34:27,082
Well, I am an attorney
and this is a courthouse,

531
00:34:27,084 --> 00:34:30,920
so I think the better question
is, what are you doing here?

532
00:34:30,922 --> 00:34:33,672
I wanted to talk to you about last night.

533
00:34:33,674 --> 00:34:35,791
You mean how I saved your asses?

534
00:34:35,793 --> 00:34:37,176
You're welcome.

535
00:34:37,178 --> 00:34:39,929
Ok, first of all, we shall never,

536
00:34:39,931 --> 00:34:41,680
ever speak of that ever again.

537
00:34:41,682 --> 00:34:45,317
And secondly, I think you know
that I meant the other thing.

538
00:34:45,319 --> 00:34:47,319
I don't care to talk about that.

539
00:34:47,321 --> 00:34:49,137
I spoke to Oliver.

540
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:53,158
He was surprisingly cool.

541
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:56,829
That's because he knew.

542
00:34:57,964 --> 00:35:00,649
Did you see his face when Thea told him?

543
00:35:00,651 --> 00:35:03,335
Tommy, he didn't even blink.

544
00:35:03,337 --> 00:35:05,421
Trust me, he knew.

545
00:35:05,423 --> 00:35:07,206
Then why didn't he say anything?

546
00:35:07,208 --> 00:35:08,991
I don't know.

547
00:35:08,993 --> 00:35:11,994
Maybe because he knows he doesn't
have any right to judge me.

548
00:35:13,296 --> 00:35:15,965
There's a silver lining, though.

549
00:35:15,967 --> 00:35:17,666
Now that the whole truth

550
00:35:17,668 --> 00:35:19,435
and nothing but is out,

551
00:35:19,437 --> 00:35:22,471
is there a chance now for you and me?

552
00:35:27,343 --> 00:35:29,778
You said you didn't think

553
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:32,531
that I was a one girl type of guy.

554
00:35:32,533 --> 00:35:34,616
I'm going to prove you wrong.

555
00:35:34,618 --> 00:35:37,519
By dating me.

556
00:35:37,521 --> 00:35:38,837
By being better.

557
00:35:38,839 --> 00:35:41,640
By being someone that you deserve

558
00:35:41,642 --> 00:35:43,876
and that you want to be with.

559
00:35:43,878 --> 00:35:46,295
Well...

560
00:35:46,297 --> 00:35:50,566
that's certainly a guy I'd
be interested in meeting.

561
00:35:50,568 --> 00:35:52,685
Good.

562
00:35:52,687 --> 00:35:55,004
Now how about we start, ahem,

563
00:35:55,006 --> 00:35:56,672
by getting you the heck out of here.

564
00:35:56,674 --> 00:35:58,173
Come on, it is Friday night.

565
00:35:58,175 --> 00:35:59,708
Come on.

566
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:01,376
Fine. Good.

567
00:36:05,148 --> 00:36:07,733
Well, don't you scrub up nice?

568
00:36:07,735 --> 00:36:09,217
Here to support my family.

569
00:36:09,219 --> 00:36:11,236
Yeah, me, too, God help me.

570
00:36:11,238 --> 00:36:13,238
Thank you.

571
00:36:18,111 --> 00:36:21,747
Dig. Got your eyes open?

572
00:36:21,749 --> 00:36:23,365
That's what I'm here for, sir.

573
00:36:23,367 --> 00:36:25,084
That and answering patronizing questions.

574
00:36:25,086 --> 00:36:28,236
This guy's out of time.
If he's going to do something,

575
00:36:28,238 --> 00:36:30,039
it's going to happen
before the auction.

576
00:36:30,041 --> 00:36:32,291
Sir?

577
00:36:32,293 --> 00:36:35,577
I heard the story on the radio.

578
00:36:35,579 --> 00:36:37,679
Oliver.

579
00:36:37,681 --> 00:36:39,631
So pleased you were able to attend. Hmm.

580
00:36:39,633 --> 00:36:43,435
Walter, the police said that some
of the Unidac bidders were murdered.

581
00:36:43,437 --> 00:36:45,521
I just think that we should
be a little bit more careful.

582
00:36:45,523 --> 00:36:48,090
My mother's already lost a husband.

583
00:36:48,092 --> 00:36:51,593
Well, if Moira shared your
concern, she wouldn't have come.

584
00:36:51,595 --> 00:36:54,363
And she definitely wouldn't
have brought your sister.

585
00:37:15,792 --> 00:37:17,125
Hi.

586
00:37:17,127 --> 00:37:19,961
Oliver, what a wonderful surprise.

587
00:37:19,963 --> 00:37:22,964
I need you to get them
out of here right now.

588
00:37:37,479 --> 00:37:39,680
Are you ok? Are you hurt?

589
00:37:39,682 --> 00:37:41,533
No, I'm fine! Where is Walter?

590
00:37:41,535 --> 00:37:44,202
Go, go, go, go! Walter's fine.

591
00:37:44,204 --> 00:37:45,853
- Sir, I have to get you out of here.
- No, them!

592
00:37:45,855 --> 00:37:47,688
Them.

593
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:49,624
Go, go, I'll find him,
ma'am, I'll find him.

594
00:39:10,509 --> 00:39:14,462
Drop your guns.

595
00:39:14,464 --> 00:39:17,265
I admire your work.

596
00:39:17,267 --> 00:39:21,001
Guess you won't be extending
me any professional courtesy.

597
00:39:21,003 --> 00:39:23,137
We're not in the same line of work.

598
00:39:23,139 --> 00:39:25,506
Your profession is murder.

599
00:39:25,508 --> 00:39:26,807
You've taken lives.

600
00:39:26,809 --> 00:39:29,477
For the good of others.

601
00:39:29,479 --> 00:39:31,812
You're out for yourself.

602
00:41:50,318 --> 00:41:52,820
Hey.

603
