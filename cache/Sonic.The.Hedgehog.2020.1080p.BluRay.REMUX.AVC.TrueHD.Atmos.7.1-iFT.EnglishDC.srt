1
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:04,546
All right, everyone.

2
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:07,466
This is Jeff Fowler,
director of <i>Sonic the Hedgehog.</i>

3
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:09,051
Hey, my name is Ben Schwartz.

4
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:12,554
I play the voice of Sonic
in <i>Sonic the Hedgehog.</i>

5
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:15,766
And this is the director commentary.

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,937
- And, I guess, the voice-over commentary.
- Two for one.

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,105
- You get us both.
- Thanks for being here.

8
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:25,609
Do you want to take them through
any of this?

9
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:28,737
Yeah. There's not really a better way
to start a <i>Sonic the Hedgehog</i> movie

10
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,447
than a... Wait for it...

11
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:36,411
<i>SEGA.</i>

12
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:38,872
Oh, we, by the way, it's not in the movie,

13
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:44,419
but Jeff and I, for fun,
created a "me saying, 'SEGA, '

14
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:46,505
harmonizing with myself,"
remember that? <i>SEGA.</i>

15
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,048
It was 12 different versions
of your voice.

16
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:49,591
12 different versions of me saying,
"SEGA."

17
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:51,093
It might be in there somewhere buried.

18
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:53,387
- That'd be amazing.
- Deeply, deeply buried.

19
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,930
- Unbelievable.
- Wow.

20
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:56,765
Already gave you a scoop, guys.

21
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,811
And of course, the opening Paramount logo
with the rings

22
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,355
was just another opportunity
to do something really fun,

23
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:04,690
and reference the game.

24
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:07,025
So, we're very happy
we were able to do that,

25
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:11,113
and swap the traditional stars out
for the Sonic rings.

26
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:13,365
<i>Why is that incredibly handsome hedgehog</i>

27
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:16,577
<i>being chased by a madman
with a mustache from the Civil War?</i>

28
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,037
So this felt like a really fun way
you come into the movie,

29
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:21,999
just tease Sonic as we know and love him,

30
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:26,128
kind of dropping right into
a really cool action scene,

31
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,964
but not go too far.

32
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:34,595
By the way, in this movie,
I do more than one Jim Carrey reference.

33
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:37,222
That is the first one, from <i>Ace Ventura,</i>
when he goes,

34
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:39,057
"Let's see that in instant replay..."

35
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:43,270
- Hey, we gotta steal from the best, right?
- And then we did that there.

36
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,439
There's one more.
Let's see if you remember where it is.

37
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:49,568
So, obviously, this is a really,
really exciting opportunity

38
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:53,113
to take the Green Hill Zone from the game

39
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:57,909
and just visualize it in this
really great, really cinematic way.

40
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:01,079
And I just couldn't be happier
with how it came out.

41
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:03,665
It's so lush and beautiful and fun.

42
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:06,126
And look at little Sonic running around.

43
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:11,506
By the way, it should be said, also,
that one of the first drafts of this film

44
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,259
didn't have that action
start at the beginning, right?

45
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:16,887
- You put that in later on.
- That's correct. Yeah.

46
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,765
Just in terms of the structure
of the movie,

47
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:23,602
I think some of the backstory
was kind of the trickiest to solve.

48
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:30,108
Only because...
it is a little heavier in tone,

49
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:33,737
you know, a little darker, just in terms
of these bad guys coming after Sonic

50
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,449
and his guardian, Longclaw,
giving her life to protect him.

51
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:40,035
So, we had it a little bit later
in the movie,

52
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:43,622
and it just felt a little heavy
when we were kind of wanting

53
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:46,500
to get into some of the fun stuff
and the lighter elements.

54
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:50,212
So, once we kind of reworked it
a little bit and put it up front,

55
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:57,094
and made it a little bit more
action-orientated, it felt great.

56
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:02,099
It was just good to get some of these
backstory elements presented up front.

57
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,768
Can I say, Jeff, I've known you
for two or three years now,

58
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,604
this is the most NPR I've ever heard you
in my entire life.

59
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:11,108
You're talking very gently and softly...

60
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,985
It's 90 minutes, I want to be...
But you're right.

61
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:16,947
This is exciting stuff.
I'm gonna sound more...

62
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:20,409
So, are these villains
from the video game at all? No.

63
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:21,827
They're based on the echidnas,

64
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,954
which, of course,
as everyone knows and loves

65
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:27,207
one particular echidna
by the name of Knuckles,

66
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:33,088
but we thought they might make
a good basis for bad guys.

67
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:36,842
So not specifically anyone
from the Sonic Universe

68
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,845
but based off the species of the echidnas.

69
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:43,223
Look how much emotion you bring
right at the beginning of the movie.

70
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:46,893
Yeah. Yeah, I know we want to get off
in an exciting and dramatic way.

71
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:48,937
- Origin story.
- Yeah, baby.

72
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,690
Yeah, baby. Hard cut to...

73
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,278
And here we are. Green Hills, Montana.

74
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,321
And just this scene that we really loved,

75
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:02,701
which is so simple
but just felt right for Sonic,

76
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,828
which is the idea of a speed trap,

77
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:08,290
and a small-town sheriff,
and Sonic just having a little fun,

78
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:11,084
going back and forth
and seeing how fast he could go.

79
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,381
<i>I'm bored.</i>

80
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:18,008
<i>Tom, do you readme? Are you there?</i>

81
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,845
<i>No, Wade,
I'm actually on a yacht in Barbados.</i>

82
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:23,555
<i>With Rihanna.</i>

83
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:25,682
<i>O-M-G.</i>

84
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:26,767
That's Adam Pally.

85
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:30,103
I was in a sketch and improv group
with Adam Pally and a guy named Gil Ozeri

86
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:31,271
called Hot Sauce.

87
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:34,399
That's how I started my career out
at Upright Citizens Brigade in New York.

88
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:36,985
So the idea that I get to be in a movie
with Adam here

89
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,445
makes me very pleased.

90
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,489
Also, it should be known
that James Marsden is

91
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:43,492
one of the most attractive human beings
I've seen in my entire life.

92
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:44,701
And also incredibly funny.

93
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,620
This was actually
his first day of shooting.

94
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:49,706
We had him just on the side of the highway
in this cop car

95
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,959
and just asked him
to do all these jokes and gags

96
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:56,213
on just being bored out of his mind.
And he gave us so much great stuff.

97
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:59,466
And of course,
we couldn't include all of it.

98
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:02,636
But it was just
such a great start to the shoot,

99
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:06,348
and really, kind of, I think, showed
how much fun he was gonna have

100
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,183
- with the character...
- What day number was this?

101
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,268
This was actually day one.

102
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:13,772
- Really?
- Sheriff Tom in the car,

103
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,941
being bored, and all these little...

104
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:19,069
Yeah, him getting out
and then finding the quill, this is all...

105
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:22,155
What's the very first shot you shot?
What's the very last shot you shot?

106
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:28,411
I think the first shot was actually
that wide, the crane shot,

107
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:32,707
the establish of this highway
and then it booming down,

108
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:33,834
and then...

109
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:37,462
The last shot?
I'll have to give that some thought.

110
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:39,422
It would have been
the mushroom planet stuff.

111
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,633
- Oh, yeah, with Jim at the end.
- Yeah. Yeah.

112
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:45,428
<i>Just kidding. A duck stole a bagel.</i>

113
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:49,432
Did Pally improvise that?
"A duck stole a bagel"? It's great.

114
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:54,145
No, but I certainly think he could have.
He's an incredibly funny individual.

115
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:56,314
So this little turtle beat,

116
00:05:56,398 --> 00:06:00,944
and this is obviously
our first introduction to Sonic...

117
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:05,615
in Green Hills, sort of, of age,

118
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:09,870
and we came up with this little
turtle gag, which we loved,

119
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:14,082
and really spoke to Sonic's personality
of being very fun-loving,

120
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:17,669
and trying to do this little guy a favor
and give him the ride of his life.

121
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,672
- I haven't seen this yet.
- Yeah.

122
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:26,386
When I do voice-over,
often times it's rough versions of it,

123
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,805
or animatics or something like that.

124
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:31,892
Yeah, and it's me promising you
that it'll be funny when we do it,

125
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:33,310
because it's usually...

126
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,769
especially in the early days,

127
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:37,147
it takes a little while
to get everything dialed in.

128
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,732
And that turtle thing, you added that.

129
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,901
There was a tiny little piece,
and then you...

130
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:42,903
- Yes. Yeah. Well...
- You kept making that bigger.

131
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:44,821
Building and building that beat up
more and more.

132
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:45,906
Yeah.

133
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:47,991
So this is obviously really fun,

134
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:52,913
kind of creating this little cave,
this little kid's bedroom for Sonic,

135
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:55,999
and show how he's been living
all these years

136
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:59,794
since he got to Earth,
and sort of accumulating all this stuff,

137
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:03,757
and just having his little routine

138
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,302
and all his imaginative little ways
of entertaining himself.

139
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,596
That was an Easter egg, right?
The bandana was an Easter egg.

140
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,181
- Yep.
- You should point them all out.

141
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,807
- Here's another one.
- Hill Top Road.

142
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:15,226
That's Hill Top Zone from <i>Sonic 2.</i>

143
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:18,730
Of course, rings,
about as Sonic as it gets.

144
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,983
<i>And if I'm ever discovered,
I'll follow Longclaw's instructions...</i>

145
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:25,070
May or may not be some fun little
Easter eggs on this map right here.

146
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,738
Let's see if you can find them all.

147
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:30,200
There's a SEGA Saturn logo
in there somewhere.

148
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:35,914
This is the part, in terms of voice-over,
we must have done 20 or something...

149
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,916
20 or something recordings, maybe more.

150
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:42,545
But this beginning part,
explaining all this stuff,

151
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:45,423
- was the thing we did more than anything.
- I think you're right.

152
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:47,384
And it was pages of dialogue,
and we did it...

153
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,761
We must have done
seven or eight versions of it.

154
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:54,516
Yeah. Well, you're always trying to find
the funniest way to present it,

155
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,644
and obviously time is always a factor

156
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:01,940
and really wanting it just to be
really pithy and fun

157
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,525
and so, yeah, we definitely...

158
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,902
And the other thing, too,
is when you're working in animation,

159
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,405
you do have the opportunity
to rework stuff a little bit

160
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,366
versus live action,
when you shoot what you shoot,

161
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:14,285
but in the animation world,
things are little more malleable.

162
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:17,622
You can kind of
continue to tweak and to plus.

163
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:20,333
- I would say one of...
- Sanic.

164
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:22,168
- Oh, that's a great reference.
- There's a Sanic. Yep.

165
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:25,547
And that guy on the left, Scott,
that was just laughing as the bar patron,

166
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,550
was a gentleman
who doubled as Sonic in Vancouver.

167
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,052
- Correct. Very funny individual.
- Really nice guy.

168
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:33,138
Yeah. Really great to have his help.

169
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:37,600
I chatted with him before we did it,
kind of, like, explaining...

170
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,395
going through the script
and stuff like that.

171
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,897
And then I'm sure he played around, too,
when he was over there.

172
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:44,983
- He's, I heard, a great improviser.
- Yeah.

173
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,484
No, he was fantastic.

174
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:50,405
So, that little piece
of the Crazy Carl stuff,

175
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:54,701
just going back to some scenes
that, originally, were longer,

176
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:57,203
or were we kind of repurposed...

177
00:08:57,287 --> 00:09:02,292
and that's another thing you can see
in the additional materials

178
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,044
was a really great scene that I loved.

179
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:09,132
It was this kind of fun,
sort of nighttime in the forest,

180
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,551
a truck drives out, sets a bunch of traps,

181
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:16,222
you realize this guy
has a plan for catching Sonic,

182
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:17,724
but Sonic is just too fast,

183
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,976
and he's just playing
all these gags on him.

184
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:23,438
But ultimately, as we were reworking
the beginning of this film,

185
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,857
it just didn't quite work as well.

186
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,985
It felt like we needed
to just get to Sonic a little sooner

187
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,154
because that was all very teasing.

188
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,822
It was more about...

189
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:34,908
meeting the townspeople
before we met Sonic.

190
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:38,995
So after a little bit of reworking,

191
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:44,709
we ended up with a really cool
San Francisco opening shot and sequence.

192
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:46,461
Do you listen to a lot
of director's commentary, Jeff?

193
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:47,754
Yeah, I think they're great.

194
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:51,216
I especially remember, when I was
in art school and working on projects,

195
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,885
I would just put a movie on
and put a director commentary on,

196
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,762
and I just really loved all the stories

197
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,430
- and the little details.
- And fall asleep to it.

198
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,684
There was no sleep in art school.
It was...

199
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:03,853
It was a lot of all-nighters.

200
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:06,272
-Tika Sumpter
-Yes.

201
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:10,485
We were very lucky with our whole cast.
Everyone was so funny, so charming.

202
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:14,739
And we had just such a great time
shooting the movie.

203
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:16,950
- We shot it in Vancouver.
- Correct.

204
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:19,536
- Lovely place to make a movie.
- Yeah.

205
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,995
- Great food.
- Very talented crew.

206
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:23,456
<i>"We have reviewed your application
to the San Francisco Police Department,</i>

207
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,209
<i>and pending interdepartmental review
and background check,</i>

208
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:29,671
<i>we are happy to inform you that you have
been selected to join our team."</i>

209
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,172
<i>- Oh, my God!
- Wow.</i>

210
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,174
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

211
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:38,680
Had a lot of fun designing these cakes,
the good news and the bad news versions.

212
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:41,891
You should talk about your background
a little bit. Talk about...

213
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:44,602
For people who may not have
researched you a little bit,

214
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:47,939
because I think your background helped
so much in this particular project,

215
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:50,942
and obviously this is a huge opportunity
to direct this type of movie, the scope,

216
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:54,445
but I feel like all the stuff that you had
in animation and directing in the past

217
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:55,697
really culminated in this.

218
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,991
So where did you come from?
Where did you come from?

219
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,243
Blur Studio, in Culver City, California.

220
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:03,288
Spent 15 years there,
working in visual effects and animation.

221
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,415
Was hired right out of school
by Tim Miller,

222
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:08,334
who directed <i>Deadpool,</i>
and he's one of the producers on <i>Sonic.</i>

223
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:12,005
And, yeah, he just really created
an amazing atmosphere

224
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:16,634
for artists and animators
and I just really enjoyed working there.

225
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:18,428
And one of the first things I worked on

226
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,181
was actually <i>Shadow the Hedgehog</i>
video game cinematics,

227
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:23,850
and that created
a really great relationship with SEGA,

228
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,894
and we just kept in touch ever since,

229
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:28,313
and so the opportunity
for <i>Sonic</i> came along,

230
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:31,191
and Tim was very instrumental
in vouching for me,

231
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:33,818
and saying, "Hey, I think this guy
would do a great job."

232
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:39,115
And so I was very fortunate
to have that opportunity,

233
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,910
and... could not have had
a better experience making the movie.

234
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:43,077
It's amazing.

235
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:47,457
Worked out well
'cause we got along great, and...

236
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,211
we're excited that we had
the opportunity to make this movie.

237
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:54,631
But even before that,
you directed an animated short.

238
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:58,176
- Correct. Yes. Thank you.
- I'm trying to help you out, man.

239
00:11:58,593 --> 00:11:59,802
- God.
- Well.

240
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:02,972
There was a short,
and it was called <i>Gopher Broke.</i>

241
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,849
<i>-Gopher Broke</i>
-That's right. And I was...

242
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:07,644
I was fortunate enough
to make it at Blur when I was there.

243
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,938
That's probably
my first directing opportunity

244
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:13,942
and it actually went on to get nominated
for an Academy Award that year.

245
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:17,111
Can you do... Most of your stuff
is in graphic animation, correct?

246
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:18,863
Most of the stuff is through computers?

247
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:20,990
Can you do longhand? Can you do...

248
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,825
- You mean like 2D vs. 3D?
- Yes.

249
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:25,662
In terms of... 'Cause the stuff
I've seen you do is mostly 3D.

250
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:29,374
I definitely have
a traditional sort of art background.

251
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,834
I mean, 3D animation didn't really exist

252
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:33,711
when I was in middle school
and high school.

253
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:36,297
So, it was all hand-drawn stuff
and drawing.

254
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:40,635
But then as soon as movies like
<i>Jurassic Park</i> and <i>Toy Story</i> came along,

255
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:44,097
I was just completely hooked
by visual effects

256
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,807
and what it can do for storytelling.

257
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:51,479
Yeah, then I just wanted to find a place
where I could study that,

258
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,856
and that was
the Ringling School of Art and Design

259
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,733
in Sarasota, Florida.

260
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:57,193
It was a great place to...

261
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:00,446
Right next
to the Ringling Brothers Circus, right?

262
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:03,408
- It is. Yes, they are related.
- Oh, I was doing a bit. Is that real?

263
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,034
Yeah. No, it is. It is.

264
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,619
Whose kid... Isn't this somebody's kid?

265
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:07,996
This is my nephew.

266
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,455
- That's your nephew.
- Yes.

267
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:13,251
That was... a very blatant use
of directing power, to cast him.

268
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,420
- He did an amazing job.
- He did an incredible job.

269
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,547
Yeah, he did a wonderful job.

270
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:22,510
Now, this is one of my favorite scenes
in the whole movie,

271
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,012
especially when Sonic comes out.

272
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:27,598
And it just really spoke to what I wanted
from the movie,

273
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:32,270
which is this kid
who's kind of living by himself,

274
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:34,188
but he's got
this really great imagination,

275
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:35,565
and he's got this super speed,

276
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,109
and what would it be like
to have super speed,

277
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:41,863
and the wish fulfillment aspect
of playing baseball,

278
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:45,116
and being so fast
that you can play all the positions.

279
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,909
I just thought it was so fun,

280
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:51,205
and really just gave this movie, <i>Sonic,</i>

281
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:53,249
just a personality and a charm.

282
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:55,626
That was really great.

283
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,129
It's also such a kids' thing,

284
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:00,340
- to pretend you're every single person.
- Absolutely.

285
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:01,716
It's such a fun little kid...

286
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:05,136
Anytime I played Sonic, the whole thing
was, obviously he can run really fast,

287
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:07,638
and he has all this energy,
but the idea is that he's a kid.

288
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:10,725
He's a really excited kid that never
really gets to get out of his cave,

289
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:13,061
so when he gets to get out,
he's even more excited.

290
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:14,604
And all the energy you see in his running

291
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,357
is used in the positive stuff
he does in his real life.

292
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,609
Yeah. We had fun
writing all these little pieces.

293
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,652
This is one of the first things
you finalized.

294
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:24,030
I remember watching this
before a lot of the other stuff.

295
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:27,825
Yeah. I think there's probably two
or three scenes in the entire movie

296
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:31,120
that we designed very early on
and just said, "This is it.

297
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:34,916
This is our Sonic. This is our tone.

298
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,125
This is our world."

299
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,669
And this baseball scene
was definitely one of them.

300
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:43,341
It just kind of... yeah.

301
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,886
I haven't seen final versions
of a lot of this, so this is exciting.

302
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,012
Yeah.

303
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:53,059
Also, the music already nods
to the original video games.

304
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,937
Yeah, Tom Holkenborg aka Junkie XL.

305
00:14:56,479 --> 00:15:00,274
We were so lucky to get him
and to have his help on the score.

306
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:04,195
And he did such an amazing job.
I just love all the music in this movie.

307
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:10,868
And then...
So, yeah, like the other side of this,

308
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:14,122
I mean, all the fun we were having
with Sonic playing all the parts,

309
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:17,750
but then for it to end very emotionally

310
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:20,878
and really have you feel
for this character

311
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:24,549
and really understand how hard it is

312
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:27,885
that despite his super speed
and all his creativity and imagination,

313
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:31,139
at the end of the day, it's not
a replacement for having real connection,

314
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:33,266
and that is what the movie is about,

315
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:38,521
is Sonic needing to find that community,
find a friend, find a family,

316
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,358
which we just thought grounded it
in some really relatable stuff.

317
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:46,070
And also, it forced me to cry
in the voice-over booth,

318
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:49,240
which is the reason why you said,
anytime I cried, it made you happy.

319
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:52,076
Or we're going in the right direction
for sure.

320
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,370
- There's Pally.
- Yeah, he's great.

321
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:59,208
That town's in trouble
if that's their police force.

322
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,002
Cell tower seems to be working though.

323
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,172
<i>What is going on?</i>

324
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:06,174
<i>Well, gosh, I think the power's out.</i>

325
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:07,717
<i>Yeah, no dur! The lights are out.</i>

326
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,594
What was the process of getting Marsden?

327
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:13,014
Did you have a bunch of meetings
with him before and you talked?

328
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:16,142
See, I... This is exciting for me,
because I was not there.

329
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,644
I was in Vancouver
maybe for three or four days.

330
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:19,979
What was great about James is,

331
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:23,566
he had had plenty of experience
with this type of thing.

332
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,986
I mean, it's not an easy thing
to ask of an actor, I think,

333
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,738
to put them next to a tennis ball

334
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:34,535
or basically a character that's not there
and to get the right performance,

335
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:36,370
especially a comedy performance.

336
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:38,831
And James had done the work before

337
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:43,628
and just knew how to do it,
and just absolutely crushed it.

338
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,254
'Cause this is not easy,

339
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:49,383
to share a scene with someone
who is not physically there.

340
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:53,137
He's a great actor, man.
By the way, what you said before,

341
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:55,640
- he is so funny.
- Yes.

342
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:58,559
He is so funny and he's so humble
about how funny he is

343
00:16:58,643 --> 00:17:00,353
that he never admits that he's funny.

344
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:02,730
He's great.

345
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:04,357
Yeah. I mean, everyone.

346
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,609
What I loved about this cast
more than anything was

347
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:10,029
everyone was so funny
and always had pitches and ideas

348
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:12,240
and just made everything better,

349
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:14,617
which is really, I think...

350
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:19,330
the best version of movie making
is to allow for everyone

351
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:21,707
to, sort of, pitch ideas.

352
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,585
And of course they might not all
make it into the movie,

353
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:26,128
but I love hearing them,

354
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:31,050
and a lot of the stuff wouldn't have been
as good as it was

355
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:35,763
without all these ideas
from the cast, from the crew.

356
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,518
Now we're about
to get introduced to Robotnik.

357
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,186
What was the process
of getting Jim Carrey?

358
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:46,607
I just sat down with him
and had a really great discussion,

359
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:51,779
and I'm obviously a huge fan
of everything he's ever done,

360
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:57,577
but certainly,
kind of, grew up with all the classics.

361
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:00,496
<i>Ace Ventura</i> and <i>The Mask</i>
and <i>Dumb and Dumber,</i>

362
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:05,167
and we were so fortunate
that he was excited and interested,

363
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,420
and he just brought so much
to this character,

364
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,255
'cause, I mean, it was really funny...

365
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:10,798
on paper and in the script,

366
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:12,300
but Jim just made it his own.

367
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:14,093
He's so funny in this movie.

368
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:15,720
Yeah, it's so original.

369
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:18,556
And it hits a part of your bones
that the movie is...

370
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,850
Of course, he's incredible
in everything and has been,

371
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:24,186
but it harkens back to some of that stuff
that you remember as a kid

372
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,105
and his performances, and you're like,

373
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,149
"He could just move his finger
and he's funny."

374
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,942
- Absolutely.
- He's just a funny human.

375
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:32,695
- Yes, he just can't help it.
- He is.

376
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,364
I am a huge fan of his.

377
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:36,616
We used to...

378
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:38,409
I mean, <i>Dumb and Dumber</i> and <i>Ace Ventura,</i>

379
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:41,203
those were things that we watched
as if they were scripture.

380
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:42,413
Right, right.

381
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:44,540
Sacred.

382
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:52,048
So, yeah, really fun
designing this introductory scene,

383
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,925
this giant truck pulling onto
the baseball field.

384
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:58,012
I remember having
some discussions and concern

385
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:00,598
that we were gonna drive this big truck
into the outfield

386
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,683
and it was just
basically gonna get stuck there

387
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:06,979
and we wouldn't be able to do another take
but fortunately it worked out

388
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:08,147
and we were able to...

389
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:10,316
Fake mustache, right?

390
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:13,653
- I'll never tell.
- Wow.

391
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,947
- Yes, yes. Yes, yes.
- It has to be. Look at it.

392
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:19,241
It's amazing.

393
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:23,621
Yeah. We had so much fun
designing this character.

394
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:26,624
I mean, obviously, we wanted to be
respectful of the source material,

395
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:31,921
and Dr. Robotnik looks very different
in the games,

396
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,757
but this being an origin story,

397
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:41,305
I also wanted to back into
that look of Robotnik

398
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:44,141
and please start him
as the government guy,

399
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:48,688
and ground him a little bit
in terms of introducing him as a character

400
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:52,066
and then build on that
and then grow it into the character

401
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:54,568
that the fans...

402
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:57,113
- might be familiarized.
- You're right.

403
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:01,492
It is basically an origin story
for both Sonic and Robotnik.

404
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,912
Yeah. I mean, that was really this being...

405
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:09,709
going back to the inspiration
and the 1991 game,

406
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:13,879
and just keeping it very simple,
keeping it Sonic versus Robotnik,

407
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:18,050
and just really telling
a really great story for each of them,

408
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:21,512
and giving Sonic
a really great character arc,

409
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:25,766
which is why we felt we needed
to introduce him

410
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:28,018
as a younger hedgehog
running around his island

411
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:29,770
and then set him up on Earth,

412
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:32,022
and watch him go through
some growth and development

413
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:33,357
as he goes on his adventure.

414
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:37,653
Also, all these little things,
nods to all the electronic building

415
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:40,072
and tinkering that he does
in the video games, right?

416
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:42,283
All these little egg pods
and stuff like that.

417
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,534
We definitely...

418
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,996
There being the great debate,
whether it's Dr. Robotnik or "Eggman"

419
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:50,040
depending on which part of the world
you're asking the question in.

420
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,754
But his drones,
these little flying egg things,

421
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:57,965
we thought it would be fun
for that to inform

422
00:20:58,048 --> 00:20:59,967
why does Sonic call him "Eggman,"

423
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:03,888
and it's because Sonic,
sort of, meets him through

424
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:06,640
these little flying drones
that are egg-shaped, and so,

425
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:09,101
Sonic refers to him as Eggman,

426
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:14,231
just like Sonic refers to
the Sheriff Wachowski character

427
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:15,441
- as Donut Lord.
- Donut Lord.

428
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,526
He just has these fun little nicknames
for everybody

429
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,945
and Tika's character is Pretzel Lady.

430
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:24,492
So, it was a fun idea for Sonic
to have developed his own

431
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:27,870
description for people,
just based on not knowing any better

432
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,206
because he's living
as this outsider looking in.

433
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,291
What was it like for you
as a first-time director

434
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:35,753
to direct a legend
right out of the gate?

435
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,297
And also, someone that you've seen
be the lead

436
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,925
of $150 million movies.

437
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:44,303
So, what's your... What was that like?

438
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,388
'Cause, for me, I would be, of course,

439
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:47,807
if I was directing
someone like Jim Carrey,

440
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,809
I'd be nervous right off the bat,

441
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:53,229
but I guess you just don't have time,
so what was that like?

442
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:56,982
Just having enough conversations
before we were there on the day, shooting,

443
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:58,734
and just trading ideas,

444
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:02,112
and certainly, you get to do that
when you're blocking a scene,

445
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:05,866
and you're talking about ways to do it
and to make it funny,

446
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:08,327
and so, yeah,
you just kind of work through it.

447
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:11,497
It's a sharing of ideas,
and it's a collaboration,

448
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,082
and I think that certainly is a way

449
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,251
of getting everybody comfortable
with each other

450
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,127
before the cameras are rolling.

451
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:19,088
So having enough,
I guess that's the trick,

452
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,172
is just having enough time...

453
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:22,216
to discuss, share ideas

454
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:26,345
leading into the actual shoot
that you feel comfortable with each other

455
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:30,224
and, yeah, you can just have some fun
and have the atmosphere be light,

456
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:32,101
and hopefully get some great stuff.

457
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:36,397
<i>...lightning shot out of your butt,
and now they're coming for you.</i>

458
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,525
We did so many versions of that.
I don't know which one you used.

459
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:44,071
I love this little shot, this little
manic collection of all his items...

460
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:46,824
<i>Okay, toothbrush, toothpaste,
hair gel, night-light.</i>

461
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:47,741
<i>Funny hat.</i>

462
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:48,826
Yeah, the funny hat.

463
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,619
I mean, one thing
we learned very quickly on

464
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:53,873
was giving Sonic props and outfit changes

465
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:55,291
was just a big win.

466
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:58,752
I mean, it was so fun to dress him up
in all these little outfits,

467
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:03,382
or give him all these little props
that we just couldn't enough of it.

468
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:06,260
So, anytime there was an opportunity
to do it, we jumped on it.

469
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:08,262
That hat alludes to a callback

470
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,472
when we were wearing
a cowboy hat in the cowboy bar.

471
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,766
- Who knew?
- It's true. You're right.

472
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,186
- Make him cry.
- Yeah.

473
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:21,108
<i>- Hey.
- Hey.</i>

474
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,192
<i>Whatcha doing?</i>

475
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:24,778
<i>Just coloring with Jojo and Rachel.</i>

476
00:23:24,862 --> 00:23:26,947
<i>Ah, that sounds half fun.</i>

477
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:29,199
<i>Hey, exciting stuff here.
We had a power outage.</i>

478
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:31,160
<i>The whole town went dark.</i>

479
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,579
<i>It was like a sign telling me
to get out of Dodge.</i>

480
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:36,123
By the way,
the reason that I got the role,

481
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:37,708
or I don't know,
you must know more than I do,

482
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:40,252
but I had a meeting with Tim Miller
about a different project,

483
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:42,171
and while I was there,
Jeff was literally sitting...

484
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,672
- I sit next to Tim Miller.
- Yep.

485
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:44,757
It was destiny.

486
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,967
- It was right there.
- He saw I had Sonic stuff on my desk

487
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:49,553
- you were, like, "I love <i>Sonic."</i>
- I'm like, "Hey. Let's talk."

488
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:51,805
And then Tim goes,
"Yeah. You should talk to Jeff,

489
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:54,016
'cause you might be perfect for..."
I was, like, "Oh, yeah."

490
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,185
Then you called me and you were, like,
"Hey, it would be a dream

491
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,895
if you could do this," and I was, like,

492
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:00,814
"You know what? Let's do it.
I'm excited about the opportunity."

493
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:06,195
Yeah. No, it was fun.
You can just tell that you got it,

494
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,948
you got the character, and you brought
some new stuff to it

495
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:11,742
'cause, I mean, I love...

496
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:15,329
Many actors have played Sonic
over the years,

497
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:20,000
but I really loved, obviously,
the humor that you brought to it.

498
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:23,003
I think, in the movie,
you really just give him a...

499
00:24:23,087 --> 00:24:24,922
There's the vulnerability,
there's charm,

500
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:28,509
there's an earnestness, optimism.

501
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:31,929
It really just, for me,
it was a perfect fit.

502
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:34,765
So we were very lucky
to find you so early on,

503
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:40,688
and, yeah, I love where we landed
with movie <i>Sonic.</i>

504
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:42,690
<i>You have to do it.
There's no other option.</i>

505
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:45,776
<i>All right.</i>

506
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:49,738
<i>SFPD, pending background check.</i>

507
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:51,323
<i>Paws in the air!</i>

508
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:55,703
<i>Uh, meow?</i>

509
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:58,956
A meow.

510
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:01,667
Now a meme, a "meow."

511
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,294
For me, it was always
try to keep a part of the process,

512
00:25:04,378 --> 00:25:06,046
'cause I loved this so much.

513
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,965
And then, I remember getting a phone call.

514
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:10,592
I had just finished doing a podcast
and I was walking out,

515
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:13,178
and I didn't know if I was gonna be
this role or not

516
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:16,974
because obviously, there's protocol
and stuff like that people do,

517
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:19,727
and then you called me personally
to tell me that I got the role.

518
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:22,813
That was such a big, exciting moment
for me when you called.

519
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:23,981
That's great, man.

520
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:27,818
As you alluded to before, I mean,
the trick with these animated characters

521
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:31,655
is you just record a lot of material
and you rewrite stuff,

522
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:35,200
and you rewrite it, and you rewrite it,
and you're always game for it,

523
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:38,829
always ad-libbing, giving us variations
and options on stuff.

524
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:41,415
And that was... That's really...

525
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:46,920
There's no secret.
It's really just working the ideas

526
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:50,799
and just going as far as you can
to get to the good stuff.

527
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:52,968
I'll talk a little bit
about the process of that,

528
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:55,721
but stop me if there's something you want
to talk about on the screen, Jeff,

529
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,806
'cause you know way more
about this stuff than I do.

530
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:00,851
- No, go for it.
- Okay.

531
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:03,562
So the process for when
we get to really recording,

532
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:06,940
obviously we do table reads
and you play with the words then,

533
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:09,651
but what Jeff alluded to
was very much true,

534
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:14,114
where because Sonic is CG and animated,

535
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:16,909
Jeff can't re-shoot all these scenes.
It would be impossible,

536
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:18,118
it would cost too much money,

537
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:20,245
but it was just sketches
of what Sonic would be doing

538
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:22,706
so we could change what Sonic said
as much as we wanted,

539
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,833
and we did quite a bit.
So we'd do the script,

540
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:27,336
then Jeff and I would
think of different things to say,

541
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:30,047
and then Jeff would give me
a leash to go improvise,

542
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:33,217
because we're there, it doesn't cost money
for me to make up stuff.

543
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,677
Then Jeff, as director,
would figure out what felt best,

544
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:36,804
and he would kind of...

545
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:38,889
There'd be moments where in the script,
we'd be, like, "You know what?

546
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,557
This feels like
it needs something like this."

547
00:26:40,641 --> 00:26:42,684
And we'd take a second, rework the words,

548
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:44,937
and it was incredibly collaborative,

549
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:48,148
which was so exciting for me, especially
coming from an improv background

550
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:52,361
so to have Jeff and Toby Ascher
in that room was very exciting.

551
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:56,698
But to me that was so cool
that you were open enough to be like,

552
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:58,867
"Let's try a bunch of stuff here,
let's do this."

553
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:00,661
And we would rework words
and rewrite stuff

554
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:02,871
and we would improvise, and then, in post,

555
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:05,707
we'd find out what worked the best,
and once you find that track,

556
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:07,751
we'd then follow that track.

557
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:11,547
Is that a pretty accurate way
of describing what our process was?

558
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,590
- It is.
- There's a lot of playing around

559
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:16,301
and a lot of reworking
and stuff like that.

560
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:19,221
But it starts with a great script
and knowing Jeff with the characters,

561
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,514
and us all agreeing on that.

562
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:23,767
Yeah. And we had some very, very funny,
very talented writers on this.

563
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:25,269
- Yes.
- Josh Miller and Pat Casey

564
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:28,063
are wonderful, wonderful people,

565
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:31,358
and really just enjoyed the collaboration
every step of the way.

566
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:32,901
- So funny.
- And worked really hard.

567
00:27:33,861 --> 00:27:38,574
Every time I was like, "Hey, can we
push... workshop this idea a little bit?"

568
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:43,745
And they would always have four or five,
six, seven line pitches

569
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:44,830
with alts,

570
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:48,292
and just constantly giving us
stuff to try, which was great.

571
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:49,543
They were great.

572
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:51,670
<i>Practically finishing
each other's sentences.</i>

573
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:54,715
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

574
00:27:58,135 --> 00:27:59,428
<i>Hello there!</i>

575
00:28:00,304 --> 00:28:01,430
<i>Can I help you?</i>

576
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,685
<i>Good morning, my rural chum.</i>

577
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:10,647
This is a great little scene
with James and Jim

578
00:28:10,731 --> 00:28:13,358
I know...
that James was very excited about.

579
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:15,110
Was this their first scene together?

580
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:17,571
I believe so.

581
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:19,323
That's crazy, 'cause it's a great one.

582
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:21,658
Yeah. Yeah, this is fantastic.

583
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,368
<i>He's a good man.</i>

584
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:26,914
<i>- Yeah. Come on in!
- Great.</i>

585
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:28,373
<i>Take all the readings you need.</i>

586
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:30,209
<i>Except,</i>

587
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:33,337
<i>doesn't the power company usually take
their readings from outside the house?</i>

588
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,464
<i>That way they can check them
even if you're not home.</i>

589
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:38,550
<i>Also my buddy Spencer
works for the gas company,</i>

590
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:40,219
<i>and he's more of an Ultimate Frisbee guy.</i>

591
00:28:40,302 --> 00:28:42,930
<i>So, you want to tell me
why you think I'm dumb enough</i>

592
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:44,556
<i>to just let you walk inside my house?</i>

593
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:50,270
Who came up with that idea?
The stuff on his glove?

594
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:53,315
It almost looks like
a reverse Power Glove.

595
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,317
That'd be the wrong reference though.

596
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,610
It's the wrong...

597
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:00,489
But who came up with that?
And how did that start?

598
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:05,911
I think that might have been a discussion
I had with my production designer, Sean,

599
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,079
Sean Haworth.

600
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:10,249
We were always trying
to look for little ways to...

601
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:12,084
Actually, no.
Now that I'm thinking about it,

602
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:16,630
I remember Jim, in particular,
talking about the glove

603
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:22,094
and wanting that texting,
kind of finger movement,

604
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:23,971
sort of, worked into it somehow.

605
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:25,681
So I think we had the idea
for the wrist pad,

606
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,557
and then Jim came up with the idea

607
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:31,436
of adding the little buttons
on the palm of the glove

608
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,438
so he could do
the little interactive stuff.

609
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:35,857
- That's great.
- Yeah, it was a wonderful little detail.

610
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:37,651
<i>But my dentist calls me Rob.</i>

611
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:40,320
So good.

612
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:42,197
- This is a great scene.
- Yeah.

613
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:45,075
<i>I'm sure what you're here for
is very serious,</i>

614
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:46,535
<i>but it's got nothing to do with me.</i>

615
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:47,911
<i>You can ask anyone in town.</i>

616
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:49,955
<i>- Everyone knows me.
- I bet they do.</i>

617
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:53,292
<i>I'm sure you're hella popular
with the Jebs and Merles and Billy Bobs</i>

618
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:55,961
<i>in this glorified gas-station rest stop.</i>

619
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:58,255
<i>Betcha go way back
to the days of tippin' cows</i>

620
00:29:58,338 --> 00:29:59,923
<i>and playin' in a jug band!</i>

621
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,510
- That's so great.
- Give me a break.

622
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:08,307
Yeah, you can really see them there,
on the palms of the hands,

623
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:09,725
the pad, the little interface

624
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:12,602
- on the glove. Yeah.
- Yeah, even on the tips of the fingers.

625
00:30:12,686 --> 00:30:14,855
And that was really fun to design.

626
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:20,610
I mean, Jim Carrey was involved
even with the costume design

627
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:23,238
and had ideas,
and we did lots of fittings,

628
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:25,032
and we'd discuss ideas,

629
00:30:25,115 --> 00:30:29,786
and my costume designer, Deb McGuire,
she did a phenomenal job

630
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:33,040
coming up with the looks
for all this stuff.

631
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:37,711
And it was great to have an actor like Jim
involved and have ideas and pitches,

632
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:40,756
again, as we were, kind of,
creating the character,

633
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:42,924
and it just made everything better.

634
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:45,469
He's so good, man.
And all those little things add to it.

635
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:47,846
So, like, the haircut's perfect.

636
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,973
The mustache is perfect.
The outfit's perfect.

637
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:52,976
All the little things add to the character
so much, but it's...

638
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,644
Oh, I don't know which one he chose.

639
00:30:56,897 --> 00:30:59,483
<i>Oh, I hope they aren't
scanning me with X-rays.</i>

640
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:01,318
<i>I had kind of an embarrassing lunch.</i>

641
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:12,496
So, yeah. This was a fun idea,
something we had never really seen,

642
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:14,373
which is this idea
of Sonic to actually be able

643
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:16,583
to peek out of his ball shape
a little bit,

644
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:18,126
- felt like a fun...
- Oh, yeah.

645
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:21,046
And then tucking him in
with a stack of the sports equipment.

646
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:25,050
It just felt like a fun little image

647
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:29,179
of Sonic trying to disguise himself
amongst all these other balls,

648
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:33,308
but being able to actually peek out
and see some of the anxiety

649
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:35,352
as the drones close in.

650
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:37,562
Raccoons.

651
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:40,148
- There's a lot of animals on this movie.
- Yeah, ducks. We saw ducks.

652
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:41,691
- We saw raccoons.
- Turtles, ducks.

653
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:45,904
There was a possum scene
that didn't make the final cut.

654
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:47,364
Diva. The possum was a diva.

655
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,993
- Dogs. Baby ducks.
- Oh, yeah. You've got a Golden Retriever.

656
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,121
Humans.

657
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:59,418
- That's great. That's great.
- Yeah.

658
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:02,629
It's just, he could literally move,
and it's funny.

659
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:05,924
- Yeah.
- He's just so aware of his silhouette

660
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:08,176
in relation to the camera.

661
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:11,221
It's just incredible,
what he's able to do.

662
00:32:12,139 --> 00:32:14,474
Now, that was plugged in, right?
'Cause I saw some old footage.

663
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:16,309
- Some of them.
- That quill that's plugged in.

664
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:18,687
Yeah, definitely when Marsden
picked it up in the kitchen.

665
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,397
'Cause we needed it to have
that kind of glow.

666
00:32:21,148 --> 00:32:23,358
But this one is just,
when it's just kind of the...

667
00:32:25,152 --> 00:32:28,864
That was one of the ideas
we were developing very early on,

668
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:33,410
which is this idea of, like,
when Sonic is running around,

669
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:34,494
he's not necessarily...

670
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:37,247
the quills aren't glowing,
he's not generating the electricity,

671
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,374
but in the really emotional moments

672
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:43,378
where it's almost reaching a next level,

673
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:45,755
a deeper level of his power

674
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:48,216
that even he doesn't maybe
necessarily understand...

675
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,888
He's a kid.

676
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,561
That's such an exciting thing also
for a movie that...

677
00:33:00,854 --> 00:33:04,691
for a movie that, kind of, aims itself
towards all ages and everything,

678
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:06,610
you know what I mean.

679
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:09,488
How many movies are there
where the star's an action hero

680
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:12,157
and is a child? And a hedgehog?

681
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,201
- Right. But, you know...
- Yeah, it's very...

682
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:16,745
Wait. Is this the piece where...

683
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:24,127
There is a piece somewhere in this movie
where you use the video game animation

684
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:26,004
of me almost falling off
of something, right?

685
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,547
Yeah. That's in the hotel, right?

686
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:30,592
Yeah, that's an Easter egg,
when he gets to the edge of something,

687
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:33,094
he has to do
his precarious little balancing.

688
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:39,100
<i>I'm gonna puke!</i>

689
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:41,895
We did that a bunch of times.

690
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,107
These are the toughest.

691
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:51,821
Anything where Sonic and Tom
are actually interacting physically,

692
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:55,367
it's always tricky
to get it to look right.

693
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:13,593
<i>Doctor! Are you okay?</i>

694
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:16,096
<i>I saw a guy race out of here and thought...</i>

695
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,681
- These two worked amazing together.
- Yeah.

696
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:20,100
Lee and Jim worked incredible together.

697
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:21,601
Yeah. Lee Majdoub as Agent Stone.

698
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:25,188
I mean, they just really...
It just took on a life of its own.

699
00:34:25,272 --> 00:34:27,607
- I remember this particular being...
- Oh, my goodness.

700
00:34:27,691 --> 00:34:28,900
That was Jim's pitch.

701
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:31,111
And he was,
"Fine, put your hands in my mouth."

702
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:33,363
Exactly. "I'll do anything
in the name of comedy."

703
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:35,657
And rightly so.
I don't think anyone would...

704
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,618
He crushes.
Imagine how nerve-racking that must be.

705
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:39,703
As someone, you're like,

706
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:42,956
"Hey, all your scenes are to play the foil
to Jim Carrey being crazy."

707
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:48,920
Yeah. No, Agent Stone just ended up
such a great character.

708
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:52,382
And their relationship just really,
again, just...

709
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:54,676
<i>- Stone?
- Doctor?</i>

710
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,386
<i>Call Optical Illusions.</i>

711
00:34:57,137 --> 00:34:58,722
<i>Tell them I need new frames.</i>

712
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:01,808
Even throwing it like that.

713
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:03,977
<i>Oh, and bring that quill.</i>

714
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:06,479
<i>Yes, Doctor.</i>

715
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:10,984
Are you able to relax now?

716
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:16,197
Do you feel... 'Cause you've been going
nonstop for a very long time.

717
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:17,616
The movie's about to come out.

718
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:20,410
I was about to say, we are probably
two-and-a-half weeks... No.

719
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:21,620
- Is that it?
- Three weeks.

720
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:23,038
Three weeks. February 14th.

721
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:27,709
So, yes. I wouldn't say "relaxed"
is quite the right word.

722
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,878
I'm certainly excited for this
to get out there

723
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:32,005
for everyone to see
what we've been working on,

724
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:36,760
but I probably won't truly be able
to relax until sometime in late February.

725
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:39,512
<i>So, I'd like you to take me
to San Francisco</i>

726
00:35:39,596 --> 00:35:42,849
<i>so I can get back my rings and use them
to go to the mushroom planet.</i>

727
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:46,436
<i>- Mushroom planet.
- Yes!</i>

728
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:48,396
<i>Right.</i>

729
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:52,734
Okay. You're about to see
the second Jim Carrey reference of mine.

730
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:58,406
The first one was... the rewind.

731
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:02,535
I wonder if Jim knows that I did these
because of him.

732
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:03,662
He does now.

733
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:06,748
That's very exciting.
It's very exciting if he does.

734
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:09,000
This one is a gentle nod.

735
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:11,753
This one isn't a hard...
This one isn't as hard.

736
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,004
It's coming up in a bit.

737
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:17,384
So what's in front of James right now
in real life?

738
00:36:17,467 --> 00:36:21,054
- Just a little gray ball on a stand.
- A little gray ball on a stand.

739
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:23,723
Just a height reference
and eye line reference.

740
00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:25,350
I remember when I visited the set,

741
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:29,521
you had many different versions
of the Sonic things.

742
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:32,148
Right. What we had was... a simple one

743
00:36:32,232 --> 00:36:34,859
that was made out of rubber
that you could just throw around.

744
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:35,944
Yeah.

745
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:39,030
Just because things tend to get
a little beat up on a film set,

746
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:43,118
and then we had one that actually
had fur and quills

747
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,953
and was more a lighting reference

748
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,996
- but that...
- Here's the Carrey.

749
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:48,998
It's coming up.

750
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:51,835
<i>All right, I heard you the first time.
You don't have to pile it on.</i>

751
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:53,253
Very exciting.

752
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:56,214
<i>I'm wet. I'm cold.</i>

753
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:57,716
<i>There's a fish on my head!</i>

754
00:36:57,799 --> 00:36:59,175
That's supposed to be a reference to

755
00:36:59,259 --> 00:37:02,429
"Our pets' heads are falling off"
from <i>Dumb and Dumber.</i>

756
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:04,639
I hear it. It's great.

757
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:09,936
All right, this is one
of my favorite little bits.

758
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:11,354
And he's fluffy.

759
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:14,524
Fluffy Sonic. Adorable.

760
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:17,694
All right, whoever is making dolls,
time to make "Fluffy Sonic."

761
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:21,281
Again, how many things can we do
to have fun with Sonic's appearance?

762
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:25,618
And a fluffy Pomeranian version
seemed like a lot of fun.

763
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,580
<i>All right,
there's gonna be rules on this trip.</i>

764
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:31,499
I mean, if there's not
a Funko fluffy Sonic doll,

765
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:32,876
I don't know what's going on.

766
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:35,378
<i>Would you stop with the "Donut Lord"?</i>

767
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:37,797
<i>I have a name. It's Tom.</i>

768
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:39,424
<i>I'm Sonic.</i>

769
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:42,135
<i>Sonic. Sonic.</i>

770
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:44,929
<i>So you've been spying on us all for years.</i>

771
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:46,014
I love this.

772
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,098
<i>I wouldn't call it "spying."</i>

773
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:48,516
<i>We were all just hanging out,</i>

774
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,186
<i>only I wasn't invited
and no one knew I was there.</i>

775
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,772
<i>I can't believe Crazy Carl
was right all this time.</i>

776
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:56,566
<i>Yeah. You should call him
Super Observant Carl instead.</i>

777
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,986
That line from the table read
to when we did it made me laugh.

778
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:03,406
- You should call him Super Observant Carl.
- Great line. Loved that line.

779
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:05,867
This is a great gag, too.

780
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,119
- We played with this, too.
- Yeah.

781
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:11,080
It's hard not to do these speed gags.

782
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:13,041
They're just so fun. It's...

783
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:16,753
A mouse pad.

784
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,505
<i>When are we gonna get there?</i>

785
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:20,673
<i>We will get there when we get there.</i>

786
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:24,677
I remember I literally saw a cut of this
and I said,

787
00:38:24,761 --> 00:38:28,515
"Is there any way you can make that
paddle game go on for way too long?"

788
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:31,518
You were like, "Maybe. I don't know."

789
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:32,894
We have the technology.

790
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,396
This is gonna blow everybody's mind.

791
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,149
There's something called a phone booth
in this scene.

792
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:40,401
There was a lot of talk
about that, remember?

793
00:38:41,778 --> 00:38:42,612
Yeah.

794
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:44,239
Are kids gonna know what a phone booth is?

795
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:47,325
- Yeah. I remember that.
- Yeah. It's true.

796
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:48,952
They are hard to find these days.

797
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:50,119
<i>It's a payphone.</i>

798
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:51,663
<i>It's mostly for drug dealers and...</i>

799
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:53,581
It's a great line.

800
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:55,291
<i>Stay in the car.
I don't want anybody seeing you.</i>

801
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,335
<i>Fine.</i>

802
00:38:58,211 --> 00:39:00,797
Okay, where were you in this?
You're still...

803
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,131
Yeah, we were in Vancouver.

804
00:39:03,258 --> 00:39:05,593
And this was a location we found...

805
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:08,513
something that we thought
we could put a bunch of neon,

806
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,473
and park a bunch of hot rods in front of.

807
00:39:10,557 --> 00:39:12,684
But you built the inside of this.
I remember that.

808
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,853
Yeah, that was a stage.
The interior was a stage,

809
00:39:14,936 --> 00:39:16,688
exterior was... this was a location.

810
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:18,690
This has gotta be such a fun day to shoot.

811
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:19,774
Oh, yeah.

812
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:22,277
It's just nonsense outside.
It's craziness.

813
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:24,696
- Look at this.
- Yeah.

814
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:31,870
It's also very fun.
One of the reasons I love animation

815
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:36,457
is that, whether it's for whatever TV show
or this movie or something is that...

816
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,461
I'll do the voice so early on,

817
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:44,883
and then sometimes you'll be big with it,
or choose your moments with it,

818
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:47,385
and you have no idea
what the character's gonna be doing

819
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:50,138
until they actually animate it
a year and a half later.

820
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,265
We tried to do as many storyboards
as possible

821
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:54,726
and that's the same
when you work in animation, where,

822
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:57,061
yeah, you really wanna
figure out what the beats are,

823
00:39:57,145 --> 00:40:00,523
what the staging is, but it's also
really helpful for the cast and the crew

824
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:03,985
to be able to edit them
into a simple little story reel,

825
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:07,488
and to be able to show someone, like,
"Hey, this is what the scene is.

826
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:10,033
- This is what we're doing."
- Yup.

827
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:13,369
And that was always incredibly helpful,
especially with something like <i>Sonic,</i>

828
00:40:13,453 --> 00:40:14,871
where you just... He's not there.

829
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:19,208
I mean, there's no way to really show
what his action is when you're shooting.

830
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:21,878
So, having the storyboards,
having the previz

831
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:23,713
which is a fancier version of storyboards

832
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:28,051
that actually involves some very simple
computer graphics animation,

833
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:31,554
it was just so vital to...

834
00:40:31,638 --> 00:40:34,390
You should explain what previz is
a little bit more

835
00:40:34,474 --> 00:40:38,519
because in the animation world
it's not used as much as in this.

836
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:42,899
So previz is literally almost like a 3D
rendering of what the room will look like,

837
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:44,817
and what the characters
are gonna be doing, correct?

838
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:47,528
Right, right.
Very simple, very quickly assembled

839
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:50,531
in the interest of having
a first look at it

840
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:51,866
and be able to make changes.

841
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:55,411
But yeah, it's really just taking
the storyboard, which is a drawing,

842
00:40:55,495 --> 00:41:00,625
and building it in 3D
with actual 3D models, and some simple...

843
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:03,544
Sometimes if it involves humans,
you may do a motion capture shoot,

844
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:06,589
so you can actually have a character
moving around the environment

845
00:41:06,673 --> 00:41:11,094
and set up the camera accordingly
and design all the camera choreography.

846
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:13,596
We did a bit of that,
especially for action sequences.

847
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,556
-We did one for our drone highway,
-Yeah.

848
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,809
Our big drone highway sequence
later in the movie,

849
00:41:18,768 --> 00:41:21,396
where you want the cameras to be
really dynamic and exciting

850
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:24,857
and it's just hard to do that
in just a storyboard drawing

851
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:27,235
'cause you just end up doing
a lot of drawings,

852
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:29,195
and there's perspective changes.

853
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:34,200
And the best way to do it really is
to try to do some simple 3D work.

854
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:35,660
That really frees you up.

855
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,161
<i>I will tell people about this!</i>

856
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:39,038
How did you guys find Pally?

857
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:42,083
You know, I think...

858
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:44,335
- Is that a Toby?
- Yeah, Toby, one of the producers,

859
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:46,879
I think had pitched that
and it seemed great.

860
00:41:46,963 --> 00:41:48,089
Yeah.

861
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:51,718
So I saw a previz
of this entire thing inside.

862
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:53,594
- Yes.
- I remember that. You really...

863
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:55,430
Yeah, especially the bullet time,

864
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:59,809
because there is so much work that was
gonna need to go in to designing that.

865
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:01,644
So, was that a chili dog reference?

866
00:42:01,728 --> 00:42:03,271
He was bringing chili dogs, right?

867
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:05,773
There are some various, some of these...

868
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:08,317
I mean, the big one
is during the actual slow-mo sequence

869
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:10,403
- when he eats it off the waitress'...
- Yes.

870
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:14,574
...serving tray. But yeah, when I was
talking about the baseball field

871
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:18,327
and how there were a handful of scenes
that we just really loved.

872
00:42:18,411 --> 00:42:21,205
And kind of what we want
to do with the movie in terms of

873
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:23,291
just planting a flag and saying,

874
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,585
"This is it. This is our Sonic.
This is our tone."

875
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,587
That was basically the baseball field
but then,

876
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:30,757
also this bar fight frozen moment thing,

877
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:34,469
which of course we've all seen
frozen moment stuff and bullet time,

878
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,721
but we thought we could do
something really fun with Sonic

879
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:42,185
and bring his personality and humor
and just, kind of, make it our version

880
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:46,272
of slow-mo,
which we thought ended up really fun.

881
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,776
<i>- Make his a Mello Yello, please.
- Okay.</i>

882
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:53,696
And again, going back to just...
Sonic's in a disguise.

883
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,698
He's got a cowboy hat.
He's got sunglasses.

884
00:42:55,782 --> 00:42:57,742
- Give him props.
- Give him props.

885
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:59,368
Give him props and give him props.

886
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:06,375
This is really great set, too.

887
00:43:06,459 --> 00:43:07,460
- Great set.
- Yeah.

888
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:09,587
I got to see this set
when I visited Vancouver.

889
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:12,840
Just so much character, so much detail.

890
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:15,760
Our production design team
and our set decorators

891
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:18,179
they just knocked everything
out of the park.

892
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:21,682
It was so much fun to shoot in these sets.

893
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:23,893
<i>Oh, Sonic!</i>

894
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:25,978
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

895
00:43:26,646 --> 00:43:29,357
You know what I'm always impressed with?

896
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:34,612
First of all, the fans of this property
are unbelievable.

897
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:36,197
But unbelievable in many reasons.

898
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,700
One of which is, they love this character
very much. They want it...

899
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:42,703
They really do care about this property.

900
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:44,747
But also, they're so talented.

901
00:43:44,831 --> 00:43:46,707
- The fan art I've seen...
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

902
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:49,961
- It's insane. They're talented artists...
- It's one of my favorite things,

903
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:54,215
is when the fan and the artist community
embraces a character or a movie,

904
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:56,509
and then all you see in social media

905
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:59,470
is everyone doing their own take
or their own version of something,

906
00:43:59,554 --> 00:44:00,972
it's so cool.

907
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:04,725
And people for this property
in particular, to me, it's just...

908
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:06,477
The artists that are doing this,

909
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:09,230
the men and women who are doing this,
are amazing.

910
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:10,523
Yeah.

911
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:12,984
'Cause I've seen
so many cowboy Sonics already,

912
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:15,862
- and they're great.
- Right, right. Yeah.

913
00:44:15,945 --> 00:44:17,780
And people haven't even seen
the movie yet.

914
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:23,661
Pop-A-Shot.

915
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:30,126
Amazing. And also, I will say that
while we're talking about the community,

916
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:32,086
and how we got very lucky is a...

917
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:33,629
There have been a lot of people

918
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:36,799
or there have been a couple of people
who have done the Sonic voice before,

919
00:44:36,883 --> 00:44:38,467
- and have all been amazing.
- Yes.

920
00:44:38,551 --> 00:44:41,387
- I mean, very incredible performances...
- Yes. Yes.

921
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:43,556
- ...by multiple people.
- Yes.

922
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:46,726
So there was a piece also
that when this came out, the trailer,

923
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:51,063
I was hoping that people would
embrace me as a version of Sonic as well.

924
00:44:51,147 --> 00:44:53,691
And even from the first trailer,

925
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:56,194
people were very much on board
and supportive of me

926
00:44:56,277 --> 00:44:59,447
and it just made the whole process
even more exciting for me

927
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,574
- to enjoy it. You know what I mean?
- Amen.

928
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:05,578
It was very, very cool
of everybody to be supportive.

929
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:09,540
Yeah. We never thought of movie <i>Sonic</i>
as being a replacement

930
00:45:09,624 --> 00:45:11,209
for any of the other Sonics.

931
00:45:11,292 --> 00:45:13,794
No, 'cause Sonic exists
in so many different forms.

932
00:45:13,878 --> 00:45:17,465
- TV shows, games, the comic books.
- Video games.

933
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:19,592
There's just so much Sonic out there.

934
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:22,303
So this was just our own little addition
to the library.

935
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:26,057
It is very exciting though for me to think
that this could be one of the ways

936
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:28,559
- that people are introduced to Sonic.
- Sure.

937
00:45:28,643 --> 00:45:32,438
Kids. And then they go and they get
to see a Broadway performance.

938
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:35,650
Yeah, they get to see Ryan's
and everybody's performance...

939
00:45:36,484 --> 00:45:38,319
which I think will be...

940
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:40,238
I don't know, it's a very...

941
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:42,740
- Super cool.
- ...emotional, cool thing for me to think.

942
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:45,868
- This was a great day.
- Yeah.

943
00:45:49,664 --> 00:45:51,540
- Oh, yeah. You kept that in?
- Yeah.

944
00:45:53,376 --> 00:45:54,210
<i>Uh-oh!</i>

945
00:45:56,212 --> 00:45:57,713
How many days did this fight take?

946
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:02,927
You know, it was pretty contained.
It wasn't too terribly...

947
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:08,182
- Marsden can do real stunts.
- Oh, yeah. He's got the chops.

948
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,768
<i>Who do I get to beat up?</i>

949
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:13,688
<i>Hey! Has anybody seen my waitress?</i>

950
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:15,815
<i>Still waiting on those buffalo wings.</i>

951
00:46:17,066 --> 00:46:18,359
<i>Why, you!</i>

952
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:21,654
- Here you go. Three Stooges reference.
- Yeah.

953
00:46:24,532 --> 00:46:27,326
Doesn't even faze him,
'cause I'm wearing those soft gloves

954
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:30,579
<i>Really?</i>

955
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:34,333
- Oh, great song choice also.
- And here we go.

956
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:38,796
Oh, yeah. Yeah, we tried a lot of stuff
but we landed on this X Ambassadors thing.

957
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:40,423
It was just so perfect.

958
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:44,844
So cool and fun
and it was just a perfect fit.

959
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:46,846
- Look how much fun he's having.
- Oh, yeah.

960
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:48,514
- Like, give me a break.
- Yeah.

961
00:46:48,973 --> 00:46:50,641
- Tooth coming out of the mouth.
- Yeah.

962
00:46:54,979 --> 00:46:58,482
Yeah. This is another one where
we were able to continue tweaking...

963
00:46:59,108 --> 00:47:00,985
So what stopped in real life?

964
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:02,820
So, it was funny.

965
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:06,407
We did a bunch of tests
with high frame-rate photography

966
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:08,701
that would have
really slowed the footage down,

967
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:13,414
but what worked the best, ironically,
was just everyone holding their pose.

968
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:14,999
I mean, none of these people...

969
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:18,252
- There's no sort of tricks here...
- Chili dog.

970
00:47:18,336 --> 00:47:20,421
Yeah, exactly, gotta get
that reference in there.

971
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:22,840
So it was just photographed
with everyone holding still,

972
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:28,304
and the camera movement helped sell
the idea that they were frozen.

973
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:32,099
And it worked great. And then...

974
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:39,148
Were there any Easter eggs in that thing?

975
00:47:41,067 --> 00:47:42,860
- Or no?
- Yeah.

976
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:44,945
Not from the game though.

977
00:47:45,029 --> 00:47:47,615
I think some of them were just fun,
witty little...

978
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:49,825
What's the name of this restaurant?

979
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:53,454
- The Piston Pit. Yeah.
- Piston Pit.

980
00:47:58,084 --> 00:48:01,087
- It's a little Bugs Bunny matador. Yeah.
- It's perfect.

981
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:02,880
And again, I just...

982
00:48:03,339 --> 00:48:04,340
<i>Olé!</i>

983
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:08,886
That guy,
did he hit the camera in real life?

984
00:48:09,512 --> 00:48:10,971
No, he came close, but...

985
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:18,813
Toilet paper mummy.

986
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:22,566
<i>- So, should we get out of here?
- Yeah, time to go.</i>

987
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:23,734
I love that beat.

988
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:27,822
<i>That was amazing!
Wait a second. Did we even pay our tab?</i>

989
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:29,281
<i>It doesn't matter!</i>

990
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:31,367
<i>Watch this, watch this.
I always wanted to do this.</i>

991
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:34,954
I improvised that. 'Cause in real life
I always wanted to do that.

992
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:37,915
<i>- Get 'em!
- See ya, suckers!</i>

993
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:41,168
<i>I can't say for sure,
but I think they liked me.</i>

994
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:44,380
<i>Come on! Don't let 'em get away!</i>

995
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:47,967
<i>- Yes!
- Yeah!</i>

996
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:50,719
So this is a big moment
'cause together they achieved something.

997
00:48:50,803 --> 00:48:52,805
Exactly. They become real friends.

998
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:55,391
Tom was not thrilled about having
to help Sonic on his journey,

999
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:58,060
but now has learned a little bit more
about this little guy

1000
00:48:58,144 --> 00:49:00,479
and there's definitely a bond
that's been formed.

1001
00:49:01,564 --> 00:49:04,191
This is another,
just, I really love this scene.

1002
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:07,236
<i>Scratch another one off my list.</i>

1003
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:10,114
I remember we were watching
different cuts of this.

1004
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:12,324
I remember being like, "Hey, like,

1005
00:49:12,408 --> 00:49:13,993
the second that fight happens, man,

1006
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:17,079
you really feel them
really coming together."

1007
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:20,416
I remember,
even from the original first cut you had,

1008
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:24,628
I was like, "Wow. You've already captured
the energy and the excitement

1009
00:49:24,712 --> 00:49:25,963
between the two."

1010
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:27,548
It was very exciting to watch.

1011
00:49:29,467 --> 00:49:31,886
And you said this is the only movie
you will ever direct, right?

1012
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:34,472
You said, "This is it."
You're the opposite of Quentin Tarantino.

1013
00:49:34,555 --> 00:49:36,307
You want to do one and then you're done.

1014
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:39,268
No, I had an amazing time.
I am so fortunate.

1015
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:40,394
I would love...

1016
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:42,813
There it is. Upper left is when
he's kind of falling off.

1017
00:49:42,897 --> 00:49:44,356
Yep. Yep, yep. Yep.

1018
00:49:45,274 --> 00:49:47,359
- Good times.
- That shot, I mean, that,

1019
00:49:47,443 --> 00:49:50,571
it's, like, "Hey, let's do this thing
where Sonic is zipping all over the place

1020
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:51,780
and doing all these gags."

1021
00:49:51,864 --> 00:49:53,991
We're like, "Okay, great.
We need, like, ten gags."

1022
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:58,662
And so it becomes quite the challenge
to create all the little material,

1023
00:49:58,746 --> 00:50:01,999
and all the little actions,
but it really came together.

1024
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:04,084
By the way, now that you can pause this,

1025
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:06,921
now that you have some...
however you're watching this right now,

1026
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:10,090
you can pause it. You can actually look
at all of them at the same time.

1027
00:50:10,174 --> 00:50:11,342
Yeah. I'm excited for that.

1028
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,012
I like the pillow fight.

1029
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:17,223
A version of Sonic
having a pillow fight with himself.

1030
00:50:17,306 --> 00:50:19,099
- That was pretty funny.
- I didn't even see that one.

1031
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:20,017
Yeah.

1032
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:24,605
This is a great shot.
This is incredibly well-animated,

1033
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:27,566
I just really...
I just love the acting in here.

1034
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:30,611
This was another one that,
when you were designing,

1035
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:32,905
this is one of the first
that was totally done, right?

1036
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:36,742
I remember watching this and being
so proud to be a part of this movie.

1037
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:38,077
That's beautiful, Ben.

1038
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:42,456
'Cause it was a nice scene, too,
like we had all these funny ones then,

1039
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:43,999
the nice, sweet ones worked, too,

1040
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:46,377
- which I think was a big deal.
- Yeah. I mean, those are really...

1041
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:49,255
That's hands down the hardest stuff.

1042
00:50:49,338 --> 00:50:52,508
We know Sonic can run fast. We know
we can create cool action with him.

1043
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:57,096
But we want to him to be able to act
and for you to really sympathize with him.

1044
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:58,556
And I'm going to quote you, you said,

1045
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:01,016
"For Sonic, we need the best actor
in the universe."

1046
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:03,727
I think that's what you said.
And then you said, "Call Schwartz."

1047
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:06,981
- Is that accurate?
- That's 100% accurate.

1048
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:10,442
And then, when the movie wrapped,

1049
00:51:10,526 --> 00:51:13,654
you gave me that as a gift and you said,
"Will you be my real friend?"

1050
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:16,615
Did you keep any props?
I didn't get to keep any props in this,

1051
00:51:16,699 --> 00:51:18,200
because I didn't get to go to set much.

1052
00:51:18,284 --> 00:51:21,537
Of course I did not.
That would be completely inappropriate.

1053
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:24,456
Every thing I've ever done,
I've taken something from.

1054
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:26,875
I've asked the prop master, but...

1055
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:30,838
Even for, when I did little stuff
with <i>Star Wars,</i> I found something to grab.

1056
00:51:35,426 --> 00:51:37,928
<i>Maybe. Maybe not.</i>

1057
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:40,180
<i>Like I'd ever tell you.</i>

1058
00:51:42,391 --> 00:51:45,227
Agent Stone and Robotnik hot on the trail.

1059
00:51:45,311 --> 00:51:47,187
<i>...doesn't understand
the urgency of the matter.</i>

1060
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:51,150
<i>Really?</i>

1061
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:56,280
<i>Now that's what I call good cop, bad cop.</i>

1062
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:57,489
This is great.

1063
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:04,038
He did... Jim did six or seven
Vulcan neck pinch things

1064
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:08,334
where he just pinched his neck
and Stone just dropped to the ground.

1065
00:52:08,417 --> 00:52:12,087
But then, on this random take,
he did this throat chop. It's hilarious.

1066
00:52:12,171 --> 00:52:13,964
Did Lee know it was coming?

1067
00:52:14,048 --> 00:52:16,592
- I don't think so.
- That was so funny.

1068
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:17,968
But it's just great.

1069
00:52:20,346 --> 00:52:21,972
Good for Lee, man.

1070
00:52:22,765 --> 00:52:24,600
He was in for an adventure.

1071
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:26,477
He keeps up with him, too, which is great.

1072
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,561
Yeah, he was...

1073
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:30,064
He was up for everything.
He was fantastic.

1074
00:52:31,023 --> 00:52:33,359
<i>...and I'm not planning on dying
anytime soon.</i>

1075
00:52:33,442 --> 00:52:36,779
<i>Don't be so sure.
Your best friend is a magnet for danger.</i>

1076
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:40,032
<i>- Are you anointing yourself as the bestie?
- Mm-hmm.</i>

1077
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:43,827
Since we shot out on Vancouver Island
on a little stretch of highway,

1078
00:52:43,911 --> 00:52:46,497
we were fortunate to be able to control
for a couple of days.

1079
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:47,956
By the way, wasn't there a week

1080
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:50,793
where the weather was absolutely horrid
and ruined many things?

1081
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:53,295
- That is this exact sequence.
- Is that true?

1082
00:52:53,379 --> 00:52:56,715
I wouldn't say ruined. I would say,
it definitely created a little more work.

1083
00:52:56,799 --> 00:52:57,966
Whenever you're outside

1084
00:52:58,050 --> 00:52:59,593
- on location...
- Explain what happened.

1085
00:52:59,677 --> 00:53:02,304
- 'Cause I wasn't there.
- It just rained, almost nonstop.

1086
00:53:02,388 --> 00:53:05,099
- For this scene?
- Well, for the first day of shooting.

1087
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:08,936
It definitely... Especially the first half
of the day, it rained incredibly hard.

1088
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:13,816
And we have two units with all the toys,
all the drones, all the camera trucks,

1089
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:15,984
and the Ultimate Arms,

1090
00:53:16,068 --> 00:53:18,112
and everything you could possibly imagine,

1091
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:20,989
and it was all just kind of, like,
a little dead in the water

1092
00:53:21,073 --> 00:53:23,450
until the weather would clear,
we'd shoot a little bit,

1093
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:24,785
and then it would rain more.

1094
00:53:25,786 --> 00:53:29,498
So yeah, it was a little challenging
and certainly committed us

1095
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:32,501
to a certain kind of look in terms of
the overcast skies and everything.

1096
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:33,585
But, you can't tell.

1097
00:53:33,669 --> 00:53:37,756
I would never have known
that there was any environmental anything.

1098
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:40,634
This looks great.

1099
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:42,177
Thanks.

1100
00:53:42,261 --> 00:53:44,680
I love this. Once this action kicks in,

1101
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:47,933
this is another one of those sequences
that we had so much fun designing.

1102
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:50,728
And this idea of Robotnik
catching up to them

1103
00:53:50,811 --> 00:53:53,856
- and just unleashing all his drone stuff.
- This is the best.

1104
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:54,940
Yeah.

1105
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:57,067
- So funny.
- So how did this come about?

1106
00:53:57,151 --> 00:54:00,070
Was there, in the script, or was it like...
Is this the scene where he dances?

1107
00:54:00,404 --> 00:54:02,156
No, this is just him.

1108
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:04,158
It is revealing
that he's caught up to them.

1109
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:09,163
And this, kind of, fun little volume
of holographic stuff

1110
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:11,540
for him to be picking out
what he's gonna use to go after them.

1111
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:13,250
- And this is in his van, correct?
- Right.

1112
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:15,794
In that big, black van
that we saw at the very beginning.

1113
00:54:15,878 --> 00:54:19,131
So he's, sort of, activated
one of his drone tanks,

1114
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:21,049
and sent it after them.

1115
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:25,888
That little red thing
is a part of the video games

1116
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:27,556
and a lot of his bad boy things, too.

1117
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:29,266
- Mm-hmm.
- It's a fun little callback.

1118
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:31,477
Any time you miss an Easter egg,
I'm gonna say it.

1119
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:32,561
Yeah.

1120
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:39,985
Uh-oh. Here we go.

1121
00:54:41,028 --> 00:54:42,279
<i>Look, I get your poi...</i>

1122
00:54:44,406 --> 00:54:45,657
<i>Yeah!</i>

1123
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:52,748
This must have been
so exciting to shoot, too.

1124
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:56,585
Yeah, again having the previz,

1125
00:54:56,668 --> 00:54:59,087
so we really had a blueprint
for what we were after,

1126
00:54:59,171 --> 00:55:01,048
just makes such a huge difference.

1127
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:05,177
Also, I love that Sonic,
while all this crazy stuff is happening,

1128
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:07,012
- is still...
- Going after Tom.

1129
00:55:07,095 --> 00:55:09,598
Yeah, he's so fixated on the
"What's the real..."

1130
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:13,352
And you can see it here. He's really...
He feels very betrayed.

1131
00:55:13,936 --> 00:55:17,147
He'd give anything
to be part of this small town,

1132
00:55:17,231 --> 00:55:20,400
and Tom's given it up
and Sonic thinks he's crazy.

1133
00:55:20,901 --> 00:55:22,653
Also, I remember,
when we were doing these takes,

1134
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:24,905
that idea of you have to make sure
the emotion is coming through

1135
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:28,116
because it has to translate that
that's why these big sonic booms happen.

1136
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:30,744
Right. Yeah, we wanted there to be
a very clear relation between...

1137
00:55:30,828 --> 00:55:33,705
- I think you pulled that off really well.
- Oh, thanks.

1138
00:55:33,789 --> 00:55:35,958
Visually, with the lightning
and everything,

1139
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:40,587
but just it to be really clear
that this was very upsetting to him...

1140
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:43,882
and part of his emotional arc.

1141
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:48,679
<i>Guess I had a bonus life.</i>

1142
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:50,722
A nice, little...
Another little Easter egg.

1143
00:55:50,806 --> 00:55:52,599
<i>Oh, yeah, baby!</i>

1144
00:55:52,683 --> 00:55:55,936
<i>Sonic, one. Big tank, zero. I'm sorry.</i>

1145
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:58,313
<i>- Did we get that on camera?
- How are you not dead?</i>

1146
00:55:58,397 --> 00:56:00,107
<i>I have no idea.</i>

1147
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:01,483
<i>Do you see me dancing?</i>

1148
00:56:01,942 --> 00:56:04,027
Oh, I love that dancing, too.

1149
00:56:05,404 --> 00:56:07,239
"Do you see me dancing?"

1150
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:10,868
So yeah, this whole sequence
was built around this idea

1151
00:56:10,951 --> 00:56:13,328
of almost like a Russian nesting doll,

1152
00:56:13,412 --> 00:56:18,333
where, when you think they had won
or defeated Robotnik's tech,

1153
00:56:18,417 --> 00:56:21,003
that there was always
something else coming,

1154
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:25,215
and progressively smaller felt like
a real fun way to approach it.

1155
00:56:25,299 --> 00:56:28,594
How do you also do that, when there's
an actual physical door opening...

1156
00:56:28,677 --> 00:56:30,387
So what's happening in real life there?

1157
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:33,140
There's a guy out of frame,
out of range of the camera,

1158
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:35,893
that's actually operating the door
for the interaction.

1159
00:56:40,147 --> 00:56:41,189
<i>Incoming!</i>

1160
00:56:43,734 --> 00:56:46,445
<i>- It's my turn!
- You just had one. It's mine!</i>

1161
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:48,238
<i>Hey, stop fighting
or I'm taking that thing away!</i>

1162
00:56:48,322 --> 00:56:50,699
Gotta have the family road trip
dropped into the middle of this thing...

1163
00:56:52,993 --> 00:56:57,623
just to have a little fun before we resume
our life-threatening chase.

1164
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:05,505
Yeah, we ended up using CG
for all the Robotnik stuff,

1165
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:10,260
but there were certainly discussions
of maybe we could build this stuff,

1166
00:57:10,344 --> 00:57:13,263
but seemed like we would have
more freedom and flexibility.

1167
00:57:13,347 --> 00:57:14,932
Yeah, just to treat it...

1168
00:57:15,015 --> 00:57:17,059
- This looks great.
- Yeah, super cool.

1169
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:18,644
Oh, come on.

1170
00:57:18,727 --> 00:57:20,771
<i>Hey, everyone!
Welcome back to my livestream.</i>

1171
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:23,065
<i>Today we're destroying robots. Step one.</i>

1172
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:29,905
<i>Yes, we did it!</i>

1173
00:57:31,365 --> 00:57:32,532
No. No, he didn't.

1174
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:37,079
<i>We did not do it. Who is this guy?</i>

1175
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:39,706
- CG looks great.
- Thanks.

1176
00:57:42,668 --> 00:57:44,836
Did you work with
any of the animators before

1177
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:46,338
that worked on the CG?

1178
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:48,256
No, it was a new team.

1179
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:51,802
But I had a wonderful experience
working with them.

1180
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:55,847
They really,
really nailed Sonic's performance,

1181
00:57:55,931 --> 00:57:58,225
- and all his little mannerisms.
- They did incredible.

1182
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:00,936
- Yeah. Really charming performance.
- They really did.

1183
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:02,187
Funny.

1184
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:04,690
<i>Here. In this truck.
It's happening as we speak.</i>

1185
00:58:04,773 --> 00:58:06,441
That's great. That's new.

1186
00:58:06,525 --> 00:58:08,860
He wasn't holding an owner's manual
last time I saw it.

1187
00:58:08,944 --> 00:58:09,987
<i>Bring him in closer.</i>

1188
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:12,531
<i>- What?
- Bring it in closer! Hit the brakes.</i>

1189
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:13,824
<i>You mean this one?</i>

1190
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:15,993
<i>The other brakes!</i>

1191
00:58:26,003 --> 00:58:29,756
Seeing this in a movie theater,
I haven't seen it in a...

1192
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:32,134
We haven't had our premieres
or anything yet

1193
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:33,343
but I got to see a...

1194
00:58:33,427 --> 00:58:36,096
Close to this take, not this take.

1195
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:39,975
And seeing it in a movie theater
was so exciting,

1196
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:42,728
'cause even now,
I've only probably seen...

1197
00:58:42,811 --> 00:58:46,356
There's probably 20 people in that
small little theater that we saw it in.

1198
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:48,608
- But to see people laugh, it's so...
- Yeah.

1199
00:58:48,692 --> 00:58:50,736
It adds so much.
It's so fun to see it

1200
00:58:50,819 --> 00:58:53,238
- when the audience is into it.
- Especially for this type of movie, too.

1201
00:58:55,157 --> 00:58:57,242
There's a lot of comedy in this
and a lot of heart,

1202
00:58:57,325 --> 00:59:00,412
and you hope that people track it all
and it really seemed, like, all right.

1203
00:59:01,997 --> 00:59:04,750
This is a great little way
to end the sequence,

1204
00:59:04,833 --> 00:59:08,211
in the smallest way imaginable,
with this harmless little mini drone

1205
00:59:08,295 --> 00:59:10,756
that cuts the truck apart.

1206
00:59:10,839 --> 00:59:14,259
And then there's a little bomb
that they have to get rid of.

1207
00:59:14,342 --> 00:59:17,471
- So that truck is really chopped, right?
- It's really chopped, yeah.

1208
00:59:17,721 --> 00:59:19,514
<i>- Did I get it?
- Nope.</i>

1209
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:22,225
<i>Here. Hold still.</i>

1210
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:25,687
I don't think we were able
to return that one to the dealership.

1211
00:59:25,771 --> 00:59:29,566
I think that one's probably
in a collector's...

1212
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:33,737
- collection somewhere.
<i>- Nailed it!</i>

1213
00:59:34,321 --> 00:59:36,239
"Nailed it" is a callback to...

1214
00:59:37,199 --> 00:59:40,494
"Nailed it" is something I try to put in
a bunch of this voice-over stuff I do.

1215
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:41,995
I don't know if I told you that.

1216
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:44,915
I like there to be Easter eggs
within the characters that I voice.

1217
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:46,416
I'm not even doing a bit.

1218
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:50,629
So that like, "Nailed it,"
I've tried to slowly put that in.

1219
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:52,631
- It's in... Dewey Duck says it.
- It works great.

1220
00:59:52,714 --> 00:59:54,925
- Yeah, I think it works beautiful.
- It's your calling card.

1221
00:59:55,884 --> 00:59:56,927
"Nailed it."

1222
01:00:00,764 --> 01:00:01,973
Not looking good.

1223
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:08,355
This is great.

1224
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:10,607
He's so good.

1225
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:11,900
<i>Did we get 'em?</i>

1226
01:00:12,984 --> 01:00:14,611
<i>No, there they are.</i>

1227
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:17,197
<i>They are real survivors, those two.</i>

1228
01:00:22,369 --> 01:00:23,703
<i>Can we have a moment?</i>

1229
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:28,458
He's been grabbed by the mouth,
he's been choked.

1230
01:00:29,501 --> 01:00:31,795
<i>You know,
I won't miss you when you're gone.</i>

1231
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:34,005
He's so mean.

1232
01:00:35,841 --> 01:00:38,552
<i>But my machines are diligent, relentless.</i>

1233
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:40,470
<i>They're everything to me!</i>

1234
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,318
Agent Stone has been
holding on to that for him.

1235
01:00:55,402 --> 01:00:56,945
Mm-hmm. Since the house.

1236
01:00:57,028 --> 01:01:01,449
That's Japanese, in case it's not clear.
His little...

1237
01:01:04,995 --> 01:01:08,039
Now, does Jim break a lot,
like, laugh a lot or not really?

1238
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:10,500
I'm sorry. Like, break the scene...

1239
01:01:10,584 --> 01:01:13,378
- Or how does Lee not laugh at that?
- I don't know.

1240
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:15,463
Lord knows the crew was laughing.

1241
01:01:15,547 --> 01:01:16,965
You turn to your left and right,

1242
01:01:17,048 --> 01:01:19,134
you see a bunch of people
holding their laughs

1243
01:01:19,217 --> 01:01:23,597
and their faces are turning beet red
'cause no one wants to ruin a take.

1244
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:28,435
But this stuff's so funny that sometimes
it can really be hard to suppress.

1245
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:30,437
Natasha Rothwell.

1246
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:33,857
- She is so great. Yeah. Yeah.
- She is so funny.

1247
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:35,609
All this stuff in this...

1248
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:37,986
- Great comedian, too. And a writer.
- The sister-in-law.

1249
01:01:38,612 --> 01:01:41,364
- She's so funny.
- Yeah.

1250
01:01:41,448 --> 01:01:45,285
Especially, I mean, this whole sequence,
she just steals so many scenes.

1251
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:47,078
<i>I had to ditch my phone
so they couldn't track me.</i>

1252
01:01:47,162 --> 01:01:48,580
<i>- Ditch his phone?
- Track you?</i>

1253
01:01:48,663 --> 01:01:50,207
<i>- Uncle Tommy!
- Jojo!</i>

1254
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:53,126
You got a lot of funny people.
Pally's a comedic powerhouse.

1255
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:56,254
Natasha's really funny. Tika's great
in this. James is great in this.

1256
01:01:56,338 --> 01:02:00,175
If you're trying to make a comedy,
step one, hire funny people.

1257
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:04,179
<i>Little Lord Baby Jesus.</i>

1258
01:02:05,639 --> 01:02:06,640
She's great.

1259
01:02:07,098 --> 01:02:12,562
So, Jojo is actually a reference to
my wife, Joanna, whose nickname is Jojo.

1260
01:02:12,646 --> 01:02:14,773
- Is the dog named Jojo?
- No, the little girl.

1261
01:02:14,856 --> 01:02:15,982
Oh, the girl's named Jojo.

1262
01:02:16,066 --> 01:02:18,735
I was like, why would you make
a reference to your wife...

1263
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:22,072
Yeah, it was in thanks of all her support

1264
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:24,824
over the three-plus year process
of making this movie.

1265
01:02:24,908 --> 01:02:27,702
And gave me so much support.

1266
01:02:27,786 --> 01:02:29,162
What's the dog named?

1267
01:02:30,372 --> 01:02:32,207
- In the movie, it's Ozzy.
- Ozzy.

1268
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:33,875
Ozzy the dog.

1269
01:02:33,959 --> 01:02:35,418
- This is the dance.
- Yes.

1270
01:02:35,502 --> 01:02:40,423
When I saw this for the first time,
it was a very early screening of the film,

1271
01:02:40,507 --> 01:02:44,302
and I loved it so...

1272
01:02:44,386 --> 01:02:46,846
- 'Cause I didn't know it was gonna happen.
- Yeah.

1273
01:02:47,472 --> 01:02:51,476
It's a little non sequitur,
but absolutely perfect.

1274
01:02:51,559 --> 01:02:53,770
- Who chose the music for this?
- That was Jim's pitch.

1275
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:58,275
It was this little, kind of '70s hit,

1276
01:02:58,358 --> 01:03:02,112
early '70s I think, by The Poppy Family
called "Where Evil Grows."

1277
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:05,573
And Jim pitched it,
and it was just so wonderful and weird.

1278
01:03:05,657 --> 01:03:07,617
And yeah, it just...

1279
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:10,245
It just worked great.

1280
01:03:10,328 --> 01:03:12,789
- Was this in the script, the dance?
- This is a great gag,

1281
01:03:12,872 --> 01:03:15,542
blowing out the circuit breaker.

1282
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:17,460
- Evil laugh.
- Badniks at the top there

1283
01:03:17,544 --> 01:03:20,213
on one of the pieces of tape,
another Easter egg.

1284
01:03:20,297 --> 01:03:21,965
- What's Badniks?
- Badniks is what

1285
01:03:22,048 --> 01:03:26,845
Robotnik's stuff is referred to as
in the original game.

1286
01:03:26,928 --> 01:03:29,389
All his little robots.

1287
01:03:34,185 --> 01:03:37,480
So, just killing time
while the quill gets analyzed.

1288
01:03:52,871 --> 01:03:54,205
This is another really cool set.

1289
01:03:54,289 --> 01:03:57,334
You're getting to look, by the way,
of what that pod's gonna look like.

1290
01:03:57,417 --> 01:03:59,627
- Exactly. Yeah, that's the Egg...
- That's your first...

1291
01:03:59,711 --> 01:04:02,464
Eggpod back there.
It's got its engines folded up,

1292
01:04:02,547 --> 01:04:05,300
but just love the idea
of him having all his stuff with him...

1293
01:04:05,967 --> 01:04:10,055
in his mobile lab, and being able
to call it up at a moment's notice.

1294
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:13,683
<i>I just thought you might like a latte
with steamed Austrian goat milk.</i>

1295
01:04:14,601 --> 01:04:16,519
<i>What do I look like, an imbecile?</i>

1296
01:04:16,603 --> 01:04:19,814
<i>Of course I want a latte.
I love the way you make them!</i>

1297
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:25,987
So abusive, but so perfect together.

1298
01:04:26,654 --> 01:04:28,990
<i>Ready the prototype.</i>

1299
01:04:30,492 --> 01:04:31,951
So yeah, there it is.

1300
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:35,038
That's a cue for anybody
who played the video games,

1301
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:36,915
that's a huge reveal I feel like, right?

1302
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:38,041
Yeah, he had his little Eggmobile,

1303
01:04:38,792 --> 01:04:42,087
his little metal sphere
he would fly around in,

1304
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:46,216
and that was the inspiration for him
creating a little one-man fighter.

1305
01:04:47,175 --> 01:04:50,470
So we... did a little design work on it.

1306
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:54,224
I think we came up
with something super cool for his Eggpod.

1307
01:04:54,307 --> 01:04:56,101
Both you and I have those Genesis Minis.

1308
01:04:56,184 --> 01:04:59,270
And I just beat <i>Sonic 1</i> and <i>Sonic 2</i> again.

1309
01:04:59,354 --> 01:05:01,731
- God, they're so hard, so difficult.
- By the way,

1310
01:05:01,815 --> 01:05:03,441
so <i>Sonic 1,</i> you can get through it,

1311
01:05:03,525 --> 01:05:06,152
then when you get to the last
couple rounds, it's impossible.

1312
01:05:06,236 --> 01:05:07,987
And <i>Sonic 2,</i> when you get to the airship,

1313
01:05:08,071 --> 01:05:10,198
you need the "save" function
of this Genesis Mini.

1314
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:12,492
- Every 12 seconds, you need to save.
- Yes. But it's...

1315
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:13,576
- It's so hard.
- Yeah.

1316
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:17,080
- But so fun. It's where it all started.
- It's so good.

1317
01:05:17,163 --> 01:05:19,958
- It's where it all started.
- It's also because that game is so...

1318
01:05:20,625 --> 01:05:23,420
The whole game changes
by how fast you're going,

1319
01:05:23,503 --> 01:05:25,588
in a side-scroller back then
that didn't even exist.

1320
01:05:25,672 --> 01:05:28,091
- Yeah.
- The speed of it, it's so exciting

1321
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:30,718
and unruly
and makes you feel like a rebel.

1322
01:05:30,802 --> 01:05:32,804
Like, you're hardly in control of it

1323
01:05:32,887 --> 01:05:34,889
- half the time, it's a pinball.
- Yeah.

1324
01:05:34,973 --> 01:05:37,600
Yeah, you're like, "No, no, no."
But it's so fun.

1325
01:05:39,686 --> 01:05:42,689
Pinball reference to something
that's gonna happen in the movie later.

1326
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:44,441
- People have seen the movie.
- Maybe.

1327
01:05:44,524 --> 01:05:46,818
If they're listening to this,
they've seen it.

1328
01:05:46,901 --> 01:05:50,321
You should never start
a viewing experience with the commentary.

1329
01:05:50,405 --> 01:05:53,116
- With two people talking about...
- Ruining the movie for you

1330
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:54,451
at every turn.

1331
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:57,412
That'd be so funny
if that's how you watched it.

1332
01:05:57,495 --> 01:06:00,039
So stop right now if that's the case

1333
01:06:00,123 --> 01:06:03,251
- and switch over to the non-commentary...
- After an hour and six minutes.

1334
01:06:03,334 --> 01:06:04,335
Yeah.

1335
01:06:04,419 --> 01:06:06,087
<i>What year is it?
Is The Rock president?</i>

1336
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:08,798
- Yes, I improvised that.
- Is the Rock president?

1337
01:06:08,882 --> 01:06:10,008
I would vote for The Rock.

1338
01:06:10,091 --> 01:06:13,178
And by the way, The Rock
saw that in a commercial or something

1339
01:06:13,261 --> 01:06:14,804
- and retweeted it.
- Yes.

1340
01:06:14,888 --> 01:06:17,557
- And made everything full circle.
- And talked about playing <i>Sonic.</i>

1341
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,267
- As a kid.
- In college, yeah.

1342
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:20,935
<i>You got it. I am great at resting.</i>

1343
01:06:21,019 --> 01:06:22,520
<i>I rest faster than anybody.</i>

1344
01:06:22,604 --> 01:06:23,855
<i>Still talking.</i>

1345
01:06:23,938 --> 01:06:27,734
<i>First of all, can we take a moment to
acknowledge how under control I've been?</i>

1346
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:29,527
<i>- Amazing.
- Didn't freak out.</i>

1347
01:06:29,611 --> 01:06:31,863
<i>- No.
- Totally calm.</i>

1348
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:34,616
By the way, so Tika is a veterinarian.

1349
01:06:35,241 --> 01:06:36,868
- Correct? I'm sorry.
- Maddie...

1350
01:06:36,951 --> 01:06:38,077
Tika's character, Maddie.

1351
01:06:38,161 --> 01:06:40,413
So, that makes it even perfect, yeah,

1352
01:06:40,497 --> 01:06:42,916
that she knows how to
bring that hedgehog back to life.

1353
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:45,460
- Or at least examine him.
- Yes.

1354
01:06:45,543 --> 01:06:49,797
So, everybody has a nice little purpose
within the story, even more so,

1355
01:06:49,881 --> 01:06:52,091
than the relationship and the love
between the two of them.

1356
01:06:54,385 --> 01:06:56,095
So many beautiful people in one scene.

1357
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:59,474
Am I not in the movie
because I'm not that pretty?

1358
01:06:59,557 --> 01:07:00,725
Ben.

1359
01:07:02,185 --> 01:07:03,603
Well, we'll...

1360
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:06,564
We'll find a way to get you on camera
if we're able to do another one.

1361
01:07:07,815 --> 01:07:09,859
- I'll be some weird character...
- It'll be some doppelgänger.

1362
01:07:09,943 --> 01:07:11,444
...that talks like this.
Like, a weird talk.

1363
01:07:11,528 --> 01:07:13,029
Exactly. Have to discuss your voice.

1364
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:17,033
- Here we go, this is a big moment.
- Huge.

1365
01:07:18,117 --> 01:07:19,118
There they are.

1366
01:07:19,202 --> 01:07:20,620
What was it like designing those?

1367
01:07:22,497 --> 01:07:24,749
It was a process. I mean...

1368
01:07:25,166 --> 01:07:27,043
You know, you wanna, you wanna...

1369
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:29,462
- I mean, they're iconic.
- Well, in the game,

1370
01:07:29,546 --> 01:07:32,590
they pretty look like they're made
out of metal, at least the soles are

1371
01:07:32,674 --> 01:07:34,759
in order to withstand
the tremendous friction

1372
01:07:34,842 --> 01:07:37,887
generated by the speed of his running,

1373
01:07:37,971 --> 01:07:41,391
but we really loved the idea of him
getting them from Jojo,

1374
01:07:41,474 --> 01:07:45,186
and that it was a gift,
and his first gift of real shoes,

1375
01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:48,690
not hand-me-downs or mismatched stuff
that he'd been wearing in the whole movie.

1376
01:07:48,773 --> 01:07:50,858
And to create a real moment out of it.

1377
01:07:50,942 --> 01:07:53,278
It's also the first gift
he's ever gotten in his life, probably.

1378
01:07:53,361 --> 01:07:54,654
Yeah, exactly.

1379
01:07:55,822 --> 01:07:58,825
We should say about face stuff,
although I was making fun before.

1380
01:07:59,325 --> 01:08:02,870
They put black dots on my face
and we put a camera on it,

1381
01:08:02,954 --> 01:08:06,040
so at the beginning,
we did the script many, many times,

1382
01:08:06,124 --> 01:08:07,250
we did all the lines,

1383
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:09,335
you could see exactly
how my personal face did it,

1384
01:08:09,419 --> 01:08:11,754
and then I believe they matched
a lot of the emotion to that.

1385
01:08:11,838 --> 01:08:13,965
It's definitely great reference,
'cause, I mean,

1386
01:08:14,048 --> 01:08:18,177
faces are very complicated things
and expressions are very complicated.

1387
01:08:18,261 --> 01:08:20,597
Anytime you can have
a little bit of reference

1388
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:25,643
to give you an idea of what makes
the expression great or work...

1389
01:08:26,352 --> 01:08:27,562
you grab it.

1390
01:08:27,645 --> 01:08:30,189
You were very patient with us
with all those little dots on your face,

1391
01:08:30,273 --> 01:08:32,191
- 'cause it looks weird.
- We did it three or four times.

1392
01:08:32,275 --> 01:08:35,445
Maybe more, four or five.
And also you're tethered in by cords

1393
01:08:35,528 --> 01:08:36,946
- so you can't go as freely.
- Very unnatural.

1394
01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:39,324
Yeah. I remember you having
neck pain, right?

1395
01:08:39,407 --> 01:08:41,075
Yeah, because the weight of the camera...

1396
01:08:41,159 --> 01:08:44,287
- We did six-hour recording sessions.
- Thank you for your patience.

1397
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:46,581
- Really appreciate it.
- And then after we got enough

1398
01:08:46,664 --> 01:08:49,709
of the visual stuff, then it was back
to how I've done animation stuff

1399
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:51,586
- for the past 15 years of my life.
- Right.

1400
01:08:52,462 --> 01:08:53,713
And here we are, finally.

1401
01:08:54,172 --> 01:08:55,757
- And there's America.
- San Francisco.

1402
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:58,343
Now, how much did you film
in actual San Francisco?

1403
01:08:58,426 --> 01:09:01,429
Well, this is actually...
This street scene is still Vancouver.

1404
01:09:01,512 --> 01:09:02,722
- Wow.
- But we did shoot...

1405
01:09:04,057 --> 01:09:05,975
We had an additional plate shoot.

1406
01:09:06,059 --> 01:09:09,604
We were fortunate enough to grab
a bunch of stuff in San Francisco and...

1407
01:09:10,897 --> 01:09:13,608
for the action sequence that
is coming up in a bit.

1408
01:09:15,735 --> 01:09:17,654
This was a part of the trailers.

1409
01:09:17,737 --> 01:09:19,739
This was a big...
Or when they get to the elevator.

1410
01:09:20,907 --> 01:09:23,743
<i>Gotta get up there fast or we're gonna
have a human pancake on our hands.</i>

1411
01:09:24,285 --> 01:09:26,079
<i>You came all the way from Montana.</i>

1412
01:09:27,288 --> 01:09:28,915
<i>Yeah. That's how serious it is.</i>

1413
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:29,999
He's great.

1414
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:31,501
He's great.

1415
01:09:33,795 --> 01:09:34,796
<i>Okay.</i>

1416
01:09:36,673 --> 01:09:38,007
<i>You just saved a life.</i>

1417
01:09:38,091 --> 01:09:39,842
Let's push right through that moment.

1418
01:09:41,094 --> 01:09:42,428
Sonic in a gym bag.

1419
01:09:43,888 --> 01:09:46,891
I love this shot of him just peeking
through the little crack in the zipper,

1420
01:09:46,974 --> 01:09:47,975
and...

1421
01:09:48,059 --> 01:09:49,310
<i>I can't breathe in here.</i>

1422
01:09:51,646 --> 01:09:54,107
<i>Hello? Anybody there?</i>

1423
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:56,943
<i>- Do you have your child in that bag?
- No.</i>

1424
01:09:57,610 --> 01:09:59,278
<i>I mean, yes, it's a child,
but it's not mine.</i>

1425
01:09:59,362 --> 01:10:01,197
Great line, great look.

1426
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:02,281
<i>It's not your child.</i>

1427
01:10:02,949 --> 01:10:04,867
<i>Relax. I'm a cop, okay?</i>

1428
01:10:04,951 --> 01:10:06,411
<i>Plus, he likes it in there,
don't you, buddy?</i>

1429
01:10:06,494 --> 01:10:07,995
<i>Why would I like it in here?</i>

1430
01:10:08,079 --> 01:10:10,915
<i>This is worse than the dog cage
you had me in earlier.</i>

1431
01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:12,875
<i>Such a kidder.</i>

1432
01:10:13,584 --> 01:10:16,003
We did a hundred different versions
of that.

1433
01:10:18,756 --> 01:10:20,174
There's a pattern forming here.

1434
01:10:20,675 --> 01:10:22,927
I think we did a lot of versions
of everything.

1435
01:10:23,428 --> 01:10:25,346
- Yeah.
- But you have to. Again, you gotta just...

1436
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:26,347
keep pushing.

1437
01:10:26,431 --> 01:10:29,434
I remember I listened to
an interview of Jim Carrey

1438
01:10:29,809 --> 01:10:31,060
because I think he's amazing.

1439
01:10:31,352 --> 01:10:34,021
And he talked about how
he likes doing a lot of takes.

1440
01:10:34,105 --> 01:10:36,023
This is years ago,
so I don't know how different it is,

1441
01:10:36,107 --> 01:10:38,317
you know better than I, but he said,
"I like to do different takes,

1442
01:10:38,401 --> 01:10:40,027
because it's all about
what happens at the end.

1443
01:10:40,111 --> 01:10:41,904
Why not cover everything you can,

1444
01:10:41,988 --> 01:10:43,865
- so in the end, you can choose the best.
- You have options.

1445
01:10:43,948 --> 01:10:44,949
- Yes.
- Yes, absolutely.

1446
01:10:45,032 --> 01:10:48,077
In an interview about him, he's like,
I do enjoy taking a lot of takes...

1447
01:10:48,161 --> 01:10:50,872
If we're thinking about the end result
of the film, it's always helpful.

1448
01:10:50,955 --> 01:10:52,540
I was, like, "That's kind of amazing."

1449
01:10:55,835 --> 01:10:58,921
His little satchel was
a necessary little thing we designed

1450
01:10:59,005 --> 01:11:00,631
'cause obviously he's got these rings,

1451
01:11:00,715 --> 01:11:02,925
and he uses a lot of them
over the course of the movie,

1452
01:11:03,009 --> 01:11:06,012
but giving him his little pack...

1453
01:11:08,556 --> 01:11:09,640
was obviously very...

1454
01:11:10,975 --> 01:11:13,811
necessary up front, and to figure out
how that would work,

1455
01:11:13,895 --> 01:11:16,814
- and it was great.
- In the video game or any video game,

1456
01:11:16,898 --> 01:11:19,692
- how does any character hold anything?
- Where are the coins coming from?

1457
01:11:19,776 --> 01:11:20,651
Oh, my goodness.

1458
01:11:20,735 --> 01:11:22,987
The thing about the rings,
Mario's coins, thinking about...

1459
01:11:23,070 --> 01:11:25,031
Zelda has 30... or Link rather...

1460
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:27,325
has 30,000 things
in a little tiny satchel bag.

1461
01:11:27,408 --> 01:11:29,827
- Right. Yeah, exactly.
- And six different shields...

1462
01:11:30,578 --> 01:11:31,579
I always thought...

1463
01:11:31,662 --> 01:11:33,456
A little more logic
that you have to apply

1464
01:11:33,539 --> 01:11:35,708
- to something like that.
- When you're in the real world.

1465
01:11:35,792 --> 01:11:36,793
Yeah.

1466
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:42,131
This is all green screen...

1467
01:11:42,215 --> 01:11:44,467
in the back,
or are you on top of a building?

1468
01:11:44,634 --> 01:11:48,137
It is green screen. We had just
a little piece of the building built.

1469
01:11:48,221 --> 01:11:49,514
This little outcropping.

1470
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:53,768
Do you have a favorite scene
or you can't really say that?

1471
01:11:53,851 --> 01:11:55,728
- 'Cause it's calling...
- Different... Definitely,

1472
01:11:55,812 --> 01:11:57,814
like I was talking about before,
the baseball scene,

1473
01:11:57,897 --> 01:11:59,816
- in terms of what it represents.
- It's great.

1474
01:11:59,899 --> 01:12:02,318
It's funny, it's got some
great visual effects,

1475
01:12:02,401 --> 01:12:05,279
but it also has some real heart to it,
and really sets up

1476
01:12:05,363 --> 01:12:08,449
the emotion of the movie,
and Sonic, just as a character.

1477
01:12:09,242 --> 01:12:14,163
But, yeah, there's... And then, obviously,
the motel room. I just really love

1478
01:12:14,247 --> 01:12:17,375
the Sonic performance
and the emotion of that scene as well.

1479
01:12:17,917 --> 01:12:19,252
So, it's hard to pick, really.

1480
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:22,255
The emotion in this also, to me,
I liked when we were doing this scene,

1481
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:24,799
it was important to me and to you
to make sure...

1482
01:12:24,882 --> 01:12:27,718
It doesn't matter that he's animated.
It shouldn't even feel like he's animated.

1483
01:12:27,802 --> 01:12:30,513
It should feel like a little kid
is talking to James and Tika right now.

1484
01:12:30,596 --> 01:12:31,639
Right.

1485
01:12:31,722 --> 01:12:34,851
And then, it'll just bring weight
to a lot of the scenes.

1486
01:12:34,934 --> 01:12:37,562
And I think the animators pulled it off,

1487
01:12:37,645 --> 01:12:41,607
'cause it's one thing if I perform it,
but you have to make this character

1488
01:12:41,691 --> 01:12:43,484
really look like he's invested in stuff.

1489
01:12:43,568 --> 01:12:45,570
Yeah, and have that
moment of maturity, right?

1490
01:12:45,653 --> 01:12:47,238
- Yes.
- 'Cause this is when Sonic realizes

1491
01:12:47,321 --> 01:12:50,032
there's all these things he didn't
get to do or wasn't going to get to do.

1492
01:12:50,116 --> 01:12:51,701
And he wants to do them
and stay on Earth,

1493
01:12:51,784 --> 01:12:56,330
but he realizes, for the sake of his
friends, and for Tom and Maddie,

1494
01:12:56,414 --> 01:12:58,875
that would put them in danger
and put them at risk and so...

1495
01:12:59,333 --> 01:13:04,255
he makes a very selfless decision to go
even though he doesn't want to.

1496
01:13:04,338 --> 01:13:07,967
And this is our first view
of the Eggpod in action.

1497
01:13:11,095 --> 01:13:12,096
Now he's got...

1498
01:13:12,722 --> 01:13:15,141
- a red suit and the goggles.
- And you built this. I saw this.

1499
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:17,852
Yeah, we just built
the pod for him to sit in.

1500
01:13:17,935 --> 01:13:19,520
It was on a gimbal,
and on a green screen.

1501
01:13:21,147 --> 01:13:24,400
So we were able to composite it
into any environment we needed to.

1502
01:13:24,859 --> 01:13:27,820
I was in Vancouver when he was
shooting this and it was so cool.

1503
01:13:28,529 --> 01:13:29,697
Yeah, this is a really...

1504
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:34,744
This was, I think, the first time we had
James, Jim and Tika

1505
01:13:34,827 --> 01:13:38,789
all together doing a scene together.

1506
01:13:41,208 --> 01:13:43,878
And everyone had some
really funny pitches for this dialogue

1507
01:13:43,961 --> 01:13:45,338
and make it really...

1508
01:13:46,631 --> 01:13:47,632
It's great.

1509
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:50,551
<i>I punched him in the face.</i>

1510
01:13:50,635 --> 01:13:52,887
<i>He punched him right in the face!
It was awesome!</i>

1511
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:55,890
<i>The time for talking is over!
It's time to push buttons.</i>

1512
01:13:56,515 --> 01:14:00,227
And here we go.
With our first actual reference to Eggman.

1513
01:14:01,604 --> 01:14:03,481
<i>Confidence!</i>

1514
01:14:03,564 --> 01:14:05,608
<i>A fool's substitute for intelligence.</i>

1515
01:14:13,491 --> 01:14:14,784
<i>That's not good.</i>

1516
01:14:15,409 --> 01:14:17,411
This is a difficult CG scene.

1517
01:14:18,371 --> 01:14:21,082
- There's a lot going on. Lot of elements.
- So much going on.

1518
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:27,338
Oh, you're about to see a great
Jeff Fowler pitch that I love that he did.

1519
01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:34,720
<i>I was not expecting that.</i>

1520
01:14:35,096 --> 01:14:37,807
<i>But I was expecting not to expect
something, so it doesn't count.</i>

1521
01:14:38,557 --> 01:14:41,894
Yeah, the idea of Sonic
pushing them off the building

1522
01:14:41,978 --> 01:14:44,981
felt very unexpected and fun
and kind of the right way to keep going.

1523
01:14:45,064 --> 01:14:46,983
This was something we did
late in the game.

1524
01:14:47,066 --> 01:14:48,734
Not this, sorry. Not the bullet time.

1525
01:14:48,818 --> 01:14:50,361
Me going down and going...

1526
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:54,281
was a Fowler pitch
that I remember near the end.

1527
01:14:54,365 --> 01:14:56,200
- Yeah.
- And I was so happy.

1528
01:14:56,283 --> 01:14:57,410
Your pitch was so funny.

1529
01:14:57,493 --> 01:14:59,704
Well, all this personality
that comes out of Sonic

1530
01:14:59,787 --> 01:15:03,249
just messing with the stuff
and just taking all the time in the world

1531
01:15:03,332 --> 01:15:06,544
'cause he's so fast and just showboating,
you know,

1532
01:15:06,627 --> 01:15:08,170
is really fun and feels very...

1533
01:15:09,046 --> 01:15:10,256
-very Sonic-y,
-Yes.

1534
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:12,091
Very confident, very in control...

1535
01:15:13,884 --> 01:15:15,636
until he's not in control,

1536
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:18,848
because Robotnik has found a way
to level the playing field.

1537
01:15:19,724 --> 01:15:20,850
But yeah, all of this.

1538
01:15:20,933 --> 01:15:23,185
- This part. I love that.
- Yeah.

1539
01:15:24,478 --> 01:15:26,230
What a great reveal
for him to see the big bad.

1540
01:15:26,313 --> 01:15:27,314
Right.

1541
01:15:33,988 --> 01:15:35,990
So, the only two things that are not...

1542
01:15:37,408 --> 01:15:38,451
bullet time.

1543
01:15:39,827 --> 01:15:41,620
Now, I see we've dropped back
into real time.

1544
01:15:41,704 --> 01:15:44,040
- Right.
- So he got blasted, Sonic, and then...

1545
01:15:44,123 --> 01:15:45,583
He got blasted out of...

1546
01:15:45,666 --> 01:15:47,251
- And now, we're into real time.
- Right.

1547
01:15:47,334 --> 01:15:49,003
Kind of regular speed.

1548
01:15:49,462 --> 01:15:51,589
That's our visual effects supervisor,
Ged Wright,

1549
01:15:51,672 --> 01:15:53,007
that the camera just pushed past.

1550
01:15:54,175 --> 01:15:56,135
- Is that true?
- Uh-huh. A little cameo.

1551
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:01,891
Hey, that's an Easter egg.

1552
01:16:02,516 --> 01:16:05,436
When Sonic gets hurt, all of his rings
go like that, and the noise.

1553
01:16:05,519 --> 01:16:06,520
Uh-huh.

1554
01:16:07,146 --> 01:16:08,981
This is a <i>Back to the Future</i> reference.

1555
01:16:09,857 --> 01:16:12,068
<i>Glad you're here. Could use some help.</i>

1556
01:16:12,151 --> 01:16:13,903
<i>Old Bessie's about to give birth.</i>

1557
01:16:15,821 --> 01:16:17,114
Is that his father?

1558
01:16:17,198 --> 01:16:19,033
No, it's a farmer.

1559
01:16:19,116 --> 01:16:21,035
- Oh, I thought he said, "Hey, son."
- No.

1560
01:16:21,118 --> 01:16:22,369
Just a townsperson.

1561
01:16:22,953 --> 01:16:23,954
Farmer Zimmer.

1562
01:16:24,288 --> 01:16:26,749
- That was Hans Zimmer?
- No. Farmer Zimmer.

1563
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:28,667
I can't believe that's Hans Zimmer.

1564
01:16:28,751 --> 01:16:31,629
"Bounty hunting is a complicated sport."

1565
01:16:32,254 --> 01:16:33,255
That's not Hans Zimmer.

1566
01:16:33,339 --> 01:16:37,009
Werner Herzog is in complicated sport,
sorry, not Hans Zimmer.

1567
01:16:37,635 --> 01:16:40,971
I did a movie called <i>Flora & Ulysses</i>
which he was in, in Vancouver.

1568
01:16:41,055 --> 01:16:42,139
Small industry.

1569
01:16:42,223 --> 01:16:44,433
All right. Now we're off to the races.

1570
01:16:45,017 --> 01:16:47,686
Now, you must have had this
viz'd like crazy, you know.

1571
01:16:47,853 --> 01:16:49,563
Yes, we definitely did previz for this

1572
01:16:49,647 --> 01:16:51,857
to figure out what the angles were,
what the action was.

1573
01:16:51,941 --> 01:16:54,860
So, how much of this is filmed?
How much of this is on a crane?

1574
01:16:54,944 --> 01:16:58,197
- How much is dollied?
- A lot of this was filmed,

1575
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:00,908
and then some of it becomes
the reference material

1576
01:17:00,991 --> 01:17:04,954
for a 3D version
we're just mapping the world

1577
01:17:05,037 --> 01:17:06,455
and the buildings onto...

1578
01:17:07,289 --> 01:17:08,791
onto objects in 3D space.

1579
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:13,003
And this felt important,
to close the loop on our opening scene.

1580
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:15,548
By the way, if you remember,
the movie did not start like that,

1581
01:17:15,631 --> 01:17:19,135
so for your guys to find
those beautiful bookends was great.

1582
01:17:19,218 --> 01:17:20,052
Yeah.

1583
01:17:21,428 --> 01:17:23,347
And then, coming up, Smash Bros. pose.

1584
01:17:24,223 --> 01:17:25,808
- Love it. Another one.
- Uh-huh.

1585
01:17:26,725 --> 01:17:29,061
And that's alluding to
what's about to happen, also.

1586
01:17:29,145 --> 01:17:30,896
- Right. The "Visit Paris!"
- Yep.

1587
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:32,565
Sonic's got his bag of rings.

1588
01:17:41,323 --> 01:17:42,324
<i>Coming through!</i>

1589
01:17:44,368 --> 01:17:46,078
And Daniel Day-Lewis played that mime.

1590
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:54,211
It's gotta be fun for Jim to be filming
in Canada 'cause he's Canadian.

1591
01:17:54,295 --> 01:17:57,381
Oh, absolutely. And everyone in the crew
just loved having him there.

1592
01:17:58,966 --> 01:18:01,552
- All right. So tell us anything.
- This is just...

1593
01:18:01,969 --> 01:18:03,846
Everyone was really excited
about this early on,

1594
01:18:03,929 --> 01:18:07,474
this idea of using the rings to,
sort of, hop around the world

1595
01:18:07,558 --> 01:18:11,395
and have a chase sequence that's jumping
from The Great Wall to the pyramids,

1596
01:18:11,478 --> 01:18:15,608
and it just really felt like it had
a lot of scope and was very cinematic...

1597
01:18:15,691 --> 01:18:18,569
Also using the rings as transport
is something taken from the games?

1598
01:18:18,652 --> 01:18:20,696
'Cause you jump through
the big ring every now and then.

1599
01:18:20,779 --> 01:18:24,700
One thing we realized with this sequence
in early trailers,

1600
01:18:24,783 --> 01:18:28,329
the trail on Robotnik's Eggpod
was actually blue

1601
01:18:28,412 --> 01:18:30,372
because he's using
the power of Sonic's quill,

1602
01:18:30,456 --> 01:18:33,375
so they thought, "It would be
Sonic power, so it would be blue."

1603
01:18:33,751 --> 01:18:37,213
But then, a little down the line,
we were, like, "You know what though,

1604
01:18:37,296 --> 01:18:40,424
in these wide shots,
you just cannot beat red for villainy...

1605
01:18:40,507 --> 01:18:42,635
- Yeah, you're right.
- ...and for evil,"

1606
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:44,053
so we made that little adjustment,

1607
01:18:44,136 --> 01:18:45,763
- and it felt...
- It helps you track him, also.

1608
01:18:45,846 --> 01:18:46,931
Exactly.

1609
01:18:47,306 --> 01:18:48,974
Give it a little differentiation.

1610
01:18:51,602 --> 01:18:53,395
Now, this was on an island
in Vancouver, right?

1611
01:18:54,188 --> 01:18:56,023
- A little off of Vancouver?
- Yeah, we shot in a town called Ladysmith,

1612
01:18:56,106 --> 01:18:58,776
very charming little town,
which was very...

1613
01:18:58,859 --> 01:19:00,819
- gracious to host us.
- That's a great shot.

1614
01:19:03,405 --> 01:19:06,075
I like Vanc... I just filmed a movie
over there for three months,

1615
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:07,660
- and I loved it over there.
- Mm-hmm.

1616
01:19:08,202 --> 01:19:10,496
That's a great city.
Really wonderful people and...

1617
01:19:10,788 --> 01:19:13,165
beautiful... beautiful...

1618
01:19:14,625 --> 01:19:15,626
locations.

1619
01:19:17,169 --> 01:19:19,421
<i>...for a litany of invasive
exploratory procedures.</i>

1620
01:19:20,381 --> 01:19:22,049
<i>Any last words?</i>

1621
01:19:23,008 --> 01:19:25,678
<i>Guac. I like that word.</i>

1622
01:19:25,761 --> 01:19:26,929
Funny till the end.

1623
01:19:27,554 --> 01:19:29,765
<i>I don't have to tell you
how many scientific breakthroughs</i>

1624
01:19:29,848 --> 01:19:32,226
<i>have been made possible by animal testing.</i>

1625
01:19:32,309 --> 01:19:33,394
<i>You're being very selfish.</i>

1626
01:19:33,477 --> 01:19:34,645
<i>Going my way?</i>

1627
01:19:34,728 --> 01:19:35,938
<i>What the...</i>

1628
01:19:39,858 --> 01:19:41,819
They did so much of this, this fight,

1629
01:19:42,278 --> 01:19:43,612
- and they did so great.
- Really?

1630
01:19:43,696 --> 01:19:45,447
Yeah. They really, all this, kind of...

1631
01:19:46,657 --> 01:19:48,158
<i>I'm the Donut Lord, you son of a...</i>

1632
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:49,451
We were...

1633
01:19:53,289 --> 01:19:54,999
<i>Autopilot, adjust.</i>

1634
01:19:55,749 --> 01:19:57,167
<i>Why?</i>

1635
01:19:57,251 --> 01:20:00,045
<i>Why would you throw
your life away for this thing?</i>

1636
01:20:00,629 --> 01:20:02,006
<i>That's why I don't have friends.</i>

1637
01:20:02,089 --> 01:20:04,174
<i>Next thing you know,
you're somebody's best man.</i>

1638
01:20:04,258 --> 01:20:07,428
<i>They want to have the wedding out of town.
Like nobody has anything better to do!</i>

1639
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:09,471
That's great.

1640
01:20:10,848 --> 01:20:13,392
<i>Oh, yes. You were about to die.</i>

1641
01:20:15,644 --> 01:20:17,354
<i>That's our sheriff you're messing with.</i>

1642
01:20:18,814 --> 01:20:20,357
Hey, Pally gets a...

1643
01:20:20,899 --> 01:20:22,568
- a hero moment.
- A hero moment. Uh-huh.

1644
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:25,571
- Crazy Carl.
- Yeah, it's the townspeople coming to...

1645
01:20:26,655 --> 01:20:27,990
to defend their sheriff.

1646
01:20:29,491 --> 01:20:31,285
<i>- Careful.
- Just... Just put it away.</i>

1647
01:20:31,368 --> 01:20:32,578
<i>Tom?</i>

1648
01:20:46,258 --> 01:20:48,177
<i>I don't mean to be indelicate here,</i>

1649
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:51,680
<i>but someone should get some ice,
keep the body fresh.</i>

1650
01:20:53,474 --> 01:20:56,310
And you originally wanted fart noises
to come out of Sonic then, right?

1651
01:21:01,065 --> 01:21:02,358
<i>That little alien...</i>

1652
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:06,737
<i>knew more about being human
than you ever will.</i>

1653
01:21:07,404 --> 01:21:08,447
Here it comes.

1654
01:21:09,656 --> 01:21:11,075
<i>This was his home.</i>

1655
01:21:12,034 --> 01:21:13,494
<i>And he was my friend.</i>

1656
01:21:18,082 --> 01:21:20,501
So this was a place we wanted to get to

1657
01:21:21,001 --> 01:21:23,712
- very early on in the writing.
- Explain what's happening.

1658
01:21:23,962 --> 01:21:26,215
The idea of Sonic finally getting...

1659
01:21:26,632 --> 01:21:29,635
the friend that he's been after
his whole life, really,

1660
01:21:29,718 --> 01:21:31,845
and all this time
he's been alone on Earth,

1661
01:21:31,929 --> 01:21:35,140
and finally having that,
sort of, community...

1662
01:21:36,308 --> 01:21:38,727
and it just, sort of,
activating this whole new...

1663
01:21:39,478 --> 01:21:40,521
power in him.

1664
01:21:40,854 --> 01:21:44,942
And we're finally seeing Sonic in full
control of his powers. Fully realized.

1665
01:21:45,025 --> 01:21:46,860
And is this power
from something in the games?

1666
01:21:47,694 --> 01:21:49,113
No, I mean, there's certainly,

1667
01:21:49,196 --> 01:21:51,156
- there's Super Sonic, but that's not...
- Yes.

1668
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:53,117
That's not this,
'cause that would involve

1669
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:54,993
- Chaos Emeralds, obviously.
- Right.

1670
01:21:55,077 --> 01:21:57,955
So, in the interest of simplicity
for this movie...

1671
01:21:58,539 --> 01:22:02,000
we didn't include any of that.

1672
01:22:02,584 --> 01:22:07,131
It's really meant to just be
Sonic understanding his own powers.

1673
01:22:08,757 --> 01:22:09,842
And his emotions.

1674
01:22:11,510 --> 01:22:13,387
- And now he's got what he needs.
- Great.

1675
01:22:16,765 --> 01:22:19,351
Time to take care of Robotnik.

1676
01:22:22,062 --> 01:22:24,106
- He's at full power, wouldn't you say?
- Yeah.

1677
01:22:25,315 --> 01:22:27,025
- Confidence. Friends.
- Yep.

1678
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:28,944
The whole package.

1679
01:22:33,407 --> 01:22:37,703
And we see him strip Robotnik
of the quill power he was using.

1680
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,252
And this is a reference, too,
to a video game.

1681
01:22:46,503 --> 01:22:48,046
I've played many a Sonic pinball.

1682
01:22:49,965 --> 01:22:51,049
Yeah, this was just,

1683
01:22:51,133 --> 01:22:54,928
what can we do to just really create
an exciting visual, and just...

1684
01:22:57,598 --> 01:22:58,599
So cool.

1685
01:23:06,523 --> 01:23:07,649
<i>Now you've done it!</i>

1686
01:23:07,733 --> 01:23:09,026
<i>Guess what, Eggman?</i>

1687
01:23:09,109 --> 01:23:11,528
<i>I'm not leaving Earth. You are.</i>

1688
01:23:11,612 --> 01:23:13,822
It's gotta be a team effort.

1689
01:23:19,870 --> 01:23:20,954
It's a movie star.

1690
01:23:36,094 --> 01:23:37,513
Yeah, <i>coup de grâce.</i>

1691
01:23:51,693 --> 01:23:54,404
Donut Lord was listening to Sonic
about the mushroom planet.

1692
01:23:54,780 --> 01:23:57,032
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah. We've gone on a journey.

1693
01:23:58,075 --> 01:23:59,243
Knows all about it.

1694
01:24:02,663 --> 01:24:04,957
<i>- I told you, you got this.
- Hey, we got this.</i>

1695
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:06,708
So, this being the other moment

1696
01:24:06,792 --> 01:24:08,752
we're just really excited
to get to which is...

1697
01:24:09,545 --> 01:24:11,547
Sonic finally getting his high five.

1698
01:24:17,928 --> 01:24:19,888
<i>- I think these belong to you.
- Thank you very much.</i>

1699
01:24:21,431 --> 01:24:24,643
<i>- No more pushing people off of buildings.
- You know I can't promise that.</i>

1700
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:31,233
<i>- You did pretty good, space 'hog.
- Thanks, Donut Lord.</i>

1701
01:24:31,316 --> 01:24:34,444
<i>You're gonna have to explain
this "Donut Lord" thing.</i>

1702
01:24:34,528 --> 01:24:36,613
<i>Nope, sorry.
That's for me and the little guy. Right?</i>

1703
01:24:37,447 --> 01:24:39,700
<i>We got our thing,
you got your thing with your... sister.</i>

1704
01:24:39,783 --> 01:24:40,784
<i>Oh, my God, my sister.</i>

1705
01:24:40,867 --> 01:24:41,827
<i>Gotta go fast.</i>

1706
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:44,496
- Gotta go one more callback.
- It's a great cut.

1707
01:24:46,790 --> 01:24:48,875
Also, another little Easter egg,
"gotta go fast."

1708
01:24:48,959 --> 01:24:50,043
Uh-huh. Yeah.

1709
01:24:50,127 --> 01:24:51,461
<i>We can never go back there.</i>

1710
01:24:52,838 --> 01:24:53,839
<i>I mean, are we?</i>

1711
01:24:56,592 --> 01:24:58,760
<i>'Cause it kind of feels like
we're home right now.</i>

1712
01:24:59,595 --> 01:25:00,637
<i>Really?</i>

1713
01:25:02,347 --> 01:25:06,727
<i>I kind of feel like I checked
the "save a life" box off my bucket list.</i>

1714
01:25:09,313 --> 01:25:12,649
<i>Now all I want to do is spend my life
with the people I care about.</i>

1715
01:25:12,733 --> 01:25:14,484
- Movies are fun.
- They are.

1716
01:25:14,568 --> 01:25:18,196
Let me tell you a little something, Jeff.
Movies, they're super fun.

1717
01:25:19,531 --> 01:25:22,034
<i>All right, everybody. Nothing to see here.</i>

1718
01:25:22,367 --> 01:25:23,994
They're fun to make and to watch.

1719
01:25:25,245 --> 01:25:26,705
<i>Carl, I'll take that chain saw.</i>

1720
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:29,708
Oh, I love him.

1721
01:25:29,791 --> 01:25:31,168
<i>You act like you've never seen a fight</i>

1722
01:25:31,251 --> 01:25:33,086
<i>between an intergalactic space rodent</i>

1723
01:25:33,170 --> 01:25:35,756
<i>-and a robot with a doctorate</i>
-Intergalactic space rodent.

1724
01:25:36,214 --> 01:25:38,091
And a robot with a doctorate.

1725
01:25:40,177 --> 01:25:41,928
- Hey, another Easter egg.
- There we go.

1726
01:25:46,183 --> 01:25:49,102
I've heard so many versions of this
on YouTube, it's the best.

1727
01:25:49,811 --> 01:25:51,897
- It's a classic. Had to include it.
- It's the best.

1728
01:25:51,980 --> 01:25:54,775
The music in Sonic, the video games,
are all unbelievable.

1729
01:25:54,858 --> 01:25:56,360
- Fantastic. Yeah.
- Unbelievable.

1730
01:25:56,985 --> 01:25:58,195
I love video game music.

1731
01:26:00,739 --> 01:26:02,157
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Wachowski?</i>

1732
01:26:02,824 --> 01:26:03,825
<i>Yes?</i>

1733
01:26:06,703 --> 01:26:08,747
<i>A token of appreciation
from your government</i>

1734
01:26:08,830 --> 01:26:11,875
<i>for keeping quiet about recent incidents
which never occurred.</i>

1735
01:26:14,378 --> 01:26:15,629
<i>Wow!</i>

1736
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:18,799
<i>- Wonder what it is.
- Money to fix the house?</i>

1737
01:26:18,882 --> 01:26:21,134
<i>- Letter from the president?
- You'll see.</i>

1738
01:26:21,218 --> 01:26:22,636
<i>Okay.</i>

1739
01:26:25,764 --> 01:26:27,849
<i>- Olive Garden.
- Yeah.</i>

1740
01:26:27,933 --> 01:26:30,394
<i>The way you said "You'll see"
made me think</i>

1741
01:26:30,477 --> 01:26:32,312
<i>it was something better
than the things we said.</i>

1742
01:26:32,396 --> 01:26:34,564
<i>Have you tried their
Never Ending Pasta Bowl?</i>

1743
01:26:35,232 --> 01:26:36,692
<i>It never ends.</i>

1744
01:26:36,858 --> 01:26:38,819
Why did you choose that
as Tom's last name?

1745
01:26:39,277 --> 01:26:40,570
- Wachowski?
- Yep.

1746
01:26:42,364 --> 01:26:43,573
I don't think there was a...

1747
01:26:45,826 --> 01:26:48,203
a whole lot of reason behind it.

1748
01:26:48,286 --> 01:26:49,329
- Oh, really?
- It just...

1749
01:26:51,498 --> 01:26:53,333
seemed like
an appropriate small-town name.

1750
01:26:53,834 --> 01:26:56,837
<i>You haven't by any chance been in contact
with a certain alien creature</i>

1751
01:26:56,920 --> 01:26:58,255
<i>since the incident, have you?</i>

1752
01:26:58,338 --> 01:27:02,551
<i>Uncle Sam would love to have a chat
with him. Very casual. Brunch, perhaps.</i>

1753
01:27:04,344 --> 01:27:06,555
<i>You mean the little blue guy. No.</i>

1754
01:27:06,638 --> 01:27:08,640
<i>- No, nothing. No.
- Mm-mmm.</i>

1755
01:27:08,724 --> 01:27:10,892
<i>- Doubt we'll ever hear from him again.
- Mm-mmm.</i>

1756
01:27:11,977 --> 01:27:12,978
<i>Very well.</i>

1757
01:27:13,562 --> 01:27:14,980
<i>Okay.</i>

1758
01:27:16,022 --> 01:27:17,774
- Great look by Tika.
- Mm-hmm.

1759
01:27:19,276 --> 01:27:21,570
I love this last little bit of him
peeking in the door.

1760
01:27:22,195 --> 01:27:23,196
It's so stupid.

1761
01:27:26,575 --> 01:27:28,493
<i>So, do you guys wanna
watch a movie or what?</i>

1762
01:27:29,953 --> 01:27:31,329
I've been there the whole time.

1763
01:27:33,331 --> 01:27:36,293
Ozzy, the dog, perfectly on cue,
the head turned.

1764
01:27:36,376 --> 01:27:37,419
How did you get that?

1765
01:27:37,586 --> 01:27:39,045
- Pure accident.
- Is that true?

1766
01:27:39,129 --> 01:27:40,172
Yeah.

1767
01:27:40,255 --> 01:27:42,382
I think somebody was
shouting instruction at him

1768
01:27:42,466 --> 01:27:45,177
from off-camera and he just
happened to turn his head, so...

1769
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:46,928
which was great, and we could use it.

1770
01:27:49,681 --> 01:27:54,770
So, another moment we just always felt
was just really perfect was

1771
01:27:54,853 --> 01:27:57,898
to reunite Sonic with all of his stuff.
But now he's...

1772
01:27:57,981 --> 01:28:00,275
he's got a roof over his head,

1773
01:28:00,358 --> 01:28:03,862
and rather than being the outsider
looking in the window of the home,

1774
01:28:03,945 --> 01:28:06,239
he's in the home.

1775
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:08,116
How did you choose the props and stuff?

1776
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:11,036
It seems like a lot of '90s reference,
obviously Flash for the speed.

1777
01:28:11,119 --> 01:28:14,164
Yeah. Well, the other thing that
seemed like it would make sense

1778
01:28:14,247 --> 01:28:15,916
was you don't want Sonic
actually stealing,

1779
01:28:15,999 --> 01:28:19,211
like, kleptomaniac, stealing stuff
directly out of people's hands,

1780
01:28:19,294 --> 01:28:20,587
- like, a bunch of current...
- Right.

1781
01:28:20,670 --> 01:28:23,048
...you know, like sitting there
with a tablet and...

1782
01:28:23,131 --> 01:28:24,966
- So it's, like, stuff people left behind.
- Exactly.

1783
01:28:25,050 --> 01:28:27,469
It's, like, secondhand,
which also gives it a little more charm.

1784
01:28:27,552 --> 01:28:31,056
Where he's just taken stuff
people have discarded or don't want.

1785
01:28:32,224 --> 01:28:33,391
Race car bed. Perfect.

1786
01:28:33,975 --> 01:28:34,976
Yeah.

1787
01:28:37,229 --> 01:28:40,649
There is a reference to the Archie comic
series there, with the race car bed.

1788
01:28:41,858 --> 01:28:43,819
Lots of Easter eggs in there folks,
in that room.

1789
01:28:43,902 --> 01:28:46,446
- There's a SEGA Genesis.
- Yeah, tell 'em that.

1790
01:28:46,530 --> 01:28:48,490
Some of these things
you're just gonna have to go hunting for.

1791
01:28:48,573 --> 01:28:49,866
I think there's...

1792
01:28:50,408 --> 01:28:52,118
there's a lot, a lot to cover.

1793
01:28:54,538 --> 01:28:55,747
- We did...
- But they are there.

1794
01:28:56,540 --> 01:28:58,542
<i>I'm warning you. I've got nunchucks!</i>

1795
01:28:59,835 --> 01:29:04,005
That Sonic-Ozzy scene just felt right
to call back to at the end here,

1796
01:29:04,089 --> 01:29:06,758
of him saying
"You're Tom's best friend?

1797
01:29:06,842 --> 01:29:08,718
I don't see what the big deal is."

1798
01:29:08,802 --> 01:29:10,971
Then calling it back
for his last line in the film.

1799
01:29:11,054 --> 01:29:12,055
And then?

1800
01:29:12,138 --> 01:29:13,139
Yes.

1801
01:29:19,145 --> 01:29:20,564
Down, but not out.

1802
01:29:21,189 --> 01:29:22,190
Robotnik is...

1803
01:29:23,984 --> 01:29:25,861
making his way on the mushroom planet.

1804
01:29:26,319 --> 01:29:27,571
Agent Stone.

1805
01:29:30,323 --> 01:29:32,450
<i>Why don't you get a head start?</i>

1806
01:29:33,243 --> 01:29:35,871
He's turning into full Robotnik.

1807
01:29:37,205 --> 01:29:39,708
- Even the voice.
- Definitely with the mustache, the bald...

1808
01:29:40,375 --> 01:29:41,376
Right?

1809
01:29:42,460 --> 01:29:44,212
It's an evolution, for sure.

1810
01:29:44,588 --> 01:29:46,381
And I think we have more work to do.

1811
01:29:46,798 --> 01:29:49,050
But he's definitely
getting closer to it...

1812
01:29:49,134 --> 01:29:50,594
- In the right direction.
- Exactly.

1813
01:29:52,679 --> 01:29:53,722
This is all just...

1814
01:29:54,764 --> 01:29:56,600
scraps from his Eggpod...

1815
01:29:57,559 --> 01:29:59,060
on the back of his backpack there.

1816
01:29:59,603 --> 01:30:02,731
And he still has a quill,
which looks like maybe now it's...

1817
01:30:02,814 --> 01:30:04,858
managed to regenerate
a little bit of that energy.

1818
01:30:06,192 --> 01:30:07,235
That could be important.

1819
01:30:10,280 --> 01:30:11,656
So I had a lot of fun designing

1820
01:30:11,740 --> 01:30:13,950
- this mushroom planet and just...
- So cool.

1821
01:30:14,326 --> 01:30:16,953
...going about as far as we could, and...

1822
01:30:18,038 --> 01:30:21,124
just how many mushrooms,
how many fungi can we pack...

1823
01:30:21,625 --> 01:30:22,834
pack into this thing.

1824
01:30:25,045 --> 01:30:27,130
<i>Come on! Cheer up!</i>

1825
01:30:29,841 --> 01:30:32,135
There's the little guy, 16-bit.

1826
01:30:32,218 --> 01:30:34,512
Directed by Jeff Fowler.

1827
01:30:34,596 --> 01:30:36,848
- Jeff, you did an amazing job.
- Thanks, man. We had a blast.

1828
01:30:36,932 --> 01:30:37,933
Pretty incredible.

1829
01:30:38,016 --> 01:30:40,477
- I mean, this is just a dream for me.
- Great writers.

1830
01:30:40,936 --> 01:30:42,771
Combined three of my favorite things.

1831
01:30:43,271 --> 01:30:46,107
It was movies, animation, video games.

1832
01:30:46,191 --> 01:30:49,694
I mean, really, it was a dream,
and I had such an amazing experience.

1833
01:30:49,778 --> 01:30:52,822
I'm so proud of how it came out.
You did such a good job.

1834
01:30:52,906 --> 01:30:54,449
- I'm so proud to be a part of it.
- Thanks, man.

1835
01:30:54,532 --> 01:30:55,992
And to be a part of it the way...

1836
01:30:56,076 --> 01:30:58,119
I'm very excited
that it came out the way it did.

1837
01:30:58,203 --> 01:31:00,956
- Thank you, sir.
- Also, this end credits is unbelievable.

1838
01:31:01,039 --> 01:31:02,415
Oh, yeah.

1839
01:31:02,499 --> 01:31:06,795
It just felt kind of perfect
to incorporate

1840
01:31:06,878 --> 01:31:10,215
some of this imagery from the games
that everyone knows and loves,

1841
01:31:10,298 --> 01:31:13,259
and to end the movie, have people walk out
with just a big smile

1842
01:31:13,343 --> 01:31:16,596
- and seeing all this 16-bit greatness.
- Editors are amazing, by the way.

1843
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:19,766
Yes, I was so lucky with my entire crew.

1844
01:31:20,433 --> 01:31:22,185
All my cast, I mean, everyone was just...

1845
01:31:23,019 --> 01:31:25,355
I was about as lucky
as you can get with...

1846
01:31:26,690 --> 01:31:28,733
all the people involved that made this.

1847
01:31:33,113 --> 01:31:34,572
How did you guys decide...

1848
01:31:34,656 --> 01:31:37,158
Was it always like,
okay, let's bring it back to the bits...

1849
01:31:37,826 --> 01:31:39,244
for the end credits or no?

1850
01:31:39,869 --> 01:31:43,039
It was definitely a...
When we really kind of started...

1851
01:31:43,540 --> 01:31:46,334
getting to that point in the schedule
where we needed to start working on it

1852
01:31:46,418 --> 01:31:47,460
and designing it.

1853
01:31:47,544 --> 01:31:51,715
Picture Mill is who we worked with,
by the way, who did a fantastic job

1854
01:31:51,798 --> 01:31:54,718
realizing all of this, but yeah,
it just really, it felt like,

1855
01:31:54,801 --> 01:31:57,762
okay, we want to use some 16-bit,
but we also wanna,

1856
01:31:58,221 --> 01:32:00,724
sort of, visit some of these movie moments

1857
01:32:00,807 --> 01:32:04,144
and visualize the movie
in the style of the original game.

1858
01:32:04,227 --> 01:32:06,938
It just felt like a perfect union.

1859
01:32:07,022 --> 01:32:10,108
Oh, wait. There's one more scene.
What's this?

1860
01:32:11,359 --> 01:32:12,652
What's going on here?

1861
01:32:13,403 --> 01:32:14,404
I thought we were done.

1862
01:32:16,656 --> 01:32:18,575
I haven't seen the final of this yet.
This is very exciting.

1863
01:32:27,834 --> 01:32:28,918
Hello.

1864
01:32:29,919 --> 01:32:30,920
Tails.

1865
01:32:31,504 --> 01:32:32,797
<i>I found him.</i>

1866
01:32:32,881 --> 01:32:34,299
<i>I just hope I'm not too late.</i>

1867
01:32:34,382 --> 01:32:37,052
So we're very incredibly excited
to be able to do this.

1868
01:32:37,135 --> 01:32:39,804
And certainly, that was a question
we would get asked throughout the process,

1869
01:32:39,888 --> 01:32:43,933
are you gonna involve characters like
Tails and their fan favorites...

1870
01:32:44,350 --> 01:32:46,019
and, well...

1871
01:32:47,228 --> 01:32:49,939
We didn't chose to do it for this story,
we knew, just knew,

1872
01:32:50,023 --> 01:32:53,943
- that we had to kind of allude to...
- If there's more telling of this tale.

1873
01:32:54,027 --> 01:32:56,446
- Exactly. You have to.
- We had to get Sonic right, but now...

1874
01:32:56,863 --> 01:33:00,033
we certainly would love the opportunity
to build out the world

1875
01:33:00,116 --> 01:33:01,534
and bring in some of
these other characters

1876
01:33:01,618 --> 01:33:03,536
that everybody knows and loves.

1877
01:33:04,204 --> 01:33:06,664
Was there always... Was there...

1878
01:33:06,748 --> 01:33:07,916
Hey, voice of Sonic!

1879
01:33:07,999 --> 01:33:09,834
Hey, Ben Schwartz! Love that guy.

1880
01:33:09,918 --> 01:33:11,377
Was there always...

1881
01:33:12,462 --> 01:33:14,464
plans to have Tails at the very end of it?

1882
01:33:14,547 --> 01:33:16,633
- Yes, you didn't always... Yes.
- There was, right?

1883
01:33:16,716 --> 01:33:19,260
There was always meant to be
an Easter Egg teaser.

1884
01:33:20,220 --> 01:33:22,555
'Cause I love that.
I love when movies do that and say,

1885
01:33:22,639 --> 01:33:24,641
"Hey, we know you love these characters.

1886
01:33:25,683 --> 01:33:27,644
Maybe we weren't able to do it
in this movie

1887
01:33:27,727 --> 01:33:29,479
but we just want you to know
that it's coming.

1888
01:33:29,562 --> 01:33:31,940
- It's out there. It's part of the world."
- Yeah.

1889
01:33:32,023 --> 01:33:33,525
- We're taking care of you.
- We know.

1890
01:33:33,608 --> 01:33:35,777
- Yeah. We got you.
- We're just as excited as you are.

1891
01:33:36,903 --> 01:33:39,656
That'll be exciting. So now,
we have the credits here, obviously.

1892
01:33:39,739 --> 01:33:42,575
Please, look and recognize
how everything is amazing.

1893
01:33:42,659 --> 01:33:44,202
Is there anything
we didn't get to talk about?

1894
01:33:44,285 --> 01:33:46,162
So many people.
It takes so many people

1895
01:33:46,246 --> 01:33:47,831
to make these things, really, and...

1896
01:33:48,414 --> 01:33:51,126
each and every one of them
plays a very special part.

1897
01:33:52,085 --> 01:33:54,045
<i>Sonic,</i> being my first movie,

1898
01:33:54,129 --> 01:33:56,923
it really opened my eyes
to just how many people are involved...

1899
01:33:58,508 --> 01:34:00,176
but just what a great community.

1900
01:34:00,260 --> 01:34:03,012
What a great experience it is
when everyone comes together...

1901
01:34:03,096 --> 01:34:06,641
to problem solve, or to create...

1902
01:34:07,684 --> 01:34:10,603
solve the problems and create the movie.

1903
01:34:10,687 --> 01:34:12,063
It's just fantastic.

1904
01:34:12,147 --> 01:34:14,482
Is there anything you didn't get to say
while watching that you wanna say now?

1905
01:34:14,566 --> 01:34:16,276
Doesn't have to be about this.
About anything in the movie,

1906
01:34:16,359 --> 01:34:18,278
'cause we only have a minute or so left.

1907
01:34:18,361 --> 01:34:19,863
There's probably about
five minutes left, actually.

1908
01:34:19,946 --> 01:34:21,990
Oh, okay.
Well, I've had to pee for like an hour.

1909
01:34:22,323 --> 01:34:24,576
Five minutes, I'll explode.
It'll be great.

1910
01:34:24,659 --> 01:34:26,536
No, I just...

1911
01:34:26,619 --> 01:34:30,790
I had such a great time making this.
I'm so grateful and thankful

1912
01:34:30,874 --> 01:34:33,293
for all the people that helped us do it.

1913
01:34:34,210 --> 01:34:38,173
I had wonderful support
from all our producers, our studio.

1914
01:34:40,258 --> 01:34:45,930
My mentor, Tim Miller, was
a big part of getting me this movie and...

1915
01:34:46,764 --> 01:34:50,268
I certainly enjoyed a tremendous
amount of support from Neil Moritz

1916
01:34:50,351 --> 01:34:52,478
and all our friends at Paramount and SEGA,

1917
01:34:52,562 --> 01:34:56,399
and I just cannot be happier
with the movie we made.

1918
01:34:56,482 --> 01:34:59,402
I'm just so excited to get it out there
and to share it with audiences.

1919
01:34:59,485 --> 01:35:02,280
Tim Miller. If I didn't take that meeting
with Tim Miller,

1920
01:35:02,363 --> 01:35:03,823
I don't know what'd have happened.

1921
01:35:03,907 --> 01:35:05,825
- That's right.
- It just happened to be perfect timing.

1922
01:35:05,909 --> 01:35:07,035
It was destiny.

1923
01:35:07,118 --> 01:35:09,579
Yeah. When I had that meeting,
did you know I was coming in?

1924
01:35:09,662 --> 01:35:11,206
Did you know
you were gonna try to use me?

1925
01:35:11,289 --> 01:35:13,374
No, that was the fun
of sitting next to him,

1926
01:35:13,458 --> 01:35:15,835
because, every now and then,
I'd be sitting there at my desk

1927
01:35:15,919 --> 01:35:18,087
doing my work,
and I'd turn around, and it'd be...

1928
01:35:18,171 --> 01:35:21,507
Ben Schwartz, or whoever
he happened to be taking a meeting with

1929
01:35:21,591 --> 01:35:23,509
- for a project, so it was always...
- Yeah.

1930
01:35:23,593 --> 01:35:25,011
So if I didn't have that meeting,

1931
01:35:25,094 --> 01:35:27,013
there's a chance
that I may not have even done it.

1932
01:35:27,096 --> 01:35:29,057
- I don't know.
- Wow. How crazy.

1933
01:35:29,140 --> 01:35:31,184
- We don't even have to answer that.
- Or think about it.

1934
01:35:31,267 --> 01:35:33,770
- No, we don't even wanna think about that.
- No, we don't.

1935
01:35:34,479 --> 01:35:37,690
I am very...
very proud and very excited

1936
01:35:37,774 --> 01:35:39,859
- to be a part of this movie.
- Thanks, man.

1937
01:35:39,943 --> 01:35:41,569
I'm so excited with how it came out.

1938
01:35:41,653 --> 01:35:46,741
I've also watched you as a director
from before you started rolling till now,

1939
01:35:46,824 --> 01:35:50,286
and because of the VO aspect of it,
I'm with you...

1940
01:35:50,370 --> 01:35:52,038
I'm in post a lot with you.

1941
01:35:52,455 --> 01:35:53,915
And it has been so amazing

1942
01:35:53,998 --> 01:35:55,833
-to watch you work,
-Thanks, man.

1943
01:35:55,917 --> 01:35:58,127
And also keep your cool
and also stay creative,

1944
01:35:58,211 --> 01:36:01,714
and find ways around anything.
You did a great job, and also,

1945
01:36:01,798 --> 01:36:03,883
for your first movie,
it's pretty magnificent.

1946
01:36:03,967 --> 01:36:06,469
Thanks, brother.
Movies, you know, they're tough.

1947
01:36:06,552 --> 01:36:09,180
It's a long process, but it should be fun.

1948
01:36:09,264 --> 01:36:12,892
And just working with people like you,

1949
01:36:12,976 --> 01:36:15,937
and just the joy that comes
from that creative collaboration,

1950
01:36:16,020 --> 01:36:18,189
it's just fantastic, and...

1951
01:36:18,564 --> 01:36:20,858
yes, thank you for all you've done
for this film

1952
01:36:20,942 --> 01:36:24,362
and continue to do promoting it
and talking to the fans, and...

1953
01:36:24,445 --> 01:36:27,824
the love you have for this character
and this franchise

1954
01:36:27,907 --> 01:36:30,576
is so real and it's just fantastic.

1955
01:36:31,119 --> 01:36:32,537
We're so fortunate to have your help.

1956
01:36:32,620 --> 01:36:33,997
- You're very kind.
- We're very lucky.

1957
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:35,790
You and I got very lucky
that we were able...

1958
01:36:35,873 --> 01:36:38,918
And I appreciate you returning
my text messages from time to time

1959
01:36:39,002 --> 01:36:41,963
when I had a moment,
when I'm shooting, when I needed it.

1960
01:36:42,505 --> 01:36:44,424
- I needed a laugh...
- Of course.

1961
01:36:44,507 --> 01:36:47,260
...or needed some insights.
So you're a resource, for sure.

1962
01:36:48,594 --> 01:36:50,179
Let's make some more of these, huh?

1963
01:36:50,263 --> 01:36:52,473
- How many more do you want to do?
- Let's start now.

1964
01:36:52,557 --> 01:36:56,060
How many more? Let's say, by the way,
by the time someone's watching this...

1965
01:36:57,020 --> 01:37:01,024
they'll know if the story is continuing.
They know more than we know right now.

1966
01:37:01,524 --> 01:37:05,528
The movie has not come out yet, but we
hope that it is received the way that...

1967
01:37:05,611 --> 01:37:07,405
with the amount of love
that we put it out.

1968
01:37:07,488 --> 01:37:10,366
- Absolutely.
- If the audiences can experience

1969
01:37:10,450 --> 01:37:13,328
even just a fraction of the joy
and fun we had making it,

1970
01:37:13,411 --> 01:37:15,830
then I think we'd be in great shape.
But...

1971
01:37:17,248 --> 01:37:18,458
fingers crossed.

1972
01:37:19,208 --> 01:37:21,127
Well, Jeff, you're a wonderful human.

1973
01:37:21,878 --> 01:37:23,046
Now with child.

1974
01:37:23,921 --> 01:37:25,590
That was the other wonderful thing
that happened this year.

1975
01:37:25,673 --> 01:37:27,592
Throughout this process, you had a kid.

1976
01:37:27,675 --> 01:37:29,385
- I did.
- And you named the kid Sonic.

1977
01:37:30,011 --> 01:37:31,429
True dedication.

1978
01:37:31,512 --> 01:37:32,847
- Yeah.
- I'll have it changed later,

1979
01:37:32,930 --> 01:37:34,724
but it felt good for the crew
and morale.

1980
01:37:34,807 --> 01:37:35,933
It had to be, yeah.

1981
01:37:36,017 --> 01:37:38,603
- Guys, I had a child, I had a son.
- Boy Sonic...

1982
01:37:38,686 --> 01:37:39,854
I named him Sonic.

1983
01:37:40,271 --> 01:37:41,397
Let's finish this movie.

1984
01:37:41,481 --> 01:37:42,607
- Yeah.
- And make it great.

1985
01:37:42,690 --> 01:37:43,775
And it worked.

1986
01:37:44,233 --> 01:37:45,401
It absolutely worked.

1987
01:37:46,694 --> 01:37:49,030
Thank you, Paramount. Thank you, Toby.

1988
01:37:49,113 --> 01:37:50,948
Thank you, Neil. Thank you, Jeff.

1989
01:37:51,449 --> 01:37:54,452
- Look at how long...
- There's so many people to thank.

1990
01:37:54,535 --> 01:37:56,496
Is there another thing at the very end?
No.

1991
01:37:57,663 --> 01:37:59,832
We're done. This is it.

1992
01:38:00,875 --> 01:38:02,377
Unless I'm forgetting something.

1993
01:38:04,128 --> 01:38:07,882
What if they've added something
you have no idea about at the very end?

1994
01:38:07,965 --> 01:38:11,177
You finished your color timing,
you finished your sound,

1995
01:38:11,260 --> 01:38:12,637
and then you get there
and at the very end,

1996
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:14,680
it's the weirdest thing
you did not say "yes" to.

1997
01:38:14,764 --> 01:38:15,973
That would be wild.

1998
01:38:21,354 --> 01:38:22,480
Canada.

1999
01:38:22,939 --> 01:38:25,316
- Thanks everybody for listening.
- Very thankful to them.

2000
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:26,692
- Yeah.
- Jeff, any final words?

2001
01:38:27,402 --> 01:38:30,321
Hope you enjoyed the film
and thanks for listening, and...

2002
01:38:30,696 --> 01:38:32,031
yeah, we'll catch you later.

2003
01:38:32,407 --> 01:38:33,574
Bye, everyone.

2004
01:38:34,117 --> 01:38:35,159
See ya.
