1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:03,254
Previously on Arrow...

2
00:00:03,421 --> 00:00:06,799
I have a village, too,
run by a government strongman named Kovar.

3
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:08,885
You will go to Russia and find my parents,

4
00:00:09,093 --> 00:00:10,928
and tell them what happened
to me and Vlad.

5
00:00:12,305 --> 00:00:13,389
Taiana, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:20,855 --> 00:00:23,524
Tell me who this "Prometheus" is.

7
00:00:23,858 --> 00:00:25,538
I guess you know
what I've been up to, huh?

8
00:00:25,568 --> 00:00:27,445
Remember, I'm always ten steps
ahead of you.

9
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:30,489
- What's going on?
- Chase is gone.

10
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:32,950
- So is Oliver.
- We have to assume Chase has him.

11
00:00:33,284 --> 00:00:34,744
Just make sure he suffers.

12
00:00:35,244 --> 00:00:36,913
That was always the plan.

13
00:00:38,873 --> 00:00:40,166
Did you hesitate at all

14
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:41,375
when you killed him?

15
00:00:41,584 --> 00:00:44,629
Or was he just another name
you crossed off your list?

16
00:00:45,463 --> 00:00:47,715
If you kill me,
you'll only really be killing yourself.

17
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:52,011
Five, four, three, two, one...

18
00:00:57,892 --> 00:00:59,560
Hundred and forty-five seconds.

19
00:00:59,936 --> 00:01:03,147
That's how long my father struggled
under the water before he died.

20
00:01:04,148 --> 00:01:07,902
According to my father's autopsy,
your arrow pierced his aortic arch,

21
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,237
but it didn't kill him.

22
00:01:09,487 --> 00:01:11,781
No, he was still conscious enough

23
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:15,451
to feel his lungs filling with water
for 145 seconds.

24
00:01:15,785 --> 00:01:17,411
And here you were

25
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:21,707
bragging about a plan
more intricate than torture.

26
00:01:27,672 --> 00:01:29,966
Did you ever think about
why I chose the name Prometheus?

27
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:34,095
He challenged the omnipotence of the gods.

28
00:01:34,345 --> 00:01:38,849
See, because like you,
they play judge, jury and executioner.

29
00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:42,395
But Prometheus took away their power.

30
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,772
If that's what you're gonna do to me,

31
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:49,360
you'll need to come up with something
better than whatever this is.

32
00:01:50,486 --> 00:01:51,654
I did.

33
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:55,700
And the only way for you to stop it

34
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:57,034
is to confess.

35
00:01:57,201 --> 00:02:00,288
- I killed your father.
- Nothing so pedestrian.

36
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:03,749
I want you to tell me your secret, Oliver.

37
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:06,877
I want you to confess to the one thing

38
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:09,088
that you've been afraid
to admit to yourself.

39
00:02:09,297 --> 00:02:11,048
How many times am I going to tell you

40
00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:13,217
that I don't know
what you're talking about?

41
00:02:14,302 --> 00:02:15,344
Fine.

42
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:17,680
You'll come around eventually.

43
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:19,724
Now, where were we?

44
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:23,811
One forty-five, one forty-four,
one forty-three...

45
00:02:31,444 --> 00:02:35,114
Bandages and water will not help me.

46
00:02:35,406 --> 00:02:38,075
Before you die, tell us what you meant.

47
00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:40,286
You said if we Kill you,
we kill ourselves.

48
00:02:40,578 --> 00:02:41,579
Why?

49
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:44,832
You will find out soon enough.

50
00:02:46,584 --> 00:02:48,127
You're gonna tell me now

51
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:51,130
or I'm going to dig that
bullet out of your arm.

52
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:52,548
Go to hell.

53
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,343
Oliver! Oliver!

54
00:02:56,344 --> 00:02:57,345
What are you doing?

55
00:02:57,553 --> 00:02:59,597
He will never tell you truth
in that much pain.

56
00:03:05,311 --> 00:03:07,772
Does this has to do with your deal
with Kovar, yes?

57
00:03:10,191 --> 00:03:11,192
Samovol'shchina.

58
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,529
If you know what it was or what is coming,

59
00:03:16,614 --> 00:03:18,657
you will beg Kovar to spare you.

60
00:03:21,202 --> 00:03:25,122
And you are no one's hero.

61
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,208
Everything

62
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:30,044
and everyone that you love,

63
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:33,339
will wither

64
00:03:34,465 --> 00:03:36,592
and die at your touch.

65
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:53,567
Da.

66
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,277
Good riddance.

67
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,571
What do we do about Kovar?

68
00:03:57,988 --> 00:03:59,156
What does it matter?

69
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:02,243
Our Pakhan is dead.
We must swear in a new one.

70
00:04:02,535 --> 00:04:03,744
There are men loyal to us,

71
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:06,288
and men loyal to Gregor,
all without Pakhan.

72
00:04:06,497 --> 00:04:07,577
How do we choose a new one?

73
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:10,167
Pakhan is determined by seniority.

74
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:23,973
Why is he doing that?

75
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:26,809
It's for journey to afterlife.

76
00:04:27,393 --> 00:04:29,186
Makes good gift in heaven,

77
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:31,856
but even better bribe for Satan.

78
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,611
Da.

79
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,702
You can get in there, too.
You're one of us.

80
00:05:56,941 --> 00:05:57,942
Ay.

81
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,402
Viktor, I think he cut into tendon.

82
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,571
I don't think he's very happy
you're Pakhan.

83
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,865
You think? I know.

84
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:08,994
I wish there was less painful transfer
of power in Bratva.

85
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:10,663
What are we gonna do about Kovar?

86
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:13,791
You're asking for yourself
or you're asking for Bratva?

87
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:16,719
Anatoly, Gregor made it sound like
all of us were going to be killed.

88
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:17,920
Samovol'shchina.

89
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:20,232
"Do as you will."
But he made it sound like there was some...

90
00:06:20,256 --> 00:06:23,592
Some deeper meaning? Yeah, it comes from
Russian Revolution, 1917.

91
00:06:23,801 --> 00:06:25,441
Why is he quoting the Russian Revolution?

92
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:28,764
I can't think of any good reason.
Maybe ask Kovar when I talk to him.

93
00:06:28,973 --> 00:06:29,974
What?

94
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,351
You can't meet with Kovar.

95
00:06:32,643 --> 00:06:35,020
Kovar had deal with Gregor.
Gregor is dead.

96
00:06:35,271 --> 00:06:39,108
As new Pakhan, I have to meet with him,
he will suspect something is up.

97
00:06:41,402 --> 00:06:43,779
- I could try to talk to Galina.
- To who?

98
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:46,323
- I told you about Taiana.
- Oh, yes.

99
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:50,578
Galina is her mother
and she works for Kovar.

100
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:53,038
Maybe she heard something.

101
00:07:12,558 --> 00:07:13,559
Oh!

102
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:20,524
Your boss, you work for Konstantin Kovar?

103
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:24,403
- He said you were enemy.
- No, no.

104
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:26,405
- A bad man.
- No, no, no.

105
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:29,074
I'm friends with Taiana.

106
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:31,035
My precious Taiana?

107
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:34,163
Well, we're friends.
And I could use your help.

108
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:36,206
- With some things...
- Mmm-hmm.

109
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,953
Wait, I'm not gonna hurt you,
I'm not gonna hurt you. Listen to me.

110
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,122
When Kovar hears about this,
you cannot say you saw me,

111
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:01,273
do you understand?
You say you saw me, he'll hurt you.

112
00:08:01,607 --> 00:08:03,609
All right? All right.

113
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:07,404
My father once told me,

114
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:09,948
"Do not have 100 rubles,

115
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:12,326
"but have 100 friends."

116
00:08:13,786 --> 00:08:16,789
Fortunately for us,
we have both friends and money.

117
00:08:17,081 --> 00:08:22,086
Yes, I assume your presence here means
that our arrangement has borne fruit?

118
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,255
The shipment was routed to this location.

119
00:08:25,673 --> 00:08:28,676
The BIC codes are inside.
All you have to do is retrieve it.

120
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,638
And as for my compensation,
I think that...

121
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:35,683
Unidac Industries, yes.

122
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:39,978
I will make sure you get
the information you desire.

123
00:08:40,396 --> 00:08:43,524
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have some other business to attend to.

124
00:08:43,816 --> 00:08:44,858
My apologies.

125
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:51,365
Malcolm Merlyn,
CEO of Merlyn Global Group.

126
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:54,118
Anatoly Knyazev, gangster.

127
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:05,087
You undercut your new station,
Mr. Knyazev.

128
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:09,800
Pakhan of the Solntsevskaya Bratva,
it's...

129
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:11,885
It's no small feat.

130
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:13,929
Nor is samovol'shchina.

131
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:17,307
One of Gregor's last words.

132
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,184
And, uh...

133
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:25,232
Were his other last words
about who killed him?

134
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:28,485
He called the man Kapiushon.

135
00:09:28,652 --> 00:09:29,778
- Hood.
- Da.

136
00:09:30,154 --> 00:09:32,823
The reports of man with a bow and arrow

137
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,826
are disrupting business,
Bratva and otherwise.

138
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:41,331
It's interesting.
I heard some reports of my own...

139
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:45,794
Of you having trouble with Gregor
because of his deal with me.

140
00:09:46,462 --> 00:09:48,130
I questioned it, yes.

141
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:50,841
Now that I am Pakhan,

142
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:55,512
I'm obligated to live up to commitments
that he made.

143
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:58,015
Such as samovol'shchina?

144
00:09:58,766 --> 00:10:00,726
You study history, Mr. Knyazev?

145
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:04,021
When the Soviet Union was dissolved,

146
00:10:04,188 --> 00:10:07,524
many thought that
the capitalist opportunities will

147
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:10,360
give rise to a more stronger,

148
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:12,696
a more united Russian people.

149
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:17,034
But then powerful men at the KGB,
Communist Party,

150
00:10:17,201 --> 00:10:21,038
the Komsomol, they decided to
cash in on their privileges.

151
00:10:21,205 --> 00:10:22,706
And, uh...

152
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,377
Russia became not stronger,

153
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:30,547
but diseased.

154
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:35,344
And samovol'shchina was the cure once.

155
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:40,057
It could be so again.

156
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:46,021
Right, what does that mean?

157
00:10:46,188 --> 00:10:50,275
It means Kovar is planning something
very big and very terrible.

158
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:52,194
What is he gonna do?

159
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:58,033
Oliver, maybe time is best
for you to go back to America.

160
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,326
Anatoly.

161
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,286
We're brothers.

162
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:03,956
What's happening to you
is happening to me.

163
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:11,421
Kovar is going to overthrow
Russian government.

164
00:11:12,256 --> 00:11:13,757
Samovol'shchina is coup.

165
00:11:13,966 --> 00:11:15,759
And, I mean, he just told you this?

166
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:19,429
Before I got there, he was making deal
with American businessman.

167
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:22,099
Some secret, sensitive shipment.

168
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:23,517
Do you think it's a weapon?

169
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:26,562
Kovar has many men,
but not enough for a coup.

170
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:28,480
But with weapon...

171
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:31,775
Luckily, I got a chance to see
the file they're working on,

172
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:34,862
Orekhovo-Zuyevo.

173
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,447
It is a shipyard in Moscow.

174
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:40,014
Then we go to the shipyard.
We stop Kovar from retrieving it.

175
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:42,911
Seeing you take bullets out of Gregor,

176
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:44,997
I saw him again.

177
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,041
Face of the monster.

178
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:52,337
This place, it's not good for you, Oliver.
Go home.

179
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:55,173
I didn't save you from Gregor

180
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,010
to stand by while you're murdered
by Kovar.

181
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:01,054
This isn't over for me.

182
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:05,684
So be it, brother.

183
00:12:28,624 --> 00:12:29,791
Do they look familiar?

184
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:33,754
Do you even remember their faces?

185
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:36,840
These are your victims.

186
00:12:37,716 --> 00:12:42,054
They were people who did terrible things.

187
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:44,890
They had victims.

188
00:12:45,057 --> 00:12:47,684
And husbands. And wives.

189
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:48,936
Daughters.

190
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:50,979
Sons.

191
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:55,734
Confess your secret, Oliver,
and all of this ends.

192
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:00,197
I'll give you a gift, and you can walk out
that door and go back home.

193
00:13:00,364 --> 00:13:01,907
Adrian, you're sick

194
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:05,369
and you're a hypocrite.

195
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:09,539
There is nothing that I've done
that compares with you.

196
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,709
Murdered your own wife...

197
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,297
Cecil Adams.

198
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:22,344
You knew him by his street name,
The Count.

199
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:25,681
You put three arrows in him.

200
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:27,724
He was gonna kill a friend of mine.

201
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:30,477
Felicity Smoak, yeah.

202
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:36,066
Confess or you get the same three arrows.

203
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,074
Go to hell.

204
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:46,076
I've already been there, Oliver.

205
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,662
And I've come back with a message for you.

206
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:06,930
- Are we all clear?
- Clear.

207
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:12,769
See how easy it is to think first,
and kill people later?

208
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,544
What is that?

209
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:40,589
Sarin gas. Enough to kill thousands.

210
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:52,142
What's next?

211
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:55,062
You said something
when I brought you here.

212
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,355
About how your friends are your strength.

213
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:58,690
Now...

214
00:15:00,484 --> 00:15:02,652
She didn't even know
I was in her apartment.

215
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:07,074
Oh, I swear to God, if you hurt her...

216
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:08,825
You'll do absolutely nothing.

217
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:10,702
Because you're here.

218
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:14,748
You see, until you confess
your secret, Oliver,

219
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,834
everyone that you love is at play.

220
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:20,378
Even your son.

221
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:26,676
You're bluffing.

222
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:29,179
He's in hiding.

223
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:31,088
I don't even know where he is.

224
00:15:31,223 --> 00:15:32,849
Because you haven't really looked.

225
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:36,520
But for me,
we both know it's just a matter of time.

226
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:39,356
Confess.

227
00:15:41,233 --> 00:15:43,193
I don't know what you want me to say.

228
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:47,280
Then I guess I should leave you here
to think about it.

229
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,324
And wonder who I might Kill
while I'm gone.

230
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:51,451
Adrian! Adrian, please!

231
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:54,746
All you have to do is say the words.

232
00:16:00,085 --> 00:16:01,419
That's what I thought.

233
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:03,547
See you soon.

234
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,601
We have incoming.

235
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:35,805
The truck!

236
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:37,807
Kovar has the Sarin gas.

237
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:42,187
Then we are all going to be dead men.

238
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:56,159
- How's Anatoly?
- Recovering.

239
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,453
Which is more than I can say for our men.

240
00:17:58,787 --> 00:18:00,664
- The sarin gas get him?
- Da.

241
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:02,707
Where were you?

242
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:06,086
I was keeping Overwatch,
like Anatoly ordered.

243
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:11,174
You have something to say to me, Viktor,
So just say it.

244
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,760
It was your idea to go against Gregor.

245
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:16,513
Because of Kovar,
with your vendetta against him.

246
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,320
- Now look at the mess we're in.
- Well, do you have a better idea?

247
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:22,435
We should be honoring Gregor's pact
with Kovar. Not this.

248
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:25,105
The moment that Kovar
overthrows the government,

249
00:18:25,272 --> 00:18:27,190
he is going to wipe out the entire Bratva.

250
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:30,485
Where are you going?

251
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:32,612
We have one of Kovar's men

252
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:35,365
and we need to know
where the gas is gonna be used.

253
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:38,118
Why would he tell you anything?

254
00:18:41,705 --> 00:18:43,081
He won't be talking to me.

255
00:18:48,712 --> 00:18:52,424
Please, I don't know anything.
There's no need to hurt me.

256
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,051
Quiet.

257
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,561
A friend of mine recently showed me
the skinning technique

258
00:19:04,728 --> 00:19:06,271
used by hunters of Mongolia.

259
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:11,568
They remove all the skin
of things much larger than you

260
00:19:11,735 --> 00:19:13,403
in less than five minutes.

261
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:15,530
Which means,

262
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:18,283
you don't have very long

263
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:21,703
to tell me what your boss is planning.

264
00:19:22,537 --> 00:19:26,082
I don't know anything.

265
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,085
I was kind of hoping you would say that.

266
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,346
What is this monstrosity?

267
00:19:39,763 --> 00:19:40,930
You should be resting.

268
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:43,892
I woke up with headache.
I came to find you,

269
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,602
I was not expecting this.

270
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:48,396
This is not human.

271
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:50,357
Anatoly, I told you.

272
00:19:51,274 --> 00:19:52,776
Putting on this hood,

273
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:55,111
it helps me direct
the darkness inside of me.

274
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,114
And it worked, by the way.

275
00:19:58,531 --> 00:19:59,991
I know what Kovar is planning.

276
00:20:00,158 --> 00:20:01,826
But at what cost?

277
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:06,915
You're a fool to think a piece of cloth
can separate man from monster.

278
00:20:07,582 --> 00:20:09,209
Dividing yourself in two

279
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:14,381
will only make monster stronger,
until it is stronger than you.

280
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:18,468
You knew what I was capable of
back on Lian Yu.

281
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:22,055
Yeah.

282
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:27,227
But this man I see now

283
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:32,148
bears more resemblance to Slade Wilson
or Anthony Ivo.

284
00:20:39,322 --> 00:20:40,490
Tough man.

285
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:43,868
Clearly withstood a lot before breaking.

286
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:46,788
He gave up pretty quickly.

287
00:20:48,123 --> 00:20:49,958
The rest was me practicing.

288
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:52,752
Practicing to become what?

289
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:55,880
Something else.

290
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:03,221
Kovar's inviting key members
of the government,

291
00:21:03,346 --> 00:21:06,224
politicians and military mostly,
to the opening of his casino.

292
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,726
And kill them with sarin gas,
even the innocents?

293
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:10,015
It's not good for business.

294
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:14,274
Yes, but being in charge of whole country
is good for business.

295
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:15,942
We need to get into that casino,

296
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:18,194
and we need to stop the attack
before it happens.

297
00:21:18,361 --> 00:21:19,529
Place will be fortress,

298
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:22,657
increased security
for president and generals.

299
00:21:23,241 --> 00:21:24,367
Impossible to break in.

300
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:26,161
Then what do you suggest we do?

301
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:27,954
We sneak in.

302
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:29,921
Without the help of someone
working for Kovar?

303
00:21:30,081 --> 00:21:31,207
I know someone.

304
00:21:31,374 --> 00:21:33,054
Well, if you're thinking about house lady,

305
00:21:33,084 --> 00:21:34,364
last time it did not go so well.

306
00:21:34,461 --> 00:21:36,004
Give me a second chance.

307
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:39,507
And if second chance doesn't work?

308
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:48,641
Mrs. Venediktov?

309
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:54,814
He's fine.

310
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:56,733
Well, he's unconscious, but... Look,

311
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:59,194
I'm sorry that I scared you
the other night.

312
00:21:59,402 --> 00:22:01,571
I just, I need to speak with you. I...

313
00:22:01,863 --> 00:22:05,909
Well, it's like I said,
I knew your children Taiana and Vlad.

314
00:22:08,203 --> 00:22:09,829
Do you know what happened to them?

315
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:15,585
I'm sorry. They're dead.

316
00:22:17,712 --> 00:22:20,757
But Mr. Kovar say
he's still looking for them.

317
00:22:20,924 --> 00:22:21,925
Kovar is lying.

318
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:23,635
Before she died, Taiana,

319
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:26,513
she told me that he was a monster.

320
00:22:26,638 --> 00:22:29,974
And she made me promise, she made me swear

321
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:32,352
that I would bring him to justice.

322
00:22:34,145 --> 00:22:37,982
But even what you say is true,
what can I do?

323
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:39,984
Taiana told me that...

324
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:45,657
"The same hammer that shatters glass,

325
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:46,824
"forges steel."

326
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:50,286
I say to her as a child
to make her grow up strong.

327
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:51,454
Well, she did.

328
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:56,376
And she helped me grow strong, too.

329
00:22:58,127 --> 00:22:59,629
Would you please,

330
00:23:00,463 --> 00:23:02,924
please help me keep my promise to her?

331
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:13,768
This gets me into Mr. Kovar's buildings.

332
00:23:14,352 --> 00:23:15,436
Thank you.

333
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:17,313
Make it right for them.

334
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:21,526
Uh...

335
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:22,652
Tell me,

336
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:26,656
who killed my children?

337
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:30,827
A monster.

338
00:23:50,305 --> 00:23:51,889
What did you do to her?

339
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:57,020
I made her more compliant.

340
00:24:02,525 --> 00:24:03,860
Get up.

341
00:24:04,027 --> 00:24:05,945
Give yourself a chance.

342
00:24:14,746 --> 00:24:15,872
I'm...

343
00:24:16,664 --> 00:24:18,207
I'm not gonna fight her.

344
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:20,126
I don't want you to fight her.

345
00:24:20,293 --> 00:24:21,878
I want you to kill her.

346
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:23,588
I'm gonna leave now.

347
00:24:23,755 --> 00:24:27,091
When I come back,
either she's killed you and I let her go,

348
00:24:27,258 --> 00:24:29,510
or you Kill her and I let you go.

349
00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:33,222
No. Neither one of those things
is gonna happen.

350
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:36,351
If you don't kill her,
you're gonna watch me snap her neck.

351
00:24:36,517 --> 00:24:40,188
Adrian, what is the point of this?

352
00:24:40,438 --> 00:24:45,276
You seem to be having a little bit of
trouble figuring out what your secret is.

353
00:24:45,443 --> 00:24:46,861
I thought this might remind you.

354
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:49,405
Good luck.

355
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,748
I'm sorry, Oliver.

356
00:25:00,917 --> 00:25:03,127
I can't take another day in here.

357
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:45,294
I think it's a...

358
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:20,955
Canisters are in a storeroom.

359
00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:22,457
Southwest corner. Second floor.

360
00:26:22,665 --> 00:26:23,875
Copy that.

361
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,960
Okay, if you'd be so kind
to let us in now, please?

362
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:33,676
- I'll meet you at the target.
- Da.

363
00:26:45,021 --> 00:26:46,522
I took you into my home.

364
00:26:48,024 --> 00:26:51,068
I gave you food and shelter.
This is how you repay me?

365
00:27:06,876 --> 00:27:07,877
Now where?

366
00:27:08,044 --> 00:27:10,421
I studied the map.
I know a shortcut. Here.

367
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:13,758
Are you sure this is the way?

368
00:27:14,008 --> 00:27:16,928
Almost there.
Should be at the turn up ahead.

369
00:27:25,061 --> 00:27:26,646
You sold us out.

370
00:27:28,022 --> 00:27:30,066
We're in a casino, Anatoly.

371
00:27:31,025 --> 00:27:33,986
I like to think of it as
playing the hand I was dealt.

372
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:07,186
Evelyn? Hey, look at me, listen to me.

373
00:28:07,854 --> 00:28:10,481
I need you to bring the knife over here.

374
00:28:11,065 --> 00:28:13,943
I want you to get me out of these things.

375
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:17,989
When he comes back...

376
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:19,866
We will ambush him.

377
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:23,828
No, we can't beat him.

378
00:28:24,787 --> 00:28:27,832
I didn't know what I was buying into
when I sided with him. I...

379
00:28:27,999 --> 00:28:31,168
It's okay. I forgive you. I, uh...

380
00:28:32,295 --> 00:28:34,797
I just, I think that together,
we can get through this.

381
00:28:35,256 --> 00:28:36,465
I'm dead.

382
00:28:37,842 --> 00:28:41,012
That's all he kept telling me. I'm dead

383
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:43,639
because I was a part of your life.

384
00:28:49,854 --> 00:28:51,355
Will you bring me the knife?

385
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,984
Will you bring me the knife,
and I can save us?

386
00:28:57,528 --> 00:28:58,613
No!

387
00:29:01,324 --> 00:29:02,867
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

388
00:29:09,332 --> 00:29:11,000
Oh, my God!

389
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:13,127
Come on!

390
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:14,837
Are we serious?

391
00:29:15,129 --> 00:29:17,381
Oliver, what are you trying to prove, man?

392
00:29:17,548 --> 00:29:19,800
Evelyn betrayed you,
you've Killed people for less.

393
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:23,429
I'm not gonna Kill her,
I won't, just let her go.

394
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:25,949
You're forgetting what I told you

395
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:28,225
- would happen if you didn't kill her.
- No!

396
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:31,020
- No!
- Adrian, will you please, okay?

397
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,064
You have made your point.

398
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:35,399
Confess, Oliver. Tell me your secret.

399
00:29:35,608 --> 00:29:38,903
I don't know what you want from me!

400
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,464
I want you to tell me what you've been

401
00:29:40,488 --> 00:29:43,366
too afraid to tell your sister,
Felicity, Diggle.

402
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:44,909
Tell me!

403
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:50,414
I don't know! I don't.

404
00:29:51,874 --> 00:29:53,709
Wrong answer.

405
00:30:10,434 --> 00:30:13,354
- I'm gonna kill you.
- Finally, we're getting somewhere.

406
00:30:15,064 --> 00:30:16,065
Confess.

407
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,656
Oliver, we've been betrayed! Viktor, he...

408
00:30:33,207 --> 00:30:35,584
I'm so very proud of this casino,

409
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:38,170
and what it means for our country.

410
00:30:39,255 --> 00:30:41,465
Well, that's why it saddens me
to tell you that

411
00:30:41,632 --> 00:30:45,052
there was an attempt
by Solntsevskaya Bratva

412
00:30:45,219 --> 00:30:47,304
to crash these festivities,

413
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:51,600
and assassinate every one of these
government officials here tonight.

414
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:53,310
But don't worry,

415
00:30:53,477 --> 00:30:54,812
we have them all in custody.

416
00:31:00,151 --> 00:31:01,193
Yes.

417
00:31:06,949 --> 00:31:10,953
I'm told they planned
to stage a gas attack

418
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,288
in this very room.

419
00:31:15,249 --> 00:31:20,171
But, uh, sadly for them, even though they
were successful in launching the attack...

420
00:31:22,048 --> 00:31:23,758
It backfired and

421
00:31:24,425 --> 00:31:27,303
killed every single one of them.

422
00:31:27,678 --> 00:31:29,221
Well, at least,

423
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:33,642
that's what the newspapers
will report in the morning.

424
00:31:36,437 --> 00:31:37,480
Good evening.

425
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:45,738
Confess.

426
00:31:46,697 --> 00:31:49,617
You killed my father
because he was a name on a list.

427
00:31:49,784 --> 00:31:52,161
But that's not really true, is it? No.

428
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:11,263
It's too late, Kapiushon.

429
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,307
The gas has only done its work.

430
00:32:14,016 --> 00:32:15,851
The list was just an excuse.

431
00:32:16,143 --> 00:32:17,895
The hood, the disguise, just an excuse.

432
00:32:18,104 --> 00:32:21,774
The idea that all of this is
some heroic crusade, is just an excuse.

433
00:32:21,941 --> 00:32:23,526
Excuse for what?

434
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:26,821
- Huh? Tell me!
- You tell me, Oliver.

435
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:28,697
You tell me.

436
00:32:31,075 --> 00:32:32,076
Kill him.

437
00:32:46,549 --> 00:32:47,842
Oliver Queen.

438
00:32:48,175 --> 00:32:50,427
Who could have imagined?

439
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,853
I know what's going on
through your mind, Oliver.

440
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:01,939
You're thinking that you can get
yourself free from those chains,

441
00:33:02,148 --> 00:33:05,359
lay me to the ground and snap my neck,
just like I did to Evelyn.

442
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:08,487
There it is.

443
00:33:08,696 --> 00:33:10,739
There's the look I've been waiting to see.

444
00:33:11,282 --> 00:33:12,926
But it's not just about stopping me,
is it?

445
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:15,369
No, there's something else in there.

446
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:17,204
Confess, Oliver.

447
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:22,334
When you see Taiana in the afterlife...

448
00:33:23,878 --> 00:33:25,462
Give her a kiss for me.

449
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:46,817
- I'm going to finish this.
- No!

450
00:33:47,109 --> 00:33:50,446
Are you going to let your Pakhan finish it
for you, Mr. Queen?

451
00:33:50,613 --> 00:33:51,973
You don't have to do this, Oliver.

452
00:33:52,072 --> 00:33:53,657
We both know that I do.

453
00:34:33,322 --> 00:34:36,325
You don't have to, Oliver.
The man will face justice, I promise.

454
00:34:37,076 --> 00:34:40,537
You're right.
He'll face justice.

455
00:34:51,674 --> 00:34:54,510
You've told yourself you kill
because you have to.

456
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:57,596
Confess, Oliver.

457
00:34:58,013 --> 00:35:00,724
You don't kill because you have to.
So, why...

458
00:35:01,517 --> 00:35:03,769
- Why do you do it?
- Because I wanted to.

459
00:35:05,187 --> 00:35:06,313
What?

460
00:35:06,689 --> 00:35:07,815
I wanted to.

461
00:35:08,482 --> 00:35:10,818
I wanted to!

462
00:35:10,985 --> 00:35:12,736
And I liked it!

463
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:25,291
How's it feel?

464
00:35:25,958 --> 00:35:29,712
Knowing that I saw the one thing
you couldn't admit to yourself?

465
00:35:30,421 --> 00:35:31,714
I knew he'd break.

466
00:35:37,553 --> 00:35:39,346
Just like you said he would.

467
00:35:39,513 --> 00:35:42,725
It's because I know him
better than he even knows himself.

468
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:44,727
Give us a moment alone, would you?

469
00:35:55,738 --> 00:35:59,241
I told you, Oliver.
You infect every life you touch.

470
00:36:00,242 --> 00:36:02,161
Now do you realize why?

471
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:07,249
It's because your crusade
was based on a lie.

472
00:36:09,168 --> 00:36:12,671
You used your father's memory
to justify a killing spree.

473
00:36:15,257 --> 00:36:18,135
There's a price to be paid
for that, Oliver.

474
00:36:18,761 --> 00:36:20,429
Your mother paid it.

475
00:36:21,055 --> 00:36:23,891
Your friend Tommy paid it. Laurel.

476
00:36:24,266 --> 00:36:27,019
Do you really want to tell me
that John Diggle and Felicity Smoak's

477
00:36:27,186 --> 00:36:29,605
lives are better having known you?

478
00:36:31,231 --> 00:36:34,902
You promised to let me go.

479
00:36:35,069 --> 00:36:37,321
And I'm a man of my word.

480
00:36:37,488 --> 00:36:39,448
But first, I have a gift for you.

481
00:36:45,037 --> 00:36:46,663
This tattoo of yours.

482
00:36:47,873 --> 00:36:52,419
To be an American
and named a Captain in the Bratva,

483
00:36:53,462 --> 00:36:55,798
you must have done
something extraordinary.

484
00:36:56,215 --> 00:36:58,050
When you look at it, it must...

485
00:36:58,342 --> 00:37:00,886
It must remind you of such a victory.

486
00:37:05,391 --> 00:37:07,768
Now when you look at it,

487
00:37:07,935 --> 00:37:10,437
you'll think about our time here together.

488
00:37:11,021 --> 00:37:13,982
And the secret that you confessed to me.

489
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:16,485
Whatever pain I caused you...

490
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:22,324
I'm sorry.

491
00:37:22,491 --> 00:37:24,535
I believe you, Oliver.

492
00:37:25,661 --> 00:37:27,329
I just don't care.

493
00:37:40,509 --> 00:37:41,844
You know, I've decided.

494
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:43,178
You are my favorite American.

495
00:37:43,345 --> 00:37:44,847
How many Americans do you know?

496
00:37:45,097 --> 00:37:48,392
You and joking are not exactly
made for each other.

497
00:37:49,268 --> 00:37:50,686
But that looks like it does.

498
00:37:50,978 --> 00:37:53,188
Anatoly, why make me a Captain?

499
00:37:53,564 --> 00:37:54,731
I'm not staying in Russia.

500
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:57,192
Because now anywhere you go in the world,

501
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,070
any Bratva you meet will know
what kind of man you are.

502
00:38:01,363 --> 00:38:03,365
Come, I have another gift for you.

503
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:08,954
Here,

504
00:38:10,122 --> 00:38:12,458
I recovered it from the casino.

505
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,044
Thank you.

506
00:38:17,004 --> 00:38:19,923
You remember the first time
we met on Amazo?

507
00:38:21,842 --> 00:38:24,094
I was performing surgery on myself.

508
00:38:24,303 --> 00:38:25,846
That's kind of difficult to forget.

509
00:38:26,013 --> 00:38:27,890
Yeah. What was it I said to you then?

510
00:38:28,474 --> 00:38:29,634
"Living is not for the weak."

511
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:33,312
I cannot believe scared boy
in cell beside me

512
00:38:33,479 --> 00:38:35,397
would be one to kill Konstantin Kovar.

513
00:38:35,564 --> 00:38:37,357
Well, that wasn't me.

514
00:38:38,901 --> 00:38:41,361
- That was him.
- That is a lie you tell yourself.

515
00:38:42,279 --> 00:38:44,281
An excuse that allows you to Kill.

516
00:38:45,741 --> 00:38:47,242
But you kill because you like it.

517
00:38:47,409 --> 00:38:49,828
That's not true, Anatoly, I hate it.

518
00:38:50,454 --> 00:38:52,534
And I think maybe you've had
a bit too much to drink.

519
00:38:52,581 --> 00:38:54,750
Well, that is entirely possible.

520
00:38:54,917 --> 00:38:57,002
But in this case, I am right.

521
00:38:57,169 --> 00:39:00,380
This deal you've sold yourself on,

522
00:39:00,547 --> 00:39:05,177
like this hood is going to keep
this monster of yours at bay?

523
00:39:06,637 --> 00:39:08,889
Someday it's going to fall apart.

524
00:39:09,598 --> 00:39:11,308
And when it does,

525
00:39:11,475 --> 00:39:14,770
you're not going to like the man
you see underneath.

526
00:39:21,443 --> 00:39:23,195
Well?

527
00:39:23,362 --> 00:39:27,032
It will take weeks
until he's back on his feet.

528
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:31,036
But he'll live. He gives you his thanks.

529
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:33,455
Just out of morbid curiosity,

530
00:39:34,164 --> 00:39:35,457
who did this to him?

531
00:39:36,083 --> 00:39:37,834
That's his business.

532
00:39:38,919 --> 00:39:41,797
Well, whoever it is,

533
00:39:41,964 --> 00:39:43,757
I'm glad I'm not him.

534
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,762
- How much longer?
- "How much longer?"

535
00:40:30,971 --> 00:40:33,324
We've literally had to re-route
the electro-optical digital imaging

536
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:35,493
from every reconnaissance satellite
I could gain access to.

537
00:40:35,517 --> 00:40:38,562
Then we had to capture data
in a four-dimensional array

538
00:40:38,729 --> 00:40:41,398
which could then be parsed
using a real-time algorithm.

539
00:40:41,565 --> 00:40:44,192
Basically, solving cold fusion
would have been easier.

540
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:45,360
Okay, I'm sorry.

541
00:40:45,527 --> 00:40:47,380
Just been at this so long
I don't know which way is up.

542
00:40:47,404 --> 00:40:49,364
And Oliver's been gone for six days and...

543
00:40:49,531 --> 00:40:51,033
And, and what?

544
00:40:52,326 --> 00:40:54,620
- Oliver? Oh, my God!
- Oliver?

545
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:03,128
Chase had me.

546
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:08,383
And he let me go.

547
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:14,514
Go slow, man.

548
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:18,685
It's over.

549
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:22,194
Oliver, we're gonna get this
son of a bitch for whatever he did to you.

550
00:41:24,066 --> 00:41:25,525
John, it's...

551
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:31,073
It's over for me.

552
00:41:33,492 --> 00:41:35,744
I don't wanna do this anymore.

553
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:41,249
I'm shutting everything down.

554
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:26,878
