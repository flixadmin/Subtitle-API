cut my guts from my belly

what happens to them?

What he did?

332
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:13,752
Don't worry.

333
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,837
The North remembers.

334
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:19,007
I punished him for it.

335
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,927
He's not ironborn anymore.

336
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:25,222
Not Theon Greyjoy anymore.

337
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:27,099
He's a new man.

338
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:30,686
A new person, anyway.

339
00:29:31,353 --> 00:29:32,396
Aren't you, Reek?

340
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:35,023
Yes, master.

341
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:37,025
That's his new name, Reek.

342
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,111
Why are you doing this?

343
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:44,199
Because Reek has something to say to you.

344
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:45,867
Don't you, Reek?

345
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:58,046
An apology?

346
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:06,680
Apologize to Lady Sansa
for what you did.

347
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:11,226
Apologize for murdering her two brothers.

348
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:18,483
I'm sorry.

349
00:30:20,277 --> 00:30:21,987
Look at her, Reek.

350
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:27,451
An apology doesn't mean anything
if you're not looking the person in the eye.

351
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:36,877
- I'm sorry.
- RAMSAY: Sorry about what?

352
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:39,671
For killing your brothers.

353
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:53,852
There, over and done with.

354
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:56,563
- Doesn't everyone feel better? I do.

Whew.

357
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,115
You know what, my lady?

358
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:11,078
What with him having murdered your brothers

359
00:31:11,328 --> 00:31:13,455
and the rest of your family gone,

360
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:20,045
Reek here is the nearest thing to living kin

361
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:22,005
that you have left.

362
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:23,757
Reek.

363
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,968
You will give away the bride.

364
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:33,558
Someone has to. What better person?

365
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:34,935
Good?
Good?

366
00:31:36,103 --> 00:31:38,313
Yes, yes, very good.

367
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:39,981
Wonderful.

368
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:45,695
Walda and I have some good news as well,
since we're all together.

369
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:53,412
We're going to have a baby.

370
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:01,753
I'm very happy for you.

371
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:06,258
From the way she's carrying,
Maester Wolkan says it looks like a boy.

372
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:23,567
RAMSAY: How can you be sure?

373
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:25,861
Sure of what?

374
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,279
That she's pregnant.

375
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:29,448
I mean...

376
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,533
How can you tell?

377
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:34,327
Maester Wolkan
has assured us beyond all doubt.

378
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:46,631
So, how did you manage it?

379
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:48,300
Manage what?

380
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:49,676
Getting her pregnant.

381
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:52,804
I imagine you're familiar with the procedure.

382
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:57,058
Of course, but how did you find it?

383
00:32:57,142 --> 00:32:59,352
You disgraced yourself at dinner,

384
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:02,230
parading that creature before the Stark girl.

385
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:03,732
- And if it's a boy?
- (CHUCKLES)

386
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:08,653
You're worried about your position.

387
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:10,739
My position is quite clear.

388
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:12,741
I'm your son

389
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:16,369
until a better alternative comes along.

390
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:27,005
You've never asked me about your mother.

391
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:34,054
Why would I?

392
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:37,432
She had me, she died.

393
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:40,143
And here we are.

394
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,188
BOLTON: She was a peasant girl.

395
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:45,982
Pretty in a common sort of way.

396
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:48,109
She was the miller's wife.

397
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:52,489
Apparently they had married
without my knowledge or consent,

398
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:53,907
so I had him hanged,

399
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:57,619
and I took her
beneath the tree where he was swaying.

400
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,329
She fought me the whole time.

401
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:01,623
She was lucky I didn't hang her, too.

402
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:06,378
A year later she came to my gates
with a squalling baby in her arms.

403
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:08,547
A baby she claimed was mine.

404
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:10,549
I nearly had her whipped,

405
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:12,634
and the child thrown in the river.

406
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:19,724
But then I looked at you,

407
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:22,561
and I saw then what I see now.

408
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:24,646
You are my son.

409
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:40,245
Stannis Baratheon
has an army at Castle Black,

410
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,497
but he won't stay for long.

411
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:46,209
He wants the Iron Throne,

412
00:34:46,293 --> 00:34:49,671
and the road to King's Landing
comes right through Winterfell.

413
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:52,340
He means to take the North.

414
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,178
But the North is ours.

415
00:34:57,554 --> 00:34:59,014
It's yours and mine.

416
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:02,434
Will you help me defeat him?

417
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:05,937
Yes.

418
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:16,698
Is this every book there is?

419
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:19,701
Every book there is?

420
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:22,037
In the world.

421
00:35:22,746 --> 00:35:23,830
Well, no.

422
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:27,709
There are thousands
and thousands of books out there.

423
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:29,628
This library is rather small, actually.

424
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:31,671
Where you grew up, were there more books?

425
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:34,341
My father's not the most literate man.

426
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:40,639
They say the Citadel
has the largest library in the world.

427
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:41,890
Where's that?

428
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:44,517
The Citadel?

429
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:47,312
In Oldtown.

430
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,029
I'm sorry I don't know things.

431
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:58,782
Oh, Gilly, look at me.

432
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:02,452
You know how to do
a hundred things I can never do.

433
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:04,871
You can build a fire with wet wood.

434
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:07,457
You can cook. You can stitch a wound.

435
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:10,251
I can wash the linens. I can sweep the floor.

436
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:11,336
Well...

437
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:13,755
Why does the Citadel
have the biggest library?

438
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,549
It's where they train the maesters.

439
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:18,677
Like Maester Aemon?

440
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,012
I wanted to be one when I was young.

441
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:28,061
Instead, I became a man of the Night's Watch.

442
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:33,233
Far more adventure up here anyway.

443
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:36,945

Defeated my brother at the Battle of Ashford.

450
00:37:06,975 --> 00:37:09,185
Only battle Robert ever lost.

451
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:11,771
I told him he shouldn't go
so far west so soon,

452

but he never listened.

Fine soldier, your father.

454
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:20,572
You don't look like a soldier.

455
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:24,576
But I'm told you killed a White Walker.

456
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:26,828
I did, Your Grace.

457
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:27,996
How?

458
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,998
With a dagger made of dragonglass.

459
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:31,332
Dragonglass?

460
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:32,584
What the maesters call obsidian.

461
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:35,462
I know what it is. We have it in Dragonstone.

462
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:37,422
Why would obsidian kill a Walker?

463
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:39,132
I don't know.

464
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:40,759
I've been going through
all the old manuscripts

465
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:42,093
hoping to find something,

466
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:43,261
and all I've learned

467
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:46,473
is that the Children of the Forest
used to hunt with dragonglass.

468
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:50,101
The Lady Melisandre told me
that death marches on the Wall.

469
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:54,856
I've seen it, Your Grace.

470
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,983
Seen what?

471
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,860
The army of the dead.

472
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,029
And when they come...

473
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,239
We have to know how to fight them.

474
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:08,953
Keep reading, Samwell Tarly.

475
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:28,890
It's time.

476
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:31,392
Uh, Your Grace.

477
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,812
Wouldn't it be better to wait?

478
00:38:33,895 --> 00:38:37,023
When Jon Snow returns with the wildlings,
we could have thousands more men.

479
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:40,151
If Jon Snow returns with the wildlings.
We can't wait that long.

480
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:43,905
We have the advantage,
more men, more horses, all fed and rested.

481
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,950
But every day we wait,
the odds shift in Bolton's favor.

482
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:49,035
This could turn to winter at any moment.

483
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:52,205
We have to act now. Give the order.
We march at sunrise.

484
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:56,626
I'll choose a dozen men to stay
and guard the queen and the princess.

485
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:58,127
No need. They're coming with us.

486
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:02,507
It's a tough road ahead,
Your Grace.

- Won't they be safer...
- Here?

488
00:39:05,552 --> 00:39:09,097
Half these Watchmen are killers and rapists.

489
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,558
No, they march with us.

00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:48,553

496
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:52,390
All the kings in the North are buried there.
Bran the Builder, and King Dorren, and...

First things first. It's a long march ahead.

498
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:56,978
And then we have to take the castle.

499
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,438
Is there going to be a battle?

500
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:00,899
Aye, princess,
but you won't be anywhere near...

501
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:03,276
That's enough talk of battle,

502

504
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,243
I'm not scared.

I hope you know
what you're doing with these wildlings.

509

I need those ships.

I failed my men.

I failed my queen.

You failed no one.

527
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:53,905
You fought bravely.

You were ambushed, outnumbered.

531
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:07,585
There was no way you could have known.

532
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:09,670
This is not why.

there is no shame for this.

I am ashamed

536
00:43:20,181 --> 00:43:22,934
because when the knife go in

537
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:25,019
and I fall to the ground,

538
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:27,939
I am afraid.

539
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,609
All men fear death.

540
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:34,362
No, not death.

I fear

542
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:45,081
I never again see Missandei
from the Island of Naath.

543
00:44:21,117 --> 00:44:23,911
Now you have given the Masters
what they deserve.

544
00:44:23,995 --> 00:44:27,331
If I give everyone what they deserve,
I'll have no one left to rule.

right up to the morning he died.

547
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:35,882
Daario Naharis thinks
I should kill the former Masters,

548
00:44:35,965 --> 00:44:38,092
and let the rest of the city fend for itself.

an opinion on these matters.

You are as fit as anyone I know.

and who will suffer the most
if this all falls apart.

I can only tell you what I have seen,

556
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:08,748
I have seen you listen to your counselors.

557
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:14,003
I have seen you lean on their experience
when your own was lacking,

558
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:17,423
and weigh the choices they put before you.

559
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:21,093
And I have seen you ignore your counselors

560
00:45:24,597 --> 00:45:27,266
because there was a better choice.

561
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:29,352
One that only you could see.

My queen,
please do not do this.

563
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:51,749
What about "Valar Morghulis"?

564
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:54,293
I did not want to die a coward.

565
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:01,926
Apparently I do not want to die at all.
(SNIFFLES)

566
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:06,013
It takes courage to admit fear.

00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:09,684
And to admit a mistake.

568
00:46:11,352 --> 00:46:13,771
I came here to tell you that I was wrong.

569
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:19,277
I was wrong, and you were right.

570
00:46:20,987 --> 00:46:22,989
About tradition.

571
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:27,618
About bringing the people
of this city together.

572
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:32,873
I will reopen the fighting pits.

573
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:35,751
To free men only.

574
00:46:36,085 --> 00:46:39,839
Slavery will never return to Meereen,
not while I live.

575
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:42,133
Yes, my queen.

576
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:49,265
And in order to forge a lasting bond
with the Meereenese people,

577
00:46:49,724 --> 00:46:51,976
I will marry the leader of an ancient family.

578

Thankfully a suitor is already on his knees.

579

Don't worry.

580
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:30,765
I'll be fine. Nothing broken, I don't think.

Long, sullen silences

584
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:48,574
and an occasional punch in the face.

The Mormont way.

586
00:47:56,165 --> 00:47:58,918
Let's start over.

587
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:02,755
I apologize for before.

588
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:05,591
My mouth sometimes runs away from me.

589
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:08,260
This doesn't have to be an unpleasant trip.

590
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:16,727
We're going to be spending
a lot of time together on the way to Meereen.

591

We are.

What would make our time together
truly enjoyable

593
00:48:22,942 --> 00:48:24,318
would be some wine.

594
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:26,654
No wine.

595
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:32,993
I am a person who drinks.

596
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:37,206
People who drink need to keep drinking.

597
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:38,916
Otherwise, they're not...

598
00:48:46,674 --> 00:48:48,092

00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:02,773
I think you'll be plenty.

You know what they say.

What about the demons and the flames?

609

And then they weren't.

00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:09,747
TYRION: So, what now?

661
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:13,667
JORAH: We walk up the coast.
With luck, we'll find a fishing village.

662
00:54:14,585 --> 00:54:15,836
Maybe another boat.

663
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:17,671
Without luck?

664
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:20,632
We've got a long walk ahead of us.

665
00:54:23,177 --> 00:54:25,596
I'll get some wood for a fire.

666
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:27,723
Try to get some rest, huh?

667
00:54:29,183 --> 00:54:31,310
That's the best idea you've had all day.
