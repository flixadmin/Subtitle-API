1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:00:42,944 --> 00:00:47,073
Nowadays, the US
government can listen to anything you say.

3
00:00:47,157 --> 00:00:50,493
They know where you are,
they know who you're talking to,

4
00:00:50,576 --> 00:00:53,955
and trust me,
they know who you're fucking.

5
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:57,792
You turn on a cell phone or a computer,
and you're doomed.

6
00:00:58,584 --> 00:01:03,006
But in Colombia in 1989,
it wasn't that easy.

7
00:01:03,089 --> 00:01:05,300
First off,
there was no Internet.

8
00:01:05,384 --> 00:01:06,801
No cells.

9
00:01:06,885 --> 00:01:08,553
The best they had were satellite phones,

10
00:01:08,636 --> 00:01:12,891
and in order to capture a satellite phone,
you had to fly directly over it.

11
00:01:12,974 --> 00:01:17,270
On top of that, the only people
who had sat phones were the filthy rich...

12
00:01:17,354 --> 00:01:19,731
the landowners, the politicians...

13
00:01:21,107 --> 00:01:24,819
And lucky for us,
the narcos were richer than them all.

14
00:01:28,948 --> 00:01:30,575
What's up, Lizard?

15
00:01:31,743 --> 00:01:33,953
We're going out tonight.

16
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:41,294
And once you got a signal,
you didn't know who you were listening to.

17
00:01:41,378 --> 00:01:44,964
That's why back then, the US government
developed software that could identify

18
00:01:45,048 --> 00:01:47,508
the voices of our targets.

19
00:01:47,592 --> 00:01:51,721
I got Poison at 400 to 1700 megahertz,
gentlemen.

20
00:01:51,804 --> 00:01:54,849
No GPS either.

21
00:01:54,933 --> 00:01:57,310
Hammer, prepare to engage.

22
00:01:57,518 --> 00:02:00,813
Once we got a target,
we still had to locate it.

23
00:02:00,897 --> 00:02:04,650
So we had to triangulate their signals
using assets on the ground.

24
00:02:07,862 --> 00:02:10,407
OK, he's in Modelia.
He's on the west side.

25
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:12,658
Hawkeye, how do you copy that?

26
00:02:12,742 --> 00:02:16,288
Can you be more specific?
Police units are standing by.

27
00:02:16,496 --> 00:02:18,539
La Dispensaria.

28
00:02:19,499 --> 00:02:21,209
I've got a table ready.

29
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,837
Show up around midnight.

30
00:02:25,088 --> 00:02:27,966
- It's gonna be raining women.
- Poison didn't know it,

31
00:02:28,049 --> 00:02:30,260
but he'd just made himself a date.

32
00:02:30,343 --> 00:02:34,264
Negative on Hammer. This fuckwad
just told us where he's going.

33
00:02:34,347 --> 00:02:36,224
Hammer, disengage.

34
00:02:36,308 --> 00:02:38,601
So who do we give this to? DEA?

35
00:02:38,684 --> 00:02:42,188
- Yeah. Let's give it to Javier Peña.
- Peña's an asshole.

36
00:02:42,272 --> 00:02:44,357
- I'm gonna give it to the other guy.
- Sure.

37
00:02:46,818 --> 00:02:48,820
By "the other guy," he meant me.

38
00:02:48,903 --> 00:02:52,073
I'm Steve Murphy,
Drug Enforcement Agent.

39
00:02:52,157 --> 00:02:56,702
And as you can see,
I am deeply embedded in Colombia.

40
00:02:56,786 --> 00:02:57,829
Hello?

41
00:02:57,912 --> 00:03:00,373
Poison will be partying
at La Dispensaria.

42
00:03:00,457 --> 00:03:01,291
Got it.

43
00:03:01,374 --> 00:03:04,002
He's meeting Lizard
and the rest of them at midnight tonight.

44
00:03:04,085 --> 00:03:05,420
OK.

45
00:03:05,504 --> 00:03:08,089
I would've loved
to go after Poison myself,

46
00:03:08,173 --> 00:03:11,510
but the DEA is restricted
in a foreign country.

47
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:15,596
So I did just what you would do...
I called the cops.

48
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,848
Hola.

49
00:03:17,056 --> 00:03:20,601
La Dispensaria?

50
00:03:20,685 --> 00:03:21,727
All right.

51
00:03:24,397 --> 00:03:25,731
Guess who that was.

52
00:03:26,858 --> 00:03:28,067
Your partner.

53
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,862
He just gave me a great gift.

54
00:03:32,155 --> 00:03:33,323
Poison.

55
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:40,413
Does he know
how I'm going to package it?

56
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:42,665
Yeah, sure.

57
00:03:42,748 --> 00:03:44,876
He's not a fool.

58
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,170
Gotta go.

59
00:03:48,588 --> 00:03:51,257
Gonna stick me with the bill?

60
00:03:55,178 --> 00:03:57,805
Cheap son of a bitch.

61
00:03:57,889 --> 00:04:00,517
In case you're wondering,
this is the asshole.

62
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,478
Javier Peña, my partner.

63
00:04:03,686 --> 00:04:07,065
And this is Colonel Carrillo,
the leader of the Search Bloc,

64
00:04:07,148 --> 00:04:10,109
the unit we helped create
to capture the bad guys.

65
00:04:10,193 --> 00:04:12,987
Boy, did he have
a lot of love for the narcos.

66
00:04:16,366 --> 00:04:20,786
Party time in Zona Rosa.
Everybody goes there.

67
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,705
Especially the local hitmen.

68
00:04:22,788 --> 00:04:24,541
Colombians call them sicarios.

69
00:04:24,624 --> 00:04:27,377
- What's up, son?
- Hey, brother.

70
00:04:28,336 --> 00:04:30,880
Let's go inside and have a good time.

71
00:04:30,963 --> 00:04:32,965
Now, Poison, he was one of the best.

72
00:04:33,174 --> 00:04:36,969
Crazy motherfucker
who killed dozens of people.

73
00:04:37,053 --> 00:04:38,513
Probably hundreds.

74
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:40,390
But don't get me wrong.

75
00:04:40,473 --> 00:04:43,726
I would've sent Carrillo there
even if Poison never killed a fly.

76
00:04:45,061 --> 00:04:47,313
I don't have a lot of love
for the narcos either.

77
00:04:53,945 --> 00:04:55,780
It's on, boys!

78
00:04:55,863 --> 00:04:59,117
We're gonna stop on 14th
and go around the corner.

79
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,245
Riano, Trujillo,
you're in the front with me.

80
00:05:02,328 --> 00:05:04,539
- Galvis and Silva, you take up the rear.
- Yes, sir.

81
00:05:04,623 --> 00:05:07,125
You got it, boys? We're gonna
go at it with everything we got.

82
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:10,002
We're gonna kill these fuckers,
all right?

83
00:05:10,086 --> 00:05:11,504
Yes, sir!

84
00:05:23,224 --> 00:05:26,603
I wouldn't blame you if you
held me responsible for this bloodbath.

85
00:05:32,066 --> 00:05:34,026
Yeah, I pushed the buttons.

86
00:05:45,871 --> 00:05:48,541
But don't call me a bad guy just yet.

87
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,717
My fellow Americans...

88
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,135
Take Richard Nixon, for instance.

89
00:07:23,219 --> 00:07:27,306
People forget,
but 47 million Americans voted for Nixon.

90
00:07:28,224 --> 00:07:30,309
We thought he was one of the good guys.

91
00:07:30,518 --> 00:07:33,605
And Nixon thought Chilean General Pinochet
was a good guy

92
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:35,398
because he hated the commies.

93
00:07:35,607 --> 00:07:38,067
So we helped Pinochet seize power.

94
00:07:42,947 --> 00:07:46,284
Then Pinochet turned around
and killed thousands of people.

95
00:07:49,203 --> 00:07:52,039
Maybe not such a good guy after all.

96
00:07:58,963 --> 00:08:01,591
But sometimes,
bad guys do good things.

97
00:08:04,093 --> 00:08:08,055
Nobody knows this, but back in '73,
Chile was on its way

98
00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:12,059
to being the world's biggest
cocaine processing and exporting center.

99
00:08:13,352 --> 00:08:17,022
How many times do
I have to tell you not to waste the acid?

100
00:08:17,106 --> 00:08:20,652
They had deserts to hide the labs
and miles of unpatrolled coastline

101
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,861
to ship the product north.

102
00:08:21,944 --> 00:08:25,615
To be productive,
you can't waste money! Come on!

103
00:08:26,991 --> 00:08:28,701
You're surrounded!

104
00:08:28,785 --> 00:08:31,203
- Hands up!
- Everybody on your knees!

105
00:08:31,287 --> 00:08:32,831
But Pinochet spoiled the party.

106
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:34,791
What the fuck is going on here?

107
00:08:34,874 --> 00:08:35,875
On the ground!

108
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:40,212
He shut down 33 labs
and arrested 346 drug dealers.

109
00:08:43,883 --> 00:08:46,344
And then, being Pinochet...

110
00:08:48,012 --> 00:08:49,430
he had them all killed.

111
00:08:49,514 --> 00:08:52,141
Attention!

112
00:08:52,224 --> 00:08:54,769
Weapons ready!

113
00:08:54,853 --> 00:08:56,270
Aim!

114
00:08:57,271 --> 00:08:58,272
Ready ammunition!

115
00:09:00,149 --> 00:09:01,233
Fire!

116
00:09:10,618 --> 00:09:14,246
They say when
a nuclear holocaust destroys the world,

117
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:18,250
only the cockroaches will survive.

118
00:09:18,334 --> 00:09:20,044
I guess they were right.

119
00:09:23,297 --> 00:09:27,301
The bullets missed Mateo Moreno,
aka Cockroach,

120
00:09:27,385 --> 00:09:29,637
and he was smart enough to play dead.

121
00:09:33,182 --> 00:09:34,851
He wasn't killed on that day.

122
00:09:37,144 --> 00:09:40,272
Instead, he won the damn lottery.

123
00:09:43,609 --> 00:09:47,363
Cockroach had been
stealing from his bosses for months.

124
00:09:47,446 --> 00:09:50,783
Now he was left alone in the world
with the perfect product.

125
00:09:50,867 --> 00:09:54,370
A product whose offer
creates its own demand.

126
00:09:54,453 --> 00:09:57,832
Start packing.
We have to leave the country.

127
00:09:57,916 --> 00:10:00,793
Fucking Pinochet
is killing the whole world.

128
00:10:01,878 --> 00:10:06,340
- But you're not a communist.
- No, not a communist, something worse.

129
00:10:06,424 --> 00:10:08,760
A drug trafficker.

130
00:10:08,843 --> 00:10:12,096
- A drug trafficker?
- Yes, a drug trafficker.

131
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:18,603
Back then, we were just
finding out about the effects of cocaine

132
00:10:18,853 --> 00:10:21,522
on the human brain.

133
00:10:21,606 --> 00:10:24,859
We didn't know much, but we knew
it was some pretty powerful shit.

134
00:10:25,067 --> 00:10:27,278
This will give us better results, OK?

135
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:30,573
Cocaine hijacks
the pleasure centers in the brain.

136
00:10:30,656 --> 00:10:33,868
A rat will choose cocaine
over food and water.

137
00:10:33,952 --> 00:10:39,791
It would choose cocaine over sleep,
over sex... over life itself.

138
00:10:39,874 --> 00:10:43,002
The human brain
isn't quite the same as a rodent's...

139
00:10:45,004 --> 00:10:47,256
unless we're talking about cocaine.

140
00:10:53,554 --> 00:10:55,723
Cockroach knew
he had the perfect product.

141
00:10:56,724 --> 00:10:59,059
He just needed to smuggle it
to the right markets.

142
00:10:59,143 --> 00:11:00,519
Gracias.

143
00:11:02,563 --> 00:11:05,274
And the best smugglers in the world
were in Colombia.

144
00:11:05,357 --> 00:11:06,484
WELCOME TO COLOMBIA

145
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:12,698
Like Goldilocks,
he had three options.

146
00:11:12,782 --> 00:11:16,035
And pay attention, because all three
are important to this story.

147
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:23,918
Jorge, that's Fabio on the horse.

148
00:11:24,002 --> 00:11:27,713
A typical Colombian smuggling family.

149
00:11:27,797 --> 00:11:30,215
- They were smart and rich...
- Salud!

150
00:11:30,299 --> 00:11:33,469
But Cockroach felt the high life
had made 'em too soft.

151
00:11:34,512 --> 00:11:38,307
Another possible partner
was José Rodríguez Gacha,

152
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:42,186
nicknamed "The Mexican,"
for his love of tequila and sombreros.

153
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:45,064
He dominated the emerald smuggling routes.

154
00:11:51,696 --> 00:11:55,533
Emeralds are a pretty rough trade,
even by Colombian standards.

155
00:11:55,616 --> 00:11:57,117
If you make it to the top...

156
00:11:58,577 --> 00:12:01,580
it means you've killed your enemies.

157
00:12:03,499 --> 00:12:05,710
Hey, partner. What are you doing here?

158
00:12:05,918 --> 00:12:07,545
And sometimes, your partners.

159
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,387
Cockroach worried that the emerald trade
had made Gacha too hard.

160
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:25,021
A man Cockroach knew would be just right.

161
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:32,111
Yeah, you guessed it: Pablo Escobar.

162
00:12:32,194 --> 00:12:34,530
The man who would
change my life forever.

163
00:12:36,448 --> 00:12:39,744
Pablo was making a killing
in the smuggling business.

164
00:12:39,827 --> 00:12:42,287
Cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana,
you name it.

165
00:12:43,706 --> 00:12:47,167
At the time,
Pablo owned half the police in Medellín.

166
00:12:48,502 --> 00:12:51,756
But DAS was Colombia's version of the FBI.

167
00:12:52,924 --> 00:12:55,051
They didn't play by the same rules.

168
00:12:56,594 --> 00:12:57,929
Good day.

169
00:12:58,679 --> 00:12:59,972
Pablo Escobar?

170
00:13:00,056 --> 00:13:01,473
Where's Felipo?

171
00:13:01,682 --> 00:13:03,601
Felipo's been arrested.

172
00:13:03,684 --> 00:13:05,477
Bullshit. Felipo works for me.

173
00:13:05,561 --> 00:13:08,564
He used to work for you. Now he's going
to jail. What do you think about that?

174
00:13:08,647 --> 00:13:11,067
- Do you know who you're talking to?
- Shut the fuck up.

175
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:13,277
- I wasn't talking to you.
- Relax, Gustavo, please.

176
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,946
Show some respect.

177
00:13:17,115 --> 00:13:19,366
Now what's the problem,
Mr. Jose Luis?

178
00:13:21,827 --> 00:13:23,454
How do you know my name?

179
00:13:23,662 --> 00:13:25,706
You're Colonel Jose Luis Herrera.

180
00:13:28,667 --> 00:13:30,419
And that's Nacho Ibarra.

181
00:13:33,464 --> 00:13:37,468
There's Garcia, Lopez...

182
00:13:37,551 --> 00:13:39,595
- Is that Pinilla?
- Yes, Pinilla.

183
00:13:39,678 --> 00:13:40,805
- That's Pinilla.
- Yeah.

184
00:13:40,888 --> 00:13:42,389
Pinilla...

185
00:13:42,473 --> 00:13:44,308
and with Phillipe is Esparanza.

186
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:46,477
I don't give a rat's ass.
Open the fucking trucks.

187
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,104
I don't have all day.

188
00:13:52,441 --> 00:13:53,901
Open it.

189
00:14:03,327 --> 00:14:04,954
Tell me something, Mr. Escobar.

190
00:14:06,038 --> 00:14:07,748
Who the fuck do you think you are?

191
00:14:07,832 --> 00:14:11,251
You don't even bother
to hide your contraband.

192
00:14:11,335 --> 00:14:13,129
Because I pay for the privilege, Colonel.

193
00:14:13,212 --> 00:14:14,922
Oh, yeah? You don't say.

194
00:14:15,006 --> 00:14:16,799
Where are your import papers?

195
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,136
You need papers for these TV sets.

196
00:14:20,219 --> 00:14:21,637
Take them.

197
00:14:23,347 --> 00:14:28,435
Sorry, Mr. Escobar. We're not
Medellín police making a shit salary.

198
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:30,855
- Look, brother, it's not for you.
- Then who?

199
00:14:30,938 --> 00:14:32,731
It's for Carlitos.

200
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,775
Your son.

201
00:14:36,944 --> 00:14:39,655
Wouldn't he like a TV in his room?

202
00:14:41,824 --> 00:14:43,159
Hey, Pinilla!

203
00:14:45,369 --> 00:14:48,539
Your daughter just
got her driver's license, right?

204
00:14:48,622 --> 00:14:54,545
I've got some car stereo systems in there
that are really cool. Real nice.

205
00:14:55,671 --> 00:14:59,842
That friend of yours, Lopez...
he's got a wife that's really beautiful.

206
00:14:59,925 --> 00:15:03,345
- Right? She's a fox.
- Yeah.

207
00:15:03,428 --> 00:15:05,223
Your wife is gorgeous, brother.

208
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,184
What's she doing with a guy like you?

209
00:15:14,732 --> 00:15:17,026
I think she deserves some jewelry, no?

210
00:15:19,237 --> 00:15:22,240
Why don't I have my boys
drop off a few gifts?

211
00:15:26,326 --> 00:15:28,829
Colonel, how is your mom doing?

212
00:15:28,913 --> 00:15:32,083
- She just got out of the hospital, right?
- Yes, she's feeling better.

213
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:35,335
- Good. That makes us happy, right?
- Yes.

214
00:15:36,587 --> 00:15:37,880
Gentlemen...

215
00:15:38,964 --> 00:15:41,133
I'm going to tell you who I am.

216
00:15:42,342 --> 00:15:45,512
I am Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria.

217
00:15:46,597 --> 00:15:48,891
My eyes are everywhere.

218
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:52,937
That means you guys
can't move a finger in all of Antioquia

219
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,105
without me knowing about it.

220
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:57,275
Do you understand? Not a finger.

221
00:15:59,651 --> 00:16:04,115
One day, I'm going to be
President of the Republic of Colombia.

222
00:16:05,116 --> 00:16:09,245
So look, I make deals for a living.

223
00:16:09,328 --> 00:16:12,873
Now, you can stay calm
and accept my deal...

224
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:16,210
or accept the consequences.

225
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,215
Silver...

226
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,426
or lead.

227
00:16:25,928 --> 00:16:27,471
You decide.

228
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:34,061
- Let 'em go. Let 'em go.
- All right, then.

229
00:17:20,149 --> 00:17:21,733
Yo, Pablo!

230
00:17:22,484 --> 00:17:24,195
- This is Pablo.
- Hello.

231
00:17:24,278 --> 00:17:26,238
- Nice to meet you.
- Mateo Moreno.

232
00:17:26,322 --> 00:17:28,824
No, no, no.
"Cockroach" to my friends.

233
00:17:28,907 --> 00:17:30,826
All right,
yesterday we were talking,

234
00:17:30,909 --> 00:17:35,373
and I think this business
can make us a lot of money.

235
00:17:35,455 --> 00:17:36,832
Explain.

236
00:17:36,915 --> 00:17:39,960
Well... I get the paste in Peru.

237
00:17:40,044 --> 00:17:42,087
I will handle
the chemical part of production,

238
00:17:42,171 --> 00:17:44,673
and all the other details
in producing this exquisite white powder.

239
00:17:44,756 --> 00:17:47,176
What I need from you
is to help me get it into Colombia.

240
00:17:47,385 --> 00:17:50,637
Now tell him how much it costs.

241
00:17:50,846 --> 00:17:54,683
In Chile, this little thing
costs ten bucks a gram.

242
00:17:54,892 --> 00:17:58,520
- They sell it by grams?
- Yes, it's very good. Look...

243
00:17:58,603 --> 00:18:03,817
You do a little bit, and in 20 minutes,
you want to do some more.

244
00:18:04,026 --> 00:18:05,403
Also...

245
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,822
it's a digestive aid.
It makes you want to take a shit.

246
00:18:08,906 --> 00:18:11,450
It's very clean, this stuff.
Want some?

247
00:18:12,826 --> 00:18:15,162
If this is really that good
and we can make some money,

248
00:18:15,246 --> 00:18:17,164
we can find room on our trucks.

249
00:18:17,248 --> 00:18:19,708
We can sell it in Bogotá, Barranquilla,
Cali, Cartagena...

250
00:18:19,917 --> 00:18:22,169
We're going to be rich.

251
00:18:22,253 --> 00:18:25,005
- What did you say your name was?
- Cockroach.

252
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:28,467
Well look, Cuca...

253
00:18:29,427 --> 00:18:31,470
you don't have any vision,
my friend.

254
00:18:34,265 --> 00:18:36,475
If it costs ten dollars a gram here...

255
00:18:37,517 --> 00:18:40,729
imagine how much
it will sell for in Miami.

256
00:18:43,857 --> 00:18:46,318
I love that song.

257
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:51,073
Rodrigo! One more.

258
00:19:13,471 --> 00:19:16,932
Back then, Miami was a paradise.

259
00:19:17,015 --> 00:19:19,893
I signed up for the sand,
surf and women.

260
00:19:21,603 --> 00:19:24,815
In '79, the bad guys I was chasing
wore flip-flops.

261
00:19:24,898 --> 00:19:26,066
DEA! Stop!

262
00:19:26,275 --> 00:19:30,279
I was a young DEA agent,
partnered with my buddy, Kevin Brady.

263
00:19:31,489 --> 00:19:33,532
Kevin was a little slow afoot.

264
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,078
Why you running, huh?

265
00:19:38,287 --> 00:19:41,165
What you got? What is this? Huh?

266
00:19:41,248 --> 00:19:42,166
What is that?

267
00:19:42,249 --> 00:19:45,377
That right there...
that's a goddamn promotion.

268
00:19:45,461 --> 00:19:47,546
Let's go celebrate.

269
00:19:47,754 --> 00:19:49,214
- Whoo!
- Look at that.

270
00:19:51,675 --> 00:19:54,178
Go! Go! Go!

271
00:19:54,261 --> 00:19:56,721
How you like me now?

272
00:19:56,805 --> 00:19:57,973
How much money you owe me?

273
00:19:58,182 --> 00:19:59,808
What happened to the money
you owed me last week?

274
00:19:59,933 --> 00:20:01,519
That's right, that's right.

275
00:20:04,104 --> 00:20:07,107
All right.
All right, who do we pick?

276
00:20:07,316 --> 00:20:08,817
How 'bout her?

277
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,319
No, no, no,
we gotta fuck with him.

278
00:20:10,402 --> 00:20:12,404
- Yeah, let's mess with his head.
- Um...

279
00:20:12,488 --> 00:20:14,323
Oh, right there.
See her? At the bar?

280
00:20:14,406 --> 00:20:16,534
- Which one?
- Blue top, blond hair. That's his type.

281
00:20:16,741 --> 00:20:19,703
- Oh! Strike!
- She's hot.

282
00:20:19,786 --> 00:20:21,079
- All right.
- Whoo!

283
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:23,290
Murph! Sparrow, three o'clock.

284
00:20:23,374 --> 00:20:27,211
Hey, while you were walking back,
she was checking your ass out.

285
00:20:27,294 --> 00:20:28,837
Oh, she was checking out your ass.

286
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,339
Get the fuck outta here.
Come on.

287
00:20:30,422 --> 00:20:34,301
Listen, she eye-fucked you
the entire time you were bowling.

288
00:20:34,385 --> 00:20:37,054
She was. She was eye-fucking you.
The entire time.

289
00:20:37,262 --> 00:20:40,682
I'm serious, I'm serious. Look at her.

290
00:20:40,891 --> 00:20:43,477
- Uh-huh. That's his type.
- Talking about the blond one?

291
00:20:43,561 --> 00:20:45,103
No, the other one.
Of course the blond one.

292
00:20:45,187 --> 00:20:46,897
She's the hottest one there.
She's your type.

293
00:20:47,647 --> 00:20:50,942
You dicking me around?

294
00:20:53,904 --> 00:20:55,280
Fuck it, I'm going in.

295
00:20:55,364 --> 00:20:56,532
- Go get her.
- Mm!

296
00:20:56,615 --> 00:20:58,409
- Yup.
- Hey, while you're up there,

297
00:20:58,492 --> 00:20:59,993
get us another pitcher, will ya?

298
00:21:00,202 --> 00:21:03,205
- Pace yourself.
- Look at him. Look at his swagger.

299
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,716
How you doing?

300
00:21:15,551 --> 00:21:16,552
Busy.

301
00:21:18,178 --> 00:21:21,681
I just said, "Look, if you don't
wanna be there, you don't have to be."

302
00:21:21,765 --> 00:21:24,976
No one's forcing you to do anything."
So, I don't know...

303
00:21:28,397 --> 00:21:31,024
Yeah, those bastards got me.

304
00:21:31,108 --> 00:21:33,444
But I couldn't let it end like that.

305
00:21:33,527 --> 00:21:36,363
Excuse me.
See those guys over there?

306
00:21:37,656 --> 00:21:38,949
Uh, they're fucking with me.

307
00:21:39,032 --> 00:21:42,494
Telling me you were checking out my ass,
and who checks out a cop's ass, right?

308
00:21:42,578 --> 00:21:43,828
You're a cop?

309
00:21:43,912 --> 00:21:46,248
Not a cop, actually. I'm DEA.

310
00:21:46,457 --> 00:21:47,499
Drug Enforcement?

311
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:49,585
So you're the one
making pot more expensive.

312
00:21:50,419 --> 00:21:52,963
Come on, why don't you do me a favor?

313
00:21:53,046 --> 00:21:55,633
I wanna show these guys up.
Why don't you, uh...

314
00:21:55,715 --> 00:21:57,426
give me your phone number?

315
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,844
How about a fake number?

316
00:22:00,929 --> 00:22:01,930
That'll work.

317
00:22:02,764 --> 00:22:04,475
Hey, buddy, you got a pen?

318
00:22:19,156 --> 00:22:21,741
- I'm sorry for the trouble.
- Sure.

319
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,244
Have a good night.

320
00:22:26,913 --> 00:22:29,625
Aah...

321
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:30,875
Shot down!

322
00:22:32,043 --> 00:22:34,713
- Where's the pitcher at?
- The pitcher? Oh, I...

323
00:22:35,422 --> 00:22:36,881
I didn't make it back
with the pitcher.

324
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:40,344
I just came up with this and
I couldn't read it. What does that say?

325
00:22:40,427 --> 00:22:42,887
- Read it and weep!
- Aw... Gimme that.

326
00:22:42,971 --> 00:22:44,640
How much did that cost you?

327
00:22:44,723 --> 00:22:46,850
- That's your handwriting.
- It's not my handwriting!

328
00:22:53,565 --> 00:22:55,942
I figured, what the hell.

329
00:22:56,026 --> 00:22:59,446
Worst that could happen,
I'd wake up some grandmother in Boca.

330
00:23:05,827 --> 00:23:07,037
Hello?

331
00:23:08,539 --> 00:23:09,998
So it wasn't a fake.

332
00:23:10,207 --> 00:23:12,543
I thought you might figure it out.

333
00:23:12,626 --> 00:23:15,045
After all, you're DEA.

334
00:23:15,128 --> 00:23:18,507
And just like that... she had me.

335
00:23:19,924 --> 00:23:24,971
The minute Pablo laid his eyes
on the paste-processing labs in Peru,

336
00:23:25,055 --> 00:23:26,848
cocaine had him.

337
00:23:29,851 --> 00:23:31,269
It's been a while.

338
00:23:31,353 --> 00:23:33,938
These are my friends,
Pablo and Gustavo.

339
00:23:35,023 --> 00:23:37,442
Would you like a little coffee?

340
00:23:37,526 --> 00:23:39,152
Yeah, a coffee?

341
00:23:39,236 --> 00:23:40,237
Yes, a coffee.

342
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,405
- How about you, Pablo?
- No.

343
00:23:41,488 --> 00:23:43,031
You sure?

344
00:23:43,114 --> 00:23:47,244
My factory is small,
but highly productive.

345
00:23:47,327 --> 00:23:52,207
Look. For crushing the leaves, I like to
use children because of their tiny feet.

346
00:23:54,376 --> 00:23:55,960
Little magic leaves.

347
00:23:56,878 --> 00:23:59,798
The kerosene
separates the drug from the leaf.

348
00:23:59,881 --> 00:24:05,845
Over here, the sulfuric acid
distills and distills it.

349
00:24:05,929 --> 00:24:11,017
Then you cut it,
and mix it with gasoline.

350
00:24:11,101 --> 00:24:15,105
Then, basically, you pull the merchandise
out of the liquid.

351
00:24:15,188 --> 00:24:17,023
Let it dry, dry, dry.

352
00:24:17,107 --> 00:24:18,858
You use ammonia to get the paste.

353
00:24:18,942 --> 00:24:24,489
And here it is.
It's pasty... but pure.

354
00:24:24,573 --> 00:24:26,825
Here is the prize.

355
00:24:26,908 --> 00:24:29,327
It's like the kitchen in your house.

356
00:24:30,245 --> 00:24:33,415
Like baking a cake.

357
00:24:34,249 --> 00:24:37,419
Only a much better cake
than you've ever had.

358
00:24:39,588 --> 00:24:41,715
Look, an old press, an antique.

359
00:24:46,177 --> 00:24:49,306
Now we put it in the oven.

360
00:24:49,389 --> 00:24:52,016
Here's one.
The other will follow.

361
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:55,186
All natural, organic and healthy.
Very good.

362
00:24:56,062 --> 00:24:57,439
Well...

363
00:24:58,523 --> 00:25:01,985
- we'll take a kilo.
- A whole kilo. Perfect.

364
00:25:02,068 --> 00:25:05,280
- No.
- You said a kilo.

365
00:25:05,363 --> 00:25:06,782
We'll take five.

366
00:25:06,865 --> 00:25:10,786
How do we get five across the border?

367
00:25:10,869 --> 00:25:12,746
That's Gustavo's department.

368
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,462
This one has got a good engine.

369
00:25:20,545 --> 00:25:23,173
I was taking a look at it,
and the best place to hide the merchandise

370
00:25:23,256 --> 00:25:25,467
would be under the rear wheel well.

371
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:27,678
It's 22 and one half horsepower.

372
00:25:27,761 --> 00:25:29,095
Is this easy to take off?

373
00:25:29,179 --> 00:25:31,890
Don't worry about that shit.
I'll stick five kilos in there easy.

374
00:25:31,973 --> 00:25:34,351
All right, all right.
I'll take three cars, please.

375
00:25:34,434 --> 00:25:37,395
- Sure, when do you need them?
- Now, brother.

376
00:25:38,188 --> 00:25:41,065
All right, we'll take the cars
and head back to the lab.

377
00:25:41,149 --> 00:25:43,318
Why the fuck
are we going back to the lab?

378
00:25:43,401 --> 00:25:48,573
Because there are four wheel wells per car
and that's 20 kilos.

379
00:25:48,657 --> 00:25:50,868
For three cars, that's 60 kilos.

380
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:54,287
So if it's nine dollars
profit per gram, what?

381
00:25:54,371 --> 00:25:55,914
$9,000 per kilo.

382
00:25:55,997 --> 00:25:58,542
$9,000 times 60...
The profit is $540,000.

383
00:25:58,625 --> 00:26:00,836
That's it!

384
00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:02,754
- Do you know how to drive, Cockroach?
- Yeah.

385
00:26:02,838 --> 00:26:04,548
OK, Pablo and I drive fast.

386
00:26:04,756 --> 00:26:08,510
That's half a million dollars... per trip,

387
00:26:08,593 --> 00:26:11,722
using the same smuggling routes
he always used.

388
00:26:14,516 --> 00:26:16,309
Easiest money he ever made.

389
00:26:21,648 --> 00:26:24,568
Back in Medellín,
Pablo didn't waste any time.

390
00:26:24,651 --> 00:26:26,319
He bought a house
in his old neighborhood

391
00:26:26,403 --> 00:26:31,449
and opened his first lab to turn
Peruvian paste... into cocaine powder.

392
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:34,285
How are you feeling, Gustavo?

393
00:26:35,913 --> 00:26:37,873
All this smells like shit to me.

394
00:26:37,956 --> 00:26:41,501
What an ignorant bastard.
It's like French cheese.

395
00:26:41,585 --> 00:26:43,921
The stinkier, the better.

396
00:26:44,588 --> 00:26:45,839
All right.

397
00:26:46,882 --> 00:26:48,675
What about all these lights?

398
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:52,763
Is that to tip off the cops,
or what?

399
00:26:52,846 --> 00:26:57,183
Just worry about transporting the stuff
and selling it.

400
00:26:57,267 --> 00:27:00,186
I'm the artist here, clear?

401
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:01,479
Clear.

402
00:27:01,563 --> 00:27:03,607
- Right?
- Yeah. Mm-mm.

403
00:27:03,774 --> 00:27:08,069
It was a mom-and-pop operation,
so small they called it The Kitchen.

404
00:27:08,152 --> 00:27:11,907
But make no mistake,
it would change Medellín forever.

405
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:14,451
You know the thing
that has me worried, Pablo?

406
00:27:20,791 --> 00:27:23,919
Don't you think the workers
will choke with all that smoke?

407
00:27:31,593 --> 00:27:33,219
Let's build them a chimney.

408
00:27:37,015 --> 00:27:39,517
There you go.

409
00:27:41,603 --> 00:27:43,521
Gentlemen, the first three?

410
00:27:43,605 --> 00:27:47,066
If this business makes so much money,
why are you sending me coach?

411
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:49,193
We just started up.
We have to be careful with money.

412
00:27:49,277 --> 00:27:52,530
- Don't be a dick.
- No, no, don't give me that dumb shit.

413
00:27:52,614 --> 00:27:56,117
- Come on.
- How much can a first class ticket cost?

414
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,286
I don't know.
Why don't you buy it yourself?

415
00:28:01,498 --> 00:28:05,335
Like her son, Pablo's mother
Hermilda was very resourceful.

416
00:28:06,044 --> 00:28:09,547
Hey, Mom,
how much do you think we can fit in there?

417
00:28:09,631 --> 00:28:13,051
- Around five kilos, honey.
- That much?

418
00:28:13,134 --> 00:28:14,552
Trust me, Pablito.

419
00:28:14,636 --> 00:28:16,596
I love it. Let's do it.

420
00:28:20,017 --> 00:28:22,602
- Pablo.
- Thank you, my love.

421
00:28:25,647 --> 00:28:26,940
It's Gustavo.

422
00:28:27,816 --> 00:28:29,150
Five kilos, right?

423
00:28:29,233 --> 00:28:32,779
Pablo loved his young bride Tata,
and she loved him.

424
00:28:32,863 --> 00:28:35,281
He was a family man till the end.

425
00:28:35,365 --> 00:28:38,535
The guy they got to wear the jacket
was the Lion.

426
00:28:38,618 --> 00:28:40,453
- Meet my friend.
- Hello, how are you doing?

427
00:28:40,537 --> 00:28:41,663
Hey, Pablo, this is Lion.

428
00:28:41,746 --> 00:28:44,875
He was a friend of Gustavo's who'd
spent his childhood in the United States.

429
00:28:44,958 --> 00:28:47,293
Says he wants to fly first class.
It's not like we're rich, right?

430
00:28:47,377 --> 00:28:49,379
Pablo Escobar Gaviria.
How are you?

431
00:28:49,462 --> 00:28:51,006
- Lion.
- Pleased to meet you, Lion.

432
00:28:51,089 --> 00:28:52,340
Here's three.

433
00:28:52,423 --> 00:28:55,052
We're going to need two more,
right, Mom?

434
00:28:55,134 --> 00:28:56,928
- That's right.
- Pablito...

435
00:28:57,012 --> 00:28:59,430
make sure it is not you
who wears it, OK?

436
00:28:59,514 --> 00:29:02,767
Look, my love...
it won't fit me.

437
00:29:02,851 --> 00:29:04,602
Try it on.

438
00:29:04,686 --> 00:29:05,896
Come here.

439
00:29:05,979 --> 00:29:07,772
That's it.

440
00:29:07,856 --> 00:29:09,273
Good, right?

441
00:29:11,818 --> 00:29:12,861
One...

442
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:16,239
- two...
- Wow, it holds a lot!

443
00:29:16,322 --> 00:29:17,782
Three.

444
00:29:19,576 --> 00:29:21,619
- Two more.
- Got it. I'll be right back.

445
00:29:21,703 --> 00:29:23,371
He looks really handsome,
doesn't he?

446
00:29:23,454 --> 00:29:26,332
Listen, Lion,
that jacket fits you very nicely.

447
00:29:26,416 --> 00:29:30,003
Yeah. Excuse me, ma'am, can you adjust
the jacket a little bit here in the back?

448
00:29:30,087 --> 00:29:31,588
- Aah!
- Listen to this guy.

449
00:29:31,671 --> 00:29:33,757
He looks very handsome, son.

450
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,175
Like a fag model, isn't that right?

451
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:41,180
The Lion was one of the first guys
to ever bring coke into Miami.

452
00:29:44,267 --> 00:29:45,602
Welcome to the United States.

453
00:29:45,685 --> 00:29:48,354
Thank you. Have a great day.

454
00:29:48,438 --> 00:29:49,313
Next, please.

455
00:29:49,397 --> 00:29:53,192
His contact was a crazy nut job
named Carlos Lehder,

456
00:29:53,276 --> 00:29:58,156
half Colombian, half German,
and 100 percent playboy.

457
00:29:58,239 --> 00:30:01,534
Big fan of John Lennon and Adolf Hitler.

458
00:30:01,618 --> 00:30:03,411
Go figure.

459
00:30:03,494 --> 00:30:07,415
Back in '79, this piece of work
was flying bales of grass up from Colombia

460
00:30:07,498 --> 00:30:09,084
on a fleet of small planes.

461
00:30:09,167 --> 00:30:11,086
- What's up?
- What's up, son?

462
00:30:11,169 --> 00:30:13,212
- Welcome.
- Thanks a lot. How are ya?

463
00:30:13,296 --> 00:30:14,798
- Everything good?
- Everything's good.

464
00:30:14,881 --> 00:30:16,507
Whoo! It's so hot.

465
00:30:16,591 --> 00:30:18,468
What the hell are you doing
with a jacket on?

466
00:30:18,551 --> 00:30:19,928
You like my jacket, brother?

467
00:30:20,011 --> 00:30:23,140
I got it in Colombia and look,
it has a little gift.

468
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:27,769
I was in jail for a while, remember?

469
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:31,898
I saw this shit there.
It's pure poison.

470
00:30:31,982 --> 00:30:34,776
What you got there
is the perfect product.

471
00:30:34,859 --> 00:30:37,320
Pablo says the gringos
will fall in love with this shit.

472
00:30:37,403 --> 00:30:40,239
It's gonna fuck up their brains,
that's for sure.

473
00:30:40,323 --> 00:30:41,365
Yes, sir.

474
00:30:45,078 --> 00:30:46,245
Here you go.

475
00:30:47,705 --> 00:30:49,833
Go on. There are five kilos.

476
00:30:50,625 --> 00:30:51,668
Where are you going?

477
00:30:51,918 --> 00:30:54,337
I'm gonna get another jacket,
brother.

478
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,756
We'll meet at the same time tomorrow,
all right?

479
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:03,638
The Lion made more than 20 flights
between Medellín and Miami.

480
00:31:03,721 --> 00:31:06,016
Drugs in, cash out.

481
00:31:06,224 --> 00:31:09,352
And the rich and famous in Miami
snorted every single gram of it.

482
00:31:09,435 --> 00:31:12,897
And in no time,
Pablo had to replace his cars with trucks.

483
00:31:14,024 --> 00:31:16,567
Gustavo had the trucks
filled to the brim with potatoes,

484
00:31:16,651 --> 00:31:19,029
the major item
Colombia imported from Peru.

485
00:31:20,071 --> 00:31:22,115
He didn't even have to bribe the cops.

486
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,743
The coke paste
was hidden in the spare tires.

487
00:31:25,827 --> 00:31:28,287
Each tire could fit about 20 kilos.

488
00:31:28,371 --> 00:31:32,167
Ten trucks, 20 kilos each,
going back and forth every day...

489
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:36,337
You do the math.
No way the Lion could transport it all.

490
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,798
Pretty soon,
the Lion had to come up with new ways

491
00:31:38,882 --> 00:31:40,967
to smuggle the drug to Miami.

492
00:31:41,051 --> 00:31:43,678
The briefcase doesn't have a false bottom?

493
00:31:43,761 --> 00:31:46,264
You guys are pilots,

494
00:31:46,347 --> 00:31:49,726
so you can get this stuff by
without a problem.

495
00:31:51,269 --> 00:31:55,648
Look, it's $150,000 per kilo,
so whatever you want.

496
00:31:57,275 --> 00:31:58,693
We'll take four.

497
00:31:58,776 --> 00:32:00,237
All right, much better.

498
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:05,033
Take these two and tell Jairo
to give you two more. All right?

499
00:32:05,116 --> 00:32:08,161
- All right.
- Perfect. Thank you very much.

500
00:32:08,245 --> 00:32:09,787
- See you later.
- Later.

501
00:32:11,206 --> 00:32:12,498
Come in, please.

502
00:32:17,628 --> 00:32:20,381
Look, here are the packets.

503
00:32:20,464 --> 00:32:24,052
You take a packet...
you dip it in the oil and swallow it.

504
00:32:24,135 --> 00:32:25,428
Easy, right?

505
00:32:25,511 --> 00:32:28,056
You swallow 50,
and I pay you $10,000.

506
00:32:28,139 --> 00:32:29,224
All right?

507
00:32:29,307 --> 00:32:31,392
But with you two,
we have a problem.

508
00:32:31,475 --> 00:32:33,394
You girls are pregnant, right?

509
00:32:33,477 --> 00:32:38,108
That's good, because US Customs
won't search pregnant women.

510
00:32:38,191 --> 00:32:43,029
You two can easily swallow 70
instead of 50.

511
00:32:43,113 --> 00:32:46,241
And I'll pay you $15,000
to help you with the kids.

512
00:32:46,324 --> 00:32:48,785
All right? All right. Perfect.

513
00:32:49,744 --> 00:32:52,705
During the early '80s,
most flights out of Bogotá

514
00:32:52,789 --> 00:32:54,624
had several mules on them.

515
00:32:54,707 --> 00:32:56,793
They didn't even know about each other.

516
00:32:56,876 --> 00:32:58,461
And you know what?

517
00:32:58,544 --> 00:33:02,673
Getting in was easy, because nobody
worried about cocaine in America.

518
00:33:02,757 --> 00:33:04,717
All we cared about was grass.

519
00:33:07,804 --> 00:33:12,309
Pretty soon, cocaine was hidden in
almost every legitimate Colombian export.

520
00:33:12,391 --> 00:33:16,437
Fish, coffee, flowers, rubber hoses...
anything.

521
00:33:33,579 --> 00:33:35,498
But even that didn't do it.

522
00:33:36,374 --> 00:33:40,837
The real game changer was filling
Lehder's planes with coke instead of weed.

523
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:46,050
Do you trust this guy?

524
00:33:46,134 --> 00:33:48,719
I don't know.
He was in prison in the United States.

525
00:33:48,803 --> 00:33:51,889
- So is he gay or what?
- Oh, for sure he's gay.

526
00:33:51,973 --> 00:33:53,599
But he's got good routes.

527
00:33:57,687 --> 00:33:59,314
- Amigos!
- Hello, Carlos.

528
00:33:59,397 --> 00:34:00,773
Gustavo Gaviria,
nice to meet you.

529
00:34:00,857 --> 00:34:02,108
- Nice to meet you.
- My cousin.

530
00:34:02,192 --> 00:34:04,027
Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria.
Nice to meet you.

531
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:07,113
- Cousin? Nice to meet you.
- How was your flight?

532
00:34:07,197 --> 00:34:08,698
Smooth.

533
00:34:08,781 --> 00:34:10,033
Let's get down to business.

534
00:34:10,116 --> 00:34:13,995
The Lion tells us you've been transporting
a lot of marijuana in your plane.

535
00:34:14,078 --> 00:34:17,332
- That's true.
- About how much per flight?

536
00:34:18,124 --> 00:34:20,126
- How far?
- Miami.

537
00:34:24,005 --> 00:34:26,590
- Somewhere around 1000 kilos.
- 1000 kilos?

538
00:34:26,674 --> 00:34:28,426
Counting the gasoline.

539
00:34:37,227 --> 00:34:38,353
Carlos...

540
00:34:39,229 --> 00:34:40,355
Yes?

541
00:34:44,483 --> 00:34:47,778
What if we take out the seats,
the carpet and all the other crap

542
00:34:47,862 --> 00:34:51,657
and only leave space for the pilot?
Can you fit more?

543
00:34:51,741 --> 00:34:53,492
We'll leave the engine, right?

544
00:34:54,785 --> 00:34:56,287
How much more?

545
00:34:56,371 --> 00:34:58,789
About... 300 more.

546
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:03,836
All right then, Mr. Carlos.
Let's take a walk.

547
00:35:06,464 --> 00:35:08,258
Within months after meeting Cockroach,

548
00:35:08,341 --> 00:35:13,430
Pablo was establishing the first dedicated
narco routes from Colombia to America.

549
00:35:14,764 --> 00:35:18,101
It was a real milestone
in the story of narcotics, folks.

550
00:35:19,102 --> 00:35:22,272
Then Pablo closed The Kitchen
and started opening cocaine labs

551
00:35:22,355 --> 00:35:23,856
in the middle of the jungle.

552
00:35:26,525 --> 00:35:28,903
Under the canopy cover
of the Colombian rainforest,

553
00:35:28,986 --> 00:35:33,991
he could expand his production capability
indefinitely without anybody noticing it.

554
00:35:37,995 --> 00:35:40,290
We brought you a little present.

555
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:43,667
Brazilians.

556
00:35:45,295 --> 00:35:48,547
Best asses in the world,
believe me.

557
00:35:48,631 --> 00:35:51,134
No, I'm not feeling well.

558
00:35:51,217 --> 00:35:52,760
- What's up, Cuca?
- Hello.

559
00:35:53,636 --> 00:35:54,720
Hey, Gustavo.

560
00:35:55,679 --> 00:35:58,182
What the fuck is up with you guys?

561
00:35:58,266 --> 00:36:00,935
You're flying around in planes...

562
00:36:01,018 --> 00:36:03,313
- while I'm rotting here in this jungle?
- Look, Cuca...

563
00:36:03,396 --> 00:36:06,065
Look, let us explain what we have to...

564
00:36:06,149 --> 00:36:07,817
Wait.

565
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:11,195
From now on,
in all of my labs...

566
00:36:11,279 --> 00:36:15,866
I'll build a large house
with air-conditioning, with a pool...

567
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:18,369
- And whores from Brazil.
- And whores from Brazil.

568
00:36:18,453 --> 00:36:20,871
- Just for you.
- One problem.

569
00:36:20,955 --> 00:36:24,875
These are my labs. Mm?

570
00:36:30,756 --> 00:36:34,969
Relax.
No one's arguing with you.

571
00:36:35,052 --> 00:36:37,472
Come show me the production
and we'll talk later.

572
00:36:37,721 --> 00:36:40,808
Pablo couldn't hide his success
from his friends.

573
00:36:40,891 --> 00:36:44,562
They were violent, crazy and filthy rich.

574
00:36:44,645 --> 00:36:47,857
Guys used to getting what they want,
one way or another.

575
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:51,652
How something like this
can make so much money!

576
00:36:51,735 --> 00:36:55,906
Now I ask myself...
if I should get involved with this.

577
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:57,950
What do you think, Pablo?

578
00:36:58,034 --> 00:37:00,411
I heard the "potato" business
is like the "egg" business.

579
00:37:00,619 --> 00:37:02,163
I wouldn't get involved.

580
00:37:02,246 --> 00:37:05,500
Look, man,
I took a good look at the market.

581
00:37:05,708 --> 00:37:07,835
Importing potatoes from Peru is easy.

582
00:37:07,918 --> 00:37:12,298
- Of course. Same old contraband routes.
- Mm.

583
00:37:12,382 --> 00:37:15,301
Be careful, guys. If we all start
buying potatoes at the same time,

584
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:19,096
the Peruvians will raise the price.

585
00:37:20,598 --> 00:37:23,100
They also grow potatoes in Bolivia.

586
00:37:23,184 --> 00:37:26,604
We can reduce the cost of
the refining process if we buy together.

587
00:37:26,687 --> 00:37:31,442
Well, guys, the hard part
is getting the merchandise to Miami.

588
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:35,905
You need a lot of creativity for that.

589
00:37:36,697 --> 00:37:40,159
How much would you charge us
to be "creative"?

590
00:37:40,243 --> 00:37:44,038
You deliver the product to me, labeled.

591
00:37:44,121 --> 00:37:47,666
I will take it to Miami
and deliver it to your contact there.

592
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:50,336
Better yet, Lehder will do it.

593
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:53,506
I'll charge 35 percent of the sales value,

594
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:58,094
but I'll insure the safety of your load
up to 50 percent of the value.

595
00:37:58,177 --> 00:38:00,012
The potato business is ours.
We don't need...

596
00:38:00,221 --> 00:38:01,847
Deal?

597
00:38:05,101 --> 00:38:06,269
Deal.

598
00:38:06,977 --> 00:38:08,563
Sounds good to me.

599
00:38:10,022 --> 00:38:14,026
All right,
I will create my own routes

600
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:17,655
and stop using your services
as soon as possible. OK?

601
00:38:17,738 --> 00:38:19,616
We expect nothing less, Gonzalo.

602
00:38:20,699 --> 00:38:22,076
Partners?

603
00:38:26,163 --> 00:38:28,958
We know your policy toward partners.

604
00:38:30,543 --> 00:38:32,211
Let's just call us...

605
00:38:32,462 --> 00:38:34,046
"friendly associates."

606
00:38:35,881 --> 00:38:37,341
To Miami.

607
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:39,510
To Miami!

608
00:38:49,687 --> 00:38:54,191
When I started, a one-kilo
grass bust was cause for celebration.

609
00:39:00,406 --> 00:39:04,118
And before long,
we were seizing 60 kilos of coke a day.

610
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:09,666
We thought we were
making a huge difference.

611
00:39:15,921 --> 00:39:18,675
Truth is,
we weren't even making a dent.

612
00:39:19,967 --> 00:39:22,928
They let us have 60
so they could bring in 600.

613
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,357
Pablo's coke flooded in.

614
00:39:35,399 --> 00:39:37,901
It didn't take long
for Miami to get addicted.

615
00:39:37,985 --> 00:39:39,445
And I mean that.

616
00:39:40,279 --> 00:39:43,700
It was like the whole city was
running around trying to get this shit.

617
00:39:45,201 --> 00:39:46,703
And with the money...

618
00:39:47,786 --> 00:39:49,664
came the violence.

619
00:39:51,915 --> 00:39:53,834
The hippies had been
replaced by Colombians,

620
00:39:53,917 --> 00:39:56,587
and these guys didn't wear flip-flops.

621
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:23,573
The Miami coroner
said Colombians were like Dixie cups.

622
00:40:25,157 --> 00:40:27,493
Use 'em once,
then throw 'em away.

623
00:40:28,911 --> 00:40:32,998
The Dade County morgue couldn't
fit all the bodies from the drug war.

624
00:40:33,082 --> 00:40:35,959
They had to rent a refrigerated truck
from a local company

625
00:40:36,043 --> 00:40:38,003
to hold all the extra corpses.

626
00:40:40,214 --> 00:40:42,049
That was the first person I ever shot.

627
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:45,511
A teenager not old enough
to buy a six-pack.

628
00:41:05,239 --> 00:41:08,325
Hey... it was self-defense.

629
00:41:08,534 --> 00:41:11,495
- Kevin called you?
- He's worried about you.

630
00:41:12,413 --> 00:41:14,498
Did he forget to tell you
the kid was 17?

631
00:41:15,499 --> 00:41:17,126
He sells drugs, right?

632
00:41:18,544 --> 00:41:20,421
- Yeah.
- Yeah, then fuck him.

633
00:41:27,428 --> 00:41:28,721
What happened?

634
00:41:32,015 --> 00:41:34,560
- Coming through!
- I was about to finish my shift

635
00:41:34,811 --> 00:41:36,895
when we got hit
with the lights and sirens.

636
00:41:36,979 --> 00:41:38,314
Stay with me.

637
00:41:38,522 --> 00:41:39,982
I have an unconscious pregnant female.

638
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:44,069
Paramedics said she collapsed
after she got off her flight.

639
00:41:44,278 --> 00:41:47,615
By the time she got to us,
she was barely breathing.

640
00:41:47,698 --> 00:41:51,452
- Pressure 60 over 40.
- Dilated pupils, rapid pulse.

641
00:41:51,535 --> 00:41:53,996
I knew she'd overdosed on cocaine...

642
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:57,792
but she had no residue on her nostrils,
no injection marks.

643
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:02,004
We did everything we could.

644
00:42:03,088 --> 00:42:04,715
She died in the ER.

645
00:42:07,092 --> 00:42:08,886
We tried to save the baby...

646
00:42:14,391 --> 00:42:16,435
The baby died in my hands.

647
00:42:19,188 --> 00:42:20,690
I'm so sorry.

648
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,443
She was body-packing
11 ounces of cocaine.

649
00:42:25,361 --> 00:42:27,070
Two of the pellets split open.

650
00:42:28,947 --> 00:42:32,618
Twelve grams in her bloodstream.

651
00:42:34,912 --> 00:42:36,622
No one survives that.

652
00:42:44,254 --> 00:42:47,675
Why won't Pablo ever see me?

653
00:42:47,758 --> 00:42:51,470
I spent all this time
waiting around for him.

654
00:42:51,554 --> 00:42:53,723
Tell me something, Cockroach.

655
00:42:53,806 --> 00:42:56,433
Did you ever think
you were going to have this much money?

656
00:42:56,517 --> 00:43:00,020
Fuck the money.
I'm talking renegotiation.

657
00:43:00,103 --> 00:43:05,067
If it wasn't for me, you two
would still be smuggling cigarettes.

658
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:06,944
Let me give you a piece of advice.

659
00:43:08,529 --> 00:43:10,406
Never say that to Pablo.

660
00:43:11,281 --> 00:43:13,492
He's not as forgiving as I am.

661
00:43:19,498 --> 00:43:21,584
Pablo was fucking Cockroach over.

662
00:43:21,792 --> 00:43:25,045
But Cockroach
should've listened to Gustavo.

663
00:43:25,128 --> 00:43:28,966
Instead, he found another way
to get his fair share.

664
00:43:31,761 --> 00:43:34,388
Stop!

665
00:43:44,774 --> 00:43:46,859
What do you have in the spare tires?

666
00:43:49,653 --> 00:43:53,031
390 kilos, Pablo. We lost it.

667
00:43:54,116 --> 00:43:57,369
Gustavo, what do you mean
"we lost it"?

668
00:43:57,453 --> 00:43:59,329
Just what I said, we lost it.

669
00:44:00,414 --> 00:44:05,544
We lost it? It just disappeared?
Into thin air or what?

670
00:44:05,628 --> 00:44:08,672
Don't mess with me, Pablo.
We lost it.

671
00:44:08,756 --> 00:44:12,050
It looks like the cops must have stopped
the guys when they were leaving Ipsalia.

672
00:44:13,343 --> 00:44:14,470
Look...

673
00:44:15,471 --> 00:44:20,768
we've paid every cop
from here to Ipsalia.

674
00:44:22,728 --> 00:44:24,772
So how did we lose a load, brother?

675
00:44:24,855 --> 00:44:28,233
It looks like Colonel Herrera
suddenly turned honest.

676
00:44:28,317 --> 00:44:29,819
Know what I mean?

677
00:44:35,491 --> 00:44:37,159
And how much is he asking?

678
00:44:38,368 --> 00:44:39,745
Too much.

679
00:44:45,793 --> 00:44:47,294
What are you going to do?

680
00:44:48,629 --> 00:44:50,006
Come back, Pablo.

681
00:44:51,507 --> 00:44:54,426
Don't go and risk it for this asshole.
Come back.

682
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:56,178
Where are you going, Pablo?

683
00:44:56,887 --> 00:44:58,138
Pablo?

684
00:45:48,856 --> 00:45:50,273
What's going on, brother?

685
00:45:52,275 --> 00:45:53,610
Mr. Escobar...

686
00:45:54,987 --> 00:45:57,990
- we need to renegotiate.
- Eat shit.

687
00:46:02,828 --> 00:46:05,622
Eat. Shit.

688
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:10,210
What if I shot you in the head?

689
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:28,311
Are you sure about this, Colonel?

690
00:46:30,814 --> 00:46:33,776
He hasn't stopped laughing
since we arrested him.

691
00:46:33,859 --> 00:46:38,196
We're DAS, Ibarra.

692
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:40,240
What's that faggot gonna do?

693
00:46:43,786 --> 00:46:45,245
There we are.

694
00:46:45,328 --> 00:46:47,123
No, lower, lower.

695
00:46:47,205 --> 00:46:48,540
No that low.

696
00:46:51,085 --> 00:46:52,711
Ready.

697
00:46:57,174 --> 00:46:59,176
Another one, another one.
I'm ready.

698
00:47:03,346 --> 00:47:05,849
Pablo didn't know it then...

699
00:47:05,933 --> 00:47:09,686
but this mug shot was gonna cause him
a lot of grief down the line.

700
00:47:13,356 --> 00:47:15,651
Remove the handcuffs.

701
00:47:20,906 --> 00:47:22,491
You can go now, officer.

702
00:47:23,951 --> 00:47:25,494
Sit down, Mr. Pablo.

703
00:47:31,834 --> 00:47:34,628
We counted more than 300 kilos
in those trucks.

704
00:47:36,546 --> 00:47:41,551
That's a street value
of over four million dollars, Mr. Escobar.

705
00:47:42,302 --> 00:47:44,721
And you only gave us $150,000.

706
00:47:46,264 --> 00:47:48,851
Well, that's what we agreed upon.

707
00:47:49,810 --> 00:47:51,895
You know something?

708
00:47:51,979 --> 00:47:55,024
I make deals for a living.

709
00:47:55,107 --> 00:48:00,154
Now you can either accept my deal
or accept the consequences. You decide.

710
00:48:03,866 --> 00:48:07,036
Or we can renegotiate,
come to an agreement,

711
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:09,663
and everyone goes home happy.

712
00:48:12,208 --> 00:48:13,333
Deal?

713
00:48:21,508 --> 00:48:23,886
I'll give you one million dollars...

714
00:48:25,387 --> 00:48:27,472
under one condition.

715
00:48:29,099 --> 00:48:30,392
What is it?

716
00:48:32,477 --> 00:48:36,356
Someone in my organization
gave you the street value of my cocaine.

717
00:48:37,524 --> 00:48:39,735
Otherwise, how would you know?

718
00:48:43,572 --> 00:48:45,657
Give me a name...

719
00:48:47,868 --> 00:48:51,038
and you won't have
to split the cash with him.

720
00:48:54,791 --> 00:48:58,170
Turns out Cockroach was a real cockroach.

721
00:48:58,254 --> 00:49:01,423
Not only did he sell Pablo
to the authorities,

722
00:49:01,506 --> 00:49:05,177
he was stealing from him all along
and selling his coke in Miami, too.

723
00:49:07,221 --> 00:49:12,475
Cockroach's dealer was Germán Zapata,
a Colombian with a plumbing business

724
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:15,271
that served as a front
for his cocaine operation.

725
00:49:16,438 --> 00:49:21,193
He had 1200 keys in the van...
and guess who was buying the load?

726
00:49:24,487 --> 00:49:26,073
The plan was to trade vehicles,

727
00:49:26,156 --> 00:49:29,243
and Zapata would be arrested
once he left the port.

728
00:49:30,869 --> 00:49:33,455
1200 kilos.

729
00:49:33,538 --> 00:49:36,374
That would get us
on the cover of the Miami Herald.

730
00:49:37,459 --> 00:49:39,962
OK, gringos.

731
00:49:40,045 --> 00:49:42,047
How's the plumbing business?

732
00:49:42,131 --> 00:49:43,465
Fine.

733
00:49:46,927 --> 00:49:49,930
- How's it look?
- Plumbing business is very good.

734
00:49:51,723 --> 00:49:53,850
Come on, amigo. I'll show you.

735
00:49:55,435 --> 00:49:56,979
Everything was going perfect.

736
00:49:57,187 --> 00:50:02,067
Like I said, amigo...
100 percent pure.

737
00:50:02,151 --> 00:50:04,069
Except that Pablo was onto Cockroach.

738
00:50:04,153 --> 00:50:06,822
Got a full load here, Murph...

739
00:50:14,412 --> 00:50:17,040
Don't move! Don't move.

740
00:50:17,124 --> 00:50:20,252
Don't move! Don't move.

741
00:50:20,336 --> 00:50:21,628
Get down!

742
00:50:25,048 --> 00:50:27,384
Hands! Down!

743
00:50:27,467 --> 00:50:28,551
Don't look at me.

744
00:50:32,055 --> 00:50:33,265
Fucking...

745
00:50:52,868 --> 00:50:57,414
In the case of
the State of Florida v. Juan Diego Díaz,

746
00:50:57,497 --> 00:51:00,625
after taking into account
all due considerations,

747
00:51:00,709 --> 00:51:05,922
bail has been set at two million dollars,
or a bond of $200,000.

748
00:51:07,257 --> 00:51:10,593
I got to the courthouse early
the day of La Quica's trial.

749
00:51:10,677 --> 00:51:13,763
My testimony was gonna
put that bastard on death row.

750
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:19,436
The US District Attorney said La Quica
met his bail of two million dollars,

751
00:51:19,519 --> 00:51:24,233
paid by a wire transfer from, well...
why don't you take a guess?

752
00:51:25,483 --> 00:51:28,778
La Quica boarded
and was back in Medellín by midnight.

753
00:51:31,573 --> 00:51:37,913
From '79 to '84,
there were 3,245 murders in Miami.

754
00:51:38,997 --> 00:51:41,208
And outside the Tourist Bureau
and the cops,

755
00:51:41,417 --> 00:51:43,710
no one much cared about that.

756
00:51:43,919 --> 00:51:48,257
What got the US government
to take notice was the money.

757
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:52,886
Billions of dollars a year,
all flowing from the US to Colombia.

758
00:51:53,887 --> 00:51:56,973
And that... America couldn't take.

759
00:51:58,558 --> 00:52:02,812
A group of powerful businessmen
went and met with President Reagan.

760
00:52:03,021 --> 00:52:07,067
They were terrified the narco economy
would sink the real economy of Miami.

761
00:52:07,984 --> 00:52:12,448
Or... maybe they were pissed off
that they weren't getting a cut.

762
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:15,951
Whatever it was, the businessmen
came at just the right time.

763
00:52:16,659 --> 00:52:18,870
It's back-to-school time
for America's children...

764
00:52:18,954 --> 00:52:22,332
It was time for America
to suit up against a new enemy.

765
00:52:23,166 --> 00:52:25,585
Drugs are menacing our society.

766
00:52:25,668 --> 00:52:29,214
They're threatening our values
and undercutting our institutions.

767
00:52:29,298 --> 00:52:31,383
They're killing our children.

768
00:52:31,467 --> 00:52:33,260
It was classic Reagan.

769
00:52:33,343 --> 00:52:36,263
Folksy, direct and tough.

770
00:52:36,346 --> 00:52:39,599
He vowed to go after drugs
at the source.

771
00:52:39,808 --> 00:52:42,018
But it was Nancy who stole the show.

772
00:52:42,102 --> 00:52:46,315
So to my young friends out there,
life can be great.

773
00:52:46,398 --> 00:52:48,525
But not when you can't see it.

774
00:52:48,608 --> 00:52:53,822
So open your eyes to life, to see it
in the vivid colors that God gave us

775
00:52:53,905 --> 00:52:56,199
as a precious gift to His children.

776
00:52:56,283 --> 00:52:58,285
Say yes to your life.

777
00:52:58,368 --> 00:53:02,664
And when it comes to drugs and alcohol...
just say no.

778
00:53:02,747 --> 00:53:05,208
No, no, no! No, Pablo, no, no!

779
00:53:05,292 --> 00:53:06,376
No, no!

780
00:53:11,006 --> 00:53:14,384
They say when a nuclear holocaust
destroys the world,

781
00:53:14,468 --> 00:53:16,470
only the cockroaches will survive.

782
00:53:16,553 --> 00:53:18,680
Leave that piece of shit there.

783
00:53:18,763 --> 00:53:20,640
I guess they were wrong.

784
00:53:22,476 --> 00:53:25,687
During his career,
Pablo would kill over a thousand cops.

785
00:53:26,563 --> 00:53:28,482
But I wouldn't learn that till later.

786
00:53:33,069 --> 00:53:38,283
My dad volunteered to fight
in World War II because of Pearl Harbor.

787
00:53:38,492 --> 00:53:40,536
But you think he knew anybody in Hawaii?

788
00:53:41,495 --> 00:53:42,954
No way.

789
00:53:43,621 --> 00:53:48,168
He was a West Virginia farm boy,
but these fuckers stepped on our soil.

790
00:53:49,127 --> 00:53:51,963
So he laced up his army boots
and went to fight.

791
00:53:53,006 --> 00:53:54,508
It was his duty.

792
00:53:56,176 --> 00:53:58,303
Cocaine in Miami?

793
00:53:58,387 --> 00:54:00,305
Kilos from Colombia?

794
00:54:01,390 --> 00:54:03,683
This was my war.

795
00:54:03,766 --> 00:54:06,269
This was my duty.

796
00:54:06,353 --> 00:54:08,146
And I was ready to fight it.

797
00:54:08,230 --> 00:54:10,815
And my wife was ready
to fight it with me, too.

798
00:54:10,899 --> 00:54:12,108
Your ticket, please.

799
00:54:13,485 --> 00:54:14,652
OK.

800
00:54:14,736 --> 00:54:17,739
We had no idea
what we were in for.

801
00:54:19,115 --> 00:54:23,412
One year later... all that patriotic
bullshit was right out the window.

802
00:54:23,495 --> 00:54:25,163
OK, man, what do we got?

803
00:54:25,247 --> 00:54:28,375
- We got Poison...
- Excellent. Who else?

804
00:54:28,458 --> 00:54:29,792
We got Lizard.

805
00:54:30,919 --> 00:54:32,670
Uh...

806
00:54:32,754 --> 00:54:34,172
We got, we got...

807
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:39,886
- Big Badmouth.
- That motherfucker.

808
00:54:39,969 --> 00:54:42,639
- Thank you for the gift, agent.
- No problem.

809
00:54:58,780 --> 00:55:02,325
If there's one thing
I've learned in the narco world,

810
00:55:02,409 --> 00:55:05,412
it's that life is more complicated
than you think.

811
00:55:06,455 --> 00:55:10,125
Good and bad...
they're relative concepts.

812
00:55:11,418 --> 00:55:15,297
In the world of drug dealers,
you do what you think is right...

813
00:55:16,214 --> 00:55:18,258
and hope for the best.

814
00:55:19,384 --> 00:55:21,970
Look at what happened, boss.

815
00:55:22,053 --> 00:55:24,389
They killed Poison at La Dispensaria.

816
00:55:27,225 --> 00:55:30,270
- Who did it?
- I think it was Carrillo.

817
00:55:30,353 --> 00:55:33,482
And there was a gringo DEA agent
taking pictures.

818
00:55:37,569 --> 00:55:40,238
- Raise the bounty.
- On Carrillo, sir?

819
00:55:42,491 --> 00:55:46,119
I'll pay half a million
for the head of a DEA agent.

820
00:55:46,202 --> 00:55:47,663
Half a million?

821
00:55:47,745 --> 00:55:48,955
Do it.

822
00:55:49,038 --> 00:55:50,540
As you wish, sir.

823
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,797
Fucking gringos.

823
00:55:58,305 --> 00:56:04,921
