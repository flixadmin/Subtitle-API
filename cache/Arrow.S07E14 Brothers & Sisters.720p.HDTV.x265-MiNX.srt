Previously on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:01,062 --> 00:00:02,669
There was a fire in the apartment.

3
00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:03,921
Your mom was in there.

4
00:00:03,946 --> 00:00:05,218
It wasn't the fire that killed her.

5
00:00:05,295 --> 00:00:06,851
Your mission is about revenge.

6
00:00:06,923 --> 00:00:08,550
- Dante's a person.
- He is the financier

7
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:10,093
behind dozens of terrorist attacks.

8
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:11,886
Deputy Director Bell.

9
00:00:11,928 --> 00:00:14,055
We're in the process of
reinstating the ghost initiative.

10
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:16,558
Restoring the program is the
only way we can get Dante

11
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:18,309
without A.R.G.U.S. Oversight.

12
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:20,353
We were able to backtrace
the number Diaz called.

13
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:22,230
It belongs to Dante's contact Virgil.

14
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,107
Blackstar's our only lead
on finding those bombs.

15
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:26,985
Felicity's still alive.

16
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:29,696
You're not gonna shoot me.

17
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:31,197
My name is Mia Smoak.

18
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:32,657
I'm Felicity's daughter

19
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:33,825
and your sister.

20
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm coming, I'm coming!

21
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,171
Where are you? I can't find you!

22
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:51,259
Oh, oh, aah!

23
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:54,220
I'll always find you...

24
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:56,806
Both of you.

25
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:58,600
You stay away from me.

26
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:00,393
You stay away from me and my family!

27
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:05,440
You can't protect your baby.

00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,746
William, it's your dad again,

31
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,998
and I don't know if you're
getting my messages, buddy,

32
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,459
because you're not returning my calls.

33
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,419
I tried... I tried calling the house.

34
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:27,942
Look. I know that I'm not
your grandparents' favorite,

35
00:01:27,981 --> 00:01:29,653
but Felicity and I, we just want to know

36
00:01:29,762 --> 00:01:31,926
how you're settling in, and we
would love to hear your voice

37
00:01:31,992 --> 00:01:32,864
because we really miss y...

38
00:01:32,889 --> 00:01:35,058
The mailbox is now full. Good-bye.

39
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:38,056
He's still not answering your calls.

40
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,557
No.

41
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,143
Zoe froze me out when I first lost custody.

42
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:44,187
Don't worry. He'll come around.

43
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,231
You just got to be patient.

44
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,525
Patience is not really my thing, Rene,

45
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:51,486
but thank you.

46
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:54,239
Any word on when Dinah is coming back?

47
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,407
Well, she's already tried to check herself

48
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,535
out the hospital a couple of times.

49
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:01,746
Patience is also not really her thing.

50
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,249
- Working a new case?
- Not exactly.

51
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,251
It's for your sister. Yeah.

52
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:07,836
That's still weird to say out loud.

53
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:09,045
Ok, Rene, look.

54
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:10,880
Our team has been deputized

55
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:12,715
to work with the SCPD.

56
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:15,260
She hasn't been. She shouldn't be out there

57
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:18,680
as a vigilante, and I would
actually really appreciate

58
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:20,265
if you didn't encourage her.

59
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,225
Do you really think I could stop her?

60
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:23,852
Stubbornness runs in the family.

61
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:26,646
Besides, this is personal.

62
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:29,941
Why?

63
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,694
This is the bullet that killed her mother.

64
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:36,906
Her mother was murdered?

65
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,992
- She didn't tell you?
- No.

66
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:40,743
Look. I'm not trying to get in
the middle of any family drama.

67
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:42,287
Too late.

68
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,791
Her mother was murdered over a year ago.

69
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,668
- Ohh.
- Emiko's been trying to find

70
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,295
the killer ever since,

71
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:52,672
but all she's found were dead ends.

72
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,924
This bullet is her only legit lead.

73
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,759
Does she have any reason to blame my family

74
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:58,303
for her mother's death?

75
00:02:58,344 --> 00:02:59,754
Y'all did become Starling City royalty

76
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:01,919
while she and her mom were
left to struggle in the Glades.

77
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:03,927
All I'm saying is there's a difference

78
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,102
between trust and trust fund.

79
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:08,104
- She trusts you?
- That's because I had to prove

80
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:10,732
to her that she could.

81
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:13,943
Ok. I'll prove it, too.

82
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:24,120
Just like my father taught me.

83
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:26,706
He should have taught you how to aim, boy.

84
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,124
You'd be lucky to break skin.

85
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,834
Do you two ever stop talking?

86
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:44,098
Oops.

87
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,851
That is enough.
You're supposed to be training,

88
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,353
not trying to kill each other.

89
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:51,147
Aww. Why you
got to ruin all the fun?

90
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:56,402
The op in Cairo was a bust.

91
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:59,072
Dante's emissary Virgil
managed to evade us.

92
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:01,741
Virgil was our only contact to Dante.

93
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,785
All that effort to trick Diaz
into giving up the number,

94
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:05,411
and we're back to square one.

95
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:06,130
Not completely.

96
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,926
We still have the records
from Virgil's phone.

97
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:09,958
That could lead us to Dante.

98
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:12,335
Meantime, Dante is wreaking havoc,

99
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,003
financing terrorists all over the world.

100
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:15,922
I was hoping to be done
with this group by now.

101
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,632
I know. The only thing anyone
knows about this operation

102
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:20,051
is that Diaz is a part
of the ghost initiative,

103
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,178
but the longer this takes, the more likely

104
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,055
A.R.G.U.S. Brass is to
find out the real reason

105
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:27,600
for the ghost initiative
is to go after Dante.

106
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:30,520
It's time to tell Oliver and Felicity.

107
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:33,815
Our position now is riskier than ever.

108
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:36,901
The less secrets we have, the better.

109
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:42,615
My sister?

110
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,288
No. That's not possible.

111
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:51,708
I wish it wasn't, but here I am.

112
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:53,459
Now, get the damn gun off me.

113
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:55,420
He will when you stop lying.

114
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:56,921
It just doesn't make any sense.

115
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,840
We all knew Oliver and Felicity.

116
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:00,000
They never had a daughter.

117
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,842
They never had a daughter.

118
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:03,052
Guess you didn't know
them as well as you think.

119
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,263
Is this true? Is she their kid?

120
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,764
Hey. Whoa. Let him go.

121
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,057
He doesn't know who my parents are.

122
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,642
I never told him.

123
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,646
She's telling the truth.

124
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:17,442
Look, Mia,

125
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:21,904
Mia, my dad told me to keep a watch on you

126
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:23,865
and keep you safe,

127
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:26,576
so I know who your father is.

128
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:28,619
Your dad knew, too?

129
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,330
Who the hell is your dad?

130
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:33,333
John Diggle is my adoptive father.

131
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:35,168
- A vigilante.
- Mia...

132
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:38,629
So you've been lying
to me this entire time?

133
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,882
Well, now that we're all acquainted,

134
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:43,092
what the hell are you doing down here?

135
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,719
She's looking for Felicity,

136
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,554
who's apparently not dead.

137
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,139
How do you know?

138
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,974
Because she's done this before.

139
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,560
She's just hiding somewhere,
being paranoid like always.

140
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,397
Figured it might be here this time.

141
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,274
So you're just
going on a hunch, huh?

142
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,318
No. I am going on an entire lifetime

143
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,861
of dealing with her.

144
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,654
Did you even bother
checking into her murder?

145
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:04,989
Of course we did.

146
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,657
She died in an explosion.

147
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:09,494
Did you actually see a body?

148
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:14,707
Ok. So where do we start?

149
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:18,961
Yeah. I'm not looking for any
kind of family reunion here, bro.

150
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:22,173
Oh, I'm sorry, sis, but I have come too far

151
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:25,218
to get sidelined now,
so we're helping each other

152
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,303
whether you want to or not.

153
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:34,769
The ghost initiative sounds
a lot like Task Force X.

154
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,438
Didn't Lyla shelve that years ago?

155
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,023
She did, but there's now

156
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,150
a more immediate, more dangerous target

157
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:43,986
that the brass at
A.R.G.U.S., even above Lyla,

158
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:46,072
is preventing us from pursuing.

159
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,740
We're using the ghost initiative

160
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,367
to go after this target

161
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,202
without their oversight.

162
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,829
Well, I love a spontaneous OTA moment

163
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,539
as much as the next person,

164
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,749
but you didn't really come here to tell us

165
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,335
about resurrecting an old A.R.G.U.S.
Defunct program, did you?

166
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:01,379
It's not about the program.

167
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:04,340
It's about who's in it.

168
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:06,884
- Ricardo Diaz.
- Ohh.

169
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,553
You have to be joking.

170
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,388
You're working with the man who threatened

171
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,765
and tried to kill my entire family?

172
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,934
I think it's important that we
hear what John has to say.

173
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:18,646
Working with this monster
is a small price to pay

174
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:21,566
for bringing down a much larger threat.

175
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:24,235
Diaz was the only one we could
use to get close to this guy,

176
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:27,155
and I promise you he is
a million times worse.

177
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:29,574
So Diaz is just walking around
free right now in exchange for intel?

178
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:32,827
He's not free, Felicity.
He has a bomb in his head.

179
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,370
If he makes one misstep...

180
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,624
We are taking every precaution.

181
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,501
Well, I understand why Curtis left.

182
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,794
Hey.

183
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:43,963
You can't really be ok with this.

184
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:47,592
No, but I... I trust John,

185
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,386
and I believe

186
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,763
that he would only take a step like this

187
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,807
if he had no other choice.

188
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,559
There was no other choice,

189
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,978
and I hate that it came to this,

190
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,022
but Lyla and I believe that using

191
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:03,733
the ghost initiative is the best
way to take down this threat.

192
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:05,985
You realize that this is
the second time you have

193
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:08,571
prioritized your job over
keeping your friends safe?

194
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,656
Working with A.R.G.U.S. Does keep you safe

195
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:13,159
because it makes the world safe.

196
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,952
You can keep telling
yourself that.

197
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:31,902
Meet Virgil, an intermediary

198
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:33,737
for the terrorist financier
known as Dante.

199
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:36,309
- Diaz should be familiar.
- Nice guy.

200
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,200
Your job is to meet with Virgil,

201
00:08:39,233 --> 00:08:41,769
convince him that he should
be in business with you.

202
00:08:41,792 --> 00:08:44,419
You get through Virgil,
you get a meeting with Dante.

203
00:08:44,461 --> 00:08:46,129
So our first mission is a meeting?

204
00:08:46,171 --> 00:08:48,090
That is way below our pay grade.

205
00:08:48,131 --> 00:08:50,384
Wait. We're getting paid?

206
00:08:50,425 --> 00:08:52,552
If we can even get the meeting.

207
00:08:52,594 --> 00:08:54,805
I tried once. Virgil
wouldn't take my call.

208
00:08:54,846 --> 00:08:56,390
He wouldn't take yours,

209
00:08:56,431 --> 00:08:58,016
but he'll take his.

210
00:08:58,058 --> 00:09:00,018
Diaz is the reason we've
been able to track Virgil.

211
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,312
So what do you say, Diaz?

212
00:09:02,354 --> 00:09:04,272
You want to make that call
for real this time?

213
00:09:04,314 --> 00:09:06,817
I thought you'd never ask.

214
00:09:08,485 --> 00:09:10,654
Ok. Operation blow the
head off the dragon

215
00:09:10,695 --> 00:09:11,777
is officially a go.

216
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:13,345
I overrode A.R.G.U.S.'s security protocols

217
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:15,539
and accessed the bomb in Diaz's brain,

218
00:09:15,595 --> 00:09:19,891
which means as soon as dig's ghost
initiative mission is over, one click.

219
00:09:19,988 --> 00:09:21,406
Boom!

220
00:09:21,448 --> 00:09:23,200
That's great.

221
00:09:23,241 --> 00:09:24,993
- High score on candy crush?
- I'm working.

222
00:09:25,035 --> 00:09:27,037
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
that being a fake lawyer

223
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:28,747
was more interesting than getting revenge

224
00:09:28,789 --> 00:09:31,249
on the bastard who killed Quentin.

225
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:33,502
Fine. I'm listening. Happy?

226
00:09:33,543 --> 00:09:36,505
All you have to do is get
within 100 feet of Diaz,

227
00:09:36,546 --> 00:09:38,423
which should be easy for the D.A.,

228
00:09:38,465 --> 00:09:41,500
and then just click this button right here

229
00:09:41,684 --> 00:09:42,852
and activate the remote detonator.

230
00:09:44,479 --> 00:09:46,397
Won't that send me straight to the top

231
00:09:46,439 --> 00:09:48,316
of most likely to have killed Diaz list?

232
00:09:48,357 --> 00:09:49,984
Heh. What do you care?

233
00:09:50,026 --> 00:09:51,861
You've been trying to kill Diaz for months.

234
00:09:51,903 --> 00:09:53,529
I mean, the only reason he's still alive

235
00:09:53,571 --> 00:09:55,823
is because we needed him
to get Oliver out of prison.

236
00:09:55,865 --> 00:09:58,185
True... But some
things have changed.

237
00:09:58,185 --> 00:09:59,243
True... But some
things have changed.

238
00:09:59,285 --> 00:10:01,537
I mean, I'm kind of
good at this D.A. Thing,

239
00:10:01,579 --> 00:10:04,582
so I'm not really sure I'm
ready to give it up yet.

240
00:10:04,624 --> 00:10:06,417
Well, I'm not ready to
give up on getting Diaz.

241
00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:09,253
Diaz is in A.R.G.U.S. Custody.

242
00:10:09,295 --> 00:10:11,130
He's not running around free.

243
00:10:11,172 --> 00:10:14,050
Trust me. I would be thrilled
to see his head explode,

244
00:10:14,091 --> 00:10:15,635
but is it really worth the consequences?

245
00:10:15,676 --> 00:10:17,136
Yes, it is worth every consequence.

246
00:10:17,178 --> 00:10:19,597
I have to protect my family.

247
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:22,558
By family you mean you, Oliver,

248
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,478
and your baby?

249
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,522
What, are you psychic now?

250
00:10:27,563 --> 00:10:29,398
Well, there's no wine or champagne

251
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,858
and no caffeine on this mission,

252
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,944
and that... that is a pregnant lady

253
00:10:32,985 --> 00:10:34,737
amount of chocolates you just consumed.

254
00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:36,948
I ate that much chocolate
before I was pregnant.

255
00:10:40,952 --> 00:10:42,787
- No one else knows.
- Not even Oliver?

256
00:10:42,829 --> 00:10:44,872
I haven't found the
right time to tell him.

257
00:10:44,914 --> 00:10:46,749
I've been trying to tell him, so I
would really, really appreciate it

258
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:48,376
if you wouldn't tell...

259
00:10:48,417 --> 00:10:50,044
Anyone.

260
00:10:50,086 --> 00:10:51,963
I won't.

261
00:10:52,004 --> 00:10:53,464
I promise.

262
00:11:03,432 --> 00:11:06,310
Really snap your wrist next time.

263
00:11:06,352 --> 00:11:08,688
Gives it just a bit more power.

264
00:11:08,729 --> 00:11:10,565
How the hell did you get in here?

265
00:11:10,606 --> 00:11:13,568
I have something for you.

266
00:11:13,609 --> 00:11:15,611
- Of course Rene told you.
- Don't get mad at Rene.

267
00:11:15,653 --> 00:11:17,989
I just... I want to help.

268
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:20,491
I had Felicity analyze the
composition of the bullet.

269
00:11:20,533 --> 00:11:23,077
- It's made from a...
- A rare promethium alloy,

270
00:11:23,119 --> 00:11:26,873
the kind used by a handful of black
market weapons manufacturers?

271
00:11:26,914 --> 00:11:28,624
I've done my homework.

272
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:30,418
Do you know it was shot
with a customized rifle?

273
00:11:32,837 --> 00:11:34,797
Specs are on the drive.

274
00:11:40,052 --> 00:11:41,721
Thanks.

275
00:11:41,762 --> 00:11:43,431
I can help you catch who made it.

276
00:11:43,472 --> 00:11:45,308
This is my mission.

277
00:11:45,349 --> 00:11:49,437
Ok. Maybe we can discuss your mother.

278
00:11:49,478 --> 00:11:51,314
Rene has a big mouth.

279
00:11:51,355 --> 00:11:54,025
I'm glad he told me, ok?

280
00:11:54,066 --> 00:11:56,277
I know what it's like to lose a parent.

281
00:11:56,319 --> 00:11:58,654
I don't want your sympathy.

282
00:12:03,075 --> 00:12:04,660
I want justice.

283
00:12:04,702 --> 00:12:06,078
Except you're not authorized to get it.

284
00:12:08,289 --> 00:12:10,833
I am.

285
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:13,836
Why should I trust you?

286
00:12:13,878 --> 00:12:17,924
I understand that my parents
weren't exactly the best people,

287
00:12:17,965 --> 00:12:21,344
but... if they taught me one thing,

288
00:12:21,385 --> 00:12:23,846
it's the value of family,

289
00:12:23,888 --> 00:12:28,267
which is what you and I are,

290
00:12:28,309 --> 00:12:31,479
so if someone's hurt you,

291
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,397
you better believe they've hurt me, too.

292
00:12:53,334 --> 00:12:56,128
I don't know how we're gonna use
this old stuff to find Felicity.

293
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:58,214
It's like a tech time capsule.

294
00:12:58,255 --> 00:13:00,466
Here goes nothing.

295
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,678
Whoa.

296
00:13:03,719 --> 00:13:05,721
And we have liftoff.

297
00:13:05,763 --> 00:13:07,556
I thought you had Archer.

298
00:13:07,598 --> 00:13:09,100
Why do you need all this old junk?

299
00:13:09,141 --> 00:13:10,768
Because as advanced as Archer is,

300
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:12,353
it was designed for the glades.

301
00:13:12,395 --> 00:13:13,729
This system was built for Star City.

302
00:13:13,771 --> 00:13:15,314
So who am I looking for again?

303
00:13:15,356 --> 00:13:17,441
Uh, some guy. Paul Loiseau.

304
00:13:17,483 --> 00:13:20,528
SCPD has him listed as the only eyewitness

305
00:13:20,569 --> 00:13:22,530
to Felicity's murder.

306
00:13:22,571 --> 00:13:24,782
I'm guessing she paid him
to say she was there.

307
00:13:24,824 --> 00:13:26,951
Says this guy committed
suicide about a week ago.

308
00:13:26,993 --> 00:13:29,912
Wait. That was right when we started
looking into Felicity's disappearance.

309
00:13:29,954 --> 00:13:31,747
What about the coroner?

310
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:36,002
Another suicide.

311
00:13:36,043 --> 00:13:38,129
Star city's bad but not that bad.

312
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:40,214
Someone's taking these
people out, but why?

313
00:13:40,256 --> 00:13:42,216
So Felicity uncovers a bomb plot,

314
00:13:42,258 --> 00:13:44,135
but before she can tell
anybody, the party responsible

315
00:13:44,176 --> 00:13:45,636
fakes her death.

316
00:13:45,678 --> 00:13:47,763
Now they're tying up loose ends.

317
00:13:47,805 --> 00:13:50,016
- So why not just kill her?
- Because they needed her.

318
00:13:50,057 --> 00:13:53,394
You were the last one to talk
to Felicity. What did she say?

319
00:13:53,436 --> 00:13:56,272
Just the usual bull about
how the city's not safe

320
00:13:56,313 --> 00:13:58,190
and she wanted me to get out of town.

321
00:13:58,232 --> 00:14:01,068
It might not have been bull this time.

322
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:03,696
You guys are just junkies
looking for your hero fix.

323
00:14:03,738 --> 00:14:06,073
My mom is the only person I care about,

324
00:14:06,115 --> 00:14:08,367
and I'm gonna go look for
her myself without any of you.

325
00:14:08,409 --> 00:14:10,661
- Hold on. Mia...
- Get the hell off!

326
00:14:10,703 --> 00:14:12,371
That goes for all of you.

327
00:14:21,213 --> 00:14:22,882
This is my kind of place.

328
00:14:22,923 --> 00:14:24,508
This used to be a triad hangout.

329
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,968
Everyone, focus.

330
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:28,054
The objective is to find Virgil

331
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,680
and get him to agree to your deal.

332
00:14:29,722 --> 00:14:31,265
Where is Virgil?

333
00:14:31,307 --> 00:14:33,017
Ah, speak of the devil,

334
00:14:33,059 --> 00:14:34,769
and he shall appear.

335
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,604
Ricardo Diaz,

336
00:14:36,645 --> 00:14:39,106
and here I thought the
almighty dragon was in prison.

337
00:14:39,148 --> 00:14:40,941
No prison could hold me.

338
00:14:40,983 --> 00:14:42,526
You should know that.

339
00:14:42,568 --> 00:14:44,070
No bodyguards. That's a good sign.

340
00:14:44,111 --> 00:14:46,197
Now all you have to do is convince him.

341
00:14:46,238 --> 00:14:48,115
You know, Mr. Diaz, I was, uh...

342
00:14:48,157 --> 00:14:50,534
I was happy to get your call.

343
00:14:50,576 --> 00:14:54,914
My employer would like to know
when he can collect on your debt.

344
00:14:54,955 --> 00:14:58,185
The longbow hunters were not cheap.

345
00:14:58,185 --> 00:14:58,334
The longbow hunters were not cheap.

346
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:01,003
We have a proposition,

347
00:15:01,045 --> 00:15:04,423
and I think it will cover
more than what I owe.

348
00:15:04,465 --> 00:15:05,800
That's intriguing.

349
00:15:08,928 --> 00:15:11,847
Too bad it wasn't made
in good faith, though.

350
00:15:14,809 --> 00:15:17,019
Kill them,

351
00:15:17,061 --> 00:15:19,230
except for Mr. Diaz.

352
00:15:19,271 --> 00:15:22,566
Dante will deal with him
personally tonight.

353
00:15:27,363 --> 00:15:29,490
Don't let Virgil leave!

354
00:15:51,053 --> 00:15:52,263
Unh!

355
00:15:54,056 --> 00:15:56,725
Great. Now we owe her one.

356
00:15:56,767 --> 00:15:57,977
Move!

357
00:16:10,322 --> 00:16:12,116
Nowhere to run, Virgil!

358
00:16:14,493 --> 00:16:17,705
Treachery earns the worst
punishment, Ricardo.

359
00:16:17,746 --> 00:16:20,249
Dante will make sure you
get what you deserve.

360
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:21,375
Ha ha ha!

361
00:16:30,777 --> 00:16:32,904
Are the handcuffs really necessary?

362
00:16:32,945 --> 00:16:34,822
Until you tell us which
one of you tipped off Virgil.

363
00:16:34,864 --> 00:16:36,365
Hey. We were
caught in the same ambush.

364
00:16:36,407 --> 00:16:37,950
In case you missed the show out there,

365
00:16:37,992 --> 00:16:39,577
we almost died.

366
00:16:39,619 --> 00:16:41,370
Well, some of us did.

367
00:16:41,412 --> 00:16:43,372
You got something you want to say to me?

368
00:16:43,414 --> 00:16:46,485
Maybe "Dante will deal with him personally"

369
00:16:46,486 --> 00:16:49,044
was actually code for "get Diaz out"

370
00:16:49,069 --> 00:16:50,612
before the bloodbath."

371
00:16:50,684 --> 00:16:52,436
- The phone call to Virgil.
- Mm-hmm.

372
00:16:52,477 --> 00:16:54,354
Diaz must have warned him somehow.

373
00:16:54,396 --> 00:16:56,565
I'll have the analysts
look into encoded phrases.

374
00:16:56,606 --> 00:16:58,984
Lady, you ain't gonna find anything

375
00:16:59,025 --> 00:17:00,610
because I wasn't the one who warned them.

376
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:02,237
Sure you didn't.

377
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:04,239
You didn't really think this one through.

378
00:17:04,281 --> 00:17:07,993
Even if you and Virgil had
ridden off into the sunset,

379
00:17:08,034 --> 00:17:10,871
mommy and daddy wouldn't
have let you get very far.

380
00:17:10,912 --> 00:17:12,873
He didn't think we would really do it.

381
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:19,546
You guys, you have no idea
who you're messing with.

382
00:17:19,588 --> 00:17:21,423
You're afraid.

383
00:17:21,465 --> 00:17:24,342
You'd rather have a bomb
explode in your head

384
00:17:24,384 --> 00:17:27,345
than risk Dante finding out
that you betrayed him.

385
00:17:27,387 --> 00:17:31,808
Once Dante figures all of this out...

386
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,644
And he will...

387
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:37,689
You all are gonna be wishing for
the mercy of a quick death.

388
00:17:41,443 --> 00:17:44,029
Laurel Lance
entering Queen residence.

389
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,530
No more sad chocolates.

390
00:17:45,572 --> 00:17:48,950
I got you a roasted Turkey sandwich.

391
00:17:48,992 --> 00:17:50,660
It's not deli meat. I double-checked.

392
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:53,830
Also, I got you some fruit and veggies.

393
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:55,665
Are you on any prenatal vitamins?

394
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:58,251
Any Mac and cheese in there? No?

395
00:17:58,293 --> 00:18:01,713
Clearly, you're having some
kind of weird pregnancy crisis,

396
00:18:01,755 --> 00:18:04,800
and killing Ricardo Diaz is
not going to solve it.

397
00:18:04,841 --> 00:18:07,302
Focusing on killing the maniac
who wants to kill me and my family

398
00:18:07,344 --> 00:18:11,932
might be a little bit more helpful
than... Eating that banana.

399
00:18:11,973 --> 00:18:14,726
One, you need the potassium.

400
00:18:14,768 --> 00:18:16,645
Two, yes, you're right.

401
00:18:16,686 --> 00:18:19,731
Your husband's job is to be
the enemy of monsters,

402
00:18:19,773 --> 00:18:22,692
and those monsters are going
to target you and your family

403
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:24,110
like they always have.

404
00:18:24,152 --> 00:18:26,947
Thank you. That is incredibly reassuring.

405
00:18:26,988 --> 00:18:28,865
You are more than capable

406
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:30,742
of protecting yourself and your family.

407
00:18:30,784 --> 00:18:35,330
I mean, you built this insane,
crazy security system.

408
00:18:35,372 --> 00:18:37,958
Which didn't work the last
time somebody targeted us.

409
00:18:37,999 --> 00:18:41,378
- So? You'll fix it.
- Yeah. Ok.

410
00:18:41,419 --> 00:18:45,757
In half a day, you hacked
into Ricardo Diaz's brain.

411
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:48,176
I don't know if you've noticed,

412
00:18:48,218 --> 00:18:50,136
but you're kind of a badass.

413
00:18:50,178 --> 00:18:52,264
What if it's not enough?

414
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:55,350
Look.

415
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,188
There will always be another Diaz.

416
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:02,649
- Oh.
- You just have to have faith

417
00:19:02,691 --> 00:19:05,110
that you can handle the next one

418
00:19:05,151 --> 00:19:09,573
and the one after that
and the one after that.

419
00:19:09,614 --> 00:19:12,909
You know, this baby's
really lucky to have you.

420
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:15,078
I know it's scary,

421
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,497
but I promise you've got this,

422
00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:19,791
and if you want to kill Ricardo Diaz,

423
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:21,918
I am not gonna stand in your way,

424
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,422
but don't do it out of fear

425
00:19:25,463 --> 00:19:27,591
because you have
nothing to be afraid of.

426
00:19:34,681 --> 00:19:36,808
We just finished the
analysis of the phone call

427
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:38,351
between Diaz and Virgil.

428
00:19:38,393 --> 00:19:40,645
No obvious ciphers or patterns.

429
00:19:40,687 --> 00:19:42,689
Ok. Well, if Diaz was telling the truth,

430
00:19:42,731 --> 00:19:44,691
then Virgil must have been
tipped off by someone else.

431
00:19:44,733 --> 00:19:46,860
Probably the same someone who's
been locking us in A.R.G.U.S.,

432
00:19:46,902 --> 00:19:48,445
and now they know we're
using the ghost initiative

433
00:19:48,486 --> 00:19:51,031
to go after Dante.

434
00:19:51,072 --> 00:19:54,534
We need to catch him before they
shut us down completely.

435
00:19:54,576 --> 00:19:55,712
Any luck figuring out his next move?

436
00:19:55,712 --> 00:19:56,995
Any luck figuring out his next move?

437
00:19:57,037 --> 00:19:58,872
Well, we did manage to find this.

438
00:19:58,914 --> 00:20:01,833
It's an Italian florin coin circa 1300s.

439
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,752
Wouldn't have pegged
Virgil as a coin collector.

440
00:20:03,793 --> 00:20:06,129
He wasn't. It's a fake.

441
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:09,257
Turns out there's a
microchip hidden inside.

442
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:11,051
Well, that sounds promising.

443
00:20:11,092 --> 00:20:13,762
Unfortunately, the data's
very heavily encrypted.

444
00:20:13,803 --> 00:20:16,473
I don't really trust giving it
to an A.R.G.U.S. Analyst,

445
00:20:16,514 --> 00:20:19,392
but Curtis did leave us his
decryption algorithm.

446
00:20:19,434 --> 00:20:20,936
Considerate of him.

447
00:20:20,977 --> 00:20:22,520
It's gonna take a while.

448
00:20:22,562 --> 00:20:24,481
Well, hopefully, not too long.

449
00:20:24,522 --> 00:20:26,900
If Dante's in town, it must
be for something big.

450
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:31,279
Um, the algorithm you
wrote to find the weapon

451
00:20:31,321 --> 00:20:33,073
is lagging a little bit.

452
00:20:33,114 --> 00:20:35,116
Do you... Mind if I take a look?

453
00:20:35,158 --> 00:20:37,577
The algorithm's fine.

454
00:20:37,619 --> 00:20:39,120
Ok.

455
00:20:40,747 --> 00:20:43,041
Do you have to stand right there?

456
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:49,464
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

457
00:20:49,506 --> 00:20:51,007
I had to help Zoe with her test.

458
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:53,176
Geometry's a bitch.

459
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:55,762
- How we looking?
- Fantastic.

460
00:20:55,804 --> 00:20:57,722
The weight on these feels a little strange.

461
00:20:57,764 --> 00:20:59,683
Did you make these yourself or...

462
00:20:59,724 --> 00:21:01,601
- No.
- I'm just asking because

463
00:21:01,643 --> 00:21:03,353
when I started out, I made
most of my own arrows,

464
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:06,272
and I could show you a
trick or two if you want.

465
00:21:06,314 --> 00:21:10,527
What I want is for you
to not touch my things.

466
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:14,906
And that's a hit! Ok.

467
00:21:14,948 --> 00:21:17,200
Andrew Thornton. Specializes

468
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:19,577
in promethium-based customized weaponry.

469
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:21,121
That sounds like our guy.

470
00:21:21,162 --> 00:21:22,747
Yeah. Now we just have to find him.

471
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:24,541
According to that online
chatter right there,

472
00:21:24,582 --> 00:21:26,292
he's doing a deal tonight

473
00:21:26,334 --> 00:21:28,378
at an industrial plant in Pennytown.

474
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,213
- Hmm.
- So what's the plan?

475
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:31,840
Rene's gonna roll with me,
and you need to stay here.

476
00:21:31,881 --> 00:21:33,341
No way. I'm not staying behind.

477
00:21:33,383 --> 00:21:35,135
You don't have a badge, ok?

478
00:21:35,176 --> 00:21:38,346
I'm sorry, but I promise you

479
00:21:38,388 --> 00:21:40,890
we will take care of this.

480
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:42,517
Let's go, Rene.

481
00:21:55,655 --> 00:21:58,658
Gentlemen, who's ready to do some business?

482
00:22:01,077 --> 00:22:03,913
Behold my masterpiece.

483
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:06,458
Fully customizable to your specifications.

484
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:11,671
- Unh!
- Ugh!

485
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,676
I'll handle Thornton!

486
00:22:16,718 --> 00:22:18,136
Copy that.

487
00:22:18,178 --> 00:22:20,263
Ugh!

488
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:21,806
Thornton's mine.

489
00:22:29,856 --> 00:22:31,816
Hey! What the hell
are you doing?

490
00:22:31,858 --> 00:22:33,359
Taking back my mission!

491
00:22:46,122 --> 00:22:47,582
There's two of you now?!

492
00:22:47,624 --> 00:22:49,209
You're gonna tell me everything you know

493
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:50,752
about the murder of Kazumi Adachi!

494
00:22:50,794 --> 00:22:53,213
Andrew Thornton, up against the wall!

495
00:22:53,254 --> 00:22:55,507
By the authority of the SCPD,
I am placing you under arrest.

496
00:22:55,548 --> 00:22:57,258
You have the right to remain silent.

497
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,427
What the hell are you doing?

498
00:22:59,469 --> 00:23:01,471
I'm taking him in for questioning.

499
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:03,264
No. This is my mission. I
need to question him my way!

500
00:23:03,306 --> 00:23:04,599
You'd be breaking the law,

501
00:23:04,641 --> 00:23:06,267
which you're already doing!

502
00:23:06,309 --> 00:23:09,437
There's a right way
and a wrong way to do this.

503
00:23:09,479 --> 00:23:11,064
The only thing I've done wrong

504
00:23:11,106 --> 00:23:12,982
is think that I could ever trust you.

505
00:23:26,699 --> 00:23:29,160
Hey. Thornton's ready to be questioned.

506
00:23:31,037 --> 00:23:33,665
Thought you'd be happier about that.

507
00:23:33,706 --> 00:23:36,459
Yeah. Sorry. I just... With Emiko.

508
00:23:36,501 --> 00:23:38,962
I need to make her understand
we're on the same side.

509
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,218
I think the problem is you thinking

510
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:47,345
you can make her do anything.

511
00:23:47,387 --> 00:23:49,472
Yeah. I've been doing this a long time.

512
00:23:49,514 --> 00:23:51,474
She's new, she's unsanctioned,

513
00:23:51,516 --> 00:23:53,601
and I'm trying to help her.

514
00:23:53,643 --> 00:23:55,353
But she didn't ask for your help.

515
00:23:55,395 --> 00:23:56,896
Imagine how you would feel

516
00:23:56,938 --> 00:23:58,857
if, when you first started your quest,

517
00:23:58,898 --> 00:24:00,525
someone had basically
ripped your father's list

518
00:24:00,567 --> 00:24:02,610
out of your hand and
taken over your mission.

519
00:24:04,737 --> 00:24:06,573
I see your point.

520
00:24:06,614 --> 00:24:08,158
Emiko doesn't need anybody telling her

521
00:24:08,199 --> 00:24:09,909
what to do or how to do it,

522
00:24:09,951 --> 00:24:12,412
and she definitely doesn't
need anyone's protection.

523
00:24:12,453 --> 00:24:14,080
You see that move she did with the bow

524
00:24:14,122 --> 00:24:15,915
and switched hands?

525
00:24:15,957 --> 00:24:17,125
Yeah. It's impressive.

526
00:24:17,167 --> 00:24:19,294
Ridiculous.

527
00:24:19,335 --> 00:24:22,130
Just be her brother

528
00:24:22,172 --> 00:24:24,299
if you want her to be in
your life and to trust you.

529
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:26,801
Just...

530
00:24:26,843 --> 00:24:29,012
Just be her brother.

531
00:24:42,942 --> 00:24:44,277
Hey!

532
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:47,238
It's just me... Your brother, apparently.

533
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,823
What, you think just because we're related

534
00:24:48,865 --> 00:24:50,325
I'm not gonna kick your ass out of here?

535
00:24:50,366 --> 00:24:52,118
That was the hope, yeah.

536
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,705
If you're here to convince me to join

537
00:24:53,705 --> 00:24:53,745
if you're here to convince me to join

538
00:24:53,786 --> 00:24:55,163
your little merry band of heroes,

539
00:24:55,205 --> 00:24:56,581
save your breath.

540
00:24:56,623 --> 00:24:58,082
Actually, I was just hoping that we could

541
00:24:58,124 --> 00:25:00,168
commiserate about how
much our parents suck.

542
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:01,920
I never had anyone to do that with before.

543
00:25:01,961 --> 00:25:04,255
What do you have against our parents?

544
00:25:04,297 --> 00:25:05,757
Seems like you came out all right.

545
00:25:05,798 --> 00:25:07,425
You're superrich.

546
00:25:07,467 --> 00:25:08,801
Well, let's see.

547
00:25:08,843 --> 00:25:10,678
Oliver, being my dad, got my mom killed.

548
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,514
Then he and Felicity
promised to stay in my life

549
00:25:13,556 --> 00:25:15,099
after my grandparents took custody,

550
00:25:15,141 --> 00:25:16,893
and then I never heard from them again,

551
00:25:16,935 --> 00:25:19,020
and my whole justification
for it, you know,

552
00:25:19,062 --> 00:25:22,941
that it's hard for publicly
recognized vigilantes to raise children,

553
00:25:22,982 --> 00:25:24,776
sort of went out the window
when I found out

554
00:25:24,817 --> 00:25:28,112
they actually had another kid,

555
00:25:28,154 --> 00:25:32,533
which means that they just didn't want me.

556
00:25:32,575 --> 00:25:34,994
Being the kid they wanted
wasn't so great either.

557
00:25:39,082 --> 00:25:41,334
If you hate Felicity so much,

558
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:44,879
why are you wasting all this time
trying to find out where she is?

559
00:25:44,921 --> 00:25:47,048
- Because of this.
- A rock?

560
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:48,925
Felicity gave it to me when I was a kid,

561
00:25:48,967 --> 00:25:51,636
and it's how she sent out
her distress signal...

562
00:25:51,678 --> 00:25:54,305
Now nearly two decades later.

563
00:25:54,347 --> 00:25:56,432
And you held onto it all this time.

564
00:25:56,474 --> 00:25:57,892
It's actually really sad.

565
00:25:57,934 --> 00:25:59,602
Thanks.

566
00:26:01,646 --> 00:26:04,816
You know, parents aren't perfect.

567
00:26:06,276 --> 00:26:08,528
They love us the best way they can.

568
00:26:08,569 --> 00:26:10,780
Ahh. Maybe I was just
trying to do the same.

569
00:26:10,822 --> 00:26:15,201
My whole life, my mom told
me that our dad was a hero,

570
00:26:15,243 --> 00:26:18,663
but everything in this
city says the opposite,

571
00:26:18,705 --> 00:26:22,041
that all of our problems
today are because of him

572
00:26:22,083 --> 00:26:24,002
and the other vigilantes.

573
00:26:26,879 --> 00:26:28,840
You knew him back then.

574
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,844
Was he a hero?

575
00:26:32,885 --> 00:26:34,679
Yeah, he really was,

576
00:26:34,721 --> 00:26:36,222
and, you know, I'm starting to think

577
00:26:36,264 --> 00:26:40,727
that this rock was
supposed to lead me to you.

578
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:44,856
Family was always the most
important thing to my...

579
00:26:44,897 --> 00:26:46,733
Our parents.

580
00:26:49,402 --> 00:26:52,864
Damn it, you are here to
just talk me into joining you.

581
00:26:52,905 --> 00:26:54,949
Well, did it work?

582
00:27:02,915 --> 00:27:04,876
We have a lead on Dante's location.

583
00:27:07,378 --> 00:27:10,298
- What's wrong?
- I got a call from the Pentagon.

584
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:13,468
They want me in front of the
joint chiefs tomorrow.

585
00:27:13,509 --> 00:27:16,095
They're going to ask for my resignation.

586
00:27:16,137 --> 00:27:18,264
Lyla, I'm so sorry. I should have never

587
00:27:18,306 --> 00:27:20,099
forced your hand with the ghost initiative.

588
00:27:20,141 --> 00:27:21,934
I backed that play with open eyes, Johnny,

589
00:27:21,976 --> 00:27:23,686
and I stand by it now.

590
00:27:23,728 --> 00:27:26,147
Still, I never thought it would
mean you losing your job.

591
00:27:26,189 --> 00:27:28,691
Then we better make it count.

592
00:27:28,733 --> 00:27:32,945
Dante is within our grasp, and we
may not have another chance.

593
00:27:32,987 --> 00:27:36,115
Now tell me about that lead.

594
00:27:36,157 --> 00:27:39,744
Well, Curtis' algorithm absolutely worked.

595
00:27:39,786 --> 00:27:41,913
According to the microchip in the coin,

596
00:27:41,954 --> 00:27:44,707
Virgil was using it as some
sort of storage device

597
00:27:44,749 --> 00:27:46,376
for all kinds of data,

598
00:27:46,417 --> 00:27:48,461
including a forged diplomatic credential

599
00:27:48,503 --> 00:27:50,338
from the Quraci embassy.

600
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:51,923
There's a delegation there tonight

601
00:27:51,964 --> 00:27:53,758
with a very interesting guest of honor...

602
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,593
Princess Noor Harjavti.

603
00:27:55,635 --> 00:27:57,303
Rumor has it

604
00:27:57,345 --> 00:27:59,347
Princess Noor is planning a revolution.

605
00:27:59,389 --> 00:28:02,600
So she needs Dante's money
to fund her palace coup,

606
00:28:02,642 --> 00:28:04,519
which may be the reason why he's in town...

607
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,104
To make the deal.

608
00:28:06,145 --> 00:28:08,314
We need to get into the embassy

609
00:28:08,356 --> 00:28:10,149
and stop that deal from
happening and nab Dante.

610
00:28:10,191 --> 00:28:11,692
Copy that. Only one problem.

611
00:28:11,734 --> 00:28:13,152
We have no idea how Dante looks.

612
00:28:13,194 --> 00:28:15,154
- We know somebody who does.
- Diaz.

613
00:28:16,989 --> 00:28:19,075
Which means we have to put
him back in the field.

614
00:28:19,117 --> 00:28:21,327
That's not our biggest problem.

615
00:28:21,369 --> 00:28:23,538
The ghost initiative is blown,

616
00:28:23,579 --> 00:28:25,331
and we can't rely on anyone at A.R.G.U.S.,

617
00:28:25,373 --> 00:28:27,333
and we cannot go in there without backup.

618
00:28:27,375 --> 00:28:29,085
Maybe we don't have to.

619
00:28:32,004 --> 00:28:34,257
Just got off the phone with John.

620
00:28:34,298 --> 00:28:35,842
He and Lyla are gearing up

621
00:28:35,883 --> 00:28:37,510
for a ghost initiative op.

622
00:28:37,552 --> 00:28:39,011
They asked me to be in the field.

623
00:28:39,053 --> 00:28:41,764
In the field with whom exactly?

624
00:28:41,806 --> 00:28:43,724
Diaz?

625
00:28:43,766 --> 00:28:45,268
I told John it was your decision.

626
00:28:45,309 --> 00:28:47,979
Whatever you decide after the mission,

627
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:51,107
I will back any move that you
want to make against Diaz.

628
00:28:51,149 --> 00:28:53,651
Oh, you don't mean that.

629
00:28:53,693 --> 00:28:55,570
You know what?

630
00:28:55,611 --> 00:28:58,781
I know why you've been acting
so strange lately, right?

631
00:28:58,823 --> 00:29:01,075
- You do?
- Yeah.

632
00:29:01,117 --> 00:29:02,994
I was gonna tell you.

633
00:29:03,035 --> 00:29:04,495
There's just been so much going on. I...

634
00:29:04,537 --> 00:29:05,163
You're planning to kill Diaz.

635
00:29:08,875 --> 00:29:12,795
Yeah. Uh, so I'm guessing
there is a speech coming.

636
00:29:12,837 --> 00:29:14,881
Felicity, I think there's a better way.

637
00:29:14,922 --> 00:29:17,633
I... I think that, but that's my choice.

638
00:29:22,513 --> 00:29:26,392
I have no right whatsoever to make yours.

639
00:29:26,434 --> 00:29:28,394
Right after I got out of Slabside,

640
00:29:28,436 --> 00:29:33,232
I... I didn't realize or totally understand

641
00:29:33,274 --> 00:29:36,819
the... the pain that you were dealing with.

642
00:29:36,861 --> 00:29:39,614
I just want you to get closure

643
00:29:39,655 --> 00:29:42,241
because I want us to be
able to move forward.

644
00:29:46,454 --> 00:29:49,081
I hope you change your mind,

645
00:29:49,123 --> 00:29:51,375
but if you don't,

646
00:29:51,417 --> 00:29:53,705
I swear I will not stand in your way.

647
00:29:53,705 --> 00:29:54,837
I swear I will not stand in your way.

648
00:29:54,879 --> 00:29:58,382
- Thank you.
- I have your back

649
00:29:58,424 --> 00:30:01,052
no matter what.

650
00:30:05,473 --> 00:30:07,350
Tell John you're coming on the mission.

651
00:30:10,311 --> 00:30:12,188
And so am I.

652
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:21,946
Harbinger's in position. Sitrep?

653
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:24,490
I count 11, 12 guards in this room alone.

654
00:30:24,532 --> 00:30:26,742
We have to move on Dante after the meet.

655
00:30:26,784 --> 00:30:29,328
Agreed. You copy that, Diaz?

656
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:31,122
Sure thing, boss.

657
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:33,249
Can't wait for you to meet Dante.

658
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:34,959
Joke all you want. Just remember,

659
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,962
we're only keeping you alive
so you can I.D. Dante.

660
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:40,339
After that, all bets are off.

661
00:30:40,381 --> 00:30:42,800
Overwatch, what's your status?

662
00:30:42,842 --> 00:30:45,344
The feed is live, but 5 of the cameras
are down in the southeast corridor.

663
00:30:45,386 --> 00:30:47,096
One guess as to why.

664
00:30:47,138 --> 00:30:48,597
That's where we'll find
Dante and the Princess.

665
00:30:48,639 --> 00:30:50,558
They don't want eyes on the exchange.

666
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:54,812
Hold on. What the hell is
Director Bell doing here?

667
00:30:54,854 --> 00:30:57,690
Son of a bitch. He's Dante's source.

668
00:30:57,731 --> 00:31:00,234
Looks like somebody owes me an apology.

669
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:04,071
The Princess is here.

670
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:08,909
Everyone head to the south corridor.

671
00:31:20,463 --> 00:31:22,715
Your highness.

672
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:25,217
Princess Noor, at last we meet.

673
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:26,594
That must be him.

674
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:29,889
Diaz, can you confirm? Diaz?

675
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:31,932
His signal is offline.

676
00:31:31,974 --> 00:31:33,851
His last location was the
auxiliary room to your right.

677
00:31:33,893 --> 00:31:37,396
I've got it. Stay in position.

678
00:31:37,438 --> 00:31:39,523
Forgive me. Virgil couldn't make it.

679
00:31:39,565 --> 00:31:41,942
I wasn't expecting other company.

680
00:31:41,984 --> 00:31:45,237
Not company.
More like proof of concept.

681
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:47,781
Mr. Bell works for A.R.G.U.S.,

682
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:50,993
one of the many we've
installed at the agency

683
00:31:51,035 --> 00:31:52,578
that now work for you.

684
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:02,713
My god.

685
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:04,882
Diaz must have used a
defibrillator to short the chip out.

686
00:32:04,924 --> 00:32:06,509
That's why we lost his signal!

687
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,636
Dante.

688
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:13,265
Excuse me.

689
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,978
Mr. Diaz.

690
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,605
No.

691
00:32:19,647 --> 00:32:21,273
You owe me a debt.

692
00:32:21,315 --> 00:32:23,859
This is the payment.

693
00:32:23,901 --> 00:32:25,402
It's a setup.

694
00:32:36,747 --> 00:32:38,332
Please.

695
00:32:38,374 --> 00:32:40,000
Unh!

696
00:32:40,042 --> 00:32:41,669
Forgive me, Princess.

697
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,180
- You ok?
- Yeah.

698
00:32:53,222 --> 00:32:55,266
Dante's headed for the
south exit. Everybody move in.

699
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:56,684
What about Diaz?

700
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:57,977
Dante's the objective. Go!

701
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:06,569
Leaving so soon?

702
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:07,820
Nah.

703
00:33:09,947 --> 00:33:11,198
Don't miss.

704
00:33:31,635 --> 00:33:33,512
Hey!

705
00:33:33,554 --> 00:33:35,180
You don't get to go free.

706
00:33:35,222 --> 00:33:39,268
Honey, didn't we go through this already?

707
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:41,854
You don't have what it takes.

708
00:33:43,147 --> 00:33:45,357
I do,

709
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:47,568
and I'm not scared of you,

710
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:51,280
and I am stronger than you are,

711
00:33:51,322 --> 00:33:53,866
which is why

712
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:55,159
I'm not going to kill you.

713
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:00,956
I thought Dante was the objective.

714
00:34:00,998 --> 00:34:04,627
He is the objective, just not the priority.

715
00:34:04,668 --> 00:34:06,420
Not this time.

716
00:34:15,346 --> 00:34:16,597
You made a big mistake.

717
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,349
Stand down!

718
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:19,725
This is over.

719
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:24,772
For now.

720
00:34:31,612 --> 00:34:33,280
He's gone.

721
00:34:39,331 --> 00:34:41,458
Well, Diaz will be
taken back to Slabside

722
00:34:41,499 --> 00:34:44,252
for reneging on his side of the deal.

723
00:34:44,294 --> 00:34:46,463
This time, he'll stay here.

724
00:34:46,504 --> 00:34:48,631
Still need to think about Dante.

725
00:34:48,673 --> 00:34:49,243
He's not gonna forget
what happened tonight.

726
00:34:49,243 --> 00:34:50,175
He's not gonna forget
what happened tonight.

727
00:34:50,216 --> 00:34:51,926
I won't either.

728
00:34:51,968 --> 00:34:53,678
You could have gone after
Dante, but you chose Diaz.

729
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,472
Last year, I had the
opportunity to catch Diaz,

730
00:34:55,513 --> 00:34:57,140
and I let it slip through my fingers.

731
00:34:57,182 --> 00:34:58,808
I wasn't gonna make the same mistake twice.

732
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:00,685
Well, what about Dante
being the greater threat?

733
00:35:00,727 --> 00:35:02,562
When I knew there was
a choice between catching

734
00:35:02,604 --> 00:35:04,689
Diaz or Dante, all I
could think about was

735
00:35:04,731 --> 00:35:07,108
what letting Diaz go meant
to you last time, Felicity,

736
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:10,236
so in that moment, I decided that

737
00:35:10,278 --> 00:35:13,490
sometimes the best choice
is to just protect your family,

738
00:35:13,531 --> 00:35:15,325
and that's exactly what you two are.

739
00:35:18,745 --> 00:35:21,748
I just got off the phone with the Pentagon.

740
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:24,876
We'll give you some privacy.

741
00:35:24,918 --> 00:35:26,127
Ok.

742
00:35:27,962 --> 00:35:31,466
Agent Bell will be getting
a hero's funeral.

743
00:35:31,508 --> 00:35:33,134
The official story is he was at the embassy

744
00:35:33,176 --> 00:35:35,053
on a covert assignment that went awry.

745
00:35:35,095 --> 00:35:37,305
Right. So it's a cover-up.

746
00:35:37,347 --> 00:35:39,140
Ok. What about the ghost initiative?

747
00:35:39,182 --> 00:35:40,350
- It's being suspended.
- Well, that's some good news.

748
00:35:40,392 --> 00:35:42,060
That's all the good news.

749
00:35:42,102 --> 00:35:44,187
We lost Dante, and I lost
my last chance to get him.

750
00:35:44,229 --> 00:35:46,022
You didn't lose your last chance.

751
00:35:47,565 --> 00:35:49,442
I'll be the one to resign.

752
00:35:49,484 --> 00:35:51,653
Look. We will tell them that I took out

753
00:35:51,694 --> 00:35:53,613
the ghost initiative without your consent

754
00:35:53,655 --> 00:35:55,281
and without your knowledge.

755
00:35:55,323 --> 00:35:57,200
No. This is my responsibility.

756
00:35:57,242 --> 00:35:59,244
Lyla, listen to me.

757
00:35:59,285 --> 00:36:02,497
We have no idea how
far this conspiracy goes.

758
00:36:02,539 --> 00:36:04,040
If you step down as director,

759
00:36:04,082 --> 00:36:07,544
we may never find out the truth.

760
00:36:07,585 --> 00:36:10,171
Being terminated for an opsec violation

761
00:36:10,213 --> 00:36:12,424
will ruin your career.

762
00:36:12,465 --> 00:36:14,801
But you'll still have yours.

763
00:36:14,843 --> 00:36:17,470
Let me take this fall

764
00:36:17,512 --> 00:36:19,472
for the family.

765
00:36:23,309 --> 00:36:24,894
Hey.

766
00:36:24,936 --> 00:36:27,188
Glad you called.

767
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:28,815
Thought you were done with me.

768
00:36:28,857 --> 00:36:32,485
Yeah, I did, too, until I got that.

769
00:36:32,527 --> 00:36:34,112
Yeah.

770
00:36:34,154 --> 00:36:37,240
Thanks for having Rene bring that over.

771
00:36:37,282 --> 00:36:39,367
I'm sure it's not SCPD protocol

772
00:36:39,409 --> 00:36:41,244
to release interrogation records.

773
00:36:41,286 --> 00:36:43,163
- Uh-uh.
- Yeah.

774
00:36:43,204 --> 00:36:45,248
Least I could do, though.

775
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:47,375
It is your mission.

776
00:36:49,002 --> 00:36:53,590
It's... been hard for me

777
00:36:53,631 --> 00:36:55,675
not seeing you as him.

778
00:36:55,717 --> 00:36:57,218
Him being our father?

779
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:59,846
I just assumed I shouldn't trust you.

780
00:36:59,888 --> 00:37:02,682
That's why I've been keeping
so much distance between us.

781
00:37:02,724 --> 00:37:04,225
Then you give me a chance,

782
00:37:04,267 --> 00:37:06,644
and I, of course, immediately overstep.

783
00:37:06,686 --> 00:37:08,229
Pretty much.

784
00:37:13,651 --> 00:37:17,238
I've lost a lot in my life.

785
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,824
People, you know, but...

786
00:37:19,866 --> 00:37:25,079
With you, I lost time,

787
00:37:25,121 --> 00:37:27,040
so you gave me a chance,
and I immediately saw it

788
00:37:27,081 --> 00:37:29,959
as an opportunity to get some of it back,

789
00:37:30,001 --> 00:37:31,836
but there was no excuse for the way

790
00:37:31,878 --> 00:37:34,797
that I behaved when I was
coming aboard your mission.

791
00:37:37,967 --> 00:37:40,637
I'm sorry.

792
00:37:40,678 --> 00:37:43,431
I didn't realize Oliver
Queen did apologies.

793
00:37:43,473 --> 00:37:47,060
Well, I mean, I didn't, but I've...

794
00:37:47,101 --> 00:37:49,145
Grown a bit over the years.

795
00:37:52,857 --> 00:37:55,026
So? Fill me in.

796
00:37:55,068 --> 00:37:56,569
What do you guys have so far?

797
00:37:56,611 --> 00:37:58,404
The same bomb plans you have,

798
00:37:58,446 --> 00:38:01,783
plus a map of tunnels into the glades.

799
00:38:01,824 --> 00:38:03,660
Cube in a cube.

800
00:38:03,701 --> 00:38:05,411
- You know it?
- Felicity used to

801
00:38:05,453 --> 00:38:07,330
force this stuff on me.

802
00:38:07,372 --> 00:38:09,415
Little, uh, mother-daughter bonding time

803
00:38:09,457 --> 00:38:11,042
before I wised up.

804
00:38:11,084 --> 00:38:12,835
There's another solve.

805
00:38:14,712 --> 00:38:20,426
Cube in a... Cube...

806
00:38:20,468 --> 00:38:22,428
In a cube.

807
00:38:29,894 --> 00:38:32,689
No way. Huh.

808
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:34,274
What is that?

809
00:38:34,315 --> 00:38:37,151
I think it's a mini-cassette.

810
00:38:37,193 --> 00:38:40,488
My grandparents had an answering
machine that used these.

811
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:42,240
What's an answering machine?

812
00:38:42,282 --> 00:38:44,117
It's not important.

813
00:38:44,158 --> 00:38:46,828
What is important is the
message that's on this tape.

814
00:38:46,869 --> 00:38:48,454
Can you hack it or...

815
00:38:48,496 --> 00:38:50,999
No. You can't hack this. Heh.

816
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,710
It's encryption through obsolescence.

817
00:38:53,751 --> 00:38:55,503
It's pretty genius, actually.

818
00:38:55,545 --> 00:38:57,297
Yeah, so genius, you can't listen to it.

819
00:38:57,338 --> 00:38:59,465
- We'll figure it out.
- I hope so...

820
00:38:59,507 --> 00:39:03,511
Because this could be the
key to finding our mom.

821
00:39:03,553 --> 00:39:06,806
Green Arrow
entering Queen residence.

822
00:39:06,848 --> 00:39:08,891
Hey! How'd it go?

823
00:39:08,933 --> 00:39:10,935
- Pretty good.
- Good.

824
00:39:10,977 --> 00:39:14,147
I feel like we're getting to a good place.

825
00:39:14,188 --> 00:39:16,774
- Mint chip.
- Hmm. You want some?

826
00:39:16,816 --> 00:39:18,651
I'm good.

827
00:39:18,693 --> 00:39:20,153
Just needed a little comfort food

828
00:39:20,194 --> 00:39:21,738
after the night we had.

829
00:39:21,779 --> 00:39:24,282
A night that could have
ended very differently.

830
00:39:24,324 --> 00:39:28,077
You want to know why I didn't kill Diaz.

831
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:29,746
I wanted to.

832
00:39:32,123 --> 00:39:34,375
I was ready to.

833
00:39:34,417 --> 00:39:39,380
Then I realized killing Diaz

834
00:39:39,422 --> 00:39:41,549
wasn't going to prove anything.

835
00:39:41,591 --> 00:39:43,801
The whole reason I wanted Diaz dead

836
00:39:43,843 --> 00:39:46,012
was to protect our family,

837
00:39:46,054 --> 00:39:49,243
and... what our family needs

838
00:39:49,243 --> 00:39:51,434
and... what our family needs

839
00:39:51,476 --> 00:39:53,728
is a fresh start,

840
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:56,356
one in the light just like you're doing.

841
00:39:59,692 --> 00:40:02,362
I want our children to know

842
00:40:02,403 --> 00:40:05,907
that they are the most
important thing to us

843
00:40:05,948 --> 00:40:09,160
and that we would do anything...

844
00:40:09,202 --> 00:40:11,788
Anything for them.

845
00:40:11,829 --> 00:40:15,583
Ahem. You said, "children."

846
00:40:15,625 --> 00:40:17,251
I'm pregnant.

847
00:40:21,005 --> 00:40:22,298
Ha ha!

848
00:40:32,266 --> 00:40:34,185
Impressive.

849
00:40:34,227 --> 00:40:36,187
You shouldn't be here.

850
00:40:39,482 --> 00:40:42,985
Is that any way to greet an old friend?

851
00:40:43,027 --> 00:40:46,280
I hear you and Oliver queen are
getting along quite well.

852
00:40:48,991 --> 00:40:51,411
- He trusts me now.
- Good.

853
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:56,290
The timing couldn't be better.

854
00:40:56,332 --> 00:40:58,626
It's time for you to come home.

855
00:41:14,308 --> 00:41:16,102
What are you doing here?

856
00:41:21,941 --> 00:41:23,526
Unh!

857
00:42:08,529 --> 00:42:09,864
Greg, move your head!
