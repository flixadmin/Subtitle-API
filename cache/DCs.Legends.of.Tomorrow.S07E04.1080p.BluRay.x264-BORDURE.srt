1
00:00:15,016 --> 00:00:16,851
All right, we gotta ditch Hoover's car.

2
00:00:16,935 --> 00:00:18,855
APB's probably already out
on the Bullet Blondes.

3
00:00:18,937 --> 00:00:21,898
That's fine. From here,
we'll just hop a train to New York.

4
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:24,442
Oh! Another train? Must we?

5
00:00:24,526 --> 00:00:26,587
By my math, we should have
enough left for three tickets.

6
00:00:26,611 --> 00:00:29,030
The other half can hang out
in John's portable phantom house.

7
00:00:29,155 --> 00:00:31,366
I mean, it's technically
my portable phantom house.

8
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:33,535
But more importantly, does your math

9
00:00:33,618 --> 00:00:36,412
account for Gary's
overly-generous tipping?

10
00:00:36,496 --> 00:00:38,540
- He gave our last waitress 20 bucks.
- No.

11
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,584
$20? That's over a quarter
of our entire budget, Gary.

12
00:00:41,668 --> 00:00:43,878
$20 for a six-top seems fair to me.

13
00:00:43,962 --> 00:00:46,522
Okay, so what's the damage?
Do we have enough to get to New York?

14
00:00:46,923 --> 00:00:49,384
$35. That's enough for
one ticket and a few meals,

15
00:00:49,467 --> 00:00:52,095
tipping like a normal person, in 1925.

16
00:00:53,137 --> 00:00:55,848
All right, I call phantom house
'cause I am over trains.

17
00:00:55,932 --> 00:00:57,159
But we still have to get across town

18
00:00:57,183 --> 00:00:59,435
and on that train
without anyone recognizing us.

19
00:01:01,062 --> 00:01:04,065
Well, then we stopped
at the right place.

20
00:01:09,821 --> 00:01:11,739
Oh...

21
00:01:12,407 --> 00:01:14,367
I think yes.

22
00:01:15,618 --> 00:01:18,037
Yes, it's very cute,
but we need to hide the blonde, babe.

23
00:01:18,121 --> 00:01:19,455
- What about this?
- Yes.

24
00:01:20,915 --> 00:01:22,041
Yes. It works.

25
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:26,379
No, no, no. We are in the 1920s.
That is not the look.

26
00:01:26,462 --> 00:01:30,550
Okay, sir, can we see
all your wigs that are bobs?

27
00:01:34,429 --> 00:01:36,264
Um... Hello? Potential customer here.

28
00:01:36,347 --> 00:01:38,075
I asked you a question
which any good salesman

29
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:41,102
would take as an opportunity
to up-sell your finest wigs.

30
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:46,190
- Is he...
- Um... Hello?

31
00:01:47,317 --> 00:01:48,735
Yeah. She asked you a question.

32
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:52,238
I'm sorry, miss.
I didn't realize she was with you.

33
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:54,657
These are the only bobs on display

34
00:01:54,741 --> 00:01:57,201
since most of you ladies
chop and style your own.

35
00:01:57,577 --> 00:01:58,703
Well, that's not happening.

36
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:01,164
Well, of course.
Not with those gorgeous locks.

37
00:02:02,206 --> 00:02:03,791
Let me see what I can find in the back.

38
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:08,046
Racist dick.

39
00:02:09,756 --> 00:02:13,301
I'm sorry. Let's just get these
disguises and get out of here, yeah?

40
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:14,927
Yeah. It's okay. Sorry.

41
00:02:20,475 --> 00:02:22,810
Uh... Is it just me or...

42
00:02:22,894 --> 00:02:25,574
We probably should've ditched
Hoover's car before entering the city.

43
00:02:25,605 --> 00:02:26,981
Yeah. Come on.

44
00:02:27,732 --> 00:02:29,692
Hey, hey. Police found Hoover's car.

45
00:02:29,776 --> 00:02:31,128
They're onto us.
We gotta get outta here.

46
00:02:31,152 --> 00:02:33,821
I've got bobs in three different shades.

47
00:02:33,905 --> 00:02:36,157
- Brunette, redhead...
- We'll take them both.

48
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:38,826
- Well, there's also blondes...
- No blondes.

49
00:02:39,452 --> 00:02:41,292
Okay,
how much for the two wigs?

50
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:43,831
Wait a minute.

51
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:46,542
- Are you two...
- Nope.

52
00:02:46,626 --> 00:02:50,129
They're definitely not the...
Whatever you were gonna say.

53
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:57,595
- Guys, we gotta hustle.
- Okay. Here's what's gonna happen.

54
00:02:57,679 --> 00:02:59,972
You're gonna help us
sneak out of here unnoticed

55
00:03:00,056 --> 00:03:02,475
and we will buy these wigs
at double wholesale.

56
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:06,896
- Triple.
- That is robbery.

57
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:10,024
Look who's talking. Bullet Blondes.

58
00:03:12,652 --> 00:03:14,404
They're crossing the street.

59
00:03:20,076 --> 00:03:21,494
- You've gotta be...
- Aves.

60
00:03:21,619 --> 00:03:22,619
Are you serious?

61
00:03:22,662 --> 00:03:24,502
Give him the money.

62
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:34,749
Wig, wig, wig.

63
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:35,925
Yeah, here you go.

64
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:37,009
- Put it on.
- Thank you.

65
00:03:37,093 --> 00:03:38,553
Good. Good.

66
00:03:41,514 --> 00:03:43,307
They're not very far.

67
00:03:44,183 --> 00:03:45,768
Over here. Check the alleyways.

68
00:03:48,187 --> 00:03:49,856
This is literally our only option.

69
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:53,276
Great. Then put the key in. We can
hang out here until the coast is clear.

70
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:00,074
- Hey.
- Hey.

71
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:05,455
You looking for the Sapphire String?

72
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,458
- Maybe.
- You got the password?

73
00:04:09,584 --> 00:04:10,835
- Uh...
- Uh...

74
00:04:12,962 --> 00:04:13,963
Swordfish.

75
00:04:15,715 --> 00:04:17,884
- He meant salmon.
- Mackerel.

76
00:04:18,176 --> 00:04:19,385
Are we doing this?

77
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,262
Are we really fishing
for a stupid password

78
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:23,014
so we can get out of this garbage alley?

79
00:04:23,222 --> 00:04:26,684
Gang, we're screwed.
We have no money, no allies.

80
00:04:26,768 --> 00:04:31,022
This time period sucks for anyone
who's not white, male and rich.

81
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:34,025
And only one of us, it's you,
is at least two of those things.

82
00:04:34,776 --> 00:04:36,986
You said the password. Come on in.

83
00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:40,990
- Wait. What was it?
- Password.

84
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:43,701
Ah! I see what he did there.

85
00:04:45,495 --> 00:04:47,135
The password is "password"?

86
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,335
Welcome to my club. Name's Eddie.

87
00:04:53,294 --> 00:04:56,589
Sorry it's a little quiet right now.
Running a little low on the drinks.

88
00:04:58,341 --> 00:05:02,470
We're at a speakeasy.
A very inclusive one, considering.

89
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,805
Considering what?

90
00:05:03,888 --> 00:05:07,350
Well, the Mob had a tight grip on these
establishments and kept them segregated.

91
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:10,978
It looks like we've stumbled into one
that caters to everyone, which is rare.

92
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:14,732
I guess that's why
the password is "password."

93
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:17,235
- You play, brother?
- I noodle.

94
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:19,111
Come make us some pasta.

95
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:27,370
- What we got here? E flat?
- Yeah, brother.

96
00:05:27,453 --> 00:05:28,955
- Classic.
- Yeah.

97
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:53,604
This is so degrading.

98
00:05:53,688 --> 00:05:54,981
This is so exciting.

99
00:05:55,064 --> 00:05:57,525
All right, we got through step one.
Sneak onto the train.

100
00:05:57,608 --> 00:06:02,238
- Step two is the ride to Chicago.
- Steps? Who died and made you Ava?

101
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:05,032
We're going to New York
to prevent that from happening.

102
00:06:05,116 --> 00:06:07,785
That reminds me. Don't talk
to anyone any more than we have to.

103
00:06:07,994 --> 00:06:10,997
- We can't mess up the timeline.
- Okay, Captain Sharpe.

104
00:06:11,873 --> 00:06:12,915
That's Spooner Cruz.

105
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:14,852
The most important thing
is to avoid any suspicion

106
00:06:14,876 --> 00:06:16,210
for sneaking onto the train.

107
00:06:16,294 --> 00:06:19,005
- Tickets, please.
- Crap. Let's go.

108
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:22,049
Tickets? Hey. Hey.
I need to see your tickets.

109
00:06:26,387 --> 00:06:28,222
Trying to sneak on my train
without a ticket?

110
00:06:28,306 --> 00:06:29,765
What? No.

111
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:34,979
I just had it in my hands.
Maybe I dropped it while we were moving.

112
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:36,182
You're off at the next stop.

113
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:39,400
Stella, why are you bothering
this nice ticket man?

114
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:42,904
I apologize if these three
have given you any trouble.

115
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,448
These ladies are with you?

116
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:48,451
You're looking at the best pianist,

117
00:06:48,534 --> 00:06:51,454
bassist, and clarinetist
you'll ever hear.

118
00:06:51,871 --> 00:06:54,707
Just ask my boyfriend, Mr. Bottoni.

119
00:06:56,334 --> 00:07:00,004
Of course, our train tickets
are all in our manager's pocket.

120
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:03,341
You're welcome to wake him
from his beauty rest.

121
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:05,801
But I have to warn you,
he has quite the temper.

122
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:08,846
You all enjoy your trip.

123
00:07:14,685 --> 00:07:17,104
I'm Maude and we're the Masqueradies.

124
00:07:18,564 --> 00:07:19,982
Welcome to the band.

125
00:07:41,754 --> 00:07:43,923
Any mention of an exploded Hoover?

126
00:07:44,757 --> 00:07:46,550
According to this,
he's still alive and well

127
00:07:46,634 --> 00:07:48,761
and ready to take on
the most notorious criminals,

128
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:51,055
Capone and the Bullet Blondes.

129
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:54,433
It's only a matter of time, babe.
He's after us.

130
00:07:55,518 --> 00:07:58,270
So there's a new
and improved Hoover-Bot. Great.

131
00:07:58,771 --> 00:08:02,858
- What else does the paper say?
- Oh! That we're bootleggers and robbers.

132
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:06,737
Worst of all, we're sisters.

133
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:08,906
- Sisters?
- Yeah.

134
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:11,367
We can't go on like this.

135
00:08:11,993 --> 00:08:14,662
We can't rob another bank
because it'll cause too much attention.

136
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:16,998
- And we have no money.
- I know.

137
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:20,714
What are we gonna do?

138
00:08:23,921 --> 00:08:27,967
Well, maybe it's time to give
our other enterprise a shot.

139
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:39,478
Wow!

140
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:42,148
- You make this yourself?
- Plenty more where that came from.

141
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:46,569
All we ask is access to your storage
room for the night and 25% of the bar.

142
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:50,448
- What do you want with my storage room?
- 20%. No questions.

143
00:08:52,825 --> 00:08:57,121
- We got a deal.
- All right. Let's move some booze.

144
00:09:06,464 --> 00:09:08,174
The car was impounded an hour ago.

145
00:09:09,884 --> 00:09:11,469
Your ears to the ground, boys.

146
00:09:13,054 --> 00:09:17,016
Bullet Blondes are in Chicago
and are bound to make their move soon.

147
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:25,524
You really got us
out of a sticky situation back there.

148
00:09:25,608 --> 00:09:27,902
It was plain as day
that you needed a hand.

149
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:29,320
Believe me, I've been there.

150
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:32,615
Gals help gals and make new pals.
That's how I see it.

151
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:35,785
If we don't look out
for one another, who will? Men?

152
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:39,205
Men don't look out.
They look at, if you know what I mean.

153
00:09:40,498 --> 00:09:42,934
You're referring to the rampant
commodification of females by males

154
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:45,002
that is the societal norm
of this decade.

155
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:49,799
You talk funny.

156
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:54,637
I like it. My name's Suzie Spencer.

157
00:09:56,138 --> 00:09:57,556
Suzanne Spencer.

158
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:02,061
Marries Colin Baker in 1928, has four
children, retires in Florida and dies...

159
00:10:02,144 --> 00:10:03,813
That's enough talking, Gideon.

160
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:06,315
You're supposed to be resting
your voice, remember?

161
00:10:06,816 --> 00:10:07,817
Oh.

162
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:10,861
Time to play the quiet game.

163
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:15,282
Oh, the game invented by parents to
quell their irritating children. Got it.

164
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:19,537
So, you're a jazz band
called the Masqueradies?

165
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:23,999
I know it's a silly moniker. We wear
fancy masks as part of our schtick.

166
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,545
Not that it made a lick of difference
on our East Coast tour.

167
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:28,671
We barely broke even.

168
00:10:28,963 --> 00:10:31,006
You know how it is,
being musicians yourselves.

169
00:10:34,802 --> 00:10:36,053
She's resting her voice?

170
00:10:36,971 --> 00:10:41,892
Right. Yeah.
Gideon here is the lark of London.

171
00:10:43,227 --> 00:10:47,439
Spoon... Esperanza is her vocal coach

172
00:10:48,232 --> 00:10:50,818
and I am her manager.

173
00:10:52,111 --> 00:10:56,615
A manager? Oh, my. They do things
differently in London, don't they?

174
00:10:57,199 --> 00:11:00,828
Between us gals, I would kill
to have a woman managing our business.

175
00:11:01,162 --> 00:11:02,163
Mmm-hmm.

176
00:11:02,246 --> 00:11:06,542
Donny over there is
just an overpaid bodyguard really.

177
00:11:06,876 --> 00:11:08,127
Is that so?

178
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:13,257
- Can I take a look at your contract?
- Sure. I have it right here.

179
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:27,396
Strange looking compact.

180
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:32,776
Oh, yeah. It's from California,
by way of China.

181
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:36,989
You know, business is
really picking up in here.

182
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:39,512
Yeah. It's 'cause the word got out
that we got the good stuff.

183
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:42,411
What can I get for you?
Whiskey on the rocks or straight up?

184
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:43,954
Oh. Neither. I don't drink.

185
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,041
- For health or faith?
- Faith.

186
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:49,126
Okay.

187
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,255
Soda water with lemon. On the house.

188
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:54,965
Thank you.

189
00:12:05,476 --> 00:12:08,276
Helps to know "cheers" in different
languages. I get all kinds in here.

190
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:09,813
Yeah.

191
00:12:11,482 --> 00:12:13,442
- That your brother?
- Yeah, it is.

192
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:17,196
I've actually never heard him
play like that before.

193
00:12:18,072 --> 00:12:19,156
And you never will again.

194
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:23,077
Because what's going on
up there is a one-time special.

195
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,161
Oh, right.

196
00:12:24,245 --> 00:12:26,413
Yeah. Those three guys
are feeling the vibe,

197
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:29,083
riffing off what the other guys
are bringing to the moment.

198
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,251
You can't recreate that.

199
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:34,922
Yeah, well, where I'm from, we have
a saying. Pics or it didn't happen.

200
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:38,842
A picture couldn't describe
the here and now. Here.

201
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:41,971
Now. It forces you to pay attention

202
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,099
or to just let it roll on
over you like a wave.

203
00:12:53,357 --> 00:12:56,735
This is a catastrophe.
When did you sign this?

204
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:59,571
About three years ago,
when we first formed the band.

205
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:04,660
Okay, good. Hey, blubberbutt. Wake up.

206
00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:06,287
You don't want to do this.

207
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:09,915
It says here that you're taking 60%,
criminal, mind you,

208
00:13:09,999 --> 00:13:11,625
and yet you still don't have
these ladies

209
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:13,335
riding in first-class accommodation?

210
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:15,671
Are you lazy or stupid or both?

211
00:13:17,548 --> 00:13:19,466
You're telling me how to do my job?

212
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:22,720
What's a colored girl like you
know anything about contracts?

213
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:26,932
Where I'm from, managers
and producers are a dime a dozen.

214
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:29,059
I learned from Phil Spector himself.

215
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:33,564
There's a clause here that says
these terms expire after 24 months.

216
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:35,482
This paperwork is defunct.

217
00:13:36,317 --> 00:13:38,777
So I suggest that you
draw up a new contract

218
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:41,780
that will actually benefit your clients,
not exploit them.

219
00:13:42,406 --> 00:13:44,908
You can't make me do anything.

220
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:47,494
True. I can't.

221
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:48,996
But she can.

222
00:13:56,503 --> 00:14:00,049
- You're fired.
- What do you mean, fired?

223
00:14:00,132 --> 00:14:02,593
You're out of a job, you low life.

224
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:05,137
So we'll be taking these.

225
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:15,356
Would you look at that?
These for the first-class cabin.

226
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:19,068
Grab your gear, girls.
You just got upgraded.

227
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:57,523
Where's my wife? I want to brag
to her about how I solved

228
00:14:57,606 --> 00:15:00,609
all of our problems with some
good old-fashioned bootlegging.

229
00:15:00,943 --> 00:15:03,529
She is taking a siesta in her mansion.

230
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:05,739
She said her wig was too itchy.
Probably synthetic.

231
00:15:05,823 --> 00:15:07,658
I kind of wish we could stay longer.

232
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:11,578
Well, no can do, B.
Train for New York leaves at 8:00 a.m.

233
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:16,166
We gotta find this Gwyn Davies guy so he
can invent us some time travel and boom.

234
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,251
Here's the rest.

235
00:15:17,793 --> 00:15:19,128
We got all we need. You keep it.

236
00:15:19,837 --> 00:15:22,881
Thanks. Are you sure
you all can fit back there?

237
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,800
No questions.

238
00:15:26,969 --> 00:15:30,597
Well, tonight was, um, eye opening.

239
00:15:31,432 --> 00:15:33,100
You all are welcome back anytime.

240
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:36,478
And I know you mean that.
Good luck, Eddie.

241
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:55,080
Eddie.

242
00:15:55,998 --> 00:16:00,169
- Been a while.
- Evening, Mr. Bottoni.

243
00:16:02,004 --> 00:16:04,131
When I rented you this place,

244
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:07,009
it was just a bunch of curtains
and a gramophone.

245
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:08,635
Now look at it.

246
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:12,431
Looks good. Almost classy.

247
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:14,683
Thank you.

248
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:17,728
Things sure do change.

249
00:16:18,562 --> 00:16:24,526
For example, I told you you could
rent my little space for cheap

250
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,446
and I'd supply you with your liquor.

251
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:32,201
And what do I hear
but you got another source?

252
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:53,847
Eddie? Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

253
00:16:54,223 --> 00:16:56,517
Help. Help. We need help in here.

254
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,186
- Zari?
- He's hurt.

255
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:05,359
You're the Bullet Blondes?

256
00:17:06,527 --> 00:17:07,569
Oh, no.

257
00:17:07,945 --> 00:17:10,489
- Eddie, what happened to you?
- Yeah. Who did this to you?

258
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:12,991
You did.

259
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,674
- We can explain.
- I think I understand just fine.

260
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:31,760
You conned me. You put me
in the middle of a damn Mob war.

261
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:34,012
Now because of you,
I don't own this bar anymore.

262
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:37,057
- How's that work?
- My landlord, he's a mobster.

263
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:39,619
He found out I worked with you
and took the whole thing back.

264
00:17:39,643 --> 00:17:42,896
Everything I had was in this bar and now
it's gone, 'cause of one night with you.

265
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,648
- Eddie...
- Just go.

266
00:17:44,982 --> 00:17:47,442
The Mob will be here soon,
so you better not be.

267
00:17:52,281 --> 00:17:53,883
You're just gonna
let him leave like that?

268
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:55,117
What are we supposed to do?

269
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,952
We can't take down
the entire Chicago Mob.

270
00:17:57,202 --> 00:17:58,388
Our train leaves in a few hours.

271
00:17:58,412 --> 00:18:01,582
A train we'd have no way
of affording if it weren't for his help.

272
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:04,334
He's the only one
who's opened his doors to us.

273
00:18:04,418 --> 00:18:08,088
In fact, he's the only open-minded
person we've met on this entire trip.

274
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:10,716
- We have to fix this.
- Yeah, but how?

275
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:14,511
Money. Money. Money can fix anything.

276
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:17,347
If you hand me the reins for 24 hours,

277
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:21,518
I will help Eddie make enough money
to get back on his feet and then some.

278
00:18:22,185 --> 00:18:24,938
It's just... We said small footprints
to the timeline.

279
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:28,442
Aves, we can't keep leaving
the timeline worse than we found it.

280
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,069
This place is one of the few safe spaces

281
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:33,905
that exists in this entire
crummy time period.

282
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:37,951
I'm not gonna be able to sleep knowing
we had a hand in destroying it. Are you?

283
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:42,831
- Let's do it.
- Thank you.

284
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:48,670
Zari's really wearing the pants
on this mission. I think I like it.

285
00:18:55,886 --> 00:18:58,555
What could you possibly show me
that's gonna change anything?

286
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:00,974
Just patience, please.

287
00:19:02,351 --> 00:19:06,021
You know, it's locked. Can you
help me find a key? Maybe over there.

288
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:09,107
- A key? Just around?
- Mmm-hmm.

289
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:10,859
Mmm-hmm.

290
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:16,406
You know what? I found it.

291
00:19:25,499 --> 00:19:27,334
What is it with you people
and storage rooms?

292
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:32,631
It's a fair observation,
but just give it a chance, okay?

293
00:19:42,391 --> 00:19:46,061
Okay, picture the main dance floor here.

294
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:48,897
A more exclusive lounge over here.

295
00:19:49,064 --> 00:19:51,525
No smoking, of course,
but darker, sexier.

296
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:56,071
- And a bar over there.
- Whoa! Give me a second here.

297
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,784
Eddie, can I be real with you?

298
00:20:01,118 --> 00:20:03,912
I know a thing or two
about throwing an excellent soirée,

299
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:07,666
and I'm going to throw you
the biggest fundraiser of the season.

300
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,627
Buddy, you are going to get
a Zari party.

301
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:18,927
All aboard.

302
00:20:20,262 --> 00:20:23,223
- Ms. Beaumont? Telegram for you.
- Thank you.

303
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:34,192
Hurry up, ladies.

304
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:37,487
My honey's got a new club and he wants
us to perform tonight. Ain't it great?

305
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:43,368
- You okay, hon?
- Yeah. Just feeling a bit queasy.

306
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:47,539
You know what'll help? A big plate
of eggs, bacon and hotcakes.

307
00:20:47,622 --> 00:20:49,708
There'll be breakfast
at the new club, I'm sure.

308
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,461
We should probably be
on our way to New York.

309
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:55,922
Well, shucks. The train to the Big Apple
leaves once a day at 8:00 a.m.

310
00:20:56,006 --> 00:20:58,884
- It's half past already.
- Damn it.

311
00:20:59,968 --> 00:21:01,678
Don't fret. You can just come with me.

312
00:21:01,762 --> 00:21:04,556
- No, we don't impose.
- That sounds perfect.

313
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:08,178
Well, there's nothing else to do other
than wait around at the station, right?

314
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:11,354
Well, aces. Follow me.

315
00:21:15,484 --> 00:21:17,903
My stomach telling me
something's off with these guys.

316
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:20,697
Your stomach is telling you
to get some free food.

317
00:21:26,286 --> 00:21:30,540
Okay, Zari, things are coming
right along. That is good.

318
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:35,378
I need better than good.
I need epic. I need a gimmick. A hook.

319
00:21:40,801 --> 00:21:42,177
I need a show.

320
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:45,680
B, Eddie.

321
00:21:46,223 --> 00:21:49,559
Okay? I need you guys to get out there
and spread the word.

322
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:52,604
I have the one thing
that's going to set this party off.

323
00:21:52,854 --> 00:21:54,689
For one night, and one night only,

324
00:21:54,773 --> 00:21:56,608
the Bullet Blondes are going to put on

325
00:21:56,691 --> 00:21:59,110
the greatest show
this town has ever seen.

326
00:22:00,362 --> 00:22:01,988
Wait. We're gonna do what?

327
00:22:07,244 --> 00:22:09,871
So you're saying we can get
the word out with just one guy?

328
00:22:09,955 --> 00:22:11,081
More than sure.

329
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:14,209
If you want a secret kept,
you make sure Ricky's the last to know.

330
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,380
Eddie, heard about the club.
You doing all right?

331
00:22:17,754 --> 00:22:20,465
Peaches, Ricky.
Say, can you keep a secret?

332
00:22:28,682 --> 00:22:30,934
The Bullet Blondes.
Really. The password is...

333
00:22:31,142 --> 00:22:32,435
- Rutabaga.
- Rutabaga.

334
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:33,788
- Rutabaga.
- Rutabaga.

335
00:22:33,812 --> 00:22:35,412
- Rutabaga.
- Rutabaga.

336
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:41,236
Ain't this Eddie's place?

337
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:44,990
Rehearsal in five, ladies.

338
00:22:46,116 --> 00:22:47,993
Now let's see about
getting you some breakfast.

339
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:50,537
Maude.

340
00:22:53,164 --> 00:22:55,458
Hi, baby cakes. We're home.

341
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:58,920
Nice new spot you got here.
Can't wait to get a wiggle on.

342
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:01,590
What's this I hear about
you firing Donny?

343
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,677
Donny was not a very good manager, baby.

344
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,761
See here.

345
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:10,682
Miss Astra here helped me draw up
new terms for a proper manager.

346
00:23:10,891 --> 00:23:12,142
Give me that.

347
00:23:14,436 --> 00:23:18,315
Garbage. This is what happens
when you do things without me.

348
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:21,192
I knew that whole tour was a bad idea.

349
00:23:21,484 --> 00:23:26,573
Your manager is whoever I say it is.
Understood?

350
00:23:28,158 --> 00:23:29,451
Yes, I understand.

351
00:23:31,995 --> 00:23:36,082
New band member? Put her up front.
Give the audience something to look at.

352
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:40,462
Tonight is a big night, baby.

353
00:23:41,379 --> 00:23:45,050
Mr. Williams from RCA will be here,

354
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:48,678
so get those getaway sticks to rehearsal

355
00:23:48,762 --> 00:23:52,432
so you can sing open his checkbook
and get us a record deal.

356
00:23:58,563 --> 00:23:59,856
Maude, wait.

357
00:24:01,858 --> 00:24:05,320
- Hey. What was that?
- What do you mean, hon?

358
00:24:05,904 --> 00:24:09,157
In front of your boyfriend?
You just disappeared.

359
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,410
I know he can be
a little rough sometimes,

360
00:24:12,494 --> 00:24:14,496
but he's just got his preferences.

361
00:24:14,871 --> 00:24:17,916
- You know how it is.
- No. Tell me.

362
00:24:20,085 --> 00:24:22,212
He found me when I was
nothing but a string bean

363
00:24:22,295 --> 00:24:23,964
with a undisciplined set of pipes.

364
00:24:24,589 --> 00:24:26,299
I'm thankful. I really am.

365
00:24:27,258 --> 00:24:30,679
You heard. Even RCA is coming
to see little old me.

366
00:24:31,513 --> 00:24:33,473
When he says, "Sing," I ask "What song?"

367
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:36,517
But what happens when
you don't feel like singing?

368
00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:39,312
You just don't get it.

369
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:48,488
Ross loves me. And I owe him everything.

370
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:53,410
Ross.

371
00:24:54,995 --> 00:24:56,329
Ross Bottoni.

372
00:25:02,502 --> 00:25:06,881
<i>Lately I've been wrung around</i>

373
00:25:07,632 --> 00:25:12,262
<i>Tossed and turned about</i>

374
00:25:13,972 --> 00:25:15,390
<i>Could this be the end?</i>

375
00:25:15,932 --> 00:25:19,561
Maude's boyfriend, I know him.
Ross Bottoni. I met him in Hell.

376
00:25:19,644 --> 00:25:21,688
He talked about my "getaway sticks"

377
00:25:21,771 --> 00:25:24,607
so I covered him in his worst fear,
1,000 tiny spiders.

378
00:25:25,025 --> 00:25:27,277
That man is a monster.
We have to help her.

379
00:25:28,236 --> 00:25:31,489
Astra, if we try to rescue every woman
in a bad relationship

380
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:34,534
from here to New York,
we'll never get a mile out of Chicago.

381
00:25:34,993 --> 00:25:37,662
Maude chose this.
This is her life. She said so.

382
00:25:37,787 --> 00:25:39,205
Nobody chooses this.

383
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:40,861
They find themselves in too deep

384
00:25:40,915 --> 00:25:43,793
and they have to grab on to whatever
they can to keep from drowning.

385
00:25:43,877 --> 00:25:46,880
That is not a choice.
That is survival, Spooner.

386
00:25:50,383 --> 00:25:54,929
- You know, maybe she'll be okay.
- Gideon, what happens to Maude?

387
00:25:56,389 --> 00:25:59,142
Is this a test?
I'm meant to be playing the quiet game.

388
00:25:59,267 --> 00:26:03,396
Forget the quiet game. Will she be okay?

389
00:26:07,692 --> 00:26:09,253
The body of Maude Beaumont will be found

390
00:26:09,277 --> 00:26:12,197
floating in the Chicago River
December 18th, 1925.

391
00:26:13,448 --> 00:26:17,368
Her death is ruled as a homicide,
but no charges are formally brought.

392
00:26:19,412 --> 00:26:22,582
<i>Are you pretending</i>

393
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:23,917
Astra...

394
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,040
I don't care
if this is how it's supposed to happen.

395
00:26:27,337 --> 00:26:30,340
I'm gonna save Maude and
there is nothing you can do to stop me.

396
00:26:40,642 --> 00:26:43,436
Gary, I need you to make sure
the silks are secure.

397
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,872
We can't have it falling down
during the big show.

398
00:26:44,896 --> 00:26:46,523
- Yeah?
- Absolutely, Zari.

399
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:49,567
And can I just say I think
you're doing a fantastic job

400
00:26:49,651 --> 00:26:50,777
leading us on this mission?

401
00:26:51,528 --> 00:26:52,529
I know.

402
00:26:55,323 --> 00:26:58,326
- It's pathological with you, isn't it?
- What are you talking about?

403
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:01,496
- You have a crush on Zari.
- What? No.

404
00:27:01,746 --> 00:27:03,933
Gary, you know what's happening here.
It's not a real crush.

405
00:27:03,957 --> 00:27:06,292
Zari's triggering your attraction
to powerful people.

406
00:27:06,376 --> 00:27:09,254
Think about it. Kayla, Ava, John...

407
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:11,131
She might hear you.

408
00:27:12,924 --> 00:27:15,552
You get off being bossed around,
you little sicko.

409
00:27:16,678 --> 00:27:18,054
You're just figuring this out now?

410
00:27:18,221 --> 00:27:22,350
Gary, don't you want to be with someone
who respects you for the alien you are?

411
00:27:22,767 --> 00:27:24,227
No, not really.

412
00:27:24,769 --> 00:27:26,688
Worried about you, Gare.

413
00:27:27,147 --> 00:27:30,525
I'm worried about you too, but I don't
go around shaming your pathology, do I?

414
00:27:30,775 --> 00:27:32,569
My pathology? What pathology?

415
00:27:32,861 --> 00:27:35,822
Well, that you find yourself in these
relationships that can't go anywhere,

416
00:27:35,905 --> 00:27:37,967
so you don't have to put yourself
in the vulnerable position

417
00:27:37,991 --> 00:27:39,671
of really giving yourself
to another person

418
00:27:39,701 --> 00:27:42,381
because you have the excuse of timelines
or Totems holding you back.

419
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,040
What?

420
00:27:46,124 --> 00:27:49,669
Okay, gang. The Blondes
have been rehearsing like crazy.

421
00:27:49,752 --> 00:27:53,840
The mood is set and the whiskey
is literally all you can drink.

422
00:27:54,257 --> 00:27:56,217
Are we ready to party?

423
00:27:56,301 --> 00:27:58,861
I'm ready to party all night long,
because I'm in a relationship.

424
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,222
You do need to define
what that means, though.

425
00:28:01,639 --> 00:28:03,039
Define whatever you need to define,

426
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:05,099
but I need you to do it as doormen
with good vibes.

427
00:28:05,852 --> 00:28:08,104
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

428
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:10,523
Hey, remember. Good vibes.

429
00:28:10,857 --> 00:28:14,235
- No. Great vibes.
- Yeah. Great vibes.

430
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:18,781
I can fix that. I think.

431
00:28:18,865 --> 00:28:21,409
Hey, Zari,
do we have to do this in heels?

432
00:28:21,492 --> 00:28:22,577
Yes.

433
00:28:24,579 --> 00:28:26,164
Is everything good?

434
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:29,667
Eddie, everything is perfect.

435
00:28:31,044 --> 00:28:32,170
It's a Zari party.

436
00:28:38,927 --> 00:28:43,056
Hi. Ross Bottoni.
You're here to hear my gal, Maude.

437
00:28:43,139 --> 00:28:45,558
She's got the best pipes
in the business.

438
00:28:45,642 --> 00:28:48,978
Come this way.
We got a table for you in the front.

439
00:28:53,358 --> 00:28:57,153
- Maude, you have to leave.
- Leave it be, will you?

440
00:28:57,779 --> 00:29:01,074
I can't believe I'm the first broad
you ever met with a grumpy guy.

441
00:29:02,367 --> 00:29:04,244
Besides, I'm not gonna hit the road

442
00:29:04,327 --> 00:29:06,162
right before the greatest show
of my life.

443
00:29:06,246 --> 00:29:07,705
If you stay, he will kill you.

444
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:12,877
Save the drama for the stage, honey.
It ain't gonna work on me.

445
00:29:14,462 --> 00:29:15,672
Look, you know it's true.

446
00:29:17,548 --> 00:29:19,884
You feel it in your gut
every time you think of him.

447
00:29:20,134 --> 00:29:23,012
It twists your insides
every time he speaks.

448
00:29:23,888 --> 00:29:25,848
You want to vomit
every time he touches you.

449
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:29,269
You're terrified, and you should be.

450
00:29:37,527 --> 00:29:40,947
There's a better life for you
out there, Maude. Trust me. I know.

451
00:29:49,747 --> 00:29:50,957
This is crazy.

452
00:29:53,251 --> 00:29:54,752
What about the performance?

453
00:29:54,836 --> 00:29:58,214
He's gonna know the second
the curtain rises that something's up.

454
00:29:58,756 --> 00:30:01,718
And the girls,
he's gonna take it out on them.

455
00:30:02,385 --> 00:30:04,637
Maude, we'll take care of Ross.

456
00:30:04,721 --> 00:30:06,597
Just go. Please, before it's too late.

457
00:30:17,108 --> 00:30:18,568
Oh! Thank you.

458
00:30:21,612 --> 00:30:24,615
You know, I always said gals
help gals and make new pals.

459
00:30:25,283 --> 00:30:27,201
You gals are
some of the best I ever met.

460
00:30:37,754 --> 00:30:41,174
- Thank you.
- For what? She knew you were right.

461
00:30:42,925 --> 00:30:45,094
And I guess I knew you were right, too.

462
00:30:49,682 --> 00:30:51,118
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

463
00:30:51,142 --> 00:30:52,852
<i>may I announce to you</i>

464
00:30:52,977 --> 00:30:56,856
<i>the lovely and mysterious Masqueradies?</i>

465
00:31:03,363 --> 00:31:05,948
Okay. Maybe I can put a glamor on you

466
00:31:06,032 --> 00:31:08,832
and then you can look like Maude,
which means you can sing. And then...

467
00:31:08,868 --> 00:31:11,204
I don't know the words
to this corny song.

468
00:31:11,287 --> 00:31:12,580
Why can't you do it?

469
00:31:13,122 --> 00:31:14,122
Wait.

470
00:31:14,665 --> 00:31:15,917
Where's Gideon?

471
00:31:50,076 --> 00:31:55,039
<i>Lately I've been wrung around</i>

472
00:31:55,373 --> 00:32:00,503
<i>Tossed and turned about</i>

473
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:07,885
<i>Could this be the end?</i>

474
00:32:09,804 --> 00:32:11,514
Sounds like she knows the words.

475
00:32:11,597 --> 00:32:16,102
<i>To my genuine surprise</i>

476
00:32:16,185 --> 00:32:21,274
<i>I've met the gaze of those blue eyes</i>

477
00:32:21,732 --> 00:32:28,197
<i>Doll face, are you pretend?</i>

478
00:32:31,617 --> 00:32:36,664
<i>She's my future favorite</i>

479
00:32:36,998 --> 00:32:40,793
<i>My love
No denying it</i>

480
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:49,385
<i>So very dizzy for this dame</i>

481
00:32:52,305 --> 00:32:57,226
<i>Take me down the boulevard</i>

482
00:32:58,102 --> 00:33:02,857
<i>Then around this crazy world of ours</i>

483
00:33:03,774 --> 00:33:09,280
<i>Please don't say it's all a game</i>

484
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:33,721
Zari, what's with the face?
Look around. Everyone's here.

485
00:33:33,804 --> 00:33:38,476
I just... I know I'm missing something.
What am I forgetting?

486
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:45,566
Me. Me. I'm forgetting me.
I should have been in hair and makeup.

487
00:33:45,942 --> 00:33:47,527
I haven't even done an outfit change.

488
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:48,611
Who cares?

489
00:33:49,779 --> 00:33:52,281
Look what's happening tonight
is a one-time special.

490
00:33:53,324 --> 00:33:55,785
Be in the moment. Here. Now.

491
00:34:00,915 --> 00:34:03,084
Let's dance before
some blondes steal the show.

492
00:34:03,459 --> 00:34:04,460
Okay.

493
00:34:13,636 --> 00:34:14,637
Rutabaga.

494
00:34:18,808 --> 00:34:20,285
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

495
00:34:20,309 --> 00:34:24,689
<i>the silver shooting sinners themselves,
the Bullet Blondes.</i>

496
00:34:42,832 --> 00:34:43,833
- Rutabaga.
- Mmm-hmm.

497
00:34:47,169 --> 00:34:50,590
Last time you saw Zari,
how did you end things?

498
00:34:50,965 --> 00:34:52,675
We're still together.
We didn't break up.

499
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:55,845
How's that working out?
What is the plan?

500
00:34:55,928 --> 00:34:57,680
Oh, my God. We love each other, Gary.

501
00:34:57,763 --> 00:34:58,782
You're not answering my question.

502
00:34:58,806 --> 00:35:02,018
It's not the... Not now, Gary.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

503
00:35:22,288 --> 00:35:24,040
You can't put it off forever, Nate.

504
00:35:24,123 --> 00:35:26,375
You need to discuss
what it means to be all in.

505
00:35:26,584 --> 00:35:29,545
Otherwise you'll always
have one foot out the door.

506
00:35:29,629 --> 00:35:31,380
- Or Totem.
- Shut up, Gary.

507
00:35:41,641 --> 00:35:46,687
<i>We've been forced to hide away
our hearts until a better day</i>

508
00:35:47,229 --> 00:35:51,567
<i>Now we are breaking down the door</i>

509
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:54,862
<i>Stand clear
Bear-cats coming through</i>

510
00:35:54,945 --> 00:35:57,531
<i>My dear, I'm so in love with you</i>

511
00:35:58,574 --> 00:36:02,286
<i>Hotsy totsy dancer on the floor</i>

512
00:36:03,746 --> 00:36:06,415
<i>She's my future favorite</i>

513
00:36:06,749 --> 00:36:09,168
<i>My love
No denying it</i>

514
00:36:09,251 --> 00:36:13,839
<i>So very dizzy for this dame</i>

515
00:36:14,757 --> 00:36:17,385
<i>Take me down the boulevard</i>

516
00:36:17,677 --> 00:36:20,096
<i>Then around this crazy world of ours</i>

517
00:36:20,262 --> 00:36:24,934
<i>Please don't say it's all a game</i>

518
00:36:26,894 --> 00:36:28,104
Wait. Where's Hoover?

519
00:36:28,938 --> 00:36:31,399
<i>Time flies, so savor it</i>

520
00:36:31,524 --> 00:36:36,153
<i>Let's toast and raise ourselves a glass</i>

521
00:36:36,862 --> 00:36:42,076
<i>Cheers to all the memories
Facing danger, solving mysteries</i>

522
00:36:42,451 --> 00:36:46,956
<i>In the present, future and the past</i>

523
00:36:48,124 --> 00:36:53,504
<i>Sweetheart, our love is made to
Sweetheart, our love is made to</i>

524
00:36:53,587 --> 00:36:59,135
<i>Sweetheart, our love is made to last</i>

525
00:37:06,767 --> 00:37:07,852
We're not sisters.

526
00:37:20,865 --> 00:37:24,660
Yo, that was incredible, Gideon.
Way to put those pipes to use.

527
00:37:25,536 --> 00:37:26,746
My voice was well rested.

528
00:37:27,246 --> 00:37:29,915
Way to croon, sweet cakes.

529
00:37:30,374 --> 00:37:33,043
Come out front
so the nice man can meet you.

530
00:37:34,795 --> 00:37:37,131
What's the big idea?
Where the hell is Maude?

531
00:37:37,465 --> 00:37:38,841
Far away from here by now.

532
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:42,136
Who the hell are you
and what happened to my girl?

533
00:37:42,219 --> 00:37:44,555
I'm Astra Logue, you idiot.

534
00:37:44,847 --> 00:37:47,391
And Maude is gone.
You'll never see her again.

535
00:37:47,683 --> 00:37:49,477
You think you're clever, huh?

536
00:37:50,728 --> 00:37:52,188
She'll come crawling back.

537
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:56,901
You know, where I grew up,
we had this knack of finding out

538
00:37:56,984 --> 00:37:59,695
what people were most afraid of
in the entire world.

539
00:38:00,279 --> 00:38:03,240
And you think
you're so tough and strong,

540
00:38:03,574 --> 00:38:04,742
but I know the truth.

541
00:38:05,367 --> 00:38:06,607
What you're really afraid of...

542
00:38:08,412 --> 00:38:10,331
Spiders, wasn't it?

543
00:38:12,041 --> 00:38:13,042
Yeah, right.

544
00:38:20,591 --> 00:38:21,592
Really?

545
00:38:23,093 --> 00:38:24,804
You're not afraid
of an infinite amount

546
00:38:24,887 --> 00:38:26,680
of tiny little spiders
all over your body?

547
00:38:28,974 --> 00:38:33,562
Crawling under your skin, scurrying into
your nose, ears, your mouth...

548
00:38:35,773 --> 00:38:38,359
You've seen what
my friend and I can do, Ross.

549
00:38:38,859 --> 00:38:42,905
So if you ever go after Maude,
if you even think about her...

550
00:38:43,364 --> 00:38:45,157
Spiders everywhere.

551
00:38:45,449 --> 00:38:46,700
Forever.

552
00:38:48,536 --> 00:38:52,206
- Gals help gals, you jerk.
- No.

553
00:38:55,334 --> 00:38:57,979
Hey, ladies, we're gonna try to make it
to the end of the Blondes' set.

554
00:38:58,003 --> 00:39:00,130
- Do you want to come?
- What are you talking about?

555
00:39:00,506 --> 00:39:01,507
Didn't you hear?

556
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:04,472
The Bullet Blondes are putting on
a performance right now at Chapeaux's.

557
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:06,554
We're gonna try to catch
the rest of the party.

558
00:39:06,637 --> 00:39:08,597
Legends. <i>Vámonos.</i>

559
00:39:14,979 --> 00:39:17,815
You're right about me and Zari.
We are a bit stuck.

560
00:39:18,607 --> 00:39:24,113
But I've been okay with it,
because I'm afraid of what comes next.

561
00:39:25,155 --> 00:39:27,783
Well, it sounds like you and Z
need to have the talk.

562
00:39:28,701 --> 00:39:33,455
And the Gare Bear,
he's here to talk after the talk.

563
00:39:35,082 --> 00:39:36,166
Thank you, Gary.

564
00:39:39,628 --> 00:39:42,965
It's enough for a small place,
but that's all I need.

565
00:39:44,383 --> 00:39:46,218
And I don't know
how I'll ever repay you.

566
00:39:46,677 --> 00:39:49,013
You just keep your doors open
for all of Chicago's misfits

567
00:39:49,221 --> 00:39:50,764
and we will call it even.

568
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:54,476
No, no, no.

569
00:40:10,701 --> 00:40:13,162
- Guys?
- Check the doors.

570
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:27,176
They were here.

571
00:40:43,525 --> 00:40:46,904
Don't worry, Legends.
We're on our way to the Big Apple.

572
00:40:54,244 --> 00:40:58,832
So, I mean, technically speaking, using
you two as bait to lure Hoover-Bot here

573
00:40:58,916 --> 00:41:01,835
was an inadvertently
brilliant stroke of genius on my part.

574
00:41:01,919 --> 00:41:05,547
Well, you still got a couple hours left
of calling the shots, so...

575
00:41:05,631 --> 00:41:08,258
I do appreciate the trust, Captain,

576
00:41:08,342 --> 00:41:11,971
but when it comes to robots,
you're talking to the wrong Zari.

577
00:41:13,597 --> 00:41:14,723
Oh, um...

578
00:41:14,807 --> 00:41:16,701
While I'm gone, will you guys keep
an eye out for my cell phone?

579
00:41:16,725 --> 00:41:18,477
It's MIA. Bye.

580
00:41:25,401 --> 00:41:27,027
Oh... What's up, guys?

581
00:41:29,363 --> 00:41:30,531
Huh... What did I miss?
