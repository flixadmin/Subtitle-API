1
00:00:02,316 --> 00:00:04,992
If you think I look at you
like a trophy, you're wrong.

2
00:00:05,002 --> 00:00:06,655
You're not good enough.

3
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:09,979
- Vilde, you're super pretty.
- But not pretty enough.

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:12,536
If you really want to get rid
of me, go on a date with me.

5
00:00:12,561 --> 00:00:15,868
Remember when I said you weren't
good enough? That was bullshit.

6
00:00:16,144 --> 00:00:17,180
Okay.

7
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:21,617
Why is it so hard to understand
people can be friends with their ex?

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,780
It's William. He wants to talk to you.

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,476
If you go out on a date with me,

10
00:00:28,525 --> 00:00:31,209
I'll stop using Vilde.

11
00:00:39,253 --> 00:00:41,903
MONDAY, 9:15 AM

12
00:00:52,207 --> 00:00:53,870
Hi. Hello.

13
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:55,735
Hi?

14
00:00:57,477 --> 00:00:59,806
We were wondering if you know Jonas.

15
00:00:59,865 --> 00:01:02,910
- From the first year.
- I think he's in 1STD.

16
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,751
Eh, yeah...

17
00:01:04,968 --> 00:01:07,244
Do you know if he's
together with someone?

18
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,900
No, I don't think so.

19
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:14,552
What about the girl
with the Head jacket?

20
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,309
Eh, Eva?

21
00:01:16,561 --> 00:01:17,960
Yes, Eva!

22
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,158
No, she's not his girlfriend.

23
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,440
Okay, great. Thanks!

24
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,327
- Hello.
- Hi!

25
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,201
What's up?

26
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:43,699
I didn't do my homework.

27
00:01:48,412 --> 00:01:50,335
***

28
00:01:50,455 --> 00:01:52,384
Have you talked to Jonas?

29
00:01:52,611 --> 00:01:54,240
Yeah, why?

30
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,540
What actually happened on Friday?

31
00:02:01,508 --> 00:02:03,225
His phone died.

32
00:02:05,461 --> 00:02:07,089
So...

33
00:02:07,148 --> 00:02:11,230
Did he have fun at the Elvebakken party?

34
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,775
They never even got there.

35
00:02:12,794 --> 00:02:17,384
They went to a third year
party. Do you know whose?

36
00:02:18,632 --> 00:02:20,329
Apparently it was really awesome.

37
00:02:20,359 --> 00:02:21,913
Lots of people from school were there.

38
00:02:21,968 --> 00:02:24,080
We should've known and gone there.

39
00:02:25,797 --> 00:02:27,490
Did he hook up with someone?

40
00:02:29,874 --> 00:02:31,310
I don't think so. Don't know.

41
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,450
Why?

42
00:02:33,995 --> 00:02:37,400
It seems like the only
thing you two talk about

43
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,580
is who he has hooked up with.

44
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,788
That's not the only thing we talk about!

45
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:45,809
Also about who I hook up with.

46
00:02:47,175 --> 00:02:48,932
You haven't hooked up

47
00:02:48,947 --> 00:02:51,192
with anyone since you've
broken up, have you?

48
00:02:51,489 --> 00:02:55,634
- But if I had...
- Maybe you should.

49
00:02:55,861 --> 00:02:58,111
- Hook up with someone?
- Hm-hm.

50
00:02:58,417 --> 00:03:01,655
I'd gladly hook up with someone,

51
00:03:01,729 --> 00:03:03,831
but I just haven't hit on anyone.

52
00:03:04,245 --> 00:03:05,632
What about Tinder?

53
00:03:05,923 --> 00:03:09,500
Tinder?! Okay... what happened to you?

54
00:03:09,521 --> 00:03:12,758
I think it'd be good for you

55
00:03:12,808 --> 00:03:15,601
to get out there a little.

56
00:03:17,703 --> 00:03:19,598
I'm not on Tinder.

57
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,073
Why not?

58
00:03:21,098 --> 00:03:22,998
Are you on Tinder?

59
00:03:23,012 --> 00:03:26,120
Me? No. Oh my god.

60
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,652
But you, Noora...

61
00:03:28,348 --> 00:03:31,700
Why don't we ever talk
about your love life?

62
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,657
We have Spanish now.

63
00:03:33,697 --> 00:03:35,912
Clock is ticking, and you
haven't done your homework.

64
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,321
Why are you changing the subject?

65
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,660
- ***
- Who did you hook up with last?

66
00:03:40,695 --> 00:03:43,117
I'm just saying we have Spanish now.

67
00:03:43,117 --> 00:03:44,780
Stop talking about hooking up.

68
00:03:44,814 --> 00:03:47,326
It's the only thing you care about.

69
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,053
I've never heard you
talk about anything else.

70
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,672
It's really sick.

71
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,000
Maybe you should get some help.

72
00:03:57,186 --> 00:04:00,314
- With Spanish or hooking up?
- Both!

73
00:04:00,852 --> 00:04:02,544
***

74
00:04:08,792 --> 00:04:10,332
TUESDAY, 11:50 AM

75
00:04:10,342 --> 00:04:12,900
Should we just be wallflowers then?

76
00:04:12,942 --> 00:04:15,563
It's not about being wallflowers.

77
00:04:15,613 --> 00:04:18,159
It's about how we present ourselves.

78
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:21,820
We shouldn't be perceived
as sexual objects.

79
00:04:21,835 --> 00:04:25,634
I don't want to be sexual objects,
I just want us to look pretty.

80
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,841
You use red lipstick. Because
it looks pretty on you.

81
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,529
That's not why I do it.

82
00:04:30,563 --> 00:04:33,652
It's because I think it's
nice. I don't do it for guys.

83
00:04:33,772 --> 00:04:35,207
What's the difference?

84
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,816
<i>You're really pretty today.</i>

85
00:04:36,826 --> 00:04:38,326
- <i>Happy Women's Day.</i>
- ***

86
00:04:38,336 --> 00:04:39,673
- <i>Looking forward to Friday.</i>
- ***

87
00:04:39,678 --> 00:04:42,111
It's going well. We got
"Brun og Blid" as a sponsor.

88
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,754
How did you do that?

89
00:04:44,312 --> 00:04:49,706
I've been doing a little
research after school.

90
00:04:51,454 --> 00:04:54,858
I'm not really sure if we
should have them as our sponsor.

91
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:57,499
Because I don't think I want us

92
00:04:57,523 --> 00:05:00,351
to present ourselves as sexual objects.

93
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:02,166
That's really important to me.

94
00:05:02,196 --> 00:05:04,862
But at the same time

95
00:05:04,896 --> 00:05:10,068
I want us to be seen as
beautiful individuals.

96
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:14,321
Above all we will
emphasize our femininity.

97
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:18,007
I think that "Brun og
Blid" is good for that.

98
00:05:31,225 --> 00:05:33,144
Why is everyone staring at Jonas?

99
00:05:33,264 --> 00:05:34,693
Didn't you hear?

100
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,740
No.

101
00:05:39,469 --> 00:05:42,509
There are rumors that he
got a third year to come.

102
00:05:43,723 --> 00:05:45,159
Come to what?

103
00:05:45,332 --> 00:05:47,260
Cum-come...

104
00:05:50,947 --> 00:05:53,908
He slept with a third year?

105
00:05:54,382 --> 00:05:56,913
He went down on her.

106
00:05:58,848 --> 00:06:00,230
Huh?

107
00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:02,515
He licked her.

108
00:06:06,572 --> 00:06:09,544
But Eva, you said
Norwegian guys didn't...

109
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,587
Hello.

110
00:06:20,301 --> 00:06:22,080
Happy Women's Day.

111
00:06:34,962 --> 00:06:38,292
- What course do you guys have now?
- Eh, Norwegian! Yeah.

112
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:42,822
Me too. Should we just go now?

113
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,677
- THURSDAY, 12:05 PM
- It's difficult,

114
00:06:58,141 --> 00:07:01,789
for Tinder to know that. It should
be in the bio. 14 centimeter.

115
00:07:01,848 --> 00:07:04,400
Hey you! Look who's on Tinder.

116
00:07:05,653 --> 00:07:10,119
- Tinder?
- Yes, Tinder! You have to come with me.

117
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,990
- Why should I come with?
- Excuse me?

118
00:07:13,172 --> 00:07:16,259
Check his friends. They
are fucking handsome.

119
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,999
They are second years at Handels.

120
00:07:18,029 --> 00:07:20,323
***

121
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,284
His name is Adam.

122
00:07:22,343 --> 00:07:24,401
Adam... Eva...

123
00:07:24,642 --> 00:07:25,906
It's perfect!

124
00:07:25,921 --> 00:07:28,906
- Then you can go with her!
- I'm going to Stavanger.

125
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,980
- You?
- I have basketball camp.

126
00:07:32,005 --> 00:07:34,320
It's my cousin's birthday.

127
00:07:34,364 --> 00:07:37,360
Noora! Come with me, please?

128
00:07:37,384 --> 00:07:40,420
You said I needed to meet more guys.

129
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:43,631
- I can't though. Sorry.
- You can't, really?

130
00:07:43,751 --> 00:07:45,477
***

131
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,741
Hey, Noora?

132
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,506
I'll just...

133
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:02,055
ask you straight out.

134
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,554
Are you lesbian?

135
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,555
- There's nothing wrong with being lesbian.
- No, no no no!

136
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,820
Vilde...

137
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:18,221
It's not weird that I think so!

138
00:08:18,502 --> 00:08:22,529
You don't have sex and you
don't want to talk about sex.

139
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,214
Just because I don't go around

140
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:27,835
talking about being keen on having sex...

141
00:08:28,398 --> 00:08:30,199
Doesn't mean I'm lesbian.

142
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,149
But what are you doing tomorrow?

143
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,249
It's Eskild's...

144
00:08:39,093 --> 00:08:40,741
birthday.

145
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,112
- Is he having a big party?
- No.

146
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:46,214
A small celebration.

147
00:08:46,278 --> 00:08:48,380
Not even a real celebration. Just...

148
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:57,659
Maybe we can meet up later

149
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,427
if you're going out?

150
00:09:48,404 --> 00:09:51,690
- Who was that?
- Her name is Jamila Bikarim.

151
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,231
Do you know each other?

152
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,220
She's engaged to my brother.

153
00:09:55,575 --> 00:09:56,700
Engaged?!

154
00:09:56,759 --> 00:09:59,424
- How old is she?
- She's 17.

155
00:10:02,548 --> 00:10:06,343
- Is it an arranged marriage?
- Huh?

156
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,429
Why would you get
married when you're 17?

157
00:10:12,744 --> 00:10:14,580
Because they want to have sex.

158
00:10:22,362 --> 00:10:24,580
That is great.

159
00:10:25,985 --> 00:10:28,758
FRIDAY, 6:58 PM

160
00:10:52,213 --> 00:10:55,840
_

161
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,700
Hello.

162
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:35,000
- You're so pretty. Where are you going?
- I'm not pretty.

163
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Okay...

164
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,011
I got a Facebook message
from Eva. Your friend.

She wrote:

166
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,749
Happy birthday!

167
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,098
You didn't say that it
wasn't your birthday?

168
00:11:47,281 --> 00:11:48,286
Huh?

169
00:11:48,406 --> 00:11:49,704
Not yet.

170
00:11:49,824 --> 00:11:52,590
You can't say that. I had to say

171
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:55,670
it was your birthday
because I have a date.

172
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,876
You have a date? With who?

173
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:00,555
An asshole called William.

174
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,662
William? As in...

175
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,366
Vilde's William?

176
00:12:05,381 --> 00:12:08,001
- He's not Vilde's William.
- Okay.

177
00:12:09,022 --> 00:12:11,941
- Drama.
- He really isn't Vilde's.

178
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:14,340
And you wanna know something?

179
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,370
I'm doing this for Vilde's sake.

180
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,521
You're going on a date with William

181
00:12:20,044 --> 00:12:22,960
- for Vilde's sake?
- Yep.

182
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,856
Okay, how is that related?

183
00:12:25,029 --> 00:12:26,899
He told Vilde

184
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,960
she wasn't good enough.

185
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:35,327
I have to go on a date with him,

186
00:12:35,677 --> 00:12:38,096
to get him to apologise to Vilde.

187
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:41,505
So you're not going
on a date with William

188
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,451
because you want to,
but to not hurt Vilde?

189
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,460
Yes!

190
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:50,234
She won't be hurt when she finds out

191
00:12:50,354 --> 00:12:52,504
you're dating him behind her back?

192
00:12:52,697 --> 00:12:54,833
- <i>Outside.</i>
- ***

193
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,896
I'm not dating William.

194
00:12:59,896 --> 00:13:02,664
I'm going on one date to get rid of him.

195
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,981
And anyway,

196
00:13:04,026 --> 00:13:06,868
she'll never find out about it.

197
00:13:07,362 --> 00:13:10,380
Because you won't tell Eva

198
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:14,018
that it's not your birthday, okay?

199
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:16,840
***

200
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:18,859
***

201
00:13:19,825 --> 00:13:21,449
***

202
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,828
Hi.

203
00:14:00,844 --> 00:14:02,028
Hi.

204
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,794
Are you ready?

205
00:14:07,719 --> 00:14:09,348
Ready for what?

206
00:15:44,008 --> 00:15:46,431
Are you coming out, or are
you just going to sit here?

207
00:15:49,817 --> 00:15:52,280
Really cool to just
sit there and be pissed.

208
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,452
Cocoa?

209
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,736
Do you see that church down there?

210
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,303
My grandparents lived
to the right of it.

211
00:17:32,405 --> 00:17:35,080
In a really big and creepy house.

212
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,258
They had paintings

213
00:17:39,748 --> 00:17:41,337
on every wall possible.

214
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,760
My brother said

215
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,229
the paintings came alive
and walked around at night.

216
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,483
There was just one room
that I liked, the TV room.

217
00:17:53,274 --> 00:17:55,420
Grandma called it the Blue Room.

218
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,089
Walls were blue.

219
00:18:00,573 --> 00:18:01,915
Chairs were blue.

220
00:18:02,256 --> 00:18:03,514
Pillows were blue.

221
00:18:04,205 --> 00:18:05,572
Vases were blue.

222
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,617
You know the wall-to-wall carpet?

223
00:18:11,992 --> 00:18:13,932
Where the carpet
covers the entire floor?

224
00:18:14,303 --> 00:18:17,190
Yes I know what wall-to-wall carpet is.

225
00:18:18,478 --> 00:18:20,280
That was blue, too.

226
00:18:27,268 --> 00:18:29,340
You're fucking with me, or what?

227
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,300
Hm? What?

228
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,040
Do you think I fall for that stuff?

229
00:18:35,662 --> 00:18:36,720
What?

230
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,320
Everything here.

231
00:18:40,903 --> 00:18:44,579
With the view, cocoa,

232
00:18:44,604 --> 00:18:48,078
carpet, and then you come
with that damn childhood story.

233
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,074
Did you see it in some high school movie

234
00:18:54,104 --> 00:18:56,655
and took note of it?

235
00:18:56,977 --> 00:18:58,295
Wow...

236
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:03,071
You're really cold.

237
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,198
I mean it.

238
00:19:06,669 --> 00:19:08,080
Okay...

239
00:19:10,277 --> 00:19:12,552
I won't talk about my
childhood stories anymore.

240
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,880
What do you want to talk about?

241
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,980
I don't want to talk about anything.

242
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:23,080
I don't want to get to know you.

243
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,639
I don't even want to be here.

244
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:27,284
Why are you here then?

245
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:29,440
Because you pressured me.

246
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,700
I actually didn't pressure you.

247
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,900
How did I pressure you?

248
00:19:36,922 --> 00:19:38,397
Because,

249
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:41,782
you sent Vilde messages
and you called her,

250
00:19:41,802 --> 00:19:43,252
just to get to me.

251
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,080
How is that pressuring someone?

252
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,680
Because she shouldn't think
there's something between us.

253
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,953
You're not just saying that?

254
00:19:51,968 --> 00:19:53,434
That there's nothing between us.

255
00:19:55,743 --> 00:19:59,869
You're twisting it. It's much
more complicated than that.

256
00:20:01,532 --> 00:20:03,205
It's not that complicated.

257
00:20:03,718 --> 00:20:05,663
You're lying to a
friend and you blame me.

258
00:20:16,254 --> 00:20:17,735
The point is that

259
00:20:18,376 --> 00:20:20,646
I'm not interested in you.

260
00:20:20,766 --> 00:20:22,660
And I never will be.

261
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,060
Why not?

262
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,097
You're controlling,

263
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,934
and selfish.

264
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,722
And you use people to get your way.

265
00:20:37,096 --> 00:20:39,016
You're cold,

266
00:20:40,022 --> 00:20:41,458
and selfish...

267
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,156
You already said selfish.

268
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,619
And that time in the school yard

269
00:20:45,643 --> 00:20:47,548
when you said Vilde wasn't good enough.

270
00:20:48,308 --> 00:20:50,600
How can you say something like that?

271
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,538
I didn't want her to like me.

272
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:59,708
Couldn't you have said
it in a better way?

273
00:20:59,828 --> 00:21:02,402
Why should I have said
that in a better way?

274
00:21:02,447 --> 00:21:03,977
To not hurt her.

275
00:21:05,042 --> 00:21:06,420
Hurt her?

276
00:21:08,378 --> 00:21:10,600
There's no point in not hurting her...

277
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:16,037
When I don't want her to like me.

278
00:21:16,051 --> 00:21:17,863
It's better to be clear

279
00:21:18,578 --> 00:21:20,394
so there won't be any doubt.

280
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:24,000
And destroy her self-image?

281
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,104
Do you really think
that's how it works?

282
00:21:26,224 --> 00:21:27,427
What?

283
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,501
It's not possible to
destroy her self-image

284
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:31,774
with one comment.

285
00:21:34,789 --> 00:21:36,247
In that case, I think her self-image

286
00:21:36,266 --> 00:21:37,948
had already been destroyed before that.

287
00:21:47,786 --> 00:21:49,554
But if you saw it from my side...

288
00:21:51,054 --> 00:21:52,791
It was Vilde who came to me.

289
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,958
She was keen on me.

290
00:21:55,152 --> 00:21:56,754
She wanted to sleep with me.

291
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,880
I didn't promise her anything.

292
00:22:05,727 --> 00:22:06,754
However,

293
00:22:06,971 --> 00:22:09,008
you called me out in the
middle of the school yard.

294
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,258
Does that make you good?

295
00:22:12,573 --> 00:22:14,065
Does that make you fair?

296
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,469
Shouldn't you have warm cocao?

297
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:47,159
No.

298
00:22:49,796 --> 00:22:51,320
I like the cold.

299
00:22:52,967 --> 00:22:54,795
Then it tastes like chocolate milk.

300
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:13,469
It's good that

301
00:23:14,207 --> 00:23:16,852
you apologised about telling Vilde

302
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:19,501
she's not good enough.

303
00:23:21,577 --> 00:23:23,480
- Is it?
- Hm-hm.

304
00:23:25,086 --> 00:23:26,128
Okay.

305
00:23:31,435 --> 00:23:33,295
I hope it was a smart plan,

306
00:23:34,534 --> 00:23:36,149
because now she likes me again.

307
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:39,660
I don't like her.

308
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,080
So then we'll end up in
the same place, won't we?

309
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,660
Hello?

310
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,261
Where?

311
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,280
Where are you?

312
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,520
We have to go.

313
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,943
What's up?

314
00:24:22,847 --> 00:24:24,122
I'll drive you home.

315
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,935
But just so that we're clear,

316
00:24:38,567 --> 00:24:40,719
so that there won't be
any misunderstandings.

317
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,805
I've made up for it now.

318
00:24:45,645 --> 00:24:47,520
I don't owe you anything.

319
00:24:49,435 --> 00:24:51,180
No, you don't owe me anything.
