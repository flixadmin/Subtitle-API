[Knocks] Hey, man,

5
00:02:48,546 --> 00:02:50,714
look at the sad sack I found
moping around the lobby.

6
00:02:50,748 --> 00:02:53,248
- Hey.
- Ho. Hey, there, Walt.

7
00:02:53,282 --> 00:02:54,783
- How you doing, buddy?
- Good.

8
00:02:54,817 --> 00:02:57,185
Listen, I'm sorry to drop
in on you out of the blue.

9
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:59,232
- No, no, no.
- If it's a bad time, I could...

10
00:02:59,267 --> 00:03:02,302
No, no. I'm just kind of settling into the
new digs here. What do you think, huh?

11
00:03:02,464 --> 00:03:05,567
Wow.
It is very nice.

12
00:03:05,601 --> 00:03:08,069
- Yeah. Congratulations again.
- Yeah.

13
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:10,223
- We're all very proud of you.
- Oh, well, thanks.

14
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:12,925
You know, my days of chasing
dirt-balls is over.

15
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,360
But I'll tell you what,
being a boss--

16
00:03:15,378 --> 00:03:17,196
own kind of grind,
you know what I'm saying?

17
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,615
Uh, Steve,
would you mind if--

18
00:03:19,649 --> 00:03:22,656
I've gotta run something by
Hank, if it's all right.

19
00:03:22,691 --> 00:03:25,728
Yeah. Yeah, hey, somebody's
gotta go chase the bad guys.

20
00:03:25,762 --> 00:03:27,547
- Walt, it's a pleasure seeing you again.
- Hey.

21
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:29,088
- Thanks again, Steve.
- Take care, all right?

22
00:03:29,106 --> 00:03:30,590
- Appreciate it.
- Sure.

23
00:03:31,742 --> 00:03:33,376
Hey. Whoa.
Look at that.

24
00:03:33,427 --> 00:03:35,094
- Jesus, Walt.
- Oh.

25
00:03:35,128 --> 00:03:37,120
- That's nice. Let me see that.
- Yeah.

26
00:03:37,155 --> 00:03:39,089
Wow. That's beautiful.

27
00:03:39,123 --> 00:03:41,024
Was it a birthday present?

28
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,450
Uh, yeah.

29
00:03:42,485 --> 00:03:44,452
Well, I mean,
not-- not really.

30
00:03:44,487 --> 00:03:46,464
I bought it for myself.

31
00:03:46,499 --> 00:03:47,999
Oh.

32
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,168
Hey, have a seat.

33
00:03:52,038 --> 00:03:55,040
New car, new watch.

34
00:03:55,108 --> 00:03:56,942
Ah, good for you.

35
00:03:56,976 --> 00:03:59,711
With all the curve balls that
were thrown at you this year,

36
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,706
you deserve to treat yourself.

37
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,308
[Chuckles]
I mean, as long as you got

38
00:04:03,342 --> 00:04:05,410
the money to spend, that is.

39
00:04:05,444 --> 00:04:07,520
So, how's Sky?

40
00:04:07,555 --> 00:04:11,392
Actually, she went
to work this morning.

41
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:13,161
She wanted to.

42
00:04:13,195 --> 00:04:15,496
She said she needed
to, you know,

43
00:04:15,531 --> 00:04:18,176
keep her mind occupied, and...

44
00:04:18,211 --> 00:04:20,579
- That's good. Great, actually.
- Yeah.

45
00:04:20,613 --> 00:04:22,560
I mean, as long as
you're all right with her

46
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,195
being on her own and stuff.

47
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,696
Yeah, well, you know,

48
00:04:25,731 --> 00:04:28,232
I'm right there with her
most of the time.

49
00:04:28,267 --> 00:04:30,802
And Mariano kind of
keeps an eye on her

50
00:04:30,836 --> 00:04:32,136
when I'm not, so...

51
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:33,538
- Good.
- Yeah.

52
00:04:33,572 --> 00:04:35,744
And what about the whole idea
of talking to somebody?

53
00:04:35,779 --> 00:04:38,414
I mean, you know,
Marie goes off about Dave

54
00:04:38,448 --> 00:04:41,024
like he's a rock star shrink,
you know?

55
00:04:41,058 --> 00:04:42,659
They come in like zombies,

56
00:04:42,693 --> 00:04:44,227
out like larks,
you know what I'm saying?

57
00:04:44,261 --> 00:04:45,228
That's great.

58
00:04:45,262 --> 00:04:48,224
Actually,
she already found someone.

59
00:04:48,243 --> 00:04:50,528
Yeah. Peter...

60
00:04:50,562 --> 00:04:52,597
Uh... hmm.

61
00:04:52,631 --> 00:04:54,932
I don't know why I'm drawing
a blank on his last name.

62
00:04:54,967 --> 00:04:57,696
Peter... anyway,
he's out in Rio Rancho.

63
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,716
He's supposed to be top notch.
Good. I'm glad you're on it.

64
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,040
That's not something
you wanna let fester.

65
00:05:03,392 --> 00:05:05,056
No. No, you don't.

66
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:07,091
You don't.

67
00:05:07,126 --> 00:05:10,928
Um, Hank,
I-- I just, uh...

68
00:05:11,104 --> 00:05:14,640
I wanted to thank you and Marie
for watching the kids.

69
00:05:14,674 --> 00:05:16,742
[Mutters]
No, it's-- it really is--

70
00:05:16,776 --> 00:05:18,677
- No--
- No, it's nice of you, and...

71
00:05:18,848 --> 00:05:21,984
I'd like to come by tonight and
see them if that's all right.

72
00:05:22,018 --> 00:05:24,620
Oh, of course. What do you mean?
You don't have to ask that.

73
00:05:24,654 --> 00:05:27,584
It's great having them.
They're great kids.

74
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:29,280
I appreciate that.

75
00:05:29,314 --> 00:05:30,781
I do.

76
00:05:36,288 --> 00:05:39,296
Something else
on your mind there, Walt?

77
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,536
Walt, feel free to, you know...

And I don't know
what to do, Hank.

81
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:59,839
I don't.

[Sighs] She...

83
00:06:04,296 --> 00:06:08,672
She says that I'm
a bad influence on the kids,

84
00:06:08,707 --> 00:06:10,824
and, uh,

85
00:06:10,859 --> 00:06:14,528
that I'm not not good for them.

86
00:06:14,562 --> 00:06:16,380
Aw, jeez, Walt.

87
00:06:16,414 --> 00:06:18,331
No.

00:06:18,349 --> 00:06:22,319
She thinks I'm a bad father.

89
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:24,960
I'm sorry.

90
00:06:24,995 --> 00:06:26,845
Hey, I mean,

00:06:26,896 --> 00:06:28,832
Sky and you got your issues,

92
00:06:28,866 --> 00:06:30,650
but, uh, that there--

That's-- that's...

00:06:32,866 --> 00:06:34,300
I mean, I'm no...

95
00:06:34,335 --> 00:06:36,936
I'm not an expert
on parenting or anything,

96
00:06:36,971 --> 00:06:38,621
but from where I'm sitting,

97
00:06:38,656 --> 00:06:41,216
I just-- I just don't
see it, you know?

98
00:06:41,251 --> 00:06:43,185
I mean, I...

99
00:06:43,219 --> 00:06:45,024
I think you're great
with the kids.

100
00:06:45,058 --> 00:06:46,492
I think you're great
with the kids.

101
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,828
You're a provider, uh,

102
00:06:48,862 --> 00:06:52,320
a role model, you know?

103
00:06:52,354 --> 00:06:55,223
Hell, the guts you showed
going toe-to-toe with cancer--

that's an inspiration to me, you know?

No, I've made mistakes,
you know?

- Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
- I'm gonna have a cup of coffee.

109

I'm gonna give you a moment to--
to just get it together there.

All right.

she's-- she's gonna be home soon.

Shut up!

00:08:55,476 --> 00:08:57,632
Give me her phone.

132
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,155
All right, Lydia.

133
00:09:03,189 --> 00:09:05,724
My friends here
don't know you like I do,

134
00:09:05,758 --> 00:09:09,824
so they're very kindly
giving you one last chance.

135
00:09:14,931 --> 00:09:16,898
There's your script.
Study it.

136
00:09:16,933 --> 00:09:18,833
In about 30 seconds,

137
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:22,011
I'm gonna dial Agent Schrader
on your line here,

138
00:09:22,046 --> 00:09:25,081
and you're gonna pass along this information,
and then we'll see what we see.

139
00:09:25,115 --> 00:09:27,936
But here are the rules...
If you yell for help,

140
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:31,424
try to give the man some kind of coded
message or otherwise tip him off,

141
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,793
I am gonna pull out my pistol

142
00:09:33,827 --> 00:09:36,095
and shoot you in the head.

143
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:39,032
Same goes for panicking,
breaking down into tears.

144
00:09:39,066 --> 00:09:41,056
Remember how
you like to do that?

145
00:09:41,091 --> 00:09:42,424
If it happens this time,

146
00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:45,561
I am going
to pull my pistol out,

147
00:09:45,595 --> 00:09:48,864
and I am going to
shoot you in the head.

148
00:09:48,898 --> 00:09:51,800
Look at me, not at them.

149
00:09:51,834 --> 00:09:55,328
Lydia, look at me.

150
00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:57,931
If you make Schrader suspicious

151
00:09:57,965 --> 00:09:59,232
in any way,

152
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,504
any way at all,

153
00:10:01,539 --> 00:10:03,573
tell me what's
gonna happen next.

154
00:10:03,608 --> 00:10:05,542
You'll pull out your gun
and shoot me.

155
00:10:05,576 --> 00:10:07,936
- And where will I shoot you?
- In the head.

156
00:10:07,954 --> 00:10:09,605
In the head.
That's right.

157
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:11,774
And it's a pistol, not a gun.

158
00:10:11,808 --> 00:10:14,110
I'm expecting precision here.

159

Yeah.
Um, computer's set.

161
00:10:18,877 --> 00:10:20,110
Okay, Lydia.

00:10:20,144 --> 00:10:24,512

Hank Schrader.
How can I help you, Ms. Quayle?

173
00:10:54,745 --> 00:10:58,047
Well, this is kind of
an odd, uh...

174
00:10:58,082 --> 00:11:00,288
It's just that I
was in our warehouse,

175
00:11:00,322 --> 00:11:02,223
supervising a shipment
of chemicals,

176
00:11:02,257 --> 00:11:04,392
when I noticed a device

177
00:11:04,426 --> 00:11:07,104
<i>on the bottom of one of our
barrels of methylamine.</i>

178
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:09,240
- A device?
<i>- Yeah. I-I guess</i>

179
00:11:09,274 --> 00:11:10,541
you'd call it that.

180
00:11:10,576 --> 00:11:12,176
I'm certainly no expert,

181
00:11:12,211 --> 00:11:15,936
but it-- it looks to me
like some kind of a--

182
00:11:15,971 --> 00:11:18,939
a tracking device
or-- or a GPS.

183
00:11:18,974 --> 00:11:22,080
- Huh.
<i>- So I was just wondering</i>

184
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:23,815
if maybe your people
put it there.

185
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,349
Not that it's
any of my business,

186
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:27,424
but the last thing
I wanna do is interfere

187
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:31,424
with a law enforcement operation
or a sting...

188
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,793
or whatever you call it.

189
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:36,228
So, I don't know.

190
00:11:36,263 --> 00:11:38,430
Maybe you could
give me some guidance?

191
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,866
Uh, well, I'll tell you what.

192
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:43,232
Set that barrel aside for me,
if you would,

193
00:11:43,267 --> 00:11:45,718
and I'll look into it
and get back to you.

194
00:11:45,752 --> 00:11:49,024
And in the meantime,
mum's the word, all right?

195
00:11:49,058 --> 00:11:51,443
Yeah. All right.
Sure thing.

196
00:11:51,494 --> 00:11:53,856
<i>Okay, great.
Thanks for the call, Ms. quayle.</i>

<i>I'm talking about.</i>

<i>[Gomez] No. Nobody from my
team planted anything. Why?</i>

206
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:18,236
<i>Oh, I don't know.</i>
<i>I figured as much.</i>

207
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:21,072
<i>All right. Thanks.</i>

208
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:24,192
I-I know what you're thinking,
but I didn't do it.

209
00:12:24,227 --> 00:12:26,044
I'm telling you,
I didn't plant that thing.

210
00:12:26,095 --> 00:12:27,095
Shut up.

211
00:12:27,129 --> 00:12:29,631
And there you have it,
like I said.

212
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:32,064
All right.
So now what?

213
00:12:32,098 --> 00:12:33,582
It's not the DEA's,

214
00:12:33,616 --> 00:12:36,035
so Schrader's probably thinking
some crew planted it,

215
00:12:36,086 --> 00:12:38,176
looking for a weak spot
to pull a heist.

216
00:12:38,211 --> 00:12:40,762
He's gonna send a team
over to that warehouse.

217
00:12:40,813 --> 00:12:42,614
He's gonna wire it
out the wazoo--

218
00:12:42,648 --> 00:12:44,499
Bugs, cameras,
the whole nine yards.

219
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,304
So the warehouse is too hot.

220
00:12:46,339 --> 00:12:48,773
Her supply
is useless to us now.

221
00:12:48,808 --> 00:12:52,320
It depends on how fast Schrader
can get his guys there.

222
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:54,756
We're 900 miles closer,
after all.

223
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:58,026
I say we keep listening,
suss out how much time we have.

224
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,768
If it's at least 12 hours,
then we head down there,

225
00:13:00,802 --> 00:13:02,670
use her security code
to gain access,

226
00:13:02,704 --> 00:13:05,005
and we take every barrel
we can get our hands on.

227
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,944
U-haul can only take
six or seven

228
00:13:06,978 --> 00:13:08,345
before the suspension
gives out.

229
00:13:08,379 --> 00:13:09,746
It's a stopgap.

230
00:13:09,764 --> 00:13:11,648
But right now,
it's the best we can do.

231
00:13:13,818 --> 00:13:16,186
[Whispering]
Well, what about her?

232
00:13:16,352 --> 00:13:19,587
[Mike sighs] You two drive

233
00:13:19,621 --> 00:13:22,190
the barrels back tonight.

234
00:13:22,224 --> 00:13:24,158
I'll deal with her.

235
00:13:24,193 --> 00:13:27,296
No! No, no, no.
You're making a mistake.

236
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:30,496
This-- this was not me!
I swear to God I didn't do it!

237
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:32,732
I don't know, man. It sounds like
she's telling the truth to me.

238
00:13:32,766 --> 00:13:36,002
She has a gun to her head, kid.

239
00:13:36,036 --> 00:13:38,604
Everyone sounds like Meryl
Streep with a gun to their head.

I'm sorry, Jesse.

241
00:13:40,607 --> 00:13:44,384
You're the one who wanted
to put it up to a vote.

It's two against one.

Okay.

00:13:48,055 --> 00:13:50,592
No. No! You can't kill me!
Come on!

Asshole.

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,642
[Whispering]
Aside... aside from the fact

270
00:14:57,676 --> 00:14:59,210
that we almost killed
this woman,

271
00:14:59,245 --> 00:15:02,180
all of those barrels
are already marked.

272
00:15:02,214 --> 00:15:04,256
We solve the problem we can.

273
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:07,192
This has not changed the
equation one iota for her.

Oh, come on!
You are not seriously

I hate to say it, but
she's-- she's right, Mike.

She saved our asses
by finding that thing.

279

She was saving herself.
She's a loose cannon.

280
00:15:24,747 --> 00:15:27,584
I am telling you, she will
turn a gun or a badge on us

281
00:15:27,618 --> 00:15:29,469
the first chance she gets.

282

The woman

283
00:15:31,522 --> 00:15:34,724
put a hit out on me.

284
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:36,768
Seriously?

285
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:39,137
Wait. A hit?

286
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:41,839
What?
Like the mafia?

287
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:45,280
Yeah, like the mafia.

288
00:15:45,314 --> 00:15:48,283
Hey! You still need methylamine,
don't you? Right?

289
00:15:48,317 --> 00:15:50,051
You wanna talk methylamine?

290
00:15:50,086 --> 00:15:52,192
Then tell your partner
to stop threatening me,

291
00:15:52,226 --> 00:15:53,827
and let's talk.

292
00:15:53,861 --> 00:15:56,229
Talk about what?
You heard.

293
00:15:56,264 --> 00:15:58,465
You can't even get us
a single barrel.

294
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,800
Who said anything
about barrels?

295
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:07,040
I'm talking about
an ocean of the stuff.

296
00:16:13,694 --> 00:16:15,595
Just give him a minute,
would you?

297
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,440
Trust him.

298
00:16:17,475 --> 00:16:18,875
"Trust him."

[Laughs]

300
00:16:23,881 --> 00:16:26,816
Okay.
So, let's hear it.

301
00:16:26,851 --> 00:16:30,144
Not without a guarantee that once I
tell you how to get what you want,

302
00:16:30,178 --> 00:16:31,912
I won't be killed anyway.

303
00:16:31,946 --> 00:16:34,688
- Fine. You have my word.
- Not good enough.

304
00:16:34,706 --> 00:16:36,190
[Chuckles]
Look, lady--

305
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:38,059
Do you have children?

306
00:16:38,093 --> 00:16:40,256
That has nothing
to do with this.

307
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:43,792
It's not a trick question.
Why don't you just answer it?

308
00:16:43,827 --> 00:16:46,495
Yes, I have children.
So what?

309
00:16:46,513 --> 00:16:49,184
You think that somehow
because we're both parents

310
00:16:49,235 --> 00:16:51,353
that I won't let my partner
do what's necessary?

311
00:16:51,404 --> 00:16:53,688
- Swear on their lives.
- Oh, what?

312
00:16:53,739 --> 00:16:56,032
Swear on your children's lives
that I won't be harmed.

313
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:58,251
Otherwise, how can I trust you?

314
00:16:58,285 --> 00:17:01,904
Look, you're
a smart businesswoman.

315
00:17:02,048 --> 00:17:03,998
You understand
the concept of leverage.

316
00:17:04,016 --> 00:17:05,632
Please don't patronize me.
I hate that.

317
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:07,984
You have none.

318
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:16,032
But trust has to work
both ways, Lydia.

319
00:17:16,066 --> 00:17:19,335
Is it true that you put
a hit out on Mike?

320
00:17:22,239 --> 00:17:23,339
Yes.

321
00:17:23,373 --> 00:17:25,607
- Why?
- I was scared.

322
00:17:26,877 --> 00:17:28,480
Of Mike?

323
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:30,465
Not at first.

324
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:33,218
There are men who used to work with
Gus Fring in custody right now.

325
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:35,887
Nine of them. They know
everything about me. Everything.

326
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:37,472
Some of them
even know about you,

327
00:17:37,506 --> 00:17:39,074
assuming you're
the master chemist

328
00:17:39,108 --> 00:17:40,809
they're always talking about.

329
00:17:42,244 --> 00:17:46,208
And if it's these nine
that you're worried about,

330
00:17:46,226 --> 00:17:48,310
why put the hit on Mike?

331
00:17:48,345 --> 00:17:50,246
I had no choice.
I'm not going to prison

332
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,381
and have my daughter raised
in some horrible group home.

333
00:17:52,415 --> 00:17:54,560
Do you have any idea
what those places are like?

334
00:17:54,595 --> 00:17:56,864
I gave him a list of names,

335
00:17:56,898 --> 00:17:59,099
but instead of handling it,
he's protecting them.

336
00:17:59,134 --> 00:18:00,960
So I hired someone else.
At that point,

337
00:18:00,961 --> 00:18:03,936
there was no option
but to add Mike to the list.

338
00:18:08,741 --> 00:18:11,910
This ocean of methylamine

339
00:18:11,944 --> 00:18:15,968
that you claim
you can get your hands on,

340
00:18:16,002 --> 00:18:19,221
how much are we
talking about, literally?

341
00:18:19,239 --> 00:18:22,258
How does 24,000 gallons sound?

342
00:18:25,536 --> 00:18:27,808
Once a week, on a Wednesday,

343
00:18:27,842 --> 00:18:29,777
a freight train
leaves the port of Long Beach

344
00:18:29,811 --> 00:18:32,012
loaded with
industrial chemicals.

345
00:18:32,047 --> 00:18:34,782
There's always at least one
tanker car full of methylamine,

346
00:18:34,816 --> 00:18:37,117
which we import from
a manufacturer in Guangzhou.

347
00:18:37,152 --> 00:18:40,192
The train travels east
through Arizona,

348
00:18:40,226 --> 00:18:42,561
stops at a rail yard
outside Flagstaff

349
00:18:42,612 --> 00:18:44,530
where it gets broken down
and rebuilt.

350
00:18:44,564 --> 00:18:46,400
But the methylamine
always moves on,

351
00:18:46,435 --> 00:18:48,936
destined for our pesticide
concerns in Texas and Oklahoma.

352
00:18:48,971 --> 00:18:51,968
Which means that it passes
right through your home state.

353
00:18:52,002 --> 00:18:54,971
There's a remote
three-mile stretch here,

354
00:18:55,005 --> 00:18:57,056
in Mckinley County.

355
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:59,058
That's where you do it.

356
00:19:00,527 --> 00:19:02,811
That's where
we do what, exactly?

357
00:19:02,862 --> 00:19:04,280
Get your methylamine.

358
00:19:04,314 --> 00:19:07,712
Like, rob it?
Like Jesse James?

359
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:10,548
You want the stuff? I'm offering you
enough to fill a swimming pool.

360
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:14,152
You are offering us a quick trip to prison.
That's what I'm hearing.

361
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:16,604
Stopping a train, post 9/11?

362
00:19:16,768 --> 00:19:18,752
You have any idea
how many alarms

363
00:19:18,787 --> 00:19:21,312
that's gonna set off
between here and D.C.?

364
00:19:21,347 --> 00:19:23,381
None, if you do it right here.

365
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:25,350
If a freight train
is stopped in transit

366
00:19:25,384 --> 00:19:27,452
anywhere other than
the usual yards or depots--

367
00:19:27,486 --> 00:19:29,760
Absolutely, a signal
will automatically alarm

368
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:32,096
the FRA and the TSA
Surface Division

369
00:19:32,131 --> 00:19:33,898
at the Department
of Homeland Security.

370
00:19:33,933 --> 00:19:35,633
But what you don't know,
and I do,

371
00:19:35,668 --> 00:19:38,944
because my job requires me to keep
track of my buyers' shipments--

372
00:19:38,979 --> 00:19:41,113
This is dark territory.

373
00:19:41,148 --> 00:19:43,749
- What's that?
- Train-speak for an area of no contact.

374
00:19:43,784 --> 00:19:45,760
It's a dead zone.

375
00:19:45,794 --> 00:19:47,512
No automated
supervision system,

376
00:19:47,563 --> 00:19:50,098
no alarms,
no contact with control.

377
00:19:50,132 --> 00:19:52,000
What about cell phones?

378
00:19:52,034 --> 00:19:54,400
- Crew could just call the cops.
- No cellular either.

379
00:19:54,435 --> 00:19:57,503
I'm telling you,
it's the perfect place.

380
00:19:57,538 --> 00:19:59,839
You'd have time enough
to stop the train,

381
00:19:59,873 --> 00:20:02,336
siphon off as much methylamine
as you can carry,

382
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:03,804
and get away
before the police--

383
00:20:03,822 --> 00:20:05,739
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

384
00:20:05,773 --> 00:20:08,672
Assuming we can stop
a moving train,

385
00:20:08,706 --> 00:20:10,674
how do we know
we have the right one?

386
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,676
And which tanker car is which?

387
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,878
I can't believe that they
would advertise their contents.

388
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:17,632
Once the train
gets rebuilt in Flagstaff,

389
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:20,301
a final manifest gets uploaded
to my company's server.

390
00:20:20,336 --> 00:20:23,776
I'll have it for you sometime
between midnight and 2:00 A.M.

391
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:26,178
That'll give you at least
six hours of lead time.

392
00:20:26,213 --> 00:20:27,947
Keep in mind,

393
00:20:28,096 --> 00:20:31,072
I'm taking a huge risk
supplying this information.

394
00:20:31,106 --> 00:20:33,141
I expect to be paid.
[Scoffs]

395
00:20:35,177 --> 00:20:37,411
W-we can talk
percentages later.

396
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,968
You know what this means,
don't you?

397
00:20:40,002 --> 00:20:41,836
We've gotta off the crew.

398
00:20:41,871 --> 00:20:43,538
How do you figure?

399
00:20:43,572 --> 00:20:45,573
Well, if we don't, the
engineer's gonna call the cops

400
00:20:45,608 --> 00:20:47,680
as soon as he
gets out of the dead zone.

401
00:20:47,714 --> 00:20:50,216
- It's only three miles long.
- But we're way out in the boonies.

402
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,118
I don't care
if it's in the Gobi desert.

403
00:20:52,152 --> 00:20:55,520
Once they get word,
the FBI and Homeland Security

404
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:57,322
are gonna swoop down
with choppers on us

405
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:58,957
so fast it'll make
our heads spin.

406
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:01,760
And there is no hiding
in that open country.

407
00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:03,662
- How many in the crew?
[Lydia] - Just two--

408
00:21:03,696 --> 00:21:05,163
An engineer and a conductor.

409
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:06,965
Assuming there are
no security guards.

410
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:10,304
No guards. It's not like we're
carrying nuclear warheads.

411
00:21:10,355 --> 00:21:12,272
Wait. Two guys.

412
00:21:12,307 --> 00:21:14,496
Can't we just
tie them up or something?

413
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:17,099
And then what?
Even if we wear a mask,

414
00:21:17,133 --> 00:21:19,634
we're leaving
two witnesses behind.

415
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:21,436
Bottom line,

416
00:21:21,471 --> 00:21:23,520
I have done this
long enough to know

417
00:21:23,554 --> 00:21:26,336
that there are
two kinds of heists:

418
00:21:26,371 --> 00:21:29,239
Those where the guys
get away with it

419
00:21:29,274 --> 00:21:31,725
and those that leave witnesses.

420
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,920
[Scoffs] Give me a break.

421
00:21:33,955 --> 00:21:35,822
You guys were gonna murder me.

422
00:21:35,857 --> 00:21:38,525
I thought
you were professionals.

423
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,992
[Gibberish]

424
00:21:41,043 --> 00:21:44,212
Can you say "ASAC"?

425
00:21:44,247 --> 00:21:46,648
"Aaay-SAC."
Can you say that?

426
00:21:46,682 --> 00:21:49,367
Say,
[Singsong voice] "ASAC Schrader."

427
00:21:49,402 --> 00:21:51,328
If those turn out
to be her first words,

428
00:21:51,362 --> 00:21:52,996
I will beat you with my shoe.

429
00:21:53,031 --> 00:21:54,865
Don't listen to him, Holly.

430
00:21:54,899 --> 00:21:57,367
Aw, I'm just telling it
like it is, babe.

431
00:21:57,504 --> 00:21:59,905
Boss man.
I'm the boss man.

432
00:21:59,939 --> 00:22:01,888
Say, "boss man."

433
00:22:01,922 --> 00:22:04,473
Am I the boss man?
I'm the boss.

434
00:22:04,508 --> 00:22:06,475
Hey, that better be
something from a boob

435
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:08,394
instead of some fake soy crap.

436
00:22:08,428 --> 00:22:11,007
- Yeah, yeah.
- My little girl--

437
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:13,359
- Your little girl. Oh.
- ...deserves the real McCoy.

438
00:22:13,394 --> 00:22:14,510
[Fussing]

439
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,829
- Oh, no. See?
- Okay.

440
00:22:15,863 --> 00:22:18,665
She doesn't want it.
No, she wants me.

441
00:22:18,716 --> 00:22:21,051
She wants me.

442
00:22:21,085 --> 00:22:22,418
[Sighs]

443
00:22:22,436 --> 00:22:26,112
Yeah, my little girl,
'cause I'm not giving her back.

444
00:22:26,147 --> 00:22:27,447
Yeah, I know.

445
00:22:27,481 --> 00:22:29,549
What about emo McGee?

446
00:22:29,584 --> 00:22:31,685
Has he come out
of his room today?

447
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,107
Barely.

448
00:22:33,141 --> 00:22:34,875
When he does, he barely talks.

449
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:37,128
Yeah, well, what do
you expect, you know?

450
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,315
His parents treat him
like he's a baby there.

451
00:22:41,684 --> 00:22:43,776
[Babbling]

452
00:22:48,382 --> 00:22:51,384
Flynn, do you want me to
heat up some of that lasagna

453
00:22:51,418 --> 00:22:53,600
to hold you over till dinner?

454
00:22:53,634 --> 00:22:54,801
No.

455
00:22:54,836 --> 00:22:56,970
Hey, I picked up <i>Heat</i>
on BluRay.

456
00:22:57,004 --> 00:22:58,592
Wanna watch it with me later?

457
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:00,194
No.

458
00:23:00,228 --> 00:23:03,680
And you can keep
talking about me now.

459
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:10,654
Well, if no one else is gonna
offer an opinion, I will.

460
00:23:10,688 --> 00:23:12,672
We do it
the old-fashioned way.

461
00:23:12,706 --> 00:23:14,674
We hit skid row,
the Crystal Palace,

462
00:23:14,708 --> 00:23:16,275
all the halfway houses,

463
00:23:16,293 --> 00:23:18,044
scrounge up about
a dozen skells,

464
00:23:18,078 --> 00:23:20,224
and put them to work
smurfing cold pills.

465
00:23:20,258 --> 00:23:22,159
You mean switch back
to a pseudo cook.

466
00:23:22,177 --> 00:23:24,128
You're the chemist.
Admittedly,

467
00:23:24,162 --> 00:23:26,240
it's gonna
cut down on our output.

468
00:23:26,275 --> 00:23:28,593
Like a factor of four or five.

469
00:23:28,627 --> 00:23:32,013
It also means that
we will eat $80,000

470
00:23:32,047 --> 00:23:34,382
we just invested
in our new lab equipment,

471
00:23:34,416 --> 00:23:36,928
which is only good
for a P2P cook.

472
00:23:36,962 --> 00:23:39,364
You know, I don't have
to do the math to know

473
00:23:39,398 --> 00:23:41,916
that we'd be making
a fraction of the profit.

474
00:23:41,951 --> 00:23:46,816
And making less money
is better than making nothing.

475
00:23:46,851 --> 00:23:50,086
Oh, yeah, Mike?
Well, why don't you tell us why?

476
00:23:50,121 --> 00:23:53,323
Why is making nothing
not an option?

477
00:23:53,357 --> 00:23:55,072
- Walter--
- Let me tell you why.

478
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:57,541
It's because of your nine
guys in lockup, right?

479
00:23:57,575 --> 00:23:59,510
You broke it, you pay for it.

480
00:23:59,544 --> 00:24:01,144
And we've talked about
this plenty already.

481
00:24:01,162 --> 00:24:03,392
Well, maybe we better
talk about it a little more,

482
00:24:03,426 --> 00:24:05,627
because what it sounds like
you're telling me, Mike,

483
00:24:05,662 --> 00:24:07,329
is that from now on,

484
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:10,368
we have no choice but to do
this piddling pseudo cook

485
00:24:10,403 --> 00:24:12,504
so that we can pay back
your guys.

486
00:24:12,538 --> 00:24:15,690
Or else what? Or else they're gonna
rat on us, and we end up in prison.

487
00:24:15,725 --> 00:24:19,264
Yeah? And it sounds like
what you're telling me, Walter,

488
00:24:19,298 --> 00:24:21,766
is that you
wanna do this heist,

489
00:24:21,801 --> 00:24:24,960
even if it means killing
a couple of innocent men.

490
00:24:24,994 --> 00:24:27,296
That what you want?

491
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:28,964
You know, I don't know why

492
00:24:28,998 --> 00:24:31,168
you insist on putting
words in my mouth here.

493
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:33,487
What if we can
rip off that train,

494
00:24:33,521 --> 00:24:38,720
and no one ever knows
it got robbed?

495
00:24:48,963 --> 00:24:52,032
[Wind howling]

496
00:24:52,066 --> 00:24:53,984
Maybe...

497
00:24:58,752 --> 00:25:01,353
Just maybe.

498
00:25:11,765 --> 00:25:14,272
It'll come from that direction.

499
00:25:41,664 --> 00:25:43,665
775...

500
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,024
800...

501
00:25:50,376 --> 00:25:52,894
[Chuckles] Oh.

502
00:25:52,929 --> 00:25:56,114
814.
[Laughing]

503
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,118
Wow.
Wait a minute.

504
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,470
It's perfect!
Yeah, we do it here.

505
00:26:11,505 --> 00:26:12,805
[Laughs]

506
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:15,104
We do it right here.

507
00:26:26,633 --> 00:26:28,768
How are we looking, Mike?

508
00:26:35,226 --> 00:26:37,043
All clear.

509
00:26:37,078 --> 00:26:38,545
<i>Copy that.</i>

510
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:47,968
[Man] Go down, go down.

511
00:26:47,987 --> 00:26:49,637
All right.

512
00:26:49,672 --> 00:26:51,639
That's good, Fernando.

513
00:26:52,941 --> 00:26:54,909
[Backup signal beeping]

514
00:27:06,912 --> 00:27:08,580
[Clears throat] All right.

515
00:27:10,566 --> 00:27:12,896
This one.

516
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:14,063
Whoo.

517
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:19,419
[Jesse] - You good?
- Yeah.

518
00:27:23,872 --> 00:27:25,806
- What's your name again?
- Todd.

519
00:27:25,841 --> 00:27:27,474
Todd, on the day,

520
00:27:27,509 --> 00:27:29,568
are you gonna be able
to make this climb?

521
00:27:29,602 --> 00:27:31,870
Yes, sir.
I'll be ready.

522
00:27:31,905 --> 00:27:33,906
All right.

523
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,841
You mind if I ask you
a question?

524
00:27:35,875 --> 00:27:37,209
No. Go ahead.

525
00:27:37,243 --> 00:27:39,776
Well, I get why we want
the tank for the methylamine.

526
00:27:39,811 --> 00:27:42,412
But why this other one
for the water?

527
00:27:42,463 --> 00:27:44,608
Well...

528
00:27:44,643 --> 00:27:46,977
Jesse, it's your idea.

529
00:27:47,012 --> 00:27:48,946
You wanna fill him in?

530
00:27:48,964 --> 00:27:50,648
It's all about the weight, yo.

531
00:27:50,682 --> 00:27:52,616
The tanker
we're gonna hit--

532
00:27:52,768 --> 00:27:55,136
it gets weighed once when it
gets loaded in Long Beach,

533
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:58,080
and then again when
it's unloaded in Texas.

534
00:27:58,114 --> 00:28:00,249
If the weights don't match,

535
00:28:00,283 --> 00:28:02,284
the train company's gonna know
it got robbed.

536
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:03,786
Okay.

537
00:28:03,853 --> 00:28:06,752
Boosting methylamine from a
train is, like, a major rap.

538
00:28:06,786 --> 00:28:10,105
The point is,
no one other than us

539
00:28:10,139 --> 00:28:13,312
can ever know that
this robbery went down.

540
00:28:13,346 --> 00:28:14,763
Nobody.

541
00:28:14,781 --> 00:28:16,399
You got it?

542
00:28:18,602 --> 00:28:20,569
Yeah. Absolutely.

543
00:28:20,604 --> 00:28:22,788
Are you sure?

544
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:24,673
Yes, sir.

545
00:28:24,707 --> 00:28:26,688
With all that said,

546
00:28:26,722 --> 00:28:29,207
the whole thing relies on us

547
00:28:29,241 --> 00:28:31,176
replacing the weight
of methylamine we steal

548
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,644
with the same weight in water.

549
00:28:32,678 --> 00:28:34,912
Right on. So they'll never
know we hit them. Cool.

550
00:28:34,946 --> 00:28:37,248
Aqueous methylamine
is water-based,

551
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:39,456
yet it weighs
slightly less than water.

552
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:41,708
So, we will be removing

553
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:44,594
a thousand gallons of methylamine
from the tanker car,

554
00:28:44,612 --> 00:28:45,995
but replacing it

555
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:49,312
with about nine-tenths
of that volume in water,

556
00:28:49,346 --> 00:28:53,312
which comes to
900.24 gallons.

557
00:28:53,346 --> 00:28:55,214
Actually, Jesse,

558
00:28:55,248 --> 00:28:57,015
let's make that an even 920

559
00:28:57,050 --> 00:29:00,256
to account for spillage and
whatever will remain in the hose.

560
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:01,958
How we doing, by the way?

561
00:29:01,992 --> 00:29:04,064
Uh, 850.

562
00:29:04,099 --> 00:29:06,100
- We're almost there.
- All right.

563
00:29:06,134 --> 00:29:08,002
But won't they figure out
they got robbed anyway

564
00:29:08,036 --> 00:29:09,856
on account of getting
watered-down methylamine?

565
00:29:09,874 --> 00:29:12,526
Well, out of 24,000 gallons,

566
00:29:12,544 --> 00:29:17,063
it'll only amount to about
four percent dilution, so...

567
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:20,287
But, yes, you're right.
They will notice.

568
00:29:20,321 --> 00:29:24,064
At which point,
they will blame China

569
00:29:24,115 --> 00:29:27,700
for sending
a marginally weaker batch.

570
00:29:27,752 --> 00:29:31,456
Damn, you guys thought
of everything.

571
00:29:37,646 --> 00:29:39,781
[Knocking on door]

572
00:29:39,815 --> 00:29:41,952
[Skyler] Flynn...

573
00:29:41,987 --> 00:29:44,755
[Knocking]
Flynn, open the door.

574
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:47,808
Just come out and talk to me.

575
00:29:47,842 --> 00:29:51,232
[Walter, Jr.] I'm staying.
That's all I have to say.

576
00:29:55,704 --> 00:29:57,638
What's going on?

577
00:29:57,673 --> 00:30:00,704
You got what you wanted,
that's what.

578
00:30:00,739 --> 00:30:03,168
Congratulations.

579
00:30:03,202 --> 00:30:05,136
[Scoffs]

580
00:30:14,208 --> 00:30:16,343
[Knocks]
It's me. Open up.

581
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,708
[Sighs]

582
00:30:19,743 --> 00:30:22,400
Come on, Junior.
I'm not gonna ask twice. [Knocks]

583
00:30:23,785 --> 00:30:25,069
What?

584
00:30:25,103 --> 00:30:27,104
You know what.

585
00:30:27,139 --> 00:30:30,048
Are you seriously kicking
me out of my own house?

586
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:31,917
Are you seriously doing that?

587
00:30:31,951 --> 00:30:34,336
We are not kicking you
out of anywhere, son.

588
00:30:34,371 --> 00:30:35,838
We love you.

589
00:30:35,872 --> 00:30:38,274
And this is your house
as much as it is ours.

590
00:30:38,308 --> 00:30:41,312
But your mom and I need some
time alone, and you know that.

591
00:30:41,347 --> 00:30:42,764
We explained that to you.

592
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:44,349
You haven't
explained jack shit.

593
00:30:44,383 --> 00:30:47,456
You want me out?
Explain to me why.

594
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:49,357
Why do I have to go
to Uncle Hank's?

595
00:30:49,375 --> 00:30:52,416
Give me the exact reason,
or I'm not going anywhere.

596
00:30:53,951 --> 00:30:55,902
This is not gonna be a debate.

597
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,888
What's going on?

598
00:30:57,922 --> 00:31:00,128
Why can't anybody
tell me anything?

599
00:31:00,146 --> 00:31:02,698
I want one good reason.

600
00:31:04,433 --> 00:31:07,776
Because we're your parents,
and you're our child.

601
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:10,496
That's reason enough.
Now, please, do as I ask.

602
00:31:12,699 --> 00:31:14,600
Now.

603
00:31:18,672 --> 00:31:20,406
It'll pass.
He'll understand.

604
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,642
Don't start, Walt.

605
00:31:22,676 --> 00:31:25,632
I won't change my mind
about you.

606
00:31:26,967 --> 00:31:28,868
Ever.

607
00:31:28,902 --> 00:31:31,070
Well, I don't accept that.
You're my wife.

608
00:31:31,088 --> 00:31:33,952
I'm not your wife,
I'm your hostage.

609
00:31:35,137 --> 00:31:39,056
But since you insist
on keeping me imprisoned,

610
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,834
I'll make you a deal.

611
00:31:40,885 --> 00:31:44,544
I will launder your money,
I'll keep your secrets,

612
00:31:44,578 --> 00:31:47,520
but the kids will stay
at Hank and Marie's,

613
00:31:47,555 --> 00:31:50,323
where they have a chance
of being safe.

614
00:31:52,093 --> 00:31:55,462
Think you've seen
too many movies.

615
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:59,360
Our children are not in danger.

616
00:31:59,394 --> 00:32:01,795
Just a couple of days ago,

617
00:32:01,813 --> 00:32:04,896
you told me that a man
held a gun to your head.

618
00:32:04,914 --> 00:32:07,733
You said it like
it was a point of pride.

619
00:32:07,767 --> 00:32:10,048
There's nothing you can say
that'll convince me

620
00:32:10,082 --> 00:32:12,951
there won't come a day that
somebody will knock on that door,

621
00:32:12,985 --> 00:32:16,121
looking to harm you
or me or all of us.

622
00:32:16,155 --> 00:32:20,256
And when that day comes,
the children cannot be here.

623
00:32:22,476 --> 00:32:24,677
You agree to that,

624
00:32:24,711 --> 00:32:26,272
and I will be

625
00:32:26,306 --> 00:32:29,776
whatever kind of partner
you want me to be.

626
00:32:42,976 --> 00:32:44,576
Okay.

627
00:32:50,416 --> 00:32:53,018
By the way,
