00:41:11,855 --> 00:41:14,189
when literally all of you told me not to,

994
00:41:14,191 --> 00:41:15,257
so everything that's happened

995
00:41:15,259 --> 00:41:16,625
up until this point, it's on me,

996
00:41:16,627 --> 00:41:19,094
but this has to be a group decision.

998
00:41:21,532 --> 00:41:22,864
[computer beeping]

999
00:41:25,169 --> 00:41:27,035
Come on.

1000
00:41:35,045 --> 00:41:37,245
Well...

1001
00:41:38,849 --> 00:41:41,283
I guess this is good-bye.

1002
00:41:41,285 --> 00:41:44,219
No, it's not.

1003
00:41:44,221 --> 00:41:46,388
I told you, we're a team.

1004
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:49,124
Now you're a part of it.

1005
00:41:49,126 --> 00:41:50,459
We're gonna help you save Jesse.

1006
00:41:50,461 --> 00:41:53,228
We're not sending you through alone.

1007
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:55,263
We're going to Earth-2.
