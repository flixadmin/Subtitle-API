1
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:52,208
<i>Ashwathama is dead.</i>

2
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:53,625
<i>The elephant.</i>

3
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:28,708
Salutations to the Creator, Brahma.

4
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,500
The utterance of whose name...

5
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:42,750
The end of the Pandavas!

6
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:52,541
Even though Abhimanyu isn't here,

7
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:56,083
you're carrying the last heir
of the Pandavas in your womb.

8
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:57,666
Be brave.

9
00:02:57,875 --> 00:02:59,041
Everything will be alright.

10
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:06,708
If you're here to kill me,
go ahead, Krishna.

11
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:11,500
I'm not Arjuna
to listen to your teachings.

12
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,625
What you've done,
is a greater sin

13
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:16,458
than any of the other
atrocities of Kurukshetra.

14
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:19,916
How could you stoop so low,
in spite of being the son of Dronacharya?

15
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,916
You have no right to utter
my father's name, Krishna!

16
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:30,041
You were there.

17
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:33,541
You could've stopped his death
if you wanted to!

18
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:50,083
<i>You have been the protector
Of creation for ages</i>

19
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:53,291
<i>You're the assassin of sinners</i>

20
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:57,291
<i>The one who bestows hell upon them</i>

21
00:04:57,666 --> 00:05:00,625
<i>There is no other savior except you</i>

22
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:02,791
Ashwathama...

23
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:05,625
Even Dronacharya
could not escape his karma.

24
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:07,833
You attacked an unborn baby.

25
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,291
You must face the consequences of that.

26
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:14,208
Alright then, spin your <i>chakra</i>
and kill me as a punishment.

27
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:16,291
Death isn't your punishment, Ashwathama.

28
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:17,958
It's your salvation.

29
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:22,583
Over time, all the
Pandavas will be deceased.

30
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:24,458
My body will perish.

31
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,250
This yuga will reach an end.

32
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,958
But you won't face death.

33
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:33,041
You will beg for death.

34
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,666
But you will never die.

35
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:39,916
I curse you as such!

36
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:42,833
Is there no atonement for me?

37
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:44,916
You wanted to kill me now.

38
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,458
But one day, you'll have to save me.

39
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:50,500
Me?

40
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,041
Kali Yuga is approaching.

41
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:53,416
Kali is arriving.

42
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,750
When unrighteousness increases...

43
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:58,791
and darkness engulfs the world,

44
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,416
I must reincarnate again.

45
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:01,500
In that yuga,

46
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:04,083
Kali is going to be powerful enough
to cause hindrance to my birth.

47
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:07,125
That's when you must
safeguard my birth haven.

48
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,666
When the air is filled with toxins...

49
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:12,416
When River Ganga is
devoid of its last drop...

50
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,791
When this gem finds
its way back to you...

51
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:18,291
then you can assume...

52
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,416
that the time has come.

53
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:48,708
<i>I stand at the end of time</i>

54
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:57,791
<i>There is dense darkness, it is infinite</i>

55
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:06,041
<i>There is sin, there is destruction</i>

56
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:15,625
<i>Keshav, why don't you come here?</i>

57
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:19,625
<i>The earth is mortal, it demands God</i>

58
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:23,583
<i>Come as liberation!</i>

59
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:25,458
<i>It is dark inside</i>

60
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:27,458
<i>The sky is dark</i>

61
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:31,625
<i>Tear through time and come!</i>

62
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:35,166
<i>Take birth from the womb...</i>

63
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:39,500
<i>of the earth and come</i>

64
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:43,541
<i>Come, the cycle of creation spins</i>

65
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:48,416
<i>Come as karma</i>

66
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:52,458
<i>Keshav...</i>

67
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:58,958
<i>When will you come here?</i>

68
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:42,291
What's this?

69
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:44,125
I don't know.

70
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:49,958
Brother, do you have some water?

71
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:52,750
Ma'am, some water, please?

72
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,375
Have you dried out from washing
away all our sins, Mother Ganga?

73
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:22,291
Where have you come from?

74
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:24,958
Nobody gives
water for free here.

75
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:25,916
Did you know that?

76
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:27,416
No, I didn't.

77
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:31,500
In fact, I've never stepped
out of my village before.

78
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:32,916
What are you doing here now?

79
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:37,333
Come here, I'll tell you.

80
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,791
Do you see that?

81
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,208
A star shining
in broad daylight.

82
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:48,458
So what?

83
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,625
It appeared three days ago.

84
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:51,625
So what?

85
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:55,208
It first appeared 6000 years ago.

86
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:56,500
This is the second time.

87
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:57,458
So what?

88
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:00,250
So...

89
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,083
What's up with you two?

90
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:04,208
Is this your sister?

91
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:09,041
Can't you see that I'm a boy?

92
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:13,666
Okay, my boy.

93
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:16,708
Well, why are you guys going to Kashi?

94
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,541
Do we have anywhere else to go?

95
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:22,250
Hey!

96
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:24,375
Look!

97
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:27,916
We've reached Kashi!

98
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:31,625
The last standing city in this world.

99
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:34,166
The first ever city to exist on Earth.

100
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:28,375
Wow!

101
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:44,208
When will they open that gate?

102
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:46,250
Once I have a million units,

103
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,375
I'll definitely get inside.

104
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,833
They have everything there.

105
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:51,208
They have real flowers as well.

106
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:52,833
Of course, they will.

107
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:55,750
After sucking all resources from Earth...

108
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,375
they obviously have everything in there.

109
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:01,791
Who's up there?

110
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,500
The Guardian of the Complex.

111
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:09,000
The 200 year old warden.

112
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:11,583
Supreme Yaskin.

113
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:31,916
Don't you know God is banned
in Kashi these days, you old man?

114
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:37,875
The Complex will kill
you if they hear of this.

115
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:40,416
No, sir. Please.

116
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:43,750
Why is your God seated on a dog?

117
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:45,750
What's his name?

118
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,833
I don't recall, sir.

119
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:49,291
But...

120
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,666
Everyone believes he
is the protector of Kashi.

121
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:58,125
Boys!

122
00:12:59,041 --> 00:12:59,958
New merchandise.

123
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:04,291
Hold. Hold. Stop the vehicle.

124
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:17,291
Pull all the girls aside.

125
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:39,541
She's positive.

126
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:43,666
What's wrong?

127
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,583
Where are you taking her?

128
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:45,500
- Papa!
- Saanu...

129
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:47,041
- Papa!
- Let her go!

130
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:48,000
Saanu...

131
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:49,041
- Saanu...
- Papa!

132
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:51,375
She's unwell. Please let her go.

133
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:54,541
- The Complex needs your daughter.
- Papa!

134
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:58,375
Fertile girls are
worth 10,000 units.

135
00:13:58,458 --> 00:13:59,291
Dad!

136
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,916
Please let her go!

137
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,916
Saanu! Saanu!

138
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,500
Brother...

139
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:13,541
How many units will you
give me in exchange for a girl?

140
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:14,666
Where's the girl?

141
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,083
Look.

142
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:19,625
She was just there.

143
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,041
Everyone, step out.

144
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:44,375
For tomorrow.

145
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:45,791
For tomorrow.

146
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:48,916
Rumi...

147
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:50,833
What are you doing here?

148
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:53,041
I could ask you all the same.

149
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,875
Mariam is so worried about you.

150
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,083
I need to inform her
that we found you.

151
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,416
Everyone at Shambala
is looking for you.

152
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:04,166
<i>Hi, Rumi. Where have you gone?</i>

153
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,416
<i>This isn't the age
for you to risk things.</i>

154
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,583
<i>How could you just leave?</i>

155
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,750
<i>We lost so many of our
people in the Bombay War.</i>

156
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:15,125
<i>Your crazy beliefs have
endangered Shambala.</i>

157
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,291
<i>That crazy belief is the
foundation of Shambala, Veeran.</i>

158
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:22,791
<i>It's the hope for a better tomorrow.</i>

159
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:25,000
<i>Come back, Rumi.</i>

160
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:27,041
<i>The kids miss
listening to your stories.</i>

161
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,750
Tell them those stories are
going to come true, Mariam.

162
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:35,625
The time mentioned in
the Puranas has come!

163
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:40,250
All the stars and planets
suggest the same.

164
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:42,875
And so do my instincts.

165
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,375
The Mother is coming.

166
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,833
Please get the woman.

167
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,375
What's your name?

168
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:12,958
Divya.

169
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:31,791
- What's this?
- Shambala's belief.

170
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:35,333
When darkness engulfs the world,

171
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:37,833
this will show us the way.

172
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,875
When the Mother who carries
God in her womb arrives,

173
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:44,333
this lights up.

174
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:02,458
What happened?

175
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:04,416
It didn't light up.

176
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:07,916
Sorry.

177
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:13,583
Carrying a life inside you
is a blessing in today's time.

178
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:17,875
But there's still time to find
the life we're searching for.

179
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:18,916
<i>It's never going to happen.</i>

180
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:21,916
<i>That compass will never light up.</i>

181
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,125
<i>Nobody will believe your stories.</i>

182
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,541
<i>The truth doesn't seek validation, Veeran.</i>

183
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:30,250
<i>When the time comes,
you'll see for yourself...</i>

184
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:32,500
<i>that all these stories are true.</i>

185
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:34,958
<i>God will return.</i>

186
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:36,791
Raiders!

187
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,166
Let's go!

188
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,625
Hey, careful!

189
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:44,458
Hurry up!

190
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,000
Careful!

191
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:49,625
Luke, faster!

192
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,583
Come!

193
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,958
They're opening the gates of the Complex.

194
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:16,291
Stop.

195
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:25,666
Come back.

196
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:38,750
Commander...

197
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:43,666
these rebels were found
because of my tip.

198
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:45,541
Can I enter the Complex?

199
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:53,375
Wow!

200
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,208
A fertile girl.

201
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:57,833
How did you manage
to escape for so long?

202
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:00,875
Take her to the labs.

203
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:04,291
We will extract your
womb and use it freshly.

204
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:06,208
Let her go.

205
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:07,666
Okay.

206
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,583
Then show me the
way to Shambala.

207
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,416
Here's Shambala.

208
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,125
Oh! Hello, Mariam.

209
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:21,750
You're still just as beautiful.

210
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:27,125
Why did you hide
and send this old man instead?

211
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:30,500
Show me the way to Shambala.

212
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:31,791
And I'll send him back.

213
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:36,333
What are the rebels fighting for anyway?

214
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:47,166
For these dogs?

215
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,916
They'll kill you for this bitten apple.

216
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,833
Are you fighting for them?

217
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:54,375
<i>For change.</i>

218
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:58,375
<i>To end the people
who have turned humans into this.</i>

219
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,416
<i>For tomorrow.</i>

220
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:01,666
Really?

221
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:04,291
If I kill today, there will
be no tomorrow, right?

222
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:05,875
Please.

223
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,583
She has nothing to do with us.

224
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:10,958
Then show me the way to Shambala.

225
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:13,083
Do it and I'll let her go.

226
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:17,875
Don't answer him.

227
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:22,416
They won't spare me
no matter what you say.

228
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,250
This baby won't
see the light of day.

229
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:30,083
And even if it did...

230
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:32,000
this isn't how the world should be.

231
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:35,625
The world needs to change.

232
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:37,958
Don't tell him.

233
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:41,708
Sorry.

234
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:43,541
Wrong answer.

235
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:56,541
Forgive me.

236
00:21:57,958 --> 00:22:00,000
Your belief should come true.

237
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:04,458
You should find the
Mother you're looking for.

238
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,375
Such a waste!

239
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:20,208
When will you guys understand?

240
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:23,125
There are no wars left to fight.

241
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,666
Only the Complex remains in the world.

242
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:30,166
And there's only one God.

243
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:31,666
Supreme Yaskin.

244
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:35,416
You're right.

245
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:37,583
There's only one God.

246
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:40,666
Are you talking to me?

247
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:44,250
Darkness has engulfed from all sides.

248
00:22:45,291 --> 00:22:47,791
It's now time for the light to shine.

249
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:50,416
He is coming!

250
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:51,541
Who?

251
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:53,583
Every religion...

252
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:55,875
and race...

253
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:59,166
is waiting for his arrival.

254
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,958
Ahura Mazda...

255
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,541
Rudra Chakrin...

256
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:04,125
Second Coming...

257
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:07,041
The last avatar in the Dasavataras.

258
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:08,875
He may have a million names.

259
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:11,583
But the entity is one.

260
00:23:12,916 --> 00:23:14,708
He will pierce
through the darkness...

261
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:16,541
and shine light upon...

262
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:19,791
Rumi!

263
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:24,125
Catch them.

264
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:29,250
5000 units for every little rat.

265
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:33,666
<i>Rumi.</i>

266
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:39,708
From now on, you must tell
stories to the kids, Mariam.

267
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:02,958
So, is the tree dead?

268
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:04,000
No, my love.

269
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:05,500
It isn't dead.

270
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,083
It's waiting.

271
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:12,125
It's waiting for the day
that light will shine again.

272
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,541
Ajju, you go! I'll divert them!

273
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,458
Go straight! Don't look back!

274
00:25:06,291 --> 00:25:07,708
Found the baby rat!

275
00:25:08,666 --> 00:25:12,083
You're worth at least
5000 units, right?

276
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:18,000
One-star bounty.

277
00:25:18,333 --> 00:25:19,333
You guessed it right.

278
00:25:19,708 --> 00:25:20,791
5000 units.

279
00:25:21,625 --> 00:25:23,041
You guys can leave now.

280
00:25:23,958 --> 00:25:24,791
What is this?

281
00:25:27,625 --> 00:25:30,500
These are my handcuffs.
And this is my bounty.

282
00:25:30,583 --> 00:25:32,000
This is my gun.

283
00:25:34,541 --> 00:25:36,333
{\an8}Hey! Stop it!

284
00:25:36,541 --> 00:25:37,541
Hey!

285
00:25:40,583 --> 00:25:41,875
How dare you shoot me?!

286
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:45,250
My boss will come
and smash you all now.

287
00:25:47,583 --> 00:25:48,708
Who's your boss?

288
00:25:49,083 --> 00:25:51,458
A kickass soldier in the past wars,

289
00:25:51,666 --> 00:25:53,708
who has never lost
a single fight till now.

290
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,500
The undefeated...

291
00:25:55,708 --> 00:25:57,041
The one and only...

292
00:25:57,375 --> 00:25:58,375
Bhairava!

293
00:26:18,416 --> 00:26:20,166
Ah! He's back!

294
00:26:20,583 --> 00:26:22,166
I wonder what
he'll do this time.

295
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:25,708
Bhairava, wake up!

296
00:26:25,791 --> 00:26:27,500
I hyped you up big time.

297
00:26:27,583 --> 00:26:30,166
Hey, Bujji. Please.
Five minutes.

298
00:26:31,166 --> 00:26:32,250
The Great Bhairava?

299
00:26:33,583 --> 00:26:36,208
We've heard crazy stories
about his fights, boss.

300
00:26:36,583 --> 00:26:38,333
I've heard about him as well.

301
00:26:39,166 --> 00:26:40,458
A good fighter.

302
00:26:41,625 --> 00:26:43,416
But you're not loyal.

303
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,000
You jump ship depending
on who pays more, right?

304
00:26:46,083 --> 00:26:47,333
This is our bounty.

305
00:26:47,458 --> 00:26:49,166
He fell right into my lap.

306
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:50,666
That's 5000 units, Bhairava.

307
00:26:50,958 --> 00:26:54,791
Guys, pay 5000 units and take him.

308
00:26:55,708 --> 00:26:58,125
Defeat us and earn the units.

309
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:11,458
One, two three, four, five, six... nine.

310
00:27:12,583 --> 00:27:14,416
Woah! That's too many guys!

311
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,375
Bujji, return the bounty.

312
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,250
I'm not going to wake up
and fight them for a mere 5000 units.

313
00:27:19,375 --> 00:27:21,125
I was having such a nice dream.

314
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,708
We were inside the Complex.

315
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:31,583
The table was decked
with unlimited food, Bujji.

316
00:27:34,791 --> 00:27:36,000
You were in the Complex?

317
00:27:36,583 --> 00:27:37,500
But how?

318
00:27:38,333 --> 00:27:40,000
Using units like everyone else.

319
00:27:40,708 --> 00:27:43,000
Do you have one million units?

320
00:27:44,875 --> 00:27:45,791
A few units short.

321
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:48,916
Current balance. 250 units.

322
00:27:49,875 --> 00:27:51,416
Bujji, did they ask you?

323
00:27:51,666 --> 00:27:53,125
Did they ask you for the details?

324
00:27:53,208 --> 00:27:54,375
I have a special offer for you.

325
00:27:55,833 --> 00:27:56,958
Stop us.

326
00:27:57,375 --> 00:28:00,208
I'll give you
another 5000 units.

327
00:28:00,875 --> 00:28:04,458
As a bonus, you can
have the old man as well.

328
00:28:04,625 --> 00:28:07,458
Are you tempted now?
The total comes to 10,000 units.

329
00:28:09,458 --> 00:28:11,166
It's too early in the day to fight, Bujji.

330
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:14,041
What? It will be night soon.

331
00:28:17,416 --> 00:28:18,416
Okay.

332
00:28:33,916 --> 00:28:35,666
You should've charged my shoes.

333
00:28:36,166 --> 00:28:37,958
Your shoes.
You should charge them.

334
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,375
How can you be so
irresponsible, Bujji?

335
00:28:41,875 --> 00:28:42,750
Okay, leave it.

336
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:46,666
Okay.

337
00:28:47,375 --> 00:28:48,458
Play a nice song.

338
00:28:50,416 --> 00:28:51,750
Let me get into fight mode.

339
00:28:52,541 --> 00:28:53,375
Okay.

340
00:29:05,041 --> 00:29:05,875
{\an8}Hey...

341
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,500
Bujji...

342
00:29:46,125 --> 00:29:46,958
Bhairava!

343
00:29:49,958 --> 00:29:50,916
Go, get him!

344
00:29:58,958 --> 00:29:59,875
Hey, baldie!

345
00:30:05,458 --> 00:30:06,375
{\an8}Hey, catch!

346
00:30:19,541 --> 00:30:20,666
Hey, you frog!

347
00:30:20,833 --> 00:30:22,458
Enough of this circus!

348
00:30:22,875 --> 00:30:24,375
Come stand in front of me!

349
00:30:33,708 --> 00:30:36,000
Got you! Got you! Got you!

350
00:30:45,625 --> 00:30:46,583
Got scared?

351
00:30:47,375 --> 00:30:48,833
You...

352
00:30:55,125 --> 00:30:56,083
Bujji, are you okay?

353
00:30:57,166 --> 00:30:58,333
Why do you care?

354
00:30:59,416 --> 00:31:01,375
- Does it hurt?
- This man hit me.

355
00:31:01,458 --> 00:31:04,125
And you're jumping
around like a frog.

356
00:31:04,375 --> 00:31:07,000
If you really care about me, go whack him.

357
00:31:30,375 --> 00:31:32,125
Bhairava, we lost our bounty.

358
00:31:34,791 --> 00:31:36,333
That bounty is mine.

359
00:31:42,583 --> 00:31:43,458
Catch him!

360
00:32:05,875 --> 00:32:06,833
There's a staircase, brother.

361
00:32:35,958 --> 00:32:36,875
Hey, hey...

362
00:32:49,208 --> 00:32:50,416
What are you looking at, baldie?

363
00:33:04,875 --> 00:33:08,000
<i>Oh, the whole world is cheating</i>

364
00:33:08,083 --> 00:33:11,208
<i>Why are their eyes fixed on us?</i>

365
00:33:11,291 --> 00:33:14,166
<i>Oh, the whole world is cheating</i>

366
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:17,708
<i>Why are their eyes fixed on us?</i>

367
00:33:17,791 --> 00:33:19,958
<i>O my playful eyes</i>

368
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:23,500
<i>They don't get convinced easily
And they are stubborn</i>

369
00:33:23,583 --> 00:33:26,125
<i>See the power of a Jatt boy</i>

370
00:33:26,583 --> 00:33:29,708
<i>He never steps back, my love</i>

371
00:33:29,791 --> 00:33:32,333
<i>He makes progress day and night</i>

372
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:35,500
<i>He makes progress day and night</i>

373
00:33:44,041 --> 00:33:44,916
Move!

374
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,416
Thanks, boss. You're my hero.

375
00:33:48,208 --> 00:33:49,041
Thanks.

376
00:33:50,166 --> 00:33:51,000
Boss!

377
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,916
Welcome back.

378
00:34:05,166 --> 00:34:07,250
<i>O my playful eyes</i>

379
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:11,000
<i>They don't get convinced easily
And they are stubborn</i>

380
00:34:11,083 --> 00:34:13,708
<i>See the power of a Jatt boy</i>

381
00:34:14,041 --> 00:34:17,041
<i>He never steps back, my love</i>

382
00:34:17,125 --> 00:34:19,666
<i>He makes progress day and night</i>

383
00:34:20,166 --> 00:34:23,291
<i>He makes progress day and night</i>

384
00:34:23,375 --> 00:34:26,250
<i>See the power of a Jatt boy</i>

385
00:34:26,333 --> 00:34:29,916
<i>He never steps back, my love</i>

386
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,500
<i>How many more to go?</i>

387
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:34,208
<i>I can't fight anymore.</i>

388
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,250
<i>My Complex...</i>

389
00:34:59,291 --> 00:35:01,583
Hey! Let go! I said, let go!

390
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,625
I want to whistle.
Please take off one handcuff.

391
00:35:19,708 --> 00:35:20,875
- Please, Bujji.
- Okay.

392
00:35:23,041 --> 00:35:24,458
- Thanks, Bujji.
- You're welcome.

393
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:28,625
Bujji, you see this?

394
00:35:29,875 --> 00:35:31,083
I have fans as well.

395
00:35:31,708 --> 00:35:33,666
Yeah, I know. Rebel fans.

396
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,125
<i>O my playful eyes</i>

397
00:35:38,708 --> 00:35:41,708
<i>See the power of a Jatt boy</i>

398
00:35:41,791 --> 00:35:45,083
<i>-He never steps back, my love</i>
-Thanks, boss. I'll get going.

399
00:35:49,708 --> 00:35:51,541
Hey, kiddo. My units.

400
00:36:07,125 --> 00:36:08,208
This is mine.

401
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:09,750
This is mine.

402
00:36:10,791 --> 00:36:12,291
You won't get any units for this.

403
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:14,791
This is Kala Bhairava!

404
00:36:16,125 --> 00:36:19,708
People believed he was the protector
of Kashi once upon a time.

405
00:36:20,208 --> 00:36:23,125
You should protect Kashi now, Bhairava.

406
00:36:24,291 --> 00:36:25,166
Yeah.

407
00:36:25,375 --> 00:36:26,250
I got this.

408
00:36:26,458 --> 00:36:29,125
- Hey!
- Protector, my foot!

409
00:36:29,208 --> 00:36:31,750
Kashi will be fine only if he leaves.

410
00:36:31,833 --> 00:36:33,833
- He collapsed my home.
- He was just complimenting me.

411
00:37:10,083 --> 00:37:11,291
What are you doing here?

412
00:37:11,791 --> 00:37:14,125
Give me some fresh news.

413
00:37:14,416 --> 00:37:15,333
I'm bored to death.

414
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,958
What are you looking at?

415
00:38:01,166 --> 00:38:02,875
A life within a life.

416
00:38:04,666 --> 00:38:06,208
It's so strange, don't you think?

417
00:38:06,791 --> 00:38:08,291
But it won't survive.

418
00:38:09,208 --> 00:38:13,833
Sometimes I wish I was negative.

419
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:16,333
I could get out of this cage at least.

420
00:38:20,791 --> 00:38:22,166
You won't get it.

421
00:38:34,041 --> 00:38:36,458
You're sad that you're
not positive, right?

422
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:39,791
There's good food, sound sleep.

423
00:38:40,625 --> 00:38:42,250
You never had the fortune.

424
00:38:44,708 --> 00:38:45,583
Poor girl!

425
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:00,541
Everyone feels hungry.

426
00:39:04,125 --> 00:39:05,708
If you can't be positive...

427
00:39:07,041 --> 00:39:08,208
you got to be smart at least.

428
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,833
Commander Manas.

429
00:39:23,375 --> 00:39:24,791
We were not expecting you.

430
00:39:26,083 --> 00:39:27,166
I'll get going then.

431
00:39:27,625 --> 00:39:30,875
- Call me when you're expecting me.
- I'm sorry, sir.

432
00:39:35,833 --> 00:39:37,833
When will you fulfill Supreme's wish?

433
00:39:39,583 --> 00:39:42,250
What's the status of Project K?

434
00:39:42,583 --> 00:39:43,583
91 days.

435
00:39:44,083 --> 00:39:44,916
Really?

436
00:39:45,333 --> 00:39:47,875
How many days did Supreme ask for?

437
00:39:48,166 --> 00:39:49,333
150 days, sir.

438
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:52,875
Have some shame!

439
00:39:53,875 --> 00:39:54,833
You have such a huge lab here.

440
00:39:54,916 --> 00:39:55,958
Thousands of girls at your disposal.

441
00:39:57,083 --> 00:39:57,958
And these...

442
00:39:58,875 --> 00:40:00,333
matching uniforms.

443
00:40:01,166 --> 00:40:02,041
It's such a waste!

444
00:40:02,583 --> 00:40:04,958
Can I... Can I show you something, sir?

445
00:40:05,458 --> 00:40:06,333
Please come.

446
00:40:07,375 --> 00:40:11,708
We're summoning all the fertile women
to the labs like you asked.

447
00:40:11,916 --> 00:40:12,958
Including little girls.

448
00:40:15,125 --> 00:40:18,916
The formula that Supreme has asked for,
is far beyond human DNA.

449
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:22,250
This formula is so powerful that...

450
00:40:22,333 --> 00:40:24,208
it puts these girls' lives at risk.

451
00:40:24,625 --> 00:40:25,791
Mother!

452
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,458
They can't carry this formula.

453
00:40:29,541 --> 00:40:32,041
Not every girl has the
strength to grow the seed.

454
00:40:32,583 --> 00:40:33,916
They turn out to be negative.

455
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,875
Infertile.

456
00:40:35,208 --> 00:40:37,250
Whichever girl we plant
the seed in is positive.

457
00:40:37,333 --> 00:40:38,875
But not beyond three months.

458
00:40:38,958 --> 00:40:40,333
Supreme wants the serum.

459
00:40:40,583 --> 00:40:41,958
Not your explanations.

460
00:40:44,333 --> 00:40:47,291
Supreme will take my case
today because of you guys.

461
00:40:49,416 --> 00:40:52,708
I'm sure 98 is better than 91.

462
00:40:53,458 --> 00:40:54,583
Extract her.

463
00:40:55,375 --> 00:40:57,291
We should wait a few more days.

464
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:59,625
Her vitals are not stable.

465
00:40:59,708 --> 00:41:01,166
Supreme ordered to see me today.

466
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,333
Not in a few more days.

467
00:41:02,958 --> 00:41:04,458
Extract her now. It's an order.

468
00:41:07,916 --> 00:41:08,750
Sorry.

469
00:41:09,583 --> 00:41:11,750
You won't get to hit a century this time.

470
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,416
Better luck next time.

471
00:42:39,708 --> 00:42:40,625
Is she dead?

472
00:42:40,875 --> 00:42:42,791
We've been trying for years now.

473
00:42:42,958 --> 00:42:45,291
This experiment can never be successful.

474
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:47,166
There's only one way to do this.

475
00:42:48,458 --> 00:42:50,916
If we know exactly what Supreme wants,

476
00:42:51,458 --> 00:42:53,791
we will know how to proceed further.

477
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:56,833
What is Project K?

478
00:42:57,958 --> 00:42:59,458
If you don't know already,

479
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:00,916
it means that...

480
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,333
you're not meant to know.

481
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:06,333
Do you know?

482
00:43:07,875 --> 00:43:10,458
I can sacrifice my life for Supreme.

483
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:13,000
But I cannot do this blindly anymore.

484
00:43:13,375 --> 00:43:14,833
I need his help.

485
00:43:14,958 --> 00:43:17,625
Take me to him.
I'll ask him personally.

486
00:43:18,083 --> 00:43:18,916
Alright.

487
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:40,083
Counselor Bani.

488
00:43:40,833 --> 00:43:42,375
What a beautiful day, right?

489
00:43:44,416 --> 00:43:45,333
Why is he here?

490
00:43:45,833 --> 00:43:46,958
He's a scientist at the lab.

491
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:51,000
He has some important
doubts about Project K.

492
00:43:51,375 --> 00:43:52,250
Follow me.

493
00:44:11,791 --> 00:44:13,083
Hand me the serum.

494
00:44:30,166 --> 00:44:32,958
I'm meeting him for the
first time in so many years.

495
00:44:34,416 --> 00:44:36,416
Make sure it's not your last time.

496
00:45:21,291 --> 00:45:24,750
Manas from Project K is here.

497
00:45:42,416 --> 00:45:46,750
Supreme, this is the best serum
from the labs so far.

498
00:45:47,291 --> 00:45:49,708
I got it extracted personally.

499
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:56,791
No one is living
beyond 100 days.

500
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:59,375
What's in this serum?

501
00:46:29,833 --> 00:46:30,708
What happened?

502
00:46:50,666 --> 00:46:52,166
It's been so long...

503
00:46:53,625 --> 00:46:56,083
since someone tried to kill me.

504
00:47:27,416 --> 00:47:30,041
I've offered many lives to death.

505
00:47:32,125 --> 00:47:33,750
Death won't come near me.

506
00:47:34,791 --> 00:47:38,083
I feel pity for you.

507
00:47:39,875 --> 00:47:41,791
Why did you want to kill me?

508
00:47:42,291 --> 00:47:44,208
For the greater good.

509
00:47:44,291 --> 00:47:45,291
The greater good?

510
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:50,458
Do you know how many lives the
greater good has taken in history?

511
00:47:52,541 --> 00:47:56,458
The greater good changes every
time Kings and Kingships change.

512
00:47:57,583 --> 00:47:59,250
Don't be deluded by it.

513
00:48:00,708 --> 00:48:02,500
What do you seek anyway?

514
00:48:02,833 --> 00:48:06,458
I want to save this world.

515
00:48:08,291 --> 00:48:10,500
I want to save this world.

516
00:48:14,166 --> 00:48:15,958
Isn't that what I'm doing?

517
00:48:16,333 --> 00:48:20,125
All those people waging wars
in the name of God and money...

518
00:48:20,250 --> 00:48:22,500
I united them with just one war.

519
00:48:23,125 --> 00:48:23,958
What?

520
00:48:24,458 --> 00:48:25,333
Is that wrong?

521
00:48:27,833 --> 00:48:30,333
Those who are responsible
for destroying nature...

522
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:32,833
have been kept away from it.

523
00:48:34,083 --> 00:48:34,916
Is that wrong?

524
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,625
You can't do whatever you feel like.

525
00:48:38,041 --> 00:48:38,916
Who the hell are you?

526
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,250
Who the hell are you guys to destroy it?

527
00:48:45,041 --> 00:48:48,125
Despite the endless opportunities
spanning over generations,

528
00:48:48,208 --> 00:48:50,500
man fails to redeem himself
and he never will.

529
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:55,666
It's not your fault.

530
00:48:58,625 --> 00:49:02,791
Human beings were defected to begin with.

531
00:49:27,541 --> 00:49:28,708
You wanted to know...

532
00:49:29,708 --> 00:49:31,416
what this serum consists of, right?

533
00:49:33,708 --> 00:49:35,666
It has the solution to your defect.

534
00:49:37,916 --> 00:49:39,375
The solution to everything.

535
00:49:42,166 --> 00:49:43,041
Don't worry.

536
00:49:44,625 --> 00:49:46,416
A new yuga will rise.

537
00:49:56,166 --> 00:49:59,500
Find a woman who can carry the
formula in her womb for 150 days.

538
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:45,875
How far along are you?

539
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:50,833
- Five.
- Five!

540
00:50:53,125 --> 00:50:53,958
That is...

541
00:50:54,291 --> 00:50:55,583
150 days!

542
00:50:58,750 --> 00:50:59,875
How is this possible?

543
00:51:00,708 --> 00:51:04,208
No one was able to
carry the seed beyond three months.

544
00:51:04,916 --> 00:51:07,541
You've always tested negative, right?

545
00:51:08,125 --> 00:51:12,166
As always, I tested negative
in the last seeding.

546
00:51:12,625 --> 00:51:13,500
How is this possible then?

547
00:51:14,166 --> 00:51:15,000
I have no clue.

548
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:18,208
But one day, there was movement.

549
00:51:18,791 --> 00:51:20,166
What if the Complex finds out?

550
00:51:22,416 --> 00:51:23,500
They will kill it.

551
00:51:24,208 --> 00:51:26,166
If they find out from another source,
they will kill you as well.

552
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:27,083
- Let's go.
- No! Please!

553
00:51:30,625 --> 00:51:32,875
You've crossed 150 days.

554
00:51:33,375 --> 00:51:35,500
You'll be treated like a
Queen at the Complex.

555
00:51:35,583 --> 00:51:37,291
If you don't tell them, I will.

556
00:51:37,916 --> 00:51:39,708
I don't even remember
my mom's face.

557
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,708
My dad sold me to the Complex
when I was a kid.

558
00:51:47,666 --> 00:51:49,541
I don't have anything in this world.

559
00:51:53,375 --> 00:51:54,208
But now I have this.

560
00:51:55,041 --> 00:51:57,791
That thing growing in your
womb is an experiment.

561
00:51:57,958 --> 00:51:58,916
It's not a baby.

562
00:51:59,791 --> 00:52:01,833
There's no need to get sentimental.

563
00:52:02,833 --> 00:52:05,041
It's born to a lab experiment.

564
00:52:05,125 --> 00:52:06,333
Not a father.

565
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:10,208
But it has a mother.

566
00:52:11,541 --> 00:52:12,583
So, what's the plan?

567
00:52:13,666 --> 00:52:15,208
How many days can you hide it?

568
00:52:17,166 --> 00:52:19,416
You will be exposed soon.

569
00:52:21,125 --> 00:52:22,083
No, please.

570
00:52:24,875 --> 00:52:26,000
I want to keep this.

571
00:52:31,125 --> 00:52:32,791
What an epic fight, Bhairava!

572
00:52:32,875 --> 00:52:34,833
I've heard so many stories about you.

573
00:52:34,916 --> 00:52:37,833
Is it true that you haven't
lost a single fight to date?

574
00:52:38,291 --> 00:52:40,625
Bujji, I like this one.

575
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:44,375
Bhairava, please let me go.

576
00:52:44,583 --> 00:52:46,541
I don't like him, Bhairava.

577
00:52:46,875 --> 00:52:48,083
Don't sell me, boss.

578
00:52:48,416 --> 00:52:49,291
You're my hero.

579
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:51,250
Better kill me.

580
00:52:52,333 --> 00:52:54,958
Sorry, boss. I have nothing
to gain from killing you.

581
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:56,666
You just called me a hero.

582
00:52:57,333 --> 00:52:59,416
I'll get you a scrumptious last meal.

583
00:52:59,958 --> 00:53:01,416
Such a waste of units.

584
00:53:04,041 --> 00:53:04,875
Chintu!

585
00:53:05,375 --> 00:53:06,625
My best friend.

586
00:53:07,166 --> 00:53:09,166
He sells the best food in Kashi.

587
00:53:10,625 --> 00:53:12,833
Hey, Chints, what's today's special?

588
00:53:14,333 --> 00:53:16,166
- Your death.
- Got it!

589
00:53:16,750 --> 00:53:18,625
You're here for your units?
They are safe with me.

590
00:53:22,041 --> 00:53:25,166
I'll return your money as
soon as I go to the Complex.

591
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:26,125
You know it!

592
00:53:26,333 --> 00:53:27,708
I swear on you!

593
00:53:28,208 --> 00:53:33,333
I'm 101 percent sure that
you lie 99 percent of the time.

594
00:53:34,833 --> 00:53:37,708
This is what you tell everyone in Kashi.
Give me a break.

595
00:53:41,791 --> 00:53:42,625
What's that?

596
00:53:43,833 --> 00:53:47,041
It's fresh out of the Complex.

597
00:53:47,125 --> 00:53:47,958
I want it.

598
00:53:48,416 --> 00:53:50,166
Don't think so highly
of yourself, mate.

599
00:53:50,541 --> 00:53:52,291
It's worth 5000 units.

600
00:53:52,875 --> 00:53:54,291
Take this inside, Jhansi Rani.

601
00:53:54,416 --> 00:53:56,083
Here. 5000 units.

602
00:54:08,875 --> 00:54:11,458
Wow! Is this egg going to get us
inside the Complex?

603
00:54:11,875 --> 00:54:13,583
It's a real egg, Bujji.

604
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:16,791
Ditch your dreams of going to the Complex.

605
00:54:16,875 --> 00:54:20,333
We can earn only an egg
with these petty bounties.

606
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:22,958
If we want to go to the Complex...

607
00:54:23,791 --> 00:54:25,666
we need to hit a jackpot, Bujji.

608
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,041
Boss, can I take a look?

609
00:54:30,375 --> 00:54:31,208
No, you cannot.

610
00:54:32,541 --> 00:54:36,958
We need to preserve this
in a high-security zone, Bujji.

611
00:54:37,708 --> 00:54:40,083
By the way, is Bujji a nickname?

612
00:54:40,166 --> 00:54:42,291
Bionic User Josen Intelligence.

613
00:54:42,541 --> 00:54:45,416
I used to pilot the Complex
ships once upon a time.

614
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:46,583
Look at me now.

615
00:54:46,666 --> 00:54:48,958
I pulled you out of the junkyard
and gave you a body.

616
00:54:49,125 --> 00:54:50,750
Show some gratitude.

617
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:52,208
A little.

618
00:54:52,583 --> 00:54:55,125
That is why my body
still resembles a junkyard.

619
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:57,833
Bhairava, why don't
you join forces with us?

620
00:54:59,375 --> 00:55:00,458
Will you pay me more units?

621
00:55:00,541 --> 00:55:02,750
Come on!
Everything isn't about the units.

622
00:55:03,291 --> 00:55:04,250
Do it for the greater good.

623
00:55:04,333 --> 00:55:06,166
Fight on the rebels' side
for a better tomorrow.

624
00:55:06,458 --> 00:55:09,083
I've fought on all sides, boss.

625
00:55:10,458 --> 00:55:12,083
No matter who wins...

626
00:55:14,166 --> 00:55:16,291
this is how people like us end up.

627
00:55:16,416 --> 00:55:17,833
I finally realized something.

628
00:55:18,291 --> 00:55:20,500
There's only one side
to be on in the world.

629
00:55:23,583 --> 00:55:24,500
Your own side.

630
00:55:25,375 --> 00:55:26,708
Selfish side.

631
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,958
<i>War took both my parents' lives.</i>

632
00:55:43,625 --> 00:55:45,500
<i>A captain saved me.</i>

633
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:47,958
<i>Apparently, I didn't cry at all.</i>

634
00:55:48,416 --> 00:55:50,166
<i>As if I was acquainted with war.</i>

635
00:56:09,375 --> 00:56:11,083
<i>He taught me everything.</i>

636
00:56:13,333 --> 00:56:14,833
<i>How to survive in this world.</i>

637
00:56:15,583 --> 00:56:16,416
<i>How to fight.</i>

638
00:56:17,333 --> 00:56:18,916
<i>And how to attain victory.</i>

639
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:24,250
<i>The Complex placed a bounty
on the captain for what he did.</i>

640
00:56:37,541 --> 00:56:40,041
You lost everything.
What's left to give?

641
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:51,208
Will you send him with me?

642
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:04,291
<i>He wanted to sell me
and go to the Complex.</i>

643
00:57:07,916 --> 00:57:08,750
Bhairava!

644
00:57:10,291 --> 00:57:11,125
Sorry.

645
00:57:13,250 --> 00:57:16,125
<i>But he forgot that he was the one
who taught me everything.</i>

646
00:57:20,208 --> 00:57:21,125
I'm sorry, Captain.

647
00:57:25,416 --> 00:57:28,875
<i>Before he could sell me,
I sold him out.</i>

648
00:57:34,541 --> 00:57:35,416
You're right.

649
00:57:37,208 --> 00:57:38,500
This is how you're
supposed to live in this world.

650
00:57:39,375 --> 00:57:40,208
Don't change.

651
00:57:52,958 --> 00:57:53,791
Sorry, boss.

652
00:57:54,583 --> 00:57:56,833
I didn't know you had such
a sentimental flashback.

653
00:57:57,125 --> 00:57:59,541
Ask him again next week.
He'll narrate a different flashback.

654
00:58:01,958 --> 00:58:03,583
Forced entry at home location.

655
00:58:03,666 --> 00:58:05,416
Door broken. Three men armed.

656
00:58:06,333 --> 00:58:08,291
- Come.
- Please let me go, boss.

657
00:58:08,750 --> 00:58:10,541
- Move it!
- Boss, please let me go!

658
00:58:20,291 --> 00:58:21,958
Did you find anything valuable?

659
00:58:22,041 --> 00:58:25,583
There's nothing here.
He sold everything ages ago.

660
00:58:25,666 --> 00:58:27,291
If someone were interested...

661
00:58:27,416 --> 00:58:30,250
he would've sold me as well.

662
00:58:32,166 --> 00:58:34,041
Who would buy you, man?

663
00:58:34,125 --> 00:58:36,833
How much will your oxygen mask sell for?

664
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,791
Nothing. Not a single unit.

665
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,541
The cylinder has been
empty for a while now.

666
00:58:42,625 --> 00:58:44,625
He uses it by force of habit.

667
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:48,875
Of course, it's empty.
You used it all up.

668
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:50,958
When I rented you this place...

669
00:58:52,041 --> 00:58:53,000
Rent.

670
00:58:53,833 --> 00:58:54,875
Wow!

671
00:58:55,166 --> 00:58:56,666
What a sweet word!

672
00:58:56,833 --> 00:58:58,708
Did you ever pay rent?

673
00:58:58,791 --> 00:59:01,416
Ronnie, did you come all
the way for just 10,000 units?

674
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:03,291
Hold on. I just got
done with a fight.

675
00:59:04,125 --> 00:59:07,250
As soon as I get the money,
you'll be the first one I'll pay.

676
00:59:07,666 --> 00:59:09,708
What about me?

677
00:59:09,791 --> 00:59:10,625
Hey, Leon.

678
00:59:11,583 --> 00:59:12,583
Where did you come from?

679
00:59:12,875 --> 00:59:16,166
I want my 20,000 units right now.

680
00:59:16,541 --> 00:59:19,125
Otherwise, I'll take your car.

681
00:59:19,708 --> 00:59:21,416
Please do that.

682
00:59:21,708 --> 00:59:23,208
I'll kill you, old man!

683
00:59:23,291 --> 00:59:24,750
What will you do with
this piece of junk, sir?

684
00:59:24,833 --> 00:59:27,291
You'll get your units back.

685
00:59:28,125 --> 00:59:29,041
Trust me.

686
00:59:30,791 --> 00:59:31,875
I promise.

687
00:59:31,958 --> 00:59:34,333
Aren't you tired of making
false promises, Bhairava?

688
00:59:37,958 --> 00:59:39,625
Hey, Roxie!

689
00:59:42,833 --> 00:59:44,416
He'll return my units first.

690
00:59:45,083 --> 00:59:49,875
After that, I don't care if you
whack him or kill him even.

691
00:59:50,208 --> 00:59:51,375
Roxie...

692
00:59:52,333 --> 00:59:54,125
How many units do you want?

693
00:59:54,666 --> 00:59:55,500
Tell me.

694
00:59:56,125 --> 00:59:58,291
I'll take really good care of you.

695
01:00:02,791 --> 01:00:05,458
Anyone else who wants to take care of me?

696
01:00:06,791 --> 01:00:08,416
Bhairava, I got to go, okay? Take care.

697
01:00:09,208 --> 01:00:10,916
Wait up, sir.
Collect your units.

698
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,083
I'll see you later.

699
01:00:16,083 --> 01:00:17,291
Nice. Correct.

700
01:00:17,625 --> 01:00:18,541
He deserves it.

701
01:00:20,708 --> 01:00:21,875
I hope you're not hurt.

702
01:00:25,833 --> 01:00:26,791
Hey, Roxie...

703
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:32,625
Roxie, I really missed you a lot.

704
01:00:34,041 --> 01:00:35,791
I thought you wanted me.

705
01:00:36,041 --> 01:00:37,708
But you're only after my units.

706
01:00:40,166 --> 01:00:42,833
I will never have
to see your face again.

707
01:00:42,916 --> 01:00:44,625
I got a job at the Complex.

708
01:00:57,875 --> 01:01:00,625
Roxie, Roxie, Roxie... please.

709
01:01:00,958 --> 01:01:02,500
God, take my eyesight away!

710
01:01:02,666 --> 01:01:03,791
Everyday...

711
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:06,000
I keep thinking about you.

712
01:01:06,791 --> 01:01:10,250
Then tell me where
we met the first time.

713
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:11,583
He's screwed!

714
01:01:12,916 --> 01:01:15,541
Well, the sand, gate...

715
01:01:15,625 --> 01:01:16,708
You forgot, didn't you?

716
01:01:16,791 --> 01:01:19,416
How could I forget, Roxie?

717
01:01:19,916 --> 01:01:21,083
It's very important.

718
01:01:21,708 --> 01:01:23,208
No way I'd forget, Roxie.

719
01:01:23,416 --> 01:01:25,916
- Bujji...
- Don't involve me, boss.

720
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:31,958
Roxie, Roxie, Roxie...

721
01:01:32,333 --> 01:01:34,208
Are you really going
to the Complex, Roxie?

722
01:01:34,291 --> 01:01:35,125
Yes.

723
01:01:36,666 --> 01:01:38,250
Please take me along.

724
01:01:38,791 --> 01:01:39,625
Why?

725
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:42,666
Because I like you, Roxie.

726
01:01:42,833 --> 01:01:43,791
That's a lie!

727
01:01:43,875 --> 01:01:46,000
You only like yourself, Bhairava.

728
01:01:46,291 --> 01:01:48,083
You're the most selfish guy in the world.

729
01:01:48,583 --> 01:01:49,666
Correct. Correct. Correct.

730
01:01:49,750 --> 01:01:51,791
Still, take me along for a day.

731
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:53,583
Even a minute or a second would do.

732
01:01:54,041 --> 01:01:55,916
I'll do anything to go to the Complex.

733
01:01:56,958 --> 01:01:57,791
Okay, fine.

734
01:01:58,416 --> 01:02:01,750
Tell me you love me like you mean it.

735
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:09,458
I love you.

736
01:02:17,875 --> 01:02:18,708
I love you.

737
01:02:24,166 --> 01:02:25,583
That's the best you can do.

738
01:02:30,458 --> 01:02:33,291
Hey, 9:00 a.m. East Gate.
See you tomorrow.

739
01:02:34,583 --> 01:02:37,125
Yeah!

740
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:38,875
Yeah!

741
01:02:47,333 --> 01:02:50,375
Supreme has sent orders to try again.

742
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:53,166
We're giving you another chance.

743
01:02:53,916 --> 01:02:56,333
Even if one of you
turns out to be positive,

744
01:02:56,916 --> 01:02:58,375
it means we're successful.

745
01:02:58,958 --> 01:03:01,125
All of you will go through
seeding tomorrow.

746
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:04,333
If Supreme's mercy is upon you,

747
01:03:04,750 --> 01:03:07,291
you all could be positive as well.

748
01:03:30,958 --> 01:03:31,916
We need to go over there.

749
01:03:33,416 --> 01:03:34,250
What about over there?

750
01:03:40,833 --> 01:03:43,250
<i>Roxie. Work permit for 70 days.</i>

751
01:03:43,333 --> 01:03:45,375
I've registered him as a temporary worker.

752
01:03:46,375 --> 01:03:49,375
<i>Bhairava. Work permit for 60 minutes.</i>

753
01:03:50,291 --> 01:03:51,541
What? Only an hour?

754
01:03:51,833 --> 01:03:53,166
That's more than enough.

755
01:03:59,666 --> 01:04:01,625
<i>Three, two, one...</i>

756
01:04:02,125 --> 01:04:03,166
<i>and lift-off.</i>

757
01:04:05,625 --> 01:04:07,458
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

758
01:04:32,625 --> 01:04:34,166
Come. This is our floor.

759
01:04:42,666 --> 01:04:45,000
This generator room is
like the sun of the Complex.

760
01:04:46,041 --> 01:04:48,250
This is where all the energy is generated.

761
01:04:48,666 --> 01:04:51,333
It sucks all the energy from Earth.

762
01:05:02,291 --> 01:05:03,458
Bhairava, come here.

763
01:05:04,958 --> 01:05:05,916
Let's get to work.

764
01:05:11,166 --> 01:05:12,708
I can't waste my one hour here.

765
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,250
I didn't come to the
Complex for this. Let's go.

766
01:05:14,333 --> 01:05:15,541
- Come on, come with me.
- No, no, no!

767
01:05:18,833 --> 01:05:20,500
Trying to help you was a mistake.

768
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:21,666
You're so selfish!

769
01:05:23,958 --> 01:05:25,208
I'm going to lose my job.

770
01:05:26,875 --> 01:05:27,875
Hey! Hello!

771
01:05:28,250 --> 01:05:29,083
What are you looking at?

772
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:30,375
Hello!

773
01:05:38,583 --> 01:05:39,416
Let's go, Bhairava!

774
01:05:40,708 --> 01:05:41,583
Come.

775
01:05:54,625 --> 01:05:58,041
<i>Where have the destinies brought us</i>

776
01:05:58,250 --> 01:06:02,083
<i>It's a new journey, my friend</i>

777
01:06:16,208 --> 01:06:21,333
<i>Looking at these sights
It feels like the stars have bloomed</i>

778
01:06:22,083 --> 01:06:26,416
<i>Who made all these seasons
These lights and colors</i>

779
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:28,416
<i>Descend on the Earth</i>

780
01:06:28,833 --> 01:06:35,666
<i>Eyes have frozen
The heavens are in front of me</i>

781
01:06:40,333 --> 01:06:45,375
<i>This place...
This land, these paths are all mine</i>

782
01:06:46,125 --> 01:06:50,333
<i>One day these incomplete
Desires will be fulfilled</i>

783
01:06:50,416 --> 01:06:52,500
<i>These are the signs of time</i>

784
01:06:52,916 --> 01:06:56,375
<i>I want to achieve this in every moment</i>

785
01:06:56,458 --> 01:06:59,583
<i>This is my passion</i>

786
01:07:15,375 --> 01:07:19,291
<i>My dream has come true
There is magic happening</i>

787
01:08:04,375 --> 01:08:07,416
<i>This is my abode from now</i>

788
01:08:08,166 --> 01:08:11,083
<i>I want to spend every moment here</i>

789
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:14,208
<i>This heart dances joyfully always</i>

790
01:08:14,416 --> 01:08:17,583
<i>Now life smiles
There is no sorrow</i>

791
01:08:17,666 --> 01:08:21,458
<i>It's a flag of happiness flying high</i>

792
01:09:57,250 --> 01:09:58,125
Counselor Bani,

793
01:09:58,375 --> 01:10:00,041
we've found something unusual.

794
01:10:00,541 --> 01:10:02,750
We know nothing about this material.

795
01:10:09,541 --> 01:10:11,083
There's something unusual happening.

796
01:10:40,333 --> 01:10:41,166
What is this?

797
01:10:45,791 --> 01:10:46,625
Please.

798
01:10:49,666 --> 01:10:50,500
Help.

799
01:10:57,458 --> 01:10:59,125
Give it to me. It's okay.

800
01:11:05,416 --> 01:11:06,250
Sorry.

801
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:18,500
This is a miracle.

802
01:13:18,708 --> 01:13:21,875
Finally, we found a woman who
could carry the formula for 150 days.

803
01:13:22,208 --> 01:13:25,500
The baby in her womb is growing
more rapidly than a regular one.

804
01:13:26,166 --> 01:13:29,958
At this rate, she'll
deliver the baby soon.

805
01:13:30,583 --> 01:13:32,500
Supreme has zero
interest in growing babies.

806
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,708
Prep her for extraction.

807
01:14:17,833 --> 01:14:19,208
Did he shoot you?

808
01:14:21,791 --> 01:14:23,541
You should have died.

809
01:14:23,750 --> 01:14:26,791
Death is certain for the one who is born.

810
01:14:27,041 --> 01:14:29,041
I can't understand your Hindi.

811
01:14:29,875 --> 01:14:31,208
I guess it's the generation gap.

812
01:14:31,958 --> 01:14:34,333
- What's your name?
- Go away!

813
01:14:34,416 --> 01:14:35,541
My name is Raia.

814
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,708
You fought incredibly well!

815
01:14:39,958 --> 01:14:43,750
Rebels will easily win the war
with a soldier like you.

816
01:14:43,833 --> 01:14:45,666
In war...

817
01:14:46,875 --> 01:14:48,333
only death wins.

818
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:52,125
This isn't my war.

819
01:14:52,416 --> 01:14:54,958
Hello! Do you know what
the situation is like out there?

820
01:14:55,250 --> 01:14:56,625
How long have you been out here?

821
01:14:57,250 --> 01:14:59,791
Do you have any idea how
many people you could save?

822
01:15:00,166 --> 01:15:01,500
My purpose is to save...

823
01:15:02,958 --> 01:15:04,583
only one person.

824
01:15:06,791 --> 01:15:08,166
Only one!

825
01:15:42,875 --> 01:15:45,125
Supreme wanted a 120-day-old serum.

826
01:15:46,666 --> 01:15:48,916
But what you have is even better.

827
01:15:49,416 --> 01:15:52,666
I'll personally take
this serum to Supreme.

828
01:16:02,250 --> 01:16:03,666
Please open this!

829
01:16:05,166 --> 01:16:06,291
Please don't do this!

830
01:16:06,625 --> 01:16:07,458
Oh, no!

831
01:16:13,583 --> 01:16:14,916
Please, let me go!

832
01:16:16,750 --> 01:16:17,625
Please!

833
01:17:39,291 --> 01:17:40,125
Where did she go?

834
01:17:40,708 --> 01:17:41,541
No!

835
01:18:06,791 --> 01:18:07,666
That was close.

836
01:18:08,083 --> 01:18:09,958
Sorry, there was no
other way to get you out.

837
01:18:13,208 --> 01:18:15,250
I thought it was all over.

838
01:18:15,875 --> 01:18:17,125
I was terrified that my baby would die.

839
01:18:17,375 --> 01:18:19,708
You ignored the fact
that you could've died.

840
01:18:19,791 --> 01:18:21,625
That's why you are special, SUM 80.

841
01:18:21,875 --> 01:18:23,000
Come on. We don't have time.

842
01:18:23,250 --> 01:18:25,416
I messaged my people.
They must be waiting.

843
01:18:26,833 --> 01:18:27,833
Your people?

844
01:18:28,541 --> 01:18:29,375
Who are you?

845
01:18:32,125 --> 01:18:32,958
I'm a rebel.

846
01:18:33,875 --> 01:18:34,791
From Shambala.

847
01:18:35,291 --> 01:18:36,833
I was a spy at the lab for two years.

848
01:18:38,833 --> 01:18:42,291
I watched many horrific
incidents and still did nothing.

849
01:18:42,541 --> 01:18:45,000
I convinced myself that
I was on a different mission.

850
01:18:47,458 --> 01:18:48,333
But...

851
01:18:49,041 --> 01:18:50,458
after seeing you, I realized that

852
01:18:50,541 --> 01:18:54,041
there can't be a bigger
mission than saving you.

853
01:18:56,875 --> 01:18:57,750
Let's go.

854
01:18:59,375 --> 01:19:01,416
That was embarrassing.

855
01:19:02,291 --> 01:19:04,875
Don't worry, Bhairava. You didn't
have much respect to begin with.

856
01:19:06,250 --> 01:19:07,916
You don't have a heart, Bujji.

857
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:10,958
Brother, give my drink back.

858
01:19:12,416 --> 01:19:13,500
What kind of a drink is this?

859
01:19:14,041 --> 01:19:15,166
The Complex has amazing stuff.

860
01:19:16,208 --> 01:19:17,125
Tastes like nectar.

861
01:19:17,208 --> 01:19:18,750
So go drink that.
Give my drink back.

862
01:19:18,833 --> 01:19:20,666
- Hold on.
- Give my drink back.

863
01:19:20,750 --> 01:19:21,916
You gave me liquor.

864
01:19:22,916 --> 01:19:25,875
But I gave you the
chance to give me liquor.

865
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:27,958
That's how big my heart is.

866
01:19:32,875 --> 01:19:34,541
What's my future, Bujji?

867
01:19:34,666 --> 01:19:37,208
How long should I drink
cheap liquor with the locals?

868
01:19:39,541 --> 01:19:41,958
Do you want to know your future?

869
01:19:42,041 --> 01:19:42,875
Fifty.

870
01:19:43,208 --> 01:19:44,375
Fifty units only.

871
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:46,333
Fifty.

872
01:19:47,416 --> 01:19:48,583
Start talking. I'll see.

873
01:19:48,875 --> 01:19:50,333
Hey, pretty parrot!

874
01:19:50,708 --> 01:19:52,916
Predict Bhairava's future.

875
01:20:05,250 --> 01:20:09,291
I've never seen such
a card in my entire life.

876
01:20:11,791 --> 01:20:14,041
Your life is about to change.

877
01:20:14,250 --> 01:20:16,166
So I'll go to the Complex. Thanks.

878
01:20:16,708 --> 01:20:18,166
They're all frauds, Bhairava.

879
01:20:19,208 --> 01:20:20,041
Bujji, listen.

880
01:20:20,375 --> 01:20:22,041
Don't demean our culture.

881
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,458
There are so many things
beyond our understanding.

882
01:20:24,541 --> 01:20:28,791
A big obstacle awaits you.

883
01:20:28,875 --> 01:20:29,958
I don't believe in all this.

884
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:31,083
Let's go, Bujji.

885
01:20:34,375 --> 01:20:36,916
Kashi has an underground tunnel network.

886
01:20:37,833 --> 01:20:40,166
The Complex isn't aware of it.

887
01:20:40,708 --> 01:20:44,208
If you want to leave the labs unnoticed,
this is the only way.

888
01:20:44,625 --> 01:20:45,458
There it is.

889
01:20:45,875 --> 01:20:48,208
My people will be
waiting at that tunnel.

890
01:21:12,375 --> 01:21:13,666
There's no time, SUM 80.

891
01:21:13,750 --> 01:21:15,916
Hurry up! This tunnel is your way out.

892
01:21:28,416 --> 01:21:29,291
Hurry up!

893
01:21:33,625 --> 01:21:34,541
Get out of here.

894
01:21:36,708 --> 01:21:38,833
- What about you?
- Don't worry about me.

895
01:21:40,666 --> 01:21:41,916
Good luck to both of you.

896
01:22:05,916 --> 01:22:09,458
Lilly made contact for the first
time after going undercover.

897
01:22:10,541 --> 01:22:12,333
So it must be something
really important.

898
01:22:13,583 --> 01:22:15,250
Maybe we should go inside.

899
01:22:18,458 --> 01:22:20,250
Shut up and get in the truck.

900
01:22:20,666 --> 01:22:22,166
We've lost so many of us already.

901
01:22:24,208 --> 01:22:25,750
We're returning to Shambala immediately.

902
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,125
It's a sign.

903
01:22:48,083 --> 01:22:49,000
What is it?

904
01:23:00,583 --> 01:23:01,708
The day River Ganga...

905
01:23:02,916 --> 01:23:06,000
is devoid of a single water droplet.

906
01:23:06,125 --> 01:23:07,375
What are you saying?

907
01:23:18,250 --> 01:23:19,375
It's a sign.

908
01:23:30,416 --> 01:23:32,000
This is my Shivamani.

909
01:23:34,041 --> 01:23:35,583
It's time to find her.

910
01:23:36,541 --> 01:23:37,458
Time for what?

911
01:23:47,250 --> 01:23:52,750
<i>You have been the protector
Of creation for ages</i>

912
01:23:52,833 --> 01:23:56,291
<i>You're the assassin of sinners</i>

913
01:23:56,375 --> 01:23:59,625
<i>The one who bestows hell upon them</i>

914
01:24:04,541 --> 01:24:06,250
Shit! The sensors got triggered.

915
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,250
Hey, there's somebody there.

916
01:24:27,083 --> 01:24:28,583
What's with the sudden gush of wind?

917
01:24:54,416 --> 01:25:00,000
<i>You have been the protector
Of creation for ages</i>

918
01:25:00,083 --> 01:25:03,250
<i>You're the assassin of sinners</i>

919
01:25:03,333 --> 01:25:05,708
<i>The one who bestows hell upon them</i>

920
01:25:05,791 --> 01:25:07,500
Hey! My 50 units.

921
01:25:07,583 --> 01:25:08,875
The units for my drink!

922
01:25:09,125 --> 01:25:10,833
What do you guys think of me?

923
01:25:12,333 --> 01:25:13,958
Do you know who you're talking to?

924
01:25:15,958 --> 01:25:17,500
Do you even know who I am?

925
01:25:18,333 --> 01:25:20,375
The Great Bhairava!

926
01:25:27,291 --> 01:25:28,791
Where are you going? Wait up.

927
01:25:34,416 --> 01:25:35,541
Who are you?

928
01:25:36,875 --> 01:25:38,500
I am Guru Drona's son.

929
01:25:39,333 --> 01:25:40,541
Ashwathama.

930
01:26:12,916 --> 01:26:13,875
He is here.

931
01:26:14,541 --> 01:26:16,666
The God of Kashi has returned.

932
01:26:31,041 --> 01:26:33,416
<i>The truth doesn't seek validation, Veeran.</i>

933
01:26:33,833 --> 01:26:34,791
<i>When the time comes...</i>

934
01:26:37,208 --> 01:26:39,041
<i>you'll see for yourself...</i>

935
01:26:39,875 --> 01:26:41,125
<i>that all these stories are true.</i>

936
01:26:44,458 --> 01:26:45,416
<i>God will return.</i>

937
01:26:55,625 --> 01:26:57,958
Something has changed, Bujji.

938
01:27:08,916 --> 01:27:10,500
They're fully fried.

939
01:27:10,583 --> 01:27:12,000
We didn't find the girl, sir.

940
01:27:12,875 --> 01:27:14,583
Should I go look for her?

941
01:27:15,333 --> 01:27:16,708
- Go!
- Yes, sir.

942
01:27:18,833 --> 01:27:22,791
Nobody can find out about this.

943
01:27:25,291 --> 01:27:26,250
Commander Manas.

944
01:27:27,750 --> 01:27:29,083
Bani is calling you.

945
01:27:29,875 --> 01:27:30,791
But, why?!

946
01:27:31,833 --> 01:27:33,916
Did somebody tell him?

947
01:27:34,125 --> 01:27:35,291
I don't know, sir.

948
01:27:51,458 --> 01:27:52,333
Recently,

949
01:27:52,666 --> 01:27:57,541
have you noticed anything
unusual in Kashi or at the labs?

950
01:28:01,833 --> 01:28:02,666
What is this?

951
01:28:04,208 --> 01:28:06,041
- Gaandeev.
- What's that?

952
01:28:06,208 --> 01:28:10,291
A weapon created by the
Creator himself, Lord Brahma.

953
01:28:10,458 --> 01:28:14,750
The man who knows how
to use this can defeat God.

954
01:28:15,208 --> 01:28:16,125
Really?

955
01:28:29,375 --> 01:28:30,583
Since last night,

956
01:28:30,916 --> 01:28:34,708
no human or machine could
come anywhere near this.

957
01:28:35,458 --> 01:28:37,375
Something is happening, Manas.

958
01:28:38,333 --> 01:28:39,833
We need to be alert.

959
01:28:40,583 --> 01:28:42,791
I'm sure everything
has a scientific reason.

960
01:28:42,875 --> 01:28:46,291
This is beyond our
scientific knowledge, Manas.

961
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,208
A new power has been awakened.

962
01:29:11,916 --> 01:29:13,458
You've been in the labs for so long.

963
01:29:14,291 --> 01:29:15,583
The air isn't clean outside.

964
01:29:16,375 --> 01:29:17,500
Put on the oxygen mask.

965
01:29:21,750 --> 01:29:22,708
What happened to Lilly?

966
01:29:25,916 --> 01:29:26,791
I don't know.

967
01:29:26,875 --> 01:29:28,208
Why did she save you?

968
01:29:31,208 --> 01:29:32,041
I don't know.

969
01:29:35,791 --> 01:29:36,833
What do they do at the labs?

970
01:29:38,458 --> 01:29:39,833
What's Project K?

971
01:29:41,833 --> 01:29:43,000
How can you be so clueless?

972
01:29:44,625 --> 01:29:45,833
You must know something!

973
01:30:02,625 --> 01:30:04,000
Hey, slowly.

974
01:30:04,791 --> 01:30:05,666
She's pregnant.

975
01:30:06,083 --> 01:30:09,500
I don't remember the last time
I saw a pregnant woman.

976
01:30:09,791 --> 01:30:11,375
Poor girl. Did you scare her?

977
01:30:13,208 --> 01:30:15,708
How can she say
"I don't know" to everything?

978
01:30:15,958 --> 01:30:17,958
Remember what Mariam used to say.

979
01:30:18,250 --> 01:30:20,125
Do you think she's the
woman from her stories?

980
01:30:20,833 --> 01:30:21,666
I don't know.

981
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:25,500
How can you say
"I don't know" to everything?

982
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:27,375
Here.

983
01:30:28,375 --> 01:30:29,833
I'll go say hi to her.

984
01:30:39,250 --> 01:30:40,958
He may come off as harsh but...

985
01:30:41,041 --> 01:30:42,458
Veeran's a good man.

986
01:30:45,083 --> 01:30:46,291
Are you trying to scare her?

987
01:30:46,583 --> 01:30:48,000
Where are you guys taking me?

988
01:30:48,958 --> 01:30:52,500
Listen, it's dangerous for you
to be out there with this belly.

989
01:30:52,750 --> 01:30:54,291
So, we're going to Shambala.

990
01:30:54,458 --> 01:30:56,541
You and your baby will be safe there.

991
01:30:58,666 --> 01:30:59,958
Can I touch it once?

992
01:31:00,791 --> 01:31:02,041
Kyra, stop!

993
01:31:02,541 --> 01:31:03,500
You're creeping her out.

994
01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:06,208
Sorry, I...

995
01:31:06,291 --> 01:31:09,208
I mean, we grew up
listening to Mariam's stories.

996
01:31:10,083 --> 01:31:13,375
She's been waiting for you forever.

997
01:31:13,458 --> 01:31:14,416
For me?

998
01:31:14,500 --> 01:31:15,583
Not just Mariam.

999
01:31:15,666 --> 01:31:20,166
Her mother, grandmother, and everyone
else have been waiting for you.

1000
01:31:20,250 --> 01:31:22,250
We know everything about you.

1001
01:31:22,416 --> 01:31:23,875
Well, what's your name?

1002
01:31:24,666 --> 01:31:26,541
Please don't tell me
that you don't know.

1003
01:31:28,041 --> 01:31:29,500
We don't have names.

1004
01:31:34,208 --> 01:31:35,541
Oh, SUM80.

1005
01:31:35,958 --> 01:31:37,666
Hi. My name is Kyra.

1006
01:31:38,083 --> 01:31:39,250
My dad gave me that name.

1007
01:31:39,416 --> 01:31:41,416
It means "Good luck" in some language.

1008
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:45,875
He died in the Complex
raid the day after I was born.

1009
01:31:46,291 --> 01:31:48,916
Maybe I wasn't lucky for him. Yeah.

1010
01:31:49,541 --> 01:31:53,125
That guy, cleaning the gun
like a psycho over there...

1011
01:31:53,208 --> 01:31:54,833
That's Ajju. My partner.

1012
01:31:55,583 --> 01:31:57,291
- Partner?
- Yeah.

1013
01:31:57,750 --> 01:31:59,041
By partner, I mean...

1014
01:32:00,166 --> 01:32:01,375
Yeah, he's mine.

1015
01:32:03,458 --> 01:32:04,958
Let me see a smile, Ajju.

1016
01:32:05,125 --> 01:32:06,125
A small one. Please.

1017
01:32:06,833 --> 01:32:09,375
They killed so many of us, Kyra.

1018
01:32:10,916 --> 01:32:11,875
As long as the Complex exists,

1019
01:32:12,625 --> 01:32:13,833
how can one smile?

1020
01:32:15,625 --> 01:32:17,375
From the inside, dude.

1021
01:32:17,458 --> 01:32:19,958
This is all we have. Come on, smile.

1022
01:32:20,083 --> 01:32:23,083
I'll smile after I kill
everyone at the Complex.

1023
01:32:23,375 --> 01:32:24,250
Okay?

1024
01:32:26,125 --> 01:32:27,750
He's such a charming fellow.

1025
01:32:27,958 --> 01:32:30,583
Nobody understands what
I saw in him in the first place.

1026
01:32:30,958 --> 01:32:33,916
We're getting married
after reaching Shambala.

1027
01:32:34,083 --> 01:32:36,125
I guess that makes you
the Chief Guest GU40.

1028
01:32:36,208 --> 01:32:37,416
GU40. G 40.

1029
01:32:38,083 --> 01:32:39,041
What's marriage?

1030
01:32:39,250 --> 01:32:40,166
Oh, right.

1031
01:32:40,666 --> 01:32:42,750
You're not aware of any of this.

1032
01:32:43,166 --> 01:32:45,500
Marriage is an old tradition.

1033
01:32:45,958 --> 01:32:48,250
You circle around the fire...

1034
01:32:48,416 --> 01:32:52,166
and promise each other
to live together forever.

1035
01:32:52,375 --> 01:32:53,208
And then?

1036
01:32:53,750 --> 01:32:55,083
And then...

1037
01:32:55,333 --> 01:32:56,333
And then...

1038
01:32:56,916 --> 01:32:57,791
That's it.

1039
01:32:58,583 --> 01:33:00,416
We'll live together.

1040
01:33:00,583 --> 01:33:02,958
We'll build a house,
have pet dogs, kids.

1041
01:33:04,666 --> 01:33:06,875
It sounds silly, I know.

1042
01:33:08,041 --> 01:33:08,875
No.

1043
01:33:09,541 --> 01:33:10,625
It sounds nice.

1044
01:33:11,125 --> 01:33:11,958
I know, right?

1045
01:33:13,166 --> 01:33:16,833
Everyone should have their
own person in this crazy world.

1046
01:33:18,208 --> 01:33:20,500
Humanity is one big family...

1047
01:33:21,166 --> 01:33:23,875
We should fight for the
greater good, that's all fine.

1048
01:33:24,250 --> 01:33:25,166
But...

1049
01:33:25,833 --> 01:33:28,041
You should have someone
you can call your own.

1050
01:33:30,083 --> 01:33:32,166
Someone's hand to hold.

1051
01:33:32,375 --> 01:33:34,500
Someone's shoulder to lean on.

1052
01:33:35,208 --> 01:33:38,458
That sense of belonging hits differently.

1053
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:42,458
Smile now at least.

1054
01:33:46,041 --> 01:33:47,541
You're cute, G 40.

1055
01:33:47,833 --> 01:33:48,791
G 40...

1056
01:33:48,875 --> 01:33:51,000
Kyra, her name is SUM 80.

1057
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,916
What kind of a name is SUM 80?

1058
01:33:54,041 --> 01:33:55,333
That's not a good name.

1059
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,416
SUM 80.

1060
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:00,875
SUM80.

1061
01:34:01,250 --> 01:34:02,125
Sumathi.

1062
01:34:02,208 --> 01:34:03,041
Sumathi?

1063
01:34:03,250 --> 01:34:04,083
Sumathi.

1064
01:34:06,375 --> 01:34:07,250
Sumathi.

1065
01:34:07,416 --> 01:34:08,500
It's a bit old-fashioned.

1066
01:34:08,791 --> 01:34:10,791
But it's better than SUM 80.

1067
01:34:15,416 --> 01:34:16,375
Don't be scared.

1068
01:34:21,833 --> 01:34:22,708
Raider.

1069
01:34:22,916 --> 01:34:24,666
Let him come. We got this.

1070
01:34:25,166 --> 01:34:26,458
Sometimes, you need to drop this...

1071
01:34:26,541 --> 01:34:27,666
and use this to win.

1072
01:34:41,791 --> 01:34:44,750
This is so far away from your village.

1073
01:34:46,750 --> 01:34:48,000
Tell me the truth.
Where are you coming from?

1074
01:34:48,958 --> 01:34:51,541
We came in the hopes of
finding some scrap to sell.

1075
01:34:55,500 --> 01:34:57,208
The competition is quite small here.

1076
01:34:59,166 --> 01:35:00,583
A woman has escaped from the labs.

1077
01:35:03,708 --> 01:35:05,000
Rebels aided her escape.

1078
01:35:06,750 --> 01:35:08,291
Do you know where she is?

1079
01:35:08,833 --> 01:35:10,541
Sir, we make a living
out of selling scrap.

1080
01:35:10,625 --> 01:35:11,708
We don't know anything.

1081
01:35:13,250 --> 01:35:14,208
Open the back.

1082
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:16,583
There's nothing back there, sir.

1083
01:35:17,500 --> 01:35:19,250
We had a rough day, sir.

1084
01:35:19,541 --> 01:35:20,833
We couldn't find any scrap.

1085
01:35:21,375 --> 01:35:22,708
Maybe I'll find something.

1086
01:35:24,041 --> 01:35:27,375
I can pay you some units if you want.

1087
01:35:27,458 --> 01:35:28,666
I said open the back!

1088
01:35:29,166 --> 01:35:30,708
Okay, sir. Okay, sir.

1089
01:35:45,041 --> 01:35:47,958
- There's nothing here.
- I told you, sir.

1090
01:35:50,708 --> 01:35:52,125
Yeah, you're really trash.

1091
01:35:56,666 --> 01:35:57,500
Let's go.

1092
01:36:04,750 --> 01:36:05,833
There's nothing in there, sir.

1093
01:36:06,041 --> 01:36:07,458
Sir, listen to me.

1094
01:36:07,625 --> 01:36:08,458
- Sir...
- Wait.

1095
01:36:26,375 --> 01:36:27,208
Boom.

1096
01:36:42,791 --> 01:36:44,750
He has sent a bounty alert. Get up.

1097
01:36:45,458 --> 01:36:46,958
Let's give the brains a rest.

1098
01:36:52,416 --> 01:36:53,875
It's time to fire the guns.

1099
01:37:10,333 --> 01:37:11,166
Dude...

1100
01:37:11,708 --> 01:37:13,000
Tell me this.

1101
01:37:14,208 --> 01:37:15,875
The entire house is empty.

1102
01:37:16,125 --> 01:37:17,666
So is your car.

1103
01:37:17,958 --> 01:37:19,416
Why don't you sleep over there?

1104
01:37:19,583 --> 01:37:21,291
Why do you have to sleep here only?

1105
01:37:22,958 --> 01:37:24,416
My life is over there.

1106
01:37:25,958 --> 01:37:26,833
Hey, old man.

1107
01:37:27,083 --> 01:37:29,250
Guess what I'll do once
I enter the Complex.

1108
01:37:29,708 --> 01:37:31,375
You will do whatever the hell you want.

1109
01:37:31,458 --> 01:37:32,666
But you won't pay my rent.

1110
01:37:32,958 --> 01:37:33,875
No, listen.

1111
01:37:34,166 --> 01:37:35,750
Once I enter the Complex,

1112
01:37:36,083 --> 01:37:38,500
I'll breathe in kilos of fresh air.

1113
01:37:39,125 --> 01:37:40,666
- Let me...
- Hey, back off.

1114
01:37:41,291 --> 01:37:42,541
You took my food.

1115
01:37:42,625 --> 01:37:43,958
You occupied my bed.

1116
01:37:44,041 --> 01:37:45,958
Now you want to steal my oxygen as well?

1117
01:37:46,041 --> 01:37:46,875
Listen.

1118
01:37:47,291 --> 01:37:49,291
Let's come to an understanding.

1119
01:37:49,666 --> 01:37:52,041
Find a nice girl and settle down in life.

1120
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:54,583
How long will you stay in my house?

1121
01:37:54,666 --> 01:37:56,625
Do you think I love staying with you?

1122
01:37:57,125 --> 01:37:59,583
One big bounty. One shot.

1123
01:38:00,041 --> 01:38:02,083
- I'll go to the Complex.
- And do what?

1124
01:38:03,708 --> 01:38:06,666
I'll live happily over there.

1125
01:38:06,750 --> 01:38:09,083
Happiness should come from within.

1126
01:38:10,291 --> 01:38:11,500
Go ahead, cough it out.

1127
01:38:11,875 --> 01:38:14,708
You'll only get a cough
from within if you stay here.

1128
01:38:15,208 --> 01:38:17,458
I can't live here anymore.
I'll leave soon.

1129
01:38:19,791 --> 01:38:20,750
Alert! Alert!

1130
01:38:21,041 --> 01:38:22,833
{\an8}Five-star bounty.
Rebels on the run.

1131
01:38:24,125 --> 01:38:25,500
It's a jackpot, old man.

1132
01:38:26,208 --> 01:38:28,875
It's time to pay your rent.

1133
01:38:44,333 --> 01:38:46,000
A raider vehicle is
already headed this way.

1134
01:38:50,708 --> 01:38:51,833
I'll handle the raiders.

1135
01:38:53,791 --> 01:38:54,666
Here you go.

1136
01:39:00,208 --> 01:39:02,250
I'll go after him.
You stay here.

1137
01:39:06,916 --> 01:39:07,791
For tomorrow...

1138
01:39:10,666 --> 01:39:12,208
Hey, Sumathi. Don't worry.

1139
01:39:12,291 --> 01:39:13,750
Kyra means lucky, remember?

1140
01:39:18,625 --> 01:39:19,750
I'll be right back.

1141
01:39:46,708 --> 01:39:47,541
Where did she go?

1142
01:39:55,458 --> 01:39:56,291
Hi, guys.

1143
01:39:57,375 --> 01:39:58,208
Catch.

1144
01:39:59,375 --> 01:40:00,416
Ah, good catch!

1145
01:40:14,833 --> 01:40:17,916
If you don't stop that truck,
you'll be the first to die.

1146
01:41:21,625 --> 01:41:22,791
Veeran!

1147
01:41:37,333 --> 01:41:38,166
Ajju...

1148
01:43:04,583 --> 01:43:06,625
Sumathi, did you get scared?

1149
01:43:07,208 --> 01:43:08,875
Didn't I tell you that I'm lucky?

1150
01:43:26,916 --> 01:43:27,750
Kyra!

1151
01:43:28,916 --> 01:43:29,750
Ajju...

1152
01:43:46,833 --> 01:43:48,208
Let me see a smile, Ajju.

1153
01:43:50,541 --> 01:43:51,625
Kyra!

1154
01:44:08,416 --> 01:44:09,333
Ajju.

1155
01:44:13,208 --> 01:44:14,041
What's wrong?

1156
01:44:17,291 --> 01:44:18,458
Kyra...

1157
01:44:27,500 --> 01:44:29,208
Four teams in pursuit of bounty.

1158
01:44:29,791 --> 01:44:30,666
We're last.

1159
01:44:30,750 --> 01:44:33,333
Chances of bounty, 0.18 percent.

1160
01:44:33,625 --> 01:44:37,250
- Bujji, can you clarify a doubt for me?
- Sure.

1161
01:44:37,583 --> 01:44:40,250
How can you fit so much negativity
in that small brain?

1162
01:44:41,333 --> 01:44:44,791
Never mind. I'm getting
really good vibes today.

1163
01:44:49,333 --> 01:44:50,291
Who's that?

1164
01:44:58,416 --> 01:45:00,250
Hi, sir. I haven't seen you in a while.

1165
01:45:00,708 --> 01:45:01,625
What's with the shaved head?

1166
01:45:01,958 --> 01:45:02,791
Is everything okay?

1167
01:45:09,041 --> 01:45:12,000
You took the car parts
promising to work for me.

1168
01:45:12,583 --> 01:45:14,625
How long will you keep running from me?

1169
01:45:14,708 --> 01:45:16,541
It's just car parts, sir.
I'll dismantle them again.

1170
01:45:16,791 --> 01:45:17,791
I don't consent to that.

1171
01:45:18,750 --> 01:45:20,833
I'm not here for the car parts.

1172
01:45:21,250 --> 01:45:22,250
I'm here for you.

1173
01:45:23,333 --> 01:45:26,250
Damn! I'm screwed for
five years if he catches me.

1174
01:45:26,583 --> 01:45:28,125
Bujji, full speed.

1175
01:45:28,500 --> 01:45:29,666
We're at maximum speed.

1176
01:45:29,875 --> 01:45:32,625
Then turn on flight mode.

1177
01:45:32,833 --> 01:45:34,000
We're at maximum speed.

1178
01:45:34,083 --> 01:45:34,958
Bujji!

1179
01:45:35,250 --> 01:45:38,166
For once in life, just for today,

1180
01:45:38,416 --> 01:45:39,416
just be positive.

1181
01:45:40,833 --> 01:45:41,708
It's an order.

1182
01:45:42,250 --> 01:45:43,625
Flight mode on.

1183
01:45:54,333 --> 01:45:55,208
Hey, Bhairava!

1184
01:45:55,708 --> 01:45:56,875
I'll find you again.

1185
01:45:57,333 --> 01:45:58,750
And this time, I'll keep
you hooked for ten years.

1186
01:45:59,166 --> 01:46:00,000
Ten years!

1187
01:46:00,333 --> 01:46:01,666
Yeah, yeah, we'll see.

1188
01:46:02,750 --> 01:46:04,625
Always trust your boss, Bujji.

1189
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:06,583
Everything will be alright.

1190
01:46:08,333 --> 01:46:10,583
Warning! Warning!
Flight system failure.

1191
01:46:11,416 --> 01:46:12,791
Bhairava! Bhairava!

1192
01:46:20,791 --> 01:46:22,250
Can I be negative now?

1193
01:46:38,125 --> 01:46:38,958
Hey, Ajju!

1194
01:46:40,250 --> 01:46:41,125
Ajju, come here.

1195
01:47:45,958 --> 01:47:46,833
Hey, Ajju!

1196
01:47:47,500 --> 01:47:48,375
Hey, Ajju!

1197
01:47:50,208 --> 01:47:51,625
- Ajju!
- The girl is in the truck.

1198
01:47:51,833 --> 01:47:52,666
Go get her.

1199
01:47:55,416 --> 01:47:56,583
Will you save her?

1200
01:47:58,416 --> 01:47:59,750
Who will save you?

1201
01:48:08,250 --> 01:48:09,083
Hi, guys.

1202
01:48:09,541 --> 01:48:11,000
Sorry, did I disturb you?

1203
01:48:12,333 --> 01:48:14,833
I suggest you drop
the guns and leave.

1204
01:48:17,375 --> 01:48:19,458
I'm saying it for your own good.

1205
01:48:19,541 --> 01:48:20,750
Should I listen to you now?

1206
01:48:20,916 --> 01:48:22,166
No, listen to my teacher.

1207
01:48:32,166 --> 01:48:33,041
She's here.

1208
01:48:34,958 --> 01:48:36,208
I can sense that she's here.

1209
01:48:37,208 --> 01:48:40,458
Hey, old man. You look like you're
retired and approaching death.

1210
01:48:40,791 --> 01:48:42,041
You could use some help.

1211
01:48:42,333 --> 01:48:43,833
Fire!

1212
01:48:49,500 --> 01:48:51,500
I guess your war has begun again.

1213
01:48:52,083 --> 01:48:52,958
War?

1214
01:48:56,291 --> 01:48:57,791
This isn't war to me.

1215
01:48:59,041 --> 01:49:01,833
It's like the worship of weapons
before going to war.

1216
01:49:26,208 --> 01:49:27,041
Bye!

1217
01:49:28,750 --> 01:49:29,625
Hi.

1218
01:49:30,791 --> 01:49:31,666
Is he okay?

1219
01:49:33,708 --> 01:49:34,541
How are you here?

1220
01:49:36,625 --> 01:49:37,458
Hey.

1221
01:49:37,750 --> 01:49:38,791
Where's the gem?

1222
01:50:04,666 --> 01:50:05,541
Hi.

1223
01:50:06,750 --> 01:50:07,916
My name is Raia.

1224
01:50:08,708 --> 01:50:09,666
What's your name?

1225
01:50:11,583 --> 01:50:12,500
Sumathi.

1226
01:50:14,583 --> 01:50:15,666
Don't be scared.

1227
01:50:15,750 --> 01:50:17,875
My teacher has got this.

1228
01:51:19,583 --> 01:51:20,416
Mother...

1229
01:51:57,083 --> 01:51:59,208
Bujji, what's happening exactly?

1230
01:51:59,291 --> 01:52:00,875
We're traveling upside down.

1231
01:52:08,166 --> 01:52:10,875
- Who's that giant man?
- Eight-foot angry giant.

1232
01:52:10,958 --> 01:52:12,583
He's attacking all the raiders.

1233
01:52:16,833 --> 01:52:18,083
He cut down my work by half.

1234
01:52:18,166 --> 01:52:19,000
Is the bounty there?

1235
01:52:19,083 --> 01:52:20,541
The bounty is in
the back of the truck.

1236
01:52:20,791 --> 01:52:24,541
Bujji, ask the Complex
to open their gates.

1237
01:52:24,625 --> 01:52:25,625
I am coming!

1238
01:52:37,166 --> 01:52:38,958
I'll have a real egg
at the Complex.

1239
01:52:39,416 --> 01:52:41,125
And crack open skulls
like they're eggshells.

1240
01:52:43,458 --> 01:52:45,083
I'll also swim in the sea.

1241
01:52:48,958 --> 01:52:50,625
Massage.

1242
01:52:52,500 --> 01:52:53,416
Thai...

1243
01:52:53,875 --> 01:52:55,500
massage.

1244
01:52:58,208 --> 01:53:00,041
Woah! My Complex.

1245
01:53:09,833 --> 01:53:10,666
Hi.

1246
01:53:11,458 --> 01:53:12,375
Hi.

1247
01:53:13,791 --> 01:53:14,625
Bye.

1248
01:53:59,833 --> 01:54:01,791
Hi.

1249
01:54:30,208 --> 01:54:31,833
That old man hit me so hard.

1250
01:54:33,416 --> 01:54:35,625
Woah! My Complex.

1251
01:55:02,041 --> 01:55:03,833
Where have you come from, sir?

1252
01:55:06,333 --> 01:55:07,250
Okay, don't tell me.

1253
01:55:33,416 --> 01:55:34,333
Okay.

1254
01:55:34,833 --> 01:55:35,791
That's enough.

1255
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,291
Hey! Love you, Bujji!

1256
01:56:23,500 --> 01:56:25,458
Now Bujji is here, you old man!

1257
01:56:39,125 --> 01:56:40,041
Bhairava!

1258
01:57:22,375 --> 01:57:24,083
This old man is a tough nut!

1259
01:57:38,583 --> 01:57:39,500
Not again...

1260
01:58:38,416 --> 01:58:39,250
Statue!

1261
01:59:15,833 --> 01:59:17,500
150 days.

1262
01:59:18,375 --> 01:59:20,708
A formula we deemed impossible.

1263
01:59:22,416 --> 01:59:26,500
Where's the serum that
was extracted from her?

1264
01:59:26,583 --> 01:59:28,208
We could extract only a drop, Bani.

1265
01:59:29,083 --> 01:59:30,916
Please don't tell Supreme.

1266
01:59:31,833 --> 01:59:33,375
We almost had her.

1267
01:59:34,375 --> 01:59:36,333
There was an old man
who was eight feet tall.

1268
01:59:38,750 --> 01:59:41,583
He escaped unscathed even after
firing several rounds at him.

1269
01:59:42,666 --> 01:59:45,125
Did he have a gem on his forehead?

1270
01:59:47,708 --> 01:59:48,625
Yes.

1271
01:59:50,250 --> 01:59:52,333
It looked like some sort of light.

1272
01:59:53,708 --> 01:59:54,958
Ashwathama!

1273
01:59:56,791 --> 01:59:59,500
He wasn't born in this yuga.

1274
01:59:59,875 --> 02:00:01,583
He is immortal.

1275
02:00:02,666 --> 02:00:04,791
The Puranas are coming true.

1276
02:00:05,791 --> 02:00:08,666
Ashwathama, the pregnant woman,

1277
02:00:09,166 --> 02:00:10,541
and the Gaandeev.

1278
02:00:11,833 --> 02:00:15,958
God created this weapon
when he was on Earth.

1279
02:00:16,416 --> 02:00:21,375
After God left, these weapons
lost their power.

1280
02:00:22,083 --> 02:00:24,875
If that power has returned now,
that means...

1281
02:00:25,708 --> 02:00:28,083
It means that God is coming back.

1282
02:00:29,250 --> 02:00:31,708
He is growing inside that woman's womb.

1283
02:00:32,041 --> 02:00:35,083
I've heard my fair share
of these silly stories.

1284
02:00:35,625 --> 02:00:38,875
Some God will appear on a white horse.

1285
02:00:39,958 --> 02:00:43,041
Our ancestors put it quite intelligently.

1286
02:00:43,750 --> 02:00:47,708
The white horse refers to his birth star.

1287
02:00:48,208 --> 02:00:52,791
The Khadga Ashwini star,
which appears once every 6000 years.

1288
02:00:55,125 --> 02:00:59,166
All the planets are going
to align in a few days,

1289
02:00:59,250 --> 02:01:02,083
leading to a rare eclipse formation.

1290
02:01:02,166 --> 02:01:05,500
The darkest day in 6000 years.

1291
02:01:08,041 --> 02:01:10,708
If the baby isn't born before that...

1292
02:01:11,166 --> 02:01:15,166
the star won't appear
for another 6000 years.

1293
02:01:15,291 --> 02:01:19,250
We need to stop this birth at any cost.

1294
02:01:19,500 --> 02:01:22,041
Otherwise, it's a threat
to Supreme's life.

1295
02:01:36,500 --> 02:01:37,375
Where are you going?

1296
02:01:39,708 --> 02:01:40,541
Hello.

1297
02:01:40,958 --> 02:01:41,875
There's no road ahead.

1298
02:01:42,541 --> 02:01:43,875
We'll crash into the mountain.

1299
02:01:46,416 --> 02:01:47,541
Ashwa uncle, help!

1300
02:02:00,125 --> 02:02:02,666
Mariam, Mariam, Mariam!

1301
02:02:02,750 --> 02:02:04,791
- Mariam...
- Mariam, a huge...

1302
02:02:07,583 --> 02:02:09,083
A really huge giant.

1303
02:02:09,291 --> 02:02:10,791
What are you saying? Be clear.

1304
02:02:11,125 --> 02:02:12,250
The Mother has arrived.

1305
02:02:19,708 --> 02:02:20,541
What happened?

1306
02:02:22,083 --> 02:02:22,916
Where's Kyra?

1307
02:02:23,833 --> 02:02:24,916
Where's everyone else?

1308
02:02:28,916 --> 02:02:29,791
For tomorrow...

1309
02:02:36,500 --> 02:02:37,666
Hey, drop him.

1310
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:38,833
Drop him!

1311
02:02:40,083 --> 02:02:41,250
- Hey, drop...
- Drop the gun.

1312
02:02:41,458 --> 02:02:42,291
Drop it!

1313
02:02:42,375 --> 02:02:44,041
Sir, they're one of us.

1314
02:02:44,208 --> 02:02:45,041
Sir... Sir...

1315
02:02:46,375 --> 02:02:48,541
Hey! I said drop the gun!

1316
02:02:49,041 --> 02:02:49,875
Drop it!

1317
02:02:51,333 --> 02:02:52,166
Sir.

1318
02:02:55,500 --> 02:02:56,333
Come.

1319
02:02:56,791 --> 02:02:57,708
Careful.

1320
02:03:00,416 --> 02:03:01,291
Come.

1321
02:03:03,208 --> 02:03:04,875
Veeran, who is this?

1322
02:03:05,750 --> 02:03:06,625
I don't know.

1323
02:03:07,750 --> 02:03:08,666
But...

1324
02:03:09,125 --> 02:03:10,583
he's definitely not our enemy.

1325
02:03:34,916 --> 02:03:36,750
Is she the woman who escaped from the lab?

1326
02:03:41,916 --> 02:03:43,625
Why did you bring her here?

1327
02:03:44,333 --> 02:03:47,041
A five million bounty has
been announced on her.

1328
02:03:47,750 --> 02:03:51,541
Thanks to the Complex,
the whole world is after her.

1329
02:03:51,958 --> 02:03:53,250
How will you save her?

1330
02:03:53,333 --> 02:03:54,458
I will save her.

1331
02:03:57,458 --> 02:03:58,500
Who the hell are you?

1332
02:03:58,583 --> 02:04:00,000
Being tall isn't enough.

1333
02:04:00,208 --> 02:04:01,750
Have you ever been to war?

1334
02:04:01,833 --> 02:04:02,708
Excuse me.

1335
02:04:02,875 --> 02:04:06,208
He fought a war with Sri Krishna
in the Mahabharata. Okay?

1336
02:04:08,458 --> 02:04:11,500
Maybe we can take her to the flux lands.

1337
02:04:11,916 --> 02:04:13,000
They can't track us there.

1338
02:04:13,625 --> 02:04:15,458
The Nomens will eat her.

1339
02:04:16,083 --> 02:04:18,625
Veeran, I want her
out of here this instant.

1340
02:04:19,083 --> 02:04:20,333
She will not be going anywhere.

1341
02:04:26,458 --> 02:04:30,458
You arrived before my hope could falter.

1342
02:04:32,666 --> 02:04:33,666
The Mother has arrived.

1343
02:04:34,333 --> 02:04:35,666
She came to her maternal home...

1344
02:04:36,291 --> 02:04:37,500
to give birth to God.

1345
02:04:39,291 --> 02:04:41,375
Tell Shambala the Mother has arrived.

1346
02:04:47,875 --> 02:04:48,875
Hey, stop!

1347
02:04:49,375 --> 02:04:50,291
Stop!

1348
02:04:51,500 --> 02:04:52,916
Has everybody gone crazy?

1349
02:04:54,458 --> 02:04:58,000
Do you realize that her mere
presence has put us all in danger?

1350
02:05:00,083 --> 02:05:04,458
She's an ordinary pregnant woman
who escaped from the lab.

1351
02:05:04,541 --> 02:05:06,083
There's nothing special about her.

1352
02:05:08,291 --> 02:05:09,208
Moreover...

1353
02:05:10,291 --> 02:05:12,333
how can you claim that this unborn child

1354
02:05:13,166 --> 02:05:14,416
is our next God?

1355
02:05:23,750 --> 02:05:24,666
Rain?

1356
02:05:26,125 --> 02:05:28,041
When was the last time it rained?

1357
02:05:40,916 --> 02:05:41,791
For tomorrow.

1358
02:06:40,791 --> 02:06:42,833
Ashwa uncle, I can't see anything.

1359
02:07:25,166 --> 02:07:26,041
Listen, dear.

1360
02:07:27,416 --> 02:07:30,250
Shambala has waited a long time for you.

1361
02:07:33,916 --> 02:07:36,416
We're ready to do anything for you.

1362
02:07:38,500 --> 02:07:39,375
Tell us, Mother.

1363
02:07:39,583 --> 02:07:40,833
What do you want?

1364
02:07:41,958 --> 02:07:43,166
I'm hungry.

1365
02:07:50,791 --> 02:07:52,500
This tree is like a temple to us.

1366
02:08:16,208 --> 02:08:17,166
It's clean water.

1367
02:08:17,666 --> 02:08:18,625
You can drink it.

1368
02:08:20,541 --> 02:08:21,375
Here you go.

1369
02:08:36,916 --> 02:08:38,375
How is all of this here?

1370
02:08:39,041 --> 02:08:42,125
The compass that found you was from here.

1371
02:08:43,666 --> 02:08:45,625
That's the point this tree grew from.

1372
02:08:47,333 --> 02:08:50,583
And that's how Shambala
came to life around this tree.

1373
02:08:51,416 --> 02:08:54,208
Just when we were concerned
about losing that life energy,

1374
02:08:54,625 --> 02:08:55,583
you showed up.

1375
02:08:58,541 --> 02:09:00,500
Shambala's belief came true.

1376
02:09:02,250 --> 02:09:04,458
Hereafter, everything will be fine.

1377
02:09:17,875 --> 02:09:18,791
Where's the old man?

1378
02:09:19,250 --> 02:09:21,375
He's the guy who hit us.

1379
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:25,041
She escaped because of him.

1380
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,208
Bhairava, you're blacklisted.

1381
02:09:41,708 --> 02:09:43,208
We're seizing all your units.

1382
02:09:44,291 --> 02:09:46,458
{\an8}You're permanently
banned from the Complex.

1383
02:10:04,083 --> 02:10:04,958
What's wrong?

1384
02:10:05,083 --> 02:10:06,083
I lost.

1385
02:10:06,166 --> 02:10:08,083
What? You lost?

1386
02:10:09,125 --> 02:10:10,166
Impossible!

1387
02:10:10,666 --> 02:10:11,625
I don't believe you.

1388
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:15,916
Go.

1389
02:10:17,625 --> 02:10:18,458
What?

1390
02:10:19,125 --> 02:10:19,958
Are you letting me go?

1391
02:10:20,041 --> 02:10:22,125
When did you become such a saint?

1392
02:10:23,166 --> 02:10:24,625
He's a good guy, sir.

1393
02:10:25,208 --> 02:10:27,416
Bujji, give him those 500 units.

1394
02:10:27,625 --> 02:10:28,666
He'll grab a bite.

1395
02:10:29,083 --> 02:10:31,291
Are you going to pay my rent as well?

1396
02:10:32,083 --> 02:10:33,708
If so, please inform me in advance.

1397
02:10:33,833 --> 02:10:35,333
I don't want a shock.

1398
02:10:37,166 --> 02:10:40,166
I'll do some work
and pay your rent, old man.

1399
02:10:44,208 --> 02:10:47,416
I fought a great deal to go to
the Complex all these years.

1400
02:10:49,208 --> 02:10:50,250
It's all over now.

1401
02:10:57,416 --> 02:10:59,458
I finally gained a sense of clarity.

1402
02:11:01,083 --> 02:11:02,333
This is my life right here.

1403
02:11:04,583 --> 02:11:05,750
I don't have anybody.

1404
02:11:08,083 --> 02:11:09,916
Nobody needs me.

1405
02:11:15,666 --> 02:11:17,083
We need you, Bhairava.

1406
02:11:18,166 --> 02:11:19,375
You shouldn't stay back here.

1407
02:11:20,250 --> 02:11:21,958
Come with me to Shambala.

1408
02:11:22,958 --> 02:11:23,833
Shambala...

1409
02:11:25,416 --> 02:11:26,291
You go.

1410
02:11:28,375 --> 02:11:30,291
Who would take me inside anyway?

1411
02:11:30,666 --> 02:11:32,125
Hey, I'll talk to them.

1412
02:11:32,500 --> 02:11:34,583
You're a hero to so many others like me.

1413
02:11:35,041 --> 02:11:36,208
Come be on our side, Bhairava.

1414
02:11:36,291 --> 02:11:37,583
Don't hesitate. Let's go.

1415
02:11:38,416 --> 02:11:39,458
<i>Damn, those rebels!</i>

1416
02:11:39,708 --> 02:11:41,291
<i>They must've taken her to Shambala.</i>

1417
02:11:41,708 --> 02:11:43,125
<i>I want that woman!</i>

1418
02:11:43,375 --> 02:11:46,416
We've sent raiders in
every direction, Commander.

1419
02:11:46,833 --> 02:11:47,666
We'll catch her.

1420
02:11:47,750 --> 02:11:49,000
You can't do shit.

1421
02:11:50,625 --> 02:11:53,000
You can't do shit as long
as that old man is with her.

1422
02:11:53,416 --> 02:11:54,333
<i>Old man?</i>

1423
02:11:54,583 --> 02:11:56,458
He's the one who thrashed your men.

1424
02:11:56,791 --> 02:11:58,666
Nobody could lay their hand on him.

1425
02:12:00,875 --> 02:12:02,333
Except for me.

1426
02:12:03,208 --> 02:12:04,166
<i>Who is this guy?</i>

1427
02:12:04,875 --> 02:12:05,791
He's Bhairava, sir.

1428
02:12:06,083 --> 02:12:07,083
A bounty hunter.

1429
02:12:07,375 --> 02:12:08,875
He hit our raiders.

1430
02:12:09,208 --> 02:12:10,458
I blacklisted him.

1431
02:12:10,708 --> 02:12:12,458
Now that you've blacklisted me anyway,

1432
02:12:12,541 --> 02:12:13,541
let me hit again.

1433
02:12:20,166 --> 02:12:22,958
The point is, only I can bring her back.

1434
02:12:25,125 --> 02:12:26,666
You have no other option.

1435
02:12:27,291 --> 02:12:28,416
<i>How can you be so sure?</i>

1436
02:12:29,708 --> 02:12:31,125
Check my records.

1437
02:12:31,916 --> 02:12:33,958
I haven't lost a single fight till now.

1438
02:12:35,083 --> 02:12:36,666
I won't lose this one either.

1439
02:12:37,791 --> 02:12:38,625
<i>Alright.</i>

1440
02:12:39,083 --> 02:12:40,125
<i>I'll give you one chance.</i>

1441
02:12:41,416 --> 02:12:42,750
<i>If you bring her back,</i>

1442
02:12:43,333 --> 02:12:47,000
<i>I'll personally hold your hand
and take you inside the Complex.</i>

1443
02:13:12,875 --> 02:13:16,333
<i>This light doesn't come</i>

1444
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:22,208
{\an8}<i>To cross over the darkness</i>

1445
02:13:22,291 --> 02:13:23,125
{\an8}MOTHER

1446
02:13:23,666 --> 02:13:27,333
{\an8}<i>Where everything is barren</i>

1447
02:13:27,833 --> 02:13:33,041
<i>May there be a drop in the cloud</i>

1448
02:13:34,541 --> 02:13:38,125
<i>The morning sun</i>

1449
02:13:38,458 --> 02:13:43,625
<i>Is colored with the blood of the night</i>

1450
02:13:45,666 --> 02:13:52,666
<i>This storm is the flight of tomorrow</i>

1451
02:14:34,250 --> 02:14:41,083
<i>This is the proclamation...
Be victorious</i>

1452
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:58,750
Give her some space.

1453
02:15:05,125 --> 02:15:06,583
Let's throw this cane away now.

1454
02:15:07,333 --> 02:15:09,291
We'll get you a kickass
weapon in Shambala.

1455
02:15:10,500 --> 02:15:12,000
This isn't an ordinary cane.

1456
02:15:13,583 --> 02:15:15,416
It's a weapon from an ancient war.

1457
02:15:16,208 --> 02:15:18,291
So, tell me.
What was your war like?

1458
02:15:18,916 --> 02:15:21,000
Was it more depressing
than the current wars?

1459
02:15:23,125 --> 02:15:25,208
Were there a lot of casualties?

1460
02:15:27,291 --> 02:15:29,625
Anyway, I'm sure you
were the best fighter.

1461
02:15:29,916 --> 02:15:30,833
No one can beat you.

1462
02:15:32,583 --> 02:15:33,958
No, I lost.

1463
02:15:39,375 --> 02:15:40,250
Really?

1464
02:15:41,125 --> 02:15:42,000
Who defeated you?

1465
02:15:42,666 --> 02:15:44,541
The Master of the Gaandeev.
Kunthi's son.

1466
02:15:45,875 --> 02:15:46,791
Arjuna.

1467
02:15:55,791 --> 02:15:57,083
Ashwathama!

1468
02:15:57,791 --> 02:16:00,958
This is the Gaandeev made
by the Creator, Brahma.

1469
02:16:01,625 --> 02:16:03,500
Nobody can fight it.

1470
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,875
Oh, so Arjuna was the best?

1471
02:16:11,708 --> 02:16:12,541
Right?

1472
02:16:13,166 --> 02:16:14,041
No.

1473
02:16:17,541 --> 02:16:19,041
There was another warrior.

1474
02:16:19,541 --> 02:16:21,000
More powerful than Arjuna?

1475
02:16:21,750 --> 02:16:22,625
Yes.

1476
02:16:25,041 --> 02:16:26,416
He was my friend.

1477
02:16:27,208 --> 02:16:28,208
What happened to him?

1478
02:16:28,666 --> 02:16:29,500
Karn.

1479
02:16:31,458 --> 02:16:32,666
He met with a miserable death.

1480
02:16:33,291 --> 02:16:35,458
A warrior like him didn't deserve it.

1481
02:16:37,166 --> 02:16:40,000
This weapon belonged to him.

1482
02:16:42,041 --> 02:16:43,791
It's more powerful than...

1483
02:16:45,375 --> 02:16:47,041
Arjuna's Gaandeev.

1484
02:16:49,958 --> 02:16:50,875
Wow!

1485
02:16:52,333 --> 02:16:54,791
Then why don't you use it?

1486
02:16:55,500 --> 02:16:57,208
It works only in his hands.

1487
02:16:59,166 --> 02:17:00,125
Without him...

1488
02:17:01,875 --> 02:17:03,166
this weapon is powerless.

1489
02:17:06,291 --> 02:17:09,750
Right now, this is as good
as an old man's walking stick.

1490
02:17:20,291 --> 02:17:21,583
Your current balance is zero.

1491
02:17:22,333 --> 02:17:25,250
You've exhausted
all your units on me, Bhairava.

1492
02:17:25,875 --> 02:17:26,833
Bhairava, are you sure?

1493
02:17:28,791 --> 02:17:30,083
There's no going back.

1494
02:18:51,833 --> 02:18:53,500
Where do you think you're going?

1495
02:18:54,041 --> 02:18:56,250
I'll follow you wherever you go, Mother.

1496
02:18:58,166 --> 02:19:00,083
Why is everyone calling me Mother?

1497
02:19:00,375 --> 02:19:01,625
They say that...

1498
02:19:02,875 --> 02:19:05,333
the entire universe resides within God.

1499
02:19:07,291 --> 02:19:08,791
But that God resides within you.

1500
02:19:11,083 --> 02:19:15,041
What else can we call you if not Mother?

1501
02:19:15,750 --> 02:19:16,666
As you please.

1502
02:19:17,291 --> 02:19:18,750
But first, I need to get out of here.

1503
02:19:19,125 --> 02:19:20,333
The outside is a threat, Mother.

1504
02:19:20,666 --> 02:19:21,541
To who?

1505
02:19:22,416 --> 02:19:24,000
In fact, I'm a threat to everyone.

1506
02:19:24,083 --> 02:19:26,208
People around me end up dying.

1507
02:19:26,291 --> 02:19:27,416
I won't die.

1508
02:19:35,375 --> 02:19:36,541
The gun was in my hand.

1509
02:19:39,125 --> 02:19:41,208
Kyra would've been
alive if I had fired it.

1510
02:19:41,666 --> 02:19:44,125
You were born to bring another life into
this world. Not cause someone's death.

1511
02:19:45,916 --> 02:19:47,541
Are you listening to yourself?

1512
02:19:48,750 --> 02:19:50,708
How can a baby that hasn't
taken its first breath

1513
02:19:50,791 --> 02:19:53,000
be responsible for so many
people breathing their last?

1514
02:19:53,250 --> 02:19:55,250
Every death has a higher purpose.

1515
02:19:57,375 --> 02:20:00,458
This baby will give life to the world.

1516
02:20:05,208 --> 02:20:06,083
But why me?

1517
02:20:12,291 --> 02:20:14,916
God gives his biggest responsibilities...

1518
02:20:16,250 --> 02:20:19,083
to the ones who can fulfill them.

1519
02:20:21,625 --> 02:20:23,458
You're carrying God...

1520
02:20:24,541 --> 02:20:26,041
in your womb.

1521
02:20:30,083 --> 02:20:32,416
Only Mother Earth possesses
that kind of power.

1522
02:20:35,041 --> 02:20:36,125
Do you even realize that...

1523
02:20:38,875 --> 02:20:42,000
what you're carrying
is not an ordinary life?

1524
02:20:42,708 --> 02:20:44,416
Birthing it is your duty.

1525
02:20:47,750 --> 02:20:50,208
Protecting you is my responsibility.

1526
02:20:59,291 --> 02:21:00,208
Are you sure?

1527
02:21:01,166 --> 02:21:02,333
Do you remember the way?

1528
02:21:03,250 --> 02:21:05,000
I was born there, Bhairava.

1529
02:21:05,375 --> 02:21:06,541
Of course, I remember.

1530
02:21:14,333 --> 02:21:15,708
We're almost there.

1531
02:21:16,291 --> 02:21:18,916
Bhairava, go straight at full speed.

1532
02:21:21,625 --> 02:21:23,208
There's nothing ahead, Bhairava.

1533
02:21:23,291 --> 02:21:25,250
All I see is a mountain on my sensors.

1534
02:21:25,333 --> 02:21:27,083
Trust me, Bhairava. Let's go.

1535
02:21:27,333 --> 02:21:28,541
It's dangerous to be out here for long.

1536
02:21:28,958 --> 02:21:31,250
If we crash ahead,
even our parts won't be found.

1537
02:21:31,333 --> 02:21:32,250
Let's go back.

1538
02:21:37,375 --> 02:21:39,166
No more going back.

1539
02:21:55,708 --> 02:21:56,875
Welcome to Shambala.

1540
02:22:01,666 --> 02:22:03,125
Luke, is that you?
And who's this?

1541
02:22:03,291 --> 02:22:04,166
Relax, guys!

1542
02:22:05,333 --> 02:22:06,166
He's Bhairava.

1543
02:22:06,583 --> 02:22:07,458
He's a great fighter.

1544
02:22:07,916 --> 02:22:09,000
He's on our side now.

1545
02:22:09,916 --> 02:22:10,791
Does Veeran know?

1546
02:22:11,041 --> 02:22:12,625
I'm taking him to Veeran now.

1547
02:22:13,083 --> 02:22:14,458
Okay. Follow me.

1548
02:22:15,125 --> 02:22:15,958
What about me?

1549
02:22:16,333 --> 02:22:18,083
I'll finish the formalities
and be right back.

1550
02:22:19,583 --> 02:22:21,000
Take care of the car.

1551
02:22:21,541 --> 02:22:23,000
I fixed it just a while ago.

1552
02:22:27,125 --> 02:22:29,541
That's one massive set-up
centered in the mountains.

1553
02:22:30,166 --> 02:22:32,833
And the Complex has no idea
that you guys are doing so well.

1554
02:22:32,916 --> 02:22:33,750
Come here.

1555
02:22:34,791 --> 02:22:35,708
How's everyone?

1556
02:22:36,791 --> 02:22:37,625
It rained.

1557
02:22:37,750 --> 02:22:39,416
What? Are you serious?

1558
02:22:39,958 --> 02:22:42,166
As Mariam said, the Mother has arrived.

1559
02:22:42,750 --> 02:22:43,625
Where is she?

1560
02:22:44,083 --> 02:22:45,000
She's at the tree.

1561
02:22:45,583 --> 02:22:46,916
It rained, the Mother arrived,

1562
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:48,041
and now you're here as well.

1563
02:22:48,708 --> 02:22:49,708
You see, Bhairava?

1564
02:22:53,958 --> 02:22:54,791
Sorry, kid.

1565
02:23:04,583 --> 02:23:05,625
We need to go.

1566
02:23:06,458 --> 02:23:07,625
It's dangerous to be here.

1567
02:25:39,791 --> 02:25:42,333
I came prepared this time, old man.

1568
02:26:06,125 --> 02:26:07,000
Fire!

1569
02:26:48,583 --> 02:26:50,166
Hello, Shambala!

1570
02:26:51,250 --> 02:26:52,291
I caught you!

1571
02:26:53,208 --> 02:26:54,041
Veeran...

1572
02:27:02,041 --> 02:27:02,875
Come.

1573
02:27:05,833 --> 02:27:06,833
Get out of the way, old man.

1574
02:27:07,458 --> 02:27:08,625
There's no time.

1575
02:27:29,791 --> 02:27:30,666
Bujji!

1576
02:27:36,166 --> 02:27:38,208
Yes! I won!

1577
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:44,750
Oh, no! Force field?

1578
02:28:45,750 --> 02:28:46,583
What do we do now?

1579
02:29:03,625 --> 02:29:05,583
Go, get her.

1580
02:29:13,291 --> 02:29:15,000
Sirius, are you ready?

1581
02:29:17,041 --> 02:29:17,916
For tomorrow.

1582
02:29:29,875 --> 02:29:32,250
The darkness that we've
been fighting this whole time...

1583
02:29:32,500 --> 02:29:34,541
now stands at our doorstep.

1584
02:29:36,958 --> 02:29:37,958
What should we do?

1585
02:29:39,750 --> 02:29:40,958
Should we run away?

1586
02:29:42,916 --> 02:29:45,125
- Or should we fight?
- Let's fight!

1587
02:29:45,208 --> 02:29:47,583
- Let's fight!
- Let's fight!

1588
02:29:59,291 --> 02:30:02,041
- For tomorrow!
- For tomorrow!

1589
02:30:43,708 --> 02:30:44,541
Mom...

1590
02:32:52,875 --> 02:32:54,000
For tomorrow.

1591
02:33:10,833 --> 02:33:12,750
Come on.
We need to get out of here.

1592
02:33:16,291 --> 02:33:18,416
Hurry up. There's no time.

1593
02:33:20,916 --> 02:33:22,500
Help! Help!

1594
02:33:23,125 --> 02:33:25,125
- Help!
- Many people have been left behind.

1595
02:33:25,375 --> 02:33:27,833
Our people will
take care of them. Let's go.

1596
02:33:41,125 --> 02:33:42,041
Go inside.

1597
02:33:42,625 --> 02:33:43,583
What about you, Mariam?

1598
02:33:43,875 --> 02:33:45,666
Go. That's an order.

1599
02:33:51,083 --> 02:33:51,958
Andrew!

1600
02:34:08,875 --> 02:34:11,000
Roger that, Mariam.
All systems check.

1601
02:34:15,416 --> 02:34:16,375
What are you doing?

1602
02:34:16,708 --> 02:34:17,750
Why did you get down?

1603
02:34:18,541 --> 02:34:20,250
Garud One.
Land right now.

1604
02:38:17,583 --> 02:38:19,250
I want to kill you right here, right now.

1605
02:38:20,958 --> 02:38:22,583
But Supreme insisted...

1606
02:38:24,333 --> 02:38:26,583
that he kill you and your
baby with his own hands.

1607
02:38:57,375 --> 02:38:59,000
You called the baby God, right?

1608
02:39:00,375 --> 02:39:02,500
Is there nobody else to save her?

1609
02:40:03,875 --> 02:40:07,083
<i>Oh warrior!</i>

1610
02:40:07,166 --> 02:40:08,458
Blow him to hell.

1611
02:40:09,166 --> 02:40:13,375
<i>Oh warrior!</i>

1612
02:41:03,333 --> 02:41:06,041
<i>Did I take too long,
Son of Acharya?</i>

1613
02:41:06,958 --> 02:41:12,333
<i>Oh warrior!
Brave fighter, come forth!</i>

1614
02:41:12,416 --> 02:41:17,083
<i>Oh warrior!
Brave fighter, come forth!</i>

1615
02:41:41,625 --> 02:41:46,416
<i>Oh warrior!</i>

1616
02:41:46,958 --> 02:41:51,208
<i>Oh warrior!</i>

1617
02:43:10,375 --> 02:43:11,333
Bhairava!

1618
02:43:16,166 --> 02:43:18,541
Hey! You're the woman from the lab.

1619
02:43:23,875 --> 02:43:26,750
Bujji, the old man is trapped.

1620
02:43:29,166 --> 02:43:31,041
Let's run away, Bujji.

1621
02:43:39,625 --> 02:43:41,208
Please don't take me inside the Complex.

1622
02:43:41,916 --> 02:43:43,875
First, let's get out of here, Bhairava.

1623
02:43:44,833 --> 02:43:45,750
Brother!

1624
02:43:45,833 --> 02:43:47,958
Bujji, the old man is coming back.

1625
02:43:58,833 --> 02:43:59,708
Full throttle!

1626
02:44:00,083 --> 02:44:00,958
Bhairava, let's go.

1627
02:44:01,708 --> 02:44:02,583
Hold up, my friend.

1628
02:44:04,916 --> 02:44:05,916
Listen to me!

1629
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:12,000
Don't do it, Bhairava.

1630
02:44:12,250 --> 02:44:13,958
Who knows where we'll land?

1631
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:28,875
Who's that?

1632
02:44:30,583 --> 02:44:31,958
<i>Ashwathama,</i>

1633
02:44:32,041 --> 02:44:35,250
this is the Gaandeev created
by the Creator, Brahma.

1634
02:44:35,791 --> 02:44:37,833
Nobody can fight it.

1635
02:45:27,416 --> 02:45:30,125
Did I take too long,
Son of Acharya?

1636
02:45:30,208 --> 02:45:31,041
No.

1637
02:45:32,291 --> 02:45:34,291
You came at the right time, my friend.

1638
02:45:48,458 --> 02:45:49,583
You see that, Keshava?

1639
02:45:50,666 --> 02:45:52,083
How can he be my equal?

1640
02:45:52,625 --> 02:45:56,083
He could push our chariot back
by only two feet,

1641
02:45:57,083 --> 02:46:00,000
but my weapon pushed
his chariot back by ten feet.

1642
02:46:02,083 --> 02:46:03,125
Listen, Dhanunjaya!

1643
02:46:03,666 --> 02:46:05,875
Your chariot is a blessing
from the God of Fire.

1644
02:46:07,833 --> 02:46:11,125
Guarding it is Lord Hanuman,
as symbolized on the flag.

1645
02:46:11,208 --> 02:46:13,250
<i>You are the son of
Anjani Devi and Lord Pavana</i>

1646
02:46:13,333 --> 02:46:16,125
Riding it is me,
the Master of all three worlds.

1647
02:46:20,166 --> 02:46:23,583
He still managed to
push it back by two feet.

1648
02:46:23,916 --> 02:46:25,291
Think about it, Arjuna.

1649
02:46:25,708 --> 02:46:27,333
The one standing in front of you

1650
02:46:27,583 --> 02:46:29,500
is not an ordinary warrior.

1651
02:46:29,708 --> 02:46:32,125
I see the radiance
of the sun in his eyes.

1652
02:46:33,916 --> 02:46:36,500
In his hand is the Vijaya Bow.

1653
02:46:48,250 --> 02:46:50,708
History will not forget his name.

1654
02:46:54,416 --> 02:46:56,458
The Descendant of the Sun.

1655
02:46:57,000 --> 02:46:57,833
<i>Karn!</i>

1656
02:46:58,583 --> 02:47:03,750
<i>Oh warrior!
Brave fighter, come forth!</i>

1657
02:47:20,125 --> 02:47:21,916
A mistake has been made, Supreme.

1658
02:47:22,375 --> 02:47:25,041
The woman who carried
the formula for 150 days

1659
02:47:25,416 --> 02:47:27,250
has escaped from the labs.

1660
02:47:28,333 --> 02:47:30,250
This is what they extracted from her.

1661
02:47:33,208 --> 02:47:35,041
Just one drop of the serum.

1662
02:47:57,791 --> 02:47:59,125
Something is happening.

1663
02:47:59,875 --> 02:48:02,375
The Gaandeev that nobody can touch...

1664
02:48:03,083 --> 02:48:05,541
The immortal Ashwathama...

1665
02:48:05,708 --> 02:48:07,541
A force beyond everyone's understanding.

1666
02:48:07,875 --> 02:48:08,708
Some...

1667
02:48:09,625 --> 02:48:10,458
Some...

1668
02:48:11,166 --> 02:48:12,333
new power.

1669
02:49:11,500 --> 02:49:13,458
If a single drop
encompasses such power...

1670
02:49:14,250 --> 02:49:15,916
I completely understand now, Supreme.

1671
02:49:16,458 --> 02:49:18,625
I'll get that woman back.

1672
02:49:19,375 --> 02:49:20,208
No.

1673
02:49:21,416 --> 02:49:22,750
I'll go get her myself.

1674
02:49:39,416 --> 02:49:43,916
<i>Jagannatha's chariot wheels
will turn back once more...</i>

1675
02:49:45,625 --> 02:49:50,208
<i>It will bring destruction
with every turn it takes.</i>

1676
02:49:51,875 --> 02:49:55,916
<i>Born of the womb of Mother Earth...</i>

1677
02:49:56,541 --> 02:50:01,541
{\an8}<i>One yuga will end, and another will arise.</i>
