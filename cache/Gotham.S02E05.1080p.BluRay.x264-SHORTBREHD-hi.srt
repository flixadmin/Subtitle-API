322
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:08,565
Biggest job of our lives,
and this happens.

323

CALE: <i>So what do we do?</i>

324
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,902
For sure, we do the job.

325
00:19:12,069 --> 00:19:15,405
How? We're screwed.
Who's our entry man now?

326
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:17,407
Crawling through air vents,
climbing fire escapes.

327
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:19,493
We need a little skinny guy.

328
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,247
You think?

329
00:19:25,249 --> 00:19:27,793
Yo, Bridgy. You just got a promotion.

330
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:29,378
- No.
- Yes.

331
00:19:29,545 --> 00:19:31,380
Please, you know I don't like fire.

332
00:19:31,547 --> 00:19:34,091
You don't like fire?
Fire is our bread and butter.

333
00:19:34,258 --> 00:19:35,592
It's our family business.

334
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:38,095
You don't wanna let down your family,
do you?

335
00:19:38,262 --> 00:19:39,429
You're not my family.

336
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:43,934
What's that? We're not your family?
You got anybody else?

337
00:19:44,101 --> 00:19:46,770
- My mother--
- Your mother was a ho, and she's dead.

338
00:19:46,937 --> 00:19:49,606
Who feeds you?
Who puts a roof above your head, huh?

339
00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:51,942
We do. That's family.

340
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:53,485
I won't do it.

341
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:54,736
Oh. (CHUCKLES)

342
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:57,072
Fine, be like that.

343
00:19:57,239 --> 00:20:00,117
But if you're not family, well,
that changes things around here, though.

344
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:03,245
See, I'm a decent guy.
I would never put family on the street.

345
00:20:03,453 --> 00:20:05,122
But if you're not family,

346
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:08,792
hell, why not make a buck?

347
00:20:09,001 --> 00:20:11,670
Yo, that's a kick-ass idea.

348
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:13,589
So what are you gonna do?

349
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:19,636
Do you wanna be turned out,
or do you wanna be family? Which?

350
00:20:21,597 --> 00:20:22,723
Family.

351
00:20:26,685 --> 00:20:28,979
He wanted me to endorse him for mayor.

352
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:30,647
Wow.

353
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:32,482
What did you say?

354
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:33,817
I said no.

355
00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:36,445
You don't like him?

356
00:20:36,904 --> 00:20:40,908
I do, actually,
but I know better than to let that matter.

357
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:44,161
Endorsing politicians, that's not me.

358
00:20:44,328 --> 00:20:46,163
Still, he asked you.
That's very flattering.

359
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:48,415
You're a respected figure in this town.

360
00:20:51,126 --> 00:20:54,504
The way people look at you,
see you differently.

361
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:56,173
You treat it like it's a burden.

362
00:20:56,757 --> 00:20:59,676
It could be a source of pride,
or happiness even, if you let it.

363

The Waynes forbade the press

492

<i>They renamed streets and buildings.</i>

<i>The remnants of the Dumas family

494
00:30:35,752 --> 00:30:41,716
The Waynes wiped the Dumas
out of our city's history.

495
00:30:42,133 --> 00:30:44,469
Those remnants of the Dumas family,

496
00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:48,139
to what did they change their name?

497

Thank you, Edwige.

That is where penguins thrive.

Uh-huh.

The arsonists moved east to west.

513

If they come out tonight and stick
to pattern, there's one obvious target.

This is a blood feud for Galavan.

He wants revenge against the Waynes.

It's been a long time.

636
00:40:58,124 --> 00:40:59,959
(SIGHS) You look well.

637
00:41:00,584 --> 00:41:01,794
As do you.

638
00:41:03,546 --> 00:41:05,965
You've surrounded yourself with luxury.

639
00:41:06,173 --> 00:41:10,302
I have to play the part, Father,
and as you'll see,

640
00:41:15,641 --> 00:41:17,268
it's paying off.

641
00:41:25,067 --> 00:41:27,069
Still sharp after all these years.

642
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,655
Do you have the Wayne boy?

643
00:41:30,197 --> 00:41:34,827
Not yet. There are some practical matters
that have to be resolved first.

644
00:41:35,035 --> 00:41:40,082
A few pieces to arrange on the board
before the checkmate. But soon.

645
00:41:40,791 --> 00:41:44,503
After almost 200 years, we can be patient.

646
00:41:45,588 --> 00:41:47,673
The day of redemption is at hand.

647
00:41:48,424 --> 00:41:51,343
<i>Our brothers are crossing the ocean
even now.</i>

648
00:41:51,927 --> 00:41:55,306
<i>Warriors like this city has never known.</i>

649
00:41:55,514 --> 00:41:58,767
Gotham will be redeemed in blood.

650
00:42:00,603 --> 00:42:03,606
And Bruce Wayne will die.

651
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:48,692
