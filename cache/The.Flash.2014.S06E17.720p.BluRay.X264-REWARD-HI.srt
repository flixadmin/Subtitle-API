1
00:00:05,048 --> 00:00:07,151
[Dibny] So, we built a machine
powerful enough to big-bang

2
00:00:07,175 --> 00:00:08,510
a new Speed Force into existence,

3
00:00:08,593 --> 00:00:12,555
based solely on the teachings
of history's most evil speedster.

4
00:00:13,682 --> 00:00:15,684
Are we sure we wanna hit this switch?

5
00:00:22,732 --> 00:00:23,732
[sighs]

6
00:00:27,445 --> 00:00:28,445
Do it.

7
00:00:31,574 --> 00:00:34,119
[machine whirring]

8
00:00:59,894 --> 00:01:02,731
[machine beeping rapidly]

9
00:01:02,814 --> 00:01:05,358
- [machine powering down]
- [Barry] Uh, what's happening?

10
00:01:13,575 --> 00:01:14,784
It didn't work.

11
00:01:35,722 --> 00:01:37,682
- [banging at door]
- [Cecile] Guys, you in there?

12
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:41,269
Hey. Sorry to interrupt.

13
00:01:41,394 --> 00:01:45,190
- Oh, um, how did the machine test go?
- Well, it didn't.

14
00:01:45,273 --> 00:01:46,483
That's the problem.

15
00:01:46,566 --> 00:01:48,359
How did Thawne manage to build

16
00:01:48,443 --> 00:01:51,571
a Speed Force machine on his own
without a journal to guide him,

17
00:01:51,654 --> 00:01:55,450
but all the brainpower in S.T.A.R. Labs
can't even get this thing to work?

18
00:01:55,867 --> 00:01:58,369
It's like we built a 12-ton paperweight.

19
00:01:58,995 --> 00:02:00,538
[Cecile] Okay, okay, but, hey, uh,

20
00:02:00,622 --> 00:02:03,458
maybe getting out of here for a minute
might clear your heads.

21
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:07,921
I myself was on my way over to
<i>The Citizen</i> right now. Does anybody...

22
00:02:08,296 --> 00:02:10,507
Barry, wanna come with me?

23
00:02:12,425 --> 00:02:14,552
No. Look, every day
that the machine is off

24
00:02:14,636 --> 00:02:16,471
is another day I can't
protect this city.

25
00:02:16,554 --> 00:02:17,889
I have to keep working.

26
00:02:18,348 --> 00:02:19,348
[groans]

27
00:02:21,184 --> 00:02:22,602
[Cecile] Barry, wait.

28
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,870
Are you sure you don't want to see Iris?

29
00:02:30,276 --> 00:02:32,111
Can I tell her anything for you?

30
00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:35,907
Tell her I miss her.

31
00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:46,251
His speed has been draining nonstop.
Your plan was a success.

32
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:48,169
You've done an amazing job.

33
00:02:50,713 --> 00:02:52,131
Is everything okay?

34
00:02:52,841 --> 00:02:53,841
You seem...

35
00:02:54,801 --> 00:02:55,801
distant.

36
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,053
Sorry, um...

37
00:02:57,971 --> 00:03:00,974
I'd just like to know if you want us
to proceed with the next phase.

38
00:03:01,057 --> 00:03:02,057
[Eva] Yes.

39
00:03:02,517 --> 00:03:04,519
Go join your brother and prepare,

40
00:03:05,186 --> 00:03:09,399
because tonight,
I will finally have my liberation.

41
00:03:10,191 --> 00:03:11,752
- Success is assured.
- Success is assured.

42
00:03:11,776 --> 00:03:12,776
[knocking at door]

43
00:03:15,864 --> 00:03:16,864
[Iris West] Come in.

44
00:03:18,157 --> 00:03:20,451
- Hey, you busy?
- [Kamilla] Hey, what's up?

45
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:21,995
I just wanted to...

46
00:03:29,544 --> 00:03:31,045
You're here about me and Barry?

47
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,130
Yeah.

48
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,552
He's in a really bad place, Iris.

49
00:03:38,511 --> 00:03:41,723
His heart is breaking.
He won't talk to anybody about it.

50
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,576
He promised me after he took Nora
to the future,

51
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,809
that would be the last time

52
00:03:44,893 --> 00:03:47,437
that he made a decision
about our family without me.

53
00:03:47,937 --> 00:03:50,040
But then he took my dad into WITSEC
and didn't even tell me.

54
00:03:50,064 --> 00:03:51,566
I had to find out from Singh.

55
00:03:51,941 --> 00:03:53,610
How do you get over that, Cecile?

56
00:03:53,985 --> 00:03:54,985
Well...

57
00:03:55,904 --> 00:03:57,071
I don't really know, Iris,

58
00:03:57,155 --> 00:04:00,491
but I would think
the first step is wanting to.

59
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:02,619
What do you want?

60
00:04:11,127 --> 00:04:13,755
I... I don't know.

61
00:04:17,717 --> 00:04:20,345
Can you feel what I want?

62
00:04:21,721 --> 00:04:23,014
Can you tell me?

63
00:04:23,723 --> 00:04:26,100
[Cecile's psychic powers trilling]

64
00:04:30,605 --> 00:04:33,608
You feel... sad.

65
00:04:34,692 --> 00:04:37,362
Sad and concerned.

66
00:04:38,404 --> 00:04:40,323
I think what Iris needs right now
is space

67
00:04:40,406 --> 00:04:42,992
to focus on what's really important.

68
00:04:44,494 --> 00:04:46,454
Right, uh...

69
00:04:46,955 --> 00:04:50,875
It's important for me to take care
of myself right now, Cecile.

70
00:04:53,503 --> 00:04:54,963
Okay, yeah, um...

71
00:04:57,715 --> 00:05:00,259
Your husband wanted me to tell you
that he misses you.

72
00:05:12,981 --> 00:05:14,021
- [door thuds]
- [exclaims]

73
00:05:14,357 --> 00:05:15,357
[knocking] Barr?

74
00:05:16,067 --> 00:05:17,753
- Hey.
- There's something blocking the door.

75
00:05:17,777 --> 00:05:18,777
Yeah, um...

76
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:20,214
[Cecile] I thought you were still
at the speed lab.

77
00:05:20,238 --> 00:05:21,238
[Barry] Uh...

78
00:05:21,531 --> 00:05:22,447
[Barry grunts]

79
00:05:22,448 --> 00:05:23,616
- Hey, Barry...
- Hold on.

80
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,411
- Why can't I get inside my own house?
- Sorry. Hold on.

81
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:28,329
- Give me a sec, okay?
- Geez.

82
00:05:28,413 --> 00:05:29,413
[Barry clears throat]

83
00:05:33,001 --> 00:05:34,544
Cecile, I can explain.

84
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,047
What the hell is this?

85
00:05:39,841 --> 00:05:41,342
Iris isn't Iris.

86
00:05:48,099 --> 00:05:49,099
[Barry]
Okay, so then I thought, well,

87
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,370
obviously this can't be
an Iris doppelgänger from another Earth,

88
00:05:51,394 --> 00:05:52,955
because doppelgängers
don't exist anymore,

89
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:54,540
because the multi-verse
doesn't exist anymore,

90
00:05:54,564 --> 00:05:56,816
- because Crisis blew it all up, right?
- Uh-huh.

91
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:58,526
Exactly. So, if that's true,

92
00:05:58,609 --> 00:06:00,629
who else do we know
that could be pretending to be Iris?

93
00:06:00,653 --> 00:06:02,488
- I... But...
- Shapeshifters.

94
00:06:02,697 --> 00:06:04,216
All right, so Everyman
was my first suspect.

95
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,743
And Cisco's reports show
that he is alive, post-Crisis.

96
00:06:06,826 --> 00:06:09,829
Then, I remembered something
that Breacher said about Plastoids,

97
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:10,955
which made me realize...

98
00:06:11,372 --> 00:06:13,583
there could be shapeshifting Martians
on this Earth now.

99
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,502
This... This fake Iris doesn't even
have to be from our planet.

100
00:06:16,586 --> 00:06:17,670
But then, it hit me

101
00:06:17,754 --> 00:06:20,474
that J'onn J'onzz would sense
if there was a Martian hidden among us,

102
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:21,549
so that was a dead end,

103
00:06:21,674 --> 00:06:23,676
but it led me
to my biggest breakthrough yet.

104
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,761
Okay, Cecile.

105
00:06:25,094 --> 00:06:28,890
The night that this all started,
Iris left to investigate a story.

106
00:06:28,973 --> 00:06:32,810
I analyzed her phone's GPS, and it shows
that she went to McCulloch Tech.

107
00:06:34,062 --> 00:06:37,023
Cecile, I think that something happened
to Iris that night.

108
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:40,358
Barry.

109
00:06:40,818 --> 00:06:43,780
All of this, is this the reason
you've been avoiding Iris?

110
00:06:43,863 --> 00:06:46,407
That's not Iris!
Okay, look, I didn't want to...

111
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,535
tell anyone else about this
until I gathered more evidence,

112
00:06:49,619 --> 00:06:51,746
but now you know, so I...

113
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,039
What do you think?

114
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,458
Uh...

115
00:06:56,459 --> 00:07:00,129
What do I think? What do I think?
I think... I think that this sounds...

116
00:07:00,213 --> 00:07:02,215
I know how it sounds,
but look, we've seen crazier.

117
00:07:02,298 --> 00:07:04,068
We've seen crazier.
And look at all the clues.

118
00:07:04,092 --> 00:07:06,385
Okay, I mean, she speaks Italian,
all of a sudden.

119
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:08,304
She smashed a bottle
over some guy's head.

120
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:09,547
She made incredible pancakes.

121
00:07:10,223 --> 00:07:12,183
Cecile, trust me.
Iris can't make pancakes.

122
00:07:12,475 --> 00:07:14,602
All right? But the biggest clue was...

123
00:07:16,104 --> 00:07:17,271
her throwing me out.

124
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:21,692
The real Iris would never
stop fighting for us.

125
00:07:23,653 --> 00:07:25,196
Okay. Okay, uh...

126
00:07:26,322 --> 00:07:30,618
Sweetie, do you think
that maybe, just maybe...

127
00:07:31,619 --> 00:07:33,329
you're feeling a little scared?

128
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:35,957
You know, because your marriage
is going through a rough patch,

129
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:40,753
and maybe what you need to do
is just go see Iris.

130
00:07:41,045 --> 00:07:43,047
That's not Ir... Cecile, look.

131
00:07:43,256 --> 00:07:45,296
Do you know why
my Speed Gauge is still glowing red?

132
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:50,221
It is because the moment
that I stepped out of the loft,

133
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:54,183
I realized Iris, the real Iris, my wife,

134
00:07:54,517 --> 00:07:57,937
she is somewhere else,
probably in danger.

135
00:07:58,187 --> 00:08:00,940
And if that's true,
I need my speed back,

136
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:04,235
my lightning, all my powers,
if I'm gonna save her.

137
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:06,152
[sighs]

138
00:08:06,154 --> 00:08:07,714
It's all I've thought about ever since.

139
00:08:08,156 --> 00:08:11,200
No matter how insane this all sounds...

140
00:08:12,535 --> 00:08:17,915
I know in my heart that the real Iris
is out there somewhere,

141
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:20,543
waiting for me to find her.

142
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:22,670
I won't let her down.

143
00:08:30,845 --> 00:08:32,972
Polar bear's a little on-the-nose,
don't you think?

144
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:34,283
Well, it's not like the stores have

145
00:08:34,307 --> 00:08:36,934
a "get well soon from
dual light-assassin attacks" card.

146
00:08:38,311 --> 00:08:39,227
What'd you bring?

147
00:08:39,228 --> 00:08:40,521
I got a mobile bio-lab,

148
00:08:40,605 --> 00:08:42,940
so she can catch up on her work
while she recovers in bed.

149
00:08:44,734 --> 00:08:46,360
Don't be jealous.
It's a scientist thing.

150
00:08:47,111 --> 00:08:48,779
Come on, snowpoke. It's us.

151
00:08:49,614 --> 00:08:50,698
[ice crackling]

152
00:08:54,744 --> 00:08:55,912
It's ice-cold.

153
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,670
Caitlin.

154
00:09:06,005 --> 00:09:07,465
Help me.

155
00:09:12,595 --> 00:09:14,075
Since when is Caitlin the frosty one?

156
00:09:18,684 --> 00:09:19,685
She's not.

157
00:09:21,854 --> 00:09:23,898
Hang on, Caitlin. We're on the case.

158
00:09:29,237 --> 00:09:32,281
I think I've come up with a new idea
to get us out of this place.

159
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:38,287
[gasps] Stop! What are you doing?

160
00:09:38,454 --> 00:09:39,454
Eva, think about it.

161
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:41,374
This is the only mirror
that you can control,

162
00:09:41,707 --> 00:09:43,709
so there's gotta be something
different about it.

163
00:09:44,085 --> 00:09:48,881
And until we can figure out what that
is, we're just working blind. Move.

164
00:09:49,173 --> 00:09:52,176
So, to examine it, you want to smash it?

165
00:09:52,635 --> 00:09:55,596
Yeah. I mean, we both know
that you can put it back together,

166
00:09:55,846 --> 00:09:57,640
so let's just take this thing down,

167
00:09:57,723 --> 00:10:00,559
dissect it piece-by-piece,
and learn what its secrets are.

168
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:04,480
Fine. You do what you wanna do.

169
00:10:07,316 --> 00:10:08,676
- [sighs]
- I'm gonna go to my lab,

170
00:10:08,776 --> 00:10:11,570
and work on a plan
that would actually help us.

171
00:10:16,284 --> 00:10:17,284
[sighs]

172
00:10:45,521 --> 00:10:47,398
Oh, my God.

173
00:10:50,443 --> 00:10:52,445
[Cecile] Can you, uh, maybe hurry up?

174
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:55,281
You know, when Iris gave me a spare key,
it was to water her plants.

175
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:56,466
It wasn't to hack her computer.

176
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,118
It's not hacking Iris' computer
if it's not really Iris.

177
00:10:59,327 --> 00:11:00,679
What are you even looking for, anyway?

178
00:11:00,703 --> 00:11:03,831
Anything that might be suspicious
from the past few weeks.

179
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,753
- Bingo.
- What'd you find?

180
00:11:09,545 --> 00:11:10,545
This photo.

181
00:11:11,005 --> 00:11:12,506
It was deleted from Kamilla's camera,

182
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:15,009
but not before it was uploaded
to <i>The Citizen's</i> cloud server.

183
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:16,218
Do you see this text?

184
00:11:16,844 --> 00:11:18,471
[Cecile] "Prismatic Filter."

185
00:11:19,472 --> 00:11:20,472
What is that?

186
00:11:21,724 --> 00:11:24,810
It's the science that we're gonna use
to test our imposter's identity.

187
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:27,313
Expose her for good.

188
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,076
That's better. Much more homey.

189
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:42,370
"Closer" is how I'd describe it.

190
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:44,372
Closer to our Mother.

191
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:47,041
It's time for our next move.

192
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:50,294
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

193
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:52,712
Are you?

194
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:55,799
Yes.

195
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:58,636
All that matters is Eva's will.

196
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:01,972
We follow orders and assure her success.

197
00:12:02,348 --> 00:12:03,349
That's all I want.

198
00:12:04,058 --> 00:12:05,309
[Captain] We need to focus.

199
00:12:05,643 --> 00:12:08,479
There's still one item Mother needs
to obtain for her liberation.

[Iris West] Hey, I saw your text.

202
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,874
I got here as fast as I could.
What's the emergency?

203
00:12:32,336 --> 00:12:34,046
You are, apparently.

[gauntlet beeping]

00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,760
What's going on?

206
00:12:41,554 --> 00:12:43,931
You're not Iris. That's what.

207
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:47,601
And you're not leaving here
until you tell us who or what you are.

208

[scoffs]

209
00:12:52,314 --> 00:12:53,983
What the hell are you talking about?

210
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:58,612
And why are you pointing
that gauntlet at me?

211
00:13:03,451 --> 00:13:05,953
This photo was taken on
Kamilla's camera.

212
00:13:06,537 --> 00:13:08,330
You see the prismatic fragmentation?

213
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,041
Only your image is affected.

214
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:15,546
I think that the camera's filter
is revealing a dimensional shift,

215
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:18,674
showing us things in the picture
from another dimension.

216
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:21,135
Things that don't belong in ours.

217
00:13:26,432 --> 00:13:28,058
Cecile, you actually believe this?

218
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:32,813
You seemed off in your office earlier,
and that photo...

219
00:13:32,897 --> 00:13:35,608
That could have been anything!
A glitch in the camera tech.

220
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:37,276
Guys, this is insane.

221
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:43,782
This Prismatic Scanner is just a more
powerful version of the camera's filter.

222
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:47,244
If I'm wrong,
and you are from this dimension,

223
00:13:47,328 --> 00:13:50,498
then when the prismatic wave hits you,
you'll look completely normal.

224
00:13:51,624 --> 00:13:55,544
But if I'm right,
you're gonna look just like that photo.

225
00:13:57,713 --> 00:14:00,049
And you're gonna tell us
where the real Iris is.

226
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:04,094
Barry, how could you do this?

319
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:41,617
Since we don't have
any ionized conductive wiring,

320
00:20:41,867 --> 00:20:43,577
you'll have to be the jumper cables.

321
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:45,161
Got it.

322
00:20:46,455 --> 00:20:47,455
Okay.

323
00:20:57,007 --> 00:20:59,718
[yelling]

324
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:02,638
[gibbering]

325
00:21:05,557 --> 00:21:06,557
[groans]

326
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:11,437
[gasps]

327
00:21:12,022 --> 00:21:13,523
Ralph, are you all right?

328
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:15,691
Is she good?

329
00:21:19,321 --> 00:21:22,532
Cisco, is she okay? Did it work?

330
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:26,410
[gasps]

331
00:21:27,037 --> 00:21:28,037
Ah...

332
00:21:30,248 --> 00:21:31,458
Oh, thank Elsa.

333
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:34,877
Welcome back.

334
00:21:35,671 --> 00:21:36,671
Thanks.

335
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:38,358
[Cisco] You scared us for
a minute, there.

336
00:21:38,382 --> 00:21:39,382
Yeah.

337
00:21:39,883 --> 00:21:41,083
Can you tell us what happened?

338
00:21:41,176 --> 00:21:42,719
[Caitlin] I was home alone,

339
00:21:42,886 --> 00:21:45,806
and the wound from the light bullet
was getting worse.

340
00:21:46,014 --> 00:21:47,825
I'm sure your run-in
with Sunshine didn't help.

341
00:21:47,849 --> 00:21:51,561
Yeah. So I tried to ice-heal it,
and that's when the wound ruptured.

342
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:54,690
It must have been my immune system's
way of protecting me.

343
00:21:57,317 --> 00:22:00,070
- Guys, I need help.
- You just tell us what you need.

344
00:22:00,654 --> 00:22:06,034
I mean, who do we know who can help
with a light... ice wound?

345
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,578
There's only one person we can call.

346
00:22:09,663 --> 00:22:10,914
My mother.

347
00:22:16,211 --> 00:22:17,337
Here she comes.

348
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,200
Everything went according to plan?

349
00:22:21,258 --> 00:22:24,344
Yeah. Yeah, we're fine.
Everything went as planned.

350
00:22:26,471 --> 00:22:27,657
You guys go to the rendezvous.

351
00:22:27,681 --> 00:22:29,307
I'll handle this
and I'll meet you there.

352
00:22:33,562 --> 00:22:36,189
[door opens and closes]

353
00:22:39,651 --> 00:22:42,654
I've been watching Barry Allen.
He's planning on exposing you.

354
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,366
- Tell me what to do.
- Go. Meet him.

355
00:22:46,992 --> 00:22:48,285
Leave the rest to me.

356
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:51,621
You're not Iris.

357
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:55,375
And you're not leaving here
until you tell us who or what you are.

358
00:23:01,131 --> 00:23:02,591
Now, let's get what we came for.

359
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:04,652
One of the benefits
of being Chief of Police

360
00:23:04,676 --> 00:23:06,156
is I can request prisoner interviews.

361
00:23:06,553 --> 00:23:07,804
Even for press.

362
00:23:39,544 --> 00:23:43,632
Well, if it isn't Kamilla Hwang,
Chief Singh...

363
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:48,220
and Iris West-Allen.

364
00:23:49,471 --> 00:23:50,931
To what do I owe the honor?

365
00:23:51,014 --> 00:23:52,933
If you help us,
we can get you out of there.

366
00:23:53,308 --> 00:23:55,477
And why would I trust
the wife of the Flash?

367
00:23:55,727 --> 00:23:58,897
Because I'm not Iris West-Allen.
I'm a reflection of her.

368
00:23:59,189 --> 00:24:00,982
We're all reflections.

369
00:24:01,066 --> 00:24:05,028
Faster, stronger than our human
counterparts whose faces we share.

370
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:07,948
And our only will
is to serve our Mother.

371
00:24:14,579 --> 00:24:18,125
The real Iris would never
offer to release me.

372
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:20,127
Tell me more about your Mother.

373
00:24:20,585 --> 00:24:22,295
Eva McCulloch. She was the sci...

374
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:25,674
I am a scientist.
I know who Eva McCulloch is.

375
00:24:26,216 --> 00:24:27,717
But she disappeared years ago.

376
00:24:27,843 --> 00:24:31,471
She's been trapped in another dimension,
a mirror one,

377
00:24:31,972 --> 00:24:33,473
and she needs something from you.

378
00:24:34,015 --> 00:24:37,102
You need my blood. How grand.

379
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:41,523
Even in here, fate continues to cast me
in the role of savior.

380
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:42,941
We just need one drop.

381
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:45,819
But you need to decide now.

382
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:53,785
I accept.

383
00:24:53,869 --> 00:24:56,204
Release me, and you shall indeed
have my lifeblood.

384
00:24:56,872 --> 00:25:00,667
However, this is no crude
meta-cell in Iron Heights.

385
00:25:01,084 --> 00:25:02,502
How do you propose to disrupt

386
00:25:02,586 --> 00:25:06,464
a bio-degenerative containment matrix
with triplicate backup protocols?

387
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:07,716
Mother has a theory.

388
00:25:08,884 --> 00:25:10,135
I am the answer.

389
00:25:11,428 --> 00:25:12,428
Wait.

390
00:25:15,348 --> 00:25:16,349
You'll die.

391
00:25:19,144 --> 00:25:20,353
Then it is Eva's will.

392
00:25:24,232 --> 00:25:25,232
[sighs]

393
00:25:36,494 --> 00:25:37,537
[alarm blaring]

394
00:25:37,621 --> 00:25:41,041
Code zero. Facility-wide power failure,
all levels. Check the cells.

395
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:44,211
We have 60 seconds
until the guards arrive...

396
00:25:45,462 --> 00:25:47,464
[both gasping]

397
00:25:53,678 --> 00:25:55,722
[screaming]

00:26:02,062 --> 00:26:04,189

[gasping]

400
00:26:09,027 --> 00:26:11,071
You're almost human...

401
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:14,074
Maybe something more.

402
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:17,244
You follow your Master Eva's will,

403
00:26:18,536 --> 00:26:21,665
but I see hesitation in your eyes.

404
00:26:22,165 --> 00:26:25,126
You have a modicum of will.

405
00:26:26,127 --> 00:26:28,505
- Are you planning to trick me?
- [gasps]

406
00:26:28,588 --> 00:26:29,756
Tell me now!

407
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:33,843
- What do you want?
- [gasps]

408
00:26:33,927 --> 00:26:36,179
- Only Eva's will.
- Lies!

409
00:26:37,222 --> 00:26:38,265
Last chance.

410
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,142
What do you want?

411
00:26:41,226 --> 00:26:43,520
[gasping]

412
00:26:43,603 --> 00:26:45,397
To be alive.

413
00:26:46,982 --> 00:26:47,982
[gasps]

414
00:26:47,983 --> 00:26:48,983
[coughs]

415
00:26:49,693 --> 00:26:51,319
And you're worthy of it.

416
00:26:51,861 --> 00:26:53,613
[panting, coughing]

417
00:27:01,037 --> 00:27:02,037
[alarm stops]

418
00:27:02,038 --> 00:27:05,208
[automated voice] <i>Power restored.
Cell containment re-initialized.</i>

419
00:27:05,292 --> 00:27:06,532
[Iris West] What are you doing?

420
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:09,269
We had a plan. Don't you want to escape?

421
00:27:10,422 --> 00:27:14,718
There are walls beyond these walls.
I was never gonna just walk out of here.

422
00:27:16,011 --> 00:27:18,930
But there's more than one way
for me to be free.

423
00:27:19,764 --> 00:27:23,059
Let's just call this... the long game.

424
00:27:25,437 --> 00:27:28,356
[blood squelching]

425
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:39,491
[Captain] Now, go.

426
00:27:39,784 --> 00:27:42,829
I'll stay here and cover our tracks.
Now.

427
00:27:48,168 --> 00:27:50,462
Run, Iris. Run!

428
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,440
Cecile?

429
00:28:11,441 --> 00:28:13,276
I don't have all the facts...

430
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,000
and the ones I do have tell me
that you're not who you say you are.

431
00:28:19,032 --> 00:28:22,327
But you are Barry.
I know it in my heart.

432
00:28:24,913 --> 00:28:26,956
And I'm willing to bet my life on it.

433
00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:30,001
Now go get Iris back.

434
00:28:37,008 --> 00:28:37,926
[Eva] Good work.

435
00:28:37,927 --> 00:28:40,261
You'll apply Ramsey's blood
on your side of the mirror.

436
00:28:40,345 --> 00:28:43,723
Once it is fully absorbed,
I will activate the R-CEM on my side.

437
00:28:43,973 --> 00:28:46,601
Together, they will reconfigure
the molecular stability

438
00:28:46,684 --> 00:28:49,979
of the dimensional barrier
that burns organic matter,

439
00:28:50,063 --> 00:28:52,399
creating a safe passageway
between the two worlds.

440
00:28:53,108 --> 00:28:56,736
Next time I speak to you,
I will be standing right next to you...

441
00:28:58,905 --> 00:29:01,449
- liberated.
- Success is assured.

442
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:07,372
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

443
00:29:11,376 --> 00:29:12,544
Where's my wife?

444
00:29:19,384 --> 00:29:21,803
I'll ask you one more time.
Where's my wife?

445
00:29:25,432 --> 00:29:26,432
What are you doing?

446
00:29:30,937 --> 00:29:31,937
[grunting]

447
00:29:34,441 --> 00:29:35,441
[Eva sighs]

448
00:29:36,317 --> 00:29:39,863
I saw everything.
You targeted me from the very beginning.

449
00:29:39,946 --> 00:29:42,240
You suffered a fraction of my pain.

450
00:29:42,991 --> 00:29:46,453
But in just a few, I will be liberated.

451
00:29:46,995 --> 00:29:50,373
Barry is gonna stop you. We both will.

452
00:29:52,667 --> 00:29:55,086
I used to think my love
gives me strength, too.

453
00:29:55,712 --> 00:29:57,464
The mirror showed me the truth.

454
00:29:58,089 --> 00:29:59,632
Let me do the same for you.

455
00:30:03,803 --> 00:30:05,680
[grunting]

456
00:30:27,035 --> 00:30:29,454
She says you're always
gonna be in her way...

457
00:30:30,246 --> 00:30:31,664
and now you're too slow to stop me.

458
00:30:31,748 --> 00:30:34,542
Whose way? Who is making you do this?

459
00:30:57,482 --> 00:30:58,482
[Barry yells]

460
00:31:09,827 --> 00:31:11,663
You should really
mind your surroundings.

461

Where's my wife?

468
00:32:00,086 --> 00:32:01,879
She's all you can think about, huh?

469
00:32:03,715 --> 00:32:06,342
- [groans]
- What do you think about me, Barry?

470
00:32:07,719 --> 00:32:09,846
All those days...

471
00:32:10,972 --> 00:32:12,181
weeks.

472
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:14,559
It wasn't her, it was me.

00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,687
Enjoying meals together.

474
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,150
Talking about our day.

475
00:32:25,653 --> 00:32:28,239
- Sharing your bed.
- [groans] Shut up.

[grunts]

478
00:32:33,244 --> 00:32:34,871
I am going to kill you.

479
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:39,500
Unlikely. I have been working
on this plan for half a decade.

480
00:32:39,751 --> 00:32:41,794
This is my creation.

481
00:32:42,003 --> 00:32:45,715
She is me and I am her.
What she feels, I feel...

482
00:32:45,798 --> 00:32:47,634
and we cannot lose.

483
00:32:53,306 --> 00:32:55,391
Do they feel what you feel for Carver?

484
00:32:56,893 --> 00:32:57,893
What?

485
00:32:58,811 --> 00:33:00,021
Do they still love him?

486
00:33:00,104 --> 00:33:03,149
I don't love my husband.
I want to end him.

487
00:33:03,274 --> 00:33:05,693
Then why do you still call him
your husband?

488
00:33:05,902 --> 00:33:08,655
You are just as blinded
as you were before,

489
00:33:08,821 --> 00:33:11,699
and he is going to trick you
in the exact same way.

490
00:33:11,866 --> 00:33:14,035
- Stop talking.
- Because you still love him.

491
00:33:14,118 --> 00:33:15,203
[yells] No, I don't!

492
00:33:16,496 --> 00:33:18,581
- [high-pitched trilling]
- [groaning]

493
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,136
Your brilliant mind couldn't figure out
that he didn't care about you.

494
00:33:32,303 --> 00:33:33,221
Shut up!

495
00:33:33,222 --> 00:33:35,890
[groaning]

496
00:33:38,685 --> 00:33:42,021
How long did you sit here, Eva,
pining for rescue...

497
00:33:42,105 --> 00:33:44,440
before you realized
that you had been abandoned?

498
00:33:44,607 --> 00:33:49,070
I hate him! I want him to suffer!
Suffer! Suffer!

499
00:33:49,904 --> 00:33:52,198
Suffer! Suffer!

500
00:33:52,573 --> 00:33:53,950
Suffer!

501
00:33:54,283 --> 00:33:56,411
[Eva] Suffer! Suffer!

502
00:33:57,537 --> 00:33:58,537
Iris?

503
00:34:00,081 --> 00:34:02,417
[Eva] Suffer! Suffer! Suffer!

504
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:03,626
[Iris West] Suffer!

505
00:34:04,544 --> 00:34:05,670
[gasping] Suffer.

506
00:34:05,753 --> 00:34:07,213
[breathing heavily]

507
00:34:08,005 --> 00:34:09,005
[Barry] Iris.

508
00:34:09,966 --> 00:34:10,882
[groans]

509
00:34:10,883 --> 00:34:13,721
I won't fight you.
I won't fight you anymore.

510
00:34:14,554 --> 00:34:15,930
[gasps]

511
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:18,015
You were made from Iris.

512
00:34:21,686 --> 00:34:23,604
Part of her heart is inside you.

513
00:34:24,063 --> 00:34:25,565
- [grunting]
- I've seen you be kind.

514
00:34:25,648 --> 00:34:27,108
I've seen you laugh.

515
00:34:28,359 --> 00:34:30,111
I know that wasn't all a lie.

516
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,906
[gasping]

517
00:34:34,991 --> 00:34:36,617
You can be more than this.

518
00:34:40,121 --> 00:34:41,247
Not Iris...

519
00:34:42,915 --> 00:34:43,915
Yourself.

520
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,588
You have to want it.

521
00:34:54,969 --> 00:34:55,969
No.

522
00:34:58,014 --> 00:34:59,557
You have to choose it.

523
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,600
[gasping]

524
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:08,399
I choose me.

525
00:35:21,662 --> 00:35:22,997
[Iris West] Go find Iris.

526
00:35:24,373 --> 00:35:26,292
[gasps] Go find her, Barry.

527
00:35:28,002 --> 00:35:29,002
Go save Iris.

528
00:35:31,339 --> 00:35:32,339
Go.

529
00:35:34,717 --> 00:35:36,844
[yells]

530
00:35:38,387 --> 00:35:39,639
[groans]

531
00:35:39,722 --> 00:35:41,057
Hey...

532
00:35:47,355 --> 00:35:48,355
[sighs]

533
00:35:53,152 --> 00:35:54,152
Barry.

534
00:35:56,447 --> 00:35:57,740
I feel alive.

535
00:36:04,622 --> 00:36:06,082
I feel alive.

536
00:36:13,256 --> 00:36:15,424
[Barry gasps]

537
00:36:39,907 --> 00:36:41,909
Look what you made me do.

538
00:36:56,173 --> 00:36:57,675
[groans]

539
00:36:57,758 --> 00:36:59,176
No! I'm sorry!

540
00:37:01,387 --> 00:37:03,681
This didn't have to be like this, Flash.

541
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,184
You don't know what it's like in there.

542
00:37:07,435 --> 00:37:08,895
I had to get out.

543
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:10,061
Iris.

544
00:37:11,147 --> 00:37:12,063
Where...

545
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:13,274
Where is she?

546
00:37:13,816 --> 00:37:15,735
[Eva] She's still in the world
I left behind.

547
00:37:16,193 --> 00:37:18,029
Along with the rest
of my insurance policy,

548
00:37:18,112 --> 00:37:20,781
Chief Singh and your friend, Kamilla.

549
00:37:21,908 --> 00:37:24,911
They're safe. How long is up to you.

550
00:37:26,704 --> 00:37:28,664
So, what...

551
00:37:30,124 --> 00:37:31,334
now you're gonna kill me?

552
00:37:34,253 --> 00:37:35,755
There's no need for that.

553
00:37:37,381 --> 00:37:38,633
You're wounded.

554
00:37:39,967 --> 00:37:41,552
You lost your speed...

555
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:44,555
and your healing
is not what it used to be.

556
00:37:45,723 --> 00:37:47,850
You're not much of a threat, are you?

557
00:37:50,895 --> 00:37:55,483
You just stay out of my way, Flash,
and I'll stay out of yours.

558
00:37:55,942 --> 00:37:57,068
[grunting]

559
00:37:57,818 --> 00:38:00,571
I have unfinished business
to attend to...

560
00:38:05,242 --> 00:38:08,955
and a whole world to liberate.

561
00:38:11,248 --> 00:38:13,000
[gasping]

562
00:38:32,645 --> 00:38:34,605
[gasping]

563
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:38,943
[groans]

564
00:38:39,026 --> 00:38:41,445
[breathing heavily]

565
00:38:42,655 --> 00:38:43,864
[sighs] Thank God.

566
00:39:00,506 --> 00:39:01,506
[grunts]

567
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:37,501
Iris, I...

568
00:39:40,963 --> 00:39:43,632
I don't know if it's crazy to think
that you can hear me.

569
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:48,888
I guess right now,
I just need to believe it.

570
00:39:56,353 --> 00:39:57,980
I miss you...

571
00:40:00,441 --> 00:40:01,734
so much.

572
00:40:29,512 --> 00:40:33,057
I know you probably can't hear me,
Barry, but...

573
00:40:35,976 --> 00:40:38,979
being away from you
hurts more and more every day.

574
00:40:44,276 --> 00:40:45,361
But I still have hope,

575
00:40:45,444 --> 00:40:49,949
because I know that you are out there,
fighting to get me back home.

576
00:40:52,034 --> 00:40:53,327
If you can hear me...

577
00:40:57,581 --> 00:40:59,875
I guess I just need you to know that...

578
00:41:01,919 --> 00:41:03,170
I love you.

579
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,552
And that love is constant.

580
00:41:11,011 --> 00:41:12,346
Across dimensions...

581
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,891
Across time.

582
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:21,105
To the end of the world and back.

583
00:41:24,233 --> 00:41:25,693
And if I know you...

584
00:41:27,903 --> 00:41:31,031
I know you aren't just fighting
to find your own way home.

585
00:41:32,491 --> 00:41:34,577
And I'm gonna find Kamilla,

586
00:41:35,828 --> 00:41:37,288
and I'm gonna find Singh.

587
00:41:40,666 --> 00:41:42,042
But most of all...

588
00:41:43,419 --> 00:41:44,628
I'm gonna get you back.

589
00:41:44,712 --> 00:41:46,630
I'm gonna find my way back to you.
