1
00:00:01,119 --> 00:00:02,929
My name is Eobard Thawne.

2
00:00:02,932 --> 00:00:04,406
With the help of Damien Darhk,

3
00:00:04,409 --> 00:00:05,367
Malcolm Merlyn,

4
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:06,869
Leonard Snart, and Mick Rory,

5
00:00:06,872 --> 00:00:08,812
I've obtained the Spear of Destiny...

6
00:00:08,815 --> 00:00:10,536
An ancient artifact with the power

7
00:00:10,538 --> 00:00:14,273
to rewrite reality itself, and we have.

8
00:00:14,275 --> 00:00:16,495
It's a brave new world.

9
00:01:01,089 --> 00:01:02,355
Aah!

10
00:01:17,572 --> 00:01:18,604
Whoops!

11
00:01:27,515 --> 00:01:29,182
The Mayor would like a word,

12
00:01:29,184 --> 00:01:31,284
Miss Smoak.

13
00:01:31,286 --> 00:01:33,085
Then maybe he should've
come down here himself

14
00:01:33,087 --> 00:01:35,478
instead of sending the bimbo brigade.

15
00:01:35,481 --> 00:01:36,956
Rude!

16
00:01:37,892 --> 00:01:39,859
Uhh!

17
00:01:41,162 --> 00:01:42,862
Well done, ladies.

18
00:01:42,864 --> 00:01:45,765
Star City owes you a debt of gratitude.

19
00:01:45,767 --> 00:01:47,834
Just doing our job, Mr. Mayor.

20
00:01:47,836 --> 00:01:51,804
Yes, but you do it so well,
and with such... style.

21
00:01:51,806 --> 00:01:56,175
And you've done a bang-up job
dealing with my... pest problem,

22
00:01:56,177 --> 00:01:58,077
though that term may
be giving you vigilantes

23
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,780
a little too much credit.

24
00:02:00,782 --> 00:02:02,682
Even a cockroach knows when to pack up

25
00:02:02,684 --> 00:02:04,283
and head out of Dodge.

26
00:02:04,285 --> 00:02:08,354
Star City is my home. I
will never stop fighting.

27
00:02:08,356 --> 00:02:10,156
Sure you will.

28
00:02:10,158 --> 00:02:11,390
Kill her.

29
00:02:14,729 --> 00:02:16,562
Hmm.

30
00:02:16,564 --> 00:02:17,730
Get rid of that.

31
00:02:17,732 --> 00:02:21,367
Oh, but I will take this mask...

32
00:02:21,369 --> 00:02:24,570
so I can add it to my collection.

33
00:02:28,177 --> 00:02:33,188
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

34
00:02:34,716 --> 00:02:36,616
No, I will not take a seat

35
00:02:36,618 --> 00:02:38,351
and wait for him to have an opening.

36
00:02:38,353 --> 00:02:40,987
He can make time for me
now. Can't you, Eobard?

37
00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:42,622
I'm so sorry, Mr. Thawne.

38
00:02:42,624 --> 00:02:44,390
He insisted.

39
00:02:49,597 --> 00:02:52,331
I see your friend is
still putting up a fight.

40
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:56,469
He'll give up. All caged
animals do eventually.

41
00:02:58,806 --> 00:03:01,540
Now, tell me why you've flown
all the way out here again.

42
00:03:01,542 --> 00:03:04,277
You keep ignoring my
requests for a meeting.

43
00:03:04,279 --> 00:03:06,946
Because there's no reason for one.

44
00:03:06,948 --> 00:03:08,814
Our partnership has ended.

45
00:03:08,816 --> 00:03:10,150
You got what you wanted.

46
00:03:10,153 --> 00:03:13,619
Your wife and your son are
both alive and in good spirits.

47
00:03:13,621 --> 00:03:15,688
Your daughter Thea adores you.

48
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:19,125
Nyssa al Ghul is trapped in
a miserable, closeted life

49
00:03:19,127 --> 00:03:21,460
in the middle of Ohio, and hey,

50
00:03:21,462 --> 00:03:23,596
you can even clap again.

51
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:25,131
What more could you possibly want?

52
00:03:25,133 --> 00:03:27,199
How about the Spear of Destiny?

53
00:03:27,201 --> 00:03:28,868
There are still some
things in this world

54
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,184
that I would like to see change.

55
00:03:30,187 --> 00:03:31,971
How many times do I have
to tell you this, Malcolm?

56
00:03:31,973 --> 00:03:34,373
The Spear is safest in my hands.

57
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:37,176
Besides, I'm the only one
who knows how to use it.

58
00:03:37,178 --> 00:03:40,279
That's because you destroyed
the Kalabros Manuscript.

59
00:03:40,281 --> 00:03:41,547
Well, it's not my fault

60
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:43,549
you don't retain information like I do.

61
00:03:43,551 --> 00:03:45,751
Speedster brains are handy that way.

62
00:03:46,738 --> 00:03:48,305
Mr. Jackson is here to see you.

63
00:03:49,557 --> 00:03:50,923
Send him in.

64
00:03:50,925 --> 00:03:52,992
Good morning, Mr. Thawne.

65
00:03:52,994 --> 00:03:55,895
Jefferson.

66
00:03:55,897 --> 00:03:57,930
How are things down at the lab?

67
00:03:57,932 --> 00:04:00,099
There was a minor setback,

68
00:04:00,101 --> 00:04:03,135
but the situation is under control.

69
00:04:03,137 --> 00:04:05,137
You promised me results.

70
00:04:05,139 --> 00:04:07,406
And you will have them.

71
00:04:07,408 --> 00:04:10,176
I just need to motivate
my employee a little more.

72
00:04:11,846 --> 00:04:15,047
But another test will be
up and running this evening.

73
00:04:15,049 --> 00:04:18,818
I hope so, for his sake...

74
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,787
and yours.

75
00:04:21,789 --> 00:04:23,689
Yes.

76
00:04:25,426 --> 00:04:27,226
I don't know why

77
00:04:27,228 --> 00:04:29,595
you and Damien insist on
toying with the Legends.

78
00:04:29,597 --> 00:04:32,365
It's sloppy. They should
be wiped from existence.

79
00:04:32,367 --> 00:04:34,467
I prefer this arrangement.

80
00:04:34,469 --> 00:04:36,469
I believe it's called "poetic justice."

81
00:04:36,471 --> 00:04:39,438
And, uh, what is this
project you're working on?

82
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,508
I'm a man of science, Malcolm.

83
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:46,379
I'm compelled to innovate,
invent, and inspire.

84
00:04:46,381 --> 00:04:49,982
A genius brain needs a genius challenge.

85
00:04:49,984 --> 00:04:53,219
Now go. Enjoy your
family, spend your wealth.

86
00:04:53,221 --> 00:04:55,721
The world is as it should be.

87
00:04:55,723 --> 00:04:58,057
Be satisfied with your spoils.

88
00:04:58,059 --> 00:05:01,927
The others are having
the time of their lives.

89
00:05:05,752 --> 00:05:07,551
Stop! Hold it right there!

90
00:05:09,037 --> 00:05:11,904
Cool it, Mick. We already
got what we came for.

91
00:05:11,906 --> 00:05:13,973
Just heating things up.

92
00:05:13,975 --> 00:05:16,342
Don't move! Both of you on the ground!

93
00:05:16,344 --> 00:05:18,844
Mr. Snart. Sorry, sir.

94
00:05:18,846 --> 00:05:21,080
We didn't realize it was you.

95
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,516
Carry on.

96
00:05:26,087 --> 00:05:29,522
What the hell's going
on? No roasting pigs?

97
00:05:29,524 --> 00:05:32,326
No need. We're home free, buddy.

98
00:05:32,329 --> 00:05:34,060
It's good to be the king.

99
00:05:34,062 --> 00:05:36,228
No getaway, no chase?

100
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:38,731
You want a chase, I can arrange a chase.

101
00:05:38,733 --> 00:05:40,366
Even get us tossed in Iron Heights,

102
00:05:40,368 --> 00:05:42,668
and we can plan an escape
just like old times.

103
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,303
- How does that sound?
- Boring!

104
00:05:44,305 --> 00:05:46,205
Well, we could hit up
the Central City Bank.

105
00:05:46,207 --> 00:05:49,075
They've got a fancy new vault
I've been dying to crack.

106
00:05:49,077 --> 00:05:50,543
What's the point?

107
00:05:50,545 --> 00:05:52,478
You own the bank and half the city.

108
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,680
You mean we own half the city, Mick.

109
00:05:54,682 --> 00:05:57,049
We're partners, remember?

110
00:05:57,051 --> 00:05:58,317
Mm.

111
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,986
Seems our next score will have to wait.

112
00:06:00,988 --> 00:06:03,089
Thawne is...

113
00:06:03,091 --> 00:06:04,730
summoning us.

114
00:06:04,733 --> 00:06:06,725
Since when do we get summoned?

115
00:06:06,727 --> 00:06:08,661
Since the man agreed not to erase

116
00:06:08,663 --> 00:06:11,363
you and your friends from existence.

117
00:06:17,805 --> 00:06:21,574
Gideon, I've finally
perfected my fondant bows.

118
00:06:27,548 --> 00:06:28,881
What do you think?

119
00:06:28,883 --> 00:06:30,516
Your technique has vastly improved

120
00:06:30,518 --> 00:06:32,852
over the last year,
Captain. These cakes are

121
00:06:32,854 --> 00:06:34,787
so much more creative
than your biscuits.

122
00:06:34,789 --> 00:06:36,689
Now, credit where credit is due, Gideon.

123
00:06:36,691 --> 00:06:39,492
Your idea of adding more gelatin
to the mixture was pivotal.

124
00:06:39,494 --> 00:06:42,495
Well done. The best one
yet, in my humble opinion.

125
00:06:42,497 --> 00:06:44,330
It's a shame that you're

126
00:06:44,332 --> 00:06:45,824
the only one here to appreciate it.

127
00:06:45,827 --> 00:06:49,101
I'm sure your team would
be just as impressed.

128
00:06:49,103 --> 00:06:51,036
Assuming that they're all still alive.

129
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:52,905
Perhaps you should resume your efforts

130
00:06:52,907 --> 00:06:54,140
to send a message out.

131
00:06:54,142 --> 00:06:55,741
What's the point, Gideon?

132
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,676
The Legion have the Spear of Destiny!

133
00:06:57,678 --> 00:06:59,311
They're like gods now!

134
00:06:59,313 --> 00:07:02,915
There's no point in fighting.

135
00:07:02,917 --> 00:07:05,184
Not anymore.

136
00:07:18,733 --> 00:07:20,799
Stein!

137
00:07:22,403 --> 00:07:23,584
Yes, Mr. Jackson?

138
00:07:23,587 --> 00:07:28,073
What's this I hear about
you taking tomorrow off?

139
00:07:28,075 --> 00:07:30,776
It's Saturday, sir, and
it's my daughter's birthday.

140
00:07:30,778 --> 00:07:34,947
Oh. Well, of course. Take the day off.

141
00:07:34,949 --> 00:07:38,651
In fact, why don't you
take the whole week off?

142
00:07:38,653 --> 00:07:40,052
Really?

143
00:07:40,054 --> 00:07:41,466
Of course.

144
00:07:41,469 --> 00:07:45,724
I mean, the project's ready
for Mr. Thawne to use, correct?

145
00:07:45,726 --> 00:07:48,760
- Well, in fact...
- In fact, old man,

146
00:07:48,763 --> 00:07:50,461
you will not be leaving this building

147
00:07:50,464 --> 00:07:52,298
until Mr. Thawne sees results.

148
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,533
I-I have been working
nonstop for the past month.

149
00:07:54,535 --> 00:07:56,735
I haven't seen my wife
and daughter in weeks.

150
00:07:58,272 --> 00:08:00,639
You want to see your family?

151
00:08:00,641 --> 00:08:03,842
Then you will get that reactor
working by tomorrow night.

152
00:08:03,844 --> 00:08:05,578
It's impossible.
There's too much data...

153
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,446
Get it working!

154
00:08:07,448 --> 00:08:11,350
Or you will never see that
precious family of yours again.

155
00:08:13,264 --> 00:08:16,532
Somebody clean this place
up! It's a damn mess.

156
00:08:23,464 --> 00:08:25,698
I'm so sorry, may I help you with that?

157
00:08:28,703 --> 00:08:31,870
Oh. No worries, man. I got it.

158
00:08:34,942 --> 00:08:37,343
Yes, Mr. President,
you know I'll be there.

159
00:08:37,345 --> 00:08:39,278
You know I love receiving medals.

160
00:08:40,715 --> 00:08:43,015
And then, uh, golf on Sunday.

161
00:08:43,017 --> 00:08:45,184
And dinner at your hotel after?

162
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:49,221
All right, all right, best to Mel.

163
00:08:49,223 --> 00:08:50,456
Bye-bye.

164
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:53,025
I am so sorry. I had to take that.

165
00:08:53,027 --> 00:08:54,593
There's only so many times you can tell

166
00:08:54,595 --> 00:08:55,993
the President of the United States

167
00:08:55,996 --> 00:08:57,204
that you'll call him back.

168
00:08:57,207 --> 00:08:59,231
- You want to get to the point?
- Yes.

169
00:08:59,233 --> 00:09:04,136
I brought you here to
discuss a... sensitive matter,

170
00:09:04,138 --> 00:09:06,939
and it goes by the
name of Malcolm Merlyn.

171
00:09:06,941 --> 00:09:08,240
What about him?

172
00:09:08,242 --> 00:09:09,775
Want you to keep an eye on him for me.

173
00:09:09,777 --> 00:09:11,810
We're not your watchdogs.

174
00:09:11,812 --> 00:09:14,213
Hmm. What was that?

175
00:09:14,215 --> 00:09:17,850
What he meant was, we're
not spies. We're thieves.

176
00:09:17,852 --> 00:09:20,419
Mr. Thawne, I need to speak with you!

177
00:09:21,707 --> 00:09:23,589
I just need five minutes of your time.

178
00:09:23,591 --> 00:09:24,722
Please.

179
00:09:24,725 --> 00:09:27,493
Reality's at stake.
The world isn't right.

180
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,118
Okay, let him go. Let him go.

181
00:09:31,121 --> 00:09:34,500
Let's just... let's
see what he has to say.

182
00:09:34,502 --> 00:09:35,901
It's okay.

183
00:09:35,903 --> 00:09:39,271
He intentionally hit me in the ribs.

184
00:09:39,273 --> 00:09:42,041
First of all, awesome office.

185
00:09:42,043 --> 00:09:44,009
I guess it pays to be the
smartest man in the world,

186
00:09:44,011 --> 00:09:47,246
which is why I've come to you for help.

187
00:09:47,248 --> 00:09:50,282
You were saying that
the world isn't right.

188
00:09:50,284 --> 00:09:52,985
Yeah, this world we're in now is wrong.

189
00:09:52,987 --> 00:09:56,722
Reality has, uh, has changed somehow.

190
00:09:57,725 --> 00:09:59,792
How do you know all this?

191
00:09:59,794 --> 00:10:01,960
Um, well, there's signs everywhere

192
00:10:01,962 --> 00:10:05,230
if you know where to look.
There's subtle inconsistencies

193
00:10:05,232 --> 00:10:08,267
in the fabric... of reality.

194
00:10:08,269 --> 00:10:10,903
Um, I call 'em scars.

195
00:10:10,905 --> 00:10:13,205
You know, like, after
you've been operated on.

196
00:10:13,207 --> 00:10:17,843
Well, um, reality has been operated on.

197
00:10:19,013 --> 00:10:20,679
Truly fascinating.

198
00:10:20,681 --> 00:10:23,048
I'm giddy with excitement.

199
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:24,483
What's that got to do with him?

200
00:10:24,485 --> 00:10:27,786
Well, um, Mr. Thawne
could help me fix it.

201
00:10:27,788 --> 00:10:29,955
Look, right, you're a genius.

202
00:10:29,957 --> 00:10:33,025
You figured out cold fusion.
You saved the polar bears,

203
00:10:33,027 --> 00:10:34,626
you fixed global warming.

204
00:10:34,628 --> 00:10:37,329
I mean, you made
desalination sustainable.

205
00:10:37,331 --> 00:10:41,500
I mean, you solve problems
like this, like, every day.

206
00:10:41,502 --> 00:10:45,771
If anyone... anyone can figure
out why these scars exist

207
00:10:45,773 --> 00:10:49,274
and how to put the world
back to the way it was...

208
00:10:49,276 --> 00:10:51,810
it's you, dude.

209
00:10:54,782 --> 00:10:57,483
You know what?

210
00:10:57,485 --> 00:10:59,385
I think you're on to something.

211
00:10:59,387 --> 00:11:00,519
Ah.

212
00:11:00,521 --> 00:11:02,312
Something is definitely

213
00:11:02,315 --> 00:11:03,589
not right here.

214
00:11:03,591 --> 00:11:06,258
Fix it. Take mister...

215
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,626
- Heywood.
- Mr. Heywood.

216
00:11:07,628 --> 00:11:10,162
Take Mr. Heywood out for some fresh air.

217
00:11:10,164 --> 00:11:11,797
And, uh, kill him.

218
00:11:14,268 --> 00:11:15,734
Me?

219
00:11:19,511 --> 00:11:20,876
Look, I don't understand.

220
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:23,741
If this is about my work,
nobody pays attention to it.

221
00:11:23,744 --> 00:11:25,543
My mom's the only person
that reads my blog.

222
00:11:25,545 --> 00:11:27,712
Stop talking.

223
00:11:27,714 --> 00:11:32,817
Guys, I am not a threat to
anyone... unless I'm right.

224
00:11:36,456 --> 00:11:37,822
Am I right?

225
00:11:37,824 --> 00:11:40,058
Sounds like fitting final words to me.

226
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:45,630
Whatever... science or magic
altered reality must have left

227
00:11:45,632 --> 00:11:48,733
small scars on my memory that
my subconscious picked up on.

228
00:11:48,735 --> 00:11:51,303
So if I'm not a conspiracy theorist

229
00:11:51,305 --> 00:11:53,405
no one listens to, then...

230
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:55,907
Who am I?

231
00:11:55,909 --> 00:11:56,975
- Dead.
- Wait.

232
00:11:56,977 --> 00:11:58,476
- What?
- He said, "Wait."

233
00:11:58,478 --> 00:12:00,545
I heard him. He said, "Wait."

234
00:12:00,547 --> 00:12:03,315
You promised me things were
gonna be like old times.

235
00:12:03,317 --> 00:12:05,884
It is like old times, only better.

236
00:12:05,886 --> 00:12:08,386
Central City is ours. No more Flash.

237
00:12:08,388 --> 00:12:10,755
Except another speedster's
calling the shots.

238
00:12:10,757 --> 00:12:12,257
You leave Thawne to me.

239
00:12:12,259 --> 00:12:14,292
I always have a plan. You know this.

240
00:12:14,294 --> 00:12:15,560
Well, fill me in.

241
00:12:15,562 --> 00:12:17,128
When the time is right.

242
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:18,930
Ah, yes, we're partners,

243
00:12:18,932 --> 00:12:21,933
except when you refuse to
tell me what's going on.

244
00:12:25,772 --> 00:12:27,305
You son of a...

245
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:33,144
Sorry, buddy. I owed you that.

246
00:12:34,047 --> 00:12:37,048
You saved my life. Why?

247
00:12:38,218 --> 00:12:40,485
Because I'm an idiot.

248
00:12:40,487 --> 00:12:43,888
This could be one of my scars talking,

249
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:47,359
but I'm sensing you're
telling me the truth.

250
00:12:47,361 --> 00:12:49,594
Let's move.

251
00:12:49,596 --> 00:12:50,962
Okay.

252
00:12:55,902 --> 00:12:58,636
This is crazier than
any of my crazy theories.

253
00:12:58,638 --> 00:13:02,240
You're trying to tell me a group
called "The Legion of Doom"

254
00:13:02,243 --> 00:13:04,509
you something called
it "Spearing of Destiny"

255
00:13:04,511 --> 00:13:06,411
to rewrite reality?

256
00:13:06,413 --> 00:13:09,114
Who even names something
"Legion of Doom"?

257
00:13:09,116 --> 00:13:10,315
You did.

258
00:13:10,317 --> 00:13:12,650
Me?

259
00:13:12,652 --> 00:13:14,686
Now, do you only
remember the old reality

260
00:13:14,688 --> 00:13:17,122
because you're part of the Legion?

261
00:13:17,124 --> 00:13:19,891
I'm not part of anything.

262
00:13:19,893 --> 00:13:22,360
I just made a terrible mistake.

263
00:13:35,175 --> 00:13:36,741
You filthy aliens.

264
00:13:36,743 --> 00:13:39,477
Come on, wait a minute.

265
00:13:39,479 --> 00:13:41,179
This is the guy who's gonna fix reality?

266
00:13:41,181 --> 00:13:43,415
- Uh-huh.
- Uh...

267
00:13:43,417 --> 00:13:46,418
who are you guys, and, um,
what are you doing here?

268
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,733
We need your help.

269
00:13:47,736 --> 00:13:49,487
What do you got, like, a
clogged toilet or something?

270
00:13:49,489 --> 00:13:51,389
'Cause, you know,
I'm... I'm off duty now.

271
00:13:51,391 --> 00:13:53,158
You're not a janitor.

272
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,393
Yeah, I am, man. It
says so on my name...

273
00:13:55,395 --> 00:13:56,694
On my name tag.

274
00:13:56,696 --> 00:14:00,365
You're a geek, a nerd, a genius.

275
00:14:00,367 --> 00:14:02,100
That's why we're here.

276
00:14:02,102 --> 00:14:03,735
Oh, is this about the dipole magnets

277
00:14:03,737 --> 00:14:05,136
that I borrowed from S.T.A.R. Labs?

278
00:14:05,138 --> 00:14:06,771
'Cause I'm totally gonna return those.

279
00:14:06,773 --> 00:14:08,473
Look, man,

280
00:14:08,475 --> 00:14:10,875
he said you're the one
that could fix this reality.

281
00:14:10,877 --> 00:14:12,944
Fix this reality?

282
00:14:12,946 --> 00:14:14,412
What do you mean?

283
00:14:14,414 --> 00:14:16,848
You guys think there's
something wrong too?

284
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:18,216
- Whoa.
- Oh!

285
00:14:18,218 --> 00:14:19,784
That's... that's private stuff, man.

286
00:14:19,786 --> 00:14:20,819
What is it?

287
00:14:20,821 --> 00:14:22,620
Um, I don't know exactly.

288
00:14:22,621 --> 00:14:24,783
I mean... I mean, I think
I know, but I don't...

289
00:14:24,786 --> 00:14:26,752
Spit it out, haircut.

290
00:14:26,755 --> 00:14:29,727
Well, um, I ki...

291
00:14:29,729 --> 00:14:31,629
I kinda built it on impulse.

292
00:14:31,631 --> 00:14:34,382
You know, like, on instinct.

293
00:14:34,385 --> 00:14:38,166
I call it, uh, a
Transreality Multiplexer.

294
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:41,070
No real reason. Just
thought it sounded cool.

295
00:14:41,073 --> 00:14:42,832
Don't you get it, man?

296
00:14:42,835 --> 00:14:47,078
Your impulse was a reality scar
working on your subconscious.

297
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,246
Reality scar.

298
00:14:48,248 --> 00:14:50,014
So, uh, what does this fun gun do?

299
00:14:50,016 --> 00:14:52,050
Uh, theoretically,

300
00:14:52,052 --> 00:14:54,886
it targets irregularities
in the hippocampus,

301
00:14:54,888 --> 00:14:57,822
acting like a "Control-Z" for memories.

302
00:14:57,824 --> 00:14:59,390
"Control-Z"?

303
00:14:59,392 --> 00:15:01,392
Like an undo command on a computer.

304
00:15:01,394 --> 00:15:02,660
Oh.

305
00:15:02,662 --> 00:15:03,995
Well, I was gonna try the new version

306
00:15:03,997 --> 00:15:05,330
on my latest test subject,

307
00:15:05,332 --> 00:15:08,533
but then I was worried
it might melt his brain.

308
00:15:09,336 --> 00:15:10,468
Axel.

309
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:12,303
No, it's Tesla, actually.

310
00:15:12,305 --> 00:15:13,872
He looks more like an Indiana to me.

311
00:15:13,874 --> 00:15:15,607
No, he's Axel.

312
00:15:15,609 --> 00:15:18,476
You gave me that little
guy for Christmas.

313
00:15:18,478 --> 00:15:20,879
You haven't been running
any tests on him, have you?

314
00:15:20,881 --> 00:15:22,313
What? No.

315
00:15:23,383 --> 00:15:26,184
Whoa. Whoa! No, no! No!

316
00:15:26,186 --> 00:15:27,418
All right, I think
actually for it to work

317
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,786
you have to shoot him in the head.

318
00:15:28,788 --> 00:15:29,888
Why would you say that?

319
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:32,123
Hey, how many people

320
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:33,858
are gonna point guns at me today?

321
00:15:37,097 --> 00:15:38,763
Oh, my God, you killed him!

322
00:15:44,838 --> 00:15:46,638
You son of a bitch.

323
00:15:49,676 --> 00:15:52,010
It works.

324
00:15:52,012 --> 00:15:54,379
So, Mr. Rory's having second thoughts?

325
00:15:54,381 --> 00:15:58,316
Mick's just a little
confused. I can control him.

326
00:15:58,318 --> 00:15:59,551
Obviously you can't.

327
00:15:59,553 --> 00:16:01,286
Yes, I can.

328
00:16:01,288 --> 00:16:04,589
I just need your help getting
him back on the reservation,

329
00:16:04,591 --> 00:16:06,991
before Thawne finds out.

330
00:16:06,993 --> 00:16:08,726
We have bigger problems.

331
00:16:08,728 --> 00:16:10,895
What if Heywood's only the
first of his old teammates

332
00:16:10,897 --> 00:16:13,264
Mr. Rory's feeling nostalgic for?

333
00:16:13,266 --> 00:16:15,066
I knew we should've killed them all.

334
00:16:15,068 --> 00:16:16,946
It was a dangerous oversight

335
00:16:16,949 --> 00:16:19,104
to keep them alive in any capacity.

336
00:16:19,105 --> 00:16:20,738
Does that include Mick?

337
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:24,175
At the very least we
should've wiped his brain,

338
00:16:24,177 --> 00:16:25,910
such as it is.

339
00:16:25,912 --> 00:16:28,213
You trusted your buddy
a little too much.

340
00:16:28,215 --> 00:16:29,981
Calm yourself, Malcolm.

341
00:16:29,983 --> 00:16:32,884
We'll have Mr. Rory back
before he does too much damage.

342
00:16:34,354 --> 00:16:35,720
Yes, boss?

343
00:16:36,923 --> 00:16:38,990
Mick Rory's got himself lost.

344
00:16:38,992 --> 00:16:40,892
Find him, would you?

345
00:16:42,996 --> 00:16:45,063
Where do you suggest
we start our search?

346
00:16:45,065 --> 00:16:49,234
You can track him with
this. I put a GPS in Mick.

347
00:16:50,904 --> 00:16:53,137
I don't trust anyone.

348
00:16:55,842 --> 00:16:57,008
Okay, on the count of three.

349
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:58,209
One...

350
00:16:58,211 --> 00:16:59,644
two...

351
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:05,216
Oh.

352
00:17:05,218 --> 00:17:06,618
You!

353
00:17:10,423 --> 00:17:11,756
I deserved that.

354
00:17:11,758 --> 00:17:13,358
Damn straight you did.

355
00:17:13,361 --> 00:17:16,194
Hey, if it wasn't for
me, you'd all be dead.

356
00:17:16,196 --> 00:17:17,428
Yeah, Mick, thanks a lot.

357
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:19,530
You trapped each of us
in our own personal hell.

358
00:17:19,532 --> 00:17:22,667
Do you have any idea how
many toilets I've cleaned?

359
00:17:24,104 --> 00:17:25,603
So many.

360
00:17:32,178 --> 00:17:33,344
Amaya.

361
00:17:33,346 --> 00:17:34,579
Sara.

362
00:17:34,581 --> 00:17:36,047
Hey, dumbasses,

363
00:17:36,049 --> 00:17:37,982
they have no clue who you are.

364
00:17:37,984 --> 00:17:40,418
They work for Damien Darhk.

365
00:17:42,289 --> 00:17:43,621
Oh!

366
00:17:43,623 --> 00:17:45,290
Crap.

367
00:17:53,385 --> 00:17:55,192
I don't like the way
she's looking at us.

368
00:17:55,194 --> 00:17:57,161
I like the way she's looking at us.

369
00:17:57,163 --> 00:17:58,785
Love the suits.

370
00:18:11,344 --> 00:18:13,945
Get off my friend!

371
00:18:13,947 --> 00:18:16,213
All right guys, time out,
come on. Come on, look.

372
00:18:16,215 --> 00:18:18,115
I know this may sound
crazy, but doesn't it seem

373
00:18:18,117 --> 00:18:20,117
like there's something
wrong with this world?

374
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:22,753
Yeah. Rory sold out the boss.

375
00:18:22,755 --> 00:18:24,622
To throw in with you losers.

376
00:18:24,624 --> 00:18:26,857
Losers? I'll have you
know in my reality,

377
00:18:26,859 --> 00:18:29,511
you and I had sex, and we
both liked it very much.

378
00:18:29,514 --> 00:18:30,660
Nate, not helping.

379
00:18:30,663 --> 00:18:31,793
Amaya, look at me.

380
00:18:31,796 --> 00:18:34,780
Tell me you don't recognize me,
like, deep in your subconscious.

381
00:18:37,537 --> 00:18:39,570
Come... look, this isn't
how it's supposed to be.

382
00:18:39,572 --> 00:18:41,973
Okay, you're supposed
to be heroes like us.

383
00:18:41,975 --> 00:18:44,875
Okay. Allow me...

384
00:18:44,877 --> 00:18:48,279
to demonstrate my superpowers. Okay?

385
00:18:52,748 --> 00:18:53,947
Knock it off, you idiot.

386
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:55,842
The Spear took away your powers.

387
00:18:55,845 --> 00:18:56,952
But it's true.

388
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:58,210
Nate used to be able to steel up,

389
00:18:58,212 --> 00:19:01,694
and I had a robotic exoskeleton
that allowed me to shrink.

390
00:19:01,696 --> 00:19:04,196
Oh...

391
00:19:04,198 --> 00:19:06,599
These guys are heroes.

392
00:19:06,601 --> 00:19:09,168
That is so great.

393
00:19:10,504 --> 00:19:11,971
We kill heroes.

394
00:19:11,973 --> 00:19:13,339
Aw.

395
00:19:36,564 --> 00:19:39,665
One more person hits
me, I'm gonna punch back.

396
00:19:39,667 --> 00:19:40,833
What the hell happened to me?

397
00:19:40,835 --> 00:19:42,101
It appears that after the Legion

398
00:19:42,103 --> 00:19:43,903
got the Spear and changed reality,

399
00:19:43,905 --> 00:19:46,205
they kept us around as their pets.

400
00:19:46,207 --> 00:19:48,007
Yeah, except for you.

401
00:19:48,009 --> 00:19:50,309
You helped the Legion steal the Spear!

402
00:19:50,311 --> 00:19:53,112
Speaking of, the Legion's
probably on their way here

403
00:19:53,114 --> 00:19:55,247
to kill us. We need to get out of here.

404
00:19:55,249 --> 00:19:58,450
Yeah. Gotta find someplace to hide.

405
00:20:01,489 --> 00:20:03,455
Your mom's basement?

406
00:20:03,457 --> 00:20:05,190
Really?

407
00:20:05,192 --> 00:20:08,360
I pay rent, so legally
it's my basement, kinda.

408
00:20:08,362 --> 00:20:10,529
Mommy makes great sandwiches.

409
00:20:10,531 --> 00:20:12,231
The best. It's the perfect amount

410
00:20:12,233 --> 00:20:15,067
of mayo/meat/bread ratio
that really gives it...

411
00:20:15,069 --> 00:20:17,770
Focus! We need to figure out

412
00:20:17,772 --> 00:20:19,672
how we can rescue the rest of the team,

413
00:20:19,674 --> 00:20:21,540
and get the Spear back so we can undo

414
00:20:21,542 --> 00:20:23,008
everything the Legion has done.

415
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:24,109
Except now they know we're trying

416
00:20:24,111 --> 00:20:25,878
to get the band back together.

417
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,213
Except they don't know
that you've gotten to me,

418
00:20:28,215 --> 00:20:30,249
- which means...
- You can sneak into the Legion

419
00:20:30,251 --> 00:20:32,484
and pretend to be
Darhk's favorite chick.

420
00:20:32,486 --> 00:20:34,853
It's our best shot
at getting Amaya back.

421
00:20:34,855 --> 00:20:37,189
All right. What about
the rest of the team?

422
00:20:37,191 --> 00:20:40,025
Well, the Professor and Jax are working

423
00:20:40,027 --> 00:20:43,329
on some secret project for Thawne.

424
00:20:43,331 --> 00:20:44,930
I don't know where the Englishman is.

425
00:20:44,932 --> 00:20:47,066
Neither do it.

426
00:20:47,068 --> 00:20:49,635
Mmm. I can only imagine
how those psychopaths

427
00:20:49,637 --> 00:20:51,804
are torturing Rip.

428
00:20:54,229 --> 00:20:55,708
Gideon! I've discovered

429
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:57,977
the missing ingredient for my recipe.

430
00:21:00,781 --> 00:21:02,815
Rum.

431
00:21:05,853 --> 00:21:07,586
And speaking of which,
I'm gonna need you

432
00:21:07,588 --> 00:21:10,125
to fabricate me another bottle of it.

433
00:21:10,128 --> 00:21:11,924
Ooh, and some nachos.

434
00:21:11,926 --> 00:21:13,625
I will do nothing of the sort.

435
00:21:13,627 --> 00:21:15,327
What?

436
00:21:15,329 --> 00:21:18,130
You will do as I tell you,
Gideon, I'm your captain!

437
00:21:18,132 --> 00:21:20,733
Then it's time for you
to start acting like one.

438
00:21:20,735 --> 00:21:24,703
Now, sit up straight and show
your backbone, Captain Hunter.

439
00:21:24,705 --> 00:21:27,873
Gideon, for the thousandth time,

440
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:30,476
I've got no way of getting
the reserve power back online,

441
00:21:30,478 --> 00:21:31,944
and I've got no way of...

442
00:21:31,946 --> 00:21:34,947
Of sending out any signal of any sort,

443
00:21:34,949 --> 00:21:37,883
which means...

444
00:21:37,885 --> 00:21:43,522
Which means that I am destined
to live out the rest of my days

445
00:21:43,524 --> 00:21:47,326
right... here...

446
00:21:47,328 --> 00:21:48,927
with you.

447
00:21:48,929 --> 00:21:51,363
While you were honing
your confectionary skills,

448
00:21:51,365 --> 00:21:53,132
I've been working on new algorithms

449
00:21:53,134 --> 00:21:55,701
to redirect power from the
idle quadrants of the ship.

450
00:21:55,703 --> 00:21:57,803
You need to focus on
boosting your distress signal

451
00:21:57,805 --> 00:21:59,972
once power is fully back online.

452
00:21:59,974 --> 00:22:01,940
Now, chin up, Captain.

453
00:22:05,913 --> 00:22:08,647
I don't know if I can do this, Gideon.

454
00:22:08,649 --> 00:22:10,276
I believe in you.

455
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:12,384
Now, let's get to work.

456
00:22:14,488 --> 00:22:16,288
First...

457
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:18,123
I'm going to vomit.

458
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:22,327
And second...

459
00:22:22,329 --> 00:22:24,530
let's do this.

460
00:22:27,468 --> 00:22:29,468
When your minions bring Mick back,

461
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:31,937
I want to arrange a meeting with Thawne.

462
00:22:31,939 --> 00:22:33,872
When I say "arrange
a meeting," I mean...

463
00:22:33,874 --> 00:22:35,707
One between Thawne and his maker?

464
00:22:35,709 --> 00:22:39,011
Cute. A little
mustache-twirly for my taste.

465
00:22:39,013 --> 00:22:40,179
You're really gonna have to

466
00:22:40,181 --> 00:22:42,181
step up your tactics, Leonard.

467
00:22:42,183 --> 00:22:43,682
Yeah, you didn't think that Thawne was

468
00:22:43,684 --> 00:22:45,284
actually gonna fall for
that fake meeting trick?

469
00:22:45,286 --> 00:22:46,785
This is not "The Godfather."

470
00:22:46,787 --> 00:22:48,420
Although we do agree
with your sentiment.

471
00:22:48,422 --> 00:22:49,888
Eobard has to go.

472
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:51,657
So glad you both approve.

473
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:54,126
Which brings us back to
our original conundrum.

474
00:22:54,128 --> 00:22:56,328
How to kill a speedster.

475
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:59,431
We found your partner,

476
00:22:59,433 --> 00:23:01,100
and he's got himself some friends.

477
00:23:01,102 --> 00:23:04,203
And where, pray tell, is
your partner, Miss Lance?

478
00:23:04,205 --> 00:23:06,180
We got separated in the fight.

479
00:23:06,183 --> 00:23:07,782
I haven't heard from her since,

480
00:23:07,785 --> 00:23:11,076
so I'm guessing she's dead by now.

481
00:23:11,078 --> 00:23:12,611
Ah, that's the thing about Sara Lance,

482
00:23:12,613 --> 00:23:14,513
she never stays dead for very long.

483
00:23:14,515 --> 00:23:16,615
Sorry, we underestimated them.

484
00:23:16,617 --> 00:23:18,750
Won't happen again. We'll fix this.

485
00:23:18,752 --> 00:23:20,385
- Let's go.
- Oh...

486
00:23:20,387 --> 00:23:23,555
not so fast.

487
00:23:24,374 --> 00:23:25,406
Yes?

488
00:23:27,895 --> 00:23:32,097
I have a question for you.

489
00:23:32,098 --> 00:23:35,266
Which one is your favorite trophy?

490
00:23:35,269 --> 00:23:38,537
That's like asking a girl to
pick just one pair of shoes.

491
00:23:38,539 --> 00:23:43,275
Oh, please, everyone
has their favorite kill.

492
00:23:43,277 --> 00:23:45,277
You want to hear mine?

493
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:49,982
Her name was Black Canary.

494
00:23:49,984 --> 00:23:53,852
I will never forget her. Hmm.

495
00:23:53,854 --> 00:23:57,823
It was so... delicious,

496
00:23:57,825 --> 00:23:59,725
killing her.

497
00:23:59,727 --> 00:24:01,493
They told me that I'd done it before,

498
00:24:01,495 --> 00:24:03,996
but I can't imagine it ever getting old.

499
00:24:07,468 --> 00:24:09,434
The very first thing
I did in this reality

500
00:24:09,436 --> 00:24:11,103
was acquire my magic.

501
00:24:14,808 --> 00:24:17,576
I'm gonna miss you, Ms. Lance.

502
00:24:17,578 --> 00:24:19,945
Having you around to
attend to my every whim

503
00:24:19,947 --> 00:24:21,513
was too enticing to pass up.

504
00:24:21,515 --> 00:24:24,316
Plus, it's so hard to
find good help these days.

505
00:24:24,318 --> 00:24:27,786
Really? Now's the time
for a bad guy monologue?

506
00:24:27,788 --> 00:24:30,155
You should've killed me
when you had the chance.

507
00:24:30,157 --> 00:24:32,824
No better time than the present.

508
00:24:32,826 --> 00:24:36,261
Amaya, the honor is yours.

509
00:24:40,534 --> 00:24:42,201
Good-bye.

510
00:24:46,173 --> 00:24:47,172
What the hell?

511
00:24:47,174 --> 00:24:49,341
Shoot now. Explain later.

512
00:24:55,983 --> 00:24:58,383
Damien, what did I tell you?

513
00:24:58,385 --> 00:24:59,918
For what it's worth,

514
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,354
I thought it was a very
good bad guy monologue.

515
00:25:11,036 --> 00:25:12,903
Everything's on schedule, Mr. Thawne.

516
00:25:12,905 --> 00:25:15,072
You have nothing to worry about.

517
00:25:15,074 --> 00:25:16,707
Hey.

518
00:25:16,709 --> 00:25:19,076
What do you want?

519
00:25:21,213 --> 00:25:23,213
There's just one thing
I don't understand.

520
00:25:23,215 --> 00:25:26,049
If Thawne made this world to punish us,

521
00:25:26,051 --> 00:25:28,886
how are your mom's
sandwiches so good, bro?

522
00:25:28,888 --> 00:25:30,687
Her condiment game's on point, right?

523
00:25:30,689 --> 00:25:32,022
- Mmm.
- She even had

524
00:25:32,024 --> 00:25:33,457
gluten-free bread for me.

525
00:25:33,459 --> 00:25:35,459
Look, let's just get back to the ship.

526
00:25:35,461 --> 00:25:36,894
We don't know where the ship is,

527
00:25:36,896 --> 00:25:38,662
or Rip, which means our next move

528
00:25:38,664 --> 00:25:40,397
should be to rescue the Professor.

529
00:25:40,399 --> 00:25:42,900
Speaking of which, what did
Thone have you to working on?

530
00:25:42,902 --> 00:25:44,501
Grey did most of the work, and...

531
00:25:44,503 --> 00:25:46,603
I just made his life hell.

532
00:25:46,605 --> 00:25:48,338
But from what I could tell,

533
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,174
he was building some sort of reactor.

534
00:25:50,176 --> 00:25:51,809
He said it would burn
a thousand times hotter

535
00:25:51,811 --> 00:25:53,310
than the sun once it's operational.

536
00:25:53,312 --> 00:25:54,878
I like the sound of that.

537
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,148
Could be a power generator,
a particle accelerator.

538
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:00,751
What if Thawne is trying
to destroy the Spear?

539
00:26:00,753 --> 00:26:02,554
Uh-uh, impossible. You
need the blood of Christ

540
00:26:02,556 --> 00:26:05,260
to destroy it. That's why Rip
broke it up into so many pieces.

541
00:26:05,263 --> 00:26:08,030
Unless he figured out there's
another way, by incinerating it.

542
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:10,134
But why would Thawne
want to destroy the Spear?

543
00:26:11,497 --> 00:26:13,297
Oh, no.

544
00:26:13,299 --> 00:26:15,432
If he destroys the Spear,

545
00:26:15,434 --> 00:26:19,536
that means this
reality cannot be rewritten.

546
00:26:22,708 --> 00:26:25,275
Okay, we better get that Spear
before he can make that happen.

547
00:26:25,277 --> 00:26:26,710
But even if we find it,

548
00:26:26,712 --> 00:26:29,546
we don't know how to access its powers.

549
00:26:29,548 --> 00:26:32,216
Rory does. You were there,
right, when they used the Spear?

550
00:26:32,218 --> 00:26:34,218
Mm-hmm. They read out of some book

551
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,953
called the, uh, "Calibrick"...

552
00:26:35,955 --> 00:26:37,120
"Cal"... "Caliber"...

553
00:26:37,122 --> 00:26:40,123
"Kalablow"... "Kalabalos"...

554
00:26:40,125 --> 00:26:41,792
Uh, something like that.

555
00:26:41,794 --> 00:26:43,494
Do you remember what language it was in?

556
00:26:43,496 --> 00:26:45,262
Aramaic.

557
00:26:45,264 --> 00:26:47,831
Dude, how do you even know
what Aramaic sounds like?

558
00:26:47,833 --> 00:26:50,801
"Passion of the Christ". Good movie.

559
00:26:50,803 --> 00:26:53,140
Mick, would you be able to
recognize the incantation?

560
00:26:53,143 --> 00:26:54,171
Yeah.

561
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:01,578
Hey. If they figure out this incantation

562
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:03,847
and we get our hands on the Spear,

563
00:27:03,849 --> 00:27:05,349
I want you to use it.

564
00:27:05,351 --> 00:27:07,351
I should have listened to
you back in World War I.

565
00:27:07,353 --> 00:27:09,486
If we had used the Spear
when we had the chance...

566
00:27:09,488 --> 00:27:10,521
I might have been tempted to use it

567
00:27:10,523 --> 00:27:13,023
to change my own future.

568
00:27:13,025 --> 00:27:16,627
Now... we've got nothing to lose.

569
00:27:16,629 --> 00:27:20,531
Oh, Marty, Marty, Marty.

570
00:27:20,533 --> 00:27:22,933
I know you've been working
so hard on this project,

571
00:27:22,935 --> 00:27:24,968
and I wanted to come
by and say thank you,

572
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:28,839
but if it doesn't come online
in the next few minutes,

573
00:27:28,841 --> 00:27:30,327
I'll have to kill you.

574
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:32,609
One... one moment, Mr. Thawne, I...

575
00:27:32,611 --> 00:27:34,511
I just need one more moment.

576
00:27:42,755 --> 00:27:44,488
There. There.

577
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:46,957
As you can see, the machine
appears to be fully functional,

578
00:27:46,959 --> 00:27:48,458
though it may take some time

579
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:51,161
for the core to reach peak temperature.

580
00:27:51,163 --> 00:27:53,697
Well, then you'll stay until it does.

581
00:27:53,699 --> 00:27:57,100
I-I was hoping to
see my family tonight.

582
00:27:57,102 --> 00:28:00,270
Oh, no. No, no, no, you can't
leave in your moment of glory.

583
00:28:00,272 --> 00:28:01,705
You keep monitoring the core

584
00:28:01,707 --> 00:28:04,508
and make sure the
reaction remains stable.

585
00:28:06,845 --> 00:28:09,112
Think we got something.

586
00:28:09,114 --> 00:28:11,882
We pieced together a passage
from the "Kalabros."

587
00:28:11,884 --> 00:28:13,450
AKA the word of God.

588
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,186
All right, Jax, it's on you

589
00:28:16,188 --> 00:28:18,293
to restore Stein's mind
before we get to the lab.

590
00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:19,890
We gotta destroy the reactor

591
00:28:19,892 --> 00:28:21,758
before Thawne can destroy the Spear.

592
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,260
- Yeah, no doubt.
- Now, remember,

593
00:28:23,262 --> 00:28:25,729
you guys are going in
there without your powers.

594
00:28:25,731 --> 00:28:27,798
Don't worry. I know that
place like the back of my hand.

595
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,999
What about Mick?

596
00:28:29,001 --> 00:28:31,268
Mick's staying here.

597
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:33,203
We can't trust him.

598
00:28:33,205 --> 00:28:35,105
Not after what you've done.

599
00:28:35,107 --> 00:28:37,741
After what I've done?
If it wasn't for me,

600
00:28:37,743 --> 00:28:40,310
you'd all be walking around like sheep.

601
00:28:40,312 --> 00:28:42,713
If it wasn't for you,
we never would have been

602
00:28:42,715 --> 00:28:46,483
turned into sheep in the first place.

603
00:28:46,485 --> 00:28:47,951
We trusted you, Mick.

604
00:28:47,953 --> 00:28:51,254
We can't afford to
make that mistake again.

605
00:28:51,256 --> 00:28:53,590
Let's go.

606
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:14,411
League of losers cut you loose?

607
00:29:14,413 --> 00:29:17,447
Nobody cuts me loose.

608
00:29:17,449 --> 00:29:19,816
I'm done with those people.

609
00:29:19,818 --> 00:29:22,819
What do you say we burn
this city to the ground?

610
00:29:25,391 --> 00:29:28,659
Knowing Sara, she's
rallied the team by now.

611
00:29:28,661 --> 00:29:30,894
Those idiots aren't
whom I'm worried about.

612
00:29:30,896 --> 00:29:36,033
Relax, boys. Prodigal son has returned.

613
00:29:36,035 --> 00:29:37,834
And he's got some news for us.

614
00:29:37,836 --> 00:29:40,003
Isn't that right, Mick?

615
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:46,443
Our old friend Eobard has built
a device to destroy the Spear.

616
00:29:46,445 --> 00:29:48,412
No wonder Eobard
doesn't want us using it

617
00:29:48,414 --> 00:29:50,614
before he locks in his
own version of reality.

618
00:29:50,616 --> 00:29:52,716
Which I assume means erasing all of us.

619
00:29:52,718 --> 00:29:54,284
And your pals.

620
00:29:54,286 --> 00:29:56,829
My pals.

621
00:29:56,832 --> 00:29:59,899
They want to steal the
Spear before the deed's done.

622
00:29:59,901 --> 00:30:02,569
I think you can see what
I'm getting at, gentlemen.

623
00:30:02,571 --> 00:30:04,437
The four of us are no
match for a speedster,

624
00:30:04,439 --> 00:30:06,306
so while Thawne is
fighting the Legends...

625
00:30:06,308 --> 00:30:08,875
We'll grab the Spear from
under both their noses.

626
00:30:08,877 --> 00:30:12,846
Exactly. The enemy of my enemy...

627
00:30:12,848 --> 00:30:15,448
Is our opportunity.

628
00:30:31,457 --> 00:30:33,690
The status of the machine, Doctor?

629
00:30:34,878 --> 00:30:36,994
Please tell Mr. Thawne I'm
working as fast as I can.

630
00:30:36,996 --> 00:30:39,396
I've powered up the
reactor. I just need to make

631
00:30:39,398 --> 00:30:40,964
a few adjustments to the core.

632
00:30:40,966 --> 00:30:42,699
Did you already turn it on?

633
00:30:42,701 --> 00:30:46,236
I-I had specific instructions
from Mr. Thawne to do so.

634
00:30:46,238 --> 00:30:48,171
Grey, we need to talk.

635
00:30:48,173 --> 00:30:49,573
Grey?

636
00:30:51,076 --> 00:30:53,277
Please, don't...

637
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:55,279
Don't kill me, I've done
everything Mr. Thawne wanted.

638
00:30:55,281 --> 00:30:57,581
I'm not gonna kill you. I'm
just gonna make you better.

639
00:31:00,351 --> 00:31:01,984
Grey, what have you done?

640
00:31:01,987 --> 00:31:03,486
If Mr. Thawne wants to kill me,

641
00:31:03,489 --> 00:31:04,755
he'll have to do it himself.

642
00:31:07,493 --> 00:31:10,794
Guys, we got a problem.
You gotta get here ASAP.

643
00:31:10,796 --> 00:31:12,963
We're at the building.
Just keep him there.

644
00:31:12,965 --> 00:31:15,399
Ray, find us the quickest
way into the lab, now.

645
00:31:15,401 --> 00:31:17,834
Look, you gotta believe me, okay?

646
00:31:17,836 --> 00:31:19,970
This is not the way it's supposed to be.

647
00:31:19,972 --> 00:31:22,673
Is this some sort of test of my loyalty?

648
00:31:22,675 --> 00:31:23,874
Does Mr. Thawne even care?

649
00:31:23,876 --> 00:31:25,409
Look, this isn't about Thawne.

650
00:31:25,411 --> 00:31:26,910
It's about you and me.

651
00:31:26,912 --> 00:31:29,713
I assure you, my... my
dedication to Mr. Thawne

652
00:31:29,715 --> 00:31:31,214
has never been stronger.

653
00:31:34,086 --> 00:31:36,320
Did you just press the silent alarm?

654
00:31:36,322 --> 00:31:38,955
What? No, it's...

655
00:31:38,957 --> 00:31:42,392
It's a secondary radiation
sensor for the nuclear core.

656
00:31:42,394 --> 00:31:46,530
Grey, you are a crappy
liar in any reality.

657
00:31:46,532 --> 00:31:48,732
Martin.

658
00:31:49,735 --> 00:31:51,201
I can't talk any sense into him,

659
00:31:51,203 --> 00:31:52,602
and he just triggered an alarm.

660
00:31:52,604 --> 00:31:54,738
Which means Thawne'll be here soon.

661
00:31:57,209 --> 00:31:59,076
Or now.

662
00:31:59,078 --> 00:32:04,314
Well, looks like you losers
managed to remember who you are.

663
00:32:06,051 --> 00:32:07,617
I should've wiped you from existence

664
00:32:07,619 --> 00:32:09,052
when I had the chance.

665
00:32:09,054 --> 00:32:13,890
Do you have any idea
how infuriating it is

666
00:32:13,892 --> 00:32:17,127
to know that Merlyn was right?

667
00:32:17,129 --> 00:32:21,264
Lucky for you, I still believe
in some fates worse than death.

668
00:32:21,266 --> 00:32:22,566
Like me destroying the Spear

669
00:32:22,568 --> 00:32:25,469
and cementing this reality for all time.

670
00:32:30,943 --> 00:32:32,809
Martin.

671
00:32:32,811 --> 00:32:35,312
The reactor is fully operational, sir.

672
00:32:35,314 --> 00:32:36,747
This...

673
00:32:36,749 --> 00:32:39,383
is the only reality

674
00:32:39,385 --> 00:32:40,984
any of you

675
00:32:40,986 --> 00:32:42,452
will ever know.

676
00:32:42,454 --> 00:32:44,688
We'll never give up trying to stop you.

677
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:46,990
Well...

678
00:32:46,992 --> 00:32:48,892
if it weren't for your futile efforts,

679
00:32:48,894 --> 00:32:50,594
this wouldn't be half so sweet.

680
00:32:52,698 --> 00:32:56,166
Not so fast, speedy. You
have something we want.

681
00:32:56,168 --> 00:32:59,369
You need a lesson in how
to share your toys, Eobard.

682
00:32:59,371 --> 00:33:01,838
Yeah, time for us to get
a turn with the Spear.

683
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,841
And do what with it?

684
00:33:04,843 --> 00:33:08,779
Don't you understand? I'm trying
to protect you from yourselves.

685
00:33:08,781 --> 00:33:10,213
With the Spear destroyed...

686
00:33:10,215 --> 00:33:11,648
Bored now.

687
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,420
Get the Spear!

688
00:33:33,472 --> 00:33:35,439
- Ah!
- Let go of the Spear,

689
00:33:35,441 --> 00:33:38,008
and I won't use it to
turn you into a jockstrap.

690
00:33:46,685 --> 00:33:48,819
Yeah!

691
00:33:50,756 --> 00:33:52,422
Uh, perhaps not.

692
00:33:54,793 --> 00:33:55,992
Ahh.

693
00:33:59,731 --> 00:34:01,164
Give it up!

694
00:34:06,338 --> 00:34:07,871
Oh, Sara.

695
00:34:07,873 --> 00:34:10,173
Why do we always find
ourselves in this situation?

696
00:34:10,175 --> 00:34:11,475
'Cause you keep finding yourself

697
00:34:11,477 --> 00:34:12,966
on the wrong side of history.

698
00:34:41,306 --> 00:34:42,873
Aah!

699
00:34:45,711 --> 00:34:48,211
Nice work, Mick.

700
00:34:48,213 --> 00:34:50,881
Now hand it over.

701
00:34:50,883 --> 00:34:53,517
Mick, no. You already
gave it to him once.

702
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:54,618
You know what happened.

703
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:55,550
That was Thawne.

704
00:34:55,553 --> 00:34:57,187
This time will be different, big boy.

705
00:34:57,189 --> 00:34:58,622
Don't do this, Mick.

706
00:35:00,459 --> 00:35:03,827
Mick, I don't care
what anyone else thinks.

707
00:35:03,829 --> 00:35:05,662
I still believe in you.

708
00:35:07,699 --> 00:35:10,333
Enough! Mick...

709
00:35:12,571 --> 00:35:14,070
Hand it over.

710
00:35:16,837 --> 00:35:18,675
Like a good boy.

711
00:35:18,677 --> 00:35:21,811
You mean a good dog.

712
00:35:21,813 --> 00:35:24,247
That's all I am to you.

713
00:35:24,249 --> 00:35:26,149
An attack dog.

714
00:35:26,151 --> 00:35:28,385
Now, that's not true.

715
00:35:28,387 --> 00:35:31,488
Sure, we both know you're not
the sharpest tool in the shed,

716
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:36,259
but that's why we're partners, remember?

717
00:35:37,308 --> 00:35:38,986
You're right.

718
00:35:41,934 --> 00:35:43,600
I'm not a genius.

719
00:35:48,206 --> 00:35:52,442
But I'm not one's dog,
Leonard. Not anymore.

720
00:35:55,981 --> 00:35:57,380
Well.

721
00:35:58,684 --> 00:36:03,386
I guess you can teach
an old dog new tricks.

722
00:36:06,291 --> 00:36:07,891
Undo this mess.

723
00:36:38,957 --> 00:36:43,927
I am sorry about your friend, Mick.

724
00:36:43,929 --> 00:36:46,696
I know you loved her to pieces.

725
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,366
No!

726
00:37:13,625 --> 00:37:16,359
Well, if you want
something done right...

727
00:37:16,361 --> 00:37:17,927
Well done, Leonard.

728
00:37:19,264 --> 00:37:20,730
You bastard.

729
00:37:20,732 --> 00:37:22,732
I'll kill you all.

730
00:37:23,631 --> 00:37:25,698
Actually, I believe that's my line.

731
00:37:27,305 --> 00:37:30,840
Now, where were we before
I was so rudely interrupted?

732
00:37:59,237 --> 00:38:01,171
Well...

733
00:38:01,173 --> 00:38:02,772
I guess we're done here.

734
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,639
You know the really swell thing

735
00:38:26,641 --> 00:38:28,575
about the Spear being destroyed?

736
00:38:30,412 --> 00:38:32,579
Now you can't stop us from killing you.

737
00:38:32,581 --> 00:38:36,015
Oh, please. Don't insult my intelligence.

738
00:38:36,017 --> 00:38:37,417
Even at your fastest,

739
00:38:37,419 --> 00:38:39,152
you're moving in slow motion to me.

740
00:38:39,154 --> 00:38:41,321
Except they're not alone.

741
00:38:41,323 --> 00:38:44,524
I say we go down fighting.

742
00:38:45,324 --> 00:38:48,728
You kill one of us, we kill all of you.

743
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:51,297
For Amaya.

744
00:38:51,299 --> 00:38:53,099
Don't.

745
00:38:53,101 --> 00:38:56,236
Even if you survive my men,
you'll never survive me,

746
00:38:56,238 --> 00:39:00,240
not without powers or weapons.

747
00:39:00,243 --> 00:39:04,945
And the truth is, I don't want
to see any more of you dead.

748
00:39:04,946 --> 00:39:08,047
Not out of sentiment, of course.
No, no, quite the opposite.

749
00:39:08,049 --> 00:39:12,185
But because it is so...

750
00:39:12,187 --> 00:39:14,087
delicious,

751
00:39:14,089 --> 00:39:16,456
knowing that you'll be
forced to live your lives

752
00:39:16,458 --> 00:39:20,860
in a reality that I...
Well, that we created.

753
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:23,930
You will walk this world knowing

754
00:39:23,932 --> 00:39:25,899
that something isn't quite right,

755
00:39:25,901 --> 00:39:30,003
that for all your trying
you only made things worse,

756
00:39:30,005 --> 00:39:32,438
and no one will ever believe
you when you tell them

757
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,541
about all the sacrifices you made

758
00:39:34,543 --> 00:39:37,644
and how close you came to being Legends.

759
00:39:41,798 --> 00:39:44,117
Now, that sounds like a
fitting punishment to me.

760
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:46,786
What do you think, Professor Stein?

761
00:39:46,788 --> 00:39:48,321
I don't care what you do to them,

762
00:39:48,323 --> 00:39:51,090
as long as I never have
to see Mr. Jackson again.

763
00:39:51,092 --> 00:39:53,693
Ah.

764
00:39:53,695 --> 00:39:57,030
Fair enough.

765
00:39:57,032 --> 00:39:58,565
You're free to go.

766
00:39:58,567 --> 00:40:00,166
You're just gonna let them walk?

767
00:40:00,168 --> 00:40:01,601
Be glad I'm letting you

768
00:40:01,603 --> 00:40:03,837
and your fellow traitors do the same.

769
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:09,175
And the next time any of you get
what you think is a smart idea,

770
00:40:09,176 --> 00:40:12,211
remember this grace.

771
00:40:12,214 --> 00:40:13,847
And the fact I could kill any of you

772
00:40:13,849 --> 00:40:16,583
in the blink of an eye.

773
00:40:21,323 --> 00:40:24,090
My mom's not gonna be cool with that.

774
00:40:24,092 --> 00:40:26,960
Do I look like I give a damn?

775
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:30,296
I can't believe that's it.

776
00:40:30,298 --> 00:40:32,599
I refuse to believe that this is it.

777
00:40:32,601 --> 00:40:34,033
Without the Spear, there's no way

778
00:40:34,035 --> 00:40:36,502
we can undo any of this.

779
00:40:36,504 --> 00:40:38,872
There is one way.

780
00:40:38,874 --> 00:40:40,640
Time travel.

781
00:40:40,642 --> 00:40:42,242
What do you mean?

782
00:40:42,244 --> 00:40:45,211
We go back in time to 1916,

783
00:40:45,213 --> 00:40:46,880
and we stop the Legion from ever getting

784
00:40:46,882 --> 00:40:48,548
the Spear of Destiny in the first place.

785
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:51,551
No, we are not supposed to change

786
00:40:51,553 --> 00:40:53,052
events we participated in.

787
00:40:53,054 --> 00:40:56,489
And if we do, we risk
time folding in on itself.

788
00:40:56,491 --> 00:41:01,027
Even if we weren't worried
about messing with time,

789
00:41:01,029 --> 00:41:03,897
we can't go anywhere. Or anywhen.

790
00:41:03,899 --> 00:41:05,932
We don't even know
where the Waverider is.

791
00:41:05,934 --> 00:41:07,800
If it even exists in this reality.

792
00:41:07,802 --> 00:41:09,202
Well, if it does, there's one person

793
00:41:09,204 --> 00:41:12,872
who knows where it is.

794
00:41:12,874 --> 00:41:15,508
We just have to find him.

795
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:17,243
I've directed all available power

796
00:41:17,245 --> 00:41:19,379
to the main navigational
controls, Captain.

797
00:41:19,381 --> 00:41:20,980
Thank you, Gideon.

798
00:41:20,982 --> 00:41:23,716
Now, I've started the
communications protocol,

799
00:41:23,718 --> 00:41:27,987
and if I just splice
these two wires together...

800
00:41:29,858 --> 00:41:32,792
Your distress signal will be broadcast.

801
00:41:34,329 --> 00:41:36,329
Surely the rest of the team

802
00:41:36,331 --> 00:41:38,965
must be out there somewhere, listening.

803
00:41:55,763 --> 00:42:01,255
